Aah! Oh, great! Emmy! You be quiet! It's me. Open up. Emmy! The sinner... shall have no preference of whom she corrupts... emmy. No home... emmy! No name... emmy! No face. Whoo! He's out! What? What are you talking about? You're blind! He's out! He never touched him! He touched him with his glove! He had the ball in the other hand! Who are you working for? You've been sniffing on something? Get out of here. One more word, and you're gone. Go on! Come on. Let's go. Go get 'em! All right, zephyrs. Go get 'em! Vicki, sit down. Huh? Beeks! Yeah? You're in. I'm in? Yeah. The game's on the line, jack. He's a stiff! Put vicki back in. We want to win this game. And so does beeks! Everybody plays. Those are the rules. Come on. Give me a break. Jesus christ! Batter, batter, batter, batter! No! Beeks, no! No! Beeks, no! Oh! Oh! Oh! Throw! Come on. Get the ball! Come on! Oh, jesus christ! How could you put beeks in? He's cost us two games already. His father paid for the uniforms. We are the best-dressed losers, but he sucks. George, you know the rules. Everybody plays. Things won't be so cozy between you and vick since you replaced her. Nothing's going on between us. Fine. Hey, gents. We found her last night lying over a boulder in griffith park. No i.d. she had a little silver cross next to her. That's it. No clothes, nothing. And whoever raped her really did a good job. Then there's her face. Well, there is no face. Somebody used a combat knife on her. We counted 112 strokes. He went to the cheekbones on some of them. O.k. how old is she? Couldn't be more than 20. Mmm, 22, maybe. She bled to death. He sliced clean through her carotid artery-- after he cut her up. Jack, you think there's enough left so you can sketch what she used to look like? Get a photographer in here. I can't-- jack. I can't do it, all right? I'll work off a photograph. Jack! Hey, slugger. Tough loss, huh? It's the best out of three. Don't worry. Anything can happen. Thought you had a vacation coming. Starting tomorrow. But, uh, i'll be ready on saturday. I'll be there, too. Hey, coach gandhi. Don't bother me, zip. Jack, rosenthal called. She wants the model of the bank done by monday. Shit. Bug somebody else. I'm busy. You're about to get busier. Our fun boy with the cutlery? We got an eyewitness. Really? Emmy o'conner. She's in your office. There's just one thing. What? She's blind. What? She can't see. That's funny. Mrs. O'conner? Emmy. Yes. In case they haven't told you, you're in the pigsty of jack whitfield. And you're mr. Whitfield. Can i get you coffee? Bonnie! No, really. I'm fine. You sure? Have a seat here. We'll get started. You'll have to help me. Here we go. You need anything, jack? No. No, thanks, bonnie. Thank you. Here. Right here. Um... this is, uh... this is going to be a little tough for me. Going to be very hard for me, too, but then i have the advantage of not seeing your expressions. Guess this seems fairly ridiculous to everyone. No, no. It's just that, uh... but it is, really, isn't it? No. It... yeah, it is. I mean, i don't understand. You saw? I was able to touch the man who attacked me. I touched his face. I'm here to describe him. Are you ready to listen? Hot dog--mustard, hold the chili. You're in court today, huh, lieutenant? What makes you say that? "Hold the chili." I get crap on my shirt. Ha ha! You got a problem, loman? Everybody knows about you and chili. Lieutenant. Look who's here. Hello, gina. What are you press guys doing here, slumming? We're just back from missing persons. Another woman's reported missing. Think it might have anything to do with the slasher case? "Slasher case?" Not very original. You know how many missing persons reports are filed in a day? A little birdie tells me you have an eyewitness. Your little birdie's cuckoo. O.k., but you will let me know if you stumble across one, right? Make my editors very happy. How could i resist all that sultry greek charm? Yeah, right. Try a blindfold. Excuse us, please? Yeah. When did the mpr come in? About an hour ago. Same approximate age as the first woman. She was a student at usc. The blind lady? She's with whitfield. Georgie's talking with the husband. Anything else in common besides the knife? It's him, unless some other psycho leaves a silver cross at the scene after he carves someone up. You're kidding me. Same exact kind, too. He's probably got a shoebox full right next to his prozac. We got anything else? Yeah. We have a blind eyewitness. Is that terrific or what? It says here, uh, you told the detective he was 6 feet tall? Yes. My feet touched his ankles. Was he, uh... was he heavy? Was he a big man? Uh, heavyset, strong. About 200 pounds. Yeah. O.k. so you said his face was round and full? Yes. He had a... a thick chin. It was a double chin. Mm-hmm. And his skin was soft. I can't really draw that. No, but i thought it might give you an idea of his age. He had stubble, but it wasn't coarse. Would you say he was 20, 25, 30? 30. Yes, his hair was short, very straight, maybe finger-length. O.k. that's good. We'll have to wing it on the color. It was brownish. How do you know? I touched his hair. It was very fine and silky, almost limp. I've been blind since i was 11, and i... well, there's other ways to see. Other ways? What do you mean? Yes. Would you? Your hair is fine. It's a touch oily. Is it brownish as well? Yes. Your skin still has moisture in it... although your beard is coarse. You're 35 or 36. I'm 36, and my hair is brown. Can you do this with everything? Not everything. Organic things, yes, sometimes. It's easier in the sun because each color absorbs a different amount of heat. Mr. O'conner, it usually takes our sketch artist about an hour, so your wife should be here any minute. We're also going to have to take another look at your home. You guys have had a pretty good look already. What else are you going to find there? This is just a routine follow-up. What about his eyes? Did you touch his eyes? Can you describe them? Yes. They were close set, very large, round... with deep eye sockets. Mm-hmm. And his nose? It was wide, came to a point. The cartilage in the front was rippled, like maybe he had broken it, and he had a hard time breathing through it. How about his mouth? His mouth was soft, for what he was saying. What was he saying? He was saying something religious, maybe from the bible, i don't know. I don't remember it. The upper lip had a pronounced break, like a "v," and his bottom lip was full and turned out. Both lips were very smooth, moist. O.k. do you remember anything else? Did you touch a scar? No. Just that he was going to kill me. He was wearing thin rubber gloves, and he had his hand over my mouth, and i knew he was going to kill me. And then my husband came home. Your husband? Yes. He's--he's waiting for me. Are we finished? Mr. O'conner, there's some very good rape crisis centers around town. I'd be happy to give you some numbers. Thank you. Hi. You o.k.? Hi. Yeah. I'm jack. Hi. Glenn. How'd it go? Thanks to your wife, we have a description now. Mrs. O'conner, i've got to go over your schedule with you-- when you're at college-- in case i need to contact you. O.k. are you a student? No. A teacher. I teach three nights a week at the hollywood community college. Glenn and i both teach there. My desk is right in front of us. Thanks. I can't believe she gave you this. Let me see this again. It's all from her description. What do you say, lieutenant? All of us care about this woman's safety, but we're dealing with a potential serial killer here. I want this guy mummified. We got to run the sketch. What if he sees it and goes after this poor girl? Just hand it out to our guys. Give it a chance. Jack, we can put surveillance on the o'conner place. So a couple guys can catch up on their sleep? Never mind that bullshit. You're worried about one woman's safety. What about everybody else's? I'm just asking you to wait a week. If we don't catch this guy in a week, give it to the media. This guy never lets up. I give you till tuesday. Thanks, dave. God willing, we'll get lucky. Get out, will you, please? I got a headache. You know, i've seen that show, man-- house of fashion. I know it's something, man. There's got to be some correlation between spandex and the increase in middle-aged coronaries. Don't kid yourself. Next time i hear, "you don't look a day over 35," i'm going to puke. Besides, once they find out i'm divorced, they head for the hills. That's your problem, man. You got to make that work for you, jack. I would. O.k. i'll work on that, don juan. There you go. Hi. Come on in. Hello, glenn. Hello, detective. Mrs. O'conner. Jack. Hello, emmy. Listen, if i don't leave now, i'm going to be late for a class. Go on, glenn. I'll be all right. You sure? Mm-hmm. Jack's going to do a floor plan, and i'm going to talk to neighbors. I'm blocking you in, so i'll get out of your way. Bye. Bye. Shall we start? Yeah. I just need to make a quick sketch of, uh... yes, i know. Nice house. Yeah, used to be. Now i'm not so sure. I was coming from the bathroom. Uh, emmy, i'm just going to take a few polaroids, all right? O.k. um... it was hot. We had the... the doors open for a breeze. Just a few moments after i came in here, i... i knew that someone was in the room with me. I could smell perspiration. It was like... wires burning. It was foreign. I... i know glenn's scent. And then i started... heading for the door, and... and that's when he grabbed me. And he put the blade of the knife against my face. Then he dragged me to the ground. You know, i've... i've already told the police about the actual rape. I'm... finished in here. I mean, i just, uh... just need to take a couple measurements, and i'm going to get out of here. I'm sorry. I'm just not so sure about everything. I mean, i come in, and i tell you what i know, and you get him, but that's not the way things work out, obviously. There's a unit that cruises the house every 15 minutes. O.k.? You're safe, and we have your description of the guy. We'll catch him. Are you all right? You must be exhausted. Hey, what time did you get to bed, finally? It was late. Um, i don't know. I had to prepare for a class. You stayed up late the night before, too. Yeah. I wasn't tired. Your students must be happy to have you back. Yeah. You have great kids this year, you know that? Yeah, i do. I do. Listen, is there something i could do? Anything? Anything at all? No. But my legs are falling asleep. Ooh! One of the detectives mentioned this rape crisis center. Yeah. Can we talk about this later? Yeah, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. Where are you going? I'm going to go take my walk. Don't you have a class to go to? Look, let me go with you. Glenn, i feel like i'm on the witness protection program. It's broad daylight, and there's people everywhere. I just want to be by myself. Are you nodding or scowling? A little bit of both. Go ahead. Just don't be long. Stay back. Wait, wait, wait. This is a crime scene. Stay right where you are. That's our guy. Same stroke pattern, wound depth, recent vaginal penetration. It's like the first one and the o'conner woman--no semen-- but i think i know why. Yeah? I found traces of a... of a lubricant. I can't tell till i get it back to the lab, but i think it's stuff they use to package condoms. He left another cross. So, time of death? Well, cool air plays games with rigor mortis, but i'd say 6:00, maybe 6:30. Oh, we got a new twist, guys. He sodomized this one, probably after she died. Guy's full of warmth and compassion, ain't he? They've got a couple surfers. Found the body, claim they know her. Let's go. Come on, rusty. Let's go! Come on, boy. Let's go. Please move away from me! Hello, emmy. Shh! Listen to me. If you cooperate with the police, anyone who knows must die. You... glenn... anyone you have tainted with this foul lie. I cannot allow you or anyone to stop me, emmy. Don't let me down. Glenn! Emmy? Glenn! Emmy! Emmy, i'm here. What's wrong? He's here. He's on the park bench. Where? Em, em, what did he say to you? It's o.k. it's o.k. i'm betty oates with kmea news at 8:00. We have just learned that the only democrat to serve as an ambassador under the bush administration... peanuts are stale, sheila. Well, at least they're free. ...his candidacy today. David stein, who's a wealthy philanthropist, had recently married top model melissa jamison... you know, if i had any pull around here, which i don't... ha ha! I think i'd have the health board shut this joint down. Yeah? And you'd lose the only place you got where you don't have to talk to anybody, jack. I come here for the company. The body of another woman has been found... tell it to the marines. Just north of malibu. Police believe there is a connection between these murders. Inside sources are telling us there has been an incredible development in this case. A possible eyewitness has been found, but there is a hitch-- this eyewitness is blind. Jack! She allegedly survived an attack by a knife-wielding rapist who police believe is responsible for the brutal murders of the two women. While police have refused to comment on any details regarding this witness, kmea learned she's in her 20s and teaches at a local college. This sketch was composed... let me use the phone. ...descriptions allegedly given by the blind woman. Police say they have a mounting body of... yeah? Sturges, you see the news? A black-and-white's rolling to the o'conner place-- in financial news, yesterday's 62-point tumble put the dow at... shit! Sheila, call metro. Tell them to send a unit to the community college. O.k., o.k. community college. Which one? Jack, which one? All right. Everyone have a nice weekend. See you next week. Jennifer, wait up. Jennifer. Thank you. Wait up, diane. Wait up. Hello. Hey, excuse me. Is there a blind teacher on campus? Do you know of a blind teacher here? There's a blind lady in the theater department. Theater. Yeah, where's that? That's, uh, theater department's boscum hall, about three-- i knew you'd do it. As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout... so is a fair woman without discretion. Hey! Ugh! Hold it. Who are you? Aah! Uh! Uh! Jack! Emmy! It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Ohh... son of a bitch! Listen, jack, the dispatcher got the wrong place. Yeah. Well, he didn't. Emmy! Emmy! Glenn. Emmy! It's all right. I'm here. Shh! I'm here. What the hell is wrong with you people? Why can't you stop him? Come on. It's all right. It's all right. So did you see him at all, jack? He's a big guy. That's what i saw. He's big. He's got dark hair. Yeah. Well, that doesn't help me much. How about his face? It was too dark. I couldn't see. Did you see anything? O.k. listen. A few kids over here recognized him from your sketch, and we also have a partial on his ride. It was an older model bluish-gray chrysler, maybe a le baron. Look at this doofus. Is he serious? Only got one brake light, too. Yeah. Well... pull him over, take some of his money before vegas gets all of it. How are you, officer? Can i see your license and registration, please? Of course. Nice day, isn't it? Here you go. Where you headed, mr. Rothko-- blackjack tables? No. I'm not very good at games of chance. Actually, i'm on my way to a bible study retreat in nevada, if this old piece of junk can make one more trip. Well, you might not make it with that broken taillight and this seat belt dangling out your door. Oh... i'm sorry. Shit! O.k., tim. Oh, that's timothy. O.k., timothy. Today's your lucky day. I'm going to strongly suggest that you wear that seat belt, and i'm going to give you what we call a "fix or nix" ticket on your brake light. O.k. come on. Give me some juice. Your autograph. Fix or nix ticket, huh? Mm-hmm. Tell me something, officer. If i were to, say, sell or junk the car, would i still be responsible for, uh, this citation? Here we go. To tell you the truth, i don't really know how that works. Yeah. If you just-- out of the car! Out of the car! Hands where i can see them! Nice and slow. Knock knock. Yeah. Just, uh, stopped in to see how you're doing. How's the arm? Oh, i'm in stitches over it. Ha ha ha! What a bummer. I guess you won't be playing much softball. Ooh! No. I don't think so, sherman. Not for a while. But you'll still be coaching, won't you? Yeah. Because we need you out there, jack. You know that. I'll be there for you, sherman. Huh... aah! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hang in there, sport. Oh, yeah. This is... i'm sorry. Ah! Yo, jack! They just got the son of a bitch. Chp picked him up 20 minutes ago just outside of needles on a routine violation. Timothy... my name is lawrence walker. I'm an attorney. I'm here to represent you, and i was sent by your father. He said you smoke this brand. Poor father. He must be devastated. He wants me to convey to you that every attempt to clear your name will be thoroughly explored. That's father, all right. Now, we have a hearing to determine bail disposition of the 26th. Do you understand the charges brought against you? I am guilty... of no wrongdoing. O.k. do you believe me, mr. Walker? What i believe is of little consequence. I'm here to make the jury believe you. Now, the police want to put you in a line-up and have this blind woman identify you by touch. I'm not afraid to face my accusers. All right. Halfway down now. Oh, good. I want to thank you both for coming down. This is our prosecuting attorney, miss victoria rosenthal. Mr. O'conner, ms. O'conner. I don't understand. You already have a sketch. Why put her through this? I'm sorry for having to bring her here, but it's crucial to our case. O.k. then i'm going in there with her. Sorry. We can't allow that. All right. Then we're going home. Glenn... it's all right. Let's just do this and get it over with. All the men in the line-up, except the suspect, work here. He'll be shackled and handcuffed, and there'll be two armed guards in there the entire time. It should only take about five minutes. That's how long the rape took. Can we do this, please? Thank you. This way, miss. Get me out of here. Get me out of here. Get me out of here! Damn it! George, give them a hand, will you? O.k. i'm going to try this case, but winning? Here we go. Number one-- rothko's father retained malamud, walker, and skiles. Hold on, hold on. Where'd he get that kind of cash? R & d investments, wall street brokerage house. Guess what the "r" stands for. Larry walker will eat us alive on the murder charges. We'll prosecute, but our best shot right now is rape with enhancement, deadly weapon, bodily harm. With a blind witness. Bullshit, vicki. Murder one. Hey, listen to me, dave-- no, no, no. You listen to me. We're looking for a lefty, according to the coroner. We got one, and we've got a pattern. He stalks college campuses. He follows girls home, rapes and murders them, then leaves a cross. It doesn't matter. We find a bible in his car with all kinds of underlined passages about women, and we got witnesses who saw him at the college the night the security guard was murdered. Oh, really. Well, jack was there. Does that mean he killed the security guard? Oh, come on. We got the murder weapon, right? A knife, knife gouges in the o'conner woman's home. You have a knife, a clean knife, and a knife that i'm told happens to be a popular item with no less than 70,000 hunters in this county. Never mind that bullshit. What about the o'conner woman, for christ's sake? She described him. She had the cross he left. Then she picks the son of a bitch out of a line-up! First of all, i don't think we even have emmy o'conner. She's unwilling to cooperate. We have to subpoena her, and even if we did, the defense will rip my head off. She's blind! I need more! We have another witness. Who? Whitfield. Jack whitfield saw rothko. Georgie says you told him in the college parking lot that you saw him. That's not what he told me, lieutenant. Did somebody ask you something? Well, how about it, jack? Jack, you saw what georgie fished out of rothko's car. You know damn well he's our killer. Come on now. Work with me. Rothko did it, jack. We might not even need the girl. I saw somebody his size. Will you just say it, for christ's sake? Lieutenant, come on. Give him a break. The guy cut him. When we got to jack, he was practically going into shock. Yeah. Well, now it's my turn. Did you or didn't you see him, whitfield? No. I did not see his face. Fumble. Great. Just... great. Just great. I'm going to do a follow-up on the colleges, poke around a little bit. In the meantime, i got the lab boys going over rothko's apartment with a goddamn electron microscope, so maybe they'll come up with something. Yeah. Maybe another hacked-up dead girl. You know, i can't believe you, whitfield. Listen. Why don't you just can it? Why don't you can it? No. Really, whitfield. Other day, you're crying about protecting this girl. Now you're coming on with this shit like everybody's asking altar boy jack to rat on the pope. This is an animal that hacks up girls for fun, and you're setting him free! Hey, jack. Come on. God! Come on, whitfield! I'll kick your ass! Fuck you. Hey, jack! Forget about the girl. It's you who are blind! In local news, the timothy rothko trial entered its fifth day of proceedings with a motion for dismissal from defense attorney lawrence walker. After more than five months of legal maneuvering, rothko's lawyers are privately optimistic over their chances for acquittal. Speculation continues as to just how long assistant district attorney victoria rosenthal will pursue the case without benefit of testimony from a prime witness, college instructor emma lou o'conner. Rothko has been charged with the rape and attempted murder of mrs. O'conner. She is rosenthal's only witness and the key to the prosecution's case. All right. Let's have a little quiet in here, please. Counselor. Can you state your name and occupation, please? My name is dr. Sydney burroughs. I'm a licensed pathologist employed by the county of los angeles. Can you tell the court the nature of your relationship to this case? I was the attending pathologist who performed autopsies on the two female decedents, sandra hayes and erin kirkwood. Were there any similarities in the physical conditions of these women with regard to the wounds they suffered at the time of their deaths? Yes. There were dramatic similarities. Both women suffered very deep and numerous lacerations-- numerous? What--10, 20? Over 100 in each case. The victims' facial features were virtually obliterated. Can you tell us how these wounds were inflicted? By evaluating the wound characteristics, the depth, width, tissue trauma, nerve damage, the probable instrument used was a remington combat knife. Is there anything else you could tell us about the characteristics of these wounds? Yes. Judging by the angle of the wounds and the kind of pressure required to create the kind of lacerations, i'd have to say the assailant was left-handed. Dr. Burroughs, is the defendant left-handed or right-handed? Left-handed. Can you tell the court what percentage of the population is left-handed? The figure stands at about 10 %. In the united states, the figure drops to just under 7 %. I have here a copy of your autopsy report. It states that a white petroleum silicate was found to be present in both women. Can you tell me what this substance is? Yes. It's a lubricating fluid that's used in the packaging of condoms. From the actual chemical analysis of the petroleum silicate, were you able to determine a specific brand name of the condoms? Yes. It's called percival. Thank you. No further questions. Oh, thank you. An identical silver cross was found with each of the two dead girls, and the assailant who attacked ms. O'conner left the very same type of cross with her. Thank you, detective. Now, would you tell the jury what you found when you searched the defendant's vehicle just after his arrest? We found a bible with passages underlined in red ink, and all of them had to do with women. Your honor, for the record, i'm holding a bible previously marked people's exhibit number three. Detective... could you read the inscription on the inside cover of the bible? Yeah. It reads, uh... "to my loving son, timothy." Thank you. What else was found during your search? We found numerous parking slips and tickets to five local area colleges. We found a remington hunting knife, and we also found a box of condoms. And what brand of condoms, detective? Percivals. Thank you. Your witness. Just one question, detective rydell. Have you ever purchased a percival condom? Objection! Your honor, our intent here is certainly not to humiliate or embarrass a witness. Simply to establish the preponderance of this product. You may answer the question, detective rydell. Well, uh... well, yeah, but that was quite a long time ago. Thank you, detective. And though you haven't purchased one in some time, you'll be happy to know that it hasn't hurt sales. The percival condom, according to this report, submitted as exhibit d, your honor, is the second-largest selling condom in the united states. For your perusal. No further questions. O.k. well, let's adjourn for the day, folks. Here. Let me help you with that. Thanks. You're not that easy to get ahold of. I've been calling you for weeks, you know. Oh, yeah. We haven't been home much lately. We've been looking at houses, thinking about moving. Yeah? Mm-hmm. How's glenn? He's good. Oh, i'm sorry. This freezer. We don't have any ice. The only cold thing i can offer you, i think, is milk. Oh, that's all right. I'll just drink the warm tea. You sure? Oh, yeah. This is fine. Uh, where are your glasses? Right over here. I'm flattered. You showered for me. Yeah. Washed my hair, and, uh... i even ironed my shirt. Really? Yeah. Come on. As a matter of fact, it's a brand-new shirt. It's blue. Blue. It's got a little green and gray. You'd like it. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Thank you. Here you go. Thanks. They're... they're going to subpoena me. That's why you're here, isn't it? Um... yes, they are. But i'm here because i... also wanted to see you. I'm glad. I'm glad i get to see you, too. Is that because you're leaving? I saw the tickets on the refrigerator. Montana. We're going to see glenn's parents for a while. Without you, there's a good possibility that this guy won't be convicted. With me, there's a good possibility, too. Right? You know, when you came into my office, emmy, i have to say i did have my doubts. Blind witness. But, uh... i think you're amazing. I do. To go through what you went through, i don't think i could have-- as a matter of fact, i know i couldn't have done that. But we have to finish what we started. He's out on the street, jack. His lawyer described him as a deeply religious man, and then they set him out on bail. Without you, we have no case. With me, you have no case! I've done everything. I've tried. It doesn't help! I don't want to go through my hatred and my shame! I don't want to stand in front of all those people and have them stare at me! No! Let me talk to glenn. No! It's not going to change anything. Jack, please just leave, o.k.? Emmy... please. O.k. you do know they'll come looking for you. Will you tell them where we're going? No, i won't. Larry walker is a killer. Don't let him rile you. I'll be fine. I'll be cool. You mean, like you were on the arnold case? Hey, you won that case. In spite of you, not because. Here's our reply brief on the motion to suppress. Now, walker's not going to bite on this whole schoolroom scenario. He knows he's got us by the short hairs there. My guess is he'll come at you with everything he has on the sketch. You got the article? Yeah, yeah. O.k. good. Now, don't bring it out unless he gives you an opening. We can always introduce it as evidence later. And be cool. I'm cool, cool, cool. Fix your tie. O.k. let's go. O.k. you stated that you saw this individual from behind as he stabbed the security guard in the corridor. Can you describe this person? Well, he's about 6 feet tall, heavyset, dark brown hair. Your honor, may this drawing be marked people's exhibit number five. Did you make this drawing, mr. Whitfield? Yes, i did. It's a floor plan of the classroom and the corridor where the attack took place. Mr. Whitfield, what did you do immediately after you saw the suspect running away? I ran into the corridor and pulled the fire alarm, and then i heard mrs. O'conner scream. Did you find or encounter anyone other than ms. O'conner? No. Is there any other way out of this building other than the corridor through which the killer exited-- a window, a side door perhaps? Well, there's another door at the other end of the corridor, but that was locked. Then would it be correct to assume that the same individual who attacked both you and ms. O'conner in the classroom is the same individual who killed the security guard? Yes. It had to be. Thank you. Mr. Whitfield... you composed this sketch from a description provided for you by mrs. O'conner, who is blind. Is that correct? Yes. Let's talk about this sketch for a minute, shall we? Now, we already heard you testify that mrs. O'conner told you she managed to run her hands over her attacker's face. Well, that might explain the shape, perhaps the nose, but the hair color? How could she tell what color her attacker's hair was if she is blind, mr. Whitfield? Mrs. O'conner's been blind since she was a child. Her sense of touch is extremely acute, and she was able to touch her attacker's hair and by the texture, determined that it was brown. I just have such a problem with that. You know, i wish i could have been there. I wish we all could have witnessed such an unbelievable feat. You don't have trouble with that, mr. Whitfield? I did at first. And what is this? It's an article from the los angeles times about a biologist who's been blind since birth. Objection, your honor. The defense has had no time to peruse this material. Let's have a look at this. I'm going to allow this for the time being. Uh... mr. Walker, if at another time, you wish to challenge the veracity of this article, you may do so. You may proceed, mr. Whitfield. Thank you. The biologist had difficulty getting into graduate school because of his blindness, but when he identified 25 different biological specimens by touch... he got in. This hearsay is all very dramatically interesting, mr. Whitfield, but tell me something. In your opinion, has any eyewitness ever provided a more accurate description of a possible suspect than mrs. O'conner did with hers? Well, yes, but-- well, how many? I don't know. Well, one? Two? A dozen? Maybe six or seven. I see. Your honor... the defense submits the following as exhibits h, i, and j. Thank you. Mr. Whitfield, did you make this sketch? Yes. Could you briefly inform the court of the circumstances in which this sketch was made? This man was a murder suspect. His name is byron douglas. Aha. Can you identify the man in this photograph? Byron douglas. Quite a good likeness, wouldn't you say? So good that byron douglas was convicted and spent three years in jail before being acquitted. Is that correct, mr. Whitfield? Please answer yes or no? Yes. Do you know who this is, mr. Whitfield? I believe you do. This is a photograph taken of paul stubin at his arrest. Paul stubin is the man who actually committed the murder-- objection. Irrelevant and argumentative. With your help-- that was the man the witness described to me. You're telling me that you never misinterpret a witness' description? It's pretty damn difficult. And why is that? Why is that, mr. Whitfield? Because i show them the drawing. You show them the drawing. That wasn't so easy to do with mrs. O'conner, was it? No further questions. Hey. What, you didn't hear me banging on the front door? Yeah, i heard you. Drink? No. I'll pass. Why don't you just put a straw in the bottle? Rosenthal asked for a five-day recess, and the judge denied. Looks bad. No, he's out, george. He's out. He's got all his daddy's money, and he's got-- he's got a roomful of lawyers, you know, with the fancy suits, pleading his case. Justice has always been overrated anyway. I could do something. What are you going to do, george? You going to bribe the judge? Listen to me, all right, jack? Yeah. Listen. Rothko doesn't have to make it till monday. What do you mean? We could kill the fuck, jack, just fucking get rid of him. And you want to know something? I know people three times removed who would do it for nothing. Nothing, man. Nothing but a favor later on down the road. Jack. Jack. The guy has no soul, man. George... i think you should go home. I think you ought to go home, and you ought to take your wife into your arms and hold her and... and think about what you just said. See you tomorrow. Ahh. Whoo! Suburbs. How about suburbs? You got suburbs up there? In the town of cheyenne, i have a listing for a lois o'conner on river road. That's got to be it. Give me their number. Sorry, sir. It's an unpublished listing. Oh, come on. This is an emergency. I'm stuck here. Sorry, sir. I'm not allowed. How about the address? Can you give me the address? I gave you the address, sir, on river road. Oh, that's right. Thank you. You're welcome. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god? So help me god. Please state your name. Timothy rothko. Timothy, did you have anything whatsoever to do with the murders of sandra hayes, erin kirkwood, and henry driscoll? No. Have you ever sexually assaulted anyone, timothy? No. Timothy, is this your bible? Yes, it is. If you would flip through the pages for a moment, please. Did you underline those passages? No. I would have no reason to scribble in my bible. And why is that? I consider myself a student of that book, sir. I know the bible nearly word for word. You mean if i were to take this bible and do this... could you recite, say, galatians, chapter 6, verse 12? "For we wrestle not with flesh and blood, "but against principalities, "against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this--" thank you, timothy. Revelations, chapter 3, verse 2. "In the sight of the unwise, they seem to die. "And their departure is taken from misery. "And they're going from us to the utter destruction, but they are in peace." Amen. Amen. So i was going to run over to peter mortenson's and say hello before people started to call us a couple of hermits. Why don't you come? I'm sorry. I just-- i don't feel up to it. O.k. i'll see you later. Bye. Thank you. Yeah, this is nice here, except for the mosquitoes. I think i could get used to this place. It's been in glenn's family since he was little. I used to spend the summers up here. Lois, glenn's mother, wanted to sell it a few years ago, but glenn talked her out of it. Well, that's good. I think that's him now. How did you find us? I saw the tickets on the refrigerator, remember? I also got access to glenn's work files and got lucky on a few things. What do you want, jack? Why are you here? Hello, glenn. Hello, jack. I didn't feel like staying there without you, em. Glad i came back. So, you here to give us the news on the big trial, jack? Do you think because you're out somewhere where nobody can see you that this thing is over? Yes. Yes, i do think it's over. At least for emmy, it's over. No, it's not. It's just beginning. The man who raped your wife-- no, no-- now wait a second. Listen to me. The man who raped your wife, who did this to emmy, he also murdered and raped two other women, and he killed a security guard, and now this guy's going to go free. And then he's going to hurt somebody else, somebody's sister, daughter, somebody else's wife. Yeah, well, it won't be my wife. My only concern is for my wife. I don't want to see her humiliated again. So, please, jack, go win your trial. Just win it some other way. We can't. It's not my concern. Yes, it is your concern. Do you understand that, glenn? It is your concern because nobody else can help me here. Don't you understand? This guy has the best defense attorneys that money can buy, the best, and they'll let him go free. He'll walk the streets again, and he'll do this again. I don't care. I just want you to go away from my house. Stop it! Both of you. You both act as though i'm not even in the room, like i'm not even here. This is my life. I was attacked. I was raped. You know what? I will decide what i am going to do or not do from now on. First of all, let me make it clear that we all perceive you as an extremely courageous woman, mrs. O'conner. Whatever transpired that night at the college had to be unimaginably traumatic. Now, you claim you identified the man who allegedly attacked you in your home by touching his face. Would that be correct? Yes. Did you also touch the face of the man who attacked you in your classroom? No. Well, then how can you be certain that the attacker in your home is the same man who attacked you in your classroom? Because of what he said to me. The biblical references. He said them both times. Mm-hmm. I have here a copy of the statement you gave to the police. In these reports you stated that the first attacker whispered to you. Is that correct? Yes. Now, according to your statements made after the second attack, this attacker, quote, "said to me, i knew you'd do it." Did the second attacker whisper? Objection, your honor. Counsel is making an assumption disguised as fact. Sustained. Proceed, counselor. Mrs. O'conner, did the man who attacked you in your classroom whisper or speak in a normal voice? Normal. Normal. During the first attack, the man whispered. During the second attack, the man spoke normally. Is that correct? Yes. You had no physical contact with the man who attacked you in your classroom, yet you managed to touch the man you say attacked you in your home. Yes, i managed. How long were you able to touch this man, mrs. O'conner? A few seconds? No. It was longer. Much longer? No. Well, how long, then? A half a minute, maybe. I don't remember. Can you tell me why this man who was brutally attacking you would let you run your hands over his face? No, i can't. Can't you? I mean, were you fighting him or pushing him away when you touched him? No, not then, but i had fought him earlier. Oh, so you weren't holding him away or at bay when you touched him. Was this touching, then, more like a caress? No, it wasn't. I tried to make it seem that way. You're telling me that while this man was raping you, threatening you with a knife, you had the presence of mind to make an attempt to identify this man? Is it possible that you might have encouraged him? That you might have even-- i was raped. I was attacked in my bedroom in my own house. Your honor? Mrs. O'conner, i am forced to caution you to please try to contain your emotions. You may continue, counselor. Just one last question, mrs. O'conner, if you please. There really was no way for you to be certain that mr. Whitfield drew the person you had fixed in your mind, is there? Mrs. O'conner, is there? No. Will you please speak so the jury can hear you? No. No further questions. Thank you, mrs. O'conner. The court will recess one hour for lunch. Let's try to get everybody back here by, let's say, 2:00. Vicki! I got an idea. I think it'll work. Let's hear it. I don't know if it'll work. It'll work. We did it before, you and i. We can do it again. Emmy... i know you don't want my opinion right now, but you could nail this guy. Get him. All right. You're telling me you want me to drag someone from the street into the courtroom? Larry, people are knocking down the doors trying to get in here. You won't have any trouble. Now, i suggest you get started. I object to this, and i want it clearly stated for the record. Go ahead, shane. Find someone. Ladies and gentlemen, it has been suggested that a demonstration of mrs. O'conner's manner of identifying her attacker might provide us all with some hard answers. That's what this setup is all about here. Now, the defense has selected a willing citizen literally off the street for mrs. O'conner's examination. Um, bailiff... i must demand complete silence throughout the courtroom during this exercise. Are you ready, mrs. O'conner? Yes. You may begin. If it pleases the court, your honor. Yes, counselor? 30 seconds. Mrs. O'conner claimed earlier that she had contact with her assailant for 30 seconds. You have 30 seconds, mrs. O'conner. You may begin... now. Time. Please remove the volunteer to the anteroom. Bailiff, bring in mr. Whitfield. Hello, emmy. Hi. O.k. emmy, can you describe this person to me? Yes. This person is a man, perhaps 30, 31. His skin is soft-- a little rough around his nose and his cheeks. O.k. now give me something i can draw, emmy. His face is round. He has low, wide cheekbones. His nose is broad, tipped down. He has wide nostrils. Mm-hmm. He has a double chin. What about his mouth, emmy? Tell me about his mouth. His lips are full, but compact, not wide. O.k. how about his eyes? What shape are his eyes? His eyes are almond-shaped. His eyebrows are thick and feathery. O.k. how about his hair, emmy? What's his hair like? I can't. Yes, you can, emmy. Mrs. O'conner, are you able to continue? His hair is straight, finger-length, brushed back off his face. What color is his hair, emmy? I just can't. Yes, you can. Emmy... you can do this. Objection. She'll be fine, your honor. Please, just give us a moment. Mr. Whitfield. Emmy. Just tell me what color his hair is. Please tell me. His hair is thin... and brownish. For the first time since... emmy. I can see people watch me. I really can. It's o.k. it's o.k. thank you, mrs. O'conner. Mr. Whitfield? Mr. Whitfield, may we see your sketch, please? Bring the volunteer in, please. Thank you, emmy. Do not forsake me. Bitch! I should have killed you when i had the chance! I know who you are! You should be thanking me. They're all evil. If i make my bed in hell, thou art there! And god said unto the woman, "what has thou done?" And the woman, the woman said, "the serpent beguiled me, and i did eat." Jack. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for everything. We'll, uh, we'll be waiting for you. Emmy. Thank you for giving me back my life. Beeks, my friend!
