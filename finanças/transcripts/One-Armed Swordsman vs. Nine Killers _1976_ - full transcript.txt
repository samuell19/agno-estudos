(bright music) (upbeat music) (dog barking) (bluegrass music) (sword clinks) (rhythmic music) (dramatic music) - You said to meet you, tonight, midnight, June the sixth. Well, I'm on time. What do you want? - Your life. I'm afraid that today you have to die. In three years, Mung Sing Hung, you kept well. - All right, cut the talk. Where's your sword? - I don't need one, not for this fight. So I didn't bring one. - So you think you're that good? Well, all right then, we'll play your way first. (sword thuds on pole) (dramatic music) (both grunting in fight) - You give me one blow and I'll give you two back. (kick clacking) Oh! So you've changed your mind then. - I am swordsman, that's how I fight. (sword clinks) (scabbard's thudding) - And that's how you're gonna die as well. (sword schwing) (grunting) (sword clinks) (pole creaking) (water splashing) One down, eight to go. - Mung Sing Hung is dead, where? - By Willow Bridge. It seems a one-armed fighter killed him there. - Mung was a damn good fighter. Who was this one-armed man then? - Don't know, he uses a special Kung Fu technique and what's more, he also killed Lo Hsiang Pu. - Oh, where is he? - Tan Valley. (dramatic music) - Tan Valley. (footsteps tapping) - The chessmen ready? - [All Chessmen] Sir! - [Man] Move the canon. Move knight to protect king. (cart squeaking) - Get out of here, go and get out. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Stupid boy. - [Man] Ready sir. - Jump one. (upbeat music) (footsteps tapping) (coughing deliberately) - Huh, you're the one-armed man. We've been waiting for you all day. We're gonna kill you. - You use men instead of chessmen, no value for human life. It's your chief who ought to die. - You killed Mung Sing Hung? - I did. He killed a man once and all his family. I would call it retribution. He deserved it. - You know Mung Sing Hung was my relation. - I know that you're related to many fighters. He was your son-in-law. - Huh! Well let's start. Will you choose Kung-fu or chess? - If we must contest, I'll choose chess. - You'll take black. I'll take white, all right? And the loser must kill himself. - I have no quarrel with you and I don't wanna play chess. If you'll, excuse me. - Hold it. I'm not giving you a choice. - Well, all right then, but who has the advantage of the first move though? You? - I am oldest, so I'll start. - All right. - The men ready? - [Man] Sir. - It's your idea. (footstep tappings) - Right canon, move. - My fort takes your canon. (drumming) - And my Marshall takes your fort. (drumming) (suspense music) (drumming) - My flying knight takes your man. - You know what knights not supposed to fly? - Yeah, well, neither is a Marshall either. - Hold it. You get back. I need no help to fight you. - I'm young, you're old and I have no wish to kill you. Goodbye! (dramatic music) Both Mung and Lo Hsiang Pu were followers of Chu, you're not involved in this. So I only want you to tell me where I can find Chu now? You tell me that, then I'll leave. - Sorry, I don't know. - Well, I'll take your word for that. I trust you. - (thinking) He is a young man and he's trusting. I liked him and I was defeated by him. I've lost my reputation. All my men have seen what happened to me here. There's only one thing to do. (body thudding) - [Man] Master. - [Chu] What? Are you sure of that? That one-armed man mentioned my name. - Yes, sir and killed Mung and Lo. Deliberately picked a fight. - [Chu] You know what his background is? - Not yet. - Huh! They belong to my clan, and the Chu clan is the most powerful there is. I have some of the finest fighters, and nobody goes against me. Not if they want to live. And now some one-armed nobody comes to challenge me. Fu Pai Su. (swards schwing) - Sir. - [Chu] Tai Li Wa, Mo To. - Here. - [Chu] Tang Han. You will issue orders, and must find out who this one-armed man is and quickly too. - [All] Sir. (upbeat music) - Soft green mountains and blue waters. It really makes beautiful picture, doesn't it? - Huh! You're right. And it's getting late, so we can watch the sunset together. - I had thought of that. In fact, that's why I brought you. - I'm very moved. - Huh! Well in that case, see it with me every day. - You really love me that much, do you? - I swear to you, by God. I do love you, that's why I'm doing this, to prove to you. I'm just sorry. I had to do this to you. - Yes, tying me up out here doesn't really make me like you very much, at all. - Promise to be my concubine. If you do, I'll let you go. - I won't. - You won't? Huh! I'll leave you here for another 24 hours to let you think. Once you find out how hot it can get, you may change your mind. So I'll come back here at the same time tomorrow. - You evil beast. - No, I'm not. If I really was, then I'd have raped you. See ya. (suspense music) (footsteps tapping) - Did you feel too hot like that? It's warm. - Well now, if you were me, wouldn't you feel hot? - Like some help? - If you like, help me. If you don't, then don't. I must thank you. - Thank me if you like, if you don't, forget it. - Who was it? Who did such a thing to you? - Yen Hsi Su. - Yen Hsi Su, Chu clan? (joyful music) (all laughing softly) - Drink up. Hey, come on, some food, huh? Hey that's good. - Well all right. Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! - There is a visitor. - Where is he? - Downstairs. - Bring it up. - Yes. (Yen Hsi Su laughing) - [Yen Hsi Su] Come on here. Hey! Have another set of drink. (group laughing) Yeah, sure. Come on, come on. You're looking for me, but tell me, she ready to come and live with me? - If she does, I don't care. Have you got an elder brother? - Right. One of the best swordsmen alive. - Sorry. I'm afraid he met a better one and got himself killed. (dramatic music) - Huh! - Now I must tell you, your brother wasn't all that good at swordsmen, neither are you. Now I don't like the way that you handle women, but typically Chu clan though. - Huh! (objects cluttering) Why don't you come on then? (sword clinks) (sword schwing) (women shrieking) (Wong chuckles) (Lang Lang's screaming) (sword schwing) - [Yen Hsi Su] Hai! (tappings on the log) Haa! - Huh! (Yen Hsi Su's grunting) - Hee yaaa! (Wong chuckles) (Lang Lang shrieks) - Keep your hands off me. (Wong chuckles) - Just being friendly. (Wong crying in pain) (dramatic music) (joints cracking) - Hu ha! - What are you doing? cow tying to me. - Practicing Kung fu. - Who are you? - My name is Wong. I am Wong Chi's brother, heard of him? - So then, you're Wong Pa. - Right, sometimes known as a Turtle. (women chuckles) - Huh, suits you. - Aao! Haa! (Wong laughs) - No antidote for that poison. You're gonna die. (Wong screams) (water splashing) - How you feel? - Lousy. - I think there's a doctor nearby. I'll take you. - Right. - But that poison is a particularly bad one. Deadly. Two hours time, he'd have been dead. So then, he's lucky. Now miss come here. Give him this. (suspense music) That ought to help, stop the pain. and partially neutralize the poison. But you'll still need some medicine, take with water. (coughing) - You, you fool. You are finished. - But what do you mean? - Well that other stuff wasn't deadly at all, just made him feel faint. He would have been all right in a very short time, but that pill of mine was different. And even I, with all the skill that I have, couldn't cure him now. (soft laughing) In fact, he has about one minute to live. (laughing menacingly) (chocking) You didn't sallow it? - So Wong clan are not poisonous, but Chu clan does have an expert and you are that expert. (dramatic music) (footsteps tapping) (grass rustling) You saved me. - You saved me, least I could do. So lets leave at that, we saved each other. Oh, are you hungry? Right, come on, let's eat. - Sit. What's your name? - Name is Lang Lang, Oh, first name is Su, Su Lang Lang. - Su Lang Lang, pretty name that. Suits you too. - You haven't told me what's your name is. - I'm sorry. My name's Liu, my full name is Liu Yi Su. - Oh. - Where are you going? - Well in fact, I don't know. I have no family now, and no hope. So then, I have no idea. Maybe if you didn't mind, just for a while, I could go with you. - Well, I don't know. Could be risky for you. Not a good idea. - I see, you don't want me. - Hey, Shh. (dramatic music) Who are you? - I am Lu Hsiang-Cho. - I am Lu Hsiang-Chu. - They say you killed Yen Hsi and Wong Pa. (swords clinks) - Hey, get back. (sword schwing) (sword clinks) - [Hsiang-Cho] Hsiang-Chu. - Well, I've no doubt that there'll be more. We better be careful. - [Chu] This one-armed man, you traced his background yet? - No. - [Chu] You any idea where he is now? - All we know is that he's still in the country. - [Chu] Send Lu Tao Cha after him. - He's already started. - [Chu] That's good. (upbeat music) - You are Chu's top killer. Lu Tao Cha. - You are right. - Who are you? - Name is Chow Yi To, pleased to help you out. - Well, all right. Why did you help me? You don't know me. - Because Chu's killers are after me too. - You have a grudge against Chu? - Hmm, from way back. - You have any idea where Chu is now? - I've looked for him in every damn province, but I know someone who maybe could help. Perhaps you ought to go and see him. - Who? - He's called King Rat. He knows most things that go on around here. - King rat. - Hmm. - Why don't you ask? - I tried it, wouldn't tell me. Threatened him, he still said no. - Where is he? I'd like to try? - Well, there's a daoist fortune teller. Who might just know that. He may not tell you, too scared, in case he kill him. - Well, I have to try. - Lots of luck. (footsteps tappings) - Oh. (fortune teller laughs) Here's some customers. Well now, shall I tell you a fortune? - Well, that's not why we're here. - Oh. Oh. - Well, what do you want? - A man. - Well, all right then, you give me a clue and I guess who? (suspense music) - The King Rat? - Hmm. (fortune teller laughs) - What do you want with him? - I'm sorry, that's my business. - Oh. (fortune teller laughs) All right. I'll take you there. (footsteps tapping) (mouse squeaking) - [King Rat] There you see, Snake Hook. Guess what? see, that particular technique is called the Snake Hook. - [Man] Yeah, why? - [King Rat] All right, I'll show you. Huh, there, see. (laughing) the mouse, heh? You're watching that. - What do you want else? This is King Rat's town. - [King Rat] Watching, huh? Watch. See. - Ho, you want to talk to King Rat? Hey, you there. - What? - You King Rat? - [King Rat] Yes, I am. - Where is Chu Chiu-Tzu? - Huh, Chu Chiu-Tzu? Well now, telling you is risky. Why do you want him? - Just want to talk - Huh. On what? Huh, speak. - A killing. (dramatic music) Tell me where he is? and I'll reward you well. - Well you know, well let see. Chu Chiu-Tzu, right. Well all right, as you're willing to pay, good. Then meet me at the flower pavilion at midnight. - That's strange. It's way past midnight and still not here. I mean, he did promise. (King Rat's screaming) - You wait here. (dramatic music) (candle holder rattling) (footsteps tapping) (tapping on trunk) (body thudding) (footsteps tapping) - Where's our boss? - Afraid somebody murdered him. - Huh! You did. - Why should I? It was Hung Sing who killed him. (footsteps tapping) Hung is a spy of Chu. Call him out here. (dramatic music) - Don't believe him. He's the one you want, right? Avenge him up. - Unless you want to die, you better back off. - [Man] Go, lets go, hey. - Where's the girl you've taken? - I don't know. - But where is Chu? - I don't know. Huh. (screeching) Don't hit me, I'll tell you. - Go on. - He is at- (Hung screams) (dramatic music) - Chow Yi To, so it's you. - Hmm. it's me. - Well tell me why you killed Hung Sing then? (grass rustling) Talk. - Because I found out that he works for Chu, and because he was the one that killed King Rat. So I decided that it was time that he died. - But where's the girl? - Huh, I see no girl here. - Why do you hate Chu? What's he done? - I fight good. I'm an expert. So five years ago, Chu invited me to work for him as a killer. I refused. So then, he sent his men and killed my whole family. (sad music) See these hands, staining with a blood of 16 of his killers. And one day I'll get my hands on Chu. When I do, I'll suck life out of him. - So we have something in common then, because I want him dead too. - And what is it he did to you? to make you hate him so much. - My father was a loyal minister. And then when General Ho was planning his rebellion, he asked dad to join, but dad refused. Because General Ho then went and hired Chu Chiu-Tzu. Chu had a reputation as a top assassin. Chu took his man, nine of them. And they wiped out most of my family. And all in all, they killed 80 of my relations in one night. - Huh. And how did you lose your arm? - A best friend caught me off my guard, that's all. - So then, from then on you trust no one? Well you have to be good to beat Chu, for he fights damn well. But we could get him together. What do you say? - Oh, no, thanks. I prefer to work alone. - Right. And we'll see who gets to him first? - [Tai] Chow Yi To. (dramatic music) - Who are you? - I'm Tai Li Wa and I am one of Chu's men. He gave me personal orders to kill you. - You! - Come outside, get a clear space. (swords clinks) (sword schwing) - Huh, they made a mistake. They all told me you were good, they were wrong. (swords clinks) - [Chow Yi To] Is that so? I'll make you eat those words. (swords clinks) (Chow's grunting and screaming) - You work for Chu, huh? (Tai chuckles) - But Chow Yi To once helped me out in a fight. So I must avenge him. - All right. Try it. (Tai's wailing) - All right friend. Don't look like that. I don't want to fight. - I feel you're not a good man. - Well, before I was actually born, I was then, but not since. - Who are you? - Your friend. - Don't wanna seem rude, but I don't need any friends right now. - But then you will someday. And the day you do, I'll be there. I should suddenly appear. (bluegrass music) There's the sound of death, and the way you play, seems to me, there is hatred in your heart. But perhaps I'm wrong. Anyway, you're waiting for somebody. - You are nearly right. - Well, I won't bother you. - I think you're looking for someone. - And how did you know that? - I don't think that's important. I simply know. - All right, so tell me then. - The men is at Shenshu Monastery. His name's Monk Hsiao Hua. And he'll tell you anything that you want. You just have to ask him. - But still, why should I trust you? - You don't have much choice, do you? Goodbye. (suspense music) - Thanks. - [Chu] You mean he killed Tai? He actually killed Tai Li Wa? - Yes. - [Chu] Tell me Mo, you know why he's killing all our men like this? - They say that he's a son of minister Liu. - [Chu] That's right. The son of the late minister. They only one of the family to escape. That's why he has to die. - Right. - [Chu] Any idea where he is now? - He said he went Shenshu temple. - [Chu] And where is Tang Han? - Well no, I'm not sure, but he was supposed to be trailing him, waiting for a chance to kill him. - [Chu] Well, I can't wait for that. We have to act now. Pass the word to all our men. I want that one-armed man killed and fast. - Sir. (dramatic music) (bluegrass music) - Well my friend, so you came, I've been waiting quite a while. - Now, let me guess. You must be Fu Pai Su. - You've heard of me. - Sure I am. The man who in one stormy night killed seven top fighters to get his revenge. - You don't carry a sword. - To deal with your kind, I don't need one. My fist will do. - We'll see. (dramatic music) (blade schwing) - Well now, that's a good blade. You use it well. Come on. (blade schwing) (Fu Pai Su screams) (Fu Pai Su's wailing) - I wonder, who's gonna try to avenge you? (footsteps tapping) (folding fan's whooshing) - Oh, the Heroic one, is that right? And you're the Brave one then, is that right? You're the Gentlemen, is that right? Oh, right. The man who won't bow, is that right? - Right. - The Chu clan four killers. - Hey, he recognizes us. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. - Won't bow, huh? (sobbing) Bow! (sobbing) Killers, huh. What a joke, huh. You should be killed before to Chu clan clowns. Don't you agree? (four killers sobbing) - Yes, yes we agree. (funny music) - [Monk] Hey what do you want? - Sorry, got the wrong place. - Which place do you want? - Shen temple. (Monk chuckles) - This is it. - I want Monk Hsiao Hua, is he here? - What's your business? - Someone told me that he could give me some information. - He is gone. - Well, finding you here, I assumed he left. - I am Monk Hsiao Hua. I won't tell you anything but I will kill you. - You're not a monk. - How I am not? - If you are a monk, temple must've changed a lot. - He is a Monk. What's more, he is a man, yet also a girl. Let's say just a little of both. (Monk chuckles) And a friend of mine. - Oh. So then you're a Yang Chi. - Huh, right. One time I was a nun, but then I left the convent. Now I live with him. - But still, why did you send me here? - I couldn't kill you by myself. So I needed some help. And who better than my friend? Simple. - You were wrong. You two can't kill me. - That's what you think, you have too much confidence. You have only one hand, between us we got both, right? - Huh! Don't look, I am shy. - You disgusting creature, huh. (sword clinks) (Yang screams) - Yang Chi! - Now where is Chu? Talk. - Don't know. (Monk screams) (dramatic music) (footsteps tapping) - You again? Why are you always hanging around? - Well, that simple, because I'm your friend. - I've told you, you're not. - If I were to tell you where you could find your enemies, would you change your mind and take me as your friend? - Sure, in that case, I would. - Then I'm your friend. To celebrate, let's drink. - All right. (dramatic music) - Three years ago, Chu was hired to kill your family and he did it. Not alone, he took nine of his best men. - Who were they? - Mung Sing Hung, Lo Hsiang Pu, Liu Yan, Yen Hsi Su, Yiu Wa, Chu Lu, Fu Pai Su, Mo Fei To and one more. - And just who was this other one? What's his name? He is Tang Han. He didn't want to go, but Chu made him. - Matter of fact, I've killed five of them, you know? - Sure, there's still Chu Lu, Mo Fei To, Liu Yan and Tang Han, just four. Would you like to know where they are? - Yes, I would. - Mo Fei To stays in the camp. And Chu Lu in the brothels. Liu Yan lives alone. And Tang, I'm afraid I don't know. - Oh. - I think you kill Chu Lu first, and then go to Chiang Saen to get Liu Yan. After you get them, I wait for you in Pai Si Po. And tell you the next one you want to kill. - Do you know which brothel Chu Lu goes to? - Springhouse, quite early tonight. He'll be there. (joyful music) (indistinct talking in background) - Good night, come again. Thank you, sir. Thank you, come again. (man chuckles) - [Chu Lu] Taha di. - Huh! Oh sir! Oh it's you sir. Welcome Mr. Chu. Please come in. (women giggles) - Hey, Mr. Chu is here. - Oh that's nice, I will pay for her. - Well all right, enjoy yourself. Well, come in you're here. What's your plan? - Same as usual, I want plenty of girls, at least four or five. - Huh, that's what I like to see, a wealthy man and big ideas. (everybody laughs) Please come in Mr. Chu. - I am new here, never been before. The one girl is enough for me. So pick a girl and anyone will do for me. - A client Su Wa. - Well I noticed you've only one arm. Too bad. With two, you handle more. - Well go on, entertain our guest. - [Woman] Sure. - Oh Aba, look after your client now, huh. - Sure. Please sir, come with me. - Back to the door. - Yes ma'am. - This way. Come on, don't stare like that. Come in, come inside. It's much more interesting there, come up. (door creaking) (tea sloshing) Well come on, let's undress. - No, thank you, I'm on business. - Sure. I mean, we're both on business, but to do it, we have to undress. - Well, when I said business, I didn't mean that. - Well you can call it what you want. As for me, I call it fun. Now let's not waste time. (dramatic music) - Right, get undressed. - Sure. (objects cluttering) (women screams) (door creaking) (indistinct talking) - [Chu] Looking for me? (wooden thudding) - Seems you finished your business. Well now, that didn't take too long. - Hmm. Well it seems, she's failed. I guess she's dead. And now you've come here for me, is that right? - Right. I've come to take your life. - Do you really think you can? with only one arm? - I never waste my strength in bed. (footsteps tapping) (women screaming) - Hey. - I want Mr. Liu, is he home? - You are swordsmen? - No, I'm just a traveler. - You got business with him? - Of course, sure I have. Take me. (footsteps tapping) (door creaking) - Master, a visitor. - Well, you must be the one who escaped us. It's a pity, we missed you. - You still remember the affair. And now you have retired and live up here. (Liu laughing) - You come for a talk or to kill me. - I've come here to kill you. (Liu laughing) - Well I retired from fighting, but since you insist, I guess that I'll need my sword again. - Sir. Bring the sword. - I must admit, that's long. How long? - Six feet. - Width? - About 12 inches. - Well Mr. Liu, that's a great sword you have there. (Man laughing) - Sure it is. It's the best and there's none better, for sure. (Liu laughing) - And in a very short time, you are gonna find out how great it is. (sword break clinking) - Size of sword doesn't matter. (sword clinks) (sword schwing) I should let you use two more blades. (sword clinks) After that no more chances, then I shall kill you. - Haa! - What really counts, isn't the sword, only the man, in every case. - Master, you love swords, but finally your own sword kills you. - Very good. So you killed another two of them. - Of the nine, I've now killed seven. Now it's time for one other. - Who? - Tang Han. - You can kill any of the others, but you can't kill him. - It seems I was right, you must be Tang Han. - Yes, you're right. I am Tang Han. You'll kill me, huh? - That's what I said. - But you won't, if you do, you'll never find Chu. (Tang Han laughs softly) - How do I know that you'll tell me? - I'm finished with Chu. - I doubt it. - And why is that? - Well, because it makes no sense. For a killer to work for the Chu, is a real honor and a well-paid honor, they all get rich. You're with them. So why give up your chance? - You're right. As a killer, it's good to work for him, pays better than anything else. But Chu was real unfair to me. He always favored Fu Pai Su or else, it was Mr. Liu. I never got the good jobs. Always, I got the crap. I know that he despises me, and what's more, he doesn't trust his men. He never tells them a thing, unless he has to. So if you were me, I tell you you'll betray him. Want's more? There's something else. - What would that be? - Well once you've got rid of Chu and other two, then all the leaders will be dead and I'll take control and you forget me. Do you agree? - Oh, so that's the reason you've been helping me. I see you want to take the leadership. - Of course I've planned it for a long time. I didn't help you for nothing. Well, that's fair. - Right, I'll forget the past, but now where can I find the girl? - Well, she's being kept prisoner by Sao Si Yi. I'll take you there, and that ought approved you that I really am on your side. - [Chu] You are sure that Tang hand is turn traitor? - Yes I am. - [Chu] He's a very smart man. But I'm afraid this time has been a bit too smart. Mo Fei To - Sir. - [Chu] I'm sure Tang's next step will be to take the one-armed man to Sao Si Yi, you know what to do. - Go to him and kill him. (flute tuning) - Tang Han, they are waiting for you. You betrayed the clan. (flute tuning) - I'm sorry, we all have our price. - And so you're the one who killed my brother, is that right? - Yes I did. - Where you got the girl? - Well if you can beat me, you're gonna have the girl. But if you can't, then you'll be dead. (weapons clinks together) - It seems you need a few music lessons. (weapons clinks together) - Well, that's one more gone. - Where's the girl? - Come with me. There. - I know you'd come, thank you. - That's all right. Now you take me to Chu. - Hmm. Wait. You shouldn't take her. - Me, why not? - Because it's much too dangerous. Chu's tough, make no mistake. - Tang Han, you had that coming to you. - You must be Mo Fei To? - Yeah, that's right. And when I throw, I never miss. - That may be, but the fact is you've got no knives left now, have you? - We'll see. (Mo screeching) - Tell me where to find Chu? - If I tell you, you spare me, let me go. - Tell me. - At south mountain, by the White Buddha. You, you let me go. - Is that the truth? - Yes, yes, he says. It, it's true. Now please spare my life, please spare me. - You killed my family. You spared no one. You must die. (Mo screams) (water splashing) - Go back to the hotel. I'm going for Chu. Wait there. - All right. - Hey, you can't come in here. - Chu Chiu-Tzu, come on out. (suspense music) Chu Chiu-Tzu, come out. Chow Yi To, it's you. - Right. - So then you're alive. - That man that you saw being killed, was the substitute who was hiding there. - Why did you kill Lu Tao Cha? - Well, now I had no idea why you were after me. So I simply killed him in order to get your trust. After that, you told me why you wanted to kill me. - So then that story you told me, it was a lie. - Well, of course. I'm a very good liar. And you believed every word. - You sneaky bastard. (Chu laughing) - A killer has got to be sneaky, otherwise he won't survive. You mean to kill me? - No, I don't. You're not Chu. Why should I kill you? - But I am Chu. - Well Chu has only nine fingers and you have 10. - So you can't be Chu. Chu Chiu-Tzu, come out. - An attack from behind, eh? I expected better. - I'm good at it. Must kill you or you'll kill me, but I'll cut you nine times first. (sword schwing) - I understand, that's one cut for every man that I killed. So you are Chu then. - Of course, you were wrong. I have nine toes, not nine fingers. (dramatic music) You killed all of my men, my best fighters. I promise you this, you'll suffer now. - You evil bastard. You are not fit to live. - You still talking tough. Damn it! you're dead. - I promise you'll die before me. - You! (sword schwing) I got one, for Mo Fei To. (sword schwing) (Liu screams) And that one for Tai Li Wa. Tai Li Wa was my real son. - That's so? That figures, Tai Li Wa was a bastard too. - It's time I stopped your mouth. Oh! you have no arm now, so how does it feel then? (Chu laughing) You're not just one-armed now, you're armless. Not a damn thing you can do. (Chu laughing) (spitting) (Chu grunting) You, you, damn you. You have two arms all along. Ahh! - Chu Chiu-Tzu, you're finished. You've wounded me and took my arm, but you've paid for that with your life. - God damn you, may, may you- - Well, it seems you really are one armed now. (Liu screams) (Lang Lang screams) - Why? why would you do that? Try to kill me. - Well, Lo Pu was my father. Remember the chess game? I realized on the road, could have killed you, but then I just couldn't do it. Because you had to get your revenge first. - Lo Pu, I didn't kill him. - He died because of you. You disgraced him. Killed himself, when you left. So then, as his daughter, I have to get revenge. But listen, please tell me what's your real name? - My name is Liu Ching Wu. (upbeat music)
