Grab a bucket, fuzz, I'll help you! Hey! Wait a minute! Can't a man burn a pan of biscuits without getting himself drowned? Biscuits? I thought the house was on fire! How can you think without a brain? I'm sorry I was a little hasty with the water, but your letter said that you were in trouble-- I thought they were trying to burn you out! Some people are so dumb they can't tell the difference between a house on fire and a pan of burnt biscuits. You can't hold it against a man just because he doesn't know any better. I guess that's why I wasted so much time getting you out of trouble-- trouble no intelligent person would have ever gotten into. Okay, what is it this time? It ain't no fault of mine. Sit down, I'll tell you. I own a valuable water right, and there's a lot of good farmland on my ranch. So I got the idea of selling off this farmland to families who want to move in and make homes for themselves. I admire you feeling that way, but how does that spell trouble? Well, McAllister owns a big outfit, and he wants everything in sight. He wants my water right, and he's dead set against having any settlers locate in the valley. So what? Tell him you don't want to sell him your water right, and what you do is none of his business. I know, but... Somethin' always happens to folks that talk to McAllister that way. Well, you go right ahead with your plans, he can't scare US. You're mighty reckless with my life. Come on, help me get this place cleaned up. I won't be living like this much longer. I'm gettin' married. ( Plate breaking ) You're what?! Why not? I've got a right to get married, ain't I? Sure. Sure, but where you gonna find a woman crazy enough to marry an old goat like you? Ha! That's what you think. Listen to this. "Dear fuzzy, my big, gorgeous man--" and she means me-- "I am sure you are the answer to my maiden's prayer..." Do you mean to tell me that any woman would pray for anything like you? Well, that's what she says, right here in the letter. Yeah? Where'd you meet her? I ain't met her yet, but, ah, I told her what I was like. You haven't even met the lady? No, but she told me what she's like. See, I joined the lonesome heart matrimonial club, and that's how come we started writin' each other. Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Oh, fuzz. Go ahead and laugh yer fool head off. Fuzzy: She's comin' out here to marry me, and we're gonna have our own little love nest. She signs herself, here... "Your devoted Matilda boggs." Fuzz, you've got your neck out a mile. You've never even seen this lady. If she's taking as much Liberty in describing herself as you must have, you don't know what kind of a package you'll get. You don't seem to understand that I mean what I say. You need some educatin'. That seems to be the end of the first lesson, drop by when you can give US another. You'll get to last you the rest of your life-- which won't be long. Come on. That's Jim McAllister. Yeah? Nice neighbor. If I had my choice between him and a rattlesnake, I'd take the snake. Why don't you put that thing away. Haven't you got enough trouble without going romantic? It ain't no trouble, it's easy. Easy? I write to her, she writes to me, we get married. What's your next move, boss? I don't know yet. Who is that other fella? I never saw him before. I've heard fuzzy Jones speak about his friend Billy Carson-- that could be him. Whoever he is, he'll wish he hadn't horned in to this party. Yeah. I may be wrong, but I'd be willing to bet fuzzy Jones has been rustling my cattle. I sent one of my boys over to scout his ranch. Howdy. Howdy. I hear you're selling some farmland. You don't look like no farmer to me. Do I have to look like a farmer before I can buy a farm? Well, I guess not, we're not running a beauty contest. There's a piece of property over here I'd like to talk to you about. Let's have a look. Well, this is what I was tellin' you about. You want to buy this land to farm? If I'm crazy enough to buy it, you shouldn't worry. Somethin' fishy about it. ( Gunshot ) He's dead, shot through the heart. And that's the murderer. I didn't shoot him, it was someone else. You expect US to believe that? There's his gun, sheriff. He was one of my best boys, the one I said was scouting this range. There's been one shot fired from that gun. I ain't fired no shot! How do you explain a spent shell? Let's take him in, sheriff. I'll send someone for his body. Get on that horse. Sheriff, somebody else fired that shot, you gotta look around-- get on that horse before I bend this over your head! All right, you can come to life now. Well, it's about time, I've been lying with ants. They sure went for that ketchup on my shirt. Ha ha ha! You're a pretty good actor, I like to knock myself out watching you die. It ain't funny to me. I gotta play dead till they hang that guy. Let's get out of here. Hey, fuzz... What's wrong? Plenty. I was just talkin' to a fella, and boom! Somebody shot him. Yeah? Who fired the shot? I don't know. The sheriff and McAllister happened along just then, and they claim I done it. Funny they just happened along at that time. Seems like McAllister's having the sheriff play his game. You watch your step, young feller. I don't like that kind of talk-- get in there. Be smart-- hit the road. You'll do yourself no good hanging around this valley. Maybe I can give you an argument on that. I don't argue-- when I say something, that's it. Fuzzy: Billy! What am I gonna do? I didn't kill that fella, but they'll hang me for it, sure as I'm a foot high. Don't worry, I'll get you out of this somehow. Even if they don't hang me, my rights will go to pot while they got me locked up in here. Don't worry about a thing, I'll look after everything. Hee-yah! Do you suppose that's miss Matilda boggs? Golly gee, I wouldn't want her to know I'm in jail. If is is, fuzz, I'll cover up for you. Don't forget she's my girl. I beg your pardon, are you miss Matilda boggs? Fuzzy! Oh, you great, big, wonderful man! I beg your pardon, miss, but I'm not fuzzy Jones. You're not? No ma'am. What a pity. Where is my fuzzy? Well, you might say that he's all wrapped up in some important business. You might even call it a matter of life and death. I see. I'd better run you out to fuzzy's place. You can make your home there, and when fuzzy gets back, you two can get on with your wedding. Anything you say is all right with me... And I mean all right. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I do hope you'll be able to spare a little time, to keep me from feeling lonely till fuzzy returns. I'll get the buckboard. Hey, sheriff! I gotta get out of here, you can't do this to me! Shut yer trap before I come in there and shut it for ya. But I gotta get out, it's important! Maybe the man you killed felt it was important to keep on livin'. Aw, I didn't kill nobody. Shut up. Hey, sheriff! Sheriff! Hey! Hello, sheriff! Hello! Hello! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! What's the matter with you?! My stomach's poisoned! ( Fuzzy ranting ) Let me outta here! Come back here! I'll break every bone in yer body! Fuzzy's a luck man, you're a fine cook. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Yeah, that was a great meal. Well, I guess I'd better be moseying along. Don't be in a hurry-- have another cup of coffee. I just saw a horrible-looking face peeking in the window. Yeah? Act as if nothing's happened. Wow, that's hot! I guess we'd better let it cool off. Fuzz! What are you doing here? Uh, don't you remember? I live here. I know that, but I thought that you were-- are you fuzzy Jones? Yes'm, ma'am, that's me, fuzzy q. Jones, and I'm awfully sorry I wasn't on hand when you arrived. Let me get this straight. Was that, uh, business of yours all taken care of? Not exactly, I sort of left it unfinished. That may have been a mistake. I'm not stupid-- what's this double-talk all about? I have a right to know what I'm walking into. Uh, yes, ma'am, I guess you have. They're trying to hang fuzzy for a murder he didn't commit. Who do you mean by "they"? I don't know for sure, but I'll gamble that Jim McAllister has a finger in the pie. Who is Jim McAllister? He's somethin' that oughtta have been buried a long time ago. He thinks he can run the valley and make me sell out whether I want to or not. I see. We should stop by and take a look at the Jones place. He wouldn't be fool enough to hide out at home. I don't know about that-- I hear a good lookin' gal was askin' for him this morning. That might be worth lookin' into. That might be just the thing that'd keep him hanging around. Fuzz, you can't be hanging around here. The sheriff'll be turning over every rock looking for you. You seem to be might anxious to get rid of me. Don't be foolish. I'd be glad to see you stay out of jail. Is that what I came out here to marry? Well, he's not very good lookin', miss, and he isn't over-educated, but he's got a heart of gold. What's the cash value of a heart of gold? Ha ha! I like a gal with a sense of humor. Don't you worry, I'll get out of this and we'll have our little love nest. Fuzz, there's the sheriff! Get going, quick! No, take my horse, he's fresh. Go on! ( Banging on door ) Let me do the talkin'. Yeah, what do you want? We're lookin' for fuzzy Jones. He's not here. We'll make sure of that. He's gettin' away! We had fun, didn't we? It won't be fun from here on out. If you're smart, you'll get out of this valley. I hope fuzzy makes it-- I think he will. Was that McAllister? Yeah, that's him. Plays kinda rough. Looks like we've lost him. Not for long. Nice lookin' girl back there. Yeah. You and fuzzy are pretty good friends, aren't you? Yes, ma'am, the best. He's no beauty, but he's all right. You could do a lot worse than tie up with old fuzz. I'm not looking for the worst. I guess I better stick around, keep an eye on the place till fuzzy gets back. I can bunk out there in the barn. I'll be glad to have you nearby. I feel nervous here all alone. You've got nothing to worry about-- good night. Good night. ( Whistles ) ( Whistles again ) ( Whistles ) Hey, Billy! Over here! Boy, am I glad to see you-- did you bring me something to eat? Sure, fuzz, help yourself. Where's my horse? Over there by the rocks. Back up, you're in my lunch bucket. Fuzz, you better stay put up here in the hills. McAllister knows the truth about that killing-- I'll get it out of him somehow. ( Mumbling ) Eat or talk-- don't try to do 'em both at the same time. But I'm yearning for Matilda. You are, huh? Well, she'll keep. You have no time for romance until you get your neck out of danger. ( Gunshot ) You work for McAllister-- I want some information. I'm ain't tellin' ya nothin'. You'll tell me how McAllister framed fuzzy or I'll beat your head off. Start talkin'! I don't know anything about it! Maybe this'll help. What's goin' on here? I found fuzzy Jones and he helped him get away. Tryin' hard to get yourself into trouble. But he isn't guilty. We'll let the courts decide that. You ain't careful, you'll find yourself in jail with him. Get your horse, well try and catch up with him. I'm getting sick and tired of hiding out in here, waiting till they catch that guy and hang him. No telling how long it'll be. A guy might just as well be in jail. What are you kicking about? You're getting paid for doing nothing. Maybe so, but it gets pretty monotonous. I wish you'd picked out somebody else to get killed. Oh, boss. We got company. And she's pretty, too. Keep out of sight. This is a fine time to ask a guy to play dead. You won't be playing if you don't do what I say. ( Knocking ) Come in. Are you Mr. McAllister? At your service. I'm Matilda boggs. You don't look like the kind of girl whose name would be Matilda boggs. That's my real name-- I use a different one on stage. It begins to make sense. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Why did you come here? I've an idea we can be of some help to each other. In what way? You want fuzzy's ranch, I want money. You're plenty cold-blooded about it. You have to be cold-blooded or be a sucker. I'm always willing to pay for what I want--plenty. You came out here to marry him? Sure, and that was a good joke on me. I got fed up with the life of an actress and thought i'd grab me a husband and settle down. I wouldn't marry any of the trash I met hanging around the theater, so I fell for an ad in the matrimonial paper. He made it sound pretty-- wonderful ranch, a big, handsome husband just oozing love and devotion. He really gave you a song and dance. You know what I got. He double-crossed me, and I don't feel like coming out here just for the ride. I think we can do business. When we catch fuzzy, he'll be hung for murder. You've got to figure some way to marry him, and then turn him over to the sheriff. I think that can be managed. As his widow, you'll own the property. Then we'll make a deal. I'll be seeing you. Keep away from here until you're a widow. Don't want Carson to get suspicious. Carson is my idea of what I thought fuzzy would be. But don't worry-- I never let sentiment interfere with business. Bye. Goodbye. Oh, boy. Ain't she a knockout? Whew! You dumb idiot! When I tell you to keep out of sight, I mean it! She might be on the level, but I'm not taking any chances. She might have come over here just to spy on US. ( Knocking ) Hello. ( Disappointed: ) Hello. Yes? Hi. I saw you over at Jim McAllister's. I thought I'd like to get a little bit better acquainted. Well, i-I'm busy now, maybe some other time. Your crazy for coming back here, and I was a fool to bring you that note. When Matilda sends for me, I'll go through fire and water. You're liable to get your whiskers singed and your feet wet. Stay here until I see whether the coast is clear. I heard you were looking for a high-class husband, and you and I could buy a pretty swell little ranch with the money we're gonna get off of Jim. And wasn't it wonderful that you just happen to be available. Yeah. It's Carson, he mustn't see you here. Go out that way. Where's fuzzy? Couldn't you find him? Yeah, I found him. I don't like the idea of him coming back here. I didn't hear anyone ask your opinion. Billy, I seen a ghost! The man they said I killed, I seen him just as plain as I see you! Don't be silly, you-- you didn't see any ghost... Who was here, Matilda? There was no one here, he must have seen a ghost. He must have seen a ghost, eh? I'd like to run into that ghost. I'm goin' out and see if I can find him. I can stand up to anything human, but that ghost scared the pants off of me. You've got something more important than a ghost to worry about. Yeah, what? Your friend, Billy. What about Billy? He doesn't want me to marry you. You mean-- I hate to say anything about your friend, but I think we should get married right away. Fine friend he turned out to be. I never thought he'd cut the ground out from under my feet. I couldn't find him-- he got away. Something else has been bothering me, Matilda. What were you doing at the McAllister ranch? I was never there. No? I saw you riding from that direction. That doesn't mean anything. You've gone far enough, I won't have you doubting Matilda's word! And I never thought you'd pull a dirty trick on me. Are you crazy? I may have been, but I'm not now. Get goin'. Maybe you know what he's talking about. You know as well as I do. ( Knocking ) Hello, judge. Hello, Billy. What are you doing out here? I got a message from miss boggs asking me to come. Said it was very important. Who delivered the message? Ned Cassidy-- McAllister's foreman. He was just a passing cowboy-- I didn't know who he was. Fuzzy and I want you to marry US. Don't you know that fuzzy's an outlaw? That doesn't make any difference to me. Hi, judge. You're supposed to be in jail. I know, but I'm thinking on getting married-- that's the same as being in jail. Ha ha! Ha ha! Stop dilly-dallying around and start the marriage, I ain't got long to linger around here. All right, I ain't had a marryin' job in a long time. I hope the sheriff don't interrupt the ceremony. Grab her hand. Now, fuzz, don't you be in a hurry. You won't stand for that, will you? Yer darn tootin', I won't. You're not welcome here-- get out and stay out! Fuzz, I really hate to do this. I'm sorry, judge, but there's too many lies tied up with this marriage. I'm gonna get the straight of it before it goes any further. You won't get away with this strong-arm stuff. You can't stop me from marrying fuzzy, and I'll make you sorry you ever tried. Why don't you try to be a nice girl? Both of you sit down-- I'm gonna make sure you stay put for a while. Over there. I can keep you from getting hung, but I can't keep you from making a fool of yourself. So I guess jail's the only safe place for you. Well, welcome home. I'll get even with you for this, Billy Carson. You'll thank me for it someday, fuzz. Go on, get in there. The sheriff got fuzzy, I saw 'em at the jail. Good. The plan must have worked out all right. I'll start the ball rolling. I'm glad the sheriff caught that murderer. Ed slane was a good boy. Fuzzy Jones murdered him in cold blood. I'm in favor of seeing that he doesn't get away again. ( Crowd murmurs agreement ) Sheriff: I'll bet you stay put this time. Billy: You're so stubborn, you won't listen to reason. Why didn't you just take a shot at me? Then I wouldn't have to stand around thinking about you doing this to me. You've got it all wrong. I'm just trying to stop you from making a foolish mistake. Something's wrong about you being rushed into that marriage, this was the only way I could stop it. Don't tell me them lies. Go away and leave me alone. I'm sorry you feel that way... Maybe some day you'll understand. No one's more in favor of law and order than I am, even a murderer is entitled to a fair trial. But when you got a sheriff that can't keep him in jail, something should be done. If he breaks out again, we may never get him! Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Best break I ever had in my life. And that dumb cowboy has to come along and throw in a monkey wrench. Well, he won't stop me from cashing in, and I'll make him sorry he ever tried. Must be disappointin' to have a wedding end like this. Don't just sit there-- try to get free and help me. Why wear myself out getting nowhere? The only thing that's bothering me is this pesky fly that wants to sit on my nose. I wouldn't mind if he just set, but he wants to keep walking around all the time. Up on your feet! Say... From fuzzy's description, you look like the man he supposedly killed. Suppose I am a-- oh, you don't know what you're talking about. No? You're the livest-looking corpse I ever saw. What do you mean? You heard what I said. You're out of your mind. Suppose I am. Let's take a ride to town and let fuzzy have a look. I'm not going anyplace with you, and the best thing you can do is get off of this ranch! Ed wasn't killed in a fight, he was murdered. I suspected that fuzzy Jones was rustling my cattle, so I sent ed over to investigate. That was the last time I ever saw him alive. Ed was a friend of mine, and I'm gonna see to it that his murderer gets what's comin' to him. All: Yeah! Have you changed your mind about a trip to town? You'll with you never got mixed up in this. You could be wrong-- get on your horse! Whoa, sheriff! Oh! Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff! What do you want? Give me a gun, we're gonna have trouble. I ain't fallin' for no more of your tricks. Just look out in the street! Oh... Hey, sheriff! That's far enough! Man: Be smart, sheriff, nobody wants to hurt you. Somebody'll get hurt if you try to take a prisoner out of my jail. You let that murderer escape once before-- we're making sure it don't happen again. There'll be no mob law in this town while I'm sheriff. He'll get a fair trial, and if he's found guilty, he'll hang. Some of you people down in that crowd I call my friends, but I'll blast the first one that tries to rush this door. Be smart--I'm tellin' ya in the name of the law, go on about your business. Some of you men take care of him, the rest of you, come with me! Take him out! So help me, I'll never talk to you again! Come on, men! Get down off that horse. Say, that's the fella they said I killed. He ain't much alive, and he ain't dead, either. Fuzz, there's your ghost. Untie the sheriff. Sheriff, lock these two men up. I'll think of some charge to bring against 'em. McAllister framed this thing to get fuzzy hung for murder. McAllister did that to me? That's right. Stand back, boys-- he's my meat. Sheriff: Get in there, you two. Well, that's the end of fuzzy Jones. Nice of everybody to be so obliging. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be-- I came here to pay you off. ( All laughing ) You all right? Hold it! Next time you want to hang somebody, be sure you know what you're doing. Now belly up to the bar, the drinks are on me. ( All cheering ) Billy, i-i... I know what you're trying to say. Forget it. Hey, that-that's Matilda. Matilda! Where you going? Home. You're not gonna leave me flat? That's not a bad idea. Hee-yah! That's what I call' leavin' him flat. Captioned by captioneering your closed captioning resource
