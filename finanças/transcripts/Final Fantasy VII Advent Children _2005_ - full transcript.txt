To those who loved this world and knew friendly company therein: This Reunion is for you. [♪♪♪] [ROARS] 498 Years Earlier [ELEVATOR WHIRRING] KADAJ: Why does humankind even bother? You wreck everything you've ever made, then you start over like it'll be any different the next time. SHINRA: I suppose we're no good at facing our memories. We'd rather gild the past, find something worthwhile among the rubble and build a future with that. KADAJ: And that's why you salvaged Mother? To "gild the past"? SHINRA: We were trying to rid ourselves of a more immediate problem. You can't mean the stigma? But you're the ones who brought that on yourselves in the first place. Well, now. I guess you really do have a short memory. Hm. No. Not me. You see, it is my choice to forget. [WIND WHISTLING] Two Weeks Earlier ELENA [OVER RADIO]: Tseng! Look at this. TSENG [OVER RADIO]: Hm. Pay dirt. ELENA: Not a pretty sight, is it? Who cares? Just get the damn thing. TSENG: Reno, the chopper. You got it. [GUNFIRE] RENO: Whoa, whoa, whoa! ELENA: Reno, hurry! Reno! RENO: Who the hell is that?! [ELENA GRUNTS] RENO: Elena! ELENA: Get out! [RENO PANTING] [BOTH GRUNTING] RENO: Damn it. [STATIC CRACKLING] [RADIO CUTS OFF] [♪♪♪] MARLENE: The Lifestream. That's what we call the river of life that circles our planet, giving life to the world and everything in it. The Shinra Electric Power Company discovered a way to use the Lifestream as an energy source. Because of Shinra's energy, we were able to live very comfortable lives. But wasn't that because we were taking away from the planet's life? A lot of people thought so. Shinra used their power to try and stop anybody who got in their way. Shinra had a special group of warriors called SOLDIER. And all of the SOLDIERs had Jenova cells put inside them. Jenova was a calamity that fell from the sky a long, long time ago and tried to destroy the planet. Anyway, there was one SOLDIER named Sephiroth who was better than the rest. But when he found out about the terrible experiments that made him, he began to hate Shinra. And then, over time, he began to hate everything. Shinra and the people against them. Sephiroth, who hated the planet so much, he wanted to make it go away. And the people who tried to stop him. There were a lot of battles. For every battle, there was more sadness. Someone I love went back to the Lifestream too. And then, it came. The chosen day. In the end, the planet itself had to make the battles stop for good. The planet used the Lifestream as a weapon, and when it burst out of the earth, all the fighting, all the greed and sadness, everything was washed away. "Sadness was the price to see it end." It's been two years since they told me that. [CAR HORNS HONKING] [CROWD CHATTERING] [ALL GASP] [GROANING] Hey, let's go. Okay. MAN: Watch it! [♪♪♪] [MAN GRUNTING] But it looks like the planet is a lot madder than we thought. They call it geostigma. Well, Marlene? How does it look? Please. Please don't take Denzel away. MAN [ON RADIO]: The commission's report released this morning has revealed that Lifestream concentration in the atmosphere has dropped to a mere hundredth of the levels two years ago and now poses no threat to the human body. [PHONE RINGING] However, the concentration remains toxic... He's not here anymore. Around the Shinra Company's main building and mako reactors. To prevent the onset of geostigma, the commission does advise that you stay away from these facilities and the surrounding areas. Next up: Should Shinra be held financially responsible for the crisis? [PHONE RINGING] DENZEL: Cloud, where are you? Hello, Strife Delivery Service. You name it, we deliv... May I ask who's calling? [GIGGLES] Yeah, I remember you. [VOICEMAIL BEEPS] TIFA: You got a call from Reno. He's in Healen. Says he's got work for you. Cloud, how have you been? ELECTRONIC VOICE: You have no more messa... [♪♪♪] Hey, Kadaj? Is that where Big Brother lives? Yeah. Do you think he'll be glad to see us? Not a chance. Don't cry, Yazoo. But Mother's with him? Maybe not. Don't cry, Loz. [CRIES] Hold on, he's coming. Hm. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] [GROWLING] [SCREECHING] Where's Mother? We know you hid her, Brother. KADAJ: Don't tell me you're leading me on? Because I think you do have Mother there. No need to shout. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Put the president on. [GRUNTS] Hm. [GASPS] [CHUCKLES] Hm. [SCOFFS] Guess I was the last straw. [VOICEMAIL BEEPS] BARRET: What up, fool, it's Barret! I am the man! Oil, Cloud! I just found the biggest damned oil field you ever seen! Surveying's done, so I should be able to get out there and see Marlene soon. You let her know, all right, Spiky? [VOICEMAIL BEEPS] TIFA: Reno called again. He says to hurry, and he sounded kind of strange... Be careful, okay? [GRUNTING] Okay, so you're good. Yeah, Rude, looking sharp! Mmm. SHINRA: Good. You fight like the SOLDIER you once claimed to be. [♪♪♪] You haven't lost your touch. [SIREN WAILING] Rufus Shinra? Do I feel sorry for you. [CLEARS THROAT] The day of the explosion, What do you want? I managed to get out Who were the guys that attacked me? Before it colla... I'm leaving. We need your assistance, Cloud. Not interes... I acknowledge that Shinra owes the planet a lot. It goes without saying that my company and I are the ones who put the world in the sorry state it's in. Therefore, it's our responsibility to set things right. RENO: I'm still out here...? As a first step, we have commenced an investigation in Sephiroth's wake. It's been two years. Now that the world is on its feet again, what poses the greatest threat? Well, that one's easy: Geostigma. And we have reason to think Sephiroth is the one responsible. The populace, they blame mako energy, and the reactors, even the Lifestream for causing the stigma. However, isn't that blame misplaced? The Lifestream has existed as long as the planet, and even mako energy has been part of our lives for over 40 years. And yet, there's no mention of the stigma in recorded history. So, what happened during our time to change all that? I can think of only one thing. The arrival of Sephiroth. Sephiroth is dead. Yes, but has his mind died? What if he somehow dissolved into the Lifestream, coursing through the planet undiffused? I know it is merely my speculation, but it is possible, isn't it? And we can't cure the stigma until we know the truth. So we took action. We went to look for traces of Sephiroth. We started... Do you know where? RENO: Yup, at the Northern Cave! SHINRA: And what do you think we found? Relax. We didn't find anything. However, not all went as planned. We were interrupted. ELENA: Get out! SHINRA: Kadaj and his gang. CLOUD: Kadaj? SHINRA: They'll be after you as well. If they haven't already found you. CLOUD: Leave me out of this. Don't think you can keep her from us for long. How? Your ties to Sephiroth run as deep as ours do, Cloud. If Kadaj's purpose is to do what's necessary to prepare for the moment, we stand in the way as his greatest threat. "Moment"? Sephiroth... reborn. Are you done talking? Let's get to the issue at hand. In order to combat Kadaj, we need someone with your expertise. Will you join us? You're an ex-SOLDIER, Cloud. That was only in my head. What's this stuff about "Mother"? Why, did Kadaj mention something? Rufus, if you're hiding something... I'd never keep a secret, not from a comrade. [SCOFFS] You must want to learn all you can about the stigma? Naturally, for the sake of those orphans you live with. Surely, you long to see the smiles return to their faces? All we want in the end is to rebuild our world, Cloud. But l... Come on, Cloud. Think about it. Together we could rebuild Shinra! Not interested. RUDE: Reno! SHINRA: Reno! [GIGGLES] [♪♪♪] Does Cloud live here? I guess he does. What's this? It's just like Denzel! Is Cloud sick? Why didn't he say something? Did he leave because he's sick? He just wants to fight alone. Fight? No. I don't think that he will. Tifa? Let's go home, Marlene. We can't! Cloud's not here yet! I know, sweetie. I miss him too. Yeah. So say he comes back? We'll all go home! Not until he gets a lecture. Uh-huh! Now we just gotta find Elena and the director. The employees give you any leads? No. Nothing yet. [RENO SIGHS] Who'd have thought? A lot of Shinra's people actually returned to work! Now that's dedication. I'm telling you, this could be a fresh start! Well, those left alive have a lot to atone for. Two years already. Mm. Seems like a lot longer than that. What a nightmare, huh? The world was nearly obliterated, and we were the obliterators. Seriously, though. How are we ever supposed to atone for that? Too bad the director's not around, you know? Elena too. Hope they're alive. They are. Tseng's just like the president. They're kind of like cats. Nine lives, you know. You got that right! [WHOOSHING] KADAJ: Found you. [PHONE RINGING] Church? Oh, I know the one. Mm-hm. I'll be here. [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [DIALING] [LINE RINGING] OPERATOR: Your call to Sector 7 cannot be completed at this time. [KEYPAD BEEPS] [GRUNTS] [LINE RINGING] [LINE CONNECTS] [GASPS] [RINGING] [KEYPAD BEEPS] TIFA: Cloud, what a surprise. You never call. Is something wrong? Uh... Cloud? No, ma'am. Well, who, then? Why do you have Cloud's phone? I don't know. Who is this? I don't know. Please... I don't know what to do. I can't do this. [DENZEL CRYING] Hey, are you crying? [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] Hello? Are you okay?! Cloud, if you're there, pick up! CLOUD: Hey! You okay? [GROANS] [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING] [PEOPLE GRUNTING] [CHUCKLES] [BOTH GROANING] [♪♪♪] KADAJ: Boy, do I hate liars. I apologize. This time you'll get the truth. The object you seek fell from the helicopter while we were running from you. I'm afraid we were careless. Is that right? I swear it. Fine. Then swear on these. Why did you do this? We need Mother's power. The Reunion is coming and we need her. Reunion? My brothers and sisters who share Mother's cells will all assemble. And together we'll take revenge on the planet. We've already sent out the invitations, but you know. Someone's gone and hidden the guest of honor. Invitations? The stigma. But you know all about that, sir. Mother's memetic legacy lives on in the Lifestream and makes it happen. She does so much for us, and we... We don't even know where to find her. But what can we do, we're just Remnants. Merely remnants of Mother's legacy. Until we find Mother and receive her cells, we can't be whole again. Geostigma and a legacy aren't enough. Not for a true Reunion. What do you mean? But, sir, surely you've noticed? [GRUNTS] Jeez, sorry about that. Aah! The stigma! [PEOPLE GASPING] [GROWLS] Can't you people just stay indoors?! [PEOPLE MURMURING] Here. I said I'd live out both our lives. Easy to make that promise. So you wanna be in SOLDIER? Hang in there. Hey, you doing okay? Well, what are you gonna do once we get to Midgar? We're friends, right? [GUNFIRE] Pops, park us over by the rocks! Cloud, ride's over! [CHUCKLES] ZACK: My honor, my dreams... they're yours now. You'll be my living legacy. I swore that I would never forget. I tried. But l... [GRUNTING] SEPHIROTH: Don't pretend you're sad. Why tremble with anger that's not even there? Face it, Cloud. All you are is an empty puppet. [MARLENE HUMMING] [GASPS] Wanna play? I guess that's a no. Where's Mother? Huh? [GROANS] Gross. Hey, where's Mother? There's no one here! Fine. Play with me. [CHUCKLES] This'll be fun. [♪♪♪] [BOTH GRUNTING] [CHUCKLES] [LOZ YELLS] MARLENE: Tifa! [CELL PHONE RINGING] [GASPS] She's not here. I'm not crying! No, I got it. I'll bring the girl. Where were we? [GASPS] [GROANING] Hmm? Cloud... Just run! [GASPS] GIRL: Sorry about before. Thank you. Sure. My little brother... Well, he's gone. I see. Hey, I know you've got it too. Come on, they'll fix us. [♪♪♪] Hm. Tifa? Tifa! You're late... Who did this? He didn't say. Marlene?! [♪♪♪] Damn! [GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] You know, you're pretty heavy. Weren't there some kids living with you? Because they ain't here. RUDE: You don't care? I just... [SIGHS] You're a real handful. [DOOR SLAMS] Tifa said to take you home, kid. Grab on. [DENZEL GRUNTING] So who's gonna fix us? Mmm... I don't know. Hmm. Whatever. Like it matters anymore. [♪♪♪] [MARLENE WHIMPERING] Look at what Brother was hiding. Powers forged in the Lifestream. [CHUCKLES] With this materia, those powers will be ours. So those are a gift from Mother? KADAJ: Yeah, gotta be. Then Brother's hiding Mother too? No, it's that Shinra guy. Keeping her hidden is something they've always been very good at. Then all we gotta do is check everywhere that's got anything to do with Shinra. Mm. But we'll have plenty of help soon. Boy, I can't wait. But first, we need a word with Brother. He likes to pretend he's not part of the family. How he breaks my heart. [YELLS] [SCREAMS] Yeah. [GASPS] Reno and Rude are out looking. You have geostigma, don't you? You're gonna give up and die. Is that it? So it is. There's no cure. Yeah, but that's not stopping Denzel, is it? Don't run. Let's fight it together. We can help each other, I know we can. I guess that only works for real families. Tifa... I'm not fit to help anyone. Not my family, not my friends. Nobody. Dilly-dally, shilly-shally... Dilly-dally, shilly-shally... I think she wants you to move on, man. Did you find them? No, only a witness. Kadaj's gang took the kids. Where are they? They're at their base now. The Forgotten City. [♪♪♪] Mother has given me a very special gift: The power to fight against a planet that torments humanity! She gave this gift to all her children. That's right. You and I are brethren. Brothers and sisters chosen when we inherited Mother's memetic legacy through the Lifestream. But... the planet doesn't approve of that at all. It's doing everything it can to hold us back. That's why it's racking our bodies with pain and filling our hearts with doubt! Now I shall heal you. And we will go to Mother together! We will join as a family and strike back at the planet! Do as I do. Ahh. [CHUCKLES] Denzel. Denzel! [CHUCKLES] See, Mother? All my new brothers and sisters! They can keep me company, just until I find you. [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING] [♪♪♪] AERITH: You came. Even though you're about to break. That's a good sign. So... why did you come? I think I want to be forgiven. Yeah. More than anything. By who? [♪♪♪] [GASPS] [CLOUD YELLS] [GRUNTING] I'm glad you could make it. I only came for the kids. See this man? He's our big brother. But alas, in our happy flock, he's what you'd call a black sheep. MARLENE: Cloud! [CHUCKLES] [LOZ YELLS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [KADAJ CHUCKLING] [ALL GRUNTING] See, I knew I'd be no help. Vincent. What do you know about this? I come here often. I've seen what Kadaj's group is doing. The stigma. It's a symptom of alien matter infesting the body. The body tries to eliminate it and overcompensates. Inside our bodies is a current, like the Lifestream. That current is what fights off any malevolent intruders. What do you mean by "intruder"? VINCENT: The Sephiroth gene. Jenova's memetic legacy. Call it what you want. You're well-informed. Tseng and Elena. They were brought here half-dead. They must have been brutally tortured. I did what I could to save them, but... Well, we'll see. Tortured? They had it coming. They got their hands on Jenova's head. Then when Kadaj says he's looking for "Mother"... Heaven's dark harbinger. The calamity, Jenova. If they wanted to, they could re-create Sephiroth. Kadaj... What is he? Hm. I'd rather not know. [RUSTLING] Marlene! Cloud! Denzel and Tifa! Tifa is all right. I wanna talk to her! May I? You don't have a phone? Vincent, will you bring Marlene to Tifa? I'm gonna go see Shinra and get a few answers. I can't do that. But I... Forget it, Cloud! Why don't you ever pay any attention to us? Marlene, please give me some time. There's a battle to be fought, but it's not as simple as just fighting it. Understand? MARLENE: No, I don't! Cloud, you sure this is about fighting? CLOUD: Where are they? RUDE: They're at their base now. The Forgotten City. Go. I have to talk to Rufus. Stop running! I know. Even if you find the kids, you might not be able to help them. Maybe something will happen that can never unhappen. That scares you, doesn't it? But you need to really think about now. Look at you! You think you've got it so damn hard. Well, you hate being alone, so let people in! Sure, you might not answer the phone, but I don't see you throwing it away either! You go. The base is all yours. Which is it? A memory, or us? CLOUD: But I let you die. AERITH: Dilly-dally, shilly-shally. Isn't it time you did the forgiving? Are sins ever forgiven? I've never tried. You mean... Never tried... Marlene, let's go. Well, I'm gonna try. I'll phone in the verdict. [♪♪♪] REEVE [ON PHONE]: It's me, Reeve. How's work going? I saw your flyer. How in the world do you stay in business? You never change, Cloud. I was thinking about helping you out, but I guess I'll call back another time. Goodbye for now. YUFFIE: Surprise! It's me, Yuffie. MAN: So, hey, all the kids are suddenly missing from Wutai. Weird. Have you heard anything about it? Give me a ring and fill me in, okay? AERITH: I never blamed you, not once. You came for me. That's all that matters. [♪♪♪] [CROWD CHATTERING AND SHOUTING] Hey, you listening? What have you done with these kids? [RUMBLING] [ROARING] [CROWD SCREAMING] [SCREECHING] Denzel! Denzel! Denzel! [GASPS] [GRUNTS] RENO: And what are we up to? Huh? Hm. We know. Mother is here. Oh, yeah? Yeah, this thing... Monument thing? Shinra made it. So you think we hid her here? Did you? Why ask us? Where we hid her is classified info. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Seems you do have something to hide. [STAMMERS] Rude, you and your big mouth! [YELLS] Does it hurt? Oh... Oh. Mm-hm. A bit. But not as bad as Denzel's. Is there a cure? I don't know. After all you did. You've been trying so hard to find a cure for Denzel. You knew about that? Cloud, you should clean off your desk once in a while. Maybe I should. So is that why? Is that the reason why you had to leave, Cloud? Because you couldn't fix Denzel? Or because you have the sickness too? I just thought I couldn't care for myself. Let alone anyone else. How you supposed to look after your family if you can't even look after yourself? Or at least Daddy says so. Cloud, don't give up. [♪♪♪] In the past, you've always looked after me. You and Denzel and Tifa. You were there whenever I needed you. Well, now it's my turn. Mm-hm. [WIND WHISTLING] SHINRA: Say, Kadaj. I've got a question for you. I've got an answer. You told me that you needed Jenova cells in order to be whole again, right? What did you mean by that? Him. He's coming back. [♪♪♪] SHINRA: Sephiroth. The nightmare. KADJA: So they say. You mean... I've never known Sephiroth. I just... l sense him there. It's unbearable to think Mother might want Sephiroth more than... Poor little Remnant. It doesn't matter who she picks! You'll all meet the same end! Mother came to this planet after a long journey. To rid the cosmos of fools like you! But you know as well as I do... nothing's changed since she got here. I have to change it. To make her happy! If Mother willed it, I'd do anything for her! Hm. The nightmare returns. As long as you exist, the nightmares will come again and again. The Lifestream courses through our world, ever flowing between the edge of life and death. If that cycle is the very truth of life, then history, too, will inevitably repeat itself. Go on, bring your Jenovas and your Sephiroths. Cause trouble till your heart's content. We'll do as life mandates, we promise. We won't let you win and we'll stop you. Please, sir, is that your excuse for going after Mother yourself? You don't seem all that sorry. Sorry? The truth is, I actually enjoy it. Good. Then let's put an end to all this. [♪♪♪] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER CRASHING] [ROARING] [CROWD SCREAMING] Denzel, we've got to get away! [ROARING] [YELLS] [RUDE GRUNTS] Hello... Hell, no. [GRUNTING] Is it after us? I'm not looking! [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [YAZOO CHUCKLES] Are we having fun yet? The time of my life. [♪♪♪] [ALL GRUNTING] When are you gonna call it a day!? What? Just as soon as you give back Mother, that'll be the end of everything. [YELLING] Punks. What do you need Jenova's head for? [RUDE YELLS] Forget your little Reunion and get a grip! All we want is to be with Mother! Mother will know. When she gets here, she'll decide what's best. Now, where's Mother? [GRUNTING] Mother, shmother. It's Jenova's frigging head! Hey! Don't refer to Mother that way. You meanie! Mm. Our apologies. Your ma's cool... What the hell am I saying?! [ALL GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] [ROARING] Tifa? Son of a bitch! [ROARING] You look after Momma. Barret! Marlene better be safe, huh? [♪♪♪] [YELLING] We can handle this! [HEAVES] So who's been touching my materia? The bad guys, naturally. Ooh! Who's that? She's a beaut! My Shera, the latest model! I'll give you the grand tour afterward! Where can I buy a phone? Who's he? They're our friends. Denzel, can you make it to the bar? Uh-huh. [PEOPLE GRUNTING] [DENZEL WHIMPERING] Enough! Tifa! Denzel! [GRUNTING] [ROARING] Cloud! Sorry that it took me so long. It's all right. TIFA: You okay? DENZEL: Yeah. Marlene will be safe. I took her home. I feel lighter. Hm? Maybe I lost some weight. All that dilly-dallying. I'm gonna go back to see Marlene, okay, Cloud? We'll wait for you! Hey, Cloud. See you there, right? Mm-hm. [PEOPLE SHOUTING AND SCREAMING] [ROARING] I gotta do this! [YELLS] [YELLING] [ROARING] [GUN CLICKS] [CAIT SITH YELLING] [YELLING] The hell you been? [♪♪♪] [ROARING] This is too fun, sir! Any requests for the next act? [GASPS] Mother? A good son would have known. [SCREAMS] Alley-oop! Giddyap! There you go! Fly! No giving up! AERITH: Ready? [SCREECHING] [KADAJ SCREAMS] [♪♪♪] Mother! Sir, no! Sir, no! [RENO & RUDE GRUNTING] [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING] [♪♪♪] RENO: Sir. [BOTH GRUNTING] [LAUGHS] [GROWLS] You losers are chasing the wrong guy! Bang, bang, bang! Huh? [BOTH SCREAM] [LAUGHS] [RUDE GROANS] Rude! Huh? [RENO SCREAMING] No, no, no! Don't do this to me! Hey, Rude! You're all right! Yeah. I'm just peachy. [BOTH GRUNTING] Hm? [BOTH CHUCKLE] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Hey, guys! [LOZ & YAZOO LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] Hey, partner. This thing got any bite to it? Shinra technology at its finest. Oh, so you made this. If nothing else, it's flashy. Oh, good. You love it. I know. Looks like today we're clocking out early. Mother! [♪♪♪] [GASPING] Mother! [SOBBING] [SCREAMS] [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING] [♪♪♪] [LAUGHS] [GRUNTING] [BOTH GASP] AERITH: Let's go, Cloud. Brother. I'm with her at last. So, what's gonna happen now? [LAUGHS] Mother's going to tell me. I guess a Remnant wouldn't really know. [♪♪♪] So what if I'm a puppet? Once upon a time... you were too! [BOTH GRUNTING] Cloud, I brought you materia! Hey, watch it! Yo, Cid! Park this turkey! Shut up! You want off? Then jump! Get off my back! He can handle this alone. YUFFIE: Huh? VINCENT: Kadaj is a Remnant of Sephiroth. Think of him as a sort of larval form. Larva? You mean he's an insect! Lassie, shut your gob. CID: So the punk's gonna become Sephiroth. Vincent, does Cloud know about Kadaj? One would think. Then you're right. It's his fight now. Why, I don't get it? Why can't we help out!? This is man talk. Sexist! Sexist! Crikey, lass, shut yer mooth! The men don't get it either. TIFA: Two years ago, think of the strength we all had when we fought that last battle. It's only been a couple years, but already that feeling is gone. But Cloud, I think he's found it again. He's got 10 minutes. That Cloud's a royal pain in the ass, like always. Cloud is Cloud. [YELLING] My Reunion. Bet you're dying to watch. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] Good to see you, Cloud. [♪♪♪] Your geostigma is gone? That's too bad. Sephiroth, what do you want? The last thoughts of geostigma's dead. Those Remnants will join the Lifestream and girdle the planet, choking it, corroding it. What I want, Cloud, is to sail the darkness of the cosmos with this planet as my vessel, just as my mother did long ago. Then one day we'll find a new planet, and on its soil we'll create a shining future. What about this planet? Well, that's up to you. [THUNDER CRASHING] Is it her? [CLOUD GRUNTING] Where did you find this strength? I'm not about to tell you! [BOTH GRUNTING] I've thought of a wonderful present for you. Shall I give you despair? On your knees! I want you to beg for forgiveness. [GRUNTING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [♪♪♪] Is this the pain you felt before, Cloud? Let me remind you. This time, you won't forget. Tell me what you cherish most. Give me the pleasure of taking it away? ZACK: So what if it looks hopeless? If it were me, I still wouldn't give up. Embrace your dreams. And, whatever happens, protect your honor as SOLDIER! Well, okay, you never made SOLDIER. But it's what's in here that counts. Zack? Well? You need a hand with him? You already beat him once, didn't you? This should be a cinch. Yeah. Cloud. You know what I told you. That's right. I am your living legacy. [♪♪♪] I pity you. You just don't get it at all. There's not a thing I don't cherish! [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTING] Stay where you belong. In my memories. I will never be a memory. [GRUNTING] Brother... AERITH: Kadaj? Huh? [♪♪♪] You don't have to hang on any longer. Mother, is that...? Everyone's waiting, if you're ready. BOY: We're cured! [PEOPLE CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Oh, yeah, we rock! See, what'd I tell you fools? That's my boy, Cloud! You're the chips and gravy. A little push is what he needs, that's all! CID: Y'all calm down, hang on to your britches! Somehow I knew you were there. Thank you. [GUNSHOT] We'll go together... Together, we'll play... [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [BOTH YELLING] Cloud! [THUNDER RUMBLING] He'll come back. He said that he would. [PHONE RINGING] [GASPS] Let's go! [PHONES RINGING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] Mother? AERITH: Again? Why is everyone calling me their mother lately? ZACK: I guess they must be fond of you. AERITH: This one's a little too big to adopt. ZACK: Tough luck, friend. Sounds like you don't have a place here. [♪♪♪] It's like she said: "Wait here and Cloud will come back." MARLENE: Welcome back! I'm back. There are still children with the stigma. Yeah. Hey, let's get you fixed up. Come on, I'm here. It's okay. [LAUGHS] [ALL CHEERING] Last one in is a rotten egg! It's working! [ALL CHATTERING] You see? Everything's all right. CLOUD: I know. I'm not alone. Not anymore. [♪♪♪] DENZEL: Is this somebody's grave? CLOUD: No.
