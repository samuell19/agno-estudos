Peter! Peter! Peter! The Eighth Day Of The Week What happened? Did something collapse? I'm sorry! I got up late and have to hurry! Yes, right. You'll see this house collapse one day because of him! When you live in an old bombarded house you have to be more careful! Oh! New piece in your wardrobe! Did you buy it? I think you're selling yours. You wear less and less. You don't watch Italian movies, so you don't know how women dress. But you don't go to the cinema. But I go with you... To where? It makes me sad. That I can't offer you anything better. Come to my foxhole. I assured If I go it will be forever. You alone keep telling me you can't live in this ruin. It's raining. What's left is the cafe. Hey there! Coats please! It seems there are no seats. Let's dance for now. Tomorrow I don't have classes. Let's go to the park. Let's just hope for... the sun. The devil knows If the weather improves. Get up. It's 7AM already. Didn't I tell father I have a day off? Funny how they teach philosophy these days. Mr. Zawadzki! Make yourself ready! Price per minute everywhere! Even at home, damn it! All these years I've been renting your place, and... I never have time to shave to the end. Agnes! The kitchen is free. I'm leaving. Please excuse me. Not to forget the briefcase. How are you feeling today? Poor darling. Yes.. Yes. Daddy! You forgot your briefcase! Big time! You intend to go out again. Where are you going now? I'm leaving the city. To do what? ... To study. Can't you study at home? ... What I'm learning, I can't learn in here. Excursions like this end badly. Where is Gregory? He's asleep. Don't be too loud. You'll wake him up. Your tea, please. Finally ... Goodbye! I'll be back in the evening. Thank God not at night. You were drinking again. Again... I do it all the time. Mother is annoying. The faucet is leaking. Why do I keep coming back... Gregory... Don't make a noise. I told mother you're sleeping. Do you have to litter on people's heads? How good here is... So quiet. No one is screaming. No one is bothering. No one is rushing others. And we're all alone. Alone. I was almost certain... We'd never make it together. That it always would rain. Does the world through these glasses... Always looks this blue? It's even worse without them. Don't say it. You witness such a tearful spring season, bestowing on you this wonderful time. I will entirely melt in this sun. Wait. I'll sunbathe. It will rain again tomorrow. Neither I'll be able to look into your eyes... Nor touch you again. You and your melancholy. At one point I'll finish college. You'll get a decent room. We'll live together at last. If the ruin where I stay doesn't bury me in between. Isn't there a person, who may... Be better, less miserable than I? Listen... Conceding you love me. Don't let me wait. God, what a jerk! You're only about yourself. Can't you see what happens to me? You want me to give myself to you like any other girl on the eyes of everyone?! We have to find to our own little corner. Few meters of concrete, which would allow me to spend this moment undisturbed. Understand, I don't want to be afraid of someone coming in. I don't want to become a joke! I don't want to feel like a thief! To wait... You are... Who am I? I don't believe you love me. Next week, maybe tomorrow something will happen and take you away from me, forever. You don't trust me. I simply don't believe my luck. Get up jerk! We're going back at once. I can hope, you have in your foxhole... Something like a bed. 4PM at your place. Would you move already? I'll never make it. I'll have the flowers. Which kind? ... Pretty ones. For a wife? A fiance? ... For a mother-in-law. Hi Mr. Neighbour. Untie me, I want to go outside. Where, how? Alone in the street? I 'll do that, your mother will come and make a scene. Please don't untie him! He'll fall! Just like the son of Mr. and Mrs. Majewski. You see little brother. You see, you see, you can't. When are you going to to visit me? I'll buy you a sweet pastry. Bye! Someone catch the baby! Hold him! Attention! Attention! Please leave the street! Danger area! Getting close to the building is a major risk! Attention! Attention! Danger of a collapse! What was it? I have the feeling that I don't have an apartment any more. Move the ladder now! Hold on! Are you crazy?! Not myself, the house. Move away! It's falling! Once more we can't be alone. Poor soul. Where will you go? I'll have to rent some lodging. Hi there! Hi. Hi. I heard you might need a tenant. Someone came by last week. Did he move in? Move in he did... To the hospital. Please listen, no jokes. Not joking, my pad collapsed. I need to live with you a couple of days. Move aside. Quiet! Be quiet, dear friend. You can't even behave in a share. Check the Venus out! Share a flower, Agnes. Leave her alone! Let her glow! Where were you, Agnes? On a walk. Alone? ... Who would stroll by himself... I was with one... Very sweet boy. Who! What! With whom were you? We were at... You believe she was strolling! ... I'm telling you be careful. I bet you loiter with some punk instead of staying home. All I need is an impudent child! Christ! One wouldn't think of it back then. I am of legal age. I keep on feeding you! Your cooking isn't worth reminding of. Oh, Agnes. Alright! I'm going to study in the kitchen. Yes! You're running! Don't want to listen! Oh, I'm telling you! You'll remember my words! Loiter! Loiter with delinquents! You'll see it ends bad. It will be too late. But of course, you don't listen. Good evening. I didn't hear you coming in. What are you up to? I'm fixing this motorcycle. The only thing... Is to install the clutch. On Sunday, I'll ride to my fiance! On Sunday. If only one knew what that day will bring. Everyone is waiting for Sunday. Father definitely wants to go fishing. Gregory waits for his girlfriend. And I? Now It is you. Did you hear anything? What about? Don't you trick me. If it's true she's cheating, I'll ruin her face. No hospital will admit her upon request. Do you really love her? More than you imagine. Why mistrust at every step? Why listen to other's babble? Listen, you're all the same. Therefore, there's no point in talking to you. I'll tell you one thing. A human wants things only for himself. There's no solution for that. A human wants... To have something for himself. Men. Is this you Gregory? Did Gregory come back? It's only Mr. Zawadzki leaving. Where then is your little brother? I don't know. Probably drinking somewhere again. I'll pull him out of the bar! I'll tell him! Leave him. He'll be there tomorrow again. Why is that? You don't understand. He's fallen in love. He keeps on waiting for her. But he has parents! A home! A sister, damn it! Should I be calm when my son wanders through dive bars? I'll go and use force to bring him home. Home... Where he doesn't have his corner? Where mother always bother us? Agnes. Why don't we understand each other? I'm getting old. Gregory is drinking. Mother is constantly sick. What does she want from you? It's easy. I'm a whore. Agnes, please let it go. Oh God, I'd want to have some rest. Won't you go fishing? I could... this Sunday. IF only it doesn't rain again. Stefan ... Will someone finally get Gregory? Yes, Yes. I'm going my dear. Couldn't you stand up? You have to ready your fishing rods... For Sunday. I'll go get him. Agnes! How are you? So happy to meet you! Allow me to introduce you my fiance: Spotty! Good evening. Excuse me! I'm looking for my brother. Was she? No. You're drunk Gregory. Tell me something I don't know. I could have a round or two. Could you pick the tab? I don't know If I can but I'll do it. Another round? Until Sunday. Just to last until Sunday. She had said... I need a week to think it over. I lie to myself she's going to come back. That all of a sudden on my forehead, I'll feel her long fingers! I'm sorry, I thought it was Carol! If she doesn't come until Sunday evening... I'll end this. What do you think, Agnes? She'll be back? I'm sure. Don't worry. You speak as If you wanted to make yourself happier. We have what we deserve. What? Why do you, child, need to contemplate the lack of happiness? Because of the few hundred square feet. But my own. I had a legal promise for an apartment. Mr. Terlecki... Mr. Terlecki... Yes?! ... You're from the collapsed house? Please come back in three weeks. But Sir, where am I going to live? I was in first! You see mister. All of these people were in first. Are you married? I was about to marry in a week! People have been married for 20 years and have to wait, too! I also have a family! Standing here with three kids! Look at him! Can I tell you something? Get married! With a widow, after you, sir! I have no apartments this month! What can I do? There are no apartments! They're producing at 250%. They tell you to wait. I've foreseen everything. I only don't know when you'll leave me. Agnes... Do I really know so little about you? You could know more. Do something, so we can be alone for a few hours. All I can do is borrow a place from a friend, but you won't go. I will. Agnes! What love? ... If it wasn't for you I wouldn't want to live. You're the only thing I truthfuly believe in. Dear God. Isn't there really a place for people in love? Couldn't you stand up straight? Today is payday, there are so many creeps. Come quick, maybe we'll get through. Doll! Kiddie! One time and you'll give me happiness. Stop, cutie! Don't be so stubborn! Look at her, a 'geisha'. It doesn't matter if she's not from around. Please stop, I know these thugs. They'll massacre you! What would you do If you had a doll like this? I'd use her, then cry! Dear angel! Laying on the cross and waiting for the nail! If you move I don't know you. Does lady live alone? Leave her alone Mr. Z, she's a healthy girl. She'd murder you! But she's a good girl! Won't say no to any of us! A body like this is a treasure! Legs like that are made to measure! Stop, I beg you! I know her! Hey Miss! Do you remember the night in Zakopane! Does this guy pay her bills? Hey, young man! Teach us! Don't think about it. Think of what's going to be tomorrow. Can you hear me? Tomorrow, around this time. We'll be together again. We'll be alone... Alone! Leave me, go away! I still have the strength, don't I? Young people like you. Have no idea how amazing is physical energy! Sometimes I look at these skinny wimps and pity falls upon me! These men are weak like overcooked spiders! Come, drink tea. I hope they won't order me retirement? You and your ideas. Me and my ideas? Things happen. It's not easy for a job these days. Agnes... Do I look like I'm fifty-five years old? You look like forty-five at most. You should excercise! It gives you plenty. Gregory should too. No one asked for him? No. She has to loiter with her nerd. I can die. You can die. But she has to be hooking up. You want me to be hooking up with you?! Gregory? I think so! Please don't turn on the light. What do you dream of? I dream of happiness. How about a prince? About a prince? Maybe, one full of complexities. You're drunk! No, I want to see my dreams on real terms. Probably in the eighth day of the week! It's unimportant in which day of... the week. If only it was... A day when dreams come true. You didn't repair the faucet after all? Our beloved home. How nice to be here! The water reached its boiling point. Can't you hear it's boiling? Make me my herbs! Turn the light on. Here you are. Agnes! How are you? Allow me to introduce you my fiance: Pip! Good evening. Elle, have you seen Gregory? He's not in here. I think he went downtown. Agnes! Who is he in love with? With my watch! Have a good night. Cab! Are you free? Where to? Downtown, please. Downtown... It's not a place for young women. Where on Earth you know is a place for young women. You don't look like. You really don't look like. A man is stupid until his death. The end. Have fun miss. You drunken fool. Don't cry us, the willow trees. From grief, that slits the heart. Don't cry my baby girl. Cause in the resistance isn't bad. Where is the watch? In the kitchen, every second... A teardrop is falling down the sink. Is she back? No. Then why are you here? Mother can't sleep while you're out. I can't sleep at all. Leave me! Drink. You know that it has to be better. For sure. But tell me how am I supposed to forget the past? What have we lived with? What about love? You believe she'll come back, don't you? Considering, she comes back. She'll leave her husband, kids. She will stay with me. What can I give her? Does the world we live in... Is a place where love can thrive? In reality, I have nothing. During the war, I was a hero. But now... I'm... Who am I, Agnes? You're a pig. In the old days, I'd shoot for similar words. But now... What did I keep? From the war, the old days? Nothing. Just my tiny scar. Don't cry us, the willow trees... From grief, that slits the heart... Don't cry my baby girl... Cause in the resistance... Isn't bad. Boss, quarter of a bottle! Agnes? I'm coming. I'll tell you how my love story ends. I don't want to listen! But why? I hate sadness and surrendering. I hate the color black. It's good for the dead. And us, we're alive. You know what? I think I love you a lot. At last. I couldn't get into the tram! ... It's Saturday, a madhouse. Police stopped me from bunching in. They should have realized you have a date. Where are your glasses? No, no. It's nothing. Listen... Let's leave this place. The station always reminds me of goodbyes. When will this borrowed place be ready? At 7PM ... We have an hour time. The coatcheck is mandatory. Yes, please? Two black coffees ... Won't you say anything? I'm scared. I always feared. It never came up as I wanted to. Well, now I'm scared like hell. And me?! You've slept with someone, haven't you? I'll be sleeping with you now and only that's important. Petey. What did you feel, when... You first slept with a woman? I felt the cold. It was outside. Romeo! Are we going!? The check please for God's sake! I said you've paid. Come on! ... The key was supposed to be under the mat. It isn't. He didn't leave it. Go knock ... Maybe he couldn't? Go knock. Man, damn it! I totally forgot, what an error. Come right in. Come on, come on. What an error. I forgot to death. I'm really sorry. We'll find the space. Here, right through. Please excuse this disorder in my humble studio. But... I've been very busy today. That's why I forgot about you. Oh well, nothing is lost. We'll manage somehow. I have a guest. A very kind guest. Oh well. It won't be a problem, right? I met her on the train. She was going back to someone. To a husband or a fiance. Who knows! The world is... Very small! For the most part, we all meet... In bed. There is the other sofa! Quiet. I'll make your bed right now. Here you go. Lay down. We won't be a bother. Just please, don't stain my sheets. Thank you so much, we'll lay down somewhere else. Why? Is this... Your cat moaning up the stairs? The cat? Yes, indeed. So what? You came in to get some work done, haven't you? Bang on his face, Petey. Why? Quiet, quiet. This was as punishment for starving the animal. We're going. Hold on, a moment... I have to take a closer look. Look! You went mad, come on ... Look how pretty her lips are, nose. It's a shame she's drunk. We could have seen her eyes. Can you see her pretty breasts? Wonder who can be waiting for her like this. She's no older than twenty. You're crazy! ... Something else! Bang on his face again, Petey. This because, you don't water the plants. You don't act with respect... To either flora or fauna, dear sir. What is evil, is not us. Good night. What's wrong with you? Do you want to break up? I understand. It's sad, but... I understand. Respect. Honor. These aren't such silly things. You feel at ease. It's better to break up. Is this the only thing life has taught you? To give up? It's better to leave, than to watch how it all goes down. I love you, and I'll never leave you. Do you understand? Never. An empty bench! Let's go eat something. I'm sorry, but I don't have any money. How bad, me neither. Where to, Peter? I don't know. Let's hide at the construction site. Here you are the land of... People in love. I love you and I'll stay with you! I want to finally sleep with you. Whatever where and how. This performance is free of charge. I wonder If it'll end before act 1. Where to? We're closing in fifteen minutes. Just a moment ... Ok. Only quick. Attention! Attention! We remind you that it is almost 9PM. No more sales today. Please begin to exit the department store. Move aside! Lady, you're insane. Anyone there? It looks like they closed us inside. It will get us pneumonia. Know what. I need to have a drink. Only this, will save you from getting a cold. Here, drink as it was medicine. Drink... But, drink... More, more, more... I'm a bit warmer now. Forty percent equals thirty one dollars. It appears, that... I don't have enough but I'll leave what I have left. At least they'll know the thief was an honest one. Darn, how are we going to get out of here? There has to be a way. Come, here's a way out! "Married Young Couples Week". Agnes! Agnes come! Read what it says here: "WELCOME PEOPLE IN LOVE". In Love, in... Love. Where are we? We got so drunk. Come, come. Here, we'll... Holy Moley! We have to go! In the department store. We'll be in trouble, get up! Can, we? Get up, now! ... My coat! Now! ... Thief! Thief! How the hell did you end up in here?!? He's drunk! What are you waiting for? Call the police! I didn't steal a thing, lieutenant. You must have stayed on purpose. If you haven't been hiding, someone would notice your presence. Say the truth! I went to the Department of Housing... nine times. Here's the whole truth. Hello? Yes, yes. Nothing? Completely nothing? Alright, this makes me happy. Bye. The department store confirmed nothing is missing. You're free. What the hell do you think, sir, that... I don't understand what it is like without your own place? You have to bother them. You have to go everyday. Make it today again. You have enough time. Do you have any money? I'll lend you, for the tram. Excuse me! You disturb the place. Agnes! Call me Agnes If you want. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Looking for death? With me in tow! Hello, Agnes! Agnes! How are you? This is my best girlfriend. Allow me to introduce: Dudu... I know, your fiance. How did you know? I myself don't know how it came to my head. We arrest you. You're not going to wander in this rain. Taxi, hey! "Give me your hand, the sourroundings can't be seen". "The night will lead us, like its gray hue". "Without our faces, we walk, into eternal bliss". Let's dance! Come on! I'm tired. To give you energy. To rainfall's health. I don't understand. If it wasn't for the rain, you wouldn't have met Ella. If it wasn't for the rain, I wouldn't have met you. Where do you know Ella from? We went to college together. She quit after the second year. Are you finishing? What major? Philosophy. A profession dedicated to the faultless explaining of life's truths. Journalist. A profession dedicated to writing the absolute and accurate truth. Let's have a drink. I don't drink to rain's well being. To sunshine's health. To... sun. "It's only darkness holding me back, from you." "I anticipate there are men like you". To... sun! "Dear sundown of beautiful and bright days." "When Autumn becomes silent, I become too." To sun! ... "Before the night's play, kind you". "Hand me down your arm". "Because you're with me, right?". "It's just darkness". "Holding me from you". Come in. One..., Two... Three... Five! Stupid girl! Couldn't you find someone else? Like I needed that virginity of yours! For the money I've spent with you I could've had a decent whore. It's looking fantastic! For that it happened to me. I'll be looking great too. Wife is coming back in three hours. Damn it! Will I have enough time to clean up? What came to your head? Considering your beauty, you shoud've been an experienced whore. What have you waited for? The sun. Please excuse my behaviour. It's gone, I'm sorry. What do you think, what do we make from this? Yesterday you gulped it like a fish. If only we can clean up on time. This beast is coming. She'll make a nightmare out of my sleep. I have so much work to do. So, what the hell have you waited for? You didn't have any boyfriend? It's beyond reason. I've been telling you. Oh, yea? ... Now you're trying to connote I've seduced you. What the fuck is your name after all? No connotations. What's your name? How am I supposed to call you? Call me however you like. You can... Darling. Or... Honey. Treasure. Sweetheart. Best would be the Sun, wouldn't it? So good. Yes... The lovely Sun. We've met during the rain, so... On the basis of loneliness. Whatever a human does... He does because of longing for better times. Yes. The lovely Sun. Come, help me take the sheets off, it'll be faster. I'll be ok. Now, I'm really sorry. My nervous system is worn out. Forgive me. We have to see each other somehow. It's beyond reason. It's nothing. Don't worry. Listen, how are we going to meet? We'll never see each other again. Bye. My name is Agnes Walicka. You can tell stories about me to your friends, goodnight. My regards to your wife. Quiet! She's sleeping. Who is she? Mary, my fiancee. So she's back? It's all lies what they've said about her. Life would be a lot nicer If it wasn't for the "nice" people. I think we woke her. We're getting married this week. Wish me well. Congratulations. Positive feelings are always gratified. That is the rhythm of our world. Goodnight, I'm going to sleep a little. Stefan. Stefan, wake up! What do you want? ... No one is here. It must be Agnes again. Wandering in the night with some. Leave her alone! ... Agnes? How's the weather tomorrow? I searched you everywhere. All evening around the city. Do you know what happened? We have an apartment. Look, here's the key. Why aren't you asleep, the night's still on. What's wrong with you? I said to myself, the first night has to be spent with you! But it's our apartment, ours only. Agnes, come! Listen ... I have to tell you something. It can be cruel, but I can't lie. You... Asked me once If I had slept with someone before. Yes. I'm with someone for long and I love him. I met you, when... We were having a fight. Forgive me. I know I caused you great pain. If it's going to help you, you can hit me. Now take this key and leave. I hate sadness and surrender. I hate the color black. It's good for the dead. Peter! Peter! Dear Peter! The End
