Shoot! Go on! We take life for a reason. We have to kill in order for us to live. GON, THE LITTLE FOX Shoot! Go on! Go on, Hyoju! You thieving fox! Darn that fox Gon! We need to slay him soon. Hyoju. You aren't missing on purpose, are you? Of course not. You'd better not be. Being soft-hearted won’t help you. Not just you. A ravaged farm will starve your mom. Yeah, I know. The rain won't stop. How's your mom? Not well. I see. Take this and go catch an eel. Rain makes the eels come out. Eating eel will help her health. Cheer up. Yeah. When the rain stops Hyoju will get an eel. Eat it and get well. Eel? That's nice. I'd love to have eel. Did Hyoju catch that? Mom, here's for you. Oh, it's akebia. Thank you. You can stay as you are. My soft-hearted Hyoju. Ah! Hold it! Hey! You thieving fox! Give me back my eel! That eel is for my mom! It's for my mom! That eel is for my mom! It's for my mom! His mom… We never had a mom either. Ever since we were born. But you have friends. She must have felt regret. Leaving her only son behind. I'm sure. His mom died? It's your fault. It's because of you. Because of your prank, Hyoju couldn't have his mom eat eel. Hyoju's mom was ill. That's why Hyoju was catching eel. I shouldn't have played that prank. Sardines! Get them cheap! Sardines, anyone? Hey, over here. Yes, ma'am. Why did you snitch sardines? I didn't. Then how did the sardines get here? I have no idea. But that sardine vendor sure was quick with his fist. Which vendor was it? I don't know. I've never seen him before. It's your fault. Hyoju got punched because of you. You got punched because you're so soft-hearted. Brace up. If you had killed that fox then, your mom could have had eel. Don't say that! Huh? It’s weird. Recently. Huh? Recently, something strange happens. What happens? Ever since my mom died, somebody brings me chestnuts and mushrooms every day. Yeah? Who is it? Well… So who's doing it? I don't know. He does it when I'm not looking. Strange things happen. But I think… This is what I think. I think… What do you think? No, never mind. I don't think it's a human doing that. I bet it's a deity. Huh? A deity felt pity for you being left alone. So he's blessing you with those things. Do you think so? I'm sure of it. So you have to thank him every day. That's silly. There's no such deity. The spider lily season is over, I guess. Mom, are you doing this? I'm sorry to make you worry. I'm so incapable. I couldn't even bring eel for you. Deity, I'm sorry about yesterday. It's time I pulled myself together. Here's the last spider lily this season. I'll be all right now. Don't worry about me. I'll get a little stronger. That rascal fox is here to play some prank again. Oh… Gon… It was you? Producer : Masaaki Oikawa / Takanori Toyokawa Written, Directed & Animated : Takeshi Yashiro
