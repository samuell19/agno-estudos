Oh! That is what I want my wedding dance to look like. A little something to fill your weekend. - How many files? - I didn't count. All right. Well, I'm off to pick out a wedding cake with David. Oh, that's a healthy lunch. If you grab me a celery juice, I'll bring you back a slice! Deal! Oh, hi, Bob! Avery. How's the favermann paperwork coming? - It's finished. - Ahead of schedule? Excellent. It's ready to send in, unless you want to make any changes? No, I'm good if you're good. - Great. - Great. - Have a great lunch! - Thank you! So, the first one had lemon zest and raspberry filling, - and now, which one is this? - Holiday forest. Well, I'm at this cake thing. Thank you. Mm. That's pretty yummy. But I feel like I'm still leaning towards the nutcracker one. David, which one do you like? ..Figure that out. Uh, honey, thumbs up doesn't work in this situation. Uh, I gotta go. - What did I miss? - Cake choices. We have Santa and mrs claus, the nutcracker, or holiday forest. (Phones ring) Oop! - What? - Hi. - I already signed the contract. - There's a penalty. - Of course, I can do that. - Ok, I'll call you back. All right, bye. You're a very busy couple! Both: Very! And the wedding is December 20? - Yep. - 24 days. It's coming up quick. We wanted a storybook Christmas wedding. It's my childhood dream come true. Chef: How wonderful! So, which cake fits your vision for the big day? Oh, er... you pick. Uh... You know what, let's go with the nutcracker one. Excellent choice. Oh, could I have a piece to go? - Yeah, we'll wrap one up for you. - Thank you. I'm glad we scheduled this during our lunch breaks so we could do this together(!) Hey, you took a business call too. David, we're choosing our wedding cake and you hardly even looked at them. You do like the nutcracker cake, right? It was a little glittery. I thought the forest one was more subtle. Well, why didn't you say something? Do you want to go back in and change it? No, no - it's fine. Are you ok today? You just seem edgy. Sorry, yeah. Something came up at the office. I wanted to talk to you about it, - but I gotta run back to work. - Yeah, me too. Oh, did you book the ballroom lessons for the wedding dance? - Uh... - You forgot. Can we talk about it tonight? Yeah - don't worry. I'll take care of it. Ok, I gotta go. I'll see you at dinner. (She sighs) How was the cake? You tell me! Oh, the florist called, asked if they could deliver the bridal bouquet samples - to your apartment this weekend. - Yeah, that's fine. Can you ask my doorman to bring them up to my place if I'm not there? - Sure. - Ok. I'm gonna enjoy my three-minute lunch. Ok! (She sighs) 'Hello. Thanks for calling flurry dance studio. 'If you leave us your name and number, we'll call you right back.' Hello? - Hi! - ..Hi. Did you want to buy tickets to the Christmas waltz? Er, that sounds great, but I was interested in dance lessons for me and my fiance. You know, I tried calling a few times, but no-one answered. Is there someone I could talk to, or...? Yeah, you can talk to me! Oh... Ok. We are having a super mega Christmas dance series discount. Oh, wow. And what is that? So it's ten private lessons for an amazing low price. Plus a free half-hour evaluation! You know, ten lessons, I was kinda hoping for something a little more fast-tracked. - Maybe two or three at the most? - I mean, it's your wedding dance. People are going to be videoing you and they'll post it everywhere. - It has to be awesome. - You're right. I never thought about that. It really does need to be special. Yeah. And special takes lots of practice. Oh, I'd listen to him if I were you. Really? Mm. You'll want ten lessons, minimum. That will get you maximum results. It will, huh? Absolutely! Cos we have the best teachers in town. Like my mom. She'll have you dancing like a pro in no time. All right, well... I think you guys have me sold. You won't be sorry. - See you later? - Yeah. Hey, thanks for the tip. Pleasure! Welcome to flurry dance! - Thank you. I'm excited! - Me too! You were my first sale! (Music: 'O Christmas tree') Hi. Hey! - Sorry I'm late. - It's ok. So I got the ballroom lessons. I'm so excited - we start tomorrow night. I just sent you the contact. Avery, um... I need to talk to you about something. Is everything ok? You seem... You seem kind of serious. You know how they offered me that position of heading up the new financial branch in Boston? Yes, and you said you weren't going to take it. Well... I've been rethinking that decision. David, why would you be rethinking that now? I just... I just don't know if I'll get another shot like this. It's an opportunity of a lifetime. Yeah, but our lives are all planned out here, in New York. I can't just pick up and move to Boston. You took the job, didn't you? They're flying me out to Boston tomorrow, ..and I would have to relocate shortly after. And what about our wedding? We'll just have to... Put a pin in it. Put a pin in our wedding? - David, who says that? - Ok, that didn't come out right. But you have to admit, you knew all the stuff I had going on at work, and... You insisted on setting a date. Because that's what engaged people do! And you've always known that I wanted a Christmas wedding! I'm just asking if we could push pause, so... So that what? So you can decide if you actually want to marry me? Did you take the job to get out of the wedding? Avery, not get out of it. Just table it. Right. Yeah. Well, I'm not going to just sit here while you decide. So, um... Yeah, you know what? I'll make it easy. Why don't you just, um... Let's just say the wedding is off the table. Excuse me. (Door opens) (Door slams) "Wishing you and David a lifetime of happiness." David just took the job, no discussion? No, we discussed it, but he just changed his mind. I can't believe he would ask me to make such a huge shift in my life. He's always been so solid and steady. - I just feel blindsided. - Of course you do. I just wish I could've seen it coming. Then I could've pre-empted it. Hey, you can't pre-empt life. You have to take it as it comes. And, who knows? Maybe this change will lead you to something better. You made the right decision. Well, he made it for me. (Phone beeps) David and I have a ballroom lesson in an hour for our wedding dance. Oh, Avery, this is awful. - Do you mind if I call and cancel? - Yeah, go ahead. 'Hello, thanks for calling flurry dance studio...' and... voicemail. Big shocker. I'll just stop by on my way home. - Hopefully they give refunds. - Hey, you're going to be ok. Of course I will. I'm here for you. Thank you. - You were so good at that! - Thank you! - Hello! - Hi! - So next week? - Yes. Thursday at seven. Hello. Oh, hi. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. - Oh, you're not. I'm just waiting for my class. Are you looking for someone? Yes, the owner. They never answer the phone around here, it's like they've never heard of a virtual receptionist. Oh, it's a good idea. I should look into it. Wait, you're...? You're the owner? You let me think you were a student. It was Nicky's first sale. I wanted to help him out. Well, unfortunately, I'm here to, um... I have to cancel. It's under Avery and David. Wedding dance? Yes... I think we were scheduled with your wife. I don't have a wife. You mean elina? She's my head teacher and probably the closest thing I have to a sister. Anyway, um, we usually ask for 24 hours' notice. But because you're new, I'll let it slide this time. When would you guys like to reschedule for? No, I need to cancel the whole series. Oh, that's a different story. May I ask why? Personal reasons. There is no wedding, so... ..There is no dance. You could always keep the lessons. You don't need to bring a partner. You can dance for yourself. No, I have a very demanding job that keeps me super busy, I don't have extra time in my life to dance just for me. Well, that's a shame. I think you'd be surprised how it can lift your spirits. Not me! No, dancing doesn't come naturally. But you have naturally fluid movement. I could tell by the way you walked into the room. You're... very observant. It's my job! I did actually dance as a kid. Ahh. So what happened? I... I don't know, I-I stopped. Listen, if you don't want to give me the refund, I understand, but... No, no, no, no - you're fine. But you do know the evaluation is free? So... take a chance? You never know, you might surprise yourself. Yeah, I think I, um... Think I've had enough surprises lately. Thanks anyway. Ok, you two. Woman: We were all supposed to go to the Hamptons together, but it didn't work out. - Ah, here she is! - Hi, mom and dad! Hey, sweetie! Darling! How are you doing? Thank you so much. So, any new developments? Have you spoken to David's family yet? No, but I'm sure they've heard all about it. Dad, I hope you can get your deposit back from the Carlisle hotel? Well, let's not be hasty. You know it's quite common for grooms to get cold feet. You can talk this out with David. We have talked. Sweetheart, how can we help? Well, I don't know. I mean, there was always this clear path, you know, for my future. Getting into a great Ivy league school, passing the bar, landing a great job. The only thing left was marriage to a solid guy from a good family. You'll just have to make a new plan. Yeah, but what is that? Woman: Show your dad your new dress! Man: Look at you, sweetheart! Woman: Isn't she cute? Do you remember when I danced when I was little? Why do you ask? I was just thinking about it. Why did I stop? Well, honey, you weren't exactly a natural. We thought it best to put you in other activities that you excelled at. Yeah, but I remember it being so much fun! I mean, it didn't matter if I was good. Yeah, but you had a full plate with your academic schedule. You had to make some sacrifices and it served you well. Look where you are now! You're right. Mum: We should order. Dad: Mm! Hello. You came back. I was wondering if I could redeem those ten lessons after all. I thought you were busy. I'm going to make the time. (Phone rings) Uh... Sorry - one sec. Excuse me. Hi, this is Avery. Oh, yes, absolutely - I'll work on that tonight. Ok. Sorry. So, when is your next opening? I mean... I would have called, but... No-one answers? - Right. - You could leave a message. It's just not an efficient way to run a business. We do just fine, thank you. Little trade secret - no dance studio ever answers their phones, we're too busy dancing or teaching. It's not very efficient. I can take you in an hour. Efficient enough for you? Yes. Yes. I will grab a coffee and see you then. And, travel... travel the cha-cha. Good, good. Through... and finish. Great, that's really good. Just remember the posture at the end, the travel was great, I've got nothing else. - Thank you. - You did a really good job. I'll see you next time. All right. I've had a double Espresso - I am wired and ready. You can't dance in those. What do you mean? I walk all over Manhattan in these shoes. Well, that's walking, not dancing. There should be some practice shoes in the lost and found. See if any of those fit you. You want me to wear someone's sweaty dance shoes? You're welcome to put socks on. Oh, you mean the extra socks I carry in my clutch? Here. You can borrow mine. Are these clean? Hm. Happy now? - Yes. - Ok. You want to learn the waltz, I presume? - Sure. - Ok, well, we're going to start with the box step. - Oh, I think I remember that. - Great, good. Ok, well, the follower starts with the right foot, back, side, together, and then left, side, together. And repeat. Back... - Who's the follower? - You are. Why am I the follower? Because I lead. Why, because you're the guy? No. If you want to lead, I'm fine with that. Takes longer to learn and you said you were busy, but... By all means, lead away. Uh... Ok, i'm... I'm gonna be the follower. Thank you. Let's try dancing together, shall we? Now, take my hand. Ok, I'm just going to come in here. Right... good. This is your frame, ok? Keep your frame. Ok? - And, not too stiff. - But you said keep my frame. Yes, but you're like a corpse. I am not! Don't argue with the teacher! Ah! Don't anticipate. - You don't move until I do. - Ok. - Head to the left. - But... I can't see. I'm watching for us. Er, and I'm the one going backwards! Do you trust me, or not? Yes. It's just that if I'm gonna do this, I wanna do it well. And you will. Again. Head to the left. And... one... - Wait, no... - Sorry. Wrong... - It's ok. - Sorry. Sorry. - Whoop! - Sorry! - Oh, no, it's fine. Ouch. - Sorry... I can't, I'm just... I'm a mess. I'm rigid when I should be soft, I'm anticipating, I'm not waiting... My head's in the wrong direction... It's not about being perfect. In fact, it has nothing to do with that at all. Sorry. I don't know what I was expecting. (She exhales) Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. I'm fine, I just need a second. I'm sorry, I'm just, uh... Wow, I don't know where all this emotion is coming from. Now I'm crying in front of a total stranger and I'm just mortified. I'm gonna go. Avery, come on. Don't give up. I-I don't give up. On anything. But this is an elective activity, and I just... I don't do failure as a hobby, so... Thank you so much for trying. (Door slams) (She sighs) Of course, they're perfect. Hm! Receptionist: Abraham's and associ Avery, I'm so sorry about David. Thank you, but if you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it. Let's just focus on work. - Hey. - Morning, Avery. Great. Your ten o'clock is going to be late, so I moved your conference call to 11 and Bob asked you to pick out the company Christmas card. - The choices are on your desk. - Ok. Anything else? Yes. Would you messenger this to David at his office, please? Done. Thank you. (Doorbell rings) Merry Christmas! Yes, that is the smile I wanted to see! What is this? I'm bringing you some Christmas cheer! How did you even get this up here?! Your wonderful doorman! Help me get it inside. Let's put it by the window. Whoa! (They laugh) Ah! It's a really good tree, Molly. And I'm an expert - I was always in charge of picking out the Christmas tree growing up. Ah, my parents never trusted us kids to pick out the tree. Yeah, well, that's one of the perks that comes along with being an only child. - So how was work today? - A little weird. Darna's the only one who knows and... She's kind of tiptoeing around, trying to stay out of harm's way. Smart girl. - I had her send David's ring back. - You did? That's good! Now you have closure. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Hey, did you manage to get the refund from that dance school? You know what? I decided to take the lessons anyway. - I took my first one last night. - Really? Was it fun? No, I ended up walking out. Seriously? You are going back, right? Oh, no. No, no, no. It was an epic fail. Failing's just a part of the learning process. Doesn't mean you have to throw in the towel. Do you think I should go back and apologise? I don't know, how bad were you? I was... You know, a little difficult. I started bossing him around and I got frustrated and upset and I started crying and it was a mess, I was a mess. Yeah, an apology sounds like a good idea. All right. I mean, it's not like I know his schedule. Just pop over there for an impromptu chat. Sometimes life can throw you a curve and there's nothing you can do about it. You've just gotta roll with it - see where it leads. All right, fine. I'll go there tomorrow. Ok. Do you want to spot me while I go up for the crowning glory? It's very high! (They laugh) So close! Ah! Ta-da! Roman's in here. I accidentally borrowed these the other night. Oh. I won't tell! Thanks. - I'm not interrupting, am I? - No, no. They're almost done. Come on! In here. So amazing! - It's so good! - It's beautiful. It's amazing. - Avery. - Hi. Should I wait in the reception? - No, we're finished. - Yeah. I'm elina. Hi, Avery. That was amazing. That last move was outrageous! Yeah, it's like a... Flying pretzel! It's a work in progress! So, what brings you back? Avery said that she's sorry and she promises that she'll be a better student. Ah. Is that true? Did you say that? I did. So, you guys cool? Nicky, come on - let's go. Elina: Bye. Nicky: Bye! Bye! Wow, he is a pretty sharp kid. He is. Elina's a single mum, so he spends a lot of time here. What were you guys rehearsing? That was beautiful. Oh, we're dancing in the Christmas waltz - at the palace theatre. - Wow. That sounds like a big deal. Yes, it's very prestigious showcase for the studio. Elina was supposed to be dancing with her partner, but he decided to retire, so... I'm stepping in. Nice. Nicky and the other kids have a number, too. Ahh. That's so sweet. So? I'm sorry about my dramatic departure the other day. I was trying something new and it was more out of my comfort zone - than I expected. - So that's what that was. - Hey, I'm trying, here! - I can see that. Is there anything else? Yes. I was wondering if you would give it another go. (He inhales) I dunno about that. But... i-i... I bought proper ballroom shoes. Oh, well, that says something - those are Latin shoes, but, um... Oh, that's great. Course they are. Come on, then. Ok, so... Um, let's pick up where we left off. - Ok? - Yes. So... ..Here. Frame. - Head to the left. - Mm-hm. Do you remember, step back with the right foot, side, together. Ok. And, - one, two, three.. - Oh, sorry! You said right foot, sorry. - Yep, yep. - Can we do it again? Thanks. - You don't move till I move. - Right. - Remember? - Yeah, of course. - Ready? - Mm-hm. And... One... Ok, I don't think this is working. I know, i'm... I'm terrible! No, no, no, no. It's not you, you're not horrible. Uh... I have an idea. - Do you know how to ice skate? - No. Perfect. Change your shoes, we're going out. - Wait, out? Where? - To try a little trust exercise. The car is about five minutes away so I take it you know how to skate? I'm Russian, we're practically born on skates. Wait, I get it - I have to rely on you so that I don't fall? Exactly. Wait, if you're Russian, why do you have an English accent? I have an English accent? You... You know what? That's it. What? That's it. Wait, wait, wait. I went to school in London, I competed in Blackpool. Are you going to throw that at me? I don't know. I have to warn you, I have lightning dancer reflexes, so you won't be able to... Ooooh... You're in so much trouble. What? No! No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. Oh, yes - so much trouble. (She shrieks) Careful, it's a slippery! Ooh! Oh! Roman?! Are you ok, Roman? Please be ok. Can't see any abnormal eye movements. How's your head feeling? It, um... it hurts. Not surprising, given the size of the bump on your noggin. How's your vision? Any blurriness? - Seeing any stars? - No. What's your name? Roman davidov. How does the rest of your body feel? Fine. Good. Pull my finger. Er... Bad joke. Just give it a little squeeze. And other hand. All right. Let's get you up and see how your balance is. Ok. Thank you. Whoa... Um... I seem to have forgotten how to stand. Please don't tell anyone. I'm supposed to be - a ballroom champion. - Your balance should return. I'll let you go as long as your wife promises to keep an eye on you. Oh, that's me! Yeah! They would only let immediate family in here. - Oh. - I won't let him out of my sight. I suggest waking him up after about six hours or so. Ask him a few questions. If he's not slurring, he's good to resume normal activities by this time tomorrow. Ok. All right, then. - Then let's... let's go home, Roman. - Oh, anything you say, honey. Thanks, doctor. Stay in touch. Where do we live? Brooklyn. (Laughter) Aw, what a cute place you have. Thank you. Um, it's a bit of a mess, I wasn't expecting company. It's ok. Are... are you gonna be ok? - How are you feeling? - Yeah, I'm fine. Fine. Just... I know elina has to take care of Nicky, but do you have someone else you could call to keep an eye on you, like a friend, or a...? - Friend? - Yeah. Or a... Are you asking me if you I have a girlfriend? Yeah, no. I mean, not like that. I don't have a girlfriend. Oh... ok, well, the doctor said that you needed to be closely monitored, so I will, um... Come back first thing in the morning - and check on you. - No, that really isn't necessary. If you don't wake up, who's going to teach me how to dance? You do know that teaching you to dance is more painful than a concussion? I don't have a comeback for that. Fine! - Um, I'm gonna... - Sure. I... thank you, again. I'm sorry about the whole snowball thing. I guess that my lightning dancer reflexes aren't quite what they used to be. Well, I hope you get some rest. Go to bed. - Night. - Goodnight. Thanks. (Knocking) Roman! (Knocking) Roman? (Knocking) Roman? Hi. Who are you? That's not funny. You look ok. Wait - what's your name? You just yelled it three times. In fact, I'm pretty sure they heard you in the north pole. - Right. - You know, for a lawyer, you're not a very good interrogator. Ok, fine. Who am I, then? Avery - my wife. Yes, perfect! It is very early. It is. I'm gonna make you a coffee. Oh, no. You're one of those. What? A morning person. Yep! All right, so I have some eggs, and I got some power seed rolls, and I also picked up some wholewheat Pesto flatbread things because I thought you might seem like a breakfast wrap kind of a guy? No. Ok, how about an egg sandwich? You cook? - Why do you say it like that? - I don't know. I just thought you were more of a grab-and-go kind of person. I am, but what kind of nurse would I be if I didn't at least feed my patient? Hey, so... Do you have a toaster? Wow, look at this. I love the reindeer. Presentation is everything! I see you found my Christmas tree. Oh, I didn't realise it opened. Is there a story behind this? There is. When I was about 11, that awful age, when insecurity starts to creep in, I told my mother that I no longer wanted to be a dancer. It wasn't "cool". Huh. She didn't challenge me, but on Christmas day, she gave me this. And she said, "these are very special". No two are alike. Just like us. And we all have our hopes and dreams... ..And with those come the worry about what path to take. But all you have to do is look deep inside and ask... .. "Who do you want to be?" And you didn't quit dance. No. See, my mother knew that I had to work it out for myself. I love this little tree. I do, too. - (Oven pings) - Oh... Oh. Um... it's a little charred.. Um... Thank you. - Don't get too excited. - No, this is very kind of you. Good! Crunchy... I think I overcooked the egg a little bit. I... Yeah, sorry. Looks terrible. Could you just... Could you just walk for me, please, so I can get to work? But I'm eating. No, you really don't have to eat it. Just... just walk. Go ahead. No, can you just... Can you walk normally? (She giggles) You are impossible! Ok, fine - you pass the balance test. Hurrah! Ok... Should we reschedule my lesson tonight? Absolutely not. We are dancing. Ok. Avery, thank you. This was very kind. You're welcome. See you later. - Ah! Perfect timing. - Fancy meeting you here. Indeed. Good class, you guys. Hey, just a little bit more work on those rumba walks! There you two are! Roman, I'm mad at you. What were you thinking, goofing around on an icy sidewalk? We have a big show in a couple of weeks. I'm fine, thank you for... ow! That is a big lump. Yeah, keep poking it - that'll help. Don't be such a baby! - Well, stop touching me! - It was my fault. No, it wasn't your fault. Entirely. Ok, ahem, we've got work to do. Bye, elina. Oh, um... This is for you. You didn't have to do that. It's an early Christmas present. A thank-you for being so kind. She reminds me of you. Pretty, bright-eyed, and her smile is slightly mischievous. I love it. Thank you. Are you ready? Yes. But are you sure you're able to dance? I think I can handle a slow one. (Waltz plays) Don't look down. I'm here for you. I saw that. - Sorry! - Hold on a second. Now it's harder to see your feet. Ah, very clever. (Music: 'Ding-dong merrily on high') Two thumbs up on the cocoa card, Avery. Yeah, everyone seems to be enjoying it! Bob - this is for you. Thanks, this is very jolly. I thought the office could use a little Christmas cheer. Well, I'm about to add to your cheer. I want to put you on the allegro account. Really? That's, that's fantastic. Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you so much. - This is big, so... - I won't let you down. And we need it done right after Christmas. You got it. - Frank, can we go over that amendment? - Yep. Coming now. - Congratulations on the account. - Thank you! (Phone rings) - Oh, sorry... Roman, hi. Hello. Not disturbing you, am I? 'No, not at all.' I was just seeing if you were free this weekend? Um, you know, I'm not sure. Well, my parents have heard about the angel 'who nursed their son back to life...' well, I wouldn't go that far! 'Um, anyway, ' they're having a gathering at their house this weekend and they've asked me to invite you. That's so sweet - I wouldn't want to intrude, though. Oh, no, it's a... It's a Christmas party, so... - It's ready for signatures. - Oh, thank you so much. - Sounds like you're busy. - Could I look at my schedule and let you know tomorrow? Sure, yeah. Ok. Wait a minute, you said you'd check your schedule? - But you know you're available! - I know, but I'm not, emotionally. Oh! Is it a date? No. No, no. No, it's only very casual. - Then what's the problem? - I don't know. You're overthinking it! It's a Christmas party. Just go - meet the family, have a good time. Yeah, but I'm not used to big, social family gatherings. Avery, I know this has been a tough time, but Roman sounds like a nice guy. Go and spend a festive evening with some new people. It doesn't have to be any more than that. Yeah. I mean, I guess you're right. So you'll go? Yes! Yes, I'll go. Hi, can I get a peppermint latte, please? Me too. Ah! There she is. My star student. I brought you a gingerbread cookie. - Oh! - I have to confess, I was gonna eat it, - but I changed my mind. - Very christmassy. Thank you. You know, I wanted to talk to you about your invitation. Oh, look, I know you're busy. It's fine. No, I was gonna say that... I'd love to come. Really? Yeah, I think it'd be really fun to meet your family. Well, that's great. Ok. Remind me what lesson we're on? Uh, this is my fourth. Ok. How would you feel about learning some new patterns? New? No, I can barely keep up with what you've given me. - What are you afraid of, exactly? - I don't know. Ok. Baby steps. Let's begin with what you know, but with a different combination - in and out of it. Ok? Uh-huh. Good, good. Don't anticipate. And... One and two - that's it, yes. Oh! Hi, Bob. Roman: I'm liking the new partner. So am I! Roman: Back up... that's it. Great. Avery: Whoa... oh, wow! Um... excuse me, young man... All right, all right, baryshnikov - calm down, please! - Impressive! - Nicky: Ok! When am I learning that? Never! Fantastic. You are getting better and better. Thank you, coach. Are you still on for my family's party tonight? Yes, 7.00! Fantastic. I have to warn you, they can be a little loud. It's gonna be fine. Yeah. ♪ We saw three ships come sailing in ♪ on Christmas day on Christmas day... ♪ (laughter and music) (Loud chatter) Merry Christmas! Yes, merry Christmas! Wow! Welcome to the David whoa! This little monkey here, is my nephew. And over there is my nieces and nephew, down there, that's the extended family - oh, and over there, that's my father on the accordion. And my brother playing the mandolin. Merry Christmas, Avery! Hi, merry Christmas! Let's get you washed up. Sorry, it's a bit crazy! - Come on. - Avery! Hey, how you doing, Nicky? What's going on? It's 13 days till Christmas! Come on, guys - follow me! - Someone's a bit excited. - I can tell! So do your nieces and nephews also dance? Uh, no. It's too far a commute for them to get to Manhattan. I have been thinking about opening a dance studio here in Brighton beach, though. Oh, that's such a nice idea. Yeah, I have two teachers ready to go, with a built-in client list, and I have an investor interested, but he wants to see a business plan and... Oh, never mind. You know I could help you with that. Thank you. Er, red or white? White, please. I mean, it's a lot of stuff and... I'm an artist. Expanding the business is a whole other ball game. I'm sensing this is definitely a step out of your comfort zone. - Is it... is it possible you're...? - What? Are you afraid? Me? No. Don't look at me like that! Here. To our health. Cheers. (Loud chatter in background) Mm, come on - my mother wants to meet you. Oh, here. Just through there, to the kitchen. Mama! Roman! This is Avery. Hi, Avery! So you are the angel who took such good care of my boy! Oh, it was nothing. These are for you. - They're beautiful! - Can I help you do something? Oh, yes - come. Come, come. You can stir. I'm really not a very good cook... Just go with it. You'll be fine. Mama, what do you need me to do? - Turn the meatballs. - Got it. Ok. Try the sauce. Mm. Oh, wow. Yum! She loves your sauce, mama! Mm-hm! If you're nice to me, I'll sneak you the recipe. Wow, you would trust me with your family 's secret recipe? - Maybe! - Oh, Roman, the cookies! Stand back. Do you need this? Yep. No, I got this. If you come with me... ..Over here. Now, sprinkle them with sugar. Ok. Um... (Everyone chats) - There we are. - Oop! Sorry! - Angel wings! - I'm so sorry! I may have put a little too much! Just give it a good dosing, it doesn't have to be perfect! (Laughter) Here. A reward for a job well done. - Mm! - Roman! - Wow. - Bring the pot. The pot? Ok. Mm! You can bring the cookies. Ok, absolutely. Those are delicious. (Genial chatter) I'll get the other tray. - Mm, those look good! - Hey! It's really nice that you invited Avery. She fits in surprisingly well, don't you think? I was just thinking that. Is there something going on between you two? No, why? Maybe there should be. (All chat) That was crazy and amazing! A little bit different to what you're used to? - Oh, a lot different! - Ah! How many are there in your family? It's just me and my parents. Yeah. Christmas dinner is always at tavern on the green, and then we have a quiet exchange of ridiculously expensive presents at their penthouse. Just the three of you? Mm. - You must be close? - We are. Just don't feel like they're particularly thrilled with me right now, given the whole wedding fiasco. So, how are you faring in that department? Better. I guess I'm not feeling like such a failure. So that's what you're afraid of - failing. What could you possibly fail in, hm? Life, work? Dance? You don't worry about any of those things? Are you kidding? I question and doubt myself all the time. What do you say this Christmas we take a holiday from all of that? Hm? Just... Live in the moment. - Huh? Like... - Yeah. Like right now, we have music, and dance... ..And... ..Snow! ♪ Oh, the weather outside is frightful ♪ but the fire is so delightful ♪ and since we've no place to go ♪ let it snow, let it snow let it snow ♪ oh, the fire is slowly dying... ♪ - whoo! - Hup! ♪ And my dear we're still goodbye-ing... ♪ there we go! ♪ But as long as you love me so ♪ let it snow, let it snow let it snow ♪ oh, yeah... ♪ (they laugh) ♪ let it snow ♪ let it snow... ♪ hup! Man: Whoa! Man: Nice moves! You go! ♪ Baby, let it snow ♪ let it keep on falling down. ♪ (they laugh) (Man chuckles) - How much do I owe you, kind sir? - That's on the house! (He whistles) Your carriage, my lady. I thought evenings like this only existed in Christmas musicals. We can always live in our own musical. - Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. I am! So where's this Christmas glow coming from? Does it have anything to do with Roman?! No, it's too soon for that. We're just... We're just friends. Ok, whatever you say. This looks like your mother. Oh, that looks exactly like her. You are good! So, have you heard from David at all? No. Sorry, I shouldn't have brought him up. No, that's ok. My parents asked the same thing. How are they doing with all of this? We haven't really talked about it very much, but I'm making them dinner this week. - Oh, you're cooking? - Yeah. They're very brave, aren't they? Hi, I'll take this, please. - Ok. - All right, mum's gift done. Yay! Do we have time for hot cocoa? Absolutely! Always time for cocoa. - Thanks! - Thank you so much, - merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. Hi! - Hi. - Christmas shopping? - Yep! - I just got word they bumped up the deadline on the allegro contract to December 18. Yeah, that's this Friday. Yeah, I'm just putting it in my calendar right now. Are you up for this? I can bring frank on if you need help. No, no. I've got it. Are you sure? It's just... You seem a bit distracted lately. I understand you've had a little hiccup in your personal life. I... I did. But I'm past that, now. Glad to hear it. All right. I'll let you get back to work. (She sighs) (Women chat on street) - Hi! - Hi. I'm sorry I'm late, - just work stuff. - Not a problem. Do me a favour and call the studio number. - What? - Just call the number! Ok. Hold on. Let's see. Woman: 'Flurry dance studio.' hello, is Roman there? 'He's teaching at the moment, but I'd be happy to help you. - 'Would you like to book a...' - You can hang up. - You got a virtual receptionist! - Yep. We sold two private lessons and booked out Friday night's group cha-cha, all because of your brilliant idea. Oh! I'm brilliant, am I? Definitely. So, what's next? What do you mean? With your plans for the Brighton beach studio? You're really going to hold me to that, aren't you? Yes. You pushed me with my dance, so it's only fair. Have you looked at studios in the area to get an idea of rental cost? Not yet. Well, you should check that out. I'll think about it. Come on. You were a big hit with my family at the party, by the way. Ah, they were amazing! I have a favour to ask of you. Elina can't make rehearsals tonight and... I was hoping that you would go through the Christmas waltz number with me. Wait, do you... You really think I can handle that? Of course. You know most of the steps anyway and it would really help me. In exchange, I can offer you four wonderful seats to come and see our show. It's on December 20. I hope you're available. December 20. What is it? It was supposed to be my wedding day. I didn't know, I'm sorry. No, how could you have known that? Turns out I'm totally free. And I would love it. In fact, this is a really nice exchange. Thank you. Are you ready to try the number? Yes. This is a show dance, so, er... You can look at me. You said I should look to the left. You don't have to when you're telling a story. And what is the story? We can write it together. Great... Pull back. Keep out. And break. Keep going. Keep going with the arms. Ok. Yeah, that's great. Down... Out and then lean out. I get you back - back in... Like that... Yes. (She tuts) No. "Reach my..." This isn't working. (She sighs) (She sings a few notes) Everything good? Yeah! Yeah, I was just, um... I mean, I have three more days until the deadline, so... Well, I'm going home. Oh, wait - I'm supposed to be making dinner. I gotta go! - Goodnight. - Goodnight! Sorry about the take-out, I ran late at work. I understand. Your career keeps you busy. Yeah. It's a good thing dad's not here, cos I did promise him a home-cooked meal. Oh, I actually think it looks good. Oh, did you get my text about our Christmas dinner reservation? Yeah. You know, I wanted to talk to you about that. Instead of having dinner at tavern on the green, again, I was hoping maybe we could do something different? Oh? What do you have in mind? I don't know, something fun, something with live music or dancing. Don't you get enough dancing with all those lessons that you're taking? Besides, you know how your father feels about loud music. I know, but I just thought we could mix it up a little. Ok, how about this? Let's make a deal. We'll do dinner at tavern on the green if you guys will come with me Sunday night to Roman's Christmas waltz show. A waltz show? It'll be a fun night at the theatre. Let me discuss it with your father and I'll get back to you. - You promise? - Yes. It'll be nice to break out and try something new. Oh - soy sauce. You seem awfully busy this holiday. How are you fitting this all in? I mean, it's hectic, but I'm figuring it out. Well, don't lose sight of the future that you worked so hard for, honey. That's all we ask. I'm not, I promise. (Phone beeps) All right, let's eat. Looks good. - Smells good. - Yeah. Hi! Hey! What's all this about? Well, I'm following your advice and I'm taking a leap into the unknown, starting with spaces to rent for my dance studio expansion. That's so great. See? I said it. I'm facing my fears. This building is the first contender. It's a pretty cool space, and the price is right so I wanted you to be here to see it, as it was your idea. No, no, no, no - this is all you. I just want to see you realise your dream. I'm also working on my business plan. Do you have it with you? Later. Let's see the space first. Ok? So right now, they're using it for pop-up events - they're having an office Christmas party in here tomorrow. But wait till you see this. (She gasps) This is magical. Do you know what? This floor's pretty good! You want to try it out? Absolutely! (They laugh) You're getting pretty good! Thank you! At least I haven't stepped on your feet in the last week. - Let's try the flying pretzel. - What?! Come on, I'm taking a risk here! Oh, really? Are you trying to out-negotiate me? I am a lawyer, remember. Come on, just remember to kick your right leg. Ready? No! - No! - Ah! (She laughs) I'm so sorry! - Are you ok?! - Uh-huh. I wasn't ready, you said no! I know, but I changed my mind! Well, you have to give me a signal! Oh, I'm so sorry. I hit your eye. Did I poke you in the eye? - I think you just grazed it. - Ok. I'm really sorry! No more dancing - let's... Let's look at your business plan. I didn't mean for you to help me with that. No, I want to. You're just going to change it all. Let me see it. - Bring it here. - All right. So go to the second section, here. I think Nicky might have been playing on the computer. Ok. Let me just... I knew you were gonna change it. No, just a tweak or two. (Phone rings) Hey, mom! 'Sweetheart! 'Your father and I talked it over 'and we'd absolutely love to go to the dance show with you.' really? You would? 'Yeah, you're trying something new 'and we don't want to discourage that.' you know what, I'll drop the tickets off with your doorman. 'Sounds great.' - all right. Bye, mom. - 'Bye, honey.' David! What are you doing here? I've been trying to reach you. Um... Sorry, I didn't realise my ringer was off. Yeah, I came by your place yesterday, but the doorman said you were out. Where were you? Sorry... I don't have the right to ask you that. I was out helping a friend. A friend? He's actually my ballroom instructor. I'm taking the dance classes I got for our wedding dance. Dance classes? That's a bit unusual for you. Not really, I did dance as a kid. - I didn't know that. - David, this isn't a good time for a conversation. I know, I know. I'm sorry to bother you here. I mean, what's going on? I haven't heard from you in weeks. I know, I've been trying to just get things straight in my head. So you show up at my office and make this huge display? Avery... I am here because I want to fix things with you. The new branch is set up and I've asked my boss to let me commute from New York for a while. Oh, so our relationship is convenient now? No, it's not like that. But look, you have to admit, this does change things a bit. Right? For the better? Do you remember what you said the last time we were together? It was pretty hurtful. Believe me, I realise now what a huge mistake I made. And I don't blame you at all for being upset. I just want to let you know that I'm here, in New York. And I want you back in my life, if you'll have me. Look, you don't have to answer me right now. Ok? But please, will you just think about it? Just give me a call when you're ready to talk. Ok? - You all right? - Yeah. Sorry, he just showed up. He wanted to surprise you. I hope you're not mad? No, no, of course not. Is that for me? Oh, yes - it's the flurry studio business plan - you asked me to print out. - Thank you so much. I'll leave you to it, then. Ok. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven - keep going! (He clicks his fingers) Three, four, five, six, seven, eight - looking great! Five, six, seven, eight, jump - and in position! Hold it! Yes! Good job! I will see you at the theatre, six o'clock sharp, don't be late! Thank you so much! - Great job, Nicky. - Thank you, see you later! That's pretty impressive. Those kids really seem to be enjoying themselves. Oh, they love it. And it keeps them off their phones for a couple of hours. Can I help you with something? Oh, we haven't met. I'm David. - Avery's David. - Oh, I see. And you, uh, must be her dance teacher? That's right. Well, this is a really nice place you've got here. It is the only studio you have, or...? For now. I'm planning on opening another dance studio in Brighton beach. Actually, Avery's helping me with that. - Is she? - Mm-hm. Huh. Must be refreshing, for her to take a break from all her multimillion dollar deals to help you with your little business. - Sorry, I didn't catch your name? - Roman. I'm not sure what Avery has told you, Roman, but I'm back in Manhattan. She and I are trying to work things out. As you can imagine, she's a little vulnerable right now. I'm just teaching her to dance. Yeah, well. Those dance lessons were meant for our wedding. I'm aware of that. So I'd really appreciate it if you didn't complicate things. Like I said, we're just dancing. (Dancers chatter) Ok. I'll, uh... I'll let you do your thing, then. Hey, Nicky! How you - hey! I'm great. - Awesome. - Good job, guys. - Thank you. Well done. I'll see you again next week. - Yes, you will! - Absolutely! That was wonderful. Roman's great, isn't he? Man: Roman's the best! Hello! Do you have your shoes on? I do. Let's get started. Uh... This is my last class. - Yes. - And I... Would like to sign up for ten more. I just... Booked a new couple in the eight o'clock slot. So, um... Ok, uh... What about the seven o'clock? Or nine o'clock? I'll... have to check. What's going on? I'm sorry, I'm just a little preoccupied. Um... The investor wants to check my work before he makes a decision, so he's coming to the show on Sunday and it's a lot of pressure and I'm just... sorry. That's amazing! He's gonna be blown away! I hope so. Are you ready? - Ok. - Yeah. Head to the left. But you said this was a... This is a traditional waltz, so... Head to the left. ♪ Silent night ♪ holy night ♪ all is calm ♪ all is bright ♪ round... ♪ head to the left. ♪ ..Virgin mother and child ♪ holy infant ♪ so tender and mild... ♪ I can't, I can't... I'm sorry, I don't... i'm feeling kind of lightheaded. - Do you want some water? - No, no, no. It's not that, I'm fine. Are you leaving? I'm sorry, I can't dance right now. Avery, don't go. I forgot, I, um... I looked at your business plan and I fixed a few things, so it's ready to present. Avery, I... Just saw Bob. He said you haven't sent him the allegro deal. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Today is the deadline. You haven't finished it. Bob, I'm so sorry, it's not quite finished yet. I don't know what to say, I have no excuse. I don't need excuses, I need the executed documents. And I will have them to you by this afternoon. Ok. I'll tell the client we'll have it by end of day. Thank you. It's going to be fine. This has never happened to me before in my life. How could I let something this important slip? I've got to get it together. I'll grab my laptop - back in a sec. Thank you so much, darna. I can't believe this. Bob, I sent you the contract. Ok. I'll get it out now. I'm so sorry. As long as it never happens again. Of course. I'll see you after the new year. How was he? (She sighs) Well, he said, "I'll see you next year", so I guess I'm not fired. That was terrifying. Yes, it was. I wanted to give you this. It's your bonus cheque. Thank you. Merry Christmas, Avery. Merry Christmas. (She sighs) David, hi. - Hey. - Hey! Busy day? Huh. I can't even describe it. Well, I am very happy to see you. It's nice to see you, too. I was afraid the flowers were a bit much, though. They were a statement. Of how I feel about you. It's just a lot to process. The whole idea of you being back. What have you come up with? I don't know. I... honestly, my head is spinning. Well, let me help you get things back on track, then. Give us another chance. You know we make sense together. All you have to do is say the word. Let me give you the storybook Christmas wedding you've always dreamt of. So much has changed. This whole ballroom thing, you've been spending a lot of time with your teacher... Dance has been a lifesaver. And Roman has... He's turned into a very good friend. I'm sure he has been. Especially since he gets a free lawyer in the process. What does that mean? Just that he's pretty clever for a guy who can't figure out how to open up a second dance school! How do you know about that? Did you talk to Roman? I... I stopped by the studio. And what did you say to him? - Does it matter? - Yes, answer the question! I... I told him that I was back in the picture. You're not back in the picture. Avery, I did this for us. No. You did it for you. You did it to get what you want. What you always forget is, I have a choice in this, too. Come on. No. David, it's not going to work. I'm sorry, but... It's over. Goodbye. Roman, please answer. (He sighs) 'You've reached Roman davidov's voicemail. 'Please go ahead and leave me a message. 'Many thanks.' Elina. Hey! How did it go with the tailor? Were you able to get those tux pants fixed? 'Yes.' tux is pressed, fixed, and ready for showtime. What's the matter? Nothing. Really? You don't sound very excited. I found out that Avery is back with her fiance David. Are you sure? He came by the studio to tell me personally. Are you going to talk to her about it? Well... Nothing to say. You can't just let this go. Avery never even said anything about this. 'How do you know this David is even telling the truth?' well... It's not my place to get in the middle. 'Oh...' am I still collecting Nicky - 'on the way to the theatre?' - Yes, please. I'll come in straight from the salon. - That sounds good. - Roman... Maybe just think about what I said 'about Avery, ok?' ok. This is it, Nicky. The palace theatre! You made it to the big time. The stage is huge! You want to try it out? - Can I? - Go ahead. Show-off! Ahhh! This is just the beginning, Nicky. There are so many wonderful things ahead for you, young man. Come on. I'll show you to your dressing room. Thanks. Ah! It's snowing like crazy out there. Did I go overboard? Oh, no - you look amazing. Why aren't you dressed for the show? I'm having motivational problems. I saw David on Friday. I broke up with him. But I thought it was already over between you two? It really is this time. You know, he went behind my back and told Roman we were back together? And now Roman isn't taking my calls, and I... I just feel like I've messed up everything. That's because David's put you into another tailspin. You need to take control back. So, we are going to the Christmas waltz show, it is going to be inspiring and wonderful, and you can talk to Roman afterwards and explain - he will understand. Do you really think he will? Yes! But you have to get dressed right now, or we're gonna miss the whole thing. And you need to wear something fabulous, because I am teetering on the precipice - of being overdressed, here. - Never! (They laugh) (Horns honk) (Phone rings) Elina! 'Please tell me you're close.' I'm in a total gridlock. There's a truck broken down up ahead and... They've blocked off all the lanes. 'How are Nicky and the kids doing?' excited - they're warming up. Oh, that's good. (Horns honk) I don't know, Roman. 'I don't think I'm gonna make it.' stay positive. Keep me posted, 'ok?' wow. Now this is a lobby. - Aren't you glad we got dressed up? - Yes, you were right, of course! Ok, we just need to find the coat check and I'm sure my parents have been here for at least half an hour. Oh, there it is! Ok. - I'm so nervous... - Getting close, everyone. Getting close. Your investor's here. - Roman! - Hey! - How's it going? - Good - thank you for coming. I'm really excited to see your work on stage. The kids have been working really hard, I think you'll enjoy it. Oh, and... I've got that business plan for you. So... I look forward to checking it out. - Have a great show. - Thank you! Any news on elina? She just called and, um... ..It doesn't look good. - Hey, mom! - Ah, darling! You two look lovely. - Molly: Thank you. - Dad: Great seats, Avery. (Music: 'We wish you a merry Christmas') (Phone beeps) It's a text from Roman. What? It sounds urgent. I'll be right back. (Music: 'Jingle bells') Roman... Avery! - Oh... - Roman, what's wrong? Elina is stuck in a traffic jam. She can't get into the city. Well, how can I help? Will you dance the number with me? I... I mean, I... I don't even know if I would remember the choreography. I don't want to ruin this performance for you. You can do this. Avery, I believe in you. Ok. Ok. Dancers: Hey! (Whooping and applause) (Whistling) - That was awesome! - Hey, Avery! Amazing - Nicky, I am so proud of you. Thanks! Where's my mom? Let me just talk to him for a second. Your mum is fine. She's just stuck in traffic. Avery's going to dance the number with me. Ok. Ok. Roman, Avery - you guys are up after this. - Thank you. - Thank you. Avery, I'm sorry for the way I treated you the other night. You don't have to apologise. I found out that David came to see you at the studio. Yes, and he told me that the two of you are back together. That's a lie. We're not back together. You're not? No. And... We never will be, cos... I'm not the same person I was when I walked into your studio. No. You're a much better dancer. Well, I learned to... I learned to trust my partner. And your partner trusts you. Now, are you ready? I can't believe I'm saying this, but... Yes. I am ready. (Applause) It's Avery!
