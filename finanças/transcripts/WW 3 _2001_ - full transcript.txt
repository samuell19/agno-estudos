( dance music playing ) ( woman singing in Spanish ) ( men responding in Spanish ) ( Spanish singing continuing ) ( music continuing muffled ) Your move, Dr. Watson. ( laughs under breath ) Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm. ( pager beeping ) Seasickness or coronary? Aw, I've got a few people with the flu. Try not to cheat. Don't need to. ( music continuing ) Are you doing okay with that, ma'am? What's going on? I don't know. You should check this. Do you have any questions, ma'am? Is everything clear? WOMAN: Is this my insurance company here? Hello, Mr. Zelf. I understand you're not feeling well this evening. Mr. Zelf? Mr. Zelf? Is it your stomach? Does your stomach hurt? Yes. ( breathing uneasily ) I'm going to get you to lie down for me, Mr. Zelf. Okay? Swing your legs up. ( grunting ) Uh... I'm going to ask you to sit back up Mr. Zelf. Yeah, there we go. All right. Open your mouth, please. And open your mouth wider. I need help! Get Thomas and Mary now! Oh, sweet mother of God! ( birds chirping ) Let's move in there. Okay, listen up. Special Agent Sullivan, FBI. We have a search warrant pursuant to a court order. Please move away from your desks and into the hallway. I'm the assistant office manager, Kevin Poll. What's going on? It's insurance fraud, Mr. Poll. Here's the search warrant. We're seizing all the hospital's financial records. All of them? I wouldn't wait up. Please, out in the hallway. Uh, where's your television? It's in the, uh, cabinet. Over here? Yeah. Uh, what time is it, Peter? 4:56. It's in there. All righty, here we go. MAN ( over TV ): Reversing 11 years of policy since the Gulf War Russia today signed a formal treaty with Iraq reinstating the two countries' historically close relationship. Come on, change the channel. What are you doing? The game's on the other channel. Change the channel! SPORTSCASTER: Mike Conlin steps up to the plate. It's Chicago 5 and Florida 1. ( laughing ): 5-1! 5-1! Unstoppable! Can you believe it? They're going to sweep the playoffs. One more game, man! He delivers... and that ball is gone! Yeah! Yeah! It is going. It is going. It is gone! Home run! Chicago in the Series. It's the end of the world as we know it. Oh, I can't believe it. ( crickets chirping ) ( television playing indistinctly ) ( footsteps approaching ) ( phone ringing ) Hello? Yes, it is. What? Yeah. No, I understand. I got it. Yeah. Well, uh... I don't mean to be forward but I'd appreciate a hint of what this is abou... O'Hare, 2:45-- got it. ( chuckling sleepily ) Hey. I have to go to D.C. Why? I-I don't know. Plane leaves in an hour. I don't understand. I got to go to D.C. Plane leaves in an hour. They won't tell me why. How can they not tell you? By not telling me. But I got time off tomorrow. I cleared all my shifts at the hospital. We were going to unpack. I know, but right now, I got to go pack. Did they say when you'd be back? Well, it better be by Saturday. I've got those tickets to game four. Hey, do you know where that, um, the toilet bag thingy is? Someday, somehow, we're going to have to find the time to make this a home. What do you mean? This is a home. We have a mortgage to prove it. No, this is house with a mortgage. We have to make it a home with a mortgage. Uh-huh, and how do we do that? You know, by unpacking by putting up that mirror in the hallway by hanging up curtains and using this pepper shaker. Homes don't keep pepper shakers in boxes. They keep them on tables. Well, then we'll have to get a table. Exactly. Larry... there it is. Oh, there it is. Soon? Yes, soon. ( phones ringing ) ( voices speaking indistinctly ) Larry Sullivan. Hey. Hey, what're you doing here? I have no idea. Do you know what's going on? Well, did you change units? No, no, I'm HHS-- mostly medical fraud. You? DESC. DESC? What's that? Bio-terrorism, under directive 3-9-N-16. On October 6, 2100 hours, passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship American Anthem were taken sick by an unknown infectious agent. The ship was off the Mexican coast en route to San Pedro, California. Two people have died. The symptoms are flu-like followed by internal bleeding and convulsions. Initial findings suggest this may be a Marburg-type outbreak. ( murmuring ) What's Marburg? It's a very bad hot virus. It's not presently known whether this is a natural outbreak or a terrorist act. Coast Guard's quarantined the ship off Long Beach and CDC is taking care of the medical situation. Blake? Yes, sir? I want your unit in the air by 1300 hours. You're to head up Hazmat for the Western offices. You talk to Wilson about contacts and details. Yes, sir. And remember, there is no vaccine. There is no antidote. There's no treatment for Marburg. So be careful. Be thorough. This is the real thing. Let's not screw it up. Questions? MAN: Do we know how the virus...? Do we have one that works? ( overlapping speaking ) It's not doing us any good sitting in a lab in Aberdeen. If they got one that works, I want it onboard. What? Yes, I'm here to see Assistant Director Farrell. What do you want me to do? You want me to spray the crap out of a ship that's sitting two miles out in the ocean? Are you Sullivan? Yes, sir. Fine. Tell them I want to get back to them. Thank you. Gentlemen, can we have a couple of minutes here, please? Sir, when'd you want to contact Mexico City? Soon as I'm done here. MAN: We also need to contact the Federales and make sure we're on the same page... Fraud, huh? Yes, sir. So you're probably not too familiar with weapons of mass destruction? Not unless you're referring to HMOs. Do you know this man? Uh, yes. It's my uncle... uh, Uncle John. Are you close? Uh, not really, no. I haven't seem him in, uh... well, a very long time. Why is that? My mother and my uncle had a falling out after my father died. Did something happen to him? Yeah, he retired. Oh. From the Army? He lives on Bainbridge Island off Seattle. It's crucial that we talk to him. About what? Weaponization. This is a microscopic particle that the CDC took off the lung of one of the passengers who died. Question: is the particle a weapon? What do you need from my uncle? Don't you know who he is? Apparently not. Well... sweet ol' Uncle John personally invented most of this stuff. He worked with the Army's bio-weapons unit in the '50s and '60s until Nixon disbanded it in '68. We have a generation gap of knowledge. Men like your uncle, who truly know about military bio-weapons have all either retired or died. They're known as fossils. We sent an agent out from the Seattle office. Your uncle threatened to shoot him. Apparently, he has privacy issues. Good luck. Agent Blake? Yes. Donald Wells, CDC. This way. I'll take those, ma'am. Thank you. What's your setup? Looks like the interior of the ship is level four. We have a negative airflow and hepa filters in place. We've also bleached down all surfaces. Noninfected are confined to cabins. The infected are in public rooms under plastic tents. We're using the kitchen's refrigerators as morgues. The Coast Guard's running security. The Army's CBD Com has been flying in men and supplies. What's the dead? 33 and climbing. This is our level two. We suit up here. Welcome, Special Agent Blake, to the American Anthem ballroom. ( patients coughing ) Ship's doctor. Airborne? Negative. It spreads like the flu. Sneezing, coughing, touch... an exchange of bodily fluids. You know what introduced it aboard the ship? No, we don't. What's the CDC lab saying? Like Marburg, but not like Marburg. Could it be genetically altered? Could be anything. You don't! You're not in my position! You don't know how I feel! I don't even know if my husband's dead or alive! Why can't you call the ship? I already told you. They must have a passenger list! Yes, yes, of course they do. Well, then, who's in charge? Well, the thing is, I'm in charge and I'm in charge and I don't know what's going on, either. His name is Irving. Mark Irving. ( music playing ) ( woman weeping ) Excuse me. Are you Maria Cruz? Yes. And this would be Oakley? Mm-hmm. Is my husband all right? Um, do you know? Is he still on the ship? Yes, he's still on the ship. They're not letting anybody off at this moment but you can talk to him. Would you like that? Okay. Let's go. MAN: A lot of people are sick and some of them have died. Nobody seems to know why. All these doctors are walking around in these bubble suits like everyone's radioactive mutants. For God's sakes, stop crying. I'm going to be all right. I'm going to sail right through this thing. You watch me, girl. Okay. How's Oakley? He's fine. He's here. You want to talk to him? Yeah, yeah. Let me get him. No, listen, wait. I can't. Uh, the captain just... Oh, no. He's right here. Just a second. I'll talk to him later. Um... I'll be home sooner than you know. Oh, okay. I love you. Me, too. He had to go. The captain called. Edward Cruz, head of our security. Yes. I've been checking our passenger list against the CDC's list and I did come up with one discrepancy-- Hakim Sharif. He was traveling alone. He's no longer aboard the ship. Had a Lebanese passport. Where would he have gotten off? I don't know. The only place could have been Puerto Vallarta. I need to see all the information you have on him and I need to see his cabin. MAN ( over radio ) ...in Moscow today, the Defense Ministry continued its consolidation of power with the closing of two more opposition newspapers. In a speech before the Russian Duma, General Ivanoff pledged to restore the glories of the Russian Empire. And in baseball today, Chicago and... ( dog barking ) Who's out there?! I've got a gun! That you, Uncle John? It's your nephew Larry. Dunka! Dunka! Lawrence? Yeah. My God. You've grown. When did that happen? Uh, puberty. Huh. Well, quit playing games. Come on down. You're scaring my dog. What's that? It's in Arabic. Wardley will translate it. Take a look at this. ( camera clicking ) Tell me about the ship's air circulation system. I'll have to find the ship's engineer. I think he's pretty sick. Do you know where the intakes are? Some. You want to come with me? Your father and me in Germany. How's your mother? Fine. She remarried 15 years ago to an air conditioning tycoon. Lives in Florida. Uh, sends her love. Liar. She would just as soon see me chopped into fish chum. You, uh, married? Yes. Six months ago. To a doctor. Kids? Not yet. Hmm. So, uh... What's this about? Is this a Roots thing? Do you want to know that your grandfather was a mean drunk? Or that your great-aunt married a Chinaman and was disowned? Or, uh, is this about your father? I'm here because of your involvement with bio-weapons in the 50's and 60's. My boss... Your boss? I work for the FBI. And my boss wanted your opinion on this photo. This about that cruise ship off Long Beach? Yeah. How'd you know that? I may be a recluse, but I still have a TV. Mmm. Pretty work. You all right, Mr. Cruz? Yeah. I-I... I just need a moment. You wake up one morning, like any other morning you go to work... you breathe a little air and the next thing you know, you're a walking corpse. Well, you don't know that. I've seen the CDC's report. Two days from infection to your first symptoms and then another day or two after that to death. It's the hard math. I should have spent more time at home. I should have done right by my family. What is it? Who is it? Mr. Sharif. WOMAN: There's a phone call for you, Dr. Rosenberg. Hello? LARRY: Working hard? Slow night. How's it with you? It's okay. He's upstairs in the attic looking for some files or something. Oh, yeah? What's it like? It's like finding out you're related to Dr. Mengele. Ooh. When you coming home? Oh, I don't know. Hey, did you give those tickets to Timmy? No. The party's not till tomorrow. Have you unpacked anything? New plan. I'm thinking of a giant bonfire following our renunciation of all worldly possessions and an oath of poverty. Oh, very spiritual, but can we keep the TV? If you're good. I found it! Come on up! Well, listen, I have to go. I love you. I love you too. Bye. Yuri Zenkovsky. Yuri Zenkovsky. Who's he? An ex- biopreperate scientist. Bio what? Soviet bio-weapons lab. He made your powder. What powder? The one in the photo. Making a military bio-weapon's a lot more than just producing a virus. It's also how you deliver the virus. One way is by adhering it to a resin or powder. Microencapsulation. Makes the virus float in the air like dust motes. Well, that is, until it's sucked down someone's unlucky windpipe. And Yuri Zenkovsky made that? Definitely. Not the virus the powder. Yes. Very elegant. Well, we need to find out who made the virus. Yuri might know. Well, a lot of good that does us. Well, he defected to the U.S. after the Soviet breakup in '92. We... we could ask him. If we could find him. He, uh, he's been in hiding. Hmm. KGB? No. Visa. Visa? CIA gave him a credit card when he first came over. He was unfamiliar with the concept. Didn't realize that after you buy and buy you have to pay and pay. I, uh.... I haven't seen him in a few years but I know I have an address on him somewhere. This, uh... this stuff here. What is it? Oh, that's a brain virus. It's dead. Don't worry, it's harmless. It's used to test dispersion. Come here. Come on. I'll show you something. Oh, rain stopped. That's good. Can't have it raining. Bio-weapons... are useless in the rain. Let's see, winds out of the northwest, one to three knots. Slight inversion layer... You see that glow over the hill? Seattle. If that was real, I just killed, about... oh, one half of Seattle. 250,000 souls or so. Of course, uh, they won't know it for a few days. ( kids shouting ) JUDY: Abigale! What are you doing? Nothing. Oh, look at you. You're a mess. Here, blow your nose. PETER: Hey. I'm glad you could make it. Hi, Peter. Hey, Hela, why don't you take my clever little princess and get her some pizza. How about some pizza, Abigale? Oh, that looks great. Yeah. Hey, Timmy's been asking for you so I don't want him getting all jealous. Oh, you remember my sister Patty? Oh, hi. Of course. Nice to see you. You, too. How are you? Hey, Timmy. Timmy, it's Judy. Judy! Judy! It's the birthday boy! Well, I have a very cool present for you. You want it? Yeah! It's for game four of the playoffs. You can go with your father. What do you say, champ? I love you! And I you! Hey, look what I got! ( kids shouting ) Poor Larry. Stuck in D.C.? No. They sent him to Seattle. PETER: Must've killed him to give up those tickets. WOMAN ( over P.A. ) Mr. Sloan, come to the information desk on the Departures level. Mr. Sloan, please come to the information desk on the Departures level. Do you ever regret the research you did, Uncle John? No. Why? Because it's so deadly. Well, that's what weapons are, Larry. At least the good ones. This is just more repulsive. Than what, a bullet in the face? The dead don't complain, you know. Now, I personally find nuclear weapons repulsive. They destroy everything. Bio-weapons are, uh, they're kinder. They only destroy bioactivity. Bioactivity? People. Oh, come on. Don't you find the idea of using disease as a weapon somewhat... ghoulish? Was God ghoulish when he sent the plagues upon Pharaoh's people? You're not God. Oh, please. The Assyrians poisoned wells with rye fungus. The Tartars catapulted plague corpses over their enemies' walls. And the English, they sent blankets infected with smallpox to hostile American Indians. I did not invent the idea. No, you did not. But you perfected it, and you refined the weapon. Yep. Yep, I did. For God and country. Oh. MAN: No match on prints or visual match off the known terrorists list. We have his picture out to all our embassies. How did he get his hands on a Soviet-type bio-weapon? Can we track it? That's difficult. After the breakup of the Soviet Union so many of their scientists were recruited by other countries. Put somebody on that. Start with the obvious Syria, Libya, Iran, Iraq Osama bin Laden, North Korea, Pakistan... I appreciate it. All right, the CDC says it'll be days before the exact nature of the virus is known. It's a hemorrhagic hybrid. That's all they know until they decode the RNA. What do the Russians say? It's their virus. The Russians have denied any and all knowledge of a virus and if you believe CNN, they've closed their borders. I heard from a friend at the CIA they're picking up extensive troop movements in North Korea and Iraq. Wardley's ready? Yes, sir. ( phone ringing ) Can you get Colonel Walker's office? What's the situation on the ship? Out of the 1,564, 23 have died. Another 507 have symptoms and probably will die in the next 48 hours. God. It's a good thing he decided to hit a ship. At least that way, it was contained. I think he wanted to introduce the biological agent then have all the passengers go to their houses all over the United States before any major symptoms occurred. The death rate would have been a thousand times greater. Why didn't he? Well, the ship changed its last port of call from Mazatlán to Puerto Vallarta gaining a full day at sea, so we really got lucky. Did Sharif call anybody from the ship? Uh, he made three calls to a cell phone outside D.C. Can we trace it? We can triangulate if the phone's on but so far it's been off. All right. In the ninth inning, it is Houston three... Mr. Wardley? ...and Chicago two. Oh, sorry. Uh, I have it here somewhere. That Arabic document you found on the ship it's a fatwa, a religious decree. Decreeing what? Uh, standard stuff. A terror campaign against the United States for the desecration of holy lands in Saudi Arabia. Do you know who wrote it? Yeah. Al Qaeda, fringe organization in Afghanistan. You're sure? Quite sure. They were, uh, good enough to sign it. Here and, uh, here. It looks like it was imprinted in Pakistan although it could have been done in Kabul. I've seen a few like this before. It's consistent in text and style with the one Al Qaeda released just before the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. ANNOUNCER: And here's the pitch... and that's a ball just off the outside corner. Here in the bottom of the ninth inning Houston leading three to two. Chicago's got a runner on second. Guerrero digs in. The count is two and two. Two outs. And he's waiting for John Miller's pitch. I think Guerrero is going to wait for Miller to throw that change-up. Francisco's taking a healthy lead at second base. Oh, and that was almost a passed ball a very wild pitch from John Miller making the count three and two. And Tim Lee has called time out. He's going to travel to the mound to talk to Miller, try to settle him down. He's joined there by John O'Brien from third base. This sellout crowd of 63,000 does not want to give Miller any more time. Miller hasn't worked since game one and in that game Guerrero took him deep to left. ( organ playing &quot;Charge&quot; ) UMPIRE: Foul. WOMAN ( over television ): &quot;...that our actions today speak louder than words. There will be no sanctuary for terrorism.&quot; Hello? ...about 60 cruise missiles were launched from ships in the Arabian Sea under the cover of darkness. The target was identified by Pentagon officials as an extensive terrorist training complex in Afghanistan 94 miles south of Kabul. The President and his national security team link the site to Osama bin Laden the exiled Saudi millionaire. MAN: Hey! Terrorist experts say Bin Laden is responsible for... Can I help you guys? Yeah. FBI. Here to see Yuri Zenkovsky. Yuri, you old goat. Mr. Johnny Sullivan! ( laughing ) Such a surprise! Yuri, this is my nephew Larry. Larry's with the FBI. A pleasure. Likewise. So, look at you-- making aspirin. You've turned into a healer, you know. Yes, finally I've become a low-paid humanitarian. No wonder Sonia kicked you out. Mm-hmm. Oh, uh, Larry has a photo he wants to show you. It was taken aboard the ship with all those sick people. Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Yes, the encapsulation is definitely mine. Beautiful, no? The virus was made at Buchaparat near Kosovo in 1984 by Serge Kurbsky. This... is very, very bad. What is it? It is a Marburg influenza hybrid. Oh, my God, that's, uh, that's insane. Mmm. You... you'd just end up killing everyone yourselves included. We... they didn't think so. They consider the USA a deep target. The virus has a very short cycle. They thought... it will burn itself out here and with the borders closed it will never make it back to the motherland. JOHN: It was made as a tactical weapon to create a viral firestorm that would burn itself out in North America. Burn itself out? The virus. It would die when it ran out of hosts. Oh. Well, why would it run out of hosts? Because... it kills them all. Because this guy Serge Kurbsky invented it doesn't mean he has anything to do with it now. Bin Laden probably stole or bought the virus from the old Soviet stockpiles. Well, I don't know. Now, Yuri said that Serge married an Iraqi woman in the early 80s, and then when the Soviet Union broke apart they moved to Iraq, where later his wife was killed in a U.S. bombing raid over Baghdad. Now, how's that for motive? Larry. Huh? This is Serge. Oh, oh. Thank you. Larry? Larry? I'm sorry. What? I still don't see the connection between Kurbsky and Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Well, maybe there isn't one. Maybe the whole fatwa/Afghanistan connection was a deliberate misdirect. Maybe we bombed the wrong country. I don't know. Hold on. Do you have yesterday's paper? Of course. Just hold on. Hold on one sec. ( squawks ) ( squawking ) Who's this guy? This guy right here. I don't know. A friend, a colleague... Uh, listen, uh, I think I might have a make on your American Anthem suspect. I would seriously consider checking to see if Serge Kurbsky entered the U.S. ( thunder rumbling ) ( video game beeping ) Get ready. I don't want to go. Come on. They may have some new information. You may get to talk to your father. Don't you want to talk to him? No. Why not? Why not? 'Cause he's going to die. Don't say that! Don't you ever say that! It's what everyone says. Everyone doesn't know. Now, get your stuff. Your father needs us. For what? To be strong. To help him. He doesn't need us. Honey... just because he's gone so much doesn't mean he doesn't love you. We have to go. ( thunder rumbling in distance ) Fine. Stay. Fine, I will stay. Good. I don't have time for this. ( gasps ) ( crying ) I told you so. ( siren wailing ) WOMAN ( over P.A. ): Dr. Campbell, report to Emergency stat. Dr. Campbell, to Emergency stat. Tell me if this hurts. Is she going to be all right? I'm going to have another doctor take a look. Could you wait here? Thank you. Peter. What are you doing here? Judy, hey. It's, um, it's Timmy-- it's his stomach... Sweetie, does your stomach hurt? Do you think you're going to be sick? Here. You got him? Sweetie, it's all right. It's okay. We're right here. Yeah. You can go right here. There. You feel better? Peter, will you wait here with him? I'll be right back. Is Dr. Krystof around? MAN: In X ray. Excuse me. Dr. Krystof? Dr. Krystof, please, I've got a problem. I have two patients with signs of the alert. I may have three. Where's that CDC memo? Station. ( quietly ): Oh, God. We're filling up with patients. Flu symptoms and stomach pains. What's going on? Working on it. Sweet Lord. Are we in trouble. 48 hours from infection to symptoms. Two days ago. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, God... I know this sounds strange, but by any chance did your mother recently go to a baseball game? Yes. She's got season tickets. She's a big fan. Wait for the doctor to come. Judy. Now... a tactical weapon would have delivered the virus in four locations: here... here... here... and here. Simple, no? The virus amplifies itself through the population cough by cough until, of course, finally the population crash. Mr. Zenkovsky, I don't understand. We got hit in L.A. and Chicago and indirectly in Houston but if this is a planned, coordinated attack why haven't they hit us on the east coast? Not just the east coast. Must be Washington, D.C. to take out military and political infrastructure. Fine. Why haven't they hit us in D.C.? Well, let's see. What is the Weather Channel? 47. Thank you. Excuse me, please. MAN ( over TV ): A strong storm will continue through the Atlantic states bringing heavy rain... Ah, rain. No good for bio-weapon. Bio-weapons hate the rain. High winds, daylight. Sir, the director needs to see you. He's in your office. Excuse me. SULLIVAN: So we need to find out when that rain's going to clear up. Sir? So, it's official, Eric. We bombed the wrong people. Well, I'm sure they deserved it for something. Anything on Kurbsky? We know that he came into D.C. through Beirut two weeks ago. We'll get him, sir. I'm heading over to the White House. The Security Council's going into permanent session. I want you to give me a full report on that at 0600. I'll be ready. Sir? Yeah? There are a lot of rumors flying around. The JCS and the CIA think that Kurbsky may be working for or with the knowledge of the Russian military. That can't be right. Why? Since the election, it's been a political nightmare. The Communists and the Nationalists control the Duma. No one controls the military. Look at the sequence of events: the proliferation of a bio-weapon by a Russian military scientist; the early closing of the Russian borders; the stonewalling of any information connected with the virus; and finally, the Russian military on high alert possibly providing protection for Iraqi troops moving toward Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. For what... for what purpose? First step for a new Russian empire. That's insane. Absolutely. But the question is-- is it true? ( men talking indistinctly ) MAN: Yeah? Who is it? FBI. Have you seen this man? No. Never seen him. No? What'd he do? Nothing. Yet. Sorry to bother you. Larry... LARRY ( over phone ): Ah, fine. Listen, I've been going crazy. Are you all right? It's chaos; hundreds are coming in. We're totally overwhelmed. It's-it's horrible. Judy, listen to me. I want you out of Chicago. Now, I've arranged transportation... Don't be silly. I can't leave. Well, you can't stay. The fatality rate is near 100%. Once you get it. Everyone who's been exposed to the powder has gotten it so you got to get out of there right now. Well, the powder's long gone. It's spreading its disease now. There are precautions. Judy, I've arranged to get you out of there, okay? Larry, listen to me. I'm staying. It's my job. Jude, listen, I understand what you're saying. I understand it's your job. But I cannot bear the idea of something happening to you. I'm fine. Don't worry. You taking all the precautions? You doing everything you need to do? Yes. We know what we're doing. How is Peter and Timmy? Not good. And Abigale? I think the nanny took her over to Peter's sister's house. Have you, uh... have you unpacked everything at the house? No. I can't seem to find the time. Judy, come on. Let's go. I got to go. All right. I love you. I love you, too. You all right? Yeah. I'm just worried. Judy's in Chicago at ground zero. Well, if I have any extra time, I'll check up on her. You going to Chicago? The Chicago police have a suspect. I'm heading out to question him. Good luck. Yeah. Hey, thanks. LARRY: What sort of man would knowingly kill thousands? In my experience, exceptionally normal ones. Hey, you don't think that if you looked into his eyes-- I mean, you really looked-- don't you think you'd see the eyes of a madman? ( chuckles ) I doubt it. You don't think much of humanity, do you? Not really, no. Neither does your virus. Oh, it's hardly mine. Marburg has a good mind of its own. Where's it from? The Kiddam Cave in Northern Kenya. Why do they call it Marburg? Marburg's in Germany. Why don't they call it Kiddam? It's always named after the town that had the first outbreak. Marburg? An infected lab monkey was shipped from Kenya to a research complex at Marburg. People got sick. What year was that? 1968. That was the year my father died. That's correct. So he wasn't working for the judge advocate general? No. Army intelligence. Yeah, see, I... you know, I'd heard that around and it sounded true. Your father was sent to Marburg to collect a sample of the virus for our lab. Did he succeed? Oh, uh... in a way. He got sick. That's what killed him. The heart attack story was just a cover. That why my mother hates you? In part. What's the other part? I took a piece of his liver back to Virginia to cultivate the virus. Your, uh... mother considered that in poor taste. I haven't always done what's right. I know that. But, uh... I loved my brother very much. Your mother never forgave me. And I should? MAN: We just got lucky is all. He tried to leave the stadium through an illegal exit. Mmm. Guard told him he couldn't go that way he started swinging at him. So they tussled, and he was arrested. He would have been released but he wouldn't speak, so we couldn't I.D. him. Didn't say boo. Some of the boys down here can be pretty persuasive. Look, um, you should know that he's showing signs of the disease. I have a suit. Even with a monkey suit you're a braver man than me. ( door closes ) We know who you are, Mr. Hamdoon. We know that you were a professor in Baghdad that you speak English that your sister and your family were killed in the bombing of your city. We know about Dr. Kurbsky and the bio-weapon and your colleague and the cruise ship. You want to see a picture of your colleague? Oh no. Don't turn your head. There's more. There is more. Hmm. Antonio, Jose. Carpenter, dead. Avery, Sharon. Grandmother, dead. Baumgold, Celia. Businesswoman, dead. Habib, Malik. Veterinarian, dead. Franchesky, Eve. Pregnant, dead. And dead. Oh, there's more. There's-there's hundreds. There's thousands. And now you're dead. How does it feel to be dead? I can see the gates of Heaven. I need to know where Dr. Kurbsky is. Tell me where Dr. Kurbsky is. Where's Kurbsky? Tell me. Kurbsky-- where is... I'm okay, I'm okay! Just get him! ( labored breathing ) KRYSTOF: Judy? Judy? Oh... oh, my God, I'm so sorry. It's all right. There's so much work to do. We could all use a catnap. JUDY: Timmy, sweetheart. He's dead. I just checked him. Did you know him? Um, yes. That's his father. He works with my husband. I'd be surprised if he regained consciousness. Probably better that way. Does he have any more family here? No. His wife passed away two years ago. He has a little girl, Abigale. She's at his sister's house. I'll put in the order. I'll do it. I want you to go over to the Federal Building. The Army and the CDC have converted the underground parking into a massive field hospital. Well, what do you want me to do? Beg for supplies. MAN ( over TV ): In a bold attempt to isolate the virus and to prevent it from spreading the president has ordered the citizens of the United States to remain in their homes. Rioting has been reported in Chicago, Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Diego. On the international front Iraq has continued to move its army towards the Saudi Arabian border, and the United States is sending arms and supplies to reinforce that border. What do you think the president'll do if Iraq goes into Saudi Arabia? I don't know. It's pretty hard to send ground troops to the Persian Gulf when they're all busy in the streets trying to enforce this curfew. Probably bomb 'em back to Babylonia. And the Russians? The Russians are going to back down. They have to. Let's hope they don't apply the same logic to us. That's World War III. Okay, it's coming up on the main board. Courtesy of the CDC. Now, this projection doesn't include American Anthem, which was contained or the possibility of another nut out there with another weapon. Okay, here's four days ago. The Chicago release. 52 hours after that, these are the cities that were infected. As of the present, here are the cities that have been infected. And here's our best prediction for seven days from now. FARRELL: So what are they saying that we're all going to die? No. Only about 25%. The good news is, if we don't sustain another bio-hit our political, military, and economic infrastructure will survive and recover. And if we do sustain another bio-hit? I don't know. Do you know where Dr. Rosenberg is? No, I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Hey. Larry said you might come by. How are you? Well, you know. What's it like out there? Oh... it is like Ecuador after a bloody coup. I mean, the streets are empty. Army everywhere. People rioting, trying to get the hell out of the city. Most people are holed up. Many dead? Well, there's a full-time fire at the landfill. And you? How are you doing? Uh, I heard that you have a test to check for the virus. Yes, we've been using it to screen medical personnel. Can you test me? Is there any particular reason? I have a confession to make. Mm-hmm. I never got you guys a wedding present. You have a year. From the wedding? Mm-hmm. Oh, great. The shops are closed. I thought I'd have to go out and loot something. You'd loot for us? That's so sweet. Omega 27? Larry Sullivan, please. M.J. here. Yeah, I'm at the hospital. She's sitting right in front of me. Looks good. She always looks good. Yeah, you should know that Abdus Hamdoon died in prison before we got any information out of him. Uh, I'm going to be here for...? Two hours. At least another two hours. Yeah, okay. Hold on. You want me to go for a walk? No, no. You wait here. I can get it outside. Hey, honey. LARRY: Hey. You all right? I wish you would stop asking me that. I feel fine. I'm sorry. It's just hanging out with my uncle all week I've come to realize how important family is. Especially the ones who aren't blood-related. Everybody feels that way about their family. No. Not everyone has my family. Lar? Yeah? Do you know how much I love you? How happy you've made me? How much it means for me to be your wife? Honey... i... is something the matter? Besides the whole damn world? Judy... Larry? ( static ) Judy? Judy? Larry? Judy! Judy! It's the entire Chicago system. He said &quot;Think about it. How does it know?&quot; Okay. It's going to be dark in three hours. The rain is letting up. I need your help. Shoot. If you were Serge Kurbsky what would be your target in the city? Well, he has a fat ego. I say the president. Okay. The White House. Let's assume that. Now, where would he have to be to release the powder? Well, he'd have to be high above the city. Then you'd have to know how the powder drifts. Rate, spread, dispersion. You know that, don't you? Please, I wrote the book. You'd also have to know the weather conditions. Well, this was planned months in advance so how would you predict the weather that far ahead? You'd have to look back a few years to conditions in the month you wanted to release. Winds, inversions, temperature-- take an average. Courtesy National Weather Service. Let's go find him. MAN ( over TV ): 22 are now confirmed dead at the Arlington Memorial Bridge. Over 200 people, ignoring the curfew had gathered at the bridge in an attempt to cross into Virginia. After failing to disperse the crowd with tear gas the National Guard fired live rounds into the crowd. Has to be more east. What, you don't believe me, no? No. You're using the best case. We tested it 20 years ago. It was just not that impressive. Oh, well, yes. Back in the Black Ages. But some of us continued to work, no? Continued to perfect. I've seen your perfection; I still say east. ( speaking Russian ) Oh, up yours! Shut up! Shut up!! Just shut up. Now, can you both agree that we're close? Close, yes. Definitely close. ( speaking Russian ) ( dialing phone ) Yeah, Sullivan here. We're going to set up a general surveillance on 16th and M. All right. I'm going to go have a look around get familiar with the area. Look around? What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait to breathe something nasty? This crazy. ( sighs ) I'll, uh... I'll talk to him. JOHN: Hold on! Larry! Wait a minute. You know he's right. There's nothing for Yuri and me to do here. There's nothing for you to do. Yeah, we're going to wait. We're going to wait and we're going to see. For what? I don't know, but being in a shelter with our heads up our asses isn't going to do us any good. Neither will vomiting up blood. I don't care. Oh, I see. That's it. You want to punish us. You want to punish me. It's an ugly world, Larry and we're an ugly race but if making me the big bad man helps, you go right ahead. Join the crowd; blame Uncle John. I had a life. Now, I don't know how much is left of it and you're right, I probably blame you for that. I blame you for my partner's death and the death of his little boy. I blame you for my father, a man I never knew. But if anything were to happen to Judy-- the person I love more than anybody in the world-- I'd blame you so much, I'd probably kill you. Now, I want you to go back, sit in the car with your buddy and wait. And God willing, there's something to do we'll do it. ( car door opening ) ( car door closes ) Just shut up. Just sit there and keep your damn mouth shut. WOMAN ( over P.A. ): Dr. Temple, report to O.R. Dr. Temple to O.R. I'm ready. You're infected. ( sighs ) Oh, what a stupid way to die, huh? There's always a chance the test is wrong. There's a chance you could beat the odds... Judy, come on. I know what the odds are. I've seen up close what this virus does to people. ( sobbing ) ( sniffling ) ( sobbing ) ( voice cracking ): It's all right to cry. ( crying ) Crying's okay. ( sniffling ) ( whispering ): Come on, let's go, come on. All right, I'll see you later. Okay, bye. ( door opens ) Where have you been? Out. Get back here! You must be crazy. Do you want to get the sickness? What is that? What? That. Nothing. Show me. You could have been shot. Batteries! You would get shot for batteries?! Are you stupid? What are you going to do with those batteries? Trade them. For what? Food. We don't need food. Medicine. They'll give us those things! No, they won't. In Chevy Chase, they will, not here. They'll let the sickness come and let us starve. They hate us! You're crazy. That's what everyone says. That doesn't make it true! But they say the politicians and the rich people are moving to Virginia. That Virginia is clean. So you think a little river is going to keep Virginia clean if D.C.'s dirty? Go to your room. Go. Listen to music. Go be a boy. You know how they died? You know how Dad died? Your guts split open inside of you and you start to bleed to death. You just want to sit here and wait to die just like Dad did. Where are you going? Out. Get back here! Don't go... Oakley! Don't go! Oakley! Oakley! Oakley! Oakley! Oakley! ( people moaning and coughing ) Hey! You're not supposed to be in here. FBI. It's your funeral. Let's go. ( gunshot ) DOCTOR: We're doing everything we can. WOMAN ( over PA ): Dr. Williams, report to Emergency, stat. Dr. Williams to Emergency, stat. ( woman whimpering ) Hi. Do you remember me? I'm Peter's sister, Patty. Yes, of course, I do. Do you know about Peter and Timmy? Yes. How do you feel? It's.... it's about Abigale. Is Abigale sick? The nanny, Hela, was supposed to bring her to my house but she never did. I think Hela thought that Abigale was infected. So Abigale is still with the nanny at Peter's house. No, I don't think the nanny's there anymore. You think Abigale is alone in the house? Promise me you'll find Abigale. Promise me. ( dog barks in distance ) Hello? Abigale? Sweetheart? It's okay, honey. ( dog barks in distance ) Sweetie? Abigale? Love? It's all right. Abigale. ( helicopter flies overhead ) ( dialing beeps ) WOMAN: CNN. How may I direct your call? Hello? CNN? Yes? Good. It is Serge Kurbsky. I want to talk to the reporter Robert Poll, please. CNN is reporting that Kurbsky has the Marburg Influenza biological weapon and is giving the residents of DC four hours to evacuate. Old trick, huh? He wants as many people on the street as possible to increase infection. WOMAN: Hurry, let's go! ( people shouting ) MAN: Come on! Come on! Come on! David, David! Come on! Come on! MAN: Get out of here! Let's block off down there! 34th and M! We got the trace! Let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! ( car horns blaring ) MAN ( over bullhorn ): Return to your homes! There is a curfew in effect! You will be arrested! Return to your homes! Return to your homes! There is a curfew in effect! You will be arrested! ( people yelling ) Come on! This way! Stay away from the barricades! We will open fire! Stand back! Stay away from the barricades! We will open fire! Stay back! Let's get out of here! ( crowd chanting ): We want shelter! We want shelter! We want shelter! Come on! Get out! Wake up. Wake up, Noel. Don't die on me, please. 6876 M Street. Yeah, it's a block away. They got a trace a block away. Hang tight. ( helicopter flies overhead ) FBI. Have you seen this man? No! FBI. Have you seen this man? Have you? I think so. I... Where? I think he rented Tom's place. Top floor. Number 43. ( heavy sigh ) ( helicopter flies overhead ) FBI! Freeze! Put down the container! Put down the container! Get back! It's a bomb! It's a bomb! Get away! ( crowd screams ) Did it crack open? Is not broken. We live, no? For now. ( grunting ) Mom, I missed you, Mom. Hey! Hey, hey! Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Congratulations. FARRELL: Sullivan. Good job, good job. God bless America! ( all cheer ) Zenkovsky just arrived. Wait. What are you saying? Where the hell are the backup generators? Doesn't anything work in this damn place? Maybe we should hold a seance; find out what happens next. AGENT: They've done it. Iraq just crossed the border into Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are rolling over. Have we responded? I-I don't know. What about the Russians? I don't know. I'm still trying to call Chicago. So when are the lines going to be operational? Well, who the hell would know? It might take a while. There's nobody left to maintain the lines or man the boards. Do you have any communications? Short wave. Okay. I want to get hooked up with my wife. She's at Metropolitan Hospital. I want to get hooked up with her right now. Metropolitan Hospital is shut down. She won't be there. Uh, a message to M.J. If I can get a message to M.J.... No. She's dead. I'm sorry. Is there a flight? Anything? A military flight? The whole place is shut down to air traffic, Larry. Back to the hotel? No. Home. Chicago. Did you hear, uh, Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia? Mm'mm. So what will you do? Oh, I thought I'd stick around DC help out if I can. I know you can. ( elevator bell dings, door opens ) Hope she's okay. Thank you. ( turns radio on ) ( garbled static ) Judy! Judy... Judy... Judy, darling. You're all right? Hmm? Yeah. Abigale had the flu, but we're fine. Captioning sponsored by 20th Century Fox Video
