Eiichi! Eiichi! Get up! There's a fire! Fire! What'll we do? Wind's blowing that way. Look, this is a fire-proof building. I’ll go and see. No you don't. Please get me my sweater. Won't you come too? Silly. What if you get hurt? The wind's changed. The wind's changed! Naoko! I don't hear any fire engine. They don't know. I’ll phone 110. - You win. I’ll come too. - Really?! It's not 110. For fires, it's 119. Really, that rag-picker's place... never noticed it before. Can I go along? ''CHILD SLEEPING DON'T PRESS THE BUZZER'' - What is it? - Is this your child's? I found it in the ruins of the fire. I’m Mrs. Ishikawa in Apartment House No. 10. I’m Mrs. Nakada. It's Toshio's. Thank you. Is anything wrong? Yes, he went to play in the ruins, and stepped on a nail. He had sneakers on, but... That's begun again. Listen, I’m sorry, but can you do me a favour? Will you do me a favor? Listen, in that apartment house... .. someone's sick. Will you go a little farther away? Thanks. Oh, wait, wait! May I have one too? Thank you. Two? Thank you very much. Wish we dared, but it's hard to ask. She was repatriated as a child. Had a hard time. No wonder she's so polite. I was spoiled. I still go home for money. You're lucky. She was an orphan. She was? The electric train's coming! Have to sleep outside again. But I’m glad you weren't hurt. He came to Tokyo last year. Doesn't look it, does he? From Nagaoka? Yes. His family farm's full of holes. His father's looking for natural gas. A likely story. I don't mind. I guess I won't. - One more. - Half a cup. All your fault. Same shoulder width? A little taller. - Me? - No. The cine camera's at the office? Don't move. I saw the strangest man today. A ragpicker. Strange? Why? Why? I think I’ve seen him before. - How do you do? - How do you do? Isn't burning things a chore now? Can't leave things outside. A ragpicker took something I wanted fixed. Even a junkman would pay 50 yen. More, I’m sure. They're finally putting up a fence. A fence? Before the ragpickers' huts. Hear the Nakano boy got hurt? How is he? The laundry boy got the wash dirty again. Fight! The enemy's got no guns! A nice gun. Stop it! Stop it! Don't! Stop it! Not fighting. A new game. A new game? I see. Then don't forget about rules. Understand? Obey the rules. You'll be the judge? I’m umpire. Don't forget the rules. Now choose sides, understand? Divide into sides. No, no, do as I said! Don't do anything dangerous! Don't throw sand! I’ll be blinded! You broke the rule! Anybody home? Laundry man. My blouse? Day after tomorrow. Account book? Anything wrong? Here. I’d like to live like this after I marry. Lots of better places. Hard doing business here. Why? Hard to enter. Thank you. It's against the law to build here. Don't be stubborn! Better luck next time. Excuse me. Are you... Ikona-san? I’m Ishikawa. Mrs. Ishikawa. It's been quite some time. Five years ago, wasn't it? We met the other day. I live at the apartment house No. 127, 3rd floor. My husband returns at six. He's home all day on Sundays. Please come over once. The smell... can't it? So much trash. A fence here would do, I think. From here to over there would be enough, I think. I think you'd find it convenient. Something must be done. You won't be angry, will you? Flood donation again? No, it's not that. Tell me. Promise you won't be angry. I won't. I lost my brooch. Is that all? It was your birthday gift, with the pearls. Silly. But... Nothing else? Oh, but there is. The pin you lost? No. What then? Mr. Ikona. An odd name. I remembered it. My University classmate. I told you I saw a strange ragpicker? It was Mr. Ikona. He's at the ragpickers' huts with an awfully big dog. You're not surprised? Very. He's like my uncle who died at sea. Baseball? Pitcher? Cows? I feel sorry for them. A thorough check is very difficult. A hotel? Palace Hotel. Cabinet Minister. Section Chief?. Department. We Section Chiefs get caught in the middle in a scandal. Oh Eiichi, you're... You're laughing. Wait your turn! You! Some people! Apartment house dwellers don't ride together? I think the Tomizawas are hiding a dog. Doesn't the manager know? Hanako! Hanako! What's the matter? - Hello - Hello. Is Ishikawa-kun well? Is she your child? My daddy and mommy are gone. Nobody knows where. Is that your bird? Found it at a work place. My husband says he only saw you once at Shibuya. Sing me that song again. Don't use our paths for your work. You're even stingy with your paths? Putting up a strong fence soon! That's mine. I see. I’m sorry. Thank you for the other day. Nice clouds out today. Just like a camel. Please, a cup of water. Third floor. Long way up. Your dog too? Will water do? That was good. Nothing in the house but biscuits. Thank you. No wind comes in. When'd you move in there? Well, I’ve been here a long time. Let's see, when did l? Kuma! The Kaneko's cooler, 30% discount. Buying ours on installment. Any free service then? For the ragpickers. It's no good. Oh, why? It's all scrap to you, but to us there are many kinds. Can't use this. Give it to the ragpickers. Can't be sold. Can this be sold? 60 yen, I guess. Too cheap. Do your bit, pay more. We're raising money to build a fence. Something strange here. I already bought them. Show me that cup. What for? The one from your foyer? Yes, my husband won it at a mahjong contest. Was it stolen? Where did you buy it? From a ragpicker. What did he look like? You know, the one with the big dog. Not too hot? Listen... My underwear. What is it? The trophy was gone. The one in the foyer. Why? I said Ikona-san came yesterday, didn't I? It was stolen? Careless of me. You didn't notice it, either. I was so surprised today. Found it in the junkman's cart. He said he bought it from a man with a dog. Eiichi-san. Eiichi-san. I heard you. I’ll go see him. You will? I’d better see about it. My trousers. Ikona-kun? Ikona-kun? I’m Ishikawa. Hello. What's up, today? How about a drink? I’m Ishikawa. How do you do? Professor Nagai died. Two years ago, I think. Know that? No, I didn't. A little talk... Don't misuse my wife's kindness. It's about the cup. You took it? I hate to say so, but you stole it. No. No? I didn't come to blame you. I want to talk to you quietly. Please, let's go home. I’m amazed. A university graduate! Get out! Get out! You're mean! Never mind then. I thought we could talk. It's no use talking. Please understand. You do, don't you? Anyway, we'll talk outside. Your dog... It's mean, saying I stole it. I found it. You found it on the clog box? I found it. It's all right. It doesn't matter. I’m so upset! You mean I am! I really don't mind. So don't worry. No, it's in your eyes! You suspect me! Did you come to apologize? Then apologize properly! Are you so angry? Anyway, come in and talk. Come in! Ikona-san! A cup of water. Go home. Wait a minute. All right. Mrs. Ishikawa, please understand. Kuma. Kuma. Your paws are all dirty. Ikona-san. The cup was stolen. Excuses won't do. It was stolen. Wait, please listen. You should apologize. Wait! Wait a minute! Hanako won't like gifts bought with stolen money! It's not right to steal, Ikona-san. You know that. That trophy. That belongs to us. You've got me all confused. Kuma. Kuma, let's go home. Still bothered about Ikona? I think we should find him some other work. Why do you say that? Is there some better work for him? Perhaps. I doubt it. But I understand how you feel. It's like you. Not today. I’m troubled. He upsets me. What's it going to be? A fence. Now don't bother us. I miss those days. This picture of you. What's this? Students' settlement. Always doing something. On the repatriation ship, we looked after babies. Ikona worked hard then. Ikona-san's taking care of a blind girl named Hanako. He hasn't changed. His environment has. In college, did you imagine your life now? Ever think you'd be a ragpicker? I’d be lying if I said I didn't. Why'd he become one? I guess he had his reasons. He sings. Does he? Where'd we go then? We were all so young. What a funny island. Enoshima Island? I wonder why he stole the cup. You mentioned Ikona's work. I’m thinking about it. It may be our duty. My boss asked me today if we hadn't any children yet. You needn't come any more! He's from the ragpickers. Our office will take care of the trash. Get going! No, no, go around, not through here! We're putting up a fence! After this, you'll go around! Kuma! Kuma! No, you mustn't! I’m sorry. You all right? It's dirty there. Never mind. Let me. I’m sorry. Never mind. It's all right. I’m sorry. Are you all right? Yes, I am. Kuma's used to good things. Not much work around here now, is there? I have Kuma, so I can go anywhere. Never gets tired. Surprising. He can go 6, even 10 miles. When I was small, I walked miles and miles in Manchuria. Have to hurry when one gets old, or you begin to ache. Through shaving, Ikona-san? Hello. I was a bit upset last time. There's an opening at the Water Sanitation Association. Is it ready? Pretty soon. It smells good. Fire's dangerous. Go inside. We talk about you sometimes. Want the job? Doesn't seem hard. Hello, where's Kuma? I let him loose on Sundays. We were schoolmates. She wants to help too. Let's go to Mommy. Say, Ikona-kun! Please don't take this work away from me. Please. But... Please, I’m asking you. Hanako, go home and wait. ''YURI-GA-OKA STATION'' Eiichi-san... What? Let's take a walk. Isn't it muggy? You're perspiring so. What's that? What do you think it is? Guess. What is it? A waste of money? A revolving lantern? Let's take a few days' trip. The company has a dorm at Nasu. How beautiful! Just look! They say rabbits came out 4 or 5 years ago. Selling the shrine too? A nice hairdo. Makes you look mature. Can you get a leave? Get my airplane. Your plane? Ready? Here it goes. Here! Shall we go home? Was my hair better the old way? Good facilities at Nasu, they say. Two meals for only 400 yen. No good. The chief's going abroad next year. Not today. Wish we'd seen a movie last Sunday. Don't. They'll think you're mad. Like being inside a mountain. Perhaps no one's there. Where? Next door, or across the hall. What a funny thing to say. Good morning. Haven't seen you for a week. Please. Milk's in it. I went quite far away. Where did you go? All around Tokyo, I guess. No set customers. I was in Tachikawa three days. You living in your cart then? If you have a rag... Don't you like canals? You mean man-made rivers? Canals are nice. I haven't been downtown today. I’ll go to Sunamachi. I’ve never been there. Kuma, don't move when you're being wiped. There are a lot of bridges. All kinds of bridges. Every time we'd come to a bridge, Kuma would just stop there. Scared to cross? I need a new umbrella, but can't get one yet. My old one is weak, and it leaks on me. But it's not that bad. Another cup of coffee... I think an insect bit me. To the left. Shall I rub medicine on? It's nothing. A woman's exercising. Third floor, 2nd apartment from the right. Everyone does. It's night. What does that family do? Anything new today? Ikona-san doesn't come anymore, does he? Life for just the two of us? I don't mind apartments. The moisture's a bit unpleasant. About time to have a child? When I’m fifty, how old will it be? It's cool. Come out. Constellations interested me as a child. Autumn's in the air. Your 8mm camera? Too busy this time. The 30th. Evening? I hope it doesn't rain. Looks like it will. What's this? Spending money. Listen! Listen! She's not out here today? The girl whose eyes are bad? What happened? What is it? Hanako-chan... .. are you asleep Did I wake you up? I’m sorry. You're alone? What's the matter? A fever? Where's Mr. Ikona? He left the day before yesterday. Hasn't been back since the day before yesterday? What'll we do? Wait a minute. Anybody here? Hello! Big enough isn't it? Quite. ''HANAKO'S SICK. I’M TAKING HER. MRS. ISHIKAWA'' Hanako-chan, let's go to my place. What's the matter? You're sick. Let's go. We'll call a doctor to see you. Let me carry you. Hanako-chan, where's your bird? It flew away. Hold on to me tight. You were very brave. A light case of pneumonia. We'll know how she'll be in a few days. Excuse me. Is she staying here? Yes. lf there's a change, please come see her again. Please take care. Thank you, Doctor. It's cold. But it'll make you feel better. Did the shot hurt? No, it didn't. It didn't? You're very brave. Where have you been? Hanako-chan has pneumonia and almost died. I shouldn't have gone to Tachikawa. Be quiet. Kuma, be quiet, will you? Daddy! It's daddy. Daddy, your hand. It's cold. Are you glad I’m back? You are? Ikona-san, will you go and buy some ice? Then get her medicine at the Sato Hospital near the tracks. Now, Hanako-chan, the doctor said to rest quietly, didn't he? Eight pounds? Please hurry, won't you? Here, the money. Kuma, Kuma, Kuma, let's go. Hello. Hello. There's a bridge on the Tamagawa River. I wanted to stay a few days more. Kuma wouldn't move? Your door won't open. Knock three times? Three? I thought only once. Let's go, Kuma. Not returning to the office? I see. He's coming home directly? I see. Thank you very much. See, something nice from the lady. Auntie? See the two paper skirts? I made them. See the gold and white ones? Daddy made them. Very good. Here, Hanako-chan. I peeled a peach. Eat it. Is it good? Yes, it is. Last night I heard that insect. Sounds kind of soothing, doesn't it? Hanako-chan, what's the insect like? A secret? Am I right? Can I tell her? I don't think you'd hear it now. No one's ever seen the insect. I saw it. A long time ago. When you were a student? Still a little boy, weren't you? Long ago, anyway. It's awfully big. And pretty, like a beetle. Not like the ordinary ones. Will it come again? I’d like to hear it too. It won't come for two years, will it? Come on the 3rd year? It may die. Why? That's not so. He's teasing you. Let's sit down and talk. I waited a whole hour at the station. I don't understand. What are they to you? I... It's going too far for kindness! She loves insects. You're just drawn to them. No! You're wrong! What is it that you want? That child really needed me! You don't know what you really want. No, I don't. That's why I was trying to find out. I want to know. I’m an ordinary man. I want an ordinary life. I have my work. I wanted to find the confidence to bear you a child. That's something else, isn't it? Listen, there's so much I must tell you... it'll take days! I’ll call the charity hospital. Let's talk about them more. It's important to us, too! I don't think I’m wrong. Hanako-chan! Do as the doctor says. Blow your nose with paper. I’ll put the things you like here, see? Come and see me when you're well. ''GOLF PRACTICE RANGE ACCEPTING MEMBERS'' We're going on ahead. Leaving? Use this if you want to. It's goodbye. No use trying to stay. You'll have to leave, anyway. He's no good! He's stubborn. He won't leave. Let's catch his dog and tease it. Kuma! Kuma! Seen my dog? A dog. His name's Kuma! Seen Kuma? A dog - about so high. He's black. I heard a noise near the fence. A jet liner crashed again. What a shame - such a waste. A waste? Yes, one costs 100 million. Kuma. Kuma. Naoko! Kuma! Leave him alone! Please! Let's help him find the dog. It doesn't concern us! Understand? The dog's gone! It's important to him! I’m going! Ikona-san! She isn't here. The children's ward is full. No new patients. I see. But she should be here. My husband requested it. Hasn't she left already? I’ll ask. We look after so many. She was here until yesterday. An odd-looking man called. I don't remember. Is that all? Eiichi-san. Hear a dog? I don't know. It'll upset you if you brood over it. I went to the hospital. I hadn't been to one for a long time. You want tumblers? It seems a lot of ragpickers went to Tachikawa.
