One moment, I'll turn on the lights. Could you follow me? KIM Da-mi The gallery is downstairs. Watch yout step. JEON So-nee This way, please. BYUN Woo-seok Directed by MIN Yong-keun This is you, right? Take a closer look. It look like a photo but it's a drawing. It's hyperrealism. This entire drawing was done with a pencil. This piece won our gallery's recent contest, aside from the name 'Ha-eun,' there was no other information. The director would like to sign her as in-house artist, but we can't reach her. We sent an email but no response. I know that she's close friends with you. If you're in touch with her, could you introduce us? I don't really know her. We had run-ins as children. That wasn't the case at all. While searching online with her email, we came across a blog. Summer Milky Way There were posts about you two. It looked like you two were very close. This is a printout of the blog. Ahn Mi-so / Ko Ha-eun I'm sorry, I can't help you. Mi-so! It's been a while. Yeah, indeed. Are you in touch with Ha-eun? We lost touch a while ago. I thought you two would last. We were kids back then. By the way, what brings you here? Mr. Ham Jin-woo? - Hello. - Evening. One sec. Thank you for coming. I'm curator Kang Mal-geum. Hi. Shall we talk inside? Mi-so! Spring, 2001, Graduation Summer Milky Way Summer, 1998 I remember the cicadas when I think about those days. They sounded sluggish somehow. It was a hot day, and the class was boring. One that sluggish day, you came along. 'Who' is gathering 'what' from 'where'? Now, we can replace 'who' with 'aunt', and 'what' with... - Location. - That's right. One moment. Hello. I brought you the new student. I see. Come in. We got a new student from Seoul. Could you introduce yourself? Ahn Mi-so. Ahn Mi-so. And? Do you want to say anything to the class? All right, do you see that desk? Go sit over there. Okay, let's continue. 'Where' is where? What is this referring to? So this has to be a location. And when referring to gathering... Ahn Mi-so! Ahn Mi-so! Get back here! Ahn Mi-so! Stop right there! Hey! Ahn Mi-so! Your bag! Take it, you left it. come up, stairs are over there! Why not? I can't go anywhere high, I'm scared. When you're scared, just squint. It's less scary. What's your name? Ko Ha-eun. Ha-eun? Does it mean 'summer' and 'Milky Way'? Summer Milky Way? Not for Milky Way, it means 'gentle'. 'Gentle summer' is boring. Go with 'Summer Milky Way.' The 'Mi-so' literally means smile? Probably. Then why don't you ever smile? I don't? No, not at school, not right now. Because Ahn means 'not'? She's drenched. It's okay. What do we do? It's okay, kitty. Could you wipe her? What's that? She was alone in the rain, so I brought her. And her? My friend. Wash up quickly, let's eat. Isn't it stuffy wearing these? It is. - Why do you wear it? - I dunno. Girls are supposed to suck it up, so it becomes comfy later. I won't wear it when I grow up, I hate feeling stuffy. Ha-eun, not again? Carrots are sucky. I told you eat what you're given. Your mom and I raised the crop ourselves. I still hate it! Put them back in. You're embarrassing yourself in front of your friend! Let her be, don't force it on her! She'll eat it herself when she grows up. She became a picky eater because you baby her. Eat what you're given. That's enough, you're stubborn like others in your family. Not at the table... I can't eat these... But I like carrots. Cool! I'll eat broccoli. Problem solved. Carrots for Mi-so, broccoli for Ha-eun. Happy? Jeez! Here. One sec. Here. Good evening, I'm so sorry. Hello... Come here. Can't you call me and tell me where you are? And why did you run off like that, you embarrassed me. I said I don't want to go to school. I'll transfer again soon anyway. I told you, not this time! You said the same thing in Bucheon. And Gangneung too. How many times already this year? Ahn Mi-so! When his situation improves, he'll bring us back to Seoul! You're not the only one, I'm sick of this too! You only care about yourself... It looks the same, will you be an artist? No. Why? You draw so well. Dad said artist starve to death. Try it too. I don't draw so well... Doesn't matter, anyone can draw. What should we call her? I have a name in mind. What? 'Mom'. 'Mom'? You can't call a cat that. But you can call it affectionately. Mom! Mom! Mom! This is her? Which way is up? These are eyes, legs here. And her feelings. Feelings? You drew that too? Yeah! Is it weird? No. That's when I first realized, feelings can be drawn too. You'd moved me with weird words at times. Same thing happened when your mom moved back. I didn't say anything and just felt sad, but you said we'd never be apart. You'd rather stay in Jeju alone. We were able to stay together because of what you said. Mi-so. You think you're Picasso? Stick with the basics, okay? Okay. Skip class and come out to the front gate. Then this poetry is about waiting for peonies, and sadness that came after spring, but he still waits. It's a misconception that peonies symbolize 'independence'. What's wrong? You got a fever? I had a sore throat since the morning... I think the fever's getting worse. All right, head home and get some rest. Ko Ha-eun! Ha-eun, you're evolving. It felt so stuffy, I almost died. I had club activity, so I left, no one looks for me. What's going on today? Your birthday's tomorrow, let's get your ears pierced. Why do that for my birthday? Or you'll never get pierced. What? You need someone to push you into doing it. It's good for blood circulation too, it's good for you, me, someone's sister, and others too. Bullshitting again. One, two, three, four! One, two, three! You did good. It really doesn't hurt? It stings for a second. Pain is temporary, and pleasure is permanent. It's not the other way? No, it changed recently. One, two... Hold on! You have to do it after three, okay? Don't do it on three. I'll count to three, and then do it, so stay still, or you'll get hurt. One, two, three! What was that? Why did that fall? Oh man, come on... Did you knock them over with your bag? No, I wasn't doing anything, they just fell by themselves. How could they fall on their own? What a load of crap. Those cost over $100, what did you do? How could they cost that much? They look a few bucks each. We'll compensate you. If thet're so expensive, why put them by the door? Stop it. Sir, we'll pay you for them. I've never seen such a brat! You broke them, yet you show no remorse. Which school do you go to? You look like a trade school student. Are you badmouthing trade schools? You got an anger issue, you dumb trade schooler! Sir, don't do that! We got a set of lunatics! Ha-eun, let's just go, he's not worth the fight. Where are you going? Get back here! Pay for the damages! Get back here! You brats! You bitches! Just wait till I catch you! Stop right there! Stop, you brats! I'm gonna kill you two! I'll see you in a bit! What? You said you'll pay! Stop right there! Just pay the cost price! Mi-so. Try this drink. Carrot drinks are good for girls. Wow, thank you. You got no manners, you brought just one? You hate carrots! You could've brought mom's sweet rive drink. Now you're ordering me around? If you want it, you can go grab it. Sometimes I wonder which one's your daughter. - Mi-so. - Yes? Isn't is tough working at the hostel? It's fine, I got a roof over my head too. Does your mom call often? No. No news is good news. When things get tough, don't hesitate so talk to me. You're pretty and talented, so it's all up to you. Got it? Yup. Boss, I'm here! Hey there. Mind if my friend sleeps over? - Good evening? - Hey. It's childish, right? Nope. The art teacher complimented you, she said you got talent. That's weird, she always belittles me. You can't drink after getting a piercing. Why not? You already drank so much. I'm still sober, so sober! It's red already. Whose song is this? Janis Joplin. - Oldie? - Yeah. She's the real deal, her songs are too. Why? She died at the age of 27. What's that got to do with her being the real deal? She died in her prime. She sang with everything she's got with this voice. I want to live like crazy for 10 years, and die at 27. What about me then? You gotta live till 100, live my share too. I'm kidding, you look so drunk. If you die before me, I'll kill vou. Fine, fine. I'll live till I'm old and wrinkly, and I'll paint the wall with shit. Forget it, who's gonna clean that up? Who else, you! You! - Stop it, I'll get wrinkles! - Who cares! Stop it, stop! Wait a minute, something's on you, it's you! Ha-eun. Let's get breakfast. - Breakfast? - Yeah. Where are we? A resort that went bust, I guess no one bought it. So I took it over. Please come in! Tada! Tada again! It's got your initials, this is H and E. That's why you told me to get pierced yesterday? Yes. But you only got one ear done, so wear the other one later. Put it on for me. It'll hurt right now because of swelling. It's okay, I can suck it up. All done. You wear this until I get the other ear pierced. Come here, I'll put it on for you. I'll ride the Trans-Siberian train to Lake Baikal first. Then off to France to learn to paint and attend galleries. And from Spain, you can hop on a ferry to Morocco. So I'll do a full circle around North Africa. Come with me. You know I can't fly, I'm afraid of heights.. We can get to Vladivostok on a ferry, so it's okay. Travel, learn to paint. You said you wanted to live your life painting. Painting feels so foreign to me. My dad's dream is for me to become a teacher. Let your dad achieve his own damn dream. Come with me, please? It's scary somehow. What's there to be scare of? I'll protect you. Who's protecting whom? You look so frail. Lean on me. You're not my boyfriend, why should I lean on you? Whatever, it's not like you got a boyfriend. Eh? You do? I met a guy from Hanra High basketball club early in the semester. You're not dating already ? No, we only saw that one time. There's a club soiree this weekend, so who knows. You like him? I wanna draw. Draw what? His face. You always draw your teacher on the textbook all the time. That's different, his eyes are so pretty. Why are you so serious? - We'll head out first. - Yeah. 'Panic'? It's a 'Panic' song. You like oldies? Got a girlfriend? Dated a lot of girls? Do you know me? You got a club soiree this weekend, right? There's a girl who's interested in you, so act properly. If you're not into her, say so, but if you do, stick with her. Don't be vague, and no heartbreaking. Are you the one interested in me? Piss off. Don't get ahead of yourself. Then who are you? Me? Janis Joplin. Hey, scooter! Get out of there! If you see me again, just ignore me. Get off the field! All right. All right, what's our soiree's highlight? Don't play dumb. It's mating! Are we animals? Stop saying 'mating'! Coupling! As per our club's tradition, it's done with a game of Go-Stop.. If there's someone you like, shout Go at him. Then the one selected now has a choice, either Go or Stop. If you don't like him? Then Go someone else, or Stop if you like him. And we got a new couple. - Okay? - Okay! Go. Whoa. Go. Go. Holy cow! Go. Really? Stop. That's awesome... Ha-eun The person you're calling is unavailable. Why do you want to draw me? I get to know it as I draw. Know what? Feelings. Feelings? When I draw exactly the same, I get to see my feelings. I begin to understand how I feel about this person. So I have to draw as close to the real thing as possible. Without exaggeration. - Can I take a picture? - Yeah. I like you. To like someone, you gotta be courageous. I'm working up the courage to say this. Summer, 2004 It didn’t take long to become close to Jin-woo. I wanted to bring my 2 favorite people together... Eh? Sunglasses? Can you see? I told you about him, this is Ham Jin-woo. Good evening. This is my BFF. Ahn Mi-so. You two are the same age, so become friends. I’m gonna hit the restroom, have a chat. You’re her, right? Janis Joplin. Right? You are, could I get a 7UP? No soda to minors, only alcohol, $10. What is it? Sex... 0n the Chilly. Why does she like you? Everything. Why do you like her? Everything. That’s a dumb answer for when you don’t know that person well. Then why do you like her? Her eyes when she suddenly turns around, tears after a yawn, and her 2 front teeth when she smiles. And a mole on her right cheek. She doesn’t have a mole on her cheek. She dees. - She doesn’t. - She does. She doesn’t. For the next song, we’ll bring out our muse. Ahn Mi-so, come! Come on, Mi-so! Ahn Mi-so! Ahn Mi-so! Isn’t she cool? She’s one of a kind. Sometimes I’m jealous of her. How so? She’s so free. and also very delicate. Three. That's good. Let's take a photo. 3 seconds! One, two, three, jump, jump! One more time, jump higher! One, two, three! One, two, three! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Nice! Three! Come on! Jin-woo, you okay? All good. Jin-woo, have fun! What is it? I think I'm getting a blister. Are you okay? Can you continue? Does it hurt? You two go on ahead. I'll stay here. We gotta make a wish together, this was your idea! You can make a wish for me. Okay. You stay with her. I'll make wishes for all of us. Mi-so! Huh? Without permission? You looked so happy. Of course, I'll be back! Jin-woo, go with her, she might get hurt. You sure? Get going. Ahn Mi-so! Is that your guardian? Yeah, but it's not effective. And yours? Why do you always have that? This? It's called 'byukjomok', it's made from a lightning-struck jujube tree. - Lightning? - Yeah. It supposedly wards off misfortune. I almost died of an illness. as a kid, but I recovered after wearing this. Can I look at it? It wasn't so bad walking slowly. Did you make my wish? Yeah, let's go. It might be dangerous. You two take the bike, I'll go slow on this. No, it's mine, l'll ride it. Have a safe ride, I'm gonna go ahead. It felt weird seeing your back as you took off. I realized that I don't remember seeing your back. Because you were always beside me. Let me go say good bye. Okay. I'm off. You like him enough to drop out and leave? How could you just leave? Without telling me anything. I want to go to Seoul now. And he says he needs me. You? Do you need him too? He's good to me. He'll introduce me to his art teacher friend. What's the only reason? Mi-so! Get back in! Okay! I gotta go. Will you be back? Of course! Don't talk like you'll never see me again. Call me often, okay? Yeah, don't cry because I won't be here. Could you hurry up?! We're departing soon, hurry, hurry! We have to go, I'm gonna drive. Do you remember? You told me a passage from a book you read. You said the sun can shine brightly because of the shadow. Even though they can't become one. the shadow is always there in the distance. so the sun was never lonely, and is able to shine. I suddenly remember that. Letter, 2006 Dear Ha-eun. Sorry I haven't been in touch. I lost my phone like an idiot. It's a bit tough qetting up here. but you can't beat the price with a house this spacious. I finally got a rental today. It's on a hill, so It's tough getting up here, but it's got a killer view. I'm gonna paint for real here. I work at the club where Ki-hoon performs, and take classes in the day, It's a bit tiring, but that's okay. This is just the beginning. It's nice to have an address to send letters to. I took the college entrance exam, but I don't know what to major. Both dad and Jin-woo want me to be a teacher. If that happened, there won't be a problem, but it would also be dull. Mi-so. Isn't it weird that one exam seals our future? Yeah, everyone boils their life for that one day. It's the same for my art class. Everyone draws the same thing. But I got a compliment for the first time in my life. The instructor here said my painting is unique and got character. He wants me to be his protégé. So Ha-eun, live the life that you feel like living. Trust your talent. I thought things would be very different in college. But I'm still the same. Classes are boring, and I just doodle. But when l doodle, I feel at ease. How was your Christmas? I'm so glad I came to Seoul. I met so many different people here. Everyone likes me and I get a lot of inspiration. Seeing so many people live free, I learn so much from them. Ha-eun. I'm gonna travel a lot and paint for real. Mi-so's Homepage It makes me feel good to imagine you traveling and drawing. It feels like I'm receiving some courage somehow. This is embarrassing... but should I take up drawing again like you? Guess where I am. I'm finally starting the journey on the Trans-Siberia train. It'll take 50 days to reach Moscow from Vladivostok. I want to stop at Olkhon Island to check out Lake Baikal. Remember what I told you? Go to Europe afterwards, and head to Morocco. I want to capture these new worlds with my drawings. It might be a long journey. I'll send you a postcard from Lake Baikal. Bye. Thank you! So? If the transfer is finalized, then it's a done deal. Sorry I didn't tell you earlier. I'll come back after the regular classes. Can't you do it here? Do you have to go to Seoul? I told you. My medical school will be turned into a college. If I'm going to transfer, Seoul is the best option. Ha-eun. I want to do this the right way. Mi-so, how's your travel? I sometimes imagine. what the world you see is like, and what kind of drawing you're creating. I wanted to visit you in Seoul when I got into college, but I never got to. It's been 5 years. I didn't know our time apart would be this long back then. You've received a message Looks like I'm always sending people away. Saying farewell is alwavs difficult. When lbecome an adult, would it get easier? Did you arrive in Lake Baikal well? I'm still waiting for that postcard. I'm curious what you look like in front of that lake. I'll visit often. Take care of yourself. Don't cry. After arriving in Moscow via Trans-Siberia train. I looped around Europe on a train. then went back to Morocco. You sure got grits for a girl. You're something. I knew I'd regret it if I was too scared to travel. This was made by the Spanish fypsies. Oh my! - Isn't it pretty? - Yeah! Mi-sol! You're better than my own daughter! It's so pretty! You try it too. Let's see, you're a hottie! You look so young! Where's mine? Yours? Right here! Here. Really? Postcards? Where is this? Lake Baikal. Where's Lake Baikal? Is that in Russia? In Siberia? Change into this. Wanna bathe together? We're not kids anymore. You don't have to, but show me your titties. What? You pervert! Hey! Mi-so! Look it the sky! It's so pretty, let's have fun in Busan later! - Look, sun! - Where? Wow, it's Busan! It's so big! Look how shiny it looks. One, two, three! One, two, three! - Lookup. - Jesus! I can't do this! Anyone here? Hello? Yes? Is there a room? Temporary or overnight? Sleep here? Yeah! How much is overnight? 40$. Let's go elsewhere. Why? It's cheap here. Sorry about that. It's so soft. Aren't you happy we came here? Since you paid for the room, I'm buying dinner. Sure! Ha-eun, could you grab a pad from my bag? Okay! Are you hungry? What should we have? Pork belly? 0r there's a famous pork feet in Nampo, how about that? Let's have something amazing. Mom gave me some money to use in emergency. Why? Don't feel like pork feet? Found it? Yeah. - Welcome. - Table for 2. - Do you have a reservation? - No. I'll show you to your table. Thank you. Let's go somewhere else, prices here are outrageous. Let's just eat, I'll chip in. We can eat till our belly burst for half the price elsewhere. We gotta spurge a little. When will I dine at a place like this with you? Hold on a sec. Could I borrow a shaker? Thank you. Could I make you cocktails in exchange for a bottle of wine? Gents, would it be okay if she makes you cocktails? Of course, bravo! Nice! Pour it, pour it! Chug it. chug it! She's a whale! You're amazing! This is a $120 bottle! Thank you! Let's have some fun, this is a $120 bottle. What was that? What was what? You don't know those men. They came here to spurge. I got them hyped up and got this in exchange. Why freeload drinks from strangers? I didn't freeload. I was fairly compensated for a job I performed. Did you come here to work? We came here for fun. You didn't know? This is how I live. Mi-so... Didn't I tell you? l was so starving one time but I had no money. So i did the 'Free Hug' for $1 each, but since it wasn't free, I called it 'Healing Hug'. Do you know how much I made in 3 hours? Okay, stop it. I made $50. So I ate steak with it. Was I freeloading then too? Don't go around saying that. Why? Do I embarrass you? You'll never ever understand, how I lived thus far. Hi. Is your friend a whale too? How much can you drink? Go away. Eh? She's so respectful. You're cute when you play hard to get. I got a boyfriend, please go away. I got a wife. Just go, we're having a private conversation. What got up your butt all of sudden? You were kissing our asses back there. Piss off, asshole, before I break this bottle and scar your face. Come on, let's go. She's scary. What the hell's your problem! She's a psycho! What do you want to eat? I'm gonna order a steak. Screw that, get a pizza, I'm buying. Excuse me. Yes? Could we get 2 tenderloin steaks? Absolutely, right away. Where am I supposed to freeload steaks now? What's with you? Since you paid for the room, I wanted to get dinner. You know what my life's like, so how could we have hotel steak? I'm buying because I got money right now. Why are you being so calculative between friends? Calculative? You were never like that? Jin-woo Answer, I'll step out for a bit. Why should you? It's Jin-woo, chat with him freely. Why should you step out for him? He's got nothing to do with you. Or are you feeling guilty? Look at you. See how you're being calculative? You pretend to be naive on the outside, but calculating everything on the inside. Aren't you the one who feels guilty? What do you mean? When I said I was leaving for Seoul with Ki-hoon, you were bawling, but happy on the inside. No? Autumn, 2012 You're worried about land acquisition rate the most. As of yesterday, it's at 93,7%. You could say it's all but confirmed. Wouldn't it be safer to wait for regular pre-sale? You can only take advantage of pre-sale bonus when you sign up before 95%. You know my agency already invested in 2 lots. My office is upstairs. What do you do? I consult pre-sale lots, but that's a side hustle. Main is investment. Hanwool A&D You can answer. It's the office, I'll be up in a bit. What have you been up to? Ha-eun is assigned to a school near her Jeju home, I'm studying for medical licensing exam to become a doctor. Does she come to Seoul often? I go to her, you know she can't fly. That's jus an excuse, she wants you to come to Jeju. You still don't know her well. You two? No contact? - Good bye! - Bye! Come on! Ahn Mi-so Hanwool A&D Gotta go, the boss must be looking for me. If it's important, please do. Half work, half pleasure, the boss is my boyfriend. When his new business is approved, and after all the pre-sales, we'll go live in Canada. When will you two get married? Janis Joplin I'll be in Canada next year, so I won't be able to attend. congratulate her for me. I gotta go. We've arrived, paramedics are heading up! Which office? 506. Hanwool A&D. Hurry! Paramedics on the way! - Hurry - Where are you? I have to go in! You can't go in there! Please stop! Why can't I go?! - Please calm down. - Stop! Let go of me! Calm down please. Mi-so. Let go! Get it together! Jin-woo The person you are calling is unavailable... Where are you? Call me when you can. Ha-eun. I missed you... Open the door. You stay out. Ha-eun... My lover died recently. He wasted all my money and killed himself. So i was kicked out of my room before I could move out. That's why I came here... So tired... Do it if you want to... You wanted to for a long time. What? Jin-woo isn't watching, so do whatever you want. How could you say that? Please... Just spill it! Don't keep everything inside you. Or just leave me alone! I'm so sick and tired because of you. Sick and tired? I'm the one who's sick and tired! Had you thought of me even a little. No, if you thought of us, you wouldn't be wearing this! You don't know why I'm wearing this... Yeah, I don't know anything. You're always the victim, and the one who has it had. You don't care why people around you have it bad. You said you'd never wear stuff like this. And yet you wear it? Jin-woo doesn't like this style. He likes these, take a look. No, please! Look at it carefully! He likes tacky bras! I'm sorry, Ha-eun... Stop it... Did you sleep with him? No... Ha-eun, no... Do you think people around you all loved you? Your lover, your mom, Jin-woo... do you think any of them truly loved you?! You got no one except me! No one in this world ever loved you except me! You're right. Without you, I'm nothing... How did we end up like this? Ha-eun... Thank you for everything, Jin-woo. Lend me this. What? You said this kept you alive, I think I need this. I don't want to die until I'm 27. I'm unavailable at the moment. Mi-so. A month went by. I didn't want to think about anything, but you can't force your mind to take a break. I moved out of my Seoul apartment. I want to prep for the exam here. I'll spend the rest of my life making up to you for all my mistakes... We decided to get married after his exam. and started living in a Jeju house provided by his parents. It was a bit scary. It was my first time leaving home. - Ha-eun. - Yeah? Should we head to Seoul when we have a child? Why? There's difference in salary. and I want to be where the opportunity is. I'm not sure, I never thought about living in Seoul. This was my dream, just like you becoming a teacher. I never wanted to he a teacher. Huh? I never once wanted to be a teacher. What do you mean? Then why go to teachers college? Should I give up teaching and learn to paint? Paint? I always liked painting ever since I was a kid. I know you draw so well. Actually, when we first met. I was so shocked by that drawing, it was incredible. - Really? - Yeah. But Ha-eun, could you leave it as a hobby? Drawing realistically is a skill, not a talent. Yes, slightly to this way, oh, very good! Please smile widely! Very nice, hold it, one, two! Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. Family. please! It was selfish, and I felt bad for everyone. but it was my best. After the big wave washed over, my mind became clearer. I decided to leave Jeju. - Were you disappointed? - Sure I was. If I wasn't, I'd be an angel. I'm sorry I didn't get to live the life you wanted. What's the life I wanted for you? You know, a normal life. Do you know why every face is different? So that they can all live different lives. Turns out, there is no set way of life. Live the way you want to. That's what I really want. I was always curious about your home in Seoul. It didn't feel unfamiliar. Maybe that's why I felt at home. It was quiet enough to feel the time flow. And of course, lonely too. I thought of the faces I missed. Mom's face, dad's face, Jin-woo's face... But the face I missed the most was yours, Mi-so. - Who is it? - It's Mi-so. - Welcome. - Hey there. I'm back. Good afternoon. She's the friend I told you about, Ko Ha-eun. - Welcome. - Hello. This is my landlord, and Sung-yeon. Hi. I'm a tenant, just like Mi-so. You didn't have dinner yet? Go have a chat, I'll get it ready. Crème de la crème of our 28-course meal! Let's take a look. It's incredible. You don't eat like this everyday, right? Of course not, how would we do that? 28 courses today, 72 yesterday and 146 2 days ago. Yeah, last week was tough with 385 courses. We had food to the door and ate for 4 days. Stop it, it's not funny. How did the three of you came to live together? My husband passed away and I looked for roommates, and to make some money. And Sung-yeon was working at a restaurant.
