Looks like somebody lost their new shiny limo. -[LAUGHS] Finders keepers! -Hey, what do you mean? I saw it first. It's mine! -You guys going to sit there like the wild one's, or are you going to give a girl a hand? -Woo-ee! Wow! Ha-ha! -Oh, I'm stranded in the desert, and, uh, Marlon over there is laughing. Cute. -[LAUGHING] Marlon! Woo-wee! Woo! [LAUGHING] Hey, madame, madame, madame, madame, yes, ma'am! BIKER 1: Well, little lady, what seems to be the problem? -Yeah, little lady. What seems to be the problem? --[LAUGHING] Well, the problem seems to be it just won't go. -What, it just stop on you? -Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's what it did. It just, um-- we were just driving along, and then, uh, nothing. -What do you mean we? Who's we? -My driver and I. He started walking back to that little town that we just past. It has been quite a while. He should be back with help any time now. -Well, you never can tell. That's a long walk. -Woo! Hey, man, woo! Woo-ee! This would make one hell of a dune buggy, wouldn't it? CROW: Hey! They got a regular guy tavern back here. BIKER 3: Yeah? -May I pour you a drink, sir? -Hey, it's a little early. But I don't mind if I do. Boy, give me some of that. Come one, pour boy. [LAUGHING] Hey, this is great, isn't it? Hey what's this, here, huh? Hey, look at that! It's TV! Hey, it works, too! Hey! TV: Meep-meep! -Hey, look at that! The--the roadrunner! Boy, [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] Hey man [INAUDIBLE] -I don't enjoy watching TV without company. -Yeah, hey! Hey baby! Hey, come here. You're missing all the action, little lady. Come here, will you? Come on! You see that? You try to be nice and friendly. You see what happens? You see that? We're getting snubbed, Crow. CROW: Get her! -I said come back here, little lady! I said come back here! When I tell you to come back here, you come back here. You understand me? Come back here, now. Come on! -Hey! Wait a minute! I think you've seen too many motorcycle movies. CROW: You're not very friendly, are you? I know what's the matter. I know. You don't like my Yul Brynner look. [SHOUTING] Come on, baby. [SHOUTING] -What the hell do you think you're doing? -Man, you don't hit something that looks that good. [YELLS] -I'm going to hand you your head, man! -Moon ain't going to like hearing about this. -You know that for a fact? -Yeah, I know that for a fact! -So don't tell him. He's got enough problems. -Hey. I guess I should thank you. -Thank me? How do you know I wasn't saving you for myself? -Well in that case, uh, you better hurry. Because the auto club will be here any minute now. [CAR HORN] -Win a few, lose a few, right? -Right. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The Moon and his satellites request your presence at the throne. -Three stooges don't look too happy, do they? You wanted to see me? -Yeah, man, I would like to hear your version of what happened on the highway. -Would you like me to kneel and kiss your ring before I start? -Rider, that mouth of yours is going to get you in a whole lot of trouble. -Look, man, we had a beef over a chick, and I got her. That's all. So what's the problem? -You seem to be, man. I mean, like, we got the club, here, see, huh? And here you are way over there. And they just never seem to blend! -Fine, fine. Talk with the boys. If you want me to cut out, I'm gone. [WHISTLE] [LAUGHING] -Hey, what's going on, man? -Let's hear it for Pom Pom! Her first bath of the year! [CHEERING] [LAUGHING] -All right, you broads clean up a little bit, because it's a work day. I mean, 'cause the bank account's a little low. And it's time for you to hit the streets again. [LAUGHING] -I wonder if that includes our dear little Pom Pom. -Are you kidding? That's Moon's private stock. -The fact is, ladies, little Pom Pom's Moon's queen. And queens don't hustle now do they? -Crow! You go get Pom Pom! I mean everybody works! -Ach! -Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Howdy. -Howdy! -What's a nice girl like you doing out hitchhiking? -Well, uh, I tell you. I need $15. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well hi! -Hi! Where you going? -Down the road a piece. -Don't see many pretty girls like you hitching rides around here. -Is that a fact? -Yep. You a student? -No. [MUSIC PLAYING] --[INAUDIBLE] It's my favorite thing to eat! Look at that chicken. Look at the vein licking over the [INAUDIBLE] Black meat on white meat. That's a [INAUDIBLE] Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You understand? Chicken, Beef Stroganoff, [INAUDIBLE] with a lot of mayonnaise on top, tomatoes, [INAUDIBLE] But this is my favorite. Doesn't give you calories. Keeps you nice and trim. Nice and trim. How old are you? -Well, I'm in my early sixties. -Hm. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [THUD] -Here. -Thanks. -Do you know where all the parts go? -More or less. -Ah, look at Rabbit. -What's the matter? -He can go on like that all night. -Well that's why they call him Rabbit. Yeah, old Rabbit does all right. -I hear you do, too. -Oh, I try to hang in there. -Oh, you've, um, been with the group about a month, now. And you've had your shot at all of the other girls. I figure I'm 29 days overdue. -Well you just keep marking your calendar, baby. [LAUGHS] -New tattoo? -What's it going to say? -Property of the Heads. -It should say this property condemned. [LAUGHING] -I know why you avoid me. Because you're scared sill of Moon! -[LAUGHS] -No, all the guys are! That's why they stay the hell away from me. Won't you leave this stuff alone and pay attention to me? Damn you! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Let's take a look! BIKER 1: Hey, what's Moto-X? -$2, thank you. Hey! Hey, that'll be $20! -What? [INAUDIBLE] -Well, aren't you glad you came out to see what the other half does on a Sunday afternoon? -I never thought it would be this exciting, but-- -[LAUGHS] Don't be smart. -Uh, Larry and the models are arriving tonight. I'd like to bring them here in the morning. You know, just to get a feel of the place. -All right. -Maybe we can get a few preliminary shots for the layout, with just you and the girls. -You got it. -Oh, and please bring your racing leathers. -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you. -You're welcome. [MOTORCYCLE NOISES] [CHEERING] [INAUDIBLE] -Those characters over there. That's what gives motorcycling a bad name. -Hey, let's show these mini-motors what a real bike will do! -Wait a minute! What is it with you guys? [MUSIC PLAYING] -They ought to have their heads examined taking Choppers on a Motocross course. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] -Yes, sir! What can I do for you today? -I'm interested in a dirt bike. -Well, you've come to the right place, son. I'm going to make you a deal you won't believe. It's our current inventory, and we are giving our motorcycles away. Did you see one you liked in particular? -Yes, sir. The one on the end. -The F5? I can see you know your motorcycles. That happens to be the best buy on the lot. What do you ride? -A Honda. I just sold it. -Yes, sir. You won't find a better buy for your money-- no. Only $695 for a bike that's like brand new. Between you and me-- our cost-- we won't make a penny. -Can I try it out? -Oh, I'm sorry, it's not licensed for the street. No muffler, no lights. Strictly a dirt bike. -Well, I never buy anything without trying it first. -I tell you what. I'll load it on the truck. We'll go out to the desert, and you can give it a spin. -How about if I just take it around the building once, just see how it runs? -Well, no harm in that. Don't gun it, though. We don't want to upset the neighbors. Would, uh, you like me to take care of that for you? -Thanks. -Hey, come back here! [MUSIC PLAYING] -What the hell is he doing out there? -Who knows. There were a bunch of them out here at the race yesterday. They made asses of themselves trying to burn up the course on Choppers. ANN: Bonnie, a little closer. Eddie, we need you. -Uh, in a second. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] ANN: OK, next change. OK, around the bike. Whatever you want to do. Ok, Eddie. Eddie, why don't you put your helmet on? Yeah, good. Uh, Bonnie could you move over next to Paula? Yeah, good. Keep Eddie and the motorcycle [INAUDIBLE] Small world. You're up early. You out, uh, rescuing ladies in distress? -Well that's my thing. I guess it's the boyscout in me. -Mm, isn't it ironic how our paths keep crossing. -I have a strange feeling, man, that you keep following me. -I was here first. PHOTOGRAPHER: Ann? -Excuse me. -How do you like it? -I like it. -I'm the southwest distributor for these. That's our new model over there. -The bike or the girl? ANN: OK Paula, next change. Uh, on this one we'll just use Bonnie and Eddie. -Didn't your mother ever tell you you're known by the company you keep? -Who's the guy in the leathers? -Eddie Ellis. He's one of my racers. -Does she work for you, too? -No, our company made a deal with her fashion house. Her clothes, our motorcycles. It's good publicity. You race? -No. -You ought to. You ride as well as anyone around here. -Charlie? -Enter next Sunday's Motocross. All it'll cost you is a $15 entry fee. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [SHOUTING] -Wait for me! -Hey, where did you get the new toy? -Oh, I came across a deal I couldn't pass up. -What are you going to do with it? -I'm going to race at the [INAUDIBLE] this Sunday. -Great! Hey, Moon, he's going to race this thing! I mean it-- let me ride it. Come on. -All right. -All right, come on. Help me with it. [INAUDIBLE] Check this thing out! [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Number 10, next! Next. Thank you. Number 11. Next! Thank you. Number 12. I hope it's a lucky number for you. -Thank you, ma'am. -Bet you've got talent! -Take a good look at his behind, because that's all you're going to see. -Get on that [INAUDIBLE] baby! [INAUDIBLE] -Put it there! Hey, put this on your head! They don't know how hard it is. -Yeah, baby! Put that hat on! Get that baby on! OK, here go! [WHISTLING AND SHOUTING] -Pig! -The name's Selma! [LAUGHING] -Well you get out and get us some chow, Selma. -[WHISTLES] Come on, Zit-zit! -I see you took my advice. Well, you got the right machine. Good luck. -Thanks! Hey. -You talking to me? -Where's your friend today? -I have lots of friends. -Ah, the good looking redhead. -I have no idea. [CHEERING] -OK, they're coming. Eddie's in second. Now let's see if you can get a shot of him in the air right behind the girls. -Hey, isn't that your buddy in the zebra helmet? [CHEERING] -It's the last lap! The last lap! [INAUDIBLE] He's right in there! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Go! Go! -Oh! [SHOUTING] -Do you see it! [INAUDIBLE] third place! [INAUDIBLE] -Hey! -Hey, where you going? -If you guys want to watch this freak show, man, that is your hang up, not mine. -Congratulations! What a race! -You got a machine I can borrow for the next race? -Come on up to the truck. I'll give you Eddie's spare. [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Boy, you should've sett it! C.C. walked off with the whole spread! Yeah, he got two second place, and one third place! 44 on the point system! -That guy got first place in the other race, but C.C. got the most points over all! 600 big ones, man! The kitty's back! -Back? Hell, it's pregnant! [LAUGHING] -Moon, you should've seen it. The dudes ate it up. They really loved him. -Yeah, show him, C.C. Show him the bread, baby! [LAUGHING AND CHEERING] BIKER: Oh, Moonie! [INAUDIBLE] [SHOUTING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Where's the rest? [SHOUTING] -Chow and booze, baby! [INTERPOSING VOICES] -You bought $175 worth of chow, man? Come on! -I'm keeping $100 for my personal account. -[LAUGHS] Rider-- Rider I thought I explained this whole set-up. You see, in this merry band, all the money-- I mean all the money, baby-- goes into the pot. See, it's like that-- share, share life. Let's have it. -$500. That's a nice contribution. I'll keep this. -Let me tell you something. See, I'm giving the orders. You just follow them. [MUSIC - "SEE SEE RIDER"] [WHISTLING] -Here you go boy! [INAUDIBLE] -How do you feel? -Like being alone. -Hey look, uh, Moon's a lot worse off than you are. You really cut him up. -So what the hell are you doing here? -Man, you are really conceited! I came all the way out here just to find out how you felt, and you start with that lip. -I think it's the Boy Scout in me. -You-- Ow! [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] -Hey! What do you want me to do with this? -Park it. -Excuse me. Um, do you know where I can find Charlie Hopkins? -Oh, well aren't you even going to say hello? -I always thought the blondes had more fun. -Mm, check with me tomorrow. It's my first day as a brunette. What happened to your face? -It's nothing. I thought your bag was taking pictures. -And the stories that go with them. Here, see anybody you know? -What's this for? -Harper's Bazaar. Oh, and I'm glad you came by. Here. Sign here, please. -Mm-hmm. Well, what is it? -A standard release form giving me the right to reproduce your likeness. -You get the release. What do I get? -Oh, your name in a magazine, uh, fan-mail from oversexed housewives, a year's subscription Popular Mechanics. Anything but money. -Is Charlie around? -Oh, and I thought you came by to see me. -I came by to see about getting a job. -Doing what? -Racing Charlie's bike. -Well he's got a rider. Eddie Ellis. -So he gets two riders for the price of one. -Well the last time I saw Charlie, he was downstairs at the bar. Hey, I need a release. -And I need a place to stay. You think we can work something out? [MUSIC - "CAN'T TURN YOU LOOSE"] -Wouldn't your friends be jealous if they saw how you were living? -Not how I'm living so much as with whom I'm living. -Ah, it's beautiful, isn't it? It's hard to believe that by this time tomorrow I'll be back in that seventh avenue rat race. -Then don't go. -I have to -Why? -You know, that's a very good question. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Can I ask you a personal question? -I wish you would. -How did a nice boy like you get involved with a group like the Heads? -I turned to them after I was rejected by the Daughters of the American Revolution. -Oh, wise decision. No, come on, tell me. -Once upon a time, I was working in a bike shop. And they came in for some repairs. -For themselves or their bikes? -Don't interrupt. -Oh. -I did all this work for them, and they didn't want to pay me. So we got into a scuffle. -And? -I don't know, I guess they liked the way I handled myself. And then they asked me ride with them. -You just took off? -My boss and I weren't exactly on the best of terms. And a couple of girls were getting to be a hangup. Leaving sounded like a good thing at the time. -How do you get along without working? -Just fine. --[LAUGHS] You steal from the rich to give to the poor? No, I steal from the rich, because the poor have no money. -Hm. How do you like, um, traveling with a-- a group like that? -You were going to say gang, weren't you? -Well I couldn't exactly call them the Young Americans! -I like being with them. I dug the freedom. No ties. Something new every day. Always on the move. -You like just drifting around? -I think "looking" is a better word. -For what? -If I knew that I would be looking, now, would I? -And her friend Eddie sees beautiful lady, takes her in his arms, and-- -And smothers her with baby oil. -(SARCASTICALLY) How romantic. -What do you expect from a girl at 10 o'clock in the morning? -I'll settle for a cup of coffee and a little conversation. -Got it. -You want me to do your back? -Oh, yeah. -I came by to see you a couple of times. But you've been busy the past few days, haven't you? -That's right. -How do you feel about advice from someone who's older, and who has been around a bit longer? --[SIGHS] To be perfectly frank, I prefer it from someone younger who hasn't been around at all. Their advice is usually a lot more fun. -Ann, you know you can't possibly have any kind of permanent relationship with a guy like that. -I'm not looking for anything permanent. Because nothing ever is. -Beautiful, you are. Practical, you're not. -I don't want to be practical. I just want to be happy. And I find that when I'm with him I'm very happy. -For how long? -Doesn't matter. Hey, you don't pass on happiness just because it might not last. You take it while you can. Cut, end of lecture. -By the way, where is Easy Rider this morning? -Oh, he went down to get some part for his bike. -That figures. -Where did you put that list? -Above the telephone on the wall. -Milk, eggs, peanut butter crunchy style, crispy critters, [INAUDIBLE] tuna, English muffin-- [MUSIC PLAYING] -What'd you forget? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well little lady, I'll tell you what he forgot. -We were just admiring your pad. It's really together. -Yeah, sweet little love nest you have here, man. Cool it! Cool it! You chick is fine, man! -Hey, hey, hey! Hey! We'll show you, man. Come on. Come on! Come on, we'll show you. She's fine. -Well, well, well. So this is what the C.C. digs, huh? -Oh, fragrance divine! A natural redhead, you suppose? Only her hair dresser knows for sure. [LAUGHS] -Miss New York Hotshot in all her glory. -To each his own. -Why Hello, my name is Miss Pig, and I'm the group recreational leader here. Would you like a dip in the pool? Badminton, bowling on the green. Anything you like. Don't you look lovely in your little frock! Oh! I used that for a bed spread last year, I think. Do you like that Lou? Straight from the Goodwill bag. Free, for nothing. Straight from the sewers, you think? Could you use me on the cover of your magazine? We'll we're just dying to hear your comments on our humble way of life, as compared to that of the fashion world. -How do you turn her off? [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] -Look at the citizen! Spiffing up your clothes for you now, man? [LAUGHING] Well, as you can see, we've taken very good care of your lady friend. And I mean it wasn't easy to get the guys to lay off of this. You know what I mean. But I persuaded the guys to lay off. I mean until I talked to you, at least. -All right, talk. -Oh, oh, wow! I mean, can you believe what the outside world has done to this child? Do you remember how polite he was when he was with us? Pom Pom went for a midnight swim last week. And when she cam back to get her clothes, the Club's money was gone. And so was C.C. Now, I mean it is bad-- I mean it is really bad enough to leave the gang and not say goodbye. I mean it hurts. But when you run off, and you take the gang's money, that is not a cool thing to do. -You want the $500 back, and the girl and I can split. Is that the deal? -Uh-uh, uh-uh. I figure it's now an even thousand. -A thousand? -Yeah. -OK, you let us split, and I'll have the money for you in the morning. [LAUGHING] -No way, man! You see this chick is what is known as C-O-D. I mean, you get her when we get the bread. -Where in the hell do you think I'm going to find that kind of money tonight? -Oh, I don't know. Go see your boss. I mean you're good for it. I mean, you know you're going to have to keep on whipping them freaks you call racers. -What you're saying is, if I was to race against a real man-- say, you-- I wouldn't have a chance, is that right? -Look, hotshot. If I was to ride one of them things you call a motorcycle. And if I was to spend some time on Motocross, man I would whip you and you know it! -Let's talk about a contest on a flat track with Choppers. I've never ridden flat track, and neither have you. You ride your hog, I'll ride mine. -I mean, what the hell is this? I mean what the hell is this? I mean I don't go to do nothing! You got to do something! -I mean you got to come up with $1000 by tomorrow morning. And if you don't-- -I dig how concerned you are with getting the boys their money, man. Let's talk about getting them $2000. -What? -A flat track race, like I outlined. Double or nothing. Why deprive the boys of an extra $1000. That's a lot of bread. Unless, of course you're afraid you might lose. -Afraid? No, moan, I just-- I just don't think you can come up with $2,000, that's all. -If you let me make one phone call, and I'll have the money for you in an hour. MOON: Crow, Midnight, go with him while he makes that phone call. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Charlie, I wouldn't ask for that kind of money if it wasn't an emergency. [INAUDIBLE] me out of a lot of trouble. You'll have the money back tonight. I promise. He's on his way. [MUSIC PLAYING] BIKER: $2,000, right? -Hey Rider, you don't get the inside lane that easy on old Moon. Listen, you flip a coin. -OK. Call it. -Heads. It's tails, man, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- -Hey, well I'll tell you one thing, man. This ain't going to work. I can't see a damn thing. Rabbit! Rabbit, can you see if you can find some lights? Hey Rider, you look a little pale. How you feeling? -Just fine. My mother always did want me to go to college. BIKER: Look, 10 laps, and anything goes. Now if your bikes give out, or you have to lay them down, then you can grab any other bike on the track. You understand that? OK. The first one to past me on the 10th lap is the winner. You both ready? You read? You ready? OK now, here we go. Start them up! [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES] -Hey! [INAUDIBLE] -OK, here we go! [WHISTLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTING] -All right! [INAUDIBLE] [WHISTLING] -Moon, get up! -Get up! Come on! [INAUDIBLE] -Come on, Moon! Hey, let's go get it. OFFICER: Hey, what's going on here? -Oh, nothing. -It's for the shot. -What are you talking about? -No, listen, it's for the shot. Now we're from the cinema. And-- and we're filming this here movie. -Oh, yeah, I didn't see any camera. Where's yours? -Oh, well, it's-- it's hidden. Uh, it's cinema verite. -Well, you see, sir, we got this here youth orientated, socially significant documentary satire on those raunchy motorcycle pictures. You know what I mean, understand? -Yeah, I'm mean it's-- it's a-- it's a cross between Antonioni and [INAUDIBLE] -Yeah. -Are you sure you have permission from Maroney and Keyworth to do? This -Oh, yeah. Old phony Maroney told me to hop to it. We're his A students. [LAUGHS] -Really, man, and if you don't believe it, you can just call him up and check. -Yeah, check! -You know, I think I will. And right now. Don't go away, right? -Oh! [INAUDIBLE] [SHOUTING] [CHEERING] [WHISTLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTING] [SCREAMING] -Oh, my God! [SCREAMING] POM POM: Oh, hurry! No! No! No! [WAILING] -Come on, Moon. Get up! Get up! Get up! -Oh, Moon! -Moon, no! POM POM: Oh, Moon! -Let's get him! [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] BIKER: Quick, quick, hurry! [INAUDIBLE] Help me, will you? Come on, help me! [INAUDIBLE] Oh, my God! [INAUDIBLE] -Where are we going? -I've got to get Charlie back his money, then drop you off. -And then what? -Then I got to split for a while. -Where? Remember we talked about looking for something? -Yeah. -Well I-- I'd like to look with you. For a while, anyway. [MUSIC - "SEE SEE RIDER"]
