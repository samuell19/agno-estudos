[♪♪] [SHOUTING] [SHOUTING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GUNSHOTS IN DISTANCE] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [ENGINE APPROACHING] Howdy, you all. My name is Benjamin Maxwell, and I represent the Petramco Corporation. And well, uh... comprende inglés? No, huh? Well, it'’s all, uh, here in these papers. You see, Petramco now owns this piece of real estate, and, well, you'’re going to have to clear out. [SPITS] Shit... We'’re going to have to show them a little muscle, boys. Stop! English... I'’m impressed. I'’m very impressed. Father sent me to the missionaries to learn about the white man. Great. Honey, you get your people on these trucks. I have a forest to clear. This is our home. You'’ve got five minutes to get on those trucks. If you stay, you burn with the trees. Now, get them on the trucks. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Where the hell are they going? Deep into the forest, to the river. [CHUCKLES] Well, sooner or later, the flames will find them. You know, it'’s a shame to clear this jungle. It'’s so pretty. But business is business. Let'’s go. Matadores... matadores de vida. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] No. No... You must let me go, Father. I'’m the only one who knows their ways. Joa... [SPEAKING SPANISH] Sí? Can I help you, sir? [LAUGHS] He does not speak your language. Oh, do you have an appointment with someone? Please, can you tell me where I can find the chairman? You mean Mr. Gaines. Well, he'’s either in his office here, or in Tokyo, or New York or London, but I don'’t see your-- And how do I get to his office? Up the stairs. Thank you. Uh, hold on. Just hold it. Where do you think you'’re going? To see the chairman. So you do have an appointment? No, but my father sent me. Well, that'’s nice, but nobody sees the chairman without an appointment. I must see the chairman. I'’m sorry, sweetheart, not without an appointment. Hey, hold on, Bigfoot. What'’s in the pack? Gifts for the chairman. Oh, God. Control, three here. Stand by. There'’s a small situation developing here in the lobby. What'’s your name? Nisa. Nisa what? What? What is your last name?I am Nisa. That is all. Okay. Hey, Bob. Can you check the register for a visitor named Nisa? Nisa?Yeah. Just Nisa. Nope, none here! No one by that name, huh? Nope. None all day long. I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry, folks. I'’m going to have to escort you out of the building, and I'’ll help you pick up your shells and your toys. [♪♪] [RATTLING] Ah! [GRUNTING] Hey, hey, hey, hey! What'’s going on down there? [GRUNTING] Relax. Gene? Gene, you all right? Take it easy, now. Be cool. Hey, hey, hey! Back off. Be cool. Take it easy. Take it easy. Just take it easy. Hey, hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Well, well, well... the little girl from the jungle. You. Now, hold on, sweetheart, you'’re trying to go places you'’re not wanted. Get up. Up, up. Come on. You okay? You all right? What the hell is going on here, Cutter? Officer, hold on to her. [SHOUTING] [VOICES ON POLICE RADIO SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [CAR STARTS] Mm? Oh, I'’m sorry. Did I wake you? I thought you were sick. No, I'’m all right. Mm... I'’m Carmen. I walk by this fountain every morning, but never before do I see you. What is your name?I'’m Nisa. [WHISPERING]: Do you have papers? [WHISPERING]: I had papers. The police have them now. There'’s only one thing that can straighten out this mess. Dinero. Money. I have no money. Child, you need help. I know. I'’ll get you a job. There is work for me? Yes, I think I could get you a job. Besides, you are young and pretty. They will love you. I'’m happy to work. What kind of work is it? WOMAN: Now, you'’ve seen the upstairs bathrooms. We have five down, one, of which is yours, of course. You can do with that as you like, but I want the others cleaned from floor to ceiling, including the toilets, at least twice a week. Are you getting all of this? Oh, I hope so, because the last Mexican girl we had was thick as a brick. I am from Brazil. Oh, we were there just last winter. We stayed at the, uh, Plaza del Sol in Rio. Beautiful place. Do you know it? Oh, of course not. Anyway, these are the downstairs bedrooms, they are for guests, except this one, which our good-for-nothing son occupies occasionally. [SIGHS] It'’s 3:00, Jason, in case getting up ever occurred to you? Out dancing all night. Whenever he'’s like this, you can skip his room. How will I know? Well, if you don'’t see him eating, it'’s probably safe to assume he'’s passed out in there. Now, this is the entertainment... [♪♪] [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GROWLS] Oh, God, you startled me. Oh, hello. Mm-hmm. Oh, I hired a new maid today. That'’s good. I hope she'’s better than the last one. Well, she seems okay. Oh, she'’s an absolute darling girl, and she does an outstanding job, but, well, I am a bit concerned about having her live here. Well, I don'’t want a thief in the house, if that'’s what you'’re talking about. Oh, she might pocket loose change if we leave it out, but I'’ll watch her for that, but what worries me is that she seems so... I don'’t know, different from the other girls we'’ve had. You know, she only had one small handbag with her. I'’m afraid she only has one change of clothes. Babe, I don'’t care what she wears as long as she does a good job. I just hope she takes a bath every now and then. Oh... Jason, where do you think you'’re going? Out. Could you be a little more specific? Dancing.

You said you weren'’t coming. So I changed my mind. So when did they start letting your kind into this club? She'’s with me. No, I'’m with you, and you'’re with me. Who are you? Iam his girlfriend.

It'’s just a stupid dress. Shut up! DAVE: Way to go, Anderson. Grow up! Then maybe we can talk. I don'’t know why you had to get me up at 2:00 in the morning. I mean, he'’s come in this late before. Couldn'’t we talk about this tomorrow? No, Bradley, enough is enough. It'’s time we had a serious talk with Jason. I'’m not gonna put up with him being out dancing night after night-- All right, all right, all right, I hear you. Here we are, home sweet home. Where were we? Oh, yeah. That dance you taught me back there. The Lambada. Yeah. Why do they call it the forbidden dance? Fifty years ago, the government of Brazil forbid it, because it was too sexy. Get out of town. Really. Yeah? Really. It has been fun, but the dress. Don'’t worry about the dress, all right? It'’s my mom'’s dress, and she'’s my mom. All right? I'’ll handle it. No sweat. I just can'’t take-- Okay. Jesus. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Good evening. Well, good night.Jason! We want to talk to you. Alone. Sure, Dad. I won'’t be long. What'’s up? What were you doing with that girl? We went dancing. Dancing? In my dress? You let her steal my dress? Mom, I stole it. Jason, that dress was just cleaned yesterday. Well, it'’s still clean, but it-- Clean? For God'’s sakes! Her perspiration will have soaked right into the dress. BRADLEY: That'’s gonna smell nice. KATHERINE: Oh, I don'’t even want to think about it. Look, Jason, you'’ve got to understand something. This isn'’t about a dress, or even about the girl. It'’s about-- Nobody saw us, all right? Jason, it isn'’t proper to date the help. You just don'’t do that. They'’re different from us. You can see that. Your father and I don'’t feel it'’s fair to us that you spend your time running in and out of dance clubs. Mother, I dance. I like it, and I'’m good at it. That'’s wonderful, Jason, but we want you to think about your life. Okay. All right, I'’ll think about it. And you'’d better do something about it or you'’re going to find yourself out on the street without a cent. Am I making myself clear? Yeah. And we don'’t want you fraternizing with the hired help. We went dancing, we didn'’t go to bed. Well, I should hope not. There'’s enough of those people in the world without you fathering any more. JASON: Will you try to keep it down, all right? She might hear you, Mom. I want her to hear me. And I want her out of my dress. About the dress... What about it? I hope you realize it'’s a Christian Dior original, and it cost me more than that maid makes in a year, so get her out of it. Okay. Okay, fine, all right? I'’ll get the damn maid out of your dress.

Sit anywhere you like. Look, I need to apologize for the other night, okay? I guess I acted like a real bitch. It'’s just that seeing you with that other girl made me really jealous. What do you want, Ashley? Well, for one thing, we need to talk about our audition for the Kid Creole Show. You'’ve got to be kidding. If we dance together like we planned, then we really have a shot at winning this contest. I mean, think about it, a spot on national television. Isn'’t that intense? Jason, millions of people would be watching us-- I don'’t think I'’m going to be dancing, all right, Ashley? Was there anything else? Jason, what is going on? I mean, we had so many good plans together, right? I mean, the other night is over, okay? Hell, let'’s just forget it. Let'’s just go on with our lives, huh? I want to make up. Jason, I have said that I am sorry to you. Now, what more do you want from me? Honey, I miss you. I miss you too. I just don'’t think it can be the same anymore. Why, Jason? Why? Just because you had a little fling with a street girl? Forget it. I can forgive you for that. Ashley, don'’t call her that. She'’s not a street girl. Yeah? That'’s not what I'’ve heard. What are you talking about?Nothing. What are you talking about?Jason, stop it! If you know anything about Nisa, you'’d better tell me right now. Stop it, you'’re hurting me! Spill it. All right, Jason, you know what? That little tramp is a professional. You know what I mean? If you'’ve got the bucks, she'’s for sale. Who told you that? Your friends, or maybe I should say your ex-friends. They found your little Chiquita Banana girl working full-time in a sleazy sex club. That'’s bullshit. Yeah? You don'’t believe me? Why don'’t you just go ask Dave? Or Kurt. Or Weed. After all, they each had a turn with her. Where is this place?I don'’t know! I don'’t hang out in that part of town. Damn it, Jason!

Immigration will send me home, and I cannot go back until I'’m finished here in this country. Who told you that? Mickey. She said if I did not stay, she would send me home. Who'’s Mickey? That woman? She lied to you. You don'’t have to stay in this place. Immigration won'’t send you back. I'’ll help you, and I have money if you need money. You don'’t have to sell yourself. It is you who does not have to sell yourself, because they already own you. Your parents own you. Ashley own you. Your friends own you. Is that now why you are here? Did they not tell you what I would do for you? So you see? We'’re not so different. You do what you must, I do what I must, and you... will be my first upstairs. Don'’t, Nisa. Please don'’t do this. Why not? It'’s only money. I said no. I'’m not gonna do this, and neither are you. I'’m taking you out of here. We don'’t offer takeout. I am leaving. Not to come back. You'’re not going anywhere.

Now...we can talk. We can talk. No! Get off of him! Yeah, we talking good now, boy. Am I talking good enough for you, boy? Nisa... Make him stop. Stop him! I can'’t. He'’s having too much fun. We talking good enough yet, punk? I don'’t think so. I'’ll do anything, just make him stop. Still talking, good enough? Huh? No! Yeah. [ROARING] What in the hell are you? I'’ll be back, punk. [BAG RUSTLING] My mama had a mojo bag... but you ain'’t my mama, boy. [RATTLING] Ah! [YELLING] Oh, no, you get away from me, you freak. [COUGHS] No, he'’s my friend. [SNAPS] Oh, that'’s good. Thanks. Who is that guy? He'’s Joa, our tribal shaman. What your people sometimes call a witch doctor. Get out of... town. A witch doctor in L.A.? Hey, that'’s better. Thanks. I don'’t think he likes me. He wanted to leave you here. He thinks you'’re not fit for me. Ha! You should meet my friends. What do you think? I think it'’s not up to him. [GRUNTS] Help me up. Who are you? I know your name is Nisa, but who and what are you? Sit down here. I'’m an Indian, Jason, from the rain forest of the Amazon. My father is the king of our tribe. Then you'’re a--? You'’re a princess? Among my people I am. My father sent us as ambassadors to the chairman of Petramco. They must stop killing the trees, or the sun will eat the air. You do not believe me. No, no, I do believe you. You'’re talking about the hole in the ozone layer, and this hole is getting bigger, in part, because of the burning of the rain forest. The sun willeat the air. Oh, this is bigger than you know. This is not only important to your people. This is important to people everywhere. And it'’s important to me. Petramco must be stopped, Jason. The rain forest is our ancestral home. We will not permit them to destroy it! Just hold on, all right? If you'’re thinking about taking on Petramco, you'’ve got a real war on your hands. If war is what it takes, then war it will be. Jason... I can'’t believe you'’re buying this. Princess? Jason, she will say anything she can to get you away from me. Honey, she'’s a maid. Ashley, you are so beautiful... and so common, and such a bigot. Jason-- Excuse me. Jason, she'’s lying to you. Jason, this is absolutely crazy! Jason, why are you doing this? I need you. Okay, princess. You want a war? You got one. And if the destruction of the rain forest continues at this rate, pretty soon this planet won'’t be fit to live on! You'’re being overly dramatic, son. No, I'’m not. It'’s the truth, and Petramco had Benjamin Maxwell run these people out of their land at gunpoint. But if Petramco owns the property, I don'’t see any reason why they can'’t do whatever they want with it, right? Well, they sure as hell didn'’t buy it from Nisa'’s people, and just because some scrap of paper says they own it, does it give them the right to round people up like cattle? That'’s wrong, no matter how much money you have. That'’s why we need your help, Dad. But are you suggesting that I set up a court hearing because a servant of mine wants to shut down one of the world'’s largest multinational corporations?I'’m not a servant. Her father'’s an Amazon king. I don'’t care if her father'’s the King of Siam. I do not want my son involved with an Indian princess from the jungle. You are both so close-minded. When are you going to stop going through life with blinders on? Don'’t talk to your mother like that! Who is this man? What is he doing out there? If you must know, Mother, he'’s a witch doctor, and he saved my life. Jason, if you need to go to a doctor, you can go to a real doctor, not a witch doctor. Stop him. What'’s he going to do to me? What is he going to do?No, Joa. no. Bradley, do something! It is a gift. What you may call a peace offering. He does not understand your language. He just knows that you are unhappy. Jason, this has gone on long enough. Then you'’re not gonna help us, are you, Dad? KATHERINE: For God'’s sakes, Bradley, do something. I want these barbarians out of my house. I want him and this girl to leave here this instant. BRADLEY: Jason, I'’ve got to tell you something. If you leave with these people, that'’s it. You'’re on your own. No more money, no more credit. You'’ll get nothing more from us. Who'’s the barbarian, Mom? [DOOR SLAMS] Thank you again for your help, Carmen. Mi casa es su casa. It'’s not much, but it'’s home. Oh, it'’s very nice. Thanks. I'’m glad for the company. When you telephoned me, I put fresh sheets on the bed for you, Jason, and I think Nisa and I will sleep quite well out here. I can'’t take your room. Nonsense. The sofa is too small for you. Now, what are we going to do about the doctor? Oh, yes. He'’s so quiet, I almost forgot about him. I guess he'’s the strong silent type. I, for one, am certainly not going to try to move him. Well, then, I think I'’ll hit the sack. Haven'’t slept much the last couple of days. Good night. Good night. Let me show you. Right through here, Jason. Straight down there. Thanks, Carmen. Good night. Good night, Jason. Get some rest. [MUSIC PLAYS] Mm, he is such a handsome young man, Nisa. You must tell me how you came to know him, unless you prefer not to say... [WHISPERS] in front of your guardian. He has sworn an oath of honor. Besides, he does not speak English. Carmen? Mm? Would you think me rude if I left you to say another good night to Jason? I would think you foolish if you did not. Go ahead. Your guardian will keep me company.

That money is no good to me if I can'’t help my friends. You'’re too generous, Carmen. Thanks, Carmen. You'’re a good friend. Hey, that'’s it. We'’ve got enough to buy Joa'’s plane ticket. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Enough already. You have proved yourself to be loyal as a saint and stubborn as a burro. Now, you listen to Nisa. One day, she will be your queen. This is her decision to make and you must do as you'’re told. Now, that'’s more like it. I'’ll even go to the airport with you. Thanks, Carmen. Here'’s the money. I have all the information right here. I'’ll take care of him. You have a way with him. I think he likes you. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Come along, Joa. Maybe you know your way around the jungle, but I know L.A., and I know city buses, and I'’m gonna make sure you don'’t miss your plane. See you later. Well, what did he say? He misses the silence of the jungle. What'’s wrong? Joa will tell my father that I will stop Petramco. I still do not know if I will. What we need is some leverage, and I had an idea this morning how we can get some. Come on, Jason. We'’ve got to get on that TV show and nail that guy. Well, then we have to win the audition. Come on, let'’s rehearse. [LAMBADA MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Lambada, Lambada ♪ Lambada, Lambada ♪ Lambada, Lambada ♪ Lambada, Lambada Benjamin Maxwell? Ashley? Ashley Wells. Get in. Well, I'’d like to thank you for agreeing to meet me here. Oh, no, no, no problem at all. Well, what can I do for you? I understand you'’ve done some consulting with my father, Winston. Wells Electronics? Well, it looks like you'’ve taken after your mother. Only on the outside. Inside, I am all Daddy. You must be one confused little girl. Well, hardly. Now, you'’re still the hired gun for Petramco, aren'’t you? What do you want? It seems we have a mutual acquaintance. A certain Indian princess. I know an Indian princess? ASHLEY: Oh, please, save your act for the unwashed. I know she'’s as big a pain in the ass for Petramco as she is for me, so... I thought it'’s about time we do something about her. Where can I find her? At this club, Creation. Jason and Nisa have been rehearsing here every afternoon. They'’re preparing a dance audition for theKid Creole Show, and if they make the audition, they'’re on national TV. I won'’t allow that to happen. Well, I didn'’t think you would. We can'’t let them go on TV and preach anti-American propaganda, now, can we, Ashley? [LAUGHING] What are you gonna do to her? Let'’s just say I wouldn'’t do anything you wouldn'’t approve of.

DAVE: You deserved to win. KURT: You two were the best out there. WEED: Definitely. You guys were definitely the best. And I also wanted to say I'’m sorry about the other night. KURT: Yeah, I'’m sorry too, Nisa. I acted like a real jerk, and there'’s no excuse for it, but I am sorry, Nisa, if that means anything. Well, your pain was bigger than mine. I knew you had it in you. I wasn'’t so sure. Oh, come on, guys, let'’s not get all teary-eyed. What about you? Aren'’t you sorry? Who, me? Yeah, you were there too. That wasn'’t me, man. That was my evil twin. How about a toast? Yeah.All right. Woo! Jason, Nisa. No. No? We'’ll pass. You guys aren'’t gonna have a drink with us? No, thanks. We'’ve got to do this again tomorrow night. Besides, I'’m driving. Jason, take it with you. All right. Later, guys. Salut.You two take care. You take good care of that little princess, okay, dude? What did I say? Jason. Jason!

All the greats and near-greats of entertainment appeared right here, one time or another during the course of their career. Oh, well, well... Like all beauty, it fades. It'’s been closed now for over three years, but I'’ve been thinking of reopening it. How would you like to star for me? Right here on this stage. Matador. Moi? Lovely to hear your voice again, Your Highness, but do you think you could do that in English? Music. [LAMBADA MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Lambada [SINGING IN SPANISH] I thought you liked this kind of music. It is you I do not like. What do you want? You... to audition. I will never dance for you. [SIGHS] Oh, yes, you will, princess, or you may never see your tribe again. I got you a little gift here. Look familiar? Show me the Lambada. All right, Your Highness... let'’s see what you'’ve got. The stage is all yours. Impress me. [LAUGHS] You call that rhythm? You'’ll never see Broadway, princess.

Your injury is serious. To restore your ankle, even for a little time, requires dangerous medicine. How dangerous? Don'’t worry, you'’re young and healthy. If we were in the jungle, Joa could do more, but here-- Nisa, how dangerous? Holy shit! [SHOUTING] [GASPS] Oh, my God. [CHEERING] All right, all right. Boy, do I have good news for you. While we were away for that commercial break, I got word that the dancers are okay. Give it up, give it up. So we will have Lambada.

All right. Where in the world did you learn those moves, my man? Nisa taught me everything I know. Nisa. That'’s an unusual name. You like? I love it. It means "princess of the forest." Mm-hmm. My father, he'’s the king of our tribe. He chose it for me. Hold it, your father is a king? Yes, would you like to meet him? I never say no to meeting a king. Sure. Padre. Is this a happening show or what? Now, we got a king. "Kid meets King." I like that. It'’s an honor, Your Majesty. [WHISTLING FROM AUDIENCE] That'’s the idea. I could have used two of you kings last night on a poker game. I'’m sorry, Mr. Kid Creole, but we must return to our home in the jungle at once... while it still exists. You live in the jungle? In the rain forest along the Amazon, but our home is being destroyed. That is why we have come to your country. We need help to stop the destruction. Nisa and her people are being driven from their homeland at gunpoint by the Petramco Corporation. The same Petramco that we find on the supermarket shelves? That'’s the one. We buy products they make every day. Not me, not anymore. The rain forest is too important. I say if Petramco is destroying the rain forest, well, then... we should just boycott their ass.
