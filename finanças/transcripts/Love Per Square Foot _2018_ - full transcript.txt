Subtitles by TSAMA Hey, do you know this plant? Datura metel. You know your stuff! Also known as devil's trumpet. It's really pretty. Gene, do you know anything about its true nature? It can kill people. I know that. It's amazing how it looks pretty, but it's poisonous. Good boy! You study so hard. Dad taught me. Is that so? Your allergy is acting up today. It's bad for your health. Let's go home. Yeah. Fujiko Mine's Lie Part One Dad, what are you doing? Gene, where's Fujiko? Why, why?! What are you doing to the house? I have no choice, Gene. We can't stay here anymore. Fujiko, I told you to look after Gene! They're here, Randy. Damn, they already found us. Fujiko, take my son and run. Why?! Gene, you can't come with Dad. Randy, will you be okay by yourself? Never mind that. Take my son... my only family. No! I wanna be with you! You can't, Gene. I don't wanna! Randy, hurry! I promise I'll see you soon. I don't wanna! Fujiko. Once you get away safely, meet me here in an hour. Please understand, Gene. Take him, Fujiko! Why?! No! Now go. Why?! Why?! Get to work. Bincam. Next is this man. Understood? Friggin' weirdo. Huh? Hm? What is it, Lark? The kid and the maid ran off. Tch! Tell me where the money is. I don't know anything! Suffer my curse. Gene... forgive me! Gene... forgive me! Dad! Go back, Fujiko! Where's the money? Died before he could say. Annual turnover of $1 billion? This company's doing pretty well. Godfrey Mining. A company that mines gold in the middle of South America. Word is, they do some shady stuff on the sly. Seems they bump off executives from competing companies, then bribe the police so their murders are never solved. Sounds like these guys don't need our pity. Your coffee is served. Is this a good time? Whelp... Nice job. We have a report from Lark. Randy has died. Never mind about him. Did they get the money? Every trace of him was destroyed. How much do you think he embezzled? $500 million! $500 million, huh? This much money is unacceptable. Randy's only son escaped with the maid. They may be carrying some sort of clue. Maid? A woman named Fujiko Mine. Did he say Fujiko? He definitely said Fujiko Mine. She's already on top of things, as always. Hey, how long until Dad gets here? He's already one hour late. He might not come at all. Why, why?! That explosion destroyed all of his evidence, and he was probably caught in it. That's a lie! Dad promised he would meet us! Randy is dead. Gene. Run to the car. Hey! Gene! Where's the money? Tough luck. That knowledge died with Randy. The $500 million is lost forever. Where's the money? Suffer my curse. Curse? Where's the money? In a bank... safety deposit box. What's the password? The password is... Don't tell him! Gene, are you okay? Snap out of it. Let's go. Gene! Lupin! Why are you here? It's rare seeing you with a kid. I'm in a hurry. See ya. Hey! Don't move. Only a creep hunts women and children. You got the boy to talk? Yes. It would seem the boy knows the password to the safety deposit box. Are you an idiot? If he knows it, then get it out of him! That's why I had you bring Bincam. Find him and make him squeal, whatever it takes. Take these. Rest a bit. What's going on? We saved him, but he looks like he's about to croak. He's fine. He'll settle down soon. Fujiko. Why are you with that kid? I work as a maid. I live a different life now. Ha! Enough with the jokes. He has a heart condition. So I'm taking care of him. Well, this sick boy's father was an accountant for Godfrey Mining. Is it a coincidence he embezzled $500 million from his company? What are you saying? It seems we think alike, Fujiko. Ow! You were after that company's money. That accountant, Randy... He's a bold one. $500 million's a lot of dough. It's for his son. He needs to pay for Gene's heart transplant surgery. It's also to fund their lives as fugitives. Hey, li'l boy.. Are you up? Mister, who are you? Why do you have a gun? Kids like you shouldn't know. Mister. Yeah? Do me a favor. The accountant's dead, so what happens to the $500 million? Well... I don't know the password to the deposit box. I guess we give up. You're giving up awfully quick. That's unusual. Hmm? Not necessarily. Your little client's calling you. Client? I want to avenge my father. Avenge... You mean that man from before? That man... My dad... If it weren't for him, my dad... My dad wouldn't have died! He said the reward's the password to the deposit box. No, Gene! What are you so worried about, Fujiko? I'm not worried about anything. I see. This kid has the key to the $500 million. A child like him wouldn't know it. I know it! So please... Avenge my father! Gene! Seems I'm right about the deposit box. Deal with one guy and get $500 million. Might as well accept, Lupin. Gene, are you serious? Yeah. Well, that's decided. That was quick. Fujiko, take care of the kid. Hey, stop making decisions for me! Lupin! Jigen! Sheesh! A tip-off? Yes, an anonymous caller said they saw Randy's son. It might be a prank. It doesn't matter, prank or not. Get Bincam to check it out! Understood. Jigen, I'm counting on ya. Hmph, you're too carefree... Using a child as bait... What's wrong with them? I'm fine with it, as long as I avenge my dad. I understand you're sad because your dad died, but this impulse to give up $500 million is ridiculous. Why? Forget about what happened. It'll just poison your life. I'll protect you. I'll also arrange your surgery. I'll be your mom. So stop seeking vengeance. Let's take the $500 million and run far away. Can't have you outplotting us, Fujiko. Why don't you tell your mom the password? Okay? Randy has died. No! I'll get my revenge! Looks like Fujiko's plans just fell apart. Can't sweet-talk or seduce this kid. Even that woman has a weak point. What's that? Some note Fujiko threw away in the apartment. Anything important? Nah... What...? I can't see all of a sudden. It's because this is a dry place. Talk about awful timing... Hey, it's him. Lupin... What're those guys doing?! Suffer my curse. Run to my car! Fujiko! The kid's with her. You boys stay right where you are. Fujiko, front! Front! We're going. Crap, we're losing them! Damn it... Idiot! I'm gonna squish him. That guy...! Back up, go after Bincam. Fujiko, that guy's still alive! Fujiko, it's him! It's him! We can shake him off now. Hang on! Fujiko Mine... That guy's up there still hanging on! Do something. My, you're pretty cute. Carla, Bincam's here. Aah, that feels good! That doesn't faze me! Beat me more! Nyaaa! Nothing personal, but my client will have his revenge. Who is that woman? Huh? If you wanna win over Fujiko, forget it. You can't outclass me as a rival. Fighting you is not part of my order. Suffer my curse. Curse? What are you up to? You will throw away your weapon. Bincam, patch up that right arm. I have no more fruit. Give me more. Patch up first. Lupin! Hey, Lupin! You okay, Lupin? Hey, Jigen. What the hell happened? Looks like I got cursed. Cursed? By that Bincam guy? Come with me. Huh? You sure you're all right? Hey, what about my revenge? Who knows? Hey, why... Are we stopping here? Yeah. What? I don't wanna stay at a motel! Just get out. Jeez. May I rent a room? That your kid? What, you think he's my lover? Naw. Kid or not, I charge the same rate. Of course. But I lost my wallet. Payment is up front. If you can't pay, go somewhere else. I'm not paying with money. Thank you. Gene, you take a shower, too. We have no money, but he let us stay. A child like you shouldn't worry. Show me your knees. All better. Don't touch it. Thank you. Say, Gene. We're in trouble since we don't have money. Won't you tell me the password to the safety deposit box? No. I'm avenging Dad. Hey Gene, listen. Be strong. Constantly holding on to the past is unmanly. Why? I'm saying this because I'm thinking about your future. Really think about it. You need a mom. A mom? You'll really be my mom? That's right! Because that's my duty. Forget your bad memories. You'll live with Mom now. Okay? Never mind that. Take my son... my only family. Dad was... Dad was... He was my only family. He got that money for my surgery. Gene. No! You're not my mom! You only got to know Dad just for the money, didn't you?! Gene! You're confused now. But you lied to the hotel guy! Just like you lied to my dad! At a time like this... Who is it? Let go! Hey, calm down! No! Sheesh! Ma'am, is something wrong? Oh, mister manager. Is he too loud? We don't want any trouble. Just a mother-son argument. We'll be careful. She's lying! She's not my mom! I've been kidnapped! Call the police! Sorry about this. Call them, call them! Hurry! Hurry! To repay you for all your troubles, I'll give you plenty of service. Little boy, get along with your mom. Put me down! Put me do- What're you doing, idiot?! Let go! Enough already! I'm all you have left! Shut up! Let me go! You're a child who can't do anything about your sickness or your future by yourself! Understand? Awful... The whole place is bombed. What are you checking, Lupin? I'm wondering about this house Fujiko worked in as a maid. That woman's always up to something. Aside from that... There's that creep that can blow dust storms from his body. Yeah. We took on a tricky mission. Hm? Sheesh... Like I needed more trouble. We're leaving. You're after the money, aren't you? Of course not. I'm just worried about you. That's all. We're out of time, okay? You have two choices. Leave here and live with Mom, or live alone under police protection. There's only one answer. We're going. I'm... This is the police. May I talk with you? Are you alone, son? Yeah. This is why I can't stand kids... Here? Why did the police go here? We're here. They're going to ask you some questions, so get off. Huh? Okay. To be continued Alright, off you go. Okay. Be good and do as you're told if you don't want to get hurt. Huh? Hey, thanks. Come. Raise your hands slowly and move forward. Fujiko Mine's Lie Part Two Lupin, look. Isn't that Fujiko's car? Bingo. The kid must be with her. Please show your ID. First spot to your left. 'Kay. Hmm... Sir, there's no note about the password. Hm. This company really is crooked. Bribing the police like that... You'll do anything for money. That's rich, coming from you. A maid who's only after money! Of course I want back money that was embezzled. Look at this. This company makes this amount, $5 million, every day. Our money can move the world. The world? That's quite a claim. Hmph. Gene, my boy, your father took our money and hid it. You don't want your father to be a thief, right? You're old enough to know right from wrong. You understand, right? You'll give our money back, right? No. I'm using that money for revenge. Hey...! Be quiet. Carla. Wake up Bincam. Yes. Wake up. Give me more. That's plenty. Aah! What're you... Ow! Let go! Randy is who he is. If only he just counted money. Now he lost his life after stealing the company's money. Bincam. Hurry up and get the password. Suffer my curse. You will tell me everything. Where's the money? A bank safety deposit box. Gene! What?! Gene, no! If you talk, you'll serve their purpose and be killed. You're going to avenge your dad. Your only weapon is your memory. My dear Fujiko. It seems you don't understand why you were brought here. Godfrey Mining is a clean company. Since you know we hired an assassin, we have no choice but to get rid of you. Bincam. Deal with her first. Gene! The president wishes to have you killed. Why? Bincam, was it? It seems you have the power to control people with a curse. Even so, you're fine with being a puppet for those guys? What are you doing, Bincam? Hurry up and deal with that woman! With that wonderful power... Don't you want me to become yours? What do you mean? I want to get to know a person like you. No backbone, like all other men. Bincam! I said hurry up and deal with her! You didn't come cheap! Now get back to work, you lowlife! Time for a cleanup. Hey, li'l boy. Doing well? Oh, the guy who can't do his job... At least you're honest. Hey! Gene! My backpack was right here! Backpack? Forget your backpack. Oh, isn't that it? There it is! Let's go. Take that and run! Fujiko! Leave the kid to us. Huh? Look at that creep. Looks like he's out of steam today. Good for us. The important thing is saving this kid. It's no use seducing Bincam. Fujiko, over here. We have no reason to save that woman. Oh yeah? And yet you're all too happy to save me. Shut up! Hey, he's looking this way. We're taking the kid! This is where we say goodbye. No way, after all that trouble rescuing you... You came way too late. Wha? We've been completely exhausted since yesterday. You leave this mother and child alone and let us rest. See ya! Y'see? Like I said, no reason to save that woman. C'mon, don't say that. Huh? What do you mean? What are you doing, Bincam? Hurry up and deal with that woman! You didn't come cheap! Now get back to work! Doesn't look like that president spares any expense. Huh? You stood strong. Was it scary? Yeah. But even though they threatened you, you said nothing. You did great. Because of what you said... You're going to avenge your dad. Your only weapon is your memory. It's true. You protected me. I'm sorry I doubted you. Well, time to rin- Whoops! What're you doing? Aah, that feels good. Gene, what are you thinking about now? What am I thinking? Why are you taking a bath with me? What's wrong? We have lots of room. It's my first time. I never took a bath together. With my mom. Not once? She died right after I was born. I see. So you lived with your dad the whole time. Yeah. No one loves you more than your dad. He's up in heaven sighing with relief, now that you're safe. I won't say I want revenge anymore. So... You're a good boy. That's a pretty fancy building. What is it? Godfrey diverts most of the company profits to this investment company. Investment company? Doesn't look like one. Of course not. That place is just a paper company, after all. Oh? What a surprise! Jigen, check this out. Huh? That guy...! Looks like an invisible string is beginning to connect all the dots. Here. Got it. Where are you going? Hey, Fujiko! I'll be back soon. Be a good boy and wait. It's dangerous, so don't leave the room. If you're hungry, call room service. You really will come back, right? Why are you silent? No! Don't leave me all alone! That's why I hate children. W-What? They know nothing about the world, yet they're selfish. They can't care for themselves. If they cry, they think someone'll protect them. If that's too painful, toughen up. Since you're a boy, you can wait by yourself. Yeah. I'll have that, too. Hey, Lupin. Not with the kid? I'm done babysitting. What, you're saying you got the money? I win. Looks like you don't feel like drinking, though. It's not like you to worry about that kid. Godfrey silences those who know that he hires assassins by killing them, even if they're children. Usually you just use men and then toss them aside. That child's not a man. He doesn't know any women or his mother. He can't live by himself. Just a child. You're a fickle woman, as ever. I don't want to lie about something I can't do. That's all. This Bincam fella's no ordinary assassin. Eh? Dunno who, but somebody set up a production plant that mass-produces assassins. The plant's funding comes from Godfrey Mining. Behind the curtains of the world stage, all the evils of the world are connected together. Then Bincam's also... So that's why... He has a strange curse. He's one tough enemy. Thanks for the warning. Who'll manipulate who, me or Bincam? Who would you bet on? Not an exciting bet if you already know the outcome. What's Fujiko gonna do? Hm? This time, we'll let her be. But our work isn't done yet. You cool with that? There's no money in it. Who hired Yael Okuzaki and Hawk? This doesn't just concern you. Sounds good. You're pretty whimsical, too. You're one to talk. Heh, that so? "I changed the hiding place of the $500 million. If you want to know where, come to the desert south of Randy's house. Fujiko Mine." This is strange. Why'd she write this message? Instead of running, she intends to fight. Stupid woman! Carla, bring Bincam. Yes. The president's calling you. Why... are you... I don't need you now. Naughty, Bincam. Use your power to get the location of the money from Fujiko Mine, then kill her. Nobody will bother us here. Me and you, we can talk alone. So, make me yours if you can. What's wrong? Aren't you after the money? You've got your special curse. You must obey the will of your master. Suffer my curse! You will tell me everything, then end your own life! Bincam. I know the true nature of your curse. Your sweat glands produce a poison which spreads through the dust storms. The scent of that poison is that of a plant in South Asia which can kill people. Devil's trumpet. The plant's fruit has a powerful poison said to be able to control people's minds composed of scopolamine. But that power only works in dry places. How do you...? Too bad for you. In fact, I know a lot about poisons, too. Also, the poison I put into you is starting to spread. What?! When did you...? Bincam, a human born and modified just to kill. But that one time, you hesitated to kill me. With that wonderful power... Don't you want me to become yours? What do you mean? No backbone, like all other men. At that moment, the poison I put into you had already spread. But you know, that poison only works on humans. That means you're not a killing machine at all. Your body and soul is human. You poor thing. You know nothing except how to kill. You were just a child who obeyed his parents' orders. There's nothing to be scared of. You have my sympathy. I will heal your dry heart. Now say it. Say that you want me. Well? You're... You're... The poison has started to spread. You're already my puppet. Tell me... How did... What poison did you use? I didn't use any. If you must know, it must be an aphrodisiac called "love." Love... What's... that? Rest in peace now. Why did Bincam kill Carla? How would I know? He's late, too! What's Bincam doing? We couldn't contact him. He's fired! Get another assassin. Yes. Mr. Godfrey. Don't put too much trust in the power of money. You bastards again! I got some questions about that assassin production plant you've been funding. Assassin production plant? What are you talking about? Stop playing dumb. We've been targeted by those assassins. I wanted to say hello to their client. Who's supporting you? Lupin, my boy. I have nothing to say to you two. A word of advice: Do not meddle with us any further. I'll take my leave now... Hey, four-eyes! Don't move until we're done talking. Yes sir! Mr. Godfrey. If we don't get an honest answer, we'll punch a hole in that snazzy suit of yours. A-Alright, alright! Don't kill me! I'm just doing their- "Their"? That's right. They- Hey! Who's "they"? Hey, answer me! Liar. Fujiko! Sheesh, doing something so rash by yourself... The nice girl act is done. May I have one? Godfrey's dead. You didn't need to do this yourself. I don't care about Godfrey. This is all one big drama. What do you mean by that? Randy stealing $500 million... Blowing up his house and all his evidence... He went overboard. Awful... The whole place is bombed. There was no evidence that Randy died. It was your plan to make everyone think he died, wasn't it? Dad! But you intended to con Randy out of all his money. Fujiko. Once you get away safely, meet me here in an hour. He's already one hour late. He might not come at all. You got Randy's kid to think he's dead so that you can get the password for the deposit box. I miscalculated two things. Bincam's skills as an assassin, and... ...the love of a son who wanted to avenge his father. But the kid's surgery money is now stolen. That's pretty cold-blooded. Oh, I don't think so. Randy should now realize he should never have left Gene alone. He was so focused on saving Gene that he foolishly exposed the boy to danger. Did you realize something as well? Something more valuable than money? Me? You're joking. If not, you had no reason to kill Bincam. After all, you have the money. I can always rely on all the men who'll never forget me, right? Like you. You said it. We men are all under the control of the woman named Fujiko Mine. Hey... Can I rest a bit? Yeah. Sweet dreams. It'll be hard to forget someone like you.
