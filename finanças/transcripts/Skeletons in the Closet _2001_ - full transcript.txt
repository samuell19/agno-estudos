The summer that I was six years old, my house burned to the ground. My mother died in that fire. I have no memory of that night at all. What I do have is the dream, and in my dream, my father set the fire. Well, the way I see it-- Hold up. That's my son's car. Is he all right? He'll be okay. They've taken him to memorial. We don't need that hose anymore. All right, roll it up. This one? Yeah. That's all I have so far. That's cool. Hey. Hey. Hey, Mr. Reed. Hi, Robin. I just came by to bring Seth his homework. Don't let me interrupt. I should be going. I'll see ya later. Thanks for the warning. Bye.Bye. Well, I'm waiting. Let 'er rip. I'm not mad at you. I thrashed your car. It's insured. Matter of fact, I got a call the first thing this morning from the agent. He said he wanted to talk about the accident. I need some coffee I know you're mad. I'm not mad, Seth. I'm gonna pay you back. That's not the point. Every last penny. Could we just-- We need to talk about what happened. I was drinking. I know. I grabbed the bottle before the police could find it. Gee, thanks, Dad. Was it because of the drinking, or did you do it on purpose? I skidded coming around a corner. What corner? The road was straight. It was dry. It was a clear day. It's all in the accident report. I just lost control. There were no skid marks. Even if you're drinking, you see a tree, you hit the brakes. You're not sending me to another one of your shrinks... 'cause you think I tried to off myself with a tree. Come over here-- If you call now-- All right, folks, step in here. I have an announcement. Our prototype skid has been selected... to ship gas turbines around the world. Guys, you all know we have a little tradition around here. Whenever a salesman comes through, his tie goes on the bulletin board... for all to see and worship. It was an ugly tie anyway, Will. How to prepare for the boss's party. Conjugate the word bored. I am bored. You are bored. We are all bored. Just keep pouring. Oh, that's it. You know that sale never would've gone through without your design. Welcome to the boys' club. They only put ties up on that bulletin board. I should make 'em pin up a pair of my panty hose. Now, I'd worship that. Yeah?Mm-hmm. You know what I think? No, what? I think we make a terrific team. Give us a toast. Here's to many more successful joint ventures. That's it? We put together a half-a-million-dollar deal, and that's the best you can come up with? All right, you try one. Okay, uh-- Here's to you. Here's to me. I hope we never disagree, but if we do, fuck you. Here's to me. That's beautiful. It's very touching. I think I feel a tear. you know what Dom Perignon said when he created champagne? Not a clue. He said, "Come quick. I'm tasting stars." I'm tasting stars. Oh, boy. Uh-- I think I had too much champagne. No, no, no, I was way out of line. I should never have said I'd worship your panty hose. I should've said that I'd respect them. Just forget it. I don't think I wanna forget it. There you two are. Come on in. Seth's gonna play the piano for us. Come on. Don't be modest. Play something beautiful. Does he get his talent from you? I've got about as much rhythm as a chainsaw. His mother was the artist. Hey. You know, I think this valve is shot again. Yeah. Can I talk to you a minute? What's up? Is your boy still seeing that psychologist? Why? Patricia found this in Robin's chester drawers. Robin said Seth gave it to her. He did? What's this all about? I don't know. What is that, a squirrel? I don't care what kind of animal it is. That's not the point. Patricia's upset about it. To be honest, I don't like it either. What do you want me to do, Dan? Talk to him. Find out what's going on. All right. Seth? Seth, you home? What are you doin'? I was looking for you. Looks like I'm found. You want to talk about the necklace, right? Yeah. Robin told me her nosy mom found it going through her stuff and had a meltdown. They're not real bones, you know?They're not? No. Made out of some type of cement. I bought it at that headbanger shop down the strip. Robin thought it was ill. What's the big deal? Nothing. No big deal. Can I get to my room, please? Sure. Ta-da. You guys look great. Ready? Here we go. Where is he? He's over there. This whole thing is ridiculous, you know? The music sucks. Seth? Hey. You okay? Huh?Yeah. Come on. I didn't get to dance yet. Come on. Let's go. Give it up for Seth. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Thank you. Robin? Come on. Here we go. He just freaked out, and he started yelling at me and calling me a bitch. You're full of shit. I didn't call you anything. You liar! He threw me out of the car. You fell, you skank. Shut up! I don't want to hear another word out of you! Two sips from the bottle and her paws were all over me. I said shut up! Go ahead. Tell me what happened. Well, it was really noisy inside. So we went out to talk. Talk? In the back seat? You wanted to do it! Hey! I'm warning you. You asshole. You creep. I hate you. Robin? Dad! Honey. You all right? You little shit. You stay away from her! You hear me! Goddammit! Dad! You keep him away from her! Dad, don't. Just take me home. I just wanna go home. Don't you evercome near her again. Whoa. What the hell's wrong with you? I need my medicine. You want your medicine? I'll give you your fuckin' medicine, huh! Wanna be a tough guy? All you can do is push women around. Is that what you like? Make the girls cry? I didn't do anything! You pushed her! I pushed her away! She got too close. I hate that smell. It chokes me. What smell? What are you talkin' about? Perfume. Man, I hate it when she gets too close. I told her to get out of my room. She shouldn't have touched me there. Look at me. What are you talking about? What are you talking about?What? Who came in your room? Seth, who touched-- Get the fuck away from me! Seth Reed is in the house, safe and sound. Where have you been? I drove to Portsmouth. Why? Never mind. It doesn't matter. We have to talk about last night, about your Mother. My Mother? You know, I was thinkin' about my Mother. I drove by where our old house was in Portsmouth. You know, the one that burned down. You know, I can't remember her funeral. I can't even remember my Mother's funeral. You were only six. You could forget a lot. Or make yoursel if forget it. That's what we need to talk about. About what you said she did to you. Did to me? Yeah, you said that she-- You said that she touched you. I didn't say that. I didn't say that. No, but that's what you were trying to tell me, wasn't it? Man, you are screwed up. You know that? Let me tell you something. She loved me. She would never hurt me. You just want to think bad things about her because you hate her. She was sick, Seth. No, you're sick. Know what I did in Portsmouth this morning? First smart thing I ever did in my life. Found a way to get the hell away from you, and Uncle Sam's footing the bill. I leave for boot camp in two weeks, right after graduation. America can rest easy now. The future of democracy is in safe hands. Don't do it. Just did. Hi, Will. Seth. We got a problem. Do you know David Duncan? Yeah, sure. He's in my grade. David didn't come home last night. They found his car on the logging road. His parents are starting to put together a search party. He's missing. David! David! David! David! David! David! See anything? David! They're down by the river! They found something! Where is he? Where is he? Let go of me! I want David! I want my boy! I want David! No! Let go of me! I want David! I want my boy! Afternoon. Afternoon. I'm looking for Seth Reed. Is he home? No, but I'm his father. What can I do for you? So you're Will Reed. That's right. Detective Carlson. Do you know when your son will be back? Has he done something wrong? I just want to talk to him. What about?I'm investigating the Duncan boy's murder. Why would you want to talk to Seth about that? The last place the victim was seen alive was Shannon's Pizza. Your son was also spotted there about the same time. Did you know your son was there that night? No. Well, maybe your son saw somebody suspicious hanging around there. You know, J.D.L.R.S, people who just don't look right. Sometimes people remember more than they think they do. They just need a little prodding. Yeah, I know what you mean. If you can give him my card and have him call me as soon as he gets in, I'd appreciate it. All right. I wasn't there. They said you were. Well, I wasn't. Why are you accusing me? Nobody's accusing you of anything, but you did drive there that night, so stop denying it. All right. Fine. I was there. You were? That's what I said. Then why'd you lie about it? Did you see David? Yeah, I saw him. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think it was a big deal. You saw that kid three hours before he was murdered. I think that's a pretty damn big deal. Was he with anyone? Do you mind? He was just sitting there eating pizza all alone on prom night, feeling like shit. You talked to him? I asked him if he wanted to drive out to the logging road and finish off my bottle. Wait a minute. You were out there with him where we found him in the woods? Why didn't you say something? Why didn't you tell the police? What do you think, Dad? That I killed him? Of course not. Yeah, that's what you think. No, I don't, Seth. Yeah, it is. Okay, I killed him. Don't even joke about that. I'm not joking. I grabbed a rock from the side of the river, and I hit him in the head with it. That didn't work, so I tried to strangle him with my bare hands. That didn't work either. All right, that's enough. So I stood on his neck, and I pushed all my weight against it. That worked. I said that's enough! I got a lot of studying to do for finals. You'll want to hear this. "Police have just charged Brendan Garst with first-degree murder... "in the strangulation death of David Duncan, "the Everett High School senior whose body was found last week. "Garst was arrested yesterday at his home... "for the brutal, bludgeoning death of his ex-girlfriend, "and last night, while under interrogation for that murder, he confessed to slaying the teen." You believed I did it. You weren't skeptical at all. You said you did it. I was at Shannon's Pizza, but I didn't see David there. Why did you say you did it? Why did you say you killed him? Wanted to see how you'd react. Now I know. You sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure. Who knows? Maybe the army will be good for me. Put some hair on my chest. Put some on your face, too. Thanks for the van. It's nothing. Listen, Seth--Oh, I forgot. I got you a present, too. It's not much, but-- Thank you. Well, I gotta get goin'. Hi.Hi. Brought the sketch. I made these adjustments for the new design criteria. That should bring us in line with the specs. Let me take a look at it and get back to you. Maybe we should talk about this. Well, let me run the numbers first, okay? I don't mean this this. Oh. That. This. That. Why are you making this so complicated, Will? We've been friends for four years. That's longer than my marriage lasted. That doesn't mean we know each other. Think I'm hiding something? Well, to be continued. We're on company time. You're not gonna take no for an answer, are you? No. Saturday I'm going to set the table for two. Say 6:00. The rest is up to you. You miss him? Not yet. Things were getting a little stressful. I think my parents threw a ticker-tape parade when I moved out. I could not wait to get away from home. And here I am, living in the same house I grew up in. It's strange. How'd that happen? Well, about the time my parents decided to retire to Florida, my marriage fell apart. I was devastated, just couldn't even function. Bought this place from them because it was so isolated. I wanted to be alone... and suffer. I took long walks in the woods, planted a garden, went fishing. And then a miracle happened. I started to notice things. How a plant I put in had a perfect little blossom. Or how the berries from my own garden tasted so much sweeter. It was like the past was too painful to remember, and the future was overwhelming. But when I concentrated on the here and now, the moment that I was living, there was always something beautiful in it. So that's what I started to do. Live in the moment. And I stopped suffering. I'm, uh-- I'm kind of scarred up back there. We all have scars. Morning, Heidi. Morning, Will. That's what happens. Happy Father's Day. Thanks, Seth. Come on. Come on. Open it. It's a ski jacket. Snazzy. Yeah, that's what it is. Nice. Oh! What? That figures. I told them a large. They give ya a small. - That's okay. I can exchange it tomorrow after work. - Sorry about that. Well, I am gonna do the girl thing and cut the cake. Well, the Army sure has changed. I don't remember enlisted men being able to wear ponytails. - You noticed, huh? - What happened? Well, it's just that the army and I had a little misunderstanding the very first day. It was decided It'd be best if we just went our separate ways. What can I say? You were right. It was a stupid move. Where have you been all this time? North Carolina. Just hangin' around. It was gettin' hot as hell down there, and it's not home, So I'm back. Hi. Can I help you? What's with the TV cameras? You wouldn't believe it. Some guy came shopping here yesterday morning. Then he disappeared. This is the last place anybody saw him. Was he from around here? Uh-uh. Tourist. It's so creepy. I had to be interviewed by the police, 'cause I was the one who helped him pick out a present for his dad. They wanted to know everything, but how much can you say about a small, red ski jacket? He seemed really nice. I hope he's all right. I'm sorry. Did you need some help? No, thanks. Shit. Shit.That's all right. Keep going. I am no good at this! It's all right. It's all right. Here. You have beautiful hands. Will says... your Mother taught you. Yeah, she wanted me to be a concert pianist. She started giving me lessons when I was three. Every day for two or three hours. I could read music when I was four. So you were a prodigy? You coming over to the house tonight? Yes. Does it bother you? I mean, I would never, ever... try to replace your mother. Do you know how she died? No. The summer that I was six years old... our house burned to the ground. She died in that fire. I have no memory of that night, but I do have this dream, and in my dream, my Father set the fire. Well, it's just a dream. What was your father like growing up? He was... fine. He was a good father. And your mother was fine, and your brothers and sisters were fine, and the whole family was fine, fine, fine. What? You don't believe me? They say every family is a dictatorship ruled by its sickest member. The trick is figuring out who that is. You hear about the David Alan Duncan case? Turns out the guy they arrested couldn't have done it. I thought he confessed. He confessed to a lot of crimes. He was a chronic confessor. But they figured out that he was in a mental institution under another name the night that David was murdered. Hmph. I'll be damned. Oh, by the way, I went to exchange that jacket today. They have the right size? Yeah, they did, but they said I needed the receipt to exchange it. Still have it, don't you? Since when do you need a receipt for an exchange? They said it was a sale item. You bought it at the Father's Day sale, right? That's right. Well, you can just get a check stub or credit card slip. Paid cash. Well, if you could just find the receipt then. You know, I think I threw it away. Trash pickup isn't until Thursday. All right. You need the receipt, I'll find the receipt. David Alan... Duncan. Mama loves her baby. Mama loves her baby. Mama loves her baby. Mr. Reed? Yes. Hi. I'm Amanda Hall. Hi. How do you do? Fine. Thank you. Two officers spotted the van parked behind the pharmacy. The license number matched the one you had reported to the police. Upon entering the building, they apprehended your son. A body search produced 50 capsules of Percodan in his possession. Thanks. I had trouble sleeping. Migraines. Doctor prescribed Percodan. I got hooked. The prosecutor is gonna push for intent to sell. What I'll argue is that you're an addict, not a dealer, and I'll try to plead down to breaking and entering. Well, I'm not a dealer. I mean, I don't have a record or anything like that. A rehab program will have to be part of the plea. But with any luck, it can be outpatient. Can I speak to my son alone for a moment? Of course. I'll be outside.Okay. You know they have the death penalty here? For robbery? I thought they just cut off your hands. Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? 'Cause I got a hot date with little Miss Briefcase out there to go over my plea bargain. I don't want to be late. You know, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately... about a lot of things that go way back. I've even started thinking about that dog. We never had a dog, Dad. The one we found, remember? You were about seven. Yeah, It'd been hit by a car or something, right? That's right. And I went to get help. So, Will, what is it about that dog that's got you so upset? Tell me. That was just the beginning, wasn't it? Yes, yes. The beginning of what? I want you to tell me what happened while I was gone. 'Cause that dog should've made it. What are you saying? That I killed it? You think I killed the dog? Plead guilty. Don't get probation. What?Let them put you in a hospital where they can help you. You want me committed? What are you trying to do to me? I'm trying to save you, Seth. Don't you understand? You need help. You're the one who needs help. You're out of your fuckin' mind. Aah! I can't stress enough that I desperately want to change my conduct for the rest of my life. I've been a heavy drinker since the seventh grade. Then I got addicted to Percodan. If it were not for that addiction, I never would've broken into that pharmacy. It was the climax of my idiocy, of the addiction controlling my life. I will enter a rehab program. I want to be sober and drug free. And, Your Honor, if you will grant me probation... and give me the opportunity to put this incident behind me, I promise you... you won't regret it. Please, don't let this one mistake ruin my life. Do we have an evaluation? It's on your desk, Your Honor. The presentence psychiatric evaluation showed the highest probability... that Mr. Reed will live a productive life if granted probation. Does the prosecution have any objections to probation? The state feels that's an appropriate disposition in this case, Your Honor. Very well. I'm prepared to rule. Your Honor, I'd like to have the chance to speak. - And you are? - I don't want him to talk. - I'm his father. Your Honor, my client requests that Mr. Reed not speak for the defense. Very well. Please be seated, Mr. Reed. Your Honor, please! Please, let me speak. Mr. Reed, approach the bench. What's this about, Mr. Reed? Your Honor, my son may have committed other crimes. What other crimes?Murder. It stands for David Alan Duncan. My son must've gotten it off of him that night. I've been wearing it around my neck for a couple of months. And he's been sending me other things. I don't know what to call them. Mementos. He sent me this watch... when he was living near an army base in North Carolina. While he was there, a Private was reported missing. And-- this ski jacket. Todd Milliken bought a red jacket at the Jack Frost Ski Shop. That was the last anybody ever saw of him. Then Seth shows up that same day with this jacket. Same brand, same size. I think this is Todd Milliken's jacket. He bought this for his father. That's why it doesn't fit me. It's like he's trying to suck me into this and make me a part of what he's doing. I think there's a part of him that really wants me to know, that wants me to help him end it. The first thing I'm gonna do is pay a visit to the Duncan's, get them to identify this necklace. They said it's not their son's. They're positive they've never seen it before. Call it a radical thought, but I think d-a-d stands for dad. As for the watch Seth mailed you, it's a completely common type. You can get it anywhere. We also checked out the Jack Frost Ski Shop. They sold 18 of those jackets that day. They figured at least six of them would have been red. Are you telling me that it's just a coincidence... that my son was in the same place at the same time that three murders were committed? One murder. There's only one body. The rest are missing persons. I spoke to a major about the missing Private in North Carolina. Army figures he just went AWOL. His bunk mate said he hated the army. He was always talking about skipping out. The kid from the Jack Frost Ski Shop has a history of drug abuse. Even his family admits that he has a habit of taking off for long periods of time, going on underground binges from Boston to Chicago. Look, this is good news, Mr. Reed. Your son didn't do it. You should be happy. Why aren't you happy? The prosecutor has informed me that there are no grounds for any additional indictments. Therefore, Seth Reed, under the first offender program for nonviolent criminals, I sentence you to five years probation under the following conditions: that you seek psychological counseling for a minimum of one hour per week for 10 weeks, that you enter an outpatient-- Yeah? Will? I can't believe I got you. I've been leaving messages for you everywhere. Listen, I can't talk now. - Will, I know what's going on. - What do you know? Everything. Seth called me. What's happening to you, Will? I'm all right. I'm all right. Just... tell me what Seth told you. He said... that you had accused him of killing somebody. The police proved he didn't do it, but you still think he did. What else? What else? He's worried about you. He thinks that you're unstable. Paranoid. He said that you... made up things about him being crazy. Do you think I want to believe this? He's my son, Tina. He's my son.Okay. Okay. Help me to understand. Tell me everything. Tell me. Is that why we're here? You're watching him? I have to go.You've been following him, Will? Go home, Tina. No. I'm coming with you. God, Will, slow down. He's gonna kill somebody else. - Will, stop. Stop it! - Go! Go! Come on! - Will! - Come on! Come on! - Damn! - What the hell is the matter with you? I have to stop him. Stay in the car. Don't get in that van with him!Hey! Oh, don't shoot. Please. I'm trying to save your life. Save my life? He was gonna kill you. You're Will Reed, aren't you? Yeah, I thought so. I'm the probation officer in charge of your son's case. I've been gettin' an earful about you. You wanna explain what the hell's goin' on here? I was just trying to... make sure he doesn't... do anything wrong. That's not your job. That's my job. You've already done enough. - You set me up. - He set you up? You're the one coming down here like a maniac. You listen to me, Mr. Reed. You're gonna stay away from your son. You're gonna stop interfering with his probation program. If you don't, I'll get a restraining order. Violate that, your ass is going straight to jail for contempt of court. Is that clear? Don't piss me off. All right. Good. Your son's got a job. He's clean and sober. He's tryin' to get his shit together. So just stay the hell away from him. Did you get my present? You know where those sunglasses came from? K-mart. I bought 'em. They're my sunglasses. I love fuckin' with you. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Do you believe me? I believe that... you believe it. Sorry. Can I talk to you for a minute? I know I had problems. I drank too much. Did drugs. Screwed up at school. Ditched out of the Army. I even tried to kill myself once. But I've started seeing someone. A psychologist. She's helping me start to see how my problems started, which-- well, that's the first step. The psychologist, she told me that, inside my head, it's like, there are these screens... blocking me from seeing the truth about the past. And the more screens I pull away... the clearer the truth will be. Can you face the truth, Tina? Do you feel that? Yes. Twenty stitches. My Father did that to me. I don't believe you. You don't think that people like my Father do things like that to their kids? I don't believe that Will would. I was six years old. I was taking a bath. He'd been drinking. I was playing with my toys. I guess I was splashing a lot 'cause he got mad. So, he just hauled off and hit me. My head flew back and hit the back of the tub. No. Why are you telling me this? It's the truth. I think I know him better than that. You never know what people are capable of, Tina. You think you know someone. People never really know each other. I still do not believe you. He did worse. He'd come into my room at night-- I don't wanna hear any more. I don't wanna hear any more. I wanted him out of my room, but he said I was the bad one. I was the filthy one. And that my Mom was bad, too. He'd say that to me about her all the time. She was dangerous. That he needed to protect me from her. I think he believed it. And that's why he killed her. He set that fire. No. No. It is not possible. It's not possible. I'm telling you the truth, because I don't want anything to happen to you, Tina. That's the only reason I'm telling you. Before this thing goes too far with you and my dad. No. Tina? Honey, are you okay? No, I'm not okay. What happened? It's time to get everything out in the open, Will. I don't believe you've told me the truth. I want to know everything. I want to know about your wife... and what happened to her. What did Seth tell you? This isn't about what Seth told me. He said terrible things. I wanna hear it from you! Okay. Okay. You're right. I didn't tell you the truth about my wife. But I want you to understand something. I did what I had to do. She was dangerous to Seth. I had no choice. What did you do? You think knowing the truth will solve everything. That you can fix anything with the truth. But you're wrong. The truth will not set you free. I don't care. Hold on. Will? Will-- Can somebody help me please? Hi.Hi. You're going to be just fine. Tina, listen to me. Everything makes sense now. What? At Shannon's, there's a machine that turns copper pennies into medallions. David Duncan made the medallion, with his initials on it, the night that he was murdered. That's why his parents didn't recognize it. They never got a chance to see it. I don't know what you're talking about. Seth did this. He poisoned your drink. Poison? Did he do it, Will? Or did you? What the hell are you doing? What are you doing here? Christ, you almost killed me with that thing! What's the matter with you? I thought you were Seth. I thought you were Seth. What's goin' on here, Will? You haven't been to work in two weeks. Listen. Listen to me. You were right all along. Right about what? You know that necklace that Seth gave to Robin? The one made of bones? Well, they were-- they were real. He kept the bodies up in the eaves. He takes them with him wherever he goes. See, that's why there's no bodies. No bodies, no murder. It's just a bunch of missing kids that nobody cares about. And you see this powder? This is lime. That's what he uses to get rid of the smell. He's hidden them somewhere. I gotta find them. Will, you need help. Serious psychological help. Dad! I came as soon as I heard. Is she gonna be all right? Seth! Help me up. Seth, please! Help me. - Why? You killed her. - Seth-- I didn't kill your Mother. I didn't kill her. She's alive. Your Mother's alive. Please. Please. Where is she? Mom? Oh, my God. It's been so long. I knew, one day, that you'd walk through that door. Oh, don't do that. No, don't be sad. Everything's gonna be all right. I hate it when you're sad. You remember how Mama loves her baby. Mama loves her baby. Mama loves her baby. Mama loves her baby. Loves her baby Is it soup yet? Relax. The Percodan has kicked in by now, hasn't it? Should make you nice and drowsy. Before you drift off, can-- can we play a game? 'Cause... I think I had things a little backwards, didn't I? But see, my Mother removed another screen. Now, everything's clear. I never hurt you. You know that now. It was her. You were worse than her. You let it happen. You left me alone with her. Come on. Let's play. Seth is five years old, you come home and find his-- his little head in a bandage. What do you do? If you're gonna kill me, do it now. Wrong answer. Sorry. I'll give you a little hint. You don't do Jack shit. Why didn't you do something? She said it was an accident. That you slipped in the tub. I was out of the country. You were always out of the country back then. It was my job. How about the time... you came home´and little Seth's arm was in a cast? What about that, huh? She said you fell off a jungle gym... and I believed her. You knew. No. You knew! No. Don't fuckin' lie to me. You could've saved me. But you didn't give a shit. You could've saved me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Do you know what she'd do to me... before she'd hit me? Like the day of the fire? It was right after my birthday party. You'd just left for another one of your... business trips. It was just me and Mom. All my new presents in the room. Daddy's gone... and it's just you and me. Hmm. Mama doesn't need Daddy anyway. Mama only needs you. Mama loves her baby. When she was done... she said that I made her do it. That I was dirty. I was filthy. It was my fault... that it happened. When she left, I heard her lock my door. Mommy? Mommy? Mommy, I can't open the door. Mommy! Mommy! Come on. Hey. Don't-- don't be sad. I hate it when you're sad. Everything's gonna be fine. Mama loves her baby. Mama loves her baby. But... he's dirty. He's filthy, and he should have died in that fire. What did you say? Huh? I love you. I came back! I saved you! - Daddy! Daddy! - Seth! Oh, God! Take him! Take him! Y-you should've let me die. You should've let me die! I imagine that, when I was born, my Father felt that unconditional joy of a baby's birth, because he didn't know then that what the future would hold for his child, for any child, is an unanswerable question. The summer that I was six years old, my mother locked me in my bedroom and set the house on fire. I don't dream of that night anymore. But I still hear her voice. "Mama loves her baby. Mama loves her baby."
