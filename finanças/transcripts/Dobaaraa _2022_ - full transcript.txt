What the future holds Will soon be the past What the future holds Will soon be the past Cherish each moment… Alright, sir. We're closing. Time to go home. Rush home, dear. There's a storm coming. It will blow you away. Hurry! Good evening. Here's today's detailed report. According to the latest reports from the Weather Department, the cyclone that originated from the Indian Ocean is rapidly advancing via the Arabian Ocean towards the Western Ghats. The Weather Department has issued a red alert to all the coastal regions. Weather experts say that it's tough to predict its course… Because of the unusual nature of this cyclone. Mom… Didn't Abhishek show up? When did you go out? I asked you before leaving. You were sitting right here! I've told you a zillion times, to not ask me questions when I'm busy working. I will end up saying yes to everything. Did you see the weather outside? There's a warning over the radio. Well, I'm back alive. What are you doing? The hospital's construction has already begun, but it's just your designs that are pending, right? I know it. Now stop bothering me. Go set the plates. And then we'll have dinner together. Okay? Okay. Mom… Did Dad call? No, Anay. Don't ask the same question everyday. It is the way it is. Okay? Dad isn't coming anytime soon. And… I've asked you to not wear a cap inside the house. Now go. Smile, Anay! I'm recording a video of us. It's not just a picture! How about this? Do you know something? You see this young man right here? He'll be seen in the outer space soon in his astronaut suit. In search of a new world. Thank you, Dad! Love you, son. Okay, now give me a big smile. Yes. Perfect! Come on, now let's have lunch. No, let's go swimming first... You still want to go out? Your mom's crazy, right? - She's always complaining. - Hey! I'm sorry, Mom. What's the point of apologizing now? You might get a fever now! Then you'll miss school, and I'll have to sit at home nursing you. Come on, Mom! Hello, Dad. How are you? I miss you a lot. - At least hear me out! - Let go of me! Rujuta, stop it! Mom… No, please… Listen to me. - He's my friend… - Hear me out… Let go of me! Mom! Mom! Mom! A fight is taking place at Raja Uncle's house. Go back to sleep. Who are you? Hey! Anay, stop! Listen to me, Anay! Mom… Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! - Mom! - What happened? What's wrong? Relax. What happened? You had a bad dream? Tell me? She had another bad dream. She wet her bed again. Is she fine now? Sorry. There are inventories every Friday. Security is necessary. It's only your hotel who has inventories every Friday. I've tucked Avanti into our bed. You can sleep on the couch once you're back. Listen, I was thinking we could unpack everything tomorrow. And then invite Sheela Auntie and Abhishek for dinner. Okay, I'll call them over. I'll get going, Auntie. I'm running late. Make sure you eat something. It's the same storm again. The last one went on for three days. I wonder how long this one will… Auntie… I'll be home late. Please eat something. Okay? Good morning, Captain. There's nothing good about this morning. Flying in bad weather is equal to getting cursed by the passengers. Come on! Please be positive! You're always complaining. Would you have not rejected me if I was positive? - Hi, Uncle! - Hello! One needs to apply first to get rejected. I didn't receive any of your applications. Can I apply now? Dump Vikas! He's far more negative than me. You're flirting with me in front of my daughter. Do you have no shame? Actually, why don't ask me out in front of him tonight? We're hosting dinner at eight. Why don't you settle in first? We can have dinner later. We'll do the housewarming first and then settle in. And anyway, Vikas is making his famous Risotto. I better eat out. So mean! Hold on. Sheela Auntie! - We're hosting dinner today at 8:00 p.m. - Hi! Please come over, okay? She didn't hear a word from this distance. But you did. So better show up tonight! Geomagnetic storms don't just disrupt radio communications, or radio navigation alone. The mobile phones we use, the internet, cable and even the radars get affected. In such conditions, flight takeoffs should be completely shut down. Not only technology, but it even affects our blood flow. Especially our blood capillaries. It can cause high blood pressure, and a sudden boost in adrenaline. We already know the effects of such geomagnetic storms. But there are many possibilities that are yet to be discovered. Jump! - Kshitij Jain! - Yes, sir! One, two, five! - Avanti Awasthi! - Yes, sir! One, two, five! - Shiven! - Yes, sir! Ma'am, how did the operation go? - Is my husband okay? - Please calm down. I'm just a nurse, not a doctor. - No one is telling me anything. - Have a seat. - Which side are you going to incise me on? - We'll see. What if it gets septic? Don't worry. It's a routine procedure for Dr. Sethupati. You're in safe hands. Thank you for listening to me. Your intuition will be put to good use here. Working with Dr. Akbar… Must have been a nightmare. I've been wanting to assist you since my college days. And I've got the opportunity now. You were the one who let go of the opportunity. I wanted you then as a surgeon in training. I wish you had listened to me. Antara… You should've been doing this procedure. It's okay, sir. I have no regrets. I'm happy. Really, I'm happy! Let's go! How are you, Mr. Ranjit? - Good, sir. - Good? Sir, where are you going to incise me? You did it yourself or got someone to help you? What are you doing, Mom? What are you doing? Come sit with your mom. Come on. Right here. Mom, where is Konkan? Konkan… Konkan is 14,400 seconds away. Very far away. Why? Because people's houses were blown away in the Konkan. Storms cause a lot of houses to get blown away. They fly off like airplanes. You know, when your Dad and I were young… There was a similar storm. It was very severe. Our homes got blown away. Is it true, Dad? Yes! It's absolutely true. Houses were blown away, trees were uprooted, and it rained so heavily that day, that we had to take a boat to go eat ice-cream. - Really? I also want to get in a boat… - Yes, really! I want to go get ice-cream on a boat as well. We will surely take you out to eat ice cream on a boat. It's because, you're always going to be safe with your mom and dad. Also, don't forget you have this safety star with you. - Here, look. - Safety star! - Yes. - Now, go and get snakes and ladders. Let's play it together, okay? - Okay. - Go. I was in Goa when the storm hit in 1996. I was at Uncle Anup's place. A tree fell on our house. That was the first and last time, I saw a lightning strike so closely. It just hit the road. Such a sight, I tell you! Vikas, I can't do this anymore. What do you mean by that? Earlier, even your nonsense was music to my ears. But now, the moment you speak, I want to plug my ears. You irritate me now. You really want to do this? Listen. Let's wait another month… For Avanti's sake. Mom. Coming. Mom, is this a microwave? No sweetie, it's a TV. Vikas, whose is this? How did it get here? Sit here. - It's still working. - Yeah. Do you know what this is? - What? - It's a video camera. When we were your age, we used this to record everything. Back then, mobile phones didn't have cameras. Mobile phones didn't even exist then. Right. We didn't have mobile phones. - Yeah. - How did you guys talk without mobile phones? Let's see this. "Lake Picnic." - It's working. - Yeah. Look here in the camera. Smile. And you can see your mom's building from here. You see this young man right here? He'll be seen in the outer space soon in his astronaut suit. In search of a new world. Thank you, Dad. - Love you, son. - Smile. Who is he? I don't know, sweetie. - A boy? - We saw him for a couple of seconds. But strangely he was sitting in the same room as us. That's taking it too far, Antara. You figured out it was our room in just a couple seconds? We all did. It was the same room. He was sitting on the bed, right? I saw him as well. Really? You saw the room? Eat your food. Let's not feed the imagination of a seven-year-old. She's not seven, Vikas. I am six. This risotto is delicious. He's been making this since his college days. He takes a pot of boiled rice, melts some cheese in it, then adds some truffle oil to it and calls it "risotto"! He's a one-trick pony. This is Anay's TV. He used to watch his father's cassettes on it all day. Where is he now? Actually… He's no more. His dad lived in Dubai. I don't think his parents were together at the time. But we didn't know back then. I'm sorry. Anay was my… He was my best friend. We came in here everyday… And watched The Terminator. There used to be a poster of The Terminator right here. You see that house? Back then, a murder took place there. In the year 1996. There was a similar storm that day. Abhi… Not now. I was just telling them about the incident. You can tell them later. They bought this place, and they have the right to know what happened here. What difference will that make? They've already bought it. What's the point in telling them now? You can go home if you don't want to hear it. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. Whenever I talk about him, she shuts me up. Abhishek, enough! He is my friend. I'm… I'm sorry. You guys carry on. I'll get going. Wait, Sheela Auntie! We won't talk about it. Let it be. It was a stormy night. A transformer had blown up. There was a power outage in the entire area. For two days… I remember our school was closed. She's been like this since that day. Raja Uncle and Aunt Rujuta lived in the house next door. They were close friends with my auntie. Look at this. He should have informed us about it before we bought this place. It happened ages ago. It must've slipped his mind. How could he forget such a thing? Anay was his best friend. He must've kept it from us on purpose. What else is written in it? Saraswati Sugar Mills GM Raja Ghosh, sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment for killing his wife. If Anay hadn't witnessed the murder, and met with an accident later… Raja Ghosh would have buried his wife's dead body next to the sugar mill's spray pond. Can you believe that? How do you know this stuff? It's written in this article here. Raja Ghosh admitted everything in the court. - Then he must be in jail. - He killed himself in jail. Just look at him. He looks like he's a decent man. Even you look like you're a decent man. What do you mean? I mean… One can't judge a person's decency from the way they look. No one could tell that Charles Sobhraj was a gangster. Hello! He wasn't a gangster. And you're not decent. What's this? And who does this key card belong to? It's the key card to the hotel's guest room. Whose room? It might belong to a guest. They must've forgotten to return it at the reception. So, they gave it to me instead. And it remained in my pocket. I wouldn't lie to you about something like this, Antara. Hello. Hello. Who are you? Why are you on my TV? Can you see me? Yes. Are you talking to me? Who… Are you? Is your name Anay? Yes. Who are you? Antara. What are you doing on my TV? You're on my TV. But I'm in my room. I'm in my room as well. How do you know my name? Abhishek told me. How do you know Abhishek? He's a friend. College friend. But Abhishek is my classmate. We study together in class six. He's my friend. Rujuta, hear me out! Stop it. Anay… Anay. Anay, what's going on? Rujuta, don't do this. Someone's fighting at Raja Uncle's place. Mom! Anay, don't go there! - Mom! - Anay, don't go there. Mom, someone's fighting at Raja Uncle's place. Anay, listen to me. Anay, come here. Wait. Stay here. Anay, listen! Don't go there. Don't worry about what's happening there. Just stay here. Tell me the truth. How are you doing this? And who are you? My name is Antara. I work at the Blue Cross Hospital. And I'm living in your house. Look around. This is your room, right? Look at this. Here! Your favorite movie poster used to be here, right? Do you see it? Blue Cross Hospital? - But it's not even constructed yet. - It is. - It was ready in 2010. - In 2010? Which year are you in? I'm in the year 1996. Are you from the future? Like the Terminator? - Yes. - Leave me! Anay! Don't go there, Anay. But someone's being attacked. Auntie is screaming as well. She needs help! You cannot help them! Whatever's going on there is not your problem. Stay right here. Don't go! You'll die if you go there. A fire brigade will run over you and you'll die. Wait here. Don't go. You'll die if you go there. Okay, hold on. Let me show you something. Stay there. Don't go. Look at this. Do you see it? That's Raja Uncle. Yes, that's him. He's dead now. He's no longer alive. Read this. "12-year-old murder witness dies in an accident." This is you. You got run over by a fire brigade! What is all this? It's a news article from 1996. No, I mean… What are you holding? It's a laptop. It's a computer. Listen to me. The Terminator is your favorite movie, right? There were two terminators from the future, right? One of them came as a savior and the other to kill. I'm from the future as well. I'm here to save you. If you were alive, I wouldn't be here in your house but you would. So don't go to that house at any cost, Anay. What had to happen has happened, Anay! There's nothing you can do to help! Anay! Anay! Listen, Abhishek told me that your school will be closed for two days, due to a blown transformer. Please listen to me! Don't go! Hello. You asked me to wake you up in the morning. The patient has been prepped. Are you coming for the procedure? What's the time? It's 2:15 p.m. Shit! Okay, I'm coming. Shit… - Hello? - You're coming, right? Yes, I'm coming. Are you okay? Yes. I'm feeling a bit sick, but I'm on my way. I think you drank a bit too much last night. I wasn't drinking last night. You told me you were heading home. If I spoke about getting home, how did I get here? You took a Quick Cab yesterday. A cab? What are you saying? Your car broke down. We called a mechanic. I have the keys. There's no one in this house either. I'm coming. I don't know how long it will take but I'm on my way. Ma'am, are you okay? Not only technology, but it even affects our blood flow. Especially our blood capillaries. It can cause high blood pressure, and boost the adrenaline. We already know the effects of such geomagnetic storms. But, there are many possibilities that are yet to be discovered. Good morning, doctor. Good morning. Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! You're the reason my husband is alive! You're no less than God. - What have I done? - Hi, Dr. Vashist! Hi. Good morning, doctor. Where will they incise me? Tell me. Wait a minute. Wasn't his surgery done yesterday? Dr. Vashist, he's Mr. Ranjit. He was admitted last night for the procedure. Didn't Dr. Sethupati operate on him yesterday? No, doctor. His operation is scheduled for today. I'm taking him to the OT. Why is everyone addressing me as a doctor? Listen, when did I have a haircut? Your hair has always been the same. Wasn't it longer? No, ma'am. It was exactly the way it is. Why are you calling me ma'am? Everyone is addressing me as a doctor and you're calling me ma'am. My nose ring is missing. What nose ring? The nose ring that I wear every day. - When did you get a nose ring, ma'am? - Why are you calling me ma'am? - I'm... - Ma'am, what about the procedure? Do we need to keep the patient alive, or kill him? If you want him dead, I'll conduct the procedure again. I've never done a surgery independently. I can only do sutures. Where is Dr. Sethupati? In his cabin. Good morning, this is Me era and welcome to the Daily Weather Report. A low-pressure zone seems to be forming above the Arabian sea, which may lead to heavy rainfalls in the western ghats in the next few days. The Weather Department has issued… Doctor, may I come in? Dr. Sethupati? Don't forget that you have this safety star with you. - Look. - A safety star? Yeah. Avanti! One, two, five! Avanti! Avanti… Avanti. Where's Avanti? What name did you say? Avanti Awasthi. She's six years old. Hold on. - Have you seen Avanti? - No ma'am. - Orange floaters? - No. - Does anyone know Avanti? - No, sir. Sarah, Akshay, Kshitij… Sorry, ma'am, but there's no one here by the name of Avanti. Let me see. How is this possible? I drop her here everyday, sir. There's no one by that name here. Avanti… Why aren't you swimming? Who is Antara? Who is Antara? Your friend. Are you out of your mind? What's the matter? Why aren't you swimming? Mom… Something weird happened at Raja Uncle's house last night. How do you know that? I saw it through our window. There was someone fighting at Raja Uncle's house. And I also heard a woman scream. And then the lights went off. Rujuta? But isn't she traveling? No, Auntie, I saw her. But the electricity went off due to the lightning. Rujuta is here. Even I saw her sitting in the car. Then I heard something break, and then a loud thud. I'll go and ask. Okay. Now go and swim. Sir… How are we going to do it? - Rukmani. - Yes. Take him along and question the swimming teacher. I'll handle her. But sir, what do we ask him? Ma'am's filed a complaint, right? Go and question them. Go on. Go. Someone cut my hair, my nose ring is missing, in fact, even the piercing's gone. - I can't see clearly without glasses... - Hi, I'm here. Let's meet over there. - Coffee? - No, I don't drink coffee. Your daughter… Sorry. - Avanti. - Avanti. When was the last time you saw her? When I tucked her into bed last night. Why are you staring at me? Listen, if Avanti wasn't frequent here, how would I know that his name is Kapil? Because that man right there, has his name written on the board. Does the board also say that the swimming teacher says "five" instead of "dive"? Ma'am, we've done our investigation. There is no one named Avanti registered here. You're a doctor, right? I'm a nurse. Well, then I'm sure you know that nose piercings don't disappear overnight. Look, I don't have time for your sarcasm. My daughter is missing! What will I tell Vikas? It's my responsibility to get her here and take her back home. Are you sure you dropped her here? You said you woke up at someone else's home, and went straight to the hospital. So when did you drop her here? Before going to the hospital, or after? Vikas must have dropped her here. He does that when I'm busy. So call Vikas. Ask him. Someone deleted his number from my phone. And I'm guessing you don't remember his number. I don't remember every contact number. Is it a crime? Do you remember every single contact? Okay. What's the last thing you remember? The last the I remember is that last night… We had invited some friends over for dinner. The lightning was scaring Avanti, so I tucked her into bed. After that… There was that boy on the TV. What boy? Vikas Awasthi? Sir, he's in the security room. Excuse me. He's the head of security here. Vikas, did you drop Avanti to her swimming class today? I'll call you back. Yes? Did Avanti go for her swimming class or not? Avanti? Who's Avanti? Vikas, please don't screw up my mind. I've had enough for today. I'm confused if it's you fooling around or Abhishek. Please relax first. Do you want water? I'm not here to drink water, Vikas! I can't find Avanti! Are you staying in this hotel? Have we met before? May I know what's your name, if you don't mind? DCP An and. You don't know her? Why? Is she famous? Please, this is getting a little too much. - Please. - Please, what? I'm saying that I don't know you, but you're not understanding it. What's going on? You said you've quit smoking. - And... - Excuse me! I'm being polite, but you don't seem to get it! You just keep insisting about me knowing Avanti. What's happening? I don't know what's… What are you talking about? - What's going on? - Ma'am… - Who are you? - Ma'am! Please, wait outside. I'll talk to him. Ma'am, Please. Rukmani, please come here. Escort ma'am outside. - Is this a prank? - Ma'am, who is Avanti? - Ma'am, please! - How do I know you? Ma'am… Sorry, ma'am. So, you don't know Dr. Vashist at all, right? Dr. Vashist? Yes. Dr. Antara Vashist? Yes, Dr. Antara Vashist. Oh my God! Dr. Vashist saved my life. Yeah, she… She saved my life. What is your name? Yes, ma'am? Sara Kunder. Can I help you with… Never mind. Ma'am… Ma'am! Ma'am! You're joking with me, right? Bhavna? Antara. - Wait. - I don't know what's happening. I seriously don't know what's happening. Is what I remember a dream, or is this a dream I'm living in? I don't understand. I know that I'm a nurse. I changed my name to Antara Awasthi after marriage and I've a daughter whose name is Avanti. Vikas is my husband. This is what I remember. So it can't be a dream. This means I'm awake. If I'm awake, then according to them I should remember that I am Dr. Antara Vashist. I don't have a daughter and Vikas isn't my husband. I should remember all of this but honestly, I don't! Which means that's reality, and this is a dream. This is a dream. Yes, this is a dream. That means I'm still asleep. Yes, I'm sleeping. - Just calm down… - Please just wake... Are you okay? The angel in my dreams Vanished as I woke up from my sleep I searched the earth and the skies She was gone with the wind But my eyes refuse to sleep They won't rest until they see That angel from my dreams What's the matter? Why is the school closed? The transformer blew up last night due to the lightning. There's no electricity. How will the children study? She told me, that the transformer would blow up, and school will be closed for two days. And that's what happened! What are you saying, Anay? Who's the woman that appears on your TV and how did she save you? She was in my room, and I was in my room as well. She asked me to stay in or the fire brigade would crush me. And trust me, Mom, I saw the fire brigade go past! - Do you hear yourself? - Yes, Mom. Had I been to Mr. Raja's house yesterday, then I would be dead. But I am still alive because I didn't go there. She was from the future, just like The Terminator! And she works at the Blue Cross Hospital. I'm not going to let you watch English films anymore. Take this. Go and wash your hands. First, I must find out if Anay is alive or not. Did I really save him? I think I know what happened. What? Anay is alive… Which means I went into the past and changed it, which resulted in changing the present. But, how did saving Anay change my life? That's not making sense. Listen… I believe you. But others won't believe you just because I do. What you're saying sounds implausible. I'm trying to understand it myself. There was a storm and thundering last night and you could hear people fighting at Mr. Raja's house. I was going to go there and check but she warned me against it and asked me to stay in. If I went out, the fire brigade would run me over. If you mention the fire brigade once more, I will kill you. Now shut up and have your food! Vikas runs his own security agency. His wife's name is Bhavna Awasthi. They moved here two years ago. There is no record of you two getting married. There's no record of Avanti Awasthi either. Her name isn't registered in any of the schools in the entire district. And you… Are registered as Ms. Antara Vashist. You've been a surgeon at the Blue Cross Hospital for seven years. Dr. Sethupati brought you here. He's your guarantor. Listen. I want to find your daughter Avanti. But first, you've to establish that she exists. Can I meet Anay? Don't you think we should meet Dr. Sethupati first? Okay. You trust him, right? Let's go then. I went through the picnic cassette while you were asleep. There was no woman on it, son. When I was your age, even I believed all my dreams were real. Come on, have it. I even thought that my doll talked to me. Have it. The police will get suspicious if you get so anxious. I'm worried for Abhishek. If something goes wrong, they'll send him to the orphanage. - I will... - I won't let anything happen to him. You… Just do as I say. Don't come back until I say so. I'll stay here and fix everything. - Are you sure? - Hey! Relax. Okay? Take care. Hello. The storm last night broke a door. A pot broke as well. I am here to get some soil. Please continue. Carry on. Okay. And this… Do you have a plastic bag? I need one of this as well. Everything is where it has to be, fortunately. Scans are okay, vitals are good. We'll have to take some stress tests. Doctor, why would I make up stories? Look, my dear. We've known each other since I started teaching at your college. Do you trust me? Two months ago, a child named Avantika, came here from Kolhapur. It was through a reference. She had brain tumour. And I said… We cannot save her, but you insisted. You said that… You could save her. But she couldn't survive. Avantika's death deeply affected you. And you started drinking. At home, in your car and even in the hospital. Antara. What is this, my dear? Why are you doing this? Drinking keeps me out of my senses… And that keeps the guilt away. You had a similar case more than a year ago. The patient's name was Vikas Awasthi, owner of a private security firm. You saved him. How's that possible? That's your signature. I am not a fricking doctor! Hey… look my dear. Avantika's death caused you severe trauma. It's a classical repression. I told you to take a leave because of your drinking problem. I wanted you to go somewhere. But you'd come here daily and relive your failures. Sir… Sir, I'm ready. I'll perform the surgery on Mr. Ranjit. I don't think so. I haven't touched the bottle in three days. I really need to do this, sir. And yesterday night… You got drunk again. And then you took a cab home. Then how do I remember that you operated Mr. Ranjit, and his BP spiked during the procedure? It was Avantika who's BP was spiked. You… You have it all mixed up. Okay, fine. So you're all telling the truth, and I'm lying. Okay? So, tell me what I should do. How do I move on? How do I live a life I don't remember? I remember that I have a six-year-old daughter, whose name is Avanti. She's four feet tall, loves to swim. And she's scared of lightning. That's the reality for me. Your mind is trying to connect random dots. Okay, fine. Let's say I'm trying to connect the dots. I killed a child named Avantika on the operation table and that has traumatized me. And I'm trying to connect that dot to Vikas Awasthi. I am not Awasthi, I am Vashisht. I am not a nurse, I am a doctor. I'm not this, I'm that. But what do I do with the dots in my mind? They don't connect with your dots! Tell me, what should I do? - Dear. - Antara… Antara. Sorry, doctor. Wait, Antara. Stop the car! A wanderer lost in the jungle of time… A wanderer… A wanderer lost in the jungle of time… Life going around in circles In the maze of circles Everyone he comes across Seems like a stranger Life going around in circles In the maze of circles Everyone he comes across Seems like a stranger And the eyes search for The star that shows the path A wanderer lost in the jungle of time… A wanderer… In the jungle of time… Hey! Who are you? Hi, Bhavna. Who are you? Antara. Antara who? What are you doing here? Are you and Vikas together? Why do you care? Do you know Vikas? - Vikas! - What happened? Vikas! - You two live here? - Shut up. Vikas! Put that down or I'll hit you. - Put it down! - What happened? Who is she? Vikas, where is the TV? What TV? The TV with the video recorder connected to it. What TV? What video recorder? The one on which that boy appeared last night. Where is it? You remember that old TV? Dr. Antara Vashist? - What are you doing here? - You know her? She is Dr. Antara Vashist. She operated on me. - And she was in my hotel as well. - Why? She came looking for her missing daughter. - Our daughter, Vikas. - Doctor, please! Our daughter is missing. - What? Please. - What please? - I have no idea! - What does she mean by "our daughter"? I don't understand why she says that it's our daughter who's missing. Because she is our daughter! Avanti's missing and I can't find her! Doctor, do you even hear yourself? - What is she saying? - I don't know what she's talking about! She's been bothering me since morning. So tell her that she's lying. She is lying! Why would I lie? I don't know why you're lying! - But I want my daughter back! - Shut up! Bhavna, what are you doing? What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? She's not lying! I can smell her on you! I am the one who does the laundry everyday. - I can smell her on you! - Have you lost it? - You fucking asshole. - Listen to me! - Bhavna, calm down! - Since when are you guys together? - How long has this been going on? - What's wrong with you? - I'm done with this! - Nothing's going on, man! - Bhavna, I don't know who the hell she is. - Today onwards... Step by step, moment by moment It's lost in questions Step by step, moment by moment It fades in the darkness Lost in questions Faded in darkness Lost in questions Faded in darkness Away it goes… Wanders around like A lonely traveler in bane Keeps hearing the footsteps all night Wanders around like A lonely traveler in bane Keeps hearing the footsteps all night As the darkness says The dawn shall not come again… Check the CCTV in the guard house. The two of you go inside. What's the police doing outside? Someone must have complained about something. I think it's going to rain. How do you know? The wind has stopped. Anyway, are you hungry? Shall we eat? Shouldn't we wait for Abhishek? Abhishek isn't a child anymore. He can have dinner later. But he did call. There's water logging on Market Street. It's all the way up to the gates of the bookshop. He'll be late. How about some wine? Why not? I'll get it. Where's the opener? I guess Abhishek took it along with him. Check his backpack. It's near his cycle. Why would he take it? Is his love life finally blossoming? I hope that's true. Where is his cycle? We're closed! Go back home. Get back home soon! There's a storm coming. The storm is already here, Abhishek. Hey, man! Abhishek, I at least expect you to say that you know me. Please. Yes, I do! You are… - One second. - You don't know me. I actually do remember you. I just… I'm just trying to remember your name. You are… - Where did we meet? - Abhishek? Do you need a towel? I'll get you a towel. But there's a storm coming. Looking for something specific? Thank you. Didn't you want to become a pilot? If wishes were horses… I could even be Sachin Tendulkar, right? How do you know? Because your father was a pilot. Do we really know each other? Vikas is your neighbor, right? Vikas… Awashti? Yes. Oh! Now I know who you are! - Antara… - Dr. Antara Vashist? Right. Now I recognize you. You're the one who performed his brain surgery. You removed whatever brain he had left. You shouldn't have done that. - How are you? - Do you remember Anay? - Anay? - Anay… Anay? He used to live in the same house as Vikas does. Please sit. Oh God! Wait a minute. Why are you here, ma'am? How do you know Anay? Okay, fine. I'll call you later. I'll be right back, Ms. Rukmani. I introduced you to Vikas, in college? And how did we meet? We studied in the same university. Dr. Sethupati had come to our medical college to take lectures. I'll be right back. - Abhishek, right? - Yeah. Dr. Sethupati... Auntie Sheela gave him a bottle of pickle to hand it over to you. I was at your college to give it to you. After that, we met often because… I guess you used to like me. - Don't finish it. - I want some. Yes. - Wow. - Hey, come back. Thumps Up? You wanted to ask me out on a date, but you didn't have the guts. So you asked me out on a double date. There I met Vikas and Bhavna. Bhavna was your friend, who was in the photography department. And then eventually you got married to Vikas. - Yes. - Yeah. And you have a son… - Daughter. - Right, a daughter. And later you moved here to my city. And at your housewarming... You told me about Anay. How he was killed by a fire brigade. And that same night, I saw Anay on TV. I saved his life. Since then, my entire life has changed. No one recognizes me. Avanti doesn't exist for anyone. Vikas got married to Bhavna and you're selling books. How many times have you read that book? Which book? 2:12. 2:12, the book. How many times have you read it? Because whatever you're saying sounds like its sequel! You haven't read 2:12? Abhishek, I'm telling the truth. It really happened. That's what Anay used to say as well. "I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying. Believe me." He used to conjure several stories. He used to say that his TV is a portal. You know, like a gateway, which opens at 2:12 a.m. And a woman comes on it who tells her stories. Why is the time 2:12? It's because it was the time when he didn't get killed by the fire brigade. The moment that he didn't die it was 2:12 a.m. on his watch. I swear I'm not making this up. Same! These are the exact words Anay used. Do you know Raja Uncle? I'm sure you do. Raja Uncle's wife left him. This idiot told the police that Raja Uncle killed his wife. When the police questioned him, he said that the woman on his TV told him that. So, the police asked him to show it to them. They asked him to show where she was. He said she's gone now. It's because the portal closed at 2:12. Only Anay can tell us, whether the portal opened or closed at 2:12. Or Dr. Strange. Or I'm sure Christopher Nolan knows about it. Is Anay alive? At least he didn't die in front of me. Who wrote this book? Who is Sonia Matthews? She is his therapist! His therapist wrote this book. This book is very popular in Hinjewadi. A lot of people are here to read it and it sells a lot. Paulo Coelho is collecting dust, while this has become a bestseller here. Where can I find Anay? He left the city, ma'am, since he became a laughing stock. A woman on the TV, murder at the neighbors, a Terminator style savior. He used to talk nonsense all day. He had completely lost his plot. He used to sit in front of the TV and just keep staring. He used to wait for his lady Arnold Schwarzenegger to return. But no one ever came. So auntie sold the house and left with him. And no one knows where he is since then. We're closed. What's going on? Why do people want to buy... - Sir, we're closed. - Hi. I'm here for her. Thank you. This is proof that I was telling the truth. Eat something first. You haven't eaten since morning. So basically… Anay is alive in this world, and Avanti in the other. In this world, I'm not married, and in the other, I've a daughter. You must have a life in this world as well. The house you woke up in must belong to someone. Someone who… - Is... - Everyone laughed at Anay whenever he told them about me. No one believed him when he said that Raja Ghosh killed his wife. - So? - So… In my world, Raja Ghosh was caught… And he confessed his crime in court. He even admitted where he was going to bury his wife's body. In this world, Anay is alive. Raja Ghosh hasn't been arrested. This means, he hid the body exactly where he claimed he would. - So we should look for it! - What good will that do? It will prove that Anay is telling the truth! And maybe he'll come forward. He knows what I'm talking about, so maybe he can help me get back to my world. I've been calling you for so long. What are you doing? What are you looking at? The books says that Anay always felt, that the portal opened from the future to the past. This means, opening the portal wasn't under his control. So, Anay would switch on the TV during every storm. And they are talking about a storm on the radio, which is similar to the one in 1996. Yes, it's possible. This means, the portal is still open. What if the portal actually closes on 2:12? Anay. Someone's here to see you. Come on. Hello. That's Ms. Sonia. She's a friend. She's here to talk to you. Hello. Hello, dear. Come on in. Would you like to sit with me? - I'll be outside if you need anything. - Sure. Good evening. Hello. Do you need something? Anay was saying that he saw some people arguing at your house yesterday. Is everything alright? Did he see anyone? It's because I wasn't home. The backdoor was open when I arrived and Rujuta's diamond ring is missing. I see. I bought mutton. It's getting cooked. I can't figure it out, Sheela. Anay either sits in front of the TV… Or else… He'll keep staring at Raja Ghosh's home. Anay claims that he saw some people fighting in there and that Raja Ghosh killed Rujuta. What? Do you even hear yourself? Someone murdered a woman in your neighborhood and you have no clue about it. - No! - Hey. Something is wrong. And Raja Ghosh is a weird man. I saw him cleaning his car. And he shut the boot as soon as I arrived. And yesterday… I saw him load huge garbage bags in his car. Something isn't right. I think I should go to the police. Have you lost your mind? Do you know that it is a crime to accuse someone? And if you can't prove it, then living here will become difficult. Who is on duty? The factory runs 24-hours. What is a spray pond? Where is it? - Spray pond? - Yeah. It's behind the factory. That's the spray pond, which regulates the temperature of the water. He admitted at the court that he was going to hide the body next to the spray pond. That's what was written in the article. Okay, I get that… But where exactly has he hidden it? Sir, you must come to the police station with us, for some routine questioning. Come on. The case has been reopened. We'll call Raja Ghosh for questioning. Forensics must prove that the body belongs to Raja Ghosh's wife. Then we'll announce it over the news. After that maybe we can find Anay. - But the portal is only open for tonight. - How do you know? I must find Anay before the portal closes. Someone might know where Anay and his mom moved to? What if you do find Anay? How can he help you find Avanti? That was his TV. I don't know how I got stuck in his story. I think I know who will know about this. Who? Vikas. He bought the house. He must have transferred the money to someone. Or maybe his lawyer, or CA, or real estate agent, might know. What day is it today? Friday. Vikas doesn't come home on Fridays. I know where he is. I've to head to the police station. Sheela and Raja have been called in for questioning. I'll see you there. You go find Anay. Let me know if you find him. Thank you. Hello. Sara! Sara! Sara. Do you know what the time is? - Do you know what I just got out of? - What? That doctor came all the way home. Bhavna kept yelling at me the entire night. She thinks I'm having an affair with the doctor. But that's great. Bhavna will break your heart… - And I will mend it. - Really? I called off housekeeping. Must be on their routine checks. But the room was supposed to be unoccupied for tonight. I'll check. - Go check. - Yeah, I'll just check. - Who is it? - Ma'am, I just wanted to check the room. There are some guests downstairs who don't have a prior booking, so I wanted to check if the room is empty. Who is on duty? Ma'am, I received a call on the service phone. I'll inform them that the room isn't unoccupied. What is your name? I'll inform them that the room isn't unoccupied. No, wait a minute. Excuse me. Hello. I knew it. Excuse me, you can't just barge in like this. Like, what? Like you barged in his marriage. Like that? Doctor, what do you want? You think I don't know about your Friday inventories? That's a personal matter. You've seen for yourself… What my position is in my own house. I found a key card and a lighter in your pocket. The lighter had her initials on it. You have your initials on the lighter and on the water bottle? You should check if she put her initials on your back as well. Why are you harassing me, doctor? What do you want? I don't know! I don't know! Who is Avanti? I want Anay's address. Anay? Yes. Who is Anay? Anay? The guy whose house you live in. The same Anay that you brought the place from two years ago. I haven't met the guy… Who sold me that house… Two years ago. He transferred the power of attorney to a lady. You must have transferred the money to someone. I even transferred the money to your hospital after the operation, ma'am. Which account did you transfer the money to? There must be some kind of address on the deed. I signed the sales deed with that lady, and I transferred the money into her account. Give me the lady's address. Now? Why? Do you want to have another round? Fine, I'll wait outside. - What the hell! - He won't last too long anyway. Ma'am, sir has called you inside. Come on. Sir… We only found one file in the archives. Thank you. Saraswati Sugar Factory. We found these remains. This skeleton belongs to your first wife Rujuta. She left you, right? How do you know it belongs to her? It's not too difficult to find out. The body was chopped up, stuffed in four plastic bags, and buried near the spray pond. We had a witness… Around 25-years-ago. He said the same thing. No one believed him. If your claim turns out to be a lie, then you'll be facing a long jail term. Have you ever been to jail? Do you know the kind of people that come there? Please don't scare him. Why would he lie? He never lies. And anyway, children never lie. Children are the biggest liars, ma'am. Why don't you check his house? He said the storm broke his backdoor. Then it broke a pot. He was digging up his garden to fill the pot. I didn't ask him anything. And when I asked he said his house was burgled. Someone barged into his house. He was cooking mutton. He's the one lying! What do you want to imply? Is it a crime to cook mutton or fix the pot? - I'm not talking to you. - Listen to me, ma'am. We checked his house. We've done our investigation. And you're not allowed to sit next to him. So you shouldn't speak in the first place. I've seen him put plastic bags in his luggage boot. - Ask him. - Did you see what was in the bag? There was blood on the floor. He was cleaning it. Ma'am, not all blood is human blood. Then why was he cleaning it so secretly? Ask him. Listen to me carefully. I am being polite because he's just a child. Otherwise, I would've dragged him inside the lockup. You're lucky to have a neighbor like him. He didn't file a single complaint against you, and you're still accusing him. We also know that the next day Rujuta went missing, you used Rujuta's ticket to fly out of here, Sheela Auntie. I need a lawyer. Listen, Raja Ghosh… You think you're in America. You're not going anywhere. You're going to rot in here. First in police custody and then in the judicial custody. People get arrested without a reason. In your case, we found a skeleton. He hasn't done anything. Sheela. He did everything to save me. - Sheela. - Let me speak. It wasn't intentional. It happened by accident. We've been hiding this since years. Careful. - Hi, Abhishek. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine, how are you? Hope your studies are going well. - Hello. - Where are you coming from? I was just getting some groceries for the house. I see. Hi, Rujuta. - See you. - Okay. After my husband passed away, Raja would often help me a lot. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Can I help? - No, it's okay. - You want some tea? - Feel free to ask if you need anything. - Tea? - No, I'll be late. Raja was not happy with Rujuta… And I wasn't happy alone. But together we were… Sheela was always quieter, kinder, as compared to Rujuta. Rujuta never trusted me. We had no children, and that's why she always thought that I would leave her. She pushed me towards Sheela. And being around Sheela made me feel good. Hello, sir. Sir has arrived. - Is she very angry? - No, she's normal. Yes, tell me. I'll be visiting my mom for a couple of days. When? I am leaving by afternoon's flight. Call me when you land. Can you stay alone? I wanted to tell Rujuta… But… She would yell and scream, throw objects at me even if she was speculating. She had harmed herself a couple of times. I can only imagine what she would've done if I'd told her. - I knew this was going on. - Listen. Rujuta, please listen. Rujuta, don't do this. No, please. - Leave me. - Listen to me, please. Raja! Rujuta. Rujuta, listen to me. - Listen to me, please. - Leave me. - Rujuta, stop! - You were my friend. Mom. - Rujuta, please hear me out. - Mom. What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Rujuta. Please stop both of you. Rujuta. Leave me. I will kill her. Leave it. Let go of me! - Leave me. - Don't be stupid. Stop! I was holding the knife, but she fell on her own. Whatever happened that night… Was all an accident. My only fear was that if anything happens to me, then what would happen to Abhishek? I had no other option. And you punished that boy for your mistake. You proved him a liar and made a joke out of him. I was left with no other option. He had seen you… When you were chopping your wife's body. I had no other option. When a dead body is lying in your home in a civilized colony, how will you smuggle it out? Helplessness makes you a monster. For a man… Who can mutilate his wife's body, lying isn't a difficult task. And Anay made my job easier. He said some woman from the future told him, what was happening in his neighbor's house. It was easy for you, sir. But not for him. He was sent to counselors and psychiatrists. - Child… - No one listened to him. Are you sure you were not dreaming? Or maybe you were mixing up events in your life? I saw her! Neither doctors nor the police. Her mother kept fighting for him. Hey… 2:12! He had become a joke. Even his friends stopped talking to him. He used to sit in front of the TV, hoping that the woman would show up again. Hello. Are you there? Antara. He and his mother got so isolated… That they left the city. Anay had one hope. Anay knew that the woman on TV… Would come to Blue Cross Hospital someday. So, he waited outside every month. And one day she arrived. Finally… I met the woman that appeared on my TV. I met her in the future, many years later. And she's the one who told me today… Where your first wife's body is buried. You? You know… We consider the saviors as God. But even God has some decorum! You've screwed me over today. You might as well have killed me on the operation table! I was unconscious anyway. Top floor. Her name is Shikha Vats. And I hope we'll never meet again! Now, do you remember? Come. Come in. Come in. This is your home, dear. Your life's here with Anay. You two have been together for five years. An and… There's a tattoo on your arm of his name. Anay An and. He's waiting for you. There was no one in the paths of time Who knew your whereabouts With every passing moment, This distance increases Now tell me where you are But I won't find peace or calm Until she holds me in her arms That angel from my dreams That angel from my dreams You knew everything. - You already knew, right? - No. I didn't know. All I knew was when I was a kid I saw a woman appear on my TV. And that was you. I genuinely don't know who Avanti is or where she is. You are my reality. Avanti doesn't exist. Anay exists, doesn't he? Couldn't you tell me that you're Anay? Would you have believed me? You forgot me in a single night. For you, Anay is still a 13-year-old kid. You're my life. You love me. I love you. We love each other. You love me. You actually don't remember? The life you've been living for a day… I endured it for 20 years. Everyone used to call me crazy. I used to sit in front of the TV every day. Waiting for you to show up. I couldn't forget your face. It was etched on my mind. I only knew your name… And Blue Cross Hospital. Good morning, Dr. Vashist. I saw Blue Cross hospital being built from scratch. I saw every brick that was laid. I used to wait outside, only to meet you. I wanted to see you again. Talk to you. Ask questions. I was not a liar. I went there everyday. I waited for you everyday. I wanted to meet Antara. The same Antara who appeared on my TV. The Antara who saved my life. I decided that I won't let you go, until you don't answer all my questions. I got to know you. We met every day. And as we kept meeting those questions felt pretty small. I forgot all about that night after meeting you. Good for you, Anay. Good for you. Why are you doing this? You survived. You got your Antara. What about Avanti? Who will save her? - Her father is going to leave her. - How do you know? How do you know Avanti is alone? And that she doesn't have an Antara? Because I am here. You don't get it. Just like you're here, I'm here… Even she must have an Antara? - Possible. - Not possible. Because according to me, there's only one Antara, who should be with Avanti, and she isn't! I don't understand this parallel universe. I want to go back to Avanti, no matter what universe she's in. This is our world. You and me. - We have a world together here. - No, we don't! We don't! This is your world! Then go back to your world. I won't stop you. How will you go back? - The same way I came here. - How did you get here? Don't you know how I got here, Anay? You found me, right? You saved me first… And that's why I could find you. Fine. So now it's your turn. You will save me and I will find you. Anay, don't worry. If not the police. Then someone else will help us. Anay! Anay. Anay. What's the matter? - What are you doing? - Get aside, Mom. What's the matter? Where is Antara? Where is Antara? Anay… Mom! Anay, I am Anay. Who are you? Just like you… I am Anay as well. Can you hear me, Anay? Anay! Can you hear me, Anay? Mom, that's Anay. I am Anay as well. Twenty five years in the future. This is 2021. This is me and... Come here. And this is you. This is you in 2021. Mom, we're running out of time. Anay, listen to me. That woman Antara you saw on TV, will never come back. She will never come back again. If you want to meet her then don't wait for her. Don't chase after her. Got it? Class over, session over! Come on children, get in a line. Mom! Mom, why are you crying? It's nothing. Sometimes I'm scared as well. Mom, will the storm come back? I hope not. When did you arrive? Sorry, I was just a little tensed, so… I'll just… It's okay, Vikas. I only stopped you because you said you wanted to quit. Otherwise, I really don't care what you do in your life. I've quit drinking. So there's no whiskey bottle on your hotel desk? Come on, Antara. It must belong to a guest. I'll check. For Sara. Sara? Do you love her? Here's your honeymoon suite key. I wanted to talk to you. Since when? What do you mean? Since when did you want to tell me? We moved here for her… not for us. It's not what you think. You've no idea what I'm thinking. We haven't unpacked yet. I can leave with Avanti. Actually… You wouldn't have expected that I'd leave so easily. In fact, why should I leave? Sara has a house. You've a hotel suite. In fact, you two have the entire hotel to yourself. You may leave. Why do you want to make our child homeless? I tried, Antara, but… I can't do it. I don't feel anything for you. Maybe… Maybe we're not meant to be. Perhaps in some other world. Trust me, Vikas, there's no world out there, where you're happy with your wife. Trust me. Mom, what's wrong with you? Nothing. Let's unpack. He's called Fluffy. And he's… Catty! And what's inside this? These are Avanti's clothes - which she will arrange herself, right? - Sheela! - Good girl. - Let's have tea outside today. It's nice weather. And don't leave without meeting us, Abhishek. Auntie! Raja Ghosh is alive. And Sheela is with him. This means, the world I returned to… Has Rujuta… Mom, where are we going? We're going… To meet someone. Boss's car is here. Move. - Jai Hind, sir. - Sir, whose body is it? Sir, listen. - Where is it? - Behind the factory. - I want to go see Mom as well. - We will, dear. Where is the lady who called us? There she is. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm DCP Anay An and. I know. How do you know? Antara. Antara Vashist.
