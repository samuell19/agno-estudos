You should see him with his son. He is such a good dad. - Aw. - He sounds like a great guy. - Let's talk about you. - How's school? It's okay. I'm worried about my students, though. I mean, I talk to my friends who work at private schools, and they just seem to have so many more resources than we do. I'm sorry, Jackie. I wish I still had my money. I'd give some of it to your kids. Thanks, Kim. We'll figure something out. - That was a lovely dinner. - Thank you. Pleasure. I'm sorry. I'm not good at this.

Otherwise, it'll be pretty lonely. [chuckles] Is that funny? No, no. I'm sorry. You just... sound like my son. Well, I'll take that as a compliment. You should. So are we going to try this again? I would like to. You're a really nice person, you know, and I... Believe or not, I enjoyed this. And it proved that maybe I am ready for a relationship again. So thank you for that. Wow. That was the nicest brush-off I've ever gotten. That was a brush-off, right? I'm... I'm sorry. She's a lucky girl, whoever she is. But if you ever decide to date anyone else, I call dibs, okay? [laughs] I'm not really sure how to answer that. Thank you? [both chuckle] Come on, let's get you home. [car alarm beeps] Thanks. You need to save me from vegetables. That's all Dee wanted to feed me tonight. I'll take any pizza with meat on it. Yeah. He's had a traumatic vegetable experience. Okay. One all-meat pizza coming up. Yes! How was your night? Have you had a break yet tonight? Chester, can I take a break? Can I have some money for some video game tokens later? David. Please? Yeah, sure. - One-time deal, okay? - Wait a sec. I'll be right back. Don't blow this. - What? - Her, this. She's great. Ask her on a real date. David, she still works for me. If you can't change the rule, then... fire her and date her and hire her back. When did you get to be so smart? I think it's the Internet. - Here are some tokens. - [coins rattle] - Whoa! - Thanks, Kimberly. Yeah. That was nice. You want to get some air? Michael, I'm so sorry. Claire was a champ. But I think it's time for a change. Don't you? What do you mean? I've been struggling with my own rules... Dating employees. Wait. I'm the first girl you've wanted to date in three years?

Does that solve your problem? Um... yeah. So... when's our first date? So did you fire her? She quit on her own. That's great. If I have to stay at Dee's, will you let me bring my own dinner? [laughs] Deal. Yes. Come on. I'm proud of you. Well, it's easier to find another job than it is to find a good man. He told me about his blind date and his life. He was open and honest. I've never met a man like that. I'm happy for you. I'm happy for him. I'm happy for me. I get to keep you full-time. With a raise. A raise? Yeah. Well, otherwise I take a pay cut working here. Are you forgetting about the tips? Okay. A raise. Thank you. Thank you. - So this thing with Michael... - That was unexpected. - It just happened. - It wasn't forced or planned. You know, I'm starting to wish you lost your money a long time ago. Why would you wish that? Because now I have my Kimmy back. I hate to admit it, but you're right. I was horrible... Entertaining, but horrible. How could you still be my friend? Because... I love who I know you are deep down inside. Need some help? - Nope. - I'm pretty much done. Your little girl did all the work before she went home. You know, I can't believe she quit her job at the sporting goods store to date her boss. You never did anything for love? Not in a long, long time. It's not too late, is it? After seeing the changes in Kimberly, anything's possible. Very true. Yes, anything is possible. That lightens my heart. Kimberly comes to work full-time, and her mother gets to visit more often. [laughing] Thank you for a wonderful evening. It's my pleasure. It's not often I get to spend time with a beautiful woman. [giggles] Stop it. I worry about you and Kimberly. I want to help. I want to give you money. Oh, no. No, no. I wouldn't... I wouldn't dream of it. - I don't mean to offend you. - I... Chester... I think that is the sweetest offer anyone has ever made me, but I... I can't take your money. I had a really good time. - Hey, James. - Hey. Nice to see you. Hey, I was just here to check on your mother. Really? Don't you see her all the time? She works for you. Oh, yes, of course she does. But it's a big firm. It's busy, and I don't get to see her much at all, and I like to look in on my real-estate investments once in a while. - Mm. - She's inside. So how are you doing? I couldn't be better. Thank you so much for your generosity. Oh... No, really, the apartment, Mother's job... You really stepped up in our hour of need, and for that, I just... I want you to know I really appreciate it. There isn't much I wouldn't do for your family. You know that. If I ever get the chance to pay you back, I will. That's a promise. - I'm off to work. - [laughs] Okay. - I'll see you later. - All right. Huh. Okay. You win. I don't know who that was out there, but it sure looked like Kimberly. Didn't act like her. It's wonderful, isn't it? So maybe you've gotten what you wanted. Maybe it's time to end this and get back into your home. I'm kind of enjoying it here with Kimberly. Think we can stay just a little bit longer? Well, you own this building, so you don't have to ask me. I do think you should stop now. Get back to real life. - Mm. - I'm afraid to. Why? Are you afraid she'll revert back? - No, no, no, that's... - That's the least of my worries. I'm concerned about the other person that I like too. [both laughing] Every time. I can't remember the last time I laughed like this. This picnic was a good idea. Well, I had ulterior motives. Oh? It's time to see how you are at batting. You're gonna trust me with a bat? Yeah. Next logical step in our relationship, I think. [giggles] So you've never done this before? No. I'm kind of nervous. - Okay. You're gonna be great. - Okay. You're good with throwing the ball. - Yeah. That was all right. - Are you left- or right-handed? - Right-handed. - You're right-handed. Yeah. On the other side. [both chuckling] Wait. Switch your hands. Yeah, that's it. Right one down there. Down, closer. And you want to hit anything that's right here, so keep your weight balanced on both feet, and anything that's right here, you swing for it. - Okay. - Okay. All right. Well, we'll go easy on you. - You ready? - I'm ready. You think this is funny? - Just a little bit. - [laughs] I'm not as athletic as you. Sorry. Here. - Pitch it again. - Okay. You ready? - Whoo-hoo! - Whoa! - Score! - I made a point. You got a point. Okay. Let's try that again. See if this is not beginner's luck. Okay. Ooh! - You're a pro. - More, more, more, more! I had such a great time. I got a lot of points. [laughs] You sure did. Oh, Chester said that I can take tomorrow afternoon off to watch David's last game. That's great, but I hope it's not his last game. We win tomorrow, we make it to the playoffs. - I'm gonna hope you win. - I'll be there, cheering. [giggles] Hey, thank you for today, for everything. I'm very grateful Kimberly walked into my fine-dining establishment. If I didn't spot her potential, I wouldn't have met you. You're wonderful women. Thank you. You know, you wouldn't have recognized Kimberly before she started working here. - She's a good kid. - You should be proud. I am very proud of her. But, um... Oh, Chester. I'm not so proud of myself. I did something. I... I lied... To her and to you. - Jackie, I had the best date. - You were right. Losing the money was absolutely the best thing that could've ever happened to me. Wow, I have never heard you sound so happy. I am. I really am. I wish I could chat, but I'm meeting Martin for dinner, and I'm already late. - Yeah, yeah. Go. - Oh, and can you tell him that I am beginning to fall in love with my new little car? Bye. - You never lost the money? - That wasn't true? No. I-I made it up, and I feel terrible about deceiving you, especially since you were so sweet, wanting to loan me money. I'm sorry. I know what you were trying to do. - That I understand. - Do you? Sure I do. Things like that that are done from love, they deserve special forgiveness. Really? But don't do it again. I promise. You know, you should tell her now. I know you had her best interests at heart, - and it kind of worked. - Kind of? She's a different person. Well, I never knew her before, but maybe you should tell her for you. I mean, if somebody did that to me, I'd want to get back at them. That's what I'm afraid of. You want me to go with you? No. No, I-I have to do this myself. Got it. There is something I wanted to ask you way before I knew you were loaded. Ask me what? For a date. What took you so long? [sighs] We'll talk later. Kimberly, we need to talk. I'm off to work and then David's baseball game. Uh, let's talk tonight. Love you. Love you. [door closes] [sighs] [crowd applauds] Come on, Curtis. All right, come on, buddy. Come on, buddy. [bat pings] Yeah! - Oh, yeah! - Go, David! - I got it! - [overlapping shouting] Good work, guys. - Come on, let's go. - We're going to the playoffs! You guys did great today. We won. We won. - I know! - It was such a good game. I'm so excited for you and your dad. Hey, Garrett. Nice game. That was a really nice thing to do. He was probably feeling a bit sad, and you would've made him feel a little better. He's not sad. He's one of the luckiest guys I know. - How's that? - They lost. He gets to go to the Arizona Pro Baseball Camp this summer. Is that a big deal? Only everything, everything. Dad says it's way too expensive. I'm sorry you can't go. It's the best baseball camp in the world. - Hey, you two. - You think we should celebrate? I do. I think I could even get a discount on the pizza. And a cup of tokens? With a team that's going to the playoffs, absolutely. [laughs] Jackie, you should have been there. David made the last out, and now his team is going to the playoffs. Oh, that's amazing. And you should've seen how nice David was to the losing team. - He is such a good kid. - Okay. I got to say, I have never seen you this enthusiastic about sports or kids before. You know, his team's equipment is, like, 15 years old? I wish I could afford to buy the team all-new equipment before the playoffs. David doesn't need you to buy him things. He just needs you to be there for him. Besides, a lack of resources builds character, right? At least that's what I tell my students. Yeah, you're right. [chuckles] Kimberly. - [sighs] Mother. - You scared me. What are you doing, sitting here in the dark? Waiting for you. Michael's team won the game. They're in the playoffs. It was so great to be a part of. Oh, that's wonderful. I look at you and see what I always knew you could be. What? You've changed so much, and I'm very proud of you. So I want to tell you that what I did... I did for love. What did you do? [light music] [sighs] ♪ [exhales deeply] Are you feeling any better? Oh, Kimberly, I... I'm so sorry. But I-I really believe what I did was for the best. Can you ever forgive me? Forgive you? Mother, I want to thank you. If you hadn't have done this, I never would've learned how people live. Most importantly, I never would've met Michael. That's true. I never would've met Chester. Is there something going on there? You really want to know? No, not really. I've had James put all of your money back into your accounts and order you new credit cards. You are a rich woman again. I was rich before he put the money back. But... I know exactly what I want to do with it. It really is the top of the line. So, whenever you're ready, I got plenty in stock. Okay. Thanks. Guess who. Exactly who I wanted it to be. I'd hug you, but it's work. You're not an employee. Listen, I have to run. I got to meet a ski-equipment distributor, but we're still on for tonight, right? - Yeah. - That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. I want to take you to dinner. 8:00 p.m., Donner's... My treat. - Your treat? - Donner's? Please? - You know what? - Okay. I don't know about the whole "your treat" part, but for you, I wouldn't miss it. But now I got to go. So I'll see you tonight. Yes. - Dee? - Hey. I need your help with something. Okay. I want to get this for Michael's baseball team. Uh, I'm confused. This is thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise. You want to buy this? Yeah, for the playoffs. And if there's anything that I've left off the list, just add it. Honey, how are you gonna pay for this? - I can write a check. - I can use a credit card. If you want, I can go get cash. You're serious? I have never been more serious in my life. Okay. [soft music] ♪ [indistinct chatter] What's all this? Just getting an order ready for delivery. This is all one order? Yeah. I got it. How could I not know about this? Can I see the invoice? I got it. Dee, may I see it? Kimberly wanted to keep it a secret. [indistinct chatter] Hey. I was hoping you'd be working tonight. You know what? I-I don't even know your name. It's Brad. Brad. Brad, I owe you so many apologies. I treated you so badly and said so many awful things to you. Please, forgive me. I know I acted like a complete monster, but this is really important for me. Wow. - You're not kidding. - No, I'm not. Then... I forgive you. You have no idea how nice that is to hear. - Can I get you anything... - A glass of wine? On the house. I would like that. Hi. What's wrong? Are you okay? Can you... can you explain this to me? This was supposed to be a surprise. Well, it certainly is. - Sit down, please. - I will explain everything. I know what you're thinking, but I can afford it, okay? I'm rich again. - Again? - Wait. You see, I used to have a lot of money... a lot. And then it was gone. My mother... she said that we lost it, but that was a lie, which is actually okay, because I never would have met you if she hadn't have done it. Now I have my money back. - I don't understand. - Of course you don't. This all happened before I met you. See, I got the job at your store because I thought that I had lost all my money. Now that it's back, I don't want it for me. I want to use it to help others... Your sports team, to help David. - David? - Yes. The Arizona Pro Baseball Camp. I want to pay for it. He can go now. You did this without asking me. I told David that we couldn't afford to go this year. It's a gift. Well, what does that teach him about the value of things, about how if we want something bad enough, we have to earn it or work for it? Look, I just wanted to give him what he dreamed about. Look, I... I don't know what your story is or even who you really are, but it sounds too complicated for me. No, Michael, it's the truth. I can't. Michael. [crying] The money has ruined everything. I don't want it anymore. - You can keep it. - No, you don't mean that. You can't make that decision when you're this upset. I just want things to go back to the way they were. Okay, listen, you'll never guess what I heard. Uh, Amy's dad got a face-lift? - No. - Oh. Um... Oh, Richard likes to play golf on a public course? - No. - Oh. It turns out that Kim never lost her money. It was all some elaborate scheme by her mom to make her more down-to-earth or something stupid like that. Oh, my gosh. I'd die. I would die. That's, like, child abuse. I know, right? We should call her. [sighs] The best way to get over a man is to buy a new outfit. Or six. And now that you have your money back, you can buy as many outfits as you need until you are happy again. Anyway, how did you guys find out that I got my money back? I haven't heard from either of you in weeks. Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry about that. I was traveling, and then I had this benefit thingy, and I've just been, like, really busy. You know, you got to look at this as a blessing in disguise. Now you're free to date whoever you want now that you're rich again. Jonathan. We have to set her up with Jonathan. - Oh, my God. - You'd love Jonathan. No. I am definitely not ready to start dating again. Nonsense.

I'll fix it. Thanks, Chester. Thanks. You okay? Oh, Dee, honestly, I don't know. - I'm a bit of a mess right now. - Kimberly? Did you know that she was rich? Well, not before she bought the equipment. - I mean, did she win the lottery? - No, no. She fed me some story about how she used to be rich, and then she lost it all and then became rich again. - Good for her. - Well, it's ridiculous. Why is it ridiculous? I'm sure it's happened before. I've read about it. Yeah. But not from one day to the next. Does she make you happy? Do you like her? Does her having money make any difference? I have nothing in common with her.

She became a person that you wouldn't even want to know, and I had to do something about it. She doesn't even want the money. - She doesn't? - No. She said she was happier without it. She was happiest with you. But you're gone, and I'm here to try to fix it. I don't even know what to say. You two are crazy about each other. That's all that matters.

Which was just in time, because he couldn't stop thinking about you, anyway. He said all of that? Word for word. Did he say anything else? He said he's fallen in love with you. Can you get my chair?
