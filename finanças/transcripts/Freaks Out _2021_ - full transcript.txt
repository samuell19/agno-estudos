Welcome, ladies and gentlemen My name is Israel and I will take you to a fantastic world populated by bizarre and mythological characters. Back from successes across Europe you will meet extraordinary creatures, capable of memorable feats. Because only at the Circo Mezza Piotta imagination becomes reality. And nothing... it's as it seems. Hello! Hello! Ah! Uh! 44,457 42,499 Mother! Mother! 00,790 My lord... My lord, it's your turn. They are waiting for you. Half of Rome has come to hear it. I was in the future. He has to stop with the ether. I'll stop after I find them. They have extraordinary powers. - It will be my present to the Führer. - 00:11:41,790 Herr Franz... And pants. Irina, do you understand that this is the only chance to win? War has no winners, but only defeated. Where are they hiding, Irina? Where are they hiding? Ah! Rome! - What the fuck are you talking about? - You don't say "fuck". New York, America. We're leaving. - And U.S? - You come with me. In Sicily we sell the cart and we embark. What would it be like, we sell the cart? And the circus? And the circus, eeeh... - I do not know. - What the fuck are you saying? We just need the documents. For 300 lire each they make them better than the originals. - Three hundred lire? - 00:15:36,040 I fuck the best whores in Rome for a year. - I'll line them up. - But when ever! Let's decide quickly. Tomorrow they are waiting for me in via Caetani. - With the 300 lire. - 00:15:49,499 Just to understand. Arrived in America, without a circus, what are we doing? The "freaks" and that's it. Fu, I'm tired. How long can I go on? - The public loves us. - But if they are all dead! Not even the marquee is left there. But the war is about to end. Badoglio signed the armistice. - The worst comes now. - The king has... But who, "Sciaboletta"? He ran away like a rabbit. That's exactly what you ask us to do. Why are we responsible for an entire country? Let's join the German circus! It's always full, they say Franz is smart. Yes, the Nazi with six fingers. He is a crazy drug addict. What would I do there? A Jew at the German circus. - Is this a joke? - So what about me? Israel! Did you look at me? Where I go? In America they don't even make me wash the dishes. You can be a shepherd dog, with all the sheep there are. Shut up, dirty as you are they won't let you off the ship. - What the fuck are you laughing at? - How ugly you are. Greta Garbo spoke. It's easy for you: You are normal. And also for you. Thing? I cannot touch you. For us it is different. Without a circus we are nothing. - It's not true. - Yes, fuck it! Without a circus, we're just a gang of monsters. Quiet, Fu. In New York, I do the dishes myself. 54,665 Hey. 32,457 Matilde, what's going on? Aaaah! Israel... It's nothing. How many times do I have to tell you that you mustn't touch me? - But that's nothing. - It's dangerous. - It's nothing. You don't have to touch me! 00:19:55,457 Matilda! Come here. You didn't do anything to me. Did you understand? You are special, little girl. You must be proud. Special to do what? To turn on the light bulbs? Eh? You have a gift. But I don't want it. I hate it. My God. Fulvio is wrong: The only monster is me. I don't want to hear this story anymore. You have to make peace with the past. - Why not? - Why not. I know how it will turn out once we get to America. As? -Everyone leaves on his behalf. And how can I do without you? I will not leave you... You are the most beautiful burden that has ever happened to me. - So we don't separate? - Nobody separates us. Not even the war. - But now let's go inside, my ass is frozen. - Away. - Aren't you sleepy? - Then it's better if we sleep. America. America. America. Here. Once we arrive, we put the circus back on its feet. See you tonight. Be careful. Ah! Shalom. There is a pig, I swear to you. Fulvio! A pig! There he is! Oooh! Your Mortacci! ♪ Black pork ♪ with flour, ♪ with beans and pecorina ricotta ♪ Maybe he stopped for supplies. ♪ That caciotta that I like ♪ with a quarter or half a liter when there is ♪ - What if they arrested him? - But which "arrested". 'This piece of shit screwed us and left alone. - I gave him 300 lire. - And I don't? - Three hundred lire. - What do you think? Accursed Jew, he fooled us with a smirk. Don't talk about Israel like that. - He promised me. - You will understand! He is like a father to us. - Go trust the fathers. - Mine always beat me. Mine locked me up in a cage for ten years. At least there were the books. Mine left me in front of a church under a beehive. The pinches... I was all a bubble. And who saved you without expecting anything? Huh? She saved you Israel. If it wasn't for him, who knows where we would be. - Who knows where he is now. - With my 300 lire! Enough! It seems that you are talking about a brigand! Worse. Israel is a good person and loves us. It is the drama of war: Turns the best men into the worst. Let's make sure it doesn't happen to us. Let's go find it, all together. If we don't find it we go to the Zirkus Berlin, at Franz's. Mmmh! He's not the strongest, but this son of a bitch... is one of the four. I tell you. Do you see the gills? Can breathe underwater. I'm sure it's him. He has superpowers. - He's drowning. - It's impossible! Yesterday he lasted for twenty minutes. Breathe! Breathe! Breathe. Breathe! Breathe, please. Hey! Breathe! Breathe! Hey! Breathe! Hey! Breathe! Ah! Amon, ehi, Amon. Ehi! Amon! - I swear, he made it yesterday. - She's over. You go back to Berlin. Give me another month. I'm almost there. You've been looking for them for three years, - I can't cover you anymore. - This time it's different. It is embarrassing. The fort is used to relocate soldiers. What good is it to you if you lose the war. I am our only hope. They are our only hope. The ether has burned your brain. Germany will be razed to the ground. There will be a trial in Nuremberg, you will be sentenced! I see the future, Amon! Me too. And I tell you, yours is 1500 kilometers from here. You go home. I organized concerts for you. Fuck the music. I want to be on the front line with you. Take care of yourself, my brother. - Hitler will kill himself. - You're crazy, he lowers his voice. He'll shoot himself in the head. Farewell, Franz. - Do it for our mother. - Stop that! Amon. Please, you can't do this to me. I beg you. Keep a shred of dignity. - You are a German! - But you are my brother, you can not do this to me. You can not do this to me. I'll give you an exact week, until the big show. After that, if you don't find them, you close the shack and puppets and you go. I got it? Yup. And play something new. Kesselring gives me the torment, he wants to come and hear you. Yup. - How it is reduced. He falls apart. - Here we go. - Oh, shut up. - What is it, a party? Come on, come on, come on. On the truck, come on! Forward! 10,249 < On the truck, come on! Forward! Leave them! What's going on, Fu? FULVIO: They rake. - That is? - They take the Jews away. All lined up. Come on! You are ready? Hey! Shall we load? - 00,957 Hey! Fuck. Another wasted bullet. Let's go. - Halt! - Anna! 24,832 - Who are you? - Street performers. - Buskers! - Yup. You just look like a flea dog to me. - Did you see it? - But look at it! - Why are you laughing? - Shut up. - Because it looks like a dog. - Look at that stuff. - Have you seen? - Let us go. - No, no, no, little dog! But look at it... Aaah! - Do it again and I'll kill you. - Halt! - Halt or I'll shoot! - Are you hurt? 02,374 - I told you to move. - Force! Walk! - Go, Fu. - Forward! Hurry up, get in line. - Halt! - Get in line or I'll shoot. Cencio! Fulvio! He is mine, I am not Jewish, he is my son. - What is it? - He is my son. - What? - He is my son! I am not Jewish! - She is not Jewish and this is her son. - Give her the baby! 43,415 Come on! Walk! Forward. - In a row! - Fulvio! Have you ever seen such a thing? - So? So? - Doggie! Sitting! And this other one? Get in! All up! 07,249 Get out of here. Step aside. 00,374 We won't do anything to you, what are you yelling at? Break his face! Are you hurt? - Not okay, huh? - I killed him. I told you not to touch me! Look what you've done! Everyone out, come on! - Out! Soon! - They're running away. Everything! Everything! Give me here. - Fulvio! Rag! - Matilda! - Shock, shock. Hello. - Hello! Come state? - Oh! - I don't talk to rabbits. - What could I do? - Electrocute them all. They are people, not insects. But they fry just the same, bzzz. - Like you do? - Disgusting. Cowardly. - Villano! - Enough! I distracted them with flies, and you? Anything. - Yet? - Yeah, again, okay? - But go. - "Ciccarola". "Ciccarola"? A chi? And you are a "stracciarolo"! - Leave me, it hurts. - You give me a kiss. - Huh? - Don't be the "slippery" one. Better a dead mouse than a dirty boy like you. - You have a rubber heart. - No. It's normal. Stay away from me. Look, you hurt yourself. - Calm. - Do not try. Oh! - What a squeak! - I told you. - Shitty kisses! - Do not you ever do it again! You tried it. - The? - Oh! If we don't meet again, we rebel. Eh? - Hello! - It was! - Fulvio! - Where do we go? - At Forte Tiburtino. - Dove? - Al Circus Berlin. Because Franz. - And Israel? - Fuck him! - I have to get back on track. - But what if they arrested him? - Yet! - Let's look for him until tomorrow. - No, I'm busy. - Are you busy? You only think about yourself! And you? Without Israel you don't know how to stay. And you, who must find another master? I have only one boss, the public who pays. But if we separate what do we do? Come with me. But clear terms: It's done as I say. Turn down the hair! You don't give orders to anyone. - And don't come. - Who's coming! I enlist to defend my homeland. You will understand, it is better to surrender immediately. Take care. Go Go. But who wants you! But this cannot... Fulvio! Come on! - Here we go! - Come on, it's getting dark. I'm not coming, Fu. Matilde... Matilde... Me with Matilde. Come on, Mario. It is dangerous to be outside. Matilda with Mario. Mario with Matilda. Matilde... The old man is right about one thing. Use them, these powers. And you? So you see where you put your feet, little girl. Oh, wait for me! Shalom. Help! I beg you,! Italy. Country of shit, Italians of shit. But the wine is good. And whores even better, right? Look, look, look. Who do we have here? Don't you know there's a curfew? Reply! Hey... Where are you going? Hey! Hey! Hey, what's your name? Can't you hear us? What is your name? - How old is she for you? - I don't know, 14 or 15. 02,582 I'll tell you right away. Let's just play a little. Uh, uh, uh! - No, don't touch me. - Do not worry. Let's just play a little bit, okay? - Please don't touch me! - My little Italian dessert. Moritz! Ah! - She's dead? - Dunno. - If he stays here he will die for sure. - Are you going? What a scientist. She pull it up. Ah! - What's up? - It's electric! That? Electric? Your head is electric! 40,332 And we leave a "quatrarella" in the woods? Go away! What are you laughing at?

He wrote it. - What a pussy! - Beautiful! - It's sublime. - Do you have to light it, please? "And There you go". His coat is wonderful. You don't have to be ashamed. - Really? - I never joke about fur. - Me neither. - Do you want to shut up? How asshole you are! No, aaah! Are you the new ones? - Yes. - Come on, come on.

Look, "quatrarella", not to mind your cocks but to adjust my... How the fuck do you do? - To do what? - The shock, right? The Lightning. - The shock? - At moments you would strike us. - Has anyone been hurt? - Gambaletto almost stayed there. - But he's fine now. - Yup. Quiet, he has always been stoned. If I was electric, do you know how many Nazis I killed? A lot. I don't kill anyone. Do you know how many I've killed? Thirty-five! 24 Nazis and 11 Fascists. One just yesterday, right Osvà? A blow to the forehead and pum! Down like a boar. But why don't you join us? I make you a guerrilla and we have fun! Ta-ta-ta... - To kill people? - War is war. You frighten her! Can't you see she's a little girl? - Look... Israel, right? - Yup. 56,665 But where are they taking the Jews? They put them on a train and deport them to Germany. - What if it's okay? - They kill them! Stop it! Don't listen to him, polio has burned his brain. - To "mammeta"! - 00:59:15,540 But can your electricity go far? Where is it? - Yet? - Let me see. There is nothing to see. I swear I'll help you find your friend. - For real? - Word of Gobbo. E dai, spara... No! You are a stalwart! And you stink as well. Fuck off! - And you're a pain in the ass. - And you are special. You have a gift. It is not a gift. It's a curse. But are you afraid of killing someone? The first few times it hurts, but then you get used to it. I know how to atone for your sins. - And how? - In battle, with us. - But I'm just a circus performer. - And me, just a hunchback.

Franz has six fingers, and he wanted to fight. - AND...? - They didn't make him do shit. I was there, at the military medical examination. The doctors laugh when they saw his hands! Since then, God only knows why, thinks that there are freaks of nature with special powers like him. When I'm not what he thought... kills them. It is his gift to Hitler. Supermen with him in charge.
