No stress! We'll fix those street lights! Everything's gonna be ALL WHITE! Nothing to fear. You all were a mess before we got here. You go burn that lease and please be civilized or else we'll have to call the police. Could you believe this black man had the nerve to walk a tad bit too close to me? He looked just like one of those rappers on TV. I got uncomfortable, went ahead and dialed the authorities. It's okay to sell your soul. We'll revive your local bar, advertise it with a bullet hole. We'll buy your properties so low as you watch your community cripple. Wait 'til you're gone, flip it, and then sell it for triple. Enough with culture, diversity, artist, musician, actor. Where or however they end up to me, it's just not a factor. But hey, no racists here. I voted for Obama, all lives matter. ♪ Beautiful, Brooklyn was ♪ ♪ When you were here Brooklyn was beautiful ♪ ♪ Brooklyn was beautiful ♪ ♪ Brooklyn was beautiful ♪ ♪ When you were here, Brooklyn was beautiful ♪ ♪ When you were here, Brooklyn was beautiful ♪ ♪ When you were here, Brooklyn was beautiful ♪ You all right, Nate? Yeah. After what happened yesterday, man, I'd have thought you'd have stayed home today, bruh. Man, there's nothing to do there but smoke weed. At least you can do it all you want now, without listening to her complain. I'm already as high as I'm gonna get, dude. Figured I might as well come in and cut some hair, make some money. Whoa, word on the street is, there's a new bachelor on the loose my man. You told him? Nothing we didn't already know. Y'all were together five years man, that was supposed to be wifey. You weren't even supposed to be here today. Uh huh. Must feel good man, getting the place back to yourself getting in the groove like a player, hear me? No man, it's not even like that. I look around, it's fucking ghost town in my house. All I see is nothing, I feel these moments of our love everywhere. I touch shit, it's just love emanating out of couches and cushions. Oh lord, you sound like a bitch now. Yeah man, you call your mother yet? Yo, I'm a man my dude, why you gotta talk about my mom? No need to get swoll my dude. You know what and fuck you, because you're the one who put all my business out in the street. And you know what? You just sit there and you read your 50-year-old Ebony magazines. We're all gonna work in silence today. I don't know none of you motherfuckers. Who he think he is? Shit! Yo brother, if you didn't want to talk about it, you'd have kept your silent ass home today. I'm not allowed to work? I can't make money? I'm just saying, bruh. Melissa left yesterday. We know. We know. My brother... What happened? Nothing, what? You didn't tell them? Psh, I didn't tell them everything. I wasn't there for everything. I was just there for the beat down. She hit you? She did not hit me, no, she didn't hit me. Why do you want her to stay if she is hitting you? That's that gender equality. Stop it, no she didn't hit me. - Are you sure? - Yes. Because it is classic for abuse victims to deny everything. That's true. You know what..? Mosey, come on. She didn't hit him. Thank you. At least not when I was there. Okay. I don't know what happened after that. You know what? I am in pain, I lost somebody. It doesn't matter man, she's not dead. You're just not hitting it from the back anymore, man, that's all. A broken heart really needs a little levity, okay? So why you got to be such a sour puss? We all friends man, now let's talk, talk it out. Now who sounds like the bitch? Yo, Chess, why don't you hit him off with your liquid breakfast man, loosen him up, man. Get his mind right. Shit, you don't smell the weed on him? He's already high. So all right then, Nate, What's good? How'd it go down, bruh? Oh goodness. That was I'm gonna miss you, that was... I'm gonna miss you a lot. I'm going to miss you, too. You still love me? I'm not doing this anymore, Nate. We're moving on. I'm trying not to love you. Yeah, your logic is tight. But, yes. If that's what you're wondering. Yeah, kinda. Yeah, I mean I know I wasn't the only one that felt something just now when we were, you know, bonin'. That extra minute was special because I didn't get you an anniversary gift two weeks ago. You know what I was thinking while you were in the shower? What? I was thinking that maybe this isn't really happening. It's happening. My mother always said it's better to break up while you still love someone. Breaking up while you hate someone usually ends in murder. Yeah, but that's my point, we don't hate each other, right? We love each other, we said it a bunch of times in that flurry of passion. That flurry of passion was a goodbye fuck. It was? You were the one who said 'How about a goodbye fuck?' That's right. I obliged. Can't believe I did that. I knew you'd twist everything the second it was over. What? I'm not twisting anything! I just think we don't have to break up because we had great sex. For us, great sex, we were in there crying it was all emotional, I mean, doesn't that mean anything? Does it? You want to know what I was thinking about in the shower? Maybe. I was wondering how long will it take to wash your smell off of me, because I don't want to smell you tonight when I go to sleep in my new home and you know what? I can still smell you. Fuck! Let's just forget this morning ever happened. No, I don't want to forget what happened this morning. I do, think about something else. Don't you have school work? It'll get done. I bet if you had your study partner you'd be more focused. See, you want me to leave you alone, but you keep bringing up bullshit. Fine. And another thing, I want my teapot back. You mean the teapot you bought me? I bought it for the apartment. When I moved in you heated your water in the microwave, like a heathen. What are you talking about, "heathen"? That shit is technology. It's mine, I'm taking it. So you don't want tea, then? Yes? Yes. I don't want to talk about it, just get over here now. I don't give a shit about Alternate Side, I'll pay for the ticket. Here you go and don't forget you got the sneakers by the door. Yeah, I know. Oh, and I'm gonna need your address for the mail. No you won't. Don't you care about your mail? Why do you think I found in apartment in secret? I'm already getting my mail there, thanks. Yeah, but you know sometimes... You know what, anything that slips through the mail Nate you can have, go crazy. Okay, you know what? I was just trying to be nice. You want this to be nice? Nicer than this. I have nothing to be nice about. You have nothing to be a bitch about. Fuck you. You already did that today and that still didn't chill you out. You're a fucking waste. You know what? Your heart wouldn't be breaking over a fucking waste, babe. You cheated on me, that's why I'm a bitch. You want a bitch, you got a bitch, you ungrateful motherfucker. Not ungrateful, listen I know that you helped me get a lot of shit straight in my life. Damn right, I did. Okay, I said thank you, right? What else do you want from me? You could have thanked me before you went and fucked a 20 year old. Slow down, all right. I did not do nothin'- Oh see another lie. And I'm pretty sure that that's not a lie okay. What? You say you're at school, but it's not on your schedule. You say you're with Mosey, but really you were with those BMCC girls. I like your place. Thanks. How's the rent? I don't talk about it. Your girlfriend handle the decorating? Yeah, yeah, she's got a little skill. She fixed this place up. Before she moved in, all I did was decorate with magazines. I've actually been looking for a place. Are there any spots open like this? No. The only way to get a place like this is to be really rich or to live here your whole life and wait for your parents to die. You just saying that because you don't want me to live here. No, it's true, my mom owns this building and you know she wants to kick me out so she can get more for rent. So the idea that I'm gonna help you, is not very likely. So basically you don't want no trouble? Oh see now you're just messing with me. So you gonna tell me you don't feel what's happening? With what? With you and me? What? Nate, I heard about you, stop. All right, listen, all right, okay, sometimes I get a little reckless if there's a party, but this is my girlfriend's place, too, so if we're done studying, you know... You wasn't talking about her last week when we was dancing. Okay yeah I was flirting with you, but-- You flirt with everybody. I'm a DJ. That's what' DJs do, that's how I get tips. - A DJ? - Yeah, I gotta flirt a little bit. - Listen. You and I connect on some real shit. ♪ You know what you get ♪ ♪ Everyday is Christmas ♪ ♪ Oh yeah there ain't no conditions ♪ Oh okay, yeah you, music is definitely more your thing. You like that? Yeah, that was really-- Okay, Justine, you are young enough to be my niece. Don't you have a boyfriend? He plays basketball for St. Johns. It's an open relationship. Yeah, I guess that's the way you'd have to go with that. You got condoms? That's you kids don't mince, do you? Why waste time with words? I'm hot, you're a six, let's do this. Okay listen, Justine, I know what you think is going to happen, but I-- Okay six, a six is your bottom for getting freaky? This isn't getting freaky. This is studying. That's why I thought you called me here today, the whole group canceled, it's just me and you. I thought I was helping you out. You did, thanks. Yeah. Listen, I've always been attracted to older men. Oh man, there it is, see I knew that was gonna come. Facts. Thank you Justine. Yeah, that's great, oh, that's really nice. Thank you, okay. Thank you, that's let's you an Uber. You know what listen, I don't care about your girlfriend. That that makes one of us. Yeah, but does she know what most men want? What's that? Someone who can keep a secret. Okay, then well please keep this one. You want me to touch him? Okay, thank you, no, you've got to go, you've got to go. I'm not an idiot, you fucked her. I did not. I love how every time you tell the story, you are somehow the hero just trying to preserve everyone's honor. Are you saying that isn't me? Not if it's the same Justine who takes selfies with her ass sticking out. Learn how to close your apps. You practically live on her Instagram. Okay, well you're worse than the NSA. Nate, I know you think you're smart, but you're not smart. You're stupid, okay? You're stupid, you didn't even try to hide it you left her fucking wine glass out with the lip stain all over it. Justine brought the wine, she was trying to impress me because I'm so dope, like you used to try to impress me, but you don't anymore, because you don't think I'm dope. You know the whole place smelled of her cheap ass perfume. That's not my fault. You changed the sheets. You didn't clean up anything else she left behind, but you changed the sheets, you made sure to change the sheets. Why is that? Since when have you ever even about doing that? Well. Of course. You don't have an answer because you're guilty. I'm not guilty. You changed the sheets. I didn't sleep with that chick. You changed the sheets. - Yeah because-- - Because you slept with her in our bed, well you keep the bed now. I just said that she came over and things got a little hot, but I got a hard-on okay, I'll admit that shit, but nothing happened with her. Okay, I kicked her out and frankly kicking her out didn't do shit for my blue balls, so I went into the bedroom and I stroked it off and you know I got a little on the sheets and pillows, well I got a LOT, a lot on the sheets and pillows, because even if it's only three minutes, I'm like Lexington Steele when I pop, I mean that shit was just everywhere so I just gathered everything up, put it in the laundry bag, didn't have time to wash it and get it back on the, you were about to come home. I'm just lucky you didn't walk in with a black light. See? Look, the gears are turning, see you know that I'm telling the truth. I, I don't... Maybe it's stupid enough to be true. And you just called me stupid. I was wondering why the sheets didn't smell of her perfume, you didn't have time to wash them and there were never any hairs or other fluids. Who the hell are you supposed to be, CSI? Of course there were no other hairs or fluids, just my man juice, a pretty girl came onto me, so I stroked it off, sue me! Whoa, is this what, that's what this is about? That's what you had to go on? Cora said-- Cora said?!? Oh! Cora said?!? Cora's the one fucking up my shit right now because I like to jerk off in bed instead of in front of a computer, like your brother. She said it seemed suspicious. Well, she was wrong, wasn't she? It did seemed suspicious. It seemed suspicious because she made it up. That doesn't make any fucking sense! All right fine, you didn't cheat, happy? That's the best you got? I'm sorry, Nate. It's okay, I forgive you. 'Cuz I love you we just suck at communicating and I'm gonna do a better job of letting you in. I've been watching a lot of OWN, because I'm trying to fix all of this. I just have to go Nate. And now I want tea, shit. Okay, when people have trouble communicating, they talk it out or they get help, only punks cut and run. Then I'm a punk. Okay, but you're not still mad at me, right? - What? - Well I mean this whole breakup thing was because you thought that I hit it with Justine, which I did not, so. Not everything is about you and Justine, and besides I don't know that you didn't sleep with her. Yeah, but you have doubts though. I have doubts about Justine. I don't have doubts there were others. Why do you think I didn't sleep with Justine? - Can we stop-- - No no no no, seriously, do you have any idea why I didn't sleep with her? Tell me. Because flirting is automatic, not emotion. Yeah, that is right and she's a knucklehead. Why am I gonna get emotional over some knucklehead for, huh? Knucklehead's can't measure up to the future that you and I were building. I didn't sleep with Justine because I believed in us. I didn't hit it for the same reason that you never cheated on me. What? This is gonna be a tough midterm. Not if we've done our jobs right. We both teach sixth grade, but I don't think as much of my students as you do. This shit is hard. Jason, it's just a midterm. You want some more tea? You know it shouldn't be a crime to challenge sixth graders. That's what I teach my students, what do you teach yours? Mostly what their rights are if ever they're held by the police. So where's Nate tonight? DJing some college party. But it's Wednesday. He had his midterms too. Guess he's letting off some steam with his friends. You don't want to go? Please. I'm over it. These are his college years, let him has his fun. Oh well, it's great that you also support him. We have an understanding. Well he's lucky. But you deserve to have some fun too. Right? ♪ One with each rising and setting of the sun ♪ ♪ Whatever may come, I'm about to have fun ♪ ♪ Cut my losses, grin it and bear it ♪ ♪ Rather I bury it, don't force it ♪ ♪ And won't forfeit ♪ So he starts getting these phone calls at four in the morning. I know what's going on, but what's the point in complaining now? He's what I deserve. Hey, hey, you don't deserve anything but to be happy. We don't even talk about marriage anymore. You're engaged? I'm getting married this summer. Happy? Very. That's some slutty shit! I hate you! Obviously! Oh sure, now you want tea. Well at least I don't have to smoke or drink at all hours of the day like some people. No, only when you're cheating on some people! I didn't cheat, I was retaliating! Get the hell out of here? She said that? How? How? Because you slept with Justine in our bed. What? You just said that you know I didn't sleep with Justine. I didn't know that at the time and even if it wasn't Justine, there were others Nate, in other beds, don't lie to me. There were others. Oh! She flipped it like that? Yup. Yo real talk. I didn't think she had it in her like that. And she knows that nothing happened with Justine? Yeah. But she gave this guy some trim to get back at you for screwing her? Yeah. And she definitely fucked him in your bed? Yes. She washed the sheets? Yeah, she must have dude, I didn't even know about it till yesterday. Whoa! Hey, see that's how they do. Hell, Nate, how do you keep from blowing your brains out man? That's some ruthless shit that she did there. No it ain't. It's justice. Are you serious, Lou? Your boy got played. Look, you're my man 50-stacks-shirt-off-my-back, but you know was dead wrong for messing with that young girl or any of them girls for that matter. You're supposed to be in here getting your life together, trying to get up out the shop, but instead you running around here like you're on Love and Hip Hop. That's your problem. You know what your problem is? You think you can solve everything with your stupid rhymes. Whether it happened or not, you wanted me to think that you fucked or could have fucked those stupid college girls. That is what your ego is about, making yourself believe you have a big dick and making me feel like shit. How can they be stupid if they're in college? I was stupid in college. What? You know what? Maybe I wouldn't have to cheat if every time we had sex you didn't have to wait for it to be over. I wouldn't have to cheated if you didn't smell like Patchouli, Hennessy and weed every time you climbed on top of me. That doesn't even matter. You brought another dude here. You shouldn't be moving out, I should be kicking you out. And what should have been the final straw for me? How many chances did I give you before Justine? Nothing happened with Justine. What about April, Lexi, Cinnamon? Oh yeah yeah, I know about her, that you put a part of your body into the mouth of someone named Cinnamon. I don't even know how I can look at you. How'd you find out about that? What is that? You didn't win anything, you just slept with a married man. Engaged. Same difference, he's married now. Well, it was only once and that's something that Jason and his wife will have to figure out. This is the same woman that teaches children. How do you get to judge me after what you did? I get to judge you after five years of cheating on me. Yeah, for all you know, all my cheating was exaggerated, but what you did was premeditated. No. Yeah, yeah, that's what you do, you just brought him over here to seduce you. No. I know what you do, you find some little idiot off the banana boat and you bide your time and then you claws into, your fangs into him. I know how that works. I didn't bring him over here to seduce him. I knew that he would try to seduce me and I figured I'd just let the chips fall wherever they may fall and-- That's some whore shit. Whore! Whore! Cinnamon, Cinnamon, Cinnamon! ♪ Day-O Day-O Day-O ♪ It doesn't matter what you say about Justine, you're a liar, I didn't just get pictures off your phone, stupid. You know what? Good, get the fuck out of here. I'm gonna need you to move your stuff off my desk. Don't worry I'm moving it. I've been asking you all week so-- Hey, I said I'm moving it, you're still packing. Well now I'm kinda in a hurry. What took you so long? I told you I wanted to be out by noon. Talk to Cora, I was ready. She had me waiting outside her place for like 45 minutes. I didn't know what to wear. We're moving dusty boxes, does it matter? They're dusty boxes? Okay do you have a shirt I can borrow? Look if I get a ticket, you're paying it. I told you I would, didn't I? Look, that's my mother-in-law's van, I finally got her liking me. I don't need you messing that up. You know how hard it is to get a Dominican mother-in-law to like a black dude? That shit is muy difficulto. Damn, you got mad shit up in here. Will it fit? Well, we gonna make it fit, because I ain't coming back here. - Melissa, shirt? - Come on. Hi, Nate. Yo kiss my ass, Cora. - Ah shit. - Yeah shit. What'd you tell her, what'd you tell her? I told her the truth. That what, Justine was suspicious? She was, it was, the whole thing was suspicious. Why, we're working together? Why did you have to work here? Because study group, that's why. Yo, is this desk coming with-- I'm moving it, damn. The fuck is he talking to? You told her to check the sheets. That's what I would have done in her situation. But you're never in her situation, because you don't get attached. And this is why, the pain. Men are pigs and you're a man, so... This is what you're listening to. Nate, at the very least you should not have been studying alone with another woman in the apartment you share with girlfriend. I mean come on, dude, did you not think that will make her feel uncomfortable? Okay. I'm sorry. Thank you. We can agree on something. Nothing happened with Justine. Says you, why don't you tell her that shit, you tell her all my other business in the street, why don't you tell her that shit? Tell her. His story actually makes sense. - In your face! - Okay, well what about the sheets? Don't worry about my sheets. You keep your mind out of my sheets. I don't worry about the sheets? No, you don't worry about, no we don't gotta talk about my sheets anymore. Fine, well what-- Point is you were wrong. - Whatever, whatever. - You were wrong. Whatever, you won one, congratulations Nate. Why can't you just mind your own business? She's my best friend, she is my business. So why don't you get some facts before you spread out advice like diarrhea? I don't understand Nate. Are you angry because we were right that you did have another woman here or that I care about my friend? Get out of my house, you first, quickly, get the fuck out. Now. He's gonna change his tone. He's gonna stop cussing at me. What? I'm not gonna miss you. Ted, we were never fucking. Yeah, because I never liked you. I'm pretty sure that's not the only reason. I mean she helps you get on your feet and you repay her by messing around with sluts. They're called students. I don't know what took us so long to see that you are cocky, narcissistic, no talent nobody. You're nothing but a pretend DJ and a terrible barber. I ain't forget how you fucked up my head. If my mother was alive to see what a piece of shit my sister wound up with, she'd never stop stabbing her eyes out. Are you gonna help me move this shit, so you can hurry up and get back to the top of the Empire State Building, motherfucker? You look like the fifth Ninja Turtle, the brown one. Yeah, get that one, move that shit Kong. Girl, I lent this to you like a year ago. Well now you have it back. I wanted to get your clothes dirty. What's wrong? How am I any different from Nate? If he didn't really sleep with that chick then me and Jason, that was for nothing. No it wasn't. Girl, Jason is hot, Nate is like a three. Why did I even listen to you? Revenge fucking, what am I, 19? Okay, I'm sorry I was wrong about one thing, I'm not perfect. But you wouldn't stop talking about it, so I know you had fun. I couldn't stop talking about it because I felt guilty. Yeah right, guilty, #humblebrag. So nothing happened with her? Who, Justine? No. So you're honestly going to stand there and tell us that you've never been with any other woman besides Melissa? Nah, you know what's-- No, don't worry about what I know. We're concerned with what I don't know. Because if you can actually say no, then maybe we were wrong and this can be worked out. All right, well once. - Once? - See? Cinnamon, Cinnamon I told you about her. Yeah, yeah that's why you're admitting it. Cinnamon?!? You fucked a stripper is what you're saying. She's a stripper. First of all, she's not a stripper. She goes to church every Sunday and it was once. Once. - Really? - Yeah. Because I vividly remember seeing you at a bar in Williamsburg flirting with some Asian chick in a Mets cap. You disappeared into the bathroom for like 15 minutes. I saw you, but you definitely didn't see me. - Okay, maybe twice. - Twice? - Oh. - Ain't shit motherfucker. - That's what I'm saying. - Three, four, five, six. What did I tell you about this guy? Why? What? I told you-- The whole time he was lying. - Want to give it to me that I don't know? - This is not what mommy would have wanted. - All right, don't even go there right now. - You slept with some hard heads. - Look at him. You don't listen. - Ganging up on me for. Hi Nate. - What's up man? Yeah, sure. See man that's the thing about you, right? You can't be trusted, first it's once, then it's twice, then it's just an Asian chick in a bar bathroom. - What's up, Mosey? - What's up, man? - Did I come at a bad time? - No no, fuck these ghosts. - Want some of this? - Yeah man, I'll hit that. Want to borrow something else? Oh, man, if I could... Yeah, man hit them stacks. Ooh, I can't wait till we get rid of you. See you're a piece of shit man, you've got piece of shit friends. Whoa whoa. - And you like piece of shit girls. Yo, you should take that back man, because I love your sister. Pssh, doubt it, you only seem to love yourself. Ted, you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about man. Hey get the fuck out of my way. She's not no saint, now what you telling my boy Ted here? Gotta all up in the clouds, she ain't no saint, dude. Word? - Yeah, that's right. You know what she did? She brought another dude back here to fuck him. That's right, son. Oh, you didn't know about that. You didn't tell Ted all about this shit? Yeah, she got another dude back here to fuck him all because she thought that I cheated on her, which I did not, everyone should know that I did not cheat on her, that shit should be canon by now. Nate, just shut up. What, what, Ted wants to make judgements, he should make all the judgments. She slept with some guy? That's right. So I'm supposed to be on your side now? Yeah, she's stupid. Look man, I love her too, but she's stupid for sticking around with your poot butt ass for so damn long. Look man, she's a lady and you like club hos. Club? This nigger, club hos? Look man, we knew this wasn't going to last, right? Some clown that she met in the subway, look she would have been better off with the rats. Oh pump your breaks, nigger, subway, the fuck you talking about, you told, you told him we met on the subway? How long are we staying? - As long as you want. - I want to leave now. No stop it, come on we're gonna have fun, yas? You made it! Of course, where's your boy? Over there. My niggas! Okay, birthday boy getting funky. You ladies want some drinks? They got bottled beer? I think they got a Corona or something. I'll take one of those. Unopened. Okay. For you? Just give me something special, surprise me. All right, I'll be back. Just give me something special. You're just asking to get roofied. Just being nice. You hardly know him. What is your problem? You said you would try to have a good time tonight. And you told me we were going to a movie. This is better, come on, chill out, mingle. Or you can just call him back and tell him that you've changed your mind and that you'll marry him and move to Cleveland. - Columbus. - What? Vincent wants to get married and move to Columbus. How is that better? Dranks, dranks, dranks. Mm. Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Once upon a time in Kings County Hospital, a black boy was born, this boy is all Brooklyn, he's all black. His is Bud Baxter. Today's his birthday!

Yeah. Yeah, I like love this neighborhood. How do you even afford this? I grew up here. My mom owns this place, so I'm never gonna leave. Shit, well you let me know if you want a roommate. All right. It's empty, do you mind? No doubt. - Melissa? - I'm good. Okay. This is you, kid. Don't fuck it up, they want it. - What are you doing? - What? - Leave. - Are you kidding? Do you see the chemistry that we have? You've trained for this, pace yourself. You have a guy. Yeah, well he turned out to be a loser, so... And you only discovered this after having your tongue down his throat all night? How else you gonna find out? But who gets you first? I mean what if I die during it? I mean they're both pretty hot, like an eight, but what if they die during it? I'm pretty hot, like a nine. I can't handle no dead bodies. He didn't even invite you back here. You just glommed on. Oh, he wants me here, believe that. Yeah, the way you're throwing it at him. I don't have to throw all of this. What's wrong with you? You don't even like Cora how did she get back here? Damn, these chicks stick together. Oh shit, it's a cock block. Damn it, I walked into another cock block. All right girl it's time for you to go. Okay, I will let you have this one, only because you never have any fun. I'm sure you'll make it up by fucking someone after church tomorrow. Ah you see how you got bitch in you? That's why you about to have dick in you! Who says that? Gave it up on the first night son! Two out of three holes right there, your sister. Why are you playing with my man Ted like that? He don't know what a freak you are? Yo, you better shut the fuck up man. What are you saying, man? What are you saying? That's what she did, that's what we're talking about, that's what you wanted to know. Yo Ted, it was just sex from the giddy up, straight up jump street, you know why? Because that's how I role man, that's what Bud Baxter do. Man, shut the fuck up. What the fuck is wrong with you nigger? Oh now, I got this shit, I got this shit, no man, what's up, you want to step, step to me man. I'll take both you out motherfuckers. Oh really? Let me explain something to you Ted, mixing it up, meet some couple of hotty pants, they want to get in your fucking pants, you bring them back to your apartment, show them that's exposed brick, they get all fucking wet. Those panties come off, nigger. - Shut the fuck up. - Nate! What, don't even act like I wasn't gonna get that threesome, that shit was on the fucking table. I could have had you both upside down on a sex swing-- - Nate! - Shut up Nate! But it turned into a respectful butt naked sex for two because your sister has such morals. My dude! What! - Ted, Ted, no. - Fuck you. My dude, you almost had the triple cheeseburger. With a best friend. You my hero now. Mosey, why you ain't say nothing? I found out when the fight jumped off. Nate, if I was you, I'd lead with that. Why? We giving niggers credit for almost now? If that's the case I can almost hook you up with Deez. Deez who? - Deez nuts in your mouth! - Oh! - Got you, Chest! - Deez nuts, deez nuts. But you, seriously though, so did he wear your out or what? Are you serious dude? Why would you automatically assume that I got my ass kicked? You cut hair. So what's your saying is, if I hadn't left your birthday party early, I could have taken Cora home? Home to do what? To show her pictures of you and Jesus at prom together you old motherfucker? You know what to be honest with you man. Even if you would have married ol' girl, you and her brother would have never got along. To be honest, y'all probably should have locked hands months ago. Facts. - That's what you get punk. - Ted stop. Bro calm down man or it's gonna be you and me next time. I ain't got a glass jaw. - What the fuck? - Call them like I see them. You know what, I'm calling the cops. - No you're not. - Oh yes I am. To hell with that. You can't do that, you know I got a warrant. I'm calling them, you don't live here, bring your big ass brother in here to fuck me up, no no no you all going down, hell with that shit. You broke my phone, motherfucker! You're paying for that shit, you know that right? Fuck you! - I'll pay for it. - Really? You're gonna by some more shit for this man? - Not now. - Oh please shut the fuck up! Shut up! Can y'all let me go now, huh? Bro, you gonna calm down? Yeah, I'm good Hov. Damn, Jigga Man. Baby Gap shopping ass nigger. Let's just stop talking okay? Listen man, you want me to hang around in case he starts tripping again? No man, I got this I can handle it. No actually you don't, that's why I'm asking you. His knuckles have had enough. Listen man, if he starts tripping again, don't call me. All right, you know what you do to defend yourself? Pull your dick out. What? Pull your dick and your balls out. That's right, nobody want to fight motherfucker got their dick out. Some motherfuckers tried to jack me one night, you know what I did? Pulled my dick out, right on them, that's right, scattered like roaches. Nobody gonna fight you with your dick out, man. - All right? - All right. Take care of yourself man. - Got you. - All right. Thank you. Love you, boy. Just pick up the other stuff. I don't need your help, Nate. You want to get out of here sooner or not? Next time you want to give someone advice, why don't you tell her to get some movers? My advice is not the reason you cheated on Melissa, so we're clear. Can't you stop? We could have worked this out, you could have just kept your mouth shut. Kept my mouth shut for what? For a man who doesn't respect my friend? Where do you get that from? Shit like that. Do you think it was appropriate for you to tell her brother anything about her sex life? Okay, I get it, so you both to get to put me on blast but I can't say anything about her and that dude in my own bed? And you don't have to make up that shit about the threesome. The fuck did I make up? That shit was gonna happen. Don't flatter yourself, Nate. Please, she tells me everything. I already know you pop quicker than a bag of Orville Redenbacher. There was never any chance of us hooking up, I can assure you. I seen you do a lot worse than me. Yeah, but you'll never do better than Melissa. You know what, you don't know what's gonna happen, the whole fucking thing is random, I could have hooked up with you that night and then right now I'd be breaking up with your ass. No no no, I would have dumped you much sooner. No doubt, but that doesn't mean you get to stand here and put a hex on my whole damn future love life. For the record Nate, I don't hate you. I don't think I was asking. I know somewhere deep in your black twisted heart you actually tried to be good to her. Oh, thanks, that's very generous of you. I heard about the good stuff too. Ooh nice. It's just this thing you guys do now, where like, you want to be kids forever and you wear T-shirts and go to superhero movies on opening night instead of watching the news or reading a book, it's just really shitty for a woman who want to be with real men. You saying I'm not a man? No, obviously you're a man, but what was your father doing at 35? Or your grandfather? I bet I wouldn't even question their manhood and I don't even know the dudes. Maybe you will meet a woman as great as Melissa and maybe she'll meet a guy that she loves as much as she loves you. Except he'll be a man all the time, not just when it's convenient for him. Shit, maybe you'll both do better and stop sucking at everything. You're not a bad guy Nate, you're just a bad boyfriend. I should probably go see if they need help rearranging the van or something. Yeah I doubt it and are you gonna take a box? Nope. I don't think that's what these bowls are for. Oh sorry. It's okay, but let's eat this looks really good, you did a great job. Thank you, I was trying to impress you a little bit. So what should we do after dinner? Oh, whatever you want to do. You don't have to work? No, this whole evening is just for you. I mean I was thinking of playing fewer parties anyway. Why, Nate, you might actually convince me you're ready to settle down. Oh snap. What do you I have to convince you like still? What do you think all of this is? Now listen lady, we are not married or anything, but we have bills together, our credit is intertwined. I gave you my Netflix password. I don't just throw that shit around. - No you right, you right. - You're stuck with me. I'm like a tick. I'm gonna give you Lyme disease of love. - Ooh. - Yeah. This shit is serious. Bonnie and Clyde, Mary J and Method Man. Ooh, that's some real love right there. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Okay. - Can you handle that? - Mm-hmm. - All right, Faith Evans and Biggie. Don't die. - Well, don't kill me. - Ooh. You like rocking these huh? - You like them. - Yes, I do like them, you look damn sexy in them. I just don't want you wearing them to school because some big ass sixth grader might make you his woman. Some of those sixth graders don't take no for an answer. I doubt you could take them. What? That's how it is, you would just up and leave me for some kid. I mean, what can I say? I'm a vampire. They trust you. I didn't know that I was gonna be with a vampire. Oh ho ho. Nice. I figured it was better than your other backpack. It's great, thank you, I love it. Here. Ah. Yeah, I saw you looking at them, so... Yeah, I was looking at them because-- Wait, you don't like them? No, that's not true, they're great. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Ah! - Ah, Happy New Year! - Happy new year. - Thank you. Oh this is ew, no, where's the Hennessy, where's the Hennessy? - No this is-- - Oh oh, why? What? You drink this shit? - You gotta upgrade your palate. - Uh uh. Classy. You don't know that at all. I think that's where your energy comes from. That's the source of my energy? Yeah. It's all in the shoulder. What are you doing? Come on! We're almost done. I'm sorry, I just need a moment. You better not be changing your mind. I'm not, I'm just I'm really gonna miss this neighborhood. I swear I don't see what's so special about it. It's historical, I ever tell you that Shirley Chisholm lived around the corner? - Nah. - And Laurence Fishburne. At least that's what one of the neighbors told me. So you stuck on this place because Cornbread, Earl and Me used to live out here? That's cool and all, but I don't really care. Mamasita Reyes wants her van back by six. I just want to appreciate the history of this neighborhood. History is for people that are afraid to learn something new. Enjoy your new place. A place I'm gonna go broke paying rent in. I should have got a roommate. At least you saved a ton of money living with this clown. I pay $450 a month. His mom charges him $900 a month to live here? I know right, she's actually being nice. That's a fact. Cheap rent in Brooklyn is a powerful aphrodisiac. See there you go getting into TMI territory again. I already learned enough about you today. Come on, Cornbread, you help me get this van back by six. I'll get you a soda pop. - Melissa. - What? I'm sorry. I've owed you that for some time. Well, today's not about what I'm owed and besides, you don't even know what you're apologizing for. Well, not specifically but I know that I hurt you I love you and I lost sight of that and ya know we made mistakes, I made mistakes, you made mistakes but we can still forgive each other and I really need you to forgive me right now. You have to believe me. I do believe you, Nate. We're a good match. We were once. When we were fighting, it just came out of nowhere. First it was nowhere, then it was everywhere. You remember when you first moved here? How we used to shower together? I don't think I showered alone at all that first year. How did that stop? - Nate. - Please listen to me. Say what? I've given you every chance to say anything and everything and you know what you've said? Nothing. Nothing. - I'm saying it now. I-don't want to hear it now. What do you want me to do? What? - Tell me what you want me to do. - I want you to let me go. Please, just stay here. Why are you moving? Nate, we can't live together we tried we failed. If you stayed, we can do this. That's your big motivational speech? Nate, that's crazy and I've spent enough time being crazy over you. And, Nate, you spent enough time being crazy over me, too. We don't work. We do work, you're still here, you're still talking to me, something's keeping you here. You're still holding my hand-- Other than that. There's still a chance. - Nate, there's no chance. - Really? - Even after this morning? - Forget about this morning. No, this morning happened, that's... You don't feel anything when I'm standing this close to you? When I'm holding your hands this way? You don't remember this? You don't feel anything? Why? Stop. Stop! - You kissed me this morning. - Why are you doing this? Maybe that's why you shouldn't leave. Maybe I should, if all we're good for is three minutes in the bedroom. Really? We're not good for three minutes in the bedroom. We're good right here, these moments. This isn't real? This doesn't feel honest? This... tell me something honest right now. Tell me what you're feeling. - Nate I-- - No, just honesty, go. I'm gonna miss the floors here. Okay. - Is it my turn? - Sure. - I want to kiss you. - Don't. - I said don't. - You don't feel anything? I said don't. What the hell is wrong with you? Crying like a baby with shit-stained lollipop? This dude. I don't know what I was thinking. Yeah, I know what you were thinking you were thinking the yellow-faced emoji with the hearts for eyes, that's what you were thinking. That's what happens when you take them goodbye fucks too far. Every time. Nate, all you young fellows listen up, see you all have watched too much Oprah and too many Denzel movies and you think you have to be oh sensitive. What that get you? On your face, on your face. You two ever been caught up in this kind of mess? - No. - No. Lying niggers, right there. Both of you, both of you. You never made no mistakes? You all perfect? I'm on my face, but you're all perfect right? - Damn near it. - Uh huh. He probably leaving out the part where he was on his knees begging. What did you do? That's private. Wrong. You don't have anything private concerning her anymore. He has some nerve. So what after some magical kiss you're just supposed to say? I did feel something Cora. Of course you felt something you're in love. - I am. - You're in love, not captivity. - You're a man, I guess. I mean you have men friends, if a guy like you can have friends. Get on with it. See I hope that you have a lot of friends because you're gonna need them to get off a woman like her. Okay Ted, uh, you know loving your sister is great, it's very noble and shit, but you are making it very creepy right now. You know why you'll always be lonely? Tell me. Why am I leaving? How was this any worse than other fight we've had? Do you really need a reason? Yes, right now I do. Just one? Just one. You're selfish. He's selfish. And a smart woman like her can smell a selfish guy like you coming a mile away. And you're not. You give too much. Believe me, I should know, I'm selfish, too. So then you're gonna be left with the stupid girls but you'll get bored with the stupid girls, because believe it or not, you're a smart guy, Nate. But just because you've made some bad decisions doesn't mean you have to live with them, literally. So without the dumb girls, what else is there? Your mother. Possibly. I mean a lot of guys do end up with their momma. If you don't leave today, you're gonna be counting down the days until you have to leave again. See look, don't be that guy. Not here. Be that guy with your friends, but here, you don't have any anymore. Woo! What's up? Who is Karen? I don't know. You got her number in the pocket of the jeans you worse last night, but you don't know. What, you going through my jeans now? I am doing your laundry because I'm a kind person and I love you but I guess me being kind is just me being a fool. I don't know who she is. - Don't lie to me. I-'m not lying. - I'm not. - No, you ain't sleeping.

Being together. That's what this is about now, a promise?

Even Stevie Wonder can see, this dude is not trying to give up them sneakers. Hold up, when somebody leaves something behind, doesn't it mean that they secretly want to come back? Air Jesus are you for real? Nate, stop the drugs. Yo Nate, it means that they was in such a rush to leave that they didn't care what they left behind. The point of no return in this relationship, bruh, was when Ted kicked your ass. That was it, curtain call baby. Look man, she wasn't in a rush okay? She didn't like him at first, but you know what she wore them all the time. Why because they meant something to her, because I meant something to her you get that? Yeah but why are you keeping them, huh? Is she gonna call you and you gonna run over with the sneaker ambulance or something? Oh Lord. This boy's gone.

Fuck the chain and I take his rebound pussy. Don't do it, Nate, don't do it to yourself. Walking around all bitter with your chest held tight. Don't turn out like Chester. Fuck you. That was fucked up. Why do you gotta call my name for? What I done to you? Hello. Hi. Hi. Where are you? In my room. - Where are you? - At home. Where else would I be? Friday night, a BMCC orgy. Oh, this is why you called me? No. I'm bored. You miss me? Yes. I miss you too. It's not like I'm gonna keep on calling you or anything I just... I wanted to hear your voice. No, it's okay. It's okay, I wanted to hear your voice, too. But you didn't call me? You sound surprised. I am. Well, I figured you just needed your space and even if you didn't, you would just tell me you did. You have me all figured out. If I had you all figured out, I'd still have you. What are you doing? What? Sleeping... in our bed. Oh wow. What? Wow. What? I've been out the joint two nights and a brotha can already sleep like a baby. You see why you foul? I'm tired. Talking about loving somebody, kill that noise. Oh man, I was awake the whole night when you left. The whole night. You probably went out clubbing with Cora. You answered the phone like I was calling about your Wi-Fi bill. Nate? Your mother says hi. Oh shit. Oh shit. Now who's foul? I'm meeting her for dinner on Wednesday. You know she really blames you for messing this up. Shit you tell her to get her ass in line then. Hate you. You so wish you did. How's your new place? It's nice, I like it. I gotta get used to it, though, you know. It was kind of scary last night. Weird new noises, the bed was cold. I knew I was just a bed warmer. I'm wearing those thick socks you like. Okay, now I only like those socks when you wear nothin' but a T-shirt with them, the effect gets lost when you put on those bulky pajamas of yours. So which one was it? The T-shirt or the bulky pajamas? Wouldn't you like to know? - I'd like to know what you're wearing now. I'm definitely not telling you that. - It's the T-shirt. - Shut up. It's the T-shirt and those flannel short shorts, got your legs out, oh snap! It is not it's the gray baggy sweatpants. Stop lying you wear those sweatpants on laundry day or if it's cold out or you're gonna take the garbage out to front, but don't mess with me, that's not no bed shit. You got on those flannel boxers right now. You're impossible. - I left my sneakers. - You left your sneakers here. I mean I could just put them in the mail for you. I'm not giving you my address. Okay fine. I could come pick them up. I don't have to stay long. No no no you can just duck in and out. Yeah. - I mean unless you wanted to get lunch or something like that. Oh yeah. Would you want to get lunch? That or you know I could just meet you somewhere with the kicks? Oh no no no, don't go out of your way. - I can come over. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Do you want to I don't know, like tomorrow at noon? - Yeah, that works. - All right. Okay.
