Ayako, hurry up. Stop! I'm not a burglar. Takako? - Long time no see. - Why... "Tokorozawa Premium Outlet New Year's Sale" "Tokorozawa Outlet Mall Project Outline" "Timeless Porn Stars" Miho. Let's discuss it some other time. But Kenta... Don't you want any children? Sure I do. We have separate bedrooms because I come home so late from work. I'm turning 35 next month. I know that. I'm happy living together with you like this. Isn't it hot? I'll turn on the air conditioner. When will it get cooler again? Right? Soon enough, I'm sure. We didn't go anywhere this summer again. We'll be discussing the same thing here again next year and the year after that. Just the two of us. Don't get upset. Come here, Fluffy. Come here, Fluffy. Here, for you. Are you married? Why? Because the girl... What about her father? It doesn't matter. Of course it matters! Takako! We broke up before she was born. You were gone for 10 years. What were you doing? - Working. - Doing what? I'm going to bed. Ayako, right? Come here where it's warm. Ayako. Oh, it's so cold. Your hands are freezing. "From Nakamura" "About your mom. Don't dwell on it." This is your mom when she was a baby. She's about your age in this one. Is he her dad? No, it's someone who used to help me out. Where's her dad? There is no dad in this family. Same as me? Oh, did you draw this? You're such a good artist. I'll buy you crayons tomorrow. Do me... Do me from behind. The shape of your finger... It's weird. This finger looks exactly like my dad's. Really? I'm the only ugly one among my siblings. My mom is pretty, too. Maybe you were conceived from an affair. I just told you my finger looks like my dad's. Oh, then you must have been a mutation. Men are... tired of looking at pretty women who all look the same. Look at the camera. No. You can always quit if you don't like it. You're not happy with your current life, are you? I'll think about it. Great! Call me, then. You'll belong to everyone from now on. Don't worry. "Job Application: Do you have a partner?" Everyone feels uneasy at first. "Do you like sex? Do you masturbate?" If I fill this out, will I automatically be registered as an actress? People applying for this job have various motives and reasons, so it's natural to feel awkward. Yes. I'm coming! Cut! OK! Good work. Thanks. - Thanks. - Good work. - Hope it didn't hurt. - No. I'm fine. I've got a steel vagina. Ms. Hashiguchi. Yes. This way. Please stand there and take off your clothes. There's another actress who looks out from there like you were doing. The view from the roof is better so she's often up there. She's from Hokkaido, and says the buildings look like dead trees in the wetlands. I can't give you any lasting reassurance no matter what I say. You must have a lot on your mind. The best way is to go on set and have everyone see your attractiveness. I'm coming! Cut! OK! Was it all right? Yes. Thank you. Someone's phone is ringing! Is it yours? Please make sure you turn it off. You should hurry. Hello? Are you doing something you can't tell me about? Some kind of unspeakable job? Someone told me. Hello? Ayano? Hello? Are you listening? Hello? "The Lowlife" Here. - Is this yours? - Yes. Whoa, it's too strong. Sure I have bad eyes. I have a grown granddaughter. She looks a lot like you when you were younger. Me? Not Takako? Well, does it matter either way? Welcome. Takako. Do you want something to eat? No thanks. Ayako. You've been drawing again? Let go of me. I'm so bored. Mr. Aoki been winning any bets? Yeah. - What? - You look younger. - What? - I can't see clearly with these. Hey! Let me borrow it! - Hello. - Hello. Sorry I'm late. Thanks, Misa. Hey, you look prettier. Has he been like this? The morphine kicked in and he isn't responding to anything. He doesn't respond even if I talk to him. Dad, it's Misa. Dad. Oh, look! He knows that I'm here! You shouldn't be using that here. Sorry. One of our actresses cancelled because of illness. What do you mean? I know it's sudden so feel free to say no, but... the director saw your photo and said he really liked you. "Mom: 8 Voice Mail, 24 Missed Call" He looks like an old man I don't know. What a thing to say. Remember when we were playing in Dad's study and found that DVD? The porn DVD. After Mom died and we finally began to get used to her not being around. You think Dad masturbated while watching it? Don't say such things. But he did his best to cook all of our meals back then. Spicy cod roe as a side dish every day. Side dish? Don't make me imagine Dad masturbating. He had trouble sewing those cushion covers that we had to donate for the school fundraisers, and worked on them all night. We'd all sit on the sofa together and watch TV. He let you do whatever you wanted but I wore that boring uniform for years. He enrolled you in that private school because it gave you an advantage when applying to art schools. Right, Dad? You know you've always been oriented towards stability. Your way of life, your clothes, even the guys you went out with. Unlike me, you've never caused problems for Dad. So all things considered, everything about you is average. You could have been perfect if you'd made him a grandpa. I'm not saying it's wrong. When all is said and done, that's how we make parents happy. Tomorrow... I can't come tomorrow. I have an appointment. Excuse me. This is your first time here, right? Oh, yes. Welcome. The usual? I think I'll have a beer. Sure. Hey? No way. No way. Oh man, my phone. Did you lose it? I was charging it and forgot about it. Oh no... Oh well. Hey. Here. Thanks. Sorry. I should close this. My bag's wide open, too. Drink more. I don't know. Thanks, thanks. Hey, there's less. Isn't this thin? You must have diluted it. Thanks for waiting. Cheers! Cheers! How many times have we done this? Itaru Hibino? Oh, I have my name cards! I'm an editor at a magazine specializing in the occult. The occult? No interest, huh? Well, it's scary stuff, right? It's not scary, but... Oh no. I feel like talking about this whenever I get drunk. About what? My boss... the editor-in-chief. She and I don't get along very well. She's beautiful by anybody's standard. And she does enjoy advantages in the business because of her looks, but... - But? - She's awful. Where are you going? To pee. I see. Ayako! Ayako, are you up? "Saturday morning" - Morning. - Morning. Hurry or you'll be late. Fluffy hasn't eaten anything since yesterday. It's only natural. A 12-year-old cat is 64 years old in human years. How do you know such things? Let's eat. You're done already? Yeah. Thanks. Don't forget your lunch. I don't think she left for good. Huh? Yeah. You're back! Give me some water. For pete's sake... Ayako, your lunch. - Here. - Thanks. See you. - Have a nice day. - See you. Morning. Morning. Are you going somewhere? What? I told you last night. I'm staying overnight at a hot spring in Mishima with Kazuko. Mishima? You mean in Shizuoka? My sister's here and so is Norio, so... I see. I made some curry for your dinner and breakfast. OK. See you, then. You must be stressed from caring for your dad, Huh? So enjoy yourself for a change. Maybe I won't go after all. Why? Go on. See you. Good morning. Good morning. Are you OK? Just barely. May I have some water? Sorry, but I don't remember. Did we do it? Oh, well, I don't remember either. - Oh, I see. - Here. Thank you. I don't remember, but... I'm wearing my pajamas and took off my makeup. These things happen to me a lot, actually. Just the other day I got drunk and took a bath with my clothes on, then stripped down to my underwear and fell asleep like that. Oh, but nothing like this. I mean, waking up to a guy sleeping next to me in the morning. Oh, it's just that I hadn't I passed out from being drunk like this in a while. Because I usually drink by myself. I do remember I had a lot of fun last night. I have a headache. You OK? This reminds me of my place back in university. Built 30 years ago. Rent's 50,000 yen. Paper-thin walls. You think we kept it down? Our voices. No idea. There she is in the photo. I never knew she painted. First time in 13 years. Isn't that amazing? Look. Look. You're awesome! Why didn't you tell us? Congratulations! You're amazing! Huh? Did you see that? Don't ignore us! Honma? She thinks she's so great. We should hurry! Who does she think she is? "Congratulations to Ayako Honma" "for winning an art award in France!" Well, I'll go to my office now. You're working on a Saturday? I forgot my cell phone. Oh, right. Oh man, I'm sure I've got so many missed calls and texts. What a drag. Bye. Hey, wait a sec. I have some shopping and stuff to do. - Can I go with you? - Sure. This way. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Here she is. Nice to meet you. Let's get to work. Ms. Hashiguchi I have to go somewhere else today. I have to do this by myself? Sorry. I know it's your first time. But we have three shoots scheduled today and only a few managers. I'll come pick you up tomorrow at noon. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to call. You'll be fine. I'll introduce you to everyone. Good morning. Why won't you answer my calls? You have some explaining to do. What's there to explain? Tell me what's going on so that I can understand. You wouldn't understand anyway. Do you think it's OK to do such things behind my back? No, I don't. Even if you go by a different name. People can still recognize you. It's not exactly a secret. You show everything. Your face, your naked body... Obscene. Stop it. Sayaka, you saw? I'm too embarrassed to go to university. A friend, huh? Or your boyfriend? Who cares? We came all the way from Kushiro because we were worried about you! All right. Be quiet. The neighbors can hear everything out here. Come inside. Come on. Are you in debt? No. What about school? Haven't been going. Oh, I'll pay you back my tuition and living expenses. What will you do from now on? Huh? You've basically thrown your life away. That's a bit dramatic. Are you being deceived? What? Be honest with me if you're being deceived. I'll help you out. OK? Tell me! Mom you said we were going to discuss this calmly. I have to go to work. Hey. Quit. Quit doing such work! No. You don't have to go. I do. Hey. I don't mind you hitting me, but my face is a tool of my livelihood. Wake up. You didn't come to Tokyo to do such things, did you? What do you want to be? I've already become what I want to be for the time being. What? I don't get you at all. You've always been like this. What were you thinking? Of all my children, you were the only one who rarely smiled. I could never tell what you were thinking at all. I won't be back for a while. Don't go. No. Don't go. No. Please. Take better care of yourself. Please. Hey, take a look at this. Honma? The one in our class? Run an image search. You really shouldn't do that. A porn star? This is awesome. This is awesome. A porn star? Honma, is your mother a... Stop it. "Honma's mother is a porn star." Honma? Honma? Honma? Honma? Anemia? Someone go get a teacher. Honma? Hey. Honma, are you all right? Are you OK? Yes. The nurse said you're anemic and that it's nothing serious. Shall I get her? I'm fine. Honma. I know this might not be the right time, but you're the only one who hasn't submitted the counseling form. Are you considering a university of fine arts or an art school? I don't know. What does your mother think? It doesn't matter what she thinks. Excuse me. Ms. Hashiguchi, you're on. She's here. Let's get started. Over there. We'll start from the bathing scene. Mother. Good work. You too. This is your first time, isn't it? You were amazing. It didn't seem like that at all. Really? Did you get any sleep last night? Do I have bags under my eyes? Oh, today's makeup artist is really good at her job. Just that I remembered how I couldn't sleep at all before my first sex scene. It wasn't such a big deal after all. Hello. Hello. You hear stuff like, "You should only have sex with someone you love." But nobody is that pure no matter how you try to gloss over it. This is work. Work should be done efficiently and enjoyably. You're right. I think you'll succeed in this line of work. I hope we work together again in the future. To tell you the truth, you're really my type. Honma, finally! What took you so long? Honma. Hey, Honma. So you like to paint, huh? Yeah. You do seem artsy. Artsy? Isn't she? Kind of moody and all. Don't say that. Who's your favorite artist? Zdzislaw Beksinski. Huh? That was long. Who did you say? Who is that? Say it again. Zdzislaw Beksinski. Never heard of that. Oh, is that true? About that text that's going around. Haven't you seen it? Have you seen it? - I haven't seen it. - Really? It said something about how Honma's father is a porn star. A porn star? Yeah. And her mom gave birth and couldn't act in blue movies anymore so she ran out of money and came home. Gross, huh? Let's go. That's sick, I can't believe it. You OK? You're laughing at me, aren't you? Sending me weird texts and acting like a stalker. Tell me! That's what this is about, right? Hey, I'm sorry. Happy now? Go to hell! She's here. Hello. Hi. So we meet again. This must be fate. Yeah. Nice to see you. I'm counting on your steel vagina again. We're starting so get ready. Yes. Ow! It's OK. Relax. What are you doing? I thought you were leaving again. I was about to but I used up all my money on pachinko so I can't go anymore. Give me a ride. I wish I could go somewhere. There you are, Ms. Hashiguchi. We're starting again. Sorry. I wanted to get some fresh air. Let's go. Aren't you ever going to work again? What's the point of working part-time at a supermarket or something? Your grandma is still able to work. Being dependent isn't bad. Mom. Were you a porn star? You knew? Until right before you were born. I used to do stuff like that. Do you hate me even more now? Is it true that my dad was a male porn star? Who says such things? That you got pregnant from a shoot and came home because you ran out of money. You're lucky, Ayako. You're a good artist. Receiving awards, even. I didn't have anything. I'm starving. Let's go to Mom's place and ask her to make us something good to eat. Come on, hurry. Turn around. Is Mr. Goto's family here? - Misa! - Please come to his room. We're turning. Coming through. Is mine bigger than Dad's? Is it better than Dad's? I'm coming. Good work. Sorry. "Saturday night" - See you. - Yeah. Hey, she reminds me of Takako when she was in high school. Pretty hot. Oh, sorry. See you. Thanks for coming. Ayako, you should button up your shirt. I'm hot. I rode my bicycle. A clean look is important in this business. You know that. What's wrong? Why are you silent all of a sudden? Grandma, are you... What? Are you jealous of me? Because I'm the daughter of your young, pretty, trashy daughter. What are you saying? I know, Grandma. You're really jealous of Mom because you gave up being a woman but she didn't. You think you should have neglected that no-good daughter to live your own life. I don't regret a thing. I was really happy, giving birth to her and raising her. It's true that before I had a child, there were times that I wondered what was so great about living. I used to be like you when I was around your age. Thinking that I was the only unhappy person. Always miserable. Feeling like I couldn't break loose from a nebulous place. But... I realized after giving birth to a child. No matter how much I think about the meaning of life I'll never discover it. I just live one day at a time, and grow older as my child grows up. That's all there is to it. When she came back from Tokyo I thought, "How can she be so selfish?" But I understood when I learned that you were five. She wanted to put you in a school here and raise you properly. "You'll understand when you grow up." "You have to be a parent to understand." That's all you and Mom ever say. Ayako. Hello? Yes, I heard. Are you all right? They said they have enough footage, so please don't worry about it. I'm very sorry for your loss. Please call me again when you feel better. Yes. Did someone die? You should take better care of yourself. Go in for a checkup sometime. It's just exhaustion and anemia. That's serious enough. You should never let yourself collapse on the set as an actress. There really isn't anything we shouldn't let ourselves do, is there? We're very sorry for your loss. Miho. Miho. Are you OK? Dad helped us out. He specified everything from who to invite to his funeral to the gifts. It was like him to do that. We have to go buy mourning clothes. Want to wear Dad's? You're about the same size. Really? He looks serene. Miho. You be the chief mourner. You were with him a lot longer than I was. I think he'd be happier that way. You can handle it. I'd probably mess up the final speech. No, you wouldn't. Miho. I... Miho. I think I'm pregnant. Huh? A baby? I'm happy for you. Congratulations. You see, I found out I was pregnant on the day Dad fell into a coma. Maybe his spirit left his body and entered my womb. I see. But I can't. What's wrong? I'm... seeing someone else. This could be Dad reincarnated. He'd be so sad in heaven if I got an abortion. What the hell? Sorry, you're right to be mad at me at a time like this. Why am I always like this? I wish I could be proper like you. I'm not proper. Yes, you are. Too proper. No, I'm not! Kenta. Let's go get our mourning clothes. What, now? Yes, now. See you later. Men and women... At the first sight? Do you know that notion about being reborn as a human? You know how you meet different kinds of people in life? People with character, people who can get on in the world... Or people who call kill without qualms. That's determined by how many times they were reborn as human beings. So some weren't human beings in their previous life? Yeah. Leaves and bugs, even minerals. Some might have been cats. - I'll take this. - I'll put it on your check. Yeah. So for some, it might be their first time being human. And then if they reincarnate as human again, that's twice. How many times you've experienced being human determines your character. Interesting when you think about it that way. Mr. Hibino. If that's the case, it might be my first time being human. I'll go take a shower. We might not have any free time for a while. Kenta. Make love to me. What? Whoa, hey. What's wrong? I'm not who I was until yesterday. I can tell. You can? How? I mean you must be shaken about your father's death. The look on your face when you arrived wasn't normal. I could see that. Tomorrow's the wake. That's why. You get a day off work, and I have no housework. Stop it. This isn't like you. What am I like, then? Tell me! What am I? It's your smell. That's why I wanted to take a shower. What's wrong? I have a different fetish now. Masturbate for me. It really turns me on. Will you do it for me? I was having sex with another man in Mishima. That's why I couldn't be with Dad when he died. I was shooting porn. What are you saying? I don't get it. I was in a porn movie! I got naked in front of a camera and had sex with a guy I just met! - Are you OK? - No, I'm not OK! Do you think I'm OK? Sorry. You're not mad at me? I can't be mad at you. My mind is too full and I don't know what to think. Why aren't you mad at me? Hey, why aren't you mad at me? Thanks. I'll go home today. Yeah. See you, then. Hey! Um... Well, I wanted to say something meaningful, but... See you again. See you again. "Ayano, Take care of yourself." "Come home if it gets too hard." "Mother" Hello? Sayaka, where are you? Let me talk to Mom. She's not here. What? I took a plane. I'm back in Kushiro already. Mom said she's dropping by Aunt Masae's in Aomori. Taking an overnight bus. Mom! Here. "Come home if it gets too hard"? Writing down whatever you feel like. Of course I can never go home again! That's what I do for a living! That's... my... That's my job. You're freezing. I'm sorry. Let's go now. Let's talk things over after things have settled down. "Sunday morning" Coming! I'm sorry to bother you so early. I'm Takako Honma's daughter. Miho! Miho, come here! She's Takako Honma's daughter. My name is Ayako Honma. I came on behalf of my mother. Thank you. Please come in. Excuse me. Who is she? Never mind. Help me sort through Dad's things. I have to put something in his coffin. Kenta, lend us a hand. Yes. Please offer an incense stick. Oh, yes. Just once, he introduced me to your mother. I see. You weren't born yet. You were still in your mother's womb. Please look at his face. Don't hold a grudge against him. My mother is... a difficult person, so... That's probably why it didn't work out between them. That's not the reason. He had to think about us, too. She used to appear in porn movies. She even said that she had no interest in someone who wasn't alive anymore so she wouldn't come. That's the kind of person my mother is. Do you... draw pictures? Come with me. Father used to paint, too. Back when he was young. He used to say he regretted not being able to paint like that. He said this was one of his better ones. He loved this artist. He would show me these two books, sitting side by side on that sofa. He'd wanted to become an artist but couldn't, so he told me to go to art school. I couldn't live up to his expectations. I'm sorry. I love this painting, too. I don't know why my mother used to appear in porn movies. I don't know what to think about that man being my father, but... But... I do love this painting. I know that for certain! There was a fountain pen he said was a gift from Mom that was important to him. Look for it. Right. Kenta, move. Never mind, I'll look for it. I already checked there. - You're so useless. - It wasn't over here. I'm a bit tired. I feel like stretching out my legs. Mr. Hibino. Mr. Hibino, I...
