Ever since we parted in 1949, we have been separated by the Taiwan Strait for 30 years. Throughout the past decades, sorrow and grief have crept up whenever I think of you. At that time when I boarded the ship, I only knew that the troop was relocating. And I assumed we would meet again soon. Never did I expect that we would be kept apart for decades. What saddened me the most was that... you were already pregnant at the time. As his father, not only was I not by your side to take care of you, I wasn't even given the chance to hear his first cries. Upon reaching Taiwan, I tried ways and means to get in touch with you. After five years, I met a local woman, Suqin. She treated me well and we had a son from this marriage. Our son is now doing well in his business. Suqin passed away peacefully three years ago. I know that I don't have many days left. My greatest regret and guilt in this life... is my failure in my promise to you. - You should have another bowl of soup. - Okay. After such a long time, I had given up hope of ever coming back. I thought I'd be buried here. Never did I expect to be given the chance to return to the mainland. Now that my trip back is confirmed, reality seems to be setting in. My longing for you grows as the days go by. Hope to see you soon, Yansheng. He's coming back. It's good news after all. How can this be good news? You will know if it's indeed good news when he's actually back. Mom, I don't get it. Now that his Taiwanese wife has passed away, he's thought of coming back to you. So, what if his wife was still alive? He wouldn't have thought of coming to visit you then. You should ignore such a heartless person. Eldest brother, what do you say? This has nothing to do with me. I don't even know him. How can this have nothing to do with you? He is your father. I have no idea why this old fart is coming back now. Grandma. What's your plan now that this Taiwanese man is coming back? (Apart / Together) There's not enough oil. Oil costs money too. It'll taste better with more oil. You have prepared so many dishes. It looks better than a New Year's feast. Since he's coming from so far, we should show our hospitality. That's true. - What time did you arrange for him to come? - At three. 3:00pm... From what I know, the Taiwanese are very punctual. They will only be early and never late. He will be here all right. Don't you worry. Why are you feeding him again? The guest's not here yet. Wait for him. It's all right, he's just a kid. You are always singing a different tune to me. It's all right. I should do it. Liu Yansheng's visit does not concern only your family. I welcome him on behalf of the residents' committee and government. Our neighbors have been very helpful. Not only did they free up the communal kitchen, we have also arranged for a band. Hopefully, he can feel our hospitality. Under your leadership, everything's going to be great. The sausages are ready. He's here. The Taiwanese is here! Didn't I say that the Taiwanese would be early? Let's go. Dad, let's go. Mom, are you not coming with us? Are you Yu'er? I am Liu Yansheng. Everyone, I am Liu Yansheng. I have joined the Taiwan Veterans Home Returning Group... to come back to Shanghai. I am filled with emotions. I have waited very long for this day. I have waited for decades. Don't stand on ceremony. It's good that you are back. We have all been looking forward to your return. Yu'er, please say a few words. Let me introduce them to you. This is Lao Lu, Lu Shanmin. It's been hard on you. This is my second son-in-law, Li Qi. Uncle, we welcome you back. She's the head of our residents' committee, Chief Pan. Welcome, welcome. This is my granddaughter, Nana. - Hello, Grandpa. - Hello. This is my second daughter, Lu Xinhua. - Hello. - Enjoy yourself while you are here. This is Feifei. - Feifei, address Grandpa. - Hello, Grandpa. This is my eldest daughter, Lu Aihua. Hello. This is our son, Jianguo. Let's drink. I was away from home for decades... and have been to many places. But no matter how good it was, it can never compare to our hometown. Uncle, where are you putting up now? In the hotel. Why are you staying in a hotel? It's not easy for you to make the trip back. You should stay here at home. You have been away for so many years. You're finally back, and you are staying outside. That's as good as not coming back. I don't want to inconvenience you. Come on, Yu'er. Say something. It's no trouble at all. Do stay with us. Okay. Thank you. Right, there's nothing inconvenient. Today's a happy day. On behalf of the neighborhood and government, let me offer everyone a toast. Okay. Across the straits, we remain family, and blood is thicker than water. It's not easy for all of us to gather here. Come on, let's all toast. Right. Here, here. Let's wish all lovers... Let's wish reunions for all families, just like yours. Come on, let's eat. Uncle, these two are famous dishes in Shanghai. This is Songjiang Fish while this is steamed eel. - Mom prepared these especially for you. - They are Mom's specialties. They taste great. Mom woke up early to prepare these. Have more. Don't stand on ceremony, have more. It's prepared specially for you. Any plans while you are in Shanghai? The tour group has made arrangements for some sightseeing. Sounds good. Nana, you should accompany Uncle for the next two days. Take him to Chenghuang Temple and Zigzag Bridge. - The Oriental Pearl TV Tower. - Or go walk around the Pudong New Area. - Okay. - It's pretty there. Thank you. Have more. Let's eat. Help yourself. I am truly... grateful to you for allowing me... to stay in the house while I am here. Don't mention it. It's only right. You have been away for so long, and it's not easy for you to make the trip back. - Yu'er is making the bed for you outside. - Thank you. You should soak your feet later too. You'll feel more comfortable sleeping when your legs are warm. I don't have such a habit. Taiwan's weather is hot while it's cold here in Shanghai. I need a foot soak every day. - I can't fall asleep if I don't. - I see. The bed's ready. You should have left this kind of task to me. Don't stand on ceremony. Can you still remember the Shanghai dialect? I can understand it, but I can't converse in it any more. My house is small. I bought a new bed and blanket for you. I made the bed too. Thank you. There's draught here. Be careful and don't catch a cold at night. Thank you. You must be tired. Rest early. - Okay. - I'll leave you to it. Hello, friends of the Taiwan Home Returning Group. Welcome to Shanghai. Almost everyone who knows China has heard of Shanghai. Just like those who know of the United States of America will know New York. China is inseparable from Shanghai. In fact, China's economy started from Shanghai. Okay, let's all look to the left. Here's the Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone. These are all landmark buildings of Lujiazui. It's now a symbol of China's reform, opening up and economic growth. All right, let's all look to our right now. On our right, we can see the Jin Mao Tower. It's 88 stories and 420.5 meters tall. But these two buildings are not the tallest. Soon, an even taller building will appear before us and that's the Shanghai Tower. It'll be 623 meters tall. That's more than 100 meters taller than Taipei 101. Okay, we are now passing through the Lupu Bridge. It spans across 550 meters... and is known to be the world's longest arch bridge. With a rainbow-like appearance, it stretches across the Huangpu River. The gorgeous landscape... is beautiful enough to rival that of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. All right, let's look to the left now. What's speeding along here is the magnetic levitation train. It's the world's fastest city-to-city transport, with an operational speed of up to 430 km/h. - Both of you, press on! - Okay. Be careful and walk slowly. We're almost there! Another six months and... we can move into this house. It's more than 70 square meters and cost us more than RMB1 million. If it was just our pension alone, there's no way that Lao Lu and I... could have bought this house. Luckily, we had relocation compensation from our old house, and the kids chipped in as well. So, that's how we got this house. We can't stay in our old house any longer. They are redeveloping the area. I had a house like this in Taiwan too. It had three bedrooms and a living room. It was small but it had a sea view. We are getting old. Every few floors we have to rest. Right, time and tide wait for no man. Since coming back, I haven't had a chance to have a heart-to-heart talk with you. - We're here. - Okay. This house looks great. The developer got a piece of land... and dreams of putting every Shanghainese into it. All the developers are the same. You can see the river from here. This alone is worth more than RMB20,000. I didn't expect you to have an eye for investment. In the future, there's going to be a wall here. The second phase development will be right outside here. They are building lots of houses. Grandma, I need to go to the ladies room. The pier where we retreated back then, it seems like it's nearby. Everything else aside, all I want to know is... The day when the troop pulled out, you told me to meet you at Huangpu River... so that we could leave together. But I couldn't find you. And since the day you left, I have never heard from you. What exactly happened? Yu'er, there are some heartfelt words which I'm not sure if I should be saying. The reason I am here is to take you back to Taiwan with me. Are you willing? In the early days, I listened to you and married you. But you left and were gone for decades. You are back now, but I'm married to Lao Lu now. I have children with him too. How do you expect me to face them? Jianguo is very cold toward me. I know it's not going to be easy... for him to acknowledge me as his father. The kids have grown up, and they have their own world. What I want to know is, are you getting along well with Brother Lu? For the past decades, I am just living out the days. Not only was I the wife of a Kuomintang member, I had a kid with me too. To be able to survive to this day is already a gift. During the Cultural Revolution, I almost wanted to drown myself in the river. Lao Lu brought Jianhua along to search for me. At that time, I was already pregnant with Lao Lu's child. Don't cry. When we were guarding Kinmen, all of us yearned to go home. But army deserters were shot dead. The only way out was to jump into the sea and swim back. There were many who jumped into the sea, but none managed to swim back. During the Cultural Revolution, I thought of you whenever I couldn't hang on any further. I would remember our good days together. It was only during those good days... that I truly lived. I'll call you back later. Is going abroad more important than me? Am I nobody to you? Dream on! Why should I wait for you? Who do you think you are? Stop dreaming and get lost! In Taiwan, there's a place called Hualien. I am thinking of buying a bigger house there. You have sea views the moment you step out of the house. It's not cold in the winter and not hot during summer. We are getting old, and our days are numbered, right? But the issue is Lao Lu. He is a good person. He suffered a lot too during the Cultural Revolution. I cannot let him down. Right. Don't worry. I will do my best to make it up to Brother Lu, okay? Actually, he is aware that... you would bring up this matter sooner or later. Let's discuss how we should break the news to him. Okay? Why don't I talk to him first? Okay. - Done with your marketing? - I have to buy two crabs. Lao Lu, you have a guest at home? Goodbye. - Morning. Done with marketing? - I have to buy two crabs. Boss, I want to buy two crabs. - How much is this? - Forty. - How about this? - This cost fifty. - And this? - This is one hundred each. If you are treating a guest, this will be good. Okay, I will take four then. You have a Taiwanese guest at home. - Four hundred. - Take care and bye. I have bought the ingredients. Why are you back so late? Stop working. I have something to say to you. Look at these big crabs. It cost a hundred each and I bought four. Are you crazy? Why did you buy such big crabs? Big crabs don't necessarily taste better. When eating crabs, we should go for the bigger ones. Only the poor would say that big crabs don't taste good. The poor couldn't afford it but you can. So, you are rich? No. Since we are eating it ourselves, the size doesn't matter. - Anyway, we are giving a treat. - The guest is not an emperor. After the meal, our lives still continue. Such expensive crabs. Even if an emperor was here, I wouldn't treat him to any. Liu Yansheng has been away for so long and... it's not easy for him to make the trip back. Why don't I go and return two of these? Both of you can have one each. It's been so many years since the two of you last saw each other. Come back here. - We should all eat them together. - Right. So, that's the reason you asked me to boil the water. Put them in. Cover it. Press it down! These crabs are strong. It pinched me just now and I had a hard time shaking it off. What did you want to say to me just now? All this commotion, now I forgot what I wanted to say. Go and put a bandage on your wound. - Hello. - Hello. Welcome. - Boss. - Hello. I am the Taiwanese who came by previously. I brought an old friend with me today. Can we have a look again? Sure. Doors to all our rooms are left opened. Thank you. - Be careful when going up the stairs. - Okay. Be careful. I have been here a couple of times, and I have asked around. They said it's this motel. Shanghai has changed a lot. Over here. Be careful. At this point, are your memories coming back? It's this room. For the first time back then, you met me here behind your family's back. Your whole family didn't approve of me then. Because I was just a mere soldier with no future. Thinking back, my family was right after all. Right? I'll make it up to you. I thought I wouldn't have a problem bringing up the matter to Lao Lu. But I'm finding it increasingly difficult to break the news to him. Especially that day when he bought those huge crabs for you. You have no idea... how thrifty he is normally. He is always reluctant to spend on himself, but that day, he bought such big crabs for you. Look at how warm and kind he is. At that moment, I just couldn't bring myself to break the news to him. You've been with Brother Lu for so many years, I am aware of his importance to you. I am just a soldier with limited resources. All I have is my pension and some savings. I initially planned to give him the bulk of it. But on second thought, I think I should give him all. Other than showing my gratitude, it will also put us at ease when we are together. Right. He has treated me well all these years. Lao Lu is such a good person. All the more I can't bring myself to hurt him. How about this? Since you used to be eloquent, you can have a word with him. Sure. Maybe this will be better. It's just that for the longest time, I haven't really been talking much. So, what should we do? Shall we both talk to him then? Have faith in me. No matter how we bring it across to Brother Lu, I think it will be far trickier than the negotiations between... the Kuomintang and the Communist Party back then. Lao Liu, do you still remember? When we were here before, there used to be a guy singing by the window, and we sang along with him. Do you recall? Have more. You too. - You should eat more. - I am full. Try to eat more if you can. I have always had a good appetite. Lao Lu's appetite has always been good. It's been so since the days he was in the army and when he was a worker. Well, before doing anything, we must be well-fed to have strength. Right? Right, it applies to all soldiers. Here. Brother, regarding that matter, I would like to hear your views. Regarding this matter, Yu'er's view... is the most important. Yu'er's view is the same as what I told you just now. - So, both of you have discussed and agreed? - Yes. It's settled then. Thank you. Brother, I am grateful to you... for taking care of Yu'er for the past decades. Please rest assured that... I will do my utmost to compensate you. With regard to compensation... I am already so old. Why would I need so much money? You can rest assured that I am fine with this. Thank you. You will have to discuss it with the kids. Listen to their views as well. Lao Lu is right. We have to discuss it with the kids too. Of course. Of course we should discuss this with all the kids. No matter what... Brother... Yu'er... You will forever be our elder brother. Okay. Drink up. I like to drink whenever I am happy. Yu'er, get me more rice. Outside the pavilion, beside the ancient path, the green lawn stretches into the blue sky. The night breeze brushes the willows and the sound of flute trails. Sunset behind the silhouette of mountains. At the furthest end of the sky, at the remotest corner of the earth, my friends are scattered there. This last pot of wine ends my happiness. Tonight, I am left with a cold parting dream. Outside the pavilion, beside the ancient path, the green lawn stretches into the blue sky. The night breeze brushes the willows and the sound of flute trails. Sunset behind the silhouette of mountains. At the furthest end of the sky, at the remotest corner of the earth, my friends are scattered there. This last pot of wine ends my happiness. Tonight, I am left with a cold parting dream. Why isn't anyone speaking up? Now that things have come this far, all of you are acting like this? Since none of you wants to speak up, I will do it then. Uncle Liu, out of respect, I am addressing you as uncle. It's good that you've come from Taiwan to visit Shanghai. You walked around and visited many places. Shanghai has changed a lot. Didn't you enjoy the trip? It's fine that you stayed in our house and ate with us. But surely, you can't be serious about taking my mother away. What's going to happen to my dad? You have gone too far! Sis, calm down. Mom must have her own thoughts. What thoughts could she have? Mom, tell us what's on your mind. I have been with your father for decades. There's gratitude and kindness. I was with your Uncle Liu for only a year. There are feelings. For the past decades, I have lived for this family. I have lived for my children. At this age, I want to live for myself... and be true to my feelings... for my remaining years. - It's all my fault. - Shut up! Brother, you should speak up too. This has nothing to do with me. How could this have nothing to do with you? It concerns you the most. You must be hoping for it! I am warning you. Stop spewing nonsense. In what way am I spewing nonsense? Dad, your efforts in bringing him up have all been wasted. He has no conscience at all. You are crazy. I have nothing to say. Brother, you shouldn't behave like this. Since you were young, our family has treated you well. Whenever there's any good stuff, you always get it first. When elder sis got married, she had neither money nor house. And where's the money? It's all been loaned to him. If you are that great, then stop taking money from the family. And stop losing all the money too. I will return you the money. I am sick of your empty promises. That's enough. Stop quarrelling. I am getting giddy from your bickering. Dad, Mom, rightfully, as a son-in-law, I don't have any right to talk. But I would like to express my views. Dad, what are you doing? Mom, by leaving with him like this, I don't think you are being fair to Dad. I am a businessman. When doing business, we have to be clear in our approach. For no apparent reason, you are just leaving with him, and he doesn't seem to be accounting for it. Dad obviously has the shorter end of the stick. Everyone, please allow me to speak. Before coming back, I thought this through very carefully. And I have brought with me RMB100,000. RMB100,000? That's barely enough to buy a toilet in the Qingpu district, Zhujiajiao Town. (foreign language) I am telling you guys that it's all up to you. This person has nothing to do with me. Whatever my mom wants to do, I will not interfere. Don't put pm an act when it's money that you guys want. This has nothing to do with money! I will be frank. We are a family. No way will we agree to Mom leaving us. How can this have nothing to do with money? You are so vulgar. It's always money with you. It's our family's matter, so just keep your views to yourself. Bullcrap, scatterbrain! Since when was I not involved in your family matters? - Now, you are offering lip service. - Are you trying to scare me? - So what if I am? - So what if you don't agree with me? It's all because you have a mistress outside. - Stop quarrelling! - Dad, stop it. If this is the case, let's divorce. I agree, so let's get divorced. Dad, you are muddle-headed. It's you guys who are muddle-headed. I know what your concerns are. You are afraid of losing face in front of others in the future. Your mom has worked hard all her life. Now that she has this opportunity, we should fulfil her wish. Why must she continue suffering with me? At my age, how many more years do I have? Why should I receive so much money from others? It's fine so long as your mom is happy. This is between the two of us. You guys shouldn't interfere. Just go for now. I don't want to listen any further. Especially you. You are the first who should get lost now! Don't ever regret what you said. Don't leave. You are the one leaving, not me. Nana, go after your aunt and stop her from leaving. Auntie, don't leave. Lao Lu, you are all dressed up today. Going for matchmaking? I have got all your documents here. Identification cards, household register... except your marriage certificate. How can you apply for a divorce when you don't have a marriage certificate? This is tricky. Why is that so? We did not apply for a marriage certificate back then... because those were exceptional times. We held a wedding, and lots of our relatives attended it. It was rather common at that time. So, what's the issue? Yours is a de facto marriage. Right, ours is a de facto marriage. Divorce is not required for de facto marriages. You must have a marriage certificate to apply for divorce. Please help. We are in a hurry. It's not up to me to help. We have to follow the law and regulations. So, what should we do? We must be divorced by today. Please help to think of a way. I am sure you can do something about it. It's not that easy. By rights, you should first take a wedding photo over there. Then, go next door to apply for a marriage certificate. With that marriage certificate, you can come back here to apply for a divorce. That idea sounds great. He is suggesting that we take a wedding photo over there, and then apply for a marriage certificate. Once we have the marriage certificate, we can come here again to apply for a divorce. So, let's just get married first. Okay. Marriage is a happy occasion. When having your picture taken, think of the happy memories. Be natural, come closer and look here. Okay, let's begin. One, two... Okay. Next, please. Marriage is a happy occasion. Both of you should smile and sit closer. Look here. That's it. Smile. Good. One, two... At your age and for a twilight romance, it's not easy for you guys to come to me to take this photo. When taking pictures, be natural and look happy. And the pictures will turn out well. I specialize in wedding photos, so rest assured. When taking pictures, don't look down. Eyes that are gazing downward emit a sad feeling. Eyes should gaze upward. And you'll look more natural too. Pictures like this turn out better. Look at me. I will demonstrate. Got it? That's what you should do. Gaze upwards. Get closer. Tilt your head. Smile. That's right. One, two... Welcome to the Oriental Pearl TV Tower. The Oriental Pearl TV Tower is 468 meters tall. It's the second tallest in Asia and fourth tallest in the world. You can enjoy the lovely view of Shanghai on the 360-degree observation deck. Can you see the white building over there? It's the tall building beside the river. Grandma used to live there. Can you recall? That one. Look over here. Those low-rise, red houses in front. There... That's where we live now. Can you see those high-rise buildings with gold roofs? - Can you see them? - Yes. My grandparents are applying for a divorce there right now. A twilight romance is rare and precious. Later, take this wedding certificate to the Financial Affairs Office... to submit a RMB100 administrative fee. This booklet is for you. And this is for you. Congratulations. We're applying for divorce right after this. In that case, I congratulate you on that too. Your marriage certificate is in order. But you did not stipulate clearly... the division of your marital assets in your divorce application. These include all your deposits and properties. Did you bring along your property certificates? The property's under construction now and we don't have the certificate yet. Property is an important asset. You must write it down very clearly or else, there'll be lots of issues later. This concerns not only just the two of you but your children as well. You should exercise caution over this. - Can we split it in half? - Right, can we? Even if it's to be split in half, the property certificate has to be submitted. We can proceed only after the written agreement is done. So, we have wasted our entire day today? Not really. Legally speaking, both of you are now officially married. Do you like Shanghai? The Shanghai of today is too foreign to me. Stop fretting. I took you out to enjoy yourself. Grandma and you will get to be together. This yellow rice wine is not authentic. It has no kick at all. - Let's go for baijiu then. - Sure. You are treating us today, right? Regardless if it's marriage or divorce, both are serious matters. So, should we change to baijiu then? Yes, we should. - Waitress, give us a baijiu. - Be quick and serve us the baijiu. - Is this baijiu okay for you? - Shall we take this? It's RMB180. - Bring us two glasses. - Okay. Having gone through these past few days, I have changed my outlook on life. I used to be very thrifty... for the good of everybody. And I thought this was a virtue. But now I have sorted out my thinking. I should learn to enjoy. Right, you should enjoy yourself. Here. Cigarettes, cigarettes... - Nana. - Give it to him. I don't smoke. You don't smoke? I know you do. Come on. Your grandpa needs a puff so light up one for me. So, you really do have cigarettes with you. When did you start smoking? - Let her be, so long as she's happy. - I smoke for the fun of it. - What fun? You are a young lady. - Light it up. This is an exception. I won't allow it again. She's picking up bad habits from you. I used to smoke. But I quit, so I could save money. - Smoking is an enjoyment too, right? - Right. Never did I expect... my first ever wedding photo to be taken to facilitate my divorce. Isn't this ridiculous? Brother Lu, have a drink with me. Do me this favor. I have been doing you lots of favors. All my life, I have been considerate for others. But what happened in the end? I am the one who suffered, right? Now, I'll enjoy life and be merry. - Come on. Let's be merry. - Let's be merry. I have always been merry and enjoyed life. Look at you. During the liberation of Shanghai, I was a deputy commander in the army. My career looked promising... and everything was going well. But what happened in the end? Your mom was alone with a kid. She was so pitiful. At that time, everyone was advising me... not to marry her. Because she's the ex-wife of a Kuomintang member. Some of my ex-comrades became battalion commanders, while some became regimental commanders. There's one who became a platoon sergeant. - Any idea what he became subsequently? - What? - Assistant Division Commander! - He's good. And what about me? All my life, I was just a welder in a shipyard. When I retired, your son wanted to take over my position. The boss refused. He said we had political issues. Tell me, does that make any sense? Of course it doesn't. During the Cultural Revolution, one moment, they would be accusing me of harboring rebels. And the next, they were accusing me of colluding with enemies. Right? Do you know what? On a midsummer's night that year, Mr Chen from the Workers' Propaganda Team brought along 5 or 6 people to capture me. My second daughter was just born then. The kid was crying so pitifully. Poor thing. Stop blabbering. Drink up and eat some food. My entire lifetime... Firstly, I have no money. Secondly, I am not capable. And I've never understood what love is all about. Yu'er, you said there's no love between us and I can accept that. I wanted to give you what you wanted, if that made you happy. But I just can't figure it out. Do the years we spent together mean nothing at all? - Deep in my heart, I feel it's so... - Unfair! Don't interrupt when the adults are talking. - Did I say anything wrong? - Keep quiet! Please lower your voice. Be considerate. What do you mean by saying I am not considerate? What is this old fart talking about. Sit down! What do you want? - I am not afraid of death, let alone you. - What are you trying to do? Dad, Dad... I am warning you. You will be held responsible for this. (foreign language) (foreign language) He's suffering from a mild cerebral infarction. You should let him rest. And he must not be agitated again. Please take note. I knew this was going to happen. What you guys are doing is killing my dad. Please stop. Sister Qiu, you're preparing dinner. Is Lao Lu feeling better now? Yes, he is. Thanks for your concern. The porridge is ready. I will feed him. Lao Lu, have some porridge. Porridge is easily digestible. Your stomach will feel better. But I have no appetite. You have not eaten for two days. You must eat something. My brother, don't you have a huge appetite? You'll gain strength only when you are full. I'm not refusing to eat, I'm just not hungry. Even if you are not hungry, try to have some. You can't be going without food for two days. Just have some. My brother, stroke is not a major illness. All elderly people will suffer from minor strokes. Come on, eat some. A stroke is caused by some hardened arteries. My arteries have been hardened for the longest time. Don't worry. There's lots of good medicine in Taiwan. Once I am back there, I will find some and send it to you. You have to press on, my brother. We are ex-soldiers. I beg of you, Yansheng. Just take a few bites. Okay? Here. Lao Lu is a good person. He never loses his temper. It's all because of me that he lost his temper that day. What's going to happen to him now that he has this illness? Don't worry. Whether this illness can be controlled depends on the body condition. Body condition can be improved with more nutrients. I will go to the market tomorrow to get him some supplements. The supplements are not going to help. The doctor has already said that... a patient with cerebral hemorrhage must not be agitated. We are the ones who caused him to be so agitated. I need to get some fish and other seafood. Get it from the stall in front. It's here. - This stall? - Further up. Hello, we want to buy something. This is good. It's a turtle. Is it from the wild? No, it's reared. - Do you have crabs caught from the wild? - No, I don't. Do you have abalone then? Sorry, I don't. You can try finding those at Tongchuan Road. The market at Tongchuan Road is bigger and has more variety. What a headache. Tongchuan Road... Do you know Tongchuan Road? Of course I do. It's very far. It can't be further than Taiwan. Take me there. Come on. Nana, sorry to keep you waiting. Did you manage to get everything? Yes, this market is good. It's big and you can find almost anything. There's lots of seafood varieties and most are caught from the wild. This is Grandma's address. I need to leave now to attend to an urgent matter in my shop. You have to hail a cab and get home yourself, okay? I have to go back now to cook too. All right, then. My number is here. If you really can't find your way back, give me a call. Okay. - Don't get lost. - I won't. Take care. I have prepared this Buddha Jump Over The Wall for Lao Lu. It's the king of all soups. All the most delicious ingredients you could possibly find on earth... are inside this pot. Those flying in the sky, those running on the ground, and those swimming in the waters. All the goodnesses are here. Knowing that you've bought all this good stuffs for him, Lao Lu insisted that he wants to drink. He dug out the wine that he's kept for decades. Lao Lu is a person with sense. Of course he's aware a good dish should be complemented by a good wine. I am worried. Last time when he had the stroke, he was drinking too. Now that he has recovered slightly, he's drinking again. What should we do about it? Your family's Lao Lu... I have come to understand him really well. His body condition is good. Better than mine. Don't worry. I will drink more later. When you were with me long ago, you didn't know how to do anything. You are doing great now. My Taiwanese wife taught me how to cook this "Buddha Jump Over the Wall". If she sees from heaven... that I am cooking such nice food for you, she's going to hate me. She was a very jealous woman. Lao Liu, I have to be frank with you. I understand. Don't say it now. Wait until we are done with the good food and excellent wine. It's not too late for you to say it then. Here, let's cheers. Drink up. Excellent. It has the flavor of the homeland. This wine is very common. It's not expensive, but I have kept it for 20 years. It's the aging time that's precious. Yu'er, fill up our glasses. Don't drink so much. It's all right. (foreign language) You can eat less rice, but you mustn't drink less wine. Last time when we were at war, people died every day. If you don't drink, you won't be able to get the dead out of your mind. Let's drink. On the 38th year of the Republic of China... No, it's 1949. Right. On the 14th of February of 1949, our troop had to retreat to Taiwan. The pier was filled with many people. It was so crowded and everyone was shouting and fighting to board the ship. There were only three ships. A big one and two small ones. The big ship was reserved for the senior officers and their families. Just when the big ship was getting ready to set sail, the people turned crazy. Everyone wanted to board the ship. Who wouldn't want to grab this last hope of survival? Thankfully, I managed to climb up a small ship. I remember that day was very cold and it was raining heavily. I remember that day very clearly. No, no. You have got it wrong. I remember it well. That day, our troop marched into Shanghai... and occupied the pier. It was a sunny day. It's not correct. 14th February, I remember it very well. I remember that day very well too. I am telling you. At that time, I was injured for the first time. And I got a medal for it. I remember we were supposed to meet at the 16th pier that day. - Right... - Right? I ran there but the place was so crowded that I couldn't find you. They told me the retreating troops were not there but at the Wusong Pier. I dashed over there but it was too late. The ships had left. I remember there was thunder and lightning that day. It was raining heavily and I was so scared. Later, the big ship sank. Those of us who were on the small ship survived instead. Life and death are fated. When we reached Taiwan, our troop was assigned to the Fifth Army, 14th division, 40th regiment to guard Kinmen. - You know Kinmen, right? - Yes, I do. When we were at Kinmen, we had to repair trenches and dig bunkers every day. And after that, we had to stand guard. Every day, we missed our families. Finally, some of us couldn't stand it any longer... and contemplated jumping into the sea to swim home. But that wasn't going to work. Flesh and blood against the freezing cold seawater... just how far could we swim? How much we missed home then can't be described in words. I will sing a song. My feelings at that time can be expressed through this song. Oh, Father... Oh, Mother... I am wandering. This is the youthful homeland of the children. This is the youthful homeland of the children. Oh, Father... Oh, Mother... I am wandering. This is the youthful homeland of the children. And it's our final home. For years and years, it collected my dreams, my love, my pain, and my hopes. - Does it sound nice? - Yes. Keep singing. Youthful hometown, my final home. Return, return and return... Return, return and return... Boys... Girls... Their love cannot be fulfilled. Return, return and return... Return, return and return... The youthful hometown of the children is my final home. This youthful hometown is my final home. Return, return and return... Return and return... I have finally returned. Brother, don't be sad. Come on, let's drink. Here. Drink up. I'll sing a song too. Great. Were you aware? She charmed me with her singing back then. I will sing "The Wandering Songstress". It's by Zhou Xuan. From the end of the world... to the remotest corner of the earth, I'm searching for my soulmate. The girl sings while the boy plays the zither. My love, we are united in our hearts. - Great singing. - You are as good as ever. Aiya... My love, our love through the hard times is deep. - Great. - The singing is excellent. It's the first time I'm hearing her sing. Brother Lu. I won't be taking Yu'er with me. I hope you can live healthily. Eat more nutritious food and drink less. Don't say that. I am fine. Look how strong I am. My appetite is back too. Tell you what. You two just get going in two days. To be honest, I couldn't get her to leave with me. Lastly, I just want to beg a favor of you. What is it? Can I sing a song with her? Sure. Can you still remember the song when we first met? - Can you? - "Champagne Everywhere". "Champagne Everywhere"! I can sing this song too. - You know this song? - I do. - How do you know this song? - I know. You have never talked about singing previously. Champagne's everywhere. Glistening decorations adorn the beauties' hair. Jazz music rings in the air. Couples are dancing everywhere. Arms around shoulders, swaying front and back. The dance steps are lingering, and so is love. You are casting glances at me so beautifully. How do you expect me to fall asleep tonight? Champagne's everywhere. Glistening decorations adorn the beauties' hair. Jazz music rings in the air. You and I are dancing everywhere. Hey! I am going back. I would like to leave some money for you. I hope it will be of some help to you. No matter how much you blame me, I can accept it. If there's opportunity, I hope you get married and raise a family. This money... just take it... as a small token of love from your father. You have never done your duty as a father. And I have no feelings toward you. I am no longer young. Whether I'm married or not no longer bothers me. You should keep the money as your pension. No matter where you are, money will always be needed. Mom, on the day he leaves, I will there to send him off. I will be leaving tomorrow. Please allow me to say some words. Coming from Taiwan to the mainland, I have received lots of care this trip and I thank you all for this. Since I was young, I've loved to sing. But I stopped singing for years. Today, I want to sing a song... to express my gratitude. This song was very famous in Taiwan in the 1970s. - It's called "Drizzling". - Drizzling. This is my best kept performance, and also, pretty much my whole repertoire. Applause, please. It's drizzling outside. Feeling melancholy, who can I confide in? who... Sing after the rain stops. Right, sing after the rain stops. Let's go. The rain's getting heavy. Come and shelter quickly. (foreign language) Don't cry, don't cry. I'll be back soon. Take care of your health. Don't cry. - Don't cry. - You take care of your health too. I will. Rest more and don't tire yourself out. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Keep yourself warm. Wear the cashmere top that I bought for you, okay? Beware of late spring coldness. Stop crying. Once we part today, I wonder if we'll ever meet again. Of course we will. We are still young. Let's both live well, okay? Take care of yourself. You should go now. The ship's setting sail soon. Come back to visit us when you have the chance. I will. Goodbye. I wonder when we will meet again after today's parting. Goodbye. Go home. Goodbye. (One year later) Today's a festive day. Your dad has been waiting for you. While waiting for you, he's so hungry that he's now munching cookies. He wanted to wait for you to start dinner. I have cooked lots of dishes for you. They're all your favorite. Try to come soon. Are you sure you can't? I will save some food for you then. It can't be helped. Bye. Our eldest couldn't come. And now, Xinhua just called to say she can't make it back either. As for Aihua, I can't contact her. I have cooked so many dishes and nobody's around to eat them. Try calling Aihua again. I can't find her. Stop eating those cookies. You will be too full to eat later. My appetite is good. I can still eat later. It's better that they are not here. I am already hungry, and I'll eat up all the food. Moreover, since we moved into this new house, they haven't been visiting much. - Let's start our dinner. - Let's eat. That's true. Although our old house is small, it's livelier. Now that we have moved into a new and bigger house, none of them visit us. Our new house is further out. It's not convenient for them to drop by. Come on, let's eat. Finish up all the food. No leftovers, please. Grandpa, Grandma, I have decided to marry him. So, you are really getting married this time? Are you really? Yes. Sounds good. We have an empty room. Shall we make it their wedding room? Ask him to move in with us. - It will be livelier if we stay together. - Right, it will be livelier. We'll register our marriage first. The banquet will be held after he's back. He's going to the States for two years. Why must he be away for so long? He will be away in the States for two years? Won't he jilt you? He won't! Although he said he will be away for two years, you'll never know for sure when he'll come back. No matter how long it takes, it can't be longer than the time you waited. Forget about how long it will take. Time passes while we are eating too. For my entire life, my appetite has been good. A person is dead if he doesn't eat. So, come on. Let's eat. Finish up every dish. No leftovers. Let's eat.
