It was just a joke, dressing up. I never joke, I chastise. Thanks, guys! Thank you, life! THANK YOU, LIFE! What's this muck'? Are you crazy? You looked like an octopus lying there. Stupid bitch! A guy just beat me up. Does that happen to you often? What? Do guys often beat you up'? All the time. Just forget it. God, she's fainted. - No doctor. - I'll decide that. Go suck an egg, then! I'm sick of doctors. They feel you up, then pack you off. Can you manage the steps? Of course. If I try to rise in the world, there are never any lifts. All stairs are good for is varicose veins. They get you home. - You have a home? - One I share. Who with? My parents. At least come and clean up. No parents, thanks. My parents are away; they won't be back until July. Stay... you're the friend I hoped for. A gift from heaven. Yes, but... I'm a fallen woman. I won't ask questions, like why the wedding-dress or the beating up. I have to revise for my exams; I've falled three times. While I work, you can rest. My name's Camille. I-m Joélle. Do you feel the emotional current? They'll love this scene. What scene? The two of us out here, night coming on. What do they expect? Who? The dirty raincoat brigade. There's no one around for miles. With two girls involved, however ugly, there's always a Peeping Tom. Here, watch. Look at them work. Top floot left... see the window open? Do you sense the watcher in the window? I don't know. Or the story gathering pace? It is a turn-on. Time to go and eat. What's going on'? What's up? Short-circuit'? How did you manage that? Hands where they shouldn't have been? He's got roving hands. Where have the guys got to'? What guys? Have you seen any guys? There are always guys around. Oh, for God's sake! What's got into you? Listen, girls... I'll spend the evening with you, on certain conditions. - What are we doing in bed? - Don't you like beds? - Show us that hard thing guys have. - We're virgins, eager to learn. I want no trouble; I'm moonlighting. Mind closing your mouth? Not another sound out of it. What we want out is your thing. Mind your manners, or I'll hit you again. The battered victim is stunned. Short-circuit! There, look! Is it going to explode? Just let it come naturally. The best thing is to stick close. Listen, girls... - There'd be dancing, if it was Saturday. - But it isn't. It's always Saturday with me, and I have my cap. Hear the accordions? - Can you afford champagne? - Look in my pockets and see. How come you're so nice all of a sudden? First you kick up a fuss... ...now you're as happy as a lark. What's your game? Maybe he's in love... suddenly smitten. Are you in love, my lad? That's nice, so are we; we fell for you right away. Right, Camille? We don't even know his name. It's Francois. I've been watching you and your seagulls for weeks and weeks. You have'? So? Guess. You're devoted to me? My tears and my throbbing heart are yours to do with as you will. Screw that sort of declaration of love. I don't know this guy. Dance with my friend. Go on! - I want to dance with you. - I'm not dancing. I feel ill. My stomach hurts. Dance with my friend. Thanks for the enthusiasm. Let me get used to the idea. Get going, then. Don't you fancy her? It's not that. Can't you see she's miserable? Go on, set her heart throbbing, that's what she needs. She's loosening up; show you love her. Hold her really close. What's this thing about brides? Forget it, she might be another phony. You attend to your painter. What's he up to'? He's running away. Don't run, it's bad for the bust. Besides, we're not into men. We're much too young and cute. Wait for me, girls! I feared for you, my love. You like classical music? I'll play some: yearning for tenderness mode. Men usually beat me up, but I'm sure you'll respond with tenderness. Do you mind if I watch? She wants to see how it's done. I'm very interested in sexual matters. It's not all it's cracked up to be. Don't start looking for ways out. Make an entrance; your audience is waiting. Comes naturally, doesn't it'? I like guys who moonlight. They've more time for you. My best ever was unemployed; I had him to myself all day. Jim Pascal. A guitarist. Watch it, girl; tears spilling aren't always tears of joy. What's wrong? Is he ill? Let's go! - But look at his glassy eyes. - They're like that after they come. - Do you think I made him come'? - Let's go; I've swiped his money. You piss me off; I liked it with him. Stay, then; go order a pram. Wait for me, girls! What now? Thanks. What for? For the love-making. It's we who thank you. I'd like to go with you. It's too dangerous where we're headed. If we make it, I'll come back. I'll bear you a child; he'll have your eyes. I never did get to eat. - Do you feel the sense of danger? - What sense of danger? The two of us, defenceless in the dark. Look, there's a car outside your place. What's it to do with me? I'm afraid it may be me. Stay here, I'll look. - Where's your girl-friend? - I don't have one. You're all alone? Yes, I'm all alone. - Like to have some fun? - I've homework to do. I got no education; all I got was trouble. Right now... ...l've got the clap. - Where's your friend? - What friend? Fat, with a big mouth. Hot stuff. Are you talking about my friend? My job's security. I've a daughter your age. Know what I do? Sucker-Daddy takes care of her pussy. I pleasure her... ...so she leaves the yobs alone. What does her mother say'? Her mother keeps her mouth shut; she knows girls are my speciality... ...that I go to great lengths to protect them. My father doesn't protect me. I run wild, then he weeps. It's a father's lot to weep. A cola? No; if I drink I pee, and it's like pissing razor-blades. Sit on my knee. - Are you going to feel me up'? - No, I'm not. I have no rights over you. - Just tell me where your friend is. - Stealing your car. - What do you mean? - She's stealing your car. Bitch! - Who was it, the lawyer? - No, security! - Oh, Robert... any message for me? - Take off, quick! - You're in second. - Shut up! Shake him off! I can't! Drive in there! - Where are we headed? - We're on the road. - Hear the synthesizers? - What synthesizers? You always hear synthesizers on the road. Silly bitch! How am I going to pass my exams? Can you hear them now? - Are you heading for Clermont? - It's getting cold and we're tired. Be nice and give us a lift? We'd be extra nice in return. Get off! - What's he on about? - I said get off! Aren't we nice? Are you getting off or not'? Rotten sod! That's the fellowship of the road for you! Let's see your forearms. Show him your forearms. Just do as he says. You ought to be a cop. Sorry, but I've a wife and kids. - My feet hurt. - So do mine. - Have you ever taken over a town'? - What do you mean? Everyone in town sleeping as we arrive. Get the idea? As though they were dreaming us. What are those lights? Can't you see them shining? - Let's get closer. - Suppose it's a trap? I'm drawn by light, dangerous or not. - Are all these lights for us'? - Who else? Look! Just look at that! Like it, girls? - Are you shooting a film? - Yes. Where's everybody? Eating; we start again in 15 minutes. Would you like something to eat'? Do you want to eat'? Something nice and hot. Well... yes. The bitch! - Good God! - What a nerve, coming back. It's that slut Joélle! Bitch on two legs! Rotten little chippie! Mind your costumes, you walk-ons! What the hell's going on here? I'm the director... ...and I might just decide to move to another location. Do you realize the loss of trade involved? What idiot brought her! How was I to know? What did you do to these goons? Marc-Antoine started it all. Who's Marc-Antoine? Is there a cretin here called Marc-Antoine? I was a young intern then, looking for a racket to feather my nest. A terrible new form of the clap suddenly appeared. Fascinating. Who's next? - My cock was on fire... - Tell me about this bride. How did you know? I didn't want that known. Well, it's known now. - What can I tell you? - The lot: her name, where she's from. She told me she moved around, never stayed in one place. She told me incredible things... ...that she wanted never to leave me. A brunette, with an olive complexion and beauty spots. The kind of girl you lose yourself in. "Don't go, stay a bit longer." Who clamps her thighs on you. I need some clue to help me find her. - What for? - To cure her. She can't go on running wild. I'm the local agent for Pronuptia. I'd just raised the shutters. It was 9 a.m.; I was having my coffee... ...when the waif appeared. Describe her. She came from Porte de Clermont way. Shivering, she stopped at my window display. She came in and asked if she could try on the low-cut white dress. May I try it on'? She looked like a fallen woman; her slip was pathetically shabby. Try whatever you like. She Ioked at me, her eyes filled with gratitude. - Will you give me one? - One what? A dress, stupid; it's my heart's desire. Of course I will. In return, I'll give you all the love a woman can give a man. She was in my arms. "I'll close the shop", I said. Do, and I'll show you my wares. I have some delights on offer. When I opened up again, she didn't want to go. "Why not marry me?" she said. "I'm all ready but for a priest." I'll do anything! I'll run the shop while you screw around. I'll just wait patiently and never complain, I promise you. I kicked her out. - With the dress? Where did she go? - South, to see the sea. Doc at the wheel, driving frantically! Turning a corner, he comes across a bridge thumbing a lift. "I want a nice girl to marry", he says. "I'm the girl for you", she says... ...getting in beside him. A good match, a good lay, and entirely biddable. Is this what they call a flashback? I'd call it bliss. He was Marc-Antoine, a great guy. You and your bloody spotlights! Doctor Warm? This way. - Mind your head. - Let go of me. Leave us. I'm not well, Marco; I have a lot of alarming symptoms. Haven't we all? First the beating up, now strangling. I foresee an unhappy ending. I told you not to come back. You haven't lost much weight? Does this hurt? Have you a cough? If you like. - Do you have diarrhoea? - Do you want me to'? Just answer; it's no joke any more. How are things with you? You have kids? Tell me about them. Never mind my kids. Don't go, Marco. I'm not jealous, just interested. - Is it serious? - She'll sleep now. Why trip me up'? I don't like your bedside manner. So you're the shit-stirrer? No, that's my friend, I've homework to do, I want to go home. I'm the film producer. Are you important? - Very. - Wait till he signs you up! I couldn't be a producer if I didn't inspire confidence. Should I take my panties off'? Could you say that again? - Should I take my panties off'? - Once more. - Should I take my panties off? - It's your face I'm interested in. MY face? - He's screwed you already? - We're going to Make-up. - What for? - Read about it in the papers. No one's interested in my glum face, or in my butt. - Want to know what happened? - No, thanks, it'd choke me. Silly cow! People don't fall ill here, doctor. They die suddenly, or not at all. Doctors can't make a living here. - Suppose I import the illness? - Not a bad idea. Wait there and prepare yourself. Tests, research... an epidemic could be very profitable. Waking up one morning to pee... ...I suddenly felt this burning sensation. "What have you been up to?" I asked my husband. I was heartbroken when she left... ...filled with flowery dreams. I slept with father, son, businessman, yokel. I'd straw in my hair, thighs tanned by the sun... ...ears wet from their slavering. He arrived at dinner-time. I sat him on the love-seat and attended to his need. Then, he fell asleep, drooling a bit. You've to screw everyone capable of getting it up. - And will you screw me? - When I'm rich. Well... that looks nasty. I don't find it nasty. Everything's nasty to the nasty. You get up and look in the mirror: you're nasty. Your wife's nasty. Your apartment's probably nasty, too. On a sunny day, you think it's dull. That's because you're old. You'll be dead soon. You'll die, too. - Why tell me that? - I love you, Joélle. I love you, too, but why say I'll die'? You must leave town. I'll join you afterwards. After? What do you mean? A car will take you to a friend's clinic in Saint-Raphaél; he'll cure you. I love you; I'll give you everything I have. He'll hang as a pimp and your head will be shaved! You'll be stoned! Marc-Antoine! Where are you taking me? Why don't you speak? - I'm taking you home. - I have no home. The road's your home. - You're not leaving me here? - You killed a man, remember? - Haven't you some money? - Not in this coat. What about my royalties? What about my royalties? Cut! You think people are stupid? Who'd believe such a story? It's my life, crappy or not. Some crap smells sweet, some not. She can take her make-up off. But the producer liked me. Go home, movies aren't for you. Haven't you troubles enough already? Camille. She's taken off, the slut. I'd a good friend, but she's taken off. I'd a good friend... Camera... "Distress With Tears". Scene 210. Take 1. Action! I'd a good friend, but she's taken off. No, I haven't; here I am, see'? - Did you think I'd abandon you? - No, but you gave me a scare. Want to meet a good friend of mine? - What does he do? - He's a doctor, a terrific guy. Wake up, Marc-Antoine; it's me, Joélle! The prick isn't answering. Sure this is the right house? - Wouldn't a dozy doctor live here? - I've no idea. Get out of bed, Marc-Antoine; it's Joélle, your childhood sweetheart. I'm not in, I'm at the clinic. What exactly did he say'? That he wasn't in, that he was at the clinic. - So what do we do? - We go to the clinic. You reckon? Go on; I said I was there. You do recognize me? Of course I do. Don't push me, Marc-Antoine! Let's beat it. Girls like you cause these things. - How do you know we're such girls? - What kind of girls, anyway? Leave them alone; can't you see they're distressed? But they're slanging us... why? You've nothing to do with it! - What are they doing here, then? - I don't know! Let's go. I want to know what's going on, why all the grief? You really want to know? I can tell you if you want. No, really, thanks... I had a lover, very handsome... Daddy, come and rescue me. I'm too young for this stuff. Daddy, I'm calling for help! I'm talking to him, but the fool won't answer. Let me chat him up. This is Joélle, Camille's friend. Shit, the prick hung up. Not even a hello. I like talking to fathers, not having one. Kick the slut out, Marc-Antoine! You're wanted, Doctor Warm! - I bet the bastard's screwing her. - Don't bugger around, Joelle! It's my house, I've a right to wreck my own house! We want our royalties, pimp! Let's see the kids! The kids! The kids! The kids! Is there some problem? My friend needs to see the doctor. He's at the clinic. He's not at the clinic. We just saw him there. Then why come here? - Desperation. - To see your pretty face. - It seems you've got kids. - Where are the darlings? - Don't touch them! - Just watch us! They aren't scared; the poor dears are having fun. See how my fingers stink? Is your twat rotting, too? - Marc-Antoine! - He's at the clinic. Unless you're kidding, Marc-Antoine. Are you hiding in a wardrobe? Oh, my love... Where's she got to'? Are you all right'? - You know what would be nice? - No, what would be nice? A maid; this house is too much for me. She's babbling to Marc-Antoine. - I want to go back to university. - I'll call the clinic. - Hold on tight! - I am! Stop Playing the goat; let's go! - Did I die? - No, you're just tired. Why am I so weightless, then? Let me go... people are waiting for me. I've come for my daughter. I've come for my daughter. You've come for your daughter. - I've come for my daughter. - Name'? We've any amount of girls. Camille Pelvoux; I'm sure she's here. She called for my help. The scanner won't help; I already know from palpation what it will show. - Who's this character? - He keeps following me. - I've come for my daughter. - Go to reception, then. They let just anyone in. I've been wandering around for half an hour. I can't find out where my daughter is. - What's her name? - Camille Pelvoux. She's only a child, and I'm anxious about her. Have you admitted her? Not that new pair, I hope. One of them is positive. - What does "positive" mean? - Something nasty, I'm afraid. Let's hop it. - And go where? - Somewhere nice, with movies in colour. - Are we in black and white? - Naturally we are. Running away? Before you have a stroke! What stroke? Is someone having a stroke? Yes, someone is. Some poor devil. I've been happy; don't ruin your life over me! My mother used to be beautiful before I was born. Before the ravages of motherhood. Was your father handsome, too? Better than now; younger, anyway. It's doubtful whether he is my father. - I want to touch you. - I strongly advise against it. She didn't want children? She couldn't stand male flesh. Just once, please; I want you so much! - You always want me. - And never get to screw you! It's night now, the parents are asleep. Camille approaches the bed. Do something; it won't just happen! Who are you? It's not possible... God, how pretty you are. I'm still in your balls, and fed up. She won't let me touch her! Touch away. You can move your hand, can't you? If I do, she'll clobber me! Your dad's nice. Sure, he's nice; the problem is he's soft. I want you to be hard. lam. Poke her, then. How? Doesn't she make you randy? - Who? - Your wife. I don't know if it's her, but... Screw her and I'm yours. When? Some day... you'll see. Maybe I should be born first. I'll show you some hot stuff. - Oh, God! Watch my hand. - We're watching. It's heading for my wife's butt. I'm touching it. It's as cool as a dew-laden flower. What's going on'? Infiltration by finger. - You're hotting up, and it suits you. - You're sweating, and you stink. - I want to fuck you. - You're always so crude. I'm going to screw you till you bite the pillow, unable to yell for help. And then, when I'm good and ready, I'll shoot my whole load into you! - She's faking, so you'll feel guilty. - But I love her! - I bet she's dying for it. - Go on, stick it in. She's fainted, get a doctor! Help! Doctor! - What's all the noise? - My wife's in a bad way. - What did you do, beat her up'? - No, I caressed her. Funny way to die. - Call a doctor! - The pathologist, you mean! Caught red-handed! My first... murderer. - Did you have an orgasm? - There wasn't time. - You're family? - Not yet! You may rise, Madame. Thank you, sir. What a woman. If she were mine... ...I'd be content just to look. I keep telling him that. He can look at me all day... ...even on the toilet, if he wants. Lucky sod! It's busy hands and tongues I hate. I'm the forensic pathologist; where is the... body? I forbid you to touch me. Sorry, but I must check every orifice for traces of sperm. If I find none, I have enough bottled samples to satisfy any jury. You can't let him do this. The police must defer to science, Madame... ...in determining the time of death and nature of the sexual assault. Please assume the pose, Madame. Like this? Legs wider apart. Are you sure this is really necessary? All this Polaroid shows me is parted thighs. It's all too much for me. I must lie down a moment. It isn't much to ask, five sodding minutes, is it'? I told you she'd give us problems. She's going to drive us crazy. Evangeline, darling, you were wonderful. What's wrong? I'm right here, darling. Stop that bloody rain! - I hate playing selfish bitches! - It's what your fans expect, darling. To hell with my fans! Do without your bit of porn; I'm not spreading my legs! - Maybe a baby would calm her down. - For real, or in the film? In the film, I guess. Who the hell's she? She'd still be a balls-acher, of course. If you like, I'd play the part for nothing. How old are you? Whatever you say... twelve, eighteen. Pretty or plain, I can do it. Please. I can see you're interested. You're a fine director. Did you see my latest? Unfortunately, no. Despicable trash, the critics said. Monsieur and Madame Pelvoux. Will you do it together? Just Monsieur. Here's your test-tube. Take your time. Ring when you've finished. "Life". Scene 135. Take 1. Is he going to take all morning? It'll be a fine, 10 lb. girl. Your job is simply to inject me; I'll stand no familiarity from the help. Sixteen years later, I turn up. The street's as narrow as ever. My friend's with me. You are my friend? Yes, I'm your friend. - I'll introduce my parents. - They live here? They'll be older. I like old people, especially live ones. Try to look your best for my father. - Do you hear the synthesizers? - Yes, I hear them. It's lovely, all the clocks... Concentrate on being sweet. I am sweet. I've a present for you. - Is it something to eat'? - No, to touch. She's my best friend. You seem to be very pretty. Who are you talking to, Raymond? It's your chance to start a new life, Papa. Raymond, just what are you up to'? Go screw yourself, you old bag! Did he say "old bag"? You heard me, you stinking old sponge! Here we are, getting acquainted. Who's this baggage? My secret love. We're going to beat it with your money. Don't you dare! Careful, it's loaded. You'd shoot your own mother? It happens every day. Would you rather be brained? Why not do both'? Go, I'll cover you! Look out for me! Oh, no, that'd be too bloody stupid! Like the younger me, handsome and spry. Nothing broken, my love? You look pale and weary. Because I came running. No need for me to rush in. Perhaps I should simply... Starting a new life is fine if you can choose when. - What are those clowns'? - Germans. Who killed the Jews? I won't live then! Cut! Are you asking for a thick ear, sabotaging my first film? I know it's shit; the masterpieces can wait, but you won't be in them. Look at him! No wonder we lost the war. You make me ashamed to be French. Ashamed. Don't... my daughter's watching. Sorry, but bawling people out is company policy. - What is that actor's name? - Raymond Pelvoux. Quiet! At once! Camera! "The Critical Moment". Take 1. Papers, please. I'm just a watchmaker, with no interest in anything else, especially politics. - Why are you outside, watchmaker? - I'm meeting someone. Who? Me. - So! Dirty French pig, eh'? - Very dirty. - That's why you lost the war. - Right... but one day we'll win. Just look at the bitch... she'd agree to anything. I have a confession to make; I'm extremely nervous. I'm nervous, too. Especially about the terribly intimate scenes we're to play. I haven't really thought about it. I think of nothing else. The scene with the compress? The scene with the compress. The scene with the compress, as you ask... ...and I knew you would ask... ...is a scene that... how shall I put it?... just came to me. I didn't understand it, but the images haunted me. They were unbearable, yet haunting. At night, as others slept, I wandered the hotel corridors, gnawed by doubt. Could audiences take the scene with the compress? In there sleeps an actress... not with me, but she couldn't care less. Probably screwing one of the crew, while I, the director, never get any. - I'm here. - Why am I chained up'? I don't know... I never said handcuffs. Where can the keys be? Wait, I'll get help. Do I put the blood on now? - Won't it coagulate? - No, it's haemophiliac blood. The script was nicer when I read it. It was springtime in Normandy when I wrote it. In those days, we German spractised torture. Refined torture. And experiments... scientific experiments. Do you favour one eye over the other, watchmaker? Don't worry, daddy, it's only a film. Someone has shat himself here. - The scene with the compress. - Wait! My husband's being tortured. Take me home to my clocks, please. No more new life? No, it's too dangerous! You'll dump your Resistance friend? Resistance? I never say no! Isn't she lovely? Sorry, Mademoiselle, I'm no hero. We were the heroes. Nothing could resist us. No town, no woman. - Is this your wife? - I can't see properly. Will that help? Now I can see. - Is she your wife? - Yes, she's my wife. Watch this. She's mine, any time! - Ready with the compress? - Ready. Ready, doctor? - You'll let my kids go? - Later. - Camera! - "Scene with the Compress". Take 1. When I was little, I had a nightmare... always the same nightmare. A man with a dressing over his eye... always the same man. He took off the dressing, and the eye came with it. That's why I'd cry, and you'd come to comfort me. I don't want my little girl to cry. - Shut up! - No more wars, ever! - You were told to shut up. - I'm caressing your wife, intimately. Removal of the compress! Cut! Everyone out! We'll do another take. I never really realized you were so sweet. - How was it'? - Splendid. We'll do it again. - The other eye this time. - Why not my balls, too? You must look after yourself, darling, you're very ill. What's wrong with me? Come on, we're ready! - Sorry, I've something to tell her. - And I've a film to make. And I don't want to die. The place is packed with Germans. This woman is very ill, and I'm a doctor. I may have behaved like a rat... ...but now I'm doing my duty, and you're the rats. Watch this. Yes, I'm in the Resistance. I run a field hospital for them. Later, I'll run in the municipal elections on a Gaullist ticket. Once elected, I'll be a rat again. A right-wing rat! But at the moment I'm a hero. You're all dead; the place is surrounded. Cut! You idiots! I didn't ask for bullet-holes. The attack doesn't come now! Real bullets, the cretins! Do we fight or take cover'? - Take cover. - There's the place, then. - Shut up! - I didn't speak. No, but you were going to. So shut up! - I didn't speak! - Shut up! - Why are the idiots shooting? - I've no idea. Nobody hurt, I hope. Cover, I said, not front-line action! It's wartime, July '43. Come, see your rooms. - No luggage? - Do I look the sort'? Mine's in my pants. She got hit! Don't let me die. She can't; she's not born yet. You're a pain in the arse. Look, my hands are all bloody. Do you think we've nothing better to do? - This war of yours scares me. - It scares all of us. Can't you see that? Is it any reason for dying'? Fight won't kill us. Besides... ...wars end and life begins again. Look at your dad getting his teeth into life. I'll get you some French letters. - What for? - Don't listen, he's a doctor. Why French letters? Doesn't he ever read the papers? What period are we in, anyway? If there's AIDS, there's no Boches. If there's Boches, there's no AIDS... and we can screw! It should be a time when one could make love without fear of dying. With no Boches, either. I'm sick of their crap, which cost me an eye. - Were you at Verdun? - Near there. In a trench filled with water. I left my youth in that water. Suppose I make you a gift of mine? I'm a simple, honest girl. I wouldn't mind; a bit of affection wouldn't come amiss. I like to offer affection. Give, and you shall receive. Where men are concerned, I mean. I've always loved men, even when they exploited or beat me. You've known many? Quite a few. I must confess one thing, though... it's a bit embarrassing. - You're pregnant? - How did you guess? One can tell right away. You're so beautiful. You'll accept me, anyway? I'll accept you as a gift. It'll be a girl; we'll call her Camille. Camille... how pretty... What is it like being happy, daddy? Tears are never far away, you know... never far away. Cut. We've got it made for Cannes, kids. Bloody smoke gets in your eyes. Couldn't we do a retake? - How's your film going? - Nearly finished. - I feel I know this station. - What do you mean? I know it. - You've been here before? - You have, too. We hid up here. You and Joelle were always in bed, making love. - There's no bed. - There used to be one. I remember how you two moaned and giggled all the time. I watched you. I drank in your happiness. - When was this? - During the war. You knew nothing of the war; it was long over when you were born. My daughter did brilliantly in her exams. - Isn't Joélle eating with you? - No, she's in her room. - Is something wrong? - She's tired. - What do you mean, "tired"? - Tired. Look what you've done to my beauty. I used to be like her. Men were bewitched by my figure. Try drinking less. Yes, I drink. I prefer that to becoming dried up like a prune. I'm saving myself for my public. Who run a mile if your name's on the credits. Does your daughter like your wrinkles? Keep her out of this; she's my daughter. Cow I may be, but I'm fond of her. I'm an ageing actor. - So? - It gets you down. - But you're popular, much in demand. - For small parts. Watchmakers, submissive types, always insignificant. The plot never revolves around me. I might as well not be there. I'd like to have been a great actor. Every stone has its place, you'll say. But the best I can hope for now is to die playing a small part. "Remember Raymond Pelvoux? He was good." "He was... good." Why don't you come to see me? My room's cold and lonely, too. I will later, I have to see Joélle first. She's in 29, the best room, naturally. - Is it really like this? - What? Life. You've a nice little face, you know. I thought you'd ditch me, too. My father was talking to me. How's your film going? All right. You don't seem too cheerful. You don't seem too cheerful. - I'm all right. - Are you sure'? This film of theirs isn't much fun, that I can tell you. Why? Tell me about it. It's about a girl who's seriously ill; so ill that she's going to die. I play her, and it's a good part. A girl who dies at the end of the film is a good part, you must admit. What's wrong with her? They don't know... despite all their researches. Don't know how to cure her, I mean. Because they know what the disease is, all right. They're full of it. They get all worked up about it at conferences, in TV specials. But meanwhile, I'm... I don't want to die, Camille. Maybe I did screw around too much and this serves me right... ...but nobody warned me it was dangerous. I thought that was what life was all about, I thought life was beautiful. I'm too young to die. Aren't you arresting me? Stop shoving! - The Jews got us into this mess. - What mess? The war, our lives wrecked. This is just a film I'm producing. Where's the camera? I can't see it; that's what bothers me. Let me by, I'll see about this. We can't; they'll shoot us. They're only blanks, you idiot. Such things happen only in films now. We'll make other movies, you'll see. American movies. - Will you take me to Hollywood? - Would you repeat that? - Will you take me to Hollywood? - Again. - Will you take me to Hollywood? - Yes. A bit of fresh air does you good. God, he stinks! He shit his pants. That'll be nice, stuck in holiday traffic jams. No one made you come. It's no fun for him, all shitty in the hot sun. Just look at him. He's always looked miserable because he was. I'm not going to wreck my life like him, living with a loser. No quarrelling, children. - What do you mean,"loser"'? - I take that back. We'll be too late to buy groceries. Sorry about "loser". Don't yell! Why is she yelling like that? Sorry, children, I'm on edge, too. I'm off to the supermarket. Let's get the luggage. Don't fret too much; sometimes it's great. - What is? - Life, girl, you'll see. It isn't all shit. - You think so? - I know so. Let's go and take a shower; we've earned it.
