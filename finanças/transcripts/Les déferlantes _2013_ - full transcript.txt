BREAKERS Can I help you? Yes. Excuse me. I'm looking for someone named Louise Léger. She might be here. - Have you seen her? - Why? - Are you the police? - No. - It's personal. - No. Sorry. I don't know this woman. If you see her, call me. My number's on the back. It's very important. A woman from Paris was looking for you today. A Ms Gray. She left a number for you to call her. She said it's important. Don't worry. I didn't say I knew you. I don't know any Ms Gray. It must be a mistake. Is this a mistake? Why don't you dress like that here? Aren't we good enough? We don't know much about your past. Maybe you were in trouble. What was it? A money problem? Or was it a love affair? Oh, Lili! Stop it. I haven't tallied your tab. Pay at the end of the month. Théo'd like to eat the same as us. If he's not happy, he can go elsewhere. But he's your father. He is. But you can have him if you want. Now he's yours. OK? That's not what I meant. I like him. Sure. He likes you too, no doubt. Because he can tell you anything and you believe him. Like my mother. He cheated on her. Hey, Lili! Two coffees over here. Where do you live? I'll take you home. You leapt into the volcano without me. I even helped you. I'm left on the edge of the crater like a fool, and I can't join you. Today I thought I could, then a man appeared and stopped me. I thought it was you stopping me, through him. He gave me his jacket. It was warm. I felt good, like with you. Then I felt ashamed. I'd like to turn the page and live in the present again. Excuse me. Hello. I'm looking for someone called Louise Léger. - Have you seen her? - No. If you see her, will you call me? My number's there. - OK. - Thanks. - Here. - Thanks. Don't piss on the neighbour's wall. It's not you they shout at. There's someone in the house opposite. Pass me the binoculars. It's the Caron boy! Really? That's Lambert Caron? Sad, what happened to his family. Louise, you don't know the story? - No. - You must be the only one. They were Parisians who holidayed here. He sailed the Route du Rhum. One day he took his wife and baby to sea. They returned after nightfall. The lighthouse lamp was off. They were shipwrecked. They all died? The baby's body was never found. As if you saw it all. You were three years old. I heard they were hippies. The parents went around naked. Well, I must be off. Thanks. Bye, everyone. Hello, Florelle. You found it on the beach? It's me, Louise. What can I do with it? Who's that? It's me, Théo. Louise. What? It's not time. Florelle sent me. You didn't pass anyone? No. A Mercedes? No. Why? Are you expecting someone? It's paralyzed. Probably ate something from the dump. I'll try to feed it. - We'll see. - I brought it for Florelle. Strange how you do whatever Florelle wants. I can't say no to her. - But it's different for me. - Why? What exactly is wrong with Florelle? She's 30 years older than you, and doesn't remember. Was there something between you? Shouldn't I ask that? Do I ask you why you settled here to rot? You and I are the same, we both have our secrets. Tristan! It's you, Tristan! Why don't you ever come to see me? I'm Lambert. Tristan! Florelle! Florelle, don't do that. - What? Yes! - Don't do that. Tristan! Come, Florelle, let's go. Let me go! Don't get annoyed. Let me go. - I'm angry. - Why are you angry? I'm very angry. Oh, you're here? Well, yes. I'd like to understand. And I'm glad to see you again. I was worried about you. I'll bring your jacket back tomorrow. You know, Florelle's always doing that. She lost all her family at sea, so... Whenever there's been a storm... She thinks the sea will give them back? Something like that, I think. And she sees their faces in others. My mother told me about her when we came on holiday here. Didn't she look after orphans? Maybe. I don't know. Can I drop you in town? Come on. What are you doing here? I'm an ornithologist. I watch birds. Have you been here long? Since September. Where were you before? Why do you ask? Just curious. What brings you here? I'm selling... my grandmother's house. She died last month. No. Not for her. I hit a sparrow. - Can you see it? - No. It's gone. What's up? I'll leave you here. The baskets are for a sick friend who lives here. I'm visiting him. Who's this friend? Théo, Lili's father. From the café opposite you. I took over his ornithology work. That brought us together. "Théo"? You know him? No. Not in person. But when I was little, he was the lighthouse keeper. Really? I didn't know. I'll return your jacket. Thanks for everything. Théo! It's me! It's Louise! Théo? I'll deal with it. You didn't come last night. Something came up. Well, you did right. If it was to bring this... Puss. Even he won't eat it. You've never cleaned up someone's shit. I can see that. With me, you see real life. The kind that stinks when it leaves. You should thank me. I don't know if I can come tomorrow. Wait. I had a son by Florelle. In memory of Paul Caron 25 May 1986 - 4 February 1988 Lost at sea Oh, my Tristan! I'm not your Tristan. I'm Lambert. It's you! Go on! Don't come here. Go home, please. Go on. My Tristan... Florelle and I were childhood sweethearts. I should have married her. But Lili's mother got pregnant, and I had to step up. Her parents died. Strangely, that helped things between us. Though she was already a bit mad. She's the last of the Coulons de Couvert. Their coat of arms... is on the church bell. They were the lords of the manor. - They had beachcombing rights. - What? Whatever was found on the beach was theirs. Wood, treasure... Anything. They'd never have let me have her. Why don't you live with her? It's too late. Too much history. We didn't agree about the kid. She lived alone with him. He was about 15. She was already... I wanted him to live with me, so I could sort him out. She refused because of Lili's mom. She closed the orphanage. Things got worse. What became of the boy? He went away. Never seen again. She never got over it. Maybe he'll come back, when she dies. An inheritance is always good. Was his name Tristan? She talked about him? The man who brought me here. She called him Tristan. She thought he was her brother. Her son, rather. - The man who brought you? - Lambert Caron. He's come to sell his house. I'm touched you told me this. It's good you did. "Peter, "I can't do without you. "I really can't. "I should move on, "but that's so hard! "Though I left everything, "your name keeps coming back. "That man's name's Lambert. Doesn't suit him. "He should have a Breton name. "A sailor's name. "Like Pierrick, maybe." I know, Doctor. He took what you prescribed for nerves. It doesn't work for him. Fuck. No way! Wait, I'll ask him. 30th, OK, afternoon. I won't go, I tell you. Yes. Yes, yes. I have to go, Doctor. Yes. Hello. How can I help? I'll serve him. Remember me? Lambert Caron. I arrived two days ago. I saw someone, but I wasn't sure. It's been a while! 24 years. I'm selling the house. What can I get you? A cider. Your house... what's the price? I thought 200,000. 200,000 euros? You'll still be here in a year. At 170,000 euros, I'll find you a buyer. Cheers. How are your parents? Great. Mum's dead. Dad still drinks. But it's OK. We get by. They say it's hereditary. What's wrong? Is the cider off? That night, was your father drinking? "That night"? You know what night. Hey, calm down. The night my parents drowned, the light wasn't working. He didn't act. Was he drunk? Who said that? The police report. You should leave. - Get out. - Who's this? Let's go out. Piss off. I don't know you. OK. Let go! Let go! OK! Enough! Don't touch me. - A little shell... - Florelle! Théo! Florelle... You must stop following the Caron boy. My brother's eyes were this colour. I'm not here to talk about your brother. Look! Another one. Florelle, it's important. Florelle. If you follow him, he'll start asking questions. You see? Florelle... Promise you'll let him be? - Where's Lili? - They've gone. Who was the sailor? No idea. I never saw him before. Seems he was on a submarine, but he went mad. What Caron said about Théo and the light, is it true? Maybe. But he tells so many stories about Théo, like the one about his kid with the madwoman... Is it true? No idea, I'm from Omonville. Some say he was just an orphan. They tell stories about me too. - Really? - Yes. I let them talk. Do you think Caron's good in bed? The way he went mad, surely. Do you fancy him? I do. I must go. Louise, the woman looking for you, is it to do with a man? Lili thinks it's to do with money. Did you steal her man? Not her man. Her brother. Seeing us together all day long, people will start talking. Lambert Caron... He's not here just to sell his house. He thinks it's your fault the lighthouse light was off. Did you drink that night? What do you want? Has he turned your head? Florelle's son, Tristan... Is he really yours? With whom else could she have had a son? She ran an orphanage. She could have adopted a child. I'm telling the truth. Think what you like. Can you move that? Oh, sorry. Has Théo a computer? He hasn't even got a phone. I never saw him here, when he was a birdman. What are you sending? The birds' passage: time, date, place. Théo sent it by post. They compared like that. Have you always done this or have you had other jobs? I haven't always done this. - Hello. - Hello. The blue ones. Three packets, please. That's 18.30 euros. You have nice hands. May I? I can read palms. Your heart line joins your fate line. That's very good. You're lucky in love. Starting from when? Right now. I didn't see your life line. Enough of your nonsense. I'm sorry. How much do I owe for the glasses? Forget it. Take a seat. It's on me. No. I prefer to pay. Any buyers yet? I think I'll use an agent. I know someone who wants a house. Yours would be perfect. At 170,000. We'll see. Shall I tell him before you get an agent? OK. Right. Milloraine, anything else? No, thanks. Mayonnaise? It's crab. I don't eat that. Sorry. It's the daily special. All we've got. Never mind. - Are you allergic? - No. But those things eat anything. After 24 years, they're not the same crabs. I'll get you some ham. Forget it. I wasn't hungry anyway. See you. Did I leave a letter in your car? - "A letter"? No. I didn't see one. Here's your jacket. Come in. Know who I thought you were? - No. Who? - Florelle. She comes every day. Stands there. They've all been dead over 40 years. And she's still mourning. And you, 25 years. It's scary. I hope it's not always like that. Have you lost someone too? We should start a club: you, Florelle, me. I don't think she takes you for one of the drowned. Rather, for her son. She had a son? Really? The poor boy, he can't have had much fun. They say he left 15 years ago. She still hopes he'll come back. Then you turn up from nowhere. I'd rather be taken for a living man than a dead one. Something wrong? Everything's fine. I promised to visit Florelle. I like her. Right. You like Théo too. May... May I? When it rained, my mother used to make us draw. It rained a lot. She did this one for Paul. Even the toy monkey was on that boat. Only I was left behind. See this? The year of 27 shipwrecks. This wood's from a boat that sank that year. I told Théo you'd go and see him. Want to come with me? It's you who needs to hear what he has to say. We could go out, no? Shall we go for a walk? To the cliffs, then. For my observations. You don't lock the door? No, we never did. There's nothing to steal. Were your parents hippies? Why do you ask? House left open, going about naked. How do you know that? I have powers. I heard Lili call you Milloraine. Yes. No idea who she is. A sort of fairy who hides in the trees. Rather cool. Unless you talk to her. She can turn nasty. It takes 8 years to tame her. Or else she brings death. But that's... It's just a legend. So it's here you watch the birds? Here and further on. And you're paid for it? Paid and housed. It's in my contract. That's what I wanted. Do you think you'll manage to move on one day? Who says I need to move on? You see, I have powers too. Florelle? What are you doing here? Come on in. Through the dormitory. Here. This way. Come on. Come up. What are you doing? It's dangerous. I'm unblocking the gutter filters. Come down, you'll hurt yourself. I haven't finished. Now the other filter's blocked. Come down. There. The birds making nests drop twigs, which block the gutters. Give me the brush. I'll try. Sorry. Thanks. Where are the children? What do they do with their pyjamas? Every day, it's the same thing. Yet I always tell them. A place for everything, and everything in its place. Come. Let's go down, OK? Yes. They'll drown. They mustn't drown. Where are the children? How long is it since you saw your son? Tristan. You think Lambert is him, don't you? He comes to see her, I'm sure. Who? Lili, the thief. She took my son. She took him away, and won't let him see me. But... sometimes he's here. I feel it. Yes. A big fight in there. Wait till it's over. He's been shouting all day... - He's messed you about enough. - Go and see his father. No? You make me sick! He messed you up, and you want more. Is that it? So did you screw the crab, then? Morgane! Well? You went to the cliffs yesterday. And I saw what time he got home... For once there's a cute guy around. Go for it. Or you'll end up like her. Fancy that? You didn't hear me? You're here? Why didn't you come in? Tristan, that's the best thing you can do. Call me when you're in Cherbourg. OK. I'm not 10. Have I ever run into problems yet? ...sea moderate to rough. For Tyne and Dogger, wind north-west, force 4 to 5... There's no shame in taking medicine for your nerves. Would you make a fuss about it? Nice radio, but what's all this? It's either that or the BBC. And as the war's over... ... Fisher tomorrow afternoon, rough sea, smoother to the east. I went to Florelle's. You go to Florelle's? You know she thinks Lambert's her son? She hasn't seen him for so long. But if Lambert and Tristan both went to see her together, she'd get things straight. It's hard that Tristan never sees her. Do you go to see your parents? She's getting on my nerves, giving me lessons. You could just give her his news. Is it my business? Do you give news to the woman looking for you? Want me to do it? No. Don't bother. I'll do it. I'd like to see you again. We can have dinner, if you like. OK. But not here. I'm going away. Not sure when I'm back. Look after the till. No goofing off. What's up? What's going on? Is the girl ill? No, don't worry. She's fine. Just busy. Have you heard her idea? Put those boxes down and go. The madwoman thinks Caron is Tristan. Don't talk about her like that. She wants to take them both to her. You don't care, do you? But how can I get the idea out of my head? How can I get rid of Caron? Tell me that. - Send that one to me. - I won't see her again. I'm talking about Caron! Say I want to see him. To tell him what? What he wants to hear. Go on. I know what you're thinking. But right now, it suits me. Mind if I smoke? No. The nurse called me that night to tell me that... Peter was dead. and that you were gone. I spent all night trying to call you. We feared the worst. Do you see? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to worry you. I didn't come to put you on trial. Though I wish he'd died without help. He asked me to help. It was the last thing we could do together. Thanks to the letters, the ones you still write to him, I found you. He made a will, and there are some things for you. I want nothing. Nothing at all. Remember when... when Peter fell ill and... you told me you felt responsible for his illness? Well, in fact... Peter knew he was ill when you met. He'd known for years. I didn't know either. He hid it from everyone. Dr Wisniak told me that, at the funeral. Until then he'd respected confidentiality. I think you needed to know that. Louise? It's Lambert. I don't know if I can make it. Théo asked to see me, and it might take a while. Anyone home? Théo! Come in. I want to talk. Come in and close the door. Want a drink? I didn't come for that. but you'll need one. What's that? Just a sparrow. What do you have to say? The light wasn't broken that night. I turned it out. Your parents and brother died because of me. You had the right to know. It's time to move on now. Why did you do that? So the birds wouldn't crash into it. They made such a terrible noise. - Maddening. - What are you playing at? What are you up to? - Stop it! - What? I've waited so long. Go on, kill me! Hit me. Go on, hit me. You bastard! Fuck! What are you doing here? So the lighthouse wasn't out of order? What kind of birds got crushed? You piss me off. Clear off. Don't talk to me like that. Geese. It was geese. Are you happy? Then clear off. Hello. I saw a light. - Come in. - Thanks. What happened? Nothing. In Cherbourg, I fought with some guys in a bar. What guys? What? Er... Skinheads or something. They called me a bastard, and that set things off. A drink? No, thanks. The state of them afterwards... It wasn't just their hands that were sore. - What? - No, sorry. I thought you were going to Théo's. Yes. But in fact, he was asleep. He must have been drunk. I'm off to Cherbourg tomorrow to the bird centre. I can drop you there if you want. Then you can see a doctor. No, thanks. I'm fine. If they broke a bottle on you, it might be infected. Thanks. You read it? I called the woman who's looking for you. I had to tell you. In memory of Paul Caron 25 May 1986 - 4 February 1988 Lost at sea 4 February 1988 4 February 88 Brent goose Red breasted goose Quentin? Could the brent geese of La Hague, in 1988, have migrated in February? No. February is too early. They migrate in March. See, it was in March, as usual. There were 430 of them. Do other birds migrate in February? No. It's much too early. You've reached Dr Lambert Caron's voicemail. I'm not here. You can leave a message, or in an emergency, call Dr Guichou on 06 77 54 32 12. Thank you. Hello? Hello, it's Lambert. You called me? I have to talk to you. Can we meet tonight? That'll be difficult. I'm leaving for the Jura soon. Hello? You still there? Yes. Look, I don't mind about you calling Allison. I understand. And at least you told me. I can be in Auderville in 30 min. Wait for me? It's really important. I can give you 30 seconds only. What are you playing at? First the letter, then Allison, now I find you're a doctor. Why hide that from me too? Because you don't like doctors. I wanted to talk to you. I called Allison to understand. I wanted to know why you had that blockage. She kindly answered most of my questions. But I'm afraid I can't compete with a dead man. You won't have to. I have something to tell you too. I was at Théo's when you came there. He didn't know I was there. There were no migrating birds, the night of the shipwreck. I came to the office to check. Théo lied to you. Why do that? I don't understand. I don't know. I can ask him tomorrow, if you want. You're not leaving, then? You really think Pierrick suits me better than Lambert? Guess who's visiting the house tomorrow. Who? The sailor I fought with at Lili's. Remember? She called to ask. I nearly said no, then... Now I don't really care. I must get rid of the house. I can't stand it. The sailor's called Tristan. He's the son of Florelle and Théo. The one Florelle confused you with. You OK? Shall I take it off? No way. Keep it on. Excuse me. I can't sleep. Peter... When you said you helped him jump into the volcano, did you disconnect him? He asked me to do it. I did it out of love. So his death would be his. Now I feel like I was manipulated. If you hadn't done it, the doctors would have. I've had to take part in that kind of decision. But it wasn't for you wife. I can't believe he asked me to do that. It's horrible. Suffering's not an excuse for everything. Jacques Prévert Stories "The lighthouse keeper loves birds too much. "Thousands of birds fly to the light. "Thousands are blinded, thousands knocked out. "Thousands die. "The keeper cannot stand such things. "He loves birds too much. "So he says: 'Too bad.' "And turns the light out." I could have talked like that, but he wouldn't have understood. Why did you lie to him? You didn't want to admit you were drunk? You prefer to be taken for a criminal? Is that your pride? She's understood. Look at her. She's happy. Right? Take it back. It's pissing me off. Tristan... Florelle! Are you OK? I didn't see the hole. It hurts. Keep still. I'll call an ambulance. Shall I tell Théo? Don't be angry about that incident. Théo's my father. I can't stand him, but I can't bear to hear him slandered. How long have you owned it? Always. It was the family house. The bedrooms are upstairs. If you don't mind my asking, why are you selling? I live in the Jura, a long way away. I'll let you look round. I think your mother confuses me with you. You know my mother? When we first met, she called me Tristan. Her brother's name. She never got over his death. When I was born she gave me his name. And confused us. She's a little unbalanced, you noticed? Paul 25-09-1986 You must wait. Her husband should be coming. Is this your medallion? Yes. Impossible. Where did you find it, Florelle? The little boy who wore it. What happened to him? I want to see Tristan. You have me, it's not so bad. Give me your hand. All this was always here? Yes, always. How old are you? 27. Come in. Hello. Can I have a word? Excuse me. Strange, I had the same one. It belonged to my little brother, Paul. Let's go out. Florelle couldn't have children. This boy wasn't like the others. He came from the sea. Why didn't you say anything? I was 15. Could I denounce my father? The light was broken that night. He went to get a new lamp. That's how he found your brother in a dinghy and brought him to Florelle. Do you think I enjoyed... keeping the secret all this time? But why didn't you tell Tristan either? I was often tempted to. It would have relieved me. But it wouldn't have been kind to do that. I did what I could. I loved him, I helped him. I stayed here so he could leave. So he wouldn't have all this baggage. But you see, he's fragile. If you tell him now, you'll destroy him. One day maybe he'll work it out for himself. That's why I proposed your house. So he wouldn't lose his inheritance. I'll protect him. Please! Will you tell him? I don't see what else I can do. But I won't remove the plaque. And you? What will you do? I'll carry on. I like what I do, you know. It's not a punishment. Do you think you could carry on in the Jura? Come. It's vague, but... I remember once, in the lounge, you hurt your chin. Subtitles: Eclair Media
