The rule of the Beiyang Government was a dark age. Warlords dominated and society was in chaos. Consortiums, bandits, and arms dealers dictated the world. However, there was a group of individuals who fought for justice. They believed that justice would finally defeat evil. (Taiping Town) Does anyone want to raise the bid? Yes! I'll raise it by 10,000. - Is he insane? - 42,000 in total. You've raised your own bid. Can't I? Of course you can. But I need to make things clear. Is this your first time here? Let me explain the rules to you. We only sell virgins under 16 years old. All my guests here have wealth and status. If someone messes up the bidding and ruin everyone's good cheer, I won't show any mercy. So, you're the boss here. Don't worry. I never go back on my word. I get the girl. You get the money. Deal. - Guards. - Yes. Escort this girl to his home and receive payment. Yes. Hold on. Having second thoughts? Not yet. I doubt she's worth this much. 42,000. I want you. You can't afford me. Don't be hasty with your reply. Money isn't a problem. I have a family heirloom. It's priceless. Look at this. Is it enough? He's a police officer! I'm worried it doesn't fit me. - Stop him. - Yes! Big Head! - Big Head, you're late. - I tried my best. - Ask them to hurry up. - Move it. - Sir! - Sir! Save the ladies first. Yes, sir! Hurry up! Come on! Get in! Move! Come up! Why should I? So that you can arrest me? My hand is slipping. You saved me today. I'll pay this debt of gratitude. You can't afford me. What were you going to do? Hit me? I wouldn't bear to do that. Fess up. Where were you fooling around last night? Last night? I was on a case. I saved dozens of girls. Saving people? You didn't have to get so chummy with them. You reek of perfume. I'm frustrated too. The procuress I met last night knew martial arts. She almost killed me. When Big Head and Yang Xu carried you back last night, you were out like a dead pig! I know that you're worried about me. I'm fine. Don't worry. Stop it. This is serious. Ask Captain Zhang to keep you off such dangerous cases. Sure, I'll ask him. Got it, come on. What are you doing? Don't move. Let's see if our son is kicking you. Silly, it's too early to hear anything. Hush. Who's calling? Pick it up. Hello? You're up? Captain Zhang. Are you good? Thanks for your concern. I'm fine now. - I'm asking if you're good for later. - Yeah, I'm free. Drop by the station. - Now? - Yes, right away. Okay. - Who was that? - Captain Zhang. What's wrong? There may be something urgent at the station. I have to go now. This early? Have your breakfast first. I'm tight on time. How about you resign? You're overworked for just 18 bucks a month. I have no choice. The police have to be ever ready. I'm off. Hold on. Take this to the station and eat it while it's still hot. Cold food is bad for your stomach. I'll come back for dinner tonight. Don't be late. Okay. (Jiang City Police Station) Release them right away! Yes, sir. - Hurry up. - Yes, sir. Don't worry, I'm on it. Let them go. What? Let them go! Wait. Our efforts last night would be in vain. Can I defy the chief? Three of you, leave. In a bad mood? Like hell I can be upset. You're the captain. You call the shots. I'm the captain. But that doesn't mean anything. Take it easy. If you didn't take a bullet for me, you wouldn't be the captain. You're damn right. I really want to quit. Bring me some water. Hurry up. I need to discuss something with you. What is it? The invitation last night cost me $1,000. I can't afford that. You needn't pay. Do you know how much dirty money we seized yesterday? How much? 100,000. That's hefty! Who did it belong to? Tian Long. Master. I've only heard about this man recently. From what I know, all the black markets in Jiang City... That includes the human trafficking market you raided last night. It's likely that everything belongs to him. Don't the top brass care? Them? Too many officials have accepted his bribes. Their relationships are probably complicated. Is he that much of a bigwig? That's not all. I even heard that he has four formidable fighters working for him. All of them were saved by him. They're utterly devoted to him. Commander Gao. A sharp shooter. He's in charge of arms sales. A failed warlord. Liu Yidao. He's in charge of opium transactions. Assassination is his forte. Many people who rejected Tian Long's offers went missing. He's probably responsible for that. One of them is called Ruan Linglong. She's likely the one you fought last night. You've never made a mistake. If the goods are lost, it's no big deal. If our reputation is tarnished, we would be left with nothing. Got it? Yes. There's just one among these four that I just can't get information on. Word is going around. Tian Long is the only exception. Everyone who has met him and knows about his identity is dead. I want to eliminate Tian Long. Hold your horses. My dear Captain Zhang. Please don't get me involved again. I'm a mere officer with a meager pay of $18 a month. Wanjing is also pregnant. Get lost. Excuse me, this is my office. Fine, I'll leave. Captain Zhang. Why are you pissed off? Just to be clear, I won't spare any troublemakers in Jiang City. You need to stop causing trouble for me. By the way, come to my office later. I have bird's nest for Wanjing. Who gave that to you? Hey, do you want it or not? Of course. Why not? Screw you. - Captain. - What's wrong? We received information on an opium trade tonight. Got it. What's going on? We have work to do. Be careful. Here. Come on. Hurry up. Be quick. Load up the goods. Hurry up! Follow me! Follow me! Hurry up! Don't move. Squat down. Freeze! Don't move! Stay still! Squat down! Officer, what's the matter? What are inside these? Some... medicinal herbs. Open them. Officer, these goods have been checked at the port. Well, I have to check them again. Officer, please... Please don't open it. Well... Officer. This is my master's gift for you. Your master sure is generous. Who is he? Tian Long. I appreciate his kindness. As for the goods... Seize them. What a law-abiding police officer. You might've missed my words. My master is Tian Long. If no one obeys the laws, what's the point of establishing them? As for Tian Long, I have no clue who he is. - Big Head! - Yes, sir! - Arrest him. - Yes, sir! Hold on. Do you have the guts to reveal your name? Yao Tingsen of Jiang City Police Station. Any questions? None at all. You can take the goods. But... You'll have to bear the consequences. If you have any problems, feel free to come looking for me. Take him away. Move. Got it. Brother Sen, Chief Zhou wants us to bring the goods back. What? That won't do. We'd better follow orders or it'd be hard to tie up this case. - Zhao Yuan. - Yes, sir. - Bring the gasoline here. - Yes, sir. Burn everything. Are you sure that's what he said? Yes, I'm sure. He said his name was Yao Tingsen. Bring Liu Yidao here. Yes. Big Head, come on. Fill your cup. Bottoms up! Nice! Fill your cups! Are we still drinking? Cheers! Come on! Cheers! Who's there? I'm here to deliver a document from the police station. It's so late. Coming! Brother Sen, it's late. We'll get going. Let's go. Why are you trying to slip off? I'm not. Come on. Be careful. Watch your step. Why are you so cheeky even when we're drinking? Big Head, be a little decent. Listen up. When we go drinking again, meet my standards. We're brothers. Between brothers... - Big Head! - Feels great! Big Head, why did you head get bigger? We're just drinking. Why can't you be more decent? Where are you guys going? Come to my house. We can drink more. Sure! Okay! None of you are leaving. Big Head. Big Head! You always drink so little. - Why is your head getting even bigger? - Let's go drinking again. You can't cheat next time. Yes, sir. I won't. - I'm home. - You're home. Look, my wife even left the door open for me. Be careful, Brother Sen. All right, you can go home. Brother Sen, let me... Wanjing. Wanjing! Wanjing! Wanjing! Wanjing! Wanjing. Wanjing. I'm fine. Don't worry. Stop it. What's going on? Captain Zhang was taken away by Chief Zhou's men this morning. Taken away? Why? He's been confined for an investigation. Darling. Wait for me to return. Sergeant. Let's go. - Master. - What's the matter? Some cops are here. Get Housekeeper Wang to send them away. How about I do it? They're good fighters. I'm worried that Housekeeper Wang... Are you worried about him or someone else? Let Housekeeper Wang go. If that loser is killed by the cops, I'd be grateful. This smell... What's wrong, Brother Sen? Big Head. Wait for me outside. Would you like a hair cut or a shave? I'd like a shave. This way, please. I haven't seen you before. You aren't a local, are you? I'm from Jiang City. Are you a businessman? A small business. Those who visit this place aim for great success. They're either officials or bandits. You're wrong. I'm neither an official nor a bandit. As long as I'm not your target, your identity doesn't matter. You must be joking. Why would I target you? Your soap is fragrant. I make it myself. It must be delicate work. This is my first time encountering such wonderful soap. I make it from camellia oil. It aids in sleeping. What a pity. Even the most fragrant soap can't conceal the smell of tobacco on your hands. Not bad. You've got good moves. Did you kill Wanjing? So, you're that cop. You must be dying to know your wife's last words. She told me she was pregnant. She kneeled and begged. She begged me to spare her for her child. It was so pitiful. Do you want to know whether your wife was pregnant with a son or a daughter? Retreat! Brother Sen, save me. - Brother, save me! - Brother Sen! Move it. Get moving. Master, he's here. Gentlemen, welcome to my place. I can only offer a shoddy greeting. Please pardon me. You've come knocking before I could even invite you over. Did you think this was your turf? Did you send that man to kill my wife? Oh, my sincere apologies for that. I was just praying for her. Anyway, I forgot to tell you this. In my turf, murder is legal. Big Head! - Big Head! - Be quiet. Big Head! Be quiet. We're in a church. I'm your target. This has nothing to do with my comrades. Fine. I can shoot you first. Don't forget that you're killing a police officer. A police officer? The police? In Jiang City, I'm god. Do you think you're the king of Jiang City? Look at him. He's so ignorant. Come here. I'll teach you a lesson today. Most of my enemies in Jiang City are dead. All those who survived and accepted my bribes, their locations, and the amount they accepted are all recorded in here. Want to challenge me? Dream on. Let me go. Please let me go! Look, your subordinate is far more intelligent. Are you afraid of me? He isn't. There are countless fearless ones like him in Jiang City. I really want to free you. But if I break my rules just for you, my honor will be ruined. Sorry. - Let me go! - Don't move! Zhao Yuan! Bye. Zhao Yuan! Zhao Yuan! Zhao Yuan! Bastard! Kill me! Let Brother Sen go! Usually, killing one is adequate as a warning. Too bad, you aren't even worthy of that. I want you to leave this place alive. Report whatever you witnessed to the entire Jiang City. Tell them to obey me. If they don't, this will be their end. Go ahead. Make up for that disgrace. I have a dagger. I heard from Liu Yidao. Your wife was pregnant when she was killed. I'll go a good deed and let you two reunite. Distasteful. I never strike twice to kill. Leave it to me. This man's life is mine. You won't even get a chance. Seems like he's fated to live today. How about we let him go? No, it's taboo to fail in the first strike. I must kill him or misfortune will befall me. Master, lock him up for now. I'll find a good time to kill him tomorrow. Sure. My girl has fallen in love with you. I'll give you two more days to live. Let's enjoy our time. Brother Sen, we almost lost our lives. Don't worry. We'll be able to get out of here. Did you come up with an escape plan? Shut up and move! Move it! Go in. Who's that? Oh, just two kids. You look like gentlemen. You disrupted my sleep. Sorry, I didn't see you. Sorry? Show them how to apologize. What are you doing? Got that? Please calm down. We know the rules. Come in. Master, I'm here. Why didn't you kill him? Master, it was a genuine mistake. Master. Human traffickers sold me to the brothel as a child. I killed my first customer and ended up in jail. My parents were killed for vengeance. Your came to Taiping Town and saved me. You avenged my parents for me. From that moment on, my life was yours. I know that you're a grateful woman. You must remember this. From now on, never lie to me again. Your body belongs to me. Your heart also belongs to me. If there's someone else in your heart, I have no choice but to kill him. I may have to kill you instead. Got it? Yes. Hey, why are you walking about at night? I'm getting some water. Get to bed! Fatty, why are you bringing food over so early? Boss went to Jiang City. It'd be a waste to throw out so much leftovers. Brother Sen. Send it in quickly. Time to eat. Brother Wu. You're new here? Yes. This is yours. Brother Sen, eat up. Eating will give us the energy to flee. I've been here for ages, but I've never had such a feast. We owe you our thanks. This may just be your last meal. Enjoy. You won't die tonight. (Coming at 03:00. Linglong) Everything is ready as per your orders. Leave Taiping Town tonight and never return. Brother Sen! Brother Sen. My benefactor! Thank you so much! Why am I your benefactor now? That's because you saved my life! It doesn't matter. You should think up an excuse for that murder. Sir, you don't know this. Taiping Prison is unlike other prisons. Most of the prisoners here simply offended Tian Long and his four fighters. In this prison, no one cares about a murder between prisoners. My benefactor, I owe you for saving my life. From now on, my life is yours. Perhaps I'll be dead tomorrow. I doubt so. Captain, you're back. Where are the others? I'm the only one on duty tonight. Everyone else went home. I don't care if you call them or knock on their doors. I want you to gather everyone at the police station. Right now, move it! Yes, sir. Come on. Get in! Come on! Done. - I know about a back door. Follow me. Come on. Screw you! Son of a bitch! You almost shot me! Why are you here? Are you insane? A gunshot will alert others! - But he... - What should we do? Commander Gao is in charge of Taiping Town's security. Unlike me, he isn't a guy to be reckoned with. We'll be caught once he arrives. Follow me. Come on. Let's go. Commander, the prisoners have escaped. What? Get them. Move it! After them! Hurry up! Make way! Out of the way! Move it! Get them! Listen up. Let's split up. We'll meet at the South Gate. You go with Yang Xu. Sure. Let's go. You lied to them. You don't plan on leaving, do you? I came here to kill Tian Long. I'm not leaving until I kill him. I don't want to sacrifice another comrade either. As long as I'm here, I won't let you do it. You aren't a match for Tian Long. I told you, I'm not leaving until I get revenge. If I knew you'd do this, I wouldn't have saved you. Fine, let's fight. You can go ahead if you win. If you lose, you have to leave Taiping Town. Sure, let's do it. Watch out! Get them! Stop! Stop! Stop running! Yang Xu. Yang Xu! Yang Xu! Sir. H-He... Yang Xu. Tingsen, what happened? Where are the others? They're dead. Dead? Chief Zhou released me in the middle of the night. I rushed here with everyone immediately. Yang Xu. Did you lead Captain Zhang here? I got separated from him. I kept running out of the town and met this officer. He told me that you're acquainted, so I brought him here. That means you just arrived at Taiping Town. Sorry, Tingsen. I was too late. Well, why... is this here? You killed Yang Xu. Answer me! Why did you kill Yang Xu? Why? He only has himself to blame. Yang Xu! Captain Zhang, why are you here? I rushed over with everyone to save you once Chief Zhou released me. What's going on here? Ting Long was killed when he tried to resist. By the way, where's Tingsen? He's trapped by Commander Gao. - Hurry up and lead me there. - Okay. Hold on. Tian Long mentioned a notebook with the names of the people he bribed. - Where is it? - I know where it is. I'll get it. Got it. Thank you, buddy. Without you, I would've never known about this notebook. Thank you. You've already taken the notebook. Why did you come back? Are you here to mock me? Perhaps you're here to kill me and cover up your crimes! No. We're brothers who grew up together. I'd never kill you. Shut up! I'm not your brother! If we were, you wouldn't have manipulated me to kill Tian Long. If we were brothers, how could you shoot a colleague who worked with you for over a decade? If we were brothers, how could you trample over the country's laws? Tingsen. I have my reasons. Tian Long. He rose from a punk to a master of all these luxuries. I helped him gain everything! Now that he has the world, he has started to scorn me. I can be honest with you. I have a share in all of Tian Long's businesses. Things have changed now. Tian Long is dead. I own everything now. No, not mine. It's ours. What do you want? What about Wanjing? Wanjing wasn't part of my plans. It was an accident. She was pregnant! Stop! Put your guns down! Put them down! Tingsen, wake up. I can shoot you, but I'm not doing so. Do you know why? That guy is dead. I have the notebook. Do you know what this means? I'm no longer a puny captain. I can easily become the chief. Even the mayor. I can make up for Wanjing's passing. What else do you want? Money? I can give you half of Tian Long's businesses. If you want to be an official, I can buy you whatever title I'm holding. Oh, I get it. You want women. I can get you ten wives if that's what you desire. Even 20. If you want a 100, you can have that. How did you end up like this? No matter who I've become, you'll always be my brother. My brothers are dead. Let me introduce him. He's the leader of the four fighters, Sun Wu. I asked him to serve Tian Long because I was worried that Tian Long would betray me. Actually, I got him to help you in the prison. It's a real pity now. Kill Tingsen and everything I promised him will be yours. Hurry up! Let's go. - Get them. - Move it. Hurry. Hurry! I'll hold him back! You can deal with those cops! Okay! Shoot! Big Head! Big Head! Big Head! Are we still drinking? Come on! Cheers! I told you. Your life... is mine. Is it really worth going to such extremes? Do I have any other choice?
