[Wind Whistling] - [Dutch] Well? - How much is there? Three hundred. - Did you like them? - Yes. Two thirds. One third. Okay, let's take half. ??[Techno] [Yelling] ??[Continues] ??[Continues] ??[Continues] ??[Continues] ??[Continues] ??[Continues] ??[Continues] ??[Ends] Hugo. Hmm? - About saying good-bye. - Hmm. It bothers me that we never see them again. Does it? Yeah. Cut the crap, Goof. Let's get down to work. - ??[Techno] - [No Audible Dialogue] [No Audible Dialogue] - ??[Continues] - [No Audible Dialogue] ??[Ends] Wait out here. - [English] Excuse me. Can we ask you something? - Yeah, sure. We're looking for a coffee shop. Do you know where that is? - "Sodom." Yeah, I know it. - Yeah? - I can take you there if you want. - Oh, yes. [German] Are you crazy? You don't know him. - [English] No, I don't think so. - It's no problem. [Speaks German] [English] We just have to wait for my friend. He'll be right back. [Speaking German] [Dutch] My name is Goof. - Beate. - [English] Ah, look, there he is. Hi, girls. Wanna fuck? [Dutch] What are you doing? I finally make contact by myself, and you come along and ruin it. Ruin it? I just saved you. Airheads like that hang out at McDonald's. Besides, we've already had Swedes. They were German. Come on, smart-ass. What were you doing? You'll see tonight. - [English] Happy? - ??[Techno] [No Audible Dialogue] [Chattering, Indistinct] Be subtle, Goof. Staring like some moron will only scare them off. - Take a different approach. - Like what? Yeah. Try to look more out of the corner of your eye. Right. Now step back. - [Bicycle Bell Ringing] - A little further. - [Grunting] - [Goof] Sorry. - That's just like you. - Why didn't you tell me? [Hugo In English] I'm so sorry. You know, he's a bit of a dreamer. - Where are you from? - Italia. Sure you didn't hurt yourself? Just a little bit, you know, but - Be careful. Amsterdam's a dangerous place, you know. Yeah. And I'm afraid we are not used to bicycles. That's okay. It was Goof s fault anyway. - Oh, this is where you're staying? - Yeah. Would you like to drink something in the lobby with us? - [Exhales, Coughs] - So, here is it. It's nice, huh? Wow. Freddy's Peace Hotel. [Chuckles] - Hi. - Hi. [Dutch] Hey, Goof. Look over there. Isn't that the chick from last week, Heidi or something? I don't think so. Well, I was wrong. Why do you always get the cutest one? Natural selection. It's not my doing. It's God's. - You said God doesn't exist, only you. - No. I said, "There's just the I." In your case, that's you. - [Italian] Wanna smoke, Kika baby? - Yeah. Thanks, Freddy. - Angela? - Yes, please. - [Dutch] You two? - No, thanks. Do you have black currant soda? Black currant soda? I don't sell that stuff. It's for wimps. - [English] Who is that guy? - He's Freddy. He owns this place. - You know him? - Everybody knows Freddy. He's so cool. Did you know he met the Beatles in Pakistan? [Dutch] Still, you did a shitty thing. You shouldn'tjudge a book by its cover. That's a form of racism, you know. Every individual is interesting. Every woman has something characteristic and unique about her... whether she's beautiful or ugly. - Then you take the fat one. - No, she prefers you. You have to respect that. Sit down next to her. Go on. [English] What's this all about? [Dutch] Nothing. Blob. [English] More close to him, please. Smile. [Chuckling] [Chattering, Indistinct] - Mamma mia. - [Sniffing] [Groans] Psst. Goof. What are you waiting for? She's sweet. - That blob? - She's not a blob. She's beautiful. Don't get sentimental on me. Rip it out. Not that much. They were nice. Mine wasn't that nice. - Take her money then. - That's what I'm doing. - Stick to the rules. - Look who's talking. That's what I'm doing, but you keep changing them! It's called dialectics, Goof. Thesis, antithesis, synthesis. It's not fair. Angela doesn't have much money and hates her job in Turin. That's her problem. Where's the fucking camera? Where's the camera? - [Yelling] - Shh! - [Angela] Kika.! - [English] Bye! Goof! - [Shouting, Indistinct] - Hey! [Yells] [Freddy Shouting, Indistinct] Hey.! [Freddy Shouting, Indistinct] - Sissy! Are you in this or not? - Sorry! - This bullshit doesn't do us any good. - Sorry! Now those bitches even have a picture of me. So it works out better if we steal all the money? Of course. The shittier we are to them, the better it works. You told me yourself you only fall in love when there's some hope. Try to understand that there's no use falling in love. Don't give in to your feelings. You have to draw the line somewhere. If we steal everything, there's no way back. So why don't we steal their credit cards as well? No. We can't do that. It's against the law. [Cell Phone Ringing] Hello? I'd just fallen asleep. - I told you I work night shifts. - [Goof Chuckling] Shut up, Goof. - I didn't say anything. - See? No, that was Goof, bullshitting as usual. Mom, I'm going back to sleep. Yeah. Love you too. Bye. - What was in that bottle? - What bottle? - You stuck it up your nose. - It was for my cold. No, those are poppers, stupid. It's for sex. It gives me that last boost. - Is it the train from Cologne or Paris? - Paris. - Paris. - ?Paris, here we come ?? - So you're impotent. - No, but it makes coming much better. Would I like it too? They say it kills brain cells. You're short of those already, so - [English] Hey, looking for a place to stay? Freddy's Peace Hotel. Best place in town. [German] Listen up. Freddy's Peace Hotel. Pot smokers' paradise. [Dutch] Fuck off, man! ??[Techno] [No Audible Dialogue] [No Audible Dialogue] ??[Continues] - ??[Ends] - [No Audible Dialogue] You think it's hers? [English] Excuse me. Did you just arrive from Paris? Yeah. Why? We just came in at the last stop, and we found this bag. - And we thought it might be yours. - Oh, no. I'm sorry. I have all my stuff. - [Dutch] Let's take it to lost and found. - But what a waste. - [English] Look. It's nice stuff. - You sure it isn't yours? No, I'm positive. Oh, thank you. - Hey, Lara, is that your bag? - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. [Chuckles] Okay. Please accept it. Finder's fee. Ah, thank you. Oh, look, Hugo. It's real French wine... from the Albert Heijn. [Chuckling] [No Audible Dialogue] [Dutch] Shit! [English] I'm sorry. I forgot all about it. We have to catch a train. We're changing trains. So, sorry. [Dutch] Beat it. [English] Okay, sorry, girls. Enjoy Amsterdam. Hey, you know Freddy's Peace Hotel? It's really cool. [Dutch] Blob. Come on, now. What are you doing? Where are we going? - I want my bag back. - What? - Are you crazy? - Relax, man. - [English] Hey. - I knew a shortcut. - A very short cut. - So what happened to your train? - Missed it. - Almost as much as we missed you. - [Chuckling] - [Woman] Damrak, Dam-Damrak? [Hugo] Yeah, Damrak. That's the street that's connected to the Dam Square. And, uh, well, you know, this is the place where all the junkies live. Oh. Oh, I heard about this place. Is this a good place to stay? Oh, no. No, that sucks. Hey, Goof. They wanna go to Freddy's Peace Hotel. Oh, no, no. No, sorry. You can't go there. - Why not? - Only tourists go to Freddy's. I heard that the owner actually met the Beatles in Pakistan. Yeah, why do you think they ran off to India, huh? Okay, forget it. Go someplace else. [Goof] Shall we go for something really, really expensive? [Hugo] Okay, Goof. Now we're talking. [Hugo] You can draw out some money... because in Dutch restaurants they hardly accept credit cards. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Well, how much do you think I should get? Well, 500 guilders will get you through dinner. Okay. Well, I'll get a thousand then. - How do you like it? - It's okay. Okay. Get in. Closer. Tighter. Cheese. - [Hugo Laughing] - Come on, Lara. You can't even smile? Do you want some wine? - No. - No, thanks. [Dutch] Isn't it nice of Kristy to pay? I think I'll try the lobster. - [English] Good thinking. - What are you guys thinking? Uh, I think you can pay with a credit card. Oh, would you just stop worrying about money? So do you know what you guys are getting? Mm-hmm. - [Hugo] Cheers. - [Kristy] Cheers. To my new friends. - Welcome to Amsterdam. - Thank you. How do you like Holland? I don't know. I just arrived. Hmm. First impression? I don't have first impressions. - But it's fun. - Hugo. - [Dutch] Not now, Goof. - Sorry. Could you say something to her? I can't get a conversation going. Maybe some other time, okay? - Sorry. Bye. - Bye. [English] You know, you have this, uh, this road there - Here. That should cover everything and dessert too, if you want it. So, uh, just try and stay out for a few hours, okay? And when you do come back, just make sure that you knock first. - Okay? You understand? - No. Okay? Thank you. Bye. So, where are you from? [Shutter Clicks] Jesus! What the fuck are you doing here? [Dutch] Hey, moron! What's that bitch doing here? It's Lara. - She's from Siberia. - I don't care where she's from. We agreed not to bring any girls here. I hope you realize I just stole her friend's identity... not to mention her liquid assets. I can't believe what a jerk you are! Now she knows who we are, what we do and where we live. You got us into trouble. - You clean up this mess. - Why? You robbed Kristy. I didn't. ? We're gonna take a break now ? ??[Techno] ? We're gonna take a break now ? ? We're gonna take a break now ?? ??[Ends] [Cell Phone Ringing] Hello? No, Mom. I can't talk now. This is a bad time. No, I've switched to day shifts. Bad timing again. Yes. I'll call you back later. Hugo? [English] Yeah, I go. Are you leaving? My boss just called, and I really have to go to work. Thanks for everything. Have a nice day. Wait, wait. I wanted to give you my number in case you ever come to New York. - Where's my bag? - Your what? - My bag. - Oh, you don't need your bag. You just whisper your address in my ear. - I have a perfect memory. - [Chuckles] Welcome to Amsterdam, Miss Siberia. Kristy left. Uh, she had a call from her daddy, and it was an emergency. She had to go to the United States. So I took your bag. Oh. Thank you. You're welcome. What happened to my other bag? Your other bag? Kristy took it. Sorry. [Dutch] Too bad, huh? [Dutch] I don't mind paying the rent, but you could do some shopping. - [English] What is this, chocolate? - No, it's caviar. - They call it hagelslag. - [No Audible Dialogue] [Dutch] If Kristy wasn't in town, I'd kick this bitch out right now. [English] I hope she dies in an airplane crash. I'm glad she's gone. Yeah. Sometimes a person who seems like a friend can be opposite. Never trust a person who calls himself a friend. - What are you talking about? - Kristy, the American girl. - I thought she was your friend. - No. She's your friend. - You slept with her. - [Chuckles] [Dutch] You hear that, Goof? - We could kick her out now. - Shut up. [English] Yeah, I met her in the train, and for one hour she was my best friend. But that was of course before she met her fuckboy. [Dutch] So what's it like to fuck someone from Siberia? I don't know. - Didn't you try? - Of course not. - So what did you do? - We talked. What a waste of time. That's what you think, Fuckboy. See? She understands Dutch. Hey, cunt. Do you understand Dutch? - [English] Why is he shouting at me? - Do you understand Dutch? No. But I understand "fuckboy." - Is that a Dutch word? - Yeah, "fuckboy" is Dutch word. [Dutch] And so is "get lost." [English] Fuckboy's angry? No, Fuckboy tired. ??[Techno] [Yells] Hey, hey, hey. Hu- Oh, sorry. He's being very boring. - I know. - He can't dance. - [Dutch] She says you're boring. And a terrible dancer. - Yeah. - ??[Continues] - [No Audible Dialogue] [Lara Laughing] Tell me more about Siberia. Why? I told you about Sassenheim. What do you want to know? I don't know. What's it like? - Everybody knows what it is like. - I don't know. - Come on. Tell me. - There are many wolves in Siberia. - And they have big teeth like this. - [Chuckling] - And many bears. - Bears? It's freezing cold, but when the sun shines... then you forget all about the bad things... and all you see is space. Would you like to go back? - I'm still there. - No, but really. Would you really like to go back? If possible, I would. But it's impossible. I can take you there if you want. How can you take me there? - Hugo. - Hmm? - [Dutch] Lara and I just had a good talk. - That's great. I've finally decided what to do with our money. Again? We'll go to Siberia. The three of us. You, Lara and me. Siberia? Okay, let's do it. That's nice of you. I didn't expect it of you. See? Even I have my strong points. Hey, Lara. [English] Are you serious? No, never. [Dutch] See? It's just bullshit. What do you mean? You've been had again. She doesn't want to go to Siberia. - [English] Isn't that right? - [Dutch] That's not fair. She doesn't even know what you're talking about. Even so, I think it's very revealing. It says a lot about her personality. She's very negative. Listen, Hugo. She really wants to go to Siberia. She just doesn't know it yet. - It's gotta be a surprise. - She doesn't know she wants to go? She knows she wants to go, but not that we'll buy her a ticket. I'm not buying her a ticket. Why would she want to go back? She must be here for a reason. She's really homesick. Yeah, all Russians are, even in Russia. We could split up the money if you don't want to go. Split it up? No way. What are you doing? You think I'm gonna stick around here and watch you ignore one rule after the other? If you want to go to Siberia... you'd better find yourself a job. - Then that's what I'll do. - Go ahead. [English] He doesn't treat me like an idiot. - Sure, he does. - No, he doesn't. Goof, Goof. Stand up for yourself, Goof. Don't rush things, Goof. We'll have enough time for each other in the future. [Door Slams] [No Audible Dialogue] [Dutch] I see married life has already begun. It's really unfair that you don't want to split the money. Listen. We agreed to spend the money together on something that we'd both like. Going to Siberia together is not something we'd both like. Why do you always treat me like a child? Because I hate to see a friend lose his head over some Siberian icebox. Hugo, I'm sick of cheating girls and stealing their money. What's your problem? You don't have to love 'em. Just screw 'em. Listen. I understand if you fall in love now and then. I've been through that myself. But the money belongs to both of us. That's worth something. You can't let a woman ruin that. - I want my money. - Now you should really shut up. Without me, there wouldn't be any. Yeah? You can't do it without me anymore. How was business tonight? You're home early. Where's your new passport page? Okay, you asked for it. What are you doing? - Duplicates. - What are you doing? Hey.! Are you crazy? Don't touch those! You've got nine different nationalities. I've got 11. The first to reach 15 gets all the money. - You'll win, of course. - That's why I suggested it. That's ridiculous! You can't ask me to do that now! Haven't you learned anything? Remember you used to think you couldn't seduce girls? If you really want something, you force yourself to do it. Will above feelings, remember? You're ahead by two. Hang on. You get Kristy. I don't want her. - Then take this one. - No. This one? Here. Now we both have ten. - So I just need five more? - Yeah. And then I take it all. Yeah. And you get nothing. Nothing. Great. - [English] Bye, Lara. I'll see you tonight. - Bye. - Excuse me, can we ask you a question? - Where are you from? - Thessaloniki. - So that means you're from Greece? - Yes. - So you're Greek. - Yes. Something wrong with it? - No, no, no. We just wanted to be sure. - Oh. - Just checking. - [Hugo] We love Greece. - We like Greek people. I always hear such fantastic stories about your country. Yeah, we even have an expression, "making love the Greek way." - Aw. - Could you tell me more about that? No, no, no. Don't listen to him. You know he has a disease? He's obsessed with sex. Yeah, but at least I'm honest about it, Marina. You know, Goof is one of those Don Juans who has a girlfriend waiting for him at home. Do you have a girlfriend, Goof? Isn't that a Greek word, "hypocrite"? Come on, Goof. Tell about Lara. Her name is Lara? Yes. But she's not my girlfriend anymore. Last night she phoned me from Paris. She said she found someone she loves even better. Some guy named Pierre. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah. - You don't have to be sorry. He's just - - How can you be so insensitive? Sorry, Goof. Please tell me about her. Well, she's, uh, very... sensitive. She's Russian, you know, full of feeling. She's very beautiful... a bit like you. I mean, different of course, but her eyes are... are the same. It makes me sad to look in those eyes. It's just too many memories for me. You're a good person, Goof. You know how to feel life. [Camera Shutter Clicks] You forgot to smile. Give it to me. Are you sure it is yours? Kristy must like you a lot to give you her camera. Is it a love souvenir? Yes, it is. But not mine. Yours. No, no. Please. It's too early. Let's not rush things, hmm? I understand. It's the pain of missing her, right? Do you mind if I just... lie next to you with my arms around you? That's okay. ??[Techno] ??[Ends] [Yawning] Hiya. Can I help you? Do you accept French francs? [Speaks French] - Sorry? - I accept everything. - Good. - From you. I'm sorry. I've got to get some new forms. [Freddy Belches] [Dutch] Fuck.! Where did that bastard put those fucking forms? Hey, Lara. - [English] Wake up. - Goof. What are you doing here? - I was taking some fresh air. - [Chuckles] Okay. - Don't you want to come in? - I don't feel welcome. You're okay, but Hugo doesn't want me in the house. I can feel it. - Did he do something to you? - Nothing special. He just doesn't like me. Listen, Lara. It's my house. You're my guest... if Hugo likes it or not. You can stay as long as you want, do you understand me? Thank you for letting me back in the house. Good night. It's okay, Lara. We can wait. Hey, Hugo. Hugo. [Dutch] Did you do something to make Lara feel unwelcome? What? What do you mean? Lara is very sensitive. She says she doesn't feel welcome. - So what did I do? - Nothing. It's just a feeling she has. - Just a feeling? - Yeah. - She's a very- - Sensitive girl. Yeah. By the way, that girl Marina... she wasn't just Greek... but American as well. Two down, three to go. What did she prefer? The Greek or the American way? The French way. Lara. [English] Hey, don't you get it? You wanna play games with me, huh? You're not supposed to be here. Why are you here? I have present for you. Where did you get that? "Watch out. This guy is dangerous. Steal passports and money." Nice. Are you some kind of criminal? What do you do? - Tell me. - Why did you come back? What do you want, Lara? What do you want? I like Goof. I like you. You can't like me. I'm not a nice boy like Goof. I like nice boys. - But I also like fuckboys. - Yeah? What do you like about fuckboys? What do you think? [Footsteps Approaching] [Dutch] Have a nice shower? ??[Techno] [No Audible Dialogue] ??[Continues] ??[Continues] [Hugo Gasping, Panting] [Hugo Panting, Gasping] Strong stuff. You're strong stuff. - What is it? - Poppers. Why do you use this shit? - Poppers. - [Chuckles] Because I need an extra push. Can't you do it yourself then? No. I need help... to fuck an ugly girl like you. Why didn't you say it before? I could have used them too. Lara, don't tell Goof. Friends should tell each other everything. [Snoring] - Oh, God! - What are you doing? - Shh! - What is this idiot passport thing? Nothing. We only take their money. [Lara] Steal money, okay, but destroying passports. - Give me a break. - It's immoral. It's vandalism. - Why do you do that, Goof? - Please be quiet. Do you know how long it takes to get a new one? In Russia it takes months to get a new passport. - I do this for us. - Don't touch me. So I can take you to Siberia. - [Hugo Snoring] - What? - I do this for you. So we can leave. - [Snoring Continues] You destroy passports to take me to Siberia? Yeah. I wanted to surprise you. What about Hugo? Does he want to go? No, he doesn't. That's why we have this competition. I mean, the winner takes all the money. I only need two more. But if you want me to stop, I'll stop. Why? I know you do this for me. Nobody ever loved me that much. [Footsteps Approaching] - [Dutch] Morning, Hugo. Sleep well? - Yeah, fine. - [English] Good morning, Lara. - Good morning. Ow! - What? - My neck. Where? - Here? - Yeah, here. Oh, you're such a sweet boy, Goof. Thank you. [Dutch] Did you really sleep well last night? Why? The cupboard. Didn't the noise bother you? No. I slept like a log. - I was exhausted. - There was no new page. Stupid, huh? I had a great fuck, but I forgot to rip the page from her passport. Too bad. See you. - Yeah? - You should try a little harder. - If you lose, I'll feel sorry for you. - I'm not that pathetic. I'm getting fed up with our bet. - It's so childish. - What are you trying to say? If I win, I don't really need all that money. I'm happy enough with Lara, and in Siberia you don't need much money. - Part of it is yours. - Don't get sentimental. I'm not your mother. Suit yourself. I'll see you tonight. ??[Techno] ??[Continues] [Goof Yelling] ??[Continues] ??[Ends] Stop that. Please. - What's wrong? - I can't stand this. Goof doing this is erotic. He does it to me all night. When I'm just trying to sleep. Frustrated idiot. He loves you, Lara. [Sighs] It's his problem if he's so stupid to love me. Don't talk like that. Why? I can't help he loves me. Maybe it's easy to love you. Don't talk like that. It makes you nervous? No, it makes me sick. Love is not good. It's only for losers like Goof. [Gasping] - No, Lara. No. - Hey. What's your problem? Forget about Goof. He's weak. Men should be strong. Let's take money now, go to Mexico. What about Siberia? Fuck Siberia. I'm not going there because of that sentimental idiot. [Camera Winds] [Camera Winds] [Shutter Clicks] [Shutter Clicks] [Dutch] Isn't she sweet when she's asleep? Too bad she's not worth it. If Lara really likes you, why does she prefer a platonic relationship? You don't get it. Sex actually means something to her. Bullshit. - She's just using you. - You'll never understand, Fuckboy. - Wait! - Yeah? She's a sponger. She doesn't want to go to Siberia. She just wants to drive us apart. Well, she's succeeding. One more to go. Time to score. See you tonight. LARISSA KULESHOV GERMAN CITIZEN Lara. Please tell me. What do I have to do to make you leave? Be nice to me, like Goof. - You want me to be nice to you? - Yeah, try it. Be nice to me. You mean nice... like this? No, like this. - [Hugo Chuckling] - Love souvenir. - [Shutter Clicking] - Here, give me. - [Shutter Clicking] - Yeah. Yeah, okay. You want me to be nice, huh? Nice like Goof? Huh? But Fuckboy can't be nice. Because nice is weak. You don't want me to be weak. You want me to be strong. - [Yells] - Get me strong. Stop it! Hugo! - Nice, huh? - Stop it. - Stop it. - Hold still. - [Speaking, Muffled] - Huh? Stop it! [Grunts, Groans] - Fuck you! I'll kill you! - [Shouts] [Sobbing] I have to go. - I'm causing too much trouble. - Oh, no, no. You're not. I bought you a present. Come on. Open it. Please don't cry. - I love you, Lara. - You cannot love me. You don't know me. [Goof Yelling, Coughing] [Snorting] [Gasps] [Gasping] Lara? Lara? Lara! [Screaming] Hey, Lara. Hey! [Cell Phone Ringing] - [Dutch] Listen, Mom. - Something's wrong with Lara! - She's dead! - What? - I fucked her to death. - What? - I fucked her to death. - Where are you? - Near Oudezijds. Help me. - I'm on my way. - Shall I call the hospital? - No, just stay there and wait for me. - Are you still there? - Yeah, I'm still here. - What happened? - She suddenly turned pale. Her face turned pale. She stopped moving. She just didn't move anymore. She was there. Lara? She's alive. - You idiot! - She's alive! I told you not to trust her! Congratulations, Lara. You win. She wants to see me again. She was just using you. Now she's off to Siberia on her own. Here. This will calm you down. Drink up. What's it like to fuck someone to death? Hey. I'm sorry. We're better off now that she's gone. Now you know what she's worth. You won. No. I needed one more. You got one more. A Russian girl. Too bad about the money, though. Hey, cool it. Get out! I thought we were friends. We were business partners... but our business went bankrupt. [Phone Ringing] Freddy's Peace Hotel. [Hugo Speaking Russian] Yes, one moment. Do you know any Russians in Amsterdam? - [Russian] - [English] Lara? It's me. Fuckboy, what do you want? Take a look outside. More to your left. So, why do you call? To apologize? - I want Goof s money back. - It's not his money. - It's the girls' money. - I want it, Lara. - Then give me my passport back. - I don't have your passport. - The page you ripped off. - I don't have it. - Give me the money back, Lara. - Then come and get it. My friend Freddy is waiting for you. Be happy I didn't tell where you live. - I don't live there anymore. - How come? - Because Goof kicked me out. - Goof is a good boy. - Fuck you, Lara. - Fuck you, Fuckboy. Russian mafia? No, worse. Dutch mafia. [Chuckling] Dutch mafia. [Dutch] Come on, Goof. Open the door. Come on, let me in. Goof. Goof. Open up. [Hugo's Voice] Isn't she sweet when she's asleep? Too bad she's not worth it.

No! Wait. I - I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. About Siberia and all that. - That shit with Lara. - What shit with Lara? Well... Lara. I know her kind. - I know that if- - What do you know? Come on, let's go out and have fun like we used to. All right? What's the use of staying locked up all day? - Goof? - Cut it out. - You just want to fuck around. - Goddamn! That's enough! Don't you understand she's still here? She's not waiting for you in Siberia.! She's still here in Amsterdam at Freddy's Peace Hotel... hanging out with Freddy. She doesn't care about you! We're gonna get our money back. But this time I set the rules. Lara. It's me, Goof. No, no, no, Lara, please. Come on. Don't hang up. I'd like to see you again. Well, still wanna go to Siberia? [Hugo] Why don't wejust rob a bank instead? Don't tell me you're afraid of an old hippie. They're the most dangerous of all. Ah! [Groaning] [Woman In English] Come on. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Come on. [Chattering, Indistinct] [Yells] - [Dutch] Give me the poppers. - No fucking, remember? - I know you've got them. - I don't. Don't lie to me. - Lying isn't allowed? - No. Well, only if necessary... and only for a good cause. Even to your friends? [English] I'm sorry. I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Hey. Hey, Goof. Goof, Goof, Goof. [Dutch] What are you doing? They're not asleep yet. I have to take a leak, okay? - I'll go with you. - No. You keep the girls busy. Goof. - [English] What happened to your hair? - Nothing. It's a new and improved Goof. I'm glad to see you. I want you to take a look at this. What? Goof. Thank you for bringing me this. You're my favorite boy, Goof. You know that. Lara. What happened? For him, I was just easy prey. Don't you ever make mistakes? Hey, Hugo. Where's Goof? What's taking him so long? - Well, I don't know. Shall I take a look? - No. Okay. - I'll meet you down here in 10 minutes. - Where do you go? - I'm gonna say good-bye to Hugo. - Forget about him. Let's go now. [Chuckling] Oh, girls. Wait. I really have to go have a look. Don't start without me. - I didn't know Dutch guys were so boring. - [Laughing] - Goof. - [Cap Rattles] Yeah. - What's keeping you? - Let me shit in peace. Still? You've been in there for an hour. Almost done. Just wiping my butt. You go ahead. Those girls are great. Can't we postpone our stupid plan? [Dutch] Hey, blondie. Friends really shouldn't lie to each other. Come on. Give me the bottle. What happened between you and Lara? Nothing. I don't need that Russian slut. Why would I? Because you keep following your dick. "Love doesn't exist, only lust."Right? Stop preaching. So nothing happened between the two of you? Of course not. You're my friend, right? Think so? Yes. Come on, give me the bottle. - [Imitating Dutch] - [Chuckles] Hey. I don't know if I'd ever forgive you. I know. That's why I'd never do such a thing. And... if I actually had done it... I'd feel really bad about it.
