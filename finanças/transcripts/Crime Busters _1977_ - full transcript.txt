I don't know why you did it but thanks anyway. You're a buddy. I prefer to help somebody who considers me a friend and not just another chop suey. Is there anything I can do for you? Don't worry it's a small world and sooner or later one meets again. Out of the way. Hey chief, I got my stomach glued to my backbone. Got any work for me? Join the union. Give me a break, there's a freighter out there waiting to be unloaded. Get lost. Something wrong? This greaser wants work. Listen sparrow, you flap your wings on outta here unless you wanna wear 'em in a sling. Did you call me a sparrow? Yeah. Hmm, did you say you're gonna break my wings? Yeah. That's what I thought.

You know buddy, we got a lot in common. I'm Matt Kirby. I'm not. That's a nice name. A little short maybe. Why did you bust up their car? It's a question of toilet bowls. Oh that makes a lot of sense. You can't fool around with toilets. And now that I told you the story of my life, go take a walk. I'll be seeing you big banana. Do you have any reason for hanging around here? No. Shove off then. District Police, Sergeant Adams, how may I help you? Oh you sure can. There's a bum just about to commit suicide. The Rochester Street Canal Bridge. Thanks, I'll notify the morgue. But he hasn't done it yet. Oh well then I'll call the psycho boys. Meanwhile try to distract him okay? With what a lollipop? This guy is a regular bulldozer. Okay, I'll send an ambulance. But if he hears it coming he'll jump. Don't worry, we use a two-door sedan in these cases, unmarked and it doesn't come with a siren okay? Yeah that's perfect. Okay. Got some business for the loony bin. There he is, pull over. Hi there. Hi. How's it goin'? Fine. Kind of a nice day isn't it? Very nice, pretty hot though. He's right, hot as hell. If you're hot in that jacket, why don't you try on this one? It's the last word. Hey are you from the loony bin by any chance? No, no. Wait a minute, I'm the guy who called the police. The crazy guy is over there. He's an 18-wheeler. Is he dangerous? Nah, he's like a lamb. He's just got this thing about toilet bowls. Toilet bowls? Yeah. He says you can't trust the ones they make today. He wants to end it all. Mysterious of the human psyche. Yeah. The gas? Right. What's that? Sleeping gas. One whiff and he'll be drowsing off like a bear in hibernation. Ha, great. Stay here. He might be dangerous. Okay. Hi. Nice town huh? It sure is. You call this a town? It's a big toilet bowl. The gentleman said it. It's a toilet bowl. I don't get that comparison. Modern toilet bowls are masterpieces of engineering which this town sure isn't. They may be masterpieces but where's the joy of answering the call of nature at sunrise in the country or by a flowing stream at sunset? Oh well times have changed. I have nothing against the toilet bowls of today. How about you Mr. ? Either are fine. What I can't stand is turds like you. You're rude and antisocial. Hey what's that a can of mountain air? Well not exactly. Would you like to try this on? Grab him! Let's go you big banana! George. Hey Bernie, how long does it take to cook two hamburgers? Man they're ready now if you want them raw. What were you saying? I'm tired of looking for a job. Well it wouldn't take much to change our lives like that. What do you mean? An armored car delivers the payroll to the supermarket every week and they go in the service door not the main entrance and, Hey, hey Bernie. God it's hot today. Nice cold beer boys? Nah nothing alcoholic. We're on duty, a coke. Oh when you're on duty you don't drink huh? No, where are you from? Haha, I was born in Venice, Italy. Then what are you doin' here? You on vacation? No sir, I'm a naturalized U. S. citizen. This makes 16. How about that, 16? They sure don't eat like canaries. What's your top speed? Well if you can stay on, about 130 miles per hour. 130? I don't suppose you could let me try one out. Afraid not. Enlist in the police force, you'll get a chance. We've been thinking on that haven't we? We need guys who are on the ball. Eat up we gotta go. Where? It's late, they're waitin' for us. Who? Forget already. What? Attention all units, 16th district, we have a robbery at the pawn shop at 40516th Street. Units 2112 and 2111 throw road blocks. Oh boy. They took off like a couple of rockets. How many employees are there in a supermarket? 70. And in the office? A pair of old maids. What we actually need is a couple of guns. All we need is a couple of fingers. Huh, oh I got those. Okay friend, I'll see you on Friday morning. Not so fast burner. From now on we're gonna cast one big shadow. Is that so? As my old man always said, if you have a friend you can trust don't trust him but if it's one you can trust blindly, then watch out. Well I mean, if you've got the blind friend, well my old man had the whole thing down pat. Just what we need. Let's keep going and make believe we don't know them. Hey boys. Oh hi. Hi. Well has the great day come yet? Well, maybe. See he isn't quite sure yet. Well you'll never regret it. You'll well off with the police. By the way, did you catch those boys who robbed the pawn shop? Yeah? You bet, 15 minutes after we got the call, they were lyin' on the table down at the morgue and by afternoon their rotten brains were floatin' in formaldehyde in the criminal museum. Serves them right. That'll teach 'em. Right. Yeah, they don't get no pity from us. Well so long. So, so long. So long yeah take care, see ya later. Nice guys. They'll remember this Friday for a long time. You bet. Let's put it off until next Friday. No, you got a dime? Just watch how your partner fixes things partner. What are you gonna do? Keep cool. If they bite we go through with it. The armored car will be here in two minutes. I called the police and told them there's a suspicious looking guy hanging around the jeweler shop on 24th Street. Why? Watch. Hey, you're smarter than I thought. I've crime in my blood. This is it. Keep calm, it'll all go smooth don't worry. As soon as the jobs done, we'll go have some fun in Florida. We're already in Florida. We're really in Florida? Yeah. Hey, it's coming. Your gun, ready, ready? Yeah. This is a holdup, reach for the ceiling. You better say it. Your voice is stronger. Keep cool this is a, A real nice day isn't it? May I use the phone? Get the door. Yes sir. Well boys, did you come to join up?

Morning Captain. Morning. Where'd you catch them? Actually they came by themselves. Uh huh, well if you thinkin' that turning yourselves in is gonna help you, it's not. I'll tell the judge to forget that and throw the book at ya. There's a misunderstanding Captain. These boys are here to enroll in the police force. Here's their application forms and the files we have on them. Uh huh. So you wanna be policemen do ya? First thing you're gonna have to do is shave. Mhmm. Why? Because I don't like whiskers. Now, you're Wilbur Walsh? Oh no, that's him. I've got nothing to do with that. I just met him. Ahh, it says here that, it says here that you wan kicked out of Canada for fightin' destroying property, and resisting arrest. Did you say Canada sir? That's what it says, Canada. Oh yeah, I remember now I was working as a lumberjack. Rough and ready, the only friend you have is your ax. Always isolated in the woods with the wolves. Nothing, well we work. So on Saturday nights you went into town and raised hell. Between the booze and the chicks, you know, a fight starts up and you know where these things go, don't ya? No. I'm a baptist. I don't drink. Yeah I knew it. Now, You're Matthew Kirby. You can call me Matt, Captain. Appreciate it. Now, what is this mean? It says here that you were disqualified for being aggressive disqualified from what? From baseball. I was playing with Red Foxes then. Red Foxes of Ogichobee? Yeah and it was a great team too. I knew that team. Captain, do you wanna know my side of the story? Yeah, there was this real blind umpire who called me out on base. I protested but he wouldn't listen so I punched him in the mouth. Who knows where that bastard is now. It's a good thing he aint around anymore because if only I could get my hands on him I'd, Would you like his address? You know where he is? He lives with me. He's my brother-in-law. No kidding? Gee I'd like to apologize to him. He was right after all. He's got a great eye and nothing got by him. What do you think? Boys will be boys. Who hasn't tied one on one time or another? And besides, everybody calls your brother-in-law names. Hmm. Hey partner, how do I look best? Like this or like this? Thank you. Size? Not for me thanks. Come on, what size do you take? Oh size. XXXX Large. Boots? 14 and a half. 14 and a half? Tell me them gunboats are full of feet. Try these and if they don't go I'll get some pontoons for you. Next. Crime in my blood huh? Can't win them all can you? Anyway, we flunk the final exam and scoot them out on 20 weeks of training pay. Do you think this training's gonna be a picnic? You got another thought comin'. In 20 weeks time, I'm gonna teach you how to make a proper arrest, how to drive a car at 200 miles an hour, how to tell the difference between marijuana and parsley. In short, I'm gonna turn you into super goddamn cops. In exchange for that, the taxpayers are gonna give you 250 dollars a week. They're gonna give you a paid vacation, a Christmas bonus, beautiful uniform, a lot of respect and esteem. In addition to that, at the end of 20 weeks time, you're gonna love me like your own father. Attention! Now move your ass! so, these should be here instead of here. Hands out of the window. Step out of the car, step aways from the car. Face me down on your knees. Lie down on your stomach. Arms out to the sides, palms up. Turn your head to the side. Good job Fred. Now, that was the correct procedure for makin' an arrest. Walsh! Come on, let's go. I taught him that one. Very good Kirby, very good. Let's go. You ever shoot before? Who me? Ready on the firing line. Aim. Ahh, don't shoot at me! Shoot at the target you bastard. Ha, not one bullseye. Okay wiseguy, you do better. Where did you learn to shoot like that? I've got bullets in my blood. Bullets in the blood? Now boys, for good or for bad, Your training is almost over. Naturally we have left the best for the last. Now we're really gonna see if you got the guts to be policeman. Are you ready Doc? Any time you are. Want some gum? What flavor? Formaldehyde. I hate formaldehyde. And now boys, I would like to show you. You forgot to thaw him out. He's as hard as a rock. Last night I moved him myself from the freezer to the humidifier. Think the thermostats broken? I'm sorry Captain. We'll have to postpone it. Sorry boys, the party is off. The Chinaman declined our invitation. Is he Chinese Captain? I would say so. What happened to him? Well we really don't know. We found him by Dock 16 last night full of lead. I knew that guy. Oh yeah, from where? Down at Pier 16 just before I met you. Hmm, was he already horizontal? No, vertical, actually diagonal. He was bent over carrying a big box. He acted like he was afraid of something. He helped me out though. Maybe he was a wharf rat. Did he have any identification sir? No he's just wearin' a dirty shirt and a greasy pair of pants. Should I tell the Captain? Nah, it's better to stay outside of these things. I'm sorry about that. Ahh bullshit, I ask you to do one little thing and you can't do it. Oh you're a pain in the ass. Get the hell out of here, asshole! Is the homicide squad dealing with this Captain? No, no the whole force and if any of you have any ideas you're free to work on them. And don't forget if you need my advice, my door is always open. I like to help the young.

Walsh saw it too. Is that right? Captain, look what we've got here. Jim McCoy and Tom Crane. We've been looking for these guys for months. See that. When I saw who was in the car, I rammed it. I thought better that than a shootout in the middle of the street. Good thinking Kirby, good thinking. You alright Walsh? Take a lesson from your partner. Quick thinking always pays off. Take Car 11, go back to work. Talk about beginner's luck. Beginner's luck? I call it good training. Get this mess cleaned up Sergeant. Things are kind of slow. What would you say to a burger and fries? Right on brother. Headquarters calling 3211, Headquarter calling 3211. Wouldn't you know it. You got 3211 come on back. We have a disturbance reported on the corner or James and 10th. Swing by and check it out. Ten four. Hey knock it off, break it up. What's going on here?

Well seeing as how we're brothers, he oughta split it with me. Ahh he's got a point. It's not right, I found 'em first. That's enough, give him his share. There you go.

You'd better shape up or you're gonna be back walking a beat. Get the hell outta here! Isn't there supposed to be a door on both sides? You don't miss a trick eh chief? I couldn't help noticing. What happened? I had just given this lady a ticket and we're getting back in our car when these two big cars came right at us. I just managed to jump on the hood in time. Who could be wanting to get you? Friends of the Chinaman, or better yet, enemies of the Chinaman, obviously. Obviously, do you happen to know umm, do you think you could? Better keep an eye on Pier 16. Pier 16, exactly my thought, exactly my thought. Very good Kirby. Thanks Captain, can we move on with our investigation? Of course, I'm handling this personally.

Give me a stick of gum. Sure. I chewed it all. Can I help you? Yes you can. I'm looking for 601 Pacific Street please. Did you say Pacific Street? Uh huh. It's on the other side of town. But they told me it was near here. Oh they were all wrong believe me. Is there a bus that goes to Pacific Street? No I'm sorry, but I can take you there. I was just going that way myself and besides it's part of our duty. If a taxpayer has to go to the other side of town, a police officer is obliged to give her a lift. May I? yeah, it's a very interesting job, sometimes very dangerous, but we're ready to make sacrifices to help the taxpayer. That's very honorable what you do. What's life in exchange for helping others? Nothing. You policemen have the chivalry of the ancient samurai. More or less, only we don't go around carrying swords. What did you say? Oh I was just saying you're right. It's lovely here. Yes, you're very beautiful. If you don't mind my asking, what are you doing here in Miami? Now where was I? Oh, I said to myself, if I don't intervene now, I won't stand a chance. So I smashed through the wall with the car and jumped out with my gun drawn and arrested all 36 of them. Alone? Why sure. Who is it? It's me, Suzy Lee. Suzy! Come in. Please come in. Thank you. Did you finish your joyride? Look this is a very interesting case. I'll make it interesting if you don't come back to work. Come on, come on! Please come in, please. Please. Honorable grandfather. These honorable gentlemen are police. Why's he looking at me like that? My honorable grandfather says it's difficult to read your cow-like eyes but he feels that the great dragon is good and that the tiger cub is sharp and quick-witted. Thank you. Tiger cubs sure know their stuff. Please sit down. Thank the old bishop but the big dragon and the alley cat have to get back to the street. Please, please sit down. I guess you don't know but the young lady's uncle, Better say the bread winner of this family. Right. He left a month ago for Shanghai and since then not a word. Nothing. He always sent word the moment he arrived but this time, Nothing. Nothing, well when do you expect your uncle back? Right. In a few days but my honorable grandfather says that the moon is not lasting and that's a bad sign. Well, we'll see what we can do but we need something to go on. I'll give you his picture. That's a good idea. We're in business. That way the moon lasts. This is a picture of my uncle. Yeah, this will help us. We'll see what we can do. See you soon. Yeah. They've screwed us. No they didn't have nothin' with them. Maybe we're still on time, let's go. I must have been born on Friday. Always of yourself huh? Yeah, if you'd given me a job and a doctor I'd tell you I'd never have met you chump. He who finds a friend finds a treasure. Yeah but he who finds you finds himself a cop. Six months go by like nothin'. Why that ugly son of a bitch. You were speeding Ed. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. They're under my jurisdiction. Hey we got ourselves a VIP. Did you say VIP? If we give him a rough time, we'll be bounced off the force in two minutes flat. Officer, I admit we were going a little fast but we're in an awful hurry. You see we were going to, Put your hands out of the window. Don't make any sudden moves. Come out facing me. Come on. Over there. Down on your knees. Down on your stomach. Stretch out your arms. Palms up. Turn your head the other way. Legs up. Now what? I can't remember. Officer! Shut up! Stand up you bums. What's the meaning of this? Make one more move and you'll be pushing up daisies. Let's smell your breath. You smell like a brewery. You're in big trouble pal, real big. It's you who are in trouble, I'll guarantee you that. You shut up. Give me your driver's license. Miami club, rotary club, country club, golf club. You're big on the country clubs eh pimp? Pimp? I'll have you kicked off the force for this, you'll see. Haha, kicked off the force! I'll buy you a drink if you can. What is this? That's the pass to the governor's mansion. Oh yeah, and what do you do there, empty garbage? No, I'm the lieutenant governor. Do you hear that? He's the lieutenant governor. Oh is that so? Terrific huh? Speeding and drunken driving. You'll have some talking to do with the district attorney when I haul your ass in. I hold that office. I'm the district attorney and I'll see that you are ruined for this. Oh he's the district attorney, congratulations. Now I'll keep this. At five o'clock you come to the 16th District with a couple of good lawyers. You don't want to spend the rest of your days behind bars. Alright? Oh it'll give me such pleasure to see you guys thrown out in the street. I hope so, I sure hope so. Oh I promise you that. Now don't move until I drive off. This is a disgrace! Nice going partner. We'll be off the force in next to no time. You say it so. Monsieur Scarface is here sir. Tell him to come in. Hi Boss. Your foot. Got back all of them. Oh good. One more thing, we saw them two cops from the docks coming out of the chinks house just before we went in. That's funny. Why chief? Oh it's not a job for a cop on the beat. This one smells of the narcotics bureau to me. Want us to take care of 'em? And have the entire state police force on our tails? Nah, six months in the hospital will be enough. Okay boss. What do you say Geronimo? 200 dollars to bust up a couple of cops in uniform seems stingy to me. It'll be our first offense you understand? You heard the judge. What if we throw in some good stuff with the 200 bucks? What do we do to 'em huh? Just put 'em in a wheelchair for six months. He's on the war path. Headquarters calling 3211, headquarters calling 3211, 3211 come in please. 3211 is all ears. Hold on boys, McBride wants to speak to you. Hey, yes Chief. McBride here, was it you two who was hassling the lieutenant governor? The laws the same for everybody or am I wrong? That's just what I told them. They called me a few minutes ago and said they were treated like a couple of delinquents. They wanted me to suspend you from the force. That's what they promised us. Let them try. I'll raise so much hell, they'll have to resign. You did exactly the right thing. Is it worth it to go against two big ass politicians? I told them you did exactly the right thing. Now who's in the wrong is gonna, You don't understand. We were in the wrong. McBride out. You and your great ideas. Ice cream. I only have vanilla left. Hey chief, nobody makes vanilla like he does. Well? Give him a taste. You like it? It's easy for you copper. You take advantage of your uniform. Okay, four o'clock parking lot, Orange Bowl.

Remember the Alamo! Come here you! Get up! What's your real name Geronimo? John Phillips Forsythe. An unusual name for an Indian. Okay John Phillip Forsythe, why don't you tell us who sent you? I can't think of anything I'd rather do. Well now. Yeah, sure boss, I think so. He'll be here any minute. Yeah I'll call you when he comes okay? Hey he's crazy. Come on. Hey what the? Hold it. Sit down. Up! Why? Geronimo spilled the beans. Who's Geronimo? You don't know him? No. either they're pretty dumb or they're smarter than we think. Did you hear that noise it made? Those two are trying to pull off something big. That's why they didn't arrest Geronimo or any of you. When's our next load coming in? Friday. Yeah we gotta distract their attention. Keep them busy until Saturday night. I'll find a way. Nah, she'll find a way. What can I do? Phone your sisters, I have a little job for them. Oh that's nice Curly. Oh it's you. Hey what's happened? What's wrong with the old geyser? They've been robbed. Robbed? Last night a little after we left. What did they steal, the mice? The kids' rag dolls. Rag dolls? Yes, all of them. Then they turned the house upside down. They said there should have been another one. My uncle brought them from Shanghai. He would always bring something when he came back from a trip.
