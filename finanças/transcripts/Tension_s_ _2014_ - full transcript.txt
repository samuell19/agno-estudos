- Okay, look. I've got some cash, why don't you just take it and leave? - We don't want your money. - Well take whatever you want and I promise I'll forget the fact that you broke into my house. - You don't get it. - I think you were about to shoot my brother. How are we supposed to trust you now? - I wasn't gonna shoot him. I was just gonna scare him off. Okay, now listen. If you guys leave now, this ends here. I haven't seen your faces. And before you do anything stupid you gotta know that I'm a cop. - Why don't you tell us something we don't already know, Jake? - Francis Kesler, right? A question. A bad motherfucker holds a gun to your partner's head. What do you do? - I'm thinking. - I think you lose. You drop your fucking gun! All right. - Don't hit me so fucking hard, Kesler. - What the fuck was that? - I think you were shot. - No that's BS. My team had you two assholes at gunpoint. We could have shot you at any time. Kesler, admit it, my team won. - Listen, as I said, you got shot, we didn't. - Man, I'm telling you, I'm not buying no beers today. - Fine, it's on me. - By the way, you owe me a new shirt. - Well now that you know we didn't pick the wrong house, you seem a little confused, Jake. - Who are you? We ask the questions here. - Okay, listen. I don't know what you're doing here, but you're not going to achieve anything by bringing guns into my home. - Trust me, we know what we're doing. Don't think we haven't come prepared. - Why are you here? I'm nobody, I'm just a simple cop. - You should give yourself more credit. You are far more useful than you think. What? Are you not alone in the house? Should I go check? - No. No need to check. My daughter's spending the week with her mom. - You mean Kathy? - Why so surprised, Jake? Like I said, we came prepared. - What do you want? Why are you here? - Relax. We're not here to hurt anyone, all right? - Speaking of Kathy, I heard she had some trouble at school. - Listen guys, you obviously want something from me, right? So why don't you leave my daughter out of it? - I heard she was expelled last week for fighting. - You heard wrong, she's doing fine. - It didn't seem that way when her mother dropped her off here last night. - What'd you say to me? - You wouldn't want us to wake her up now, would you? - Don't play games with me. - When I look at you, I see a pathetic, washed up cop who doesn't give a shit about anything. Struck a nerve. Now it seems there's some things you do still care about. Now sit down. - Okay. I'm not sure what you guys want. But why don't we just get to it, okay, come on, what is it? Revenge? You looking for some revenge, is that it? Did I hurt someone you know, maybe a family member or something? Come on, what is it? - I already told you. We're not here to hurt you or your family. All right, but there's something that we need to do and you're gonna help us. We wanna bring justice to the city, Jake and although it doesn't look like it right now, we're the good guys. - Right. Right, that's right, yeah I see that. Good guys who kidnap a cop and his daughter. - Guys smart enough to know what it takes to get people's attention. - Congratulations, you got mine. - Look, we know you spent the last year on desk duty, the downtown precinct on Kent Street. We're not here for that. We want to know about your previous life. - I don't know what you guys are talking about. - We're talking about that. - So what? - So that's you. Or it was you. - Tell us about this previous life of yours. After all, we are in the presence of the famous Jake Lamar. Yeah well don't believe everything you read in the papers. - You don't look much of a hero to me. - I'm not a hero, baby. Just a simple guy doing his job. - Why were you transferred, Jake, hmm? What happened to the pride of Boston? - Just left this all to rest. That's my problem. - Everything became our problem when we put a gun to your head. Now answer the question, why did you transfer out? - Your file doesn't say anything about it. You weren't fired, you requested the transfer. - Do either of you guys have any idea of what it's like to face a hostage taker? It's not like working in a bank. It's not like working in an office. You get it? People's lives are in your hands, you make mistakes, someone dies. - Answer the question. Why did you leave? - 'Cause I fucked up. I failed, I made a mistake, okay? Like I said, unlike working in a fucking bank, in my case, people die. - You've been a hostage negotiator for 10 years. People died before. What was so special about this case? - It was a school, man. Okay, it was a school. We weren't talking about people, we're talking about kids here. - The Dumont Tragedy. - Okay, enough. You're not here to talk about my wife. You're not here to talk about my work, okay? So what is it?! - You're going to do exactly as you're told so that justice can be served. As a cop, it's your job to protect people yet you are completely blind to the threat the city faces. You and the whole police force are a joke. You can't protect shit. - Look, Jake. You can save lives today. And maybe restore some amount of faith in our system. But we honestly can't do it without your help. Now I'm asking you, trust us and you will see the real threat that's been clouding the city. The question is, can we trust you? - What threat? Who's behind it? Why should I trust you? - Just do as you're told. And if you're even half as smart as we think you are you might just figure it out. - It's what we have to do, Jake. Right, nobody's doing a damn thing. Somebody needs to step up. - I am not a police negotiator anymore. I work a desk job in a local police precinct, okay? I've got no more connections. I've got no more power for that matter. So, uh... Maybe you picked the wrong guy, pal, and you made a mistake. - Don't insult us. It's time. - For what? I don't get it. - Enter your password. - What? Do you realize what you're asking me to do here? This is classified information about police personnel. - Yeah, we understand. - Your password, Jake. Don't force me to do something we'll both regret. - Come on man, please, come on, guys. Come on, don't make me do this. - Jake, again I swear to you we have no intentions of harming anyone. But what we're about to expose is far more important than some ridiculous security breach. - I may not be much of a cop anymore but I think I would have an idea if there was a threat against this city. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Did you guys know about the Bensen tower? The Mandel Hotel or the Dumont School? - No. - We're dealing with a group powerful enough to hit us and cover it up so damn fast. The whole police force, even NSA, be completely useless. - You listen to me. There was no way anybody could have known what was gonna happen. No way. No one could have foreseen these guys snapping and doing something so tragic. - Give us some time. You may just change your mind. - I don't give a damn if you believe this or not. Something far greater is going on here today and I will do whatever it takes to stop it. Whatever it takes. You're not alone in this house. I'm gonna be honest with you, hero. We haven't got time for negotiations. You're just one small piece of the puzzle. So I'm going to ask you one last time. Enter the password. - No. I'm done risking people lives. - Okay. - What do you think you're doing here? What do you? - I don't wanna hurt you. - You touch my daughter, you gotta be prepared to kill me. - Enter the fucking password already. Who the fuck is that?! - It's Henry, relax. Who the fuck is Henry? - He's here to pick me up. - What the fuck do we do? - Let me think. - What do we do, Kyle? I'm thinking. - I thought you came prepared for everything. - Get up, get rid of him. Find a way. If he suspects anything, he died because of you. All right, go. - Hi sir, hope I'm not too early. - Well first things first, Henry. Didn't I ask you to call me Jake? - Sir, I went to military school and I was taught way more respect for rank to do that. - I can see that Henry, I can see that. But listen here, kid. My daughter, she brought me home the flu, Henry. She wasn't only contagious but she was very, very generous and I'm not sure whether I want to return the favor to the precinct, you understand? - Okay, should I get you some medication from the store? - No, it's okay Henry, it's fine. I just need a couple days of rest is all. - Sir, don't say that. My girlfriend is one of those believers of not using any drugs. Well, pharmacy drugs of course and she can stay sick for weeks and I was watching some of those doctor shows and some viruses can just kill you. Are you sure, I could be quick. I go and grab it, I'm back in fucking two minutes tops, are you sure? - I'm sure Henry, thank you, I'm sure. And you know what actually, I apologize. I should have let you know. I should have given you a call. - It's no problem, sir. I hope you get everything solved with your wife, well ex- wife. My parents divorce was pretty messy. I mean it's not unusual for ex life partners to get along with each other after. Specially with a child in the middle. And I mean you have a daughter and all, and-- - Stop, stop. Stop, listen to me Henry, please, just do yourself a favor, go to work and stay away from the coffee machine, okay? - Yes sir. Sorry if talk to much when, well anyway, have a good day, sir. - Okay. - Just walk away, kid. Walk away. - What the fuck was he doing here? - Come on guys, just relax. My wife's car broke down. Henry came to pick me up. It's called a divorce. - Watch your mouth, smart-ass. - You did good, Jake. - Didn't think I had a choice. - We've wasted enough time here. Let's get back to work, shall we? - Again, what are we doing here? - Tess said she had some info for us. - By chance, did she pick the spot? - Yup. I'm gonna go check it out. - Yeah, please. - You okay? - I'm fine. How's our guest? - He's fine, just not going anywhere. - Just keep an eye on him. And find that profile. - Give me a second to catch my breath, okay? That was a fucking close call. - We can't expect everything to go as planned. The key is to just keep a handle on things and make sure we do what we came to do. - Yeah? Henry's just a kid. Would you have actually shot him? - Don't do this, David. We have a mission to accomplish. We got to be ready to make some sacrifices. - Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that. We said no one gets hurt. - Listen, little brother. I will do whatever it takes. We need to take a stand here and now. I want this city to be a safe place just like it used to be, before all this corruption and those bastards. I will not let them get away with what they did to my... They're going to pay. - Just tell me we're not gonna hurt anyone that doesn't deserve it, that's all. Fucking say it! - I can't say that. - I'm not ready for this, Kyle and I won't let you. - You don't understand what it's like until it happens to you, so don't even try. - Rico. - So you do remember me. - I know your boss. - Funny, we expected to see you last week and you never showed up. Please give me your gun so there's no confusion. - What do you want? - I'm here as a messenger. Mr. Antonietti would like to see you. - I have nothing to say to him. - I think it'd be unwise to refuse his invitation. - Then I think you should leave. - So what do we do now? - We do nothing. Antonietti had a message for us. We just said we're not interested. That's it, that's the end. Keep searching. - If you told me what you guys are looking for, maybe I could help. - I don't think so. Now, tell me what the pride of Boston is doing training rookies. Kind of hard to believe you walked away from all that fame and attention. - I couldn't care less about the media, man. That's what kills people. - What the hell are you talking about? - The media. Kidnappers and sickos, it's exactly what they're looking for. The chance to be heard. Spread the message to the world and blow themselves up and make sure everybody sees it. Come on counselor, you know how it works, right? You send a letter to a TV station, nothing happens. Point your gun at an unknown victim, then, well, you got your worldwide coverage, right guys? - Is that what you think we are? - We're not terrorists, Jake. Okay, I mean, you have no idea how-- - David! You do as you're told here today, you'll understand everything. You might even be surprised who's involved. - Try me. - Soon. Now, what kind of bullshit do you teach your rookies? - Whatever it takes to get them ready for the field, man. It's a lot different filing reports than dealing with potential killers, right? So I just make sure they're ready. - Are you talking from experience? - I've had to deal with my fair share of shady characters, sure. People who point guns at other people, well, they're always a little unpredictable. I'm sure you guys are well aware of that line. - Don't try and read me, negotiator. Just know that I'm determined to do what's necessary. - I can see that. I've seen that look before. Rage in your eyes. The type of look that tells me you're willing to die to achieve your goal. - Good, I'm glad we understand one another. - There's something else I see. You're looking for blood. But I pray to God that whatever hate's going on inside of you, it's not directed at anyone inside this house. - Tell me about your wife. What happened between you two? - What happened, nothing happened, man. She left me and I don't blame her. - Why'd she leave you? - It's none of your concern. - I'm just trying to understand what happened to you. I mean, look at yourself. You look like shit. Your house is a mess. Now you're working a shitty desk job. See, I could read people too. - What happened doesn't matter. We have a beautiful daughter and we both love her very much, so, we get along just fine. - There's something you're leaving out. - I assume you didn't come here to fix my marriage, right counselor, so why don't you just get back to what it is you want? - Love was never the issue between you two. You never stopped loving her. There's something else. You pushed her away, why? - What do you want from me? What is it you want? Come on, enough of this psycho-babble bullshit about my work and my wife. You've already threatened me. You've threatened my daughter and a kid. Enough. What do you want? - Hey, hey, Kyle. Kyle, I got it. I got it. - Yeah, that's him. You wanna know what we want from you? There it is. - Francis Kesler. We need to know everything about him. - Searching randomly for conspirators on the police database. It's a little extreme, don't you think? - What can you tell us about him? - A member of SWAT. An elite sniper. Oh, yeah. His name's Francis Kesler. Again, what can you tell us about Kesler? - He's an elite member of SWAT. Back when I was a police negotiator, we called Kesler in if there was a sticky situation. Him and his guys would clean everything up. Is that what you wanna know? - Better, but you're not telling us everything. - Bad luck. Maybe you should have kidnapped a SWAT guy. - That's fair. - Okay. You know what, counselor? Being the police negotiator that I was, I think I could give you a tip or two on how to improve your communication skills. We could do this all day, smart mouth. - Whoah, hey, hey, whoah whoah. We already know you guys are tight. It's okay. - Then why are you asking me for? - It's all about cooperation and trust, Jake. We're here to stop a killing and unfortunately we need you. Everything's a test until we stop these murderers. - Kesler and I go back I don't know, maybe 10 years so we were both in the Academy together. - There we go. Now don't forget to mention that he's your daughter's godfather. - Okay, so we're close. - Close enough to lie for him? - What do you mean? - Those are classified papers, Jake. Kesler was the subject of an investigation by IAD. He shot a suspect but fortunately he wasn't on the clock when he did it. - How'd you get these papers? You guys cops? IAD maybe? - Funny you say that. Are you or do you know of any corrupt cops in the city? - That's not what I said. - I honestly don't give a shit. I wanna know why you testified in his favor. - Kesler was accused of shooting a suspect in cold blood. This guy was dangerous. Not only was he dangerous but he was holding innocent people's lives in jeopardy. - See, that's where it gets tricky. You testified under oath that you were at the scene. You were a witness. - That's right. - You were nowhere near the scene when the shooting went down, though. - I think you should check the court documents again. - No, I think you should take a look at this. - 10:45 the same day. You couldn't have been in two places at once. When the suspect Christopher Brown was shot, you were over an hour away from the scene. My wife had the credit card that day. - We also have footage from the gas station security camera. You lied in court to save your friend's career. - Christopher Brown was associated with the local mob. Okay? There were witnesses who saw what this guy did but they're all too scare to testify. I did what I had to do. - You lied! Kesler shot Brown and you covered for him knowing he was guilty! - If Kesler said it was self-defense, I believe him. - Are you sure you know your friend as well as you think? - So that's what this is about, huh? You guys after Kesler? - Look, we got enough evidence to get you and Kesler fired from the force. But what we want is for the both of you to help us expose a conspiracy. - Okay. Give me proof of what you claim and then maybe we can have a deal here. - I swear to you, Jake, within the next hour, you'll know everything and you'll see everyone who's been implicated. - If you guys know who's behind this, why don't you just expose them? - Like we said, these guys are powerful enough to make evidence, even people, just disappear. - We want you to call your friend and ask him for his help. We also need confirmation of the target. - What am I supposed to tell him? - You and Kesler are close and he owes you, okay? Whatever happened in the past, he can change something today. - You understand what it's like to have another person's life in your hands. There's no room for self-pity here. Time to step up. Make the call. - I don't think I can do this. - You don't have a choice. Call Kesler. Tell him your precinct has intel on a threat against the city. You need him for an unofficial operation. We'll feed you the info. - What if I refuse? - That's funny, you see I could blow your head out, splatter your brains all over the walls. Your daughter wouldn't even wake up. - Fuck you. - Is there something you need to tell me? - Did I forget to mention? Kathy's a deaf mute. Make sure she understands what's going on when you wake her up. - You didn't tell me that. - It doesn't change a thing. Now go get her! - Wait! Wait. Okay. All right, I'll do it. - Hello? Hey, man. - Hey Jake, you okay? - Yeah, bud, everything's just fine. - I'm so glad you called. JC's worried about you, she called me last night. - Listen, I didn't call to talk about my wife, Kes. - What's going on? - Listen, Kes, I've got intel that there's gonna be an attack against the city today. They're talking about somebody high profile. - Who's your intel? You know I can't tell you that, pal, but I need your help. - Just tell me what you need. - Okay. I just need you to get ready, Kes. - Give me two minutes. - Something else, buddy. This one's unofficial. - I trust you. - Thanks, pal. I'll get back to you. I don't like using this guy. I hope you guys know what you're doing. Am I supposed to know this guy? - His name's Anton Fisher. Kesler knows him. This man is the key to stopping today's attack. - We want Kesler and his team to get to Fisher. - No. What you want is for me to use my friend Kesler. - Do you even know who Fisher is or the kind of connections he has? - Actually I can't say I do. But what I do know is you're asking me to risk my friend's life for absolutely no reason at all. - Everything we've told you today is the truth. What these guys are planning will bring the country to its knees. Fisher knows the target. He's the only one who can stop it. - We're all risking something here today. - Hey Jake, I'm taking Reese and Yanis with me. What do you have for me? - Okay, sounds good, listen, Kes, what can you tell me about Anton Fisher? - Anton Fisher? Well, he's an asshole who finances a white extremist group. He has been arrested a few times but if you check on his police records, he comes up clean as a baby's ass. - That doesn't make sense, pal. - Actually it does when your brother is Karl Fisher. - The candidate. - The racist asshole whose party preys on people's fear. - Okay, listen, Kes, what can you tell me about Anton Fisher? What else, I need something. - Okay, what I'm about to tell you is classified. He was being watched very closely. But when his brother Karl Fisher became one of the frontrunner candidates, the investigation stopped. Jake, why don't you tell me what's going on really? - Okay listen, Kes, we have reason to believe that Anton Fisher's behind this attack on the city, okay? I'm hearing an assassination attempt, somebody high profile. - Tell me you're fucking with me. - No I'm not, what's going on? - He snuck in boys in the city. He's calling for a private meeting regarding last week's events. - No shit, Kes. No one knows about it. - Listen to me, buddy. I need you to find me Anton Fisher. I need you to find me Anton Fisher right now. When you do, you call me ASAP, you got it? - Right, let me make some calls, I'll find him. - Okay, Kes, watch your back. - Sure. - Thanks, pal. - So you starting to believe us now? - I don't know. This Anton Fisher's a low level crook. He doesn't have the connections, he doesn't have the power to really pull anything like this off. - No, no no, you don't understand. Karl Fisher is using his little brother to-- - Karl Fisher is getting very, very close with Senator Kimball right now. - Jake, we have been working for months on stopping this. Fisher has been planning each of his moves for years, okay? Today's attack is just part of a long scheme that he and his supporters have been waiting for. - We understand you don't believe us. That's why we want Anton Fisher to tell you himself. Okay, you guys take that way, I go this way. - Clear. - Guys, we have a security breach. - Shh. Put the fucking gun down. Nice and slow, that's it, very slow. - Put your hands up. Turn around slowly. - Kes, we got Fisher. - Copy that. I'm on my way. What the fuck? - He tried to shoot at us, man. - I want to see a fucking warrant right now! - I don't think you understand. - You're not under arrest. - Like he said, you're not under arrest. Fuck you! - What the fuck are you doing? You guys have any idea what kind of trouble you're getting yourself into? - Anton Fisher, I assume you know why we're here. We have been watching you for weeks. We know everything. - Bullshit. - We know about today's attack. - I wanna see my lawyer. I got nothing to say to you guys. - Yeah well, we'll see about that. - We know about the money laundering, the fraud, your ties to a white extremist group. - Check your facts. I got a clean record. - I wonder why. - Then you should know. Whatever you have on me, it's not gonna stick. In fact I'll be out of here in a few hours. - Again, we're not here to arrest you. - You're making a big mistake being here, man. I'm gonna have both your heads for this. - Whatever you say. Now what we want to know is about today's attack. - I'm a businessman. You got the wrong guy. - You're a fucking crook. And you should have been thrown in jail a long time ago if it wasn't for your brother. - Well I have to admit, my brother's political aspirations have certainly made my business profitable. - That gives you freedom to do shitty deals without police snooping around. Not bad. - You got nothing on me. - You understand we are talking about national security, right? So why don't you tell us what we need to know or this nice little chat we're having is gonna turn ugly. - You can't touch me. - Well this is where you're wrong, Anton. See, this is your last chance. What's going down today? That's how you wanna play it? All right, all right. - Kes? - It's done, we have Anton Fisher. - Okay that's good, did he tell you anything at all? - Not yet. But I can tell that motherfucker is hiding something. - Yeah, I think so too. Listen, we need confirmation on the attack, okay? You get this guy to talk. - Okay, just tell me how far you want me to go. - As far as you need to, Kes. - We are talking about Karl Fisher's brother. Are you sure? - Yeah. - Listen, we know that you're involved in an attack. We know that this attack is gonna happen today. Most importantly, we know that Senator Kimball is in Boston today. - I got nothing to say to you. - Who's your fucking target? - Go fuck yourself! - Get his fucking hand. - You starting to see it? - I didn't say that. - You better get ready. Don't say a word. Fuck, it's that kid Henry again. - Now listen to me, just relax. I told you he's a rookie. I'll take care of it. Please, just relax. - Just do it fast. Go, now. - Okay. Henry, what do you want? - Sir, I know you said you don't want anything, but if you got a virus, you're gonna need to kill it. So I got you some medication from the pharmacy down the street. - Okay Henry, thank you. Thank you very much. - Boss, no problem, yeah. - Great, great, listen. Aren't you gonna be late for work? - Yes sir. I understand, sir. - Henry, Henry, go. Henry? Ha, no, man! No! Come on. - I'm gonna fucking shoot you. - He's just a fucking kid. - Now, now! We had a deal. You broke it. He almost died because of you, Jake. - Where'd you take him? - Don't worry, he'll be fine. Understand, we don't have a lot of time. Everything we're doing today depends on you. If we fail, people die. Failure is not an option here. - That wasn't meant to happen, man. - We use our group to launder money and to deal a few things. It's nothing major. - We don't give a shit about that. We just wanna know about today. - I told you man, I don't know! - I think you do. Who's behind it? All right, listen. I'm sorry, I shouldn't push you like that. Okay, now I need you to give me something or I fucking kill you! - What do you and your degenerates have planned for today?! Damn it! - If you do anything like that again, I will shoot Henry right before your daughter. Are we clear? Say it. - Yeah, we're clear. - Sit down! - Don't you touch me! The fuck, yo, stop it! Stop it or I'll fucking shoot you. - Get the file! All right, hero. Let's get back into this. I assume you know this man. - Malik Sayidi. - What do you know about him, Jake? - Claimed to be part of some terrorist group. Took a classroom full of 10 year old kids hostage. We tried everything we could to save the kids but I guess you guys saw the rest of it on TV. - And did you find any evidence that he was part of this terrorist group? Actually no, we didn't. - What did you find? - He was born in Pakistan. He traveled back and forth quite a bit. We assume that's where he made most of his connections. Back in Boston, we didn't really find much of anything, just a little C4 left back in his apartment. - Look at me. Fucking look at me! Tell me what I need to know and it stops. Give me the gun. His hand. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! - The evidence you found was planted there. - It's true, Jake. Malik's ID was clean. You and your man shot an innocent man and you triggered that bomb. - A guy who kills kids can't be called innocent in my books. - What if I told you he didn't kill those children? - You're saying, what are you saying?! - Are you that blind, you can't see the evidence right in front of your fucking face? - I don't buy it. I don't buy it. - Jake, why don't you call Anton Fisher? Ask him about Malik, see what he says. - What would Fisher know about Sayidi? - Do it. Call Kesler. Tell Fisher to tell you about Sayidi. Do it. - Okay. Okay, I'll do it. Kes. - Yeah Jake. We got him, listen to this. - Tell him what you just told us. - I'm part of a group called Snow. The group was created to finance my brother's campaign and manipulate the public. What have you done? - Bribery, blackmail, threats, payoffs. Whatever was needed to make sure the campaign was a success. - Did you get that, Jake? Karl Fisher's in on it. - Tell me about Malik Sayidi. - No, no, I'm done talking here. I'm a fucking dead man. - It's okay, tell him. - Malik Sayidi was paid by Snow. - What'd he do for you? - He was hurting for cash so I recruited him to move money bags. We ended up stealing all the money that was involved and Sayidi was left with a debt that he couldn't repay. - You set him up. - I made him an offer he couldn't refuse. - You sent him to the Dumont School. - All fucked up, man, that was not my idea. - You had Sayidi claiming to be a terrorist and he took all those kids hostage, why? What for? - It's all part of the bigger plan. Listen man, the people needed a push to think that they need my brother and his ideas. Really, the whole fucking country's falling into the hands of blacks, latinos, religious freaks. We gave them a fucking push, man. The people needed a push so they can see that. That's it, that's all. Fuck off. Don't give me that fucking look. I'm not the fucking monster here. I'm a fucking patriot! The country's at war and nobody wants to do a fucking thing about it. So I do something and you give me that fucking look? Right. - Jake, I guess you got that. - Kes, Kes, listen to me. You remember those attacks the last couple years? We couldn't find anything on Sayidi. All the investigations that didn't lead to anything, do you remember that? What do you think, maybe? - Okay, hold on. - You and your group were behind those other attacks on the city, right? - No fucking way. Go fuck yourself, man, I'm done talking. You're just getting started, motherfucker. - Kes, listen to me, we're running out of time. Call me back when this piece of shit tells you something. Oh my god. Who are you, how do you know? - I'll tell you this. When life no longer has any meaning, revenge becomes its own reward. - Yeah well, I've done everything you guys have asked me to do, right? I believe you're not lying anymore. And I'm promising you justice will be served. That's what I do, I'm a cop. But you gotta promise me that Henry and my daughter leave this house right now. - Let's face it, Jake, we're not done here. I'm glad you finally opened your eyes but, no one's leaving this house until it's finished. - Anton Fisher's gonna tell us exactly who's behind this any minute. Then it ends. - Ah, not exactly. We don't want Anton Fisher buying his way out of jail. Let's face it. Karl Fisher is a very powerful, very influential politician. Even if his brother does testify, then what? - This conspiracy's gonna blow up. Everybody's gonna see it. Everybody. - You just don't get it, do you? Anton Fisher has already confessed. He and his group have done all the dirty work for Karl Fisher. Even killing innocent children. No, he is not living one more day. - Yeah, he is your key witness to the whole conspiracy. - See that's your problem, Jake. You believe in a justice system that has let this man get away with this for years! Now, I'm making my own justice. - Okay. Hey David. You can't be agreeing with this man. - Sorry Jake, but, Anton Fisher deserves to die. - Right, yeah I get it. Little brother does everything his big brother tells him, I get how it works, yeah. - Last call, Jake. We want Kesler to execute Fisher. - Please stop! - Anytime, just tell me. Just tell me what I need to know. And I stop right here, right now, I swear. - We stopped the bleeding. Gonna get you something for the pain. - Okay, another one. - Untie Mr. Fisher and give me the fucking phone. - Okay, sure. - What? - Go fuck yourself. No, fuck, what the fuck?! - How did that feel, huh cap? Next one's for Henry. And I've got plenty left for your daughter. - This is wrong. Looks like he missed the bone. - Gee, thanks. I'm doing the best I can. - You call this doing what you can? - I said I'm fucking helping if I can. - What are you, a nurse? Get your ass upstairs and check on the girl. - You said no one gets hurt! - I said check on the girl. Go! - David. Please, don't touch her. - It's okay. I'm just checking to make sure she's still sleeping, that's all. - About that phone call. Now that you know I'm serious. - I'm gonna kill you. - I'm right here. - Jake. We have a problem. - What? - She's fine, she's sleeping. What? - We did it, little brother. Anton Fisher's dead. - So it's over. - What's over? Nothing's over, we still got a target out there. My precinct can back us up. - No, Jake, you were right. It was never about justice. It was about revenge. I wanted Anton Fisher dead. It's not like he didn't deserve it. - What happened with you and Fisher? - I have my reasons. And he's not the only one responsible for these killings. - He did something really bad to you, didn't he? - Fisher destroyed a lot of lives. Mine was just one. - So now you blame me for this attack, why? - You were one of the people who should have seen this coming. You were supposed to protect our children. You could have stopped Fisher! - I didn't know. - Because your daughter wasn't a victim, Jake. You are as guilty as the rest of them. You killed an innocent man. - No, man, no. I was trying to stop a terrorist from murdering innocent children. I had seconds to make a decision. - And you made the wrong one. By killing Sayidi, you took out the one witness who could have exposed all the truth behind these attacks! - People die, right? Maybe that's something you can't understand but I gotta fucking live with it. - Don't feel sorry for yourself. You lost everyone because you pushed everyone away! At least your family is still alive. For now. - You're not looking so good. - I'm not feeling to good. - Let him suffer! - He's not gonna suffer, Kyle. He's gonna pass out. - I've got some meds upstairs. Please. - Come on. - Why does your brother wanna kill me? - You'll understand soon enough. How you feeling? - I'm okay. - Come on, we gotta go. - I gotta use the bathroom. Just give me a couple minutes please. - You got 20 seconds. And I'm right behind that door. Come on Jake, what are you doing in there? - Nothing, just give me, give me a second. Come on, we gotta go now. Let's go. - Okay. Come on. Well, you look like shit. - Getting shot does that to you sometimes. Good to see you still have your sense of humor because I have one final task for you. Karl Fisher is a dangerous and powerful man. He must be stopped. - I could have a team follow him day and night, tap his phone. - Sure, we can do that. Or we could kill him. - No, you got no chance, man. The security team he's got, he'll shoot you before you take one step into that building. Who said anything about me? - Are you out of your mind? - What happens when Karl Fisher sends a fake terrorist to blow up your daughter's school? Do you ever think about that? - You want Karl Fisher dead? Why don't you fucking kill him yourself? - Yes, I would love to. But as you so eloquently stated, I would never be able to get close to him. You on the other hand, have met our dear Senator Kimball on several occasions. They know you, they trust you. You're the only one who could do it. I would love to debate this all day with you, unfortunately we're out of time. - It's my fault. - It's not that. Something's off. Jake said something about Fisher. - So what? - I don't know, I think he was trying to tell me something. Some kind of old code we used. Kathy. - Jake didn't call us from the precinct, did he? - We should tell Henry. - Down, down! Okay negotiator. I'm gonna make this real simple for you. Here's the drill. Karl Fisher and Henry the rookie. Two hostages. In order for one to live, one dies. It's your decision. You have 10 seconds, choose. - Kyle, don't do it. Kyle, look at me, please look at me, don't do it. You'll regret it for the rest of your life. - Five seconds. - Oh Henry, I'm sorry. Please, please Kyle, you can't do this. Look at me, don't do it! - Time's up. - Oh no! You shot a cop! - I told you that nothing would stop me. You've got 40 minutes to get to that meeting and kill Fisher! - Okay. - Guys, we got company. There's three guys and a shitload of guns. - We will be able to track your movements through the security camera. But if anything goes wrong, I don't need to tell you what happens then. - You touch my daughter, I'm gonna kill you. - I'm right here. Now David, take him upstairs, get him cleaned up, get him ready. Then bring the girl down. Let's go. - On your way. Do you know what that is? Yeah. - Don't move. - Yeah I've done this once or twice. - God that one. Big galoot. You're not dying on me just yet, son. - Come on Jake, what are you doing in there? Give me a few seconds, please. I think I'm gonna be sick. - No offense man, we gotta get going. Come on! - That's it? How does it feel? I don't wanna kill you, David. But this stops right now. Get up, get up! Get up! Move. David, is that camera up yet? - It's working just fine. Drop the gun, Kyle. - No. Not until you kill Kyle Fisher. - David, you move and I'll put a bullet right in the back of your fucking skull, David. Kyle? - You'll have to kill me first. - Ah, fuck, fuck, wait! His son was a fucking student at Dumont school, man. His name was Jeremy. - Back off! Back off, Jake. Oh, David! Back off. David! I'll kill her, I will, I'll do it. - No you won't Kyle. Kathy, he's not gonna shoot you. - I'll do it, I swear to god I will. - It's gonna be okay. Kyle, you listen to me. I know you won't shoot her because I know what it's like to lose a child. I know about Jeremy. - No. You don't say his name. You don't ever say his name. You were supposed to protect him! - Hurting Kathy wasn't part of your plan. Please, look at my baby girl. She's got nothing to do with anything. She's my baby girl, please don't. - Kyle, he's right, man. This is wrong. She's a damn kid who shouldn't fucking be here! David! - Aaah! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, baby. Keep moving, okay. Stay awake. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - I think someone's here to see you. - This one, Jake. I hope you understand it's your last chance to get your family back. Go get them. - Mr. Fisher, what can you tell us about the recent events? - Ah well, what happened was a tragedy. And I want the people to know that these attacks will not go unpunished. - What can you tell us about your brother, Anton Fisher? - My brother was a good man and a patriot. He was trying to protect our way of life when he was murdered. - There have been rumors of a conspiracy. - All I can tell you is that our country has enemies. And when the time comes, we will all have to take sides. We live in a beautiful country and we need to protect it. Thank you, that will be all for today. - One last word please, concerning Senator Kimball. - Ah, Senator Kimball was not only a great man. He was a good friend. His assassination is a declaration of war on our country. And we will not be intimidated and we will not give in to fear. Now we've been informed that terrorist cells have emerged in several cities including Boston. - There have been allegations of mass arrests based on people of ethnic background and religion. - Well someone had to take measures against these threats. I'm not afraid to be that person. - One last question, Mr. Fisher. Are you declaring war against terrorism or certain minorities? - We're done here. ?
