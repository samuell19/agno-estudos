SOUND AND FURY "Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, ere human statute purged the gentle weal." HOME: 7 YURI GAGARIN ST. LA NOUE APARTMENTS It's OK, Superman, we're home. Mrs Scamperle? Hi, Bruno. Your mother gave me something for you. 15th floor, number 152. - Cute canary. What's its name? - Superman. The elevators aren't working. Somebody set the doormat on fire! Get some water! - The doormat's on fire! - Yours too? An arsonist! Fire! Lemme go, you bastard! Hot-shit janitor! My pop'll murder you! Nobody pushes me around. Let go of him. You his dad? Know what your lousy kid did? He slugged me. No one hits my son. Except me. Bug me or my family and you'll be sorry you were born. Now beat it! WELCOME, DARLING Bruno? Hi, Mom. I see you found your way alone. I couldn't come. Lots of people at the funeral? Not many. You'll be happy with me. We'll be together, even if I'm not there much. Are you sad? No. Where'll I sleep? At the end of the hall. I left money under the TV. Buy some food. I won't be home tonight. I'm working to get us out of that dump. Bye, darling, I love you. And ride along the Seine Into the park at Vincennes Toward my happy suburban home Where my mother's waiting With tears in her eyes And joy in her heart God, how nice everyone is God, life's full of smiles Thank you, God God, thanks for being here It must be a dream I see the Isle of Love... Didn't bring your school bag? I forgot it. You're behind a bit in school... ...so we're putting you in 7th grade. An experimental class. In a month or two, if you catch up, we'll switch you. You'll have only one teacher, except for English. She's a very nice lady. Shut up, it's the principal! Here's a new classmate, Bruno Scamperle. I'm relying on you to show him the ropes. He forgot his pencils and notebook. I hope someone will lend him what he needs. By the way... ...quiet down a bit. You bother the other kids. Bruno, go sit beside Nelly. Nelly, tell him what to do and what stuff he needs. Sit down. Got a pen? Here. Samira, Kalila, Karim, give out the math problems. - Need the jacket? - I'm cold. - It's so sunny. - I want it on. - Samy, where's your gear? - I don't have it, ma'am. You lend him some. OK, a notebook... No, I'll write it down. There're problems. - Drop dead! - I'll get you, bitch! Quit bugging me! - What's going on? - He swiped my pen. - I borrowed it. - Sit down. - Now my stuff's gone. - I'm no dummy. - Where's yours? - I don't have 'em. - He keeps things. - Borrow what you need. Do your math problems. Can I sit here a second, Nelly? - What do you see? - Nothing, ma'am. Know what this says? Understand it? Re-read the first sentence. "Luke, Patrick, Oliver and Philip... decide to... effectuate a... series of... laps... around... the... school yard." Well? What's "effectuate" mean? "To do." It's four guys running in the yard. OK, keep going. Ma'am, I need some help. Swipe her dough or you won't get a blow-job. I'll bust your head! Cut the crap. What're you doing? He wouldn't lend me his pen. So now you have one. Back to your seat. It didn't work. Next time it will. Come on. Whaddya want? Hey, guys, get in front of me... So teacher can't see us. Go on, take it. - Not here. - Tonight, in the basement? DARLING, DO THE DISHES AND IRONING. ALL MY LOVE. GO TO SCHOOL. DEAREST, DO YOUR HOMEWORK. KISSES, MOM. So long, Superman. Hey, Scamper! What're you doing? You're not blind. Is it yours? - Get on the back. - Where to? The cellar, to wait for Maria, have some laughs. Come on. Scared? The girl from class! Bitch! Look what I found on him, Mina. Do we cut him? You're on our turf. You gotta pay for that. I did what you wanted. Satisfied? Read your composition to us? "I spent the best years of my youth at the CAB." "That means Children's Aid Bureau." "It's for kids with family problems... like me." "CAB kids are supposed to be thugs, thieves and outlaws." "I think they're just unhappy kids... because of their parents... like me." "A boy once arrived at the CAB... with a canary he'd found." "Everyone said the canary was a jinx. But the boy kept it." "One night he gave me his bird." "With everyone asleep, he stole a knife and killed himself with it in the john." "To save the bird's life, I protected it and put it in another cage. " "Sometimes I let him fly around the house. " "I feed him. He sings for me and loves me. I love him, too. " "Sometimes he takes other forms and does miracles for me. " "Nobody believes that, so I shut up about it. " Like the bike? - I can change it. - This one's fine. - That your dog? - No, but it follows me. Let's see. Here, Fido. That's great. Wait. What're you doing? We'll have some fun. Jerk! You nuts? What's got into you? I don't like you to hurt animals! I'm not hurting you. I just don't like it. You're weird. Let's have a laugh. Over there... Those two aren't animals. Hey, your ass is on fire! Little creeps! Will your folks mind? Gotcha! Never forget. Always stay on your toes. Dad's strict, but he teaches you what life's about. Wanna see a movie? - Hi, Unc. - Marcel here? Hi, little brother. You don't look happy. What're you sulking about? Come and practice. Jean-Roger, kiss your uncle! Come on! Hi, Unc. Great jacket. You're just in time. Come and practice. Pop, can I... Get lost. What's eating you today? Someone swiped my car. Your old Volvo? I'll get you a new one. It wasn't the old Volvo. I palmed that off on some sucker. I bought a brand-new BMW. If I catch the bastard who stole it... What licence number? 252O WWA 93. What's got into you? You gone nuts? OK? You swiped it? Why didn't you tell me you bought new wheels? Let's play pinball. Move your ass! Aim for the feathers. You missed! You OK, Grandpa? Want anything? You in pain? Only Mom can understand him. What's he got? It's his throat. He can drink a little, that's all. Looks like he's melting away. Why isn't he in a hospital? Dad wants him with us. Shit! Talk about a screwball family! Frankly, I've had it! I'll tell the janitor! Bastards! I'm moving out of here! Sandrine, bring your ma! So pull a gun, go ahead... Oh, no! My new hair-dryer! Work all day and come home to this mess! It's too much! Sure, go on and laugh, Very clever! Idiots! Here. Your daughter's a knock-out. Watch out, she's taboo. Come here. I've big got plans for her. You're not gonna soil her! And you can plug this hole yourself! Damn bitch! I'm sick of her. Let's go to your place. Take the Winchester. Alright. Thierry! If you're a man like your dad, come shoot with us. I'm sick of your crap. How about this brat! He's changed. Give us a blast. Here. He's got a job, stopped drinking and smoking. Know why? For a broad. Who also works. My son! Admit it, he's your favourite. Hey, asshole, I hope you at least fuck the chick after work! Here. Now come on with us. Look at yourself! Look at all of you! If I stay here I'll kill myself! Out of my way, lush! I'll kill myself! That what you want? I'll kill myself! I'll whip him! You down there, assholes, you're all gonna die! Dumb bastards... I'm gonna jump, assholes! Ah, shit! Take the guns. We're going. You, go home. DARLING: DON'T EXPECT ME TONIGHT. GO TO SCHOOL, LOVE, MOM REMEMBER HOMEWORK, DINNER, BED. KISSES, MOM Hungry, Superman? - Get ready. - With what? Maigret and the Tramp. - I don't have it. - Read it with your neighbour. Pages 81, 82, 83... Read them to yourselves, then I'll ask questions. - This isn't your seat. - He doesn't have his book. After the lesson, go back to your seat. Jean-Roger, wake up! You're not here to sleep. It's my job to make you work. If you don't, I'll punish you. No lousy teacher orders me around! You've got no right to slap me, bitch! Take it easy. Sit down. - Bruno, what're you doing? - I'm a copycat. You mean if Jean-Roger jumps out a window, you will too? Great idea. I'll jump out and you all follow. Revolution! Is everyone out? Just about. Bruno, out you go. - And the case worker? - On her way. She's a bit late. You stay right here. If I want. Sir, I've had enough of Jean-Roger Roffi. Call a board meeting. I want him expelled. Not before he's 16. I have to put up with him? I didn't make the law. Can't we exchange him? With the other district school? They'd never accept anyone in the Roffi family. Suspend him for a week? We'd have to make a written request. I don't want the Superintendent in all this. One day, two at the most... That's the best thing. I did you a favour taking this class. If I'd known... Principal, Assistant, Miss... Sorry I'm late. - What are you proposing? - A two-day suspension to start with. He'll just hang out with the local gangs. That's a police problem, not mine. What can the police do? So I have to keep him but not punish him? Alright. I'll see what I can do with the family. Anybody home? May I come in? KILL THE CASE WORKER What kinda shit you handing us, bitch? If you come back here or try to bug us... ...you'll be sorry you were born. Got that? Now beat it! See her face? What's funny? Quit laughing. You too. Little jerks! Tomorrow I'll ask questions on the text. - What's up? - It's time. 3:55 - You wait. - The bell rang. - It rings at 4pm. - Is that so? OK, you, a week's suspension starting tomorrow, but confined to my office doing homework. The case worker? She quit. We've no replacement. You come with me. At this time of day? I'm splitting. Take it easy, or I'll make you sorry you were born. I come here when I want... ...and I split when I want. Stay a minute, Bruno? Find your old notebooks? Show them to me? Good! You worked well and got good grades. What's wrong? You said I worked well. So? I thought I was hopeless. You did? You mean it? I'm not hopeless? How could you think that? Come and look. Know what I'd like you to do? See me after class when the others are gone... If you haven't understood something, if you want to... "I learned late to like birds. I regret that." "But it's alright now. We understand each other." "They pay no attention to me, nor I to them." "I watch them, I don't bother them." "All birds do their best..." There's a whole part I don't get. Can I go on? "The birds set an example, the right example, the birds' example..." "Example: Birds' feathers, wings, flight." "Example: Birds' nest, travels and song." "Example: The beauty of birds. Example: The heart of birds." "The light of birds." Jacques Prevert. Alright. Take your things. It's over. May I have a flower? Of course. You'll spoil it that way. You coming, ma'am? Neat movie! Did Thierry really move out? Where does he work? I don't know. I do. Can we come too? Let's go. Come on. I'll show you another one with real murders. Thierry! Robinot! Dumb prick! Making a fool of himself! What're you laughing at? What brings you here? - What're you doing here? - That's obvious. Why's she here? She works for the paper. Thanks to her, I landed a job in the printing plant. Know how much I earn? Twice as much as a factory hand. And I'll get more. She and I will live there soon. You stay here. Why doesn't he talk to me? Or put his arm around me, like a buddy? It doesn't matter, forget it. I don't understand you. I give you plenty of dough. Think you'll be happier? You won't! You don't belong with those people. Once the great lay is over, then what? Spend your life being bored in a gilded prison... If you're lucky. I want a quiet life, a good job, decent people's respect. Like a slave. All your life. I saw bodies cut in two, piled up in the mud. Blinded kids, tortured old crones... Truckloads of stiffs. In the army? You never talk about it. To anybody. There's no God, no hell, nothing, kid. Just a big black hole at the end. It's all a war that never ends. I won't stick my neck out any more. I don't want you too, either. Nobody counts but yourself. Laws are made for jerks. Do like I do. Don't aim too high. You'll be rich and free. By suckering slobs like us? Use kids, like Mina and the rest of us. There's no risk for you or them. Scared of prison? You won't be inside long. It'd be no worse than getting up every morning to work in a factory. But when you get out... you'll have light, sunshine... while the other assholes slave their lives away! Go away... Try the country for a week or two. Without the girl. Think things over. If he doesn't live with his chick... ...if he stays with us... I'll kill him. You go to school with those jerks? Let's have some laughs. Look. They want Mina's gang. We gotta warn 'em. Go on, open it. - What is it? - You'll see. Stop! - Everything OK? - Beat it, you. If we hear you squealed on us, we'll kill you. Now scram! See ya, Scamper. Don't be sore. Now you gotta prove you're a man. "I came calmly, an orphan, Rich only in my quiet eyes, To the men in the great city: They did not find me wise." "At 2O, a new dismay assailed me, Love, by name." "Women were beautiful to me: I was not handsome to them." "Though without country or king, And not very brave "I wanted to die in the war: Death did not want me." "Death did not want me." "Was I born too soon or too late? Why am I in this world?" "O all of you, my pain is deep-rooted: Pray for poor Gaspard." Paul Verlaine. Want to help me? What keeps the Chinese from falling off? What? Bring me the globe, with the little toy. What do you want to know? How do the... Chinese keep from falling off? China's not in the southern hemisphere. It's here. See? But why don't they fall off? When you leave Earth, you don't fall, you float. On Earth, a kind of magnet draws you to the centre. Sure, but... ...how come the Chinese don't fall off? Great! That's terrific, ma'am. Take off your headphones. - What'd you say? - Got a brush? - No, ma'am. - Borrow one. Beat it. Coming with me later? I don't feel like it. Don't be dumb. You're sore because the gang banned you. Come in. Over here. It's the teacher... You in love with her? Come and look. People on the other side of Earth are held like this. They walk like we do. But they see the sky upside down. For this little man, where's "down"? Right. And where's the sky? Here. So we're all held by this ball... here. After that, clouds... and empty space. Then the stars very far away. That makes us tiny! Go back to your seat. What's that? It's neat! He circles the globe. What's it for? - Why doesn't? - Let someone answer. - Traction... - Is it real? What's gravity, ma'am? The attraction the Earth exerts. Coming with me? - Why'd you bring it? - To show it to you. He's upside down. What're you up to? Aren't we buddies? I never had any buddies. Get lost. Got any envelopes? Give me one... with the printing gismo. It's spotted. Can't you keep anything clean? I'll dictate. Don't make any spelling mistakes. "Dear Principal..." You can recopy it later. Keep going. "The teacher in class 7D... does dirty things with a student... after class." - How's "Valley of the Kings"? - OK. - Looks nice. - It is. Sign it, "A friend who's on your side." Shoot and aim without breathing. Go on. - What'd you aim at? - A bottle. Who taught you how? My dad. Says I'm a natural. He's exaggerating... a little. Put the bottles back up. Know what I'm gonna do? Take a sniper's rifle up on the roof... ...and shoot at passers-by. When the cops come, I'll pick 'em off one by one. You're going nuts. You're right. How would I get off the roof? You're a real buddy. Wait here. I know you! - You're Thierry's brother. Where is he? - The country. I must see him. Give me his address. Why? We're going to live together, so I need his address. Monk Island, at Carneau... in Brittany. That bitch drives me nuts! Is he gonna die? Don't worry, he's always like this. - We going? - Wait. I'll play a little pinball. That's it. Been nice working with you. Likewise. If you've got any more jobs for me... Sandrine, get us a drink! Fetch your uncle... He can drink with us. What'll you have? A beer. - Cute kid. - Don't touch. Let her go. Let her go! - The old man... - Help me. Bash his head in with a bottle. He's dead. What's going on? Shit! Dump these guys in your car. - They're not dead? - No, it's nothing. Help him, Jean-Roger. And Grandpa? The old gent got this out. He turned a little, as if he was hesitating... Then he told me, "I'm in you, you're in me. Tell them we're all brothers." "Pray for me and them." Then he died. Beat it. On the palace steps On the palace steps Was a very beautiful girl, tra-la Was a very beautiful girl She had so many lovers She had so many lovers That she didn't know which to take, tra-la... She didn't know which to take A little shoemaker A little shoemaker Was the one she chose, tra-la Was the one she chose Beauty, if you wanted Beauty, if you wanted We could sleep together, tra-la We could sleep together In a big square bed In a big square bed Covered with white linen, tra-la Covered with white linen I'll never learn your waltz, ma'am. Teach me something else? What? Rock, and all that? Leave us for a moment, OK? A kid playing a joke. It's from Jean-Roger Roffi. A very dangerous letter. KEEP IT UP AND YOU'LL DIE, BITCH! Still here? Run along, kid. Move, I said! Can I come in the evening? Not for a while. I forgot my things. Can I go get them? Let me go up with you. I must see him alone. We're gonna have a ball. We've got a chick for you. Come on. Which one do you want? Don't you like them? You have to show us you're a man. At the end of the street... my brother's girl. She's pretty? In the street. OK. Let these two go. You're all I ever had, Superman. Superman! Come back! You chose to be a slave... ...all your life. Remember, all there is at the end is that big black hole. You're right, she's beautiful. You want her? Take her. Lie down! See? She turns you on. Go to it, Jean-Roger. She's a hot one. Superman! Come back! Jean-Roger! Go bust his head! Stop! See what he did? He needs a good lesson... ...so when he comes to he won't do it again. We'll light a bonfire. Bring him along. Forget it. We'll work him over. You three, come here. Go on. Anybody touches my son gets massacred! Scatter! You OK? Beat it. I'll join you. Come here, you! Get down! Stay right there! Put that down! Shit, he'll kill me! Now what do we do? Why don't you do a miracle? You do, sometimes. Hide the stiffs, then we'll split. You come too. I'll join you later. Go on, split. So? What do we do? He's flipped. Let's go. Hey, bird... Why no miracle? Behind the big doors of light... ...l'll be with Superman again. And Grandma. Can I kiss her? What's new, Samira? I'm in a bookkeeping course. I like it. - You're OK, then? - Great. You're teaching French now? I was trained for that. The janitor asked me to give you this. I hope you're alright, not having too hard a time with trouble-makers like me. Everyone's nice here. I go to school, and I've got doctors I just talk to. Sometimes I'm bored, kind of sad. But I want to use this ballpoint to talk about something else. I think about it all the time but I can't tell anybody. Remember, last year, when my friend Bruno went away? I'm sure I heard him talk to a lady no one saw. He came over to me with the lady. He had his canary on his shoulder. I was scared. I'm sure I'd shot the canary and it was dead, yet I saw it on his shoulder, singing. Bruno pointed to a star and said, "I'm going up there. I'll seem dead, but I won't be. " "I can't take my body along. It's too heavy. " He kissed me, and pointed to his star again. Then he went away. I must have dreamed it. I'd drunk a lot that night. But I often look at the star and hope he comes back soon. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. Lots of hugs and kisses. Respectfully. If you want, write to me here: Jean-Roger Roffi.
