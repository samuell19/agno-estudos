Who are you? Guo Xiaojuan, reporter for Central Daily News -This is letter of introduction. - Central Daily News? It is a Conservative newspaper that has criticised us before Hold your hats General Lui has told us about this He has left for a few days. Nobody knows where he is. Then I'll follow you Here are my pictures of the battle front at Pingxingguan. But I did not get any images of combat. All right Stay with us. -Lieutenant Zhao! -Yes, capatain! She will now follow you. You are responsible for her safety. What? Forward! Captain Cheng? Captain Chen where are we going? - Yanmenguan. - Yanmenguan? Then we're moving away from the battle front? No wonder people said you were trying to flee I think you are... In the countryside, we know that chicks do not piss. We have our own way. Chen. we no longer have the train And the Japanese are controlling Highway Zhengding-Taiyuan We are supposed to arrive at Yanmenguan before the 25th We'll never do that. Speed up. It must be done. Zhao Dali! Talking a stroll? Help her walk! I suggested it, but she refused. Help her! Go! Leave me alone Accept their help. I do not need help We have to be on time. You're slowing us down! It depends where you're going. If it is to Xinkou, where the Japanese and the battle front are. I'll make it even if I crawl. We have our mission. Chicks do not piss. Captain, I don't want to take care of her. - I'll take care of her. - I am not with anyone! Throw her into the trench! You... You are undermining the unity of the front. Tietou! Go and fetch a stretcher. Carry her! Aren't we supposed to throw her into the trench? Enemy planes! Hurry! They're worse than flies! They're sticking us in the ass. - Besides fleeing, what are you doing? - Avoiding giving you a bath. I'd prefer a bath! Captain, I didn't do it on purpose. Don't you dare! Captain! Captain! Can I stop carrying it? Hurry! Hurry! Bunch of bastards! We have no transmitter. We' ve become deaf and mute. Advisor, are we far from Yixiantian? Not at all. The 1st Batalion... go to Yixiantian by road. You will be exposed to enemy fire. They will come. 1st and 2nd companies, move ahead. The 3rd with me. Follow me. Hurry! Hurry! Where are these soldiers? They have guts. I'm going to have fun. Go! Climb the hill! Don't linger! Why are these planes so large today? True They are larger than the ones we saw at the station They come in different sizes? Of course, you idiot! There are sparrows and eagles. Eagles are large. Sparrows are small. They snore louder than the planes we saw two days ago. They make me deaf. It's not so loud. You're kidding! Look! They're disappearing over there. A few days ago, they were flying high. Today they are closer. So they make more noise. It's that simple! Advisor. Starting from tomorrow, we will rest during the daytime and walk at night. Very good. This way we'll avoid enemy aircraft. Without a transmitter, we have no contact with the command post. The route to Xinkou is before us. The enemy is there. Captain Chen! Captain Chen. You're going further from the battle front? It was done by those planes. Is that your theory? You know how to kill a pig? By the throat or the back, it's your choice. Captain. Keep practising until you can shoot down a plane Yes! Where's your sergeant? There. Being monitored. You know what a plane is? You cannot shoot it down. You don't know anything. The captain said I could. Bravo! You're being punished on your own for desertion! You admit your wrongdoings? You're not talking to me? Captain! I've been going out out for years. We went to my house. I went to see my mother. I have not defected. - Why didn't you ask for permission' - You'd never have agreed! So you quietly deserted? A veteran of the Long March? And you're ridiculed at the station! You're really good for nothing! How is your mother? Very well I have a mission? How do you Know? Or you'll forgive me? So? Tell me. The nest of enemy Planes is around the corner. The airfield? Work it out yourself. Find its exact location. - Ok. - Go ahead. Be discreet. Of course. Feidao! Come here. Captain! How's Guo? She has a fever. I gave her a blanket. - Where is she? - She's lying there. She has a high fever. I'm cold. Go and get the nurse. - Zhao Dali! - Captain... Speak! You touched her face. - I know. -You touched her! It is a skull. The skull of a woman! The skull of a friend of the army. Give her a bowl of hot soup. You have forbidden us from lighting a fire to avoid being a target. You are stubborn! Find a solution. Go! The skull? We have finally found it. I counted. There are 17 aircraft in all. Are you sure? Trus me I've been here for 24 hours. There are no more. Captain! It's dangerous! Thank you! The captain told me to bring it. Why do we sleep during the daytime and walk at night? To avoid being seen by the enemy. I can understand. You are too poorly equipped. You miss the experience of combat. If the enemy sees you. You will all be killed. We are not afraid to die. How old is he, your captain? Two years older than me. He's a really tough guy I have a question - What are the planes made of' - Iron. And they can fly Touch them at the airfield. You'll see. The Army of Jin-Sui said you wanted to defect. I do not believe it. You want to preserve your strength right? Can a hunter perservere his strength in a den of wolves? Are you a hunter? It's hard to tell. 20, 21 22, 23 Captain! There are 24 aircraft. But we do not know if there is other firepower. Isn't that Feidao? Yes! This land is mined. Tonight... try to enter through the back. if you cannot do it, then come back. Do not use a gun. Do not alert them. Sergeant... can we see what the planes are made of? When we get there, you can touch them. Who are you? I'm going to cut the wings off! Who is it? Attention. He is a certainly not alone. Look for his accomplices! Search! Let's go. That night, a commando was introduced into the airfield. They drew their sword, But they left without firing a shot. Tonight a commando was introduced into the airfield. They drew their sword. but they left without firing a shot. Sir... there are no Chinese troops here. They were probably civilians. Or... they were thieves looting from the airport? We do not need to go through Yanmenguan. Where, then? Where do the Japanese fear an attack? The Zhengding Taiyuan Road? Closer. Think again. Report! Captain! We went to the airfield. But we were surprised. The Japanese sleep in the bellies of the planes They are fighting in Xinkou and you're sleeping here. Do you know what that's called? Fleeing the battle! It is a misunderstanding I want to see the captain. Report! Come in! Adviser, telegram from the command post. - The transmitter was broken, right? -It has been repaired. We have tried our best. You can receive telegrams but not send them. They ask about our situation and why we didn't reply. Read it. "On 16th at 2:00 a.m. Japanese planes bombed our base" "The fight was very intense. We lost many men in our army" Four officers died. That's terrible. General asks, "Where is the 769th Regimen? "What is Chen Xilian going to do?" What do I want to do? I will bomb the airfield an destroy all their planes! - Guo wants to see you. - No way! Captain! A convoy of armoured enemies have left Yangmingpu and entered the airfield. ADVANCE STEP BY STEP TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING Captain, what should we do? Count the enemy at Yangmingpu, Daixian and Guoxiang. Also... locate their explosives. Got it. Captain, what is my mission? Tomorrow at 9:00 am, you will hide here with a company Their supply convoys will go through here. You hide here, steal their food and leave. Finally some action! Do it quickly and well! Yes! Chen! - You wanted to see me? - I want your opinion. Well, I'll give it. Chen, I have thought about it. We should follow our original plan. Obey the command post and go to Yanmenguan. The orders of General Liu are to reach Yanmenguan before the 25th. And prevent the enemy from sending reinforcements to Xinkou. We have already lost two days. We disobeyed orders. According to our information, the airfield is very secure. Around the airfield, near Yangmingpu, Daixian and Gouxiang. there are elite Japanese soldiers. As for our 3,000 men, they are armed with old shotguns. swords and spears. Chen... you don't break stones with eggs. On the other hand, our men are survivors from the Long March. They are the jewels of the Party. We cannot sacrifice them and make them martyrs. Reportedly the airfield is located 20 km from Yangmingpu. between the villages of Banzhengpu and Xiaorujie. The are mountains on three sides. To the south is the Hutuo River. The Japanese have enhanced security. Their headquarters are based in Yangmingpu. With soldiers in Guoxiang and Daixian, there are 9,000 men They can get to the airfield quickly for now, we do not know much about the equipment and men at the airfield. How long does it take for them to get from Yangmingpu to the airfield? one hour. Otherwise, you can shoot one or two aircraft in Dongshan and later send them shells. The scope is so short that we wouldn't even reach Dongshan. And even if it works, we have only seven rouns. I say, let's fight! You have decided? Let's go. Comrades... their planes threaten us every day. Up in the air we can do nothing against them. But now... we've found their nest. it is a godsend. True, our equipent is worse than theirs. But we are Chinese soldiers of the Army of the 8th Route. If we have a good plan, We can destroy their planes before their reinforcements arrive This is the best help we can bring to Xinkou. General Liu would have done the same. If I must die in Yangmingpu I am proud. Let's go! Let's go! Get in! Hurry! Lieutnant! He died of fear. Sir, this was not the official army. but he was a trained commando. However given the sockets which were found on site, they are poorly armed. You're sure he was a Chinese commando? -They have stolen the food? - Yes, apparently This road that leads to Xinkuo is vital. The slightes error on our part would be fatal. Do not repeat the disaster at Pingxingguan. Yes, of course. Sir, the unit guarding the airfield should carry out patrols on the road. I agree. Send the following order: Find these people immediately. Yes. Captain Chen! Captain, I wrote an article. Please give me your opinion. I am an eagle without wings? Most of the time the eagle does not fly in the sky it stands on the cliff. He looks at the sky in silence. Who knows what he thinks? But you think about him. It's very poetic. But what has it got to do with me? There is a foreign proverb which says: "The eagle that flies highest does not count on its wings but on its faith" It's you. I like eagles. You like eagles? I will catch one for you after the war. It is a colleague. It is not dangerous. Is it a reconnaissance plane? It keeps turning. They have noticed. Perfect! Let's have some fun Fun? You're going to tease them at Yangmingpu To confuse them? -Right. This is our especialty. - Be careful. - Yes - I'll go with him. - Stay here. - What do I do? - You're going fishing. Hutuo River is a natural barrier. They will never think were can enter there. You see the grass there? The water is not deep there. But the mud may be deeper. I prefer it not to be deep. Go ahead and inspect the bottom of the water. What are you doing here? I just take pictures. It's dangerous Stay here. What are you doing? I'm fishing. Go ahead. What are you waiting for? Captain... What is he doing? Army supplies are poor. Many soldiers wear only trousers. He's not wearing underwear? I wont photograph your buttocks. No. Captain... Otherwise, I will. Well, let her photograph my buttocks. We are not afraid to die. We may well show our butts. Take photos! You're going to fish here. I'll go a little higher. Do not alert them. OK. Tietou! Protect the captain. It's hot. I want a good bath. You certainly smell bad! You have a beatuiful face, but frankly... Surely there are fish. And perhaps ducks. We could catch them and roast them. Good idea! Look over there! Captain! We walked along the river. We didn't find anything. - Captain! - Zhao! Zhao! You're back! Dali! I thought you were dead! You... You saw they shot a me. So I dived under. When I came back up, there were three Japanese men in the water. I immediately spotted their guns on the shore. Captain! I bring you three good guns. Zhao Dali, listen to me. I don't even care if you bring me three planes! What's happening? Hello... Yes. Understood. Strangers have attacked the camp entrance. The portal has been destroyed and there are people dead It's that damm commando. - Did you catch them? - They have disappeared. What do they want from us? Whoever they are, Whatever their purpose, do not let them aproach the airfield or the road. Search within a radius of 50 km. around the airport and the road. Find them and kill them all. Yes! The Japanese are bastards! They do not find us and then they kill civilians. Captain. These bastards... I will fight until the end! We're going to Yanmenguan! - And the airfield? - We are not fighting! Forward! Wang! Take the trail with the 1st and 2nd Company. The 3rd Company take the road to Yixiantian with me. We're going to show ourselves. Captain, Guo has disappeared. Find her! We have already looked everywhere. Hurry! Hurry! Here's the news. Two Chinese companies are moving towards Yanmenguan. One is running along the mountains, the other is taking the road. Should we continue or ignore them? They must be decimated! We will decimate them! Our primary mission is to defend the road and airfield. Another company will be responsible for removing them. Captain, have you bribed the Japanese? Instead of attacking us, their planes have scorted us! You should learn from me. Captain! - Captain! - So? The son of Guo was indeed a captain in the Army of Jin-Sui He returned with his arms when his regiment was disbanded. And hs father participed in the renovation of the Yangmingpu airfield. I want to see the old Guo. We are not going to Yanmenguan? What do you think? Stop! Turn around! Go to Sulongkou by the trails! Why are we turning back? It's a ruse. Turn around. Run! Turn around. Go to Sulongkou! Captain Chen wants to see Mr Guo. - Prepare our men. - It's done. We follow the plan. Please enter. - We have already met. - At the Daniu Station. We met there. Captain Chen! Glad to see you! There. Welcome to my house. Here is my father, my brother. It is Captain Chen Xilian of the Army of the 8th Route. Nice to meet you! Hello, Mr Guo. You are in mourning. My mother was killed on the road toTaiyuan By Japanese bombs. Ziyun, offer a seat to our guest. Sit. Take a cigarrete. They are not bad. Very good! What is the purpose of your visit? I am seeking your help to fight the Japanese and stop their arrogance. Captain, your intention is commendable. But under fire, it is civilians who pay. I'll be frank. You refuse to fight. But your wife has not been spared. I thought like you. But if the Central Army and the Jin-Sui Army failed... with your army so poorly equipped... That's why I've come here, to borrow your weapons. I learned that Mr. Guo had renovated the Yangmingpu airfield. Could you describe its configuration? Captain Chen, your leadership moves me. But you will leave after the battle. While our village will suffer any reprisals. To ensure peace for my village. I can only try to lay low. The Japanese, the Kuomintang, the Communists... I do not want to deal with anyone. I cannot. Captain Chen, do not put me in difficulty. Ziyun, take care of our guest. Captain Chen, thank you for coming to see me. I am honoured to have met you. Captain Chen... I am a little tired. Excuse me. - Ziyun! - Yes. Treat our guest nicely. Yes. Let's drink more! Captain Chen! Thank you for lending us your train. - Captain Guo, don't mention it. - Cheers! More! Go on! Thank you for your hospitality. Cheers! Another! What are you doing here? Go to the entrance instead. Come on. Cheers! Cheers! Master, the Japanese! Hello. You... Let's go. I came today for three reasons. Firs, Mr. Guo, you are someone well respected in the region. We also know you have studied in Japan. Therefore you are our friend. So I came to show you my respects. Secondly I'd like you to accept the post of governor. And finally, your son has left the Army of Jin-Sui And retired to his hometown with arm and ammunition. We would like him to joino ur security forces to ensure peace in the region. I... I do not require an immediate response from you I am leaving now. My respects. Left turn! Quick march! Mr. Guo. In order to beat the Japanese, I was insentitive. Excuse me. Bye. So long. Sir. leave the village as soon as possible. Father, we have a problem. A big problem. Chen Xilian took all our arms and ammunition. Grab it! - Is it enough? - No. You want more? Captain Chen! Captain Chen! - You're back? - On behalf of my father. Is he OK? He went to Taiyuan. Thank your father for me. Captain! Lieutenant. - Lieutenant! - What? What did Guo give the Captain? He looks happy. - A sentimental letter. - A sentimental letter? Those who are educated love it. What is a sentimental letter? It is a lover letter. You understand nothing. A love letter? Secretary! Advisor! Come here! OK. Chen, what's up? The plan of the airfield. Look! It's weird. It does not look like what we saw. This is the Yanxishan airfield renovation plan a few years ago. The Japanese must have redeveloped the airfield since. Chen, otherwise... They have already been alerted. We attack tonight before they are ready. OK. OK. The 3rd Battalion will come whit me to attack the airfield. The 1st Battalion will attack reinforcements. The 2nd Battalion will position itself at the south of Sulongkou. You take the lead. The 4th and 7th Company will destroy the roads to Yangmingpu, stop the Japanese army and protect the 3rd Battalion. You take the lead. Ok. The mortars will sit at the south of Hutuo River and provide reinforcement for the 4th and 7th Company. Chen! Let me attack. You do not trust me? - I'm afraid... - Let me attack. Captain! Our men are ready. When we have launched the attack, hold the enemy at Wangtongpu for 90 minutes. As long as live, the Japanese will not pass Wangtongpu. You have to stay alive. Right turn! Forward! Captain, the suicide squad is ready. - Do you have brothers? - one. - You still have your mother? - Yes. - Leave the ranks. - Why? To your mother. Leave the ranks! Leave the ranks. Leave the ranks. Captain! I still have a brother. It's true. You do not know everything about me. Join the ranks. Yes. Good. Let's go. See you later. Captain, I'm coming with you. I'll take pictures of you killing the enemy. But you can't enter the airfield. Stay with the secretary at the command post. Yes! Right turn! Forward! Captain Chen! Where is Guo? This is no fun! Liar! You have a brother? Keep quiet. Captain... If I die, please take care of my mother. Let's attack. Liu told me there are Japanese soldiers in the aircraft. Attack! Come on! The gun! Zhao Dali! Get to the nest! Attack! Lieutenant! Zhao needs help! Hurry! Captain! Tanks! Come with me! Take cover! Beware of gas! That armour protecs Building 1! Swing the barrels of gasoline at them. Fire! Do not let them approach the planes! Captain! Come! Go! You want to die? Stay here. I'll come and pick you up. All right? Guniang! Guniang! Are you all right? The 3rd Company will assist Litenant Zhao. Blow the plane. The rest follow me. Where are they all coming from? Push the tank! Captain! Blow the plane! Don't worry about me! Lieutenant, I will. Tietou! Reporter Guo... Guniang! Guniang! Reporter Guo... Guniang! What is a love letter? Guniang! Liu... You were right. Planes... are not made of iron. Lieutenant! Captain! I got three. Zhao Dali! Captain! Shit! Cover the captain! Captain! Captain Chen! Captain! On october 19th, 1937 led by Captain Chen Xilian, the 769th Regiment of the 129th Division of the Army of the 8th Route attacked the Japanese airfield at Yangmingbao in Shanxi Province. 24 Japanese planes were destroyed and 160 enemy soldiers were killed. During the attack, Lieutenant Zhao and 3 soldiers died for the country. The victory at the Yangmingbao airfield strongly bolstered the Xinkou Battle. It was another great success for our army after the huge victory at Pingxinguan. It broke the legendary invincibility of the Japanese Army again. It was a huge inspiration for the army and the Chinese people.
