Fawlty Towers is arguably the funniest sitcom of all time. In terms of construction and delivery of laughter, it is pretty much unequalled, I think. Whatever age you were, everybody thought it was funny. It was totally unique. Trying to impress the illuminati of Torquay and watching it all fall apart is agonising, beautiful and wonderful. And at Fawlty Towers, anything could fall apart. Mr Moose is up! It's done, done, done. It's up. It's down again. The situations that he's in, and these amazing lines, which I still remember nearly all of today. I mean, I've got those 12 episodes stencilled on my head. We watched in hysterics as the world's worst hotelier got himself into the most impossible positions... both socially and physically. I don't know how he does it. He manages to get his feet flat on the ground whilst his bum is practically touching the ground, and he's got his hands behind the back of his head. He's an acrobat. He's a dancer. He's a Nureyev of comedy. And an artist when it comes to slapstick. Really, Andre, he's wonderful! This Basil's wife. This Basil. This smack on head. The cast is just solid gold. Put this combo of people together, you're of course gonna produce absolute magic on screen. He put Basil in the ratatouille?! Yes! Ah! He's from Barcelona. I think what John wanted to do was a perfect comedy, and John believes in perfection. John Cleese is one of the most accomplished comedians to walk planet Earth, matching a brilliant comedy brain with a unique physical ability to make us all laugh. CHRISTOPHER BIGGINS: He was tall, he was lugubrious. The whole movement of the man was extraordinary. Everything is perfect about that man comedically. In Monty Python, Cleese wrote and performed in the most influential and funniest sketches of all time... Hello, Polly! ..some of which involved the abuse of stuffed animals. Wakey-wakey! Rise and shine! MICHAEL PALIN: 'A lot of the sketches that I played with John 'were customer and shopkeeper.' And it was always the shopkeeper who was the rather mild-mannered, irritating person, who won the battle in the end. Cleese's tall, patrician appearance made him the perfect authority figure in ground-breaking, iconic satirical skits, where he could abuse those socially beneath him. I look down on him because I am upper class. I look up to him because he is upper class. But I look down on him because he is lower class. I am middle class. I know my place. John Cleese could play upper-class toffs like nobody else. In something like the old Frost Report sketch, "I look down on him" and all of those different things about the nature of the upper class, he is in charge. The great skill John had, of course, was to play these great authority figures, but undermine them. It's that sort of wonderful juxtaposition between authority and silliness, which he did so well. Many of you will have already heard the tragic news about Newton, our faithful old retainer. He fell to his death early yesterday morning... from his bed. Poor, dear old Newton. And so I am giving the second form the entire morning off school in his memory. Get the spades from me and the body from Matron. Someone like David Frost, who, of course, was a great alchemist of comedy in the 1960s, he would see people, whether it was The Two Ronnies, whether it was multiple people who ended up in Python, he would see them and think, "Yeah, these are people who I need to be working with, "because they're brilliant." Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, working on a so-called children's show, but very anarchic for a children's show, called Do Not Adjust Your Set. John Cleese and Graham Chapman had been doing At Last The 1948 Show, Rediffusion. And Barry Took, whose job it was at the BBC to bring comedy to the masses, sort of brought those two factors together and became Monty Python's Flying Circus. Their concoction of intellectual surrealism paired with the downright daft heralded a comedy revolution across the world, with Cleese at the centre of it all. If you look at Cleese's performance in Monty Python, he's not the kind of fragile character that Basil is, he's the very straitlaced announcer, who speaks straight down the barrel of the camera of all of these absurdities, and the joke is that he is unflappable. And now for something completely different. An occasional supporting actor on Python was Cleese's wife, Connie Booth, an American writer and performer he'd met in New York in 1964. Connie was a regular attender at the recordings, and you can hear her, cos she laughs... Connie, with this sort of... GASPS ..intake of breath. She doesn't laugh out, she sort of... GASPS And Booth wasn't afraid to get into the ring with Cleese comedically, dangerously throwing herself about to get a laugh. COMMENTATOR: I can see nothing wrong with one healthy man beating the living daylights out of a little schoolgirl. Her intuitive sort of style, with Cleese particularly, just sparkles on camera, so she really blossomed. Python's surreal concepts often demanded unusual locations. Filming a spoof of Scott Of The Antarctic, but set in the Sahara Desert, the Pythons needed a beach, and so headed to the south coast, armed with inappropriate clothing and a stuffed lion. And it was here, while shooting this bizarre sketch on a beach in Torquay, where Cleese found his inspiration for an irate hotelier who hated his guests. The roots of Fawlty Towers are in this experience that the whole Monty Python team had booking into this hotel, run by a Mr Sinclair. MICHAEL PALIN: I remember saying, "Can we have an alarm call?" "Yes, yes, yes." "And... perhaps a cup of tea or some..." "Tea?!" And it was all that sort of stuff. And then, you know, "What time do you want it?" "Well... erm... We have to leave at seven." "Seven?! Seven?!" "Seven o'clock?!" I mean, he was absolutely just like Fawlty. Everything seemed to... Everything to do with hotels and what the essence of hotels was was something that he didn't want to deliver. He took Eric Idle's briefcase and threw it over a wall, thinking it was a bomb. And when one of them said, "Why do you think someone would try to blow up the hotel?" he just went, "Well, we've had staffing problems." Graham, Terry and myself just couldn't take it. We thought, "We can't stay here a moment longer." So we went somewhere else. We could not believe that John had decided to stay on. And now we realise what a great move it was to stay there. And he must have been just filling the notebook at night with all these wonderful Sinclair-isms. It wasn't long before a caricature of Sinclair appeared on our screens. John Cleese was working on a show called Doctor At Large, and he wrote an episode called No Ill Feelings. And there is a character in that that's played by Timothy Bateson who is basically sort of the prototype for Basil Fawlty. It is a hotel proprietor who treats every single request made by a guest as an absolute affront. Cereal? No, thanks, just... Kipper or sausage? Would the kipper be quick? I beg your pardon? Would the kipper be quicker? Well, it'll be as quick as it can be. It can't be quicker than that, can it? It's quite exciting, isn't it, to see that little moment when you go, "Something that became absolutely an iconic sitcom series "started with this little scene."? I think it was a very unusual choice after Monty Python to do essentially a farce like Fawlty Towers. And I think that was quite a common view. Famously, they wrote the first episode and handed it in to the BBC commissioning executive, who sent them back this excoriating note. "I'm afraid I find this one as dire as the title. "It's a sort of Prince Of Denmark of the hotel world, "a collection of cliches and stock characters "that I can't see being anything but a disaster." Oh, dear, oh, dear. That's shocking. As terrible mistakes go, I mean, that is right up there with turning down the Beatles, but, I mean, thank goodness somebody saw sense at the BBC. A series of six was eventually commissioned, and Cleese's comedic tour de force came to life in all its madcap glory. Ah! I'd never seen anything like this weird, lanky tall guy before, who was just rude to everyone, such an arrogant snob, and yet, you couldn't help but like him. At 9pm on Friday, the 19th of September 1975, Fawlty Towers opened to the viewing public... CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ..welcoming us in with this unorthodox classical refrain, a world away from your standard sitcom theme tune. It didn't feel like a normal sitcom opening. It was very genteel. SINGS THEME TUNE Not of its time. It's not '70s. And then you close in on the sign, and you see someone has reordered it, and if it says, "flowery twats", it's made it quite rude. So before you've even got through the door of the hotel, you know what this is about. You're starting with a good laugh, and usually, they were. "Fatty owls" and stuff like that. It's just so silly. But nothing will beat "farty towels." You later find out that it's the paperboy who's been moving the letters around. Because obviously, Basil's horrible to him, and that's his little revenge. Everything in that show is kind of precision-engineered to be funny. In the hands of writers John Cleese and Connie Booth, even the mundanity of checking out would have us cracking up. Goodbye, Mrs Fawlty. Goodbye, Mr Firkin. Satisfied customer. We should have him stuffed. I think making it as simple and a clear and tight environment as he did was very, very clever. And cheap, probably. But, you know, it worked. It worked very well. Fawlty Towers is set in a world that is in many, many ways incredibly familiar to you. And then you put in all these eccentric characters into it. It just produces something incredibly magical. Manuel! From the outset, it was clear this was no ordinary hotel, with owner Basil and Spanish waiter Manuel forced to communicate through minimal words and casual violence, resulting in chaos for all. Que? Throw it away. Throw it away. Throw it away. Now! Throw it... Oh! So you immediately think whatever's supposed to be happening here isn't happening. And whatever order someone's trying to impose has collapsed. At the heart of all the disorder was Basil Fawlty. Every single request made by a guest is treated as the most terrible infringement of Basil Fawlty's time. What's happened to the old idea of doing something for your fellow man? Of service? I mean, today, people just... Mr Fawlty? Yes, I'm coming! I'm coming! Wait a moment! He makes reference to riff-raffs, yobbos, and this sort of... the sadness of the character. His whole life, he is being forced to be polite to people who he perceives as being beneath him. So then, when you bring someone in from the outside who is actually of proper class, all of a sudden, everything goes out the window and he is the most important thing in the room. And that's very clever, because that is what creates the comic situation. Would you put both your names, please? Well, would you give me a date? I only use one. You don't have a first name? No, I'm Lord Melbury, so I simply sign "Melbury". Go away. I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting, your Lordship. I do apologise. Please do accept my forgiveness. Now, is there something... something, anything, that I can do for you? Anything? Almost the moment that John Cleese starts to ingratiate himself with anyone in any of the episodes, we almost automatically know that he's been taken in. There's a facile nature to Basil Fawlty that means that those he will be impressed by are more often than not those that will screw him. Indeed, Melbury is a conman, and Basil is appalled when Sybil opens the safe to check the bogus Lord's valuables, which leads to one of the funniest reveals in sitcom history. There's a couple of moments where Fawlty can't handle what's happened. He doesn't do a sort of immediate... immediate action and then just... casually sniffs them. I think that... I mean, that's a skill John has. He looks at them and then he shakes them by his ear. He's able to play at a very, very sort of almost stationary, minimal level. And the next moment, he's gone completely mad. How are you, then? All right, mate? How's me old mucker? Any valuables to deposit, Sir Richard? Any bricks, or... I do apologise. You bastard! The moment he realises that, in fact, he's taken himself for a ride, his anger will immediately be spent through slapstick. MICHAEL LAUGHING: It flows out of him. Yet again, he's got it wrong. And it's the class system and, you know, these wonderful... I think he still believes, though he's a conman, he's Lord so-and-so. He still wants to believe that. CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS One of Basil's schemes to put Fawlty Towers on the social map is to serve haute cuisine to Torquay's high society. Cordon bleu was everywhere, so we pick up those old 1970s cookbooks, and you see these ridiculous shanks of lamb decorated to look like a nose, or whatever it was, and glace cherries and pieces of pineapple thrown everywhere. In the episode Gourmet Night, Basil's bright idea is to attract Torquay's social elite to sample the culinary delights of Fawlty Towers, which naturally ends in unmitigated disaster. The beauty of Gourmet is that right at the beginning, we know that his car is playing up, so the audience instantly knows that there's gonna be a problem with the car. Just pull yourself together, all right? Make an effort! 'The car is one of Basil's enemies.' You know, it's joined all the people who work in the hotel as another thing that is out to get Basil. The tension is ratcheted up for the viewers, and as one catastrophe follows another, Basil is forced to race across town to fetch gourmet meals for his guests. And at the very pinnacle of this "high" drama, the inevitable happens. ENGINE SPUTTERS Come on! And then you have him beating up the car in that classic, classic, classic scene that everybody remembers. I'm gonna give you a damn good thrashing! It's a magnificent moment - the way it's shot, the timing, the performance. We know it's ridiculous what he's doing, that a man's thrashing his car, but we've all been there. My first car was a Morris Marina and broke down all the time, and I was like, "I'm gonna beat the shit out of my car!" SHE LAUGHS And he does it for you. It's brilliant. After frantically running back with the gourmet meal, Basil finally gets to present the posh nosh, but in typical Fawlty style, the tension builds, making the comic reveal even more excruciatingly intense for the viewer. And he looks, and it's not duck, it's some sort of trifle. He puts it down again, and then he lifts it off as if it would've changed. It's the most painful episode to watch, and comedy sometimes has to be painful. Duck's off. Sorry. It's a perfect half hour of comedy. While Basil had nothing but contempt for anyone beneath him, his most acerbic comments, and often the most imaginative and witty when it came to sticking the knife in, were aimed in the direction of his wife, Sybil. What are you on about? I wish you would help a bit. You're always refurbishing yourself. What? Oh, never mind. Never mind! Don't shout at me. I've had a difficult morning. Oh, dear, what happened? Did you get entangled in the eiderdown again, hm? Not enough cream in your eclair? Or did you have to talk to all your friends for so long you didn't have time to perm your ears? 'How he and Sybil got together, I don't really know.' LAUGHING: Nor does he seem to, either. Pre-Fawlty Towers, Prunella Scales had appeared in everything from sitcoms to Greek tragedies, and even had a stint as a bus conductress in Corrie in 1962. When she was offered the role, from a shortlist of 15, Scales wanted to explore who Sybil really was. Prunella Scales, being the wonderful professional, went off and invented a tale of her being sort of lower middle class and seeing Cleese as this sort of authority figure and quite upper class. And having aspirations to run a restaurant or hotel and seeing the possibility with Basil, and love sparkled, and everything else. So that's why Prunella Scales as Sybil comes across as so reasonable. She's got that idea in her head that they loved each other once. But when it came to running the hotel, Sybil was clearly the boss, ruling with caustic authority and biting sarcasm, dished out in perfectly timed, pithy one-liners. Look, I was here first. Well, it's my turn now, then. I fought in the Korean War, you know. I killed four men. He was in the catering corps. He used to poison them. Basil is fearful of Sybil. That's the key thing, is fear. The dread that she'll find out that he's bet on the horse, Dragonfly. If I find out the money on that horse was yours, you know what I'll do, Basil. You'll have to sew 'em back on first! There's a guy who's been thoroughly emasculated, and he... she's policing him, so he genuinely worries about her reaction to things. In the episode where the Australian girl shows up, you can actually see elements of, "Hang on a minute. "I may not be able to stand Basil, but he's mine, "and you need to know that he's mine." So, the dynamics were really cleverly put together. I just popped in to have a look at these hinges. You know, the ones we've... Do you really imagine, even in your wildest dreams, that a girl like this could possibly be interested in an ageing, brilliantined stick insect like you? So, it's lovely when something kind of happens where a character does something a little bit unusual and shows a quality, like jealousy, that you didn't think would actually be there. With his own sex life seemingly non-existent... It sort of comes across in his frustration with everything that happens. I mean, you can tell that he's not getting a lot of it. ..Basil's Victorian values ensure when an unmarried couple check in, he's morally outraged. Now, what's going on here? Well, I can't give you a double room, then. Oh, look... It's against the law. What law? The law of England. Nothing to do with me. "Nothing to do with you"? Nothing at all. I can give you two singles, if you like... You get the idea that this guy's such a prude because he's so sexually frustrated himself, so he becomes quite sort of puritanical, where it suits him. In contrast to Basil was Mr Johnson, the faux-Mediterranean, leather-trousered medallion man played by Nicky Henson. That wonderful scene with Nicky Henson, as the sort of swinger character, who Basil thinks of as a kind of throwback, you know, a kind of evolutionary throwback. He makes jokes about him being a Neanderthal or a caveman, so that shows his snobbery, but what he's really showing is his envy. Are you dining here tonight, here in this unfashionable dump? Well, I wasn't planning to. No, not really your scene, is it? I thought I'd try Italian. Anywhere you'd recommend? Oh, what sort of food were you thinking of? Fruit, or...? Erm, anywhere they do French food? Yes, France, I believe. They seem to like it there. He does those ape noises, and it's really an argument about virility and Basil's fear of sexual inadequacy. Good evening. Good evening. HE MIMICS APE Oh, that's a lot better. Nicky Henson, kind of the opposite of John Cleese - you know, a sexually potent man who enjoys his life and is cool. He's the anti-Basil. It might help to think of Basil as a man who never quite had his chance of participating in the sexual revolution, because nobody asked him, really. To be honest, it wouldn't be much fun having sex with Basil Fawlty. Fawlty Towers has become synonymous with appalling standards, poor service and chaotic situations, and while Basil Fawlty was usually the one responsible, things were only made worse by lovable but totally inept Spanish waiter Manuel. The two of them together producing some of the most painful and hilarious scenes in sitcom history. Get a clean one. It's clean now! "He's from Barcelona" - his wonderful three words which just, you know, come up so often. "He's all right. He's all right. He's from Barcelona." To me, it's a quite strong observation on the attitudes of someone like that - post-war era, post-imperial, still dreams we're the greatest country in the world, how their attitude was to foreigners. Oh! What are you doing?! I'm so sorry. He's from Barcelona. 'Nobody understands Basil. His wife doesn't understand him.' And yet he's forced to communicate with someone who can't speak English. There is too much butter on those trays. No! No, no, senor. What? Not, "on, those, trays." No, sir. Uno, dos, tres. Making him not understand English was a masterstroke because then you can go straight into physical comedy. Clean... Clean. ..the windows. BASIL SIGHS Argh! MANUEL BABBLES Morning, Fawlty. Morning, Major. The window, see. Look, clean the windows. Ah! Si, comprende, comprende, comprende. To see them rehearsing together, you could just see them sparking off each other, inspiring one another. I think one of the things about John Cleese and Andrew Sachs together is it does have... it has the violence of great silent-movie and early-sound slapstick. Come here. Eh? You're a waste of space. Oh! Every time a spoon hits a head, you can feel it. They are the ultimate comedy double act, if you think about it, and unfortunately, because they're in a sitcom, they don't get, you know, pulled out like that, but that is what they are. You could just imagine Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy doing exactly those set pieces. Manuel, let me explain. Argh! You've got two brilliant physical-comedy performers doing this absolutely ridiculous stuff. And he grabs Andrew Sachs, smashes his head against the wall. MANUEL SQUEALS I mean, we can see that it's not a real wall, but who cares? The violence to Manuel is incredible, and these days, you'd get cancelled for that. If you look at the old silent movies, which I know John Cleese was a massive fan of, there's a lot of really hard-hitting stuff because that's what got the bigger laughs. You know, when the person fell, they really fell on their backside. If they climbed or were hit on the back of the head by a ladder, it really looked like they were hit hard, so it needed that, and that creates that kind of manic energy. In one scene, mistaking Manuel for a burglar, Basil grabs for a weapon, but as you can hear, as he hits him across the head... PAN CLANGS Oh! ..the pan was real. Famously, properly hurt him because he hit him around the head with a saucepan. I mean, that... that was real. He wasn't given a prop saucepan. That was a real saucepan, and he bashed him round the head with it. One of the really good things about Fawlty Towers, you watch that and you do know, "Yes, that actually did hurt." It is crazy. Talk about suffering for your art. In the Fawlty dysfunctional family, the one calm head was Polly, the long-term waitress-cum-maid -cum-problem-solver. Polly is an art student, who they have fortuitously hired. She is the only person on the premises who actually has a scrap of sense and knows what she's doing. Connie, both as the character she played and the way she wrote it, softened it up a bit. One good thing about actors who write is that they always give themselves a decent part, and it's often forgotten that this is a John Cleese and Connie Booth writing credit. That makes it fantastic because Connie Booth as Polly is one of the great supporting characters. What's that smell? Flowers. I just got them from the garden. What are you stinking the place out with those for? What's happened to the plastic ones? They're being ironed (!) Connie Booth, who never, as far as I'm concerned, gets enough praise, she takes the one real piece of sanity that exists in Fawlty Towers, which of course is not... comedically, is not rewarding, but is necessary, because if everyone was mad, then the thing becomes overwhelming. Often, Sybil is in between them, and poor Polly has been roped in to whatever crazy scheme that Basil has come up with in order to get himself out of trouble. When Polly is interrogated by Sybil for having a wad of cash, her quick wit allows her to decipher Basil's over-the-top charade so she can pretend she'd won it on a horse. No, not fish! Small! Fly! Fly! Flying Tart! No! No, no! It got off to a flying START, and its name... SHAKILY: ..was Dragonfly. Thank you, Polly. She would put herself on the line for him, and no-one... You don't know why, really. It's the mutual respect of the two creators, the actors, the writers, into those characters. And it shows that there's a woman doing the writing on this show as well as John Cleese, because men write women quite badly. Virtually every female character is either a dragon or she's a girl being all flirty and all... you know, being all sexy, and there was a chance that Polly could have been that, and she isn't. And in contrast to the off-screen husband-and-wife relationship, on screen, Basil treats Polly as a cynical father would treat a daughter. Yes? A single for tonight, is it? Mr Fawlty, may I introduce Richard Turner. I'm sorry? He's a friend of mine. Oh, you know each other, do you? 'He never flirts with her at all.' I think cos they were married in real life. You can't write the characters to have a flirtation, then it takes over the whole thing. But one brief hint of their home life did slip into one scene, when Basil does an impression of the English maid using Connie Booth's native North American accent. He does an impression of Polly, but he doesn't do an impression of Polly, he does an impression of Connie Booth. Don't play dumb with me. I trusted you. You're responsible for this. AMERICAN, SHRILLY: Oh, I've got a friend who'll look after him, Mr Fawlty! I often wonder whether he just accidentally slipped into being John Cleese in that moment, but it's lovely. In the 1970s, the service in British hotels was far more basic than it is today. You used to go into these hotels and smell the cabbage burning downstairs, you know. I mean, it was just awful. However, in the US, it was a very different story. REPORTER: New York has more hotel rooms than some countries have people. If you want to settle for the best, you'll find the hotel is a self-contained city. 'Americans had the best hotels, the best service industries.' Everything was so professional and slick. To highlight the contrast between the two service industries, Cleese and Booth created Mr and Mrs Hamilton - a brash, no-nonsense Yank and English wife, whose requests are highly incompatible with the way things are usually run at Fawlty Towers. Thank you. Do we need to reserve a table for dinner? Dinner? Yes. Problem? Well, it is after nine. So? Well, we do actually stop serving at nine. Nine? Well, if you could go straight in... We've just driven five hours to get here! We'd like to freshen up, maybe have a drink first, you know? Yes. You couldn't do that afterwards? Do what? Well... Have our drink-before-dinner after dinner, freshen up and go to bed? Well, if you could, it would make things easier for us. Shall we go to bed now? Would that make it easier for you? Temper-wise, they're both like powder barrels ready to go off, and I think that's where the great comedy in that episode lies. Carrying the flag for the American service industry was Bruce Boa, who would go on to star in The Empire Strikes Back and Full Metal Jacket. You know exactly what sort of character you're going to get from Bruce Boa, and he plays it with such anger and aggressiveness. How much of this Mickey Mouse money do you want to keep the chef on for half an hour? One, two, three, £20, huh? That enough? I'll see what I can do. Thank you. And, of course, Terry, the chef, he's not sticking around, he's gone. Basil now has to make a Waldorf salad without knowing what a Waldorf salad is. And a hilarious opportunity to show off his masterful ignorance when it comes to international cuisine. Could you make me a Waldorf salad? Oh, er... A Wal... Waldorf salad. Well, I think we're just out of Waldorfs. LAUGHTER I do remember one day John Cleese coming over to the rest of us, sitting, and saying, "Isn't he just brilliant?" Because he was so impressed with the seriousness of the way he did it. Well, that was what made it so funny. Playing it straight as the angry American, Bruce Boa is in perfect contrast to the manic performance Cleese gives in trying to convince the guests the chef they paid for is still in the kitchen. AS TERRY: I was making another Waldorf... Making another Waldorf salad?! What are you making another Waldorf salad for? AS TERRY: Careful, Mr Fawlty, I'm only a little fella! What do you think Mr and Mrs Hamilton must think...? LAUGHTER Mr Hamilton, may I introduce Terry Hu... LAUGHTER Where did he go? The non-existent chef is one of the funniest things ever, I think, and particularly when he's caught midway, when the... Mr Hamilton comes in and... I thought the double-take that John Cleese did there was brilliant. There are these moments when somebody who was less snobbish and less concerned with status than Basil would admit that there was some problem, but it's already clearly established, we know that Basil just can't do that. He simply can't do that. He has to keep going along these paths until he has got to this almost psychotic space. And it ends with him... He's got all the guests around him, and, you know, he's getting some of them to say, "No, we're happy with the service, perfectly happy with the service," but then it very quickly turns around, and everyone just starts listing off all the things that have gone terribly wrong. I'm not satisfied. No, we're not satisfied. Well, people like you never are, are you? What? What? The British don't complain. We're scared of complaining, we don't want to make a fuss, and we don't wanna cause any offence. It takes an American to start British people to start going, "Actually, no, I'm not satisfied," and actually standing up to him. And it's like he's opened a valve. And then you have this most extraordinary outburst from Basil Fawlty. Have you any idea of how much there is to do? Do you ever think of that? Of course not! You're too busy sticking your noses into every corner, poking about for things to complain about, aren't you? Well, let me tell you something! This is EXACTLY how Nazi Germany started. A lot of layabouts with nothing better to do! Again, it's just a perfect example of how Basil Fawlty shouldn't be anywhere near hospitality. Basil, you feel, should've perhaps been in a monastery, just somewhere where he could have a wooden board and bang his head against it a few times. Welcome back to our unauthorised celebration of Fawlty Towers. 12 perfectly crafted comedy farces, each of the plots is masterfully written to weave increasingly manic behaviour through scenes of escalating chaos, which drive viewers to hysterics and Basil to hysteria. Where is the key? I mean, would you believe it? I mean, would you believe it? The first time we've ever had a fire here in this hotel, and somebody's lost the key! I mean, isn't that typical of this place? Oh, thank you, God (!) Thank you so bloody much! LAUGHTER I'd love to have got into Cleese's head when he and Connie were writing this cos how did they keep that all up there? Every script was like a Bible. I mean, it was so thick. Allegedly three or four times thicker than any other half-hour script. It's absolutely mind-blowing that they were allowed to rock up with 135 to 140-page scripts. That's longer than a film. I've worked with John long enough to know that he goes over things again and again to work out why it's funny, how he can make it more funny. It's almost like he has a kind of, in his head, a pattern, a thesis, almost, of how he wants to play it. And that worked so well in Fawlty Towers. It actually produced this wonderfully choreographed... piece of madness. Long, intricate and perfectly timed physical setpieces were integral to keeping up the pace and developing the plot. Basil? Ah! LAUGHTER Look what you've done, you stupid great tart! Wait a minute. What? I think it'll be all right. Yes. Yes, you're right. Argh! LAUGHTER Look! Look at it! Look at it! I mean, look at that! Can I help, dear? Yes! Go and kill yourself. The thing about Fawlty Towers is it's constructed like a farce, like a stage play, which makes it different to almost every other sitcom. MICHAEL PALIN: John obviously understood farce. It's all about timing. Farce is something which you can really pin down where the laughs are gonna come, exactly how they're going to come, what move is going to provoke the laughter. When one of the guests dies, Basil, Polly and Manuel spend most of the episode trying to hide the body, often using comical, if unorthodox, methods to keep it under wraps. Murder! Murder! Slap her! Slap her! AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS, LAUGHS Oh, spiffing. Absolutely spiffing. Well done. Two dead, 25 to go. LAUGHTER DAVID QUANTICK: Farce is different to other kinds of comedy because it has very strong rules. Lots of deception. Generally, it's based on someone trying to hide something. There's confusion, mostly about identity. Mistaking somebody for somebody else, that's a big part of Fawlty Towers. When friends of the deceased guest, Mr Leeman, arrive, with him now in the laundry basket, Basil believes, at first, they are the coroners. And Polly has to save him with an inspired piece of wordplay. Oh, I see! Mr Leeman! Yes. We thought you said "the linen". Brilliant! Sorry, sorry. That's it. That's how farce works, you know. It's a series of misunderstandings, and then you have this kind of comical build-up, like a drum roll. Not only of the verbal jokes, but the physical slapstick comedy as well, to have this big climax at the end of the episodes. Could I get my hat? Your hat? Yes. It's just there. Yes, I'll have it sent on. What? Do you have a card with your address? I'll send it on. Well, could I just get it? Well... But do you have to have it now? The beauty of great farce is that you still want the people, however broken, strange and odd they are, you still want them to succeed. The episode Basil The Rat is another near-perfect example of farce. Seeds of the chaos to follow are cleverly planted with the introduction of what appears to be a new guest in the kitchen. Er, shall I get you the wine list? Mr Fawlty? "Mister?" Oh, please, call me waiter. Look, I'll go and get a chair, and then you can really tuck in. There's some stuff in the bin you might like. Potato peelings, cold rice pudding, that sort of thing. Not exactly haute cuisine, but it'll certainly help to fill you up. Ah, Sybil, may I introduce the gentleman who's just opened the self-service department here? It transpires that he has come to check the environmental health. To have a health inspector arrive... SHE SNEEZES ..was going to create wonderful tension and wonderful humour. For most sitcoms, a health inspection would be all you needed to drive the plot. But Cleese and Booth cleverly created a situation where Manuel's pet, a Siberian hamster/rat, was loose in the hotel, providing ingenious new opportunities for bedlam, Fawlty-style. ..to be getting on with. GUNSHOTS God! What was that? Bloody television exploding again! I'll deal with it, you go upstairs. That was a gun! Yes, it did sound like it, didn't it? LAUGHTER Moths. What is going on here? It's agony cos it's like a guided missile, this rat. He's gonna have a health inspector there and a rat there, and they're gonna meet, and it's gonna kill Fawlty again. It's beautiful, the way it's written. The audience are in on the secret, so the constant high-level risk of the rodent being discovered escalates the tension for the viewers. And when a real rat was used in the studio, also for a certain member of the cast. 'I remember during rehearsals...' Do you mind? Que? ..John saying, "Now, when we do the scene with the rat, "it will be a real rat." And I said, "Oh, right. I'm not good..." I was even frightened of my own hamster, to be honest, once it got let out of a cage. John Cleese very kindly said, "I will come in the night before, "we will have a closed studio, "and I will sit opposite the table where you're sitting, "and I will tell you funny stories. "And that will distract you." With the rat in Quentina's handbag and a health inspector only feet away, Basil is desperate to catch the rodent. What ARE you doing? What? He had his hand in my bag. Once again, it's Polly's quick thinking which saves the situation, coming up with a reason to go through the bag. Bomb scare! What? As always, salvation is temporary. Amazing physical comedy, that moment where Fawlty reaches into the woman's handbag and is attacked by the rat. And then it jumps out. LAUGHTER It's just amazing! ..blue, Edam? And as is typical for farce, the two elements, which have been expertly kept apart till now, one health inspector and one rat, are dramatically brought face-to-face - to brilliant comic effect. LAUGHTER W-Would you care for rat, or...? LAUGHTER And there's sort of a perfect ending. We have the environmental health officer, who is in absolute shock, Sybil sort of making a reference to the weather. I'm afraid it's started to rain again. LAUGHTER And Manuel just slowly drags Basil, who is out for the count, just on the floor, across the back of shot. He has a sort of breakdown, and that's the ultimate breakdown, the final breakdown. But Fawlty Towers wasn't Cleese and Booth's first foray into farce. In an exquisite and rarely seen short film made in 1974, they starred together in an adaptation of Anton Chekhov's short story Romance With A Double Bass. When you first start watching it, you just think, "Where is this gonna go?" And the minute you see, you know, that John Cleese goes for a swim, you know something's gonna go wrong. As a treat for Fawlty fans, this hasn't been seen on British TV for more than 30 years and has the striking image of Cleese swimming naked but for a top hat, followed by Booth's character disrobing, before it quickly descends into farce. A man turns up. He steals her clothes, steals his clothes, and the rest of the movie is the two of them naked, Connie and John. 'How are they doing this? This is outrageous!' Booth's character, an aristocrat, is due back at the palace to meet her fiance at her engagement ball, while the naked Cleese, a musician booked to play at the party, tries to smuggle her in inside his double bass case. FROM THE CASE: Why did you leave me without permission? Er, to collect my instrument, dear lady. John Cleese is, again, trying to maintain both some form of surreptitious behaviour and, at the same time, dignity. There's all sorts of elements thrown into it, with this wonderful sort of Cleese and Connie Booth... ..good-natured Englishness about it, somehow. Even though it's based on a Russian short story. It's a joy. There was quite a chill in the air this morning. Yes, there was. Yes. I didn't think that it would turn out quite so warm. It's naked laughter with Chekhov, but what's really interesting about it is that that's the place where the Fawlty Towers troupe kind of came together for the first time. Andrew Sachs has got a small role in it. Smychkov? In an accent most Fawlty Towers fans wouldn't recognise, the Sachs character helps Cleese with his double bass case to smuggle Booth back into the palace. Come on, you'll be late for rehearsal. Yes. Right. One of the things, I think, that also informs great farce is when the audience themselves, they know the secret. The person who is right in the middle of the farce, they are carrying the secret with them, and those around have no knowledge whatsoever. It's the perfect way of doing it. No, don't. That's all right. No, don't bother. Please don't. You'd do the same for us. No, I wouldn't. Course you would! Leave it! I'd never help you. Never! It is the... cutest little film, and I insist everyone watches it. Cleese and Booth were such a comedic tour de force, even their divorce, during the four years it took to write the second series, couldn't knock them off their creative stride. This really speaks to the depth of the relationship between these two people, right? The idea that, yeah, we might not be able to live together, but there's enough respect there, there's enough goodwill, there's enough ability to see each other for what we are, not what we're not, that we can still work together. And I think that's got to be very rare. But on screen, it was business as usual. The breathtakingly witty scripts delivered by the cast with impeccable comic timing. Going to have a flutter, Fawlty? No, no, no, no, no. No, Basil doesn't bet any more, Major. Do you, dear? No, I don't, dear, no. No, that particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me. LAUGHTER And we don't want it opened up again, do we, Basil? No, you don't, dear. No. You can watch an episode and not know whether it's from series one or two, and with such a long gap, that's extraordinary. In the studio records, John Cleese's ability as a live performer is caught on these rare outtakes, as he improvises by pulling funny faces to keep the audience entertained in between takes. Oh, don't be ridiculous, Basil. It was very obvious that John Cleese spent a lot of the time keeping the audience sort of at that fever pitch that he needed them to be for when they were actually doing the filming. And so he's doing a lot of gurning, a lot of silly-face-pulling, and the audience are clearly absolutely loving it. And there's a wonderful moment when Sybil slams a door... DOOR SLAMS Even the rickety set got Cleese's magic comedy touch. John Cleese, the comedy mind instantly working, with the whole psychiatry sort of subtext of that particular episode, tapping the set and adding to that sort of comedic value to it. That's the sign of a true comic genius, where you react to something unexpected and get an even bigger laugh out of it. In the actual take, BBC director Bob Spiers comes up with an elegant solution to the wobbly set issue. Is that so strange? Will you stop hitting me?! Get away from this door, and don't you dare try and come in here tonight! They pan in... ..to John Cleese for a close-up, and then the audience have this fantastic reaction of, "Oh, that's clever, that's absolutely wonderful." But again, you wouldn't know that if you haven't seen the outtake. Another joke viewers at home may not have been aware of came at the expense of the former Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams. Richard Ingrams, brilliant journalist and curmudgeon, professional curmudgeon shall we call him, was quite negative, or shall we say very negative, about Fawlty Towers, and John Cleese in particular. During the frantic-paced action trying to hide the dead body of a guest in one scene, a brief appearance of an unsavoury character was an open goal for Cleese to get even. Oh, sorry! Sorry, coming in like that. Sorry! They burst into a room and there's a hotel guest with an inflatable blow-up doll, and he's called Mr Ingrams. And that was his little revenge on Richard Ingrams, and how delicious it was. He's always got form with that. I mean, a lot of the characters, I think, were based on people who might have crossed John in the past. Welcome back to our unauthorised celebration of Fawlty Towers, a hotel where owners and staff conform to the well-established sitcom rule that each of the main cast should represent a member of a family. We've got Manuel, who is the little boy, the toddler, and then you've got Dad, of course, John Cleese. Since coming here from Spain, leaving my mother... Outside. Que? Outside. Thank you. Sybil is the kind of scary matriarch. Polly is the sensible daughter. And the extended family could be said to stretch to two doddery old resident matriarchs who'd be occasionally seen mithering over Basil. Oh, well, have a lovely weekend! And don't do anything we wouldn't do. Oh, just a little breathing, surely. What's funny is that they regard Fawlty as their son, slightly wayward son. So they'll always clamp onto him just when he's really, really busy. And in the naming of the spinsters, Miss Tibbs, who I'm sure is named after a film called They Call Me Mr Tibbs, a violent Blaxploitation film of that era, and Miss Gatsby, named after The Great Gatsby. Just bizarre. It really reminds us, doesn't it, of a kind of chintzy bygone age in the UK, where, post-war, something you would do if you needed care is you'd go and just become resident in a hotel. I mean, it's unthinkable now that people would do that, it'd be just be too expensive. But back in the day, hotels had long-term residents who were basically using them as care homes. The longest serving resident was the Major, a befuddled ex-military man from a bygone era played expertly by the sprightly Ballard Berkeley. Do you, er, need any help, Major? Don't move! We think of Ballard Berkeley as this kind of crusty old character. He'd been a handsome, romantic leading man in the 1930s. Go and find a photograph of him when he was young, he was rather dashing. Having worked with Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean and Noel Coward, Berkeley's pedigree ensured a composed performance. Even when he is mistakenly doused with a cup of tea. What on Earth do you think you're doing?! I'll look for the missing £10 immediately, Mrs Richards. Where exactly did you find it, Major? In my pocket! The Major is, in a way, Basil's only friend. And the Major represents, yes, this sort of world which Basil wishes Britain was still in. You know, a kind of rather pleasant imperial stupor, where everyone was jolly decent to each other. Booth and Cleese were generous in giving all characters funny lines, and Berkeley gives a masterclass of bonhomie undercut with a savage sense of humour. Couldn't do without her, Major. She's a fine woman, Mrs Fawlty. No, no, I wouldn't say that. No, nor would I. There's a brilliant bit where the Major starts talking to the moose's head cos he can hear Manuel's voice. Absolutely brilliant portrayal of a man who is not just an old fuddy-duddy, but is actually insane. I can speak English! Oh, hello, Major! How are you today? HE MUTTERS I-I-I-I'm fine, thank you. It's a beautiful day today! They're very clever, the characters, cos we feel like we know them. Cleese and Connie have drawn them so clearly that they are a perfect vessel for the plot. When Brian Hall joined the Fawlty family in series two as Chef Terry, he was playing catch-up, and wanted some background on his character. There's some lovely pieces of direction. Terry, the chef, he said to John Cleese, "Can you tell me a bit more about my character?" And he said, "Well, just play him like he was wanted by the police." And if you watch that, he's always a bit twitchy and looking over his shoulder. And that's a brilliant note. Terry, this kitchen is filthy! Filthy Towers, eh? Now, look! Look, all kitchens are filthy, Mr Fawlty. In fact, the better the kitchen, the filthier it is. You can see how he might have run away from some crime in London and be hiding out in Torquay. As well as the regulars, the Fawlty Towers guest book contained an illustrious list of famous names. You've got people like Ken Campbell, who's fantastic in it. It's almost like real life. He's goading John Cleese, he's saying, "I'm from the world of left-wing improvised theatre, "and I'm gonna take the piss out of John Cleese for half an hour." We're thinking of having this room done up, as a matter of fact. Really? A sort of Captain's cabin, a couple of charts on the wall, few ropes, wheel in the corner, that sort of thing. Yeah, give it a bit of class (!) You had Una Stubbs go through it, you had Bernard Cribbins, you had Geoffrey Palmer. Geoffrey Palmer as the doctor in The Kipper And The Corpse, wonderful, hound dog, sure hand sitcom actor that you know exactly what sort of performance he's going to give, he gives it impeccably every time. I'm sitting here. It's not lunch till 12... I'm still having breakfast! It's finished. All gone. Breakfast, kaput. I'm having sausages. It's not allowed. Put that back. Look, I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor and I want my sausages. I tell you it's finished. Bye-bye. Please, bye-bye. Everyone loves Bernard Cribbins. It's a beautiful thing when you watch someone like that playing a part that you don't think of as a Bernard Cribbins part. Because Bernard Cribbins wasn't normally that kind of, you know, "What an annoying man!" This afternoon, I have to visit the town for sundry purposes which would be of no interest of you, I'm quite sure, but nevertheless, I shall require your aid in getting for me some sort of transport, some hired vehicle that is to get me to my first port of call. You all right? Oh, yes. Yes, I find the air here most invigorating. I see. Well, did I gather from your first announcement that you want a taxi? In a nutshell. Case, more like. He dominates everything, so he comes in and, you know, he's easily as good as Cleese. One of the most memorable guest spots was the indomitable Joan Sanderson as hard-of-hearing battle-axe Mrs Richards. You call that a bath? It's not big enough to drown a mouse. It's disgraceful. I wish you were a mouse. Joan Sanderson had that voice that pierced anything. It was almost like you were dealing with your headmistress all the time. She always played these really sort of hatchet-faced, you know, moaners. When I pay for a view, I expect something more interesting than that. That is Torquay, madam. Well, it's not good enough. Well, may I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? The Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically... Don't be silly. I expect to be able to see the sea. You CAN see the sea. It's over there, between the land and the sky. She just really carries that show. And, of course, plays off him brilliantly. Despite its brilliance, by 21st century standards, some of the portrayals of foreign characters can be seen as stereotypical, outdated, and wouldn't pass muster today. There is a slight shadow that has to be discussed whenever you talk about Fawlty Towers, and to be fair, not just Fawlty Towers, lots of sitcoms in the '70s, and that's sort of the issue of racism. If you look at it in a really simple way, I think it's true that there are a lot of victims. So, obviously, Manuel, who's Spanish. And then the Irish builder. Builder O'Reilly was subject to a remarkably damning diatribe from Sybil, redolent of Irish jokes typical at the time. He's shoddy, he doesn't care, he's a liar, he's incompetent, he's lazy. He's nothing but a half-witted, thick Irish joke! Oh, hello, O'Reilly! Oh, funny, we were just talking about you, and then we got onto another Irish builder we used to know. Oh, God, he was AWFUL! O'Reilly is someone who's walked into this absolute hornet's nest without a clue about what's happening here. And there's a barbed comment about the sexuality of Greeks after Chef Kurt tries to kiss Manuel. I know, I should never have hired a Frenchman. He's Greek, Mr Fawlty. Greek?! Of course! That's even worse, they invented it. I can't think of many gay characters that were in 1970s sitcoms, and actually, even though he's got drunk because he's miserable because Manuel doesn't love him, he's not being laughed at because he's gay. He is a real gay man, he's not a caricature of a gay man, and that's quite an advance. The most uncomfortable one is where he seems to not trust the doctor because the doctor is Black. He's come out, "Argh! It's a Black guy!" Mr Fawlty. Yes, sir. Dr Finn. Ah! Oh, how do you do, Doctor? Once he knew what he was doing, there was no resistance, was there? That would have been really obvious. "I don't want you putting your Black hands on my wife." It's obvious, it's horrible, it's nasty, it's pernicious, it's all of those things. The shock of it is real. It's one of those things where you go, you're laughing at the British person being an idiot, because he is being rude to the people from outside of the country. So it's a very fine line to walk. Undoubtedly, the most infamous incidents of dodgy race relations occurs when a party of Germans descends upon Torquay. It's only 30 years after the war this episode was made. For that generation, the war looms large. To play with that and to be that outrageous about it is really edgy. Still concussed after a fire extinguisher exploded in his face, Basil is determined not to say the wrong thing. Oh, we weren't expecting you. Oh, weren't you? They're Germans, don't mention the war. I see. It's an early example of the awkward humour that Ricky Gervais does. The whole "don't mention the war" thing, it's just a horrible bomb waiting to go off. Now, would you like to eat first, would you like a drink before the war...ning that trespassers will be tied up with piano wire... Sorry! Sorry! It's the fact that he doesn't just realise his error fairly quickly, he compounds it and goes on and on about it, and it gets worse and worse. Is there something wrong? Would you stop talking about the war? Me? You started it! We did not start it! Yes, you did, you invaded Poland. It is dangerous territory, but at the time, it was brilliantly funny, and it's because, actually, all credit due to the actors playing the Germans. You watch it and you think, "That is going to end in something completely grotesque." So, and, yeah, there it is, it ends in something completely grotesque. Who's this, then? HE SHOUTS I'll do the funny walk. HE SHOUTS Stop it! What? Stop it! I'm trying to cheer her up, you stupid Kraut! Him goose-stepping, alongside Del Boy falling through the bar, is probably one of the most iconic elements of physical humour in British sitcoms. The full goose-stepping, silly walks bit, with a bandage on the head, he's clearly gone... It's beautifully done. He created this absolute physical wreck of a human being, with this lanky, all arms, all legs person who got everything wrong, and that's what you're laughing at. To hammer home the fact Fawlty should be the butt of the joke and not the Germans, a typically chaotic climax gives them the last word. However did they win? Yeah, so that is a question that I've asked myself many a time. And I think that the answer is, by not worrying about it too much. We're not laughing with him at the Germans, we're laughing at his stupidity as to how he behaves to the Germans. And that's why it's OK. There are only two series of Fawlty Towers, which closed its doors after just 12 episodes. It's like Fleetwood Mac writing Rumours, they could maybe do one album that's almost as good, they can never do another one. And he knew he'd done it. That's it, that's Cleese. Audiences at home clamoured for more, and repeats would get over 13 million viewers. While abroad, its reputation was growing, and by 1984, it was one of the BBC's most sold programmes worldwide. It was a product that the BBC knew was a commercial winner, really. With each episode so packed full of sublime comedy writing, it was no surprise other regions tried to adapt their own versions for domestic audiences - even the Germans had a go. Wir sind nicht in deiner Heimat. Neues Brot. Wirf das weg. Ha? Wirf das wag. That's TV start to finish. Some German production company tried to cash in on Fawlty Towers, come up with essentially a carbon copy, but without any of the nuance, without any of the timing, without any of the ability. The Americans tried and failed three times to remake this classic British comedy. The American versions, they're all fairly short-lived and fairly big flops. And you can kind of see why. Snavely saw Blazing Saddles star Harvey Korman playing alongside Golden Girl-to-be Betty White, snidely snapping at guests like Basil, but without the ironic wit of the original. You'll be taken care of, just wait your turn! Snavely is the one that is most like Fawlty Towers, it's even got the same set. It's pretty much almost identical, except that because it's Harvey Korman, there's a slightly weird quality to the character. In the British version, Prunella Scales plays Sybil with that real acerbic kind of darkness, and Basil needs that. Because then you believe he's unhappy. Do you understand?! Yes! Good. Whereas, in the other version, it was Harvey's character who was the kind of more... He wasn't as horrible, and she wasn't as horrible to him, so it just sort of missed a bit for me, it just didn't quite work. Oh, Mr Bishop, we missed you. Did you have a pleasant phone call? Your phone receiver was greasy, I had to wipe it off. Henry! He's still a guest. The Americans then remade Fawlty Towers again - with another Golden Girl, Bea Arthur. But producers of Amanda's made the inextricable decision to cut the character of Basil Fawlty altogether, leaving Arthur to deliver a wisecracking performance with little support. Distinguished guests, 102. Huh? You'll have to excuse him, he's from Toronto. She's quite good on the one-liners, but there's rather too many of them. Every time someone says something, she says something under her breath. Have a wonderful day, and please, please, if there is anything that you should want... you can take a flying leap. What?! I said, "Have a wonderful sleep." It gets a bit wearing after a while. And in 1999, John Larroquette admirably wisecracked through the scripts, but the punches lacked the hard-hitting impact and manic chaos of the originals. Here's some things for the lost and found. Really? What did the little fun-seekers leave behind? Well, this hat was in 208. Hideous. I found this book in the bar. Danielle Steel. This is not a book, might as well read the hat. The rhythm of it still feels like a very traditional sitcom. The agony and the waiting to see everything implode, the ultimate anarchy, is something which never got replicated. I think the reason that this show didn't kind of work, even though they tried two or three times to reboot it in the States, was because I think you have to have an understanding of the British class system to really get the joke. And it doesn't exist in the States the way that it exists over here. This is social commentary on a whole people, and if you don't understand that, it's kind of you're missing the biggest part of the joke. But are we soon to be given a US remake with the original British Fawlty back behind the check-in desk? It's a testament to how loved in the States is Fawlty Towers, that one small announcement about a possible remake just caused this huge stir. John Cleese and his daughter Camilla are in talks in America with Rob Reiner's company. So, the premise, Basil Fawlty finds out he's got a long-lost daughter, played by Camilla Cleese, and they open up an exquisite boutique hotel. Ooh, a reboot of Fawlty Towers. Oh, that's dangerous. But then, you do have John Cleese doing it, so you never know. I think John Cleese probably needs the money. And so I think it's as simple as that. Well, I thought... Oh, come on, John. You're 83! Sit down, you know. Play golf. Regardless of what happens, the original Fawlty Towers has given us one of the greatest sitcom character creations in the hands of a supremely gifted physical comedy performer. You got a Mrs Richards staying here? Oh... Nobody would be as funny as him playing that character. He brings so much extra of just, physically, who he is. It's one of those rare occasions, as it turns out, where every single person is at the top of their game. Every cog is working in concert to make it the sort of sublime show that it is. Stupidissimo! You continental cretin! I'm sorry, I'll get you another one. Un altro! Pronto! Pronto! Pronto! It's flawless. It's absolutely flawless. When you watch every episode, even now, 50 years later, there isn't a single moment where you think, "Oh, they could have done that one better." And John Cleese's physical commitment to comedy hasn't grown old either. What do you mean, "out"? He's drunk! Drunk? Drunk, soused, potted, inebriated! Got it?! I don't believe it. Neither do I. Perhaps it's a dream. No, it's not a dream, we're stuck with it. Right! It inspired so many people to want to be as good and have something that millions of people all over the world will know. For a comedy to last nearly 50 years and still pick up new audiences, that shows how special it was. It's still extreme, it's very British, it's very funny. It'll probably be popular until the end of time. To keep that kind of intensity and make it funny, that was quite an achievement.
