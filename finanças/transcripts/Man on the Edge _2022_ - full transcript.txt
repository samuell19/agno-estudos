My condolences to all colleagues Notify me When it's done Okay. Stop smoking. It's not popular anymore. Hey, you taught me that in the police academy. Now you have quit and talk nonsense here. Quit it. It's good to talk to people with fresh breath. Okay. After we dismantle San Luen Sing I'll quit smoking Smoke less. All stand at attention. Salute! Tim Do you know what the consequences are? What's the problem? He's a cop. I'm a gangster. He should have seen it coming. Even if Cheong didn't say anything. He would have died sooner or later What's the problem Tim Kowtow to the ancestors What's up boss? I told you to kowtow I'll do what the boss tells me to do. I'll do what the boss tells me to do. I'll do what the boss tells me to do. I'll do what the boss tells me to do. I'll do what the boss tells me to do. I'll do what the boss tells me to do. - I'll do what the boss tells me to do. - Tim. I'll do what the boss tells me to do. Tim! I'll do what the boss tells me to do. That's enough. Cheong Tim was wrong. If there's any trouble after this. I can help. You stay out of it. Let him take care of his own problems. No, you should give him a chance. You don't blame Lok. The first time he joined We got into trouble You said the police know your location Is there a problem with your men? Don't talk nonsense I still suspect you I'm always afraid the boss will get you involved in drug trafficking - You must be the one who leaked the news. - What did you say asshole Stop it Bastard We're all brothers don't fight. Stop it What do you want It's okay. Get up. - Thank you, Cheong. - Get out first. Get out! Go, go, go. I know the British looked for you. Don't fall for it. You grew up here. Don't forget who you are. What blood you bleed. Thank you, boss. You are my husband's best friend He said If one day he is no longer here I should give this to you When I left the Special Branch It was because someone didn't want me to stay there Because of your relationship with Chung Leun I didn't want you to know too much There are a lot of things in there that they don't want others to see You should be careful Sometimes it's really strange I've been your brother for so long I do not know what you are thinking What do you want What do I want You don't know - Not this one. - Not this. It's from Helen. You always took care of me when I was little. I was sure it must be right to follow Cheong. Now you're stepping down. What should I do When I was young I was always being hunted My heart never beat above 100 But now Just singing and playing the guitar My heartbeat can be over one hundred and four at any time The jungle is getting old I just hope the society can be safe and sound She's about to give birth Not so fast - Boy or girl - Preferably girl Girl is good The six gods are all together The six paths are in harmony All things are auspicious With no evil spirits Lam's Yiu Cheong Has been in the position of the leader for 6 years He respects our ancestors' teachings And cuts through the thorns The prosperity of San Luen Sing has been brought about All because of its strength He considers that he has lived up to the expectation of his parents Of the world Of the brothers Today, I will seal my sword and step down I will wash my hands in a golden basin And do not care about the jungle anymore I'm setting up a banquet and a ritual As a tribute to our brothers The previous leaders were all elected by the elders Only the one who can convince others and have the ability is qualified to sit in this position The same rules apply On the seventh day of next month The elders Will elect a new boss Does Syun Pau fit? You made me the boss back then. No one thought I'd make it. I used Eight Trigram to tell the fortune It's Ming Yi. Dark times... everything fails Will be punished instead You mean If Syun Pau is to be the boss The society will fall I used the Chuji method to tell the fortune of Syun Pau's The fortune of Syun Pau is actually not bad Sha Po Lang enters Self Palace Three palaces together with the opposite palace to from the four proper direction Unfortunately, he is in the 10-year period He sees no wealth and rcareer but threating stars come to his destiny Even in this decade The Sibling Palace helps his wealth and right TheWealth and Career palaces exchange It will also be difficult for him to escape athe destiny Will there be another better choice It seems that after I retire I'll have to learn Zi Wei Dou Shu from you Cheers! Cheers! What are you doing? Why aren't you guys drinking? Drink up! Good bro I knew you'd be on my side Anyway... If I successfully take the leading seat As long as I am here You will definitely have one share One share So little You're so greedy When you first joined the society I didn't like you. But you're humane I almost fell off the boat. You pulled me up. I remember that. So I count you in I should not have pulled you up in the first place I count you in You son of a bitch! Cheers! Come on, buddy. Why wasn't I invited? Come on, cheers! - Take care of Uncle Chien - Syun Pau come over here. Cheers, bros Everyone is very supportive today I know, I know. Lok Our boss and Tim had a falling out. Just argued a bit You won. The money. Thank you, Lok Take care of your boss. Don't let him drink so much Hmmm Who are you No way You're drunk so soon You're old. You're a lot younger than me. Let's go. Go on Wait a minute. You know what? Cheong sold some properties to cash out He said If it's all calm and quiet three months After I take over the society He will give you a big gift Don't be ridiculous Go in. I rarely talk to Cheong But he's definitely a good boss Get in! Go, go, go. Let's go! You bastard, come out and fight with me alone Syun Pau Hold on! - What's wrong? - Call an ambulance. Syun Pau Syun Pau Hold on Boss Boss excuse me，please. Boss Boss Syun Pau, you can't die. Your child is not yet born His breathing and pulse are weak. Blood oxygen unstable How is he, Cheong? Inform his family My sister-in-law is pregnant. What should I tell her? I'll tell her. Tim, how's Syun Pau? He was killed. Did you get someone to do it? I'm warning you, don't talk nonsense. He's my best friend that went through fire and water. I wouldn't do such a despicable thing. Everyone knows that you don't like him. You want to compete with him for the boss position I compete for the position with my strength I will not do what your generation did You killed my boss I won't let you go any way Don't talk nonsense What Who are you What are you doing? Chan Sir a lot of noise up there. Do you want to go up and take a look? Over a hundred people there, why bother to go up there If something happens, doctor works better than the police. Let them have fun for a while None of your business. What do you want to do What are you doing That's enough Stop it Get back Stop it Stop it Stop it What are you doing What do you want Lok You'll be in charge of all Syun Psu's places. No way, boss, you really give them to him? To you then Sure I hope you really do good for the society. Hey! You killed Syun Pau Each district of San Luen Sing plus the overseas ones There must be 50,000 to 60,000 people. If we can mobilize half of them Not to mention Hong Kong, In the entire Southeast Asian drug market We can make a lot of money Lam Yiu Cheong is old I made the rules very clear to you at the beginning I'll be the middleman You help me get to the top You don't have a say in anything at San Luen Sing I'm the one to decide who dies. You'd better make it clear You join this circle because I think highly of you It's not because you are the only one My business can't wait for you to get enough vote. If You are in charge before the next shipment. Continue to be a cockroach in your society Bastard! If you had told me earlier, you wouldn't have to suffer so much. Syun Pau Have a good trip Boss Except for asking me to fight for the position of the boss Is there no other way? Lok From now on, I won't force you to do anything But this time... I need you to do your best to fight for it Do something for the society You don't want Tim to be the boss You must have your reasons. But I don't think It's not that simple. If Tim becomes the boss. The whole society will be ruined. Even you are so worried. Who's behind it? The more you know. The deeper you'll fall. I'm giving it to you. It's an antique. Cherish it. You give it to me and you're getting a new one. No I'm going to South Africa afterwards. I'm not going to take it with me, so I give it to you. That's right. What about the store? I can sell it. Or rent it to someone else. Maybe I'll go to England afterwards. I don't know. But I've never been to South Africa. I'm going to give myself a long vacation. I remember you said you'd like to get out and about. What do you think of South Africa? I... I... I'm... Just… Hello, Mr. Lok Tell me It's like this I'd like to know What do you plan After you became the boss of San Luen Sing It must be me? Tim is so hot-headed. So arrogant I don't think the uncles will choose him Then you should also join the society Then more people will elect me We are very democratic Better than the British We don't even have a choice to appoint a governor Don't move! Don't move! Sit still. Hand over the mastermind who killed Superintendent Law. It's easy to find a witness to accuse you. And the murder of Syun Pau will be on you as well Murder. You won't get away with it for 20 years. Accuse me? Do you think I'm a newbie But you'd better find out first Whether you are with the good or with the bad For so many years You've said so much in front of Lord Guan Aren't you afraid of retribution? What did you say? He's asking you Why people want to be with the bad instead of the good? See for yourself How do you explain this undercover file? What is it? You know better than me. After Syun Pau found out about you. You killed him. I can say you contracted the murder. The evidence is all here It's useless to say anything. They colluded What do you want Let's go Go go Go Don't let them get away Don't let them get away This way Go! Come on, get down After him Quickly Hurry up Come out Come out Don't run Go - Let's get this straight - Nothing to do with you Undercover Tim Lok What do you have on the society Give it to me and I'll intercede for you No need to talk so much Sell us out, right I'll slit your throat. - No! - Police! Get down Hands in the air Get down Get out of the way Get out of the way Get down Get down You hear me Are you here to arrest or save anyone? With this few men? How dare you come into the walled city to rescue people? You must have broken your head! Come down! See if my head is broken - I think you've broken your head. - Shut up! What do you want? What are you doing? Nobody move! Get back Get back Get back Get back Nobody move Get back, you hear me? Get back Ching Sir What do you want? Huh? Put it down! Ching Sir Just misunderstanding My family business Can you let me handle it myself? Family issue If I had come a little later It will become a death issue If you make a big deal out of it. Not good for everyone If I hadn't turned a blind eye Do you think your people can hide until now? You've been in so much trouble lately. I don't think you have time for my people. In a way. My people are now your talisman Write down the IDs of everyone at the scene for me If there are wanted criminals, arrest them If not, close the team Yes, sir. ID card Don't touch me I'll take it myself Lok has been with me for more than 10 years. He knows all your things If he were an undercover agent He would have reported you Today We'd be meeting in prison With just these few pieces of paper Cheong, I don't mean to contradict you. But that police seal doesn't add up Is it difficult for them to forge the files For their personal gains? You tell me How many cops have you bribed to keep your outside gambling license Go ahead Where did you get the information No, boss. You don't want to get your hands dirty no problem. I'll do it. How many times have I told you I told you not to go with the gringos You just don't listen It's not that I don't want to listen. I just don't understand Why. Is it wrong for me to climb up the ladder Sooner or later, I can turn the society into The largest legalized society in Hong Kong What's wrong with me I don't have to listen to others I can make my own decisions Don't touch it again I want everyone to live in peace It's not that simple. Just like before, you've been retreating again and again. Enough. I don't want to be a nobody for the rest of my life. Boss I'm sorry boss It's my fault I didn't listen to you I was an asshole I'm the one who ruined the society What's wrong with you guys Vote for what Nonsense From now on Whoever is tough enough Will be the boss that's it Tim Don't worry I think Cheong will trust you. Stop Get out of the car What are you doing What's wrong with you What are you looking for? Besides Ching Sir Who else do you work for? I work for all the police forces in Hong Kong. I won't work for you gangsters. Do you know you'll get yourself and me killed like this? You think you haven't hurt enough Who do you think you are Stop it Stop it Did take the blame for Cheong or not? I was in jail for three years. Not to take the blame for anyone. But because I couldn't stop the tragedy from happening. I'm responsible for it. You're really an undercover agent? It doesn't matter if I am or not. If your boss trusts you. You tell him It's useless to keep an eye on San Luen Sing If you want to know more Ask him to come out and talk in person Hey If the society finds any undercover in the future. You stand out or me It's so exciting I'm scared Kick me out of the society Then I'll give him back everything I have I'll pay him back everything I owe him Why are you telling me this I've always supported you I've always been on your sid I have no intention to stop you I can give you all the people you need But... The boss and the uncles You touch none of them Leave some dignity to them Not mentioning Lok We are sworn brothers. You know it well But I warn you. If this endangers the club. I won't give you a face. Lam Yiu Cheong supports Lok. And will definitely mobilize the rest of San Luen Sing to go against you. You leave them a way out You are leaving yourself a dead end You foreigners like to talk in a roundabout way Can't you be more direct? Societies have their own rules. I know what to do. The time these people drink a glass of champagne Determines the development of Hong Kong in the next ten years The fate of millions of people. You're nothing in their eyes Without me, you'd never have made it. This guy is the one behind everything. Chief Superintendent Richard of the Special Branch He's also backing Tin to replace Lam Yiu Cheong The purpose is to control the San Luen Sing And use it to help them do all kinds of illegal crimes Drug trafficking is just one of them. Such large-scale drug business It is sure he is not the only one to rely on Richard is the same as Lam YiuCheong He's just a link in the chain of interests To maintain it The power behind it Has probably arranged their people in the judiciary Banks Customs International finance and other fields The information you have now Provides only the direction of the investigation Not to mention that the person you're accusing Is a senior officer of the police force You can't charge him with just saying he's a dirty cop. Last time, Tim forged my undercover file. Although the content was fake But the official stamp on it is real. This is proof enough The person who helped Tim behind the scene must be a mole in the police force. Go! Hurry up! Kill me if you can. I won't let you go. It's just not working out. Tim. You're a talented man. If I were not to choose you, it would be a pity for me. Yeah, we all support you. Good These guys... can enjoy their late years Put them down. Stir them up. Put me down! Hey, let go! Are you out of your mind? Is it not enough to kill Lok. And now even the uncles What did you promise me? I'm just one step away. Don't get in my way. Who's in your way? Cheong has given you all the good things What else do you want? Can't you just be like the old days? What did he give me? He won't give me What I want I want to be the boss If he doesn't give it to me, I'll take it myself. Now that you've beaten these uncles. No one in the society will obey you And the whole society will fight against you Against me? Whoever wants to fight against me can stay Those who don't want to fight can go home You don't deserve to be the boss if you betray your brothers Don't mess around. What? Stop Okay. I'm fine. I don't want to lose a brother. Will you go home? I'll hit you first Do it Police Don't move. Don't move. Get down. Fai Wang We have evidence to prove You're the mastermind of a residential arson and attempted murder. This is a warrant for your arrest. You are now officially under arrest. You're a traitor. Listen to me. You conspired with the police to set me up. Fai Wang Stop! Stop right there! The police arrested the suspect Of the residential arson a few days ago During the operation The leader of the case, Fai Wang, resisted the arrest was killed by the police on the spot The case is still under investigation The first day you joined the Society I made it very clear to you In our world If you betray your brothers You do not abide by your duty There is no way to survive It seems that you still don't understand today From now on You're no longer a member of San Luen Sing. Cheong No matter how hard you work, you can't change the reality More power only comes with higher status Otherwise you cannot change Reality and ideal are two worlds It is difficult to balance One day You will find what I said is right Dead? You shouldn't be a cop. You should be an actor. Tim. You stop now. I'll pretend nothing has happened. You're still helping him. From the first day he came back. San Luen Sing has never been good. Don't you think there's something wrong? Do you want to kill all your brothers to satisfy you? Do you want to kill me too? He was only in jail for a few years. What about me? In the past few years, San Luen Sing has made so much money. Who worked hard to earn it back? It's me... You don't want to get your hands dirty Who will do it? It's me Is there credit to run roughshod over Have you ever thought of Syun Pau and Fai Wang Have you ever thought of us as brothers I have chosen this path I won't care so much You forced me Come on. Tim. That's enough, Tim. Don't think that if you're merciful. The world will repay you. Is this evidence reliable? Hey! Let's go. Mr. Richard We are the Independent Commission Against Corruption We now suspect you of Misconduct in public office and the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance Please come with us to assist in the investigation Sure I'll stay with you for two hours This way, please. Hello. I know you. You know me. Tell Lok for me I admire him the most This is the trading record For one day of the investment company The amount of money is over 4 million pounds How can you do it alone? Who's behind this? Time's up. Sir. Let him go. Hello Understood ICAC, let him go. Cheong wants to see you. And you. Cheong. My four bros. You're the only one left. I've made a deal with the British After this last shipment San Luen Sing will No longer have anything to do with them We cut off their money. They won't let you off the hook Go to Thailand and stay low for a while When things are over I'll pick you up again After you go to Thailand Play the guitar to relieve the boredom if you feel bored Boss You never seem to ask me After I graduated, what I did In the years when I was out It doesn't matter what you did In the end, it's just a choice Sometimes I feel like I'm neither a bad gut nor a good guy But I always remember At the beginning, for the sake of justice I chose to be a cop Don't... there is nothing to do with Ka Kui Give him a way to live This is your final choice Come on Syun Pau died I knew he was a cop I chose to shoot Tim that time. I chose you. But I couldn't change you. For more than 10 years I've been lying to myself At least I had a good brother When I was in jail I realized one thing This group of people in our society Thinking they have no way out They become an accomplice and force people to move Demolishing other people's homes In fact, they are forcing themselves Demolishing their own home I took the blame for you Because I know you are also a victim I support you I know you don't want to be an accomplice of the British anymore Don't tell me that Boss Even if Tim didn't collude with the British. They would still find a way to control San Luen Sing Or even the entire societies in Hong Kong. In this world The truth is not like this You don't know anything. They just want to turn the triads Into terrorists in their hands I just don't want my brothers to die again That's why I put my life on the line to protect you.
