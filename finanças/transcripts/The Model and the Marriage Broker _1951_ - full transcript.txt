MODEL AND THE WEDDING Only? Shy? Disappointed? Tired of being single? See Mae Swasey. Guaranteed success. It's open, come in. Going down! Forgive. Now, let me talk. If you are asked your age, say you are 33 years old. If they tell you about money, pick up a magazine and go to the bathroom. Why do they knock? I already asked them to come in! It looked like it wasn't for us. I'm Mrs. Thomas Gingras. This is my sister-in-law, Hazel. Mrs. Kratzer recommended us to you. Do you remember Mrs. Kratzer? Do I remember Mrs. Kratzer? For it was I who arranged for Mrs Kratzer's wedding. Sit here, please. I'll be back in a minute. I liked it so much ... Listen, you called me ... Make yourself at home, girls. She called me and said, "No matter who, less that fat and dizzy Swede ". What happened? She said I liked it ... He wants me to return the money to you. I followed all your advice. Did you take her out to dinner? Of course. - Where? - At Nedick. Nedick? If they only give orange juice. They also make sausages. He told me to look for someone economic but maybe it went too far, no? Afterwards, we had a pleasant time. Did you go to the music hall? We were taking a walk. Did you walk in this heat? Where? From 14th street to the third avenue. Then, on 23rd Street and then 24. I like to count the buildings. And then they came back? On the way back, I counted them in Swedish. It is supposed that the lady should be cut to him. Kissed her? No, ma'am. Listen, I explained it to you. Before your house, pick up your key and open the door for him. When I return the key to you, lean over and kiss her sweetly. What happened? The key fell to the floor. I quit! I can never find you a bride. Any man... One moment, one moment. Let's see. What was this girl's name ? Delia something ... She loved taking walks ... I must have classified her in C as a walker. Here it is. Delia Seaton. Mr. Johannson, this girl will fit you like a glove. Partly 1m 70, loves nature and walks, ornithology, and has little talk. I can already hear the church bells ringing . Come to my house on Sunday for coffee. And put on a sports outfit. Can I see a picture of you? Sure, why not? Eh ... wait. After she fixed the dentures. Mr. Johannson, I'll see you at my house on Sunday. Good Morning. So, did you delete it from the list? He says he already hears the church bells. It seems absurd that we are here ... but we passed through the neighborhood, and Mrs Kratzer has told us so much about you. It's to die for laughing! Sit down. Hazel ... and the family name? Gingras, G-I-N-G-R-A-S. It is my husband's sister. We love her very much, of course, and we are delighted to live with her. Look, until last year, she took care of Tom's dad. She's the best daughter there is. He never took a party or looked at men. An authentic record! She was always shy with men. It's rubbing and looks away so as not to give them wings. Age? 33 years. He did them in September. How old are you next year? What you mean? 34, of course! Listen, if I'm going to be your agent, nobody will see these files. What do I put then? I've never seen anyone insult us so much in my life. Let's go, I don't even know why we came ... to this place. Come on, say it. Forty. That's what I had put. There is no reason to say it in a whisper. Is it any dishonor to be 40 years old? A king abdicated for a girl who was no longer a child. Maybe not a king, but many men would be proud to have her as a wife. How much money do you have? Second door on the left. $ 4000, from your late father 's insurance . In the case of women of this age, they want to know if they have money in the bank. Are these your photos? These are Christmas. It would be better if you had 5000 dollars ... I deal fact! Mrs Kratzer commented on them something ... Of... Agency expenses? When I get someone with the profile, then we'll talk about my commission. Surely you have more than one customer, but do it the best you can with it, to see if we can get rid of it. Didn't you say you liked living with her? I think of the best for her. You are so alone! It's even getting used to it ... Soon it will look like you! You can get a little used to poverty, or blindness, but never to loneliness! I will try to see if I can find the possible candidate for this Sunday. I told him that I have never been with any man, but I was with one, very kind. We were going to get married, but his mother suffered an attack at the last moment. He wanted us to get married! That's the truth! Come on, take it easy. Enter, Doberman. It seems to be busy. I'll come back later. No, wait a minute. I have to tell you. We will do the following. Go and fill it out at home. Tell me everything your heart feels. I wish it was all over ... Accordingly. Mail me and come to my house on Sunday at noon. And don't put on that hat anymore. Is it the June announcement? So, how's business going? It’s not about that, is it? Do you know what would fund my retirement? A Singles Regiment who had a sense of humor. we had some complaints about these glasses. It is reinforced plastic. Hello, Mr Wixted. Ah, hello. Don't hurry, I have time. Look again. These look great on you ... I shouldn't take them away. With these glasses I feel very charming. Given my craft, it is the most beautiful compliment you can give me. - How much do I owe? - Nothing. it was a pleasure. Come back when you want. I will do that, thank you. My head hurt again, you know? It must be my eyes. Come on, you don't seem to have any migraines. There's another candidate, isn't there? Listen, it's for real that it's the woman you've been looking for. It has good type, sweet and discreet. turned 33 in September. It may be a little shy, but it also has character. Furthermore, Mr Wixted, has 5000 dollars in the bank. Mrs. Swasey, I regret signing this contract. I changed my mind. I prefer not to get married and remain free. There is no man who does not want to be married! I know you well. He is no longer a child. One of these days, you'll need someone to support you. But I do well. Of course, there are still some years left and some adventure to live. But in a little while, you will sit in the park watching the wind lift the girls' skirts. In one day, all of this won't even interest you. I hope I killed myself earlier. For now, you need a woman. Look: fat because of bad eating, with double chin ... Thank me that you dug up a spinster. Unearthed? Calm down, I wasn't dead. It's not. It's a good piece! It is not that it is the most exciting, but it is serious. Well well... Must see!

Come to my house on Sunday at noon, but first go to the hairdresser. I know the way, let's avoid the Panama Canal! Mrs. Kuschner! Don't turn around that it's that Swasey woman. She introduced us, didn't she? It's a love match. You'll never see a dime from us. Hurry up! Tell me, honey, is Mr. Hornbeck here? My bones need you to look after them. It's in the radiology room. He knows me! Mr. Hornbeck! Hello, Mrs. Swasey. The pains came back. I have terrible pain in my back. We'll solve it. Find Mrs. Swasey's file. I'm coming to see. - Do not say anything? - What? So you don't know it? Wait a moment. Thanks to you, my life has changed. What are you talking about? Ina Kuschner? It's going to be called Ina Hornbeck. Since Friday at eleven. - Who would think! If I arrived 10 minutes ago, I could see you. I had no idea. I can take charge of Mrs. Swasey. A patient wants to know what happens to his kidney. But, didn't the Kuschners invite you to the ceremony? To me? Because? It was at your house where I met Ina. In my house? When? It will be a month. It was a Sunday. Oh yes, the day your treatment burned my back. It wasn't even red ... And that lovely Ina brought me flowers! I had forgotten. You set up a date with Ina, didn't you? Clear. He invited me to the next day. Tome. On Friday at eleven. I want to see you in the front row. This way, Mrs. Swasey. "Mr and Mrs Howard Davis Kushner are pleased to invite you ..."

Don't forget about Friday! I will warn the Kuschners that it will come. No, no, leave it. I will tell you myself. Aren't you ready yet, Mrs. Swasey? No, honey, I'm going to skip today's session. I'm better now. Hey, but it's not my purse! Oh, very well! Open it! I took the wrong bag. "Kitty, honey, I know I 'm a mess." "I should have talked about Louise from the beginning, but my love for you prevented me from doing it ". "I know it's not one of those go out with married people, but we need each other ". No but... "We have to find a solution, dear, I have to see you". "I beg you, I need you. Doug." Wait for Mrs. Swasey? Is not here? I picked up your bag by mistake. This must be with mine. It should arrive soon. Like that "should", here I am! It's my purse you're using. I left yours at the desk. Didn't you notice anything when you opened it? What a fool I am! My arms were tired. I must sign these papers. Can I call? Of course. Are you there. Sign what? Those documents. Extension 541. Can I speak to Doris? Yes I hope. Leave it on the table. Certainly, Mrs. Swasey ... A good customer has just introduced himself. Later. Mr. Perry and his three daughters. It's not bad. A little silly, but beautiful. There are two others. Later. No, he says he's the Richmond cider mogul . Sou Kitty Bennett. the parade started? Let me talk to Doris. Oh, hello Doris, did anyone ask for me? Okay, that's right. What dress? Or transponded? Get my combination from the dressmaker on the corner. Thank you, I will do it quickly. Thank you, Mrs. Swasey. What is transposed? It is a type of sewing. I'm a model in Russeks. Don't tell me ... I never entered such a place. Come. We have things that interest you and your size. I would be fine, with one of those cross-stitches ... Why not? I'm a business woman. For right. What does this mean? The warning? No. "Contacts and contracts". I represent many people, you know? I take care and manage your affairs. I give advice. Got it. Thank you for returning the bag! See you later. One moment, this dress is absolutely wonderful. Listen, dear. I have experience, you know? Leave him. Forgiveness? I know these men who say to women: "You know I'm a mess." And do you know what they are? Fumbled. So you read my letter. I couldn't resist. Isn't it the same with you? No, I don't read other people's letters. He just looked for his address. But after the first few words, it should be taken care of, right? Okay, it wasn't my business ... It wouldn't be my business either if I was hit by a truck, but ... Leave him! Didn't use my phone? Also use my trash can. Shoot your card. Do you find me unable to make my own decisions? I know what I'm talking about. I'm older than you. When someone wants to excuse their bad manners, always talk about age ... Sorry, I'm going to be late for work. Excuse me too. Hello, are you Mr. Perry? How are you? Well, must these be some of your beautiful daughters? Sit down. Sit down. Well, as the Bible says: "Blessed is the man with a complete arsenal". Lorraine Hotel. Tudor Hall. Eleven o'clock. Kuschner link. How did you get in? I'll take care of that. Good morning, Mrs. Kuschner. Everything is ready... What are you doing here? I tried to contact you, anyway. I've been very busy. It won't take me long. We'll see you later. No, you have ignored me. We had combined $ 500. I love this hymn. Get out of here. Not before you pay me. I don't take all that money with me. Clear. Reassure yourself, I have what you need. It's ready, you just have to sign. You can not legally claim anything. Is that why you refuse to pay? Go away, please. It will create an unpleasant situation. I am dressed for combat. At the ceremony, they ask if there is anyone who has any reason to oppose marriage. You have to make people leave. He abandoned me. It was here, I saw you! He left. turned around, and was gone. I will kill you, I will kill you! Is this the man who picked me up? That I sought you ... Hey, a moment! Good night, Mrs. Swasey. I have to talk to you. What are you doing here? Your colleagues in the office advised me to pick you up in bars. understand that he was drunk. How can you do that to such a good girl? I'm sorry, I really am. But I couldn't help myself. Listening. Stop playing around and listen to me. Get the jacket. Angry! Taste with one that weighs less. Place, it can still be arranged. Let's blame the nervousness. I'm very calm. I will not marry her. What is the reason for this sudden change? Last week, it was all joy. You were excited about her beauty. I never said such a thing. Ah ... I was talking about your new office, this grand and new office. I prefer to marry a woman. He had to think about it before asking for his hand. Who knows how it happened? Unexpectedly and suddenly, I found myself compromised. This is all normal. This passes nine times out of ten. I came to get you. Get your jacket. Listen, Mrs. Swasey, if I could have done it, I would have stayed there. I realized at the hotel. Ina told everyone about her bouquet of flowers. His father told everyone about the gift he had given us. Then I saw your mother and her fangs protruding. And I realized that in 20 years, Ina will be like her. It could be much worse! Mrs. Kuschner is a sweet and distinguished woman , and I'm proud to meet you. What are you laughing at? Oh you're welcome! It's curious that you say that when we know that ... What do you know? Oh nothing... The only time I told you about you ... Give me two coke. That said? Nothing nothing... Spit it out! He called it "faded". But no, look at you! How can an old woman like her say that! Is that your gratitude? First, send me your monstrous daughter, and then, you don't want to pay me! Pay? You should have paid me at the end of the matter. But it didn't end well! I do not understand you. It's simple, isn't it? What did you think of my back pain story ? Did you think Ina came to my house by chance? Yes, so far. It was a plan. I joined her with you. I don't understand why. It's my job. I manage a marriage agency . Devils! You mean that... who has one of these clubs? Don't you tell people that? Usually yes. But sometimes you have to approach it carefully. Like mine, for example! "Find the spider and tell where the fly is." And I knew! Something seemed suspicious ... I'm out of the game now, aren't I? I no longer have a role to play! Do you know what I'm going to tell you? I'm glad of that. Lose $ 500 and I'm glad! Imagine the Kuschners sitting around the prepared banquet? For this lofty reception that there will be no one! All that food! That horrible bag of bones will eat chicken for a month and a half. Mrs. Swasey ... Normally, I should give you a beating! But I prefer to give you a hug. No grudge? Friends? Like brothers! Mrs. Swasey, I love you. Good... I just skipped the page. It's over, I won't get married again. Someday I will find a beautiful doll ... You will have many, but just to pass the time. I have no means of getting married. Of course. I'm going to dedicate myself to having real fun, now. Good decision. Relax! Come see me sometime. We can discuss, play cards ... - Does it look like Sunday? - Accordingly. I'm always home on Sunday at noon. Goodbye, see you. Sunday at noon ... Let's see if we get along. His name is Matt Hornbeck. Do you understand? If he comes, don't tell him you have a daughter. You are an old friend of the family, understand? Can I tell you that I am one of the biggest cider producers? Yes, but don't tell him anything about your daughters. You don't have to suspect anything. I have an idea. Someday, take him for a walk around my land. We'll nail the road and bang! You will have to come and fix the tire at my house! Mr. Perry ... It was just a suggestion. Everything is ready, Doberman. Won't we play? It's time for coffee and cookies. Sit down, Mr. Perry. Read this book. So you'll know what to discuss. Radiology treaty. Hazel touches that it is wonderful. Turn that off! Take a walk, dear. There is coffee and cakes. Mr. Wixted and you are together, like a picnic, right here. Sit down. A little intimacy ... - Help yourself, everyone. - Gentlemen, help yourself. Oh finally! Was he having fun? Have you ever seen fish walking in the rain? I? Are you crazy? Oh, did you walk? Look, did you hear that? I introduce you to my friend Delia Seaton. Come from the fish bay walking! This is my friend, Hjalmar Johannson. An interesting name. Are you swedish? Do you speak Swedish? Speak Swedish! You have enough with the Swede, both! Sit down. I want you to get to know each other well. He knows, there is another way for my daughter to meet him randomly. As a baby, Rosie played with her mother's earring. In one day he swallowed it. We took her to do an X - ray. Could another be swallowed? It was just a suggestion. Thanks for the coffee, but I must go. Come on, don't be silly. The fun is just beginning! Now, let's make a joke. All the men, here, in line. First, I tie this to the left wrist. Then, I do the same with the right wrist. So, that way. Who will we put him with? Delia Seaton, come here. No, Mr. Wixted does not correspond to him. Hazel, you will look good. Never played! You have some precious wraps! - Is not true. - But I think. Now... It is very kind. The game is to separate yourself from the other as soon as possible without undoing the bandages. Who is next? I've played this before ... Yes, and it ended in Nedick ... Who will you want with you? Delia! You know, the games and I ... Come on, don't be afraid. That, just like that. Now, Let's start! Ready? Action! Go! Don't set traps, Mr Wixted! Very well, Hazel. My finger! I am really sorry. My finger! Is that so. You see, when Mr. Hornbeck is here, we'll make you play a little too. While I wait, can I play with that blonde? Mr. Perry, you're a married woman. It was just a suggestion. Mrs. Gingras, come have some fun. Doberman, here, tie them up for me. Do you want to play too? Have you ever played this before? Hello, can I talk to you for a moment? Aren't you ashamed to talk to me? This raincoat is a marvel to you! - I look like a gangster, don't I? - Come on, come in. Oh, I'm sorry, you're with guests. So-so. I'll be back another time. No, let's go to my room. My arm is tied My hat! You already know what a Sunday is just at home. I was walking around the park thinking about our discussion the other day and I came to apologize. Come on, punch me! No, but again, I will do it with pleasure. Is there anything else? I have good news. Take this off. It interests you, doesn't it? Did he leave you? No, it shows that I was wrong. You misjudged him. He even asked for my hand. Do you want to form a trio? They are going to divorce. Oh, better this way. Doesn't that look good? So will the wife stay out of the game? Cheers, how did you get it? I did not do nothing. They haven't understood each other for years. She is very inclined to argue. It seems you know her well ... although he ignored its existence until recently. I never knew much. So tonight we're going to a place where nobody knows us. You must want to tell me something. Tonight? I told him to stop by to pick me up here. Very well. Anyway ... You didn't break everything, she did it for you. That's right. was lucky to be around at the right time. So you don't have to take another woman's misfortune into your conscience. Who is it? Mrs. Swasey, I won! Perfect, how wonderful. Now, invite him to dinner. So, Mr Wixted, did you win? Make a pair of scientists! Listen to me, now! It's late, and we already had a lot of fun . That's right. As Emily Pos said, "To say goodbye to the guests, you have to tell them". It must be terrible for a woman. What? Let a man leave his wife. Ah, that. First, she will find herself abandoned. Only later will understand that he not only took his clothes and socks when he closed the door but he stripped her of her womanly pride. Something horrible happens! One day she happens to fix some gift he gave her. And remember that he bought the gift on credit and said: "I will love you for life". And before paying the gift, he had already abandoned it. He no longer loved her. He stopped loving her before the last payment on the watch. And then, his pride disappeared for good. Is that so ... Anyway, can we not stop looking after the problems of others? It is true. But do n't find yourself in that situation again that I can tell you: "You broke my marriage." Almost everyone says so. What time will you go to look for it? Around six, I think. It's almost. Listen, go touch up a little bit. I'll fix the room a little. Mrs. Swasey, I think I am leaving. Where were you? He's gone. I asked you to go. Mrs. Swasey! I told you that you left 10 minutes ago. Mrs. Swasey, I'm sorry to ask you, but why that? I tell you why: You are not strong enough for that. This is not true. You didn't come here to tell me "I'm sorry about that". He was looking for someone to lean on. I was a little afraid. Is that a crime? If you can't make a decision, yes. Be smart, dear. You have an opportunity out of ten to be happy behaving like that. A girl like you deserves better than that. Sending him out is not a solution. You will wait for me in front of my house in the car. So, don't go home. Spend the night here. That settee cost me $ 90! It's tomorrow? I can't hide forever. Tomorrow will be another day for you. Everything will be different, the sun will shine and you will see everything differently. But at least, this discussion did not take place on a rainy Sunday afternoon in a decadent restaurant. We often go out to dinner. Don't go tonight. You have to refuse a first glass if you want to stop drinking. What do you say, dear? I'll try. They have never looked so bright for me. I could forget to give you back .... I am sure your combinations are much better. Lay down. I already made the bed. I ate like a trucker. Sleep like you're one. Good if I could! What prevents you? I think men go from bad to worse. When you know someone, or are a poor man, or you are a scoundrel. You see, an adventure every now and then! It goes well for morals. There is no need to abuse it. In my neighborhood, such a smart girl had to leave. That is not the problem. It is difficult to find a man who can be liked. All women say that. Men are getting worse and worse. Try to close your eyes soon. Perhaps tomorrow the problems will disappear. Do you know something crazy? I almost got arrested by a boy named Jamie Egan. Who was? A boy from Fort Wayne. It was perfect, everyone said that. Did it last long? He asked me to marry him. I wanted to go live in the Sherwood woods. Where is that in New Jersey? In England, where Robin Hood lived. If I had met him! Smart, fun ... In the field, he knew the names of all the flowers. The same with the stars. Why didn't they get married? We were ten years old. Her family and Troy moved in that summer. They worked at Westinghouse. Well, how can you compare to an adult with a child of that age? Why not? It is totally impossible. At 25, Robin Hood is no longer playing. It's not about this. Why do they change so much when they grow up? And you ask me? You know everything about men, don't you? I keep believing in love. You're right. Good night, now. Good morning, Mrs. Swasey. Good morning darling. I can't find it! I've been sweeping the entire apartment! Ah, a moment! I found! A sugar cube! What are you looking for? I lost my earring. I thought I would find you. He let go while cooking. And in the tank? I didn't touch the dishes! Was it valuable? No, no, that’s not it. Just a moment, I made you the bed last night. Is it under the cushions? I already looked. I've been wanted since six in the morning! You have a deep dream. Do you know what I dreamed of? With your omelet, I ate almost whole! Almost? Ate all! I just drank a glass of milk. I thought he would leave me a little, but he didn't even speak! What's wrong with him? Is nothing. Well, I think I looked everywhere. Now, I'm safe. It must have fallen when I was hitting the eggs. I would deserve to be hanged! Because? Feel good? Very well ... Anyway, I think. Does it hurt you if you press like that? And so? Not at all. There is no need to risk making it worse. We have to find a doctor. You think... You need to do an emergency radiography. I'll try to find a clinic in the neighborhood. I would have realized if I had swallowed anything! Ready, Srta. Bennett? We're wasting time. Mr. Hornbeck. Good Morning. What is it about? He thinks an earring has been swallowed . My friend thinks that, not me. I have no symptoms of pain .... Have you eaten breakfast? No. Be quick, I'm hungry. Accordingly. Breathe in deeply. So keep your lungs. It expires and it seems. Breathe normally, go around. Half a turn or a quarter turn? What was that earring for? - It was coral. - And swallowed it? Inside an omelet. Breathe again, and stop. It's possible? Maybe you see something? No. What doctor sent you here? None, my friend thought it would be better if I came here quickly. Usually, my patients come on medical advice. This seemed like something urgent, and it was your friend who ... - Who is it? - Mrs. Swasey. Mrs. Swasey? We can turn on the light again. Hello, Mrs. Swasey. As far as I am concerned, I can assure you that there is nothing to fear. God knows where that earring will be, but it is not inside your body. It's better now? Not totally. We are going to visit a doctor for real. Come on, Mrs. Swasey. Call him immediately. Do you even want to use my phone, Mrs. Swasey? Definitely yes. This way. You can get dressed now. Dr. Abner, Dr. Achelis, Dr. Ackroyd ... They seem competent, but which one will be single? What do you imply? Go... As I didn't go on Sunday, so you come to me! What are you talking about? Lower the tone, Mrs. Swasey. What about it? It is beautiful enough not to need you. I can not believe. So you think ... Listen, she doesn't know anything about my activities. I lost 10 years in a minute, the strength to ask myself ... if you're not the most convinced of the men I've ever met. Who do you think you are, Mr. Hornbeck? He's not even a doctor. He barely makes $ 80 a week. 75. You are among the most beautiful girls in the city. Listen to me, piece of idiot. Imagine that Miss. Kitty Bennett is a model at the Russeks house. Parades every Tuesday and Friday. While parading with these combinations, do you know who will see her? Marlene Dietrich? Paulette Goddard? Gene Tierney? All New York singles with something in common. Your cadillacs are parked at the door. Tips are very generous. They give the doorman 5 dollars and tell him to keep the change. But she aspires higher. What you want is a radiologist to find the earring she swallowed. I will eventually find her ... This young girl honors me with her friendship, and do you think I'm interested? Okay, I think. Mrs. Swasey, you were right. I had the earring from the beginning, hooked to my dress. Do you realize, Mr. Hornbeck? It was hooked behind your back! Well, I give it to you. Take the other one, it will bring you luck. - I can not. - Of course, come. I am very nervous. Do it yourself. With pleasure. I am really sorry! Come on, come on, we have to go. One moment, I have to pay. Pay? Because? You found it yourself, didn't you? Where do I pay? You owe me nothing. Fasting? Let us eat together and in peace. Miss. Bennett and I have breakfast together. We would not bother you by preventing you from working. For 75 a week! Some liver patients are waiting for you ... Mom, do what you want. There's enough to make the menu and do something different when you get home. Anything, anything ... But don't make tuna again! Okay, okay, turn it off, you have to hit a card. See you later, Mom. "A pianos Schubert". Are they or are you the one who owes me the salary? That is the tenor. "Honorable... " "I'm sorry about this month's promissory note." "I'll get it as soon as I can." "I hope you find this solution convenient, since this piano is very important for my activity. One of my friends, passing by my house, told me that the sound of that piano was unfortunate, without intending to offend you. Cordially." Well, go up. This woman, here? What woman? If you're coming, tell him I'm not here today. I do not understand. Get rid of it! Looking for Mrs. Swasey? - Is not. - Thanks. Do you know when you will return? No. Would you like to leave him a message? Tell him I called. I'm Mrs. Swasey. Thanks. Thank you, we will do the rest of the letter later. One minute, what is it about? I didn't want to see her. It says it's called Swasey. She say yes. Is it your family? It is very beautiful! She was. Let 's talk about something else. Don't be so sensitive, I was kidding. Can you tell us who we're going to look like? Who? We don't want any calluses! Let me speak. We want to hire you. To start talking, will it be worth $ 6.50? tell her that if she is an idiot, daddy won't want her. Daddy? It's for our father. We saw your ad that speaks of "loners". Dad is one of them. With children like that? It needs someone adult. For 3 years, he always behaved like that. Come home, eat and stay with us. This is very sad. Why didn't he come himself? You don't know any of this. That suits you very much! But if you know that, we'll get some spanking. Come in here, children. Sit down. Keep that money Sit down. Something quite different happened. Oh no, no. Are you standing? I just wondered. Joanne, look at the clasp! They invited me to dinner. We are back to square one! A dinner with him ... "Kitty, I already know I 'm a mess ..." We have already made this story clear . We'll have dinner together tonight. It is not about him. Do you remember the radiologist? Today came to the parade. I wore a bathing suit. And there he was! Ah, that guy! you must have followed it, until you found it! Dinner with him is not so serious. I wouldn't worry, run less quickly than you do. Well, I have to go, I'm at the top of the job. Goodbye! I'll be right there, kids! A dozen roses. Where were we? Ah yes! Go there a little bit. This should be simple. I'm lucky! I have another meeting at Saturday Evening Pos ... Did it take me a long time? Your work helps you to look very beautiful! Are you interested in the external aspect? It is a great extreme tibia, yes ... Extreme tibia? The bones in your legs are exceptional. I eat a lot of vegetables. Where are we going? Where do you want to go, to the Village? If I choose tonight, you choose morning. We will alternate this month at least. I don't make long-term plans. Go up to the back. Where are you from? If I tell you about Fort Wayne, I will want my family details. Then we'll talk about yours, and the night will be spent on it! Combined, let us be orphans. Forgive me. Did I sign the order? I do not know. Why did you do that, boy? An impulse. Never gave him that, a sudden craving for orange ice cream? This has nothing to do. We barely know each other! We are on May 10th. Would you want a kiss on June 10th? I suppose not. Why lose in a month, then? We are not eternal. It just says nonsense. No? We are in no hurry until the 10th of June. Please leave July for after dinner. They closed the restaurant just in the best part. Seeing as dancing, we risked being arrested! I like to dance very close. Don't like music? I live here. Beautiful, isn't it? I call it the "Hurlevent Basses". Charming. Well good night. Yes of course. I spent a wonderful night. For me too! Are we leaving tomorrow? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. It's wonderful. If it were mine, I would have you in a shop window. We couldn't see each other! Yes, I would live inside it! - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Could you come in? It's late, and I get up early. It is not so late. Come on,. + Go away. Won't we be kissing every night? This is not bad. Come on, let's go ... Goodbye. We could hear some music. No, no, no. Go away. I spent a wonderful night. I am thirsty. - What? - Do you have coke? Buy at any store. They will be closed. We will see... I'm not sure I have. What is this? Flores. Put it on the table. There is no card. They are not very fresh. It may be inside. What? The card. Yes No doubt. Put them in the water. I'll do that later. Do it now, if they won't get spoiled. The card is also not inside. I wonder who sent them. You must know, if they would not take a card. I do not know. Nobody sends flowers to a woman without being sure that you know who sends them. Drink your coke right away. It's already 2 o'clock. A bunch of roses without a card! I am no longer thirsty. Goodnight. Call me between 12:00 and 13:30, if not, the call will not go through. Of course. Listen, Mr. Perry, if you've waited 24 years to get married, you can wait a few more days that won't make a difference. Forget about that doctor, I can't offer you. Furthermore. he is not even a real doctor. But of course I keep looking. Relax, Mr Perry, we will find something suitable. That is. See you later. Take a bullet. What you want? Do you want to know who I've been seeing? I'd love to... With your friend, Kit Bennett. It is not for you. Tell me about it. Who is this man? What man? You are friends! A guy who sends you bouquets of flowers. This starts to work ... Do not become the mysterious. Who is it? You don't know her, but it is right for her. Beautiful, with a beautiful house ... It will give you a lot of security! Moneyed, according to all reports, and seeks his better half. You swore to me that you were one of your friends, and not something else. And she is, but I had a customer in mind. But what a face you have! She's the most beautiful girl in town, she had no right to do that! Do what? Throwing her in a man's arms . Let her choose the man herself . And my commission? Tell him when to return, that is caught in its claws. Tell him, since it interests you! We don't waste our time talking about you. I will tell you the real reason. It is a subject that you are avoiding talking about. What subject? What I'm thinking, and what you want to hide: The wedding. But you prefer the single life. I just wanted to spend a season having a good time. What does this have to do with it? Everything has to do. You! Do you have cigarettes? No ... Take a bullet. No, let's get back to the subject. Okay, do you want to marry her? - Who said that? - You do not... How could I get married? You know me, $ 75 a week ... Many people are satisfied. Three million in this city alone ! I can't tie myself up, right now. My career first. I must make progress. Can't you see I can't get married? Nonsense! Anyone can stand long enough to say "yes" and get married. And I like her, you know. I do not say that in one day I will not do it! That day, if it's available, I'll let you know. You're lucky to be a woman ... Isn't he a wonderful man? An authentic Robin Hood. Why are you so upset? I asked him about his intentions. Court. Remember that Russeks doll? Oh, is that? And this brute? It's done. Well, almost. Phase one, OK. Phase two, OK. Now, you must say "yes". Who will pay the commission? Neither. I did not understand. He never had so many debts, and he despises the commission! You already know that Mae Swasey is a little crazy. I spend so much time with these people, trying to get married, to light the spark ... And now I have a prairie burning, for a change! Play, play. I had a great plan like that ... Listening. "The Empress of Bermuda ... and your wonderful vacation on a splendid 9-day cruise ". I'm already on the cruise ... I quit! Go out a couple of times with a man and you're already on a cloud! At least, it makes you radiant. I hated the one you left before. I know that, never again. It's over, I don't care anymore. Bea. Guess who's here? Don't you recognize me? Of course, we met at Mrs. Swasey's. Guess why I came. My dowry! Mr Wixted and I ... Wonderful news! Bea, maybe ... It is not very practical. Try another shelter. Look at these others. Poor Hazel! Mrs. Swasey took her commission, but I don't think he'll say "yes". Mrs. Swasey ... Tell me, when are the sales? About 20% will arrive in mid -July. I'll be back then. I didn't understand a thing. What does Mrs. Swasey have to do? He forced our man to accept. Your ad clearly says, "Success guaranteed with Ms. Swasey." Bea, give me your opinion. See you later. Only? Shy? Disappointed? Consult Mrs. Swasey. Never believe what you read in the press. Here it is: "Contacts and contracts". Here it is, here we are. Hey, anyone at home? We came to get a contact! Is there anyone at home? Look, here it is, the little lady! I introduce you to my friend, who is terribly alone! Can you heal him? It's very shy and shameful ... We have four tickets for a show ... I am also a man ... it would be a shame to lose them. Will you find us girls? Now you will see something! - Out of here! - Do not do it. They are nothing but rude! Go! They didn't come to the right place, and tell your friends about it. Gentalha! I called Russeks, and they told me he was gone. Come in, let's go. What do these two pigs look like to you ? They come every week. Honey, we have to talk seriously. It's going well with Matt. I even knew that before you did. Come on, come in, dear. You need to know how to understand him, but he has a good future. Now he says he doesn't want to get married! But you can arrange for him to accept. Look at how to do it. First, put the honey in your mouth. I introduced a fictional man into your life. Did you like the roses? Mr. Hornbeck was very nervous. Now, don't see him for a week. Let me call you, wait ... You will be very busy, right? It will do well. Men only bite the apple if they think others want it. Attention, you! I forgot my hat. Have you seen such a thing? Why didn't you tell me what kind of business you have? I do not know. Should I have said? Yes, before interfering in my life. It is not so serious. Hearing it, it seems like something infamous ... Your agency and its intrigues, that is terrible. Don't take it wrong! There is nothing terrible. Marry people for money? Did you come here just to tell me that? I never thought I could go through something like this. I had no intention of charging them , either. Thanks, but I don't want a man who refuses to get married. I'm not that needy! Do not continue to intrigue for you to love me. But he already loves you! Thanks to Mae Swasey's maneuvers , whose success is guaranteed. Do me a favor. Erase my name from your files. Wait. I recognize that I intruded into your life, but it was up to here with problems. I would do the same for my own daughter. Find another daughter. It's dark here, don't you turn on the light? Not tonight, Doberman. Oh, that's right, Mae. We play tomorrow, eh? By the way, the announcement for the month of July ... Do what we agreed. Yes Yes. He knows... What I mean is ... we'll have to forget about that for a while. Don't you want more? Sometimes it passes. They want to clear their name from time to time. They may receive complaints from feminist groups. In a little while, they'll beg you to go back to setting. I had the same problem with the hormonal pills. You know, many people are not very good, and they are very ungrateful. Last November, the newspaper canceled everything. But today, there is nothing to do. Of course. - Good night, Doberman. - OK mother. I didn't know you were already on your feet. I passed your office many times . I've been told. From 20 years ago, you have aged a lot. Did you hear that Frank died? Yes, I read in the press. You must think that I have little shame for coming here to see you ... I was on my way and I do n't have time to argue. How can you still be hurt, Mae? So much time has passed. Husbands don't appear to women every day! Now, we don't have one, not one of us. Listen, Emmy, my train leaves at eleven twenty. Come a moment, quickly. I have no contact with anyone. I didn't know who to turn to. I have a nice house, money ... But what is that for? Do you know what time I go to bed? Sometimes at six in the afternoon. I wake up at two in the morning, every night is hell. It is terrible to find yourself so alone! The same thing said to me twenty years ago, Emmy. You are a strong woman, Mae. You have your feet on the ground, and you have many friends. Don't leave me alone between those four walls. Tell me what to do. Help me! Don't do it for my pretty face or anything! Consider me a client. Just a moment, let's make things clear. Do you want me to find you a husband? I could say it another way ... I just want to meet people. Well, Emmy is looking for a man, again! Before, I would fix you up in droves. Men our age are either dead or married. It's very difficult, when you were so young and beautiful as I was. The boys smiled at me gratefully! Now, I must look stupid, just by looking at them. Can you help me? I can not do this. He hates me, he knew that. No, that’s not it. Not anymore, not a little bit. I even have reasons to like you, now. It's like reminded me of Frank. Will you help me then? No, go look for others. Others? Who? There are many agencies. You will find them in the phone book. No, Mae, it can't be. But it came to me! Yes, but I knew you. I would never go to that kind of place! I would be ashamed of myself! Those places! It reminds me of something from before! I'm sorry, Emmy, you were out of luck. It has nothing to do with you. It's just that I'm leaving the business for a while, maybe forever. Many people are ashamed of doing business with someone like me. I'm sorry, the place is closed. Closed? It is not open. It changes all my plans. I came from New Brunswick. I thought I would find happiness here . It is a real pity. He thought she was the only one to be trusted. Found a good wife to a friend and could find one for me. Is Mrs. Swasey sick? I came to return this to you. She presented me with these earrings. Leave it on your desk. Where did Mrs. Swasey go? To Sharon Springs, to treat two coasts. Any more questions? No thank you. Mr. Hornbeck called, I wanted to speak to you. If you don't want to know more about him, tell him that, so you don't call me anymore. I am really sorry. If you call again, tell him I went to Bermuda. Is it your phone? I would like to leave my address. Of course. I have to speak to Mrs. Swasey. I need! Is not. Everything was going so well ... Mrs. Swasey can not leave me like this. Look, we'd better go ... Come on, don't be a child. I did exactly what she told me. Everything was going well. Delia liked me. Then, this Sunday ... Mrs. Swasey told me to bring her a gift to her family when I went to see them. Now, Delia doesn't talk to me anymore. Perhaps that is not what displeased her. It bothered him that I said how much the gifts had cost. Don't laugh, I don't care what they cost. I thought it might interest you. This is not so serious. It will surely pass. Call her and talk about it. She doesn't want to talk to me, she says it's all over! Mrs. Swasey could do little ! She would tell me what to do. She would tell you to send her flowers with a card. Flowers? What kind of flowers? What kind of flowers? Roses ... Pink roses! Pink roses. What do I write to you on the card? Oh, whatever you want. You’re pretty big enough to know that. - Do it yourself. - I? - Do it. - But... This is ridiculous. Please, miss, please. I will send you half a dozen pink roses. A dozen, or even two. - Yes ma'am. "Dear Delia, I don't tell you what it cost me." "But I do say how much I love you" Come on, won't you cry again? How much do I owe? How? Is nothing! Mrs. Swasey always charged me. I am not Mrs. Swasey. Thanks. It's not Mrs. Swasey, not even far. But you are the one who made her sick. Do you know what you've done now? The same as she would. Understanding people, help them when they need ... What nonsense! You don't understand it. You are beautiful. The people who come here are not so lucky. Look at yourself! Will find ordinary women, men with thinning hair. They need help and support. They do not find it easy to express their emotions. "Só"? "Tímido"? Graceful words to read in an ad! This is no fun when it comes to you. But, look, sometimes nature comes to play a hand. There is no need to despise those who help others. Mr Doberman, I do not despise Mrs Swasey. Well, not anymore. I despise these activities. How do you think she started this? She thinks that on a good day she said: "I set up a marriage agency". "I'm going to take advantage of those single bastards". No, when Mae's wedding went downhill, found himself very alone. I would have to come to that, to be as alone as she was, to be able to understand it. You are not in these files. But there's a hollow here. Do you know that for her, it was like a daughter, it could never have. That's why you did him so much damage. Congratulations, Ms. Bennett, and have a good day ... Once you return, I want to talk to her. I will tell you that I am not looking for a graceful girl. I need a woman for real who can speak harshly to my fishermen, and even me, if necessary. I keep your data, I can't do more. See you later. I have to react. I have two neighbors. These witches chase me. If I don't get married, I'll end some of them. I called him already. After you. Can you come back to Mrs. Swasey's office with me ? He is well. Try to be more precise about what you seek ... The poor girl died at the age of 78. It is dangerous to lose so much. You should visit another doctor. For what? I told him it was a teeth problem! The same goes for my knee. Good Morning. Very beautiful here. These trees ... I have always loved these verses: "Only God created trees ..." Who else would have time for this? I knew it! You're from New York! I always recognize the girls in New York. The truth is, I'm no longer a girl. I do not know. I know them, Mrs. Swasey. Who told you my name? Meet her in the hall! The buttons must be able to earn a living! I’m Dan Chancellor. Tell me, do you play cards? No, I never knew. I wanted to take a walk around the city, would you join me? I do not think so. It's lunchtime already, there are iron prawns to eat. The cook is very good. I do not think so. I'm surprised, I shouldn't be eating fried food. Why not? It will ruin your figure, which is quite beautiful. Do you think that? It could be the weather that makes me feel so good. maybe we can go to the city, and eat there. I'll have a salad or something. Just what we need! We'll have a good time. She is the first woman I know in this city. You are what you were looking for. Western Union, telegrama! It's almost time to get some air. It's all right. One moment please. Come on, get out. I already tipped you. It was when I came. I heard him. But what's going on? I was told that I was on vacation. I'm. I was told I was in Bermuda, or somewhere else on vacation! Then? Does it matter? Go away, I hope someone. At 8 in the morning? I must get dressed, clean up the apartment a little. We will talk later. I want to know something. Where have you been? I've been busy out of town. Why did not you call me? I even thought about it, but why, if you don't want to get married. I don't blame you. I would swear that Swasey is behind this. Nothing like that. I understand. The important thing is your career! I do stomach X-rays! Won't you want to remain an employee? Better to be independent. It cannot remain stuck. A lot of people get comfortable, three million, just here. Perhaps it makes them unhappy. Don't you aspire to something better? Ohh, I'm touched by you. Speak like a teacher. Maybe we don't love each other? I didn't want us to argue. What if my answer was "yes"? I would have hooked you! Hooked? How? In many ways. We took a while without seeing each other, and see you again now. If I throw myself into your arms and kiss you, will be hooked! You place too much importance on your kisses. I started kissing as a teenager. It was not the first. There is nothing more trivial than a kiss. I like you. I'm in love with you. I want us to get married. Maybe I'm not my own boss for a while ... But I will be very happy, if I have you at home. Kit, I want you so much. Because you... Have a visit. Attention, it's important. Important? Don't forget what you said now. Wait, maybe you have to come back with me from here. - Mrs. Swasey! - Did you receive my telegram? I just got back. I wanted to apologize ... Ah, I missed you so much! No, he was right. Love must come by surprise, like when we fall into a hole. Getting people married is fine for tourists. Come on, Mrs. Swasey ... It's me. Don't look for more candidates, because it's mine. Sometimes, some cases work ... But it is preferable that it occurs naturally, you know? That's all I have to say. Good luck. I have to go. Wait, turn around, so we can see you. I notice something changed in you. Am I younger in this outfit? Exactly! That's what they tell me. Will you keep talking about dirty little secrets for a long time? They are waiting for you in the laboratory. Not yet. I must go and do the manicure. Manicure, new clothes ... What's going on, Mrs. Swasey? I just wanted to be beautiful. Something's wrong here ... Matt, can you bring us a cup of coffee? Come on, tell me everything. I can count you. A man fell madly in love with me. This is wonderful! It happened during my stay there. Do you like my hairstyle? Rejuvenates, doesn't it? At least, in a few months. Years! How old do you think I am? Does matters? - Forty. - What did I tell you? 39. In any case, he wants us to get married. Does not care. He only wants one thing, that we are happy. Well, when are you getting married? Do you think I take this seriously? Why not, if he's a good man. And he is very good, and very good character. He's an important guy in New Brunswick. It has a fishing fleet. Has a mansion on a peninsula that is your property. So, marry him today! I do not know. It's a little formal. But we had a good time in Sharon Springs. Have you been there too? Thank you, leave it there. What did you mean by "too"? Kit told me that he had also been to Sharon Springs. Go away! If not, I'll kill you before we get married! Marry me! It's all I wanted here! See you at night. - What did you do in Sharon Springs? - Was everything okay over there? No, not enough. - Well, I suppose it all started there! It was going little by little. I met him there. I knew him ... In your office! And took you there? Why not? We all have a matchmaking side ... Yes, for the youngest ... There is nothing new for the elderly. Do not do so. That's life. My big dream! He went to get a woman in a horrible agency ... Don't be tough about it. Have you ever imagined that? I fell into my own game. You should go to the psychoanalyst. They are made for each other. You won't be alone again! Only... Thank you for remembering that. There, on that peninsula, there are no more than gulls to talk to. Can anything worse? Will you stop screaming and listen to me? You know what? I'm going to be bored to the point of dying with this guy. When I tried to teach you to play cards, soon tried to give up. You will teach him! You no longer learn to play at fifty. It's just ... Listen, baby. When we are dealing with people who are alone, we are no longer alone. Remember that. He's a good guy, don't refuse him. I'll take care of him. You need a woman. You already told me ... Hi, this is Mae, are you busy? Don't ask me so many questions and go to my office. Vemo-nos ali. Mother? Came back? Of course, yes! What a brunette you are! And that hairstyle? Did everything go well? It's all right? - Listen, we'll talk later. We're not talking much here ... Come in! I came in a taxi. Sit down. I thought about you a lot. I think I found the man who needs it. Let me talk. Is there nothing better than putting you in that burial dress? Of course! So, put something else. Look at that face. Less lipstick and no nail polish! Go to the cinema on 43rd Street today at noon. At the box office he will say the name of Chancellor. The man who sits next to you will be him. Left or right? I don't know, but it will be there. He has big blue eyes. Tell him that I couldn't go. So what do I do next? If your memory is not bad, you know what to do, right? It seemed to me that you were back. Okay? Then I'll see you, you 're busy. You can stay, we're done here. Mae, you're an angel. Just a moment! I don't do this for your pretty face. How much did you inherit from Frank? We will talk later. But as we wake up, I'll give you the invoice. Yes, Mae, yes. How is he like? It is very well. I almost stay with him myself! Come on, let's get on with business. Court. You were very smart. It was not for you. Who knows who is right for whom? You know, Mae, needs someone sweeter. Like me, for example. Polish, we have something in common, we could try it. Come on, come on, play!
