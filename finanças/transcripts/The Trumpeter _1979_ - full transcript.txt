You saw in this direction armed men? Gyula. Yeah? Refresh their recollection. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get down, rascals. Worshipful lord. No! Up! Did you see somebody? I remember something already, my Worshipful lord. We saw some kind of riders. They galloped at dusk, than the rabid devils. Did you see them already? Two of his days we were camping together in the Mures forest. They were preparing to visit into a some kind of wedding party. How many people were they? Was a woman. And there were a boy, their slave with a trumpet. It is a lost corpse. Do you recognise them? Yes, Worshipful lord! The crows filched, the Sun blew up their cheek. They were, Worshipful lord. Did you see the aggressors? We saw riders Wonshipful lord. You will burn in the fire of the hell There is warmth here, my Wonshipful lord. Warmth?! Drink, my Wonshipful lord. Drink! Good wine. Cheers! There is good wine like this in this barrel. What did you see? A morning was early, we saw something hardly. They were many people. We are afraid. They do not spare the innocent ones. Do not be afraid. The county protects you. We do not allow you not to be allowed to make your free trade. We opened our eye well because of that. One of the aggressors lay down for bait under a harpoon. Like this. His hand tied. Here his neck sticked Bait? Old Kuruc tactics. But worked well. More men rushed from the forest, with an axe, a weapon, pistols, with a dagger. They killed all. They robbed the victims. Talk about the pillaging Kuruc. Heavy to recognise anybody. The forest is full of with Th?k?ly's men Here a lot the horse hoof trace These already that of our horses Who would be able to distinguish the horse traces? where did they go? This way. That way. What shall we recognise them by? The boy is with them, from that direction to know. We would bear witness then, Wonshipful. lord. We heard that the county rewards the witnesses generously so. Go towards Tokaj, there is need now there the onto hard-working men. Do not take it away, do not take it away. This last one, there are not more. Let my tooth fall out if I bite into him Let the wine not feel longer his flavour. Throw down my bed, if I touch them. More hundred people are starving. We let us be feasting here? The Kuruc begs, the heyduck pillages, the German reduces everything to ashes You get it back hundredfold. After the victory. The Kuruc king comes back. The Kuruc king pulled Turkish dresses up. Moulted his faith. Trumpeter You. Fellow of Tokaj. Latent, (???) looter, bandit godless robber Kuruc dog See fellow Tokaji, you stayed on bad road. The got this from a Kuruc king in kid's age yet. Well take a look, maybe that your father made it so. You were our enemy's enemy, our friend's friend. Let a god help us so. Trumpeter If you would not hit the target. Protect it. All right, boy. Don't be afraid, escapes even from the hole of his ass because of this reek. The Turkish does it so. He is praying meanwhile only. You louse drover! Dear father lousier, than the Easter pilgrim. The rag is beautiful on a beautiful man. I desire a woman It me, too would scratch itself. We inaugurate the fellow. What does do? What was done, people? He gets drowned in it. Trumpeter, make a choice! Trumpeter. Please, no let this be made We want to give a joy to you Hop out from your pants. People help you! Cowardly worms! -Help you! -Leave it, the cow goes onto hell. These do not protect their mother! Drawn unarmed ones. All of the village saw that the Germans violated my wife. The unfortunate one did not get even a grave. My dear father reviles the killers. They are these! Allow it to run him away. No, no! Run home. Why are you doing this my dear father? Let her go! Do not leave yourself. Don't you get it? Let him go! Let me go! My dear father do not make this! Do not leave yourself. Let me go! Dear father Don't do it! Trumpeter What do you buy on him? Weapon! For what it for you, kid? You know it well. I avenge for my father and my mother. We avenge their death then. You look at your own joy only. We avenge all sylvan men. We buy weapons. Weapons, pistols, swords I had a good nose. It is a lost corpse. The description was accurate. It gets tanned my face the leather. It is not for you, only your cheek. This is true so. That's right. I sit down between you. I let you onto a long leash. Robbery, plundering, murder. There are a lot on your list of sins. We did not idle. You are careless. You are drunk instead of escape. You visited the cross. You were not able to keep your eye closing. We paid our respects to him. Deserved it He held out until a lot. He was shouting for revenge even on the rope. Havr?n second lieutenant avenges his death. Took even the password into his grave, he tried to find out two about my best man though. He talked about me. From Havr?n second lieutenant. He did not see your scabby cheek fortunately. He may have died in the hope of the revenge. Did he recognise you? Beside myself I wanted to receive it Would have been securely between the heyducks, but did not undertake the service. Trumpeter blow something onto the Wonshipful lord's respect. They brought the boy. It is possible to recognise them by it. The he's dead his heirs compiled it. They knew it punctually though what they waited for. Let us be watching circle. Wonshipful lord, we put your part aside. There it is. You lie, rascals. A whole village was sent by me in a gift, I carry everything. There is nothing there. You forget it that we served a lord? We drink water. Our glass is empty. Our weapon is empty. Take it! We are chased dogs. Carry it. Worshipful lord! Have mercy on us. Spare our life. You come into the city on the next week. You volunteered to witness. The county offered 10 golds to the one giving a clue. We are poor. Do not grudge it us Worshipful lord. Open the garbages well then. Your good day was today, rascals. You would need even the county's money. The tale-telling is worthless earnings. I'm sorry! Come on. Did you let it go away? He does not stop until three. Took all of our money away, from what we buy the weapons? We want calmness. Let the dog go. My dear fathers they get drunk and you let it rob yourselves? Did you forget about the revenge? We do not have to take vengeance Who? For you. You are young. I handled 10 men in my young age. Of this time I was a second lieutenant already. The Kuruc king is behind our place. Havr?n second lieutenant he himself is worth more at ten thousand labanc. From labanc we laid heaps. He pins the countryman onto his moustache. This second lieutenant is a cowardly worm. Frequented the villages violated the women. You. It is something else, my son. You saw that nobody shielded them. It is necessary to punish the cowardly ones. Give a weapon to me. You are worthy of him! For the homeland! Courage, countryman! He went away! The dogs lick his blood! The second lieutenant catches him then. The absent corpse will be. Right? Good morning, dear father! How about you? Do you live yet? A devil's bastard! I believed it already you carry the manure from under the devil's horse! Come on! I brought everything back. Pin these onto your moustache. The second lieutenant did not hurt it. The dog revealed our lair. There was best country. Here was a little of our calmness. Our place did not warm up. I take it away to dry onto a gallows! Bajusz. Towards the caves. That way. Keep the horses. Bring him. This kid's corpse missed. He was the Polish lord's trumpeter. The Kuruc brought him.

Onto this news Hegyalja is buzzing. What are you doing? Our leader is the Kuruc king's son. We found it finally. The real ones. We looked for the old heroes with messengers. We roam the forest because of this. We are not received already back up the Kuruc. Already the first vanguards would impede. We do not know the password. The Kuruc are cautious. We do not know the password. Ploughs his land with a sword, with blood harrows. This is the insurgents' password. You are a betrayer! Betrayer! What are you doing? Oh, my God. Dear father, what did you do? He was a betrayer. Labanc with a Kuruc cheek. The villages may be evicted, ... ...the men may be cleared they went away onto Hegyalja, ... ...anybody may clean the defenceless ones out. It made an attempt on your life, my son. I say thank you for my life to the dear fathers. Where you going? I take the betrayer out. I pull it in under a haystack. We have to guard it, a heap of shit may bring the heyducks into our trace. I will be his enemy's enemy, his friend's friend. Let a god keep me alive so. We can start! Come on! They deserve it! Into a picket with them! Let's go! It is necessary to flay them! Go on!
