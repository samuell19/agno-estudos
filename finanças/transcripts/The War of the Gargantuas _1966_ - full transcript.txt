Suzuki! Suzuki! Someone! Come herel Nurse. Visitors are not allowed. I am from the Maritime Safety Agency. He is in no condition to talk. Just for a few minutes, please. He hasn't regained consciousness yet. ...that is ... Frankenstein ... The only survivor is still unconscious. I see. Is he in danger? The doctor doesn't know yet. There were five in the crew. Four of them were trapped inside the cabin when the boat suddenly sank. It's only 100 meters to the shore. Even a child could swim that distance. Find anything? No one was inside. I found this on the outside railing. Did they drift ashore? - All four? - Yes. Why were they trying to anchor at this dangerous cape on such a dark night? Smuggling, maybe? The other four have disappeared. Were you at the wheel when the boat sank? How many times do you have to ask? As many as I want ... ...until you tell me the truth. Well didn't you see the others when you were swimming to the shore? I did! I saw all four! We all jumped into the sea at the same time. I told you before, Gargantua looks like a Frankenstein. He got the others before they got to the shore. I can't believe that. There is no Gargantua; he doesn't exist. Stop lying. When you investigate on the boat you'll see it didn't collide with anything, nor was it stranded. Gargantua lurched over ... and other four were ... If I were going to lie, I'd think of something better. Chief, we've discovered the cloths of the missing. Where? Between the boat and the shore. Why are they torn like that? They look like they've been chewed and spat out. Make a long distance call to Kyoto, office of the Dr. Stewart, the expert on Frankenstein. Hello. Yes. Just a minute. Professor, it's a call from Yokosuka Maritime Safety Agency. Yokosuka? Hello. This is Dr. Stewart. The Frankenstein we raised here died at Mt. Fuji. Yes. Frankenstein cannot be found in the ocean. Goodbye. What was that about? They say Frankenstein is still alive and eats humans. Can't be. Professor, some newspaper reporters are here. They want to ask about Frankenstein. Please sit down. Professor, could Frankenstein come back alive? It's possible. Is it possible? Frankenstein as died a few times, and has came back alive each time. Even if he came back to life, he would not live in the sea. Also, he wouldn't attack a boat or eat humans. Your opinion is that the incident at Misaki has nothing to do with Frankenstein. Yes, that's my opinion. Even if he is alive, I don't think he would eat humans. You are the one who raised him. I know him best. If you treat him kindly, he responds gently. No, no. You have to stop it. Are you already hungry? I will give it to you in a minute. No, not yet. Now you can drink them. Before he ran away from Kyoto, he came to say goodby to me. He did not harm any humans until he died at Mt. Fuji. Humans treated him badly. That's all. Thank you. Hey! Oh no ... What's wrong? DISASTER AT URAGA STRAIT UNKNOWN SHIPWRECK CONTINUES Oh, what is that? Everyone, run, run! It's a Gargantual Run, run! IS IT FRANKENSTEIN? TERROR AT MIURA PENINSULA. - DR. STEWART DENIES - Professor, they are blaming everything on Frankenstein. They've made him evil, but don't let it bother you. But Professor, even if it's not Frankenstein, shouldn't we clear him? Dr. Mamiya, is it necessary to investigate if he lives in the sea? Absolutely. That possibility created this commotion. If he were alive, he would be living on a mountain, far away from humans. Take a look at this. Do you think this is his footstep? Yes, we can't ignore the fact that it was discovered on the mountain. Let's check it out. If you are going to the mountain, I will go to Yokosuka. Wait. What's the matter? These marks look like they were scratched by a steel rake. Right. Have you found something? What was it? This is the mucous membrane that covers sea animals. Does this belong to Frankenstein? I am not certain, but it is a strong possibility. Wait, let's take a break. Where did you find the footstep? Right there. He jumped off that cliff and disappeared. Oh look, look!! There they are! - It looks like we have new material to study. - Yes. Hello. - It's ready. - Oh thank you. I think it belongs to Frankenstein. No other animal has this kind of cells. That's what I suspected. But why has he started living under the sea? Runway 17. Wind direction 180 degrees, 10 knots. Haneda Airport is in an emergency situation. All landings are prohibited! Abort landings. Haneda Airport is in an emergency situation. All landings are prohibited. Abort landings. Emergency! Emergency! Abort landings. Abort landings. Haneda Airport is in an emergency situation. Abort landing. No! No! No! No! No! Abort landing! Abort landing! Over there! Haneda Airport is in an emergency situation. Abort landing. Oh, you are back. Professor, have you any comment on the Haneda Airport incident? I have no comment. Give us some comments. We've just returned from the mountain and can't say anything yet. You've told us that Frankenstein is gentle and never hurts humans. - Any clues? - We'll tell you later. Everyone please be quiet. We are still in the middle of the investigation, so we have nothing to tell you yet. Please leave now. You must know something. Let me ask you one question. People believe all incidents beginning from the Third Kaishinmaru are caused by Frankenstein. What will you do now. I will investigate to find out the truth, I will leave for Tokyo immediately. I'm reluctant to attend a conference that would kill Frankenstein. I know, but we have to be aware of their plan. I still cannot believe it. Neither can I. ...that Frankenstein lives under the sea. He may fall in love with a whale. He may not be the same as the one on the mountain. This Gaugantua may not be the same as the one on the mountain. Say something? No ... nothing. DEFENSE MINISTRY Are they still in there? Professor, let us ask a question. Professor Mamiya. Professor Kida. Professors, please ... What is the defense strategy? First we will release strong electricity along the shore of Tokyo Bay to keep him from landing. How will you deal with him until this setup is ready? He does have a weakness. He is used to the dark under the sea, so strong light disturbs him. He's never come out when the sun is shinning. If we hadn't been critically misinformed that Frankenstein doesn't live in the sea ... ...Could we have avoided the tragedy at Haneda Airport? Dr. Stewart, any comment? You are right. That's all? Do you still intend to raise Frankenstein for your experiments? Yes, if it's possible. No, really?! The question is how. We don't seem to have the ability to do this now. That should be enough. Professor! Professor! Shall we go back to Kyoto? Imagine what will happen should Frankenstein appear in this peaceful place. We cannot leave here until we solve the mystery of immortal cells. In the meantime, we have to find a way to keep Frankenstein quiet. Turn on the lights. Turn on the lights. - Is there a doctor, any doctor? - I'm a doctor. Gauguntua is going to the mountain. Call 110! Call 110! Call the police. Is she all right? - Bring the stretcher. - Right. Garguantua hates flame or lights. Turn on the lights and open shades and curtains. Build bonfires in open spaces; Garguantua hates fire and lights. I repeat: The landing point is the mouth of Sakai River. The Self Defense Forces on standby have already started to take action. If you are in an evacuation area, follow the directions of the Self Defense Force. Garguantua hates fire and lights. Turn on the lights and open shades and curtains. Professor, do you think Frankenstein will go back to the mountain? I can't determine if he is Frankenstein until I get live cells. - Here. - Thank you. Let's go. I will give all the orders from Mobile Headquarters from now on. Yes sir. Hurry up! Hurry up! What are you doing? Mommy! Keil Kyo! What are you doing? Come quick! Let's go. Don't be late. Run, to the mountain behind us. Deploy! Prepare to light up! Lighting target downstream of Fuse River. Okay! Okay! Ready to light! Light up! From Defense Ministry to Mobile Headquarters. From Defense Ministry to Mobile Headquarters. Security measures are completed along the coast of Tokyo and Kanagawa. The Self Defense Fleet is ready to close off the sea. Is there an attack order, sir? No. But we can trap our target in this valley without causing damage to civilians. If we attack him, he will go on a rampage. We'll carry out Operation L first. Yes, sir. Company 3: After the landing, join under Toyoda Battalion Commander. Prepare to install laser arsenal. Distance 800. Present position at Highway 19, 300 meters from Point 5. Pull back! Pull back! It came out! Fire! Fire! Fire! Retreat! Cease fire! Cease fire! This is Headquarters. Who ordered the attack? All heavy artillery units will remain in their positions. All heavy artillery units will remain in their positions, sir. At present, the front line is positioned above 6 kilometers from Point 5 on Highway 19. We will capture Frankenstein here, before he moves into the mountains. We will carry out Operation L, which is to attack with laser and high-voltage electricity. This will be the end. Yes. Could his cells survive? Prepare for landing. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. Okay! Hurry, hurry! Circuit A, ready! Circuit B, ready! Circuit C, ready! Reverse current breaker. Ready! - Resistance, 250! - Ready- After the completion of the mission, the First Helicopter Battalion will confirm the target. We will inform you of the specific time of the attack. Roger. The target is slowing down. Speed up the preparation. Yes, sir. Headquarters! Headquarters! The target is approaching. The target is moving north on Interstate 4 towards Ohta bridge. Roger. The target is moving faster than we expected. Will they be ready in time? Yes, sir. - Communications are established. - Okay! - The parabolic mirror, ready. - Okay! - Launcher, ready! - Okay! The target is approaching. Increase speed. Understood. Distance 1200. Distance 1200. Distance 1200. Distance 1200. Distance 1200. Are you ready yet? Hurry. - Okay! - Okay. Number one positive line ready. -Number one positive line ready. Number one negative line ready. - Number one negative line ready. Number two positive line ready. - Number two positive line ready. Number two negative line ready. - Number two negative line ready. Carry up, one, two, now! Number four negative line ready. Stop the target with the helicopter. Yes, sir. Pull back! Pull back! Pull back! Pull back! Pull back! Pull back! Pullback! Pull back! Retreat! Retreat! Retreat! - Ready? - Ready. - Ready? - Ready. The Maser operation area setup completed. Electricity discharge area setup completed. - Fire! - Firel Okay, move! We've succeeded! Mobile Headquarters, Mobile Headquarters. Damn it ... you see? - Prepare to discharge electricity. - Discharge! All right! - Hey! - Oh! Get down! Headquarters! Calling Headquarters. Another larger Frankenstein has emerged, and has helped the target to go into the north mountain. There've been two from the beginning. Professor, that's the Frankenstein that grew up in the laboratory. He was on the mountain as you thought. If there are two Frankensteins, this one has done nothing wrong. From the Minister of Defense ... From the Minister of Defense ... From now on, sea Frankenstein will be called Gailah, and mountain Frankenstein, Sanda. How was sea Gailah born? Or has he crossed the ocean? Look at these trees. It's incredible. They were knocked down like matchsticks or toothpicks. Why did Sanda come to help. I wonder if they are related. Stop asking why and start searching for clues. If we get cells, we'll soon find out. Professor. Yuzo. Great job. Is it Sanda's? Hello. Good to see you. Good to see you. Have you found the Gargantuas? No, not yet. Captain. If I may, the clue to finding where they are hiding lies with Gailah rather than Sanda. Gailah cannot live without water. Is that so? I see. Thank you for your advice. - Call the commander. - Yes, sir. From the search party to Headquarters ... We must find Gailah's cells somehow. Let's go. - See you then. - Yes. Professor. Is it Gailah's? It looks like his tissues. The cells are identical. This proves that these two Frankensteins are brothers. Brothers? Yes, they probably are. As you knew. Sanda went to Lake Biwa after running away from the laboratory. A piece of his flesh tore off on a rock, and this flesh could have made its way to the ocean. It grew by feeding on protein-rich plankton. It may sound weird, but these two Frankensteins are not exactly father and son, nor brothers. If you want to be precise, it's more like cloning. Professor, if that's true ... ...if pieces of flesh have been scattered about by bombing, then countless Frankensteins will emerge. If it's true, all mankind could be destroyed. We were going to use a converging attack, but we have to revise our strategy. We can use napalm. Even if we don't hit them directly, we can suffocate them without breaking them to pieces. Yoo hoo. Yoo hoo. The mountain, we chased hares The river we fished Dreams are still alive Hometown cannot be forgotten Are you well, mother and father? Aren't they afraid of Gailah? They are young, and are not afraid of anything. It is the same in every country. Youth can come alive, any time, anywhere. When the Nazis occupied Paris, movie theaters and cafes were filled with young people. We can't say that about others. I'm not doing anything wrong, and neither are they. Just because there are fewer fish in the lake, tourists cannot be restricted. It causes a headache for the Self Defense Force. Shall we walk? Let's enjoy while the sun is out. I won't be responsible if Gailah shows up. I will fulfill my dream someday. And I will return Mountains are green in my hometown. Waters are pure in my hometown. Let's sing again. The mountain we chased hares. The river we fished. Dreams are still alive. The mist is getting thicker. Yes. We should return now. Hometown cannot be forgotten Run! Run! Wait! Wait! Wait! What's wrong? Gargantua! Let's go back to the car. Run, quick! Watch your step, but hurry! Akemil Help! Akemi, hold on tight. I will come and help you. Professor! Professor! Akemil Akemil Hold on tight! I'm almost there. Are you all right? You remember me. Wait! Wait! Wait! MOBILE HEADQUARTERS Sanda saved me because he remembers me. He hasn't changed. It must be Gailah who attacked the boat. At dawn, we will discharge electricity into the lake, and burn the forest with napalm. With Sanda? We cannot allow them to run lose any longer. Headquarters, Headquarters! Garguanta's present position is 2 kilometers northwest of point 17, Highway 130. He is headed south. What should we do? They've outsmarted us again. Carry out our orders. All units: Destroy the Gargantuas with all effort. When attacking, select the areas which present the least potential for damage to lives and property. Wait a minute. What if the cells scatter? If that happens, we will mobilize chemical weapons to eliminate them completely. All retreat! Retreat! Retreat! According to the report, the Gargantua is not afraid of fire. Rather, he is approaching. That must be Sanda. Captain, Sanda is innocent. He broke his leg trying to save Akemi. That is Gailah we are seeing now. He is trying to get back to the ocean. I agree with you; there is no mistake. All right. All units move quickly to the coastline. Deploy! It is not a theory that Sanda is a harmless creature. It's a fact. It's a proven fact. It is my opinion that he should be kept alive for the purpose of scientific research. I disagree with the Professor. If Gailah is Sanda's brother, we can't tell whether Sanda would become violent. We should take every measure to exterminate them now. If we attack them, Sanda and Gailah will be blown to pieces. Their cells would be scattered not only over Tokyo, but all of Japan. Then countless Sandas and Gailahs would emerge. Aren't they already breaking up by themselves? That's why I'm proposing that at least Sanda should be confined in a secure place. Then, under this desirable environment, we can continue the scientific research. If we can at least raise Sanda ... Can you raise him? I'm sure Akemi can. If you can keep him under complete control, I can make a proposal to the UN Scientific Council. It doesn't have to be in Japan. There are many deserted areas with an ideal climate in Siberia or Canada. Professor, thank you. We must find Sanda as soon as possible. They are created from same cells, but one lives in the sea, and the other lives in the mountains. I wonder why. Sand should be in this area. Start the search here. Is it Gailah? Good heavens! Professor, they are turning on the lights. Let's call Yuzo. Hello, hello, This is Dr.Stewart Connect me to the Ministry of Defense. Hurry! Okay, I understand. - Commander. - Yes. People aren't turning off their lights as soon as the siren sounds. I see. He thinks there is food where there is light. Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights! What's happening? - Turn off your lights! - Yes. Hurry! Hurry! Help me. Evacuate quickly. You can't pass through here. Hurry! Please get off here immediately. Why are you stopping here? You can't go any further. Just get off! Turn off your headlights! Don't wait. The car won't move. Get out and walk. Damn it! Just got this car a month ago. What do you mean, we can't use the car? I can't open the door! Let's hurry. Hurry up. If you cut off the city's power supply, and turn the searchlight from sea ... ...we might be able to lead him out to sea. Hundreds of thousands of people are evacuating. We can't cut the power supply to trains and subways. What? Sanda came out? Where is he now? He has destroyed Kuri Bridge and headed south. Do you still insist on keeping him alive? Hello. What, Sanda came to Tokyo? No, I can't believe he is trying to help Gailah. Professor! Hello. It's Dr. Stewart. There is nothing we can do; Sanda is approaching Tokyo. I understand. I will go to Headquarters right away. Akemi. Where are you going? I will send him back to the mountains. No, it's too late. No it's not. It's my turn to save him. Akemil Akemil Stop! Go over there, over there. Yes, yes. I understand. Akemil Poor girl. Let's go back. I know you are determined to save him, aren't you? Yes. I understand. Okay, I will go with you. But Sanda is very agitated now. We will start the attack shortly. Defense Forces units and those of you still in danger, evacuate into subway stations. We will start the attack shortly. Defense Forces units and those of you still in danger, evacuate into subway stations. Professor! That's Gailah. Let's get into the subway station now. Squadron, pull back to the assigned position. Squadron, pull back to the assigned position. This way. Sandal Akemil Akemil Akemil Akemil Are you all right? Medical unit, come here. Yes. Sir. All soldiers, come to the platform. - Get the stretcher. - Yes, sir. Akemi. Akemi. Akemi. Professor. Are you all right? Yes. I'm glad. I thought I'd lost the most important person. You were right. Sanda came here to fight with Gailah. Commander, can't you give Sanda an hour or even just thirty minutes? I'm sure Sanda will defeat Gailah. What happens if Gailah wins? Commander, please give Sanda a chance. He saved Akemi twice. What happens if both get away? One minute to the attack. Hell, hello. Professor. I am sorry. I tried everything, but nothing helped. The only thing left to do is to gather cells for research. Yes. Understood. The battleground is moving to the coastline. What kind of Gargantuas are they that we can't destroy them with this much firepower? Forward. Forward. Forward. Stop! Professor. Haven't found them yet? A helicopter is searching over Tokyo Bay, but they haven't found them. They must have gone to the open sea. The undersea volcano's eruption is becoming increasingly violent. We will leave you from the field now. How are you feeling? It's one hell of an eruption. I don't think either Sanda or Gailah have survived. Has it been confirmed? No. The heat is so intense, even the helicopter cannot get close. END
