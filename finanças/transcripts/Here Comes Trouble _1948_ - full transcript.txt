[MUSIC PLAYING] -Mr. Blake, your campaign against the underworld is finally getting some results. -Yeah? -Rankin and Spinelli want to see you this afternoon. -Oh, good. Call Martin Stafford and have him come over. I want my lawyer here when I talk to those crooks. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Come in. -Get yourself another police reporter, boss. I'm leaving. -Don't tell me they've scared you off too. -I didn't get this from fright. And when I came to, this was stuffed in my hand, "Get out of town." I'm taking the hint. -There goes our fourth police reporter in six months. -I'll show them they can't intimidate me. That's all, Dexter. -Oh, your daughter called. -Yeah? -She asked me to tell you not to forget that Doubleday is reporting back to work today. -Forget it? That's all I've heard about at home, ever since he wrote her he was getting out of the Army. -She also said to remind you about giving him that promotion. -It's beyond me. She could have her pick of dozens of fine young man in her own social set, but no. She has to throw herself away on a insignificant copy boy like Doubleday. -That's what's known as love. -You mean insanity. If I don't promote him, I'll get no peace at home. I'll promote him, Dexter. We need a new police reporter. -Take it easy, chief. That's a pretty rough assignment for a nice kid like Doubleday. Why that mob would run him out of town in a couple of days. -That's what I say, Dexter. We've got a new police reporter. -Oh, you don't know how swell it is being home and seeing you again and having my old job on the paper waiting for me. -I've got a surprise for you. You're not going back to any old job as a copy boy. Why, we could never get married on that salary. I made Daddy promise to give you a promotion. -Oh, you shouldn't have done that. Businessmen resent that sort of thing. He's-- he's doing enough just taking me back. -I love you for being so modest, but that's not the right approach with Daddy. The way to impress him is to assert yourself. -I don't know, but I'll try. -Remember that snapshot you sent me from Naiti? -Oh. One of the boys asked me to pose for it. -Well, I-- I had it enlarged and framed for you to-- to give to Daddy as a present when you report. -Pretty big, isn't it? I-- I appreciate you doing it, Penny, but wh-- what's your father going to think when I give that to him? -Don't you worry about that. It's part of my plan to remind him you're back on the job. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] -Well, well, if it isn't Doubleday, the wonder boy, goes to war a mouse, comes home a wolf. Hey, sister? Oh, hello, Miss Blake. -Goodbye. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, Dodo, you forgot your present for Daddy. [MUSIC PLAYING] -To our readers, I make this pledge, vice must go. Uh, to the underworld, I say this-- [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Come in-- you cannot intimidate me. I mean this fight to the finish. I'm not afraid of-- [ARMY MUSIC] -Do you like it, Mr. Blake? -What is it? -Why, it's me, sir. A little present for you as a token of my appreciation for taking me back on the paper. -[CHUCKLES] Well, thanks. Uh, it actually-- er, uh, take care of this. It'll be a pleasure to hang Doubleday. Son, you've come back just in time to do this paper a great service. -I have? -Boy, I need help in my campaign to clean up this city. I need a man with brains, courage, resourcefulness. -You do? -Look at this beautiful town of ours being undermined by organized crime. The man that ferrets it out will be our public hero number one. That's the chance I'm giving you. -Me? -That's your new assignment. I'm promoting you to police reporter. -Police reporter. Oh, thank you, sir. --[CHUCKLES] And the sooner you let that gang of hoodlums down there know that you're on the job, the better I'm gonna like it. -Wh-- wh-- when do I start? -Right away. Go down to police headquarters and see what you can dig up. -Yes, sir! -Well, come on. Hop to it. -Oh. Well, goodbye. -Goodbye. -And good luck. -Oh, thank you, Miss Dexter. And thank you, sir, for this wonderful opportunity. -Don't come back until you've got some real evidence. Understand? -Yes, sir. -Here. --[EMBARRASSED LAUGH] Goodbye, sir. -Goodbye. [LAUGHS] Well, I think that's the last we'll see of Doubleday. [CHUCKLES] Wh-- [ARMY MUSIC] -Dexter, remind me to cut your salary. -Hey, fellas. I've just been promoted. I'm a full-fledged reporter now. -Congratulations. Gee, Doubleday, that's swell. -Oh. -Nice going, kid. -Well, thanks a lot, gang, but I have to report at police headquarters right away. -Wait-- wa-- wait a minute. That hat. -Oh, it's brand new. Don't you like it? -That's what I mean. There, that's better. -I thought it looked pretty good on me. -Yeah. Now you're beginning to look like a reporter. -Oh, thanks. You really think so? -Certainly do. -That tie, I don't like it. -Too loud? -Nope, too long. Besides, all cub reporters wear old ties. -They do? -Yeah! -[SQUEAKY COUGH] -And all reporters smoke cigars. These are for the boys down at the station. Put ya in solid. And this is for you. Now you look like the real McCoy. --[COUGHING] Thanks a lot, everybody, but now I really must be going. -Just a minute. Freddy's gotta take your picture first. -M-- my picture? W-- what for? -For the front page tomorrow. You know, "Copy Boy Makes Good. Doubleday Becomes Reporter, Make a Big Splash." You know what I mean? -Gee. -Uh, now, uh, let's have a look. Hold it right there for a minute. Ah, that's right. Now we can, uh, correct the wrinkles, you see? And, uh, fix up that, uh, that shiny nose. Uh, this is a new color technique. We touch up the subject before we take the picture. Camera about ready, Freddie? -Coming right up, and loaded for color. -Well, how's it look? -Fine. -Well, come on. The man's in a hurry. -Now, Doubleday, old boy, give us a nice, careless, nonchalant sort of a pose, you know, like you'd scooped the whole town with a big yarn. Give out with that personality. You know how it is? That's perfect. That's terrific. Now, hold it. Hold it. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Here! Hold this! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ames! -Well, my aching back. -Why you [INAUDIBLE]. You're the first of the old outfit I've seen since we split up at Tokyo. -Well, if it ain't the old sad sack of Company B. What are you doing here? -Oh, I'm the new police reporter for "The Tribune." Mr. Blake sent me to get evidence to help us campaign against the underworld. -I'm afraid you're a little late, kid. After that haul I made today, I don't think there's a gangster loose in town. Got the whole mob in there awaiting trial. My first day in uniform too. -Gee, that's swell, Ames. It'll be great news for Mr. Blake too. He was pretty concerned about conditions here. -And he should be, with a lot of crooks running around posing as respectable citizens. -Well, how'd you know they were criminals? -Oh, just by looking at 'em. A cop can always tell. But come on in. This'll give you a great story for your paper. Sit down right here. Hi ya, Chief. Greetings, Your Honor. Officer-- Officer Ames reporting, sir. -Would you kindly take the stand? -Who, me? -Yes, you. -Well, gee. Thanks. -Ah, this whole thing is a farce. Look at this. Arresting a man for kissing his wife in public. Booking a prominent doctor as a second-story man, because he can't tell the difference between burglar tools and surgical instruments. You haven't got a case here that'll hold water. You're all dismissed, with the apologies of the court. -You mean you turned them all loose? -Hey, wait a minute. Here. Your Honor, I caught this guy red-handed fishing without a license. It's in the bag here, Exhibits A, B, C, D, and E. -Is that right? -That's right, Your Honor. I never gave it a thought. -Well, unfortunately, ignorance of the law is no excuse. I'm going to have to fine you. -Oh, but Your Honor, you can't. -I can't? -The officer shouldn't have arrested him in the first place. -You keep out of this. -But Ames, those are Semotilus atromaculatus. -Hm? -Hm? -They are? -I would have sworn them was fish. -Oh, they're fish all right, Ames. Semotilus atromaculatus is their scientific name. -Oh. -They're commonly known as the chub, a scavenger fish. And no license has ever been required to catch them. -You're right, absolutely right. I'd forgotten what chub looked like. Caught a lot of them when I was a boy. Ah, happy, carefree days with a willow pole, barefoot lad with cheek of tan. [CLEARS THROAT] Case dismissed. -Well, thank you, Your Honor. -Ah, thank you, young man. Court's adjourned. -You just couldn't keep your big mouth shut, could ya? -But Ames, the-- the man was innocent. Here, have a cigar. Have another. One more? -Don't try to soft soap me. -Ames! -I'm sorry, Chief. Don't worry. I'll see that Doubleday don't put nothing in the paper. And that's a promise. Oh. Have a cigar, Chief. You too, Judge. Uh, I, uh, never smoke on duty. -Somebody get these astronomical chubatellises outta here. -Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Yes, sir. [BANG] [MUSIC PLAYING] -You're a lawyer, Stafford. Isn't Mr. Blake getting pretty close to liable, attacking my client like this? Yeah. What's the idea always picking on me? All I do is run a legitimate burlesque house. -(SCOFFS) Legitimate. That place of yours is just a front for all the racketeers in this town, gamblers, con men, blackmailers, crooks of every description. -That does it, Blake. I'll sue you. -Go right ahead, Rankin. As Mr. Blake's attorney, nothing would suit me better than to get you on a witness stand. Then we might uncover the identity of the real man behind these rackets, your real boss. -That's the fellow I'm after. -And don't think your cheap threats will stop Mr. Blake. He doesn't scare worth a cent. -You know, that's a funny thing. I don't either. Come on. -I wanna see Doubleday. Don't tell me he ain't here, because I checked at the paper. -He's here. This way. -Uh, just a moment. Let me surprise him. Huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] -[SQUEAKY NOISES] -Shut up! -[SQUEAKY NOISE] -Shut up! I'll do the talking. Now get this straight, sport. Everything that happened in police court today, forget it. Because if one word gets in the newspaper, I'll unscrew your head and use it for a door knob. -Sure, Ames. I-- I don't want to get you into any trouble. Oh, uh, Penny, this is Mr. Ames, an old Army pal of mine. This is Miss Blake. -Oh. How do you do? I'm sure. -I'm happy to know you. -Yeah, um, likewise. -Hello? I'm sorry. Mr. Blake isn't here at the moment. Any message? -Well, Mrs. Blake, you tell Mr. Blake we're through warning him about his campaign to clean up this town, so the boss is sending somebody over to pound a little sense into his thick head. -Oh! Oh! Ah! -Mother! Oh, Mother! [MUSIC PLAYING] -So I'm to go to his office in the morning and warn him to lay off, or uh, I go to his wife and tell her about the little episode at the convention in Chicago, right? -Right. And you'd better make it stick. -Mother? Mother? [MUSIC PLAYING] -You. You brute. You brute! What have you done with my husband? You gangster! -Lady, please! -Mother. Mother. What are you doing? This is Mr. Ames, a friend of Dodos. Oh. -We're buddies. -Oh, I'm sorry. Um, how do you do? -Oh. How do you do? -We've got to find Father to warn him. They're after him. -What? Who's after him? -Racketeers. -Racketeers? -Yes. They're coming over here to knock Father's head off or something. -Oh, no. -Well, don't just stand here. Somebody call the police. -Yeah. That's a good idea. Police department, and snap it up. What am I doing? Now relax, all of you. Not a thing to worry about. I'll take charge here. Now you ladies go right in and sit down and leave everything to me. -Ames, maybe we should call the police. -Huh? -For a little help, I mean. -Help? And let somebody else hog all the credit? Look, champ, this is my big chance. And what a scoop for you, "Officer Ames Outwits Underworld, Saves Publisher's Life Single-handed." -I know, Ames. But maybe we don't-- -But nothing. Have you forgotten who was the Judo champ of our regiment? I'll give him this, and then some of this. Then I'll-- [MUSIC PLAYING] -Gee, kid. I'm sorry. But that'll give you a rough idea of what's going to happen to anybody who comes around here looking for trouble tonight. -Dodo? What's the mess here? -Oh, just a little something we used to do together in the Army. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR BUZZER] -You all get in the other room. I don't want anybody hurt, in case there's any shooting. Looking for trouble, buddy? -Well, who-- who-- -Don't. -[CHOKING NOISES] -Yeah. Well, it's me, big boy. Oh, wanna play, huh? -Oh! -Look, gangster, go back and tell your mob I swallow a dozen tough guys like you every morning, on the half shell. I guarantee you, that ape will never bother anybody anymore. -Oh, thank you, officer. And when Mr. Blake hears about this, he'll want to thank you too. -Was he really a gangster? -Gangster. Toughest looking gorilla I ever laid eyes on, you know, one of them low-browed characters with little pig eyes and a jaw like a baboon, lowest looking crook-- oh, so you've come back for more, huh? Now give me room, folks, and I'll-- -Winfield! -Why, Mr. Blake. -Mr. Blake? You? -Yeah, me, toughest looking gorilla you ever saw, little pig eyes, a jaw like a baboon! [ALL TALKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MR. BLAKE: Jaws like a baboon, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Winfield! -No! Let me at that guy! -You're so crazy. -You're making a terrible mistake, sir. Ames and I went through the war together. We're buddies. -Yeah, you're buddies. You're-- buddies, huh? Buddies, huh? -Winfield -Oh, Mother. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Doubleday, you're fired! Don't you ever let me see you with my daughter again. Get in there, Mother. Go on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Dodo? Oh, Dodo, what are we going to do? I've never seen Daddy so furious. You've just got to do something. -Penny, there's nothing I can do. Now you go down in the office in the morning and make him understand. -Office? He-- he wouldn't even let me near the building. Didn't you hear what he said? -Well-- well, maybe if you got there before he did. -That's right, kid. He can't kick you out, if you're already in. -It'll only make him madder, Penny. -It's the only way, Dodo. For me, darling? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, Mr. Blake isn't in yet. Won't you have a seat? -Thank you, I will. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Now, Mr. Blake. Now see here, Mister-- [MUSIC PLAYING] -[WHISTLING HAPPILY] -Oh, wait a minute, there's somebody in the-- -Dexter, my troubles are over. Doubleday is no longer with us. -The mob gave him the works already? -(HAPPILY) No, me. I fired him last night. [HUMMING A HAPPY JIG] [WOLF WHISTLE] -Hello, Windy. -I beg your pardon? [CLEARS THROAT] [COUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] And what can I do for you? BUBBLES LARUE: Oh, don't tell me you've forgotten. [LAUGHS] Beginning to remember? -Uh, B-- Baubles-- uh, B-- Bubbles LaRue. [LAUGHS] Chicago, wasn't it? -What a convention. MR. BLAKE: Oh, you said it. [LAUGHS] You said it. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, eh, wh-- what-- what are you doing in town? -Oh, same old thing, Burley Q. -All right. -I just opened at the International. -Oh. -One of the theaters you're trying to close. -Ah. Don't tell me. Let me add it up. The local mob sent you here TO put the squeeze on me. -Well, that's their idea, but I think you and I can work out our own little deal. What would you pay to get the lowdown on this mob? Double cross 'em, huh? -Oh, don't be so crude. Let's just call it collecting my old age pension. --[SIGHS] What's your proposition? -Well, it's all here in my diary, the name of the big boss and enough evidence to hang him, also, a complete account of our little escapade in Chicago. Take a squint. -[CLEARS THROAT] How much? -Ten grand. That's a bargain. -Sold. -Now here's the proposition. Have someone in my dressing room at 3 o'clock. Let them slip me the dough, and I'll hand over the diary. And then, have him hit me over the head and knock me stiff. MR. BLAKE: Hey, what is this? BUBBLES LARUE: It's got to look like somebody robbed me, or no dice. If the boys ever got the idea that I sold out-- no, I've gotta be caught cold, or no fooling. -Hello, Miss Dexter. -Oh, Mrs. Blake. (LOUDLY) Oh, it's you, Mrs. Blake. Oh, what a divine hat, Mrs. Blake. MRS. BLAKE: Well, I'm glad you like it. -Oh, please, Mrs. Blake, don't go in yet. [CONVERSATION CONTINUES] -Well, I'm sure he won't mind. -Oh, but Mrs. Blake, I-- please, Mrs. Blake-- MRS. BLAKE: I'll only be a minute. -Oh. Hello, Martha. Nice of you to pop in. But really, I'm up to my-- I mean, I'm-- I'm terribly busy, uh, the campaign. You understand. -(SCOFFS) Campaign. It has Miss Dexter terribly upset. And you? Why you're as jumpy as a-- as a jack rabbit. -Eh, Martha, some other time. I-- -And the dreadful way you treated poor Dorian last night. MR. BLAKE: Oh. MRS. BLAKE: That's what I came in here to talk to you about. -Now don't start that again. I've got enough trouble-- -Oh! -Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait-- -Now look what you've done. -Wait. Wa-- wait a minute. Here. Here, use this. Use this. -No, no. I'll use the wash room. -Oh, no! Ma-- Martha! Martha! Wait a minute! No. No. Come here. Give me-- here-- oh-- -Winfield! -Wait. Wait. -Don't give me a pitcher of-- -Martha! MRS. BLAKE: Oh! -Martha! Oh! -Oh, excuse me. Well. A little accident. Thank you. I must say, it's a surprise finding you here, but I'm glad it happened this way. Now we three can sit down and talk this over calmly. Did you, uh, get everything fixed up with Mr. Blake? -(WHISPERS) Not yet. -Well, that's all right. You leave it to me. Come on. -Martha, I can explain. It was-- -Winfield? Why didn't you tell me Dorian was here? -Well, I-- I-- I would-- I-- I would if I-- if I'd-- if I'd-- I would if I'd seen-- if I'd seen that you wanted to know-- I mean, if I'd known that you want-- wanted to see him, I-- I-- -But dear, that's the reason I'm here today, so we can settle this misunderstanding. -Misunderstanding? -Yes. -What misunderstanding? Why Doubleday knows I was only joking last night, don't you son? Yeah. -I could have been mistaken, sir. But somehow, I did get the impression that I was fired. -Fired? Whatever gave you that idea? Why, you're getting another raise. We can't afford to have our future son-in-law working for peanuts. -Well, Winfield, this is all very confusing. But anyway, I'm delighted. And Penny will be so happy. Why, the poor girl was just about frantic. -Oh, I'll see you out, Mrs. Blake. -Yes. Yes. Yes. So hurry along. You-- you'll miss the elevator. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] And come right back, Doubleday. That, uh, new-- new assignment, you know? -Yes, sir. -You can come on now, Bubbles. Uh, uh, how-- how-- how come she didn't see you? -That pixie of yours pushed me into the shower. Who is that guy, anyway? -Oh, never mind him. We've got to get you out of here. 3 o'clock in your dressing room, I'll have somebody there with the cash. -Where's my coat? -Oh. Oh, that's-- that's I threw it out the window. -You what? -Well, I'll buy-- I'll buy you a new one. I'll-- -Oh, for land's sake, how does a girl get out of here like this? -Oh yeah, that's right. Wait a minute. Let's go-- uh, here. Here. Here, take this one. Hurry up. Get it on and get out of here. No! No, not that way. Not that way. Here. -Shall I see her to the elevator too? -I got her out of here. -Gee, that diary sounds like a real clue. Are you going down to the theater and get it? -No, you are. -Boy, what a scoop. Here, have a cigar. -Now, calm down. This is serious. Go down to Stafford's office, and he'll give you the money. I'll phone him and explain. -Yes, sir. -Now, just a minute. Don't forget. After you get the diary, you've got to knock her out. -Oh, but I couldn't. I've never hit a lady before. -All right. If you won't do it, you will never see my daughter again. -Oh, I'll-- I'll do it, sir. But where will I hit her? -Well, I'd hit her, uh-- here. Hit her about there. -Like this? -Oh! Not so hard. That would kill her. Ju-- just a tap. Now come on, get going. I'll met you outside the theater. Uh, remember now, son, not a word of this to anybody. -Oh no, sir. My lips are sealed. -Fine. Fine. What are you guys gawking at? Come on, get to work. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BANG] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, there he is. -Dodo, what happened? Wouldn't Daddy listen to reason? -Uh, I'll explain later, Penny. Excuse us a minute. -Huh? Oh sure, kid. Here you are. -Thanks. -Dodo, you're not gonna hit Father. -Oh, no. Of course not. It's just a little private matter I've got to straighten up before you and I can get married. I'll see you later. -What was all the whispering about? -Oh-- oh, nothing much. He's just got to go down to the International and interview a-- a burlesque queen by the name of Bubbles LaRue. -Interview her with a blackjack? -Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Now, wait a minute. That don't make sense. What's he up to with my blackjack? -What's he up to with that Bubbles LaRue? -Yeah. -Hm. So that's the little matter he has to straighten out before we can get married. Come on. Let's go down there. -Yeah. The stairs are quicker. Ah! -Well, Doubleday, this is a pretty important assignment for a new reporter. You should be mighty proud of Mr. Blake's conference in you. -Well, it's really nothing. Everything's arranged. I just have to get the diary from Miss LaRue. -Diary? Oh, uh, diary. Yes, of course. Well good luck, son. -Thank you, sir. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMAN SCREAMS] -Excuse me! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, son. The chorus kids are at the end of the hall. -Oh, nothing like that, sir. I have sort of an appointment with Miss LaRue. -Two doors down. But she's on now. [SNEEZE] She's picking 'em kinda young this season. -Oh. Oh, this isn't a social call, sir. Strictly business. [SNEEZE] [SNEEZE] [SNEEZE] [SNEEZE] -Would you like some water, sir? [SNEEZE] [SNEEZE] [SNEEZE] [SNEEZE] [SNEEZE] Hay fever. I've had it for years. I don't know what I'd do without little Bertha here. She's the only thing that can stop me, once I get to sneezing. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Pixie. -Uh, Mr. Blake said-- -Shh! No names. (QUIETLY) Did you bring it with you? -(QUIETLY) Oh, yes. Right here. -The dough, you dope. The dough. -Oh. Yes, ma'am. That's-- that's in here too. -OK, wait a minute. I've got to stage. This has to look good. Who's there? [KNOCK ON DOOR] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [SCREAM] [THUD] [RATTLING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Oh, Miss LaRue? I've got that new number for you. Miss LaRue! What's the matter? Are you sick? Oh, no! [SCREAM] -Miss LaRue? Miss LaRue? Miss LaRue, is it all right to-- why-- why, Miss LaRue. I didn't do it! Honest! [POP] [SCREAM] [SIRENS] -Yeah, you three cover the front here. Blare, you and Holden go around the alley and cover there. You two cover the door around the side. Well, how are you, Mr. Blake? -Well, hello, Steve. How are ya? -What are you, on a slumming tour? Or are you a patron of the fine arts? -No, I was just down the way to a business appointment. You know, I was, uh, uh, uh-- my campaign, you know? [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Uh, what's all the excitement? What's up? -From here, it looks like murder. -Mu-- murder? Who-- who murdered who? -Let's go inside. We'll find out. -Oh, no. I've got-- -Come on. Come on. There may be a story in this for you. So one thing's certain. No professional would leave his calling card. Obviously, the work of an amateur. -Amateur? It's the work of a moron, if you ask me. -Did you? Did you? -Gee, thanks sir, for not telling about my appointment with Miss LaRue. I would have been kind of awkward if they suspected me. -That's all right, son. Think nothing of it. -I may be able to solve this crime. You see, I know why she was killed. Why, I may be able to put my finger on the murderer any minute. -Hi, Chief. What's cooking? -Ames, I thought I assigned you to the hock shop detail. What are you doing here? -Well, it was like this. I was tailing somebody, and what do you know? He leads me right to this show. -You don't say. -Yeah. And what a show. Say, that Bubbles LaRue, she's out of this world. -Ames, you're right for the first time since you've joined the force. DORIAN: Why, Penny. MR. BLAKE: Penny? What in the world-- -Daddy, what are you doing here? -Get out of here. Go on home. -Hold on. Not so fast, Miss Blake. What do you know about Bubbles LaRue? -I prefer not to discuss Miss LaRue. Oh, Daddy, I've been so wrong about Dodo. -Why Penny, you don't think I came here to-- -I don't think anything, Mr. Doubleday, I know why you came here. -Penny, shut up. S-- something terrible has happened. Miss LaRue was-- has been murdered. -Oh, Dodo. -Oh, Penny. No. -So you had a date with Miss LaRue. But you're in love with Miss Blake. Don't deny it. You want to marry her, but Miss LaRue was in your way. She was jealous of you. She had your love letters in that trunk. -I-- -And she [INAUDIBLE] like a rat. You hid in that closet. And when you saw your chance, you sprang out. You knocked her to the floor and killed her. Come on now, admit it. Speak up! -I've been trying to, sir. -Now we're beginning to get somewhere. Come on, Harris, take down his confession. I know how to make him crack. Well, let's have the whole story. Why did you kill her? -I didn't. And if you'll pardon my saying so, sir, the modern criminologist would consider your methods extremely unscientific. -You don't say so. -Oh yes, sir. The new technique is to reconstruct the crime from the material evidence on the scene. For instance, this coat. As you see, sir, it's a man's coat. Obviously, it belongs to a large man, someone about the size of, well, um, Mr. Blake, for instance. -Well, Blake, when you get through gargling, maybe you'll tell me why you came down here today. -I-- I told you. I had a-- I had a business appointment. -Well, you won't mind slipping into Exhibit 2, just to see how it fits. Well, well, what a coincidence. Fits you like a glove. -Just like the skin on a baby hippo. -Now ain't that misfortunate? Davis, I want you to fingerprint everybody in this room. -OK. -And we'll start with you, Mr. Blake. I want to compare prints. -Come on, Blake. -This is an outrage. It's unconstitutional. -Bite your tongue. Come over here. -I haven't done anything wrong. -I know. I know. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Do you want your atomizer, Mr. Bagsy? [MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Bagsy! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Not so fast. -You did it. You got the diary. -You're right. [SCREAM] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Relax! I was just leaving. And I can assure you, one false move would be too bad for this young lady. Get going. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Excuse me. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you.
