Oh, dear God.. Who is this? - That's some loser. Oh, he's alive! Come, let's go. Hey, someone has shot him. There are no wounds on his body. There's so much blood. What are you doing? I'll post this on Facebook. Let's go. We're running late. It's an emergency. Is the doctor available? What happened? Someone has shot him. I found him lying on the road. There's no doctor available on the first floor. Try dialling four from the second floor. Hurry up, please. Hello, Doctor. There's a trauma case. No, Doctor. It looks like a police case. Someone has brought him. Okay, Doctor. Sorry, sir. The doctor is in an emergency operation. He's very busy. Please take the patient to a government hospital. He spoke to you during an operation, is it? Excuse me, sir.. - Sir, where are you going? Doctor.. - Hey, who the hell are you, man? Doctor, it's an emergency. Please come. The patient is downstairs. Please attend to him quickly. - Hey.. Who are you? How dare you order me? Get out! - The patient's critical, please.. Oh, then take him somewhere else.. Go.. Doctor, there's a bullet in his vascular organ. He's bleeding heavily. - Vascular.. Are you a medical student? Don't act stupid. You're going to become a doctor. What does a bullet wound signify? It's a police case. Such cases should be taken to a government hospital. Learn that first. Get out.. - Please understand. We're running out of time. Come fast, Doctor, please. Didn't you hear me? - What you're doing is wrong. It's a crime. According to law, you're supposed to attend the patient who's in a critical condition. Don't you know that.. - Are you teaching me the law? My foot, get out, dammit! Get out! I said, get lost! He's a lamb. - Shut up. It's my house. I get to call the shots. You do that too.. Sir, is there a station, nearby? - What happened? I found him on 4th Avenue. He's been shot. I took him to a private hospital. They told me to inform the cops and admit him in a government hospital. So.. Murugesh! - What happened? Sir.. - Where are you from? How do you know this guy? - I don't know him. I found him, when I was travelling back from a friend's place. Which friend did you go to meet at this late night? I went to study. I have an exam tomorrow morning.. - Fine, what's your name? Sir, he's in a critical condition. He needs to undergo an operation immediately. Please help me or file a complaint. What are you saying? - Sir, he's struggling.. Murugesh, this is a big case. Call up the inspector. Sir, his watch is missing. - What are you saying? What's your name? - My name is Chandru. Please call the inspector. I'll speak with him. He's gone on his rounds. He's not available to talk. What do I do now, sir? Wait for half an hour. The inspector will be here. Half an hour.. This man is fighting for his life! Murugesh.. - What happened? I left the key here. Did you see it? The key.. No.. Search properly. - I kept it right here. Where did I keep it.. Maybe I left it in the pocket.. Check in the pockets of your pants. No, I won't find it there. Hey! Sir.. Sir.. Come on! Mister, please help me! Mister, please hold him. Mister.. Mister, I'm talking to you! Thank you. Take this. You're a doctor.. You're a doctor.. Doctor.. Doctor.. Chandru, is it you? - Yes, Sister-in-law. I'm not hungry. Please sleep. When is the exam? - At 10:30 a.m. The phone's been ringing for so long, dear. Who's calling? Hello.. Who is it? Why are you calling at this time? Doctor, I made a mistake.. - What's the matter? What are you saying? Doctor, I've kept everything ready. But I don't know how to operate on him. What have you done? You've committed a crime. If this matter gets out, you know what will happen. Do you know what it would do to your family? Idiot. Such a fool. I can't believe I trained you.. Doctor.. - Hang up! 'Consumption of drugs is injurious to health.' Doctor! - Chandru, what's his white blood cells count? How much? Okay, is there any evidence of a head injury? Fine, tell me exactly where the entry wound is. Oh, left 10th intercostal space. Anterior Axle. Fine. Now tell me where the exit wound is. Fine. Where's the guarding? The bullet has entered, but it didn't come out. The guarding is in the epigastrium. The bullet has to be in the spleen. We have to remove the spleen. Chandru, you have to perform an operate. You have to perform a splenectomy. How are you going to perform the haemostasis? Fine, do you have a soldering iron at home? Uncle.. - What? Sister is here. I'm on an emergency call. I don't want to be disturbed for the next 90 minutes. Okay? Go. Chandru.. Put me on the loudspeaker. Listen to me. We have to anaesthetise the patient. Chandru, tell me frankly. Do you consume drugs? No, Doctor.. I.. Come on, man. Speak out. If so, you're lucky. Doctor, it's my final semester. So, sometimes.. - Cut the crap, man. Tell me what do you have. Great! - Doctor.. Give him a shot of ATMG Stat! Doctor.. - We don't know the fluid volume. The drug maintains cardiac output. Give it to him. Chandru, you're not a medical student, anymore. You're a doctor. A real doctor. You're going to operate him now. You're going to be successful. You're going to save a life. Believe in yourself. Let's begin. He's stabilising, Doctor. God bless him. And God bless you, Chandru. Chandru, I'll talk to you in the morning. Goodnight. Chandru, wake up. You're going to be late for your exam. Wake up, Chandru. Hey, why did you leave the door open before sleeping? Why are the tables arranged like this? Hey, what happened? Thanks. "This is the end." "Hold your breath and count.." "Feel the Earth moving.." Hello, ma'am. Is your husband here? Yes, who are you? - We're here to meet Mr. Bhaskar. Please come. - Thank you. Mr. Bhaskar. - Yes. I'm Lal. How can I help you? - Shall we sit and talk? Take your seat. Do you recognise this man, Mr. Bhaskar? Excuse me, who are you? What do you want? What about you? Have you seen him? No. Sir, who are you? What do you want? We're from CBCID, sir. Last night, around 11:00 p.m. during an attempt to arrest a crucial criminal our officer Isaac had shot him as he'd tried to escape. He escaped in spite of getting a shot. He collapsed at Adyar 4th Avenue. Someone had come on a bike and tried admitting him to a hospital. They didn't bother to help him. This man had bought medicines from a medical shop and had taken him home and operated on him. He saved his life. The criminal has escaped. Firstly, he rescued a criminal. Then, he let him escape. And finally, he didn't report this to the police. For these three reasons we're arresting your brother, Chandran.. - Sir.. This has happened in your house. We're arresting you too. Sir.. - Dear.. - And, ma'am.. You're also under arrest. You can't leave this house. You can't tell anyone about this, either. Three of our lady officers will look after you. They'll tell you about what you should and shouldn't do. Chandru, let's go. You can start the search right now. - Yes, sir. Instruct her on what she should and shouldn't do, okay? Yes, sir. Please come.. - Dear.. For how long have you known Wolf? - Who is he, sir? He's the criminal whom you rescued. - I hadn't met him before that day. For how long have you known Wolf? I promise, I've no clue who he is, sir. Please believe me, sir. Please let me go. I've no idea who he is, I swear. Sir.. Please, sir.. Idiot, what you did was wrong. Did you ask him to inform the police? I did at first. But he didn't have the time. He's a student. He's done an operation thinking it's heroic. You've helped him with the same! Ashok, he's sincere. It was an erratic act. But it's impossible to do splenectomy without proper guidance and knowledge. He did it alone, please try to understand. Whatever you say, you can't convince me. He has helped a criminal escape, it's a crime. We struggled so much to find Wolf. Hello.. Has he come? Ask him to come in. Come in. Good morning, sir. - Morning. Please sit down. It's fine, thank you. This is Dr. Manikyavel. He's the HOD for the student you've arrested. He says that anyone can attend a patient, in an emergency case. On humanitarian grounds, a medical student can treat even a criminal. So I've been told. So.. - The law supports them.. - Then why did you arrest him? It was wrong, yes. - See. We should've arrested him, first. - What? On what grounds? Sir, Section 201. Screening of a criminal. Section 202. Intentional omission of evidence. Section 216. For harbouring a criminal whose apprehension has already been ordered. We can arrest him on these grounds. - Sure, go ahead. The whole state of doctors will walk out of the hospitals.. - Please, doctor, calm down. Lal.. - I know, you both are very close. You were college mates for six years, in St. Joseph's, Trichy. So, you'll support him. But I can't listen to everything he says. Do you know what his student has done? He's used drugs. He anaesthetised the patient with that drug with this man's recommendation. If that drug is used outside the hospital it comes under Narcotics Act. Plus, he didn't even inform the police within 24 hours after the criminal escaped. He's at fault. He can request your help, as your friend. But it won't work with me. We've struggled for so long to find Wolf. We've struggled for two years now, with little sleep. He has murdered many souls. 14, to be precise. We have to find him. Somehow. Alive or dead. There's no other way. So, please ask him to be quiet and cooperate with us. I'm leaving, sir. We have a lot of work. Thamba, that boy knows nothing. But he's still in CBCID custody. Probably, Wolf will try to contact him. After a splenectomy operation, one can't move for eight days. Today's the fifth day after his operation. There are three days left. Don't worry. Wolf should be around. We can find him easily, Thamba. I've been searching for him for eight months. I haven't been able to find him. He's a wolf. It would be hard to find him. - Thamba. He can't go too far. There are cops all around the city. I need Wolf. I don't care what you've to go through but I need Wolf. Pichai, how much did I offer you for catching Wolf? - Rs. 50 lakhs. No.. I'll give you Rs. 1 crore. Thamba.. I need Wolf on my lap. I want to see him alive. And then, I want to see him dead. Hey.. Come here. Hello. - Buddy. Tell me. - Where are you? - I'm out. I've bought tickets for 'Thanga Meengal'. It's a night show, come. No, I'm not in town. I've come to my uncle's place in Cuddalore. Where is he? How did you find him? There are certain tricks that we know how to do. Has anyone come yet? We've been here for two hours. Nobody has come yet. Who? Is anyone with him? - No. - That's fine. That's just fine. Don't do anything yet. Observe him from a distance. Something will happen for sure. Someone will come. Pichai, what did Thamba say? Nothing, he says, he has nothing to do with Wolf. That's bullshit. Do you believe Thamba? No, but the logic makes sense. If Wolf had worked for Thamba, why would he shoot him? Okay, so what's your explanation? Someone would've assigned Wolf, to kill Thamba. As Thamba was near Edward's home, Wolf would've shot him. He shot whoever was with him as well. I don't buy this, sir. We have to interrogate Thamba, separately. Lal, it's not our cup of tea. The Law and Order team will look into it. Our present task is to hunt down Wolf. Where's the family that was staying in the opposite house? Sir.. We've received a call from Wolf. Hello.. Hello, who's speaking? Who's on the line? - I want to meet you. Who are you? - Wolf. Who? I'm the criminal you saved. - What do you want from me, sir? Did the cops come looking for you? - No, sir.. Do you suspect anyone is following you? No, sir. I have to see you. - Why? Tonight at 12:00 a.m., meet me at the bus stop near the temple. Sir, me.. Chandru.. Listen to me carefully. You rescued a criminal whom we've been behind for two years. He's a paid killer. There are 14 murder cases filed against him. I can empathise with you. But in the eyes of the law, you're a criminal too. You'll be facing punishment for what you've done. But only one person can save you. And that's you. You've to cooperate with the cops. Wolf has asked you to meet him tonight at 12:00 a.m. He can't escape this time. With your cooperation, we can make use of this opportunity to arrest a criminal we've been chasing for years. What should I do? - A murder.. - Sir! You've to shoot Wolf, dead.. - I can't do this.. - Sit down! How can I? Chandru, nobody can read Wolf's mind. He'd refuse to meet you if he knows the cops are with you. So, we've to keep at a distance from him. We'll cover a radius of 500 metres around. The chances are still bleak. He's cunning. He can't escape this time. So, you have to shoot him.. - Sir, no! Look at this. This boy was 18. He was blind. Wolf killed him. He's heartless. You have saved him. You have to kill him, now. Sir, I can't.. You can't become a doctor if you go to jail. Sir, I'll take this to court.. You'd have to battle this case for 10 years. Are you all blackmailing me? Not yet. We will, when you deny us this. Four officers from the Narcotics Bureau will come to see you tomorrow morning. Your brother will get into trouble. Minimum 10 years imprisonment. Doctor, tell me. Did I make a mistake? No, it was a crime. You should've spoken to your brother about it. He would've asked me to report it to the cops. I didn't have time for that. - Who were you to save his life? Are you related to him? I'm a doctor, Brother.. - Not yet. And you'll never be one. Listen to the cops. Are you asking me to shoot him to death? We have to survive, right? Chandru, apparently he's a murderer. You.. - Are you asking me to kill him? Should your brother suffer for a criminal that he doesn't even know? Chandru, as a doctor, you saved a patient. As a common man, for the society and law listen to the cops.. Wolf can't die.. Pichai, I have to get out. Thamba, you're in custody. It's not possible to get out. The cops will keep an eye on you. I told them that I was here to interrogate you. Pichai, I have to get out. - Thamba, listen.. - I have to! I'll try. Sir. - Something is wrong Isaac. There's something tricky going on. Wolf can't escape this time. He's being protected somewhere. He's safe. He's aware that there are cops everywhere. Why would he come out then? Why should he come to meet Chandran if it's such a big risk? To thank him.. - He could thank him over the phone. Sir! Sir.. Did you trace the phone number? - The call was from Thiruvanmiyur. It was switched off immediately. Alert all the cops within one kilometre radius from here. Wolf shouldn't escape. Murthy! Why are you reversing? Stop the vehicle. Listen to me.. Why did you reverse? Listen to me. Stop the vehicle. Maisu! Sir.. Sir, please inform the control room. This train shouldn't stop anywhere until we reach Beach station. Please, sir. He has fooled everyone. Sir, we should talk to the control room and shut down the train at the Triplicane station. Wolf will try to escape. We can kill him. That's absolute nonsense. What? Show some respect. If you suggest stupid ideas, what else can I say? I told you so many times not to involve that boy in this. You gave him a gun! He's not a small boy. He's a drug addict. If we stop the train, the boy's life will be in danger. Why are you supporting him? His face said it all. He's in association with Wolf. Adi and Lal, please be patient. This is no time to fight. - Okay, sir. Let the train reach Beach Station. We'll shut it down there. We'll kill Wolf. - Sir.. Whatever we do, that boy's life is in danger. Lal, will you please shut up? We have to kill Wolf. Sir, shall we go? - Where? To Beach station. - Why? The entire police department is going there. Wolf.. - Why should we go there? Wolf is going to be there soon. - Who told you he's going there? Remember, he tricked us by claiming he's in Madhya Kailash bus stand but he ended up in Kasturba Nagar railway station. Do you think he's going to wait at the Beach station? Where is he going then? - He's going to escape. How can he escape from a train that's moving? Sir, raise your hands! Sir, please. Raise your hands! Otherwise, I'll shoot! Get down on your knees and raise your hands. Otherwise, I'll shoot! I'm serious. If you surrender to the cops I won't shoot. Otherwise, I will! Sir, I'll count to three. Put the gun down before that. Otherwise, I'll shoot. One.. Two.. - Sir. I know that the cops are behind you. Which is why I asked you to meet me. Sir, my family is stuck with the cops. They're threatening to file a drug smuggling case against my brother. Please surrender to the police. Sir, I helped.. What the hell is happening here, man? You're bloody stopping us at every fucking corner. My wife is suffering a severe cardiac arrest. I'm taking her to the hospital. If anything happens to her, I'll screw your department. - Come here. Now what the fuck are you doing, man? The train has gone to Beach station. Let them go. - Okay, sir. - Do you understand? Sir, go.. - Bloody, irritating.. If anything happens to my wife.. - Go.. I'll sue the police commissioner. I'll kill everyone in the department. Listen, you illiterate fucker.. If you stop my car again, I'll fuck your happiness. Hey, let all the cars go. Thamba, you shouldn't have left the hospital. Go back there. I'll look into catching Wolf. I don't have patience. Just look at me! I'm holding a bag filled with urine. My wife left me. I'm living just to seek revenge against Wolf. I don't have time for your advice. Yuva! - Yes, Thamba. Cover the southern region with Pali. We'll cover the northern region. We should catch him before the cops do. Pichai, I hope your men in the temple, possess arms. - They do. Good. Sir, the train's been shut down. We could find neither Wolf nor the boy. Adi, by tomorrow morning Wolf should be lying dead in a mortuary. I don't care if anyone dies with him. Check every vehicle in the city. Doctors, ambulances, press.. All should be checked thoroughly. Okay.. - Okay, sir.. - Come on! Sir, inform me once you get any other details. Okay. Sir.. - Yes. We've identified the two men who were shot in the station. They're part of Saravannan's gang. Saravannan? - Saravannan is Thamba's friend. Oh.. Only our department was aware of Chandru meeting Wolf. How did Thamba find out about that? Someone from our department is giving information away. Yes, sir. 'Identify the two men. Try catching them.' 'Else, shoot them. Over.' Someone named Wolf has escaped. They're troubling us now. Hey, who are you? Why are you sitting here? Why have you tied him up? He asked you something. Don't you have an answer? Hey, what's your name? Tell me. Oh, crap. Stop.. Stop the car.. Hey, where are you coming from? We're coming from the auditor's office. Where are you headed? We're going to the lawyer's house. Why do you have to meet a lawyer this late, in the night? We just got an appointment. Why do you have to meet him? - We lost our dog. Sir.. - Yes! Come here, they're annoying me. What's the matter? - Talking to them is impossible. What's in the car? - Nothing. What? - Nothing. - Hey.. Keep an eye on these two. Hey, weren't you arrested in a double murder case? Weren't you in the hospital? How did you get out? Do you have permission? Oh, you do. Hey! Oh, no! Sir.. Sir, careful.. Hurry up. Oh, okay. How many officers are there? Did you search the area thoroughly? Oh, okay. Keep me posted. Okay. And.. Okay! Pugazh, give me a minute. Stay on the line.. We've found Pichai's phone records. For the past two days, someone has been calling him frequently. Okay.. - These calls have come from the Pay tower range. In the past hour, Pichai has contacted this person twice. Which tower range? - Araipuram range, sir. Come, let's go! Pugazh, we're going to cover the Araipuram area. Send me some patrol.. Inform the control room, immediately. Oh, God! Oh, God! Hey, take out your wallet. - Sir.. Take it out! Take out some change. You'll find a beggar there. Give her the change. Sir, right now.. I'll go, sir! - Go. Edward.. Don't come near me.. Edward, go away. Edward.. Edward.. Edward! Edward! Edward! Please come. Come. I can't walk, dear. Oh, God. Sir, we've to take him to the hospital, right away. He has to stay in the car. Then we can avoid the police.. - Sir, he's bleeding! Wait for a while. You can admit him to the hospital, yourself. Edward.. How are Karthik and dad? How did those two men find you? The both of them came to see me last afternoon claiming that you'd met with an accident. I didn't go. At night, they beat me up in a car. I told them that I didn't know where you were. They charred my feet with an iron rod. I couldn't bear the pain. I thought I'd just tell them where you were. Luckily, someone hit me on my head. I fainted. I woke up at the temple's entrance, again. Stop. Where's your helmet? - I left it at home. Show your license. Where are you coming from? - Sathyam theatre. Where do you stay? - Alandur. Show me your ticket. - I threw it away. What's in the bag? - Nothing. We need to check the bag, give it to me. It's empty! - Give us the bag. Sir! Oh, no! - Oh, God! Sir! Sir.. Sir. - Lal. Brief me quickly. I'm running out of time. Sir, six days ago, Edward's mother sat in front of a temple. The same night, Wolf slipped out of our hands. So, knowing we were following him Wolf must've brought her to an unsuspecting place. Similarly, he would've taken the rest of her family to different places. Why is Wolf doing this? What's the relationship between him and that family? - I don't know. But sometime ago, he met her near the temple and took her somewhere. Where? - It must be to unite her with the rest of her family. So, if we can track down the rest of the family we might catch Wolf. - Then, let's move. Go! Edward. - Tell me. I need to attend the call of the nature. Sir.. There's a stone beside you. - What? There's a stone to your left. Lift it up, slowly. - No, he has a gun. Sir, lift it.. - I'm scared. Edward.. I need water.. Edward. - I need water.. - Fetch him some water. I need water.. I need water.. I need water.. I need water.. Die! Die.. - Edward! - How dare you point the gun at me! Edward.. What happened? - What the hell are you doing? Die.. - Edward! You animal. You're a dog! Die.. - Don't hit him.. - I can't believe that I saved you. Don't hit him! Please I beg you. Don't hit him! You're supporting a murderer.. - No, he's not.. Do you know how much I struggled to save him? My family is in jail now because of him! He's not a murderer.. Edward! Don't hit him! Die.. - Don't hit him.. Edward.. - Does it hurt.. Do you understand what pain feels like? Let him go. Edward! Edward, where are you? Why did you shoot him? - Catch him! Let me go.. - Don't let him go, catch him! Let me go.. - Catch him.. - Let me go! Let me go. I need water.. Water.. Water.. Water.. Water.. Water.. Water.. Water.. "The path we've to walk on is not far away." "The life that we lead is no burden." "I need your shoulder to lean on." "There's no tomorrow." "There's no such thing as good or evil." "We lack the sense of sight." "The God we search for, is absent in the skies." "Let's hold hands." "There's no such thing as caste or religion." "We don't need justice." "Lord Jesus.." - Edward. Edward. Priscilla.. Priscilla.. - Hello, dear. Thank you. Why are you thanking me? We have to support each other during difficult times. We have brought him to you. We're leaving now. Mr. Edward.. - Tell me. Take your bag. We expected food, but found money. We don't want money. Bye.. - Okay. "..is not far away." "The life that we lead is no burden." "I need your shoulder to lean on." "There's no tomorrow.." What happened? - I've interrogated everyone, sir. Nobody new came here. Did you search every temple in this area? - Yes. Are there any mosques or churches in this area? There's a dargah.. - That.. Chandru! - I've shot and killed Wolf. Where are you now? Wait there. I'm coming. Let's go. Hey, who's there? Raise your hands. I'll shoot you. Hey, what are you doing? I did nothing wrong. I saw you, so was hiding.. Shut up. What are you doing out here so late, touring? Sir.. I haven't made any money yet. It hurts. Let me go.. - Which business? Prostitution, is it? Who's with you.. - No, sir. Nobody.. - Come here.. - Sir.. Singaram, look at her! Hey, what were you doing here? I came here to work. - What work? Kindly explain. He asked you something. Tell us! I'm a prostitute. - Tell us more. I use my body to make money. Hey, stop talking nonsense.. Oh, no.. - Oh, God! Where's Karthi? - Over there. Oh, no! - Where? She was right here. Brother Edward.. Stop right there! Don't come near me. If you take a step, I'll kill her. Brother Edward. - Please don't hurt her. Our efforts will go in vein. - I'm facing problems, too. This man, right here. My family is in jail because I saved his life. You can bribe the cops. But here, a family is suffering. They'll escape soon. Spare the child, please. - Shut up! Hey, I'll slit her. I'm going to become a murderer. Put the gun down. Do it! Brother Edward.. Slide the gun in my direction. Hey, push it further! Lie down. Lie down! Come, take the knife. Take it! Tear your sari and tie his hands with it. Hey, put the knife down. Go, tie his hands! Stick out your wrists! Hey.. Tie it tightly. Come on! Tightly! Where is that woman? Where's the couple? They're at the cemetery. - Which one? Calvary Cemetery. Sir.. Pichai.. Where's Wolf? Hey.. Take me to the hospital. Don't let me die. Don't leave.. Both of them asked us to come here and they've fooled all of us. I'm sure the boy is innocent. But Wolf.. - Shut your mouth! How can you be so sure that he's innocent? Why are we wearing this uniform? He's been making us run around all night. I don't know what you're going to do but you have to shoot him by tomorrow morning. Otherwise, I'll have to transfer all of you. Do you understand? Isaac, we lost, right? - No, we tried, sir. We'll definitely find him by tomorrow morning. - No, Isaac. Wolf has defeated us. By tomorrow morning, we both should resign.. What's today's date? - It's the 5th. It's already 2:30 a.m. What's today's date? It's the 6th, sir. - Yes, June 6th. Haven't we come across this date before in this case? Sir. - For how long should a patient rest after undergoing a splenectomy? Eight days, sir. - Why did Wolf escape within six days of the operation? He has some critical work today. Which is why he has come out. June 6th. Wolf gets out. He unites Edward's family. Is Edward a Roman Catholic or a Protestant? - He's an RC. Is there an RC cemetery nearby? - Calvary Cemetery, sir. Then, come! Hey, give me your phone. Hey! Go! Get down on your knees. - Listen to me. You're cheating us, isn't it.. - Oh, God! You're cheating us, isn't it.. - Oh, God! Hey, Singaram! It's Wolf.. Hey, you let him escape, right? I found him. - What? Did you find him? Give me the gun.. - I can't trust you. Call up the commissioner. - Hey, bring the walkie-talkie. Come quickly! Sir, you'll get promoted for sure. Try to get me promoted to SI.. - Get lost. '934 AC-17.' Control Room. E3-SI, here. We've found Wolf. We're at Smith Road. Over. Go! - What about the child? Leave without her! Who are you? - Why? Sit down. Oh, God! I got him. - Is he alive? Yuva, did you find everyone? Where are those two? - Where are they? They're at the cemetery. Which one? St. Thomas Cemetery. They're at the St. Thomas Cemetery. Find them.. I want the entire family. I want to kill all of them. I want Wolf to witness that and cry. I want to witness Wolf crying and I want to laugh. How much is Thamba paying you? Release me. I'll double it. You're a paid killer too. You know the rules. Thamba doesn't have any rules. He will send someone to kill you, someday. That's not happening. I will always listen to him. Unlike you. Are we robots to work like that? Yes, we are. I don't want to die at Thamba's hands. Kill me. - Brother Edward. Please kill me. I have to hand you over, alive. Brother Edward. - Shut up! Hey.. What are you doing? Hey, why have you switched on the indicator? The man following us did. What? Why have you put on the indicator? Why have you put on the indicator? Hey.. Seven. Six. - He's shooting and you're counting! Five. Four. Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop! Listen to me! Pull over! Hey, stop! Pull over! Hey.. Three. Hey, he's aiming at the kid! Two. Die! One. Stop! - I should've never saved you. Stop! Yuva, pick up the call! Yuva, pick up the call! Yuva, pick up the call! Thamba.. We've been cheated. We were overjoyed at catching Wolf and we blindly believed that boy. The family isn't at the St. Thomas Cemetery. They must be at Calvary Cemetery. It's near Smith Road. No, Thamba. I can't catch Wolf. It's not about the money. I'm going to die. Before I die, Wolf has to die. Sir, I couldn't find anyone there. - Okay. Karthi.. - Ms. Bharathi.. Karthi.. - Mom. - Karthi Daddy. - Karthi. Karthi. Karthi. - Daddy. Please be a little patient. When we escape you can go. Bharathi.. - Brother! You'll need it, leave. Ms. Bharathi, you didn't tell me any stories, today. Sure. Come. Come. Daddy. - Yes. Where are we going? - I'll tell you. Ms. Bharathi, tell me a story. Which story? Tell me a story about an animal. - Which animal? Tell me a story about a fox. Once upon a time, there lived a fox. The fox went inside the forest. An elephant chased the fox. And then, the fox.. Oh, God! Brother.. Ms. Bharathi! Daddy, where's Ms. Bharathi? She's gone home, dear. She didn't finish the story. I'll tell you the rest. Daddy, tell me the story. Mom, tell me the story. Brother Edward, will you tell me the story? Edward. Brother Edward, will you tell me a story? Once upon a time there lived a wolf. The wolf worked for a huge bear. The wolf would hunt down all the foxes in the forest that the bear hated. One day, when the wolf hunted down a fox a lamb got in the way. The wolf killed the lamb, unknowingly. Helpless and not knowing what to do the wolf visited the lamb's house. In the lamb's house, he met a father goat and a mother goat. There was a baby goat, too. A girl. The three of them were blind. The wolf felt sorry for them. He redeemed himself and stayed with the family. He took good care of them. The bear came searching for the wolf in the lamb's house, as he had stopped working for him. The bear asked the wolf, to work for him again. The wolf said he wouldn't. The angry bear told the family the truth behind the lamb's death. On hearing that the wolf curled up in a corner and cried. Then, the mother goat and the father goat came near the wolf and told him that he's their lamb too. And that he wouldn't have done it on purpose. They told him not to cry. They embraced him and told him that he'd be their lamb, henceforth. The wolf relocated with the family. Wherever he went, the bear chased him and found him. And asked him to get back to hunting. The bear started blackmailing the wolf saying that he would kill the baby goat and the parents if the wolf wouldn't work for him. Helpless and not knowing what to do the wolf attacked the bear. He kept travelling with the three blind people. The tigers who were protecting the forest somehow tracked down the wolf and found his location wherever he went. The wolf continued to run. The mother and the father goats couldn't run. The baby goat couldn't run, either. He hid them in a safe place. The wolf continued to run. A tiger, finally found the wolf and attacked him. The wolf escaped and was limping. He eventually collapsed. Then.. Another.. Lamb came up to the wolf. He took him home and treated his wounds. The next morning, the wolf ran away to search for his family. The heartless bear who was badly injured continued to hunt down the goats to kill them. On the other hand, the tigers chased them, too. The wolf's still running, aimlessly. Where will he go? How will he run? Tej, where are you? We've reached the cemetery. 10 minutes, is it? Come soon. Edward! Karthi.. Edward, what happened? Karthi! Hey! - Down.. Karthi.. - Go.. - Karthi! Come.. You go.. Hold it.. Hold.. Sir, Wolf has escaped. Hey! I'll shoot! Chandru, put the gun down. - I can't! Put the gun down! - I can't! We don't have time for this! - To hell with your time! Put the gun down.. Chandru, do you know the consequences of this.. - Get lost! To hell with your law and order! Put the gun down! Do it! Chandru.. - Sit.. - This is wrong! No, what I'm doing is right. What I'm doing now, is right. Who are you? What do you want? Edward! Take care of Karthi.. Brother Edward. What happened to mom? She has passed away. Shall we die too? You have to survive, dear. Brother Edward, what are we going to do? We're going to fight. Tej, you'll find a road on your right. Look to your left. You'll find a car parking. Come inside. Come to B2. Chandru, go home. Thank you so much. I killed that woman. When you carried the lady in the cemetery I saw the man who was trying to kill you. I turned around. But the minute she saw him without hesitation she sacrificed her life for you. But I didn't even bother. I killed her! I killed her. I killed her.. Wolf! Brother Edward. Hello, sir.. Come fast! Please come fast! Sir.. Tej, don't come. Go. I'm okay, now. Thanks. Sir, aren't you taking the child with you? You'll take good care of her. - Me.. Sir, the cops are here! Hold this. Keep it. Karthi.
