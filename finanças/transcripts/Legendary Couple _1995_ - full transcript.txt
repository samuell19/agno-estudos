I'll find it out! Mr. Lui... They are suspecting mw to be the informer! Only you can prove my innocence. | am not suspecting you, but it's hard to make me believe you.

Let him go first, alright? Handle the shit now! Now, | let you go, but it doesn't imply you are not guilty. You are the number one suspect of this case. You can't leave Hong Kong and should come to report any time. What's wrong with you? Do you want a medical check? Brother Sam, Ko's wife has been waiting for a long time. She is having serious stomach ache. Give her some medicine. Call the ambulance now. Honey! Your wife is going to have early delivery. Her ovary is contracting severely.

You can't make me to be fully responsible. By the way, | won't give you a penny. If you like, you may sue me. Those are my money! If you don't pay me, | won't leave! Have an eye on him, don't let him steal anything. The new medical scheme suggested by the government is strongly against by the pressure groups. They think that, the government is oppressing poor people who can't pay for private doctors. So, the poor and the sick will have heavier burden. And enlarge the gap between the poor and the rich. The police department announced the crimes report of the last 6 months. Violent crimes are increased rapidly. Among them, the armed robbery has the biggest increase. The sociologists think that it's related to decreasing living standard. The Post Office announced a raise in postage fee. From one dollar to... | am so poor, and you still want to steal my money. | will have a new building for sale two days later. No problem, | will ask three hundred people to line up tomorrow.

He said he is innocent, on the other hand, he kidnapped Miss Lui. Mr. Lui, he wants money, so he will contact you sooner or later. | worry that he'd take revenge on my girl instead of asking for money. Don't worry, trust me, Mr. Lui. Chan Sam, stay with the buddies and wait for Ko's call. Inform me when you have any new information. Yes Sir. Be smart. Mr. Lui, | am leaving. Why don't you search for them? Do you just wait here? Mr. Lui, it's useless to be impatient! You know, how much have | paid for tax each year? My money is to raise dumb-bells like you! Mr. Lui, fight crimes are our duties. We don't care how much tax one pays. However, we will try our best. Is this your home? How can you smoke here? Go to work... Help! Help! You maniac, | will tell my daddy!

You maniac. | don't want to catch you here. It's your dad who pushes me to do so. Did he offend you? He ruined my family! And ruined my future too! | don't think my dad would do such thing! If your dad... say something to prove my innocence. | wouldn't be detent for five hours. And my wife wouldn't have died for a late operation. My son wouldn't have lost his mother when he was born. Now, my son is staying in the hospital. My son is still in the hospital. You robbed my dad's money. No, | didn't do that! No, | didn't do that! He knew it very well. I've followed him for years. | am as loyal as his dog. Why didn't he says a word for me? And he cheated my pension of $200,000! Liar! He is generous to spend over $200,000 to hold a party for me! He won't cheat your money! He did rob my money. He prefers letting you waste his money than to paying me. Like father, like daughter! You are both selfish! Return my wife to me. Ask your dad to return my pension to me. Right, it's my dad's fault. | will ask him to return you money and apologize to you. But you must stay calm, OK! Stay calm, don't think anything nonsense No! Don't think anything nonsense! Wah your face... Have a bath, stay calm please. No! Don't rape me! Try hard to delay him. Hello. | am Ko Tin-Lap. Don't give my daughter hard time, how much do you want? | just want to get back my pension. | don't want a penny more. Alright, | will give you. But | want to know whether my daughter is safe or not? Let me talk with her. Daddy, | am fine... Now he wants ten million. And he said if you report to police, he will kill me. What's wrong? | didn't request 10 million. | am not that cheap!

No one will feed my baby! All units, pay attention, the money is ready. Got you, brother Sam. | haven't seen any police! My dad has one daughter only. Go and get the money, be quick!

And shoot to him. At last, a female student was shot. - Why would this happened? - And she was found dead... - You killed a girl! - ...on the way to the hospital. Now, the cop will pay two million as award. Damn cop, he wanted to frame me! | did see him kill the student! | don't kill! He framed me! You dragged me down! You said your father wouldn't report to the police. If you didn't ask for ten million, | wouldn't have fallen in deep shit. How much is your life? Just as cheap as mine! Shut up! | didn’t beat you, why did you cry? My daddy doesn't want me, he doesn't need me! He reported to the police! God isn't fair to me! | am always a decent citizen. | haven't spilled at all. Now, | am framed to be robber and kidnapper Now, they framed me of murdering! | don't know what is the use of the police. You promised me last night... That my daughter would be saved by you! Mr. Lui, your car is ready. If there is anything wrong with my daughter, I'll put you in the jail. What's wrong with you? How can you let him go? And he seized your gun to kill a girl too. My boss is angry as hell. He said we are damaging the image of the police force. If you can't fixed this case. | can't cover you too. No law at all. Shoot them... The government supports the merchants, no law at all..... Mr. Lui, about the case of Ho Tung Building. Those tenants sue you of using triad members to collect their flats. Isn't it rumor or not? Of course it is! | am a decent merchant! Can you comment more about this case? | think, the social unrest is because of the incapability of the police. Mr. Lui... Go to the hell! | wanna kill you! Don't move! Police. Cuff him! Mr. Lui Call the ambulance! Yes, Sir. Mr. Lui has just been attacked by a protestor. He is seriously hurt. About the details, we'll report in the late news. He deserves it. God is punishing you! Lui Yau Choi, you deserve it. Will there be traffic jam while he is on the way to the hospital? If there is any, that would be perfect. | know you hate my dad very much! | know many people hate him! But he is still my daddy. Will he... Will he die? Please let me go to see him! | beg you! You are your son's daddy too. If you get sick, who will you like to see? Save it. | promise, | won't tell the police that you are hiding here. You are his daughter, why should | trust you? Trust me, | guarantee with my life. | will come back right after seeing my daddy. Is there trust in this world? If you need me, | can be your witness. To prove what? To prove you haven't done anything. Did you see with your own eyes? If | saw it, | would like to say "l know" instead of "l trust”. One trusts with one's heart. Everyone treats me as thief. why do you trust me? Because of your behaviour. If God made all our wishes come true. There wouldn't have had rock and sand in the way to success. Any news about my daughter? Miss, you... Stop nagging, | come to see my daddy. Daddy... Chi Lan. Yes. It's you! | am glad to know you are safe. | paid ten million dollars to the kidnapper. It's the fault of the police. | worry so much! | am fine! Are you hurt? Anything wrong with you? | will have luck after escaping from great danger! How can you come back? Where did Ko hide you? Where is he hiding now? | am not kidnapped. Don't panic, isn't he blackmailing you? Just tell me. | am not kidnapped, | am telling the truth. | am not like some persons who didn't admit his own fault. Daddy, didn't you pay Ko his pension? He made me lost 5 million! Why should | pay him money? He didn't mean it, that's an accident! Just $200,000 and something, that's not much for you. Even he cheated you. He is so poor, just take it as donation. Two hundred thousand dollars is money, twenty dollars is also money. There are lots of poor people. Should | donate them all? Miss Lui, | don't care how poor he is. | know that he killed and he kidnapped! | hope you tell what you know. | know nothing. | just know that the student wasn't killed by him. Dad, we're human beings, what inside our body is blood not money. If you were a bit merciful, He wouldn't have become a wanted criminal. Many people wouldn't have slept on the road. And you wouldn't have lain in the hospital. Men should fight for his own interest. | don't think | am wrong. If you are not guilty, you needn't hire so many bodyguards. Don't care about your dad's business. By the way, | love you most. | give you the best things you want. Yeah, everyone can scold you in the street. But | can't. Since | am raised up by the money you cheated from others. Miss Lui, let me remind you, If you don't tell the truth, we may sue you of obstructing justice. If a policeman killed and framed the others. Isn't he obstructing justice too? Miss Lui. Thank you... One good turn deserves another. Shit, no money for transportation. Excuse me, | gave you all my money. Can you give me back $500 for transportation. What's wrong with you? You wanna rob my money? What's wrong with you! | just gave you the money. Are you idiot? Don't be silly. My money are all given by other, and that's why | am a beggar. You can earn money by being hostess. Yes, why you rob money from the elderly? You all blind! Why do you follow me? Do you want to arrest Ko to be your scapegoat? Or, do you want to kill him SO no one knows your crime? | warn you, stop any bull shit! | like it, so what? Indecent assault! Hands off! Police | am... On the wall. Spread your legs. Don't move! | am inspector Chan Sam of the Serious Crime Bureau. How dare you? Sorry Sir. Let me go... It's you! I've followed you for a long time. Don't you trust me? That police is fooled by you! He loves setting others up, so an eye for an eye. - Let's go for a drink. - Let's go for a drink. | won't go home again! | won't care about my dad any more. But you can't solve problems in this way. Not because | am angry with him. | think | am useless. | don't even know boiling water, cooking or frying an egg! | am like a trash! So many people envy you. When | am unhappy, nobody knows. Like my classmates, they study and work hard. They have their own targets. And | have everything after my birth! | don't know what | should do. | do want to suicide. There are lots of things to do if you don't even afraid of death. Like? Damn you, bitch! How cocky are you! That's too much! How dare you offend Mr. Wing! Do you want to be killed? How are you! Go to hell! How can you beat a woman up? Can you claim yourself a man? How dare you beat a woman? How dare you beat me? Beat her! Stop pulling off a stunt. Let your fellow hit by her, and no counter attack. Go Did you kick? Boss, she is tough! My fellow can't stand! Sio, you'd better take his place. Well, | think I'd better sit with you Fine.

Wonderful... | haven't experienced so many clapping hands since birth. | feel great! | will take you to do something meaningful. Alright, let's go. Sorry. Because of my mistake, | dragged you to death. Give me a chance. | will kill that thief by my own hands To kill an bad egg for the society. Sam, we guard here, how can they show up? Go and take a look at the baby. Yes. Ko tin-Lap, don't go! Or | will shoot! Baby... Why are they look like the same? Baby... What's up? Do you want to kill the witness? Don't go! Or | will shoot!

Baby, show mw a hint! | think this is reall He smiles when seeing me. Go... Bastard! You scared my son. Baby... Let daddy kiss you. Your mom's name is written. Why don't you tell me earlier? He smiles! I've found my son. Give it to me. How dare you frame me? Don't mess up! It's a big crime to kill a cop. You have rights to arrest thieves with your gun. Since the citizens trust you. But you commit crimes instead. If you didn't kidnap & blackmail, | wouldn't have killed the student. You dragged me down, you'd responsible for her death too. If not were you, | wouldn't have become like this. It's your fault, you wanted me to be your scapegoat. Right, | killed the student. As being a cop, our achievements can't cover one mistake. You know what? All these years. | have solved how many cases and caught how many criminals. | was wounded of how many times, but what? All over because of one mistake. Not only affect me, but also all the police. | am now a sinner. It is so unjust. You talk about justice to me! What about me? I'm now a criminal! | can go nowhere. | can't even get my son back. Is it fair to me? You only lost your job, what about me? | lost everything including my dignity. | am not even like a man. Since both of us have done something wrong, The world is so messy, it's better to have one more cop other than a thief. Let's go. My baby is so cute... You have said over ten times tonight. Don't move, | am treating your wound. Greet daddy, come on. Look, he is greeting me. The baby is cute! Good boy. Baby wants to sleep now. Again. Your leg is hurt. It's crashed by the police's cuff.

That's right. Don't move. Why do you have such kind of house? My wife is the local villager of this village. This is left by her dad. It's predestine. | couldn't imagine | would become like this. | hurt that cop. | don't even know it's right or wrong. We are the sacrificial lamb under the system. The society is getting worse.

The police is charging you prejudicial to the administration of justice. And we will consider to sue you of manslaughter. Cuff him. What do you mean? Officer John, | think it's not a must to cuff Sam. Shut up! You are employed by Hong Kong Government. Cuff him! Take him to the detention medical room. Publish the pictures of Ko Tin-Lap & Lui Chi-Lan, they are wanted now. Yes Sir. Baby, don't cry. You pissed. Baby, have some milk. Baby... | am glad to see you, he doesn't want to drink milk.

Don't cry... Am | scaring them? This is only a toy gun! Chi-Lan, are you OK? | can't handle it. It'll be alright soon. How is it? Don't kill me! Open the bottle, put about 10cc of water. Then put two spoonful of milk powder. Don't make it too fast, or the baby will have bad digestion. Then.... | don't understand, how much water should be used? Two ounce. Shake it... Then, can the baby drink now? Use your hand to test it. No need to try? Just make it the same as body temperature. Will it be stuffed? Try with the mouth, it won't be stuffed. How to change diapers? Pick up the baby's legs, and put the diapers in. Be gentle. | don't understand... slowly please. Let me do it. You have to be patient to take care of baby. Isn't it alright?

Just one trip and you can make big money Beware of police. Hong Kong is a lawful city, they need evidence! This is yours. Thank you, Brother Wei. If there is a chance, give me a call. Stop flattering me, just eat. What are you thinking? | am thinking what you are thinking. See you next time. See you. Don't move. We are robbers! Your first time! How can you tell it? Stay Calm, or you will be shot! Look at you two, your hands are trembling! Are you poor lately? Why do you bring the baby along? Shut up! Robbery, take out all your money! Hurry up! Show me! Police. Baby, be good. Hurry up please! Don't scare the baby! I've just about $100,000 left, take it to buy milk powder for baby. What’s this? At least it should be used for robbery. Mind yourself, or you will shoot. | don't mean it. Don't scare the baby! Pal, you are in bad luck to rob with children and woman. We are working in the same field, this is for you. As a present for your son. Are you kidding? Let's go... You are useless! You fainted right after seeing the gun! | pretended to be fainted! Or, how can | scare them away? This is my contribution! | pointed at his head with a gun. Except the gun, he said he would give me his car! It's true... What is this? Such a big bag, it's enough for his practice. Let's go!
