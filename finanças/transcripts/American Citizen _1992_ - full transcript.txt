Well, let's take the mattress. Leave it and I'll take it. -You sure? -Yeah, no problem. All right, I'll start taking this stuff out of the trunk. Remind me of home here, man. Is Segal gonna live with you? I don't know. I hope so. She's coming tomorrow. I expect to see you around here too. -Know a guy named Dennis Newman? -No, why? He's the guy that had this apartment before me, he played here last year. -That's it, man. All finished here. -All right, I'll start doing my car. So they said everybody was gonna be there. The mayor, the manager, coach.... Christ, it's gonna be like a press conference. I'm afraid they think I'm gonna get them in the national league single-handedly. Well, how is your brother? He's good. He's been really good. He's doing really well in college. He's got a new girlfriend. Nice one for a change. I would like to thank the two young people that came to us. Speaking about you and Danny. New residents in our town. We have a new citizen. The team's coach, Mr. Yigal Dror. I understand he's a promising young talent. Understanding me. And the young man to his left, Mr. Michael Peterson... ...who came to us after a stellar career in Tel Aviv. He's talking about your career. It's time Ashdod will have a good basketball team. It's time for us to have a good basketball team. And this year, we'll have it. And I think this year it'll happen. Thank you very much. Amnon, please. Yes, we're ready to answer any questions, please. They will be glad to answer the questions. We all know how well you have played in the last two years... ...but we also know that you were hurt last year... ...and that you are a year older, over 30. Can you still play the way people are hoping here? I just got back from a month in the States where I worked on my knee every day. It's fine. As far as my age is concerned, I'm 31. In my mind, that's not retirement age. Michael, meet Guy, Avi, Oren, Aitan. They're giving me a hard time in the army, talk to them. I'll talk with Amnon. Go get dressed. Oren. Okay. Pay attention. Court, steps, let's go. Okay. Oren. Go on! Move it! Guy, wake up! Oren, okay. -Danny, move it, you baboon. -Let's make a bet, you coward. Yes, lift your legs up, Kadosh. Promised me an interview with Michael Peterson, and to take his photos. -But when? -I'll personally take care of it, Joel. -You have my word. -You promise? Thanks a lot. Yes, yes, that's good, Kadosh. Go. Stay close to him, stay close to him. Good, good, Michael. -Enough with your bullshit. -What's the matter? -I know it's you. -Turn around. It's not funny. We'll take care of it tomorrow. Bye. Hi, Michael, wait a minute. -How do you feel? -I feel fine. A little bit tired. -How is your knee? -Knee's okay. -How long you guys been practicing? -A week. Hey, Michael. I need a picture of you. -Who is this? -My name is Joel Levi. And I cover basketball for the Ashdod News. -Is he for us or against us? -He's okay, he's okay. I have to go. Come by practice tomorrow? Yige'al, how do I get to Amnon's office? As you can see, I'm a businessman. I don't come from the world of sport. I know you've been in Israel a few years. You've dealt with a lot of teams and team managers... ...who promised you all kinds of things. What I want you to understand is for me, you are going to get your money... ...exactly the way it's written in your contract, right on time. I want the best for this team. I brought you here and I want you to be happy. I brought a new coach too. I'm sure you know him. -Yeah, he was the assistant coach-- -He was the best assistant coach in Israel. And now he's going to be the best coach in Israel. Listen to Amnon. He's a tough guy, but he knows what he wants. Don't ask what I went through with him to bring you here. -You mean, he didn't want me here? -No, no, no. He thought he needed another big man. I wanted an Israeli big man. Never mind, I don't know what goes on in his head. Main thing is that now he's happy that you're here with us. That's what's important. That's it. I wanted us to get to know each other... ...for me to get to know you and for you to get to know me. How do you get to the bus station? I need to pick somebody up. Sure, come on. Did you miss me? Of course, I missed you. What happened? I threw out my knee. I'm sorry, Segal. I know, I know. -There's a grocery store across the street. -What? I didn't hear you. I said that there's a grocery store across the street. I bought a newspaper. Anything about me? Actually, yes. Already? What's there to write about me? Come on, what's it say? It says they shouldn't have brought you here. They should've brought somebody else. -That you aren't what the team needs. -That's it? That's bullshit. They can write whatever they want. It says that for the money that you're getting, we need a better player. Are you really getting $60,000 this season? What? Who's the asshole that wrote that? Let me see it. He's name is Joel. Joel Levi. That prick. What the hell does he care how much money I make? People in this country don't understand it's none of their business... ...how much somebody makes. Son of a bitch. -Do you know him? -Yeah, I know him. Oren, Oren. Okay, guys. Go shoot some penalties. Michael. Michael. Michael, I need to talk to you for a second. Not now, I'm busy. Thank you. Hello? Yes? Fine, thanks. Yeah, I know who he is. He asked me, yeah. What? What for? What do you mean do me a favor? This guy tries to ruin me in his paper and I'm supposed to give him an interview? Here? No, no way. No, because I don't want him coming here. Yeah, it's only about a block and a half from here. All right, yeah. Tell him I'll be there. Bye. This guy wants me to give an interview. -Who's he? -Amnon, the team manager. So give him the interview. Why not? Michael, Michael. Michael, Michael. What's your height? -One minute. -Thank you. -Hi. -Hi. -Do you feel all right? -I'm okay. Please. Sit. Why didn't you want us to meet at your place? Is that thing on? No, not yet. Well, I just moved in and everything is kind of a mess. Are you sure you're all right? We can do this some other time. No, I must hand it in by tonight. -But do you mind if I lie back? -No, sure, go ahead. Got yourself a little America here. Pictures and magazines, where did you get all these? From my sister. She lives in the States. Sorry, I'm just-- She sends them to me. I can just interview myself if you want me to. I know all the questions by heart. Okay. Where did you play before coming to Israel? I played two years in the CBA, a year in Argentina and two years in Spain. How many years you been in Israel? Two. What's the difference between American and Israeli basketball? They're the same, only played by different players. Managed by different managers, coached by different coaches. Do you plan to stay when your career is over? No, I don't think so. Why? Don't you like it here? Yes, I do, but I'm still an American. -How am I doing so far? -So-so. What? Well, you got better questions? Why didn't you want us to meet at your place? To tell you the truth, I didn't want us to meet at all. Hi, this is 298053. Leave a message. Bye. Hi, Segal, it's Michael. Give me a call. Bye-bye. -Hello, I'm your neighbor. -Hi. I live right there. I hope I'm not disturbing you. No, it's okay. I just want to ask-- -Our telephone is out of order and-- -Come on in. -May I use your telephone? -No problem. -Right over here. -Thank you. I must call my son. My wife is feeling not well. Hello? Yes. Not good. They asked us to bring mom to the hospital tomorrow. ...and I think the change is.... Guys, first game, first check. -Good luck. May we have a good season. -Thanks. -So you don't like our country, Michael? -Is that what he wrote? That and some other things you talked about. He attacked me too, even more than you. But I'll take care of it. Tell me, do you read Hebrew? No, but my girlfriend can translate it for me. Forget it, no big deal. I'll take care of him. You know these reporters, always looking for bad points. By the way, how is your situation, actually? Are you really a Jew? Sure I am. I took care of that before I got to Israel. I don't know much about these things. As I told you, I just pay. Well, I don't know much about it either. I just play. Go, go, go! Right! Left, left! Left, left! Give him the ball! Good, good! Good, good, good. Good, good, good. Foul. Ball. Michael! Game. Tell me, why does he take you out so fast? I don't know. Ask him. Listen, Michael. I wanted to talk to you about the headline of that article. I didn't put it in. It was my editor. He wants all of the articles to be much more aggressive. I was in shock when I saw it. But, you know, he does that to me all the time. Changes things around. I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't seen the paper. Okay, so just so you know. If you do see it. Do you want me to bring it to you tomorrow? It has your picture in it. Really, a great one. Hey. Do you want this magazine? My sister brought it. Your sister sure sends you a lot of magazines. -What does she do in America? -She lives there. It's eight, seven-- Eight years already. But she's visiting now, and she brought this one with her. Okay, good night. Come here, come here. I get you an interview, and you're dissing both him and me? Are you nuts? Don't tell me stories about an "editor". I don't give a crap. You're not getting on this bus or standing in the court. Buy a ticket and sit in the balcony. That's all. I don't wanna see you anymore. I'll be there to spite you. Hey, Michael. Could you give me a ride home? Bye, Michael. Half the team is there. They want us to have a drink. Why didn't you come in? They want you to have a drink. I've already bugged them enough. No. Today was the first week, yeah. There's also an interview with me here and, of course, I have no idea what it says. So there, now you've got a reason to come. Well, maybe the chance for you to finally learn Hebrew. It will give you something to do. Yeah, maybe. It might not be such a bad idea. Listen, Segal, I could come to Tel Aviv. Yes, okay. But call first. This is our first home game. And it's crucial. Remember, whatever happens, don't let him go to the left. All right? Look, he is a good player. If you can keep him from getting his normal 25 points... ...we're gonna win the game. Now, listen... ...I don't think there has to be anything personal between us. We don't have to be friends. I just want you to respect my decisions, since I'm the coach. Is it clear? Hey. All right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Up, up, up. Up. What are you doing here? I told you not to come here anymore. -I wanna go to my spot. -You don't have any spot! You're not going anywhere, you piece of shit! Go watch the game from the balcony! Get your hands off, you piece of shit. How dare you touch him? What's going on? You better watch out, Amnon. That man there is Joel's uncle. Now Amnon didn't let Joel sit in his place... ...because Joel wrote something about him last week. Quite a character, this Joel, huh? Hey, look at that. Defense. Defense! Rebound! -Start throwing! -Go in! Michael. Go! Defense! Hands! Hands! Guard him! Come on. Go, team Michael! Switch. Switch! You bastard! What's this? -Hi. -Hey. I was just passing by and I wanted to see how you are feeling. And I brought you this too. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot, but I've already got it. -Come on in. -Thanks. -And how do you feel? -Oh, I'm okay. -You're sure you are not busy? -Sure. I'm sure. -Come on in. -You know-- -Sit down. -You know, I know your neighbor. Mr. Kaufman. I studied with his son once. I used to come here a lot as a kid. Yeah, I met him. He seems like a really nice guy. So when you think you'll be able to play again? I don't know. I think I'm gonna need an operation this time. It goes pretty fast with this new arthroscopic thing. The laser beams? Got a tape of a game from last season. Wanna see? -Sure, I wanna see. -Great. You've probably seen it a few times already. No, actually, I haven't. Only seen the first couple of minutes. Nothing happening so far. Isn't Derrick Chievous is playing for Houston? -Who? -Derrick Chievous, Band-Aid. -Band-Aid? -Yeah. That was his nickname in college. He used to always play with Band-Aid on his leg for no reason. He was first-draft choice of Houston two or three years ago. What--? Where did he play college? Missouri. I can tell you where every player went to college. Is that right? Okay, let's see. Right now. So let's start with Houston. Olajuwon, that's easy, Houston. Sleepy Floyd, Georgetown. Buck Johnson, Alabama. Otis Thorpe, Providence. That's an easy one too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, very easy. You're a little crazy. You know that? Hello. Thanks, but you're five minutes early. It's nice of you to remember. Listen, I screwed up my knee today. This son of a bitch came at me like a truck and went down flat on my knee. Well, I think I'm gonna need an operation this time. Yeah. All right. I thought I'd come tomorrow, maybe the next day. Okay. Hey, thanks for calling, buddy. All right, bye-bye. You can add another line to Venezuela. The guy who lived there before you is playing there now. -You know him? -Sure. But I never got to talk to him. You know, he was really bad, he smoked and drank all the time. Really crazy one. They kicked him out in the middle of the season. Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. That's it. I'm 32. Congratulations. -Thanks. -I mean, happy birthday. I understood. I know a little Hebrew. Did you ever study? Started a few times, went to an ulpan in Tel Aviv. I started three times. I finally just gave up. Everybody here speaks English. It's a lot easier. It's too easy, even if you wanna learn Hebrew. Hello? Hi, Mom. Thank you. I know. I miss you too. I wish I could be there with you. More than ever, believe me. Yeah. Are you kidding? This is like a B league. We play in gyms. We're lucky if a hundred people show up. Listen, Joel, I need a favor. Can you give me a lift to Tel Aviv? I mean, if you're not busy. I don't know how to drive. What do you mean? I mean, I don't have a driver's license. I don't know how to drive. You're kidding me. Why not? I just don't have one. I never did. And I never even wanted to learn how to drive. Joel, I wanted to-- Sorry. -What's going on? -Nothing. I'll talk to you later. Okay. That was my sister. Hey, wait a minute. Rachel. No, I'm not from New York City. I'm from Schenectady. Yes, I know where that is. -Listen, will it be okay if I pick you up at 8? -Yeah, that's fine. So, what do you do in New York? -I'm studying. -Rachel is finishing her studies at Juilliard. She plays the piano. Yes, but the real musician in our family is Joel. He probably hasn't told you that he plays. He played the piano. He could've been a marvelous musician. -Hey, Rachel. -What are you doing covering basketball? -You should be playing the piano. -It doesn't interest me. I played enough when I was a kid. -Are your folks musicians? -No, not at all. Our father died when we were very young. Oh, I'm sorry. -This is where your friend lives? -No. Just for a minute. I have to see somebody. No one was home. Let's go to Rodney's. Take that, it's my phone number, in case you need it. Which way should I go? Straight. -How are you doing? -How are you doing? -This is Joel. -Hi. How are you? Come on in. Come and meet some people. This is Eddie. Fancy meeting you here. Hi, Michael. -How you doing? I'm Michael. -Nice meeting you. -This is Joel. -Nice meeting you too. You want something to drink? Yeah. Coke. Me too. How are you? I'm okay. Other than my knee, everything is great. I tried to call you last week, but I guess you weren't home. Yeah, right. We're out of here. It was nice meeting you all. Bye, Michael. -Bye. -Bye. Thanks. Thank you. I'm sorry. They surprised me. I didn't know they were coming. How long they've been together? I don't know, but I don't think it's anything serious. She used to be my girlfriend. By the way, man, happy birthday. What are you drinking? You want a vodka? Oh, no, no, no, I don't drink. I'll have orange juice if it's okay. Orange juice? Have a beer. We're celebrating. Okay. But in a small glass, please. By the way, I hear you're a walking basketball encyclopedia. You can just ask him anything. See for yourself. Okay. Who are the starting five for the Boston Celtics? Wait. What are you talking about? Boston starting five? Ask him a real question. Okay, I got a good one. Give me the names of the rookies of the year... ...in 1961, '62, '63, and '64. I'll give you a hint. All four played for the American Olympic team... ...in Rome in 1960. Okay. We start with Oscar Robertson. He played for Cincinnati and was awarded rookie of the year. Walt Bellamy played for Chicago... ...Terry Dischinger, also from Chicago... ...and Jerry Lucas. He played for Cincinnati at that time. You're sick, man. You're a sick man. -That stuff was before you were born. -Wait, I don't understand. How did you know to even ask that question? I read it yesterday in an old Sporting News. -Hey, how is it going? -How are you? -I'm with a couple of guests, see you later. -All right. That guy is an agent. American ballplayers come in here after games. Yeah. I already feel like I'm in the middle of New York. -It's still early. -You ever been to New York? No, no. I never been to America. I have to make a phone call. Where is the phone? Right around the corner. Over there. Okay, thank you. So you think Eddie and Segal will show up here? They might. So how is the team? The team is okay. The guys are okay, but the coach is killing me. -It takes all the fun out of playing. -Are they paying you on time? They were, until now. This month they were late. And another vodka. Are you trying to kill yourself? Thank you. One for him too. I told my sister we are here. -What's this, vodka? -Yeah. Oh, no, no, thank you. -Come on, have one. -It won't be good for me. Just try it. Come on, it's not gonna kill you, believe me. You want us to be friends, don't you? All right. Have a beer, it helps. That was too strong. Wait a little bit before the next one. You all right? You look a little pale. Why won't you go outside and get some fresh air? -So you have a reporter of your own? -Yeah. He's a good guy, though. -He's lonely, you know? -Who? Hello! Hello! Joel. Joel. Hey, hey, hey. What's the matter? Joel? -Don't touch him. -Take it easy. What's wrong with him? He's an epileptic, didn't you know? You gave him alcohol, you idiot? I didn't know. Down! Down! -Look at this Michael.... -What do you want? He's injured. -Who's injured? -Aren't you listening? -Oren! -Look at him... -...trying to save the motherland. -What is he doing? Back to defense! Go back to defense and start guarding! -Goddamn it. You can't pass the ball? -Shut up. Come on, you jackasses. Okay, boys. Look, You know we have some money problems this month. I want you to know that you don't get the money not because you're losing. But I also want you to know things will probably be fixed tomorrow. That is all. Wait, wait a minute, Amnon, what's the deal with the money? It's already been a month and a half and I just-- Don't worry, everything will be all right, trust me. Oh, Michael... ...how's my English? Your English? Financially, the farmers have to spend a lot of money for the irrigation waters... ...which was not planned this season. The Drought Damages Fund will compensate them for their losses... ...but there will be no profits this year. Excuse me, I am the son of your neighbor, Mr. Kaufman. We need another man for the prayer. You see, we are only nine and we need 10. It's for my mother. She died. ...during your lifetime and your days and the lifetime of the House Of Israel... ...speedily and very soon, and say Amen. May his great name be blessed forever and to all eternity. May there be peace, life, satisfaction, help, comfort, refuge, healing... ...redemption, forgiveness, atonement... relief and salvation for us and for all his people Israel and say Amen. May He who makes peace in His high places grant peace for us... -...and for all Israel and say Amen. -Amen. Thank you very much. Michael! Michael! -Hi. -Come with us, we will drink. -We will laugh a little. -No, thanks. Take him to the sea, loosen him up, show him the town, he looks completely down. Thanks, you guys, but I'm kind of tired. You're tired. You only go with him. He makes everybody tired. They're assholes. No, they're not assholes. That's what they are like. Come to Israel for a visit. Tell me, do you wanna come over for dinner? My mom's a great cook. How do you like our city? Well, I like it here, it's nice. Quiet. -Have you ever visited anywhere else? -Oh, yeah, sure. Michael's been in Israel for two years. Well, what do you know? Where have you been? Let me see. I've been almost everywhere. To Galilee, Eilat, Ein Gedi... ...Caesarea, Jerusalem, I'm going there again tomorrow. I think he's been in more places in Israel than I have. That's not so hard. -Where's Rachel? -Went to Tal Aviv -She's in rehearsals. Thanks. -Glad you enjoyed it. Thanks. -Welcome. -I'd like to do some more traveling. I got all this time on my hands and I figure why not? -Do you have a map of Israel? -No, he doesn't He has one of Los Angeles. What, didn't you know? He's an American citizen. I have a map and I'll be happy to give it to you. But only on the condition that you take this lazy fellow with you. Let him see his own country for once. Are you going to Jerusalem? Take him. I'll bet he's never even seen the Western world. Have you ever seen a Jew... ...who hasn't been to the Western world? I'll be right back. I'm going to bring the map. -No, no, it's not urgent. -No, no, it's okay. He lives here. Right next door. -He really takes care of you. -Yeah, he takes care of all of us. He more or less raised me and my sister. So, what, you're gonna do it here, in Jerusalem? Why not? I mean, I'll be here, I'll be in bed for two days and I go home. I'll tell you, this operation's a breeze. There's nothing to it. Oren and Avi will play inside. Guy can play the shooting guard and you play point guard. Sorry. Thanks. Michael. Look, Sleepy Floyd, Doc Rivers, Harper... ...they were all second guards in college... ...and today they are the playmakers. I'm telling you, it's not a new idea, even in Israel. Guy Goodes runs plays sometimes. Listen, Michael, we have to do something. Not only we're not gonna move to the national league, okay... ...but we may end up moving down. Yeah, maybe, I don't know. You have a pen and paper? Yes. Of course. Do you think... ...if I write something... -...he will read it? -I hope so. But there is already an awfully long line here. Everyone's before you. You know what? So what did you write in your note? No, you're not allowed to tell. It's between you and him. So what did you write? I asked... ...for my knee to be okay, for the operation to succeed. I asked for my family to be healthy. That was the first thing I asked for. And I asked for a family of my own. You know, a nice, happy family. I asked first for the team to succeed. I mean, not to go down a league, and next year, to go up. If you're religious... ...I mean if you really, really believed in God... ...would you ask him to make you better? I'll never be better, with or without God. Block his back! -What an ass. -Guys, you're not playing. You're just not playing. Shame on you. Give him the ball! Give it to him! Do you even understand the mess we're in? I have a feeling you're not getting what I'm talking about. Rebound. Rebound. They're so useless! -We'll drop a league if we keep this up. -What about the money? Get away from here, not now. -I've been broke for two months now. -I don't care. Look, all of you can stop coming to play if you want. But as long as you're coming to play, I want all the rest of your problems... ...including the financial ones, to stay at home. Do you understand? Do you? Yeah? It's okay. What? How do you know? Was he fired or did he quit? All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Why tell me he's not here? Tell me he's busy. Tell me he's on the phone, but don't tell me he's not here! -I told you but you-- -You did not! You said he wasn't here. In one month. You don't want to? Then sue me. You can see for yourself, he has many problems now. And I'm telling you, he won't have time for you. Michael. I didn't know you are waiting. Come in, come in. I want to be straight with you. I already told you, I don't understand basketball... ...but I thought that with you and that idiot, Yige'al... ...things would work out and we would win. And people would come and we will do something good for the city. But it's not happening. -So first of all, I fired the ingrate coach. -I know. -How did you know already? -It doesn't matter. I know, it's your reporter friend. Be careful of him. He asks many questions and stick his nose where he is not wanted. All right, let's just forget about that for now. What happens next? I need a coach now. Urgently. So I thought that with all your experience and understanding of basketball... ...maybe you could be the coach. And when your leg gets better, you could also play. -No, no way. -Why? If you don't mind telling me. Because I'm not a coach. I don't know how to coach and I don't wanna coach. I came here to play ball for a year, to earn some money. Listen, Michael. You're injured now... ...and you're not doing anything except asking for money. You're not doing anything but you want everybody to run in circles around you. Well, forget it, do you understand? Forget it. And don't come around here anymore. There is nothing for you here. And you're not gonna get your money for another two months. I don't have it. And just so you know, I don't care if the team doesn't play at all. I don't care if it falls apart. It makes no difference. I have enough troubles of my own. You now what? I don't care either. But you're gonna pay me the money you owe me. Hey, Michael! There's no practice today. What, nobody told you? Nobody tells me anything. No money. No money, no team. -Nobody come. -Hey, Michael. Joel! What are you doing here? I came to see what was happening, if there's any practice. If anyone would come. Listen... ...Amnon's in more trouble than we thought. I've just done a story on the whole situation. So if Amnon wasn't connected with the team... ...then you wouldn't have written the article? Probably not. Probably I wouldn't have bothered to investigate... ...and then I wouldn't have known anything about it either. But he really is a crook. People have lost their savings and their homes because of him. Do you ever think of doing something else? Like going back to your music, maybe? Something like that. Did you ever think of doing something else? Why don't you coach? I'm a player, I'm not a coach. Look... ...I came here to play ball and I wanna play ball. But if everything falls apart, then I just go back to Schenectady. That's life. Listen, which NBA coach came from Schenectady? I never asked you that. I have no idea. I can hardly say the name. -How do say it? Sche-- -Schenectady. I have no idea. Pat Riley. How could you not know that? Hello? Hey. No, I was over at the neighbor's. Sure. When do you want me to come? Now? Why, what's wrong? No, I was on my way to Tel Aviv to see Rodney. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. Bye-bye. What's with your knee? I go in for an operation, probably next week. And how soon would you be able to play after the operation? If everything goes okay, about three weeks. Okay. How much money did you make this year? I don't like talking about money. But let's assume you are making $40,000. Okay, wait, I wanna understand what's going on here? Joel told me what's happening with your team. About Amnon, that crook, and everything else. Now, there is something I want you to know. Joel is like a son to me. He is the son of my brother, may God rest his soul. And I would do everything for him. But he lives for basketball. What can I do? I don't even know who those people are, but he loves it. So listen, Michael, I'm going to take Amnon's place. I want you to stay here on the team, to coach. One thing I hope... ...although we don't know each other very well. I hope that you don't think I'm trying to cheat you... ...and that I'm very serious about all this. Michael, meet my wife. -Joel, your new coach. -Nice to meet you. Our family loves to hug each other. Don't worry, I won't hug you. -I'll go get something to drink. -Okay. I gotta go. I just wanna know who's gonna take care-- Sit down. Everything's being taken care of. You have nothing to worry about. Sit down, it's all right. Invite Michael to your concert. -I don't know if he's interested. -He's interested. He's interested. Joel. Inside. Guy, go. Back. Back. -Go in, Go in. Double up! -Good job, Joel. Go in. -How you doing? -How you doing? Good. Hey, listen. They moved up my operation. If everything goes okay, I'm gonna be back sooner. -Well, that's great. -Yeah, it's fantastic. Hey, you put that in your paper. It's your first scoop. I've left the paper. -What? -I don't write for them anymore. -When did that happen? -This morning. I don't get along with my boss anyway. And besides, I don't think it would be right for me... ...to keep writing about the team when my uncle is the manager. Basically I'm the one in charge now, so don't laugh at your boss. Okay. All right, if you're the boss, you sit here... ...and don't move. We're in this thing together. It means you can nag me all you want. -Hi. How you doing? -Hey. Good. -Hello, Michael. -Hello. Good to see you. Hi. You see, that's how you should dress. I thought, what the hell, it's a concert. First time I've worn a suit. Don't pay any attention, Michael. You look very handsome. -Thank you. -Very handsome. -Thank you. -Let's go. Let's go. -What happened? -I had an operation. It's not as bad as it looks. Come in. I really wanted to hear this piece again. I haven't listened to the music since Rifka's been gone. You know, we used to sit and listen. -I-- If you don't wanna listen, I just-- -No, no, no. It's okay. It's perfectly okay. I even thank you for coming. Otherwise, I might not have the courage. It's good when two people enjoy the same things. But that didn't work that way with our son. He played a little piano then stopped. And how was he? Could he play? He was not a big talent. But your friend, Joel, who studied with my son, he was talented. Very talented. It's a crime that he stopped playing because he could go very far. Do you know why he stopped? I have no idea. I understand you met with Mr. Levi, so you all know what happened. Officially I'm the coach. But as far as I'm concerned, Rammie's the coach. And that goes for you guys too. We have five games left. We have to win three... -...in order to stay in the league. -Two won't be enough? No, I wanna win three to make sure. I want this team to stay in the league. And we have a good manager now who believes in us... ...and I don't wanna let him down, all right? Let's go right here. Have a good practice. -On three. One, two, three. -Ashdod. I'm telling you, if they hadn't given him that fifth foul, we could have won this game. What a terrible game. Now I'm not sure that we can win the two that are really necessary. -How is your leg? -Good. I'm gonna give it another day's rest... ...and then I'll go to the training room day after tomorrow. Michael, tell me the truth. Do you think we can win the rest of our games? I don't know. I hope so. Joel, why did you stop playing the piano? I was sick of it and it bored me. And besides, I was already the best one in town. That's what I heard. Both sides. Defense. -Defense, defense, quickly! -Take it, take it. Hands! Defense! Defense! Give it to Danny! It's a foul! What's this? -Did you see that? -He was right. It was an offensive foul. Rammie. Rammie, come here. Tell Danny to post up his man. It worked once, keep doing it. If that's not there, get the ball to Oren in the high post, all right? -Danny. Danny. -I have no idea what you just said. That's exactly the trouble with you people. Nobody who manages basketball around here understands the game. I'm telling you, if we go down a league, the whole thing will fall apart. We'll never even be able to think about moving to the national league. That's why I behave like this. You're the manager now, right? Make sure I have a free court tomorrow morning. I wanna start shooting baskets. -No problem. -Michael, come here for a moment. -Michael, you're an American, right? -Right. And you know what an employee and employer are, right? Okay, I want to tell you that if anyone had talked to me the way you did... ...during the game... ...I would have thrown him out on his ear. But in your case, I'll talk to you in your own language. So listen, Michael. I'm the boss. Is that clear? -You're absolutely right. I'm sorry. -Okay. I'm not going to sit next to you on the bench anymore. Only Joel will sit next to you. Because maybe I don't understand anything about basketball... ...but I understand business. And I'm going to make good business out of this team. So from now on, you have to be more involved in each game. You won't just sit on the bench and make comments from time to time. You're going to start working. You're the only one who can keep the team in the league. How's your knee? It's okay. It'll be a hundred percent by next week. Okay. Go on back to Joel now. I like you, Michael, you know? Even though you were a schmuck. Throw the ball right here. Hey. History's made. Rachel in the basketball gym. Go on. Don't mind me. -Watch. I'm gonna make 10 out of 10. -Bullshit. Just toss me the rebounds. You'll see. You wanna bet? Make any bet. There's no way you can do it. Even though your shot's looking pretty good. My shot always looks good. This is ridiculous. This three-point line's way too close. Here's what we'll do. I'm gonna shoot 10 shots. If I make them, you're gonna play the piano for me, all right? If I don't, I forget this whole piano business. Won't ask any more questions. Okay, 10 out of 10. -Sure. -Okay, here we go. Michael, thanks. So what do you do here when you're alone? Doesn't it drive you crazy? What are you smiling about? I've been here a week. I'm bored to death. I know. In the beginning I was so lonely... ...all I can think about was going down to Tel Aviv. Let's go there now. I can't. I've got practice. Besides, lately, I've been lonelier there than here. I mean, Tel Aviv is a big city. I'm from Schenectady, not Manhattan. There, I hardly knew anybody. I hung out with other Americans. -But here-- -Michael. Michael. Come here. Just a minute. I'll be there in a second. Who's that? The old manager. The one before your uncle. I can't stand him. Somebody called me that way, I'd turn a table over on him. All of a sudden you don't have time for me. You used to run after me like a dog. -Who do you think you are? -Be quiet. -Don't tell me to shut up. -Shut the hell up. Enough. You and I have nothing to say to each other. Leave. Why? Who the hell are you, piece of shit? An old American basketball player, you're nothing. Zero. Nobody's gonna help you. Not even that bitch's uncle with her sick-- -Michael. -Come on. What you gonna do? Leave him alone! -You'll be hearing from me. -Fuck you. What are you doing? I have practice with the team now. Why are you standing? Sit down. You're tall enough as it is. I have practice. Okay, okay. When? -An hour and a half. -So? I need to get there early so I could shoot around. I gotta get back in shape. So why did you ask me over? I didn't ask you over. You came on your own. You knew I had practice. You're quite a guy, you know that? What happened to you? I thought you were gonna come by. I'm sorry, I stayed at home. I was really tired. Listen, Joel.... Do you mind if I go out with Rachel? Tell me the truth. You already went out with her, didn't you? But why should I mind? She's a great girl. I'd go out with her too. I had a dream about her last night. Strange dream, I didn't understand it. She was trying to talk to Mr. Kaufman. They were at some kind of a demonstration, with signs and everything. And also the picture changed. And I saw myself trying to get to the airport. But when I got there, they said that there are no more flights to America. They'd all been canceled forever. Do you dream a lot? Especially lately. Hand me the towel, will you? Hey, that's a great T-shirt. You like it? You can have it. I got another one. Thanks. Play. Look for it. Yeah, good job. Good job. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Come on, guys. Let's go. Great. The band, these people. Where did they come from? We let the kids in for free. Rebound. Rebound. Come on, guys. Let's go. Run it. Run it. Run it. -Yeah. -All right. Play calm, calm. Come on, guys. Let's go. Run it. Run it. Run it. Rebound. -Defense. Come on, guys. -All right. All right, let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Give it to him. That's how you pass? -Enough with the sunflower seeds. -What's your problem? When are you going in? It's okay. Don't worry about it. It'll be all right. It's all right. Foul! Foul! Come on. Come on. Defense. Let's go, fellows. Let's go. -Defense. -That's it. That's it. Defense. Block, block. They need timeout. Okay. Timeout. Okay, we're gonna do the 1-3-1. Michael will do the one-three-one, you play left wing. -Okay, let's go. -Let's go. Let's go. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Hands, hands, hands! Good, Michael. Ashdodia cha-cha-cha Ashdodia cha-cha-cha Ashdodia cha-cha-cha Ashdodia cha-cha-cha Yeah, man! All right. All right. I can't believe it. You were great. Okay. Everybody in. Joel, make sure the door-- Don't let anybody in, all right. Sit down. Listen up. Listen up. All right, that's it. This is the first of three. We got two more. An away game on Thursday, an easy one. Monday night, we got a tough one. All right, a home game. Keep it shut just for a second. Keep it shut. I hope you feel the same way. We've got to win this for our new management. Right? -All right. -That's great. Joel, open the door. Open the door. Have you gone insane? Rachel likes you. And you know, she's a pretty big snob. And usually, she hates athletes. Yeah, I know. But she's nice and she's straight too, you know. Yes, she's very straight. How come you never come to New York? What would I do there? Just sit around and be bored. You know what? You should come home with me this summer. Why not? You're making good money now. It'll be fun. There's a good summer league. You could see some great basketball. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. My folks have a house, there's plenty of room. You should come. It'll be fun, I'm telling you. Listen, Michael, are you serious or are you just talking? Yeah, I'm serious. I said I was, didn't I? What's wrong with you? All right. All right. Here, this way. This way. Good, Michael. -Foul. Give him a foul. -Foul. Michael, get back. Michael. This American bastard. He was never worth anything, and he'll never be worth anything. Michael. Michael. Michael. Timeout. Come in. Shit. Damn it. Premier league, premier league, premier league The final game is on Monday. If the other team wins they move up a league. Don't worry, it's gonna be all right. How is it gonna be all right? You're telling me not to worry? We lost a game we should've won. Michael. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. I don't think I've ever played so badly. This has really screwed us up. Michael... ...I've already told you that I don't understand basketball... ...but I know what I saw. I know. I know and I'm sorry. Why are you so sorry all the time? What I saw was an American ballplayer... ...breaking his back in order to beat a half-ass team from some hole in Israel. That's what I saw. -I really did-- -And that's what matters to me. Now tell me, is your contract only for this year? Yeah, I'm going home next year. You're not going anywhere. You're staying here... ...for another year, maybe two. You are going to help me and Joel to build a new team. Afterwards, you can go back to the States with a lot of money. Understand? And we are not going down a league. It's gonna be tough. We are not going down a league. I really admire the way you eat. I always eat a lot, especially after we lose a game and I'm upset. My whole family likes to eat. You should see my brother and father. Joel will tell you about them. You know, he doesn't stop talking about this trip. It's funny because he hasn't even mentioned it to me. What can I say, he talks about it with us all the time. How was the concert? Pretty good. I think I played well and I felt good about it. You look very pretty tonight. Thank you. You must have felt lonely all of a sudden. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did. Thanks for coming. So why did you play so hard to get? I still am. Why? Because of Joel? Partly, yeah. I don't think it's a good idea to date a friend's sister. -And Joel is-- -And what else? And what else? You're scary. Me? Why? So you screwed me, you got dressed and now you're ready to go? That's right. So tell me, Rachel... ...why did you change your mind after hating me? I didn't hate you. Don't exaggerate. I was angry at you. But I think once I saw you at the concert, you looked so handsome... ...and so confused, I decided I wanted you. You can't take a hint. I thought there was something wrong. You always get what you want? No. I wish I did. But most of the time, I do. Anyway, you're the only basketball star I've ever been with. Come on, I'm not a basketball star, give me a break. Joel says you're a star, where you were. Yeah, I was, maybe. Well, that's what's concerned him. If it matters to him, it matters to me. What? That I'm a basketball player? What I want you to know... ...is how much you matter to Joel. I don't think you understand that. I don't think you realize how happy you make him. How much he's changed. The trip to America and everything. He always wanted a friend like you. A basketball player. Star athlete. And they always thought he was just a pest. And he was. I don't know why. He's a great guy. He's really a great guy. And I love him... ...more than anything. Big Oren, and then Michael... -...he needs to throw-- -Enough! Sit down, you talk too much. I can't believe it's the last game tomorrow. Tell me, are you nervous? Not really. I will be tomorrow before the game. What about you? I can't hardly stand it. You don't know what's happening. The whole city is on edge. Yes. Down, quickly! Defense! Defense! Block him! Great! Great! Three seconds! Three seconds! Throw! Take a time-out, Rammie. Okay, okay Go at him! Don't worry, it's gonna be all right. What are you doing? Take it. Drugs. Second pick. Second pick. Foul. Foul. Foul, that's a foul. Guys, lift your heads up, get into the game, we're 8 points behind. Rammie. Rammie, Rammie, hold on just a second. Can I? Do you mind? Go ahead. All right, listen up, guys, look at me. Matti. Matti, hey. Look at me. We have 20 minutes left. Twenty minutes, that's it. These guys are playing rough. The refs are letting them get away with it. Well, goddamn it, we play rough too. The big guy's pushing you all over. Fuck that. He pushes you, you push him. You don't take that shit. Don't do anything fancy. Keep it simple. Basic basketball: you pass, set a pick. Pass, set a pick, that's it. Just basic basketball. Simple. Simple. Simple. Simple. Let's remember where we're coming from, fellows. Remember your pride. Let's kick some ass. -All right. -All right. Let's go. -On three. One, two, three. -Ashdod. Matti! Open it up, open it up! Time out! Foul. Foul. -Who will fuck you, you faggot? -Watch your mouth! Take him out! Time out! Time out! Play ball, fucking asshole. Michael, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's not basketball we're playing. Two throws. You hear me? Foul! Defense! That's right. Play two. Start. We're gonna start pressing right now. We're gonna press full court and play hard. Play hard and look for Michael. Look for Michael. -All right. -We got it, men. -Let's go. -All right. -One, two, three. -Ashdod. -Simchah, hey, where's Joel? -I don't know. He's not here. I can see that. Do me a favor. Go look for him. What are you doing here? Come on. I don't wanna. I can't watch this game. -What do you mean? It's a great game. -Are you crazy? They're ripping us to shreds. Look how my heart's beating fast. So what? Mine is too. Touch it. Come on. Michael took a time-out so I can bring you. -When? Now? -No, two years ago. Yeah, now. Ashdodia! Ashdodia! Ashdodia! Hard defense! Hard defense! Good, Michael, good! Good! Where were you? Michael is having the game of his life. Ashdodia Ashdodia Dodanny, control him. What's this? -Are you all right? -I'm okay. Guys, he's all right. Technical foul. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Ball. Defense! Quickly! Rebound, rebound, rebound. Seven seconds. We won! Yes! What's wrong with you? Come on. Everyone's in the living room. I'll be there in a second. Let me finish eating, okay? I just wanna be alone for a minute. Hey, two more weeks and we're out of here. I spoke to my mother. We'll get there for my brother's wedding. -Wedding? Who's getting married? -His brother. -What are you doing in here? -He wants to be alone. How's the leg? It hurts. When are you gonna come visit me in America? Whenever you say. What do you mean visit? I live there now. Look, look at it. Michael, Michael, come on. We're having a toast for next year. Okay, Joel. Just give me a minute, okay? Give him a minute See, he wants to be alone. He had a thousand people around him. Yeah, so did I. And I want to be alone too. Don't say anything. Now come. He's been working on it every day for a month. Come on. Are you all right? Don't touch him. Mother. Mother. He's fine now. I'm hoping that he'll fall asleep and that will be the end of it. You don't look so good yourself. I'm drunk. Well, you can go home now. He's okay. I want you to come home with me. Will you? Of course, I will. What did you think? Okay, I want to go talk to Joel first. Okay. -I'm gonna go help my mother. -Okay. Hey. How do you feel? I'm okay. So how did I play? That was beautiful. -I'm sorry, you know. -What? What are you talking about? I shouldn't do it. I know it would happen. You feel okay now? Yeah. I told you don't worry. I feel fine. I'm just a little tired, that's all. I'll let you get some sleep. Hey, Michael. Sit here for a minute. Listen. I wanted to tell you that I'm not going with you. I can't. Why not? Because I'm afraid. I'm really afraid to be away from here. You know, I think, I always knew I wouldn't go in the end. I really wanna stay here in Ashdod. This is the best place for me. Tell me, are you going back with Rachel? I don't know. I hope so. I hope so too. Then maybe you'll come back here. No, Joel, I'm not coming back. I'm through playing basketball. You hear that, guys? That's it. You can relax. You know, these guys. They aren't just your dream. They were mine too. Will you send me basketball magazines? I'll send you any damn thing you want.
