Time. Biggest mystery of the universe. It's an eternal engine, and now, we know how to use this force. The last five hours, we've been flying the first plane powered by the absolutely new, super-powerful source of energy. This energy, quantanium, is produced from time. Our plane will fly around the globe at record speed, and we will return to investors and guests. Here with you is the crew captain, the incredible creator of quantanium... Me! Access to aircraft control blocked. Autopilot engaged. We have a problem with the system! I can't control the plane! We're losing altitude and velocity! The switchboard is unresponsive, I can't switch off the autopilot. We're going down fast! Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking! We've been blessed with a unique chance to enjoy a particularly close view of the Pacific Ocean. We're going into the water! What's up with the faces? This is a remarkable opportunity! Take a look at Roderick, now here is someone who knows how to enjoy the moment! My name is Ryan! Ethan, you told me the flight was perfectly safe! And it's true! We are safe while we're flying. I told you we should have carried out the first flight remotely, without the crew! And we'd have lost the plane by now! Luckily, I have an idea. What was that? -I switched it off. -Switched what off? The plane. Ted and, what's your name, brace yourselves! I'm going to turn it back on! Access to aircraft control blocked. Autopilot engaged. The autopilot is still taking us down! Ladies and gentlemen, the captain did everything he could. We have a couple of minutes to live and I'd like to enjoy these moments. Bravo, Ethan! Totally your style! Are we crashing? I can't crash! I have a fashion stream tomorrow! You make your great entrance and leave it for others to pick up the pieces! Ethan, stop this right now! There's an island below us. We're gonna crash! I am Eva Adams. Today, you and I will learn some fascinating things about time. Things you have never suspected. Please welcome the head of "Blake Exploration". An inventor. An innovator. A visionary. Ethan Blake! His brother, Jacob Blake. Commercial director of the company. I've spent my entire life studying time, trying to find an answer to its questions. While time hasn't been kind to you. Your father, Professor Henry Blake, disappeared in 1984, when you were only six years old. He was the first in the world to obtain energy from time. While Ethan put his ideas to work. Today, I will make time work for us! Before you is... quantanium! The most powerful, most efficient and eco-friendly energy on Earth. Here, we have the very first plane that is powered by quantanium! We are about to perform the first nonstop flight around he world, breaking all known altitude and speed records. Our company's chief engineer, Ted Decker. And... others. "How's it going, Eva?" That's stupid. "Eva, you look gorgeous!" Hey, gorgeous, you look Eva! I-I'm Ethan's right hand man! Well, I mean... I'm one of his hands. I... but I do what his right hand does, I mean, he usually does it by himself, but... But I... Come on. I've named this plane in honor of a person I hold very dear to my heart. The person who's been close since I was a child. In honor of my dear friend and colleague, Elizabeth Paulsen. Two days ago, we said our final goodbyes. Elizabeth never liked my work on new sources of energy, she believed they could be misused. Ever since I was a kid, she tried to restrain my craving for invention, and I always found a way to outwit her. And now, I've found a way to do it one last time. Fly with me, Elizabeth. Hey. That's my quantanium. STOP PROHIBITED AREA It's beautiful out here! Don't be afraid! I just want to talk! At gunpoint? It's gone. Come out now! I don't usually carry guns but... But there's shooting out there! You guys are the real deal. No question about that, but... me, I just want to return what is mine. I get it, it's hard to imagine I would end up here. Who are you? Don't look! Sorry. Hard to resist. Well, I'm not made of iron. And you're very beautiful. I don't usually react this way. Hold it! Don't move! Are you seriously pointing a gun at me? Do you have any idea what you're doing? Don't provoke me or I'll shoot! Who are you to threaten me? Who are you? - And you? - Don't move! I can read "Moposova". Turn around and walk that way! Where? Where you'll entertain our security service! Hmm. Honey, you've hit a civilian plane! Don't push me, or I'll shoot-- What now? Not so brave anymore, huh? Damn, you could have hit me! Too bad I missed. Well, go. Go. -Where? -Where? To your accomplices! You will return what is mine and I will forgive you! Walk, walk. Listen, we got off on the wrong foot. You just need to return what is mine, and I won't tell anyone what you're up to. This fog is all over the place. What fog? And I refuse to talk to you. Fine. And how far away are we? We're already there! Okay, I need to go. Time to say goodbye. Come back soon. Jacob. Bye, Daddy. Ethan. I'm gonna be away for a really long time. Two years. Why don't you stay at your stupid work forever! Ethan! -I'll go get him, Dad! -No, no, no. It's okay, Jacob. It's okay. In time, he'll understand. As for now, you must take good care of your brother. And remember this. Whatever you do, always follow through to the end. No matter what or who should stand in your way. Understood? No, no, no, no, no, no! My quantanium! You bastards! You'll pay for every single ounce! Are you okay? Not injured? The quantanium is gone! Oh, we're all right, by the way, thanks for asking. Care to tell me where you were? Soldiers took our quantanium, so I went after them! Soldiers? Damn it. What were you going to do, attack them? Our quantanium has been destroyed! Not only is it three years of my work and all that we have, but the plane will not take off without it! Ethan and Jacob, the Blake brothers! This is my last recording. I give you my murderers! She scratched herself during the crash. - What is that? - My painkillers. Isn't that a little too much? What is this mess I've dragged you all into? I'm a monster! What are you talking about? Um... Mister Blake,... Ted,... Eva... - Um... - What? F-forgive me, please, but you're all here because of me. What? The switchboard didn't go out. I laid the route to this location... and programmed the autopilot to land us here. You idiot! Why did you do that? Because Elizabeth, Mrs. Paulsen, she said that Ethan needed to come here and that we would find something precious! And that... I would have my chance to be... of assistance. That is a confession of an attempt on my life! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on, maybe it's not so bad. If the autopilot landed us, the plane is fine. It won't fly without quantanium, but the emergency beacon would have sent out our coordinates, they will come looking for us! Not exactly. Um, Mrs. Paulsen said that nobody except for us should come here. And so I... dismantled the emergency beacon before we took off, and now nobody knows where we are. You made my daughter an orphan! You made my daughter an orphan! You son of a bitch! They'll never, ever find us now! All right, stop that! You can kill him later! Screw Elizabeth! That's why she talked me into getting you on the test flight! You both set me up! No! I thought that we would find a treasure here! And my mom thought so too! You didn't tell me anything but you told your freaking mother? O... kay! Okay! The thing is, nothing's working. No phone, no radio. We're cut off from the rest of the world. But this place looks like some kind of camp. And there should be a transmitter here. Okay, Rinaldo, try to recall. By any chance, did Elizabeth tell you anything about this place? I'm Ryan... Whatever! That's not what I'm asking! No, she didn't say anything. I didn't even know it was an island. Ethan, we've brought people here. We are responsible for them. I have a more interesting goal. And you call our father selfish? Unlike our father, I'm an honest man. I didn't start a family just to abandon it. TINA MOROZOVA Hello, my dear Matt. It's so sad that the professor couldn't take you to the island as his assistant. I was so looking forward to seeing you here! But on the other hand, I can answer all of your questions in my letters. As you know, our scientific station is top secret, so we won't be alone. Major, I swear not to give away any secrets, and please, don't laugh at all the silly things I'm about to tell my friend. Oh, so this is you. First of all, I must tell you how I've settled here. I have a lovely bungalow house. I'm sure you'd like it. And at night, I can see the constellation of Leo through my window. Your Zodiac sign! And... here I often dream about our meeting. Ethan! Ethan! Today, we are receiving the best scientists and our friends. I want to express my gratitude to all... In my homeland, they laughed at my work, - but you... -What's going on? ...the great people, believed in me! And I did not disappoint you! Today is August 22nd,... 1986. Dad? This day will never be forgotten as the day when the most powerful energy in the world was born! Today, I made time work for us! Whoa! There it is! - Let's-- - Friends! How wonderful it is that you came to my channel! My quantanium! So she's got it! Come on, Rob. I want to finish the movie, Mommy. What if we sing our song as we walk? Sounds good. ♪ How many miles to Babylon? ♪ ♪ Three score miles and ten ♪ ♪ Can I get there By candle-light? ♪ ♪ Yes, and back again! ♪ Are we going to the hospital? Got you, thief! Where is it? I saw you had the quantanium, where'd you put it? Did that make you feel like a Bond girl just now? Who the hell are you? I get it, in the fog, it's hard to make things out, but it's me again. What do you mean, again? Are you kidding? You nearly killed me there! I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, I see, I see what you're doing here. "I don't remember, so it never happened." I've never seen you before! So sincere, you almost got me. Wait, did you really... did you really forget? How could I forget something that never happened? Hey! Where is my quantanium? When did it become yours? -When I created it! -You created it? -Me! -When? In 2019! Tell that to Professor Blake! Wait! What Blake? Henry Blake. He created quantanium. And I hate to break it to you, but it's 1986. Henry Blake? - Wait, he's here? - Don't move, stay where you are! On the ground, both of you! I'll deal with this, and we'll get back to it. - Sir-- - Don't move! I said, stand where you are! There's a tough case here. The girl's a little off, she thinks she's stuck in the past! - Stand still! - You're not wrong. -Get down or I'll shoot! -I'm Ethan Blake! - Get down! - Ethan Blake. Get down, or I'll shoot you! I can show you my ID on my phone! - Get down! Get down! - Look! Look! Look! You have no idea who you're dealing with! I am Ethan Blake's personal bodyguard! And these hands have seen blood! I am an American citizen! My father's a senator! Eva! Did you see that? Everyone's gone! I saw our father, Ethan! He was making a speech. He said it was August 22-- 1986! Yes! That's two years after he left us! Everything disappeared as soon as the fog faded. What was that? Why did he not disappear? He might know what's going on here! Hey! Hey! August 22, 1986, 10 p.m. Interrogation of Tina Morozova is conducted in the presence of Henry Blake. I know you. At around 9 p.m., Ms. Morozova stole the quantanium in an attempt to damage the TAU. The perpetrator has been detained. No quantanium was found on her. How much did they pay you to do this? 200, 300 dollars? Did you plan this with your... lover? I acted alone! You heard the recordings. Matt and I are just pen pals. He's not on the island, and he can't be here! Why did you want to destroy the TAU? I've already told you. Yes, yes, yes, we're all going to die. But it's true! I spoke with soldiers from the future! Millions are going to die, and it's all because of us! This is it, Dad. Now I know what you were up to. One more word, and your rotten tongue will be food for worms! Mother of God! Missing our mommy already, aren't we? Your manners haven't improved since I left. What kind of life do I have here? I know a guy who thinks there's a... treasure... Treasure! This blade could not wait any longer! It's been a while since it touched blood! We spare only women and children! I am a child! Dorothy! I can't believe I didn't notice it sooner! On the Road of Yellow Bricks! Listen, what is this place? We fell down on this island and... You fell down, my dear? Then off you go to bed! I have a few questions. Hey, if you're so smart, answer this question-- How do I get to the testing site? Why is a raven like a writing desk? Changing the subject in someone else's house is poor form! Off with his head! Off with his head! Off with his head! Off with his head! "To my dear son Rob, for his ninth birthday." Come on, Robert. Rob? Is that you? Damn, you're that little boy from the movie theater. Dear Mary. How long has it been since the winds blew you here along with your mother? Rob's mom is acting beyond improper. She comes to the movie theater every night, and she never recognizes her own son! Fog? Ethan, are you there? I'm down here! I'm fine! But we are not! We're in some kind of war zone. EXPERIMENT IN PROGRESS Lima, this is Delta! Do you copy? Delta, report! Have you located the target? This is Delta. Intel confirmed. She hid the quantanium here. Package secured. Give them a visual. We'll take them up to the rocks. Storm the bunker on my signal. That's my quantanium! Quiet! Get down on the floor, now! - Don't move! - Get down on your knees! On the ground! You shall not pass! What was that? And what are these things? I've had enough of your antics! You almost got us killed! What the hell do you want here? If you're so smart, answer this, why is a raven like a writing desk? This looks like an HQ bunker. There should be a transmitter around. Mister Blake, we need to find Eva now! We better call for help before we get killed! Put these on! -No questions. -I'm not putting that on. A whole flock of crows. One of you definitely will squawk too loud! These are loyal hounds, Captain! We can rely on them on our journey! Is Blake's treasure a long way from here? The road is long, rocky and treacherous! Captain, what if someone else will find the treasure? Follow me! I have a radical idea. Just ask this chap if he has a transmitter! The only way to get through to him is by talking in character. He has been stuck here for 40 years with nothing but his books, he's gone off the rails. Captivating story. And how is this going to help us exactly? Whatever it is our father created when he left us, it is also here. You saw this looney dissolve the fog, he must be onto something. Only Gandalf has the power to dissolve this treacherous fog! I guess we're not pirates anymore. Um... Master Gandalf, sir. Where does the fog recede? The fog is the breath of Smaug the dragon. And where is Smaug himself? My faithful companions, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow! Today, I will tell you... a fairy tale! Once upon a time, Henry Blake landed here... to conquer time itself. He wanted to obtain the most powerful energy on Earth. And to achieve that, he had to create something heretofore... unknown! A one-of-a-kind iron dragon that consumes time. The legendary... ...TAU engine! And TAU is the treasure that the wise sorceress Elizabeth sent me here to find! We've found it. Our father's legacy. Never gave her much credit. But... where did the fog come from? It's time for a little press conference! Ladies and gentlemen, Ethan Blake! Thank you, Jacob. You're asking where the fog came from. We have the answer for you! It took us three full years to come up with quantanium, while here, it took them just 20 minutes! Since quantanium was made so quickly, the process had a side effect. This thing that looks like fog to us. It's a mass of processed quantum particles that carry an imprint of events happening on a specific day. An "imprint of events?" What does that even mean? Uh... We have an answer for that. It's like a video recording. Inside the fog, a copy of the day is being replayed. A day in the fog runs parallel to ours. When it's noon here, it's noon there. When it's 8 p.m. for them, it's the same here for us. Hold on, so if these people in the fog are just copies of some day in the past, then how are we able to interact with them? Because it's quantum copies. But the war and the scientists, those are clearly different days! There are two days playing out in the fog. August 22nd, 1986, and the final point of the time wave, August 22, 2036. They were able to produce quantanium so quickly because they were working with a 50-year time wave. ...Mr. Blake, we've tracked the source of the signal, but if we look at the map, there's nothing there but the ocean. Oh, believe me, there's definitely an island here. Waiting for you. The ship sails tomorrow morning, it'll be there in two days, Mr. Blake. - Roger that. Over and out. - Over and out. We need to figure out how the TAU engine works and how to bring it with us. But... but what about Eva? They'll be here the day after tomorrow, I'm sure that they'll find her. You're not planning on looking for her until the day after tomorrow? But she's injured! She could be in danger! That's enough! Stay out of this. Mister Blake. Mister Blake, I dreamed of working for you. But once I got to know you, I realized that you're... you're ready to throw anybody under the bus because you're... an asshole! Here. Elizabeth asked me to give you this once we got to the destination. She said you'd change once you got here. And she was right. Just for the worse. I'll go get him. Ryan! Get down on the floor, now! He's a civilian! - How did you even get here? - Delta, report. Have you located the target? Wait a minute. I've seen him before. We'll take them up to the rocks. Storm the bunker on my signal. Damn, that's him! -I'll kill you, you bastard! -Don't shoot, don't shoot, no! Stop! Are you crazy? It's Ethan Blake! Blake is an old man. What's your name? What's your name? It's me, it's me, me! My... my... my name is Ethan Blake! Leave him, he's a temporal. Even better! I can kill him all over again! Look! They died because of you and your brother! That's my wife and kid! Uh... I don't know them! The UN tried to remove the TAU engine tech from you. That kind of power shouldn't be in the hands of one corporation. So you and your brother decided to start a war with your army of unmanned machines. You've hidden this island from us for years, but we found it. And when we get to the TAU, we'll have a chance of an equal fight! Why are you even talking to him? He's nothing but a bunch of fog! I want him to know what this is for. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't! No! Don't! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan, we'll get you a doctor! Don't you die on me! Hold on! Hold on! - Ethan! - What? It's over. I have to find his mom. Tell her how it happened. Tell her... that I would be dead if it wasn't for him. That he died because of me. No. He died because of me. This is what Elizabeth had feared. Here is the first aid station... where everyone can get the necessary medical help. And over there, we have a whole hospital for more serious cases. Thanks to the generosity of the government, we've built a fully functional-- So what now? You think you won? Well, I have news for you. You're already dead. All of you! Dead! Dead man! Corpse! And you... Are you proud of yourself? But you are just a fog now! A self-centered nothing, as you always were. And I will make a weapon using your energy! Wait! Bring him to my office. You had good intentions, didn't you? Well, I did too! Wow! All it took was one discovery for them to start planting spies. Who sent you? Americans? Brits? Germans? They laughed at me, and now they finally get that they missed out on a genius. Are you having a stroke? Or is this the effect of my discovery? My invention will change the world, my name is already written in history. I'm going to be commemorated. Everywhere. Now I see why I turned out this way. Who cares how you turned out? Exactly. You never cared, for sure. Today I've solved the universe's greatest mystery. Time? Time is infinitely abundant, but... There's never enough of it. You have absolutely no idea. Do you know what kind of force it takes to drag today... To drag today into tomorrow? Incredible force. And today, you made time work for you? I know. All this was written in the notebook you left behind when you left us. What the hell is going on here? You'd understand what is going on here if you'd been there when Mom was dying. Remember? When you abandoned your family, you told your kids to always follow through, no matter what or who should stand in their way. Well, that's exactly what we did. It's how we turned out the monsters we are. Me and Jacob. Uncuff him! I'll talk to him alone. Ethan? But... But how is this possible? You are... a side effect of the TAU engine. As quantanium gets produced, processed quant-particles get released. Yeah. That's right. They get dissolved in the air. No, they don't. They linger in the field, the field that contains events, people... The truth is, you're already gone. Yeah, that means... that means I did it! I really did it! What a striking opportunity! Do tell me. The world must have changed. Is everybody using quantanium? Am I famous? You didn't come back. What? We never saw you again. Mom died, Jacob and I grew up at an orphanage. No! No. Don't be ridiculous! The launch went well! I'll be back soon. I have a travel date, look! Look! Going home in ten days! You never made it back. I should know, it's been my life. What you did here destroyed you and everyone who worked with you. And what I am about to create will cause millions of deaths. No, Ethan, no. You're wrong. Even if that's how it happened for you, it will be different now. I will change everything. Tomorrow, after the committee visit, I'll leave this place. I'll be home in two days! Will you listen to me? It already happened. Us meeting here today... it may have no purpose other than to show me who I have become. - Professor! - What was that? There's a large cloud of fog of some kind. There's something inside it! Stay here, Ethan. Stay here. Hey, Dad! Dad? Wait! Dad! Dad! Get to the bunker! Everyone, to the bunker! The closer the day of the launch, the more anxious I feel. Are we doing the right thing? The professor has changed so much lately. I don't think you'd recognize him. Instead of the dream to improve the lives of all people, he talks more and more about the power and glory that the new energy will give him. I hope I'm wrong. Because if that is the case, I'm not entirely sure that the TAU will make the world a better place. Jacob! We shouldn't take anything from this place! What happened to you? What have you done? Why did you start it? Ethan, we need to carry as much quantanium as we can. It's worth billions. Think about the future of our company. We have to stop this engine! No! I know who starts the war in the future. We do! Blake Explorations! Everything starts today, at this moment. - I saw it! - I believe you. But now we know this, right? We won't let it happen. There's only one way to stop it, by destroying the engine! No. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., the yacht will be here for us. Now we, we'll get out of here and continue our father's work. Dad was killed by our drones. We killed him, Jacob! Quantanium was my dream, you know that! But the time has come to sacrifice it. No, Ethan. No. Always follow through to the end, no matter what or who should stand in your way. Ted, turn it off! Without you, he can't do anything! I'm sorry, Ethan. I have to think about my future. I have a daughter. You know... I'm sick of this. I have the TAU. I have Ted. I don't need you anymore. That's enough! You think I'm going to keep silent? No, I won't! Here, take a look! I saw Ryan die exactly like Ethan said! The engine should be switched off! Stay out of this! Start filming, Ethan! We're going to stop all this. And as soon as we are back online, my millions of followers -will see this! -No, no, no, no! Get back! You better get back! I said, get back! I don't care! Ryan gave his life for me, and you are not going to stop me-- What the hell? Neither am I. I'm not going to stop. Ever. You bastard! That's fine. We'll go and make some quantanium in the meantime. Now... I've become death. The destroyer of worlds. Elizabeth tried to warn me. And I've been so foolish. I spoke with soldiers from the future! Millions are going to die, and it's all because of us! Millions are going to die, and it's all because of us! I've already told you. Yes, yes, yes, we're all going to die. Yes, yes, we're all going to die. ... from the future. Millions are going to die, and it's all because of us! I spoke with the soldiers from the future! Millions of people will die! Why did you want to destroy the TAU? Why did you want to destroy the TAU? I've already told you! I've told you already! Yes, yes, yes, we're all going to die. Yes, we're all going to die. Where did you hide the quantanium? Tell us everything! There's no way I'll tell you! Why did you want to destroy the TAU? Why? Why did you want to destroy the TAU? - I told you already! - I told you already! Yes, yes, yes, we're all going to die. But it's true! I spoke with soldiers from the future! Yes, yes, we're all going to die. I got it now! The quantanium is still on the island. She hid it! The soldiers were talking about it, that means Tina knows where to look for it! Millions of people will die, all because of us! No, no, no! I have a plan! We'll do what Tina wanted. I understand how she planned to destroy the TAU. If you take a vial with quantanium and put it into the engine and start producing new quantanium, their energies will collide, causing an explosion. We'll put Smaug's own egg under his butt! I was in the castle of the sorceress Tina at 8:49 p.m., and I saw that she had already stolen Smaug's egg, which means she left the bunker at about 8:40. We must not break the magic crystals! They won't be able to drive the fog away! Oh, great Gandalf! These crystals repulse the fog, but if you change their polarity, they pull it in. Flee! Down the Road of Yellow Bricks! Hello, my dear Matt. I had no idea that you can miss someone so much. I'm trying to convince the professor that he needs two assistants. We'll see what happens. But while I'm alone, I'll continue to answer your questions. As if we're already together. The professor got approval. I'm flying to America with him! And we'll see each other soon. Over the last six months, you've become like family to me. Although we've never met, and I've never even seen a picture of you. But I'm sure our first date will go down perfectly. It's even better this way. Although we've never met, and I've never even seen a picture of you. It's even better this way. It's even better this way. Hands up! Easy! Easy! Easy? Oh! A foreigner! You want to have a drink? Hey! What the-- What? Did that make you feel like a Bond girl just now? Who the hell are you? We've met before in your dream. Did you forget me so quickly? In my dreams? You told me yourself in your letters. Matt? Is this really you? It is me! I couldn't even imagine I would see you here. They're looking for you. Let's get you to a safe place. Let's hide here! -Matt? -What? This is not how I imagined our meeting. Want to improvise? Matt, listen. I did something. Something they'll never forgive me for. I know. About the quantanium, and everything else. You heard? And I do believe you, and I want to help! Matt... I just don't want to drag you into this. Listen, I'm so glad you're here. But this is such bad timing. We don't choose the time, but we can decide who we are in the time that chose us. We will make things right! We can save the day. They didn't take away the quantanium, did they? No, I hid it. Perfect! I will help you with your plan. Matt, are you sure you want to do this? You admired Henry Blake's ideas so much. He believed that he was changing the world for the better. But he made his loved ones suffer. You are the only one who can change it. I'm here to help! Just tell me where you hid the quantanium. I can get it. They're looking for you, but they won't suspect me. Where is it, Tina? It's in the village. But we can't go now. They're still celebrating, someone will notice me. Well, let's wait here until the morning. How did you talk Henry Blake into inviting you to the island? It wasn't that easy, but I have a way with words. It's like I'm dreaming. Who knows? Maybe it is a wonderful dream. Do you believe in destiny? I guess I do now. I feel so safe with you. Look how wonderful the stars are tonight. Do you see Sirius? The brightest in the night sky. One of the closest stars to Earth. And this is Vega. The sailors are guided by it. It's on the right side of the triangular constellation. It's called the Autumn-Summer Triang... Rob! Rob! Wait, wait! What does he have to do with any of this? Robert! - Tina? - Give it back. Tina, I don't understand. Rob, it's all right, he's a friend. Hold on, you gave the quantanium to a kid? Tina, what are you talking about? Rob, this is no time for joking. At the celebration after the launch, I put the quantanium into your backpack. The launch isn't till tonight. Rob, the launch has already happened! The launch is only about to happen. Crap! Of course! The day in the fog is changing. At... at 4 a.m. So now it's the morning before the launch! Matt, what do you mean? I'm going now, sweetie. I'll see you after the engine launch. Bye, Mom. - Hi, Kate. - Oh, hi, Tina. I almost slept in. Do they really need us this early? No one sleeps, since the professor can't sleep. This is... this is impossible! Calm... calm down! This is impossible! This is... You are not Matt, right? You are not Matt? You are not Matt? Just tell me! I thought it would be better this way. Tina! Stop! Stop! Let me go! I can't, otherwise you'll disappear! How is this even possible? Why am I there? Let me explain everything to you! Is this because of the TAU engine? Did the testing begin? Is this some kind of a system failure? I'm from the future! What? I'm Henry Blake's son. His son? What you have seen in the future, the war, will happen because of me. I didn't know this, and I want to stop it, that's why I lied and told you I was Matt so you would tell me where you hid the quantanium. I'm sorry I lied, I know you hate lies, but I've listened to your recordings, and I almost fell in love. This is impossible! I don't believe a single word! I know it's hard for you to trust me now, but... but I know who you will believe. Who is it? Don't worry. You know him. Let's go. Hey, buddy! I want you to meet someone. Rob's mom didn't recognize him again. And she left without saying goodbye. It's so tactless! ♪ How many miles to Babylon? ♪ ♪ Three score miles and ten ♪ ♪ Can I get there By candle-light? ♪ ♪ Yes, and back again! ♪ Robert! Tina, you recognize me? Yes, of course. I did as you told me. I never, ever opened it. So all of this is true. If Rob got older, then this is the future. But... why did the time get mixed up? Did I travel to the future or... did you end up here? And why is there another me? You didn't travel in time, Tina. You only exist in a mass of processed quantum particles, to me they look like a fog, but you can't see it. Look! This device allows me to attract a field of quantum particles and keep it within a radius of 100 meters. I got you out of the main field, that's why you haven't disappeared yet. The day in the fog started all over again, and... Now it looks like the events have gone back to the morning of August 22nd. That's why you saw another you, the other, before the TAU launch. So I'm like... a ghost? You are a quantum variant, a possible version of yourself. Where did you get this? From my parents. Look. It's the same. It's not "the same". It's the one. What is that? I don't know. Hello, Ethan. If you are watching this, it means I'm dead, and you've found the TAU. Forgive me for luring you here. You had to see everything for yourself. I'm Tina Morozova, assistant to your father, Henry Blake. If you came here, you've seen your father, maybe even me as a young woman. But most importantly, you've seen what our experiments led to. When we launched the TAU, the fog wrapped this place, and within the fog, there was a day from the future, a day of the war. The military destroyed this place, but I was lucky. I survived. Tina Morozova died. Elizabeth Paulsen appeared. It fell into chaos, and... our experiment was forgotten. It was no longer a priority. So, I decided to find you. There was only one way to stop you. But I couldn't do it. Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, buddy! I see that you're an inventor? I wanted to try and raise you a different person. And I think that I've managed to change something in you. You are special, Ethan. So if she... is me... that means I'm already dead. This is such a weird feeling. I don't even know what I am. You are my last hope to destroy the TAU and change the future. But how? Today, my brother Jacob will carry with him off the island the technology for the TAU engine. And it is much more powerful and dangerous than the technology I use to get my quantanium. It's literally a Pandora's box. But what do you plan on doing? I want to finish what you started. I will get to the bunker and draw the fog at the moment of the launch. You've been on site, so you know exactly how it happened. The TAU shouldn't get out into the world. We have to destroy it. All right. But I'll be the one to blow up the TAU. It's personal. Either way, I don't really exist, so... nothing can happen to me. So this means I will vanish soon. There's plenty of time until eight. But I was so looking forward to this day. I even brought a dress with me for the celebration. This sounds so foolish right now. No, it's not. Look, here's a stage. Music. You want to dance? But you and I are alike, Ethan. I know what you're feeling right now. Quantanium was your dream, and now you have to destroy it. I went through this. Realizing that your dream will destroy the world, it's not easy. And I believe that you'll make the right choice. This is all very silly and inappropriate! But your manners are nothing new to me. Mary Poppins is back. Practically perfect in every way! But all good things come to an end. The wind's in the West! People will gather here soon. Let's go to Henry Blake's house. He'll be in the bunker all day. Nobody will disturb us. We'll be docking in a few minutes. Great. You'll find us in a bunker. It's in the middle of an abandoned camp. We're locked in, you'll need to open the metal hatch. We're carrying some precious cargo. Please provide security. And here's the thing... This whole mission, emergency landing, losing quantanium... It affected Ethan. I'm afraid he lost it. There was a terrible incident. He killed the journalist. If you see him, please be careful. Understood. It's time to get out of here. We need to take everything. So, by 8 p.m. we go down to the bunker and put a quantanium flask inside the receiving container. But for this, we need to know minute by minute, where everybody was before the TAU launch. The professor and the committee entered the TAU's control center at 7:30 p.m. and remained there until the launch. All systems were tested, they didn't have a minute to spare. And where were you at that moment? From 7:35 until 7:50, I was near the engine with the scientists. We were preparing the TAU for launch. We'll enter the engine compartment at 7:50. Jacob and Ted will probably try to take out the quantanium. In the bunker, everyone will be busy, so no one will pay attention to them. There's a guard at the entrance. You can't get inside without raising suspicion. But I can. But being the only one near the TAU, I'll be in full view. I can only switch the flasks while the scientists are there, so I have to get there earlier. The main thing is not to be noticed by the second me. Warning. System activated. Clear launch area. Stand by for pre-launch. At 7:55, the TAU will be fully ready for launch. We'll only need to press the button. I'll start the engine to create a distraction. What's happening? Who is it? Who is it? Ring the alarm! And stop Jacob and Ted. Intruders! They got the quantanium! Get them! Get them! After starting up, the engine needs to run for 20 minutes. And throughout this time, no one should get in. I will block the door to the TAU. For good luck. At 20 minutes past eight, the engine will start producing new quantanium. Their energies will collide, and the TAU will be destroyed. Damn it! Ethan's got the key. Jacob, it's over! I put a full flask of quantanium inside the receiver. In 20 minutes, it will explode. What have you done? We need to stop this! Give me the key! You've seen the war! This is what it led to! If the quantanium gets into the world, it will end like this. Either way, we have to destroy the TAU! Listen to me! - On your knees! - On your knees! On your knees! I'll kill you, you bastard! How did you even get here? - He's a civilian! - It's Jacob Blake! Jacob Blake is an old man! -Then he's a temporal! -Wait! You are wrong! No, I recognize you. You'll pay for everything! For what? That's my wife and kid! They died because of you and your brother! Do you see now? We need to put an end to this! This won't happen! It already happened! Look around! Was this our father's dream? Hands up! You want to have a drink? Hold it! Don't move! Grab him! All of this... is because of us! Ted, throw me the gun! Right in front of you! Throw it! Throw me the gun! I have to stop you. For my daughter! I'll fix everything. My name is Ethan Blake. A very wise friend once told me, "Don't waste your time in vain." My whole life, I had a sense of purpose, continuing my father's work, trying to defeat time. But we were both wrong. Destiny is determined by what we strive for. What is the use of victories if there is no one to share them with? The most important thing is the people around us. Family, friends. I only realized this after I lost them all. But every moment in time is a new chance to change everything. Fate is the path to the unknown. I leave it with you. Destroy everything that is left of my work and never return to it in the future. And I... I will destroy the one thing I have here. Dad? Am I in hell? Don't launch the TAU! Don't launch the TAU! Don't launch the TAU! Come closer. A video broadcast from the future. I suggested that, theoretically, the TAU could teleport substances through time, but... teleporting a human? I haven't shown you everything yet. Come take a look! My life's work. So much time wasted... Your family is waiting. I was told you have two boys. Yes. They're a year apart. Wonderful boys. Imagine how happy they will be. And don't tell them that the most important thing in life is to follow through no matter what should stand in the way. How do you know I say that? Just a guess! Don't. ♪ How many miles to Babylon? ♪ - ♪ Three score miles and ten ♪ - ♪ Three score miles and ten ♪ You know this song? I heard it. In another life. ♪ Can I get there By candle-light? ♪ Do you mind? So you said I really helped you. You did. But how did I end up in the future? It's a long story. I can tell you on our first date. I'm sorry, but I already have a date. You've never even met the guy. What if he's not your type? Or married? And I'm here. Single and stunning. Handsome and... humble? Five, four, three, two, one. Ethan! Come here! - Ethan, Jacob! - Can't catch me! - Four, three... - Catch me if you can. That's the biggest snowball I've ever seen! He got you! Hey, be careful, boys. Look at me, Daddy! Mommy, Mommy, look at this! Are you hungry? Now come on, boys. Let's go and get some dinner. Something tells me he won't give up and will continue his research. I think he'll come up with something new. And... what are we going to do? We will look after him. So, how's Matt? Did you finally meet him? Um... Actually... I think he's not my type. Of course. He doesn't know all the World Cup winners for all the years to come.
