(soft dramatic music) (birds cawing) (praying in foreign language) (subdued music) (praying in foreign language) (soft music) (bike tires squealing) - Come on, get up. Sohrab got admission. - I told you he would. Simply, I told you he could do anything. Let him sleep. His admission won't change if he knows it one hour later. ♪ Bless them all, bless them all ♪ ♪ Bless my Sohrab, Darius and all ♪ ♪ Bless my Sohrab ♪ Darius ♪ And Roshan and Dilna, bless them all ♪ ♪ Bless them all - Reign of terror in East Pakistan. Awami League declares Republic of Bangladesh. You know, I told the fellows in the bank yesterday, this is exactly what will happen. Just look at this. Gone mad. No shame, killing babies with bayonets. Even animals behave better. - I wonder what Major would have thought of all this. - Jimmy? - Mm-hmm. - [Gustad] Thought of what? - Everyone saying there's going to be a war. He would have known? - How would I know? He didn't leave us his new address, did he? Or we could have written to him and asked his expert opinion. (speaking foreign language) (horn honking) - Attention. (speaking foreign language) - Bloody municipality. They want to demolish this wall to widen the road. What's the need? Bastards will take half the compound, and this wall will be right in our faces like a mountain with all the shit and piss and road nuisance. (speaking foreign language) - What's the point in... In spoiling your health over something like this, Bossy? Landlord will take the case to court. Court will take minimum 10, 15 years to give a decision. Don't worry. (train horn blowing) (crowd chattering) (siren wailing) (people chattering) (speaking foreign language) - [Man] And now they've started blowing the sirens every morning. I tell you, 100%, there is going to be a war. - Gustad, what do you think? What's this, celebrating the upcoming war? - Sohrab had got into Indian Institute of Technology. - Well done, congratulations. - My son has got into IIT. (people chattering) - Mendasabi, Mendasabi's coming. (speaking foreign language) (people chattering) (upbeat jazz music) - Hold it here. Hold like that. (speaking foreign language) - No, no. Hey come back, come back here. Come back. How much do you want to give? - I thought we'd have a small party. - You bought a live chicken? - My grandmother always said. - [Dilnavaz] Your grandmother had servants to do all the dirty work. - Are we going into poultry farming? - There it is. I wonder where we got this form, Dilna. - I don't know. (chicken clucking) I'm not cleaning up this mess, I'm warning you. - Why are you worried, Dilna. Boarding, lodging is my department. - Everywhere there's a mess. All your books and your newspapers and your stupid blackout paper. Dirt and dust everywhere, and now on top of everything, a live chicken, I'm fed up. - I'm sorry, Dilna, darling. One of these days, we'll make the bookcase, okay, Sohrab? - Sure. (chicken clucking) ♪ You will never grow old ♪ When there is love in your heart ♪ ♪ Time may silver your dark brown hair ♪ ♪ As you dream in your old rocking chair ♪ (humming) (soft music) (children chattering) - Into the hands of the police only, I will put you all, if you bang on my door again. Hey, scrambled eggs. Here, idiot, here. Come on up. I have a rat for you. (chattering) (giggling) - [Kids] Tehmul, Tehmul, Tehmul! - Shh. Hmm. Hmm. (laughing) - What did you think you were doing? (screaming) - [Gustad] What's going on? - Sour scrambled egg. He was supposed the rats to the municipality leader, but he was torturing them instead. - [Woman] The stupid municipality gives him 35 paisa for a rat. - Take them to the municipality yourself. Tehmul, go up. (chattering) - I'll slap your face. (speaking foreign language) - Where's his brother? - He's gone out of Bombay. That's why this idiot is up to his mischief. - Roshan, it's more scared of you than you are of it. Come, come. Come, won't you pet it? - Dilna. - Huh? - See, pet it. Feel, feel. See, there. - Look at that. Look at the expert. The way he holds the chicken. I'm telling you, he'll be the best engineer to graduate from IIT. - What does chicken have anything to do with engineering, huh? - Why are you getting upset? It was just a little joke. - It's not just a little joke. You are driving me crazy with your IIT, IIT, IIT nonsense. - Don't raise your voice at Daddy. We are feeling very happy about it, what else? After hard work in office, he went to market. Two grown up boys in the house and it's a disgrace that your father has to do double jobs. When he was your age, he paid his own college fees and supported his parents. - Daddy, can we keep her forever? (chicken clucks) (knocking on door) (speaking foreign language) - Speak, Dinshawji. Golden Eagle, or rum? - Golden Eagle, if you insist. (mosquito buzzing) - Oh, sorry. This bloody wall has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. - Not at all, not at all. What's a few bites between friends? What's that? Why this black paper? Are you preparing for war or what? - You remember that, war with China? - [Dinshawji] Of course, yeah. But that was nine years ago. - Yes, but it helps the children to sleep better. - Oh, hello, hello, hello. Happy Birthday to the birthday girl. (speaking foreign language) And how's my little bodybuilder? - I'm going to drink the rum if no one wants it. - You sure? You never had it before. - So what? - The aroma of this chicken would make even a corpse in the towers of Thailand sit up with an appetite. (laughing) - Do you see that chicken waiting for us patiently? This morning, it was anything but patient. - [Dinshawji] You mean you brought it home alive? - Of course. My grandmother always said, slaughter fresh, cook immediately, then see the test. - Can you please explain later (laughing) after we eat? - Oh, sorry, sorry. - No, no, no. Wait, everybody. A toast, huh? - Food is getting cold. - One minute. - I wish you health, I wish you wealth, I wish you gold in storm. I wish you heaven on earth. What can I wish you more? (laughing) - [Gustad] Oh, nobody move. Must be fuse or something. I'll just get my torch. (chattering) Yes, yes, Tehmul, yes. Whole building is dark? (chattering) - Everything dark, dark, dark, dark, dark. - Okay, Tehmul. Okay. Now, be careful. Don't fall. (chattering) - Ghost to left of them, ghost to right of them, ghost in front of them, hungry and thirsty. - Light or no light, I have one wish to make. For Sohrab, my son, my eldest. To you, good health, good luck, and may you do brilliantly at IIT. Make us all very proud of you. - Hear, hear. ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow - Stop it! - Food will get cold. - What's the matter all of a sudden? - It's not all of a sudden. I am sick and tired of your IIT, IIT, IIT all the time. I am not interested in it, I am not a jolly good fellow about it, and I'm not going there. - I told you not to drink the rum. - Fool yourself if you want to. Rum or no rum, I am not going to IIT anyway. - Say why. If you have a good reason, I will listen. Speak. Becoming mute helps nothing. - IIT was never my idea. You made all the plans. I told you I want to change to the arts program. I like my college and I love my friends there. - Friends? Are they going to give you a job when you graduate with a worthless BA? Idiotic lunatic talk. Learn from my experience. Where is our great friend Jimmy Bilimoria now? Used to come here all the time. Ate with us, drank with us. Where has he gone now? Gone without a word like a thief in the night. That's friendship for you. Worthless. Meaningless. Present company not included, of course. - Who wants to make a wish? (thunder rumbling) (subdued music) - Please, don't blame me for your stupidity. - Stupidity? You're using that word to your father? - Yeah. - No fighting, huh? - I know I'm talking to my father, but my father does not want to know the truth when he hears it. - You first suffer like your parents, then talk about truth. Nobody paid my college fees. I had to earn them. - Papa, I've had to listen to that story a hundred times before. How much you suffered and sacrificed, and how your father lost all the money. - Roshan, bring my belt. - [Roshan] No. - I'll teach that brother of yours a lesson in respect. Say now what you have to say. Let us hear your genius talk if you still have the courage. - I've already said what I wanted to. If you didn't hear, I can repeat it. - Ow! Gustad, what are you doing? - I'm warning you. Tonight, I don't care what happens. I'm going to cut your son to pieces. - Stop it. - Coward. Why are you hiding behind your mother? 17 times I've told you not to come in the middle when I'm dealing with the children. - [Woman] Enough is enough. This is sleeping time, not fighting time. Save the rest for morning. - Come to my door and speak if you have something to say. I'm not living free here. I also pay rent. See how your friend behaves? Sally witch. - She's right. All this shouting and screaming in the middle of the night. - Oh, very nice. Take her side against your husband. Always against me only. (subdued music) (thunder rumbles) - Study hard, Sohrab. - Behave yourself in your new school. - [Bus Driver] Bus will only stop at the next stop. Buy a ticket or get out. - Come on, Dad. Let's go. - Sohrab! (horn honking) (tires squealing) - Jimmy, what happened? Shouldn't we take him to a hospital? - Take him to a regular hospital, he'll get regular treatment or regular mistreatment, depending on his luck. I'll send for Marivata bone setter. Great chap. No pins, no operation, no cost, nothing. Thank you. (subdued music) My dear Gustad. This letter must come as a big surprise to you. I know you are very angry with me because of the way I left, without even a word of goodbye. Will you, and Dilnavaz, and the children please accept my sincere apologies? And believe me when I say I had no choice. I'm still not at liberty to give you the details except it is a matter of national security. Something relating to my assignment needs to be done in Bombay. I immediately thought of you since there is no one I trust more. It just involves a parcel which I would like you to receive on my behalf. Please, let me know. Someday I will tell you the whole story when our family is together again. Your loving friend Jimmy. (siren wailing) - [Dilnavaz] We saw the letters. - Who's we? For me, you're the only one present here. - You've started hiding mail. I wonder what else you're hiding. - Nothing. I just wanted to think about Jimmy's letter without getting a thousand suggestions from all the geniuses in this house, that's all. - Thousand suggestions. For 21 years we discuss everything together. Now, I'm a nuisance. And Jimmy doesn't even tell the details. How do you know you're doing the right thing? - But details don't matter. I'm helping a friend. That's what matters. I really don't understand you. All this time it was Jimmy this, Jimmy that. I said forget about Jimmy, he's vanished like a thief. But no. Now, he asks for help, I say yes, and you're still not pleased. - [Dilnavaz] What if it's something dangerous? - Don't talk rubbish. He only wants some parcel picked up, that's all. Why is this one grinning like a donkey? - Don't get upset again, Daddy. I think you made the right choice, but-- - Oh, he thinks Daddy made the right choice. You haven't told him yet he's no longer my son? Thank you, sir. Thank you for your approval. Go on, but what? - You know how Jimmy Uncle used to say, "Only two choices, Communism or military dictatorship. "If you want to get rid of these crooks, "forget about democracy for a while. No good for a starving country". (laughs) Now imagine... Imagine if Jimmy Uncle is planning a coup to get rid of our corrupt government. - Why don't you imagine something useful like IIT? All this idiotic lunatic talk. What Jimmy Uncle used to say is just a way of speaking. Be grateful you live in a democracy. If the Russia wala was here, he'd pack you and your friends straight off to Siberia. Really. When he talks like this, the blood in my brain begins to boil. If I get a stroke, it will be your son's fault. I'm warning you. - Into the hands of the police only we should put you. When they break your arm, then we will see how you add water. - As if I make the milk. Cow does it. - Why don't you sell the milk and water separate? Better for the customer, easier for you, also. No more mixing, fixing to do. - I own cow. Molly gives me the milk. It's my job. Go south on Molly. Why on me, huh? Go, go. Please, go. Mixing, fixing. - [Dilnavaz] I'm so sorry about last night. Gustad was very upset. Please, don't take it to mind. - That's not why I called you up. I'm worried about Sohrab. He reminds me so much of my nephew Fahrab. Such a brilliant boy. He would've inherited his father's practice had he lived. - I'm so sorry. - No. Why is Sohrab behaving like this? - I don't know. My mind refuses to work when I try to understand. - Suddenly, he does not want to go to this IIT place? And up to now, nobody forced him, he wanted to go. - I think it was his own idea when he was just a boy at school. But. - Do you know anyone who would profit by Sohrab's failure? Someone who would steal his brain for his own child's sake maybe? - I can't think of anyone. - Many ways exist to do such black things. Don't worry. I'll help you. Start with a lime. - Close your eyes. - [Sohrab] What's all this? - It's not going to hurt. Just makes your brain healthy. - What nonsense. My brain doesn't need any help so far. - Shh, quiet. It's bad to have too much pride. Lots of things science cannot explain. - Oh, yeah cannot explain. - Close your eyes. - Yeah, yeah, okay. First, Daddy gets dramatic and then you get necromantic. The two of you are driving me completely crazy. - Don't be rude. And don't use big, big words. We all know you are very clever. Okay, now open your eyes. Look at it. Don't move your head. (horn beeping) - Why change the name? What is wrong with Flora Fountain? - Why worry about it? If it makes the Schiffs and the Gondas happy to rename a few streets, let them do it. What's the matter? - Hey, Gustad. You are wrong. Names are so important. I grew up in Lemmington Road, but it has disappeared. In it's place is Dada Separkimama. My school was at Karnak Road. Now suddenly, it's Lokmanya Tilak. I live at Sleater Road. Soon, that will also disappear. So, what happens to the life I led? Was I living the wrong life with the wrong names? (horn beeping) Oh, my god! (tense music) Well, Gustad. All these years I've known you, I didn't know blood would make you sick. - Oh, don't be silly. I know that man on the Labretta. He helped me when I had my accident. - But I thought it was Major who took you to-- - No, no, no, that was later. He was the taxi driver who took care of Sohrab and me. Took us home. Didn't even charge for it. For nine years I've waited to thank him. Today was my turn to help him and I failed the test. - Ah. - A test set by God and I failed. - Oh, nonsense. It was not your fault. Drink this, you'll feel better. (speaking foreign language) What a body, huh? Sugar and cream. What fun it would be to give her a mutton injection. (laughs) - Mr. Noble, your daughter's school phoned. Nothing to worry about. She won a doll in some raffle. They want you to come pick it up after school. - Ooh. (speaking foreign language) - Have you hurt yourself, Mr. Dinshawji? (laughs) - Mister, mister, mister. Mister, mister, mister. Please, please, please, please. Please sign, please sign. - First others, then me. - Let the gentleman take his doll out first, then do all your talking. - Mama. Mama. Can I touch this? - No! - Don't be like that, Roshan. - [Roshan] His hands are dirty. - Please, please, please, please. (chattering) - All right, once only. - Mommy. - You won? - [Roshan] Yes. Her eyes open and close and she says mama. - Oh, really? Gustad, Jimmy's letter has come. It's over there. Ooh, lovely stockings. They might fit you. - [Roshan] No. - No? It's gonna get so dirty. Let's take them off and put them in the cupboard. Okay? - Yes. - Then they won't get spoiled. Come on. Beautiful. (singing in foreign language) (people chattering) - [Jimmy] My dear Gustad. Overjoyed to hear from you. It would be too much to bear if our friendship was lost. I can now tell you that I am working for R-A-W, training the freedom fighters in Bangladesh. Just returned from the border zones. Not a pretty sight. I've seen the atrocities with my own eyes. I tell you, Gustad, this new breed of Pakistani butchers is something else. But let me get to the main point. All you have to do is go to the book section of Kuul Bazaar. I've told my contact to display prominently the complete works of Shakespeare. Open the book to Othello, end of Act One, scene three. The line, put money in thy purse will be underlined in red. My man will give you a parcel. I'm sure you'll recognize him. You met him once many years ago. - Mr. Noble. Good to see you again. - You remember my name. For nine years I've waited to thank you for your kindness. (speaking foreign language) - Come. And how is your hip? - Almost good as new, thanks to you. That day of my accident, you and Major Bilimoria in the taxi. You never said... Did you know him in those days? - Yes, I knew him. Sometimes, though, we have to pretend because of the kind of work we do. Come, sit down. - Your accident, I saw it happen. How are you now? - Oh, it was not really an accident. They were aiming for my scooter. - Really? Who do you suspect, Pakistani spies? - (laughs) Nothing so simple. You can just say occupational hazard. (speaking foreign language) Have some tea. Thank you. - You know, I'll never forget your face. Sorry, I can't remember your name. - Ghulam Mohamed. - Yes, Ghulam. I remember you telling my son in the taxi. - And how is Sohrab? - Oh, you remember his name even? - Of course. How can I forget? Major Bilimoria has always talked to me about your family. Says it's like his own. Even before your accident I knew all about you. Any friend of Billy Boy is a friend of mine. - Billy Boy's a nice name for Jimmy. You two joined RAW at the same time? - Yes. Wherever Billy Boy goes, I go. He can always depend on me. His friend is my friend. And his enemy has to answer to me. Whoever harms him, I go after him. Whatever it takes. Knife, gun, my hands, my teeth. (chuckles) - He's very lucky to have a friend like you. You'll never guess who I met at the bazaar today. - You're not going say Jimmy Bilimoria. - No. You remember the taxi driver who brought me home when I had my accident? Him, Ghulam. - What is all this Jimmy has sent? - This is from Jimmy, those are four beautiful books. (Dilnavaz gasps) (gasps) Tehmul. Tehmul, come here. Come, come. (chattering) See? No knife. - So much, huge. - The money you saw is your and my secret. - Secret, secret, secret, secret. - Secret means nobody must know what you saw. You understand? - Nobody, nobody. Secret means secret. - Will you tell anybody what you saw? - No, no, no. No, secret, secret, nobody. (chattering) Two piece, two piece. Secret, two piece. - You know what I'll do if you tell anybody what you saw? I'll take my knife and I'll cut your throat like the butcher cut the chicken's neck. Remember. - Secret, secret, secret, secret. - 10 lakh rupees. - My god. - Nice smell. - Very nice. For 24 years I've lived with that smell in my nose. Never tired of it. Dear Gustad. Deposit the money in a bank account. Since you are a savings supervisor, it would be easy for you to avoid the rules and regulations about large deposits. I'll send more instructions when necessary. Your loving friend Jimmy. P.S., forget Lago's advice. 10 lakhs won't fit in your purse. (laughing) I was wondering why he chose that line. - Forget your wondering and help me pack this. - But you don't understand. This money is for the Bengali resistance. - I hope by now it's got into your brain that this is not some childish game. Unless you want to do dangerous, illegal things and lose your job. - Yes, but what about Jimmy? Do you have any idea what dangerous work he's doing in RAW? - It's his job. He joined the Secret Service. Let him do his own secreting and servicing without us having to starve to death. - But I gave him my word. I told him in my letter that he can rely on me. - Tell him that you were transferred to another department. Different duties, so you can't do deposits. - You're right. That way he won't feel that I let him down. - Exactly. (knocking on door) - Who is it? - It's me Sohrab. Hello. Daddy robbed his bank. - Warn your son right now. I'm in no mood for his senseless jokes. - Money is from Major Uncle, but we're sending it back. It's too risky for Daddy. - I'm really surprised why Major Uncle joined RAW. Our wonderful prime minister uses RAW like the KGB to do all her dirty work. It's a well-known fact. - Again with the idiotic lunatic talk. Rubbish about the prime minister you're talking when you don't know anything. - Jimmy Uncle says this is government money, right? So, instead of depositing it in your bank, let's use it for all the things the government is supposed to do. Install the water tanks, repair the sewers, clean the gutters. - Shut up. Talks like a crazy rabid dog. My own son. Changed so completely. I can hardly recognize him. Who would've thought he'd turn out like this? Remember, I kicked him once to save his life and I can kick him again. Out of my house this time. Out of my life. (subdued music) Ghulam said he's away for a week. I'll take him a note. When he comes back, I'll return the money. (tense music) - A while ago a gentleman with the good name of Shrieb, no Candyland. Mr. Iram Ghough came to me wearing his money. He's wanting most expensive and undiluted Pantone. So, I make him super deluxe bed breaker pon. He goes inside. That one there. One whole hour. Poor lady. He's going it's all good, it's all good. Lady finished. Gentleman still standing. Shameful. She departed. - Uh, this is for Ghulam Mohamed. - Yes, yes, yes. - He said that-- - He'll get it. Gentleman still standing. Second lady coming. One more time. It's all good, it's all good. (door opens and closes) (grunts) - Your son has left home. - What is it to me? (subdued music) (birds cawing) (grunting) (rattling) (birds cawing) (tense music) - Oh, my god. - What's going on, Bossy? Somebody's knife is very sharp, huh? Anyone has a grudge against you? - Don't they kill animals for black magic? (chattering) - Hey! (yells) - It was in the bush. (speaking foreign language) - Oh, my god. Jimmy. - Yeah. - [Dilnavaz] But to us? Maybe the taxi driver had-- - Well, that makes no difference. - I think we should take the money and go straight to the police. Tell them the whole story. To hell with Jimmy Bilimoria. We'll tell Inspector Bamji. - But you don't understand. Inspector Bamji, the police, have no power over RAW. We are in the hands of heartless people. Poisonous snakes. That could've been Darius or Roshan instead of the cat. There's only one thing to do. Don't worry, I'll be careful. After 24 years in the bank, I know the place and the procedures inside out. Two bundles a day I'll deposit. I don't understand this world anymore. First, your son destroys our hopes, now this rascal. Like a brother he was to me. What a world of wickedness it has become. - What a world of wickedness it has become, Gustad. How could my own brother cheat me, ruin me? I failed you, my son. Can you forgive me? - Tears are for women and for men who are weak. Not for me. - [Dinshawji] Someone had to do something about those bastards. - [Gustad] Exactly the way I feel. - If this money is for the government, why all the secrecy? Why doesn't the government deposit the money using normal channels? - You don't understand. Even within the government there are people ready to sabotage the Bengali resistance. Wheels within wheels, Dinshu. - Ah. It is not for us to reason why, it is for us to do or die. - Yeah. - [Dinshawji] Let me have the bundle. (tense music) - Mrs. Noble? Mrs. Noble? I'm Sister Constance. She's had shivering, high fever. - Roshan, darling. Are you all right? - [Dinshawji] Oh, Laurie. One day I want you to meet my little Laurie. - [Laurie] I would love to. - Such fun the two of you will have together. - [Man] Mr. Gustad, Madon wants to see you. - Noble, you know the rules. No personal calls in office. - Hello? Huh. Hmm. Okay. Okay, bye. That was my wife, sir. My daughter's not well. High fever. Could I leave a little early today? I have to take her to the doctor. - Why can't you go after office hours? Leave at four. Don't make this a habit. (uptempo drum music) (people chattering) - I won a big doll in raffle. She has a wedding dress. - Oh, we must then find her a bridegroom. A nice young Parsi boy. Fair and handsome like me. You don't think I'm fair and handsome? - No. - [Gustad] What is it? - Not diarrhea. Though, sometimes a simple case of diarrhea can be very troublesome. Look at East Pakistan. A simple sickness, but very difficult to cure. And that quack, Dr. America feeding the virus. So what is the cure? - What is wrong with her? - What is wrong with our city? Overflowing gutters, unsanitary water, mosquitoes, people urinating and defecating here, there, everywhere. And the municipality couldn't give a damn. - I know what's wrong with Bombay. What's wrong with her? - Probably malaria. - [Gustad] He said maybe malaria. (plate clatters) - Now are you satisfied? Now you'll admit it? I repeated it till I was exhausted. Till my lungs were empty. But you treat my word as if a dog was barking. - [Gustad] That's right, blame me. That's the easiest thing. - [Dilnavaz] Better than who, your dead uncle? Did you buy the repellent? Did you? This whole building needs mosquito repellent because of that stupid wall and you can't even get it for your own family. - [Gustad] You know how much the repellent costs? - [Dilnavaz] You have money for live chickens, but you have no money for repellent. You Nobles think you know everything. - That's right, you blame my father, my grandfather, and my great-grandfather as well. Blame me for everything. - It is your fault. - It's my fault Sohrab isn't going to the IIT? What is it? - I don't like when you fight. - No one's fighting. We're just talking. - You're shouting and angry. - You're right, my bubka. We were shouting, but we're not angry, you see. Look, is that an angry face? - Go ahead and kiss Mom. - Later, but I'll kiss you now because you're closer. - No. I can't sleep till you kiss Mommy. (speaking foreign language) - Not like that. That's not a Daddy and Mommy kiss. Eyes closed properly. (subdued music) - Morning, Bossy. Hope you said a nice prayer for me, yeah. - Of course. Crime's calling you very early today. - Say a prayer for the wall also, huh? - Hey! (speaking foreign language) You notice how much worse it is all the base, and stink, and mosquitoes? - What to do? Every sister fucker with a full bladder comes here, takes out his Laurie, and pisses. (speaking foreign language) (subdued music) (speaking foreign language) - Can I ask something? - You can ask me anything. But I don't paint bathrooms and I don't do personal portraits. - No, no, no. I know a good place. A big wall outside my building. Why don't you set your business up there? - Why should I? I like it here. - Every day, your drawing gets rubbed out. Again you have to start. There you won't have this problem. Your drawing will be permanent. - Sir, all life's problems begin when we look for permanence. - Up to you. Go to that building by Kalah. - [Artist] I know it. - The spell has gone so deep inside Sohrab. The lime cannot pull it out. When the spell goes so deep, it takes another human being to take it out. - [Dilnavaz] How to do that? - There is a method. Instead of throwing the limes into the sea, squeeze the juice and give it to somebody to drink. That way the spell will pass from your family into that other person. - That means that someone else will have to suffer. - Yes. I myself don't like it, but it is the only way. - Who can I give it to? - Give it to Tehmul. - I couldn't do that. Maybe I should drink it myself. After all, Sohrab is my son. - Stop talking nonsense. First, Sohrab leaves home, now Roshan is at death's door. How long will you wait? Anyway, you will be doing that idiot a favor. How much brains does he have? For the first time in his life he will be of use to someone. (yells) - Tehmul. Tehmul, come. Look what I have here, Tehmul. Tasty juice. Don't do that, Tehmul. Here, drink. (sniffs) (laughs) - Yum, yum, yum, yum. - Okay, drink all. - Give me more, please. - Not now. Next time. - Look, Gustad, look. Laurie's such a brave girl. She's not afraid of my big naughty snake. (laughing) - Dinshawji, bring your ledger into my office. (subdued music) - Mr. Noble, may I talk to you sometime today? - Uh, you can talk to me now, Ms. Coutinho. - I prefer to talk privately. Are you free for lunch? - Yeah. - Everything A-OK, partner. (people chattering) (uptempo music) - Huh. I wonder why they want to put the waiter under the table. (laughing) - You have a sense of humor. Just like your friend Mr. Dinshawji. - We better order something. Ready? Let me ring for the waiter. Oh, so sorry. (buzzer buzzing) - It's all right. (knocking on door) - Yes, yes, come in. - Yes, sir? - What'll you have? - Tea, please. - Two teas and two mawa cakes. - Please, sir. In exactly seven minutes with your food I will return. I will be knocking on the door. Then afterwards, you will have complete privacy. - Has a one-track mind. - Not his fault. It's a one-track room. - Now, what was it that you wanted to see me about? - The problem is your friend Dinshawji. I don't know if you heard, but he keeps telling me he wants me to meet his Laurie. At first, I thought it was his daughter or niece. You can imagine how I felt when I found out that the word means a man's private parts in your Parsi language. He's ruined my own name for me. - No, don't say that. Laurie's a beautiful name. That will never change just because of some silly slang word. - The rubbish he talks. He was telling me that he works for the Secret Service. That he is in charge of 10 lakh rupees to fully equip the Bengali resistance. Can you imagine that? Mr. Dinshawji in the Secret Service. - Secret Service wouldn't hire him to clean the toilets even. (Laurie laughs) - Anyway, I was going to complain to Mr. Madon, but I thought before I do that I should speak to you. - Please, don't speak to Mr. Madon. Dinshawji is two years away from retirement. He's also very sick. I'll speak to him, I promise you. I'll make sure he never upsets you again. Luckily she doesn't believe all that Secret Service rubbish. She was laughing when she was telling me. But what if it should reach Madon's ears? What if he discovers about the deposits? What'll we do then? Bloody fool. - What can I say? You're right. I am stupid idiot. What to do? - It's in your hands. If you stop bothering Laurie, she won't go to Madon. - [Dinshawji] Of course I'll stop, but-- - But what? - If I suddenly stop fooling with her, won't people find that strange? - I've thought about that. I have a plan. Now, you have to stop your teasing and joking with everybody and I'll spread the story that your health is not good again. That you're feeling under the weather. - I'd prefer to be feeling under Laurie's skirt. - Will you stop it? - Sorry. - Smooth black stone. Perfect for your pictures. And it's 60 feet long. It's a nice locality, also. A lot of rich people pass by every day. - But it stinks very much. - That's true. Shameless people use this wall like a lavatory. But with your holy pictures, no one will dare. (speaking foreign language) - [Tehmul] Attention! - Shh, shh. Shh.

Sohrab. - Coming. (knocking on door) Sohrab? Sohrab, where are you? Are you all right? Come back home immediately. Enough is enough now. Wait. - So, he's not coming back. Dangerous diseases need dangerous cures. (Tehmul chattering) - Oh, what big nails you have. Don't you ever cut them? Come, I'll cut them for you. No, Tehmul. Nothing will happen. Not nice to have such long nails. All dirt collects inside. - No. - Okay, then no juice. No cutting nails, no juice. Tehmul. There. Nothing happened. - [Tehmul] Juice, juice. - No, no, wait. Must do toes, also. (subdued music) - Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. - [Gustad] Nice smell. - Oh, yes. Incense sticks. I have regular customers now. - What about money? You have enough? - Oh, yes. This is a very good location. New clothes. Turtling pants. Latest fashion, me. Seven belt loops. Very nice shit. Feel it, feel it. Drip dry. No more ironing, shining. - Dinshawji? What brings you here? - Dinshawji's been waiting for you, Gustad. Got something important to say. - Speak, Dinshawji. I'm ready. Are you crazy? You didn't deposit? - Please read. You'll understand. (Gustad grunts) - [Dilnavaz] What's the matter? Are you all right? - Of course I'm all right. It's Jimmy. Arrested on charges of fraud, extortion. - He impersonated the prime minister's voice and instructed the chief cashier to hand over 60 lakh rupees. He has confessed. - Believe me, Dinshawji. I had no idea. If I had known, I-- - There is no question of that. There is no doubt in my mind about you at all. - He lied from the beginning about everything to me. - Yes, yes, Gustad. But we can't change that now. What's happened has happened. Now, we have to think about what to do with the money. - Well, I don't know! - Dinshawji's right, Gustad. - First of all, I think we should stop depositing it. - [Dilnavaz] I just can't believe that our Jimmy would do something so crooked. - People change. (people chattering) - [Man] Hello, gentlemen. - I want to leave a message for Ghulam Mohamed. Tell him-- - Tell him yourself. He's waiting for you inside. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - Mr. Noble, come in. Billy Boy has enemies. This whole story was cooked up by people at the very top to cover their own crimes. You have to trust him. - I've trusted him too much already. - So far, Billy Boy hasn't named any names. But how long can he hold out? Do you know the tactics they use to make you talk, Mr. Noble? For his sake and yours, you must return the money immediately. - I've already deposited half. You can have the other 50 bundles anytime. - All of it this week. - Do you know how difficult it is to withdraw such large sums of money? How dangerous? Laws have been broken. - Better than bones being broken, Mr. Noble. (people chattering) (Tehmul chattering) Get out! (speaking foreign language) - [Gustad] What is going on? - They're not letting me, they're not letting me. All money gone, gone, gone. All money gone, gone. (chattering) So much money gone. Sorry, sorry. (tense music) - Thank you, Dinshu. I don't know how to thank you enough. So much you've done for me. You all right? (speaking foreign language) (tense music) (people chattering) (train horn blows) - What's the matter, my bubkalu? What happened, you paining somewhere? Huh? No? Dilna? - Her doll is lost. I can't find it anywhere. - [Gustad] Then say stolen. Where did you leave it? - On the sofa. Um, your office phoned. Dinshawji collapsed at work. They've taken him to Parsi General. Did you return the money? - Yes. Come, a little more. - Later, I'm full. (speaking foreign language) (laughing) Only if you have some, also. - Okay, okay. Okay. Come. - I'm full. Have you seen the night nurse? A real foto carro. The lady with the lamp. She can borrow my candle any time when her lamp is out of order. - Shh, shh. (laughing) ♪ Oh, give me a home where the nurse's hands roam ♪ ♪ Where they all have big beautiful tits ♪ ♪ Where seldom is heard an encouraging word ♪ ♪ And the patient is treated like shit ♪ (laughing) - She may not appreciate your poetry. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (subdued music) That's new, isn't it? - Huh? Yes. Mount Mary Church, Bandra. Miracles happening every day. The statue of the Virgin Mary actually shedding real tears. - You believe that? - See, I don't like to weaken anyone's faith. Miracle, magic, trick, coincidence. What does it really matter? As long as it helps. Huh? (subdued music) - Is that allowed? - Don't worry. Someone will do the same to yours. - Please, make Roshan healthier. Please, help my friend Dinshawji who's suffering a lot. And help my son Sohrab to see better sense. Don't worry about my hip, it's not that important. - Gustad, wait. Ghulam has come to see you. - Hello, Mr. Noble. - Last time I made it clear. I don't want anything more to do with you or Major Bilimoria. - I'm sorry to disturb you and your wife. I wanted to show you something about Billy Boy. See for yourself. They've killed the investigator who was investigating his case. No extent. Now just a matter of time before they finish him off. - You keep saying finish him off. This is not Russia or China. - [Ghulam] I don't know how to convince you, but-- - Does it matter whether he sees me? He never cared for me. Lying and using me for-- - You're wrong. He did care. He made sure you did not get into trouble after his arrest. Mr. Noble, go visit and say final goodbye to your friend. Please. If he has any hope, please don't destroy it. - Okay. (speaking foreign language) - Parsi General phoned. - Dinshawji? - About one hour ago. - There was no miracle for Dinshawji. - [Dilnavaz] You tried your best. It's not your fault. - It is my fault. I silenced him. - It's all right if the tears come. (singing in foreign language) - Oh, so beautiful. I kept listening. I know you think I'm crazy, but. - Continue. - There was a smile on Dinshawji's face. Go on, say I'm crazy. - Prayer is a very powerful thing. Prayer can put a smile on Dinshawji's face or in your eyes. - I hope when I die there's a smile like that on my face and in your eyes. (dramatic music) (gate opens) - [Jimmy] Gustad? - Yes, Jimmy. - [Jimmy] Gustad. - It is Gustad. - Gustad? She... She. - [Gustad] Who? - Prime minister. She chose me to train for supplying arms. - Bengali resistance. - Great soldiers. (gate closes) Gustad. Gustad, stop. Oh, no. No, stop, stop. (tense music) (grunting) I went there to see for myself. They were in rags. No money. Barefoot. No ammunition. Something wrong. Somewhere money for supplies are being rerouted by prime minister into her private bank account. - Are you sure? - Wish I could say no. All day and all night I thought on it. I went crazy thinking about it. Thought of those bloody bastards. Those bloody buffaloes, pigs, getting fatter. Fatter every day sucking our blood. I decided if they can profit, why not us? Why not us? I put aside 10 lakhs for you. For your family. Ghulam said you were so angry. Ghulam told me. Gustad, do you forgive me now? (subdued music) Please, forgive me. - I love you, Jimmy. There's nothing to forgive. - Thank you, Gustad. Thank you for everything. - [Radio Announcer] This is Lonindary Joe. We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a message from the prime minister. - [Prime Minister] I am speaking to you at a moment of great peril. Some hours ago at 17:13 Indian Standard Time Pakistani aircraft bombarded our airfields. At Ambrikson, Pathankot, Srinagar, and Amla. We have no other option but to put the country on a war fatigue. At this hour, I appeal to all Indians to stand together. Jai Hind. - Fahrab? Where are you, Fahrab? (laughing) Dilnavaz, you may wait outside. Tehmul, you want to have some fun? - Yes, yes, yes. Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun. Having fun, fun, fun, fun, fun. - Then sit down and concentrate on that glass. (chittering) It's very dangerous to look at it when it's burning. You could lose your mind like that. (Tehmul yelling) (uptempo music) - [Gustad] This is what I call a miracle. - Your idea, sir. Great idea. This location is the best in the entire city. - No, no, no. Credit goes to your talent. - [Artist] Look. - You painted our wall? - Of course. It's a sacred place now, isn't it? - [Tehmul] Fire, fire. (bell clanging) - The fire was put off hour an hour back. Towering inferno. Many huge fire, you know. Whole building. Whole street burned almost to the ground. - [Woman] The stony wall must've protected you. - It wasn't such a big fire. (laughs) - How are you, my sweetu? - Hungry. - Hungry? - Yes. (siren wailing) (moaning) (laughing) (explosions booming) - Anti-aircraft guns. Ours. - Pakistani bombers must be coming. - Oh, God. I hope Sohrab is safe. - Of course, he's safe. He's not such a fool as to be standing on the street. Anyway, our guns will chase the Pakistanis away. Ow! (laughing) I'm just going to see if all the lights are off. - No, Gustad. (explosions booming) - Tehmul! Tehmul! Put your clothes on. At once. - Please, please, forgive me, forgive me. Please, Gustad. I'm sorry. Sorry. - Go wash your hands. Go on. - See, see, see, Gustad? Very clean, very. See, see, very nice smell. Very, very nice smell, Gustad. - You're not ashamed of yourself? Stealing Roshan's doll. Doing such dirty things to it. - They would not. - [Gustad] Who's they? (chittering) - Nice, nice, nice. They said no, no, no. Gustad, they said no, no, no. They said no. - Why did you open the window? Your brother told you to keep everything shut. - It was very, very, hot, hot. Open window, very nice. - Now remember, no opening the window, even if you're feeling hot. Use the newspaper to fan yourself. Windows always stay shut at night. - Listen, listen, listen, listen. Gustad, listen, Gustad. Dolly. - Keep her. - Dolly is mine? (laughing) She's mine. Oh, Gustad. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. - Okay, okay, okay. - [Dilnavaz] The house seems so empty without you. Will you do something for me? - Hmm? - Daddy will be home in a little while. Just talk to him nicely. That's all. Just talk. - It's no use. I've spoiled all his dreams. He's not interested in me anymore. - Don't talk like that. He's your father. He loves you. - You know we'll start fighting as usual. - So much has happened since you left. Daddy's changed. It'll be different now. (subdued music) - [Gustad] Thank you for making the arrangements. - He was like a brother to me, too. Your Parsi don't allow outsiders like me to go inside. Thank you for coming. Otherwise, Billy Boy would have been alone. - [Gustad] What will you do now? - When someone kills my brother, I get very upset. I may collect my payment tomorrow, or next year, or after 10 years. Our life is as easy to snuff out as Billy Boy's. Like that. (people chanting in foreign language) - Please, Mr. Noble. They've burned down my house and now they're saying I have to give up this wall. For God's sake, do something, huh? - [Man On PA] Why we have stopped here? I say no better place than this sacred wall of miracles. Let us ask for blessing that when we reach municipality our problems will be heard. - Yes, Tehmul. Stay inside, stay inside. (speaking foreign language) (chanting in foreign language) - Yes, Tehmul. Stay inside, stay inside. - Stop, stop! No violence! (subdued music) (people shouting) - My god. Why is this happening? Stupid, stupid people. - Gustad. - Shh. - Thank you, Gustad. - We send for the ambulance. - No use now. (subdued music) - Maybe we should cancel the ambulance and phone the darn asylum instead. - [Doctor] Don't cancel the ambulance. Call six more. There are many wounded outside. - [Woman] But the body, it can't just lie here in front of the gate. - [Man] But why pick him up in the first place when ultimately he's going to come down anyway? - [Man] Let's move him into the shade. You take the feet, I'll take the head. Ready? One, two, up. (subdued music) (praying in foreign language) (sobbing) - [Gustad] Who is it? - Daddy, it's me Sohrab. - Yes, yes, yes. I'm really sorry about this. - Oh, don't be sorry. I'm very grateful to you. You and the wall have been very hospitable. Anyway, I was getting too comfortable. Time to leave. - But where will you go? - What does it matter where, huh? In a world where roadside latrines become temples and shrines. Then temples and shrines turn to ashes and dust. Does it matter where? Your cap. - Thank you. Good luck. - Luck is the spit of gods and goddesses. (uptempo jazz music) (subdued music)
