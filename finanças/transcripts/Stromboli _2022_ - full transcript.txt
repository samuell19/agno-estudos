Madam! Madam! - You cannot stay here. - Hm? It's dangerous. I'm waiting for the iceberg. Please, madam, you have to go and sit. I'm fine. Bye! Hi. Can I help you? A cappuccino and a grappa, please. Sure. So, I've heard the volcano has been very active recently. - Volcano? - Mhm. What volcano? Don't worry. It almost never... Erupts. Yes. Too bad. Too bad. And what brings you to Stromboli? Accusì... Ah! Oh! Sara, where are you? Why aren't you here? You can't just disappear like that. Pietro! Hi, it's me, Sara! Hi! From Caro e Sara. You know? Gustav. Gustav. Is it you? Ah, Pietro, you painted the house! I did. E che minchia si è portata via? What am I doing wrong, Sara? Say something, damn it! Una nave, una volta a settimana, viene da Napoli a rifornire tutta l'isola di acqua. Vorrei che fosse chiaro che qui l'acqua è poca. - Okay, thank you very much. - E che l'acqua... It's okay. Thank you. Buone vacanze. Bye! YOU RUINED EVERYTHING I'M SORRY SWEETHEART I'M SO SORRY SORRY SORRY FOR EVERYTHING REALLY Argh! God, Jesus Christ! Jesus... Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Sorry. So sorry. It's okay. Bloody rocks. Oh! Would you like to sit down? Well... Oh, could I...? Uh, just to rinse it off? - Yeah, I know what you mean, but it's not. - Huh? - No, it's not water. - Oh. It might hurt. - I have a very strong liver. - Oh, you do? Okay, well... - Please. - Thank you. Mm. Ah. Uh. I really have to get back. - No. - Mm. Yeah? Where is your apartment? Oh. Uh, I don't know. I've never seen it. I bought it on eBay, uh, two years ago? I'm a millionaire. Is it in the village, your apartment? No, it's somewhere in Spain. Oh, no. The group will be worried. You're with a group? What about one more drink? Come on. Do as the Romans do. Dinner is at eight. That's why you need an aperitivo. No, Jens will be angry. Is Jens your husband? Well, what about you? Is no one waiting for you? Yes. Gustav. - Won't Gustav be angry? - No. No, he'll understand. Oh! - Grazie. - Ooh. Here's the aloe vera. You have to rub it on your face, for sunburn. - Ugh. Yuck. - No, no. - My daughter was conceived on this island. - Oh. Oh. I'm more of a cat person myself. I love my cat. We have a dog. We had a dog. Is the dog dead? The marriage is. Oh. So, what's the name of your cat? - Susie. - Ah. - To Susie. - Ah. And to the volcano. - Ooh! - Speak of the devil. What will happen to Susie if the volcano erupts? What will happen to your daughter? I think she will be very relieved. Ah. - It's beautiful. - Do you like it? Yeah, it's too beautiful. Oh, shit! Did she see me? Nope! We're not supposed to drink. Oh, dinner's at eight! I'll... I'll be fine now. Uh, it's, um, it's just here. And thank you for a lovely evening. Um, have a nice holiday! Shit, where's my bag? Oh, fuck. Oh, no. Oh, no. Shit. Hi, did you found a bag? Cosa? Did you found a bag? And in it was a telephone, a towel, a... Guarda che carino! Oh, questo mi piace. Cosa? Should I buy this? Is it nice? Mom? Signora, mi dispiace ma non capisco. Carino, però a me piace il verde. Signora? Mi piace il verde. - Signora, tutto bene? - Yes. No? - Quanto ti devo? - Sono venti euro. - Ecco qui. - Hi. - Mr. Barista. - Hi. So happy to see you. Hi, can I help you? Yes. Could you please lend me some money? I lost my bag on the island. I don't know where it is. And now, I don't know where to go. Yeah, sorry. I don't think we've met before. Yes, we've met. We've met on the boat. Do you not... Oh! Ma vaffanculo, va! - Chi cacchio sei? - Calm down, man. Keep your hands off me, yeah? Get away, puttanazza. I'm paying tomorrow. No. You drink, you pay. But not today. Very expensive. Prada. Ah. Hey, Gustav. You're so sweet. Yes. Fuck. Ooh! Ah. Ah! Oh! No! Ma che cazzo ha combinato quella troia? Ah! Dove sei? Dove sei, puttana? Ma dove sei, puttana, dove sei? Ma hai visto che hai combinato? È bruciato qua! Ma che hai combinato? - Okay. - Tu mi devi pagare, devi pagare! Calm down. I will pagare, okay? Calm down. Just calma. Tu. Ma quale cazzo di coma? - Quale cazzo di coma? - Wait... - Puttana! - Hey. Ma levati, calma, cazzo di Eva! Devi pagare tutto, devi pagare. Tu non lascerai quest'isola se prima non hai pagato! I'm going to pay. I just need to find my bag, okay? Vai! Vai! Vai via! No, I don't have any money, but it's only for tonight, okay? It's only for tonight. La prego di accomodarsi e cercare posto altrove. - No, no, no, no, no! - Oh, ma te ne vai o no? Don't you touch me, I only want to use your toilet, okay? - Go away. - Don't you touch me. - Te ne devi andare... - Fuck you, Mr. Romantic Bed and Breakfast. - ...tu e questo asino puzzolente. Vattene. - Yeah. Jesus? Is it you? I'm Jens. I like your hair. Thank you. What's your name? Thank you. Sara. There's a hungry donkey outside. Oh no, Gustav. Is he okay? Yeah, I gave him some bread, too. Do you need help, Sara? No, I'm okay. I'm just really tired. Shall I take you home? I don't know where that is. I'm lost. A lost sheep. I think we have room left for Sara, don't we? I'll prepare the paperwork. - I... - You rest now. Dinner is at eight. YOU RUINED EVERYTHING I'M SORRY SWEETHEART I'M SO SORRY SORRY SORRY FOR EVERYTHING REALLY PLEASE CALL ME Om. Om. Hey, you! - Hey! - Hi! I thought you were staying with... Gustav? His owner kicked me out. Oh, I see. Have you entered the program? Oh, God. Is this coriander? Looks like parsley to me. But I told them I was allergic to coriander. Diane, Violet. This is... - Sara. - Sara! Yes. - Are you new? - Sort of. You see, it gives me heart palpitations, a little bit boring, but it does. Ah, rabbit food. Aren't we lucky bastards? - Dogs. - Hm? We always say dogs. But bastards works too. Right. Hans, this is Sara. - Sara, Hans. - Hi. - Welcome, everybody. - Oh. Did you sleep well? Oh, yes. Yes, I did. And thank you so much for my bag. It was brought back by one of the villagers. - Please, take some food. - Um. Everything is organic. I've made you a kelp salad, Diane. - It's right there. - Yeah. Thank you. So, any chance of a glass of organic wine maybe? We would appreciate if you would refrain from the use of alcohol during your stay. Jens will address the group in half an hour. Enjoy your meal. Non, je ne veux pas que tu viennes. C'est fini, tous les deux, tu as oublié? Va te faire foutre, Jean. Oui. Je te déteste aussi. Don't tell Jens. No. And don't tell Hans, either. He had some sort of coke-induced psychosis. Threw himself out the window. Brrp. Okay, will you keep an eye on me? Last time I did this I fucked my husband's best friend in the... What do you call it? The doghouse. We all have our own story. Some of you have had problems in the relationships. Some have lost loved ones. Some have had problems with drugs and alcohol. Now take a moment and thank yourself for coming here and giving yourself the opportunity to heal. And give yourself an applause! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Everyone, this is Sara. Hi, everyone. I'm Sara. Sara's from Holland and she'll be joining us for a while. - Oh, great. You're Dutch too? - Yes. I hope you all enjoyed our last evening meal prepared by the fabulous Thandi. Thank you, Thandi. Tomorrow, we'll start fasting. Oh, good. Guys! The next few days you will go on one of the most important journeys of your life. You will travel through fear, past shame, and anger. You might get lost. And there will be moments when you just want to give up. But trust me. If you put your work into it, you will reach your destination. Life without suffering. Without fear. Full of freedom. And love. Now, get some rest. Tomorrow, we'll start working! Yes! Okay! It's fantastic here. - This is my fifth time here. - Really? How wonderful. Goodnight, then. See you tomorrow. - Yeah. - Goodnight. Mm. Aha. So my son studied for half a year. That's right, yes. And you want me to pay the full tuition? Mhm. Well, do you know what that makes you, you fucking bitch, a thief. Uh. No, no, no, I won't take that back. You'll be hearing from me. Good morning. Do you know how much it costs to study at Cambridge? Uh, a lot? A fortune. I worked so hard, I... I had to take two jobs, I just worked like a dog. Um... Do you have children? A daughter. She turned 14 last week. Uh, how old is your son? He's dead. Um, is the air conditioning working in your room because mine... Mine seems to have been broken. Oh, my God. Your room is so much... So much nicer than mine, I'm going to complain to this Thandi woman. Yes! Can you feel the vibration? Just let it erupt! - Breathe! - Oh! Here we go! Yes! - Dance! - Ah! Come on, dance! Whoo! - Yeah! - Dance! Come on, now. - Yeah! - Oh! - Yeah! - Come on, join me. - I'm so sorry. I've got something in... - Yeah! - Come on! - Yeah! - Okay. - Come on, now. Yes! Yes! - Yeah! - Hey! Come on, up! Yeah! It's gonna be a tough week! Yeah! That's right. It seems like it. Yes! - You need that energy, right? - Yeah! - Whoo! - Yeah!

I mean, they starve you to death and then... Ooh, yes. They touch you with their little alien hands. Uh, not me, I told them beforehand, no touching. You don't like touching? I think it should be avoided at all costs. But what about when you're in a relationship? I think a relationship should be avoided at all costs. I agree. Complètement. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You've never been in a relationship? Well... Uh, no, not really. Um... I, um... I'd like to, but, um... Then I'd have to have sex and I don't like sex. Oh, my God, you don't like sex? All that fumbling and moaning. Oh, my God. - I love sex. - Yeah, we know, Sara. Excuse me? We saw you on the boat going behind the bar with that incredibly good-looking barista. Well, so what? I mean, why is it still not acceptable for women to enjoy sex just like men? I have no objections whatsoever. Me neither. I didn't see, but from what I've heard of that barista guy, I think even I would have made an exception for him. Oh, sweet little thing. Oh, my darling. Oh, uh. Come here, come on, my darling. Oh! Aw. I guess it doesn't like to be touched, huh? Does anybody know how many planets there are? Eight. I thought there were nine? No, no, no, there are eight. Venus. Mercurius. - Saturn. - Earth. Earth. That's four. Mars. Mars, five. Then there is, of course, Uranus. There's Jupiter and Neptune, so it's eight. And Pluto, nine. No, no, no. Pluto was thrown out. - Thrown out? - By who? The International Astronomic Union decided in 2006 that Pluto was no longer officially regarded as a planet. Poor Pluto, how very sad. Mm. One moment you're a family and the next... The next moment, you're all alone. Floating through space. Ah! - Ah! - Whoo! Yeah. Ah, sorry. This isn't going to work. Forget it. Hi, I'm having lots of fun at my party and... - Goddamn it! - Mom, no! - What are you doing? - Keep your hands off her! - What are you doing? - Get out! - Get out! - No! Why do you ruin everything? Get out. Fuck off! I WISH YOU WERE DEAD Sara. Sara. Sara? Good morning. I brought you some juice. For detox and energy. Jens is expecting you for a one-on-one. I'm really sorry, but I'm leaving. Okay. Thank you very much for your hospitality. I really appreciate it, but, um... - I can't do this. - That's absolutely fine. I'll make up your bill. Jens is waiting for you at the coffee bar down the street. Maybe you could have a cappuccino. Say goodbye. You cannot make me stay. Of course not. - Buongiorno. - Buongiorno, Tiziana, grazie. - Pago dopo alla cassa. - D'accordo, va bene. - Tra qualche minuto però. - Bene. Grazie. Don't worry. As long as it rumbles, it won't erupt. Mm. This is so much better than charcoal water. Oh, I thought coffee is poison. Busted. One day at a time, right? Yeah. Okay, shouldn't you ask me things then? About, I don't know, my lonely childhood or why I blew up my marriage? Why? Well, I thought we were having a one-on-one. Aren't we? Listen, you don't come across as someone who likes to share things. Besides, you want to leave, which is perfectly fine. Okay. Sara. I'm glad you joined us. At least for a while. Okay. Thank you. Okay, one last question. Why do you hate yourself so much? Half dead. Ugly. I feel sick. Confused. I feel, um... ashamed. So, you all feel sad. Ashamed. Because we lost the connection. So it's time to reconnect. I want you to pair up and lie on top of each other. Oh, dear God. Adela, why don't you pair up with Matteo? And Eva, please team up with Max. - Shall we pair? - Want to pair up? Just stand there, yes. Oh, you should stay away from him. You don't need another asshole in your life. Jesus, Sara. Laisse-moi. Mind your own fucking business. No, but, uh... I'm just warning you, okay? Yes, wonderful. Yes, you just... Yes. - Shall we share a mat together? - Um... No, I've already got... Focus. All yours. Relax. Sorry, Sara. Quite heavy. It's okay. Let go of the fear. Let go of the suffering. I'm not sure this is entirely hygienic. Please, try to play sincere. You're lying on top of another human being who's just as scared and vulnerable as you are. Okay. Okay. Let go of the tension. Breathe out. Just let it happen. Okay, this isn't going to work. What am I doing wrong? It's driving me crazy, do you understand? Say something, goddamn it! I'm sorry, Sara. No, everything's fine. - You okay? - Yes, it's fine. Fear causes wars. But also, depression, addiction, cancer, impotency, relationship problems, and burnouts. Oh, fuck this. Argh! - What's wrong? - I can't. - What's wrong? - I just can't, I, I, I... Don't touch me. Why is it so hard for you to be close to another man? - No, fuck. Don't touch me. - Come on! - Fuck off! - Yeah, fuck off. - No, no. - Now we're talking. I've had enough of this cheap bullshit nonsense, okay? - Okay, give it to me. - Fuck off, Jens! Yes, give me the anger, Hans! - You just leave me be, okay? - Come here. Show me. Yeah, come on! Give it to me! Yes! Abandon. Free yourself. Come on. Come on! Give it to me, come on! Yes! Come on. Let it all out! Come on! Come on, Sara! Go for it, come on! Yes! This is the root of your pain. Now go within. Allow it. Accept it. So, people. It's time to look back at the things you did. The things you didn't do. Did you lead the life you wanted? Do you have any regrets? I know this can be painful, but it's important. Life is not a rehearsal. I did something terrible. We all do terrible things, you know? You know nothing about me. I was the girl rich guys called when they wanted a few models at their party... Pretty girls. Who got paid a lot of money in exchange for partying. And sex. One of them was really young. And she didn't know. She didn't know the deal. We have a limited amount of time here on Earth. How do you want to spend it? Who do you want to spend it with? Who do you want to be? Does she talk to you, your daughter? Oh, um... She used to. She's angry with me now, so... Oh well, anger's fine. "Anger's good." Yeah. I was so proud of him, my son. He was so smart and handsome and off to Cambridge. He hung himself. I... I just missed all the signs. So, please. Really, let it sink in. When you're ready and you've found what you're looking for... slowly, swing back to the light. Come here, darling. Come on, come on, don't be afraid. I only want to help you. - Thank you. - Sleep well. There you go, sweetie. You were hungry, weren't you? Yeah, come on, come on. Don't be afraid. I won't touch you. Everything is fine. How did you find yesterday? Do you want some water? Yeah, okay. Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone. Sorry, guys. I'm so sorry, Jens, I had a little trouble turning back to the light. Why are you here? You all paid a lot of money for this week and made a long journey to get here. So tell me, why are you here? A friend of mine signed me up. You could be eating lobster on the French Riviera. Drinking yourself to death. Tell me honestly, why? Why did you divorce your husband? Me? He was a dick. Why did you marry a dick? Um, because I'm stupid. No, you're not. You're smart, funny, and kind. Why are you in a dysfunctional relationship with your parents and your daughter? - I never said that. - Why do you drink too much? - Sorry, I find this a bit... - And the most important question of all. Why did you let your entire life be determined by the fact that you were raped? Excuse me? I don't know what you're talking about. You don't feel there's a connection? A connection? A connection to what? To what's happening to you right now. To the loneliness you feel. Jesus, what a load of crap. Um... Well, I don't see the point in dragging up old shit from, I don't know, like 25 years ago! Have you talked to Hans about this? Maybe you guys can help each other. Help each other to heal. Wouldn't that be a relief? Was it your father? No. It was my gym teacher. If you don't act and do something, your lives will be ruined by this. You'll steal your own chance of happiness and fuck up the most important relationships in your lives. Including the ones with your children. When was your last confession, my child? I think the last time was in 1624. Have you ever told anyone? Just my dad. But he didn't really know how to deal with it. He said... "If you just don't think about it for long enough... it will be like it never happened." What about you? Did you ever tell anyone? Did I do something wrong? Mm? In bed. No. I just can't... I can't... I don't know how to do it. I've never had an orgasm. Oh. Everyone, this is a role play. Sara, you just watch. Diana plays your mother. Harold is your father. Hans is your ex-husband and Helene is you. Diana, whenever you're ready. Okay. Ready? Um... So... I tried so hard to reach out to you. But you just... You just close me down. You push me away. No, I don't think you wanted to hear what I had to say, so... But you don't know that that was true. Because I'm your mother... And I would have done anything, I would have done anything to save you. You know... You actually never gave me a chance. I actually don't think... it... it... it's very fair. You closed me down. You pushed me away. I don't think you wanted to hear what I had to say. What did you say? And what about you? As her father, didn't you notice a change in your daughter? I... I... I don't know why... - I'm sorry, guys, I just can't do this. - What is it, Harold? I don't know how this works, I... I don't know anything about families. Um... It was always just me and my mother, and... And she didn't like children. So, she always pretended that I was her husband. It's not about doing things right or wrong. Just follow your heart... and see where it leads you. Didn't you feel something had happened to your daughter? I... I... I think I did notice... something's wrong. But I... I didn't... I didn't want to acknowledge it. I was scared. I... I couldn't bear that someone had taken all the joy out of my little girl. You weren't scared. You were ashamed. You were deeply ashamed. Of what happened to your child. Even if this wasn't his fault. Her fault. You were just so caught up in your own shame, you couldn't be there for her. Karel. I need you to talk to Sara. What do you want to say to her? You should have told me, Sara. Maybe everything would have been different. Maybe we'd have had a chance. What the fuck? Oh God, I don't... Sorry, what's going on? I don't... Who's he? Don't ask me. Ask him. Who are you? - Oh, I'm the guy who raped your daughter. - No, you were not invited. Well, I'm here anyway. I don't think I want this, okay? - I don't think I want it. - Want to stop? What? No, I don't want him here. I don't want you here. Um... - I'm not going to do this, Jens, I'm, uh... - Do what? I'm just not even going to try and have a conversation with a rapist. It's fine with me. You don't interest me in the slightest. But I'd like to meet your daughter. Sofie. She's 14 now, right? Such a lovely age. - No, don't sit with him. - Jesus, Mom. No, sweetheart. Sit with me. Stop it. - But sweetheart... - I hate you! I'm only trying to protect you, okay? Why do you ruin everything? But sweetheart, I love you. I love you so much. It doesn't seem like it. It doesn't seem like it at all. Jesus, Sara... - Can I talk to Sofie? - Where are you? - I tried calling but she won't pick up. - What do you expect? Please. Sofie, Mom's on the phone. I don't want to talk to her. - Sofie. - I already told you. I'll speak to her. Sara. Please come back. One last step. That's all. I... I... I... I just don't understand. Why can't I be Sara anymore? Helene. I... I thought it went very, very well today. Absolutely. You've been a great help. For this reenactment, you play the rapist of Sara. I take the mic?

Sweetheart. Yeah, what is it? Sweetheart, I love you. I'm sorry about your party. It was the worst birthday ever. - But there's nothing you can do now. - I know.
