SURVIVAL Dad, my doll! Dad, my doll fell off. -My doll! -God, what's with the nagging? -My doll fell off. -Wait... Her doll fell off. You go get it, dear. -Careful, dear. -Careful! It seems like your mother's dead disturbed you a lot. I'll talk with the higher authorities. I think it's better you take some rest. Go on a trip for some days. -Hello! -Hello, Abhi? ♪♪ Breaking news! East Godavari district lady collector... ...got attacked by unidentified men at the outskirts of the city. Ramapuram people took her to the hospital, still in an unconscious state. We need to get more information on this incident. Dude, did you see this? The collector got attacked! Think about common men like us. Right! When a person is on the death bed... They remember their parents, or the person they love the most. But before I breathe my last... I am thinking of a village. I see the lives dependent on me. About the story of that village... My story will tell you that. My name is Subba Lakshmi and my village is... Ramulu, we have to pick up the harvest load. Get your vehicle. No way! Today is my daughter's results day. What results? You know, right? My daughter went to the city to give the collector exam. Oh, God! You are so high just for a single exam of your daughter. My son keeps writing the same exam again and again. -What exam is that? -Dad, let's go. Stop it! Let me talk. Some 'supplementary exam'. It would definitely be bigger than a collector exam. Uncle, supplementary exam means giving the exam you already failed in. -You fool! You are dead in my hands. -Dad, no! Look at them run. You did the right thing. Enough fun! You dad and daughter keep laughing all the time. -And here she comes. -She's been so tense all day. -Go talk to her once. -Right... Subbulu... Subbulu... Subbulu... Subbulu... Where are you, dear? Hello! Bujamma, your sister passed the collector exam. Is it? Dad! She passed the collector exam. Dear, why are you crying? Tears don't bring pain all the time. Sometimes they bring unbearable joy too. True. You worked so hard to get her educated. -She became a collector because of you. -Dad! I raised her on my heart! She dreamt for the sake of our people. And today it came true. My golden doll, Subbulu. Dad... Your uncle and aunt will be very happy for you, Subbulu. -There he is. -Brother-in-law... Hey, what brings your goddess here? Not just ours... She's a goddess for all our houses now. Your niece have become the collector. Is it? Good job! Listen, collector madam is here at our house. My dear! We have to give this good news to everyone. -Let's go. -Ok. -Uncle... Aunt... I'll take leave. -Ok, bye! Thank you! Namasthe, madam... This is your cabin and I'll be right here. Call me if you need anything. -[all]: Namasthe, madam. -Namasthe. She's the collector, sir. This is her first day at office. Won't you at least wish her? In my fourty years of service... The currency changed twice. And twenty collectors changed. But no collector worked in a way to earn my salute. With age, I gave up the hope of them doing any good to society. Let's see what she'll do. SUBBA LAKSHMI IAS Come on, do it. Hey, stop standing idle and work. Dad, mom sent you lunch. Keep it there. I'll come. -What, Ramulu? -Sir... Seems like you are getting your daughter well educated. She studies well. So I'm working hard at it. Bujjamma, what are you aiming for? I'll be a collector. Ooow! Huh! Even dreams should have limits. Your dad works in the fields. And you are talking about being the collector! What, Ramulu? Ok, be a collector. Be a collector. That project was already done, madam. Namasthe, collector madam. Doing good? My name is Ravi. People call me Thota Ravi. I'm the MLA's man. MLA brother loves me. And the people are scared of him. Of course, that's not the point. We have 20 acres of banana plantation in the outskirts of the village. It has a story behind it too. They cut down bananas in there. And if someone talks back to us... They also cut off heads. So what I'm saying is... You sign on that file. And I'll sign a cheque. If you sign on our file on the very first day... I'll make sure that you face no problems until you are here. If you say 'No' to all this... There might be deaths without reasons... But no death comes without pain, right collector madam? Think of it! Look MLA's dog, Ravi sir. You cook up nice silly stories. Tell them to watchmen who open gates for you. And to the brokers who salute without respect. They might listen to you. Not me. Collector, careful with your words. If the people who are scared of you fight back... It'll be your head that will be cut off in your plantations. The value of your sign will be a maximum of few zeros beside a one. But the value of my signature... Real lives! I didn't give you all this time to listen to your bloody stories. But to give clarity to a lot of people around here. You are a woman, collector. Learn some fear. Hey! Your ego is right under the feet of that woman. If I want to, one sign will do it. It will make people forget Thota Ravi once and for all. ♪♪ What happened? Oh, God! Are you hurt? Let me see. What's your name? Huh? Oh, no! Did you fall off your bike, Abhi? Are you hurt? Oh, God! I'm hurt, mom! Abhi! Abhi... Madam? Madam! Is everything ok? Are you feeling better now? I'm ok, doctor. [chatter] Sir, just a minute, sir. Women are being attacked from the last few months. How do you react to this, sir? Even a collector is not safe. Then how can your government promise safety to common women, sir? Look, the investigation is going on. We'll catch the culprits soon. No matter who's behind this, they'll get punished for sure. Sir, how's collector ma'am doing, sir? She's out of danger and is stable now. Sir, who's behind this? Tell us. -Sir, phone. -No more questions. -Are you her parents? -Yeah. She's safe now. We just shifted her to the room. -You can go see her. -Ok. You please be here, madam. You go see her, sir. Ok. I don't know how to tell you this. They say that God gave us women the strength to take any kind of pain. I'm telling this as a woman. Maybe you don't feel that kind of pain even in death. As she's strong, she's at least in the ICU now. Any other girl would be in the mortuary right now. Because of the attack, not just physically, but she got disturbed mentally too. Only her strong will to live kept her alive even in the last moments. No, please don't lose strength. -She'll be ok. -Oh, God! But I can tell one thing... This is not something that's done in the heat of the moment. It's a very pre-planned attack. Hey, did you see this? The collector got attacked brutally. Show me. He attacked the collector herself. Might be a big shot. Also, these women should stay at home. Do they need all this? Here are the papers you asked for, sir. Check these out. I'll go get the rest. What's this? Sitting in the dark, lost into deep thoughts! What's the status of the enquiry? It's been many days since the attack, right? The enquiry is going on. The case is not in just my hands, right? I forwarded the files to the higher officials. They are still on their table. Hey, what's will all this setup? I called you here because she's in serious condition. Why are you here and what are you doing? It seems like he'll mess it up! Dude, we have enough problems for now. You don't create new ones. It's been many days since the attack. The department didn't hire you to just update the status of the files. I don't want the files to move. I want this case to be solved. I'll make it happen. Back then, Abhimanyu got struck in the Padmavyuha. But now, this Abhimanyu drew up the Padmavyuha himself. No one can escape this. Let's go. Where to? Right from the place this story started... Let's search for its end. -Did you get any clue? -No. Let's go. I put in a word for the CCTV footage. It'll be arranged in two days. Where are you planning to start the investigation from? What's this? A Municipal Commissioner who's harassing his PA is caught by the collector. Inspector Ajay. Pooja, we don't have much time. I'll come straight to the point. Tell us what happened in the Municipal office that day. After my dad passed away, we faced many problems at home, sir. I bagged a job in the Municipal Office through a friend. My duty is to prepare a schedule for the Municipal Commissioner, sir. Like every other day, that day... -Pooja get that pen. -Ok, sir. Pooja! -Listen to me, just for once. -Sir, please let go of me. -Sir, it pains. Please leave me. -It's ok. I'll be fast. -Sir, please leave me. -Listen to me, no? Sir, let go of me. Pick up the pen. Madam, talk with respect. Pick up the bloody pen! I didn't make you remove your shirt to make you a hero. Removing your shirt in front of the men that you work with... Makes you angry. But the pain a woman goes through when a man touches her inappropriately, is much more. I can tell you the same after slapping you. But this will make you remember what you did. When a woman works in an office filled with men... It's not to be weak. But to be the strength for her family. Hey, pick up the work. Everything is stalled. It should be ready by this evening. Understood? Change that too. Did you hear me? Who are you, sir? Shall I pick up a baton and arrest you? You'll get clarity. Nice! You are getting your daughter married this evening. But you are fooling around with a girl of your daughter's age. Do you remember Pooja? A nice police treatment will make him remember everything. Sir, she's a really nice girl, sir. I'm the one who did the mistake. But I did it in the heat of the moment, sir. She got hurt, but... Even I lost my name and credibility in society, sir. Things are getting back to normal. Please don't do this now, sir. How can we trust you? Sir, the one who wants to escape lies. Not the one who got caught. The amount of clarity you have on your story... I have the same amount of doubt on you. If I get clarity that it's not just a doubt... You'll be the one I'll arrest first. -Ok, sir. -Let's go. His answers are stronger than our questions. So, I think he's not a suspect. How else could it be? Sir, tea. Uncle, two tea. Uncle... Three months ago contrator Divakar fought with the collector. Do you know anything about that? Yeah, I know Divakar. The other day... What brings you here? Sir, please hand us our house papers. We'll move here, at once. Yes, sir. We want to move in. Without boring you, I'll come directly to the point. Listen. How much do you want? And when do you want it? And when will you sign the papers? Sir, owning a house is our dream. We can't sell our dreams. And we won't sign the papers. I need signatures. Not silly answers. This is wrong, stealing our houses. Where should we sleep? -In your bed? -What the hell! If you come give me, I'll take only your houses. If I come to get it, I'll take your lives too. Madam, you have to help us out. Contractor Diwakar has our house documents with him. Where do we stay now? [song playing on stereo] Hey, what's happening? Who are you people? What's happening? What's with all this? No! What's with the bad smell! Police! Do you think taking over contractor Diwakar's house is right? Why don't you answer? When Diwakar took over our houses, no one listened to our pain. But we are here just for few hours... And it has become a breaking news for you guys. Of course, even if a dog from a rich house goes missing... It's breaking news for you guys, right? -Don't forget that you are talking to the media. -What are you even talking about? [commotion] Stop! He took away public's properties and the government hits him now. If this gets repeated, the public will hit him. Murthy sir. -Uncle. -Madam! These properties are yours from now on. Namasthe! See, we got our houses. We got our houses! [people hailing collector] Something seems odd, Abhi. They say your bought 50 acres in front of the Uppada beach, Diwakar. Nicely done! They also say you can buy the entire Kakinada city in a single payment. Sir, these are my ancestral property, sir. So, Abhi... His ancestors laid foundations for his wrongdoings. You warned the collector, right? Warn me too. I did? Sir, it just happened that day. You know about the people, right sir? They sell off more than half of the lands the government gives them. That's what I buy from them? I said I can't give the rate I asked for. The deal was off and they complained to the collector, sir. Who said that our movies lack stories. Look at him go! I'm not lying, sir. Enquire if you want to. You have a clarity in your story. I too need the same clarity, right? -Once I do, let's meet again. -Ok, sir. A culprit says 'Sorry'. But he's answering our questions. I feel like we can rule him out. If it's not both, who else it could be? Hey, did we get the footage from the collector office? Forgot to tell you. The CCTV footage went missing because of a server issue. What? How can it just go missing? Let's go to the collector office at once. Ok. -What's your name? -Ramya, sir. Are you the collector office server room in charge? Yes, sir. It's me. In a government office, that too in a collector's chambers... You simply say that the footage got missing from a server problem! -Sir, that's... -No. I don't need any explanations. I just need that footage. In two days, I want the retracted footage on my table. Ok, sir. Sir, please let us meet collector ma'am once. -Please, sir! -Hey, old man... Stop nagging me. She's still in the hospital. -Go sit there. -What's this! Grandpa... What happened? Why do you want to meet the collector? Just a minute. I'll call you back. Grandpa... RAMAPURAM Ramapuram! The dates in the calendar changes, but not our lives, Raju. What, Swamy? Did you go to the collector office again? You have to get vexed of going there, but... They won't even look at us. Also, you are about to die soon. Do you need all this now? We used to have 400 houses in our village a few years ago. And the graves are less than 50. But now? We have less than 200 houses. But the graves are much more than that. That's why at least before I go into the grave... I want to reduce that count. And at least give you guys a better life. But for all that to happen... A goddess or a god should walk our lands. Namasthe, madam. Collector madam, what brings you here? Hey, old man! What did you tell her? Madam, don't believe in his words. We are very happy here. There's nothing wrong here. We are doing really well. See, he didn't tell me anything. Looking at your anxiety, I can understand what's what. No matter how huge the problem is. Or how big the man who's creating the problem... Tell me. Who's he? No! We have no problems here. -We are doing good. -Stop it! If we don't use our voice now... It will die along with us soon. Madam, they are trying to bury our problems along with the seeds. I'm a BSC agricultural student, madam. I left a job that pays in lakhs... And I'm working with agriculture as my goal, madam. The farmer, the land, or the water... None of these are the problems here. It's the man-made fake seeds, madam. -Fake seeds? -Yes, madam. We have been buying seeds, selling off our mothers' gold for years. The farmer who's supposed to get the harvest... He's hanging himself to death, madam. Along with the harvest, we are losing our elders too, madam. We are losing our elders too! Madam, don't believe his words. Nothing happened here. We are really happy. Sister! My dad went to the field and didn't come back yet. My mom says that he'll come home tomorrow. At least you tell my dad to come home, sister. It's been so long since her father died, madam. How to give this poor girl that news... We have no idea, madam! -Murthy, sir. -Madam... The factories belong to MLA Peddi Reddy. Murthy sir! Madam, that MLA won't let us live. Please don't do this. Please don't sign those papers. East Godavari collector gave a shocker to MLA Peddi Reddy. Stating that he's producing fake seeds in his factories... Collector Subba Lakshmi seized the factories. We have to wait and see how MLA Peddi Reddy is going to react to this move. Madam, we have many other problems too. That MLA and his son... What, collector? I have heard a lot about you. Tell me if your blood is that hot. There are other ways to cool it down. Not just your convoys, even our heavy vehicles travel the same roads. Do you want a breaking news of your unfortunate road accident? With one sign of yours, they've celebrated like hell! Maybe a maximum of ten heads will bow to you. The right amount will make the same heads bow to us too. No one tastes the salt before buying it. The same goes with our seeds. You are acting too smart for these low-life farmers. They are just daily labourers! Don't spoil your life for their sake. The GO you just passed with a signature... Cancel it with the same signature. Why are you smiling, collector? -Sign the papers! -Brother, look at this. I'll see your end, collector. Yours too! She took away my respect. She made a fool out of me, in front of everyone. I'm not going to leave her. No! Brother, cool down. Have this peg. I never felt bad even when my dad hit me. All-day, I keep remembering what she did. Even when I'm in bed with my wife... I keep remembering her bloody smile! I won't let her go, without killing her brutally. Brother, it's not the collector you should kill... -Tell me, dad. -Bujjamma... -What are you doing, dear? -Working, dad. Subbulu, today is a festival day in our village, right? -Today? -You have to be here, dear. -Come here, fast. -Ok, I'm starting. -Ok, dear. -Ok. Collector, madam. He's gone. My son is gone. I kept telling him not to... But he still followed you and see what happened to him now! Whom should I live for now? What should I live for, madam? My strong standing son is now just dust! With the hands I should be blessing him... I'm carrying his remains. Please, never step into our village again. No need to better our lives. Listen to me, uncle... No! Don't tell me anything. I want an answer to my son's death. [all]: We want an answer. [all]: We want an answer. [all]: We want an answer. [all]: You have to answer us. -Everything is going great, right? -Yeah. Sir... Sir! -Our Subba Lakshmi is here. -Hey, Subbulu is here. Subba Lakshmi is here! Sir, the girl from our village... She came back as a collector. Let's make her light the holy light this year. As if there is a difference between me lighting it and my niece lighting it. -Get it done. -Ok, sir. -Dad! -My, dear. Madam, you have to light the holy light this year. -Me? -Yes, madam. It's ok. Do it. Take it. I want an answer to my son's death. I want an answer. My strong standing son is now just dust! Ranga, calm down. He won't come back, right? Be strong. Calm down. Please calm down. Why did you come back? Do you want to cause more damage and kill more people? We don't have the strength to take any more pain. Go away. Please leave! Please hear me out. -Please... -Get lost! You rich live on the graves of the poor. How can we even trust you? Ranga, calm down. Listen her out once. She didn't plan on doing all this, right? Forgive me, uncle. A simple 'Sorry' won't cover your loss. I'm a government servant. Questioning a wrong doing is my right. True. All this happened because of me. So I'll correct it myself. It's not just your son that you've lost, uncle. My brother too. I can't bring back your son. But... I'll answer every tear you've shed. Trust me for one last time, uncle. Even if I lose my job. Even if I have to face death. I'll stand for you. Trust me. God! A puncture and at this hour. -Driver, what happened? -We don't even have a stepney. Damn it. -What happened? -A tyre got punctured, madam. -Tyre puncture? -Yes, madam. I'll go check if there is a puncture shop nearby, madam. Where will we find one at this hour! Murthy sir. Murthy sir. Murthy sir. Murthy sir! -Murthy sir... -Madam! Murthy sir. Murthy sir. Murthy sir! Subbu... Subbu... Diwakar and Commissioner are off the list, Abhi. This is definitely the MLAs doing. The first two are angry with Subbu. But the MLA has a vengeance. Because she closed his seeds factory and disrespected him in the media. She made a fool out of his son. Why will they even leave her alone? This is definitely the MLA's doing, Ravi. -What's his name? -Peddi Reddy. Keep it there. Namasthe, collector. How's your health? Is everything ok? People think that it's me who ordered the attack on you. I came to know that. 30 years ago, everybody thought I can do nothing. And now? No matter what happens... They think it's my doing. That's why I'm here to clarify. I only hit people soft and silent. I'm not this direct. There's no need of coming all the way to say this. You are a woman, right? I just wanted to meet you in person out of respect. The fake seeds you are talking about... The loss you have caused me is nothing. Understand? We have a habit in our village... No one from our place will ever hurt a woman. We don't play politics. No need for it! Take care of your health. Listen... I see love towards her in your eyes. I hope you see the truth in my words with the same eyes. Bye! Take care of her. I don't know if I should tell you this now... From a contractor to the commissioner... I enquired everyone who I though can be a treat to you. I couldn't find even a single clue. I can't find the point of mistake, Subbu. Maybe this attack is not planned. We might be wrong. Anyhow, you need to rest, Subbu. First, recover. Then we can talk. Abhi, who am I? I'm an IAS officer. Maybe I'm not in a state to save myself that day... But I'm not foolish enough to not understand that the attack is planned. I'm a collector. There's a whole system behind me, Abhi. How can you so easily say that I might be wrong? Then why do I need all these people around me? A department that can't save the collector. Can it save a common girl? You tell me. -I need an answer, Abhi. -But, Subbu... -Hello! -Sir, this is Ramya. -Ramya, tell me. -Sir... I found the CCTV footage, sir. -Where are you, Ramya? -Sir... I'm coming to meet you, sir. Auto... Sir! Ramya! Ramya! Ramya, where are you at? Ramya, can you hear me? Who the hell are you? Stop screaming. Hey, you only know how to draw Padhmavyuha. But I also know how to get out of it. Subbu! I'm coming for you. Ramya died, Abhi. Damn it! Abhi! Why are you disconnecting a call from the higher officials? Have you gone mad? Don't risk your career. Answer the call. I know your past was painful. But you have to accept it. Past is good only in memories. To move forward in life, you have to forget the past. Do I need to come this far to just forget it? I'm here only because I'm carrying the weight of my memories every day. [commotion] Ajay, where are you? They are thrashing us. You guys come fast. [commotion continues] Hey! Stop it! Dude, we have to hit the outsider together. But not fight with each other, right? Who started this? Rupa, dude. Fighting for a girl had started from Ramayana and Mahabaratha itself. -It didn't stop yet? -No, dude. Sai is making Rupa not come meet me. Is it? What did I do? She gave me a flower and a smile. She gave you a flower just here. She called me home and gave me... flower. Hey, it takes a lot of time to teach you about girls. Dude, we have ten minutes for the class to start. Go rock until then. ♪♪ You guys go to the class. Hey, girl... Did you say that you were born for me 16 years ago? So I have to take care of you for 84 more years. Is the count right, dude? I'll make it right! You, idiot! You teach us all this stuff, right? Won't you follow any? Will you die if you don't give her a flower or what? You can still handle a slip of leg. My heart slipped seeing her. It's not balancing, dude. -He'll do that for sure. -What's with the murmur? What's your name? Abhimanyu, sir. Friends call me Abhi. Your name won't give you the strength for wars! Just like naming you Gandhi won't bring a country its freedom. What's your name? -Colour, sir. -Colour? -Such a strange name! -My dad is a painter, sir. As his work is his everything, he named me so, sir. God! You are killing me. What's your name, sir? Hey! Balu, sir. People call me 'Thin Balu' sir. Apt name! Wow! Look at yourselves. You, your names, and your attires. Looks like an army of monkeys. Hey, the cycles should be in the stand... -And the snacks should be in the canteen. -Ok, sir. You should be in your classrooms. If any of this ever changes... You'll have TCs in your hands. Get out! What's the late? -Hey! Hey! -Oh, God! It's the principal. Hey, the girls are coming. -Hello! Excuse me. -Tell me. He'll say 'Sorry' for sure. Good morning, students. Today we'll discuss about adjective... An adjective is one of the nice parts of speech. An adjective is a word that tells more about a noun. It describes and modifies a noun... You, idiot! Get out from the class. Subbu... Your dad met with an accident... Your uncle is waiting in the office room. Come fast. -Sir! -Ok ok, please go. Abhi, let me go. Where are you taking me? You said my dad met with an accident, right? Don't worry, Subbu. Your dad is fine. I just wanted to see you. Maybe you have the habit of playing with people's emotions are feelings. You don't care about their suffering, right? Damn you! Everyone will have a world along with a dad... But my dad is my whole world. If you repeat something like this again... Subbu! [classroom chatter] Subbu... Switch places with me. Damn! Subbu... please hear me out. Subbu, stop! Stop! And listen to me. Talk to me for just two minutes. -Leave me, Abhi. I can't talk to you. -Why? Why don't you understand me, Subbu? Or tell me what to do what not to. This... Don't do this. Would you really hurt someone you love? Subbu... Subbu, it's ok. I'll change. Completely... I'll listen to you. Marry me, Subbu! Have you gone mad? Is this the age? Let's elope. Let's elope and get married, Subbu. Dad! -I won, dad! -You have to win, Bujjamma. Your win is your dad's win. How can that be, dad? I might have lost the game... Or I can play until I win... But life won't work that way. Bujjamma. You are the one who has to trust it and walk with it. Dad will be in your life... Not all your life, Bujjamma. Because every father who takes care of a daughter... He will trust his daughter more and more every day. Some times our eyes will deceive us. But as I'm a dad... I'll only believe in the truth. Also, I know that my daughter know what do to and when to do it. I trust you that much, Bujjamma. -Happy birthday, dude. -Hey! Happy birthday! -Hey! Happy birthday! -Happy birthday, dude. Dude... -Abhi! -What's with you? We all are enjoying and what's with you? Hey, this is not our Abhi. The Abhi I know... My friend Abhi won't be like this on my birthday! You talk as if you did a Ph.D. on girls, right? Going mad just for a girl... Don't you feel any shame? If someone asks you the depth of an ocean... No one will jump in and start counting. Same with my love for Subbu. With all you guys around me... I'm still not with me. What he said is right. That Abhi is different. I want Subbu, Ajay! -Sorry, dude. -[all]: Sorry! Happy birthday, dude. [chatter] -Got to know anything about Subbu? -No! -But she gave you this letter. -Letter? -So you gave him a letter. -When is our turn! Bye, dude! Abhi, I don't know how much you love me, but... The love you think of is making me suffer. You don't care for others feelings and emotions. You would do anything to make what you want to happen. Do you know something? My every happiness comes from through my dad. But you made me lower my head in front of my dad. Even now, I'm not angry with you, Abhi. I just wanted to see you in a great position. I'll take leave, Abhi. Take care. Bye! Memories that remind you of the past... And in the search for the truth... I need an answer for the war that's happening inside me, Ajay. Cool down, Abhi. You are trying your best, right? Abhi... Look at the red cap fellow being common in all the paper cuts. Seems like some kids are playing cricket around here. Hey! Ajay, let's go. -You go that way. -Ok. Hey, stop! -Hello! -I got him. Meet me at the station. On my way. Oh, God! Oh, damn! Where's he? There he is. Hey, look up! Come on! Sir! Tell me, Veeri Babu. Shooting? Will they pay well? I'm in my right form these days. We are trending now. Hey... Who the hell is he? Wow! Nice cap. -Hey, stop! -Who the hell are you? Sir! Hey, he's not the one. What? He's the one who ran with a red cap on. He mislead us. Damn it! -We missed him at the last moment. -Sir! Sir! Dude, let him go. Oh, God! Such a thrashing! Sir, where's my husband, sir? Your husband! Is that him? God, yes! Why did you thrash him, sir? It's not like what you think, sir. He's a really good man, sir. -True story, sir. -Please let him go, sir. Sir, she's right. He's not a thief or a killer, sir. He's the Tik-Tok star Durga Rao, sir. Very famous. Check out this video, sir. Oh! So you say he's famous on Tik-Tok! Why to see his video? Let's see his live performance. Durga Rao, we are frustrated with not finding a lead in this case. Do entertain and help us relax a bit. [both]: Of course, sir. We will. [song playing on stereo] -We need more energy. -[both]: Ok, sir. Dude, it's still mild. Increase the dose! We need the punch. Sir, forget other songs. He's famous for one particular song. Hit that. -Is it? -Please stop! I danced to the songs you have asked for. But this song is my brand. I need a special setup for that. -302. -Yes, sir. I don't understand if I'm solving the problem or creating one. I'm getting tired. Not even a single clue! Damn it! You'll find stories without meaning. But not without an end, Abhi. Sometimes our anxiety kills our minds. Think with a cool mind and you'll get to him. Shall I tell you something, Abhi? You might be tired from searching for him. But I'm never tired of our friendship. My Abhi will never lose. A few years back, when you said you love a girl, I saw your courage. Now I see you pain. And in the future, I have to see happiness in your eyes, Abhi. Goodnight, dude. Bye! Ajay, get up! Dude! Ajay, get up! Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! Dude, get up! -How is he, doctor. -Nothing serious. Small fractures. -We'll shift him to the ward in the morning. -Thanks, sir. Sir... Tell me. We got the one who did the accident, sir. Real estate Ram Krishna. He's really drunk while he did it, sir. -Arrest him. -Ok, sir. Have it. You don't talk, yet make us cry. Look where you are, Subbu! I feel so helpless. Forgive me. How can you say that? That's just her fate. And this is our Karma. No one can help it. That's all. As a little girl, when you said you wanted to be a collector... I told you that it's too much for people like us. Do you know what she said? Dad, how could you compare education and economic standard! I felt really proud that day. Seeing her work hard day and night... I asked her if she need all that pain? She said it's not just for her, but for all the girls like her. But none of that had saved her, right? These jobs, studies, social services... They are like flying kites. No one can say when they'll drop dead to the ground. It's ok. I at least got my daughter back alive. Right! She's alive... And she's safe. She will be. If she can't walk... I'll carry her on my shoulders. But if I had to carry her to the graveyard on the same shoulders... My heart will stop! It will! Come on, control yourself. Don't feel bad. Let's go. You hid your love back then. Now you hide your tears! We can't hide love or pain, Subbu. Do you know how valuable they are? Abhi... Can I ask you something? When you are in pain... Or happy... Did you ever remember you? Aren't you angry on me? In happiness, we remember the people we love. In pain, we remember the people who love us. My Subbu can't hide anger or love. Subbu, do you know your strengths? Your smile... and your courage. The Subba Lakshmi I saw is different. I want to see the angry Subba Lakshmi I once saw. Subbu, do you remember? They used to say that Subba Lakshmi's anger is like a dangerous curse. Subbu, let's go. Abhi! Trust me! No matter how much we struggle, the Mother saves us, right? Collector madam is here! Madam, take the holy blessings. You too, son. We are happy that you are out of danger. This is the magic of our Mother Olluramma! Pray for her. The Mother will always protect you. -Is everything ok now? -Yeah. All good, uncle? -Uncle, who's this girl? -She's... She's our village master's daughter. On the night of the attack on you... Her family... Died in an accident. We are taking care of her from then on. He's driving me crazy! Sir, on the night of the attack... He's the one who took us to a parked car in the woods. Listen... Do you remember what did you see that day? Sir, he saw something else that day. He's been scribbling something from that day on. Hello! Tell me, Ajay. How are you now? Abhi, he's killing me! Abhi, save me! Abhi, he's killing me! Hello, Ajay! Hello! Who the hell are you? Please let him go. Please! He's my friend. Is it? I feel so sorry for him. But where's the kick in a straight story? Please let go of him... Ajay! Let him go? Let him? Ok! Hello, Ajay! There's is a lot more coming, my son! Ajay! [singing] Shall I tell you something, Abhi? You might be tired from searching for him. But I'm never tired of our friendship. My Abhi will never lose. Ajay, you have been my strength. Now you are my courage. I swear on your soul... That I'll catch him! Hey! Are you blind or what! You? I'm late for my construction work, sir. Sorry, sir. Construction? We got the one who did the accident, sir. Real estate Ram Krishna. He's really drunk while he did it, sir. You are Real estate Rama Krishna, right? The drunk and hit case. I swear! I have nothing to do with that accident, sir. I'm going home drunk and someone hit me from behind on my head, sir. I woke up in the police station. They just took that car to the police station, sir. Excuse me... You got an order three days ago. Can you give me the details? Sorry, sir. My manager is not in. If you still want that information... You have to pay me with something. The order came from the Ratna Palace lodge, sir. Excuse me... The food order of this bill is booked from this hotel. Can you give me the room number? This is the only lodge around here. A lot of people come and go every day. How can we say who ordered from what room? Can I go check the room? A little urgent, please! -Ok, make it fast. -Thanks, sir. -Who are you? -Sorry! What do you want? Who are you? Hey, why are you peeking in? Hi... Where's the other receptionist? Satti Babu? He just went off duty, sir. I just came in. -What do you want, sir? -Nothing. From which room was this ordered? This? It's our room boy Malli's order, sir. He's been eating the same kind of food from the last ten days! -Ok, thank you. -Welcome, sir. -Sir, I'm off duty. -Ok, go. -Sir... -What? I forgot the parcel. Brother, here is the food parcel. [singing] Brother, tea. So you are finally here! Vishwa! He... How can he attack me? Subbu! It's me... Your Vishwa. The one who worked for you and your uncle's house, with loyalty. The one who went mad for your beauty. The desire to have you rose to new levels every passing day. But you started taking new, unattainable heights. Subbu... With you being the collector... What would happen to me? I thought of killing myself. Didn't happen. I thought of killing you. I'll kill you! But I couldn't do it. Subbu, right then they said... Forget killing her and think of how to destroy her. They said only then you'll be mine. -Leave me. -Subbu... If I want to kill you... I would have. Subbu! I agreed to this, not to kill you. But to enjoy your downfall. Do you want to know who ordered me to kill you? -Tell me... -I won't! Subbu... Don't get tensed and waste your emotion. I kept searching for your enemy all these days. They are right next to you... In the form of family. Wonder who! Abhi... why are you looking at my parents? It's me! SIVA SAKTHI TRAVELS It's me! With your growth... you left us in tears. Do you think we are worthy enough only to open your car door for you? You used to stand at my door for just some sugar. But now I have to wait for your appointment, is it? My daughter died just because of you and your merit. What is this? You are the one who talks people out of fear and pain, right? Be strong! She won't come back, right? Did you listen? Subba Lakshmi got the first class. And Prasad Rao's daughter failed. That's why she committed suicide. Yeah, everyone thinks the same. Not just ours... She's a goddess for all our houses now. Your niece have become the collector. I gave your dad seeds for his crop. But you closed off my seeds business. Did you send the monthly seed load? -Sir, that's... -Take care of the accounts. Your niece has sent orders to close our seed factories, sir. People feel weird about your own niece doing this to you, sir. Damn it! You are our relatives... So what! How you guys used to be! You used to keep your heads bowed in front of us. But now... Does the public bowing their heads to you made you big? Does it! Sir, our Subba Lakshmi is here. -She's here. -Subba Lakshmi is here. Sir, the girl from our village... She came back as a collector. Let's make her light the holy light this year. As if there is a difference between me lighting it and my niece lighting it. -Get it done. -Ok, sir. No matter how much you earn and rise... You have to know your place. Your heads should stay bowed. Your mom used to wear my old sarees as new. But now everyone respects her above me. How do you think that will let me be at peace? That's why we wanted to take away YOUR peace. We can't do that directly, right? That's why we used him as a pawn. We wanted to destroy you! Sir, it's not what it looks like... Sir! Did you like what you see? Want to get her? Go get her! Go get her... Come on... What's all this, aunty? I treated you equally to my mom and dad. But... You failed to treat me like your daughter. I thought everyone is happy about my win. But... I get it now. Everyone is happy... except you. Except you! You are angry only because I've been the collector, right? What if it's your neighbours Lakshmi or Sita? You would have been happy for them, right? People say that our win will make our own people jealous... And I didn't believe in it. But now I see it! After all this... Do you know why I still call you 'Aunt'? After Maheswari died... The way I look after my mom and dad... I promised myself that I would look after you the same way. You guys grew angry with me... But my love that grew towards you... You failed to see it! Subbu... We are getting late for the press meet. Collector Subba Lakshmi recovered from the attack. And she's going to go live from her office. The public is waiting eagerly for her speech. Madam, did you get to know who's your attacker? Is it the MLA like everyone thinks? They say that some big-shots who hate you did this. What's your opinion? Please answer, madam. If not you, who will answer the public. Please talk. Sometimes in life, we come across a time we can't accept. Right then, the world around us with show the reality. We can't justify everything. We can't expect everything and every turn... But they'll show us a truth that we never saw. The same thing happened with my life. What happened, madam? Is this an attack, or a plan to kill you? This is not an attack. For a question I never imagined... The world I believed in is the answer. This is a weapon that's used against me. But... What they don't know is that... None of this managed to break my self-confidence. They made me even stronger. I never thought... That the family I've got around me... Will drag me down. Madam, what are you trying to say? Let me tell you a small story. I still remember... That day, a six-year-old girl... Witnessed what helping others look like. The girl asked her father who she is and he replied 'It's the collector'. He didn't understand what inspired her, but he took up his daughter's dreams. But his daughter's win will make only him a happy person. But is own people will feel jealous of her. And he failed to see that. My success made my own people jealous. It came until it almost killed me. This has to change and that's the truth. We have to change it. Breaking news! The mystery is finally solved. Police arrested MLA and his son along with collector's uncle and aunt. The powerful lady, Subba Lakshmi IAS too charge as collector again. ♪♪
