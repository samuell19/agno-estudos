Up to this point Hamse has no decisive clue. He knows however that he has died many a time The first occasion he is totally sure of happened when he was brought out of the womb with brutal violence The crime scene? A small maternity ward in the city of Elsinore North of the Zealand Island in the kingdom of Denmark ♫ ♫ [Engine noise] Strategically located, Elsinore emerged as a wealthy medieval port in which the king himself collected tolls from all ships wishing to enter or leave the Baltic Sea. ♫ ♫ ♫ Thanks to William Shakespeare however the city is not particularly known for its history but rather by a unique work of fiction. ♫ ♫ ♫ There is no evidence that the playwright had ever set foot in Elsinore not that the author himself had walked the innumerable and intriguing secret paths of its kronborg castle ♫ ♫ ♫ What people have known for centuries however is that Shakespeare immortalized Kronborg by making it the location for the tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. ♫ ♫ ♫ [Music continues] Raised in this literary atmosphere it is not a surprise that detective Hamse Leth his name being an obvious homage to the hero, crafted his investigative mind with the quandary that tormented the young Danish Prince. The total devotion to separate the being from the seeming. [Footsteps] [Man approaching the door] [knocks the door] [door opens] [door closes] Hamsee... I know that probably is not a very good time, but we need to talk. No, Niels, this is definitely not a good time. especially if you want to talk work Another day Maybe to talk about work? what work? if you wait another day there won't be any work to talk about Financing is your job, we decided long time ago that they were supposed to make sure that the company's account was healthy But when we did great you immediately upgraded your lifestyle and bought a fancy house in some bourgeois area up north and a brand new BMW I'm not stupid Niels, the bankers are not after our company but they want your neck But what financing miracle can be done when you haven't sold a single case in a whole year? Look... I know times have been bad but our company has existed for 12 years and it will survive until small It won't Calm down, Niels... Maybe I haven’t dedicated myself enough but I've been through a rough time this past.... -month You know, in these past 12 months.. and your present crisis has a name hasn’t it? It always like that We could call it Anna Jansen or is she already Anna Sorensen by now? - cut the crap Don't talk about stuff you haven't got a fucking clue about. Or I shouldn't I say anything because I know too much about it. Neils, drop it! This is not going to happen, at least not tonight Anyway, I've had enough of this conversation Now, you go Leave, please! [Puffs] Okay! I go... but I want you to know That I won't under any circumstance lose my money because of you It could have been a great team, you know Discipline and method on one side, intuition on the other but you always preferred to work against me Yeah! and why shouldn't I? you're quite an attractive target with those fancies of yours.

It was your mother's house I care about her and we are good friends but of course it's just a detail for you If you had to choose you would be inside your mom’s womb, wouldn’t you? I had too much to drink, that’s true But I had good reasons… Oh, come on, Hamse Give me back my dignity and then I'll certainly leave you in peace for good Maybe I'll just disappear, disintegrate… or kill myself Then you all would be free from the devilish influence I exert in this society you care so much That was before the ceremony Now, you need to repair your terrible deeds, Not to me because I don't give a damn about you But to the people I care about Those who will continue to be a part of my life Okay, it's settled! I'll go back and talk to your parents right away And by the way I would also like to talk to your fiancée -husband Whatever I would tell them how bad and evil I am will be nothing new to them and can actually be a bit boring [cars noise] They don't give a shit what Hamse has to say Let's face it Anna, this is all about your pride This whole scene is about you isn't it? My humiliation will do you so much good You are a fucking lunatic, you know that? and worse, you're drunk!

He's a pathetic and worthless being, a fraud Your son is a fraud This obsession about investigating people What the fuck is that anyway? He's a failed detective He waits for the world to adjust to his clues, not the other way around He loved you, my dear He doesn't love anyone, Margretha, he analyzes them, and as soon as his curiosity is satisfied He walks away He didn't walk away from you Can you please both stop talking about me like I'm not in the room? Do society a favor, Hamse! Investigate yourself! What do you say? Are you ready for that? Tell her, mother; tell her what you told me! Quiet, Hamse, don't make things worse He's an imbecile!

You can stay calm and at ease My Hamse is kind with women, you see A true gentleman in almost all aspects But I have the impression I already know you from somewhere Your parents happen to be from Elsinore? At least... you're not a foreigner!? No, they are from Copenhagen, and so am I. But I can guarantee you that your son, he will receive exactly what he deserves No more, no less, It's the law of the market Oh, I see... The market’s law I'm not acquainted with that... but I am very grateful though... Son, Hamse! Mother, please don't call me like that!

What do we do now? Should I start, or you know the procedures? As you wish [opens the bottle] Let's follow your script, then Don't you have a routine? [bottles colloiding] [silence] I don't have a sex routine if that's what you want I know what that is… It's a pentagram Yeah, it shows us the five edges, it's the union of different ones You really know about this It's also a very old symbol, always associated with mystery and magic Exactly! The witches use this as a recognition of their fate and to be recognized By who? Among themselves I see… It's like the seal of Salomon Are you into religious stuff? Well, I'm Jewish Well, my mother is Jewish That makes me Jew, right? Yes, perhaps, but tell me, what has made me a witch? [giggles] You're a witch, a “whore witch”? Sorry, I'm sorry, that was stupid You're a jerk, you know that? Please, tell me more about this pentagram [silence] You don't need to search beyond the pentagram Everything is here, in fact, I'm a Wiccan - Wiccan? Yeah, Look, each one of these edges has a deep meaning So, you have the spirit, the earth, the air, the fire and the water I see, the five edges! Yes, exactly, so it's all here, this is all about us! Do you see us in there? You know, I'm also interested in esoteric things They help my intuition… So, let me see if I get this right The spirit represents the creative gods They guide us through our lives and through the rituals of magical work, if you're into that sort of stuff The earth represents the elementary powers the air, the intelligence, fire is the energy It means changes and mutation and water...emotion Exactly! So, you have a man surrounded by the full moon Which is just a circle, and the circle, It is also it's our goddess, our protector but then it's not enough just to know it No, definitely not! I've heard that you have a domain over the elements But you have it, you're a witch, you have that I think I’m sort of fire, that's me actually Impressive girl, Not what you expect from an escort service You know what? wipe that fucking smirk of your face, because I can cancel this appointment like that I didn't mean to offend you Appointment? Is that what we're having here? Whatever! Hey, show some respect There's money involved, remember? Jesus Christ! Of course they had to send me a Danish girl with such a temper Yeah? Well, then send me back! That's just the way I need to end my evening You know what? I'm leaving Please! Sit down, I'll behave [silence] [silence] You've got a pretty face Do you mind me saying that? Plus, you remind me of someone But you don't have any idea, do you? I think I know what kind of torment you have in your life Oh, you do it to me [giggles] I think I experienced it myself But maybe it's because I'm Jewish And I'm not so much into this Lutheran shit What's your point? I don't know if I have a point Okay You see the pentagram? Just rip it off! it's worthless! I see no union of the different ones What I mean is it's all about the sameness that we live in, this union of equals… I mean you, me, the queen, that's not union of the different ones Did I screw the pentagram now? I'm not naïve, you know I’m majored in people’s indifference Naive? Why would I think you're naive? You are a beautiful, voluptuous young lady with a face for an angel while I am a walking midlife crisis So, no matter how hard you try, you'll never get my indifference Tonight maybe not You are paying, aren't you? Yeah but somehow I don't really think you are interested in money you have this ribbon around your forehead which says “screw the perfect society” no, I like that! You think you know so much and I’m this… what? dumb girl eager to be in experienced arms of an older man? Okay, Beautiful then perhaps you could help me clear up something very odd that happened in this room just few hours ago What? What? [chokes] [footsteps going away] [silence] [miscellaneous noise] [keypad beeping] [water flushing] Hi, look I'm already here okay? No, you have to be patient… I can't talk right now Yeah, things are fucking up yeah, yeah, you can bet I will. [miscellaneous sounds] Are you feeling better? Yes, thanks! [footsteps approaching] No matter how fine your whiskey is, it always turns sour on your stomach when you mix it with other people's anguish And I had plenty tonight Anguish Before you were saying something about a strange thing in this room Yeah, just forget about it. I will think about it myself. Can I have a cigarette? yes, good idea. The pipe of peace [silence] [lighter ignites] [silence] [liguid pouring in the glass] What's your problem anyway? My problem? [giggles] The truth is… when it comes to personal relationships I'm totally fucked At least I get to see your beautiful smile [silence] You don't fit in anywhere, do you? why don't you just... I don't know disappear, go to the wild I don't know, get lost, like punks, tramps? [smiles] Well, do you fit in? You know the classic chick you saw on her way out? She just called me stupid and arrogant I say fuck her! I don't need her to validate myself. And fuck you too Beautiful! Yeah, I mean Don't you think that you are also standing out of the crowd with this look of a wealthy prostitute Fuck you Maybe that's why we love the American culture so much The Americans, they divide the world into winners and losers that may be cruel, but you can't blame the Americans for being insincere Fuck! Why can't we just be ourselves? We always need a confirmation from them [silence] You can only be a decent human being if you get confirmation, Beautiful Look, this talk is taking us nowhere We're not here for this crap anyway You're dangerous man! Oh, yeah! I'm a lost case if that's what's you mean, but to hell with that, I'm fire as well We are the transforming elements Come on To contrast and unbalance!

Are you gonna tell me? Well, she said she's a hooker, a prostitute, I hired her last night Very late last night, actually You know I was confused and Anna’s marriage, all that… Fuck, fuck, fuck! Look, this is... Beautiful! You know, this was her nickname I hired through a pimp, you know, I called an agency, an escort service I must have the number somewhere This is Jenny! Jenny Sorenson! What? Jenny Sorenson Do you know her? Yeah, I know her! but you should know her even better [silence] God no, fuck that! You know this can't be… just wait a minute, okay? I'm such an idiot, of course that's her! How come didn't you recognize her? You know, I called an escort service I was drunk, she was wearing this red wig I mean, the last time I saw her she was a teenager Definitely not equipped with this... [exhales] Woman's body, I mean… She was totally insane when she came to us you know, she had a summer job at the office three years ago, or something like that Just out of the blue she developed this crazy fixation on you and Anna found dozens of letters I don't know if you ever even read the but, you know… How do you know about the letters? I mean I can barely remember that how could you remember that? Gosh, she's so skinny [silence] Oh my God. What? Anna saw her last night, I'm sure she recognized her but you tell me that Anna was here in your house at the very night of her own wedding I know it's weird, but she was So was my mother This isn't going to well Are you sure Anna recognized her? Now? Quite sure! She had a long look at her, I thought she was jealous What then? [exhales] I just realized Jenny is Robert sister, therefore she's now officially Anna little sister-in-law Yeah, I just thought about that Well, she was, now she's dead Hey, don't talk like that! Show some respect! Okay, so, what are we going to do now? No, what are you going to do? You know, this situation isn't exactly easy calling the police under these circumstances it is quite complicated, you know, the story's quite hard to sell The little sister-in-law of your former fiancée is found dead in your house on the very next morning after Anna's wedding and you know, with bruises all over her body and around her neck and plus, there's an overdose of your medications Jesus! [faint music in background] I mean, the bruises can't be that bad She's so dammed white skin, can't you see? but of course I had to make this great scandal at Anna's wedding I mean, two cups threw me out on the street after taking my name What's the story with those bruises? Okay I drank too much stuff but not to the point of killing someone I don't remember the details though, I guess we had wild, steaming, hot sex, you know bondage shit, okay? But she wanted it! It was all you know, “tie me up”, “Spank me around”, sort of thing, you know “call me a whore”, which was totally unnecessary At least I thought so at the time “Spank me around”, sort of thing? The girl was wild, we had esoteric talks about witchcraft Such a shame! I mean, what a waste! [silence] [faint music in background] You know I could be easily in love with her [giggles] In love? it's very ironic to fall in love with a person that just committed suicide because she didn't get your love years ago this is just so much Hamse Leth You'll never change You only say that because she's dead No, I just don't get it! Why would she come back here after all those years I mean, was she really a prostitute sent at random to my house? A tragic coincidence which out of the blue made her rediscover all the sufferings she experienced three years ago because of me Out of the blue has got nothing to do with it? You know, this girl's paranoid Come on, admit it! You used her And you dumped her A normal girl would have killed you; a paranoid girl would kill herself Don't be so tragic! you know, I came here to talk about our company or even better the closing of our company Instead, I find the total ruin of our firm connected to the suspicious death of a young girl just because my partner can't stand a little pain in his chest and had to play kinky to death with a beautiful young girl I didn't kill her Let's call the police! [music in background starts] [distant hooting of sirens] [music continues in the background] [background music continues] [background music continues] [background music continues] [background music continues] [footsteps] [background music continues] [knocking at the door] [background music continues] Anybody in there?

You can't come in now, it's too late, okay No, it's not okay and don't boss on me I've been hired for something I really need to deliver I mean, I want to get paid and you wanted a lady, so here I am so make my day! Look, miss, it's really not my problem that you didn't show up last night. Actually, it's a big problem. but I'm fine, I'm ok, can you please leave? What that fuck? Holy shit! Now I see the problem Who are you? Niels, this is Beautiful! Who? She's the one I really hired or at least should have hired, but it doesn't matter now. Things are pretty fucked up, but at least they clearer on that point Why did you sleep with Jenny, then? yeah, well maybe you can explain that? First of all, I need to take my medicine He panics So, her name was Jenny What about you? What about you? Are you a cop? Is she dead as she seems? No, not actually Yes, she is pretty dead Hello, wouldn't it be a better idea if somebody called the police? We were just about to take care of that, you know, we're private investigators We just need to adjust little things, a little few things, before we call them, you know you shouldn't… don't worry! Things are in very good hands here I see I've just a little few things like, removing the proofs from the crime scene? This is not happening, I'm not witnessing shut the fuck up! you're not going anywhere else and we found out what happened to that girl before she went through that door [giggles] Listen guys I don't know much I'm in shock it was about 3 in the morning this poor thing grabbed my arms the moment I was about to ring the bell right there She said she was this guy's girlfriend and that he wasn't behaving well or something like that Anyway, she wanted to play a trick on him and she asked for my wig and said she would pay me three thousand crowns afterwards we were supposed to meet on the street corner the money was doubled of what I’d get to sleep with him Why shouldn't I believe her? such a fine girl, so well-dressed The only reason why I'm here is to do my job and get paid It's my only job is this whole miserable week Listen Beautiful, I know that you are mad, but we have a very delicate situation here I'll give you whatever money we agreed on but we have a priority I know, I'm not blind I just want to puke thinking that it could have been me spread on that sofa It was an accidental death Nobody killed anybody So was it? but she has as many spots as a leopard on her white skin that's your expertise isn't it? the whole “fruit code” Your friend at the agency told me that it was the full package bondage, spanking and a fair amount of sadism Does that explain the leopard picture for you? Okay, I know a “two-fruit code” can be very risky especially in the hands of inexperienced customers they should have told you that I arrived just before you stepped in and I found that girl on his bedroom [giggles] Okay boys, I can help you through this I'm part of the team now I need to get paid though Wait a minute, wait a minute There'll be no team, not with me, you know - What come on? - No? I'm only here to have a work meeting with Hamse It's got nothing to do with your proposed love triangle I don't know I think I was quite tormented last night One thing I do know she was no sweet heart of yours So fucked up! [silence] You really killed her, didn’t you? I can see it clear now I've had enough, I'm leaving [closet opens] [closet closes] [footsteps] Nobody leaves this house until I know what happened [falling on the ground] What's wrong with you? [silence] [exhales] [silence] [water splashing on face] [exhales] [closet opens] [closet closes] [drinking water] [closet closes] It doesn't mean, you know, he's just scared Hamse is a total disaster but it's not a violent man He'll come back, you know, totally change You'll see [silence] [places the bottle on shelf] [silence] [silence] [background music starts] [background music continues] [background music continues] [background music continues] [background music continues] Holy shit! Jesus Christ! Sometimes I think I've experienced too much How come I still get surprised? Since I arrived in this country, I've seen living people look very diseased but I haven't seen a dead so alive [background music continues] [background music continues] Well, this is what you wanted, right? Okay, you are part of the team now but you have to play it right I mean, very well or you will regret it Listen, my partner is a totally insane person as you saw for yourself I don't care He's ruining my life and I won't let that happen if you keep your mouth shut I'll give you a reward I'll take the girl from here, no one will come looking for her because in truth, as you saw there's nothing to look for All I need, is a couple of days to convince him to leave this country, okay? Don't do bossing on me, okay! So, is that your plan? Of course, it's not my plan It is what's left of my plan There should be no you, no Anna, no Margretha Fuck! If only Hamse wasn't so fucking unpredictable How come you hate him that much? But what about you? Do you know exactly what you're here for? I see you don't need that much money but you're still gonna need a heart beating inside your chest once you walk out that door Don't play the humanitarian! You are pure greed aren't you? but don't worry I'm a prostitute, remember? and you can bet I'm okay with that Yes, I'm in! I have a heart, but I've got needs I see that you're already much better Please, forgive me! and now, where were we? Well, the last time you were seen in this room you were holding a gun in your hands Oh, yes, it's true, how cold I forget? You know, no matter what we do Hamse, we have to do it fast I've been thinking of ways out of this mess when you were away You have? How does South America sounds to you? The Amazon? What? Neils, this is not one of your detective games We're talking about my life here, be reasonable! I know, but… I'll take Jenny's body I'll bring it to my house and I'll keep it for a couple of days and that will give you enough time to get out of here or even out of the country then I'll bring it back put her in here where all the evidence will be found and where she was seen last. Eventually of course the police will find her but you'll be long gone by then In other words, Hamse must disappear, vanish Are you out of your fucking mind? Let me explain! With my contacts, I can even get you a visa as a Lutheran missionary Yeah, I know you're Jewish, but you know that's just a detail We'll have to change your name anyway And, of course, Margretha will be the only one who knows apart from the three of us Come on, Hamse, admit it! This is what you always wanted You never really had a place here This is a life chance to live a whole new life story [claps] Perfect! So I can just trade my old life in for a new one Niels, you really surprise me It's not the money Eventually, you would get the company for yourself, anyway No, it's the fact that as long as I'm around you will still be a grimy reverse reflection in the mirror You hate yourself because you can't stand wanting to be me you got detective skills for sure, but I've got the intuition that makes the difference Just don't come around with this Amazonian Indiana Jones’ crap You want me out of the game and that's it! you know, I see no game here I see a real life in real fucking jeopardy It's my life [silence] Thank you! [background music starts] [background music continues] ♪♪♪ [car approaching] [car stops] [background music continues] I admit, I killed her I mixed too much alcohol with my medicine and surprise!!! I turned into a monster Mister Hyde took possession of me Dr. Jack wasn't man enough to satisfy such a voluptuous woman Come on friends, I know you understand me. I had to ask a little help from my inhuman friend and the results lies on this sofa [silence] [loads the gun] [footsteps] No!!! [silence] As you see, nothing is exactly what it seems! You can lower the gun, it is finished As you see, Beautiful nothing is indeed as it seems Son of a bitch! I studied the pentagram, remember? I paid closer attention this time I know enough about mystical symbols to see that you didn’t draw it in a, let's say, positive way You drew it upside down, Jenny Which as you know, doesn't exactly mean the highest spiritual aspiration you wanted me to believe Take a deep breath, you must be tired You did it well, girl Unnecessary to remind a beautiful wannabe witch that the two edges of the pentagram looking upwards actually represent the symbol of the horny god Do you know what the horny god is, Beautiful? The horny god is at the same time both light and dark the one who dies and always reborn the horny god is also the god of fertility, which is an appropriate reference to the lust we shared last night If you know it so well then what the fuck am I doing here? Yes, I actually got to the point of telling why you've been so supportive of my disaster? Fuck you! I deserve your hatred You are crazy about me I could have easily manipulated you, petted you and made the circumstances much less painful instead I ignored your cry for help and disappeared out of your life although I was actually never in I left you in the hands of the devil to perform one of his most despicable acts I didn't rescue you but who could have saved you from your own homemade demons? Stop! Especially when your brother was to play the part of the devil Robert? [faint music in background] You'd only been in the office a short time it's amazing that I can barely remember you there, but I seem to remember a few times your brother came to pick you up Your emerging beauty didn't go unnoticed by your brother Robert So, what did you want to tell me with this sudden desperate exhibition of love? Why all the letters? Was it really love you expected from me or would a helping hand have done it? Stop! Stop! Shut the fuck up, okay? I'm sorry Jenny but in the inverted pentagram the horny god is also the “incestuous god” The son and the lover of the supreme goddess [woman crying] You can't forgive me, can you? But can you forgive yourself? It's not use now I used her body The same body I couldn't recognize a few years later So, you see Niels I'm a sinner just like you We're actually quite alike Is that what you were hoping for?

I... wait Things are different now [background music continues] All right, it’s over! Why? Fuck, maybe I just want to live [background music continues] [road noise] Thus, lying on his own sidewalk and while embraced in the young and beautiful arms of Jenny He was totally aware that as it had often happened He would die once more!
