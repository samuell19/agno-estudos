- Ready to go, Sergeant? - Yes, sir. Move out. Let's move out! This is what is left of Love Company 23rd Infantry, U.S. Army my company. I'm Sergeant Otto Ludwig. It's December 1944. We're in a village in the Ardennes forest in Belgium. We're busy with a counterattack which the allies are launching against Hitler in the battle of the Bulge. We were lucky to escape the ice and the snow that covered most of the Bulge. Then our luck ran out. We did not escape one of Hitler's secret weapons. It all started in the fall of 1944 near Stalag 12 somewhere in Germany. Fellas, let 'em have it! Atta boy, Joe! Atta boy! Come on! You! Americans! Don't try to get away or you'll get shot! Come on, yanks! Get under the truck before our own planes think we're krauts! You are prisoners of war. I have given you an order to stay on the truck. Don't try to escape, or I will have you shot. You! There! Under there! Come out! Ha ha. You are very fortunate that we respect the Geneva convention. Otherwise, I would have you shot. Right now, all of you! All privileges are canceled. Every morning, after roll call, you will report to me for fatigue duty, when you are so fatigued you cannot stand perhaps you'll wish I had shot you. - What was... - Into the truck! The American air raids are suicidal! The last desperate kicks of a dying man. Three hundred B-17s were destroyed definitely over Frankfurt yesterday increasing the count of 2,508 planes destroyed in a period of one week. On the ground, the enemy has been stopped in his tracks and demoralized. Thousands are surrendering daily. Soon, the German army will be on the march again. And they will not be halted until we have pushed the enemy back into the sea. Heil Hitler. Keep pumping, boy. Don't give up now. It's like breathing in a suitcase down there. This isn't an air conditioning unit, you know. Gimme some more oleo for this can. Okay, I'll give you another wick. It was tough fight, Marv, but I won. - You did it, Richardson! You did it! - Take it easy. - If you had a shave, I'd kiss you. - Hey, Sarge! Richie's back! Lookie here! Tonight, we celebrate. You guys gimme your D bars and I'll make you the greatest chocolate cake you ever tasted. I bet the mud in there tastes better than that cake. Gimme another crack at it, fellers. Last time, I didn't have no rising. That's what my trouble was. You haven't any now, either. Oh, yes I do, tooth powder. - What? - I figured it out, tooth powder. It's got sodium bicarbonate in it. I'd like to eat some cake, not brush my teeth. Do you think that'll help? You said you could do it. I couldn't let you do everything, Sarge. You swiped that map and those civilian clothes. I had to earn my keep somehow. Didn't those characters wonder at all why you volunteered for that detail? I told you there was nothing to worry about. There's just too much rubble to be cleaned up these days, for them to look a gift horse in the mouth. Hast du eine Zigarette? Ja, natuerlich. Ich habe einen Schnaps. Schnaps? All clear. Excuse me. Well, now that, uh now that Richie gave us this little beauty we ought to be breaking our way out of here in a couple of weeks. So tonight and every night until we're ready to go I'm gonna sit over you guys while you study German. - German! - That's right, German. There's over 50 miles between us and our lines. If we get stopped along the way, a couple of the right words in German might save our necks. - Sarge? - You're gonna do the talking for us, aren't you? He's right, Sarge. No matter how hard we cram on that Deutsch, we ain't gonna fool nobody. And if I get killed, we get separated you may just have to be on your own. The time's too short now not to take advantage of every minute. Sarge is right. How about that chocolate cake? That ain't gonna hurt none. We'll worry about celebrating later, after we've made it out of here. - Let's get to work, Virgil. - I'll be right back I'm wanted in the dispensary for a typhus shot or something. Virgil! We gotta get some boards. We're gonna be shoring up in a little while. Aufmachen! Danke. Lassen Sie den Gefangenen eintreten. Jawohl, Herr Obergruppenfuehrer. - Schicken Sie den Gefangenen herein. - Jawohl. In here. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Now, now, Bruno, quiet. This is Lieutenant Von Kroner. Once they train these dogs to hate the smell of the American uniform - there's no changing them. - It's all right. Please sit down, Lieutenant. - Cigarette? - No, thank you, sir. How's the digging going? Well, if they don't run into rock or have a cave-in they'll be on the other side of the wall in two weeks. That's earlier than I expected. They have a spade shovel now, Colonel. As a matter of fact, I stole it for them while I was on Steiner's detail this morning. - You did? - I thought I'd better. They weren't getting suspicious of you, were they? Ludwig mentioned me to those new prisoners from the 13th Infantry but found out that none of them knew me. Why should they? There's a lot of men in a regiment. I know, but it takes just a whiff of something for Ludwig to start wondering. I wanted to counteract that. The others I can understand. Ludwig I can't. He's a German, one of us. Well, not exactly, Colonel. America is only his place of birth. He has German blood the same heritage. He even speaks German. I know. Perhaps he's really a Jew, just too shrewd to admit it. Anyhow, he'll be sorry when he finds us waiting for him at the other end of that tunnel. Forgive me, Colonel. Must we wait for them to finish their tunnel? Why not raid them now? They won't get away. - I know that. - Then what worries you? The radio said that 12 English prisoners were executed after being caught escaping from Aachen. No. It couldn't be. What couldn't be, Colonel? Suddenly flashing before me, was the history I learned at military school how empires were lost because the victors identified themselves with the countries they occupied and were eventually absorbed by them. - Are you implying, sir, that I've become... - Fond of those prisoners? No. I said it couldn't be. Not with your background, with a father like yours. But to put your mind at ease I have no intention of executing Ludwig or his group. Letting them dig a tunnel is simply a good way of keeping them busy of keeping them from digging a tunnel we don't know about. I'm sorry, Colonel. In any event, I don't imagine the prisoners here will be of any interest to you from now on. This just arrived. Orders from the Fuhrer himself to move all English-speaking personnel to Castle Freihof. - I'm being transferred? - A special English-speaking brigade is being formed there by Colonel Skorzeny. - Skorzeny who... - Who kidnapped Mussolini. - When do I leave here, Colonel? - At 23:00 tonight. We'll come for you. Pretend we are sending you to Stalag Zughoff. Your old uniform will be waiting for you in the supply room - but take that one with you. - I will. You'll go by train as far as Frankfurt. From there, by bus. And, oh, yes, you are under orders not to mention - the nature of your journey to anyone. - I won't, sir. That's all, then. If you write your father, give him my personal regards. I will, sir. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Good dog. That smell has gone away now, hasn't it, Bruno? Not far from Berlin was Castle Freihof. Here, 150 men were to be trained under Colonel Skorzeny's supervision. The operation was called "Okay Butch." Aside from the German high command and Hitler himself operation Okay Butch was a complete secret. Not even the trainees, selected from all branches of the German forces had any idea of its true nature. Lieutenant Von Kroner was anxiously looking forward to the part he was to play. Good day, Sir. You just arrived? - Yes, this morning. - I came in last night. There's lots of fun in store for us. Have you heard the rumors? - About kidnapping Eisenhower? - No about us blowing up the White House. - Blowing up the White House? - Yes. We'll be landed in Washington by submarine. Roosevelt is our target. - I hadn't heard. - Well, you will. - Lieutenant Wilitz is my name. - Von Kroner. Von Kroner. Not related to General Von Kroner? - He's my father. - Well isn't that something? I followed General Von Kroner's career for many years. Hero at Verdun in the last war, an iron man in Russia now. - You should really be proud. - Yes, I am. Attention! Gentlemen may I introduce Major Von Ruppel who has been assigned by Colonel Skorzeny to supervise your training - and give you your orders. - At ease. Be seated. Before I tell you why you've been summoned here let me read this message from the Fuhrer. "Defenders of the third Reich, "I want to greet you "and express the faith that, in the historic role you are about to play "you will cover yourself with honor and glory "and prove once again that there is no greater soldier in the world "than the German soldier." We are the best soldiers in the world and the moment is here to prove it by delivering a crippling blow to the enemy that could end the war. Here we are at the present, behind the west wall. The British Second army is here. The American Ninth army is here. The American First and Third armies here. However, here in the Ardennes forest the enemy maintains only a token line and they believe that we will never strike there. Intelligence reports it is nothing more than a ghost sector. A swift hammer blow here would split the allies in half allow us to cut off 10 to 15 divisions in a trap north of Antwerp and throw the whole western front into a rout. What part do you play in it? The moment our panzers break through you will infiltrate the enemy lines in American uniforms and with American equipment. Your objective: create confusion terror havoc by every means possible. Until the moment you are ready to move to the front you will be trained to look like Americans act like Americans eat and sleep like Americans, even breathe like Americans. That's all I have to say for now except good luck and keep faith in our Fuhrer! Thank you. Attention! - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. We know you speak English or you wouldn't be here but you'll never pass as an American, until you've mastered the letter "R." The American does not roll the "R." It is "razor," "arrive," "beer." Very good. At ease. An American does not click his heels. Proceed. It was a strange sight. Germans learning American pronunciation G.I. slang intelligence methods the use of American weapons and equipment and the way to sabotage them. Don't offer everyone a cigarette. Ask for one. Flip the package. An endless stream of instructions in every detail. Chew gum. Enjoy it. Erasing stubborn accents, though, came the hardest and Von Ruppel realized early that he'd have to rely on his group leaders to do the talking during the operation. Leaders especially chosen for their English fluency. Lieutenant Von Kroner? Lieutenant, thank you for your assistance in training our men. The fact that you grew up in America has persuaded us that you would make a good Commander Leader, in a most important mission. These are the three men who will be under you. They were each chosen for special ability. Wilitz is a master of explosives, and lived in Milwaukee for some years. I've met Wilitz. Kirsch is expert with electrical equipment. He will handle the radio and know just how to sabotage enemy communications and power installations. Hoffner, he will be your driver. He is a mechanic. We want you to become a team as quickly as possible. I understand, Colonel Von Ruppel. Very good. Very American. No heel clicking. Chews gum. I don't think our trust in the General's son has been misplaced. Thank you, sir. I must take a picture of myself in this American uniform. - Me too. Who has a camera? - Muller next door to us has one. You all have a complete uniform and dog tags. Those uniforms were taken from prisoners of war so make certain all markings have been removed. Now look at your dog tags. The name on it from now on will be your name. You will learn it and everyone else's between now and the day we shove off. Most important note your rank and serial number. Brett Barton, Corporal. Lester B. Hyland. - P.F.C. - What do you know? James Aggajanian P.F.C. We'll call you Jim, if you don't mind. What's your name, Von Kroner? Leonard S. Richardson. Sergeant Richardson. Isn't that the name you used at Stalag? I still have Richardson's uniform, saves supply another issue. And saves you from having to remember a name like Aggajanian. We fall out for inspection in 20 minutes. Let's get into the uniforms. Von Kroner. We must be getting ready to push off if they're giving these out. I haven't been told anything. Thanksgiving would be the time to hit those Americans while they're eating their turkey and dreaming. Those gangsters would have the warmest celebration they ever had. I'll bet we could go clear to Paris, kidnap Eisenhower anyway. Look. I hope it's a picnic for us, but I wouldn't underestimate those Americans. They're not stupid, and they're not soft. I wouldn't let General Von Kroner hear you say that. My father's in Russia. I spent eight 8 months in Stalag 12 with Americans. That's what I mean, eight months, and not one of them caught on you were a spy. How smart can they be? I was lucky. There were other spies who weren't who ended up in the hospital. All right, we'll send a telegram to Eisenhower - and tell him not to worry after all. - No. Let him worry. - He quits? - I'm broke. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. We'll play for fun, but just to make it interesting the winner of each hand gets to whack the loser across the fingers like this. Come on, put out your finger. It's a game we used to play in the beer garden. I've had enough. Afraid? - I'm not afraid. - Come on, then, deal. Look. When there's something to win, I'll play. Whacking you across the fingers isn't my idea of winning anything. I have to do something besides sit around and wait. Hasn't anyone even given you a hint of when we're leaving? - Soon, that's all. - Soon. Thanksgiving would have been the time. - We'll get our chance. Don't worry. - When? Waiting can drive a man crazy. He's not fooling. Every day, there's a rumor we're going, and then here we are again. Stop listening to rumors. Well, you don't know which is a rumor and which isn't. Tonight. Tonight would be a good night to attack also. In that fog out there, they'd never see us. We'd catch them while they were asleep. - That's the way we worked in Berlin. - What kind of work was that? Taking care of traitors and Jews. You were a brown shirt? And you should have seen the expressions on their faces when we broke in on them. They looked like surprised cows at the slaughterhouse. It's one of the few jobs I ever had, I would have done for nothing. We're all out of beer. Come in. Herr commandant requests Lieutenant Von Kroner's presence immediately. Thank you, Franz. Orders for tomorrow, probably. Oh, I'll, uh I'll bring back some beer for you. Thanks. Here are the orders for group 5 11. This must be Von Kroner. Bring him in. This way. Lieutenant Von Kroner reporting, sir. You mean Sergeant Richardson. Yes, sir. Thank you, Bruger. Sergeant, these are the credentials you and your men will carry. They cover almost any situation that might arise in phase one of the operation. If asked to show your papers, don't hesitate. Yes, sir. Now, these orders you will carry alone and they are the most important of all. Correct timing is essential. On notification that phase two of our operation has begun you will deliver them to the American commander at Namur. Here a few miles from Namur are three bridges crossing the river Meuse. The American commander, we are certain, will have them destroyed if he is forced to withdraw from this sector. We cannot allow this to happen. Our panzers must get across the river without breaking stride in order to strike at Antwerp before any resistance can be organized there. These orders direct the Commander to leave the bridges intact. I understand. You cannot fail. The high command has promised Antwerp to Hitler for a Christmas present. I'll do my best. Anything else, sir? Yes. Be at the lecture room at 04:00 for a final briefing. Hitler has alerted all units to prepare to attack. Roaring cannons along an 80-mile front served as the alarm clock for thousands of sleeping Americans in the early-morning hours of December 16th. The Germans call the all-out blitzkrieg that followed "Watch on the Rhine." It took the allies completely by surprise. We reeled back in confusion, uncertainty and panic. While most of the area was covered with snow, the northwest route near the river Meuse was heavy with fog and rain. Fourteen hours later, Skorzeny's men began filtering through our lines. Speak English. You know the orders. Speak English at all times. - Where are you going? - Special orders for Colonel Ronisson. Okay, proceed. We learned later that the German commandos resorted to every trick in the book. They'd switch our warning signs from mined roads barring us from our escape routes and sending many unsuspecting G.I.'s to their death. You'll have to cut through that section. This has all been mined. Through that section! Systematic destruction of our oil dumps ammo depots communication centers changed a retreat into a rout. No trouble at all. Just dropped the package in the wastebasket. Get in. - Where to? - We'll try to find someplace to sleep tonight and in the morning, we'll head for Namur and those bridges. - You hear from headquarters? - The second phase of our operation has begun. We'd better check it. Wilitz, Kirsch. I hope there's some heat in there. My hands are freezing. Yeah, so are mine. Qu'est-ce que c'est? Do you speak English? Yes. We're Americans. My buddies and I need a place to spend the night. Do you have any room? Yes. Come in, please. Come in. Take a look around. I'm afraid we'd freeze if we had to sleep out there tonight. You're welcome. There is plenty of room here. - Pierre? - Oui, Monique. - The good wine. - Oui, Monique. - Please, make yourself at home. - Thank you. I was helping my brother with his lessons. You mean with all the fighting going on outside, you still worry about lessons? My father made me promise to keep up Pierre's schooling. No matter what happened. He believed that learning should never stop. It's the only real weapon we have to stop Hitler. - Your father's a wise man. - Yes. - Where is your father? - Taken by the Germans for slave labor. - He and my older brother. - Are they alive? I don't know. I never received any news. - Then you and the boy are the only ones here. - Yes. It could be dangerous just you two alone with the Germans heading this way. Perhaps but Pierre and I will never give up our house. Anyway, the Colonel said they might not reach here. What Colonel? There was some American soldiers here the other night like you. The Colonel, he said that it's the fog that's protecting the Germans. As soon as it lifts, the American planes will be able to fly again and smash their attack. I hope so but did he say anything about the Luftwaffe? They might have something to say about that. The Luftwaffe has been destroyed. We don't see their planes anymore. They could be holding them back. No, they are finished. And the fog must lift soon. I have asked for few things from God so that when there was something important he would not refuse me. I prayed all last night that the fog would disappear and I will pray again tonight. Monsieur, please, your wine. Good morning. - Did I wake you? - No. I wanted to see you alone before we left. I watched you all last night. I said if I didn't talk to you I would regret it all my life. Talk to me about what? Well, not talk, exactly. You're very pretty, Monique. I dreamed of you. - Thank you, but... - Just a little kiss and make it come true. - No, please, I can't. - The others are asleep, we'll be quiet. No! - Come on, Monique. - I'll have some coffee ready in a few minutes. I'm an American soldier. You said last night you Belgians owed us a great deal. - Not this, please. - You have a boyfriend. - No. - Then what is there to worry about? Please, if you don't stop, I'll wake the others. What is this? Who are you fooling? You probably said yes to a dozen Americans before me. - Is there something wrong with me? - No! No! No! No! No! - She was asking for it. - Yes, I can see that. Go get the jeep ready. Look, Monique, I promise you he'll be punished for this. I'll be all right. Americans. See? The fog has disappeared. Looks like your prayers have been answered. Yes. Monique, I want to thank you for everything. It's the war. It sometimes makes... Blame it on the war. Well, I've never seen so many American planes. I am not worried, wait until they run into the Luftwaffe. Go straight through the village. Halt! - What's the matter? - What outfit you guys with? - 106th division. - What's the national league? - What? - The national league. Are you kidding? It's a baseball league. What is this, 20 questions? A lot of Germans have been coming through here dressed like Americans. Look, I told you, we're with the 106th. We'll show you our papers. We had to hightail it out of Saint-Vith. - Who is Popeye's girlfriend? - Olive Oyl and she looks a whole lot better than you - if you want a description. - I guess you fellas are okay. - Through there. - What gives? - We had orders to drive to... - Your orders have been changed. Through there. Yes, I'm all set to go. Thanks. - Well, Wheeler, things are looking up. - Good. The airborne is holding at Bastogne. Captain? Four men from the 106th, sir. From the Saint-Vith area. - Really rough, eh? - Yes, sir. - We took quite a clobbering. - We've all had our licks. This company is down to one rifle platoon and half of a weapons platoon and what you see here is my headquarters. - Sir, we've got orders to drive to Namur. - Your orders are changed. The 106th division is no longer intact and until we can get you back to your outfit, stick with us. We can use you. - But, sir, the orders... - As of now, you'll be attached to us. - Love Company, 23rd infantry. - Well, I guess there's no argument. Where are we heading, sir? Your platoon Sergeant will brief you. Corporal, take these men to the second platoon. Yes, sir. This way, men. - They've got wheels, Captain. - Oh? Better leave that jeep. We need it. Yes, sir. Well, Lieutenant, one jeep is better than none, eh? Wait till you meet the Sergeant, a real good apple. He broke out of prison camp, and instead of hightailing it for home he asked to be sent back into action. I'll find him for you. - What do we do? - We'll sneak out of here later. After we find out where they're attacking. Sergeant? I have some more help for you. Well, we can use it. All right, men, over here, around the corner. - Well, what do you know? Hey, Sarge, look here! - Ludwig! Ennis! I never thought I'd see you guys again! Richie, you old dog! How are you? What are you doing' here? You're supposed to be in Zughoff. They transferred me there, all right, but they couldn't keep me. I wasn't gonna get cheated out of escaping. I went out with a laundry truck one night. Inside someone's dirty mattress cover. Well, a lot sweeter-smelling than our tunnel. We ran into a cesspool before we got out no one would come near us for days. Where are the others? How's Manning, Clark and Wilson? - They get shipped home? - Uh, no, we, uh... We're the only ones who made it. - They got caught? - Not that lucky. The krauts found out about our tunnel. They were waiting for us at the other end. No warning, nothing, they just opened up on us with a machine gun. Aw, no. Yeah, it was pretty awful. Well, it could be some of the guys are still alive, but I strongly doubt it. I'll never know how we made it. We just kept runnin', duckin' and prayin'. It's just an excuse for murder like those executions at Aachen. Yeah. Only this way the commandant doesn't have to worry about being charged with a war crime. He knew exactly what he was doing. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Well, there's nothin' we can do about it now. Except out there. - What are our orders, Sarge? - Maybe I can show you a little better on the map. Now, we're right here in this town. At noon, we move up behind the line of departure, that's right here. - Yeah. - At 08:00 hours tomorrow morning, this company leaves the regiment, and we're to seize and secure this crossroads right here. The Germans are on this small hill and they're controlling the crossroads - and we're gonna have to move them off. - When do we move? We move out at 12:00 hours. It's now 10:15. You guys got just about enough time to grab some chow before we move out. - Thanks. Nice to see you guys again. - See you later, Richie. Hey, new meat! - Welcome to lovelost company. - Hi. - Shall we dine? - Yes, but first we'll pick up our Sunday dishes. - Hey, Where you fellas goin'? - We'll be right back, Captain's orders. Okay. Have joined Rifle company, Second Infantry division. Company strength, approximately 60 men. Mission is to attack tomorrow seize crossroads at coordinates EK-2-7-5-1-0-3-9-5. Major allied attack to begin on seizure of crossroads. H hour is 08:00. Should we return to our lines? Over. - Return to our lines? - I think it'd be a good idea. - Why? - Well, it looks like our blitzkrieg has run out of gas. If we don't hurry back, we're liable to find ourselves trapped here. You don't really believe our panzers have been stopped? Yes, I do. Just wait until they get some help from the Luftwaffe. Well, they may wait a long time. What do you mean? I haven't seen the Luftwaffe in months. I thought they were being held back but I'm convinced now they were only written on paper. Oh, your father would be ashamed of you if he heard the way you are talking. You really get a pleasure out of killing, don't you? - Killing Americans. - Killing. This war's an excuse for you to be drunk, powerful. You're like that commandant, who could have let those prisoners go back but he chose to execute them instead. - They were trying to escape. - They were caught. That commandant knew about them in advance. I'll tell you something. I respect what that commandant did. He gave an object lesson to all the other prisoners who might have been thinking of escaping, too. There are certain rules in war. Let the Americans follow them. While they're bogged down in rules and sentimentality Germans like me are doing what we must. - That's why we'll win the war. - I have a message. Headquarters wants us to stay with the company and see to it they don't take that crossroads. Acknowledge. Then tell them we're destroying our radio. We'll booby-trap the jeep as long as we're gonna lose it. All set. - It'll go off in an hour. - That ought to be just about right. - Let's take care of the weapons carrier. - Later, one at a time. - Hey, where you guys been? - Tryin' to find some more men from the 106th, but no luck. We're ready to move out. The old man's at the head of the column now. Come on! - Ready to go, sergeant? - Yes, sir. Move out. Let's move out! Sergeant, halt the company. Take 10. Let's get the jeep. I want to check the scouts. Send back the word! Send up the jeep! Send up the jeep! Send up the jeep! Send up the jeep! Send up the jeep! What's the matter, Corporal? I don't know, sir. We've got plenty of gas, I'm sure of that. - Better check the motor. - Yes, sir. It may be the gas line on the fuel pump. Nothing simple, eh? Well, we can't take the time to fool around with it. We'll have to leave it. But, captain, we just got this jeep. Staubern, we'll just have to walk. - Come on, let's push this thing out of the way. - Yes, sir. All right, a couple of you fellas, lend a hand. - They're gonna leave it. - It looks that way. - Only one more minute! - You got a butt? Uh, Captain. Maybe if I blew out the fuel tank. It'd only take a minute, sir. Okay, Staubern, make it snappy. Good work, Staubern. - I'll be right back, sir. I just want to get my rifle. - Never mind. I'll take it. It must have been one of those teller mines they hit. Our mine teams have been through here, haven't they, sir? They must have missed it. What a lousy way to go! There isn't any good way, is there? Pinwheel, this is Pinwheel 3. How do you read me? Over. Pinwheel, this is Pinwheel 3. How do you read me? Over! Pinwheel, this is Pinwheel 3. Just checking the set. Thank you. Out. - Well, this is all right, anyway. - Yeah. I think that's the captain's map case back there. Here you are, Lieutenant. You're in charge now. Detail some men to clear the road and cover them. Yes, sir. Go ahead! I'll be all right. Go ahead! Oh, Lieutenant, they've spotted some krauts up ahead, sir. Charlie 2, This is Charlie. How many Germans do you think are there? Over. This is Charlie 2. Maybe six or seven. There may be a lot more, though. They're holed up in an old inn controlling crossroad and canal lock. Over. This is Charlie. Do you spot any heavy arms? Over. - This is Charlie 2. Just rifles and Tommy guns. Over. - This is Charlie. Okay, stay where you are. We'll take care of it. Out. Halt the column. Pull the third squad and the machine-gun section. We've got some business up ahead. Virgil, halt the rest of the column. This is the chance I've been waiting for. It's what we've all been waiting for. We'll operate in pairs. You work with me. All right, third squad, let's get with it! Cover the rear! Let's move out! Hyland, James, follow me! Lieutenant? Gomez, Fielding. Get in there. Brown, Stockwell, go with them! You guys cover 'em! You five, let's move out! Keep moving! Keep moving! Don't give 'em a target! Don't give 'em a target! Hit the dirt, men! All right, let's go get 'em! Let's go. Keep yourself covered! All right, all right. Okay, Hyland, James, frisk 'em. How about that, Sarge? Old men and little boys! Hitler reached for the bottom of the barrel. It look like he ain't gonna go down the drain without takin' the whole country with him. All right, men, I need a volunteer to take them to Battalion. I'll do it, Sergeant. Good, Richie. We'll bivouac about a mile and a half up the road. You can catch up with us there. Well, Lieutenant Wheeler's dead, so I guess I'm in charge now. I, uh, know something about the Germans. I'll try to make it work for us. The rest depends on you. How badly you want to get home. How badly you want to get this war over with. I'm making a speech. It's cold, let's go. - Hey, is Richie back yet? - No, not yet. - Well, I guess I'll just have to save him a piece then. - What is it? - Chocolate cake. You boys want to try some? - No. Come on, don't be afraid of it. Try it. It's my own special recipe. - Is this what you ate in the prison camp? - Unh-unh, much better! Couldn't get the cake to rise over at the prison camp. Tooth powder did the trick. Too bad the Lieutenant and the Captain can't enjoy none of it. - Hey, you guys want seconds? - No. - No, thanks. - See you later. Come here, Harold! Don't you run away now! The weapons carrier is next as soon as Richardson gets back. I gotta get the taste of that out of my mouth. There he is. - You, uh, deliver them all right? - Yeah. They're at Battalion now. You'd better have a good story of how they escaped. They didn't escape. I'm not joking. They're at Battalion. - What do you mean? - They didn't want to escape. As far as they were concerned, the war was lost. The blitzkrieg smashed, and the American planes tearing them to pieces. There was no use fighting anymore. Those filthy traitors! You should have shot them. - Maybe. - They'll end up telling Battalion about us. I don't think so. They were kids and grandfathers. They shouldn't have been called into the army in the first place. They were Germans! They could have pulled a trigger! They could have helped us! Well, we'll just have to help ourselves and hope there aren't too many others like them. I'd better report to Ludwig. They were children and grandfathers, not soldiers! The panzers will be an entirely different story! Sergeant, what are you doin' walkin' around? Checking the guard. What's the matter, don't you boys need any sleep? Too cold to sleep. Old Virgil was sayin' this is one time he wouldn't mind if somebody gave him a hotfoot. - Hotfoot? - Yeah. That Ennis is a real joker. I wouldn't mind having a hotfoot myself. Yeah. Well, we're moving out at 04:00. You better try to get some sleep, anyway. Don't you know what a hotfoot is? - I forgot. I don't think he suspected anything. - I hope not. All right, you ready? Let's go. - It's only us. - Cold tonight, huh? Yes, it is. Hey, Sarge! Must have been some German commandos. What you lookin' for, Sarge? They didn't sneak in here just to kill a guard. They may have been after this truck. You think maybe they booby-trapped it? Could be. When does that bomb go off? In about three minutes. Get that on there. That's it! All right, everybody back 50 yards! Sarge, it may go off any minute! - Get out of here! That's an order! - Let's get out of here! You all right, Sarge? Warm, for the first time, anyway. Give me a hand up, Virg. Whew, thank you. Okay, boys, back to bed. The show's over. - Here you are, Virgil, a present for you. - You're too good to me, Sarge. Sarge? Maybe these eyes were playin' tricks with me. A guy can imagine a lot of things at night. Go on. Go on. I might have been asleep but I thought I saw the guys that were foolin' around the truck. Come on, boy, keep talkin'. What'd they look like? I could have sworn they was Americans. They was wearin' our uniforms. Boy, you can't tell who's your friend and who's out to slit your throat. Don't talk like that, boy. It's unnerving. The truth is I thought first they was Richardson and that friend of his. What's his name. Barton, Corporal Barton. Yeah. It's a funny thing about him. I was talkin' to him a little while ago and he didn't seem to know what a hotfoot was. At least, I don't think he did. Oh! Come on Sarge. You don't think he and Richie are really Germans, now, do you? He said he was from the 13th regiment, but nobody from the 13th seemed to know him. He was the one man that was transferred out just in time to miss the machine-gunning. But, Sarge, if Richie is a German he would have freed them prisoners long before they reached Battalion now, wouldn't he? Yeah. Yep, you're right. Staubern, get me the point, will you? Charlie 2, this is Charlie. Over. Charlie 2, this is Charlie. Wait one. Charlie 2, where are you? Over. This is Charlie 2. We've reached the crossroads. They're dug in pretty good up here. Over. Charlie 2, this is Charlie. Any concealment up there? Over. This is Charlie 2. Only on one side. Over. Charlie 2, this is Charlie. We'll be up to take a look. Out. - Take a break, Bill. - All right. Come on, Virgil. If only we'd got rid of that truck! We may have a chance when the shooting starts. Then if we can pick off that Sergeant, the rest will be easy. Is anything easy? Richie, see that hill up there? I want you to take these men and take a look around. If there's anybody up there, we're sittin' ducks. We might as well sit down and be comfortable. - It looks like Bavaria. - Yeah, it does. I remember once when I was with the Brown Shirts I went up to Bavaria to arrest this old school teacher. He had his daughter with him. She would have knocked your eyes out. She was the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. Now don't tell us she let you get near her. Oh, you'd be surprised how nice she was to me. All I had to do was hint that I might save her father if she showed me the proper interest. You hated what she and her father stood for, but you were willing to make love to her. What has one got to do with the other? Anyway, I heard later they both died in a concentration camp. Waffen niederlegen! Haende hoch! Gebt euch auf! Wir sind Deutsche! Hoert ihr? Wir sind Kommandos! Nicht schiessen! Wir sind Kommandos! Cover 'em! Too bad he didn't know what a hotfoot was. I can't believe it! I just can't believe it! My bunk was next to his for six months! I shaved next to that guy! Boy, you guys sure don't look like the master race now. You look like someone hit you right in the face with a seltzer bottle! Grenade! Hit the dirt! On your feet! You won't need this anymore. I haven't got anything. For once, he's tellin' the truth. Let me see it. Let me see it! It's lucky for you, it's only a flesh wound. - Or unlucky. - Yeah, you're lucky all right! We could have killed you, just the way our guys got it outside the Stalag. - Why don't you shoot me now and get it over with? - Say the word, Sarge! Hold it. Here, take this. What are you waiting for? I know the rules of war. I'm gonna be shot as a spy anyway. That's what you want, isn't it. To die like a hero for the third Reich? It's not gonna be that easy. You'll stand trial just like any other spy. They're zeroing in. They must know we're coming. You must have radioed ahead. I'll tell you my name and serial number, that's all. I'm Lieutenant Hans Von Kroner serial number 16638 - and you can take me back to Battalion now. - They're too far behind now. Well, what are you gonna do with me? You're gonna come along with us. Well, what about the others who were with me? They died for Hitler. Go ahead. They'll be waitin' for us at that crossroads, Sarge. Yeah, I know. Well, we'll just have to take it anyway. They got plenty of heavy stuff up there, all right. They'll be pourin' it right down our throats. I should have gone home after we escaped. I've done my share. More than my share. Nobody can call old Virgil Ennis a shirker! Why didn't you go home? 'Cause you were stickin'. Doggone it, I'd have felt like the world's biggest coward if I'd gone off and left you here alone. I'll tell you what. If somebody has to watch our prisoner I'll give you that job. That ought to be safe enough. No, you don't. My luck's been all right so far. I'm gonna play it all the way out. Well that should about do it. Let's go. All right. This is it. Fielding, I want you to take your squad, two machine guns. I'm gonna base the fire here at the bottom of the hill. Over there. Now, I'll take the first and the second squad. We'll move in from the left through those trees. Now, at H hour or 08:00 our artillery will give us five minutes of preparation. Exactly five minutes. As soon as that fire lifts I want you boys and the machine guns to open up. Any questions? Okay, we got about 20 minutes before we take off. You brief your men. Here we go. Hey, Sarge, what do you want me to do with this joker? You better take him with the third squad. Make sure he's down out of the line of fire. What are you tryin' to prove? You're a prisoner of war. You're entitled to that much protection. Are you treating me this way because you're a German? No, because I'm a human being. I'm gonna tell you something you may not understand. I've got friends and relatives inside Germany. They're good and decent people. They didn't want this war. They didn't want to conquer the rest of the world. I got a feeling there must be millions just like 'em. Let's go, Virgil. Fire! All right, fire! All right, men, here we go! Let's go! You, Americans. It is no use to go on fighting! Put down your weapons or we will kill the rest of you. That's it. Dive in there! Dive in there! On your feet! Let's go, on your feet! Let me see that. Is it over? Yeah, it's over. There's nobody left but those prisoners. Help me up. - I'll get you med... - Help me up! Ich bin Hans von Kroner. Mein Vater ist General von Kroner. Hitlers Traum ist Wahnsinn! Wir haben die Arbeit des Teufels getan... Kameraden. Geht heim! Geht heim, wenn dieser Krieg zu Ende ist! Und schwoert nie wieder zu sagen: "Heil." - What'd he say, Sarge? - He said Hitler's dream was insane. He said they'd been doing the work of the devil. He said go home. Go home and swear never to say "Heil" again. Pinwheel, this is Pinwheel 3. Over. Pinwheel, this is Pinwheel 3. Mission accomplished. Crossroads is now secured. We have prisoners and a number of casualties. Await further orders.
