That's disgusting. Clears the bowels. Let me tell you something, it's not the man who points out how a strong man has stumbled. Or that the doer of deeds could have done better. The real credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. Whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood... who strives valiantly. And who if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly. - Who said that? - Theodor Roosevelt. He ate peanuts this way too. Wake up dummy. Shut up in there. Now go on get outta here and stay outta trouble. [sound of engine revving] [folksy funky bluesy rock music] Hey, Phil! Phil! What uh I don't know, yea, yea, yea I'll meet you down we'll go down. Woo!

That's bad, this place is gonna eat your lungs up. Gotta work, Bobby. Yea like my gramp's worked all his life and can't hardly breath no more. You need to quit smoking. [hard rock guitar riffs play] [sighs] The fork was all screwed up, put in a new clutch, a new chain and that chain was stretched. - Alright, what's the damage? - It's on the house. Alright thanks, you need any hubcaps? - They might. - No, not this time. You know Bobby you might think about getting yourself a real job. Yea, spending my life dying working in the mine ain't working for me, I can't do that anymore. Screw the mine. - Screw the mines - I hear that. Yea well hear this, my life might be short but it's gonna be anything but dull. [engine revving] [Phil] Yea, it's comin' around comin' around, give me that money. It's 2:1, that's $2 from you.

Bobby Knievel! Ah! Could maybe be a little bit of trouble. A little bit. That's fast. I was first. Am I supposed to be scared? Wow. Wow, where were the girls like you when I was in high school. - I don't know. - C'mon Linda. - Hey, you wanna ride? - I'll walk. You sure? In case you're wondering, my name's Bobby. I wasn't. We all know who robbed the jewelry store Mr. Bobby Knievel. Yea, well I wasn't talking to you, was I? - And you won't neither! - Charmaine. It's ok. Linda, he's a liar and a thief and God knows what else. Why don't you dump the body guard? I'm unarmed. - What'd you say? - You heard me. Charmaine, why don't you all run ahead and I'll catch up with you later. Fine, fine, c'mon girls. Don't believe the half of what they say about me. - What half is that? - God knows what half. So is it true, you robbed the jewelers? What Copper Heads? We got another one I don't know about? You gotta promise not to tell your friends. Well I don't make deals with convicts. Ouch, ok yea Copper Heads, heard it got robbed everybody thought I did it anyway so I went to a pawn shop bought a whole bunch of costume jewelry, sold it to people. They thought it came from Copper Heads. So you think you're clever do you? Yea. You got a last name, Linda? Bork. Well, hop on Linda Bork. I won't bite. Just make sure you keep both wheels on the ground. Two wheels on the ground, Bobby! [soft rock music] - Stop, stop, stop, stop. - What, what, what, what? I gotta get off here. What do you mean, you just got on. I know but my daddy is right there. Hey pop. Alright so um, see you around? - Count on it. - Alright. Hey daddy. Linda get back out here! I know you're looking out that window. Yes, sir. Ow! I hope you're getting a good look at that boy leaving... cause it's your last one. [old time upbeat rock and roll] [Bobby] Hey are you an actress or something? Who are you supposed to be, Paul Newman? No, no, no I'm Steve McQueen. Don't you know we're getting married tonight, Linda? - Oh you think so do you? - Oh I know so. Well let me tell you what I'm doing tonight Mr. Steve McQueen. - What's that? - I'm skating with Charmaine... and then I have to go home because I have to sort out my sock drawer. That's the wrong answer. You leave me no choice. What, Bobby! This is not funny, put me down! Charmaine! You all keep an eye on her, I'm calling the cops. - I'll scream I swear it. - Go ahead. - I mean it I'm gonna scream. - I'm gonna scream. [screaming] - Put me down. - Is that the best you can do? What did you think you're doing? I'm saving you. Do I look like I need saving? You look like an angel. [thunder clap] [Linda] Do you know where we're going? Anywhere but Butte, Montana. What's wrong with Butte? What's right with Butte? Hang on I gotta pull over, my eyeballs are floating. Hey you know everybody thinks you're crazy, you know that? I don't care what everybody thinks about me... except for you. What do you think? My jury's still out, I just got kidnapped. I'm sitting here telling you I love you and you're bringing up technicalities? Hey if you wanna go home I'll take you back, right now. No, I'm fine. [tender music] You're right, maybe we should go home. Why what's the matter? - You're a lousy kisser. - Bobby! That is not funny. [police siren] - Uh oh. - What's the matter? Bacon. Who? Oh my God. Hey, what? Knievel, don't you never learn? Daddy it's not what you think. Whoa, whoa. You don't know what I think. No, he didn't kidnap me though. I went with him cause I wanted to. Let's go. Daddy, I'm not leaving here without Bobby. Suit yourself. You love my daughter? Like a miner loves the sun. What? Yes, sir I swear it, I swear to God I love her. Don't mess with me me boy, ever! You hear me? Now you call the house tomorrow for a proper date... and I'll talk to Mrs. Bork. Can we go home now? You're not done, Knievel. Come here. [classic rock music] [kids arguing] - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Dad. Hi, it's the daredevils station wagon. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Daddy, can you take us for a ride? No, no I can't right now boys I'm working. Oh please Dad, please. - No, no go play on the bike. - Yes! - I get the red bike! - I get the black bike! - Don't knock 'em over. - Hi. - Hi. - Working hard? Hardly working. Anybody stop by today? Couple of people to challenge me in arm wrestling but this just isn't getting it done. You know you don't have to do this. Why don't you go back to selling life insurance? Those people nearly had a heart attack that time you nearly sold 150 policies that week. Oh yea you mean the 150 policies I sold to the nut jobs in the insane asylum? Yea. - Hey, Phil. - Hi. - Hey man. - Hey, Bobby. I gotta get back to work, Bobby. You get it right? Did you spell it right? - I don't know... maybe. - Get what right. Bobby, what are you up to? Bobby's up to nothing but Evel Knievel's got a plan that will blow their minds. This will make the Joey Chitwood daredevil show look like a flea circus. You when you kidnapped me and asked if I thought you were crazy? Changed my mind, I know you're crazy. That's alright, you like crazy. Kinda. [cat growling] C'mon baby. Oh yea, she is a big kitty. Ok, this here is the exit ramp so I kinda thought we'd tie her up here. Bobby, I don't think so. - Huh? - That ain't safe. No, no it's no sweat I'm gonna jump right over her man. It's very safe don't worry about it. I prefer if we're down on the other end on the entrance. Ok, Phil. Bring those snakes down here on this end. I'm not touching these things, Bobby, you come and get 'em. - You're not picking 'em up? - I am not doing that. Well pick up the snakes and bring 'em over here. - No, I'm not gonna do that. - You're not gonna what? Well I'm not bringing the snakes down there. - Yea, you are. - Oh no I'm not. I'm not picking 'em up. Then you gotta go to the ground. Well then you come and take me down to the ground. Yea, you bring your best c'mon. It's either down there or she's back on the truck. Not around the face. [upbeat swing time music] I will fight. [Phil] Now ladies and gentlemen. A dollar a piece. Would you be so kind as to support Evel Knievel Enterprises I would thoroughly appreciate it. Thank you people. Keep your seats the big jump is coming up here in a couple seconds. Thank you sir, thank you very much. That's a dollar a piece. Remember you are all part of American history. What you witness here today will never be done again and has never been done before. Find a place to sit and watch. [Phil] One dollar. [kid] What if daddy don't make it? Daddy will make it, Robby. You're just afraid the rattlesnakes will get ya. Hey, well those cougars are gonna bite your butt off. Robby, where'd you hear talk like that? Daddy says it all the time. - Shut up dunce. - Ok, boys. Enough. The snakes are real, they're very poisonous please stay away from the snakes. Now the big jump is coming up, can we have a round of applause for Evel Knievel please? Thank you very much. There has never been one like it, there will never be another one like it. Now you gotta remember when you get to the other end you gotta hit them brakes quick that's just gravel. - Yea, yea it's no problem. - Alright, it's no problem. - Evel Knievel style? - Evel Knievel style! - Let's do it. - Yea, let's do it. - Alright. - Alright hang on. What? Hang on. Alright, sit down. Fine? [upbeat old time rock music] Look there's dad. Woo ha! Let's go! Do it, do it, do it, do it! That's it, that's it, that's it. [crowd cheering] Wave to daddy. Yes! You remember that name folks, Evel Knievel. [tense rock music] Too short! [people exclaiming] Oh my! [people yelling] Snakes, snakes! Oh my God, Kelly watch your brother Robby, Robby don't leave your brother. Bobby, somebody help! Help! Now this, I bet you people would pay to see this! Ah, Bobby! [drum roll] [patriotic music] Hello there, my name is Evel Knievel and I am a professional daredevil. What you're about to see is a compilation, some highlights and some low lights from my very own spectacle. Evel Knievel's daredevil show. I hope you enjoy it and come on out the next time we're in the neighborhood. Thank you very much for your time and God bless America. [man] Yea, well you tell him what I said. What's this jackpots name again? Knievel, Evel Knievel. I'll call you back. We've been getting calls all week about him. Life, Wide World of Sports, Sports Illustrated... each one sent a different piece of film. He's got this daredevil show and he crosses the country jumping for some pretty big crowds. And he wants to jump my fountains? That's right. Must be a city block from end to end. He got a death wish? How's this for a death wish? Oh! Oh. He claims he's gonna jump the Grand Canyon. Could be a nice draw DJ, inspire the suckers to take a few chances at the tables. [woman paging] Mr. Sarnote, I have Mike Rosenstein from Evel Knievel Enterprises on the line. Yea? [thick accent speaking on phone] Sarnote, please sit down. He's here but everybody wants a piece of him ok? Everybody. I'll do you a favor and I'll tell him to stop by. That's ok, I'll tell you I'll call you after you've met the kid and we'll talk, ok? That was the worst accent I've ever heard. It was bad but I think it worked, I'm going up. You... you're not gonna go up there like that are you? What's wrong with the way I look? Oh we're gonna buy you some new clothes. What... what's wrong with these clothes? These clothes look just fine. Hey, kid! Where you been? - We've been looking for ya. - Have ya now? Well I'm sorry I've been real busy. Can I get you something to drink Mr. Knievel? Wild Turkey on the rocks? I hear you wanna jump over my fountains... on a "motorcicle". - The jumps only part of it. - Yea? Which part? Well the best part. See the jumps like your orgasm, then you got your foreplay and your after-play. It's all part of the whole Evel Knievel experience. Orgasm? Well the jump only lasts a couple of seconds so I gotta build 'em up. Come out, make an entrance, wave to the crowd. Give a speech about the importance of keeping your word, warn all the young kids about the hazards of my profession. Then I'll say something like I'm not sure if I'll make it or not, thanks, then rock and roll. Go on. So at the same time I'm telling them how exciting and dangerous what I'm about to do is, I tell the mommas "don't let your babies grow up to be Evel". I... I don't get it. Well that gets the women on my side. See what I'm saying is I'm both good and bad. Isn't that the way that all women like their men? All this talk, is it necessary? Well yes it's necessary, Jay. Listen, I'm an expert on this man. Women and kids love to come see me talk and men, well men love to come see me crash. Don't play me for a sucker, boy. That's something I'm an expert on. Well then we got us two experts Mr. Sarnote. I think we'll be alright. You won't be disappointed, I promise you. - Ok, I'm still on the ramp. - Alright. I told you that things been running hot. Ray, can you help Phil pull this head out? That's a long way across Mr. Knievel. Further than the Wright brothers flew the Spirit of Saint Luis Heard you wanted Wild World of Sports to cover it. You know my name... let's hear yours. John Derrick. That actor? And director. Ok, I'm ready. Look, you're the start of my next film. Hey sweetheart. You need some help with that? I don't know, do I? Well I'll tell you what, why don't you set it down right there and I'll get it. Maybe we'll share a beer later. Well sure. Can my... husband come too? - What? - Yea, say hi to my wife... Linda Evans. She's an actress, she's destined for great things. Is that right? And she's my camera operator. Well are you great with the camera too, or is that just dressing on the wound? If you can jump it, I can shoot it. You just try to keep me in the picture, honey. You Hey uh, you guys know John Wayne? Yea. Tell him I said he's a wuss.

Mrs. Knievel would like to speak with you. [woman] Yes, alright I will have him... The doctor will be right with you. [man] Thank you very much. Thank you. It wasn't so hard now was it? Bobby's suffered massive trauma, his pelvis was crushed, his femur was pushed up through his pelvis and we have steel rods in there holding it all together. He's also fractured half his ribs and he's broken his right arm and his right hand. And he has internal injuries to his spleen and his kidney, and I haven't even touched on the contusions and lacerations and abrasions. No, there's no good way to say this, he's suffered a severe brain concussion and he's in a coma. Now if he comes out of it... we don't think he's gonna walk again. But if he does walk... he's never ever gonna ride a bike again. I'm here, Bobby. I'm here. So the kids are doing well. Robby's taking it pretty hard though, he clams up, he wants to be a hard man like his dad. Kelly keeps asking me questions. I keep saying you know daddy's gonna be... I'm just gonna check on him. Oh, hey Trish. You know I talk to him because it makes me feel better, I don't... I don't actually think he can hear me or anything. You never know. No, you never do. [soft disconcerting music] Well hey. Linda. Hey, hey... hey. Hey... hey. Come here. You don't look too happy to see me. I thought you'd... Oh that's alright, oh it's alright. I'm still here, I'm still here. I thought I'd lost you. Hey. Nothing can kill me you know that. I'm Evel Knievel. Yea. How long was I out? Twenty-nine days. Twenty-nine days. You never gave up on me? You never let go? I never let go. Alright now before we show you Evel's spectacular leap over the fountains at Caesar's Palace, let me warn you. This raw footage is pretty shocking However it's good to know the daredevil himself survived. He's set to leave the hospital tomorrow morning. Alright, here it is. Evel Knievel. Oh. Shut it off. I said shut it off! C'mon, turn it off. That's it show's over. That's it, daddy's gotta get some rest. C'mon Ok. Alright. We'll get it later. Linda, get Trish in here I'm in pain! In here, what kind of hospital is this! God. Yes, Mr. Knievel. Trish, I'm in pain dammit. I need my morphine. Put a sock in it, Bobby I'm coming. I'm gonna be the one passing out socks, I'm gonna come in there in a minute. Bye Linda. Bye Bobby. Bye, thanks you. Mr. Knievel, Mr. Knievel. Mind giving me an autograph? I'm sorry, I don't have any paper. Paper? Who needs paper, come here darlin'. Can I give him a kiss Mrs. Knievel? Have at it honey, everybody else does. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm/ Bye. [woman] Bye, Evel. [woman] There he is! What the hell is that? I have no idea. Crowd cheering. Evel. [man] Evel. Evel, Evel. Was that your last jump? Are ya done? Done? Aw here it goes. Does it look like I'm done? There's a rumor that you're thinking of jumping the Grand Canyon. It's not a rumor it's a fact. Evel, come on you know how far it is across the Grand Canyon. Well I saw it in a poster in a bar once. I thought this canyon's too big for jumping but you know the more I drank the littler it got. [people laughing] [parade marching band music] Hi, Bobby. [woman] Can I have a hug? Hey. See that card over there? Keep the nails, Bobby! Beat the man! [sweet rock guitar riff plays] So uh, where's the name Evel come from? Well Steve McQueen challenged me to a race awhile back and I think he thought he was pretty hot stuff with a motorcycle, yea? Well I showed him what hot stuff is. Anyway, after it was over he said man... Pure evil. So what is it, he got a death wish? I think probably more than that he's got a money wish. Oh everybody's gonna die. Nobody gets out of this world alive, ain't that right Phil? That's right, nobody. - Nobody - Nobody, sir. And if anybody does you're gonna let me know about it, right? - You got that right. - So what you're saying then is pretty much anyone can do it, right? All you gotta do is grab the handle bars and fly. You think it's easy to stare death in the face? I tell you what big boy, you try it! Try it. [bluesy rock music] So what do you say to people who accuse you of pandering. I think of General Patton when he said, "it's not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, the credit belongs to the man in the arena". "Who if he fails, fails while daring greatly." Yes! You see that's the difference between the little man and the great man, we get knocked down but we don't get knocked up. I thought Bobby was a hellion, I chased him all over this damn town. I uh I thought it was Teddy Roosevelt who said that. Oh yea that's right it was, he heard it from General Patton. I tell ya I ain't ever seen anything like that boy. Not before and not since. Whoa, no, no! Nice drive! Is it? It's no where close to the flag. It's a par 4, you're not expected to reach the flag on your first shot. Right. You ever played before? Nah I've played hockey, it's just like hotting a slap shot. Well you know there are some things about this game I think I'm gonna like. Well you stroked a nice ball, son, right in the middle of the fairway. Yea and I hadn't even had my first beer yet. You going back on the road, Bob? It's kinda hard not to with all the money they're throwing at me. I always wondered something, John. Why'd you let Linda and I have the green light? Wouldn't have done any good not to. The thing about Linda is she always took in strays. Rabbits, cats, dogs, birds, whatever. She'd hide 'em under the bed, in the closet... the girls got a soft heart. But a hard head. Well I noticed. That and you got grit... I like grit. [soft laid back music] Well what do you think? It, it's so big. I love it. Yea, me too c'mon. C'mon I'll give you the tour. Ta-da. What. What don't you like? No, I like it. But what? Bobby, this just costs way too much money. C'mon sweetheart we're rolling in it. I know but I don't... I don't really wanna spend it here without you and the kid don't want you gone all the time. I'm going back out on the road, we already discussed this. Wait a minute, we never discussed this! What do you want me to stay home? Get a regular job selling used cars or tires or something? Well forget it! I'm the guy who jumps bikes, that's what I do. You know you get all the attention in the world it'll never be enough. Oh c'mon cut the crap. I do what makes me happy! Those fans need me just as much as I need them. You think that they actually give a damn about what happens to you? Do you really think that those people would lay by your bedside for 29 days while you're dead to the world? You know what, if you don't want the house... I was there! I didn't leave you! Look, you want love... you got all the love you need right here. All the love in the world. I love you, Bobby. I love you so much and I see you hurting all the time. And it's breaking my heart. Maybe you didn't hear me, I said I jump bikes Linda. That's what I do You go and do whatever it is you gotta do. [disconcerting music] I like this project people, let's have all the final paperwork on my desk by the end of business today. Alright? Good. Well so nice of you to join us, Pryer. What the hell happened to you? Looks like you had a run in with Cassius Clay. I didn't believe it but... Cow Palace was packed, sold out and at least half of them were kids. Evel rides in in this red, white and blue getup to address the crowd. I'm down in front next to a bunch of bikers that have been drinking and uh heckling... Now I'm thinking it's probably not a good place for a brother to be. Now Evel ignores them but after awhile he starts laying into them. Called them scum and told them to get lost. Why don't you get on with your show pretty boy. - Why don't you shut your mouth! - You shut your mouth... As he was headed for this jump I see this biker dude throw this tire iron... Now he's gone. Man, jerks. Now that is when I should have gotten out of there. That's right, c'mon Buddy. Evel comes back around and jumps on the biker that threw the tire iron. The bikers pile on him, they were gonna kill him! [man] C'mon! And that's when it happened. Evel's fans, nice everyday people beat the crap outta those bikers! I'm talking mothers, grandmothers swatting these big guys with their purses, anything they could get their hands on. Anything. Evel... is more than just a folk hero. And this... is what Ideal Toys should make. What's the research like, Bryan? He is the most recognized man in America, men admire him, women wanna sleep with him. And kids wanna be like him. Well ladies and gentlemen... GI Joe and Barbie better start running we're gonna jump on Evel Knievel. This trailer cost $91,000, it has wall to wall carpeting and everything a man could possibly want including a fully stocked bar with hot and cold running Olympia Beer on tap. Now, when the Ideal Toy company came to me and they said they want to make an Evel Knievel doll, action figure whatever you call it. They said, Evel what would you like it to be like? And I said, make it indestructible. [men] Yea. That's right. Young lady what's your name? Lily. Lily, you wanna come up on stage for me? Let's hear it for Lily everybody. [crowd] Alright. Woo. Here you go, thank you Lily. Make it indestructible, make it so tough that a tractor could run over it, a nuclear bomb could explode on top of it and it would go on and on and on. Just like this great nation of ours. You could not destroy this Evel Knievel action figure... just as you could not destroy the United States of America. That's right. Now between you and me we're selling out pretty fast so... get while the gettin's good and God bless America. Thank you for coming out today folks. [patriot music plays] What, what, what?

Toby, another round of Olympia and Montana mule for my long lost son in law. You taking the boys fishing this weekend? If it's alright with you. Hell no it's not alright with me that's why I came down here. I'm not invited? Maybe as long as we don't have to cram that damn motorcycle of yours in the raft. No, no, no, no sir Awful. If you play that ridiculous crap again I'm gonna come down there and whoop your ass. Damn, my finger must have slipped. I was gonna play George Hamilton's favorite song, "Viva Las Vegas". - Philip. - Good to see you man. - Bob! - Yea. You set a date for the Grand Canyon yet? Here Mr. Bork. Hey there Mr. Bobby Knievel. Oh my God, Charmaine. He cleans up real good don't he Mr. Bork? You still robbin' banks Bobby? You still busting balls, Charmaine? Every chance I get. Cheers. Cheers. No, I can't make a deal on the Grand Canyon the government's chicken. I am gonna jump a canyon I just gotta find the right one. I was kinda hoping you'd stick around son, I got nobody to trade lies with anymore. - Hey Bobby. - Yea. You thought about Snake River down by Twin Falls? In Idaho? Yea, it's real pretty my ex has got a place down there. - Really? - Mhm. Good, I'll keep it in mind. You know, Bob... it's gonna... be a little tricky for you to pull all this off. I suppose. No, I'm not talking about the Grand Canyon or the Snake River son, I'm talking about you staying alive long enough to spend your money.

[grandpa] Ok, now you feel that current boys? Pulling us along. [Evel] Haha, here we go. No TV, no phones... There's good water up ahead, you see that right up there? [grandpa] You know boys this river was sacred to the Indians. Lewis and Clark came through here. Who are they? They were the first white men to come through these parts. That was the second white man to come through. Oh yea, here we go this is better than fishing, right guys? [boy] C'mon stay back. [gramps] C'mon. Bob, I think we better get to shore! No, we're alright. You guys holding on back there? Yea, we're ok we're fine past this part. [gramps] Crow. [Evel] C'mon guys. Bob, get it away from those damn rocks! [Evel] We'll be alright, we'll be alright. - Yow! - Watch out for that rock! Dad! Bob! [boy] Help! Help, Dad! Hey. I swear. Help! - Hey. - Grandpa! Robby! Help. I got you son, I got you. Dad, help! Hang onto me. Grandpa. Go around! - Right there. - Grandpa. - Hold on. - Grandpa! No! Grandpa! Grandpa! Jay! - Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Jack! - Grandpa! Jay! [tense music] [boy] Grandpa hang on! Jay! Help me. Help me! Jay! Lord we pray for a safe journey for your child, John Bork. As you welcome him back into your kingdom. We ask this in the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost. Amen. [crowd] Amen. [somber music] I just couldn't get to him. It was an accident, nobody blames you for what happened. When we first met I hated his guts. But now I know he was more like a father to me. God, I'm gonna miss him. This tour, I'm postponing this tour. - No. - Yea. No, you can't. You can't do that not like this. You need to go. Jump over the moon, Bobby. We'll all come see you. K? Come on listen we gotta get this moving, everything has to be out of the way. Now guys listen, this is gonna fire. Ok, folks gather around we're about ready to get started. Come on in here and get where you can see, we'll get this show on the road. Thanks for coming out today. Now ladies and gentlemen what you're about to witness is a testament to the genius of my engineer NASA man, Bob Truax! [rock music] Now we'll get this show on the road. I give you... the X2 Sky-sight. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on. [tense music] Come on boys let's go, c'mon. Everybody alright? Everything's ok, we just got some kinks to work out. That's right it's a prototype. It's too late for the Bob we're not... cause you can't postpone this. These things happen, these guys are getting rich off me. Yes you Bob, you're getting rich off me. Fine. I'll write you a check. Well that's all you're gonna get, a check. Just... alright... just um, Bob. Fine, fine, fine. Jeez. This son of a bitch jump's gonna be my ruin. I mean the money is going out as fast as it's coming in. Why don't you get somebody else to pay for it? Ok, um who? What about them? ABC's wide world of sports? Yea, they televise all kinds of crazy stuff. I'd like to present this check for $6,000,000 in preparation for the great Snake River Canyon jump. Here you go, Evel. Ooh. Now Top Ranked will be broadcasting this world shaking event at closed circuit locations nationwide on September the 8th. We've taken to calling it the Evel Knievel says goodbye tour. Evel, does goodbye mean you don't believe you can make it across? No, no, no that's not what it means. It means that after this jump I'll be saying goodbye to you all. I'm taking my $6,000,000 and riding off into the sunset. Well let me put this down for you. How you plan on spending it, Evel? I'm blowing every penny. Why don't we have Evel take you step by step through this jump. Sure no problem Bob, thanks. Now my NASA engineer, Bob Truax has achieved nothing short of perfection with the X2 Sky-sight. I'll be accelerating from 0 - 200 in 2.5 seconds. By the time I reach that launch pad I'll be going 394 miles per hour. Chances are I'll black out, that's what 5G's will do to you. Fifteen seconds later I will reach my apex of 300 feet where I will slow to 200 miles per hour... Now it's at that point that a parachute will deploy and I will more than likely red out. That is I will lose blood from my eyes, nose, ears and mouth as it rushes back into my head. Now the last minute I will be descending slower and slower until I touch down nose first, climb out... and flip the bird to you all who said it couldn't be done, you know who you are. We hear your prototypes have all failed. That's cause I wasn't in 'em. It's gonna be a lot different when Evel Knievel's the pilot. What do you think of the so called "Knievel Phenomenon" kids are actually getting hurt trying to duplicate your stunts. Well as far as I'm concerned I'm a great roll model... You know if I was a parent I would want my kids taking chances; living in the sunlight, not hiding or cowering from life. That's no way to live. Yea, even if it means the kids paralyzed for life? Hey who let Gloomy Guss in here? Was that you Bob? - It wasn't me. - Security. Ok, thank you that's it. Now let's give Evel a hand here. Party at the Snake River. [funky 70's music] Three streets, yea? Let's go have some drinks. Woo! Ladies, ladies, ladies. Wahoo. Are those diamonds real? Are those real? Why don't you find out. You know this cane was given to me by Mohamed Ali. He said I may be the greatest but Evel Knievel is the farthest outest. He is the white Mohamed Ali. And I said no, no you're wrong you my friend you are the black Evel Knievel. Ow! Hoo, hoo, hoo! [door slamming] Hey. Hey. Where are the kids? At school. Oh... yea... that's right. You want something? No. No, I'm good with juice. You have something you wanna say. Nope. You sure? I'm your wife, Bobby, not your jailor. Then I guess you don't care if I take the kids to Toronto this weekend? Since when have you ever given a damn about my opinion on anything you do? You know what? I think it's a great idea, I think it's great. Go ahead, go ahead. It'll give them something to remember you by. Oh and Bobby. Hmm? Don't you dare whore around in front of those boys, ok? Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen you all know about the big party coming up at the Snake River, right? Now I'd love for you all to join me but if you can't please... watch it on closed circuit television. You will not want to miss it, I promise you. It is with great pride and extreme pleasure that I introduce my sons to you here tonight. Kelly, where are you boy? Come on out. Kelly Knievel. Robby, come on out and show 'em what you got. Alright. Ha-ha! Good job son. Ok... the Knievel's! Stayed, they're fast, good job, Robby. Good job boys. Ok, you hang onto your seat, I'll hang onto these handle bars and see if we can get this bike over these cars. What do you say? [crowd cheering] Cool. I told you already the equipment has to be outta here before we do this. I told you already, now get it out! Come on talk to me here, Bob, what's going on now? You're gonna see a vast improvement this time. - Yea, well I better. - You will. [tense music] Man, that's great! Maybe I'll just do figure eights all the way across the canyon, Bob. The last one's yours. Hey! Watch your mouth, Bob! Watch your mouth. You have a significant cash flow problem. Yea, what else is new? You're getting calls from the IRS. The government says that you owe a tremendous... I owe, I owe, I owe that's all I hear outta you four eyes. I'm tired of this crap. Slide over. I said slide over. Didn't know he knew how to fly. Oh he don't but he's getting better. You're getting better, you're getting better, Bobby? Uh not really. He's flying this plane without a license? Yup. He can do that? His plane. You might wanna buckle up there yule burner. How'd it go today? I don't know. Tell me anyway. I'm a goner. Don't jump, Bobby. It's not that easy babe. It's not something I can just decide not to do. Why? Cause I gave my word, that's why. You do something long enough like it or not. It becomes who you are. Even if it means never seeing this little girl again? And our two beautiful boys in the other room? None of the test jumps even worked. Call the damn thing off. If I quit now it'll just kill me slower you know that. It's just pride, Bobby. That's all that is. Some days I don't understand you at all. But I do know that you're gonna do what you have to do. That's right. All or nothing now. Came from nothing, never had nothing. All sounds pretty good to me. Just come back to us, ok? Just come back. Ok, come on. Get in. Come on. Where's he going? Hmm, I don't know he went to get another jacket or something. He has got a jacket on! Well I don't know, he wants to wear two jackets we're late as it is. - That is just, you know what... - Please. You know what, honestly. I don't know, you know the boy. [Linda arguing] [Evel] Well maybe he wants heavy jacket. [Linda] He's already acting just like you.

Everybody listen up here, Wrench. Pipe down please. Ladies and gentlemen I know you're all excited to be here today. I know you've been waiting anxious for this moment. You all action packed to see this Evel Knievel, he's gonna take that rocket and he's gonna jump over that canyon. Alright! You man enough to do this? Are you man enough to make this jump? [tense music] [crowd] Evel! Evel! Evel! Are you man enough to walk away? [crowd] Evel! Evel! Evel! Ladies and gentlemen, Evel Knievel! [man] Evel what are you thoughts... Let's go up four, take four. When I crashed at Caesar's the doctors said I was gonna die. When I didn't die they said I'd never walk again. When I walked again they said I'd never jump again, well I'm jumping again. Hey Evel! People are saying that all you're serving up the American public is some high octane crap. You shut up, you shut your mouth. I'm about to jump a canyon, let's see you do it or sit your fat ass down. Yea. And next time you see me, Mr. Bob Wolf, put a smile on your face. I don't smile for anyone. That's totally gonzo. Get him out! Get him out! I don't have to take stuff like this! I need my camera. I'll take that camera and shove it in your ear. [crowd heckling journalist] Get him out! Go on! Go two. You'll do one thing... I don't ask for your respect I demand it. I wish I didn't have to do this, but I'm gonna do it. Cause I'm Evel Knievel. Crap. I'm the last gladiator in the new Rome and that's it. Lord we humbly pray that you will that you will watch over Evel. Protect him in flight... and guide him to a safe landing. Whether it be on Earth or in heaven. Amen. Thank you, father. [crowd cheering] [tense music] Alright, it's one minute and counting. One minute to go here. One minute to go before Evel attempts to a 1500 foot jump across the Snake River Canyon, something that's never been tried before. Bob. Bob! Evel! Remember, launch with the button on your left hand and don't forget, pull the lever with your right for the parachute. Good luck. [broadcaster] Ok, can everybody in the booth be silent right now. This is the time when he sells himself on the idea that he can do this. Jim, all I can tell you is happy landing to Evel Knievel. I've never seen anything like this. God... here I come... ready or not. Alright, here he goes. He's got it, that's it Evel. Stay with that bird. Camera two, cut it tighter, tighter. [broadcaster] He's going, he's going up, wait there's some kind, there's some kind of problem here. There's some kind of a mistake. It looks like the parachute has deployed. It looks like he's going into the river. Jim, I don't know if it was deliberate or a malfunction. The ships going down, it looks like he's going down into the river. That's it now, there he is he's below the roof of the canyon. He's gonna, he's gonna crash. If he goes into the water he'll drown for sure. They've got safety divers down there but I don't know if they can get to him on time. [diver] There! Half way! I think he's going into the water. [crowd exclaiming] [tense music] Robert Craig Knievel did not clear the Snake River Canyon, the 1500 foot jump that he has worked so hard to make. We think he may be dead or drowning. Get those boats ready to go! [ominous music] [broadcaster] What's that? It appears that he has landed, he's on the bank. He's landed on the bank. Bobby! Bobby, Jimmy, we're over here! [crowd booing] You suck! [broadcaster] And it looks like he's alright Robert Craig Knievel did not drown and they're bringing him back up from the boat to the helicopter here. Man, that's great news. I tell you, you don't see this kind of crazy stuff on a heavy weight fight. People are getting the greatest show on Earth here. [crowd booing] [woman] Evel. Evel, what happened out there? I don't know what happened, I don't know what happened. I tried to steer it, if I went in the river it would have been over I would have never gotten out ever! It looked like you were having problems with the 'chute was... Evel, Evel are you planning on apologizing... No, I'm never apologizing to that fat ass and if he comes back here I'll throw him out again and he can kiss my ass. You know what? You can kiss my ass too, you can all kiss my ass. [man] You suck man! Well there you have it. Pucker up gentlemen, we're all gonna be kissing Evel's ass. [TV] And here he is, the man of the hour, Richard Petty. Back in victory lane here at Daytona. What a great day for this team. This STP team they were flawless all day. I think the key for the victory here for the Petty Enterprise team was this move right here. Let's go back about 10 laps to go, the move that Richard Petty made right here on Benny Parsons for the victory. This was the key all day long... What? So you're just, you're just gonna sit there? [TV] Richard Petty again the victor... Wait, Linda, Linda don't. For how long? How long what? Are you just gonna sit there? Did you see what they're writing about me? The great rip off. The anti climax of the decade. Did Evel pull the 'chute? Did I pull the 'chute! They think I pulled the 'chute! It deployed and they think I pulled it. Since when have you been a quitter? Oh I'm not a quitter but they're calling me a fake and liar and that pisses me off. You know what a lot of guys, a lot of guys said they could jump that Snake River but I didn't see a line of them behind me. So what happened to the man who refused to lay down and die, the man who always gets back up on his feet? I don't know, I don't know, he's gone. So... That's it. So what, you just gonna sit around here and feel sorry for yourself? Damn you, Bobby! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What am I supposed to do? Huh? Now what do you want me to do? You don't like what those people are saying about Snake River, then get the hell off of your ass and go defend yourself! You want your fans back? Then get the hell up and go get them I wanna change the number of buses. Thirteen's an unlucky number. I'll tell the boys it's gonna be 12. Hey, Jimmy! No, no, no, no you uh... better make it 14. You ain't cleared 13 buses. Yea, I'm aware of that. - Yea. - Phil. Yea? But this is the first time the American public has seen me since Snake River, it's gotta me good so it's gonna be 14 or nothing. You ain't gonna clear 14. - Well thanks a lot pal. - Sorry. Sorry my ass! You know if this conversation doesn't take a turn in a hurry I'll drive that 14th bus out there myself! I'll set up right underneath the ramp! Alright, Bobby! Concessions do a lot better when you make your jump. Did we come here to sell nachos or open a can of whoop ass? You.. man you're full of it. Look at you... Fourteen it is.

I didn't quit, I always tried to get up and America needed that worse than anything in the world. And I've had 10 steel plates set in me... I've got bionic arms... that's what Lindsey Wagner the bionic woman told me. I used to date her. I'm a mess. I live for 4 things, riding motorcycles, driving trucks, chasing broads and man there are plenty of broads. If a guy's married and has a little sex with another woman he could compare her to his wife and I've done that for 14 years and I've got the same wife. I mean she's pretty good. There's no king, no president, no prince that's lived a better life than me. I've done everything I ever wanted to do. [patriotic music] Ah... except kill somebody. [Robby] What if daddy don't make it? [Kelly] You're just afraid will get ya. [Robby] Hey well those cougars are gonna bite your butt off. [Linda] Where'd you hear talk like that? [Kelly] Daddy says it all the time. [Robby] Shut up, dummy!
