Quite sure that is your ticket? Oh God,lights gone out You blow out that light Me I have done everything,don't I?

We might But from what I heard about Sheldrake it won't be too easy Bah! His reputation is probably grossly exaggerated That remains to be seen He may be dead That body you know Takes quite a lot to kill old Sheldrake I believe Look As you were saying it takes a lot to kill me Are you Sheldrake? You both have a train? And the girl, too. Who is that with the Ackroyd girl? We found him nosing around when we came in There is another locked in the bathroom, he's probably asleep by now We can't bother about them now We'd better getting down I do hear, haven't we better.. I don't know what one does in these cases But these two? Haven't we better tie them up or something? Is it necessary? Unless you want them to run down stairs to call for the police I hope you don't mind we got to catch train Ah,don't be damned silly Come on please Sorry we have to go on this journey but we must leave someone about in the house,you know I see So many thieves about,eh?
