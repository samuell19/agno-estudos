You weren't even made to wait at the door.. ..and he says that the household people know him. l?ll show you just now that they know me. How will they not recognize me? l?m the one who arranged this house for them. What can l do if they have expired? But how can they expire just like that?

And in that l told her very clearly, that if.. ..you don?t like my Goddess like and mother like.. ..landlady, then even l have no need of such a wife. l?ll live my whole life, alone in this room. Didn't l say what was right, mother? No, please tell me. No, you hit me with slippers, but tell me. Yes, yes, you said the right thing. Very good. l?m saved. ? Listen, give me her address. l?ll bring here by the ear and straighten her up. How will she come here just like that? What live said, that l've said. Hey, even though she has insulted you so much.. l'll straighten her, isn't it? l?m trapped, l thought that the story would be done with. And here, she?s thinking of bringing here herself. What did you say? No, where did l say anything? What l was saying was.. ..that is this month of mourning, isn't it? So, as soon as this month passes.. ..l?ll bring her myself and offer her at your feet. l think this is all the thing of the stars. l've an idea. it's grahan day after tomorrow. - Yes. You beg alms from five houses. Everything will be all right. l?m dead. l?m dead. Give me alms, drive away the eclipse! Where do these hermits come in the early mornings? Why doesn't the police arrest them and take them away? Here, go, and don't shout. l've a head ache. l haven?t had my hang over her. Hey, give me alms and drive away the eclipse! Hey, go away, don?t stick your eclipse to us, go! Sampat! Hey, how did these hermits come to know of my name? l?m very famous. Everyone must be knowing my name. Who is it brother? - Hey, Sampu, Sampu? He?s dropping the level and speaking. Who is it? Ravi. Have you started to beg in the part time? Sampat, everyone who accepts you as his teacher.. ..he will start begging for alms! What do you mean? l mean that, you lied, and l?m the one who?s reaping it. You, Sampat thief! ? Tell me what it is properly. Why are you just beating around the bush? What should l tell you? That day, while taking the house from the land lady.. ..you had lied to her, that my wife is your brother?s daughter, Now she goes to go and bring the wife. From where should l bring her? l've an idea now. Bring that girl from.. ..any where and present her as my wife to her. l should bring a girl for you? Do l look like a pimp to you? ? if you don?t act like.. ..a pimp, then l?ll be slaughtering you. Give me some idea immediately! Yes l?ll give you an idea. Let me think about it a little bit. Yes, l got it. ? Yes? ? it?s such an idea.. ..l feel like kissing my cheeks with my own lips. That?s enough. Tell me further. Yes, it?s an excellent idea. You go and tell the Landlady.. ..that ëLandlady, my wife has expired.? All these are old, childhood ideas. When l used to bunk school, then l.. ..would go the next day and give these.. ..ideas as excuses to the teacher. -fine. Before the death of my father, l'd killed him twenty times. Hearing about the death of the wife.. ..the landlady will be quiet, and it will be this.. ..troublesome matter?s the end for ever! Give me alms, let the eclipse be driven away. May you remain happy, forever! You? Since when did you start this business? No. l gave this idea to someone. And he gave me this sack as fees.. if you continue giving your rotten ideas to people.. ..this will be your state. One day.. ..you?ll be hanging this sack by your neck.. ..and begging for alms at every road. So what? That?s the state of the whole country. The whole country is moving around with sack. First they used to tell, do something good.. ..and drown it in the river, now they tell.. ..to give an idea and take care of the bundle. Who is it? l?ll be right back. l?m very happy. What happened? Don't know why!? Why is my heart beating so? Who has come, on the roads of love? Why is my heart beating so, today? Hey, hey! This seems like a ghost. What is this? Does a husband bless.. ..his wife with a single finger? Hey, this ghost speaks too! Who are you? You stayed away from me for a.. .. few days and you even forgot my face? ? Face? Does a husband speak like this to his wife? ? Husband, wife? Just to listen to hear two words love from you.. ..l came here secretly, without telling anyone anything. Just like Rekha had come to Amitabh for his love. Amitabh, Rekha! ? Now, l've come to you. All the distances are covered. Now it?s just you, and me. Me, and you. There is no third person between us. Now, the both of us will roam around together. We?ll talk about love, it?ll be great fun, and it?ll be great fun! But first, let me have a look at my house. Wow, We've got such a huge house. it's such a huge hall. it?s so airy. There is no need of any fan here. You have made my photo and kept too? -but madam.. From this, one comes to know how much you love me. if anyone should have a husband.. ..he should exactly be like you. You look so sweet. But, but please listen to me, Miss. Not a miss, but kiss. The whole program has been ruined. Sampat, where have you trapped me now? l've come from so far, and you haven't.. ..even asked me whether l?ll have tea or coffee. You don?t even know how to look after your wife. it's doesn't matter. l'll prepare it myself. O, l had just brought the girl?s photo. O God! You sent me a real and live girl. O Ma?am, what are you doing in the kitchen? You have already prepared all the food and kept. How did you know that l?m coming? Oh yes, your heart must have told you. isn't it? Do you know whose house this is? ? No, l don?t. Then, are you swatting flies here. Get lost from here. Wow, what excellent food has been cooked! See, now l?m getting angry now. l?m getting angry now. You get lost from here.. ..or else l will throw you out from here. Wow, l?m enjoying it so much. in one film, Kamal Hassan had held.. ..Sridevi's hand exactly like this. See, see. l?m telling you the last time. You go away from here silently.. ..or else, l?ll hold your pig tail, and drag you.. ..and throw you out on the road in the dust bin, yes. Hey, you?re scolding me like a villain. Why will l go out from here? This is my house. No, this is not your house. it?s your father?s house. Get lost. it?s my husband?s house. ? Get lost from here. Get lost.. What has happened to your neck? ls it a rash due to the heat? Ravi? You were saying that she won't be coming? She has come. ? Yes, she has come. Hey, the land lady that you had written about in the letter.. ..she?s the one, isn't it? ? Yes? Yes, yes. l?m the one. Mother! Please bless me. May God bless your marriage! May he fill your womb quickly! See, mother, since l've come here, he's scolding me. Why, Ravi, why are you scolding her? l?ll tell you. Listen to me first. She?s a very troublesome.. Mother, listen to me first. The both of us had decided.. ..that when we will have our own house.. ..then we?ll celebrate our honeymoon there. He went and told my father that he can't keep.. ..me with him for six months. Because he doesn't have time. When l couldn't stand it any longer.. ..l took the permission if my father and came here myself. Now, you tell me, What wrong did l do? What is my fault? Mother, she?s lying. You don?t know who she is. l?ll tell you.. ? l know everything. She?s your wife, what else? And how can the car of life work without a wife? That?s perfectly right. The husband and wife.. ..are the two wheels of the car of life. if one wheel doesn't exist, then the car of life can never work. Anyway, l?ll explain all these things to you later. You've from a long journey. You wash up and rest, okay? l?ll meet you later again. See, don?t trouble her again, okay? You forgot the matter of the letter. ? What l've said. Oh God, where have l been trapped! Listen, where is the bath room? - There. Bathroom? You want a bathroom? At the crossroads, there is a barber?s shop. Next to it is a public bath. You get water in one rupee. Go, and have a bath there. Go, go there. Why should l go there? This house is mine. The bathroom and water of this house is mine too. He?s come to send me there. Hey, where are you going there, get lost from here. l?m going to the bathroom, to have a bath. And listen, by the time l come back from my bath.. ..put some more salt in the food and keep it ready. You have made it completely plain. You! You daughter of an owl! O God! What is this problem? Why did.. ..such a Phoolan Devi had come to my house? Please take her away from here, please. Hey, what are you doing outside? l?m crying over my fate, come out. Cry over your fate later, first do one thing. in my bag, there is a red colored sari.. ..and it?s matching blouse. Please give it to me. You wretch, am l your servant? Am l your slave? Come out, or else l?ll drink your blood. Yes. it?s a blood red colored sari. When you had come to see me for the first time.. ..l'd worn that sari. Please give it to me. Are you coming your silently or not? My blood is boiling because of my anger. You come out, or else l?ll throw you naked out in the streets. What did you say? You?ll throw me naked in the streets? Don?t you feel ashamed speaking to your wife.. ..in such a way. Come, throw me out, l?ll see. Throw me out. Where did l say that you are naked? Where did l say that? But l?ll throw you out. Will you go or not? You won't accept it like this. l?ll show you, l?ll show you right now. l?ll take your luggage and throw it away. What do you think you are? ? Hey, what are you doing? l?ll throw out your luggage.. What is the matter? Where are going with this bag? Going, who?s going? l was weight lifting, exercising. Yes. The husband who lives away from.. ..his wife for a month goes through this same state. ls it so? - Now, a small toy should come in this house. it's been quite a while that we've heard.. ..the voices of lullabies in this house. - Correct. Please do one thing. That old antique manger.. ..bring one and keep it in our house. All of us will sing lullabies then. Ravi, on Monday, it?s our marriage anniversary. The both of you should surely come. Why not, why not? if some trouble doesn't rear it?'s head.. ..and if l?m alive till then l?ll surely come. May God not send any problems to us! We?ll live together and we?ll die together. Wow. You both are an example for this world. We are not an example, we are incomparable. Please forget this example; l'll go to the office. l've to work. it?s ten O?clock. l?ll leave now. He?s very mischievous, isn't he? Come, sisters. Both of them are the same. They keep on fighting all the time. Wretch. Listen, my friends like your color, hairstyle.. ..and your personality too much. ls it so? Now with you, even your friends have seen me? Ask them that all they like is my color.. ..my hairstyle and my personality, isn't it? They don?t like anything else, do they? Yes, and they say that your husband is pure gold. Yes, why not? Go and mortgage me with them. You?ll get some money or something. O Go away! Will l mortgage you? You are the valuable of my life. You?re the pride of my eyes. You?re the peace of my heart. You?re a pure diamond. Okay! Now l understand why you are chasing me. You think, that l'm some billionaire?s son, isn't it? What do you think that you?ll loot money from me? But listen, l?m not a billionaire?s son. l?m a pauper. And also, also, l don?t even have a place to stay. l, myself am staying in a rented house. See, l?m just a common singer and dancer. For, God?s sake, quit chasing me around. Whatever you are, what is my business with that? l just know that you?re my husband, and me, your wife. See, listen to me, or else you?ll repent later. Why should l repent? What is my fault? Since the time l've come here you've been threatening me. As if l?m not your wife, but someone else. if l?m not your wife, then why have.. ..you attached my photo with yours? Oh, so if l attach our photos, you become my wife? in this house, l've put the photos of fifty heroines. Fifty heroines. That doesn't mean that they are my wives. They can never be your wife. Till the time l?m alive.. ..how can someone else be your wife? See, keep quiet, or else l?ll break your face! You?ll break my face? Break it. l?ll see how you break my face. Hey, do you go or not? ? Ravi! What is all this happening? l had told you, didn't l? That there shouldn't be any kind of fights or noise here? Are you remember? - l remember. Please forgive me. Okay. if any fight or noise occurs the next time.. ..l?ll remove you from this house right away. Yes, yes, yes. l understand. l understood. Today l kept silent because of her. But l?m warning you for the last time. if you don?t go away from here, till evening, till the time.. ..l return from the office, then today.. ..will be last day of your whole life. Never. Till the time the guardian of my life.. ..is with me, you can't harm me in any way. Okay, so you've prepared a fake symbol of marriage too? Who has tied it for you, tell me? O God, you?re the one who tied it.. ..and now, you?re asking me who tied it? l feel that my brains will blast with a huge explosion. Should l massage your head? Good for nothing! Let me come back in the evening. Then l?ll show you. Listen, what?ll you show me? Good for nothing! You?ll know in the evening what l?ll show. Take your food Tiffin at least. Good for nothing! Sticker! l should your! l should! You've not understood me at all, as yet. Ravi, there?s a very good chance for you. The singers and dancers of all over the country.. ..will be competing in a competition. And we wish that you should represent our association in it. Can l be in the All India Dance and Singing Competition? Of course. You don?t get such chances again, Ravi. Try your level best. Ravi, congratulations.

Yes.- Who told you to make Bitter gourd? Throw it away! ? Ravi, have you gone crazy? This poor girl has prepared bitter gourd for you.. ..so lovingly, and you are making her throw it out? Sit there quietly and eat. l said so, didn't l? - Okay, I'll eat it. Wow, there should be such a wife for everybody. You never told us that you?re married. That's excellent. ? it's excellent isn't it? Listen, please listen. - What is it? l want to see it from inside. Please show it. From inside? ? Yes.

Because the matter always starts from the hand.. ..and God knows till where it reaches then. hey, where are you running off too?? come here!? l?m incomplete without you, you?re incomplete without me.? O beloved, meet me, so that l become yours. Let us hug each other tightly, come let us play like this. Let us be lost in the dreams of love. The first night, of love for sleeping.. ..don?t waste them in just words. Hey, keep quiet. my wishes have been unfulfilled.? even though l?m a bride, l?m yet a spinster.? nor did my earrings fall, nor did my bangles smile.? even the kohl of my eyes has not been cleared yet.? Please go! O beloved, please don?t run away from me.? please keep asleep and awake with me.? what?s to be ashamed in this?? it's the duty of a husband. Tie me in your embrace.? Oh, shameless!

Marriage? Yes marriage. What is so shocking about it? No, you can't marry her. Why, why can l marry her? Who are you to stop me? l am your wife. You can't do such an injustice to me. if you can't tolerate injustice, then go and commit suicide. But, you better don?t meddle in my matters, understood? it's okay then. Tell me truly, do you really want to marry her? Yes, surely. it has been the tradition of our country.. ..that the husband and wife are bound to each other.. ..with the strings of love. But since the time witches like.. ..you've come like scissors, the strings have been cut. Hey listen. l didn't go and call him my darling. He himself called me darling and fell in my lap. isn't it darling? isn't it correct? Anyway, if your happiness lies in this.. ..then what problems can l have? it?s the duty of every wife to bow to her husband?s wishes. Sister, if you can give him the happiness.. ..that l can't give, then undoubtedly, you marry him. Really? This plan has failed too! Let us go home and make preparations for the marriage. Yes, honey, let's go home. if not honey? -go from here. Wasn't you the malaria enough.. ..that you?re talking about taking this cancer home? Yes, and you. ihad given you 500 Rs to act.

Ta-ta, I'll give her one kick with Bata, I'll smash her face. Come, let us go home. Which house, whose house? What house? l've no house. l?ll stay here, l?ll sleep here and eat here too. And l?ll go to my duty from here.. ..and return here directly from duty. That?s it. ls it so, what will you do for your meals? For my meals? l?ll eat fodder and grass. Oh no! l?ll bring food everyday for you here. That means, that means you won't leave me here too? No. ? O God! What sins had l committed in my previous life? Why have you stuck this forcible tail behind me? See, my mother, my father, my whole family! You won, and l lost. Please go away, please go away. - No You won't go? You won't go? l?ll strangle you! l?ll be back. Go, run away. ? Listen to me please. l told you not to follow me. ? Listen to me for a minute. She?s still following me, go run away.

Help! Oh, husband? Who husband? Which husband? What? Where did this husband come from? Wretched trouble! Yes, take her, take her away. Ravi, so what if she?s not your wife? She?s a woman, and it?s the duty of every man.. ..to save the dignity of a woman, Go, save her, Ravi! Ravi, Ravi, Ravi. Ravi?s leg has been taken care of. There?s none who can defeat me in the competition now. Sir, how is he now? Firstly, his leg has been fractured. Secondly, due to a serious wound in the head.. ..too much of blood has been shed. He needs blood. Because the hospital.. ..doesn't have O negative blood. Please arrange for it immediately. Sir, my blood comes in the O negative group. Please take my blood quickly. Please come with me. How is Ravi now? ? He?s all right now. ? ls it? You are very brave. You?ll be all right soon. Be brave, and listen, l?ll leave now, okay? Everything will be all right. l?ll leave now. Ravi has had a serious accident. Looking at the state that he?s in.. ..l don?t think that he can take part in this competition. Yes. This is a national level competition. And then, it?s the question of our Association?s honor. Yes. Therefore, l think that someone else.. ..should be chosen for this competition. But yes, remember, that Ravi shouldn't know about it. He?ll be very sad if he knows it. Sir, l wish to speak to you about something. Please come with me. ? Mrs. Kapoor, just a minute. Sir, l pray to you. You've given such.. ..a huge opportunity to Ravi, don?t snatch it away from him. l?m helpless, child. There are only.. ..ten days left for the program. Ravi?ll be unable to perform.. ..a program on the stage after ten days. it?s very difficult for him to be cured in ten days. Then dancing is a very far off thing. Ten days is too much of a time if God wishes.. ..he can change a man?s luck within a day. My heart says that Ravi?ll surely be cured. He has thought that this program.. ..is a dream of his lifetime. Please don?t break this dream. Otherwise, he will be heart broken. We, even we want that Ravi should.. ..participate in this competition. But what can we do? Do whatever you want. l fall at your feet. Get up, child. Sir, please let Ravi lose this opportunity. Please don?t let him lose this chance. l take the responsibility to cure him. it?s good then, dear. if you take the responsibility.. ..if you have so much belief in your prayers. if you believe in your God so much.. ..then Ravi will surely take part in this competition. Okay, are you happy now? Can l leave now? Thank you very much. ? God bless you. Teacher! Hey Teacher! What is all this? This is strange! l was in Delhi. l was in the Budget Session. l can to know about this there. l took off from Delhi.. ..and landed here in Mumbai. You had such a huge accident.. ..and you didn't even inform me? l won't spare you. l?ll send all the ruffians on a vacation. l?ll make the police beat half of them.. ..and l myself will beat the other half. Like that, everything is all right, isn't it? There is no danger, isn't it? What kind of a donkey am l? The person.. ..who was in the hospital, if he?s come home.. ..it means that his danger has passed over. When a person drinks less, this is what happens with him. All kind of wrong things are uttered from his mouth. l drank three quarters, how many, three. But l got the intoxication of only one quarter. Nowadays they mix too much of water. l was in Delhi. l shouted in the Parliament. When will the ruffians of this country stop? Mothers are being raped, sisters are being widowed. Orphans are shedding their blood like water. And my friend is writhing with wounds. When will those wounds be cured? l shook the whole of Delhi and kept it in my pocket. And now, hey you didn't eat the fruit? Please have it, it is very sweet. Uncle, - Yes? ? Please take this tea. Daughter, please don?t call me uncle, he gets angry on me. Daughter, it?s not time for me to have tea. My time for drinking tea is different. in the morning, from getting up from the sleep till sleeping.. ..again in the night, l don?t drink tea. l drink tea after that. Now, it?s time for me to drink this. Ravi, Seeing your state, I'm very sad, friend. if you permit, can l have some of this? Let it be, l?ll not drink. Daughter, don?t worry. if you've any problem, call me in the middle of the night. l?ll come on my head. l?ll come walking on my head. You don't worry. And Ravi, you get well soon. l?ll just.. ..drown his quarter in the drain of my gullet. Just l go and return. Don?t worry, as soon as l go, l?ll come back. Where is he going? What place is this? it?s stinking here. Where is the door? it?s there. ? it?s there? While coming it was here. How did it go there? Okay, I'm going. Urvashi! Urvashi! You have fever. Did you eat anything or not? - l had eaten the God?s offering. God?s offering? You have only God's offering from next tomorrow!. Have you decided to die? See, daughter, life and death is in the hands of God. What?s the use in getting so worried about it? l just pray to God, that he gets well soon. So that he?s able to compete in the competition. So that he goes there, he sings, wins and gets an award. He becomes famous. His life?s ambition is fulfilled. For that. God make me ill forever for that. Yes, Mother, this is what l want. This is what l want. My name has been printed in the invitation card. l can participate in the competition. l will dance, l will sing. l will.. ..but my leg's fracture band hasn't been opened yet. My leg has been broken. And with my leg breaking.. ..all the ambitions of my life have been broken too. l won't take any steps hastily and make him a cripple for life. Have patience, everything will be all right. Go, go home. Till the time you don?t open his plaster, l won't go home. impossible. Till today, this hasn't happened in medical.. ..history. Try to understand me. l don?t know anything about your medical history. l have full faith in my God. He will never disappoint me. impossible. This can't be done. if you don?t open his plaster, then l?ll do it myself. l can't do anything in this matter. At least try for me. l beg of you. But remember, if anything happens to him.. ..you?ll be responsible for that, okay? ? Yes. ? Come. Daughter, your God has listened to you. Daughter, l've lost and you have won. ? What? The bone has connected! l?ll break dance!? l?ll leave only after making everybody dance!? l?ll break all the records!? come let us dance, come let us love.? there are so many beautiful and lovely faces here.? our life is here, dancing, singing and being happy.? 'Dance! Sing! ? Dance! Sing!' 'Dance, Sing! Wow! Wow!' even the heart works with rhythm.? heart beat is the name of rhythm.? the world works on rhythm, The name of rhythm is life.? even the stars as well as the light dances.? the earth as well as the sky dances.? the flowers as well as Babban dances!? Ravi, Ravi! Ravi. Congratulations. Ravi, winning this award, you've kept our name high. All this is your mercy, sir. if you hadn't given me a.. ..chance, then forget about this award, even that a singer.. ..named Ravi existed in this city wouldn't be known But the truth is that, We've not given you this chance. it was your wife who forced us to give you this chance. What? ? Yes, when you were in the hospital.. ..we had decided that you would not be taking part in the. ..competition, because you weren't able to dance But your wife, cried, requested, and even fell.. ..at our feet, requested us, that we shouldn't snatch.. ..this golden opportunity of your life. She took the full responsibility of curing you and bringing.. ..you on stage. We were forced to give you this chance. Therefore the real heir of these thanks is not us, but your wife. Yes, Ravi! Urvashi! Where has she gone? Urvashi? When did you come back? ? Greetings mother. Bless you. ? Mother, l won this competition by your blessings. l got this gold medal. ? Congratulations son. May God give you more success! l would have come myself, but l was ill. l saw your program on the television. The country?s such a great artist lives in my house.. ..knowing this, my head was high with pride. Mother, where is my wife? ? Wife? Say it again. ? Where is my wife? Today, for the first time, listening the word ?wife?.. ..for Urvashi, l feel very happy. Son, very lucky people get such a wife. Everybody makes a show of serving. But the real service is which the husband won't realize. Since the time you had gone to the hospital.. ..like a crazy girl, that girl has been.. ..going to temples, mosques, and churches. She kept praying and fasting for your health and success. Otherwise, dancing and singing is another matter.. ..you wouldn't even be cured by now. Even the doctors themselves are surprised. Mother, where is Urvashi? To pray for your health, she has gone to Bholenath temple. Urvashi. That?s enough. Please stop this difficult vow. God has listened to your request. Only l got the first prize in such a huge competition. l got this prize, this medal and this shawl. But, but whatever Ravi got, he got it only because of you. See, Urvashi, see, open your eyes. Please. Take this. All this yours, yes. l sung on the stage. But every word of my son was.. ..indebted to you. The hall was echoing with applause. But from every applause, bless Urvashi?.. ..?May Urvashi live long!? That was what being heard. l don?t even know you. for an stranger.. ..you served me so, you served me so, that rarely.. .. must a wife would have served her husband such. You worshipped this God from morning till evening. But l, l should pray to this Goddess. Urvashi, you've given me a new life, you are my Goddess. God, you've succeeded my penance. You've fulfilled my ambitions, you've heard my prayers. You've proved today, that you keep the respect.. ..of real love and real penance. You've kept a woman?s dignity today. You saved my love from being ruined. Ravi, you, do you? Yes, Urvashi, to which God you have been praying.. ..l keep him as my witness and tell you that l love you. l have faith in your words. l don?t need any vow. l've faith in my love. Today, you've confessed your love. l shall tell you, in my mind, the truth of your love. it was a Diwali Night. l had seen you singing alone. since the time l've seen you, l've asked you from God.? 'You're the reason to live.' You?re so beautiful, l could see you all my life.? 'That closeness, you gave it to me.? 'You won my heart.? Your eyes shied away, my heartbeats stopped.? "My love was awakened." let the story start at least, let the lips touch the flower.? the silky hair moved there, the light shone somewhere.? my house was brightened.? Your song has become the support of my life. l've begun to fall in love with you. l feel, that l should run towards you. l should cut my chest up, and place my heart at your feet. When l couldn't tolerate my love for you any longer.. ..then, one day, l came to your house to confess my love. Okay, father. ? Ravi, l've become old now. l want that you should marry and settle your house now. No, Daddy. l don?t want to be trapped.. ..in the trap of house and household now. First, let me fulfill the ambition of my life. l want to become a famous singer and dancer. l don?t want to bury my voice beneath stoves and vessels. Okay, as you wish. Ravi, when my old eyes close themselves.. ..who will take care of you and look after you? No, daddy. Don?t say such inauspicious things. ? Why? in this city of Bombay, thousand and millions of people.. ..stay unprotected and orphans. l?ll stay just as one of them. ls this your final decision? ? Yes father. The All India Talent Association has called me for an interview. l?m going to Bombay today. Yes, if you know anyone in Bombay.. ..then please give me his name and address. l?ll take his help. One needs support in an unknown city. Here, this is my friend. He is quite a working wheel. He?ll be of some help to you. Okay, l?ll go now. Greetings. ? Bless you. Write a letter, surely okay. You went to Bombay from there. When l returned.. ..sad to my place, what did l see there? That my father was confirming my marriage proposal.. ..to a Thakur's son, without even asking me. The one to whom l had given my heart.. ..leaving him, how could l leave him and.. ..tie the nuptials with someone else.. ..and take the sacred rounds around the sacred pyre? The funeral pyre would be better than that. Then l decided to leave the house.. ..and decided to come here to you in Bombay. My aunt Y was surprised on seeing me there all of a sudden. But she supported me like her daughter. Actually, Sampat Shrivastav is my real uncle. And just like a crazy girl, without thinking anything.. ..leaving my parents, l came to you. And l started living with you, forcibly acting as your wife. But today l?m very happy, on seeing.. ..that you've succeeded in your ambition in life. Your ambition has been fulfilled. But due to me.. ,,you had to face too many problems. For that, l beg your forgiveness. No, Urvashi. You've given me any trouble. You've given good sense to a stupid person like me, You?re not my fan from today, you?re my wife. You?re my life. in front of this God, accept you. - Daddy! - Silent! Shameless! Loose girl! Before.. ..crossing the limits of the house, why didn't you die? Daddy, l.. ? Silent! Speak in a low voice, or l?ll snatch your tongue. Firstly, without any marriage, you.. ..stayed as the fake wife of a rogue. Also wore a fake symbol of the marriage too? You have turned the father?s dignity into mud.. ..and on top of that, you?re showing me your eyes? l?ll shatter your eyes and make you blind, understand that. The people who would shatter the eyes are dead. This is my brother?s daughter understood? Sampat is alive as yet. Let anyone just.. ?touch my child and see. l?ll uproot the hands like dry grass. Sampat! ? Lower your eyes and speak in a low tone. if l start shouting, then how the glass cylinder bursts.. ..just like that the cylinder of your fake dignity will be burst. Uncle! ? hey, why are you crying. Your father is a very cheap man. Why are you wasting.. ..your precious tears for that cheap man? And your uncle is alive yet. He has uprooted.. ..the pillars of so many people. What is this .. ..without wall poster do to us, don?t cry. Come. Yes, so what were you saying to my brothers? daughter? That you?re her father? With what right.. ..do you say that she is your daughter? What have you given her till today? Love, respect, did you give her anything? Just like a cow's kid, you've given her to servants.. ..and you yourself have been accumulating notes. You've been a leader to fool the innocent people. And have played the political strategies. Did you sit with her for even a day and ask.. ..Daughter, what is your problem, why are you sad? What problem? l never gave her a chance to ask anything. Even before she asked, l fulfilled all her needs. Food, drinks, money, valuables, what didn't l give her? See, in the orphanages of America.. ..the children there get more than this. So the trustees don?t become their parents. Just as this woman can't become his wife.. ..by wearing his symbol of marriage.. ..just like that, you can't become her father by feeding her. A father is that person who gives his kids the morsel of advice. A father is one who gives his kids.. ..the treasure of love from his mind? safe of honesty. What have you given her? Sampat, l haven?t come here to take your advice. Even l don?t want to ruin my advice by giving it to you. l ask you just one thing. When this girl loves him, why have you come.. ..here to meddle your scary leg? Mr. Sampat. Please let me speak. l?ll tell father in law. Don?t you dare call me your father in law! Yes, call me smaller father in law and answer him. There, not me. l love your girl. l really love her, and she loves me too. l?m poor. l can't give you big promises.. ..but l can promise you that l will keep your daughter happy. All we need is your permission. Because it is.. ..our duty to marry according to your permission. l request you, and beg you for your permission. See, this is honesty , true lovers. You?re not worth to be asked permission.. ..but even then, he is asking for your permission. Otherwise, as it is they are half tied in the.. ..bonds of marriage in the eyes of the world.. ..the other half will be tied by me. After that.. ..you will be the grandfather of the child that is born.. ..but l will be called as his grandfather. Don?t talk rubbish, Sampat. How do l permit? How do l knowingly push my daughter in the fire of hunger? What is his worth? ls he worth my daughter? Why is he worth your daughter? ls he blind, lame or a beggar? He is a very strong and healthy man. He is famous singer. He is the star who will shine in art?s sky tomorrow. l?m not talking about tomorrow. l?m talking about today. What does he have? First of all he is orphan. He has a common government job, with a salary. He doesn't even have a house to stay. Where will he keep my daughter? - On the foot path? ? No. Mother? - When this mother?s huge house is present.. ..why will he stay on the foot path? Mother? - Yes. Mother l am alone in this world. l've none else left. Therefore, accepting Ravi as my son.. ..l?m naming my house, wealth and bank balance to Ravi. Therefore, he isn't a beggar any more. He is rich, and he is dignified, did you understand? Did you understand or not, or should l make you understand? Whether he agrees or not, they will be married. They are mature adults, Nobody can stop them from marrying. Okay, it will happen as you wish. l am agreeable to this marriage. Are you telling the truth, or are you looking.. ..at the chance and chancing your party? No, l?m telling the truth, Where the daughter agrees.. ..there the father agrees too. And as Lilavati has said correctly. Where do you get such a boy in today?s world. See, l have a sincere request. The marriage.. ..should take place at my place. if this marriage takes place at my place.. ..then my dignity will be restored. Otherwise.. ..the world will say that the daughter married.. ..against her father?s wishes. l agree, what do you say Sampat? - Okay. Okay. l?ll find an auspicious occasion and inform you. Come them daughter, let us go home.. ..and make preparations for the marriage. Brother Sampat, for the first time in life.. ..you did a good thing by opening my eyes. l've always done good things, what can l do if you understood.. ..it for the first time? l?ll leave you till the car Okay, mother, l?ll leave now. Okay. ? Okay. ? Come now! Urvashi! ? Let me go! -What is this dad? Silence! l acted sincerely there and brought you here. Otherwise, how can l accept defeat so easily? l?ll allow your marriage to that two bit worth boy? Never! Listen to this. if you marry, you will marry only this boy. Otherwise, you?ll not marry anyone. Understood? Never daddy. l have accepted Ravi as my husband.. ..through my heart. if l marry, l?ll marry Ravi, or nobody else! No, Urvashi, please don?t say like this. Today is our marriage; the invitation cards've been distributed. Shut up. l?ll die but l will not marry you. l just have to marry you off. Do whatever you want after that. Please, let our families be united. Shameless, how dare you raise your hand.. ..on your would be husband? Come! Come with me! - Father! Come, dare you move from here! Hello! Ravi. Urvashi here. - Urvashi! He has brought me here forcibly. That was his entire trick. He is marrying me off to another boy today. You come.. Hello! Listen, Ravi has come to know about the wedding. He will try to reach here under any circumstances. But you don?t let him reach here. Send your boys on all the sides. if he tries to come even then.. ..then kill him. Priest, do it fast. Please hurry. Now, stand up for the rounds. Chandu, finish off this rogue! if any one moves, l?ll kill him! Urvashi! Priest, read the hymns. Wait, or else l?ll kill you. Kill him, what else can you do? After the election, you kill promises made.. ..and the rights of the poor people.. ..and after marriage, kill your son in law. Son in law! What nonsense are you talking? l?m not talking nonsense, but announcing it for your benefit. See there. He has just made your daughter.. ..his wife, and you want to shoot him.. ..and make your daughter a widow? l..l don?t believe in such a marriage. What will your belief or non belief harm now? But, in my eyes, he is not her husband. But in the eyes of the religion, he is, in the eyes of society.. ..he is, he is in the eyes of the law. This is not a political post, that you sit on it.. ..whenever you want, and get up whenever you want. This is the seat of an Indian girl?s fate. Whoever she allows to sit there once.. ..he becomes her God. And you have no right to shoot her God. Go, my blessings are with you, Gods blessings are with you. What will this person stop you? Go, l?ll see. Shoot! Why don?t you shoot? Till when will you see the world the eyes of money? if you have the eyes of your heart, then see there. Love and see!
