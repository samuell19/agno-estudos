We had a disagreement about who the skull belonged to. - What did you do? - I shot the scallywag is what I did. Well, he took a shot at me first, so I had to teach him a lesson, and I left him to die in the Mojave Desert. - And that was that? - Yeah, that was that. - Gramps, did you ever rob a stagecoach? - Sure.

Charlie, get up! - Jess, this better be real important. - Gramps lost the skull. - He what? - Somebody, I don't know who, stole it. He's dying Charlie. We gotta get it back. - After all we did for him, he loses it! I can't believe he did that, Jess! I mean, I've never met anyone so irresponsible! You know I risked my life... - Charlie! [DOORBELL RINGING] Yeah? - Bill, Bill Towner, electrician. - JESSE: Uh, Jesse McLaughlin. - Nice to meet you, Jesse. A young lady called, said you needed some work done. - She did, huh? Oh, wait... - Where's the fuse box, down there in the basement? - Uh, listen, Bill, I'm sorry to trouble you, but this really isn't the right time. - Hey, that's all right, Jess, I'm not gonna get in your way. You just show me what needs fixin'. This is quite a room you got here. Yeah, very, very nice. That's a weird fireplace though. - Yeah, uh, Bill... - So what do we got in here? Ah, there it is. Freemon 240, these old houses are loaded with 'em. So this the room you're havin' problem here with, Jess? - Uh, yeah, all along this wall, but the rest of the house is fine. [GLASS SHATTERING] I wouldn't worry about that, Jesse. It didn't look too valuable. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Just as I'd expected. Jess, you got a problem here, but hey, like with any problem, you know, you don't wanna let it get the best of you. You know, I've been workin' on these houses, oh, about 20 years now and I've seen enough tragedy and disaster to make you wanna up chuck in your shorts. You see, these old houses, they just got minds of their own, you know, and ya just gotta teach 'em who's boss. You know, sorta give 'em a spankin'. [GLASS SHATTERING] Huh, must be foreign made. Well, I'm gonna fix this old house up for you, Jess, just like it's brand spankin' new. [BUZZING AND BEEPING] [WHIRRING] - What is that? - Shh. [WHIRRING] Uh-huh. Oh. Ooh. - What, what do you hear? - Ah, Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess. It's not good. I've seen this before and... it's always made my adenoids curdle. Oh, hey, don't monkey with those switches, Jess. It'll blow us both to Milwaukee. It's touch and go from here, pal. Could go either way, Jess. Oh, yeah, yeah, Jess, want to step into my office here for a second? Listen, buddy, I like to be alone with my work, so if you don't mind... - Yeah. - You got somethin' to do? - Sure. - Go do it, buddy, go do it. Go do it. [LAUGHING] Nice kid. [HEROIC MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Whoops. [MISCHIEVOUS MUSIC] Weird. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - You see anything? - Forget it. I'm not goin' up there. Gramps can get his own damn skull. - Come on, Charlie, Gramps said they went in here, so don't wimp out on me now. - Hey, buddy. [SCREAMS] Oh, scared ya, huh? Relax. - Oh, God, Bill, are you all right? - Yeah, fine. Fine, fine. - Who is this? - Uh, Bill. - Bill Towner, electrician. - Charlie Coriell, entrepreneur. - Uh, listen, fellas, we got a little problem in the other room. I think you'd better come have a look. - Look, Bill, I'm sorry, but this really isn't a good time. Why don't you pack it up and come back tomorrow? - I think we better go in the other room and have a look. [SIGHS] Well, there it is.
