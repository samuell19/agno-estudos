Cigarette smoking & alcohol consumption are injurious to health. It causes cancer. Generation changes. Girl grows up. From someone who just cooks at home, she now gets accolades. But in the hands of the beasts who are disguised as men she ends up dead. So, let's save the girl child and save the mother. Remember, their safety is our responsibility. "Don't trust this night" "the magic which comes over" "closes the eyes" "and push towards intoxication" "It closes your eyes" "and pushes you towards..." "The darkness that throws a net of dreams" "Don't trust this night" "the magic which comes over" In this pond, there are two type of fish, One is vegetarian fish which eats grass and algae and second is non vegetarian fish which eats insects and frogs. the third type of fish enters in certain unnatural conditions. it's a Devil fish.! It eats all the fish around, after their extinction, they eat there own race, finally it will take the entire life out of the pond, that is Devil fish. 'His name is Abhi... Abhiram.' 'Don't know if it's a curse or boon' 'he can remember anything after reading once.' Hey Xerox! Show me, idiot. It's almost time. I didn't see anything idiot. You called me Xerox. That's all the time you get. 'Generally, everyone gets punished for their mistakes in school.' But he... - Latin word. Sir. Algebra is a Arabic word, not Latin. It means reunion of broken parts. All you do is insult a teacher with your Wikipedia knowledge. Are you feeling like Einstein? Arrogant idiot. 'He is trying from his childhood to bridge the gap' 'between him and the world.' Look, rock is drinking milk. Not God. It's called capillary action. They are all insane. Do you think you are Socrates to question people's belief? Can't you filter your mind and words? If I filter the truth then it would be a lie. Are you punishing me to tell lies? 'His name is Dasarath.' 'After Abhi's mother died,' 'Abhi needed a mother, so, he married Kamala.' 'After her husband died,' 'she felt her daughter needed a father,' 'and married Dasarath.' 'You may think his problems are with his step mother...' What is this? 'Dasarath is an average Group one Gazetted officer.' 'So, his hands work in a way' 'where he won't ask for a bribe' 'but you will end up bribing.' Hey, do you want money? From now on, for staying in you house and eating your food, fee. Where did you get this money? Bye teacher. Bye brother. Bye sir. Bye Teacher, Bye brother. From now on I am corruption free, Mr.Dasarath. 'Like this, he focused detachment with his father,' 'and the frustration on books' 'and went on to write IAS to MIT in America.' Instead of wasting time writing all types of exams, if he focuses on one exam, he will pass for sure, madam. How can you say he didn't pass any of these exams? So, he doesn't have clarity. This is for him. These all are for his ego. He is very clear. The world around him is confused. Hey, Whom did you vote? I voted for you, brother. Brother, you said you will vote for us. I voted for you too, brother. If you vote for them, I will buy you a three wheel scooter. "Are we true to Democracy?" "All this nice of people" Sister! Sister, who are you voting for? For Vishakha Vani's party. How much did she give? - 5000 per vote Is it? Then CM didn't give you anything? CM has given 10,000 per vote. Then you should vote for him, right? I have voted 2 times for him before, Sister started new party, let's see what will she give if she wins. Wow, you are very Intelligent. Hey, retired IAS office Ramprakesh, he is well educated. Don't you want to vote for him? He didn't even give 100 bucks. Stupid fellow. What he will do if he wins? That's it, if they didn't give money they will loss, If they give money not sure they will won the election. What do you mean? - Power of Democracy. First all those leaders should stop giving money. Or else they will take money from every one and vote as they like. That's also power of democracy, man. - Yes. Ravuri Deepak - Okay. Kanchekarla Rajashaker! You have voted, go away. Do I have ink mark? - No. Did the face match? Yes. It means my vote was rigged, right? Hello, the booth is rigged, all of you can go home. Hey, wait! Don't go. Are you acting smart? According to election rule, if your vote is missing, you have to sign on tender ballot and leave. My vote is not missing. It is clearly rigged. How can the booth continue? Hey, who are you to stop? Are you a Poling office to ask me? No, right? Leave now. Who is he? Call the concerned Poling officer. Till then polling should not happen. What is the problem here? - Oh. Are you the concerned Poling officer? Which party bribed you this time? This is not a right place to show your attitude. Shut up and sign on the tender ballot and move on. How can I sign on tender ballot? My vote is rigged. Who knows how many have been rigged? - Abhi! You have to stop the booth. Don't make a scene here, let's move. Hey, I know what I am doing, leave me. - Hey Abhi, Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it. Hey! Hey! Oh! Stop it! Stop. I said stop. Stop. What is the problem? Because his vote was missing, he wants to stop the Poling. - It wasn't missed. It was rigged. - Hey! If the vote was rigged then sign on tender ballot and move on. You are not supposed to fight. Oh, when I am saying my vote is rigged, this is how you react? If we talk logically, not only this booth you have to stop the total election. The go and complain to Election commission. Not here. I will talk to them as well. There is a lot of difference between missing vote and rigged vote. Even if one vote is rigged, it can't be called democracy. If one murder is not a crime, 100 murders are not crime either. How can we say only one vote was rigged? How can we say only this booth was rigged? 100% rigging free election is the very foundation of any democracy. As an in charge, at least you should disqualify this booth. He is your son, right? Yes, sir. Sign the tender ballot and leave politely. Otherwise, I will file a case as urban Naxals, and put all of you in jail. You know what that means, right? MIT admission and America dreams, will go down the drain. Get the hell out of here. Aren't you ashamed to say this? As a collector, you are the supreme authority of the district You should file a case on those goons who beat us up in presence of the police. They are the real urban naxals. How can you protect them and threaten us? Let's keep the emotions aside and talk As you said, I am a shameless fellow. Not just me, your father, and all the police around too. Civil servants like me who are the foot mats of politicians, isn't much different from those goons. Brother, everyone in this country, are living on the calculations of how much they will earn if they do engineering, medicine or MBA. But, whoever prepares for civil exams, want to serve the country. but once they are in the system for six months, like you asked, learn how to live shamelessly. Don't throw stones from outside, come into it and live like us then you will know. This booth belongs to Vishakha Vani. It will be risk for me if I stop it, if you want to stop then it will be a risk for you. So don't waste your life, in this one side war and take your flight and move on. You will be in US in a week, leave them be. Escapists don't have a right to talk about this. Go! "My life is with you, my body filled with thirsts" "the song of silence is the answer to my question" "This damsel is like sour grapes" "Even a million words aren't enough to write about her" "She is longed by everyone" "She is the revolutionary freedom" "She is the colorful dream of my eyes" "She is the colorful dream of my eyes" "She is the life of my imagination" "She is a part of my life." "And the meaning for my breath" "After braving the darkness and fighting with Englishmen" "we saved the damsel in distress and celebrated" "We figured that she vanished" "And she is now captured in a cage" "We can't seem to find her" "Without her there is no value for humans" "What fight should we start to reach her?" "Which weapon to use to win her back?" "From times immemorial everyone claims they own her" "and always locked her up." "They broke her wings and took away her rights" "and stamped down on everyone who questioned." "It's crushed in history of humanity" "And the damsel if nothing but freedom" "She flows in our veins" "And the invisible light who shows the way" REPUBLIC Open the door, stubborn fellow. It will take 7 hours to reach Hyderabad even if we start now. Will you spoil your life listening to some one? Listen to me and come down. What will you do by leaving MIT and joining IAS? For you attitude you will suffer, otherwise you will become mad. I was happy he was going to America. Now he is back to his tantrums. At least you guys tell him. In an IAS interview only one will get selected out of three. He may fail. Why are you worrying now? My dear, Only one will pass out of 500 in mains. He passed in that with half knowledge. Do you think interview will be difficult for him? Hey, you will suffer about this decision. Come down, son. Let me try till I suffer, Mr. Dasarath. I am 25 now. Let me live my life. You have been doing the same since you were five. You will miss the flight. Come down. Dad, will you stop, if he jumps from the terrace he won't catch the flight still. Stay calm. Let's go. Look Mr. Dasarath, You know me better than anyone in this world. If you cancelled the ticket in time, you might have saved one lakh. Don't include that in my account. If you are not going to America then don't step in to the house. How can you send him out like that! He grew up as per his wishes and he will live as per his wish. Why does he need us? Hey, will you give your penthouse for rent? I will pay 5000 more, because there will be no taunts from my dad. Stop it and let's move. - Take that bag. Then Mufasa stood on a cliff, and asked Simba to run away without turning back. Why didn't Mufasa run from there? He has to fight with the enemies to save Simba. It's been 23 days seeing dad, Aunty. He didn't even call us. There is no signal where dad is. that's why he didn't call. Your dad misses you as much as you miss him. See, If you go to school, then daddy will come. Hi Myra, any news? No, - What did the police say? As usual, they say they are searching. Oh God. Any clues from hospital? Nothing dear, I will let you know if I find any thing. Hey Myra! Yeah? I don't know if there's link between this and your brother missing, on that day. Nurse told me that a goon named Guna consulted Varun. Is this Democracy? In last week's election, with in a hour of opening the booth a young man's vote was rigged and he asked this question. Is this arrogance or stupidity, because of his one missing vote, he can't blame the whole system. without having practical knowledge on the system it's better to leave the country. The youngster argues that this country doesn't belong to one person and whoever questions the system can't be called an anti-national and be asked to leave the county. The father's anguish is that anger will ruin oneself. Hey, Where is the news? News was not printed. Hey, don't lie, tell me the truth. - Mom don't beat me tell me the truth, did you fight with someone ? Sister wait, without anything did principal call the parents? Sister, - What did you do? Tell me truth, don't lie Why are you beating him like this? Ask him what happened? He didn't hurt his nose because of cricket, he fights with someone, without parents they will not allow to school he told and went - So will you kill him. enemies will not come from outside they will be resemble of parents Because of his coaching, he become like that You go I will take care.

I didn't hit Pete, What a shame, there is nothing here to feel shame, there is a different feeling of love for them and you according to their feeling, love means liking a person, they will learn about relation in every stage how purely we react, they will also treat same Hey Arya, say sorry to Aunty and promise her that you will not talk to Priya I am sorry. - No wait. Pete say sorry for hitting Arya. What Mam? why are you saying sorry?

EVM has been rigged. She will not give support to the, central Indian Democratic Party. Mrs. Vishakha Vani son's Kaikaluru MLA Vishnu Vardhan, formed government in front of Governor Ramakanth With full loyalty... What are the four defined pillars of democracy? People have right to select the government. Majority rules. Elected government, should not have difference between Race, Religion, cast... People should be treated equally... Long live Visakha Vani! You are Markadeyulu's supporter, right? I will see how will run the school from now. "Vishakha Vani" long live Should not work for, Law and Justice. In this new government, 9 collector, 6 SP, 2 high court judge are been transfers. In the first 3 years, plan it according, do the murders and corruption, Last 2 years thing about how get votes. Voter is like a kid, beat him till evening, at the end give him biscuit, he will be happy. We are cancelled all the contacts, and issuing reverse tendering.

You think about your companies, We will think about economy. What we have to do tell me mam? Do it as same, what you did with before party. Do that. We should protect fundamental rights like speech, education, profession. Guna sir is here. You could have asked him to come he can have some coffee. He is not getting down because if he gets down he has to have coffee and it will upset his tummy. How many people work in the factory? 5000 people, sir. How much would the monthly salary cost? Around three crores. If you put that three in this account, we will supply the workers for you every month. We should take people's opinion on Government's decisions. Like Even if you commit a murder, it should have grandeur, that's when opposition will be in defence. Previous government got a court order asking to relieve Telleru encroachment till Edo Komaturu as per farmer's wishes. 'State government has released a controversial GO,' 'paying no heed to Supreme court's judgment,' 'that encroachment can continue till' 'Mudo Pranthur for fishing.' 'While the fishermen celebrated the GO' 'the farmers are unhappy and furious about it.' We have been crying out loud that our lives are destroyed because of the encroachments, how can you give way to new encroachments? They seem to think they can do as they please as they have government support. We are announcing a District wide Bandh on 16th of this month as the farmer victims of this GO. That's the situation, dude. A change of government means old goons are out new goons are in. You are coming here on my house warming day, showing fake documents and saying this plot is yours. Do I look like an idiot? This is mine. - You are done with written test, you need so many books for interview too? There won't be special syllabus for interview dude. That is why I have to go through all these. Now do you know why I don't take these tests? Hey! - Oh! When the house is being built you didn't realize? You are getting it built anyways. I came to do my house-warming. Go to hell! He stopped me too. 'He is not a moron to sell the same plot to two people.' Hey, you built a house in my plot, now leave. Hey, you anyway's took away farming from us. Now, you are trying to take away the house we built with so much hard work. You will be destroyed. - Hey! Show the original documents. This is my original document. - I have the original one too. Hey ladies, get out. I will kill you if you touch the ladies. Then go get a court order. You should be going to court. - Give me the document, brother. Who are you? Hey! The survey number in your document is different. It was different when we purchased. You should be the one running away? For illegally entering a property, even if you are killed it's not a crime. Ask him his whereabouts. What are you doing, old lady? Who do you want to given oblation? You old lady... Hey! You asked for a court order, right? The court is here, see. You look like a nerd. People like you will be safe if you are buried in the books. If you try to poke your nose in unnecessary businesses, you will be squashed. Go and bury yourself in books. You are the one who should be out from here. Right. I am born with a knife and I have been hacking anyone and everyone who came in my way. Hey, life is sensitive. You blow and it will be off. Stop staring. Stop staring! Stop staring! Who are you? Who the hell are you? We will solve the problem among ourselves. Go and show your heroism to your dad. Officers like your dad are the reason two survey numbers are allotted to the same plot, and two plots with same survey numbers. Go and show your public welfare performance there. Hey, get lost. Why do you bother? - Brother. Please keep the knife away. We will talk and settle this. There is nothing to talk about. You said you will start a Bandh on Telleru GO. Take it back. Or... I will kill you and live with your wife in your home. Hello, - Are we going? Don't know. She's still on Face time. Who is she talking to? - Fiance. How long will it take? - Might take two-three hours. Sometime it takes all day. Oh no, just ask her. I can't. Let her finish. So, what are you doing? How can you say that, you insensitive bastard? You must be a moron to even suggest that. I saw a glimpse of my future with you and it's scary. 'You are blowing this out of proportion, Myra.' Stop your bullshit. 'Who is she shouting at?' - Fiance. Are they breaking up? Don't know. Aunty, are you breaking up with Nithin uncle? Who are you talking to? Arya is asking if we are going to bird sanctuary. Priya, please hang up the phone and do your homework. Did they break up, dude? How do I know? Please take us to the bird sanctuary, uncle. Hey, I have an interview in a week Go and ask your grandpa. No, he is so boring. Please take us, uncle. Please. - Nonsense. Hey, this is Myra. Oh! Hi! I promised to take the kids to bird sanctuary. But, my mood is not great today. If you don't mind and if you are free, can you take them please. Of course, I am free. In fact I am bored too, I will take them. Thank you, I'll see you. 'Hello! Myra!' Yeah, you say your mood isn't great, it would be great if you can join us too. I promise, you will not regret it. Moreover, a fair is going on, it will be very beautiful. 'Please join us.' Okay. - Okay. Are you ready as soon as you heard break-up? How dare you rag me! "Tamarind seeds on the tender hands" "Marks of shy on the beautiful cheeks" "Shall we go to see or shall we go to play?" "Shall we go to see or shall we go to play?" "Shall we join together and hold our hands?" "Shall we go to see or shall we go to play?" "Sal we join together and hold our hands?" "The sails are down with full force" "Ship is in full swing" "The sails are down with full force" "Ship is in full swing" "Th fair is on, put on the flower garlands" "Bow to the Goddess who saves us" "Th fair is on, put on the flower garlands" "Bow to the Goddess who saves us" "The pond is taking a shower in the moon light" "Shall we go, shall we go?" "The moon is romancing the pond" "Shall we go, shall we go?" "The flowers are feeling shy when the breeze touches them" "Shall we go, shall we go?" "The migratory birds are here to play the game of colours" "The sails are down with full force" "Ship is in full swing" "The sails are down with full force" "Ship is in full swing" "The form of Goddess Parvathi" "Goddess Peddintlamma!" "She is here for the people of Kolleru" "Goddess Peddintlamma!" "Let's play the traditional dance with the lamps" "Shall we go, shall we go?" "The couple who prayed will get married" "The sails are down with full force" "Ship is in full swing" "The sails are down with full force" "Ship is in full swing" Go faster, brother. Be careful. We won! We won! 'We won!' "Hey Priya, slow down.' 'This is soap water. It will get into your eyes.' Arya, stop it. - Arya, look at that. I lied to the kids that their dad went for research in Africa. They believed in that and living happily. I am scared that the smile will be erased from their face. It's been 30 days that my brother went missing. I don't know what happened to him. I am more scared after knowing that on the day he went missing, he met a goon named Guna. Police is not paying heed. Varun met collector before the day he went missing. On the same day, a goon named Guna met Varun. Why are you not considering this as a kidnap case, sir? What do you mean? Me, collection and the goon joined hands and kidnapped your brother? 'I wanted to adopt the kids and take them to America with me,' 'since the kids are Indian citizens' 'they needed the parents signatures' 'or their death certificates.' Their death certificates. 'It's like I am stuck in a limbo.' 'Without a conclusion to the case.' Nothing is more important than them to me. I want to adopt them. But that bastard... My fiance... asked me to admit the kids in an orphanage. That's why I broke up with him. Myra, a person who can't see motherhood in a girl isn't human. You are their mother in this situation. Only those who understand that should be in your life. Take it easy. Hello. - ' Hanson?' Yes. - 'Can you come to office once?' They found them while fishing in Telleru. Hmm. Did not find the body in the surroundings. No bloodstains on the clothes. Our investigation showed that you brother was depressed after his wife's death and became an alcoholic. We found out he was suicidal. Sir, look at those kids once. Which dad will leave them and commit suicide? Are you a psychiatrist? Do you know how the mind of depressed people work? More than solving the crime, seems like your mind is set on showing it like a suicide. If there are no blood stains, do you consider it as suicide? Won't you search for the body? That lake leads to the ocean, can you tell me where to search? Don't talk without practical knowledge. See, madam. If you need custody on the kids, one, your brother should sign or you need your brother's death certificate. Will you keep wasting your time imagining you will find the body or will you take the death certificate, leave to America and give a good future to your kids. Show the same talent in solving the case, sir. Hey, kick him out. Yes, kick me out. What else will the goons in uniform do? Hey, shut up. - Abhi, stop it. Tell me where to sign, sir. Myra, are you out of your mind? They are doing this after knowing it's a murder. Don't you understand? I understand and that is why I am asking them to close the case. For the, Please leave this to me. Who killed daddy? No one killed daddy, dear. He went to meet mom. Aunty will take better care of you. Free Telleru! Let the farmer's live! Free Telleru! Let the farmer's live! Free Telleru! Let the farmer's live! End Telleru Mafia! End Telleru Mafia! End Telleru Mafia! End Telleru Mafia! End Telleru Mafia! Hey, stop! Sir, today is Bandh. Please park the bike in the school. We will drop you in our auto. We are keeping the bike in the station and going to Delhi. Will the bike be safe for three days here? This Bandh is being conducted under environmental society, sir. Nothing will happen to your bike. Hey, you know him, right? Take the bike and park it in his house which is in the street corner. Come on, sir. Come on. Move aside. You bike will be safe. - Come on, sir. Get in, sir. 'You should follow supreme court orders!' Robbing us in the name of Bandh. [Slogans] Free ride for everyone today, sir. 'You should follow supreme court orders!' 'You should follow supreme court orders!' What kind of band is this where you don't attack police, burn down buses and close down schools? A man sent away Britishers without doing any of those, sir. It just began. Wait till afternoon. Everything will burn. Sir, police and political goons would do that, not us. We are farmers who commit suicide. Not goons who murder people. If you are farmer why are you driving an rickshaw? Because I couldn't survive as a farmer. And didn't have means to get educated. Look at the map, sir. You will understand our story. In the last three years, 900 farmers around Telleru committed suicide. It might just be another news to you. But they are not suicides, sir. Murders! This story started 40 years ago for votes. 'Once, Telluru was the biggest fresh water lake in Asia.' 'It used to help both farmers and fishermen.' 'But by encroaching Telleru,' 'and with the bait of artificial fishing ponds' 'one person turned all the fishermen as her voters' The she came up with societies, loans and leases and turned those very voters into slaves. 'She built an empire' Her name is Visakha Vani. And the name of that business is Matsyagandha Fisheries. She bought into politics with business and business into politics and she has the whole state in her grip today. But, how are farmers at loss in this? The synthetic food given to fish contaminated the water, The water level decreased because of culverts. 'The sea water kicked back' 'and hectares of farms are destroyed.' 'The lake which was once filled with oxygen' 'because poisonous today, sir.' The encroachments keep increasing without a care for supreme court. If government is acting like goons, what will the common man do, sir? Sir... I told you it's free ride. If you respond to our story, that is payment enough for us. Sir. I am sorry I was rude with you the other day. I was rude to save you from that goon. He has a shoot at sight order on him for the past six months. Even police couldn't do anything. What can you do, sir? If he is killed one more will take his place. You are a farm who should be weeding such people. Finish the interview with flying colours and have a chilled beer with Auto Mani, sir. I will remember you till I die. All the best, sir. - Thank you. All the best. Why are you anxious every time you sit in a train? You will have panic attacks but still want to go in the train. Memories define a person. You should face them, not run away from them. Whatever, dude. Look at that. Hey, it's Auto Mani. - Yes. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it! Hey! Hey! Hey! No! 'What is the importance of Eluru in history?' 'Vengi kings have ruled it for 10 decades.' 'Can you name a tourist attraction of your place?' 'Telleru.' Everyone feels IAS officers are corrupt. What is your opinion about that? When the foundation itself is corrupt, everyone is corrupt, sir. With all due respect, is anyone among you not corrupt? What is your opinion about the rapist's encounter in Hyderabad? Brutal. How? Justice serves all equally. Our justice system has been failing people with delay, bias and neglect. That encounter is a temporary solution for that impertinence chosen by politics. If one of those rapists was son of a minister, would that encounter have happened, sir? Mr. Abhiram, in a village in your purview a interfaith couple is being hung by villagers for marrying. In another village, an acid attack is taking place on a girl. Which village would you chose to go? Whichever village is closer, I will go there, sir. What's the point of this question, sir? Which two is important in 22, and which came first, chicken or egg,... When any answer is the right answer, how will it be a personality interview, sir? Or are you teaching me there is nothing right and nothing wrong before entering the system? Mr. Abhiram, are you challenging the integrity of this board? No, sir. I am challenging the integrity of the entire system, sir. How will fit in that system with this kind of attitude? Where is the system for me to fit in, sir? Politicians, government officers, courts, these three horses are pulling the constitution equally, and move forward condemning each other's errors, is when the cart will be in motion. But this arrogant political horse, not only went off track, but also pulling the other two horses with it. Where is the system now, sir? We filter millions of people and push all the valuable brains into the system. But where do they have the chance to work with honestly, sir? If this personality interview, how will this personality go missing there, sir? 'The goons who have no right to wander about in the society.' 'are killing innocent people in broad day light.' The systems which are supposed to control them are supporting them. I came to this interview while watching such incidents, sir. Who gave that power to them, sir? A voter waiting for their elected politician to change his life, A politician controlling bureaucrats while robbing the economy, A bureaucrat working for influential and failing to work for people A voter stuck in this trap and gave up on his life and selling his vote. It's a vicious circle, sir. How does it matter if another IAS officer come and goes? How does it matter if it's me or someone else? We are living in a hallucination of government for 75 years, sir. And we still don't know how the government is. What's the point of this interview, sir? If not a pseudo intellectual masturbation. Mr. Abhiram, you are unfit for this field with this temperament. Sorry. Thank you, sir. I realized that. I entered this game because of an ego clash with a civil servant. But on the way here, I understood, there are no rules in this game, and this is not a game but a hunt. I am sorry, uncle. These research reports are compiled by my brother, uncle. I found them while vacating. I definitely feel it's a political murder. I wish I could help. If the system doesn't respond, what can I do alone, dear? I will report to WHO as soon as I get to US. Will you help me to reopen this case, uncle? Hey, uncle is home. Are you IAS now? What happened to the interview? What will happen? It happened as you wished, uncle He screwed the interview. You can go book the US tickets. I will book business class this time. This is Connecticut number. Let me know when you are there. I will come and pick you up. Abhi! A person like you if more useful to the country than being in the system. Just take it easy, Abhi. Hope to see you soon. Bye, aunty. Bye, uncle. Bye, Priya. - Bye, uncle. You should stay with us when you come to US. Bye. Out. come give the bat. You said out right? Yes, I caught it. You didn't say that. Hey, he is already a corruption king. Give the bat here. I won't. - Leave the bat. Leave me. - Hey! Abhiram, resident of Eluru, completed his Mechanical Engineering in IIT, and was a gold medallist. He was in news during last election questioning the election system. Now, in his first attempt, cracked UPSC and topped it too. It is understood that cabinet secretary and few of the panellists are impressed with his interview. 'Even though he got through MIT in US...' See, any new medicine or vaccine, will enter the market only when the sample is success. If we apply the same tactic in public administration is when we will get a matured democracy. Since I was a cabinet secretary, I always argued that any policy should go through a brick level experiment before implementing it country wide. Mr. Abhi, you are that experiment. Along with producing collectors in future, UPSC will also take over the authority on them from state government. Central government has introduced executive amendment bill for this. Don't think you will have unlimited powers because I am calling it an experiment. No politician will have the authority to transfer you. This is the only comfort you have. As a first experiment on this proposal, IAS topper Abhiram was designated by UPSC as the collector of West Godavari district. 'The future of this bill is dependent' 'on the performance of this 25 year old bachelor.' "Compromise" This is another proof of central government's monarchy. It is anti-federal and we are strongly opposing this bill. It's ridiculous and undemocratic. All the local parties in the country, are condemning and opposing this bill. All the democratic countries in the world, work in the same model. This is the real democracy. With the support of the current central government, our target is to achieve that. And mark my words, this experiment will be a failure. "He's the soldier!" "Soldier" "Soldier" "He's an experiment." "Live to lead" "He is the soldier." "Soldier" Collector! Down down! Collector! Down down! Collector! Down down! Collector! Down down! "Soldier" Collector! Down down! Good morning Sir, Collector! Down down! Collector! Down down! Collector! Down down! they come to know you are coming so they started today morning Collector down down Collector down down I didn't ask about that rowdies which were send by politicians, I am asking about these "Deeksha" Collector down down It's been 2 weeks Sir, Day by day we are taking person to person to hospital but another person taking his place Without demands fulfil they won't take off that tent Give me a order Sir, I will clean them If we do like that, there is no difference between us and Britisher Collector down down We are here to solve the people's problem not to do settlements. Not here, look at there "He is the solider" "Soldier" "Soldier" Please be seated till now, District Collector life was in Politician hands from today onwards it will be in UPSC board hands. It means, indirectly all your life is based in my hands. As you all know, Collector is the supreme authority of the District and I am that supreme authority there is the only one difference in old way and new way earlier the settlement was done in Politician house secretly from today onwards it will happen here legally, Publicly, Peace full. It's not a movie, to change the system in fraction I am not a hero in "Bharathiyudu" movie, not even hero in "Aparichitudu" movie By choice no one can change the person who are corrupted we have to punish them according to the law. There are lots of old-fashioned officers working in the system. From them I want to give a chance that is the real change. whoever taking this as take it easy, that every new candidate will talk like this Please request for the transfer, otherwise, it will spoil your career its my guaranty SP Sir. - Sir Come to my room with the case file of Guna 14 murder, 4 rapes, total 18 convention. Shoot at sight order given 6 months ago, How do you explain this? - Sir. We are searching for him with special team since 6 months How long you are working as SI? Three Months Sir. What is shoot at sight order means? The criminal who has to be in jail, he is out, and doing harm for the people, Court has given order that to shoot him on the sight. He is roaming outside freely Do you have any disease like selective vision On the day of your coming, without my permission you called my staff and insulting in front of them Lets talk directly. If we touch the Guna it means we directly declaring the war with Vishakha Vani. If we kill Guna, the person will killed Guna will also die. Everyone knows this, in this city. who will save us from that transfer Sir? Including this job, we have responsibility of our family too. SP Sir, Please talk to IG and request him for your transfer to other district, and fulfil your responsibility of your family. Disbursed. Sir, I know where Guna live. If you support me, I will dare to do it Sir. whoever kill the Guna will die right, Let's go and say hi to death. Sudhakar, Department people called me and they said, two dogs are coming to kill you then what about rest of the dog till now whoever come, didn't you tell them what happened to them? What they said for that? - What we have to say brother? Let it be happen whatever you want. 2 person and 2 guns, Hey, go. Come on. Please leave me, sir. I beg you. Please leave me, sir. You said one thing correctly. No, sir. Life is delicate. It will go away in a second. Yours as well as mine. [Indistinct chatter] Sir. Myra. Myra. Two children should be with her. Go and check. - Yes, sir. Myra. Myra, Myra. Myra. Myra. Doctor! Doctor! It is found that the girl who has been rescued from detention is an NRI. As per news, today at 3 a.m., encounter operation had been completed in the area. This kidnap had taken place to the victim while returning to America again. This case which had been going on for years is the main cause for 18 other cases. The very day collector Abhiram had come... Collector Abhiram has given 48 hours of time for all the goons of the district to be silent. She had multiple fractures and needed about 14 stitches on the head, but she is lucky. She will survive. But she was brutally tortured and repeatedly raped. How is she, sir? She will survive. Any information about the children? They have killed them, sir. Why they killed, where they have thrown the bodies, even they don't know, sir. These murderers, let's kill them here, sir, encounter... Sudhakar. today there is justice in our anger. We will kill. Tomorrow in another case, people like the SP will unnecessarily kill the innocent in the name of encounter to free the real culprits. Can you stop it? Can you stop it? Every time when some injustice happens, if people, police, and media take law in their hand themselves, it will not be called as system. The difference between killing an accused like Guna with court order and killing him without taking him to the court is called the system. Present the accused in the court before the public forget them, make sure they get punished. Whatever more we do, there is no difference between them and us. CM has arrived. Over. Madam, madam, madam [Indistinct news reporter voice] Madam please listen... Good day, madam. Good day, sir. Good day. - Will she survive? There is no threat to life. At present, she is unconscious. Who is handling the case? Collector sir is directly handling it. Let the concerned person do the duty. Okay, sir. Gopal. - Yes, sir. You stay here and do the needful. Okay, madam. Instead of solving the problem, he has increased it. Idiotic fellow. With this encounter, collector Abhiram and you... Madam, everyone is saying that Guna is your person, what's your say on this? At first, I pray God that the victim gets well soon. I request the law to severely punish all the accused who were caught during this incident. Opposition party had campaigned that our party had created and encouraged Guna. What they could not do in six months, we did it in six weeks and showed them. From this, you yourself decide who encouraged Guna. Sir, you severely opposed the appointment of collector Abhiram, but outside everyone think that it was he who took charge and executed this operation. What are your thoughts on this? - Who said that? This was a secret operation planned the day our government came to existence. And collector Abhiram is just a passing point in our chain of command. That's it. Our party's goal is to put an end to all the goons in the state. We started it with this encounter. For the betterment of our state, we will do such strategic state plans. Madam, madam, what is the girl's condition, madam? Nothing regarding the girl is being said, why? - Sir, you tell, sir. Did you see that girl? How is the girl's condition? That girl's condition is very hopeless. We cannot do anything other than praying that she should recover. You have seen how the results will be if political leaders give freedom to our department. We hope that we get the same type of support in the future. Related to the encounter... You take care. Sir, sir. Just one minute, sir. CM sir has asked me to personally handle this case, sir. Did he ask me not to come? - No, nothing like that, sir. He said the concerned person should do his work, sir. As a collector, I have the authority to directly handle any work with anyone in the district. Of course, sir. You are the absolute authority. Who are they, sir? If crime happens to the US citizens in any part of the world, it becomes our duty to help the consular assistants. Our duty is to support them, any concerns? Not at all, sir. No problem, sir. No problem. Is this the medicine going in there? - Yes ma'am. Can I check? This is a wrong dosage. Who gave the prescription? Chief doctor gave, ma'am. What's happening here? Is the treatment going on to kill the patient? Mind your language, sir. Actually, who are they all? Consulate officials. You have given 30% xylitol in hypotonic saline. Don't you know the lungs will freeze and the patient will die? It's you who wrote it, right? Sir, a mistake would have happened, sir. Take it away, take it. Please get it yourself. Taking a human's life is not a mistake. Come outside. Sir. I can understand what is happening here. You go and take care of the other patients. Who are you? What are you doing here? I am Vishaka Vani madam's PA. She asked me to be here and take care of the girl's progress. Progress? Let's see. She is conscious now. We will shift here to Hyderabad and then pick from there. We will move to the US. - No, no, no, no. First we have to file the FIR. Impossible. - What? What? She doesn't want to meet any police. How is it possible, madam? FIR has to be filed, it's procedure, protocol. - Sir, I know her, please let me talk. Excuse me, sir. You can't go inside. I am her close friend, please let me in. No. Sorry, sir. You can't go in. Myra, Myra, Myra. - You can't go inside. Myra, Myra. - You're not allowed. I'm sorry, sir. She is calling. Let me go inside. What the hell, man? Hello. - Madam, situation seems to have gone out of hand. He has gone inside. They took me too to kill the way they killed others. I am a girl, right? They decided how to kill me. To control me, in front of my eyes, the children were... Today's breaking news is the rape victim, Myra Hansen who is getting treatment in Mamta Hospital is said to be recovering as informed by reporters. Please watch our channel to get health updates on Myra Hansen. Myra, tell me just one thing. Whom did you meet last with those documents? Immediately after I reach US, I will report to WH. Will you help me to reopen the case alone from here, uncle? Sir, it is said that this is a rape. How did that rape happen? How many people raped, sir? - Can it be considered gang rape? Is this really a rape? Do you think this is Worser than Nirbhaya rape? Please let us know, sir. Tell, sir. Yes. This is the worst rape in the country. This is not just a rape that happened to a girl but that has been happening daily to some girl or the other for 75 years. A rape that has been happening to the nature, seasons and life. Victim is not one in this rape. You people who are holding mic and camera, every single person who is listening and seeing. It's not four who should be punished for this rape, there's a whole empire in this. 'This is my wife Radhika.' 'She had been suffering from an incurable' 'nervous disorder for the past six months.' 'Today her heart stopped.' 'The heart which was beating' 'for me and my children.' 'I am working as a doctor and professor in Asram Medical College.' 'While studying in college, Radhika and I loved and got married.' 'From the time I started practising,' 'I had been handling some neurological disorder cases' 'which no one could understand.' 'Every month, the patients' count kept increasing.' '3000 cases have already been registered in the district.' 'Only when my wife became sick with this disease,' 'I got a clue about it.' 'All the patients who got this disease have a common habit,' 'eating fish daily.' 'That fish grows in Thelleru' 'which is distributed through Matsyagandha Fisheries.' 'In Thelleru, 80% fish tanks are at lease in Matsyagandha Fisheries.' 'The waste from the meat shops and dead animals are mixed' 'to a chemical and used as food for the fishes.' 'This is done for the fishes to grow quickly and earn more profit.' 'For the past 30 years, the fishes are grown this way in this pond.' 'Because of this, whole of Thelleru is' 'filled with a bacteria called sea lice.' 'This bacteria is inside every single fish that is growing in the pond.' 'To a great extent, this bacteria dies before we eat.' 'But in some rare cases, it is still alive.' 'It directly attacks the brain.' 'This bacteria is in the blood of every patient who has this disease.' 'When the quantity of birds reduced, no one cared as it were just birds.' 'How can a pond which could not keep a bird alive allow humans to live?' 'The reason for the surrounding lakhs of acres of land to be spoilt' 'and farmers' suicidal deaths are caused due to this pollution.' 'Only for namesake it is good water Sarasu,' 'but this water is useless for drinking and using.' 'When such things influence the surrounding lakhs of lives,' 'to neglect and sit is equivalent to genocide.' He left US citizenship at the age of 18, studied in India and settled here. With these reports to take action, he met our officials to get this sorted out who claim to shoulder all the responsibilities of India, this half-Indian Varun Hansen. After meeting our DC, he went missing. After meeting the same DC, his sister Myra Hansen who is now being treated, in the hospital, she also went missing. Sir, I did my duty. I informed the higher officials. You are not a postman, Mr. Dasarath! You are not a postman. Is this the response you give as a DC to as person? Sir, the public health officer has given a counter report that it is baseless and a wrong research, sir. Sir, it was DC sir who asked me to fake the report. I was also asked to do it by my higher officials, sir. As of now, you both are suspended and are under investigation. Sir, sir. Please tell me sir. In Niche world Darwin, Bapu and Haldankar? Wait inside, sir. In Niche world Darwin, Bapu and Haldankar? One is a gift given by Bapu sir to my dad. The other one is a gift given to me by my father. Other than that, in my world, it doesn't have more value. Please. Tell me. How did you give birth to so many deaths being a mother? Have you come here to talk philosophy or talk about some problem? I have come to ask you to give back life to Thelleru which you had taken. Taken? But once it is dead, it won't come back again, right? If you open your hand and leave it, Thelleru will come back to life. That's the power of nature. 250000 people live in Thelleru, then what about their lives? This proposal is regarding how they will survive. It didn't happen during opposition government. Do you think it will happen now? Then, is it wrong on my part to take action as an executive? No other go, madam. As per constitution, you seem to have forgotten that the salaried need to work as per the order of the legislature. As per the constitution, if something wrong happens, the salaried need not follow as per the legislative assembly. If you follow, people like you will become Hitler. Hitler or Gandhi, they became leaders only because of the public, collector. That public is behind me. When they get to know about death and life, they would choose life, madam, not you. Listen, I will tell you a bird story. It is the story of a freedom fighter who first started a co-op society in the state. He taught people that democracy lies with the local governance. To make their lives better, he held a communist flag in the shoulder and left. After listening to everything, just before the elections, for the sake of money from the opponents, defeated him in such a way that he didn't even get his deposit, the same people. Opposing the emergency, he lost his son-in-law in a police fight. He spent 13 months in jail and died without anyone in a pathetic way. That person's name is Hanumantha Rao. His daughter's name is Vishaka Vani. She was pregnant when she performed her father's last rites. That day, she didn't perform just her father's last rites, but also the values which her father taught. Keeping that fire in her heart, she owned the trick which defeated her father and she lives today keeping that winning streak until this day. You mean the trick is to keep cheating the people and living? A cartoonist who got angry on a Tamil editor for not printing his useless cartoons sent the South Indians from Mumbai and became a political leader. Later he sent the North Indians out for some years and became a powerful person. That fascist family is the ruling party now in that state. Every person who in the name of caste separates the country and creates issues is a leader. Every party who in the name of subsidy makes a person lazy is a ruling party. You tend to get cheated where ignorance plays a vital role, collector. Those idiots won't understand even if you tell them what is death and what is life. Your eyes are seeing the spoilt pond. My eyes are seeing the spoilt sea. As Darwin said, man evolved from monkey. In any democracy, at any given point of time, 80% of the voters are still monkeys. But there is only one power for the intelligent minority and the foolish monkeys... Vote. What will come out of such intelligence except anarchy? Whoever achieves in making the monkey play, only they will be on the pyramid and that's how any democracy functions, my son. For the issue that you brought here, my equation is simple. The number of voters who are affected by the pond is one lakh and benefited by the same is two and a half lakhs. That calculation is my decision and it is purely democratic. You have missed a simple logic in the whole theory, madam. A human has evolved from this end to that end, correct. But for evolution, there is a power, conscience. Conscience. Today I am questioning in front of you because of conscience. I will give you one week time to change from this version to the next version. By this time, if you get light within, we will walk together. If not, you will fall from above and be badly injured, like Hitler. And by the way, my philosophy is also what you studied, what Darwin niche taught. but in it you are seeing the magnitude and I am seeing the change. Thanks for your time, madam. To wipe the provincial party one by one, one of the plans of the central government is the new collector. He is sacrificing you people in this process. He wants to involve me in this scam and you will be the ultimate sufferers. From this moment, Matsyagandha Fisheries is not mine, it's yours. Hey. In this company, every single Matsyagandha worker is an equal shareholder. Long live Vishaka Vani, Long live Vishaka Vani. Long live Vishaka Vani, Long live Vishaka Vani. I came here knowing that you will react in this way because this pond is yours but is this pond still yours? This pond was yours till 40 years back, but the time you leased the pond which was full of life, that very day it had gone out of your hand. Okay, what did you achieve by doing this? Four people are sharing that one should be getting and you yourselves are interfering with your development. You are sharing the same inefficiency of your life to your children by making them lie down here. If we put an end to this, you will not be the end sufferers but those who are earning 10 times more than you people, these society presidents and those who are earning 1000 times more than you people and sitting in a throne on your future who is that dictator. Your fear, lack of knowledge, innocence and faith are the four legs of that throne. To protect her throne and to cover her crimes, she has made you people shareholders too in that company but the truth is that you will never get your share. You know what is happening in this pond, you know that it is wrong, but you are scared to come out and have a look at it. Why are you scared? For immigration or for your safety? 100 years back, to protect this fish empire, your fathers and grandfathers had come from Orissa as immigrants who were the heroes back then. They were not scared of immigration and change like you people. Get rid of that fear at least once, this throne will break and this pond will be freed from dirt. This pond will give life to you and give life to the farmers as well. You have the skill to catch fishes by yourself and even your children can move forward in life as per their skills in the future. I haven't come only for this pond but also to free you and your children's future from this hell. It's your choice to either object or give way, but I will not move one step or break any one of these without your permission. Hey collector, how much did you take from him? He wants to grab this pond from us and give it to them. You selfish people, how dare you try to do that? Come, let's see. Hey, you all come, let's finish them off. Stop, stop. Charge, hit them. Spot jump. Battalion, take position. Fire. No! Don't fire. Hold it. No. What happened? 'In this accident, a total of 17 died and 22 were hurt.' 'On the basis of safety precautions, Thelleru village'' 'and the neighbouring areas have been imposed with 144 section.' 'UPSC board has suspended collector Abhiram.' 'Due to this incident, central government's antithesis ' 'has completely changed now to separate ' 'executive branch from legislative control.' 'Many leaders from the political party criticized collector' 'Abhiram for being an irresponsible person during this mishap' 'and creating ruckus in their lives.' 'I had predicted earlier that collector Abhiram would fail.' 'He is a failed experiment.' 'Central government has arranged for a tribunal in the' 'supreme court regarding this incident.' 'Collector Abhiram's father is' 'also involved in covering up the Thelleru scam.' 'We should wait and see what judgment' 'will be given by this tribunal court.' Hello. Are you angry, son? But I personally pity you. When I see you, I feel like my dead father has returned. Where is the result that you are searching for from the people, tell me? Nobody in the country is thinking about health, education, agriculture, environment, and economy, son. Their thoughts are only about caste, religion and day-to-day needs. Neither do they have the intent to change nor do we intend to change them. Do you know why I didn't react when you killed Guna? It's because there are thousands of Guna in that region. Since it is a first failure, it will be very painful. You will slowly get used to it. Every failure brings us closer to reality and blends us with the system. Hello sister. Abhi, father hasn't come home, I am scared. Some farmers from Kaikalur came, he went along with them. Don't be worried, I am going. Abhi, what's happening? Myra, lock the door. Don't allow anyone. Abhi. Don't spare him. Come on. Because of you, our lives are at stake. You spoiled our lives. [Indistinct crowd voice] Stop the tractor. Get down. I won't do the mistake of taking a bribe. I won't ask for bribe for doing the right thing. There's a chance they might come up with a stay order at any time. Let's speed up. Make sure all the explosives are properly accounted. None of the buildings around should be affected, okay? Zero tolerance. - There won't be any problem, sir. I will check everything. - Okay. Dad, will all the buildings crash at the same time like world trade Center? Yes. How will it crash at the same time? Because we explode the dynamites at the same time. How many dynamites have you placed? What is going on? We had sent you a notice, but you kept on constructing. We have to bring it down, sir. Stop it. Do you know with whom you are speaking, Rahul Sengupta? Chief minister's brother-in-law. The biggest builder in the city. I know, sir. Then, what is the problem? What do you want? I just want the building to come down, sir. But it is a completed building But constructed illegally in a public park. Listen. I will give you 10 flats in that building. I won't do the mistake of taking a bribe. I won't ask for bribe for doing the right thing. You happy? Are you happy? Ready sir. On count three. No. All set. One. - Don't do so. Two. - Dasarath. Three. Careful. What is it? Transfer again? What else will it be, then? [Regional language] [Regional language] [Regional language] Checkmate. No, I will not move this. I didn't see, dad. Hey, if you do a mistake in a game, you should correct and not repeat it. It teaches character. If you want to win, play another game. Come on. Popcorn, popcorn. Popcorn, popcorn. [Regional language] [Regional language] Let us shift to a compartment that has a curtain, dear. [Regional language] Excuse me. - Yes. Can you lower your voice and take the drink near the door? [Regional language] No! Dad, dad. Leave my father. Dear. This is a gift from Rahul Sengupta. The system expels those who do not mingle with the system. He did not want to kill you. He only wanted to break you. Now you are broke and you will stay broke. I am sorry, Mr. Dasarath. On that day, you lost your daughter and wife in the train. In the same train, I lost my father as well along with my mother and sister. I came to this game with a hope that I will get my father, Mr. Dasarath. I came to remind you who you are. I lost. My intention was never to disrespect you, Mr. Dasarath. I am sorry. I am extremely sorry. You think I lost because a goon killed my wife and daughter? Such goons are all around the world, son. But the difference is if the system would encourage or punish them. I did not lose in that train. It was the moment those culprits got out of jail in two months innocent people though there were 60 people as witnesses for killing two in that courtroom. The moment when Rahul Sengupta looked into my eyes when the judgment was given. From that day, I digested the truth of that smile every day and killed my true self and lived. This is a procession for the dead bodies of that day, son. This garland is not put by you. This dead body should be buried and not live with such a life, dear. I knew that you would be broken into pieces like me if you come this way, but today I cannot see the reality in your face, dear. Only the one who runs away from the battle is a loser. The one who fights till the end is a hero. My son hasn't lost and should not lose. Tell me how this dead body can be of help for him to win. Dad, will you again become the light to show me the way, dad? 13 years ago, I came out from West Bengal Board and wrote APPSC exam. I got posted as public health officer in Eluru. During the first inspection, I got to know that a bacteria named sea lice is present in Tillite. I immediately consulted with responsible officers and in order to take action, I reported to the then collector late Mr. Raj Sinha. As it was worth thousand crores of business run by minister Vishaka Vani and life giving opportunity for two and a half lakh voters, my proposal was rejected. I was threatened to fake the inspection reports, if not to be transferred elsewhere. Even if I don't do that work, they will get it done through somebody else, so I myself did it. I was immediately promoted as district development officer. Four years back, when the farmers came to tell me that the lands were getting destroyed due to the pond, I thought of taking action at least then. I met and submitted another report directly to the Minister of Fisheries, Mrs. Vishaka Vani ma'am. Because the fisheries vote was more than that of the farmers and Tillite issue would create unnecessary problems, reports were asked to be faked. After Varun Hansen's reports, I met previous collector Vijay Kumar sir and requested him to take action. Because Vishaka Vani would win the elections and it was not advisable to oppose her in any way, reports were asked to be faked. Even if I don't do that work, they will get it done through somebody else, so I myself did it. Witness is excused. Public Health officer, Mr. Ranganath. I plead not guilty, your honour. I faked the inspection reports under the instructions of deputy collector Dasarath sir. Even if I don't do that work, they will get it done through somebody else, so I myself did it. Now forest officer, Mr. Janardhan Rao. Pleading not guilty, your honour. I simply followed DC sir's instructions, that's all. Even if I don't do that work, they will get it done through somebody else, so I myself did it. Witness is excused. Ex-collector, Mr. Vijaya Kumar. Pleading not guilty, your honour. I didn't get to see any of Dasarath sir's reports. I have never instructed my subordinates to fake the reports. Vishaka Vani madam never interfered in this issue. Mrs. Vishaka Vani. I plead not guilty, your honour. Neither have I influenced any of these officers nor are there witnesses for having done so. Father and son are playing the blame game against me to cover up their faults that they have done together. For the past 40 years, I have been living for the people and fighting for the people. Instead of wasting my precious time on this collector sir's allegations, I request the court to severely punish DC sir who has been plotting the whole scam. The court is recessed for lunch. I wonder if we will get justice. She till yesterday was complaining against the central government but now she has joined with them. How come the alliances keep changing here as per their needs? Because all the parties' agenda is the same. It seems like it is Delhi party's game to bring her into their party. Experimental collector is just bullshit. You are just a pawn in that chess board. Yes, sir. - Did you see the news? Yeah, I just read it, sir. So you know which way to go? Of course yes, sir. - Good. Who is it, sir? Home minister. What will happen now? What will happen? The pawns who confessed will go to jail. Players will go out and play another game. Mr. Abhiram, you are closing the argument. Your honour, this case is not about a person, a class or about the spoilt Tillite. We are this pond and this pond is our system. The violence that happened this month on 9th is not one that happened in the heat of the argument. The land surveys, inspection reports, forgery of health records, threatening the officers who point out, killing those who oppose, creating differences between the farmers and the fishermen, these situations are all created by Mrs. Vishaka Vani. All the details with evidences are kept in front of you, but this investigation is not a war between that truth and this lie, it's a war between truth and justice. The person who was responsible for so many deaths, in order to escape from this crime crime has joined hands with the central government. Celebration there and here murder of truth. Your honour, democracy means right to vote and right to talk, that's what we think, but because of the wrong system that is going out of hand day by day, we are forced to live in a feudal way rather than a democratic one. Not just the public, civil servants and the court too live as a pawn to those rulers. A President in America was brought down for secretly listening to the Opposition party election strategy. But here in Uttar Pradesh, an MLA attended the assembly for two years who had repeatedly beaten a girl and murdered his family members. That's the difference between democracy and feudalism. If police become the system and start doing the encounters, the whole nation is appreciating, your honour. Isn't it an insult to the judicial system? Politicians like Vishaka Vani have become the law, justice and judgment so much so they free their favourite accused and punish the innocent whom they hate. If judicial system doesn't open its eyes even now, will it ever open? If the legislator whom the public trust, the civil servant who enforces the legislation and the judiciary which gives justice, only if these three horses work together, it becomes democracy, it becomes government. This executive system is questioning the legislative horse which has gone astray in the wrong path. Only if the judiciary system takes a stand and gets hold of the horses, this is a real Republic. From the judgment that you are going to give, you should search for an answer for just one question, your honour. From the day Thelleru had been infected, 133 society members have been missing like Varun Hansen. Hundreds of farmers committed suicide. Thousands of consumers have got a disease. Who are responsible for their deaths? Who are those people who are behind Thelleru becoming poison? How much more life is to be given to Thelleru which still has life? Who are those responsible for the deaths of the people? Last but not the least, who has been benefited for the last 40 years by this scam? A judgment which cannot save nature, life and society and a judgment which cannot punish the real culprit who had taken so many lives is not a judgment. It is equivalent to the Thelleru which is poisoned. I rest my case, your honour. Sir, sir. We completely believe the evidences that collector Abhiram has submitted about Varun Hansen's thelleru. Order, order, order. Order, order, order. Under supreme court's order, not just fifth contour till 9th contour, if needed by taking RBI's help too, Order, order. Order, order. Order, order. Sit, sit. As a public representative, Mrs. Vishaka Vani who has benefited maximum by this Thelleru issue is considered the primary culprit. Hey Narasimham. - Order, order. What judgment is this? Also deputy collector Dasarath, ex-collector Vijay Kumar, forest officer Janardhan Rao, health officer Ranganathan, under section 299, 300... - This is nonsense. ...304 A, 171 E - Who made you sit there? will be given life sentence. Order, order. I, hereby, direct the police to take the conviction to their custody. I will change your judgment in a week, you see. The court is adjourned. How dare you? What nonsense is this? Narasimham! Leave, leave me. Narasimham, what are you doing? Have you gone mad? I am sorry, dad. This is not my arrest, dear. Leave me. My freedom. Leave me. Leave me alone! You think you won? Do you think you won? I will change this judgment in the supreme court in a week and show. One week's time, I will change the verdict. I will change the verdict in a week. Leave me. I will kill you if you hold me. Madam, madam. Hold her. Move, move. Hold her. - Take her, come. Constables, take her, come. - Please move, move. You are not my enemy and I am not your enemy. The system which had taken away my father and your father is the enemy. This victory is over that system. This is also yours. Wishing you well, madam. System won't change so easily, son. This system will never change, son. After some days... Stop. Go there. Hey! Who are you? What are you doing here? Hey, who are you? Stop. Why are you building those logs in the lake? Tell me, who sent you? Who sent you here? Hey, stop. Who built those logs in the lake? Tell me, who built those logs in the lake? Didn't you all ask that to be removed quoting farmer's issues and other issues? Now you yourself are building logs on that lake. Hello, MLA here. So, so what? Tell, why are you scared? We built it. What's wrong in it? Your caste people earned in crores using the lake for the past 40 years. Even we will do it for 40 years and then talk about this, what do you say? My caste? My caste? What is my caste? Tell me, what is my caste? Tell me. Come on tell me. What is my cast? Tell me. Come on. - Leave... Leave, leave, leave. Aren't you ashamed? What are you talking and with whom? Are you eating food for your stomach or grass? Sir, you go sir, I will look into it. Tomorrow morning I will make sure it is removed, sir. You go, sir. You go. "You are the one, I want." "What mischievous talks you do always." "Closing the eyes, talking to me." "Closing the eyes, talking to me." "Dreams are important to live in one's life." "Don't trust anyone except me." "I am the only one you can hold on to." Uncle. Forgive me, sir. We will search every inch in Thelleru and in the sea and find out collector Abhiram's body. "He is not in darkness." "He will not come in the morning." "In your dream" in my dream." "In our dreams, he lives like always and I cherish every moment of it." "He is an evidence for truth."
