Mommy? Mommy? No! Mommy? Matthew! Sophie! No! Don't look! Don't look! Close your eyes! Hello? No, no, I'm fine. I'm just... I'm just running. Okay. Okay, I'm on my way. The first diagnosis is a delusional disorder. If a subject believes something to be real, whether imagined or not, the delusion exists and should be treated as real. This is the first step in a successful diagnosis. What do you wanna do? You with the crime scene? Dr. Fuller, psychologist. - Dr. Fuller? - Uh-huh. Helena Wynsfield. Murdered her husband. We just need to evaluate her state of mind. Should be easy, even for a rookie. Matthew Wynsfield, 43. Why are you showing me this? Because before you make the call whether Mrs. Wynsfield is going to the court or the nut house, you need to understand the reality of what we're dealing with. What you got? I don't know. Taka... Takahas? Mrs. Wynsfield? Can you hear me? - Where is the daughter? - Upstairs with her grandpa. She's not talkin', either. Come in. Hello. Is Sophie here? She's under the bed. Shouldn't you be out looking for the real killer? - Excuse me? - He's a drug addict. His name's Dougie. I saw Helena and Matthew with him last week. Please, sir, I just need a couple of minutes. Sophie? Would you like to come out and chat? Okay, I'm coming in. Oh, and who is this fine-looking gentleman? Mr. Fluffy Jojo. Well, hello! It's so lovely to meet you. I'd love a picture for my wall. How about you draw Mr. Fluffy for me? When I was a little girl, I used to have a hideout just like this. A place where no one could find me. I'd go there when I wanted to be alone, when I felt a little sad because... my mommy was so sick. Just like your mommy. Grandpa said if I talk to you, you'll take Mommy away. Well, Grandpa is right to be worried. We're all worried. Did your mommy have to go away? Yes. She had to go into the hospital. - Forever? - Just until she got better. Did she get better? Yes, she got better. And I want your mommy to get better, too. You have to be brave and... tell me anything that you remember from last night. If I tell, promise you won't take Mommy away? I promise. I heard scary noises. I went to see what was happening, and... And... What did you see? Sophie? Who hurt Daddy? Mara. Mrs. Wynsfield? Helena? I just spoke to Sophie. Who's Mara? Matthew was barely sleeping. He was losing his mind. And he broke down and he-- he said he had a confession, and he-- It's okay, Helena. Take your time. He'd said he'd cheated on me, - with a student. - We got a motive. Ten years of marriage just gone. I said I wanted a divorce. He begged me, he begged me to forgive him, but I just, I couldn't! Not even for Sophie. And then every time I looked at her, I just... I felt so guilty. And now he's dead. What happened last night, Helena? Uh... um... I-- I woke up... completely paralyzed. I was pressed down into the mattress. There was something evil in the room. And then I... I heard this awful music. And then I saw it. Her. As real as you're sitting there. The sleep demon. Mara. And there was nothing I could do. She climbed up on, onto his chest and... I know how this sounds! But I... I swear. I swear on my daughter's life I did not kill my husband. Oh, she's gone. Certifiable froot-loop. Uh, get me your evaluation by tomorrow morning. Then, we can mop this thing up. Sophie just lost her dad. I need to be sure before I commit her mom. Are you kidding me? We got two options here. Now, either Mrs. Wynsfield is insane and a danger to the public, or she's telling the truth, and a demon killed her husband. Now, which one sounds more plausible to you, Dr. Fuller? Hmm? Certifiable froot-loops! I'm sorry, Sophie. - I love you, Mommy. - I love you, too. And what did Grandpa give you for breakfast? Huh? Pancakes... with sugar and chocolate. - Sugar and chocolate? - Mm-hmm. That is naughty. That is not good. And you got your little pizza in? Mm-hmm. Hopefully, we can have pizza for dinner. Did you brush your teeth? Good girl. Oh, could you give her a little more time, please? She's with her daughter. No can do. Running late. I gotta get home. Mrs. Wynsfield, I'm sorry, but time is up. Can you come with me? Please come with me. - What is this? No! Get off of me! No! - Please. Please! - Mommy! - I'm innocent! I'm innocent! I didn't do anything! - Let go! Let go! - Mommy! - Help me! Help me! - Mommy! - No! - Mom! - Mommy! - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. - Mommy! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - You promised! You promised! - I'm sorry. You promised! Mommy! Mommy! The commerce department said new home sales increased 3. 1% for seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units last month, pulling them close to a nine-year high since July. "Takahashi knows more. 1966 Grange Avenue." Hello? Mr. Takahashi? Hello? Mr. Takahashi? Mr. Takahashi? - Who was he? - Don't know. Not a registered US citizen. These injuries match those of the Wynsfield murder. Whoa, whoa. Now, there are similarities, granted, but nothing solid enough to suggest the same killer. - What about the picture? - This guy died over a week ago. Now, what's to say Helena didn't kill them both? What? There's no way Helena did this! Twisted a guy's head around? What about this Dougie character? - We need to question him-- - We? Let me remind you of our roles here, Dr. Fuller. You're the psychologist. I'm the detective. I do the detective work, plain and simple. - But I have to put this right-- - Thank you, Dr. Fuller. Hello, Helena. Helena, do you know a Hideo Takahashi? Your father told me about someone called Dougie. A drug addict? Look... when I was around Sophie's age, my mom started acting strange. She thought the TV was talking to her, and the government was spying on her. She went out and bought this cheap plastic ornament, a Chinese beckoning cat. And she really... really believed it would protect her. It didn't. Around six months later, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My dad couldn't cope. He had her committed. And three weeks later, she hung herself. All I have left of her is that stupid cat. My mom is the reason I became a psychologist. I know what Sophie's going through. I made a mistake, Helena, and I want to fix it. Please help me make it right. Matthew... always had a sleep problem. I wanted to help him, so I... I found a... support group for sufferers in the city, run by a Dr. Ellis. Like a... an Alcoholics Anonymous for people who suffer sleep paralysis. Is that where you met Takahashi and Dougie? Meeting other sufferers really helped Matthew. He came home, he was... he was feeling much better. But that night, he... he woke up paralyzed. A red mark in his eye. Things took a turn for the worse. He saw her. It's okay. Please, let me go home and see Sophie. Please. I promise you. - We will find Matthew's killer. - I told you! My husband was killed by a sleep demon! - Helena. Helena, listen to yourself-- - Look! She's marked me! She's pure evil, and she's coming for me! And if you don't get me out of here soon, I will die. Here. Alone. Please. There are three states of being. Awake, asleep, and somewhere in between. When coming in and out of REM sleep, a hormone is released into the brain. This suppresses all body-motor function, paralyzing the sleeper. It's actually a handy little trick of nature. Prevents us from acting out our dreams. Some people wake up while in this state, paralyzed but fully aware. Some people suffer hallucinations, waking nightmares. Almost everyone in their lifetime will experience sleep paralysis. And no one talks about it because of the stigma of insanity, but... crazy you are not. So, these sessions are here to provide a forum for people to speak openly about their experiences. So... It's over to you. Let's hear some of your stories. I was having a bad nightmare, the old dream. I must've been trying to fight it 'cause... When I woke up, I was paralyzed, and there was... something on my chest. I couldn't move. Like there was something in my room... watching me. - Something evil. - ...evil. The Devil. Satan. I, I, I-- I couldn't see it. ...but it was there. She's here now. She's in this room watching us. I see her when I'm awake, when I'm not paralyzed. At my home... At my church... here, now, stalking me. Saul, who are you talking about? Haggard old woman, sent by Satan. - It's Mara. - Dougie please, not again. Can we let Saul speak? I swear to God almighty. She's a demon! - Sent to claim my soul from Satan. - Saul, - whatever you do, do not sleep! - Dougie, please. When we come in out of deep sleep in a sleep paralysis, sometimes we take our nightmares with us. - Okay? What you saw was a hallucination. - It's a ghost that... It was no hallucination! It was the Devil incarnate! Saul, I'm warning you. You are in grave danger. Enough, Dougie, you're scaring him. - It's not real, Saul. - Bullshit! Dougie. Saul, Saul. If you sleep tonight, you will die. Dougie! Please. Okay? Look at this. He's cursed! Hey! Hey! Okay, let's all just calm down. There are no such thing as curses. Oh, really? And how the fuck would you know? Saul, listen to me. You see her when you're awake, and that means you're in the final stage! When you get home tonight, you turn on all the lights. You get an alarm code, you get 50 alarm codes! You get the music, and you blast it up loud! You do whatever it is you need to do to stay awake! Or you will die tonight! Oh, God, please don't let them put their hands on me! You see this? This is bullshit! Mara is real. She is very, very real, and she will kill each and every one of us! You mark my words. Tonight, Saul dies! Yo, that is enough! This is bullshit! I'm sorry, you okay? You all right? You're not listening to me. Dougie said Saul would die. Tonight! That's a real threat, right? Maybe, Dougie's our killer. If you get a lead, you come to me. You don't follow it up yourself. I've just separated a mother and daughter. You may not get how awful that is, but I do. - So, I will put this right. - Enough. Go home now while I'm still being nice. Or I will personally see to it that this is the last homicide case you ever work on. You have one message. Tuesday, 8:48 p.m. Kate, she's getting closer. I have to see Sophie, please, to say good-bye. You put me in here. Please just-- just get me out! All lines are currently closed. Patient phone hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Lord, give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Thine is the power and the grace and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. Jesus, God, purify me! Purify me, your servant. Hasten my journey toward you. Father who art in Heaven, deliver me from evil. Lord forgive me. Hello? Dr. Fuller. What's the matter, you okay? I'm okay, yeah. Must've been a bad dream. I just woke up. This Dougie character, did you say he threatened a man named Saul? Yes. Why? 'Cause I'm with Saul right now. Found him living in a dilapidated shack over on Killhope Island. Living in the middle of nowhere, a real hermit. - What did he say? - Not a damn thing. Figured you could do some, uh, psychology on him. Maybe get him to admit to knowing the victims. - About before, I, uh, I'm sorry-- - Listen. What you did was against procedure. It was reckless and stupid. But it did lead to an arrest. So, let's just consider the matter closed, all right? Now, let's go nail this lowlife. Time is 15:32, 12th of November. This is Lieutenant Mike McCarthy. Also present is forensic psychologist, Dr. Kate Fuller. Suspect is Dougie Trenton. Mr. Trenton, do you know a Mr. Takahashi? No comment. Matthew Wynsfield? No comment. Saul Conlan? No comment. Dougie, did you kill these people? No comment. Yesterday, several witnesses heard you say that Saul was going to die. And just like you said, he died. I didn't kill him. - I warned him. - Warned him of what? This is going nowhere. Mara. Tell me about Mara. You're not the first person to talk about her. Help me understand. I can help you, but you have to talk. Did you know a Mr. Takahashi? I met him at the group sessions. He was the first person to see her. I mean, I thought... I thought he was nuts. But that night, she came to me, too. We started looking into it, Takahashi and me. You would not believe the shit that we found. Mara... Mara has been killing people since the dawn of time. Did you kill Mr. Takahashi? No. I didn't. Matthew Wynsfield, did you know him? Yeah. And his wife Helena. But he was marked. - Marked? - Marked, like this. Oh, I told him. I warned him, "Do not sleep." But he didn't listen. But once you're marked, that's it. It's over. So, this demon, she marks you first, and then she kills you? Yes. So, how come they're all dead but you're still alive? Fuck you. You know what? I knew this. I knew you wouldn't believe me. You want to know what I believe? I believe you're the only suspect in three murders! Suspect all you want, detective. But you do not have a single shred of evidence. - Dougie-- - No comment. Well, he's right about one thing. All we have is hearsay. He has no alibi, but no motive, either. Don't look so literally. Dougie genuinely believes a demon killed those people. What if that demon was him? Another aspect of his personality. Still, without any physical evidence I can't make an arrest. But we'll keep tabs on him. He'll slip up sooner or later. Well, thanks partly to you, we have a viable suspect. So, I guess Helena Wynsfield can go home and be with her daughter. You want to be the one to give the good news? So, normally, we would just bring the patients to the visiting area. You know, they don't really get many visitors just to their rooms. Yeah, if I had more time, I would've arranged-- Oh, no, it's not a problem at all. Helena? Helena, you have a visitor-- Someone help! Over here! Someone help! Helena? Call 911! Helena? Go, go! 911! Go! "Dougie Trenton, old mower shack, Killhope Island." - Dougie... - Go fuck yourself. No, wait, wait, wait, wait! I've seen her, too! What is all this? Research. Oh, did you think it was just you and me, eh? I don't know what to think anymore. Millions of people have seen it, Kate. All over the world. In Japan, they call her Kanashibari. In Zanzibar, they call her Popobawa. In Canada, they call her the Night Hag. But over here, it's Mara. She's everywhere. In medieval literature, art, the Chinese Book of Dreams. The first recorded evidence is 400 BC. Think about it. Mara predates Christ! And look at this. Fuseli. Fuseli paints her in 1781, 1781! There must be some other explanation for all of this. Yeah? Like what? I don't know. - Hallucinations. - Hallucinations? Yes. Hallucinations. Okay. See these? These are just some of the recent sightings! And what about Takahashi? What about Helena? What about Saul, Matthew, me, you? If these are hallucinations, Kate, then how come we all see her? Mara is real, and she's killed before. Look at this. Right here, 1977. One hundred Hmong refugees die in their sleep after experiencing an evil presence crushing their chest. And then again, 1983, Thailand, 230 people are found dead in their sleep! Now, no doctor or psycho-fucking-therapist can explain these deaths! And now she's here, and she's killing again. So, millions see her, but she only kills a few? Why? I don't know. I haven't worked this out yet. But there is some kind of pattern. She kills in clusters, always, after a tragedy or an event. It's like Mara is in the spirit world and the tragedy somehow brings her into our world. But there hasn't been any big tragedy here recently. Well, then maybe we've missed it. Well, how do you miss a tragedy? I'm sorry, Dougie, but this is crazy! Please, you have got to start believing me! Listen... you're at stage two. Stage two, what? She comes in stages. I've worked this out. Look, stage one. You're paralyzed, and you see her. Now, millions of people experience this, but for some, nothing else happens. For the unlucky ones like us, it goes to stage two. She marks you, red in the eye. This is where you are, Kate! Then it moves to stage three, the physical contact. She climbs up on your chest, she places her hands around your throat. And then it's stage four. Soon, you'll see her when you're awake. She'll be in your waking world. And the next time you sleep... you're dead. Well, if this is true, how come you're still alive? I only sleep for 20 minutes at a time. I've figured out that Mara only comes if you're in a deep sleep. I set all of the alarms, music, anything I can, for 20-minute intervals. I never sleep for more than 20 minutes. And that way, she can't get into my waking world. Dougie, how long has it been since you had a proper sleep? I don't know. A few weeks, a month. I can't remember. Do you realize what effect that will have on your mind? Dougie, you're severely sleep deprived. - Kate... - All this talk about sleep demons and-- Kate, you have to listen to me, Kate! Now, you can believe all this science and this forensic bullshit, but I am telling you right now, you are marked. Our only hope is to figure out what links us all, or we're all dead! Kate! Kate! Listen to me! I'm warning you! Do not sleep! Find the link, Kate, so we can stop her! Dr. Ellis? I need to show you something. It's like an invisible force is lifting her up and slamming her back down, right? But nothing supernatural. Convulsions, a seizure. What about the mark? Helena had it, and now I do, too. Mark? - Just a burst blood vessel. - No, people have died. Can you explain that? Not without looking into their individual circumstances, no. What about the Hmong refugees? Over a hundred died in their sleep. - SUNDS. - What? Sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome. It has nothing to do with sleep paralysis. Come here, I want to show you something. Most sleep labs are clinical, like hospitals. But for more accurate results, the patient should feel more at home. It's tinted, two-way. The control room's on the other side. Thanks, Carly. So, this is where we monitor the sleepers. This is all great, but what does it have to do with Helena's death? I was just a kid the first time I got sleep paralysis. I swear to God, Freddy Krueger was in my room. - For me, it was aliens. - Ah, the generation gap. Ever since Roswell, the whole UFO phenomenon, alien abductions have increased tenfold. You mean since The X-Files. Uh, sorry, what are you saying? It's no coincidence that people share similar hallucinations. What we see in sleep paralysis is directly influenced by the culture around us, things that scare us. For me, it was Freddy Krueger. In the old days, it was witches. Fast forward to Mulder and Scully over here and boom, aliens. Yeah, but Mara isn't part of our culture. Why did I see her? Simple. Helena told you her sleep demon story. It scared you, stayed with you, and then you suffer sleep paralysis, and as if by magic, you see the same thing. I'm telling you, as a scientific fact, Mara is not real. And sleep paralysis cannot kill. You have nothing to fear. Thank you, doctor. Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? You left me alone to die! Hello? Mr. Wynsfield? It's Dr. Fuller. I just want to check on Sophie. How is she doing? She's terrible. She's not sleeping right. She's having bad dreams. It all happened after you spoke with her. She's got it in her head that it was her fault her mother got locked up. I'm so sorry. It's the funeral tomorrow. Please, just leave us alone. We are here today to join... You have one new voice message. Kate, it's Dougie. I fell asleep, Kate. I'm at stage four! She's here. I can't sleep, or I am dead! You've got to help me, please! I'm gonna do something bad. Kate, help me! Mustn't sleep. Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake. Mustn't sleep. Mustn't sleep. Mustn't sleep. Mustn't sleep. Stay awake. Mustn't sleep. Stay awake. Dougie? Dougie! Dougie! Oh, God. - Oh, God. God. - Kate... What have you done? - What have you done? - She's coming. Please. She's coming. Please... - This is stage four. - No. This is stage four! - She's here, Kate! - No! - She's here, Kate! - There's no one here. There's no one here, it's just me! I'm gonna die, Kate. I don't want to die. Please help me. I will. I will, I promise. But you have to trust me, okay? Hold on, just hold on. - Kate? - Dr. Ellis! - You okay? - I need help. Dougie's hurt himself. He's on stage four. And I've seen it. Kate, calm down. Just bring him into the clinic. I can't understand what's happening. I can help him here. Trust me, I can help you. Kate, you're exhausted. Dougie, too. All you need is a good night's sleep and your problems will be over. I hope you're right. It'll help calm you. Any sign of anything unusual, and we'll wake you up immediately. I promise. It's all a waste of time, Kate. She's got me beat. You're in safe hands now. Everything is going to be fine. I'm right by your side and I'm not leaving. I know why she comes now. I've worked it out. Shh, shh, shh, It's the fucking war. We were at a checkpoint. Everything was on edge. We hadn't slept for days. Dougie, you don't have to-- Then out of the dust, a vehicle came toward us. A car. I signaled for it to stop, but... it just kept on coming. We'd already lost two men, I didn't want to lose anybody else. I opened fire. Then the car... slowed down. It stopped. And that's when I heard it. The crying and the wailing. It was the most haunting sound I've ever heard. Dougie... A young woman. A girl. A mother. She took a bullet to the chest. She was bleeding to death. She was holding her dead baby. She looked straight at me. Oh, God, forget it, Kate. What the fuck did I do? The fuck did I do, Kate? Hush, Dougie... Sleep. Sleep, Dougie. Everything is going to be okay. I'm right here. Sleep now. Let's get this show on the road. Subject asleep, 23:45. Okay, Mara, let's see what you got. So much for sleep demons. Oh, shit! Carly! Carly! Dougie! Dougie! Christ! Dougie! Dougie! Kate! Wake up, Kate! Kate, wake up! Kate, wake up! - I was watching. - No! No, it can't be! Oh, my God! Oh my God! We had him wired, monitored. I don't know what this is. It's okay, doctor. Take your time. I'm a scientist. I deal with the facts and logic. Not-- Not this. This... McCarthy. Oh, no. What happened? Last night, she had some sort of fit. She stopped breathing. Now she's seeing things. Hey. Hey. She's behind you. Listen, she's in the final stage. Do not let her sleep. Please, if she sleeps, she will die. Get out. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I'll be back, Sophie. I promise. Just stay awake. Just keep her awake. Shit. Shit. Shit. What is this? What can it be? What can it be? You are marked! My husband was killed by a sleep demon! You'll see her even when you are awake. The next time you sleep, you're dead. Takahashi, Matthew, Saul. Helena. Dougie. Sophie. Matthew, Helena, Dougie. What's the link? Find the link, Kate, so we can stop her! I'm warning you, do not sleep! Sophie... Takahashi, Matthew... "Lead the way." Oh, Dougie. The war. Saul's accident. Helena? Helena. He begged for me to stay, but I just-- I couldn't, not even for Sophie. I felt so guilty. And now he's dead. You blame yourself for Matthew's death. And I blame myself for yours. Saul killed his mom. Matthew had an affair. Dougie killed in Iraq. In every other outbreak, there was a big tragedy. Why not here? Takahashi. What did you do? - Hello? - Takahashi. Who is he? What did he do? Kate, what-- Where the hell are you? Listen to me! Listen to me, Takahashi did something. Something so big, so awful, that he caused all this. What did he do? Kate, what-- what in the hell-- - Tell me! - All right, all right, all right. Back in Japan, he was a chef in a primary school. He cut a deal on some cheap food, uh... raw fish that was contaminated. Thirty-eight kids died. He'd been on the run ever since. That's it, that's the tragedy that brought her. - Brought who? - Mara! Takahashi went on the run, ended up here. But he felt so bad for what he had done that his guilt brought Mara out! She killed him, then spread, drawn to people's guilt. The sleep clinic group, friends and family. That's it! - That's how she works! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... You sound like Dougie. What the hell are you talking about? Listen to me! Dougie killed innocents in Iraq, Saul killed his mom, Matthew had an affair, Helena blamed herself for the divorce, I had an innocent woman committed and orphaned Sophie. - It's guilt! - What about Sophie? What does an eight-year-old kid have to feel guilty about? - She talked to me. - What? Her grandfather told her that if she talked to me I would lock her mommy away. Sophie blames herself! I have to put her right! - Wait, Kate! - Sophie's in the final stage! Mara is coming for her next! I have to tell her that none of this is her fault. I'm to blame! Wait, wait, Kate, wait! Dr. Fuller? Shit! Helena? This is the City Cross Ferry Line. Next stop Stanley Park. Brandon Memorial Hospital. Yes! I wanted to go! It was a whole thing. You bad boy! Sophie. It's Kate, honey. There's something I need to tell you. Sophie! Sophie, can you hear me? Sophie, you did nothing wrong. It was my fault, not yours. Soph-- Wake up! No! No! No! No! Don't you touch her! No! No, don't you touch her! No, don't you touch her! I'm the guilty one, not her! Stop! Blame me! Blame me! Blame me! Blame me! No! No! Wake up, Sophie! Wake up! Wake up! You're innocent! - Sophie. Sophie. - I don't blame you. It's okay. You're innocent, too. It's okay. It's over. You can sleep. Mr. Fluffy looks tired. Sweet dreams. Kate? Kate? Kate? You okay? - Yeah. How is she? - Doctor says she'll be fine. I guess it was all in her mind. Demons only exist up here. Come on, you've had a rough night. Let me give you a ride home. Yeah, thank you. Just one second. Morning, Sophie. I hear you're feeling much better today. And so is Mr... Huh. Where are the stitches? I forgive you, but Mom can't. - Sophie. - I will never forgive you! You left me alone to die!
