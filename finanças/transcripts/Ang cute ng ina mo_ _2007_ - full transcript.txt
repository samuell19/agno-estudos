[Georgia] This is where it all begins. Even though I don't know the spelling of 'crony' that was why we needed to leave the country with my husband, Jack and our very cute daughter, Christine. Jack, I can't take it anymore! [voice over PA system] ...for Melbourne, Australia... I need to pee! [voice over PA system] Attention to all passengers... Jack, I'm going to pee! Don't keep me here. I need to pee! But, honey, it's the last call. Go! [panting] Come, Ferdie. Remember, I want to go to Paoay. Is this really all that's left? Paoay, Meldie, okay? Paoay. -[Georgia] Go on, I need to pee. -You can wait for the whole duration of the flight. -Here, take the kid with you. -Honey. -[baby cries] -Be back, okay? I have to pee first. Honey, don't forget, HOLLAND! Hope Our Love Lasts and Never Dies! ITALY! I Trust And Love You MONACO! May Our Noble Affair Continue Onwards IRELAND!

Oh, come on, Georgia! [baby screams, cries] [exhales] [voice over PA system] Paging CR-717 -Cabin passenger, Georgia Quizon -[whimpering] please board 285 immediately. [gasping] -[baby crying] -Sir, please take your seat. No, you don't understand. My fiancée isn't on board. Okay, I'll check. Wait! Wait! Wait! [in Kapampangan] What's this? How cute! How cute! Your mom must be cute too. [in Kapampangan] What would you like? Asleep. Take a nap. Wait a second! Mm! [screaming] Wait! Wait! [screaming] [whimpering] [Georgia] After my broken bones have healed. I still didn't give up. There. Miss, miss the end of the line is over there. You can't cut. We were here first. -You belong in the back. -Okay, okay. -No cutting! -[clamoring] -Who do you think you are? -Ouch! -To the back! -I know! [clamoring] Sir, I'm Georgia. [chipmunks voice] Here are my passport and papers. And my pictures too. ♪ If you will be happy with someone else ♪ ♪ And if heaven is whenever you're with him ♪ [normal voice] Alms, give me a piece of bread. Give me. [singing] [groaning, grunting] I thought getting a visa for Australia is like getting one for Japan. I was wrong. [screams] I have a visa! I'm okay. -Dude, she's fine. Let's go. -I have a visa! [giggling] At last, l did it! But fate is cruel. Whenever I get close to achieving my dream to be reunited with my family, it is taken away. I don't want Christine to grow up -without a mother. -[cries] I was running against time, and the taxi. -Mister! Mister! My bag! -Huh? What? -Mister, my bag! -What? What? Mister, stop the car. My bag! -What? -[tire screeches] [pants] My bag. Oh, this. [motorcycle revs] [Georgia grunts] [snatcher laughs, whooping] [taxi driver] I can't go farther, Ma'am. -There's a road block. -You're such a-- You're letting this stop you? [Georgia] Just when everything is in place the coup d'état happened. [gun fires] Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I don't like Cory! I don't like Cory! Ugh! I just want to go to Australia! [whimpering] [gasps] Gringo? [whimpering] Australia, here I come! [humming] [giggling] -I was on my way to Australia. -Sorry, ma'am, there seems to be a problem. -Huh? -You can't board the plane. [security guard] Look. Get out of my way! I'm going to Australia! -I'm going to Australia! -Ma'am, you can't! -I'm going to Australia! -Get out! Get out! I'm going to Australia! I'm going to Australia! -Believe me. -[Jack] No! My passport was shot! Stop it, Georgia! Stop all these lies! -Believe me! -Now I know you don't love me. -I love you, Jack! -There might be someone else. I love you, Georgia. You know that! But I'm sick and tired of waiting! Stop emoting. Mosquitoes are feasting on me. From now on, you don't have a daughter. And I don't have a wife. I call it quits! [screams] Jack! [Georgia] That's the last I heard from them. I didn't have a single cent. So I worked as a fish sauce maker for Don Emong Goloid. A fish sauce magnate. He is Don Emong. He owns this factory. -Good morning, Sir Emong. -Mm. Emong is kind. He likes my future. -My present... -Will you marry me? And my past. I know he can pave the way for me to go from Malabon to Melbourne, Australia. Georgia! Will you take long? Just a moment. I'm almost finished! Oh, sorry! [grunting] [screams] [Georgia] Don Emong didn't even get to score. But the inheritance he left me proved better than winning the lottery. [plane whistling] Wow! The first thing I did is to find my family in Australia. I was like playing hide and seek with Jack I was 'it' in this game and couldn't win. -I didn't find them. -[whimpers] I returned to the Philippines with tears in my eyes. Ma'am, there's a boy at the gate. Yes, stop being such a radio actress, I can see that! And there's a message. "I can no longer take care of my child. I will leave him in your care. P.S. If ever his mother looks for him, don't give him to her." Dot, dot, dot. Where's the rest of the letter? On his skin! "Because his mother is busy." Who is your mother? Like an answer to my prayers, Val came into my life. -[giggling] -Val, Val, Val. Innocent Val. This is tiring! Even slightly, the longing for my real child has been eased. -[Junjun screaming] -Hey, what's that? ♪ Ho, ho ♪ ♪ Hi, hi Ho ho ♪ ♪ Hi, hi ♪ ♪ How cute, cute, cute Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ Cute, cute Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ How cute, cute, cute Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ How cute, cute, cute Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Listen to me To what I have to say ♪ ♪ Mothers must be loved All of them are beautiful ♪ ♪ Even when cross-eyed Ho, ho ♪ ♪ Or dark skinned Hi, hi ♪ ♪ If not for them, kid, you won't be here ♪ ♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ♪ ♪ And where do you go when you cry? ♪ ♪ Who do you call? ♪ ♪ Wasn't she the one who gave you life? ♪ ♪ Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ How cute, cute, cute Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ Cute, cute Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ How cute Your mother is so cute ♪ ♪ Cute, cute Your mother is so cute ♪ Dad?

That's great! -[Christine giggling] So, what course are you finally taking? -Advertising! -[Nanny gasps] -Wait a minute. -I thought -Where's dad? -you like fashion designing? Nanny I do, but that comes naturally. I want something where I'm actually learning. Oh, but I have to tell you something. [crying] Aunt Gemma! Aunt Gemma, what's wrong? -Where are you going? -[Aunt Gemma continuous crying] Aunt Gemma, why are you crying? I'm leaving on a jet plane! I'm leaving your father! But-- But why? Aren't we one big happy family? Yes! But I've always been a mother. A father. A daughter. A stepmother in this family! That's why we're not happy. Don't you know that, Christine? Jack is still in love with your mother! No, no, no, that's nonsense! That's really silly! It's not true. No, no I'm leaving! No. No, please don't leave us! -Goodbye, Christine. Goodbye! -No! -Daddy, Aunt Gemma's leaving us. -I will find her. Well, you can find her outside now. No, I'll find Georgia. And ask her to marry me. Dad, no! Aunt Gemma has been a good mother to me and a good girlfriend to you. I can't cheat myself anymore. Have you forgotten what she did to you? To us, 20 years ago. I tried so hard. But nothing can ever replace the warmth of her tender embrace. [gasps] Crikey! Christine, what are you doing? Why are you packing your stuff? These aren't my clothes, they're yours. I'm all set. We are going to the Philippines. To meet my mother. Oh! That's very touching. I thought you're angry with your mother? Then why do you want a reunion? No. The reason why I'm doing this is to destroy daddy's plans to marry my mother! [grunts] Your antagonism ventures far and wide. -Mm! -You're stressing me out. [Georgia] Junjun, is the rice ready yet? [Junjun] Here it is, Ma'am. Hey, put a shirt on. Thanks! -Mm! -[Val gasps] Use the spoon! Can you hand that to me, please? [telephone rings] Junjun, answer the phone. -Val, the phone. -[telephone ringing continous] Mom, the phone. Wait. I gave the order, and I'm still the one doing it. You. You go. You're the nearest. You're the youngest here. Huh? Hello? Yeah, yeah! Uh, fine, fine, fine. Bye! Bye. -Who was that? -Huh? That was Christine, your daughter. -What? -Mm. Why didn't you tell me? Christine? [sobs] Christine, my child! Christine! Hello? Why didn't you tell me? I have been waiting for her for so long. I couldn't understand her, except for the, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" part. I can't understand why you didn't tell me! [gasps] I can't breathe. -Mom? -Wait a sec. -It's been so long... -Mom, wait.. -It's been so long... -Wait a minute. -The phone, why... -Junjun! She's having an epileptic attack! Put her a spoon in her mouth! -[Val] Spoon? -[grunts] -Put a fork. -Fork? -Here. Here! Ah! Ah! -[grunts] I'll do everything to save you! I'll get a ladle! Junjun, the ladle! -What! -What is it? I don't have epilepsy! This isn't the reason I can't breathe but that light over there! Who put that there? -You! -You! Huh! Me? Okay. What did she say? Val, why didn't you tell me that was Christine? What did she say? Nothing, she said she was in a hurry. She told me she was coming to see you. My daughter is coming? Christine is coming. My daughter is coming. [festive music playing] [Georgia] Mm. Let's make this fast. I want my daughter's welcome party to be extraordinary. You are exceptional, Georgia. The feast isn't until next week. You came in advance! But of course! This is for my daughter! Quickly! Put everything inside. Hey, Junjun! Why are you dressed like that? Why did you include me here? You're forcing me to join them. Can't I be a Singkil Princess instead? You want to be part of the Singkil? Fine. You carry the bamboo! -I like it right here. -Let's get a move on. We're going to be late. -My daughter is coming! -[man screaming] Come here! [grunts] Don't come any closer! Give me a helicopter. Five million pesos and a visa to Australia. It was difficult even for me to get a visa to Australia! [man grunts] Don't hurt my mother. Don't hurt my mother! [screams] [people gasps] -Easy. I'm coming towards you. -[woman] Georgia! [whimpers, screams] [people screams] Val, hurry! PR 432! Wait for someone who looks like me. Go on. Junjun, go now. Wait at the airport. Wait for someone who looks like me! -Relax. Wait! -[clamoring] Go, Junjun. [indistinct chattering] [woman on speaker announcing] Christine, you might want to help me. -Why don't you give me a hand? -Nanny. You can handle it. Your arms are so big. They'll be wasted if you're not going to use them, right? Oh, my! Hurry up, Nanny. By the way how are you supposed to... [stuttering] how will you... Uh, how will you make your mother look bad to your daddy? Show me! [gasps] [chuckles] [tapping] [festive music playing] [Junjun screams] Welcome home, Christine! [cheering] -Welcome home, Christine! -Welcome home, Christine! There's Christine! Hi, Christine! Mwah! Welcome! I'm not Christine. [Delfin] You're not Christine. She said to find someone who resembled her. Where's Mom? Where's my mom? I don't know! You evacuate! We don't know where's your mom! We're waiting for Christine! -You go there! -But I am Christine. I'm the one you're looking for! You are Christine, daughter of Georgia Quizon? -Uh-huh. -Unfortunately. Absolutely! [all] Oh! Oh, yeah. She's Christine, and I'm her nanny. But you, handsome, can call me Honey for short. Ah! She takes after her father! Uh, well, where's my mom? And where's our ride? There. There. [tire screeches] -My God! -On the billboard? Not that. The woman on the billboard with the hideous armpit. Tell them to get my helicopter, quickly! -Mister, let's go. -Come on! [police on megaphone] Please come down from there. -What your doing is dangerous! -Give way! -Come down already! -There's Mom. Up there. Surrender peacefully! -Mom! -Release Georgia Quizon. That's my mom? That's my mom? What is she doing up there? Oh, wow. I think it's part of the welcoming committee! Don't be silly! She's a hostage! Can't you see? I'm sorry. Georgia, my love. Wait for me. I'll rescue you. [crowd] Oh! -[Junjun] Do it. -[Nanny] Go ahead. I'll pray for you. Nitwit! Give me that. Ma'am, we're here. We have your daughter with us. Here she is. Ma'am, you lied. You said she looked like you. But she's so beautiful! My child! [whimpering] Get her down. -Mister hostage. -Oh? I have not seen my daughter for 20 years. Her father took her away from me. He brought her to Australia. My whole life... I didn't think of anything else but to hold and kiss her. How will I be able to do that if you kill me now? [both cry] [people gasp] [cheering] My child! [sobs] [band playing] This is my daughter! My daughter! Meet my daughter! My child, do you want to eat? -Here. -Is this good? -This will be your house. -Good day! Forgive us if the food is too few. I was in a rush. I wasn't able to prepare instantly. Do you want fruits? We have star apple. There's papaya. Banana. We have Malabon fried noodles. Malabon roasted pig. -Malabon rice cakes. -[sniffing] -Malabon mangoes. -It stinks. There's also Malabon melons. Malabon bananas. -[Nanny] Malabon. Malabon. -Malabon fish sauce. -Fish sauce? -Malabon candy. Um, I think it's kinda hot here, don't you think? Yeah! Don't worry my child, tomorrow I will have the entire house air-conditioned. And for daytime I think it's dark. It's dark! -I agree. -Excuse me. Ah, I called Meralco yesterday. They said they will be coming here to add electric posts. So this house will be brighter. How about water? Is the flow of water strong here? Do you have strong water flow? It's stronger than your attitude. And because we are in Malabon flood water comes even when uninvited. Wait. Who's this? Is this the koala bear you brought me? No, she's my nanny. Nanny? Nanny? You're only the nanny but you act as if you're some official. Ma'am, where do we put their luggage? In Christine's room. [Nanny gasping] [giggling] I'll just tell them to chop the roasted pig for you. -This is where we will start. -Okay. This is where we will know if my mother is pagan or anti-Christ. All right! Street fighter. Drunkard. Gambler. We were just shocked when she got back from Japan, already female. -[both gasps] -Wait, wait, Father. You mean she is a pest to society? Ah, mm! And if she's a transvestite from Japan, then Georgia must be... Mm-mm? Georgia who? I'm talking about Georgie! -Georgie? -Georgie? No, we're talking about Georgia. Georgia Quizon. Ah, Madam Georgia? -Mm-mm. -Yes. That woman is an angel on earth. She actually funded the construction of half of this church. She comes to mass everyday. A true follower of God. Is it true that Georgia is stingy? [woman grunts] I will dice to a pulp anyone who says Madam Georgia is stingy! Okay! Okay! If she is not stingy, then maybe she doesn't pay her bills. An alcoholic? Or a swindler? Or maybe she's paying you -to say good things about her? -Mm-mm, mm-mm. Get out of here! -[both screaming] -If you have to know Georgia is an extremely good friend and customer! My children was able to graduate from high school because she always buys from me! She buys everything I sell! Compassionate. Generous. Humble. Oh, that's fantastic! You're so plastic! We are making you describe -a person, not a saint. -Yeah. But she's really a kind person. And a virtuous neighbor. We can't make things up. Or dig up the history of her relationship with Don Emong! Mm! Nothing. Because of Don Emong's goodness, and Georgia's diligence she inherited the fish sauce factory. -See? -[nanny gasps] Who is this Don Emong? Hey! Let's go. Don Emong. Don Emong. [both] Mm? [Val] Ouch! Later! Later! [Val grunting, screaming] It stings! [Georgia] Of course, this is the third time. Push to your limit! I know you have more in you. It really hurts. -Let's stop first. -Why stop now? This is the only chance we have. -[Val] Ouch! -[Georgia moans] Just a few more, and you'll feel better. [gasps] [Val] I'll adjust my timing. Wait. Wait a moment. -Save it for later. -Don't worry. I'm all fired up and ready to go. Don't be like that now. And don't be too loud. When my daughter comes home -she might hear us. -[Val] Come on. -I'm going in. -Do it. -[Val grunting] -Count first. -One. Two. Three. -One. Two. Three. [both grunting] This is nasty. It spurted on me. It's viscous. Psst. Psst! -You! Come here. -Huh? -Yes, you, come here. -Me? -Come here. -Is Georgia there? Georgia? Do you and Georgia have a relationship? No. I wish we did. Is she not your sugar mommy? She's sweet. But she's not my sugar mommy! I love her. I don't believe you. I think-- I think you're lying. -Stupid. -Junjun, where is Georgia? -Unbelievable! -Delfin! It's late! Go home! Don't disturb, Ma'am. -My life sucks. -Junjun, let's go ice skating. -No! Close the gate! Stupid! -Oh! Junjun, you're naughty. You know, if she lived here, I'm going to be so happy. She will have a hard time adjusting. You may be her mother, but she didn't grow up with you. Am I asking for your opinion? Why are you so sour when it comes to Christine? That's not true. I'm only telling the truth. And I know my place, Mom. I'm just a nobody! [scoffs] You're so cute when you're jealous. There's no reason for you to feel insecure. Come now, give me a smile. Don't fret. I know. Mm. [indistinct chattering] [gasps] Nanny, hurry up! Faster! -Faster! -I'm coming. I'm coming! -Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. -Ouch! -Come inside! -You hurt me. Look at this. Your mother is shameless. My gosh, he's old enough to be her son! That's exactly my point. I told you there's something going on between them. And now that we have enough evidence, you can go home. -Just me? Wait. Just me? -Mm-mm. You're not coming? Don't tell me, you're in love with the gay guy. Oh, my gosh! He's not gay. He's just feminine. Whatever! Dad, I just want you to know that I'm doing this for you. I wanna save you from making another mistake so... that's why I'm going to give you a hundred and one reasons why you shouldn't marry this woman. Four thousand seven, four thousand eight -Four thousand nine. -Val, did you see the other bottle caps? [grunts] Can't you see I'm in the middle of something here? Where was I? [grunts] One, two, three, four, five... -Oh, hello, Junjun! -[Junjun gasps] Look! I brought you some lunch. You're just in time! I'm so hungry. What is that? Bring me breakfast. It's just ten in the morning and you're talking about lunch? Oh, I prepared this myself. It's fish fillet. Fish? Again? We are surrounded here with fish! I don't want fish! I want meat! -You're such a snob. -Ouch! Miss Nanu, Miss Nanu? Has Christine woken up? -Why? -Maybe she wants to go on a tour, I'll take her. Oh, I know that sound. You want to court her? Bloody Mary! How dare you? Hey! For your information Val is popular here in Malabon. Girls and gays alike are willing to risk their lives just to go out with him. Yes, Christine may very well die if she consents to him. Die of hunger! Don't you know that Christine has plenty of suitors in Australia? Do you know Mel Gibson? -[gasps] Mel Gibson? -Mel Gibson? -Mel Gibson courted her? -No! But the nephew of the laundry woman of Mel Gibson who's filthy rich courted Christine. And not only that. There's this another Aussie who courted her. Aussie? Aussie, who? Michael Jackman. Michael Jackman who owns many kangaroos. Well, there are many kangaroos in Australia. Yes, but even the kangaroos are courting Christine. -And these kangaroos are rich. -[Val] Huh? Because they were also given inheritance. And they don't eat fish sauce. You don't really eat fish sauce. It's a condiment. Excuse me. Now, what can you say about Christine's wealthy suitors? Excellent! Excellent! Val, go and sell fish sauce. So you can have money to go to Australia. And buy a kangaroo. Two, four, six, eight, twenty, twenty five... Christine, let's eat. I cooked the food. Your mom went to the market. So she entrusted you to me. She told me to feed you. I'll eat whenever I want to. I can only eat if you're not around. Why, Christine? Why! What's the mother? Why you're so anger? Please! Don't speak in English! You're disgusting. As disgusting as the things you and Mom do. Wait a sec. What did you say? I don't understand you. Can you... Can you please explain? In English, please. [blowing raspberries] Val, my friend. [chuckles] How are you? Don't interrupt, Jojo! Have you gotten to first base with... No! That girl's temper is incredible. -But why? -This is me we're talking about! You of all people know that... every girl in this town is crazy for me. Of course! Every girl in this factory! Don't interfere with my life. They're all after my body. -It really is big! -Correct! But I can't spell this girl out. Here. Think as if you are her. Pretend you're Christine. [imitates Christine] Hello. -Good day. -Then suddenly... I pass by. With these muscles. Look at these muscles, Jojo. Even I am enamored with my body, Jojo. -They're so big. -Aren't they? Then he suddenly grabs you. What will you do? Val. -Jojo. -Val. [gasps] [Val grunts] [workers gasp] Sorry, dude. Look what you did! You drenched me in fish sauce! [music playing] My child, I never thought this day would come. Your father took you away from me for 20 years. I kept thinking: "What would you look like if, let's say, you got Jack's eyes and the shape of my face." You still look like an angel, just like the last time I saw you. -Hey! -[screams] [gasps] What's wrong with you? Why are you scaring me? I wasn't. Why do you simply stroll in here without permission? You must be forgetting that this is my house. Oh, yeah? I don't know what your plans for Christine are. But don't you mess up her life. She belongs to Jack and me. Oh, yes. Jack. All it took was one night. His seed was strong and needed fertile soil. Oh, yeah? So you're fertile and I'm barren. But with what's happening, you are like a diner open to all who want to eat. How will you prove that you're indeed the legal and faithful wife? You are deranged! Who do you think you are? You're just the nanny. You just made it sound pretty but it's still the same! Why, you were once hired help too, huh? But he loved me! -Come here! -Oh, no. Don't! [both grunting] [oriental music playing] [whimpering] [Georgia screams] [clattering] [Nanny screams, grunts] -I hate you! -I hate you back! -I hate you back and forth! -I hate you door to door! -[Nanny] Half-moon! -[Georgia] Dinner roll! -[Nanny] Mango! -[Georgia] Dumpling! -[Nanny] Flat bread! -[Georgia] Full moon! [Nanny] I hate you! I hate you! -I hate you! -Will you please just be quiet? Shush up. [grunts] [giggling] [whooping] [whistle blows] [grunts] Hey, will you be quiet? Delfin, what's going on? Georgia, come on. Let's play. Why are you playing badminton in front of my house? If possible I'll play inside. -So I can always see you. -My goodness. Get out of here, all of you! [Georgia] Your noise might wake my daughter up! Excuse me. What's going on? What's all this noise about? Why do you want them to leave? My dear, I didn't want them to disturb you. Because you were sleeping. But I love badminton. Oh, really? Me too. I love badminton. Wait. Come back! Come back! [player] Let's go back. After breakfast, we will have lunch. If by then, if you're still hungry, we will have snacks. Then we'll eat dinner. Do you have plans to own a meat shop and make a pig out of your daughter? I want to fill her belly with good food, you nut! Do you want to have another round from last night? No, actually! Your call! There! -Do you want anything else? -You know what? It's all right. Anyway, I'm not too fond of salty food. But I was wondering would you happen to have any cereal? -Cereals. Ah-- -Serial? What do you like, comics or killer? What? What are you talking about? You wanted serial, right? Serial comics or serial killers? [groans] Baloney! Can you not interfere with family affairs? Unless of course you actually want to stand up for it. Well, you are after all the boy toy of my mom. Well, aren't you ill-mannered. -Why! What do you want? -Val! Don't you talk like that. Especially when I don't understand what you're saying! It's better if you just eat so you won't get indigestion. [fake laughs] Hey Val, what is a 'boy toy'? Bro, why are you in such a bad mood? My mother's daughter is so distressing. She pisses me off! I'll just drink my troubles away. Bro, that's enough! -This is my business, Jojo! -She's just a girl. -This is my life! -She's just a girl, Bro. Take a picture of me and my daughter. Quickly! Take a picture! Take a picture! You two better patch up now. Val, go. Make peace. Please? Val, come on. Go on. [groans] It stinks! Auntie, I'll do it! -I'll take your picture. -Okay. -Ouch! Careful! -Sorry! Sorry, auntie! You know, this fish sauce factory is my tribute to you. Okay, smile! Why, is this how I smelled when I was a baby? -Kind of. -Strike a pose. My turn. Wait. If you don't mind, my turn? Okay. -Video? Okay. -Yeah. Hi, video. So tell me more about yourself. Hi! I'm Georgia Quizon. I'm born in Visayas! Impregnated in Makati and now hails in Malabon! We have a saying, that there's not a bland stew with salty fish sauce. -[cheering] -Mommy is the best. -What's your favorite color? -Ah... Color? Mm. Fuchsia. Fuchsia! Spell "fuchsia". Ah, can I pick red instead? [Val] Your questions are too corny. Uh, Mom, define love? Oh. I know that one. Love is the ultimate expression of any homo sapiens propensity to empathize with one another. -[both cheering] -My mommy's so smart! She's even better than you in English! -[Val] I have another one. -What is it? Love is like a rosary, it is full of mysteries. -[Georgia giggling] -Who is your first love? -My first love? Uh... -Yes. My first love... My first love is... Jack Outback. He is your father. He is my first... and last love. Let's cut this. I want to get out of here. I can't stand the stench. What's her problem? Australians are really like that. Besides, it does smell awful in here. Ew! [gasps] What? I know you're tired! You're just tired. What you're doing is even more tiring. We have something to do. Come with me. I'll hug your tiredness away. No! Please don't! -Don't be stubborn. -Please don't! -Come here. -I don't want to! -Oh, come on! Come on. -I don't want to! [grunting] There! You know, you're okay! As a wife? No, as a manicurist. Be gentle, darling. There! [grunting] [telephone rings] Hello. Hi, Daddy. Oh, hi, sweety. How are things in Malabon? How's everything there in Melbourne? I'm doing fine here. Isn't it Georgia great? Uh, well, actually, Dad... um, there are a lot of things I would like to talk about. Especially about Mom. Oh, darling, you don't have to tell me anything about Georgia. I know all about her. Dad. Look, okay. Trust me. You can't marry this woman. [Nanny] Christine, let's go. Look! I really have to go. I'll just call you some other time. -What? -Bye, Dad, I love you. Honey no, wait! Wait! [Junjun] Christine, I didn't know you fancy the night life. We have a lot of that here in Malabon. This is the bar I was talking about. Oh! [gasping] There! Ma'am! What is this? Junjun! Son of a-- This is a gay bar! What do you think we are? Gay? You said bar. Who did you ask? Here, this is the "bar." Bar! Bar! Gay Bar. If that's the case, let's go home! This is where they get handsome macho dancers in Manila. Why didn't you say so? Come, Christine. How delightful. [host] Ladies and gentlemen, here is the male attractions. -[cheering] -[Junjun] Here they come! [cheering] Ma'am, he is the one I was talking about! I see! Ma'am, that's the one! He's the star of the show. -Oh! -[cheering] -Didn't I tell you? Exotic! -[Val grunts] Let's go, Christine. I should have followed Madam Rosa's prediction. Don't go into the dark, or get bitten by insects. They pretty much look like mosquitoes. We're leaving. Nanny, we can't go home, okay. I wanna get Mom drunk. They say that a person's true colors come out when one is drunk. If you say so. Mom! Here, have some beer! My dear, I don't drink. -I might get drunk. -Mom, this is really nothing. It isn't that strong. -Drink! -Okay. Drink up! Cheers! Go! Christine, don't film her. Stop her. [Georgie giggling] You don't get a say in this. [laughing] -Mom, enough! -Why do you keep interfering? She's having fun! Is she? Or are you playing with her? Your face may be pretty but your attitude stinks! The only reason why you're reacting is because you're jealous because she was dancing with another man! Maybe you really are lovers! -My child. -[grunts] -Mom! -Auntie! -Auntie! Auntie! -[Junjun]This is crazy. [clamoring] Stay here. -[Junjun] Thank you, Delfin. -[Christine] Bye! We can handle this. -Take care. -Bye. Come on, let's sleep. -Val, you take care of Georgia. -[Georgia] My child. I'm sorry, dear. Mom, what are you saying? She got you drunk and now you're apologizing to her? Val. Please leave us for a moment. I'll talk to her. Please. -Get down. -[scoffs] My child. Forgive your Mom. Because... I don't know where to start. I don't know how to hold you, how to talk to you, how you can understand me. But now that you're here, I just want one thing. To make you happy. It is difficult to compete against 20 years. I feel guilty. Ashamed. Because everything I did back then... failed. [crying] You don't understand, do you? Me too. I know how you feel. I love you very much. Very, very much. I've waited for you for so long. [sobbing continues] [retches] [retching] [gasps] [retching] [grunts] [grunting] The more I get to know her, the more I'm hating her. [scoffs] She is so melodramatic. Crying all the time. [sighs] She thinks... that I'll... that I'll also cry. Christine! Christine! Christine! Christine! Christine! Christine! -Ouch! Ouch! -[shushing] -Be quiet! -What? If you want my attention, you didn't have to reel me in. You could have just whistled. But, Nanny, isn't whistling to people rude? -[laughs] You have a point. -But wait... -Do you have the evidence? -Yeah! Uh-huh! Really? You see, I have this plan. But we don't have enough evidence. I, too, have a plan. No, but I have one that will make dad hate her, for good. Oh, yeah, but hate is a strong word. It is better to love than hate. If ever love is the word. -Uh-- What? -Let's go. -Ma'am, your daughter. -[Junjun grunts] [crowd cheering] [Junjun murmuring, laughs] You want to join us? You know, Val and I are good at this. We're champions at this game. -Are we not? -Mm. Go on, tell them. And in what game did you win? In playing with fire? I'm sure they're champions in that sport! Since you and your nanny came, our relationship has gone down the drain. You always have a temper. Especially with Val. Are you thinking that my foster child and I have an affair? I won't assume if I don't see anything. Mom, this girl's head is as filthy as the gutter! I know my mother's standards are high. And I won't be surprised if matrons line up before me -because I'm cute! Huh! -[scoffs] But my mom who's also your mom isn't like that. I think your brain needs to be soaked in muriatic acid to be decontaminated! -Huh? Mm! -Mm! It's our fault, my son. We didn't explain to Christine why I adopted you. As you know, I'm not his real mother. Val was given to me by his father, who trades bottles for a living. I was longing for you then, so I treated him as my own. And he grew up with me as his mother. Right! Our mother already told us that story. Months after Don Emong Goloid's death... -your ex-- -Delfin! Stop butting in! Stop it! Always talking and talking. It's cheapness! You want to play badminton? I know a place. More tasteful! More exciting! There, we will find out who is superior. [in Australian accent] You call your fans and I'll call mine. Are you game? -Do you have fans? -Yeah, down under. Down under or six feet under! Hm! [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] [cheering continues] [both] Rock, paper, scissors! Mm! Ready! Mm! [grunting] -[grunts, groans] -[Christine] Ah! -[squealing] Yes! -[crowd cheering] [panting] [crowd cheering] [grunting] Ah! [Val grunts] They lose! [cheers] [crowd cheering] [laughing] [Christine grunting] [screams] [groans] [screams] Ooh! [moans] [grunts] [grunts] [grunts] [gasps] -Ah! Ouch. -[crowd cheering] [cheering] Ah! -[Georgia] Huh? -[Nanny] Christine! -Huh? -[Georgia gasps] -[Junjun] Ma'am, your daughter! -Christine! -My child! Wake up! -[Val] Christine? Christine! Help! Help Christine! Doc, what happened to my daughter? Ma'am, she probably lacks sleep and is just getting some to regain her strength. Nah! Maybe her brain was shaken from the excessive force. -This is all your fault. -Me? Why do you always blame me for everything? If you didn't show us that you were playing badminton... This is my daughter! then we would have stayed home and watched TV! So don't you interfere! [Doctor] That's enough! Uh-- -What's the matter? -You are too noisy! -Who is? We are not noisy! -We are simply explaining! -We normally talk like this. -How will we understand...? If not for her, this would not have happened to my daughter. We should have been able to rationalize by now. So we are not loud! We are not noisy! We are not noisy! -B. -[all gasps] [Georgia] What the..! You really like hurting my daughter. I didn't mean for it to happen, -why are you blaming me? -What do you mean? Christine! Christine, hello you're back. You're awake! -Child? -Where am I? [all gasp] Oh, no! Ma'am! This is how it happens in TV. -That's amnesia! -[Georgia and Nanny] Huh? Don't you remember me? I'm Mom! Mom. [in Aussie accent] Who am I? -I told you so. It's amnesia! -You startled me. Ma'am, that is amnesia. You have to cry. -On TV, the mothers always cry. -[bawls] My dear! My daughter has amnesia! -Amnesia! -Christine! [gasps] [in Australian accent] Miss, can I use your phone please? -Oh. Sure. -[chuckles] -Who are you going to call? -Your ex-husband. Unbelievable! Really? Why? I'll tell him what you've done to his daughter. [snarls] -Hello, Jack. Hello-- -Go ahead. Utter one word to Jack... and your blood will mix with flood water. Here in Malabon! [stammers] Hey, Jack! Hey! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Bye, Jack! -[screams] -Now! You're such a meddler! -[screaming] -This is what I'll do to you. I will mince you like ground beef, those thighs and cheeks of yours! [grunts] [pants] -What now? -[shuddering] What, are you gonna tell Jack? No! No! No! -You want to try my patience? -[pants] -Not again. -Okay. I'm so glad you're that easy to talk to. Okay. Have a seat. [groans] -Okay, take a deep breath. -[inhales deeply] -And sleep tight, okay? -[exhales] -Okay? -Okay. -Good night. -Good night. [Junjun groaning] Oh! [mumbling] -Hello! -[screams] [shushes] Don't shout! Don't shout! It's just me. Nanny! [screaming] [shushing] Junjun! Quiet! Whatever you're planning to do now, think it over. Don't do things you're going to regret! Remember, you also have a sister. I don't have any. Huh? [stammers] Mother. I'm sure you have a mother. Oh, no, she's dead. Settle down. I just came in to calm myself. I'm so stressed out. I want you to give me a massage. [in Australian accent] I just want you to touch me! If you're stressed, I am more stressed than you! I have been working since daybreak. Get out of here! If you don't want me to call the drunkards down the street to beat you senseless. Why do you keep driving me away? Can't you see the point? I like you! [in Australian accent] I am just a girl, standing in front of a boy, waiting for him to love her. But... [stutters] I'm also a girl. Look. I'm gay! What are you saying? I'm gay! Oh no, you're just being artistic which is why you're so fond of pictures. Oh, no, I like them. -I like men. -No. No. Oh, it's just a phase. You'll recover. What do you take me for? The common cold? -Come, we have to do something. -[grunts] For you to know if you're truly gay. -What? -Kiss me. Yuck! You're disgusting. You're being possessed by the devil. [grunts] [groans] [sobs] The hole in your daughter's skull might have caused the amnesia. My God! My daughter's skull was fractured, doc. [gasps] But, doc, if my daughter's skull is broken, she'd be dead by now. Huh? You have a point. Oh! Who put this in here? Sorry, Ma'am. Take a look at the real x-ray of your daughter. I don't see any problem. You're giving me a heart attack! If there's nothing wrong, then why doesn't she remember anything? Maybe she's suffering from trauma. -Ah. -I'll go ahead. -I have to make rounds. -Are you really a doctor? My baby... You'll be fine. I'll do everything for you to get well again. Ah... Chew, chew, chew. [giggles] My daughter's great. You want some more? Chew, chew, chew. Mom, she has amnesia. She didn't lose her arms! Look. These are her hands. You treat her like a baby. You want to get her well again? Let's bang her head on the wall. I'll do it. Stop that! Why are you always against me? [pants] [screams, panting] [indistinct chattering, laughing] [screams] [gasping] -Christine's missing! -Huh! Why? -What? -[Junjun] How? Where? I woke up and she wasn't by my side. She has amnesia, right? Maybe she bought tamarind! And forgot to come home! Or she might have forgotten our address. Or forgot to... Breathe! [screaming] [clamoring] Where's Christine! Oh! -Uh. Chris--! -Mm! My baby? Mom? How did you know I was here? Uh... We thought that you must have missed the floods in Malabon. It's summer here now. So I figured you went to the sea. Don't worry, it will only take three spits from a bully to make it flood. Hm. Christine, don't you remember anything yet? None. If I did, I would have said it already. You know, call me selfish, but I hope it takes you a long time to heal. So I can serve you. To make up for the days, months and years that we have lost. Uh... Whether your father comes back to me or not, I have you so I'll be okay. I can lose everything I have as long as I have you here with me, I would be very happy. What kind of mother are you? How could you stay away from us for so long? My child, it was not my choice. Do you know the word unlucky? That was what happened to me. I did all that I can... But I was out of luck. No. You didn't do everything. Because if you did, something would have happened. [indistinct chatter] Christine. -Hey, what are you doing here? -[screams] -Nothing. [sobs] -Nothing? You're crying, aren't you? -No, I'm not. -You definitely are! -Not a chance! -Let me see. What is this, spit? I don't know what has gotten into me. And then I cried. And I can't stop and I don't even know why. Perhaps you've become insane. You have no business here. Just go inside. Leave me alone. Hush now, Christine. Here, I have a hankie you can use. I had the nerve to offer when I don't have a hankie with me. -You can take this instead. -[sighs] Here. -[blowing] -Uh... Mm-hmm. [groans] Thanks. It's a bit sticky. [chuckles] [laughs] There, there. You know, you and your mother have much alike. Both of you are crybabies. Christine, your daddy called, we are leaving tomorrow. Huh? But wait, what did he say? But I don't want to go back to Melbourne! -Hah! I caught you! -[gasps] I knew it! How did you know that we lived in Melbourne? Did I say that we lived in Melbourne? I didn't say anything about living in Melbourne! Who told you that we lived in Melbourne? -Nanny! Nanny! -Did I say anything? Did you read in the newspapers that we lived in Melbourne? Aha! You were playing pretend! -You were fooling me! -Be quiet! They'll hear you. How could you? How could you do such a do! I was the one who raised you, put you to sleep, fed you, and now you deceive me. You were pretending to have amnesia! -You should have told me. -Shush up, nanny! Be quiet. I had to get some evidence. I only did what I had to do. Stop this nonsense! But nanny! Your mother is a good person! You proved that yourself! Why do you want to stop your parents from getting back together? Your mother never left you, you were taken away from her. And if you begin to feel yourself loving your mom, don't stop it! [Val] What's this? It doesn't suit me, Jo. And it smells. Jo, it smells bad! Why do we need to dress up like this? [Georgia] Because Christine uses her video camera all the time. So when Jack sees us, we will be decent. [Jojo] Okay. That's fine. Mom, we're at home and I need to wear a barong? Jo, where did you get this thing? -From Funeraria La Paz. -You got this from the funeral? A dead guy wore this and you're letting me use it? -[Jojo] No. -Why don't I just clobber you? It's seems like it's been washed. It seems? -It smells good. -No, that was washed. It looks good on you. Look at you, my daughter will definitely approve. [laughs] Enough with the teasing! [clears throat] Baby, I didn't know you were awake. Um, actually I'm really bored. Can we go on a tour? Okay, I'll go and change. Oh, no, Mom, don't bother. Your clothes are fine. -Ha? -Especially yours, Val. It suits you well. Really? [giggles] Ooh. [talking indistinctly] This is the place! This is it! -Friend, we are already here. -What's the matter? You know very well that it is my dream to look like my daughter. So I brought her along! I want us to look alike. That's easy. Just look at your daughter, friend. Darling, not me. She's Christine. -This is your daughter? -Yes, that's the one. -Are you sure? -I'm sure. You want me to demonstrate her delivery? What are saying? They will be styling us. Hey, guys, this is my daughter. Really? -[clamoring] -Mom! Mom! -[Christine] Enough, enough! -Why? Do you doubt me? [talking indistinctly] My God! [stylist grunting] [both laughing] -[Jojo laughs] -[Georgia screaming] -[Jojo] Look at her having fun. -Mom. I hope we're next. [laughing] [screaming, laughing] Junjun! [laughing] [Jojo] I'm having so much fun! I didn't know Mall of Asia is so huge! -I'll carry you. -Thank you, girl. Ow! -Ah. -What's wrong? -I got something in my eye. -Huh? I want to get out of here. We are always at the mall. I want to go out of town. Come quick! I'm so excited! -I'll be right with you. -Okay. Why is it taking so long? Let's go! [all cheering] -Bye! -Bye! Woo! Come back! Why am I left alone? Who do I go with? I wanna be with my daughter. Ah! Hurry! Hey! Mister! MIster, lets go over there! MIster! Let's go over there. Mister, what's wrong? Hey! We're supposed to go that way! [indistinct chatter] This is great! [water running] -Nice, isn't it? -Wow! [Christine] Ooh. [Christine] Hmm. Ooh. Ooh! [crying] Mister? Ah! Ah! [screaming] [Georgia screaming] [squeals] Ah! [screaming] -[Nanny] Thank you. -Where's Mom? Guys, where's Mom? [laughs] -My baby. -Where have you been? -Auntie... -I went for a stroll. -You seem awfully sweaty. -What happened to you? -[Val] Are you okay, Mom? -I'm... It's sweat. Are you okay? -That's sweat? -I'm okay. -[laughs] -[Christine] Yeah? -I'm okay. -Are you sure? I'm sure. Christine, let's go home. What are you thinking? Nothing special. -I'm just confused. -What about? With Mommy. And us. You're not supposed to be confused. When you go back to Australia, you will eventually forget me. Wait. So you mean-- We can't be together. I know. You are heaven, I am earth. You are classy, I am cheap. You are imported and I am native. I wish you can forget all of these so I can be confident when I'm with you. You don't seem to need it. In other things, but not with you. [inhales] Christine, don't! What? [stutters] Why? I'm not yet ready for these kind of things. [breathes sharply] Hm! You're so quick to give up! [Delfin humming a tune] A pleasant good evening, Georgia! -Flowers for you! -Oh. No, thanks. No, I'm just kidding. Uh, Delfin, you know, I am allergic to flowers. Like my love for you. Plastic? Those will last forever. Goodness, Delfin, go on home. -My daughter might see you. -Mm? I don't want her thinking that I flirt with younger men. And most of all, a badminton instructor. But why? Georgia, I love you very much. I swear, I will marry you in all churches! Right now! -Georgia. -Delfin, if I am to marry somebody, it will be Christine's father. He is my one and only love. So you better get going because I have other things to do. Go on. [Delfin grunts] Remember this, Georgia. If you won't be mine... -Then what? -Nothing. -[chuckles] -What a drama king. Go home, and close the gate. Hm! Psst! Christine! Why? ♪ I know something you don't know ♪ ♪ If persuaded, I'll tell you ♪ What's that? It's about your mother. She has a secret. You will finally stop your video-nonsense once you find out about this. Tell your father as soon as possible. Something bad about my mom? Vile and heinous. Georgia Quizon? Ah! Madam Georgia. Why, what's the problem? Chief, this is Madam Georgia's daughter. She wants to know if you have a record of her mother. Wasn't Madam Georgia imprisoned here in 1990? What do you want to know? Madam Georgia was not proven guilty of homicide. Homicide? My mommy killed somebody? It was Don Emong Goloid. The old man your mother married. She married another man? Delfin, those are the rumors that went around. Do you have files that prove my mother's imprisonment? -Andres, get the files. -Yes, sir. Here they are. -Here, look. -See? Your mother's a killer. Dad, you have a lot to learn about the woman you're about to get back together with who happens to be my mother. You mustn't go on with this because of the following: She is fond of young men who are old enough... -[Jack] What? -...to be her son. -[Jack] No... -There. And you know what? -To top it all off, -Oh. she's a criminal. Oh. She killed an old man, who she married a long time ago to have lots of money. Oh no. Oh, yeah? No worries. Georgia is truly, honestly, certainly, sincerely excited to see you. What's the matter? What's that? It's Jack. -Jack? -Yes, Jack. -It's Jack! -[squeals] -Jack! -[laughs] He tells me that he is coming here as soon as possible. [all squealing] -Tomorrow. -[squealing] -What else did he say? -What? What? And he says that it's important for him to see you! [screams] Let me talk to him! And he also says that he needs to hold you because he heard a lot of new things about you. [squealing] Don't you give that woman the phone. Miss you, miss you. I'm excited! -And my waiting is awesome. -Oh, yeah? Oh yeah. Georgia is very, very excited because you know what? She's very, very much in love with you. And I'm very, very excited too. [screams] Hello, Jack. [imitates dial tone] Can I borrow? -Hello, Jack. -Bye, Nanny. He's gone. Oops! You'll be seeing him tomorrow! [cheering] But you still weren't able to talk to him. You're right. But that's okay. I'll cook. We will cook! We will make a feast! [squeals] Jack is coming! Jack is coming! Where is it? Hmm? Here it is. [chuckles] Hey, that's me! Hi! Christine, I'm sorry I took your video cam. I have something I need to say but I don't have the courage to say it in person. You know what, ma'am? I'm in love with you already. Even if I'm only a fish sauce factory worker. But I hope your heart can be humbled by my handsome physique. Was I able to record that? [Christine] Dad, I just want you to know that I'm doing this for you. [chuckles] That's why I'm going to give you a hundred and one reasons why you shouldn't marry this woman. Dad, number one, she is not, I mean, not at all good looking. I mean, come on, she's not gonna look good next to you. Number two, she is fond of young men that are old enough to be her son. -[Georgia] Shut your mouth. -Mom! Your spit shouldn't mix with the food. Mom, listen to me. Mom, don't be depressed. Don't be shocked. Mom, don't be hurt. -Don't be depressed. -Then slice the carrots. Mom, and don't cry. Will you stop it! I have my hands full. I'm very busy now. Mom, you have to see this. Can't you see I have a lot to do? Wash this. -Excuse me. Excuse. -Ah! Mom, please go watch this. I got to know something about your daughter. Hey! I'm really busy right now! -Don't make me... -I'll do it. I'll do it. Mom, just watch the tape! Your daughter is fooling you! Val! This is not the time for your jokes. -More lies? -[scoffs] Stop that. If you want to help, help me with this. If you don't want to, then get out. But wash this first. [sighs] Emong, the first and only man in my life is coming back for me. Many thanks to you. I didn't intend what had happened between us, but you are the reason why my family and I will finally be whole again. Thank you for your money. Though there had been rumors that I killed you, I was able to clear my name because they weren't really true. I am forever thankful and indebted to you. We're married. But only in paper. [chuckles] You weren't even able to experience my charms. Emong, if you're listening, I'm very thankful to you. [door closes] Emong? Emong, you don't have to say anything. I get it. I scare easily, you see. [yells] Why? You surprised me! Nanny come with me to the airport! But why? They already fetched your daddy. -I need to talk to him. -Come on! -Before he sees mommy. -You talk too much. [Junjun] There he is! Oh my! Ma'am! Jack is already here! [drums playing] [marching band playing] I do. I do. I do. -[Junjun squeals] -[Georgia] He's here. Jack! WAIKIKI, Jack! I waited for so long for your return. I miss you. INDIA! Let's go inside. I am pissed. Huh? But-- Whoa! Whoa! Stop everyone! This is a hijack! You again? Uh, this is a hold up! -So? -Uh-- -I will kill him! -I don't care! [bangs] [marching band playing] [Georgia] Come with me. Let's go upstairs. He's an addict. [hostage taker] Ouch! Ah! Jack, I cannot understand-- -Christine. Why? -Christine is not here. -Christine! Jack, Christine is out. Mom, may I go out, out. I don't believe you. You probably killed her. Jack, IMUS and BALIWAG too! I Miss U Sweetheart. Beauty And Love I Will Always Give. QUIAPO! Quiet U I Am Pissed Off. Huh? DUBAI, Jack. DUBAI! Don't you believe I am yours? -I am yours? -Huh? [Christine] Nanny, hurry up! [Christine] I just want you to know that I'm doing this for you. I would have save you for making another mistake. So, that's why I'm going to give you 101 reasons why you shouldn't marry this woman. See, Mom. That's what I've been telling you about! From your admirable daughter. [gasps] Let's go, Christine. Dad, wait, let me explain. Is this the reason why you came? So you can prove that I am good-for-nothing? Didn't I tell you everything? Why won't you believe me? I didn't want for us to part. God knows I did everything I could. But all through my difficulties, I never blamed anyone. You asked me once why I never did anything for us to be reunited. You! You! [sobbing] Did you do anything for you to see me? I'm not selfish, Christine. You! You are the one who does not know how to love! [sobbing] You're the one who is good-for-nothing. Let's go, Christine. Jack! IRAN! It's your loss. Hm! Mom. -[sobbing] -[Christine] Mom. [Val] What are you still doing here? Get out! Ask her to forgive me. -Have pity, Val. -Have pity? You should suffer! -[Val grunts] -Val-- [sobbing] [knocking on door] -Yes, baby? -Dad. I have to talk to you about something. I have to confess something about Mom. I've had enough, Christine. I don't want to hear anymore. But, Dad, it's all my fault. I did everything to make you angry at her. Why? Because I thought she left us. That she planned not to follow us to Australia. That she didn't love me. But, I didn't know that she moved heaven and earth just to be with us, Dad. I was wrong. And you were right. She's the most wonderful woman in the world. A unique mother. An exceptional mother. And I'm very, very proud to say... -My mother is so cute. -[laughs] [Christine laughs] Hmm. Oh, Georgia, forgive me. I badmouthed you to your daughter. Where is she? Where is she? I will right my mistakes! [stutters] I only did that because I was so jealous of your Australian boyfriend. Because you turned me down. Georgia, Georgia my love. Forget it. My family is gone. And Delfin, nobody gets a Best Actor award for over acting! You can eat now. You mean it? You're really something. [music playing] [indistinct murmuring] -Val, what is that? -Huh? Mom. [Christine] Mom. Mom. [grunts] [music stops] Georgia, please forgive your daughter. [woman 2] Please. They want us to help. They're begging for forgiveness. Go on. So we can ask for imported chocolate. [woman 2] That's right, Madam Georgia. I'm very, very sorry, Georgia. I was wrong. PIER Georgia! PIER! Please Ignore Everything, Right? TIANGGE! Correct! You acted like a moron. -[Georgia] Hm! -Mom. It was all my fault. I am the one you should punish. Dad didn't do anything wrong. He loves you very much. Christine, what I shall say is not scripted. I, personally, am the one who wrote this. Now, I am facing all of you as a leader. I am accepting the challenge. I am ready. I have said this before and I will say it again. I am a gracious lady, but don't push me too hard. However... I have been pushed too hard. My values and my family are intact. I love you, Mom. Now what? What are you all still doing here? Go away! Val? You too? I thought you loved me. I... -never... -[crowd] Huh? -said... -[crowd] Huh? -that... -[crowd] Huh? -I... -[crowd] Huh? -loved... -[crowd] Huh? you. [crowd murmuring] [Junjun] Uh, pardon us. [stammers] You may go. Georgia is angry. Go. Go there. Go. I'm so sorry. [Junjun talking indistinctly] Excuse us. Maybe some other time. Go on. Get out. I'm so sorry. You there. Who are you? I am Super Binggo. Why are you here? And so? I was just wondering. I've been looking for my mother for 23 years. But you, you already have your daughter. All that is left now are hugs and kisses. Why don't you do it? Time is too important to waste. It's better when there's a father, there's a mother, there's a child. Are you 23 years old? I'm only ten. You said you have been looking for your mother for 23 years? Where did the 13 years come from? Overtime. Mm! Why didn't I think of that? Mm. [woman on PA speaking] -There! -[pants] -Oh my! Auntie! -Yes. Auntie, why are you here? Yes, do you know how badly I need to get there? -You know my story, right? -Yes. My daughter is about to leave me again. Auntie, the plane is now leaving. Really? Okay, I'm coming. Auntie! Auntie, you're not allowed to pass. -Forgive me, you can't. -What now? No... All your mother's debts are cleared. -Okay. Let her in. -Mom, hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! [pants] -Wow! -That's the spirit! [woman on PA speaking] Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Ah! Ah! -[screams] -[Val] Junjun! -[Delfin] Georgia, my love! -[Val] Mom! They haven't boarded yet. They're still here. Yes, there. [Val] Christine! -[gasps] -Mom... Honey! -[Nanny laughing] -Huh? [laughs] [Nanny] She's so cute. -[Nanny] Like you, Junjun. -Look at her. [all laughing] [groaning] [bells ringing] Hmm. [guests cheering, applauding] [smooches] [Georgia giggles] -Take a picture of us. -[laughing] -Congrats, Mom. -Take a picture of us! -[Val] Congratulations. -[Christine] Daddy! -[Jack] Thank you. -Daddy, congratulations! Congratulations! [talking indistinctly, laughing] -Thank you. -[Jack] Thank you. [Nanny] Kiss! Kiss! -How about a kiss? -[chuckles] -Mm! -[laughing] Kiss me. Mm.
