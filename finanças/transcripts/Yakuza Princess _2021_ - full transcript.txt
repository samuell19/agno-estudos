You wouldn't say this if your grandfather were here. Akemi... have I taught you nothing all these years? The outside world doesn't fit in the dojo. Sorry, sensei. When your grandfather brought you to me, you had just turned six. - I still remember that day. -So do I. You have the vocation to become a true warrior. But to fulfill it, you must leave your grief and anger... I'm trying, sensei. It's just... so hard. Take a look at your shinai. It doesn't weep for the dead. It doesn't feel guilt. Let discipline shape your spirit and mind. You and your sword must become one. (dramatic music playing) Chiba: Allow this principle to guide you in your journey. It's what your grandfather wanted, Akemi. Kamae! Posture. Focus. Concentration. Nothing must stand between you and your sword. - (breathes deeply) - Your life may depend on one blow. A single blow. Strike like I taught you. (in Japanese) Now! (dramatic music playing) (grunts) (upbeat music playing) (in Japanese) Again!

Tomorrow you need to take the day shift. I have an appointment in the morning. - Hey. I finished reading it. - Did you like it? Samara: (scoffing) Barely understood a thing. I should have put you on a dating app. Now, that would've been a far better way of learning Portuguese. - How about you? - Dating? Oh. I haven't been able to think straight since... I'm sorry. I'm actually done with all this. I wanna leave. I gotta go, I'm gonna be late for class. See you tomorrow, okay? (dramatic music playing) Akemi: (in Japanese) Good night, Grandpa. (gasps) Doctor: (in Portuguese) I don't have all the test results, but memory loss is common after this kind of trauma. Man: (in Portuguese) He doesn't remember anything? Doctor: No. All we've managed to find out is that he's a foreigner. He could be American, English, who knows. We've reached out to all the embassies, consulates... Nobody knows who he is. He's a ghost. - (exhales deeply) - Doesn't even remember his own name. Shall we? (in English) How do you feel? - Okay. - Look... these officers are investigating your case. They brought something here to help you - remember what happened. - Okay. (suspenseful music playing) When they found you, you were holding this sword. You were wounded by it. Never seen it.

(in Japanese) Nothing happened. I was the one who introduced him to the family. And you dealt with him, didn't you? - What did you talk about? - He admitted to embezzlement. He wanted assurances that his mother wouldn't face any retribution. (in Japanese) I just lost two men! Don't you think this calls for an explanation? Takeshi, our organization has rules. How much do you want? Huh? Tell me. This isn't about money, Takeshi-san. What I'm saying is you can't just murder - my men on a whim! - I don't owe any loyalty to you. No, not to me. But you do the family! And to the Oyabun! (dramatic music playing) This is for the Oyabun. A token of my loyalty. Don't be so dramatic. You are one of my best lieutenants. I've never had a single reason to doubt you. Oyabun, are you saying this man should be trusted? He's always done what he wanted without any consequences. Who do you think you're talking to? Who do you think you are, you punk? I've served this clan for decades! Only because I spared your life long ago! Watch your mouth. Worthless bastard. Watch your step. Watch your step. (siren wailing) (indistinct chatter) Couple more of these and you can join the Yakuza. What is it, anyway? A moncho. My grandpa was carrying this embroidery when he died. When they shot him.

I don't understand a word you're fucking saying, pal. (in English) Oh. Oh. - Well, uh, what do you want? - Man: The sword. Tell me about it. Uh. It's a... - It's a... it's a katana. - Man: Yeah. Uh, may I? Huh. Yes. It's pretty ordinary, if you ask me. Well, I could make you an offer, but I'll tell you straight off, it ain't gonna be much. Why don't you just tell me about the sword? Here. Here's, uh, 1,500. US, cash. (chuckles) You don't understand. All right, I'll... Yeah, here, um, we can, uh, we can make a trade, you know? You know what I'm saying? A guy like you... walking around the city with a katana like that. People are gonna notice. (chuckling) You know what, I got something a little bit less conspicuous. Here. Look at that. Hey? Anything interest you? Vintage. World War II. Lots of stuff to choose from here. Man: No. You still don't understand. You know what, buddy? I think you're the one who's not getting it. Why don't you take the money, get the fuck out of my store before I call the cops? (grunts, groans) (suspenseful music playing) The sword. Get it off me, please. (gasps) - The sword. - All right, all right. This Japanese guy comes in here not too long ago. He wanted some maintenance done on the blade. So I sent him to a specialist to get it sharpened. That's all I know, I swear to God. - Go on. - (grunts) It's a Muramasa. Very ancient. Very rare. It's supposed to be cursed. It imprisons souls, bloodthirsty. All that Japanese mumbo jumbo shit. (breathes sharply) People are gonna pay a lot of money for this blade. I don't know who they are. I'm pretty sure they're connected to the Japanese mob. You know, the Yakuza. The Japanese man. - What's his name? - (breathing sharply) I don't know his name. But I got an address. (soft music playing) (dramatic music playing) This is the bottle you were planning to open today, remember? "When you turn 21..." (pouring) (in Japanese) Grandpa. I'm finally 21.

(coughing) Aki! (breathes heavily) What were you doing in my apartment? I need your help. The sword. Is it your father's? My grandfather. No, he didn't own a sword. I need to talk to him. He's dead. That's a pretty deep cut. - Yeah. - Clean it. I'll look for something to disinfect it with. (dramatic music playing) Akemi: Sensei. Are these my parents? Is this me? SUMMER 1999 Who are these people? This man in the picture. He tried to kill me. I think he's Yakuza. Sensei? Your grandfather asked me to keep these. Are you even listening? - Someone tried to kill me! - I can't help you. You need to talk to someone else. Mrs. Tsugahara. My boss? Chiba: This blade can be treacherous. The katana has found you. You and it are one now. As you were meant to be. Go. Now. Your life depends on it. (door opening, closing) Where is she? I said, "Where is she?" Are you going to kill me? (suspenseful music playing) Akemi! How long did you and Grandpa have this relationship? Mrs. Tsugahara: Eight years. Eight years. And all this time he never told you anything? He never talked about his past. You know that. Daisuke made me keep our affair a secret, no one knew about it. Well, Chiba did. But I never thought that... That he would have such... t-- terrible fate. You know? I was devastated, but I knew something was wrong. - Daisuke was acting strange lately. - Strange how? He told me that the day was coming when you two would disappear. I... I thought it was some kind of excuse. I couldn't believe him. Remember the trip he took before... you know... before what happened? (sighs) Before he left, he gave me this address. He told me to keep it safe. They will have answers there. (dramatic music playing) CORONER Man: Hey! (in Portuguese) Hold it right there. (groans) (gunshot) (suspenseful music playing) Akemi: I don't know how I can help you. Man: Yeah? Well, I don't have another option. Akemi: Don't you remember anything from before the hospital? No. Not my face, not my name, only the sword. Listen, I don't want to give you any kind of hope. I'm grateful for your help, but this katana doesn't have anything to do with my grandfather. He was... just an old man. Harmless. There are no harmless old men. (dramatic music playing) (door opening) (in Japanese) You are not welcome here. (in Japanese) Come with me. Tell your friend to wait here. What did she say? I'll be back in a bit. No, thanks. Okay. (soft music playing) (in Japanese) Do you think it was the Muramasa? (grunts) (grunts) Man: Oh. - Very nice. - (both laugh) Wait here. (door opening) Akemi: (in Japanese) My grandfather was here before he died. (in Japanese) Your grandfather came here for the Muramasa. Akemi: What do you mean? He had asked me to keep it for him. Akemi: This man tried to kill me. Is he the one who murdered my grandfather? Was he after the katana? The Muramasa? - The man isn't after the katana. - What does he want with me then? Listen... carefully, girl. We were all friends with your grandfather. I'd like to help you, but I can't do it alone. I can't answer all your questions on my own. If you and my grandfather were friends, then you must know something. Why are you all being so secretive? There is no secrecy. Then why... Come with me. Get some rest. You still have a long journey ahead of you, girl. Oh. (grunts) (breathes heavily, chuckling) What is he doing? (in Japanese) His clan was decimated. This is the only way he can preserve his honor. He prefers not to die by his enemies' hands. Fucking hell. (samurai groaning) In the age of the samurai, honor was everything. Unlike today. Men would risk their lives to kill one another. (grunts) (chuckles) It was a time of bravery. There were heroes. (old man chuckles) - The katana... - Shut up, Saito. The katana your friend is carrying is a real Muramasa. (grunts) - Ma'am? - Yes? Did you know my grandfather? He was our friend. He never told me about this place. No one ever talks about this place outside of here. That's the rule. Call me when you finish your bath. Every swing of a blade forged by Muramasa, the master swordsmith, has a demon lurking within. The spirits of the many who were slain by a Muramasa dwell in the sword... waiting for the next victim to feast on their blood. (in Japanese) Like the devil. (music intensifies) (soft music playing) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) Yukiko: I'll come by later with your clean clothes and something to eat. My apologies, ma'am. You may call me Yukiko. Thank you. (chuckles) I'm afraid the sake got the best of your friend. Genjuro and Saito are taking care of him. (chuckles) Take this time to get some rest. - (yelling) - (exclaims) (indistinct chatter) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music playing) Saito: What do we do with him? When the man arrives, he'll decide what to do. (thunder continues rumbling) You can't sleep, can you? Get dressed... and follow me. (suspenseful music playing) Some secrets we carry to the grave... but others end up dying with us, stuck in our throats. But the past... almost always catches up to us when we least expect. Sometimes, even a past we forgot... or wanted to forget. Even a past... that doesn't belong to us. (eerie music playing) (thunder rumbling) Akemi: Ren Oshima. 1947 - 1999 Grandpa? How could this be? (thunder rumbling) (Akemi grunting) (emotional music playing) MASSACRE IN OSAKA TAKIKAWA CLAN BOSS BRUTALLY MURDERED ALONG WITH HIS FAMILY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER MISSING (dramatic music playing) (footsteps approaching) (coughs) (exhales heavily) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music playing) (grunts) (in English) That sword. It tasted my blood already. I protected your family... and saved you, Aki. - (in English) My name isn't Aki. - (indistinct chatter) (footsteps approaching) Takeshi: We need to get out of here. Why would I trust you? (in Japanese) Because you don't have anyone else. I'm all you have. (men grunting) (suspenseful music playing) (thunder rumbling) (man grunting) (man grunting) (insects chirping) - (grunts) - (men grunting) (grunts) (gunshots) (gunshots) (ominous music playing) - (grunts) - (both grunt) (in Japanese) So this is where you cowards and lackeys from the Takikawa clan came to hide? What a pity. A garbage dump where honor and righteousness have rotted away. (chuckles) Kojiro: What's so funny? - Huh? - (laughs) (in Japanese) The very thought of a man like you speaking of honor. You, a butcher of women and children! (laughs) Kojiro: You got lucky, old man. I don't need to chat with you any longer. (Takeshi panting) (gunshots) (man grunts) - (grunts) - (gunshot) - (pants) - (grunts) - (both grunt) - (car engine starting) (in English) We can't just leave him! Takeshi: (in English) You still don't understand, do you? (grunts) Takeshi: He's the man who killed Ren Oshima, your grandfather. (gasping) (dramatic music playing) There's a shochi bottle and a piece of cloth in the glove compartment. Ren Oshima, or Daisuke, as you call him, wasn't your grandfather. (somber music playing) (grunts) Takeshi: He was my right-hand man, AKki. (groaning) He left his own family behind to honor his duty. He was my family. Your father, Akira Takikawa, was the most feared man in Osaka. (sighs) A man like him... has his share of enemies. A gang chief called Ken'ichi, who's my boss now, was growing inside the organization, conspiring, convincing some other bosses that your father was weak. (grunts) Your father didn't believe it when I tried to warn him. On your first birthday... Oyabun Ken'ichi and his goon Kojiro set up a trap. Your whole family was killed. Your father, your mother... your brother. Ren was the only one I could trust. I pretended to pledge loyalty to Oyabun Ken'ichi and waited for Ren to get in contact all these years. But I only found out where he'd taken you - after he was killed. - They told me he was mugged. Takeshi: Ren would never be killed in a robbery, Aki. Oyabun Ken'ichi hired a hitman. The idea was to kill you both. But that man saved my life. Takeshi: I don't know what game he's playing. Maybe he's planning to use you as a hostage. I don't know, Aki. Takeshi-san. Call me Akemi. (dramatic music playing) 3 (man singing in Japanese) & Oyabun Ken'ichi knows the risk you represent. There are still men loyal to your family, - willing to fight for you. - This is your war. Not mine. This is your father's war. And Ren"s... - who sacrificed himself for you. - Maybe he changed his mind. Maybe he would have asked what I wanted. War is the only way. It's your fate. Maybe he really wanted to bury his past. The past would come knocking. No one, Akemi.. No one is capable of burying their past. I won't be trapped by a past that isn't my own. Look around, Akemi. Look at these people. This despicable place. You weren't born to live here. You belong in Japan. (indistinct chatter) Akemi. (ominous music playing) (indistinct chatter) (dramatic music playing) (sobs) (footsteps approaching) (suspenseful music playing) Why? Why what? He didn't do anything. I didn't do this. (grunts) (both grunt) Calm down. - (grunts) - (grunts) Stop! (Man panting) (grunts) (yells) (both grunting) (Man coughing, breathing heavily) You killed my grandfather. Do it. Don't. Don't. This man is a killer, Akemi. A hitman. (in Japanese) He's a ronin. Akemi: (in Japanese) Here, among the dead... This is where his journey ends. He's not worthy of dying by the blade of the Muramasa.
