- [Voiceover] Good morning, it's seven A.M., it's bright and it's beautiful, and you are listening to 1120 the city, on your AM dial, the quail hunt opened this morning at first dawn, game warden Peterson will be joining us shortly to discuss the possibility of raising the quail limit from six birds to seven. And as always, the phone lines will be wide open for your questions, opinions, and suggestions. And we thank you for listening, I'm Mr. Pitts, and you're listening to 1120 the city. (sizzle) (quiet pop song) (radio announcer speaks in Spanish) (laughs) (speaks Spanish) (ocean sounds) - [Voiceover] They say the "meltemi," a northeastern wind, makes life bearable here. (sighs) - Are you a retard? - What? - Simple enough question, isn't it? Are you retarded? - Look, guy, I didn't mean any harm by it, so... - You're a real tub-a-shit, aren't you? - Oh, okay. - (chuckles) You're gonna agree with me? Listen, don't touch it, look, get the hell off my porch before I start kickin' ya. Here! This isn't even mine! (pop music) - Bob-bert. (whispering) - I'm selling encyclopedias. Are you interested in obtaining additional knowledge? Sir? - What? - Encyclopedias, I'm selling them. Do you currently own a set? - Nope. - What's your name? - Webster. - [Voiceover] Like, the dictionary? - Sure. - Listen, I'm a traveling salesman by morning, I run a boxing gym downtown during the day, I dabble in a little bit of everything, all in pursuit of financial independence, and my name's Jester, by the way. - Kinda like the playing cards? Where do you live? - Next door, friend, I live with my grandfather. He's the mayor. - Your grandpa's the mayor? - Was, not anymore. He owns the Dodgers. - The Los Angeles Dodgers? - Did, not anymore. - You really selling encyclopedias? - You really folding clothes inside of a treehouse? Is that Robert's gun? - Maybe. - It is. I sneak over and steal it out of the garage on occasion, shoot a squirrel or bird. Shot a fat man who lives across the street a couple months ago. - You shot a squirrel? - You like sail boats? - No. - Why? - I don't really care about boats. They don't interest me, kinda hate 'em. - You think you've forgotten what it's like to be 13? - Yeah, probably have. - It's hard. - Buena... Oh my go-to-heck, there's a young gentleman in our tree. Wonder what he's doin'... Who do you reckon he is? Is that my, hammer? - I'll bet he's hungry, why don't you go out and see if he'll come in for a snack, and a glass of milk? - [Webster] These look very ripe. I'm gonna stick to the small ones. I'll hit the rest later. You have a very soft forehead. Thank you. I'll clear up my cup. - Hey! I just got off the telephone with the mayor, and he informed me that as along as your tree house doesn't need water or sewer hookup, then you're fine-- - Wanna go to the store? - Yeah! So, don't you have a job? - I used to, but I quit. - What'd you do? - Sold copy machines. - Yeah, I did that for a couple years. Didn't pan out for me, either. You know, you don't seem 27. - Yeah? Well, uh, why do you live with your grandpa? - Parents are divorced. - Well, so you live with your grandpa? - Just staying here until they get things sorted out. - What sort of things? - Custody, mostly. Dad's a lawyer, played triple-A baseball for about eight years, but he quit just before I was born, so I never did see him play. So, why'd you sell copy machines? - 'Cause I dropped out of college. Almost got married once. - Yeah, me too. - What happened? - Found out she was two-timing me, so I cut her loose. What about you? - Day before the wedding, she, called it off. - Hmm. You have the cake ordered? - Yep. Oh, put that in. - So what'd they do with it? - What'd they do with what? - The cake? - You know what, I don't know. I've never really thought about that. - Hey, I have a baseball game tomorrow. You should come watch. - Yeah, I really don't have time for baseball games. - It's only a three minute bike ride. It's a block and a half away. Hit the cycle last year. - That's nice. - You even know what a cycle is? - Who's that? - [Voiceover] Who? - The guy in the boat? - [Voiceover] That's our mailman. - [Voiceover] Doesn't he have like a normal mail jeep? - Just a bike and trailer. - That doesn't concern you? I see like a purple one, but, uh, I don't... Oh, hold it. What do you say? Can I use this one? Cool. Can I get some of that water? Sure got a lot of pills. - When you get old, you get lots of pills, that's just the way it goes. - I'm sure Buena will top you off. (hammering) Hey! I'm your neighbor! You going running?! Hi! I'm your neighbor! That's really good, what is it? - Malted coffee. Brewed it myself. - It's delicious. So, uh, who lives in that house over there? - Bethany Marie Oglebee, though she goes by Beth and her husband lives in a submarine. - Her last name's Oglebee? - Yup. Got some errands to run, you interested? - Can't. - [Voiceover] Started today? - Yep. Buena drew me a bubble bath, so I soaked a little longer than I planned. Plumb outta time. (playful music) - I was wondering if you could do me a small favor, if it's not too much of a problem? Will you let me take a look at my mail? Oh. Okay, thanks, and maybe you could take it back so I don't have to jog with it? Bye. - Bye. - I'm awful sorry, red, but this town's only big enough for one outlaw. See ya later, sardine. (pop) (pop music) One. Light and star kick! Light and star kick! Hai-ju-ju-ju-ju! Hai-ku-lu-kick! Hello, again! - Hi. - Hi. You got a really nice yard. Do you fertilize? - No. - Really good soil then? - I guess so. - Uh, I seem to have dropped my ball, I was wondering if you could maybe help me out with that? - Um, it's right there, you could... - Yeah, I sorta can't get out of the tree. - Why not? - Well, if you'd come over here, and I can tell you. - Sure. - Sorry, I usually never-ever miss, but... Oh and my sweeper too, I got carpet so... (slow rock music) So, your husband lives in a submarine? - No, he's in the Peace Corps. - Why would anyone wanna be in the Peace Corps? - So how do you know Dwayne and Buena? - I don't, I just use all their stuff. - Well, why are you here? - Well, I used to live in their house, my family and I, but we uh, moved away when I was 12 so... Now I live here. - Field in a tree house? - Well, it's more of a tree home, but, yeah. - So how long you gonna be here for? - As long as it takes. - As long as what takes? - Probably just 'til the end of the Summer. - K. Who's Robert? - Uh, probably Dwayne's son? (sweet music) - Mr. Mailman... - [Voiceover] Mr. Mailman, I would find pleasure in taking a meeting with you. I live in the back yard, in the tree house, and I look forward to your visit. (Jester mumbles) - Hello! Hey, you're welcome to come on back here! - That was odd. - Do you know his name? - No. You know there are a lot more rules to this dartboard game than I thought. I always thought you just stood back a ways, and threw the dart at the board. Turns out there's a bit more to it than just that. - Look at this. Hey! You can come hang out! - That too was odd. He's not just a postman. - He's a genius. (pop) - Aha, ow, ow! Ow, ow... - It wasn't a bee. - Was it a hornet, or, like a wasp? - Nope. - Was it a scorpion? - It was a BB gun. - How many times did he pump it? How many times? - You can't deliver mail in your underwear. - Well I sure as hell can't deliver mail with a hole in my uniform. - You can't? - I probably could. But I won't. - Oh boy. - Webster! - You don't fight little kids! What now, genius? It's unmarked. - [Mailman] Yeah, but it was see, the tag must have just fallen off of it. - Should we open it? - Yeah. - I say no. - What's your name? - Peter. What's yours? - Webster. - My name is Jester. - Hey, they all end in "T-E-R". This is for you. - [Voiceover] Do you want this back? - I see that laminated card, you've given yourself a rule. One hour per day outside of the treehouse. - That's right. - I say we only open that box if... (sighs) I love that woman. - So do I. - Me too. (crack) (crowd noise and plucky music) Alright, let's go, Jester! Make him give you a good one. - [Voiceover] Alright, Jester! - [Voiceover] Focus in, focus in you're like a tractor beam! - [Umpire] Strike! - [Voiceover] Okay, well you'll get the next one! - Strike two! - [Voiceover] Don't swing at everything! Don't swing at everything! - Strike three, he's out! - Okay, next time. Next time. I thought he was gonna be a lot better than this. - Jester? How are you? - Lot of ins, lot of outs, lot of what have yous. - Did you do that? - Well yeah, but, it was in your flower garden, I tried to fix it but it was already broken. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. - So what do you think about our newest neighbor? - Yeah, he lives in a tree house. You met him? - Yes I have. - Where you off to? - Grocery store. - Would you pick me up a half dozen parsnips? - Sure. - Oh, Mrs. Oglebee? - Yeah? - Have you heard from Wade? - No. - I bet it won't be long now. - I hope not. - [Voiceover] See ya. (crickets chirp) - Do you really not like sail boats? - What are you talking about? - When we first met, I asked you if you liked sailboats and you, said they didn't interest you. - They're okay, I guess. They just, they don't have a motor or anything. - I've ordered the seawind 998. The fastest model I could find. When I'm finished, we should take it up the reservoir and race it. - I can't. It's too far away. Never be able to get back in time. - Oh, that's right. Sometimes I forget about your rule. - I guess, you could show it to me sometime, you know, if, when you're done or whatever. I got 'em all, I win. (sighs) (glass breaking) - You gonna pay for that? - It was loose, it-it was... Look, guy, it was gonna fall anyway, so... - My name isn't Guy, I'm a retired Lieutenant Colonel from the United States Armed Forces! - Sir, yes sir! How much do I owe you for the stupid bird feeder. - Hey, why do you guys gotta be so far away by the pole?! Isn't there more power over here? I don't need like phone or internet or anything, just the basics. Hey, Marv? How much is this gonna run me? - Webster, don't be foolish! Unemployed, living outdoors, proper arrangements have been made. (sighs) - What kind of voltage are we thinking? - I don't fully understand the question. - Well, son, are you planning to hook up a washer and dryer, or is that baby fridge gonna be the bulk of it? - It's a mini fridge. - Call it what you will. - I have a nightlight too. Is that gonna be a problem? - Baby fridge, nightlight, tree house. Ain't you a little bit too old for all this? - Marv, just do the job you've been paid to do. Okay? - Aye-aye. - Thanks. - [Voiceover] Alright, alright. (radio announcer chatters softly) (hopeful music) (sniffs) - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Hi. Is this it? - Uh, oh. Do you want one of these magazines? - Oh no, I just want all my mail. - That's it. - Oh, K, thanks. - Hey, Dwayne, how's it going man? Hey, Dwayne! What, Buena's got you working hard doesn't she? Hey you're scaring... Hey! You're scaring me man! Dwayne! Okay, hold on! Hold on, hold on! I'm gonna come d-- - You're not a doctor. It was just his time to go. There was nothing you could have done. - He was old, old people die all the time. It's just the circle of life. - Actually you could have gotten out of the tree house. And at least, tried to save him. - My dad bet me I couldn't do it. I was 12 years old, and he told me how he spent a whole Summer in his tree house. Even gave himself a rule, one hour out of the tree house a day. So, I made the same goal. I lasted 36 hours. A week later, my old man killed himself. And I can't help but think, maybe if I would just held it out, stuck it out, maybe, maybe he would've too. Since that Summer, I haven't finished anything that I've started. So it's simple. I'm doing it over. First goal I ever made. I'm doing it again. - Blue is the color of the ocean when sailors head off to sea. And green was the color of the grass when Dwayne departed on his voyage to the next life. And beige was Dwayne's favorite color, his carpet was beige, and his clock was beige, his cat was beige, his dog was brown. (knocking) - Webster. - Hi. - How you doing? - I'm fine, um, I was wondering if you wanted to come over to the tree house and maybe, hang out, or chat for just a little bit. - You know I really have to finish-- - You know what? I only have like 45 seconds so, can we finish talking about that at the tree house? - Thanks. (cans popping) - Hmm. No caffeine. Do you wanna shoot the BB gun? - What? - The BB gun. You could shoot some cans, or try to hit a bird or something. - I don't think so, I've never shot a gun before. - You can just watch me shoot if you want? Or, I could, I could show you? That's really my only idea. - [Voiceover] I don't know what I'm doing. - Well, first of all you need a BB. Pump. - Okay. - Okay. Now, this is real simple, just aim, and then pull the trigger. Oop, this goes here. - Well, what if I miss and hit something? - You're probably gonna miss, it is your first time. Okay, now pull the trigger. - [Voiceover] Now? - [Voiceover] Are you aiming? - [Voiceover] Yes. - [Voiceover] Then pull. (pop) - I hit it. (laughs) I wanna do it again. - It's my turn. (sighs) You can go after me. - Come on, Jester. - Hey, Fester. Looks like someone's finally here to watch you suck. You in the big brother club or something? Go get hit by a pitch, get on base for a change. - He used to sell copy machines. - Who gives a rat's crap, Fester? - I do. - You're an idiot. You know that? (laughing) - Strike one! Strike two! Strike three, the batter's out! - [Voiceover] Alright, boys, big smiles. (camera shutter clicks) - So, how'd the first eight innings go? - Yeah, come on, let's go guys! Let's do it! (fun rock music) I got a couple doubles. And a triple. Would've got a home run if it wasn't for the umpire. He doesn't like Jews. - I didn't know you were Jewish. - Well, not a hundred percent. Save as much time as you can for tomorrow, I've got a few things for the three of us planned. - Okay. What sort of things? - B-eight, b-eight. I started up about three months ago, did a little research and to my discovering dismay, there's no bingo anywhere in town. N-44, n-4-4. So now, every citizen over the age of 65 is eligible to buy in. - Buy in? - Five dollar buy in, two hour block. I usually get in about 12 games, profit around three, four hundred. - I'm pretty sure that's illegal. - Creating an enjoyable activity for senior citizens? How could that be illegal? - It's profiteering. - N-44, n-4-4. - Can I do one? - No. You see that man over there? That's Mayor Jenkins, he never misses a game. Not to mention, I'm a minor. What they gonna do? N-43, N-43. - Bingo! - We have a winner. (applause) And also, I make sure he wins at least once. (laughing) What? - Mayor Jenkins? - I shoulda thought of this. (upbeat pop music) We are making excellent time. I've still got like 45 minutes. - What are we doing? - Follow me,boys. I still owe Jester for hooking me up with electricity. - He's far too young to be behind the wheel of a vehicle. - Oh, he just looks young. He's 15 going on 16. - Who are you? - I'm the boy's father. - No way you're his father. - I was very young, and, she was Brazilian. - They were in love, big whoop. - Who the hell are you? - I'm their mailman. - How old is he really? - He's 13. - You really his father? A hundred bucks? - Okay. - Get in. (foreign language radio) (radio clicks off) (radio comes on) (BB tinks can) - What? - What are you doing? - I'm sleeping. - I can't sleep. - So what do you want me to do about it? - Come hang out with me. - No. - I'll let you be the green guys. I'll let you be Jiggly-Puff! (BB tinks can) - What? - Sorry. (snoring) - You know, Peter, he gives her things. In her mailbox. - What sort of things? - Eh, little things he finds along his route. Trinkets and such. She keeps them in a bucket behind her back door. - Why? - I don't know, maybe Beth's one of those people who can't bring herself to throw away a gift. Or, maybe she's secretly in love with Peter. - You think she loves him? - I don't know, some things are just a mystery. Sort of like this box. Can we open it? - [Voiceover] No, not yet. - Mr. Clark? No, no, no, no, no. Come on, come on. Mr. Clark? Come on. Don't be dead. Don't be dead you dumb old-- (screams) (laughing) - You know why I did that? Because you bother me. It bothers me that you don't shine your shoes, and have messy clothes, that your soft and pudgy, and slow moving and vacant looking. It bothers me that you just don't seem to have a clue. (chuckling) Boo! (upbeat music) - Sailboats. Know why I love 'em? - No, why? - 'Cause my dad does, and his dad. And therefore, it's in my blood. - Your grandpa, this guy? - No, that's my mother's father. Dad's father, died in the Port Huron to Mackinac race of 1983. The world's largest sailboat race. - Whoa. - I've entered in a race of my own. - What kind of a race? - Sailboat race down at the city reservoir. Model sailboats. You hand them with a control line. I have to assemble the whole thing from scratch. Paint and all. - You have to make your own paint? - [Voiceover] Well, I guess not entirely from scratch. - [Voiceover] When is it? - [Voiceover] It's in the middle of August, I should check the paper for the exact date. - I'm gonna be there. - Actually, Peter, my dad's coming to town, he's pretty excited about the whole thing. So, I, think it'd probably be best if it was just the two of us. If that's okay? - Thanks for lettin' me put some of my stuff here. - No problem. - So, uh, do you like sailboats? - Yeah, I love 'em. - Yeah, me too. - Oh, flower. So um, why did you ask me that? If I like sailboats? - Oh, just 'cause. Um, my tree house, tomorrow 8:30, don't be late. - [Voiceover] Why? (guitar music) (sighs) - You have 22 seconds. - King me. - Checkers mate. Winner, loser. Shake hands. - He's just not a winner. (laughing) - Take your seats, please. And, checkers! - He was just better than I was. - I told you to use the Bristol cross. Such a capture generally leads to an early king. Leaving your opponent completely demoralized, and practically beating him from the very beginning stages of the match. - Peter, that guy's been playing for a lot longer than him. He was three times your age. - Maybe next year. - Peter's right though, I mean, you shoulda used the Bristol crossing. - Do you even know how to play checkers? - Do you even know how to play cribbage? (upbeat music) (inaudible) - D-one, d-one! That's a good number, right there. Oh, look, o-25, o-25. - Bingo. I got a bingo. - Hot dog, we have a wiener. There we go. Uh, Mr. Corbin Schwartz, Corbin Schwartz. - That's uh, nine in a row. (laughing) - Okay, let's keep going here. Oh, look at that, B-3! - Just I want two, at least two of each color, about the size of, of a mango. - You sure this is a good idea? - No. - 'Cause I don't want to get on this old man's bad side. - He hasn't got another side, he's barely human. - So, what exactly are we doing? - I'm not sure, just, come on. - [Voiceover] Hey there. - Hi. - You look pretty bored. - I am. - This is for you. - What is it? - Well, it's a box, but it's what's inside, I put some crossword puzzles, and board games and some cookies that I baked. - Thanks. You know, it's not, the greatest view of the sky, but, if you look, right up there, underneath that curved branch, you can see a star, and I'm pretty sure that it's part of the handle of the big dipper. - What about the little dipper? - Um, no I don't think you can see that one. But, I'm pretty sure that those three stars, right over there. - Yeah? - Those make up part of the old lady's rocking chair. The one she sits in. (chuckling) - What old lady? This rocking chair, I've never heard of that before. - Maybe it's an old man, I can't quite remember. Maybe a recliner. I don't know. - What about the north star? - You can't see the north star. Only in winter. - [Jester] You nervous? - [Peter] No, shh. - Do you see him? - Don't ask any more questions, please? - [Voiceover] But, Peter... - What? - I'd like to know what I'm getting myself into. - Listen, we're just gonna watch the house, we're gonna keep a mental picture of his routine. Old men stick to a routine. - Then what? - We'll poison his pet. Do you think he has a pet, do you see any signs of a pet? - How'm I supposed to know? - Then we'll shoot him. With Webster's BB gun. - It's Robert's. - Let's go in for a closer look. (whispering) - When I was a kid, I used to sleep outside on the trampoline. And my older sisters would tell me about the milky way. They would say that if I could stay up late enough, I'd be able to see it. The first time I tried I fell asleep. I missed the whole thing. Did you ever, stay up late enough as a kid to see it? What are you doing? Why did you do that? - 'Cause, you were talking about the stars, and you gave me that flower. - Yeah, well I'm married, and you know that I'm married. - He lives on a submarine. - No, he doesn't. - Well, he's never around. And I live in your back yard. Where are you going? - [Beth] I gotta go. This is my fault, and, and, I don't even know what to say to you. I gotta go. - You gave me a flower. - So what? - And you baked me those cookies. (sighs) - It looks like all he does is watch television, and I believe you're correct on the pet issue, I don't see any exterior pets, no dogs or cats or anything like that. But let's not rule out a hamster or maybe a goldfish. - You know, we could just steal something. Find a light. - Shh, I'm looking for one. Shh. Hey look, pink flamingo. (whispering) - This would make great decoration for story night. We could slip out of here with a few, don't you think? - I'd steal anything. What are you looking at me like that for? - I'm glad you're my mailman. - You really mean that? - Wholeheartedly. - Look what else I stole from that old fart's house. (cackling) (old-timey blues music) - [Voiceover] Where are all the people? - Did you uh, did you deliver the invitations? - Yeah, I did. - Did you deliver 'em like you deliver the mail? - Maybe story night isn't for everybody. - Maybe I shoulda had someone else deliver the invitations. - Maybe I wished I lived in a tree house and I didn't have to have a job or have-- - Maybe I wish I was a genius. And then, became a mailman. - It was a mental collapse, it's what the paper said. - She's not coming. She's just not. She's married. And she doesn't love us. - She loves that submarine guy. - Go home, Jester. Go home, and work on your ridiculous sailboat. - You're selfish. - I'm selfish? - You're selfish, and you're smarmy. And you're, you're a jack-face. - Go home. I don't need you ruining my entire summer, go home. - Fine. And I'm probably not ever coming back. - Good. I'm glad. - She just doesn't love you. (melancholy pop music) (pop) - So um, number one of evidence, toilet paper, which was all over my face. Uh, exhibit B, my motorcycle got flipped over. Which I had to take to the shop, I don't know how much that's gonna cost me. My couch got flipped over, there was bugs and dirt all over it. Clothes everywhere, very traumatic, and the two guys responsible are sittin' over there, so... If you wanna take 'em, take 'em to wherever, you can... - Okay, um, look, I'm gonna level with you, I'm not seeing a lot of evidence that there was any crime, just some toilet paper, and uh, some juice boxes. You coulda done that. You know, in a couple minutes, just wadded that up. Toilet paper isn't even a misdemeanor, in this cit-- - Can I go home? (laughing) - You guys are so funny, you're cracking me up. (laughing) You guys! This is fun, so much fun! - No, really, I gotta go home, I want my twenty bucks. - Oh, you gotta go to a baseball game, huh? Championship!? Cool. Hit a home run, we'll see you back tomorrow. - I'm gonna, I'm gonna take off. I'm gonna go ahead and leave. - Are you sure you don't need to, you haven't even come up here, you can... - Well, uh... (knocking) No. - I got like four more juice boxes you could help me stay and, kill those. - I've got juice, right there. And I think I'm gonna leave it there. Um, what was your name? - Webster. - Webster. Thank you, don't call us again. - Hey! Stay for some pie? - Why not? Thank you. - Then the old lady says, "that's pepper spray, Jared." (laughing) (peppy pop music) - [Voiceover] Please be at the tree house, 7:20 sharp. It's imperative that you're there, Webster. - This is a box, in which I keep all my favorite things. I'd like you each to choose a thing, and the thing that you choose, will then be yours. - [Voiceover] Heh, it's a name tag. What is it? - [Voiceover] It's a picture. - I just wanted you guys to have something of mine. - Thanks, Webster. Pull. (gunshot) - How much time do you have? - I got time to do one. - One? - One. Okay, pull. (gunshot) Thank you. - How much bullets does this thing take? - Hey, the box. - [Voiceover] What about it? - I can't believe you haven't opened it. - You told us we couldn't. - Well, do you wanna open it? - Now? - Sure. - Well? Read it. (knocking) - I know, I'm coming, just give me ten more minutes and I'm just gonna, go... What? - [Voiceover] Bethany, my name is Gabrielle Ortega, your husband Wade has been living with me for the last four months, and we were deeply in love. Yesterday, he died. I'm sending you his wedding ring, and to tell you that his body has been buried in the small village of Santa Isabel. I want you to know, that he died a happy man. I'm very sorry for your loss. (sad pop music) - [Voiceover] What about a funeral? - Well, there's no body, it's sort of hard to have a funeral without a body. - Well, they have body-less funerals all the time, I mean, when people get lost at sea-- - All the time? - What if, we can get that body back for her? - We don't even know where Santa Isabel is. - Santa Isabel is a small municipality in north central Brazil. Population three, four thousand, it didn't become a city until early 1980s, I have an idea. How much time do you have? - 28 minutes. (sighs) - So, what makes you idiots think that she wants the body back? - It's her husband. I'm sure she wants a full viewing, funeral, flowers, obituary, everything. - Well, probably not the viewing, but, all the rest of that stuff. - I could do it, I don't doubt that for a second. Might even be kinda fun. But... Cost you twenty thousand dollars. - Twenty thousand? Just for digging up a dead body? Seems a little steep. - It's out of country. That changes everything. - How much does an in country body cost? - Half that price. - I'm sorry, I just, there's no-- - Will a check be okay? - Check'll be just fine. - I told you he's not just a postman. - What's the turnaround on a job like this? - 72 hours. (Brazilian instrumental music) - [Voiceover] I wonder what he looked like. - Peter, there are pictures of him, all over the place. - I mean, when he dug him up. (sniffling) (sighs) I'm sorry that your husband had an affair, and that he died. - Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for getting him back. You gotta go? - I still have a couple minutes. - How long are you gonna be gone? - I don't know. Couple weeks, maybe. - Do you need me to hold your mail? - I don't know. - So, good looking assortment of flowers, there's no getting around that. - Yeah. It's real pretty. (melancholy rock music) - [Voiceover] You know my race is tomorrow. - Yeah I know, I really do want to be there. - I know, it's not that I don't want you there, just, I haven't seen my dad in awhile, and I think, it'd be best if it was just the two of us. - You think you're gonna win? - I do. - Do you need to use my bike and trailer? - No, my dad's picking me up. Peter? You really a genius? (melancholy music) - Yeah, I was. - What do you think? - It's a lot smaller than I thought. What time do you leave? - My dad's picking me up at seven. He thinks we should get a couple practice runs in before the race starts. - Yeah. What's your dad's name? - Stewart. What's your dad's name? - His name was Donald. But he went by Don. - That's a nice name. - Thanks. So can I see it, or? - Sure. - Santa Isabel. That's a nice name. You wanna come up? - Yeah. - Better win. Make me proud. (melancholy pop music) - Hey, Peter. Come have a seat. You know, Pete, there's no easy way to fire a man, but you must have known this was coming. - What? - Hey, you're lucky to be avoiding legal action. I'm sorry. (pop music) (bubbling) (sighs) - [Voiceover] Jester! - What are you guys doing here? - Hey, tiny human, did you win? We haven't missed it have we? I thought it was an all day event. It hasn't started yet, right? - How long did it take you to get here? - I didn't bring my watch. - Webster. You shouldn't have come. - So there isn't a boat race? What did you, did you make it up? - I made it up. (laughing) Shouldn't you be at work? - No, I got fired. - They let you keep the bike and trailer, huh? - No, I stole it. I'm gonna go for a swim. - You know, you've kinda turned into a bit of a thief. - I'm a pirate. Like a highway man. (laughing) (screaming) (laughing) - You broke your rule. - It wasn't really my rule. - You know, I don't have a dad. Or a mom. I mean I have them, I just, don't know who they are. The old man I live with, he's just a foster parent, he's not my grandpa. - Where's your sailboat? - It sunk. (peppy pop music)
