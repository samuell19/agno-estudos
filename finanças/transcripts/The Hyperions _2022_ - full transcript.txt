Next stop, Rainey Avenue, doors open on the left. Oh my gosh, mommy! - Mommy! - Oh my god! This is the eastbound E train. Next stop, Washington Avenue. Ah. There you are. Maya told you, didn't she? Now how would you know that? She tells you everything. I think you read my mind. What did I say about doing that? Very clever, it's impolite! Stop it, Vista! I'm not joking! You know you're never allowed in my head. All right, come on, hand it over. Come on. That's not fair! Hand it over. Reading a person's mind, unless it's for a mission is? A privilege that warrants approval. That's right. So where are you going? I'd like to have an address. Why? Well, 'cause I know Ansel will want to write to you. New York City. Squirreling back to Manhattan. I have a little gift for you. It's just your watch. Oh no, it's a compass. Matter of fact, it's the compass my mother gave me. She told me it would take me wherever I wanted to go, bring me home when I was done. Thanks, I guess. You hate me. I beg your pardon? I read your mind. Don't think that. I mean, I don't hate you. I was a little frustrated, that's all. Mind if I ride with you for a while? Fine. Stay together, everybody stay together, come on. My favorite! The Hyperions Family Museum will be closing in 10 minutes. Thank you for visiting. The United States Space Program calls upon the high security to assist in the tests of Earth. This is a housing project right here. This is, people would live here. This is a five story building. The museum will be closing very soon. Please follow the green exit signs through the gift shop. Thank you for visiting the Hyperion Family Museum. Who's that? Professor Mandulbaum here. The Hyperions and I hope you had a grand time. Please visit again soon. - Okay. - Right. Yeah. Oh, ma'am we're closing. Sir, Ma'am? Ma'am? Everybody against the wall! Ansel, your gun! Oh, shit! Get against the wall. Get against the wall. Now! Make a little group, that's it, together. Okay. Ansel? Ansel! What's this? They're locked in. Locked in? You work here? Me? You, yes, come here. I need the key to this display lock. There isn't a key to that case. What do you mean there isn't a key? What is this, what am I looking at? Fingerprint identification. It's the only way to open the case. Which one of you can open it? I need to make a phone call. Distro Chex soap and American Millimeter Films present Professor Mandulbaum's Hyperions! Where each week we're invited into the mysterious headquarters of the world's only superhero family. And now your host, Professor Ruckus Mandulbaum. Good day, Hyperion club members. And welcome to Hyperion Hall. How are you doing today, Mercury? Suit up for adventure! You can say that again, old friend. You know, it's been nearly 20 years since the remarkable story of the Hyperions began. And nearly 20 years since I invented this. The Titan Badge. I know it doesn't look like much, does it? But believe you me, this little device packs quite a punch. Let me show you what I mean. Everyone you know from your best friend to your math teacher is filled with this magical material. It's called DNA. DNA is given to you by your parents and acts like a blueprint for the body. Everything from eye color to the shape of your nose is contained in this little strand of DNA. So what does this little fellow do? Well, when I make a badge, I make it for one person. It plugs into that person's DNA and changes one piece of their blueprint. For example, I can tell the body to have x-ray vision or to be able to shrink to the size of an ant. So you see, this Titan Badge can grant an individual a superhuman power. Imagine that, a real life superhero. So the question became who do I choose to give this power to? I traveled the globe in search of the brightest, most selfless young people on earth, finally finding three suitable candidates. Maya was given the ability to teleport from place to place with nothing more than a thought. Vista was granted the ability to read and influence minds. And Ansel, the youngest of the children gained super strength, becoming the strongest human ever to live. I brought the children into my home where we trained, awaiting the day when their powers would be needed. And boy, were they needed. Adventure! Exploration! Heroic rescues! For 20 years, the valiant exploits of Professor Mandelbaum's Hyperions have shaped out world. Calling all Hyperions. And for nearly 20 years we'd been invited each week to witness retellings of their unbelievable stories through the Hyperions television program. Follow team leader Maya, the teleporting Titan! Vista, the mind-reading rapscallion! And Ansel, the strongest boy alive as they show the world the meaning of the world family. Over the years, the Hyperions have faced innumerable threats both at home and abroad. Our contributions to world peace are beyond debate. Members come and go. Every few years we bid farewell to the old class and welcome three new team members to carry on the tradition of service. In fact, just last month, we announced the end of our second class, and the search for our third generation of team members has already begun. So far, we have chosen only one. Meet Apollo, our brand new Hyperion. But the search continues for the other two. Could you be the next Hyperion? Next question, how's the family? The family is, gosh, what is it? Marvelous. Marvelous, right. Look, I can't remember all these lines. I mean why are we even doing this interview with what was her name again? Meredith Lane. She's very influential with the 15 over demographic. Sign here. Once again, how's the family? Family's fine, thank you for asking. They're marvelous. Marvelous. Hyperion call. Sir, Mercury's ringing. - Let me get that. - They're going to have to call back later. We're almost at the studio. Sign here. What's your name? Delano. Delano. I need you to call this number. Call it over and over again. If no one picks up, hang up and call again. Do that until you get an answer. When you do, yell out for me. Understand? Are you the real Vista? Say you understand. I understand. What are you doing? What did I just say? Hah, yeah, no, oh! So close. Come on, a little higher. Oh, good throw, good throw, like a rocket. What the hell is going on here? Trying to knock down the security cameras. Police can tap right into those, see right into here. Who are you? Olly Pinkletter, I'm the junior security guard here. Yeah, Ollie here, he has some experience with robbing places and so you know, just tell her, go ahead. I robbed the place across the street two years ago. Yeah, he's giving some advice, that's all. Cameras, knock 'em down, how to deal with hostage negotiators. Oh and, you forgot to frisk me. Pardon me. But I think you two need to tell the rest of us here what's going on. Is this real? Yes ma'am, this is real. Miss. - That's what I hate. - Mr. Ansel. My name is, Do you mind signing this? Well I want that too. I usually take the bullets out. Anna, Anna, A. Would you mind taking a picture with me? Maybe try this on. - I mean not now. - I was here first. - I'll show you the exhibits and I know everything. - How close to the actual plane? - What did he say? - Ah! I have a gun. Okay? This is real. Now, just, take a seat over there and we'll be out of here in no time. Okay, uh, look, what did he say? On the phone? He didn't answer. He didn't answer? What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here? What's our next move? I need a minute to think. Vis. Hey, Ollie. Is there a way to get out of here, like a loading area or something? - Oh yeah, actually, if you head down- - Hey, hey, hey, no. No, no, no, no, no. We are not going anywhere without those badges. All right, we talked about this. Okay. You said this would take five minutes. You said we'd be out of here by now and nothing can go wrong! Yeah, well you said that the badges were only protected by a single pane of glass which is what I based the plan on. Okay, well yeah, I did say that, yes, that is true. Hyperion Family Museum. It's the police. They want to talk to whoever's in charge. Hey, Vista. Vista! What am I gonna do with these people? Hey. Hey. Just give us a minute. Yeah, you guys could just, I guess, Oh boy. On scene and we are now in position. Remember when we enter, take a moment to assess the situation. Assess, plan and act. Right, okay. Ready? Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready. Remember to breathe. Shit. Hello, Maya. Agh! Junior Mints. No, I think we did really well. Honestly. Oh, thank you. I feel like I did pretty good. Don't, don't scratch that. But the hole's itchy. Gunshots to the chest can sting. I'd recommend next time using your power. Turn my skin into metal? I think it would have made a difference, don't you? Yeah, if you think so. Are you there, Maya? Are you there? Go for Maya. It's a bad connection, can you speak up? Excuse me, I beg your pardon. Thank you so much. Hello? Yes, I need you back right away. The news is saying there's a hostage situation at the museum! Somebody's attempting to pinch my shit! Wait, are you alone? Did I say shit? On my way. Maya. Speaking French. Merci. Looks like you're gonna be staying with Dr. Charles for the week, okay? Do you want the remote? Who's Dr. Charles? Where am I? Paris. Every time I stay here, I beg Dr. Charles to get cable. Oh, MASH. Who's Dr. Charles? Oh, he's our private physician. Look, do me a favor. It's very important you don't tell the Professor about your injury. Don't tell him about Dr. Charles either, okay? Yeah, of course. Why? There are some details the public shouldn't know about. And since the Professor's the face of the team, we wouldn't wanna put him in a situation where he'd have to lie to the public, would we? Hey Maya, what's your ETA? Leaving now. Sergeant, I don't want you to worry a bit. I've written every single word you've said in my notebook. I won't let you down again, sir. Over and out. All units, we have a code 805, repeat, code 805. All right people, look alive, goddamit! Sergeant Burns just confirmed that we've got a Hyperion en route. Not a good time to look stupid. Oh God. Hey, Fitzpatrick, come here. I locked my keys in the car. Take care of that one. Are you Captain Woodcock? Looks like a hostage situation. Any idea how many are inside, demands? No words from anybody inside. What about security cameras? Cameras inside are just for show. Non functional. You've attempted contact by phone? They keep hanging up. Have you tried knocking on the door? The Hyperion Arm Device attaches onto the forearm. The Titan Badge is then locked into place allowing the precision needle to act as a highway for the DNA altering material to, We've run into a small problem. Nothing big, but we might need more time than we discussed. What constitutes a small problem? Nothing, really. Everything's fine. When will I have them? I'll call you. Maya. Vista. What are you doing here? These men think there's a robbery going on in there. There is. Well, do you have the thieves? How many are there? Have you spoken to the Professor? Not yet. Well, let me in, I'll help. I can't. I'm the one robbing the place. You're kidding. No. And I need the Professor right away. Have you lost your mind? Don't bother trying to teleport in here. I have the cork. You don't. What is the cork? Well, this little device acts as my security system in preventing any abuse in power that may come from granting the Hyperions super powers. With one push of a button, I am able to generate a power-free radius where none of the Titan badges can function. Let me give you an example. Take this dashing super powered Hyperion Team member. Mmm? Yes, you. Would you mind showing us what happens when you attempt to use your power in the cork zone? You stole the cork? How did you get it? It doesn't matter. The inside of this museum is off limits to you. Vista, you're making a big mistake. We need the Professor now, we don't have much time. Who's we? I, I need the Professor. Did you seriously drag Ansel into this? Bring him here. What the hell are you thinking? Holding up the museum, taking hostages? And then you have the nerve to make demands of me and your father. You don't get to do that, young lady. Drop the weird babysitter routine, Maya. I'm not trying to be your goddamn babysitter. I'm trying to talk to you one adult to another. What are you doing here? I just need the Professor to come. That's all this is? Some bizarre way of reconnecting? This has nothing to do with you. Of course it does! You abandoned us 10 years ago like a spoiled brat. And then out of nowhere you hold up the museum. And dragging Ansel into it? I'm trapped, Maya. Let me get you and Ansel out of here. I can't. I'll take you home. I can't, I can't go anywhere. This is gonna break your father's heart. Don't call him that. Don't call him what? He's not my father! Vista, be gentle. You've both made mistakes. I was a kid. I was allowed to make mistakes. How many apology letters do I have to write? I sent hundreds. And all the while he just dragged my name through the mud for like 10 years, as if cutting me off in every way wasn't enough? I wake up every other night with lingering pains from years of injuries. Broken bones, gunshot wounds, stab wounds, I was stabbed! He wasn't always aware of everything. Oh, please. Vista. Don't be so eager to destroy the man's legacy. He cares about you. He cares about the team, not the people on it. And I'm no longer an employee. You're wrong. Ruckus has never just thought of us as employees. Not you, at least. What's that supposed to mean? Come on, Maya. You were always the favorite. Ruckus cares about all of us equally. Vista! Don't forget which one of us used to read minds. Leave your men outside of the building. Nobody enters. Yes, ma'am. Maya. Just give me a moment. Look, I know I'm not supposed to be seen in public- I'm kind of in the middle of something, Ares. I completely understand. I don't wanna be a bother. Wait, what country is this? Is this Idaho? What's on your mind, Ares? Maya, I wanna be back on the team. I could train like you did. I'm a Hyperion through and through. - Ares. - Look, I know the Professor and I have had our fair share of headbutting. I wasn't perfect. Hell, sometimes I was even a burden. But look at these! I've photocopied some news articles I believe highlights some of the great work I've done. Like this one, when I assisted in the Atlantic Pipeline rupture. Or this one when I assisted in the USS Sherman expedition. And I didn't even complain when I was asked to supervise negotiations in Korea. Even though the dear leader was super handsy. Ares, please be understanding. You've done a wonderful job. I could do more, Maya. The Professor's firm on this, it's time to go. You're gonna have all the money you'll ever need. Don't make waves again. Let it go. You go home now, Ares. What happened, who was it? Maya. Hey, what's your name again? Delano. Can you give me a hand up here? What did Maya say? She's bringing the Professor. - Delano. - Yes? I need you to help me block this door, okay? So maybe some boxes. Do you have anything bigger? Yeah. - What else have you got? - I was thinking about what we talked about earlier, remember? If things were to get out of hand, instead of just handing over the badges, why don't we just use 'em? It hasn't come to that yet. Yeah but I still kind of think we should at least be ready to use the powers. Ansel. I need to know that you're doing this for the same reason I am. Oh, of course, this is about Ruby, getting your daughter back. - Right. - Yeah. So we stick to the plan. We do what they ask, give them the badges and they'll let her go. Okay, but how do we know that they will? If we were to use the badges, it just would make more sense if, Ansel. You know that the badges don't make you happy. You're so much more than some guy who can lift a car over his head. Besides, how many people need cars lifted over their heads anyway? Our guest this evening requires no introduction. He is known and beloved throughout the world as the father and leader of the world's most famous family of superheroes. He is of course, Professor Ruckus Mandulbaum. Welcome to the show, Professor. Thank you for having me, Meredith. I suppose we should also welcome Mercury. Yes. Say hello, Mercury. Adventure awaits! Brilliant. And how's the family? The team is just, don't tell me, it's right on the tip of my tongue. Marvelous? Why yes, yes, thank you, marvelous, marvelous. Now you're in the middle of a transition, are you not? With the second team being replaced? Yes, we are retiring the second generation and currently in the process of finding a new team. We do have a new member. - Apollo. - Yes. That's me. And how is he coming? I don't know what you're saying. You adopted children from the original team. Vista and Ansel. Yes, that's correct. But not Maya, she was an adult already. No, we hired Maya. And why was that? Well, Meredith. Because the team would be required to travel from the highest mountain to the deepest ocean, we realized that some adult supervision might be necessary on certain missions. And when I met Maya, she was a very responsible young woman and I knew she would fit in very well with the children. Now when you were replacing the original children, you mentioned the concept of using robots instead. Yes. I was noodling on robots. But you know, in the end, to be a Hyperion one must have heart and compassion. And of course, robots can't replace the soul required to be on this team. Well, Professor, there were many groups who read into that original desire to use robots as a sign that perhaps there were more problems under the surface of the team than were being revealed to us. Is that accurate? Problems? I can't think of any. Hello. Sorry to interrupt. Professor, we have a bit of a problem. What? A problem. Oh gosh. I do beg your pardon, but, Problems? Not really, just late for an appointment. So sorry. Thank you. Hyperion Hall, known throughout the world as the headquarters of the world famous superhero team. Behind the walls of this elegant structure, world leaders have sought the assistance of the Hyperions. It is also, however, the home where Professor Mandulbaum has raised his children. And like millions of fathers around the world, Professor Mandulbaum has had his fair share of challenges bringing up his children Ansel and Vista. Who can forget the public rebellions of his often disobedient Vista? After several very public attempts at running away, young Vista in her most rebellious act of all publicly condemned the Professor on the eve of her ill-conceived wedding to Wes Harrison, the Andy Warhol superstar and former television child actor. In spite of the Professor's unconditional support and love, Vista abandoned the family leaving millions of concerned citizens wondering if the team they had come to love and rely on was on the brink of collapse. But Professor Mandulbaum saw an opportunity, an opportunity to refresh the team that had grown stale. And so after releasing Ansel, the Professor introduced the world to three new youths, leaving Maya to train the newcomers. Every few years, the Hyperions will retire the old class and welcome the new, thus ensuring continued safety for the human race for generations to come. In the famous words of the Professor, "May we forget the mistakes of our past and look with anticipation to the future. Leave behind the old and embrace the new." Grab a pen. You're about to make a statement. It's Vista and Ansel. They've taken hostages. Vista and Ansel? I spoke to her, Ruckus. Face to face. I bet she talked him into it. Do the police know it's them? I don't think they know about Ansel but they did see her. In uniform. In uniform? Oh, that's just great. That's just great, that's just be-loody marvelous. Ruckus, Vista needs you. Oh, I bet she does. I bet she does! The problem is, Maya, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, even though I'm not. I seem to remember her telling me she never wants to see me again. - Ever. - She wouldn't tell me what was going on. Can't you see what she's trying to do? She's trying to destroy me! She's in trouble. Yes, that's a great way to ask for help, isn't it? Taking hostages. Wait. These are how she's been asking for help. I thought I told you to get rid of those. You're making such a mess in here. Akiko just cleaned! Every month she writes you another letter. The least you could do is read one. I don't need to read them. I know what's in them. They're probably just asking for more money. Why can't you just let that go? She was upset. Of course she's upset. Ripped from an orphanage, dragged to a beautiful mansion where there's, what's this? Caviar, open trays of caviar all over the house, I mean who has that? Hmm? I mean that's a little off, but still. Forced to have super powers, fame. Maybe she doesn't care about the powers and fame. Who doesn't care about power and fame? I mean what is she, some kind of an alien? I mean what more can I give? All I do is give, give, give. And who's on my side at the end of the day? I am. Nobody. - I wanna see the cork. - Hmm? The cork. You have it, right? Yes. I'll never show it to you. You don't lie to me, Ruckus. Maya! Oh, sod it. What did I say? Maya! Maya? God, I do wish you'd stop rushing off, you know how I hate chasing you like this. Why are you packing? Are you going somewhere? How long have you been lying about the cork? Do you know how dangerous that could have been? What if it fell into the wrong hands? Well, it didn't. Bugger. Vista said something today. It really got me thinking, Ruckus. Do share the wisdom. Can't wait to hear this one. I'm sure it's a real doozy. She said you loved the team, not the people on it. You don't really believe that, do you? I'm not sure what I believe anymore, Ruckus. All I know is that I'm tired. I'm tired of saying goodbye to people I love. I'm tired of the fight and I'm tired of the burden. Ah. There you are. I'm tired of taking sides. I'm tired of you disappearing. Look! I really didn't mean to rattle your cage. Would you at least have the decency to stay- Ruckus, look at me. This isn't just about the cork, Ruckus. It's about us, all of us. I wish you would just say what it is you want to say. I understand Vista hurt you. I know you're scared. I know you loved those two kids and I know why you dismissed Ansel when she left. But Ruckus, I'm not sure they know how you feel. Every penny I spent should have told them. The PR team said I had to start fresh with whole new Hyperions. What choice did I have? Like it or not, you formed a family. You have two children and you have me. We've never understood where we stand, Ruckus. What are we to you? What am I? Professor? Yes? What is it? I've just received word that we're about to hear a prepared statement from one of the culprits in the museum hostage situation. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be live. And five, four, three. My name is Vista Mandulbaum. My brother Ansel and I have taken four hostages. We've come for one thing, our Titan Badges. The badges are currently locked in a case that only Professor Mandulbaum can unlock. Nobody will leave this building until we have those badges. Well. That appears to be all we're going to be hearing from the scene, so in summation, from what we've just heard live, Professor, what do you think? Yeah. At least we know where we stand. Dice, you get to roll first. All right. So everyone gets a pack of cards. That's for you. Thanks. And you get to choose whoever you wanna be, yeah. Was spotted over the eastern seaboard. Well, it's difficult to see through the tremendous smoke here on the streets, but I believe, I see yes! Ladies and gentlemen, I could see Ansel Mandulbaum. He's carrying, he's emerging from the haze and he's carrying, oh I can't believe what I'm seeing. He's carrying the missile above his head! Ansel Mandulbaum has saved us all! He stopped the missile! Ansel has saved countless lives and I have never seen such a display of heroism and self-sacrifice in all my life. Ansel Mandulbaum, the Hyperion super team has caught a rogue soviet missile. The crowd is cheering. What a moment to witness in person. Citizens are in tears and they are reaching out to thank the young hero. Hey, Mr. Ansel? You wanna get in on this? I'm hot, I'm tired, this is like flying coach. - Oh, new player. - Here you go, here are your blue cards. Hey, all right. You get to roll first. But first you have to choose a guy from the characters left in this box. Did someone take Ansel? I did, I'm Ansel. I hope you don't have a problem with that. I was kinda hoping I could be Ansel. Hey, look, let's see who's in here? Okay, look there! Here's Ares, you could be him. He's pretty neat, he's blue. Yeah, yeah. - That's fine, yeah, yeah. - Great, that's okay? Okay good, okay good, let's go. - All right, so. - Were you there? Can we all focus here? Ant, can we all focus for a minute? Ansel is supposed to roll the dice. I don't feel like playing. Okay, that was very dramatic. Okay well he seemed kinda upset. You were bullying him. Don't put it on me. I think he has some emotional issues. What'd I do wrong? No, no. You haven't done anything wrong. Well, that's not entirely true. We did warn you about seeing Vista, Ansel. I missed her. She just wanted to talk. But didn't we tell you not to talk to her, Ansel? She wants to ruin the team. Dad, I'm sorry I saw Vista. But I wanna stay. My boy, you've done a grand job. Maybe it's for the best. Now you can be free to think of all the things that you would like to do, like what would you like to be when you grow up? This, I like this. Well, the team just feels, we all feel that perhaps it's time for someone else to take on the responsibility. Do I have to move out? Of course not. Well I'm sure we can secure you a wonderful place nearby. So you can visit as often as you'd like. My point is, if you need someone to talk, I'd be more than happy to volunteer. Yeah I'll keep that in mind. Everybody stay here. Stop right there! Is he SWAT or something? He's not a cop. Are you? What happened to you? He kicked me in my chest. Broke the pen in my shirt. My brand new pen. But who is he? Don't give me that. He's yours, isn't he? How did he get in here? When will I have the badges? You're in the building. I wanna talk to Ruby. First you deliver the badges. No, you put her on now. Mommy? Hi, honey. Are you okay? Where are you? Mommy's just picking something up for you. I'll be right there. I'm coming to get you. Okay. Are they being nice to you? Are you watching TV? I'm losing my patience. You have 30 minutes to get me those badges. You're here. Ah, good evening everyone. Let's greet the fans. - Mhmm. - And then straight up to Vista. Right, will do. Ah, hello, hello, how are you, nice to meet you, hello. Are they treating you well here? Very well, thank you. - Professor, Alvin Delano. - Hello, hello. I'm the curator. Ah, yes, yes. All your creations here. Quite the stain you've got there. Yes, exploding pen. Hi Professor, I'm Sarah. I own the paper. I have this book that I used to know. Oh yes yes of course. What are you gonna say? Just that we need his thumbprint. Mr. Professor, would you please - sign this for me? - Yes? Ah, oh, what's this? It's you, a mask of you. Really? Ha, doesn't really look like me. Eh, it's pretty close. You gonna tell him about Ruby? Ready? Yes, I suppose so. I must say, the hostages seem pretty upbeat, don't you? Unnaturally so. What's this? Ah, there you are. Congratulations, Vista. It's a real fine mess you've gotten yourself and Ansel into. I gotta keep an eye on those people out there. Wait, wait, don't you mean hostages? I think that's what you call people you hold against their will. You do realize that armed robbery is a felony, don't you? You have any idea of the strings I'm gonna have to pull? To get you out of this mess, hm? I'll watch them. No, you stay right here, Maya. Why does she have to be here? I don't know, why does Ansel have to be here? Because he's my partner in this. Oh, please. It's true. That doesn't sound like my boy. Not my Ansel. Is it true? What? That you're half to blame for this mess? Maya, would you do me a favor and escort Ansel outside for a moment please? Fine. Shouldn't I at least stay to help explain? It's okay. I'll meet you outside. - 15 years and - Of course the first thing - that comes out of your mouth is about you. - Nothing has changed. - You're still just a spoiled - You think the whole world - revolves around you! - Little child! - Money, money... - You have everything anyone could want to have. You won't be satisfied until you've burned... Fixate on the one time someone didn't fall on your stupid precious little line. You're still a spoiled little child! It's good to see you, Ansel. Really? Yeah, of course. I've missed you. Things aren't the same without you. I've missed you too. Are you still in Detroit? No, I moved a few years ago. Now I'm living with Vista, actually. Oh, really? Haven't you been receiving our checks? I have. You're sharing them with Vista. She needs me. Her and Ruby both. Who's Ruby? You're spoiled and you're selfish! You have any idea what you've done?! You and your stupid persona. I beg your pardon? You don't even know when you're on television anymore. You can't tell the difference. Have I ever met the real Ruckus Mandulbaum anyway? I know who I am. I don't have to prove it to anyone. Least of all, you. But you want your little badge, don't you? You always get what you want. That's her. That's Ruby Red. Why didn't Vista tell us she had a daughter? How old is she? She's five. Want them so badly? You think these little bits of plastic will bring you happiness? Fine, they're all yours, whatever you want. That's all I've been asking for. Give, give, give, that's all I ever do. And we have an audience. Let the grand show begin. It's all yours. Well? Aren't you gonna put it on? It's a decoy. It's a decoy? Well of course it's a decoy. You don't actually think I'd allow the real badges to be out in the open in a traveling exhibit, do you? Dad, please. It's Dad now, is it? Ladies and gentlemen, I do apologize for the delay. This'll all be over momentarily. In the meantime, please help yourselves to some Hyperion juice boxes from the gift store. You don't understand. I understand when I'm being manipulated. Ruckus, stop! Maya, they're making me do this. Enough of this nonsense. Ansel, you can come with us. Dad, you need to listen. Ruckus, hear them out. I've heard all I need to hear. You can't leave us! They have my daughter! Did you say daughter? Ruckus. Hmm. What an adorable little girl. Tell me, is she a friend's kid or a union actress? Because if she has talent, I may be able to use her in an upcoming episode. Do you honestly think I would lie about this? I've seen you do worse. Don't do this. Put it in the case. I hope it makes you happy. I knew you'd end up abusing the power I gave you. Baby, what are you doing? Let's go. Don't even listen to him. It's ours. Now you haven't given me anything. - Sir? - Hmm? What's the situation? Well there's nothing more I can do in there. So I suggest you go in and resolve it your way, Captain. No, hold that. Ruckus, wait. Captain, it's a bit more complicated than we expected in there. Can you please be patient and hold off? Have the negotiator call and tell Vista we'll be back within the hour. Right away, ma'am. Nobody enter that building until we return. - Captain! - Yes, ma'am. Oh, Miss Maya? We just received this message for you. Professor? Hmm? Professor, I'm needed at the White House. Can you just go home and stay there, we'll talk when I'm back. I'm not gonna be long. Fine. Just teleport me back to the office and then you can read the President his bedtime story. You're not going anywhere with me. You acted like a stubborn ass back there. Well how am I supposed to get home? I had the car brought here, I'll find you a driver. Well what happened to my driver? Ah, for God's sake. To heck with it all, I'll drive myself. Ruckus! Captain! The Professor's never driven a car before. Can you find someone to drive him home, please? On it. Thank you. That man will do. Time's up. Excuse me. Would you mind picking a station and sticking to it please? Thank you. Oh, what a day, what a day. What are you looking at, hmm? Like you're so brave. Wanna know what kind of a day I've had? I'll tell you. I'm a grandfather. Vista has a daughter. Suit up for adventure! Hmm? Oh, you wanna see? There. Yes. All the badges. They want all the badges to release my granddaughter. Your life's work. Yes, yes it is. How can you give them away? You can't destroy them. What choice do I have? What else can be done? No, this won't do. This won't do at all. - Sir? - Hmm? Miss Maya insisted that you stayed at Hyperion Hall until her return. Tell me. How long have you worked for me? Oh, 10 years, Professor. And in those 10 years have you ever known me not to do whatever I wanted? No, sir. Although I do appreciate your concern, Lucy. I'm Lucy, sir. Hmm? I'm Lucy and she's Marian. Right, yes. Yes, I knew that. Ah, okay, right. Evening, Professor. Hmm, Ares. Well, well, well, I should have guessed. We were beginning to wonder if you were ever coming back. I could be mistaken but I think this may be your first time in a room with a gun. Yes, you might be right about that. So. Kidnapping eh? I learned from the best. Oh it's amazing what other people's kids can get done for you. Isn't it? Yes, well I'm not entirely sure what it is you've gotten done here. Oh, I've gotten the world famous Professor Mandulbaum to hand deliver my Titan Badge. Oh, I have it, yes. I think I'll take it now. No, no, no, I don't think so. He doesn't get it, does he? He doesn't understand what it's like. You triggered something in us, Professor. There's no going back. I can't live like them. Look, Ares. I want my badge. There's nothing more to say. Why don't you take the guns off of them? Because if you think about it logically, they're really in the same boat as you. I still need them. You think I'm stupid? I can't just steal my own badge. Then what? Live the rest of my life in hiding knowing the whole world is after me? It's no secret how you feel about Vista, Professor. She's the most hated person in the world 'cause of you. If you hadn't seen it for yourself you would have never believed she wasn't the one to blame. And Ansel, this guy wants his powers back more than anyone. His life's pathetic. A gift of an old fool. Look, Ares. The badge. It's beyond repair. Let me see it. I'm not sure you want to, but all right. That's all of it. Why would you do that? Make me another one. No. I'm afraid that's quite out of the question. You'll make me another one! Or I'll kill everyone in this room! You're not going to kill anyone, Ares. When did you get it? Wait. Okay. I think I get it. Ooh. Shots fired, shots fired! Squad A, come with me. Squad B, maintain the perimeter, keep those people back! Goddammit, Garrett, come on. Give me my gun, give me my gun! I don't wanna miss the show. All right. Ugh. Stop, Vista. Wait, just wait. I would never hurt her. You know that. I had no choice, I needed it back. Vista, it's him you're angry at. It's the Professor! He did this. Ruby, darling. Go in that stall and lock the door. That's it. Now, block your ears and sing our song. I'll be right there. Ansel! Hey! Oh, it's good to see you. Wait. Where's the Professor? Professor? - Professor? - Professor? Professor! Professor! Maya! Ansel! Medic, I need your help. Get someone over here, right away. No, no, no, no, no! No, Dad, Dad. I need you to look over here. Stay with me. But paramedics were reportedly seen rushing Professor Ruckus Mandulbaum, the world famous leader of the Hyperions, believed to George Washington University Hospital where he remained overnight. He is now back at home in Hyperion Hall, recovering where thousands of fans and supporters have gathered to share their messages of love. Sorry, Ansel. I have so, so many blueprints. It's okay. No, its not okay. Hey, Ruby Red. Let's give your mom some time to talk to granddad, okay? All right, come on. Bye. Hey. I don't know what to say. I love you too, Dad. Just like your parents at home, I sometimes need to help my children fall asleep. When counting sheep doesn't cut the mustard for my girl Vista, I sing her this song. Now arriving at 7th Street Station. This is the last station on the red line. Please mind your step upon exiting the train.
