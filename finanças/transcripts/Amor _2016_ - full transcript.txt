Want some cake, Mom? Want some cake? She doesn't recognize you. How long has she been like this? It started gradually. All of a sudden she started speaking French, but there are moments when she is lucid. Roni didn't tell me. We couldn't find you. But before this happened she talked about you all the time. Didn't you, Rachel? Rachel? Rachel, show Daniel the picture you have in your purse. The picture. - The picture? Yes. This is Lila. Move, move my hair out of the way. Have some tea. What is it? - Lemon verbena from the garden. It helps you sleep. Enough. I could use a good night's sleep. Do you still dream a lot? I don't dream, Mom. I live my memories. I don't dream. My baby. Time is dragging on. Hate this life. I can't take it anymore. Patience... Every night The moon looks down At the flowers that bloomed In the garden The blossoming hyacinth Our little garden Every night The moon looks down Alice! Stop shouting! I'm not deaf. You're so tense. Relax. Softly. You used to beg me for a massage. I used to. Albert, tomorrow it will be 3 years and 6 months. -I know. Maybe if we hadn't left Paris... - Don't start that again. God, this is so cruel. - Be quiet! God is not cruel. Our daughter... Why? Why? God has His reasons. He has no reason. No reason! Your God has no heart. He has no compassion. Put that down. Stop... - Don't tell me what to do! I don't want to see it. You're not staying the night? - Not tonight. Why not? Because... I'm going home tonight. So how about a quickie... - Stop! You idiot! I know you. - No... You don't want to start all over again? - No. And your brother will be here any minute. Did he tell you how long he's staying? No, I have no idea. No clue? No, he doesn't say much. Does he talk about Lila? - Lila? I told you, he doesn't tell me a thing. Okay then... -Hey. He kept asking about you. - Oh yeah? -Yeah. Are you back for good? No, just for a few days, I have this thing I have to do. What thing? Never mind. Not now. Are you at least staying a while? Why, am I in your way? What's wiping with you? EwoL| jnoA si sii|_L What do you want? The gas station outside the village >Â®rsale. I checked it out, we could ma e lots of money. We should buy it. Where will you get the money? E can sell the vineyards. Who's "We?" You and me, the heirs. What about Mom? - Don't worry, I'll get Mom to sign. We're not selling the vineyard. Stop thinking with your head. I'm telling you, it's a good deal, we can make lots of money. We can work together. Listen to me. I won't sign and Mom won't sign. You're making a mistake, brother. For 3 years no one even knew where you are. I run this farm alone, Ltake care of Mom on my own. You think you can come here once in 3 years and tell me you're not selling? Tell me, why is Mom in an old folks home? Why? - You have a problem with that? -Yes. Why? -Then you stay with her. - Why is she in a home? Answer me! Because she's sick, you moron. Go see her when she's asleep, get her to sign a form so you can make tons of money. If I don't remember If I don't... Hurry up, we're late. What's the rush? - She's waiting for us. -I'm sorry. We're all she has. Good morning, beautiful. - Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Lila. - Good morning, Dad. How are you? Fine, and you? - Fine. Did you sleep well? Like an angel. How did you sleep? Fine. Do you need anything? Can you move my hair? It's bothering me in back. I'm thirsty. Interesting? - As usual. A little more. That's enough. I met your red headed friend, the one that wants a nose job. -Zofia. Did she get it done? - No. -No? Not yet. - No. She really wants to visit you. Tell her I'm traveling overseas. You will one day, sweetheart. I'm going to do a trek in Nepal. Are you coming, Dad? The family wants to come too. - Stop it, Mom. You can't isolate yourself like this. - I don't want to see anyone. -Alice, change the water in the vase. Okay. I'll be right back. I'm not going anywhere. Dad... come closer, I want to tell you something. You remember when... I was little and I used to cry, you would take me in your arms and say: "Don't worry, my child, "Daddy's here, Daddy will always be here." I am here, my child. Do you want to tell me something? Help me, please. I can't take this anymore. This is a nightmare. I pray to God. - This is not about prayer. This is my life, I am lucid, my mind works, I know what it will be like in a year and 10 years from now and I don't want this. Do you hear me? Why can't anyone respect my wishes? Our life is in His hands, praise God. He decides who will live and who will die, my child. We must believe in him and ask His forgiveness for the sins we may have committed. What sin did I commit? I didn't commit any sin and I'm not going to ask for forgiveness from anyone. You're a pharmacist, it would be so easy for you. I'm begging you, Dad. I'm down on my knees pleading with you. What you're asking is against my faith. You are my only daughter, I love you like a father should. My love for God goes beyond. You breathe thanks to Him, praise God. I pray that He will have mercy on you. Forgive me, my dear child. What lovely flowers. Would you like to drink? Blessed is the holy Gdd. Good evening, Eli. - Good evening, Albert. How is she today? The same as yesterday and the day before that. Eli she can't endure her life anymore, she wants to die. My heart bleeds for her. Pray. You must pray. I pray from morning to night since this happened. Why doesn't God hear my prayers? The ways of God are mysterious. Eli at times I have doubts. I have dark thoughts. Her life is in God's hands. Every other thought is sacrilege. A sin towards God. Only He has the right to determine who lives and who dies. Albert, believe in him. Be strong. He is a merciful God. Praise God. - Praise God, amen. I have to go now. You stay here and pray hard so that God in heaven take pity on her. Amen. Thank you, Eli. - God is merciful. Heal us, God, and we shall be healed Save us and we shall be saved For You are our glory Heal our illnesses And our pains For You are a healing and faithful God Blessed a healer of You're so stubborn. She doesn't want you. Go pick on another fly. Go! Relentless, huh? Look, over there. You're not listening to me, huh? This is private property. Is it yours? It's the family's. You're Daniel, the artist. Yes, I'm both. I'm Mira. I live with Stella. - Oh yeah? I'm her cousin on my mother's side. Oh yeah? I work in her coffee shop. You're a waitress? No, a singer. I do events and.. Oh yeah? - Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Do you have anything else to say besides "oh yeah"? You do have.. A soothing voice. That's the first time anyone's said that to me. Really? - Really. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Hey. How's it going? - What's up? Look what we have here... Hey! I see you've met. Yes, by the sheep. By the sheep? - Sure, by the sheep. Doesn't sound too romantic. I was walking in the field and I saw her picking oranges. It starts with oranges and ends with legs wide open. Hey! - Watch your mouth! I'm going to change. - I'm coming with. -Okay. Daniel Well? -Well? You like her? She's okay. Cheers. Daniel is very nice. He is? You like him? He's not my type. Not your type?

Thanks, you too. - Thanks, I'm going back out. -Okay. Hey, dude. Hey. Wake up. You're in my way. - What? -You're in my way. Good morning. Stella's not here? No, she's on the other side. So, is this where y pai t? Very nice. - I used to, yes. Don't you want to paint my portrait? Do abstract art. What does abstract mean? It means.. The faces I paint can turn out crooked. You mean, like Picasso? Picasso was a god, I'm just Daniel. That's true. Stella showed me articles about you in the paper. Oh yeah? - They say you're... talented, original. Oh yeah? Oh yeah, oh yeah. So, do you like? Like it here. It's very nice. - Thanks. Hey! Well, here's Stella. What are you doing here? Was looking for you. N here? -Yes. Uh huh. The door was open so she thought you're here.

Should I invite Daniel? - What for? He lives here. Still... Didn't you say he's not your type? I was just saying that. Okay, then forget about it. Why? He's not for you. I'm not intelligent enough, is that what you're saying? I didn't say that. - Then what? He's not for you, that's all. And you're annoying, that's all. So are you. Lila. Lila! Lila! She's choking on her saliva again. - She does it on purpose. Lila, open your eyes! Lila! Lila! Open your eyes! I'm getting a pulse, she's not breathing, I'll start CPR. Lila! - Lila! I won't let you die, you hear me? Open your eyes. Lila! Lila! Open your eyes. Look at me. Look at me! Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. You shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. I'm a doctor. I hate doctors. I don't. Stop. Oh my... The wheat's almost ready and we don't have any workers. Ola! You ain't heavy, you're my brother. Where are the workers? You need money to pay for workers. Oh yeah? - Yeah. Why didn't you come last night? Where to? Mira's birthday party. Did you see her? What are you going to do? What are you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about. For 2 years she's been isolating herself, she tried to kill herself 3 times, that's why she's in the hospital. Understand? At least she's under supervision. Have you seen her? No, I haven't. See her mother sometimes. Does she know I'm here? I don't know, I didn't tell her. Don't want anyone to know I'm here for now. Got it. Then what? What? Why did you come back? I'm your brother, you can talk to me. Listen, there's nothing you can do for her. All the specialists say it's a lost cause. It's irreversible. - Fine, I get it. For 3 years you've been wandering like a lost soul from one country to another. Detached, lost. It's time you thought about yourself. Start over. Start working and live. Can't you butt out for once? Okay. I'll stay out of it. But you have to forget her. You can't help her. Her mother even went to court. It didn't help. The religious establishment forbids euthanasia, it's a crime. The religious establishment. - Yes, that's right. Yeah.. Want me to braid your hair? It suits you. Yes, braid my hair. Why not? I have a date with the pillow. Oh, I forgot I have this birthday party tonight. How's life on the outside? The same. Everyone is trying to get somewhere. Where do you want to go? I want to get married, have kids, come home from work to a husband who loves me. Yes. Loved Daniel. Daniel? - My man. Loved him more than life itself. You never told me about him. Where is he? Enough. Sorry. I'm going to get the moisturizer. - Okay. Okay, time to go? Sweetie, I'll turn the TV on for you. - Don't. I'll turn the TV on. - Don't turn the TV on, Mom. There's a great movie... -I don't want to watch a movie! Don't turn the TV on! Thank you. You can't isolate yourself like this. Mom, stop. - Your friends want to see you. Come home with us. -Stop it! - I'm begging you... We'll take you home! I don't want to go home! This is my home! How many times do I have to say it? I don't want to see anyone! You can't spend your whole life in here. That's enough! Let's go! I can't take this anymore. I'm taking her home. She doesn't want to leave. You heard her. Then I'll force her. - You can't. Our daughter doesn't want to live like this. I won't let her die, you hear me? Turn the car around! - We can't go back tojhe hospital. She doesn't want to4ive like this, you have to respect that! Said turn the car around! Come on, let's give thanks to God for saving our life. I want nothing to do with your God. "Blessed are You, God, "Who bestows good things upon the unworthy, and has bestowed upon me every goodness." Don Quixote Don't be so naive In this world, child There is no room for dreamers Don Quixote Wake up for me You will always be My knight I will find a job 'll work in a hote With the money I make I will build us a palace It's all for you Don Quixote Don't be so naive In this world, child There is no room for dreamers Don Quixote Wake up for me You will always be My knight Thank you. Where are you going? Are you okay? - I'm fine. You know, you're starting to piss me off, little brother. I can't get a word out of you. You think I don't know what's going on in that head of yours? You think I'm stupid? Or maybe you think you're better and smarter than me. You're wrong. I'm not the fool you think I am. I know why you came back. I know what your plan is and I won't let you do it. Shut up. No, no, I won't shut up. I won't let you do it, you hear me? I won't let you spend your life in jail. There are lots of fish in the sea. You're an idiot. -I'm an idiot? - Yes. -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. I'm no idiot. - Yes, you are. Listen, I know you, I don't want you to throw your life away. This is no abstract painting, it's life. You hear me? That's right, run away. My feet are killing me. That was some night, huh? Yes. Did they like the song? Like it? You blew them away. Couldn't you tell? Daniel didn't like it. Why do you say that? "Why?" He bailed in the middle of my song. Mira, you have to forget about Daniel. Why? Because Daniel isn't the man for you. You keep saying that. Why? I don't mean to insult you. - But you are. Because I don't understand why the hell you don't get it. What? That I'm this fucked up waitress and he's some acclaimed artist? No, it's not that. - Then what? Then... -Talk to me, I'm not stupid. Let's calm down, okay? - I'm calm. Talk. -Okay. Daniel tried to kill himself. What? Yes. Way before you started working at the coffee shop. Why? Because of a woman. Who? She's... A girl from the village. Her name is Lila Frizer. She... She was beautiful. She had the body of a goddess. She taught folk dancing. She was a gym teacher too. And? And... one day there was this terrible accident. A drunk truck driver crashed head on into her car and... he was killed instantly and she's paralyzed from the neck down, for life. That's awful. Yes And... Daniel and Lila were madly in love, this happened just before their wedding and... 2 months later Daniel tried to kill himself. He couldn't stand the thought of his beloved suffering and helpless. And that was it. Then he left the country. Why did he come back? Daniel's mysterious, he doesn't... He doesn't say too much. Does he still love her? She's in his body and soul. Well, I had a rough day. This is a sad story. I'm going to bed. Goodnight, little one. - Goodnight. Hi, Mom. Hello, Roni. I'm not Roni, I'm Daniel. I'm Daniel, Mom. I brought you prunes. I don't like prunes. - You love prunes. I do? - Yes. Of course. It's good! My sister is getting married today. Mom, Aunt Rivka lives in France. When I met your father, she was so jealous, oh la la. I came to say goodbye. He was handsome. He was handsome.. Mom, I'm here to say goodbye. I won't be coming anymore. You're hurting me! I'm sorry. The Czech author Milan Kundera said that when he was a boy he loved to bang on the piano, the finest piece of furniture in his home. Mom, give me another pill. Another one? Won't that be overdoing it? I can't sleep, give me another pill. Okay? Go on. One day he made an amazing discovery. The C-minor chord. He liked the combination of sounds so much Kundera adds that not often during his life did he enjoy music as much as he did when playing that simple chord. He was so thrilled because it was he playing that chord. For him this was a new experience under the sun. I want to sleep. Goodnight, Mom. Goodnight, my sweetheart. Are you done reading to her? Is she asleep? -Yes, Doctor. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Who's there? Lila. Daniel? Turn on the light, let me see you. It's you. I'm not dreaming? - No, you're not dreaming. Hello. - Hello. I sensed that you're here. A few days ago I smelled your scent. Come closer. Come. Love it. Crazy about your scent. It's the cologne I bought you, remember? - Of course. I put it on every morning. Why did you come back? You promised me you wouldn't. I missed you. You have to learn to live without me. I missed you, you nut. What could I do? Me too. I dream about you all the time. All the time. I live to dream about you. I dreamt about our tree a few nights ago. Have you seen Of course. - You have? -Yes. Is it there? -Absolutely. - Yes? -Yes. T still has our initials on it? T sure does. Really? - I touched them with my hand. What about our shack? Is it there? It's still there. -Yes. Remember how we used to sneak in? We made love there for the first time. Was so scared I couldn't move. But it wasn't your first time. How many girls did you sleep with before me? No. -Two. - You lie. -Honestly. -Yes? That's all? - That's all. -Now... you'll meet a lot of girls. - I don't want to. You have to, my love. You have to. You have to live your life. You have to move on. Daniel... I have nothing to give you, my love. Look. I'm worthless. You're worth everything to me. Kiss me. A few nights ago I dreamt that we're on a trip. Yes, I travel a lot since I can't move. Should I tell you about it? - Of course. We're going to... the beach. It's deserted, just you and me. It's an amazing beach. Sunny and warm and... the sea is rough like I like it and then... I want to go in the water. You want just the opposite, as usual. That's not me. - Oh yes it is. No. -Yes it is, and how. So I go in alone.. I'm swimming and swimming and... suddenly I'm swept away by this wave, I get caught in a whirlpool and... I get lost, I call out to you from the whirlpool and... - That wasn't a dream. It happened in Portugal. You got swept away, you cried out for help. I ran to the fishermen, we got in a boat, the boat broke in half, I'll never forget it. -That's right. That's right... That's right. It broke and you swam towards me. Right. We were attending your show in Lisbon. Yes. -Yes. We went to that fish restaurant the night before, where they grill the fish on the beach. - Oh yeah. -With that chef and his pot belly... Right. -We called him "Teddy Bear," he looked like a teddy bear. -Teddy bear. That's right. The chef that looks like a teddy bear, that's funny. He had the smile of a little boy. - This constant smile. It was annoying. One of your paintings. Yes, the one... you sold to.. I didn't sell it. I exchanged it for two plane tickets to Paris. -Yes. Paris was so much fun, remember? I had such a good time. It was un. Being with you on the streets I grew up on, where I spent my childhood. I love you. I love you. I love you so much. I'm tired. I can't take this anymore, my love. I don't want this body anymore. Enough. I want to go. I want to take this memory with me and leave. I want to take the taste of your kisses and... your scent. I can't keep my eyes open. Tell me you love me. I love you. Again. I love you. Again. I love you. - I love you. You are my love. Kiss me. Hello? Yes What happened? We'll be right there. Come quick, we have to go to the hospital. Come quick! "Lila Frizer" And rise from the dead.. "Blessed are You, God, reviver of the dead." -Amen. "May His great name grow exalted..." Amen. - Amen. In the world that He created as He willed. "May His salvation blossom and His anointed be near." -Amen. "During your lifetime and days speedily and very soon and say Amen." -Amen. "May His great name be blessed, praised, glorified and exalted "extolled, honored, adored, lauded, blessed be He." -Amen. -Amen. "Above and beyond all blessings, hymns, praises and consolations." -Amen. "May He who makes peace in heaven grant peace upon us and all His nation." - Amen. I'm glad she saw you. Thank you. The doctor on call says that you were the last one to see Lila. Yes I read to her, she said "goodnight" and... fell asleep. She said "goodnight?" - Yes. Gave her a kiss and left. Then I saw the doctor, I said "goodnight" to him. Yes, I'm the last person who saw her. But you didn't sleep there. How do you know you were the last person to see her? -I know. How? No one came to visit my daughter in the middle of the night. No one? - No one. No one? - No one! Why are you refusing an autopsy? My husband is religious, he will never approve it. Are you religious? That has nothing to do with it. Please sign your statement. Daniel! Hello?
