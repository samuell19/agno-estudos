(light festive music) - Okay people, 10 minutes til showtime! We're on in 10, is she almost ready? - I need five minutes. - Put more highlighter, I want my eyes to pop! - I got you. - Do you know how many people are gonna be tuning in to today's show? Well, I'll give you a hint. It's a lot. (stylist chuckling) Are you excited about today's guest? - Yes. I love her books. "Midnight on the Mind" was by far my favorite. (slow paced music) - You look nervous. Why are you nervous? - I don't know. - Neither do I, you've done this a billion times before. - I know, it's just, every new book I get the jitters. You know, with each new book they always ask. - No, they're not gonna ask. Don't worry about it, I already took care of it. - That Conrad, he sure knows how to melt a woman's heart. (blonde giggling) - He sure does. (imitates purring) - [Stylist] Right? I think you are pretty much-- - Okay, we need to go now. - Okay, you're good. Got it. - Now, put this on. I know it's cheesy but people love Christmas and people are nicer when they're filled with that holiday spirit. Even Ms. Betsey Goldmen. - We're on in five, you ready? - We're ready. Perfect. (women giggling) (upbeat music) - Rise and Shine America! Welcome to this beautiful winter morning here on Rise and Shine America! Coming to you live from New York! I'm Betsey Goldmen. Well I am so excited to announce our guest this morning. From the pages of her books, she has melted the hearts of women from across America. So please give a warm welcome to the mother of modern romance novels, Jennifer Monroe! (people clapping) Oh, it's so great to have you here. Thank you for coming. - Well thank you for having me. - So, I know you've been asked this many times, but I just have to ask before we go on because I know we are all dying to find out the answer. Who is Conrad? The one you're always writing about? - What? - Oh, come on. It's just us girls. And the entire country I guess. We have all fallen madly in love. Who is the mysterious Conrad? - Well, it's hard to pinpoint. Just like all my characters, I gather inspiration from everyone I meet. Our Conrad's inspired by many people. Sadly, he's fictitious. Sorry ladies. - Hmm. I'm not buying it. That answer seems rehearsed. - Well, that's the answer I have. I don't know what else to say. - Well, it'll just have to be a mystery for now then. Oh. What a lovely Christmas pin. Someone's in the holiday spirit. - Who doesn't love Christmas? - The Grinch. (Betsey laughing) So, any plans for the holidays? - Yes, I'm going home to visit my family this year. - Oh, how lovely. Well, we wish you the best holiday season filled with love and inspiration. And for everyone here and everyone tuning in at home, we wanna thank you so much for your time. And remember to buy Jennifer Monroe's fabulous new book, "Winter Nights and Music Delights." It truly is a magical gift this season. My name is Betsey Goldmen, and on behalf of myself and the entire crew of Rise and Shine America, have a beautiful day. (phone vibrating) - Hello. - I watched your interview. - Betsey Goldmen is something else isn't she? - Yes. Not my cup of tea, but you looked great. - [Jennifer] Thanks. - You're leaving soon, right? Don't wanna miss your flight. - No, I'm packing right now. I'll get in tonight at midnight. - Gosh, that's late. - I know, it's the best I could do. - I suppose. Johnny will be picking you up. We're all excited to see you. It's been too long. - 'Cause all those years you made me feel guilty for not coming back home to visit finally paid off. - A mother's love dear. - Okay mom, I really gotta go though. All right, I'll see you soon. All right? - Okay, travel safe. - All right, love you, bye. - Oh thank goodness. I thought that phone call would never end. What do you say, one more round before you leave? Hm-hm? - You know you can still come with me. - No, no, no, no. Don't do that. - Do what? - [Male] Well we were supposed to be in Fiji for the holidays, but you canceled. - Yeah, but for a very-- - I know, I know. Family matters. I stand by your decision. However, as I've told you before, Lucas, will either be in Fiji celebrating the birth of Christ or here in New York, the city that I love. - Fine. - Oh, oh baby. Please don't be sad. You know what I can do for you? I can leave you something to remember me by. And I guarantee, it will leave you completely satisfied until the duration of your trip. - Oh, okay. Do you think you could not eat on my bed and give me a ride to the airport? - All right, you win. - Only with you. - I'll go change. You know, if we wait here any longer you're gonna miss your flight. And eventually these guys are gonna ask me to move, or they might just straight up ticket me. I mean, who knows in New York. It's nice to see you smile. Relax, okay. You're gonna be fine. - I just wish you'd be there. - I know. Go home. Enjoy the time with your family. I will be right here when you get back. - All right, I love you. (airplane whirring) (light festive music) - All right! - Wow. - What? - It's the same as when I left it. - Yeah, mom wouldn't let us touch a thing. She wanted it perfect for you when you came home. - I'm gonna go to sleep. - [Johnny] Yeah, yeah. I'm glad you're back. - [Jennifer] Me too. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Oh boy, what a long day. - You're gonna need to put that back on. - [Lucas] Hm? (ominous music) - We'll need protection, don't you think? (Lucas chuckling) (phone vibrating) (solemn music) (slow festive music) - Good morning! - [Mom] Oh my baby! It's so good to see you! - Hi Mom! - Hi. You look nice. - Thanks, I found it in the closet. - I think that's your sisters. - Oh. Where is she? - She's with Caleb. They took Willie to see Santa. I have to get busy, the Blake's are gonna be here any minute. - Gonna sit down? - [Jennifer] Mom's into football? - Yeah. Obviously you've been gone way too long. (baby babbling) (slow paced music) - Enjoying the islands. Jerk. How's my beautiful little girl? (light upbeat music) Come here. Come here. I got ya. I got ya. Here's your toy. Here's your toy. You are so special. (doorbell ringing) Hey. - Hi Mr. Berry, I am so sorry that I'm late. - Oh, no worries. Come on in, it's cold out there. - Thank you. - Hi honey. - Okay, so I've fed Gemma. - Hi Honey. - [Woman] Okay. - Which means she'll probably zonk out and be done for the rest of the evening. - Oh no! - Now, I put emergency numbers on the refrigerator. - Okay. - And of course, I will have my cellphone on me just in case. And let's see, is there anything else? - Mr. Berry, don't worry. I've done this before. - Okay, thanks. But if you do need me-- - I won't. - Okay, but if you do-- - [Woman] Mr. Berry, please go! Have a good night. My mom says that you deserve to have a good night. - Okay. Well thank you. - [Woman] Yeah. - All right, bye Gemma. - Say bye Dad! - [Woman] Oh! - [Mark] Thank you! - Bye, see ya, have fun! Hey, let's go hun. - He's coming right? Did he get a babysitter? - Yes. Yeah, I believe so. It's be good though, haven't seen him in a while. - Forever. He's gonna miss this game. - [Male In Back Top] I know. Oh, there he is. - Hey guys. - Good to see you man, it's been a while. - You too, absolutely. - Yeah. - What's going on? - [Male In Green Top] Good to see you man. - Man does it feel good to be out. - [Male In Green Top] We've got beer for you. - Nice, thank you. What did I miss? - Just all the good parts. I'm just kidding. - You're good man, it's just the start of third quarter. - Cool. - [Announcer] The Pittsburgh win, 2015. (light festive music) - [Jennifer] Hey Dad. - Hey, my girl! Come here! Hey, come on, get in here, game's just getting started. Come on guys. Hey, you remember the Blake's from next door right? - Of course she remembers us. We've known her since she was in diapers. - Well, it's been a while. Was thinking maybe she might have forgotten. - Oh yeah. Maybe you're the one that's forgotten in your old age. - No, no, no, I remember you guys. Thank you, it's nice to see you again. - [Everyone] Touchdown! (everyone cheering) - [Male] Oh nice. - Knock knock! Hi everybody! Hi Jenn! Lily you remember your Auntie Jenn, yeah? - Hi. - Hey. Can you say hi? She's just a little bit shy. - Okay. Well, I'm gonna go do my stuff. So I'll see ya later. It was nice seeing you. - You too, bye. - [Jennifer] Hi Caleb. - All right, let's go. Go see Grandpa, go see Grandpa. - [Male] Go, go, go! - [Announcer] He'll take it in! - [Both] Yes! - Yes! - Nice! - [Male in green Top] Sucker! Now, now, don't cry. - I'm not crying. - Well you'll have another chance to win next year. - Who is Conrad? Tune in tomorrow for a recap of our exclusive interview with romance novelist, Jennifer Monroe. And some never before seen footage, and hopefully get to the bottom of the question that is on all of our minds. Who is Conrad? - Who is Conrad? Who is Conrad? OMG, who is Conrad? My wife loves these books. Can't get enough of them. Apparently, Conrad is the man every woman wants. This guy is basically perfect. Annabelle is constantly saying, "Conrad this, Conrad that. "Oh my God, you're such a jerk. "Why can't you be more like Conrad?" Blah blah. - [Male In Black] Dude. - [Male In Green Top] What? - Jennifer Monroe. Jenny Monroe. - You keep repeating the name, it doesn't mean I'm gonna get it. What am I missing here? - Mark's girlfriend, all through college. - You dated Jennifer Monroe the novelist? - Kind of. - Oh man, how come you didn't tell me! Ooh, do you have the hookup? My wife would love me forever if she got to meet her. - Guys, it's not a big deal. That was years ago. And no, we don't really even talk anymore. - Yeah. Not that big of a deal. Except that she took every single one of their intimate moments, added a happier ending and made it into a successful book series for all the desperate women to enjoy. - What? - Well I wouldn't quite say it like that. - Wait, give me a sec. - [Male In Black] The dude's Conrad. - He's Conrad. - [Male In Black Top] Yeah, he's Conrad. - Mark is Conrad? - Yes, Mark is Conrad. - Guys, can we please relax? I am not Conrad. - [Male In Green Top] You're not? - We dated in college for a while, and that's it. And it didn't work out. - Mark graduated a year ahead of her. Their relationship became long distance and she dumped him. - [Male In Green Top] Damn. - And now she makes a whole lot of money writing about him. - Hey. - I'm sorry. Writing about Conrad. - [Male In Green Top] That's cold. - [Male In Black Top] Yeah. - Guys, those stories could be about anyone. - Yeah, but, they're not. - Okay, can we please just move on? - Yes, absolutely. Look, moving on. - For sure man. - [Mark] Thank you. - Tyrese! - Hey baby. - Don't pretend like you didn't get my texts. Game's over, time to leave! And hurry, I'm double parked. - I gotta go. Before she makes me walk home. - Go, get out of here man. - [Mark] See ya later buddy. - [Male In Black Top] Wow. - Wow's right. - I gotta go clock in man. You good? - Yeah, I'm good. I gotta take off anyway and run some errands. - [Male In Black] Okay. - These are for you. - Don't even worry about it, I got ya. - [Mark] Thanks buddy. - Whoa! Jennifer Monroe back in town! Getting in touch with her roots, I like it. What can I get for ya? - I will have a cinnamon latte. Almond milk, no sweetener, no syrup. - Okay, got you. So no sweetener, we can do, no syrup, eh, probably not gonna taste great, but we can do it. Unfortunately, we don't have any almond milk. - Fine, coconut milk? - No, but I can interest you in some whole milk? - No. What else do you have? - Whole milk, half and half. - That's all you have? - [Barista] Yup. - I'll just have a coffee, black. - Excellent choice. Would you like to add a slice of cherry pie? Maybe with our famous homemade Anne's pie filling? - Sure, why not? - Awesome, the cherry pie's my favorite. - This so bitter. - We've got sweetener in the corner. Help yourself. - [Mark] Hey man, how's it going? - [Barista] Hey Mark. - Good to see ya. - Good to see you man. Oh dude, you've just missed it? - Missed what? - Jen was here. Like five minutes ago. Jennifer Monroe. Oh snap. You didn't know that she was back in town? Yeah, she was here. She's back. Oh man. What if she was here and you were here at the same time she was still here. Awe man, if you guys saw each other, the tension, the chemistry, the lack of chemistry, god. - Hey, can I get a coffee? - Yeah. Yeah I can get you a coffee? Just a normal coffee? - [Mark] Yeah. - Cool man, I'm gonna go get it. (door knocking) - I am so sorry Mr. Berry, I was just resting my eyes. You okay? You look like you just saw a ghost. (girl laughing) - Yeah, no, I'm fine. - Well Gemma was perfect as always. - [Mark] Oh good, good to hear. - Yeah. - Hey, can I offer you a ride home? - No actually, my birthday was a few days ago and I got a car. - Oh, well happy late birthday. And congrats. - [Babysitter] Thank you. - [Mark] Get home safe. - Thanks, will do. Goodnight! - [Mark] Good night. - Hey sis. - Hey. - Whatcha doing? - Just checking emails, what's up? - Just wanted to make sure you were okay. - I'm fine. - Yeah, you seem fine. - Jill looks good, I don't see much of a difference. - Yeah. Yeah, she's doing well. She's strong, you know, and complete. Yeah, if that makes sense. - That's good. I'm glad. - Yeah, me too. Hey, you going skating with us tomorrow? - Skating? - Yeah, it's Lily's birthday, you know, and she wanted to go ice skating, so. - I totally forgot. I guess I have to go. - Well you don't have to go. It'd be nice if you go. And she is your niece and all, so. - Yeah, I guess. - No, no she is. - I know, it's just, she doesn't even say hi. Do you think something's wrong with her? - You know, in her defense, she doesn't really know you. (solemn music) - Yeah. Whatever. - Hey, don't beat yourself up. You'll get to know her soon enough. But I'll see you tomorrow. - [Jennifer] Goodnight. - [Johnny] Goodnight. (light festive music) - Here for Lily's party? - Thanks. - Sure thing. - Oh this looks so beautiful. - She's gonna love it. - Yeah, come on, let's get going. - Yeah. - Hey, we're gonna grab our skates, okay? - All right. - All right, so you're really beautiful. Hey, those are so beautiful! - Hey, you're here! - [Dad] Fantastic. - Oh my gosh, she's gonna love these! - Okay, let's go. - Yeah. - [Jennifer] Can I help? - Yeah actually. Why don't you put some more plates near the cake. I think that'd be great. - Sorry I'm late buddy. - It's all good. - [Mom] They look happy don't they? - [Jennifer] Yeah they do. - I tell ya, some people are just meant to be. - Grandma! Come skate with us. - [Mom] Coming. ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday dear Lily ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ - Blow 'em out. - You got it, blow it out. - Make a wish. - All the way. All of 'em, all of 'em, all of 'em! - One more, one more! (everyone applauding) (light festive music) - What ya looking at? - [Jennifer] They did good. - Yeah they did. - So, what about you? Do you have a lady friend? - No. No, no. - [Jennifer] Well do you date? - Not at the moment, but I'm just too busy. Working a lot. And helping Caleb and Jillian take care of Lily. Yeah, I mean, I'll get back into it when the time is right. I just feel like there's more important things going on. - Yeah. - [Johnny] So you gonna come skate? - In a minute. I gotta finish my cake. - Come on, I better see you out there on that ice. - [Jennifer] All right. - All right. - You will. - [Johnny] I better! - Everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, just, I just need to rest for a second. - You sure? - Yeah. - Here baby, lean on me. - Thanks babe. Hey, I'm really glad you're here. Come here. - You sure you're okay? - Yes, yeah, get out there and skate. Never too late to learn how. Go! No time like the present! - Here. Lean on me. (Jillian coughing) - Hey, didn't I see you at the coffee shop last night? - What are you doing here? - Well, I work here and I live here. What are you doing here? - It's Lily's birthday. - I meant, what are you doing here in Wisconsin? - It's Christmas-time. - It's been Christmas before and you've never come home, so what are you doing here? Wait, are you actually staying for Christmas? - Yeah, is that a problem? - No, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think you were ever gonna come home. - Well I wouldn't if it were up to me, but my family refuses to leave from this place, so here I am. - Okay. I got ya, I got ya! (Mark laughing) You never could skate. This is great. You can't run like you did at the coffee shop. You're stuck here on the ice with me. You have no choice but to chat. - Oh no, we can skate in silence, 'cause I really have nothing to say to you. - Really? After all this time? - Nope. - Nothing at all? - Okay Mark, I will play this game. Did you have something in mind that you wanted me to say to you? - I wanna know why you're here. - I already told you! - Wait, did Flynn tell you about me and Laura? Is that why you're here? - Who's Laura? Look, I don't know what's happening right now, but I'm not one of those girls that stalks their exes on social media just to get insight into their life. We were done seven years ago, you screwed up. Chapter closed. So whatever fun you and your floozy Laura are having, kudos! Now if you'll excuse me. Do you know where Mom is? - She went to bed. - What do you have there? - Epsom salt, I can't feel my feet. - I don't know how salts can help you with that. - Very funny. I need a bucket. Do you know where she keeps 'em? - I don't know, beats me. - Check with Jill, she's upstairs. - [Jennifer] Ow. (Jennifer groaning) (solemn music) (door knocking) - Hey. - Hi. - Different isn't it? - How do you feel? - Tired, but happy. Lily had a great day. I'm really glad you came. - Yeah, me too. So, when did you move back in with Mom and Dad? I had no idea. - A couple months ago. Things have just been coming in waves so it's just been easier on everybody to have Mom and Dad close by. A little bit of stability. And Johnny too. Lily loves her uncle Johnny. What are you doing back here Jennifer? Don't get me wrong, we are so happy that you're back, and I would love to think that you're here to see me, but, and I really don't think that's the case. It's never been a reason before. - Well I was supposed to go to Fiji for Christmas with Lucas. But you know, something just didn't feel right between us, so I canceled the trip and I told him I needed to come back home and that there was an emergency. - Interesting. - [Jennifer] How so? - No, just your family's an excuse when you need us to be. - Oh, Jill, I didn't mean it like that. - No, we'll take what we can get. Honestly, Jen, we're just happy to see you. I saw you with Mark today. Come on. Tell me everything. - It was nothing really. - [Jill] Come on. - [Jennifer] Can I at least get a bucket first? And I couldn't stand up. So bad. - But I saw you. - [Jill] Everybody saw you. - And then he asked me, he's like, "Did Flynn tell you about Laura?" One, I don't know why you think I'd still talk to Flynn. And two, I have no idea who Laura is. I don't know why I would care. Wait, what? - Nothing. - I saw you! Now you have to tell me! - [Jill] Okay, just don't tell him I told you. - Okay. - Mark started dating Laura pretty soon after the two of you broke up. I mean we all thought it was a rebound, of course, but it wasn't. They were in love and six years went by, they were still together, and she got pregnant. - Oh my God. - Yeah. We were excited for him, we were, but Laura was really weird about it all. - How so? - I don't know, she would just steer the conversation away from it. She'd kind of like half smiled when you congratulate her. It was noticeably off. It turns out she never wanted a baby. Mark had to beg her to keep it and I guess she agreed reluctantly, but as soon as Gemma was born, she left. - Oh my God. Wow, that's a lot. - Yeah, it is. But it's good. No, he's doing great. And Gemma is the cutest little kid you've ever seen. Except for Lily. What? - I just... I can't believe he's a Dad. I mean, a single Dad at that. Just wouldn't have pegged him for it. (slow paced music) - Good morning love. - Good morning Mom. - How did you sleep? - Great actually. - Good to hear. A little bird told me that you and your sister were quite chatty last night. - It wasn't me. - It doesn't matter who it was, it was nice to hear. - What are you doing? - I'm making a last minute grocery list. I've got lots to do. Clean house, bake cookies, run errands. - [Jennifer] Did you need my help? (Johnny spitting) - I would adore your help, thank you love. Would you mind going to the store for me? - Sure. You guys gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Sure. - I need to get a latte anyways, the store's on the way. - Bye. Can you believe it? She offered? Well then, I better start cleaning. - Hey, how can I help you? - This used to be a market, right? - Yeah, Pete's. My husband and I bought it a couple months ago. - Huh. - Comfy sports bar, it's always been our dream. You okay? - Yeah, sorry. Sorry, a lot of memories here. My ex and I would come and suck the helium out of the balloons. Sound like a cartoon for 20 seconds. Drove Pete crazy. - I can imagine. - Where is Pete, is he around? - I'm not sure. Store went out of business a couple years ago. Building was vacant for, gosh, almost a year. But I'm sure he's off enjoying retirement somewhere in the Florida Keys or something. - Yeah. - Well look who it is. - Hey Kim. - [Kim] And you brought the baby. Hi Gemma. - Well, we actually just came to drop these off. - [Kim] And he cooks. Ladies, he's a keeper. - Well my Mom cooks and she knows how much you love her poppy seed cake. - I do, thank you! That's so thoughtful of her. I'm gonna go put these in the fridge. - Hey. - Hey. - Look, I owe you an apology for yesterday. I'm sorry, I shouldn't be so mean to you. And I called Laura a bad word, and for that I'm sorry. - Apology accepted. - Just like that? - Well what am I supposed to do? Curse at you? Make a scene? - I-- - We're not in college anymore. - Right. Can I buy you a drink? Look, I don't when I'm gonna be back here and I'd really like to catch up. Please? - Okay. - [Jennifer] She's perfect. - Yeah. I lucked out. - Is it hard? Raising her by yourself? - It might be too early to tell yet. But I had no idea this is how my life would turn out. It is what it is. - Did you ever think about not having her? - The thought never once crossed my mind. Anyway, enough about me, how's life treating you? - I guess it's, it's good, you know? (phone vibrating) - Excuse me. I am so sorry, I have to go. - Oh. - But, hey, you can say no if you want, but if you'd like to, I'd like to take you out tonight and maybe finish this conversation? - I'd love that. - Yeah? Great. I'll pick you up at seven? - See ya then. - [Mom] Yummy. - [Dad] You better watch her or we'll have none left. - Oh there she is. Oh my God Jenny, where have you been? I thought you'd left and went back to New York without saying goodbye. - No, I went to see an old friend and had some coffee. - [Dad] Get your gear miss and come on, the game's about to start guys. Don't be late. - No, no, no, I'm not watching the game tonight. - [Mom] Have you lost your mind love? - No, I'm just having dinner with my old friend. So if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready. - Jillian, now that you and your sister are speaking again, you're gonna have to find out details. - All right, I'm on it. - Go. - An old friend? Jenny, who you going out with? - Mark. - Mark. - I ran into him at the coffee shop and we talked. Stop that. (slow paced music) - What? - Smiling, stop smiling. - Oh what, I can't smile now? - Ugh, nothing to wear. Everything I brought was for lounging around the house. Ugh. Lord knows none of these high school dresses are gonna fit me. Well I guess I'm going in this. - Hmm, mm-mm. - What? - Come with me. - [Jill] Come on. Come on. You look beautiful. - Thank you. (phone vibrating) - Here you go, it's cold. Perfect. (doorbell ringing) - Hi Mr., whoa! You look nice for a game. - Change of plans, I got myself a date. - Oh! (slow festive music) - I planned it out, trust me. - All right, all right. Who's ready for this game? - I am. - Me. - Can you say it a little more convincing next time? - I don't really wanna be here. - Baby! It's date night. The important thing is that we are together. Now, where is Mark? Is he on his way? (phone vibrating) - What? You gotta be kidding me? He's not coming anymore. - What? - Yeah, it says "Sorry guys, last minute "date with an old friend." - Date? - Old friend? - Looks like everybody's having fun tonight but me. - Yeah, being third wheel isn't exactly my idea of fun. - Great, I'll leave then! Problem solved! I'd rather be at the movies anyway. You two, enjoy your dates. - Wait, baby! - It's cool baby. I see you at home. - Well that worked out. What? What's wrong with you? - Are you going to share a Margherita pizza with me? - I guess. - That's right. At least you'll be a cheaper date. We're going dutch. (slow paced music) - Wow, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - Are you ready? - Let's go. So where are we going? ¶ Is this what it ¶ - It's a surprise. ¶ Feels like ¶ - You know I hate surprises. - Oh, I know, I remember, ¶ To shake off the ice ¶ but trust me. This is good. ¶ Around my heart ¶ ¶ Although the stories are told ¶ - [Mark] Your eyes are closed, right? - Yes. (chimes chiming) - [Mark] You ready? - [Jennifer] Yes. - Okay, open them. Welcome to Candy Cane Lane. ¶ We've made ¶ ¶ A brand new start ¶ ¶ I don't have to be alone ¶ ¶ 'Cause this Christmas ¶ - It's amazing. - Yeah, pretty cool huh? - Very impressed. Wow. ¶ I don't have to be alone ¶ ¶ 'Cause this Christmas ¶ - [Mark] It's good right? - [Jennifer] So good. ¶ You're my home ¶ - This is pretty amazing huh? (phone vibrating) - Sorry. Hello? Mom, slow down. I can't understand you. Oh my God, okay. I'll be right there. Jill's in the hospital. I gotta go. (somber music) - Can I help you? - I'm looking for my sister. - Name please. - Jillian Monroe. - [Nurse] And your name. - Jennifer Monroe. - Jennifer Monroe? - Yes. - You look just like your picture! I can't believe it's you. I just love your books. It's my special time during the day, let's my mind wander a little bit. If you know what I mean. - So good to hear. - Oh my. Oh my goodness me. Lush sandy hair, soft facial tickle. You must be Conrad! - No, I am not Conrad. - He is not Conrad. - Nope. - [Jennifer] Definitely not. - Oh, no. Not Conrad. Even though you match exactly the description in the book and you are exactly what I imagined. - Look, we're here to see her sister. Can you tell us what room she's in please? - 206. - Thank you. Hey. I should probably wait outside. - Lily's gonna have to come see you. - I know. - The sooner the better. - I know. - Jill-- - I just want it to be under happier circumstances. Hey Jen. - Hey Jill. - I'll be outside if you need me okay? - Okay. I'm glad you came. Come in, sit down. (Jen laughing) And the Root beer all over Mom's white carpet. I thought she was gonna kill us. - Me too. - Ladies, keep it down. The whole floor's sleeping. Oh. And our Conrad had to leave. He didn't wanna interrupt. - My gosh, I totally forgot about him. - I'm sorry. "Our Conrad?" Did she mean Mark? She did. She did. Oh Jenny, I'm so glad. I'm so glad it's Mark. That boy never stopped loving you. Mm-mm. He just made a mistake. You know, people make mistakes Jenny. But you deserve to be with somebody that makes you happy. You deserve the best. - You deserve the best. If anyone in this world does, it's you. - [Jill] Jenny-- - It's true. You're a better person than I am. - Oh, don't say that. - It's true. You're always thinking of others. You listen when other people talk to you. You contribute to charity-- - So do you. - I write a check. Anyone can write a check. You actually care. You donate your time and your heart, and you see the impact that your being has on others. You have a little girl and she's so beautiful. And she has the whole world ahead of her. And she needs her Mom. I don't know why God's taking you away from us. It's so soon and I'm so angry at Him and I hate that I am-- - Hey. It's okay. What you're feeling is fine. Hey, I was mad at first. I was mad. Why, why me? I know that I started to feel selfish. - What? - I just think if I go, it's just because I'm needed in heaven. Like, maybe I'll be more impactful as an angel. I know that sounds childish but I have to believe it. It's better than asking all the reasons why. Don't you think? - I'm so sorry I didn't visit sooner. (inspirational music) - [Jill] It's okay. You're here now. (doorbell ringing) - [Mark] Hey, what are you doing here? - Hi. I didn't wanna go home. You hungry? Like old times? - Come on in. How did you even find a place open this late? Everything here closes at 10. - Everything does close. I had to beg Mr. Donaldson to let me into the store. - I mean, all those years of veganism, you must've been really craving marshmallows and cocoa. - I just wanted something that took me back to the good times. - What, like frostbite? - No, like being here. Embracing the earth. - Yeah, probably not a lot of starry nights in New York like there are here huh? - [Jen] Not like this. - How ya holding up? - It's weird. It's been a while since I've been back. - I know. - A lot has changed. I'm so angry as myself. It was just so much easier staying away from this place. And the town. My family. You. Now that I'm back, I don't know, I just regret not visiting more often. - Oh, I mean, you were pretty busy melting the hearts of millions of women with the adventures of the great Conrad Jacobson. - Oh my God. (Mark laughing) - [Jennifer] How much have you heard about Conrad? - Oh, I don't know, I'd say everything. - Everything? - It's all over the TV stations. - This is true. - I know I tease you about Conrad, but you should be proud of yourself. I mean it. You made a life for yourself outside of this town, and that takes guts. - Thank you. - Even if it was at the expense of sharing our intimate details for the entire world to enjoy. - I'm sorry. I'm not sure I know what you mean. - Yes you do. - [Jennifer] Help me out. - Conrad. - You're not Conrad. - [Mark] Yes, I am. - No you're not. - Come on. Wearing cowboy boots, falling in love on the dance floor? Chasing fireflies on the summer nights. Skinny-dipping on a dare. Jen, that was you and me. - You read my books? - All of them. (slow paced music) Multiple times actually. I enjoy them, they remind me of our beginning chapters. Except for like a slightly skewed time capsule. They really remind me of the good times we had. Except we didn't have quite the same ending of course. Jen, I'm sorry I cheated on you. - It was years ago, it's fine. Long distance is hard. - Yeah, I know, but I don't think I ever apologized, so, I'm sorry. - Me too. (light music) (slow paced music) - That's good. - Thank you man. - [Male] It's a little fruity. - [Male] No, it's good. - It's like a cocktail. Oh, hey man. - Hey guys. - Yo. - [Male] Whoa! You get your teeth whitened or something? What's with the smile, it's nauseating. - What are you talking about? - Dude, stop, you're creeping me out. - I had a good night, that's all. - Looks like a really good night. - What? Did you? - With Jennifer? Tell me it was Jennifer! - She came over last night. - Yes! It's about time man. - Looks like Jennifer finally hooked her Conrad. - It was one night. - [Flynn] Yeah, but y'all will see each other again right? - Yeah, I'm actually on the way to the hospital now. Give her a little moral support. - Being there for her sister and her family at a time like this? That's a real man. - I knew you guys would get back together. I just knew it! - Thanks. Well I came by to tell you guys I can't join you for the game. I tried texting both of you. - Oh yeah, my phone died like an hour ago. - Wifey took mine. I'm under the microscope again. - [Mark] Oh boy, what did you do? - I don't know. Annabelle's going crazy. - All right, well I gotta take off, so enjoy the game. - All right, have fun buddy. - [Mark] Thank you. - [Tyrese] Bye Conrad. - Run to her Conrad. - Run to her! (Tyrese laughing) (phone vibrating) - Hey Donna. - Jennifer, thank god I got a hold of you. - Why, what's wrong? - I wanna talk about your book tour. I talked to the publishers and they wanna put you on a worldwide tour starting this spring. Did you hear me? I said worldwide, three continents. - Yes, yes, that's fantastic. Tell them yes. - Okay, great. I just, we'll go over all the details later, I just needed a yes to move forward. And now that all that business talk is out of the way, how's home? - It's good, it's good that I'm home. - Okay, awesome. Hey, wish I could talk more but my other line's ringing, so I really gotta run. - All right, I'll see you then. - There you are. I've been looking all over for you. They're requesting us in the room. (somber music) - Why, what's wrong? - I don't know. - [Jennifer] What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. Everyone, we have an announcement. - What's happening? - As you know, the last couple days have really tested the limits of our family. The news we've heard hasn't really been the best, but Jillian and I have been talking and we agree, we wanna get married. We'd like to do it tomorrow if that's okay. - Tomorrow's Christmas. - [Dad] A Christmas wedding? - [Taylor] If that's okay. - I like it. Welcome to the family. - Christmas. A Christmas wedding is perfect! Oh my God! I've got so much to do. - I know, I'm sorry. - Congrats guys. - [Caleb] Thanks. (everyone chattering) - [Mom] Is everyone excited about tomorrow? - [Men] Oh yeah. - [Mom] Finally, you can call me Mom. - No, I won't. - [Johnny] Do not call him Dad yet. No. - [Caleb] I'll work up to it, I'll work up to it. (doorbell ringing) - Excuse me. (ominous music) - [Lucas] Hi. - Can I help you? - You must be Mrs. Monroe. It is so lovely to finally meet you. Jennifer's told me so much about you. I'm Lucas, Jennifer's boyfriend. - Of course, of course. You must be freezing, come in. - [Lucas] Oh yes, thank you so much. It is crazy out there. - Of course I have room for dessert. Come on, who doesn't right? - [Mom] Looks like we have a visitor. - Hello everyone. Hey baby. - [Jennifer] Lucas, what are you doing here? - You weren't picking up and I got so worried and Donna told me what was happening with your sister here. - [Jennifer] She did? - Yeah, I wanted to be here for you. You don't look happy to see me. - No, no, no, I am, I'm just surprised, that's all. (Johnny clears throat) I'm sorry, I'm so rude. This is my family. That's my brother Johnny. - Hey man. - My soon to be brother-in-law Caleb. - How ya doing man, how ya doing? - That's my little niece Lily. - [Lucas] Hi. - You've already met my Mom, that's my Dad over there, and this Mark. A really good friend from childhood. - Well it is very nice to meet you all. I've heard so much. She's told me so much. - You must be hungry after your travels. - [Lucas] Yes, I'm starving. - Let me get you a chair. - [Lucas] Thank you, thank you so much. - Actually, he can take my chair. - Dear, you don't have to leave. - No, it's okay. I was about to get out of here anyway. I promised my babysitter I'd be home at a reasonable hour. - [Lucas] You sure buddy? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Thanks a lot man. What was your name again? - [Mark] Mark. - Mark. Nice to meet you Mark. - Nice to meet you too. Thanks again guys, have a good night. - We'll be seeing you tomorrow, yes? - Well... Hey everyone. - [Everyone] Hey, hello. - Wow. You look, you look so different. You're happy. - [Mark] Yo! - Hey! You're home early. - Yeah. So, how was she? - Went to sleep like an angel, stayed asleep like a miracle baby. What happened? - Awe man, you're not gonna believe it. Her boyfriend showed up. - Boyfriend? - Yeah, he flew in and surprised her. - Dang. I'm sorry. - It's okay. This week was just way too perfect to be true. - [Tyrese] Yeah. - I mean, I don't even know what I was thinking. It's been over. We both live our own realities now. - Maybe. But there's only one Conrad. Oh yeah, that came for you, from the State. (phone vibrating) (Tyrese growling) - [Mark] What's that about? - Annabelle wants to know when I'll be home. Can I stay for a while? Hang? Guy time? - Yeah, of course. - Great. - You good? - Everything's fine. She's just been overly annoying to me lately. She'll never know you came home early. - All right, in that case, what are we watching? (slow paced music) (baby crying) (light music) - It's okay. It's okay baby. It's okay, it's sleepy time. What do we got here. Help me open this. - Today's the day! All right guys, it's wedding day! Time to celebrate! (solemn music) - So it's official. Signed, sealed, stamped, delivered. How's it feel? - Honestly guys, I don't know. - I think this is good. - Yeah? - [Tyrese] Yeah. - Yeah. Guys, who leaves a baby? Leave me, I get it, but walk away from your own child? That I don't get. I knew it was coming. But that, that right there makes it real. What am I gonna do? - What you've been doing. - I mean when she grows up. How am I supposed to guide her through things? Guys, I don't know the first thing about teenage girls. - Man, you're thinking too much. You got time to figure it out. - Yeah, besides, you have us. We're not going anywhere. - Thanks guys, I appreciate it. - Flynn. You're not on a break, I need you on the floor. - I was just.. See ya guys. - See ya buddy. (phone vibrating) - What? What's wrong? - Annabelle says hurry home, I need to talk to you. Urgent. I gotta go. Hey, weren't you supposed to go to a wedding today? - I'm not going anywhere. It's just gonna be a Father Daughter day today. - Okay. - All right, call me later. - [Tyrese] Will do. - All right Gemma, let's get out of here. - Who's your date? (Lucas growling) - Just some guy I'm seeing. - He's cute. - Yeah. - Is Mark coming? - I don't know. I haven't heard from him. - Sorry. - This is your day, let's talk about happy things. Like how beautiful you look. - Oh, thank you. - [Dad] Are you ready? - Almost. (gentle music) - Baby, what's going on? You okay? - I'm pregnant. - Are you being serious? - Yup. We're having a baby. Please say something. - Whoo! Thank God. I thought you were leaving me! You've been acting so crazy! - What? - Never mind, grown rambling. This is the best Christmas ever. We're having a baby. - We're having a baby. - I love you. - I love you too. (bells ringing) (gentle music) - You look beautiful. - Thanks Dad. - Can we open Christmas presents now? - [Johnny] Sure thing Lily. - Yay! - Wow. All right, is there anymore in there? Anything else in there? (phone vibrating) - Hello. Yeah. Lisa, what did I tell you about calling me? Okay, text is better. Yeah. Yes, I know it's been a while, but I've been out of town remember? Mm-hm. Yeah, I know. I know. You know what, I'm actually at the airport right now. Yeah, so I'll be back soon. Yeah, yeah, tomorrow. That's great. (Lucas laughing) Yes, I'm excited too. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow then. Perfect. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, love you, bye. I mean what is taking them so long right? These people are difficult. - Do you always say I love you when you hang up the phone? - What? - The women you were just talking to, Lisa, you just said "I love you." - Oh well, not like that. We just work together, you know. She's new to the office. I have love for her as an employee. You know, real smart girl. Real hard worker. Not like nothing we have baby, come on. Okay, she wants to hang out when I get back. You know, pick my brain on logistics, talk business, all that boring mumbo jumbo. Told her I'd take her to lunch, keep it casual, just give her some pointers, help her out. If that's all right with you, of course. - Yeah, lunch, dinner, whatever you want. Whenever you want. - [Lucas] Thank you baby. - Because we're over. - Wait, what? - You must think I'm an idiot. Do you think I believe those lies? (slow paced music) - [Lucas] But it's, baby-- - Stop. - We are now boarding for flight with service to New York. - Our chapter's over. - What, no? Jenny, come on. - Please have your boarding pass out. ¶ Close the book ¶ ¶ Put it down ¶ ¶ Never needed you around ¶ ¶ I'm headed back ¶ - How was Ibiza? - Ugh, fabulous. But I'm so jet lagged. - I bet. Make sure you drink a lot of water too. - Oh, can I help you? - Betsey, it's always a pleasure. Just so we're clear, there's no talking about her sisters passing. Just about the book and the tour. - I wouldn't even think about it. - Great, thank you. - I need you, we're on in 10. - She's almost ready. Okay. ¶ No turning back now ¶ - [Announcer] A spin and escape and drive! He'll take it in! - Dude. You don't look good. - Man, what's wrong with you? You walk around like there's a cloud hanging over your head. - Guys, I'm fine. - Obviously you're not. - Give it up for one of our favorite guests. The iconic book writer, Jennifer Monroe. Oh, thank you so much for being here today. - Guys, can we turn this please? - No man, I wanna watch this. - Yeah, it might be interesting. - All right, fine, I'm out. - I know it's been a tough year for you with your sisters passing and the launch of a new book tour. - It's been quite the year. Bittersweet you know? I'm definitely ready for the year to be over. I'm ready for a new chapter. - Well, her book tour starts next week. Check online for a signing near you. And it gives us more information about our beloved Conrad than ever before. You won't be disappointed. Check out Jennifer's new book, "A Kiss on Candy Cane Lane." And her tour coming soon to a city near you. - She's coming here December 7th! I need to get her to sign my copy. This book was by far the best one in the series. Over a romantic winter's fire, we learn that Conrad is actually a soulmate from times past. Who entered her life to make her believe in love again. Only after that she admits that she believes in love, he disappears from earth because his purpose was fulfilled. A true angel. It's actually heartbreaking, but so powerful. - Wait, wait, wait. Over a romantic winters fire? - Yes! It's the best! They finally admit to each other that they're soulmates! Always have been and always will be. - Sounds like a certain experience our friend had with Miss Monroe. - [Annabelle] Wait, what? - It's Mark. Mark is Conrad. - Mark is Conrad? - [Flynn] Yup. - Mark? - Yes Annabelle. - [Annabelle] Why didn't you tell me? - What? 'Cause you love Conrad and all that. - So? - [Tyrese] So? Yeah, he's perfect! I can't compete with that. - Well, if you would just-- - Guys, guys, guys, focus up. Let's regroup. What do we do next? - Look, let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we need to read the book. Thanks babe. Well then we need to find out when that signing is happening. - From the moment our eyes met, my heart began to melt. A warm sensation filled my body, overtaking my sense. Is this what it feels like? After years of longing, the holes in my soul began to mend as the pieces of my heart were restored. Embraced in Conrad's arms and just one look into his eyes, I knew that I was safe and that I was home. (audience applauding) - All right, we will open the floor to questions. - I've got a question. - [Jennifer] What are you guys doing here? - You thought you could get away with this. - Get away with what? - Oh, oh, so that's how it's gonna be? Let's see here. "I knew that moment, we were soulmates. "He loved me, I always loved him, never stopped. "We kissed under the hue of a cozy fire. "It was a beautiful night, "and worth the weight of what seemed like a lifetime. (chimes chiming) "Conrad came back to me, I couldn't let him go. "I wouldn't." She wouldn't, your words. Did you mean them? - Sir, you're gonna have to calm down. - He's sorry. He's just passionate. Look, Jennifer, we all know that Mark is Conrad. (women gasping) Did you mean anything that you wrote in this book? Because right now we've got a friend who's been literally moping around for the last 11 months thinking that he lost you for good. Did he? Did he lose you? Because if there is even a possibility that you still love him, and want him like your book says, then you need to come with us right now. - You guys, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - Wait! I'm coming with you. - What? (upbeat music) - Yeah! - [Jennifer] I'm sorry Donna, I have to. - What am I supposed to do with all these people? - I don't know. You'll figure it out. You always do. Thank you guys so much for coming. I'm so sorry, I gotta go. But I'll be back. I'm gonna go get my Conrad. - Come on, let's go. - Okay, what do I do now? - Go get him woman! - Mark! Mark! - Jen? - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Your friends came to get me, they're really great. I'm babbling. I miss you. Like really bad. I wanna be with you forever. I love you. - I can't tell you how long I've waited to hear you say that.
