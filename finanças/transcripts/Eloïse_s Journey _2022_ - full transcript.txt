Hold on a second... Where am I? Wow, I've been crying. Isn't there a phone in here? "Eloïse Leroy, 4 bis, Place de la Chapelle". Eloïse Leroy... That's not my name. My name is... My name is... Shit, what is my name? Can we help you? No, thank you. Fucking asshole! At least I remember assholes. - Hi. Ok? - Hi. Yeah. Your cat's mewing. He must be hungry. Really? But... It's cos I'm back late. No worries. Goodbye. Bye. Mum! Honey! Hold on... Cut it out. Hello, kitty. Hello there. Anybody here? Ok... The girl's single. Password: "Eloïse Leroy." All right... "Leroy, Eloïse." Shit. Date of birth. Don't panic. See doctor, find phone, seek witness, computer code. Packed schedule, babe. Beddy-byes now. Sleep will bring it all back. Right? ELOÏSE'S JOURNEY Shit... - Hello? - It's Olivia. What's up? You're two hours late. Actually, I'm a bit queasy. Are you sick? A little. Call in that case. You know that. Is your mobile dead? Good job you have a landline. It's so 20th century. You'll be in tomorrow? Yeah. Where? Yeah, of course. Bring a sick note for Fred. Fred? Yeah, of course. But... - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Shit, shit, shit! Where does she put her pay-slips? What the hell? What's this dress? Who am I? Who the hell am I? Prescription! I need a sick note. Right, kitty? What on earth's my job? Maybe I work in a bank. Surely I'm not a riot cop? No. What is it this time, Ms Leroy? It isn't easy to explain. Like last time? That stifling feeling again? No. What is it then? A sore throat? Backache? - A stiff neck? - No. - As usual, nothing's wrong. - As usual? Six sick leaves in six months show consistency, Ms Leroy. Well, yes. So what do I put this time? Exhaustion, nausea, dizziness, we've done. Amnesia. Have we tried that? No, sorry, but I won't put amnesia. Amnesia's serious. I am serious. Doctor, I... You won't believe me, but I've lost my memory. My mind's a blank. Ms Leroy, do you know what my sister says? Respect limits or they bite. I swear it's true. I can't remember what my job is. I couldn't remember my address. What is my job, please? You sell books at Gibert. I sell books at Gibert. Ok. I've forgotten all about myself. But the rest is ok, apparently. I mean, I know who Vanessa Paradis is, but not if I have brothers or sisters. I don't know if I'm straight, bi, but I know Veuve Cliquot is a brand of champagne. Two weeks' sick leave. I need time to get sorted. No. No way. I'll give you one day's sick leave and prescribe some tests. Symptoms of retrograde amnesia. What does that mean? What you say you have. Trouble recalling personal information or memories from before the amnesia. Could it be Alzheimer's or a tumour? Anything's possible. The trouble is, with amnesiacs, if people know about it, the social circle distances itself. Amnesiacs isolate themselves and end up losing their jobs. And, without a strong family unit, they frequently end up homeless. Or even in a psychiatric hospital. Come on, Ms Leroy, get to work! 1 - Either I'm a total slob 2 - or I'm a hypochondriac. 3 - I work at Gibert. I think I'm probably a total slob who works at Gibert. I reinstalled it. It's good as new. But don't give a computer beer. It's no use. I found bits of kebab, brownies and bread. I get that. But not beer! I've learned my lesson. Guaranteed three months. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Hi, can I help you? Can you help... Actually, I wanted some information. I'm here to help. I was on that bench yesterday. And my phone was stolen. - Ouch. - Yeah. I wonder if you saw the guy who did it or something unusual. - Yesterday? - Yes. No. I wasn't here. I only closed up. My partner was here. He's left. For Nepal. For the summer. Could you ask him anyway? Sure, when he gets back. Because... If you want, I... Give me your number and when he gets back... My phone was stolen. You still have a number. You can't steal a number. Can you? No. You can change phones. See your provider with your number to get a new chip. They'll sell you a new phone. Yes, you're right. If it's backed up, you'll recover your data. That's right too. So... What's the number? 06? I'll come back. It's wiser. It's friendlier. Yes, it's friendlier. People rarely come back. Exactly. If you come back, ask for Moby Dick. That's what they call me. Moby Dick, ok. Bye. Using this door today? I've lost my job Has anyone seen it anywhere? Hello? Yes, it's Eloïse Leroy. You forgot your pass? Yes. No, save a little for tonight at your place. For tonight? Is 8 PM ok? - You bet. - Ok. Not getting out? Of course, yes. See you tonight then. You bet. The longest foreplay ever! - An hour down there. - An hour? - An hour! - You put honey on your pussy? He must've thought it was crêpe Suzette. You seem to rate the clit. The clit's a totally wild thing. Sorry, but the clit's overrated. The pressure... No one bothered about it before. Hi, Elo. Hi. Ok, but it's important. Leave it where it belongs. I have no problems with my clit. But they're such a drag. Media, guys, women, they're all obsessed by it. - Got any change? - No. I'm hungry. Elo, I forget what you told me. What are you? - What am I? - Clitoris or vagina? Hold on, I... I can't remember, actually. You try enough! When'll happiness come along... - Hello, Eloïse. - Hi. Are you better? Yes, much better. Thank you... Sonia. I think there's someone in your department. Oh, right. I'll go. Chin up. Hello. I've been thinking about what you said, about Love in Blue being cheesy. I didn't dare tell you, but I liked it. Yes, Love in Blue ... I haven't even read it. Are you sure it was me? I'm not senile yet. - Finish. - We've finished. See you soon, bitch. She asked you for another love story? Try to do picking and layouts. Yeah, layouts... Try to get it done today, ok? I'll need your sick note too. You saw Fred? I bet he didn't mention yesterday. - No. - He's cool with you. Go ahead, ma'am. Hello. Do you have Thirst by Amélie Nothomb? I prefer hardback to paperback if you have it. Amélie Nothomb, I like her a lot. In hardback... Let's check. I already did, miss. Let's see... Amélie Nothomb. I like her a lot. Don't you want another of hers? No, Thirst . Maybe it's elsewhere. Well, no, I'm afraid we've run out. But you didn't check your computer. Maybe it's in the stock. Miss... - Yes? - Can you answer me? This lady wants an Amélie Nothomb and the Goncourt winner published last month. Yes, of course. - You all read the same? - Yeah. - Try changing. - I don't know. This looks good. "A former alcoholic becomes a rabbi." It's powerful, symbolically very powerful. Why read Amélie Nothomb rather than this? Honestly. Eloïse? Is something wrong? Can you take me somewhere, please? Sonia, you have to believe me. I don't know what picking and layout is. - You know, that blond woman... - Olivia. Maybe. She asked me to do picking and layout, whatever that is. But Olivia is the N3. And Fred is the RD. What? Fred heads music, cinema and literature. Olivia is like his assistant. For God's sake... I must be having a nightmare. I'm off. Another crap joke. What? Sonia, what crap joke? Please, believe me. - Believe me. - Why tell me this? Because you're here. You saw I don't understand a thing. I'm in a complete daze. Don't tell anyone or I'll be fired. Unlikely, as you never speak to me. What? Me? - Me neither? - No. I tend to believe you as you never talk to me usually. Really? Why? Did we fall out? No, but your pals are Chloé, Vincent, Olivia, Fred. You hang with them. I'm invisible. Your memory's gone and I'm invisible. You aren't. It's an image. - You see me? - Yes, of course, sorry. I'm going nuts. So what do Chloé and Vincent do? The music department. They know all about you after a year. No, I don't trust them. Who do you hang with? I either have my 7-year-old or watch TV. Tried contacting your family? I found nothing about a family. No one called me. Maybe they're abroad. It's weird I found no papers at home. I just know I was born in Paris. I found someone's sweater and red striped T-shirt. And your phone? I got a new one, but I can't load it without my computer password. And Facebook? I looked. I'm not on it. No Eloïse Leroy with my face. I'm surprised. I didn't find myself. We have to go back. You lose your phone, forget your computer password and meet me, it's a great day! Isn't your colleague back? No. It's a long trip, sorry. I have a theory about passwords. I have a theory about passwords. Yeah? I'll tell you. Dog's name plus year of birth, first love's name and year I first had sex, lover's name and husband's year of birth... - What's the theory? - Nothing strikes you? It's not very moral? No. No one cares about that. My, me, mine. A password tends to be self-centred. If you forget it, you forget yourself in a way. It's a good sign. I like people who forget passwords. Ok, you can enter your new code. That way, you can synchronize your new phone. May I? There you go. It's all there. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Tell me, would you like to come to the aquarium to celebrate? It's open late today. The aquarium? Sorry, no, I invited a lift colleague to dinner... A work colleague... Fred. He's a colleague, like. Give me your number this time. I'll let my partner know... Well, I'll let you know when he's back. "Last update: 6 months ago." Shit! "Update phone, list contacts, read files, check email." Baby, I was thinking of you all day. Wait a second... You're in jeans? What's going on? - Hold on... - You're expecting someone? No, that's for us, for tonight. For dinner. For us? We're not having dinner. - Really? - Why would we have dinner? I have the North Europe Think Tank in two hours. Oh, right. Wait, please. What's the North Europe Think Tank? The what? What's that think tank? - You ask questions now? - Yes. Where's Miss Docile? Hold on. Sorry, can we have a quick drink first? We can eat, we can chat about stuff. Two hours is plenty of time. Actually, I was wondering... Where were the two of us at? Eloïse, what is this? Where we're at? That's not us. We keep it simple, rapid and light. We're not really together then? No. Neither of us wants that. It's not our thing. I mean, the candles... Can you see us being formal? No, all right, but... we can have dinner without it being formal. What do you want to talk about? The future? That very word makes my prostate swell. Let's talk about the future. Damn, I'm impotent. Hold on a second, the future isn't what interests me. It's... I'd like to pass... I'd like to talk about the past. About the past? What d'you want to know? For instance, recently, were we... You find me a little odd. No. Not especially. Do you find me absent? Can you develop that cos I... What did you think of what I said the other day? What? About my life and so on. The guy for the podcast? I said yes. I said it suits me. You won't tell me who he is? No... When the time is right. Well, in the meantime... Can't we get to know each other first? For God's sake, Eloïse! I'm gonna get annoyed. You're weird. Are you pregnant? - No. - Shit, you're pregnant! Not at all. All right... It's not going well tonight and I don't want that. Let's preserve ourselves. I want us to preserve ourselves. We work together, we get along, so... - Not staying for dinner? - No. It's not a good idea. Bye, Elo. So, Facebook, iTunes, Outlook... One of them has to tell me something. "Photos taken by Chester." Chester... Who's Chester? Why? It was a year and a half ago. A year and a half? Nothing before. Why no emails before then? William: "We'll meet soon, honey. I heard your message. I'll call you soon." William Delfino, producer and influencer. William Delfino. Do I know that guy? Kitty, stop that. UNIDENTIFIED YOUNG WOMAN. Thank you for holding. You didn't do a back-up to iCloud and as your last update was six months ago, we can't recover a thing. Do regular back-ups. I'm fed up of telling people that. Ok, the last six months but I... there's nothing on my account beyond 18 months ago. Maybe you rebooted 18 months ago. People can do that deliberately when they want to, I don't know, erase their past, start a new life... That's possible. Hello? What characterizes the Y generation? The community. Shared values through social networks, support of the same causes, need for peer recognition. So what do we do? An orgy? Chloé, stop. I said Y, not S-E-X. As Y generations love to influence their peers, we let them. We set up platforms where they can act. But we don't treat them like fools. On the tables, you'll find signs for the platforms set up in the store. Unwrap them and place them on your shelves. - Where's Sonia? - Sonia? Wednesday's been her day off for two years now. Are you ok? I've lost my memory. Let's report it to head office. Get to work. Since Olivia turned 40, she's looking at life differently. Before, it was, "Ibrahim this or that, Ibrahim left me, Ibrahim cheated on me." I adore Olivia but, frankly, what the fuck? I'm single too, ok, but that lets me. Go higher! Go higher! - Know what Fred says about Olivia? - No. She's sapiosexual but not classist. He likes that. Democrat. Follow Fred's example. I'd follow Fred anywhere for his ideas, but never sleep with him. Your cultural hang-up makes you fuck muscular guys with biceps not brains. It reassures you. Too bad for me. You're the only woman I could marry. Except your mum! Something wrong, Elo? You avoid us, you joke about his mum who just died... You didn't chip in for the wreath. We're pretty pissed off. Hold on, your... your mother is... Hold on, when was that? Did you let me know? You were here when I heard. The thing is, I forgot. Vincent, I swear. Otherwise, I'd have... But it slipped my mind. What's the problem? Snap out of it! What's wrong? Nothing. It's just we always hear about people dying. By hanging? Hanging? Oh, no... I don't believe it, sorry... I'm so sorry. It was her third attempt. Did you have people with you? Yes, Pablo came specially from Rennes... Chloé and Yveck came too. We had a sober and elegant ceremony. She'd have loved it, right? You bet. So, Elo, what's the problem? I'm menopausal. - What? - Pre-menopausal. It's very rare at my age, but it's happened to me. And so I... I have health problems, tests to do... It's messing up my mind. So, sorry... Sorry. You're still coming to the Pin-Up on Saturday with us? The old gang, with Olivia and Fred, to forget our problems. Will Chester and William be there? Who? And Sonia? I nearly fell for it! All right, Ms Leroy, I have some rather good news. No tumour, no early Alzheimer's, no concussion. Everything is perfect. What's wrong then? Technically, you have identity amnesia. Amnesia probably caused by a paroxysmal emotional trauma. Some like to call it Hollywood amnesia. - Hollywood amnesia? - Yes. You need to know what happened before that moment on the bench, which is where you say your trauma began. It's a total void. Don't you have any medication that could help me? That's the less good news. Traditional medicine can't do much for you. I can prescribe antidepressants, therapy sessions, but you need to trust in yourself. Identity amnesia is reversible. You need to find sensory stimuli. Live, love, make love. Go back to that bench. Keep investigating. Something will trigger it one way or another. Sensory stimuli... All right, over to me. Who Does What? Great game. Vincent, go on. Hold on... - Her! - Wow, really tough. - History teacher. - No doubt about it. Who only revises her lessons to make them non-binary. Like her clothes! And pissed off at the Education Minister and society. - Of course. - Her only limit: the hijab. Votes for the far left like you, Fred. - But less elegant. - For sure! And pottery. - Eloïse, come on. - Me? - Olivia's in shape. - I am too. You are, but Olivia's on top form. You don't recognize me? We had some fun last time. Chester? No. Then again, we never bothered with names. So shut the hell up! She has a slight hormonal problem. Ok, but I'm emotionally needy since Ibrahim left me. With a strong desire for a baby. Kids, routine... A passion-killer. My parents' example put me off for life! -With time... - Higher. With time, everything fades I thought about what you said last time. Being two is what matters. It's a political act. You're right, Fred. It didn't register right away. It wasn't until later. I dream of sharing a woman's daily life. You? You're kidding, Don Juan. Not at all. I'm a great romantic, you know. I don't just think with my dick. - Sure. - You bet. If I find someone special, I'm ready to commit. Marriage, a loan, a baby... - Yeah? - Sure. C'mon, Elo! Do Sonia for us. Do what? Sonia. Go on. Sonia! Sonia! C'mon, Eloïse! Do Sonia after seeing a movie she loved with her son. - Yes. - Please. - Please. - We love your imitations. Nice and uptight. I don't know now... Focus. Don't you remember? - Go on. - All right then. It was a great movie. The characters are so moving. You laugh a lot, deep in your throat. I recommend it. Time to meet my son from school. The joys of motherhood. There you go... Bye! - I love it! - Hold on... Why "deep in your throat"? I only know "deep throat". Cut it out. - No. - That's with Pablo! That's a different situation. You can say that? Sonia? It's Eloïse, from Gibert. Eloïse, right. Sorry to bother you so late, but there's no one else I can talk to. You've no idea how lousy I feel. Shall I come over? I can come. No, I'll come. It's ages since I helped a desperate friend at night. My ex is here, so he can mind Théo. I even imitated you. They say I do it really well. Really? Show me. No. It's ok, I can take it. "I can take it. It was a great movie. Very touching actors. We laughed. Deep in our throats." Not a great imitation. No, but it wasn't me, it was her. I hate her. You must have hated her too. Say it, Sonia. It's not that, but you were a carbon copy. Laughing and crying like them. Maybe that's why I was depressed, saw the doctor so often, slept around... Not necessarily. Maybe you like that. With that guy I saw? I don't think so. Where was the accordion? It was with the dress, hidden in a cupboard. - Still nothing on your family? - No. Nothing in your phone? No dad, mum, brother or grandma? Nothing. I rebooted 18 months ago and no one worried. No one would care if I died. I could kill myself now and no one would care. Weird you found no papers. You don't care either. Maybe... Maybe at one of her guys'. It seems she had quite a few... - She... You mean me? - Yes. Fred just wants to fuck. That's not having a guy. Chester is invisible, and William Thing is a trendy producer-influencer. I slept with him by chance, got clingy, and now he's fleeing me. It's ridiculous. Vincent is the one I pity. I think I was just like him. I spent my energy and brain power trying to work out how to be like them. Like this, not like that, that's sick, what do we think of that? Vincent's favourite words are "totally", "right"... He just agrees. Fred is radical and we all agree. Emails between me and Vincent: - "- Coming to the demo with us? - What's it for? Some awful law. Fred says we have to be there. See you there, babe!" veganism, intersexuality, #antispeciesism, pro Palestine, neoliberalism, gluten-free... You tend to do it all. That said, I'm for animals and two states. The girl's neutral. Even her job is neutral. - You hate our job? - No. But I feel more like an artist than a salesperson. What if my parents are dead? Well, we'll see... The only thing I share with the old Eloïse is Fred. I'm attracted. I'm attracted somehow. I can't help it. Maybe your body remembers he's a good lover. Why was your ex at your place? We actually get on well. We often have evenings together. He sleeps on the couch. Julien and I met when we were kids. We love each other. That's good. Or not. This is good wine. Those are the two things I share. Her taste in wine and Fred. I'll give you a bottle. What'll you focus on next? Chester, Delfino... I'm going to change my approach. I'll try to see who I am, truly, deeply, and maybe that's how I'll discover who I was. How'll you do that? You try things, you seek. You dare, like. A break on arriving? It'll only take a minute. Fred, I want a dinner where I can be myself with you, ok? Talk to you, get acquainted. I mean, why am I attracted to you? It's true, why? Cos I'm good-looking, political, a bit dumb, funny, but insatiably curious. - Yeah? - Just suggesting. For example, we could have dinner tonight. No, I'm having dinner with Olivia tonight. - What's up? - Why come on to Olivia in front of me? Cos I'm a complicated guy. I need girls who are special. And, well, deep down, you're... You're nice. Dressed like a little urchin... You're saying Olivia has something special? Olivia has a broken heart. She's ambitious like me. She's a few years older than you. And she wears very high heels. You're having a romantic dinner. It's to talk about the podcast. By the way, can I take her to the place where I scored with you? It's a great restaurant and... Yeah, I'm being a bastard. Yes, frankly... But a self-aware bastard. So half-forgiven! I adore you. You're very demanding, but I adore you. Ok, get to work. I'm your superior. But mostly a pervert. No! I promise you nothing. We made no promises. Did we? Transparent. Yeah, well... I think I found the restaurant's card. It's on my board. So what? I don't know... I'll plant a bomb there tonight. Try finding Chester instead. Chester sounds Anglo-Saxon and elegant. Maybe he's waiting for you in England and you've never called... Yeah, you're right. Chester. What's up with you? - Who? - My cat reacts to Chester. Chester? Chester? Chester... Shit, Sonia... Chester's my cat! Chester took your Facebook photo! It was my cat. It was a joke. She has a pathetic sense of humour. Hello? Too bad, I'll risk it. I'll have a drink and go to town. No. Have a drink? Find your inner self first. And what about William? He's too old. I'll impress him. Listen, Eloïse... No hard liquor. Really impress him. We need an audience for the podcast. Yeah, totally. You're right. We contact artists, we lock the programme for a month and we go for it. How about Kickstarter? Sponsoring? The French hate sponsoring. - That's true. - They see sponsoring as corruption. You're right. Was this planned? Not at all. - Sorry, Olivia. Sorry. - Hi. Sorry to spoil this new step with Fred. Your break-up hurt. But maybe you don't know... We have a thing that isn't quite over yet. I have a few things to say to him. Eloïse, this is a bad time. Fred, listen, I want you to know that... the one here now isn't the one you had before you, you see? In fact, do either you or I know who was before you? I'm not even sure if you or I know who the one here is. It's hazy, but I wanted you to know that each of my identities wants to spend some time with you. There's not a lot I'm sure of, except for one thing... All my selves want to spend time with you. Even so, they know you're a loser. All right, my final attempt. Remember to forget me. I'll think about it. Reflect like a mirror. I'll see. Remember to forget me. I'll try. Amnesia has the power of magic. Black magic... He's no fun! I'll see you tomorrow, ok. Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye. Everything's fine. I saw you from my window. I live up there. Were you at a fancy-dress party? I put this on, so you wouldn't feel uncomfortable. Want to come up for a drink? Come in. What's this? That's my karma wheel. Do you want to know what you were in a past life? Go on, turn the wheel. You were a sort of jellyfish under the ice-cap of a moon of Jupiter and you died at 98, when a sudden ocean current unleashed carnivorous plankton that devoured you in 23 seconds. Ok. Where do people sit here? Feeling better? Like a girl ashamed and humiliated by the man she wants to charm. Do you like being humiliated or... - Of course not. - That's not good then. Ever dreamed you were drinking a beer with an older you? No. You have? I've drunk a beer with myself in the future. I wasn't a pretty sight. But my mind was sharp. If your girl was sentenced to 10 years, would you wait for her? Sorry, your guy. No. Would you wait? Yes, I think so. I'm not sure, but I think so. Why all those photos? To travel. You travel with photos? I'm off to Yemen. Do you like it? Always look at ceilings. Look up. Manna falls from above. That tree's beautiful. Thank you. Was last night your biggest fail on a date? Gosh, yes. Mine was at a restaurant with a very pretty girl. I couldn't believe she'd agreed to come and, at one point, I hid behind this really big menu. Then I lowered it and I went "Boo", to scare her. She looked really uncomfortable. So I explained, "I went boo to scare you, but only to pretend I was scaring you." A big, big fail. A huge fail. You're a bit odd, you are. Not really. Just normally odd. I'll never be able to look Fred in the eye. At least I tried. The store guy put you up? - Yes. - Nothing more? No. He's funny and really nice. Are whales nice? Yeah. His name's Moby Dick, so I wondered. The accordion isn't your artistic field. Try drawing maybe... How do you know? Give it to me. No way... It soon comes back. You're the artistic one! Eloïse! Yes... I can resign. No, come on. No. Enough. I'll stop making a fool of myself. I don't want to! I don't believe your thing about the lightness between us. I'm not like all of you. I don't understand when you speak. Shit, I simply hate your attitude. - You don't... - I do! I've changed. I'm attracted to you. Did I ever lie to you? I'm a bastard, but did I ever lie? I'm a bastard, but is that all I am? Know the guitar solo in Hotel California ? I won't do it, but you remember? At first, I found it dumb and soppy. I had to listen 10 times to love it. You stunned me at the restaurant. I didn't realize. I couldn't sleep after. It's true. I was too dumb to see it. What you did and said to me is unique. I saw people's faces. Even Olivia said so. What you did is unique. I love making love. I didn't remember it made you so... You didn't remember? I did, but... I love it when you're tender like that. When it's not a position contest... I like that but... Wait, I have to do something. That's all you can say? No, but... I don't know. It's being here with you. Let's go to Clermont-Ferrand for a volcano sunset. No... - Moby Dick. - I'll call him back. - No. - Yes. - Hello? - No! -Eloïse? - No, this is her guy. Sorry, sir, I was hoping to speak to Eloïse. She's asking me to take a message. Well, tell her that my partner is back and remembers a few things. - He says... - Later. Yes, later. I'll tell her and she'll call you. Very good. My respects. My respects, buddy. The guy says, "My respects." Who's Mr Respect? It's complicated. He calls late, talks in riddles... "My partner is back"... Are you jealous? Yeah. You're jealous. Yes, I am. Cos this is serious now. I know it's you, Eloïse. The one I was waiting for. Your gentleness overwhelms me. You're like a perpetual discovery, see? I'm scaring you. - No. - I am, I lost you. No, you surprised me. But you didn't scare me. But it's true I also feel something stronger than myself. I want to see you tomorrow. And the day after. I want to see you all the time. Aren't you hungry? What do you think of the wine? Nicely structured, hints of spice, too rounded a tannin for me. Excellent. I never asked how you know all that. Tell me everything. Before, I didn't care, but now I do. There's nothing to tell. You're very private. You could say that. - Right. - What can I say? I didn't update my phone for six months so... And your parents? What do they do? Go on, you can tell me. Nothing shocks me. Free market guru, geodata agent, soccer player... Nothing shocks me. - Well? - They're dead. No, I'm kidding. Sorry. I'm kidding. Ok, excellent! So what do your dead parents do? Where did you grow up? In Paris. In Paris and... its surroundings, mainly. You don't trust me. I can see why. I wasn't classy with you. But, if we commit, I want you to tell me the truth. I believe in this love. Truth, trust... - Share everything and talk. - Right? Yes, of course, but... Actually, it's not that, but... For my parents, for instance, what can I say? They do technical jobs that no one understands, not even me. Dear Eloïse, your lovers before me? Who did you love most before me? Or who loved you most, if you prefer. Sorry! Eloïse, come back! I worship you, Eloïse! Are you peeing? It relaxes me. I told you I was ready to do it all. Marriage, a loan, a baby. Even if that's really tacky, Eloïse, do you want to live with me? Huh? Do you want to live with me? You can't imagine what it was. It was crazy, nothing like last time. He was so tender... It was... Sonia, we should all lose our memory at least once. It's magical. It's huge. Hold on. I'll call you back. Interested now? But Edouard isn't here. Sorry. Sorry. Moby Dick, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's try to reach him. Edouard, this is Eloïse. Hi! Moby Dick told me you may have seen... someone steal my phone. Someone stole your phone? Well, yes. I'd just like to understand. Fake News. I was outside. I saw everything. Why call it theft, as there was no theft? That's my question. Stop it, you'll freak her out. What did you see exactly? I saw you dump it in the trash. You sat a long time, then stood up and dumped it. No one stole it from you. Why on earth would I do that? -Because of William? - William? You shouted, "Fuck you, William!" Some kids made fun, shouting, "Fuck you, William!" Then you sat down on the bench and were still there when I left. So, I'll ask you again. Why are you so keen to find a thief? When there wasn't one. Well, because... Precisely. I want my phone. My life's in it. As I want to settle down with a guy, I really need my life. You want to settle down with a guy? But you... you like the idea of settling down? All right. I'll leave you. I told you everything. By the way, Moby, you'll be pleased, I found Macintosh SE disks. Ciao. See you. What is it? Like I said, you often find solutions by looking up. Why? Do you have a problem? No problem. Moby Dick... No, but... I don't know how to put it... I have to see things through with him. - We're closing, miss. - Please... There's a store nearby, down by Traitor's Gate. Right. See you. It seems I lost it over the old media guy, William Delfino. Maybe when he stood me up. Maybe he's the one I wanted Fred and Olivia to meet. No, nothing else. Except that Moby Dick is mad at me. Sonia, you've no idea how lost I am. Who am I? Where am I from? What's that? Hold on, I'll call you back. What's that there? "Blood group card." "Family records book." What? I'm the daughter of Mathilde Leroy and an unknown father? You don't have a dad? School in Montauban. If I grew up Montauban, why was I born in Paris? No number for a Mathilde Leroy in Montauban. Check my emails or contacts. Mathilde rings a bell. There's a Mathilde Joseph in your contacts. Nothing exchanged, but... Maybe she remarried. Write to her. And this? We already looked at it. Shit, she's answered me... So you have a mum? Yes. "My dear Eloïse, it took you a year and a half to find the way back to Montauban. We had given up hope. Come any time. We hope you're well. Your father and I are well, "but even better after reading you. Mum." I'd fallen out with her. Sounds like it. And I have a father. An adoptive one. Probably. Shit, I have to understand. Hold on, sweetheart. Fred, it's just a return trip. I'll tell them about us. Me too. Lots of love. What do you think they're like? That was it. That was it, shit! When you said you'd come by car, we were worried. It's a long drive. But it looks like it went well. Eloïse? You're so pretty! I'm really happy to have a mother like you. That's not what you said last year. Hello. It's kind of you to have brought her. Put your things in your room. I made the bed. Come here. Duras... Gone with the Wind. Nothing in common. With the Paris girl. I'm like a kaleidoscope. You're you, like. Why did I fall out with them? Can you help me get lunch ready? Will you tell them about your amnesia? What do you do, Mathilde? Didn't Eloïse tell you? I'm a child-minder at the local crèche. That's nice, isn't it? And Jean-Marie? He's a mechanic. Remember, Eloïse, an oaf's job you said before leaving. No, I... - I didn't say that. - You did. Mechanic is a good job. You mend stuff... Yes, but you were so angry... You seem to have changed, pet. Are you taking drugs? We know what happens in Paris. We told her not to go there. Do you have other children? Unbelievable, you haven't told her a thing. Not really because... We only just met. Exactly. Eloïse's father dumped me before she was born. I met Jean-Marie one year later. I married him. We had no other kids. He loves Eloïse like a daughter. The only thing is, she blames me because... I said I didn't know who her father was, that it was a one-night stand and then he vanished. But, in fact, I knew. She found out, left right away and gave no news for 18 months. Right... Let's not brood over it. You left before your mum had time to explain. We realize it came as a shock, but if we said nothing for years.... Telling you wasn't our way. We didn't do therapy. Mrs Gauthier said to tell her. When you were 10, she said, "Tell her in case she asks to see him." Yes, but it was too late. Besides, I was afraid. But afraid of what? That you'd reject him and prefer the other. A guy who abandons his own baby. Now he shows off in the media. William's admired in his field. He helps young people a lot. You know he's the one behind the TV show Free Trend ? He's a jerk. Why was Eloïse born in Paris? I used my maternity leave to go and see the museums with a friend. And my little pet decided to arrive early. Always the independent one! So give us your news now. And I mean good news. I'm doing ok. There's nothing special. Everything's fine. Nothing special? You play the accordion? That's when I sing. But Eloïse doesn't like it. I do like it. I'm like a little child. Who grew up too fast. In a world that's all plastic I want to find my mum. So she'll tell me stories. About Jane and Tarzan. About princesses and kites I want sunshine in my memory I want sunshine I want sunshine I want sunshine. I want sunshine. I want sunshine. Nothing but sunshine. No one was more handsome in the acting club. He was a good actor, funny... He impressed me. I was 20. He didn't notice me at first. I was discreet. Then, one day, I did a scene from Molière in that dress I gave you. And he fell madly in love with me. I was really good in that scene. Within a fortnight, he suggested living together and getting married. Hold on. In a fortnight? Yes, in a fortnight. He swore it was true love. Suddenly deciding like that, promising it all, marriage, a baby... - Sharing it all. - A loan... Yes, sharing it all. He swore he worshipped me. Shortly after, when I got pregnant, I told Prince Charming who didn't react like a Prince Charming. He told me he felt he was being manipulated, etc. that I wanted to get pregnant, and that what mattered most to him about love was the truth. And trust? I'll never blame him for trying to realize his dream. It worked for him. And I owe him part of my little treasure. We shouldn't have yelled at you so harshly. It was normal to want to meet him. You showed him the sweater I kept? I didn't meet him. I couldn't care less about meeting him. He didn't want to? Or he kept putting it off? He always put things off. What matters is you, sweetheart, not him. Still working on your suburban wine project? All the wine you made us buy when we don't drink! It wasn't a bad idea. With your business school diploma. How's your love life? Is it Sonia? Is that what you wanted to tell us? You know, it doesn't shock me. You can try ART. No! I'll stick to white. - Yeah? - It's good. It's good, it really is. Making your own wine takes nerve. Especially in the Paris suburbs. Eloïse told us there are vineyards in Montmartre, St Germain-en-Laye... - Right? - I think so. I love the idea. What bothers you, Jean-Marie, is that if she succeeds, she'll move away for good. You'll just have to get used to it. I won't be gone long and you can come to visit. This one's good. This one's too strong, a taste of dried fruit... It lacks polish, I feel. All right, it's my round! So, actually, I'm drawn to Fred to screw up the way my mum did. That's why you can't help it. I wanted his gang to accept me to get symbolically closer to my father and disown my parents for hiding him. Loads of people share ideas, even not knowing their fathers. People are put in boxes and are parted cos they aren't linked. And the fascists get ready to lay waste to those boxes, so to speak. Right... I love it when you talk. You know I could die for you? You've had a lot to drink. That's true too, but... You saved my life. You were there, like. You were an interesting case. I've bought an accordion. I played concerts when I was a girl. So Julien got out his double bass. - No. - Yes. And we fucked again. - No way! - We did. I don't see the connection, but... Yes, cos it's kind of... The box thing... What did you tell Fred? That I couldn't wait to see him, that I hadn't told my parents yet. How did he take it? Silently. Your Moby Dick guy is right. Looking at the ceiling is good. It's relaxing. Heard from him? I texted him, but he didn't answer. He's no masochist. He's a decent guy. To think that William jerk let me languish on my bench until I blew a fuse... It makes me want to... I want to... Stop, Eloïse. What are you doing? Stop, it's really late! No, stop messing about. It's William, leave a message. William's voicemail, hello. I'm your daughter, Eloïse. I wanted to tell you you're just a... a no-show with huge no-show balls. A chicken's ass! With a big carrot up your butt! That's about it... You're nothing but an asshole. So goodbye for good. Goodbye, asshole! There, that page is turned. Oh, wow! It's good. It's him. Shit, it's him. We had to leave our phones. The visit lasted five hours. I left you a message after. You never called back. Hi. Hi. I'll buy you lunch. Glad to meet you. You look like me too. That's crazy. So we meet, a few months after you got in touch. It's been 18 months. That long? It's not a pose, I don't have time. My days are full of meaning. Is your life a blast? I work at Gibert. Ok, that's good. Any prospects of promotion? I'm not sure I want to stay in that field, but... Sorry, I really don't want to talk to you. I came to be polite, but... I really don't care about you. Sorry. Hold on, I come across as an asshole. In fact I am one, but I'm more than that. Give the smarter, more sensitive guy time to emerge. I don't let him out much, so it takes a while. I find it hard to believe there's a smarter one. Forgive me. Wait! I'm from Montauban too. - Save it. - Let me explain... Excuse me... Excuse me, William, can I get a photo with you? Of course, a quick one. - I'm a huge fan. - Hurry. Thanks. For my site. I'm a guy who abandoned his daughter, so our reunion can't be simple. But I'd like to know you. What'd be your dream job? I'd like to create a wine. That's my dream. Not too far from Paris. I'd like to create a suburban wine, so to speak. Bad idea. You've been told what I do for a living? I'm paid a fortune for my intuition. For wine, choose Bordeaux or Burgundy. Once you're set up, invent a striking brand. Work on visuals. Give your wine a sound, solid base. A guaranteed hit. Room for women too. I can help you. No thanks. I want to do a suburban wine. I'll try. I'll work it out. You're an Indian! That's it, you're an Indian! There's a painter, I forget his name, who says there are two kinds of people in life. Indians and classical people. I do my best to be an Indian, but I'm classical. But your idea is really an Indian's idea. Go ahead, make your suburban wine. I can't help you, but do it. So, it isn't credible? - It is. - It's credible. I don't understand. It isn't what you wanted? We don't know each other, Fred. Sorry, but who chased me for months? Who stripped? It was me, but... I just wanted to hook you. I didn't want to live with you. To live together, it takes a lot more time. We need to check the depth of our feelings. Let's take our time. I'm not a guy who takes his time. That pisses me off. It's humiliating. Come on, I was humiliated too, right? Yes. But it's different. I'm a complete oaf deep down. But you... You want your life back? Yeah. You could say that. I know you feel we're not made for each other. I know you feel I'm right. Ok then, we split up. - But keep each other. - Totally. Totally. Moby Dick, it's Eloïse. I upset you. Can you call me, please? It's Eloïse, can you call me? Ok, it was Eloïse again. Moby Dick! Moby Dick! Moby Dick! Moby Dick! Moby Dick! - Eloïse? - Yeah. What's going on? I tried calling you, but... You're not settling down anymore? All right... Come on in. No, wait... Wait! What? I'm scared. I'm scared too, you know. I'm scared of climbing down alone. Yes, of course. Yeah... I... I really want to join you, but... It's going to be tricky. I'd have liked to kiss you all the same, just to see. Me too, but... Can you call the fire brigade? My battery's flat. Absolutely. Let's do that. Then the rest... will follow. Or not. No, I'm kidding. Hello... Yes, good evening. I'm calling you because I have a friend who is stuck up a tree. Place Goudeau. In the 18th district. Yes, fairly high up. I don't know. They're asking how you got up there. On a trashcan. "We should all lose our memory once in our lifetime..."
