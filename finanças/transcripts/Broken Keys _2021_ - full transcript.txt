In 2014, an extremist group seized control of vast areas in Iraq and Syria, imposing their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia Law. BROKEN KEYS Inspired by true events Write this: The King was waiting... The situation is critical. We're low on food and water. You might die... Leaving by sea is very risky. I know. 1,800. - I was told it was 1,300. - I was told many things too. - How about 1,500? - This isn't negotiable. And you need to pay upfront. I'll think about it. We leave in 13 days. First Turkey, then Greece. Adnan! Hey! - I'm sorry. - You're alone? My husband's missing. Why are you shouting? Who's winning? Same as usual. Right. Here. That'll do, thanks. I'm impressed. You smoke too much. Are you worried or is it because I'm your cousin? Both. TOEFL? This madness could end one day. I want to apply somewhere and study law. You think I'm a fool? No. Optimism is good. I'm not optimistic. I'd just rather not rot here forever. Any news? I found this guy named Akram. He said he can get me out. Vienna? There's an opening with an orchestra. I hope you make it. You really deserve to be heard. Make room, everyone. He needs space to work. - How can we help? - I'm good for now. Make some room! Play something. - It's too early for that. - It'll distract him. They're here! Ziad, I have to hide. Just stay here, ok? Whose is this? No one's! We found it here. You again... Have you been playing? Have you been playing? No one's been playing. We use it as a table. Then you have no use for it. Where's my father? I don't know. When is he coming back? We found more. - How many? - Three. So, there's 17 of us now. It's not enough. Especially since Riad's been taken. I'm sorry about your piano. No, you're not. Look, I want you with us. You need to come back. I'm done fighting. We need more men. What for? The revolution is dead. That's not true. If it's not dead, it's hijacked. The fighters were either killed... Captured or ran away. I know. They killed many of us and took Ziad's dad. Even your father fought. You're just gonna sit here? You fight your war, just leave me out of it. I can't help you. Coward. Everyone made fun of me when I added tape. But now, we're the only ones with a window. We need to brighten this place up. Let's repaint the front. I'm sorry about what happened. But you know, your piano lasted so long. I mean, look around you. Everything is falling apart. My shop is the exception. I'm making money. Everyone bets against me. Good for you. We're still alive. That's what matters. This is not a life. It's time to forget about this dream of yours. Europe's overrated. The things I hear... It's not so great for refugees. What do you think? I don't see the point. It's going to get dirty again. My father owned this shop. He took great care of it. I'll do the same. Check this out! - I can get you wood and stuff. - I'm not interested. - I can help you. - I don't want to fix it. Why not? They'll cut my head off. Maya said you want to leave but you're broke and only your piano is valuable. What's your point? Don't play it, fix it. Why do you care? I need money. Sell it and give me a cut. Ziad, the inside of the piano is destroyed. It's more than broken keys. I used to find things for Issa. - No thanks. - Let me try... I'm not leaving anymore! Just forget about it, ok? What? I didn't say anything. Ten. Twenty. - It's worth a lot more. - 20. Take it or leave it. My husband's dead. I have children to feed. Twenty. Go. Next! You bought all these? I buy what people sell. A piano? - Is it in good shape? - Great. I do all the maintenance. I'll give you 500. - It's worth 7,000. - That's my offer. 500. - Seriously? - It's big. - I'll need a truck for it. - Be fair. I'll decide when I see it. Go. Next! I think you should stop. You'll cause us problems. Are you scared? Maybe you're the one who should be scared. What are these? Stuff I need. I made drawings. What will you pay for each item? - Who are they? - My friends. Do you need them? Yes. They can find anything. You told me you could find anything. You want to repair it or not? - You want stuff from the shop? - 2 packs of cigarettes. Ok. But only after you get everything! You're drinking now? A bomb might drop on us at any moment. How uplifting. You shouldn't take advantage of the kid. I'm not. You're using him to get what you want. I'm going to pay him. The kid doesn't need money. He needs protection. He might become an orphan. What should I do? Adopt him? They still work. - How have you been? - I'm alive. - What happened to you? - I fell. This place has really changed. Everything has changed. Follow me. This is it. It's a different brand. But maybe I can use some parts. I don't use it anymore, and it's of little value. You know... Your mother was my best student. Even after she finished her lessons, she would still visit every week. What happened to her piano? Do you still play? Over there. How do we get there? - They saw us. It worked! - Run! Still alive? You're still upset? No. What's that? Stuff for the shop. Open it. For the shop? We're renovating it. Stay and watch. It's going to be a great show. You want to cut your hair and drink like Westerners do. You want to look like them. People in the West hate us. They want to steal our land, our goods. They want to keep us away from Islam and from Allah's will. Allah Akbar. How is Abou Moussa? Good. He helped us after my father was killed. If it weren't for him, I would've broken your fingers. How is this helping? You wouldn't understand. You think you can win? Every bomb that falls upon us is a victory. You want chaos. We may lose some battles, but we won't lose the war. More people are joining our cause. We can strike anywhere. What's wrong? It's Ziad. He should be back by now. It's fine. They go out every day. That's the problem. Better than staying here all day. You know what happens if they see you? - They can't from here. - Someone could tell on you. Like a spy? Did you color your hair? How's studying? The speaking part is hard. I have to pass to get a scholarship and a visa. And the test is pricey, so I can't fail. I feel like I'm convincing myself I can do it just so I have something to do. Me too. Maybe we can practice speaking together. I would love to. Selling cigarettes will get me a new phone. What about you? I'm gonna buy a gun. What for? To kill Abdallah and free my dad. Are you crazy? He has an army. You won't make it. A bomb would be better. Where did you find this? - At a shop. - Well done! We fooled them, they didn't see us. - Where did you go? - Issa's shop. Are you crazy? - They shot at us but missed. - We were fast. Don't go back there. You hear me? What's that? An apple. In English? And this? And this? And this? - A cow. - In English? Write it. He's been at it for two days. He can't fix it. Just play. I'm not sure I can do it. - It's too complicated. - I can get you more tools. I'm not missing tools. I need the same exact parts and there aren't any around. I'll pay you 15. It won't be enough. What for? Look what I've found! Where is this? Rami knows. I got this from his house. It's the same brand. Majd, play elsewhere. I can try to find more pictures. It's fine. It's my uncle Joseph's piano. He owned the only music store in town. - Where? - Ramza. I know. Is he still there? He should be. I can give you directions but you shouldn't go. Are you out of your mind? It's one of the most dangerous places in the country. - I must fix that piano. - What about Akram? He leaves in 8 days. You won't make it. Even so. You know, Karim, you've always been a naive fool. Your parents are dead, your house is gone, and you're going after a piano. Why don't you do something else? Like what? Look around you. They're making us live like animals. I don't know. It was supposed to be here at 9. Maybe it got delayed. - Something must've happened. - There's no way to know. Hey! Wait! You crazy? Move! - Are you going to Ramza? - Get lost! I'll pay you. How much? - How about a sandwich and snacks? - Are you serious? Look, I've only got 30. It's all I've got. Get in. Get out. Who are you fighting with? Hamza! Get out. Now. Get out. Now what? - You have ID? - Yes. Who's that? He works with me. Get out. Your shirt. Muslim? The noon prayer. - How many prostrations? - Four. Move. Come on. There you go. I'll pay the rest in 3 days. $30 now and the rest in 3 days. Or stay here. - Peace. - Peace be with you. I'm looking for the Daoud neighborhood. It's a bit further. But the roads are blocked. Don't go there. My turn! Go help Ziad. We need money. - Firas... - What? Hello, there! What are you doing here? Nothing. You want it? No. You can take it. Take it! Where is Karim? He left. Where to? Ramza. When is he coming back? He didn't say. You should go to school. You'll learn how to use it. Hello. Don't be afraid. Are you from here? I'm just lost... Never mind. I'll ask around. I should go now. Stop! Who are you? Answer me. No one, really. Are you following me? No. I'm lost. - Why are you here? - I'm looking for Joseph. Why? Move. Faster! - What side you on? - Neither. - Don't lie! - I'm not. - Where are you from? - Sekka. How did you get here? - Someone got me in. - Who? Just some guy. Why? Who is the guy with? - No idea. - Where is he now? Wish I knew. I'm meeting him in 3 days. He said he'd get you out of here? Yes. What's happening? The army is bombing everyone. Even civilians... I know about your group. Women fighting extremists. - You're quite popular. - Shut up. - Alright. - You can't leave yet. They'll hear you shoot. - Where is this Joseph? - The Daoud neighborhood. Good luck. I know, I won't make it. Unless you know your way around. Clearly, you don't. What do you want? I need a man to get out of here. It's hard for a woman on her own. Get me out and I'll take you to Joseph. Take your meds. I don't want them anymore. They make me sick. Take them. How are you? Bored. I feel useless. How's your work? I changed. For something better. May God help you. Karim came to see me a couple of days ago. What did he want? He needed help with his piano. He's a nice boy. Are you still in touch? Not really. I liked his mother a lot. I've been here before. We're not far. This way... I think. You think? Your map's bad and outdated. This place changes daily. There should be buildings here. Aboud, get back in the car. Let's go. It should be here. You sure? Doesn't look like anyone's home. Who are you? We mean no harm. It doesn't look like it. We're looking for a man named Joseph. Rami Daoud sent me. I need piano parts. Call her off. It's ok. Follow me. Are all these yours? Most. The rest I found while scavenging. I haven't seen Rami in years. Is he ok? Yes. Light! He mentioned you have a music store? I did. It's been destroyed. Is there anything left? If there is, it's buried under rubble. You'll have to check. What about this? That was mine. I sold it to a client near my store. I don't know if it's still intact, you can check. Can we stay here tonight? Follow me. The situation is getting worse. The army isn't letting anyone in. They're using rebels and extremists as an excuse. Can you trust your driver? - I think so. - You got lucky. There aren't many people getting in and out. Thank you for letting us stay. Most would've turned us away. At this point, I just want to show the children that kindness still exists. - How old are they? - I don't know. They're not mine. They were hiding and starved. I brought them here and... I've been looking for their parents ever since. I don't want salad! The building is here. This route is the safest. But the terrain is rough. Never been there. Bring the burqa. It belonged to my wife. It'll help. Thank you. This is a suicide mission. No one is forcing you to come. You're risking your life for a piano! It's my only choice. - When is your smuggler leaving? - In a week. Are you afraid? I fear being trapped here and wasting my life doing nothing. Are you going alone? - Yes. - What about your family? My parents are dead. We had no food, water, meds. Many got sick. My mom didn't make it and my dad went looking for food and never came back. Do you have anyone left? There must be people you care about... You have to leave now. Now! Hurry! - What will you do? - Just go! Where is she? You're protecting her? I don't know her. They came last night and needed a place to stay. It's the truth. Dad! I'm all they've got. Please, I'm all they've got. Put it on. We must get rid of every false thing you have been taught. Starting with your history books. And now, I want everyone to toss their book in front of the chalkboard. Hurry up! Now, I need a volunteer. You! Come. Hurry up. Hey... Slow down. You must keep up. What's your problem? My problem? Those men are after you! Why didn't you say you're on the run? - I didn't know... - He took us in. He fed us, gave us a roof. Now he might be dead because of you! I didn't know we were being followed. Obviously not. When you fight, you have enemies. I doubt you'd understand. Boys, we already spoke about guns. Now, I want to show you how to use a bomb since it can be much more effective than other weapons in certain circumstances. Stop! On your knees! On your knees! I hope you know how to use it. It should be here. Something's not right. Why do you want to leave? We have to regroup and plan our next move. Why? We were attacked a week ago. Many died and some were captured. And... women were being used as sex slaves. We're in the wrong building. Look at the sign here. There are buildings on each side, but not where we entered. Maybe the buildings were destroyed. We'll have to check. It's too dark. Let's wait until morning. I can't. My smuggler leaves in two days. I found something to drink. Get some sleep. I'll keep watch. His wife. Thank you. - It's not that bad. - You wear it. You're sure about this? You know your friends could be dead. It's not just them, I want to have a say in all that's happening. You should join. Join who? Rebels and mercenaries fighting each other? A government killing its own people? The extremists? You could come with us. Do you accept men? I mean it. Listen, I... Be careful, ok? The extremists believe being killed by a woman denies them entrance to paradise. That gives us a small advantage. You stupid fool! I thought I'd never see you again. What do you think? I ran out of blue paint but I managed. Not bad. I'm reopening soon and you're invited. How's Ziad? Ziad! Are you ok? What's wrong? Nothing. Where are you going? I have homework to do. You can't go back there. I got the missing parts! What's wrong? What's wrong? What's in the bag? Leave me alone! Give it back! - What did you do? - Give it back. It's mine. This won't solve any of your problems. How would you know? You're too scared to fight. - Trust me. - I want him dead. Stop that! You know what they'll do to you? Why do you care? You're just worried about leaving. I'll help you. I promise. They'll come for you. You must hide from now on. Come on. Where's your friend? I don't know. Again. - Moonif won't buy it. - He will. Great. How'd you do that? The improvisation? There's not a specific method. You just try to express what you feel through music. Fear, frustration, anger, hope... It's still dangerous. I know. Is that what I think it is? This will give us a big advantage. A kid stole a bomb. He's with Karim. I think they're up to something. Find him and bring him here. And watch Karim. We can't risk a rebellion. Welcome! Congratulations! You're serving tea? Drink. What's in it? Can I have some? Come... Unbelievable... He's always been optimistic, despite everything. I wonder how he does it. He always says that life without hope is suffocation. Or maybe it's just the alcohol. Tomorrow's the big day. Are you excited? It's not that simple... My mother saved for years to get it... And now I'm selling the only thing left of hers. Darkness... Darkness won't prevail. We will keep going. It's planned. Inside, inside! That's the one from the picture? Yes. Something changed? Not really... It looks new, but... it isn't. Everything works? I'll give you 900. 1,400. No. Fine. I'll only take a good offer. Good luck then. You too. Does anyone else want to buy it? Maybe. - I'll think about it. - I'm leaving in two days. It's now or never. 1,200. And I'm giving you a great deal. I might not make any profit. Fine. I'll pick it up tomorrow. Stop it! Why? Stop it! - Why? - Stop! Easy... - What's your problem? - Relax. You are the problem! You're putting us all in danger. Is that how you all feel? Bassam means it's not safe to have a piano right now. What do you suggest? - We stay here and do nothing? - There is plenty to do. We need food, water... - And music is starving us? - Music is banned! Did you forget that? We can't afford another visit. Karim can play somewhere else. I don't agree. Everyone calm down! If you want to be free, go fight on the streets. - Music won't help you. - I say fuck them. People should be free. That's the point of this place. It's just too dangerous. - Let's lie low. - Until when? - Until it's over. - And when is that? And if we can't live the way we want to, then what are we fighting for? Freedom has a price that you have to pay. Why are you being a coward? They're defying us. They're playing music and doing God knows what. I saw hookahs, cigarettes, alcohol... Karim fixed the piano. We'll visit them tomorrow, once the men are back. In the meantime, find Karim and bring him here. I'll make an example of him. - How much? - Three. - Abou Moussa! - Too expensive. We need to talk. Does Karim still work for you? Yes, why? They're looking for him. Stay inside. What's wrong? They're onto you! And the boy too. We have to warn him. - When does Akram leave? - Tomorrow. - Is the piano ready? - Except for the lid. We have to transport it tonight. Always keep it on. They have eyes everywhere. Why are you dressed like a woman? You can't play. Why not? They could hear us. - I don't care. - Drop the act. We're both wanted now. I might leave tomorrow. What about my dad? It's complicated. There isn't much we can do. I'll give you money. And do what with it? I can't go anywhere and it's all your fault! I seek refuge in Allah from the cursed Satan. In the name of God, the Merciful. And we made known to him this decree that the wrongdoers were to be utterly cut off in the morning. Nothing's worse than what this man did. He laid with another man! His sins are grave. He has insulted our religion, our laws and will be punished. Praise! God is great! - Praise! - God is great! - The Islamic State... - will endure. It's ok. It was only a matter of time. It can be fixed. We'll get some help. What are you doing? I don't care at this point. And you? You don't look ok. It's Ziad. He didn't take it well. The kid needs hope. We all do. You can't take that away from him. Majd. It's me. Where is Ziad? Where is he? He was just here. You have to hide. In the closet. Hurry! - Stay here. - Why? Whatever happens, don't move. Understood? Where is he? There's no need for all of this. This is not who you are. I know it. What about the piano? Leave it. We'll be around, when he plays. Burn everything else. It's ok. Do something! The best thing I did was rebuild my shop. I left something with the boy... so that you can go together. Don't lose hope. Even if we strike here, we'll still be outnumbered. We can't afford another defeat. - What do you want? - To help. You finally want to fight. I have an idea. I can lure them here. This is for one person. I'm not going. I'm not going alone. You have to. Akram is the best, he's never lost anyone. - I asked someone to take care of you. - I must find my dad! We'll try, I promise. First, we have to win. I don't want to. Ziad, listen. Where you're going is much safer. You'll have a normal life. I'll join you as soon as I can. Move! You don't have to do this. Next time, I'll give you a discount. We'll leave together. Hopefully, soon. Kurdish troops are near and gaining ground. We can't fight on two fronts. They're provoking you. Kill them first. Trap! It's a trap! Subtitling TITRAFILM
