In the 80s Ceausescu introduced the rationalization system. The heat, electricity and gas supply were interrupted on a daily basis. The severe lack of basic goods forces the Romanians to fight for survival. Secret Police becomes one of the most brutal control machines in the world and is responsible for the arbitrary arrest, torture and death of thousands. Half a million people are employees or collaborators of the Secret Police. Bucharest, the Socialist Republic of Romania, winter of 1988 - Has anyone seen you? - No. Close the door. Father... Good day, madam. Put it over there. Dad, turn the radio on! - This is Radio Free Europe... - Oh my! Such a thing will happen when pigs fly. But don't laugh it off just yet. Modern genetics has made great progress. Soon enough we might come across... Thank God! ...pigs that can actually fly. But even if it should come to that, we will not return to the old times. Capitalism is gone from Romania forever. The people is the true owner of everything. And it will always maintain its freedoms. Viorica, Andrei, I didn't bring anything. My husband gave the doctor our last packet of Kent cigarettes. Please. - Can you hold it? - Thank you. Say hello to Relu for me. Goodbye! Andrei, more and more people are coming. It's becoming dangerous. What do you want us to do, Viorica? We need to make a living. Didn't you see them? Be careful. Don't get caught! Me? Never! Mommy, I want banana and chocolate cake for my birthday. - Banana and chocolate cake? - Yes! We'll see about that. Go on, eat your food! Are they selling pork at the grocery store? Yes. - Oh really? - They are! If I say they aren't, will you stop eating? Seriously. I happened to be in front of the cue line. I was lucky. There wasn't enough meat for everyone, as usual. A classmate of mine said he had chocolate and banana cake. Did he? I do not know if I can find chocolate and banana cake, but I'll make you a great cream cake. I don't want cream cake! We'll see. Can't your Party comrades help you? Andrei! It's your daughter's birthday! We'll find a way to get that cake for the girl. Chocolate and banana cake? How silly! There's no banana and chocolate cake in this country. Let's close this subject! Olga, enjoy your food! Finish what's on your plate. There was a special dedication today on "Radio Free Europe". The announcer said, "From Petrus for his family." That couldn't have been our uncle. It's been so many years! I don't even want to know what he felt like when he had to leave his family behind. Instead of feeling sorry for all the bastards who flee the country, you'd better worry about your family and your dad listening to Radio Free Europe. - Mind your language! - It's the truth! What's the matter, Cristian? If dad didn't listen to Radio Free Europe, then how would you fill in your report each month? - Wanna say something to me?! - No, what could I possibly say? - I'm asking you! - No, what would I say? - Say it to my face! - Stop it! Your brother started. Here! Have something to drink, you'll feel better! Calm down you two! Gabi! Thanks. - I know, you owe me. - I owe you. Give me some! Sorry, small ration this week. - Fill it up! - Sure will! And the apartment building? Gina. I love you. Could you please repeat the name of the street? - Cheers! - Take care, Andrei! - Hi, there! - Right on time, comrade Marcu. As usual. Let's do this fast, I'm in a hurry! - Any problems? - No. Next week I can get you a nice chunk of lamb, if you're interested. I'm interested in a banana and chocolate cake. Banana and chocolate... These things are for the foreign markets. - Do you want some dollars? - How much? - 18 lei for a dollar. - 15 is the best I can do. Don't tell anyone I paid 15 lei for a dollar. How long have we known each other, Marcu? You must have the most expensive sock drawer in the country. What will you do with all that money? - I want to buy an ARO. - An ARO? You can't even get a chocolate cake and you want an ARO... Long live the motherland! You'd better get an ARO too, it would be easier to climb in! I've thought about that... 151, please respond? 151, please respond? 151, go ahead. You have to pick up a client from Intercontinental Hotel. - He specifically asked for you! - Okay, I'm on my way. - Taxicab 151? - Yes. Are you Andrei Florescu? Vasile Florescu's son? Look, I don't want any problems. My father paid for what he did, I'm just doing my job... I have a message from Petrus Florescu for Vasile Florescu. Is Petrus alive? Did he manage to leave the country? I cannot give you more information now. Come to this address! If you don't come to this address tomorrow, we won't contact you again. Hello, comrade Tudose! Hello! How are you? What can I say? I thank God that I am still alive and able to move. Have you seen Viorica? Down the hall, there are several sewing machines. You'll find her there. You sure look like hell with this overall on. Traian told me I wasn't allowed here without one. What's up? You're upset. We're supposed to have an audit. We might get an order for comrade Ceausescu himself. Oh joy, more work! You should see comrade Cristian walking back and forth... Proud and swaggering like a rooster! Be careful! Comrade Cristian is the one who keeps us on good terms with the Party. Bye. Vasile, we have a bone to pick with you! You were gone for 3 days. Where were you? Hurry up! We'll talk afterwards! Viorica! What are you doing here? I came to get you. The most incredible thing happened! What? Not here. We need to go home. So the three of us, you, me and dad, can be together. Wait a sec! Tatiana, will you clock out for me, please? Let's go! - So that's really his. - Yes, it is. Our godfather gave one to each of us. He made it! He's free. He made it! What did that man say? Tell me his exact words. Dad, I've already told you three times! He said, "I have a message from Petrus Florescu for Vasile Florescu". That was all. And that he wanted to give you the message in person. - Tomorrow at noon. - Yes. I hope you're not planning to go there, are you? Andrei, stop feeding such nonsense to father! You're not going anywhere! How do we know it's really a message from Petrus? What if it's a trap? What are you not telling us? Nothing, that's all. Wait, wait a minute! - What if he needs something? - Oh come on, dad! What if he's lying somewhere, feeling ill and all alone in the world... He wouldn't have sent us the message unless he had a problem. I'm pretty sure it's not a trap. Besides, we haven't done anything bad. God forbid! Don't you realize that we could all go to jail for that? Dad, think about little Olga! She could end up in an orphanage. Viorica... Have you forgotten all those years of hard labor? Have you? Hello, mommy. Hello, grandpa! - Honey! - Hey, dearest! Won't you say hello to your uncle? Come here! - Hi! - Hello! Hello, family! What is this? What's up, Viorica? Why did you leave work early? Tatiana said you had some family issues, but Florica told me that she saw you leave with your brother... - Olguta, go do your homework! - 10 more minutes, please! - Homework, I said! - In a moment! - And now it's my turn. - Okay, go ahead, blow! Well done, Olguta! Run along now! Enough with the bubbles! Family problems... If I remember correctly, when the Party gave me this apartment, they said it was for Cristian Ilie and his family. Why wasn't I invited? Am I no longer part of the family? Come on, Cristian. I haven't been feeling well, that's all. And I asked Andrei to take me home in his cab. So you haven't been feeling well. So you called Andrei... Good thing you called Andrei. Olguta! Good night! Good night! What are you doing here? - Dad, it's an unnecessary risk. - Very well! Who knows who these people are and what they want? There's no point in going, you'd better stay home. Okay, we'll go together! If I see something I don't like or if I think something is wrong, we go home straight away. You sure are stubborn! And so are you. Who do you think you got that from, boy? Let's go! Welcome to the American Embassy! Wait for me here. The Ambassador of the USA will be with you in 5 minutes. Can I offer you anything? Coffee? A refreshment? Coffee? Do you have real coffee? Yes. Do you also have real Coca-Cola? Hello! Allow me to introduce you to the Ambassador of the USA. Mr. Roger Kirk. Andrei. This is my father. - Be seated. - Sit down, Dad! Please, proceed! We regret to inform you that Mr. Petrus Florescu passed away a month ago of natural causes. He was 72. He died on the island of Oahu, in the State of Hawaii. Mr. Smith is the executor of Mr. Florescu's last will and testament. Testament? Yes! In his will, Mr. Florescu left "Freedom", his farm, which consists of 1,235 hectares of farmland. Mostly used for the cultivation of pineapple and coffee. Here are some photos. - Is that Petrus? - Yes, that's him. The assets are worth 3 million US dollars. So Petrus made it. - Is Hawaii nice? - It is very beautiful. Was he happy there? I can assure you that he was very happy, Mr. Florescu. He arrived in Hawaii 20 years ago and became a well-loved member of the community. He had a good life. His only regret was that he wasn't able to see his family again. He wanted to contact you, but he was afraid of causing harm to you and your family. 3 million?! And all of it is ours? According to American law, you are the legitimate heirs of this property. Should you decide to accept, before handing you papers... we will have to inform the Romanian State. So it's going to be confiscated, isn't it?! Unfortunately for you and for us, you are right. As you know, neighboring countries such as Hungary and Yugoslavia, have laws which are... more lax in terms of private property. In Romania, however... In Romania there is no such thing as private property! Exactly! So what can we do? You must understand the US has no wish to see this property passed into the hands of communist Romania. Officially there's nothing we can do. What is he saying? Officially, there's nothing we can do. And unofficially? There is a way out. You can claim the inheritance at any American embassy, but... from another country. Any country but Romania. The decision is yours. You have 3 months. If during this time the inheritance is not claimed, it becomes the property of the USA. Here's a letter for you. That was stupid! If we hadn't gone there, you'd never know that you are a millionaire. I'm not a millionaire. And what you guys did was stupid. You'd better keep your mouths shut. At least he had a good life there. I gather that Hawaii is quite beautiful. Viorica, the next time you go to church put his name on the prayer list so we can all pray for his soul! I've already put his name down next to mom's, don't worry. How about the inheritance? Dad, it's ours! We can't just give it up! Haven't you heard that, if we claim it, the state will take it away? It's better if the Americans keep it instead of Ceausescu, that moron. Dad, stop saying that name! Don't you see how we live? How we're overjoyed when we get our hands on some pork? I'm not giving up on that inheritance! What inheritance? What you see is what we've got. And our monthly salaries. - That's an upright and healthy life! - Is it? Is it right to wait in line all day for a slice of butter... while they live like kings?! Keep your voice down, please! - Does that seem fair to you? - Life isn't fair, my boy. We have never been rich and we never will be. Petrus wanted this inheritance to be ours. - He wanted us to be happy. - And how are you going to get it? Are you going to claim it and then kindly ask the state to give it back? I'll claim it in Yugoslavia. How? Do you have a visa or a passport? I'll request a passport. I work, we have this apartment, Cristian is a respected Party member, I can get a passport, why shouldn't I? Do you hear him, dad? Andrei... We have a family and a life here. This is it! I want more. - Grandpa? - Yes? Tell me a story! Grandpa is old, he doesn't remember any stories. Please, I only want one, I promise! All right. Listen carefully! - Are you listening? - I am. Once upon a time, there lived three brothers... These brothers were hardworking and clever, but lived in a kingdom ruled by a wicked king who lived in a large palace and was very envious. When he saw that the three brothers lived so well and they were happy, he decided to steal everything from them. So he took everything. The house and land... and he turned them into his slaves. - Poor brothers! - Indeed, poor guys... And then? But the 3 brothers built for themselves... a big balloon and flew up into the sky. But while the balloon was floating in the sky, the king's armies saw them. And they started shooting arrows. Pow, pow, lots of arrows! They punctured the balloon and the brothers fell into a deep river. What happened to them? The first one... fell into the river, he sank to the bottom... and there he remained. The second one... broke his legs in the sharp rocks hiding in the water and the current took him back to the kingdom of the evil king. And the third brother? The third one? Nobody knew what happened to him. I'll find out and tell you. Good night, my sweetie! There you go. - Don't you need it? - I have already filled in the papers. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Next! - Good day. - Good day. Is everything all right? Yes, I think so. Next! You need the filled in form, the photos and 25 lei. I forgot my wallet. Could I go and get it, and pay the fee later? We close at 12, miss. Come back tomorrow morning. I can't wait until tomorrow... See? It all worked out! Thank you. Here you are. Who's next? Thank you. Comrade! - I thought you'd already left. - You've been very kind. Ioana Balan. - Andrei Florescu, nice to meet you! - Likewise. I left my wallet at work, at Dinamo Sports Club. We can go there and I'll give you back the money. It's not far. Sure. Let's take a taxi! It's free. I've never heard this song. Is it on the radio, comrade Florescu? No, it's not. "Comrade Florescu"... Call me Andrei! May I call you Ioana? Fine. I don't smoke. So you work for Dinamo. I'm a coach. - Really? What do you coach? - Swimming. I used to be a professional swimmer, but now I just coach others. Pretty awesome! Thanks for coming to my rescue today. You're welcome. If you ever feel like taking a tour of the city by cab, here's my phone number and my taxi ID. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Bye! - Bye! Call me! Codrina, tell me how you fled Romania and when you reached Canada. I fled Romania two years ago, with some friends... - Look what I've drawn, Grandpa! - Oh, you drew them really well! But you still haven't told me what happened to the third brother. Come closer. The third brother managed to escape the kingdom of the wicked king and he reached the promised land. And was he happy there? More or less. He was free, but he never saw his family again. So this story doesn't have a happy ending? One of the brothers remained in the kingdom of the evil king. He didn't have everything he wanted, but he learned that true happiness means living surrounded by your loved ones, and learning to be content with what you have, however little it may be. Comrade Florescu! Andrei! - What are you doing here? - Can help you? Are you ready? - For what? - For a coffee. I know a place where they have good coffee. The real thing. Come on, say yes! Thank you. You're welcome. Surrogate coffee. We'll have to wait a bit for the caviar, champagne and roast lamb. They placed an order in Hungary, so they'll be here in a few years. Do you like Bucharest? It's a beautiful city, isn't it? Especially in winter. Tomorrow I'm on daytime shift, so if you feel like taking a ride, my cab is at your disposal. For free. I can't tomorrow. Do you have a competition? A small race between coaches. And I'm not invited? To the competition? I want to see you in your swimsuit. Then no! - What is this? - A gift. The greatest hits from the other side of the Iron Curtain. I hope you'll like them. Isn't this illegal? No. I mean, what idiot would make Madonna illegal? Or U2? Seriously now. Thank you. You're welcome. Good day. Hello! Hello! Thank you. REQUEST FOR SURVEILLANCE PERSONAL FILE THE BALLOON CASE VASILE, PETRUS AND DANIEL SURVEILLANCE FILE NO. 1110 REGARDING THE DRIVER (SECRET NICKNAME) REQUEST... REJECTED It's okay. Carry on. Oh, Ioana! Congratulations! I've read the final report for the "Radulescu" case. An excellent investigation! We'll get all of them: him, his mother and his father. Thanks, comrade! What is this? The preliminary report concerning comrade Florescu. The guy who requested a passport to visit Yugoslavia. - Have you met him? - Yes, at the Passport Bureau. And he waited for me at the club today. But don't worry, he doesn't suspect a thing. - Anything out of the ordinary? - I have some stuff. A contraband cassette tape, a taxi ride with the meter off, I also have something about his father... Keep following this lead and see what else you can find out. Very well, comrade! And if you catch a big fish, I'll have the perfect excuse to promote you. The "Radulescu" case was a step in the right direction. Another one like this and the promotion will be yours for sure. With better salary, a bigger home... Haven't I told you that you'll get far? Well? Thank you, comrade! No, you have to say, "Yes, sir!" Are you coming tonight? I can't come today. I need to get home early. But maybe I'll find time for you tomorrow... Hello? - 500 lei, right? - Right. - Banana and chocolate. - Yes, banana and chocolate. Got it! Come by tonight at the back door! - Thanks, man! - Bye! COMRADE NICOLAE CEAUSESCU'S SPEECH Fuck you all! 151, can you hear me? 151! 151, I'm here. Someone left a message for you at the headquarters. Go ahead! Do you still want to see me in my swimsuit? On your marks! Go, Ioana! Come on, come on! Go, Ioana, go! Well done! Bravo! - Congratulations! - Thanks, but it was no big deal. I'm talking about the swimsuit. You look great in it. - Well done! - Thanks. Are these all your supporters? No one else has come to see you? There's no one else who could come. I was wondering if you're free tonight. Maybe you'd like to go to a party. A party? We're celebrating my niece's birthday. Olga is turning 8 today. We're having a family get-together and... - Oh, how nice! - Would you like to go? All right. But I'll need to bring a present, won't I? I have prepared something. We just need to make a quick stop. All right. I'll go change and I'll be right back. - I'll wait for you at the door. - Okay. - Where's the cake? - Hello! Hello! I'm sorry, man... I can't help you. They came here and asked about you. Who has? Try "Chrysanthemum" cake shop. They have good chefs there. - Come on, Mihai! - Don't get me in trouble, man! And don't come around here again! Is everything all right? No, we'll just have to make another quick stop. Excuse me, does Olguta live here? I've heard it's her birthday. Uncle Andrei! - Happy birthday, little one! - I'm not a little one, you are! - Me? - Yes, you! - You heard correctly! - This is Ioana... - And she's Olguta. - Happy birthday, Olga! Are you my uncle's girlfriend? Go on, go back to the children! - Look! - Wow, it's so fluffy! - Welcome! - Ioana, this is my sister, Viorica. - Pleased to meet you! - Mrs. Tudose... He's my dad! - Mr. Tudose. - Cristian, delighted to meet you! Relu, Tatiana... This is Ioana. Won't you sit at the table? Come have a seat! Thanks, Mrs. Tudose. Do sit down! - Would you like a glass of wine? - Thanks, but I don't drink. - Maybe a soda? - Yes, I'll have a soda. Just a moment. So, tell me, comrade Ioana... Have you known each other long? Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday... Our dearest Olga... Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday, Olga! Happy Birthday, my dear! But you said I could have banana and chocolate cake... I know, Olguta, but this is a special cake. This is a cake with whipped cream, and also... oranges and sour cherries. It's so good. You'll love it! I know. I'm sorry, Olguta. I promise that next year you'll get a great big cake with bananas and chocolate. Not one, but two cakes! Come on, blow the candles! You'll like this one, you'll see! Happy birthday! Olguta, you'll have your chocolate cake next year. Two cakes, huh? You shouldn't have promised if you knew you couldn't keep that promise. I had no choice. They're after me because of the passport. She talked about it all day. It's all she thought about. So what do you want me to do? Appear before the Party and demand a banana and chocolate cake? - The Party isn't the problem! - Enough already! You and your father have negative influence on my daughter. - Sit down! - Sit down, huh?! Trashy people like you are a cancer for this country! You're destroying everything we've built. Why the hell we have so many prisons when we might just shoot you, punks! - What did you say? - Shoot you all, I said! - Go on, hit me if you dare! - Andrei, there are children here! Let him be, he's drunk. - That's you brother! - At least he tried! Come on, light the candles, we need some light in here! You, capitalist! This one has sour cherries. I'm sorry you had to witness that. I screwed up little Olga's birthday. Cristian might be a jackass... but he's the jackass my sister chose. So there's nothing I can do. That's the problem with family, you can't choose who's in it... Eat it, it's very tasty! I had a family, you know? I wasn't always an orphan. My mother died in childbirth, but my father raised me. He was a militia officer. I remember when I turned nine... he bought me a pair of skates. I was so happy! I had never skated before. He promised to come home at 5 o'clock and we'd go to the lake together. So I waited for him. But he never showed up... They came by later to tell me he had died in the line of duty. He was a good man... He really believed in what he was doing. Hooray, long live the Party! I think I should go home... I'll drive you there. No, no. I'll go by myself. Stay with your family. Thanks, Andrei! - Comrade Balan. - Hello, comrade! Have you made any progress? I have continued the investigation according to procedure. Subject Florescu seems to be in order. He has committed some small irregularities, but otherwise he's fine. Nothing suggests that he wishes to flee the country. He also has a healthy family environment. He has a brother-in-law who is devoted to his work at the textile factory. Very well. My sources say the contrary. Apparently he doesn't exactly have healthy social origins. Vasile, Daniel and Petrus Florescu tried to flee the country on March 3, 1969. They built a hot air balloon and they tried to fly over the Danube. They were located and the balloon was shot down. Daniel Florescu and Petrus Florescu disappeared into the Danube, and Daniel's corpse was located a few days later. Petrus's corpse was never found. Vasile, the father... was arrested and he spent several months in prison. Since then, all the family members have behaved themselves. But you never know with people like them. - Continue the investigation! - Yes, sir! Ioana! I came by your place last night... but you weren't home. I was assessing the suspect's situation, personally. I got home late. - But you didn't report that. - I reported this morning. - I hope I didn't cause any problems. - No, none whatsoever. I'll take care of everything. As usual. Not now, Scarlat! Scarlat, what are you doing? Let go of me! Never forget that you are who you are thanks to me! Do you hear me? You never say no to me, do you understand? Do you understand? Never! Hello! - On time as usual, comrade Marcu. - Naturally. - Say, where are we going? - At your place. We're investigating citizens who asked for passports. Guess who asked to handle your case? Who? Stop that! - But I want to go to school! - We have to wait a bit. But I'll be late. This is "Radio Free Europe". Leave that aside! Do you have anything to declare? - Gold, money, cigarettes, coffee? - No, we don't. I don't think we need to perform a detailed inspection. Move aside, Olguta! - Is that all? - Yes. Madam, will you make some coffee while I fill in the form? How are you? Andrei, you can't just show up anytime and anywhere you like! Is everything okay? Forgive me, I had a bad day. That's all right, I've got the perfect remedy for that. - Maybe another time. - Don't you feel like going out? I know a nice place, it's just half an hour from Bucharest. If you don't like it, I'll drive you home. Careful, it's slippery! Do you like it? I do. I hope they fit. But I can't skate, Andrei. Come on! There... There you go! Fine. Great! Hold me! I got you! You're doing fine! I'm not coming back. What? I'm not returning to Romania. - Andrei, you can't tell me that! - Don't be scared... I don't want to get you into trouble, but I'm pretty sure that I'll get my passport and I wanted to tell you. - Why me, what for? - I want you to come with me! I can't, Andrei. It's not possible... - Sure! - It's impossible! You're an athlete. First time you leave the country for a competition, I'll be there, waiting for you. - We can't leave the country! - Yes, we can! - You don't know who I am. - I want you to come with me! - It's not possible! - Sure it is. No way! I'm a millionaire. What? I have an inheritance waiting for me in Hawaii. 3 million dollars. That's why I need a passport. Hawaii, Ioana! Over there... Over there you can do anything. You can dress anyway you want. You can... eat what you want, you can say what you want. You can read whatever you want. Can you imagine how it must be like to live in a place where you don't have to be afraid of anything? Where you can do anything... Hello! Good morning! Congratulations, comrade! Congratulations, comrade Balan! No, no... Yes! Yes... All right. We'll talk later. Lieutenant Balan! Congratulations! Aren't you happy? - You promoted me? - Yes, I did. No more fieldwork for you. You can now move on to the brainy part. Interrogations, major cases. See you tonight. You have a letter. They have no reason to... It's making no sense... What did you think? I thought I could make it happen. I talked to the right people. I bribed the right people with the right amount. Who are they to tell me what I can and cannot do? They are the State. They can do whatever they want. Did you really think they would allow you to leave the country? Welcome to Romania! What's next on your list, lieutenant Balan? What about my cases? I have several ongoing investigations. Forget about them! I took care of that. I turned down Florescu's passport request. Case closed. You could have told me that! Think about your own life. You're a lieutenant now. You have the right to a larger house, in a better neighborhood, maybe a two-room apartment. Aren't you happy? We have to be careful, you and I. You're a lieutenant. From now on... everyone will be spying on you too. All right then... I need to go home, otherwise my wife will be angry again. See you at the office, comrade. What's going on? Were you asleep? No, no, forgive me! Come on in! What about your family? They're all sleeping... Tell me, what is it? Is something wrong? I'm coming with you. I'm choking here, I can't stand it anymore. My passport request was turned down. There's another way. But it's risky. Very risky. The photos. Come alone, it will look less suspicious that way. - Visa for Yugoslavia, got it? - Got it! Close the door behind you! And now what? We shouldn't be seen together before we leave. I'll pick up the passports and meet you at the train station. I have to take a day off from work. At least on Saturday. Andrei... Nobody must know. Not even your family. Go on, go on! Stop! Gabi! What is it? Can you stand in for me on Saturday? Why? What happened? - I'm going to Hawaii. - Come on, tell me! I'm busy. Oh, nice office! Not bad. Be careful with the portrait! You know what happens to you if you destroy it. You're too cute to go to prison. Comrade Scarlat, I would like to take two days off on Saturday and Sunday. I need to clean up and put some things in order. In my new home. I don't think so. You could come around and help me. Don't push it, comrade! You know I spend the weekends with my family. Your promotion is restricted to the work environment. But... if you finish with paperwork until tomorrow... You may have two days off. Without payment. - Aren't you supposed to sleep? - I'm going to. Go to sleep, it's late. Hello, a ticket to Stamora-Moravita, please. One way or round trip? - Round trip. - 220 lei. - When will you return? - Tomorrow. Sorry to bother, comrade, I think that is my seat. Sorry about that. Traveling for pleasure, comrade Florescu? - Florescu family? - Yes. Who are you looking for? Comrade, who do you wish to see? - Vasile Florescu? - Yes. Speak up! Speak up! Speak up! Leave him for now! Tell us about Ioana Balan. How come you know her? You'll end up talking sooner or later. Here everybody talks. Who is Ioana Balan? No one special. An acquaintance. Tell us about Hawaii. I hear it's a beautiful place. You're wondering how we found out. Comrade Ioana Balan told us everything. Where is she? Don't worry, lieutenant Balan is doing just fine. She mentioned an inheritance. She is beautiful, isn't she? And very meticulous. So you won't speak up, will you? You'll end up speaking. Sign the renunciation or they'll hurt your kid so bad! Thank you, comrade Florescu! The Romanian State has just won 3 million US dollars. And I earned myself a promotion. Bastards! Do you realize the mess your stupid brother has made? - Leave him alone! - Take your hands off me. He's my brother so I'll help him whether you like it or not. And never touch me like that again! I am sorry. Eat now! Excuse me, is Ioana Balan coming to the pool today? She hasn't come here in 3 or 4 months. How is Andrei? Not good. Viorica, you're not working, your brother got fired, how are you guys going to survive? We'll find a way. What about Cristian? Cristian is scared, he's afraid they'll kick him out of the Party. - How are things at the factory? - They're killing us! We're sewing flags for the "May 1st" celebration. Comrade Ioana. Andrei, let me explain. - I do not know what they told you... - Do you work for the Secret Police? I had no choice, Andrei. We all have a choice. That was your choice. I love you, Andrei. Did you sleep with him? This whole damn country is one big trap. We are like fish caught up in a fishing net. As soon as we think we're out, we just get more tangled. Nobody ever wins here. I feel like I'm suffocating. Look, my boy, I'm old and... I forget things sometimes. But I've never forgotten what it was like to be free before dreadful communism came along. I take a breath of fresh air every time something nice happens in the family. Like when you graduated from high school... Or when Olguta comes to kiss me goodnight. Yet I feel I'm suffocating, just like you. What are you willing to do? Anything. Let me show you something. Give it to me. Open it. Olguta, take your things away, let's set the table. - Where's the tablecloth? - Grandpa took them all. 131 cm... I can't believe it. Father! It's the old design. We're going to succeed this time. Viorica, we're in a hurry. We must be ready by May 1st, when all border guards will be celebrating. It's our only chance. We only have one day and two nights. We need help. - More? - Yes. Much more, we need more fabric. Here! Let's place it here! Viorica... P6... See? This is the middle part. I see. Where do we start? Good morning! Good morning! - How was it? - I'm sure they'll be satisfied. It's the best flag we've made so far. It's almost finished. Oh, my sweetie is already up. Good morning. Good morning. Last night I slept in mommy's bed. - Did you? - Yes. I didn't know when you would be back, so I let her sleep in our bed. Great. I'll take a shower, drink some coffee, take Olga to school, and then I must go back to the factory as soon as possible. Tomorrow is May 1st. Dedication from Florin in Hamburg to his family and friends in Romania. Here's another one. It's fine. But we'll never finish. We haven't even done a quarter of it. - Hi. - Thank you. Come in, honey! How was Cristian doing? He's very angry. There were some problems with the fabric color. - Hello! - Hey, Olguta! He'll not come home soon. - What are you doing here? - Shh! Quiet, Olguta! - All right, thanks. - Is something wrong? No. Viorica! - Good evening, comrade Tudose. - Good evening. Good evening! Andrei needs help. Good evening. We've come here to help. These two first and then the rest. This piece is 9 meters long. We need more fabric. We used up everything we had. There's nothing left. Andrei? What are you doing here? I need the keys to the fabric warehouse. You need what? The keys to the fabric warehouse. Have you gone mad? Get out of here, I'm busy! Haven't you all heard me? Thank you. See what you can do about Cristian. Thank you all! Hello! Comrade Ilie! They beat me and tied me up. He wants to flee the country in a balloon. They took off in a yellow ARO. Plate no. 31-B-318. They'll try to escape here. At the old harbor. Hello. What? Send a patrol! You're coming with me, I want you to see for yourself! Father! The Danube! Now we turn left. It's rising! We've made it, father! Hurry up! Come on, father! Good luck, my boy! Father! They are here, father! Run, father! It's the militia! No! Leave the steering wheel! God dammit! Ioana! Here, Ioana! - Are you all right, boss? - Yes, I am.
