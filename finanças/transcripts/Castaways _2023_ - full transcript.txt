She was right, everyone was running, everyone was sick and scared with nowhere to go. Survival instincts had kicked in and my mom was good at survival, she had to be. I, on the other hand, was not, not yet. (tense melodic music) We lost so much since everyone got sick, my dad, then my sister and now it's just me and my mom. Even my cat, Maggie's gone. (car door clicking) (car door thudding) - What were you doing in there? Oh, my God, you got us Safe Bands? - Mm-hm. - How? - You're my life, I've paid everything and more for two spots for us, I made you a promise, we're getting out of here alive. (Lila exhaling heavily) (car engine starting) (car rumbling quietly) Seatbelt. - It's on. Pedestrians, pedestrians. - [Lila] Okay, I got it. - Think we'll make it to this boat? - Oh, we will. (tense melodic music) Hold on. (tense melodic music) Okay. (car doors thudding) Go, go, go. - Which one is it? - Through here. Yep. Ah, straight ahead. - There? - Yep. - Whoa, whoa! - [Man] What the fuck? I'm not sick, man! - Hey. - Hi, we have bands. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Hey. Okay, okay. - Healthy as a horse. - What does that mean? - It means, you're special. - [Lila] Up there, come on. (soft melodic music) - [Emily] Yes, we made it onto this boat. Yes, we're part of the lucky few, but I'm starting to think maybe we should have stayed, watched the world burn, because where the hell do we go from here? - Mm. (glasses clinking) - To the first time. (laughing) - To another time. Hm! - [Walter] Just a little whiskey. - Maybe some water actually? - Hm, no, honey, you should drink your... - Whiskey. - Whiskey. - Yeah. - I'm not thirsty anymore. - Aw! - More for us. (both laughing) (soft tense music) (fingers snapping) - I'll take one. - Nice hand. - I'll say. - [Emily] Mom, we should go back to the room. - Oh honey, I'm here with, um? - Walter. - Walter, you go, I'll meet up with you. - Mom, this guy's not gonna solve your problems. - Hey, women always solve my problems. - I see, mm-hm. We need a win. - Yeah, but not like this. I'm going to bed. - Goodnight? - Oh. (Walter laughing) (soft melodic music) (wind blowing) (Cara knocking) (soft melodic music) (door clicking) - You okay? - [Emily] Yeah. - Lock your door. (soft melodic music) (door thudding) (soft melodic music) (waves crashing) - [Cara] Okay. (soft tense music) (Lila knocking) - [Lila] Honey, it's me. (knocking) Come on, open up. (door clicking) - [Emily] Hi, come in. - Oh. (tense melodic music) (door thudding) Oh, "All's well that ends well." That's from Shakespeare. - Okay, do you wanna take a shower? - No. You go, do your thing. You're gonna like them. Get ready for bed, hm? - Okay. - Yep. - At least put some pajamas on. - No. (tense melodic music) (door clicking) (Emily sighing) (door thudding) (lightning cracking) (thunder rumbling) (tense melodic music) (lightning cracking) (thunder rumbling) (Cara breathing heavily) (tense melodic music) (Cara breathing heavily) (tense melodic music) (waves lapping) (lightning cracking) (thunder rumbling) (Cara breathing heavily) (waves crashing) (boat rumbling) (dramatic melodic music) (glass shattering) - Come on, Mom, please wake up! The storm is getting really bad! (dramatic melodic music) (glass shattering) (Cara screaming) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (waves crashing) (tense melodic music) - Shit. Come on, girl. Come on, girl. (Emily coughing) - Get off of me! - "Thank you, Cara, for saving my life." "Oh, you're welcome." Jesus. - What happened? Oh, my God, where are we? - You don't remember the storm? You remember being on the ship though, right? - Yeah. - We capsized. - We what? - We capsized. - Where is everybody else? Where's my mom? - No one's here. - What do you mean no one's here? You checked everywhere? - No, but I checked most of the island. - Not all of it. - Where are you- - Mom! - I already looked down there! - [Emily] Mom! - We need to build some sort of shelter or something! - I gotta find my mom! - Fine, I'll do it myself. Jesus Christ. (waves crashing) (Emily breathing heavily) - Come on, she's gotta be somewhere else. Okay. (waves crashing) Fucking serious?

Come on. (coconut thudding) (Cara grunting) There we go. (soft orchestral music) (Cara exhaling heavily) (Emily sighing heavily) (gentle piano music) I thought you might be hungry. - Thanks. (gentle piano music) - So what's your name? It's not a trick question, you know. - Emily. - Here. (gentle piano music) I'm Cara. I saw you on the boat. Is that your mom you were with? Okay, you don't have to talk, it's fine, but I built a little shed thing over there, it's not much, but it's better than- - I'm good where I am. - You sure about that? I mean, it rains pretty often, so if I were you, I would... Well, if you change your mind, you know, it's- - I won't. - [Cara] Whatever. (gentle orchestral music) (waves crashing) (soft orchestral music) (water splashing) (soft orchestral music) (water splashing) (Cara grunting) (soft orchestral music) (water splashing) (Cara grunting) (water splashing) Oh, son of a bitch! - You're doing it wrong. - [Cara] Oh, yeah? Why don't you come out here and show me how it's done? - Okay. (waves crashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (Emily grunting) - Wow, Jesus. - Do you want this? - Who would've known that I'm shipwrecked with Captain Ahab? (water splashing) - It's not that hard. What, you wanna learn? Come on, grab it right there. - Okay. - Yeah, right on there and hold here. - Okay. - Other way, relax a little bit. So you see that fish? You're gonna go for that one, but you're gonna wait for it to come to you. Watch it, keep your eye on it and go, go, go, go! (water splashing) Hey, good one. - I did it! (laughing) - Good job. - Fucking got that sucker. Look at that. - What is that? - I don't know. (soft orchestral music) (water splashing) - Let's bring it in. - Okay. - I'm gonna pull, you push. - Right. (water splashing) - Ah! - (laughing) Look at this stuff. - Look at this. Cute! - We can have tea and crumpets. - Ah, yes. - [Cara] Set the table. - Hold on, I think I just found someone's diary. - Oh-oh. - By the looks of it. (soft orchestral music) (waves crashing) "Dear Diary, Day four on this island and I'm beginning to think we might be stuck here forever." (Cara laughing) Wait, I'm sorry, that was me. (soft orchestral music) (waves crashing) It's probably all some poor family had left. Now they might be gone too. - Hey, you can't let yourself think of it that way, it's too depressing. Oh! Cara is wearing an original design by a fabulous fashion icon, Monsieur Boxer. This new collection is called Lit Underwear and as you can see, it's a great color for all skin tones and the classic oversized style enables a whole range of movement, which makes way for much fun on pretty much any island you wash up on. - Okay. Very funny, you got me. I'm hungry. - Well, got those fish over there. You know anything about fires? - Of course, we need to get a rescue signal going anyway, so that works, make a fire, kill two birds, one stone. - Sounds good. - You wanna help me gather some twigs and stuff? - Oh, I bet these would go up in flames pretty quick, huh? - You're kidding? This is our rescue flag. - Yeah, do that.

Do you remember what things were like before? - Barely. I can't believe it's only been like two years. - [Emily] Feels like forever. - It does. All right. I got one. This one's for you. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. (waves lapping) (soft orchestral music) - Hey, come in, it feels amazing! - Rain check, I got some snacks. (soft orchestral music) Got some goodies. - Oh, my God, you got a mango? I love mangoes. Mm! Oh, my God. So I was exploring a bit this morning and I found a tidal pool full of crabs and like a bunch of other stuff you can eat, so I was thinking if I can make it some place? - Yeah, sure, yeah, that sounds good to me. - Nice touch. - I know this can't replace your family, but I figure this would make things feel a little bit more homey for you. - That's sweet. - Besides, you're probably sick of my face being the only one you ever see. - Not even a little. That's Henry and his wife Veronica of course, but you might know her as Ronnie. They were high school sweethearts and got married right after college. - Okay. - On the right is Hank Junior, he's a lot older than this now, but he's basically a good kid, you know, until he developed that nasty gambling habit, you've probably heard about it. And that's Zoe on the left, she's the smart one. - Right, she got a full ride to MIT, where she is now and she's working on a way to save the world. - And, and thank God for Zoe, 'cause I mean, after Veronica's flower episode. - You realize this is getting weird, right? - Yeah, it totally is. Um, thoughts on exploring the island? - Maybe we can stay here on our beach? - Hm, no, maybe we could go, come on. - Okay. - Come on. - All right, so why are we doing this again? - What do you mean? As guests of the island, it's important we get to know the lay of the land. - Right, 'cause the bugs here are different than the bugs by our camp. - No, I saw this movie once where these people- - Wait, wait, wait, give me a second. - We're waiting. I saw this movie once where these people were shipwrecked and they like- - Wait, wait, let me guess, they ate each other, right? - Ew, don't be gross! Why is that the first thing you think of? Come on. - All right. - We're leaving. - Oh. - They finally get around to tracking on the other side of the island and what do they find? A resort with food and massages and like a lazy river, all of it within like a mile of where they've been stranded for the last three months, I don't know. - Wait, so let me get this straight, you're saying that we're gonna find some sort of tropical resort, that's been unaffected by the last few years and it's just right over that ridge over there. - Not necessarily, but you never know. Holy! - Crap, that's... - Amazing. (soft melodic music) (waterfall gushing) - Last one in makes dinner! - What? Oh, my God, you're such a cheater. - No, I'm not. (both shrieking) (water splashing) (mellow melodic music) (mellow melodic music continues) We spent so much time in there. - We look like prunes, like little raisins. - Little raisins.

I promise, I'm gonna count to three, okay. One, two, three. (grunting) - Uh! - (breathing heavily) Okay. - What do we do now? - No, seriously, you should've seen yourself, probably scared away all the wild animals in the jungle. - Thank you, I don't know what I was thinking, I could've gotten us both killed. - Hey, but you didn't. - But I could have. What if something happens to one of us? - Then we deal with it, literally like we are right now. - No, like what if something really bad happens to one of us, what if something happens? What if something happens to you and I can't, like I can't do anything about it? - Well, in case you haven't noticed, I can take care of myself just fine. - Wait, so what, you, you really think, that we can just stay here on the island, just you and I like, like forever? - What, you think it's safer out there than it is here? - Yeah. - Because from what I saw, I mean, you had a hell of a lot more to worry about on that boat than you do here on this island. - I handled the situation on the boat fine. - It's such bullshit!

What is that? - Check it out. Washed up with the tide an hour or so that way. It's gotta be from our ship, right? - You got me canned meat? - I guess if all you've been eating is bland fish and fruit, that shit's disgusting. - It's actually really good. - Yeah. - Have you ever had it? - No, I haven't.

(Cara laughing) What? - Man, you eat more than anyone I've ever met. You have one hell of an appetite. - I do have an appetite, it's not always for food though. (waves lapping) (soft melodic music) - Hey, Em, help me fix the hut! (waves crashing) - What the hell, Cara? - "It's been so long since I was this happy." - Give it back. - "But it won't last, right, nothing good does and even if we have these stolen moments, what happens when we're rescued?

(waves crashing) (fire crackling) (gentle melodic music) - It was just, ah, it was just a few months into everybody getting sick. We were running really low on money, so my parents started getting really scared, so we joined this group. Everybody lived on like this one big compound, we grew our own food, had our own school. When we heard about all the crazy shit, that was going on in the world, I mean, we felt protected there. - Kind of sounds like it was more like a cult? - Exactly. Anyways, a couple weeks before my 15th birthday, I overheard this conversation between my parents and one of the guys in charge. They were saying that when I turned 15, I'd have to get married and start a family. He said that we needed to repopulate the Earth. - Holy shit. So what did you do? - I waited for everybody to go to sleep, I packed my shit up and then I got the hell out of there. So I played poker here and there to make money. I was just trying to make enough money to get as far away from that bullshit as possible. How about you? (fire crackling) (gentle melodic music) - Um. (sighing) My father was a doctor, so he got sick pretty early on, he was one of the first to die. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. (fire crackling) (gentle melodic music) My mom got scared, (sighing) so she moved my little sister and I up to the woods near the northern border. - You have a sister? - Had. Her name was Lucy, she would've been 14 this year. (fire crackling) (gentle melodic music) And then my mom lost it. She found a nice guy to marry and he was happy to take care of her, only he was a little too interested in me. - Son of a, I'll fucking kill him. - No, you don't have to do that, he wound up getting sick and dying. But yeah, as I'm sure you noticed, my mother was looking for a new sugar daddy on the boat. (Emily sighing) - I'm sorry. - What for? I don't think any of us were dealt a fair hand. You know, I can't even imagine you as a baby factory. That is fucked! - Mega fucked. Okay, I don't understand how to do this thing. What did I do wrong here? 'Cause clearly something's not working. - Here, you went over it twice. - Oh, so I go under there and then? - Yeah. - Okay. - You have to feed it back through there, looks good though. - Does it? - Yeah. - I don't know about that, but it serves a purpose. - What's the deal with this? - Hm? - That's cool. - My tattoo? - Yeah. - It was about a year into being on my own and I met this really cool woman, who had a tattoo place in the city. She actually let me crash there for a couple weeks, she was so nice and as a sort of going away present, she gave me this, said that it, you know, make me look tougher and scare off assholes. - (laughing) Oh, right, did it work? - Hm, sometimes.

I lost two hands of poker in a row thanks to you. - Did you really? - (laughing) Yeah. You know, I looked at you and I thought, if I get stranded on an island today, that's who I wanna be stranded with. - Okay. - I'm serious. I mean, I don't know what I love more about you, the way that you tilt your head and arch your eyebrow, when you don't understand something. Or no, even better, the way you play with your hair when you're nervous and there, I love the way you look at me when you want me, you bite your lip and you get like this really serious look in your eyes. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, stop.

Fancy. - And for you, madam. - Thank you. Mm. - And later on, for our main course of the evening, we'll be having, give me a drum roll please, ma'am. (Cara imitating drum roll) Fish! - [Cara] (laughing) Surprise. - I know, but it's birthday fish, should be better. - Okay. - But first, if you don't mind, I like to give a little toast to the birthday girl. (waves lapping) When I first arrived on this island, I was lost. Since being here with you, I realized that this life we're building here, this is where I belong. As long as I have you, I will never be lost another day in my life. Cheers, babe. - Cheers to that. - Mm! - Come here. - "I reach for the satchel, that hangs from the warm, leather strap around my neck. My hands tremble as I struggle to remove the pellets from within. Marco sees it and tries to stop me. 'Wait, we can't let them win.' 'They won't,' I say breathless. We are lost in the depths of each other's eyes for what feels like forever. My heart misses a beat. 'Show them, all must see,' he says. I hold my palm in the air, the pellet out for all to see. I give Marco a gentle kiss on the cheek." - Oh, shit, Emily. (boat engine rumbling) (waves lapping) - Who is that? - I don't know, come on. It doesn't look like a rescue boat. (boat engine rumbling) (waves lapping) (soft tense music) (waves lapping) - Hello? Anyone there? Sandcastles don't just build themselves! Someone's gotta be here! I'm here to help, I have food and water. Oh, you're alive! We've been looking everywhere for you. - Who's we? - And who the hell are you? - I'm Finn, I'm with the rescue crew. - From the boat? - Yeah, I've been looking for survivors. - Oh, my God, do you know anything about my mom? Her name is Lila. - Um. - Mid forties, she kind of looks like me, but she's blonde. - Yeah, yes, Lila, she's on the rescue ship safe and sound. - Oh, my God. - She was asking about you, you're? - I'm Emily, I'm her daughter. - Emily, right and that must make you? - Cara, this is Cara. - Cara, of course. Yeah, we've been finding survivors all over nearby islands. Um, I think we found your mom last week or something. - But she's okay? - Yeah. - That's great news. - Looks like you guys have done a pretty great job. I see you got a hut, books, a fire, doesn't even really look like you need rescuing. - We don't. - Yeah, well, this is all really great, but it's pretty dangerous out here, you know, just the two of you. It is just the two of you, right or? - Ah, it's just us. - Like I said, we don't need rescuing. - Yep, I see that. Just think, warm bed, real food, Mom. No rush anyways, there's not enough room or gas to get back to the rescue ship. We'll have to wait for them here. Gonna take them a week or two to get here. Man, your mom's gonna be so happy to see you. - I can't believe she's okay, she's okay! (laughing) - And in the meantime? - In the meantime, well, mind if I make camp over there by you guys? It's been pretty lonely out in sea and I could use a little company. - Is that chocolate? - Ah, yeah, do you? - Yes. (water lapping) Oh, my God, chocolate! This is somehow better than I remember, oh, my God. - I know you girls don't really know me or anything, so how about I make you a little dinner and you can get to know me? - Yeah, that's probably fine. Do you mind just actually giving us a minute? - Wait, is that the chunky kind? - Ah, yeah, it is. - Oh! Okay, you can set up camp over there. - Sweet, well then, I'll go get my stuff and get set up. - Cool. Do you think we should have discussed this first? - Everyone has their price. Oh, I missed this stuff. - I see your point. Mm. (soft orchestral music) Oh, okay. (soft orchestral music) (waves lapping) You're making me nervous. Yes! Nice! - Not too bad, huh? (hands slapping) - Okay, I wanna do that. - So yeah, bring that foot in a little closer. - My left foot? - Yeah, look at the end and then just a big push, ready? One, two, three. (Emily shrieking) Bend your knees a little bit. - Okay. Cara! Look! (soft orchestral music) (Cara sighing) (fire crackling) - It's amazing what you can do with the right tools. - What the hell? There's flavor in this fish. - Yeah, well, a little natural sea salt and there's a bunch of lemongrass over there, so figured I'd use it. Well, I'd usually use my go-to flavor, peanut butter, but um, someone jacked it all. - Yeah, well, you're never getting that back, so it's a good thing this worked out. - No, she's not kidding. - Okay. - It's like almost gone. - So Finn, what's your story? - My story? I told you, work for the boat company. - She means like who are you? You know, where are you from? What was your life like before? Those kinds of things. - Yeah. All right, well, um. I grew up in a small town just outside of Cincinnati. - No way. ♪ O-H-I-O ♪ (hand slapping) (Finn laughing) - What? - Where are you from? - Cleveland. (Finn laughing) That's really weird. - You're an awful long way from home. - Yeah. I know. My mom was an elementary school teacher, my dad sold farm equipment. I had two younger sisters, Rosie and Kate and last but not least, you got me and I was on my way to OSU on a football scholarship, when everything went down. - That sucks. I'm really sorry. - Yeah. Thanks. My whole family got it, they were all gone within like a month. - Shit, man. I'm sorry. - Yeah. Well then, um, I guess one thing led to the other and I wound up getting a job with the owner of the ship you guys were on and that's my story. - Thanks for sharing. (fire crackling) - Well, um, I'm getting pretty tired, I need to get some shut eye, so if you guys don't mind? But don't worry about all the mess, I'll clean it up in the morning. - Oh no, we got it, it's all good. But yeah, hit the hay. - Thanks for this. - All right. Night. - Night. (soft melodic music) (waves lapping) (Cara and Emily talking indistinctly) - If you insist. - I do. (soft melodic music) (waves lapping) - Wait, what are we gonna do? - I'd rather kiss you. - Ha ha, you know what I mean. - [Emily] I don't. (soft orchestral music) (waves lapping) (objects thudding) (soft orchestral music) (waves lapping) - That's some cache of supplies you got there. - Oh, this stuff? We'll have plenty of this and more on board the rescue ship. - We didn't say we were going on the ship. - Right, well, it doesn't matter much to me, if you'd rather use bamboo leaves instead of toilet paper. - Hey, it's not as bad as it sounds. What are you up to, you wanna come for a swim? There's actually some like really cool stuff, if you get out past the reef. - Sure, now? - Okay. - Hm, nice cards. - Nice shorts.

Hi, guys, strangest thing, I was walking back from the beach and I think, "Boy, am I hungry." And then I think, "Perfect timing, 'cause Finn and Cara are making dinner, you know, since I won the bet and all," then I get here and there's no smell, you know, there's no food cooking at all. Didn't you guys think that's kind of weird? - Yeah, yeah, that was ah, my bad. Got a little carried away with the hut as you can see. - Yeah, we were taking a little break and then one thing led to the next, but I built you a patio. - Oh, it's beautiful. - And I won this for you. - (gasping) Shut up.

(gentle piano music) (radio beeping) - [Man] We'll be there in two days. - Okay, gotta go, over and out. - Roger that. - Hey! - Hey. The rescue ship? - Yeah, they said they're not too far off now. - Any word on my mom? - Yeah, yeah, they said she's really happy and can't wait to see you. (gentle orchestral music) - Do you think I could talk to her? - Um. I'm really sorry, it's just protocol doesn't actually allow it. We're supposed to keep communications down to a minimum, you know, power rations and stuff. Maybe I can get them to make an exception. - Yeah, that, that would be amazing, yeah. (radio hissing and beeping) (Emily sighing) - Sorry, that's weird. - What? (radio hissing) - It doesn't seem to be picking up the channel. - [Emily] What do you mean? - The signal must be scrambled or something. - Okay, well, um, can you reset it? - Ah, to be honest, it might be best to just try later. - Yeah, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. - No, no, don't say that. What were you gonna ask her anyways, about staying here or going with her? - I was hoping talking to her would help me decide. - It's a pretty tough call, huh? - I just feel like I'm forced to choose between my mom and Cara. - Well, (soft melodic music) if Cara loves you, she'll understand. If you ask her to go, she'll go with you. (water splashing) - Going for a fruit run, breakfast, anybody interested? - I'm in. Do you wanna come? - I'm gonna hang back. Thanks though. (water splashing) - [Finn] So I got word that the rescue ship isn't too far off. - [Cara] Oh, yeah, is that what you and Em were talking about? - Yeah. - Watch this. I know she wants to go. (sighing) - Ah, not exactly. - [Cara] Could've fooled me. - It's complicated for her. - There's so many elements involved and I don't even know, I just can't stop thinking about it and it's making me crazy. - She loves you. - (sighing) I know, and I know she'll stay if I asked, right? I mean, you think so? - Yeah, but it is her mother, I mean, do you wanna stay here and risk living the rest of your lives with her resenting you for choosing the island? - No, I guess not. - What are you doing? - I'm coming with you and I know this stuff isn't worth much, but it means something to me. - When did I say I wanted to go? Don't you think this is something we should decide together? - Well, I just, I know how conflicted you've been and I just wanna take the stress off your hands, it's fine. - Cara, I'm conflicted because the truth is I don't wanna go and I feel like crap because of that. - What do you mean? - Being here with you has been the happiest time of my entire life and forget about the fact that the world has gone to shit, you're everything to me now. The way you look at me, you see me, you don't just write me off as some damsel in distress like everyone else does. You know what I can do, you push me to do it. - Well, you just, you make it easy. - I'm not done. I know that when we first got here, I spent a lot of time and energy trying to be rescued. But the truth is, I was rescued the second I washed up on that beach, you rescued me and there's not a single place on Earth, that I wanna be other than exactly right here with you. - I just, I don't wanna be here because- - I know you don't wanna be the reason, you're not the reason, I'm the reason, I'm choosing, I just told you. - Just know I'll come with you, here, home, wherever, I mean, it just, it doesn't matter, just as long as we're together, okay? I just don't want you to regret not going back to your mom, just promise me you'll think about it, okay? - That's the only thing I can think about. - And by the way, I think you were right about Finn. - Yeah? - I guess I'm just too used to waiting for the other shoe to drop, but he's just been on the up and up. I guess my sixth sense was just off this time. If you trust him, I trust him. - I do. - Okay. He's not here. - Yeah, I know, I'm ready. (Cara exhaling heavily) Okay, ready. - Like we practiced, okay. - Yeah. - Okay, one, two, three. - [Both] Help! Help, help! - Ah, help! - Can anybody help? Oh, my God, oh, my God, this is bad! - [Both] Surprise! (laughing) - Oh, my fucking God, you guys scared the shit out of me. - Your face. (laughing) - Sorry, that's probably kind of mean. - Yeah. What's all this? - It's a going away party. - You're not coming? - We don't really know yet, so maybe it's a going away party for you, maybe it's a going away party for all of us. - Either way, it's a party. - Well, in that case, I've got a surprise for you. - No way. - Oh, God. - Yep. - I love surprises. - I hate surprises. - What is it? - [Finn] You're gonna love this one, Cara! - Oh, goodness me. ♪ I wanna get out of my head, out of my head ♪ - Aw, that's a nice touch. - Yeah, I've been holding back, didn't wanna drain the battery, but since the ship's gonna be here pretty soon, I thought why not? - That's good. - What do we have here? (sniffing) Lemongrass coke. - Wow, he's good. - Well, it was either that or peanut butter. - For sure. - Oh, you know, can't go wrong with that. - Here's some gin. - Merci beaucoup. (fire crackling) (Cara laughing) - No and then he, he stomps out there and he is like, "Hey, you babes, hang tight in the kitchen." - "Hang tight in the kitchen." - "I gonna go do man stuff." - I don't sound like that. - Yes. - And then he like struts into the jungle and then all of a sudden you hear like, "Uh!" - No, I think it was more like (screaming)! - And then out he comes with like a single fucking coconut, it's like the saddest fucking coconut I've ever seen. - Single one. - Hey, at least I got a coconut. - I could've done a much better job. - Ah-huh, I'm just saying we would've been eating till breakfast. - Yeah. - This girl can get some coconuts. - I can with my new ladder. - I'm good. - You know what I like about you? - My smile? - No, well, yes, I do like your smile, but I'm talking about this one over here. You know, you're a good one. You know, so many guys would come here and just, just like really take advantage of us, but not you, Finn, you're a good guy. To Finn. - To Finn! - One of the good guys. - Guys, no way, I- - Yes, way, cheers! - Cheers, eyes! - Okay. - Yes, looking in the eyes otherwise it's bad luck. - Yeah. - Here we go. - [Emily] To Finn. - To Finn.

I'm a little worried about the feisty one though, she could put up a fight. - [Man] We'll take care of that, it'll be worth it once we sell them off. - Copy that. Okay, dude, I should go, see you in a few hours. - [Man] Roger and out. (tense melodic music) - Whoa, Emily, you're an early riser. - Who the hell are you? - Let's just calm down. - [Emily] You told me my mother was alive. - I can explain. - Who the hell were you just talking to? - Em, stop, what are you doing? - This guy who's been living with us, who we trusted has been playing us. You were right all along, Cara, my mom's dead, I found her body and a bunch of others at the inlet. There is no rescue ship, everybody's dead. - Is that true? - Let me just explain for one second. - Please explain how you're a fucking trafficker! Explain how you plan on selling us! - What the hell? - You girls don't understand. You're too valuable, they will never let you go. So let's just cut the pretense and do what're meant to do.
