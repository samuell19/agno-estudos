[soft gentle music] [Announcer] And now, direct from the successful, world tour, ladies and gentlemen the Great Zamboni! [audience cheering] [tense music] Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be back. [magical music] Be prepared to have your illusions... Shattered! [glass shattering] -[logo whooshing] -[audience cheering] [ominous upbeat music] [audience cheering] [tense fantastical music] [gentle music] Ladies and gentlemen, my partner on stage and in life, Dawn Starr. [audience cheering] Legend has it that Dawn Starr was ready to be born a human being when an evil spirit saw how beautiful she was and decided to take her as his wife. But the ancient spirits of the sky and the earth said no. He could not have her. So the evil spirit took her, and hid her inside a star. Trapped inside the star, Dawn Starr cried constantly. The spirit of the moon, heard her cries as he crossed the night sky. In the early hours of the morning, as the spirit of the moon began to descend in the west, he could not bear the sound of her crying any longer. He looked upon the star, and blew with all his might! [explosion booms] [soft music] Dawn Starr found herself walking on the Earth.

Hey, mom, Prescott, Yuri, and I wanna go to the clubhouse, so can you watch Max and Zoe? I wanna go to the clubhouse. Me too, I wanna go with Beans. Hey, come on, it's our clubhouse, it's for big kids. It's not fair, it's ours too. And besides, Princess is there and I have to feed her. I wanna go too 'cause they're taking me away soon. I was hoping you'd spend some time with me, Max, before you go. Maybe you two can help fill salt and pepper shakers. Pepper makes me sneeze. Come on, guys, give me a break. I gotta start hanging around with kids my own age before I start sucking my little thumb again. I don't suck my thumb anymore. You guys work it out. Please! Yeah, please. There's nothing you can say that will make me change my mind, no. How about if we give you half our candy on Halloween? [Zoe] Yeah! All right, deal. [upbeat rock music] [suspenseful music] [Dave] Hey, can anybody live next to a graveyard anyway? Even a spooky guy. Best neighbors you can have, they never complain. [Mike chuckles] I don't get it.

Hey, listen, lard brain, let's just see what we can boost in the van and split before the spooky guy gets back and eats us or turns us into cat food or whatever he does to humans, all right? Okay, whatever, stupid. There's a dead guy in here. I know, it's full. Hey, does Boss buy dead bodies and stuff? There's nothing Boss doesn't buy. Open it. -Open it? -Yeah, come on, just open it.

What are you waiting for, Halloween? Let's do it, come on, let's go. [suspenseful music] Well, it don't look used, Boss'd probably get big bucks for this. Okay, does anyone have a match? W-what would we need a match for? Duh. God, I don't know what I would do without you two. Try this with an adult. Get that outta here, come on, let's go! This is illegal, hurry up! [light suspenseful music] [Boss coughing] -[Boss laughing] -[dogs barking] [Boss] Ahem. Hmm. You should really quit smoking, Boss. Never interrupt me when I'm writing my memoirs.

Boys and girls, I have a job for us. [all groaning] Oh, if there's one thing I loathe, it's lack of enthusiasm. Allow me to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that you came to me and when you approached me, you approached a pro, someone who has taken the relatively low business of thievery and raised it to the level of high art.

[laughs] I'm supposed to be home before dark. Me too, I have worrying mother. At least you have a mother. It's okay, Max. You can share our mother anytime you want, big guy. Yeah, mine too. Me too. Thanks, guys. No problem, buddy. [upbeat rock music] [bright music] Oh no! [suspenseful music] Hey, dipwad, where'd you get the goat on a rope? Oh, they don't like us. [Dave]Hey, yeah, why don't you guys like us anyway? 'cause your sociopaths. [Dave] Well, thank you. I bet you don't know what that means. It means I'm gonna give you a fat lip-- Hey, what's the big deal, man, he already has a fat lip. Yeah, he's got fat everything. Shut up, pea-brain. Hey, Dave, chill, all right? I have better stuff in store for these little dorks. [Max] I don't like you. [Mona] Hey! Watch it, yo-yo boy. And I asked you where you got the goat. The goat's mine. Duh, well, what's his name? Princess. She's a he, Zoe, you can't call a guy Princess. That's gonna be one screwed up goat when it grows up. It's my goat and it's a girl, -and that is that. -All right, whatever. Well, you know, she's right, you know-- You know, there's a reason why they call you, specifically, Dumb Dave. Hey, yeah, I was thinking about that one, why is that? Never mind, ju-just leave us alone. -[Zoe] Go away. -[Princess bleats] Hey! All I wanted to do was pet your little goat, all right? But if you're gonna be like that about it, -Fine! -[Zoe] Princess! -[kids shouting] -[Zoe screaming] [Zoe] Princess, no! [Princess bleating] [Yuri retching] You threw up rubber puke, man, how'd you do that? Yo, I think you must've eaten like a lot of junk food or something. [kids screaming] [dramatic music] [somber music] [seagulls squawking] [Zoe] Princess! [All] Princess, Princess! [All] Princess, Princess! [Zoe] Princess! All right. Princess! Princess! -Hey, Princess! -[Zoe] Princess! -[All] Princess, Princess! -[thunder rumbling] Zoe, we cannot keep doing this, we have to go home. Princess! Please! [all] Princess! Princess! [Princess bleating] That's it be. Princess! Princess! -[rat squealing] -[cat meows] [Princess bleating] -[Beans] Oh no! -[Zoe] Princess is going into the Spooky House! [dramatic music] [Beans] No, no, no, Max, wait, wait, wait, Max, don't go in there, the spooky guy might get you. I don't care. He's been feeding little kids to his lion. Yeah, and he's got this big private graveyard just to bury the bones. [Zoe] Yeah, and he never sleeps. [Prescott] He's really a vampire. And he's be 2,000 years old. [Beans] Yeah, and the house is full of snakes. [Prescott]The kind that kill you by poisoning you. Then they wrap around you a hundred times and squeeze you to death. And then the jaws open up like this and swallow you alive. [Beans] And it takes a whole month to swallow you. I know somebody it happened to. He told me about it. [Zoe] And the house is haunted. There are ghosts probably in the hallways at night, just waiting for little kids to scare. True, duck you. Real ghosts, spooky ghosts, spookier than the spooky guy. I know all that stuff. [Beans] So why do you wanna go in there, Max? 'cause I have nothing to live for anyway. Max, you're our friend. We love you. Come on, guys, we're not afraid of that old spooky guy, are we? Are we, yeah, no? [suspenseful music] [eerie music] Well, come on. My mom says no one's ever been inside the Spooky House, Max. Nobody that lived. She says nobody goes there, not even to clean. Nobody knows what is in there. And nobody knows what he does. [gong bangs] [tense dramatic music] [Prescott] He's not home. [Yuri] Therefore, we can go home. [Zoe] We have to get Princess. [Yuri] What is about watch lion? What if he eats Princess? [Beans] No, don't worry, I got an idea. How about we all go in there, catch Princess, and get out quickly, yeah, maybe? [Zoe] Princess! [all] Princess! [Zoe] It's mommy, come here! [dramatic music] [All] Princess! [Zoe] Princess! [Beans] Oh my gosh! [all screaming] [kids crashing] [Beans] Go find the light, go find the light. [laptop clicks] [eerie music] [eerie whispering] [Beans] Go, go find the light switch, go find it. [Prescott] It's right there. [Beans] There. [metal squeaking] [all sigh] Hey, Sir Lancelot, it's a room full of dummies. And I'm not one of them. [chuckles] [lightning crashing] [door knob squeaking] [door creaking] [clock ticking] [eerie music] [clock yelling] [kids screaming] Guys, guys? [bright music] [Sir Lancelot croaking] Hey, Sir Lancelot, come back. [wood creaking] Ow, my head's stuck. [Sir Lancelot croaking] [suspenseful music] Help me, help me! Scared of little spiders, can't get away. Come back. [couch yells] -[couch burps] -[Shadow snarls] [Max] I have to get outta here. [groaning] [Princess bleating] [Zoe] Princess? There you are, Princess. [eerie music] [Princess bleating] It's okay, Princess, mommy is here. [Princess bleating] [lightning crashing] [Prescott grunting] [Zoe screaming] [Beans shuddering] Oh boy, oh boy. [Prescott screaming] [Princess bleating] -[thunder rumbling] -[lightning crashing] [Zoe] Princess. Where are you? [Max] Prescott, is that you? [Zoe] Princess! Hey, Max. [house creaking] [couch rumbling] It's a haunted couch. Uh, there's someone in this house that shouldn't be here. Who? Me. [couch creaking] [all sigh] Hello. [Zoe] Hello. [doll laughing] What's be happen next? [lightning crashes] [shelf creaking] [ominous music] I wish I hadn't come, I'd rather be getting a shot. I'd rather be in gym class. [Sir Lancelot croaking] Sir Lancelot, Lancelot! -Max! -Lancelot! [Beans] Max, Max, come back here Man, I'm gonna regret this. [Yuri] It's be dark in there. [Max] Sir Lancelot. [Beans] Uh, guys, let me know if you see an ugly red guy, pitchfork, tail, horns, ghost, witch, vampire, anything out of the ordinary, just let me know. [Yuri] What if there is be flying rat? [Zoe] You mean a bat. [Yuri] Okay. [Max] Sir Lancelot. [Prescott] If a bat lands in your hair, you won't be able to get it out, you have to cut all your hair off. [Zoe] You're lying, that's not true. [Beans] It is true, ask anybody. They get some kinda glue on their feet. [Max] Sir Lancelot, Sir Lancelot, come on. Where are you? Come on, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lancelot. Sir Lancelot. Hold my candle while I get Sir Lancelot. [eerie music] Hello, Sir Lancelot. [coffin hisses] [people laughing] [lightning crackling] -[people laughing] -[people groaning] [lightning crackling] [lightning crashes] [Zamboni thuds] [soft music] Boo. [angelic music] [coffin whirring] Fingers. [coffin whirring] [soft music] [hand thudding] [Max grunts] [dramatic music] [door rumbling] [soft music] [dramatic music] [wand clatters] [Zamboni sighs] -I like your stuff. -It's not stuff, this wand that you just dropped was a part of the private collection of Houdini. -Hou who? -Stuff. Looks like stuff to me. Great stuff, like great toys. [Zamboni] You know what trespassing means? Yes. Yes, yes, so what does it mean? [Princess bleating] It means when you're somewhere where you're not supposed to be. Exactly, take the goat with you. [Princess bleats] -Were you the Great Zamboni? -I am the Great Zamboni. You're not to tell anyone about this room or me. A magician never reveals his tricks or himself. Now go. This place is wasted. This is a great place for a kid to live with all the cool costumes and really great toys. G-O, go. [somber music] [people chattering] [suspenseful music] I found it. There are articles about him in "Time Magazine," "The New York Times," and even "The Enquirer." Well, that means he was famous. [Max] But how did he make his wife disappear? Maybe it was real magic. [laptop beeps] Here, this is the actual footage of when she disappeared. As the spirit of the moon began to descend in the west, he could not bear the sound of her crying any longer. He looked upon the star and blew with all his might. -[explosion booms] -[all] Woah! Dawn Starr found herself walking on the Earth. But wait a minute, where did she go? She disappeared. [Prescott] The police said he might've murdered her. He wouldn't do that. [tree creaks] Hi, would you show me a magic trick? No. Why, are you scared real magic might happen? There's no such thing as real magic. What about your wife then? [Zamboni] She ran away. Ow, I cut my finger. [Zamboni groans] Get you a bandage. [soft music] Stay there. [door thuds] [dog barking] [door thuds] Thank you. Why would she run away? [door thuds] [people chattering] [seagulls squawking] [Somber music] Hi, it's me, Max. I got this new magic trick, Yuri gave it to me. Can you show me how to make the little ball disappear? Thanks again for the bandage. Hey, look, my finger's much better. -How's your lion? -Jaguar. Did you name her from the kind of car? No, I did not. I know how it's supposed to work but when I do it, it doesn't look right. [bag thuds] Watch. Red ball. Red ball in hand. Close cup. Red ball in hand, red ball in hand. [blows] Red ball disappear. Knock knock. -That was great! -Yeah, you have to hold the cup like this, you see. To disguise the illusion. It's not the trick that's important, it's how you perform it. Empty. Red ball in hand. [blows] Disappear. [All] Whoa. Hey, where did it go? [gasps] Excellent. [all clapping] Reappears in Zoe's ear. [all gasp] Oh my gosh. I don't believe it, that is a great trick. It's not the trick that's important, it's how you perform it. [somber music] [birds chirping] -[door creaks] -[door thuds] Nice tree. Thanks. I thought it had character and would fit in here. Character, huh? I dug it up myself. I think it needs to be watered a lot. Thanks. [soft music] Would you teach me another magic trick? [Zamboni] Maybe some other time. It has to be before November 1st. 'cause that's when they're taking me to the orphanage. I'd like to know some tricks by then so I can make the other kids there like me. [door creaks] [door thuds] [seagulls squawking] [gentle music] [suspenseful music] [Princess bleating] [Princess bleating] Princess! Mommy, mommy! [Max] I bet Mr. Zamboni can help us find Princess 'cause he's very smart. [Prescott] He just knows how to disappear things. [Beans] And they never come back. Come on. [Beans] Max, what are you doing? [gong bangs] [soft music] [Beans] What are you doing, Max? Maybe he's home but he won't answer the door. Maybe he has a reason. [Beans] He does, he hates us. No, he doesn't, he's not used to people. [Prescott] That's an understatement. What is this understatement? It means what you mean, is less than you mean to mean. Oh no, the jaguar's tail is stuck in the couch and it's really hurting her. [Shadow snarling] [dramatic music] -Oh. -Oh no. [Beans] No, you gotta be kidding [Prescott] I'm not going in there near that. [Max] Well, I'm not afraid. Animals always know when you're helping them and they're nice to you. I'm going in. [Beans] Oh brother. Here comes dinner. Guys, I don't think this plan will work. If we let it out, it could reach us. And eat us. She won't eat us, she's friendly. [Zoe] The spooky guy's coming! [all yelling] [Shadow snarling] [Max] I'll help you. Nice kitty, nice kitty. Uh-oh. [Shadow snarling] I'm really tired, Shadow. Really tired of it all. [couch creaks] [couch clatters] [Max] Help, I have to pee, help, I have to pee, please, I have to pee, let me out, hello, who's out there, help, I have to pee, let me out, hello! Shadow. [Max] Help, I have to pee, hello, help, I have to pee. Help, I have to pee, hello, help, I have to pee. Let me out, help, I have to pee, let me out. I have to pee, let me out. Who's out there? Hello, help, I have to pee, I have to pee, I have to pee, I have to pee! I have to pee. Be right back, the pee's about to mount. [bright music] You're gonna wind up in a reform school, not an orphanage if you keep breaking into my house. I looked inside the window to see if you were home. We just came to visit. It's not nice to look into people's windows. I know that, I'm sorry. Still doesn't give you the right to break in, again. But Shadow's tail was stuck in this couch. Shadow's in the hallway, she looks fine to me. Um, excuse me, sir, Shadow's tail was caught on the couch, and Max did save her. What is this? Will you go, all of you, would you just go? I don't wanna see any of you near my house! So go! [footsteps thudding] [soft music] So the evil spirits took her and hid her inside a star. [voice distorts] Hey Prescott, what you doing? Look. [laptop whirring] He says something just before she vanishes. But I can't make it out. So can't you just try to make it louder? I hate children, I hate children, I hate children. I hate children, I hate children, I hate children. I hate children, I hate children, I hate children. I hate children, I hate children. [dramatic music] [Beans] Max. [Zoe] Max. [somber music] [Zamboni] What are you gonna show me, Shadow? [Shadow snarls] What do you wanna show me, hey? This? [Zoe sniffles] [uplifting music] [bright music] [bike screeches] Nice wheels. [rock music] -[Max groans] -Let's go, come on. Let go, let me go! Ow. Aw, did you wittle baby hurt yourself? I'm not a baby. You don't hear me crying, do you? What did you do that for? [Dave] Trying to make the little dweeb cry. Well, now we can't get any money for it, can we? Hey, what's this he's got in his hand? -Oh. -Gimme that. [Dave] What's that in his hand? [Max] Just a stick! Give it to me! No, it's mine, it was Houdini's. Who's Houdini? I don't know, give it back! Looks like real silver. Boss could probably get good bucks for this. It's a magic wand and there's a curse on anybody who steals it. Yeah, and I'm the tooth fairy. You're not the tooth fairy, 'cause my mom's the tooth fairy, 'cause one time I caught her and she was like putting the money under my pillow. Shut up, Dave. Ow. Leave him alone! Stop it! [Mona] Let's split. Stop it! Oh, hun, are you all right? They stole my magic wand. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay, Sir Lancelot? [Sir Lancelot croaks] They stole the magic wand. [Max] Who's Houdini? [Zamboni] Houdini, he was one of the most famous magicians ever. He had a hard life. But he always kept going, he overcame everything they could throw at him. [Max] Kinda like us, huh? [Zamboni] Not always. [water splashing] Have you ever been picked on by bullies? Yeah, my whole life. Then why are you a bully? Me? I'm not a bully. You hate children. Who told you I hate children? You did, it was the last thing you said to your wife before she disappeared. [Zamboni] Quite the magician yourself, aren't you? [Max] We saw it on the computer. Well, bless modern technology, your nose is fixed, you better go. But you said you would fix my bicycle. Right. I did, didn't I? Why did you say you hated children? Sit down. [Zamboni sighs] There's me, okay. On the back row. You were an orphan too? I spent my whole childhood in an orphanage. Always felt different from the other kids. Did you know magic then? No. That's why I want you to teach me some magic tricks. You would be better off if I taught you a good right cross. My momma, before she got sick, she used to tell me not to fight so nobody ever wins. Well, I never knew my mother, so I'm not as lucky as you, there was nobody there to tell me not to fight. Because all the other kids always picked on me, I got into a lot of fights, I had a great right cross. So I spent a lot of time in the basement. Huh, magician came to visit the school once. I didn't see the show 'cause I was in the basement. But I saw him throw away a lot of stuff in the garbage, so later on, I fished it all out. There were some, you know, special cards and tricks and stuff. I played with them till I figured them out. Then I began to make up my own tricks. Did you have any friends in the orphanage? Luther, he was a rat. I bet you like animals more than people. Most people. Animals like Luther and Shadow, they have no pretensions. They are what they are. [Zamboni scoffs] When I was in the orphanage, I promised myself I would not have children 'cause kids could be so cruel but all Dawn Starr wanted to do was to have children, she wanted children more than anything else in the world, she was a real earth mother, I could see in her heart it was her destiny to have children, maybe that's why she was given to me by whomever, I don't know. People used to tell me I'd make a good father, but I screwed it all up. I don't understand this parenting thing. Maybe it's 'cause I never had parents. All I had when I was a kid was a staff, people who went home after work to be with their kids, people who got Christmas and Thanksgiving off so they could be with their families, it was a punishment to have to spend the holidays with us. Were they mean to you? Ah, they weren't mean, really, most of them anyway. Just that I always thought I was a job to them, not a child. I remember I missed feeling part of somebody. I'm afraid. I don't wanna go to the orphanage. [Tools clatter] I was selfish, I told Dawn I needed her to be my assistant. I used to say, "How can I saw a pregnant woman in half?" The truth is I could get any number of assistants. But she was the only one woman I ever wanted as a wife. [Zamboni] What I said to her that night was the cruelest thing I could ever say. That's why I think she ran away. ♪ You got the good thing that I want ♪ ♪ So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme what you got ♪ ♪ Oh, you got the sweet stuff I like a lot ♪ ♪ So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme what you got, baby ♪ [Girl] Wait up!

[soft music] [Child] Trick or treat! [Child] Trick or treat! That's it, I've had it, I've got a hard trick or treating itch, you gotta walk up to every house, some have steps, and then you have to wait, look cute and say, "Trick or treat!" at each house. Do you realize how many houses we've been to tonight? Do you realize how hard it is to be cute at my age? [suspenseful music] Look. There they are. There goes Halloween. Let's follow 'em and see where they hide their stash. A kid's work is never done. [Dramatic suspenseful music] Candy. [laughs] They're bringing me candy. [dramatic music] You've got to think bigger! You've got to think bolder! You stride up to a door. If no one is home and the door is locked, you go in through the window. The most obscure and unobtuse window you can find, break it if you have to, try not to. Once inside, you open your capacious handbags, you place inside them everything marked sterling silver that will fit. Next you turn your attention to the jewelry, I trust you've developed an eye for the real thing by now. [Boss] When by and by your bags are completely full, you blithely skip out through the same window you came in and hurry on home to me. Get it? [Mona] Got it. -Yeah, I get it. -Got it. -Got it. -You got it. Get it. I fondly hope so.

Put your hands up where I can see them. My hands, oh yes, my hands. [air whooshes] Whoa! [Boss coughing] -[gun fires] -[glass shatters] Oops. I never thought he'd be so fragile. [Zamboni] Glad I haven't lost the touch. [gun clicking] Take cover. [Boss] You don't really think that you can shoot me with that thing, do you? [Zamboni] This thing uses black powder, it can blow the roof off this house. So, ma'am, hand it over. [Boss] Mm-mm. America won the revolutionary war with these things. You're a stunning woman.

I was born with a knack for performing magic. It's a genuine gift. [cards whooshing] A wise young friend taught me that when you fight, nobody wins. [bullets clattering] [Zamboni] These used to belong to the Great Houdini, a clever person can escape from them. [Boss] How did you do that? [mut Give me 30 seconds. She can't do it, she's not clever. 60, 60 seconds, I'll be out of these. 60 seconds, she will not get out. Minute and a half. [Dave and Mike grunting] -[bright music] -I'm gonna puke. All my training down the drain. [Zamboni whispering] The Great Zamboni wants his manacles back, excuse me. [Zamboni chuckles] Here, why don't you play with these? [handcuffs clicking] How did you do that? Magic! Young man, you have the makings of a pro. Here, take my card, call me. In about five years. Yeah, more like five to 10. Here, take one of my cards. Great, Max. [car rumbling] [All] Bye! [Yuri] Do svidaniya. [footsteps thudding] Don't wait for me! Will you come to the orphanage and do a magic show? [Zamboni] I don't do magic shows anymore.

[bright music] -[audience gasps] -[audience applauding] [audience applauding] I can tell you, I, I'm glad to be back. [audience applauding] He's my friend. Sure. Got a black handkerchief, what a wave of change. But this is a surprise. [dove cooing] [audience applauding] There you are. How many of you like cats? [audience applauding] Oh sorry, love cats? [Audience] Yes! [audience applauding] Yeah, me too. -[cat meows] -[audience applauding] Now, this little thing is called Buster. [Buster meows] [audience laughing] Now, you would not want to watch her eating. Because her table manners would shock you. If any of you have kittens at home, be careful, please, what you feed them. -[Shadow snarls] -[audience gasps] [audience cheering] The jaguar is my friend too, her name is Shadow. Give me a break. Now, for my last illusion of the evening. -[Audience] Aww. -Aww oh oh. So, I need a volunteer from the audience. [Child] Oh me, me, me. To put their head inside my jaguar's mouth. [Zamboni] Just kidding, just kidding, just kidding. I see somebody umping up and down waving, a small person with great dignity and courage. Yes, sir, you, yes you, come on, come on down.

No, that doesn't help me, see, I'm colorblind, but I kept my eye on this one, and I know it was this one. The jaguar is in that one! Oh well, we're just gonna have to take a look and see, won't we? We'll just have to take a look and see. [rocket clacking] [audience cheering] Take a bow, take a bow. Ladies and gentlemen, you probably thought that I just, picked Max out of the audience by chance but I had a special reason for picking him. You see, Max is a friend of mine and this afternoon, before coming to the theater, I signed the official adoption papers that give me the great privilege of becoming Max's father. [Audience] Aww. Max, we're a family. -[uplifting music] -[audience cheering] Oh, we mustn't forget Shadow, a big hand for Shadow. [audience cheering] [soft music] [uplifting music] [audience applauding] [people chattering] Max, Max, wait! Hey, Max! Hey, Max, Max! You forgot something. [Max] Thanks. No biggie. -[Sir Lancelot croaks] -You know what? See you at your house tomorrow. My house. That's right, buddy. Bye. See you later. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -See ya. -Bye. -Bye, Max. -Bye.
