The best show on Bourbon Street, at the 500 Club. No cover charge. See the whole show. The best show on Bourbon Street. Sara Divine, the hip hypnotist. Let's go. Catch this show. It's the best show. Just relax, fellas. All right, ladies and gentlemen, just a few seconds of seriousness. I want to explain to you exactly what's going to be happening with these boys. Number one, while they're under hypnosis, they will do nothing they consider morally wrong. For instance, they wouldn't shoot anybody or hurt anybody. They are not able to respond to something they feel is morally wrong. They merely imagine whatever I tell them in a bigger, bigger way. One thing is very, very important. No drinking, no talking, no clinking of glasses. You'll notice that no one's even allowed to serve a drink while I'm putting them under, because they must concentrate on the sound of my voice. When they are under, then we can do what we want. We can have fun, we can enjoy ourselves. So I would appreciate complete silence. Thank you. Okay, boys, you will hear only the sound of my voice. You'll put your hands on your legs. You will choose a spotlight and you will stare at that spotlight. At the count of 10, you will be in a deep sleep. You'll hear only the sound of my voice. Ready? One, your eyelids are getting heavy. Two, your eyelids are getting heavier and heavier. Three, your eyelids are about to close. They feel very, very heavy. Four, five, your eyes are closed. You're very relaxed, you're very relaxed. Six, seven, you hear only the sound of my voice. Only the sound of my voice. You're very relaxed. You cannot open your eyes. You will concentrate only on the sound of my voice. Nine, ten, you are completely asleep. You are completely asleep. You hear only the sound of my voice. All right, boys, at the count of three, you will raise your right hand, very tight. You will spread the muscles in your fingers on your right hand. You will not be able to bring them down. Ready? One, two, three. Right hand into the air. Fingers stiff. There's no way. Try to put your hands down. You cannot. You cannot. Fingers stiff and spread. You cannot put your hands down. You're relaxed, you hear only the sound of my voice. They're so innocent in their sleep. Aren't they beautiful? Just look at these gentlemen. Okay, let's have some fun. [LAUGHING] Oh! Okay, guys, arms down. You're in a hot place, a very hot place. You're in the Sahara desert, and you're hotter than you've ever been in your life. It's 105 degrees, and you're hot, very hot. It's 110 degrees. It's 115 degrees, and you're hot. Very, very hot. 112... Freeze! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You believe this guy? Hey, what are you, a stripper in drag? Lovely, lovely. Okay, darling, put the three-pieces away, because you're all in a cold place, a very cold place. You're inside a big, giant refrigerator, and you are colder than you have ever been in your life. [ALL LAUGHING] It's cold. You've never been colder in your life. [LAUGHING] [FADING LAUGHTER] [DISTORTED HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING] Now let's have a big hand for these talented gentlemen. All right! All right, now... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Baby, put these in your bag. Just go ahead and put them in your bag. How was it? It was fine, just saw a lot of colors and stuff like that. Colors? Let's go somewhere where we can dance. That sounds all right.How about it? Let's get out of here. Yeah, okay. Go ahead, baby, go ahead. I'll catch up with you. Hurry up. Don't forget anything, okay? I got it. [LOUD DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES] MAN: Oh, God! CHRISTELLA: Ike? Hey, Ike. [PEOPLE APPLAUDING] What is it? It's... It's all right. Come on, baby. We better sit down. Well, what's wrong? I don't know. I got a little headache, that's all. Maybe a little too much beer. I think we'd better go home. I said it's just a headache. All right, all right, I'm gonna get Tony, and we're gonna get out of here. [SIGHING] Hi. You feeling better? Yeah, I feel all right. I took some more aspirin. That's great, cause I've got something really terrific to show you. [CHUCKLES] Chris, can we cool it tonight, baby? What's happened to my lover man? What's the problem? Christella, please... Not tonight, huh? I've got a lot on my mind tonight. Hey. You sure everything's okay? Yeah, I'm sure, baby. Let's just go to sleep, okay? Uh-huh. MAN: Oh, God! [GUN FIRING] TONY: Something on your mind, man? Hey! No, man. Now you come in here and say you gotta talk to me. Then you just sit there staring into space. You got something on your mind? Nothing, man. Everything's fine. Nothing on my mind. You're fine, huh? Well, how come you put sugar in your coffee without taking it out of the package? Aw, shit. Mmm-hmm. Now you tell me, ain't nothing on your mind. I don't take sugar in my coffee. [LAUGHING] Hey, man, I'm your best friend. You can tell me. Now what's jamming you up? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? Lately I've been getting these headaches, you know. I mean, like, all the time, Tony. Now, they just come on me, like that. I've been getting them for about a week now. I'm turning into an aspirin junkie. Oh, man, sounds like tension to me. Hey, you got a heavy load at school, and you're driving that cab in between. That's bound to get to you. Maybe I got high blood pressure or that hyper... Hypertension. Tension. Yeah. Maybe I ought to see a doctor. Well, look. There's a brother here named Dr. Caldwell. I'll ask him to check you out. But I bet you he tells you the same thing I'm saying to you. Man, you're working too hard. Call him, okay? Say, Ike. You want that strawberry cream pie? Hmm? [INAUDIBLE] Ike.Hmm? Where did you get this? A little secondhand shop over on, uh... I forget. You like it? [CHUCKLING] Oh, sure, but what are you gonna do with it? I mean, it's not exactly you, if you know what I mean. I'm sorry. It's cool. [SIGHING] DR. CALDWELL: You're perfectly healthy. You don't have hypertension or high blood pressure. As for those headaches, they're probably emotional. All I can recommend is that you lay back on the studies a bit, and on the job. Maybe meditate. Smoke some weed. And if the headaches come back, you come back and we'll check further, but I don't think there's any problem. Nothing physical? Ike, don't let that mind of yours play tricks on you. You're a perfectly normal young man who's burning the candle at both ends, that's all. [BAND PLAYING WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN] ...don't go down that way, and she knows it. And she's messing with me, and no one messes with Enoch Land. You hear me? You tell Doris what I said.

And it's a percentage game, you know. You get a good piece of the action. No, no, Enoch, ain't nothing like that, man. I just want to put some money on a number. That's all. Look here. Look here. My man's decided to get down. Man, do you know I've been wanting you to play for over a year now? You know... A dollar. Mmm-hmm. Yes, sir. Good doing business with you, blood.

You wanna cut down on your hours until the exams are over? Hendricks, do you realize how shorthanded I am? Three guys quit on me in the last two months. Gasoline has gone up two cents a gallon. Look, Ralph, I didn't mean to cause you any problems, I just thought... Problems? You don't know the half of it! Insurance is going up this month, this place is falling to pieces, and to top it all, the cops came by. Seems this woman is laid up in the hospital. She claims that one of the drivers roughed her up, beat her up in one of my cabs. And all she can remember is that it was a black guy. Well, I got 30 guys working for me that fit that description, but that'll make the insurance premiums go up, sure as hell. The body shop called saying I owe money on three cabs that they fixed in one month. ELIJA: Everybody say, "Amen." CONGREGATION: Amen! Everybody say, "Amen!" CONGREGATION: Amen!

[ENGINE STARTING] MAN: You said you was gonna leave Elija. WOMAN: [LAUGHING] You're a fool. You said you was coming with me! What kind of money? I give you more money than Elija gives you! Oh, come on. You could never give me what Elija gives me. And if you don't stop, I'll tell him that baby isn't his. [LAUGHING] And he'll kick you out in the street. You fool. [CACKLING] MAN: Oh, God! [HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING] Ike, I was so worried about you. You're drunk. Why? I called up the garage. Nobody knew where you were. I don't know, I thought you had an accident or something. You could have called to let me know you were okay. Bitch! I hate you. Quit flapping your goddamn gums. No! [LAMP SHATTERING] What the hell is the matter with you? Are you crazy? How dare you talk to me like I'm some kind of common, sissified, nigger wimp? What is this shit, anyway? Don't nobody talk to me like that, especially no bitch whore like you! Teach you to fuck with me! I ought to put you...Let go of me! ...in the goddamn street. Come here. You're crazy. Get... Get... Teach her to fuck with me. God damn her! Silly-ass whore. [CLATTERING] [CHUCKLING] Silly-ass bitch! [SOBBING] Fuck with me. Well, stop fucking with me! [J.D. SNICKERING] [LAUGHING] IKE: Chris... Honey... I don't remember doing any of those things. I woke up this morning, you were gone. And you don't remember? Well, that's funny, because... You were so drunk, I'm surprised you even remember your name. Ike, you... You beat me up. You cursed me... And you threw me out of the apartment. Chris... I don't know what to say. I don't see how I could... Oh, honey, listen... I'm sorry. Please forgive me. [CLICKING] She won't talk to you? Yeah. She blew in last night like she had the devil on her tail. She was all hysterical. Took hours to calm her down. I'm flipping out. I'm fucking flipping out. I don't even remember. Maybe I should see a shrink. I mean, I'm cracking up, man. I blacked out. Oh, man, you don't need no shrink, and you ain't cracking up. Now, you under a lot of pressure, and last night you got your head bad and let off some steam, that's all. That's bullshit. Hey, Ike, Christella is gonna be back, man. I think it's a good thing to go upside of a woman's head when the woman starts handing you lip. I mean, believe it or not, they like that. Hey, man, honest to God. I mean, you have got to go into your nigger act on them every once in a while. They gonna push you till you do. They want you to show them where the lines are. You know something, man? It's pretty encouraging that you did what you did. Now, as long as I've known you, you've always seemed to be, you know, sort of repressed. Well, last night, you got tow up and let it all out. Now, that's fantastic, man. I don't know. I do know... That my baby says I beat her up, and I don't even remember. Don't worry about it. She's gonna be back. CARL: Chris, your folks are really worried about you. They called and asked me to talk to you. This guy could be dangerous. Ike is not dangerous. Now, he is going through a thing. He needs time to get his head together. So do I. That's why I left. You don't call that dangerous? This looks worse than it is. I thought you didn't like violent cats. I thought that turned your stomach. [SIGHING] I don't understand you. Now, let's not start in on that, okay, Carl? Because it wasn't about that. Then what was it about? Now, look, my parents didn't call you because you're a friend. They called you because you are a cop. They blew this whole thing out of proportion. Now, your being my ex-husband doesn't give you any right to come back into my life. I told them I would keep an eye on Ike. All right, it's for you. You just don't stop loving someone. I want to make sure he's as cool as you think. Okay? Girl, would you stop thinking about that man? I can't help it, Phyllis. It won't do you any good. I know. Chris! Uh... How you doing, baby? Oh. Speak of the devil. The sooner we talk about this thing, the sooner we get it straightened out. I guess I don't have much choice, do I? Phyllis. Um... About, um... [STUTTERING] The other night... I need you. Chris... Baby, something is happening to me, and I don't know what it is. I've never felt this lost before in my life, baby. I don't know what's happening. I know I did something foul to you. I said some foul things. Uh, I'm sorry, baby. Ah... I want you to come back to me, Chris. It's hard, Ike. I'm just as confused as you are. Now, your head is in a bad place for whatever reason. You beat me up, and yet you say you don't remember. I don't remember. Chris... That's not the point. Now, how can I be sure it won't happen again? I do love you, Ike, and I want to see you get this thing cleared up, but, Ike... Oh, God. I'm sorry, baby. No, no, I'm sorry. Good-bye, Ike. I'll give you a call, and, um...

I told her Hendricks would be dangerous, but she wouldn't listen. She went back to him anyway. Now she ends up half dead and raped. Carl, I'm warning you now. Simmer down. You can't afford to go losing your head over this thing. There's an APB out on him. We'll get him. I wish I could get my hands on him first. I'd blow his goddamned brains away. He's a maniac, George, a fuckin' schizo killer. "J.D. Walker," my ass. What? Ah, the bastard told Chris his name was J.D. Walker. J.D. Walker's been dead for over 30 years. That was the best fucking I ever had. That's 'cause you've been dealin' with the ace. You got to leave? Where you goin', sugar? I got business to take care of. Oh, shit, that's my old man! Shit! Better go talk to him. Sheryl? Hey. What you doing back so soon, baby? You got somebody with you, don't you, bitch? No. No. I...Yeah, you got somebody with you. And I'm gonna kick the son of a bitch's ass. Back off! Yeah, that's right. I fucked your woman. Sucker. Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill ya. I'm gonna rip your ass apart. Come on. This nigger's crazy. I'm the craziest nigger you ever gonna meet. [SCREAMING] Yeah. I'm gonna cut you every which way but loose. I'm gonna kill you! [YELLING] Come on. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! [GRUNTS] You get up, I'll send you to meet your Maker. Now, what you know? Big nigger got some sense. [CHUCKLING] I'm taking your car. Good night, sugar. [LAUGHING] [DOG BARKING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Please! Let me go! [WOMAN SCREAMING] [GUN FIRING] I'll have my revenge! MAN: I'm gonna give you a break, man. I'm gonna mash your face. [VOICES ARGUING] MAN 2: You a big boy now, you can take it. I'm gonna take it, huh? You think I'm gonna take it? I'm gonna take you to the killing floor, and I'll cut you every time! I'm gonna cut you all kinds of ways! It's over! Your life is over! CONGREGATION: Amen! ELIJA: The church say, "Amen!" Amen! Anything that you can conceive and believe in can become true! As long as it becomes a thought in your mind, then it becomes reality! Now, if I had not thought that it was possible for me to change my life, I'd still be in the gutter today! ALL: Amen! We are all... [APPLAUSE CEASES] So you're a jackleg preacher now, huh, Elija? [WOMEN GASPING] Yeah, that's right. It's J.D. Walker. Where's that good-for-nothing brother of yours? [CHUCKLING NASTILY] I got a score to settle with him. [SCREAMING] Why did you come back, J.D.? My business is with Theotis. You never was in this. You tell Theotis to meet me on the killing floor. He know where it is. [LAUGHING] [WHOOPING] [LAUGHING] [CACKLING] Walker turned up dead one night. They never found out who killed him. He was a hustler. Ran a numbers game and a black-market meat racket during the war. He had a lot of enemies and a lot of women. Hmm. Bliss was involved in the underworld in the '40s, and Hendricks is tied to him. But why? Why would a kid like Hendricks even know about J.D. Walker? Carl. Just got a report of some guy fitting Hendricks' description, assaulting, tried to kill a man and his wife with a razor. He took their Continental. We got the license number. What the hell do you mean J.D. Walker is back? He's back. I saw him. He said he has a score to settle with you. It's some hustler running a game. This is what comes of being so open about the past. It's not a game. J.D. Walker is back. Don't you understand? This is a test. God is testing me. This boy is possessed by the spirit of J.D. Walker. Theotis, his soul must be purged of this evil spirit. I must make J.D. understand that his soul won't rest until he comes to grips with this heinous crime he committed. Theotis, it is really my fight. It was I who loved Betty Jo. It was because of me that he killed his only sister. Well... I'll get rid of the fool. No. I will go and talk to him. That almost got you killed once before. Theotis, I've always been indebted to you for saving my life. Now, me and Roberta suffered a terrible loss when Betty Jo was killed. Now, this thing, I must bring this thing to an end. I will walk into the valley of the shadow of death and talk this evil spirit down. Elija, deal with the real world. We don't know what this maniac will do. No, Theotis, just once... Let's do it my way. Okay. We'll both go. [DOOR CREAKING] [DRIPPING] WOMAN: You're crazy. You're such an idiot. [LAUGHING] MAN: You said you was gonna leave Elija! [WOMAN LAUGHING] You said you was coming with me! You're such an idiot. You're such a fool. I gave you money! You could never give me enough money. I give you more money than Elija gives you! If you don't stop, I'm gonna tell Elija that baby isn't his, and he'll kick you out on the street. And if you do, I'll kill you! You wouldn't do anything. You ain't gonna tell nothin'! [LAUGHING] You ain't gonna tell nothin'! [DISTORTED HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING] J.D.: Betty Jo! Oh, God! Murderer. Murderer! Murderer! [DOOR CLICKING] [DOOR CREAKING] J.D.! J.D. Walker! We're here! I've come to save your soul, J.D. Let this feud be over. Let your soul rest. Leave vengeance to the Lord. IKE: Shut up, Elija! Fool! You always been the bootlickin' lackey! You still is a buck-dancin' nigger puppet! You should've stayed in your church, Elija! I told you my business was with Theotis. [WHISPERING] Get out of here! Theotis killed my sister! You took dives whenever that nigger told you to. You the chump, all right, Elija! Theotis killed Betty Jo because she was gonna tell you something! That baby she had wasn't yours! Belonged to Theotis! Roberta... You look just like your mama. I had to do it. Your mama and J.D. were no damn good. Theotis... In the name of Jesus... I made you. You were nothing without me. You were shit. I made you, and she was with you. She had my child, but she was with you. [LAUGHING] She laughed at me, mocked me, threatened to tell. I had to kill the bitch. [GUN FIRES] No! ROBERTA: Papa! [GUN FIRING] Give me the gun, Elija! I'll kill you! Kill you! Papa! Kill him! [SOBBING] [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] [GUN FIRING] [LAUGHING] You're dead! [SOBBING] [PANTING] ROBERTA: I killed him. No. Oh, God. Oh! [SOBBING] Sweet Jesus. [SIRENS WAILING] ROBERTA: [SOBBING] Oh, sweet Jesus. Hendricks! CARL: I'll kill you. [GRUNTS] Carl! Carl! What the hell's the matter with you? No! [SOBBING] Help me, God. What have I done? [SOBBING] What have I done? [WEEPING] DETECTIVE: You live in New Orleans, right? IKE: Yes. Drive a cab?Right. You said you go to law school. Are you married? Not really. Oh, you just living with someone. What's her name? Christella Borden. You can remember that, but you can't remember anything else? Not much. Let's keep on trying. The girl says she did it. I don't believe that for a minute. I want that joker's ass under the jail. Hendricks says he can't remember anything. Of course he doesn't! He doesn't want to be slapped with a murder 1, not to mention forcible rape. You're just pissed off because of the girl. She won't press charges. The son of a bitch raped her! She won't press charges! You're telling me I did all those weird things because I was possessed? ELIJA: It was J.D.'s voice and his manner. Isaac Hendricks was a vessel for God's justice. And now he's free to live his own life. J.D. Walker can rest in eternal peace. You mean... I can just be walkin' down the street and get taken over by some demon out to get revenge on somebody? It can happen anytime, anywhere. You were possessed. There's no doubt about that. But is it over? How do I know it won't happen again? There's no way to know that. [CHUCKLES] Aw, that's crazy. DETECTIVE: All right, let's set the record straight. It's my understanding that in the struggle, the gun went off. Theotis might have even pulled the trigger himself, right? Yes. All right. That wraps it up for me. [CRYING] Papa. I raised you as my daughter, and you'll always be that to me. Come on. Let's go. Ike, I don't want to have to see you in here again. [CHUCKLING] I don't want to be back here again. Thank you, Captain. Bad suit, blood. [LAUGHING] Man, I'm sorry, but I had to. I could use something to eat. That's nothin' new. Oh, yeah, that's his problem. Always eatin'. Hey, man, do you see this? Now, people call this a natural rock formation. [LAUGHING] There's your natural rock formation, man.
