From New York to Tokyo everywhere it's the same We take the same train to the same suburbs Everyone in single file At night, neon lights replace the sunlight And on every radio it's the same disco The day is gray, the night is blue In the cities of the year 2000 Life will be so much easier We'll each have a number on our backs And a star on our skin We'll blissfully follow the herd In the cities of the year 2000 Monopolis There won't be any more foreigners We will all be strangers In the streets of Monopolis Who are these millions of people? Alone in the middle of Monopolis? There's something afoot in Monopolis This city where nothing ever happened Where we wouldn't call the police unless someone lost their dog There's something afoot in Monopolis This newfangled city, this model city With its air-conditioned tunnels And light-filtering glass buildings And suburbs heated with solar power Where there's no more summer, where there's no more winter. There's something afoot in Monopolis This city built for our happiness Is now home to our terror They can't go out after dark in New York or Rome When the sun goes down... The Occident is spooked. There's something afoot in Monopolis There's something afoot in Monopolis When the sun goes down... The Occident is spooked. When everyone is asleep in their suburban dorms You'll see the Black Stars descending on the town Who's been attacking girls in parking lots at night? Who's been torching buildings? It's always the Black Stars So there's panic in the boulevards When we hit the town! When we hit the town, people cross the street We don't look that manly, but give everyone a fright Seeing guys in makeup makes passersby laugh But when they see blood on our razor blades It's like a flash of lightning in the fog When we hit the town! We just want to be happy Be happy before we're old We don't have time to wait till we're thirty We just want to be happy Be happy before we're old We take what we can in the meantime When we hit the town We come out of nowhere We live in the streets, we sleep in warehouses We're quiet during the day We go incognito At night we change our colors and strike at random So get ready for a fight When we hit the town! When the underground city is plunged into darkness Anyone out for a walk will end up on a stretcher We don't have a motive I know that may seem strange Maybe we are just stupid, maybe we're desperate At least, that is what headlines always say When we hit the town! We just want to be happy Be happy before we're old We don't have time to wait till we're thirty We just want to be happy Be happy before we're old We take what we can in the meantime By the year 2000, we'll be in our forties If we don't live it up now, tomorrow it'll be too late What are we doing tonight? Maybe smash everything up? If you go out dancing don't come home too late In case that we scratch your Jaguars Get ready for a fight! There's panic in the boulevards! When we hit the town! From the capital of the occidental hemisphere This is Roger-Roger with a recap of national and international news Ladies and gents, good evening. In the headlines tonight again: the Black Stars. These terrorists keep adding to the list of their gratuitous crimes In the cover of darkness last night a hundred people nearly lost their lives when the ventilation system in an underground habitation out in the industrial zone was disrupted with criminal intent. Elsewhere, a group of motorists with black stars on their brows and guns in their hands attacked the sky rail this morning. An armed convoy has been called to the capital by local police to contain these Black Stars who want to weaken the power during this election cycle. For details, see our editorial.

If we want to keep the world From becoming one totalitarian state The Occident must build a border wall To protect from foreign influence This just in: A message from the Black Stars Taking credit for last night's attack A man called Johnny Rockfort is the muscle of these Black Stars I could tell you something about the Black Stars We see them every night at the Underground Café This is where they plot all of their attacks Under the direction of a certain Sadia A revolutionary A daddy's girl Whose word is always law But from the looks of her You would never know She just got out of university Look, here she is... Sadia! When I walk down the street I hear men murmuring Look at that woman, such allure! You don't see women like that anymore! Is she a fallen star? Is she a rising star? Take a look at that hair! That azure blue hair If you could see me wholly naked Could see me beneath these clothes Gentlemen, you wouldn't be disappointed To find out what I'm really like You'd sell your souls to sleep in my arms You'd leave your wives to run away with me Don't call me "Madam" If you don't know who I am I am not a woman: I am a genderfuck!

We have to break Zéro Janvier He's the enemy number one We have to do everything to stop him From gaining even further ground But I don't think like that! You're exactly what I need to reach my own ends If you follow me, you'll be somebody You'll be the leader of the Black Stars And we'll seize power! Why such a weird name? "The Black Stars"? Because in underground tunnels starlight doesn't reach too far Mr. Johnny Rockfort! Because in underground tunnels starlight doesn't reach too far Mr. Johnny Rockfort! There you go, that's how it all started After that day Johnny never left Sadia's side And the Black Stars were on the front page of every newspaper Deep down, Johnny only wanted to make people talk about him You could say he succeeded We all have to make the best of life But I don't get involved in things that aren't my business I didn't ask to exist I just want to be left in peace I don't want to do what everyone else does But I have to pay my rent I work at the Underground Café I'm just a clockwork waitress And that gives me time to dream Even when I can't stay on my feet I'm always ready to fly away I work at the Underground Café One day you'll see the clockwork waitress get out of this place And start a tomato garden in the sun What will I do today? What will I do tomorrow? I ask myself every morning What am I doing with my life? I don't want anything in particular I just want to be okay I don't want to work just for the sake of working To earn my living, as they say I just want to do something I enjoy I don't know what I enjoy, that's my problem Sometimes I pick at the guitar It's that all I can do with my hands I never wanted to be a star I just want to be myself This life isn't me I work at the Underground Café It's been a long time since I saw the sun In this underground existence Every day is the same here My life has no meaning I'm like a broken neon light I work at the Underground Café One day you'll see the clockwork waitress get out of this place And start a tomato garden in the sun. What will I do today? What will I do tomorrow? I ask myself every morning What am I doing with my life? I don't ask for much I just want to be okay One day you'll see the clockwork waitress get out of this place And start a tomato garden in the sun In the sun In the sun Now it's time for the favorite show of kids of all ages! The number one show in all the polls: Starmania, presented by Cristal, the smiling face of TeleCapital. PRESENTED BY CRISTAL Why is it him, and why not me? Starmania! What's he have that you don't have? Starmania! Would you like to play with me? A game that is called "Starmania"? Write to me, and tell me all About your life, about your dreams Tell me who you wish you were And who knows? Maybe you could be My star for a night! Starmania! Her guest today: Zéro Janvier, head of the PPPP, whom she met in his office in the Golden Tower Where he granted her a passionate, impassioned interview. Here are some of the highlights: Zéro Janvier, you're a man of the future What advice do you have to give To all the kids who dream of success? "Believe in yourself", that's all I can say Every morning I receive tons of mail From kids asking me to give them a shot Look at me, I came from nothing We each forge our own paths Ladies, Lords and Gentlemen Tonight before me is a man who every woman wants to know For a moment, Zéro Janvier, I'll ask you to forget The rich and famous businessman You know my question: If you weren't who you are Tell me who you would like to be? I've been successful in business I've been successful in love I go through a lot of secretaries My office is at the top of a tower From which I see the town upside-down From which I control my own world I've spent half my life in the clouds Between New York and Singapore I always travel first class I have vacation homes In every Hilton on Earth I can't tolerate misery But are you happy? I'm not happy, though I seem to be I lost my sense of humor When I got my business sense I've been successful and I'm proud Deep down I only have one regret I'm not doing what I wanted What do you want, old boy? We do what we can in life, Not what we want... I would have liked to be an artist So I could put on my big act Whenever the plane touches down In Rotterdam or in Rio I would have liked to be a singer So I could cry out who I am I would have liked to be an author So I could invent my life So I could invent my life I would have liked to be an actor To change who I am each day So I could think that I look good On a giant color screen On a giant color screen I would have liked to be a artist So I could recreate the world So I could be an anarchist And live like a millionaire And live like a millionaire I would have liked to be an artist So I could say why I exist... Would you like to play with me? A game that is called "Starmania"? Starmania! Starmania! Starmania, Starmania, that's not me But I know a boy whose only goal Is to be on that show Ziggy, his name is Ziggy I'm crazy about him He's not like the other guys But I can't help loving him Even if I know That he will never love me back Ziggy, his name is Ziggy I'm crazy about him The first time I saw him I threw myself at him in the street And all that I told him Was that I wanted him. It was four o'clock in the morning I was alone and I was in need of talking to somebody He told me "Let's go have a coffee" and we shared the story of our lives We laughed, and we cried Ziggy, his name is Ziggy He's my only friend There's only music in his head He sells records in a shop It's like he exists in another galaxy Every night, he takes me out dancing In places that are fun and gay Where he has so many friends Yes, I know he only likes guys And I should be sensible And try to forget him, but.... Ziggy, his name is Ziggy I'm crazy about him He's not like the other guys And I can't help loving him Even if I know That he will never love me back. I'm a guy born into pollution Nose to the wind, I take a deep breath For me smog is like a drug, I can't do without But nature and clean air, they tend to make me cough Comfy in my own skin like a fish in a stream! I'm a maniac for television Just in playback for some background noise I need din in the night, or I'm an insomniac Don't like birds, don't like toads They make me paranoid When I go nighty-night I need to hear a motorbike The perfume of gasoline, it calms my nerves When I have a headache I smoke a cigarette And when I go jogging among the buildings Feet on the pavement, I'm in my element! Ev'ry Sunday I will stay at home Plug in the sound, turn the volume up Love to hear, near my ear a ringing telephone Countryside makes me blue, it needs more CO2 Comfy in my own skin like a fish in a stream! I'm an agent of consumption When I have dough, I consume to the max Get in debt 'cause I get anything I come across Throw myself like a slave at every new gadget Not a strife in my life, just an average Joe Comfy in my own skin like a fish in a stream! Bravo, bravo, bravo, you just gave a good show! Ziggy, what are you doing here? I wasn't expecting you. I wanted to show you the letter I'm going to send To compete on Starmania What are you going to say? I'll tell them about my life You think that will be enough? Your life? But you don't know my life And I want to tell them too The things that l never told you... Me, I was a mama's boy And every night at bedtime she'd say, "When you grow up..." "You'll play Prince Charming in Sleeping Beauty." In Sleeping Beauty! Every Saturday afternoon While the other boys played Football and volleyball I took ballet classes That must be why you had no friends! When I was fifteen, mother gave me As a special birthday gift A set of Tchaikovsky's complete works! And I ran straight to the store, on the next day, to give it back. That was the day on which I met... The first love of my life: it was David Bowie His music changed your life I changed my name for him You changed your name for him? Ziggy! Ziggy! I left my mother's house I went back to the store and they gave me a job But now I know what I wanna do: Yes now... I'm gonna be a drummer! I'm gonna be a drummer! I wanna be drumming rock! I'm gonna be a drummer I wanna be drumming rock! The greatest drummer in the world! He's not like the other guys And I can't help loving him Even if I know That he will never love me back. So Mr. Disco thinks he's a rock star Johnny, you could show him what a real rock star is You could show him why you're called Johnny Rockfort Competitions for amateurs aren't really my thing I think that if anyone should be on Starmania It's not you, Ziggy, it's rather Johnny! That gives me an idea! I'll call TeleCapital and ask for Cristal And pass myself off as a friend of hers Someone I knew in another life I'll offer her an interview An exclusive with Johnny Rockfort at the Underground Café Underground block 30, corridor B It's the scoop of a lifetime, she can't pass it up It's a hell of a scoop if you're telling the truth It's a hell of a scoop if you're telling the truth Three days late you should have seen Cristal arrive When Johnny Rockfort laid eyes on her, it was all over Like Sadia didn't exist anymore It was all over, Sadia didn't exist anymore... Rolling! Ladies and gentlemen, I have before me tonight Johnny Rockfort... the leader of the Black Stars Who for obvious reasons won't be showing us his face! Johnny Rockfort... everybody talks about you Johnny Rockfort... who are you, where are you from? Who is the real character hiding behind all this makeup? Johnny Rockfort... do you want to be a star? Johnny Rockfort... why the Black Stars? Is your terrorist philosophy ecological or futuristic? I don't care about politics I've never read a newspaper and I'm just as happy! Johnny Rockfort... a product of unemployment Johnny Rockfort... do you believe in marriage? What kind of music do you like? What's your astrological sign? I am Johnny Rockfort I was born in the northern projects I grew up in the streets I didn't choose to be a thug My mother lost her mind Because my father drank too much I dropped school when I was fifteen And I hopped onto the first train Godless, lawless I want to live and die with no house or home I don't want to go back to sleep in the projects I burned all bridges when I left I've got no past, I've got no future There's no future left on Earth. What can we do? There's no future left on Earth. What can we do? I've never worked in my life But I've managed just fine One day I found myself At the Underground Café That is where I met All the friends I have today When I don't know where to sleep That's where I spend the night Godless, lawless I want to live and die with no house or home I don't want to go back to sleep in the projects I burned all bridges when I left I've got no past, I've got no future Godless, lawless I want to live and die with no house or home I don't want to go back to sleep in the projects I burned all bridges when I left I've got no past, I've got no future No past! (No future!) No past! (No future!) No past! (No future!) No past! (No future!) (No past!) No future! (No past!) No future! (No past!) No future! (No past!) No future! No past! (No future!) No past!

I was born on the bright side of life For a long time I stayed an innocent little girl But even I had to move one day I wanted to live my life When your name is "Cristal" You tend to wish upon your star Whether we come from above or below What difference does it make deep down? I'm a lot more like you than you think I always wanted to meet an angel I came into this world crying for help Whether we come from above or below What difference does it make deep down? I came into this world crying for help Whether we come from above or below What difference does it make deep down? I'm a lot more like you than you think I always wanted to meet an angel I came into this world crying for help I need love... A crowd of a hundred thousand, say the organizers Barely fifty thousand, say the detractors Gathered today in the municipal stadium To hear Zéro Janvier unveil his electoral program Zéro Janvier, President of the Occident! Zéro Janvier, President of the Occident! Zéro Janvier, President of the Occident! To stop this new wave of terrorism we'll take extreme measures And impose a return to order if we can't live in harmony: We'll put the capital under martial law. Zéro Janvier, President of the Occident! Regarding the energy shortage, you already know my strategy Once we've emptied all the oceans we'll go live somewhere else than Earth: Our next capital will be a space station. Zéro Janvier, President of the Occident! No more money for shithole countries who only thank us with bombs anyway We must take care of our people first! I am the Occident's last chance. I am the Occident's last chance. We'll build a new atomic world where man won't be a slave to nature Leave the past to the nostalgic few Long live the adventurous future! Ladies and gentlemen, we must interrupt our normal programming. A special bulletin tells us that Cristal, the smiling face of TeleCapital, has been kidnapped during a brawl. She went there with her neutron camera to film the Black Stars in action. You know you can't believe everything they say on TV If you want to know, if you ask me I don't think that she was kidnapped by Johnny I think she ran away with him... There's no future left on Earth Something is off-course In the solar system Is there someone in the universe Who could answer our questions? Our prayers? Our prayers... Who will tell us Why we are here In this world that doesn't fit us Who will tell us Why we are here In this world that doesn't fit us... From New York to Tokyo everywhere it's the same We take the same train to the same suburbs Everyone in single file At night, neon lights replace the sunlight And on every radio it's the same disco The day is gray, the night is blue In the cities of the year 2000 Life will be so much easier We'll each have a number on our backs And a star on our skin We'll blissfully follow the herd In the cities of the year 2000 Mirabelle or Roissy, it's all the same All around the world are the same charter flights To travel where the sky is blue Once we'll forget where to find sunlight We'll move on to Mars or Jupiter Everyone in single file In the cities of the year 2000 Life will be so much easier We'll each have a number on our backs And a star on our skin We'll blissfully follow the herd In the cities of the year 2000 Monopolis There won't be any more foreigners We will all be strangers In the streets of Monopolis We'll walk down the street, hand in hand Just like we did in 1980 Together in Monopolis When our kids hit their twenties We'll be from another time A time before Monopolis I can see us sitting on a bench Alone in the middle of Monopolis The police are all over town It's gotten pretty quiet here No one dares set foot in the Underground Café anymore And I read magazines A glimpse of a sunnier life where they drive limousines And die of an overdose The actress Stella Spotlight, aka "la Divine" Under pressure of the feminist cause threatening to turn her into a martyr decided to give up the film industry. Once she completes her long-awaited film In which, for the first time, she won't be appearing nude The movie is called "Twilight Boulevard" She's obviously not afraid of ridicule! This film is a remake of a famous classic But she will change the plot to better fit her life And then she will retire To her tropical villa To write her memoirs They called me Baby Doll I was your idol But I'm past the age of my image I should tie the knot With an oil tycoon I'm at that age, time to turn the page One day I'll say bye bye To all this show business To all this glitz, to all this stress Bye bye to my youth Oh, come and watch her die The last sex symbol Everyone come applaud The end of an idol I spent my life doing only what they told me Spent my life smothering my own dreams and envies Oh yes... When I go out without makeup nobody ever notices me Not even those who dream of me at night in their beds You only see the surface Of this Technicolor world If you dream of being in my place Come see the other side of the set My drug is alcohol I am old school When I smoke weed it doesn't do it for me I'm afraid I'll go insane Every night I dream of being raped Me, who's always good as a golden image Like my divine image Which you praise and adulate My image in a magazine Onto which you ejaculate Alone in my Acropolis I feel myself collapsing I feel myself collapsing It was just a flash in the pan All this show business Beneath the glitz there was stress There was my youth Oh, come and watch her die The last sex symbol Come and see, come and laugh At the end of an idol I wasted my life, but I won't waste my exit I wasted my life, but I won't waste my goodbye party Goodbye party In front of the whole world's cameras I'll descend the grand staircase That leads to the bottom of my gilded pool Leave me, let me go Leave me, let me die Before I grow old You who stole my whole life Come snatch away my death Leave me, let me go Leave me, let me die Before I grow old You who have taken everything Come and share my corpse Oh yes... I love you all and I blow you a kiss I was only a meteor Do you want to see my death up close? It will be... in Technicolor! Who could have sent me This bundle of orchids? It came with a telegram... And it's signed: Zéro Janvier! Allow me to impose, madame It was with much emotion that I learned of your intention To leave your spectacular career behind Let me remind you what you meant to men of my generation When we were on the front lines defending the nation Goddess of love, goddess of war I kept your photo with me like a talisman You guided my military career, Would you like to govern my political career? Symbol of our values and our freedom Would you honor me by being by my side? Would you honor me by being by my side? In the face of destiny, I'm willing to give in... To celebrate La Divine's farewell the stars were out last night At a grand ball for the premiere of her latest movie at the Monopolis Opera. Stella Spotlight made waves when she arrived at the screening With Zéro Janvier, the Western World's most eligible bachelor Stella Spotlight in Twilight Boulevard Meanwhile, still no news on our friend Cristal Who, we remind you, was kidnapped a month ago, or so we think By the Black Stars I haven't seen Johnny or Sadia since that fateful day Apparently they're hiding somewhere in an old warehouse It would be hard to come out with their girlfriend Cristal They must be concocting some lovely little scandal Some lovely little scandal Dearie, it's now time to claim Responsibility for your abduction Tonight I'm going to write up A shocking press release It would be a stronger move To broadcast on TV A recorded message where I'd yell to the whole world: Help me please, I need love! Help me please, I need love! I think that she is right Let us do it in her way We can see that the little boy Has learned his lesson well Okay, starting from today I'm the one who calls the shots Hey listen, I don't want to be Second fiddle on the team Well no one's keeping you here Do whatever you want Johnny, I'm warning you, you're playing with fire!

I was worried Grab your coffee and I'll be ready Marie-Jeanne, I'm sorry Tonight we're not going dancing I came to tell you something That I guess will hurt your feelings I'm not going to be stopping by Every evening to take you dancing I came to tell you I'm leaving Our planets are parting ways Ziggy, you're my only friend You know I saw Sadia a few times She got me a job as DJ at Naziland Zéro Janvier's nightclub What does Sadia have to do with anything? She has friends in high places So she left the Black Stars behind? If you want to know the truth... Sadia works for Zéro Janvier. Ziggy, you're pulling my leg! Tell me it's not true! Our planets are parting ways From today until forever Don't try to hold me back Don't be angry if I go Our planets are parting ways Like night and day What's the point of living If you have to live without love? What's the point of living If you have to live without love? We sleep pressed one against another We live with one another We caress each other, cuddle each other We understand each other, console each other But at the end of the story We find we're still alone in the world We dance pressed one against another We run after one another We hate each other, tear each other apart We destroy each other, desire each other But at the end of the story We find we're still alone in the world We sleep pressed one against another We live with one another We caress each other, cuddle each other We understand each other, console each other But at the end of the story We find we're still alone in the world But at the end of the story We find we're still alone in the world Still all alone in the world I'm flying, flying, flying away Sitting at the controls Don't ask for anything slow I'm the keeper of the disco It's mechanical music Apocalyptic music I'm flying, flying, flying away Sitting at the controls Sitting at the controls I'm flying away, flying away... I'm flying away sitting at the controls To widespread surprise, the actress Stella Spotlight Has just announced her marriage to Zéro Janvier It will be a simple affair only, at Notre-Dame of the Armies Followed by a massive reception at Naziland The new rotating nightclub on top of the Golden Tower owned by Zéro Janvier The sun is shining on Naziland On hundred-story buildings I've got the whole world in my hand On the hundred and twenty-first floor Tonight we dance, tonight we dance We dance at Naziland We're already deep underground It's back to the catacombs Enclosed in massive tunnels Man never sees his shadow anymore The city has spread its wings Spanning the entire country The neon lights flash in the sky And daytime looks like night Tonight we dance, tonight we dance We dance at Naziland Tonight we dance! Tonight we dance! I know where the Black Stars are I can tell you what they're planning Don't be surprised when you see them among your guests tonight What are you talking about? All the entrances are well-guarded They're planting a bomb right under your feet You'd better go and verify before they can escape They won't get out alive if we get there in time The sun is shining on Naziland On hundred-story buildings I've got the whole world in my hand On the hundred and twenty-first floor Bombs are falling around us No need to dig our graves We'll all die partying But who cares? Tonight we're dancing! Tonight we dance, tonight we dance We dance at Naziland Tonight we dance! Tonight we dance! Tonight we dance! Help me please, I need love... Help me please, I need love... Why do I live, why do I die? Why do I laugh, why do I cry? This is an S.O.S. from an Earthling in distress I've never had my feet on the ground I wish I'd been a bird I'm not well in my skin I'd like to see the world turned upside down It might be more beautiful More beautiful from above From above I've always confused real life with comics I feel a desire to change I feel something Luring me, luring me Luring me from on high In the lottery of the universe I must have drawn the short straw I'm not well in my skin Why do I live, why do I die? Why do I scream, why do I cry? I think I'm picking up waves From another world I've never had my feet on the ground I wish I'd been a bird I'm not well in my skin I'd like to see the world turned upside down I wish I'd been a bird... Sleep, child, sleep... In a moment we'll know the results of the election In exactly three minutes, we'll reveal the name Of the President of the Occident There were many candidates But one person's positions kept making headlines Tonight we'll know if yes or no The popular vote is on his side like the polls predicted. Cristal's brutal death and the arrest of Johnny Rockfort have earned Zéro Janvier a reputation for strength which could lead him to a resounding victory. Folks, it's eight o'clock. The winner is appearing on your screens: Zéro Janvier is President of the Occident! Here he is on the balcony of the PPPP building And Stella Spotlight has just arrived at his side to make a speech Stella Spotlight, we're listening The honor of announcing this victory falls to me Zéro Janvier, the man at my side Ladies and gentlemen, you don't want to believe it But after all, you're the ones who voted This was what the majority wanted Zéro Janvier, President of the Occident! If you want to know the moral of the story Go home, take a look at yourself in the mirror Or just watch me cling to power, See where to can lead a desire to be a star You'll be my victory, I'll be your power Zéro Janvier, President of the Occident! What's the point of wanting to climb so high? What's the point of wanting to be so beautiful? If nothing is left at the end of the show But the heat of a spotlight on your skin The universe is a star system And Earth is a speck of stardust The moon will be my crown At my cosmic wedding The milky way will be my veil, My wedding dress an aurora borealis In front of my mirror I dreamed of being a star I dreamed of being immortally beautiful Tonight I'll see through the mirror Whether life is eternal I would have liked to be an artist So I could put on my big act The way birds need their wings to fly Whenever the plane touches down The way the moon needs the night to shine In Rotterdam or in Rio Help me! I would have liked to be an actor The way the earth needs the sun To change who I am each day The way stars need the stars And so I could look good Help me! On a giant color screen I need love So I could say why I exist My head is pounding I just want to sleep Lay down on the asphalt And let myself die Stone... The world is stone I seek the sunlight in the middle of the night I don't know if the world is turning upside-down Or if it's just me making a scene Making another scene I seek the sunlight in my darkest night Stone, the world is stone I don't want to fight anymore I don't want to run anymore Like all those clockwork people Who build empires Blowing away in the wind Like a house of cards Stone, the world is stone Let me struggle Don't come to my aid Come finish me off instead Put me out of my misery My head is pounding I just want to sleep Lay down on the asphalt And let myself die Let me struggle Don't come to my aid Come finish me off instead To put me out of my misery My head is pounding I just want to sleep Lay down on the asphalt And let myself die And let me die...
