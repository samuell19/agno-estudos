LAVROV Poet - Ye. STEBLOV Winner - I. SHEBEK WANTED A PRINCESS At last! May I... - Who are you, little girl? - I'm a princess. - A real princess? - Are there any false ones? She's soaked to the skin. Poor little thing! May I, Your Majesty? You've got a lovely palace. I like it here. She can hardly stand on her feet, poor child. Come along, Your Highness. - Is that the prince? - The prince. You look just the way I imagined you would. How do you do? You look so funny. What makes you smile? Guess it. Now that's enough talking. Come, Your Highness. Let's go to bed now. Make yourself comfortable. What a funny little creature. She thinks she's a princess. It often happens with girls of her age. She's sound asleep. A lovely child, isn't she? Something tells me she's a real princess. She will have a remarkable story to tell us tomorrow. Princesses don't come themselves. One has to find and conquer them. You'd marry the prince to anybody just to keep him by your side. Tomorrow we'll put her to the test. - To what test? - You'll wait and see. Wake up, Prince. Get up, Prince! - So early? - It's time for you to go. - Go where? - To find a princess. What princess? Yes, papa. Your horse is ready. No use to wait here any longer. I might be dead sooner than you... Than you find a wife, just sitting and waiting here. Yes, papa. May God be with you... Go. Farewell! What have you done? Monster! Why? What have I done wrong? Ride after him at once and bring him back! The fact is we had only one horse. What have you done? Our castle is now childless. My poor child! My poor son! What do you mean, child? He's a man now! He'll be back soon with a marvelous princess. He'll fall into the hands of the first vixen! You forgot... I forget nothing! The boy is well brought up, he's honest, courageous, intelligent! I'm sure he'll make the right choice. He almost fell off his horse staring at some silly girl! Please, you're hurting my ear! My poor unfortunate boy! Our castle is childless now. My heart tells me I shall not see him again. What's the matter? Stop it, my dear. Hey, swineherd, are you of this kingdom? Of course. Where else? And a rotten kingdom it is too. Is there a princess in this realm? There's a lot of everything here, but it's not for the likes of us. Do me a service. Hold me while I climb on your shoulders. For that I'll give you a coin. Why not? Princes always stand on swineherds' backs. - Your kingdom looks prosperous. - What do I care? I'm poor. And who is that, so majestic? Must be the king himself. May the earth open up and swallow him! Girls! How pretty the princess is, how gracious! I wish you were more gracious. If you keep jumping, I'll be a hunchback soon. Now that is a real princess! I'm mad about her! You're crazy all right. Presents! I love presents. - Papa darling, presents. - Your Majesty, presents. I will be happy if these gifts find favor with you, Princess, because since the moment I saw you... Let's have a look. I'm so impatient. What a beautiful rose! Lovely! It's so well done, isn't it? It's better than well done. It's good. What is it made of? Crepe or silk? It's a rose out of our garden. My father cultivated it himself. - Especially for you. - It's not an artificial one. - It's natural, isn't it? - Absolutely natural. Papa, it's just an ordinary rose. Outrageous! There could be still something amusing here. Charmante! Your pronunciation is awful! You should say &quot;charma-a&quot;! - I hope the bird is not real? - A real nightingale. How dull. Swinishness. Well, have you been sent packing? How dare you talk to me like that, swineherd? I'm not a swineherd any more. They chucked you out, but I myself sent those pigs to the devil. I began seeing those pigtails in my dreams. I can't wait to get rid of these filthy rags. If you're so anxious, take them off right now. You mean here? Yes. I'll even pay you for them. What are we going to do today? Let's play forfeits, Your Highness. Not saying &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Not naming black or white. Let papa play this game! Then let's play visiting. Have you forgotten that I'm the king's daughter? Would I ever go to visit you? Or invite you to visit me? Think of something else! What do I pay you for? Come on, invent something! Who is that playing there? That's our new swineherd. I can play this music with one finger on the piano. - Like a swine with its hoof. - A show-off. Big deal. One of you go and ask him what he wants for his instrument. Why does it take her so long to speak to that dirty swineherd? Your Highness, his jug is so wonderful... - How much does he ask for it? - Don't ask me to repeat it... What a boor! How dare he? So that's your highly-praised jug? I didn't praise it, it speaks for itself. It smells of fried pork chops! The smell's from the royal kitchen. That means you'll have pork chops for lunch. I love pork chops! How'd you find out? It's the jug that told me. You have only to ask it what's being cooked, and the smell will tell you. Oh really? You could be lying though. Well, little jug, what will we... You should pay for it first before using it. What are you asking for it? Just ten kisses from the Princess. - He's completely crazy! - The swineherd is crazy! I won't take any less. You can have ten kisses from my ladies in waiting. Either ten kisses from the Princess or the jug stays with me. How boring it is. You must all stand around us so that no one will see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Now we'll be able to poke our nose into everything! But hold your tongue! After all, I'm the king's daughter! Now we might ask it what Lord Chancellor is having for lunch. I suppose he's having ink soup with quills. I feel sick from all those cooking odours. And what will the shoemaker have for hors d'oeuvres? A boot pudding. I've had enough of that music. It's giving me a headache. Nasty little jug. What's that swineherd invented now? We must buy that new instrument. But I refuse to kiss him again. How much is your instrument? - A hundred. - What? Kisses from the Princess. I'll give you ten, the rest you'll get from my ladies in waiting. I don't think I'd like that. If I can do it, then, of course, you can too! - Don't forget that... - You are paying us! You dare to speak before the king's daughter? Either the Princess kisses me, or it's no deal. Stand around us! One! Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! Nine, ten! Eighty! eighty-one... Eighty-three, eighty-four... Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine! A hundred! Swinishness! Out! How unhappy I am! I could have married a handsome prince, but now I'll have to marry a filthy swineherd. So you are a prince! That's different then. Take me to your kingdom right now! No, I feel nothing but scorn for you. There's your chosen one. What do I need her for? I've become a prince myself. Where are you going? Come back. Unfortunate Prince. Wait! Come to your senses! Riding straight into the claws of that witch! What a pleasure to see you! How tall you are! Excuse my informality, but you're my brother-in-law's nephew. And as Crown Prince, you're my relative. All kings are my relatives. And there're so many of them. Come here, I'll give you gingerbread. You must be hungry after yourjourney. I don't eat it, my teeth won't let me. - Thank you. - Let's play chess. It's so magnificent to play chess. The white chessmen are sugar, the black-chocolate. Eat them. You can even eat the king. Or let's go and shoot crows in the castle garden. We've got so many crows there! Go away! Let's go swim in the fountain! It's fun! Thank you, but I would like to be introduced to the Princess. To my daughter? God protect her. We don't need her. - You see, I came to ask... - I know. You want to marry her. Everything was going so well lately. I'd even given up taking the drops the King of Denmark gave me. Oh, how unfortunate! Why unfortunate? Did I make a bad impression? No, on the contrary. That's why it's so awful. Listen, get out of here. But, Your Majesty! - You don't know then? - No. Come here. My daughter is a sweet, well brought-up girl. But every one of her suitors must solve three riddles. And if he cannot, then this... Haven't you tried to forbid these foolish games? I've never been able to deny her anything! Those five guessed right only once. This one... A smart boy, he guessed right twice. No one managed to solve all three. Oh, I like you so much! Why don't you just go away? - I feel like it myself now. - That's just wonderful. She doesn't attract me anymore. Get married and then come back. Now go. That's a clever boy! This door will lead you to the city gates. Come back some day. We'll play chess and shoot crows. Good morning, daughter! You look nice after your ride. Why did you come back? Who is that? He's just passing through... How do you do? You must've come a long way. I'd be willing to circle the world only to have a word with you. The Princess is tired, she needs a rest. Will you excuse me? Rest well. Your Highness, do not think me lacking in respect. Will you stop being so cheeky? I'm here to ask for your hand. Why did you do that? I also liked you the moment I saw you. I'd be glad to accept, but there're certain conditions. I accept all your conditions! In that case, there's no need to wait. Tomorrow at noon, in this hall, three times you must try to guess what I'm thinking of. Rejoice, people of the kingdom! Our Princess has a new suitor! Good night, Your Highness, I hope you'll sleep well. - I guess I won't be able to sleep. - Of course... Take my advice, go to bed and put it out of your mind. Those who thought about it got none of the answers. Say the first thing that comes to your head. For some that system worked for the first riddle. The moon is high tonight! And your horse waits downstairs. - Where is her bedroom? - Her window is right above yours. If I could see her once more, I would die for her willingly! Still, it's easier to face death after a good night's sleep. - I'm here, Troll. - Welcome, my Princess. All through this dreary day my thoughts were only of you. And to me, wandering in the forest, scaling the heights... the shimmering leaves seemed to be the folds of your cloak, the bird's cry seemed to be your voice calling me... And then I saw you standing there and smiling. But it was only the reflection of a rock in the water. Oh, a new spirit in the forest! How handsome you are! You must be from the new stand of birches across the river. How did you guess? My aspen trees are near there. I'm your neighbor. Let's dance, shall we? I'd like to! Only at night can we be together. I wish that night could reign eternally over the earth. - I've got a new suitor. - I know. They need no help from us to rid themselves of the prince. Look at me. - He has bewitched her. - The way you've bewitched me. What should I have him guess? Choose something simple. Your slipper, for example? - And after that? - Think of your glove. - And for the third riddle? - The third? You will not need a third. You're expected in the throne room. Did you sleep well? As well as Your Highness. Tell me what I'm thinking of? Think well, don't rush. I thought you'd be quicker than that. Let him think! Your slipper. - He guessed right. - He guessed right! How smart he is! How about the second thing I thought of? May I kiss your hand? It will give me inspiration. He can't be refused his last wish. Go ahead. What you're thinking of is not on your hand. A glove. He guessed right! Princess, I'm going to save you. Gingerbread for everyone! Lemonade and chocolate! The third one... you'll guess tomorrow. His right guesses make me desperate. But if he can't guess the last one, it will be so dreadful! Then perhaps it's better to let him guess. If he guesses right, I think I will lie. You're incapable of lying. This time think of my head. I have to go. See you tomorrow. Who are you? What do you want? Your head. The suitor... I'll free her from your spell, accursed Troll. I'll cut off your ugly head and take it to the palace in a sack. That will be the answer. Well, let's see which of our heads will fall first. I have no use for your head, Prince. If you die, another prince'll come. I cannot destroy you all. You'd better cut off my head. It's too heavy for me to bear. But I doubt that it'll bring you happiness. Take my head to the princess, and she will die of grief. We've loved each other for a long time. Why don't you marry her then? How could a princess marry a troll, a hobgoblin, cursed by everyone? That would have broken her father's heart. What no one knows is that I'm a prince like you, but enchanted. Only if the Princess were to confess her love for me, would the spell be broken. But she will never do this. She loves her father too much. Then tell her who you really are. No, that way the spell would never be broken. No one could be unhappier than I am. So what good is my head to me? It serves only to make me suffer. Cut it off. Try to guess for the last time what object I'm thinking of. - Why are you silent? - I'm waiting. For the hangman? I've got a head here... No, don't faint. It's not the head you were thinking about. Go to hell with your guesses! Should've hanged him right away. That's a head of cheese to eat on the road, because I'm leaving. And here's the one you were thinking of! Who let that devil in here? She loves him. Let her marry him. She's in love with him? What a shame! You're in love with a troll? Oh God, how disgraceful! Why d'you remain silent, Princess? Stand up for your love! Accursed devil's spawn. I love him, it's true. That means I can hope to have a troll child. A grandchild or two. Well, I prefer to have here a midwife than a hangman. We're going to have a wedding! Open all the wine cellars! Theatres and prisons! - I seem to have dozed off. - I dreamed I saw skeletons. - I've got a cramp in my leg. - Mine feel dead, too. Hello, handsome boy! Why don't we get your birches and my aspens together? You're alive and unmarried still. My trees've burned to the ground, only the ashes are left. Hey, traveller, wait! Stop, please! Listen to me! Stay back! Don't come closer! I'm armed. My aiming is terrible, but I'll get you. - I only wanted to ask my way. - Stay where you are, bandit! You must be after my painting! How can you, a painter, not wish for your painting to be seen? - Especially such a good one! - Do you like it? It's extraordinary! It's the best thing I've ever done. I only hope the Princess will appreciate it! What princess? - You mean you don't know her? - No. What a face, so intelligent, so beautiful and pure! Thank you so much. So, it's only your imagination, not the way she really looks? What great art! How dare you insult our princess? No painter's brush could imitate such perfection! Without her we all would perish. - Who would perish? - Artists, poets, actors. We who serve the fine arts would've been dead of hunger. She has a sense of beauty, she has taste, generosity... She's like the warmth of the sun. I'm not impressed either by riches or renown. The only thing I prize is creativity. I feel I can expect this from you. Do something wondrous, something fantastic. I'll try to. So you'll be one of the contestants? Then I'll sign you up under number... 97. What form of art are you in? Singing or... Let it be a surprise. Wasn't there someone who cancelled out of a better place? Oh, I remember now! The chivalric romance writer is still working on his 3rd volume. He'll finish all the 10 volumes only by your golden anniversary. That makes you number six. To put it better, number one on the second hand. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. Our Master of Ceremonies will see to it. I want to see you the winner. I think I've found the real thing. Today, my soul rejoices. I'll see all that's most wondrous, most fantastic in the whole world. Today I'll choose the winner worthy to reign in my heart. And on the throne. You're all loved equally. Let the losers be not discouraged. And now, Knights of Beauty, the tournament will begin! He who does the most fantastic will marry the Princess. First on our list... Poetry. Just a second... My gambling debt... First draft... Fragments... Scraps... My poem couldn't be lost! Part One! Madam, I'm Adam! How laconic! How melodic! How artistic, yet surrealistic! Abundant in notion and full of emotion. Shall we hear Part Two? Oh, my future Queen! Read my poem from right to left! Madam, I'm Adam! Fantastic! You can read it forwards and backwards. You're a virtuoso! You've got the magic touch! I'm at a loss for words. This aroma... His poem is so short, and life is long. Will his talent be sufficient for a whole lifetime together? We'll think about it. In the meantime I hereby name you our court poet. Pantomime is next. Stand up. Your love is not hopeless. He got poisoned by love. He is unconscious. But the ring was empty. However, his heart was overfilled. He was a genius. Arts call for sacrifice! How cruel. Now we come to number four. Painting! Take the veil off. Your Highness, it's painted. This is fantastic! What mastery of art! What a powerful stroke! - What use of color! - It's incredible! You flattered me. Princess, you're so beautiful! The painter's brush is powerless to convey your charm. I painted your portrait and kept talking to you. I must confess I've fallen madly in love with you! You're more in love with your work than with the original. That love does you honour, I won't dare compete with it. Love your paintings well. And I shall open a palace academy of fine art and shall name you its first president. You're right, Princess. Kings die, but art is forever. Number five. Ballet! You'll be my permanent dancing partner. Where has he gone? He's going to dance around the world and will be back in two years. What a pity. Number six. Here we are for a secret. And secrets are always appealing. I need your help, Princess. That is the most fantastic, the most incredible thing the world has ever seen! But I still have 91 numbers left! We withdraw! This is the most incredible thing. My little princess. WANTED A PRINCESS Come in, traveller. My boy! - Father. - My son. Thank God you're alive and well... As for the princess... we'll do without one. We're happy you're back, Your Highness. You say you're happy? Yes, your father and mother, and everyone who lives here. - Who is she? - Don't you remember her? Just before you left she came to our door. The castle was empty without you. The poor girl had nowhere to go, so we asked her to stay. Now stop fussing, my dear. Sit and have a cup of tea. - No, thank you, really. - Please. Sit down, won't you? What wonderful tea. I smell a pie baking in the kitchen. Oh, it's going to burn! I'll help you. It's the apple pie, my favorite! - Yes, I know. - How'd you know that? You were all anyone talked about here. Why did I leave a place where people cared about me so much? You learn many things traveling! Home is the best place, I've learned that now. - I had to go through many trials. - Yes, I know. Too bad she's not a princess. How do you know that, Your Majesty? I think she's a real princess who happens to have some problems. Oh, the fairy-tale cruel stepmother chased her out of her kingdom. All fairy tales don't necessarily have to be false. When you were hurt, something squeezed my heart. When you were deceived, when your life was in danger, when you were so terribly disappointed... Why didn't I have that feeling in my heart that I have now? - Is something wrong? - No, I never felt better. I tell you that she's a real princess. She helped me over the realm just like a princess should! She has the cleverness, integrity and kindness of a real princess. She's a very nice girl, but a princess is something ethereal. Have you noticed her hands? Well, then look at mine. And am I not the queen? Let's put her to the test. What test? The same test that your mother put me through when I was your fiancee. Rubbish. You could put rocks in her bed without it bothering her a bit. She sleeps on a hard bed and never complains. She is just too polite, as a real princess. All right, do it your way. Careful, Your Majesty. Where are you going? - And where to? - This way. - Are you all right, Your Majesty? - Did I fall? Isn't that enough? No. One, two, three... Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. We need twenty mattresses and twenty down quilts. Otherwise anyone'd feel it. - Where are my slippers? - Right in front of you. I'm ready. - There it is. - Can't be the same one. Time has had no effect on it. My God, I recognize it. That's it. Quiet now. She's coming. Quick, this way! What about me? Over here, Your Majesty. May we come in, dear? See, she couldn't fall asleep. But now she's sleeping. - Yes, but not on the bed. - Nothing could wake her up now. Good morning! Good morning. Did you sleep well? Wonderfully! I had such sweet dreams on that bed. What did I tell you? Then I sat to do some knitting, but the sun was hot and I dozed. Really? Then why have you got red eyes? You're mistaken. Am I mistaken? I hate to admit it, but I couldn't fall asleep last night. I feel like I'm black and blue all over. Do you hear it, Your Majesty? She's all black and blue. It's quite understandable. How could she sleep on such an enormous boulder? Your Highness, who taught you such manners? A relative of yours. And yours. And yours now. Good morning! I heard there was to be a wedding here soon. I have beautiful wedding rings! Wedding decorations! All sorts ofjewelry! I'm ready to trade it all for one ordinary little pea. I'll put it in a glass-fronted cabinet, and all princesses will have nothing to worry about anymore, because no prince will ever be able to find out whether she's a real princess or not. The End
