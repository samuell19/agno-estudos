(whimsical music) (birds chirping) (light music) (truck revving) (babbling) (whacking) (chickens clucking) (crashing) (door slamming) (thudding) (gasping) Oh, Mr. Parker'. Oh, Mr. Parker. Oh, whatever happened? Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself? (muffler booming) Oh! (baby crying) Oh shush, Arnold. That's it, you stay there. Oh, careful, Mr. Parker. (geese honking) Hello? Here, you come and sit over here, Mr. Parker. That's it, I'll make you a cup of tea. You haven't got much to say, have you? (dishes clanking) (chicken clucking) You let your stuff get into a rare mess, Mr. Parker. Don't you have no one to come in and clean the place for you? It's about time somebody did. If I get time tomorrow, I'll come and give the place a bit of a cleanup for you. Oh, that does hurt? (babbling) You feeling better now, Mr. Parker? You wanna take care of yourself or you'll be killing yourself one of these days. Here's your hat, Mr. Parker. You dropped it outside. (dog barking) (baby crying) (kids shouting) You've been gone a long time, Dulcima. I'm sorry, Ma. Children, children, shh! Rowena, Abigail, stop that noise! Your father's having a rest. Go on, get some water in for me, there's a good girl. Oh yeah, all right, Ma. (light music) Be, quiet, Abigail, Rowena, now go on. Go on play, go on. Go on down the field. Dulce! Get me some more tea. I've let this get cold. Dulcima, someone here waiting. (baby crying) Dulce! Dulce! Dulce, get me a cup of tea! Put some water on, Dulce, I wanna have a wash. And I want some new shoes! I've been walking about on bare feet for a week now! I won't be treated like a dog! Hey Dulce, do this Dulce, do that Dulce. I'll Dulce myself out of here one day! Whatever's gotten into Dulcima? (gentle music) (bright music) (chicken clucking) (cow mooing) (chickens clucking) (clanging) How do you feel today, Mr. Parker? Ain't so bad. [Dulcima] Does your head hurt? That's all right. I said I'd come up and give your place a bit of a cleanup. Yeah. You pick up my hat yesterday? I picked it up, I put it in the kitchen. You didn't lose nothing, did you? No, not that I know of. You did not give that henhouse a wallop. (hen clucking) Shoo! (sighing) (motor starting) (light music) (glum music) (light music) (tense music) (toilet flushing) Oh, hello, Mr. Parker. I haven't had much time but it's a bit better. Yeah. Oh. I don't know what you want for your supper but this is all I could find. You'll have to get yourself some new curtains. I ain't got money for curtains. Well you have to. Those others won't stand another wash. Well I ain't made of money. I've got a living to get. What's your name? Gaskain. One of George Gaskain's lot, right? Yes. Which one are you? Dulcima. Ah, that's a funny name innit? What they call you? Dulce or else Dulcie. It's worse than Dulcima. Well I better be off now. They say that curtain material's going up, you know? Well you could save yourself 12 or 13 shillings if you bought it now. Ah. I ain't had no new curtains since the missus died. But it's about time you did. You let me get 'em, I'll fix 'em up. All right you get 'em. (light music) (cows mooing) Hello, Mr. Parker. (coughing) I suppose I must owe you a bob or two. Soon as I get the hand done I'll settle up with you. (clucking) (crashing) Oh, Mr. Parker. You'll have to get yourself some new shirts and underwear. I don't think these'll stand another wash. That'll be all right. That's good ventilation. I shall need some soap. Ah. Dulce? Dulce, you up there? (bell tolling in distance) (cow mooing) Hello, Mr. Parker. Isn't it hot today? Oh it's fair tired me up walking up that hill. I'm sorry I couldn't come up yesterday. That's why I come up early today. Oh, I gotta go and get myself a drink. (scrubbing) (chickens clucking in distance) (pigs snorting) Oh, Mr. Parker. Do you want something? No, love, no. Do you want a cup of tea? No, thanks, no, no. How about you coming up here for good? What? Yeah, that's right, like you know, keep house for me. I couldn't! But why not? Why not eh? I'm willing to pay. I've been meaning to ask you for some time now. I'm very satisfied with the way you work. Yeah, I mean you like it up here, don't you? It's not that. I just couldn't. Well why not? Why not, I'm willing to pay. I don't know, I mean what'll you pay? You keep saying you'll pay but how do I know? Three pound ten a week and your keep, now how's that? I could get more than that working down at the supermarket. Four pound. And I wouldn't have to traipse all the way up here. Anyway, you keep saying you'll pay me, but there's all that what you owe me already. Oh! You didn't think I was gonna forget that, Dulce, did you eh? Tell you no, you didn't think I was gonna forget to pay? No, I've been a bit busy. I know you'll pay, Mr. Parker. Yeah. Well that's right then innit, eh? And the three pound 10 a week you, four pound a week and your keep. I don't know. I'll have to think about it. 'Cause there's other people I got to think about. Other things. Ah. Yeah, right, right. You think think about it. (gentle music) (Dad coughing) [Dad] How much longer you gonna sit there? I can't sleep with the light on. [Mom] I just got this bit and ending to finish. [Dad] You shouldn't have to sit up all hours doing that. Why can't Dulce do it? [Mom] She's got enough to do as it is. Don't you think she works hard enough? [Dad] Yeah but clackers, this is her place here working in this house. - Dad-- - Yeah but clackers. [Mom] Anyway you don't pay her for it. [Dad] Pay her? No you hear when I said - put the light out! - Don't make so much noise, you'll wake the children. [Dad] Put the light out! (coughing) Dulce? You think about what I said? A bit. Ah, that'll be all right then eh? I mean it ain't bad up here is it, eh? You like it here, don't you? Yeah but what am I gonna do with myself all day? There's nobody to talk to. There's nobody up here. Well I'll take you to town Saturdays, market days. There's no need to be lonely. It ain't that. It ain't only what I think. Well who else is it then? Is it your dad? I don't care what he thinks. I don't care about him. Who else then? Well there is somebody else. Well who, who? My boyfriend. My young man. Boyfriend? Well I never knew you had one. Well who is he? What's his name? Albert. Albert. Well you don't think he'd like it? It ain't only that. He gives me money. You know, a few shillings saving every week so we can get things ready, so we can get married someday. Marry? You're gonna get married? Well I hope so. Four pound 10 a week. Now if I give you that, will you come? I'll ask Albert tonight. I should think he'll probably murder me. (dog barking in distance) [Kid] I'll stomp you if I get hold of you. (splashing) (coughing) You stupid useless bitch. I hope we don't bump into Albert. I had to tell him all kinds of tales about you, Mr. Parker. Ah. Well what'd he say? Well he said I could give it a trial. He said I could come up here for a week. Ah. What else? Oh he was a bit jealous. But I said it would be all right. Well never you mind about Albert. Now you keep along with me. I got a few fly deals on today. Oh. (cows mooing) Right then, here we go. Lot one, four nice Friesians, the property of Mr. Bamberg. What can I see for 'em?

And then I can give Mr. Parker here the money. And deduct our commission at the same time. How does that suit you, Mr. Parker? Right. 283.15. 273 pounds 12. Let you down? My partner won't give me the money. Won't give you the money? Gimme a pint. [Mr. Harris] But we made a deal. [Mr. Parker] We'll have to break it. What do you say your name is? Mr. Parker. Look, Mr. Parker. You have put me through considerable trouble. I'm sorry, I can't help it, can I? My partner's let me down. I don't think you're as sorry as you'd have me believe. (door slamming) (cash register dinging) Mr. Parker. I'm hungry. There's a cafe just a few doors down the road. That's a nice place. Are you coming? Mm-mm. I'll be here. I only got three shillings. You can get a good feed down there for three shillings. (light music) Mr. Parker. I just seen Albert. I don't know whether he's seen me or not. But I'm scared of what he might do. We better get home. [Dulcima] That's what I think. Right this way. All right. (kooky music) He lives right here, does he, Albert? Not too far from here. Ah. Come on, Mr. Parker. (light music) [Mr. Parker] What's his work? [Dulcima] Oh he's got a good job. [Mr. Parker] Well what is it? [Dulcima] Well he works at a building site. Construction work. [Mr. Parker] Ah. Well how long you known him? [Dulcima] Oh, going on two years. [Mr. Parker] Two years, oh that's a long time. You get to know a person real well out of two years though. [Dulcima] Yes, sometimes a bit too well, Mr. Parker. [Mr. Parker] Ah. Come on with me. [Dulcima] All right. (splashing) (kooky music) (rasping) (splashing) (classical music) Ah, there you are. Had a bit of a bath? I was wondering if you'd care for a glass of beer in the front room? I was just off to bed, Mr. Parker. I'm fair worn out by everything today. Ah. Tomorrow night. Tomorrow night. Good night. Night. (chickens clucking) (light music) Albert. [Man] Miss Parker? No. [Man] Oh, sorry. You must want Mr. Parker. I don't know where he is right now. Can I help? Please, my name's Ashby. I'm Mr. Morton's new gamekeeper. I have some young pheasants that have a bad habit of straying onto your land. I wondered if it'll be all right for me to come and round them up once in a while. You mean come on to Mr. Parker's land? Yes. Oh, I don't know. He's very funny like that. He don't like strangers prowling around his land. I know. Mr. Morton told me he'd had a few bad words with him a couple of years ago. I wasn't sure if Mr. Parker had forgotten. He gave me explicit instructions to ask first, you see. You let me ask him. 'Cause he's very funny like that. Why he'd very likely blow your brains out. Really? Well I'll keep out of his way then. That's it, you keep out of his way. [Ashby] Right, well the next time I see you, I'll ask. I see you quite often. You do, how? Oh around the farm. I live just over there. Where? In Compton Wood. What, you live in that old house? [Ashby] You know it? Yeah. We used to play in it when we were kids. You must get ever so lonely. Not really. I have plenty to do of an evening. Anyway, I like being on my own. I'd better be off. Look, I'll ask Mr. Parker about the pheasants to tell you later. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. (light music) (tractor chugging) (scraping) Dulce? How many in your family down there? 10. That's including Ma and Pa. Huh. That's a lot of mouths to feed, innit? Does Albert ever come to your house? Albert? Why'd you ask? Oh, no reason, no. Except I saw a stranger in the hayfield this morning. He had a gun. A gun? Yeah. Tall fellow, dark haired, brown jersey with a sort of pattern on it. Is that him? That sounds like him. Yeah, he's got a jersey like that. He's jealous of you, Mr. Parker. He's very jealous of you. Is he there now? No, no, no, no, no. He shot off when he saw me. Yeah. Yeah, he shot off when he saw me. (light classical music) Ah. I was wondering where you was. Hey, what's this? You aren't going anywhere's are you? Oh, I don't know. I get worried. Worried, what about? It's Albert. It's Albert. I mean when people start prowling about with guns, it's time I went back home. No, no, no, don't do that, Dulce, no. For God's sake don't do that, no. You can't do that. I can if Albert says so. Dulce. Hey, Mr. Parker. I don't want you to go. Yeah, but when people start prowling about with guns, besides, you haven't paid me yet. I know. I know, I'll pay you. You keep saying that. That's all I've heard since I came up here. Well how much is it? Hey, for God's sake, now how much is it? How much is it Dulce, how much is it? I don't know, I've got it written down somewhere. Right. 20 pounds 17. And about time too. (clattering from upstairs) 20 pounds 17 shillings. 22 pounds. 23 pounds five. Oh. Oh. Oh, Dulce. Hey. We won't get the money paid like this. I want you so bad, Dulce. I can't get on without you. I can't get on. Yeah, mind my dress. What? Well you're sitting on my dress. I thought you came to pay me the money. Hmm? Oh yeah, that's right. Yes I, I got it here. Well put it on the table then. Hmm? Go on. How much is it? 40 pound. Well I bought a shilling or two. Put it in the drawer, it'd be safe there. Hey. How about Albert? You don't think I ever wanted Albert, do you? Did Albert ever? Does it matter if he did? (laughing) Oh! Oh, Mr. Parker. (laughing) (lock clacking) I'll give him 15 pounds. (kooky music) Mr. Parker? Mr. Parker? Hmm? [Dulcima] Your tea is ready. (groaning) Ooh. That's the money you gave me. I did say 14, didn't I? Yeah, yeah, that's right yeah. Well you gave me too much. You gave me 15. Oh. Did I? That means I gotta give you a pound back. I mean we wanna keep things right, don't we? No, no, no, no. You keep it, eh? Yeah. That's for a little extras. You like the little extras, do you? (snickering) Oh, what are you doing to me? There's a time and place for that sort of thing. (chuckling) No you don't! Oh no you don't! - Oh yeah. - No. - It's my day! - No, stop! [Mr. Parker] Dulce, Dulce! Stop it! Hey! (chickens clucking) Oh! Oh no, no! Ah! Mr. Parker, yoohoo! Wait, Dulce, come here! No! Yoohoo, Mr. Parker! Oh, Mr. Parker! (panting) Ah, I seen you! (light music) [Dulcima] (gasping) Oh, Mr. Parker! Banks? No, you don't want to have nothing to do with banks. Banks ain't no good. No? No, no, they know all your business. They get to know too much. Then the income tax get to know. I ain't paying no bleeding tax, not if I know it. No, they ain't getting nothing away from me. Well I'll put it in the post office then, I'll get interest on it. No, you don't want to do nothing with it. No, you keep it. Keep it where nobody can't touch it, that's all. Well I'll have to see. I forgot. Albert came around again today. Albert? Well what does he want with you now? I don't know. I can't think why he won't leave us alone. I told him. Told him? Told him what? I told him about us. About how we were. About us being on our own and all that, it's over. Cool. Oh cool, Dulce. Oh cool. [Dulcima] Oh Mr. Parker, what are you doing to me, that tickles! (laughing) (birds chirping) Hello. What's that? Oh it's a polecat with a bit of ferret in him. There's something wrong with his leg. Oh I suppose you'll have to kill it. No, I'll put a cast on it. He'll be all right in a couple of weeks or so. Oh I didn't know you was a vet. [Ashby] I'm not, but I used to work for one. [Dulcima] Poor little thing. What a shame. Did you speak to Mr. Parker about the pheasants yet? Well I did mention it to him. He didn't like the idea very much but he said it would be all right as long as he didn't see you. I see. Oh it's not you he don't like. It's Mr. Morton. But as long as he doesn't see you it'll be all right. Right, thank you. Well I better be off. Bye. I hope the polecat gets better. Thank you. [Mr. Parker] Morning. Hello, Mr. Parker. (revving) Ah, cha! (Dulcima crying) Hey Dulce, hey what's this? What's up now? I can't find that money you gave me. Well you must have mislaid it somewhere. I've looked high and low. Well when did you last see it? That day when Albert came prowling about. Albert. We got to put a stop to this. I'll get the police onto him! Oh no, don't do that. We don't want no trouble. (bawling) Now, now, don't cry Dulce, don't cry, don't cry. That won't do no good, won't do no good. Yeah but what have I got now, I ain't got nothing. I paid all that out for the hours and now it's gone! All right, I'll make it up to you. I'll make it up, I'll make it right, I'll make it right. Oh. I made a mistake. I added it up wrong. You put me off that night when you came into the bedroom. It's 24 pounds 10 to me, right? Well it's only a little bit extra. It ain't much. You can't have all the little extras for nothing, can you? [Mr. Parker] Ooh. [Dulcima] Mmm! (light music) I like the way you've had your hair styled. Do you? Yes. It's about time I had it done. Oh, it's very becoming. I don't think you can carry any more. Are you sure you can manage? Yes. I'll carry them up the house for you if you like. Oh no, don't bother. I can manage. Don't you want none for yourself? Oh they grow all around my house. I just can't imagine you living up there. I can't imagine it. You should see it now. [Dulcima] I'd like to. Anytime you like. I'll make tea for you. I will then, thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. (banging) That you Dulce? [Dulcima] Yes. Where you been all this? Oh my God. Hah, what you done all that for? I had my hair done, that's all. Ah. Yeah I like it, yeah. It makes you look different but yeah I like it. But what made you do it? I had it done with that money you gave me. Sure, oh. God, what a sight for sore eyes, eh? Cool. You look good, Dulce. You put some new pictures up? What? No, no, no they're old ones. I'd come across some old things in the shed. I thought they might look good up there, huh? Did you like 'em? Yes. I've been thinking now. I reckon the place could do with an extra set of furniture specially after you fixed it up so good. Yeah, pictures and flowers will make the place sort of homely. Course, I could go for a television. Eh Dulce, eh? Watch the television huh? How about it? - Mmm. - Yeah. Yeah, don't cost nothing now that you bought it. I've been doing quite a bit of thinking lately. I mean, you know how people are, they start talking. Well, I reckon, reckon you and I all get married. Eh Dulce, eh? Eh, get married. How about it, Dulce? I don't know. I'll have to think about it. Well what's there to think about, eh? You know me, you enjoy the place. Hey, it ain't Albert, is it? Good heavens, no. I mean I'd like to. I wouldn't mind. But I'll have to think about it. Ah. Of course, you might have to marry me. Well I wouldn't mind that. I should think not. I'm the one that should worry about a thing like that. Ah. Let me think it over. All right, all right, you think it over. I'll put a few more of these pictures up. Yeah, that'll look nice. All right. Hello Mr. Smith, how's things with you? Oh, can't complain. That's right. Too nice a day to complain. (ducks quacking) You sure, Mr. Parker? Yes, right, two sacks will do. That's three pounds 10 please sir. Here's four pounds, keep the change. Thanks very much, - Mr. Parker. - Thanks Mr. Parker. Will that be your truck here? [Mr. Parker] Yeah that's right over there. (light music) Hello? Hello? (bright music) Hello. I hope you didn't mind me coming in. The door was open. You did ask me. No, I'm glad you're here. Sit down. How about a cup of tea? Thank you. [Ashby] You never told me your name. It's Dulcima. That's Dulcima Parker, isn't it? Dulcima Gaskain. - First I thought Mr. - Parker was your father. What, him, my father? Oh no, I only housekeep for him. Oh I see. Do you stay up there? Not likely, no. I go up every night. I couldn't face living up there. I mean, there's nobody to talk to, nobody to see. Do you live in the village? No, Bristol. [Dulcima] Oh, that's a long way off. I like it here, though. I like the life. My father wanted me to go into the family business along with my brothers. But I wanted to be a vet so I left. I suppose I've cut myself off a bit but at least I'm free to do what I want. And I can talk to people who are interested in the same things as me. How's you're tea? It's nice. (sheep baaing) [Auctioneer] 45, 46? 47, 47, come along now. 47, 48, thank you. 48, 48, you done? 48, 48, and 48, are you done? 49, thank you sir. 49, 49, 49, 49. 50, thank you. 50, 50, 51. 52, 52. (revving) (light music) (crowd roaring) [Announcer] What a shot for Rangers and what a pity that it was out against Storm tactics. I told you I'd get us a television. It's good, innit? (light flute music) [Announcer] The Rangers worked hard to make up their deficit but Celtic were quick to clear and retaliate positively. Yeah. That's just what we need for the winter. I know winters are bad here, you couldn't get out of the place for a month or more. Hey, we can sit and watch the telly. Yeah. Did you think any more about what I said? Well I haven't had time really. What's there to think about so long? I mean, you enjoy it here, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, course you do. I mean you've got the run of the place. You've been getting a full pound 10 a week and your keep. I mean, that's a lot for a girl. I mean that's too much really and we could both all better live on that. Of course you get a bit more when you're married, now. Yeah you get a bit more, Dulce. Yeah. I'd been fly now. Yeah, I been fly. I got quite a bit. You think about that, Dulce, eh? I am thinking about it. Ah. Well I'll give you something to hurry up your mind. You come along with me. Sit down there, sit down there. Look at that, Dulce, look at it. There's money for you ain't it, eh? Ain't you surprised? Look at it! You don't want more than that, do you? I don't want it. See how fly I be? More than I know what to do with. I wanna wait a bit. All right, all right, all right. You wait. Here, here, take a pound or two for yourself. Buy something just for yourself hmm? Dulce, how long do you wanna wait? I don't know, Mr. Parker.

Oh I was just going down the hill. Well I'll walk with you if you like. (revving) Hey, look at my shoes, they're all dirty. Here, I'll clean it for you. Oh, that's all right. We'll do it when we get off the road. Why don't we walk by the stream? There's a path through there. It's very pretty. It leads to the main road. All right. Mhmm. Oh.
