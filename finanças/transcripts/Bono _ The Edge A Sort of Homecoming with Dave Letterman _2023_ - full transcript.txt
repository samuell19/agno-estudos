[clock ticking] [bell chimes] [ticking continues] [Bono] Growing up in Ireland, it felt as if the future was always somewhere else. In our Dublin, it felt as if there were no present, let alone past or future. [Bono] In our band, we felt estranged from any traditions we could have held on to. And the question that began to intrigue us was, "How do we fit into this story?" [clock ticking] I'm looking for the peanut butter cups. [grocer] I don't think we got some here. [scoffs] [announcer on PA, indistinct] Eh, what are those? Just... Just... I don't wanna touch your food. Well, see, now you've touched... Okay. Thank you. [announcer on PA] ...for boarding. Thank you. - You know, what's your name? - Felix. Felix? I'm Dave. Nice to see you. I'm trying to get to Dublin. Take care. Thank you. [announcer on PA, indistinct] I'll tell you what else is, uh, great about the show tonight. This is the biggest, the greatest, most exciting, most influential rock-and-roll band in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, U2. [crowd cheering] ["A Sort of Homecoming" playing] U2, ladies and gentlemen. - [Edge] Hi, Dave. - Oh, my goodness. - A pleasure to see you again. - Good to see you. [Letterman] Thank you for letting me be part of this. Good God. What expectations you have set for yourself. [crowd laughs] Writer, poetry and prose, musician. Something else I forgot. My, um, self-esteem... never been lower. - I just wanna tell you... - [laughs] the door is now closed. - [laughs] - You and I are not gonna be best friends. D-D-Do you like retrospectives of yourself? Do you like looking over your shoulder at this point in your life? No. Okay. Well, that's all we need. Thank you very much. [laughs] Let's... Let's talk about music. Years of reflection has caused you to change lyrics in some of these songs. Some of them you thought perhaps were never finished in the first place. Yeah, that's right. [musicians chattering] We wanted to, sort of, strip away the artifice that inevitably emerges after you've been around this long. [Edge] In the isolation of the pandemic, it was almost like the question became, "What is left when everything is stripped away?" But where do you take it? All right, yeah. Let's take it from the top. Do you... Do you wanna know what I did during the pandemic? - What did you do? - Calligraphy. - Really? - Yeah. - I've gotten very good. - How cool. - Wow. - Yeah. ["A Sort of Homecoming" playing] [Bono] ♪ We'll build a bridge Across the sea and land ♪ ♪ For tonight... ♪ [Bono] In between tours, while Larry was injured, and Adam was off making an art film... ♪ I am coming home ♪ Edge and I asked David Letterman to Dublin to talk about our songs. [Bono] Two, three, four. ["Invisible" playing] And there was certainly a part of me that wanted to hear them again, as if for the first time. And we ask ourselves the nervous question, "Is there any merit to these songs if you take away the firepower of a rock band like U2?" - Hold on. [echoes] - [music stops] Technical, bit of a dropdown.

How are you? - Hello. How are you? How about this? - [baker] Oh, yeah. Wow. - [Letterman] Wow. - [fan] It's your first time here? - It's my first time in Dublin. My first time out of the house, as a matter of fact. Tell us a little bit about this establishment. [shop owner] InDub Reggae Store. - The only reggae shop in Ireland. - The only reggae shop? Yeah, the only reggae shop in Ireland. I'm interested in a wheel of cheese. I've never purchased a wheel of cheese. I would like to buy two hats for friends of mine. - All right. - Their heads are... One's about like this, and one's about like that. [laughs] Is there anyone here that can help an old man carrying a cheese? [tour guide] I'd like to welcome you all today to the U2 walking tour. There are certain bands, when I listen to them, I just see streetscapes open up before me. And Dublin and U2 is deeply connected. In October '77, a great British punk band called The Clash played two gigs in the Examinations Hall of Trinity College, Dublin. And in the crowd was a young, impressionable Bono. Seeing The Clash onstage singing these angry songs was a moment of awakening. Later on, when they're arguably the biggest band in the world, they never really forget this part of Dublin, and everything it does for them. I-I was told there would be a hot meal. [laughs] [Letterman] Let's, uh, go back. - Exactly what you don't wanna do. - [both laugh] How old were you kids when you got together and, uh... So in '76, I would've been, uh, 15. [Letterman] Fifteen? [Bono] That. At age 11, I went to that school for one year. They asked me to leave. Had they not have, I would not have met this man. - Really? - This is true. [Letterman] Tell me about your relationship with the band. When did that begin? [Corbijn] February, '82. - [Letterman] You became close with them? - Close enough. [both laugh] Make sure you got some sun on your faces. Yeah, you're all about shadows, aren't you? [Letterman] But you are part of the family. H-Have you seen them, obviously, change over the years since you've met them? Um, they're the same people, you know? I-I have to say. - [crew] Move in. - Okay, the Edge. This is your calendar shot. [laughs] [Bono] ♪ Monday morning ♪ ♪ Eighteen years of dawning ♪ ♪ I said, "How long?" ♪ ♪ I say, "How long?" ♪ ♪ It was one... ♪ [Bono] I'd say the band was born out of the culture of a particular high school at a particular time. ♪ I was so glad ♪ [Bono] It was a social experiment in our country. It's... It's non-denominational, people of any religion can come, and, more importantly to me, girls and boys. ♪ Boys and girls They go to school ♪ ♪ And girls can make children ♪ ♪ Well, not like this one ♪ We invented a whole culture of our own amongst our friends. We called ourselves Lypton Village. I can't remember why. And in Lypton Village, all our friends were given their own unique nicknames. That's where I got the name "the Edge." [Letterman] Mm-hmm. [Edge] Bono's Village name was "Bono Vox of O'Connell Street." - The-The hearing-aid store? - [Edge] Right. And this was part of a pushback against the conservative society that we were a part of. [Bono vocalizing] - [Letterman] So here we have the Edge. - [Edge] Yeah. - [Letterman] Bono. - Mm-hmm. - [Letterman] Then we have Adam. - Mm-hmm. [Letterman] And we have Larry. When you hear what their original Village names were, you would understand why they didn't run with them. So, Larry's was... He was known as "The Jam Jar." [Letterman] The Jam Jar? [Edge] Adam was "Mrs. Burns." [laughs] The bass player is called "Mrs. Burns." - [Edge] Yeah. - Ah! [Bono] ♪ We got spirit, we got soul ♪ ♪ My brothers and I are out of control ♪ [Edge] We had no aspirations beyond just something fun to do on a Saturday afternoon. But then, weirdly, as we started to play together, and at first atrociously badly, we recognized some chemistry there. My, uh, nickname, "Dumbass." - Yeah. - [both laugh] [bell chiming] [Letterman] You and I last saw one another in the early aughts. [Hansard] The early aughts. We were on doing your show. Our next guests are a pair of talented singer-songwriters who star in the motion picture Once... In those days, I don't think you and I talked much of anything other than here he is, and thank you and good night. Yeah, you stuck your head into the room. We said a quick hello. - [laughs] - It was a big deal. Other than that, we were all told, "Avoid David." - And don't look me in the eye. - That's what we were told, yeah. Hi, Glen. That was beautiful. Excuse me. Your eyes, by the way, stunningly beautiful. Oh, thank you, David. Uh, explain where we are. We're in Dublin. Well, we're in Greystones. So we're on the kind of southern edge of the "swerve of shore bend of bay." - To quote Joyce. We're in... Yeah. - Hmm. Oh, you've been here less than a minute, and you're quoting Joyce. - [laughs] - Good Lord. You know, I'm meeting you. I have to impress you with the Irishness. [Letterman] We're gonna talk about your buddies, U2. [Hansard] Yeah. Well, I've known them pretty much all my life. When I was ten years old, my uncle took me to see the Police, but the opening band was U2. [Bono vocalizing] - [laughing] Oh, my God. - [Hansard] Yeah. Yeah. And everyone, the whole, like... This guy came onstage and he was like... he was possessed. - Everybody left going, "Who were they?" - Mm-hmm. And they were Irish. They were Dubliners. They were from the same town I'm from. And so we all became obsessed. ["I Will Follow" playing] It didn't sound like anything else. Not just in Ireland, but anything else we were hearing from America or from Britain. U2 were completely different. ♪ I was on the outside when you said ♪ ♪ You said you needed me ♪ So not just America, uh, but globally, why do people respond, uh, emotionally to this music? Well, the first time you heard "I Will Follow" on the radio, at that time where everything was trying to show how much you were against everything, you know, U2 was trying to express something with this force of sincerity. They had a purpose and they had an earnestness in their music that you could easily dismiss. Because Bono was just... He was like, uh, he was strident with something pure. ♪ Why, oh, why? ♪ The first album was made... I would've been 18. So we were kids, really, when we started on it. [Letterman] Did you have a vision for your future at all, or was it day-to-day, week-to-week? It was about our concerts and about, you know, the U2 audience live that gave us a constant sense of moving up and moving forward. [Hansard] It was a complete game changer. U2 kind of cleared the decks. Like, any bands that were going, U2 were suddenly, boom. ♪ I was looking through the window I was lost ♪ Nobody ever would've thought that U2 would be the band. Because they were, kind of, just, like, awkward and... But they had something. They had a kind of a... They had a message in their songs. [music ends] Thank you. God bless you. [crowd cheering] [Letterman] Wanna go see a U2 show tomorrow? There's a, uh, free U2 show. - [tourist] Oh. - Yeah. Are you familiar with the band U2? - Yes. Yes. - Have you ever seen them live? Uh, not live, believe it or not. - They're doing a show in town here. - Yeah. Yeah. - Tomorrow night. - [store owner] Yeah. You should come to the show. Just mention my name and you'll get in. Just say, uh, "Dave said it would be okay if I came." Yeah, okay. I'd love to. That'd be a pleasure. Yeah, you should... For God's sake, you should go. Yes. - [tour guide laughs] - My work here is finished. But I think what's interesting now is that I think there's... They're going back to the beginning again. [ticking] [Iovine] Your biggest competition is wanting to be safe. It feels really good to sell 20 million albums, or whatever the heck it is. And you know what that sounds like. But to say, "No, we're gonna change it. And we're gonna bring our audience with us." - [sighs] - How do you sing this warm-up, the Edge? Uh, let me guess. [both humming, vocalizing] Your biggest foe there is your fear of moving forward. [stammers] See, the problem with these is they don't tell you where to go. Oh, we'll find our way. - Don't you worry. - [both laugh] This is a bit of a day, isn't it? Lovely. [concertgoers chattering] - Yeah. Seeing them for the first time. - [laughs] - What a venue. - Yes. - [person] Fantastic. - Yeah, yeah. Is everything you do still within your comfort zone? Rarely. Yeah, the... I'm rarely in my comfort zone. And I think that's been difficult for the band, because I don't let them be in it either. For me, music and songwriting is just, you know, heart surgery. [applause, cheers] [Letterman] Oh, no. Thank you very much. Thank you. Do we have an idea of what we're in for tonight? You will be very, very happy you did have this experience. Are you ready?

To me that sounds unusual. When you compare it to the United States with a rock-and-roll band, it's kids smoking weed in their garage and wanting to meet girls. - We'll get to that. - [laughs] Is that because of Ireland? Well, I should draw you a map. Okay, so... Just give me a second till I get a rough Ireland for you. Okay, that's close enough. So we live on a tiny island in the North Sea, brutalized by occasional bad weather and some difficult neighbors. And in the country of Northern Ireland, the Northern Protestants outnumbered the Catholics. What caused the border to be established? [Bono] Our War of Independence. So who do I dislike in this? - I'm... I'm eager to dislike somebody. - [chuckles] I'm part of the great divide. I wanna dislike... Shall I dislike the British? - No. No. - Okay. - Whoever you don't like, I don't like. - [laughs] So chief among the differences here still would be the religion? [Bono] Well, yeah. [Edge] When we were kids, we were in the middle of the Troubles. [broadcaster] British troops, called to break up a protest, killed 13 Catholics. It was just a constant drip, drip, drip when we were forming the band. [Bono] So, we were looking for a way to express our faith that wasn't obviously religious. And there was a kind of movement in Ireland in the late '70s, uh, which was called Charismatic Renewal. And we met some religious people. They'd no possessions, particularly. They lived a very disciplined life. We thought they were a bit punk-rock actually. And they seemed to accept us for who we are. But they'd, kind of, started to become much more like a conventional church. And it was then that the leadership, sort of, came to us and said, "Look, you should be full-time for God, not this rock-and-roll thing." Music was just something that we had to give up because these people felt rock and roll was kind of nonsense. And that the real job was fixing a broken world. And Edge was in some kind of... Yeah, agony. So it was taken that seriously that it might actually put an end to the band. [Edge] Yeah. Because if we are to be useful, as it were, in music, well, what is... How's that gonna look? So I spent this couple of weeks really trying to figure out what felt right. It was still nagging at us, and the actual answer came in the shape of a song that Edge started. ["Sunday Bloody Sunday" playing] [Edge] And then on one particular day, this rage poured out. [chuckles] This frustration at not being able to write, not knowing if I should be in a rock-and-roll band. Um, what the future might hold. How old were you at this point? Maybe 21. ♪ Can't believe the news today ♪ ♪ I can't close my eyes And make it go away ♪ This was alchemy. And I was watching it. I'm standing beside it. I saw this transformation of internal rage to external. ♪ How long? How long must we sing this song? ♪ ♪ How long? How long? ♪ ♪ Tonight We can be as one ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ And I was like, "Phew! Ah, that's why I'm in a band." - [Letterman] Yeah. - "That's why I'm with this dude." - And that song, "Sunday Bloody Sunday," - [Letterman] Yeah. It was a way to feel our music could mean something outside of just itself. ["Sunday Bloody Sunday" playing] [crowd cheering] We got this broadcast on RTÉ of U2 at Red Rocks. Oh, yes. ♪ Mmm, oh, oh ♪ You could tell from the beginning, they were trying to go stratospheric. ♪ Give it up! ♪ [Hansard] So here's a guy singing about Catholics and Protestants in the north of Ireland, in America. U2 had gone and made our case in front of millions of Americans. And we were getting to see it on TV, and we were gobsmacked. [Bono] ♪ Sing, "No more" ♪ - ♪ No more ♪ - [crowd] ♪ No more ♪ - ♪ No more ♪ - [crowd] ♪ No more ♪ - ♪ No more ♪ - [crowd] ♪ No more ♪ - ♪ No more ♪ - [crowd] ♪ No more ♪ ♪ No more Wipe your tears away ♪ ♪ Wipe your tears away ♪ - ♪ Wipe your bloodshot eyes ♪ - [Edge] ♪ Sunday Bloody Sunday ♪ ♪ Wipe your tears away ♪ - [O'Toole] Because it becomes a hymn... - [Letterman] Yeah. A hymn of despair, of... of... of... of yearning... [Bono] ♪ Sunday Bloody Sunday ♪ [O'Toole] ...just even expressing that, even though it's a pretty bleak thought, giving it expression gives people a lot of courage and... and consolation. ♪ I'm so sick of it ♪ So right now, we've got peace in Ireland. Eventually, I don't know when it will be, I hope it's in my lifetime, when the border goes away, because it's kind of ridiculous having a border on an island this size. And the north and the south will hopefully have more respect for each other. That would be nice. Before it was a cinema, this was part of Rotunda Hospital, this very room. I was born here. Yes, I was. Brendan Behan said, "If you weren't born in the Rotunda, you weren't a proper Dubliner." - [crowd laughs, cheers] - There you go. This next song is the first song, really, we wrote about Dublin. In the '70s, it was a very different Dublin than it is today. A very different country. Uh, very bad. And we called the song, "Bad."

I hear it's great. - That's good. - I'm sure it is. [Letterman laughs] Let me ask you, uh, a question about songwriting. When you're writing a song, and you end up with... ♪ Hoo-hoo Hoo-hoo ♪ [crowd laughs] - Who... Who provided that inspiration? - [crowd laughs] Bec... I'm telling you, it's lovely, but who says, "Okay, here's where you do"... ♪ Hoo-hoo ♪ We like to ask the big questions, so we start with "who?" [Letterman] Uh-huh. And we eventually get to "why." - So, we'll hear "why-why" later? - [Bono] Yeah. - And "when" is coming. - [Letterman laughs] - That's a full night, isn't it, folks? - [crowd cheering] Going back to the "why" of U2, you gotta stay with the "why." And I think the band are on the same page in this one. Yeah, they wanted to entertain, but they didn't want to just entertain. They wanted to do something great. Something that spiritually affected people. And that's the "why." ["Where the Streets Have No Name" playing] [Edge] We grew up as a band on a live stage. That's... That's how we learned to do what we do. And "Where the Streets Have No Name," when I wrote the music, I set myself the specific, sort of, thought exercise of, - "What would I want to listen to"... - Mm-hmm. "if I was in the audience?" What would blow me away? Uh, please do it again because this is an experience I'll never get again in my life, so... ["Where the Streets Have No Name" playing] [Bono] "Where the Streets Have No Name" is an unusual brew of a song. The lyric is not very fleshed out. But the suggestion contained in the lyric is gigantic. And what it seems to suggest is, there's a transcendent place we can go to together.

I recall grappling with the concept of America, and what it meant to me and what it might mean around the world. Um, and that this is a fragile moment. [crowd cheering] - [Bono] I wanted to use some exhortation... - [Letterman] Mm-hmm. taking away normal spectacle, and turning it into a monument of rolling names. The Super Bowl halftimes are a spectacle. But the greatest spectacles are emotions. [crowd cheering] ♪ Oh ♪ [Letterman] I've come to understand the connection about spirituality and religion. You... You feel that, and it doesn't... Doesn't hit you over the head. But you... It's palpable, for sure. ♪ This is all we can do ♪ Well, for me too. I wanna feel that. That's my drug of choice. Uh, the feeling of, not writing a song, but being sung by the song. Sounds a little arty, but it's not... It's... You do... You feel it, um, strongly coming through you. You know, and Brian Eno, who said to us, "You know, you should not be concerned with things like being cool. That would be uncool for you. - Just be yourselves." - Right. You know, and I-I look back now and I realize that's U2's thing, ecstatic music.

And then it changed, and it changed quickly. How did it happen here? The world into which U2 are coming, is a society which has been kind of liberalizing, but is now going back. [laughs] You know? It's... It's getting cold feet about, "Do we really wanna change? Do we really wanna become more modern?" [vocalizing] And this band comes into the middle of that. And I think they formed a, kind of, critical bridge... [singer vocalizing] from being a conservative society to being the place it is now, which is a very open and tolerant society. Oh, my God. Are those real diamonds? - [drag queen laughs] - Holy God. - [drag queen] Dave, Dave. - [Letterman] Oh! You can't leave the building with those. Dressing like a woman makes a lot of money in this culture. [Letterman laughs] - This is your first time to Ireland? - Yes. Mm-hmm. You need to get out more, Dave. [laughs] That's true in almost every aspect of my life. [laughs] Like many things in my life, I'm operating on a... From a position of ignorance. I'm an open book, Dave. - You can ask whatever you want. - Okay. All right. - I'm unshockable. - Yeah, that's good. Is it safe to say that Ireland was among the most repressive toward homosexuality, and has now become almost the diametric opposite? [Bliss] Yes. [bell chimes] I grew up in a country that would absolutely repress any hint of sexuality. Dublin, all through the '80s, was this gray, aggressively normal, if you know what I mean, kind of place. Homosexuality wasn't even heard of. You know, when I was a high school student in the '80s, U2's albums were... They exposed you. Did you respond to those as a kid? See, I didn't. I unfairly maligned U2, because to me, at that time, they were part and parcel of this culture, this sort of straight-boy rock culture that I felt absolutely rejected by. So I left. I went to Japan, um, to... to live and work and do this. And while I was living there, U2 came and performed. And I started to see, oh, actually this U2 is not the U2 that I, you know, unfairly maligned. What I saw onstage in Tokyo was outward-looking, you know? It was sexy and fun. ♪ You're a precious stone ♪ Maybe I'm overselling it, but they were part of the reason then in the end - that I ended up coming back eventually. - Wow.

[Bliss] Oh, right. ♪ Love ♪ [Bliss] It wasn't long after the same-sex marriage referendum. Ireland was the first country in the world ever to bring in same-sex marriage through popular vote. [Letterman] One thing here. So Bono gives you the microphone, do you remember what you said? [laughs] I don't actually. Have you something to say to your people? I'd just like to say I think this might be the straightest audience I've ever played to. [laughs] I would have to check that, Dave. That sounds like work and I don't like to do work. So I would just like to say, on behalf of people like me, thanks a million. - We really appreciate it. - [crowd cheering] Let's get married. Yeah, I found my way back over the years, but not because I changed. [laughs] I'm still the same idiot I was then. But this country changed dramatically. [crowd cheering] U2 was a part of what allowed Ireland to stand on its own two feet. So actually, we have our own thing. I appreciated that at the time and I still do now. Well, good for you. And do you have any questions for me? Um, yeah, I think you've always been, kind of, low-key, a fashion icon, Dave? - [laughing] - You look like a cool dude now. - Cool dude of... What age are you now? - [laughs] - Seventy-five. - Seventy-five. You are a cool-looking 75. - You're a cool-looking... - What do I do about the chest pains? - Oh! Oh! - [Bliss laughs] Dave, if you get chest pains and die here, I'll be cashing in for years. [laughs] I'll have a blue plaque out there, "Dave Letterman"... [both] ..."died here." - Yeah. - [Letterman laughs] There's several theaters in the world where I died. - [Bliss laughs] Yeah. - But this would be an honor to die here. Thank you for that. [Bliss] Thank you so much. [guitar strumming] [Letterman] Your work in particular presents a difficult choice. You're torn, uh, and there is maybe an ultimatum. Which way are we gonna here?

Which is more unlikely: That Ireland is a hundred and better than ever, and the band, uh, 50 years in? To that question, I would say, it's probably the fact that we're a band for this long is a more remarkable thing. We kind of grew up working together and learned how to be, you know, people of the world because of our band. So we're probably, to some extent, oh, a little institutionalized by being in U2 this long. [Letterman] I don't know that I could work with my friends in a creative arena for any length of time. There's many times in the past, I think, that that might've been just pushing our luck a little too far. [sighs] Friendship, it's deeply part of who we are. But you could lose that along the way, and we have to work on it. [Letterman] Do you embarrass the band? Yes, I do. [train whistle blows] My activism, as the band would accept, is fairly unhip work. If you're in a rock-and-roll band, you don't wanna be in a photograph with some people that might be polar opposite to the values that you hold dear. And I did that to them. And... And I'll say it's extraordinary on a few levels because, you know, it's bad for both of our images. [Bono] When I was working with Jesse Helms and we did great work together... Edge just said, "Please, just please, whatever you do, don't bring Jesse Helms, who personally dismantled the National Endowment for the Arts, do not bring him to a U2 show." - And I brought him to a U2 show. - [Letterman] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - [Edge] It was very hard for us. - [Letterman] Yeah. [Edge] There was a lot of tension created by that. I wouldn't have done it, I guess. I probably wouldn't have done it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it... it's an awkward one. It's an awkward one. You know, I'm turning what we create as a band into currency that I choose to spend in these areas. And they, by and large, support me. But I do know I test their patience. And do you feel that this relationship is getting stronger as you guys get older? Yeah. I... I think we acknowledge each other's, um, idiosyncrasies, and they're not... it's not threatening. - And we're also not in competition. - Mm-hmm. It's... It's just part of the way, I suppose, we show respect to each other. [Letterman] Yeah, yeah. [Bono] We have an unusual relationship. As I often explain to the audience, Edge is from the future. And as I often ask him, "How is it?" Which he will always reply, "Better." [chuckles] - Hi, guys. - [Edge] This is digital. It's not actually me. It's not video. - Now I'm confused. That's not you. - No. - That's not a human being? - No. It's a rendering of me as an avatar. Virtual version of me. A replica. Imagine if we could take... - [Edge laughs] - I just... Just promise me you'll always use this for good, not evil. [laughing] [applause] The thing I don't like... - The thing I don't like about you... - [crowd chuckles] The thing I don't like about Edge is that he... he... he doesn't need me. I mean, he could be doing all of this, writing, singing, performing, playing, producing, on his own. - But he doesn't. - Mm-hmm. - Ha ha. - 'Cause it's not as much fun.

There's Dave. - [Siobhán laughs] [Siobhán] So you want me to swim with Dave and pretend that's you? [Letterman] Yes, please do. Yes, 'cause I'm freezing now. [bather screams] [bather speaking] [Letterman] No, no. I can make that sound without getting in. Ooh, is that kelp? [Letterman laughing] Oh, my God! [giggles] This is like there's been some shipwreck, but yet, we've found the survivors. - How was that? - [bather] It was actually very nice. - You enjoyed it? - Feels brilliant. Actually brilliant. - You're happy to be alive? - Yeah. It's amazing. You go into the sea one person and you come out another. - [Letterman] That's lovely to hear. - It's a great change. Try it. Yeah, wait till I get back to the hotel and try it in the pool. [bather] Yes. [Gary] Traditionally, this was only for men. - [Letterman] Until 1974... - [Gary] Yeah, yeah. And then women were allowed. [Gary] I was here when the women rushed in, and hopped in there and swam in there naked. [Siobhán] There's a lovely atmosphere down here. You never come out of a swim without a smile on your face. - [laughs] - And if you've any worries... - If you've any worries, they're just gone. - I understand the smile on your face. - Sort of frozen on one's face. - [Siobhán chuckles] Probably, yeah. Well, let's just see what temperature this water is. [Gary speaking] - [Gary] I wouldn't get too close to that. - No, this is as close as I'm gonna get. - I told you not to let me get too close. - [Siobhán laughs] I have to leave now. Shoes are wet. [Bono] Well, we just want to welcome the Forty Foot man. - He's been out in the Forty Foot... - Yes. [crowd cheers] - and getting splashed around in the bay. - Thank you. I, um... It was on the news, I stripped naked and got in for 45 minutes. [crowd laughs] You've seen more of Dublin in the last three days, he has, than... - You know, I was... - than we have in the last year. This also was a gift. Uh, we went somewhere and got on the DART, and, uh, spent two hours with Glen. Aha, well, there you go. That means you've... Beard-off, beard-off. Glen Hansard and you. He has a beautiful beard, but I... If you ever get a chance to get right up close to him, you'll be hypnotized by his blue eyes. Oh, my goodness, ladies and gentlemen. [piano playing] [Hansard] There's a Moya Cannon poem that probably speaks a lot to the idea of taking songs and what happens to songs and where they go and where music goes. It's called "Carrying the Songs." It was always those with little else to carry who carried the songs. - Deep rhythms... Ah, [bleep]. - [Letterman laughs] Every one of the poems I write, ends in "Aw, [bleep]." [laughs] - Okay, I think I have it. - All right. Okay, one more time. So this idea that... That songs are what we carry... - Yeah. - Even when we have nothing else. Those who are the victors write the history. [Letterman] Yeah. [Hansard] And those who suffered wrote the songs. So we have a lot of songs in Ireland.

[rock music playing on phone] See, to be able to do this, honestly, it's like you guys are a magic act. [Bono] Well, we have some magic for you. We were gonna write a tune for you called "Forty Foot Man." When did this happen?

So, all I want now is the answer to the question, "How do you write a song?" And I don't have that yet. [Edge clicks tongue] Not to get into the weeds too much, but chords are the foundation of all melody. - So, actually, before we get to melody... - [yawns] - [laughs] - we need to find the right chords. I don't agree with Edge on that one. I'm just saying, because think about what you just did to "One." You changed the chords. Same melody. Same words. - You just did it. - Actually, I didn't. [stammers] We changed the key but not the chords. We did well. We nearly got to 50 years, - and in Marsh's Library it all fell apart. - [Letterman laughs] It's coming apart. Well, yes, but the fact you're still doing it, and you're not tired of doing it, - and you're still... - [Edge laughs] You know, I've certainly thought about, um, walking away from U2, - and I know every member has. - No. No. - Yeah, we've... - No, no. No, we have all thought about it, and it's really... Thought about it, but didn't get you out the door. But it's really the right instinct is to question whether this should be a going concern and what it demands of all four members of U2. Mm-hmm. And the reason why I want to go forward is because something is stirring in my voice and in my singing. And this desire to write the song that we haven't got yet, you know? We're sort of chasing the dragon of the song we can't get. - Do you wanna hear another song? - [Bono] Yes. Let's try "Breaking Wave," 'cause we never quite nail the vocal here.
