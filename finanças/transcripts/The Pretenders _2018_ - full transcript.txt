Relax, all right? Relax. Atrocity isn't my usual thing, but you know, I see a crime scene, I feel obligated. I really do, I mean, she was right next to you, man. - Well, what... - Waiting. Waiting.

God, the devil, angels... Various demons. I wore a tie and a blazer to school. Walked with a Bible under my arm till I was 13. - Wow. - Didn't jack off until a year after that. So you got the hell out. As fast as I could. You know what, though? My parents needed it. Thinking that there's somewhere for them to go after their shitty lives run out. Probably the only thing that kept them from offing themselves as soon as they woke up every morning. I don't know, what about yours? My dad, he was in Vietnam. Hasn't been the same since he got back. Mom couldn't handle it. She took off. He and I, we go to the movies, two, maybe three times a week. That was our church, you know. How many girls you've been with? Uh... Oh. Just one. High school. She was kind. Uh, Terry, come on. Remember that girl you blew it with earlier? Yeah? She was an actress. How do you know? You can tell by the way she moves. - How she smoked a cigarette... - Mmm. - You could find her. - How? She was alone, man. A girl like that don't go to that theater by herself only once. Right. Just gotta go when they're playing some French new wave stuff. - Yeah. - You can find her. You can definitely find her. Plus I go there a lot too, so I'll keep my eye out to help you. Help me? Oh, yeah. Right. - She's not my type. - Yeah? I like downtown girls, man. Come on! - Okay, I believe you. - It's all you, all right? - It's all you. - All right. - It's all you. - We'll look for her.

Um, who'd like to get us started this morning? Charlie, sure. It's fluff. Completely frivolous fluff. It's true. He litters his films with references to books, and pop culture and politics, to fool critics into thinking it's some sort of genius. Boo! Okay, okay, settle down. Well, I just think he really loved her. And, how they made six or seven films together and every one of them is a love letter to her. She was his muse. Well, it's the male gaze, right? The directors are almost always male and therefore, we the "audience" get to see the world through a male perspective where women are always passive, erotic objects. You're nasty...

Oh, right. Do you need one? No, no, no. Look, um... I know how this is gonna sound, but I've been coming here just about every night since, hoping I'd see you again. I was starting to think you were from out of town or something. No, I... I'm in a play, but I come here all the time when I'm not working. I'm Catherine. - Terry. So you're an actress. - Yeah. Catherine, I'd like you to meet my friend, Phil. Catherine, that is the perfect name for her. - Right? - Catherine, I'm Phil. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, I'm really confused right now. Can somebody please tell me what's going on? Uh, come have dinner with us. - What? - I, uh... Did Terry not tell you he wants you to be in his movie? I'm a film student. I'm directing a short film, and I want you to be in it. Come and have some dinner with us. - Please. - Come on. - Please? - Come on. You know you want to. Okay, Jesus. Let's... Let's go. So, where are you guys from? Uh, Baltimore. Philadelphia. - Phil from Phily. - That's right. What about you? Oh, I'm from Texas. Texas? But you don't sound like you're from Texas. Oh, I don't sound like I'm from Texas, partner? So, you're in a play? Yeah, we're doing a stage version of Last Tango in Paris. It's a feminist version. I play the Brando part. I heard that Maria Schneider never spoke to Bertolucci again after the butter scene 'cause she felt violated. Yeah, so now the girls get to have the fun. That's so cool. So, how did you get into photography? - Love women. - You love women? I shoot mostly nudes. Well, I'm getting some photos taken tomorrow. I'm gonna be fully-clothed though. - Headshots? - Yeah. Mine are old and getting older. Do you know this person? What sort of name is Laudik? Yeah, that sounds made up. He's supposed to be good. All right. How about you let me do your shoot? - You'd do that? - Sure. - When? - Tomorrow. - Does that work for you? - Yeah, I'm free tomorrow. Good, so you can help me. And y'all two can talk about this short you're working on. Look at the camera. Yeah, give me some sexy in your eyes. - Yes. - Hmm. Not trying to get me to take off my clothes? What, you think I'm a pervert? Yeah, I do. I think you're a pervert. Hmm. That's what I mean. But you got this big smile now. Ow. Hey, is there a timer on that camera? - Oh, yeah. - Okay. Okay, dance with me. - Dance with you? - Yeah, come on. Three, four... Okay. Turn, one, two, three... Ah, Terry! Boys couldn't help but be sucked into her world. She was a force that drew them. Together. Goddamn that's good. Here we are. Now this tie is a very important component is this new chapter of our relationship. I don't think I have to explain to you what this is for. - No. Yeah, I got it. - Okay. May we both have to use it often, huh? I am late. I'm late. I don't think they can start without you. I'm so nervous. Relax. Do the big monologue. You look ridiculous in that make up. Like a caricature of a whore. A little touch of Mommy in the night. I wish you could see yourself. You'd really laugh. You're your mother's masterpiece. Our marriage was nothing but a foxhole for you, And all it took for you to get out was a 35-cent razor and a tub full of water, you cheap goddamn fucking god-forsaken whore. I hope you rot in hell! You're dirtier than the... You're worse than the dirtiest street pig anyone could find, and you know why? You know why? Because you lied! You lied to me. I trusted you, and you lied. Go on, tell me. You pig-fucker. You goddamn fucking pig, fucking liar. Sorry Rosa, I just can't... I can't... Stand to see these goddamn things on your face. You never wore makeup. But this fucking shit. I'm gonna take this off your mouth. This lipstick... Rosa, oh, God, I'm... I'm sorry. I don't know why you did it. I'd do it, too, if I knew how. I just... I don't know how. I... I have to... I have to find a way. Hey, Catherine. Hey. You were incredible. Honestly, you gave Brando a run for his money. - Hey, let's not go overboard. - Yeah, let's not. - Oh, you didn't like it? - It was fine. You did great. Oh, I uh... - Oh, is this what I think it is? - Yeah, I finished it last night. I cannot wait to read it. Uh, what are you up to right now? Um, I'm gonna get a drink with some of my friends from the show. You two are welcome to come. - Sure. - I got a date. I can't. But, uh, I'll see you back at the ranch. Catherine, you did amazing, okay? Thanks. - What's up with him? - I don't know. - Come on! - Oh, come on. Catherine, you were awesome, you fucking pig-fucker. - Pig-fucker. - Better than Brando. Oh, come on. Shut up. You know, Catherine, really, you blew me away. Looks like you got a fan. This is my friend Terry. - Friend? - Terry is a filmmaker and I'm starring in a short film that he's making. - What's the film about? - Yeah, what is this film about? Well, it's... It's a love story. Aw... Well, he did stand outside of a theater every night for weeks looking for me. So romantic! Okay, shut up, shut up, shut up. Let him talk. Well... It's sort of about how we met. Wait, it's about me? - Oh, shit. - Yeah. Ooh, someone's in love. Someone's fucking obsessed with the pig-fucker. - Pig-fucker! - Pig-fucker. Cheers. That was fun. I like my friends. The script! Wait, don't read it now. Why not? I can finish it before we get to my stop. - Please don't. - Why? I don't know. It's embarrassing. That's a good thing. That means you put yourself out there. That's what artists do. Okay, but I can't be in the car when you're reading it. Y'all some weird motherfuckers. Which is fine by me. I like getting paid to do nothing. Shit, we could stand out here all night if you want. Say, man, you ever get that, uh, writer's block? That bad, huh? - Good night. - Catherine. Damn, that was cold. - Terry. - Hmm. - Hi. - Hey. I didn't think I was ever going to see you again. Why are you sleeping out here? - Phil's date. - Oh. Right. Look, whatever upset you about my script... Oh, no. I wasn't upset. Maybe it was too... - Confessional or something? - No, no, no. No, a lot of it was really beautiful. I just... No one's ever written anything like that for me, about me. I got scared. Why? Well, we don't really know each other. I want to know you. I wanna know you, too. I just... Wanna take things slow. As slow as you like. I'm not looking for anything serious. We don't have to be serious. Are you sure? - Hi. - Hey. I've been so anxious to see these. I'm sure you'll be pleased. Wow. These are great. Thank you so much. I... Wish you'd let me pay you. Absolutely not. Excuse me. Can I get a drink for my friend here? - What do you want? - I'll have water. Have a drink with me. You're having whiskey? Uh, I'll have a whiskey on the rocks - with a splash of water, please. - Make that two. Coming right up. - Terry seems very happy. - Mmm-Hmm. Yeah, he's sweet. He says he wants us to be like Godard and Anna Karina. Godard and Karina got divorced. They didn't have a happy ever after. They treated each other badly. That's what people do. I wanna photograph you. You already did. You know what I mean. What do you want from me? - Lot less than Terry does. - What's that supposed to mean? I see the way he looks at you. He had you on a pedestal before he even knew your name. You're not a person to him, you're a cinematic ideal. But I know the truth of Texas. You're flesh and blood just like the rest of us. Plus you and I both know Terry ain't gonna fuck you the way you need to be fucked. It's all too precious to him. That's what all this is about? You wanna fuck me? Once.

No, I'm okay. Let's get the worst of it over with first. Charlie? Well, Truffaut asked that The 400 Blows be judged solely based on its sincerity. Obviously this isn't The 400 Blows, but it felt very sincere to me. I was actually quite surprised. This is one of the best shorts we've seen so far. - Thanks. - Nice work, Terry. Thank you. - Sara. - Yeah, you guys just like it because it's written from a male's point of view. I agree with Sara. I'm surprised too. I have to say, I was expecting something more. Terry, you talk about using film to think, to dig deeper into the world, but all I see up there is obsession with the outside of this woman. Her face, her moley chest, just her body, I don't think you have the slightest idea who she really is. Oh! Terry, the fucking tie's on the door. - Ugh. - Shit. Hey! Hey! Terry! Te... It didn't mean anything. It was just sex. Look, someone swiped the tie off my fucking door, man. Can you hear it? - It's hollow. - Yeah.

This one's my favorite. Oh, God. Of course, it is. Why? Why? 'Cause she's naked? - Yeah. - They're all naked. No, she's not. I was there when they shot that. Excuse me? Those rocks, they're actually pretty dangerous. And one of the models, she fell off, - and I caught her. - Who are you? Maxwell, this is Terry Lam. Hey. You. Terry is Phil's best friend from college. - Oh! - I'm sure you got a lot of stories. Yeah, I guess. It's my wife, Victoria. So, you said the model fell off the rock and you caught her? - Yeah. - Wow. - She's a lucky girl. - Yeah. Well, your ex-roommate has a hell of an eye. Wow, that's a big compliment coming from you. So Maxwell is directing a remake of a Godard film. - Is that right? - Yeah. Hey, do you think Phil's that good? Good or not, he's got everything going for him right now, right? He's young, he's good looking, kind of a bad ass. Kind of? Oh, please, girls. Don't pretend like you don't love it. You guys like your guys broken so that you can fix 'em. I can't fix you. Well, by the time you figure that out, it's too late. Yeah. Hey, Terry, I wanna hear about you. What do you do? - I'm a film critic. - Oh, yeah? For magazines or newspapers? Well, a bit of both. Freelance, actually. Babe, Julian. Come on, we gotta talk to Julian. I have to go with him, he's stoned, but I'm gonna find you later. We're gonna talk more. I feel like we haven't seen much of you. Phil and I will go running couple mornings a week. Okay, I haven't seen you. Oh, you have been swamped. I was hoping maybe you'd fallen in love, maybe a lucky lady was taking up your time. I'm sorry to disappoint. Oh, what do you think? Beautiful. Yeah, these are the only ones I'd let him show. We've been quarrelling about it for weeks. I mean, he tried to break me down but I stayed strong. I'm not one of his models. Have you seen him? No, he's been mobbed since I got here. Hmm. - Catherine. - Ah, bonjour. How long have been in love with Catherine? Excuse me? I like to think I have a very pretty wife, would you agree? - Yeah, she's pretty. - Uh-huh. Well, you wouldn't know. You barely even looked at her. You wanted me to check out your wife? No. You didn't. That's my point. But she was flirting with you. She doesn't do that with everyone. But you wouldn't know. You were too busy staring at Catherine. I'm sorry. Hey, why'd she pick Phil over you anyway?

You quitting didn't help. I didn't quit. I just switched art forms. Mmm-hmm. I threw that feature against a brick wall for years. Nobody wanted it. Write another. Hey, what's up? Mmm, Texas.

I hurt you. - And we don't talk about that. - Catherine... I can walk away from that any time. You're different. Be my friend. We are friends. Mmm-mmm. A friend who's in love with me is a friend I don't know how to keep. You know I wouldn't share you with anyone. I know you wouldn't. Un-fucking-believable. She deserves better than you. You don't know half of what you think you know. Enlighten me. Catherine's the only girl I sleep with. What? I don't fuck other women. You fuck everybody. I haven't slept with anyone other than Catherine since college. - You expect me to believe that? - I don't care if you believe it or not, Terry. What about that model the other night? I orchestrated it. I orchestrated that. You know, not her coming in and going all ape-shit. That was a happy accident. But me telling that reporter we fucked, that was no drunken slip. She... She didn't deny it. Why would she? You know, people thinking that we did certainly doesn't hurt her career. Huh. But why? Look, if Catherine knew that I'm as big of a pussy as you, Terry, she would leave us both. We'd never see her again. Catherine, she's out there fucking other people 'cause she thinks that's what you're doing. Look, Catherine is doing exactly what she needs to do to feel free, okay? She needs us. I give her the bad boy that she'll never tame, and you give her this, you know, true unrequited love that she could feel wistful about on rainy days. You're out of your mind. I love Catherine just as much as you do, Terry. And you'll never understand her the way that I do. Come on. - Hello? - Hey. I have an idea for you. What kind of idea? Meet me in the morning. I'll tell you all about it. I'm supposed to go to Baltimore to see my dad. I'll come with you. Just meet me at dawn before you go. - What time is it? - I don't know. Will you meet me? - Sure. - Okay. - Hmm. - I have a movie. What do you mean? Okay. So the Z channel showed a double feature last night. Antonioni's L'Avventura and The Passenger, and I went to bed thinking about the woman who disappeared. - Yeah, Anna. - Yeah, yeah. And Jack Nicholson's stealing the arms dealer's identity and when I woke up, the idea was just sitting there fully-formed. Okay, so it's about a detective. He's not really a detective, but he's had to become one because the woman he loves has disappeared. So he follows her trail, and he finds out she's not who he thought she was. She travels from place to place, and takes on new identities, and sheds them like snakeskin. She leaves a trail of ruined men behind her. Was our detective one of them, or was their love something else, something real? He has to find out. All the while we're flashing back to their love story, watching their time unfold. I like this one. Well, I haven't even told you the twist. There is a hint of the occult. The detective meets an old man who recognizes the woman's photo, and breaks down at the sight of her, weeping. There's nothing sexier than a woman who knows her movies. Oh, uh, thank you. Yeah. You got yourself a real pretty girlfriend there. - Dad... - What? What is it that you do? I'm an actress. Figures you'd have an actress as a girlfriend. Well, she's not my girlfriend. - She's not your girlfriend? - No. What is she doing? She's just using you or something? Okay, stop. I think, uh... What? Look, I wanna come see you more often. What makes you think that I want you coming around here feeling sorry for me just because I'm alone? Huh? I don't need you to feel sorry for my ass. Good luck with your movie. Can't wait to see how it turns out. He's... He's been like this ever since my mom left. Sorry. So, what happens? With what? Us? No, the, uh, the old man and the detective. They... They're in love with the same woman, the old man recognizes her picture, and then what happens? Right. Um... Well, the old man tells the detective "This was the love of my life. "We spent a summer together in college." Mmm-hmm. And then she vanished without a trace. Is she flesh and blood, or... Is she something else? Is the old man confused, or... Is the woman he thought he knew so well, somehow ageless? Immortal? Let's write it. I'm not a writer. It's your idea. Okay, well, I'll help you work out the details, so when you go to write it, all the hard part's done. Run away with me. I love you, Terry. Let's go to California. I can't. We'll try to make your movie. Okay, you know that's not gonna happen. Stop, I'm serious. I want you to fuck me again. Yeah? I always felt his presence when the camera was rolling. Penetrating eyes. Very intense. And we shared these fleeting moments of intimacy on set. He held my hand once. I remember that. - I remember that, too. - Hmm. The day we shot the sex scene, he whispers in my ear, and he shows me exactly how wide he wants my mouth to be when I climax. He tells my makeup artist how flushed he wants my cheeks, and he tells my co-star how he should kiss me, how he should touch me, how hard he should pretend to fuck me... - She's exaggerating. - No, I'm not. Jesus, that's kinky, Maxwell. Look, all directors fall in love. Lust. Fall in love with their leading ladies. And sometimes, it's just electric. Like with Godard and Anna Karina, and Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, - And Diane Keaton. - Yeah, exactly. Roberto Rossellini, Ingrid Bergman. Ingmar Bergman and every actress he ever worked with... Okay, enough. Stop. That night, after we wrap, I go back to the hotel, and I try to fall asleep, but it won't come. And I toss and I turn, but I can't get Maxwell's voice out of my head. I'm trapped in this Bruce Springsteen song. I'm on fire. I end up walking down the hall, and knocking on his door at 1:00 a.m. And he's there half asleep, his hair is all messy, and he looks at me like he thought he was still dreaming. I still do. ♪ Dead in Denver, drowsy Idaho ♪ Just dreams away from your love, San Francisco ♪ Hey. You got an extra cigarette? Sure. Thank you. So, you're Phil's friend, Terry, right? I am. Terry Lam. - That was quite a story. - Yeah. Maxwell loves it when I tell that story in public. His ego has no ceiling. So, you're Terry Lam like the film critic? Guilty. Wow. You wrote the most beautiful thing about me. - I did. - You did, yeah. You said, um... You said my face was like an altar that men worship at, "but it's her fearless performances "that assure her place in cinema history." I cannot believe that you read that. I did. I read all of them.

I tried to get Maxwell to do it once, but he made me feel really silly about it. Do you wanna try? Yeah. Okay. You know, Catherine speaks really highly of you. - Does she? - Hmm. Yeah. She says you're the kindest and gentlest person that she's ever known. - She said I was gentle? - Yeah. And she told me your dream was to be a filmmaker. And she told me about your script. I would love to read it when it's done. - Really? - Yeah, it sounds like a great story. It was all Catherine's idea. - She gives you all the credit. - Hmm. Is she in love with you? Her and Phil have been dating since college. So? I mean, most people who're in relationships are in love with somebody else. We're just friends. I don't have the luxury of taking things slow, Terry.

So, let's talk about The Pretender. Terry, I've read thousands of scripts. Phew! And it's rare to read something of this quality, especially written by someone no one's ever heard of before.

I will have the director take you under his wing, teach you the ropes. If the movie hits, you'll write your next one to direct. I'll make that happen. You have my word on that. - Deal? - Yes, sir. - All right. Cheers. - Cheers. Hey, thank Vicky, 'cause I don't make deals like that. - Mmm-mmm. - Ever. Oh, shit. Ron. - I'm sorry. - Oh, hi. Hey, come here. Are you okay with this? You have no idea what this means to me. Stop it. You're a beautiful writer. I should be thanking you. You can thank me later. Yeah? I'll thank you as many times as you like. Hmm. Hey. I have another surprise. What? I asked Maxwell for a divorce. Terry, I'm worried about Catherine, man. What do you mean? She hasn't been the same the last few months ever since you started seeing Victoria. What am I supposed to do about it? You're the one who's supposed to make her happy. I mean, but I don't do that on my own, Terry. You balance things out. I'm not interested in balancing things out. It's my turn to be happy. I've got a shoot in an hour, man. Everyone, thank you so much for coming tonight to celebrate our engagement. I promise I'll keep this short. Kurt Vonnegut said, "Love is where you find it, "and I think it's foolish to go around looking for it." I wasn't looking for love when I met Terry, but that's exactly where I found it. And I have Terry's closest friends to thank for that. Catherine and Phil, they introduced us. Thank you so much! That's good. Thank you. Hey. Hey. It's for you. What's that? Warners optioned the script. This is your half. It's not much. There'll be more when it goes into production. I don't want that. I didn't write it. You deserve it. Every cent. If there wasn't for you, there wouldn't be a movie. Okay, fine. Thank you. So when's the wedding? It's next summer. How much have you had to drink? Not nearly enough. Why are you acting like this? - Are you mad at me? - No. No. I'm mad at myself. Um... Tell Phil that I took a cab home. Congratulations. Uh, whatever she's having. Leave it. I'll use hers. - I've gotta go. - No. I wish you'd take me with you. I want to meet your father and your grandmother. - Yeah, you say that now. - I'm serious. I can't meet them for the first time on our wedding day. - Another weekend. - Soon? - Soon. - Soon? - Now, I've gotta go if I'm gonna beat traffic. - How soon? No, stay with me. All right. Bye. What are you doing here? Wanna get into bed? Now you want me? Please? I'm with Victoria. Then why are you here? I wanna pretend like it's... The night we spent here together. We made love and you asked me a question, remember? No. Catherine. You asked me to be with you. And I think I can be that person for you now. I don't know... who else I wanna be. I just... Please ask me. Please? Will you be with me? Yes. I'm sorry. You used me. I didn't. I care about you. I... I didn't think that she and I would... "Friends." "Just friends." That's what you told me you were. - We were. - I knew it. I knew. I knew there was something between you. I just didn't... I had... I had it all backwards. How long have you been in love with her? Does that really matter? Is... Is that how you felt when you asked me to marry you? Just leave! Leave! Get the fuck out of my house! Leave! Leave. - Just get out! - I'm sorry. You can say that as many times as you like. - I'm sorry. - Get out! Get out! Please, Terry, get... Just get out of my house! You know, I've worked with some really great actors, Terry. But you are by far the best! God, I hope she's worth it! Well played, Terry. Seriously, I couldn't orchestrate it any better myself. Yeah. Well, I learned from the best. Yeah, maybe now you can be the guy that she feels wistful about on rainy days. You know what? You're right. You're right. You're right. It's my turn to be unhappy. You deserve it. So savor it, 'cause you will be back on this side of the table. Yeah, we'll see about that. Oh, you will. And then I will, and we'll continue to throw her back and forth like this for the rest of our lives. We're moving to L.A. We leave in a week. What? Hey.

Yeah, it is. I killed you. Don't say that again, okay? Don't think it. You realized how much you love Terry. I love you, too. Not like him. And you didn't do anything wrong. What happened after this... That's all on me. Bad luck. Bad decisions. Here. Phil. Phil. Where... Where is Catherine? - What? - She took all of her things. I think she's gone. Okay, so Texas... Is that where you think she went? Uh, maybe. Everything's been arranged. You, Catherine, my parents, y'all will be fine. I don't want your money. I know where Catherine is. She took one of my credit cards when she was leaving. - She bought a plane ticket to London. - London? She was always an enigma. And what better way for our story to end than for her to simply vanish into thin air? Terry. I'm fucking scared, man. Really fucking scared. Phil. Phil. Hey. Phil. ♪ From my view at 32nd Street ♪ Winter throws its snow down heavily ♪ Empty halls of friends who've come and gone Hello? ♪ I'm awoken, rushed and dragged along ♪ The first show is not for an hour. I'm looking for someone. It's a woman. Can I show you her picture? What's your name? - Do you know this woman? - I asked you a question. I'm Terry Lam. I'm an American. So is the woman in the photo. She's my girlfriend. Her name's Catherine. We live in Los Angeles together. - But see, she's missing. - I can't help you. Why? Because she's running from something. Probably you. Sir, please. It's our friend. He got sick and died. I don't think she could handle it. So she ran. - Do you love her? - More than anything. I've gotta find her. Well... Her name is not Catherine. And she's definitely not American. What? How do you know that? Because I've known Claire since she was this tall. And she used to sit over there. Claire? Claire. That's her name. Claire Warrick. In the summer, her mother would buy her tickets for the whole day, then leave her here while she... She worked. During the school year, Claire would arrive in the afternoon, and stay through the last show. She watched hundreds of movies, and loved every one of them. Her mother always picked her up. She was never late, until that night. I didn't know she was a whore. Claire ran away from every foster home they stuck her in, and she always ended up back here in my theater. Then eventually, believe it or not, they suggested I keep her. Years passed, and we never, never spoke about her mother. Then she met a boy called Paul. I didn't think much of him. And on her 16th birthday, they ran away together to America. Paul returned alone three months later. He woke up one morning, she was gone, and he was devastated. A month ago, she shows up, and she hasn't changed a lick. She's lived in America for years, but she still has the perfect British accent and the mannerisms, the way she phrases things, all intact. It wasn't until she was gone and the spell was broken that I realized that what she'd done to me was an act of kindness. She pretended to be the girl I remembered. She said she was going to be in a play. I lent her some money. I didn't believe it when she said she'd repay it. I couldn't care less. But she sent part of what she owed last week. No note inside, just French currency. Thank you. Son... I let Claire go a long time ago. It seems to me it would be for the best if you were to let this Catherine go, too. I can't. She's the only person in the world that really knows who I am. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine! Who... May I help you? I wanna talk to her. Catherine. She says she doesn't know you. She doesn't know me? No, and she doesn't speak English. What? Okay. All right. Translate. Catherine, I went to London. I met Henry. I know everything. I don't care who you are. 'cause I love you and I want you to come home with me. Uh... She says you have her confused with someone else. This is Christine Vespal. Please, I think you should leave. Phil died. He wanted me to tell you that he loves you very much. Catherine. - Hey, Catherine. - Please, go! - Catherine! - I don't want to have to call the police. Catherine! I apologize. Must be confused.
