THE FIRST MURDER Where are you going? Where are you going? What's so funny? Maybe my hairstyle. Or my voice trembled. It's my fault. I shouldn't have replied. You are scared? I'm not. Can you row? I used to. I don't think I've forgotten. Will you have the strength? Give me the oar. Give it to me! I shouldn't have left. Maybe she's insane. I'd be a jerk if I gave up on a girl. Especially a pretty one like her. It's better if she's insane. She looks like an actress. Maybe she is one. I've never met a funnier creature than you. Nor such a strong young man. My name's Mansil and don't laugh! Okay, Mansil. I won't laugh. Don't break the oar. Push near the sand. Near the sand. Give me the oar! Since you can't do two things at once. Rowing and talking. We're in no hurry. Since we're here, then, let's talk. If only I could talk like Zobec. To impress her. Time goes by and I keep quiet like... an idiot. What would Zobec come up with now? Say something. Why are you quiet? Speak up! What do I care? If only Zobec could hear me. I'd like to kiss your knee. If you don't mind. Go ahead. Don't you like the right one? I do! No! Not now. We'll drop anchor now. To stretch our legs a bit. I'm so lucky. She's the prettiest girl I've ever met. The most natural. I'm almost better than Zobec. Thanks to luck only, but not on merit. It'd be nice... if I told her how lonesome I am. She's surely lonesome. You're always on the river. Not always. If I fancy another place more, the river waits for me till the next day. Good friends have a lot of patience. Me too. I'm waiting... for permission for one more kiss, on your right knee. I'm such an idiot. Does that really matter? Why should that be the most important thing? - Forgive me. I didn't mean to bring it up at all. It doesn't really matter to me. I only wanted... to tell you... how much I like you. Do tell me. What would Zobec do now? My loneliness is awfully great. I was dreaming of meeting someone like you. If I could say what I feel she'd be fascinated. I've been waiting for years to meet someone, to tell her... Now, I can't. Don't laugh. In that world... In that world... there is... a stranger called Zobec. I don't know him either. All I know is... that he's such a great entertainer. He's almost 10, 20 years older than me. He'd be disappointing at first sight. He's got a big head. Long hair. Funny, ugly face. He's very serious. I saw him at a party where I was with my buddies. Nobody knows how he turned up there. He was sitting on the floor all the time in front of three girls... who are ill at ease in male company. I mean... My buddies. I don't know what he was telling them. They were laughing. So much so that at the end... they had to be quietened down. At the end, he didn't need... to say anything at all. He burst into laughter. You see... You see, in that Zobec guy who is so educated and so skilful I see the man who... I'd like to be. Don't you like how you look, Mansil? Your name's Mansil. Why are you confusing me? You do that all the time. Sorry if talking about Zobec was unnecessary. You're right: no room for other people. You always ruin everything! - What shall I do, then? Act naturally. - I act natural. You don't! - I do! You don't! - I do! - You don't! What would Zobec do? He'd find a way out for sure. What has he learned in 10 20 years? Why are we leaving if we had fun? - Because! You're taking me to another place? - I'm taking you home. Your place? - No, yours. Why are we leaving? Maybe we'll find out someday. - Won't we meet again? We won't. - Why not? You don't like me? - Quite the contrary. I'm fond of you. What's stopping us, then? We'll find out someday. - What would Zobec do? He'd surely find the best solution. A solution or a mistake, at least. I held her tight. I kissed her on her cheek, her neck... Her lips. She didn't notice me. I did all I had to. I must've made a mistake somewhere. But where? Even if I were a magician, I wouldn't be able to correct the mistake. Did I offend you somehow? - Don't ask questions. You're a good boy. If you ever look for answers to this day it's all because you're such a good boy. Can I kiss your right knee? Your left knee? What would Zobec do? Who knows? Telling her "I don't want to leave you" won't do any good. I'd offend her once again. She thinks... that I'm a good boy. One more thing. Did you at least love me there? I'm not telling you! What shall I do now? What now? Tomorrow, I'll forget her face. I kept looking at her all this time so that I nearly went blind. Give me the oar. Please, tell me what would you do if you were with a girl you like? The girl you like. What would you do? What would you do? What would you do?
