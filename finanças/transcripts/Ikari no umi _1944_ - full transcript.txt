Censored by the Navy Department No.48 Toho The Cruel Sea People's movie recommended by Information Bureau The Cruel Sea Director: Imai Tadashi English Subtitles: Maya Grohn Taisho 10 (1922) Gogai (extra news)! Washington Naval Disarmament Conference, a bomb-like proposal by the US. The Department of the Navy On November 12th, at the Washington Conference, Secretary of State Hughes, the Envoy Extraordinary, proposed disarmament. Of which I now detail the article on the disposal of ships. Under the released 4 principals, the capital ships which shall be disposed are; The United States of America, 1) 15 capital ships under construction, 2) 15 aged battleships except Delaware and North Dakota. Britain, 1) 2 ships of new Hood class which have started construction but the cost was expended. 2) The first battleship except King George V class, and 19 aged battleships. Japan, 1) Battleships Kii, Owari, No. 11, No. 12 which have not begun construction, and cruisers No. 8, No. 9, No. 10, and No. 11. Eight ships in total. 2) Battleship Mutsu, which has launched, as well as Tosa and Kaga still under construction, plus battlecruisers Amagi, Akagi, Atago, and Takao which have not begun construction. This is Tosa, which has just completed. This must be destroyed? What an agreement it is! Chief Takenaka, what do you think the outcome of the conference? Do you think they will reach the agreement? I don't want. I don't want the agreement, but, But? But, what will it be? Public opinion, Watch the newspaper. People are just curious if only Mutsu can be saved or not. Unfortunately I can't hold any wishful thought. What is this design? The increased tonnage necessitated this size. This level was reached by the US. We need higher level, beyond them. We are designing battleships No. 11 and No. 12 for the Imperial Navy. You know it. You must have plenty of ideas in your fine brain which are not used. Use them generously. Try again. Chief, What will Washington Conference be? The US demanding to dispose the battleships No. 11 and 12. What is it to do with your job? What are you thinking during working? With such mindset no good design can be created. But chief, We have been working hard with an expectation that, new capital ships such as Nagato, Kaga, Tosa, Akagi will roam the Pacific Ocean to protect Japan. Nevertheless, our previous shipbuilding plan now... Yamagishi, The shipbuilding plan was, determined by Your Highness. Our duty of shipbuilding officers should focus on producing ships, simple as that. Sacrifice of Washington Agreement Destruction of ships were performed lwami sank in Jogashima Satsuma sank in Sagaminada Then, Aki 12,000 sailors left their positions. Yoshino Disgusting. Look at the people of shaba (the world other than navy) like that. Don't say. Shaba. I also have to join the wind of shaba now. Drink. Let's drink knight. Yes, drink a lot. Yes, drink a lot. You haven't seen yet, naked dance by Miyamori. Yes, he paints a face on his belly. OK, I don't show it often but tonight I will do for Yoshino. OK, I don't show it often but tonight I will do for Yoshino. What's wrong? Before that I want to say farewell to Excellency Kato. To Excellency? I see. In this occasion, that's good idea. You can get a strong power from Excellency. Let's go together. The Tokyo Peace Exhibition Ueno Park Tokyo March 10 to July 10, 1922 Excellency, I accept my leaving from the navy. However, what I can't stand is the attitude of the people. The American people are incited by their government and exciting with them-- I can understand that. But Japanese people also, manipulated by the beautiful words, peace and happiness, and took the side of US. and took the side of US. What will be the future of Japan like this? We lost in the conference, that is because we could not get enough support of the people. I believe so, sir. You have put your whole heart and soul into the construction of battleships, Admiral. People are ignorant how much we owe you. Yoshino, Battleships are decreased but, the spirit of the Navy would never be decreased. Admiral Togo himself consoled me so. Furthermore, the capital ships are restricted but the training are not. He added so. That is the spirit. Hiraga-sama is visiting sir. Please. Am I not disturbing you? No, no. They are strong-headed guys of Naval Academy. He is the chief of Yokosuka factory. Yes, he took care of us when we visiting the factory for our study. Thank you very much for the occasion sir. Then we take leave sir. Please take care of you sir. Yoshino, Did you decide what to do after this? I see. All right. After you take a good rest in hot spring of your hometown, visit me again. There are countless ways to use a man. Don't be depressed. Yes sir. Excuse me sir. Hiraga-kun, Have a seat. Admiral, you look thinner. I understand your concern sir. No. I have no excuse to you all. It was beyond our capacity. What are you saying sir? About the plan of 8-8 fleet, we demanded or forced you unreasonably. Many reckless things. But you accepted our unreasonable demands and fulfilled our expectation so well. The excellent battleships were the result of your painstaking efforts. And now, we must destroy them helplessly. Admiral, your words are enough sir. Our science and technology have no limit. The challenge starts now. Please, Hiraga-kun. Do it. If the capital ships are limited, then cruisers can compensate for them. If they limit quantity, we respond with quality. Hiraga-kun, We shall fight. I believe that war has started already. America. Our enemy is America. They appeared clearly over the ocean. Notice: Before the demolishing work, the ceremony for ship disposal will be performed on the deck of Tosa, May 19th, General Affairs Dept., March 16, 1922. It was about to show the figure in the Pacific Ocean, when the stoppage of the ship building became unavoidable, and today we are facing the day of valuable experiment by the Imperial Navy, accordingly the ship will be ended honorably in the deep sea bottom outside the Yokosuka. We will not be able to see the brave figure, nevertheless the age of the warship will remain forever... We will not be able to see the brave figure, nevertheless the age of the warship will remain forever... Come in. Tosa's memento sir. Check the cruiser Yura's ship hull. What is your behavior? Yamagishi-kun, calculate this. Now sir? Now, immediately. I can't do sir. What? Yamagishi, Our duty was not ended by making Tosa and Kaga alone. I understand that sir. But, in that, in Tosa, our soul was kept. But, in that, in Tosa, our soul was kept. When we designed Tosa, we put all our hearts and souls into it. We can't forget, never. For the past three years, day and night, we worked so hard, keenly checked even a rivet or steel plate. The ship was made on such efforts and sincerity. We loved the ship like as our child. Takenaka-san, don't you think so? Don't you think so, all of you? The ship is now sinking by our Navy's torpedoes and cannons. Chief, Ask yourself, I'm sure you can't listen it unmoved. Showa 2 (1927) What is that...? The first submarine squadron sir. Don't do half-way drilling. Tell the first engine, go into it. Officer Asaka, What is that? The first squadron sir. Good. Go. Danger sir, starboard, How about airplane? Can't fly? Commander, in this bad weather... If this is real war... Sir, airplane can fly. Chief, that is wrong way sir. Chief, He is thinking something. Long time no see sir. An experiment today sir? I heard you are on board of destroyer these days. Yes sir. In the last training, he and I was fighting each other. So, you are doing intensive training of airplanes. Yes sir, about the airplanes we are behind of US. Training the first and training the second. He is especially eager. That's you. Thank you for your hard work. You must have hard work in the ship headquarters, Admiral. How is the progress of cruisers? Did you know it? Yes, I am thinking of small-sized yet higher power. Small but can challenge against enemy ships much larger. Oh, it sounds Leica in terms of camera. Leica? Maybe. I can't wait being on board. But it is not comfortable to ride. It is a battleship in principle. We are used to live in small house. It seems like to clash against enemy. Done. 22:33, we ordered to return immediately but, no answer sir. How about fuel? Five minutes to go. Flying Officer Sawai Crashed to Death during drilling in stormy weather Mitsuko-san, It is so late. But father is still awake, so, Your piano might be disturbing him. I am consoling him. Music is very good when you are tired. No, not for father. Your tea is ready there. Did children go to bed? Koichi and Mitsuko are not. Koichi has the end of term examination soon. Yes. He said he will study tonight until you go to sleep. Means I am his keeping awake. Mitsuko's piano is improved, isn't it? Did you notice it? Yes, I can notice. Like you she is eager to learn. I will change your tea. No. I told you. We can't change the demanded figures. But, considering the speed... Of course 33 knots is fixed. One is satisfied but the other is not. That is not a challenge. Our target is, satisfy this and that, both. Do it again, the length of the ship. The speed is fixed. You can do it. On my design it is longer than conventional ship. That's up to your invention. If you use conventional principles, we cannot create new design. Anyway, try again. The speed is more than 30 knots. If you designed longer one, the ship will be crushed by waves before shooting enemy. The strength of the hull is critical. Considering the resistance against waves, try again. I do sir. How was the experiment Yamagishi-kun? Perfectly, failed, perfectly. The center of balance is too high in the type. Unbalanced? More than unbalanced. If it makes abrupt turn, the hull inclines to much like this, the shooting of torpedoes is put of question. I have no face. The chief said it was impossible but I insisted. Impossible. We want a 3,000 ton ship having the power of 5,000 ton one. How about yours? Likewise. I am at the end of my resources. Failed again. I have to make a fresh start. Same fall evening everywhere (famous poem). I wish a good idea coming. The dead-end is a matter of course. I think the changing shape of ship does not work. Engine. The key is engine, definitely. We are planning to produce a cruiser of less than 3,000 tons which can compete with the speed, firepower, and armor of 5,000 ton ships such as Britain's "C"-class and America's "Omaha"-class. It may sound outrageous from the point of conventional knowledge of hull. But I believe it is feasible. The ground of my discussion is; the ratio of hull weight against displacement is 35% in destroyer and battleship respectively, meanwhile, cruiser is 45% , that is, 10% bigger. If this is improved, we can economize the weight to this level. Next, the important element which has significant influence on displacement is, engine. In this point also, the cruiser's engine weight occupies far bigger percentage than the one of the destroyer in order to get the speed of a destroyer. This doesn't make sense. Wait. Well, no. I should listen your conclusion first. Conclusion is simple. How to economize displacement without decreasing attacking capacity? I believe the solution can be found in hull and engine. I see. How about technological development for the hull? What is it's progress? Well, unfortunately, we have no clear prospect yet. One more step to go. But, the engine itself cannot become lighter. Why? Needless to say we are working hard to make an engine which is more efficient with minimum weight. However, the engine of cruiser can be the same as destroyer in terms of speed. But in terms of fighting capacity, it must be strong enough to defend the enemy's attack. For protecting the engine, it can be compensated with the structure of hull and traffic-ability. No, it's not only the protection against enemy's shells. To keep the cruising power and durability, we can't make the engine lesser ratio as same as destroyer's. It is not possible by conventional design technology, of course. We are making our best with full of ideas. But this is impossible. If you demand that it shouldn't be heavier than conventional one, we can do it. I request you again from a designer of engine. The engine of cruiser needs the conventional ratio, that should be kept like as standard of main gun and other weapons. We cannot change it, definitely. Consider it please. No, I can't. I can't accept it. I can't agree either. That's butting-in. I can't agree with you either. We can't help it. It's a difference of belief. Belief? Yes sir. Takagi-san, I can't abandon my belief and responsibility on the design. I also take the responsibility for the fundamental design. However, impossible is impossible. Make the impossible possible. your belief must keep in it. Hiraga-san, that is the butting-in. I don't care. Takagi-san, This is not the time of discussion. Rightly or wrongly we must make a test ship to run on the sea, a day sooner. Just as that. Don't you agree? According to Takagi-kun's opinion, decreasing the weight of engine may be not feasible. It means everything simply depends on the structure of hull which we have been trying to invent. I know very well that your mission is extremely difficult. However, coming to this stage, it is not logic but implementation. You must solve the problem by your experience and determination. There is no other way. I believe that your passion and sincerity can find a way. Chief, did Excellency Takagi say clearly that decreasing the engine weight is impossible? We are working for making the impossible possible, so I think the people in designing of engine must determine as we do. That's true. Are you the shipbuilding officers of the Imperial Navy? Can't you attack the enemy without covering fire? Can't you crash yourself against the enemy ship before our airplane make suicide attack? In the sky and the sea, valuable lives were lost during the hard training of the Navy. What do you think about the hard training? Your impious talk shows that you have no determination to dedicate your life to the country. Chief. No. I didn't ask you. I will do by myself. Takenaka-san, didn't mind too much. As a matter of fact, he scolded me. Because I added ''That's true''. My mistake. No, to was not. I was told clearly that I lack the belief. I was beaten up by his word. Stupid. Father is in bad mood. He must be tired. Dinner is ready. Father, chrysanthemum does not bloom well this year. Pull out, if not blooming. Can I, father? All right. Tadahiko-san, you are early as usual, sensei. Boy, Morning. Morning. Good boy. These days he wakes me up. Keep in. Good ship. Here it goes. Came. Came again. Sensei, how about your chrysanthemum this year? Good. Bye. Good morning sir. Persuade father? Do you oppose? Not at all. But no hope. I am confident. What are you talking about? Michiko said, she would bring father to today's concert. No, he will never go. But mother,I worry father's health. He is working too hard. Yes, I am worrying very much. Would you like to eat? Yes, I am hungry. Father, Here you are. Have you made this? Looks warm. Do you want a reward? Yes. Ask mother. No, I want from you, father. But father is too busy to shop. But give me only two to three hours today. Please. Where to? Concert. Concert? Father, You would never regret. No way. But father, it is full orchestra, more than 100 performers. With full instruments we can enjoy very complicated harmony A conductor will harmonize all of them into a piece of music. If the conductor is not good, he can't harmonize the individual performance, so, any splendid composition will lose the soul. Father Father feels better with job than music. O, Yagi-kun. Call all. Tell them, come immediately. O, Yagi-kun. Call all. Tell them, come immediately. Yes sir. You are here too. Thank you. You are working on Sunday You too. Takagi-san, I got an idea this morning. Me too. When I was playing with child, I got an idea. I see. As aging we become impatience. You are right. By the way, I think I will get a solution. To tell you the truth, Me too. The engine. Maybe I can satisfy your demand. That's because, wait listen me first. What do you think? I arranged like this. The shape is like katsuo-bushi (dried bonito). Looks like old Kinsho-type. Over the bow area which is to be covered by waves, should be made high as possible like this, Over the bow area which is to be covered by waves, should be made high as possible like this, and the place of engine part should be kept at this height considering the stability for hull inclination And over the stern, make it as lowest as possible just enough to avoid waves. That is, the upper deck plots three curve lines like this. In this way, a crash of ship can be avoided even if it goes out significantly. The second purpose is that, the armor plates on the ship's side which are used simply for protection against attack, change them so they add strength of structure of the hull. For example, I see. To save weight, make lightening holes as much as possible. That is my planning. I didn't come to the point. Chief, not just my instinct, this will work finally. This is not instinct. I am confident. Excuse me sir. Yamagishi-kun, let's make our jobs assigned. Yagi-kun, Takenaka-kun has not come yet? He went out for waling. We don't know when he will come back. Should I call him again? Maybe not. He seemed very tired. Sorry I am late sir. I have explained the issue to all. You can listen from them. Wonderful. We will make the best ship in the world. Thus, cruiser Yubari, trial ship No. 1 , was completed. Next was Kako, an enlarged and improved Yubari. Then, Furutaka, Kinugasa and Aoba. Myoko, Nachi, Ashigara and Haguro, 10,000 tons class New cruisers completed successively that surprised the powerful nations' navies. Heaven Rank Fuso Autumn By Hiraga Yuzuru How wonderful it is! Hiraga-sama has a talent of growing of chrysanthemums too. Father, I found, there. Hello, Asaka-kun. Long time no see sir. Likewise. I heard you moved to gunrei-bu (Imperial Navy General Staff). Yes sir. Back to land life after long. Asaka-san of gunrei-bu. How do you do? Admiral, I got a wife. Did you? Good. Congratulation. Nice to meet you sir. Admiral, I will go to the London Conference as an attendant. Oh, you are? It seems they were frightened by the quality of our cruisers. But we have determined. We would never surrender to their demands who try to control your painstaking crystal results as they wish. Please. However, Asaka-kun you don’t need to care of us, shipbuilding officers. If they disturb us, then we will find new ideas. Oh no. We forgot your lovely wife. Showa 5 (1930), the US and the UK forced us again to cut the auxiliary vessels to be 60% of US and UK's. Are you all right, Yagi? I am all right. Thank you. What's the matter? No, nothing sir. Didn't you know Yagi-kun was sick? We urged him frequently to take rest. I am all right. This is nothing. Chief, the Imperial Navy is bound hand and foot firmly now. First they restricted capital ships and aircraft carriers, and now, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, all of them restricted. We, we must find a way out. Chief, I am still workable. Please. Attendant Asaka, killed himself by sword in the returning ship Excuse me sir. Aren't you Admiral Hiraga? Yes I am Hiraga. You didn't remember me. Ten years since then. It was after the Washington Conference. We met in the hospital room of Admiral Kato. Asaka was there too. Oh, you are the friend of Asaka-san. I am Yoshino. I see. How have you been? I was in Continent. I haven't served well. Just moving here and there. I could not meet Asaka again. Asaka, Nippon stood up, thank to you. We get over the push of US and UK. We liberated Manchuria. The Imperial Navy is invincible. Admiral, I saw Yubari in Shanghai. You saw Yubari? The foreigners were astonished by her mighty figure. I was so impressed that I shed tears. When I saw Japanese warship in foreign country, I felt joy and proud. All the Japanese in abroad feel so. Please make new ships as many as possible. The Level of Navy staff now is better and better. I am sure they do well after I retire. Retirement? I decided to leave the Navy. Admiral Hiraga was invited by Tokyo Imperial University to become head of the Engineering School. Shifting from creating battleships to creating battleship engineers. Showa 16 (1941) Can't we submit the agenda in the meeting today on establishment of the Chiba Institute of Technology? Almost ready sir. But, it is very important issue so we need to check it again. It is important, that's why we need to hurry. The sooner the better for the significance of the university. To establish the second engineering school is most urgent issue. Do not forget it. Then we will submit the agenda to the Administrative Council today sir. Do it. Something else? Sir, I think you'd better to get a doctor's check when you have a time. I am not sick person. But since your last disease, It was cured completely. And look at these schedules. Today, tomorrow, and after tomorrow, no time to see doctor. you have a visitor sir. O, rare visitor. Let him in. Excuse me sir. Please. Long time no see sir. I know you are busy but, No, no, please. You look fatigued. I have some news. Admiral, You know Yoshino, He died recently. Dead? Where? In Malay sir. He was arrested for the suspicion of spying. He was released but terribly weakened. He could not resist strong malaria anymore. We lost a good man. I see. When he realized the death was coming, he gave me his will. Together with this handbook. He observed many foreign warships and noted his opinions. Of course, it is not useful to you but, if your Excellency reads this he would be happy. Yoshino admired you, Admiral. Thank you. I will read. I will bring Yoshino with me. Asaka, and Sawai, who died by plane too. I will bring them for the next sailing. Maybe I will change my address to living among the dead. I see. The members of the meeting are gathered sir. I sincerely pray the fortune of war. Please take care of yourself, Admiral. Thank you. Destroyed 4 enemy aircraft carriers, a gunboat, 3 cruisers, and a destroyer with 200 airplanes shot down. Our losses were one cruiser and one destroyer slightly damaged. 15 airplanes. That was the report from Headquarters at 15:00. Why don't you lie down, dear? Sensei, please be relaxed. I am all right. I am not so sick. Put off hapri gown and lie down. No, no, I sit a little more. Sensei, We repeat again sir. We hope you take a rest during the entrance ceremony sir. I can't believe but, isn't it a decision of Administrative Council? No sir, your followers are worrying... Don't worry. I know my body. you have experienced the same. The entrance ceremony is the time to refresh the students' determination, for stepping out on a new way in life. It is important ceremony. No. I don't allow someone reading my address on my behalf. You heard the radio news. How the head of students can lie down peacefully. Take the box. I want to listen myself. Read... Sensei, this is the congratulatory address for the entrance ceremony. Yes. Read it. Freshmen, today you enter the highest academic institution of Imperial Japan shouldering the expectation of the nation and the hope of your family clans. It is true that you have attained this honor by your given talent and your hard study for years. nevertheless it was nothing but a blessing of the magnificent imperial reign. Today, Japanese empire is in a great war for all or nothing, against the two most powerful enemies in the world. You can concentrate on your studies peacefully thanks to this enormous blessings, to which you owe a great debt of gratitude. In addition, when you consider the love of your parents, which poured over you in your character building for twenty years or so, that is higher than mountain and deeper than ocean, you are overwhelmed by gratitude beyond description. The duty of a student in Imperial Japan, is to serve the Divine Nation by his intelligence and science. True creativeness or true originality results from a sincere nature to risk your own life for the national emergency and to exert oneself to the utmost for the eternal Imperial Nation. Do not forget your duty as a student and prepare that whenever, where ever you are called, you must go to the front bravely and die for Imperial Japan... at the same time you must be level-headed and keep studying calmly. He was awake a while ago, but he is so weakened. We will wait till he wakes up. Takenaka-sama is here. Let him in. I’m sorry sir. I've been wanting to visit you for some time. Thank you. How are you all doing? Yes sir, we have been working hard. I have been pleased that you are making a number of excellent ships. Yamagishi-kun, Do you remember? When the Tosa was destroyed. How we cried. The spirit. If you don't lose the spirit, Japanese Navy will be stronger and become invincible. I envy you. We came to ask you something sir. Chief, you are irreplaceable person. Are you asking me to leave my post and take a rest? Thank you for your consideration. Please. Under the circumstances, take a rest until you can recover a little, sir. Under the circumstances, I can't quit. But, sensei, In the front as well as home front, people are united for working. Everyone is fighting seriously. As long as I am usable, I cannot quit. Even if this is the last service. Taorete-nochi-yamu (Stop only when I am dead.) I can fight. Still more. The Cruel Sea END
