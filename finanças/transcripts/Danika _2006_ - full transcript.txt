[piano music] [Danika] I'm gonna be okay. I'm going to be okay. I'm fine. I'm going to be okay. I'm gonna be okay. I'm going to be okay. I'm fine. [muffled voice] I'm gonna be fine now. [theme music] [children's laughter] [Randy] Hey, baby. How are you? [Danika] Stressed. What else is new? [Randy] I know. Me, too. It's crazy here. Listen, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight. Why, what happened? It's the Hansen's. They pushed the goddamn meeting again. I have to close this deal. Oh, Randy. That's the third time this week. I know. I'll make it up to you. I promise. Okay. Are you sure? 'Cause I can cancel this. Are you sure? Yep. [tires screech] [Danika screams] Oh, my God. Danika! [thundering] [Randy] What happened? Randy? What? Hold on. Hold on. What's going on? No, no. Someone was just... It's okay. Forget it. It was just, just scary. Okay. I love you. You just have a good meeting, alright? [male radio newscaster] I hope you're keeping dry on this bizarre rainy afternoon. Unfortunately, we have some sad news to relate from the WRNN news desk. The body of an eight-year-old girl was found today in a soccer field two miles from her home. The police have officially identified her as the missing Lizzie Geralds... [radio stops] Hi. You waiting for somebody? Where are your parents? They're coming to pick you up? Well, there you are. Come on, Lizzie. Let's go. [murmuring] Good afternoon, Danika. Hi. Can I please see you in my office? Of course. [sniffs and clears throat] [knocking at the door] Come in. Close the door. Please, have a seat. I know I'm late. I didn't think it would take that long. Just 15 minutes. I had to drop my daughter off at her piano lesson. Did you hear about the little girl who was missing? They found her body. What does that have to do with anything? Okay. It won't happen again. It's not just the lateness, Danika. We have a problem. Your calculations are off again. No. You're kidding me. The figures are what the figures say. You are wrong. I don't... I'm very, very sorry. I'll call the security board and discuss it. [telephone rings] Yeah. Uh-huh. I'll be right there. Okay. You get on the phone and work this out with them. I want this settled by the end of the day. By the end of today? Yes. Okay. I'll have it settled. And don't bother them with the papers. Just use my office. I'll see you later. Alright. You all have a good day. [bang] [thief #1] Down! Don't look at me. Put the money in the bag. [muffled screams] [thief #2] Freeze! [thief #1] Down on the floor. Now. [thief #1] Alright, nobody moves. You gonna do... [thief # 2] Nobody moves! [people screaming] [thief #1] Don't look at me. Or you're gonna get hurt! [alarm goes off] We're fucked! Who's in charge in here? Huh? Huh? [thief #1] Who's in charge? [Patricia] I am. Please. Please, calm down. Where's the monitor system? Where's the monitor system? Huh? [thief #1] Come on! [cries in pain] Where the fuck is the monitor system? [thief #1] Where is it, bitch? In there. In the office. Go. [bang] Danika? Danika, are you okay? Are you alright? What's wrong with you? [soft music] [opens cars door] Randy? Brian? [thump] Lauren? [thump] [everybody] Surprise! [Ryan] Happy birthday! [Danika laughs] I forgot it was my birthday. I forgot. You forgot? I forgot it was my birthday. Like the cake? Oh, I love it! I made it. I helped, too. [Lauren] I got you a scarf, Mommy. It's over there. Kurt and I got you a gift certificate. What is it for? [Kurt] It's a gift certificate to some spa. [Ryan] Nice. Subtle. Happy birthday, baby. I feel lucky. Who wants cake? Cake! I do. I do. Let's get some cake. Will you get up, please? Why are you so tired? Are you working? You had a long day. Come on! How do we begin this? Why don't you tell me why you're here? Oh, well. I... I was referred to you, Dr. Harris. Evelyn. Please, call me Evelyn. And I know you were referred. But why do you think you're here? [sighs] I might be going crazy. You're gonna have to do a really good job convincing me of that, Danika. Let's start with you telling me something about yourself. Mmm, excuse me. How old are you? I'm 28. Hmm. You just seem so young to be a psychiatrist and I... I...I was expecting somebody that was older. I got through school very quickly. Look, if you would be more comfortable talking to someone older, that wouldn't hurt my feelings in the slightest. I could recommend a couple... No, no. No. I mean... We'll see. It's alright for me to trust someone. Oh, you can trust me. I haven't talked about my feelings in a long time. They're... bottled up. Why do you think you're feeling this way? That's what I'm trusting you to discover. [sighs] Evelyn. [background pop music] [Kurt] Yeah. Yeah, I noticed. Hey, where did these glasses come from? [glass smashing] Oh! [Kurt] You okay? Alright. [Kurt's muffled voice] No, no, no, no. There's glass all over! I see it. I have shoes on! My God! Hey, uhm... Can I have the car? Where are you going? Uh...You know, I'm gonna have to call you back. Uhm, to the movies. With who? With Myra. Who's Myra? Uh, she's just a girl. I don't know. I'll finish this. Give me this thing. So, can I... So, can I go, please? I have to ask your father. Mom, come on. It's just a movie. You're taking the car with somebody that I don't know. Gimme a break! Are you... [Danika] Randy! He's in the front yard, Mom. Ma! [door opens and closes] Randy! Ran. What's up? Hey. Oh, thank you. Oh, how precious. Oh, wish I could take the credit. She's not mine. Hey! I'm just the nanny. Oh. Whose... The Thomas'. Just down the street. Yeah. They both work so hard. Yeah. I used to work, too. But kids really need their parents. Sure you do a fantastic job for 'em. [chuckles] Well, I have some errands to do. It was nice to meet you. You, too. Bye. She's so adorable. I just meant that a nanny can't take the place of parents. That's all. [knocks at the door] Lauren? Good night, honey. Good night. Brian? Turn out that light! [Brian] Good night. [woman's voice] I miss you, too. I miss you, too. [moans] Really. [hinges squeak] Did you hear that? Hear what? Nothing. Randy. It was horrible. I couldn't tell her what I saw. She thought I was crazy. That job stressed you out, anyway. Yeah. I guess it's for the best that I take some time off. It's what I've been telling you. I can afford to have you stay home for a while. Yeah. It'll make me a better mother. We won't need that nanny. Nobody could be a much better mom. There's so much bad happening in the world. You know, I was reading in the paper today how easy it would be for a terrorist to drop a bomb on the city. This is why I say you're so morbid. What do you have to worry about? You've got three great kids. Just relax until you feel like going back to work. You and the kids are everything. [telephone rings] Hello? Hello? Hello. Who was that? Nobody. I hate that. I just want this day to be over. I want you to make me forget it. Randy, do you think I'm crazy? Yeah. [laughs] I wanna make you feel better. That's a good start. You don't know how much I love you. [girl's voice] Hey, little girl. You're getting me so excited. Come to me, woman. Lauren? What are you doing? Who are you writing to? [girl's voice] I'm afraid my mom will catch me. She's very mean. I miss you. I want you. Lauren? Lauren. Lauren! [girl's voice] Come with me. Mom! [Randy] What are you doing? Checking. I had a dream. Brian? He's not here. He's not here. Brian! Brian! [dog barking] [Randy] Brian? [Brian] Mommy! [knocking at the door] [loud barking] What the hell is your kid doing swimming in my pool at 3:00 in the morning? [dog barking] Come here. [Johnson] Shut up, Jackson. The dog'll bite me. Come here. Go. Go to your dad. I'm sorry. Kurt does it sometimes. [Johnson] Look, boy, you could have been seriously hurt. Do you think you can go in anybody's yard anytime you want to and nothing's supposed to happen to you? Suppose my dog bit you. You know what they'd do? They would take him away. I'm sorry. Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry. We're gonna give him a talking, too. Three in the morning, for Christ's sake. I know. I'm sorry. Have a nice night. Come on, Jackson. Okay. Nobody goes next door. I don't want any trouble. Brian could've been killed. [Kurt] You're acting like I made him do it. Why are you acting... Shut up, and get into bed! [soft music] Can I help you? Yes. I'm looking for a game for my son. He's going to graduate to third grade. Congratulations. He does deserve something special. He'll definitely like this one. Yes? Is it violent? No, no. It's wonderful. It's really fun. You enter this fairy world where nothing bad happens at all. [anchorman] Fifteen minutes ago a school bus exploded on Montgomery Drive. No casualty reports yet. The bus was reportedly filled with school children. Eye witnesses report seeing a man stepping onto the bus shortly before it exploded. What exactly happened is still being investigated. We'll stay with this story as it develops. [woman reporter] Don, we now have reports indicating that the man may have detonated some sort of explosive device that was strapped to him. We have no idea what the motive behind such an horrific act might be, but needless to say, we are in serious chaos here at the scene. Parents are advised to call their child's school for more information. Hello? [nervously] Hello? [thriller music] [tires screech] [shouting] Randy! Lauren. [shouting] Ran! [indistinct voices from TV] [Danika] I'm going to be okay. I'm fine. I hate the news. What news recently upset you? Haven't you heard them? Completely insane. Everybody else knows about it. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten to you. You must not have cable. You say you...you see things. It's an understatement. I have these visions, but they're not really visions. They...feel like they really happen. [sighs] I feel like I'm cursed. I think what you just saw was...unfortunate. Mmm-hmm. That's what people used to say to my mom. What do you mean? [Danika] I was... I was playing with my brother in the yard when I was six. [Danika] And my mom wasn't paying attention. [tires screech] [thump] [Danika] I never forgave her. [music from the TV] Mom, I'm reading. Okay. No laughing. I promise. [Kurt] Ma. This is Myra. Ooh, Myra! Ooh, shut up! Nice to meet you, Mrs. Merrick. Hi, Myra. Nice to meet you. Uh, Myra is from Spain. She's a foreign exchange student. Oh! That's really interesting. Your parents let you come over here all by yourself? Yes. You're...you... How old are you? Sixteen? Mom, we really gotta go. Okay? So, we'll go. You're going to a movie? Yes, and then we're going to Andy's party. His parents are home, right? Sure. I have his number? It's by the phone. But, uh, please, don't call. It's my job to worry. My mother don't care what I'm doing. I'm concerned about my kids. Look, we'll be fine. Okay? I promise. You just stay here and I'll go where it's nice and safe. Bye! Be careful! [Kurt] We will. [door opens and closes] Mom? Yeah? What's a "cunt"? [coughs] What? A cunt. What are you reading? This is the book our stupid English teacher, Mrs. Zachary, is making us read. Mmh-hmm. This is, this is too adult. This is not appropriate for sixth graders. That's what I told her, but she assigned it to us anyway. Mrs. Zachary? Yeah. Well, I'm going to speak to her on Monday. I'm sure her principal will like to know what she's giving the children to read. I wish she were dead. Lauren. Don't you know what an ugly remark that is? Well, it's true. I wish she would die some horrible, disgusting death. Lauren? Go to your room. You don't make such an ugly wish like that. [Randy] Hey. What was that about? I can't believe what she just said. She just said that she wished her teacher would die, and she meant it. It's the age. When have you ever heard Lauren say anything like that? [anchorwoman] Lizzie Geralds disappeared from a playground where she was playing this morning. A volunteer task force is assisting the Police in searching for the young girl. Please, if you have my Lizzie don't hurt her. We'll give you anything you want. But I... I saw her. [Danika] But she wasn't... [Lizzie's mom] Please. But she's not, she's not, she's not alive. What are you talking about? She's not...alive. I'm imagining it. I must be imagining it. [anchorwoman] ...brown-haired girl. Contact your local police immediately. [Johnson shouting] No! Now what? [Johnson] Help! [splash] [Johnson's muffled voice] [muffled cheering and clapping] Huh! Brian! You okay? I'm fine! [blows whistle] I'm starving. We're gonna go to the grocery store and have something to eat later. Lemme see your knee. Ooh! It's a good one! It's a good one. It might be the best one, yeah. [laughs] Lauren? Do you wanna help me make dinner tonight? [Lauren] Sure. Because lasagna takes two chefs. [Lauren] Mom? Mmm? How big do you think my boobs are gonna get? What? My boobs. Do you think I'll have big boobs when I'm older? Lauren. Is that the book that I told you not to read? What is going on in this house? What is all this sneaking? I put that book in the trash. Did you go through the trash to get it? Lauren, I'm talking to you. Give me the book. Fine. Go away. I'm almost as mad at you as I am at Mrs. Zachary. [shouts] [Danika] Get out of the house. Run, run! Follow your sister. Get out of the house. [door closes] Run! Just run! Get out. There's been a murder. What? Call the police. It's a murder! There's been a murder in the house. Call the police. [muffled voice] Hello? [thriller music] [sirens wailing] [helicopter overflying] [soft music] [detective] Ma'am? We didn't find anything. Everything appears to be normal. But I saw it. It was in the house. It was in the kitchen. Sir, can I talk to you for a second? I'll be right back. [muffled voices] [Ryan] She's a normal person. She's in shock. A little stressed. It's the job. I would maybe consider hiring somebody to look after the kids for a while. I think your wife might appreciate the time off. Call me if you need anything. Thank you. [soft music] [Danika] What do you think is wrong with me? I'm not a shrink, Dani. Did it feel good to talk to somebody? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I like her. She's very normal and together. Everything I'm not. I think you've just been under a lot of pressure recently. You need to clear your head. Uh-huh. Yeah. I'm...a rational person living in the real world. I don't know how... Let it go. I'm really worried about the kids. Don't worry about the kids. The kids are fine. You just need to relax. [sighs] What do you think about maybe hiring somebody to help you out with the kids? No. Uh-uh. It's out of the question. I thought it would be helpful to you if you had somebody to help you. [Danika laughs] Oh. Do you think this will protect me? From what? Rubera. What is that? It's my science project. It's this disease carried by rats. It killed thousands of people in Europe in the 1920s. It was crazy. Can't you do a project on solar energy? Or how the lung works? No. 'Cause that would be boring. Oh. Hey. Hello, Mrs. Merrick. Oh. Myra. I didn't know you were here. Mr. Merrick. Yeah. We... We've been upstairs working. She's doing a disease, too. Yeah. Only mine is more common. AIDS. Well, it's nice to see you two cooperating in solving the world's problems. Thank you, Dad. Yeah, uh... We are gonna go back upstairs and do some work. Isn't it late? It's 8:30. Thank you, Dad. Good night, guys. See? You're not the only crazy one in this house. You believe how hot his girlfriend is? They don't make them like that anymore. What 16-year old wouldn't go nuts over that? You wanna have a chance with her. Oh, come on! I don't like that kind of talk. Dani, Kurt's gotta learn about love and sex eventually, okay? You know, I don't want him to be hurt or lied to. I know how that feels, and I don't want him to have his heart broken. Why did you bring that up? You're not gonna let me forget that, are you? I'm sorry. It just came out. I really am. I wouldn't do that to you. I wouldn't hurt you like that again. Come here. Come here. You never talk to her anymore, do you? No. She would've never made a better mother than me. [telephone rings] Tell 'em that I'm out. [telephone rings] Hello? Hello? Hello? [line clicks] [dial tone] Who was it? Nobody again. [telephone rings] Hello. [woman] Hello. Mrs. Merrick? This is Mrs. Zachary. Lauren's English teacher. Oh, Mrs. Zachary! Yes, I've been meaning to speak to you. Good. I've been meaning to talk to you, too. I was wondering if we could meet tomorrow perhaps. Maybe after school? Yes. I... That would be great. I would like that. Great. I'll look forward to meeting you, Mrs. Merrick. Good night. [Mrs. Zachary] Mrs. Merrick. I'm so glad you could come on such short notice. Mrs. Merrick? Mrs. Merrick. Mrs. Merrick? Mrs. Merrick. Mrs. Merrick, are you alright? Are you alright? Yes, of course. I felt really dizzy. Maybe you should just go home. We can have our meeting some other time. No. I... Where's my bag? It's this. I wanna know why you assigned this book to my daughter. I've never seen this book before in my life. Lauren says that you made them read this. Goodness. No, never. In fact, what I wanted to talk to you about is that Lauren is having certain problems in the class. She's a very... worldly young lady. What do you mean? She uses vulgarities. I mean very, very bad words. No, no. Lauren never speaks like that. Ever. I promise you. Well, it's probably nothing. Unless there's something going on at home. Kids go through various phases. Small rebellions. Sometimes language is their way of testing the water. No, never in a million years would I allow Lauren to have access to a book like this. Look, Mrs. Merrick, I'm sure you are a wonderful mother. So don't blame yourself, but this is something... Lauren! [Lauren] Stop! Come back! Stop it! Lauren! Lauren. Lauren. Why didn't you try and help me? You knew, but you didn't do anything. Mrs. Merrick. Is something wrong? It's no secret your mom's been under a lot of stress lately. You think? I mean, she's paranoid over every stupid... Put that away. Sorry. I think she needs a little rest. And, uh...she thinks too much. Is she okay? Yes, she's fine. She's going to be fine. But I'm gonna need you guys to help out a little here, okay? How? Be helpful. Just try not to get her excited, okay? Don't get her worked up over anything. If it was up to Mom, she'd never want us to leave the house. She doesn't even trust us. [door closes] That's not entirely true. I don't trust you because you lied to me. Danika... [raises voice] You lied to me! [Lauren] I'm sorry. Randy, she lied to me! She chose that book. Mrs. Zachary didn't assign it! I'm sorry. "I'm sorry" isn't good enough. Mrs. Zachary is gone. When you're dead you're gone forever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's the matter with you? Lauren? Baby? [squeak] Don't be mad, Mom. I'm not mad. I will never be bad again. I promise. I know, honey. I know. You know I'll always protect you, right? [Randy] Danika. Is everything alright in here? Yeah. We're fine. Everything's really, really fine. [whispering] Right? Right. You okay? [Lauren] Yeah, Dad. [nervously] Will you take me somewhere? Where? To the hospital. The hospital. It's gonna be okay. Okay? Yes. [Danika] I wish I could stop time at those moments when everything is just so happy and perfect. This shouldn't have to come up. Well, medically you're fine. There's nothing abnormal that I can detect. Are you sure? The brain scan is normal. Completely normal. What's wrong? You don't look pleased. So that proves it, doesn't it? Proves what? This is great news, and you wanna go to the dark side as usual. Randy. It means that I'm having hallucinations. That's not normal. Yeah, but it's treatable. The drugs'll help you. Okay. I can tell. We'll go through this together. [telephone rings] Yeah. No, I can't show that house now. Well, they'll just gonna have to wait. [soft music] [Evelyn] Do you trust your kids? Your husband? Uh... Well. [Danika] It's hard. The other day Kurt was studying with his girlfriend and I... And I couldn't help myself. Kurt. [Myra] Don't you knock? My parents used to do the same thing. Always trying to control my life. Are you gonna make Kurt hate... Get out of my house. [sighs nervously] You spend your whole life trying to protect them from harm and evil influences. I mean, just... They don't understand. They're too young. They can't comprehend how fast life can disappear. Do you think... Do you think that perhaps maybe you've been too protective of your kids? What? You mean... It's not possible. Do you have kids? No. Then you don't know. Mmm, you don't know. In this world bad things happen. That's life. Uh-uh. I don't like that. I don't accept that. I don't accept that. You can only do the best you can. It sounds to me like you're a wonderful mother, Danika. But you have to explain to me why are people lying to me. Why did my little girl make up that story about that book? My son is involved with a predator. My husband... Stop it. You cannot protect them from everything. It isn't healthy. Maybe you should let your husband help you out more. What do you know about Randy? Don't tell me how to raise my kids. Mom! [Randy] Okay. Take these. [whispering] I'm scared. Don't be. [whispering] Tell me everything's gonna be okay. [whispering] Everything's gonna be okay. Randy. [echoed] Hello, Mrs. Merrick. Sorry about that. What happened to you? I have AIDS. You have to see a doctor. For what? You need help. No. [moans] [echoed] What I need is a good fuck. Good fuck. Good fuck. [Kurt] Myra? [whispering] Kurt. I like Kurt. [echoes] I like him a lot. I'll see you later. [echoes] He's my baby. [Danika] He's my baby! He's my baby! [telephone rings] [Danika] Hello? [man] They're in a motel. The Cuesta Motel on Frontage road. Room two. I'm sorry. You have me on all kinds of medication, and I don't like it. Drugs are never my first choice, but I felt I had no other option for you. Well, they're not working. I'm having nightmares. I feel worse. I'm worried about my kids. Your kids are fine, Danika. You know what I heard on the radio today? A lunatic exploded himself on a bus. Filled with little kids. But you know that isn't true. I don't know that. And I don't know what I can do about it. I could've helped that little girl, and I didn't know what to do about it. Stop blaming yourself, Danika. You don't have that power. You have to stop worrying about the outside. About things you can't control. And start looking after yourself. You have people very worried about you. And frankly, your fears help no one. I'm panicking everybody. The kids. Randy. Everybody said that he really loved me, but... why would he go to somebody else? He had an affair? It was with my kid's nanny. That's terrible. Mmh-hmm. I really trusted her, too. And I told her everything. And she took care of my kids! How did you find out about it? I hired a detective. So what happened to her? She's gone. It was me and the kids, or her. Randy came back, and he begged for forgiveness. And did you give it to him? Mmh-hmm. We're a family. And I'm not throwing all of that away so somebody else can win. [Danika] I'm going to be okay. I'm gonna be fine now. I'm gonna be okay. I'm going to be okay. I'm fine. [Brian] Mom? Oh, baby. Is something wrong? Uhm, no. Mommy just isn't feeling well. I had your graduation present in my hand and I forgot it. Are you playing hide and seek? Mommy? Are we going to McDonald's? Yeah. Anything you want today. You're the best mommy in the world. And you're the best son. [telephone rings] Hello? [man] They're in a motel. The Cuesta Motel on Frontage road. Room two. I'm sorry. [dial tone] Mommy? [telephone rings] Hello? Are you planning on coming back in? I can't. [Patricia] Your calculations are off again, Danika. You need to come back at once and take care of this. I left Brian with my nanny, but she's not here. She was supposed to look after him. I can't come back right now. Then perhaps you shouldn't come back at all. Danika? Let's get out of here. [male voice, over the phone] Freeze! [over the phone] [bang] Where are we going? Gonna pick up Kurt and Lauren at school. [soft music] [hinges squeak] [shower running] [moaning] [woman] I miss you, too. I do. I miss you, too. [moaning] [moaning continues] [whispering] [smash] [Evelyn] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mrs. Merrick. I am so sorry. [Randy] I should've said something. This isn't the way I... [shouting in pain] Fuck. Fuck! [smash] You want everything to be perfect, don't you? You wanna be safe. Nothing's safe. I'm sick of your paranoia. I'm sick of your crazy fucking fears! [Evelyn] Mrs. Merrick. I am so sorry. I hired you to be my kid's nanny. You should shut up, Evelyn. I tried to tell ya and you wouldn't listen. You're afraid of everything! What are you talking about? You don't get it, do you? What? [laughs] [shouting] What? Your kids deserve better. [smash] [shouting] You! Get away from my kids! [sobs] [soft music] Put on your seat belts. [changing radio stations] [folk music] Are you okay, Mom? [Lauren] Mom, what happened to you? Nothing. Mommy, could we go to McDonald's? Yeah. That's a good idea. [whispering] That's a good idea. [soft music] [Danika] It's alright for me to trust someone. She wouldn't have made a better mother than me. You and the kids are everything. [echoed] Mom! [horn honks] [tires screech] [tires screech] [tires screech] [horn honking] [people talking] [sirens wailing] [paramedic] One more stretcher over here. It's just her. [detective] Is she gonna make it? [paramedic] Yeah, she will. But... I mean, how do you wanna live after something like this? I have no idea. Let's get in the ambulance. One, two, three. [faint] Where are the children? She's asking about the kids. Ma'am, listen to me. We're doing everything we can right now. Let us take care of you. Everything's gonna be okay. [Kurt] Mom. Hey, Mom. What happened? You okay? [soft music] Help me up. [Randy, muffled] There have fire trucks that are so big that the driver is in the back. It's somebody's birthday. Happy birthday, Mom. [soft music] [siren wailing] [Evelyn] You say you see things. [Danika] I have these visions, but they feel like they really happen. I'm a rational person living in the real world. I don't know how I'm seeing these things. [Evelyn] You're gonna have to do a good job convincing me of that, Danika. I feel like I'm gonna hurt my family. I don't know what's happening. I have all these things in my head and I don't know what's real and what isn't. There's been a murder! You understand that when you're dead you're gone forever? I forgot it was my birthday. [Laure] I wish she were dead. [Danika] I'm imagining it. Will you take me somewhere? [Randy] Where? [Danika] To the hospital. I might be going crazy. [Evelyn] You're a good mother, Danika. You know that. [Lizzie's mother] Please, if you have my Lizzie, don't hurt her. I'll give you anything you want. Just bring her back safe. [Evelyn] I'm sure you're a wonderful mother. [Danika] I think I'm crazy. [Evelyn] I'm sure you're a wonderful mother. [soft music]
