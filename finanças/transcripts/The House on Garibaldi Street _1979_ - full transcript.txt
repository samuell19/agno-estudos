[ Dramatic score playing ] [ Teletype machine clacking ] My name is isser harel. It was my responsibility as head of Israeli intelligence to determine whether this information would lead US to eichmann-- into his hands had been placed the implementation of the infamous "final solution"-- or into still another blind alley. Don't you find it curious that Dr. Bauer came to US - with this information? - No, no. I don't find it curious. Dr. Bauer is an honest man who has very little faith in his own government's willingness to pursue war criminals. I don't like it. It worries me. With all their resources, suddenly the German government comes to US to find eichmann. - Why? - I have already told you why. Now there comes a time when you must trust someone. All right. Perhaps Dr. Bauer is an honest man. What about the others? This could be a trap to embarrass the state of Israel. Walter, I deal in traps. I set traps. I can smell a trap. Now this is honest information from a man with a conscience. Now you will just have to trust my judgment. Isser's voice: My first step was to meet with prime minister Ben-gurion to obtain approval for the operation. Isser, what are the odds that this man is really eichmann? Well, Ben-gurion, we can only be certain when we have this man in our hands. I will sanction this action. Because there is a moral significance to it that can't be applied to anything we've ever undertaken before. I believe that it's not only our right, but our duty to bring eichmann to trial in Israel. By doing this, we demonstrate that this man's crimes were not just directed against Jews. They were directed against all humanity. Go ahead, isser. Keep me informed. And isser, don't get caught. [ Chuckles ] Isser's voice: It was determined that our best method of operation would be to continue our meetings in public places. In a city as large as Buenos Aires, it would be easier to get lost in a crowd than to attempt to meet secretly. Isser, what are we facing if we get caught? Well, in most countries, the crime of kidnapping is punishable by death. What about his family's reaction to his disappearance? Well, in my opinion, I don't think the wife will do anything. Any police official will regard his disappearance as a liaison with a woman or an alcoholic binge. No, I don't think she can afford to expose her husband's existence, much less his disappearance. Michael, you will handcuff yourself to this man and if you are arrested, you will surrender this man to the competent Argentine officials. The rest of you will have to escape the best way you can. I will then come forward immediately and assume responsibility for this operation. What about the fraternal order of Nazis here in Argentina? I don't believe that they will abandon him, but this is only a supposition. You have to be alert to radio and newspaper reports. Now our biggest danger is the eldest son nickalous. He is willful and erratic, but his options are very limited. Now if you make a positive identification, let me know. If it is him, you can start a tape interrogation. Even if we can't get eichmann out, we can broadcast the contents to the world. Again, I stress that eichmann must not be harmed. Now nobody can speak for six million dead, but you have been chosen by destiny to act on their behalf, for their memory. We are, in the end, in god's hands. Now may he protect US and help US. Isser's voice: Two of our best agents, Michael and Ari, were assigned the task of discovering the whereabouts of this man Ricardo clement. They traced a man by that name to a house on chacabuco street, where he had lived until three weeks before. Posing as German businessmen, they arrange an appointment with a man named Kessler, a local real estate agent. - Welcome, gentlemen. - Guten tag, herr Kessler. Hupert. Herr deitz. - Have a seat, please. - Thank you. So you gentlemen are interested in buying the property at 4261 chacabuco street? It depends of course on the terms. The land and the house are available for 35,000 American dollars. - Whoa. - 35,000 in American dollars is a very respectable sum. Yes, of course. It accommodates two families. - Mmm. - But one has moved on now. While the apartment is vacant, I'm having it renovated. You say... One family has moved? I assure you the move has nothing to do with any difficulties at the apartment. - Good. - They had four sons. My place did not suit them anymore. They were fine tenants. Very neat. In fact, all my tenants are good Germans like ourselves. What are the taxes? And what is the cost of electricity in this area of chacabuco street? I can assure you the taxes are moderate. As for electricity, in Argentina, the tenants are billed directly by the electric company. They furnish credit reference and the meters are installed in the tenant's name. Good. Herr deitz, this is very important. A very important saving. Thank you. Thank you. I have other holdings. If you don't find anything suitable, please come back. It is always a pleasure to do business with people from the old country. Herr Kessler, auf wiedersehen. Auf wiedersehen. Damn. [ Sighs ] "Vacated." - Yeah. - "November, 1959." We lost him. Credit reference. Credit reference. Credit reference. Ah. Here. Wait, wait. "Fuldner Capri company. Employer." We're not dead yet. - Gracias, senor. - Gracias mucho, senor. [ Patrons chattering ] Isn't it your son's birthday this month? Two days ago. He's seven. I think I made four of them. Part of our work, I'm afraid. I know that. And I accept it all-- absence from home, loneliness, risks. But this assignment, I have no stomach for this assignment. Why? I don't understand the need to find this monster. We can't change history. We can't bring back the six million. If we are caught... Danger is present. Terrorists are attacking our settlements. German scientists in Egypt are building rockets. We're sitting here 10,000 miles away, looking for a man whose crimes were committed 17-18 years ago and we don't even know if he exists. He exists. And when we get him, you will understand why it was so important. You've never seen genocide. Most people in the world haven't seen it. They haven't smelled it-- the ovens, the burning flesh, day after day, month after month, year in, year out... With no one interfering. I was there. Three years in Auschwitz. I saw eichmann. I saw him one raw gray winter day. I saw him standing on a burial mound resplendent in his uniform, smiling, holding a clipboard in his hands checking the numbers of the dead. Ari, I want this monster. Isser's voice: Michael and Ari contacted an attorney named lubinsky-- a man who had worked for US before. And whom we knew could be completely trusted. - Mr. Lubinsky. - Oh, nice meeting you. Oh, Mr. Vogel. Mr. Davidson. - Shalom. - Shalom. - Hey, please sit down. - Well, sit down. - You were told to sit down. - Oh. Now tell me, did you confirm the clement house? Yes, but we have some bad news. The family lived there, but they moved two months ago. However, we have a credit reference. Arthur, could you check with the fuldner Capri company to determine if they employed a Ricardo clement? Mm-hmm. Yes. We're going to have to be very careful how we do this. Sure-- you'll find a reason, I'm sure. Now, look, I've done what you suggested. I have you a local man. He's waiting for you the cafe segovia - avenida Jose ramos. - Write it down. I don't need to write it down. Cafe segovia. Avenida Jose ramos. - Write it down. - Now his name is primo. He's a professor of agronomy at the university. He's bright. He's reliable. Totally totally dedicated. He's above suspicion. Good. How long will it take US to get there? From here, about 15 minutes. Good. Will you please call him and tell him that we are in a dkw. - A black one. - Black dkw. Yeah, and we'll pull up in front of the cafe. - Okay, I'll tell him. - Shalom. - Shalom. - Cheers. - Primo: Chacabuco street. - Yeah. Now, primo... - Write down... - In Hebrew? Come on, in Spanish. Dear George. - Dear George. - Jorge Jorge. - We are feeling well. - We are feeling well. Please come and visit US. Please come visit US. Now in the sender's place, put down Ricardo clement. Ricardo clement. - Chacabuco street. - Chacabuco street. - 4261. - 4261. - [ Speaks Spanish ] - What'd he say? He said he doesn't live there anymore. Yeah, I know, but you see, you don't know him. - [ Speaks Spanish ] - Oh, I see. I want you to go to the house on the pretext of trying to find out who this clement was - who sent you the card. - Yeah, yeah, I know. And try and find the new address. - But don't press. - [ Speaks Spanish ] - No no, I understand. - Good, primo. - [ Chuckles ] Okay? - Yeah. - Take your pencil. - Thank you. [ Dog barking ] - Uh, excuse me. - What is it? Is this chacabuco street 4261? - Yes. - I have a card from a Mr. Clement. There used to be a clement family living here, - but they moved. - Do you know where? No, they moved. That's all I know. Ah, they have a son deiter who works for the sewing machine repair shop around the corner. [ Lighter clicks ] There he is. Deiter eichmann. - Primo? - Yes? Do you know a high-class jewelry store? Sure.why? Tomorrow is nickalous eichmann's birthday. I want to give him a gift via deiter his brother. Well... The card says "to my friend Nicky on your birthday. Affectionately, an admirer." Is tomorrow really nickalous eichmann's birthday? Yes. But you're not to deliver it. Deiter will, we hope, lead US to nickalous. And nickalous to his father. It's our best chance. You engage some bellboy and instruct him to deliver it to nickalous. Michael, there's nothing in this package that's going to explode? No, just a very expensive cigarette lighter. Why do you ask? There's something terribly depressing about a gaily-wrapped explosive. Come on, let's walk. Senora? This young man's name is Pedro. I'm certain he can take care of this errand for you. - Seems a little young. - Pedro: I'm 17, senorita. And I know the city very well. - All right. - Do exactly as the lady says, Pedro. - Yes, sir. - Hedda: Thank you. This is a very important errand, Pedro. - Muy importante. - Anything at all, senora. I'm sure that... Even a boy of your age knows that there are certain things between men and women - that require discretion. - Of course, senora. But this is very very special. When you come back, I want you to tell me every single detail. And you must not leave out anything. I understand. And remember, please... This is our secret. No one must ever know. My word of honor, senora. Are you... Are you free now? - Yes. - Good. I have here the package and the address. Yes? The carpenters working on the house at chacabuco street said that you're the brother of nickalous clement. What is it you want? I must deliver this letter and a gift. Who sent this? One of my friends, another bellboy. At the hotel he gave it to me. He got it from a guest. He was busy, so he said, "you deliver it." I'd still like to know who sent it. What's the difference? They give US these things all the time. - We just deliver them. - I'll see that my brother gets it. I'm supposed to deliver it personally. Can't you give me your brother's address? That's not possible. Now either trust me to deliver the parcel or leave. I'm working. Since you're his brother, I guess it's all right. Don't worry. I'll see that he gets it. Thank you. Ari, if I am 12:00, at 2:00 there is a man I've seen at the cafe de la opera the other night. Describe him. Well, he's wearing a Van dyke beard a black suit and he's having a drink. - Can you see him? - I see him. Well, he has a policeman's eyes. What are you talking about? We don't like to see the same face twice around US. You're getting paranoic. Paranoia is what keeps US alive in this business. Go ahead. Ricardo celement worked for the fuldner Capri company up until October 1958. After that, they've got nothing on him at all. Smile. - Hmm? - Smile. - Is the man still there? - Yes. Hmm. No. Our only safe surveillance is following deiter who will lead US to his brother nickalous or his father... I hope. We'll split now. No no, you sit here and keep an eye on the guy. [ Clears throat ] Come on. What's going on? [ Both speaking Spanish ] - What is it? - An accident. We're being commandeered. It is a custom here. Ambulances are not famous for their service. Say nothing. [ People clamoring ] Michael: So why didn't you wait until he came out of the dentist's and follow him? Hedda: I was nervous. There wasn't anybody about. What else could she do? Look what happened to US. We turned into an ambulance. Pedro the bellboy. What about him? How about sending him back to chacabuco street and have him complain that the present was not delivered and now he's held responsible for the money. It is dangerous, Michael. - Why? - Why? Because it doesn't make any sense. - Why not? - Because he would want to go to the address, because he would get suspicious. Ari, you think like an agent, not like a 17-year-old bellboy. I hope you're right, Michael. This is risky as hell. We don't have a better choice. We're on borrowed time. We will have to begin to take some risks. [ Applauding ] I can't help you, son. You have to help me. The gift wasn't delivered! Now they want me to pay 500 pesos! I only earn 100 pesos a month. I can't pay! You should see the deiter boy again. He won't talk to me. I've got to find nickalous clements. They moved, I told you. They went to live in a section called San Fernando. That's a big section. Where about? I don't know. What does he want? He wants to know the clements' new address. That's no problem. Two days ago, I did some work for the clements. I can give you the address. [ Speaks Spanish ] Ari: Si. - Michael: You have to admit. - We got lucky. Lucky?! [ Mumbles ] If 15 years of searching is lucky, then we're lucky. Now we should have a sign on the corner. Ari: Yes. Garibaldi street. Well then it should be... The second house from the corner. - You get the house? - Yes, yes. Go down the road. - We should have a bus stop there. - Yeah. There's someone coming out of the house. Come to the house. There she is. Yeah. - Well, it's-- - well, describe it. It's-- it's a blond woman. 50-55, uh... 5'6"-7", she looks like a housewife. Well, it must be Vera eichmann. We have the house. [ Distant traffic noise ] You've been wondering, I dare say, - why I wanted to see you. - Yes. Well, there are two reasons. But the first is that Walter eytan tells me you haven't been sleeping well. I tell you it's the missing piece that's keeping me awake. And in this case, the missing piece? We have no... Commercial transportation arrangements with Argentina. We have thought of every conceivable idea. We have not found a legitimate method to get that man out of Buenos Aires. It is this problem that I have not been able to solve. But god did. What do you mean? I have here a message from him. "The state of Israel is invited to send its foreign minister and other state dignitaries to celebrate 150 years of argentinian independence." Why do you look so surprised? Ben-gurion, I am not that old, nor have I been here that long not to be in awe of a miracle. Oh, it's not such a big miracle. After all, if he could part the red sea 5,000 years ago, he can certainly send a plane to Argentina in 1960. Man: Its range is 3,000 nautical miles capacity load. It's capable of flying from Tel Aviv to Buenos Aires with only three stops. Can I depend on a may 11th takeoff? Yes, I'll have it taken out of service to be certain. Now what about the composition of the crew? Isser, the best. Because at some point, they're going to have to know the true purpose of this mission. Yes, whenever you deem it necessary. The bus has arrived. And it's 5:56. Damn it, where is he? Who is that? That must be nickalous eichmann and his wife. And here comes deiter eichmann. Looks like a family gathering. There he is. Adolph eichmann. Well, we know he's clement. But is he eichmann? Clement is eichmann. How can you be sure? You've only seen him once. That was a long time ago. The day we arrived at Auschwitz, it was a cold day. I was holding my little brother in my arms because he was freezing. A guard came... And tore my brother out of my hands, swung him in an arc, and smashed his head against the stone wall. [ Choked ] And he was there. Watching. - Excuse me, sir. - What is it? I represent a north American company. - My name is Jorge aragon. - What do you want? Do you know if this land is for sale? Why do you ask? We're considering building a plant. I show you. Oh, there. Perhaps, would you be so kind to show this prospectus to the owner? - I am subleasing this house. - [ Camera clicks ] Eichmann: I cannot help you. Senor Rodriguez, this is Aaron Lazar. - Sit down. - He's in charge - of the special Israeli flight. - Ah. Yes, of course. We received your correspondence. What can I do for you, senor Lazar? Well, as you know, we're bringing officials of the Israeli government on our DC-6 for your celebrations next week but this is more than just a diplomatic mission for US. We've performed extensive market research and we're interested in the possibility of establishing a commercial route from here to recife, to Dakar, to Rome, to Tel Aviv. Your company will be most welcome. And I will personally see that you have our full cooperation. Coredo, por favor, you will introduce Mr. Lazar to our employees at our private gates and our hangars and terminals so that they are familiar with Mr. Lazar and can afford any and all help. - Very kind, sir. - If there's anything else you need, please feel free to call me at any time. We look forward to establishing a permanent commercial affiliation with the Israeli airlines. You've been most courteous. I hope we won't give you too many problems. On the contrary, problems are what I am here for. [ Fairground music playing ] Two hours. 15 years. Ari: There he is. He's going to get hit! Now we have rented three houses. This is the most secluded one. And this is the one we will hold eichmann in. And the code name is "palace." The other two will be used as backup. The code name is "stronghold" and "gift." In case we are discovered, we have the option of falling back on either stronghold or gift. Sir, what about yesterday's incident? According to today's newspapers, the incident was due to a drunken driver-- Gabriel torres. Now I think that we have to accept it as true. Perhaps it is true. Or perhaps it was a Nazi hunter. Or a victim of the concentration camps operating alone. - [ All clamor ] - Or perhaps a victim of the death camps. No, listen, the only danger we have is from a fraternal order made up of former s.S. Men. The death of eichmann would only bring their clandestine activities out into the open. Why should they want to kill one of their own? We have to believe it was an accident. - It was pure chance. - Isser... - Yes? - We have problems. - What is it? - The Argentine government is asking the Israeli delegation to delay their arrival by a week. [ Isser groans ] Isser: Oh, well... This means... That we have to hold eichmann longer than we planned, which means... That we increase the risk of discovery all the way down the line. The greater risk is losing eichmann. No, we will hold to the plans of may 11th. We have been on borrowed time since we started. Don't forget eichmann has been living on borrowed time for the past 15 years. [ Patrons chattering ] [ Scooter approaching ] - Can I help you? - No no, we're all right. It's just a little problem with the carburetor. We'll fix it, thank you. Muchas gracias. Gracias. Can I have a puff? That's all we need, a friendly neighborhood. It is getting late. I hope primo does not panic. We should have used a radio. No, we should not. If we were to use a radio in this area... We would be picked up in no time by the police. Eichmann: I know who you are! You're Israelis! I know your holy prayer! [ Saying prayer in Hebrew ] Gag him or I'll kill him. Okay, he's fine. Open your mouth. I was a friend of rabbi Beck. Chief rabbi in Berlin. Just open your mouth. Michael: Teeth-- top row: Two gold Bridges. Numerous fillings on the upper-right molars. The bottom teeth are false. Bridges, fillings, bottom false. Scars: Slight scar-- one and one-half inches long below the left eyebrow. Yes, that's there. Appendix scar. Doctor: Yeah. Fracture of the right hand, 1937. I can't do anything about that. - Why not? - We'd need x-rays. Scar: One-inch long in the area of the 10th rib. Left side of the body. Yes, that's there. Michael: Scar above left elbow. Doctor: Yes. S.s. Tattoo of blood type on the left armpit. Scar tissue. You're late, professor. My class ran longer than I expected. - You must be hungry. - Starved. [ Coins clink ] We have him. Is he the man? We don't know. Do you maintain your name is Ricardo clement? S.s. Tattoo of blood type on the left armpit. Scar tissue. I would like some wine please. Sure, obersturmbannfuhrer. What was your s.S. Number? What was your s.S. Number? S.s. Tattoo of blood type on the left armpit. What was your s.S. Number? 45826. Correct. So you're Ricardo clement. You better tell me now your real name. [ Sobbing ] My name is Adolph eichmann. You can easily understand I'm agitated at the moment. I would like to ask for a little more wine. If it's possible, red wine. I have to control my emotions! You can send the cable. The man is the man. I have the greatest admiration for israelites. I knew you were after me. - You knew? - Oh yes. How? Many things. Does it matter? Have you been in touch with any former s.S. - Here in Buenos Aires? - Yes. I went to see general lischke. What for? I thought I was in danger. Does lischke have contacts with the Argentine secret police? Of course. How else could we remain here? How else could we obtain proper documents? [ Barking ] General lischke, two days ago, you said you'd have some news. My father has been missing now for four days. I've checked the morgues, hospitals. There is no trace of him. - Perhaps he has woman, eh? - No. He was due home the evening of the 11th and never arrived. He told me his fears of Israeli commando units. Yes yes, we all have those fears. An Israeli plane is being flown here for the celebration. I believe the Israelis intend to take my father out on that plane. We know about the plane. We are aware of your father's predicament. That plane will never leave Buenos Aires with your father onboard. I have several proposals to make, general. We can bomb the Israeli embassy here or kidnap the Israeli ambassador and effect an exchange. Now listen to me carefully. Your father's situation rests in the hands of our fraternal order. You will cease all activities in this matter. You will make no further effort to locate him. Do you understand? Forgive me, general, but I understand only one thing: My loyalty to my father. That horse knows more about loyalty than you. I've seen horses carry men in blizzards until they froze upright, man and horse in a block of ice. That is loyalty. You and your generation know nothing of courage or of loyalty. You sing our songs. You wear our swastikas. Like so many children playing at the feet of a lost cause, you will never understand. You profane the memory of those who died. I tell you now: Obey my orders, or your father will not be the only eichmann who is missing. Auf wiedersehen, herr general. Who was your superior in section 4-b-4? The chain of command was from the fuhrer to himmler to Heinrich. Heinrich Mueller was in charge of my section. We have testimony that in early 1941, you went to visit the killing camps in Poland at chelmno. I did visit chelmno. I witnessed the shooting of 6,000 women and children, but I had nothing to do with that. You were just watching. Did you try to prevent it? That was not possible. The commandant of the camp-- Frankie-- was a fanatic. He showed me a mound of earth that ran 200 meters. There was a spring of blood which kept pumping from this mound and huge sections of the mound were moving. Frankie explained it was the gas from the bodies which created this movement. He was fascinated by this phenomenon. Could you fix again for me, please, a little boiled rice? My stomach is not good today. As you wish. You understand, general, our surveillance is not what i'd like it to be. I cannot act efficiently. But you do have colleagues on the force, inspector? Only a few. It may surprise you, general, but our police force is highly efficient and in principle, totally honest. For me to work outside the department is a dangerous business. But I just gave you your expenses. Yes. More will be required. But you have nothing to report. We are discreetly checking throughout the city, but so far nothing has turned up. You are certain? In this business, there is no such word as "certain," general. How much more, inspector? Oh, I will leave that up to you, as always. Uh, we are aware of the Israeli airplane due to arrive tomorrow evening and I can tell you now that its passenger complement will be carefully checked before it lands in Buenos Aires. Where will it be checked? I will have the plane delayed and searched in recife, Brazil. We too have our fraternal order, general. It is obvious the Israeli commando team is planning to take eichmann out on that plane. All that is needed is money, general. We are counting on you to prevent their escape, inspector. We can but try. Buenos dias, general lischke Did you state that you would leap into your grave laughing having killed six million people? This was taken out of context at nuremburg. I said this in march, 1945. We were in my headquarters in Berlin. Everything was in ruins. We could hear the Soviet artillery. My staff was demoralized. I made this statement to cheer them up. I never personally killed anyone. I transported people. The commander of Auschwitz, hoess, testified that you introduced the gas chambers and that you personally went to I.G. Farben and contracted the killing gas known as "zyklon b." Yes. - Yes? - Yes, but only for humane reasons. You see, at first the Jews were packed into vans and the carbon monoxide exhaust was funneled into the Van. And the Van drove up and down for 45 minutes... Until the screaming stopped. You really mean that the gas chambers were an improvement. Without question. According to the chemists at farben, death occurred within three minutes. In march 1944, did himmler issue an order to cease all gassing at Auschwitz? - Did he?! - Yes. Mueller mentioned it to me. But you, nevertheless, transported hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz and ordered hoess to have them gassed. Why?! Because himmler's order was verbal. I could act only on written orders. Tell me... Did you ever... Attempt to save one single human being? A man? A woman? A child? There were no possibilities for exceptions. I did however instruct hoess to let the children have a chocolate before they entered the gas chamber. I even had an orchestra of inmates playing a Strauss waltz as the women waited in line to be gassed. You see, I tried to remove fear. [ Cheering ] [ Marching band playing ] - How was your flight? - Fine. Good. I've arranged for you to park the plane on the far side of the airfield. Just follow the maintenance chief. All right? - Right. - Right. Michael: When did you first hear the words "the final solution"? Eichmann: January, 1942 at the so-called wannsee conference in Berlin. We were all summoned to heydrich's villa. Michael: Who was summoned? Eichmann: Myself and my superior Mueller. And the undersecretaries of state. Heydrich stated that he had received a direct order from the fuhrer to institute at once the collection, transportation and extermination of 11 million European Jews. We all fell silent. Then Mueller spoke. He said that Iwas the acknowledged expert in Jewish affairs, that I had a gift for organization, that there was no one in section 4-b-4 more qualified to carry out the fuhrer's order. Don't look around. Look straight ahead. Go on. Why did you stop? Go on. I was trying to recall the precise order of events. After Mueller recommended me, there was a moment of silence. And then heydrich turned to me. His hair was caught in the sunlight just like gold. His eyes were very deep blue. He was a legend. He was a giant in the party. He was Hitler's favorite. He was the pope of the reich. He spoke one sentence to me. "Comrade eichmann, are you prepared to carry out this sacred task?" I suddenly felt... A restraint gone. All emotion gone. In that moment, I believed it was my destiny to ensure supremacy of the Aryan race, to immunize the German people from the inferior races. I realized that in Europe, there could be no redemption for the Jew. In my mind, you had become a virus, a bacillus! Had to be exterminated. I Rose up out of my chair, I saluted heydrich, and I stated that he could consider the final solution already implemented. But in the end, I was betrayed. I was promoted only to... Lieutenant colonel. It is your intention to take me out and shoot me. You're wrong. No, the intention is... [ Coughs ] To take you to Israel to be tried. We would like you to agree to it. I am prepared to let the world know that I am innocent. I was only a small cog in a big machine. I have prepared a draft of a letter for your consideration in which you agree to be tried in Israel. Where were you working in Buenos Aires? At the Mercedes assembly plant. 327 calle Argentina. What was the nature of your work? I polished the chrome. [ Patrons chattering ] Ladies and gentlemen, you will be asked to produce identification documents. Please be calm and try to cooperate. There is no cause for alarm. Probably looking for peronist agitators. Your documents, please. [ Softly ] Oh, excuse me. - There you are. - Thank you. So you are all French citizens. That's right. And you are all friends. We are invited guests of the argentinian republic. We are here to celebrate your independence. Do you have your official invitation with you? - Of course. - May I see it, please? And your invitations? Oh, mine is at the hotel. Mine as well. Are these the same men you saw at the cafe? No, I've never seen them before. My apologies for any inconvenience. We have taken extreme security measures in view of all the dignitaries who have come for our celebration. Oh, that's perfectly understandable. By the way, could you say something to me in French? [ Speaks rapidly in French ] Did you understand? No, but I like to hear French spoken. It's such a sweet language. Buenas tardes. - Vincente. - Si? This is my friend Mr. Zichroni. - Hello, how are you? - How do you do? He's interested in a little "relaxation." After a long flight, everybody understands relaxation. [ Chuckles ] Take your friend to the cafe Maria Christina on calle predona. I promise you will have a very relaxing evening. - Muchas gracias. - De nada. [ Knocks on door ] Lubinsky, help unload the vehicle. You too. - You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. Will he sign the letter? I believe so. His ego may force him. And then of course, he thinks he may save his life this way. - Is he ready? - Yes, I'll get him. What is it, Dani? I don't think I can go in there. I don't think I could look at him. I can handle the camera. No no, Dani will handle the camera. Remember what you told me in Jaffa. "A privilege to be a part of this operation." Yes, I know, but-- but I never realized I would be in the same room with-- with him. It's only the face of a middle-aged man. Come on. Come on. Eichmann: Where are you taking me? What are you doing with me? Michael: Just follow me. Come on. Watch it here. Now there's a chair here. Sit down. Now I'm going to remove your glasses, but I don't want you to see the people around. Clear? You will look down at the floor until I tell you to look up. Then you will stare straight ahead. - Understood? - Ja. We've been here now for eight days. When do we get out of here? There are complications. We still have to set up eichmann's double. Look up. Turn your eyes slightly to the left. - Yes. Hold it there. - [ Camera clicks ] Eichmann on tape: At first, the Jews were packed into vans and the carbon monoxide exhaust was funneled into the Van. And the Van would drive up and down the road for 45 minutes until the screaming stopped. Michael on tape: You really mean that the gas chambers were an improvement. Eichmann on tape: According to the chemists at farben, death occurred within three minutes. Relax. I've given him a sleeping pill. Come on, play. When I'm ready, I'll move. Eichmann on tape: Mueller mentioned it to me. Michael on tape: But you, nevertheless, transported hundreds of thousands... You're smoking too much. And ordered hoess to have them gassed. Just go back to your game. Eichmann on tape: Because himmler's order was verbal. I could act only on written orders. Ben: All right, it's your move. Michael on tape: ...Single human being? A man? A woman? A child? Eichmann on tape: There were no possibilities for exceptions. I did however instruct hoess to let the children have a chocolate before they entered the gas chamber. I even had an orchestra of inmates playing a Strauss waltz as the women waited in line to be gassed. I tried to remove fear. Listen, would you go out and do something for me? Would you go out and keep an eye on Michael? Because he's running those tapes again and again and again and I don't know why. I mean, I think I know why. I think he's gonna do something-- something stupid. - Would you go do that please? - Yeah. [ Sobbing ] [ Engine struggling ] - [ Engine sputtering ] - Car. - Well? - [ Engine starts ] Michael. We have orders. So did he. Our orders... Are to bring him back for trial. He'll never stand trial. We'll never get him to Israel. We can't get out of here. We'll be caught and then he'll be released. He'll disappear in no time. And we'll never be able to get him again. Is that what you want?! I don't. I want to be as close as possible to his throat at the moment when we are caught. - Michael. - You don't understand. We've been here for nine days. They're closing in on US. Too many cars stop around this house. Too many cars, I'm telling you. They're closing in on US! Michael, Michael, Michael. You are not thinking clearly. Listen to me! To you? What do you know? You-- you were growing oranges when we were going up chimneys. Don't you give me that. I was never one of those pampered boys from the orange groves and you know it. The day I was born, the first sounds I heard were the sounds of shooting. At the age of 14, I was already a messenger for the haganah. At seventeen, I was with the palmach fighting our way to Jerusalem to break the siege down to the negev, up to the galilee, and since 1950... I've been with you. I haven't known a day's peace in my life. So don't you ever... Ever... Throw oranges... At me. [ Birds twittering ] Don't blame yourself, Michael. I actually could've killed him. Orders or no orders, I could've killed him. You're not alone. Yesterday, I bought arsenic. I put the arsenic in his rice. I took it to him. At the last moment when the rice was on the spoon, I threw it away and now I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't kill him. Why? Because... No matter what I've been told, I can't stop the voice inside my head, the voice that keeps telling me no one cares. The trial will mean nothing. Eichmann killed Jews. Jews are meant to be killed. They're expendable. Now and forever. I believe it. If he'd take six million cats and dogs and put them in the killing centers to be gassed, there would have been an outcry. Great outcry. The Americans and the British would have bombed the killing centers out of existence. But he just killed Jews. No one cared then and no on cares now. No, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, no, people do care. They have to. In my 10 years of flying international routes, I have never been subjected to such abuse. The chief of air traffic control at recife airport absolutely refused to permit US to take off. - What did he want? - I don't know. He made repeated inspections of the documents of everyone onboard. So we can't risk stopping there on the return flight. So you are suggesting that we bypass recife and fly directly from Buenos Aires to-- thank you. Fly directly from Buenos Aires to Dakar, Senegal non-stop. - Pilot: Yes. - That's beyond the listed range of the plane. Well, I've made some preliminary calculations. Maximum fuel, minimum take-off load, say 10,000 kilos. We can extend the range to make to 4,347 miles non-stop, but of course a lot depends on following tailwinds. What happens if you lose an engine or you run into a tropical storm front? We'll find a way. Captain... I would like to advance our take-off time. - Why? - Just in case we have been observed or someone is aware of our activities, a change of time would tend to throw them off. - Yes, if it's imperative. - It is. Done. We take off at noon. - You okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay. [ Mumbles ] Vicente: Tell me, did your friend zichroni go to the cafe Maria Christina? - Oh, disaster. - What? He had too much cognac. Crashed his car. - Was he hurt? - Nothing serious. He's already been released from hospital. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Michael: How did it go? - Perfect. - My Israeli passport. - Uh-huh. - How do you feel? - She's a perfect surgeon. I hardly felt anything. - Your new passport. - Thank you. - I'll look at it later. - Okay. You leave tomorrow. 11:00 am first-class. Air France flight 202 to Paris. Police report. Hospital admission. - Treatment-release. - Uh-huh. What are you doing to me? Just going to give you... A little injection, something to make you slightly sleepy. The weather all the way from here to recife is free from storm fronts. What kind of tailwinds can we expect? An air France plane bound for recife reports 128-mile tailwinds at 28,000 feet. Well, I hope we haven't inconvenienced you - by early departure. - Not at all. - Happy landings. - Thank you. [ P.A. announcement in Spanish ] Lazar: My friend, I think we shall meet again. I think sometime early next year perhaps we shall have a scheduled flight. - Mm-hmm. - Once a week to start with, - but we'll work it out. - Fine. Good. [ Vincente speaking Spanish ] Tell me, how is your playboy mechanic? - Ah, he'll live. - But not for long. Not if he keeps drinking cognac all the time. Ah, true. [ Speaks Spanish ] Okay. [ P.A. announcement in Spanish ] Carolina! [ Talking angrily in Italian ] [ Contreras speaking Spanish ] Parking brakes? Check. Emergency alternate control valve? Normal left. He signed the letter and we are not kidnappers anymore. Just smugglers. Ground control, Israeli Alpha X-ray two two. Taxi ifr Tel Aviv. Iraeli Alpha X-ray-2-2 taxi runway 1-1, wind is zero-niner-zero. Contact tower 1-1-9.1 for takeoff clearance. Ground control, Israeli Alpha X-ray 2-2, is requesting takeoff clearance. Israeli Alpha X-ray 2-2, hold position. Repeat, hold position they have smuggled an Argentine citizen aboard that plane. I order you to instruct the plane to return to its berth. You must wait for Rodriguez. I have no authority to issue that order. Ground control, Israeli Alpha X-ray 2-2 requesting takeoff clearance. Israeli Alpha X-ray 2-2, please hold your position. Dispatch a police vehicle to the plane and inspect its passengers. What's the problem? We've been told to hold. And we run the richest mixture of fuel on the ground. Meged says you have to make a decision. Hmm. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Speaks Spanish ] [ Both speak Spanish ] This inspector contreras claims there's an argentinian citizen - on your plane. - That's absurd. Here's our manifest. The manifest is in order. A man was taken to that plane. A man whose head was bandaged is there such a man on board? Yes, he's one of our mechanics. Everyone saw the man. His name is zichroni. He was in a car crash. He was injured and went to a hospital. I've got the reports. - May I see them? - Yes, of course. We're still holding. - What the hell is happening? - We've been told to hold. 17 minutes. 2,000 liters of fuel, we'll never make Dakar. Five minutes, we go. Isser, if we do that, we won't be able to land anywhere. Every Interpol office in the entire world will be alerted to US. Five minutes. Here's the highway police report, hospital admission, diagnosis, and hospital release. I tell you there's an Argentine citizen aboard that plane. I am lodging an official protest. What's that? Official? What's official? Where are your orders? I require no orders. 20 seconds, then we go. Sir. Israeli Alpha X-ray 2-2, cleared for takeoff. Remember my words. These Jews have tricked you. Senor Rodriguez, if there were an error in the manifest, would it go badly for you? Not if their documentation was in order. - Why do you ask? - Just curious. Mr. Lazar, if a man is fooled in a noble cause, how can things go badly for him? What do you mean by fooled? This afternoon, a young man who called himself nickolaus eichmann came to my office. There's an 8:00 plane to Santiago. I think you ought to book space. I already have. How will the people you left behind get home? They'll find a way. Shalom. [ Dramatic score playing ]
