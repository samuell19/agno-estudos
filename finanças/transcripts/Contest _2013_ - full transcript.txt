(MUSIC PLAYING) BOY: I fly solo. Trust me. I am not a team player. I am not an athlete. I don't even know how to swim, which is just one of the sources of ridicule I've gotten since freshman year and the one that the golden boys of Saint Raymond's swimming team are enjoying today. That's Matt Prylek, our school's best swimmer and my worst nightmare. And that's me, Tommy Dolen, the one supplying all their laughs. My dad tried to teach me to swim once with the same warmth that's going on here, but that didn't work out so well either. Welcome back to a new school year. Now, if anyone had told me in this moment that, in less than a month, I would develop the most unlikely friendship, I would have said they swallowed way too much water. ♪ Above the noise is where I'll be ♪ ♪ I hear a voice in my head ♪ ♪ It's telling me to slow it down ♪ ♪ I'm thinking that I might just take the clue ♪ ♪ My thoughts are flying out of bounds ♪ ♪ I'm hoping that the miracle is true ♪ TOMMY: Look, I know a lot of people are worse off than me, even if you couldn't tell it by looking at them, like this kid who's been bumming coinage here the last few days.

I don't mean your teachers or your principal. I'll talk to the boys. Maybe they just want to pal around. They didn't know you can't swim. (LAUGHS) Of course they knew, all right? Today was the worst, but it's not just today. It's every day. The names, texts, online humiliation, taking shots, stealing lunches. Why didn't you tell me? I was afraid you'd invite them over for Sunday dinner. I could make braciole. They'd like that. Table seven needs their check. Listen. Just think. If you all just got together and talked... (TV) This week, we're announcing the finalists for our Teenage Cooking Contest right here on Mealtime Network, where the winner will walk off with her or his own TV show, plus a special grand prize I'll be revealing a little later. I already told you, all right? I'm not joining any contest. It's past the deadline. Should have. Could have won. Well, it's too late now, all right, and that's just what I want, give them more excuses. (ENTRY BELL RINGS) I'll finish up here. Go wait on the new customer. Prylek! I'm still hoping to hear you get life imprisonment one day, but I think this'd do for a start. Her family just moved here from Kansas. She goes to your school. She's a blogger, and she explained to me what that was. I'll take care of tables two and four. Here. You take this to Sarah. When are you gonna learn you don't have to do everything alone? Just talk to her for just a minute. Our special added prize will be $50,000, and today we're announcing our third contestant, and this one's a local boy, Saint Raymond's own Tommy Dolen! (PLATES CLATTER) (GASPS) Thanks, Rip. Only three more contestants left to be announced. Then tune in next week... I'm sorry. when all 16 square off to compete... I-I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. ...and $50,000. (TELEPHONE LINE RINGING) MATT: You told Abby about the job. You helped her move up here. She'll talk to her boss. MAN: Think so? She still isn't picking up. I'll fix this in the morning, moron. Mangia, bello! I know I should have told you I was taking your pizzelles down to the TV station and entering you in that contest. I can't talk on TV, all right? Can you please just call them and tell them that I can't do it, all right? I'm sorry. I have to go to Ned's before school. Yeah, but I think-- I can't. I just can't, all right, Gran? (KISS) I love you. Bye. Bye. Matty! Matty! Your alarm clock broken? Five minutes, dressed and out. TOMMY: Once a month, I go to pay rent to the landlord of the pizzeria, Ned Foley. Hey, Dolen! You brain-dead? Like I was saying, every month I go to Ned Foley's, the landlord of Gran's pizzeria, to pay the rent, but who knew today's visit would trigger something completely unexpected? (TELEPHONE LINE RINGING) I'll see her when she shows up. (NED LAUGHS) Sold it all, and I want you to level the entire block. Now, the one problem's gonna be the old lady that runs the pizza place. She's been there since the War of 1812, and she doesn't get that the chain places are killing her. My grandfather put this stupid clause in her lease. I really hope she doesn't remember it, because I am screwed if she does. (LAUGHS) Not that it'll help, though. Don't think her and her goofy grandson have a dime to their names. Look, if she's gonna be a problem, I may need you to help me out around this, all right? Just like you did with the pub. Then not only will I give the demolition job to you, I will also recommend you to the buyer to build his brand-new-- (RATTLES) Oh. Hold on a second. Yeah, no problem. Did you withdraw me from the contest yet? Okay, good. Don't, all right? I'll see you later. TOMMY: I usually try to stay under the radar, but I gotta do this for Gran, you know, even if it makes things worse at school. When I was curled up on that pool deck choking up water, Matt Prylek was bragging to all his buddies about how his brother helped his ex-girlfriend Abby score a job as the Assistant Principal's new secretary. Prylek was dangerous enough before. Now he's got a skeleton key to the school. As per our new zero-tolerance policy, effective immediately, you are suspended from all extracurricular activities. What? That's total bull. And any infraction of any school rules could result in expulsion and home schooling until June. Uh, Ms. Sykes, it's Matty's senior year. All the assistant coaches from--from the colleges he wants to get into can finally come see him, so... Mr. Prylek, I'm aware of Matthew's-- Kyle, please. It so means Matty's whole life. Don't let one stupid... MATT: Reject wreck my whole career. Pardon? Oh, you are not helping yourself. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Come in, please. Oh, sorry. I didn't realize you were still in the meeting. Uh, Coach Nadley called, and I reconfirmed your anti-bullying campaign meeting with the board for 11:00. Sorry to bother you. No. Thanks, Abby. Uh-huh. Matthew... I'll reduce your suspension... to a one-month period if you'll-- One month? Are you out-- What do I have to do? People look up to you. Stop all the bullying immediately. If you become an anti-bullying role model within 30 days, I will restore all your extracurricular activities. You mean like-- like doing what? I mean like for the next month, go out of your way to be kind to the kids who are bullied at this school, starting with Tommy Dolen. Done. Done. Okay. Go. Be nice. Be kind. Get out. (LAUGHING) Okay, you got that one. (BOYS LAUGHING) Dolen! My mom says you're gonna be a big TV star. Bad enough this place pumped money into Home Ec which should have gone to athletics-- Yeah. Now you're gonna make us all look like-- Joe! Knock it off! But you were the one who planted the seed in her head. How about an espresso? Kyle, I thought I said I need to-- Come on. It's just coffee. A cooking show, Dolen? Isn't that the kid whose grandma runs the pizza joint? Uh, yeah. He's just been picked to be on a TV cooking contest. The teachers were talking about it. If he wins, he gets his own show and $50,000. KYLE: We're a team. Think about it. You volunteer to do this, and Sykes may lift your suspension sooner than the end of the month. I got nailed 'cause of that loser. Not having the brains to see a whole new security system is what got you nailed. So now I gotta help him win 50 grand? No! You just-- You just have to appear to be helping. Once he says yes, then we'll work on sabotaging this whole thing. So I can get expelled? We'll do it in a way that it won't stick to you. You'll see. It'll be fine. How? Just leave that to me. Once we're in-- Wait. He should pay for all the trouble he's caused me, but what's in this for you? The biggest job I ever had and helping out my bro. I don't think there's this many rules to pick a Pope. What? That's so stupid. No, it makes sense to me. You can't do this on your own. You have to have a team. A team? I don't need a team, all right? I cook alone. Besides, where am I gonna find two-- Friends? I'm sorry, bello, but, uh, I don't qualify as one of your peers. You know, I'm not gonna be around forever. Maybe this is a good chance for you to branch out. Who wants to? If I didn't have to-- (DOORBELL RINGS) (DOORBELL RINGS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) This contest sounds awesome, and I know I was totally out of line and wrong but-- about the pool and today. Sorry, man. I know I may have hassled you a little, but-- Yeah, only three years. So when's this whole contest thing over? F-Four weeks, but-- That's perfect. You need a bodyguard so, that way, no one-- Yeah, so no one drowns me or tries to beat my face in? With me around, no one will even give you any trouble. Why? Do you want exclusive dibs? Look, I don't know what you're up to, Prylek, but this is my house, all right? This is the only place where I can come to be without people like you-- Ciao, ragazzo. I'm Tommy's grandmother. You like pizzelles? I would love one. Wow. Hi. I'm Matt. Oh, you're Matt. Yeah. Come on in the kitchen. Thank you. Mmm, these are really good. Tommy made them. Oh, yeah? Family recipe. Interesting. ♪ Take me off the sidelines ♪ ♪ Blow sand beneath my feet ♪ ♪ Oh, break me out this gilded cage ♪ ♪ That holds me ♪ Come fill my veins with sunlight ♪ ♪ Send a postcard from my lungs ♪ ♪ I want to taste salvation-- ♪ Great dinner last night, T! Sheesh, man, you can cook! And that Gran of yours, she's off the hook. I wouldn't take any bets on that. Anybody bother you today? Not till 10 seconds ago. Have you been thinking about what we were talking about? Yeah, I don't-- don't want a bodyguard. Not that. You've already got one. I was talking about having me join your posse. Your Gran told me how you need a cooking crew, and I have made some pretty mean barbecue-- Yo, Julia Childish! What's up? Told you to back off, Joe. Hey, how about you and I take a walk down to that nice new TV station of yours, huh? I hear it's only an eight-story drop. Ohh! (STUDENTS GASP) Ohh! Let's roll, T. (COUGHS) Off the team? Why? Well, well, the diving instructor, he--he said that I need to take a month off of swimming, so-- You know, 'cause I sprained my hand. It has to do with the force of how you hit the water. You just got-- Diving and swimming, you gotta protect the hand, you know. Then why did you hit-- You know what? Next time, I'll knee him one. Matt and I may join Drama Club. (LAUGHTER) Uh... You're--So... if you want to give me your, um, dry-cleaning bill, uh, receipt, you know, for a--for shampoo and soap-- It's not that you're not clean, you know. I mean, of course you're clean, but, uh, it's just... I have to get to class. Bro, you need my help with more than just getting a cooking team. ♪ It's all right ♪ It's okay ♪ You can't hold us at bay ♪ ♪ And you know that it's time ♪ ♪ That we're gonna push that line ♪ MATT: Those two right there. That's our crew. They c--They can't even turn up a flame. You want to bet? I know these two guys. They're just not here yet. They're the only ones close to being in my league. Where was this side of you out in the hallway? I know my way around the kitchen. When I'm done with you, there won't be a room in the house you've missed. (LAUGHS) That's one. He's really good, but he's quiet, you know, shy, keeps to himself. Haven't heard a word from him all last year. Up until yesterday, I could have said the same thing about somebody else around here. Maybe he can't talk. Okay, I got this. Ahem! Hi. My name is Matt, and I don't sign. (GIRL LAUGHS) Do you have a pen and paper? I can write a note. Oh. Oh, uh, let's go outside into the hallway so we can talk-- talk--talking. (AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) No worries. You're starting to... embarrass yourself, mate. (GIGGLES) And then we win the contest. So, uh, are you on board? I don't... know about... being on TV. What if... I have... to speak? All the... guys in my old school... always made fun of-- Anyone tries bullying you, and they're gonna get their abs kicked in. But, hey, girls must love the accent. Am I right? (LAUGHS) Yeah. The fact that I'm... cute as a cloud... doesn't hurt either, but-- And that's what's so great about this, too. I mean, we get to make all these amazing dishes, and we don't have to talk or deal with anybody else. There's the other one, Bobby Butler. We have to go into class, though. Bobby Butler, Matt Prylek. You're on our squad now. My boys and I are gonna make you a TV star. Now don't be late for class.

Bro, I-I'm trying to be different, and that's not gonna happen overnight, but I am trying. Can't you give me a chance? (CHUCKLES) See you guys later. This is totally the right place. Let's go meet our public. Aren't we... a bit seedy in our shirttails... and thongs? Thongs. Okay. Um... it's time for dessert, guys. Y-You can just watch. Take notes for when you hit puberty, bro. Ladies, you here for the show tonight? My boys and I could get you tickets right in the front row. (UKRAINIAN ACCENT) No need to go to such trouble. Oh, we'd be happy to do it. It's no trouble. Tommy's gonna be the star of the show. Is he? And then later, we're gonna have a little beach party at the lake, so meet us here right after the show, and don't forget your thongs. (GASPS) Ow. Chicks. The Phils could use that one up on the mound, though. What an arm. I thought you were supposed to be protecting me from getting beat up? Relax. It'll only sting for an hour... or three. Should I still be taking notes? Let's go. We're very excited to be here in our network owner's old high school auditorium, right here in his hometown and ours in beautiful Saint Raymond. Our contestants span the country, but our next team is homegrown. Please say hello to Team Tommy! (DRUMROLL) (APPLAUSE) And from Detroit by way of the Ukraine, the Bartosh cousins! (APPLAUSE) (DRUMROLL) (CHEERING) And finally, from Connecticut, Team Dennis! (DRUMROLL) (APPLAUSE) Yeah! Thanks, Rip! I just want to say how fortunate I am to be working with my two talented underprivileged teammates whom I discovered on the Interne-- Yeah, we'll have plenty of time to talk later, but right now, let's get the first round of our contest under way. Here's how it'll work. Our distinguished judges will eliminate one team each show until we pick our big winner... Shh! on the grand finale night. Wait. ANNOUNCER: Thanks, Rip. And every team captain is a wonderful chef, so it's anyone's game. The winner of "Teen Chef" will go on to host their very own TV show. To be a TV show host for the Mealtime Network, one must be highly self-disciplined. ♪ Feeling the world go round... ♪ Every team has received the contest rules and must follow each one of them precisely.

Tune in next week, when we'll lead off with each team captain telling America how they discovered their signature dishes. Until next Friday, good night. DIRECTOR: Cut! That's a wrap. Hey, how would you like to take over that assignment for me next week? I believe the competition rules state that there shall be no delegation of a captain's duties. I got you covered. Can't wait.

Well, no, I really wanted to help you on the contest, and I thought if--if you knew that I'd been suspended for harassing you, you might-- might think... I might think what? That I wasn't being real or else I was pulling some crap. Matt Prylek pulling crap? I got that spice thing you wanted. Saffron. I said saffron, saffron from a spice shop. This is--This is paprika from a warehouse. Well, well... they're both red. Why are you really doing all this? I feel horrible about the pool and assembly and last year. I was hoping that we could work on the contest together and then... maybe the school's anti-bullying project? Hey, Sarah. What are you-- What are you doing here? Respectfully whispering. It's just some research for a blog I'm writing. In the cooking area? It's a hot topic all over town. Where are all your adoring fans? I, uh--I-- You know, couldn't... find the one I was looking for, so, uh, I came here, and it worked. She found me. Well, she doesn't have time to bask in the glow of your spotlight. Too busy, uh, reporting on pop culture, huh? Well, it doesn't come with a TV show, but someone should hold a mirror to the narcissism of society. You know, feeding people isn't such a selfish thing. And feeding your ego publicly isn't such a selfless one. MATT: Eye contact. GRAN: Just picture your audience... Um... Are you okay? Um, oh, yeah, yeah. You know-- You know, but people-- people do things for all kind of reasons, right? You know, reasons other people may not even know about, so... Right. And even if I was doing this for me, I don't get much props from others around here anyway, so... (SCOFFS) Could you say three sentences in a row without "I" or "me" in them? Uh, would that make you want to spend more than 30 seconds with me? (LAUGHS) There you go again. No. I-- Nah, I was just-- I was just wondering if you want to-- Shh! (SIGHS) Chicks. You spent what on saffron? Do you want him to think I'm sincere? That's a whole day, both jobs. I'd better get my money's worth. This Friday night's the one... when you blow the contest. He must totally trust you by now. I wouldn't say totally. Besides, the coach just left me a message. He wants to see me in the morning. This might already be over. Do you have a world map that shows the picture of you in the center? You made a commitment, so make sure Dolen trusts you by Friday. Again, how am I supposed to pull this off without getting caught? Well, what do you guys have planned for Friday night's competition? Each team is doing a different culture's food, and Tommy hasn't picked out our culture yet. Well, the minute he does, let me know, and I'll tell you how to screw it up. I'm pretty sure I can figure that out on my own. (LAUGHS) Yeah, because you've done so well thinking for yourself so far. Let me do the thinking for the both of us, all right, boy brainless? COACH: Two top teams? U of Texas and UC. Which one? Well, you're gonna have to guess, boy. Oh, my God. When? Yeah, today. But, I-- And then I had to tell 'em that you were suspended, and he decided to pass on a potential disciplinary risk. You're batting .500, Matt. You better figure out a way to get reinstated. Matt. Matt. Matt. Man, thanks for the-- Thanks for the saff-- (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS) All right, diversion excursion. It's time to take care of Matt and put Dolen out of commission at the same time. Me? No, no, no, no. I have to deal with the Booster Club. There were other witnesses.

You trying to get me out of here? I'm trying to help you! It wasn't meant for that runt. It was for Dolen. And how is that supposed to help? He'd be out of the contest. Your alibi is that you were with Sykes. It still worked out good, though. Look, Team Thomasina needs three guys, right? All right, well, I heard the little pipsqueak broke his arm. Now you become part of the onstage action, and you'll have a much better chance of blowing this party apart. TOMMY: No, wait. He's crazy. He doesn't know what he's doing, and this is how he wants to make things up to me? He's been a big help so far. Yeah, and why? I mean, I don't trust him. First he changes from sadist to saint overnight. And he's done a lot to become your friend. But for what? Maybe he didn't mean to do what he did to me today, but, Grandma, I wouldn't be surprised if he greased the floor in Home Ec just to get on the team. (CHUCKLES) Oh, bello. I'm getting so close, Grandma. You were all doing beautifully. Suppose I do let him on the team and we lose? Teams lose every day. (SIGHS) This isn't about a team. It's about winning this thing so-- I-It's about winning, all right? It's not about making friends or taking in a stray. Well, it would seem to me that a good athlete would be motivated to win, too, don't you think? (GROANS) MATT: So Abby finally agreed to have dinner with you after eight years? KYLE: Seven. Shut up. Stay on point. Don't forget to let me know as soon as Dolen tells you. Got my own idea about Friday night. Buena suera, granya! Ciao, ragazzo! I got it. This Friday, Italiano! We'll do an entire Italian feast. Everything from ribolletto to pignoli. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) You gotta teach me how to speak Italian, Gran, prego! Women love guys who talk foreign. Not always.

No, but I was wondering-- I don't understand why you're such a-- I don't know. Why you flipped the switch so fast. I--I told you. The pool and then all the other... Yeah, but, I mean, why do it in the first place? Why spend so much time-- I mean, it's just not you. People expect you to be a certain way. They laugh if you are. They laugh at you if you're not.

It's set up for Italian. And then me and Matt will be making the main course together. Braciole. MATT: Bobby, you wait here. Tommy, Philip, follow me. Ladies, ladies, I--I realize we got off to a bad start, but we're really good guys. And we were just talking to ourselves. "How can we patch things up with those beautiful cousins?" And we thought-- we thought, food, food! So we want to cook you a meal and-- with a special menu that we, uh, just created to show our true intentions with you. (STOMPING) No! No, no, no, no. We don't think of you like that! No, no, no, I mean, we do, but just not like-- Just shut up before-- (WINCES) BOBBY: Anya, Inna, Lada, Someday when I finally... mature, I know I'll treat women much more respectfully than other guys do. Ladies, would you please wait for me outside? You can't hear what I have to say to these three. (ENTRY BELL RINGS) Dudes, you make this so easy. If I'm going to... hang out with you... I'm definitely... gonna need more stamina. Okay, Italian. This is what you're gonna do. Actually, Tommy changed things up. Cooking an Italian meal on Friday's show could be... misinterpreted. Then what's the new-- You know, no, no. I gotta go, and I gotta get changed. No! Tell me! A luau. What happened to your face? Did you get in a fight? I hope he looks worse. Talks like a girl now. TOMMY: My face? Nothing, okay? Actually, um, I took on 50 guys at school that wanted to ask you out, so... Uh-huh. Ms. Sykes said that you and Matt Prylek are working together on the school's anti-bullying campaign? (LAUGHS) You two make a curious team. Yeah, tell me about it. I hear you two have quite a history. But it could make an interesting article. How about I interview you two together for the school blog? How about you do it at my place tomorrow night? Me and Gran are having Matt over. How about I do it next Monday between classes? I don't get a good vibe from your buddy, and I would prefer to keep my time with him short. We can always do my part of the interview over lunch, say, Friday?

(LAUGHS) (APPLAUSE) RIP: Thank you, Team Dennis! Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to now enter the Chunnel with me as we leave the United Kingdom... Whoa! and we head to France with our favorite mademoiselles. (APPLAUSE) Ou est le mademoiselles? My foot. I think it's broken. Mademoiselles? We can help you up. Mademoiselles? What are you doing? Your cue to come out was when Team Dennis left the stage. You're late. Let's go. I'm so sorry! Thank you! According to contest rules, if you're ever late for a second entrance, you're out! Will, that's terrible! What are you giving them the heads-up for, you idiot? Get me a latte. Go. Kyle, it's Matt. Where are you? Thanks, Bartosh cousins. And next up for tonight, Team Tommy. (APPLAUSE) ANNOUNCER: Don't touch that remote. Team Tommy will be right back. Matt's gonna double over in pain. The pig'll go flying, hit the ground. Contest over. Matty's not busted. Chef Girl-ar-dee finished. Pizza joint leveled. And we're back in 3, 2, 1. (APPLAUSE) (GROANS) (AUDIENCE GASPS) (APPLAUSE) RIP: Whew! Somebody sure turned up the heat at the Mealtime Network kitchen with that one! Something funny? Uh, need to hit the head. I'll--I'll meet you guys in the parking lot? RIP: We'll be right back with the conclusion of this week's "Teen Chef" episode right after this commercial break. Stay right where you are. And Team Tommy wins again, thanks to you. It was instinct. For a second, I thought it was all over, but you surprised me. Nice save. Congratulations. Dinner's on me tonight. Can I invite my teammates to come too? Sure. You want to catch those guys before they leave? Sure. (COUGHS) Don't ever do anything like that again. Walk home. ABBY: I was so nervous for a second. TOMMY: So was I. Oh, me, too. Oh, hey, um, Philip and Bobby already left, but Tommy and his grandmother would love to join us. W-We'll have to take a rain check. Matty and Joe decided to go for burgers. It's amazing how much Matt's changed in such a short time. Well, I've been trying to coach him. It's not easy raising a teenager all alone. But you know that. By the way, love your pizza. Best in town. (CRYING) (TELEPHONE LINE RINGS) Hey. JOE: Hey. Feels like I'm going behind his back talking to you like this. No! He needs perspective! This morning, I heard him tell Dolen he wanted them to take a drive to Hillview later. What? Can you believe it? He's been acting so weird lately. Call him. Tell him you want to work out. Stall him until I get there. Then while I distract him, I need you to plant a little device in his bag. No, man, that's so--- Hey, do you want things to get back to normal or not? (HANGS UP) Hey, Matty. Look, I know you're-- Joey. Hey, will you give us a sec? I want to talk to Matty. Well, you better make it quick, 'cause I'm meeting up with Tommy after my workout, and I need your car. I'll wait in there. Well, what do you want? KYLE: Dad always said kill each other in fun, but don't raise your hands to your brothers even once in anger. I screwed up. I'll do better at keeping things under control from now on. We moved up here after the fire in Philly. Some cheap electrical wiring. Kyle had taken me camping that weekend. People assume that we lost our parents and our little brother Eddie in the fire, but Mom made it out. She couldn't handle it, though, so we moved her up here. And then Kyle moved us to Saint Raymond so we could be nearby. I come up to see her whenever I can. TOMMY: Can I, uh-- I mean, would you like me to come in with you? No, but next time, though. Thanks. Thanks. (GIGGLES) Looks hot. Oh, thanks. (GIGGLES) You already apologized for it. I don't want there to be any weirdness between us. Bro, can you imagine living like this every day? We can once I close this deal. Kyle, I don't want to do this anymore. You're still mad at me? No. Tommy and I are friends now. And these past few weeks not pushing anybody around, I like it. Plus the whole school bullying campaign? You can still be Mr. Anti-bullying guy, and you can still be friends with Dolen if you want. He'll never know you were the one that screwed him-- No. You want college, swimming career, incredible future? Got it. I would have liked that, too, but right after high school, I had some instant grown-up responsibilities. I just can't make the connection. I mean, Matt was being weird up there because he wasn't feeling well. But he kept glancing up at his brother the whole time he was on the stage. 'Cause he was sick, you know, the same way you'd look for your parents or I'd look for Gran. I mean, there's really no big mystery or drama. Then tell me how Tommy losing helps. I'm not sure I can trust you with that. How am I supposed to decide if I don't know? There's no decision to make! Matty, you and I have been on the same team since the day you were born. How do I know I'm not gonna get caught? If that happened-- If I get this gig, college won't matter. We'll be set. Yo, Kyle. It was really weird, almost like-- Do I detect concern for me-- um, someone at this table? I tried. We're gonna do it the other way. What's the big rush? You'd better get in there. (LAUGHTER) Hey, come on. Play it again! Play it. Do it. Let's hear it! Come on! Play it again, dude. MATT: ...couldn't handle it, though, so... (LAUGHTER) we moved her up here, and Kyle moved us to Saint Raymond so we could be nearby. I come up to see her whenever I can. This lady's nuts. Fine. Don't believe me, but I'm telling you, steer clear. He just found out he lost his dream college opportunity because of his suspension, and he blames you. Matt and I are friends. You don't get it. Your whole friendship has been a joke. He laughs at you behind your back. The joke's over. Stay away, man. Hey. I was--was running late. Sprinted all the way here, and I, uh-- I tripped. Okay. Are you all right? Will be in two minutes. Matt, you do anything to him now, and you're gonna get expelled. Look, keep a low profile. Take care of him Friday night in the contest like you were planning to. But he's-- Look, next week, we'll go out. We'll get some ski masks and teach him a lesson he'll never forget. Hey, are we still on to meet outside the library? Actually, I'm sorry. Now's just not the time, all right? Oh, look. There's your best friend now. I-I'm sorry. KYLE: Thanks. Using my place would have been awkward. No, nobody will. Not even if they knew who owned it. No. No, he'll be much more cooperative now. Besides, I'm running another plan on a parallel track just in case. Yeah, gotta go. Later. Here it is. There are three teams left. We'll help you get rid of those girls tomorrow, and you be ready to do a little something for us if we should need it. Like what? Like something that'll guarantee you win this contest. Sweet. But they have all these strict rules, and if I get caught shafting anyone, I'll be-- (LAUGHTER) (SPLASH) DENNIS: I'm gonna kill you guys! ♪ Everyone's talking just to fill some space ♪ ♪ And everything's nothing ♪ Till it means heartbreak ♪ Words without power ♪ Just evaporate ♪ Don't want to hear it today ♪ Achoo! ♪ Today ♪ Hello, hello ♪ This is my voice ♪ Hello, hello ♪ Hello ♪ Through the white noise (CROWD GASPS) ♪ Words only hurt (LAUGHS) ♪ When you let them matter ♪ Don't let them matter ♪ It's only chatter ♪ White noise Look sympathetic. ♪ Words only hurt Inna? ♪ When you let them matter ♪ Don't let them matter Where is she?

(APPLAUSE) Next up is that wonderful trio of cousins, Anya, Inna and Lada. Girls, come on out. Girls? Girls? (GIGGLES) RIP: We're still missing a contestant. Baby, I've never believed in love at first sight... We're still missing a contestant. until now. (CRYING) Shh. RIP: Inna? (SOBBING) Inna Bartosh, last call. Last call. (SHUSHING) Unfortunately, according to the contest rules, we must regretfully say goodbye to the Bartosh cousins. (GROANING, APPLAUSE) And while Team Tommy's performance was way off tonight, they have still earned enough points from previous episodes to make it into tomorrow's final showdown. Tommy, Philip, get that spark back. Matt was the only one who kept his cool and kept your team alive tonight. Poor kid. He did his best to help. Hey, I should go spend some time with him. I'll call you in the morning. Okay. Matt, thanks for keeping things going tonight. Uh, I was thinking maybe we could all go back to my place, you know, and practice for... Hanging with friends tonight. (DOOR SLAMS) (MUSIC PLAYING) What are you still doing here? You... said we were going to-- All right, well, I changed my mind. We should strategize. Do you want to be team captain? Do you? We just had an off night. I am so sick of "we," all right? I need to just-- (KNOCK ON DOOR) Called it about Matt and his brother! The second that Matt walked onstage-- Actually, Matt was the only person who didn't screw things up out there, so... Something was weird, though. His brother kept looking over at this other guy. Somebody told me who he was, so I Googled him. Turns out he owns-- I don't care, all right? I--I need to get home. But you have to hear this! Look, I know you're upset, and I don't know what's going on with you and Matt, but the connection between this and... I don't know what's going on with Matt either, but, you know, maybe it has to do with, um, people sticking their noses in places where they don't belong. Meaning what? Meaning everything was going fine, all right, until Matt's buddy and you decided to go looking for trouble, and now--now it seems that everything's just falling apart. What? Whoa. Okay, hold on a second. I am just trying to help you out here. Maybe you're, you know, more of a drama queen than a--a blogger. You know, likes to stir stuff up and then make sure her own gossip comes true? Right. I think... you need to-- Be left alone? Yeah, Philip. Y-You're 100% on that one, so if you can just leave? Please? God. I'm in big trouble. I don't care about what happened out there tonight. I--I thought with everybody so off their game, I could just play it straight, and we'd lose anyway. I did--That way, no one could tag me for sabotaging-- Whatever! Tomorrow night's do or die for me. I need you to come through. No more runaround. Forget what's happened. Let's just get this done. What kind of trouble, Kyle? No, bro. All I've ever done is protect you. I can't change now. Better you not know. But I--I need to know I can trust you to... (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) Uhh. What now? Hey, wait for me in the car. I gotta deal with this. Hey, I got a plan for tomorrow night, foolproof. Thanks. It's good to be a team again. Yeah? JOE: There already. I broke every speed limit. I didn't have to break in. The back door was unlocked. You sure about me leaving-- Uh-huh. Traitor just lied to my face. He needs to learn loyalty. And after he's expelled, you'll be the man on the swim team. (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) TOMMY: Where am I gonna find two... GRAN: Friends? (BOYS LAUGHING) MATT: Night, buddy. JOE: You don't get it. Your whole friendship has been a joke. He laughs at you behind your back. The joke's over. (MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, have you seen my hat?

(SIGHS) ♪ I wish I had a ♪ Wishing well ♪ Then all my dreams ♪ Could come real (STATIC BUZZES) MATT: I come up to see her whenever I can. TOMMY: Can I, uh-- Would you like me to come in with you? No, but next time, though. T, I'm so sorry. Why? What did you do to her? What? You worthless piece of garbage! Get out! Get out! Get out of here, you two-faced lying scumbag! GRAN: Tommy! Tommy! I don't think he had anything to do with this any more than you do. Deep down... there is an answer, but w-we just don't know what it is yet. I do know why you entered the contest, though. There was a letter from the landlord when I got home last night. I can still win this. I mean, I'm the best chef up there. Bello, bello, what you did was--was wonderful, and I'll always cherish how you wanted to take care of everything by yourself, but this is our problem to fix, not yours alone. We're--We're a team, just like you're part of a team in this contest. It's not about being the best chef or--or winning or saving the day by yourself. Well, besides you, I can only trust me to take care of-- No, you have to stop acting like you're on your own, because you're not. You are connected to everyone on your team-- But Matt's swimming buddy told me that Matt thinks this whole thing is just a huge joke and-- And your team is in the final round, hmm? I like Matt's sense of humor. But he's been lying this whole time. You don't know that. You don't know what he's been doing until you hear it from him. I don't know about you, but I'd like to hear what your teammate has to say. Why don't we give him a chance? Hey! Abby and I are back together for good! Yo, Matty! MATT: I told you I'm fine, and we're set. I'll be heading over to Tommy's to pick up the pizzelle dough, and I've already got the extra ingredient. You seem totally okay with all this. You're my brother. I don't want anything to happen to you. And the more I think about how he set me up, I can't wait to burn him. And you haven't heard from Dolen yet? No. Wasn't expecting to. Why? No reason. Hey, Matty... I knew you'd come through. Things are gonna be getting a lot better. Stuff I'll tell you about later with me and Abby. Let's just get through tonight. Get through? All the good stuff starts tonight. See you there. Ready to go through with our plan? (LINE RINGS) I should be the one to refrigerate the dough at the studio, just in case Kyle's gone totally overboard and has video surveillance or something like that. With all this who's bluffing who between you and your brother, how do I know you're not just bluffing me? I guess you just gotta trust me. Thanks, Gran. Moonlight's pretty bright for daytime. And... we have a restaurant to save. Joey, it's Kyle. Listen, as much as I want to trust Matty, I just don't. He's supposed to put the liquid laxative into Team Tommy's pizzelle dough before the show, but he was way too agreeable. I think he's gonna double-cross me again, so those two little kids from Team Doofus are gonna take care of it. And now I've got something I need you to handle. Call me. Look, just give me five minutes, all right? After 30 seconds of nonstop apologizing and groveling, I have to tell you the most incredible story that you have to post on your blog after tonight's show. Okay, but only if you tell me the story in 30 seconds and spend the rest of the time apologizing and groveling. (LAUGHS) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. The "Teen Chef" final showdown will begin momentarily. It turns out I need a new prescription anyway. You guys saved me some serious eyestrain. All right, let's go. Make you guys look poor, "Oliver Twist" effect. Awesome. Let's go. You kidding me? Come on. 231, 232, 233, 234. Buddy, uh, the girls aren't here anymore. I just... love the way I'm starting to look. ANNOUNCER: Mealtime Network proudly presents the "Teen Chef" final showdown. And now here's your host, Rip Barker! (APPLAUSE) Our teams will present their meals in courses to our judges, who will score and evaluate each meal progressively until we're down to dessert and the selection of the new Mealtime Network champions. Gentlemen, start your enchiladas. ♪ Time's up, and the light is fading fast ♪ ♪ This time, nothing's gonna hold me back ♪ ♪ Darkness can't overtake me ♪ ♪ My eyes are open, and I see ♪ ♪ The pools around me throw some light ♪ ♪ That's where ♪ That's where hope begins (LAUGHTER) ♪ I know that life is too crazy ♪ ♪ To drive me insane ♪ And when I'm sinking ♪ I'm thinking I'm used to the pain ♪ ♪ When waves are crashing me up ♪ ♪ And they're testing my will ♪ ♪ I'll face them down ♪ It's just a spill ♪ Yeah ♪ I don't drown ♪ I just get wet ♪ Water's up above my head ♪ I won't drown ♪ I'm not done yet... While our judges take a breather, our contestants will now prepare their final dessert round. (APPLAUSE) Team captains, join your sous-chefs. (APPLAUSE) Stop! (AUDIENCE GASPING) That dough's no good! Let's go to a commercial break. We'll be right back. He told me he messed with his dough to sabotage him. My producer's telling me we won't be going to commercial break. Sweeps week. Nice try, pal, but this dough is fine. JOE: No, I mean it. He put enough liquid laxatives in there to suck out the judges' small intestines. (AUDIENCE GASPING) WILL: It's true. Otto and I saw him put something in the dough today. No, he didn't, all right? It's fine. I trust Matt completely. Thank you. Me, too! He's my brother! He'd never do anything like that! If there's any chance that anyone-- Test it! I want that dough tested now. I vouch for Matty's integrity. We'd like to thank the producers of "Cooking with Zayde" for allowing us to continue with our extended live show. They'll return next week. Our news isn't good. It appears that Team Tommy's pizzelle dough was in fact tainted. (AUDIENCE GASPS) And so now-- "Any interference with ingredients "or procedures disqualifies the team whose member did said interfering." Thank you. But the rules go on to say that, if the team captain decides to dismiss the offending individual from the team, they can go on to redo the round in question. Tommy, you have a decision to make. You and Dennis can go head to head in another dessert round, but only if you fire Matt from your team. (GASPING, MURMURING) RIP: What's it gonna be? I--We're a team. RIP: Okay, but just so you make a fully informed decision, going into this last round, Team Tommy was in the lead. You may want to take a minute. Win or lose, we're a team. So the winner of the Mealtime Network contest is Team Dennis! (APPLAUSE, GROANING) We're out of time now, but we'd like-- Thank you so much! I just want to say how honored I am. Where do I begin? I have my own show now. We here at the Mealtime Network would like to invite all of our contestants and our in-studio audience to join us tomorrow for a very special afternoon edition of our show live from the beautiful lake house of our network owner, where we will thank all of our contestants and officially welcome Team Dennis to our TV family immediately following "Brunhilde's Biscuits." Thank you, and good night. (APPLAUSE) DIRECTOR: And we're out. I'll interview both of you after the ceremony tomorrow. MATT: I taught him everything he knows. (LAUGHS) Dude! It's your speech. You two are gonna resign from the team today. I'll keep you to help behind the scenes, but, uh, in the fan email that I've gotten since last night, it doesn't seem like a good idea to... split our audience's focus among all of us. Ooh! TOMMY: Even though I'm bummed about losing my dream of saving the pizza parlor, I realize that, if this had all happened a month ago, I would have bailed on coming here today. I would have just curled up and disappeared under the radar, but I'm not. I'm here now with my teammates, and no one can break us. And what I'm hearing from this kid, it seems like we're not the only ones who have been pushed too far. Sounds like this one's pushing back. ANNOUNCER: "Teen Chef" continues live. Never mind that we're not even really urban poor kids. Our mom's the live-in help for his family. Well, was, I guess, after today. But our team is not the rightful winner of this contest, and aside from me, there are three guys who made Team Tommy lose-- him... (GASPING) BOY: What? him... and especially him. (CHUCKLING) Here's how it all went down. (MUSIC PLAYING) And that's it. I'm really, really sorry for my part in this, but I want you to know that my brother didn't have anything to do with it. My brother says, "Yes, I did..." "and we're a team, too." (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHS) Ladies and gentlemen, the real winners of the Mealtime contest, Team Tommy! (CHEERING) Congratulations, Matt and Tommy. What are you gonna do with your prize money? I--I hear there's this great old pizza restaurant for sale. (LAUGHS) Awesome. Hey, maybe you can tape your new TV show from there. Yeah! Sounds good to me. (CHEERING) Ladies and gentlemen, more with Team Tommy right after this short break. NED: Mm. As you may have guessed, the demolition's off. And as far as any future work goes, why don't you move to Antarctica? Let's hear from our winners. Um, thank you, everyone. Um, our... (SLAPPING) Ow! Ow! Ow! (LAUGHING) Ow! Hey. (GROANS) Relax, bro. It'll only sting, like, a week. Or six! Ah, ah, ah, hey. (LAUGHTER) When I'm ready, I'll walk home. So, T, finish your speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! (CHANTING) Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! (CHEERING) Uh, boy, it's getting pretty hot out here. Sure is. Yee-hoo! Uh, team swim!

They're the keepers, you know, the ones who will always be on your team no matter what. It also helps to stay strong when things get tough. Always remember those people in your life who care about you, and move on from the ones who never will, and be cool with taking the help and the friendship of those keepers. Beats flying solo.
