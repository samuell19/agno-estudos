Hello, Kiarra Saint-Jean, I'm here to pick up Maxence. Hello. Are you Mrs Saint-Jean? Yes, I'm Kira. Nice to meet you. Maxence. We're going down, she's coming. You can take them. Yes. But by the edges, because in the middle there are traces of invisible pigments. Yes, it's old. It's been 50,000 years. Really? It comes from my great-grandfather. He ran the Musée de l'Homme. You know it was a bit fashionable before? He wore his necklace in a diamond. Maybe even in a earrings like that. Hello. Hello, madam. I made you a coffee as I was leaving. Thank you. It's nice to have you back. So, on our side, it's not good enough, but I'll let you check. Thank you. Anyway, we haven't changed anything compared to what you received by email. Are the lockers heavy? A little, but when you have the hand, it's fine. Do you think he'll get by? No, stop. You know he got tired of his apprenticeship last year. Yes, I told him right away when I met Mr. Saint-Jean. I work at a farm, it didn't suit me. There you go. I hope it will suit you. Well, I'm going to get my bag. You're Italian? I'm Belgian, but my parents are Italian. How long have you been in France? 15 years. No, 18, 19. I don't remember. 18, 19? That's a long time. It hurts. Let's hurry. ... plus the sea and the floods. Forecast for Monday night, violent winds from the south-west, 50 to 60 knots, gusts of 75 to 80 knots, very big seas, 980 hectopascals in the south, visibility 2000, falling to 0.5 miles during the night. We're here. At least it's clear. Are you OK? Don't look at the sea! Breathe! Great, a crossroad, already written. How are you, Maxence? It was a bit hard to cross. It's better already. I'm cutting the water. Please. Watch out! Be careful with the door. Don't put your feet in there. Sorry, I'm disturbing you. As long as you're playing well. I'd play better if I was used to the room. Why? It sounds a bit stupid, but it's true. I'm sorry, it's a bit of a mess, but we only have one room. No, but it's... We'll try to find you something else. No, it's fine. It's fine. It's going to be fine. We'll eat in an hour. Thanks. There's no room on the Zenith website. How much do you think a Paracom's costs? I don't know. I'm sure he has a housekeeper. He must have a gardener. I'm sure he has someone for everything. Only guys who sell their place for 300 euros... can read. There'll be a lot of money. Max doesn't know how to do it. So? I hope we're not a bunch of little bourgeois. Yes. I'm coming. I like your hair. Really? Do you like my hair? Voilà. It's a ladder and the boss who are... Hello. Hi. You're going to defend us. You're hungry, right? Yes, we're all hungry. No, I'm not saying anything. The problem with the Dutch is that it's urgent. It's good to go fishing in the UK... You're having coffee? Yes, please. What are you doing? Regional deliques. With two other guys, they'll represent the French fishermen during the Brexit negotiations. He's already gone to London and Brussels. He'll probably go back to England to negotiate. Really? It's no use. You know how it is in your country. It won't be long before it's over. I'm sure it'll be over soon. Very good. Good luck. Yeah, it's a very good idea. Don't run! Hey, Calo. You've been a real pleasure. We were worried. We weren't on our best. Hi, how are you? Hi, Kira. Samuel, Maxence, our new apprentice. Hi. Did you get everything? We managed to get everything. And you? Only two thirds. Luckily, there's Maxence. Oli, I'm leaving your cave. I'm coming. I'm making pizza. You've known each other forever. She's a fisherman's daughter. We went to school together. It wasn't hard. I was a merchant's wife. How old were you? I was 15. You left early. I came back when I was 41. I had 36. I was a seaman. She died 3 years later. What are you doing? Yes. Why did you open it? I don't know. What's this? Come on. Go. Go get a hot water. Go on, you've got blue eyes. Go on, don't bother me. It's OK. Don't tremble. You're rubbing. It's purple now. It's your fault. I'm going to the kitchen. It's dead, anyway. Couldn't we get some diving bottles? Where? You must have gone miles. Hello? No, not much. We're in the 4,000 euros. We found only this house. We were expecting you. Two weeks. It's better to go and pick them up tonight. I'll kiss you later. These toys are so cute. OK, our turn. If we cheat, it doesn't work. We're cursed. Grey-haired spirit, are you there? You're the one who's making it move. No, not at all. It's her who's making it move. It's moving again. The light's back on. Can you bring us home? No, your dad will come and get you. Why are you keeping us? I don't know. Figure it out. Come in. Hello, Mrs Bonin. I'm all alone. Am I disturbing you? What a storm! It was a heavy one. I'm cold. Come in. I've got a root-cutting tree. Oh, yeah. I've got it badly cut. It's not holding up? Sit down. I wonder if that's what cut the electricity. Because... I went to see the counter. It looked fine. Want some tea? I'll warm up. Thank you. You're so nice. I didn't take anything this morning. We're used to comfort. And then we're excited. No, Gaëlle! That's silly. It's a joke. I'll be back. Yes, please. Beatrice and Tony, you are going to commit yourselves to each other in marriage. Will you do it freely and without any constraints? Yes. By committing yourselves in the marriage, you are promising mutual love and respect. Will you do it for the rest of your lives? Yes. I now leave you to discuss your preferences. He's stressed out again. Are you ready? There are people here. You're cheating. In happiness and in trials, in health and in illness, and to love you every day of my life. I now invite you to rise for the benefit of the audience. Thank you very much, Claude. First of all, I hope you like potatoes and ham. Because, as you all know, dad only eats that. Although I wonder if you haven't changed your diet lately. Yeah... Because jeans are starting to get a little tight, in terms of size, dad. No, but if you're really good at sewing, you might even be able to make him his next costume for his next costume party. Oh, Zorro's costume, you're going to love it! I'm the knight! Yeah, yeah... I hope you're ready to put up with your friends too. Antoine, Samuel, everyone. When all the sick people come home for an aperitif that ends at 6am, I can tell you that... I think you're not ready, really. Yes, because at first it's good, but then it gets tough, you see. When are you getting married? Well, then I also hope that... It's only six months after our meeting. We got married so I could have my papers and vote. I really love you, you're a fucking bitch! Yeah, there's nothing shameful about it. It's useless to be mean to a woman. Take a little bite. Bah! Don't overdo it, I made them. I don't eat what stinks. It's you who stinks! Yeah, yeah... Here, take some time. Me, then? Thank you. You're well-raised, not like your boss. We met at a fairytale. She was working and I kidnapped her, like a pirate. You were working on a fairytale? Yeah. One morning I was vacuuming and he was blocking the way and sleeping in the closet. I was vacuuming his face so he could move. Our first success. No, I'm done with that. It's by doing my studies on the continent that I realized that there are elegant men in this world. No, no, seriously. I think it's great that you're so happy and in love. I sincerely believe that Béatrice fell for... I'm kidding, but... For the best man... That he is. And as you know, I... All my life I was head to head with my father, in the end. And I can guarantee you that it's a great company and... And you're lucky. Thank you, my girl. Thank you. There you go. Bravo! Who's turn is it now? Next! Well, Cara, I think it's your turn now! Tony, 19 years ago I fell in love with Antoine and I decided to follow him on this lost rock at the end of the world at the end of the world some would say in the hole of the ass of the world and in the hole of the ass of the world the first face I saw was yours you scared me a little at first with your uncomfortable look but you were welcoming and delicate you're Antoine's best friend but I think you're mine too after 30 years of sailing you have the spirit of the sea on the water you have to lend assistance to anyone, anytime even to a stranger like me I don't forget that finally I never went back to Belgium because my life is here and my real family is the one I chose and today the family has a new member, Beatrice whom I will welcome as you welcomed me I wish you to be very very happy So, what is Nina's second name? What are these stupid questions? Do something a little simpler. Wait, let me talk! I'm going crazy for the second question! But because you have one of the most interesting questions. Well yes, let's go straight to the point. Come on, go ahead. How many guys did I sleep with in your life? Oh, there you go! How many figures? 12, 12, 12! No, but she's just having fun. To three figures! 20? 20? So, tell us! Oh, you're crazy! No, but wait! It's your turn, Mr. Bertilien. Oh, it's going to be fine! Pepelino! Come on, drink your juice. What do I have? You guessed well. By the way, it's my turn. Are you ready? Are you ready? How many dates did I have before sleeping with Tony? Ah, zero! Go ahead! One! Lost! It's a mythical creature! You disgust me! Drink a little glass. I don't want to drink anymore. What is it? It's my turn. What is my astrological sign? Capricorn! No, no, no, I know! You're a fish, aren't you? So, it's not a virgin, that's for sure. Oh, the Lourdes! No, it's easy, you're a taurus, Conny. Oh, that's it! Everyone says that, Conny. No, I'm a lion. We lost. Come on, drink. You lost, drink. Come on, come on, come on. It's your third board game, look. It's your wedding, it's over. Well, go ahead, go ahead. What's my favorite color? Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Let's go? Let's go. Yeah.

No, I'm the one who's smoking. I'm so drunk, you're pissing me off. What did I do to you? You're charming everyone. You're playing the charming. You bourgeois. You're a bourgeois. Stop it, I don't want you to do that with me. I'm not doing anything with you. I'm not doing anything. I'll show you something. Come, I'll feed you. So? Follow me. No, come back! Maxence! Maxence?

Try this on. It'll suit you. No. How old are you? 45, why? No, no. You'll see how old you are here. No rules. I don't like dressing up. Please. Well, especially because I don't have any support yet. Come on. Come on! Don't look at me. You're fine. You're beautiful. Stop. Nothing happens, okay? I'll go out first. I just wanted you to go to bed. Are you OK? I'll send a room to Tony for Maxence. You're fed up with him? Good luck to you both! What are you fishing? Perlans. Is it dead? A little. A tourist told us it's a kilo for lunch, and he'll give us 10 euros. We've got about 30. You'll be rich. Don't worry, we'll help you instead of staring at us. Insolent. Hi. Hi, Antoine. You're cute with your suitcase. Here, Mr. Le Maire and his assistant. Hi, guys. Hi. How long are you away? Two weeks. Don't sleep in front of the English. Kiss them before they kiss us. Yeah, OK. Well... Shit for the Negros. Come on. I'm going. I'll miss my Ferry. It'll be a pain. Thanks. Can you take care of the lockers? I'll do it myself. Sure? They're in bad shape. I'll take care of them. As you wish. It'll be more efficient. See you tomorrow. Yes? Hello. How are you? I'm fine. Can I come in? Of course. I didn't know you were here. I'm on vacation. Who is it? I just got back. Aren't you working today? No, we had a day off. Antoine just left for England. Oh, OK. For the business, you know. Yeah, I know. Well, no, I didn't know. Here, my perfume. I got you a little present. What is it? Nothing. It's not hard to guess. Chocolate. Chocolate! What a surprise! Why do you want chocolate? It was for Béatrice, but she's allergic, I thought of you. Oh, okay. You don't like chocolate? Yes, yes. There you go. Don't thank me. I don't know if they're good. I hope they're good. Honestly... Are you okay? Wait. Wait. Wait. You're all wet. It's disgusting. Yeah, it's disgusting. I ate poop everywhere. I'm glad to see you, anyway. Really? Yeah. Can I make you one? Yeah, thanks. What do you want? Like you, it's fine. Well... You haven't eaten, have you? Are you depressed? Come. Wow! At this level, he's a genius. You know, you really have to settle in. How? You can delete the paintings, put up posters... No, I like them. Look. Look, this one's a Turner. It's beautiful. You don't like it? I don't think we have the same taste. I don't find your Turner particularly beautiful. What do you like about a painting like that? What do I like about your painting? Like, the joconde. Oh, yes. It's got something. It's a bit like me. I look a bit like the joconde, don't I? Yes, a little bit, that's true. That's true. But you're a little cuter, with your little curls. You want to sleep here? I haven't thought about it yet. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. OK. As you wish. It's a decision for both of us. Listen, I'm fine with it. If you're fine with it, I'm fine with it. You're fine with it? I mean, I'm... If you want to sleep here, you can. You have someone else. What? You're in a relationship. Not at all. You're not saying it, but you're in a relationship. I'm not in a relationship. Yes, you are. I said I wasn't. You can tell me. I'm not in a relationship. Are you? No, I'm not. Seriously, I'm not. Really? No. I'm not going to bother. OK, it's decided. With who knows who. With who knows who. No, I'm just thinking about it with a guy. I don't give a shit. I understand. I understand. But you're in love, Jean. Yes, I can feel it. Maybe it's better not to talk about it. It's life. Ok, it's good. It's perfect, you don't need us anymore. What's going on? I think it's happening! What are you doing? I think it's happening! Yara! Wait, turn around! Turn around! You think it's funny? Are you scared? Of course I'm scared! I don't want to wake people up like this. But it's dark. No, but it's dark. Oh yeah, it's the English apples, you know. You drink, you eat, you... You never stop. How's business? It's laborious. I'm exhausted. Everyone is saying we have time, 2026, blah blah blah... And at the same time, everyone says the agreement can't last like this. But hey, the positions are getting harder. I don't know what it's going to be. You look pretty fit. But we made a big mess. There's a Dano, we took him with us, there were only fishermen and him. The guy, he has a descent, he's going to swing us all. It's a crazy thing. So, politics. And you, how are you? Yeah. Do you have everything you want to tell? Well, yes, I have less to tell than you. Oh yeah, Dominique asked me if we could share the treasure to amortize the damage from the storm. Yeah, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. Anyway, we need a physical agent to decide that, you see. So we really have to be all here. It's not possible to work alone. You're right. I really need to go to bed. Okay. I miss you. I miss you too. Bye, I'll kiss you. Bye. Hi, how are you? I told your dad. I think he's putting me upside down. Thanks. Hi. Bye-bye. How are you? Fine. No, I'm not fine. You're not going to a party? I've got my own rules. They've decided to go on vacation. Always at the wrong time. You're not finished, darling. You know that. Hello. You're here, Maxence? You were up at this time? I wasn't sleeping. What a big lie! Where are you going? I'm going swimming. What? Why are you hiding? I'm not hiding. You're beautiful. More commonplace? No. On the contrary. Once you've worked, you have strong shoulders. You have incredible legs. And there's a little hollow at the bottom of the neck. It's fibrous. There's nothing you can't have. No, there's nothing. A little bit. Yes! Subtitling TITRAFILM I'm going to swim anyway. I'm coming! Yes? Yes? I'm coming! I don't know, maybe I put it in my head. In my head, I see that mine is lower than yours. You've got a crack there too. You didn't notice, maybe? No, I didn't notice. I saw a TV show called... Stéphane Bern, who was talking about the cemetery of the innocent. It was about the corpses that were buried. It gives juice, and the earth softens. It's good that it's also overflowing. No one was buried here. In the village, they say they buried their rabbits, their cats, their dogs, and everything. I think my wall has crumbled in a year. That's why I wanted to see if yours is... No, it's fine. I don't know. Maybe we should ask your husband. He could give us an explanation. He's not here. You've got a good mine. You're so beautiful. Thank you. You are. You've got a good mine too. You look fit. I'm bothering you. We won't talk about the wall all night. I'd like a coffee, though. Well... I'm busy. I'm doing the laundry. I'm bothering you. I'll have to come back. She's gone. I can't stand it anymore. What are you doing? I'm going to swim. Are you going back to Tony's? I don't know. See you soon! Come here. You got a minute? No, I've got a meeting. You got something to say? I don't want to talk. Why not? You're very suspicious. What? I'm not going to draw you. Aren't you ashamed? My God! They say all the crap about the port. What are they saying? You should know, shit! Some people hear such nonsense. They say all the crap. They're not. He's a kid. He sleeps upstairs. He slept on the couch. I don't believe you. It's a lie. You're a liar. You think I don't know what's going on? He's a kid. What's going on in your head? You've only had one wife. Where were your ex-girlfriends? At the camp? Singapore? It wasn't a problem. I'm not going to justify myself. You're the one who's talking. Antoine's my best friend. That's all. I'm not counting. It's not the same. I'm sorry. Come on! Get down, girls. It's dangerous. Come on. Hey, that's not funny! It can hurt! Enzo, let it go. Let it go, I'm telling you. You think it's funny? It's funny, but it's a bit funny. I'm not funny? You're trying to scare me? I'm not scared. We're just walking around. So, is Maxence's dick fresh? You want me to tell your mum? She'll be mad. You! What are you doing? Get off the horse! You're hurting him! What are you doing? What are you doing? You're hurting him! Are you OK? Are you OK? Where? He's fine. Are you OK? Who did that? Was it you? Apologise. Apologise! As long as you come here. What will you do when Antoine comes back? Maybe we'll talk about it, right? I don't want to dip his nose in it. Come on, it's over. What do you want, really? Don't look at me like that! I love you, but you're bothered. It's true, whenever you want. We fuck once, then we don't care, then we fuck again, it's for the lady's pleasure, right? What do you expect from me? What do you want me to do? I've got my whole life here. It's easy for you to say I love you, but it's your age. Stop saying bullshit, you idiot, with your shitty accent. You want me to talk about it? Who do you think you are? No courage, Gera. No courage. Get out! Get out! I'm leaving, okay? If you mess with Anton, you tell him you fired me or whatever. Maxence, let's go down. I don't want to humiliate myself. Hi, how are you? Hi, yeah. Where are you going? I'm taking a vacation. Oh, yeah? Where are you going? I don't know, it's not very organized yet. See you later. Yeah, bye. Hello. Sorry, I'm late. I'm leaving. Who's late? Are you OK? I'm a bit... It's normal. Hello, Master Robert. Hello, Master. That's it. He's on the phone. He's coming. Excuse me. Hello, madam. Hello, sir. Good. We will now sign your Divorce by Mutual Consent Convention, which you received three weeks ago. The deadline is 15 days. Is that clear? Yes. Good. So, Mrs Maertens-Chiara, born 1 May 1977 in Lessines, Belgium, Mrs Paulina Maertens, born Gengini, and Mr Philippe Maertens. Mrs Maertens is currently unemployed, but is a professional sailor. I just found a crew. Mr Saint-Jean-Antoine, born 9 April 1974 in Brest, Mrs Sandrine Saint-Jean-Neroux, and Mr Patrick Saint-Jean. Mr Saint-Jean is also a professional sailor. Yes. The two married on 16 June 2003 in Laferte-en-Lille. Thank you. How did you choose your lawyer? On the Internet. She was very nice. And you? Tony advised me. To do my best? Yes. To pronounce your name well. He couldn't say Mertens. No, he said Martens. Mrs. Martens. Is your station far? Over there, on the last car park. I can give you a lift if you want. I'd like you to tell me. No, it'll be a pain. What did you do in three months? Walked, moved? You fucked like rabbits and went to Stade? No, we travelled. I've never been so happy. I understand it's hard to hear in a nightclub. You're crazy to be on the roof. What? There's no half-way. You do what you want. You've always done it. Do you miss it? Not really. We lived what we had to live. We didn't want to do anything else. Do you remember the first time we came to the island? I was so proud you came with me. I can't say I didn't love you anymore. I loved you both, not for the same reasons. If I could, I'd have kept you both. I'll stop right here. Come on, let's go. He's going to come in. Thank you.
