Thousands and thousands of secrets will be unveiled When that secret face reveals itself You ask me to tell a story. Sure. Let me tell a story. But I'm not sure if I'd be able to bare my heart. Whenever I'm asked to tell a story, I think of trees. THE CITY OF CITIES The trees in my dream. Once upon a time, I told a story. I bared my heart. But I was not the only one telling a story. Everybody was telling a story. I don't know why... but I was dreaming of trees. But I was young back then. No. I am not a lad anymore. SECRET FACE My adolescence is long gone now. Ceased at the beginning of the story which I'm about to tell. I was young back then. I was fervent. I rebelled against my father. My mind was fixed on studying in Istanbul. To tell the truth, firstly on Istanbul, then on studying. I didn't listen to my father and left. He then cut my pocket money. I found this job with help of a relative. I wouldn't have thought of honky-tonk photographer as a profession. I thought we'd make peace with my father in six months at most. No. After six months, not my father... but a mysterious man called me. This man, whom I learnt to be a butler later on... Took me to a house in the back alleys of the city. There, a woman... A beautiful and elegant woman. She wanted me to bring the photos I took at honky-tonks, night clubs. Every morning. She didn't say why she wanted the photos. She offered a fair sum of money. I accepted. After I took photos all night long and developed them... I would take a nap in my small room towards morning and... then I'd hit the road. In the hazy mornings while the city was just waking up, I'd walk under bare chestnut trees and... I would think what she was looking for in the photos. It went on for two years. Every morning, she'd seize the photos and sit at her table... and would take her time to watch the faces at length. The only think I knew of her was... a childhood photo of her taken with her father. Years later, I realized what she was looking for. The face of this man is so empty and so pitiful... that you understand right away. He'd have three children. Children fight with each other day and night. The man dreams a house with garden. Is there any other photo of this man? That's all there is. What else? None. I didn't take any other. Why? It's a face like any other. Not at all. His face tells a story. My dad used to say a meaningful face always tells a story. Who is that man? I don't know. But I feel as if I've known him for years. Can you find him for me? I know the waiter. I'll ask him. Do take more photos of him. I want to be sure that it's him. Ask him what he wants most in life. Ask him what he sees in his dreams. Ask him whether his dreams are concluded or not. Or does he forget them? Are faces in his dreams wiped away or tangled? Does he remember them? Is he able to be himself? You're using a straight razor. I tried safety razor once... I thought someone else's face will appear under foam. I haven't given up on my straight razor for thirty-five years. It has never betrayed me as well. Look! My own face appears from beneath. You know him? No. What about him? Why do you ask? He is a fellow countryman of my wife. - He's a driver at a municipality bus. - Which line? Ey?p - Emin?n?. You've taken this. I'm looking for this friend. - He forgot his wallet. - Could be true, he is absent minded. He's clockmaker. Where is his shop? I'll show you when we approach to the stop. Well... May it always show happy hours to you. - It works! - Does it also make its old sound? Exactly the same! Welcome. Can you take a look at this? - What's wrong with it? - It has a problem but I don't know. I thought clocks wouldn't break down anymore. Why? Clocks are not manmade anymore. But it seems yours is manmade. Look, it works. Listen. Zemberek kurtulmus BB How did you know that it had something wrong? I felt so. It made me uneasy. If everybody'd felt that much... the world would have been a totally different universe. I will put a part nobody would think of into the heart of your clock. Now on, neither you nor your clock will ever be uneasy. To be at peace... Must one work in a shop like this? The secret isn't inside the shop, but inside clocks. What's that secret? I don't know exactly. But I close the shop and return home. The house would be in silence. So silent that... I feel as if I could hear ticktacks of the clocks in the shop. After I close down the shop and take down the shutters... I think clocks run like clockwork in the dark. All in an empty... and dark shop. At once. It's this idea that makes me uneasy, young man. It's done. How much do I owe? In life... what would you like to happen most? I'd like to tell people about clocks. The delicacy of their mechanisms. The dreadfulness of their bows. The darkness of the wheels. Nowadays, nobody is aware of what a clock is. Maybe that's why people are sorrowful. Maybe that's why... they cannot even tell their own story. They don't know what spirit lays behind the hour and minute hands. I'd be able to tell people the secret of clocks. They would then awaken to the world as if from a long sleep. They'd get rid of their sorrow. Maybe they would be able to tell their stories. Thanks. I knew he was a clockmaker. Only a clockmaker has a face this strange and surprising. This face has everything. Sorrow, fear, love. A map. I wasn't mistaken. It's not your type. Tell me his dreams once more. He said he'd like to tell people of clocks. People would then be redeemeed of their sorrow and... and tell their stories. Tell it in his words. It was as if he didn't have his own words. There are some people... who tell stories to you. When you return home, you'd be full of these stories. But you can't remember a single word from them. Oh, what beautiful things I see in my dreams. But I can't remember a single of them when I wake up. The only ones I remember are these. A mirror, a lamp and an iron. How was his smile? - Whose smile? - The clockmaker's. Sorrowful. Sorrowful, isn't he? Take me to him. There are other photos as well. Won't you have a look at them? We together have been searching for two years. Now, take me to him. Please. Now? Yes. Now. He's not the one you're looking for. My dad hung it. It protects me. Because he knew I'll be looking with this car... for a face exactly twenty years later. My dad always used to tell we'll return to the town. Those in the town would hang it on the beautiful Arabian horses. He wanted me to ride the horse really well. A letter arrived from home. My dad is sick. For many times... I thought I'd be able to tell you why I look at all those faces. When I look at people, I really want to tell. Then I don't want to tell all of a sudden. Which one? That one. Don't point out with your fingers. The one the woodsman just crossed. There it is. Is that him? Nope. Of course not. Are you sure it's this shop? I'm sure. I wonder how he will greet me? Hello. How are you? We'll shake hands. I'll tell my dad of him. Can you tell me about his hands once more? Talented hands. His smile? How was his smile? Sorrowful. I lost my nerve. Rag and bones! Rag and bones! Look, it's him. Here he comes. I can't see him. It's him! My dad sometimes used to get lost all of a sudden. He sometimes would be lost since we were playing together. In hope of finding him somewhere in the house, I would look for him for hours Sometimes he'd go astray without notice. At first, I'd think he was playing a game. I thought he was hiding somewhere, so he's playing. I should find him right away. My dad was tall and slim. His face was soft. His gaze was sorrowful. But he wasn't always like that. When you do something wrong, he'd knit his eyebrows and his face'd tangle. In such moments, When he was angry with me, he'd wither away. I couldn't bear with him being angry with me. Please don't be angry with me dad, I'd say. I will ride the horse better, I will grab it firmly, I will stand upright at the saddle! I can't endure when you're lost. I'd search for him for hours at home, look for him thousand times. Where are you, dad, I'd say. Show yourself! I won't do it again! It's getting dark, don't hide, I'll be how you want me to be. Don't be angry with me, please! Don't hide! The house is empty! Please! Don't cry. Don't cry. Please. I am really thirsty. Can you get me some water? Water? Water. Do you have water? - Come again? - Water! Got water? Yes. Do you know where he's gone? No. After twenty years, he packed and went away in two days. His stuff? He sold all to these rag and bones men. Closed! - Where did he go? - He vanished off the face of the earth. How are you? We'll shake hands. I'll tell him about my dad. Tell me his hands again. His smile. What is that which distinguishes one face from another? A story? A meaningful face... always tells a story. I am thirsty. Can you get me water? You have a telegram. Your father is dead. Come home. Your face is ashen. What's this noise? I can't hear any noise. My father's eyes don't close. - To close your father's eyes - Your father's eyes will be closed now. Don't you worry now. He always wanted it to be like this. All together around a table. Then you'll stay here from now on. There's a lot to do. You'll go the dairy this week. We should sell and get rid of all of it. Here they come. Let no one see you crying at the funeral. Where are his sons? Where are his sons! Get them here. Take a good look. Is this your father? Yes, he is. I couldn't hear? Come again. Yes, he's my dad. It's my father! As if my father had to be someone else. Not a father who fell in love with that strange woman. I'd convince myself. When I returned home, I'd say to myself this isn't our home. I'd thought he felt all of this and that's why you didn't return from Istanbul. I didn't know. The first time I saw the woman, I thought she was a relative of someone at the dairy. She was a teacher. Her husband as well. What's a wife of a teacher doing at the dairy anyway? My father used to tell me he was giving wood for the school. She was meticulous, she was making a clean copy of the ledger, he told me. She started to visit the dairy every day. Is this the ledger? Her handwriting is indeed beautiful. My dad didn't want me to come here. Choose. I'll leave others. Very well. - Is it you who have done that? - What? If you wonder her so much, I'll show you her on our way passing the school. If a father starts to lie, he's no more a father. Ma wants these at home. This as well. As you look at a face, you sway a dream. But a dream withers as brief as a blink. The dream is in your mind then on. But is it true? It always must be with you. Not in your mind. Else you'll be ruined. Why didn't you bring your camera with you? I don't know. Because you thought getting the dream of the town into paper has no worth, right? No. I won't go back to Istanbul. How would a mother want his son not to get education? But no mother wants her son to live out his life with taking photos of drunkards. One day, you'll go to Istanbul and finish your school and become a lawyer. But now that you stay, you'll help your brother. Now, my sons, I'll show you something. Come with me now. Put your arm inside. Put it properly. Scoop it now. Give me the key. Count it. Your brother knows. A plot, in the downtown, next to the mosque. It belongs to the sons of your dad's aunt. Been twenty years now. It seems they won't come back. If we buy now, they will sell the plot on the cheap. - Thirty seven. - Very well. Count again and put them into the purse. Your brother plans to build a shop there. You'll deal with that. Tomorrow you'll get a bus and then you'll find them and... deliver the gold. To this address. Our future depends on this purse. Don't you forget that. For years, I lived inside clocks. The course of clocks has become the secret of my life. One day, I understood this secret can be resolved by the riddle of our faces. So, my dreams tangled up with dreams of others. I won't ever forget. Because I tell now. Because if the face of the clock is close to one's heart, one's face starts to speak. - Thanks. - Goodbye. You have a minute? Yes? Is the one we watched just before yours? Why? I want to buy it. Will you sell it to me? It's a trust. I'll pay you a lot of money. I'm saying it's not mine. Its owner is in the town. Who is its owner? You'll see in a while. It's been twenty years. I am still scared to walk this road at night. Wait here. Hello. Here is the trust. - Give a second please. - Of course. Let's talk at my shop. Why do you want this so much? It's hard to explain. I know. It's hard. You've first seen this woman in your dream, right? I first saw her in one of my dreams. Then she came to my shop. In my dream, I was in a market. A market where you could find everything. Whatever you want. Bests of foods, clothes. Silk fabrics and whatnot. You know what I've seen? In one shop, they're selling lives. You pick up whatever life you like. The face of that spirit becomes your face. You live happily ever after. At the very moment I was choosing the face I want, a woman confronted me. I understood an angel she was. Clockmaker, she said, have you considered thoroughly? You're at the point of no return. I was scared. I woke up sweating. At noon, I saw that woman right across me. Here. At the shop. I was speechless. What a strange shop, she said. In such a gloomy condition. She liked and fondled that clock. This is very beautiful clock, she said. But it's broken down for it lost its spirit. Only you can fix it, she said. I said okay. I'll do it for you. She smiled. She left a wad of money. Too much money. She smiled again. And she left this. A trust, she said. Watch it and you'll remember your dreams. You'll find what you lost in your face. Let others watch as well. They will also remember. My young friend... I watched it at once. I made others watch as well. But... I didn't understand a thing. I couldn't fix the clock. Did she tell you when she'll be back? She asked when I will fix the clock. A month at the latest, I said. I am trying to fix it somehow. She said she'll come again. Take good care of thing I'm entrusting you with. She got inside a blue car in front of the shop and left. It was blue, right? Dream blue. It's obvious she appeared in your dream as well. When you saw her image, you knew her right away, right? Everybody has a secret. I don't get mixed up. But... What she left me is a trust. - If you can't afford it, don't... - I have gold coins. I'll cash them out. Show them. It'll cost you ten coins. It's full of responsibility. Okay, let's make it 9 coins. You don't know me and you didn't buy it from me. Stay for a while. Where can I find a hotel? Straight ahead. Take this as well. I'll give it dirt cheap. You'll watch it at once in your room. Many years ago, in a snowy night, my dad told me a story. Once upon a time, in a pitiful country hat everybody forgot... a little girl and her dad live all alone. Her dad loves her so much that... he wanted her to have a different life. When she's grown and became a woman, she'll find the bird behind Mount Kaf and... would break the spell which makes faces of the unfortunate as identical to each other. The little girl falls asleep listening to her dad and... she'd do all of these tasks in her dreams. But she would get sad, finding herself same again as a little girl upon waking up. I understood who that little girl was much later. When I woke up as an adult woman from my dreams in the morning. When I moved to a city under a clock tower. That's how we started to search for each other with the storytellers of sorrow. We were looking at each other's faces as maps and... we put our spirits onto the table as stories. How much longer will you stay? One or two week. I don't know. Is there any news? None. I'm trying to make up a part for this. It's not its original part but I hope it will make it work. Why don't you sit down? What time did she come at that day? Sometime between 12 and 1 pm. Did she tell you where she came from? A city? Where there's a clock tower? She didn't tell. How does one pass time in a town? You can't pass it. You wait to pass time until your death. Let me clean the room. Let it stay like that. When I woke up as an adult woman from my dreams in the morning. When I moved to a city under a clock tower. Well, that's how we started to search for each other with the storytellers of sorrow. We were looking at each other's faces as maps and... we put our spirits onto the table as stories. She'd find the bird behind Mount Kaf and... break the spell which makes faces of the unfortunate as identical to each other. The little girl falls asleep listening to these stories and... she'd do all of these tasks in her dreams. But she would get sad, finding herself same again as a little girl upon waking up. I understood who that little girl was much later. When I woke up as an adult woman from my dreams in the morning. When I moved to a city under a clock tower. I fixed the clock. We were looking at each other's faces as maps and... we put our spirits onto the table as stories. I lived within clocks for years. The course of clocks has become the secret of my life. How did you do it? Here you go, I made something up. She'll take care the rest. I don't get it. She didn't come for a month now. A month and four days. I'd get impatient when the clock shows twelve or one. close to one's heart, one's face starts to speak. She said she'll be back again. She'll come back as if getting out from a dream. What's the reason behind it all? No one's able to understand. Visions... Dreams... Clocks... Don't you have a family? I have. They're waiting for me. Let's stroll around for a while. There are some friends. Come on. - Hello. - Hello. This friend's officer at state-hydraulic works. It's been four years. State promised to solve the water problem. One day, engineers, politicians and all came here. They started to work. One week later, they left me here as the guard and went away. As matter of fact, there's nothing to guard. They forgot me. But he always goes to the town and gets his salary. But I really believe they will remember me one day. This friend here is his faithful friend. Hello. Doctors gave all the medicines to the man. But the stomach ache didn't stop. When the man died, they opened his stomach and found a tree taken root just like a stone. His son makes the handle of his pocket knife out of the tree as a keepsake. Years later, he wanted to cut turnip with that knife... as soon the knife touches turnip, it melts. In other words, if doctors would have given the man turnip, the man wouldn't be dead. Someone won the lottery this week as well. Wolves descended upon the villages and took a widow. It's bear, not wolf! Wolves also come here now. Let's play old maid. You also lose it but you don't care. Because there's a gold purse. If you have money, you are always self-satisfied. God damn it, butchers! He's not a stranger, he's one of us. Darling, shut your eyes. Shut them, my sorrowful and gloomy one. Nothing to see. Fuck these cards. Come on, don't talk with the cards anymore. Damn it, I talk! Since I have no proud, I talk when I lose. I am human. Human because I bare the secrets of my heart, man. Welcome. Dash it! As I see the world upside down, I understand that... all the lamps will be ashtrays. All the tables will be woods. All the mirrors will be heads. Will my young friend wait until then? He's proud. Those proud wait. Because they wait something they want. Those who want are going to wait. I will not wait. For nothing. Not for lottery. Not for night. Not for clocks. Not only on the days I was waiting... I also always think about it after my story ended. How can I be sure that she will return to... there, to the town I was waiting for? Why was I waiting? For what? During the time I was waiting... I was well aware that things surrounding me and in fact all the world changed. Nevertheless, I preserved my hope to return to my home, to my mother and brother. I waited for that woman... exactly for four months and fourteen days at that town. We were approaching the end of the long winter. I cashed out my last gold coins. - Let me take your garbage. - Leave them. Don't take any offense but... let alone fixing it, you ruined this clock. You didn't give your soul to it. I dealt with it too much. It was perfectly working once. I thought how small but sad the shop was. I assumed he'd watch the thing I've entrusted... and would fix it. - Didn't you watch the thing I entrusted? - Well. I couldn't really. You turned your back to the trust I gave. But it's not with me now. Come again? A young man watched only once and was mesmerized. He doesn't return it. He's not from here. He didn't leave me alone. He constantly watches me. Always. This could remind a lot of people their dreams. Actually I've never forgotten you. I'll bring the trust right away. It's very near. - Really? - Yes, very close. The kid watches it all day long and waits. Come to my shop, I have a new clock. Beautiful clock. - How is it? - Very beautiful. You'll see. We're leaving. Please, don't go. He's been waiting for you there for months. I beg you, don't leave. He has the thing! He's coming, wait! Where did they go? I dunno. What's this? That boorish pushing me was eating it. A candy. Journey into the land of heart, so you'll commit to the path of heart. The clock tower... Don't go there. Don't get mixed up with this. Is there any street in this town where you can't see the clock tower? The only place where you cannot see the clock is inside the clock tower. - Is there any clockmaker around here? - Ahead, on the right. Alas! You're not milkman. Who are you, my son? We are closing. Good morning. Give us two tea. If you don't fight with sorrow, it won't let you go all of your life. Like a terrible malady. If you submit to it, it will consume you. I struggled with it for years now. My soul will be redeemed today. Yes? I came to bare my soul. I have a story for clocks. From where? From a long road. From The City of Heart. The only way we can find the meaning we lost in our faces is by remembering. By finding lost beautiful times. Remembering and telling the pain. Searching for the wheels of secret clock in our spirits. Clocks remember. Here you are. Are you ready, sir? Please start. What I loved the most in this life has been my daughter. My daughter the most. My beautiful daughter. However, she, just like her mother, abandoned me and went away. One morning, I found her room empty. Quite empty. What I loved the most in this life has been my daughter. Because I can't speak my language. Because when I speak my language... they say I speak others' language. So I submitted a petition again. Because I can't forget my language. Because if I forget my language, I can't remember others' language at all. A petition again. Because I can't tell my troubles. When told my troubles, they say those are someone else's troubles. So I submitted a petition again. I go to the fountain. Between the fountain under the tree and the window of my kitchen... is a long way. If one loves like me, one accepts to be loved just like one loves and lives this as a hope. Not to be defeated by sorrow, I went to coffehouse at sunset. In mornings, before sorrow sets in, I gave myself to work. For years. I knew you'd come. Come. Sit. Where is your clock? Hold it close to your heart so your face will speak. The youngster is ready to bare his soul. Once upon a time... a beautiful woman... put a young man on the trail of a lost treasure. The beautiful woman had heard the mystery of the treasure from her dad. He said its map was on faces. Searching for what she was saying, the youngster... mingled among those whose faces are maps. He travelled city by city. Travelled to dead towns, to lost valleys. One day... when he was lost among the forgotten ones... he understood he has lost the beautiful woman as well. He then noticed his face was a map as well. The child started to search not for the treasure... but the mysterious woman. He came to a city one day. Wherever he goes, he'd see a clocktower... and feel the presence of the woman. She is watching me, he'd thought. And that's when he understood... what would would arise from his unhappy life... was the gaze of the woman. Because the youngster... was seeing her in his dreams all the time. And he'd wake up crying each time. He loved her. I loved her as if... searching for his lost soul or... as if waking from a dream. I knew I would find you. Oh my dear. You know nothing. I realized you were here for the clock was right. Why did you stop it? I wanted to forget. Did you sleep well? I did. But I couldn't forget. I saw you in my dream. A train ticket. Tariff. But no train passes here. I knew I will see you in my dream. What was I doing? I was holding your face with my two hands. You were going to tell me the end of the story. But again... I woke up before my dream was concluded. Tell me the rest of my dream. Let me wake up peacefully from my sleep. Dreams are never concluded. Only stories conclude. Recently, a man came. His face was full of sorrow. He sells lottery tickets in street. He saw a face of a woman in a lottery ticket. And he couldn't forget it. All his life went astray. They mocked him. On his face, he had such a gaze... I'd have liked to tell him to go on searching. Not the woman on the ticket. I'd have liked to tell him he'll like searching itself. Let's be like we used to be. I'd bring you photos. You'd look at faces and tell me their stories. I want everything the way it used to be. I love you. I love you. I love you. Do you think that I never thought you'd be searching for me? That I never wanted... to appear where you were searching for me one day? Sometimes, I wanted it so much that... your gaze became my gaze. I'd think he was looking for me in a city of mournful ones. I'd be in that same city. I'd say myself that now he's looking at the faces in newspaper clippings. Each and one of those faces would become my face. I'd think of you so much that... the world at which you were looking would become me. Then I'd know it. That you don't want me, but the world. What do you see? Tell it. In the mornings, I'd wait you as much as the photos you were bringing. I liked your curious and smart gaze. But I knew I'd eventually find the face I was looking from among the photos. I am not mistaken, my dear, I am not the face you're looking for. Sometimes, when I was going through the photos you brought... I'd feel your eyes on my face. I'd think to myself, would it be possible at all for me to be someone else? Then, if we look at each other, we'd see each other, not the world. Ourselves. We wouldn't needing the world. We still want to call night for day and day for night. In fact, everything is so simple. Night is dark and day is luminous. It'll illuminate more in a while. I'll spend all my life with clocks and faces. You'll return to the City of Cities. We'll never see each other. Believe me. I am not the dream you're seeking. Not at all. Dear, please don't cry. I beg you. Did it belong to your father? Don't cry my beautiful girl, hush now. Don't wear yourself out. I'll buy you a pen. I'll buy the ballpoint pens, not the clicking ones. Hush now. She has no mother, doesn't trust his father. Tell me, my dear. Can one achieve everything he desires in life? No. You see! I like you, my friend. Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, in a far distant country, lives a thief. A thief of dreams. He'd break into dreams of those who were sound asleep. He'd steal dreams he likes into his sack and flee. Those whose dreams were stolen would feel a certain uneasiness in the morning. They visited a holy person. Told their troubles. The holy person was such a wise man. He told him that... so that you lost your dreams, tell me about your hopes. But the troubled ones couldn't remember what they dream of. Since they couldn't remember, they wouldn't form what they hoped. You know why? Because I have their dreams in my sack. Voila, a mirror... an iron... and a lamp.
