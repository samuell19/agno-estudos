Tell the Rabbi what the problem is. ﻿Greetings, Rabbi. ﻿My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for five years now. ﻿She goes to the ritual bath, ﻿we keep the rules of purity, thank God, ﻿we keep kosher, go to synagogue on Shabbat, Tefillin, of course. ﻿We've tried all kinds of treatments and... ﻿it's not working. ﻿My wife thought maybe... ﻿you could give us a blessing some kind of guidance to speed up the process. ﻿Rabbi, he keeps the laws of purity, Shabbat, ﻿they've tried treatment and it isn't working. His wife can't get pregnant. ﻿What's your name, sir? -Ovadia. ﻿Ovadia? -Ovadia Rahamim, son of...? -Son of Yaffa. ﻿Son of Yaffa. -And your wife's name? -Rachel, daughter of Leah. ﻿Rachel, daughter of Leah. -Rachel, daughter of Leah. ﻿Here, Rabbi. Rachel, daughter of Leah. ﻿Ovadia Rahamim son of Yaffa and Rachel, daughter of Leah. ﻿Yes, yes... ﻿Rabbi.. ﻿The Rabbi says that it says in the Zohar: ﻿That means: Don't trust in man, don't put your faith in gods, ﻿only on God Himself because he gives you strength. ﻿Yes. -What does that mean, Rabbi? -Hold on. ﻿God willing, he'll have a son and they'll be happy and raise him ﻿and see his wedding day. ﻿The Rabbi says that if you dig deep, you'll find your soul's inner light ﻿and from there will come your salvation. ﻿God willing, right? -What does that mean? ﻿The Rabbi will bless you and you'll have to leave. Come here. ﻿The Rabbi will bless you. ﻿"He who blessed our holy forefathers Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David and Solomon ﻿"will bless Ovadia, son of..." ﻿Yaffa. -"Son of Yaffa, and will bless his wife, ﻿"Rachel, daughter of Leah, with a son this year." -Amen. ﻿"And they will see his wedding day. Soon, in our day, may it be God's will, amen." -Amen. ﻿May God bless you with great miracles. ﻿May He grant you a son, ﻿may you see salvation, blessings, success. It'll be all right. ﻿Yes, who's Uri Yishayahu? Yes? ﻿Excuse me, but I didn't understand what he said. ﻿Didn't you get it? You have a lofty soul. ﻿The Rabbi said not to force it, ﻿and you'll come back with good news, bro, it'll be all right. ﻿Bless you, bro. ﻿Well? What did he say? ﻿I told you. He mumbled a few words, threw me a blessing and that was it. ﻿That can't be. He must have said something. ﻿What did he say? Speak up, Ovadia! -Rachel, that's all he said. ﻿He told me to pray more, did you expect him to tell me to eat chutney? I've had enough of this crap ﻿You must not have understood him. Tell me what he said. He's a great rabbi. ﻿I'm telling you, that's what he said. I sit there like a sardine for two hours ﻿for him to tell me I should pray more. Wow, what a genius! ﻿I've had it with that crap, Rachel. ﻿It's all bullshit. All they want is money. -Calm down and don't talk that way. ﻿I don't want to calm down, okay? Prophet, my ass. ﻿What?! -Leave me alone. I've had it with you. ﻿Rabbis.. ﻿Did you bring a doctor's referral? ﻿I left it at home. ﻿Can I bring it later? -No. ﻿You have to leave a deposit of 6500 NIS. -What? ﻿Those are the rules. Excuse me. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Hello? ﻿Can I have a pen? -Hold a second, please. ﻿Here. ﻿Yes. ﻿Okay. ﻿Fine. ﻿9 a.m. Okay.

Right? ﻿He's a smart guy, bro. He isn't the wimp you think he is. ﻿He's okay. Right, Mickey? ﻿What's going on? -It's okay, we're talking. ﻿Hands off. -It's okay. ﻿We're just talking, buddy. -Go check some bags, Ovadia. ﻿Ovadia, Ovadia... -Hey, hey, hey! ﻿What's going on?

Wait a minute. ﻿...money laundering, extortion and black market loan-sharking. ﻿Mr. Rosenthal, what do you have to say in your defense? ﻿Fuck off, cocksucker! ﻿Get that camera off me! ﻿The police claim that Rosenthal has built a financial empire from loan-sharking. ﻿He's also built illegal casinos ﻿and taken over businesses in financial crises. ﻿Today, for the tenth time, Rosenthal escaped the long arm of the law. ﻿These charges are ridiculous. ﻿My client is a totally legitimate businessman. ﻿If you have proof to the contrary, let's see it. ﻿But if you don't, let him live with his family in peace. ﻿Thank you. ﻿All right. ﻿Looks good, Shalom. -Does it? Fantastic. ﻿Didn't it make me look fat? ﻿On the contrary.

Why? ﻿Yes or no? ﻿I do, but I haven't driven in a while... ﻿but I have one. -Nonsense. It's like riding a bicycle, ﻿it comes back to you right away. ﻿Come outside with me. -Why? -Come on. ﻿This is a working bike. A killer. ﻿Get on, feel it. Wow, it's so comfortable. -Whoa, whoa! ﻿Get off the bike, moron! -Shut up, Romano. ﻿What's going on here? ﻿Get off the bike, it's mine. -Is it his? -It isn't his. ﻿For fuck's sake, Rami. -This is the brake and this is the gas. ﻿I know. -You know. They're all the same. ﻿Well? -Nice. ﻿It's so comfortable. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Go ahead? -It's yours, Ovadia. Go ahead. ﻿Are you serious? -It's yours. ﻿You're kidding. -Take it.

Why should that cocksucker have my bike? ﻿What has he done? -What has he done? ﻿He made me 250,000 in two weeks. What have you done? ﻿What have I done? -Yeah, what have you done? ﻿I got you that spot with Reuven at the port.

Calm down. -Don't forget, two lines means yes. ﻿I know, we've been through this a million times. Don't get me going. Relax. -Well? -Relax. ﻿What does it mean if one line is lighter? ﻿What? ﻿What, Rachel? ﻿Yes! ﻿What, what, what?! ﻿We're pregnant! -You're kidding! ﻿Yes! ﻿Are you serious? Don't drive me nuts. -I'm serious. Honey, we're pregnant. ﻿We're pregnant. -My sweetheart. ﻿To the new father, may it be a son, God willing. -Amen. ﻿One more. -No way. I'm going back to work. ﻿One more. Fire! Fire! -No. At the end of the night... ﻿One little one. -Later, buddy... ﻿Sergei, let in those two girls. ﻿Good evening, enjoy. ﻿Wow. -What? -Wow. ﻿Amazing. -I'm working on myself. ﻿I'm proud of you. ﻿Nice. -What? -The swan. ﻿You can't relax, huh? -Let the poor guy in, ﻿his arm's hurting, he's gonna get gangrene. ﻿Let him in.

Come here. ﻿I have a job for you. ﻿Some asshole cab driver owes me a lot of money. ﻿He isn't on the list, it's personal. ﻿Do me this favor, you'll get a nice bonus. Rami, give him the details. ﻿His name is Haim Abramov. He works for Kastel Taxis. ﻿Give him a call. ﻿We don't want a shekel from him. Fuck him up good. ﻿What do you mean, fuck him up good? -Fuck him up good. What don't you get? ﻿Grab the bastard and rearrange his face. Got it? ﻿Not this week, Shalom. Maybe next week. ﻿Don't give me any crap. Take care of it for me. Tomorrow! ﻿Off you go. ﻿Why don't you send Gabi? -I know what I'm doing. ﻿Why, can't I do the job? -Forget about it. -Can't you? ﻿I can, but forget it. ﻿Hands off, bitch. -Stop it! -Butt out. -Can't you do the job? ﻿Chill. -Fucking asshole. ﻿Did you call a cab? ﻿Are you Abramov? -Yeah, get in. No smoking. ﻿Where to? -The, industrial zone. ﻿Where in the industrial zone? -Just drive, I'll show you. ﻿25 shekels. ﻿Pull up a little. -Where to? ﻿Just a few yards ahead. -Are you trying to drive me nuts? ﻿What is this, an amusement park?

He doesn't want your money. ﻿He wants you dead! ﻿You hear me? He wants you dead, the bastard. ﻿Tell him I need one more week. I'll get the money together. ﻿Don't you get it? Haim, don't you get it? -I'm begging you... ﻿He wants me to tear you apart. He wants me to get rid of you. ﻿Then take my taxi, take my taxi and kill me if you want. ﻿Calm down. Listen to me.. ﻿Just kill me, I'm tired of living... ﻿Abramov! ﻿Just kill me and get it over with. ﻿Haim. ﻿Haim. ﻿Calm down. Listen to me. ﻿I'll take care of you, okay? No one will hurt you. You have my word. ﻿Here. Take the keys. ﻿Listen up. It's important. ﻿Make yourself scarce. You hear me? Disappear. Vanish. ﻿Leave the country or something. ﻿Get the hell out. -Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. ﻿Are you all right? -Yes. ﻿Go on, get out of here. -Thank you. ﻿Look who's here. ﻿Ovadia, where's the motorcycle? ﻿I don't like it, Shalom. -Good, then give it back. -Shut up, Romano. ﻿If he isn't using it I want it back. ﻿Shut up or you'll get a face full of coffee. ﻿Did you deal with him? ﻿I tore him apart.
