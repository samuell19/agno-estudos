Dad, I don't have time for this. Did you think about getting a housekeeper? Don't just say no. Things are taking a toll on me, too. Dad! You're sure about a suspended sentence? Most likely. Did you buy the stock - I told you about? - No. It was a very exclusive tip. You don't trust me? Probably skyrocketing by now. I'm light on funds. I thought you made a lot working for LEE & U. That only applies to partners. I haven't been there long. Ah... So, can you tell me how long I'm supposed to get? - Pardon me? - Just curious, you know. To get an idea of what my money's worth. Are you offended? No, sir. They'd have asked for 10, - probably get 5. - Jesus! That sends chills down my spine. So, who wants to recite? Ji-woo? Want to try? Quiet. Snow", by YUN Dong-ju. "Last night snow fell abundantly" "on the rooftops, on the paths, on the farms." "Perhaps it is a blanket" "that keeps us from the cold." "That's why it falls only in the chill of the winter." You memorized it quickly. Well done. Have a seat. It's a lie to say snow is a blanket. It doesn't keep you from cold because snow is cold. Snow is... cold. Snow... is cold. Dad. Dad? Dammit! What's the matter with you? I've got to pee. I've been holding it too long. Life is pure joy for you, isn't it? Take those off. Son... I can't sleep. Want some rice wine? Okay. Kaliopenia is a condition where the level of potassium in the blood drops significantly, possibly resulting in death. The drug's manufacturer has halted production on the drug for two months. PARK Jong-sun reports. You're taking your meds? Algae is supposed to be good for Parkinson's. Worry about yourself. In 46 years, how come you've never brought a girl home? I'm not going to get married. It's too late, and I can't afford it. People ask me if you like men. You know, I don't mind if you bring a guy home. As long as he's nice. Life is... too lonely on your own. Enough talk for tonight. She has a university education and lives in this neighborhood. Her folks are good people. Name and number's on the back. Your mother was older than me too. Kinda looks like her. Right? Last week, we reported on a toxic sanitary pad case involving C&A. The FDA announced the result of their findings yesterday. (We condemn C&A for concealing the truth!) I'm at C&A, the center of the controversies regarding toxic sanitary pads. 'Lawyers for a Democratic Society' held a press conference this morning. We believe that a toxic substance found in C&A's sanitary pads... She looks familiar. She came to your 70th birthday party. Oh, your university friend? Did you say she was divorced? You remember everything. Divorced is okay. As long as there's no kid. She has a daughter in middle school. We should just get a dog. Yo, Chipmunk! How can you let someone like that bully you? I'm embarrassed for you myself! But you're like that. Stop it. Both of you! Oh... Oh, no... Don't stop. Don't do that... Please! Stop! What's the matter? - Ji-woo? - What's wrong, sweetie? It's okay, it's okay. No. No, sweetheart. It's okay. Just calm down. Calm down, baby. There, there. Calm down. It's okay. Don't do that... Ahh! Mr. KIM! (INNOCENT WITNESS) Morning, Mr. YANG. Morning. I'll do that. It's my desk. I like tidying up. And I'm not really busy. You deserve to work with a good lawyer. All lawyers in this firm are good. I heard you were a fierce fighter at the NGO. Really? The mock trial for the C&A pad case was moved forward an hour. Per client request. Client request... I don't understand why they want me there. It's not even my case. Mr. LEE speaks highly of you to everyone. We'll begin the mock trial for the C&A sanitary pad case. It's a rehearsal, but I want you to think of it as the real thing. So... you're not new to trial situations? Is this really necessary? Can't you handle it by yourselves? Sit up, please. Straighten your back. All eyes will be on you. It's best to lower your gaze slightly. I'm not a school kid. No sarcasm and no talking back, please. Judges are human, too. Negative attitudes will impact their decision. You have a long list of charges against you. Judges are humans, too. What about lawyers? Everyone! This firm will be in the news a lot because of this case. So be aware. The prosecution will try to prove the sodium polyacrylate used in your product may have a direct connection to cervical cancer. Did you receive that report? I have never seen that report. Conviction. Good. - You've been searched, right? - Yes. Then they have documents with your signature on them. - Yes. - You just committed perjury. That's why this prep is necessary. Then I don't remember. Why did you laugh, Mr. YANG? I didn't. Something in my throat. Mr. YANG is not involved in this case, but I called him in anyway. The victims are represented by Lawyers for a Democratic Society. You worked there for a long time, right? Yes, sir. Tell me, what's the best defense strategy for us? 128 cervical cancer victims filed the suit, including 17 who've already passed away. C&A must make an official public apology. We've been trying to keep things under wraps. Wouldn't that attract undesirable media? We should adopt a strategy that the CEO lacks medical knowledge and the study was only conducted on a small study group. That's the answer we want. While they pull at the heart, we pull facts out of the air. Shall we continue? How long have you been here now? Just over a year. How has it been? The cases you deal with are different. I'm adjusting. I know you've been assigned only small cases, despite your ability. We won the MJ inheritance tax case thanks to you. You just need to make a little effort. I continually hear that clients aren't comfortable around you. Why do you think that is? It's because you're not tainted. If you want to succeed in society, you have to be willing to get a little grime on yourself. Let's talk about why I called you in. I want to make you one of our representative lawyers. The firm's public image isn't very good. People think of us as pawns of the establishment. We need to change that image, and you're perfect for that. Skilled, with an NGO background. Which is why I want your help on a pro bono case I've taken. I'd be honored. I need to focus on the C&A case, so take the lead in preparing this - and I'll have your back. - Yes, sir. Death by asphyxiation? The prosecution is arguing the housekeeper committed the murder and staged a suicide. The defendant maintains she was trying to save the victim. She admits being at the scene? Well, there's... a witness. The way I see it, the prosecution built the case solely on the witness' account. The witness is... 15? - She's young. - And autistic. Autistic? There's a lot of media interest in this case. Death, housekeeper, autistic witness – everyone's eating it up. Bring it in. Just to help you out. Because you'll get busy. Ms. OH Mi-ran? - I'm your attorney, YANG Soon-ho. - Hello. I've heard you'll represent me for free. Thank you so much. Please, sit. I'm sorry... Being here is... difficult for me. Before we start, can you promise me something? Of course. I mean, I'll promise you anything. You're here to help me. Right? That's right. All I ask is you don't lie to me. I can't help you unless you're completely honest. Don't worry. You're the only person I can trust right now. Alright, then. Shall we start with the day the victim died? I'd just gone to bed when I heard a strange noise. I thought it might be a cat, so I went to check. The noise was coming from Mr. KIM's bedroom. Mr. KIM, are you alright? Mr. KIM? My God! What are you doing? Oh, my God! Please, stop! Mr. KIM! Mr. KIM, please! Oh, God! My God! Mr. KIM! Mr. KIM! Please don't! Mr. KIM! What's going on? Mr. KIM? No! No! It was like his determination gave him beast-like power. I couldn't restrain him. So I thought I'd get something... to tear the bag. I rushed out and saw a pair of scissors. Mr. KIM! I guess I was petrified by the sight. My feet turned to stones. I couldn't move. It's all my fault. If only I hadn't panicked so much. Did Mr. KIM ever talk about suicide? His wife passed away 2 years ago. He always said he'd follow her soon. All the neighbors know that. Mr. KIM even had to get treatment. I'm alone in this world so I don't need money. Mr. KIM could be difficult at times, but he put a roof over my head. We've been like family for 10 years. Why would I do such a horrible thing to him? Sir, do you like spiced pork? I'm sorry? I consider that my specialty. I don't marinate the meat beforehand. I heat the oil until just smoking, add garlic and sugar to caramelize, then leave the pork shoulder and sauce to sizzle... - Sounds delicious. - It's really not bad. I have no money to give, but I'll cook for you if you help me. I'm begging you. Please. - How was the meeting? - Good. I contacted the victim's son. - He agreed to meet you. - Great. What about the video interview of the witness? I saved it on your computer. Ji-woo, can you introduce yourself? Here... into the camera, please. Can you introduce yourself? Into the camera, please. Ji-woo... I'm YIM Ji-woo, a freshman... That's the witness? Are you kidding me? If you can get her on the stand, it'll be game over. Who would believe her? Cuckoo, cuckoo. I'm sorry. Sweetie, please. Cuckoo, cuckoo. - Excuse me. - Yes? - I'm looking for this house. - What? See that pine tree? Yeah. It's the two-story house behind it. I see. Thank you. - Why are you going there? - Sorry? Someone died in that house. Do you know who used to live there? Of course. This is a small town. I'm the defense lawyer for Ms. OH. Ah, you came here to help her. Yes. She'd never do something like that. She cared for the old man like he was her father. Not even a wife does that. It's absurd, locking her up based on the words of some mentally... unsound kid. Can I get your card? Sure. I'll vouch for her if you want. I'm not a stranger to court. I know a thing or two. - Thank you. - Sure. Thank you for meeting with me. I wanted to get a picture of father. I don't have a good one of him at home. Ah... He used to bug me about getting a family portrait done. I gave excuses to avoid it, but now I regret... I was wondering if you'd be willing to help Ms. OH. Absolutely not. I believe her testimony is credible, and with your father's medical history... You seem to trust people. From my long experience as an accountant, I tend to rely on numbers more than people, but I'll tell you all you need to know about my father. - Who is it? - Who is it? Hello, I'm Ms. OH Mi-ran's attorney. "I'm Ms. OH Mi-ran's attorney." Are you Ji-woo's mother? - Yes. - Hello. I believe you know Ms. OH. As her attorney, I was wondering... I'm sorry, but we have nothing more to say about that. If you'll give me a moment to ask some – Sorry. I understand this is bothersome, but it's very important for my client. It's not because it's bothersome. My daughter has had trouble sleeping since that night, but it's starting to get better. I'm not going to make it worse again. Besides, she already told the prosecutor everything she saw. I'm sorry we can't help. Ma'am! This is where she saw it happen. Hey, you must be Ji-woo. Hi! Sit up, sweetie. What's interesting here is this girl's condition is atypical for what we commonly see in the autistic. How so? First off, she has high intelligence. She sounds like a five-year-old to me. From her lack of focus, it's easy to assume that. Let me sing along cuckoo But if you listen carefully to the way she talks, the song I just sang is called "Cuckoo Waltz". It's dance music in three-four. Strong-weak-weak, strong-weak-weak. She's very logical, You sing well, Ji-woo, almost like a little professor. That prosecutor... seems to have knowledge of autism. - Really? - It is like a textbook scenario. The session is well controlled and in the presence of a guardian. He's not leading her either. Do you feel her testimony is admissible? If you show it to another doctor, I'm sure they'll say the same. What if I put her on the stand? Communication will be tricky. She lives in her own world. It'll be tough for you, and for her, too. Some people might wonder if she even understands the question. You must be thirsty. Have some water. (Cancer-causing sanitary pads! Prosecute the responsible!) Hang on. You still haven't fixed that light? You could trip. Careful. Open the door, sweetie. Good to see you, Mr. YANG! Long time, no see! I brought ice cream. Need help? Don't touch it. It's like a chimney in here. Just leave it alone. Mom told me what you like. Looks like you got all my favorites. Mom! Let him taste it first. Let's see. Ah, this egg smells... smoky. It's good. Really good. When did you first meet Mom? After I started university, so... Over 20 years ago. Whoa. What was she like back then? Actually, I see a bit of her face in yours. You don't have her personality though. Yeah, she can be... - Can be what? - Too by the book. Exactly. But, Mr. YANG, that means she's correct all the time, so how about we just say she's strict? You take after your mom after all. Oh! Let's take a picture with my new phone. - Sounds good. - Okay. Smile. How's your dad? He's okay. He's gotten slower but talks far more. About getting married? He just won't give up. How come you're not dating? My dad's condition... plus I'm still paying off debt. There's someone out there who understands that. What about you? Happy doing what you love? Happy being frustrated, you mean? How rotten the system and how mighty and rigid its walls. Su-in... the C&A suit is going to be a long battle. Eventually, people will lose interest, and you'll end up defeated. Why don't you focus on settling compensation for the victims? You sound like a peddler. I sound realistic. There are things you have to accept. Autism and Asperger's Syndrome... Damage... Autism... The Mysteries of Autism... The World through Autistic Eyes... Geez... Makes me queasy. (LEE & U! Lapdogs of the Bourgeoisie!) (YANG Soon-ho Attorney-at-Law) (I'll remember that face!) Watching porn? Dad... come on. If you watch that stuff, you'll never find a real woman. I wasn't. Ta-da. What have you got? Pick one. What are they? Wow! It's meant to be. She must be the one for you. Give her a call. I knew it. - Just one date. - Give it up! I can't afford to think about marriage! Do you know how much I still have left to pay back? Because you provided security for your friend's loans? How can you be like that? What choice did I have? Watch my friend's life end? The witness' testimony is... likely to be admitted as evidence. What does that mean? It doesn't mean it'll affect the trial, but we need stronger evidence to support suicide. God... Can I ask you a favor? Of course. Attorneys have a duty of confidentiality. We're penalized if we breach it, which means, even if you're guilty of the crime, I cannot reveal it to anyone. Are you willing to take a polygraph test? Do you...? You think... If the test is fair, then I'll do it. If it'll get rid of your doubt, I'll do it. Should we now? No. I believe you. Even if the prosecution requests it, refuse. It could affect the trial, and it's by no means 100% reliable. Yes, sir. Let's talk about the trace of butane found in the bag. I don't understand it. We have a gas line, so there's no need for any gas. Shit! Aw! Sorry. What's this? (Pre-trial arrangement) Both of you approach the bench. It's down to YIM Ji-woo's testimony. Yes, Your Honor. Considering the witness has autism, the prosecution suggests using the affidavit and filmed interview. She's the sole witness to the incident, and her testimony was the basis for my client's arrest. As defense counsel, I cannot represent my client if I don't get a chance to ask the witness a single question. Prosecutor, if the defense doesn't concur, the witness has to take the stand, correct? No, Your Honor. There are exceptional cases whereby supplemental materials replace witnesses who can't take the stand. Please consider the girl's special circumstances. She may not be able to answer the defense's questions, especially in an unfamiliar environment. According to your reasoning, she can only provide her testimony in certain circumstances when asked by certain people. Can such testimony be considered valid at all? My client requested a jury trial, and juries have a right to hear the testimony. If necessary, I will conduct another video interview with questions provided by the defense. From my experience of examining her during investigation, I fear this courtroom will be harmful for her. Give me a moment. I'll order the witness' attendance in court. That seems only fair. Okay? Good work, gentlemen. Excuse me. Mr. LEE... Let's do this right. I'm sorry, but I don't shake hands with opposing counsel during trial. I heard your brother's autistic. Yeah, what about it? That's why you were assigned the case, I presume. Possibly. Let's be fair and square. Teach me how I can communicate with her. That's only fair. If you're thirsty, dig your own well. How can you ask a prosecutor to help a defense counsel? You want to see my case files too? Well? Bye. How do you keep up with someone in a wheelchair? What? You walk at their pace. Autistic people live in their own worlds. It's hard for them to break away from that because they're born that way. No fluffy words, okay? Be straight with me. If you want to talk to someone who has difficulty getting out to you, then you have to go in to them. Stop it! Hey, Sin-hye! Are you Ji-woo's babysitter? Let her be. She gets paid for it. Really? It's not a bad idea, idiots looking after each other. Hope you get rich. You must be Ji-woo. Who are you? I'm a lawyer. Here's my card. Business card. Are you her friend? - What's your name? - Sin-hye. Sin-hye... A lawyer is one of 702 professions that will disappear in the coming era! Is that so? It's rude to say that to a lawyer's face. I'm sorry if I was rude! Not at all. - 267... - Hmm? 267 dots on your tie. Seriously? Remember the incident you saw? When an old man died? You mean the house across from Ji-woo's? You know about it, too? The lady who used to live there. I'm her attorney. I'm so thankful that at least one of you is responding to me. Yes, thank you. Don't worry. She hears everything. I see. Anyway, Ji-woo, I'd like to chat with you about what you saw that night. He asked you a question. No, he didn't. When you ask a question, you must raise the end. It's the same thing, dummy. Is it okay for me to ask you questions about that night? I refuse. Do you always hang out together? Only between home and school. Otherwise, she wanders off. Can't you stay still for just a second? You're a good kid. No, I'm not a good kid. "No, I'm not a good kid." - What's the matter? - Because of that. One, two... Go! Ji-woo, the lady wasn't trying to hurt the old man. She was trying to help him. Do you think you can help her? When a stranger follows you, report it to the police. - No, Ji-woo! - What? Oh... okay, okay. I get it. - Mister? - Yeah? Start with things she likes. She'll talk after a while. What does she like? What all autistics like. Puzzles and quizzes. That kind of stuff. Puzzles and quizzes... (First Day of Trial) Nervous? Just don't let people see it. Aren't you nervous? Not really. I envy you. I have confidence in my client and my reasoning. Shall we proceed? The defense wishes to admit new evidence. - Damn... - What have you got? The deceased's medical records, including his mental health. Your Honor, I see no relevance in such records. The deceased showed signs of anxiety and insomnia. Traces of prescribed sleeping pills were found in the autopsy. Medical records are not irrelevant. I will allow them, not as direct evidence, but as valid material in determining whether this was suicide or homicide. Thank you. The prosecution may sit. Mr. LEE, back to your seat. Sir? Would you rather go home? Oh... Members of the jury, please remain quiet in the courtroom. The prosecution may begin. State your name and where you work, please. My name is YOO Jae-hong. I'm with the National Forensic Service. I analyzed the corpse and evidence gathered. What was the cause of death, according to your analysis? Death by asphyxiation via plastic bag placed over the victim's face, blocking the passage of air. What kind of plastic bag was it? Just a regular, small, trash bag. This is the same type of bag. Correct? That's right. So... if someone put this over a person's head, wrapped tape around their neck, then restrained them by force, without tearing the bag, the victim would surely die from asphyxiation, right? Objection, Your Honor. The prosecutor is basing his question on the assumption of murder. Let's hear the witness. We all know it's hypothetical. Answer the question, please. If force was used, then yes, the person would die. From when the bag was placed over the head to time of death, what's the estimated time lapse in your opinion? Considering the deceased was in his 80s and was agitated from the struggle with the defendant, I would say about 4 minutes. Did you find anything that suggests the defendant tried to save the deceased in that 4 minutes? The bag had multiple fingerprints on it, all belonging to the defendant, but no signs suggested the defendant tried to tear the bag open. Are you saying you could find no physical evidence of the defendant trying to save the deceased? No. Ms. OH is... a healthy, robust woman in her early 40s. The deceased was in his 80s and weighed less than 50 kilograms. A 43-year-old woman of solid build failing to rip open a plastic bag because a frail old man resisted her? That possibility is close to zero. No further questions. Am I guilty of being healthy? Defense, you may cross-examine. That's right. Anyone can easily rip open a plastic bag, but as the oxygen level dropped inside the bag, the deceased must have struggled more, correct? Sir? Am I right? Yes, I would think so. So, if the deceased had willingly put on the bag and was struggling fiercely, could he have been restrained easily? Considering the difference in strength between the deceased and the defendant, I think he could have been restrained. Let's look at the screen. What you see is an extract from a paper published in 2011 entitled, Forensic Characteristics of a Drowning Person". According to the paper, a drowning man can exert Hercules-like strength under respiratory distress, a result of the human survival instinct. Victims are even often found with broken or missing fingernails. Sir, have you seen this paper? Yes. I wrote it. It's in direct contradiction to your testimony. So is what you wrote in the paper false? - No. - Your Honor, the defense is badgering the witness with irrelevant questions. Counsel, please choose your questions carefully. Yes, Your Honor. Based on your paper, could the deceased have exerted superhuman power? Please answer the question. - Yes. - When I came across this case, the first thing that struck me as curious was whether it's possible to commit suicide using a plastic bag. So I looked up 'plastic bag suicide' on the internet, and what I found was surprising. In the States, a suicide kit furnished with a plastic bag is being sold on the Internet. Also, suicide using a plastic bag has become a growing social concern. Recently, four people in Korea committed suicide using a plastic bag. Your Honor, relevance? Sustained. The jury will disregard that last comment. Your Honor, allow me to speak a little more. Go on. There's something interesting about this method. Butane gas is put into the bag in order to induce hallucinations, thereby reducing suffering. Traces of butane gas were found inside the bag used by the victim. If you'll look at the screen again. This is the butane can found at the scene. If we can prove that Mr. KIM bought this himself, it could be key evidence for getting closer to the truth. Mr. Prosecutor? Yes. Would you accept it as evidence if I could prove the purchase? Don't try to lead. This is a clip of Mr. KIM two days before his death. Your Honor, I'd like to admit this as evidence. His purchase of butane gas is not proof of suicide! I'll allow it to be admitted. Court is adjourned. We'll convene again in two weeks to examine Ms. YIM Ji-woo, who is the eyewitness in the case. - Thank you. - Thank you. Ji-woo! Sin-hye! - Hello. - Hi, Sin-hye. I'm not a stranger anymore, am I? Look, I got something for you. Do you not like it? Aren't those for little kids? That's biased. I still like puzzles. There are different kinds. For instance, this is a math riddle. How do you make 7 with three 6s? I don't know. "I don't know." Think about it. The hint is a fraction. What's the answer? If you add 6 over 6 to 6, then you get 7. Is that lame? It's about changing the way you think. What about logic puzzles? That's my favorite. Logic puzzle? "Logic puzzle?" How do you build a house with the windows on all four walls facing south? That's too hard. "Ottogi Jin Ramen" "Ottogi Jin Ramen" Stop! You're embarrassing me. Shall we get ramen? - Um... okay. - Okay! Okay! Don't do that. She only eats blue ones. You can trust blue jelly. She's almost back to normal, thanks to you. Thank you, Sin-hye. - Cross! - Bye. Mrs. YIM, do you remember me? I ran into Ji-woo and said hello. We have a prosecutor and a defense attorney. Now we can do the trial at home. I came to ask you one more time. You can refuse the subpoena. Yes, I refuse. "Yes, I refuse." Bye. Ma'am? Well, hello, Mr. Prosecutor. It's a matter of life and death for someone. I want to hear your examination, but I'm doing this for Ji-woo's sake. For no reason, can you let an innocent person get punished? All evidence points to suicide. What's the matter with you? - You know what? - What? Autistic people can't lie, so I believe Ji-woo. I believe Ms. OH. And even if she isn't lying, Ji-woo could've misunderstood the situation. People call prosecution and defense the spear and shield, but let's forget about that and be balanced armor instead. Okay. Show me what you did with her. I want to get close to her too. I refuse. You refuse... (Toxic Pad Case Dismissed) Why didn't you answer your phone? I want to be alone. I came to drink alone, too. It's only the first trial. How can you be so naïve? You're up against a team of 15 lawyers, all former judges and prosecutors who specialize in this sort of thing. So what? Are you telling me to give up? I'm telling you to pursue practical interest. Looks like I'm up against 16. - What? - 15 plus you. Are you here at your firm's request? Come on! I'm worried about you. I won't... turn out like you. Can you please go? This is about to get ugly. (Release prisoners of conscience!) Definitely want to visit Mongolia. Switching to offense now. - Play ball! - Play ball! Hey, YANG! Come join us. Is your family from Mongolia? You two have met, right? This is Mr. LEE Yun-jae. Hello, I'm YANG Soon-ho. Nice to meet you. I'm LEE. There! It's a hit! That pitcher has no control. I remembered you're a baseball fan, but I also have something to discuss with you. - Come have a drink. - Thank you. Since YANG has joined us, let's all drink together. Cheers! - Good to see you. - Good to see you, man. - Alright! That's more like it. - Bravo! Come on, baby. Scumbag... Why don't you girls give us the room? So... I heard you like soju. Yes, sir. I don't take to the taste of whisky. Whisky has different levels, but the shitty thing is, if you drink good, top-level whisky, you can't go back down a level. Sometimes, I wonder if I work just so I can drink. - YANG. - Yes, sir? You met KIM Man-ho, the CEO for the accounting firm, Taewha? Isn't he the son of the deceased in my case? We're fellow alumni. He's looking for a legal advisor. I was thinking about recommending you. That's huge. I know you and he are connected by weird coincidence, but I expect the pro bono case to be over soon. It's a really good opportunity for you and for this firm. Is it something you're interested in? A recommendation is by no means a guarantee, but just so you know, you have to get a little dirty. Just tell me what I need to do. Drink up and enjoy. Be a man who fits this kind of scene. I can do that. Bring the girls back in. Come on, ladies. Let's get some dirt on you, huh? Dirt? Dirt... You're home. You're still up? This is a good book. I might get promoted to partner. Aren't you happy? What's that? What's partner? Well, that's... It's a good thing. They make tons of money. So making tons of money is good? Of course. We can pay off your debt. If you're happy, then I'm happy for you. Goodnight. (Su-in) The North Pole? "If you build a house at the North Pole..." The puzzle! - Hello? - Is this... Ji-woo? Yes. This is YIM Ji-woo. Is that the correct answer? Yes, it is. Okay. Hello? Ding ding ding! Correct! Next puzzle. Five numbers that add up to 15 and multiply to 120. Please give the correct answer! Okay. Ji-woo? Hello! - Hello? - The answer is 1-2-3-4-5. Is that the correct answer? That's correct! Well done! Ji-woo? Did you... hang up again? No. Okay. So you like puzzles like me. Why don't we decide on a time every day? I'll give you a problem, you think about the answer, and tell me the next day. - Okay. - How about five? 5:00 PM. Okay. YIM... Ji...woo Save. - Related case files. - Thanks. YIM Ji-woo Hi, Ji-woo. The answer is 3/4. Is that the correct answer? That's correct! Well done. Congratulations. Hey! Pass the ball. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come here, you! How dare you, you...! Come here! Little shit... Pick on someone your own size! Ji-woo. So good. Slushies are the best! Can you trust slushies? That's correct. Congratulations! Okay. Hello. You should check if the other person has finished talking before hanging up. Have you finished talking? Yes. One, two... Go! Ji-woo! Ji-woo. Did you see how the dog was wagging its tail? He was saying hello. He was happy to see you. It's like when I wave at you because I'm happy to see you. The barking is too loud, like my ear drums might burst. Sorry for keeping you waiting. No problem. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. Funny how we're meeting again. Yes. Did you sign the contract? - Yes, sir. - Let's see. Now, we're family. That's right. I look forward to working with you. Take a drink. It's good. It's good. Drink already! Ugh! I drank it, too. I drank it because of you. We're friends. You should drink, too. Swallow it, you autistic idiot! It's weird if just one side is red. I've got to make the other match. What are you doing? I thought you were a good kid. I told you I wasn't! You... No, don't go with her! Did she do this to you before? Hit you and make you eat things? Mom told me to go with Sin-hye. Mom told me. That's when she was your friend! Sin-hye is my friend. Ji-woo, people who bully you are not your friends. She's just using you. She pretends to help you, but then bullies you. No, no... Hey! Hey! What's the matter? Ji-woo! Don't do that! Ji-woo! It's okay! Ji-woo? Ji-woo! Hold on a second. When is her guardian coming? She'll be here soon. Don't tell my mom. Why not? Her heart will break, and Sin-hye will get punished. Sin-hye will hurt, too. Ji-woo... if you don't tell someone, it'll only get worse. I think you should tell your mom and the school. Ji-woo! Sin-hye is her only friend. To think even she... I don't know much about these things... but have you considered a specialized school? Change my diapers. Excuse me? Those were her first words. She'd just turned one. While other babies could barely mumble 'mama' and 'dada', my Ji-woo spoke a full sentence. She could read freely by the age of two. Not children's books, but newspapers. I thought she was a genius. Wow! What's she going to be when she grows up? She's really smart. She talks logically, and she's amazing at solving riddles. If only she weren't autistic... Then she wouldn't be my Ji-woo. If only she weren't autistic... I never once thought that. About today... I don't know how to thank you. Don't mention it. Have a good night. - You, too. - Ji-woo, cross! We'll see you around. Have a safe journey home. - Thank you. - Thank you. Mr. YANG? Would you like to talk with her before you go? May I? Go on to your room. Can you wait here a moment? Of course. It'll be better in her room, right? That's what the prosecutor did. Shall I? Can I come in? Yes, you can. Just hit me! How can you let him do that to you? Makes me embarrassed to watch. He is like that. Don't do that. Please stop. Can I sit here? You'll regret it. (My Dream: Lawyer) Did you want to become a lawyer? - Yes. - Why? They're good people. They help others. Are you a good person? What? Well.. Wow, that's the first question you've ever asked me. - Here you go. - Thank you. Turn it off, Ji-woo. You're going to talk to him, right? What if I do this? Yes, set it to mute. Ji-woo, do you remember that night? The night when Mr. KIM died. Go on. Answer him. Yes. You told the prosecutor... He means Mr. Hee-jung. Yes, you were telling Mr. Hee-jung that the lady grabbed the old man's face, and the old man fell over. Yikes, that's just pathetic. Sweetie, can you focus on the questions? Sorry about that. She likes to mimic what she hears people say on TV. I see. Where did the lady grab the old man's face? Here. Like this. And that looked like an attack? Yikes, that's just pathetic. You going to keep doing that? Let me have it. Just a sec. I know you've had a tough day. You probably want to rest, and I'm bothering you. People's minds are difficult. Sin-hye is always smiling, but she uses me. Mom always looks upset, but she loves me. You smile a lot. Are you using me, too? (Second Day of Trial) You'll do well. Don't worry. 53... 52... 51... You okay, sweetie? This way. Ji-woo... This way. Come on, baby. It's okay. The damn legal fee will set me back 5 grand! Ji-woo... Darling, come on. Mom's here. Look. Look at Mommy, baby. It's okay. The witness may take the stand. You don't have to do this if you don't want. Okay? It's okay. Mommy's here. It's okay, baby. Witness? Are you not feeling well? Your Honor, may I check the witness' state? Go ahead. Ji-woo, are you okay? The ticking sound is too sharp. What ticking sound? That ticking sound. Your Honor, for the witness, who has acute hearing, can we stop the clock for now? She can hear that? Alright, then. Can you take down the clock? Whew... that's better. You okay? We can start now, sir. Okay. I will not reveal the witness' personal information since she is under 16... Witness, why are you giggling? The sound of your voice is funny. Well, thank you. The witness will not take the oath because she is under the age of 16. It doesn't mean her testimony has no effect, however. Members of the jury, please take this into account. The prosecution may examine the witness. Ji-woo... cross. On June 16, 2016, around 5:00AM, you heard a window being smashed, correct? Yes. Did you look outside upon hearing the sound? Yes. Then you saw Mr. KIM's house? Yes. Please tell us what you saw after that. I could see the old man with a plastic bag over his head. What was he doing? He was doing this... and was trying to escape. Then, Ms. OH, the defendant, approached the old man? Yes. What did she do? She grabbed the old man's head. How did she grab it? Like this. What did she do next? She attacked him. How did she attack him? She grabbed him, then made him fall over. Did she look like she was trying to help him? No. She was attacking him. Objection! The prosecution is asking the witness' opinion, not what she saw. The witness voluntarily chose the word 'attack'. Allow me to ask her why she felt that way. The prosecution may continue. Why did you think the lady was attacking him? When she made him fall over, the lady was... smiling. That's all, Your Honor. The defense may cross-examine. Witness, you have autism spectrum disorder. Correct? Yes. What's the title of this book? "Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder." That's right. Can you read out loud this underlined part? "Autism spectrum disorder" "is a chronic mental disability." I see. Can you read this part, too? "While an average person" "can easily identify facial expressions" "and interpret the meaning of actions," "a person with autism spectrum disorder" "experiences great difficulty" "in understanding the emotions of others." Right. Another problem is that autistic persons cannot discern someone's intentional action from their coincidental action. This is due to their lack of ability to understand the intention of action. We'll carry out a simple test to see if this is true. Go ahead. Witness? Can you tell me what expression the woman in the picture is displaying? She's smiling. Why do you think that? The outer corners of her eyes are drooping, and her mouth is curling up. What expression is this, then? It's a sad expression. Why do you think that? Her eyes are narrowed, and the corner of her mouth is drooping. I see. Then what expression is this? Her eyes are narrowed, but her lips are curled up. - Prosecutor... - Objection, Your Honor! It's a smile. Your Honor, please! The defense is insulting the witness with a meaningless test! She witnessed the incident as it happened! Not some cunningly constructed image like that! Your Honor! It was an urgent situation even a normal person could have misjudged. For someone with a mental disability... What? Having special circumstances like this witness... Your Honor, she lacks the ability to discern whether my client's intention was to harm or to help. Please consider the case based only on what she saw, not her interpretation of it. If you feel the witness is incapable of identifying expressions, then an expert should judge her cognitive ability. I believe the test made a point, and the defense's line of questioning was relevant. I also believe we must rely on what the witness saw with her eyes, not her interpretation of the situation. The prosecution's objection is overruled. Defense counsel, do you have any more questions? No, Your Honor. Prosecutor, do you have further questions for the witness? No, Your Honor. Then this court is adjourned. I'll pass the verdict in two weeks. Good work, everyone. Thank you, Mr. YANG. Two, three, four, five, six, seven... 267 exactly. Ji-woo. Dividing 12 into 2 to make 7 is 7 and 7. You can cut the Roman numeral 7 in half. Is that a correct answer? Ji-woo, at the trial today... Is that a correct answer? That's correct. Well done. Am I... a mentally disabled person? That wasn't what I meant. Hello? (Grief) (Happiness) Hello, Mrs. YIM. Is Ji-woo home? Maybe you can't read my facial expression. Sorry? Did it feel good to humiliate my daughter in front of everyone? I apologize if you felt that way. I was doing my job as a law– Labeling someone crazy in front of their face? That's doing your job? That... It was a mistake. She's been asking me all day if she's mentally disabled? And you pretended to care for her! I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm here to apologize to Ji-woo. Get out of my face before I call the police. (Sentencing Hearing) All rise. Case No. 2016 - First Trial - 12985 Defendant OH Mi-ran, please rise. After examining the arguments and evidence provided by both sides, Ms. YIM Ji-woo's testimony, which served as the sole basis for the charges cannot be deemed sufficient grounds to support the prosecution's claim due to her mental state and inability to communicate. In consideration of the jury's opinion, I have reached the following verdict. This court finds the defendant not guilty of her charges. Ms. OH will be released immediately. - Congratulations, ma'am. - Thank you so much. You saved my life. Thank you so much. - Come on, let's go. - Yes. The prosecution launched an appeal. Yikes, that's just pathetic. Yikes, that's just pathetic. I'm not scared one bit because you have my back. What will you do now? I'm going to see my son. I thought you didn't have any family. Oh, there's this... kid I care for like he's my own. I'm going to go see him. She once got drunk and told me she had a baby without a father and was forced to give him up. He's very sick, and she needs money to treat him. The late Mr. KIM donated generously every year. He expressed his wish to donate all his fortune after he passed away. We were in the process of completing the paperwork when all this happened. My firm's been in great difficulty. Now, we're family. Attorneys have a duty of confidentiality. We get penalized if we breach it. I... I'm sorry. The lady attacked the old man. The lady was smiling. Hey, kid... tell me what my expression is now. I did not kill him! If you ever mess around in grown-up business again, I'll rip out that pretty mouth of yours. Want to get a drink? We could go to your place. Soon-ho, I think it's best we don't see each other anymore. We're walking different paths now. Things will continue to get uncomfortable. (Ji-woo) The number you have dialed is switched off... Ji-woo's mom I can't believe you people! That woman came looking for my daughter. Hello. How's Ji-woo doing? She had a serious episode and had to be sedated. Um... and her mother? She went down to admin. - How much is it? - 30 dollars. Why do you want to be a lawyer? They're good people. They help others. Are you a good person? Prosecutor LEE Hee-jung. It's me, YANG Soon-ho. I want to talk to you. I beg you to consider letting Ji-woo take the stand one last time. I can't believe you have the audacity. Of all people, I thought you'd understand. I do. I know so well how hard this is for Ji-woo, and I'm still asking you. Don't you think we've done enough already? I'll just pay the fine. I'm not putting her through this again. I understand. I'll find another way. Mom, I want to be the witness. You can't. It's too tough on you. Mom, I want to be the witness. Honey... you've already done it. You remember how terrible it was. Yes, but I still want to be the witness. You've done more than enough. Let's forget this and move on. Mom, I speak well, and I read well too, right? Of course. But I won't ever be able to be a lawyer because I have autism. But... I could be the witness, couldn't I? Ji-woo... Mom, I want to be the witness. I'll be the witness, and I want to let people know the truth. - Long time no see. - You bastard! - What's the matter with you? - What did you do? I got pulled off the case. They assigned another prosecutor! What are you talking about? I know your firm is behind it, you bastard! I swear I know nothing! Calm down and let's talk. Can we do that? You just won't give up, will you? "I almost forgot your birthday." "Thank you for being born." Dear son, I almost forgot your birthday. Thank you for being born. You've been the true joy of my life. When you turned 16, you told me you wanted to be a lawyer. With your energetic face, you said, "I want to do good things". I was so thrilled, I farted. Not thrilled because you wanted to be a lawyer but because I knew I'd raised you well. Having lived this life, I learned it's not always rosy and sweet. The world is heartless and full of hypocrisy. We make mistakes, and we suffer dearly. Still, my dear son, forget all that has gone past you. There is no one who never makes mistakes. I just want you to love yourself. Dad. Huh? Because only then can you love others. Dad. (First Day of Appeal) Long time, Mr. YANG. How have you been? Good morning. - And yourself? - Good. Thank you. Witness, come to the stand. Is the witness not here? She's here, Your Honor. Good. Are you YIM Ji-woo, the witness? Yes. Take the witness stand. We'll examine the witness now. Who wants to start? I will, Your Honor. The witness is autistic. "Autistic people" "lack the ability to share their feelings" "or convey memories correctly," "much like a child." That's what is written here, so regardless of what the truth is, she is unfit as a witness in the first place. Witness, are you aware you're different from other normal people? "Seemingly abnormal and aberrant" "doesn't suggest inferiority." What? That's also written in the book. Here's another quote – "Every man" "is different." What are you doing? It's the predisposition needed for questioning. It is? I bought this handkerchief on the way to court. How many dots are there on this handkerchief? 196. Could you count how many drops of water are there are? How is this relevant to the case? I'm trying to determine whether she perceives things correctly. Your Honor, please consider that she has a special way of communicating. I'll move onto the case now. Judge KIM, would you count the dots? Yes. Your Honor, to help her feel at ease, do you mind waiting until 5 o'clock? It's 4:57, so that's only 3 minutes. Go ahead. There are 196 dots. Ji-woo, it's 5PM. Can I pose a quiz? Yes. Court Martial, standing by the door, can you help me with something? Of course. Witness, will you tell me what he says? Yes. Sir, can you state your name and rank in a quiet whisper? Seoul High Court, Court Martial KIM Young-hoon with the Security Management Squad. Is that a correct answer? Um, yeah! She's right. This is a paper on autistic people's hearing. "Some autistic people have very acute hearing." "It is one of the special abilities" "often found in people with autism." "One child told me that a butterfly's flapping" "sounded like thunder in her ears." Mr. YANG? YANG. Can I have a word? One moment. I have more questions. Witness, you could tell the exact number of dots on the handkerchief. On the day of the incident, do you recall what the defendant said? Yes. How many words did she utter during the incident you saw? 52 words. Let's see if your answer is correct. Witness, can you recite exactly what the lady said? We have a shorthand typist. We can count the words later. YANG! Yikes! That's just pathetic. Yikes! That's just pathetic. Why are you putting up a fight? If only you die, both your child and my child can live. Just go quietly, will you? If you had the money to give away, you should've given it to me. You just won't die. Tenacious old fool! Tenacious old fool! Finally... Dead for good... Yikes, - that's just pathetic... - that's just pathetic... Tough as a boot... My, oh my... My, oh my... Not counting punctuation marks, exactly 52 words. YANG, we need to talk now. The witness stores the sounds she hears like a photograph. That's why she can give such a precise account. The reason for confusion so far was because we didn't understand her or... weren't willing to. YANG Soon-ho! You're the defense counsel. - Snap out of it! - Lawyers are humans, too. We should be. Your Honor, tell him to stop speaking. This man is breaching his duty as a defense attorney! Mr. YANG, are you sure about this? Yes. We'll discuss Mr. YANG's breach of duty later. For now, I wish to hear more. This is absurd! This has to stop! I have unique and sole authority over this court room. I could hold you in contempt! - Shut your mouth, you fool! - What? Stop this trial immediately! - You bastard! - Remove him from the court! Stop this trial right now! This is a mistrial! This is a mistrial! Do you hear me, you retard? Mr. YANG, you may continue. Prejudice. Unfortunately, I was prejudiced against Ji-woo. I thought she and I were different people. I didn't trust her, and I only saw what I wanted to see because I thought only of myself. But the witness was different. Despite the harsh prejudice she was subjected to, she chose to take the stand again in order to tell the truth. In my career as a lawyer, I've never seen a witness who gave a more precise testimony than her. She has told only the truth from the beginning. It was us... who didn't know how to communicate with her. Ms. OH, will you tell us the truth now? Only then can I help you. If you confess, your sentence can be reduced. I will help you. Your son... you have to see him again. Ms. OH, who told you to murder Mr. KIM? It was... his son, KIM Man-ho. I place you under arrest for instigating the murder of your father. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you... Ji-woo, you did everything you had to do. You became the best witness in the court. Thank you, Ji-woo. Thank you for taking the time. No problem. Ji-woo really wanted to invite you. If I knew it were such a big party, I would've worn a tie. Ji-woo! Come on, you invited Mr. YANG! Mrs. YIM, that's okay. That's just Ji-woo. I'll go to her. I heard you started at a special school. What are your friends like there? They're... weird. Weird? You don't like them? They're very weird. - It's good. - It's good? Yes. Why? I don't have to pretend to be normal. You've been trying to be normal all this time? Yes. I practiced. Happy birthday, Ji-woo. I might be busy from now on. I might not be able to talk as much, so I got you this. - Thank you. - Sure. And you can open this one later. I should go now. Bye. Have a great birthday. I'll see you around. Yes, what is it? I called because it's 5PM. Mr. YANG Soon-ho... is a good person. I'm trying, Ji-woo. I'm really going now. Bye. How have you been? Good. I think I might have to quit practicing. I heard. I don't know what I'll do from now on, but one thing's clear: I don't think I can do it without you. Have you had dinner? Not yet. Want to get a drink, too? I'd like that. (Happy Birthday. Ji-woo!) (Directed by LEE Han) (JUNG Woo-sung) (KIM Hyang-gi)
