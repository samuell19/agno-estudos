[laughter] ♪ Our tale today concerns the first-born son of Charlemagne, and is entitled: ♪ But, before we begin, let me assure you what you are about to see is the true life story of Pippin. You see there have been many misconceptions about Pippin -One that he was: -A hunchback. -That he was: -Enormously tall. -That he was: -A midget. -That he was: -Completely bald at the age of 14. [Leading Player laughs] But I beg you, please cast all previous misconceptions aside, and accept what we enact for you today. The life of Pippin begins: [baby crying] Pippin, as a child, showed a tremendous thirst for knowledge: Immersed in these pursuits, the years went by quickly. Charlemagne sent Pippin to the University of Padua. And the faculty of that university granted him the special title of scholar of the house. Pippin replied to this offer in his own deeply moving words. [rhythmic clapping] Um, he may be a little nervous. This is his first time playing this role. Could I have a little more light, please? [Leading Player laughs] Well, he's not that nervous. [claps] Gentle tutors, respected members of the faculty, I'm very grateful for the knowledge that you have given me. But I'm afraid what I'm looking for can't be found in books. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do, where I want to go. ♪ Everything has its season ♪ Everything has its time ♪ Show me a reason and I'll soon show you a rhyme ♪ ♪ Cats sit on the window sill ♪ Children fit in the snow ♪ Why do I feel I don't fit in anywhere I go ♪ ♪ Rivers belong where they can ramble ♪ ♪ Eagles belong where they can fly ♪ ♪ I've got to be where my spirit can run free ♪ ♪ Gotta find my corner of the sky ♪ ♪ Every man his daydreams ♪ Every man has his goal ♪ People like the way dreams have of sticking to the soul ♪ ♪ Thunderclouds have their lightning ♪ ♪ Nightingales have their song ♪ ♪ Don't you see I want my life to be something more than long ♪ ♪ Rivers belong where they can ramble ♪ ♪ Eagles belong where they can fly ♪ ♪ I've got to be where my spirit can run free ♪ ♪ Gotta find my corner of the sky ♪ ♪ So many men seem destined to settle for something small ♪ ♪ But I won't rest until I know I'll have it all ♪ ♪ So don't ask where I'm going, listen when I'm gone ♪ ♪ Far away you'll hear me singing softly to the dawn ♪ ♪ Rivers belong where they can ramble ♪ ♪ Eagles belong where they can fly ♪ ♪ I've got to be where my spirit can run free ♪ ♪ Gotta find my corner ♪ ♪ Of the sky [vocalizing] ♪ [applause] And Pippin made a promise: I promise not to waste my life on commonplace, ordinary pursuits. Terrific. You see, I know that there is something, um... Fulfilling? Something completely fulfilling? Yes. That's it, that's it. Something completely fulfilling. Oh, fantastic. And I'm going to find it. [chatter] ♪ Journey, journey to a spot ♪ Exciting, mystic, and exotic ♪ ♪ Journey through our anecdotic revue ♪ [laughs] ♪ [laughs] ♪ The royal court of Charles the Great. The first day I was home from Padua, I tried to get an audience with my father, but they told me he was too busy. The second day I tried to speak with him at dinner, but he was too drunk. The third day, today, he came to visit me. Enter: Charlemagne. This part is to be portrayed by an actor of enormous power. A giant on the battlefield and in the bedroom. [laughter] Oh, thank you so much. [laughter] Good morning. Good morning, sir. Well, welcome home, son. Oh, Father, I wanted to talk with you so badly. Uh, talk, talk. Yes, talking is good. Hello, son. ♪ Hello. You look thinner. Oh, yes, I know. So, son... So? ♪ Last night didn't you miss dinner ♪ No, Father, I was right there, but you were drinking. Ah, yes, so you were, I remember. I always remember. Now, tell me how things have been going with you in Padua. Not very well, sir, some of my tutors-- Good, good. I'm a firm believer in education. And yet you've become the most powerful man in the world without it. The most powerful man in the world? Pippin, don't exaggerate. What about the Pope? Oh, I rank you ahead of the Pope, sir. Well, I happen to agree with you. Enter Lewis! ♪ Pippin's half-brother, offspring of Charles and Fastrada, and, after Pippin, heir to the throne. Addicted to the physical, Lewis loves weight lifting. Lewis loves wrestling. But most of all, Lewis loves Lewis. [laughter] ♪ Yah, yah, yah, yah! Ah, well done, brother. Well done? Ha! That was magnificent! Did you know this arm slew 20 Frisians last year? And it's going to slay even more Visigoths. Enter Fastrada. Pippin's step-mother. Devious, crafty, cunning, untrustworthy, but a warm and wonderful mother. [laughter] Dedicated to gaining the throne for her darling son, Lewis. Yoo-hoo, Lewis! [laughs] Guess what Mommy has for you. No, no, no. Surprise! Oh! Oh, thank you, Mother. Oh, look at this! Isn't it a beauty? Oh, that's really beautiful. Look how I shine. Ha, Visigoths! Oh, my babe. ♪ [applause] ♪ Oh, we're so proud of Lewis, aren't we, dear? Oh, my darling, before I forget, the royal treasurer informs me I'm overdrawn in my allowance account. You're overdrawn again? Now, now, my lord, don't be angry with me. You know how confused I get about money. After all, I am just an ordinary housewife and mother, just like all you housewives and mothers out there. [laughter] [applause] [laughter] Well, son, now we can have our little chat. ♪ How've things been going with you? Well, sir, not very well. ♪ Welcome home, son, welcome home ♪ ♪ I'm so glad to hear there's nothing wrong ♪ ♪ Welcome home, son, glad you're home ♪ ♪ Will you be staying long Well, sir, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. -I wanted to ask you-- -♪ Welcome home, son, welcome home ♪ ♪ Well, I've got to go, it's almost noon ♪ But, Father, I wanted to ask you something. ♪ Welcome home, son, glad you're home ♪ ♪ We'll talk again soon ♪ ♪ The preparations for the Visigoth campaign were reaching a peak. Marksmen tested their bows and arrows. ♪ Swordsmen tested themselves against one another. ♪ The panoply of war was being assembled. The sights, the sounds of glory were in the air. ♪ The royal court of Charles the Great, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. And a giant in the bedroom. [laughter] And a giant in the bedroom... [laughter] ...is prepared to hear petitions. I beseech you to reduce my levy of foot soldiers, cattle, and wheat. -Due to a famine-- -Denied. Next. But, sire, that is unjust and tyrannical. Oops. Take that man away and hang him! Charlemagne, you are a tyrant! Next! Oh, great leader, blessed by God-- Oh, no. Out! Everybody out! Council is dismissed. -Wait! Father! -Yes? I know what I want to do now. Good, good. -I want to be a soldier. -What? I want to join you in your campaign against the Visigoths. -Denied. -But that's not fair. To an emperor, fairness is irrelevant. But you're taking Lewis. Yes, your brother Lewis is an ideal soldier. He is strong and stupid. [laughter] You, on the other hand, are educated. Father, I have to talk to you. I am busy. You're always either busy or drunk. You're suffering me the insults of ungrateful offspring? I'm sorry, Father. Well, very well, go ahead. I'm listening. Well, sir, I'm your eldest son, I'm your heir. That means I'm going to be king one day, and fighting wars is an important part of being king, isn't it? Fighting wars is the most important part of being king. I mean, the Pope and I have dedicated ourselves to bringing Christianity to the entire world, even if we have to kill every non-believer to do it. [laughter] Well, that's what I'm talking about, sir. You're dedicated to something, and I just want to be dedicated to something, too, with all my heart and all my soul, and whatever it is, I want to do it as well as I possibly can. That's a nice thought. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Otherwise, my life won't have any meaning at all. So you want your life to have meaning, do you? Yes, I do. That's very ambitious of you, Pippin. Father, stop all this bullshit and take me with you. Well, that's more like it. Get yourself a decent helmet and come along. ♪ -I'm a soldier. -Right. [laughter] Me, a warrior. Finally, a chance to be a part of something important. A chance to use my sword, and my arm, and maybe even my blood. ♪ Blood! Ha! Glory! Ha! Hah! ♪ Gentlemen, be seated. ♪ Map! ♪ Well, gentlemen, it's been a long, hard march. This is where we are, here. Tomorrow morning at sunrise we go against the Visigoths. Hah, Visigoths! Sit down, Pippin. Now the main factor in tomorrow's battle is the terrain. So look at the map. Study it. Remember it. Father, why don't we just go out there and slaughter them? Nyuk-nyuk. -You spoke, Pippin? -Well, sir, I just feel since we're stronger than they are and we're braver, we might as well just go out there and kill. Doo-dah, doo-dah. War is a science, Pippin. Well, that takes half the fun out of it right there.

Give us the strength to butcher the infidel that the righteous may flourish upon the face of the Earth. ♪ Lewis, Pippin, it's time. You're going to be very proud of me, Father.

[horrified gasps] I await your orders. ♪ I hereby order you to seek out the enemy and negotiate a settlement. Very well, sire. King Pippin the Peaceful!

[she chuckles] Isn't that a crock? King Pippin the Humble! Sire! I have met with the Hun, he will withdraw on one condition. There, you see? Now, I told you. There isn't one problem that can't be solved by just sitting down and talking it over. Now, what's the one condition? He demands your reproductive organs separated from the rest of your anatomy.

But, sire, I have no more men to wage a campaign. I have no money to buy supplies. I have no army. Excuse me a minute. Nobles? Uh, you remember that decree I made a little while ago about land and taxes? Yes, sire, what about it? Well, it's off. Off? You mean you want me to pay taxes again and raise an army? Yeah, that's right. But, sire, without land, I have neither money nor power over the peasants. Oh. Yes. That's a very good point. That's a very good point! [sarcastic laughter] Then I hereby suspend land reform. Suspend land reform? Why the hell should I work when the poor get handouts from the royal treasury? Uh-huh!
