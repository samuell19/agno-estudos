You are listening to Radio City, 91.1! I'm your Radio City RJ Sunitha. How are Valentine’s Day special songs? It feels so just by sitting here and listening to the songs. And what would the situation in Valentines street be then? Every Valentines’ Day, that Premadesam cafe witnesses many love stories. And what sort of love story is it going to see this Valentines’ Day? Hi! Thank you! Hi! Hi! You asked me to come for saying something? I mean, that is... That is… That is... Damn! Come on, Arjun! Why do you hesitate? Is there really nothing to say? FOUR MONTHS EARLIER -Hey guys! -Yay! The stage is all set for your fresher's party. Today is your day. Are you ready? Yes! Now, let’s welcome Arjun and his gang. YO! “Freedom, freedom! It is there for us” "Freedom, freedom! It said what you think" "Freedom, freedom! It is there for us" "Freedom, freedom! It said what you think" "In the college campus" "Who is a champ than us?" "Share a smile, what's blocking?" "Freedom, freedom! It is there for us" "Freedom, freedom! It said what you think" "So many limits and so many troubles" "Cross over all those rights and wrongs" "Become a lover, who will stop you?" "Give a pose and prove to be super" “After so long this life got one chance” “Whistle and do a dance on mass beat” "Freedom, freedom! It is there for us" "Freedom, freedom! It said what you think" "Freedom, freedom! It is there for us" "Freedom, freedom! It said what you think" "If you try, beautiful babe will be lover wherever she is" "Get on the bike and roam as a couple" "No stopping, whatever the world says" "People around should see in a shock" "Voices supressing you should go shut now" "Freedom, freedom! It is there for us" "Freedom, freedom! It said what you think" "In the college campus" "Who is a champ than us?" "Share a smile, what's blocking?" Hey Principle! He'd bash us up if caught now. They are nabbed. Good! Keep it up! Didn't our Principal say anything? Hey! Who is she? Never seen before. May be she is a junior! Hello, aunty, he’s right here. I’m giving it to him. He is right here. I’m giving, aunty. -Hey! -Yeah! Your mummy is on the phone. -She called you, it seems. -Yes mom! -Yeah, coming. -Hey, shirt… -Give that t-shirt. -I’m coming, mom! Hey, my phone. Madam, it is ready. Madam, why are you hitting? Madam, say why are you hitting? Oh no! Madam, say why and hit. We are doing all waste deeds and are polluting the environment. These plants bring down that pollution at least a bit. You are polluting even those plants. Hmm? Sorry madam. Clean that and bring all the plants down. Ok madam. -Sir, please! -She looks to murder for plants. Sir, please! Sir, sir! Take this 100 and leave for this time, sir. -Please, sir! -Huh! Hey, when we do our duty perfectly you encourage us like this. When we ignore and take, you again shout aloud saying we took bribes. All these fines are for your safety. You get helmet by spending 500 once. Then you don’t need to pay 100 every time, right? Yes sir! You are right. So, you are not a police taking bribe. I have a small doubt. What happens to the fine you collect? It adds up into Government treasury. Where does that go? It is used on development. Do you believe that? I dont trust that. Forget that, I have an idea. These vehicles are the reason for pollution. Instead of fining 200 to those not following rules, make them buy two plants. Our people bargain even for the coriander. They'd water and grow plants bought for 200. At least so, pollution will go down a bit. Pollution free environment is also a development. Heard it, right? Hey Satti, take 200 and give two plants here. Ok, mam! Wow! You got a master mind mom, -you gave it off. -Here, take it. -Thank you sir. -Ok Sir. -Pay money. -Oh no! -Sir, look at this guy here. -Oh no, mom! -He too has no helmet. -Mom! -Make him also buy a plant. -Please! Namaste, sir! It is sin to give pocket money and again snatch it back so, mom. Rules are same for all, son. You and your pose like Vijayashanti! Mom! I saw a girl today in College. She is cute. She is very cute, mom. Cute, she is so very cute mom. What son, are you in love? No way, I’ll first say you if love, right? Somehow, I have a doubt. You are saying cute so many times, I'm getting some doubts. A doubt, it can be! No girl ever was remembered like this. Why is she so now? Is this love? Mom! Oh no! Huh? Mom! Mom! -Mom! -Yes! Why are you shouting? Is the coffee ready? -Mom! -What? -I said about a girl yesterday, right? Look… -Yes, cute girl! She is in our opposite house, mom. Wow! Your lover is so cute. She is my daughter in law. -Ah? I’m fixed. I’ll call that girl. You propose to her. Come on mom, I don’t even know her name. I’m just seeing as she’s cute. -I liked her crazily. -Same here! Added, she is even watering the plants. I’ll call her. You propose to her. She's so great. Why do you say no, son? Crazy fellow. -Hey girl! -Mom! -Hello! Hey girl! -Mom, stop it. Hi! -Mom… -Wait! Ah! Who are you? I never saw you in uncle’s house. This is my grandpa’s house. Oh, are you Anand’s daughter? -Yes! How long are you here? I’ll be here now, aunty. I got a seat here in MLR IT College. Oh nice, nice! -So, you are here for four years now. -Yeah! You have lot of time to trap her. You are very cute, you know? Thanks aunty! If I had a son, I'd have got him married to you. Mom called, she wants to talk with you. -Ok, bye aunty. -Bye! Good morning, father in law. Father in law? Good morning. She calls me uncle daily and why father in law today? -Arjun! -Hmm! If I call the old man as uncle, she’ll be sister to you. She’d set for you if I call father in law. What shall I call? Father in law! Father in law! Yes, that’s my boy! She’s so cute. She’s also watering the plants. -Arjun! -Hmm! -You impress her, propose her… -Ok! and make her my daughter in law fast. Orelse… Whoever marries her, I’ll adopt him and make her my daughter in law. -Just joking! -It’s gone a bit far. She’s super, right? Huh, not many colours in this class. Who is this fellow looking like a bear? Hey! Not like this to him. -Who comes next? -Let’s see. Show some bloody respect to your seniors. Stand up, idiots. I’m surprised. -Don’t go down, maintain it. -Ok! -You attack now. -Ok! -Sit! -What are you studying so much? -Are you still in school? Why are boys and girls sitting either sides? -Shuffle! -Change! Come on! We studied in boys school, right? Ask all boys to come this side. -What, dude? -Boys school! Boys school! Yes! Have you come to study or romance? Shuffle back! Yes, maintain like that. Never change again if someone says. Enough, I understood. Come on, I’ll set up. Bhadram sir, we are coming. -Sir, good morning. -Good morning, sir! Shirt is superb, sir. Must be madam’s gift, dude. -We didn’t come for attendance, sir. -Oh no way! -You’re mistaken there. -Oh, not for attendance? -No internals took place recently. -Yes! I’ll give plus, go. Not even for that, sir. By mistake, any doubts? No, why will I get doubts, sir? Still, there’s no link with doubts for your faces. It is nothing, sir. Our guy is liking a girl in your CSE department. Feel my love, sir? So, If you cooperate, we’ll come early tomorrow and plan build-up shots. Hey, you are using me bad for having drinks for once with you. Friends should do all that for each other, sir. We are all friends. Damn! -Sir, please! Please, sir! Sir, it is our guy’s love. If you accept, his love gets settled. Even life gets settled if his love gets settled. Sir, sir! Please, sir! Wow, what a life. -Don’t you need your love? -I want, dude! Ask then! -Sir, sir! Please sir! -Please sir! Do something and accept for once, sir. Do we reveal your affairs and threaten if you don’t accept? Ok, stop it! Ok! I said he’ll accept, right dude? I told you, it's worth a bottle. We’ll enter in 10 minutes after you start your class we'll come do our work, impress the girl and leave. Don't you think this is a little too much? Build-up shots would be at least of that level, sir. Ofcourse! Your look is great sir. Let’s go, dude! We’ll again… our next sitting, your old love and ok… You, idiots! (Humming) Excuse me sir! Oh, sorry sir! I need to complete this session somehow. Can you give me 10 more minutes of time? 10 Minutes, ok! Ok, thank you sir! -Hey! -Hey, why did you come again? Hey, don’t put hands as I gave lenience. Stand aside. Oh no, fat idiot is dead. Come on, let’s go. You think why did we come again? I just forgot to introduce my bro. He is Arjun. Topper of the college, topper of the batch with an impeccable track record, Captain of the basketball team, Pirates of the Caribbean Sea and End game Avengers also. She’s watching me! So, what I’d say is if you have any doubts in tough subjects like M1, -ask bro and ask me if he is not available. -Oh, I see! -What, dude? -Good job! Why is he here? I put side stand for bike. It might’ve bent the other side. I’ll shift the side and come back. -I will also join! -Hey, stop man. -Is even your bike there? -Are you topper of the college? -Sir, that is… How many trials did you make for M1? Why will you ask us ladyfinger rate, sir? Who knows? -Come on, let’s leave dude. -Ghajini is better if compared. -Hey Kungfu Panda, stop! -Leave, dude. Oh no! Fat rascal, did I ask you for idea? I lost my prestige now in front of her. Dirty logics, huh! None would give you better ideas than these. Hey, Goddess is here. -Hi! -Hi! Um… Your performance was really great yesterday. You are really talented. And I love music. -Umm… -Thanks! Friends! Ok, bye! What man, you are dancing? What happened? Say now. Girl’s name is Adya. She came herself and introduced to me. -Hi! -Hi! -Going to the class? -Yeah! I should study, I’m not college topper like you. She gave it. I said that day for a build-up in front of juniors. I just wrote only for two to three times, you know? I know, why so much of explanation for me? We studied in the same school. I too am weak in studies. Is it? Then you are of my type. Hey Arjun, good morning! -What man, no call or no message? -Me? If you avoid me, I’ll kill you. -See you! -Hey! You are… Crazy! Hey Arjun! What is this, baby? Long time no see! Ok, call me. -Bye, bye! -Hi… -Arjun! Why did you hangup the call last night! -Night? -How can you avoid me, when i was after you? -You? Me? -I even spoke to my father about you. -Your father? Will talk later, bye! -That is… -No, no! It’s ok Arjun. -Why me in between you and your fans? -Fans? -Let’s meet again. Bye! -Hey Adya, that is… Hmm. Who could have sent, Jaya? Where is Bunty? Increase the dose a bit more. Following for my guy should be on high now. Plan should be successful. You can do it! Go! -Oh no! Idiot! Is it you? -You have to… Once he’s here, it should be… Oh no! -I think not done again. -Wait, I’m coming. -Hey, stop! Hey, stop! -Oh no! I’m setting for you, right? Why do you hit me again? -Not at all good. -So, you’re fooled again in front of her? Yes! Mom, I’ll drive. Give it here. Mom, please! -Ok promise, I won’t cross 100. -Hmm! We don’t know this vehicle can cross 100 unless you drive. Children of the appartment will be spoiled if we continue like this. These Boomer uncles are always into the same nonsense. That’s why I said not to rent out to these youngsters. That’s why we say not to rent out to bachelors in flats where families reside. 20 Guys will stay in the double bedroom flat. Added are the girls. When questioned, they say bachelors and all this is common. Girls, pubs and beers at this age. Should they do it in your age? They are in twenties, let them enjoy. They’d anyways advise others when they are in sixties right? Didn’t you do anything when you were in twenties? Flirting with neighbour girl without parent's knowledge and all... Leave them free, let them enjoy. Why are you too talking in their support? Rathalu working in your house is working here in many houses. These maids don’t hide anything, they reveal everything. If these kids know about that, they’d go on YouTube and Facebook? Why all these for you at this age? That is.. What Madhumati madam said is correct. Kids right, let them enjoy. -Yes, thank you aunty! -Ok! -Go, enjoy! -Bye, aunty! Uncle got a great blow. Where is he? Where did he go? Hey, daughter in law! Said it great aunty, you’re still youth! -Adya, where are you going? -To the market! Is it? Come with me, I’m also going there. Come! Hey, me! Bye! Hey…Mom, me! Be right here, I’ll get the bike. -Adya, did you love anybody? -No aunty! -Why did you ask so? -Just like that. Adya, guys going around saying friends and music right for you? Which guys wouldn’t go around like that, aunty? Adya, is a guy who failed in exams ok for you? Not just the marks are life, right aunty? Oh my daughter in law, you are so sweet. If I had a son, I’d have got him married to you. -Hey ball! -Come on, pass it. -Ball, ball! -Come on, ball! -Jai! -Huh? Hey! Come here. Hey, they seem to have planned some revenge. Let’s see what they’d do. -What’s your name? -Rupa! Throw it into the basket. What dude, a revenge? Yes man, you did day before right? Her dress isn’t supporting. Poor girl is feeling uncomfortable. Leave her. You go to class. What will you do? What? Hey, hey! Hit that idiot. Yes, that idiot! Bash him, bash him! It’s him, who bashed me. Bash him. Hit on his face. Hey, this guy hit my back. Hey fatty rascal, what are you doing there? Hey, Adya is there. -Hey, time please for me. -No, no! Hey, not me, It is him. Hey Adya! You? You… I took you for someone else and came let going a big fight. Go idiot! Ok, bye! -They beat up badly. -You beat when I said, time please? I said time please, right idiots? I went thinking my girl came. -Hey, Principal guys. -Principal, ok jump! Adya! I think she saw it all. Ok, come on maintain some decency. -Hi! -Hi! Are you here? I just thought you were there. -Class? -Yes! Ok, no time for me. -Just a small fight! -I know. -Ok, bye! -Bye! Hey Arjun, where are you idiot? I’m right here, see properly. Come! Oh no, I got late. -Hi, mom! -Let’s go! -You said to be late, mom! -One minute! Brother, I’m hungry. Please give me ten rupees, brother. What is your name, dude? Why will I beg if there was someone to give me a name, brother? All call me as Chotu. You too call me the same. Will your hunger be done with 10 rupees? Enough for today, brother. -Next day? -I’ll beg. -The day after? -I’ll beg again. The day after that? If you beg every day, when will you fulfil hunger of people like you? I’m not giving you this as it would fulfil your hunger for ten days. I’m giving as you can think if your stomach is full for ten days. Think what you got to do, ok? All the best! Brother, this Chotu will not beg from now. Come mom, let’s go. -Two hundred rupees! -What? This is two hundred rupees. Oh! -Umm…hundred rupees. -No way! -Hey, daughter in law! -Hi aunty! -Why are you here? -Bus stop for College is here. -Hi Arjun! -Hi! -Oh, you know him already? -Yes! This is free for you if my daughter in law knows you. I don’t need, you keep it to yourself. I too am going to the College. Bye Aunty! -Adya! -Yeah! You don’t have a boyfriend? No! Why? Why because I didn’t like anyone. Oh! What do you need to like? -He should pass M1. -Huh? -What, should pass M1? -Yes! Why? Good job comes only then, right? I don’t need to do a job if he does, right? -Yes! -Hmm. -Hey, stop idiot. -Hey, stop! -Hey, catch. -Hey! Hey, stop idiot. Hey! -Hey, stop idiot. -Hey, catch him. Hey, stop. Hey! -Hey, stop idiot. -Hey, catch him! -Hey, catch him. -Catch him guys. Run guys! -A friend? -Not him, friend for you, bro. You didn’t understand? He’s from our enemy gang. I think even your enemy by seeing your mess. Yes! You should minimum bash him up. Give him two from my side. I’ll sit right here. I’ll leave only after seeing the entire show. Go on! I already said so many times. How many times do I tell, she is my girlfriend, rascal? She’s my girl, idiot. Oh no, it’s wrong. You bloody! Why to talk with this idiot? Give me that bottle. This is called as beating. Not this, understood? Hey! I’ve a rod in my hands. I don’t know to fight. I’ll break the head. Is it ok? Head will break next. Oh no! What brother, he’s bleeding. His mom will feel bad seeing this. Why do you bother, rascal? Hey! Blood should come out of the body to save someone and not for you to die. Hey, Adya! Catch him! “I’ve no words baby, shall I get some” “Shall I arrange them with love and call your name with my lips?” “I’ve no words baby, shall I get some” “Shall I arrange them with love and call your name with my lips?” “Winter touched you like a campfire, why is that?” “What’s this wonder, your smile is drenching like shower of snowy flowers?” “My tiny heart jumped over the pit wall and bit me like the honey bee” “Do you know who that is?” “Who made me fly in the sky with cute little thoughts?” “Who will clear this doubt?” “I’ve no words baby, shall I get some” “Shall I arrange them with love and call your name with my lips?” “I can’t stop or say the word from my heart” “I can’t hide or open up because of hesitation” “A word on my lips turned into a silence” “Great wars took place now with my silence” “There is some great disturbance now within me” ‘Still, it feels great” “You too feel strange like me?” “Do I feel this as a pleasure killing me?” “Who else is it than me in your heart hidden as a secret?” “You wouldn’t reveal that” “Who is that girl coming onto your eyes from the dreams?” “That’s me and you will not reveal” “I’ve no words baby, shall I get some” “Shall I arrange them with love and call your name with my lips?” “I don’t know what happened to my heart, always beating high to the sky” “Because of you I guess, I feel it every day” “I don’t know why I become crazy every time I think of you” “Because you've done to me all of it always” “I’ve no words baby, shall I get some” “Shall I arrange them with love and call your name with my lips?” Hey, Arjun, Arjun! Hmm. Look daughter in law! Hi, aunty! Switch off those lights, dear. You’re making people go sleepless here. Sorry! Good night! What? Don’t cry! I’ll ask to switch on the light if needed. No need, I can see. Oh no, you and your tricks! What do you know about difficulties of us, the lovers? Hmm. Oh, me? You are a kiddo. Yours is a love marriage, right? -Mom, tell your love story. -Hmm. -My love story? -Yes! Listen! When I was in degree, I used to go in train to college. -Guava! -Paper! He used to daily follow me. What, should you tell anything? That is… -You like me? -Hmm! No, no! No problem, tell me. If bored with your surname, why not use my surname? Excuse me! Hello! Hello, Miss! Did you get bored? Did you get bored? Madhu, did you get bored? Oh no! Very hard! What is your name? Aravind! Aravind swamy! What is your surname? What happened next? We got married. Oh my darling, yours was a great love story. You were so advanced right in those days. Our story was advanced, but your story is in seventies. Those shadow kisses, moon comparisons are cheap. Very cheap! Son, propose to her fast. Mom! when I propose to Adya it should be remembered for lifelong. Hey, who said India has just one Tajmahal? One more Tajmahal is getting ready here. Every idiot is a Shah Jahan! Excuse me! -How much is this guitar? -Ten thousands, madam. Five thousand, why don’t you give for five thousand? Madam, it costs five thousands to set for just setting a string cut. It is a very good guitar, madam. This is ten thousand in offer, coming for cheap. Don’t think! No, ten thousand may be cheap for your owner and not for me. That is the cost of a hundred plants dear. Hi Aunty! -Hey daughter in law! -Why are you here? Forget that and look at this. How is it? -It is very good. -Yes! -Please pack this. -Sure, madam. For whom is this, aunty? I’d have gifted if I had a son. I want to gift someone like him. Aunty, you are crazy. That, I am! -Wow, thank you so much. -You are welcome, madam. Aunty, I’ll carry that. What dear, why are you calculating in vacuum? That is to save how much pocket money to buy this guitar. For whom? I’d have gifted if I had a boyfriend. Hey! Idiot, have you gone blind? It is a new guitar, rascal. It costs five thousand even for a string cut. To hell with the life, it got cut once I spoke about the string. -Come on, give five thousand. -Give it. Five thousand is enough forthe string. Another five thousand is for this string. Ten thousands, account is clear now. Hey boy, come here. -Bring another guitar. -Ok madam. You said it is the best guitar. It got cut when touched and broke when hit. Why did you hit like that, aunty? Then, how will I be quiet when someone touches my daughter in law? Instead if my son was here, he’d have been out. -Ma’am, guitar! -Yeah! Aunty, you should’ve had a son. I’d have definitely married him at least for you. Really? I’ll definitely marry at lease for you. I hid a truth from you. I have a son. Aunty… That is…I’m in love with a boy. Oh! Who is he? Did you tell him? No aunty, I still didn’t tell. He too loves me, but will not say. He is from my college. I just said gift, for him. Forget about my son. Propose to him fast. He too will have a mom. That crazy woman would jump in joy if you go as her daughter in law. Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day and he will propose me for sure. If he doesn’t tell, I’ll propose to him myself. Yes, go on and tell. Don’t delay. Huh! Hi! Aunty, one second! Tell me, mom! Fool, time to push you out from home has come. Why? -Hi! -Hi! Hello, mom! There’s a guy here and I wish to adopt him. What? He’s flirting great with daughter in law. What happened? You keep planning Tajmahal there, son. Are you done? -Hello! -Hi Adya! -I need to talk to you! -Hmm. Not now! Tomorrow at 11 am. Valentines street. -Ok! -See you! -Who was that? -Arjun! Damn! Go on and tell, man! Isn’t anything really there to tell? Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! Adya! I love you. I love you. Why did you come out? Sit inside. My wife! My wife! Hey, baby! -Hi! -Hey, careful! Get lost! Oh no! Hi! Need coconut? Are you married? No? Number! Oh no, she’s giving her number. Why am I not fitting? Damn, this phone in between! Hello! You know there’s a party. You know drinks will be there, right? You know babes are great and why didn’t you still come? Hey! Oh no, cool! I came for selection in Saibaba temple, dear. Say like I understand, idiot. I came to temple with Siva, idiot. No, swallow that. He can never get married in this lifetime with his requirements. Who’d search in the temple in this generation? You should search in pubs or parties. I wished enough to pass in tenth and you made me get distinction. I wished enough to get a job with ten thousand salary and you made me get a job worth even to spend 25K per month. I asked for an useless friend for parties and you gave a most useless one. You gave so many without asking and why are you not showing mercy when I came into an age to get married and asked for a traditional girl, God? Every guy I know is going around with his wife, except me. -Hey dude! -There, I’m roaming with him. If you help me in this one matter, not just one or two but will break as many coconuts that you’d get bored. Hey dude, enough now. Let’s go. Please, dude! You shouldn’t trouble God so much. Look, babes are waiting there at the party. Come on! God, don’t forget coconuts. Just this one matter! He won’t forget. Move now. Babes! Oh no, babes are superb. Wow! Dude, you shouldn’t search for girls in temples. But in places like this! Look there, each babe is a wow. What do you say? I don’t need a girl using clothes scarcely. I need a girl using them traditionally. Ok, you keep drinking man. I’ll burn my calories and come back. -Hey my love! -“Ask the night sleeping” “I asked the birds getting back into the nest” “I asked maid in the next house and Vantalakka from MAA TV” Ok, don’t ask. No problem! -Who is this idiot? -Didn’t you inform at home, idiot? I don’t have a wife at home to inform and come. You bloody drunkard fellows! -You… -No dude, no! -Please baby! -Ok baby! Ok! -Wife? -Yes, she is my wife. -You’re saved, idiots. -Get lost, rascal! You drink, dude. Hey, he too has a wife and what’s wrong with me? Dude, you say yes and I’ll arrange great babes talking to our Srinu. Yes or no? Ok, no! Dude, no! No dude! -You rascal! -Oh no! -Mahalaxmi, please say. -Are you drunk again, son? Do I have a wife not to allow me home, if I get drunk Mahalaxmi? Huh, did you start again? You keep saying marriage and ruin with some cause when girls are shown. Everyone likes you, but you don’t like anybody. Where do I get an eternal beauty for you? Mahalaxmi, how should a girl be? She should pierce at heart once seen. When I said none is piercing at my heart, you keep showing all nobody’s photos. How should a girl be, Mahalaxmi? -Like Bapu’s drawing, Sita in Asokavanam. -I thus said can’t drive. See now, what happened? Sorry dear! Did you get hurt bad? See, he is bleeding so much. Is it paining? I’m really sorry. Come on sister, cool down. I’m crying as ice cream fell down. Mahalaxmi, you got your daughter in law. What are you saying? Say again. Your daughter in law is found, Mahalaxmi. -Really! Did you say that really? -She pierced at heart, Mahalaxmi. -She pierced at heart once I saw. -Oh God, did my son like a girl? Good if this is not a dream! Oh no, I’m going breathless. God, did you bless after so many years? -Hey! -Sorry boss! -See and drive, dude. There was none for so long at home to wait. There will be one person from now onwards. Sorry boss! Who is she, son? -No idea, Mahalaxmi. -Where does she live, son? -I don’t know. -What does she do? I don’t know. -Do you at least know her name? -I don’t know, Mahalaxmi. Then, how son? No idea what you do, but I’m fixed that she is your daughter in law. 97, 98, 99 and 100! Enough of breaking dude, come on now. Wow, it is sweet. (Chants) May your wishes come true! (Chants) -Hello! -Hello dude. -Say, man. That watch is a rare piece, it seems. They are saying too much rate. Hey, it is for Maya. Why do you start counting? Whatever may be the cost, take that. -No dude, so much high rate… -Hey, listen to me. Ok, fine! Oh no! Hi sister! Hi brother in law! Hey, why are you here suddenly? -We got 10 days holidays and we are staying here now. -Yes! -Hey Swetha! -Vaishu! When did you come, monkey? -I just came, sister. Leave it, but congratulations. -Thank you! -Congrats Swetha! -Hey shortie, you too came down? Fine, come for the party in the evening with sister and brother in law. Oh, bachelors party? Will there be drinks? -That is for sure. -Congrats Swetha. Come down by 5 in the evening, or else… Sorry Swetha, I can’t come. I’ll come two days in advance for marriage. Hello, hello! No way. Ok, bye. Please sister, let’s go. Please sister! -Let’s go! -Let’s go! You said I didn’t fit in phone that day and are now coming by my side. -Hi! -Hi! One more dude is gone! Hi dude! -Congrats, dude! -Hey, hi! -Hey, he too is here. -Hi, dude! -Thank you! -Dude! -Congrats! -Thank you! -Come on dude, let’s dance. -No! Come on dude, I’ll tell you. Come on! Dude is here, play the beat. Come on dude, continue. Dance! -What? -You and sister, dance! -No! -Huh, ask! Maya! Maya! Shall we join them? Sorry Siva, I’m a bit tired. I’ll take Deepa and leave. You come later. What dude, why did you already send sister? Hey! What’s wrong with him? Hey! What’s wrong suddenly? Oh no, you dropped it all over you. Damn! Hey, there’s a shirt in that car. Bring it. Hey, drink slowly man. Hey dude, what’s your problem? You have a good job and happy life. Why is your face like that? Happy life! By the time I felt happy as the girl I liked came into my life… What is that, dude? She is the girl you liked and your family appreciated her, what’s the problem? Marriages may take place if one likes, but family can’t run even if one is not comfortable from the both. Oh, so she is not comfortable then. Dude, there are pages called divorce in the constitution for people like you. You use them, I’m saying. Oh no, dude! If I stab you right here, there are 100 pages in the same constitution, shall I use? -No dude! No dude, sorry. -Damn, you idiot! You ask me to give divorce to my Maya? What do you know about Maya? What do you know about Maya? I’ll go and get. I too am coming. Hi Maya! I need to talk with you. You don’t know me. But I know you from six months. I wanted to tell this many times, but I was afraid. I used to return back. But I’m saying now with a small hope that you wouldn’t tell no. I love you! I like you a lot. I feel all my life would be very happy if you are with me. So… I don't know what to say. I don't even know who you are. I'm scared of all these. I'll marry the person my father shows. I'm sorry. You please don;t feel bad. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Sorry! Maya, who is he? I don’t know, but he’s following me from six months it seems. He said to be in love with me. Why did you let him go so easily, instead of giving tight slaps. Poor guy is already feeling a lot. Oh, why don’t you call your dad and ask him to fix the match? Yes, I will ask him to talk with dad. Sorry! Look there. It is just a prank, madam. -So, you are not in love with me right? -No! -So, you are not feeling bad, right? -No, madam! Thank God! I got to cry, thinking you were feeling bad. Still, why are you so sensitive? Are there girls like you even in this generation? That’s ok. Bye! Will you get ready to marry as he would feel bad? You are joining in college tomorrow and you’ll see a hundred like this. Will you do the same even then? Some guy will come across just suitable to your innocence. He will torture you very bad, keep watching. -Hey, I think seniors! -Cigarette! -Oh no, they saw us. -Hey, come here. Hey green dress, you too come here. Line! Stand in line. -Which branch? -CSE! -What’s your name? -Preethi! -Your name? -Geetha! -Your name? -Divya! -What’s your name? -Maya! Shall we get married? Fine, you go! -How is the college, dear? -Good, dad! To how many did you give dad’s number? -What is to give dad’s number? -You keep quiet. Nothing mom, she’s asking about formalities at the college. That’s all. Oh, is it? -Oh, I see! -Oh no, what’s it husband? Oh, did you give number to Rishi? Oh! Is Rishi good looking? Huh! Hey Rishi, someone is behind my girl from a week. His personality is big for me to go and talk. You must do something and set it right. Enough that you hit and make him run like you hit Sai idiot recently. -What is your count, idiot? -What count, madam? Useless fellow, move aside. -What’s yours? -98, madam! 98, single player? Single player is bore, multi-player bro. Huh, your job is great. Did you understand about count now? You say, idiot. I recently played the first match, madam. Oh no, feeling shy! Move aside! Hey, look at that babe. She looks like goddess of studies. Call her. Hey cutie! Come here. Hey, where are you going? Stand! -What is your name? -Maya! -Which branch? -CSE! Oh no, CSE! What was your EAMCET rank? -2! -Joined this college after bagging second rank? -No, 5! -25! Still, it is a top rank. -7! -257? -4! -Is it done? 9! 25,749! If another digit adds, you wouldn’t have seat in our college even in management quota. -What’s that? -Upma! How many times did you watch the film, Pokiri? Baby is Ileana and he is Mahesh Babu. Great! You eat, dude. Will you marry me? Go! -Rishi, are you serious? -Why, you have any doubt? Oh my God! Matter waves are probability waves… Alright students, time up! -Probability… -Please get in fast! -Finding a particle in space… -Nobody should stand outside. Get in fast. -Excuse me, sir. -Come in! Matter waves are probability waves… Because waves of finding probability… Guys, take your papers. -Sir! -Here! Hey Rahul, did you study well and come at least now? Or else, you do mass copying again? Be careful, ok? -What I studied should come God, please! -Here, take it. -Please! -If I see anyone copying, I’ll snatch the paper and send them out. There is no compromise in this. Come on, write. Not even one question I studied has come. Why are all these writing so much? Oh no! Question… Hey! -Is it an exam? -Yes! -You don’t know? -No! Wait! -Take it. -Oh no, no! -Hey, take it. -No, no! Take this and write. Hey Rishi! -What? -Thank you! Huh! Shall we get married? Fine, go! -Dude, bowl properly. -Wow, babe is superb. If you bowl so in practice match, how would you bowl for main match? Where do such girls be, dude? If I get her… Game will be gone. See and bowl properly. Wow, I’m so lucky. I just thought and she’s here. See what I’m going to do now. He is been chanting from so long. Hi Maya, I should talk to you. Don’t worry, you don’t know me. But I know you from six months. I wanted to say this to you from very long time. But I used to go back as I didn’t have enough courage. But I’m saying you with a hope that you wouldn’t say no now. -What else do you get in canteen? -I love you! What is this? You should give your dad’s number, right? Why are you leaving without giving the number? Maya, give me your dad’s number. Hey, Maya! Why are you hitting me, idiot? Hey! Who all watched the video, idiots? Who else want the number? What rascal, you need the number? -What? -Sorry, I don’t want. I don’t need the number. Why to give your dad’s number to every guy asking? Give my number. I’ll face all those troubles. -Thank you! -I don’t need all these thanks. Shall we get married? -Ok! -Fine, go! What did you say? “Day has come up my Lord, day has come up” “Day has come up my Lord, day has come up” “Hey heart, the behaviour has changed” ”I’ve met the rainbow now” “I saw the picture I drew in dreams directly” “I made the love flourished in heart as a word” “I said that word feeling you are the one” “I jumped in the air as she smiled and said ok” “Day has come up my Lord, day has come up” “Day has come up my Lord, day has come up” “Words have crossed the lips” “She saw today opening up the curtains” “Words have crossed the lips” “She saw today opening up the curtains” “Rare contemporary Sita has come to me” “My fate may be good, my dream has come true” “I’ll do any war for this beloved” “I’ve read Gita by Krishna many a times” “Give me the list, you need the clouds or the stars” “I’ll bring them down to you in seconds” -My favourite hero? -Nani! I should hug him and say I love you. One more thing! I should drive that car we saw then, for at least once. -You can’t drive, right? -You'll be my side, right? I should be alive after that, right? “I said that I don’t exist without you” “I jumped in air as she smiled and said yes” “Day has come up my Lord, day has come up” “Day has come up my Lord, day has come up” “Words have crossed the lips” “She saw today opening up the curtains” “Words have crossed the lips” “She saw today opening up the curtains” Boy looks good, right? That’s the match of a close family to your father. They are coming tomorrow to see you. What do you say now? I should come and talk to your dad, right? It is not a big problem to convince your dad. There are hundreds of films and thousands of references for that. Your dad will easily go flat by using a few dialogues from them. But, he’d feel bad first thinking this fellow has become more important than me, bringing up daughter for 25 years. You trust me so much knowing just for two months and don’t you see that in the eyes of your father bringing you up for 25 years? This is the mistake, lots of girls like you do. You don’t do the same mistake. Go and tell your dad, how much you believe in him and tell him you saw the same trust in me too. Any father would agree then. When someone scared me saying about ghost as a kid, I came crying to you. Then you caught my hand and gave me the courage. From then, I started holding your hand every time I was scared for courage. I was afraid every place you weren’t there. I was courageous every time you were by my side. I’m able to be the same courageous as I was with you again with Rishi, dad. You will like Rishi, dad. I liked him because I know you’ll like guys like Rishi, dad. Our marriage will take place only if you agree. Society teaches many experiences to any father having a daughter ready for marriage. After seeing so many, he gets angry when someone says to be loving his daughter. But he gets scared if his daughter says to be loving that person. But my daughter came to me and said she trusts me and has seen the same trust in another boy. That drove me here to speak with you. I feel you too will take care of my daughter with the same trust. I may not take better care of Maya than you. But, I’ll give her the same love as you gave. Still, who wouldn’t love a girl like Maya? When such a girl loves you back, will anybody let go? Uncle! Maya has great respect on you. And she likes me. Fine, ask your parents to come home. I don’t like all these. I’ll marry whomever my father shows. -All that was before she met Rishi. -Yes, correct! -Hi! -Hey, why are you here? Come on, let’s go out. Now? We are getting married in two hours. Let’s return by the muhurat time. You come. Come on! -Whose car is this? -Why do you need all that? Your fantasy and your favourite car! As you wish now! I can’t drive properly, right? I’m by your side, right? Careful! Maya! Rishi! Rishi! Rishi! Rishi! Cool down, dear! Where is Rishi, dad? I guess God gets tired of writing our fate. Maybe thus, he ends few stories suddenly. "Eyes are full of tears" "Stories of togetherness have turned false" "This burden of losing you can never be down" "It pushed me into deep pain" -You dont know driving, right? -You're by myside. I should be there after that, right? Dead will not come back and how long would you keep her unmarried? You have two girls to be married after her. There's a match I know. Mrs Mahalaxmi is a good lady. Shiva is her son. Poor mother is in the happiness of getting her son to the girl he liked. But she doesn’t know I’m not the one she liked. Dude, what was my mistake? By the time I felt happy that the girl I liked came into my life, I came to know someone else was supposed to be in that place. I’m with great hope that she’d forget her past someday and comes close to me. When would that day come, dude? When I’m thinking she is my life, she’s still stuck in her past. Dude! Don’t feel sad, dude. Hey, we don’t need courts or sections to get love. Just three words to be told with heart. I’m ready to wait lifelong for those three words. Hey, still Maya is born for me. Keep watching, she’d someday come to me herself, hug me and say I love you. -Huh! -Dude! Hey, you must’ve gone up and be dancing with Rambha or Urvashi. Here, there’s just silence in my life and no any romance. At least you say that your husband is a good man and is waiting for you crazily. You come either in her dreams or come into me. Either you make her see you in me or look at me like you. No idea what you’d do, I want Maya. -I want Maya. -Dude! -I want Maya. -Dude! -Dude! -I want Maya. -I love you. -I know, dude. -Maya, I love you. -Dude, hey! -Idli, idli! - Idli, idli! -Idli, idli! - Idli, idli! Hey, what’s your nuisance early in the morning? Not just to always eat, go and learn to cook first. Go and get coffee for me. Brother in law, I don’t think what you need is coffee to get rid of the hangover. I think you need buttermilk. Hey, slowly! Go! Siva, you too have your breakfast. Two each for you both and three for me! She loves me. “Eyes have met after so days” “Some dance started in my heart” “When babe looks at me, shall I fly in the air?” “When beloved takes my name, cyclones have shot up in me” “I can't live in this world without you” “Shall I walk with you and be your shadow?” -Brother in law! -What? Shhh! -Why are you closing her mouth? -Nothing brother in law, you go. Wait, I’ll teach you a lesson after finishing my bath. Huh, sister is changing her dress inside. -I know that, you shut your mouth. -Oh! “Coming to me and holding my hand” “My wife is swinging with happiness” “I never saw this pleasure it is a magic at hearte” “My story is fulfilled when you look at me for a second” “When you just smile, that’s enough for me” “When the sky sneaks in, by mistake” “There is always some confusion in my heart” “You don’t directly open up the heart and talk in hesitation” “Don’t you give a boon when the life is going?” “If you give a pinch of love, I’ll be with you till the end” “If you hear my words, won’t you give up silence be my companion?” “What is the comparison to heart with blue coloured glow?” “My life is become light for the smile you share” -What man, great colouring here? -Yes, dude! Wow, she is superb! Hey! Get lost, idiot. Yellow for me and red is for you, ok? What about me? Pink dress is really great. Yes, dude! -What happened, Vaishu? -He just before… What’s that look, idiot? Go, man! Hey! Hey, no dude! Who is Maya? She is your wife. Why are you so greedy then? It is ok! Someday you’ll get that chance. When will my time come? First time when I saw you… Tears in your eyes and a smile on your lips… You took the boy falling down close with love. I thought you’d take even better care of me, the guy who loved you. Before you came into my life, I rejected so many matches for a girl like you. After seeing you, can I imagine anyone else again? You came into my life, because of my mother. After knowing about your past, my love on you grew more. But you are still stuck in that past, Maya. Just for once, come out of that past and give me one chance. When you look at me… You know, I go breathless. When you called me Siva just for once, oh God I went crazy. Imagine my condition, when you call me so daily. Forget the past and come out of it, Maya. I’ll take good care of you that you’ll not remember that past again. -Sorry brother in law, sorry! -What is your over action? Why do you like sister so much, brother in law? Say like I understand and I’ll understand that. Tomorrow is your birthday, right? Luckily, it is also Valentine’s Day. You’ll not get a better chance than this. Say it. Make it fast. My dude would be coming any time. Hey, stop it. Hey, what are you doing when I asked to blow the balloons? Hey! Short rascal, move aside! Did he come? Brother in law has come. Hey, come on! Arrange it all. -He is coming. -Ready! -What? -Where are the balloons? -Take! -Happy birthday, dude! -Yay! -Happy birthday, dude! -Hey, damn you! Idiot, first birthday after marriage and I was expecting first wishes from my darling. You come over with dirty faces for everything. Move! -Dude, party! -Get lost! -Go! -What is all his over action? -Tsk! I can never forget this day. Today is the day Rishi died. I was happy thinking we were getting united in two hours. He left leaving me back alone. He took away all my hopes and happiness along with him. They don’t exist anymore in my life to share them with you, Siva. I like Rishi a lot. I’m still unable to forget that Rishi is no more. I don’t even know if I can forget that or not. You are a very good man, Siva. You are acting to be happy in front of all, though you are not happy. I cannot be happy after killing Rishi with these hands. I know that you like me. But, I don’t deserve you. I’m sorry, Siva. Wish you a very happy birthday. I was waiting she’d forget her past someday and live happily with me. She is still stuck in the past. Don’t feel bad, dude. You said she’d someday hug you and say I love you, right? That day will definitely come, dude, It’ll come. Sister, at least you understand what you are doing? Mom and dad got you into this marriage thinking you’d be happy. Not that you’d drive away someone else’s happiness. You’re killing the man alive everyday by thinking about the dead person. Poor brother in law, sister! He’s in the craze that you’d someday be happy with him. It’s wrong, sister. You are doing a very big mistake. Think just for once. Sister, brother in law is acting to be happy though he is not. Why don’t you act like you like him for brother in law’s happiness though you don’t like it, sister? What Deepu, are you too leaving? Miss you, sister! Give it here. Dude, I’ll go and drop them. Maya, I got to talk with you. Let’s go out. Shiva, I’ll drive. Shall we get divorced? Arjun! Arjun! Nothing to worry, he is out of danger. -Thank you, Doctor. -It is ok. Thank you! I’ll take care, you don’t get tensed. I love you, Arjun! Hi, mom! You said she should remember life time when you propose. Is that so bad like this?
