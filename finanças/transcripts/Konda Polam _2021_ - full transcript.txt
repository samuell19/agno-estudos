[traffic moving] [metal detector beeping] -Name? -Ravindranath Kataru. ID card please. [siren wailing at distance] Anthropology, 950 out of 1750 in mains. Highest ever score in UPSC exams. Kasinayana Mandal, Kadapa District. Drought area, right? Sir! Good to see candidates from rural India. Mr. Sharma, you can proceed. Mr. Ravindranath! If you throw a green stone into the Red Sea... what will it become? It becomes wet, sir. Smart! Mr. Ravindranath! See this chalk piece... If you dip this into the water what will happen? -Sir, if I may? -Hmm! I request you to do this interview in my regional language... as aspirants can give the UPSC Interview in English, or any regional language mentioned in the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution, irrespective of the medium of the written exam. Candidate has already requested for the interview to be in Telugu, sir. Okay! Your English seems good. Then? When we speak in another language, it reaches the brain, But when we speak in our mother tongue... it reaches the heart, sir. Well said, young man... we will continue in Telugu. See this piece of chalk. Sorry! What happens when we dip this chalk piece till this line into water? Half of that chalk piece would get wet. No. That's only half the answer. When the chalk is dipped in water the band of colours will separate... and creep to the top of the chalk piece... that is the green ink line. I noticed you drew a line with green ink on the chalk. Hmm...okay! Even though green is evident to the eye... other colours are present as well. When the chalk becomes wet, other bands of colours separate... and spread to the top portion of the chalk. This separation in bands of different colours is called chromatography. Very good! You were the topper in the preliminary and main exams... and you had countless choices IAS, IPS or IRS. Instead of opting for any of these, why did you choose IFS specifically? Only Indian Forest Services. -Yes, sir, -Hmm! You come from a family of shepherds, Your parents are illiterate. But you were still able to score the best in prelims and mains. I appreciate it. In which coaching centre did you get trained? Forest sir, Nallamala forest! You said... Nallamala forest? Sir! I'm aware of subject experts from coaching centres prepare the top rankers. But you say, forest taught you? Very hard to believe this. Mr. Ravindranath! What is your story? It's a long story, sir... If I start sharing it with you, it will take at least 2 hours. This interview is to select candidates who want to serve the nation. It is not about completing the interview within a time frame, But selecting an eligible candidate is our top priority. Okay! Let me ask you a standard interview question. Mr. Ravindranath! Can you please tell us about yourself? [passengers talking] Hello...? My dear boy. -Aren't you Gurappa's son? -Who is this? This is shepherd Gurappa's son. Is he the one who went for higher studies? Yes, his father sold half of his herd to fund his studies, That big a 'higher studies'! Where are you working now? -No job as yet, brother. -What did you say? Isn't it 4 years since you left for Hyderabad? Not found a job as yet? [bus engine revving] [blows horn] [overlap of angry voices] Severe drought! Not even 1.5" of water is getting filled. Will you break the pipe to give water to the herd? As if we did that? Water was leaking, so we gave it to our sheep. -You told us, then what? -Yes, we did. -If you change your mind? -How can you accuse us? Can't you see our wells have dried up? Where will we get water from? When people don't have enough water to drink, how can we give it to the sheep? -So shall we let the sheep die? -Calm down son. Not just 5 or 10 sheep? 100s of them... Where will you get water from? That's why we have an agreement that we will give 1 sheep for every herd? -Didn't you agree?-We don't agree now, you see? What do you mean by disregarding our agreement? -Wait, Bhaskara. -You go home. -What is the dispute? -Obvious, water problem. Is it just 5 or 10 sheep? 100s of them in herds -So what? -All of them will die, please show some mercy. Drought season Pullappa, what can we do? Find another alternative. -Hello grandma, how are you? -Have you found a job? I'll get it in due course. Find a job as soon as possible. Ma...maa? My son has come home. Why this small bag, I would've washed all your clothes? I'm staying only for 4 days. Sasi, what is the problem in our village? Mediation is going on about the taps being broken for sheep to drink water. Perennial problem, water scarcity. Grandpa, how are you? What do I lack, my dear grandson? What happened? I wanted to be present for my eldest grandson's wedding... I was lucky. By God's grace I'll be around to bless my grand daughter too. -Don't you want to attend my wedding too? -No. My dear grandson! If you bring me a wad of notes, 1000 rupee notes! Place the cash in my palm, I'll change my mind then. I would like to hold the cash in my palm real tight, Step outside, I want to flap the notes proudly and show off to everyone. Enough of your celebration. Don't dream of a feast when we don't have 1 square meal. I didn't dream anything, Your son has already put a spoke in our wheel. I just wanted to enjoy the food served on my plate, That's all. My dear grandson! Find a suitable job soon. I can't bear seeing your father so stressed and depressed. There's not even a single drop of water in our village. It is difficult to continue like this, dad. Ankayya and Bhaskar have climbed up the hillock. Matti konda, Inapasa route, Gadda Goodu Konda, the land is wet in these areas. Take a handful of soil you can make a ball out of it. Pullaya says we can take our herd to that hillock. Every herd of 50 sheep should have 1 shepherd. -Who will accompany you? -I'll go, grandpa. Why should you go? Weren't you told not to climb hills in less than an year of your marriage? Wanting an assistant, I went to the village thrice already. Who will volunteer with this constant dread of tigers attacking? Plus the fear of mountain fever. Villagers don't mind waiving the wages, and are refusing to come along. How can we protect the lives of 100s of sheep? Mother, can I go? Are you mad or what? People will spit on our face if we send you, an unmarried young girl. I will find a way somehow. Look...he is going. -Hey! -Aunt! Why can't you ask your brother to help? Call him. -Okay, aunt. -Go. [mobile phone ringing] -Hello! -Hello! Hey Ravi, not paid the room rent, who'll pay for you? I'll pay when I return. You didn't even pay last month? I'll pay the entire sum. Bro, it has rained over Nallamala forest. We need labourers for forest grazing... will you come? Grandson, sit with me. What, grandpa? Why do you think you're not getting any job? Grandpa, your question is short, but the answer is the distance from here to Hyderabad. You are not a naive simpleton. My answer will be short too. What is it? There's something blocking all your efforts, dear. -Stumbling block? -Yes! Sitting in Hyderabad, it's been a 4 year struggle for you. You shouldn't be losing so many times. You should ram your head like our sheep. You shouldn't retreat even if your skull breaks into two. But you don't make that kind of diligent effort... I haven't seen you doing so. Seer Kasinayana's pearl of wisdom, whatever the beast may be, even if you feed just a handful and make it survive... you will be blessed for a lifetime. If you save 100 lives, imagine the extent of your blessing! Whatever curse, jinx or evil eye on you... will vanish into thin air, dear. What should I do? Go with your father and assist him in forest grazing, and save his herd of sheep. If you do this, trust me you'll get a job... otherwise don't even see me or talk to me. He is such a gem of a boy and you're trying to ruin his life, eh? Keep quiet, old man. If he climbs up the mountain he has to survive on 'roti'. He has to make do with rice and raw spices. He can't even see butter, buttermilk or vegetables, let alone eat. He has to sleep on the hard ground without a care of creepy-crawlies. Get drenched in the downpour and brave the scorching sun. He has to be one among the sheep. Combat bugs, snakes and even thieves. Your grand pa just keeps talking. This old man is jobless. If your son can't find an assistant will you send your well-read grandson? Uncle, don't you have anyone to accompany you? You have given the staff to your well-read son? What is this? Why should he become a shepherd like us? Bengaluru offers so many jobs it seems... -why don't you try there? -I'll go. Hey Ravi! Did you bump into cinema actors in Hyderabad? -Did you see Anushka? -Keep quiet! Pullaya uncle, why so late? I am not late, Gurappa! It is Obulamma's fault. Look, they were born this morning. Why are you late? We have to climb before the sun scorches us, come. Uncle, cousin Shankar is not supposed to climb the hill, right? Who is coming with you? Ravi is here. Then I'll go back home. -Why? -I won't be of much use? -Why? -I never went to school... When I am capable of managing a whole herd.. he's an Engineering graduate... won't he manage your herd and mine? Why should I tag along? How are you, Obulamma? Don't call me Obulamma, It's Obu. Whatever you say. Not 'whatever'! O-bu! Okay, whatever you say, fine. Sir!... Okay, sir! Why are you late, Gurava uncle? Sun has risen, let's go, hurry up! Go...go. [herd bleating] Bless me, God. Good omen! Coconut flower. I'll talk to you later. Pullayya uncle, be careful. Govt has released 6 tigers. -They are roaming in the forest. -Let's see. They are roaming wild like the olden days. "KONDA POLAM" "Paths unfold as many a new track" "Tiger's stripes brown to black" "Paths that don't mislead the destination" "Tracks in no particular direction" "Lives in search of a living and food" "Among fangs that ruin your life" "Until you know if you'll live or die" "Let's not mere village limits, stop your progress or pursuits" "Paths unfold as many a new track" "Tiger's stripes brown to black" [tiger roars] "Lives in search of..." "a living and food" "Among fangs..." "that ruin your life" "Paths unfold as many a new track" "Tiger's stripes brown to black" "Paths unfold as many a new track" Where will you find this huge tiger? Young man! Are you scared of the Tiger? -Tiger? -Yes Really huge! With stripes all over! [tiger growls] It has sharp canine teeth! [tiger growls] With deep red eyes! [tiger growls] Hey! You go now. Remind me to take the churning stick when we go back home. We respect the tiger for its majestic image, -but there is no reason to be scared. -Ok. Go! As we graze the sheep in its territory, we pay tax by offering it prey. It isn't a 'Tiger' in our eyes, Just a big fox. These sheep... are the tiger's prey. Hey Ravi! If you see the big fox tell us, we'll deal with it. Ages since I tasted tiger's milk. Hey! You can't taste its milk. If it comes, you'll end up pissing in fright! Careful. -Jealousy! -Hey Young man! Don't be scared! Big fox isn't here. It lives in that mountains over there. "Until you know if you'll live or die" "Until you know if you'll live or die" "Let not mere village limits stop your progress or pursuits" "Paths unfold as many a new track" "Tiger's stripes brown to black" "Paths that don't mislead the destination" "Tracks in no particular direction." Pearl millet 'roti'. Want jaggery or raw onion with it? I don't feel like eating. You can't have specific likes and dislikes here. It doesn't work that way. Eat what is available and you have to sweat it out. Hey Ankayya! You have burnt your 'roti'? Subhadra has gone to her parents place. So my mother made these. Old lady's eyesight is not what it used to be. Hey! We've sighted a bear. Oh god! It is really huge. Crouch, sit down. -We should have it as a pet dude. -Yes, we should. Hey young man! Don't be scared! This fire will keep away any animal. Neither snakes nor bears will come near you. Sleep peacefully without fear. If you get scared, chant my name. 'Obu, Obu'! Hey young man... no need to be scared! They are the girl children of this jungle. They strut around comfortably as if in our living room. -Girl children of this forest? -Really! You are talking as if they are related to you? So who are the sons? Who else? The Tigers! How about the daughters-in-law? Deer and bison, -isn't it so?-True. What about sons-in-law? Who else, the wild boars. -What about humans? [in unison] -Hindrance to the jungle, just like you. All are relatives of the forest. We should come, stay for a few days and share a few meals. That's all and not be felling trees or killing the animals in the jungle. If we do, future generation won't be able to see forests, even for name sake! Oye...dhoy! Eat to your stomachs. Feast for you! This pasture is only for you. Celebrate all the festivals Pongal, Ugadi, grandmothers festival, every festive occasion. Celebrating festivals with just grass, Obulamma? -Obu! -Same thing, Obulamma. O-bu! Call me by the name I ask you to. Hey! You tease us by calling us 'Chilama, Chilama' At least you can call us 'cinema' instead. Rotten teeth fellows! What role did you play in any cinema? We stood right next to heroine Anushka. We stood with our sheep while Anushka pranced around. Gift of the gab fellows! Did you even tap your feet to the song? Of course we shook our butt like this. Shut up, you useless fellows. Your sheep will shake its tail better than you. Hey Bhaskar! Don't take a dig at us. Anushka asked us our names. When we replied Thiripelu! and Siripelu!... she started laughing non stop. Not only Anushka, looking at you, even sheep must have laughed their guts out. Hey Bhaskar! Don't these two resemble your black sheep and the grey one? -You are right.. -Look! That's Thiripelu, this is Siripelu. Both are standing there. Sna.. Sna.. Sna.. My God it's a SNAKE! -Oh my God! -Come down. What a huge snake! -Why didn't you alert us? -I did. [mimicking] What did you say? Couldn't you yell out 'snake'? Did you pee in fear? Were you controlling for so long in this trouser? I'll stitch it with elastic this time, to make it leak-proof. You are scared of snakes? We can cut it into two pieces. -Be bold. -Yes, Gurava uncle. Your youngest son is bold and brave. You want to know how bold? Snake...snake...snake! Shut up, girl. Gurappa! How did we miss such a golden chance? We should've been here when the snake slithered. -Where did it go? -Why? What would you have done? I would've caught the python by its tail and sent its head spinning to the ground. Yeah! I would've pulled its teeth out and made gravy. Stop blowing your own horn! They will trample a python lifeless to the ground it seems! I didn't bat an eyelid to spend on his education, managing the herd by myself. I ensured he got admission into a prestigious college. He has also come now to herd our sheep, uncle. His fees is equal to the cost of one herd. 4 years have gone by, he hasn't got a job as yet. Hey! -Python. -Young fellow. Nothing, don't be scared. I am here. Are you scared of a snake? With one swift blow, you can chop it into two. Look over there, the he-goat jumped. If there is a snake, the herd won't be so calm. They won't even touch the grass below their feet. They will just stare daggers. Look, uncle Gurava! I've got your python. Branch was bent, right? Stepping on it here, it just glided to the branch. If you are scared every single movement... it's not easy to be here, young man. Interview, body language techniques. SOLER! 'S-O-L-E-R' Soler! S stands for straight! Always be straight. Spine straight, sit or stand straight. O - Open posture! Don't close your hands, open...open, come sit. How do you sit in an interview? Open your hands, open your legs, this is how you have to sit. What are your 3 strengths? Reading News. Not reading News, WhatsApp forwards, Instagram posts, Twitter, Facebook. Look here! when asked about your strengths... you must say, hard work, discipline and patience. -Say it now. -Hard work. Lean forward and tell. Hard work, Discipline, Patience. Now E is eye contact. Look at me, where are you looking at? Always maintain eye contact. Always you have to maintain eye contact. Remember and R is Relax, relax. Don't be scared, it's me. What is it, father? I realize this isn't meant for you, let's go. I'll leave you by the well in Chelima. Catch the Jyothi bus and go home. No need, I'll be here. Our sheep are prey to the tiger. Those sheep should be scared. We have to allay their fears. If that fear is scaring you near a tree or on the hillock... how can you be of any help to our herd, tell me? Let's go, my son. Father, I'll stay with you. If you continue to be scared... you will be the laughing stock, son. If I leave the herd and go now... they'll still laugh behind my back. If I leave this mountain and go back home... our entire village will ridicule me. Let me stay here, father. -Listen to me, son.. -I'll stay, father. -Who is that? -Hey! -It's just us.-Why talk so late at night, sleep? -Pay heed to my words. -I don't want to go... go and sleep. Get some sleep father. "With food on his back without any qualm" "Holding his heart in his palm" "Fighting with drought day and night" "Tolerating his troubled plight" "Even if green pastures face a dry spell" "Strength in his heart wavers as well" "Holding the hand of the mountains high" "Till you know if you will live or die, failing to survive" "Let not mere village limits stop your progress or pursuits" "Paths extend left, right, front and back in sight" Obu, I just can't understand this sheep-language? Will you teach me? You want to learn to talk to our sheep? Right now? You saw how I was such a fish out of water? I have to learn, right? Then learn it. Baaa... Babaee... Ba... Bae... Baae -This? -Is it so easy? Repeat what I said. Baae... Bae... Bae -Baa baa baae. -Repeat. Baa... Bae bae... You got it, you can talk to your sheep... you are like one of the herd. [bleating like sheep] Your job is so easy! Always the same language, just keep bleating. Look at my plight, Telugu when I was born. In school I had to learn English, Hindi and Sanskrit. In college I had to learn C, C++, Java, Goa and all that rubbish. -Aunt -Oh! Did you hear the literate goat chat with the illiterate goat? -What are you saying? -Look there. Look here! Shall we go to Ameerpet? Learn C++, Java! No need, let's go to Goa. [bleating like sheep] -Baa.. -What is this? Sheep language! Why do you need to learn their language? Won't they understand your language? -How is that? -Do you graze the sheep? -Or does the sheep graze you? -I am the shepherd. -Then what? -Grand son! Haven't you noticed your father graze his sheep? -I've seen it, grandpa -Have you noticed? Not asking if you have 'seen' him, have you 'noticed' him? Whatever the work, if you observe carefully... you will know automatically. Oba... Oba! Grandson, in the forest it's not enough if you keep your ears and eyes open. You must notice and observe everything. "Green creepers and trees look like green sarees." "Thorny bushes in black like a beaded garland." "Squeaks of squirrel; chirps of sparrow sound like a lullaby you know." "Rippling silver streams are mother's milk it seems." "We are the special guest of this mountain forest." "In Mother Nature's lap flowery, we will wave away our misery." "We are the special guest of this mountain forest." "In Mother Nature's lap flowery we will wave away our misery." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will run around." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will roll on the ground." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will run around." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will roll on the ground." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will run around." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will roll on the ground." "Dhum dhum dhum! Let's ask the forest Goddess to shower her mercy on us" "We will pay our obeisance to her for protecting our lives forever" The white sheep in the centre is the freckle faced, this is the black one, jet black just like me. Hey Ankayya! Must fetch food for all of us, who is going with you? -Bhaskar and I will go, uncle. -Go ahead. You have come so soon? Hasn't Subhadra come back, Sasi? Your wife is relaxing at her parents' place. Your mother has packed food for you. How is my brother Ravi coping, Bhaskar anna? Somehow he has managed 8 days. He will come next time to fetch the food himself. He's very capable! "Like incense powder, dewy clouds above." "Their fingers they wove into our hair with love." "Branches brushing against us." "akin to amulets that caress our skin." "Leaves of the trees provide breeze like fans to make us relax with ease." "The green grass invited us unfolding like a cool mattress." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will see up and down." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will gather around." "Dhum dhum dhum! We think of this vast jungle as our house of worship." "Even before we ask she grants our wish, in her we trust; we worship, we cherish." Saar.. " To save drop by drop..." 'teaches the honey bee, to lead a healthy life and be happy." "How to be active and on our toes..." "the deer and the antelopes teach you." "The wild boar teaches us courage to brave the tiger on a rampage." "Wild dogs rap a tattoo, that unity is strength and their motto." "Animals that hunt their prey, they teach only one lesson." "Do not commit this misdeed of betraying the hands that feed." "Dhum dhum dhum! We will learn our lesson." " Dhum Dhum Dhum! We will pass it on to our next generation." "Dhum Dhum Dhum! We will follow these lessons to avoid suffering and strife." "No school can surpass our forest ever, let us walk this dream together." [wolves howling at distance] [traffic sounds] My name is Ravi! I did my engineering in KSRM... my project is about wind power generation analysis. My percentage is 78. My roles and responsibilities are... my roles... -My.. -You may go, Mr Ravi. Today's group discussion topic. Govt should help the farmers. To increase the agricultural sector's share in GDP we have to privatize it. Yeah, proceed. We went to Tadipatri for doing this. And privatization will help in bringing accountability. Besides this, what more should I say, sir? Mr Ravi, we will call you later. Why aren't you lying down? I will lie down soon. What are you so deep in thought about? What is your story? Is it a girl? No, thinking of my job. Will you get a job by sitting and thinking about it? Go to sleep! We have a job of grazing our sheep tomorrow. [herd bleats in panic] [groans] Pullayya uncle. Thieves! Thieves have crept in and hurling stones to steal our sheep. Make sure the sheep don't get startled and bolt. -Young boy, careful.-The sheep are bolting. Aim with your catapult. Sheep are getting away. Son, come here. Son, don't let them climb down. The thieves will frighten the flock, cover the sheep with their shirts and lug them on their shoulder. that's how they steal our sheep. Take out your catapults. Bloody thieving rascals! Their heads should smash. Fling the stones at them. Aim...throw. Throw the stone. Young man! There...that side. That's it. Son, you must watch each thief drown in his own blood! I'll smash your damn skulls! Bloody scumbags! Your blood will run like a river. Your head will smash to bits and pieces, that's all. Bloody scoundrels! We will drink your blood, bloody rascals! Go away. Hey! Stop. Stop... Stop. Son, they have gone, stop it. Young man, you swirled your catapult brilliantly. Siripelu! Thiripelu! where were you hiding? We aimed and threw the stones ensuring our herd was safe. Did you aim at them or at us? You hit my forehead, it is swollen now. You! We aimed only at them, What can we do if you butted in between? All that doesn't count, did we throw stones or not? Let's graze our herd here in this hillock. Those thieves may return. We should have chased them up to the mountain base. How will they come back? And fall at our feet, huh? Quite a few of them will be nursing a fractured skull... they won't disturb us hereafter. How can we assume and keep quiet? Son, our sheep are like pots of water. We are carrying them on our heads. The thieves don't have a permanent place to live. They can hatch any plan. Those thugs are like the fierce tiger. We have to make sure they don't attack our herd. That is our job. If we twirl our moustache in arrogance, they will make us their enemy. Keep quiet. Bhaskara, your sheep is climbing that boulder. Go and check. If you fall down, fracture's are inevitable, stop. God! It fell down. What happened, Bhaskara? My sheep fell down from that boulder. It is unable to stand, please check, I'm worried. Give it to me. On my lap. I think it has hurt its spine. If we were back home we can bandage its legs, support its legs with the help of a cot... it will get better in a month's time. Nothing can be done on this hillside. [sobbing] Don't cry, brother. Every pregnancy it gave birth to twin lambs. It gave plenty of milk too. What a sad plight for such a wonderful sheep? What do we do with this now? We can't abandon it here. That being said, we can't carry it on our shoulder, right? Shall we fix a price and chop it for the mutton? We've never been without eating meat for 8 days, only this time. Sometimes wild animals have even grabbed 2 or more sheep as prey. We didn't have the heart to eat at all. -Shall we fix a price? -No, I don't want to. I don't want to kill my sheep. What will you do then? Carry it on your shoulder? You shouldn't get so attached, Bhaskara. I'll carry it home and get it treated. How will you carry it all the way home? I'll take it to my uncle's house in Nayana village. They will transport it to my house. "To survive" "To make the poor animal survive" "Somehow find a way to revive" Let's go, hurry up. Bhaskar anna, don't cry. "Some way or the other try" Let's walk along that narrow stream. This tree is used to make dolls. Look how they have cut these trees down. Forest officers won't come so deep into the forest. These bloody thieves know very well. That's how they get away, cutting these trees. When labourers come right here to fell red sandalwood trees, why won't forest officers come? They have a way of earning only if our forest exists, right? Why are you asking me? They should be enlightened! Come. [alarm call of monkeys] Sssshhh! Wait. What happened? [alarm call continues] It could be a Tiger, come on. [foot steps approaching] [tiger grunts] [tiger roars] The Big one! If it catches the scent of our sheep it will head towards us. Let's make sure that sheep doesn't bleat. [sheep bleats] It isn't a young tiger. Old and experienced. [tiger growling] It's moving away. You say wild berries would have fallen down there? Hey! A tiger is here, climb onto the hillock. -Tiger, huh? -Run...hide. Run...run, climb to safety. Careful! Get ready with the sticks for the pyre. Sir, throw stones. Go... Go... Go Who are you all? We are from Varikuntla colony. Looking for neem gum, honey, roots, herbs. We roam around this mountain. Gone! It took the sheep away! That sheep has got its salvation. Let's share the loss. I literally gave it on a platter to the tiger, what our men should have got. You kept ranting 'Tiger... Tiger!' You saw for yourself now. How was it? Why, brother? Why are you chuckling? The moment I set eyes on the tiger, I felt a chill run down my spine. I have felt this same kind of fear during my job interviews. I was reminded of that. By the way, brother! Why did you come to the mountains? Weren't you working as sentries? Yes, sir. You heard Govt built us a colony near Shiva temple? We live in that colony now. Oh! Are you from that colony? Sir, it is drought everywhere, no? We often wander around in the mountains here. -Two weeks since we came to Yegamalli.-Hey! Oye! Who is there? We are shepherds, who are you? We lost our way. Are you only shepherds? Or someone else with you? Go...go. We need to talk to you. Shall we come over or will you come to meet us? Sir, don't let them come down, you go up and meet them. -What, brother? -We have to go up to Jyothi mountain. Can you tell us the shortcut? -Where are you coming from? -Western side. If you had climbed up the sand hill you would have gone straight. You are off-track now. Alright, if you go straight you will reach Rabbit hill. Once you get down, you'll be in Bandapet. Get down and walk along the bend. Let me show you. Did you see anyone from the colony? Men and women 8 people altogether. People from the colony? I didn't see anyone, did you, Ankayya? I'll show you the way now. Did you see their gun? They are red sandel smugglers. Then why were they asking about the colony residents? They are not here. Where would they have gone? That tiger isn't lucky enough to meet us. Bhaskar, if you had taken us with you... we would have taught the tiger a few lessons in courage! -What would you have done? -Tiger wouldn't have taken our lamb. -We would've taken the tiger's cub -Carry it on our hips and raise it. Uncle, why is it limping? -Check if it has a thorn in its hoofs. -Bring it here. -On your lap? -I'll hold it here. What happened? Give me your torch. -Shine it here. -Where is it? [sound of a tree falling] Looks like they are cutting red sandalwood trees. I don't know how they have the heart to do so. We saw them only 2 days ago. They have stacked it in a heap like a red hillock. Like new born babies skinned alive. I have never come across anyone who has prospered cutting trees. There are many who have become rich by cutting down sandalwood trees. So many have destroyed forests, quarried mines and become millionaires... maybe patting their own backs! That is a terrible sin. They will pay for it one day. Why should we bless or blame? It has been a week. The day after, in the morning we must go to Varikuntla to bring food for us. Son, you said you had to call someone in Hyderabad... -will you go? -Yes, father. There, over there. You can see them as small figures busy cutting down the trees. Look. [trees continue to fall] Ravi, Obu and I will be in the village for the next 8 days. Shall I tell your mother to cook something? -Munemma, how are you? -I am fine! -How about you? -I am fine. Why haven't they come as yet? Spicy 'dosa' with a spoonful of ghee. -Hello! -Sir... -Who is speaking? -This is Ravi... -Ravindranath.-Ravi, your phone was switched off? I had gone with my father to the forest to herd sheep sir. Can't charge in the mountains, so I left my phone at home. Sheep? -How can I help you? -Sir... -interview results, sir.-Doubtful you'll be selected... -let's look at other options. -Why isn't Subhadra back as yet? She will come, don't worry. -Hello! -Sir, let me know if there's any job. You are not able to clear any job interviews, right? Doesn't matter however small, sir. -Alright. -As long as it's a job, fine. Okay, I'll look into it. Fine, sir, thank you. Young man! Sorry! Why? I took the liberty of teasing you in the mountains, right? Doesn't matter. When I look at you I always feel a bit of envy, and a bit of anger. Why should you be jealous of me? I wanted to study too. After my parents passed away, I started herding sheep. But you studied without giving it up. -That's why I envy you. -Why angry? When an educated man prefers being a shepherd, won't I be angry? Dumbo! When I was young my father used to say, only if you step into someone else's shoes... you will know the number of thorns in it. Now I understand. The kind of problems you are facing unable to find a proper job. That's why I said sorry. Hey! Here they come. "Here she comes, Chithrangi" "Here she comes, Chithrangi" "She looked at me, Chithrangi in wide eyed wonder, this lady" Oh, Munemma! "Here she comes, Chithrangi" "Here she comes, Chithrangi" "She looked at me surprised, Chithrangi" Wretched fellows! Not given up their booze habit. "Chithrangi" -"Chithrangi" -Hasn't Subhadra come? Subhadra didn't come, she is in her mother's house. Your mother has packed food for you. You wore an ironed shirt expecting to see your wife. Keep it safe inside. Has our soil become wet with the rain? THE SOIL? Muddy enough for you to roll! Even if I lose a single sheep in my flock, I'll snip your tongue! Do so, I don't care... Ranga! Take good care of our herd and our grandfather. Rs 200 per day, don't fight with me later. Churning stick to mash your lentils. -Father has sent this for mom. - Alright. Grandma has ground 2.25 kilo of pearl millet to make 'roti' for you. It will be enough for 8 days. -I've packed onion and jaggery. -Hey! Sasi Your brother has become an expert. You don't have to elaborate. Come. -"Garnished dosa with love and ghee" -Eat... Eat. Sister! Give me coins for Rs 10. You dropped the coin, pick it up. Brother, I have to make a call. -To whom? -To my mother-in-law. Tell me the number brother. 94-46- -Forgot, huh? -Wait! White sheep Narige-palla, it's 12... Muchchu, 37... Narigae- 45, that's the number. 'Sheep-math' is super. Hello! Speak. Hello! Who, huh? Your husband! I thought you'll make the 'roti' for me at least for the 2nd week. You are still sitting at your mother's house? Does this seem fair to you? You intend living there? Lifelong, huh? God's sake, why? You are my wife, my child's mother. How can you stay there for so long? Dear! What did I say wrong? Have I ever been rude to you? I am a mad man whose world is only sheep and lambs. I married you because you've studied up to 10th standard. How am I in the wrong? Why? What wrong did I do? Yes, I know... I should have gone with you... I should have accepted the new dress your parents bought for me, I couldn't accompany you What do you want me to do? To quench the thirst of our herd... we herded them to Vankamarri dam, luckily we found some water in the ditch there, we gave that dirty water to our sheep. Your father's younger brother's daughter's wedding. Your sister and as good as sister-in-law to me. Because I was not by your side you would have cut a sorry figure. What can we do now? Our mayila sheep had a problem during her delivery... the lamb was in breech position, it suffered all day. My dear, listen! When you were expecting we admitted you in a hospital. Doctors had to operate on you to deliver our baby safely. You didn't even open your eyes, you were unconscious and so weak, I didn't even want to look at our new born baby. My heart almost stopped, worried about your condition. One look at you, I almost had a black out. I cried inconsolably. I hit my chest in anguish and wept. People around me in the hospital with astonishment and amusement. Even then I couldn't control my tears. My dear! We had doctors to attend on you. They operated on you. Does that sheep have any doctor? Which hospital can it be admitted in, Subhadra? It kept bleating in pain till sunset, then breathed its last in agony. The unborn also died. I just sat there numb and wept the whole day. The same way I cried at the hospital for you. Now you know why I couldn't come. Listen, dear! Because my mother has poor eyesight 'rotis' she packed for me... were completely burnt. That's on one side, The food she packed for me wasn't cooked well enough, I had indigestion after eating it. If I didn't eat, hunger pangs gave me stomach cramps. During the day, I survived on wild berries, Mangoes, passion fruit or any fruit I could lay my hand on. I had to eat something to survive, my dear. After going through all this misery what wrong am I guilty of? Please come back. Come back home at least for the 3rd week. Dear! It rained here, I climbed downhill to the plains. If I know you aren't back, I won't step into our house. Who else is there for me, huh? Hold it brother. Brother, I'll make 'dosa', eat and then go. No sister, I will go back to the hills and eat my 'roti'. Thiripelu, where did this damn dog hide when the tiger came? -In between the sheep's legs! -Darling dog! I've never heard you bark... why don't you bark at least once? Both of you keep barking 24 hours, why are you annoying the poor dog? Bow-bow bow-bow. Bloody buffoons! Brother! -Have some. -No, brother. I was totally oblivious of the fact you were suffering like this, it took me so long to know. How can you eat burnt bread? Please eat this. The girl you marry shouldn't be clinging to you and falling at your feet. She should hold your hand and walk with her head held high. Just like Subhadra. I am the one who is mad. Brother! If you get a girl like her, don't miss that golden chance. -Ba...bae -[lamb bleats] Isn't Obu, that golden chance of a girl? Young man! To appease the Rain God... our villagers are making 'lentil rice' as sacred offering. Munemma and I will be going back to the village for a whole week. Don't be scared because I am not around. -If you get scared. -I'll chant 'Obu, Obu.' You are on the right track now. Hey Ameerpet! What will Obu be doing now? "Take a handful of beans, peel the skin off the seeds" "here is your salad treat." "To be held in his palm warmly like the shepherd staff firmly.." "this bamboo basket yearned maidenly." "O!... Obulamma" "As beautiful as a wooden doll finely chiselled slim and tall." "When the sun rises, early morning life long a rhythm to adorn." "Only your name never to depart, now a constant chant in my heart." "A new feeling, never-before rhapsody assaults me, making me forget my body" "sleep to my eyes so elusive has become a distant relative." "When both their eyes listen intently when the girl's eyes speak to me" "in the dizzy spin of sharing words and thoughts so caring." "Who bonds with whom well, which are the places they travel" "in those turning points of life to revel." "Has he deciphered cleverly the dreams embedded in me?" "day and night, he follows me like a shadow faithfully." "He has occupied readily the cave of my heart steadily." "Even if I ask him to leave me he refuses stubbornly." "O!... Obulamma" "You are like a flower sweet in a bouquet of floral feast." "When sun sets for night to descend, life long a count missed till the end" "only your name never to depart now a constant chant in my heart." "A new feeling, never-before rhapsody spears my senses to hypnotize me" "sleep to my eyes so evasive has become a distant relative." "O!... Obulamma" "As beautiful as a wooden doll finely chiselled slim and tall." "O!... Obulamma" "You are like a flower sweet in a bouquet of floral feast." "If the stomach is full..." With such big stones, we twirled our catapults and sent our missiles, Tiripelu and Siripelu made them flee with their tail tucked between their legs. "If the stomach is full the brain will chill" "If the brain is chill life will never be dull" Boys, don't scare our sheep! Watch your step. "If the brain is chill.." -Looks like some animal got trapped. -Not an animal, sir. Jungle fowls! Came to drink water. Where are the others? -They have gone to collect honey. -Is that so? Brother, you were terrified of them the other day. You bolted away, why? How can we be alive if they set eyes on us, sir? What will they do? They have ruined our children's lives. They are rotting in jail's. -Why? -Red Sandalwood case, sir... Non-bailable offence. We are caught between the police and the smugglers. How are you connected with the smuggling? If we are caught by those sandalwood thieves... they will hold our wives and children as captives, and force us to be bonded labourers. If we get caught by the police, they will frame us in some case or the other. We know the tree count, where rooted and the route to lug them out safely, we know it all sir. That has become our curse too. With my own hands, they made me cut the trees which were like my children. We can't afford to be seen by them. We have left our home. we live in the mountains. We are not scared of the mountain, sir! We won't get caught. We may not get square meals a day... this forest is our mother. If we don't find food, we lick some honey and appease our hunger. No one can solve this, son. When you feel hungry... share our simple meal with us. Come... Come, let us all sit together and eat, come on. Each one of us is herding at least 50 sheep. We are their only support. Why should we carry this new burden? Sir! We know who hurled stones at you. -Who was it? -Those sandalwood smugglers. Those who are cutting the trees in the east. They threaten people like you who come to the mountain... steal your sheep and have a feast. We saw them using catapults on you. We should thrash them. Scoundrels! Not just that, we have to smash their skulls. They stole 4 sheep previously... worth rup...rupees 30,000. What is it? Why are you whispering? Tell us also. -Those thiev.. -Don't, he is a bit weird... e'll put a spoke in the wheel. Don't tell even the elders, they'll be petrified. Do you know where I can find them? We know, sir. Sir! We also know the silent path to creep in on them. They are 40-50 in number. Young man! Young man! Let it brew and boil Why are you stirring it? Don't drink too much, we have to cut down trees now. -What happened, brother? -Tied him up for 4 days, he fell in line. 360 sandalwood logs! We took them from under the nose of the police. No one whispered a word. Now just watch, all we do is point our finger... police officers themselves ensure the trees are cut. [chirping like birds] Who's that? Hey! Who is it? Who is throwing stones at us? When we lay our hands on you, we'll kill you. Check the other side. Who's that? They are aiming at us from the front. Get them all. They are finished today. Hey! Start the tractor. Turn the head lights on them. Turn it. Turn it quickly. Who the hell are you guys? Turn... Turn! Bloody rascals! Whoever you are, wherever you go I will get all of you at sun rise. Tomorrow morning, I'll make sure you are dead. -Found them? -Bloody thieves! Did you find some one? Turn... Faster. There... Over there. Hey! Balance it. Turn... Turn. Those scoundrels are lurking somewhere around. Hey! Walk quietly. There he is, get him. -Brother, we caught one of them. -Tie him up. Scoundrel! Is everyone safe? They may come back when we stop our attack. Let's get out of here, we'll lie low meanwhile. Dear son! My dear son! Where are you my boy? My son! Hey! Put some more. It tastes so bitter. Bhaskara, wasn't my son with the rest of you last night? Where has he gone? Er...er...he must have gone that way, uncle. Uncle, he has gone to the hillock to spy on the sandalwood smugglers. Why go to the hillock? No...no...nothing. We beat them to a pulp last night, but still my heartbeat is racing, uncle. Let us tell grandpa and uncle, If they come back and attack us? How can they attack? Hey! Just shut up, you and your snake-sharp ears! Hey! You two. -What do we tell him? -What secret are you whispering? Say something. Tell him, uncle. Tell him. Pullanna, the thing is... last night, after everyone went to sleep... What happened? After everyone settled down to sleep... Then what happened? The... The thing is... after everyone lay down to sleep last night. Stop repeating and tell us what happened. Hey! Actually after everyone went to sleep last night... -For heaven's sake tell us the rest. -Uncle! What happened after everyone went to sleep? Hey Ravi! Here he is... You are yelling at me? Ask him yourself. Where did you go this early? I went to get passion fruit from the plains, father. -Then where are the fruits? -There are no trees in the plains. Then why did you go down? Only after I went down, I realized there were no trees. Huh? What is this? -Where did you go leaving us? -I will punch you, I am as scared as all of you. I told you I was climbing to the top to take a look, eh? Yes, you did, but when uncle asked me, I clean forgot. We would have got caught. -You could've bought more time. -Hey! We have to go and get food for everyone. And come back before the afternoon sun hits us. Yes, grandpa. -Let's go. -I'll die if you don't tell me... What happened last night? -Last night I had a dream. -What dream? When I plucked the sheep's fur it turned into gold. Really? REALLY! He mistook the branch to be a snake and got scared -Yes dear! -Bhaskar even checked if he urinated. "Go to the well, dear to fetch water crystal clear" "Rub it on the stone to clean make fish gravy for me to feast" "Fish is only for me you can have the gravy!" Why are you so late? None of the others have come with you? Hasn't Subhadhra come? No, but your mother has made 'roti' for you and sent it. Ironed shirt, keep it safe for next time. Everything good with the herd? Give me the cash, settle our account. -I'll pack the food for you. -Alright! Here, count it... -Rs 1600. -You counted right? What is it? Why are you staring at me so intently? -Me? -Yes... Who else? I didn't become so slim and fit doing only household chores... nor have I become plump stuffing myself like a glutton. I am just the same as how I was when I went. You don't have to weigh me, under scrutiny! Whatever you say. Saar! Subhadra! Hold the baby, he keeps crying. I wanted to go home yesterday. He had temperature, It hasn't subsided. I hitched a jeep ride from my mother's house, and came straight here. Somehow eat the 'roti' packed now. I'll cook a good meal and send you next time. Lord Hanuman amulet from Gandi. I tied it for you, last year when you went up forest grazing. This one will protect you now. Dear! Who is the head of our house, you or me? You are educated. You know to maintain our income and expense. You should be the one to run our family. This was our agreement before we got married, right? I made a mistake. It wasn't deliberate, right? No. Despite having a pen for the sheep... will anyone miss out on his brother-in-law's function? You had to lose face in your house because of me. Don't feel bad! I can't bear seeing you upset like this. What can you do, if we are facing a severe drought? Go up to the mountain and come back soon. Your son and I will wait here for you. Ankayyanna, you want to come with us or want to stay behind? What about our sheep? -How are you doing? -See you later. Take care and come back safe. I'll see you soon. What is news back home, sister? Konda Narayana died by consuming pesticide. -Why? -Five years since we had rains, right? Drowning in debts, fees for his children... and his daughter's wedding expenses. How unfair life is! When will we see another good samaritan like him? No one knows how many lives this drought will end up taking. Why are they sauntering like a bride and groom? Everyone in our village is talking about you. Why is an educated man managing the herd? What did you say? I told them the actual fact. What is that? At first, he was like a hen cooped under a basket. Now he has become the trump card. Look at that. Blushing! [vehicle approaching] Hey! Who are you? -We are shepherds, bro. -From which village? A village near Porumamilla. I have seen them before. Yesterday, last night, or this morning, did you come across any new faces? Why? Can't you talk? Seeing you I got tongue-tied, I just relieved myself, otherwise I would have pissed in my 'lungi'. We saw some outsiders on the mountain top. They attacked us last night. We drove them away with our guns. If they attack you, they will grab your sheep. Give it serious thought and tell me the truth. Last night, I saw someone... by the well in Chelima, brother. Were they carrying guns? I couldn't see, but probably tucked in their waist. How many of them? Around 20-30 men. -Who do you think? -No idea, brother'. Maybe police, I thought. In that case, their jeeps will be parked somewhere in sight, right? Not police, some other gang. Or else maybe Naxalites. Okay! If you come across anyone, just whistle a couple of times to alert us. Okay, brother. Hey! Let's go. The moment I saw them I was terrified, brother. Good thinking on your part, to confuse them by saying police and naxals. From now on they won't cut our sandalwood trees... and be on tenterhooks. Wretched crooks! Why are you looking at me so intently? Giving up your trousers and wandering in this 'lungi'... you are a handsome looking fellow, I swear. Brother, how does he look in this 'lungi'? Like one of our wild sheep. Apt description! In the last 8 days, did you think of forest grazing? Sheep... Shepherds! Did you remember any of these? When did I ever forget? Even if I was physically present at home... my mind was always on the mountain. The first few days... I was talking even to the chicken as if I was herding sheep. On another occasion... I forgot we had a cot... I swept the floor clean and slept on the hard floor happily. "I climbed up the tree nimbly my beau, to get you sweet honey." "Smacking your lip will you savour every sip?" "A bunch of tiny flowers I brought in a basket for you, my forget-me-not." "For my sake, will you wear the flower you like on your hair?" "Weaving my sari with stars countless" "Weaving" "Spreading moonlight as our mattress" "Spreading" "With my eyes lit like a lamp bright" "I am waiting for you in earnest delight." "I climbed up the tree nimbly my beau, to get you sweet honey." "Smacking your lip will you savour every sip?" "A bunch of tiny flowers I brought in a basket for you, my forget-me-not." "For my sake, will you wear the flower you like on your hair?" "When you and I are about to unify..." "did you see my heart race at a dizzied pace?" "In joy when our heartbeats quicken..." "will you join the rush of my adrenalin?" "Kindly turn a deaf ear to crickets chirping, dear." "Don't perk up your ear to the rooster crowing, dear." "Without any other activity in place..." "I will sleep always in your warm embrace" "Listing this and that endlessly another day has dawned for you & me." "While I bathe and freshen up gaily will you be waiting for me daily?" "At your service for a century." "I climbed up the tree nimbly my beau, to get you sweet honey." "Smacking your lip will you savour every sip?" "A bunch of tiny flowers I brought in a basket for you, my forget-me-not." "For my sake, will you wear the flower you like on your hair?" "Weaving my sari with stars countless" "Weaving" "Spreading moonlight as our mattress" "Spreading" "With my eyes lit like a lamp bright" "I am waiting for you in earnest delight." "I climbed up the tree nimbly my beau, to get you sweet honey." "Smacking your lip will you savour every sip?" "A bunch of tiny flowers I brought in a basket for you, my forget-me-not." "For my sake, will you wear the flower you like on your hair?" Pullaya uncle! Aren't you planning to get Obu married? I intend to. Will any of our boys be a suitable groom? When it comes to fixing an alliance. Can't discriminate as our clan and outsider. Why not? What is there to analyse? Whether alliance or election we prefer our own kind, but we only get duped. Listen, dear I won't accept a son-in-law who's a farmer or who is into forest grazing. If I do, she will only see stones and thorns in her lifetime, No way will I consent to it. Not a rupee more. Not a rupee less. I will get Obulamma married only to a man with a secure job. Whether flood or famine, only the man who earns a decent salary will marry her. If need be, I'm prepared to sell my entire herd. Suddenly the tiger and wild boar came face to face. The wild boar had canine teeth on both sides. Once it barged into the herd... sheep ran helter-skelter and got scattered. [tiger growling] [sheep bleats] [sheep bleats] Oh God! The kid is following its mother. [sheep bleating] -What happened? -Maybe the tiger lost its way. Entangled in the branches... tiger and sheep have fallen on either sides. Which side did the tiger fall? Where are you going? -Young man, don't go. -Ravi, where are you going? -Don't go, son. -Don't go Ravi. Ravi, come back. Tiger...tiger. -Ravi, don't go. -You come away. Don't go. -Ravi! -Don't. Don't go near the tiger. Son, come back. Come up, come back. Come up. Ravi come back. Come out of there. Don't go after the tiger. -Young boy! -Young boy! The Tiger is coming for you. Doesn't matter if we lose one sheep. [tiger growling] Hey! Hey!... -Hey! -Don't go, son... Tiger has clutched its prey any way, don't. Hey! Careful. [tiger growling]Hey Ravi! Just come back. Ravi! Come back. -Don't do that, listen to me. -Young man! No. No! No! Listen to me Ravi No, don't try to fight. [tiger roaring] [people screaming] -Ravi, hold on. -Ravi, don't. Young man! Hey! Tiger has set its mind on this prey Don't try to save the sheep. Listen to me so, please come back. You may fall. Don't take this risk. Son, come back. Don't risk your life. What is this, my son? Why did you do this? Come back! He wanted to save the mother for this kid, so he jumped. Damn! -What happened? -We thought we'll drink tiger's milk. -You saw it, no? -But it was a male tiger. Good-for-nothing fellows! Hey! What are you thinking about? I was thinking when will I leave this mountain and go back to Hyderabad. When the skies open and it rains non stop. Not just a slight drizzle here and there,. Non stop downpour for at least 4 days. Leaves of trees with droplets of water, ground should be wet, it should cross the mountain and flood our village too. Then all of us can go. Hey! Who is it? I am asking? and no one is answering. -Who are you? -Asking me this question? You are in our land and asking me who I am? Didn't you recognize us? Obula Lord Narasimha is the groom of our house. We are His brothers-in-law. Goddess Lakshmi's brothers. Oh! You, huh? Yes, old man don't you remember? Long ago Lord Narasimha bequeathed these hills to us. You have to pay us tax when you cross Squirrel mountain. You have crossed it. You should have paid at least at Merava hill. You crossed that too and hence we are here face to face. How much is your tax? Don't you know, Old man? You are mountain grazers. As if you don't know? What is this? I thought you were a gentleman, is it fair to do this? When have we ever accepted paper currency? Then what do you want? You must pay grass tax. You have to handover the sheep which grazed on our grass. What will God do with hard cash? If it is a question of sheep, then he will accept it as sacrifice. How many animals does your brother-in-law want? One sheep from every flock. Oh my god! 10 sheep, huh? We already gave 10 sheep to your brother-in-law. Whom did you give the sheep to? Who took it without our knowledge? How can you ask that, son? We gave it to Lord Narasimha, near soil mountain. He came in person and took our sheep. Bhaskar, didn't he come near the pond and take them? What, brother? Lord Narasimha came out of the temple and he took your sheep, is it? Yes, brother! When the deity inside can send you to collect tax... why can't he come and collect in person? What is this? Sarcasm? Yes, same to you. Showing scant respect to us? Are you equating the tiger's prey with our grass-tax? They are the guardians of what's left of our forest, so we pay grass tax to the tiger. What's your problem? Can't you work, you buffalo? Brother! Old man, you are crossing decent limit. You don't know about us! If we decide we can take your entire herd with us. Brother, I don't know who you are. I don't understand why you think our herd will follow you. No way is this forest your inherited property. Just leave. -What? -Want to know? Forget the sheep! not even a single strand of fur will follow you. We are herding them forsaking our own lives. When the tiger took one of our sheep... we challenged it and took it back. Why would we care you? Leave now. Do whatever you want to. -Hey! Old man? -Clear out now, jobless jerks! You lost Rs 200, find your way back. You bunch of lunatics! Even if you had given us one sheep we would have left you alone. Men will come armed with bows and arrows tomorrow. They will make your herds jump from mountain to mountain. Will your arrows fly farther than this? Not just us, there is another herd on Jyothi mountain... with at least 20 shepherds. Just one call they will come to our aid. All of them have catapults. If you want to come you are most welcome. Clear out! -Son! -Gurappa! It is better if you divert the herd towards the eastern hills. Rather than being caught and suffering here... let's go to safe place and have the last laugh. Come... Come... let's head for the eastern range. Come son. let's go. Let's go. The thieves escaped because Ravi aimed at the trees with his catapult. If we had aimed instead, they would have fallen at their doorstep. If we had aimed roughly too, it would have hit their 'lungi'! -What say? -Of course! Bloody braggers. You won't get mountain fever if you boil the water you drink. Educated young man... are you condemning this water? Once, we only had a handful of water. Worms were swimming in it. We dipped a cloth lengthwise, Wetted our parched lips with it and managed to survive. We haven't faced that kind of water scarcity in this forest grazing. The hollows are filled with water. Ravi, we should thank this water for our brain power. Drink...drink, you will become as brainy as us. Brainy, my foot! [chuckles] [Obulamma gasps] Bee hive... -Aunt, Honeybees! -Aww! Ouch! Ah! They're biting! -Brother, cover up! -Cover up! Listen... hey... You must not move when under the attack of honeybees. Are you stung? Let me see. Looks like its stinger is still there. It's alright, Obu. Shh! Let me check. "In you, in me" "Within you, within me" "In you, in me" "Within you, within me" "In our breaths combined duly" "A deep desire to cross limits unduly." "Within you, within me" "In love delightfully divine" "I carried with me peace sublime that made me forget time." "Within you, within me" "In my heart's love-alcove, In streams that ripple and flow" "In love's harvest Whether bad or best" "I forgot myself in me truly" "So potent is the love-shower on me" "In an eaglet flying above" "Or in honey bees golden yellow." "In our breaths combined duly" "A deep desire to cross limits unduly" "Within you, within me" "Within you, within me" "In the flush of youth anew" "In every nerve and sinew" "When my cheeks blush with the adrenalin rush" "When waves of passion" Hey young man. "Ignite a love-invasion" Why don't you say something instead of being so quiet. "In the lake; playing spree" What should I say? "Crystal clear carefree" You tell me. "Come here" You should tell me. "I invite you, dear" Go ahead, speak. "My darling beau" You tell me. You tell me. Go on, tell me. You tell me. Do we help with the talking part? "In love delightfully divine" "I carried with me peace sublime that made me forget time" "In my heart's love-alcove In streams that ripple and flow" "In love's harvest Whether bad or best" "I forgot myself in me truly" "So potent is the love-shower on me" "In an eaglet flying above" "Or in honey bees golden yellow." "In our breaths combined duly" "A deep desire to cross limits unduly." If it begins to rain we will have to go back home. Ravi will go to Hyderabad from there. You think he will remember us? Why not? Didn't we spend so many days together? How can he forget u-- Well, how would I know? Why ask me? Ask that young man himself. I'll do that, dear. I'll ask Guranna. -You ask your Pullaya. -Ask what? I am fully aware of what's going on. Share what's in your heart with your grandfather. He may plan something different otherwise. [sheep bleating] [deer bleating] It is coming this side. The tiger is heading here! Ankayya, turn the herd the other side! Tiger is closing in on the deer! Ankayya, Bhaskara Get the herd out. We must stop the he-goat. Otherwise the kids and mature ones will follow. What happened? -Let's go check. -Alright, go. Turn the flock the other way. [herd bleating] Pullappa, careful. [deer bleating] Mom! Mom! Go! Go! Go! [deer bleating] Mom! Mom! [Obu signalling the herd] Drive some of them towards the edge of the hill. [deer bleating] [tiger growls] [tiger growls] [signalling herds] [Obu signalling herds] [Obu signalling herds] Za...zaa Which direction is this? Where are we? Where has grandpa and others gone with the flock? I saw the herd climb up the hillock. They have followed the flock. [whistling] [whistling] [whistling] [whistling] [catching breath] [whistling] [whistling from far] [whistling from far] Ravi, our people are there. [Ravi whistling] [whistling] Hey! Hey! -Hey! -[whistling] There they are! Oh uncle...Obu! -Ravi! -Ravi... -Oh Gurava uncle! -Siripelu! [Siripelu laughing] -Come... come. -Obu... You are here, eh? -Where are the others? -Where are the others? -Where have they gone? -Where have they gone? Dump your madness into a furnace! Which side did my grandpa go? What about the herd? -That way. -This way. Tell us properly which side There or here? -Here -There Hey! Pointing at random directions? How will you prosper in life? Uncle, do you know how we will prosper? I don't know! Then how will you prosper, uncle? -Ah you idiots-- -Uncle, look there. Here he comes prancing! 'Where was he hiding scared of the tiger?' Uncle, is he born from dog or sheep? A royal dog! Be it tiger or any fierce animal our Raju's hackles will rise! Opens his mouth, sticks out his tongue and pant loudly. He will keep his mouth shut saving up energy by not barking. A royal dog it is! Shut up! One day he will have his moment of glory. [dog panting] We would have covered 5-6 miles by now, father. If their flock crossed the same distance, we must be 10 miles apart. -Hey! -[in unison] Yeah? Maybe they are down that hill. -Let's go. -Come on. "Tastebud's expectation" "searching for food even as ration" "Hunger's searing torture" "ruins life for sure" Water is nowhere to be found. Looks like the water sources have dried up. We may not be able to graze animals any longer, son. No water here either. God is being unkind to us. How can man survive, if he is tested and tortured like this? I'll graze my herd of sheep as long as I have the strength in me. I am worried only about you, son. Fear grips my heart. [groans] Drat this slipper! Uncle, the sheep are parched without a drop of water since yesterday. Let the sheep rest right here. Over those hillocks... let us check for some water bodies. Otherwise, they will die. -Hey Obu! -Yeah! Son... Keep an eye on our flock. Stay right here. -Alright, uncle. -Okay. Uncle, let the 3 of us go in 3 different directions. Then 3 more people have to come in search of us! Ravi, Obu and you find another man and come in search of us. Yeah, alright. [herd bleating] -Young man. -Yeah. You are struggling to get a job it seems. What is that job? A computer job. What work should you do? There is a job. But you won't understand. Why seek a job which no one understands? Everyone studies now for that job no one understands. Is that so? If I look at you... I feel so sorry for you. By the way, I wanted to ask you earlier. If you had studied... ...what job would you have chosen? Hmm... Not a job like yours which no one understands. Not a lifeless job. I would have chosen a job brimming with life. What is that? Yes, young man! I'll work amidst plants and trees. A job amidst our people. I will teach them the alphabets I know. I will get to know their difficulties. And what alphabets would you teach? The ones the forest taught me. The forest taught you? The forest is like an encyclopedia. I don't know about what you studied, but whatever I learnt is from the forest around me. Each hill and tree here has a story of it's own. If you know that, it is as good as understanding life. Written exam is not a problem. But the interview is a nightmare! [scoffs] From this forest, I have to go to the concrete jungle! It is very scary. I don't even know why I get scared. -At least this time- -Uncle! Did you find the water hole? Can't find water anywhere. We chose these wretched hills of all places... and jeopardized the life of these creatures. Don't worry, father. What can you do? We don't have water to drink either. A day and a night. A whole day has passed by. They can't withstand thirst. They are tender creatures. [Gurava panting] I have some water left, uncle. You can drink. How can I drink when so many creatures are suffering with thirst? Hey! Where is water? You think I have water on my lap for you? Go! Why are you nudging me? [sheep bleats] May it get a dreadful disease and die! Because that deer intruded into our herd, we are in this mess. What did the tiger do to you? In panic, we came running to save ourselves. I'm carrying your problem on my head, move away. I'll kill you. Now our lives are at stake Get away from me! Off you go! Get lost! Damn you! If I throw this stone at you, your skull will shatter to pieces. Your head will smash to a pulp. Go away! [gurava sobbing] They are going to die without water. Where will we go? Uncle, look at that hill over there. Our animals are rejoicing in anticipation knowing it is about to rain! It will rain now, uncle. It will rain soon. It will rain now. -It will rain anytime soon. -It will rain. Hey! Black-face sheep, clouds have gathered, you can quench your thirst. It is about to rain Ravi, it will rain now. Hey! It's gonna rain! Wise man Kasinayana, you have saved us from drought and misery. Our salutations to you, o' seer! Young man, why don't you wake your father up? Father... father... What has happened? Father...? Father... father? Get up, father. What is wrong, father? Looks like uncle is suffering from mountain fever. Nothing is wrong with me, son. -What to do now? -Take him down to the plains. Admit him in a hospital, Ravi. -Uncle, is your entire body aching? -Careful, Father. -Uncle. -Come. -Uncle! -Careful, father! Nothing to worry, I can walk by myself. Slowly, father. Uncle, it is mountain fever Get treated at a hospital. While searching for water yesterday.. I must have been bitten by a mosquito. Ravi, take him to the plains carefully. Don't worry about your flock. We'll take good care. -You take care. -Okay. -We have got a new lease of life. -Father... I have been to so many mountains. But never have I seen a tiger in such a frenzy. Careful, Uncle! It was growling and gazing into your eyes. Obulu, keep an eye on the tiger, it may return. Alright, uncle. -Take good care of our dog. -Alright, Father. It is an extremely courageous dog. It will forsake its own life for us. [birds chirping] Let me see if I can stop some vehicle. -Huh? -Alright. Careful. -Son. -Father? Don't make a mistake. -Mistake? -Don't do mistake! What mistake, father? That girl is losing her heart to you. And you are encouraging her. Father? I am watching everything. She is such a gem. Like a naive mountain goat. You'll be here for a few days and then go away to Hyderabad. If you ditch her after showing her dreams of life... ...she will be devastated. [no voice] [no voice] Son. How will I even ask Pullayya uncle if my son can marry his daughter? If we get a jobless groom as a proposal for our Sasi ...will we agree? You can't even support yourself. How will you take care of her? Uncle, couldn't get an auto or bus. A tractor from the 'Ashram' is going to the village. My dear son. I have never seen that girl shed a single tear. She shouldn't cry because of us. One day just in case... I have to support either of you, I'll choose only Obu's side. Don't even make that mistake. Maintain your distance. Uncle, come! Get in, father. Slowly, uncle. Give me your staff. Father, careful. -Drop him in his house, bro. -Alright. Why are you taking it off? Careful, old man Cover yourself with this. It will be very cold. Uncle, I'll take good care of your sheep and your son. -Consult the doctor. -Don't worry. Take care. Hold this. Don't be upset. Uncle will be fine. Let's go. "Will stories as stories be?" "Will dreams remain as fantasy?" "Will stories as stories be?" "Will dreams remain as flight of fancy?" "Is dark forest the boundary for this never ending story?" "Say no without hesitation" "O' mind, don't ask for a reason or any sort of explanation" "As alms, I asked your love, won't you give it to me now?" "Will stories as stories be?" "Will dreams remain as fantasy?" "Is dark forest the boundary for this never ending story?" -Here they come! -Is it? [in unison] Obu! [in unison] Ravi!. Obu, we saw an iron look out-tower. Standing there, we can see the entire forest. Where? -There. -Here. Dump your brain in the furnace! There or here? -There! -There! -Obu, careful! -Alright. -It's awesome! -True. It's built for us. We can see the entire forest area. You see that side, I'll see this side. Hey! Look over there! Young man! Look at that tortoise hill. They have even lit a fire. -They must be our clan. -Yes, our people! -Hey! Pullappa. -Bhaskara. We can go by tomorrow morning. Alright. Young man. Won't we meet our family tomorrow morning? Yeah, so? After that, you have to speak to my grandpa? About what? Why beat around the bush? Well I... ...like you a lot. When I went home to fetch food, I didn't feel like doing my usual household chores. I kept thinking of you... And was smiling to myself Hey! I'm talking to you. What we are doing is wrong. What is wrong? The way we behave. Young man? Don't you like me? Tell me. No. Why? Why should I give you a reason for everything? Why do you pursue me once I said 'no'? Shamelessly. "If the breeze I introduce you to" "Emotionally affected by my breath true" "If my heartbeat within me" "Brow to toe scorches my body" "Looking forward with eagerness I became teary-eyed, in distress" "All that my burning heart needed was solace and comfort indeed" "Will stories as stories be?" "Will dreams remain as flights of fancy?" "Does our story of love and desire end in the flames of a funeral pyre?" Hey, Ravi, what's going on between Obu and you? What's with you? Why are you drifting away from her? I am not the right man for Obu. How strange! What do you lack? Obu is a shepherdess, and you are an educated man. That's how you see her. But in my eyes... she stands tall like our forest. The life her grandfather expects a salaried man as groom and the life Obu wants... I can't meet both their expectations. What do I have? Other than the degree I earned with the flock my father sold. Seeking a job for the past 4 years. I am back to square one as a shepherd. The same drought that hit our village has played havoc in my life too. I'm not the right man for Obu.

"In every activity you do you will find a new you" "A goal unattained" "A moment in time ordained" "This truth unspoken openly" "Life is all about trust only" "Life revolves around trust only" "Trusting your own self certainly" "Life revolves around trust only" "Trusting your own self certainly" [birds chirping and cooing] [birds squealing in terror] [birds squealing and fluttering] [herd bleating] A ferocious tiger is in this vicinity. Take the flock to the hill top. [herd bleating loudly] [men signalling the sheep] Run... for your life. [herd bleating loudly] [men signalling the sheep] [tiger growling] [Obu signalling the sheep] [tiger growling] Lead them that way. Thiripelu, come that side. Over to that side. [herd bleating loudly] [men signalling the sheep] Thiripelu, come let's hide here. [herd bleating] [tiger roars] [Obu gasps loudly] [tiger growling] [tiger growling] [tiger roars] [tiger growling] [tiger roaring] [tiger growling] [tiger roaring] [dog barking] [tiger groans] [dog groans] [dog groans] [dog squeals in pain] [tiger growls] You may go, Mr Ravi. Mr Ravi, you can leave now. Find a job as soon as possible. If you continue to be scared... One should not lose so many times, son. Obula Lord Narasimha is the groom of our house. I will graze my herd of sheep as long as I have the strength in me. Who else is there for me? E is eye contact, look at me. Well I... ...like you a lot. You cant even support yourself. How will you take care of her? His father sold half his herd. You should ram your head like how a ram fights head long. You shouldnt retreat even if your skull breaks into two. [tiger growls] [Ravi screaming] [tiger growling] You stared right into the eyes of a tiger, huh? No, sir! The tiger stared straight into my eyes. The tiger that was staring at a man ...took 2 steps back. Hunting 4 legged animals for its prey was its habit. The head of the prey bent towards the ground. And the neck behind it. The tiger aims at its neck easily. But that doesnt apply to human beings. The tiger will find it tough to target a man standing upright. But I was a confident man walking tall, in my village. When I shifted to the city, I was crawling with literally my spine on the floor. Without self confidence I stuck out my neck to unnecessary fear. But the effort I put into mountain farming for those 40 days ...built a surge of confidence within me. Forest nourished the self confidence in me. Living in drought stricken area, watching those who are the back bone to their families, I learnt how to hold on to a job. I learned how to change a desire to achieve something as an addiction. I prepared for ICS Indian Civil Service exam. [gasps in surprise] You know... Many young aspirants come to me seeking guidance for a winning formula. I tell them just a single piece of advice. Just once look at your parents who work with dedication and people in your society who set a sterling example. Nowhere else can you get better personality development coaches. You got inspired by them. And you've reached this commendable level. Great. For their own selfish needs, some people cut trees growing freely in our forest. Then, I reacted with impulse and rage. Now I want to act with authority and clarity of thought. So, I'm choosing IFS. [village percussions being played] [people whistling] My grandson has come! My beloved grandson! [village percussions being played] [people rejoicing] Welcome, Ravi! Siripelu, Thiripelu, present, sir. Why address me formally as sir? -Call me young man. -Thats right. The tiger is here! He came here as a DFO. Nallamala's son has come. A majestic tiger is here. What is this, grandson? My first salary, grandpa Keep it inside your pocket. Ah! [laughing] Look! My grandson has given me money. My own grandson has given me! Shall we go up for forest grazing again? -Sure, grandpa. -My tiger! Ah! All 2000 rupees notes! I am so proud of you, son. Thank our God and offer this coconut. Obu. Obu? How are you? I heard you are now a high ranking officer. I stepped into the forest as a normal shepherd. But now I am an officer to protect and save those forests. A job brimming with life. Obu... do you still love me? Will you marry me? The young man you met then wasnt the right man for you. Thats why hardening my heart I said I dont love you. Now I want to tell you the truth. I love you. I love you like I love the forest. I love you so much that I can achieve anything for you. Will you marry me? Tell me. Tell me, 'Okay, sir'. Sir... Okay, sir. Im a forest officer now, right? We will be living in forests and mountains. Will you be fine with it? Of course I'll be happy.
