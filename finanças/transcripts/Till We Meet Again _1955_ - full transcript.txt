NIKKATSU Presents Commemorating the first anniversary of resuming film production Till We Meet Again Original story by Yasushi Inoue Crew Produced by Takeshi Yamamoto Screenplay by Ryuzo Kikushima Cinematography by Kurataro Takamura Music by Toshiro Mayuzumi Assistant Director: Shohei Imamura Cast Yumeji Tsukioka Tatsuya Mihashi So Yamamura Rentaro Mikuni Michiyo Aratama Directed by Yuzo Kawashima I'm here to see Daisuke Kaji from Osaka. Is he expecting you? No. I was given his name by this person. My name is Jiro Sone. I'll call his room. This is the front desk. A Mr. Jiro Sone says he was sent by Mrs. Yachiyo Onuki. Who? Oh, Yachiyo's friend. Show him up. Oh, cancel my ticket for the train to Osaka. Yes, I'll be staying for a few more days. Did anything arrive from the Japan-lndia Society? Yes sir, I put it over there. Shall I bring your lunch? No, I'll be eating out. Iron my tie, would you? Please come in. I'm Jiro Sone. I'm Kaji. Sorry to bother you. Not at all. Have a seat. My daughter told me a little, but what's your research about? Sculpin. Sculpin? Ah yes, you need money to publish your thesis. Please sit. Have you known Yachiyo long? No, I met her only recently. But she said she's known you since you were students. No, I think she said that on purpose. I knew it would be an imposition. I see. I admire your honesty. No, I'm too forward. We only met by chance on a train. A train? Yes, from Omura in Kyushu to Tokyo a week ago. Where did she go? Back to second class. Oh, I see. Excuse me. Excuse me. We were in the dining car, and our bills got mixed up. You had steak with fried eggs. I had three drinks and a pork cutlet, so 300 yen is too cheap. How much did you pay? 420 yen I think, but I don't mind. Well, I do. My apologies. No, thank you. Thank you. Tickets please. I'm transferring soon. I'll be right back. Is this seat taken? No. Is something odd? No, it's just that you're so careful with your luggage. It's important. It contains my research notes on sculpin. Sculpin? The bird with the lovely song? No, it's a fish! There's such a fish? There are 74 kinds. I study their living habits. I've stared at them for so long, they don't look ugly anymore. Those are all sculpin? Aren't they cute? Tasty? Normally no. but the "pot-smasher" is delicious. Pot-smasher? They say it's so tasty. it smashes the pot. This is what it looks like. This is cottus nozawae, cottus hangiongensis, triglops scepticus, gilbertidae pustulosa, eurymen gyrinus, enophyrus diceraus, hemitripterus villosus, You drew these yourself? Icelus cataphractus, ebinania vermiculata, ereuneus grallator. The ereuneus grallator is quite an enigma. It has a split pectoral fin instead of a pelvic fin, and it's unclear whether it's an adaptation to its habitat, or a mutational evolution. We can't rush to conclusions regarding this. To be specific... That's enough. Sorry. I get carried away. I did the same with your daughter. So, you want to publish your thesis yourself? What will it cost? One million yen. One million. I came from Kyushu to Tokyo on a friend's suggestion, and visited several publishers, but they said it's of no interest to humans. I' li do my best. What? Really? Even though we've just met. It won't be my money. Pardon? I'm a businessman. I don't make wasteful investments. But I've got academic connections, so I'll try asking them. Hello? Get me President Yamazawa of Toyo Cotton. Then call Mr. Uchikawa at Nakajima Steamship. What? Oh, today's Sunday. Then call their wives at home. There'll be others too. No, that's too much. Money's not easy to come by, you know. You should try as many as possible. You know nothing about money until you have it. Er... It's only this. My meetings go by the clock. Now it's the phone. One million, right? Yes, thank you. Why do you need so much? He only gave me 7,000 yen last month. There's only you two. It's not enough. Don't be angry at me. Your tie's crooked. Don't bluff me. I'd never. It's frustrating. He's so devil-may-care. Everyone has complaints. Why not see the cherry blossoms with him? They're delightful at night. No chance. Why? Since we married, we've never gone to see them. It's true. Not in six years. I'll try calling him at work. Does he work on Sundays? Lately, he never comes home. Or he's away climbing mountains. I wish you'd say something to him. Hello? Yanagawa Trading? Onuki please. Oh, Mr. Onuki? He's at the Mountain Cabin cafe. Mountain Cabin? What's their number? Oh. Thank you. Even the cafe has a mountain theme. Hello? Oh, Mrs. Onuki. Al here. One moment. Hey, Kappei. Hey Doc, where'd he go? We need visas from the Pakistani government. Sounds difficult. We have Foreign Ministry help. Phone for you. Excuse me. Onuki here. Oh, it's you. What's up? Now? Don't be silly. I don't even have time to smoke. What's going on? Spit it out. I was about to ask you. Let's drink under the cherry blossoms tonight. No way. I don't like beer bought with your dad's money. I'm busy. Gotta go. Not before I hang up on you. He's so aloof. He's not aloof, he's busy. You say that because you had high hopes for him. Thats my fault? You courted him for half a year before you got married. I just wish you two would get along. He's a good man. That's how he looks to you. I don't look, I just bleed money. Thank you. I'll be going then. Oh. Mr. Sone was here. Yes, the sculpin scholar. He turned up this morning. Interesting fellow. Strange of him to forget this. Do you know where he is? At some environmental science lab in Okubo. Hey. Yes? Oh, Sonny! Long time no see. Been here long? About a week. Why didn't you drop by? Still with the sculpin, huh? I saw Mr. Fujikawa the other day. He's worried about you. I should have gone to see him. Come in. Professor, a visitor. Show them in. Hello. It's good to see you. I just found this at my father's office. I get so caught up, I do silly things. This is my pal Mimura. This is Mrs. Yachiyo Onuki. Pleased to meet you. Here, have a seat. Loads of documents, right? He brings his notes here after travelling all over Japan. Please. It seems dull, but it could end up refuting the theory of evolution. No it won't. Don't be modest. I'm off to see Mr. Kitamura. Bye. Hey Sonny, let's drink tonight. He calls you Sonny? Everyone did in high school, because I'm laid-back. Sonny. Sound odd? Oh, no. Letter for you. Have some tea. It's from Dr. Schultz at Stanford. That's him. He's a world expert on fish. Did he send it? No, Mr. Matsuyama in Kyoto has it, but he'll send the Taranec thesis soon. Copier working? I'll go take a look. I have to go to Kyoto to make a copy of the thesis. You're very busy. Father will also go to Osaka soon. If you'd like... Thanks. I might be going too. With your husband? Mr. Onuki wasn't on that train either. I see. Then go ahead and take your bath. My husband won't be having one. I'm home. Rika was just at the station with an umbrella. I found a small one. I picked this up too. A puppy? Isn't he cute? I don't like it. It's alive. Of course he is. He's a pure breed Spitz. Here's the pedigree. It says it has a nervous temperament. Hold him. No thanks. You're temperamental enough for me. Here boy. Sorry, I'll take him upstairs. You're sleeping with it? Good boy, Ron. Won't it wee? He might, he's alive. I hate this. You know I can't stand dogs. I'll sleep downstairs. I wish you'd stick to one hobby. You mean climbing? That's work, not a hobby. Your work costs money. What? You only gave me 7,000 yen last month. What a joke. Even if I give it all to you, it's not enough. You don't even try. You think it's not enough, taking money from home. Answer me this. Do you love the mountains or me? Well... I was born to climb mountains. You've told me that seven times. You remember? Of course I do. A wife can't bear having a rival for her husband's love. Anyway, we're not keeping the dog. We can't even afford to feed it milk on your wages. Your climbing costs money too. We can afford milk. Don't exaggerate. But I don't want it. Take it back to where you got it. Have it your way. What? Now it's the dog you love more than me. What rubbish! Do you really think so? To be honest, I really feel like crying right now. Look, do you see my tears? So the mountaineer you mentioned is your son in law. He's quite a character. Funding like this isn't easy to arrange. If it was academic in nature... Well Mr. Fujikawa, you are known more as a man of culture than finance, or mountaineering. Well, people do call me a "patron." Oh, time's up. Pardon me. See you at 5 pm. About the favor I asked... Oh, the expedition? I just asked Mr. Fujikawa, but he declined. I see. Then.. Listen, I never make wasteful investments. I know. I don't expect you to pay. I'd like some written recommendations. For whom? Some prospects. Some? How many would that be? Five notes for one million each, or ten for 500,000 yen. That's five million. Do you really need that much? I'll find half myself. We'll be making history so I'm sure they'll pay. What are the mountains called? Kara... Karakoram, in the Himalayas. No Japanese has set foot there before. Heading out? No. It'll be difficult. but I'll think of investors. Ginza 3697 please. Hello? Kaji here. It's Kyoko. I've been here for a few days. I'll pass by the store at 3 pm. I've got those earrings I promised you. Really? Yes. Alright then? Yes. Your ticket. Thanks. Leave it over there. Miss Yamana, he's arrived. Really? Look after the place for me. That man's never set foot in here. I wonder what he wants? He never asks for anything in return. He's the perfect gentleman. I admire her as well. She pays no attention to other men. Their relationship seems odd though. It might become a dangerous liaison. Urgent business? You never stay for long. I wanted to have dinner with you, but I've been invited to a wedding reception. Need money? I still have some left from last time. How's the store? We're breaking even. Glad to hear it. Where shall we go? Well, we don't have much time, so let's just ride around like this. Here... a present. I bought it for you. For me? It's a bit gaudy. Gaudy is better for a man of your age. I see. Thank you. So, where to? How about the botanical gardens? Good idea. What's this? It says "pampas grass." "Shiroganeyoshi" in Japanese. When did we last meet? February 3rd. Ah, you told me about that marriage proposal. What did you do? I declined, of course. I have other offers too. More than dressmaking ones, so it sounds. So, are you unsure of what to do? No. Why? Because, you told me that marriage was pointless. That I did, but you're free to choose. I won't get married. Well, you can do that anytime you like. Develop your career, then find someone to love. I don't think I ever will. It's so hot today. Ah, thanks. Isn't that tree huge? Yes. You still studying French? Yes. It's so difficult. You've got to keep at it. I know. Here we are. I think I'm forgetting something. I wonder what it is? The earrings? Oh, that's right. Thank you. Won't you open it? I will at 10:30pm. Why then? That's when your train leaves. I'll open it then. Is that so. Make sure you close it soon after you look. Why? I'll fall asleep as soon as I get onboard. OSAKA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE Is Mr. Kaji here? He should be at his house in Ashiya. DAISUKE KAJI Tami, take this. Mother, you shouldn't do that with your own comb. The cat's not dirty. I've nothing else to do. Give that a rest. Whatever you say. Would you like some tea? Sure. You seem more elderly than father lately. People age more quickly when they have nothing to do. Father always insists on doing everything himself. That's the way he is. He's been like that since he was young. Did he make you happy? Well... only in the sense that I knew I'd never go hungry. Men only want to treat women like pets. You'll only make Kappei mad If you say things like that. Aren't all couples that way? Mr. Sone is here to see Mr. Kaji. Oh, Sonny! Mr. Sone, welcome. You came to Osaka? I arrived two days ago. I came this morning. I see. Is Mr. Kaji in? Please come in. Excuse me. He must be busy... No, he's heating the bath. Who is? My father. It's his hobby. How is your publication going? Your father was a great help, but I had no success. Is that so. Have a seat. In that case, we've inconvenienced you. No. As your father said, money's not easy to come by. Then I'll have him introduce somewhere more certain. One moment. Father, you can't greet him dressed like that. Mr. Sone won't mind. Hello, I was just heating the bath. Thanks for your help. So you had no luck? Sorry to hear it. Let's try to find other options in Osaka. Why not stay with us? No, I must be going. I just wanted to thank you. Why don't you stay? Cancel your reservation. Yes, good idea. Stay and I'll make a few calls. How about a bath? You can freshen up. It's almost ready. I'll heat it up. He loves heating the bath. Why not take one? But I... Go on. Alright, just a quick one. Hot enough for you? Yes, it's lovely. I'm sorry you had to heat it for me. No, I do this for everyone. Even the maid. Feel free to cool it down. It's quite hot. Add some cold water. That's enough, father. Give it a rest. There's a call for you. How's your bath? Isn't it too hot? It's just right. Just like a hot spring. Gas heating would be more convenient, but father loves doing it, so we can't install it. Is your wife in Kyushu? My wife? She died five years ago. Oh my. I could only give her a poor life, but she was a good woman. I wish you could've met her. You need one million yen, right? Please, make yourself comfortable. Yes, to publish your thesis. I told Mr. Fujikawa over the phone, and he said he knew of you. The Fujikawa Securities president? That's right. Here, drink. He complimented your research, and praised you thoroughly. As you're in town, he said he'd like to see you tomorrow. To be honest, I can't meet with him. Why not? I couldn't ask more of Mr. Fujikawa. He's encouraged my research from the start, so it's enough that he understands my work. To ask him for money as well... Not many people think like that these days. Even so, he wants to see you, so why don't you go along? I know him well too. Right, mother? What's that? Please help yourself. We don't treat our guests in any special way, but they all say that's how they like it. That's what you call "flattery." Have some more beer. By the way Yachiyo, I looked for other backers for Kappei. For his expedition to the Himalayas, you know. The Himalayas? Didn't you know? No, I didn't. He always hides things from me for some reason. Everyone has their own secrets. How about you, Mr. Sone? Well, I... You should have told me earlier. Isn't that so, Yachiyo? He's too humble, this one. It'd be good to use my money. It's not from Fujikawa Securities, so it'd be my gift to society. Thank you. Is your thesis ready? Actually, I've asked for the Taranec thesis from Dr. Schultz, so that's all I need. Is that so. I could have asked my Czech friend to get it for you. I managed to obtain this rare book. Are you going back to Kyoto? I'm going to the Miyako-odori. Want to come? I have to go to Kyoto University. Oh. Shall we have dinner later then? Yachiyo, care to join us? Sure. This fellow is too devoted to his work. There are many varieties of sculpin, so studying them is a major task. If you're going to work so hard, you may as well choose a more lucrative research subject. This gori is a kind of sculpin. Isn't it, Sone? There's one called a gori but this a kind of goby. Oh, is that so. Isn't the word gori used in haiku to express summer? Sculpin are symbols of autumn. Oh right. At any rate, it has an elegant ring to it. I think the last time I saw you was at the Miyako-odori. You were still in school. Time goes by so quickly. Now why didn't I go to your wedding? We did receive a lovely gift from you. Really? But I'm not that weak-willed. My husband has a forceful personality. You seem gentler by comparison. Like an angel. An angel? You think only of other people. All I think about is my work. Perhaps when it comes to work, but outside of that... Being called an "angel" came as a surprise. But you know, I really felt that way. I hear your wife's gone home again. Is it safe to send such a beauty alone? I don't send her, she leaves. She's so selfish. You're the selfish one. You're too aloof with her. Don't be stupid. Why don't you take her climbing? She hates mountains. But... Focus on Karakoram. We need an office for our preparations. Oh, it's you Ron. Welcome. Excuse me, have you had that dog for long? No, he belongs to an acquaintance. Acquaintance? Yes, a customer named Kawabe. I knew it. You see, the dog used to be mine. My wife hates dogs, so I gave him to Kawabe. Hey Al, got any change? Er... wait right there. At first I was just babysitting him, but he's so cute I want to keep him. So you like dogs too. Yes, very much. Hey, Kappei. Got sixty yen on you? For the shoeshine? I've only got twenty. Damn. Teruko, could you give this gentleman some change? Thank you. Sorry about this. What a lovely shop. Thanks. Er, this is only fifty-five yen. Oh, I'm sorry. Here you are. Here's five yen back. Thanks for the loan. A friend of yours? Yes, we climb mountains together. He speaks 16 languages. Does Ron cry at night? Yes, a lot at first, so I let him in bed with me. Dogs are happiest with people they love. He cries when we're apart, so I carry him around in a basket. You don't say. Aren't you lucky, Ron. He's a purebred Spitz you know. I have his pedigree. I'll bring it sometime. Right, I'll be going. Goodbye. Here's my card. Hey, beer! You forgot your fountain pen. Ah, so I did. Don't drink now. Why, it's on Kappei. How come? Who cares? It's on Kappei. How come? How should I know? I'm sorry about before. I bought you a lead for Ron. How cute. Thank you. He's my responsibility too. Please take care of him. He wants to follow you. No, he wants to pee. Dogs won't if they're on a lead. I'll take him for a walk. Come on, let's go. Rika? Yes sir? You asleep? Can I help you? Where's that dog's pedigree? Your wife put it somewhere. I hope she didn't throw it away. What do you need it for? Just help me find it. Where did she put it? I'll leave you here. Look, don't come back to Osaka so much. Try to get along with Kappei. Alright. Oh, that's mine. What's that? A gift? Kappei might still be at work. Why not stop by? Yes, I will. I'll take you there. Has my husband gone home? He might still be at the cafe. I see. Thank you. Miss Yamana is out right now. Cheers. That's enough. No it's not. Hey! Mrs. Onuki! Back from Osaka? Fancy a drink? Hey! Where's my husband? He left an hour ago. He's gone to climb Mt. Kashimayari. Will he leave tonight? He's always running off. We need to prepare for Karakoram. You should scold him. Welcome. Excuse me, is there an Onuki here? If it's Kappei you want... Oh, it's the lady from the dress shop. Thanks for your help. Kappei left a while ago. This is his wife. This lady's a dress designer. I'm Kyoko Yamana. Can I help you? I came for the dog's pedigree. Pedigree... Oh, a dog's resume? I got a letter telling me to pick it up here. Oh, really? He's such a... It doesn't have to be today. I'm so sorry. I'll tell him later. Goodbye. Mrs. Onuki? Kappei said he'd be back here soon. Oh, I see. How about a drink? No, I... Come on. I can't drink. Now now. Hey, cut that out! You can't drink! Why? Because you can't. Oh right, the money I borrowed... Got sixty yen Doc? What? Wanna know how I paid for your shoeshine? How? I borrowed it from her. Really? Please sit! Sit! Sit! Sorry about that. Really, it's fine. Kappei will be back. Let's wait together. By the way, I'm Kappei's pal Misawa. I'm a surgeon. Back off Doc! I'm Al. My real name's Likura, but I like to drink, so... Call me Al for alcohol. No, one time he drank rubbing alcohol, so Kappei started calling him Al. Oh, you're back. This is for you. Thanks. I'm going to Mt. Kashimayari. Over the three-day holiday? That's why I'm going. Why didn't you say? I decided today. Not that. About the Himalayas. Oh, you knew? I know everything about you. Why do you hide things? No reason in particular. But this is serious. I knew you'd be against it. Six years together, and you don't tell me? Six with you, twenty with the mountains. How can you say that. But I climbed Mt. Tanigawadake at 15. You didn't say so before we married. Why on earth are you against me climbing? I've never been against it. But you're not for it either. No wife I know would support a husband who gave her the cold shoulder. You never think of me when you're climbing, do you? I only think about reaching the summit. That's climbing. That's what I can't stand, the egotism of it all. A wife doesn't mind what her husband does, but I want to assist you, and to be with you always. That's love. If the Himalayas are that important to you, then that's fine. I'll co-operate with you too. But when you start to climb, if you don't think of me at all, it's not fair. No, I'd feel pathetic, because I would've been abandoned by you. Don't you think so? But that's what mountaineering is like. I beg your pardon. Can you promise to send me a letter everyday? Don't be silly. No matter what you think, I'll never quit climbing. I'm taking this with me. I'll be back in three days. Darling, you forgot the pedigree. Oh, that. I'd better drop it off. I met her. Such a pretty seamstress. Right, I'm going. Hey there. Heading home? Glad I made it in time. Sorry for making you wait. Here's the pedigree. Thank you for going out of your way. Has he stopped crying? Dinner time! Teruko, don't feed him too much. You live in Aoyama, right? I'll drive. No, it's alright. It's on my way. No, I'd like to walk. I had a drink earlier. I bet it was Al's idea. You don't drink much? It was my first time. Well then, shall we walk together? I have plenty of time. But... What's wrong? I feel dizzy. Are you ill? No, the city lights look beautiful as they spin around. Will you be OK? Yes. I met your wife earlier. So I hear. That wife of mine, she said you're pretty. You'll climb the Himalayas? Yes. Misawa and Al told me you need an office. It's for packing our things and contacting people. Why don't you use my store? You can have the second floor. That'd be great, but, it'd get too noisy and disrupt your business. I don't mind. Please use it. But there'll be a huge amount of food parcels. They must be huge mountains. There's one called Hispar Kangri that's 7,400 meters high, but there are taller ones in the Karakoram Range. No-one has climbed them yet. To conquer an unclimbed mountain... how wonderful. Wonderful? Kara... Karakoram. It's hard to say. It means "black rock." Black rock? It suits you well. Black rock suits me? If you say so. Black rock. Something wrong? No. I must be going. What's the rush? Please, use my store. Driver, please turn around. Do I seem different tonight? I've had some alcohol. That's good. You should know what it's like. It's my first time being tipsy. It's so much fun. Oh, glad to hear it. You're wearing that tie. Isn't it too red? No, it suits you. So, what's this problem you called me about? Go ahead, tell me. I've... fallen in love. Let s talk in my room. So, you're in love. What's he like? He has a wife. That is a problem. You'd be wise to stay away from married men. So it's serious. I'll meet him if you like. What's he like? Tell me. It's you. Is it wrong of me to say so? Don't say such a silly thing. When I was working at that bar in Ginza, you told me you cared for me. You said you'd pay for the dress shop because you cared for me. I said that, but you've got it wrong. We don't have a romantic obligation. What do you mean? I'd never used money frivolously before, until I met you. Getting old makes you do strange things. All I want is my lost youth. I don't expect anything more from you. So... I'm just a decoration to you? To make you feel young? Oh dear. I thought you understood. I guess you could say, my love for you is like that of a father. That's why I said, marry someone you love, and I'll meet him. No! I don't understand. That's unthinkable to me. No, let's stay this way. I can't stay like this forever. That's not love to me. Listen... I'm alive. I'm a young woman. I don't want to be loved like that! Don't keep me on a shelf like an ornament! You don't feel romantically obligated to me. Is that it? My feelings don't matter. Only your own satisfaction. That's not it. I don't want to confine you. I want you to be free. Free... now I understand. You think you're liberating me, but you're binding me with the pretense of words like 'free' and 'platonic relationship.' I... I... I can't bear it! The alcohol's gone to your head. You're agitated. I'll take you home. No! I won't let you! YAMANA DRESSMAKERS Michiko, go order two servings of noodles. Two, right? That's right. Miss Yamana, this is great! It's got a phone and a great location. We'll take it. What about Kappei? He left us in the lurch, so he gets no say in the matter. But... Mr. Onuki will be back today, won't he? Misawa's a worrier, so he's wondering whether you're single or married. You'll have three men coming and going until late. It's fine. At night I go home to my apartment in Aoyama. Then we'll stay here as bodyguards for your live-in staff. Please do. Hello? Yes. This is Kyoko. How about a meal together somewhere today? Alright, I'll be by at six. I... I'll be here. Let's tell the newspapers we've set up an office. What nerve! What's the number here? Ginza 3697 Hello? Sports department? Is Take there? Takenaka? Yeah, thanks for the other day. What about Kappei? It can't be! On the north face? He couldn't have... Thanks, bye. What is it? Is Mr. Onuki alright? They said he's missing. It must be a mistake. Not Kappei, no way. But it's in the evening paper. Is it here yet? Teruko, has the paper come? Is something wrong? KAPPEI ONUKI MISSING ON MT. KASHIMAYARI? Do you think he's alright? It can't be right. It'd never happen to him. We have to tell his wife and take her to look for him. We'll go all that way just to be laughed at by him. Let's ask Take for more info. Yeah, good idea. He can be a bit careless. Hey, it's the noodles. May as well eat. Yeah, let's... Don't be so stupid! Hurry up! Bye. Good luck. Kaji here. I'm sorry, I can't make dinner tonight. Yes, let's do it tomorrow. Eh? What? I have an urgent favor to ask. Hmm. I don't know... Can you make time to meet me? Yes. Then forget about it. Well... if it's that important, I'll cancel my appointment. No, it's alright. I'll... write you a letter. Hello? Call a car for me. Miss Yamana's not here. She's not? Where'd she go? Well... she asked me to give you this. May I go upstairs? I have admired you for quite some time. After meeting you, other men couldn't compare, but then you said you don't feel romantically obligated to me. I was only an accessory to you. However, in the end, you helped me to realize that I'm in love with another man. I will go to the mountains to find him, not as a doll or an ornament, but as a woman in love. The evening newspaper says he has gone missing. I don't know if he's alive, or dead, but I will set off in search of true love. Please forgive my selfishness. Onuki... Kappei! Can you take me to Mt. Kashimayari? Sure. Is it visible from here? You can see it between those roofs. Can we go now? Oh, is the missing guy your husband? No. He's just a man I know. I'm getting in. Go ahead. Where should I go? Go to old man Ohne's place. You'll figure it out there. We'll be going now. Be careful of snow where the path's steep. Mr. Onuki of all people wouldn't get lost. Miss, he's the king of this mountain. Show her the book. This'll put you at ease. CLIMBER'S BOOK Two days, climbing the north face, strong winds. Kappei... Two days, climbing the north face, strong winds. Is that Mr. Onuki? No, he's close behind. Is he hurt? No, Mr. Onuki was the one who rescued us. The forestry patrol's report was incorrect. Why did you come? Were you worried for me? Please don't be angry at me for coming here. I'm not angry. Are you crying? No. But there are tears in your eyes. It doesn't matter. I... I love you. It doesn't matter. Oh, you're back. We've been waiting for you. Who's here? Mr. Sone. I told you about him. Sone? Ah, the sculpin scholar. We thought you'd be back earlier, so he waited for you. Did you get worried when you read about me? Of course I did. Why? Then why didn't you say so? You're one to talk. Coming home so arrogantly. At least say you're sorry! So, you're publishing your thesis. Must be a big one. It'll have volumes of general and detailed discussion, and a guide, in Japanese and English. That's a huge undertaking. I have your wife to thank. Oh, right. Here, have a drink. As if a veteran like you would get lost. There was this one time. When I was in high school, I wanted to climb every mountain in Japan. I got lost on Annupuri. I've been to a swamp near there. Mountain sculpin? Yes, the freshwater cottus nozawae. They spawn downriver. Usually they live upstream, but some head out to sea. I know mountains well, but I didn't know that. Six kinds live upstream, and the rest in the sea. There are far more of them up north, so I've spent a lot of time there. I know Hokkaido's seas well. What kinds live there? Ah, cottus... Pot-smasher. Blepsias cirrhosus, gymnocanthus detrisus. My word! You have an amazing memory. Flatter me all you want, you won't get more beer. Thank you. You're a lucky man. I've never been so well looked-after. If you say so. Come on, let's drink! You're welcome to stay. I couldn't. You can. Tell me more sculpin stories. But once I start, I have trouble stopping. Let me show you the sculpin dance... Oh, it's 11pm. Sorry to keep you up. Thank you for dinner. But it's still early. No, I'd better go. Have some tea-on-rice. I must go. Oh really? Sonny's a good man. Sonny? It's his nickname. Answer me this. Do you remember the mountains I've climbed? Why do you ask? Are you... jealous? What nonsense! Was I wrong to let him in while you were away? I'm going to bed. Wait a minute. What? Who did you go climbing with? I went alone. Really? Yes. You can't fool me. What? There was lipstick on your collar. There was? I lied. No need to worry. Idiot! As if I'd worry. You're such a bad loser. I was going to overlook it, but now I'll examine the evidence. Stop acting so vulgar. Vulgar, am I? I was nice once, but at some point I became the nasty woman you know. Aren't you going to act impudently as always? This lipstick talk is silly. There'll be no excuses once you see it. Then show me! I can't tell if you're angry or acting. Let's go upstairs and talk. It's late. We'll talk tomorrow. Feeling guilty? Rika, close the front door. Yes ma'am. Is it just a fling? Or are you in love? Open the window. It's too hot in here. I'm so chilly I could catch cold. You're so contrary. Yes, all the time... Who is she? Fine, don't tell me if you don't want to. Tonight, I want you to tell me your true feelings. I'm tired. But this is important. I want you to tell me. I'm tired. Since I married you, I've never felt loved by you. And? As for me, I think I've never loved you either. We can't go on like this. I feel sorry for you, but more than that, I pity myself. I see. Maybe I never spoke lovingly to you. But, you, I'm sure you're kinder to other women. I'm the same. I can be myself with other men. You might be right. Do you truly believe so? Yes, I do. I've never done anything about it until now. I've coasted through life, but I can't go on like this. What shall we do? I want a divorce. But I don't know if it's possible. Probably not. Because of you? No, you. Don't flatter yourself. I guess there's nothing more to say. I'm going back to Osaka for a while. What for? I'll think long and hard about whether to come back. Fine. This is the first time we've talked so civilly. Maybe so. WE NEED TO TALK. FLYING HOME TODAY, YACHIYO. Mr. Fujikawa is here. Sorry I'm late. Not at all. Oh, I received an express letter from Sone. He wants to delay publication. What for? There's a sculpin researcher in the USSR, and Sone has to take a look at his thesis, but he says it's hard to come by. There are people overseas researching sculpin? Why not publish anyway? His conscience wouldn't allow it. That's a shame. Sculpin are enough of a problem, but when it comes to humans, they're just as difficult. Welcome home. Why are you back so soon? This is my home too, you know. I'm heading out again right away. Get me my morning coat. Sure. Mother, I'll get it. Would you? You promised not to come back for a while. I couldn't help it. I had to come. Ma'am, Dr. Takahashi is here. Oh, is he? What is it, mother? An injection. I just started having them. Did something happen between you and Kappei? He found a lover. It's serious. I don't know the woman though. And? I want a divorce. You shouldn't say that so easily. Once you've said it, you can't go back on it. Even if it's Kappei's fault, you shouldn't say it. I already have. You did? What did he say? He agreed. It can't be decided so easily. But we both agree. There's nothing to stop us. Until now, I didn't want to burden you two, but I've had enough. He's a good man. How foolish. Who is? I'm saying, stop this divorce talk. Try to get along with each other. So I should fake it? That’s not what I'm saying. Tami! Yes ma'am. Oh my, it worked that quickly? Yes, your skin has regained its luster. Just two or three more. You don't say? I don't want to become like mother. You're selfish. It's your fault. Even Kappei said so. That you and mother are an odd couple. What's odd about us? It's alright for you. You have your work, but I feel sorry for mother. The way she's become... You've become busier as you've got older, enjoying your vitality and renown, but mother has no dreams. It's awful. I don't want to become like that. I don't need a lecture from you. Oh dear. Father forgot his gloves. Father, you forgot these. Look, don't do anything rash. I'm serious. You'd better be. I'm going to Tokyo soon. I'll talk to him then. Express letter. Thank you. TO DAISUKE KAJI FROM JIRO SONE You've been of great help to me. I offer my sincere appreciation. As for Mr Fujikawa's offer, I'm afraid I have to decline. I'm very sorry. I'm in Izu chasing sculpin. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Fuji well. I think I'll be here until the end of next month. Professor Sculpin! Someone's here to see you! Professor! Mrs. Onuki? I must be dreaming. I came on a whim. What a surprise. Hey, take this back for me. I heard about your publication. What a shame. There's no need to despair. I'll just keep at it. Want to take a look? I just caught it. It's a young fourspine sculpin. Adults live in rivers and have no scales, but this one does. Because it's gone from the river to the sea, it may have lost them over generations, which would overturn the current theory of mutation Al evolution. I don't understand, but it sounds very advanced. It becomes clear when you study them. Come on, let's go. Finish up for me. If my environment changed, I wonder if I would too? I had a fight with my husband. A fight? Or rather, we had a talk and decided to divorce. Divorce? You mustn't. You think we're strange, don't you. But that's what we are. Don't laugh. Sometimes we laugh when things aren't funny. That's true. Even fish laugh. They do? At any rate, you mustn't get divorced. I think you two make a fine couple. I've never met two such fine individuals. So you mustn't do it. But I can't stand the thought of going back to Tokyo. No. You have to go back to Mr. Onuki. Mr. Sone. You said I was a good wife in front of my husband. Do you remember? But to him, I'm not a good wife at all. If I found another man, I know I could be myself. Am I wrong to think so? No. But, you and Mr. Onuki.. Mr. Sone. I didn't come all this way to talk about my husband. But, I... you have to try to talk with your husband. Maybe I shouldn't have come. Mrs. Onuki. Don't do this to me. Where's Mr. Sone? He went to Tokyo on the last bus. To Tokyo? He said he'd be back the day after tomorrow. I see. Hey, be more careful with that. It's fragile you know. Watch out on those stairs. Hey Al, go to the Pakistani Embassy. No way! These guys can't be left alone. We'd work faster if you weren't here. Say what? You know the language, so you go. Aw, dammit! I've made tea. Thanks a lot. Hey, not now! Get to the embassy! Watch it! I've come to talk about your wife. We've already agreed to a divorce. But you're a good man. I'm not. Yachiyo's a good person though. You are too. We've thought about it from each other's perspective. Thanks anyway. But one fight... More than one. All we've done is fight since we got married. It sounds strange, but we've finally made peace. You're working so hard to get ready. It must cost a lot. Yes, five million yen, but it's hard to come by. We still need 1.5 million. I'm back. How'd you go? I spoke to the exchange bureau. And the packers? They said they need documents in Japanese and English. Please get Al to do it. Oh, let me introduce you. Miss Kyoko Yamana. She's the landlord. Mr. Jiro Sone. Is she your lover? Yes. Now I know what love feels like. I think Yachiyo understands. But that's not why we're divorcing. We would have done it sooner or later. It just gave us a reason. What's wrong? That'll get cold. But... is that really the case? It is. Aren't you making a mistake? No. I'm sure. Please sit down. Oh dear. Sorry, I have to be going. I forgot to pay. Sorry. One for Numazu, alright? Numazu! Numazu! Wait, make that Okubo instead. Why the hurry? It's not like you, Sonny. No more Sonny from now on. What's up? I'm sick of seeing beautiful things get hurt. You mean sculpin? Sculpin? Don't make me laugh. Back from Izu already? I've come to see my sculpin. I'm better with them than people. HISPAR KANGRI CLIMBING MAP Five days in Karachi, four or five in Gilgit, then set up base camp at the Hispar Glacier. When will you be back? Hispar Kangri means "heavenly mountain." If it's heaven, we might not come back. Don't say that! Who's captain? We need more of this first. We need another 1.5 million. Please help us out. Your boss was just here. You know he wants you to quit if you're going to the Himalayas. I intend to do so. I was born to climb mountains. When I think about conquering one that no Japanese has ever climbed, my job seems unimportant in comparison. I see. You want to go that much. Then I'll lend you the rest. You will? Don't you want it? I didn't expect you to pay. I feel responsible for how things have gone with Yachiyo. I hope this makes up for it. But there's a condition. What? Yachiyo. I want you to choose between the money and Yachiyo. I won't force you. It's your choice. I'll take the money. No compromises then? That's right. I can't lie to you. I'll tell you the truth. There's someone I love more than her. This woman... she loves you too? That's right. You won't reconsider one more time? I won't. I see. It's best that you're honest with me. Take this. Thank you. Well... I'll be going. I'll contact you before I go. Yon-e of the heavenly mountain, I fell in love with a glacier crack I'm an abominable snowman of the Himalayas, so the pretty girl I love is a fuzzball too He's very late. Even though he said he wouldn't be long. Should I call him? No, I'll do it. You're back. Sorry I'm late. I offered my resignation, but he wouldn't take it. Oh! Then... It's sad to quit a job I've done for so long, but I feel refreshed. Sounds like fun. Free tomorrow? I'll be busy from the day after that, so I won't have time then. Where should we go? Where shall we go? What do you think? Why not leave it to me then? Is it improper of me to ask you? Is it about Yachiyo? I've decided to make a clean break. A clean break? A divorce. She was unhappy because she was with me. This way, it's better... You think she'll be happier? But, if you never make someone unhappy... Swear to me you'll do it. Please swear. If you would just swear that to me, I... I... would even become a demon. Oh Kappei, you're back? Come upstairs. Well then, 3:30pm tomorrow at Shinbashi Station. You're late! And now, a speech from expedition leader Kappei Onuki. Applause! I'm not bothered about the other day. But I... how should I say this, romance is partly mutual deception. Deception? Not at all. Then call it a transaction. It's fine if neither party loses, but it seems you'll sustain the greater loss. Can you say you won't regret it if that happens? I won't regret it. You say that because you don't know him. I'd like you to meet him. There's no need. Your feelings are more important. If you really love him, that's fine. Thank you. Wait here a moment. Yachiyo. Oh, father. Did you want to see me? No, I've come for the wedding reception of a friend's sister. What's wrong? Who was that? You look ill. Something wrong? No. That woman... She's my daughter. Your daughter?! So... you.... I knew. About Kappei. SHINBASHI STATION You're late. Sorry to make you wait. I thought you mistook the time. It wasn't a mistake. I... I can't go with you. Why not? Did something happen? Oh dear. Then we won't go far. Anyway, let's get in the car. Are you crying? No. Why are you covering your face? Because I'm sad. What about? Something you can't understand. You can't understand how I feel right now. Not if you won't explain it to me. I'm a bad person. Even when we talk, something gets in the way. What is it? Someone you don't know. Is there someone else? Don't misunderstand me. There's nothing between us. He's an old man, 60 years old. What is he to you? Nothing at all. You might say I'm his dream. His dream? His dream, I think. Yes, his dream. I'm his dream. I don't get it. All in all, isn't it love you feel for him? A woman's love for a man... No, definitely not. Then what? Say it clearly. If I take your word that it's not love, then it must be obligation or gratitude. Obligation... that's not it at all. Then what is it? A dream. I was just a chaste dream of his. And so you're bound by it. I'm free. But for now, I can't move. Then you are bound... No! It might look that way, but I don't know. Dream or obligation, it doesn't matter. If you don't cut your ties with him... Yes. You're right. I want to be stronger. No, I must become stronger. But, right now... Kyoko! I don't know if I can be stronger or not, but I'll try my best. There's a chance I might fail. I might never be able to see you again. But if I feel strong, I'll see you at the airport. Goodbye. Kyoko! Mr. Onuki. Ah, Mr. Sone! Thanks for coming. Take care. Thank you. What a send-off. No, it's for a girls theater group. Sorry for this, but I have a favor to ask. What is it? Could you catch me a sculpin upstream of the Indus River? Do they live there? They might. If they do, they'll have suction cups that suit them to mountain streams. Just like in your theory of adaptation. It'd be crucial evidence, so if you do go there... Right. I might be able to go fishing at Gilgit. I'll do what I can. Thank you so much. I'll be at this address for some time. Going back to Kyushu? I'll take my documents and organize my classifications. It's not for my publication. It's time. Look after yourself. I'll be going. I'm fine here. Hey Kappei! Telegram from Daisuke Kaji. Huh? It's addressed to the three of us. "Congratulations on your adventure. Best wishes for a safe journey." "Daisuke Kaji." What a great father in-law. I'll put a stone on the summit for him with his name on it. So they didn't come. Neither your wife, nor Miss Yamana. Mr. Onuki! Good, we're in time! We got these for you. Thanks for going to the trouble. Where's Miss Yamana? Isn't she here? I wonder where she is? Well, give her my best. Dammit! In all the fuss, I lost my fountain pen. Buy one later. But... You don't need it. I've lost something far greater... You didn't go to the airport? I have no regrets about Kappei, but I can't watch his plane leave. Why not? Because it would be our final farewell. Time for my train. Will you wear this tie? No, make it this one. I got a letter from the sculpin scholar. Mr. Sone? He's returned to Kyushu and won't be back. He sent his best wishes to you too. Why not go to Osaka with me? I don't want to live like mother, doting on cats. I'll stay in Tokyo and live my own life. I see. Right, I'm going. I'm fine, you stay here. I wont be back for a while either, so you can use this room. Do something to cheer yourself up. See you. Kappei and Kyoko, Sone and Yachiyo. They all have their faults, but they possess something pure I didn't have in my youth. Because of that purity, they're all damaged, or confused. That might be for the best. Because one day, as complete people, they'll set off on another journey. THE END Subtitles by Don Brown
