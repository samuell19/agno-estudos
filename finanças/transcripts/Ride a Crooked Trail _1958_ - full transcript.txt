- Your name is? - George Blunt out of Fort Smith. Is that what them letter say? No, you know I can't read, write. Here, you look at. Never mind, that beard is three weeks old, our man is clean shave. Ride in Mr. Blunt, pay for what you drink... keep your gun in the leather and won't be no further troubles. - Hi Tom. - What this all about judge? Ah, fella by the name of Joe Maybe hit a bank in Muskogee. Didn't get nothing, but they didn't get him, claim he is heading this way. - How you know that? - Oh, We are getting real civilized. Got a wire you can talk through and you can read of what it says. Now move along Tom, you're holding up the law. Civilization, wire talking. Dismount there son. - Where you from? - Upriver. We're looking for a man from upriver. Dress like you, looks like you. Might even wear the same name. - What name you wear? - Would it make any difference? Might look pretty on the board we'll put over you. Otherwise we'll just write, here lies Joe Maybe, he tried to rob a bank in Muscogee. Relying you got the cost of all that lettering, see what he got. Slide out of the saddle, easy like. Don't try. Noonan? You are John Noonan from Indian Territory, why didn't you tell me? - Why didn't you ask me? - Are you sure about this judge? Sure I'm sure, ain't no one but Noonan wears a broken star... and no one but Noonan would shoot me for being a fool. Marshal, I owe you a drink. Follow me. Why doesn't he fall down? I've seen him shot 6 times and he never dies, less than he's drunk. Funny thing marshal, how we never got to meet. Just lucky I guess judge. I used to know Bill McLintock, him to wore the badge up in Indian Territory before you. He did? Get drunk with him a week before he got himself killed. Sam Teeler from the Pecos done it, never did meet Sam either. I heard the name. Careful when you meet him, you may lose another point of that star. I'll be careful. Confounded man, ain't more hole enough, what for you making another? Too bad it wasn't through your head. The doc here don't like me on account I never send him any patients. Let's have that jar, will you Marshal? All his trade goes to Jackson the undertaker. And I happened to know he pays you 10 dollars a head. Only if the deceased can afford it. Then should I keep them sitting or can I tell them there's no court today? There's court today, get my work clothes. Hold on marshal. You sit with me, you're my guest. Oyez, oyez. Stand up, everybody stand up. Court in session. Everybody, sit down, sit down. What we doing today? Ah, the first case is the railroad against Dan Watson. This is a railroad condemnation proceeding, won't take long. - Proceeding, be brief. - Your honor... when the company I represent... agreed to make this city the terminus of it's western division... we were sure that the necessary right-away... to the River bank could be obtained at reasonable prices. We've offered Mr. Watson 1,000 dollars for a warehouse... a portion of which we must remove for suitable clearance. His price is 20,000 and I say this is outrageous. Before you let me say what's outrageous. What you get to say Dan? Counsel Hatching will do my talking. If he does, you lose. My demand is change a venue. This court is prejudiced and admit it. You are right, it's prejudiced. On account that you are a liar and a cheater. Now if you don't like them words... take me to court. For you asking 20000 Dan? I've figured the railroad can't afford it. Oh, that's an honest statement, only ain't reasonable. I figure railroad this very important for our town. Tell you what you do Dan. You let them have what they need with the warehouse for 2000 dollars... or I'll have them build the loading platforms and wall up what's left for none. I'm not sure I can agree with that your honor. - You'll agree on account it is a law. - The law? What I say that's a law on The River, pay Dan 2000 dollars and no, nobody leave. I should've meet marshal Noonan. This man carries a proud badge... used to belong to Bill McClintock who died wearing it. Old Bill got it from Jeff Tailor who kept the law down on the Pecos. You'll be seeing the badge a lot, look out for the gun behind it. The marshal is going to keep things peaceful and quiet here in town... till I can come back to hammer. - I'm afraid I can't agree with that judge. - You'd better, it's a law. Court is adjourn and drinks is on a railroad up to midnight. I give you 10 dollars a day, cartridges and a brand new hat, that's fair enough? More than very judge, but there's a good reason why I can't accept it. Don't want to hear it. But I want you to hear it. Look, there is a town in the Kansas called Abilene... Railroad won't ever get there. Won't do enough good if it does, we're fixing to bring the trail herds in here. May you going to like this town marshal, even give you a house rent-free. - Yeah, but I'm supposed to... - Son, you talk too much. But time we get down to some serious drinking. Here, take this off, get my shirt. Where is your badge? Come on, unpin. People are going to be proud to see this badge, marshal. I think you'd be proud to show it. Two good men, both of them dead. How come your name ain't on it? Not dead. I just want tell you judge, I'm, I'm a little concerned about a new marshal. Mean you would like to be dance with all them fancy girls? You'd know I wouldn't. No, it's just that Noonan seems mighty young for US marshal. In a raw young territories don't give a chance to grow old. You made it. Because I don't put on no fancy gun show. I never give a trigger happy gunman and even break. Judge Kyle. Madigan is in town and he's drunk and nasty. So I see, I thought I've told you to keep away from him. - May be you forgot to tell him. - I told him to keep out of town. It's a good way to get yourself killed marshal. Is it? You are his girl? Madigan thinks I am. And he is coming here to prove it. Give me the shotgun. No judge, I'm ain't going let you get you self killed, not by Madigan. You stop your announces and give me that gun. - Could be he heard about your bad arm. - Still leave me a one good one. Judge, we're paying Noonan 10 dollars a day to take care of men like him. Yeah, he'd like to meet Madigan, wouldn't you marshal? Not exactly, but... I'll be here. - You've figured out draw Madigan? - If I have to. You are right, he's a mighty young, I'll put some age on him. - You come along with me son. - Buy Little Brandy a drink Ben. - A toast? - Not till I see he comes back. This one is on me, starting tomorrow you'll have to keep town peaceful. Handle work-craft. Step right over here son. - What we hiding for? - Keep shut. You'll go, he had his face on a dirt. Best time to hit him. Never give the other guy an even break. Forgot tell you, Madigan's band fights the same way. Come on. - Rest of them ought be in there. - Buy you a drink? - You've got an empty. - You've got to let. You got 10 minutes to get out of town, all of you. I didn't include you ladies, well them a drink. Throw me a bottle. Son, you ain't never going to last. What would you've done if they started shooting and you had 2 cartridges? - I guess I didn't think. - Well, I'm going to teach you to think. We are paying you to keep order, not put on fancy gun shows. This is a tough town, so only one way to keep it clean... Yeah I know, never give the other guy an even break. Please, throw me a bottle, will you? Steamboat is coming judge. Jimmy... - Where I get this? - He gave it to you. - Where I get him? - He's the new marshal. - What doing was I? - Falling down drunk. - And when I was the marshal? - About the same. - Put a gold peace in your jar. - I did. You could be the richest boy in Kansas if I keep getting drunk. - Take 20 dollars from the marshal. - He's broke. I'll pay his price, wake him up. - Who are you? - Jimmy. - Who am I? - You are drunk and you got fine 20 dollars. Jimmy is a ward of the court, he keeps house for me here. And the water space is over there, marshal. Oh, no. You better get going boy, we got a lot of work to do. Here try some of this coffee, it's great for hangover. You shouldn't get hangover, neither should you. I had this point well taken. - His dad must be a lawyer. - Jimmy has no dad. His mother used to work in River Palace, she died. And the other girls just sort of deputies? - How you know that? - It happens. Highest folks in town didn't think it's fitted, he only might learn bad in a saloon. - It could be right. - It could be. I heard the Gamefly going on judge. Eat them fresh marshal, work time. - Can I bring my gun? - Of course, what else? You like rabbit stew marshal? Jimmy is real handy with his gun, sometimes he brings in a dozen cottontails. Makes real good stew. - Judge, you sure we're in your house? - For sure I'm sure. That's I was afraid of. Being a bachelor is all the house I need, Jimmy likes it too. Now, let's separate sheeps from the goats. Sir, step right over there mister, want the boys put your luggage back aboard. I'm not going back aboard. Oh yes, you are. In can we get all the gamblers we need in town right now. And all of fancy girls we need too. Step right over there with him miss. Look mister, this is a free country, I go where I want. You are absolutely right. Only you don't stop where you want, none of them happens to be in my town. Now get on over there like good girl, go on now. Morning Mrs. Willright, morning Tom. Have you sail a nice trip above the river? Very pleasant, thank you judge. I've got something for Jimmy. Brought it all the way from Natchez and it isn't a gun. Thank you ma'am, I'll be up to get it. - Morning Mrs. Ray, morning Sam. - Good morning judge. Oh, step right over there with your friend mister. Who said so? I'm not fixed in the fights of a law. - Morning Mrs. Bilbo. - Howdy judge. Maybe. Maybe darling. Don't use my name here. - You are hurting my back. - I'll break it if you don't keep quiet. What name she called you? It's sort of a nickname judge, Tessa always calls me Baby. - I wish you wouldn't. - Why not Baby? Baby? I wouldn't take that from any woman. You would if she was your wife. She is been in New Orleans, shopping. She was suppose to meet me here and then we were going on to Abilene. Mrs. Noonan, them plans have been changed. Your husband is going to stay right here, ma'am. - He's not my... - She's a strong maiden woman judge. If she said when I going to to stay, I guess you just have to get yourself a new marshal. Could be you'll change you mind when you see the house we got for her. Judge Kyle, what's the meeting of this outrage? Do I understand these people are not permitted to land? You understand, so they, now take them back aboard. - What about the passage money? - Don't bother me with trifles captain. I got to show this lady her new house before I lose me a marshal. Hey Ben, tell Jackson to come up here with that curry, will you? - I'll take those bags sailor. - Yes sir. - What are you trying to do? - Keep alive, do you mind? - Frankly I don't care. - You will when I explain. - I'm listening. - So is the judge. Take your lady aboard marshal, I'll sit with Jackson and the luggage. You take over Ben. Here we get no bad ones on this lap. If you have any trouble Jimmy will help you. Railroad is coming right through our town ma'am. Once the track game gets here your husband going to be real busy. Hold here Jackson, this here is a bank. Got to take in there some time and have Mr. Curtis show you the vaults. And a steel door an army couldn't burst with a cannon. Anybody ever tried to bust it? Quiet a few, they are living up on boot hill. Remind me to show you the boards I've put over them. Go on Jackson. Hold right here Jackson. Hey, nobody lives in that house judge, it's blown empty. But not for a long. This is it Mrs. Noonan. - Whole yard rent free. - I really didn't expect this. You are so right. It's a real nice neighborhood. Mr. Curtis's wife live in the next house, there. A house like this is going to take a lot of furniture. Oh no, it's all there, when Mrs. Prentis died she did take nothing with her. - Following in. - Might be folks like to be alone. Aren't you tell me my matters. I'm going leave them alone. Go ahead, pick a rub. Go on, carry your bride across the threshold man. - Tessa, you are wonderful. - Now tell me if I'm bright. Somehow you got a hole at that badge and somehow they think you are marshal. And somehow I'm going to get into that bank walls without a cannon. Maybe, you are as wild as ever, tell me all about it. - We've lots of time for telling. - Stop, just about do it. Why? For the same reason I gave you in Natchez. When Sam Teeler buy my clothes I don't like another man to mash them up. - But if I buy them? - Teeler might not like that. - Would you? - I never going to know. In the house? Yeah, well I, I guess it rains a lot in this town. - Hey, we were talking about you. - We were talking about Teeler. - And the clothes he bought for you. - He paid for my trip up here too. We are in business together. I'd be very happy to take over his business. You'd be surprised how many people have tried. Well, this is more I like it. We've been through this before in Natchez, the answer is still no. But this time you are Mrs. Noonan, remember? Be smart boy Maybe, I didn't come up here to play house with you. Teeler is interesting in that bank and so am I. When I learn how this town works he'll ride in with 10 men and do what you'd like to do. - You still talking about the bank? - Nothing else. When you write to Teeler tell him I got here first. And I'm not just talking about the bank. Tessa. Try get up and bring you down here, breakfast is ready. - Come on, it's 9 o'clock. - Who gets up in the middle of the night? Good morning Paddle-Foot, where did you come from? You go with the house, eh? You hungry? Here you are. You don't feed dogs in the house, on the back porch or you love milk all over the floor? Paddle-Foot we'd might just send her back to Sam Teeler, then you and me can live comfortable. Make you the good life, when Teeler gets here it may be a short one. Well, I've got mine might surprise Teeler and you. You've been lucky so far marshal, don't push it. - What's this? - My laundry, I need it tomorrow. If we going to play house, I want a servant. Somebody to do laundry. And the cooking. And repeat everything we say to judge Kyle. No, you do the laundry. I'll teach you how to cook. Where will you learn? From that lure piece of loafer at the River Palace? I watched you last night from my window strolling in the garden. She was all over you like attend. Little Brandy? She is cute. You are not very smart. What kind of a married man are you supposed to be out on the town? You're a respectable United States marshal, remember? - So I'm laying a duty. - Duty? - It's the banker, get some cloth on. - I got some cloth on. Well, get some more. I think may be all you get in New Orleans but you supposed to be the respectable wife... of US marshal, remember? Come on. Hurry up. Oh Mr. Curtis, come in, won't you? - Good morning. - Good morning marshal. I'm sorry I'm a little late but... Oh, we understand, our honeymoon was interrupted too. I'd like you know Mrs. Curtis, lady of great patience and much understanding. How do you do ma'am? You're quiet a surprise marshal, I didn't dream you'd be so young. So young and... Well, I'll say it, handsome. This is sort of a welcome to the community basket. Just a few odds in it to make a man handy. Thank you very much, Mrs. Noonan is dressing, she'll be right down. - Dressing? - Into street clothes ma'am. You see she had the cooking and a laundry to do and she wants to freshen up a little bit. She finished with the laundry before 9 o'clock? Well marshal, you have the jewelry among women, wherever did you find her? New Orleans ma'am. - Ah, won't you sit down? - Thank you. Mrs. Prentis, the little lady who used to own this house, was rather old fashion, but I'm sure Mrs. Noonan will brighten this room up considerably. - You can make bock on that ma'am. - Make what? Oh, he means you could bet on it safely. Mrs. Curtis would like to have your wife meet some of her friends. The word is get around marshal, there's a whole slew of them waiting at the Emporium. They'll pretend to be surprised, but they had the whole deal rigged. That's not true and you know it. - Mrs. Curtis this is my wife. - How you do? And this lovely creature is already done a days washing? Should be a trend to the whole community. And the other half of the Curtis family, they want to keep locked behind bars. - Behind bars? - Mr. Curtis owns the bank. Oh, Mr. Curtis, this is a pleasure. If you don't mind I'd like to borrow your husband for an hour or two... have him meet the folks at the bank and get to see how the town works. Strange, we, we were talking about that only this morning. Mrs. Noonan, I brought you a basket. - Oh? - Just some odds-in in. - I hope you like pickles. - Oh I do, especially when it's homemade. I see you like strawberry preserves too. Well, that's the end of last year supply but you're lucky... we are putting up a new set of preserves on Saturday, it's sort of the community affair. And of course you are invited. Now I learned if Mrs. Watkins really knows how to put up creole peaches in brandy. - You are creole? - Yes, French. From New Orleans, shall we go? Excuse me one moment please. Marshal. Your badge. Morning Jimmy. - How's the judge? - All over. - Go ahead, ask him. - Yeah, you know him so good, ask him. - Ask me what? - These kids want to touch your badge. - Touch my badge? - I told you might accept it. Go ahead Shorty, you're first. Is there where the bullet hit? The one that killed marshal McLintock? Yeah, that's where it hit. Hurry up, the marshal is busy. Alright, you've touched this, give me what you promised. Jimmy, when you get back from college look me up to the bank, I've got a job for you. If he stays with judge Kyle much longer he will never get to college. - Oh, the judge is alright. - Not as a father. Jimmy needs a home, don't you agree Mrs. Noonan? - Well, I don't know much about Jimmy. - Well, I guess you don't. He's a wonderful young kid but he lives down on a shanty boat with judge Kyle... and though I have nothing but good to say about the judge... his manners as to say the least are rather peculiar. And the boy needs parents. Now if it were only you and the marshal... Come to think of it, you have an extra room in your house. I'll put the next one right between your eyes. I've an order that says this work is to start immediately and you're in contempt of court. I've got a lot of contempt for you too, now get out or get killed. Mr. Stark, I advise you let judge Kyle handle it. - Mr. Watson is a dangerous man. - Why not let the marshal handle? - I was a judge you'd be dead. - You ain't a judge, stay still... If you ain't gotten on the way I could've blasted him. You are a lucky man marshal. I've seen Dan kill bigger men than you. Oh well, they were taller. Now look, get along with your work here now, we're waiting on that railroad. I can understand now marshal, why your wife has so much confidence in you. Well, she won't have for long. You ain't never going to last son. I'm sure Mrs. Noonan isn't interesting in bank. I've her meet some friends of mine in the Emporium and you show the marshal around. - Oh, but I am interested. - Only in the combination to the box. I don't think you want to turn her loose in there. Oh, these men annoy joking. I wonder what they'd do if someone actually did robe the bank? Yes and I wonder. Alright, alright. Hold the music now. Judge is getting ready to speak. Any time, your honor. Ladies and gentlemen... this is a great day on The River and not so long ago this place was just the prairie. And we built a dock. And we've been listening to that whistle ever since. River Queen brought us a lot of business... and it also brought us a lot of disreputable citizens. I bought me a shotgun and things set alarmed me. But they were still around the town and one day a man come riding down the river road. With him he brung a broken star. And the River Queen brung the marshal's lady. And the whole town bust in a bloom, like flowers in the spring. Now, we got another whistle, on account of we brung in the railroad. Could be it'll bring a lot more disreputable citizens... but we ain't worry, not while marshal Noonan is here to greet them. Now, we'll have a few words from the marshal and then we'll drive to Golden Spike... and everybody can retire for a drink, it's hot. Ladies and gentlemen... I'm not very good with words but... from where I'm stand I can see wealth and prosperity coming to this town real quick. And maybe a little trouble... But I guess if you want one you got to take the other. They always seem to go hand in hand, thank you. So you wrote your letter. Now Mr. Curtis will drive a Golden Spike... and everybody will please move that-away toward the tracks. - See who rode in? - Yeah, I saw them. Know who they are? - I've seen them some place before. - I haven't but I don't like their looks. I'll have a talk with them. Maybe... - May be I better go along with you? - You have Mr. Curtis driving the spike. I'll do my own talking. Wouldn't you like to walk with us Mrs. Noonan? Ah, thank you, but I better wait for my husband. You kids, get lost. We got company Teeler. Pour the marshal a drink. Drink it. First ones on me Teeler. Tess says you are good with a gun. Claims you killed John Noonan. - He knows better now. - You are wearing his badge. - Only till I empty that bank. - Which you ain't going to do. Have a drink. You ain't going to empty it, that's why I'm here among other things. Tess wrote me you've been playing house. - I don't like that. - And I don't like him. You get a drank waiting. You know how the bank works? I know how works. Suppose I get real brought minded and forget about you and Tess. - It's nothing to forget. - Knowing Tess I'll buy that. As the railroad payroll sit in that bank, it'll began tomorrow and so are we. We don't have any trouble, I'll get you in for a slice. We don't need him Teeler, we don't want him. - I'm going along with that. - Any of you know how to get into that vault? - That'll be your job. - Not for a lousy railroad payroll. The trail herds will be coming in soon. That's big money, my kind of money. Ride in when I send for you, get rich quick. That sounds reasonable. - And interesting. - Not for me. I never did trust to a man that hide behind the star... and I'm ain't going to start now. Call him Teeler. Now get out of town. I've still got 9 men, you get 5 shots. You don't count good mister. I've got 500 shots in this thing and I'm ready to start spreading. I told them they can leave. - I heard you but it don't make no sense. - May be not but I'm the law. Get out. You get a deal, send for me. - I don't understand you son. - I'm sure you don't. Next time I'll write. - I still think Pecos was right. - That's why he's dead. No, I mean about the bank. We should've brought that railroad payroll with us. - The others agree with me. - Who else agree with Dirgen? Say, who thinks some I'm wrong? Me, I rode a long way to that bank and I don't like to ride back with no money. Yeah, that's the way I feel about it too. We can get awful hungry waiting for Maybe just sign us to work. And I'll by chuck of that. In a couple of weeks these hills are going to be cover with beef. Every one of those cows is going to be worth money. Before they ship east they have to be paid for with money. A lot of money. We may need pack mules to carry it after we empty the bank. - Is enough worth waiting for? - Ain't no law against hitting a bank twice. Look, I got a woman down River. She's an expensive woman, and I'm going back empty. I've got me a woman right here in the town. I don't want to go away, but I'm going. Not with me, you ain't. We don't need Maybe, we'll make the hit in a morning when they open the bank. Anybody riding my way? - It's been a lovely evening Mrs. Noonan. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night marshal. - Good night. I had it. Your husband is so brave Mrs. Noonan. I think he's wonderful. - I think he stink. - Thank you. Would you like another cup of tea Mrs. Noonan? No, I want a drink of whiskey. We're having a church session next week, wouldn't you like to come? No, I want to go to the River Palace and dance, I want to laugh, sing and yell. - How you do carry on Mrs. Noonan? - I'm going to get off here right now. - Any particular reason? - Lots of reasons. Is Teeler one of them? I'm tired of this masquerade, I don't like this town and I don't like you. - But you do like Teeler. - Why don't you leave me alone? - He's coming back, you know. - When? When I send for him. We'll empty the bank and we'll all live town together. - How soon will that be? - As soon as the trail herds come in. You won't last that long. I saw the judge today watching you. Like a cat watching a mouse, he knows something. Are you worried about me? I'm still wearing Teeler's clothes. You need a change. I decided to come and live with you. - When did you decide that? - Today, at the saloon. - When did you get here? - A while ago. Hope you won't mind, I fixed supper for me and for him. - You heard us come in? - I heard you. - What else did you hear? - I got homework to do. - It's late, you'd better get to bed. - Where do I sleep? I'll show you Jim. - Can I take him too? - Sure, why not? Alright, hit it. I don't have to say my prayers? So the judge was making me say them. Then I guess you'd better. Bless Shorty, Red, Bucktooth, Bless the judge and Maybe... may be everything will be alright. Bless Little Brandy, marshal and Mrs. Noonan, amen. - I brought you some milk and cookies. - Thank you. - It's a nice room, I think you'll like it. - I like it. - Well, good night. - Good night. How much do you suppose he heard? I don't know but I'll worry about it tomorrow. - Not in here. - Where for instance? There's a nice stiff couch downstairs, why don't you try it? Now look, what if Jimmy gets up first? That be kind of hard to explain. You've got lots more than that to explain. It's in there, Jimmy. Get up on a porch, you can't come with me. I'm late for a school. - What are you doing in there? - Oh, I'm not taking a bath. But if you'd like too I'll be glad to scrub your back for you. Mighty pretty back too. You could've slept at the sofa and you know it. Yeah, there's a lot of places I could've slept. Get out, suppose Jimmy should come in and find you here. Scrubbing my wife's back? It's an old family custom. Marshal, they come back, they are come back. They're robbing the bank. - They're what? - They're robbing the bank. My bank? They are robbing my bank? So Teeler made a deal, but he didn't keep it. You stay home, I'll tell you what happen. Give me that shotgun. Who's next? - Real quiet, ain't it? - Yeah, real quiet. - Where is Sam Teeler? - I wouldn't know. But you should, you let him ride out yesterday with these renegades. What make so sure? I though you told me you've never seen Teeler? Well, I haven't till last night, then I went through the files and I found his picture. Underneath it was written, wanted for murder. - I've never seen that picture. - That's funny. I've found it in your office right on top of the pile. You get pay 10 dollars a day to look. I just say I made a mistake. If you did you certainly corrected it this morning, let me thank you for saving my bank. - I feel kind of like is my bank too. - Well, that's real nice of you. Yeah, real nice but if you would've put Teeler in this modern jail... yesterday there wouldn't be no fight this morning. - And Teeler wouldn't be on the loose. - I got the feeling he'll be coming back. - Thanks a lot. - For what? Letting me know about the bank. May I speak with you marshal? Alone. I lose more men that way. Why didn't you nail love that Kate? You should move your office into the River Palace. You've been here every night for the last week. I, sure, the bathes are too much softer here. Tonight you can use Jimmy's bed, he's gone. When did he leave? When neither of you came home for supper, I went to his room... and things are gone, so is the puppy. Marshal, aren't you heading the wrong way? Could be. What's the matter Mrs. Noonan? Can't you train your husband? No, but I'm good at training cats, especially alley cats. - Didn't you like our home Jimmy? - You're sort of crowded. You had your own room, real nice room. Yeah, real nice, maybe that was wrong. I knew so nice homes, I was born in a saloon. Funny thing, I knew a fellow once, he was born in a saloon too. His mother was one of girls that worked there. - Her name was May. - May what? I wouldn't know, she died very young. I guess girls sort adopted this fellow? - That's right. - Did he have a name? No, not really. Girls so called him May's boy. Some way along the away it got shorten to Maybe. He needed a flat name, so, called himself Joe Maybe. Them women in town, they wouldn't let him live in saloon anymore. Is that how it was? This was different kind of a town. Nobody cared much about kids, not those kinds of kids. Didn't care if they learn anything or not. - You can learn things in a saloon. - Like what? Slim Jack the gambler, he was teaching me to deal seconds. Promised teach me a fast draw when my hands got bigger. This fellow Maybe, where did he learn fast draw? In a saloon. Like you say, folk could learn lot of things in a saloon. Joe Maybe... learned how to steal gold dust from drunken miners. Pretty soon he learned how to rob a bank. Too bad there wasn't a fellow like judge Kyle around him, tell him he was wrong. Yeah, too bad. What happened to this Joe Maybe? He met a nice girl, another fellow's girl. He met some nice people. Got himself follow mix up in time. Like trying to be someone who you ain't? - It's about it. - It's getting rather late. Tessa will be worry about us. You'll getting a broken back sleeping in that bathtub. - Jimmy, why ain't you in school? - I'm not care of it Saturday. - Is the judge in? - Yeah, he is in. But you know he don't like dogs in his courtroom. - But this is my dog. - Well, I guess that makes a difference then. Jimmy? - Preparation for a killing? - Sure of. What about your shoulder? It's fair, pulls low when I draw so I wearing little lower. You'll be enjoying this killing? Not exactly. And nobody in his right mind enjoys a killing. - It's worse when is someone you like. - You wouldn't do a thing like that judge. You take Padlefoot over there, suppose he got rabies. You wouldn't want to kill him, you wouldn't like to kill him, but you'd have to. What's the rabies? When he's sick and crazy in his head, bites everything he sees. And everything he bites dies. He isn't crazy at head and he isn't going to kill anybody unless he has to. May be you are wrong about this killing. Suppose Padlefoot comes home one day Jimmy... in his mouth he has got a piece of a dogs collar... maybe the collar has a name on it, and the one who wore it, he never shows up again. Would be reasonable to assume that Padlefoot did the killing. He did not, I swear didn't. May be he is mixed up a little inside, but he isn't crazy. Could be he's just bad, that happens to man or a dog. Gets born wrong, raises wrong, everything he learns is bad. So he lives bad. - Suppose he tries to change. - This kind never changes Jimmy. I guess you are right. If you born in a saloon you are bad. Everybody says you are bad, so there is nothing else to do. I didn't mean that, you know I didn't mean that. Judge, the trail herds are coming. - Where are they now? - Now right over the ridge, heading for town. What for you're staying around? Is a trail herds coming into town. Court is adjourned. This is a great day marshal, this is going to make our city the gateway to the West. Yes, it will. Let us hope that those who'll pass through will do it quiet. Especially the trail drivers. I wouldn't worry about that reverend, I've met a lot of them, they're nice people. I've been looking all over for you, where you've been? Fisting with the judge? Ain't you sit that saddle? Mr. Peter down the saddle shop made it special for you. Where did you steal the horse? It's a present from Tessa. How do you like to ride out and help bring the trail herds in? Would I. You stay here Padlefoot, I'll be right back. Oh boy, a new rifle boot too. Sure, man can't be riding now without his gun. Besides, you might get some practice. It's a big drive Jimmy, looks like they got them here in good shape too. - Could we top those folks riding point? - Sure, why not? Hi you, marshal. I'm Sam Mason, trail boss. Brought a few thousands heads of from Texas, can you handle them? Yeah, if you don't crowd us. Take a few hundreds into town, you'll find the holding fence within the track. Leave the other down the grass and feed them slow. Good enough, say hello to Teeler and the boys while I pass the orders. Son, you ride under the trail boss, I'll pick you up later. - We decided to ride into the herds. - You made a lot of decisions. Some of them are not too smart. You mean about the bank? Dirgen and the rest, they wanted to make a hit, I was against it. When I make a deal, I keep it. - Is that why you are here? - What else? You said was going to take a lot of money to pay for that beef... and we here to help you collect it. You know Yuma and Clovis? No, I don't know them. But do they know I'm boss? - Sure marshal, we understand everything. - We'll do just as you say, Maybe. You'll do just as I say and you'll forget the maybe. Stand back till I roll them. Move on and hold them. What happened? What happened to Jimmy? He had a fall. He'll be alright, get some whiskey. Whiskey? I didn't mean disturb them, I didn't mean to. Don't worry about it son, everything is going to be alright. It's is my fault, I let him rope the lead steer and he jogged to saddle off. I don't care how or why, he is hurt. There was nobody is fault but mine, I'm alright. Takes more than a little falling to make a man like you down. - What are you doing? - I'm doctoring. Doctoring him? You go and get the doctor, I'll watch over him. No doctor, I'm going to get up. You going to do exactly what I tell you to do, both of you. Now we're going to get all the bruises cleaned up. Can't you make him go away? I mean if you go with him. - Don't you like us? - You better than that. Then why you want us to go away? The judge will get him, He's been watching, waiting him now. - He's sure he killed Noonan. - He didn't kill Noonan, Joe was been chase, They came to the rim of the canyon and... You stay here, anybody comes let me know. You stay right there. - Surprised? - Yes. Maybe didn't say anything about sending for you. He didn't? - Where is that kid Maybe brought in here? - Why? He saw me riding with the herd. I wouldn't want him to tell a gun-happy judge. He won't. If you say it, I'll buy it. You and Maybe have a nice family set up here, kid and all... but it's all over now. - You messing my dress. - I'll buy you a new one. I'll buy you dozen of dresses with a diamond brooch to wear in each one. As soon as we hit the bank I'm going to make you the best dress woman in New Orleans. - When does this happen? - Tonight. - Have you talked to Maybe about it? - Why he bother? I don't need him. Clovis and Yuma have knock open better vault than that, all they need 2-3 hours. See to it that we're not interrupted. There are some things I want to tell you. Things that ain't been working out the way they should. Why not? The bank is full of money and we're here to get it. This is ain't the time, Judge Kyle is suspicious, he watches every move Joe makes. If anything happens to bank tonight, he know the answer. Only half the answer. - He doesn't know that I'm in town. - He knows Joe Maybe is in town. Lucky judge is get some of the blast of that shotgun. Is that was you planning to do? I figure they'll get Maybe killed, if that what you mean. Now listen fast, I want you to keep the judge and Maybe busy at night. - Keep them away from the bank, understand? - I understand. As soon as Maybe hears the bomb blow he'll ask questions. Tell him that I took to river road and that I'll meet him in Natches. And if I do? We'll ride over the cattle trail, there' be no signs. That's Yuma, somebody is coming. How do I get out here? There's a gate in the backyard. It lead to the River Palace. You are real handy, see you in New Orleans. Well Mrs. Noonan, let's have a look at that boy of yours. He's upstairs. Are you sure you won't have another piece of strawberry cake? Mam, I ate most of that cake right down the plate. Perhaps, I could do with a little more brandy though? Why, of course. Or with some coffee ma'am, I'll take care of the brandy. - What about you marshal? - No thanks judge. I'm getting a little sleepy. Oh, I'm sorry dear, it's an old creole custom. - Getting sleepy? - Sitting late at the table. Why, in New Orleans we sometime sit down to dinner at seven... and don't leave the table until midnight. Oh, we passed that record hours ago. - Ma'am, I just got to get some sleep. - Oh shame on you, the evening is just begun. Not for me honey. - I want to go to bed. - And I want to dance. We haven't had a real party since we've been marry... and this a wonderful evening for dancing. Won't you dance with me judge? Well, I may try a few steps if we get someone to whistle a tune. - I can't dance without music. - There is music at the River Palace. It keeps me awake most of the nights while my husband is on duty. Ma'am, nice ladies don't dance at the River Palace. Oh yes they do, if they wearing a pretty new dress and want everyone to see it. Do you like it? Well, I noticed it. When did you get it? Today. On account is pay day and I'll give you wages. Take a quick look judge, I wear the pants in this family. She wears dresses and she better looks in new one. Come on, lets show up you pretties. Let's go the back way, it's closer. Judge, you sure back to find house for newly married men. Sometime we don't get to sleep to 4 o'clock in the morning. And you are complaining? Haven't you been in that bathroom marshal? You know the too sides of this trickiness town and your wife doesn't belong to this one, Or does she? And may the same thing goes to you too? I have a lot people asking. - Have you? - What do you want marshal? Oh, just say I walk at the middle of this street, shall we dance? He's a pretty girl for you judge, not very bright, but very pretty. This is my night, remember? And I'm wearing a new dress. One you bought for me. Quite all right if you mess it. And if I tell you that Teeler was in town. - He wants to hit the bank. - What you want to do? - What do you want me to do? - Dance with me. - All night? - Almost all night. - And when I see Teeler? - You not going to see him. Neither am I, but if the Queen is leaving in the morning for New Orleans... we'll be aboard when she leaves. - What happens to the bank? - Does it matter? Matters to him. And a lot of nice people who think we're nice. How long can it last? The judge knows who you are, he is waiting only for the chance to kill you. Let's get out while we can. It's just one of the trail drivers, celebrating. With a cannon? Did you hear what I've heard? Sounded like dynamite. I'll look around. The bank, they rob the bank judge. - You and your pretty new dress. - Turn around. Judge, he didn't know. You was with him all night, he didn't know about it. You're supposed to be fast with that gun, make your play. Funny thing, I thought you never gave the other guy an even break. And I was right. - Teeler took the cattle trail. - Thanks again Jimmy. - Seen him son? - I've seen him. Took to river road way, ain't he? Took my horse too. Is a private fight judge? Not, no more, get Milder and our sworn in deputies while we ride. You heard what he said, let's go. - Ah, can't figure who shot off that light. - Could've be one of Teeler's men. Far away from a bank? Act smart and we can make a deal. What kind of a deal? I'm caring what we took in the bank, ride with me and we'll split down the middle. - We are riding back to the town. - Much is alike to tell a judge about you. - You'll get your chances. - You want stunned them running? You ever been in a middle of the stunned beef? You better make up your mind before they catch up with us. It's made up. I shouldn't might to let you go ma'am. Please, await till the judge says it's alright. She didn't do anything. He's right Jimmy, let's not argue about it, if that's the way has to be, well... I won't get far. I'll get busy on a telegraph, every town on a river will be waiting for him. Thanks for your help boys. - If you'd asked me I could've told you. - Told me what? That he didn't take to river road. You let me hang on the judge, I'll teach you aboard the River Queen. Mrs. Noonan now wants to get down the river. She ain't Mrs. Noonan and you know it. Yeah, I know, I know a lot of things, so do you. She ain't done nothing wrong judge. She tells a lie, what right you've got posing as a decent woman? No right at all. Whatever Teeler took from the bank you'll find in those bags. He got a few things he'd like to tell you about me. Maybe he don't have to tell me. That's what I've thought... What else do you think? That Tessa and I will be moving alone. - Goodbye Jimmy. - Turn around. You ain't going away, lift them. Lift them. Star is a rough dirt, mind as well keep it. But if you scratch a name on it, be sure to write Joe Maybe. Good thing I didn't give you a shotgun. - Ever sleep in a bathtub? - What? You better marry then. You be in my chamber at nine o'clock, that's the law.
