Flame bursts from the tail of the rocket. The rocket launches with sound speed. So fast. Then the rocket hit the asteroids. The rocket keeps moving to Mars. My dream is to become an Astronaut. Do you know why? You must have watched star wars, recently. My dream is to build combat vehicles like this panzer. I want to become like Mr. Habibie and also be able to build my own plane like this. I adore my aunty. She is an expert on insects. Over the years, my aunt built flower gardens to be habitat for rare butterflies. My grandpa often told me stories about space. That’s because he works at Bosscha. Bosscha? Bosscha is the largest observatory in Southeast Asia. It is in Lembang. Well, that place is the center of space observatory in Indonesia. It was built during Dutch era. Well, this is Bosscha observatory. The place where my grandpa works. So, why do you want to be an Astronaut, Aqila? I want to ride a rocket and see all the objects in the space. I wonder how it looks like in the space out there. Who knows if I will meet an alien. That's alien! Long time ago, before the 18th century. People once believed. That the earth was the center of the universe. Where the sky and the stars. The planets, the moon, the sun. All revolved around the earth. The only way to prove that the earth revolves around the sun was.. Swinging pendulum. In the 6th century Prophet Muhammad had received many revelations. About earth rotation. One of those was explained in Surah Ali Imran verse 190-191. Allah said.. In translation Verily, In the creation of the heavens and the earth. And the alteration of the night and the day. There are signs indeed for ones endowed with intellects. Well, The alteration of the day and the night. It is another way of saying the earth is rotating. So, through this verse I conclude. All kinds of knowledge. In the universe. There are signs in Al-Quran. Now it is our job as human. To discover in and to explore. Limitless knowledge. Mrs. Dinar, what’s going on? Well, concerning Aqila. I apologize. It looks like Aqila is not making any progress in learning to read Al-Quran. Actually, Aqila is very smart. But you know. Almost every time I came here. Aqila was busy with her gadget. With other books. And she even fell asleep. So, what’s next? Kids, This is our universe. There is the Sun as the center of our solar system. And there are also planets that revolve around it. Each planet has its own track. So they won’t collide around one another. Does anyone know what planets are there in our solar system? Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. Excuse me, Mrs. According to the latest discovery, Pluto is not a planet anymore. In science book, Pluto is a planet. I know this information from the internet. Calm down.. I won’t say which one is right or wrong. But, I want you to find the answer. On holiday, I will give you an assignment. Calm down.. You have to make a report on the newest discovery of natural science. Mrs, my aunty works for butterflies captivity in Lampung. She once told me. That she found a butterfly species that had been declared extinct. So, can I make a report on that? Very well. Reni, I can't wait to read your report. Mrs, regarding Pluto, I will go to Bosscha. And observe directly from the main observatory’s telescope. Observing the nature is a valuable experience, Aqila. Good luck, okay? OK, you’re all free to use your creativity during the holiday. Have fun! Oh yes, yes. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Prof. You are Thomas, right? Yes, that's right. Starting from tonight, I'll start my internship at the Zeiss telescope. Hopefully, everything goes well. Why, Prof? Because, for the past year.. There has been distractions and light pollution out there. Especially when there is concert. Their lights are directly pointed to the sky. So, that is distracting. Totally distracting. So, how about that, Prof? Seems like tonight won't be cloudy. Hopefully, the observation will go well tonight. Very well. Very well then, Prof. Thank you very much, Prof. You're welcome. Tika. How’s your pregnancy, honey? Still having nausea? I’m feeling a bit better, mom. Don't get too exhausted. If you have another miscarriage, I would be sad. It’s time for Aqila to have a sibling. How is Aqila doing? Today, her Quran teacher came here. She told me that Aqila lacks of focus when it comes to learning to reading Al-Quran. So? Do you have any plans? Well, I’ll give her something to do at home. Impossible. That kid is very active. You’re right, but what else can I do? Actually, I already have a plan. How about.. On this holiday, Aqila stays here? So that her Grandpa will be excited too. There is a mosque that usually happens to organize Pesantren Kilat for children. It's good. That sounds good. But I can’t take her there. No problem. Let me take care of it. Okay? Okay, mom. Thank you, mom. Okay then. Assalamualaikum. Waalaikum salam, mom. Thank you Mr. Tirno. Mom.. Mom.. Yes? Mom.. Hi.. What's going on, honey? What's going on? You're so excited.. Mom, today I got a very important report assignment. Mrs. Mona gave me an assignment, mom. On new discovery in the nature. So? What will you write about? Mom, my friends are not yet aware that Pluto is not a planet. It’s a new discovery, mom. Mom, can I.. Hmm.. Can I? Can I stay at Grandpa’s this holiday? So, you want to ask him about Pluto? Mom, that's not fun. How about.. What if, on this holiday, I’ll be staying there. And then. I will be joining to observe Pluto through the main telescope at Bosscha. Then, I can make a report on that for my natural science assignment, mom. I bet my report will be cool, mom. Then I'll record that during the observation. That must be fun, what do you think? I also just talked to Grandma earlier. What did she say? She said no.. No excuse for not visiting her this holiday. Yay! Mrs. Subur, the chicken in the fridge is for soup. Okay? Aqila loves that so much Very well, Mrs. Very well. I'm leaving now to take some money. Okay? I'm leaving that to you, okay? Assalamualaikum. Waalaikum salam. Alhamdulillah. Masha Allah. Grandma! My granddaughter, so beautiful. Ya Allah, Ya Rab. Are you fine, honey? I'm fine, Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. This is Ros. This is Aqila, you didn't forget right? Now shake your hand. Ros will be your friend while you're here, okay? Let's go inside now. Masha Allah, you are taller than me now. Unbelievable! Grandpa will be surprised to see you this tall. Masha Allah. I have prepared. A room for you. This is your room. Grandma, let me take a look. Let's go. Accompany her, please. The air is so fresh here. Do you know what it is made of? It’s made of paper. My dad made it. Ros, is this balanced now? A little down. Keep going. What is that? This is glow in the dark sticker. Here it is. Your telescope is cool. Wanna have a look? Try this. Then iron sheet. Brick. That's all? Fix that part. That right part also. Excuse me, sir. May I help you? Does this hotel already have the permit? Not that I know of. I’m only a worker here. This land belongs to the state. It is located near to the Bosscha observatory. I’m only a worker here. Thank you, sir. Wait. Wait a minute. Assalamualaikum. Waalaikum salam. Prof, we’re in danger. My speculation was right. What's going on? We just passed the west side of Bosscha. Last night, in the bright area. That hotel is going to be build back. But I’m sure they don’t have the permit. I hope so. And we have to confirm again to local government in regards to the permit of that hotel. Because if that hotel is established there. Bosscha will cease. What do you mean? Come with me. For the past 5 years.. We’ve been trying to retain the lights around here. By using our own lamp caps. These caps will be given for local residents for free. Does it work? Yes, pretty much around here. But, it will all go in vain. If there is a hotel building to be established later. And too close to the observatory. A building that has strong lighting. And directly pointed to the sky. Because the night sky will become too bright. And human’s eyes are not possible to see the stars. Even through gigantic telescope. In this position. The stars still can be seen. If this telescope is moved a little to the west. There will be the stars that we can’t see. It must be because of that building’s lights, Prof. Tomorrow, I’ll meet the person in charge. And I will discuss about the next steps we should take. Assalamualaikum. Waalaikum salam. So happy. Grandpa, why did you come home late? Yes, even the one coming from Jakarta arrived here earlier. She has eaten many kinds. How was the trip? It was a bit stuck. Hold on. Let me change my clothes first, okay? Hurry up, Grandpa! Okay, okay. Grandpa, a few months ago, I browsed on the internet at school. There was a striking news. Is it true that Pluto is not a planet? Is that true? Right, Pluto has its own path. It’s different from the other planets. Grandpa, did you know? In my natural science book. It was written that Pluto is a planet at my school. Really? Yes, there was even someone from my class who was stubborn about that. Coincidentally.. My teacher, Mrs. Mona. Gave me an assignment on new discoveries in the nature. What does that mean? Hmmm.. Grandpa. Is it okay if I take a look at Pluto using the main telescope at Bosscha? Let me ask you a question first. Aqila, are you able to read Al-Quran now? Hmmm. Last time I heard from your mom.. She said you can’t read Al-Quran yet? Grandpa, I’m still learning. Let's do this way. You can use the gigantic telescope. Inside the dome building. On one condition. You must be able to read Al-Quran. Grandpa. But you know I never break my promises. Once you read Al-Quran well. I’ll take you to take a look at Pluto. If you're sleepy, stop driving. There, your dad is going home. Dad. Honey. Are you leaving? Yes, I'm off now okay? Take care. Mom. Destiny is in the hands of God. But you have to take care of your baby in the womb. Tell Tika. No more bending and lifting heavy things. Tika is difficult to talk about that. Alright, I will tell her. Sweetie, be nice here and to Grandpa and Grandma. Okay? Drive safe, son. I'm off now, Assalamualaikum. Walaikum salam Warrahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. Earlier, Thomas passed through the street where the streetlights were recently installed. And it turns out, it is true that the hotel will be built. Ya Allah. How come? That land belongs to the state. How did they get the permit? What can't be done here? What is forbidden can be allowed. As long as there is money. What a mess! Well, if it's true That the hotel will be rebuilt, It's over. Bosscha will be powerless! Ya Allah. Because it is impossible to conduct night observation if the sky is too bright. Impossible! If that happens, What am I doing here? If I can't work here anymore, What am I doing? Pa, Don't think too far like that. If we think about it, Why are people nowadays getting less interested in science? Why? Hello, Aqila! Are you in Bosscha already? Yes, I am in Bosscha already. I am also in Lampung. I'm at my aunt’s house. Tomorrow, I'm going to the butterfly captivity. That sounds fun. Have you been able to observe? Not yet. I just arrived here. Eh, let's wrap it up. Bye. Oh my granddaughter is still awake. What's wrong? Ouch, Grandma. It's worrying. My holiday assignment. What's so worrying? Grandma, did you know? Grandpa said, that I can only use the giant telescope, if I am able to read Al-Qur’an. That’s good. So you will get two things. You get to use the telescope. Able to read Al-Quran as well. It will be done together. Hmm but I’m lagging behind my friends. Ya Allah, my granddaughter. So stressing out. You're on vacation. Masha Allah. You wanna be like your Grandpa so bad. Allah Kareem. Actually, I want to discuss about the rule in this house. Is there any rules here? Yes, there is. It’s only one though. Every Subuh, I will wake you up. Then we will have Subuh prayer together. Your mom never told you? Tell about what? Ya Allah. Since a long time ago, I woke her up in the morning. Always. That's why your mom always got the highest grades. Why did it have anything to do with Subuh prayer? My granddaughter, you don’t know yet, do you? Masha Allah. If you wake up early in the morning, for Subuh prayer, your brain is still fresh. You can study, or you can read Al-Quran. That is why your mom said that even though it was only an hour The school lessons were easier for her to learn. Oh, that’s why. So now, let’s get some sleep, it's late already. So you can wake up for Subuh prayer. Okay? Sleep now. Aqila, do you know? Grandpa loves reading Al-Quran. Do you want me to recite the verse from Quran that he loves the most? So you can be like him. Now close your eyes. (Reciting Al-Quran) Aqila, wake up my dear. Alhamdulillah. (Subuh prayer) Assalamualaikum Warrahmatullah. Assalamualaikum Warrahmatullah. Yes, Tik? Oh, no. I’m glad. I’m not bothered. (Aqila) Ros, where are you going? I’m going to Masjid. There is Brother Andy in Masjid. Brother Andy? Uh-oh, the storyteller who created Mio. Mio? Mio? Mio the black and white cat, isn’t it? Yes, Aqila. Brother Andy is invited to come for the opening of Pesantren (Islamic boarding school). Ros will be joining too. Yes, of course. Just go to the Masjid instead of staying home. Aqila, I’ll introduce you to my friends. Hmm okay. Assalamualaikum Warrahmatullahi Wabarakatu. Waalaikum salam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatu. Masha Allah. Alhamdulillah, we are all able together here today. And as promised, for the opening of this holiday Pesantren. We will be listening to storytelling by who? Brother Andy. That is right. Let’s give him a round of applause. Brother Andy, the floor is yours. Thank you, Sister Raudha. Kids, you wanna listen to a story? Yes! (Storytelling) Fauzi, stop it! Boy, go away! What a naughty boy you are! (Postman) Are you okay? I'm okay. Now go away! You are so naughty. Hurry up! Thank you sir. Assalamualaikum. Waalaikum salam. Grandma. Oh honey. Aqila. Grandpa, why are you still at home? I’m an astronomer. An astronomer is like a bat. At night, I leave the house. Grandpa, hold on. I wanna show you something. Alright, alright. Grandpa, I think it’s broken. When I tried observing the moon, I couldn't do it. Let me take a look. Maybe because it was shaken in the car, on the way here. So? I’ll bring it to my office. My staff is good at fixing telescopes. Grandpa, can I come with you? What for? Maybe I can take a look at the giant telescope first. If you want something, you never give up. But first, I still want you to be able to read Al-Qur’an. I’m leaving now. Okay my dear? Prof, this is the draft of letter that I wrote. Let me read it. With respect. Through this letter. We, as the management of Bosscha observatory, would like to request you, To examine the permit of construction of a hotel that is built 200 meters from Bosscha observatory. Please also write The star observatory that we have been conducting so far, Has only been successful, If there is no light pollution. Light, sir? Yes, light. The light around Bosscha. Grandma, what are you making? Hmm what am I making? Maybe it’s my clothes. Try it on. Exactly today, it’s finished. Alhamdulillah. But, I think it’s more suitable for you Aqila. For me? Wow, so good. Thank you, Grandma! I didn’t only make one. I made three. For my beautiful granddaughter. Look at this. These is the new model. Suitable isn't it? Thank you, Grandma! Tomorrow, you’re going to Pesantren right? Now, try these clothes on. Yes, let me try. Okay? Yes, all of these. Haha you're dead! Don't you dare to go against Bang Codet! You kept talking, that’s why I wasn’t concentrating. Do you know the story behind this? Please tell us. When I was in Sumatera, Hiding in rubberwood, Preparing to rob a truck, Which was carrying coal. But suddenly, There was a voice. When I turned my body around. A tiger lurking? That's right! A tiger lurking! The tiger was so big! 2 meters! But I wasn’t scared. I got myself in fighting position right away. Then I pulled, Parang (knife) from your sarong! Right! And then, wrestling with the tiger. Then I blocked. Eh, I missed it too. But, I made a counter right away. I took the knife. Then I stabbed that tiger’s chest. Until, It was dead. That's it! That's the story. CODET! CODET! Yes, mom? You keep telling the same story everyday! They even remember the story. COME HERE! Yes, mom. Hold a second, mom. The water in the tank ran out. Yes, mom. The chicken coop is very stinky too. Clean it up first! Mom. Yes? What? Please don’t yell mom I’m embarrassed if you keep yelling. Let's do this way. I’ll clean the water tank now. But the chicken coop is for tomorrow okay? Tomorrow? Yes. That is what your answer is everytime I ask you to do something. Tomorrow again, tomorrow again. Tomorrow again, tomorrow again. So lame! You know, Codet. You’re supposed to give an example for your son. Look at your mom. For years, I became a single parent for you! Everything I did was for you. Babysitting neighbor’s kid. Making kerupuk (cracker). As long as it’s halal. Everything was for you! Yes, mom. I know. Even many men proposed to you, right? That is right. And those who proposed to me were important people, Codet. Even one of them was a minister. Ya Allah, Mrs. Subur, it’s so messy here. Mrs. Subur? Ya, Allah. Astagfirullah. I’m taking off now, dad. Okay, go ahead. Assalamualaikum. Waalaikum salam. Boss, only 20 grand? But it exploded, boss. It exploded. Not enough? Of course. Hi, everybody. This is Nayla. Waalaikum salam. Kids, do you know what book this is? Al-Quran reading diary! That is right. Now, I wanna ask you a question. Which Iqro book are you learning? You? I just finished book 6. I’ll start reading Al-Quran soon. Wow. I'm in book 4. Great! I’m reading Al-Quran. Wow. What about you, Aqila? I’m in book 5, sis. That is good. So, I will pass this Quran reading diary to all of you. Everytime you come for Pesantren, please don’t forget to bring it. Because each of you will learn to read Al-Quran with me. Got it? Yes, sis. I’ll tell you a story. So, there was a 5 year old kid, Who’s able to read Al-Quran beautifully and mesmerized many people, At the end of Istiqlal festival. Subhanallah. So inspiring, right? Later, when you want to know the profile. I’ve got the article, we’ll read about that together later, okay? So, now... Aqila, What are you doing? Cool, outer space game. Can I borrow it? Is it about outer space game? Speaking of outer space, it reminds me somethig. I’ve got an info about a comet. There is an amateur astronaut from Australia, his name is Terry Lovejoy. He said that there was a comet that passed the earth 11,500 yeas ago. Can you imagine how long it was? How incredible! And interestingly, comet that’s named Lovejoy will pass Indonesia next week and we can see that directly Can we really see that directly? Yes, we can. Insha Allah. If the sky is clear and not cloudy. Hmm, it gives me an idea. How about, we go camping next week? So we can wait for Lovejoy comet to pass at night. And the next morning we can walk around the farm? Are you guys in? Yes! Excuse me, sir. What is this? This is Lovejoy comet. It will pass Indonesia soon. This is rare phenomenon, sir Only occurs once in 11,500 year. What do you have in mind? So, we will have exclusive coverage of this Lovejoy phenomenon directly from Bosscha Observatory, And Bosscha Observatory will conduct the observatory and invite people. Later on, that issue will be covered right away on our front page. Okay, do it. Okay, will do! Good bye, see you tomorrow. Anyway, sis. Can I ask you a question? What is it? / Should we write this as well at home? If you read at home, it’s just for practice. This one, this is for me to sign, showing that you’ve already got guidance from me. So it’s for Pesantren only. Got it? Yes, sis. If you have another question, just ask me okay? OK, good bye sis! Assalamualaikum. / Waalaikum salam. Hold on, Aqila. What is this? (Screams) (Laugh) Gotcha! Who are you? Ha, who are you? I’m Grandpa Wibowo’s granddaughter. Grandpa Wibowo’s granddaughter? Scary. Break it up kids, why are you fighting? You’re not supposed to fight, but get to know each other first. Fauzi, this is Aqila. She came far from Jakarta. Only to attend this Pesantren. So please don’t tease them, OK? And Aqila, no need to be angry. Fauzi is your neighbor. He lives near this masjid. Okay now, you all go home, okay? It’s too late already. I'm afraid your family might be looking for you. We're leaving now, sis. Fauzi, don’t be naughty. OK? Have you observed Pluto? Hmm, not yet. The preparation to use that telescope is so long. Oh, I thought you’ve done it. Anyways, the caterpillar I mentioned earlier has turned into butterfly! Now, I’ll just have to make the report. Oh, really? That must be so fun. Yes, I can’t wait to be back to school! I will show what I have learned this far on holiday. Obviously, Mrs. Mona will be glad to hear. Reni, let’s eat. Eh, let’s call it a night. I have to go eating now. Bye. OK, good bye. Codet, did you do what I said? Consider it done, boss. The first step, it is done. Well done, well done. And you will get 10 times more, If you can run Professor Wibowo and his family out of Bosscha. What?! Run them out? Why? Professor Wibowo is... Enough! You don't need to know. Wait for my instruction. But... Hello? Codet, come here! Help your mom out! Yes, mom. Codet! In the evening you’re walking around. After Maghreb you’re supposed to read Qur’an while waiting for Isha prayer. Instead of walking, around! Do home chores a bit, sweep the floor, or whatever. How can you be a good example for your son if you are a mess like this. Did you know? Your mom is.. I know mom. High school graduate? Able to speak English? Beautiful, sexy. Many guys proposed? One of them became a minister? There! That is right. Who is it all for, Codet? For you! For you too, Fauzi. I’m from Palembang, grew up in Medan. Lucky for me, I can make kerupuk (cracker). The money is pretty good, right? For our lives. How many have you got? Pretty much. That is great! My granddaughter, where is your smile? I don’t know. I’m thinking of my holiday assignment. Don’t think about that, just do it. How can I do it? I’m not allowed to observe the Pluto! Earlier, Reni has sent me a picture of rare butterfly. She took it herself in Lampung. Meanwhile, I haven’t done anything! But taking a picture of butterfly is easier than observing Pluto, isn't it? Hmm that’s right. How about.. You’re going to see the comet, right? So when you see the comet, you take a photo of that. Add it to your assignment. That’s better, right? Dear, I have a research project from ITB. Assalamualaikum. Grandpa, Grandpa. Grandpa, can I come with you? Qila, you can not come with me. Tonight I already promised to a student who has research assignment from ITB. Anyways, I am still waiting for your promise to me. That's again. It's been days since I've been here and I still can't see the Pluto. What’s the relationship with between reading Al-Quran and observing Pluto? Are your students able to read the Quran? Come here.. come here, honey. Sit here. Qila, think about it. During Rasulullah’s time, before clocks were invented. Allah had commanded Umat Rasulullah to pray 5 times a day. At that time, how could people know when to pray when there were no clocks? So, read. People have to be able to read the sun so they can pray in due time. To determine Ramadhan month, we have to be able to see the Hilal (crescent). The point is Allah has implied that we have to observe the sky. Or read science in the sky or the earth. Ultimately, I believe science can’t be separated from Al-Quran. Now, let me ask you a question. Do you know the first verse that was revealed by Allah? Surah Al Alaq 1-5. Alhamdulillah, that is correct. The first word is Iqro. It means read! Read Allah’s verses that were revealed in the Quran. Secondly, read Allah’s revelations in the nature. Learning Astronomy is Iqro too. Like you and I do. Thirdly, the last one, is to read Allah’s verses within ourselves. While understanding what we are. Can you imagine, when you’re able to read Al-Quran. I will take you to see the sky. Behind the dark sky, there are many colours. And light that you never imagined before. So beautiful. Magnificently beautiful. Assalamualaikum. Waalaikum salam. Aqila, you’re heading home yet? No, sis. I don’t understand this part yet, can you teach me? Of course. Let’s do it. Let me help you. I think this part is still difficult, Sis. In Iqro 5, your challenge is to be more attentive, okay? You will see more words combination. Alif-lams here are lot, but you don’t need to read. Let’s try. Wannahar, That is correct. Let's continue. Wannasu. It’s usually read ‘wal’ but you got it right. Keep going. (Reading Al-Qur'an) Did I pass? Yes! Now I can read Al-Quran. Aqila, I have a present for you. Congratulations, now you have finished the Iqro book. You can read the Quran. Thank you very much, Professor. You’re welcome. I’d like to say thank you as well. I’m glad there is media that covers a story on Bosscha. That rarely happens. Thank you, I’m glad to be here. You’re welcome. By the way Prof, Until now, whenever I want to know information about astronomy I always go to NASA’s website on internet. Does Bosscha release any news around space? Last year, we had an activity to create photos of outer space. But this year, I have to be honest with you. That our activity is a bit distracted. If I may know, why is that Prof? So, there used to be a constellation that we could observe from here. But after '95, we can’t see it anymore. You may know why. Obviously, the light pollution causes it. So, it is that serious, Prof? Very serious, very serious. Hurry, hurry. Where is Grandpa? Where is Grandpa? Yes, yes. Let’s go, I am afraid it will rain. Are you ready? Yes! What’s wrong? There was someone who made this tire flat on purpose. Really? Is that true? You might have forgotten to inflate the tire? It’s flat, you see. Ya Allah, Astagfirullah. It never happened before. Why don’t we try calling Bang Codet? Kids, wait inside for a second, OK? Assalamualaikum Bang Codet, can you come over to my house now? For the past week, I’ve been disturbed by someone. Now, I got my tire flat. Come right here! Who is he? Mr. Wibowo. Did he know? I think he did not know yet. Because he wanted me to come to his house. His tire car was deflated. I want to be honest with him. I want to tell the truth if we terrorized him. Mr. Wibowo is kind with me. Also with the people. I can’t do this anymore. Don’t do that, I am afraid he will mad at us and tell the police. We will be in danger. Boss, we will go to the jail again if we do that. Have you been into the jail before? Yeah, just yesterday. You stole the chicken, didn't you? No, I stole the bananas. That’s very cheap. How do you feel kids? Are you happy? We are happy. Alhamdulillah. Right now, I want to tell you that next week there is a festival around here. In that festival, there will be moslem kids competitions. One of them is reading Al-Qur’an competition. I want to ask you, who will go into the competition? Me. Raise your hand higher. Me. Astagfirullahaladzim. Kids, are you alright? Please be quiet here. I will check it first. Astagfirullah. Fauzi, what are you doing? There is someone. Whom? Fauzi, don’t be noisy. Don’t you know? The kids were reading Al-Qur’an inside. You are really noisy. Sst.. Chill out kids. By a chance, you are here, Fauzi. I am gonna tell you something. I just told your friends that there will be an Iqro Festival next week. There is a reading Al-Qur’an competition. Why don't you compete there? Do you want it? No, I don't. How can you participate? You never read Al-Qur’an. Zi, are you sure that you will not participate? If you want me to participate, then I will participate. That’s great. Kids, let’s go inside. Prof. Wibowo and the others, we are from International Astronomy Organization. Periodically, we observe this Bosscha. Within last three months, it has been changing drastically. Talking about the luminance in Lembang, Bosscha was being neither effective nor productive. Moreover, there will be development of new hotel in Bosscha. Is there any decision from the center, sir? Until now, the decision still in the progress. If this condition still happen. We are as fundraisers will consider whether the fund would be stopped or not. When World War 2 happened, Japan wanted to demolish this Bosscha. But Allah still decided to protect the Bosscha. The bomb could not explode. I was thinking that Bosscha should stand still for the sake of education in Indonesia. But look right now, we could not strong enough to defense it. After this announcement, I will end this recitation. Assalamualaikum Wr. Wb. Walaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. Bye, we're gonna leave now. Wassalamualaikum. Waalaikumsalam Ros, why do I only have one shoe? Where is it? Ros, help me please. Ros that’s my shoe! Get my shoe! Why me? I saw it myself, your shoe was flown by a bird. If you’re brave, don’t attack me from behind. Come to me face-to-face. Oh, really? So scary. But I’m sorry, I can’t fight with a girl. Okay, we’re gonna compete in Al-Quran reading competition. You dare? You are scared, aren't you? No, I'm not. That’s great. I'm looking forward to seeing you compete there. If I win, you have to apologize to me and my friends for your misbehavior. Okay but if I win, you have to buy all of my crackers. Okay, I'm not scared. Let’s go, Ros. That festival? Yes grandma, there will be competitions for moslem kids. There will be calligraphy, coloring, and Al-Quran reading competition. Then? I'll compete in Al-Quran reading competition. Al-Quran reading competition? Grandma, Grandpa, you must come. I want to prove that I am able to read Al-Quran. That would be great. Grandpa, you didn't forget your promise right? Of course. Please finish your dinner. Dad. Yes? In 2 days, I will compete in Al-Quran reading competition. If you have time, you can come. What else, Codet? I think I can't do this anymore. You don't have enough nerve. What did he do to you? Not really sir. I am afraid to get caught. Yesterday, he told me to come to his house Because his car tire was deflated. I was really afraid to get caught. You are a fake gangster. Okay, we will do it professionally. If you fail to follow my order, you will pay for it. Good evening, sir. I am Sidiq from Pikiran Rakyat, do you have time for interview? Sure. Sir, as far as I know, you are the best player in property business. As covered in many media, you’ve been developing mega projects. If I may know, where are they, Sir? I've been developing a real estate project in Pekan Baru area. In West Java, I chose Lembang. Because Lembang has great tourism prospect in the future. I have to build a luxurious international hotel there. So it will be built in Lembang area. Where is the specific place? Bosscha. Around Bosscha. Bosscha is a conservation area, isn’t it? How about the land permit and the others? Sorry, I have other things to do. I still have one more question, Sir. Sir. (announcement) This competition is not only intended for the prize. More importantly, it's a reminder for us, That Al-Qur’an is really important to be learnt from childhood. Before we start, let’s say Basmallah together. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Oh you are here. How are you? I’m fine. Masha Allah, you look different today. That's good. I want to see Fauzi. Competing? Yes. I’m sorry, sir. I could not find the man caused you terrors. Don't think about it. Alhamdulillah. Recently, there is no terror anymore. Actually, we were worried about you. So you come alone? Where is your mother? She did not come? She did not come. She is too old. Got stiff. Where are you going? We are going inside. I think the competition will be held in inside, not here. Inside? Coming with us? Yes, yes. (Al-Quran recitation) I'm sorry. (Al-Quran recitation) Look, he is my grandson, Fauzi. (Al-Quran recitation) Where is he? (Al-Quran recitation) Yes, he is my grandson. (Al-Quran recitation) Fauzi is so great. (Al-Quran recitation) (Al-Quran recitation) (Al-Quran recitation) Alright, ladies and gentlemen and kids. Now we will announce the winner of Al-Qur'an reading competition. Honestly, the judges were so surprised. Because the winner is able to recite just like Qori and Qoriah in Indonesia. Seems like he was reading Al-Quran from his hearth. I even shed my tears when he was reading Al-Qur'an. Let’s announce the winner. Ahmad Fauzi. Congratulations. / Alhamdulillah, sir. Congratulations. Fauzi, your recital was very good. Oh, thank you. Actually, I got into this competition was not for the prize. But, I couldn't refuse Sister Raudah's request. I’m sorry, I underestimated you. I thought you could not read Al-Qur'an. No problem. I thank Sister Raudah because she taught me patiently. I want Sister Raudah to take the trophy. But... But because my father took it first. Maybe he wants to display it at home. Hooray, there are crackers. There are crackers here, come here. Please make a line. So that's true? You bought all Fauzi’s crackers? Before I leave, I want one. Okay? Oh, I forgot to tell you. I listened when you were reading Al-Qur'an and it was good. No, not that good. Compared to Fauzi. You should not say that. It was no surprise if Fauzi won the recitation competition. He has been learning with me for one year. I know you also can. If you know Fauzi briefly, he is quite a prankster. Everybody knows him. Playing with catapult, playing with insects. I know all of that. But until one day... When his mother passed away. I never saw him like that. He got gloomy and distanced himself. At one time, I spent my spare time to teach at the mosque. I invited kids to recite every afternoon. I began asking Fauzi to learn reading Al-Qur'an. He could learn to read Al-Quran quickly. Slowly but sure, he could read even memorize it. And as you listened before, He can read Allah's verses beautifully like a melody. Qila, Fauzi once said that reading Al-Quran Has become the cure for him when he is sad after her mother passing. So to Fauzi, reading Al-Quran is not only for prize. But also very important for his life. It is official now. Mom, where is Qila? She is still sleeping, honey. I will wake her up in a bit. No, just let me do it. Aqila. Hey. It’s already Subuh, honey. Grandpa. Yes. Hmm, Qila. I want to apologize, honey. For what? I can't keep my promise to you, Qila. To take you to see Pluto with through the giant telescope. Because.. Bosscha has no use anymore, dear. Why? The space can only be seen if the sky is really dark. But the problem is that someone is building a hotel with bright lights near Bosscha. Look Aqila! Those star and moon stickers are visible. But if this lamp is turned on, let’s take a look. See, those stars cannot be seen anymore. The sky light cannot be seen anymore. Because the sky light is less brighter than the light from the Earth. Bosscha can't be used anymore. I’m sorry, you have been working so hard to be able to read the Al-Quran. No, Grandpa. You don’t have to apologize. I never regret learning to read Al-Quran. Reading Al-Qur’an is not for reward. Now I read Al-Quran only because I want to. But. But what? I am sad if Bosscha is closed. How about you, Grandpa? I will be okay, honey. Having granddaughter like you is everything to me. Let’s pray now, honey. There is a book I forgot to bring. I will take it tomorrow. My hearth is so heavy. When I'm looking at you this sad. We have been living here for so long in Bosscha. Right? There are many books that you wrote while you're here. Not to mention, your research results domestic and broad. They're all your big contribution to science. I've witnessed that you have dedicated your life for science. Just leave it to Allah now. Those who leave it to Allah, He will give us a way out. Insha Allah. Allah will show us ways, even unexpectedly. And He will ease your ways for all of your concerns. I am sorry. I came here to apologize. And also to confess. I caused you terrors. I appreciate your honesty. But how could you do that? Hmm, how can I say? I feel so bad. My life is not peaceful now. Initially, the hotel boss promised me to give people jobs. As long as the hotel development run well. But when I thought about it again. If the development run well. Then we might lack of water. Because the hotel will take so much water. And Bosscha will have to close as well. How come? The bright lights from the hotel will distract the sky observation forever. I’m really sorry. It is OK, Bang Codet. Even though you didn't do anything to me, that hotel would have been built. If we take a look at the hotel developer, they already have a strong back up. Bang Codet, what do you do now? Just like usual, sir. I protect the security of this village. Not so much. Actually selling Palembang cracker is quite good, right? I will look for a funding from Baitul Mal. So that your business with your mother will grow. I hope it will be the best way out for your life. Thank you very much, sir. You are welcome. Good afternoon, sir Good afternoon. I am from the post office, sir. There is a letter for Mr. Wibowo. Oh that’s me. So coincidence. Please put your name and signature, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Now let me explain how it works, honey. Aqila, come see this. Take a peek from this position. Right here, Grandpa? / Well, it doesn't appear yet, honey. No, it is not right. Hold on. Wait a minute. Once the lights are off, you can see it from there. Ready? / Yes. Ready to see Pluto? I'm ready. Thomas, please turn off the lights. Are you ready? I’m ready. Go. Bismillah. Turn the mirror. It is good, isn’t it? Like this, Grandpa? Look! At this video it can be seen that Pluto has different track. So, Pluto is more similar to asteroid than a planet. Pluto is one of the discovery cases that may change in the future. So, the researcher will never stop to conduct a research. That's correct, Aqila. Maybe, under the sea, there is a species that hasn't been discovered yet. Or maybe, there is a plant which can be a cure for a disease. Or maybe, an extinct butterfly that may be still living in this world. Speaking of butterfly, I just remember something. Because of Reni's assignment. Take a look, this is a butterfly. (Clapping)
