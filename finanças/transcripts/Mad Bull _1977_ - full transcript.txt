Keep me away from him or I'll break his jaw. All right, all right, cool it! ♪♪ Papa. [speaking Greek][speaking Greek] Iago? No, thanks. Okay. Like that, just like that, your mother used to bring it to me when we were young in the old country. I think when she died, we all lost very much. You maybe the most. You were her first born, her favorite. Yeah, Papa. Yeah, Papa? She wanted you to have what we came to America for. Pop, I got a big Cadillac outside. She wouldn't like the way you got it. Why? Because youdon't like the way you got it. [sighs] What's wrong with what I do, Papa? I don't steal. I don't rob. You stand up when you're told. You lie down when you're told. This is why we left the old country. You'd rather have me win the gold medal like you wanted to do, huh? Maybe. Well, how long can I eat the gold? Not too long. So what do you want me to do? Not to stand up and not to lie down when you're told. You don't understand, Papa. If I do that, I'm done, I'm through. Maybe you'd be just beginning. I'm going to beat a man... faster than me and in better shape. How? Pop. Pop, hold it, babe. [speaking Greek] Time out. Hold it. What is it? [panting] How many miles, Pop? Four. That's one more than yesterday. That's enough, huh?You're hurting? Yeah, I'm hurting, Pop. One more. Oh, no, wait a minute. Pop. Uhh! All right, that's enough. That's not enough.

I am talking with Jack Braden, the White Knight, the defending world champion. Tell me, Jack, and tell our fans, have you done any special preparation, any special training for this coming championship bout? With all respect, Walker. I don't need any special training to defend my crown against anybody at any time. Well, now, you may have heard Mad Bull has gone into hiding. But rumor has it, rumor has it that he's secretly training hard and may have a few tricks up his sleeve. What do you think? Well, that's wonderful, Walker, but he's gonna need more than tricks or sticks or name-calling to beat me. I have all these wonderful people here. Isn't this fantastic? It's certainly is, Jack. And I want to thank you. Thank you, Jack Braden. You are always the gentleman. Well, thank you, Walker. Well, ladies and gentlemen, there you have it. There you have it from Jack Braden, the White Knight, who is spitting in the face of Mad Bull, the challenger. So be here one week from now.

You call here one more time, so help me, I'll-- Iago? Iago, is that you? Christina? Are you all right? Yeah. How are you? I'm back in Redlands. I was working late tonight, and I was reading this interview with Jack Braden. I was wondering how you were. I'm all right. How's Anthony? No change. No better, no worse. I called the hospital a few times, but, um, I couldn't get through to him. Yeah, well, he's on a lot of heavy medication, pain killers, mostly. What a shame. Uh, Chris, uh... the match is only five days away. Oh, really? I lost count. Well, I just thought if you were, you know, near L.A.-- Oh, uh, who knows? My boss and I are supposed to take a trip pretty soon, but, uh... I don't know where. Well, it's kind of important. Christina? Well, uh, anyway, good luck. Yeah. Thanks. Uh, bye, Iago. [hangs up receiver] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, I have a few announcements to make just before the main event, and while they're lowering the cage, I bring to your attention that Hat Pin Hattie is at ringside just in case one of the wrestlers leaves the ring unannounced. [murmuring] [all talking] Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Could you spare a quarter? You talking to me? No, I... I guess not. Then you must be talking to the wind, huh? No. I guess-- I guess so. You do a lot of guessing, don't you! You bum, you! You always obey the law, huh? Do you or don't you? [mumbles] Yes. I'm undercover. Oh. That's what I wanna hear. You keep it up. I understand. [chatting] [announcer] Your attention, ladies and gentlemen. Besides the sell-out crowd here tonight, we also have millions waiting to see this event on television throughout this great country. I wanna see that windbag and his college degree carried out on a stretcher. Hey, there is no law that says you've got to fight him clean, Mad Bull. Bust him. Yeah, and afterwards, we'll celebrate at the Body Slam Bar, and the drinks are on me. Hey, what do you know? Old Yapo's gonna reach into his pocket for a change instead of his brain. You listen, hayseed.[laughing] Hey, Iago, how you gonna fight him? I'm gonna wrestle him. Hey, that's a hot one! All right, let's get out of here. Wish him luck, boys. We're pulling for you, Iago. You know we're in your corner, baby. I'm gonna keep an eye out for that goofball that took a shot at Anthony, so don't worry, man. Good luck. Hiya, champ. I'll tell you one thing, Duke. I ain't carrying that man to make him look good, you hear me? Hey, all I hear is the cash register, do you hear me? Now, that crowd, they paid their dues, so do what you want. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Uptight, Iago? No. Want a rubdown? [sighs] No, thanks, Sweep. I'm gonna tell you something about Braden. Don't get him mad. If you do, you're liable to wind up a pretzel without salt. Thanks. Got a lot of heart. Go to it. They're looking for you, Sweeper. Hey, why ain't you dressed? Where's your getup? Since when did you care what I wore? Okay, okay, but let's go. The main thing's the match, huh? Hey, Creech, do me a favor, will you, baby? Huh? Tell Braden to go in first. Oh, come on. You can't do that. It's all backwards. Tell him, baby. [audience clapping] [announcer talking, indistinct] [clapping continues] Who does that animal think he is? The challenger always enters the ring first. I'm the champion! I'll see what I can do. You do that! [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been advised that there will be a slight delay. What the hell do you think you're doing laying back here? Braden's blowing his cork. Braden blew his cool? Right through the roof. What did you think he'd do? Well, why didn't you tell me so, man? Let's go. You know something? You're not as dumb as you look. I think you got the smarts for a "bull." Thanks. [crowd murmuring] [crowd] We want action! We want action! We want action!

Now, fans, here's the rules. In order to win, the wrestler must first score a fall before climbing up over the cage. The first man scoring a fall, up over the cage standing erect on the apron outside of the ring, he will be declared the Heavyweight Wrestling Champion of the World. Your referee for this all-important title bout, former Champion of the World, Count Billy Varga. [cheering] You know the rules. Bear in mind, this bout's for the World Championship. I want a good, clean wrestling match. No biting, no gouging, and no hair-pulling. And remember, the first man on the ring apron is the winner. Shake hands and go to your corner.

Come on, Dad, get him! [crowd booing] [announcer] The Mad Bull drops Braden to the mat with a step-over-toe-hold. That's for Anthony, you understand that? Uhh! [booing] They're fighting for real. I thought so too, but I thought I was crazy. [announcer] The Mad Bull drop-toe-holds the White Knight. [booing] Okay, Braden. Iago's fighting him for real. He's gonna get killed. Uhh! I'm gonna break your arm, just like your brother's. [yelling] [announcer] The White Knight has an arm strike on the Mad Bull. One... All right, Dad! Come on! Come on. [crowd booing] [shouting] [cheering] He's using a salt capsule. [booing] [booing] A curious thing is happening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm watching a champion fight dirty, and a challenger fight clean. [booing] [cheering] [cheering] One, two, three! Don't tell me Mad Bull's going straight. Right. I know you're right. I'm his father. Uhh! [crowd booing] [shouting] Hey, Braden, break it up. Break it up. He needs you there. [booing] Uhh! [booing] One, two, three! I'm the winner! [booing, shouting] I'm the winner! Winner! I'm the winner! Winner! I'm the winner! [booing] I'm the winner! I'm the winner! [crowd booing] I cannot believe what I'm seeing. They wrestle animals in a cage like that, and that's exactly the way that Jack Braden is acting, like a caged animal. [cheering] [mouthing] Come on. All right. Come on, Dad, get him. Get him. Come on, Dad, get up. Alex. We have been over this before. I forbid you to watch this nonsense. But, Mom, it's dad. He's fighting to be champ. [turns TV off] [turns TV on]He's my father.
