Slow down. You go through here to fast you'll sank the other boats. You don't have to use the wheel now, just the gauges. Easy, this way, Very good, very good. - Hello Francois. - Look they get you got the big one. Easy, easy now. Easy. Very good, very good. That's it, that's it. Watch that boat in front. Hear Yankee, will see you tonight? Oh I don't know, I might have some work to do. - You owe us a revenge. - Revenge or a lesson, eh? Herr Langsdorf, you know you could make a first class pilot. You see what he thinks. Papi... Oh, hear captain, will you come for a drink with us, now? Well, you see, sailors never drinks. Well, they don't when they're working, sometimes. Mathias, give Jean Paul a hand with that, will you? - Try to put in the back of his car. - Is that all? - Same time tomorrow? - Same time. - Bon jour Mr. Martin. - Bon jour. - I was worried, you're later than usual. - Yeah, what's new? Several people calling about the prices. A booking for Saturday, 5 Americans send by the concierge of the Negresco. Send the concierge a commission, what else? Your wife, wanted to know if you're in for dinner. Oh, call her back, tell her I have another engagement. Say, it's a big deal. - No, no, no, no. - Yeah, yeah, you gentleman made the rules. For three times in a week you taken to defeat us. - Wait till next time, worst. - We said eleven o'clock, right? But rules... - There just there to be broken. - You know, that's how war start. Oh, I give you another chance, We'll divide the money in half, flip a coin. Tails, you split it, heads, I keep it all, Ok? - You want a change? - No, stick to tails. Well, that's life. I wouldn't let him, a double headed coin? Who needs a double headed coin? - Good night. - Good night. If you're going to take money of us, is that going to be with cards? No, next time we better try chloroform. Hello Jazz, go speak it out, will you? - Be careful when you cross the road. - You never say nice things like that to me. You watching a western? I wonder what would happen if one day they shot the hero. - Probably improve the program. - Am I wrong or are you later than usual? All you girls seem to say the same thing. I thought you were in the harbor tonight not up in the town. Less of course you can play the same game.. Five or six are even better, more money. I always wanted to know what that help us, it tickles. - What kind of day did you have? - The usual. Cleaned the house M. Moret talked and spilled cigarettes ashes on the floor, that's it. - Why do you keep her then? - It's lonely otherwise. But you're away all day and sometimes even at night. You haven't enough of that? No, I don't have to have enough of it but I feel like it. For the way you talk me I think I'm an alcoholic or something. It's just that the day gets long when you're alone most of the time. Of course I knew who I marry, people like you never change. But sometimes I wonder why I stayed. And sometimes I know why stayed married. I should've tell you, some idiot keep calling, don't say a word, then hangs up. I'll take care of it. What? The name is Joe Martin, M - A - R - T - I - N. - You have the wrong party. - Joe? Joe, what's the matter? - Some guy insisting my name is Joe Morin. - What else did he say? - Just, some kind of a nut. - What he want? He said he wanted to kill me. What kind of joke is this? I'm going to call the pol... No, it's not something for the police. I'll take care. The first, I want you out of the house, stay with mother. In the morning pick up the girl at camp. - I want you to get dress. - Joe, who... Do as I say. Wait a minute. It's Bertrand's, it's Lillian's birthday. Should we invite her to come over? How a lot of help they'd be in their condition. Go and lock up in the kitchen and pull all the curtains. Go upstairs, lock yourself in your room. Joe, be careful. Lock yourself in your room. Joe? Come in, come over way in. You bastard, he's an unarmed man. No, he'll live, I can't do it without him for the moment. I don't know what you're after. But you must like to know that the police are on their way over. - You wouldn't want to bet on that. - I called them right after your last call. Sure you did Joe wants the cops mix on this. Why shouldn't he? He can tell you that better than me. Go ahead Mrs. Morin, wake him up. What was that you called me? Oh, the name is Martin. - You're after the wrong man. - Maybe you married the wrong man, eh? He hasn't change much, I recognize him anywhere. Even from a picture 2 year old. What this got to do with him? Ah finally, bonsoir Mon sergeant. Isn't that's how they put it in your new country? Aren't you surprised to see your old friend Raymond? Surprised to see you act on your own, you always needed help before. You didn't like that, eh? Well, how about you're big and your tough? Specially when you're holding that, the lone ranger. So you don't need anybody to hold hands anymore, eh? Maybe I've learned to manage for myself. I have plenty of time in seven years... I better go. It's the police, you still got time to run for it, we don't talk. Fabienne, come on over to have a drink. Say, wanted you to join them for a drink. Those French cops, they know how to live, don't they? What do you want? Money? That's all we got in the house, go on, take it. - You must think I'm some kind of a crook. - Are you? You tell her, or doesn't she know about your army buddies? First of all, you tell me who this Joe Morin I'm suddenly married. Yes, tell her sergeant, go on, I got time. What are you doing back out in the streets? - I expected. - Expected? You didn't need that, you could've knocked me over with a feather. You didn't know we catch up with you sooner or later? - We? - I would or whoever Galards face. Figured. Al least you seem to know each other, you don't think I bet. - Yeah, I know him. - Well enough to hit you on the head. It happens in the best of families. How... - How did you know where to find me? - Show him. Is that Greek millionaire you saved. Yeah, yeah, I knew I should've let him drown. That's when I got the idea of the boat. What about the boat? I knew there was a one guy I could count one. To shares his last crust, even his fast boat. Well now, which... Which country you trying to get to? You find out later, for the moment just get down to the boat. - You must be crazy, now? - I said to the boat and now, get you coat. Well, I hope you know what you are doing. Oh yeah, my coat. Taking a boat out in the middle of the night. Fabienne, I'll see you later. - No sweat, the little lady is coming to. - What for? I'm sure you'll be easier to handle with this one around. I agree to take you, not her. Sarge baby, I don't think you heard me right. Get ready honey. Ok, don't argue with him, just do what Vermont says. OK, Ok. What is it Joe? You can tell the police it was self defense. Then what in heavens name are you afraid of? I still want you to go to your mother's, pick up Michele in the morning, go on. It must be pretty heavy what happens if you're trying to hide. Can't you ever do anything I tell you to do? Yes, it's ugly. So, that's what's been bothering you, your drinking, your bad nerves, your nightmares. They weren't souvenirs from the war in Korea. - No, they weren't souvenirs. - You lied to me then. No, I didn't lie, I just didn't bother to explain the reasons... for my nightmares or my drinking, got nothing to do with you. Of course, a man threatens you with a gun, you break his neck. We can't call the police but it's nothing to do with me. Oh, if you put it that way... You better hear from me first, sit down I'll get you a drink. You remember me talking about Ross, Captain Ross, my commanding officer in Korea. He was a good soldier, but one thing I didn't tell you. After the shooting stop though there, we were transfer... back to Germany and this got a little to quiet for him. So started a little business on the side. Beginning with graft, kickbacks from service clubs and ending hijacking US army trucks, He sold the stuff in the black market. Sometimes around his headquarters you couldn't tell the mafia from the army. Oh boy, he must've a lot of loot stash away somewhere. And you were mixed up with him? No, I never fraternized with officers, except in the stockade... where all men were made equal. They were here ended up only because... while is alright for officers to... still from the army you shouldn't make a pig out of yourself. You didn't tell what you were doing in the stockade? One Saturday night when I couldn't see straight from this stuff... I bolted and officer, happened to be a chicken colonel. He was sure asking for it. Everybody was happy I hit him. Got two years just the same. When Ross invited me to pass out with him to Vermont... and Ross knew I was a damn good driver. I thought, why not? I'd nothing to lose, I'm still with the army anyhow. It all started out smoothly, you know. The breaking well planned. The hardest part was over, we only had to climb down the outer wall. There we had a man waiting, he's name was Katanga, ex-foreign legion. He had new clothes ready for us, a fast car, false papers. But then a German cop happened along. Had to put his nose into it. Wanted to see our papers. I didn't want any part of that action. You know, they each received 20 years in a German prison. And if I had stocked around I would've gone at least 10, for what? You'll have to go to the police one day. And give up everything I work for all those years? Far beyond. And you and Michelle? What would you do when I'm away? We wait. Like hell, I wait. But with you two away, I can take care of everything here. Including him? I'm only wait for the street stand still... I take care of that problem like we do in the army, sweep it under the rug. I'll be down in a minute. Just pack a small suitcase, you might not have to be away long. You don't understand, I'm coming with you. No, Fabianne, that makes you an accessory. I became that the day I married you. Open up Joe, I can see your light on. Fabienne, turn one small light on. I've lost the key to the back door, go around the front. Let them in. I'm coming, I'm coming. At last... - Come on over. - Bonsoir, everybody. You don't like music Jazz. Come on, let see what I could think. I would've come to you party earlier, but... Fabienne... Let's see now, I've some whiskey. We mustn't keep you up, ice is only we need. Can I help you? Oh no, no, just all my things, you hadn't come in. Alright, have it your way. - Hurry up Fabianne. - Yes, I'm coming. Come right over here? Anyone want lip this? You sure. - There you are. - Come on, let's go back to the house. - Good bye. - Good night. Even if we wanted to, we can't go to the police. Don't forget to lock, ok? Go back of the road and keep your eyes open, Ok? Ok. Joe, look out. - Are you Ok? - Don't worry, I'm. Sure, we can give you a ride and we still have some time for a drink, a whiskey a gogo. I'll be glad to, would you mind if I bring my husband? Wait here Fabianne, I'll get some things to clean up the car. Jazz, Jazz... Get the hell out of hear. - I remember when you used to call me sir. - Get out sir. Jazz? Oh, Jazz? Katanga isn't sentimental about animals like we Americans. Joe, what's keeping you? I can imagine why you run out in the night Joe with an wife like that and available. - She was just leaving, come on. - She's not living us just yet. Make some more coffee. Seem to be kept around, you might as well introduce your friends? My friends? That's Ross, Fausto and this Katanga, if I remember right? - You remember right. - He's a ex-foreign legion. Crack soldiers, the French specially proud of them. They always look so good marching down the Champs Elisees on the 14 of July. They never try to forget what they did to people in Indochina or Algeria. Not that we Americans has done to badly since we took over, in Indochina I mean. We haven't arrive in Algiers yet. Now that you have me thoroughly scared, what the hell you want? First, I want to balance the books. Secondly, I'd like to know where Vermont is. Vermont? He made a brake with you? You got to let him behind, we not liked that. Where is he? I can see he's been here. Beats me. The captain asked you a question. Why don't you tell the captain I don't know? - We'll talk to you later. - Oh yes, what did you do with Vermont? You dump his body somewhere, eh? And makes even more convenient, doesn't it? Especially if you have any bright idea as call the police. As I should've done a long time before. Then Joe would be on his way to jail by now instead of me. No hard feelings sergeant, we just send Vermont up to face you. But if he couldn't a little thing like that I guess... not much of a loss, once we got you to take his place. Why don't you just spell it out? Why we stand here? Gibbering with that rat. - Why don't? - Shut up. It's his Italian blood, get so excited about it. If I weren't here, you would have to proof your brain by now. Fausto, I don't have a guilty conscience over you or you. Or anybody else, except maybe that German cop. I came along as a driver Ross. When the killing started, that finished it. - Oh come on now, you must've realized. - It wasn't necessary to kill that cop. But that nut over there, he enjoyed doing it. A matter of good soldier, wouldn't you say? A man enjoys killing. - You a good soldier once Joe. - Ross, you speaking for yourself. Now, let's get down to business. How much do you figure I owe you? How much is for spare longs? Do I hear any bets? I'll make an offer on your behalf. One nice, comfortable seagoing boat, ships papers, all notarized with a name like... Leinad II, for instance. The ship is about everything we've got in the world, you know how much that boat cost? Enough to balance the books, almost anyway. Yeah, but you just forget it, it's no deal. Somehow Joe, I don't think you're in much of a position of refuse us anything. Ross... sooner or later I'm going to catch you with your guard down. And you too. I haven't forgot anything you taught me. Oh, I trained you well but you forget one thing Joe. No much good to win a war when you lost civilian population. No prob if you don't care what happens to her. The marriage is been kind of rocky lately, hasn't it? Oh no, you shouldn't believe all you heard down in a port. Fishermen always exaggerate. - Where is that you want to go? - You'll find out later. Tomorrow is just to see if you can in and out without customs control. All I want you is to take a small exit with Katanga. Very touching, but you don't have to worry, he'll be coming back. We don't want anything to happen to him, not with the cargo he might be carrying. Now it's beginning to make sense. - Why you want my boat. - It's a matter of trust. And you, given the right circumstances, I could rely on you. You don't trust me enough to tell me what's in the cargo, eh? No, it's a vicious circle. I don't trust you, Katanga doesn't trust us... he wont end of the cargo till he's been paid. I trust you Captain but my friends in Marseille just don't know you and so... It's the world we live in, anyway the money should be here by the time you get back. Now Fausto, don't you forget to go pick up Moira at the airport. - Swissair from Geneva. - If that crazy brau had made the plane. No, she'll be there, so far everything worked out perfectly. - In fact, with military precision. - Including Vermont? There's lot of casualties in any operation. Suppose I say... no more casualties and I don't go along with them. Telephone is right there, you can also call the police. Joe, for God's sake please, don't do it. The police here, what is your name? - Good morning Captain. - Good morning. I'm sorry but there's been a mistake in the booking. This gentleman has the boat this morning. - But Joe... - Violet, get another boat. Call Pierre or... somebody. - Very pretty girl. - Yeah. The little German girl, she's very pretty. - Too bad we can bring her on board to you. - You just worry about your women. - Where to? - Up there. Why don't you put that away, you're liable to hurt yourself. - Mind telling me where I'm going? - Like your are, just going. Like the captain said, you're simple with me. - Seven years. - Don't remind me. - What is like in a German prison? - You're in the inside, looking outside. There's a lot of ocean out there, which part you want to try first? Head to the Inner Islands and no foolishness. It's time I rather explain something yo you. As long as you're holding my wife, I can't call the police... and I can't do anything about you, so put the thing away. But if any harm should come to her, god help you. God help you all. There she is, Turkish flag. Turkish flag mean she's smuggling opium, probably already processing to heroin. - You read the wrong set of books. - I get around. That's what I heard. I never thought I'd see you with that wife and daughter. - Stepdaughter. - 12 years old. Interesting age. - You say you are Michele's father? - Well, her stepfather, yes. Then I'm really confuse, I know your wife. She was here half an hour ago. - She was what? - She and her husband. She said she want to take Michele home for the 14 of July celebration. - You sure? - Of course I'm. Can you identify yourself? After all I don't know you. What did my wife husband look like? Well... Never mind, never mind, thanks. Excuse, sil-vous-plait. Someone left a cache-case sitting on the floor right outside the locker room. The name on it is Fausto Gelardi. - Do you have the...? - No, I don't have. But I think you ought to have him page, otherwise somebody might picked it up. Wasn't women losing things. Will Mr. Fausto Gelardi please go down to the clock room. We have found your attache case. Will Mr. Fausto Gelardi please go down to the clock room. We have found your attache case. Moira? - Here. Let me help you with that. - Thought Fausto was meting me. Well, he got nail going through a traffic light, left him sitting arguing with a cop. - Some nasty option. - You'll make a great godfather. - Sure that's not to heavy for you? - Thank you, I can manage. The car is right outside. Well, how long do you know Ross? 3 months, he hid up in my place when he escape jail. That fella give a lot of confidence to you. He knows I'm not worldly type. I've always had money, takes more than that to turn me on. What does turn you on? Freedom to do what I like, to smoke what I like... To bold who I like. Even to kill if I had to, like Ross. No wonder you find you simpatico. - Man usually do. - Enough to marry you? Hey, you aren't just gall? Now look, I had enough of that by home. Mummy and daddy, enemies up to the knife, right? But always deadly polite in front of the children. Beautiful, but 2 dogs with their teethes in each other throats. - How long have you known Ross? - Oh, years. We did time together. Imagine, put a man of his talent in prison. - That's what's get him in, his talents. - No. - He was betrayed, let down by a friend. - Some people on this world are just no good. What's that you smoking? - You want one? - No chance. - Is this going to Beaulieu? - Yes. Ross said he had some unfinished business here with that friend. That's been taken care off. - Did he kill him? - Not yet. - But he will. - That's seem general idea. - I've seen a man killed. - It's a ball of laughs. - We just past a sign say Grasse. - Grasse? Oh, yeah, yeah, Grasse. Where are we going now? This is a shortcut, it might saves us about 15 minutes. - You're not going to try any funny business? - No, not unless you force me. I don't want to go this way. Why not? I think you better take me back to the main road. What for? Well, I don't want to continue until I know where this road goes. But why you have that? Better turn this car around, you hear me? You just sit back and relax, I know who you are. Everybody out. - What you going to do with me? - Well, not what I like haven't got the time. - My God. - Here we are. Make yourself at home baby, let it up. - You want to leave me here? - Until my wife and daughter are safe. - Give me that. - Oh, no. You bastard, you think Ross let go things that easily? Depends on how badly he wants his money or you. Whichever he loves more. I'll be here for weeks, he'll think you're bluffing. He might. I could take a handful of hair but I take this will be more convincing. Oh, look at that. Here, help yourself and count that. You bastard, you can't leave me here, you can still be creep. Bastard, you come back here, you... you creep, you bastard, you come back here, you can't leave me here. - Never learn, will you? - Alright. - Is Michele upstairs? - Yes, she's alright. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Oh come on, you're wasting your time, I'm not about to endanger the civilian population. He's no the one who start the shooting. I could've brought either that or a handful of hair. Ross, I think you ought to marry that girl, she's crazy about you. - Crazy, anyhow. - Where is she? In a safe place, she's scared to death. A lot of little crawling things around her that she's crying her heart out. But she's alright. - What do you have in mind? - We make a trade. You know, the way I got her hid, maybe be 3, 4 weeks... before anybody came along and all she got to eat is money. If we let you wife and daughter go? You get Moira, the money and if you still want it, a free boat ride. It's a trade. - Get Michele. - Fausto, go with her. Just a minute, we need two boat rides. One to take out the stuff from the Turkish boat and the other for yours. - That's how we to be. - Still playing games with the mafia, eh? You know a better way to maintain you in business? The cost of living is growing up in South America. Everything is going to be Ok now. - Ready whenever you are. - You just stay close to me. You stay close to them Katanga. - Slow down. - You getting seasick? Don't worry, we'll get you back the camp soon. You think this is the place? I think, it better be. Slow down. - So, where's Moira? - What's the matter? Don't you trust me? I somehow trusted you, cost me seven years. - Down there? - Maybe. I don't know why should trust you. Ross, I want you let my wife and daughter leave in that car. Then we'll finish making the trade. - You still have me. - Ok. - Katanga, stay with us now. - And what about them? - He'll take us to her. - Is your to lose. Somebody has to trust somebody. - Are you sure this is what you want? - Yes, what I want. It's a silly thing to say but be careful. Hold it. You alright darling? And you killed Fausto, bastard. Take me to that car. Help, let me out of here. Out. Come on you. Go with him. - You let me out of here. - Go open the door. Where is Ross? Easy. Ross, what happened? I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not me, one of yours. Moira, whiskey, in the car. - Stomach wound, you shouldn't drink. - Shut up, go get it. I'm sorry. It's been a long waste, I'd always keep by women. Get going. Put it to my mouth. Daddy, can we all go home? Stay close to your ma and do everything she says. With a hole like that, you're not going to last longer. - What else do? - You need a doctor right now. I have to stop the bleeding. - How far is nearest doctor? - Half an hour. You'd better soak that in whiskey first. It's a half hour to Grasse. But today is the 14th of July, might be a lot of traffic. Captain is trying to con you into something. - You can get me there in 30, 30 minutes? - That's not what I said. - What do you talking about? - I'm saying that... if you move he'll bleed to death before he gets there. He's lying, Moira can take you. If you want me to. If you go right ahead Moira, you get there just... in time for the doctor to sign the death certificate. Well, the only thing you can do is bring the doctor here. - He's out of his mind captain. - No, looks me Joe is right. - You mean a doctor to come here? - Yes, where I am. It's crazy, we have to wait. Then late tonight, then I'll take you to a doctor. Katanga, try to understand what I'm about to say. May not be easy to you, but make a supreme effort. This a stomach wound, stomach wound is bleeds internally. I know what's a wound in the gut. But do you know how many pints of blood a human has? He has 10 pints. And mine is pumping out, slowly but steadily. At an estimated rate of 4 pints per hour. Therefore in another hour I should lose consciousness and finally check-out. And you in your wondrous stupidity... stand there and suggests I'll wait till late tonight. Maybe I'm stupid. Stupid enough to know you should kill these and cut out now. Those who can. Listen to me you... Get it for me, the money. Quickly. There, enough to buy yourself two doctors and an undertaker. Good bye captain, good bye sir. Drop the schmeiser, now the money. Keep the schmeiser over here Joe. Check him over. And in case... my gun is pointed to your wife and daughter. Ross, I think you better let me get you that doctor. I guess the longer we was around here, the more blood I lose. Moira, you go too. Pick up that gun, don't hesitate to use if he left you. Would be a pleasure. Please, let him take the child with him please. Sure, let them all go. We just sit here holding hands. Wife and daughter stay. Joe knows if he cries cops, he don't have a wife... and daughter when he comes back, just two statistics. You have to go, we've only one chance. Take care of your mother till I come back. Joe, you realize I'm the sole protector the mother and child? They'll be alright. Good, I'll be here, I'll be around for the next 60 minutes. That is till 4:26. After that... You forgot something. But don't just stand there, get in. Well, I did not want make any wrong moves. No. Get in the car, get in or I'll give you one of this, get in. In front. Nice car your friends got. I'm going to need two hands to drive, here. You wanted this gun Katanga? Come get it. Or you prefer your old Schmeisser? Know something captain? I can do that. Know that put in a lot of lead weight. But I'll take you with me captain sir. Even with a full clip in my gut. I'll take you first and then... - I got time for them too. - Yes, you might have it. You're move Katanga. I can wait. Me, I am not bleeding inside. And if you don't want to be, as you were, on the floor, backing that wall. As you like. You... I ought you something. Captain please give the other gun, let me hold it. I give you my word I won't use on you. I give you my word I won't leave you while you still alive. If something happens to you, at least we have a last chance. Sure, give her the piece captain sir, what's a piece between friends? Guns is just not you see. Your job, make sure I stay awake. - Make me some coffee, black, hot, strong. - Ok. Come. Captain, if I have a gun, he can go for both of us at once. I told you, you couldn't kill a virus infection. Killing him wouldn't be murder. It would be like cleaning a cesspool. - You tough. - It's in the family. Get your tools kit, you're coming with me it's an emergency. - That you're going to make one. - Never mind the cracks, move. - And what's the nature of this emergency? - It's a bullet hole in the stomach. - Exit wound? - No. - Long ago. - About 40 minutes. - Much external bleeding. - Doctor, your stalling and there isn't time. But I have to know what to take. Nurse, nurse, hurry up. Yes doctor, what is it? 6 units of plasma, saline solution and hemostat. - Alright doctor. - Please, do it quickly. - Hurry, hurry, I that clock right? - Yes. There's only 27 minutes to go. - Oh, thank you, put it in my bag. - Give it to her, hurry, hurry. - Do you want an ambulance? - We don't need an ambulance, we have a car. But you have to call immediately to Mr. Auger, you tell him, yes, yes. Tell him I cancel his appointment, tell him I'm out to an emergency. Oh, where can I reach you? Allo, la police? Commissioner Auger sil-vou-plait? Still trust your old army friend? Do you think he'd be back? - You'll see him. - And with a doctor. Why? Because of you and the kid? Well, the kid isn't his. You think he was worry about you... when he killed Vermont and wouldn't let you call the police? You must stay awake, coffee, hurry. Joe and the doctor would be here any minute. You mean you can still see your watch in your arm? What time is it? Our friends have exactly seven minutes left. And how long you got? One minute to go, unless you were bluffing. You should've listened to me. You'd be all patched up by now and we could still do it. Even now I could carry you to the road and fly out a car and get a doctor. Don't listen to him, he'll kill you that way. Keep using that word, but anyway, in your army they don't call it killing. Waste them, eh? Isn't that what you Americans say when you've prisoners you don't want to bother about? - I thought Joe is a good driver. - Sure, like last time. Can be here any minute, just keep conscious. How much time is he got left? None, time is up. You know the police is following us? For the last 5 minutes, fasten your seat-belts. Faster. Son of a bitch, you tried to kill me this time. I thought I've done already, eh? Just can't wait. You won't be with us for long, that's for sure. Put that money back on the table. Go on, shoot me. Then you are all alone and I mean alone. Keep it. Captain sir, you know how long he's been gone? It's nearly 5 o'clock. Haven't time wait, wait. Keep awake, keep awake. Oh God. They're not in any hurry. Captain Ross, I can hear someone coming. - Listen, it's Joe and the doctor. - Eh? All I can hear is pum, pum. And blood squirting out between my fingers. Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake. That Joe sure fellow honestly. You a great lady. He'll be here, in a moment now. But I'd be? And you'd be here? No if you have any sense, you won't. You want me to write you a letter? What you think you're playing at? - You are going nowhere. - Neither you. - I need you to drive. - Drive you where? To a cemetery? If you do, you'll stay there with me. Come on. My ankle, it's tightened. - A little bit more now. - It's tightened. Come on, we got to keep on, come on. Stop. Stay where you are, don't move or I shoot the kid first. I guess the wind is helping us. Wait, we light, light the grass. Yes, light the grass, light the grass, Run, fast, run. Stay where you are. Up there. Come on, get out. Come on, hurry, this way here. Oh Joe. Stay where you are. Easy now. One burst will cut them in half. Now, throw your gun on the ground. She was empty anyway. Now I want to see how good a captain you are, with bell my boy. The boat, remember? Oh, it's Bastille day, we forgot to celebrate. Out, quickly. Don't do anything stupid. Alright, where we going? Same place as we were going this morning. Only this time I intend to get there. With or without your family. Oh yeah, the boat with the Turkish flag. That a new pick up point for heroin in this parts? - What happens after we get you there? - You think too far ahead. Enjoy the moment. Life is short and shorter for some than for others. We going to have to comeback, you know. Can make to Algiers with out picking up more fuel. Algiers? Not me, they cut off my legs with a rusty knife. Not a minute too soon. Going to stay on that boat? What you really want to know is when do I put you over the side. One like to know these things, yeah. And even if I told you, you'd still going driving me. Drive up to the last minute. Because there is always hope. Be careful. Hey Joe, you work the 14th of July? My wife wanted some fresh air, you call that working? They know you. They know you don't celebrate with your own wife. - The girl, how old did you say she was? - She's about eleven. - Eleven, you said twelve before. - What's that had to do with him? He thinks you are something special. On that we agree. - Katanga, can I ask you something? - What? Do you have children of yours? You seem to think it's very funny. - Were you ever married? - Do I look like married? I wouldn't know, you don't have to look in a special way. What are you doing there? My legs are tired. How about getting a chair. Don't want get too comfortable, you may fall asleep. Katanga, won't you let us go once we left you on the boat? I guess I better go to the police about Vermont. Either that or wait for them to come looking for me. - Would they put you in jail for this? - Who knows? They left and they didn't catch Michele and me. - For what? - Starting forest fire. Ah, monsieur, I that your car? No, but I like to talk yo you about something else. No, not before I caught the maniac who drove this car. Because if it the last thing I do, I'm going to see he gets 6 months. - Six months. - Yes, 6 months. Six months. I'm hungry. - I'm hungry. - And I am hungry.
