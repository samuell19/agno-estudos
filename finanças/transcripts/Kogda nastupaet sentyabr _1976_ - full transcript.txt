When September Begins... Repeat: Flight 902 from Yerevan has landed... Dear passengers, we ask you to keep seated until the engines have been fully switched off and the ramp has been installed. Repeat: We ask you... Wait, Valik-djan! - Ah, good job, good job! - Where are you hurrying to? Levon-dai! Let's wait. Wah! Listen, wait for whom? Go ahead, ahead! This man doesn't know what he says, listen! I don't understand: am I being late or you are? I'm not late to anywhere! No! I am already here! Listen, Bulgaria is going mad that he's still not there! Go ahead! - Dear? - Yes? - Did they like Armenia? - Of course! Ah! Good man! Good man! Good man! Daughter, thank the pilots for me! Tell the captain that I wanted to thank him myself, but there's a man being late, - I'm afraid I'll hold him back. - I will. Does he know you? - Who? - The captain. How? No! - But he will be pleased! - Goodbye! A good word never hurt anybody. - Goodbye, daughter! - Goodbye! Why are you standing there? Go! Listen, the people will get it! We're already home, but you're going abroad! - Why are you cutting the line? - To friends, yes, - but still abroad! - Go back in the line! He's got a very important business! Stepan, wait! - Stand where you stood! - What a weird man! - Oh who did I press! - We are who we are! Respect order! Wait, listen! You don't want to listen to me! There's a whole other business! - There's Bulgaria... - What Bulgaria? Wine, sun! You see? There were friends who came to us to the Ararat valley, then left to their Bulgarian valley! Took seedlings with them. Waiting for a master now! Waiting for a wizard! Waiting and waiting! For him! A wizard, see! They're waiting for him! - Go then! - He doesn't have a right, understand? Doesn't have a right, see! Doesn't have a right to be late! Our plane got delayed a little. And his plane to Bulgaria might leave soon! How horrible! - See, he understands! - How could I not? - Please go and explain it. - Thank you! - They'll let you through. - Minutes could impact everything! If he's late and doesn't come to Bulgaria, the Bulgarian wizards won't meet an Armenian wizard, and then wine wouldn't be born, thick as resin, red like blood! Understand? Only wine on his mind! - Wah! - My daughter is about to give birth! This is so great, listen! Let God give your daughter a gorgeous boy, mother! We will drink this wine at his wedding! Wine, blooming like three gardens! Sweet like a first kiss! Sweet like the life that I wish for your daughter! - Thank you for the kind word. - How else, mother! People, I've been standing here for hours! Go, go! - Let them through, if that's the case. - Told you, people are people everywhere! - I don't object. - Thank you, dear! Let them be. Sit down, sit down. Say a big hello from me to our Bulgarian friends! From Levon Pogosyan. - They will be pleased! - Thank you! Thank you, Levon-dai! - Let's go. - Wait! Go where? You don't know my daughter's number! Write it down! Come back and tell us how it went! I will be worried! 284-41-31. - Do phone us! Really do! - Thank you! - Thank you, Levon-dai! Let's go. - Good luck! Thank you so much, Valik-djan! - A friend? - We've met on the plane. See, he's from Artashat, I'm from Ashtarak. Spent three hours on the plane talking. He talked about himself, I talked about myself. A golden guy! Golden! Thank you! Is he your relative? No, mother-djan! We've met on the plane! Golden guy! Golden! What does this mean, people? What does this mean? They take two cars, cutting the line- - You stop that! Stop! - No no no, beauty, no! I'm not in a hurry! My daughter got a separate apartment, come whenever you like! - Look at him! - I don't care for time! - No, lady-djan, no! - How come? Do we keep waiting? Daughter got a separate apartment not long ago, two rooms. Wah, the air! They wrote to me. There's a forest right behind the house! What else does my grandson need? Volodya, her husband is a master! He makes, uh... - Textiles? - Yes! - He dresses people up. - Dad, where are you going? - Go ahead! - Oh no, you go! I'm not in a hurry! Go, go! Everyone's busy, everyone got things to do. I have a job tomorrow. Tomorrow my grandson starts school! You know the school song? - I do! Got two kids of my own. - Ah, good lady! Two? Good lady! Father! Stand here! - I'll go there. - Come on! Stand here! Thank you! For you, for you, for you. For you, for you, for you. No, you never loved me. Nune, are you insane? You didn't look once at me this entire evening. Nune, you can see yourself that I'm struggling here. So what? I never wanted to be a singer's wife. What singer could I be? You know it well: Amateur performing - a social duty. We'll finish and... "Finish". You're a family man, not young anymore. Happy when three thousand girls are staring at him all admiring. Nune. Our factory only has 800 weavers. Half of them are grannies. I know what they're like. You are so silly, after all! Volodya? Leave this factory, I plead you! I just want us to have a good life. - Father! - It's me! Weren't expecting me, huh! Dad! Djan! Nune-djan! Father, come on, where's your conscience! Why didn't you write? We would've met you. What meeting, listen! Am I from a united nation or something? Wah! Wah, Volodya! You could've guessed that I'd come on such a day! Where is my grandson? Where- - Sleeping, dad. - Sleeping? I want to look at him. Go set the table, go. Volodya-djan, I will go look at my grandson. Quietly, I won't wake him up. Just try! I held him upside down once - didn't wake up! This is my grandson! Mine! I was sleeping near Volokolamsk before the attack. Slept through the entire artillery preparation! This is my grandson! - Where is he? - There. There? I'll be quiet. Copy. My copy. I was exactly the same as a child. My nose. - Dad? - Djana? You will sleep in that room and I'll stay with Levon. I will sleep with Levon! I came to him, not to you two, you silly woman! He's not sleeping? Not used to a new place. A stroke, maybe? Dad, why aren't you sleeping? Are you unwell? I wanted to try your water. Go to your husband, woman! Go! Dad? Is the scrap coming out again? It's been trying to for 30 years. So what? I'm fine. Bagrad's already got a dissertation out of my scraps. A doctorate! 11 cuts, just you listen, 11! That is nothing. Nothing. Galustovna raised a good son. Remember Galustovna? I do. Listen, we celebrated her 70th birthday recently. - Why are you hiding from me? - Oh, Volodya-djan, we're talking. Pour us some wine! Father, we've got work tomorrow. Wah! Listen, a glass of wine won't hurt. Sit down, barik-djan, sit down. Sit down. - Nune, do you remember old Sumbat? - The guard? - Yes. - I remember. Good, good! You know, Volodya-djan, old Sumbat had a son. What a guy! Ay, died in 1945! His medal was found recently. Nune-djan, all of us villagers got together and built a spring well after his name, in the middle of the village. Wah! Let people come, drink the water and remember him. We need to remember. Babano-djan. - Dad? - Ay, djan? What is auntie Hasmik doing? Wah! Auntie Hasmik! I have a picture, auntie Hasmik with children. I'll show it. These are all relatives, Volodya-djan! You must know! How else! I'll show it. Auntie Hasmik. One moment. One moment, one moment. Ah, here! This is auntie Hasmik, look. This is auntie Hasmik, and thi- no, not the daughter, this is Farsit the niece. Grandpa, why does everyone have flowers but us? Because we are men, my boy. We have something better! That's alright. Akulov Kolya! Simankina Valya! Talkintsev Zhenya! Zubrova Masha! - Ivanova Katya! - Go. Kondrikov Levon! - Kondrikov! - Grandpa, I'm Kondrikov. Wah, that's right! Kondrikov is here, here! Go! Go, djavanda! Listen, and I'm here waiting for a Pogosyan to get called! I'm Pogosyan, he's Kondrikov. Although he should be Pogosyan! He's my grandson! Little Levon is the son of my daughter Nune! My blood, listen! My blood! My blood. No! He will not disgrace our kin in these holy walls! No! And neither will your children! Am I right, people? You're right, father! Son, I've flown 3000 kilometers to see this! Understand? Three thousand kilometers! And now, people, let's celebrate this day that we must not forget! Hold this! The calendar marks this day with regular ink, but it is marked red in our hearts! Have this! Come on, folks, gather round! Take it! After our children! After our children! Let's drink! After our children! Your health! Let our children only make us happy! And your daughter too! - I have two sons! - Wah, good! Your health! Brother-djan, come to us! Come! Why are you there alone? Today is a celebration! A celebration, that's true. But indecent. Move further away at least, this is a school. Wah, on such a day? This is not vodka or gnarly cognac, this is wine! Pink like a bride! Young like our children that are already there! Please come to us! "A bride". That still won't do, old man. Listen, why? Strange man. Says it won't do! Too bad you're not listening to me, Mikhail Mikhailovich! I'm telling you to get Gena the plumber! He was cooking stuff in the boiler room all night. Cooking what? Press him and he'll break, I tell you! What do you want, mister? Why did you stop? Go where you were going! Wah, wait, listen! I live here! The comrade is interested, he might be useful in our business. - Matveyev from the precinct. - Levon Pogosyan. Our trade is like that, anything can lead to a clue. You, for example, are an old man, your eye is sharp. Have you noticed anyone yesterday at about twelve next to that gray Zhiguli? - That one? - Yes. At twelve... Wait! Wait. Right about twelve I was tucking Levon in when I looked out the window. No. No, the moon was shining, everything was bright. No, no one was there. Not in the night. That's the thing, it was daytime. At 11am the owner left his car here, number plate 66-25 MKM. At 13:07 he comes out and hello! Four rims gone. No, at twelve I was at the airport in Yerevan. Eleven people saw me off. I came to my daughter Nune. She lives here. Seventh floor, apartment 49. - My grandson Levon... - Just you look at it! Useful! They're all useful to come here without registration! Wait here! Think twice before speaking once! "No registration!" Hold it. - "No registration". - Come on! Why did you interrupt me? Listen, why you, so young, have interrupted me? Do you know what my father used to do when a woman interrupted him? - Do you? - Threats! He's threatening me! I'm scared of these Muslims more than of death! They don't even think us women are people! Wah! - Here, take your stuff! - Wait! - No, look at my passport! - Fine, fine, dad! Have a nice stay at your daughter's place. Don't be mad at Anastasia Vasilyevna, she's upset. Everything has always been fine here, and now this incident. - I understand. - That's fine, we'll find them. I'm telling you, get Gena! Press him, he'll break! Been cooking stuff in the boiler room all night. Cooking what? What were they cooking? Why? Press him and he'll break! I feel it! I feel it! I suspect it! Don't listen to her. You will find them yourself, lieutenant-djan, because you are a good man, I can see it. And I, Levon Pogosyan, will help as much as I can! Seventh floor, apartment 49 is your home! Come visit! Thank you, comrade Pogosyan! Good day! I'm Levon Pogosyan, your neighbour. Nune's father. Do you know? Oy! Wait, neighbour-djan! I... Nune! Flat 49. Ah, we haven't met yet. - Hello! - Hello! Come in! Why stand at the doorstep. Such close neighbours are almost relatives! Understand? I've met your son in the elevator today! Yes! I walked my grandson to school. For the first time. Imagine, grandad flew here just to walk his grandson to school for the first time! I think it is just wonderful! - Really? - Of course. Neighbour-djan! Wah, you are such a good person! You should get to love my daughter. Become a mother to her. You see, she's alone here. A young woman. Well, she does have a husband, a son, but! Husband and son are a husband and a son. But a woman's help? - That is true. - Yes. So I have also come to you like to a close friend for advice. Understand? - What is your name? - Nina Petrovna. Nina-djan, here. I've bought what auntie Goar has asked for. Auntie Goar has a golden heart! Let God gift her nothing but happiness! I sure bought. Wah, I look at it now: is that happiness a little too big for auntie Goar? Nina-djan, can you look at it, as a woman? Here. Here, look. Is your friend quite plump? Auntie Goar? Wah! She birthed nine children! Nine, understand! Of course, that can be. It's a rarity nowadays. What is this? We've just painted the ceiling and now flat 53 is at it again! 53? - What a misfortune! - Ay! Let's go! - Let's go to flat 53! Let's run! - Oh God! Finally! - A flood! - Listen, where is leaking? Where? "Where"? Better ask where it doesn't! Why don't you have instruments? Hello! This is not a plumber, it's our neighbour. Neighbour? Why the hell is he here? My god! Everyone wants to be everywhere! What happened here? Oh, just like flat 101! Everyone was at work and water seeped through three floors! Are you Gena the plumber? Yes? Look me in the eye. Well? No. It is not him. I swear by my mother's memory, not him! Hey, father, don't play games with me. I have enough things to do. Good man, good man! Why does that lady sweep not like you? Anastasia? Why should she like me? She keeps inviting me to movies. What should I be doing there with her? There's 85 kilo in her, not counting anger. Wah, Gena! Wah, good man! I love you! I do! - Do you know why I do? - Why? Because you don't like evil people! Oh wow! You must come to Ashtarak, I'll make such shashlyk for you - you'll eat your fingers with it! Why go that far? - Feed me here. - Hah! I don't have a mangal here! Can you make me one? - Can you do it? - Draw it and I'll do it! Really, you'll do it? - Yeah! - Wah, Gena-plumber! Good man! You're not interested in what I do. I can worry, die, but you'll keep watching and thinking about your own stuff. I never get advice from you. You won't listen anyway, you'd do it your way. I would do everything, Volodya, just to hear kind advice from the closest person in the world! - Nune. - But you don't care! I do care. I told you, a person such as Yevgeny Viktorovich must be invited only to the best restaurant. To "Prague", I think. To "Prague". Grandpa. Why don't you like my "Prague" proposal? Who are we going to deceive? Yevgeny Viktorovich? Why deceive? Volodya, can't you think of something interesting? Think of what? I don't know. Fine. Countryside on Sunday. A picnic. To put such a man on wet grass? Ay! What's all this! Levon-djan! Go to your room. - Go. - Thanks, mom. Why are you arguing with your husband? Where did you learn that from? In front of a child, too! - My God! - I don't understand! Who do you want to invite? Her thesis supervisor. A great man, he treats Nune very well. We've been to his country house recently. - Now we need... - We need to invite him, wah! "To a restaurant"! A dear guest should be invited into the house! When he crosses your doorstep, he becomes your close friend! In a restaurant, big words are leaking from a slimy heart. Only in the house! The house! - Your father says that! - House... What will I cook? - Chicken? - Wah, why chicken? No! No! I will walk Levon to school tomorrow, and go look for real lamb. We'll make basturma! Invite that professor of yours! We'll make shashlyk! You know, grandpa, I decided to get married. - Marry who? - Katya. Remember the girl who stood near us on the first day? - Ah, I do. - We sit at the same desk. Well? We talked yesterday. So? She agreed. No, I'm just thinking, is it too early? You are so young. Not now, grandpa, in the fifth grade. Ah, fifth grade? Can do that. Although, you know, I had different plans. I wanted you to marry auntie Hasmik's niece. Wah! All women from that house are made of gold! No! No! If a man of our kin gave his word, it's final! - Final! - Grandpa? Grandpa, I don't know how to tell mom about it. You know her. If I were you, I'd wait. Let's tell her when the wedding is near. What happened, old man? No, nothing, brother-djan. The damned scrap is moving again. What scrap? Sit down. Oy, got wounded by a shrapnel shell in '43, pieces have been coming out since then. Spent three months in a hospital, and 30 years later it's still moving. I thought I was a goner this time. Young Bagrad, Galustovna's son, took them out. Let him live in good health! And I said, well, Bagrad-djan, that's it! You wrote a dissertation about my shrapnel, it's all over. He said no, it's not over. "Don't leave". I even laughed at him back then. It passes. Where did you serve? Batovky, 65. Second Belarussian front. Huh. We were neighbours. Let's get acquainted. Pogosyan Levon. Ivanov Nikolay Nikolayevich. Lieutenant colonel in retirement. I have to. I'm a petty officer, comrade colonel. Sit, old man. We're both just soldiers in retirement. Old men. That's true. You came back to your regiment from the hospital. - You found it. - I did. You didn't fully heal. They said later, comrade lieutenant colonel. That's right. Stop with the titles and all the formalities. I told you we're both old soldiers and nothing more! - Alright. - Fought enough battles, that's it. Where are you getting mended up nowadays? In a military hospital or in a civilian one? No, I told you: young Bagrad, Galustovna's son. - Listen, 32 years old, golden hands! - Just a boy! Wah, lieutenant colonel-djan, golden hands! What does he understand about old wounds? - Did you steam it? - What? Went to a sauna? - No. - You had to steam it, on the top bank, would've forgotten about it ages ago. All that German scrap would've fallen out of you like change! You'll go to sauna with me, I'll steam you there like a soldier. Got it? - Yes, lieutenant colonel-djan! - This again? Here you go. Can I take these away? You can, daughter, you can! Thank you, thank you! Wah! Thank you! No! I'll go back to Ashtarak and build a sauna. I'll invite everyone! The young, the old! Come in, folks, and enjoy! That's right, brother. Just like we have it in Red Presnya. I was born there, soldier, I was taught how to get steamed there, and that's where I wanted to die. But I cannot die just yet. The higher instance does not allow that. Listen, why should you die? Live for 120 years and then 120 more! I don't need 120, but 15 is a must. That's how it is. Wait-wait. Why are you talking about death? Death does not exist! While we are here - she's not here! When she comes - we won't be here! You know, brother-djan, I want to live forever. I swear! Life is a good thing! That's true, soldier. We didn't run away from death. Maybe she, the bastard, will start running away from us? But I do need about 15 more years. I do. There is a reason, right, brother-djan? We'll talk about it later. - Let's not spoil the mood. - Oh, as you wish! Better tell me, do you feel young? Feel the energy in your bones? Listen, it's as if I'm 20 again. Nothing hurts! What did I say! What happened? Why are you late? Nothing, nothing! One our good friend didn't come today, and us, hot-headed Caucasians, got worried for her too. Levon, get changed, let's go eat. If she doesn't come to us tomorrow then we'll come to her! Grandpa! - Grandpa, will we really go to Katya tomorrow? - Wah! A man's word! Maybe something has happened. We're their close friends, after all. Go change, Levon-djan. Let's go eat. Hello! Hi. Nune, hello! Hello. How are things in Ashtarak? Uncle Levon, I'm not from Ashtatark, I think you forgot. I'm from Riga! You gave me this address, so I came! Wah, listen, how could I forget! He applied to the theater academy! Tsinadali, wah! My children, remember this day! The best performer is in your house! Laertes works as a dentist in Ashtarak! But he is really a performer! But what a good dentist he is! He once pulled auntie Hasmik's tooth so fast that she didn't even have time to slap him! No! I had no doubts that you would get accepted! No! I'm happy altogether with you, Laertes-djan! Uncle Levon, I wasn't accepted again. Now why? A wall of anger and jealousy has blocked my way. Well, just like we have it in Yerevan, in Rostov-on-Don, in Odessa, in Harkov, drama and conspiracies everywhere. But I won't give up! Yes! I'm going to Tashkent. They will regret it later! I will get back to them just like Shalyapin did. He was rejected too, by the way. Yes! I forgot to introduce myself! - This is my daughter, Laertes-djan! - I know everything about you, uncle Levon told me! Laertes Dadashyan - performer. Nune-djan, set the table, our guest has just arrived. - Volodya Kondrikov. - Nice to meet you. Laertes-djan, let me show you where you will live. - Yes, yes. - Let's go, Laertes-djan. This is Levon's room, Laertes-djan. I sleep here. No, you'll be with us. Yes, you'll be with us. Volodya-djan, borrow a cot from the neighbours for Laertes-djan. Hello! Dad? What? Wah! Gena-djan, did you bring it? Barely, father! Good man, Gena-djan! I'll help you! Laertes, Volodya, come look! Look what he brought! He even made holes! Levon, come here! - Will we party? - We will party! This is what I was talking about! We'll be making shashlyk! No! You will never go anywhere, Laertes-djan! Grandpa. Grandpa, are you sleeping? Hey, why aren't you sleeping? Grandpa, will we visit Katya tomorrow? Listen, I gave you a man's word, right? Don't worry. Sleep, Levon-djan. Sleep. - Hello. - Hello, vali-djan! - Are you ill? - Yes. My throat was that swollen, but now it's all right. - Please come in. - Let's go. Where is your grandad? In the kitchen. Should I show you? No-no, I'll do it myself! You can play with Levon. Right, vali-djan? Let's go, Levon. That's alright, brother-djan. I understand everything. Listen, weren't women doing men's jobs when were at war? That's alright. No, I thought you got ill. Came thinking maybe you need help? I didn't get ill. Katya did. I cannot get ill. That's how it is. Have a seat. It's only Katya and I. That's how life twisted it. My old woman only lasted for two years after the Leningrad blockade. And daughter with her husband died a year ago. In Pamir. They were geologists. So now it's only Katya and I. Getting ill is out of the question. I must raise her. - What did you say? - I said: - Katya and I decided to get married. - So? - He said: too early. - And you? And I said: not now, in fifth grade. - And he? - He agreed. Katya, now go tell your grandpa. Later. If you want, we can do it together? No, I'll do it, just not now. Later. Wait. I'll tell my daughter, she'll come and help you. You can't do it without a woman, understand? - No need. - Why not? Well, if needed, I'll tell you. - Ah, fine. - How are you? Does it hurt? - A little bit yesterday night. - Right. Here's what, old man, I have a friend, although we haven't talked in a while, a medic general. He'd been gluing us soldiers together throughout the entire war. You won't count how many folks he brought back to the front. I will find him, and we'll visit him. - Can we not? - Don't run from it, we'll go. Listen, they're all beauties! - I see. - Good job! An acrobatic etude. By weaver Varya Ruzhintseva and the lunchlady of our administrative canteen Alevtina Gavrikova! A coquette. Wah! No! You won't see that in Ashtarak! How great that Volodya works in such a joyful place! And now a quartet will perform for you: Lyuba Gavrilova and Sonya Pugachyova - the weavers, Irina Valkina - the inspector, and Alla Vavilova - the cook. Singer - Vladimir Kondrikov! "For you! For you!" Hear that? I hear, vali-djan! It's so nice when your family member is treasured that much! You need to deserve that. Composer - Yan Frenkel, lyrics by Igor Shaferan. "For you!" Why are you worrying as if he's jumping without a parachute? He'll sing! Make people happy! I wonder if he drank a little? I like to sing when a drink a little. For you, for you, for you I want to become the best I'm ready to walk all world's paths I'm ready to cross all the seas Believe me, believe me, believe me. I will, with all my heart, Reach the stars, so I become the only one For you, for you, for you There will be joy Brighter than rainbows And soft Will become the winters How many Were beloved there, But I will Love you the most. For you, for you, for you I will make the world better I will gift you sunsets and dawns I will ask the birds to sing louder Believe me, believe me, believe me. I will, with all my heart, Reach the stars, to become the only one For you, for you, for you I will keep saying your name Forever, forever! I will listen, again and again To your words Love could only be eternal Only eternal, only eternal Otherwise why, otherwise why Should we wait for it? For you, for you, for you I want to become the best I'm ready to walk all world's paths I'm ready to cross all the seas Believe me, believe me, believe me. I will, with all my heart, Reach the stars, so I become the only one For you, for you, for you! Bravo! Good job, Volodya! That's it, Volodya! - I cannot tolerate it any longer! - Nune! Decide: your family or the factory! Nune, let's at least turn the shower off, you're all red. I'm not red from the shower, I'm red from suffering! Don't you dare turn the water off! - Don't let my father know of my shame! - Nune, did you study physics? It's us who can't hear him, but he hears us quite well. If he'd heard it, he'd kill you on the spot! Hear that! Kill! Calm down. What's wrong? Nune, please! Don't touch me! Heard me?! Ay, sister-djan? Oh, you're a fussy man, although funny. How can I let you in, kind man, - If you don't have a pass? - I don't! Say, sister-djan, do you have grandchildren? - Grandchildren? - Yes. I do, but you don't have a pass. Listen, what's a pass? I can get a pass, but I can't lose time. They're waiting for me, see. I came here for a week from Ashtarak for a reason. I walked my grandson Levon to school. For the first time! Grandad walked him! He will forever remember it! Forever! As if! Remember! Wah! No, sister-djan! Believe them! You believe them and they will believe you! Understand? People are already people! But if he didn't become a person as a child, he won't grow into one! No! Listen, how could I leave without finding out how my son-in-law works? Who works with him, what kind of people are they? Understand? You have kind eyes! I see you helped a lot of people in your life. Can you help me too, sister-djan? No, you won't? Hello, father! Hello, Volodya-djan. How did you get here? How beautiful! Did something happen? Sit down. Well? Volodya-djan, I'm very worried. For you and for my daughter. Very! Did you hear it yesterday? I've heard it and I see everything! Listen, you're the man of the house, Volodya-djan. What can I do? She filled her head with some nonsense. I love Nune. I don't need anyone else, no one! But she's driving herself mad, suffering. You are a wise man. Tell me something, advise. What to do? - Beat her. - Right. A little bit. - Nune? - Yes. - Father, are you insane?! - What? - Me, to beat up Nune, the mother of my son? - What happened? Almost a Doctor of Sciences?! Listen, who's talking about a doctor of sciences? I tell you: as a wife, a woman. For her own good. Understand, Volodya-djan? No, not angrily. Not strongly, a little bit! Just a little bit. I don't understand who she's taking after! Her mother was an angel! An angel, listen! We've spent 35 years in total harmony, let her rest in peace! I don't know, father. As if I know. Here we are. No, Volodya-djan, I'm afraid it will be too late soon. Think about it. Just think. No, why did I... It's been trying to come out for 30 years, let it continue for 30 more, as if troubles me! Listen, you! - Scared, soldier? - Me? If you are - say so, there's no shame in that! - No, I'm not a coward! - If you're not, then let's go. A coward, he says. Hurts. - Now turn on your back, pal. - One moment. Yes, I understand. Comrade general, what did your wife make the jam out of? - The jam? - Yes. - From apples. - Wah, apples! In Ashtarak we have nuts ripening right now. Quiet, dear. Alright, alright! Get dressed, petty officer. Huh. You've been stuffed well, petty officer. Even a good mistress won't stuff a goose that thoroughly. - That's nothing, comrade general. - Sure, it's nothing. Here's what. Let's cross the street. We have a little hospital there. Not the best looking, but it's equipped well. I provide consultations there occasionally. They have a great radiologist. I will be making shashlyk tomorrow. Shashlyk? If you want, my son-in-law can pick you up in a taxi. Ay, doctor-djan? We'll see. You won't find such shashlyk in Moscow. I've made my own basturma, I brought the eggplants and tomatoes from Ashtarak. You can get dressed. Well? Do I need to be cut open again, comrade general? No, petty officer. The shrapnel is small, it's already settled there. We don't need to touch it. See what I said! Wait for us there, please. Alright! It's bad scrap, right? It's not "scrap", my dear friend. Not this time. Although the shrapnel piece had set it off, probably. Most likely. It's worse. Much worse. Mikhail Ivanovich, how much does he have left, what do you think? Hard to say. Maybe four months. Maybe even less. Keep a close look, Levon-djan! Watch closely. You won't read about this in any book! No! We pass it down from father to son, from son to grandson. You will teach your children too. Understand? See how I'm putting these? Two like this, two like that. Two like this, two like that. Remembered it? I did, grandpa, I remembered it all. How could you not remember, if you come from Caucasus! A Caucasian! We'll light it up soon! Look! Now here. Ri-ight. Ah, good job! Oh how it burns! Good job! Come here! Come here, look! Ah listen, how hot it will be! They'll burn the house down! They will! Let me be struck where I stand, they will! I just don't know one thing: what should I do? Call the militia, or the firemen? Eh, gotta phone just in case. What if- - Militia! - Who lives there? Grandpa, are we going to put the meat on the sticks? Wah, oh no! No way! The meat part is only when the fire becomes gray on the coals. Understand? Now we take a badridjan. Look, I take the badridjan and cut it like this. Look. Here, here! Not to the end. Now we take lard. Where's the lard? Ah, here. We take the lard and put it here. Look. Here. Now we take salt and put it here. Oh, what's happening there! Are we on fire? Uncle Levon! Uncle Levon! Too much smoke! Wah, we're almost finished, Nina-djan! Come to us in an hour, to eat sashlyk and drink wine! All of you can come too, my dear neighbours! All of this is for you! Don't be cross at the smoke, listen! Shashlyk and smoke is like a hand and a heart! Ay, Nina! Grandpa? When are we grilling the meat? Wah! The meat is later! It's tomatoes now. Tomatoes! When we'll be putting them on, we'll do it bottom down. Understand? Their bottoms are thick, they won't burn. Wait! Wait! I couldn't sleep all night, I knew, I felt that nothing good will come out of that flat 49! What happened? Calm down, Anastasia. Oh, Mikhail Mikhaylovich, I didn't like this old man right away! I felt it! This is what being carefree results in, citizens! Ladder, now! We can't lose time. - Take your spots! Up! - Yes! Grandpa? There's a fire somewhere. Wah, these irresponsible people! Somebody forgot to turn the kettle off, perhaps. Why the hurry, listen? Turn the kettle off and then proceed with your business! Right, Levon-djan? Levon-djan, the tomatoes are almost ready! We take these off and put the meat on. Mister! What is going on here? We're making shashlyk with my grandson! Climb here, be our guest! - Dad! - Djana! - My daughter, Nune. - What is this? - What did you do? - What? Didn't we invite your supervisor Yevgeny Viktorovich? - Or did I dream this up? - But the people... - What do I explain to the people? - Wah, nothing needs explaining! They'll taste a piece of this shashlyk and understand it all! - Taste it where? - In our home! - Did you invite them? - Yes! All of them! What a smell! Hey son, why are you standing there? Listen, come here, I ask you! Thanks for the invitation, dad, I can't. - Why? - I'm on duty. Ay! Come here, come on! - I need to change first. - Good! - Good man! - Oh, I don't need this now! Yevgeny Viktorovich sitting next to a fireman with a helmet on! - What's wrong with you, daughter? - What? No, just who do you think you are? A countess?! Did you forget who helped you and your mother while I was at war? The people! The people! Yevgeny Viktorovich, it's really tasty! Have some! Wah, neighbour-djan, have some sauce! Listen, the sauce! What are you doing! Thank you. - What is a badridjan? - The "blues", as we say. Try it, try it. - Levon Pogosych! - Ay, djan? You should come to Moscow more often! Our institute could issue a working trip for you, as to an experimenter and a great master! I love you, professor-djan! I really do! - Do you know why I do? - I'm interested. Because you are a funny person! A funny teacher is a joy for his students! - Am I right? - Right! Eat, Nina-djan, eat. - Listen, court Nina! - I am! - Your health! - After your health, my dears! - Your health! - Kolya-djan, take some meat! It's soft! I made the basturma myself! I want to say one more toast. The last one! The last. - Why last? - The last! - We're having such a good time! - Speak, Levon Pogosych! Tomorrow, I leave to my Ashtarak. But my heart is calm. - You know why? - Why? Because my Volodya, my Nune, come here, vali-djan, my heart! My little Levon - they are staying with you. Yes, they have someone to come to with their sorrows and with their happiness. They have someone to ask if even for a glass of water. That's right, Levon Pogosych. - Yes, professor-djan! - I understand you very well, Levon Pogosych! I drink after the neighbours! Wah! This is a great word! Some people do not understand it. But that's alright! - After our friends and neighbours! - That's right! - After friends! - After neighbours! - Your health! - Thank you! After your health! Pour more. Wonderful wine! Pour it, Gena-djan. I'll do it myself while Gena is fumbling. My dears! Pour some. My dears, I want all of you with me to drink after my Russian friend here, who I have recently met. Yes, Kolya-djan. After my battle friend. Wait, wait. Listen, this is a person who went through it all, but did not lose himself! I don't know. I haven't seen many people who went through it all but kept their golden heart! Not many people! Kolya-djan, we had to meet, otherwise it would've been unjust. Although we've met a bit late. But that's alright. We've got it all ahead of us. Right? I leave tomorrow, but you will visit me later in spring. Right, Kolya-djan? After you, brother-djan. Nikolay Nikolayevich, after your health! - Be happy and healthy! - Live long! Although you know, Kolya-djan, to be honest, I like autumn more. - Why? - Oh, I know, I know. There are people who like spring more. Spring is happiness. Flowers bloom, grass grows. Autumn, spring - I don't care, just no fires, please. No, autumn is different. I like earth very much. So when you plant a tree in spring, water it with your own sweat, you then wait for what will happen in autumn. Because autumn means hope. Only in autumn can a person tell themselves who they really are. Autumn. - That's true. - A wise man. Let's drink after our beautiful autumn day, when we can look each other in the eyes like that and say: Hello! Hello, Levon Pogosych! Nikolay Nikolayevich, your health! After you! Do not be sad, my friend. Because you and I have planted trees. And when we will be no more, people will enjoy the shade of these trees. And they will remember you and me. It's good, good. Father, you could stay longer. Why are you in a hurry? No, Volodya-djan. I need to. Come to me in the summer, ay! Summer... Nune's thesis defence is in summer. My vacation is in November. You have to send Levon to me in the mountains. Hello. Hello. This is Stepan. - You must be mistaken. - No! Is this 284-41-31? - Yes. - Hello! - Hello! - I just wanted to say to uncle Levon, that everything is good in Bulgaria! - In Bulgaria? - Yes. Wait a minute. Alright! Father, Stepan from Bulgaria. Stepan? What Stepan? Wah! Wait! Wah! That's Stepan from Artashat, a golden guy! Ay, Stepan! Stepan, where are you? - Come visit us! - Hello, Levon-dai! I'm in Sheremetyevo! Flying back to Yerevan! Wah, that's a pity! Levon-dai, it's boarding time already! How was Bulgaria, Stepan? - Did they like our grapes? - They did, Levon-dai! Good man, Stepan-djan! Stepan! How nice, listen! Soil is the same everywhere. Attention, boarding continues to flight 898... Father. Father! So I make it to Ashtarak. And then what? You make it to Ashtarak and then ask for Levon Pogosyan, everyone will know! - That's it? - You should come too! - Thank you, I will! - Yevgeny Viktorovich! Wah, professor-djan! - Just in time! - Listen, why? You're such a busy man! Why? I had to see you off by all means! Thank you! I have here a little souvenir from the chemists. Treat your soil with it. Two spoons per a bucket of water. - And then what? - A surprise. You'll see in autumn. Good man! - Thank you, professor-djan! - You're welcome! - For you! - Thank you, Yevgeny Viktorovich! Oh that's nothing. You have a wonderful parent. To be honest, I've never felt as young as today. Well, I'll be waiting for you in spring, Kolya-djan. You know what I thought, maybe you should take the general with you? He's a very good man! Our man! We'll sit under a tree. Drink wine and remember. Yes, we know who and what to remember. That's right, Kolya-djan. Attention, boarding is ending on... - Won't you be late, father? - I'll be waiting. Repeat: boarding is ending on... Volodya-djan, just a little bit. I'm off. Be happy! Goodbye! - I'm off. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! - Have a good flight, Levon Pogosych! - Wait for me in spring, father! - We'll definitely come! Original subtitles: Volga English: spiritcc The End
