ALKHALLAT+ Turky! Where is my handpiece? - How would I know? - Have you seen it? - Why would it be here? Knock first. - Oh God! Mom! Please come here. Look. Isn't it a bit loose here? - No, honey. - You sure it's not loose? - Quickly. We have a long ride. - Perfume! - Never mind. - Quit trilling and hurry up! - Careful! - Don't worry. - Hurry up! - Be patient. It's not time for trilling. We have a long way to go. - My goodness! They're trilling! - It's okay. Let's go. Without a care in the world! And I have to drive 100 km now. - And why aren't you ready yet? - I... Almost. - Get a move on! - I want a drink. I'm thirsty. Let's go, Saud. Saud? Come on, hurry up. - Hey. - Hello. - Can someone help me? - May the next wedding be yours! Yeah... No. - Mother! - By God! - What's with you? - I need to go to the restroom. - Hurry up and get ready, quickly! - Okay. - Hurry and give them a shout. - Okay. Mother! Where are my pants? Shut the door! Let's go. We need to get going. Hurry up. - Yes? - Have you seen my pants? What pants? How would I know? - What have you lost? - My pants. Good grief! You're not even dressed? This house has no privacy. Good grief! - Hurry up! Enough with the trilling. - Mum! Mom, I can't find my handpiece. Come and help me. Even on my wedding day, nobody wants to understand. Mum, I found my pants. - I'm getting dressed. - Don't forget to tell the men. How is that my fault? Can't anyone stand in for me? Move it. Okay, fine. It's okay, Dad. Is it second-hand or new? You bastard! - Go! - Where's Faysal? He's coming. Come on, go! Stop! I said stop! You scumbag! Somebody, help! Come here! I will get you! Thief! Catch him! He's a thief! Faysal, give me your hand, quickly! You bastard! Stop. - Faysal, give me your hand, quickly. - Come here! - Stop the car and I'll get in. - Stop the car! - We can't stop. Come closer! - Help! - Come on! - No, do not slow down. Keep going. Step on it. Thieves! Over there! You sons of bitches! I see you. I saw your face, asshole! - Hey! What are you doing? - I'll show you! It's not for you, but for the guy behind you. Don't slow down. Keep going. Stop, you bastard! - Slow down! - Faster! Come here! I'll get to you. Give me your hand, Faysal. Oh God! We beat you! Step on it, Yehia. The gearbox is jammed. He's getting close. Hurry! - Where are you going? - Go! - He's close. Step on it. - Where are you going? Why are you looking at me? I'm sorry, man. I got you now! Come here, asshole! Don't move. I told you I'd get you. You made me run after you, bastard! Do you want to run? Don't move. - I have him. He's tied up and everything. - Go back inside. He's ready to be arrested. All good. Couldn't you come earlier? We have a long trip. And I'm attending to guests. Don't blame me. Yes. Okay, never mind. Never mind. I'll manage. Dad, don't stop in front of the door. Dad, not in front of the door. Move forward a little. WOMEN'S ENTRANCE - Enough. We're here already. - Let's go. - Dad, move forward. - We're guests and we're late! Get out. - Oh God! - Hurry. - Quickly. - Tell her to get out. - Come on. Please, move along. - Hurry up. Be patient. I'm the father of the bride, and here's the bride. Leave us alone. - Congratulations. - Go on. Let's go. Tie him to the seat and come. Don't you move, huh? I'm not going anywhere. Oh God! Goddamn him! I kept telling him to hold my hand. He slipped from my hand. I don't even know how. Give it a rest. You said that seven times already. Because I didn't push him. I'm just explaining it to you. What can we do now? The guy is done for. Poor guy, he doesn't have a family to look for him. He'll go to jail. And we... we should just go. What jail? If they interrogate him, he'll spill the beans. They'll have our names, and we'll be toast. Oh God! - May you live long! - How have you been? You are very late. We found our tires had been stolen. - The thief who stole them... - What! ...I beat and tied him up and brought him here until the police arrive. - And then? - Tell him the whole story. He went out to smoke and saw the thief. - No! - Yes. Allah help us, Abu Musleh. Kids these days... The tea is here. Abu Musleh, would you like some? - Do you have any basil? - No, but I'll get you some. Send for some basil for him. - Thank you. - I've become so old. - Long life to you, Abu Musleh. - Thank you. Okay. Now what do we do? You're the mastermind. Tell me what the plan is. Yeah. Mastermind. Basically, we need to split up. Split up? We're clueless together, let alone if we split up. Just for now. We need to cover all exits and entrances. There's only one entrance. Actually... That's right. Listen. For this first mission, I'll give you the leadership in this mission. So, I'm the leader you will follow? I command you to be the executive leader. Look. We need to blend in with the guests. But we don't look the part. Yes. I don't like our outfits either. No, you look fine. But I'll stand out. I'm not dressed like them. - Would you just follow the plan? - Shush! Okay, fine. - Stay here. - Fine, go. Don't be mean. Hello. Yeah. What are you wearing? You said we should blend in. I'm blending in with the coffee waiters. Hey, look at me. Blend in with this? It's lamé. - Shush. - You'll draw attention to yourself. And how do you think you look in that headscarf? I rented it from a guy outside for 50. You paid 50 riyals? I will take it out of your share... - Serve the coffee. Hurry up. - Yes. Sure. Come here. What? May it poison you! Idiot! Stop it, you brats! Enough! Thief! May Allah punish you, thief! Move away! Enough! Stop that. I swear your generation is rotten. With or without sugar? There is basil. I don't like it. No. There is basil. - Dad? - It's not me. - Dad! - Why do you... - Should I get you some coffee? - Dad! In the name of Allah. May Allah forgive me. Dad? Don't bother your father. Bless him, he... Why are you shaking? No reason. - In good health. - Dad! - Excuse me. - Please. Yes? What is it? There's basil. He has basil. Do you want it? You're interrupting my chat for that? I don't want it. - We have basil, sir. - Never mind. Go. - He doesn't want it? - No. - And you? - No, thank you. Bless you. - You want to sit down? - No You startled me, kid. Hey, kid... - Not funny. Not funny at all! - Hey! - Scared? - Not funny, kid! It's not scary. Shall I put it on you? - Not funny! No. Not funny. - So funny. Hush. Not a word. If you speak, I'll drop it. Not funny, kid. I said it's not funny. Did you see how we scared him? - Yeah. He looked so funny. - We really got him. Faysal. Come on. - What are you doing here? - Hurry up. Come on, quickly. Get out. You idiot! I would if I could. Can't you see? Come on, open the door. Open it before someone comes. No. Why not? Say sorry. - Are you serious? - Yes, I am. Say sorry. I'm sorry I called you an idiot. Open the door. That's the first apology. Another apology is due. What for? That day at the rest stop. What happened there? Forget it. You want me to discuss it now? Just apologize. Say sorry. Just two words, "sor"... "ry". Please proceed to the banquet. Go inside, please. Hurry up. Congratulations on their wedding, Abu Musleh. - Thank you. - Of course. Don't you want to bring "your guy" to have dinner with us? - The thief? - Yes. - Seriously? - Let's make fun of him a little. Consider it done. Turky. I'm sorry. Now open the door. Address me by name. This is not the time, you imp! Open the door! Okay, fine. Stay back. What are you doing? Put your hand through and open the door. - Fine. - My God! - Where are you going? - Sorry. Come. Untie the knot from the seat. Wait. Don't untie his hands. Just the seat. So, tell us, crook. Do you like how you've ended up now? Are people still stealing car tires? This one does. Been with us for six hours. - Good grief! - The smell of rubber is still on him. - You've fixed the tires, haven't you? - Yeah, almost. So, when you see a truck with six tires, you must find it very attractive! - Did you make him a plate? - Yes. Come on, but don't untie him. Eat with your hands tied. Come on, quickly. You know why? Because your hands would be chopped off. Chopped off! It's Shari'a law. Your hands would be gone. And then you'd only slither like snakes. According to my knowledge, they no longer... chop... chop the hands off. Are you his attorney or what? We know that! Go and do your job. And you, thief, why do you steal tires? And my tires! How did you know I'm an attorney? Is he? I went to law school. Honestly, you are wrong. We're wrong? This guy stole from us in plain sight! He stole our tires. How could we be wrong? He may have stolen your tires. It's a felony. He'll go to prison for a few years. And he'll be released. But you guys kidnapped him. Kidnapped him? We sat him in the front seat of my car. We took care of him. We're feeding him. How did we kidnap him? He has a family. So it's possible that they could sue you for compensation. For damages, psychological harm... He could die in your hands. Then it's, uh, man... slaughter. Correct. Abu Musleh, what do we do? I say we should untie him. Untie him, really? Yes, Dad. Let's untie him. Don't rush. Let's think a little. - Let's just untie him. - You're still consulting? We are not in the jungle! We have laws. It's a lost case. You become more guilty with every passing minute. Yeah. That's enough. Let's untie him. Untie him. - Untie him? - I'm just a messenger. All I did was convey the message. Thank you for the information, attorney. - We were not aware of this. - Dad. - What? - They're here. - Shortly, inshallah... - Let them come in. Let them in. - Abu Muhammad is here. - Abu Muhammad? It's good that he came before we started eating. Excuse me. I'll... Come here. Where are you going? If you move, I'll tell them you're my accomplice. He's coming. - Welcome, Abu Muhammad! - Congratulations. - Thank you. - I wish them all the best. Thank you. This is my son-in-law's father. - Congratulations. - Abu Muhammad. - Hello. - Abu Musleh, my new in-law. - Hello. - Long life to you. - Hello. Welcome! How are you? - Hello. Hope you're doing well. - Welcome. - Welcome. Nice to meet you. - Bless you. - Bless your days. - Where is he? - The one in pajamas. Hassan, let's go. You can't leave already. Don't move. - No... - I'll divorce Turky's mother. - I swear I'll divorce her... - Please... ...if you don't stay for dinner. - Fine. - I can't allow it. - You're most welcome. - Thank you. - Right on time. - Take a seat. - No. I... - Take a seat. - I'll stand guard. - Thank you. - Bless you. You're most welcome. - Mashallah. - May Allah bless our guests. - Blessed be it. - You honor us with your visit. - The honor is mine. The meat is lovely. It's all Abu Musleh's doing. It's some fine lamb. - Mashallah. Blessed be Allah. - It's the crème de la crème. - The meat is so tender. - Yes, indeed. And the color is light. You'd think it's a bird. You're too generous. You're letting the thief sit with us. Not just the thief, but his lawyer too. All of them together. Mashallah. You are a lawyer? - The thief's lawyer. - No. Who said that? - Water, please. - Sure. Didn't you just say you're a lawyer? No, I'm not... Pass me the tahini. I'm just like any other good citizen. Do you have an office? We're all good citizens. - Me... my late father... - May he rest in peace. He used to go... Your father was a lawyer? He used to check in at the court. I used to go with him... Do you have a degree, or is it a hobby? I... I know a little. - Where's your card? - I'm Saudi. Lawyer's card. You don't have one? - Lawyer license? You have a license? - Any regular lawyer license? Yeah... Inshallah. Yes. He said this is manslaughter and said something about kidnapping. - Who? You? - He said that. - The lawyer. - No. I'm just chatting over dinner. He's been babbling all evening, warning and scaring us. Just now, he said we'd be sued. He said with every minute that passes, we'll be taken to court for manslaughter. - No. Just a minute. - He said, "Untie him." He said we're criminals. - Yes. He said that. - Yes. - Every minute? - Yeah. - Yes, every minute counts against us. - No. He is the criminal. Anywhere in the world, he'd be punished. I hear you, and I agree with you. If only you could see into my heart, you'd only see love and respect for law and order. We all love our country. So, do you sympathize with him? - No! - Of course you do! - He told us to untie him, didn't he? - Yes, he did. - He said, "Untie him. This is kidnapping." - One moment! No. And that we're criminals. - He said all that? - He said manslaughter. And every moment that passes is against us. - He said, "Untie him..." - Yes. - We're criminals. - Yes. - He said kidnapping. Right? - Yes. - He said kidnapping. - Yes. He said manslaughter, and every moment that passes... Yes. Right? Only whipping works with the likes of him. That's not your job. Don't even touch him. Why do you think we're here? There's security and order here. You don't get to beat him. I... My parents are waiting. - Congratulations, man. - Thank you, man. - May Allah protect you. - Amen. May you bring wealth and she bring posterity. Many thanks. Welcome. Excuse me, but the picture wasn't... very good. Go ahead. A real pleasure being in your company. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Much obliged. Come. - All the best wishes to you. - Thank you. What are you doing? - Relax. I'm blending in with the groom. - Blending in? I found Faysal. - Then, let's go get him. Come on. - Too late. - They caught him. - You're such a... And you call yourself a mastermind? They have your friend. Step aside and follow my lead. I'll show you how it's done. Come and show me where he is. Where? The police are here. We may need to resort to a different technique. We need to go back to the car quickly. - Immediately. - I didn't get it. Explain. Part of the plan was to come here and see if the police are here... - Why are you... You scared? - No. I'm not scared. I'm not a kid. Just go to the car. Thank you. So generous of you, Abu Turky. Thank you so much. Wait. You can't leave before dessert. - No way. - That's so generous of you. Thank you. Stay here. You won't leave before dessert. Wait. Tell me, what's the plan? There's no plan! Now we escape. Escape! We go to the north of the city and... What a brilliant plan! We can't run away. He will snitch on us, and we'll be arrested. Oh God! I don't want to go to jail. I repent to you, Allah! Hey! Where's my headscarf? - Inside. - Where? I just bought it. Okay. Just add ten minutes. No, I can't wait, even for a second. - Okay... - Okay, kid, enough. - Go play! - I'm not talking to you. Shove off, you little imp! Go! I'll tell my mother. Tell your mother and father and the police! Get out of here! What? The police? Kid! Not the police, only your father! Hey, kid! Didn't you quit smoking long ago? No, I... There's been a misunderstanding. I mean... - What's the matter? - Over here. - I'm not sure. It's from the women's hall. - Hassan. Step aside, everybody. - Check the gates. - Make way. - Step aside, guys. Move. - Make way. I'm the groom's brother. Step aside, everybody. - Let somebody check... - Step aside. Calm down, everybody. I don't know how he got inside! - Who did? - Who? I was talking to my mother on the phone. He went in, and I didn't see him. Who is it? I don't know him! I swear, I don't know him! Hello, brother! Now, thank God, we can get you out. Eat shit, you bastard. - Guys! - Why'd you push me? - What did I push? - Why'd you push me? - Enough! - When did I push you? Can't you see all the sacrifices I've made for you? - It's not the time to... - And you! What's your deal? Why did you slap me? - You slapped him? - For your own good. - Not a word from you! - Can we calm down? Come here. I swear we came for you, you piece of shit! Not a word! - I'll deal with you later. - Why later, man? We were just waiting... Hey, you! Are you trying to run us over? I had to scold a child for your sake. I had to congratulate everybody, so we don't get exposed. We both sacrificed... Hey, wait. I scolded the child! Me and you... It was my plan! No! You always... like that... That's why I'm done with you. The two dumbest people I've ever met. - Go on, then. - Is that so? How ungrateful of you! Earlier, you were begging us to come to your aid. How childish! We saved you. Now say thank you. That's the least you could do. What a mess! All that chaos for a lizard? At least we caught it. Here, I caught him. He was... Come here. Do you have an arrest warrant? - What? - An arrest warrant. We have a warrant. Come. - Come here. - Me? - I serve coffee. - Is my name on the list? Come here. - If it's on the list... - I serve coffee and tea... - Oh yes. Coffee will be great. - Alright. - In the name of Allah. - But... - In a nutshell... - Unbelievable! Get in. Give me a cigarette. WHOEVER HAS A TRICK IN THEIR BAG, THEY CAN USE IT ALKHALLAT+ Exactly. The earliest available slot is April 7. Reservations are made two weeks in advance. Hend. Hend. How's it going with you? Everything is fine. Why are you worried? Okay. Thank you. Listen, which table is ours? Ask Muhannad. He knows. No worries. Everything will be to your liking. My name is Muhannad. I'm the restaurant's deputy manager. I don't care who you are. All I care about is my order. - Would you bring it? - I will check. - Go ahead. - At your service. - Muhannad. - Hey, Sara. - How are you? - No time for that. - Have you reserved a table? - What table? The one we agreed upon. I reserved it. - Don't worry. I have table nine for you. - Table nine? - I canceled the best table for you. - Wasn't it reserved? It was. But I got rid of them. I do what I can with the authority I have. But, please, Sara, they can't go over 2,000 riyals. We divide the tables among us. - It won't happen. They don't even... - Sara! - I think they're here. - They are? - Come on. - Anything you need for... Wonderful! Amazing! Wonderful! What a beautiful place! What is it? What do you want? - I'll take it from here. - Just five minutes. - Sara! - Dad, you can't park here. What a beautiful place! Who's your contractor? Did you call Mom? I did, and she's on the way with your uncle. Dad, please. Try to be nice to her today, and say nice things to her. - Hopefully she won't still be upset. - I said nice things to her for 20 years. She's obnoxious, and nothing ever satisfies her. Hopefully today she'll be satisfied. You see the staff member there? He'll take you to your table. - Give me the keys. - Can you drive stick? Yes, I can. Here you go. Wonderful! What a beautiful place! Who's the contractor? Amazing. Salamu Alaikum. Incredible! - Wow. - Hello. - Welcome. - Welcome. Come with me. - Family section? - Excuse me? - Family section? - Please, come with me. Salamu Alaikum. The table in the middle. - Hend? - Hey. - Did you see my father? - He's at table nine. - I can't see him. - Table nine, there. - What's wrong? - It's my mom. She can't see me. She'll know I set this up and not Dad. - What's her name? - Fawzeya. Greetings. Welcome. What name is the reservation under? I'm not sure. One minute, let me see if my husband has arrived. You're Mrs. Fawzeya, correct? - Yes. How did you know? - Your husband asked us to expect you. Please, come in. Table nine. - He asked you? - Certainly. Please. How come you don't have a family section? Honestly, sir, this is just how the restaurant works. Hopefully, it meets your satisfaction. At least a couple of partitions on both sides. - Where... - Salamu Alaikum. Welcome. Step aside. Most welcome! Have a seat. - Mashallah. - Sit. - I'll sit. - Spare me the theatrics. How are you? What a beautiful fragrance you're wearing! Is this the place you told me about? Yes. How do you like it? Look at this perfectly round table. So accurately cut. Mashallah! And the lamp changes color. - Oh Lord, give me patience! - Beautiful. Forget the lamp. How come we're sitting in public? Keep your voice down. Fancy places are like that. What do I know about fancy places? Since the day I married you, I never saw a place like this. How beautiful it is! What are you standing here for? I'm here to help you with your order. This is the menu. - Give it to her first. - Here you are. - Here you go. - Welcome. Do you have shish taouk here? Muhannad, how's it going? You'll get me in trouble with your parents. - I'm not comfortable at all. - Why? What happened? He wants shish taouk. We don't even have it. If I hadn't stopped him, he would have ordered the whole menu. Good evening, Muhannad. How's work today? Everything alright? Yes. Everything is fine. Welcome back. Thank you. - Thankfully, a busy day today! - Yeah. Muhannad. - Come here for a second. - Me? - Who else is called Muhannad here? - Right. Sure. Table nine. Have they arrived? What? You didn't hear me? Very important guests. They're the parents of the restaurant's owner. I'm talking to you! They... cancelled, today. Cancelled? - They cancelled because of a funeral. - A funeral? How come nobody told me? I cut my vacation because of them. Unbelievable! - Let me call him. - Table nine? They're here, Mr. Kareem. I just got their order from Muhannad. Are they here or not? Oh, table nine! Yes, they're here. Muhannad, my dear, please focus. It's a very important day. Focus! Now, I'll go check on them. Perhaps they need something. No need to do that. We already took their order. No, I must ask them again. No. No need, Mr. Kareem. You just arrived. You must be exhausted. Why are you meddling in this? And why are you here? Back to work. Go ahead, Miss Sara. Goodness gracious me. Why is he back? - Wasn't he on vacation? - Supposedly. And why'd you cancel the most important table? I didn't know they were. The reservation's in the owner's name. I was thinking of you, of your name, when I made the reservation. Why did you tell him they were here? I don't know. I had to do something. - Go and see what he wants. - No. Don't leave me alone. Muhannad, go! Alright. Stay here and... - Muhannad! - Okay, fine. No matter how many lamps I turn on, it's still dim. Only your presence brings light back into the house. Yeah, right. Don't you remember the old days... Welcome. I'm Kareem, the restaurant manager. - Can I be of any service? - Yes, please. Bring the order fast so we get this over with. - What beautiful decor! - With pleasure, madam. Excuse me, please! Where is this table from? And the table lamp? It changes its color. Well, it's all yours. Excuse me. I'll be right back. What's this food? It's too salty! I apologize. I will replace it for you. Welcome. Apologies. Welcome. Listen. Take this to my parents' table, quickly. This order is for table seven. I know. I'll get them another one. This dish is almost an hour late! Just let them eat it and go. - You will get us in trouble. - Just go. Mashallah! - Isn't that too much? - Bon appétit. At your service. What's this? Haven't we ordered grills? Right. Where's the shish taouk? Shish taouk, and grilled onions, they're all being prepared. Bless you. I'm sorry, I had something to attend to. Thankfully, the food is here. We hope you like it. Anything else, madam? Talk to me, please. What's wrong with you? Why don't you pull up a chair? - No, thank you very much. - Excuse me. I'll be back shortly. If you need anything... I'll go check on the grills. Welcome. - Who's the manager? - At your service. We ordered an hour ago. The food is not here yet. No problem. We'll get your order. Kindly remind me of your order? Sushi, sashimi, and spaghetti. They came after us, and they have their food already. Rest assured. Your order will be here. Please, have some patience, and your dessert is on the house. - No worries. - Welcome. Orange juice as you... - Muhannad. - Yes. Get me the bills of tables seven and nine immediately. - Is everything all right? - Let's hope so. But, sir, before we go, I need to tell you the truth... Later. - God help us! - Follow me with the bills. - What are you doing? - I want to eat. Your face will show. And so what? Every time you eat, you'll pull the niqab up? Don't eat! What's wrong? He wants the bills for tables seven and nine. - Seven and nine? - We are busted. - I need to confess. I can't even breathe. - Confess what? - Tell him Hend says the system is down. - What will you do? - Just go and tell him. - Oh God! Let me try that. - Which one? - The pasta. Pasta! What? You want to hold my hand with people all around us? - Aren't you ashamed? - They're all holding hands. I don't want you to touch my hand. Don't do it in front of others. We have a home, you know. It was a casual touch. Don't you understand? Don't come any closer! Shame on you. Anyway, thank you. You went to all this trouble. We haven't been to such a nice place for a long time. I mean... You deserve better, honestly. You know, if I didn't care about you, love and cherish you, I wouldn't have come. Honestly, our home without you is dark and sad. You're the mother of my children. You're my shining lantern. What do you say? Shall we go back home together? Hopefully, we could go back to how we were. Inshallah. Hopefully, all will be well, and we'll get back together. And you could go back to the old you. Abu Sara, whom I used to love, the one who would pamper me. Is everything alright? What did you just do? - Nothing at all! - You did! You winked! May your eyes pop out of your head! - I didn't wink! - I saw you! It could be the pepper. I saw you. Don't belittle me in public. - What are you saying? - Oh God! - Keep your voice down. - My God! - Should I pray for you to go blind? - It's the pepper. After I believed you and forgave you and said you'd be a different man... - Calm down! - Mom. - I want to try the rose. - Okay. I won't calm down. I'll stomp on my heart. I'll show you. My love for you, I'll crush it with my feet. Hello. This is a rose. The one you asked me to prepare for this very special day. In appreciation of love. It's a... rose... Yes. Indeed. A rose for my rose. You know what my problem is? It's that you know the way to my heart. How crass! A big cake with flaming sticks! Love is here. Yeah. Yeah, right. Happy birthday. May you live 100 years! No way it was cancelled, sir. Your parents are here and well. I was just with them. The food is served and they're very happy. It must be a misunderstanding. MUHAMMAD KHAMBOULY One moment, Mr. Saad. MUHAMMAD KHAMBOULY Yes, sir. I'm with you. It seems you are correct, sir. There has been a cancellation. Perhaps... Mr. Saad, believe me, it's not incompetence. We... Just give me a chance to... SARA KHAMBOULY How are you, Sara? Excuse me. I'm going to the kitchen. No. Stay here. I need you. - Their wedding anniversary? - Who do you mean? Either a wedding anniversary or the birthday of one of them. - I don't know. - But I have no problem with it. This happens often. What bothers me is... how could you cancel our most important reservation? You won't explain it, will you? Fine. I'll go and ask them myself. If they really are your parents, you'll watch security kicking them out. No, Mr. Kareem. Excuse me. I'm sorry. They are my parents. You see, they were getting divorced. So I thought of this idea to bring them together. As for the table, I really did not know. I swear. Otherwise, I wouldn't have made this mistake. This is the last thing I could do for them. I apologize. And have they made up? It doesn't look like it. My mom is stubborn, and my dad is even more stubborn. I don't think so. Listen. This evening is only missing one thing. Marriage is a collaboration. Couples fight a lot. One day, they fight. One day, they make up. But they always agree on one thing. Their child. Which means you. You need to sit with them at the table. Go get changed and sit with them. Take the rest of the night off. Really, Mr. Kareem? I can go? Thank you. Don't thank me now. Fix the problem first and thank me later. Come here! Where are you going? Get changed first! Okay, thank you. What are you looking at? Keep your eyes on your food. Salamu Alaikum. Alaikum Assalam. What are you doing here? Dad called me and wanted us to sit together. We haven't been together for a while. But I was held up in traffic. - Right, Dad? - Yes. That's right. You haven't missed much. How are you two? We are fine. Go ahead. Start eating. - We are back on good terms. - Continue pampering me! - Dad? - Yes? You guys go. I'll follow you shortly. - Alright. - Take the keys. I understand that today I was way out of line. Yet you helped me, so... I'd like to thank you from my heart. No, not at all. That's our duty. Could you fetch that piece of paper from the printer? Yes, of course. Honestly, I'll always be indebted to you. And hopefully I can repay you, even a little. No, not at all. As I said, this is our duty. We are one big family here. This brings us joy. Could you please sign here? Thank you, Mr. Kareem. Of course. Here you go. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT This is not a charity. This is a respectable restaurant. Our guests are decent people. Our staff should also be decent. See where she parked it? How inconsiderate! Right by the curb. It's okay. So far away. You're getting old. - As for me... - I'm not old yet. - Over here. - I'm still young. Goodness gracious, cover your legs! Jealous? Get in. Wait. Wait. - Get in. - Some fancy moves! I learned romance very well. How very awesome! Awesome! May Allah keep you safe. You too. And may we never part. Say amen. Amen. EXIT I want to tell you something, but I'm worried you may get upset. I've finally won your favor. How could I be upset? The food was disappointing, and I'm not even full. Didn't you see how I finished the pasta plate in one bite? - Shall we go to our restaurant? - Abu Safady? - Yes. - Salamu Alaikum. - Alaikum Assalam. - Alaikum Assalam. So? Abu Safady. Are you in? Yes. I'm in. Their falafel is as big as my kidney. - The rose. - You forgot this. - Here. Wear it. - I forgot about it. I want to shred it on my falafel and my kidney. Give me my rose. Let's go. Guys, bring him some water! Don't worry. All will be fine. Dear God. Open the door... We belong to Allah, and to Allah we all return. May Allah be in your aid, my girl. May Allah bless his soul. May Allah forgive him, pardon him, be merciful on him, and grant him peace. Praise be to Allah, lord of all creation. - Sir! - What? - May Allah reward you. - Yes. - Me and you both. - Hold on. Excuse me, please... Please! Only relatives. I was with him in the accident. Excuse me, sir! Salamu Alaikum. Alaikum Assalam. May Allah reward you. - Me and you both. I'm glad you are okay. - Thank you. Thank you. My condolences, Reem. - Praised be Allah, lord of all creation. - May Allah reward you. I don't know how it happened. It was Allah's decree. He uttered the Shahada, and I stayed with him until the ambulance arrived. May Allah have mercy on him and pardon him. We may not object to his will. We may not object. Allah foreordains and he does what he wills. May Allah forgive him and admit him to his paradise. He was a good husband. He never failed me. He was loyal and honest. NOOR He never kept secrets from me. May Allah forgive him. He was an exemplary husband. He spread smiles. Everyone loved him. Wherever he went, he was loved. He left nothing but good memories. NOOR He was loyal and honest. I was the only woman he knew. - How will I live without him? - May he rest in peace! May he rest in peace! I don't know how I'll live without him, my childhood friend. How will I live without you, Fahd? May Allah pardon him. Doctor, where are his belongings? With his wife. I have them here. Oh, you have them. But, Reem, Fahd had entrusted me with something. - What is it? - It's all good things. You were the last one with him. What did he say? It's all good things. Just let me take them and return them. - But tell me! - Later. Now is not the time. What do you want to do with them? Trust me, Reem. Now is not the time to explain. - But you'll return them to me. - Inshallah. Come on, my child. Honoring the dead is by burying them. Let's get going. Praised be Allah, lord of all creation. Praised be Allah, lord of all creation. From Allah we came and to Allah we shall return. May he rest in peace. He who has created death and life, that he may test you as to which of you is best in deeds. And he is the Almighty. NOOR Who created the seven heavens one above another. No want of proportion... NOOR ...who created the seven heavens one above another. NOOR No want of proportion wilt thou see in the creation of Allah, Most Gracious. Then look again and yet again, your sight will... Aren't you going to pick up? Aren't you going to pick up? No, later. Now is not a good time. I can talk. Give me the phone. No. I know this guy. The laundry guy. I will call him back later. - It's better if we answer. - It's all like a bad dream. I still cannot fathom it. May Allah rest his soul. - May Allah forgive him... - May Allah forgive and pardon him. May Allah forgive him and bless him with his mercy. - Salamu Alaikum. - Alaikum Assalam. Do you have a charger? This one sometimes works, and sometimes it doesn't. - Would you like me to try? - No need. Thank you. May Allah forgive him. Oh God, requite him with an abode more excellent than his abode, with a family better than his family, and with a spouse better than his spouse, and forgive him and have mercy on him. ME: WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING. REEM: WHAT IS IT? ME: I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I GET HOME. - May Allah forgive him. - May Allah reward you. It's Allah's decree. Bless you. Pray for him. Hey, Saad. Amen. May Allah pardon him. It's Allah's decree. Praised be Allah. May he be forgiven. Okay. I'll send you a nearby location. We will pray Isha for him, inshallah. Amen. Listen, I need to ask you, if an iPhone is locked but I don't have the passcode, is there a way to unlock it? No way to unlock it without the passcode? So, if I format it, everything on it will be deleted and it will turn on. Good. Bring me that needle to open the sim card compartment. I'll explain later. Just bring it. Mrs. Reem? - Who? - Are you Reem? - Who is it? - I'm Hamad. Hi, Hamad. - Are you alright? - Everything is fine. - Do you need anything? - We are fine. Sure? Do you need water? Anything? No, thank you. By the way, do you know the passcode of the phone of the deceased? - What? - The passcode of Fahd's phone. Why? Because, as I told you, he entrusted me with a task. What task? Nothing to worry about. These things are better left undiscussed. - Are you done with the phone? - So, you don't know the passcode? No, I don't. May Allah ease your pain and ours over this loss. Listen. Where's the phone? I need it. I'm almost... done. Yes? - Hamad? - Yes... Just a sec... coming. Hamad? Hamad? - May Allah reward you. - May God console you. - May he be pardoned. - Amen. - To paradise. - Amen. May Allah bless your effort. - May God console you. - May Allah reward you. ENTRY FORBIDDEN FOR WOMEN May Allah forgive me. FAHD: ONLINE SAIF: MAY ALLAH FORGIVE HIM. FAHD: ONLINE SAIF: MAY ALLAH FORGIVE HIM. Oh my God! Hamad. May Allah reward you and bless your effort. May Allah reward you. May Allah forgive him. TAREK - ABDUL MUHSEN OSAMA - SAIF - FAHD FAHD ONLINE NOW Oh God. God bless the prophet. - Salamu Alaikum. - Alaikum Assalam. - In the name of Allah. Come help me. - Yes. - Let's get started. - In the name of Allah. It's where we all eventually end up. Praised be Allah. Praised be Allah. May Allah forgive him. How odd! How did the glasses get here? - Take them with his belongings. - Yes, one second. One minute. Just a moment. Reem? - Reem? - Who is it? Hamad. Give me the phone. I don't have the phone. Yes, you have it. I need it for five minutes. I don't have it. Wasn't it with you? - The deceased is online! - What are you saying? Please, just give me the phone for five minutes. He entrusted me with a charitable deed that I need to handle for his sake. - What did he entrust you with? - Just some charity. Just for five minutes. I don't have the phone. The deceased is chatting on Snapchat. - I don't have it! - You have it. Give it to me for five minutes. Reem, give me the phone. Reem? Reem? NOOR Reem? May Allah forgive you! Reem? Reem? NOOR CALLING FAHD Hey, you! Yes. - Yes? - I need your van key to charge my phone. - I told you it doesn't work properly. - Don't worry, I'll manage. Thank you. Hey! You can't turn the ignition on. Just turn the switch on. Hey! The van! Hey! The van! Hey, man! The van! Give back the van! Hey! The van! Move! Get in. Damn it! FAHD Turn to green! FAHD Noor! Noor? Hold on! Who is it? Hamad. By God, what happened to you? Is this your van? I'll explain later. Did Fahd call you? He did. But I didn't answer. He normally calls me on Snap, so I got suspicious. You didn't answer any call or message? You deleted all the conversations? I didn't answer. What's the matter? Where's Fahd? Good. Don't answer anything. His wife has his phone. What if she calls me from a different number? I don't know. Turn it off or... change your number. Everyone has this number. What's happening? Where is he? This is not the time. Please. Just listen to me now. He's calling. His wife is calling. Yes. Why are you calling? I finish clothes and call you. Bye! - I fixed it. - Fixed what? What is happening? Listen, don't pick up at all. There's something you need to know. She's calling again. No more calls! Don't call! Clothes not ready. DEATH You annoy me! No call! Busy! Clothes not ready! What? No call me! Enou... NOOR Reem! You had the phone all along! I've been looking for it. May Allah guide you. I've been looking. May Allah forgive him. He needs our prayers. We all need prayers. The prayer is for two men and one woman. Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. Praised be Allah. So unfortunate! His friend who was with him only fractured his arm. The shock was too much for him. He died right after him. - Unbelievable! - That's life. May Allah forgive them. Amen. Should we go to the burial? We can't. We paid our respects. May his soul rest in peace. We have a flight to catch. May Allah forgive them. Are you sure that this is the hotel? Yes. I'm sure of it. What's wrong with you? - And what's that? - Perhaps this is a wedding reception. What a coincidence! Is it an excuse to be scantily dressed? Let people be. Don't give me a headache. I had a weird feeling about this trip. You should encourage us to go say hello instead! Oh, say hello, then? That's what you want! I'm joking with you, Um Saud. Are you jealous? - Get a move on. - Let's go. Good evening. Three nights, compliments of Saad Construction Company, reserved for a Mr. Khaled Al Hanuni, including breakfast for only two people. Room 603. Yes, only two people. Um Saud and I came here on vacation. And the kids are at home. - Okay. Bless them. - Okay... As for the key cards, we need three of them. I'm sorry, sir. Hotel policy allows only as many keys as the guests. Okay. I would like you to maybe give us an extra one as a gift. No problem, sir. I'll issue a third card key for you. I'm sorry. So? Should we go out? Go for dinner or to the mall or anything? Go to sleep. I'll show you a good restaurant later. Dad, we didn't come here to sleep. Please. Nothing is open now. In this city, everything shuts down at 8:00 p.m. Dad, that's back in the village, not here. Will you quit nagging, or do I need to smack you? Sleep! We just arrived after a long flight. We flew at 6,000 feet, and you want us to go out? But... I'm hungry. I want to eat something. Didn't you eat on the plane? You ate your sister's sandwich, then your mom's, then half of mine! I'm hungry again now. You're just spoiled! If you want to eat, eat some toast or something. Tomorrow, the buffet will be open. We paid a lot for that. Dad, breakfast is complimentary with the room. - And who paid for the room? - It's also complimentary. You insist on upsetting me before bed. Remember, if you don't listen to your father, you don't succeed. I don't want the neighbors to hear, or else you'd have suffered. Quit it already. By God. - Unbelievable! - You ruin it. Enjoy what you have. We came all the way here. - Mom? - Listen to your father, and spare us tonight. Go to sleep. If you are so hungry, there's a wedding downstairs. - Where? - A wedding reception. Pretend to be a guest and have dinner there. Find a way. No. Who told you it was a wedding hall? That's a disco... Goddamn you! Go to sleep, now! Boy! What's wrong with you? Shut up or I swear... I'll throw you off the balcony. If it's not a wedding hall, then what is it? A wedding hall. Never mind this idiot! Yes. Correct. A wedding hall. Go to sleep now. I swear if you even step outside, I'll break your legs. I'm very serious about this. - Dead serious! - Don't you worry. Generation of losers. God help me... Grumpy? I'm starting my first medical trip and wanted to share it with you. Share the views and the goals. - Captain... - Please, step back. - A photo with the captain. - Please. - Captain Abdullah is busy. - Just a photo, cap... - Please, step back. - Captain, a photo with you. - Step back. - I flew from Riyadh just to take a photo. - He's busy. - Leave him. It'll take a second. - Captain, your company is waiting... - I'll be quick. - It will be quick. - Captain. - Yeah. Welcome. - You are the best player in all of Asia. Thank you. No, please. All of Asia will see... Ladies. Move. - Oh yes. This way. - Right. Here you go. Come on. DAD One minute. Captain, your goal against Japan. You shot it like a rifle at the bar! You know what? At that moment, we were either in or out. Almost done. Come on. Captain Abdullah, everybody is waiting upstairs. DAD Captain, remember when the coach pulled you out? I remember all the moments every day. - And all the goals. - The iconic comeback! I remember all my goals. Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Take the picture. Okay. I will. - Come on. - Let's go! - Captain Abdullah! Listen, please! - Abdullah Booz! - Abdullah Booz! - Abdullah Booz! Abdullah Booz! Here we are. Awesome! Captain Abdullah? - Captain? - Come here. Come. Tonight we party. Hey! You again? What do you want now? I was pushed in with you by mistake. What's he doing here? - Your muscular friend. - Okay. What do you want? - Just a picture. - No pictures. Take your phone. Take it now. Put it in your pocket. - You want a picture? - Yeah. Let me enjoy now. Photos later. We'll take a million photos here. DAD Can you hear me? Louder! That asshole! Unbelievable! How old did you say the boy was? He's 20, 19, around that age. Okay, sir. One second. Wait a minute. You checked in only with your wife. No kids. Yes. Twenty years with my wife, no kids. Well, you know... It's customary... We refer to my wife's nieces and nephews as our kids. In that case, sir, this is a violation of hotel policy. Couldn't you just... Sorry, sir. What is it with you? You make everything so difficult. You keep saying policy and stuff... This is the hotel policy that we abide by. - Is that your final say? - Yes, sir. Please, sir. Could you read the services, please? They're all in the brochure, sir. I can't read... English. You have it in both Arabic and English. You can take a look at our services. Your font is too small. Okay, sir. I'll read them out to you. This is at 11:15, the moment you arrived at reception. Go, forward. Okay, sir, I'll go. Fast forward a little. Go. Stop. That is him. Looks like him. Can't you rotate the camera to see him from the front? No, sir. This area only has one camera. And what is that area? It's the club, sir. - The what? - The hotel's club. Okay, go inside with him. Sir, we only have this camera. Bless you. You didn't show us... You see him clearly. Is this your son or not? No. Not him. I can't see his face. This is not clear. - Thank you. Salamu Alaikum. - Sir! The brochure, sir! What do you want? The brochure in Arabic and English, in small font, and you asked me to read out the services. Just a moment ago. - You mean the money? - No, sir. What money? The brochure. - You mean the money. - Sir... Have a nice day. - You want the brochure? There it is. - Yes. Unbelievable! Good evening. Hello, sir. Reservation, please? I'm a guest in the hotel. Room reservations don't include this area. I'll just take a look at the place. If I like it, I will reserve. Sorry. Besides, you're not following our dress code. - The what? - Your clothes and shoes. My clothes and shoes are high class. Everyone who sees me is in awe. No, sir. They're not appropriate for this place. This is our policy. Policy? I know all about the policy. I learned it from your friend upstairs. I know what to do. Fifty? Then we reconsider the policy? This is a respectable place. Get changed, make a reservation, and you can get in. Unbelievable! I'm telling you... How much? 50? 100? 200? I'll give it to you. Yes, tell him, sister. Tell him my clothes are fine and all. Okay. We can overlook the dress code if you pay for the table. No problem. I can pay. How much? 100? 200? 300? No problem. 1,500. 1,500 for a table? But the places next door charge less than that. Why are your prices so high? - Prices start from 1,500. - And is that logical? And I... This doesn't make sense. You either pay, or you don't get in. - You'll lose a customer. - Go ahead. Okay. I mean... For 1,500, what do we get to do inside? What does it include? - Could I... do whatever... - A table. What? A cold drink. Shani. Orange, squeezed in the blender. Yes. What is this? This is for me? No! I said no alcohol! Who's that? Who? Goddamn you! Go. - Welcome! - Welcome, Abu Saud! How good it is to see you! Hello, Abu Turky. Welcome. - Bless you. - Welcome, Abu Turky. - Hello, Abu Saud. - Greetings to you. Bless you. You don't know him? I do feel I have seen him before somewhere. How would he remember me? He's too busy partying. This is our friend from Sharkeya, from two days ago? - Oh yeah! - Yeah! - The troublemaker! - Sit. Fill up your drink. - Welcome! - Bless you. Welcome. Bless you. So, you've been drinking! No, I swear. I don't drink it. I don't eat it. - You don't? Yeah, right! - I swear. Did you see his face when we sent him drinks? Yes. I saw the whole thing. You didn't have to. Thank you. Returning your generosity. Just a modest gift. You know what? The night is young. Come on. God willing, we'll get you into the groove here. No need to cost yourselves more. What a rapturous sound! Calm down, guys. - What's this? - It's Kambodi. - Saluti! - Drink up! Cheers, man. - Here we go! - Come on, brother! No need to do that. You'll break the glasses. Drink, brother. Drink, Abu Saud. Where are you, bro? Keep chasing us all night long, brother. Never mind. I'm in a good mood already. No need to drink. Come on, drink. I know this song. - Yeah. - American. Western. My goodness me! Yay! Drink up! That's it! Yeah! - Good. - How fun! - Such fun! - He will get sick! - Very good! - I'll send you a medical swab. Very good, guys... Yes, man. I love you, Abu Saud. Bless you, my dear. No problem. You're here, and I... What are you doing? I'm fine. It seems you don't like this DJ. Ahmad? Call the DJ and tell him to play Iraqi music. It seems he likes to dance to sad songs. - Or you don't like sad songs? - I want to go to the toilet. And you'll leave me alone? Just listen. How could you - I'll go to the toilet. - Do that to someone who loved you It's not a sin to love me Come. Get a move on. Come on! Come here. Go to the toilet later, man. What do you want? WHERE ARE YOU BOTH? HELLO? Let me pour you some of this so the trip to the toilet is worth it. Look at that guy. He must have snuck in. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? There's a guy with a phone videotaping you. - Are you serious? - That table. - Damn it! - Hey! It is not permitted to film here. I see your flash. I'll show him! Move! That damn guy who's filming! I'll show him! You think you can film the VIP table as you please? - What? - We are here to party and have fun. No one takes out their phone and films. - Check what this man is saying. - What's wrong? - I saw a phone filming me upstairs. - No one filmed you. Abu Turky. Get up! Did you film this man? - He says you filmed him. - I saw the phone high in the air. We're all high in the air, not just the phone. Watch your tongue. And whoever filmed me, give me your phone. - I did. What are you going to do? - Give me your phone. - What would you... - No! - Get out! - No! - I said get out! - No! Out with the phone. - This is my brother! - Give me your phone. Security! He might be here or there. - Where is he? - Maybe here. Where is he? - I don't know. He must be somewhere. - Here? Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah. All good. Listen. An old man over there is acting crazy. - Where? - Wearing a hat, over there. - There? - Yes. Straight ahead. Damn you and the one who got you in this fix. One moment. What are you doing? I didn't record anything. The other man did it. One moment. Stay right there. Do you want anything or... Don't test me, please. You want to follow the hotel policy? Do you want money? I'm sorry. Excuse me. Saud? Saud? Boy? Come out, my dear. I won't say anything. Come out. Come out. Come out, you brat! Come out. You think I didn't notice your blackened mouth? Your mouth shows you were smoking and... Hurry up! Get out! Open up. I said open the door. Open the door or I'll smash it on your head. Open the door. Open or I'll come in. I'm coming in. Open up, Saud. Open. Open up, Saud! Open up, Saud! I said leave me. No! Saud! Help your father, Saud! Saud! Boy! EXIT Hurry. They'll catch us. That guy was choking me! Never mind. I smashed him on the head. - Good timing. Yes, I saw you. - He is not moving. Well done, Saud. - But... - Yes. Dad, I came in here by mistake. I swear. What have you learned? These places are not for you. - I swear. - I'm proud of you, son! May Allah protect you, my son. You're your father's son, - Yes. - not how your mom raised you. - By mistake. - Otherwise, you'll be spoiled. What did I say? You were awesome though. I'll fight anyone who lays a hand on you. Well done. Your dad was the toughest boy in the street. I swear. Thanks. - Mom! - Come. What's going on here? Is it a wedding or a party or what? - This is a nightclub. - What's that? - A discotheque. Yes. - Discotheque? It's your mother. - Your mother. - Are you sure it's her? It's your mom. You brought this scandal on us! - My God! - Relax. It's a simple matter. - It's your fault! - What does that have to do with me? How so? Will you disobey me? I'm your father. - I didn't disobey you. Heaven forbid! - Shut your mouth! You piece of trash! Who was standing upstairs? Laughing and drinking... All the bottles... Your cackling can be heard from down the street! I also saw you sitting there with the drinks and the girls and the party and everything. - What party? - Downstairs, over there. It was... Abu Turky's fault. He tempted me. He came with that bad man. Tell me now, how are we going to tell your mom? Why is that my problem? I didn't bring you here, Dad. Not your problem? You lie to me? Your father? I didn't lie. I just came to take a photo with... Right away, you'll come with me and tell her that you brought us here. And you'll tell her it's all your fault. No, sorry. I won't take all the blame. You will take the blame whether you like it or not. And I have proof. Where is it? So? Who is that? My spoiled kid! With all the bad seeds. We haven't seen them before. We don't know them. No one we know behaved like this ever. Dad, I have a plan. - A plan? - A plan for Mom. Come on. So? And who is this? Isn't it you? Dancing, with girls and bottles and stuff. Hey, what's the matter? You filmed this, right? You filmed this. Delete it immediately. - Wait. Be patient. - Don't get closer. Don't get closer or he will click the share button and a scandal will be on the way to you. It's okay. Captain Abdullah, I really love and admire you, but... We have a problem... I mean we have demands. Demands? What do you want? And you must delete it. First demand... 2,500. 1,500 for the table, and 1,000 for the hotel policy. Second, you must repent to Allah for this shame. No, we just lost the championship, and I need to change my mood, because... I'll quit it. I'll stop it. Dad, it's not the time to repent. Captain Abdullah, sorry... We have a... we have a demand. The photo, right? Take off your clothes. Yes. Take them off. You and your companion. That there is... I knew it! - You're really wicked! - You see how? What if I move my queen like this? - See how your father plays... - I took one of your pieces. - Where? Which move? - The queen. Why didn't you answer my calls? We're here. Where have you been? I went... I felt upset for Saud because I scolded him earlier. So I took him to eat at the restaurant. - Where were we? The bishop. - Yeah. How does it move? Diagonally. Diagonally like this. There's a move that can make you win, however... - Did you figure it out? - Mom. I want a stamp on my arm too. - I swear, he took me there! - I swear to you, Mom. - I've got nothing to do with this. - Shut up! - I swear I met him inside. - He took me there! I swear to you, Mom. I didn't go inside willingly. They carried me inside.
