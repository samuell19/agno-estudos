[thunder] [Dark Music] [Camera Clicking] [Dark Music] [Duduk Music] [Music Swells] [emotional exhale] Happy Birthday to you! You live in a shoe! But that's not so bad... 'cause it's a Jimmy Choo. [giggles] Show me your coin. Ta-da. "We rarely see someone fail..." "...who has thoroughly followed our path." That'd look good next to yours. You keep it. You've earned it. And, happy second birthday to you. Sounds like something out of Alice in Wonderland. The day you were born, and the day you got clean. Here's to the newborn. Cheers! It's gonna be a hell of a year. Fuck, yeah. I love you, baby. Aww. Okay... Make a wish. [blows out candle] [violin music] [moans, groans] [ominous violin] [muffled necklace clinking] MASSIMO: So it's just this head? TIEN: Of a woman, yeah. MASSIMO: And the guts hang out? While it's floating in the air. That's gross. That's gross. Uh, what about your fairy tales? TIEN: The dude-bros, forcing themselves on princesses while they sleep. No, I mean... [awkward laugh] I've never heard of it... the, uh... MASSIMO: Penanggalan. Is that how you say it? [computer keys typing] Or Arp. That's... what my Ba used to call it. Your grandma? Yeah, my grandma. That woman was obsessed with my virginity for some reason, you know? Sure. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, she wanted me to be a doctor. Or someone who builds shit. I dunno. Something like that. So she told you about this vampire thing? Yeah, I mean it was it was like a vampire. See, I was supposed to be pure so she told me all these disgusting stories to scare me. I was only 10 years old. So, basically, they're abstinence PSAs. Gotcha. Just because I wanted to be an actor. So, she thought you were, uh... A slut. Bad girl. "Don't be a slut..." "...Or the floating head will come eat your baby." "Suck your fetus right outta ya!" So, so gross. Oh, my grandma. She loved talking about fetus cannibalism. You still had sex, though? Of course. All the time. Yeah, but that's not the point. Tell me about your mom. She fuck you up with fairy tales too? Nah... My mom never told me stuff like that. Oh... so... She went for the good-old warm and fuzzies. The Old Man Who Sees You When You're Sleeping. MASSIMO: Yeah, right. Oh, no. Or the capitalist propaganda... THROW-UP A BODY PART! PUT IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW! GET SOME MONEY! Or, the, umm... the Giant Mutant Bunny, Who Profiteers Off Of Eggs. The classics! Mm-hmm. [giggles] Oh, my god! We're talking about my mom! Well, that's when you know you've made it. Where? To Freud's couch? Ah! Freud's full of shit. [...] So what did you mean? "I made it"...? A real... Relationship. [...] I dunno. My mom was just... Mom. That was scary enough. You make her sound like a Succubus. She was. Couldn't be all that bad. Oh, just wait till you meet her... [!!!] [cutting] [knife sounds] BARBARA: Chocolate is Massimo's favorite. Oh, I know. He's quite the Chocoholic. [Beethoven violin music] TIEN: I bet she was a badass. MASSIMO: Things were better before Dad left. Did she ever call the cops? They didn't do much. Figured he went down to Mexico. Mom said he was into a lot of nasty shit with a lot of nasty people. Drugs? Drugs. Money. I dunno. He just fell off the face of the Earth. I'm sorry. Yeah, but... Crate's been good to her. Oh, yeah. Your Stepdad. Zeb Crate. [Beethoven violin music] CRATE: Vino? Oh, no. Thanks. Uh, she doesn't drink. [glass clink] [wine pouring] [Beethoven violin music] Crate knew my Dad. MASSIMO: Helped set me up. Odd jobs, here and there. [gulp] CRATE: You live around here? Uh, no. She's got a place in the Valley. So... you two aren't, uh...? No! No, we're not living together. TIEN: Well... not yet. [Beethoven violin music] [Beethoven violin music] [wine slurp] Um... Zeb's a real Chocoholic too. Mm-hmm. Goddamn right. Love me some Chocolate. And you're an... Alcoholic... Right? [cutlery clinks] BARBARA: Zeb... Oh, that's okay. That was a long, long... really long time ago. That's why I have this. [necklace clink] [fabric rustle] [Beethoven violin music] Oh, well... Good for you, honey. What do you do? [nervous laugh] I'm a bartender. CRATE: Really? MASSIMO: Uh, over in Beverly Hills. Sounds risky. Are you fucking kidding me...? TIEN: Shh... [whisper] Massimo... Did I say... Anything? BARBARA: He meant that as a compliment. [wine pouring] CRATE: So you know a little bit about this? TIEN: Oh, yes. That's Chorazos. Uh, that's a pretty swanky... ...pinot noir you have. Goddamn right, it is. Well, we love it. It's from the Carpathians. Where? Transylvania. MASSIMO: Oh, where the vampires live. Something like that. [like a vampire] I never drink... alone. Okay, Dad jokes. [loud giggling] [Beethoven violin music] [loud wine slurping] [Beethoven violin music] [record ends] [whoosh] [flute music] TIEN: I'm sorry. I've got to split. Thanks for coming by, babe. Nice to meet you both. Call you tomorrow? Sounds good. [kiss] [door opening] [footsteps] [door slams shut] MASSIMO: So...? What did you think? Um... she's... Nice, right? She's very... CRATE: What'd you say she does again? I don't think I did say. So what does she do? Yes, honey. What was it again? She's a bartender, mom. BARBARA: Oh, that's right. So, she ever consider doing anything else? Like a... BARBARA: That's very brave. CRATE: ...career... Or a...? Real job? Well, the pay's pretty good. She's an actress, and... she's amazing. She's gonna be a big star Is that so? MASSIMO: Yeah, that's so. BARBARA: That's nice. It's not like she works in a dive bar downtown. She works in Beverly Hills. Well, what about? What about me? Maybe she can get you a job. MASSIMO: A job? He's got a job! I just thought he could... Could what?! Don't talk to her like that! It's okay honey, um... So you want me to hear him out? CRATE: Yes. You need to hear me out. Just listen to your father. Jesus Christ, he's not my father. Aw, honey... I just... I've already heard it, mom. All of it. That's not what this is about. BARBARA: Course not. No one is saying... I'm not with Tien for a job. Did we say that?! BARBARA: No, we didn't. CRATE: Did we say anything even remotely close to that? BARBARA: Honey, we just want what's best for you. [anxious music cue] CRATE: "Tien"... "Tien"... That's, uh, Chinese? MASSIMO: Vietnamese. So she's got like a... work visa, or something? She was born here. That's nice. Her parents live here? Yes, mom. They were born here. I meant, do they live in California. CRATE: You know, your uncle was in Vietnam. What? What uncle? His brother, honey. CRATE: They tortured the shit out of him in a camp. What is this? Jesus Christ, what is this shit?! Hey, watch your language. Just... get out of here. Honey, we just...! GET THE FUCK OUT! Honey... Wait in the car. BARBARA: Please! Wait for me in the car. It'll be fine. Please don't do anything... CAR!! [eerie vocal music] [whoosh] What've you told her? [eerie vocal music] Nothing. Did you tell her what you do? [intense drone] Tien doesn't know shit. Break it off. What? You heard me. [eerie vocal music] You can't be serious. CRATE: This is not open to discussion. FUCK YOU!! Who do you think you're talking to? I'm not some fucking politician. I am king and country. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I am the best thing that's ever going to happen to you. Alright? Don't you see it? She's playing you for the money. For MY money! It's not like that! CRATE: She's a drunk. All right? Can't you see what's gonna happen? You're fire, she's gas. You are heading for one big boom! Look what she did for me. That is the badge of a weak man. [metallic boom] You're not weak. Fine. Don't forget who pays the bills. You made your point. And that stuff about a job. She's just blowing smoke up your ass. All right? You got one purpose in this life and that's whatever the fuck I say it is. Get out. Break it off. [eerie vocal music] [muffled sounds] Fuck. [supernatural breath] [knocking at the door] Go away! [louder knocking] Said go away. TIEN: Massimo? Tien? Who are you? Well, hello to you too. [Beethoven plays backwards] [electric flutter] Can I come in? [Beethoven violin music] LUCKY: Ah, Chorazos. No, no wine. Something I gotta tell you, and you should listen, cause it's gonna change your life. [low drone] [growls, roars] [wine bottle smashes] [electric flutter] [squish!] [heartbeat] [Massimo gasps] [Skype ring] Massimo! "Messy Massimo." Are you okay? What do you mean? TIEN: I've been trying to get a hold of you for a week! A week? [reverse glass smash sound] TIEN: Babe, what's going on? [reverse glass smash sound] [GROWL!] MASSIMO: Tien, I... TIEN: You know, I was gonna try to get a hold of your parents, but you never gave me their... I can't see you anymore... It's not gonna work. Why? I... I don't understand. I'm sorry. I didn't want this to happen, not like this... Jesus, fuck! Talk to me. What's going on? TIEN: What's wrong? MASSIMO: You won't understand! What's going on? I fucked up... Babe, I fucked up real bad. [wine glass smash] [Beethoven violin music] Please don't do this! BARBARA: Honey. NO...! Get the fuck out! BARBARA: We just love you. You're not my mom. [Massimo sobs] [Beethoven violin music] [creepy voice] Baby, I'm not going anywhere. Stop it! TIEN: Is it the job? What? For Crate? MASSIMO: No, it's not that... TIEN: Don't call him. Don't call Crate. I'm telling you, don't call him. I don't know what else to do! Okay... All right... okay, we can... we can handle this... How deep are you in? What do you mean? TIEN: Crate. I know what's going on. I can help you. No, no. It's not Crate. I'm coming over. No, don't do that! WHY?! YOU CAN'T! Just... look, I'm sorry... WHAT IS GOING ON?! [angry growl !!!] What the hell was that? SOFIA: Honey? TIEN: Who's that? Who're you talking to? I'm Tien. Who are you? Thought you told her. [heartbeat] [Massimo crying] [bass hit] Who are you? Who do you want me to be? I'm Sofia. He didn't tell you? Tien... there's... something I need to tell you... You don't need to tell her shit. [sobbing] [loud kissing] Take a hint. [computer click] [cellphone vibrates] [Tien sighs] [long creepy sigh] LUCKY: Good boy. A week? LUCKY: The transformation takes time. We've got plenty of it. I can't remember anything. LUCKY: Look on the bright side. All those habits of your's... ...those appetites... ...can't hurt you now... [Sofia's breath] Indulge them. You're cute. [belt buckle] [heavy breathing, moans] MASSIMO: No, I can't! SOFIA: Oh, baby. I could just eat you up. [Spanish guitar] [coughing] [Spanish song] [car door slam] [Spanish song] [high pitch noise] [heartbeat] [muffled panting] [car engine] [Spanish song] TIEN: Baby... I'm not going anywhere. [door opens] [storage door rolls up] [zipper] CRATE: Why are we here? MASSIMO: You wanted to be discreet. [storage door shuts] CRATE: Yeah, but I choose the place. And not at fucking night. MASSIMO: It was a hot day. You ever think the sun is having a midlife crisis? You look like shit. [B ...B ] It's been hard for me. CRATE: How so? Going outside. Oh, yeah? Well, excuse the fuck out of me. All right. Sorry I cut into your nightlife you millennial soyboy piece of shit. Did you count it? MASSIMO: You wouldn't want that. Good boy. Just took my cut. Well, that would be counting it. Here. Your mother wants you to have that. Consider it a bonus. Like a raise? CRATE: Something like that. There any more? How's that? I mean, that's not much of a raise. So we're gonna talk about money? Look, if you want to talk about money... I've more than earned it. We're not gonna talk. I don't wanna talk about the money. You should know, it's about Tien. We're not going to talk about her either. Maybe we should. [gun hammer] You are a cock-sucking little cockroach. Be a pro. Do it right, or don't do it at all. Go ahead... Please. You are one dumb son of a bitch. Contact said for me to take the car and the bag... So get the fuck out. [car door opens] [car door slam] [footsteps on sand] [dramatic music] SOFIA: Why're you still going out there? MASSIMO: I miss the sun. So did my ex... Till about... Lincoln. MASSIMO: Ex? Believe it or not, vampires like monogamy. MASSIMO: What happened to him? SHE didn't care for LA, the people, the 21st Century. She just ripped your own guts out. Nickel's worth of free advice, stay away from people you care about. So that's why you don't want me calling Tien? SOFIA: Just looking out for you. That the only reason? SOFIA: You've got her eyes [heartbeat] [shoes shuffling] [heartbeat] [zipper] [Massimo coughs uncontrollably] [bombastic music] So how was the job? There was no job. SOFIA: Oh, no? THERE WAS NO JOB! Was there ever a job? MASSIMO: Course not. Those even taste good? MASSIMO: Course not. There was a job. I knew it. MASSIMO: Knew what? Knew you'd do this. MASSIMO: WHAT? Lie to me. Then double back. Then double back on the double back. I just told you the truth! You said there was no job! And there wasn't, until there was... He's my father... I owe him. Oh, my god. I'm your father now! Stop babying me. I'm not here to baby you. Look, I get it. You don't want me doing mortal things. Don't you do that. Don't you fucking do that! Guess what? SOFIA: I know what you're thinking. GUESS WHAT?! SOFIA: THERE'S NO CURE! I'M NOT GIVING UP! I'm out of here. If only. I'm not gonna play a rousing game of "bounce around the point". Bounce out the door. Forever. [macabre strings] SOFIA: It's not my job to carry your ass. You're not even a good lay. [heavy breathing] [bite] SOFIA: OW!! What the fuck was that? Did you bite me...? You're gonna fucking bite me?! For fuck sake! That hurt, you little shit! Think I'm fucking meat? [choking] You think it's fucking feeding time? Fuck you! You can go FUCK YOURSELF! [door slams] [macabre strings] TIEN: Baby... [moans, groans] TIEN: I'm not going anywhere. [kiss] [rubber hose] [tapping syringe] [heartbeat] [rubber hose snaps] [heartbeat] Sounds like something out of Alice in Wonderland. [louder heartbeat] Happy second birthday to you! MASSIMO: Sounds like something out of Alice and Wonderland. [string music] [light switch] [string music] Here's to the newborn. [Sofia laughing] [Sofia laughing] [deep screams] [exhale] Let's call this what it is. Next time you go out, you're going with a handler. A fucking handler. You should be ashamed of yourself. This is kindergarten bullshit we're talking here. [phone ring] [voice message] Hi, it's Tien. I'm out right now, making the dream come true. MASSIMO: Crate? CRATE: Yeah? What day is it? TIEN [message]: So, you know what to do. [BEEP] [rhythmic drums] MASSIMO: You cunt. Hi, honey. Get out. You don't get it. MASSIMO: Oh, what's that? This isn't something you can wiggle your way out of. I'll tell Tien. Bad idea. MASSIMO: I will. I told you to burn her number. I'll tell her everything! And tell her what... exactly? MASSIMO: You bitch. She wouldn't believe you anyway. I can at least tell her to get a crucifix. SOFIA: Those don't work. She can pick up garlic pills! SOFIA: You're an idiot. Why me? Honey, you're tired. You're still transitioning. No, I want to know! I think you owe me that. I don't owe you shit. You ruined my life! SOFIA: Not much to ruin. Answer me, goddammit! DON'T PUSH IT! [growling] Could give you the long story. That we've always been here. That we're legion. That we suck the blood of all thy race. But you know that. You've got Twitter. So that's it? That's all, Messy. And all there ever will be. So, long story short, your blood smelled like cherry syrup, and I was famished. [high pitch noise] [Massimo crying] [high pitch noise] Gets easier, once your tear ducts fall off. [Massimo cries louder] [Loud string hit] [growl] [record needle drop] MASSIMO: So is there like a rule book or something? We're not Shriners. [house music beats] Come on. Nine times out of ten, the sun doesn't mean shit. But it hurts. Yeah, I figured that out for myself. SOFIA: Then why go out? MASSIMO: I have to work. For what? For food? That's done. But I'm hungry all the time. You know why. ["Sweet, like midnight rain. Brings you back again."] MASSIMO: Okay, what is this? SOFIA: That's O-Ayer, or the O.A.E. SOFIA: Supposedly, it's the first word of the first name... ...of the first being born in the universe. MASSIMO: So bullshit. SOFIA: Maybe. Gobbledegook! Okay, you know what? Lay off! ["...like Blood on Chocolate."] ["Embrace what you've become..."] Okay, so... it's... it's like your religion? It's a big part of our history. O-Ayer isn't male or female. It's not really consciousness as we think of it. It's more like this thing that... ...permeates existence. MASSIMO: Creepy. It's a metaphysical concept. It's not like there's something actually... ...out there. MASSIMO: Tell that to the Pope. A lot of people did. In the 12th Century. They were burned. Friends of yours...? What else? SOFIA: Like Holy Water? MASSIMO: Something like that. There's nothing like that. No stakes. No crosses. Everything is just marking time. What do you mean? Nothing can stop you... but you. Sounds like an infomercial. Fine! Then fuck off! No! I... I want to hear it. You got to know all the tricks. It's a game. Mind-over-matter, like an athlete. Mind-over-matter. Here... Let me show you. SOFIA: Hold your hand over that. Bet I can get it first. You're like a mile away. Then it should be easy. One... two... three! [bang] [whoosh] Jesus! Soon you'll be able to do that. Shit. Whatever you think you had, it's gone. You pissed it all away. Now you gotta stay active. What d'you mean? Hunting. You gotta stay on the prowl. Otherwise you start to lose track of time. Faces, places. Even your own name. I can't. Most blood-born, shall we say, contagions... they affect the body. This affects everything else. What about animal blood? That's anemia. That's a slow death. That's not gonna cut it. When the time comes, you'll know what to do. Besides, Job did his whole submissive, dominatrix dance with his Creator, and didn't get shit. At least you'll get laid. [male sex moans] [running water] Oh... Oh, Jesus... Fucking Chirst! [teeth break] [running water] [sound of teeth clinking] SOFIA [echo] : Can you feel her? No. SOFIA [echo] : Concentrate. [Massimo sniffs] Her perfume. SOFIA [echo] : What about it? It's bad. She's at the... [knocking] Coming! MASSIMO: Hello? CANDY: Hey there. MASSIMO: Hi.

Uh, yeah... it's... uh... Are you okay? Uh huh. What's wrong with your lip? Oh, no. Uh... nothing, nothing... nothing. Okay. I'm... I'm gonna make a quick call. Yeah. SOFIA [echo] : She's not calling anyone. I know. SOFIA [echo] : You can feel it, can't you? You can feel her. She's got no one to call. SOFIA [echo] : What else do you feel? [sniffing] She's got a kid. SOFIA [echo] Ignore that. A boy. SOFIA [echo] : Ignore it! She doesn't know where he is. SOFIA [ echo] : So she's got no one. No. SOFIA [ echo] : Perfect. Hah. [sniffing] She's AB Negative. SOFIA [echo] : Good. Smells thick... Like Maraschino cherries. SOFIA [echo] : What does that tell you? I don't know. SOFIA [echo] : You got this. I don't know! SOFIA [echo] : Concentrate. High glucose. She's hyperglycemic. Never given blood. SOFIA [echo] : Very good. She's had gonorrhea. SOFIA [echo] : Doesn't matter. I don't like it. SOFIA [echo] : You will. Her perfume is terrible... Candy? [door opens] Oh! Heh. Hi there. Are you peeking? Sorry... sorry... sorry. No problem. We all have our kinks. I'm sorry. Mister Shy-Guy, Mister Shy-Guy, Mister Shy-Guy. Um... How about a drink? No, that's cool. Wine? No, no. Its okay. [demon voice] C'mon. No, it's okay. Really. Soda. I got soda. Oh... Uh, in a can? Of course. And it's in there...? Okay. Uh, sorry I don't have any... Diet. Oh, that's all right. Regular is fine. Just, you know, that's a lot of sugar. [soda opening] Yeah. [drinking] Wow. Thirsty girl. Uh huh. Do you have a trash? I, uh... I recycle. Oh...! Oh, which one is it? It's the, uh, the... It's the small one? Yeah? Hahahaha. Oh, my god, you're so cute! Mmm... You know, I used to have a bae, and he had three big bins, but they were like all sorts of colors for all his shit. But they were big though, like they were big, I mean BIG big. Yeah, it's pretty common. Oh, I don't think so. Yeah, no... it, it is... it's standard. Standard? Uh, pretty standard. Look, I, um...Look, I gotta tell you something. Hey! Hey, who's that? Is that your sister...? Cause she's hot. She's, uh... she's out of town. Yeah? Relax. Let's get this shirt off. You know, you've got me for an hour, but you could have me for the whole night for $200. Yeah...? Cool. Yeah? You got the cash? Yeah, I got it. Do you want the $200? Yeah, I got all that. Okay, baby... Let's do some shots. Shots? Yeah, let's do some shots. CANDY: Hey...! CANDY: Everything okay? [door opens, closes] [Duduk music] ["Happy birthday to you... you live in a shoe..."] ["But that's not so bad... 'cause it's a Jimmy Choo."] [Duduk music] [House music beat] ["Sweet, like midnight rain. Brings you back again."] ["I can feel your blood flowing through my veins."] ["I can feel your heartbeat throbbing inside my brain."] [bedroom door unlocks, opens] Hey, I put a record on the player. MASSIMO: Got something better here. Oh, shit. Is that the shit? MASSIMO: Let's, um, let's party. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's party. Ah, I like it. Hahaha. Mmm... this is gonna be juicy. [lighter] Tell me something. CANDY: What up? ["Embrace what you've become."] Candy is not your real name. Sure, it is. No, it's not. I know it's not. CANDY: Okay, how do you know that? I can smell it. Okay, that's really weird. Why is that weird? CANDY: Well, it's just really weird. I mean, but I like weird, so... Hah. So what's your real name? What do you want it to be? [heavy breathing] [muffled music] Why do you...? Why do you...? [fly unzipping] C'mon, just lay back. [sucking] [female moan] You shouldn't have left him. What...? What're you talking about? He's your son. Who the fuck are you? You gotta call him. What...? What the fuck is going on? I'm sorry. You should go. [knocking] Shit! CANDY: What? What's going on? What is it? Um... where's my shirt? Fuck your shirt! [knocking] MASSIMO: Hold on! Where's my money? It's gonna be okay. Mom?! What're you doing? I have to tell you something... Who are you? I... I... I'm... Uh, this is Candy, mom. She's... Your father is dead. CANDY: Oh, shit. MASSIMO: Crate?! I didn't know where else to go. Hang on, hang on... CANDY: I'm sorry. WHO'RE YOU?! Hang on. Crate wasn't even sick. Mom, Mom... What happened? Just tell me. Mom?! Hey, hey. Give her a second. Sit down. There was an accident. I was in the car... He was driving. They said he didn't suffer. My dad died in a car accident. I know. [bite] [neck snap] Mmm, that was fun. You crazy cunt. Oh... don't act so precious. C'mon... it's supper time. [echo] supper time... supper time... [low note] [heavy breathing] [gum ripping] [low growling] [music stinger] [shower curtain] [car trunk] [grunting] [shower curtain] [camera clicking] [camera clicking, clicking] [trunk slam] [insect noise] [gasp] [door opens] [sizzling] Good morning, honey. [clatter] [slow footsteps] [echo] [echo] [heavy breathing] [moaning] What's wrong, honey? [Tibetan drums] Fuck you. Man, you need to lighten up. Lighten up? Okay, I get it. Ground rules. I'm gonna kill you. How? [phone vibrating] Saved by the dinner bell. That's not gonna happen. Not gonna be anymore goddamn dinner bells. Oh, yeah? Wait till you throw up that breakfast I made you. Believe me, it's not because of my cooking. Hello...? Yeah, Sparks and Third... In an hour. Yeah, got it. Why do you keep doing that? You don't owe anyone anything, anymore. Told you. Feel free to leave. I'm not gonna do that. I love you. Are you fucking kidding me? Wow. You know, you're an asshole! Oh, I'm the asshole? That guy is not worth your time. No shit. But I'm not giving up on my mom or my life or any of it, just to please you. That's what I thought, until my dad tried to burn me at the stake. MASSIMO: Oh, yeah? What'd you do? Take a wild guess. You don't even know me. Universal donor... Inflamed veins. MASSIMO: That's nothing. It's nothing. Came from The Scots. Clan Ronald Mc-fucking- Donald. You're a clown! Yeah, right. I don't know you. What? Got an idea. [cap snaps off] Okay, now you're just fucking with me. [macabre strings] What the fuck are you supposed to be? Some sort of fucking weird mime? Yeah, Massimo the Mime. Who're you? I'm Gage. As far as you're concerned... I'm your guardian fucking angel. Drive, mother fucker. Whatever. [car engine turns on] There's a virus out there. The world... has gone bug-house. Tell me about it. Chinks, fucking eating monkey brains. They found an elephant with syphilis. Who in their right mind would fuck an elephant? There goes my Friday night. I got it, I got it. Listen... If somebody was to fuck an elephant... MASSIMO: You know, I could put on some music... The right person for that job is Crate! Yeah, Crate is right-as-rain. Yeah, you're lucky. MASSIMO: Oh, yeah? How's that? Crate... Takes care of his own... Took care of me when I was in prison. You were in prison? Never thought twice. What were you in for? Doesn't fucking matter. Telling you, your dad's a fucking saint, kid. He's not my dad. He's not your fucking dad? That's fucking cold, kid. Ice cold. Fuck. You should probably work on that fucking attitude. Yeah! You're probably right! You know, it's all right. I'd do anything for fucking Crate. Fuck you. [soft breeze] [train] [car engine] [engine turns off] So, Massimo. How's this go? Grab the stuff. Yeah. Go to the unit. And then? MASSIMO: That's it. Is it? What's the supposed to mean? I mean, you're out here all day. MASSIMO: So? So, four to six hours is a long time. It costs us money, kid. It's a full tank out here. I gotta eat. And that's it? You want a fucking inventory, or something? Like a manifest? Like I'm some fucking trucker, or something?! You need to calm down, sweetheart. Fuck! [music stinger] [door slam] Fucking cunt. [door opens] Cigarette? Nah, man. ...Fuck. Yeah, I remember this place. 16-years-old, doing runs through here. Young, dumb, and full of cum.

MASSIMO: Guilty as charged. You like that freaky-deaky shit, huh? Freaky-deaky. That explains the get-up. They got a pill for that these days, young man. So who's your favorite? Favorite? Everybody's got a favorite bitch. Candy. Candy... Sounds sweet. She was. Was? Not gonna see her anymore. Well... She sounds like one stacked pancake. She look anything like this? How did you get those? Cuz, cocksucker. That's my fucking job. Listen... We know you've been tasting, kid. No, I don't. No... you don't? MASSIMO: Nope. GAGE: No, you don't take a taste? No. You stupid fucking cocksucker! Are you fucking telling me you don't fucking taste?! MASSIMO: No, sir! Look at me, you fucking little junkie! You think I'm a clown like you?! Huh? You think I'm a fucking clown? I see the track marks on your fucking arm...! Huh?! You think I can't smell the cancer? GAGE: The fuck did you just say, weirdo? You got a year... tops. Fuck you, you little cocksucker! The fuck you think you are, you fucking piece of shit! Hahaha! Look at you , motherfucker. Your dad was too much of a pussy to do what needed to be done. Not me, motherfucker. Good night. [roar] Christ! You fucking bit me, you cocksucker! [gunshot] Goddamn. Fucking homo. You fucking bit me?! What the fuck? Queer fucking bit me. [footsteps] [low breathing] Fucking cocksucker. [growl] [loud ripping] [dog barking] [menacing music] [sand rustling] [dog barking] [coughing] Shhh... shhh, it's okay. Tien? Are you here? [coughing] All right. MASSIMO: Are you here? TIEN: For now. [pooping] I can't see. TIEN: I know. It's gonna be okay. [pooping] What is that smell...? Oh, god. What did I do? What is that smell? Oh, my god. What did I do? Oh, shit. Oh, god. Someone, please, someone help me. Well, it is about time for you to lay in your native soil. Shhh. I'm right here. Stop it! What? You're not her. [loud coughing] [vomiting] [low note] [Tibetan drums] [Tibetan drums] [Drum hit] [incoherent mumbling] [rapid series of electrical hits] [backwards masking] [electrical hit] [bat wings] [dub step] [door opening] What the fuck is this? MASSIMO: It's calming. Well, aren't you hot shit? I can't see fuck all in here. [lights turn on] I gotta use the can. Where's it at? Yo! Earth to fuck-head. I heard you. CRATE: Then you know what to do. What's that? CRATE: Answer me. I did. You didn't say shit. And that was my answer. Fuck you. You got eyes. No, you answer me when I talk to you. Piss yourself. CRATE: How's that? You do it all the time anyway. Say that again. Say it again! Kidney's aren't what they used to be. [slap] [ominous music] You son of a bitch. Lot of blood in that piss. How'd you know that? MASSIMO: You oughta get that checked. I oughta kill you. I'd like to see you try. [toilet flush] [light switch] Look at this place. Fucking pigsty. [rattling dishes] So who's this tough fuck? You know, when you were a kid, you had some respect. Kids are stupid. No. Kids listen. They understand. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. I mean, have you learned nothing? Not a goddamn thing. That just makes me tired all over. Guess you wasted your time. CRATE: Did I? Besides that was a lifetime ago. CRATE: Not to me. Cause you're old. See, what is that? MASSIMO: What? This smart-ass, piss-poor mouth of yours. New me, I guess. How can you be so arrogant? I gave you everything. You didn't give me shit. CRATE: Your whole life. Get in line. CRATE: I made you. Didn't do a very good job. That breaks my heart. Nah, I think the cholesterol will take care of that. Shut up! What I do is between me and God! And the DNA of the 53 women you fucked... 54, if this new blonde works out. What is this psychic shit, man? Where are you getting this? Look, how would you like it if I told you something that you don't want to hear. MASSIMO: Thrill me. About your mom. MASSIMO: My mom? She sleeps next to me every night. Okay? And I got all the numbers, all the addresses. Good for you. Including that little piece. Tien. MASSIMO: You think that's leverage? I got more. MASSIMO: I'm shaking. Yeah, you should be... Tien know about your moonlighting? Oh, you mean the whore. CRATE: I bet she doesn't. So tell her. CRATE: Just like that? Doesn't mean shit to me. I'm not buying it. No, that's not gonna cut it. Not trying to cut it. CRATE: You can't protect her. I don't care. Don't try to poker face me. You don't have the face. One call. One text. I press one button, and those two are best friends. You act like you're talking to Messy Massimo right now... Everything's changed. Just like that? MASSIMO: All bets are off. I don't believe that. In fact, if I was you I'd be pissing myself. I'd be fucking shaking. [monstrous laugh] You got nothing. And what do you got? What's with this attitude? You got an ace up your sleeve? sleeve Is she here? That's it, isn't it? Son-of-a-bitch. CRATE: Tien...? Tien?! [swoosh] [monstrous roar] Hold it! [gun cock] MASSIMO: Cute. Get over there. So now what? [electric flutter] What was that? Just marking my territory. This was meant to be a social call. All right? Nice and civil. MASSIMO: With a gun. Is that how you took care of my associate? MASSIMO: The hit man? It was a friendly conversation. MASSIMO: Also with a gun. So what happened to him? Like you said. All friendly. What happened to Gage? Gage had it coming. Look, I put my ass on the line for you for 20 fucking years. That's just the blink of an eye. I went into the arena over and over. I was your gladiator. MASSIMO: Gladiators die. You could've been a Made Man. But now... You're just an asshole. You're the one who sent Gage. Believe me... I didn't want that. But you got sloppy. Now, I'm gonna make a deal with you. Same deal I made with your Dad. You're gonna walk out that door. You're gonna go down to Mexico, and you're gonna never come back. No calls. No contact. Just gone forever, all right? Otherwise, you're gone forever. Just like that? You disappear. -In a puff of smoke, poof. What's your answer? -Fly away on leathery wings. Don't be an idiot. What deal did my Dad take? Bet I can grab that gun faster than you... No. Here. Put your hand out. You're a dumb shit. One... CRATE: Don't make me do this. MASSIMO: Oh, I'm gonna get the gun. Oh, you think so? It's what it is... Two... I never liked you. THREE! [roar] [ripping] [chewing] SOFIA: Chewy. [growl] [biting] MASSIMO: No, no, no, no! No! Relax. What did you do? SOFIA: A favor. Oh, my god! SOFIA: He was going to kill you. He killed your father. You're lying! You know, it's true... You can hear it. No, no, no. The voices. [people mumbling] Stop it! The transformation is complete. Get out of my head! [punch] [moan] [people mumbling] [bones cracking] [moaning] [fresh guts] What're you doing? It's over. [dripping blood] [guts ripping] No! We're the last ones! [guts ripping] You need me. You need me. [bite] [neck break] [body fall] I'll take my chances. [Duduk music] [heartbeats] You know... Your blood is as good as gold to me. Maybe the most precious thing in the world. [heartbeat slows] But I think I'm just gonna let it run out. [choking gasps for breath] Because I'm done taking anything from you. [death gasps] [final heartbeats] You're nothing but a waste. [Skype ring] Massimo? Hey, babe. Where are you? Home, sweet home. Are you alone? For now. Okay, great. Stay there. I'm coming over. I'm not going anywhere. TIEN: There's something I gotta tell you. [click] It's your funeral. [ominous stinger] [muffled knocking] [electric flutter] [knocking] [door opening creak] Where are you? MASSIMO: What's the matter? Nothing, I... MASSIMO: You waiting for an invitation? [whoosh] [door slams] You did that all by yourself. That's good, I think. Massy... You okay? MASSIMO: Never better. You want, um, You want something to drink? I mean, everything's kind of laying around here, so... I mean, I tell ya... It's been hell. No! Nothing! I'm... I'm fine! And the bottle of Chorazos is already gone. It's just gone. I have been so worried about you. So you don't want some wine? TIEN: Forget the wine! What's going on...? Have you been sick? More or less. Oh, yeah. You feel cold. Do you have any other symptoms? What're you a doctor now? TIEN: Well, ever since you broke up with me... It's hard for me to focus on anything else. Let it go. You know, I've been thinking about what you said. The text I sent you. Yeah, about the tests. And? It's gonna be hard for you to hear, but I went and I took them. All of them. There were about ten. I even took the AIDS test. And they found... nothing. [string music] That's something. Wait, there's more. You should go. Just listen to me. [light switch] Please, just go. I'm not leaving. You're lucky it didn't get you. You're not listening to me. Stay here and something bad is gonna happen to you. The hospital... They ran a DNA test. DNA test? I gave them some of your clothes. They found something really rare. [roar] Holy shit! You can't stay here! Wait! MASSIMO: She's coming. She's coming... She's coming... She's coming... Sofia is... There is no Sofia! What?! No, no, you... Just listen to me. You saw her! When? When she said I couldn't see you. There is no Sofia. You talked to her. I was talking to you. [stinger] What's going on? [pounding sounds] [mournful strings] Get... Get away! Just get away! Honey? Who is that? Who're you talking to? Get away, get away, get away. Sofia. Who are you talking to? Who are you? Um... I'm Tien... Who are you? Who are you...? Who are you...? There's... she's, um... She's... Tien, there's something... There's something I need to tell you. I was talking to you, Massy. We were on the phone. You were talking to no one. There was no one there. You were talking to no one. But that's not what happened. You don't remember? I saw... I saw... What did you see? There... there was this creature. [quiet growling] What? [growling] I won't let it take you. Massy... Where did you see this creature? I can't remember. I can't remember. I can't remember. I can't remember, I can't remember, I can't remember. I can't... I can't remember. I can't remember. It happened that night. [string music] [necklace clinking] When we made love. Yes, yes. That's it... We were in bed. We started talking about the Penanggalan. [stinger] Crate knew my Dad. Helped set me up. Odd jobs, here and there. [seizure] [teeth grinding] Hey... what's... what's wrong? Hey... what's going on...? What's the matter? Baby?! Are you okay?! What's going on? Babe! Are you okay?! [bone crack] [convulsion, moans] [long hissing] [hissing] [bone crack] [stinger] Baby, what's going on? What's wrong?! [long hissing] [Tibetin drums] [bass music] [bone cracks] [hitting wall] [electric flutter] [bone cracking] [high pitch sound] [hiss] [loud hiss] [string music] You disassociated for an hour. I did? You didn't remember anything, like nothing had ever happened. But then... we were good for a while. [dramatic bass stinger] [mournful strings] And then that Sofia thing started happening. [weeping] [drum] Break it off. What? You heard me. [drum] You can't be serious. This is not open to discussion. [drum] MASSIMO: Fuck you! [boom] [weeping] I'm so sorry, Tien. I'm so sorry. Shhh, it's not your fault. CRATE: Don't you see it? She is playing you. CRATE: For the money. For my money! I had to protect you. [gunshot] Oh, god... [death gasps] You know, I found out about your father. He went to Mexico... he's dead. I know. I'm sorry. You're gonna walk out that door. You're gonna go down to Mexico. You're gone forever. Crate killed him. No, no, no... He died in a hospital. What...? What? He must've found out he had the same thing you did. What're you talking about? It's a rare genetic disease. No... no... It affects the nervous system. Causes hallucinations. Blackouts. It's hereditary. Hereditary?! He must've been trying to find a cure. That's why he left. They didn't know what it was about back then. [loud weeping] All the things I've seen, they were just... Oh, my god! Don't you see? None of this is your fault. You were born with it! Everything I've done! But you haven't done anything. [echo] Oh, my god... [roar] [flash] You take these pills. You take them twice a day. They stop the hallucinations. You don't have to live this way. There's a cure. There's no cure! Baby... I'm not going anywhere. Nice try... you cunt! Ahh! I'm gonna kill you. [choking] It's... not... real. Stop it! You're not Tien! You're not Tien! [choking] Please... ...stop... I'm gonna rip your fucking face off! Oh, my god. [gasps] [coughing] I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. [quiet gasps] I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. [cough] I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. You're just sick. You're just sick. [kiss] [gasp] [house music] ["I can feel your blood flowing through my veins. I can feel your heartbeat throbbing inside"] ["my brain. I can feel the feeling that's taking you higher. I know what sets"] ["your soul on...fire."] ["Sweet like midnight rain.
