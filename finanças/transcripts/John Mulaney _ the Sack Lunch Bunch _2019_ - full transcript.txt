So, I have a lot of big fears. Like a big asteroid hitting the Earth, or other stuff like that, you know? And sometimes I was afraid of getting hit by the ball in baseball, but my biggest fear of all time is drowning because-- And that's why I'm afraid of swimming because I'm afraid of drowning. I did take swimming classes and I hated it, okay? I hated it so much. Every week... I had it every Saturday. That was my least favorite week-- day of the week, for that year, and I would scream and cry before the swimming class because I was afraid I was going to drown. Because I don't want my life to be over yet. Actually, I'm afraid of death, but out of all the ways to die, I don't want to drown. I don't want to drown, okay? - John, suck in your gut. - Oh... Hi, I'm John Mulaney, and this is the Sack Lunch Bunch. - Oh, hi! - Oh, hi there! Hey, welcome to the show. - May I go to the bathroom? - Yeah, uh, sure. What you're about to see is a children's TV special, and I made it on purpose. It's a show for kids by adults with kids present. Recently, I watched children's TV and I didn't like it at all. But I liked it when I was a kid, which means it was better back then. So I made it like then. I have no children of my own, and that's by choice. Sometimes I say, "I don't have kids yet," but that's just to appease certain people. Getting to know the Sack Lunch crew, though-- I mean, we hung out a lot. I realize these kids have a lot on their minds that I want to explore. - Can I ask a question? - Yeah, shoot. - What's the tone of this show? - How do you mean? She means, is it ironic, or do you like doing a children's show? We talk a lot about that. That's the million dollar question. Well, first off, I like doing the show. I mean, The Sack Lunch Bunch is fun. But honestly, like, if this doesn't turn out great, I think we should all be like, "Oh, it was ironic." And then people will be like, "Oh, that's hilarious." But if it turns out very good, be like, "Oh, thank you, we worked really hard," and act fake humble, and then you win either way. That's the first lesson of this special, I just decided. You can go very far in life if you pretend to know what you're doing. A lot of people in TV thrive that way. Name names. Sister, I could for hours. ♪ It's John Mulaney ♪ ♪ And the Sack Lunch Bunch ♪ ♪ We're gonna have a lot of fun ♪ ♪ Gotta lotta songs and guest stars too ♪ ♪ Well, actually for guest stars There's only one ♪ ♪ Let's all see what's on kids' minds ♪ ♪ The guest star's name is Richard Kind ♪ ♪ What adventures will we find ♪ ♪ Hangin' with the Sack Lunch Bunch? ♪ ♪ We'll keep hangin' on ♪ ♪ With the Sack Lunch Bunch ♪ ♪ With the Sack Lunch Bunch ♪ ♪ With the Sack Lunch Bunch ♪ ♪ Hangin' with the Sack Lunch Bunch ♪ Can you spot the differences between these two images?

They're green, okay. Alex, what do you have? Well, this is my Grandpa Joe and my Grandma Katherine. Ooh. Yeah, that's definitely them. That's Joe Jackson and Katherine Jackson. - Uh, your mother is their daughter? - My father. - Your father is-- - My father's parents. Your father is their son. How to phrase? Uh, was your dad, like, a very popular singer when he was a kid and then an even bigger singer when he was an adult, or just the first part? I'll be candid. My dad is Marlon Jackson of the Jackson 5. Oh. Marlon. I have no questions about him. Did you have grandparents, John? In a sense. I mean, both of my parents had two parents, so, yeah. And then there was this guy, Paul. John? Who's Paul? Well, Cordelia, sometimes elderly people go steady. - They do? - Yeah.

Whatever happened to Paul? Well, Cordelia, sometimes heaven needs one extra special-- No, no, no. I know he died. He was 88 in 1990. I want to know when and how he croaked. Okay, when he's 89, he has a series of strokes. Lives. Then he gets colon cancer, beats it. Then my grandmother killed him with a gun thinking he was an intruder, and that's how he died. Whoa. Sounds like old Paul had quite a life. He certainly did. He's no Marlon Jackson, but... Hey! What are you reading? Have you ever spied on your parents? Well, a boy named Sascha does in the book I read this week called Sascha's Dad Does Drag. One night, Sascha's lying in bed when he hears... Clonk, clonk, clonk... He sneaks downstairs to see what the noise was. Is it a woodpecker? Is it a hammer? No! It's his dad, in size-11 platform heels, bad padding, fishnets, and a cheap Supremes wig. His mom says, "Good luck, honey," and his dad walked out the door. But Sascha, quiet as a mouse, snuck into the back seat and hid under a blanket. Then they drove and drove and drove. Then they got to the Duplex, and Sascha saw a sign that said, "Amateur Drag Night." Sascha knew that the Duplex meant one thing: his dad better have the realness. But his dad did not. Sascha leaned against the bar next to some vicious queens. His dad went into a low-rent version of Mariah Carey's "Vision of Love," and the queens pounced. "She should take her 1997 worn-out drag to the Museum of Natural History because that is a dinosaur." And even though Sascha was embarrassed, he couldn't deny they were right to throw shade. Sascha went outside to see his dad dragging a roller suitcase. "Dad, I didn't know you did drag," Sascha says. "Because you don't. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it because, like a chubby queen in a corset, the truth always has a way of spilling out." The rest of the book is them updating his tired act. And even though his dad doesn't win the Astoria Glamour Drag Ball, it's still pages of fun. My one critique is that it focuses too much on the New York drag scene and not the West Coast and Southern houses. If you want to read a book that I give five out of five pencils, pick up Sascha's Dad Does Drag and the Act Needs Work at your local library. Okay. First off, I want to thank all of you for helping us with this focus group for Sony Animation's new movie, Bamboozled. It's the sequel to Bamboo, which came out in 2009 before any of you were born. Now, you've just seen the first and final cut of the film. It's 84 minutes long. We'd love to get any reactions you have. First thoughts, there are no wrong answers. Yes? Um, the reason I like this movie... is because it's my favorite movie of all time. Interesting. Now, you said the same thing last weekend at the focus group for - President Minions. President Minions was my favorite movie, but that movie is nothing to me now. That is the past. I am a new woman. - You're all about Bamboo 2 now? - Yeah. Bamboozled is my identity now. It's my Halloween costume, my birthday theme, my thermos. It will be my favorite-- - Hold on. I'm writing this down. - Good. It will be my favorite movie forever. Wow. Strong words. Raise your hands if this movie that you just saw, Bamboo 2: Bamboozled, is your favorite movie of all time. Okay, that's unanimous. And who among you thinks you might run home and tell the entire plot of the movie breathlessly to the first adult they see? In the movie, the koala, Kimmy, has-- Yeah, I produced it, I know. But yeah. Kimmy the Koala has to go find her mojo, so she goes to the jungle, and then they fall in the mud, - and at the end there's a song. - Yeah. One part I forgot was when the kangaroo falls on his butt. Could we use that entire thing as the log line to the movie? You may. All right. Let's talk about some of the characters. Sir? Excuse me. Um, the woman said I could leave at 5:00, but I can leave at 5:30. That's great feedback. Thank you. Now, the studio spared no expense getting some very big names to voice the different, you know, animals or whatever. Who knows who did the voice of Benji the Cockatiel? Mark Ruffalo! That's right! Mark Ruffalo! From You Can Count On Me. HBO's The Normal Heart. Would you raise your hands if knowing that Mark Ruffalo is doing the voice of the cockatiel enhanced your experience of the movie? That is unanimous. Okay. And who do we think did the voice of Kiki the Boa Constrictor? Elizabeth Banks. At first I was like, "Who is this? Is it Anna Kendrick? Is it Elizabeth Banks?" And it was. Wasn't Anna Kendrick Dottie the Dodo? Very good. It was Anna Kendrick. But who knows who did the voice of her husband and/or brother, Danny the Dodo? It was definitely someone, and, frankly, it was driving me crazy. Okay, raise your hands if you could tell that the voice of Danny the Dodo was someone, but you couldn't quite place him. It was Jeremy Renner. Oh! Oh, yeah. Finally. Now, the wise old wombat-- - Mandy Patinkin! - Yes! Mandy Patinkin. How early did you know? Immediately. As soon as he exhaled through his nose, I turned to the man next to me and said, "That's our Mandy!" You were sitting next to a man you didn't know? When I came back from the bathroom, I sat next to the wrong dad. How many times did you go to the bathroom? - Five. Four productive. - Hm. - One thing! - Yes. My name's Isabella. This is my favorite movie. I went to the bathroom nine times. I just want to tell you about what happens in this one scene of the movie. I produced it, so I know. But yeah. All the lady emus are at the water, and then the song comes in. Ah, the song, "Today Is the Day" by Ed Sheeran, written for this movie, but not in context. The song comes on and they, like... And then they go... Yeah. Yep. The scene where they dance around, yeah. They do dance around. Okay. Thank you so much for that. Now, when they're down at the river, Arnold the Wombat-- Dax Shepard! Absolutely is Dax Shepard. ...says something is "fake news." Now, did any of you get that joke? No? Okay. Did anyone's parents laugh at that joke? Yeah. A light laugh? An acknowledgment. That's all it deserves. I can't thank you enough for this. You've given us your feedback, but more importantly, you've given us your time. Now, no one goes home empty-handed, so as you're leaving, some woman is gonna give you a backpack shaped like a koala that's fairly useless, and it is filled with tubes of yogurt. Thank you so much. Thank you. Uh, could you tell us, what's one of your biggest fears? I have a fear of playing soccer. My biggest fear... is being too scared to take risks. ...of needles and pigeons. Do you find the world is a scary place or a not scary place? Scary place. You think-- Like, everyday life is scary? Yes. Home invasions. I don't want anyone in my home. One of my biggest fears is, like, tarantulas and spiders and bugs in general. But another one is, like, if I get under a 90 % on a test, my mom gets really mad. And when my mom gets mad, um, I'm toast. Are you afraid of a lone pigeon? I don't know what that means. Sorry. If you saw one single pigeon, not a flock. Probably not. If there were, like, three or more then I would probably be afraid. When three or more pigeons are gathered. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Are there any fears that are your mom's fears that you feel like you've gotten from her? Yeah, definitely home invasions. Can you guess what we're looking at before we zoom out? You see it every day. Keep guessing. It's the October '95 issue of People magazine featuring Larry Hagman's death scare. Yeah! But why do I need an algebra tutor? Because you're not good at it. Now, I talked to the parents at your school, the rich parents. They say this tutor is a miracle worker. Those were their words. A miracle worker. There he is. You listen. Hello, you must be-- Call me "the Tutor." My valise. My textbooks, a few toiletries and incidentals. So, which one of you is the 12-year-old boy, Jonah? Him or you? He is. This is your math exam. Sit! Disgraceful. This guy is great. Who cares if I'm bad at algebra? I'm never gonna need it in real life. What you know about real life could fit into a thimble on the thumb of tiny Jiminy Cricket. Understand? I used to be like you. Didn't care for school. Didn't care for math. Loved Creole cooking and Chopin. Just like you. I thought, "When will I ever need algebra?" - You know what, Jonah? - What? If I had known algebra, I would not have lost my eye. I'll sing a song about karmic wrath.

Up next, we're gonna meet a spinster-- - Oh, whoa! - What was that picture? Did you tell 'em about Ronnie? Uh, okay, I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry that no one told you that Ronnie DiMaria, the guy who played Googy, died yesterday. Wait, what? Oh, did you not know there was a guy in the Googy costume? Yeah, that bald male actor with the mustache, he was Googy. So every time you hugged Googy, you were actually hugging Ronnie DiMaria. But you're not anymore because Ronnie DiMaria died yesterday. I think I once saw that guy coming out of the bathroom. Yeah, that would have been Ronnie. But you know what? He died doing what he loved. Dressing up in the Googy costume, and running around to make people laugh. He died during the shoot? Those are supposed to be funny? They're supposed to be fun. They're, like, energy. I dunno. They help with transitions in the show. And, no, Oriah, he didn't die during the shoot. He died well after he wrapped, when he was already in his car. Because he was running around in the costume? No, the costume had nothing to do with it 'cause he died so long after he wrapped shooting. Right, Tyler? You were there. My call time was at 3:00, and he was dead at 3:00. Look, listen. Ronnie had an enlarged heart. And isn't that kinda fitting? That he died 'cause his heart was too big? You knew about his medical condition? Well, I seem to recall a group of kids yelling, "Run, Googy, run." Oh, yes. Shoe's on the other foot. That's a big lie! Those are recorded out of context. Look, I don't wanna talk about his death anymore. I wanna watch clips of him when he was alive, making us laugh. I'm still surprised those were supposed to be funny. They're funny in Europe. Roll tape. Go, Googy! Work out! Go, Googy! Sauna! Don't be alone, Googy! Make a friend! Googy, meet Binky! Friendship! - Oh, no. - Not Binky. Don't worry, kids. Denny Greenberg, the actor who played Binky-- Binky is an actor in a costume-- is not dead. He is... ...missing! Did he have known mental health issues? Did he have no mental health issues? - He's a deranged adult running around-- - I said, - "Did he have known mental health issues?" - Oh, I misheard you. Yes, Denny Greenberg had schizophrenia, which many people have. Anyway, he will come home, Binky will, and he will be alive, not dead. Then why do you have a photo for him like he was dead? Oh, I have "in memoriam" photos for everyone in the cast. Does anyone want to see theirs? No? All right, I'll show you mine. Can we see mine? Oh, no. No, that's Suri's. Sorry. I'm very sorry, Suri. All right, there I am. See? That's nice. That's me doing stand-up, and it says 1982 to who knows when. Hopefully, a very long time. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Friendship! Um, I'm scared of clowns. I am also afraid of clowns. "Oh, no, I'm too scared to leave the house. A clown might get me." And they were like, "You know what? We're gonna take her to therapy." Around October 2016, around that, a lot of clown sightings were happening. There were clown scares where, like, people were just, like, threatening other people in clown suits. You sit on a couch, then the therapist is sitting on a chair, and they pull up these random pictures of clowns. I was, like, really cautious from that point on, from, like, being aware of my surroundings and everything like that. And, like, one week, the clown was, like, really scary, and I almost died. But I didn't die. So, that Halloween came, and I saw a clown on the street in an apartment building, like, ringing the doorbell, and I was like, "Oh, no, I'm going across the street." So, I cross the street, and I avoided contact. So, yeah. Have you ever thought of dressing as a clown - and facing yourself in the mirror? - Actually, the therapist made me do that. She made me put on a costume. And then she was like, "Okay, let's put on makeup." I'm like, "No, I'm good." So, then I left... in the costume! You said during the time of the clown sightings... - Yes. - ...it was something people talked about. It was something people talked about. - In October of 2016. - Mm-hmm. Did you like this therapist? I mean, she was just trying to help me get over my fears, you know? - That's one way to look at it, yes. - Yeah. Transfer is available to the M15 select bus service.

I just couldn't go to bed because that trailer was stuck in my mind. And now I'm just, like, watching out for my, like, evil twin. My biggest fear is doppelgängers killing me. And, Linder, where did you develop that fear? When I saw the movie Us. - Then the Us trailer popped up... - Yeah.. - ...out of nowhere? - Out of nowhere. You did not ask for Jordan Peele's Us? Not at all. If you didn't know about Bloody Mary, and you didn't know about Momo, and you hadn't seen Babadook, and you had not seen Us by Jordan Peele, would you have any fears? Get Out. I like the movie Get Out. That's because it's also made by Jordan Peele, and falls in the floor, which is scary, and, like, tries to take the eyes and stuff, and it's really weird. It's also really good. You can do science in your own home, okay? Today, we're growing sweet potatoes in an egg carton cup using dirt and these sticks. Let's add the three-quarter cup of water that it says. All right. Evenly disperse. Then, without moving the sticks, lift your egg cup tray... Which-- Oh, this is-- Okay. I don't-- How married are we to doing this? - I don't care. - I don't want to. No, thanks. Um, Mom, can I get my water bottle? Did you hear what he said? That's funny. You hear what he said? He called me "Mom." That means you talk to your mom. He called Ms. Mulaney "Mom." No, you said-- You called me "Ms. Mulaney." Instead of "Mr." We call you "Ms. Mulaney" when you're in one of your moods. Sorry? Oh, what did Richard Kind call him the other day? - "Madam Secretary." - Oh. And when did Richard say that? On the group text. Oh, are you not...? No, I'm not on the group text. I thought he was the 323 number. That's Bo Burnham. I never added him. Zell, what's wrong? I was just wondering...

It was about a witch. She came to the house and, like, she made all the electric go away. She made it dark forever. And then, eventually, Tinkerbell came, and she turned on all the lights. Do you feel like there's a Tinkerbell in your real life who makes lights come on when things are scary? No, I think it was just in my nightmare. My bed has to be towards some kind of wall. So, like, if the wall's right here, and I'm sleeping here, I have to turn out this way so I can see the whole room. Because if I'm turning the other way, like, a demon will get you. Is that lore, or just you decided that? What's "lore"? How long have you been afraid of dying in your sleep? Probably about, like, one year. 'Cause then one day I just thought of it. Like, someone could rob your house, grab a knife, and then they-- I was like, "Oh my God. What if this happens to me?" This would just be so terrifying. But if you had a nightmare, what would you do? There is a little doll that I have named Little Witchy. She's been with me all my life. It's a little witch that's, like, this big. And I lay on my bed, and I hold her all the time. It makes me feel happy because I have comfort. And at this moment, we have matching pajamas that I wear not every night, because I got to wash my clothes, but I mostly wear them a lot to match with her, yeah. When I was a little kid, I would have nightmares where, like... they would, like, say my name, and then I would just get freaked out. Do you mind me asking who's "they"? I don't know, just like... random people. Yeah. What is it about hearing your name that seems... scary? It's just, like... I didn't know that bad dreams could know your name. Like, stuff like that. Welcome to Papier Maché Time. This is the hundredth episode. Today... we're gonna make something that, well, to be honest, is kind of upsetting to me. It's a volcano. Yeah, it's a volcano. And when I-- You kids don't know this, but when I was young, volcanoes made me really nervous. Where did you grow up? I grew up in Baltimore, and there's no volcanoes in Baltimore, but, somehow, I got it in my head that there could be an eruption. This is taking too long. Let's pour the vinegar in. I'm nervous! Everything's going to be fine, David Byrne. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Whoa! That is pretty cool. I told you. And you didn't believe me. And I'll never forget it. Oh, okay, I'm totally ashamed. It's okay. I forgive you. Thank you. This has been... Papier-Maché Time, episode 101. If you need more information, go to a library. Bye-bye. Bye-bye? Bye... Bye-- Bye-bye. Try to put this list of New York City mayors in order. No! No! No! Yeah! Uh-huh. That's correct. It's funny, what you said about Hawaii, do you know "mahalo," it means, like, many things, - it means "hello" and "goodbye." - I thought that was "aloha." Guess who I saw on the subway today? - Fran Lebowitz. - Yes. Oh, I didn't tell you about this sighting. Last June, I saw Paul Simon and Martin Scorsese at Coney Island. What were those two doing? They were stacked on each other's shoulders under a trench coat, trying to sneak on the Cyclone. - Did it work? - No, they got busted. 'Cause they made Paul the head, and he can't talk. So, inside the coat you just hear this chattering on about Federico Fellini. My top New York moment? I'm eating a slice of pizza at the Statue of Liberty. I walk around the corner and who do I see? All of the New York Yankees, and they're all singing "New York, New York." Only in New York! Hey, Alex, what's your top New York moment?

I'm so stupid. I stayed up late trying on clothes I already own, and I didn't prepare and I failed. Dad, I think that even though most of the things you did weren't audible, you're just trying to teach us that music can come from lots of things that aren't instruments. Yes... Yes! You see? You understood what I was trying to say. Music is more than just the songs you hear or people singing. Well, it's what you just-- You just said it better. Hey, Mr. Music. Mr. Music? What you did was really funny, watching you run around, when you were back over there especially. We want you to know that we don't judge you. We don't care. You don't care?

That's a picture wrap on Jake Gyllenhaal, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. No, no, I want this. I'm keeping this. - Very cool. - This is mine. My biggest fear is... losing my family or people I love. And right up there, right alongside of it, is losing my iPhone. What is the most scared you've been in New York City? I've almost never been scared in New York City. What about in Los Angeles? Every night in Los Angeles I'm afraid of Charles Manson. What is one of your biggest fears? The Purge, but not the movie, the theory. So, do you mean it's the plot of the movie The Purge-- - Yeah. Yeah. - Gotcha. Sometimes I, like, try not to fear, because I believe that God is always watching us, but something that, like... bothers me are, like, bugs. Riptides are my biggest fear because... they just-- they pull you under the water and then suck you out into the ocean. Fish, tacos, and fish tacos. Terrible. - We've got a surprise for you. - Can you bring in the clown? - No! No... - We would never-- We would never do that. - We're not licensed therapists. - Okay, good. Do you ever get nervous before you're acting? I don't have stage fright. I go on a stage and I say, "Oh, thank you. Thank you, everybody. Don't forget, um... you gotta believe." They brought us to our final callbacks and then they said, "Okay, we want me." And I don't even think we signed contracts. Uh, but still, we are doing the show. You haven't signed a contract? No. Oh. Do you have anything you wanna say to 20-year-old Isabella? Um, I would say to always be kind, Isabella. And get your Master's in dancing therapy, because you are always gonna help people who are in need. Like, even though if you're in a wheelchair, have a special disease, you are going to always help them and spread joy to all those people. My biggest fear is someone that I love dying a violent death, myself dying a violent death, and snakes. Can you very quickly describe your ideal funeral? Yes. I do want people to be very sad. Like, I don't like when they say, like, it's a celebration of life. "He or she would have wanted us to be happy." Like... You know that I want you to be happy, but I do want you to miss me. A lot. I would probably say just, like, losing the people that I love, because I'm, like, so close to a lot of the people, like my friends and family, and just to, like, not be able to see them would just be, like, really sad. Do you think about that more than you'd like to? Sometimes. Do you find a way to give yourself comfort? I give myself comfort about it by, like, just realizing that they're with me now, that I always have to make the best of it, because they're always gonna be there for me. Whether they are here or not, they're always gonna, like, be there inside my heart, you know? Is there a way of dying that you're not afraid of, that you would prefer? A way of dying I would enjoy...
