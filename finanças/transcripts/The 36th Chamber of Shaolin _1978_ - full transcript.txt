Since you are here... It means you've affinity with Buddha brother Abbot, you mustn't make exceptions he arrived here in a coma but woke up after 10 days perseverance to buddhism warrants his admittance Dharma also came to the east with such perseverance and laid the foundation of Shaolin what are your opinions, brothers? You're right, brother Abbot thank you Abbot Morning, sir morning, sir morning morning, sir morning San te, San te morning, Abbot how long have you been here? Over a year are you unable to endure destitution? No, not that, but... Don't hide anything from the Buddha before I came here, I heard Shaolin's the headquarters of kung fu but for the past year, I only cleaned I haven't seen any kung fu you can learn kung fu if you want to any monk here can learn among the 35 chambers as long as they want to if you don't tell us, who know you want to learn? Why do you want to learn kung fu? Honestly, Abbot before I came here, I saw the people oppressed by tyrannical rule if they are able to learn kung fu they could defend themselves and combat enemies. Therefore... Have mercy, San te Buddhists shouldn't bear such thought don't mention it again I won't be shaken and I won't mention it again no matter right or wrong Abbot can I still learn kung fu if I have such thought? There're 35 Shaolin martial arts chamber which chamber do you want to start? Which is the most advanced? The top chamber, of course then I'll start from the top Abbot behold, the Buddha says emptiness is the eternal five no sight, sound, smell, taste, sense the five flavours dull the taste the five tones deafen the ear the five colours blind the eye it can also not be seen but it won't pass away being at one is eternal but all things will come to you without wisdom... without... Leave no wisdom, no gain gaining is not continuant all men will come to me one for there lies rest and happiness and peace it's invisible and inaudible and it's inexhaustible can you hear the sound of bells? The heart is calm. We hear nothing How often do you recite the sutras? Go away Abbot, I came to learn martial arts get out Big brother, no one learns martial arts at the top chamber this is the most advanced field you won't understand big brother I'm willing to start from the bottom San te, cross the pond to enter dining hall yes Brother, this is the 35th chamber? Shut up. You starve if you're late Pure body is light, steps are stable don't enter the hall if you're dirty How dare you enter this dining hall? Abbot, I want to... Have congee? Come with me Stand on the wood jump turn around eat Get up, you're hopeless clean all the pottery and cutlery Wall is low, power of Buddha is high he's fallen into it don't laugh, he's only a novice enter the dining hall yes San te, you're terrific... Concentrate. You'll find a way keep practicing day and night. Go Stop wood drifts, its buoyancy is limited harder you step, faster it sinks San te yes throw the plate hard into water The plate sinks down in water just like the wood you stepped upon I keep the plate in motion, balanced similarly, step fast, balance body uniformity of mind brings uniformity of manoeuvre you must keep this point in mind Strength, balance, speed Strength, balance, speed. Right Abbot, I... Go I beg you to teach me, master 34th chamber is specialized to strengthen arms fist, palm, knife, sword, pole, spear all depend on arm strength. Look... This is the basic process carry the water up the slope pour it down to keep it flowing remember, arms must be straight you should carry water everyday to build up arm strength. Go now yes I didn't think you'd make it so soon San te, don't help others when they practice it'll only ruin them yes you've violated our rule. Leave... Abbot... Go! Go to the 33rd chamber thank you, Abbot this chamber is comparatively easier whenever you hear me knock the wood strike the gong Abbot, I'm here to learn kung fu, not... Don't misjudge the bamboo poles. Wisdom yes The hammer weighs 10 catties it is fitted into a 12-ft pole a 12-ft pole and 10-catty hammer now weighs 120 catties ho much can your wrists bear? I'm willing to try Now is 12-ft, add on 2 more feet Ready Keep practicing My respects to the Abbot you've left the wrist room? Yes, the Abbot said I could leave good. You have been working very hard since you joined as a reward for your diligence you'll be in charge of sutra room thank you, Abbot Brother Abbot, San te is ambitious he's not like our Buddhist brothers well, it's peaceful here in this temple but outside it's turbulent we may need someone like him Please guide me, Abbot Stand between the two burning incense yes Anyone practicing martial arts must be sharp-eyed. Watch the lamp When the lamp oscillates... Your eyes should follow but remember your head must not move. Start Told you not to move your head. Again Right, the target has disappeared but still, the eyes shouldn't move eyes be bright, limbs be nimble this is the way to do it yes turn around San te, hit the reflecting blocks Since I hosted here for 6 years, you're my most outstanding pupil thank you, Abbot "head chamber" Continue Don't lower your head. Stand up hands on your waist use your head to hit the sand bags then burn incense before the Buddha yes Again Get up Abbot, I... Collapsing so quickly? Get up now continue. Go on Abbot San te. If you have not gone thru two years of hard training you would not able to pass this alley San te, head is the most important part and it is also the last phase of training after going through it you can learn fighting and weapons Offer the incense Use your strength to hit it. Get up come on, get up You've set a new record. You've completed the 10 chambers and learned the basic skills in 25 months' time this is the first record ever happened in Shaolin I can't do it without the teachers as of now, you can select any chambers to learn fists sword, stick and other skills yes justice Abbot I'l make him head of Dharma house San te, greet these two heads yes Stop Continue San te "Leg chamber" Abbot San te, very good "Sword chamber" Turn around faster Good fellow San te San te, it's commendable of you to master all 35 chambers' kung fu in only 5 years now I'll make you deputy Abbot of any of the 35 chambers brother Abbot, San te's post is high enough as he's been promoted 8 times in 5 years with his present skill he's qualified to be deputy Abbot brother Abbot, Shaolin arts has existed for 1000 years we mustn't make a hasty decision in brother's opinion... Let him pick any weapon to fight with me if he succeeds, he can be an Abbot you heard what he said justice Abbot wants to compete with you what do you think? I dare not it's my idea. If you win you can take charge of any chamber excuse me then, justice Abbot Watch out Thank you, justice Abbot. I've lost you may challenge me any time San te, how many times have I tapped you? 17 times I could've hurt you with the blade You're right I'll continue with my practice Brother Abbot, I think he'll never win not really What weapon is San te using? A three-jointed bar made by himself Good, that move was not bad go on Abbot, are you alright? San te, I still have my weapon Excuse me brother Abbot San te can take charge of any chamber San te, choose to take charge of any of the 35 chambers except the top chamber. Your buddhism attainment is not advanced enough Abbot I've not yet made up my mind never mind. I'll give you 3 days thank you, Abbot there're only 35 chambers in Shaolin there isn't a 36th chamber I know. I'd like to create it this 36th chamber is... It's a pity Shaolin martial arts is confined solely to the temple it should be taught widely to all that's my idea for the new chamber to teach martial arts to laymen we don't involve in worldly affairs nor do we admit secular pupils forget it Abbot, this affects the handing down of Shaolin martial arts to posterity please let me enroll promising youths and train them in the 36th chamber nonsense, how dare you talk back? I don't mean to shut up! I must ask you to reconsider, Abbot justice Abbot yes our pupil San te should be punished yes San te, you've violated our rule you have to collect contributions don't return unless the book is full. Agree? Yes. Abbot, I deserve punishment leave tomorrow morning Master, you want to pray for chiang tai? They all died and they were buried in east cemetery go there and pray for them Uncle wei, may you rest in peace we will complete your mission hung hsi-kuan hung hsi-kuan, I knew you'd be here to bury your accomplices run go...
