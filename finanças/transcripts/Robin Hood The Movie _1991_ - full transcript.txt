Yeah, that's a good name! From now on you're gonna be called Fang, okay? (squeaking) (laughing) Listen, Marian. I think that your parent's castle is the first place Baron Alwine will go looking for you. Yes, you're probably right. I don't want to go back to Nottingham Castle, but I come from the Lancaster family. They're very powerful. They'll know how to protect me. Huh? I had no idea you came from such a respected family.

What do you mean by a strange man? Hm? Appearances can be deceptive! I've always lived on me own, but I'd be delighted if you were all to come and live here with me. What do you say? Well, what do you think, Robin? No, we can't. Thanks anyway. -Huh? -But Robin-- Listen, Baron Alwine and his men will come looking for us, and sooner or later, they're bound to come looking here. Then Friar Tuck will be arrested for sheltering outlaws. -Oh. -I understand. Thank you once again, Friar. We'll be on our way now and look for shelter in the forest. What will you do if you cannot find a safe place? Don't worry, Friar Tuck. We will. Assuming you find a safe place, can you build a shelter? Of course, we'll use branches and leaves! But what if a strong wind blows your shelter over? Uh, let's see-- Well, then we'd sleep outdoors! Hm, hm. You're a very smart boy, Robin. I think your friends are in safe hands. (chuckles) You know Sherwood Forest contains so many mysterious things that have never been explained. I could spend the rest of me life investigating the myths and legends of this wonderful place. Ah. Hm. ♪ A hippogriff runs in the sky, and from the stars of the universe dew drops fall to the trees in Sherwood and pixies come and play there. That's just kid's stuff, Friar! You don't really believe in that stuff, do you? Yes, Winifred, I really do believe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, come on.

I want to check the contents. ♪ Oh, if Alwine sees what's inside the box, the finger of suspicion will be pointed at me. I must stop him opening it at all costs. ♪ All right, let's see-- Wait, Baron, let me! This is my goddaughter's dress so I should look at it first! (laughs) -Wait, Bishop! -Hm? It is considered a bad omen for the godfather to see the dress before the ceremony. He is right, Hereford. But-- Mustn't tempt fate. So, Gilbert, have Lady Marian put the dress on and bring her here immediately. The Bishop would like to see her wearing it. Ah? Yes, My Lord. Baron Alwine, I appreciate your consideration of my desires, but I have a feeling you're up to something! Oh, Hereford, I am sure this will amuse you. I am setting a trap, you see, and for a trap you need a bait. But what do you hope to catch? In the castle, we have a problem with vermin. Young rats interested in freeing the girl. Yes, Baron, one must be strict with vermin! You can show no mercy! Bishop, there will be no mercy. (laughing) Am I going to have to live the rest of my life here as Hereford's goddaughter? There's surely no way I can escape this castle and go back to the forest. ♪ Where's that music coming from? It can't be! Yes! It's the same tune that Robin played to me that day in the forest. ♪ It was the most beautiful music I'd ever heard. I was so happy. I just wanted to stay there forever. ♪ Marian, I have something for you. What do you want, Gilbert? Please be strong. The night air is cold. You could become sick and this castle is no place for the unwell. How was the food I had specially prepared for you? You haven't touched it. I'll eat the same as Winifred. Now, why have you come? Your ceremonial gown has arrived from your family. Ceremonial gown? (gasps) Not this! ♪ This was-- This was my mother's silk wedding dress! Oh! ♪ What's that? (gasps) Shh, quiet. Oh. This is my father's knife. ♪ Nobody must know that I've seen this knife, Marian. Take it, keep it well hidden. ♪ Hm? Your parents sent this knife to you. You must decide how and when you need to use it. But why, Gilbert? Hereford wishes to see you in the ceremonial dress now. Why does a knight like you do such a thing? I'm no knight, just one of Baron Alwine's servants. But I can see you're different to him and his kind! I was, but now I am the same filthy breed as him. Huh? For now, though not for long. Hm. Nobody must know we spoke of this matter. Hereford is impatient, and I suggest you dress quickly! ♪ If she chooses to use the knife, I hope she picks her moment well. Now watch how a real man handles a rope! Yah! Hm. (grunts) Last one up's a sissy! ♪ Mm-hmm. Right, let's go! Wait a second, will ya? Hey, what are you two doing over there? Give him a break, he's got a cramp. Let him catch his breath before we move on! A cramp, I'll give him a cramp! Amateurs! It's okay, Robin, we better keep moving. Come on! Follow me! Stick near to the wall. -Okay. -Okay. ♪ (squawks) Oh! (groans) Who's there? Oh. (gasping) ♪ (meows) Just a cat, come on, boys. Phew. (squawks) There really is somebody there! Time we weren't here! After them! This nonsense about bad omens, how can you believe all those old wives' tales? I'm nearly 60 myself, and I wouldn't have become Bishop listening to such superstitious fancy. Sixty years of what? That's the question. Devotion, humility, and charity are all one needs to be Bishop, and he has none of them. Marian, my goddaughter-to-be, from every angle one can appreciate your obvious charms and--haha--your wealth. Now, let's have a little look at you. Coochie, coochie, coo! Gilbert, what's the matter with you? This business is of absolutely no concern to a knight of mine. Keep your nose out of it. Understand me? Use the knife, Marian. Baron, I must inform you that four young outlaws have succeeded in entering the castle! Huh? Hurray! -Oh. -Huh? Robin doesn't give up. Let me deal with 'em, sire. Calm down, will you? Those little fools won't succeed in their business because I planted a trap for them, Gilbert, and now we have just the right bait. Finally, I have found an excellent use for you, my dear, stubborn Marian. I hope you don't mean to use my goddaughter in your trap, it's unthinkable! Hold your tongue, Bishop! I'm in charge here. Am I not? Huh? You, Marian, came to my castle and offered yourself in exchange for Winifred, all rather tiresome. (grunting) There he is, up there! Whoa! Oh. He's up on the ramparts! Let's go!

Maid Marian is perfectly safe for now, which is more than I can say for you. Your precious Maid Marian is with Bishop Hereford! Louie. Marian! Robin! She's alive!

It's just an old log. ♪ ♪ Guess we missed him. Oh, well. ♪ And so, after a long and tiring swim, Robin, Will, and Little John had managed to escape from the Baron's guards, all thanks to a little invention that Much had come up with, not that he would let them forget it. It's simple, we do exactly what we did before! Straight up the castle walls. They won't expect it. We'll be out before they know what's hit 'em. The Baron's too smart for that. He'll have doubled the guards around the castle, especially after what happened yesterday. You don't know that! He might not expect us back so soon. We've already seen them! Oh. We have to find a way to get past the guards. So, my little caged bird is up to something, but what? Farewell, Gilbert. My concern for Maid Marian weighs heavy on my heart. I must keep an eye on her. ♪ Oh, Robin. (gasps) Hey! (cheering) He's very good, that guy! Probably the greatest alive. (clapping and cheering) Did you see that? -Very good! -Very good!

Do you think they might be looking for us? No, you're safe for now. They're here looking for their brides. What brides? Tomorrow, Bishop Hereford, minister of the Church of Nottingham, becomes godfather to a young lady of noble blood. We have to send four girls from this village up to the castle to become maids. But where do the brides come into all this? These girls know they will never be allowed to return to the village, never again set eyes on the men they have to leave behind. They have decided to marry so that no matter how far away they are, they will still be held together by the sacred bond of marriage, a bond that only God has the power to break. (weeping) Do not cry, this is a wedding day. It should be a celebration. Hereford must be stopped. -Hey, Robin! -Huh? We better make ourselves scarce! Come on, before they see us! Book it hard down that alley. Let's go! -Uh-huh! -Right. ♪ We're here to accept your gift of four village girls who are to have the honor of becoming maids to Bishop Hereford's new ward, Marian of Lancaster, so where are they?

So that's all the thanks we get, huh? We would have all been better off if you'd never shown up in the first place! Baron Alwine will now take it out on all of us. Well, fight back! You just don't understand. Great, so we can't get into the castle and the Baron knows where we're hiding out. Well, I'm having a great day. Anybody else, huh? So, what are we gonna do now?
