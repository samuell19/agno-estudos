You were sent to the principal's office? For bringing Mostafa's pic to class. It's not like he's your cousin! - I love him like family! Don't do it again. - I learnt my lesson. Let's post something. It takes a second. There's a comment under Mahnaz Afshar's post for her daughter's birthday. Let's leave a comment for Mostafa. You're all crazy! Celebrities don't read comments. She insanely reads all 6000 comments! - Yes I do. I went to the cinema before Taraneh Alidoosti's film was released! That's hilarious! And you're making fun of me? Look, they're divorced! Nice! He's single now. No, they were good together. Let's go to his page. How nice they looked together! He feels alone now! Poor guy! The girl says she feels free. How rude! Hello? Hi Dad, how are you? I'm out with the girls. Tell him you're with us. He trusts us. I'll take a picture and send you. I'll do it now, OK? Let's do a selfie. - Yes. Do it. Take a good one. What did he say? Let's go! Hurry up! The worst things always happen to me! What's wrong, Hasan? It's nothing. I lost 3 liters of blood! Hand me my glasses. Is there glass in the wound? Don't make a public scene. Who cares about these fools? What happened? - Doesn't concern you. What did I do now? Mr. Kasmai, what's wrong? - He cut his hand. Cut and burnt! Blood and blisters! Ouch! Be careful! Hasan! The reporter's waiting. Aren't you coming? Here all alone? Want your head chopped off too? Why not? He should hurry. Give me a cigarette. - My last one. What's wrong? He's a jerk. Who? - You know! Who? There are many jerks in there. Sohrab Saidi! Is he worth an hour of talk? An hour? Did I say something funny? - Am I laughing? Aren't you? He was telling me about his film. You call that filmmaking? What have we been doing together for the past decade? It was funny. My hand is bleeding, I'm out here alone, and you dare to say he's funny? What should I say? That it was boring? It was boring. - You're cruel. You don't care if I drop dead right here. It's a good role. He offered you a role? - Of course! Why else would I stand there for an hour? If I wait until you're allowed to work again, everyone will forget Shiva Mohajer. I've been shut down for two years and now you talk to that jerk? Shades at night in a gallery! Is he fucking blind? You keep asking me to wait, but I can't anymore. I'm bored. I'm tired of being alone and not working. Let me go. Dad! The reporter's still waiting! What's that supposed to mean? Go do your interview. Shiva, don't do this to me. Promise me. Go on. We'll talk later. He wants to start with Hatamikia's murder. I said it was too soon to judge, but he wasn't convinced. I didn't push. He shouldn't think we're avoiding it, but try to avoid it. He wants to ask you about being blacklisted. There's no evidence, so avoid that, too. That leaves nothing left to talk about! Stop sulking! It's better if you don't talk about the work ban. No one said I shouldn't talk about it. They think you know better. It's the New York Times. Let's go. Come on. He wants to ask you about the show. All the pieces are well-chosen and very appropriate. You can't say that! So exactly what should I say? Say you find sadness in all things. And see everything as unfortunate. And? - That's it. He'll ask about your next film. Miss Kasmai? - Coming! Hold on. Mr. Kasmai, it's an honor. May I? Of course. I love your films. I watch "Rendezvous in the Slaughterhouse" every week. Ms. Mohajer is lucky you love her so much. I mean you love her work. - All done? Yes. - Thanks. Stay focused. Or do you want two more years of shooting commercials? - OK, I know. Sohrab Saidi's going to be in the interview too. Are you kidding? No way! Seriously? Love. Definitely love. Their love of art and beauty. Love of light and movement. Love of love. Love of life, and, of course, death. I think murder of an artist is murder of love. Love in our lifetime is like a bird... - No, sir! These people simply hate us! Oh my God! Mani Haghighi's been murdered too! Hasan! We're on our way. Don't worry. There's no traffic. He must be identified by someone who knew him. Don't go in alone. Wait for us. We were out when we heard. We're coming. Don't worry. I couldn't reach him. I left a message, but no news. He should be reachable non-stop. What do you mean? What if I'm attacked? Security only during working hours? We'll somehow manage tonight. But it's better to send some guys. That idiot bodyguard says: "Just be careful." I'm sorry to meet you under such unfortunate circumstances. - Yes, unfortunate. Excuse me, doctor, I never identified a body before. Technically it isn't a body. It's only his head. Sadly, they haven't found the rest of him yet. Doctor? A gentleman wants to see you. - Who? The man from... Please wait inside. I'll be right back. Mom! Grandma! (Turkish) What happened? - What are you doing? I've had enough for one night! Have you heard the news? - Mom, put that down. Have you heard the news? - Yes. We were at the hospital. Did you go there for your head? - No, I fell there. Were you attacked? - No! Put that down! Don't yell at your mother! - Where did she get that gun? She asked where you got the gun. - It's mine. She says it's hers. Yours? Tell her guns aren't allowed in my house. She says guns aren't allowed in her house. It's not a gun, it's Sattar Khan's rifle. What is she talking about? - It's not a gun. It's Sattar Khan's rifle. Really? - That's what she says. Has she taken her pills? - Mom, have you taken your pills? - I don't know. Alma, check if she took her pills. Hasan, you must be careful. It's you who should be careful. Lower the gun. Is it loaded? - Of course it is. I'd be crazy to stand here with an unloaded gun. What does she mean? It's not loaded. - Stop lying. It's loaded. It really belonged to Sattar Khan? An antique. It can't work. You think it doesn't work? I can show you! I can't live like this anymore. - Then don't. She's just scared. - Dad? Dad! I think I fucked up.

He will forever remain with us. Jerk! Thinks he's one of us. Tell me about it. - It's a circus. Any idiot who comes along... They say he has a new project. He wants to cast Shiva. That's what I heard. I'm surprised by Farideh. She's agreed to produce his film. Farideh? Really? - So I heard. Who am I speaking of? You... who were green and sensual, whose delicate thoughts were long and narrow like a reed... May I? Hello. You're out alone? Would my head be safer with Goli? You should be careful. Things are really bad. Worse than this? - Sure. Let them chop off our heads and free us of this madness. Don't say that! They'll issue a permit soon for your film. What permit? Haghighi's head was chopped off and thrown in the gutter. Nothing happened! How can I hope for a permit? You shouldn't lose hope. Don't give up! You should give up, too. - What? We must stand strong. - We must sit! That's how to protest. Stop making films. That's it! Let's all hold hands and sit! We were about to invite Shiva to join us. We're here to bury Mani's head and you're talking about filming? Lights, camera, action? You think that's right? No, but... - Shut that film down! I expected more of you. I was stunned when I heard. Think how history will judge you. Shut down. Shut it down. God help us. Don't be alarmed. Did you take the bus over? I'll drive you back. And you are? You can smoke if you want. I quit. This new freeway makes driving to the cemetery easy. Half an hour. It seems we'll be going there more often. You think they're connected? The murders? The deaths. Deaths? My friend's head was chopped off and left in the street. The other one's was tossed in a playground. A kid found it when he went to pee behind a tree. We can't call those murders? - I feel bad for that kid. What about the guys without heads? The kid's still alive. - So, are they connected? How should I know? It's your job. - I want your opinion. There's a ton of crazies here. Who was that guy? The Night Bat, remember? Open the glove compartment. The glove compartment. The envelope. Open it. It's Hamid! Same word on their foreheads. Same carving, same size. Look closely. - I can't. OK, fine. "Pig"? Why? I thought you might know. A chopped off head with "Pig" carved on its forehead! How should I know? You don't? - No. I don't. Cut! Perfect. Play it back, let me check. What was perfect about it? Miss Kasmai? Come here, please. Yaser! Yaser! - Yes, sir! Where's my cellphone? - You didn't give it to me. It's not here. Tell them I'll be late for tennis. - Yes, sir. Alma, my phone is missing. - Just a minute. OK... We'll do the next take tighter, with a 65mm lens. Excuse me? Do I have to puke again? - Yes. Who let you in here? - Your daughter tested me. You did a test for my daughter? - Can you ask them to sweeten the puke a bit? How many times do I have to tell you... - I thought directors had it rough, but just look at me! - I'm not into these games. I'm too old. I don't get it... - Yaser? Yaser? Can you put some sweetener, not sugar, diet sweetener... - You're my daughter's age. What's with your bad mood? You should admire my persistence. - Persistence? It's called stalking! From the gallery to the cemetery! - See? See how I feel? Get up. - Now? Like this? Aren't you doing another take? You really want me to leave? Ask them to bring some sweetener! I have a nasty taste in my mouth. Here, try it yourself. No thanks. Yaser! - Yes, sir? Ask them to bring some sweetener. The puke tastes bad. It won't turn solid with sugar. - Not real sugar, artificial. - It should turn solid. We tried. We added sugar, and it turned soft and white. What about salt? - Salt? It turns pink with salt. I swear, it turned pink. - What junk are you feeding me? It turns white with sugar and pink with salt? - It's made in Austria and costs a fortune. The vomit's made in Austria? - Yes. Dad! Come here. She's making a scene. - Where's my phone? We didn't let the agent in yesterday, so the boss is here now. Send her away. - I can't. They own the place. What does she want? - She says it's too violent. A pesticide commercial should be about death! You promised a musical. Yesterday 300 roaches were dancing around! That's moving in unison, not dance. - Come on! And they're not roaches. They are domestic insects. "Domestic insects will move in unison when a cloud of spray puts them to sleep." We say sleep, not death. - Oh God! Excuse me, Mr. Kasmai, this is not working out. Sorry, please give us a moment. How much longer must I wait? You're not making a feature film! My phone! I'm late. Check the iPad and find my phone. Have you ever seen a cockroach vomit blue jelly? Kids will pee their beds in fright! - Ma'am, I haven't made this up! It says right here! "Flammable, etc. They ooze a blue liquid." What does this mean exactly? I tried it. The roach oozed a blue liquid, and popped like popcorn. - "Heated corn kernels". It's not working. Shut down. We need a meeting. Have your meeting. I'll play tennis. Tennis? With a racquet and balls! She can explain. I can explain. - No, don't explain! Ma'am, this is what I've made. Take it or leave it. Goodbye. Pardon me? - I'm sorry. You own this place. I'm firing myself! Check the contract if I can. - I'm checking. I found your cellphone. Whose purse is this? Whose purse is this? No takers? Ms. Mohadeseh Nosrati! Mr. Kasmai! Just a minute, please. I can call the police. - I didn't mean to steal it. I was going to look at your photos, then return it. Do I look like an idiot? No! What a thing to say! You don't understand how I feel about you. Be grateful I called off my daughter. - I'm very grateful. Try showing it! I don't want you around me. Get out. - I swear I'm not a thief. It's because of how I feel for you. Wait! Your films are like poetry to me. "Rendezvous in the Slaughterhouse" is... Can I drive you to tennis and explain? What for? I have a car. Your wife has the car on Tuesdays. Isn't it better going together instead of using production transport? Give me a few minutes. I promise not to bother you again. You can even call the cops if you want. Leave me like this and I'll be back. I can't help it. - Are you on drugs? I'm not going to eat you! I just want to give you a ride. Can you wait a couple minutes while I change? OK. - Thanks! You identified him? You had to look? - I tried. Were his eyes open? - It was as if he was identifying me. Are we in a rush? - I'm worried you'll be late like last week when Mr. Ghoncheh left. Can't I? Instead of Shiva Mohajer? Can't you what? - Act in your film. There is no film. Cast me instead. Things may work out. I don't even have a permit. I'm blacklisted. Shiva Mohajer isn't blacklisted. She can't wait around hoping something happens for you. She's going to work with him. She will never! I don't know why I'm discussing this with you. I don't even know your name. Mohadeseh? - I'm Annie. But... Ms. Mohajer signed a contract with Mr. Saidi. Only gossip! - Saidi was there yesterday. You're lying. Doesn't she live in the Iran Sokna Residence? - Yes. I saw Saidi myself. He walked past me to her apartment. Liar! - No! I couldn't take a photo, but I will next time. What are you trying to do? Fine. I did take a picture. - Really? I care for you so much. I respect you so much. I know I shouldn't, but... - Show me! You're angry. - Show me! Iran Sokna! What about tennis? - Turn around! Iran Sokna! Hurry up! Shiva! Shiva! Shiva Mohajer! Shiva! This is a family place. - It's a dump! A real dump! And we're all animals! Shiva! Hasan! - Is it true? What are you doing here? - Is it true? What? Shush, people will talk. - Don't shush me! Those "people" don't exist! Answer me! Step aside. What's this? - Give it back. Stop playing around. What is it? - It's a script. "A pause pregnant with ambiguity..." "Pregnant with ambiguity"? Are you kidding me? "If you wish to see the world beyond the gates of death, then look around." That's my line! - It's an old Chinese saying. I taught you that old Chinese saying! Now it's in that jerk's script! I might have mentioned it once... You blurted it out and he defecated it on his script! Why do you keep shushing me? Is someone in there? - Don't be like this. You have company? Is that jerk here? Who's there? - Everyone! They're all here. We're reading the script! Yaser? Was that Yaser? - Hasan, you're blacklisted. People need to make a living. To hell with other people! Shiva! What have you done to me? Hasan... go home and relax. I won't relax! I'll be back with axes and bullets! I'll kill you, then that jerk Saidi! Then that bitch producer who enslaves you all! And then I'll kill myself for wasting my life on you! Who gets you this stuff? Farzaneh, of course. She still works at the hospital? - Definitely! How's your Mom? - She won't take her meds, gets confused and forgets everything. Lucky lady! I envy her. And how are you? - Haven't you heard the news? I hate news. - The rumors. Ever since I retired... - You didn't retire. The hospital fired you. Was that necessary? - Friendly reminder! Someone's running around, killing our filmmakers. Is that funny? He hasn't gotten you. - He clearly has no idea who is who. He murdered some irrelevant nobodies. No criteria, no barometer... no sense of stature... I just don't get it! Want to try some? "The Age of Space Travel" Hasan, darling. - Mom. What's wrong, sweetie? What's wrong? Nothing. Please don't cry, baby. I can't stand seeing your tears. Has someone broken your heart? Who dared do such a thing? Everyone. Everyone? Who the hell is everyone? I'll kill them all. Each and every one, if you want. Sure, why not. Won't you tell me what's wrong? Shiva left me. How dare she? She should run after you like a grateful puppy. Goli doesn't love me anymore. She'll never find anyone better than you! Alma's grown up and I can't hug and kiss her like before. I'll hug and kiss you! I'll take care of you, my love! I'm not dead yet! And some bastard is killing all my friends. They still haven't caught him? Not yet. Stay at home for a few days. He won't dare come around here. Don't worry. I'm here to care for my darling son! Mom? Why won't he come after me? Who? - The killer. I would be respected if he killed me. I'm better than those other directors. Hasan, darling... - What do they have that I don't? Nothing, dear. - So why won't he come after me? Don't worry. He will! Really? - Of course, he'll come after you. And your mother will get him! My reputation is being destroyed. I know, sweetie. No matter what, he should have come for me first! Don't worry. The killer will come after you. I promise you. He's saving the best for last! He'll come after you... I went to the desert, aimlessly. I journeyed, I observed. I stared without seeing. My gaze travelled, it rested upon light. Nothing to see... but light! All infused by empty light. My breath flew past light. Breath turned to blood, light blossomed in my throat. I leapt and raised my voice, "Oh, Cupbearer... I wish to see." I have no words to call your name. Leave me not in fear. When I depart for the other world, oh Cupbearer, what will happen to my land without me? If you wish to see the world beyond the gates of death, then look around you now. Hasan! Sorry. - Cut! Bring me down. Careful with the costume! Her master's here. - That's no way to talk! Get the hook off the costume. Hasan! Hasan! Come out! I see you! What are you doing here? - Shiva, no... You're spying on me? - Shiva, not here. What are you wearing? You're asking me? - Answer me! Mr. Kasmai! I'm a big fan. How about a selfie? I'll be quick. - Please, give us a minute. You heard her. Go away. Mr. Kasmai, please join us. - You shut up! You're so rude! More important people visit this set every day. Not more than me. Get lost! What a prick! - Mr. Kasmai? The prick you want a selfie with! Sohrab, darling, just a minute. "Darling"? He used to be Mr. Saidi. Now he's "Sohrab, darling"? What's going on? Hasan, darling! - Coming, Sohrab, darling! Are you deaf? - Enough already! Take your photo. Thanks. Can you be in it too? - Sure. Do you feel uncomfortable? - I always do. Mr. Saidi would like you to direct this shot. - What are you saying? I'm blacklisted. It's only one shot. - Take our photo first. Hasan, get off your high horse, let's work side-by-side! What did he say? - See what you've done? What do I do now? I came to check on you, not to make a fuss. - You ruined the take. It was ruined from the start. One... He really told me: "Get off your high horse"? Two... - God save us! - Three! "Anarchist Director Strikes Again!" You went to Shiva's set? The news is everywhere. - I didn't want her to mess up in that idiot's film. You went to direct Saidi's film? Did you yell at her again? No. When have I ever yelled? - That night at the gallery. Everyone will find out. We already discussed this. We agreed on certain things, defined boundaries, our behavior in front of others, all that. Have I ever been indiscreet? - No, you've been perfect. - You can be perfect, too. Lower the flame to keep it burning. OK. - Good! Hasan! Force is good, focus is good. But you're playing with me. We're here to chillax and be friendly. I can't be friendly, Homayun. What does that mean? - I just can't! Just play. I can leave, if you want. Come over here. - No! Serve! Go on, serve! - Don't yell. Come here and talk. I'm not here to talk. I came to play tennis. Go on. - I'm asking you to come here! Don't play psychiatrist! You're not even a doctor anymore! - I'm your friend. Your only friend. Then serve if you're my friend! I have this event tonight. Want to come along? Sir? Your medals are fake, Mr. Reza. Everything about me is fake. My apologies. - Forget it. Apologies, sir. You should be ashamed. So glad you could make it. - How could I not? Where's Farzaneh? - Night shift. So who did you bring? - I brought Hasan Kasmai. He was feeling down. Please have your people tend to him. - Ladies! Mr. Kasmai! What an unexpected pleasure! I'm not Kasmai. - Don't tease! Kasmai's been murdered. I'm disguised as him. Seriously? Pull on my beard and see. It will come off. Can I really? - Sure. Jerk! The jerk's house. Saidi. Who's Saidi? - The guy making a film with Shiva. Oh, that guy and Shiva...! Think Shiva's there now? - Shut up! It's just a question. - Of course not! I'm sure she's not. Of course not. Hopefully not. But what if she is? How can we be sure? Is there any other way? No, don't even think about it. - Why not? Don't even think it! Seriously? There's a dog! - Don't worry. It's chained. What's the point of a chained dog? That idiot! Let's go. She's not here. Who? Shiva. Let's go. - Come on. What's wrong? - Smell! What smell? It's Shiva's perfume. - You're kidding! She's here! - Wait. Shiva! - Hasan, wait. Hasan! It's OK! Everything's fine! What's OK? Are you blind? Someone chopped off his head! How can you say everything's fine? Don't shush me! Homayun! He had no head! - I saw, too! But it's over. It's like a nightmare. You'll be with your wife and mom soon! Mommy! Mommy! Mom, you almost scared me to death! What's wrong? Nothing. You've been staring at the wall all day! Hasan, what's wrong? Sohrab Saidi's head was cut off. The director who's banging Shiva? Did I ever say that? Stop fooling yourself. Why don't you sit down? Tell me what's wrong. - I told you already! Sohrab Saidi was killed! I saw him myself! - I'm glad he's dead. Mom! - Destiny smiled upon you! The film is cancelled. And the girl will come back to you. It's Shiva. If only everyone was as lucky as you. Shiva? Why are you crying? What? Who told you? Stop crying. I'm coming over. Shiva? - I'm here. What are you doing here? What took you so long? Why are you sitting in the dark? I'm afraid to stay home. Do they know who did it? I asked. They didn't answer. Who did you ask? The investigators. They came by this afternoon. They gave me the news. What did they want? They asked when I saw him last, who his enemies were. - Enemies? Don't worry. They didn't mention you. What do you mean? I mean they didn't mention you. It happens sometimes that you are not mentioned. Not a mention? - No. Nothing at all? Like what? - Did they ask where you were that night? Me? Were you there? There? - There. At Saidi's place. Briefly, in the early evening. Briefly? After driving all that way? He wanted to see me. What time in the early evening? Are you interrogating me? - What time? 8 or 8:30. Until around 9:15. Your perfume still lingered in the air at 4 AM. How do you know? - I was there. I went to see if you were there. Sit down. - Stop it! I saw his body. There was blood everywhere. I smelled your perfume. What have you done? - You're asking me? You went to his house at 4 AM. - Yes! He wanted to meet. He was anxious. I went to encourage him, then went home. Why are you looking at me like that? How did you get into his house? - I jumped over the wall. I jumped a wall for you! That's how it is! This is what I've become! Nothing happened. I had coffee and went home. I called, but you didn't answer. Won't you ever let go? I can't let you go. Can't you understand? I can. So don't let me go, OK? Hi. - Hello! How are you? - Great! Hi. - Mr. Kasmai! How are you? Mr. Saidi's death makes us worry for you. No one takes me seriously anymore. Younger directors are the targets. But your films... - Anything to serve the public. Is Homayun here? - No, and his cell is off. He probably overslept. We overdid it last night. - Naughty boys! We were out all night. If you see him, tell him to call. I have the day off. Everyday, in fact! Annie? Annie? Where are you? Don't be mad. Hey! - What? It's just a video. Can I upload it? - What? Let's go viral! - Put that away. Your followers will double in half an hour. What followers? I'm 50. No thanks! Your wife doesn't have Instagram. - You talk as if you're a relative. Think she has a fake profile? Fake profile? That's not the issue. Is Shiva the issue? - What about Shiva? Nothing is going on between you and me. Shiva and my wife won't think anything. I'm here for a few minutes of peace. What you're thinking is logically impossible. Everyone says it's over between you and Shiva. Over? My life is as complicated as everyone else's. It can't be summarized in one word. It's all gossip. Gossip is what matters. Who cares about the truth? Listen to yourself! Who are those guys? Mr. Kasmai? - Yes. Please come with us. - What? Ouch! My dear Mr. Kasmai. What happened to your eye? - It's nothing. Was it our guys? - No. I was stung by a bee. A bee? Really? The damn thing picked a terrible time. There's no convenient time to have a flat tire. It's a saying. I mean there's never a good time to get stung. By a bee. Yes. - It's always bad timing. That's right. - No one says, "Lucky I got stung at this moment." I understand what you mean. The knife! I have melon but forgot the knife. No need. I can use my hands. - I'll get one. Mr. Azemat, there's no need. You brought me here for no reason. I was in a boat at the lake. Your friends... Let's have some melon. We'll clear everything up. It's a bad time to get arrested. - Arrested? You can hardly call this an arrest. Not an arrest? I was at the lake and now I'm here. They blindfolded me! I'll get ointment for your eye. - Please, it's not necessary! A knife and some ointment. - Mr. Azemat! This ointment works miracles. My brother-in-law brought it from Shanghai. So... let's have some melon and get to the point. Let's skip the melon and get to the point because I have a lot to do. You must be patient. We have a lot to do, too. I'm patient, but... - Very well. Let's get to the point so we don't take up your time. Look at this. Are you saying you don't know where that is? I don't know the address. It was nighttime. - Nighttime. Yes, I went there with a friend. Were you driving? Yes, it was my car. It was nighttime. He gave me directions. So you didn't know the hostess? Not at all. I have no idea who she is. Is that her? Yes, I think so. How late did you stay? I can't remember. It was late... 5 AM? - 5 AM. And then? - Then? Then. - Then when? After the party. Well, one usually goes home after a party. You went home after the party? Definitely. - Excuse me? Definitely. - Definitely. Have some melon. What's that? Keep watching. It gets very interesting. When reason incarcerated me... I was abandoned by friends and foe alike. I was crushed by art's curse! Where men are all female and women are male... Save me from this endless fear, this feeling of infinite descent! Save me from this endless fear, this feeling of infinite descent! Death calls! - The gates of hell are open! The gates of hell are open! Are you OK? Your eye is better. The good news is you can go home. We received a letter from someone claiming to be the murderer. He drew our attention to a part of the video showing him at Mr. Saidi's house. That same night. Your image was so pronounced that we missed him. The Pig was there? You walked right by him. He sent a letter and confessed? He's proud of his work. He's upset I got the credit. And the bad news? My condolences. This is a tranquilizer my mother brought from... Take one. Hasan, sweetheart, it was just a dream. No, it wasn't. It wasn't a dream. - Have some water. Goli, I was in the desert. What desert? They brought you straight back. They are outside. You were dreaming. Did I dream about Shiva, too? Goli, was that a dream? No... Homayun is outside. Should I get him? Her lifeless body was found this morning in an abandoned area in northern Tehran. She had been decapitated. Renowned director Hasan Kasmai has not been seen in public recently. His family has avoided... Give it back! I want to know. - Don't bother. You already know everything. But he doesn't know. - He does. Hi. - Know what? You know. What do I know? What don't I know? - Nothing. Why do you look like that? What did they do? The same thing they did to you. Goli, it's best to tell him sooner. Hello, Mrs. Kasmai. Hello, Homayun. Hasan, darling. Are you OK? Did they hurt you? No, Mom, they didn't. I just missed you. Sweetie! Always so sweet. Forever my darling baby boy! It's that producer. - Farideh? Oh-oh! Should I open the door? Yes. What's going on? Is your dad home? - Yes, he's inside. Hello. - Hello. Can you explain? - It's fake, a disinformation. He hasn't even seen it. - Why don't you tell me what's going on here? You should tell us. - Nothing! It's a lie! And you are? - Mr. Ghoncheh, family friend. What have I done? Someone tell me! This has gone viral online. I won't rest! I'll be back with axes and bullets! I'll kill you, then that jerk Saidi! Then that bitch producer who enslaves you all. Then I'll kill myself for wasting my life on you! I blurted that out in anger. So what? Two of them are dead. Will I be next? Annie took this video. - Really? - Who's Annie? You did her screen test? - Yes. Her address must be on record. - Hasan, who's Annie? Let me go, bastard! - Quiet! Let me go! - I said quiet! Quiet! Don't be afraid. See? My hands are empty. What do you want? - Did you make that video? Which video? - That video! - Which video? I'm no idiot! I'm a filmmaker. I know camera angles! You were standing there! I didn't do it. - Stop lying! I didn't do it. - I saw you standing in that corridor. What are you doing to me? What am I doing to you? Was it my fault when Haghighi's head was rolling in the gutter? Or when they found Shiva's head in a dumpster? You were with me when I was arrested. I was in jail when Shiva was killed. - Why would they suddenly come to the lake to arrest Hasan Kasmai? They had some reason. What's that supposed to mean? - People need to know. Know what? - The truth! Do you know the truth? What do you want with me? I was in solitary confinement. You saw those two thugs yourself. Maybe they were your cohorts. You ruined my life. Annie, you ruined my life. Hasan, were you really arrested? Please erase it. Just erase it. It went viral already. 1.7 million views! Then deny it. Tell them where I really was. Nobody knows who I am. Even if the police deny it, no one would believe them. I haven't done anything wrong! I haven't done anything wrong. He's lying like a dog. Like a dog! I want to ask you, where's the truth in the whimpering of this affluent man? What explanation can Mr. Kasmai possibly give? To avoid handing himself over to the police, or better yet, drinking hemlock to end it all. But first, he must confess to murdering our great artists. Then he must accept his punishment. The brave people of this land must know that Hasan is a killer. Remember this hashtag. We are nothing... Just a gaze! Hello. I offer my condolences. I want to explain something. Even though I don't know why I need to explain this, nor to whom. I don't know you, I don't understand you. I don't feel any responsibility to offer an explanation. But my explanation is this: I am not a murderer. The night Shiva was murdered I was detained, under police supervision. I was released when they realized their mistake. Please comprehend this: I was released when they realized their mistake. Now you're making a mistake. I'm unsure of your numbers, nor how loud your voice is, nor how powerful you are. I just know that you are accusing me. A baseless, unfounded accusation. You should be ashamed. "Killer" Don't worry about it. We've detained her. Who? - Annie Nosrati. Her name is Mohadeseh but she goes by Annie. What do you want with her? - Don't worry. Everything's OK. She needed to understand. She had some videos of you. We took her in to explain things. Is she alive? - I hope so. You need to arrest those who write these things. It's probably one of Jhila Bayrami's followers. Who the hell is Jhila Bayrami? Hasan is a killer! He says he was in jail last Friday night. What does that mean? Anyone can hide in his home, do whatever he pleases, kill people and cut off their heads, and then claim to be detained. Where? For what crime? Mr. Kasmai, pay attention if you're watching! We are tireless. Say where you were on the night of August 3. And the week before that, when Sohrab Saidi's head was being chopped off. Where were you? At a "Rendezvous at the Slaughterhouse"? As long as you don't explain these things, we will consider you a murderer. A killer! You are a killer! Hasan is a killer! See what you've done? It's nothing. Don't take it seriously. - Shouldn't I? You detained me based on hearsay. Then you realized you made a mistake, and without an apology, you dumped me in the desert. We left you in the desert? Oh no, that was a dream. But anyway... - Would you like some water? No, thank you. - It's cold. What's in it? - Water. No, thanks. Why won't you announce that I was in custody that night? - You already did that. No one will believe me! - Will they believe us? Everyone thinks I cut off Shiva's head! We don't consider you a suspect. They held an unofficial trial! I was unjustly tried and convicted. Now they want to see me hanged. You shouldn't stress yourself out over some crazy Twitter trolls. Stressed out is my normal nature! Hasan, come here. - Mom, not now. I said come here! Mom, they think I'm a murderer. To hell with them! I don't know what to do anymore. Don't go barefoot in the street. Fine, but they will still think I'm a murderer even if I wear socks and shoes. It's time to show your character! Mom, I'm so lost. A man can move mountains if he stands tall and looks people in the eye. Today is Shiva's memorial service. I ironed your shirt. It's in the closet. To hell with what people say! Welcome to our program. Tonight we'll discuss the events at Shiva Mohajer's memorial service. As everyone knows, Hasan Kasmai attended the service despite having been accused on social media of murdering Ms. Mohajer. The director was attacked by a group of mourners. A violent scuffle quickly ensued. One of our listeners, Nazanin, is on the line. What is your reaction to Hasan Kasmai's violent behavior? Hi. I think it's impossible to claim to be an intellectual or an artist while behaving so despicably at the same time. There should be a difference between an artist and a thug. This behavior is completely inappropriate. I think this will lead to confirmation of all the rumors circulating about him in social media. If a person is capable of such violence, then he could be capable of murdering Shiva Mohajer as well. Shiva! Hasan! Everything's falling apart. You must do something. Like what? They won't stop until they rip you apart. More than they have? Look at me. Much worse. They want you dead. The killer won't come for me. I've been waiting. What should I do? If you die, they'll feel sorry for you. It's painful. But it's over in an instant. Then we'll be together. Don't you miss me? Oh Shiva, so much! - Come to me. Come! Come! Come! Come! Explain it one more time. I didn't understand the last part. You don't need to understand. Just do what I ask you. But you mentioned Shiva. - Forget that. I didn't understand either. You said Shiva controlled your mind and ordered you... She said something, but I have a different plan. So, they'll find me here. Like the killer has strapped me and tied me to this column. Then you show up, scare him and he runs away. Me, scare him? - Sure. You'll look like a hero, and I'll be very grateful. You're welcome. - Not yet! After people show up. Pay attention! - I'm paying attention. Do I tie you up now? No, first you beat me up. Hit me. It must look real to people. In the face... I've never hit anyone in my life. - Just a little punch will do. Can't we find a more peaceful solution? We're talking about my dignity here. This jerk must kill me whether he wants to or not! - Got it! Go on. What? Tie me up. - Come on, what's the point? Now what? - The cutter. What for? - Bring me the bag. Gag me and tape my mouth. Take the cutter and carve "Pig" on my forehead. Hasan... - Do it! Pig! A decree was issued, engraved in blood: The pig's brow must be carved... And a mirror placed before him... The pig shall see a pig. Perhaps love will then be cleansed of sin... The sin that is you, Pig! And the Pig shall be no longer! And the Pig shall be no longer! And the Pig shall be no longer! Hasan! What are you saying? With the cutter? Don't untie me. - Why not? Take a photo. What? - A photo for Instagram so people can see. You want me to upload this to your Instagram account? There's no reception here. Your password? What's your password? "Darling Goli". Ask people to come! Send a GPS location. The first like! "Thumbs up to your courage, brave Iranian man!" - A heart emoji. "We're coming to kiss you, hero!" They call you a hero! "You're the country's pride." - 130 likes! 203 likes! - Mom, how did you know I was here? Shiva told me. What do you want? They are going to cut off your son's head! I don't speak your language. Kasmai, you're our hero! Listen! They came! Fucking idiots!
