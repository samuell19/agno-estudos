Dandelion is a very beautiful flower. Enriched in vitamins and pharmacological properties, it's highly consumable and has been used to make a variety of delicacies and medicines since the old days. In the world of showbiz, every singer wants to have a live show. Same for me. I mean... It's not to show off. It's simply because... I just want to sing. I like to sing. I'm loving it! In that live show, I'd sing all my favorite songs from when I was a kid. Actually, I’m going to have a live show soon... made for me by my closest companions. However... there’s someone... who is strongly against it. I am... very, very confident that my voice... can conquer the pickiest audience! But... nobody seems to care about my voice! Oh, my gosh! He is too good to be true! Because my pretty face got them losing their mind! ME: HANDSOME, MELOPHILE, LOVE MY MOM SO MUCH This showman is a cash machine! Since he became my manager, I’ve become hugely popular! I've got new shows every single day! Don’t let his flashy look fool you. He’s a die-hard! Same hair color for ten years! - No. - See? I knew it! The poor hairstylist! LAM: PROFESSIONAL, CONSERVATIVE, LOVES MONEY It’s a commercial break. Later, we’ll be back with a special guest, a very handsome singer: Dinh Phong. And next to me is Pham Quynh Bang! Hello, Phong! Uh... Hi, sis! Actually, I'm "Bang Bang". Yes. My real name is Pham Quynh Bang, but Fan Bingbing is my idol, so... Not to mention I hate growing old. I want to be young and pretty as Bingbing forever. So I chose my stage name as Pham Bang Bang. - Very nice to see you today. - Thank you. This lady fears nothing but aging. She's the second oldest in my group! On the radio, she's a love guru, but in real life, she's "utterly single". QUYNH BANG: FEARS NOTHING BUT AGING! Do you remember everything I've taught you? Yes, we do! Very well. Off I go. Alakazam! Hey. Hey! It's stuck! Hold on! I almost forgot. But what is it that I forgot? Oh... I just realized... that I'd... better walk. Hey, the Fairy Godfather is wearing Adidas shoes! This is my best companion! KIEN HA: TV HOST, LOVED BY KIDS When I was still at school, I hated learning English the most! I only loved my mother tongue! Ouch! It hurts! Gosh! I’m fine. No worries! Why are you doing this? Don't you see the people playing around? Here, and there... But as they say, "God gives him what he hates." And if my life is a bowl of soup, it undoubtedly needs a little pepper to complete the flavor. A worthy rival, for instance. Of course, not this guy! Look at him. Dinh Phong! There he is, wearing his stupid shaggy coat! What a face! Gosh, I hate this guy so much! He's my junior but he's way too cocky! Unacceptable! And every time we meet, he has to shove me once real hard! That hurts, you know. - I’m not your usual guy - Not usual, not usual - I’m not your usual guy - Not usual, not usual Hey, hey. Hey, man! You delayed your performance to throw Kiet off, right? You’re more cunning than you look! Even if I didn’t do it, you know he could never be in the same, same, same league as me! Moreover, he came to the show late. I performed first. Of course, he'd be under pressure! I'm Dinh Phong, remember? - I’m not your usual guy - Not usual, not usual Yeah! We made lots of money tonight! Oh, oh! Just keep on driving, bro. Here we are! Wow! It’s "snail heaven"! Jeez, I’m not dressed up fabulously just for street food! Clams. Snails. Cockles. Squids! - Where are the squids? - Here’s yours. No. Please keep it. We have so many things to pay for. Please keep it. Come on! I see. Snails! Snails! Snails! Snails! Snails! Snails! Snails! Lots of snails, but why do I only smell flowers? Wanna pick up a few...? Give me a break, boy! Who do you think you are? It's the slow season. We don't have many shows booked ahead. Does it mean you'll let me do my own show? No. A producer wants to cast you for a movie. It’s quite promising. Why not do a live show? I don’t like acting, you know? Is right now not good enough? Why waste money on a live show? Hello? I can hear you, Dad. I got it. A new challenge from "the boss". It's getting late. What do you have here? Is there food? What is this black thing? All right, come in. You, too! You know what time is it? Wait! Dinh Phong? - Can I take a photo with you? - Ah, yes! My gosh, it hurts so much! Why do I smell shrimp paste...? Hi there. I'm Dinh Phong. You're Dinh Phong? Who's Dinh Phong? Coming, coming. Your appetizer. Damn! Dog sausages! A man must try dog sausages once in his life ‎or else, once he kicks the bucket, - there's no way you can have it! - There's no way you can have it! - Sky. - Yes. Why do you keep scratching your head? I’m working on my Vietnamese essay. The topic is writing about my dream. Piece of cake. No, it’s really complicated. I don’t know how to make it... unique and interesting. Staying true to yourself is more than interesting. The most unique dream is your truest dream! Me, for example. I hope one day I can open a small restaurant. You want to show off your superior crab hot pot, right? You’re indeed my son. But that won’t do, Mom. - Why? - After all, ‎you’re the mother of a superstar. Mother of Dinh Phong! "Clearly not usual." How can I save my face if you run such an ordinary place? No way, Mom! At this point in my life, I’m the happiest man alive because I'm married to the woman I love. And she gave birth to the most loving child ever. Being here makes no difference. If I’d like dog sausages, I'll have some! Why bother? Right? We have to be happy! Then people around us can be happy, too. Am I right? Even if one day I die, I'll still laugh. Do you guys know how I would laugh? I'd laugh like this. The most unique dream is your truest dream! Dinh Phong! He is not usual. Get it? Huh? Live show. Acting. Live show! Acting! - Live show! - Acting. - Live show. - Acting. Oh. - Live show? - Acting! Oh. Hey! I think acting is not so bad. Live show! I think a "live show" is better. Acting. - Forget it. Just go with acting. - Live show! Come on. Let’s do a live show. Acting! Live show? Acting! Live show. If one day... I no longer live... even then... - you'll always be the apple of my eye. - Wow. His eyes are very sincere. I'll be watching... over you. Cut! What on earth is happening? Do you know that my outfit is one of a kind in Vietnam? For the first time auditioning, you did a great job. Outstanding! Especially your eyes. They’re full of emotions. Very fascinating! - You’re done? - Oh. You're kidding me? You can’t rush me on this. It takes way too long! By the way, I only auditioned because the director is my childhood idol. Is that so? I thought you're afraid that Tuan Kiet would get the role. Darn, I haven't washed my hands yet. What? Kiet's also auditioning? Tuan Kiet. Tuan Kiet. "Not a usual rival." Phong? What’s wrong? - Ha. Come here. - Yes! Give me a sec! Phong, what’s wrong? - Damn! Let me flush the toilet first. - Phong! - Are you OK, buddy? - Phong! According to my expert eyes... your eyes... need an injection! - He said injection. - Huh? Injection? But... where? Where does it hurt? My eyes, of course. Yes, your eyes hurt. Should I inject your butt then? Jeez. No, no! Don’t do it! No! No! I can't believe he did it to you! Right! You just reminded me of something. He's an eye doctor, but he has crossed eyes! I mean how? How? Lam, do you understand my pain? It’s... It’s killing me! Hey, it's your eyes. So much pain! For that reason... Live. ...we must do a live show! - Yeah! - Live show! It’s the only way I can heal my pain, bro. "My dear Dinh Phong. I've spent all the time in the world considering, ‎again and again, these words, and today, - summoning up my courage," - Too sexy! "I decided to open up my window, take out my pen and paper, and say out loud, 'Yes! I must write a letter to my dear Dinh Phong!'" "Xuan Dieu, the poet, insisted that love is something undefinable. It’s because he has yet to witness the love I have for you. It’s something you can touch, hold, and grab with ease, let alone define it, my dear. Do you want to touch this love - of mine?" - Let me finish it! "P.S. number one. If you remain silent and neglect me, I will still be loyal and devote myself to you until you agree to see me. - P.S. number two." - Bang! Bang! "I love you! PS number three. Much much more than PS number two! - P.S. number four." - Bang! Bang! Bang! "A thousand times more than PS number three. Signed: Quang Huy." Oh yeah? Really? Quang Huy or Quynh Huong? - Quang Huy, unfortunately! - Something’s not right here. Check over there! Everybody calm down. Calm down. Here. Quang Huy. Baby! - I really can't get it. - Huh? Why do guys easily become gay after joining showbiz? You talk as if being gay is a disease. Think differently. Many gay people are talented and have good taste in the field of arts. What if one day you realize that you’re gay? Then... I'll break up with you. And find myself a husband! Oppa, you're weirdo, really! Are you ok, Oppa? I don't think I hit your face. Hey. And I will find myself a husband! I hate you, really! According to my expert eyes, if it's not simply because I misdiagnosed last time, then maybe it's a neurological disorder. A neurological disorder? I’m not crazy. Not crazy! I’m not saying that you’re crazy. What I mean is, I think you should look for a neurologist. You may have a tumor... in here. - A tumor? - A tumor? Correct! There’s a tumor! It's right here. Here. What? You don’t believe me? Oh, dang! Why? What's the point in pursuing this career for two decades... when nobody trusts what I say? Look! It's right here. This tumor is called a pituitary gland tumor. But don’t worry, it’s non-cancerous. It doesn’t cause any harm. And what-what-what-what we should do now is approach the tumor. Approach it right here, talk to it. I mean the brain, inside your head. "I won't let you stay here for free!" Then grab its neck and throw it out! Do you understand? Goddamn it! I should have become a plastic surgeon! All of a sudden there's a tumor in my brain? "Certainly not usual!" You just need an operation. No big deal. You know, in Korean dramas, people like me always end up dying young! The question is, in this drama, when will it be my last episode? Sorry to my haters, but the chapters of my life are still way ahead! You're crazy. Not u-u-u-usual, yeah! - I’m not your u-u-usual guy - Come on. Please. I got it. You are all special! Don’t be too playful. We're in the hospital. - Good, now you're quiet. - You! Here, my gift to you. It's from your grandmother. Keep it. She's watching over you from above. Then I’ll be unusually strong. - You guys keep it down, OK? - Yes. Why are you dressing like you're on vacation, Phong? She's right. Baby, the operation is early tomorrow. Shouldn’t you be resting today? He's Dinh Phong. - "Not your usual guy." - "Not your usual guy." Ha, Bang, stay in the room. Don’t let anybody know Phong’s out. The nurse will show up at ten for sedation. Sky. Keep his mom busy until it's past ten. As far as I know, Phong only likes to eat my food. You really don't need to do this! Your performance is delayed. Why does this taste so weird? I’m not your usual guy! Hurry up! Quick! Quick! I’m always late on Quang Chi’s show. Let’s drop it. I’m done. No... it's not. This is not OK. I have to "Crouch the Tiger and Hide the Dragon". A patient’s smile... is our happiness. Your laugh is my tears. I’d like to visit patient Dinh Phong. - Stay still! - What's wrong? - Huh? What is it? - Oh my god, my stomach hurts so much. - My stomach hurts! - You have a stomachache? Let's go to the toilet. I’m so sorry, Ha. I tried my best, but that didn't work out. What’s the hurry? Quickly! Come on! What’s got into you today? PREVENTING AND TREATING MALE ILLNESSES You’re absolutely stunning today. A total fashionista! It’s so hot today, Lam. So hot! Unusually hot! Bang. What kind of shot did she give me? - Bang. - Ha. - Bang? - Ha. Bang? Why don’t you call those hot girls’ names? Call Sky! - Why do you keep calling me? - Bang. It’s not like we’re desperate for money. Especially now, what he needs the most is to be healthy. You work and hang out with him, shouldn’t you know what is good for him? Yes, ma’am. - We’re aware of what’s good for us. - "Us"? Isn't now the time to prioritize his well-being? He's having an operation! - How is he, Doctor? - Is he OK? It was a success. - Thank you so much, Doctor. - Thank you. - Meet him in the post-operative room. - Thank you. Listen! We need to inform the hospital if you experience confusion, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, talking in your sleep, unconsciousness. Remember? And what to strictly avoid: no coffee shop dilly-dallying, no performing, no eating out. Home-cooked meals only. Can I go out to improve my immune system? Nope. Singing to improve my skill? No! Bubble tea, Mom? No! Don’t worry, Auntie! I’ll sleep here to check on him. I’ll shout if I see him talking in his sleep! Yeah. - I’m not your usual guy! - Not u-u-u-usual. Why are you so silly, huh? Bang. It's Ha. It's me, Ha. Bang. Bang. Ha is here. Bang! Bang! It's me, Ha! Bang! Bang! Bang. Bang! Bang! Ha! Is someone's dead this early in the morning? And he said he'd stay to keep me from talking in my sleep. Jeez, this guy! Not so bad, eh? I told you to buy colorful lights! But Phong likes white and blue. These two are messing around again. Not this time! Not when I’m composing! Hey! Who are you writing to? - You. - Who is this "you"? - Wait! This is a good spot! - For what? We can set up a mini stage to satisfy his craving to perform. How "spacious" is this place! It’s not even as big as my studio, let alone making a mini stage. - You talk as if your studio is that big. - Don’t question me! My God! "Why do we look so good together? The love you’ve given me is majestic!" Are Koreans that cheesy? - You don’t have to like it. - Jeez! What? Wait! Hold on! Look at you! Take it easy! I'm just kidding! - Don’t say it's cheesy. - Cheesy as a freak! What do you mean? - Do you want bubble tea? - OK! Get down! Don’t even dream about it, foxy! My little foxy. All right. Thank you. Ah, I know which one is mine. Bye-bye! Hello! Hello, everyone! Today we're here for a female superstar whose voice we all heard, but her face has always been a mystery! She has a burning desire to be on stage, even though that has never happened! But today, she is here with us! From top to toe! Such a corny MC! And you're a rude audience! Ladies and gentlemen, due to her latest incident with me, the diva has decided to leave showbiz for good and give way to a famous stinker! Oops! I mean, "Give way to a singer!" He's just got a special role in a multi-episode animated series. I mean in a movie with only one episode! Dinh Phong! Ladies and gentlemen, in order to show my gratitude to my dedicated fans, my manager has decided to let me do a magnificent live show: Dinh Phong and Friends! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Movie is movie. Music is music. "Movie is movie. Music is music." There will be a live show... if Dinh Phong has a hit song that makes it to the top of the charts! Bring it on. I’m not your usual guy Not usual, not usual I’m not your usual guy Coming fourth this week is "Hope You Find Your Way Back Home", by Dinh Phong. I only came fourth! I honestly wish to spend money creating a show for him. However, it seems it's not easy. I’m sorry, you guys. Come on, bro! Who listens to the radio nowadays? - It’s way past this century. Agree? - Yup! People watch everything on the internet and television now. That’s where it counts! Ha! You mean that I’m outdated, too? Of course, how can I possibly be a host and appear on TV from top to toe like you? Of course not. That's not what I mean. Please. How about I give you a foot massage? Whenever I'm with Bang, I feel extr-r-remely... secure. A man like you going with a woman: "I feel extremely secure." Jeez. Man up. Say something else. Are you planning to win her heart with, "Sissy, your little brother loves you so much?" I’m utterly miserable. Keep teasing me, and I might jump off a bridge. Don’t stress! I will never abandon you. Let’s see. Since she's angry with you right now, let's take this chance to turn defeat into triumph. You must do something... tender. Something romantic. And unexpected! Unexpected, isn’t it? That’s it. That’s what I mean! Something like that. I must say that your love for Bang is really strong. The song you made for her is really cute and touching. Thanks to your song, Phong reached the top of the charts after only two days! Please! I know that I'm talented! Anyway, what did you just say? I’m way too cool and handsome and stylish and very gifted as well for an old lady like her which no man wants to pursue! And her voice is the only thing apparent to people. What I just said is only one bit of mine. If I try my best, I'll undoubtedly be famous worldwide! The reason I made this clip is to create a scandal for Phong. I don’t... Bang? You missed! Wait! Bang! Bang! I really want to apologize to you, Bang. I never meant to say those things. I-I-I like you very much. You’re always on my mind. Do you know why? Because I idolize you like... my mama. From now on... Sister! Little brother! Are we clear? - S-I-S Bang... - He's screwed. - Eat more food, OK? - Yes. - You’re too skinny. - Mm. - Bang! - Call me "sister"! Do you think that... Bang and Ha make a great couple? Well... At first, I didn’t think so, but then I could see that they really care for each other. - Care? - Yeah. But Bang was very fierce. Women are fierce, aren't they? She may be older, but she's still a woman. You seem to know a lot about women. Why can't I? If I'm not like that, how can I make you fall in love with me? - Darling, I want to make a baby with you. - Mmm? Now? Here? We can't do that! How can you have such an idea? No way! Oh, no, that's not it. You're such a pervert! - What? - What I mean is that... I want you to be the child of my father! No, not like that. What I want to say is... I want you to be the father of my child someday. - Father of your child? - Yeah. But there’s no way. - Why not? - I just can't. - Why? - I told you I just can't. - Why? Why? - Hey, hey! Drop that idea. How come you...? Look at that! Can you see it? It’s the aliens. They can see what we’re doing. - Help me! - I've always thought... Sky... would be the woman I see every morning waking up. She would be... the mother of my children. "Hope You Find Your Way Back Home", by singer Dinh Phong, has achieved a breakthrough, going from fourth place to the top this weekend. MEET ME AT MY PLACE, LAM! Coming up next is "Music by Request". Jeez, those kids. They think doing a show is easy. Too bad for you, Boss. You're one year older now. C’est la vie. Ta-da, happy birthday and hope you become rich. My hair is ruined. I will always love you because you’re always older than me. Lam, new year, new hair color! You've had the same one for ten years! It's as old as you! Happy birthday, bro! Lam. Today, each of us is going to give you an incredibly special present! - Particularly special. - Totally exclusive. - Totally exclusive. - Yeah. Sounds really nice. - Should I be worried? - Of course not! Phong got you the most advanced laptop! Thank you, Phong. - And baby Bang... - Sis. And S-I-S Bang, she got you the latest smartphone! - Yeah! - There you go! Thank you, Bang. But that is nothing. These two people only gave you one present each. Me? I alone will give you two presents! - Oh, damn. - Am I cool? Am I? - Too cool to be true. - Damn! One laptop case! See? And one smartphone case. Do they look durable? I stayed up all night thinking about it. Thank you. I'm sure they'll last forever. But there is one huge present that we all gave you before this birthday. You forgot, didn't you? Our bet, remember? I'm talking about Dinh Phong's latest song. It is now... number one on the radio charts! - Yeah! - Yeah! I knew it. You took advantage of my birthday. But hear me out. It costs a great deal to do a live show. Especially during these tough times. Anyway, I’ve made my promise. Dinh Phong live show! - Not your usual guy! Not u-u-usual! - Not your usual guy! Not u-u-usual! Yes, Doctor? OK. I see. - Ask him for an autograph. - No. You do it! - No. I won’t! You do it, please. - No, I can't. You do it. - Ask him for an autograph, now! - Oh my God! He’s so cute! - Ask him for an autograph, please. - He’s so cute! A rare disease. One case out of a million people. The maximum time left... is five years. What? You still don't believe me? Why is it always like this? Every time I give bad news, nobody believes me! I’m very sorry. I’m sorry because the last operation wasn’t as successful as I expected. However, we’ll find a way to extend his life. OK? There are two ways. The first one involves creating a hole in his skull. The estimated time for treatment and recovery is three months long. But it is effective. Another option. We shoot the Gamma Knife radiation into his tumor! Suppressing it, yes! With this option, I just need to shoot the beams into his head. It only takes one day. He can leave right after that. And this method is extremely effective against pituitary gland tumors. But with this case, it's not as sufficient... as it normally is. Hi, Dinh Phong. May I have your autograph? Me, too. Can we take a selfie? - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thanks. Strange, isn’t it? Dusk... and dawn. I think both of them are pretty. But why... do people prefer sunrise... and name their children after it? The doctor said the tumor might... affect your vision first. Now we must find a solution to keep your eyes. Keeping my eyes only? What you need to do now is... I’m only joking. Don't worry! Binh Duong show on the 7th of June? SCHEDULE OK. We've just raised his price. Please pay accordingly. Is it true that Gamma Knife... only takes a day? SCHEDULE Hey, Lam, Lam? Why does Phong need to be hospitalized? It’s nothing. I will never forget the feeling... when that metal frame attached to my skull and each screw drilled into my head. It was extremely painful. But... I can’t let my mom and my loved ones see that. It would hurt them more than me. Then, the muscles of my face went numb because of the sedatives injected straight into my head. Phong said he was OK. CRAZY HA AND HIS WACKY COCONUT HEAD! Then what about the radiation thing? Hello, I haven't received your deposit for the show in Binh Duong. Please transfer the money tomorrow. Thanks a lot. Lam, why are you taking new shows so soon? I thought he'd need months to recover? Why don’t you...? I won't drop any of his shows. Do you get that? - Huh? Where are you guys going? - Hi, Auntie! Hello! - Yes, Auntie? - Are you guys traveling with Phong? No, Auntie. We’re asking you to let us stay here for a few days. Are you kidding me or what? Very serious, ma’am! We’re here to watch over Phong, in case there is any labor exploitation happening to him! Our income this month is pretty good. I'll give you your money from last month soon. You know me, I don’t care about money. Just keep it. OK. To celebrate our first night together... - let’s play cards! - Yeah. - But I don’t know how to play. - How disappointing. If Sky doesn’t know how to play, join Phong. - We're gonna play Chinese Poker! - Yes! Chinese Poker? You two count as one. Two, three, four. We have four players. - Let's play. - Agreed. Please sit next to me. One, two, three, four, five, seven, nine, 14... Hey! I have a better idea. Why don’t we play Chinese Poker 17 cards? How can you play Chinese Poker with 17 cards, huh? It’s like... Taker, Picker, Hoarder, Looter! You'll know once you try it. Why are you winking, huh? Just play! Ah, I almost forget. There are only 52 cards. If we divide it by 17, we only need three players. Right. Lam? I think you should go count your money. You guys continue. I’ll go to bed. How can you play with 17 cards, Ha? No idea. I’ve arranged them into five layers already. Too many cards to play. Wait, Lam! Lam! Let me use the toilet first! Lam, Lam! Please wait a bit. Sorry, I can’t hold it anymore. Besides, you’re senior here. Shouldn’t you let me use it first? You greedy man! Is it enough? A bit more, maybe. Lam, it's your turn now. Can’t even take a leak in peace. Shit. Hello? Stomachache! Stomachache! Is that so? Let me check the mail. OK. Wait! Bang! Bang! It's urgent! Don't mess with me, please! Bang! Bang! Hold on! Bang? - Bang. - Ngo Kien Ha! Phong? I will keep your income as usual, OK? OK, man. Am I in a romance movie or a horror movie? Why do my eyes look so fucked up? I’m coming! Give me a sec! Wait! Stop! You! You’re indeed a singer on the set! How can you act with one eye covered? When you perform on stage, you can lip-sync, but with acting, your eyes cannot lie! A true artist is the one who can deliver emotions through his eyes. Make-up! Fix his hair. Director! If an actor needs two eyes to express his emotions, I only need one to convey my feelings to the audience. If so, can I call myself a true artist? Someday, I will no longer live. Even so, my eyes... from above... will always watch over you. Keep watching over your life. Cut! Well done. - Phong! - Yes, Mom? Why is your hair like that? Is it for the movie? No! Uh... Yes. This style is trending now. A fashion trend, Mom. Ah, Mom! This crab hot pot, your signature dish, is superior! - Cleary not usual. - Not u-u-usual. - There you go. Eat up. - Thanks, Auntie. Mm. I swear if you open a hot pot restaurant, celebrities will have to line up to be served! But you said before that my restaurant would make you lose face. And you took it seriously? Come on, Mom. When I was little, I always made fun of my friend Son and his crossed eyes. And now, my eyes are no better than his. How ironic! Amitabha! Jesus Christ! Sky? What? Baby. Do you love me? Sky. What’s got into you? Of course, yes. Yes, yes. Yes! I. Love. You. Then... are you hiding something from me? No, no. No. No, no. No! Get that? Baby. I really want to have a baby with you. Why is it so quiet? Let’s put some music on. - Bang? - Mm? Let’s take a selfie. What's that for? I'll show it to my kids. - What kids? - Our future kids. Our future kids, huh? - Ha! - What? Can you get me some water... from the fridge over there? Jeez. Yes, sir! A friend in need is a friend indeed! - Sis! - Yes, dear? Can you pass me the book "Life of Pi" - on that shelf? - I’m occupied, baby. Please, my pretty sister! I’m doing my nails, you know? Here. Water. On the table, please. Why can’t I find the book? Look, it’s on the second row from the bottom. It's the second book from the right side. You have eagle eyes or what? Your eyes are getting shabby, sis. I can see the book from here. If so, why don’t you get it yourself? Are your limbs cut off or something? Now, I’ve finally realized how much you think of me. Hey, my nails aren't dry yet. Next time, if you see it, go grab it yourself. Stop acting spoiled. Yes, I know. I deeply appreciate your help. Bang, Bang. Let’s take another selfie. - Again? - This time is for our grandkids. Are you messing with me? Knucklehead. - Ha! - What? Can you get me the speaker next to the TV? - What speaker? - The Bluetooth speaker! It’s right next to the TV. Are you blind? This one? Yes, it is. The red one. Exactly! Come on, man. You're so slow! - Phong, do you remember this clip? - Huh? How can I possibly forget? This clip marks the first time you and I appeared on TV! That day, you got blown off from a crane by a gust of wind. Just like that, you fell into a river, and you kept drifting, drifting away. Well, here’s your speaker. If you love me, do me one more favor. Play "Warm Sunshine Slowly Drifting Away". Do you think I’m blind? Baby, do I look good in this? My Sky is in the house! My Sky has a nice body and a pretty face. She looks good in everything. Phong! Phong, are you OK? Phong? Let go of me! I can walk! Did you hurt your head? Why did his eyes become like that? I told him, but he didn’t listen. He keeps working despite his poor health! What else are you hiding from us? I laughed at myself. How silly I am to think that I can keep secrets from the people who truly care for me? Bang, Bang, Bang! Is that... Ma-ma-ma...? Marina Bay. You can’t even see where we are! Trying to fool me, huh? You don't believe me? I can read even the smallest words. OK. Try that one for me! - Ready? - Yeah! Casino. That is spot on! He... he can see, guys! It now truly feels like a tour! A tour! A tour! A tour! I eventually took a trip to Singapore for treatment. My mom didn’t come with me, but all of my people were there. We felt like it was a vacation trip, not one for treatment. I couldn't imagine what was lying ahead, but I didn't mind. It was no longer my priority at that moment. I gradually got used to loss and pain. All I wanted was to enjoy the most joyful moments with my brothers and sisters. It was pointless to overthink, anyway. Wow. This hotel must be super expensive! Because we're downtown! Singapore! Singapore! Singapore! Staying in a place like this only makes your sickness worse! He is a superstar, nonetheless. You make so much money, but you spend it like a cheapskate! How greedy! Oh, man! "A bankrupt actor doing a show to ask for donations." He's made two billion! Incredible! - Really? - Really! What did you say? Doing a live show to beg for money? I swear... even if I have to die, I will not do that kind of thing. It's meaningless. Hey, Bang. Bang. It's Ha. - Ha and Bang. - Leave me be. I’m sleeping! - Stop calling my name! - Bang. Call someone else! Bang, Ha. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang? Bang. Bang? Please, don’t hit me, Bang. This guy. Bang. It’s a beautiful hospital, but everything's in English. What if I mishear something? I'd die for taking the wrong medications! ENGLISH - VIETNAMESE DICTIONARY Should we go back and discuss this with his mother first? Two years. Why did he lose two years, Lam? Why did the doctor say that? And what about that Gam-Gam beam? You keep silent, but you knew it all, right? Why did none of us know anything? What did you just say? Lam, what is really going on? Why did you make the decision so abruptly? Phong may never wake up again! What are you talking about? Lam? Why would Phong never wake up again? Why won’t he wake up? Lam! You promised to not hide anything from us! Why are you so quiet now? What is happening to our best friend? - Why don't you let him go to America? - Say it! It’s 300,000 dollars. Did you hear what the doctor said? It’s 300,000 dollars! That’s almost six billion! So that's the reason? But it's his life! The life of our younger brother! Have you ever given him a single dime for all of the years he's worked for you? What? What? What do you want to do? Bang. Ha. We Vietnamese are always noisy, no matter where we are. How long have you been here? A month already. Someone from your family is having a treatment here? Nope, it's me. My dad said... I got a pimple on my brain. That pimple made my eyes all blurry. And then the doctor said... if they could close one eye, the other one will be bright again. You’re quite cool. I’ve been cool all along. Bro, do you know that... whenever people eat mangoes, they get pimples on their faces? I am, however... classier. I got a pimple on my brain. What's that flower? It’s a dandelion. I don't like flowers at all, but when I look at this flower, I feel really nice. Tuan Anh became my companion in the journey of eliminating the pimple on my brain. Following Lam’s decision, Bang, Ha, and Sky... went back to Vietnam to cut expenses. As for me... I stayed there... to have a fight between life and death. If I won, I'd lose one eye. If I failed, I'd lose my life. Having one eye is not a flaw, as his own style can speak for him. Quick. Quick. Quick, quick, quick! What are you two up to? Mom, today is a wonderful day! I’ve achieved my childhood dream. To get married to a beautiful wife. She's Ugly Betty of Korea! There she is. Say hi to my mom. Hello, mother! You two are full of tricks. Phong. Mom! Today is my happy day! Stand up and greet your mother-in-law! Goodbye! All right! Let’s go! My dear little brother! Bang! This is not Ha’s room! Why...? But we’re like brother and sister. Did you hear the news? You've been nominated as the Most Outstanding New Singer. ‎Did you know that? New Singer? The Most Outstanding? Are you hurt? What do you think? So... it’s not a dream! - Yeah! - Yeah! Oppa, what on earth are you doing? Oh my God! Phong! Are you still my friend? - Yeah. - Yeah. Phong? Try a bit more. Hold your breath, your voice is quite shaky today. No need for further practice. I’ve decided. Today, you’ll lip-sync. Lam, why would we do that? It’s the Awards Night! This is my expertise. Can you stop butting in? New singers make the future of V-pop. And the Most Outstanding New Singer Award goes to Dinh Phong! - He lip-synced! - Look at him! - He lip-synced! How come? - Oh my God! - What the hell? - I can’t believe it! - Get out! - Get off the stage! SINGER DINH PHONG LIP-SYNCED DINH PHONG’S LIP-SYNC BUSTED DINH PHONG: SINGER OR COMEDIAN? DINH PHONG: HIS MIC IS JUST FOR SHOW SOMEBODY KILL HIM! OF COURSE HE DID THAT, HE HAS NO TALENT! HIS FACE LOOKS SO STUPID... TUAN KIET NUMBER ONE! BRO, I DON’T WANT TO SING ANYMORE. YOU'RE VERY "KOOL". DON'T BE BLUE, OK? Is it true what the doctor said? Since his father passed away... Phong's been taking care of this family. But now... with this thing going on, how can I manage to find six billion to let him go to America? Why don’t we do a live show? Through that live show, we can ask other artists to support Phong. It’s true, Auntie. Baby Bang... I mean... sis Bang is right. Phong is well respected by other fellows. I think if we do it, everybody will be willing to help out. All my life, the only thing I can do for him and his dad is cook. Therefore... I count on you this time. Do what you think is best for him. As long as... my son can live. I don’t agree with you. We absolutely have no means to make a show! Besides... who would believe that a star like him has no money for treatment? Then... where's the money he's earned all these years? Is it enough to help out a bit? I have a very pretty friend. Boys would fall for her in an instance, but she always gets dumped after just a few months. One day, during tug of war, I realized she has an underarm odor! My God! It's really bad, you know? Do you think she got dumped because of her underarm odor? Huh? Wait, wait. What’s wrong with you? Are you crying? Don’t tell me your underarm is stinky, too. My dear listeners. That feeling when you have to witness your loved one suffering a fatal illness, without being able to help, is a horribly haunting emotion. My dear little brother, the talented and admirable Dinh Phong, has recently been diagnosed with a deadly brain tumor. LAM CALLING Only one out of a million people have this disease. Since it’s such a rare case, medical science has yet found a way to cure it. At the moment, we can only... do a live show for Phong in order to... ask for your support, so Phong can go to America... and receive special treatment... POOR DINH PHONG... ...and extend his life. Hello? Hello? Hello? What the hell? Why is there a technical problem now? I haven't been able to cry like that for a long time. What do you mean? Oh my God! My effort to put up a show for Phong. Uh... Hello? Hello? Oh, damn it! Unbelievable! Move away! Get away! Get lost! What the hell are you doing? Huh? What are you doing? Stop taking photos! Where's your humanity? Get out! I'm so pissed off! How trashy! Oh my God! No other fan in this world can dream of a day like this... ‎sitting next to his idol ‎in such a romantic place! My dear. You’re doing a live show soon? Oh. I don't think so. Huh? The thing is... Please! Why do you have to pay attention to those tabloids? Curse them! Nothing but a bunch of dirty keyboard warriors! They’re so aggressive online! If they act like that in front of me, I’ll smack them really good! Don't even ask me why! Well, I think that artists like you guys simply need to have a delicious breakfast every morning. And stay away from tabloids, OK? You talk like you know a lot about these kinds of things. "Clearly not usual." Of course, I do. Gay people like us are constantly mentally abused. Even so, I've learned to live a happy life. Have you ever... discriminated against gay people? Since I was a little boy, I've dreamed of having my own child someday. And I’ve always wanted to be a great dad. Like my father. Let him live... and do whatever he wants in life. No matter what he'd like to study, what he'd like to become, he will have my full support. Even if... he’s gay... I'll always be by his side... to protect him. And I'll tell him, "My child. Be a happy person." You’ll definitely be a great father. Dinh Phong. I wish you would become my father-in-law. After a while, the gang took me to the sea to find solace. The sea is where I want to belong. It strangely intertwines with my emotions. Sometimes it’s calm and serene. Sometimes... it feels like the fear I cannot control. Sky! The sea ties with my emotions in an extraordinary way. People say... whenever you feel sad, face the sea and scream out loud! I used to do that. But I didn’t feel any better. Facing the sea... I realize one thing. The fear of loneliness is worse than any other fear in this world. I’ve weathered many storms. But this one is different. In front of the ocean... and the loneliness it embodies, I’m afraid the vulnerability in me will show up, and I'll surrender my fate. TUAN ANH HAS PASSED AWAY THIS MORNING IN THE STATES Throughout this journey, I've come up with a truth. Once you face adversity... you'll go through three stages. Fighting. Accepting. Then letting go. What do you want? I’ve put up a lot with you two. Bang and her cheap PR aren't enough for me to deal with? Don’t mess with my work. There will be no live show! Why keep messing things around, huh? Are you throwing punches at me? You don't deserve to have a voice! Bang did the wrong thing because she wanted to save our brother. But you? What the hell have you done? You kept his illness hidden from everybody. You were afraid that if we or his mother knew the truth, we'd not let him work his ass off for you, right? He could have lived a few more years, but you didn't want to give up your money. You forced the kid to suffer from some freaking Gamma beam! And when we found out, he was almost blind! Why, Lam? He's worked his ass off for years, but who keeps the money? You keep all the money! What's in it for him? When he wanted a live show, you said we didn’t have enough money. When we needed a show to save him, you said there's no money left. How? Did you eat it all? Who gave you the right to act on behalf of his mother, of us, to decide on dissecting his optic nerves? Even the doctor said he wouldn’t do the same thing to his own son! What if he wouldn't wake up again? Bang! Phong! Phong! - Phong! - Phong? - Dinh Phong! Phong! - Phong? - Phong? - Phong! - Phong? - Phong! - Phong? - Phong! Phong! Phong! Dinh Phong! Phong! Darling! Phong! I’m not your usual guy! Not your usual guy! Not u-u-u-usual! Is this voice good enough to do a show without being criticized? THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME AND MY FAMILY I'M DOING WELL THANKS TO YOUR LOVE DINH PHONG SHOWS GRATITUDE TO HIS FANS ON FACEBOOK SHOCKING REVELATION OF DINH PHONG’S ILLNESS HEARTBREAKING STORY ABOUT DINH PHONG'S ILLNESS V-POP STARS SHOW SUPPORT TO DINH PHONG How do you want me to live? - I want you to always smile. - OK! You’re strong and amazing. Come on, let’s take a photo. Thank you, man. Have you lost your mind? Pretentious! Get well soon and sing again. And right after this, let’s welcome a not-so-ordinary singer! But definitely not "under-ordinary" by any means! Please welcome the man of the night, your "not usual singer"! Where? Dinh Phong! Hello, hello, hello! Hello to all my beloved fans out there! Today is indeed a very special day for me. Do you think I still look good? Having one eye is not a flaw because my own style is speaking for me! Bang and Ha always tried to convince my mom... to make this live show for me, so I can have six billion Dongs! "Clearly not usual!" That will give me more time to live. But from the bottom of my heart, I... do not wish to stand on this stage today! I don't want it. Because... this is not the live show I always envisioned. Everybody has his youth. I am no different! But... perhaps... my youth... is forever the unfinished one. At any moment, I may stop walking this path and rest in peace. Therefore, I agreed to do this live show to send a word of gratitude... Not really. Not one, but thousands of words of gratitude... to my beloved audience! And... to receive... all the affection of my fellow artists. I once saw... the bewildered look on my mom's face. After that, she pretended like nothing happened. That look on her face... it's haunting... and it hurt me profoundly. I wish, on behalf of my father, to always take care of my mom. And... I also wish to hold a wedding... for Bang, Ha. No, not "bang ha". It should be Ha-Bang. Who'd call it Bang-Ha, right? Ha! So sorry, man! Sky? I want to be... the father of your child. There were nights... where I woke up suddenly... and realized... the tumor in my brain... is stealing my days away... from the little time I have left. I want to scream out loud... "Please give me a little more! Just a little more time! So I can see... my mom, Bang, Ha... Sky... living a good life." I saw... Bang and Ha fight against Lam. I’m truly sad... truly devastated... to see them against each other because of me. But it’s true. My manager, Lam, has been hiding all my money. He's the one who kept my illness secret so I could continue to perform. Ha, stop it! Stop! It’s him... who decided... to have my eye cut out. Please... don’t tell anyone about this. I don't want my mom... to worry. I really can't tell... if I’m afraid to die or not. But there’s one thing I’m terribly afraid of. Being separated from my loved ones. But we have to fight this battle! Fight this battle? That means I'll be bedridden for months! I don’t want to see anybody suffering because of me! You'll always have me, Sky, Ha, Bang. The doctor said that we must always be hopeful and stay positive. I know. But... you'll never know that feeling... when a normal person... discovers that he'd die soon... would go through this. Promise me one thing? I don’t care how long I'll live... but as long as I’m alive... let me be as good as I can be... as happy as I can be... and be able to see... my loved ones... as long as possible. And... let me sing as much as possible. OK? All of those things... Lam's done it for me. It was my last wish. Dandelion is a very beautiful flower, but its lifespan is short. At the end of its life, its pistil gives birth to many seeds. Each seed sticks to a white and fragile feather. The feathers then carry the seeds away by the wind. That's how the flower can breed and multiply in new horizons... Actually, we promised Phong more than just one thing. We promised to take care of his mom for him and to be her children as well. THE SUPERIOR CRAB HOT POT Our crabs are superior! One kilo for each of you? Got it. Two kilos! But that will be too much! Not that much. - A kilo of crab for each of them. - All right. Coming right up! Phong and Lam also shared another secret. They saved every penny they made to quietly seek treatment everywhere. Later, when Phong no longer wanted a cure, he asked Lam to help him save money so one day his mom could open a small restaurant. The other part of his savings, Phong didn't want to selfishly use it to expand his lifetime, as he thought, at that point, it would be pointless. He asked Lam to help him open a fund to save as many children as possible. And that also reminds us that he's still very close to us. One, two, three! One more, guys! One more! Hey, Phong! Bang and I have a baby! Take a look! Wanna know his name? He’s Chua! Wondering why? "Chua-Bang-Ha". It's our family. Take a close look! Hey, I miss you a lot, buddy. However, don’t pay us a visit, OK? I'll see you again one day when I die. Guess you'll have to wait very long! Mom? Yes? Mom’s here! Is this your wedding or what? Look at you guys! Want to outshine the bride and the groom? Let's go somewhere else, kid. Your mom's colorful dress makes me dizzy. Sky! Once I’m dead, it means that you and I have walked a complete life together. I want you... to have a new happy life... with someone who is very, very, very wonderful! And he'll be the father... of your children. Get that? One, two, three! Mom, Dad. This is... my boyfriend. What did he say? He said I look like Hoang Thuy Linh! He's funny! You two... Who's the wife? Who's the husband? Well... Oops. He can speak Vietnamese! We've been in a relationship for almost three years. Oh. About what you just asked... We're versatile. Phong, I followed your advice and told my parents the truth. I was super nervous! But I would not be able to do it without your encouragement. Thank you so much. I'll buy you drinks once I join you in heaven! Phong was the only person who helped me close the gap between me and the chaotic world out there. He came into my world tenderly, talked, and listened to me, a mute girl living in her own world. I remember the stories behind every bubble tea I made for him. Every single one.
