- Where are you? I'm gonna give you an ass-whipping! - Stop it! No, quiet! - Nice of you to show up. - Oh hey, buddy. - Hey, Mama. - Stan, would you take Will out and let me have a moment? - Honey. - Stan. - You okay? - Yeah, baby. I just wanna talk to your brother. - Be right outside. - Okay, baby. Oh, my buddy. - How you doing, Mom? - Better now. How 'bout you? - Just want to make sure you're okay. - Ah, we're talkin' about you. - I'm fine. - Liar. I could always tell. - Well, I'm always fine. - Yeah. You know you can't help this time. - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. - You have nothing to be sorry about, buddy. Can I ask you something? - Course. - Will you promise me you'll do it? - Well, ya gotta ask first. What is it? - Take your brother back home. - No. - He needs to see where he's come from. - No. No he doesn't. - He needs to meet Bill. - What the shit? - Watch your mouth. - Nah, I'm sorry, but Mom, Bill? - They need to meet. - Why? - Because he's his father. - Stan is his father. - Okay. Then he needs to meet your father. It's my dying wish. - Really? You're using that? - Yeah, I am. I love Stan, but Will needs to see the world in a different light. - Mom, Will won't care or go. - He will, if you tell him that I said to. He could learn something from being with you. - Hell, Mom, you saw, we can barely stand to be in the same room together. - I'm your Mom. And I'm dying. - Don't say that, don't. - It's true. - Do you wanna die? - I would love to see you get married and grow old. And, I'd eventually love to see your brother get his head out of his butt. If it's my time, then I'm ready. - What if I'm not ready? - Oh, buddy. I'm not going anywhere that you can't follow me later. The living has been hard, but the dying, it'll be easy. - I just want the pain to go away. - Here, I want you to have this. I've always worn it. And every time you look at it, I want you to have the peace that I have found. You need to get out and you need to face your past. It'll be good for both of you. - Mom, I told you, I'm fine. - I know you said that, and it's still total bullshit. - You watch your mouth. - Life has always been a battle for our family especially back home. You need to go back. You need to. If not for yourself, do it for me. And Drew? - Ya? - Don't wait. I love you, buddy. - I love you, Mom. - Get back here, you bitch. - No! No! Stop it! - Drew where the hell did you put my whiskey at? I need it now, I need it now! Just calm down. Bill, please! - Where are you, huh? Where are you? Where are you? Nowhere. - What? - Hey, it's me. - Who's me? - It's your brother, Drew. - What the hell do you want? - Come on, just buzz me in, will ya? - It's too damn early. - Just do it. - So this is my place. - It's nice. - Damn right it is. When you run your own company you gotta show for it. - Thought it was Stan's company? - Well it'll be mine eventually. - Must've been nice having a job right out of college. - Well, if only you tried. - Did Mom say that? - Mmm, Stan. - Stan, Stan, of course he did. - So what've you been up to these past few-ish years? - Ah, you know, just been searching around for the meaning of life. - How's that working out for ya? - So listen, Mom wants, Mom wanted, you and I to take a trip. - Where? - Home. - I am home. - Our birth place. - Why? - Excuse me. - I think it'd be good for you. - Well, I'm mourning at the moment. - Yeah, I can see that. - So what's in our hometown? - Dad. - Dad's here. - Your real Dad. - Mom never talked about him-- - Yeah, well I'm not surprised. Listen, it was her dying wi... She asked. - So now you give a shit about Mom? - What's that supposed to mean? - You were never around. - Says who? - S-s-s-- - Stan. - So, if I were to go on this trip with you, it'd be just you and me? - Yeah, it is, you and me. - And no one else? - No one else. Which part of that didn't you understand? - Just being clear, dick. - See you tomorrow, 9 am. - Whoa, tomorrow? Mom's funeral is in five days! - Yeah, we'll be back in three. Max! - Do you, um, wanna grab a beer later? - See you tomorrow at 9 am! - Oh, I'm not riding in that. - Get in the car. - Does it even have AC? - Get in the car, princess. - Are we even gonna make it? - It's not like I use those. Where are we? - 'Bout 10 hours out. - Ah, that's it? - - Ya. - All right, I gotta piss. - Now? - When else am I gonna go? To redneck America! - How much longer? - Almost there. I remember this. - Is this it? Are you going to turn off the engine? The hell, man. Are we going or not? - Just stop. - The lights are on. Usually mean's somebody's home. Thought you wanted to get this over with. Drew? Drew? What are you doing, man? - Not now. - This place is a ghost town. It always look like this? - No. No, it didn't. - Why are we here? I would literally stay anywhere else. I'll sleep in the car! - Okay. - Are we their first customers since 1968? - Well, since the mines closed-- - Mines? - Yeah, mines. - Who the hell was mining in this town? - Bill. Grandpa Paul. Come on, let's go. - Where are you going? - Get something to eat. - Well, give me a second here, geez! - Well, hurry up. - Well, I've been in a car for 15 hours, I smell like cr... I'll take my chances. - Hey fellas, listen, we're closing. - Yeah, apologies. Uh, any chance of just getting something quick to go? - Got some pizza left over in the back. How's that? - That'd be perfect, thank you. - What about a burger? - Pizza is fine. - Okay. - What? All right, fine. - This place doesn't even have a yelp review. Oh, excuse me. Hey, gorgeous. My name is Will and you are? You know, to complete this meet and greet, I kinda need to have your name. - And, who says I wanna complete it? - Saucy. Do you come with the pizza? - Okay. - I just got here from Orlando and uh... - Great. And if I ever want to write a biography about your life, I've got enough info. - Well there's more. - Well, I don't wanna know what I know now. - Most girls do. - Well, I'm not most girls. - Well, I'm only here for a couple a days, so if you wanna-- - Let me guess, get drinks and rip my clothes off? - Well if you don't have time for both, we can just skip the drinks. - You've got two hands. Choose one. - I usually use both. - I doubt that. Night, Rick. - Goodnight, Evelyn. - Until next time, Evelyn. If that's an offer then I accept. It's not all bad here. - Here's your pizza. It's 20.75. - Thank you. Keep the change. - All right, thank you. - Appreciate it. - Appreciate it. - This pizza is actually edible. - You're welcome. - Don't you think it was weird? - What's that? - Think she was a lesbian? Think that's why that server didn't hit on me? What was her name? - Evelyn. - Yeah. Evelyn. She's gorgeous. - And smart. - How do you know? - She turned you down. - Drew! Where are you at? - Stop it, Bill! - Drew! Where's my whiskey? - No, no. - This is Sheldon on WPHB Radio. Got the weather forecast for you today. Now the weather forecast for you folks in Clearfield. Beautiful day in August, ah, temperatures will be in the 80s today, before dropping down tonight into the 60's. Hey folks, good day to go to the Clearfield fair! And don't forget, come on over to the Clearfield Drive-In on Route 322. - Rachel. - Yeah. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing? - I thought you were in New York. - New York didn't work out. - Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just none of my business. I just, it's a, surprised to see you. - Yeah. I know. Feeling's mutual. - So you workin' here? - Yeah, I'm back. Had to move back a couple years ago, - You look, uh, amazing. - It's my work gear. God, it's crazy, what are you doing here? - Uh, Mom wanted me to show Will his home town, so... - Right. - Family. - Yeah, how is your Mom? How's Sarah? - Yeah, she's good. Uh, I got some stuff I gotta take care of today so... - Yeah, right, right. Yeah, I gotta go. - Yeah. - I gotta go. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It was great to run into you. - Well, get running. - Yeah. - Hey. Stop by and see me before you leave, okay? - Yeah, I will. - This place looks worse when the sun's up. Can't imagine they eat the food here. - Hey guys. - Hey. - What can I get for you? - Well, some new utensils and a wet cloth would be nice. - Two coffees and waters please. - I'll just take a coffee. Can imagine what the water tastes like. - What do you think the coffee's made out of? - Beans. - And? - Shit. - Yep. Thank you. - Thank you. Do you have any, um, alternative milks? - No. - It was worth a shot. Must suck when lactose intolerant people come here. - Are you lactose intolerant? - No, but still. None of this looks good for my diet. - May I take your order? - Yeah, I'll just take the oatmeal with boiling hot water, please. - All right. - I'll have eggs scrambled, bacon, pancakes. Thank you. - So what is there to do here? - Uh, there's a old drive-in movie theater, it's nice, if you like movies. - Really? - Yeah. - Did you go on any dates? - A few. - Really? - Yeah. - Different l-l-l-ladies? - With one, lady. - The loner brother was in love? You still in love? - Just drop it, okay? - No, this is great! - Just drop it, okay? - - No, why would you-- - Enjoy. - Thank you. Hi. - Hi. - Will you go out with me tonight? - I'm sorry? - I mean, I'd like to take you out on a date. - What if I'm seeing someone? - Oh, ah... - I'm not seeing anybody. - So? - Yeah? - I will pick you up at seven. Oh, um, where do I pick you up from? - Remember my Dad's place? - Course. - I'm across the street. - Well, I'll pick you up across the street. - Seven. - Seven. - So what else is there to do in this apocalyptic town? - Will you stop talking like that? - Okay. - This place has changed a lot since I was here. - Is that the school? - Yeah. Yeah, that's it. - So this is the school? - Yeah. - And I would've gone here? - Yeah, we both would've. K-12, 13 years in the same building. - Okay, what is there even to live for here? I mean, I'm even shocked this school looks so nice, I figured all my tax money would be going to welfare and child support. - Get in the car! - What? - In! - Just an observation. - Get outta the car! - No! - Get outta the car! - No! - Get out, get out! Look out there! Look! This is your birthplace. You remember that. And these people, they love this town, they love it, and they work hard to survive in a way that you would never know! This is someone's home and you never disrespect that. Even if it's your own. - This isn't my home. - It was Mom's. This was Mom's home. Ah! - Wow, I miss her. - Yeah, I miss her too. - You look good. - Thanks. - How do I look? - Redneck. - Well, thank ye! - I can give you a lift to the bar, if you like. - Are you gonna be there later? - Well likely, yeah. - You think we can have that brothers' beer? - Yeah, course. - I just never had a beer with you. - Are you sure about the shirt? - I wear it. - Ready? - Ready. ♪ 'Cause I'd rather be out here in the middle of nowhere ♪ ♪ Runnin' down some dark highways ♪ ♪ Playin' bars and county fairs ♪ ♪ Anywhere they got a stage ♪ And, I can strap a guitar on ♪ See the crowd all sing along ♪ Where and I'd do this for free ♪ ♪ There ain't no place I'd rather be ♪ - Hey.

My Mom wanted a fresh start and here I am. She always said, you date someone worthless, you end up worthless yourself. - Well if it isn't Drew's little bitch of a brother. You're in my seat. Your drunken daddy's bar stool's in the corner. - I don't see your name on it. - It's next to my woman. - That's your woman? - Yes. - That can't be. - Why's that? - She's too pretty and smart for you. - Listen, you little son of a bitch. - Nifty! - You'll know I'm talkin' to you because... - You'll be looking at me. - Good girl.

You want a beer? - Yeah, let's get a beer. - All right. - That's the courthouse, got up in there once when I was 14. Got in a fight with my science teacher. This, in here, this place used to be a little coffee house. Mom and Bill had their first date in there. Believe it or not, Bill actually had a soft spot. - Really? - Yeah. Mom used to sneak out of the house, come and meet him here. - Mom? - Mmm hmm. Yeah, I could see that. That woman could charm her way out of anything. - You got that from her. - Yeah, well, you're pretty like her. Hey, can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Why did we leave this place? - Mom just figured there were better opportunities for you in Florida. Get out of this town. - Mom knows best. Hey, what did the, what did the Sheriff mean? - When? - He said bad history repeating. - Yeah, that wasn't the first time that Nifty and I got in a little fight. - No shit. Did Bill beat Mom? I'm asking. - Don't. Don't. - Fine. Let me ask you another question. Why did you leave us? - The family was better off without me, trust me. - Well that's a crock a shit. You disappeared! - I didn't disappear. - The fuck you didn't. I never heard from you. - I called, I called Mom. - Mom? - Yeah! - Did ya forget you had a little brother? You're supposed to protect me, like you did tonight, my whole life! You left me too, Drew! - You know, I wouldn't have been a good role model for you, I wouldn't have been. - What does that even mean? - That means a man should be able to look at himself in the mirror, look himself in the eye and know exactly who he is! And I couldn't do that, I couldn't do it. - Can you now? Drew? - Drew! Right now, let's get back here, now! Drew. Gimme my whiskey! - No, no! - Gimme my whiskey, now! Drew! Drew! - Stop it! - No! - Stop! - You'll pay for this! - Drew, Drew, Drew! Drew, Drew, Drew! Drew, it's me! It's Will! You're okay! - I'm sorry. - You're okay. - I'm sorry. - You're okay. - I'm sorry. - Drew? Drew Caldwell? - Pastor Thomas. - Well, I'll be. How you doin' son? - Yeah, I'm doing well. Yourself? - Yeah. I'm doing good. I heard you were back in town, and I heard you already had a little run in with Sheriff Randall. - Yeah. - Yeah, some things never change, do they. - No they don't, no matter how hard you try. - Something bothering you, son? - I can't figure it out. - Can't figure what out? - Life. - Yeah, well, that is a difficult puzzle. Which piece? - Most of them. You know, coming back here has brought back-- - Painful memories? - Yeah. - So why did you come back? - Bill. - Yeah, that's interesting. - Mom wanted Will and I to come and see him. - You know, your Dad wasn't in church this past Sunday. How's he doing? - Bill goes to church? - Yeah, he's been comin' to church pretty much every Sunday for quite a while now, he helps out around the place. - Bill? Bill Caldwell? - Yeah, your Dad. You know, it's amazing what happens to a man when he loses his family. - How much do you know? - Everything. You know, Drew, when I was a child I had a good friend. And his father was really sick and almost always in severe pain. And the only thing that seemed to kill the pain for him was alcohol. And when he drank too much he did things that he really didn't want to do. - Yeah, like beating his wife and kid? - Yeah, things like that. You know, and as I got older, I heard rumors about your Grandfather Paul, and how he was the town drunk and he was a heavy drinker, obviously. And, whenever he drank too much he used to beat your father. So it never surprised me that Bill turned out the way he did. - I had no idea about Grandpa Paul. - Yeah, it's true. And Drew, you need to break that cycle. But you can't do it on your own. Your father needed God's help, and you do too. - Tell me, how do you forgive Bill, for what he did? - Christ's death and resurrection made it possible for God to forgive us, and we all need forgiveness. You just need to ask. - How am I supposed to forgive him? - Your father, he's a good man. - The hell he was! - He's a fallen man, just like all of us. - No! No, he-- - He surrendered his life to Christ. - I'm just so scared I'm gonna end up like him. - I know you are, but just because you have his blood, that doesn't mean you're gonna be like him. You know, Jesus has saved many a troubled blood line. - I gotta go. - Drew, you know, we all need a savior. And you know what? I'm really thankful that I know Bill. You want that shipped out? Okay. I appreciate the order. Thank you. Hi son. - Mr. Williams. Is Rachel here? - Yeah. Heard you had a date last night. I don't think she really wants to see you. Just a warning. - Thank you. - Rachel! - What do you want? - I just, I came to apologize for last night. - For what? - For the way I behaved. I didn't mean for the night to end. - I don't... Not a letter for 10 years, Drew? A phone call? You left me, Drew. Do you think I came back here looking to date another loser? And that's what you are. - No. - Yeah, You're a loser! - I had to leave. - You walk in here acting like things have changed, like you've changed. Get out, get out! Drew, get out! - Forget it. - Dude, you, are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay, game plan? - Bill. - Okay. - Let's go. - So are you nervous? Yeah, I am too. - Bill? - Hey. Will! - Drew. - Shit. - Oh shit, is he dead? - Help me. Help me! - Was it a heart attack or... - Yeah, likely. - Call 9-1-1? - Sure. - There's no signal. - No! - Drew? - Where are you? Huh? Where are you? Are you even real? Are you even real? Then do something! Do it! You give a shit about anything, you give a shit about any of this? Then help me, help me, please. Just help me. Just help me, please. Please. 'Cause I don't know how to do this. Help me. Please help me. Well, I guess that's that, then. Well, I guess that's your answer. - Thank you. Thank you. - Will, you can take it from here. Just remember what I told ya. - Thanks, Sheriff. How you doing? Mind if I join you? I'll interpret that as a yes. Why are you so upset he's dead? I thought you hated him. - I hated this place, hated myself. This town, what happened here, destroyed my childhood. And I thought it was better for me to be alone. - Well, you're never alone, if you don't want to be. - Just want you to know, I never hated you. Never. I won't leave you again. Hey, what time is Mom's funeral today? - Umm. - If you text Stan we'll find out. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm doin' okay. My dearest Rachel, if you're reading this, then Will and I are probably on the road back to Mom's funeral, and back to Florida. I can't tell you how incredible it was to see you this week, such a surprise. Please let me apologize again for my behavior the other night. But maybe something good has come from it. Because from that moment, I now see that I have to make some changes. I have to take responsibility for the man that I am and the man that I wanna become. For a long time I've been running away from who I am, running away from my past, from my history, from my family, from my faith, from my bloodlines, but no matter how far I ran, all I ever found was darkness. I don't wanna live in the darkness anymore, and I've seen now what the light looks like. I wanna change. But now, through grace, I understand how to do that. I don't expect you to wait for me, and I understand if you don't, but one day I'm gonna come back, just to make sure. You are amazing Rachel. I love you and I always have. Drew. - Oh, shit. - Shit. - I'm not sorry I missed Mom's funeral. I had fun. She knows. We still got a wake to go to. - So this was all for me, huh? You were right. As always. I love you. Here ya go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey! - Well. - Hey! House looks great! - Thank you, been busy. - I can see that. - How was the trip? - Well, Spain was uh, great. - Yeah, where's Evelyn? - Still in Spain. - Aw, no. - Oh. - No. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry. - It's fine. I encouraged her to see the world, so. - Thought you meant seeing it together? - I did, but ah... Next trip's to Australia! So are you guys comin'? - Oh, I think we got our hands full here. - No. Yeah, we've got work to do on the house. - It's still gonna be here when you get back. - I know, but then by that time he'll be changing diapers. - Congrats guys! - Thank you. - Thank you. - Now, you're never gonna be able to come with me anywhere. - One day, we'll just bring the kids. - Don't be such a stranger. - You either. - Told you I've been busy. - Yeah. So I came up here to personally tell you that Stan's opening up an office up here, and he wants you to run it. I'm serious. - Wow. I'd love to. Thank you. - Great. It's gonna be great working with you. All right, well I'm gonna send the paperwork up. I love you. - Love you too. Good to see you. - Good to see you too. - Thanks for stopping in. - Hey Babe? Can you come help me with this? - On my way. - Oh you sweet thing. Huh? - Huh, what's all this racket? Hey come on. There you go.
