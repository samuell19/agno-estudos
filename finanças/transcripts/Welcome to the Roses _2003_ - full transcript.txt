You can say that How come I can find anything If you don't mind I want to go on with preparing the supper Otherwise I wouldn't be able to make it Don't worry, it's the automatic door to the garage Okay, the door is open Hi, Daniel Hi Do you have anything on your mind? Yeah Did you see my dog in your garage? No It's lost again Probably it ran from that end of the fence The fence needs to be fixed We talked about this but we haven't set any date You decide the time You just approve a refit plan I'll see to the rest I have a catalog, how about a little chat? I will be right there Freeze there Let me go Papa I am really sorry The garage door was blocked Excuse me There's something My mother is preparing for the wedding anniversary Oh, you are such a lucky guy It's all right I'll be back later Are there many guests already? No, only two Just breakout prisoners No matter who they are My dear The supper is not ready yet We have something unexpected What is that? Did he shoot you? Where did you hurt? Where? I did this to myself Relax They agreed to not having supper here I think he's even kinder than us They are not ferocious at all Two dangerous prisoners escaped during their transfer Us? They are talking about us The incident happened at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon It's on the interprovincial highway crossing the Flurhay-Prizans Forest According to several witnesses It's estimated that this breakout has neither complicity nor premeditation One of the prisoner, Gilbert for involving in a small lawsuit was sentenced to two years in prison. His term of imprisonment is nearing its end You are so foolish And another one Michel Garmay is an unexcused prisoner His nickname is MG Possibly referring to intelligence To me, MG always refer to edible oil He was the ringleader of the notorious armed robbery 9 years ago They robbed a bank in Saint Bursan that provides loans for growing grapes During the course there are hostages hold And the case ended up with the death of an employee Mr. Garmay was sentenced to 20 years in prison His confession in the courtroom didn't convince the jury because he woundn't plead guilty That's not my fault You tell them That's not my fault! You are an reporter Tell them I was not wrong! Above is the office statement Since I am not the reporter investigating this case I don't know if you would be satisfied with this report Mr. Garmay In fact, you were only an accomplice You were an employee of the robbed bank You only provided the criminals with some information on the security monitoring system in the robbed bank Right, right, that's the truth The reward was three months of salary Mr. Sharl Greynach Are you the lawyer for Mr. Garmay? Yes At that time The real ringleader of that case contacted Mr. Garmay Is that true? Yes, but I didn't ever know who he was Yes As to me We investigated his identity not for any professional secrets The reason is very simple We wanted to understand this person It's him who instigated me to do those things He also promised to save me if I got into trouble Therefore we can't turn our back upon this Someone saw the two escaped criminals in and around the Flurhay-Prizans Forest From now on Every trunk road in this region is under police' control Now I know the whole thing No matter how If you'd like to stay for supper I'll prepare some more dishes Which dishes do you prefer? Got any plans? We are doomed to death Surely you have, right, Mr. MG? Very sorry I am very sorry to bother you in your weeding anniversary This reminds me of the time when my wife and I were together Pull yourself together You haven't lost anything Look At least you need to take away all the telephones excluding the one in the living room We'll give our cellphones to you also Yes, yes I insist to do so No one would know what's gonna happen Try it And cellphones are not as valuable as wedding rings Magali Put the cellphones upstairs with Mr. Gilbert Is you name Gilbert? Bring all of them upstairs? Right Oh, what about those guests? Louis Dovick is returning from school soon Can I make a phone call to him? I will find an excuse and ask him to stay over night at his schoolmates' In the meantime You can cancel the invitations to our friends I'll try But this is so tricky Let me explain this to you I work in a daytime hospital for psychopathic children as a part-time social welfare personnel Do you know hysteria? Hysteria, yes, I know that Great! Those children are very mysterious and arresting The Mearlow's are both supervisor to the hospital and psychiatrist there We are friends, very good friends But it's still hard to explain to him Don't worry He will understand Dr. Mearlow This is the Bermariyan Hospital What can I do for you B?atrice, wait a second Yeah, excuse me I have been studying the case of Alexander Jr. Now he has entered the phase of self-controlled mutilation At one time he broke his head At the other time he thrashed his arms In the last two days he struggled to bump his back against everywhere How about you, B?atrice Are you okay? Damn flies! Ah, yes Your twentieth wedding anniversary Does your daughter suffer from mental stress? Since a long time ago She is good, very good People like to stay together with her Frankly speaking Probably some kind of blasphemy make her go down with such a psychological disease I treated her with psychotherapies But this is too slow She strongly opposed it She felt that she still belonged to Satan Now it worked thanks to Mr. President When Louis Dovick came to attend the chastenment committee yesterday mentioned to us your fondness for poems Can we have our poem club now? Yes Please wait Hello? Papa! I will be right back, don't worry Yeah The meeting was longer than expected But don't be afraid It's your wedding anniversary, I won't Ah? Yes?

Got something to do today I'll leave her alone for now Stop that I don't wanna go at all I am scared I think I will feel uneasy all over If you find them to be old-fashioned it's not too late to leave at that time Magali is a very good friend of mine You understand that, don't you? She wouldn't wanna see me drinking with her uncle all the time You can have a lot of decious food there especially sweets Mrs. Roze makes first-class glair almond cookies You choose me or those cookies Okay, okay I give up to go there But we'd better say hello to her family There are still many things to do Yeah, your are right That's the reason why I ask you to choose Don't be curmudgeonly, I am only staying there for two minutes Yes But when Magali sees me together with you she will ask you what's going on No, I don't want it, you have to hide me Where? I don't know either, anywhere Only two minutes Say yes, dear uncle! We have no way to contact him He is not taking his cellphone He must be on his way He is always early When he arrives you go out find an excuse and ask him to leave You don't know him He's as stubborn as a mule There's absolutely no way to persuade him You know He's always like that Look, here he is Ask him to leave This is good for everybody He won't listen to me, never I think Magali can give it a try He likes you As to me, he knows too much He can tell immediately that I am lying Hello, uncle Ah, Magali, how are you? There's a small incident, sorry Do you want to say something? No, No please You tell your parents that I am sorry Please tell them I can't be their guest today I have to something unexpected to deal with Sometimes it happens There's something wrong with the cultural center I have to be there Is it for your next performance? Yeah Is there an 18-year-old girl? Yeah I will like her Really Get in This is my home! What are you going to do? You are so unsympathetic He just came home This is the point Someone self-invited goes everywhere Is this normal? And he found such a pretext to reject an invitation You can check if he has a cellphone with him Don't kill me Please Don't kill me, I am a patient Anybody? I can't stand any more She will suffocate in the trunk I don't care May I go? She looks quiet It would be a pity if she dies Don't you know that in a time like this there are things more important than the girl? What else do you like? Shotgun? No no, I guarantee to you that it's gardenia My wife loves gardenia a lot Please let me go, please I will give you anything you want I have a heart problem and have to take medicines on schedule I'll tell you the names of those medicines I need anti-heart-failures drugs I need anti-convulsion drugs, anti This fellow needs anti-everything drugs Be patient It'll be better, uncle Think for him He wants to release you also But he can't You know They are having a hard time too Come and try my glair almond cookies It happened so sudden today that I didn't have time to prepare some little cakes Never mind, madam Thank you They look very delicious This is all natural Authentic glair almond cookies are all natural They are only made from almond powder If you don't mind I'll go change upstairs Hold it Help yourself It's my pleasure What do you two want to drink? Here I have champagne But in this kind of situation probably you would prefer I just want to think it over How about your wound? What suprised me is Perhaps it's stupid to think this way But aren't you going to be set free soon? Yeah It can be even more unrestricted than home Why did you still want to escape? Is the prison that unbearable? Right That is the most unbearable place I didn't want to escape This was an accident Magali, your question might get people bored And you've also interrupted Mr. MG's thoughts In this way he won't be able to find a solution Look, we've brought trouble to others There is someone in the garage It's police! God, we are finished! They have found here They are so fast The worst moment is coming We could only fight! We are dying I am telling you! We are dying without even any belongings It's so ridiculous Madam, it's me We totally forgot there is she It's Marsanne, Marsanne I'll talk to her Are you sure? Yeah, she came just to help me prepare the supper She always comes in through the garage Don't worry I know how to send her away Gugu, Marsanne! I have to come in here The door is blocked Look at my clothes It became so dirty Damn! You can wash it clean with ease Washing the clothes is even more expensive than buying a new one! You always exaggerate, Marsanne It's gonna be fine There's something wrong with the door, I admit I am feeling better I will tidy it up and you don't have to work here tonight As compensation I will make this clear to the guests I will tell them You mean I came here and had nothing to do? That's true But I will pay you as I promised Did I ride one hour of bus for nothing? I'll say it again I will compensate you for all your time and dry clean your clothes plus the fare for the public traffic Yes, yes I left my daughter with 49 degrees fever for here You are exaggerating again Such a young child would have already died of 49 degrees Yeah, she is dying but I came here for nothing? Frankly speaking, Marsanne Okay, I am willing to pay the medical treatment as goodwill Please don't demand for more Pay, pay I am fed up with that Do you think this is the panacea for everything? Do you think by paying me you will live in peace? Narcissism Do you know what narcissism is? You are so darkminded! Marsanne Don't bring me any more trouble! Do you think I have no trouble at all? I came to prepare the supper and I will do that No Let's see Marsanne We have enough maids already Mrs. Roze It's you who likes to exaggerate You are fired! Great But after the supper Get out of my home! Get out! Shut up! Stupid woman! Stupid woman! I will throw this immediately! Stupid woman! Stupid woman! I think we can't bring her through No matter how it's me who wanted to get rid of her She never knows where he is I told her one hundred times to put the vacuum under the bed One hundred times! Do you have a plan? What are we going to do? Magali, please go back to your room In fact this is not a big deal If you hadn't come here it wouldn't have happened I think you killed a number of people including the two policemen died recently It shouldn't be a problem if adding one more I didn't do nothing I never killed anyone If you set me free I'd like to testify for you How I admire your family value! Jean-Louis I am telling the truth Daniel Daniel is right If you do not hesitate to betray your family it's hard to ensure you don't spread the word I can't take this risk I just wanted to live the 6 months quietly I don't know what you are going to do, MG But I am going I'd rahter go elsewhere to find opportunities Very sorry to disturb you Thank you for your cookies, madam Too hotheaded, Gilbert And it's too late to go now Think about it Look at Mr. MG He knows how to think and he's a smart guy He knows that he shouldn't be caught after escaping five hunred meters The moment when you step out of this doorsill it's likely that you are recognized And what Jean-Louis did have made us closer to this family He's my only uncle a little flabby but we still love him very much Is Mr. Roze there? I am his neighbour My name is Flaunsova Clavih Ah, he's right there Hello, this is a surprise What surprise? Didn't your wife give you a surprise?
