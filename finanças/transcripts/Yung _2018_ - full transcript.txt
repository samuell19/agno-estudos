How was your day at school? Good. What did you do on the weekend? I was out partying with friends... like always. Can I smoke in here? No! Nervous? No. I always said I don't want to live past 30. Life is over after that. I don't think so anymore but... I don't believe... I was never confronted with death. Nobody of my family died yet. So it doesn't feel real to me. I'm so young I can't really take it serious. But I'm not afraid because... the time will come. And when it comes, it just comes. Jana, some more Keta? Joy is here! What? Keta! What? You need K? What? Ketamine? From whom? Joy! So I moved to Berlin in late 2009, because apparently God told my parents that we should move to Berlin to build a church. And it was going well for 2 years. Then all the things with my father happened. Now he is in prison and everything is over. Dude... Oh, I don't want to pee on myself! It looks like a "L". Write something with your piss! Write something! What happened? I don't know... I just can't stand her. She completely freaked out in front of my friends. It's so embarrassing. I'm used to my mum getting crazy but yesterday it was bad again... I can't chill at home. I can't relax. You can always come to my place. Yes, I know. You have to move in with me! Fuck living at home. Did I tell you about this guy from LA? He wrote to me on Instagram. He hosts all these cool parties there. How are we ever gonna get to LA? Have you got no hope? Think positive. We just need to... Let's sell all our drugs and stuff. Then we have enough money. No hands. We have the entire world to ourselves! You can't even speak German anymore! We have the entire world to ourselves! We've got the whole world for us alone! Good Mooor-ning! Baby. Please get up. Let's meet outside. I want to finally start my day. So, hurry up! The risky thing about this drug is, it can really knock you out. Just like this... bam...gone...done! Just like that. But...if you know what you're doing and if you keep an eye on the timing... then it can be the coolest trip! You feel very clear. I don't know... You are just clear, that's why I like it! It's not like Keta... when you feel like blah. Or on Ecstasy... when your teeth are grinding like...uhhh and your eyes are somewhere back here. It's so unattractive. On G you're very... much more straight forward. Can you pass the lighter? Here. Are you hitting this stuff everyday? Well... Sometimes I do. I don't really plan it. It just happens. Sometimes I take it once a day and then not for two days or I take it five days in a row... The other day in the club, I became so horny. One of those nights when you ask yourself... what the hell is going on. She never had something with another girl before, but... she was so fucking wet. Totally like girl-cum. Dude! Really hot! It seems like this drug makes you gay. So many guys who used to be straight and now... and ummh... Now they are bisexual. Maybe you just think everyone is sexy. But I find girls way more attractive. Men can be so disgusting. I know. That's why I prefer girls. It's just better. Maybe you should consider it, too. I do. Everyday. I think about it a lot. But don't order spaghetti if you go out on a date! Nasty. Come here. Wanna lick it off? Yes. I have to puke. Who's that girl? That's Abbie. One of my best friends. How old is she? Tell me something. Is she fucking? Why are you asking? We saw her the other day. Yes, why? Just interested. Do you think she's cute? Uhh, do you like her? Do you want to fuck her or not? Tyrell? You're her type and my cousin, so go for it. Nobody notices that you cut up the drugs? No, why? No, they don't get it. Go and flirt with her. Don't be shy. I would be pissed if I'd find out that you cut the drugs. Stop changing the topic! Better go and fuck Abbie. That's your mission. Or are you still a Virgin... are you? Oh Tyrell! I've tried everything apart from heroin and crack. I've done pretty much everything else. Why? I don't know. I guess at some point in life it's just part of it. Some try it earlier, some later. The people I hang around with... party quite a lot... and sure they take drugs. I don't know anyone who goes to a party sober. Where are we going? We need to go that way. And your friends partied since yesterday? I think for two days already. What are they doing? Just chilling. I don't know. Abbie will be there too? Yes. And call your mum. She wants to know where you are. All these bitches are now twerking and you know I'm home alone, under my sheets start the jerking. On your girl and your mother and father. No fuck, not on your father. I spit these rhymes right out of my ass, because I am who I am and that's no lie. Better don't mess with me and shut your mouth. I gonna kick you in the face like a horse. I'm a disgusting pig and your girlfriend wants my dick. I'll make an ocean into her belly. Sperm! What a fucked up bitch. I come with my gang and you get my dick. Gangbang! Sekt Heil! Sekt Heil comrades! Put your hands in the air, fuckers! Very good. Thank you for coming to the Sektmafla party. Babe, you have something for me? Yes! Coke or Keta? Coke! Perfect, its 50 bucks. You want to try? Its all the same. Sure, lets do it. Take a sip of beer and then some drops. Nah, I'm good. Stop giving him G! Give it to me! Get the fuck outta here! Fuck off! I said fuck off! Look at yourself. Totally fucked up. Relax Bro. Yeah, he had too much eh... of the liquid sex. Most kids don't want to admit they're addicts. I'm not addicted to weed or alcohol. But I do them sometimes. Most kids are high so often, because they don't want to deal with reality. Alex was checking me out the whole time and I was flirting back. It was just a game. And I was super horny, so I fucked Ben's best friend. Whatever! Yeah fuck it. I don't care. Now all his friends are calling me a slut. But it's not my fault. He's not my boyfriend. Do you have a tissue? Um.. hang on. I fuck whoever I like. Everyone is flipping out now. And I'm the bitch. It just happened. What should I say... Anyway, I don't give a fuck. And you know the worst part? It wasn't even sex. The boy has so much potential. You got a tissue? I snotted in it already. As he finally was hard enough to stick it in, he's cumming immediately inside of me. I didn't get anything from it. Straight away? Yes, straight away! He didn't even touch me or anything. Dude! I thought I could teach him a little. Now I've had sex with a sixteen year old, got absolutely nothing out of it. On top of it, I've to listen to all this shit! Blubb3r: Can we meet in privat? I want you to eat me out. Hang on a second. Janaina, what are you doing? I'm watching a TV show. Have you finished your homework? Almost, I just have to read a bit. Dinner will be ready soon. You wanted to teach us something, right? Yes. I just put this in here... Two spoons? One. Two. Three. Now it's stinking. You want some G? GHB? Almost done. Oh shit. Damn, it needs to be in a glass. Darling, you have cooked. Fuck, It needs to be in this glass. Why do you put it in the glass? Because the G would taste like metal when it's getting cold. I've done enough stupid stuff for three lifetimes. It's pretty intense. It's never boring, that's for sure. There's always something going on. We don't sleep much. You can party around the clock here. First there is a pre-hour, then the party, then after-hour and then to the next party and so on. It's an infinite loop. Berlin is like... Berlin is like a giant K-Hole. No wait, I gave you three grams. You gave me 3 halves. We shared every time. Ok, I lost one but it wasn't my fault. Yeah, but you lost it! You can't say I owe you 80 euros! Or is it 70? 25 plus 25 plus 25. That only makes 75. Listen. We shared everything. And from the last gram I only had one line. But you had two dips! Babe, I've got something for you. I see! So you are taking it every day? Baby, you need to take care! Everyone should look after their own thing. At least I'm not a whore. Why do you call me a whore? I thought we know everything about each other. Yes, but... How much do they pay you? 150 euros. Not bad. You know that I need the money. And you know that I need my G. Like I said, each to their own. Don't worry about me and I don't worry about your business. I just don't want you to end up like Micha. Look at me! Do I look like Micha? In the blossom of my youth! Yeah, at the moment... Don't worry about that. Drink! You want to fuck me? Only when I don't have to pay. Of course, darling. I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm always running from one thing to another, to figure out what I'm searching for. But I don't know what I'm searching for. Hello! Cocaine? You want me to leave? You wanna give me the money? Who are you? What was your name, Corinne? You know who I am. No fucking idea who you are. Dude, wanna buy it or not? Sorry, but it's your customer. Not my fault. I have less cash than I'm supposed to. Yes, I know. Ok, I'm almost there. We are going to the festival and get it all worked out. Ok, see you in a minute. Can you wait here? Who stole my lighter, you cunts!? Who took it? I swear to fuck... Oh, it's so disgusting! Bum it! Do it again. Go on, make more. One more. Fuck you! Why did he do that? You didn't even take one sip. I try again. I'll never talk to you again if you don't drink it all. Joy, continue drinking! Looks like shit. This feels like a cat's tongue. No alcohol allowed on this train! Look at him, what a loser. I should become a lesbian But then... no dick anymore. Looks like you never had good sex with a girl? I did, when I was thirteen. I mean really good sex. It was really good. I was like... what the fuck, where is the dick? But then I met this latin girl... and afierwards all was good. I made 500 bucks already. And you? Cool, most money you make with G. Baby, shall we take a walk and check out tents? I'm still young. But I think that I'm bi. I have been with more men than girls, but I'm definitely into girls too. If you have been more with boys, you don't have enough courage to get involved with girls. You don't have any experience. You don't want to make the first move. Wow, really nice! If we had a tent like this at the Fusion Festival... Look, here is a bottle of Vodka. Cigarettes. Cheap. Why don't they have any good stuff? Let's have a 2.0 shot. Don't drink all of it. I still don't get used to the taste of G. Get's worse everytime. I hope they don't come back. We are almost falling out of the tent. Emmy? You fell asleep? Fuck you, that was the G. It's funny to see two worlds collide. The people in the train on their way to work and we're straight out of the club... We're nearly passed out and the people are sitting all polite. We're sitting on the floor of the train and cannot even talk straight, going back to school and in the end still getting our fucking diploma. So all is good. I'm gonna throw up. It's too much. Tyrell is cute, isn't he? Yes, super cute. A little bit young, but so cute. Are you finished? Yep. Ugh, you are disgusting. So good. Even better when it's almost empty. You're so weird. There is this story of a friend of mine. He had this girl who wanted him to spit in her mouth. I wouldn't like that. You say that now! Doesn't sound that nice but you never know. Maybe when you are super horny? Please, baby, spit in my mouth! Again! He can spit somewhere else but not in my mouth. I would like to go down on a girl. Not on one of my friends. Just meet a new girl. Cause I got a very long tongue. You wanna lick her pussy? You got a long tongue? Yeah. Haha, so long! I can touch my nose. I love sex. It's lots of fun for me. But not with people that I don't know. It can be fun too, I also tried it sometimes, but I prefer to have sex with somebody I have a connection with. You want some too? No thanks. Why was it so much more painful than last time? Maybe because we were high? Perfect. Is it done? I only watched one youtube tutorial... but it looks great. Im proud of myself, looks good on you. You are so sweet. Your skin is so soft. You can make more money if you do it more often. That's the plan. How long you want to do this? Five to ten years? No! Only for a little while... until I find something better. I go out of my house, out to drink, I'm freezing in summer. I want to dance. Everyday and get rich. I've swapped my mother. Now I support her. I'm the independent one. It's my time to fly. My life in Berlin. My place with my girls and guys! I'm feeling pretty bad, but that doesn't matter. Blubb3r: I can help her. How? Blubbilr: She cutting herself? Is she suicidal? No... I hope not. She's fine but... if she keeps on doing it... Blubb3r: 250 if we meet. I don't think she would kill herself. But it could happen. I'm not more addicted than Jana. It's not fair to portray me as the fucking junkie. Look at her eyes. She can't even think clearly. You know how stupid that is? I can handle my shit. I can use my brain because I'm not dumb. I know what I'm doing is not good. But I will not keep on like that. If I would be addicted like she is, I would take G everyday. But I don't. I wouldn't say that I'm completely clean, because everytime I go clubbing I do take drugs. When she claims that we've got the same addiction problems, then she just doesn't know what her real problem is. Hey, what's up? All good? As agreed? Yep. Check it out, I've got a bit extra. Do you want it? I've only got 100. I'll see you around. Hey Emmy, where are you? Check the photo I just sent you. You can imagine what happened. I know we didn't see each other lately. But... I need you, and I know that you need me too. Call me back. Yesterday, I was in my swimming pool. Feeling like a millionaire. 34°C we had yesterday, water temperature was 27°C. I have two grandchildren and they're always happy in the pool. They actually just visit me, because of that swimming pool. You can't go to public pools anymore. Niggers everywhere and completly crowded. You're not able to swim there, anymore. A friend of mine who has no children... I invite him over sometimes so that he's happy. When you get old and you have no family, no grandchildren, nothing. Then you're a really poor man. Do you like music? Yes. What kind of music? Techno. Techno? Yes. And do you go clubbing? What is your favorite color? Red. Red is the color of love. My mother knows that I smoke weed and she doesn't like that. She thinks I destroy my future with that. But if she would know about the other drugs... then she would be disappointed. At some point I just have to prove that I know what I'm doing. Of course it's not smart to take drugs but I think that I know what I'm doing. I don't destroy myself. I don't overdo it. But of course she would be disappointed. If I could prove that... it all doesn't interfere with my future and that I can be succesful although I'm smoking weed, then I think she would be fine with that. She thinks I don't have any goals in life. Which might be true in a certain level but it's because I just don't know. So I just have to... I don't know if I'll talk with her about it. But I should. First I have to move out because now she still is in charge.
