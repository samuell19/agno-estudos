- How much further? - How much further? - We're here. - Here? - Not to call you a liar, but not seeing any ruins. Yeah, I'm not going down there. - What is that? - The Aztecs, they believed the human soul is comprised of five parts, five pieces. In order for the devil to take a soul, he needs to obtain all five. We shouldn't be here. We, we gotta go, now. - No, we're not going anywhere. Wow. - We shouldn't be here. - Check it out. - We gotta get out of here. - No. - Leave it. - Welcome. - That's a hell of a face. - We're here. - Oh balls. - Well holy, holy. Welcome home, sis. - Thought he'd outlive us all. - He never stopped asking about you. - I'm sure. - You know just last week he was... - Can I have a second, please? - Sure, fuck it. - You know what's on the other side? The devil. When he comes, and he will come, that's where he'll come from. He will take you, one piece at a time. - Morgan, thought that was you. I ain't seen you since, what? - Graduation. - Heard you was living in the Rotten Apple. - I was. - Hold on. - Sure. - Hey, where are you going? - I gotta flight. - Is that a fucking joke? I can't believe you. I haven't seen you since graduation. - He didn't give me much of a choice, Natalie. - Bullshit. - Whatever. - What now you just breeze in here, pay your respects, and split, just like that? Poof, taillights. - Yeah. - No, no, no, no, no. This shit is not flying, come on. - What's your problem? - Like it or not, we're all that's left. Look, I know you two had your issues, but you have got to let go of your hate. - He disowned me, I wasn't even 18. - What are you doing? - Looks just the same, doesn't it? - I guess, yeah. - I remember when we played The Floor is Lava and I hung from that water pipe there. - Yeah, you kicked off one of Pop's track lights that set off the sprinkler system and cost him a fortune. - I have to go. - He never got over you leaving. - I didn't leave, Natalie. - You just can't keep rolling through life blaming your crap on everybody else. - What do you want from me? - I want you to own your shit. - Noted. - Oh my God. - Morgan. I can take your burden. - Piss off. Freak show. Bingo. - Hey girl. I've been looking for you. My place work for you? - Where do you live? - Close, man, no home. - That works, I got somewhere to be later. Shit, it's stuck. Come on. Oh man. Welcome home. - Okay, okay. I can't, I can't. You got me. I'm gonna get ya, I'm gonna get ya, here I come. - Here we go. I'm rich? What the hell? Creepy ass shit. Time to make the donuts. - Morgan, go play somewhere else. Go find your sister. - Robert, I wanted to revisit our earlier conversation, about my place here. - Oh that is not right. - I can help more. - No. - I can. - No! - Shit. Okay, okay you guys got me. Now why don't we just... Shatterproof you assholes. Fuck you. What? Shit. Wait, will you please hold on a second? Please. Bitch, I'm from Glendale. Where'd you guys go, huh? We were just getting started. Shit. Shit. Come on. You messed with the wrong girl. What the fuck? Ow. Shit. God dammit. Help, help. Hello? What the hell? - I'll take your burden, I want to. - Trust me, there's nothing that you can do. - I want my piece. Oh shit. Shit. What do I do now? Think, think, think. Help. Help me! Anyone? What the hell's going on? - Hey Pumpkin. So I guess if you're hearing this, I guess that means I'm dead. I think it's... - Shit. No. That is not awesome. - That's where it's coming from. It will take you one piece at a time. - I need a drink. Please make this stop. Why is this happening to me? My eye. Not again. It's all backwards. - You should go backwards from here. - I don't think so. Hello, hello? Cruel, isn't it? Backwards. Backwards. Can't catch a break. Natalie? - If you go in there, I can't help you. - This bitch. Two down, three to go. - We can live together in here forever, just the two of us, forever and ever. - Fuck this. What the hell was that? - I was there with you. I've always been behind you. - What is it? - Open it. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. A hundred thank yous and a million. I love you, thank you. - You're welcome honey. And we can live here together, just the two of us. Forever and ever. - Stop it. - Morgan. - What do you want? The keys! - The firstborn has been promised. I'm here to collect. - I'm sorry. - Where am I supposed to go? - Your birthday's Monday. You need to be gone by the weekend. - You can end the cycle. - Do you know what's on the other side of that? - Morgan! - How do I stop this? - There's no way out. - Fuck me. Here we go. Okay the arrow, I gotta get to the safe. How the hell am I gonna get to the safe? Yeah, this'll do. Let's go get that arrow. My leg. This can't be it. Eat this. How do I stop it? You fucker. I beat it. I beat it. That's it. I'm done, I'm not playing any more. Thanks, Dad. I'm not afraid of you. Last one. So what now? - Morgan. One by one the pieces are being swallowed. All mine. Yes. Come. I am wrath. No other can save you, only me. Your father ran, and now he's he's gonna repent. - In there? - Dad? - Hey pumpkin. - What are you? - So I guess if you're, if you're hearing this, I guess that means I'm dead. I think it's, it's only fair that you know that this is all, everything, my fault. I never wanted to send you away. When I was a young man I made a deal. I made a deal to sacrifice something that I never thought that I'd actually have. But once I did I knew I couldn't do it. I couldn't hurt you, I couldn't let anything hurt you. So I pushed you away. I'm not asking you for your forgiveness, I know there's none to be had, not after what I did. I just hope you can let go of it, the hatred in your heart. I love you, Morgan, know that. I do love you, I always have. - The firstborn has been promised. - I'm rich. Wait, wait, wait. How many times? - Five times. - The Devil killed you five times? - Oh, four. - If you don't wanna give me the raise, you should just say so.
