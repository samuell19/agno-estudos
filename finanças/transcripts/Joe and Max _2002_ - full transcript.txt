(crowd cheering) (bell ringing) Radio: We're just moments away from the bell to begin the fourth round here at Madison Square Garden. The first three rounds belong to The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis. He punished the Spaniard, Paolino Uzcudun with every conceivable combination of punches. Referee: One... Crowd: Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Out! Thank god almighty for Joe Louis! And the brown bomber, Joe Louis, moves one step closer to meeting Jimmy Braddock for the heavyweight crown. You sent him, Joe, you sent him. he all right? He'll be fine. Announcer: fans and reporters at ringside stunned at Louis 's awesome display of... I tell you, I seen it all. I never seen nothing like that before. You get what we came for? Hiya, Maxie. Jim Farley! Well, if it isn't Mr. Joe Jacobs, my favorite pain in the ass. I'll take that as a compliment. Listen, you tell your boxing commissioner that Louis is ready for a test. He don't need no more patsies. That was Paolino's first time on the canvas in his entire career. Didn't he fight your boy to a draw last year? Who remembers that far back? Listen, listen, listen closely. Maxie has the key to dropping Louis locked between his ears. Good, most fighters have got plenty of room in there. Listen, you sanction us against him, you'll see. We'll take it under advisement. Commodore hotel, we'll be waiting. Yeah, hiya, Maxie. Mr. Farley. So, what do you think of Louis? Well, he has a locomotive right. With all his talent, he could be the greatest one day. But not this day, eh, Max? I'll see you, Max. I don't think it's impossible to beat Joe Louis. Right, you got what, nine long years on him? You two are here scouting, aren't you? No, we just crossed the pond to get some comfort food at Katz's Deli. Hitler know you're feeding him Jewish food? I see something. What? What do you see, Max? A way to undo Louis? I see something. (knocking on door) it's open. Breakfast in 15 minutes? What the hell are you doing drinking at eight in the morning? Celebrating, and it ain't easy being the life of the party with no party around. What are you celebrating? You and Louis. Winner to meet Braddock for the title. You did it. I did. Hey. You know, my father always said a good salesman doesn't push, he pulls. And boy, was he wrong. Radio announcer: beautiful Pompton Lakes is no vacation getaway for young Joe Louis. The Brown Bomber is blasting his way towards becoming the first negro heavyweight champion since Jack Johnson 23 years ago. The dark dynamiter's sparring partners are the highest paid in the business, and boy, do they earn every penny of it. "send in another one" says Jack Blackburn, Joe's trainer. After every victory, Joltin' Joe is the toast of Harlem, yet he's always welcome at Jack Dempsey's swank Manhattan restaurant. Joe's brought along his beautiful wife Marva, the first lady of colored America. Well, there's Jack now, giving him some pointers on the upcoming Schemling fight. Joe's the friendliest guy you'd ever want to meet, outside the ring, of course. Ah, Marva 's fried chicken, Joe's favorite. It takes a lot of ammo to fuel those fists. Boys, this is a new day for boxing. And Joe Louis is the dawn. You really think that a colored fighter has a shot? This son of a sharecropper spent his youth hauling blocks of ice up Detroit tenements and laboring in the ford plant, all to feed his family. Joe Louis will be as honest and generous a champion as America could dare hope for. You'll have to excuse my Uncle Mike. He's biased. How about a shot of Joe digging into a piece of watermelon? Yeah, how about it, Joe? Yeah , come on! Oh, I don't really care much for watermelon. You love watermelon. Today I don't. Reporter: Ah, come on, why not? What do we say we let the man eat so he can get back to work? Okay, gentlemen, this way. Let's tour the camp. Next thing, you'll have him tap dancing. What was that all about? Uncle Mike gets carried away, but he sure is making us rich. Well, I can't argue with that. I wish you could stay, baby, but you know how Chappie is. Yes, I know how Chappie is. Well, where is Henry with the car? He's supposed to be here. I don't know. I guess you'll be needing a lift. Why don't you take that one over there? For me? It's all yours, doll baby. Oh! Look at this. Oh, it's so beautiful. Just like you baby. Are you sure? A classy woman should be driving her own car. You know what I love? The looks I get when we walk in a joint, and all those people turn in their seats. "Who's that fine looking woman with punchy over there?" You are the sweetest man, Joe Louis. Thank you. Look who's here. I was about to say the same. How are you, David? Fine, the entire salon is here. I'll be right back. Hello, everyone! Max. I missed you, sweetheart. Congratulations, Max, you deserve this fight. Max, how was your trip? A little rough, I still feel a little dizzy. Don't knock it. I pay good money for that feeling. Ladies and gentlemen... It's wonderful. Thank you, it's my only work they'll never ban. [ door closing ] Herr Schemling, your presence is requested. By whom? The Minister of Propaganda. Right now? Yes, Herr Goebbels is waiting for you. But he's only just arrived home. Retired captain David Levin, third batallion, 92nd infantry. Please, we leave at once. Excuse my frankness, Madame, but I must say that I have seen all of your films. You are as lovely in person as in the movies. Sorry I have to rush out like this. Where are we meeting next week? Next week? Paris. Extraordinary, don't you think? Herr Goebbels. Herr Schemling. Titian displayed such clarity of purpose with each brush stroke. I've read of your interest in art. So, you are an avid reader? Please. Do you recall the section of "Mein Kampf" Where the Fuhrer deals with boxing? I'm afraid I don't. He views the sport as a battle not of body, but of will. A determined will is essential. That must explain your setting a fight with a negro without our permission. I'll earn a title fight by beating Joe Louis. I admire your confidence, but the negro is a ten to one favorite in the American newspapers. I suggest you take that wager. I project myself to the day you have fought, and possibly been beaten by, a negro. The Fuhrer will be disappointed on that day. I will win, for Germany. To victory, then. Remembering: What do you see, Maxie? A way to undo Louis? I see something. Louis drops his guard! Counter! Look out! When he drops his left, What do you do? You counter. Counter! He drops his left! Counter! Counter! Yeah, that's it! Hook, hook, hook! Hook, hook, hook! okay, good, good. That's enough for today. Very good work. See you tomorrow. Woman: How much are you going to miss me? You have no idea. Well, at least-- at least training keeps you distracted. Meanwhile, I'm forced to suffer though love scenes with handsome young actors who never quite get it right. We have to do endless takes. Maybe you should come with me to America, then. I like that idea much better. I could learn to box. I bet I could knock you out if I put my mind to it. What is it? I'm just tired. Max, what's wrong? If I lose at my age, I might never get another chance. On June 19, you are going to surprise everyone, except for me. Radio announcer: The Brown bomber looks fit as a fiddle. Joe Louis weighs in exactly 198 pounds. At six foot one and three quarter inches and with 14-inch biceps, it's hard to imagine... different radio announcer: Louis, the magnificent animal. He eats, he sleeps, he fights. Joltin' Joe is nine years younger than Schemling and possesses greater reach and power. Experts believe 31-year-old Schemling's best years are behind him. Max Schemling weighs in exactly 192 pounds. Joe Louis retains the calm and coolness of a gunslinger, paralyzing his opponents before the first round gong. Hi, Joe. How are you? Blood pressure for Joe Louis is 165 over 110, slightly elevated. Good luck to you tonight, Joe. He sure is a cool bird. Max Schemling's blood pressure is 140 over 90, normal. Looks like you got a fight on your hands this time. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, on hand for tonight's bout, the current heavyweight champion of the world, Jimmy Braddock! Fighting out of Germany, weighing in at 192 pounds, the European champion Max Schemling! His very capable opponent, weighing in at 198 pounds, one of the best heavyweights in fistiana, Joe Louis! Radio announcer: 45,000 fans rise to cheer Joe Louis as he's introduced on what should be his final tune-up before he fights Jimmy Braddock for the heavyweight crown. This is it, Max. Give him your calling card right away. Now feel him out some first, huh? See what he's bringing. Here. I'm going to mark this guy. (bell rings) Radio announcer: The undefeated Louis is going for his 24th straight knockout and his 28th straight victory. Louis and Schemling look each other over, very cautious here in the early going. Louis starts working that jab. Schmeling takes it, too old and too slow to defend against it. Louis, with a left to the body, another left, a right and back with a left hook! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Round two. Louis picks up where he left off. Another jab, jab, jab, and a right to the head! Oh! Repeated lefts and rights to the head! Schmeling is little more than a punching bag for the young slugger. I should've stayed in bed. (bell ringing) He can punch. What? You can't? Keep that jab up. Keep working that left eye, got it? Stick and move, stick and move, keep moving, okay? (bell ringing) Radio announcer: Louis is hurting Schemling and this crowd is loving it! Schemling missing on a big right, nearly falling down. Get your hands up! Get your hands up! Finally a brief flurry from Schemling. Louis comes right back, staggering the German. (bell ringing) You're looking real good, that jab is really working. You're hitting him at will. Just make sure that you snap that hand back, got it? Snap it back to your chin, got it? Why don't I just knock him out? God damn it, listen to me! Don't throw that left again if you really hurt him with the right, you got it? Yes, sir. Let's go! What are you doing out there? Five jabs in a row without a single counter punch. What are you waiting on, Maxie? Come on! Shut up, both of you! (bell ringing) Fourth round, Louis is looking to close things out. Louis jabs. Max remembering: when Louis drops his guard, counter. Counter. What do you see, Max? I see something. When Louis drops his guard, you counter! Jab, jab, jab... Get that hand up, get that hand up! Counter! Radio announcer: A big break stuns Louis! Louis goes down! Louis is down! Take an eight count. Joe Louis is on the canvas! Holy smokes! For the first time in his career, Louis has been decked. Take an eight count! The once invincible brown bomber has been knocked down! (crowd chanting) Maxie, Maxie, Maxie, Maxie! Radio announcer: the crowd is more than stunned! They've begun cheering for the German Schemling! (bell ringing) Chants of "Maxie, Maxie, Maxie" boom out through the entire stadium! What are they doing that for? Fuck 'em, fuck 'em fuck 'em! Doesn't mean a damn thing! You shook him up, Max! Now listen to me carefully. Go hard at him from the bell! Listen, you got to knock his ass out, you got it? Knock his ass out! Let's go. (bell ringing) Referee: Whoa, whoa, whoa, back off, back off. Get him, come on. Radio announcer: Schemling wants to end this fight right here, but here comes Joe Louis. No one expected the fight to go this long, or the German warhorse Schemling to prove so game. round six was clearly won by Schemling, but round seven belongs to Joe Louis. Schemling has taken everything Louis has in his arsenal, and given it right back to him. Neither fighter is backing down. Neither fighter is able to put the other down! Maxie! Maxie! Maxie! (bell ringing) He's kicking your black boy's ass! You bring it on! Police are fanning out in the stadium. There's a lot of commotion in the stands. Louis looks tired. Schmeling goes on the offensive. Come on, Joe! The right combination drives Louis back to the ropes. Joe grabs on for dear life! One, two... Louis is down again here in the 12th! I don't know if he'll get back up. The crowd roars for the German Schemling, as Louis lies battered and beaten on the canvas! No! He's not getting back up! You're out! Schmeling has won this fight! Max, great fight, you deserve it! You deserve the shot! (crowd chanting) Maxie! Maxie! Maxie! Chappie? What happened to me? Ah, it's nothing tragic, son. You just got knocked out. Come on. Radio announcer: The once invincible Joe Louis falls, and the quake is heard around the world. (crowd yelling) Up in Harlem, an angry mob is rioting over what many residents there believe must have been a fixed fight. Ringside experts now believe Louis has a glass jaw, and may even be a dumb fighter. They're wondering not just whether Louis has the guts to come back, but whether there will ever be another colored heavyweight champion. Mr. Louis? It'd mean a lot for my boy to meet you. Sure. Introduce yourself, son. Hi, I'm Joe. Joe? You got a fighter's name. Yeah. Is that what you want to be, son? Yes. All right, let's see what you got. You best keep that left up real high, or you're going to get walloped. Take it from me. Now you got it. God bless you, brother. Here he is. Come on, come on. Let's go. Joe, you heard about the reaction in Harlem? Reaction to what? The biggest upset in the history of boxing. A devastated race of people left in your wake. I'm the one that took the beating in there, I don't see how I hurt my people none. There's word of a Harlem girl who drank poison when she heard that you lost. Yep, that's what they're saying. All right, that's it, step aside. Announcement: Attention, all passengers on the 8:15 bound for Detroit should begin boarding now on track 11. Everybody's staring. You're not a movie star, you're a fighter. Oh, baby. Kid better be all right. I ain't going back to running numbers. Just flip your cards and count your pennies. I'll take care of him. It ain't right the way you and Uncle Mike talk to me. I'm the one who discovered Joe. You just riding my coattails, old man. Settle back, John, or this old man will kick your ass. You know, Joe, the first time they told me about you, the first time I seen you, I wanted no part of Joe Louis. Why not? I knew you were too nice to be a champ. Couldn't see you finding that killer instinct. Now, in order for you to go... Chappie, I can't hear this right now. I just can't. (applause and cheering) Thank you. I couldn't wait to come home to you. You've come home to much more than me. Thank you. Crowd: Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! (doorbell buzzing) Good evening, Fraulein. Herr Schemling. Before we leave, I 'll need your signature on this manuscript. "Boxing as a race problem?" Yes. Please sign at the bottom of the forward. Why would I do that? Because you wrote it. We don't want to be late. I'll read it over and sign it another time. Woman: You have so many fans here. When I win. How many people do you think were there when you landed? I don't know, ten, twenty thousand, maybe. They all came because of her. You look quite banged up, Herr Schemling. Oh, you should see the other guy. He only needs one good eye for hunting, which is all he really wants to do anyway. It is an honor to meet you. There are precious few actresses with your talent, and none as pretty. You must be very proud of your husband. I am. I am very proud of her. Isn't it interesting, Herr Schemling, You won the European Championship just as I came to power, and now it seems we're both destined for greater things. Yes. Herr Schemling, at what point were you certain you had him beaten? To be honest, not before Donovan counted him out. You perceived a flaw in the negro's nature, a weakness. The last time I looked at my face, if there was any weakness, it certainly wasn't in his right hand. He was not the same after round four. True. And why not? I stung him with a counter right. Herr Schemling found a flaw in the negro's constitution, and exploited this weakness until he was vanquished. The negro is inferior. He will always be afraid of you. This fight will not be part of the weekly newsreel. It will be shown as a main feature throughout The Reich! Oh, hello, David. I hope I'm not coming inappropriately. Oh, no. Is Max at home? Max, David's here for you. David, how are you? I brought something for you. It just came in and I thought of you. That will be perfect for hunting. Oh, no, this is too nice for hunting. This is beautiful. Thank you, David. Max, would you do something for me the next time you're in the store? Of course, what is it? A matter of professional exactitude. You purchased this suit from me a year ago. I'm uncomfortable with the way the Jacket pulls at the shoulder. If you bring it in, we'll be happy to make the adjustment, free of charge. This Jacket fits me flawlessly. David, occasionally photographs tell half-truths. Half-truths? David, with all those people at the airfield, the streamers and the pageantry, Max just did what he had to. I'll show myself to the door. You didn't have to say that. He had no right to accuse you. He was upset, I can handle that. Max, I'm afraid of our exposure. How many other national figures openly have Jewish friends and business partners? Some of them do. Not anymore. We are different. How? You are a movie star, and I am the most popular athlete in Germany. Look, once I'm champion, what can they do? Let me spell it out for you, Jimmy, plain and simple. You give Schemling a crack at the title, America turns on you. Schmeling beat your boy, he deserves it. Jimmy, no offense, I like you, but we both know your next fight will be your last as champ. You can go to hell, we're out of here. Sit down. So America turns on me if I fight the Nazi, and all the promoters in town turn on me if I give the shot to a negro. I lose either way. Would ten percent of Joe's winnings for the rest of his career make you feel like a winner? For the rest of his career? Why do you want this so bad? The belt goes to Germany, ain't no telling when it's coming back. Fifteen percent. You know what? Go fight the Nazi. And when you lose, my grandkids will read about it in their history books. Now that's ten percent of everything? After my cut. Which is? Thirty-seven percent. You deserve every penny. Good. Thanks. Good. If you can bring us that title, I can take another nip of the sauce. You sure that's a good idea? Oh, the sweet science is going to get real bitter for a while. Oh, careful, son, careful, son. It's going to be me and you, and mostly me. Come on! Plant, pivot, rotate! Why don't you just stop? Stop lying to yourself! You don't want to fight! Why don't you just go home? It's okay, it's okay to give up. Maybe you can get your old job back on the assembly line. Show me something. Rotate, come on! Why don't you just quit and go home? A real fighter wouldn't throw that soft shit, or stand there feeling sorry for himself. Joe: Now, that's a beautiful ring. I have to say, I've got pretty good taste. Surprised you, didn't I? Yes, you did. I've always been partial to diamonds. Marva. I'm going to close my eyes, and when they open, you best be in a taxi back to whichever whorehouse you came from. Hello, Thomas. Mrs. Louis? Excuse me. I won't be embarrassed by you. I refuse to be humiliated. I didn't mean to embarrass you or humiliate you. It's just that... Women are like this menu. Can't expect you to eat steak every night? Baby, what are you doing? What am I doing? What's happened to you? If I'm going to go on being Mrs. Joe Louis, here's how things will be. You will not take any of your lady friends to any of our places, and you will always park in clear view so I'll have no more surprises. And if you're out late, don't you dare come home. Do we understand each other? Excuse me. Remembering: Joe Louis will be as honest and generous a champion as America could dare hope for. There were so many people counting on me. Six a.m. Finds the sepia slugger out for his daily run, knocking off miles as naturally as he knocks out opponents. Chappie, folks used to say I was a natural, but there wasn't a damn thing natural about it. Running six miles at dawn, training all day long, climbing into a ring with somebody who means to hurt you. That's what a crazy man does. You got to decide just how crazy you're going to be. I can't decide for you. Chappie? Good afternoon, sir. Would you please ring Joe Jacobs? Excuse me. Joe Jacobs, please. Herr Jacobs is not a guest here. The law forbids me from honoring his reservation. Why? Herr Jacobs is American. Herr Jacobs is a Jew. His stay will be short. Can an exception be made? Sorry, no. Modesty aside, are you aware of my public stature? I'm well aware, Herr Schemling. Your victory was a golden moment for us all. I would consider it an honor to receive you and your family at my training facilities. Please contact The Ministry of Sports at your convenience. He's in the bar. Thank you. Excuse me, can I get a drink here? Welcome to the continental hotel. Seig Heil. You're all set now. Last woman treated me as bad as her, I married the bitch. Hey, let's have some champagne. Maxie, you won't be getting the title shot. Who are they giving it to? Louis. Louis! What can I say, we was robbed. This is impossible. We didn't get the votes. Farley was the only one who stood up for us. You've been branded, you're Hitler's boy. I'm just an athlete, I'm not a politician. The anti-Nazi league sees it different. What are they calling you? A traitor to my country. Doesn't matter. I'm a businessman and nothing but no one's going to stop me from plying my trade. What's more American than that? Maxie, you just be ready, because when I'm done, those bastards will give you a shot just to shut me up. Remember, Braddock's going to come at you from the bell. He's going to want an Irish brawl, that's the only chance he's got. What are you going to do? Stick and counter, stick and counter. And then? Nothing, until you say shoot. What's that gun? You expecting trouble? Uh-huh. You know, there was another reason why I didn't take you on the first time I saw you. Why is that? You're the wrong color. I didn't think another colored man would contend after Jack Johnson rubbed white folks' noses in it. Chappie, you can't win by a decision tonight. I got to knock him out. Let these be the referee here. So why did you? Why did I what? Take me on. I needed the money. (laughing) D.O.A., dead on your ass. Radio announcer: Here in the 7th round, Joe Louis is trying to become the first negro champion since 1908. Braddock throwing Louis into the ropes. The ring here at Comiskey Park is surrounded by police. Get off the ropes! Come on, Joe, come on! Braddock, manhandling Louis, puts him into the ropes again. Come on, come on. The champ is taunting the young challenger like a playground bully! He's out, he's out. This fight is over! A new world champion! 23-year-old Joe Louis makes history tonight! Ringside announcer: The winner by knockout, and new heavyweight champion of the world, Joe Louis! Hold it up a little higher, Joe. How about a smile? Hey, you really got him with a left. I got him with my right, too. So, Joe, how does it feel to be champ? I'm no champ until I beat Max Schemling. Well, Herr Schemling. This is unexpected. Herr Goebbels, what can I do for you? We would be encouraged to see you join the party. Many months have passed waiting for you to do so. Well, my life is about boxing, that's my priority. You would do well to shift priorities from yourself to the fatherland. Won't the heavyweight championship bring glory to the fatherland? Your professional relationship with Joe Jacobs must be terminated immediately. I've accommodated your wishes. I've been photographed at your request. I've given interviews. I've lent my name for various purposes. But this is out of bounds. The way I conduct my corner is my own business. Not when a Jew is involved. On whose orders am I being told to break ties? On whose orders? Mine. I wish to speak to the Fuhrer. Good day. Madame. Thank you. Mein Fuhrer, I appreciate you seeing us on short notice. Please. Which sort of cake do you prefer? Guglhupf, please. Does the lady mean the napfkuchen? I haven't heard it called guglhupf since I was last in Czechoslovakia. I was raised in Prague. Ah, beautiful old German Prague. The time is fast approaching when your homeland will be reunited with Germany. I understand you wish me to split from my manager, Joe Jacobs. In name, he is Jewish, but his real religion is boxing. More tea? No, thank you. A German manager got me nowhere. Jacobs is my only chance to fight in America. In that case, you will fight here. The title will never come here. I have to win it in America. Allow me to understand you fully. A German's only possibility of becoming the world champion hinges on a Jew's influence? The man is greatly respected in New York. Answer my question. Yes. Yes, what? Yes, I need his influence to get the title. Make sure your husband wins a lot so we can see each other more often. Max! Hey, Max! Your manager calling. Jacobs. So? Maxie, what's the weather doing there? Forget about the weather, what happened? Berlin, sunny one minute, it's snowing the next. I haven't set my foot outside the gym for a week. So why don't you take a break? Come over, we'll go sunbathing at Coney Island, and while you're at it, you might as well fight Joe Louis for the belt. I love you! Max, Max... All right, I got the fight! He's going to be in top form. That's good. Then we're agreed. If Maxie wins, you're our promoter. Hey, what would Joe do if he found out you were playing both sides of the fence? Don't get any smart ideas. Look, Joe protects his chin so he won't get hurt. I'm just doing the same. Wish me luck. Take me with you. You know they would never allow that. Things would be different there. Anny, I could not live anywhere else. This is our home. Good luck, Max. I love you. Reporter: Max Schemling is aiming for the world heavyweight title in the most important sporting event of our time. 2nd reporter: Joe Louis was summoned to the oval office by President Roosevelt and told that America was counting on him against the Nazis, while protesters gathered in major cities across the country to condemn the German propaganda campaign leading up to this fight. (crowd outside chanting) No more Nazis! No more Nazis! You should get something to eat. I'm not hungry. Can you believe what those idiots are doing down there? Help me get this shit out of here, huh? Burn it all! Well, this is a hell of a time you pick to lay down. I spend years breaking my ass to get us here, you're going to let a sea of strangers talk you out of taking that bastard's belt? Those people down there, nothing you say or do is going to change their minds. Roosevelt and Louis have got them convinced you're a Nazi! I'm not a goddamn Nazi! I'm just a fighter. So, your fire ain't dead after all. Just watch what you call me, Joe. Then show everyone who you really are, Maxie, the best fucking fighter in the world. I put him down once, I'll do it again. Reporter: The Nazi superman Schemling says he's ready to lay claim to the title. Joe: every time I get in the ring... every punch I throw... gets me closer to Max Schemling. Max: You know, people said I was lucky to beat Joe Louis the first time around. But on the night of June 22nd, I'll show them luck had nothing to do with it. Reporter: Are you gun-shy about facing Max again? Joe: Why would I be? Schmeling's two years older, and I'm two years smarter. Max: well, I didn't come over here for fun. Reporter: When Joe Louis steps into the ring tonight, he carries the flag of America and democracy. Man: Tonight in Yankee Stadium, with god's help and your prayers, Joe Louis will do more for our race than any man since Abraham Lincoln. Joe Louis don't smoke. Joe Louis don't pour no red-hot liquor down his throat! Joe Louis, the family man. Joe Louis, the avenging angel! Max remembering: Isn't it interesting, Herr Schemling? We are both destined for greater things. I'm just an athlete, not a politician. Man: Joe Louis, the answer to our prayers! Good luck to you tonight, Joe. Man: Joe Louis fights clean and true, and he shall stand before kings! Same to you. Where you going? Chappie, with this damn arthritis, I don't know how many times I can climb up in that ring tonight. Don't worry. If he's still standing by the 4th, come get me because I'll be out of gas. (various languages being spoken) 70,000 strong here in Yankee Stadium, all cheering for Joe Louis. [ all talking at once ] Welcome. Get him, Joe! He's gonna kill you. (crowd booing) Man in crowd: You stink, you lousy Nazi! Radio announcer: Louis starts pounding Schemling with left and right combinations! My god, he almost tore his head off with that one! A left hook. A straight right! Hitting Schemling at will! Move, Max! Get out of there! News announcer: Louis has hit Schemling with more punches in the first minute than he did in any five rounds of their last fight! The Nazi goes down! Louis doesn't go to the neutral corner. He wants Schemling to get back up! The American is ready to hand him his head! I've heard enough. Cut the broadcast! Please stop the fight. (radio switching from fight to music) Stop the fight, Donovan! Maxie! The winner at two minutes and four seconds in round one, and still The Heavyweight Champion of the World, Joe Louis! I'm keeping this, I've earned it. They will always remember you after tonight, champ, because tonight, skin color disappeared. America was behind you. And to keep that feeling alive, you need to act like a gentleman. Joe Louis, the gentleman fighter. Don't you worry. Spotlight's shining now, Joe. If you slip up, even a little bit... once they knock you down, they never let you forget it. White man hasn't forgotten that fool nigger Jack Johnson strutting around with this white women like king shit. Roxie, what you trying to say? No soft fights, no fixed fights. Never stand over a fallen opponent. Don't ever gloat in front of the camera. Never smile like some blackface. I never done that, I never would. You just stay deadpan. Never go into a club alone looking for trouble. Never have your picture taken with a white woman. All right, all right, he's got it. Most important thing is to win. Count on it. We will, Joe, we all will. All right, boys, give him some room, give him some room. Woman singing: Now, in this land, there is a new sensation. All the critics praise him right up to the sky. Why, even up in Harlem, they call him their pride and joy. ♪ But to mom he's just a silly boy ♪ Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! [ song continues ] Joe, we love you! Over here, Joe. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Joe Louis. I am so proud of you, Joe. Champ! Can I get a shot? Just a photograph. I wore your fur tonight. Yeah. ♪ that's Joe the bomber! What can I make you, Joe? Give me something. Bourbon. Yeah. I was listening on the radio. You did a great thing. All right, bro. Put that Nazi where he belongs, in the hospital. What's the biggest tip you ever got? We see lots of big bills here. Not we, I mean you. Oh, I 've held a dollar bill a couple of times. Thank you. One more, one more. (door opening) Who's there? It's me, Joe Louis. I figured I 'd see how you were doing. Come closer. You all right? They say my vertebra cracked in two places. I didn't mean to hurt you like this. Of course you did, that's what we do. Yeah, I guess you're right. The first time I knocked somebody unconscious, I almost quit boxing forever. Tonight I wish you had. I keep replaying this fight in my mind, trying to make it turn out different. Well, now we've both stood over each other. I guess it's going to take one more fight to settle things. The world won't allow that. I don't know when I'm going to be back here, and Europe is no place to visit these days. So we'll wait. First chance either of us gets, we'll come find the other. You have a deal. You take care. Joe, I want you to know... what the papers said about me being a Nazi, claiming to be a superman, all the quotes they had me saying about you... none of it was true. People been telling me who I am all my life. There's no end in sight. I can't live up to all of my press clippings, but they don't want to hear that. The only time they let me be is when I fight. That's when I feel free, between the bells. You get some rest. Hey, Maxie. The city looks harmless from up here, don't it? I love this country, even if it no longer loves me back. Hey, who needs the rest of America when you got yours truly? You're not coming back with me, are you? Well, I got to stay close to weasel a rubber match with Louis. Hey, Maxie, I'm 560 percent Jewish. What business do I got over there? Thanks for having faith in me. That wasn't hard. You never let me down, never. Hey, do me a favor when you get over there, will you? Anything. Give Hitler one of these for me, will you? Consider it done. I don't need an ambulance. Okay, gentlemen, this way. You're never out for the count with a Joe Louis clock. It's quality craftsmanship. Hey, hey, Joe. You want to have a look at this? You see the hands? They're boxing gloves. Next, show me something else. Joe Louis punch. It packs a real wallop. Oh, no, sir. Joe doesn't endorse booze. Oh, no problem. Then we have Joe Louis mustard. When you finish with the mustard, you cut a line here and presto, hey, Joe, a piggybank. Mr. Louis? Very cute, what else you got? Well, how about Joe Louis milk? So it's all here. Where do you want me to put it? Can we make money in milk? What are you talking about? I just need you to sign here at the bottom. Easy now, don't get ahead of yourself. We'll have every kid in America drinking Joe Louis milk while mom and dad relax with a refreshing bottle of Joe Louis punch. Marva! This is all your shit. Marva! Stop! Marva baby, please. Marva, come back to camp. I'm going to take the rest of the week off, the rest of the month off. Please, baby. I'm going to kick everybody out, and you and me, we can just talk things through. Marva, don't leave me, please. Marva, now is our time. Our time? When was it ever our time, Joe? All the gifts, the good life, it was just guilt money for all your whoring. I've tried, Joe, I can't anymore. I was raised with so much of nothing. I had all these wants inside. I wanted this, I wanted that, I wanted everything. I always loved you. I know you love me. People change. Yes... Yes they do. Goodbye. (piano music) (shouting in distance) (knocking on door) Help us! Help us! Follow her. Now, Anny! Open the door! (banging on door) Open the door! Where are they? There's no one here. You know who we're here for. You and you, check this room. You two check the balcony. And the rest with me. My wife is trying to sleep. Your head will roll if the Fuhrer learns about this! This is an empty threat. You no longer exist for Herr Goebbels and the Fuhrer. Get out of my house now! Max, what is going on? Check the other apartments. Say goodbye to Anny. I will. Thank you. We'll see you again. You had no right to do that. Do you know how close we were to going to prison? To losing everything, being split apart? What choice was there? Leave the Levins to The Gestapo? You think that you're untouchable, but you're not. We're just as vulnerable as all the enemies of the Reich. Anny... Why didn't you watch out for us, Max? It would have been so easy just to distance yourself from a few people and join the party quietly. I couldn't do those things. No, I suppose not. That would have been for our benefit. What are you saying? You played along when it suited you. You did whatever was best for your boxing career. If that was true, I would have divorced you and married a pure-blood German. Maybe you should have. Yeah, maybe I should have! For you, being a Nazi is just another part, just another role to play! That's right. I would put on any mask to survive. And don't you think for one second you're any better than me. The whole world thinks you're a Nazi. This is enough! what is happening to us? I know that I'm not untouchable. I'm just as scared as you are. Anny, I know I 've done some things wrong. Can't you see that hiding the Levins was right? The problem is what is right can't help us now. Maximillian Schemling weighs in at 188 pounds. such prominence here today. You must really have some connections, huh? (gunshots) Chappie would never tell me his age. He always said he was just old enough to be my daddy. I keep losing the people I need most. Announcer: It is my distinct honor to introduce to you all a very special man in uniform. Here he is, The Heavyweight Champion of the World, the Brown Bomber himself, sergeant Joe Louis! Joe, you have long been an inspiration to the negro race. Your decision to fight exhibition bouts and to contribute your purses to the army and navy relief societies is a generous bet on patriotism and love of our entire country. I'm only doing what any other red-blooded American would do. Our soldiers are fighting the real fight overseas. And we'll do our part and we will win, because we're on God's side. On God's side! How about that? (baby crying) That's perfect. (announcement from truck) Stand back! Clear the street! Anny: Max, what do you think they want? I don't know. Hello, officers. Would you show us your building permit? I applied for a permit three months ago. We're still waiting. I'm sure ours will be here soon. Allied command does not grant permits to famous Nazis. Every G.I. In Europe was after your god damn dog tags. Now move away from the structure. Move away? Why? Move away from the structure! This place is coming down! You can't do this. You need to step aside. No! Max! Stop! News announcer: Louis sends Wolcott face first to the canvas, the latest member of Joltin' Joe's bum of the month club. The proud champion is bloody, but not bowed. Joe: after 25 title defenses, I hereby am retiring from professional boxing. I figure after 11 years and what is it, Uncle Mike, three days, four days, I'm needing a little rest. I hereby relinquish my title to be held in trust for the man to follow me as Heavyweight Champion of the World. I want to go out on top just like you, champ. I'm finished in the fight game. What are you going to do with your time? What am I going to do with my time? Well, that's simple. You really sent that one, Joe. I'm seeing green, boys. Seeing green. Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking for Mr. Joe Louis. Gentlemen, I prefer large bills. You're cleaning me out, Joe. All right. Excuse me, Mr. Louis? Hey, how you doing? Mr. Louis, my name is Lawrence Paulson. I'm with the Internal Revenue Service. I've left a number of messages. Well, we're about to go through again, give my friends a chance to win their money back. This won't take long. All right. Go on ahead. I'll catch up. We'll see you at the first tee, Joe. One question is all I have, Mr. Louis. Call me Joe. Considering your recent decision to retire from boxing, how do you plan to repay your government? As of this morning, your back taxes and penalties amount to $1,243,097. You should talk to my guys. Mr. Jacobs and John Roxborough register zero debt. We have qualms with neither of them. What about the purses I donated to army and navy relief, don't they count? I fought 96 exhibitions for the troops during the war. I gave to a hundred different charities. Mr. Louis... I said call me Joe, god damn it. You owe taxes on those purses. The IRS simply wants to know how you plan to make amends. Good day, sir. News announcer: Marciano sends Louis sprawling! Joe Louis is hurt, and he's taking every second of that eight count. Here comes Rocky again, couple of weak jabs from Joe. Body shots from Marciano, all landing! Joe tries to fight him off, Marciano is pummeling Joe against the ropes! Marciano stuck Louis through the ropes! He's finished! Joe Louis is finished! Come on. God damn it! I just fixed this thing. Would you get my tool box, please? Farley! How are you, Max? I'm fine, just fine. It's good to see you. Anny, this is Jim Farley from The Boxing Commission. I remember your name. You were always very fair with Max. I tried. So what are you doing all the way out here? Well, I might ask you the same thing. Last I heard, you went back in the ring after the war. Yeah, we bought this with what I made from my last bout. Hey, did you go out a winner? No. Farley: So, I decided it was as good a time as any to get out of the fight game. I've been with Coca-Cola ever since. Two weeks ago, I was in a board meeting in Atlanta and I suggested that we bring you on, Max. The board agreed. In what capacity? Spokesman. The position would entail a handsome salary and a generous travel allowance. We used to love to travel. You must be joking. With all my name brings to mind. Well, back in America, I agree your name may not be regarded kindly, but here, well I think people are going to remember what you did in the ring, not the flag unfurled in the background. This country is desperate for better times. You were a central part of those in the past. Together with Coke, you will be again. I don't know. Max... Max, you can stay hands off. What we really want is your name associated with us when we blitz the German market. Blitz? Oh, yeah, it's just a business term we use nowadays. Coke follows thirst everywhere. That's our new slogan. We followed it here, Maxie. So here's our last mock-up. Now, the essence of the campaign is "Take a break with coke wherever you are." We plan to launch the campaign six weeks from today. So what do you think, Max? I think...I think it looks great. Glad to hear it. Well then, that's enough business. Let's take a break. So tell us what it was like to face Joe Louis. You managed to fight the perfect fight against Joe. Are you talking about the first one or the second one? Joe may have won that battle, but you have won the war. Debt, divorce, you name it. He's going down for the count. You aren't kidding. He's about to fight Cowboy Rocky on the pro wrestling circuit. I think that we might have gone up against a Joe Louis soda in south America or somewhere. It was no contest. So Max, tell us about the fights with Jack Sharky. I think we've tortured Max enough for one day. Let's eat. Thank you. You're welcome, sir. Excuse me, sir, I hate to intrude. See, where I come from, where I grew up that is, folks around the way drummed up some pretty deep hatred for you. But I used to look to Joe, and he ain't never said a bad word about you. So I never did. Joe was a good man. He made me proud, very proud to be black. And proud to be an American. Hey, clear this table, please. Yes, sir. Max: where is Joe living now? Louis? He lives on the south side of Chicago. Max, where are you going? Excuse me. Do you know, by any chance, where I can find Joe Louis? How am I supposed to know where Joe Louis spends his days? Max: I 'm looking for Joe Louis. Do you know where I can find him? Man: Joe Louis? I got no idea. Woman: Joe Louis? Last I heard, he was living somewhere around 81st and Halsted. Operator: I'm sorry, sir, Joe Louis ' number is not listed. Man: Try the Archway Lounge on South Park. If you don't find him there, you got to go club to club. Max: Club to club? Man: It's Saturday, mister. Not that day of the week matters to Joe. (blues music) What you need here? (music stops) I don't want any trouble, mister. Well, you're going to get some trouble if you don't get your ass on out of here, man. Hey! He's with me. Max. Hi, Joe. Thanks. You look great. You, too. I always did love a finely tailored suit. So what brings you to town? I was in Atlanta on business. Atlanta is a long way from Chicago. I wanted to see you. I remember the promise we made to each other. Oh, yeah. So Coke's been good to you. Yeah. Before Farley came along, Anny and I didn't think we'd see another season on the farm. You, a farmer? Yes, a mink farm. I thought we'd make a killing because the coats cost so much. A mink farmer. And they always called you an intelligent fighter. They called me a lot of things. The truth is I moved to the farm to disappear. During the war, every American wanted me dead. And now a few years pass, and Coca-Cola trusts my face to sell their product. There's no sense to it. Sitting here with Joe, it just clicked. I figured out who you was. Now, be cool, brother. Just let us talk. Yeah, sure, Joe, sure. You feel like dancing, Maxie, just let me know. I'll set you up. at least he was offering something and not taking. I'll tell you, I've been carrying people my whole life; Uncle Mike, Roxie, my people, my country. Where did it get me? Chappie always said if you get knocked down, they never let you forget it. Yeah. Sure I can't talk you into staying tonight? Sleep at my place. I wish I could, but I have to get back. Next time. Why don't you come visit Anny and me in Hamburg? Going overseas is steep, the IRS won't allow that. All right, then we put it on my Coke account. All aboard! Still got time for a few rounds. Oh, I don't think so. Third bout would go the distance. Ain't no telling. Last time, I had you out in one. Don't forget '36. I wore you down and down and then out! (laughing) '38 was the best I ever had. '36 was my best. people made a lot of noise when I beat you. Said the world got knocked off its axis, a change was going to come. The poor didn't suddenly strike it rich. The desperate didn't suddenly get a second chance. I'll tell you something, Max, nothing really changed in America. Except it gained a hero. Goodbye, Joe. Goodbye, Max. ♪
