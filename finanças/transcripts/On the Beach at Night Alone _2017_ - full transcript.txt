I always visit them when I travel. Right. And the sausages are great. I just love it here, I want to come tomorrow! - They aren't open then. - Really? Just three times a week. On this trip I've liked the market and the park the best. Good, then let's stop at the park after this. The park first, and then the house? I thought we could go a bit late. Really? You know this was picked as the best city to live in? - Really? - Yeah. They did a poll last year, and it was the #1 city where people wanted to live. Is that so? Funny, right? That's where we are now. - I'm lucky. - Yeah. How did you end up here? It was because of Paul. The one we're seeing today? It was him? I was in touch with him when I was leaving Seoul. He said it's beautiful here, that I should come. It's not like I know anyone in any other country. So I came here. Should I live here too? What? I'd like to. I've no reason to go back. Sure, give it a try. Should I live together with you? Shall we? Not sure about that. Not sure? Why, you don't want to? No, it's not that. I'm the kind of person who needs to live alone. For 10 years you were happy with your husband. Was I? That was out of necessity. - Not because you wanted to? - Right. - Honestly? - Yeah. I thought I needed a husband and he was nice enough. But we lived in separate rooms almost from the start. Really? You don't want to live with me? I don't know if he will. If he does, he does. If not, fine. I won't wait, Let him come if he wants. Sure. He knows where I am. I don't think he'll come, you said he's married? So, he won't come? Yeah, he's married. It didn't stop your husband. I'm different, I have no desire. No, that's not true. But it's weak. I hope he's happy. I feel a bit sorry, actually. You're an odd person. Am I? Sure, you have more desire. More than you, I'm sure. Hello! What time is it? Do you know what time it is? You don't know what time it is? You don't have a phone or anything? All right. I heard vacation was starting. It's really closed. It's vacation? Where should we go? - I was going to have soup. - They sell soup here? Vegetable soup, it's really good. That would have been nice. But vacation starts so early? It's important to people here. They take it seriously. Don't you need to eat? You must be hungry. No, I'm fine. Shouldn't you eat before visiting him? No, I'm fine! Isn't this nice? Let's come back for sure. - Sure. - It's so pretty. It's like a fairy tale cottage. - Let's go. - Okay. It's be great to come walk here every day. Being here with you is really nice. People here are blessed to have this place to enjoy. Still, it's lonely walking alone. Right. Even more lonely, in a beautiful landscape. That's right. Why did you bow before, can I ask? Before crossing the bridge, To try resolving what it is I really want. Just a prayer. What is it that you want? What I want is to live in a way that suits me. To be strong, and whatever happens, to live my own way. That's what I decided. That's good. I thought you were missing that guy again. He's only human... If it can't work, there's nothing I can do. Why did you break up? You know how direct I am, so sometimes... In some ways, it was too hard for me. Men have a hard time with that. - You're quite direct. - So are you. Thank you. That's all it is. Honesty is important. Is it? He's got a kid. Kids are like an inescapable destiny. That's what they say. But he says he's coming? He sent an email. Said he'll come, definitely. I don't know. Who knows. Do you love him? I like him. I love him. Still, if it's too hard, what can I do? I can't stake everything on him. When's he coming? This Saturday, he said. Saturday is quite soon. On the 6:30 flight. The same flight that I took. Not much time left. He'll be here soon. Who knows if he'll really come. Why? The situation keeps changing. He's not an easy person either. He's sensitive. Who knows. Guess it's hard on him too. What is? It's shameful to say. Anyway, I won't wait for him. If he really comes, then i'll see him. I'll decide then. That guy's coming. It's really him. - Let's run away. - Let's go. Are these books in English? There are a few. I bought some. You did? Maybe I'll buy a book. - Won't we be late? - It's okay. The owner here is really nice. He has cancer. But he never shows it, he's so brave. Really? That's so sad. He's a composer, and he writes song for kids. - Really? - It's quite touching. - Shall we go in? - Sure. - They have places like this here? - What? Drink this. Have to wait a bit longer. The water's good. It's refreshing. I'm glad. Aren't you hungry? You must be hungry. I ate a sausage, but you only had one bite. Actually I'm okay now. We'll eat soon. You must be starving. That's a long phone call. I guess she's busy. She always looked tired. Really? Paul seems nice. I bet she walks all over him. - You think so? - Yeah. She controls him completely, don't you think? He's nice. So he treats women well. He's kind. Right, men here are kind. They're gentle. Gentle? Why is his face so red? Is it? He's totally blushing. It wasn't that way earlier. It wasn't? You see things like that well. I never notice. I'm good at seeing things. Right. I'll get you some more. I'll come too. Why don't you say anything? What would I say? I'm the only one talking, it's so hard. It's ready. I thought you were close to them? I just can't get myself to talk in front of English speakers. Really? I just say whatever. Right, that's how you improve. - Your English is good. - No it's not! Now I think I'll study seriously. You'll need to read a lot then you'll write well. And if you listen a lot, you'll speak well too. So read the books you bought. I'll take that. - Speak! - No, I can't. Younghee! What are you drawing? A face. Who is it? Him. You drew it well. - He's that good-looking? - Yeah. He doesn't look like this. But it's a bit similar. No hair? Right. It fell out, he's bald. Seriously? I don't know. How old is he anyway? He's not at all bald, it's just starting a bit. So he's not totally bald? That's a relief. I don't care about men's looks anymore. It's not important. Really? That's unexpected. Good-looking guys are all vain. You dated a lot of good-looking guys? Yeah, I did. I really played around. Good for you. I never played around. When will I get the chance? Do whatever you want. Before you die, do everything. I don't know, I'm old now. So don't waste your time. I really envy you. I really miss him. Is he thinking of me too? I don't know. Just a minute. Okay. It's cold, right? Yeah, it is! We should go. Sure, tell them let's go. Kim Minhee Kwan Haehyo Jung Jaeyoung Moon Sungkeun Song Seonmi Ahn Jarhong Park Yeaju - Hey... - Yes? You ignoring me? - Me? - Yeah. What is it? Don't you know me? Of course I know you. Do I scare you? Why avoid me? I'm not avoiding you, I was looking at the schedule. Really? I kept looking at you. I work here. Really? What kind of work? What do you think? - Maybe, programming? - That's right. So you live here now? You visited here before! - Yes, I came a few years ago. - Right. Did you go to BongBong? You saw Myungsoo? No, I didn't. I was watching a film. - I came to see Junhee. - Oh, Junhee? I see. I had some extra time. Junhee goes back and forth. I thought so. She's in Gangneung now. I know. I saw her. We talked a few days ago. You look younger. Really? Thanks. You were abroad? Yes. And you're back for good? I don't know yet. You look more mature. A bit older. Like a woman, now. Stop it. You've gotten younger. Why'd you come here? I called Junhee after coming back, and she suggested going to the winter sea. I really wanted to see the sea in winter. Yes, it's beautiful here. It's really nice. I guess it is. If they picked the prettiest cities in Korea, it's probably #1. What? You don't think so? It is, probably. - What did you do abroad? - Me? I just... was there, it was nice. I heard the rumors. What rumors? Rumors about you. What rumors did you hear? You had an affair with a married guy, disappeared for a while, went abroad, all that. Is it true? Guess it must be. Don't be offended. I'm not offended. But did he stop making films? Why no news about him? Well, I don't really know. You were gone for too long. Yes, it was long. Will you work again? I don't know. I'm just back to see my mom and dad. You're really talented. You must know that. You shouldn't quit work because of that. I didn't quit. You didn't? That's good. Want to have a coffee? At BongBong? You can see Myungsoo. You have time? Myungsoo works there? You came before, didn't you? Yes, a few years ago. Then why keep talking like you don't know? I never knew Myungsoo works there. You didn't? We started it with him. The four of us. - Is that so? - Yeah. Anyway, let's go for coffee. Sure, let's go. There's something I need to tell you. Really? - Let's go. - Okay. It's nicer than I thought here. Really? Should I live in Gangneung, too? Think about it. Maybe I will. I'm totally fed up with Seoul, but shouldn't you work there? I don't know, Seoul's not good for me. Think about it. It's not something to be impulsive about. The situation should be right for you. When will you meet Junhee? I sent a message. Yeah? I know where she is. - She's working? - Yes. Work is important. I need to work, too. No sign of Myngsoo. When is Myungsoo coming? He texted me. He's coming soon. I need to go now. I'll come back later, then. - Okay, sure. - Yes. Go ahead. Yeah, I'll head off. When Junhee comes, let's all have a drink together. Yes, sure. See you later. Think about what I said, okay? I'm serious! - Let go, you're hurting me! - Sorry. See you later. Wait for me. I might have to go. Come on. Bye. Goodbye. When the wind blows, and the sky is dark, when I yearn for the sight of you, When the wind blows, and I'm feeling sad, thinking of beautiful you. Are you doing well? Do you live happily? Can you see my heart? Why has my mind fallen into this state? Can you see my heart? Why has my mind fallen into this state? Did you wait long? - You made it? - Yeah. - What time is it? - I didn't wait long. I didn't know it was so late. You okay? It's so cold today. No it isn't, it's warm. But it's cold. I'm really cold. I waited exactly an hour. Sorry about that. How have you been? How did it turn out? How did what? I mean, how have you been? I've been fine. Have you been well? Me? So-so. - I'll go to the bathroom. - Sure. - Want something warm? - Yeah, great. Why's a big guy like you feeling cold? Because it's cold, that's why. May I have some more coffee? Yes, just a minute. - How's the coffee? - It's fine. It's good. I'm glad. So how long have you been back? You face has really changed. - You look older. - Really? Well, I am old. You've gotten dark. Your skin used to be whiter. You think? I don't think I've changed. No, you've gotten darker. Do you get health checks? No. Once, a long time ago. What year was it...? Was everything okay? Yeah, nothing in particular. My blood sugar was a bit high, and my blood pressure. But nothing major at all. That can be dangerous. All right. And you, is your health okay? I'm still young, I'm fine. How old are you? I'm old too. Give me a break. How old are you really? If you forget every time, why ask? I'm just curious. You should get married, have a kid before it's too late. Me? I've got no man. Oh, really? Yes. Men are all idiots. - Really? Idiots? - Yes, idiots. Yeah, you're right. Are you going to marry? Why? That woman there, she looks like your wife. No, she's not my wife. We're just close. Then you're just friends? We're friends. It's been a while. What do you mean? I saw you not long ago. Did you? Would you come help me? Wash the dishes, sort the beans. I do all the work here. Don't be so thoughtless. All right, I'll do it. Are we just friends? What do you mean? That's what you said. We're just friends? You can say we're friends. We're friendly, right? That makes us friends. Now you're playing with words? Wash the dishes now! Friends should help each other. Or think of me as a maid. All right, I'll do it. Got a headache? A bit. He always whines about his head. Every day. But he still drinks himself stupid. Stop it, will you? It really hurts. - Do you have pain relievers? - No, I'm fine. I've got some. It looks really painful. A bit. Want some air? Let's go outside for some air. Shall we? You want to see upstairs? What's upstairs? Nothing now, but it used to be a gallery and concert space. - Want to see? - Really? I'll see it next time. Really? Are you hungry? Want to eat? - I am a bit hungry. - Then... Sort these. All right. I'll do it soon. What do you mean, soon? Do it now! Sort them so we can roast. We're not going to roast them? Sure, all right. I'll do it soon. Okay, you're right. I'll do it now. I'll go have a smoke. It's too noisy here. Hurry up. Are we really out of beans? Go look, we're out. Go look yourself. Isn't this your job? All right, I'll do it now. Give me the sheet. Eat when you're done. What's to eat? I brought tuna kimbap. Sounds good. If you want something hot, I can buy noodles. Noodles would be good. Choose one, then. We can put kimbap in the fridge and have it for dinner. We could. What should we eat? You decide. What are you doing? Yes? - I finished the beans. - They're all sorted? - You're hungry? - A bit. Let's not wait for Junhee, we can eat now. I agree. Younghee. Here. - Just a little, I'm drunk. - You feeling drunk? My head is spinning a little. I hardly ever drink, so it goes right to my head. You haven't been drinking? Not many occasions to drink there. -Want some? - Yeah. But you've developed a real charm. You know that? - Me? - Yeah. She's always been pretty. A true beauty. I didn't say beauty, I said charm. Her emotional struggle changed something inside her. I don't know. No, it's true. Something's different. I said so earlier, that you look mature. - She's become very womanly. - That's right. Even if I struggle, I don't get prettier. What are you talking about, really? He caused me so much struggle, I've gotten older. I did? You're charming, we all know that. Really? - Am I really charming? - Of course! Charming how? A strong personality. - Really? - Yeah. Totally strong, I agree. - All right! - Drink up. You happy? Younghee. What was most fun there? Most fun? I walked a lot every day. There's a park. I really liked it there. And a bakery too. I spent hours there each day. On my way home, I bought fried fish in cartons. So I ate like that, economizing on coffee to save money. - Oh my. - Is that so? It was the same every day. But it was so peaceful. Things I couldn't feel in Seoul, I began to feel there, bit by bit. Sometimes the loneliness made me tremble. But there's pleasure in that too. Did you meet any guys? Guess so. Tell us. Guys who approached me? There were a lot. In the bakery or on the street. But it was just so predictable I couldn't do it. Why not? You've got desire, too. Sure I do. I did slip up once. Actually a few times, but... It'll ruin me if I don't stop. If I'm going to die, do it graciously. That's the feeling that came to me. Hey, how are the guys there? Aren't they better than guys here? - Guys are all the same. - No they aren't. They have nice bodies. And they're kind. And big down there. Really? Wait, are they really big? - Stop. - Quiet, you. Really big. No comparison. Really? So it is... It's really true. They have nice bodies, but inside they're the same. Men all want the same thing. - But did you really hold back? - I didn't hold back. But if I meet guys that way, I worry that later I'll end up a strange, man-obsessed woman, like a monster. Die graciously! Are you still searching for love? Where's love? It's not even visible. You need to see it in order to search for it. You know how charming you are? - I'm not charming. - Stop it! You really are. Anyway, I've tried everything. I've really done it all. When I die, I just want to die. Well... I don't want to think of worthless things. I can just die anytime. I'd like to just fade away graciously. lt's 100 times better! Younghee, I've thought that way too. But isn't it better to live? That's why everyone keeps living. It's not according to your thought, but just a will to live. Don't pretend to be wise. Always floundering in thoughts. Who, me? You can't love, so you cling to life, right? Because you can't love for real, you take that at least. Am I wrong? That's what I do? But you can't love. You know? You're not capable of love, or don't deserve to be loved. But we all sing about love. Have you ever really seen a person qualified to love? You need a qualification? Can't we just love? Why get hung up on qualifications? So people with nothing, they aren't allowed to love? If you don't know anything, keep your mouth shut. Younghee's drunk. Keep my mouth shut? You shouldn't speak that way. Don't you start, too. Just keep your mouth shut! None of you are qualified! Everyone's cowardly, satisfied with fake things, and engaging in dirty acts. You're all happy living that way. You're not qualified to love! What will you do? Who's going to love you? What? Who's going to love such a pretty girl? You. Let's love each other. We can do that, can't we? Shall we? Let's do that. I'm not qualified to love, but I will. No, you can love. Let's get rid of all the men, and love each other. I want to kiss you. Can I kiss you? Shall we? That's nice. Once again. I'm liking this. Us too! What do you mean? Why are you doing this? What's with you? Hey! Oh, my. Stop this, let's drink. I'm feeling left out. You feel sad? Give me a kiss? You're not qualified. But I want to kiss. Do it with your cup. It's your lips anyway. Whatever. We're having fun! Isn't this fun? It's great to see you all again. - It really is. - Me too. Don't go, just live here. Should I? Should I live here? Sure. Forget all men. I'll be your friend. - You'll be my friend? - Sure, friends for life. Junhee, this won't do. Give me a kiss. Forget it, let's run away. Now my feelings are hurt. Let's go, quick. You know, I've been... That poet, Park Jongha. It's not that Park Jongha, right? - I don't think so. - Right? Cast it off. Stifling love too must be cast and thrown off. The longing that grips you, scrub and wash it away. The restless pain of separation And the greater anguish of meeting. Cast it from your mind, Peel it off and throw it to the wind. Why does Myungsoo look so weak? After meeting that woman he suddenly got old. He looks like he's given up. So that's it. But everyone's moving here from Seoul. They can't survive in Seoul. Same with me. No, I think you're different. I can't survive either. All failures... The jerks who succeed, who show off, they're all failures. I don't know about success and failure. Yeah, what's success? It's just an expression. Did you want success? No, I just wanted to enjoy life. I didn't want success. But in the end, people make you run like that. What I really wanted was to pursue something passionately. - Like study. - I want to study, too. I never had the chance, but now I want to. - Studying clears your mind. - Right, it does! I want to be with you forever. I wish you wouldn't go back! Thank you. Thanks so much. No, I'm thankful to you. It was my first kiss with a woman! Me too. It felt weird! But it was fun. - No more kisses, now. - Okay. All right. Younghee... This is the money you loaned me. I kept meaning to pay you back. Sorry I'm late. You remembered that? I kept meaning to pay, and kept forgetting. Sorry. So I added a bit of interest. Seriously? It's not much. Buy a present. To commemorate your return. How much did you add? It's not much. Just another $100. I borrowed $400 back then? Right. I had forgotten it. Sorry for being so late. Not at all. I'll buy a present, thanks. It's nothing. - You got money! - Yes! It's cold, let's go in. Yeah. Let's go. - Come on. - I'll just smoke a cigarette. Okay. - Thank you. - No, it's nothing. It's cold out there. What's with her? - She got money. - I got money! Myungsoo had borrowed $400, and he paid back an extra $100. - Did you remember? - No, I'd forgotten. - They have places like this here? - It's nice, isn't it? Such a big hotel for such a secluded place. Yes, I thought the same. - Which floor? - Just a second. - Room 311. Third floor. - Okay. Hey, this room's pretty. It's nice. It's big. Bigger than the room I had before. Really? It feels too big to use myself. No, it's fine. It's the same price. It's really cheap with the discount. Still, it's huge. The smaller rooms are all out, but this is the same price. - Thanks, Junhee! - It's nothing. This is so nice, I can see the ocean. That's refreshing. - Isn't it? - Yes, it's great. There are three rooms. Too big to use alone. - Really? Three rooms? - Yes, three. It'll be scary at night. It might be. It's got everything here. - No electric range? - It's not in the cupboard? Why isn't it here? We'll have to buy some things. Water and snacks. Shall we? Is there a store near by? Yes, a convenience store downstairs. You hungry? A bit. Should we buy something? Let's. You stay, we'll be right back. - Really? I can come. - No, just relax. - Okay. - You want anything? Would you buy me a beer? Let's drink beers. During the day? After last night? Drinking a little will make us feel better. As you wish. Do you need anything else? Something hot. If there's porridge, buy some. - All right. - Thanks. See you. I've come to really like apples these days. - You didn't like them before? - No. I couldn't stand anything sour. I only ate sweet fruit. Let me try one. It's sweet. - Isn't it? - Yeah. I'm thinking about working with Younghee. She's got no agency, so I can answer the phone, or drive. I can do that. Sure, you can do that well. You help her get started. I'd like to keep doing it. I've done enough at my current job. I think I can go on with Younghee forever. That would be nice. You're a good match. - I think so. - Yeah. I hope it works. But she agreed to move back? That's what she told me. Good for her. What happened to that director? You hear anything? The guy she dated. Don't think he's making films. Did he move to Jeju? I think I heard that. A friend of mine saw him, and said he's totally fallen apart. - Really? - Yeah. He's fallen apart? She said he looked like a total wreck. Oh my... They really liked each other? Seeing what they did? Yeah. But why such a fuss? Just leave them alone, why stir up such a fuss? People have nothing to do. And it's adultery. People must've had fun, raking them over the coals. They can act cruel, but two people in love is immoral? I feel bad for Younghee. Let's be good to her. I'll be her friend for life. Sure, you do that. Thank you. You're welcome. - It's good. - Is it? I think it's better than before. Korean beer is much better now. - Right. - That's right. It's good. It really is. I'm glad. - Shall we toast? - Shall we? - Let's. - Okay. To what? Her return! Cheers. - Okay, cheers. - Cheers. - Welcome back. - Thank you. I'll go cook some spam. - Okay. - Really? - Want help? - Yes. Tomorrow I'll come as soon as I can. Okay. But it'll probably be 2:00. You can just sleep here... I was planning to. Damn. I just can't cancel tonight's appointment. - Sorry. - No need to say sorry. What'll you do? It's fine, I'll take a walk, or read a book. Really? I read a lot these days. It's fun. Sure, read a lot. It's good for you. Recommend me some books. Sure, I will. Visit bookstores often. Make it a habit, then you'll find good books. And buy what you'll read for sure, and dig into them. Attack books like you're fighting. Don't read them casually. Right, we mustn't be superficial. You're so smart. You're the smart one. No, you're smart, not me. No, you're smart. You're really smart. You're instinctually smart. - Instinctually? - Yes. Thanks. - It's all done. - Really? Put them here. Thanks. Wake up. It's dangerous. What is it? I'm An Seunghee. His assistant director. Do you remember me? Yes, I do. Funny seeing you here. We saw you before. You didn't notice us? I saw you starting a fire. But what are you doing here? Location hunting. Arrived yesterday. Out here in this cold... It's nothing. Thanks for what you did then. No, it was no big deal. Want to stand by the fire? You look cold. Shall I? Who's there? The second ADs and the production team. Nobody there knows. Go on, you must be cold. - Shall I? - Yes. But how'd you know I was here? We didn't. - You didn't, right? - Right. This is too funny. Isn't it? Is the director doing well? He finished the screenplay, and cast one actor. We hope to start shooting next month. I see. How is his health? It wasn't very good, but it improved a lot. For a year he had awful headaches, but now he's able to shoot again. Did he come with you? - Yes, he did. - Really? I see. Where is he? Is he here now? It's only us here. After eating we decided to have a beer by the sea. The director stayed in the motel to rest. I see... Hello! Oh, we were right. Yes, hello. - Good to see you. - Yes, it is. Hello. We were worried, seeing you lying there. You were worried? Yes, it's so cold. I've heard so much about you. I'm a real fan. Oh really? What do you do? This time, script supervisor. I see. So you'll shoot here? - Yes. - Yes. Here and in Gangneung, mostly. I see. And what do you do? I'm a second AD. You look a bit old, you're still second AD? I am really old. I wanted to work with the director. Just one more time. I'm Kang Sungwoo, production team. I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you. He really is a huge fan. He likes you a lot. - Really? - Yes. Won't you shoot more films? I want to see your acting. Yes, I'd like to. Not sure how I'll do. You'll do well. You really will. Do it for sure. Here, have one. A beer? I don't like beer much. I'll take one. These days, the beer has gotten better. Yes, it's true. Where's mine? Here it is. Shall we? - It's nice and warm here. - Yes. - Let's toast! - Yes. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Tastes good. - Does it? Yes, it does. - Is she coming? - Yes. - I'm coming. - Okay. - You have the key to his room? - Yeah. - Why? - He said to bring a book. Which book? - The one in his room. - I see. Want to go together? I'd like that. Let's go. Okay. I've heard so much about you. What did you hear? He praised you a lot. Said you're a great actress. That's not like him. He never praises anyone. I don't? That's not true. No, you never do. Do I not praise anyone? You do. You praise people often. See, they agree. Why are you making stuff up? What praise did he give me? That you're a very talented actress. He always says so, and... it's such a shame you don't act. You said that? Yeah. What do you mean, a shame? It's true. I'm going to shoot a film. I received a script, when I was there. Really? When? A while back. I said I wouldn't do it. - Why not? - It's garbage. Who's the director? I don't know. It's a debut director, desperate to make money. Good job. You'll get another. I'll have to take anything later. If no scripts come. Why wouldn't you receive scripts? I think you know the reason. I'm a bomb, a bomb! What do you mean, a bomb? - I've got a destructive side. - No you don't. I'm destructive! I harass people and destroy everything! It seems she's having a tough day today. No, I'm like this every day. Thank you, Director. Why, all of a sudden? Just, for everything. You loved me so much! So I'm thankful. It was because you're so pretty. I'm pretty? Am I really pretty? Of course... Isn't she? She's Pretty. Very pretty. Then, am I prettier than Mari here? Of course you are. The script girl is pretty too. Why so many pretty women around you? I like working with pretty people. Younghee, you're pretty. You're really pretty. I don't feel very grateful. You've gotten older. Have I? You're like a grandfather, all of a sudden. But you're just as pretty as before. I'm older too. I've gotten older? Director, here's the book. Okay, thanks. Which book? You said you like books these days. So I thought of this. You're giving it to me? Yes, well... in a bit. Will you? You must cherish the book, to hide it like that. You don't need to give it to me. I will. I think you'll need it. - Really? - Yeah. You got a girlfriend these days? No. I'll just make films, nothing else. - Really? - Yes. So what film are you going to make? About a person I've loved. It's just going to be shaped by that experience. Personal stories are boring. It's boring to talk about yourself all the time, isn't it? But it's also important how it's made. That's right. The subject isn't important. - Really? - Yes. How are you going to make it? Just as the thought comes to me. To not set anything in advance. So I shoot the first scene and go where it takes me... Why do you make those films? Why make it about someone you loved? Trying to lessen your torment? My torment? Perhaps. Are you tormented? Yes, a bit. I haven't been normal since then. No. You seem normal. Even shooting films. I make films but I'm not normal! I've been turning into a monster. - Don't be a monster! - So I'm trying to cast that off. I need to cast off my regrets. You regret it? Do you really regret it? Yes, I do. I constantly regret it. Every day, so much it makes me sick. Don't regret it! Regretting won't change anything. What if I can't stop regretting? This pain, this constant regret... You think I want this? But with time... ...it turns sweet, so I don't want to go back. I just want to die with my regret. I can't breathe... You want to read this? No, I'll read it to you. I really wanted to read this to you. Listen. "The time has come to separate. When our eyes met in that cabin our self-restraint deserted us. I took her in my arms, she pressed her face to my breast. Tears flowed from her eyes. Kissing her face, shoulders, and tear-soaked hands, we were truly... unhappy. I confessed my love for her, and with a burning pain in my heart I realized how unnecessary, how petty and how deceptive all that had hindered us from loving was. When you love, you must, in your reasonings about that love, start from what is highest, from what is more important than happiness or unhappiness, or that sin or virtue in their accepted meaning, otherwise... you must not reason at all, I realized then." Give me the book. Here? Yes. Did you like it? Isn't it good? - It's great. - Yes. - My reading was poor. - Not at all. It was good. You're giving it to me? I'll go smoke a cigarette. Wasn't that a good passage? - It was really great. - Yes. Wake up! It's dangerous. What is it? Wake up. You'll get yourself in trouble. All right. Hurry and get up. Yes, I'm getting up. You're okay, right? Yes, thank you. I was watching you, but you slept so long. I was alarmed. - You were alarmed? - Yes, a bit. Nobody sleeps like that. - Thought you were drunk. - Really? I was dreaming. Were you? You're really okay? Yes, I think so. - Okay then. - Thank you.
