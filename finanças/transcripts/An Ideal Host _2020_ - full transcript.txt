Yes! Yes. Oh my God, yes. No. Shit. What was it? Is it the hands that... the hands are too much, - I'll turn them down. - And the face. - Okay. - And it's a little bit loud. Well, you wanted bold choices. Yeah, but you might have overshot the runway little bit. Okay. Let's go again. - From? - From the top. I'm gonna get this, just walk me into it. Okay. - We're post-dinner... - Pre-dessert. Everyone's a bit tipsy. But not on the good wine yet. Because we wanna sadly lower their expectations before breaking out the expensive stuff. - Right. - I'll sit back and say something nice, like, that was great. I'll offer to go and get dessert. Say it. I'll go and get dessert. Good. Mara will offer to help. - Thank you, Mara. - Be serious. Thank you, Mara. Good. Then say something like, No, it's fine, I can do it myself so that I can say... yes, you can, but you don't have to. Less is more. There it is. Mara will squeal. Kyle will say something like, "Gross, guys," but inside he will be super jealous. Kyle's plus one will not say anything because he's probably still learning how to form full sentences. And then Brett will call for quiet. - Cause Brett's the best. - And then showtime. Elizabeth. Yes. This is a surprise, I know. Ten years together, I bet you thought this day would never come. Your patience is a quality I admire so much. You always put other people's needs ahead of your own, but today Liz, is all about you and how much I love you. Elizabeth Elroy, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife? Yes. Yes. Oh, my God. Yes. - How is that? - Still has this hint of terror. Okay. What if I tried something like, um, like... like this. Like, oh, I'm... I'm so surprised I can't look at you, like... and then that way people won't see the... - Yeah. - Terror? Yeah, that... that could work... - that could work. - Great. - We've got it. Cut, print. - Look maybe we could... Hm? No it's... it's fine, it's fine. They're gonna love it. - Yeah, of course they will. - They love us. Right. Well, big day tomorrow. I'm gonna hit the hay, you coming? Oh, no. Not yet. Still got a lot of prep to do, - so I'll be up for a while. - Oh, you make me feel guilty. Goodnight. Wow. - You like it? - It's amazing. - Is that... - Citrus and lavender. I couldn't decide between them so I lit both, and then I figured that was probably overkill. So I threw them out and I went with a vanilla bean diffuser. And you made place cards. Plus a little schedule to keep things running smoothly. "5:00 pm, tour the property. 5:30 pm, wine and cheese with sunset. 7:00 pm, dinner. 8:45 pm, dessert." I like the winky emoji. "9:30 pm, break out the good wine. 10:00 pm, games. 2:00 am, bedtime. 2:15 am, Clean and prep breakfast. 7:00 am, rise and shine breakfast time. 8:00 am, eat breakfast. 10:00 am, everybody goes home wishing they were us." And then we get to do it all again for your parents. I'm glad we get a little practice run before we hit that obstacle course. Well, let's not worry about that right now. Let's just worry about tonight. I'm not worried. Everything's gonna be perfect. We've planned it all. We've thought of everything. What is it? What's wrong? It's from Kyle. He says, "I'm sorry." My God. Is he not coming? I knew it. I knew the minute we moved down here, people would start to abandon us, it's just... No, it's worse. Daisy's coming. And I'd get home and there'd be bite marks all on the inside of my mouth. So if you're wondering why I never let you go down on me when we were together, that's the reason. - I wasn't, but thank you. - Just giving you some advice, you don't have to take it. - We were 16. - And? - I've gotten better. - Says who? - I do. - Anyway, all I was saying is that it's been a long time. We've all changed, and if Jack... Oh, God give it up. - What? - The Jiz. - Jiz? - Jackson and Liz. Yeah, we only ever hear from them when they're down and out and they need a home crowd boost. They seem really happy here. My best guess is that they've blown what little money they had left on their latest #Blessed tour. Or they read an article, that says that hobby plants are the sexy new status symbol of the eco-friendly millennium and they're looking for applause to justify their purchase. You know, this is maybe why they didn't invite you. - Are we're nearly there? - We're about to hit town. You're gonna get to see where I grew up. I really need to pee, do they have toilets there? - Some of the buildings do, yeah. - I'm not stopping. - Oh, take him to the pub. - Oh, fuck no. Come on, I really wanna see it. - Is it even open? - Uh, 3:00 pm on a Saturday, it's gonna be the only thing open. - We're really late. - To a party you're crashing. Don't pretend like you have manners all of a sudden. Oh my God, it is the saddest little place, you gonna love it. Be quick. - You're not coming? - Fuck no. Come on. You were right about this place. Oh, look at that carpet. Ah, we just need to use the bathroom. It's all right. I used to live here. Come on. Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move. - Is that blood? - Welcome to Wellworth. Wh-why did you bring me here? Just go quickly, we need to get out of here. - This was a mistake. - Okay. But just... just... - can you wait outside? - Sure. Daisy? - No. - Yeah, little Daisy Blakely. - No. - Yeah, yeah, - Ronnie's girl. - You're mistaken. You're all grown up. Uh, what brings you back here? Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your dad. I wasn't. We... we all miss him here. Come on. - Let go of my arm. - Come on. Come on. - Let go of my arm. - Darryl. - Is he bothering you? - Yes. Just trying to be friendly. Darryl, get inside. Come on, I'm done with this place. Yeah, me too. Did he say why she's coming? Uh, I asked him but he hasn't replied. Reception is cutting in and out. It's really bad today. When did you even see her last? Do you remember last year when we had our going away dinner before we went to Mombasa? No, I don't think you invited me to that. Well, you're lucky. Daisy got hammered. Surprise, surprise. And made an absolute fool of herself. She had the nerve to tell Liz she's wasting her life with me. - Huh. - I think the orphans of Mombasa would disagree. We haven't spoken since. You know, I never really understood why you guys were such good friends. She was always such a weirdo at school. Anyway, um, do you guys want to see my photos from my trip to Bali? Jackson, Brett's here. What? You didn't tell me Brett was coming. How do I look? - Hey, mate. - Hey. Good to see you. How's it going? - Everything good. - Hi, Brett. Mara. What's... what's happening? Well, I was just telling these guys about my trip to Bali. We were just having a chat about Daisy. Daisy. Daisy Blakely, do you remember her? From high school? Liz's friend. Oh! Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah redhead, kind of hot? If you like crazy. I kind of do. Is she coming tonight? Apparently, sorry. She wasn't invited. Ah... We all hate her. Well, I don't hate her, I just... And she's coming anyway? Hm, brave. She's an alcoholic. Speaking of, I got the esky in the back of the car, you wanna come give me a hand? - Sure. - I'll help. Okay. Here we go. - Hey, mate. - Hey, Kyle. - Good to see you. - So good to see you. G'day, mate. Let me get some drinks out of the car. - I'll help you, Brett. - Hi, guys. We made it,. It's so good to see you. And Daisy, what a surprise. Yeah, Kyle said I could tag along. - Did he? - Do you want me to show you where you can put that, Kyle? Uh, yep. Sure. We'll be back in a second. Hi, Daisy. Hi. Oh, I'm Jon. What are you trying to do to me? I can explain. Make it quick because I got a whole farm out there to hide your corpse on. We got you this. Oh, thank you. There's an elephant on the label. So there is. Look I needed a lift from town all right, so I gave her a call. Oh, my God, Kyle, get your license. Well, you didn't tell me that she wasn't invited. Okay, so maybe you can spare a thought for how awkward a situation this is for me. Does she hate me? Daisy? She hates everything. Nice place you got here. Thank you, Daisy. - Hey, there. - Hi. Daisy, do you remember Brett? I don't know. Come closer. He was a couple of years above us at school. Shh, Mara. I was talking. Yes, of course I remember you. How are you? - Pretty good. - Hold that thought. Badada. Hi, I'm Jon. I promise I won't let her make a scene. Maybe with a bit of luck she'll be passed out before dinner time. Oh, my God. She's gonna drink, isn't she? Don't freak out. She ruined our last dinner party. I don't want her ruining this one as well. Hey. Hi! Me first. Hi! This is such a surprise. I hope it's not an inconvenience? No, not at all. The more the merrier. I'm sorry I didn't invite you. Oh, no, don't even worry about it. Uh, it's just I know you don't like coming up here. Oh, it's fine. That's fine. And it's been a while. Yeah. Aw, yay! - I need a drink. - Me too. But first, we planned a tour of the property. The property! Uh-huh, yeah. Let me take this. So Jon, Kyle hasn't told us much about you. Kyle doesn't know that much about me. How long have you guys been, uh, seeing each other? Say that, seeing each other. Since, uh... midnight. I guess this is technically still our first date. Hey, luggage-free and ready for love. Did you give him our wine? Yep. Jon picked it out. He likes the elephant. We heard. So is this everybody? No more surprise visitors? Well, thank you everybody for joining us on our little estate for an evening of new beginnings with old friends. We are so lucky. Yes, Liz and I are so lucky. We've been on so many wonderful adventures in the past few years and we've seen a lot of amazing things. But it was always our intention to come back to Wellworth - and make our home here. - Always our intention. And what better a house warming gift than to have all our dear, dear friends who've stuck by us throughout the years, back in the place where we all grew up. Oh, well I... I didn't grow up here. Ah, uh... I bet you're probably all dying to see what else our little slice of paradise has to offer. So... This... is our lake. It's great for swimming or just relaxing. Or for looking at. And this is our view. This is where you need a come if you want good reception. Or sometimes you can get a fine signal down by the lake. If that's important to anyone later on. Smile guys. These are our cows. Is this a dairy farm? I don't actually know. They were here when we arrived. I don't like cows. No, don't touch the fences. They're electrified. Of course, this is our humble abode. We know it's not fancy, but... we don't need fancy. We've got each other. And thus the tour concludes. Right on schedule. Now, we thought you guys might enjoy a little sunset wine and cheese party before dinner. So Jackson and Brett you could grab the cheese plates - and Mara if you could... - I've got the wine. Oh, actually it's right here. That is the starter wine. I am looking for the good stuff. Daisy, I have it. Now we are talking. Ah, we were actually saving that. For a special occasion. Well you said so yourself, Jackson, what could be more special than having all of our dear, dear and friends who've stuck by us through all these years back here in the place where we all grew up. I am so done with Daisy. What is her problem? I don't know. She's all over Brett. It's disgusting and he's being nice, but I can tell he's not, like... into her. He can't be, right? So yours is the next farm over? Yeah. - And it's a proper farm? - Mm-hm. This is a proper farm. You don't know what the cows do, Jackson. - Do you want some? - Steady that. No, I'm okay. I'm gonna just grab a beer. - You want one? - I'll come with you. - Turn it down. - What? You know what. Mara's already really upset. I know. It's hilarious! She really likes Brett and they aren't very many guys for her to choose from out here. I hear that. He's pretty much my only chance at a good time tonight. He's kinda cute. I mean, he's all right. If you knew you were gonna have such a bad time, why did you agree to come, Daisy? Like, who does she think she is? You should just tell her to go because I don't think she's going to take the hint. She's clearly jealous of you and Jackson. You know, I heard she didn't even come back into town for her own dad's funeral, and then she what? Shows up the second you don't invite her to a dinner party. So petty. Mara, I've still got a lot to do. You know what pisses me off, Kyle, I get drunk at one of their parties once and she tries to cut me out of their life. Please be civil. Jackson's parent's pitched in for this place. Either that or they dipped into Liz's orphan bonus. Orphan bonus? Liz's parents are dead. Happened when she was little, so it's all right. Well, I guess that's why she places so much emphasis on external validation to achieve personal happiness, yeah? Don't you, like, worry, okay? I-I still think you're doing an amazing job and dinner is going to be... oh, my God. Ow, ow. Just wait there, - I will get you a band aid. - No! Just... I've got this. You go, enjoy the party, have a drink. Go, go. Okay. But it's really an unsustainable way of life. I mean, even just the slightest hiccup could send her into a devastating emotional tailspin where one event will compound on top of another and she'll either end up having to completely change her way of thinking or it'll destroy her. Hi, guys. Daisy. Oh, hi, Mara. - How are you? - So tired. You know, I just got back from Bali. I'm gonna go find Brett. Hey. Hi. I thought maybe we should talk. Not now. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for rocking up like this. - It's fine. - No, it was a dick move. Just don't worry about it. I just didn't know we were there. What? I knew things were bad between us, and we haven't exactly spoken in a while, but... - I didn't know it was over. - Nothing's over, okay? I just told you, it-it's fine. Can we be honest with each other for one minute? Daisy, I don't have time for this. I'm worried about you, Liz. You're worried about me? That's sweet, but don't be. - I'm... fine. - Fine. Yeah. All right. Got you. Like, thi-this isn't you. - What? - This whole Stepford farmer wants a wife thing you've got going on. Daisy... it's nice that you suddenly want to look out for me. I've always looked out for you. Maybe you should try doing a little bit of practice on yourself first. I can handle myself. Oh... Time for dinner. Phones in here, everybody. Let's unplug for a little bit. Unplug from what? There's no reception. Um, that's my place card. Here you go. Jackson, do you want to say anything? What? No, no. I'll say something. I just wanna say how nice it is to reconnect with you all. It gets lonely out here, so, uh... thank you, Jackson, for coming home to keep me company. And thank you, Liz, for being, as always... a perfect host. All right. Everybody, dig in. Whoa, Liz, this is delicious. You haven't eaten anything yet. Well, it looks better than the airline food I had this morning flying home from Bali. Are these, uh, homegrown veggies, Liz? No, not yet. One day, we hope to be entirely self-sufficient here, but it's early days yet, right Jackson? Uh, yes, early days. I still can't believe you guys own this entire property. It's... so grown up. Well, people talk about, uh, how difficult it is to break into the property market, but, really, if you're just prepared to live a little bit out of the city... How much did your parents chip in, Jackson? - Hmm? - Your parents, did they help? A little. Uh-huh. It was less of a loan and more of an advance, right? Yes. Jackson's gonna be doing some work with the family business. Oh, you're going into pesticides. Yeah, that's fitting. I'll be on the admin side. Well, what would the orphans do without you? And the travel blog. They're on hold for a little bit. Don't worry, it's all part of our plan. Your plan. Our 10-year plan. When I was planning my trip to Bali, - I decided to... - Oh, my God, - you went to Bali? - Yes. Do you wanna tell us about it? Well, it's not that interesting. Okay. How about you, Brett? Been anywhere interesting lately? - I've never been to Bali. - That's okay, it's shit. Well, we didn't go to any of the touristy places, - we went to, like, the real... - Truth be told, I don't get away that much at all, actually. Although, I camped out in my back paddock last night. - That sounds nice. - Yeah. The weather was beautiful. I didn't even bother to pitch a tent, I just slept underneath the night sky. There were so many shooting stars, it was like the universe was... waving hello. Yeah, we stayed at this resort that had all these, like, stars by having... Are you... are you all right, Jackson? You're crying. - It must be the... - The onions. The on... the onions, yeah. Did I not cook them enough? Or something in the air, allergies. Allergies? Good gravy. This gravy is good. Thank you, Jon. So how did you and Kyle meet? - There must be a story there. - Oh... Yeah. It's a good one, um... Grindr. But he had a really good opening line. Pass the peas. I remember when Kyle first brought one of his boyfriends to dinner. Or we could, uh, not tell this story, Jackson. He expected us to be shocked. Was that the dental nurse? Gary. - Gary, the dental nurse. - I liked him. - Me too. - It's a shame he was married. But I did not expect you to be shocked. - I was just a little bit... - Daisy was shocked. - No, I wasn't. - Of course, you were. Daisy and Kyle used to go out in high school. - Briefly. - We used to think it was so funny watching them go around town together, and also, like, a little bit sad that she didn't know. I knew. Remember the social when they came together, - and they... - I knew. I only dated him because it was the only way to stop you and your friends from trying to bash him, Jackson. That's not true. We played around. We had fun, right, Kyle? - Yeah. - We were friends. - Yeah. - It's not the way - I remember it. - I'm surprised you can remember much at all from those days. You know what I do remember? How desperate we all were to get out of this place. Maybe you were. And how much shit we use to talk about Mara for coming back here. - Wait, what? - Do you remember that, Liz? - Don't listen to her, Mara. - Because I do. It's easy to talk shit, Daisy. Amen to that. You, of all people, should know that sometimes you can see things and make assumptions, and you don't know the full story. Just bringing up the elephant in the room. That's a good idea. - Uh, hey, more wine, anyone? - Yes, please. I think some of us have had enough. - Oh. - Not you, Mara. As I said, I can handle myself, Liz. I like a girl that can drink me under the table. Funny, that's exactly where I want you. Well, I don't want everybody getting too merry. Merry. I've got a real treat planned for dessert. I'll give you a hint. It's a little bit interactive. Oh, that sounds fun. Liz makes some mean dessert. It's a hobby of mine. Aren't so glad you finished that communications degree? All right, that's enough. Hey! For fuck's sake, Daisy. Those are my good glasses. It was an accident. Nobody move. That's just glass, Liz. It's hand-blown, lead-free, crystal glass with a laser-cut grip. Sorry. Why are you like this? Daisy, don't you dare. Oops. It's just glass, Liz. Glass breaks. It's life. You're embarrassing yourself. Yeah. Well, apparently I have a reputation to uphold. Liz. Perhaps we should go outside and get some fresh air. Daisy? Great idea. I like, uh, can I come too, Brett? No, Mara. Please stay put. Hey, wait up. Fuck. Fuck, I can't believe I did that. Give it a bit. Liz will calm down. No, I forgot the wine. I've got something better. Oh, yes. What, you think I'd head to a Liz and Jackson dinner party without a little insurance policy? You got any more of this? Back at my place. How far? About a half hour walk. I'm game. I always figure how dark it gets out here. Yeah, I love it. I hate it. I got that. So why did you come back? I don't know. I was angry... at Liz. What? Cause she didn't invite you? Because she didn't do what she was meant to do. Liz and I had a deal. All the things that we were going to do, when we finally got out of Wellworth. She got away from her aunt and I got away from my dad. I'm a fuck-up, always been a fuck up. Liz is smart. She should have done something. What? I don't know. Something. That's why I like it out here. It's nice and quiet. It's no pressure. Nobody tells me what to do, so I do what I want. But I checked the Defense website and the fire ban doesn't extend to inside the house. So I thought we could each take a turn with the torch, caramelize the tops of our own Crème Brûlées. What a fun idea! Where's my phone? Daisy, what is it now? We need to call the police. Fuck. Whoa, what's going on? There's something wrong with Brett. What? Is he hurt? He attacked me. - Oh my God. - Slow down. - Close the door. - Okay, okay. - Daisy? - Don't touch me. Well, te-tell us what happened. I don't know. All right? We... were walking and then he tried to kiss me. Lies. And something came out of his mouth. I don't know what it was. Daisy, where is Brett now? He didn't want to stay. - He's bleeding. - It was a stick. Daisy, I'm sorry. Guys, come on. - Let me in. - Don't let him in. Daisy, look, I'm sure this is all - just a big misunderstanding. - She's drunk. - Not helping, Mara. - Guys, I'm sorry. Open the door. Wait, wait, don't let him in. Liz, he's hurt. Come on, you know Brett wouldn't do something like this. What the fuck's happened to me? - He's a good man. - Welcome back. - Daisy, what did I do? - Stay away from me. - I'm staying right here. - I'm so confused. So am I. One minute we're walking and talking, the next she's coming at me with a log. That's not what happened. Crazy Daisy. Let's all just... He came at me, Liz. Calm down for a moment, okay? Someone needs to take a look at Brett's head. I'm a doctor. - What? - Let me take a look. Did you know this? I did not. Liz, I'm telling you the truth. All right? You have to believe me. - Got any gauze? - I'll get the first aid kit. Liz, we have to call the police. Let's not do anything rash, all right? We... we have all been drinking. Oh, we're all emotional. Don't give me that bullshit. I know what I saw. What did you see? Things inside of him, that he wanted to put inside of me. Ugh. I'll get some water. Fuck this. I'm getting out of here. - Oh my God. - Where... where are my keys? Daisy, you are in no state to drive. I want my keys and I want to leave, Liz. Can someone get Mara to the bathroom, please? So sorry. I'm sorry. No. I'm... I'm sorry. Look, I should go. No, no. Please settle down now. This might sting a little bit. - Ah. - I haven't done it yet, ya baby. - Where the fuck are my keys? - You're not driving. - Everybody, please stop yelling. - There we are. All cleaned up. You're not driving either, Brett. It's fine. I'll just sleep in the car. No, no. You shouldn't go to sleep right away. At the moment, I think it's better if I'm just not here. I'm sorry. All right. Daisy, if I... if I hurt your feelings or gave you the wrong impression. It's been great catching up, everybody. I hope we can do it again soon. Brett. Well, thank you for a delightful evening, Daisy. - Jackson... - You really are - the life of the party. - Don't. No, Liz. Someone has to say something and if you're not gonna do it, I will. There's something seriously wrong going on here. Daisy, the only thing that's wrong here is you. It's gone far enough. You show up here, uninvited on a mission to make everyone as miserable as you are. Well, I'm not going to stand for it, not in my house! Get out! Take a chill pill. I'm sorry. I may have had too much to drink. Oh, Daisy. It's okay. We'll probably all laugh about this in the morning. I'll get some more water. I don't want to fight anymore. You had a long drive. - You're probably tired. - And stressed. Yeah, you're... you're stressed. I don't think it's us you need to apologize to. I think you need to go out there and apologize to Brett. She can do that in the morning. No, no, no. It's fine. Look at his eyes. Um, Jackson, I feel really bad. Would you mind getting Brett for me? Sure. Oh, did you see that? See what? His eyes. Did you see his eyes? What are you talking about? It's the same as when he came at me before. - Are you on something? - He wasn't blinking. - Daisy. - Neither was Brett. - That's ridiculous. - No, no, no. I saw it too. - Jon. - I know what I'm talking about here, Kyle. I did my dissertation on blinking in the brain. - Oh, dear God. - The average human being blinks approximately 15 times per minute. Who are you? So you're saying there's something wrong - with Jackson now? - I don't know. Have you noticed anything? What do you mean? Anything out of the ordinary? No. Liz, if you're just trying to fuck with me, if this is some sort of practical joke or revenge, then, fuck you. But if not, we need to take this really, really seriously. I'm not... nobody is trying to... fuck with you, Daisy. All I'm trying to do is have a nice dinner with my closest friends and... things are getting out of hand. I need to sit down. Liz, if there's nothing going on, where is the cable? This is one big cluster-fuck. Am I using that right? Cluster-fuck? Try to stay positive. Again with time, we can fix this. - Oh, sorry. - Pay attention. No. It's Jackson, he's kicking up again. You gotta be firm with him. Remind him who's in control. Remember your training. If I let him kiss me, it would be inside me. This is insane. Let's just watch them when they come back in, okay? Whoa, we're back. Everyone, let's forget the craziness. Daisy? - Liz. - Liz. - Daisy. - Brett. Jackson said something about an apology. - No, I never said that. - You did too. - You're mistaken. - Do you see it? - Yeah. - See what? Are you sure you're not drunk, Jackson? Maybe you're a little bit stressed. I'm drunk? Wow, the famous Daisy. Everybody be quiet! This is not at all how I planned for this evening to go. Liz. I would absolutely love it if everybody would just... sit the fuck down. Now! I'll, um, I'll just get Mara? Leave her. Now, I've seen and heard some things tonight that, I'll be honest, I don't quite understand. But I think we all just need to take a moment, reset, re-center and get things back on track and we'll all feel better. And now I'm going to go and get dessert. I said, I'm going to go and get dessert. I'll help. Thank you, Mara, but I can do it myself. You can, but you don't have to. - What? - Ah, blessed, guys. This is a surprise, I know. Ten years together, I bet you thought this day would never come. Liz, your patience is a quality I admire so much. And you're always putting the needs of others before your own. But today is all about you and how much I love you. Elizabeth Elroy, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife? Yes... yes. Oh, my God. Yes. Oh. Ah, Jackson. What is going on? I need a... I need a band-aid. So I went into the bedroom and outside, I saw Brett and Jackson kissing. I think that's how they transfer it from person to person. Transfer what exactly from person to person? I don't know, but we'll probably get some answers when Jackson wakes up. Do you think he's okay? I mean, he's been out for a while. I think his lack of consciousness might be one of his lesser issues right now. Can you guys speak up? Shh. I think he's waking up. Jack... Jackson. Jackson, can you hear me? What happened? You were unconscious. Liz punched you in the face. - I'm sorry. - Don't apologize to him. - Unconscious? - What is going on? Don't worry about it, Mara, just keep an eye out for Brett. I wanna be included. He seems pretty out of it. You hit him pretty hard. Jackson... Jackson, listen to me. Okay, we want to help you. We want to get you to the hospital, but first you need to tell us where the keys are. - The keys? - The car keys. Oh, you'll never find them. Please don't! - What's going on? - My good glasses. Answer me. Or what? Oh, you really want to find out? I could get you a knife. Violets, violets, that's your first response to everything. My name is Daisy. I think he means violence. Yes. Sorry, I'm still getting a handle on your language. Let me rephrase. Nobody needs to get hurt. That's not what we're about. - Who's we? - No sign of Brett yet. Thank you, Mara. Who's we? He means the things inside of him. Well, obviously. There's more than one of us in here. There's one for you and you, and you, and you, even you, Mara. - Me? - Get back to the window, Mara. So no one needs to fight, really. - Where's Jackson? - He is in here too. My God. Jackson. Jackson, can you hear me? - Get back, Liz. - He can. I want to speak to him. Well, I would let him out, but first, he needs to be more complacent, compliant? I think both work. Huh. You got that, Jackson? Pipe down. It is such a chore pretending to be him. I'm so glad I don't have to do it anymore. Just please, don't hurt him. Well, that's not my intention. But I'm not the one holding a... thing. - It's a glass. - Stop helping him. Don't think I might use this if I have to. It wouldn't help the situation. You'd only be hurting Jackson, you wouldn't be hurting me. What do you want? I want the floor for just a second to give a little speech. Something they teach us in training for this very circumstance. So... We come in peace. No, not doing this. Huddle. This is bad. What do... do you think that he was telling the truth? Well, you saw what came out of his mouth. I don't know what to think, but I just know we can't hang around here any longer. If we can get to the top of the hill, - maybe we can call for help. - No, because Brett is still on the loose out there. We have no idea how many of those things are running around. - What are they? - Some kind of parasite, one that can override the neurological - function of the human host. - How do we defeat it? I don't know, I'm a GP. Maybe if we can get to town. Yes, do it. Go into town. - Don't listen to him. - They could have gone to town. That's what he wants us to think. For all we know, we could be the last people in the country. He's trying to make us paranoid. If I wanted to make you paranoid, I'd just point out the fact that we've already gotten to one of you. Oh, this is exciting. He's lying. I'm not. What do you mean you've already gotten to one of us? He means one of us is infected. Oh, my God, is it me? I don't know, is it? We have no way of knowing. No, we can figure this out. Who has been alone with Jackson or Brett today? She's been alone with Jackson. That was before he kissed Brett. Daisy was alone with Brett. And then I come straight back here to explain to everyone what was going on. Which could have been some kind of trick. Ah, I like laughing. If these things are in town, then any one of you guys could have been infected before you got here. - You went to the pub. - With Kyle. But Jon made me wait outside the bathroom while he peed. I get stage fright. So what did you do while he was in there? Tried not to make eye contact with the patrons. Guys, this isn't getting us anywhere. Hang on, I've got an idea. Hello. Hi, Dawn, It's working. We're phoning. You guys almost done out there? You're missing the party. Uh, we've hit a little snag. Snag? Brett, how many are left? - Four. - Brett, you're cutting it very fine. - I know. - Look, the others will be here in the morning. By dawn. Wait, dawn? Dawn? I only just got that. Like what, Dawn? On dawn? It's... weird, huh? Yeah... Anyway, I don't want to have to explain to Control that you've stuffed up the mission just because you can't make out with a bunch of people at a party. She... you won't have to. Alright? It's... it's just one of them that's giving me a bit of trouble. She doesn't want to go quietly. Oh. Feel ya. Dawn has been screaming all day. She's terrified. We'll get them on board. You better. There's a lot of us counting on this being our forever. I know. Get it done. Okay. Uh... Come on, Daisy, we're up. What are we doing, Liz? You're kidding me. Come... come on. I mean, have you got a better idea? This is the only thing that we know that might draw them out. Fuck it. - Clean. - Clean. Who's next? - I'll go. - Mara, you don't actually have to. No. You can't say no. He can't say no, can he? She's all gross and vomity. Can't I just kiss my boyfriend? - Uh. - What's that face? Boyfriend. I just... I don't think that we're there yet. Uh. Ah well... I mean, this is technically still our first date so, uh. Well, somebody has to kiss me. Fuck. Ah! You piece of shit! No way. Sorry, buddy. You almost made it, too. He didn't know it was supposed to happen. He didn't know any of the training scenarios. So much death. I killed Mara. What? Why? It was an accident. I... I was trying to catch her and she... she broke her head on a rock, it popped open like a watermelon. Good. We're not supposed to kill them. Why not? They didn't seem to have a problem killing us. With a more relaxed attitude to murder, we might have found our forever planet six attempted invasions ago. We can't dwell on the past, we have to focus on the mission at hand. - Where are the others? - In there. Come on guys, no point trying to hide. - How much do they know? - Enough. They didn't let me do the speech. We... we mean you no harm. - They don't believe that. - They shouldn't. We don't have time. Should we break it down? Ah, Jackson doesn't like that idea. Huh, he's still giving you trouble? Man, he won't shut up. I miss being in Brett. Dawn's having the same problems in town. Inspector Dawn? What'd she say? Is she, uh... what's the... - Pissed? - Yeah. She says, we have until s... the sun comes up. If there's anyone left, then they call off phase two. If we can't even square away one small town, how are we meant to take over an entire planet? This isn't our fault, all right? They lied to us. They said that this wouldn't be like the last time. But they said that when we went into this this would be a walk in the park. Well, I haven't even had time to bloody try a walk in the park, have I? I've been too busy running around this stupid farm trying to get someone to kiss me. Blame is the enemy of positive change. Ah. Says the dingus who forgot that he was supposed to blink. Huh? Huh? Huh? Well... If the humans wanna get vicious, I say we get vicious. Probably shouldn't. You know what tends to happen when we force ourselves on another species? Yeah. Well, you know what's gonna happen if there are any humans left at dawn. No. They aren't anymore humans left in Dawn. Dawn, not... not Dawn's. Now, I say we break down this door. Shut up, Jackson. Wait. Wasn't there another door to this room? Oh, is that what you were trying to say? Come here. Ah, I hate breathing. God. - Ah, I just got it. - What the... Uh, damn it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, God, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! We... we just killed Kyle. It wasn't Kyle. No, but he was in there. He... he felt that. Oh, my God. Come on. We just killed Kyle and he couldn't do anything to stop it. Liz, it's going to be us unless we get out of here. Come on. You heard what they said back there, there's going to be more of them at dawn, and if we're still here by then... No! Daisy. No. Daisy. Daisy! Daisy. - Daisy. - You need to go. Go. I'm not leaving you. You have... you have to. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me. That's not true. You didn't invite me. This one's on me. I can't do this alone. Daisy. Daisy. Jonny boy! where you hiding, you can't hide from us. Jon! What are you running from? Jon. Wait, don't run, I can see you. Jon? Where are you? Don't hide. Stop that. Move. Let me talk to Jackson. You're in no position to be asking me for things. If he's in there, I want to talk to him. Well, he can hear you. He's telling you to be a good girl and come quietly. It'll all be over soon. - Where's Kyle? - They killed him. - What? - No. How could you? You wanna be next? Look, this will go a lot easier for both of you if you just cooperate. Things can get quite messy if you don't. This is why we prefer to catch people by surprise, it's a lot faster and simpler that way. I will fight you with every fiber of my being. Mate, seriously, you don't want to do that. Just let us go. You know we can't do that. I honestly don't understand the resistance here. I mean, we're offering you a pretty sweet deal. What are you doing with the? We're running out of time. The others will be here soon. It's fine, we've got everything under control. I don't want to be the one responsible for letting the team down. The others have done their job, they're already in town partying. Comparisons aren't helpful. Let's just get the job done at our own pace. No, you are right. Jon! Come on! Come on,. That's the pain. Just let it happen. Jon! This one's got spirit. Fight it, Jon! Careful what you wish for. Calm down, you got this. Fight it Jon, fight it. Oh yes. Get him, little dude. Take control. Come on, little guy. Uh. Oh no. Jon. Jon. Well, that was traumatic. Ugh, what a waste. Well Liz, are you gonna be a good little girl? Hey! Oh, whoa. Where are you going? I can't feel this, but Jackson can. - His screaming is... - Stop it. He's crying out for you to help him. Okay, okay. Only can you just stop hurting him. Okay, wait, wait. Wait, just give me a moment. We don't have a moment. No, I... I... I... I understand. I just want to know what I'm in for. What we in to. Um, I'm scared. There's no need to be scared. That's what we've been trying to tell you. We know just how you feel. We've alone in the dark as well, for ages. A long, long time. Looking for a planet to call our own. We want to take care of you. And I'll get to be with Jackson? He wants you to do this. What's he saying right now? Right now he's pretty pissed about the hand thing. But essentially, we're on the same page when it comes to you. You're our superwoman, you're perfect. You're everything a husband and an invading species could ask for. Even Brett agrees. Okay, then. Okay, okay. What... Ah! Not this again! I'll stay here. You go around the other side. This is really not cool, Liz. They warned us about emotional manipulation. You're surrounded. You've got nowhere to go. Go away. Um, no. - Go in after her. - You do it. I have a better idea. No! He was my friend. This is why we wait for the kiss. Hey! Sorry, Jackson. How does she keep finding these weapons? Are you okay? I can't move my legs. You don't need legs. Hey, Liz. I don't wanna have to kill you, Liz, but you're making this very difficult. That was a bad move. Get up. Oh! There. They are... They're coming. They coming. Kiss this. I disconnected the starter motor.
