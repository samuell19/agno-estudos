Put it in the fridge - But she could open it Put it over there Is there any smoked beef? I ate that this afternoon, I was hungry There's some salad after the soup I bought a kilo of apples, you like them don't you? And I paid with my own money. Who'll bring Lucia some soup? Off you go. Do you have the grocery list? It's getting more expensive every time You are making a mess Come on, eat. If you didn't need all that medicine, we could buy more steaks But you don't care. Soup and lobster is all the same to you What did you just hide? Nothing, just sugar Go to sleep. Don't you have any money? Only 10 Francs left This can't go on I'll seduce my boss This'll keep you company Coffee? Giulia, 2 coffees, please What did the lawyer say? - He's pessimistic Isn't there anything we can do while Lucia is still underage? No, you'll have to go to court to have her declared insane But that's expensive. I'm afraid so Your husband's will complicates things Beatrix, why are you so desperate to keep this villa? It's very expensive Sell it before it gets out of hand You know I can help you Abandon it? After all the sacrifices I've made? I won't There'd be no problems without Lucia What are you saying? - I mean if she was normal God only knows what I've done for that child I'll do anything for her, I have to win the trial Absolutely. Do we bring her downstairs? Outside, so she can freshen up Come on Over there so they can't see her Enjoy and take some deep breaths, it's free Hello Snow white, smile - Recognise me? What time is it? 20 to - We're leaving Come on, it's late What's your niece suffering from anyway? I've told you twenty times already. A childhood trauma made her this way Long ago? Yes, she was ten Giulia and I were still in school Will she recover? - Who knows We've tried everything and keep buying expensive medicine The doctor says a shock could cure her I'll give her a shock She'll be in heat fast enough You're disgusting, we're leaving You're lucky, we're working to support you and you're having fun Aren't you having fun? Too bad. Here look, a man and a woman Look, a handsome nigger and a blonde And we're searching for an even prettier one Madame butterfly with two Chinese fellows Not bad, those two girls.

No I work here but only in the afternoon I'm off duty in the mornings Are you a student? - Yes, psychology I'm Andre. - Giulia, pleased to meet you Well now that we are neighbours, shall we meet sometime? Of course, why don't you come visit me in my room There's a door in the fence, call if it's locked And what if it's locked? - Well you go to my room I'll show you Great albums. You got this one too? It's rare It's a bit heavy Whiskey or Martini? At 10am? A bit early. What are we going to do? Let play . Stop sulking Are you acting like that little boy? You should have seen him looking at my legs He'll be thinking of them all night And you should not think about that nigger and Butterfly Let's get some rest She keeps getting heavier - Has she eaten? No, but I left you something in the oven It's late I'm going to miss my train See you tonight Giulia is off to fuck strangers so we can feed you Giulia, don't forget to visit Didier for the stuff May I? Feet first, then your food Come on eat Did he give it to you? - Much to his annoyance The swine, can you imagine? We've been his customers for almost ten years now I put some green stuff in it 280 recipes for lovemaking What if your mother sees us? Are you mad? - Whiskey is too expensive for her What's on TV? We shall have to ask the court for a copy Wait. He's just terrible Not in front of the children. Disgusting, these old people Excuse me, what are you doing here? I wanted to talk to you About what? I wanted to ask you a favour - What, then? I'll escort you to your car Giulia's birthday is Saturday - Yes, I know We want to have a party, but not for grown-ups My aunt would ruin everything with her sad face It would be very sweet of you to go on a date with her Why not? Listen, if you'd really want to surprise my aunt... visit for two days A weekend - Next Saturday Sounds do-able. I hope I can convince her I bet you can You are a sweetheart Done deal, I've spoken to grandpa - And? He'll take your mother for two days We'll be completely free We should organise the party Who should we invite besides Bruno? Andre who I've met this morning He lives next door How is he? - Not bad I've had him come up He's not very bright But he won't have to be That tickles No, no not tonight Are you unwell? I'm just not feeling like it Already working? Yes, but thanks for the interruption I was just thinking of you - Same here. What were you thinking? It's my birthday Saturday and I wanted to invite you I'll have to be properly dressed - No, on the contrary I should be undressed? No that's not necessary, there will be no adults How many will there be? I don't know yet, we are with four now. You, me, my cousin Elisa and her boyfriend Ah the gentleman with the big car? - A gentleman? Yeah, I saw them kissing last night Sorry if I have upset you, I was in the garden when I saw them They weren't very discrete Let's talk about something else What should I bring to the party? Nothing, we've got everything But you can bring two or three friends We'll be alone my mother'll be gone Is she the woman in black who leaves early in the morning? Not to be rude, but why does she look so sad? Did something bad happen to your father recently? I trust you, what I'm about to tell you should stay between us I promise Father's been dead for eleven years. Cancer. My mother was expecting a baby The child died when it was two months old Mother was using medicine and the baby was deformed It died two days later Mother has been very sad since that day. It has depressed my mother terribly. Because of her husband, the child, and because she's sterile I'm sorry I asked - It doesn't matter Think of the party I have to go, Elisa is coming Are you insane? What's wrong with you? - Isn't Bruno enough? Now you want Borgo too? - Borgo, me? Yes, you were seen - Who? You were seen kissing him And that wasn't probably all Oh yesterday, well, to be honest, it was a good kiss I'll tell mother, it's disgusting Are you feeling sorry for your mother or are you jealous? Leave me alone Look straight ahead, it's making me nervous First you need to tell me if you are still angry I want to know one thing - What's that? Would she enjoy this just like we do? She prefers to watch Nothing more than a pathetic peeping-tom I'll show you something This is what I wore in St.Tropez, Giovanni's hands were all over me He got angry when I tried to stop him See that, Alex? That was wild. We never stopped. He is dead. His boat has sunk. Besides, who knows how the trial may end It's going to cost me a lot now that Lucia is no longer a minor Who'll bring her food? - Will you go, Elisa? You'll have to be alone to be naughty You eat too much. What's wrong with your car? Something happened when I drove in the garden. Normally its fine but the motor just seized up Will you be staying the night? - You know I can't do that Adele'll do anything, even sue me for adultery I need to be home early Allow me Do you have the time to check a car? I don't know... Tomorrow? Not before 2pm - It needs to be done well Alright see you tomorrow I'm gone for the weekend, would you care to join me? I'd love to but I'll miss Giulia's birthday They won't miss us And you won't miss us. I'll bring you home in Auntie's car after Television No, I'll go Such an attractive couple They haven't in tucked Lucia yet Go to my room, Giorgio Did you eat? I'll undress you You won't be outside today, it's too damp You just watch the trees and listen to the music Louder? Even louder? Guess who? How are you doing? Why's the music so loud? Oh that's probably Lucia's fault It doesn't matter Is that your sister in the chair? Why are you interested? She's pretty, I'd love to meet her Are you serious? You'd be disappointed, she's ill and can't move Doesn't talk, just sleeps and eats And she takes medicine, she costs a fortune Elisa says she's better off dead - Don't talk like that Don't you love her? It's my sister She'll see us - No, she's blind as a bat It would be a shame not to use this opportunity I like you and I want you But not now On the night of my birthday it would be a great present Just wait, baby, I'll give you everything on the night - It'll be great I'll have to wash you because you pissed your trousers Giulia is stupid, I'd leave you here, dirty Elisa is coming, I have to go - When will I see you? Saturday Elisa's boyfriend Bruno will be coming this afternoon to fix Mr Borgo's car So you can get acquainted He's big, but you'll like him What are you doing? - This kicks like a mule. Bruno's here, Are you coming? In a moment Bruno is friendly He came over, so your mother can have an affair Do you like Bruno? He's a great lover If you only knew what he does to me Hard at work? Connections are incorrectly set Help me push Oh my shoulder blade Wait, I'll help you You've got dirty hands Did you invite the Mercelinos too? Yes, but they won't come Invite Nino and his wife then - They won't come Why not? - Because of your aunt That cow brings bad luck She won't be there They don't like the atmosphere. Feels like a funeral. Stop it. Invite them again Why don't you do it? Fuck them, they aren't the only ones Besides, the smaller the group the better Shall we see if the car works at a secluded place? Why not here? In the open air? Seems like fun So, nosey, did you enjoy it? No, it did not have any effect... See what that beast did. I'm good to you, I keep you company.. Be sweet or else I'll put that doll on your lap You see this? If you speak again I'll... Soft skin, like velvet Listen, we should think of something original Yes, but not that stuff It's old-fashioned stuff that makes you look old I want to have a look Aunt Beatrix, I... Where did you get that key? Have you been in the basement? It's dangerous, everything falls down there I've told you a hundred times. Why did you go down there? I wanted old clothes for the party Old dresses, nice hats Those must be in the chest Listen, I forbid you to touch that chest. Those thing belong to my poor Marcello I need these things for the trial Beatrix, calm down. This is for you, for the party Aren't you drinking? There's no love without a moustache, said Victor Hugo Listen, catch that one for me, I want to have her Not that one, the other one It's not funny with the nose Like that? Don't be so timid, switch partners No, are you drunk? You are in great shape Hey show me what you got Show me Get undressed too Don't use that stuff, I'm against it Don't use marijuana It's addictive and makes you selfish Long live alcohol. It packs a punch and feeds revolutionary thought Here, drink some No I've had enough What did you make me drink? Number 15 - No 6 What are you doing with my niece? - With my sister? I want her to have a good time too Good job, Bruno, do it - Looks wonderful With a sick one. I don't want the sick one Is he exhausted? It's me, Giulia. Do you still want me? Nothing That's where they strung up that Negro. The sex between his legs stuck out intensely. Where's his car? - He came without it She saw everything - Yes, of course Bring her upstairs We must get rid of him using mother's car Are you mad? They'll see us - Where? Put him in the chest in the basement We'll put him in there Find something to open it with Don't open it. We don't have a choice. Will there be any papers in it? - I'm sure of it And the cage? - We won't burn. Is the car outside? Did you see anyone? - No, on a Sunday? Don't be afraid, sweetheart They'll never find him again Nobody - What about mother? If she searches for clothes. Say the chest had rotten hay And so we burned it And Lucia? - Poor Lucia I've always said she's better off dead Die. Die, please. Look sweetie, your little brother is dead. You must never forget him Darling, when I think... My life begins as of now
