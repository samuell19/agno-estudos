Here, do it here. Want me to hold your bag for you? Are you kidding? - I won't steal it. - You just look and that's it. Hi, Pascal. Hi, Barbara. How's it going? - Where have you been? I had things to do. I walked here. As usual, right? - You're always busy. - It's a hard life. - You busy too? - Well, yes. How's business? - Not so good! - How come?

Ass I Both asses, forty? - Both asses, forty? - No, thirty and thirty. - My name's lino, what's yours? - Barbara. There's a song called "Barbara™ What do I care? I'm here to work. It was in a musical... What do you wantto do? I'm looking at the little lambs. Forget the lambs, what do you want to do with me? Anything you like, I'm ready! - How much have you got? - Feeluptoit? - How much money have you got? - How much do you want? - Fifty. - Is that all? What's 50,000 lire? Nothing, right? How about it then? I gave a girl 500,000 once, but she was a beautiful young Italian. I'm young too. I'll take the car home and come back later. They all say that. I'll come. I know who you are, so you'd better come! I know who you are, so you'd better come! I'm always around. - I'll expect you! - Your shack's busy now, anyway. - Had too much to drink... - You can't get it up. Let's try without a rubber. Are you kidding? Forget it! - No way! I'm not a kid. - You're right. Don't you know there's that sickness around? We're all sick. I'm not sick. My problem is I'm too macho. Maybe you have pussy on the brain! That too. I'll bring you a present next time. A nice present. And I hope I can get it up. You all promise me a present. Don't worry, you'll get it. This place is a dump! You said you wanted somewhere quiet. So I brought you to our old place. There's a bed, we can do it here. Hold it. - Carmen! - I'm working, remember. Yes, we're on our way. You're wasting my time. I'll call you later, the line's bad. - Be quiet, that was my boss. - Don't waste my time! Alberto! Come here. Where the hell are you? Carmen called. We're wanted at the shop. Let's do this first. I don't feel like it any more. Fuck off! All right. let's go? Give me a hand down. Come over here. Why don't we go in that little hut? I prefer the car. Where are you from, Nigeria? You're Italian? I saw a great boxer once from Nigeria... Dick Tiger! Never heard of him. Saw him in New York. Great boxer, I was a boxer too, as a kid. - Do you like this hat? - Why do you wear it? Are you bald? Yes, a bit, but I wear it because I like it. I gotitin Spain. Have you been to Spain? No, never. It must be a nice place. Like something to drink? Coffee? A glass of wine? A cappuccino maybe. - What a nice little town! - Crowded, though. They're all Japanese. A lot of tourists. They're tourists, right? - You go, I'll stay here. - Why? I can't get out dressed like this, you get it for me. - How's it going? - Okay. You well? Where have you been, all dressed up? - It's Sunday today. - Out to lunch with your friends? So what do we do? The usual? - Let's go. - What about my bike? Leave it there. - What did you say? - Help me, it's safer up there. Leave it where it is. All right, give it to me, we'll take it with us. There's a big job downtown. What do you say? How much do you want? A very big job... I say forty a day each. There's a real big job downtown, pipes, concrete. What are you asking? - Forty! - That's too much! Thirty-eight. Come down a bit, it's worth it. - Thirty-five? - For both of us? - All right. - Better make it thirty-four. - Let's say thirty-three even. - No, not thirty-three. Come on, it's worth it. - You got a work permit? - No. Never mind. We'll settle for thirty-three. Come on then! Any bricklayers? Bricklayer or laborer? I'm a laborer. I'm a laborer too. I want a skilled bricklayer. What's the job? A wall on a site. We can do that. When are you coming for us? Later. - I'll be back. - We'll wait here for you. How much are you paying? Fifty for a laborer, seventy for a bricklayer. That's not much. - How much do you want? - Sixty. Can you paint a room? And fix a roof? What's the pay? - Forty... forty-five. - No, fifty! You got any work for me too? I'll come for thirty. Please, I need the job. I want the work done properly. Are you skilled? Yes, I am. We always work together. I'll be giving him a hand, so I only need one person. The room you have to paint is in an old farmhouse. - How old are you? -71. - Why are you still working then? - lhaveto! I need the money, there's never enough. If I were you, I'd buy a Ferrari and drive through... ...all around Europe! A Ferrari! You couldn't even drive a wheelbarrow. - What do you do? - I'm a publicist. You know what that means? I'm in advertising. Is that all? I also write. - Anything else? - No, nothing else. Who's there? The painter, I'm here to finish the job. I have to finish the job. Well, it's a bit early. What am I supposed to do? - I was asleep... - When can I finish it then? Your mother said by today. Let's see if there's a bar around, I'm parched... It's closed. Now what do we do? A drinking fountain, maybe. I can't see any, though. All right, we'll drink at home. Not again! It won't start. It keeps doing this. It won't start. - Isitan old car? - No. The model's old, but... No, don't touch. It's rather fragile. I said don't touch! I know this car. I want you to do a good job, because the client... - Does he understand? - Not a lot. Translate then. We have to do a good job. It's hard work but well paid. He talks too fast, I can't understand what the job is! He looks kind of weird. I don't think you'll have any problems. I just hope he pays us! It's no good, it won't start. Don't touch, this is no time for playing. I'll try to find a phone. Maybe the parish priest. You wait here. It's no good trying. Priest! Is anybody here? Where are you going? Where's that paint I left here? - You leftit here? - Yes. Was it a big can? - Ask your mother. - Right. I've no idea where it is. See if there's any filler in the car, we'll do the walls. Maybe you have some more paint. Check if we have anything in the car, or we're stuck. Look, I'm going out for a swim in the pool. - These are the reinforcements? - That's right. I picked them myself, they're very good. - But they're youngsters! - Hard workers. - Where are you from? - Albania. - How old are you, boys? - Eighteen. - And your friend? - Same... - How old? - He's eighteen foo. - What are your names? - I'm Ledi. - And you? - Viktori. We have to build a theatre, it's hard work. - Poor young things... - They're good, you'll see. You take charge of them. I expect they're willing. Let's take a look... Quiet now, there's a rehearsal. There! This is my realm! You'd better tell the boys what needs doing. Sanding, painting... and that's not all. Can you do that? When do we have fo finish it by? As soon as possible. It's hard work. If you can doit... One month, do you understand? Can you make it? All of this needs doing. New glass in the windows... A complete renovation. All in one month? There's three of us, we'll have to slog. The men are here fo see about the renovations. It won't take a minute. Those holes want filling, the walls need painting... I want it to look absolutely wonderful! Kid? We have to work. The paint? Go and buy some, then get my mother to pay you back. We'll give it the first coat and see what the color's like. Right, do that. Okay? Get a neutral shade. What's a neutral shade? A light color? A color you like? Neutral, something to match the ceiling and the yellow floor. Nothing too bright or they'll clash. Those boys don't look very strong. Can they manage? Don't ask me, I don't know them. You brought them. - Believe me, they're good. - But they're half-starved! Feed them then. Think this is a soup kitchen? What nonsense! Hey, kid! - Here's the key. - Thanks. All done? - Painted and everything? - I's finished. I hope you like it. If you have any more work, come and get me. Get you where? Leave me your number, I'll call you. I don't have a phone. Come where you found me today. What if you're not there? I can't hang around all day. You tell me when and I'll come. You have to find the work, not me! Yes, but how do I know where to come for you? Where you found me today. - Are you there every day? - Yes, when I'm not working. How can I find you if you're working? You have no phone... - Come a couple of days in advance. - And stand there waiting for you! Pass me the spanner. A number 18! Excuse me... You seem to be very down to earth, so you're useful fo me. I need to make friends with people who do this kind of work. Plumbers, machine operators, butchers... But if I was friends with a butcher... You see, words are for communicating. I'm trying to communicate with you... I don't want to waste your time, but I'd like to discover you! Hand me a screwdriver? Where are you from? Fieri. The city? No, the country, Petova. Are you here on your own? Have you been here long? Only a month. What's your father's name? Suleman. Who do you work for? I work for... And who takes the money for you? My cousin! I'm coming! What a lovely house! Was it hard getting here? Shall we see what needs doing? It's so drafty here, the doors keep slamming. Giacomo, the men are here. Would you come a minute? I'll be right with you, let me just see this. Fifty years ago, Italy was in ruins like Albania. You wouldn't know, of course, but I'm sure Mario can remember. Not really. What do you mean? You were 12 years old! It was a long time ago. Well, you lived in the country. Plenty of food, good wine... oil! In Rome there wasn't a rat or a cat left. All the cats in the Colosseum... - When you live in the city... - It was terrible. I used to pull up buckets of water from the fountain in the square to the fourth floor. That's why my arms are so long. All the water we pulled up! It wasn't even drinkable, but we drank it and cooked with it. These days people drink nothing but mineral water! If I get someone to remove the old floor? You'll find the base ready for you. It won't take so long then. If I have to do it myself, I'll need three days. But if you get it cleaned up, I only have to lay the files. Stand up straight! How much is this going to cost us? Yes, let's have an estimate. About 500,000 lire. No, you didn't go hungry during the war. - ldid! - No salt, no electricity... My mother made home-made pasta every day. Hunger's as ugly as sin! I used to bring meat to Rome. - You had meat too! - We killed off the cows... Exactly! You country people had no idea what it was like... to have no bread, no salt no water, no electricity... We'd barter the meat for salt and bread. You young people could do with a war, it would do you good! Put in 15,000 lire of gas. No, ma'am, you can't. It's a free country, isn'tit? I want 15,000 lire's worth. This is a self-service, ma'am. "Evening. Ten thousand. - Is the cap open? - Yes. Thanks. I thought there were a few girls around here? Yes, but they come late now. They stand over there, right? They've been coming for years. Why aren't they here tonight? They come late. They've got money now and don't need to come early. What are they like? Black? White? All colors. Black, white, yellow... I remember going with a black girl once. But I don't like them much. Nothing personal. I don't like them either. I'm not so good with them. White girls, that's different. I go with them now and then, but it's not the same. I never go with black girls. They don't turn me on. But white girls really get me. I don't know why. I still haven't worked it out. Funny, I'd never have guessed. People think a black man likes black girls, but not me! Well, I go with them sometimes. It depends on how I feel. They used to stand there on the corner, remember? I was passing by and I thought I'd take a look. Done? - What's your name? - Amedeo. But in Egyptian it's Ahmed. Ahmed? You didn't put the gasin! - look, I'm in reserve! - Maybe the gauge is faulty. Take a good look. It's red! Would I steal 10,000 lire after 12 years? You know how many of these pumps are rigged? Mine isn't. You just think everyone's a thief. You're here illegally. So what? That doesn't mean I steal. I gave you 10,000 lire. The gauge should be up to here. It hasn't budged. You only putin 5,000! I'll drive a couple of miles, and if it doesn't go up... I'll be back with the cops! - Ifllgoup! - Think you can rip me off! - If you'll give me the key... - Who are you? I've been working here nearly 12 years. I don't need your help. Do it yourself then, I'm just doing my job. All I've got's a 100,000 lire bill. Sorry, I have no change. Why didn't you come with 10,000? And you say you're so smart you can do it yourself! - Who's this pain in the ass? - Turn off the cell phone! Forget it, I'll walk. I'll change to propane. You can go and get some change. Tell her not to worry, you're with Andrea. Don't worry, I'm with your pal Andrea! Let her talk to Mohammed here! I'll get the Indian to say hello. Hold on... Hello? Good evening, ma'am. You're stone drunk, giving me your phone like that. That was your wife, not mine. - That wasn't my wife! - It was your wife. That was your wife. - Okay, but I'm not drunk! - So why do hand me your phone? After all that I got a work permit and found a job with a big gas station. The company was called ERG. Then I moved on fo... How's life? Nice little boy, how old is he? He's really cute. Sit still! Don't be a nuisance, Lorenzo! She sprinted after the six in the lead... She made a good recovery and won the medal! - A fantastic medal! - And you could see her breasts... - Bouncing up and down... - That's all I looked at! I've had so many worries. First the divorce, then I remarried. Again? Yes, but that didn't work out either. I thought you were sick, not seeing you around. No, I'm fine, it was my wife who was sick. Women are nothing but trouble! It's best not to get involved. I've tried them all... Filipino, African, French... They've been the death of me. - Twenty million lire. - That's a lot of money. If I had that much, I'd buy a gas station! That costs a lot more. If a cab license costs 120 million... a gas station costs a lot more. A gas station's a good deal! But 20 million lire buys you a hair transplant. - So where does that get me? - At least you'll have some hair! Celebrities do it. They put 5000 hairs in here, where you now have 10. Can I pull one out? It didn't come. Let me take a look. - He does have some hair! - Not a lot. 5000 hairs will cover you right across here. I need 200,000 for that! If you win the lottery, you can get some new hair. Hair isn't everything, it's the person that counts. Yes, but if you win the lottery... If you do it to look better... But a lot of hair doesn't make you a better person. I'd spend it on a vacation. Where did you get your license, in Africa? - No, Hamburg. Sorry... - You nearly ran me over! - I didn't mean to... - That's no excuse! You're right, I'm sorry. Can you putin 20,000 lire? - Unleaded or regular? - Regular. Sorry, I can't take that, this is a self-service. - But it's a Deutsche Bank check. - Only 10,000 lire bills. - Do you have 10,000 lire? - Won't he take it? like some? - Why do you smoke those things? - like them. He's pissed off. Told you to get your driving license in Africa! He's African, is he? Sure, you can tell by his skin. - He's not African. - No, he's Swedish! - Where are you from? - Egypt! Egyptians are Africans. Egypt is in Africa! You all asked me to make pasta for you. You kept insisting... You're talking nonsense. Pure bullshit, right? Don't you think so? He's right. I'd rather not interfere between a married couple. - That's not the point! - Silence is golden. - I came out of that... - It's best. Maybe silence should be the starting point. The point of arrival, you mean! That's the problem. How to achieve that... Silence! Unleaded or regular? - I's so hot tonight! - Terrible! Are you staying here? Have a good time! - How are you doing? - Fine, thanks. I worked like a dog today. Cut all the grass... ...me and my wife. It was waist-high! - Is that a mean dog? - No, he's good. I came across a mean dog once... - How old is that dog? - He's three. - He doesn't bite? - No... Some dogs bite, they're dangerous. I'm always scared of dogs. Look, he's playing. He's doing his job, he's a guard dog. I leave him in the car, then I don't have to worry. Could something happen to the car? You never know, they'll steal anything these days. I had a friend called Tazanda. He worked at the kennels. Good man, he was. And another man called Rabiali, he worked at the Kuwait Embassy. Those were my friends in Italy. Whenever I had any problems or difficult moments... I found so many people ready to help me. I found a dentist who helped me. Those people gave me a hand. I'll never forget them. Nobody's here. Is it a self-service? Will 10,000 do? Do you have a 10,000 bill? - Yes. - All I have is a 50,000. - Hope he doesn't steal it! - Unleaded! That's not a very nice thing to say. Please excuse her, she's like that. Geta move on! - let him be... - This waiting's a pain in the ass. - You like him then? He's cute. - Are you joking? He'd be all right for you! Never! An ugly old man like that! Nice teeth though... About time too! Ten thousand, regular. - Hey, how's it going? - Okay. - What's your name? - Amedeo. Amedeo? That's an Italian name! You're not Italian. Where are you from? Have you got another bill? This one's no good. Don't you know how to putitin? I have to do it? That's your job. - How's it going tonight? - Fine. How many did you rip off tonight? I know you guys! You're pretty cool. Isn't it filled yet? You look kinda worn out. Stomach trouble, I was sick for a year. They put a tube into me. Into your stomach? Gastritis? No, my stomach... I guess you smoked too much! I smoked, but it wasn't because of that. Can you spare 2,000 lire? I'm out of gas. - We're flat broke. - Just enough to get me home. - You want some of our gas? - Just 2,000 lire. No, we have to get to Ostia. We can't stretch it. - Can't you give me... - No, we're cleaned out. Give me the keys. Bye! See you! The hell I will! See you, my ass! Some people are such clods... What did you say? I was just talking in general. What's it to you? Keep your hands down. You were talking about me! - Calm down. - Mind your own business! - I was talking to him. - You were talking about me! - lwasnt! You're nuts I - Watch what you say! Keep your hands off me or I'll bust your face! I'll call the police, that's what! - You're a shit! - Apaininthe ass! - I was just talking in general. - He was talking in general. - let's go! - What a night! Nigger! Ignore them, it's not worth looking for trouble. Keep cool, it's always best. When you asked for 2,000 lire, did they stop? They don't stop to help anyone, see? I didn't say anything. Take my advice. When you see kids like that, don't let them stir you up. You never know, they might be popping pills. and chasing them down with beer. It's best to let it ride, they'll go away. I know they take those pills. I don't like your face either. I'd say you take them too. But not everyone's the same, some people are all right. - Are you African? - No, Egyptian. From Cairo, I came here 20 years ago. Those were the days! Gas at 50 lire, cigarettes 300. This was a bad night, but it isn't always like this. It's the same everywhere, there are good and bad people. Listen... Is there really no way to get some gas? No, it's all automatic, only works with bills. You know what you can do? At the second traffic lights there's an Esso station. At the second lights, on the corner. There's a big black man. His name's Francesco, he's Indian. Tell him I sent you. It's not a wild goose chase? He has a scooter, so he can give you the oil. Just add some gas and you'll be okay. Go there and don't worry. He's a friend of mine. Say I sent you. Right, I'd better go. - You're sure he's gotit? - Yes, just go there. I'll stop by now and then. In 1975 I went to Rome. I did a lot of jobs for many different people. Then I became a "legal” immigrant and I worked at a big gas station for a company called ERG. While I was in Rome I met a very nice girl, very brave. Her name is Emanuela. We were together for years and were planning to get married. I returned to Cairo, bought a house, I furnished it and put up some pictures. All mementos of Italy. But I had problems with her family, with her parents and brothers, so I couldnt marry her.
