(gentle techno music) (gentle orchestral music) (dog barking) - [Natalie] Sandy, bring in the presents. - Okay, Mom. That looks great, Mom. Did you get the candles? - 22 and one to grow on. I can't wait for Matt to get here. Why aren't you dressed yet? - I'm gonna take a walk. - Didn't you just do the treadmill? - The doctor told me to exercise. - [Natalie] He also told you not to overdo it. - Yeah, I know. You're putting them too far apart. She won't be able to blow them out. - He means well. - I'm moving out. - Now, stop that. - Ah, come on, Mom, this just isn't working. - You're dad wants you here and so do I. - I'll have enough money as soon as the divorce is final. (gentle orchestral music) (country music) - Ms. Pierce is here. - Oh, I forgot all about her. Can you take her please? - I already offered. She said you're the only one here who can cover her bald spot. - Oh, I'm gonna be late again. My dad's gonna kill me. - Come on, Sarah, you can have her in and out in no time. - [Sandy] Ooh, look, here they are. - Hi. Angel boy. - [Martha] Hi, Mom. - Hi, Roger. - Hi. - [Natalie] Give Grandma a kiss. - I hope we're not late. - You are not late. You're right on the dot. Thank you. - Where's the birthday girl? - You know, Sarah, she lives in her own time zone. - Uh-huh, don't start. She'll be here any minute. - I'm gonna go watch the end of the game, okay? - Okay. - Let's take this off, it's hot. - I will do it. - You'll do it? Okay. How was your last day? - Actually, it was really nice. They offered to double my salary if I'd stay and my new boss called. I'm getting a company car. - Terrific. - Yeah. - Easy, easy. - There he is. Hey. How you doing? - Fine, fine. - Matty. - Guess what? I'm getting a company car and a corner office, what do you think of that? - What do I think? Well, I think it's great. You know what I think. - No, I don't. You never said a word about my new job. - [John] Oh, honey, come on. - Grandma has a surprise for you in the kitchen and Grandma needs you to carve the roast. (traffic whirring) - Amy, don't run off like that. Give me your hand, come on. We gotta get home. We're having a very special dinner tonight. - How come? - To celebrate Aunt Lydia's new job. - Are we having hot dogs? - No. That's your favorite meal. Aunt Lydia likes my stir, remember. And she also likes ice cream. - With chocolate sauce? - Yeah, tons of it. Oh, you're okay. (engine revving) (Amy laughing) What's the matter? - Somebody's calling me. - That's just the wind. - [Danny] Amy. - It makes funny noises sometimes. - No, I heard a man, listen. - God, jeez. You are a crazy fool. - Did I scare you? I didn't mean to. Hey, Danielle, do you think you could talk to your sister for me? See if I can, she won't have nothing to do with me. - You're such a loser, Danny. Lydia finally figured it out. She wants you to stay away. So do I. - Bye, Amy. (women laughing) - [Sarah] Oh, my God, you guys. Thank you so much. You put a lot of thought into this. - Happy birthday. - Don't lose it. - Hey, everybody look over here. Perfect. - [John] Thank you for coming. - Martha, do you have a sitter for Sunday? - Yep, I'm all set. Is Ed watching the motel? - No, he had to go to a funeral. - I'm gonna do it. Oh, give me a break, Martha. I think I can handle it for one night. - Mom, come on. Man of the Year is a big honor. It's an important night for Dad. You can't count on Sarah. - You are something. Sarah wants to go to Dad's party, but she knows we're in a bind, so she offered to watch the motel. She's trying to be more responsible. - She was late for her own birthday party. - She had to work. - Why are you always defending her? - Why are you always attacking her? (Martha scoffs) - Come on, Martha, let's go. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Call me when you get home. (engine revving) (gentle orchestral music) - It was very pretty. Why don't you go get that little candlestick off my bureau. - Hi, Amy. - Hey. - Hi. I quit. - [Danielle] What do you mean you quit? - I mean my boss is kind of a jerk. He like made me work on my lunch hour and everything, so, I quit. - You couldn't just last through one day? - Danielle, please, don't get all peeved out, all right? - It's not that big a deal. I just quit. - It was a good job, Lydia. - Yeah, well, not as good as my new one. - What are you talking about? - Well, today on my way home, I was walking by that new market, you know, and they're like looking for cashiers, so I met up with the manager and he thinks I got a pretty good chance. - Honey, you can't just go jumping around from job to job. - I know, this job pays like 12 bucks an hour. Is that all right? Amy, how are you? - We've got ice cream with chocolate sauce. - We do? - Honey, why don't you go wash your hands. I saw Danny today. He followed me and Amy. He nearly scared us to death. - Yeah, did he say something or what'd he say? - He wants you back. - Ain't happening this time. It's not. I mean, I'm not scared of him anymore, you know. (man banging) - [Man] Anyone in there? Fire, wake up. - Danielle! Danielle! Amy, there's a fire. (sirens blaring) - [Amy] The windows, let's get to the window. (dramatic music) (baby crying) (siren blaring) - Said it was the wiring. It's been shorting out for months. (dramatic music) - [Child] Here, kitty, come on, kitty, kitty. (suspenseful music) (gentle orchestral music) (bell ringing) - Hi. - Good evening. - I'm really sorry to get you out of bed. We just had a fire in our building and the fireman said you might put us up for the night? He says that you sometimes help people out. I'll be honest with you. I don't have any money right now, but I'll pay you back. I promise. - I've got money, Mommy. I can pay. - Well, let's not worry about that now. First let's get everyone to bed. - Thank you so much. I promise I'll pay you back. - It's all right. Right this way. Just follow me back here. I've got an extra room for you. (dog barking) - Hey, good morning. - Good morning. - We go there late last night. And I'm wondering if you could do our room a little later. My little girl and my sister are still asleep. - Oh, sure, that's not a problem. - Thank you very much. - It's all right. (suspenseful music) - Now's the chance, buddy. - Nah, not now, she's got the kid with her. I want her later, alone. - I ain't got nothing but time. (engine revving) (Sarah knocking) - Hi. - Hi. - My mom keeps these around for my nephew. I thought maybe the little girl would like them. - Oh, cool, thanks, come on in. (door closes) - [Lydia] So you cut hair. That's like a tough job. Do you live here like all the time. - I'm trying to save up money. I got into some trouble with credit cards. - Oh, maxed them out, huh? - Good thing for my dad. - [Lydia] He seems real nice, real considerate. - Yeah, he is. He's always doing things for other people, always helping out, even now. - [Lydia] What do you mean? - I mean he had a heart attack. - Wow, sorry. I mean, you'd never know it if you looked at him. - Yeah, it runs in his family. His dad died really young. I think he's afraid the same thing's gonna happen to him. - Dad. I just, um, I wanted to thank you for bailing me out again. - You missed a spot here. - You know, I learned my lesson this time. I did, I'm not gonna screw up again. I promise. - Good. That's good. - Dad, I'm gonna be done here in a second. Do you want to play cards or something? - Maybe later. I gotta take my walk now. - I love you, Dad. - I know that, honey. (gentle music) - Wait a minute, now hold on a second. You stick your nose in our business, let me tell you something. The only reason you want Lydia to stay away is so you have a free babysitter. - [Lydia] Danny. - And you know it. - Listen. - You have a free baby- - What? What do you want me to do? - I'm am not gonna go back to you. - Listen, just tell her to stay out of it, all right. You're a grown woman. - Watch the kid, man, come on. - All right, we're gonna talk about this a little more. Stay out of this! We're gonna talk about it ourselves alone. - Lydia, don't go! - You're really making me angry. - Oh, well, listen. I just remember- - Chill out. - What's going on out here? - None of your damn business. That's what's going on out here. - Why don't you leave before I call the police. - So you're gonna call the police? - Yes, I'm gonna call the police. - Wait minute, be a man and I'll do anything you want. - You don't have to do this. - It's all right, Mr. Porter. I'm, I'll be fine, just don't call the police, please. Thank you. (door slams) - You all right? - She's all right. It's just a lover's quarrel, that's all. - You don't have to do this. (engine revving) - It's okay. She's gonna be back. They're just gonna go talk, okay. It's okay. It's okay. (door closes) - Did you get any sleep at all last night? - Mm, couple hours. - Bored with the treadmill? - I'm doing this for Matt. I did it for all the girls, remember. - I remember. I don't know, but he might have to wait a couple of years to use this. - Ah. - Oh, honey, you've healthier than you've ever been in your life. You're gonna dance at Matt's wedding and it better be with me. Your jacket came out great. We have to be ready by five. Did you remember to take your medicine? - Yeah. - Mom, does this look as bad as I think it does? - Open the jacket. - I must have gained 10 pounds. - That's better. - It looks fine, really. - You're not even looking. - Why do you do that? - Do what? - You know how important your opinion is to her. - She's so touchy about everything I say. - She has absolutely no self confidence, John. Just because the girls are grown doesn't mean they don't need your approval. You look nice. - Hi, Mrs. Porter, hi, I just wanted, oh, I'm sorry, love, hi, I just want to thank you so much for everything, you and your husband and I want to give you some money. This is only part of what I owe, but I'm good for the rest. I just got a second job. - Well, you pay when you can. Just take care of that little girl. - Yeah. I also wanna give you my new address in Rockwater and my phone number at work. I would have given you my new home phone number, but it's not connected yet. I just don't want you to think I'm skipping out on you. Hey, I wanna thank you much for the toys. I left them on the bed. - You're welcome. - You people have been so nice. Thank you so much. - Bye. - Thank you. - You be good, bye. - There goes trouble. Where's your dad's boutonniere? - Oh, God. - Don't tell me you forgot it. I ordered it I just... - [Natalie] Forgot to pick it up. - I'll be right back. - Never mind. It doesn't- - Good, you're here. - Actually, I was just leaving. - Well, aren't you supposed to watch the office? - Yeah, I just have to go get something, some cigarettes and I'll be right back. - I thought you quit. - I did. I'll be back in a flash. - She's just going- - I don't need to know. (gentle music) (tires squealing) (door closes) - I'm saying flat out all he said is that at 7 o'clock, he's gone. - Why you laughing at me, man? My cart busted. - I'm not talking about your truck. It's not about your truck, man. All I'm saying is that we have to steal a car or something. - Danny. You're on parole. - Oh, great. All I'm saying is that we don't have a car. - What about Frank? You call Frank? - Yeah, I called Frank? What do you think? - What about Jesus? Did you talk to Jesus? - Jesus is- - Jesus is dead, man. - I'm just saying in a couple of, sorry, buddy. - Sorry. - Here, let me get that for you. - That was real cool. - What I'm saying is in a couple of hours, in a couple of hours, we're gonna be out and you don't wanna go without, man. We don't- - Danny, chill. - Wanna go without. - Chill. - I'm cool. - Chill. (gentle music) - [Lydia] I know her, I know her. Hey, Sarah, Sarah. - Hi, how you doing? - I'm all right. Listen, me and Danny, we really need a ride. Could you- - You know, I'm in such a hurry, I just, I gotta get home. - You know what, it's only like a couple miles- - Sarah, right. Hi, see the thing is we just need to go, it's just a little short way. - You know what, you guys, normally I would, it's just my parents are waiting for me. - [Lydia] Sarah, please, come on. Could you just do this for us, please? - Just this time. - Okay, okay. (gentle suspenseful music) (door closes) - This is ridiculous. - Look, why don't you guys go on ahead. I'll say here till Sarah shows up. - Roger's right. - Maybe she had car trouble. - Well, we can't keep them waiting. - I'll see you later. (suspenseful music) (Lydia laughing) - I don't think I need any more of these. Here, thanks. You want some trouble, huh, I'll give you some trouble. Now, wait a minute. Don't, you're gonna spill the joint. You're gonna spill it. Just stop it, okay, look, I'm spilling it all over the place. Not now, okay, not now. - This league award is long overdue. - Oh, I think we just- - No, no, really, we have all been touched by your kindness at one time or another. - Look at him. He's having the time of his life, Prince Charming. - He barely knows that woman. You think they were best friends. - Yeah, well strangers have always been easier for him. You know that. - Listen, I'm gonna sneak out and call the motel, see if Roger's had any calls. - Mom, it's Sarah for God sakes, she's fine. She probably just ran into some friends. - Stop it. Rob, take this. (Lydia laughing) What are you, what are you doing? - Look, you guys are just gonna have to get out here, okay, um. - What? Hold this. - I'm sorry, my folks are waiting for me back home and I... - You see, the thing is all you gotta do is just drive us to the country and then you just drive us right back. That's not that complicated, is it, huh? Okay. Okay. Nice. (suspenseful music) (guests applauding) - Thank you. Thank you. (gentle music) - We can't ride without tunes. - It's broken. - Maybe I'll fix it for you sometime. - That's all right. - Pretty hair. Ever wanna bleach it, just let me know. - [Sarah] Why are you doing this? - We're not doing anything, what is that? (horn blowing) (tires squealing) - Oh, whoa. God. - Rob! Hey, get the keys Rob. Rob, she took the keys. She took the keys. Where's she going? Stupid bitch. Hey! Come on. (dramatic music) Hey, just give us the keys. Come here. Come here! There she is. (Danny laughing) - Oh, we got you now! We got you! - [Danny] Give me those keys. - Hey. - Hey, come on. - Hey. - Come on, quit playing possum. - [Rob] Quit messing around. - Hey, wait, wait a minute. I don't think she's breathing. - I think she's dead. - No, shut up, man, don't say that. She's all right. Hey! Hey! Come on. - I think she's dead. - Hey, wake up. - All right, here, come on. - [Rob] Wait. - I didn't do anything. Come on man, come on. All right, let's go. (gentle music) Do it. (gentle music) (thunder roaring) (dog barking) Let's go. - What the hell is going on? What the hell is going on, where is she? - Take these. - Where's Sarah? - She's gonna be all right. - Danny. - Take that. - Danny, I swear to God. - Would you just... - Rob, get off me. Where is she? - Get in the car. - [Lydia] What the hell did you do? - [Rob] Just shut up, everything's cool. (engine revving) We gotta make it up there. - [Lydia] Where is she, Danny? - Stop asking questions, all right? (tires squealing) - Is there anybody else that we can talk to? Anybody else from the beauty parlor? Okay, thank you. Please let us know if you hear from her. - Don't you think we should call the police? - No, Mom, you're getting yourself all upset over nothing. - Your sister's been missing for five hours. - Mom, she's fine. Look, call us when you hear from her. We have to go relieve the babysitter. - Goodnight, Daddy. - It's gonna be fine. - [Roger] It's gonna be okay, Mom. - Maybe I, maybe I should drive around, see if I can spot her car. - I'll go with you. - All right. (door closes) - God, the stunts Sarah pulls. I can't believe I have to start a new job tomorrow and now all I can do is think about her. She's fine, right? - Yeah, yeah, she's gonna be fine. (gentle music) - Nothing. - I called the police. - Why? Why would you do that? - They won't officially list her as missing until she's gone for 24 hours. I did talk to Ben Warren. I gave him a description of the car and I told him what Sarah was wearing and he said he would do everything he can. (gentle music) (thunder rolling) (dramatic music) (siren blaring) - Be cool, just be cool. Evening, Officer. - There's an attempt to locate on this car. Is there a Sarah Porter in this vehicle. - Yeah, I'm Sarah Porter, I'm Sarah Porter. - Says here you're wearing a red sweater and tan pants. - You know what, I just changed, so. - Also a ring, heart shaped. - Yeah, see, ring. - Okay. - Okay. - Make sure to call your mom. Drive safe. - [Lydia] Thanks. (phone ringing) - I'll get it. Yes? Thank God. Thank you. - [Sandy] What is she doing driving around with two guys, who are they? - I don't know. Maybe they're friends, maybe it's a boyfriend. - Mom, Sarah doesn't have a boyfriend. - Maybe she does, maybe she just didn't tell us. - What are they doing in the middle of nowhere at 2 o'clock in the morning and why hasn't she called us? She obviously knows we're looking for her. The cops must have told her that and besides didn't the cop say that one of the guys was driving. Sarah never lets anyone behind the wheel of that car. She loves that car. Mom, this just doesn't make any sense. - What are you saying? That wasn't your sister in the car? - [Sandy] I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just thinking out loud. Dad, what should we do? - It's the middle of the night. There's nothing we can do right now. (clock ticking) (dog barking) - I'm waiting for Ben to get to the station. Then Sandy and I are gonna go see him. He'll help us. - Honey, we're not even sure that we need help. - Fine, John. You say here. Just ignore what's going on. We both know how you do that. I'm sorry. She's in trouble, John. - Natalie, I think you're overreacting to this. I think you just gotta give her... - You remember when she was little in the second grade. I was out shopping and I had this terrible feeling something had happened to her. I had to get to that school. Do you remember? She fell off the jungle gym and broke her arm. They'd been trying to reach me. I had a sixth sense about Sarah, John, you know that. I have to go to the police. Sarah wasn't in that car, I know it. Sandy are you ready? - [Sandy] Come on, Mom, let's go. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Yeah, yeah. Yes, that's my daughter's car. Yeah, just a second, let me get something to write oh, hold on. Yeah, okay, go ahead. Yeah. Right. Thank you very much. (John sighing) - They found the car in the worst section of Rockwater. You're damn lucky there's anything left. Somebody parked it right next to a fire hydrant. Not too bright. There's a $90 impound fee and then it's yours. (engine revving) (gentle music) - Are you sure he knows we're here. - [Woman] Yes, ma'am. - Mom, maybe we should come back another time. They seem pretty busy. - [Ben] Okay, Walt, I'll let you know. - Hello, Natalie. - Ben. - Thank you for seeing us. You remember my daughter, Sandy. - Of course, Sandy, nice to see you again. Natalie, as soon as I got your phone call, I got a report from the North Adams precinct from an officer, George Colby. Now he's the officer that pulled Sarah's car over and everything seemed to be in order so I'm not sure I see what the problem is here. - We don't think that was Sarah in the car. She would have called home. It doesn't make sense she'd be 50 miles from home in the middle of the night. - Why don't we go inside? - Here's the file you asked for Ben. - Thank you. You know, Natalie, you're a good mom and good moms have a tendency to worry about their daughters even if they're just late from the mall by half an hour. - She's not late. She's missing. Over 15 hours. This is not something Sarah would do. - No, it's something she has done, Natalie. You don't remember that rock concert about two years ago, what was she gone two days? - This is different. She was just going to the florist. She was coming right back. (phone buzzing) - [Woman] Lieutenant? - Excuse me. Yeah, I'll be right there. All right, look, here's what I suggest you do. I think you should probably go home and stay by the phone because I'm sure she's gonna be calling you. - [Woman] Ben we need you. - All right, all right, I'm on my way. I'm sorry, Natalie, can you excuse me. - Ben. Something's happened to her. I know it. You have to put out a missing person's report. - I can't put out a missing person's report because Sarah's not missing. Sandy. (phone ringing) - Come on, Amy, we gotta go. - I'm saving money to buy a house. A big one. - Oh, well, I will contribute if you promise me you'll paint my room pink. Thank you. Come on, let's go again. (Lydia laughing) - Hey, Amy. - Hey, Danielle. Can I get a beer? - I want you to go into your room. - [Amy] But Mommy. - Now. - Excuse me. - You're excused. I'm tired. - Hey, Amy. (all laughing) - Lydia, I want you and your buddies to get out of my house right now. - You mean you? - But this is my apartment, too. - Dammit, get out of my house, right now Danny, get the hell out of my apartment. - Danielle, would you chill, chill. - Oh, don't touch me. Shut up. - Would you stop it. Don't talk to my husband like that. - What are you talking about? - Hey. - Last night we got married. - That's the truth, sis. - Watch the stuff. - Oh, God. - I'm sorry, Danielle. God, will you stop it. - Dad. - No, this is Ed. Is that you, Martha? - Yeah, is Mom or Dad there? - No, they're both gone. I'm not sure where. - Have you heard from Sarah. - No, no word from Sarah. - Okay, will you tell them that I called, please? - I'll tell them. - Thanks. (upbeat rock music) - Yeah, no that's okay, man. I'm with it all the way, that's rockin'. Yeah. Brother, okay. No, no, no, I'll get back to you. Just let me know, cool. - What? (Lydia laughing) What are you, what are you doing? - Honolulu, Thursday. - What? - You see, now that we're married, I know how to take care of my wife. - Danny, how you gonna get the money for Honolulu? - Don't you worry about the money. I got something worked out. - What, Danny? I think we're in enough trouble already, don't you? - No. I don't think we're in trouble as long as nobody says nothing to nobody. - Officer George Colby. I got his name from the Rockwater police station. Okay, then give me his home number. My daughter is missing. He identified her. No, you don't understand, we're sure that wasn't her. Please, I have to talk to Officer Colby. Please, can't you connect me to his home? You're the police, you're supposed to help me. They hung up on me. Where have you been? I've been worried sick. What? What is it? - They found Sarah's car abandoned in Rockwater. - Oh, my God. - There's no sign of Sarah. That florist is four miles from here. Four miles, with a shopping center full of people. I don't understand, I just don't understand. So what were the police saying? - They don't believe us. They keep saying she's not missing and the officer who supposedly saw her is off duty until tomorrow. - Well, so what are they gonna do? - Nothing. - All right, well, we'll find her ourselves. (gentle music) - I talked to the florist. He said she came in, paid for the boutonniere and left. - Was she with anyone? - No, and I talked to her friends again and they still haven't heard from her. (gentle music) - Sorry. (gentle music) - You have to call Eric and get him to put Sarah's picture on the news. - Mom, we're barely speaking to each other. - He produces the show, doesn't he? - We're separated. He won't even take my calls. - Then I guess you'll have to go there in person. - Mom, please don't do this to me, please. - We have to hurry, it's gonna be dark in a couple of hours. She's afraid of the dark. She's always been afraid of the dark. (gentle music) (suspenseful music) - The spotted puppy woke up first. He looked everywhere for his mother. For a minute he was scared, but then he heard her bark and he knew she was nearby. - Lydia. I wanna talk to you right now. - Okay. Take your nap, my sweetie. I love you. See you in a while. What's going on? - What the hell is this? - Somebody's purse. - Sarah Porter's purse. Found it in the dumpster outside. Got a prescription box, got her name all over it. Tell me how it got in there. - Who put it in there, Lydia? - All right. Sarah gave me this purse at the motel, all right and I don't know about that. There's prescriptions inside, I don't know. - And you just threw this purse away? - Yeah, I don't like it very much, Danielle. - I don't believe you. - Believe what you wanna believe. - Lydia. - What? - You gotta stop this. You gotta stop this. You left him once before and you can do it again. I'll help you. I'll be there for you, I promise. - [Danny] Hey, Lydia! Lydia, you up there? - Yeah. - You're way too smart for this. - Hey. Hey, hey. - Hey. - You tell him. - Ooh. Uh-oh. I don't know, I don't know, I'll see you. I guess I just can't live like this. All right, I just can't. Don't worry about me, all right, Danielle. Everything will be cool. I just think it'd be better. All right, come on, Danny, let's go. - [Danny] Well, wait up. (door closes) - Alicia, please think. Is there anyone else? I mean, did you ever hear her talk about any other friends? - Well, maybe. No, she wouldn't do that. - [John] Do what? - She had a boyfriend for a while, Chris. - Who? - Chris Prince. But that ended a long time ago. - Who is he? I've never heard of him. - Well, that doesn't surprise me. - Why? - She knew you wouldn't like him. (welder whirring) - Excuse me, hey. Hey, are you Chris Prince? - Hang on a second. - My daughter is Sarah Porter. Do you know where she is? - I have no idea where she is. - Well, she's missing. Sarah's missing. - I'm sorry, but I haven't talked to her in over two years. - We're looking for her. - I would like to help, but like I said. Are you okay? Mr. Porter? Are you okay? (phone ringing) - He's okay. He's gonna be okay. He's sedated now. - What about you? - I'm fine. I wanna get back in there. - I spoke to Ed. He said he could stay at the motel tonight. - Good. - Well, I have to go, 'cause Matt's with a sitter. - Where's Roger? - On a business trip. Well, he tried to get out it, but he couldn't. - Well, what time are you gonna be able to get here tomorrow? - Mom, I started a brand new job today. - This is family, Martha. Family comes first. - No, Mom, Sarah's come first. She always has and she always will. - Don't you dare start this again. - Mom, this job is important to me. I have worked my whole life to get a job like this. - More important than your sister. - Oh, that is so unfair, okay. I am always there, always. But I have responsibilities, too, and I'm not about to ignore them when I'm not even sure Sarah's in trouble. She's cried wolf before, Mom, too many times. - Fine. - Mom, come on. - It's okay, it's okay. (phone ringing) (Martha crying) (monitor beeping) (gentle music) (John coughing) - Welcome back. - Sarah? Is Sarah home? - Not yet. She will be very soon. What are you doing? - I gotta get outta here. Where are my clothes? - Shh, now don't act crazy. - Where are my clothes? - Shh. Shh. Look. This wasn't another heart attack, but the doctor said it is a warning. You're pushing yourself too hard. Rest. Please. - How am I gonna rest? I can't just stay here and do nothing. She's my daughter. I'm supposed to be there for her. I'm supposed to be there. I'm supposed to be there to protect her. I'm supposed to be there to keep her safe. I'm supposed to... (John groaning) I remember my father's hospital room. I remember he was laying there in bed. All kinds of tubes coming out of him, just like me. I remember I was just sitting there watching him. Watching him and, and hoping. Hoped. Just like you. - I've been married to you for 30 years and for 30 years you've been waiting to die young because your father did. Well, you know what? It hasn't happened and it's not going to. - Now, you can push us away as hard as you want. We're not going anywhere and neither are you. (gentle music) - She's my girl. She's my girl. (gentle music) - The truth, Jan. - That's right, Michael, in fact four of them. - [Man] And they actually got married, the two pigs. The one pig was really hogging up the wedding cake. - Oh, that just shows you. - I wonder if that was... - We thought maybe you could put her picture on the news as a missing person. - Sandy, I'm confused. I thought you just said she wasn't missing. - No, the police don't think she's missing, but we do. - I don't get it. Is this some kind of sick joke? To be honest, you know, I've never really gotten your sense of human. Excuse me. - It's not about us, Eric. This is about Sarah. - Well, until the police list her as missing, then she's not missing, so there's nothing I can do about it. - [Woman] Eric Cosner, pick up line two. Call on line two. - Cosner. Yeah, hold on. Sandy, I know your family. You're getting yourself all hysterical over nothing. I've seen it before. Hell, I've lived it before. - [Sandy] Eric. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, what is it? - I'm sorry I wasted your time. - Listen, what's so important? - Danielle, Lydia's sister. She found that girl's purse. And now she's walking around acting like she knows something and I talked to Lydia and she says she didn't say nothing, but I just wanna make sure. I just wanna talk to her, you know. Hey, could we order, please. - What the hell are you two doing here? - Service with smile. - Yeah, it leaves a little something to be desired, don't it? - You need to get the hell outta here or I'm gonna call the manager. - Oh, why? What, we do something wrong? What did we do? - I didn't do anything. - I know you think you got Lydia, Danny, but you don't. - Jeez, Danielle. How long has it been since you have it? - Mm-mm. - 'Cause I can hook you up with my buddy, here. - Shut up. I'll take care of it. - All right. You do that. - I'll take care of it. - [Sandy] I don't know why I expected him to come through for me now. - The nurses promised to keep a close eye on your father. I feel helpless just sitting there. - Mom, this might not be such a good idea. I think we'd be better off waiting at the motel instead of driving all the way to North Adams. - Ed's at the motel, he'll get any call. - Hi. I, um, I looked at my baby sleeping safely in his bed last night and hmm, one day on the job and I call in sick. There's goes employee of the month. I'm so glad daddy's okay. - If I can just talk to them in person, I know they'll listen to me. We are not leaving that police station till I see Officer Colby. - Mom, I, I, I- - I want him to look at the flyer and then look me in the face and tell me that that was Sarah in that car Sunday. (horn blowing) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) Please. - Ma'am, I told you on the phone a dozen times, Colby doesn't start his shift till 11. - Well, maybe you could give me his home number or the address, I'll just go there. - Look, I'm gonna give you a piece of advice, back off. - Back off? - You're way out of line. - Something has happened to my daughter. Your Officer Colby is the only person who knows if Sarah was in that car. You won't let me talk to the only person who can help me and I'm out of line. - Mom, um, why don't we go get a cup of coffee and come- - No. I am not leaving this spot until I talk to that man. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't eat this 'cause I haven't paid for them yet. - Mommy, you forgot the chocolate chip cookies. - No, you said you wanted donuts. - I got my own money. - Good for you. Come on. Chocolate chip cookies are next week. Here, grab the tomatoes. - I can buy them. - Good. I'm gonna go get some shampoo, just do the tomatoes. Excuse me. Yes. Okay. Amy? Amy, come on, I gotta go. Amy, this isn't funny. Amy? Excuse me. Amy! Amy! Amy! - [Clerk] Can I help you with something? - I can't find my kid. - What's the name? - Amy. - I'll page her. - Amy, hey Amy. - Will you come to the front of the store? Your mother's looking for you. - Damn. Don't you ever do that to me again. - The ride's not over yet. And even when it is, kids just seem to like me. Maybe it's because they know how much I like them. Right, Amy? Maybe next time, we'll get to go on a real horsey back ride. Of course that next time is up to your mommy. - Okay. It's okay. Okie dokie. Okie dokie. (doctor knocking) - Mr. Porter, I'm Dr. Greenwood. Your physician was called into surgery and asked me to take a look at you. - When am I getting released? - I'm afraid that Dr. McPherson is gonna have to make that call. What's a matter, the food getting you now? - My daughter's missing, I wanna find her. - I'm sorry, I didn't know that. - I've got three daughters. Sarah's the youngest. - I'm sure she's just fine. - Yeah. - Officer Colby. - You wanted to see me? - Officer Colby? I'm Natalie Porter. You stopped my daughter's car Sunday night. - I know who you are, I got your messages. - Please, take a look at this picture. Look closely, please. Tell me that's the girl in the car two nights ago. - That's her. - You hardly looked at it. - That's here, that's the girl I spoke to. - You're 100% sure? - 100%, no. 95, you bet. You'll have to excuse me now. - Did he make a fist or- - Hey, Joe. - Hey, George. I'm sorry, ma'am. - Excuse me, Officer Colby, please. One more look, please. - That's her, that's the girl I spoke to. Cute, brown hair, blue eyes. - My daughter has brown eyes, she has brown eyes. - Oh, it was dark. She had that heart-shaped ring and that small tattoo on her hand. - My daughter doesn't have a tattoo. (phone ringing) - Esterly. - Yeah. - I think you'd better listen to Mrs. Porter. - Within five minutes' time, every precinct in this state will know who Sarah Porter is and every officer will be looking for her. I want you to know that I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Porter. - You're wasting time, Officer, find my daughter, then apologize. - I have to go the office, but I'll drop you guys off and catch up with you later. - We better hurry, I need to make a stop first. (gentle music) - Well, pull the remote and have them get down to the courthouse now. No, not in five minutes, now. - [Sandy] I need to talk to you, Eric. - Oh, not now. - It'll only take a minute. This is the APB on Sarah. The North Adams Police Department has officially listed her as missing. - Sandy, there's been a break in that molestation trial. There's also a small plane crash out on the highway and I'm up to my ass in all of this. Now, I'm sorry about Sarah, I really am. - It's just that she's not important enough, is that what you were gonna say? She's not important enough to put on your news. This is my sister, Eric. She's part of my family. She was part of your family for five years and she's in trouble and you can help her. You can help us. Now I want you to put her picture on the news. I want you to do that for her because you owe her that. (gentle music) (door opens) (door closes) - Where the hell have you been? - What do you mean where have I been? I told you I had to go see somebody. - Danielle just called me from work an hour ago. She said that Rob tried to take Amy. What is that, Danny? - You know if I wasn't here right now, she's be trying to tell you that I was taking Amy, honey. - You promised that you would not involve my sister in this, you promised me. I can't believe this. - Listen, all your sister has to do is keep your nose out of our business. - But you don't know nothing. - What? - I just can't deal with this. Why don't we leave or something? - Okay. Okay. I'll call the airline. I'll hook it up right now. - Okay. - I'll call him now, we'll go tonight, we'll meet tonight. - Mm-hmm. - Okay? - Okay, yeah. - Hey, come on, honey. - You know what? I just wanna be alone. (gentle music) - Okay. Bloody Mary. - [Reporter] The shortage of rainfall this season has left the area particularly dry and vulnerable to fire. We'll have a detailed update on the efforts to contain the fires and the weather. On the local front, a local family have contacted the state's attorney for a potential tragic accident. Local resident, Sarah Porter has been reported missing from her family home for the past 46 hours and is now thought to be the victim of kidnapping. - I hope I'm not disturbing you, Mr. Porter. The manager at your motel told me where I could find you. - No, no, Danielle, it's okay. What is it? - Oh, I can't believe I'm gonna say this about my own sister. - What? Tell me. Where are they, Danielle. Tell me where they are. - I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know. - Mom, you're exhausted. You need some rest. You're not gonna be any good to anybody if you keep going at this pace. - I'm fine. It's your father that needs rest. I hope he's sleeping. (dramatic music) - Yeah, thanks, keep that. - Thanks. - John, I thought you were in the hospital? What are you doing here? (engine revving) (dramatic music) - Natalie, all I know is that a woman called here. It sounded urgent to me so I gave her John's number at the hospital. 20 minutes later, he storms in, then storms back out. Never said a word. - What was her name? Ed, what was the woman's name? - Natalie, I don't remember her name. - You have to remember. We'll be right there. - Lydia. Lydia, answer me. - She's not here. - Where is she? - She's out doing an errand. She'll be back in a while. - What's this. - Huh? - What's this stuff? - Well, we're leaving. Isn't that what you want us to do? - You bastard. What'd you do to that girl, huh? You know what, her picture's all over the TV, Danny. And they're gonna come looking for you and they're gonna find you 'cause I'm gonna help them. - Hey. Pretty girl. (Amy whimpers) Pretty girl, pretty girl, won't you be my pretty girl. Pretty girl, pretty girl. (dramatic music) (horn blowing) - How could you let him just walk out of here? - I couldn't do anything about it - He's been in the hospital, you know he's been sick. - Mom. - Where is he? What is he doing? Sorry, Ed. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. (engine idling) - Just stay right there, I'll be right down. - [Lydia] Wait, I just wanna say goodbye or something. - No, your sister just left with Amy, honey. Just send her a postcard, I'll be right there. Just hold on a second. I just go through a couple things in the bag there. - We'll just wait for them to take off and then you and me and your mommy will go for a long ride. (dramatic music) You brought this on yourself, you know. - Maybe he heard something good, some lead. - Doesn't make sense. He would have left a message. - Excuse me, Mrs. Porter. I was just listening to the radio in my car and I heard about Sarah. Well, I saw her, Sarah, on Sunday at Rockwater in the shopping center. Yeah, she was with the, those people that stayed here, the ones whose house burned down, you know. - Ed, the woman who called, was her name Lydia or Danielle? - Danielle, that was it? - She gave me her address, it's in the cash box. - Who are you calling? - The police. That's it. (dramatic music) - I'll call you, Rob, okay? (doors close) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, get in the car. - Wait a minute. - [Danny] Get in the car. - Where is she? (gun cocks) Where's my daughter, where is she? - Get in the car. - Where is she? - Just get in the car. - You son of a bitch, what have you done to her? - I don't know what you're talking about, man, just. - [John] All you gotta to is just tell. - [Danny] Relax, man, because if I tell you. - No! (gun fires) (Lydia screams) - Go, go. (sirens blaring) - Danny, what are you doing? - Police! Get off him. - [Danny] That guy's crazy, get him away from me. - Where is she? Where have you taken her? - I didn't do nothing, you talk to Danny. - You're hurting me. - Get in there. (phone ringing) (door closes) - Nothing. They say they haven't seen Sarah since the motel. - Well, they're lying dammit. - Of course they are, John, but they're not gonna admit to anything we can't prove. - What about Lydia? - Well, she's scared. I don't think she's said a word. - She should be scared. You have to find out where Sarah is. - We're making progress with the girl, Natalie. - Let me talk to her. - No, I don't think that'd be appropriate. - Ben. Ben, let her try. - Okay. - I'll be waiting out here. (phone ringing) - I'm Martha Patterson. My whole family's waiting outside. Where is she? - I don't know nothing. I mean I don't know where she is, you know. - Please. She's my sister. - I'm sorry I can't help you. - You have a sister, don't you? - No, I don't have a sister, all right, not after what she did. - Maybe you didn't leave her any other choice. Maybe she did because she didn't want you to get into worse trouble. Or maybe she did it because she loves you so much. - She don't love me. She hates me, she thinks I'm a loser. - That is not true and you know that's not true. She's right, I called the police for one reason, but it is not because I hate you. I called the police because I love you. I was afraid Dan was gonna take you away and I'd never see you again. Lydia, you are my family. You and Amy are all I've got. If you are in any kind of trouble, I'll do anything to help you, you know that, but you have got to help yourself first. You have got to help the Porters because it is the right thing to do. In the end, you always do the right thing. - I know. - Always. - I know. - Let's get an ambulance out there. - [Woman] It's on its way, sir. - We will call you if we find anything at all. In the meantime, I'd like you to wait here. - No. No more waiting. (siren blaring) - [Natalie] Sarah! Sarah! - [Martha] Sarah! - [Sandy] Sarah! - Sarah! - Sarah! - Sarah! - [Sandy] Sarah! - Sarah! - Sarah! - [Martha] Sarah! - [Sandy] Sarah. - Oh, my God. Stay here. - No, Mom. - Stay there. - No. - Sarah. Sarah. - [Sandy] Is she okay? - I'm here. - [Man] We got her. Get our doctors out here, hurry! - [Man 2] Don't try to move her. - [Man] Let me through here, let me through. Sir, excuse us, please, let us through. Sir, we have to get in there. - [John] Thank God. - She's in pretty bad shape, but she's gonna make it. She's suffering multiple fractures of the head and face, a few broken ribs and some internal bleeding. - I wanna be with her. - She's barely conscious. She may not know you're there. - She'd know. - Give us a few more minutes. (gentle music) - John, I'm sorry. I am so sorry that I didn't believe you when you said she was missing. - Ben, there's no need for that. No one's blaming anybody. - I am, I'm blaming myself. You guys are amazing, you did it. You stuck together and all by yourselves you did it. (gentle music) - She's under pretty deep. I wouldn't expect too much. - Sarah? Honey. - Sarah. Sarah. It's Martha. I'm here. We're all here. - You're safe now, you're with us. - [Natalie] John, talk to her. - Sarah. Sarah. It's Dad. Don't leave us, honey. Don't go away. We need you. I need you. I love you, Sarah. - Mom, look. Dad. - [Martha] Sarah, wake up sweetie. - [Sandy] She's gonna be all right. - Come on, baby. - Sarah. (gentle music) (gentle techno music)
