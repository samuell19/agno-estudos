NAKED CHILDHOOD FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR A DECENT LIFE FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR ADULTS JOBS FOR THE YOUNG - You like it? - Yes. Wrap that up for me, please. - You're ugly. - Look who's talking. - Is there one you like? - Yes. While thousands of us are gathered here, in three other cities of our mining region... - What do you say? - Thank you. - Thank you who? - Thank you, Mom. Can I have a franc to put on a record? Get me some cigarettes too. - What do you want, son? - A pack of Gauloises. Here, young man. Thank you. Two francs is your change. - Here. - Keep the change. Thanks. Here. - These are your picks? - Yes. Sure winners. Anyway, I'm winning. One again. I need more legs. - I just need an eye and the tail. - See the little piggy, Fang? Your marker. It's your turn. What's this, huh? - One. Two. Almost there. Two. I win. Francois, what are you rummaging around in up there? Answer when I talk to you. Get downstairs. Don't just sit there like a dummy. Go on, get out of here. Go on. I bet you can't. What a chicken. What's going on ? Quiet! There are children sleeping. The little bastard shit all over the place. Josette! Bastard! You snitch! Just wait till I catch you! I'll smash your face in, you bastard! - Is he going to die? - No, I'll look after him. Hello, Mrs. Joigny. Francois, come say hello to the director. - What did you do? - He's always fighting. Go and play, but don't go far. I'll call you in a while. Isn't Josette here? Yes. She spent the night at her granny's and just got back. Robert wallpapered her room. Do you want to see it? You've really spoiled her. Whatever she dreams of, she gets. So Francois is still sleeping on the landing? - Something to drink? - No, thanks. We can't handle Francois anymore. Sorry, but I don't trust him. He's sneaky and perverted. When I wash them, I tell him not to look, but he still leers at Josette. I told you last year he was a difficult child. That's right. I didn't want another one. Robby wanted a boy, especially after my operation. And I didn't want Josette to be an only child. I was one, and it was awful. The things he's put us through! I couldn't get him to eat. I had to let him eat all by himself. If I stood next to him, he wouldn't eat a thing. I'd go out in the garden but later find he still hadn't touched a thing. He's not like other children. You never know what he's thinking. When I told you he wet his bed, you said to let him lie in it. I did what you said, and it cured him all right, but you know what he does now? He gets up and pees around the bed. We've tried so hard. We don't treat them any differently. We spoil him as much as her. Robby tried. He asked him to help fix up some things around here. It seemed to work. He seemed happy to be of use. Like a different boy. Then suddenly he turns horrible again. He doesn't want to do anything at school either. He's not stupid. He's a clever boy, but only when it suits him. And he's not just a terror. He steals too. Shopkeepers have come by to complain. Last time he stole a Kelton watch. Robby had to pay for it. These things get around. People know he's not ours, but still... And they just aren't like other children. For one, we don't know where they're from. And I worry about Josette. She's changed so much with him here. Can I see her? Hello, Josette. Don't you get along with Francois? - She's always nice to him. - What does he do to you? - Nothing. So you do like him? Would you be sad if he left? Yes. Go and play. She doesn't seem to hate him. Kids always fight. It's normal. He gets up at night. What's a 10-year-old doing up then? Listen, my nerves have had it. It sounds stupid, but I'm scared of him. Say something, Robby. We really didn't think it would be this hard. We're fond of the boy, but it's for his sake too. We think he'd be happier with another family. We just don't hit it off. We've done all we could. You didn't have to bathe Josette in front of him. Will you take him back? He's even said he doesn't want to stay. What about school? He must have friends there. I don't even want to know what he does at school. The kids he brings home are little hooligans, and they don't last long either. He spends the whole day alone, breaking everything in sight. He likes to destroy things. If you added up everything he's broken around here... Fine. Then there's no point in continuing. But don't ask for another one next month. No danger of that. One was enough for me. You can keep the rest. It's not like we're in it for the 220 francs a month. Can I see Francois? So Francois, you don't like it here? Josette, go see what Francois is up to. Francois, where are you? I'm full. At least have some coffee. Where's Fang? Mom! Francois killed Fang. That's the last straw! What did he do to him? He threw him down the stairs. He promised he'd take care of him. - Why didn't you say anything? - I thought he'd take care of him. - Where's your brown sweater? - In the closet. Put the rest in your bag. I hope the social worker gets here early. Get up. Come on, it's time. - You want croissants? - Yes. - Here. - Thanks. Francois has come to say good-bye. For me? You shouldn't have. We do a convoy like this the last Thursday of every month. We take five or six children. Today we've got ten. Of those ten, two are - Let's check their name tags. I think they were abandoned. This one's tag says “AC,” for “abandoned child.” See? This one too. No one wanted to adopt these two little boys. It says “AC,” “abandoned child.” Nobody in Paris wanted them, so I'm taking them back to Arras. I think there's a couple there waiting to adopt one. The last group - Behave now. In the last group I returned with, we had a black child, and that couple didn't want him. The man was willing, but the woman didn't want him. See this boy? He's not part of the group. We're just taking him back. How old are you? - Ten. What's your name? Francois Fournier. Who are your foster parents? Who are you living with? Mrs. Joigny. Do you like it there? Are they nice? You like them, don't you? How long have you been there? Three or four years? I think it's four years. How long's it been? I think I heard four years. Have you got a brother or sister living there with you? - I don't have a brother. - A sister? No? I thought you did. So you're an only child. Do you go to school there? Do you learn a lot? You don't seem very happy. Sit down properly. You too. I was in tears when I started this job. I'd arrive in Paris at the foster care center. They take in young children between one and two. We take them from two on up. It would break my heart to see all those children waiting for a mommy and daddy. We'd usually take one or two, and it would really get to me, seeing all the others without - It's like all those kids are just waiting. I'm used to it now, but it was hard at first. You'll get used to it too. I hope it's not another black child. I don't want one of those. This is Vincent. We'll take this one. I've had my eye on him. You won't be disappointed. He's a sweetie. Give the lady your hand. - Give me your hand. We'll go for a drive. Come on. Off we go. You're not going to cry, are you? No, he won't cry. It's just all new for him. Come on. Let's go get some candy. Hear that? You're going to get some candy. I'll walk you out. We'll go get some candy. Come on. I'm very pleased to welcome you here. I believe you'd like to take in a child? Do you have a postal account? You'll need to go to the post office with your ID card and open a postal account. The stipend will be transferred to your account every month. You'll receive 216 francs for the child. This child was abandoned. His name is Vincent. He's very sweet. I'm sure you'll give him lots of love. And if you get along well, you may be able to adopt him. I hope so. Good luck, madame. We'll place the brother and the sister in the same family. All right. “Ripert, Jean, 9/20/65. From Malakoff. Court order.” No other information. I may be able to place him in a family. Mrs. Souchet has other children of the same age. Very good. “Michaud, Magali.” The little girl with the pointed hat. “January 16, 1963. Temporary placement.” Mrs. Sénéchal? - I'll put her down for Saint-Paul. Mommy! - How's Raoul? - Same as always. He's at school. You'll see him later. Would you like something to eat? - No, thanks. He's not hungry after all he ate at lunch. - You want to see my shed? - Yes, sir. See? This is where I work. I take care of odd jobs for Grandma, and sometimes for the neighbors. - Is that your van? - Yes. Let's go have a look. See? I made this. - What's this? - That's for vegetables. This is for the butane tank. This is the cupboard, and this is women's stuff. So you brought me a little boy? The thing is, we're leaving on vacation. When? July or August. It depends. Well, we can cross that bridge then. I'll come see you before you leave. All right. He's not a terror, is he? Francois was in fifth grade in Lens. Try and get him into the same grade as soon as possible. All right. You know this is a temporary placement. - Does he know his parents? - Barely. His mother hasn't written to him in a year, but she can take him back whenever she wants. I'll give her your address. Reply to her if she writes, but as usual, don't give too many details. All right. - May I see the little girl's booklet? - Of course. You'll see. It's a lot of fun. We'll go there every Sunday. Okay? Grandpa, I got the highest grade on the algebra test. - Ah, you're back. - Look. That's great. A 95. Very good. Look, this is young Francois. We've been expecting him. This is Raoul. He'll be your big brother. I haven't seen your mother. Is she ill? No, she's resting. She's just tired. Look how well my boy's doing in school. A 95 in algebra. Come on. I'll show you your room. Hello, Raoul. Good work. You've made progress. You know what you want to do later? - Electronics. This is your room. This is the desk where you'll do your homework. This is the closet for your things. And keep it tidy, okay? This is your bed. This other bed is for Jean-Claude. He comes by sometimes on Saturdays, but this is your room. You like your new buddy Raoul? I'll come back and see you. No, don't go out. You'll catch cold. Bye, Valérie. - I'm sure everything will be fine. - I hope so. I'll come see you in a couple weeks. All right. Go easy on that bike! Good-bye, Mrs. Thierry. Mr. Thierry. - What's your name? - Francois. You'll see. You'll be just fine here. - Here, Mother. - You brought me a new little friend. - Aren't you eating? - I'm not hungry. - Try to eat something. - I'm not hungry. Stop eating bread and the food will go right down. Leave him alone. When he's hungry, he'll eat. - We never eat enough for you. - Eating's important. Raoul, get the napkin rings from the drawer. Here, Grandpa. Here. Grandma doesn't like the napkins to get mixed up. Show Francois what you do with the napkins. Later. - Don't start that silliness again. - It's not me. It's Raoul. Then I'll do it. Aunt Claire, would you like a little dessert? - I'd love some. - You have a sweet tooth, eh? - Is this the new boy? - Yes. - What's your name? - Francois. - Where is he from? - A mining family in Lens. Are his parents still alive? They're not telling us much, as usual. - So he's not long-term. - It's temporary. For a few months, or until he comes of age. - Tell everyone, why don't you? - It's nothing bad. It's not as if you're my mom. If you keep this up, I'll run away. - Go ahead. Where would you go? - I'll join the buccaneers. Who are they? Prisoners living on their own on an island. Fine! Where will you get the money? İf anyone hurts Grandma, I'll kill them, even if it means 50 years in jail. I can't stand people criticizing Grandma and Grandpa. Why? They're not your parents. I don't even know my parents. Social Services wouldn't tell me anything. You want this pencil sharpener? I don't want it. I've got this. Have you got a father? - Yes. What's he do? - He's a hunter. - Where? Africa. What's he kill? Tigers. Tigers in Africa? You crazy? I made that. I used this as a model. That's the world, and this is Europe. Not bad, eh? You like my room? I decorated it myself. My room before was a lot better. I had a record player and tape recorder, and postcards on the wall. Why didn't you stay there? Did you fight with your father? Or your mother? Do you know your mother? Raoul, enough chatter. The boy's tired. Time for bed. Can't you sleep? Be seated. Come sit down. You'll sit here. Get your things out. Be seated. This is your new classmate. Play with him at recess. Let's continue with the lesson. Everyone sitting up straight? All right. We'll start today with ethics. The story is called “A Miser.” “Mr. Grandet, who is very rich, lives as if he were poor. Every morning he gives his maid Nanon the groceries she needs for the meals. His nephew has just arrived, and Eugénie, Mr. Grandet's daughter, wants to celebrate her cousin's arrival. 'Nanon, make us some crepes.' 'But who will give me firewood and flour and butter?' says Nanon. 'Ask your father. He can give you some. Look, he's going out now for groceries.“ Go back where you came from, bastard. Watch it, you little jerk! Now you come home, after we looked all over? Where were you? Raoul looked everywhere. And that shirt was brand-new! Go get changed. I'm going back to bed. All right, Mother. What are you doing? You haven't changed yet? Hurry UP- Just look at this! Hurry UP- Just look at you. You're filthy. It's all over you. Are you crazy? You little jerk! Look what you did! Get outside. Bring him here. I'll take him upstairs. You asked for it. Listen to that racket. Go see before he tears the whole place down. Who's banging like that? What's going on? It's nothing, Mother. Slap his face with this. What will we do with this child? He's not normal. Don't get all excited. It'll work out. I could have been a carpenter. I took care of everything at home. - Was that your trade? - No. I was a switchman in a mine. I wouldn't want to work in a mine. What would you like to be? - A mechanic. - That's a good job. Listen, if you try that again now, you'll break your foot. You shouldn't have locked me in. You were lucky. I used to get beaten. That's no excuse. Well, that's how I am. I yell and shout, but then it's all over. Are you surprised to see me drinking coffee on Grandpa's lap? We do it a lot. We love each other. You wouldn't know it's a second marriage. We love each other. You wouldn't believe we both have children from other marriages. How many do you have? I have three. Unfortunately I lost a little girl. - And grandchildren? - I have 19 grandchildren. How about that? They'd fill the whole house. How about Grandpa? Grandpa has three children. I still take care of them. When we go on vacation, they hang all over me. It's true. Did you have lots of kids together? Unfortunately not. We would have liked to. But we couldn't. We're too old. Now we take in little children, and we love them just the same. They're our children too. Understand? Why do you take in children like us? Because Grandma was once really, really sad. Grandma liked children very much. Our son got married, and they both went to work to furnish the house. They had a little girl whom I raised until she was two. Then I fell and hurt my leg and had to stay in bed, so my son took the girl away. I would cry every night, all night long. I cried all the time. One day Grandpa said, “if you're gonna cry like that, get some children from Social Services.” And I said, “I will. I'll go tomorrow.” I went to the town hall to ask for a little girl, and they brought me you instead. That's how I got you. Who's that? Jean-Claude? No, that's my nephew. He joined the Resistance early on and got captured right away. I was in my signal box where you signal to the trains. The Germans came for me. It was at night. My mother, the old lady you see here, told my nephew to tell me that the Germans were coming for me. So he came to tell me, and when the Germans got there, I saw them and jumped out the window. From then on, I went underground. I came back to see my nephew. Unfortunately, he'd gone down to the cellar, in a sort of cistern, which I'm sure was empty. Anyway, they fired a shot into the tank. The shot resounded, and he got scared and cried out. The Germans pulled him out and sent him right off to Lille. From there they sent him to Germany, where he died. You see? This is my sister. - Aunt Claire? When the Germans came back, they asked her where I was. She said she didn't know, so they took her away, and she spent two years in prison for not telling them where I was. Here you see all my friends. We all worked together. I got medals. They can't wear theirs, but I wear mine in their honor. - This is a sword. - That's right. See? I've got three. That's all we got. Hold on. Move back. This is a military weapon. See this? Look. You know this guy here, Ho Chi Minh? That's a “Winster.” Winchester, dummy. You can't even read English. Little bastard! You could have killed me! You'll end up a criminal. İf you keep this up, I'll do to you what I did to Raoul. You'll go to school with your undies pinned to your back. Did Raoul go to school like that? No, just down the street. But you'll go all the way to school. - I'd like an ice cream. - I'll be around in a minute. Just wait. What are you doing? - I want one now. - I said I'll come around. - I want it now. - No. - Why not? - I can't sell them here. - Careful. - Stop pushing. Careful, Marcel. You'll get us caught. Everyone shut up. - Did you hide the box? - Yeah. Good job. Yeah, not bad. Nice one. What are those initials? - K. J. - What do they mean? I'm carving my name. Then I'll fill it in with ink. Really? Does it hurt? You don't feel a thing. Could you do me afterwards? If you want. It doesn't hurt? Blood's spurting out. It's nothing. It'll scar. You know this trick? You strike a match and put it out in your palm. - Do it. - Want me to? This is an amazing and shocking story. A man pursues his prey through the wild landscape of New Mexico. He hunts down his enemies, the Bravados - two white men, two mestizos, and one Indian - whom he swore to find - You're just coming home now? Go say hello to your uncle. We've already got the fridge, the table, four chairs... Say hello to Georgette. ...and we're waiting for the rest. This is Joél, Georgette's fiancé. Don't you know him? Maybe you've never seen him. He's Georgette's fiancé, your future uncle. - When's the wedding? - Around Easter. Very nice. Let me see that. Oh, what a beautiful ring! That's very nice. Here's to the wedding! He has good taste. - Yes, he does. He picked it out by himself. What are you doing? That's naughty. That's very nice. Let me pour you some more. When are you coming to visit? Oh, I will. I'm just very busy. Well, whenever you want, just let us know. - What's wrong with your arm? - Nothing. - Is that a little better? - Yes. This will make it feel better. Watch. Why didn't you say someone hit you and you got hurt? We're not the police. You know we like you, don't you? I'll get you something to eat. I'll just wipe my hands. - Eat that. - Thanks. Why would you get hurt in a fight and not tell Grandma? Come on now. Time for bed. You'll feel better tomorrow. Does it still hurt? Let me see your bandage. It's dirty. I'm going to change it. - It doesn't hurt anymore. - It doesn't? Let me see. I guess you're right. Grandma, have you got 50 centimes for the swimming pool? And I need to go get my shoe. Your shoe? More money. Francois, your magazine came. Take the paper to Nana. Ah, my paper. Let me have the comics. You always get them first. I like the comics too. "Guy was right. His mistress Molly was found just six weeks later, exactly as expected. A young lady arrested -” I'm going to read the local news. What's a mistress? - What? A mattress? - No, a mistress. What do you think it is? Well, there are different kinds. There's a schoolmistress. And a man's mistress. Were you ever a man's mistress, Nana? Are you two about done talking nonsense? Go get your shoe at the cobbler's. Mother, if you keep telling him things like that, he won't listen to us anymore. I can explain. Look at the nice postcard your mommy sent you. “My darling little girl, I hope you're behaving and that you're enjoying yourself. Lots of love from Mommy.” - Does Francois hear from his parents? - No. - He never mentions them? - Very rarely. What are you doing up, Mother? - I'm sick of lying in bed. Hello, Claire. - Hello, Nana. - It's going to be a nice day. - Yes, I think so. Francois is really torn up by this situation with his mother. She'll give him up for good. She'll never take him back. And you, have you always been happy? You're Mommy's little baby, aren't you? You know, I love my husband. He looks after my mother in her old age. That's good. She may be old, but she still has her wits about her, and she's still in good health. I hope it continues for a good long time. Unfortunately there's an end to everything. But she's still in good health. - And funny. - Yes, she's quite comical. - Where's your shoe? - It fell down the storm drain. The storm drain? How did that happen? It slipped. Slipped how? And how much was it? - A franc. Another franc? Pull it tight. Now it's right. It wasn't before. Turn that way. I'd have left the shoe where it was. You're worse than the boys. You're always picking on me. Is it okay now, sweetie? - Yes. See? It all worked out. I went down to my garden To gather rosemary Lovely poppy, my ladies Lovely new POPPY You know this one, don't you? Then sing it with me. To gather rosemary I hadn't even gathered three sprigs Lovely poppy, my ladies Lovely new POPPY He climbed up a tree To see his hounds run, carabi The branch broke and Gullieri fell down, carabi - This one. - Make up your mind. My father found me a husband My lord, how short he was! My father found me a husband My lord, he was tiny! His clothes were made from just one leaf My lord, he was tiny! “Christmas,” by Francis Yard. "The Yule log is the heart of family life. When I was your age, my beautiful little girl, on Christmas Eve we would place a big log of wood on the fire. For the three religious festivals - Epiphany, New Year, and Christmas - the flames would dance their way up along the trammel. It seems like only yesterday.” What are you doing? You rummaging through my things? Let's see. What are you looking at? Who's this? Who do you think? You don't know? That's me. Funny, huh? - You're young there. How old were you? I was a young mother there. - What are you reading? - Books. Let me see. “Satanik. ” - Look at this. - This is to get you all worked up! You're too young for books like this. Let's see if your sweater fits. Yes, just fine. - Could you make a polo neck? - Yes, my boy. Francois, are you coming? Grandpa is taking us to the fair. We'll have a good time. Will you get me a doll like the one I bought for Valerie last year? I'll do that, Nana. - I'll give you money. - No, keep it. Get something for Francois and Raoul too. I'd like that. My coin purse. I lost my coin purse. You couldn't have. You had it earlier. No, not that one. - I had 16,000 francs in it. - I'll go check. I'm sure it's under your pillow. Francois probably stole it. I'll go get your coat. See, Mother? I found it. It was under your pillow. I'm so glad. I was really scared. All my savings were in there. Here, Francois. Thank you, Nana. All right, off we go. What's this? Well, I never! Everyone ready? Joel, Agnes? Georgette, look this way. On three. Watch the birdie. - How does it work? - Look. Three cheers for the bride! Hip hip hurray! To its bouncing beat When bodies are as one A dance like no other ifs the Blue Java Together! İfs the Blue Java The greatest java of all That casts its spell And has coup/es dancing cheek to cheek To its bouncing beat When bodies are as one A dance like no other ifs the Blue Java She's beautiful like a star in the sky And her heart is filled with sunshine Tonight the village will be dancing In celebration of their wedding I'd like to go swimming with Agnés. - Swimming? What an idea! - Just for fun. Mother, / want to go to the dance I'll behave, I promise Mother, I'll behave, / promise Do you remember? Mother, do you remember? You met my father at a dance You met my father at a dance Please don't say no Please, Mother, be nice The weathers so nice I want to dance to the accordion's sound Let's hear it for the bride! - Shall we, Aunt Claire? - Yes, it will warm me up. Just follow me. Jean-Claude, a little music. Nana, I'm going to take your picture. All right. I'll raise my glass. It just takes ten seconds. It's funny to see them right away. Turn around, Raoul. Isn't that something? You took a good picture. Enough of that junk. I'm putting on Wagner. Can you open it? İf you steal any, I'll pound you good. My mother had a record player too. She played records all day. - Why didn't she keep you? - I don't know. She was always in bed, screaming. That story about your dad in Africa - you think I'm stupid? You may not care, but I'm not waiting for my ID card to find out where I was born. When I have the money, I'll go find out for myself. “Last name: Fournier. First name: Francois. Born: December 12, 1957. Admitted: July 1, 1961. Category: Temporary placement. File number: 7693. Religion: Baptized Catholic.” Nana's dead. Come, child. You mustn't stay in there. It's held together with staples, but it's still good and sturdy. Are you staying for lunch? - No, I have to go. Come by on Sunday for dinner. It's going to feel strange. Sure will. Well, bye. He's been swimming recently. He must have caught a cold. - For his school. - Thank you. - Keep him warm. - I will. How are you, my boy? Are you warm enough? There, a big kiss. You'll be nice and warm wrapped up like that. You'll be out running around again tomorrow. Do you like your Grandma? I know you do. You're a nice boy. You're a good patient. You're a big boy. Soon you'll be enjoying yourself out in the sunshine. Mrs. Thierry? Does Francois Fournier live here? - Yes. Has something happened? Please come down to the station as soon as you can. All right. Do you watch who he's hanging out with? Yes, / was called in to see the principal. At first I didn't know why. A schoolboy delivered a letter asking me to come in immediately. I thought to myself, “Francois has been naughty again." In the principal's office, he showed me a very long scout's knife. He asked whose it was. I told him it was mine. A child had left it with me as a souvenir, and I'd put it in a dining room drawer. He took it without me noticing. I'm so sorry about what's happened. He could have hurt one of his friends, because he's a very bad - No, not “bad.” You can't say that. But in a moment of anger, he could have hurt one of his classmates. In spite of everything, he has a good heart. - Has he stolen anything else? - Yes. Like what? All sorts of things. He gets up at night. Every day there's something else in his pockets. There's the little - Now I've forgotten. I have another boy who's in high school. He keeps all his school things in a briefcase in his room. - Raoul? - Yes. A few days ago I went to clean his room, and I was very surprised to find that briefcase empty. He just takes whatever catches his eye. And I have other children come crying to me that Francois stole their things. This can't go on. It's very unpleasant. There are always problems at school, and it really hurts sometimes. I raise him just like my other children, but he's still got this nasty habit of stealing. Is that all he does? Steal? He steals anything he wants. Recently he broke into our little girl's piggy bank that we put coins in now and then. And what for? To buy cigarettes, for all we know. He smokes at ten years old? You should see his friends! Nothing but a bunch of hooligans. He's always with those hoodlums from the projects. I can't follow him around all the time. I can't be constantly checking on him and his friends. We have nothing but problems with him. I'm constantly traveling to the agency to ask what I should do. We decide to send him back, but then we feel bad and end up keeping him. It's upsetting, because he's got a good heart. He's been crying for Nana ever since she died. “I miss Nana!” It really breaks your heart to hear him talk like that. He's a handful, but he's got a good heart. We just can't understand him. I think he's ill. Somethings wrong. You know, the way he talks about Nana - that really says it all. He's trying to cope with it. He's very sad about Nana. Come in. Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Thierry. Have a seat. What brings you here? We're here about Francois. You told us last time there was a chance he'd be back. But there's no sign of him, so I thought we'd come find out, because we're worried. Where is he now? Can we visit him? You know, the accident he caused was quite serious, so we've placed him in a center for observation. It all depends on how he behaves there. I hope we won't have to send him to a reform school. İf all goes well, we'll be in touch. Then you can decide if you want him back. How's Raoul doing? He ran away again, for two days. With that hard head of his, we can't find out where he was. - Stubborn as always, eh? - Yes. Come with me. What were you up to those two days? Answer me. I was at a friend's. Why did you do it? I hadn't written my essay. You ran away for two days for that? What happened? I ran into a teacher on my way to school, and I was too embarrassed to go to class. Is that all? You can tell me. I won't say anything. Look at me. Do you like living with the Thierrys? - Yes. There's nothing else you want to tell me? Look, sweetie. Francois sent us a letter. “Dear parents, I'm writing from the activities room. I've started making a bedside lamp for myself I really miss home and the town. I promise I'll be good until Christmas. That way I'll be able to come home for the holidays. All the teachers here are very nice, except for one, who can't stand me. I've made a friend. He's staying in Divion- I think about you every day. I send you all a big hug. Love and kisses, Francois. ”
