Rex: First he was, then he wasn'’t. Voorhas was born on a small hill during a great wave of heat and light. [Gears grinding] [Gears grinding] [Tires screeching] [Heavy metal music playing] Oh, shit!

We saw a ton of niggers, man. They were driving a marathon near the boulevard, right? So, uh... So, I yell, "go back up town, you spooks." So they all come for me from the car. "Fuck you, white meat." So, fucking lon starts chasing after them. They must have thought he had a gun '’cause they peeled the fuck outta there! So, lon and me, we'’re climbing the old yellow pass, right, just right there, we'’re circling around, right. Just as they'’re fucking below us, man, as they'’re below us, lon picks up this huge motherfucking hunk of brick, man, straight down the car! Boom! Unbelievable! There was shit all over the place, man. Boom is right, man. You'’re a savage, lon. All right! Hit me, hit me. God, you could never throw, man, you could never... Billy, where did you get this shit, man? This shit is Christ. From dirt, man. He'’s always got that good shit, man. They get it from the niggers, man. My boys always get it from the niggers and the niggers always got the best pot. Lon: Yeah, but why is that? Because they'’re niggers, man. Danny, give me a beer, man. Yo, where'’s your sister at, Billy? She went around the corner to puke. That fucking Amy always pukes. Let'’s get a game going here. Yeah!heads up, Danny. Going long! How you doing, Mrs. Kahn?Hey, Mrs. Kahn. Where'’s Amy? Uh, she'’s with my sister, Mrs. Khan. Oh. Billy, there'’s a new boy moved into number 9d. Oh, yeah? I think there'’s something wrong with him, I think he might be retarded. Listen, you tell Amy to get her ass home real soon '’cause I'm gonna have dinner ready. Hey, what are you making? I got crabs over at the fish store. Crabs?let'’s see, let's see. Oh, ugly suckers. How do you make those, Mrs. Khan? I Don'’t know. I got a recipe and a cookbook. You tell Amy. All right, let'’s go.

Got it. Got it. There you go, Mrs. Kahn. Oh, leave them there. I Don'’t want 'em. See the way they move? They was dancing like them Spanish cats. For a second, when I see them on the street, man, they looked like they belonged here and we didn'’t. They hate us, man. Look. [Crab legs rattling] What'’s in there? Lon: Amy'’s dinner. [Boys laughing]Oh, Don'’t talk about food. They'’re dead!No, they ain'’t. Look. Ah.amy: Ah! Stupid shit.Yo, we should cook them up. Yeah.bullshit. [Bin slamming] Oh, man!Guys, Don'’t do that. Have you got any more pot, bill? Billy: Yo, what happened to your joint, huh? It'’s full of puke. Vis: Oh, man, i'’m gonna go. [Boys laughing]You are so disgusting! Oh, god, I had to piss, Amy.

Amy: But you owe me a joint. Kate: That one'’s still good. It just has to dry. Lon: Are we gonna go play football or what? Yeah, yeah, li'’ll still play. Let's go. I'’m in.Yeah, me, too. You wanna score tomorrow?I Don'’t know, man. Right here. Come on. Give me the ball. Rex: The others had no memory, no past. They were awesome. Mutant angels dancing around sickly fires. Some had wings made of soft hair and couldn'’t fly. Others remembered things that never were, conjured up flames from their fingertips. Ulcerous dragons bragged oozing scales along the rubble. What was to eat? The night grew a horrible day. I run through their camp fire. It'’s me, it's me, it'’s me, it's me! [School bell ringing] [Indistinct chattering] Teacher: Hey! Hey, get off him! [Boy shouting] So you feebas faggots like the weed, huh? There'’s more coming in. Can we have a taste when it gets in? Hey, no taste, man. You know it'’s good. I was talking to you. You'’re talking to me now. Hey, dirt, is this guy the leader of the marathon crew or what? [School bell ringing] No, no, no, there is no leader. Anyway, it'’s my pot. You know, man, sometimes you can be a real asshole. What are you doing, man? It is my pot, you know. Sorry i'’m late, people. Larry, you can sit down now, if you'’re done discussing the world of high finance. Yeah, high finance is right. A keen wit you have, Larry. Now, even though you Don'’t have to, I would just like to remind you that you should be finished reading lord of the flies by next Monday. Because it is just possible you may get a test. I hate to introduce misery into your lives, but we must do these things. Yes, Mary. Mr. Ellsworth, we heard you'’re leaving osmo high. Yeah, I heard that, too.You'’re leaving? It is possible, god willing. Where are you going? I'’m going to donate my nervous system to science. [All laughing]No. It is possible that I will be take a sabbatical so that I can work on a book i'’ve started. What kind of book, a novel? Actually, it is a novel. Am I in it?Maybe, Larry, maybe. Now, the time has come that you'’ve all been waiting for, the osmo high poetry hour has begun. [All groaning]First of all, Ian. Who wrote leaves of grass? Frank morini?[Students laughing] Mary.walt Whitman. Very good. Somebody actually remembered that a whole week since we read it. Now, who wrote song of myself?Billy? Walt Whitman.[All chuckling] Right. That was a poem from the collection leaves of grass, so he and who wrote leave of grass? Boy: Frank morini.[All laughing] Now, as you recall on Friday you were asked to write a short poem of your own. Turd must'’ve wrote about his dick. Hey. Why Don'’t you be the first to come up here and read yours? I Don'’t got one. You Don'’t got one? Let me ask you a dumb question. Does anybody got one? Girl: Billy does.Bullshit. Kate told me you were writing one. She saw you. She'’s full of crap. Billy, do you have one? No.walt Whitman was a homo. [All chuckling]You'’re right. He was?Yes. You'’re learning despite yourself. All right, I have this brilliant idea. We are going to write poetry live, right here in the front of the class. Aw, come on.[All groaning] No, no, no, it'’s a great idea. Come on up here in front of the gang. For what? I didn'’t write one. Well, it doesn'’t matter. It doesn'’t matter. We'’re gonna wing it. Come on. This is what we'’re gonna do. Everybody'’s gonna get 20 seconds to just say whatever comes to your mind, just spit it out. Forget about rhyme or structure. Just express whatever you feel. Boy, is this stupid. No it'’s not. You people have a lot to say. This is your chance to let it out. There'’s nobody here but us. Come on, Billy, what do you think? I Don'’t know. Put yourself on the line. No, I can'’t do this.Sure you can. Five, four, three, two, one. Ready, go. Forget about it. You people have a lot...Excuse me, Mr. Ellsworth. This is your new student, Rex ormine. Come in, Rex. [Students giggling] [All chuckling] [Indistinct chattering] Rex has just moved into hellsbay. I'’m told that he is a writer of poetry. Which might be of interest, Mr. Ellsworth. Go sit there, Mr. Ormine. That'’s real great, Rex. We were just in the middle of a little poetry session. And maybe you'’d like to share some of your poems with us. No.bart: I'’m sure he'’d be happy to. Thank you, Dr. Waxman. See you later. I look forward to that, Mr. Ellsworth. Boy: Yeah, bye, Bart.[All chuckling] Hey, uh, ormine, who is your tailor? No, no. I'’ve been looking all over for a jacket like that. Larry, shut up. Now we are gonna continue this and see if anyone can have the balls... That'’s right, the balls to come up here and express themselves. How about you, Amy? Amy: I Don'’t got any balls. [All chuckling] Come on. You'’re a clever woman, you make good wise cracks, so we know you have something inside. Come on, try. Boy: Amy, Don'’t puke. [Guys chuckling]Give her a break. Come on. Just try to compose something. Something to the school. Boy: Compose this, Amy.A song to osmo high. Ian, you'’re a scumbag. Marathon fool. I said, give her a break. All right, just let it go. I'’ll give you five seconds. Five, four, three, two, one.Students: Three, two, one. Ready, go. [Boy groans] Osmo high. It'’s a drag.[Boys laughing] School'’s a drag because there are so many idiots in here. I Don'’t know. I can'’t do this. But you did do it. You said something. [Whooping] Osmo high is a drag! You felt it and you said it. That was very good. Osmo high is a drag, right? Right. But why is it a drag? Why do we feel that way? Because we gotta do this. '’cause we gotta do this. Ah, the honesty. Okay, come on. Now, let'’s keep it going. Amy pioneered it, let'’s take it further. Who'’s next? Come on, you guys. How about Rex? How about it, Rex? You follow what we'’re doing here? No. Well, we'’re just coming to the front of the class room and creating poems. Dr. Waxman said you write. Come on, Rex. All right, I will. Great. Just come to the front of the class here. The birds they sang, the night was chill. My tushy she feels the winter'’s chill. [All laughing]My tushy! Sunshine, honey bees... Mommy and daddy eat lots of trees. Wow, Rex. Hey, look, summer... Hey, look, it'’s summer... Hey, i'’ll kick your ass! [All exclaiming] Kick his ass! [Children talking indistinctly] Listen, man, we gotta get the iron skull tickets. They'’re gonna be sold out. Let'’s try to get them. You come with me, man. They'’re gonna sell out. I'’ll get the tickets. All right, yeah. Kate'’ll get them. That'’ll be Christ. Yo. What'’s up, man? Hey, Dougie. Kane.what'’s happening? Katie'’s gonna go up town and get us some iron skull tickets. Yeah, so give her your money. No, she ain'’t going. Why not? I said she ain'’t going, all right?Why? Look at how fucking shit-faced you are, man. What'’s your fucking problem? Hey, vis, man, what are you letting her drink for? Shouldn'’t she be in school or something? Vis: Billy, man, ease up. Into his fucking big brother stuff. One year. Hey, i'’m starving, all right? I haven'’t even got enough money for lunch, let alone iron skull tickets. So how do you have any? Daddy gave me some this morning. Oh, daddy gave you some. Yeah, right. Well, then give me some, all right? '’cause I gotta get something to eat. No. Kate, I swear to god i'’m gonna give you a fucking beating. All right, hey, man, just lay off, all right? Shut up, vis! Hey, you Don'’t talk to me like that, slut, all right? Hey, watch your fucking mouth, asshole! Cut the fucking shit. Someone get up town and get the tickets now. [Laughing] Oh, look at that retard over there. Man, that'’s some new kid. He is a twisted fucking dude. You should'’ve heard him. Hey. Hey! Little guy, man, what are you laughing at? [Laughs] Look at this brick head. His name is Rex. Hi, Rex.Rexie, man. Rexie. What'’s happening, baby? You having a good day or what? Huh?what'’s up, freak? My man is eating cream filled pastries. Rexie, now can I check out your pastries? You can check out his things, vis. You know that'’s a real nice shirt you got there. I'’ll kick your ass! I'’ll kick your ass! You'’ll do what, man? No. Hey, vis, he'’s gonna kick your ass. Oh, yeah. He'’s retarded.Let'’s go, man. I'’m retarded. No! I'’m radioactive. Come close to me. I think we'’re all radioactive mutants. This guy'’s nuts. That'’s it. Hey, forget about it, vis. He'’s just crazy. I'’m a crab. I'm a crab. You little shit. [Groans] Fucking retard, get lost. I'’ll kill you, motherfucker! [Groaning] Fuck'’s with you, man?'Vis! Stop it, man! Stop it! He'’s just nuts! No, man, he attacked me! Come on!It'’s dirt! What did he do now? Fucking dirtbag, he wrote shit on vis'’ tag on our pole last night. How do you know it was him? It'’s his style, man, marathon boy. Katie, i'’m gonna get the tickets. Dougie, come with me. I'’ll spot you the cash, okay? Me, too.Later. Tell me something, man. What are you into, huh? Beggar dreamed the dream of Kane of marijuana mothers sweet in the nose. In the morning and lunch. Eating and consuming what never was. Voracious consumption. All roads lead to lami laki sama. And the sad Princess in rags sings, "lami laki skock" lami laki sama. Let us contemplate the future as you contemplate the soil. [Students whooping] [Yelling] Bart: No. No, no, no, no, no. Nobody touch or straighten out your desks, please. Let'’s just stand by where you could be sitting. Before Dr. Waxman takes over I wanna suggest that anyone with information about the vandals can come and talk to me in private. Maybe some of you should forget about feebas Avenue and marathon boulevard. Think about your own behinds in this one. Stop by my office. Frank: All right. I want to apologize to you folks. There are some inconsiderate people who have left our class in this state. Now as some of you may recall, today we have the privilege of Dr. Waxman showing us all a thing or two. So, I relinquish the reigns of the class today to Dr. Waxman. Sir. Thank you, Mr. Ellsworth. I think it'’s a good idea to take a look around at what you or your neighbors have done. No, no, Ian, Ian, no sitting. Now let'’s just feel the discomfort this kind of thing causes to everyone. You know, it'’s funny but I think this is gonna fit in just fine with today'’s demonstration. Rex, what are you doing? Rex, nobody said you could do that. [Chairs shuffling]Please. See, I didn'’t give permission for anybody to sit. Well, you can certainly see how this disregard for your comfort affects you. You could not even remain standing for three minutes. Vandalism. It affects your lives negatively. Now, let'’s move on for a little demonstration which I call the wonderful world of sights and sounds. We all know that sights and sounds play a huge part of our every day. We associate one with the other. And together they form a whole picture or a concept. Now, for instance, look at this horse. This is just an ordinary horse, right? This is just a plain old horse, right? It'’s just a picture. Now, let'’s add a little bit of music to the picture.[Carnival music playing] Now, what do you see? A horse with a trombone up its ass. [All laughing] No one'’s impressed with that kind of talk. Come on, come on. Now, everyone, listen real close. [Whispers] This is top secret stuff. Now, do you see the picture of this man? What he does for a living can only be revealed through music. Foreign agents will find out if I just tell you. Listen to the music. [Surf rock music playing] And see if you can guess what he does. He'’s a shrink. He takes it up the heiny. [All laughing] Okay, fellows, fellows. You know, since you seem so interested in sights and sounds, we'’ll let you participate in the next experiment in front of the class. Come on, buddies. Up to the front, and take these whistles. Come on, up to the front.Rex: No. Come on, Rex, let'’s check it out. No. Don'’t be a baby. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. I'’m going. Okay, everyone. Everyone, now watch our two comedians. Here, you take these whistles. Now, watch. [Blowing hard] Not until I tell you to... [All laughing][Whistles blowing] Bart: I am not going to stand for this! Here I am without any sound. Just a sight. Now, look, what do you see? [Blowing] Now, now, I want you two to apologize to the class for wasting our time with that silly display after their time was wasted this morning by some other inconsiderate people. I said I want an apology. Come on, you'’re just wasting more of their time. Any of you neighbors want an apology? All: Yeah. All right. Give them their due. I'’m sorry. Rex, let'’s hear one! I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry Mr. Waxman is a lonely guy who sniffs his farts at night. [All laughing] All right. That'’s enough. Knock it off. I Don'’t wanna hear another sound. And you, sir, can sit down now. I think we'’ve had enough sights and sounds for today. Rex: ♪ the beat, the beat ♪ the beat, the beat ♪ the beat, the beat ♪ the beast, the beat ♪ the beat, the beat ♪ the beast, the beat ♪ the beat, the beat the beast lives underground, the sound. Can you hear the sound? Can you hear the sound? ♪ Of literate angels dancing around ♪ moon white black top... Hey! What are you doing, man? Where is everybody? Look, where'’s loni and Billy? Come on, retard. Come on, I gotta find '’em. I'’m not a retard. Okay, okay, I know, I know. Look, come on, man, there'’s trouble. Do you know where they'’re at? The holy playground. Moonlight black top holy playground. I'’ll take you there. Come on. What happened? Why are you here? Come on, hurry, man, hurry. [Panting] [Panting] Okay, five second to round four. Three, two, one. Ding. [Both grunting] Loni! Yo, loni! Loni, man! Hey. Dirtbag!look... What you doing here with that little runt? Hold up, fellows. I'’ll show you how to throw a punch on this faggot. Come on, loni. Sup with this retard? Hey, loni, i'’m not coming here for my health, man. My man cheespie, he just got shot by some niggers from uptown, man. Look, look. There was about two car loads of them. And this little motherfucker from the back seat shoots him, man. Bam! They said they was coming down to feebas next, man. So I ran down here. Is cheesepie dead, man? No.fuck, man, let '’em come. They'’ve got guns. Hey, did you guys do something, man? '’cause this is bad. Hey, we didn'’t do nothing to the brothers. They'’re full of shit. We'’re gonna make them pay, man. Scum bags. Vis: Let '’em come. [Twig snaps] What was that? What was what? I heard it, too. Around the river walk. Maybe they'’re back by the fountain. Shit, man. They'’re everywhere! Shut up! There'’s nothing there. All right, give it to me. All right, you pussies! Come on out and fight like men! Why Don'’t you show your faces, man? Come on, we can talk this out. Come on, man, we didn'’t do nothing to you bros. [Whispers] Show your faces, motherfuckers, show your fucking face. [Wings fluttering]Look out! [Gun firing] Hold it, hold it. Ain'’t coming here. I can'’t breathe. That was fucked up! Did lon shoot any of them? I Don'’t know, I couldn'’t tell. I Don'’t think so. Jesus Christ. Are there any around here? No, this place is cool. I was scared. You were scared? I peed in my pants. I was just waiting for a bullet to go through me, man. I can feel it. Me, too. I wonder how it feels. It'’s cool like wintergreen. Ask cheespie. I hate that, asshole. I'’m glad they shot him. So, Rex, what'’s wrong with you, man? You'’re always asking me that. "What'’s wrong with you? What are you in to?" Well, what are you into? I Don'’t know. It is cool like wintergreen. Hey, everyone calls me a retard. Hey, you'’re a weird motherfucker, man. [Chuckling] Billy: What a night, huh? This is unreal. Wonder where auggie got that gun. He got it from one of his homo friends. Here, rexi. You get high? Yes. But I Don'’t want any now. So, you live in the next building from us? Yeah, right in number 90. Which apartment? 2d. In the back. I can see into your bathroom through my window. Your father spends a lot of time in there. How do you know that'’s our father? That window has a board on it. Well, I can see his feet. See, the point is why do you look at it in the first place? It'’s the only window I have. So you live with your parents? No. Who do you live with? Well, a lady lives there. I think she'’s my mother. [Chuckles] What do you mean? It doesn'’t matter. Boy, you can really smell the river tonight. Yeah. It always reminds me of something. I Don'’t know what. I like the smell. It smells like... Like the beginning of things. Look at that glow in the sky. That'’s uptown, the city. No, no. Watch how those clouds pass through the glow. Watch. Oh, that is bizarre. Looks like an atomic bomb. Yeah, see... fuck, man. All melted and shit, you know. Like the Russians and us, like they nuke the piss out of each other. There'’s no past. Just us. The others destroyed the entire world. Altered creation. While most people were just trying to eat a meal or kiss a lover, or take a nap. Now, everything is very different. Very, very different. Lami laki sama. Cool. [Dog barking] You guys are giving me the creeps like I couldn'’t believe. Jesus Christ, this pot must be really strong. Let'’s get out of this park. Come on, wimp. I am not a wimp. You guys were just fucking with my head, all right? Billy: We'’re out of here. Voorhas, beggar, and the Princess begin their journey. [Girl laughing] No! Get out of there! What are you doing? Mr. Vis domini, I haven'’t seen you in school for a week. Is this why you come? You stopped me way before I could come. Just a moment, miss Kane. You, sir, keep marching right out of here. [Vis chuckling] And you, little girl, I really wanna tell you this. You have blossomed into a terrible little slut. Don'’t call me that. There, now go follow your boyfriend. I said Don'’t call me that. Leave, slut! You know, I could kill you. You couldn'’t hurt a fly. I hate you, you old whore! You ugly monster! I'’m gonna get you! Christ, i'’m gonna get you! [Hammering] [Drill whirring] Okay, there you go, ormine. Now you take the little saw and you trace right along the lines that i'’ve outlined there, okay? Hey, put down that box, you guys, for crying out loud! Can you believe that douchebag in there? How funny was that? Fuck you, vis. [Rex yelling] [Groans]Oh, my god. What happened, buddy?You need help. [Groaning]What happened, Rex? Sarah. Need we say more? No, we needn'’t. The omens do not fare well for your boy, frank. Listen, i'’m just trying to impress upon you that this kid Rex shows signs of being a very interesting student. You should hear some of the things he writes. In a lot of ways, he'’s miles beyond my normal students. I take him into therapy immediately. Will you calm down? You'’re making the kid feel like he needs a straight jacket, the way you act. Doctor, he needs special attention. It'’s that simple. Wrong, it'’s not that simple. That stuff'’s okay sometimes. But this guy just needs a chance to feel accepted in a normal classroom situation. Where do you come off making this kind of a judgment? By associating with human beings as human beings. It'’s the part of your practice you haven'’t read up to yet. It comes right after the table of contents. You want his mental health to be your responsibility? I want him to stay in my class. Hey, it'’s the retard. Shut up. Hey, Rex, what are you doing? How'’s your hand? Hi. It'’s okay. It'’s just my finger. Sure beat the shit outta that pretzel. Stupid thing. Hey, Rex, me and Dougie are going to the point to hang out and get high. Do you wanna hang? I'’m not gonna go, man. I'’m gonna crash. What'’s the point? Well, it'’s a point right out on the water. It'’s a good place to hang and get high at. Come on, me and you will go. Fuck Dougie. Let'’s blow this stupid place. There'’s nothing happening here. Yeah, let'’s blow this place. Maybe Kate'’ll come with us. Yeah, maybe she will. Billy: See, usually, you get a really cool view from here. The ocean'’s right over there. Rex: I can smell it. Mother ocean. Billy: Motherfucker. Kate: Give me another beer, Billy. Billy: It'’s like the end of the world here or something. Rex: I like it. Billy: Yeah, we come down here every once in a while, you know, it'’s a good place to hang and clean your head out. Holy shit! What is it? It'’s a shark. Look, it'’s a shark! Oh, yeah, a shark. Come on. It'’s a fucking shark, look! I bet it'’s jaws, huh. Oh, my god.Where? Right there. Holy shit, it is a shark! Hey, Rex, man, check this out. It'’s a shark. It ain'’t too big but that'’s a shark. Kate: What'’s it doing here? It'’s dying I think. Think of all the places it'’s been and it'’s dying right here. I Don'’t like it. We'’ve gone swimming here, too. Shit, man, look at it chomp on its jaw. Look at those teeth! Look, it'’s trying to bite the shit our of the air or something. What should we do? I feel sorry for it. What can we do? I Don'’t know. Get a stick or something. Look at its eyes. It'’s like he's looking right at us. Rex: The holy shark. Priestess should say a prayer. The fuck are you talking about now, man? Hey, he just wants you to say a prayer for the dying shark. Yeah, i'’ll say one, all right? Our shark who art in heaven... Hallowed by thy fin. Now, Kate'’s gotta say, "lami laki sama" to it. I Don'’t gotta say nothing. No, come on. It'’s very, very important. You Don'’t know how important it is. Look at that thing. You said you felt sorry for it. What has saying all this stupid stuff got to do with anything? No, you'’ll see. Come on, just say it. What is it? Billy, this guy is nuts. Hey, I Don'’t know. Lami laki sama. Come on, come on, please. Lami laki sama. How'’s that? It'’s beautiful. I love that. All right, so now what happens? I look like an asshole. Well, I mean besides that. No, that shows the shark that we'’re his brothers and respect him. Now his spirit can rest real good. Where do you get all this stuff? I Don'’t know. I just know it. Hey, where'’d the shark go? Holy shit! There it is. Just floated down there a little bit. Yeah, that was weird. Are you sure that'’s it? Yeah, must be. I think so. You guys wanna sit down? Yo, let'’s sit down over here. You wanna get high? I Don'’t know why I ask my little sister, the drug addict. You get high as much as me. You have enough pot for the concert? I'’m getting more before. Hey, Rex, you in the iron skulls? I think so. All right, i'’ll see if I can get you in with us. They are Christ at concert. I can'’t wait. Billy, man, he is really weird. Yeah, he is. But I like the dude. Don'’t you? I Don'’t know. Vis hates him. Everyone calls him a retard. Just look at him. [Seagulls cawing] He'’s cool. I can tell some people like him. He'’s just a little different, you know. You like him. Fuck vis, man. That'’s not why I Don'’t like him. I Don'’t give a shit what vis says, all right? I Don'’t know. Wouldn'’t it be a trip to get him high? I mean, it'’s just a trip to get high with him. Hey, Rex. What are you into, man? I was born right here. Right where? Right here. I remember that. It was bright hot just a little while ago. [Chuckles] He'’s great when you'’re stoned. No, no, listen, listen. I remember being born on that little hill. And then swimming right where the shark was dying. And then I was hungry, and I took a long walk over the hill on to a small dessert. From where I could see the burning, shimmering wreck of what must have been the great city. And so, I walked towards it. And I met people, the mutants. I met beggar, the priestess. Remember when we sat around the other night and watched the glow? Yeah. You know what i'’m talking about. I Don'’t. Am I the priestess? Yes. At first, I thought you were the Princess. But now I know that you'’re the priestess, too. He'’s the beggar?Mm-hmm. So, who are you? Voorhas! Yeah, they said that was your middle name. No, it'’s my real name. They Don'’t know shit. They'’re not even alive. You see, we'’re the only ones left. Us and a bunch of others. Everyone else killed themselves. Everything else is destroyed! Look around you. The shark knew that. See, those creatures built all these cities and things to their lunatic gods. They ignored the spirit of things, and worshiped dumb shit. And the cities were destroyed. Now they wanna destroy us, too, but we can'’t fall into their traps. We'’ve gotta know what's holy and how to use the magic around us. How to use each other. The prayer to the shark before was important. Didn'’t you feel a power when we looked at the shark? I felt something. See? Music is magic, too. Really important and strong. Use it, the beat.

They'’re already dead!They'’re already dead. So the main thing is they were never prepared for what would be spawned from the burnt out streets, and how we mutants could celebrate. They try and pull us down into their concrete graves but we'’re different now. It'’s too late. We'’re different. That'’s for sure, we are. Mutants, huh?Rex: Yeah. She'’s the beautiful and scary Princess priestess, who switches back and forth. And you'’re the beggar. What, a fucking beggar? No! The beggar. That'’s good!

We didn'’t touch the nigger. It was probably one of his brothers. Frank: All right, sit down, all of you. Put the gang stuff on hold during our class. I know you guys are all tough as hell, but do everybody a favor and keep the macho crap outside. Well, come on, louder. Look at Larry. He'’s so mad he forgot to get stoned for class today. All right. Alert pupils, who watched the pig head on the stake in the book you'’re supposed to have finished? Somebody besides Mary. Rex knows. Who else? Simon? Simon. Yes, siree. Simon the mystic. What do you think the pig represented to Simon? No?i Don'’t know. I mean, was it just a pig? It was like the devil. Kill the pig, spill her blood, bash her in. You'’re sick! That'’s what they sang, jerk. Ooh, the new class nerd. Hey, do something about it. All right. Enough of that. I got a poem. All right. Come up and read it, Rex. Larry: Dear grade, the retard has a retarded poem. Don'’t listen to him. Come on, Rex. Larry just doesn'’t have the nerve to come up here. Yeah, I ain'’t retarded. Shut up. Read it, Rex.Yeah, go ahead, Rex. What'’s the title of... Roachie squealed, crushed under heel. Rats watch quiet dare me to try it. Pigeons flap crusty with crap. And the mad dog snarls at a dream. Babies suck fruit from the truck. Squirrelies munch bones that go crunch. Kittens hoard hunks of the lord and the mad dog dreams of a stream. The mad dog sniffs. Grandpa stiff. Late at night dog dreamed fright. Crushed under heel old man squeal. The rat breeze, the smell of its death. The end. By voorhas. I think we are very impressed, Rex. [All clapping] Larry: Hey. Hey, could I try one? Sure.i know about roaches and rats. Larry, come up here. Come on! All right! All right.All right, i'’ll show you some poetry now. Every other teacher wants him out of their class. And I think it is bad judgment just because frank ellsworth wants to play Mr. Novak with him. I really must insist, I take him into therapy next week. Well, ellsworth is a good man. The kid is dangerous. But your point is well taken. You can start your sessions with him, but let'’s try to keep him in frank'’s class. Thank you, doctor. Hey, did you notice the pun that you could make out of that kids'’ middle and last names? You get it? "Your house or mine." [Kids screaming] [Heavy metal music playing] [Heavy metal music continues] [Boys yelling] Whoo! [All cheering] Singer: So how do you guys like t?

Look, you can'’t even feel anything, you'’re all looted out. Kate: Such an asshole. Look how crazy that got us. I could see the black head of death the whole concert. Everybody was feeling and breathing and praying to death. The skull. Kate: Death? Rex: The beauty of that since it was destroyed, it was attracted to anything that generates power. Anything with some feeling in it seems good to us. Even evil. It'’s good to be violent and pray to the death gods like the skulls. Because that'’s better than nothingness. But sometimes it'’s all we're left with. Billy: What else is there? Rex: Lami laki sama. The white truth. It'’s a celebration of mutant life, not mutant death. Billy: Voorhas, if you can get up there and show everyone sama, they'’d really go crazy. Crazy and drunk on our world, on what we have. We could do something like the skulls in the talent show maybe. Show everyone the streets of sound. It'’s right here. Only we can tame this, remember? '’cause we know its name. The beast we ride in. You are drum because you feel the beat.

Did you guys see the skulls in concert? Oh, they were Christ, man. Where were you guys? Billy, what are you talking to them for? '’cause we all live on the street. We should all be brother mutants against all other assholes. Not against each other. That'’s stupid. That'’s some heavy shit, dude. Yeah, but it'’s a fact, right? Who'’s gonna fuck with us when we'’re all together? Forget about it. And can you get inside of that, feebas and marathon united? Hey, it makes sense, man. No, I thought about it. It'’s weird.

You really think you'’re nuts? Sometimes. I'’m scared that I am. I'’m scared that... I Don'’t know. What? Sometimes I feel very far away. Talking from a tunnel. And i'’m fading. Or that... That everything around me is slowly fading. Melting away. Breath on a window until it'’s all gone except for me. All alone. God, I feel like that a lot. And the others, they... They try and scare me with their spells '’cause they know how it frightens me. They tell me i'’m crazy and they stick me in their dungeons. What do you mean, a loony bin or a hospital or something? No, a dungeon. Everyone talked just like waxman, but I could see right through them. It wasn'’t a nice place. I'’ll never go back there again because I think I know how to escape now. I know a new place. What do you mean? But I want to stay here with you, okay? I Don'’t want to be all alone with everything disappearing. It'’s not a nice thing to feel. It scares me, it makes me cry. You'’ll never be alone again. All right? '’cause the beggar and princess/priestess are right here. Hey. It'’s a holy kiss for my brother. Sama. Very sama. What you looking at, Larry?Huh? Nothing, man. So there'’s a surprise act signed up for the talent show on Thursday night. Miss santichi says that it sounds very fine and arty. Is that true or a rumor?It'’s true. Finish your test. I'’ll talk. And the rumor is that the name of the group is the mutants of sound. Is that true? Or a rumor?Yup. Finishing my test. But it is true. Mr. Ellsworth, what'’s a metaphor again? That'’s part of the test, Amy. Uh, who'’s puggy? That'’s a mistake. That'’s "piggy". Oh. I knew that. Rumor has it that I have some of the mutants of sound right here in this very class. Billy: Can you keep it down? I'’m trying to work. My mistake. I'’m sorry. Uppity show-biz guy. Okay. Time is up. Pencils, down, pass '’em up. Come on. Pencils down, pass '’em up front. Good, good. Okay. Now, tomorrow we have a poetry corner possibility if anyone is still interested. What do you say? Should we continue our series in great American poetry? All: Yes! All right. Okay. I might even have these marked tonight if i'’m not too lazy. [All chuckling] Amy, what did you get? I got an 80, man. What'’d you get? Eighty-five, baby. Hey, let me tell you, the results from this test were not too shabby at all. I am really proud of this class, really proud. I even read some of the essay answers from this class to some of my other groups they were so good. I actually enjoyed marking these tests, and let me tell you that was a first. [All chuckling] Some of the true-false sections were kind of interesting, too. What about the multiple choice? Larry, when you circled an e I was very moved. Larry: Thank you. All right, let'’s put all this test stuff away and have some fun. Let'’s get into the depths of human imagination. The osmo high poetry corner has begun. [All cheering] Now, who has some insight and verse to share with us? Woah, look at all the hands here. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Ian! Ian! All right. Come on up here, Ian. [All cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, Ian. Okay, here we go all right. School is school and cool is cool. But Friday night the iron skulls rule. All: Yeah! The skulls are so bad they rocked down the pad. And in the end the whole street was shaking like mad. The end. [All clapping] Frank: All right, Ian. That was great stuff. The ode to heavy metal. Especially, I liked the rhyme scheme in that. Da-da-dah, da-da-dah, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. It had like a Cadence of a rock song to it. A distinct beat. The beat, the beat.All: Ba-ba! Great. Okay, Billy, you had your hand raised. Do you have a poem? Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. William Kane. Rex: Beggar. I'’m nervous.All right. Just take a deep breath and go ahead and read.Beggar, beggar, beggar. All: Beggar, beggar. Billy, Billy, Billy. Let him read. To let go is strange to trust. I hallucinate. Beggar lives in a city of heat and darkness. He dances in the acid rain. I dreamt of a rope dog. Ropes not that whistled and twirled every time I left my sidewalk. To trust beggar hallucinates. In the endless day starts the night that'’s bright and telling as new. The dogs whistle and twirl. Running in circles on fire. Beggar, let'’s go. Lami laki sama. Billy. I always knew that there was more to William Kane than he wanted us to know. Wow. Rope snout that whistles. I want copies of all yours poems. I want to put a little book together, a literary magazine. I'’m so stunned and proud. Billy, before you sit down, would you read it again for us? We gotta go rehearse. I'’m really nervous about this thing. Me, too, and two more fucking days. It'’s gonna be cool as shit, though. Dougie'’s gonna meet us in an hour at our house. So you wanna just cruise around? Or we'’ll go on an adventure and ride hiss. Yeah. Rue the endless day. It might even be night now, we Don'’t know it. I forget. The whole sky is an orange moon. Kind of familiar things keep floating by. Is that a chair?Or is that an ice cream come? Hey, you fuck head! [Chuckling] How can a human being work here? Don'’t ask Bart. Frank, i'’m taking ormine to therapy during your class tomorrow. The hell you are.Oh, the hell, I am. Wait a minute. What'’s going on here? Nothing, frank. He'’s just gonna have ormine in for a little harmless talk. In my class. It'’s the only time I am available. Come on, Helen, i'’ll buy you a coke. Did the kids used to beat you up in gym class? I bet they did. I bet they did! Here comes waxman, bam, bam, bam! That'’s good, frank. Get it out! Now, that'’s enough, frank. Would you two leave us alone here? Frank, listen to me.What are you doing? It'’s not just Bart. We'’re all agreed that this crazy kid needs special care. "Crazy kid"? That kid is coming along. I understand. Now, listen, you listen to me, Mr. Ellsworth. I'’ve been around here for a while. There are times to be a rebel and times to take a loss and give in. I'’m not sure what your personal stake in ormine is, but we have got to face facts. Waxman is very well liked in the board of education. I Don'’t think that all of this is worth your losing your sabbatical over. I'’ve been stuck here for 40 years. Think about that. I had plans. You'’ve got plans. Take your shot. Don'’t mess it up for some petty politics. Hi.hi, Rex, how you doing? Good. Are you getting ready for the talent show tomorrow night? I think so. How come you'’re out here? [School bell ringing] Dr. Waxman wants to see you this period. It'’s not that big a deal. It'’s just one day. Probably just wants to have a little talk. Who knows, he might be interesting. Look, please, I hate him. Hey. Ain'’t you guys coming to class? Would go back inside? Please. Come on, now. You'’re late. He'’s not that bad a guy. Rex, you'’ll be back in class tomorrow. And i'’ll fill you in on anything you'’ve missed, I promise. Look, i'’ll see you later. You'’re not gonna leave my class for anything. I promise. I Don'’t wanna go. I Don'’t wanna go. I Don'’t wanna go. I Don'’t wanna go. I Don'’t wanna go. I Don'’t wanna go. I Don'’t wanna go. [Door closes] There he is. Hey, come in, buddy. Where you been? I'’ve been worried about you. I bet you guys are pretty excited about that talent show tomorrow night. I'’ll be there, you can bet on that. Come in, have a seat. Relax. Come on. Let'’s just get to know each other a little better. Hey, you sit there. Attaboy, have a seat. So... What'’d you have for lunch today? Shit. You Don'’t have to play tough with me. I'’m your buddy, okay, Rex? How'’s it going in hellsbay? Starting to feel like it'’s home? I'’m not crazy. I'’m not. No one said anything about crazy. I'’m your buddy, okay? A psychologist is someone who just talks to people about things that might be bothering them. Look, I was just talking to this young man who is ashamed because he had a lot of pimples. Where'’d you take that picture? That'’s not a painting. That'’s not a photograph. Do you like it? You know, it'’s very famous. Vincent Van gogh painted it. It'’s called starry night. So what?Does it interest you? Who took that photograph? It'’s a painting. Come on, I just told you that. It reminds me of you. Van gogh hates love. What are you writing down? Just things about our talk that... it just interests me. So, do you hate love, Rex? How do you like the girls here in hellsbay, huh? Why? Why? Do you like girls? Are they [sniffs] nice, and you know... Do you want to kiss them, asshole? Do you want to see me cry? If you feel like it, do you wanna cry? No. What are afraid of? There'’s nothing to be afraid of. No, no, no, no. That'’s it, Rex. Let it out. Let it out!You fucking evil shit! You evil shit! Shit that'’ll fade away. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! You wanna wrestle? Just write. And give me that picture. You want a copy of it? Yes, please. And you know who painted it? Lyndon Johnson. Lyndon Johnson? He'’s fucking dead!What do you know about lyndon Johnson? God damn it! Fuck! Max, why do you think you'’re so angry? Now, shouldn'’t you control it? I must control it. I must control it. I must control it. Tell me the spell. The spell? No. No, no, no. Don'’t tell me. Please don't. Am I done now? Can I leave? Well, what would happen if you stay here? No, no, look, please can I leave? I have to go, okay? I'’ll talk later, I swear. Please can I leave? Rex. Here. No, no, you Don'’t understand. I have to go! Please, please, please, please. Okay! Rex, okay! Okay, now listen to me, Rex. Okay, fine! Stop, okay? Now... [Screaming] No! Hey, get away from me! Rex! Rex, no. Look... hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop it, Rex. Come on. Don'’t rip the... that coat, that'’s an expensive London faux. So I shit in it. I blow my nose in it. Stop it! Stop it! Why can'’t you write this down? Control yourself! Come on! I'’ll get hold of the principal. Would you like that? Yes, please. Okay. Now, why Don'’t you go sit back down again? No! [Screaming] Fine, Rex! Okay, Don'’t start again please. Now, i'’ll try to get you a print of that painting. Douche.okay. Why Don'’t you go back to class now, Rex, and i'’ll see you later. All right, Rex? All right, pal? All right. That'’s my main man. [Ethereal music playing] [Ethereal music continues] Where'’s Mr. Ellsworth? Rex, some people from the hospital are here. I saw them. What are you doing in here, miss? Get back to your class immediately. I said immediately! Now! Now Rex ormine, you'’re to take your things and march down to the office. Rex, do you hear me? Young man, answer me when you'’re addressed. I have Mr. Ellsworth'’s class now. Mr. Ellsworth is absent. You are to report to Dr. Morningstone. This is Mr. Ellsworth'’s class. I have that now. Where'’s Mr. Ellsworth? He called in sick. I'’m taking over this class and we'’re having a study hall. Now, the rest of you take out some work and mind your own business. Mr. Ormine, march down to the office now. No, no, no, no. Well, i'’m sure they'll be happy to come up here. Rex, they'’re coming! Run, Rex! God, no!Come on, go!
