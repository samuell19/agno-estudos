TOKYO NEWCOMER Have a look, 1,000 yen for a tuna! Great bargain. Buy one, sir. Have a look. One thousand yen is cheap. How about another box? Boss, that kid is here. No. Stop! Don't run! Let me go! Hello, buddy. What happened? Why did you run? It's better to be careful. It's a no. The boss said you smiled like a child. Was I smiling? It was just an excuse. You should thank him for rejecting you. If you got this job, you won't be able to play Go. I've been carrying this for two months, and I haven't played one move. You're too straight-laced. I'll lend you some more money. I won't owe anyone money for Go. Don't be stubborn. I have to get back to work. Let's play a game when I'm free. Sure. Sorry. Oh, no. How did this happen? Thirteen, fourteen, each one is important. How did they get scattered in a place like this? Make sure to pick them all up. The marble stones look old. Are they made in China? Thank you for taking this bus. The next station is Namiki-Dori. Please wait for the doors to open. Let me help you. Let go. I don't need help. Since you got off as well... why don't we chat as we walk? Have you found work yet? I saw you reading the classifieds just now. It isn't easy to find work these days. If you don't mind doing the cleaning at a hotel, I can give you a referral. I have an old customer... whose hotel is looking for cleaning staff. Let me make a call. Mr. Taniyama? This is Igarashi. How are you doing? About the cleaning staff you were looking for... I just met a young Chinese man. Really? Thank you so much. Darn you! You're drunk! Mum? It's me. I found a job. Don't worry. I'm fine. We have to clean this side now. Here is some advice. No matter what the Japanese say, no matter how much you understand, you only have to say one thing. First nod, then say yes. This stool must be washed from the inside out. Yes! Why are you just standing there? Do you really not understand? Don't just stand there. Come with me. Boss. This is the new guy, Yoshiryu. Remember, young man, you're on probation for the first month. Probation. Do you understand? Never mind. Get back to work. Wait, you have to come with me to Reception. What a stubborn lad. This is the front door of the hotel. Make sure you clean it thoroughly. Don't miss a single hair or speck of dust. Yes. Let me do it. Ms. Naito, this is our new employee. My name is Yoshiryu. What is going on? I said I wanted a change of linen. Why are they still wrinkled after my bath? What is going on? I'm sorry, I'll change them right now. - I'll be back to inspect that. - Yes. Hey. Can you speak English? You haven't been in Japan for long, have you? I arrived in Tokyo not long ago. Can you speak English? Yes, of course. I just arrived in Tokyo. Dad, Mum... I miss you. What are you doing? It's dinner time, right? Dinner at home smells so good. Dinner is always a lively affair. I already ate. Really, I have. I want to eat... Mum's bean sprouts. The green kind. Please have some tea. What? This is... I heard that green bean sprouts are quite rare in Japan. It does appear so. I want to try making the dish with green peas. Have some tea first. Use whatever you need. Yes. Hello. Hello. I'm Shoichi. Her grandson. Who are you? My name is Yoshiryu. I'm Chinese. I'm a friend Ms. Igarashi just met. A friend? You're just a lost child, right? You got lucky, running into a kind-hearted old woman... much more than I am. I am her grandson, but as you can see, she has never been kind to me... despite me coming all this way to see her. I heard the villagers say... you are a Go genius. You passed by Kinshicho Station on the way here, right? I work at the bowling alley there. Bowling? Bowling, you understand? I have to go. Good luck. Come to the bowling alley if you have time. You'll make a lot of friends there. It smells so bad. This is disgusting. Hey, looking good. I'm sure Satoshi will win at the next championship. I've got enough bronze medals. Will you come and watch me? We'll see. Of course. Shoichi will come. Wait, not like that. Bowl from the side. He only ever teaches Nanako. Shoichi, do something. Satoshi. Keep your hands off Nanako. Scary. You came. Who is this? He's so handsome. Is he Chinese? I don't know. Go and have fun. I'll introduce you to some friends. Nanako? She has work. She's a beautician and has to go to work early. She's a remarkable woman. She's from Taiwan. Be quiet! What did you say, jerk? You're drunk. Stay at my place tonight. I'm not going to your place. It must be a dump. Let's keep drinking. Don't you want to drink with me anymore? Let's drink till morning... since Nanako's not here. I want to go to Nanako's... Nanako! I'm sorry... Kimie? Did you bring the pickled radish? Yes, I have. Lower Itabashi's Granny Sakashita sent a message. I see. Come now, Yoshiryu. There's still another bag here. Here's a Chinese saying for you. Do your own work. Good morning. Everyone is here. Announcement. Yoshiryu, please go to Reception. Yoshiryu, they are from a Chinese publishing firm. Nice to meet you. We are reporters from Overseas Chinese Weekly. Hello, I'm Li. We would like to interview you regarding your Go studies and life in Japan. There isn't much to say. I just arrived in Tokyo. An interview? Don't you know? He's a Go expert. Go? You play Go? Amazing. Do you know about our regular client, Umetsu? He is a great Go player too. Sorry to interrupt. Welcome. Should we find a place to sit down and talk? Would you like a room? Have you been playing Go a lot in Japan, Yoshiryu? Yes, with myself, all the time. We also came to tell you about the Go tournament on TV. Who is it? Yoshiryu. Yoshiryu. Open the door. Shoichi. Open the door. Open the door. Close it. Close the door. What's going on? I was attacked in Nanako's beauty parlour. You need to go to the hospital. I can't. Yoshiryu, open the door. What are you doing? I'm tired from work today. I was just going to sleep. It's all in the mind. I made bone soup. Come and have some. You enjoy it. I'm going to bed. Yoshiryu. Are you all right? I need a pen and paper. Wait. I killed someone. Killed someone? Good morning. You're early, Yoshiryu. Come in. Have you had breakfast? What's wrong? Shoichi... He's finally asking for the money. His father saved this money... for his future. I'm sorry to have troubled you, Yoshiryu. Let him be. Every person... has his own path to follow. You're home. This is from Ms. Igarashi. She told me to give this to you. What else did she say? Listen to it yourself. Yoshiryu. Let me teach you... some proper Japanese. Don't be nervous. Just say it the same way I taught you. Hello? Please don't say anything first. Listen to me. Shoichi is with me. He is badly hurt. - Don't speak Chinese. - Go to Omori Station at 7 p.m. tomorrow. Stop asking. I'll wait there for you. What did you just say? You talk too much. I heard you're a great Go player. How about a game? I got leave for you from your boss. I give up. You are amazing. Hello? It's me. I'm sorry, I'm late. Where are you? I'm nearby. Shoichi can't come. He told me to give you a bank card. I'll put it in the phone book in this phone booth. I won't take that money. Take him to the hospital to get treatment as soon as possible. That's what I told him, but he said he couldn't go to the hospital. He... Then get him medicine for his injuries. Then use that money to help him escape overseas. Do you understand? I do. But I hope you can talk to him face to face. You're the only one who can help him now. Hello? Hello? You wanted to see me, Yoshiryu? I'd like to ask you a favour. A friend of mine is hurt. Is it serious? He won't go to the hospital. Could you please buy this Chinese medicine for me? It might be hard. It'll be even harder for me. All right. I'll try. Thank you. Try this. Don't laugh at me. I was trying to make Chinese dumplings. This year's Kanto Go Championship is more popular than ever. The finals will take place at Nihon Ki-In, and it will be broadcasted live. The championship is open to all. For more details, please contact the organisers. Give me the lease for the shop now! No, Nanako! Nanako! Get out! Stop! Scumbags! Blast you! Scumbag! Curse you! Go to hell! See this? Run, Nanako! Nanako... goodbye. Good morning. Good morning to you too. Good morning. Good morning. Seasonal vegetables. Yes, freshly dug from the mountain. It's so fresh. The 23rd Kanto Amateur Go Tournament will begin on May 28, two days from now. The preliminary round will be held on the 28th and 29th... Kimie. at the Nihon Ki-in headquarters at 10 a.m. Excuse me. Are you Ms. Igarashi? My name is Nanako. I am Shoichi's girlfriend. Shoichi is badly hurt. Do you know about this? His life may be in danger. Please convince him to get treated. Ms. Igarashi! Are you just going to let him die? No one can save him. No one but himself. And here as well... I think there are Japanese like this. Stands like a peony, sits like a tree peony, walks like a lily. Do the Chinese characters mean anything to you? Yes, somewhat. There is also this idiom. Flowers in both hands. Both hands... flowers? What if you have beauty in each hand? Beauty? Big drums. I heard there's a village ritual next week. Yes. Times have changed. We used to attend the ritual happily... as a family of three. Those days are long gone. Family of three? Who else was there? Let me carry the vegetables that you'll sell in Tokyo tomorrow. No way. I told you I don't need help. I can't let you do this. Consider it a job for me. Please. Silly boy. Are you trying to make it hard for me? Yoshiryu... is Shoichi staying with you? Shoichi has taught me a lot. Has my Japanese improved? Tell him... Chiba's family still takes the family name of Igarashi. Hey! Shoichi! Good! Again! Stands like a peony... I stand like a peony? Sits like a tree peony... Tree peony? What? Tree peony! Walks like a lily. What flower am I? A rose. Amazing. Yoshiryu. Yoshiryu. Are you awake? I can't sleep. Let's do something. You play Go, right? Go? Go ahead. Shoichi, you play like a friend of mine. He plays very well. His name is Liu Ji. Liu Ji? If you say it backwards, it sounds like my name. People often confuse us. Nosebleed? Are you all right? I'm fine. This happens a lot. When did you learn to play Go? I already forgot how to play. Forget it. Forget Go. Yoshiryu, I want to ask you a favour. Darn you. The water is up there. Go, Satoshi! Stay calm. Do your best. - Go. - Go, Satoshi! Keep your cool. Tell Shoichi to go now. They're coming. You jerk! Liar! Pervert! What do you want? Get out of my way! How dare you stand here. Get out! It's him! After him! Stop right there! You rat! Get out! Go! Shoichi! Please. Come with me to a hospital in the countryside. Shoichi. You jerk! I can't be with you anymore. Goodbye. Are you all right? I've never seen anyone... as stubborn as him. Please take care of him. Here you go... Good evening. Ms. Igarashi. I got into the second round. Shoichi confirmed it for me. Yoshiryu got first place in his group. This is worth celebrating. The village ritual is also today. - Cheers. - Cheers. Nice. We are going then. Your grandson is here too. The flowers growing there Have all turned into gold And everywhere The dream of spring unfolds... The door is unlocked. Are you giving me Chinese medicine again? Ms. Igarashi said she is taking you to the hospital tomorrow. Don't worry. I know how I am doing. I'll talk to her. Don't say anything stupid. I won't. Go... I heard you. In the field of rape flowers The flowers growing there Have all turned to gold On the mountainside And everywhere The dream of spring unfolds When the sun Begins to paint the sky... We confirmed it on the Internet last night. He is a professional player. No, it's a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding. But his information is online. We have interviewed him before. I can prove he isn't a professional player. I'm late. There's no time. Go inside first. Please take him inside. Hurry. Six point five compensation points from the Black player. Game time is 60 minutes. Begin now. Pleased to play against you. - Please explain it to him. - Yes. - I'm very sorry. - Yes. Well played, Yoshiryu. Congratulations. I must notify you of something. You know, this is an amateur competition. The organisers said you already have a professional status... in the country. We are very sorry. As the organisers, we did not wish for this to happen. But there are governing regulations. We cannot change the rules. You are a good Go player with great talent. We recognise that. If I lost that game just now, this wouldn't have happened. Don't be angry. Do you want me to explain anything to them? I can explain it myself. I am not a professional player. They've made a mistake. - Please explain it to them. - Yes. There is a professional player called Liu Ji. Their names get confused all the time. Yoshiryu, please change the linen in no. 508. Chairman Kato, it's Shoichi. Hello. Yes, it's Igarashi Shoichi. Grandma is fine. Thanks for asking. We live together now. Yes. I'd like to ask you a favour. A Chinese friend of yours... has taken part in the Go championship currently in progress. He should have been in the finals, but the organisers believe he is a professional player... and disqualified him. This is all a misunderstanding. He is not a professional player. I know. Yes, that's it. I heard that you are resigning. Why? My probation period is over. I don't want to stay. Why have you been avoiding me? Have I? I know why. He has nothing to do with you and nothing to do with me. It doesn't matter. I don't understand. You are both men. Why are you so different? Please tell me. I am Chinese. Yoshiryu... Please come to Reception. You have a phone call. Goodbye. Chairman Kato. I'll ask Grandma to speak to you. Could you help us out? Yes. Thank you. How are you doing? Quite well. How is he? He is fine. He is back in Chiba. Chiba? What for? Can he get treated there? I've already run this far. What is he afraid of? Dragging you down. You should talk to him. It's no use. He thinks this is love. I wouldn't be here otherwise. You know him better. He's stubborn. It's this stubbornness that will kill him. Perhaps it's this stubbornness that made us friends... even if he can be a jerk when he's stubborn. Do you really want to die? Do you think he'll change his mind... if I jump off from here? No, absolutely not. Yoshiryu... I may not get into the finals. We are approaching the finals of the 23rd Kanto Amateur Go Championship. Natori Hideki from Suginami, Tokyo, and Chinese student Yoshiryu will be playing against each other. The finals will take place in Chiba... Congratulations. Do your best! We must celebrate properly. Oh, the bean sprouts are overcooked. Please enjoy the tempura. I haven't watched a Go tournament in many years. This time, I want to see you play on TV. Where did you learn to play, Yoshiryu? People from my hometown like to play. I learned it as a child. Can you play, Ms. Igarashi? Hello, Igarashi residence. It's all right. I'm fine. I'm much better. No. That won't do. I don't need the money. You have to reopen your beauty parlour. Don't worry about me. I talked to Dr. Sakaguchi in Nagano. You'll be safe there. When the Go competition is over tomorrow, I want to make a trip back home. The finals is about to start. In today's competition, we have our first overseas student. Yoshiryu from China takes the top spot in the finals with his outstanding performance. Please. I have been watching his games. He's a really talented player. On the White side is our defending champion, a strong amateur player, Mr. Natori Hideki. Sir, the game is about to start. Yoshiryu has the first hand on the Black side. The game begins. The white stone is at the back. Hideki doesn't seem concerned with that side and is playing on the other side. However, the black stones are focused on the offence here. Yes, while the white stones are working on this side. The black stones have firm control of these two corners. The white stones are gaining strength on the side. The game continues in the standoff between the black and white stones. It appears that the black stones will take up a large portion of this side while the white stones are strong on the other side. This is a large area as well. This will be an exciting game. Yoshiryu plays... a lot like Father. Grandma. You went to see Chairman Kato... so Yoshiryu could play, didn't you? Shoichi. Before your father died, he told me... that you would play again... one day. I'm sorry. Shoichi! I lost. Ms. Igarashi. You're here. I didn't play well. Shoichi... played this move for you. Shoichi? Where is Shoichi? I sent him back... to Nagano yesterday to get treatment. Incredible. Yoshiryu, let's finish the game from the finals. The villagers will see me off tomorrow. Let's play a game to thank them. How about you take the Black side? Let's set up the stones. Let's begin. I won by five stones, right? Thank you, Ms. Igarashi. Thank you for looking out for me. Take care. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks again. Take care of yourself. Thanks. These are Shoichi's ashes. In here is a portion of it. Grandma. Stay strong. Thank you. Kimie. Take care. Take care. Thank you for everything. Thank you. Thank you so much for everything. Take care of yourself. We won't forget you. Come back anytime. Goodbye, Kimie! Take care, Ms. Igarashi! Do you know where Shoichi went? Didn't Ms. Igarashi tell you? He went to the countryside to get treatment. He is in heaven. That year, Ms. Igarashi went from Nagano to Chiba to marry Shoichi's grandfather in a union of two families of famous Go players. It was a spectacular wedding. Almost all the Go elites in Japan were there. Under their cultivation, Shoichi's father became a Go master in Japan. Unfortunately, soon after the death of Shoichi's grandfather, Shoichi's father also died in a car accident. Ms. Igarashi raised Shoichi by herself and taught him everything about Go. When he was 12, he even won the Newcomer's Championship. However, after Shoichi graduated from high school, he suddenly hated Go... and went to Tokyo alone. Without Go, Shoichi seemed to have lost his dreams. When I first saw Ms. Igarashi... I knew... from my female instincts that she is even more stubborn than Shoichi. You gave up too soon, coward. Playing Go is like pursuing a girl. Don't give up so easily. Do your best. Jerk. Hello, Ms. Igarashi. Hello. Here's a letter for you. Thank you. To Kimie Igarashi You are in good shape today. I lost. You played brilliantly too, Mr. Natori... especially in laying down formations. Father, this is Mr. Yoshiryu. He's from China. Nice to meet you, Mr. Yoshiryu. Nice to meet you, Chairman Natori. My son has mentioned you quite a few times. He said you're a Go genius. Why don't you come and work for me? You can work and play Go at the same time. Thank you very much... but that might not be in my plans right now. Hello, miss. Hello. Yoshiryu from Intermediate Class 2, please come to the reception area. There is a call for you. The holidays are coming up. Are you going home? Yes. I'm taking Japan Airlines. I heard it's quite cheap. Hello? Ms. Igarashi. How are you? I just finished class. Nihon Ki-in? Scholarship? An interview? Thank you very much. Sorry to bother you. Are you Master Igarashi? It's really you! I am a long-time fan of yours. It's been so many years. Your husband played so well. How are you, Yoshiryu? How about you, Ms. Igarashi? Good, thanks for asking. This notification letter... reached me way later after multiple detours. Thank you for looking out for me. Ms. Igarashi, you have made me much stronger. It's a shame Shoichi couldn't come... but he's wishing you the best from back home. Go on. The teachers from the school are waiting. Put your heart into every move. Keep it up, Ms. Igarashi! It's Master Igarashi... Translated by: SDI Media
