- It seems to me, that when God conceived the world; that was poetry. He formed it; that was sculpture. He varied and colored it, and that was painting. And then, crowning all, he peopled it with living beings, and that was the beginning of the grand divine, eternal drama. Dr. Thomas Edward Poag. - Caesar, Caesar, Caesar! Caesar, Caesar, Caesar! Caesar, Caesar, Caesar! Caesar, Caesar, Caesar! Caesar, Caesar, Caesar! Caesar, Caesar, Caesar! Caesar, Caesar, Caesar! - Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home! Is this a holiday? What? Know you not, being mechanical, you ought not walk upon a laboring day without the sign of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou? - Why, sir, a carpenter. - Where is thy leather apron and thy rule? What dost thou with thy best apparel on? You, sir; what trade are you? - Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler. - But what trade art thou? Answer me directly. - A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe conscience, sir, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles. - What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade? - Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you. - What mean'st thou by that? Mend me? Thou saucy fellow! - Why, sir, cobble you. - Thou art a cobbler, art thou? - Truly, ma'am, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl. I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I re-cover them. - But wherefore art not in thy shop today? Why dost thou lead these men about the streets? - Truly, ma'am, to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work. - Yeah! But indeed, ma'am, we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph. - Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home? You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things! Be gone! - Go, go, good countrymen. Go, go. See whether their basest metal be not moved; they vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness. Go you down that way towards the capitol; this way will I. Disrobe the images where you find them deck'd with ceremonies. - May we do so? You know it is the feast of Lupercal. - It is no matter; let no images be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets; so do you too, where you perceive them thick. These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch, who else would soar above the view of men, and keep us all in servile fearfulness. - Calpurnia-- - Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. - Calpurnia-- - Here, my lord. - Stand you in Antonius' way when he doth run his course. Antonius. - Caesar, my lord? - Forget not in your speed, Antonius, to touch Calpurnia; for our elders say, the barren, touched in this holy chase, shake off their sterile curse. - I shall remember. When Caesar says do this it is performed. - Set on, and leave no ceremony out! - Caesar! - Hark, who calls? - Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again! - Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, cry Caesar! Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear. - Beware the Ides of March. - What woman is that? - A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March. - Set her before me; let me see her face. - Woman, come from the throng; look upon Caesar. - What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again. - Beware the Ides of March. - She is a dreamer; let us leave her. Pass. - Will you go see the order of the chase? - Not I. - I pray you, do. - I am not gamesome; I do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires; I'll leave you. - Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you. - Cassius, be not deceived. If I have veil'd my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself. Vexed I am of late with passions of some difference, conceptions only proper to myself, which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors; but let not therefore my good friends be grieved, among which number, Cassius, be you one, nor construe any further my neglect, than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, forgets the shows of love to other men. - Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion; by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? - No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself but by reflection, by some other thing. - Aye 'tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye, that you might see your shadow. I have heard where many of the best respect in Rome, except immortal Caesar. Speaking of Brutus, and groaning underneath this age's yoke, have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes. - Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me? - Good Brutus, be prepared to hear; and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection, I, your glass, will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of. - What means this shouting? I do believe the people choose Caesar for their king. - Aye, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. - I would not, Cassius. Yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? That be ought toward the general good set honor in one eye and death in the other and I will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as I love the name honor more than I fear death. - I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, as well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you. We both have fed as well; and we can both endure the winter's cold as well as he. He had a fever when he was in Spain; and when the fit was on him I did mark how he did shake, 'tis true, 'tis true, this god did shake. As colored lips did from their color fly. And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Aye, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans mark him, and write his speeches in their books, alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius," as a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me, a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world, and bear the palm alone. - Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar. - Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus; and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves that we are underlings. Brutus and Caesar, what should be in that Caesar? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with them, Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar. Now, in the names of all the gods at once, upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed that he is grown so great? When could they say, til now, that talk'd of Rome, that her wide walls encompass'd but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough, when there is in it but one only man. O, you and I have heard our fathers say there was a Brutus once that would have brook'd th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome, aye as easily... As easily as a king! - That you do love me, I am nothing jealous; what you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter; for this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, be any further moved. What you have said, I will consider; what you have to say, I will with patience hear; and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things. Until then, my noble friend, chew upon this. Brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of Rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us. - I am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. - The games are done, and Caesar returns - As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve; and he will, after his sour fashion, tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today. - I will do so. - Did you pull me by the cloak? Would you speak with me? - Aye, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today, that Caesar looks so sad. - Why, you were with him, were you not? - I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. - Why, there was a crown offer'd him; and being offer'd him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting. - What was the second noise for? - Why, for that too. - They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? - Why, for that too. - Was the crown offer'd him thrice? - Aye, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted. - Who offer'd him the crown? - Why, Antony. - Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. - I can as well be hang'd, as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put it by once. But, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again. Then he put it by again. But, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as he refused it, the rabblement shouted, and clapp'd their chopt hands, and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown, that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. - But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? - He fell down in the market-place, and foam'd at mouth, and was speechless. - 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness. - No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I, and honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. - I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. - What said he when he came unto himself? - Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he pluck'd me ope his doublet, and offered them his throat to cut, and I had been a many of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. So he fell, when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. - Did Cicero say anything? - Aye, he spoke Greek. - To what effect? - Man I tell you that I'll never look you in the face again? But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part it was Greek to me. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. - Will you sup wit me tonight, Casca? - No, I am promised forth. - Will you dine with me tomorrow? - Aye, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. - Good; I will expect you. - Do so; farewell both. - What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. - So is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise, however he puts on this tardy form. - And so it is. For now I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, come home to me, and I will wait for you. - I will do so. Til then, think of the world. Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see, thy honorable metal may be wrought, from that it is disposed. Therefore 'tis meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes; for who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus; if I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, he should not humor me. I will this night, in several hands, in at his windows throw, as if they came from several citizens, writings all tending to the great opinion that Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at. And after this let Caesar seat him sure; for we will shake him, or worse days endure. Who's there? - A Roman. - Casca, by your voice. - Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this! - A very pleasing night to honest men. - Who ever knew the heavens menace so? - Those that have known the earth so full of faults. For my part, I have walk'd about the streets, submitting me unto the perilous night; and, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see, have bared my bosom to the thunderstone; and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open the breast of heaven, I did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it. - But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? It is the part of men to fear and tremble, when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us. - You are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life that should be in a Roman you do want, or else you use not. You look pale and gaze, and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder, to see the strange impatience of the heavens. But if you would consider the true cause why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, why all these things change from their ordinance, their natures, and preformed faculties to monstrous quality. Why, you shall find that Heaven hath infused them with these spirits, to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state. Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man most like this dreadful night; a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action; yet prodigious grown, and fearful, as these strange eruptions are. - 'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius? - Let it be who it is. For Romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors; but, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead, and we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits. - Indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish Caesar as a king; and he shall wear his crown by sea and land, in every place save here in Italy. - I know where I will wear this dagger then; Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius. Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat. For life, being weary of these worldly bars, never lacks power to dismiss itself. If I know this, know all the world besides, that part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure. - So can I. So every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity. - And why should Caesar be a tyrant then? Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf, but that he sees the Romans are but sheep. He were no lion, were not the Romans hinds. But, O grief. Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this to a willing bondman. Then I know my answer must be made; but I am arm'd, and dangers are to me indifferent. - You speak to Casca; and to such a man that is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand. And I will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest. - There's a bargain made. Now know you, Casca, I have moved already some certain of the noblest-minded Romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable-dangerous consequence; and I do know by this, they stay for me in Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night, is favor'd like the work we have in hand, most bloody, fiery, and most dangerous. - Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste. - 'Tis Cinna; I do know her by her gait; she is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so? - To find out you. Who's that? Metellus, Cimber? - No, it is Casca, one incorporate to our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna? - I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this! - Am I not stay'd for? Tell me. - Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could but win the noble Brutus to our party-- - Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper, and look you lay it in the praetor's chair, where Brutus may but find it; and throw this in at his window; set this up with wax upon old Brutus' statue. All this done, repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us. Is Decius, Brutus, and Trebonius there? - All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone to seek you at your house. Well, I will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me. - That done, repair to Pompey's theater. Come, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day, see Brutus at his house. Three parts of him is ours already; and the man entire, upon the next encounter, yields him ours. - O, he sits high in all the people's hearts! And that which would appear offense in us, his countenance, like richest alchemy, will change to virtue and to worthiness. - Him, and his worth, and our great need of him, you have right well conceited. Let us go, for it is after midnight; and, ere day, we will awake him, and be sure of him. - What, Lucius, ho! I cannot, by the progress of the stars, give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say! I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly. When, Lucius, when! Awake, I say! What, Lucius! - Call'd you, my lord? - Get me a taper in my study, Lucius. When it is lighted, come and call me here. - I will, my lord. - It must be by his death. And, for my part, I know no personal cause to spurn at him, but for the general. He would be crown'd. How that might change his nature, there's the question. It is the bright day that brings forth the adder; and that craves wary walking. Crown him? That, and then, I grant, we put a sting in him, that at his will he may do danger with. Th' abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections sway'd more than his reason. But 'tis a common proof, that lowliness is young ambition's ladder, whereto the climber-upward turns his face; but, when he once attains the upmost round, he then unto the ladder turns his back, looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend. So Caesar may; fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented, would run to these and these extremities. And therefore think him as a serpent's egg and kill him in the shell. - The taper burneth in your closet, sir. Searching the window for a flint I found this letter thus seal'd up, and I am sure it did not lie there when I went to bed. - Get you to bed again; it is not day. Is not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March? - I know not, sir. - Look in the calendar, and bring me word. - I will, sir. - The exhalations, whizzing in the air give so much light that I may read by them. Brutus, thou sleep'st. Awake and see thyself. Shall Rome et cetera? Speak, strike, redress! Brutus, thou sleep'st. Shall Rome, et cetera? Thus must I piece it out. Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? Rome, what? My ancestors did from the streets of Rome the Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king. Speak, strike, redress! Am I entreated, then, to speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise, if the redress will follow, thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of Brutus! - March has wasted 15 days, sir. - 'Tis good. Go to the door, somebody knocks. Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept. Between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion, all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream. The genius and the mortal instruments are then in council; and the state of man, like to a little kingdom, suffers then the nature of an insurrection. - Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door, who doth desire to see you. - Is he alone? - No, there are more with him. - Do you know them? - No, sir, their hats are pluck'd against their ears, and half their faces are buried in their cloaks, that by no means I may discover them. - Let 'em enter. They are the faction. O conspiracy, shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, when evils are most free? O, then, by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy; hide it in smiles and affability. - I think we are too bold upon your rest. Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you? - I have been up this hour, awake all night. Know I this lot that come along with you? - Yes, every one of them; and no one here ut honors you; and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble Roman bears of you. This is Trebonius. - He is welcome hither. - This Decius Brutus. - He is welcome too. - This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber. - They are all welcome. What watchful cares interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night? Hmm, give me your hands all over, one by one. - And let us swear our resolution. - No, not an oath. If not the face of men, the sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse. If these be motives weak, break off betimes, and every one hence to their idle bed; so let high-sighted tyranny range on, 'til each man drop by lottery. What need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress? What other oath than honesty to honesty engaged, that this shall be, or we will fall for it? But do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise, nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits, to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath. - Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar? - Only Caesar. - Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet, Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him a shrewd contriver; and you know his means, if he improve them, may well stretch so far as to annoy us all. Which to prevent, let Antony and Caesar fall together. - Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, to cut the head off, and then hack the limbs, for Antony is but a limb of Caesar. Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. - Yet I do fear him; for in th' ingrafted love he bears to Caesar-- - No, no, there is no fear in him; let him not die; for he will live, and laugh at this hereafter. - Peace, count the clock. - The clock hath stricken three. - 'Tis time to part. - But it is doubtful yet whether Caesar will come forth today or no; for he is superstitious grown of late. It may be the persuasion of his oracles may hold him from the capitol today. - Never fear that. If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him. Let me work; for I can give his humor the true bent, and I will bring him to the capitol. - Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him. - By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost? - Be that the uttermost; and fail not. - The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus; and, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember what you have said, and show yourselves true Romans. - My good comrades, look fresh and merrily; let not our looks put on our purposes, but bear it as our Roman actors do, with untired spirits and formal constancy. And so, good morrow, everyone. - Brutus, my lord! - Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now? It is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw-cold morning. - Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus, stole from my bed, and yesternight, at supper, you suddenly arose, and walk'd about, musing and sighing, with your arms across; and, when I ask'd you what the matter was, you stared upon me with ungentle looks. It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep; and, could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevail'd on your condition, I should not know you, Brutus. Good my lord, make me acquainted with your cause of grief. - I am not well in health, and that is all. - Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health, he would embrace the means to come by it. - Why, so I do. Gentle Portia, go to bed. - No, my Brutus; you have some sick offense within your mind, which, by the right and virtue of my place, I ought to know of. And, upon my knees, I charge you, by that great vow which did incorporate and make us one, that you unfold to me, yourself, your half, why you are heavy, and what men tonight have had resort to you; for here have been some six or seven, which did hide their faces even from darkness. - Kneel not, gentle Portia. - I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus. Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, is it excepted I should know no secrets that appertain to you? Am I yourself but, as it were, in sort or limitation, to keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, and talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs of your good pleasure? If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife. - You are my true and honorable wife; as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart. - If this were true, then should I know this secret. I grant I am a woman; but withal a woman that Lord Brutus took to wife. Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em. I have made strong proof of my constancy, giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience and not my husband's secrets? - O ye gods, render me worthy of this most noble wife! Portia, go in awhile; and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart. And all my engagements I will construe to thee. - Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight. Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out, "Help, ho! "They murder Caesar!" Who's within? - My lord? - Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, and bring me their opinions of success. - I will, my lord. - What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth today? You shall not stir out of your house today. - Caesar shall forth. The things that threaten me ne'er look but on my back; when they shall see the face of Caesar, they are vanished. - Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, yet now they fright me. There is one within, besides the things that we have heard and seen, recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. A lioness hath whelped in the streets; and graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead. O Caesar, these things are beyond all use, and I do fear them! - What can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions are to the world in general as to Caesar. - When beggars die, there are no comets seen; the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. - Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once. - My lord? - What say the oracles? - They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, they could not find a heart within the beast. - Do not go forth today. Call it my fear that keeps you in the house, and not your own. Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. - For thy humor, I will stay at home. Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so. - Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the Senate-house. - And you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the Senators, and tell them that I will not come today. Cannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser. I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius. - Say he is sick. - Shall Caesar send a lie? Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far, to be afeard to tell grey-beards the truth? Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come. - Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so. - The cause is in my will; I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. But, for your private satisfaction, because I love you, I will let you know. Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent; and on her knee hath begg'd that I will stay at home today. - This dream is all amiss interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, in which so many smiling Romans bathed, signifies that from you great Rome shall suck reviving blood. This by Calpurnia's dream is signified. - And this way have you well expounded it. - I have, when you shall know all that I have to say. The Senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock apt to be render'd, for someone to say, break up the Senate til another time, when Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams. Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love to your proceeding bids me tell you this; and reason to my love is liable. - How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia! I am ashamed I did yield to them. Give me my robe, for I will go. And look where Brutus is come to fetch me. What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too? Good morrow, Casca. What is't o'clock? - Caesar, 'tis strucken eight. - I thank you for your pains and courtesy. See! Antony, that revels long o'nights, is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony. - So to most noble Caesar. - Now, Cinna? Now, Metallus. What, Trebonius! I have an hour's talk in store for you. Remember that you call on me today; be near me, that I may remember you. - Caesar I will. And so near will I be that your best friends shall wish that I were further. - Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me and we, like friends, will straight way go together. - That every like is not the same, O Caesar, the heart of Brutus yearns to think upon! - Is everyone in place? - Yes, we're prepared, fail not. - I wish your enterprise today may thrive. - What enterprise, Popilius? - Fare you well. - What said Popilius Lena? - He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discovered. - Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. - Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention. Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, for I will slay myself. - Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes; for, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. - Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus, he draws Mark Antony out of the way. - Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go, and presently prefer his suit to Caesar. - He is address'd; press near and second him. - Casca, you are the first to rear your hand. - Are we all ready? What is now amiss that Caesar and his Senate must redress? - Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart. - I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men, and turn pre-ordinance and first decree into the law of children. Be not fond, to think that Caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thaw'd from the true quality with that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words, low-crooked curtsies, and base spanielfawning. Thy brother by decree was banished. If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. - Caesar, thou dost me wrong. - Caesar did never wrong but with just cause, nor without cause will he be satisfied. - Is there no voice more worthy than my own, to sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear for the repealing of my banish'd brother? - I kiss thy hand, Caesar, but not in flattery; desiring thee that Publius Cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal. - What, Brutus? - Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon. As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall, to beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. - I could be well moved, if I were as you; if I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the northern star, of whose truefix'd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks, they are all fire, and every one doth shine; but there's but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men, and men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive; yet in the number I do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank, unshaked of motion, and that I am he, let me a little show it, even in this, that I was constant Cimber should be banish'd, and constant do remain to keep him so. - O Caesar-- - Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus? - Great Caesar-- - Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? - Speak, hands, for me! - You too, Brutus? Then fall, Caesar! - Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. - Some to the common pulpits and cry out, liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement! - People and senators, be not affrighted-- - Speak hands, for me. - Tyranny is dead, tyranny is dead! Crime upon the street, crime upon the street! - People, people and Senators! Be not afrightened! Fly not; stand still; ambition's debt is paid. - Go to the pulpit, Brutus. - And Cassius too. - Where's Antony? - Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run, as it were doomsday. - Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time and drawing days out, that men stand upon. - Why, he that cuts off 20 years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death. - Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged his time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, and let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood up to the elbows, and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, and waving our red weapons o'er our heads, let's all cry, peace, freedom, liberty! - Peace, freedom, liberty! - Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er in states unborn and accents yet unknown! - How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, that now on Pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust! - So oft as that shall be, so often shall the knot of us be call'd the ones that gave their country liberty. - What, shall we forth? - Aye, every one away. Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. - Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's. - Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel; thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down; and, being prostrate, thus he bade me say. Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving; say I love Brutus and I honor him; say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony may safely come to him, and be resolved how Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead so well as Brutus living; but shall follow all the affairs and fortunes of noble Brutus through the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith. So says my master Antony. - Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman; I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, he shall be satisfied and, by my honor, depart untouch'd. - I'll fetch him presently. - I know that we shall have him well to friend. - I wish I may. But yet have I a mind that fears him much; and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose. - But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony. - O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well. I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit as Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords, made rich with the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die. No place will please me so, no means of death, as here by Caesar, and by you cut off, the choice and master spirits of this age. - O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, as, by our hands and this our present act you see we do; yet see you but our hands. Our hearts you see not. They are pitiful, and pity to the general wrong of Rome hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, to you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. - Your voice shall be as strong as any man's in the disposing of new dignities. - Only be patient til we have appeased the multitude, beside themselves with fear, and then we will deliver you the cause why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, have thus proceeded. - I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you. Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand. Now, Decius Brutus, yours, now yours, Metellus. Yours, Cinna, and, my valiant Casca, yours. Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius. Gentlemen all, alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground, that one of two bad ways you must conceit me, either a coward or a flatterer. That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true. If then thy spirit look upon us now, shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy Antony making his peace, shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, most noble, in the presence of thy corse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart; here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand, sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe. O world, though wast the forest to this hart. And this O world the heart of thee. - Mark Antony-- - Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. - I blame you not for praising Caesar so; but what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be prick'd in number of our friends, hmm, or shall we on, and not depend on you? - Therefore I took your hands; but was indeed sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all, and love you all, upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. - Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard that were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, you should be satisfied. - That's all I seek. And am moreover suitor that I may produce his body to the marketplace; and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, speak in the order of his funeral. - You shall, Mark Antony. - Brutus, a word with you. You know not what you do; do not consent that Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter? - By your pardon. I will myself into the pulpit first, and show the reason of our Caesar's death. What Antony shall speak, I will protest he speaks by leave and by permission; it shall advantage more than do us wrong. - I know not what may fall; I like it not. - Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, but speak all good you can devise of Caesar; and say you do't by our permission; else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral. - I do desire no more. - Prepare the body, then, and follow us. - O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, that I am meek and gentle with these butchers! Thou art the ruins of the noblest men that ever lived in the time of times. And woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? - I do, Mark Antony. - Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. - He did receive his letters, and is coming; and bid me say to you by word of mouth. O Caesar! - Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching. Is thy master coming? - He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. - Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, no Rome of safety for Octavius yet; hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile; thou shalt not back til I have borne this corse into the marketplace. There shall I try, in my oration, how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men; according to the which thou shalt discourse to young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand. - We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied. - Then follow me, and give me audience, friends. - The noble Brutus is ascended; silence! - Be patient til the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers! - Oh, oh! - Hear me for my cause; and be silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom; and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. - Oh I'm judging you. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his. - Bullshit. - If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer. Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honor for his valor; and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. - None, Brutus, none. - Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enroll'd in the capitol, his glory not extenuated, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this I depart. That, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death. - Live, Brutus! Live, live! - Bring him with triumph home unto his house. - Give him a statue with his ancestors. - Let him be Caesar. - Caesar's best qualities shall be crown'd in Brutus. - We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. - My countrymen-- - Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks. - Peace, ho! - Good countrymen, let me depart alone. - No, no. - And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech tending to Caesar's glory; which Mark Antony, by our permission, is allow'd to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, save I alone, til Antony have spoke. - Stay, ho! And let us hear Mark Antony. - Let him go up into the public chair; we'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up. - For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you. - What does he say of Brutus? - He says, for Brutus' sake, he finds himself beholding to us all. - 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. - This Caesar was a tyrant. - Nay, that's certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say. - Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, for Brutus is an honorable man. - That's right, yes. - So are they all, all honorable men, come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me. But Brutus says he was ambitious; and Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. But Brutus says he was ambitious; and Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? But Brutus says he was ambitious; and, sure, he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, but here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him? O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason! Bear with me; my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause til it come back to me. - Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. - If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. - Has he not, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. - Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown; therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious. - If it be found so, some will dear abide it. - Poor soul! His eyes are red as fire with weeping. - There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. - Now mark him; he begins again to speak. - But yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he there, and none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong; I rather choose to wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you, than I will wrong such honorable men. But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar, I found it in his closet, 'tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, and they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds, and dip their napkins in his sacred blood; yea, beg a hair of him for memory, and, dying, mention it within their wills, bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue. - We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. - The will, the will, the will, the will! - Have patience, have patience gentle friends, I must not read it; it is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; and, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, it will inflame you, it will make you mad. - Read the will. - We will hear it Mark Antony. We will read the will, Caesar's will. - Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it. - They were traitors, honorable men! - The will, the testament! - They were villains, murderers. The will, read the will! - You will compel me, then, to read the will? - Aye! - Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, and let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? - Come down. - Descend. - You shall have leave. - A ring, stand round. Ring, stand round. - Stand from the hearse, stand from the body. - Room for Antony, noble Antony! - Nay, press not so upon me; stand far' off. - Stand back; room! Bear back. - If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd; and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away, mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it, as rushing out of doors, to be resolved if Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no; for Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel. This was the most unkindest cut of all; for when the noble Caesar saw him stab, ingratitude, stronger than traitors' arms, quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty heart; and, in his mantle muffling up his face, even at the base of Pompey's statue, which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us. What, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel the dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here! Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors. - O piteous spectacle! - O noble Caesar! - O woeful day! - O traitors, villains! - O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. - Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. - Bullshit. - What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, that made them do it; they're wise and honorable, and will, no doubt, with reasons answer you. - To hell with your reasons! - I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is; but, as you know me all, a plain blunt man, that love my friend. I only speak right on; I tell you that which you yourselves do know; show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths, and bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, and Brutus Antony, there were an Antony would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue in every wound of Caesar, that should move the stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. - We'll mutiny! Mutiny! - We'll burn the house of Brutus. - Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators. - Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Alas, you go to do you not what. Wherein Caesar hath deserved your love you have forgot the will I told you of. - Most true; the will! Let's stay, and hear the will. - Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal. To every Roman citizen he gives, to every several man, 75 drachmas. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, his private arbors, and newplanted orchards, on this side Tiber. He hath left them you, and to your heirs forever; common pleasures, to walk abroad, and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? - Never, never. Come, away, away! We'll burn his body in the holy place, and with the brands fire the traitors' houses. Take up the body. - Go, fetch fire. - Pluck down benches. - Pluck down forms, windows, any thing. - Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot, take thou what course thou wilt! How now, fellow? - Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. - Where is he? - He is at Caesar's house. - And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry, and in this mood will give us any thing. - I heard 'em say Brutus and Cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. - Belike they had some notice of the people, how I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. - I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, and things unluckily charge my fantasy. I have no will to wander forth of doors, yet something leads me forth. - What is your name? - Whither are you going? - Where do you dwell? - Are you a married man or a bachelor? - Answer every man directly. - Aye, and briefly. - Aye, and wisely. - Aye, and truly; you were best. - What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly. Wisely I say I am a bachelor. - That's as much as to say they are fools that marry; you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly. - Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral. - As a friend, or an enemy? - As a friend. - That matter is answered directly. - For your dwelling, briefly. - Briefly, I dwell by the capitol. - Your name, sir, truly. - Truly, my name is Cinna. - Tear him to pieces! He's a conspirator. - I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet. - Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses. - I am not Cinna the conspirator. - It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him going. - Tear him, tear him! Come; brands, ho! Firebrands. To Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, and some to Casca's'. Away, go! - Over thy wounds now do I prophesy. A curse shall light upon the limbs of men. Domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of the known world. Blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quartered with the hands of war. All pity choked with custom of fell deeds. - Most noble brother, you have done me wrong. - Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies? And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother? - Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs. And when you do them-- - Remember March, the Ides of March remember. Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake? What villain touch'd his body, that did stab, and not for justice? - You know that you are Brutus that speak this, and by the gods this speech wilst your last! - Away, slight man! - O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this? - All this? Aye, more. Fret til your proud heart break; go show your slaves how choleric you are, and make your bondmen tremble. - Do not presume too much upon my love. I may do that I shall be sorry for! - You have done that you should be sorry for! - Ye gods, ye gods! - There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads unto fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a-- - On such a full sea are we now afloat, and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures. - Fly further off, my lord, fly further off! Mark Antony is in your tent, my lord. Fly, therefore noble Cassius, fly far off. - This hill is far enough. Go Pindarus, get higher on that hill and tell me what thou notes about the field. This day I breathed first. Time has come round and where I did begin, there shall I end. My life has run its compass. Sirrah, what news? - Oh, my lord! - What news? - Trebonius is enclosed round about with horsemen, that make to him on the spur, yet he spurs on! Now they're almost on him. Now, now Trebonius! Now some light. Oh, he lights too! Oh he's ta'en. And hark, they shout for joy. - Come down. Bold no more. Come hither, sirrah. In Parthia did I take thee prisoner and then I swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever I bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath. Now be a free man. And with this good sword that ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom. Stand not to answer, here, take thou the hilt. And when my face is covered as 'tis now, guide thou the sword. Caesar. Thou art revenged. Even with the sword that killed thee. - So I am free yet would not so have be. - Liberty, freedom! - Yet. Yet countrymen. Oh yet, hold up your heads. Countrymen, follow me! I am Brutus! Know me for Brutus! Marcus Brutus I! Brutus, my country friend! Know me for Brutus! Come poor remains of friends, rest on this rock. - Decius showed the torchlight but my lord, he came not back. He is or ta'en or slain. - Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word. It is a deed in fashion. Come hither, good Cinna. List a word. - Says my lord? - Why this, Cinna. I know my hour has come. - Not so, my lord. - Nay I am sure it is, Cinna. Thou seest the world, Cinna, how it goes. Our enemies have beat us to the pit. It's more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry til they push us. Good Cinna, thou knowst we two went to school together. Even for that our love of old I prithee, hold thou my sword hilt whilst I run on it. - That's not an office for a friend, my lord. - Fly, fly my lord, there's no tarrying here. Fly, my lord, fly! - Hence. I will follow. I prithee Strato, stay thou by thy lord. Thou art a fellow of a good respect. Thy life hath had some smack of honor in it. Hold then my sword and turn away thy face while I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato? - Give me your hand first. Fare thee well, my lord. - Farewell, good Strato. Caesar, now be still. I killed not thee with half so good a will. ♪ A glass of you ♪ ♪ A mirror ♪ ♪ Which one ♪ ♪ Distracts like open windows ♪ ♪ In the gusts a calm day will come ♪ ♪ A calm day will ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ In a telescope now ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ In a telescope now ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ Fever in bedtime covers ♪ ♪ Cold unknown ♪ ♪ This fight it grows and misses ♪ ♪ Sinks and floats ♪ ♪ A calm day will come ♪ ♪ My calm days will ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ This joint is ♪ ♪ Only for you happy for you only for you happy for you ♪ ♪ Happy for you ♪ ♪ Happy for you ♪ ♪ You happy for you ♪
