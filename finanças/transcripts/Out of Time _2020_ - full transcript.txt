I know how he fucking feels. (Laughs) Take me back! Please! (Laughs) So, Dad. Did I tell you about the new swimming baths that have just opened? No son. It's brilliant. We'll have to go. Did I tell you about the new shop by us as well? No, son. It's absolutely brilliant. We'll have to go. Did I tell you about the... Aww hey! Got any ear muff shops? He hasn't shut up since we got in the car. You are like an old woman. Let me just tell you this Dad. Yeah, let him just tell you this, Dad. No, seriously Sam, my ears have actually fallen off. You might have to take me back to prison, Before I lose any more body parts. What's that shit on your nail? Jammed it in a door. Looks worse than it is. Has he got enough toys out there? No, the bouncy castle is in the cupboard. Stop finding fault. I'm not, I'm just saying. With all that gear, you couldn't swing a fucking mouse. Oh, shut your face! Oh! Wounded! Oh, but her opponent hasn't finished with her yet. Don't you dare! He's going in to finish her. Don't be silly. And will she tap out? I tap out, I tap out you big divvy. You might have won, but only because I let you. That's why I love your mother, son. She's a fighter. God, I missed you. Dad! Come and see my room! Come on. Oh no! We can't have you in a room like this! You need a decent pad for when you're entertaining the ladies. Erm, he's eleven. What's this? No Dad! You're not two! Mum! Tell him! That's the one you got him, before you went inside. Remember? I need to get him into some training. You need some Dad time. And a proper haircut. He needs nothing, leave him alone! Are you OK? I'll be OK. I promise. Don't forget to hide that. I've got us, Champagne! The lot! If you can't buy your husband a bottle of champagne on his release date When can you? I even went mad and got us a bottle of tequila! Ooh! La! Oh no. That's French isn't it? Or is it Mexican? Could even be Spanish. Oh shit! The strawberries! Now apparently, these enhance the flavour of the champagne. Here's me, thinking it's just for decoration. Am I talking to myself? Yeah. Are you OK? It often seems weird. Brighter. Different. I feel odd. Just standing here. Tomorrow will probably be better. Go to the gym and stuff. Feel more familiar. I keep thinking someone's going to tap me on the shoulder and drag me back to a cell. Come here. Right, are we having this champagne or what? I'm going to need to call the boys. You've only been out five minutes. I need to find out how the gym is getting on.

OK, If you'd like to make your way to the seating area, I'll let the doctor know you're here. Thanks love. Mrs. Cunningham? Would you like to come through? I think you're aware of the reasons we called you back. Unfortunately Sheila... The results confirm our worst fears. The cancer has spread at an incredible rate, and I'm sorry to say... It's not great news. What we ca do, is continue the treatment... Keep the dosages around the same, maybe improve things a little... Sheila! Sheila! Sheila! Why do I have to go though? Because... your Dad thinks he's helping. And why he thinks he's helping... It gives us more time. More time for me to get my face smashed in? Connor, your dad's not going to let you get hurt. Have you seen Warrior? He's like a fuckin' block of flats! What have I told you about that mouth? Will my dad do ballet? Look, I'll speak to him. Promise. Just give me more time. Why did my dad do time? I never got told the full story. We've been over this a million times. Your dad was a fighter, someone go hurt, end of. Now come on. Shouldn't have brought this. You lot like nuts and seeds don't you. Not stale bloody bread. But you eat it. 'Cause you've got no choice. It's no good for you. Do you know, tomorrow? I'm bringing you lot, nuts and seeds. See this crap? It's going in the bin. What? Oh, come on! It's a full packet. I'm not made of money you know. (Laughing) No way! I only mention the.. off the headlights. How are you Rob? Come on. Come on lad. Dig deep. Come on. Harder! Come on lad. Well done. keep going. You're skipping like a fuckin' three year old bird. Come on lad. You've got a fight on Saturday. Get stuck in. That's it. Come on! There he is, that's him. That's the one I was telling you about. (Laughing) Freak. I can't stop thinking about it. Imagine being eleven. In School. And having no mates. He's got... no mates. I really need to speak to you about something. It's important. I'm sorry. For not being here. It's all my fault. It's not your fault. He's... He's just quiet. He doesn't mix well. Why? Look. People will behave better now that you're out. You think? Yeah. I'm going to spend more time with him. I'm going to get a bigger house. We'll invite all his mates over. And all the families. He's gonna have loads of mates. Yeah. Sounds great. I'm a freak aren't I? Just because something's different... doesn't mean it isn't right. Why's it happened to me though? I wish I knew. All's I know is that the way you look and feel don't match. They will to you one day. You're dong great. And Iâm with you. Every step of the way. Everyone thinks I'm weird. I think I'm weird. Look, are we dying? No. Is anybody sick? No. So we can fix it. Not all at once. But it's doable. Our biggest hurdle... is You're scared to tell him. Aren't you? I'm not scared Connor. I'm bloody terrified. I thought this was our happy place. And all me and you've done is bloody whinge. So are you going to push me or what? With that arse? Oh, you have had it now! Ooh, you better run! (Laughter) Wooo! Go on, hard, hit it. That's it. I heard you were back. Any chance of putting on a show for the old fans? Me and you back in the cage. You'll earn a few dollar. Not interested. Gone all fucking queer on us have yer? I've heard that happens after a long stretch. Don't be a prick, I'm not allowed to fight anymore. Totally off the record, nobody's going to have to know. Do me a favour? Fuck off! Still have the mist though. Come on. I'm here to make you an offer. What? If I win, I take the gym. And when I win? 200K The club's not worth that. It's worth what I think it's worth if I have to pay. It's not for sale. I know that. That's why I'm going to have to win it. Do you want a cookie? I made them last night. Eyugh. I knew you'd hate them, I wish I hadn't bothered now. Right. Stop worrying. If he comes over, fake a dizzy spell, you can pretend you don't speak English. I know I'm not part of your family, and I know I'm not anyone special... now come to think of it, I'm really lousy at words of advice, but, I'm here to share the pain. If you need a friend that is. I can't believe you just got filled in by that midget. Nothing ever changes though does it? Absolutely. What do you reckon anyway? Who is he first? Oh, just some dickhead from way back. Is he legit? Got the money like? Defo worth it, not as if he's got dough like that to throw around. Listen, say nothing to Sam though. OK? All clear mate. Nice one. Stay cool brother. Look after yourself. See you later. Careful in that... yeah? Dickhead. Hang on kids. Right, come on. See yers tomorrow. Go on. Ahhhh. Thanks Pop... It's gorgeous that. Eh, well done. See you tomorrow kids. Aw, tarrrah love. Come on girls, hurry up! Nancy, I made this for you. Did you make it or cough it up? It's a chocolate strawberry. Oh, alright, go on. Hiya Nance Hiya love. Terrifies me here, this one. He's just not settling in. It's like thereâs always something on his mind. It's my fault Guv. I'm sure the added security of me being home... He'll be back to his best in a couple of weeks. He's also been having some bother with another boy. Tommy Smith The big fucker? I'll have a word with his dad, it'll be sound. You will not. We don't want the situation to worsen Mr Yates. Letting the school handle such complex issues is certainly the way forward. Connor only seems to talk to a girl. Annie Larkin. Maybe we should have little Annie over for tea? Good idea. Well thank you very much for your time. If you excuse me, I've got Mrs Smith, Tommy's mum waiting to speak to me. Mr. Yates, Thank you. Mrs. Yates. Bye. Bye. Take your time, I've got all day here. Fifteen minutes I've been stood here. Twiddling me thumbs. You think someone would apologise? But no. No decorum, some people. Vile. You've got something hanging out yer mouth there love. Your arsehole! Oh, I'm... terrified. All these criminals in this school. My little Tommy.. Surrounded by such vile s... I'd best get out of the way hadn't I? Before I get murdered as well. Sort your feet out. Fix them. Come on Now hit me. But why? Because I'm Tommy Smith! Now hit me. Connor, a girl wouldn't even hit like that, now concentrate! Connor! Aw, it's boss here. A psychiatrist's report? What's this all about? We were gonna tell you sooner, but with you being away, well it's just been so much harder to deal with. This is my son... we're talking about. Now look Danny, before you explode... This is not something you're gonna understand straight away. Understand? He is eleven... years old! If I can't understand it, how can he? Kids get confused. I'm not gay Dad! I'd prefer it if you was! What have you done to him? I'll pretend I haven't heard that. My son.. doesn't move from his mother's side for eight years, and now he wants to be a girl? It's about him finally being himself. I was born a boy... you were born a girl. That's life. Accept it! Ah, none of it is that black and white Danny! It is where I come from! Yeah, it would be wouldn't it? How long's it been going on? It's not important right now. How long? How long? Since he was four. Four? And you decide to tell me now? You made this decision without me! You said it's OK for my son... to be a girl! So now he thinks it's OK! I know... what happened to you as a kid was fucked up. But you forced this. How dare you? This is not about you or me! This is about him being comfortable in his own skin. This is about him being able to look in the mirror... without wanting to... Stop fighting! I've tried so hard to fit into this body I've been born into, Dad. And I can't pray any more than I do. That I wake up the person I'm supposed to be. I can't deal with this. Dad? You try wearing a dress for a day and see how it feels. You feel like a freak. You hate almost every second you're alive. Nice to have you here Annie. Oh thanks for asking. Well, I had to. 'Cause our Connor never would. Nothing's wrong with being shy. I'm not shy! I cry all the time. I don't like it, 'cause my face looks all squashed up like this. I am weird though. Better to be weird than not OK. Turn around. What? Just turn around. OK. God! Connor! You look better in pink than me! Call me Connie. OK. Connie. If I hadn't gone away. This would never have happened. I thought I'd got rid of all the evil in our lives. And now this. This is our child you're talking about. How are you so OK with this? Because he's unhappy, Danny. Really unhappy. You've got no idea what we've been through. What if he's made a mistake? Starts to take these hormone tablets... and he's got it wrong. He's not wrong. He's a kid! His brain is developing... every day. He's becoming more of a girl... every day. Am I the only one who's thinking about this properly? This... is not... OK. Come on She! For the final time queen, I need you to pay up. Sheila! Come on! Listen, I've cancelled the holiday to the Bahamas. And I've put on hold the trip around the world. Me and the missus thought about going to Bognor Regis. We've heard that the weather's not as good, but... Sheila! She! Sheila! Sheila! Sheila! Sheila! Sheila! Speak to me Sheila! Sheila! Sheila talk to me! Hello. Ah, there we go. Back home. A bit of rest will do you the world of good. With some quality time with your daughter eh? That'll be nice. Straight through here please. Eh! I'm good. I, er... I'd better be off. Erm... She can be a bit of a loner, your mother. That's why I offered to pick her up from the hospital. Scary things those ambulances., when you're sick. Well, that's more than you should have done. Thank you so much. Oh! Do I owe you anything? Does my mother owe you anything? Thirteen pounds sixty. That's if you've got it... It's just... A couple of weeks she was behind a little bit, so... I've only got a twenty! Ah!, do you know what? Keep it. For your petrol... And your kindness... Keep hold of it. You know what? Sort me out again another time. You sure? Yeah. Honestly, it's... it's... erm. Are you sure? Thank you. Bye. Hello? Can I speak to the head please? Youâre a freaky kid you! Are you gay? Your dad's not here to protect yer! Hey, who thinks me and Yatesy should have a straightener You know, just to see if he's not gay. I hear that Tommy Smith! Get to the office, now! So as you can imagine Mrs Yates, How we deal with this needs to treated with the utmost consideration. And dealt with sensitively We've never dealt with transitioning before. So we'll have to talk to those above to see the best approach possible for our children. And Connor himself. Indeed. Herself. So call me any time Mrs Yates. Whenever Connor feels it's the right time to come out... Own clothes day? I'll get back to you. And rest assured, we'll be doing our best to make it as smooth as possible for all concerned. OK, and you. Bye Mrs Yates. Why are you always the last one out? I had to keep him behind to have a word with him about his behaviour. There's no need for that. Jesus, come on, we need to go shopping. Mum! What does transitioning mean? 'Cause... What? Julie, wait 'til you hear this! It's about me mum! I'm not hungry. I'll do you soup and a sandwich. I didnât want to come here you know, Sam. They said you're not allowed to stay on your own. Because of how aggressive the... And that you should be with McMillan nurses 24/7. But I said, I'd rather have you here. I was going to tell you, you know. Why didn't you then? I didn't think you'd believe me, I didn't think you'd care. That's rich. Coming from someone who didn't believe me my whole childhood. Sorry. I'm sorry Sam. I needed you. When he came her that day. It was like he knew. He knew I was on my own. And from the moment I opened the door... I froze. I couldn't speak. I couldn't move. And I've gone over, and over it in my mind. What I'd do if ever I saw him again. But I did... nothing. And here I was again! Reliving those horrific moments. I did nothing! And I looked up and I'd seen Danny, standing in the doorway. And he had tears in his eyes. And I knew. I knew he knew. And the sense of relief. Oh, God! Was incredible. Because you thin you're going mad. You question yourself. You say... Was it me? Did I egg him on? Did I smile too sweetly? What did I do to make him do those horrible things to me? I was ten years old! And then I looked at Danny and I knew he'd lost it. There was like a scuffle at first, and then... and then it just went silent. I lost Danny for eight years because of him! Oh Sam, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. If I could turn the clock back... I would. But I can't. Oh, he warped my mind more than you'd ever know. Sam, Iâm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Connor. Come here love. Your nan's going to be staying with us for a while. Nan? Come here, let me see. Didn't see this coming did we? Keep your voice down. Connor's up there. He'll hear all this. You do know he'll be alienated for this, don't you? Battered and laughed at! Every time he turns around. Are you ready for that? Go to bed Danny. You're drunk. We'll talk more about this in the morning. We'll talk about it now. Thant kid up there is mixed up and confused. It's all for attention. My attention! Do you not think I am terrified for him? But Iâm even more petrified if he stays the way he is. My son wants to be a girl. And she... She is living in my house! What if I don't like this other kid? You love his soul. Not what his body looks like. I love that face though. Me too. Connor? I didn't realise you were in here. I'm er... Just going up. Cancer. My arse. Another fine example you're setting. Just keep it away from my son. I wouldnât do it around him. You know, Dan? You've got a really good kid there. It's just that... Do you think I'm going to take parental advice off you? You stood round while your own kid got molested. You make me sick. Now do me a favour and get back to what you do best. Chain smoking. Because the sooner you're gone from here, the better. I don't know what's so funny Tommy Smith. But any more of it, you and the rest of the class will be in detention. What have I done? Can I go to the toilet please Miss? Yes, be quick. Which one? The boys' or the girls'? (Laughter) Tommy! Hey! Keep away. Stop it! You like to wear dresses don't you? Stop it. What do you want? Therese, quick. It's Tommy! What? Tommy! Hey babe are you alright? I'm alright. Oh baby! What the hell are you doing here? I just fought off Tommy Smith. He fell. Anyway, I don't think he'll get me again. What are you doing? (Cheering) Dad! What are you doing here? I said "go home" Get off! Oooff! Fuck! Get off! What are you doing? I should go back in. Watch him. Stay here with me, alright. Please mate, just stay here with me, yeah? Please Leo. It's important. No, I need you to stay out here alright, we'll go back in a bit. Hello babe... Yeah, yeah, you know... Yeah, I know, I don't know what about it? Dad! Dad! You can do it! What's that all about? What? The hat? No, that face. Dad, I can't stop thinking about the fight. It was so good. I reckon, we need to celebrate. And I've got an idea. Hi My name's Richard. I'll be your advisor today. Anything you may be interested in? What it is mate we're looking for is a pad. Quite big in size but with plenty of outdoor space. And the price range? Give me whatever you've got. OK, well we have this, sir. Which is a five bed just up the road. The size is OK... Well, If it's size that you're looking for. I've got a lovely five bed cottage up in Frodsham. What do you reckon Connor? Which one's the biggest? I like your style. Would you like to go for a viewing? Does a bear shit in the woods? OK, so you're in luck. The proprietor's away at the moment. Would you like to go now? Could I get the address for the wife? Yes, It's Lake view cottage Frodsham. Lead the way Dickie boy! Paige, would you like to go and get me the keys? I'll just go and get you the keys now. OK? As I was saying, the property boasts it's own private driveway. It sits beautifully upon a ten acre plot. There's plenty of room for development and... Look, Dickie. I haven't been completely honest with you here. I mean, I'd gladly buy the property. Who wouldn't? But the thing is. The funds aren't exactly there... Yet. OK And there's a slight chance. Just a slight chance... there might be a few people there before us. Well, I've just got out of nick you see... Nick! Prison? And serious! Well, murder. Murder! You murdered someone Dad? Connor, not now. But, Dad! But nothing, I mean it Connor, say nothing. No one listens to me anyway. So as I was saying Dickie boy. Â£500 top pocket? You know the rules. Say nothing. How many are expected? I mean, these lips are sealed. Now look happy. The pair of you. No one said it was a party! Oh my god! The boy did good. Excellent! K.O. mate, well done! Yes Danny boy. Yes man. Give me that bevvy! Hey man there's a party in there. Hiya babe. Here's the shirt you wanted. What's she doing here? I couldn't leave her on her own. Stop being horrible. What's all this? I'll tell you what this is. He's finally become a man. He beat off Tommy Smith, helped me out with a little something, and you know what? Everything's going to be OK. A little something? Oo-er! What's wrong with him? Don't even ask. What have you done? What? Talk to your mum like the piece of shit that she is. Danny, she's dying. Good. I can't wait. Don't you think that we have enough to deal with without you doing all this? Exactly the reason we're here celebrating. Having a laugh, having a bit of fun. Do you remember what that is? Celebrating what? Danny! Celebrating what? I wasn't going to tell yer. But I've had a fight. I won! Why would you risk going back? I did it for us. A bit of business? So you've had a fight in front of our child! Oh my God, Danny! Don't you understand? I can't, I can't risk losing you again. Iâd willingly go back rather than put up with the embarrassment... of this freak show of a family. That's it isn't it? This is all about you! You and your macho image. Fuck how me and Connor feel. This is about you! You selfish arrogant... Carry on! I dare yer! Now you're being ridiculous. I would never... hit you. You want to though, don't yer? What's happening to us? Connor? Go on in love. Connor? Connor. Don't move love. Donât move. Stay where you are. Somebody get Sam! Be still, just stay there. Don't move. No! No, stay where you are, stay where you are. Shhhh. What's the point? You'll never understand. Don't dare, don't you dare. Dan, you listen to him. Don't be like me. Please, don't be like me. Please! Dan! Do something! Now, please do something! That's my world up there. Don't jump, please don't jump, please! Connor. Please don't do this. You're the most important thing in my life. You'll never Chang, Dad! I'll try. Really... Try... Please... I'm sorry, come down, please. I'll try. Oh, Connor! Oh mate! Oh my gosh, I love you so much! I'm sorry, Iâm so sorry. Argh! Open. You look beautiful. Well? Let's see then. I'm just not sure this top goes with this skirt. Are you kidding me? It's a perfect match. You are beautiful. Is he really going to go in like that? Please, Dad. Say, she. I'm sorry... I won't be able to do this today. Well, I for one, would not miss this, for the world. Right. Let's do this. Holy shit! On this occasion. You don't have to curb the language. Holy shit! I can't do it mum! Yes yer can! This is the first day of the rest of your life. You, hold your head up high. You own it, my beauty. Hang on Nancy babe! You really didn't think Iâd miss it did yer? Come on. Looking good kid! Proud of you baby. Clapping and cheering. Urgh! There's a fly in that! Was there? It's your go. You just cheated then! How can you cheat at this? Mum, tell him! He would never cheat on you. I win! Hey! Go slow or Iâm going to bounce over to next door! I think I've just pooed! (Laughter)
