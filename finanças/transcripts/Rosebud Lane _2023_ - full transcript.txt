Wow, three frozen concepts? Yeah, about to be four. Next Bandini has just hit a wall. That bad? I, I don't even know. I, I can't even tell anymore. I got to step away from this. Did you feed Orson? No. What's that? Oh, something for you. You're going to open it? It's got your name on it. Yeah. I see it's got my name on it. What is it? It's a card. Hmm. From who? My son. - Aaron, go back and help Boone. And don't you track any crud back into my kitchen, I think he got Okay. Research. On what? Carl Sandburg. I was going to use one of his poems as, uh, narration for my White Lies screenplay. How'd you meet? She was at a shabby interstate coffee shop, just outside Flat Rock. She was a waitress. Right out of a James Cayne Paperback, right? Was your divorce final yet? It wasn't. Did Stephanie know? Know what? That you fucked a shabby coffee shop waitress while you were still married to her? The coffee shop was shabby. I assure you, she was not. Noted. Did you know you had a son? Sidney? Yes. -Sidney? -Yeah? Did you, uh-- Have you been sending her child support? Please tell me you have. It's complicated. Um... I did when I first learned she had him. But, uh... ...she never cashed the checks. Six, seven months went by and... ...the money never left my account, and... ...I tried to contact her. But... But? She never cashed the checks. She never responded. So, I... I kind of gave up. And, um... ...kind of chose to... ...forget about it. Forget about her. Forget about them. What are you going to do? I'm, I'm going to go to him. Good answer. Which poem? A Father To His Son. It's time for school. Just leave it in the sink and get going. Excuse me. - Have a good day, sweetheart. - -You, too. Hey, y'all.

Okay, well, the next time you come through, you just ask for old Sugar and I'll take care of you. We will, Sugar. You've made us feel so welcome. Well, thank you. You know, I just never met a stranger. That's what my mama said. My daddy died not too long ago. He was over a hundred. Smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, eight oxtails, Ding Dongs, and French Fries I mean, it just must be in the genes. - I agree. - -Well, I'll take care of this when you're ready. You all have a good day. - Thank you. - Thanks. -Can I top you off? -Yes, please. Thank you so much. Oh, little darling, you are in the Carolinas. You only have to thank me this much. All right. All right, Timbo, we'll take this when you're ready. Everything... Thank you very much. Well, me and Beth would love to see you whenever you get home. That sounds great. I'll bring Orson. Take him to the park. I think they'd love that. So would I. Thank you. All right. You have a good day. Wondered if I'd ever see you again. It's good to see you. You, too. So what brings you back? He didn't tell you? Who? Your... Our son. He wrote me. He did what? Yeah. Yeah. Um... I didn't know that. Okay. Well, right? Uh... do you want to go somewhere? Maybe we could talk. Maybe when you're done working, I guess he - got your address from my old phone - Mmm. -Imagine my surprise. -Yeah, I bet. And my wife's. Oh, shit. How'd that go? Better than you might think, actually. That's good. Y'all have kids? My wife and I have decided to not have children. Why is that? Mm, because we're more career-minded than most, which is not that uncommon in our circles. Sounds kind of selfish, I guess. Nah. Cages out. - Oh! - You got to get going? No, it's just Aaron. I'm going to tell him I'm picking up Thai food on the way home. Is that funny? Thai's my favorite too. It's an amazing country. We're in Bangkok last year. Well, I will put it on my list. So, what's he like? -Aaron? -No, your dentist. Yes, Aaron. I don't know. I guess he's mostly your average ten-year-old boy. I, I don't even know what that means. Is that video games, - football, laughs at fart jokes? What, what exactly? One out of three. Oh, Aaron never got into video games, thank God. And he's not much of a jock. He's more artsy, I guess. He loves to read, and he's pretty good at drawing things. He does real good in English. Hmm. Interesting. He did not get that from me. Oh, and he loves movies. Really? What kind? Mostly old ones. He's always talking about them. I'm just like, "Okay, kid." Hmm. Can I ask you something? How come I never cashed your checks? Yeah. Why didn't you? I didn't want you thinking that you had some kind of responsibility, or right to come back and start acting like you could tell me what to do with my son. You know, I wanted to have him, and you didn't get a say in the matter. And I didn't think it was fair to make you pay for it. I have grown up a lot since then. Ooh, being a mother will make you do that. Well, and Aaron... ...he is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Are you mad? No. Quite the contrary. You want more? Yeah, yeah. Hey, Mel. So, Sidney Granger, Mr. Big-time Hollywood movie maker, how do you want to play this? Ms. Ginny, I'm going to put this a hundred percent on you. -Thanks. -Thank you. Well, I appreciate that. Uh... He works with Boone after school tomorrow. Again, he's a family friend. He... ...does a lot of stuff around the yard, back sheds. He fixes stuff. Yeah. Pretty sure I've met Boone. Uh, well, that'll put Aaron home around 5:30, so, why don't you come by around 6:00? You sure you're okay with this? I wouldn't invite you over to my house if I wasn't. I mean, you came all this way. It says a lot. Okay. It's a date. Oh, spill it, Granger. Ginny, Ginny, Ginny. I tell you, Ginny is your classic Jane Austen heroine. Um, strong-willed, whip-smart, full speed ahead, no-nonsense Annie Oakley. That's quite a description. You'd love Sugar. Sugar? Waitress. Works with Ginny at the truck stop. Straight out of Central Casting. Part Flannery O'Connor, part Portis. Could've been pulled from the pages of Norwood. Too Funny. - And there's Boone. - Boone, that's a great name. Yeah, isn't it? He's not thrilled with my presence. Is he dangerous? No, not dangerous. Just old school, Mark Twain bully. Threatened, I guess. He's no Doyle Lanigan. You better be careful. You don't know these people, Sidney. You know, my brain is mush. I got to shut it down now. I'm serious. Yeah, good night. Love you. Aaron usually feeds the dog. You told him I was coming, right? Of course. You nervous? Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, be honest, I'm nervous too. I didn't really think this day would ever come. I suppose I thought it might. I guess it was inevitable. Your dog's name is Orson? Funky, right? Aaron named him after some movie maker he likes. -It's grown on me. -Yeah, it's going to sound crazy. - That's the name of our dog. - -Aaron, sweetheart, we're in the kitchen. Aaron. This... is your father. Aaron. I got your card. Thank you for that. It's really nice to meet you. Aaron. Shake your daddy's hand. Aaron? -It's okay. -No, it's not. I made a mistake. Aaron? Hey, get back here right now! - That's okay. It's fine. - Aaron! No, no, no. Let him go. He's scared. Well, you had to expect it wasn't going to be easy. Yeah, I did. Okay. Well, then don't beat yourself up. Get a good night's sleep and see what tomorrow brings. See what tomorrow brings. I'll wake up and walk the plank. I don't think he likes me. Come on. He doesn't even know you. Give it a chance. Everybody likes you. Good one. Oh, I almost forgot. We need to book our Bali flight, or we're going to lose those miles. Ah, shit. You still want to go, right? Yeah. Good. It's a PAX. Nice. Roman Holiday. Sidney? Hmm? Bonnie and Clyde. Hmph. Arthur Penn. Gladiator. Ridley Scott. All About Eve. Joseph Mankiewicz. Opening Night. John Cassavetes. Last Picture Show. Bogdanovich. The Last Detail. Hmm. Hal Ashby. The West Side Story. Sidney? Good night, sweetheart. So does he look like you? How should I know? -Well, did you look at him? -Yeah. -Well, how did it go? -I don't know. -Are you going to see him again? -I don't know. - Come on. You have to. - Maybe. How you doing, Sheriff? Top shape, shape out, man. You still owe me for two pies, Sheriff. Just put it on my tab, baby. Hey, how about them grits, huh? You know what? I am a convert now. You know, Aaron's just confused. And he probably didn't think you'd really come all this way. Are you okay that I did? Yeah, I am. Well, I think maybe he liked it better when you were just fantasy. That makes sense. I'm going to talk to him today after school. I think it's important, you know? You following me? Leave Aaron alone. Maybe that's between my son and me. Okay? I didn't come here to cause any trouble. Yes, you did. Really? Why is that? Cause I ain't stupid. Everybody here was doing just fine without you, okay? I could see that. So go back to California then. You don't scare me. I should... ...snap you like a dry branch. Hey. -What can I get you? -An old-fashioned, please. Thanks. Okay. Nice town you got here. We have our moments. Hmm. Hello. Really? Uh, now? Yeah, now's good. Sure. No. No, no. Now is good. Um, I'm on my way. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Uh, looks like I'm one and done. Thanks. What's your name? -Pete. -Pete. Sidney. - Sidney. - -For sure, I'll see more of you. - Sounds good. Take care. - You too. Did you ever meet James Dean? Uh, he was a bit before my time. He's my favorite actor. He was special. - Love the movie seat. - Thanks. Boone found it in a junker. Got it for my birthday. Very cool. Do you play? Boone's teaching me. You look up to him, huh? He's just a friend. Well, you're lucky to have such a good friend. - What type of movies do you make? Good ones, I hope. I like Westerns. Oh, yeah? What's your favorite? Johnny Guitar. Ooh, classic. Yeah, Joan Crawford. "Come and get me, Mr. McIvers." It's a good film. You know your Westerns. - Have you ever made one? - No, I haven't. Started writing one once. Why did you stop? Got to the second act, realized I had a half a film. Put that one in the freezer. Second act is the hardest one to write. Yes, it is. Yeah. Aaron, come get your dog. I have to go, walk the dog. - Care if I join? - Sure. - I can let Orson off at the end of the road. I bet he loves that. He always stops to make sure I'm still looking at him. He's a good dog. You know, Sterling Hayden couldn't even play the guitar. Pretty amazing what actors have to do, huh? Seems like he played it pretty good. Well, he's a good actor. Did you actually put your script in the freezer? That's a figure of speech. There's a creek right down the road. Have you ever eaten crawfish? - Hey, guys. - Hey, mom. - Take your shoes off. - Okay. - Y'all have a nice walk? - Yeah, sure did. Boy, that dog has a lot of energy. Still acts like a puppy. Some dogs never grow up. That's Boone. Can I go see what he wants? You can, but we're eating soon. Don't ride off. Be back soon. Stay for dinner? Let me guess. Crawfish? Not quite. Uh, you know what? I actually-- I probably should get going. All right. Thanks, though. And I got to say today was, um... It was awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Did you make any plans I should know about? I just thought I'd take him for a drive up into the mountains. Which mountains? You're in the Blue Ridge, man. But he ain't never been to the Smoky, or the Snowboard, or the Tuskegee. You could take him up to Ratcliff, but then you have to take the Lake Stone Ridge, and that drive might spook you if you have a weak stomach. Do not go up to Rattlesnake or Lookout Tower because then you're on the reservation. Or I could just go to the movies. -Did you like the movie? -Blew me away. Yeah. Me too. Really sad. But the cinematography was amazing. Though I wish it would have been in black and white. Really? Why is that? Seems it would've fit the story better, like in Touch of Evil. Huh. Would've been a good choice. I could see that. Most people in Hollywood don't think black and white films make any money. So you want to direct movies? -I don't know. Maybe. -All right. Hey, Aaron. Hey. -Who's that? -That's Phoebe. -Oh. -She's just a friend. -Have you ever seen Vivacious Lady? -No. I'll show it to you. George Stevens, he's a great director, -He made Giant, didn't he? -Yes, he did. - 24. - What's that? Orson Welles was 24 when he made Citizen Kane. Yes. So my wife and I, we play a game called Name of The Director. - You want to play? - Sure. - Okay. - How do you play? Well, it's pretty easy. One person names the film. The other person names the director. Okay? - Okay. - You start. Red River. Uh, Howard Hawks. How about It's a Wonderful Life? - Frank Capra. - Good. Uh, A Fistful of Dollars. Ah. Too easy. Sergio Leone. How about, uh, Seven Samurai? Hmm? I'll give you a hint. He's Japanese. - I don't know any Japanese films. - Oh! Come on, you got to know this guy. He's a legend. - No? - Uh-huh. - Who's your mom talking to? - That's Mr. Mills. - Who's Mr. Mills? - He rents our house. My mom used to work for him. - Doing what? - Paperwork, I think. He's good with numbers. Oh. Nice guy? I suppose. Boone doesn't like him. Shocker. I got to go do my homework. Good boy. - Thanks for the movie. - You got it. Fun Night. Akira Kurosawa. That's who directed Seven Samurai. Remember him. - He's a good one. - Okay. Good night, Dad. Good night, son. Hey, Mom. Well, y'all have fun? Yeah. -What did you see? -Old movie. You wouldn't have liked it. Okay. Uh, you make any more plans? He wants to take me out after school, go get some ice cream. Ice cream. Sounds fine. Good night. -Mom? -Yeah? I love you. I love you too, sweetheart. I told that man, my land is not for sale. So I don't know what else I can say. You hear me? Well, she told me that you had-- Tell Moss and Eddie that she heard the wrong thing, - Okay, but she said... - I ain't going nowhere. - Goodbye. - All right. - Everything all right? - -Yeah, everything all right. That Mill's boy is buying up all sorts of property around here so he can build some condominiums or some shit. He ain't buying my land from under my feet. Just like I told his dad 30 years ago to pound sand. Now sure as hell I can tell his hole chasing son "No." You tell them, Levi. Screw that guy. Thank you. Why am I not surprised that we both love pistachio? Everything a man could want. - Good water and grass. - And plenty of it. I've always wanted to try fly fishing. Boone takes me sometimes. Do you believe in God? I do. I like Heaven Can Wait. So do I. I took a train trip once. That's cool. Never been on them. Trains still come through here? Sometimes. Don't worry. Phoebe and I always walk on the tracks. Okay. Please tell me you've seen Stand By Me. - Of course, I have. - Yes. Hey, Mom. Do you want to watch a film? I mean, a movie. No, not right now. Aaron. I need to talk to you about something. I have some bad news. We don't have anywhere to go if we lose that house. You've seen how much rent's gone up around here? -Well, did he say when you had to be out? -He didn't. - Fuck a duck. That's not right. He warned me a year ago we couldn't live there forever, but... He didn't say there was any real plan in the works. Not one word. Well, I know for a fact that he can't tell you have to move out until he gives you time to find another place. Because that is a law. He knows you have a son, right? Yeah, Sugar. He knows I have a son. Okay. Okay, here's what we're going to do. You're going to go get that son of yours, and you're going to come down to my house and you're going to live in the back of it until you find a place to stay. And come on, my mama doesn't leave the room. She's deaf as a post and she can barely see. You won't even know she's there. Okay? Come on. You're sweet. You have people who care about you. You girls get back out on that floor right now! Those pies ain't going to sell themselves. And close that dog on door. Freezing my nipples off. Come on, Avery. Your nipples froze off a long time ago. -Hey. -Hey. -Why were you in homeroom? -My mom made me late. -What happened? -We have to move out of our house. -Well, that sucks. -Yeah. When? I don't know. What are you going to do? -Aaron. -How am I supposed to know what we're doing? We're moving. Everything's going to be roses and sunshine. If you were a young Cherokee, you'd have to kill an Indian to gain any respect. That ain't what today is about. Animals ain't our enemies. Squirrels ain't stupid. They are quick as shit. So when you see one, rise up, trust your eyes, and lead it by a good foot. And don't shoot a white squirrel. Whole town will be all over our ass if you shoot a white squirrel. I know. It's illegal. We learned about it in school. So you did, huh? -They teach you about the Nunnehi? -The None-a-what? The Nunnehi. They're, uh, the little forest folk that the mountain Indians left behind. In Cherokee, Nunnehi means people who live anywhere. They're out there. Out there watching. You believe that? I don't know. Don't shoot one of them little fellas. They are bad luck. Right there. Right there. Got him. Damn, that's a good shot. Good shot. You did it. He's dead? Dead is the doorknob. Here, this is for you. It's time for you... ...to learn how to clean the kill. I don't want to move away. Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not going to let anything happen to you, okay? Let's get in the truck. Pete, what's the story of this Mills guy? Is he pretty big stuff around here? Brad or his dad? Brad, I guess. - Not a bad guy. - Yeah? Yeah. Considering, I guess. - Hm. - Comes in every once in a while. With his wife. - Wife? - Camilla. Went to school with my, uh, big brother. -She's quite a looker actually. -Hmm. - Yeah. - Camilla. Yeah, I like that name. What about you? What does your wife do? Oh, um, she's a film producer. Huh? Wow, Very cool. - Is it? - Yeah. Everyone loves movies. How about you? Uh, I'm a film director. - No shit. - No shit. Huh, you guys are quite the power couple. - Hardly. - Anything I would know? Probably not. - You guys have kids? - No. Really? Must be, uh, too busy making movies? Guess you could say that. I got to make a call. Hey, sweetheart. You must be out. But I just wanted to check in with you, and I hope you're doing something fun. Hmm. And tell you that I love you. And, you're not home. And that's all I wanted to say. ♪ That's why I'll call you later ♪ ♪ Call you later ♪ I love you. Do you think you'll have to change schools?

Hey, champ. -Champ? -Shut up. Hi, Mr. Aaron's Dad. Hi, Phoebe. I won't keep him long. Promise. Everything okay? Yeah. Why? You didn't return any of my texts. My mom didn't tell you? Tell me what? We have to move out pretty soon. What? Mr. Mills is tearing down our house to build something on it. No, she didn't tell me that. Wow. Sorry to hear that. Can I go now? No way. There must be something I can do to help. It's not your problem. Hey. I'm making it my problem. I'll talk to your mom, okay? Okay. Hey, Ginny. For the record, I don't smoke around, Aaron. -That's none of my business. -You're right. -I just want to talk to you for a second. -Look, I got to get home. I talked to Aaron this morning. -He told me what's going on. -Did he? Well, there you go. Life sucks. - What else is new? - Okay, but hang on. - Hang on, Ginny. - I got to go. Ginny. Look, I didn't come all this way across country for nothing. I care about you, and I care about Aaron. And so that's why I'm here. Let me help you. That's super sweet, Sidney. No shit, it is. But what can you do? Really? What can you do? You buy us a house? Move us in with you and your wife in Hollywood? - I bet she'd love that. Look, I got to go. - I don't know. Okay? I got to go. Oh! Shit. You all right? I just got bad cramps. - How often does that happen? - Shit. No. No, it doesn't, okay? I just... Don't worry about it. I'm fine. - I just need to go home. - Okay. I am worried. Okay? Okay. - I'll help you. - Okay. Thank you. Sidney. I'm pregnant. Okay. Okay. Her life is one big disaster. Nothing like a disaster to sort things out. What if my favorite films doesn't help? Of course, it does. You see everything as a movie. Do I? Don't you? If you say so. Remind me to tell you that I... You looked into the heart of an artichoke, yeah. I'm going to hang up now. Of course, you are. Hate losing arguments. Are you sad we didn't have a child? Sidney? Sidney? Did he say what he intends to do with the land?

Katharine Hepburn, The Lion in Winter. Oh, shut up with your movies, okay? Look, Sidney, I never took one penny from you. Not one. And look at Aaron. You said so yourself. Look at him. I didn't need you to raise him. So what the hell makes you think that I need you now? -I am not your damsel in distress. -But... Okay. What? What do you want to say, Sidney Granger, big-shot asshole?

Yeah, I'm okay. What do you want? Don't you yell at me, Sidney. I'm not yelling at you. Look, uh, I got to go. And leave Aaron alone. He's falling behind in school. You did your good deed. You should have a clear conscience. Go home to your wife. I'm sure she must miss you. Not so sure about that, okay? I looked you up online.

I have rights, and you know I do. You can't treat me like I'm some piece of trash because I ain't laying down like my momma did. When my daddy was killed and you all looked the other way. Hey, that's not how that happened. I told you I got to pee. Shut up, Lewis! You just keep lying to yourself. You didn't get a lick. Rosebud Wilson living it up in Jeter Mountain like nothing ever happened. You know what? Fuck you all. I will not be dragged out of my house until I got someplace to take my son. - So if you got any bright ideas, Sheriff, I am all fucking ears. How that take, Sheriff? Shut up, Lewis - Ginny! - Not now, Boone. - What the hell was that all about? -Not now! Hey, Hey, Come here. Ever since that Hollywood asshole got here, you and Aaron act like I ain't nothing. Let go of my wrist, huh? -Who you think that... -Let go of me, Boone! Sorry. By the time that man knew I was gone, I was 200 miles away. Never did regret that decision. I bet it was hard to leave home though, no? No, I couldn't wait to get out of that backstabbing holler. -Gee... -He ever try to come get you? Rufus? Get me? He had about as much get as a floor mop. And besides, he knew I'd knock the snot out of him if he came after me. You just give yourself a little bit of breathing space, honey. Besides, I love having you and Aaron out here. I, I like your company. That is real sweet, Sugar. - Don't think I ain't appreciate the offer. - -Well, then what? I don't know what. I always taught Aaron to stand on his own two feet. I want him to see me handle things, no matter how difficult they are. I, I think it's important for him to see that. The church has some real cute little houses over in Arden. He'd have to move schools, but... It's just how it goes sometimes. Well, if you don't mind changing school, my kid's sister, Rosalie, she has the coziest little guest house behind her place down in Smyrna. And I'm sure she'd just love to have you and Aaron there, too. -I'll go call her right now. -What am I going to do in Smyrna? Well, the same things you do here. Get a job. The people who wouldn't hire you would be dumber than a box of rocks. It'd be a good place to have your baby. And Rosa makes good cheese grits. -Better than yours? -Please, don't be silly. Well, I can't up and run off to Smyrna, Sugar. Why not? Because I would miss you too much. Sugar? Where's my hot water? -I'm coming, Mama. -I'll bring it to her. And then I'm going to get going. -Where are you going to? -Ah. I'm going to go listen to some music, I feel like getting out. Hey, Virginia.

I have a meeting to go to. What kind of meeting? Just a meeting, now. Job interview kind of one. For what? That's too many questions. Have a good day at school. Mm. Bye. Okay. I know I don't have that form, but is there anything else - I can give you? - -No, there's nothing I can do for you. -I'm sorry. -Any-- Anything that I-- -No. -Please, I just, um... -Maybe I can show you proof of my bills-- -I would love to be able to help you, but there's nothing I can do for you. Oh, God. All right, fine. We got one place in Dana. -Okay. -I don't know how you feel about that, but not until 2021, so just stay in touch. All right. I wish you the best of luck. -Thank you. -All right. Stay in touch. Our heart goes out to you and your son, Miss Ginny. Oh, just Ginny. Oh, now, moving is never easy. You know, our parishioners, uh, who through no fault of their own fall into the transient way, always land on their feet, thanks to a whole lot of prayer and the grace of God. Amen. Hallelujah. But we have very strict policies on our mission outreach properties. Yeah, I read the rules online. I just... I thought that the Church might consider my unique circumstances, and there might still be a way to apply. Hmm. I see. Well, you are correct. There is a way. And how old is your son Aaron? He's ten. Aaron's ten and he'll be eleven next month. Baptized yet? -No, he, he's not. -Well, we'll bring him on -down to the river this Sunday. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. There's a picnic after. He'll love it. I'll, I'll keep that in mind. And who's Aaron's father? Uh, his name is Sidney Granger. He lives in California, uh, but he's very active in Aaron's life, and he will, uh, he would, he would probably be more than happy to vouch for me as a reliable mother. And is he the father of your new baby? No, sir. Um, he is not. I see. And does Aaron know his mother is pregnant? No, I, I haven't told him yet. Hm. That's good. Why is that good? Well, we think the best thing for you would be to put your baby up for adoption, and that's going to be a whole lot easier for you if Aaron doesn't have his hopes up for a little baby brother or a baby sister. We suggest you're not telling him until it's absolutely necessary. Mm-hmm. Only when you have to, okay? Now we have several loving, married couples in our flock that would just be over the moon to relieve you of your birth. Oh, stop. Just stop. What is it, dear? You people. - Well, speak, darling. - Just stop with the darling and the dear. God. - Well, what is it? -Well, it's that I don't think you're really listening. I don't think you really care. -Now the Lord-- -Stop. The Lord? You do not speak for the Lord. None of us do. Look, I am asking for your help. -You all knew my mama. -Yeah. She never missed a Sunday. She took her faith with her until the day she died. And as someone who has lived in this shithole town my entire life, and it's getting kicked on my ass by that land grabbing son of a bitch who you all take money from without batting an eye, well, my son and I need help. Okay? We need a place to live while can just figure out what is next. And your answer to me is to get rid of my baby? Well, you don't care about me, or Aaron, or my baby. A burden? God. I mean... What a crock of shit. I made a mistake coming here. You don't have love in your hearts. Stop lying to yourself. Hey, good looking. Hey. So it's true what they say about small towns. Yeah. You can't hide from no one. I hope you're not hiding from me. No. You okay? My daddy died right there, on that sidewalk. He was a drunk who loved to fight and... ...one night he started in on the wrong guy. Former boxer from backup in the Meathouse holler. Punched him square in the jaw and knocked him out on his two feet. Fell and hit his head on that post. He never woke up. Shit. Sorry, Ginny. What happened to the boxer? Nothing much. Disorderly conduct. Everyone said my daddy had it coming. That him and Rosebud Wilson were arguing over a bit and it got out of hand. Rosebud Wilson. Name of the boxer, that no good, piece of shit. Rosebud Wilson. Wow. They named a street after him. Because he won a couple of pro fights. God, believe me, it was not easy to move into that house. But I couldn't pass up the low rent. Kind of cruel irony, huh? Yeah, that's an often misused word, but you just nailed it. Were you and your dad close? We were. My mama was sick since I was about nine, so he did most of my raising. You know, he taught me that... ...I could take care of myself and... ...that I would do something with my life. And then I didn't finish high school because I had too much to do at home and... I mean, now look at me. Well, your daddy must have done something right. Taught you to stand up for yourself. And you are. You're going to be okay. Thank you. When you head back? Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? Got to get back to work. I ain't never been on a plane. Neither has Aaron. -Well, I'd love for you to come visit me in Los Angeles. -Hmm. Fat chance of that. You want to come over tonight? -See him before you go? -Sure. Yeah. Maybe I could come around and sample some of your chili. I don't make chili. -That was a movie reference. -Oh, yes. -I've caught one. -You clearly didn't get it. Of course it was. You okay, Mom? Yes, sweetheart. -Look, I... -What's wrong? I need to tell you something. How's the rewrite coming? It's not. Well, back in the freezer? Can't. We're not going to make our deadline. Could really use your help. I've been up all night. I for belong in showbiz. Orson misses you. Seems like you got pretty attached to Aaron. - That's great. - -Hey, uh, honey, I got to go. Hey, dinner will be ready soon. Dad's joining us. I hope that's all right. Whatever. Sally, put your phone away. Not going to tell you again. I'm going to go outside and have a smoke. Finish up, girls. Boone? Ah! So I expect to know about how's school going. You let me know. Right? Okay. And you two can email and text as much as you like. I know, Mom. Go on. That's pretty good. You sound surprised. - I kind of am. So do you want to come visit me in Los Angeles? Aaron. -It's all right. -No, it's not. Aaron. Answer your father. What's the question? Uh, if you want to come visit me in Los Angeles, maybe tour the studios? Sure. Okay. I'm sorry. He's mad at me, not you. I, I understand. Look, it's, it's not easy, right? For all of us. I get it. You know, I'm starting to see the resemblance between you two. I didn't see it at first, but... I wish I could go to California with you. Well, we will make plans to take a trip. How's that sound? No, we won't. We can't afford it. How do you know what I can afford and can't afford? You know, Aaron... I should have been here when you were born. And I wasn't. I'm sorry. I would have loved to have built you and your mom a house "at the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow." That's pretty. You stole that from John Wayne. You're right, Pilgrim. I did. -It was John Wayne? -You don't know anything. Aaron. Don't talk to your mother like that. Yes, sir. Aaron? Why don't you tell your dad about the writing contest? I changed my mind. -You said you were excited. -I'm not now. My story is no good. Don't say that. You're in a writing contest. I would love to read what you wrote. -You kidding? -Oh, for fuck's sake. I'm sorry about that. That's one of Boone's favorite phrases. If that kid's going to be a writer, he's got a ton of material. Well, the little brat better not write about me. Oh, you can bet he is. He better not. Oh, shit. I'd love a cigarette. - Do you want some whiskey? - Please. -Yeah. I can't have any but you can. -Yes. Okay. Make for two of us. You know? He's not kidding, though. He wants to go with you and... ...I can't say I blame him. You know what? I'm going to hold off without whiskey. Thank you, though. I'm going to talk to him. Ah, you shouldn't stop. Go ahead and play. -Play me something. -I'm not good. Ah, just got to practice. That's all. Get good in no time. "Sure it's quiet. Sweetest sound I know." The Misfits , 1961. Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, Montgomery Clift. Directed by... ...John Huston. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Yeah. There you go. You got it. That old Willow Creek mill, haunted. My brother and I used to throw rocks up at it. I swear I saw an old lady's face up at an attic window. We peel booty out of there so fast. Well, cause you did see an old lady's face up in that window. That was Avery. That was Miles and Annie. You get your story straight, Sheriff. No. No, it wasn't. Because you usually go on to me, go up there and shoot deer in high school, right? You joshing? How old are you? You sound like your old man. Well, I'm fixing you like my old man. Alright, Avery. What's it going to take to get the last slice of this lemon meringue on this end of my fork? Avery will ask when you ate. Sheriff, we got a stabbing up the Mills house. Sounds pretty serious. One unit on the way. Avery, you better save that for me. Avery, you're a peach. You boys be careful. Why do you have to go to California? Well, because I live there. My wife's there. I work there. But... ...I can make plans to come back and see you real soon. That'd be all right? It won't be the same. Could be even better. I'll be the same, Dad. Probably be living a shitty little apartment with a crying baby. Aaron, listen to me. Go ahead and look at me for a second. Your mom needs you now more than ever to be strong and helpful. Okay? And when your baby brother or baby sister comes along, it's going to be like the best thing that's ever happened to you. You hear me? I'm not saying your life is great right now. But you know what? It'll get a little bit better. But the point is, you have to be the man of the house for your mom right now. Why is that my job? Remember Jimmy Stewart? How he had to grow a backbone in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance? It's kind of like that right now. You know? This is just kind of like a test. To see if you can rise up to the challenge. And I know you can. I know you've got it in your champ. I like Real Bravo better. Me too. Me too. Aaron, I am so glad you reached out to me... ...so I could come. Let's get back inside. It's freezing out here. I live in a castle at the end of the road where no one can find me when I do not want to be found. I've lived here my whole life, but for some reason, I have always felt like I didn't fit in. It is not that I don't like it here. The people are really nice, and the mountains and the woods and the rivers and the lakes and all these things I see when my mom drives me around are really pretty. Mostly, anyway. I used to be afraid when my mom would cry, but I'm not anymore. Everyone cries. My mom is my hero. Aaron? Aaron, sweetheart. Did your dad leave? Aaron? Good boy. Jesus, Boone. You scared me half to goddamn death. Sorry. The back door is open. I'm just worried about you. Got us three bus tickets out of this town. What are you talking about? Where is Aaron? Out walking with his dad. You're bleeding. Are you okay? Yeah, just... - What? - It's nothing. What happened? Cut myself with a circular saw. Could have been a good dad for Aaron. Boone, what's wrong? Could've take care of both of you. We're good friends, sweetie. Aaron's always looked up to you, and you know that. It's a sad... ...and beautiful world, But mostly beautiful when you can just... ...take a minute to yourself, slow it down and breath. And then pour as much love as humanly possible into the people in your life. How lucky... ...lucky-lucky we all are just to be here. Just to be able to love. It's really all we have. Not much in our control, but we can keep loving on each other. Come hell or high water. I think that's what we're here for. Don't you, Boone? I had to do it. Do what? I remember my daddy teaching me how to build frog houses out in the backyard. He'd say, "Here's where you stick your barefoot down in the mud and you pull up the dirt all around it. Then you take your foot out and you got yourself a frog house. Don't you want to... ...fall in love with a girl... ...settle down into a place of your own, your very own frog house? You're not going to have this kid. You know what I miss the most, Ginny? What's that? Not games. -Remember playing this skiing? -Yeah. Capture the Flag. Run leg run. Ponzi. Hmm. Everybody knew the rule. We're not losing right in front of you. Boone. - Boone? - -You should've seen his face when he... Boone! Ah! God! Boone's here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Dad, is everything okay? Boone? Boone? - What'd you do? - -Dad, is everything okay? Aaron. Stay in the kitchen. Boone. Tell me what happened. Where's Ginny? It's a sad... ...beautiful world. Boone? You're scaring me here. Everything was fine until you got here. Sorry, you feel that way. I should kill you. And what would that solve? Nothing, I suppose. I loved her. And we can talk about that. You ruined everything. Boone, drop the knife! Drop the knife! Boone, buddy, drop the knife! Drop the Goddamn knife! Boone. Jesus, Boone. Is Boone okay? Looks like a bus ticket. Aaron! We're coming to you live here in the... Just right outside the park, North Carolina in Transylvania county. As you can see here behind me, the police department is on this.. -Amen! -Amen! Amen! Hmmph. Don't you going to miss all this rain? -No, I'm not. -I thought you were a pluviophile. You're the pluviophile. Phoebe, come in here. Well, I guess I got to go. -Bye. -Bye. Aaron. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you, too. Dear, Aaron, I know this will be hard for you to understand, I have to go away. Don't you for one second think it's because I don't love you. I love you more than anything or anyone in this whole wide world. Your father did the right thing by coming to meet you. And now it's my turn to do the right thing. You're at an age now where a boy needs his daddy. So you go on with him now, and know that you'll hear from me real soon. Real soon, I promise. We lived in a castle at the end of Rosebud Lane, where no one could find us when we didn't want to be found. You'll always be my knight in shining armor. Don't you forget that. You'll have a baby brother soon, and you'll be the best big brother in the world. I just know it." Smyrna next stop. "Enjoy your new life in Hollywood. Maybe one day you'll make a movie about your mama. And I'll be right there next to you at the premiere. Be a good boy and take care of Orson. I love you. You write me, okay?" You want me to mail that for you? Sure. Got one more for you, Carl. - Thanks, buddy. - Thanks, Sidney. Have a good one. Johnny Guitar. Nicholas Ray. You ready? - All right. - Yeah. Let's go.
