Aldo, come on! Go get the bike! Get the bike down, you harelip! Get the bike down for me... or I'll fucking kick your ass! Changuila, let him go! Aldo, get the bike down for me! You retard! I'll get you when you get home! Cristian, help me! Hurry up! - Come on, I can't on my own! - Wait! Close. Close, close. Bend. Arch. Don't touch yourself. Open. Kids, slow down! I'm not sure I'll be able to go to the pool opening. - Everybody's going. - It's right there? Of course. I doubt it would be at the vet's. - That's disgusting. - That cream's yours. He didn't have enough room to make it straight. It looks like a capital L. Everybody's going. He already has 70 people signed up and still hasn't opened. Well, but listen, the turtle thing is disgusting. I know who told you that. Hold this, I've got the cylinders. He shouldn't have built the pool behind the vet's. - Are they water turtles? - No, that's not true. If not, they'll drown. What diseases do they carry? It's impossible. The chlorine would kill them. Chlorine even kills plants. It'll kill them, even if they're water turtles. Besides, they're very aggressive, aren't they? They brought us one from Santiago del Estero. We couldn't sunbathe in the garden. Go get your backpack, it's on the table. Hurry, hurry! Open up. You're going to suffocate. Why are you naked? That's enough, girls. Watch those fingers! Come here! Let go! Come on! Get out of the water! Your hair looks gorgeous. The color is very flattering. Too bad it's fading with the chlorine. - Should I put the dish in the trunk? - Yes, please. - We want to stay a bit longer. - Go on, get in the back. Come on, look for it. THE HEADLESS WOMAN This water is going to be good for your hair. Good thing someone brought you. This water is a blessing. Bring her in and have her sit down. Hi, Olga. - It's pouring! Take her down the hall, to the left. She'd already be admitted for her physical. It's really pouring! For 3 pesos, a cab will take you to the plaza. Not the wedding rings. It's just a head X-ray. Just remove the barrettes and the earrings. What happened? Did you bang your head? Don't move. - Nothing hurts. - That's good. Hold your breath. She's falling asleep. The lady is falling asleep. Ma'am, don't fall asleep. You need to keep the blood flowing. If not, it'll get blocked and you'll be in a lot of trouble. Please, fill this out. Yes, at Emergency. Not my name, yours. Olguita, can you hand me another form? They're right there, behind the phone. Here's the hospital form. Hang on, I'll sign it for you. Wasn't that woman Dr. Berardo's sister? Yes, I thought she looked familiar. Look. An upper one. Hurry up, Nadia! Elizabeth Andrada. The officer is looking for you. Come on out. Come on, behave yourself. They'll prolong your sentence. You'll get in trouble. You'll get the officer in trouble. It's not her fault. Crying's not going to help. I told you. She was in the bathroom. - She doesn't want to come out. - Listen to that cough. Come out, Elizabeth. Come on, Elizabeth. Open up! It's just rust. Let it run and it'll clear up. Good night. Oh, hello. Would you like something to eat? No, I'm okay. You were really exhausted. You must be hungry. Would you like a roast beef sandwich? Maybe some tea. Vero! What are you doing here so late? I wanted a cup of tea. What's wrong, Vero? Charge it to the room. - Should I take it up? - No. Okay. You shouldn't be alone. I'll tell Josefina to come if you want. Are you okay? Why don't I call Josefina? No, thank you. Did you park in the street? Here you are. I don't want anymore. Wouldn't you like another sandwich? No, thanks, I'm fine. You're tired. Okay, I'm leaving. Didn't Aunt Lala have the same painting in her house? It's identical. Don't stay here. Go on home. I don't have my car. Do you want me to drop you off at the door or at the corner? Fine. Okay. Thanks. It got late and we got stuck in the rain. It was pouring. Driving was dangerous. We were going 2 miles an hour. Where's your car, Vero? Come on, sweetheart. I'll try on the swimming trunks you bought me. Don't be mad. Come on, come on! I'm going to take a shower and go to the studio. You wouldn't believe how we froze. Kind of small, no? I'll have a cup of coffee and go to the studio. Come on, make some coffee. I'll take this out. Do you want me to skin it? No, you'll get all dirty. I'll do it, it's no trouble. Okay, but don't cut yourself. Rinse it a little. Some coffee? There's some already made. Over there. Are you going into town today? You parked nearby, didn't you? I'm off. Oh, hi. Just a minute, please. They're waiting for you at the office. I'm without a car. I'll call you a cab. She's leaving now. Yes, goodbye. Hello? Yes, I need a car. 40... 60... What was it? 405. Good morning, ma'am. To the dental office. The one at 3 Cerritos, yes. It's on its way. I got stuck on the street. It flooded and I stayed in the car. The water almost reached the gear shift. It was quite a storm. It didn't last long, but it was bad. Is this okay, ma'am? They're waiting for you. A nurse from Milagro Hospital called. She says you forgot your car keys and a few other things. Should I send someone for them? I can send a courier. No, it's okay. Michi, go on, tell her. The water is cold and it hurts my teeth. I feel a little... I don't feel good. Do you want me to call your brother? No, it's okay. My stomach's a little upset. Your mom is here. I'll call you later about the appointment. I'll tell your brother to see your patients. It's no trouble. Or would you rather call him yourself? No, not right now. Shall I call your husband? You shouldn't drive. That's not necessary. Thank you. No, you asked me to buy it for your aunt. It's the talcum and a refill. Wouldn't you rather I called a taxi... So you could go home and rest a bit? I'll go to the hospital and pick up your things. Guess who? It's me, it's me. Let me drive. Are you going to auntie's house? Be careful! The bag! I crushed it. Josefina's going, not me. My car's at the mechanic's. How does this work? My car got flooded. Hi, Vero. Stupid girl! I've been trying to get her to rest for weeks. - Give me another kiss. - She should be in bed. Lots of kids have hepatitis. It's very contagious. What's this, Vero? It's nothing. - Would you like a Chinese hair-wash? - I'll do it! - You should rest. - I'm going to the office. - You're going to make yourself sick. - Don't forget the present, okay? There's another leak. One more kiss. That present is ruined. This storm has hurt thousands of people! If it happens every year it's not just unfortunate... ...it's shameful. Do you want a card? I think I have one somewhere. What did I do with the cards? - Ignacio! - I don't know. I can't find anything today. I can't find anything today. Poor aunt, she's unbearable now. Why does everyone in our family go crazy? Tell me of one who has died sane. None. Vero! You really smashed up the car! What a mess! What did you hit? A dog ran out in front of me. It's going to cost a fortunel The 'ladies' are here. Bring the plants, Candita. Don't let them in the house, ok? Don't let them in the house. - How are you? - Not good. You're still sick? - Look at me. - I'm pretty yellow. I don't have any nice paper. We'll stop by a store... ...and have them wrap it. I don't know where she finds these people. All day on their bikes, like guys. Some days I can't stand them. Your hair is disgusting! Yes. Hello. You all know each other. My cousins... ...Vero and Josefina. Sit down, please. After we have some ice cream... ...we'll pray the Rosary... ...with the girls from church. Mother is awake. She's calm, had her hair done. Zula, there's the hot water. Could you do her nails? Did you notice? The virgin is dirty. Her mantle is soiled. You had such a nice figure. A little doll. And Marcos? Well... You were gorgeous. - And those boys? - Ex-classmates of Marcos. Isn't that Federico, Mara's son? What a family of crooks! Look at the skinny arms you had. You're lucky not to have had children. Tell her, Vero. Remember, Lala. Vero's daughters are going to school in Tucum?n. - What are they studying? - Tell her, Vero. Law. They're going to Law school. Oh well, how bold! Look at little Candita! - Is that Candita? - Yes. I never remember Candita. Candita, how cuddly! I don't even call her on her birthday. Okay, okay. The state senators. Look at Gallardito with his wife, what a miracle! They're your relatives, Lala. I don't see Monse?or P?rez. - You passed him. - Good. Who's that dancer? The effeminate one? No, Juan Manuel isn't. And in any case, that's what I like about him. Lala, you're going to end up alone. Those people are different. He's different, she's different. Turn off that waltz! And the little one is different, too. He's not effeminate. That voice doesn't sound like yours. You were so beautiful. Why let yourself go? Stop, stop. Give me the remote! Give it to me! Back it up. What is she doing there? It's Genoveva! It's Genoveva. Genoveva had already died. Genoveva was dead. Vero, I'm talking to Fer. She want's to know if we are going to Angelica's wedding. Who? Angelica's wedding. Who are you talking to? Hold on. Your mom is still half asleep. Your daughter. Angelica is getting married. We're all invited. I don't really feel like going. Okay. What happened to your car? A dog ran out in front of me in the way home. Tell her things are a little complicated right now. We'll send her a nice present. Buy something nice. Use your credit card. Hello, ma'am. The kid who washes the cars is outside. Not the SUV. Do you want him to wash your car? Okay. You'll have to throw away the dishes that were in the car. They're all broken. There's broken glass everywhere. That's without the pillowcases, which are about 40 pesos more. How much is that each? We'd have to put... uh... ...about 85 more pesos each. - Mom, stop. He threw out the tennis shoe. What are you doing? Look at the canal. It's full. Gonzalo, go get the tennis shoe. There's no water. Are you okay? I'll be right back Good afternoon. It's horribly crowded. I killed someone on the road. What did you say? I killed someone on the road. I think I ran over someone. Over there. There's something on the roadside. It's right there, Marcos. You passed it. It's a dog. Wait. Wait. The canal is really full. - There's the dog. - Don't stop. It's a dog. You got scared. It's okay. I think I ran over someone. You got scared. You ran over a dog. You got frightened by the dog. You got scared. You ran over a dog. There, over there. Do you want to go back? It's me, it's me. You're exhausted. I arranged to see your more serious patients. Let's go to your bed. What should I do? - What should I do? - Sleep. Come on, lie down. I asked Juan Manuel to stop by. He should be here soon. Who? Juan Manuel. He'll make you feel better. - He knows what to do. - Ma'am? What is it? Mr. Villamayor is parking his car. We'll be right down. Juanma, we've got a situation. Will you make us some coffee? I'll bring some right away. I'll call you. Look, Marcos... You know how much I've always loved Vero. All of the cousins love her. We've all been very close. Of course, Juanma. Vero had quite a scare. I don't think it's anything serious, - But for her own peace of mind... - I killed someone on the road. What? Vero had quite a scare. She ran over a dog coming back from Macu's. On the road by the canal... ...right by the little bridge before the curve. Anyway, she got quite a scare. - It was the weekend of the storm. - It hadn't started raining. I didn't want to get out. I didn't get out. When was this? The weekend of the storm. But it hadn't started raining yet. If something had happened, I would've heard. The police have to let us know. Don't worry. The noise must've been terrible. It's a horrible sound. Believe me, I know. What can you do? If you swerve... ...you might cross over into the next lane... ...and have a real accident. Don't worry. Nothing happened. Can I make a phone call? That way we'll calm down. You can go. Close the door, please. Chatito! Dr. Villamayor. You're so rude! When did you go? And what did you catch? Oh, shit! A 15 kilo subiri. Let me know, okay? I have 10 brand new lures. Listen, Chatito. Do you have Gordo Flores's phone number? No, he's probably not home. You don't have his mobile? Let me write it down. Next time, let me know. Don't be so selfish. You knew I was busy! Okay. Thanks, buddy. Gordo? It's Juan Manuel. Call my mobile when you have a chance. Rosana is waiting for me. When she's bored, she starts calling people. I'm leaving, too. Don't worry. It was nothing. Just a scare. As soon as he calls, I'll let you know. I'm going to get some of Candita's test results. Hi, Gordo! What's up? Well, I have a situation. I wanted to know if you'd heard anything about an accident... ...near the canal... ...the weekend of the storm. Nothing. Nothing happened. Nothing happened that weekend... Hi, sweetheart! No, we were just getting up. It's raining there? No, it's nice here. We're coming next weekend. They're coming next weekend. What did she tell you? It's late. She's probably waiting. If we're late, I don't know the way. What did I tell you, Candita? Stay in the car! You're never going to get better. You don't listen. Zula, put the bags in the back. I need to get one more thing. That girl should rest, shouldn't she? Yes, she looks pretty yellow. Okay, by 4:00, 4:30, we'll be at school. So come and find me there. The principal wants to talk to you about "Smile Week." - Are there a lot of students? - 100-150, that's all. Mom, it's getting late! We were talking about this and that, and I told him: What were you thinking when you built the pool behind the vet's... ...with all the money you've put into it? What were you thinking? He was speechless. And who will convince Teresa... that he's not letting the turtles loose there? Vero, can you hand me that? I had to stop Teresa from saying that many times. I didn't say a word to Horacio. Even though he asks, 'cause he suspects something. He's got enough with that mannish daughter of his. Turn left at the next corner. Three of these will be fine. For the jasmine, I'll need a little bit bigger one. Yes, I have some. I have some at the warehouse. Changuila! Bring me 3 of the large ones. And one with a bigger opening. The other one. That one's better. This one's nice. It's blooming. I'll carry it for you. I can't reach. Aldo put it too high. Go bring the plants. You'll have to come back Thursday. I'm short one kid. Can't someone get them down? There's one of the kids that's not showing up. And they're too high. We'll come back for them another day. Don't eat that! It's fried! Give that liver a rest, Candita! Stay in the car! Where are they going? They can't drag themselves. Somebody has to move them. Where do they come from? They drag themselves from there. The branches can't move themselves. How stupid. Do you feel better? Yes, I'm fine. It was nothing. Look! There's more over here! Candita, let's go. Come on, girls. How awful! An accident! They're looking for something. There's something in the canal. Keep going. More, more. What happened? The firemen aren't saying anything. The sewer is backed up. It could be a person or a calf. Last year, the canal got stuck with an animal that fell in there. Mom, close the window. There's a horrible smell. Thank you. I'll turn on the air. Try flourescent light. It's much cheaper. You think so? Isn't the light kind of deathly pale? No, it's better. We're leaving, ok? Juanma's coming in for a minute and we'll go. Who is it? It's me, Lala. Are you awake? That's a strange voice. It's me. Would you like some water? Don't look at him. They're... The house is full of them. Shh! The dead. They're leaving now. Don't look at them. Ignore them and they'll leave. I would have preferred modernity. Here you move... ...and everything squeaks. What are the girls doing? Smell this, Lala. Stubborn yet again. It doesn't matter if she's awake. If she's breathing, it's ok. - Look at her! - What is that horrible smell? Could you check the heater? Candita, wait in the car. Go. Come on, Lala. Do something with that ratty hair! Let's go. Let's not infect anyone. Don't touch my feet! How silly! The main valve was closed. We saw the firemen today. Where? On the road. There, on the road. At the canal. Aunt is totally loony today! - Zula, get that boy down. - It was nothing, huh? Thank you, Juanma. Move it, Candita. Rinse out your glass. Not even let here hair get combed. Get down from there before you break your neck! They don't sting me because... Get down! Come over here. I'll walk you out. I put a little stick for the red bees. Nobody's swimming! They didn't even bring their swimsuits. I feel sorry for the poor man. - The water is pristine. - I'm not getting my hair wet. Look, that girl's the vet. Did you see how young she is? Mom, I want to go in the pool. On the pool float and don't get wet. Very young. I'll be back, Vero. We're going to have coffee with a friend. We'll come pick you up later. Ma'am! The boy who washes the cars is here. He wants to know if you have any chores or if not some food. What should I tell him? Ask Marcos if he needs anything. He left early. He took your car. He'll call later. - I didn't know. - What should I tell the boy? Give him something to eat. What is it? It looks like they covered a fountain or a pool here. Look. This little piece. I'm running late. Candita, keep still! That's too heavy for you! Calm down. You've got a fever. I'm burning up. What does a fever have to do with hepatitis? What's that music? Turn it down. Can you go with Vero to the nursery to pick up some pots? - I'll get them. Don't worry. - They weigh a ton. She didn't come on the motorcycle. Vero has the SUV. I'll give you some bags of dirt. Tell her to let me go with you. I'll drive the SUV. You need to rest, Candita. You're too much. I'm bored to death here. I want to see where they found the boy that was murdered. He drowned. The paper says he drowned. The one on the bridge? - Do you like me? - The one on the bridge? I'm talking to you, Candita! Love letters are to be answered or returned. Turn here. It's shorter through the canal. I prefer to go this way. Do you know the way? Yes, it's longer. The rain has done... ...a lot of damage around here. The pots are too high and I hurt my back. Here. See? One, two, three, four, five, six pots. What an idea... ...putting the pots up there! How awful for that family. Almost a whole week... looking for him! Don't worry, ma'am. Next week his brother, Changuila, will be here. He'll help me bring down the pots. 'Cause my back is messed up. I can't keep coming and going every day. Don't worry. Next week he'll bring down all the pots. I'll have the truck ready and prepare everything for you. Can you imagine how difficult... The way he arranged them. What an idea, no? Cuquita, do me a favor. Take this to Changuila's mother. - Tell her that next week... - You're not going, Alicia? You tell her. Those poor people, such a tragedy. Tell Changuila to please come the following week. Can you drop me off at the intersection? You have to turn here. Hello. Yes. Why didn't you tell me you were going to Tucum?n? Yes, she told me you took my car. And the girls? When are you coming back? You're not returning tonight? Okay, that's fine. Give the girls a kiss for me. Bye. Over there, by the girl in green. Where's the way out? How do you get out? She's very jealous. Tell the lady the way out. Changuila, go get some water. Go straight this way... ...and turn right at the corner. And then, let's see... To go downtown? She takes a right here and then...? That'll take you right downtown. You're sure you had the X-rays taken here? Lover boy is here. There's nothing, not even a record of admission. There's no record of admission? How about in Radiology? You can ask, but I don't think so. What happened to you? In the patio, I slipped and fell. Stretch your fingers. I'm going to take an X-ray... ...so please don't move. Keep very still. Hold your breath. Vero, what are you doing here? I came to pick up the X-rays. I already got them. I took everything, don't worry. Go on home. There's a meeting on Friday, no? Yes, I think so. Would you like me to wash your car? No, thank you. Could you give me a hand unloading the SUV? Those poor plants haven't been watered since yesterday. I'll make you some coffee. No, thank you, ma'am. If you'd like to take a bath, there's towels in the maid's room. Would you like a sandwich or something to eat? No, I'm okay. There's nothing. Would you like me to clean the SUV? No, thank you. What size do you wear? - What size are you? - I'm not sure. They're too small. Those two aren't mine. Could you load them again? Hold on, let me water them. Can I take the T-shirts? Yes, take them. Okay, open up. Open up. Bite. That's it. - What's your name? - Carlos. Carlos, open wide. Wider. Good. Blue, 55... ...red 73 and 74. Blue... That's it. With red... that's it. - What does he need? - Fillings and braces. It's just a recommendation, not a diagnosis. Mom? Mom? I think it's your daughter. The edge continues over here. You changed the color! It's... not bad. - Not too dark? - Maybe a little. It's nice. Tell the gardener to avoid destroying the garden. Let's show your mom Angelica's present. Mom, come and see! It's an outdoor heater, for the garden. - For Tucum?n? - Well, at least for two weeks in winter. Hi! Good afternoon! Where do you want to put all this? - In the yard. - Come on, Yamil! Grab that pot. Go inside with them. So you got the car fixed? I was close by, so I had them touch it up a bit. It's nothing. They hammer it a little from the inside. Be careful! Stay close to the wall. You look gorgeous! - Do you like it? - Yes. - You're going to the bathroom? - Yes. Will you wait for me? I'm taking the present and the bill so they can figure it out. It's such a pretty color, Vero! It's your natural color, no? I can't remember. I must be completely grey. Who colored it? I did, at home. You're very brave. I'll wait with the girls. I'll order you a coffee. If you need me, I'll be upstairs. Excuse me. Room 818... No, room 818 was occupied last weekend. I don't know. Check it. No, it was free. Check again. Room 818. The weekend of the storm, when was that? Yes, last weekend, but... that room wasn't occupied.
