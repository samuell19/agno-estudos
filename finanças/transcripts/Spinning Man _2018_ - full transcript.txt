Subtitles by explosiveskull Hillside Police. Detective Malloy, please? I'd like to report a crime. Mm-hmm. Can we talk? Sure. Come on in. Alone? Long night? Yeah. How 'bout some coffee? Do you have trouble remembering things sometimes, Detective? I'll finish up if you want to go. - Are you sure? - Yeah, totally. I'll clock you out. Hey, so, Eric's mom's out of town, and he's having people over. Who's all going? Everyone. You wanna ride together? I don't know. I'm not feeling the whole kegger thing. - Are you okay, Joyce? - Yeah. Well, text me later. Maybe I'll go. Okay. Uh, why did I come in here? I can't help you. Oh, more soap. Hmm. Dare I ask? I'm washing the car. Why? What's the occasion? It's Saturday, and Saturday is the day we get things done. Zelda, honey, will you go help your dad wash the car? Do I have to? Well, it'd be nice if you did. Come on. You can play with Marvin later. Mom said I should help you. Oh, great. Well, grab a rag, and dig in. Yuck, Dad. When was the last time you washed this? Oh, no! Got me! Oh! Gotcha! Gotcha! Gotcha! Get away from my sister! Oh, no! It's Super Dude! It's Super Dude! Can we get a momentary cease-fire? Why? Do you want to get past? I don't know. What do you think? - Should we let Mommy pass? - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah? Okay, well, put the thing down. - You don't trust us? - I trust them. Oh, ouch. - As for safe passage on the way back... - Hey! Hey! Don't you dare. What do you think, Z? She never asked to get back. - She never asked to get back. - I'm your mother! She never asked to get back. She never asked. That's right. She never asked. Did she? Whoa! She never asked to get back. Oh, get her! Get her! Well, that was a great lesson to teach our kids, how to back out of their word. I was just demonstrating the importance of choosing your words precisely. Besides, all's fair in love and water fights. Mm. Did you forget why you came in here, too? No. I know exactly why I came in here. - I'm still mad at you. - Really? Oh, Evan, I swear to God, this house. If it's not one thing... We have a mouse. Oh. I'll call Parsons. I thought we didn't like them. I'll get some traps. No, we're not killing a little mouse like that. You'd rather pay Lloyd Parsons a million dollars? I will sort it out. I've gotta clean that up. Thanks, buddy. This was in Florida, in the park. Oh, this is a good one. Damn it, Irene. They want a recent picture. Christ. You have a school picture, something like that? She made varsity this year. Oh, beautiful. May I borrow this? It's my only copy. I'll get it back to you, Mrs. Bonner, I promise, untouched. Are you serious? Over there, pink top, talking to Pavel. God damn it. Why do all the good ones go into sociology? Maybe you'll get lucky and she'll audit your Ethics class. Hypothetical: a student approaches you for one night of passion. She's beautiful, just your type. She's an adult. She has no interest in ruining your career or your marriage by telling anyone. All she wants is one night. Do you comply? Would she want extra credit? Answer the question. No, I do not comply. Aside from the blatant breach of professional ethics, I have my marriage to consider. Fascinating. I recall reading a certain book recently. The name of the author escapes me, who said whether one experiences guilt is a rational decision. You're misquoting. What I said was, "One's experience of guilt is a conditioned response, which objective reasoning can overcome." I'm saying, objectively, she's hot, and she wants you. Whether you feel guilty about it is up to you. Are you saying you would do it? Of course not. I'm married. Oh, hey. Sorry I'm late. I lost track of time. How was your first day back? You missed nothing. What are you guys still doing up? Daddy! Daddy, there's a crazy person in the woods. A crazy person in the woods? What do you mean? There's not a crazy person in the woods, Adam. The only crazy person's you. Z. What's he talking about? Oh, a girl went missing up at the lake, a cheerleader from Eastfield. Z told him there's a crazy person in the woods who eats kids. Very Brothers Grimm. She's definitely gonna be an English major. You know, I'm worried, actually, 'cause the kids ride their bikes up there. Was she lost or abducted? They don't know. You know, she's 17. She could have run away. Well, maybe we just say no bikes after dark up at the lake until they know more. What are you looking for? I thought you were saving that. What happened, Ev? Nothing. Well, nothing new, anyway. Santos read my book, though, called it extraordinary. Well, isn't that good? Then right on cue, he brings up my enrollment numbers and proceeds to give me his thoughts for 20 of the longest minutes of my life. Why the Chateau? Well, at this point, why not? I wonder sometimes if we made the right choice coming down here. Well, we don't really have much of a choice. To another school year. Okay, here's the drill. Right diagonal, left diagonal. Wow. Come on, ladies. Let's focus. We have to get this down by tomorrow. Have fun storming the castle. - Bye! - Bye. Have you ever thought about going back to teaching when the kids get a little older? No, thanks. Universities are elitist, cutthroat places. 364 days of the year, I don't even think about it. Well, I always tell people Ellen is the smartest woman I know. Hey, how about high schools? Aren't they always looking for, uh, subs? Oh, can you imagine what that mother is going through? She is so young. I hope they catch whoever did it and fry his sicko A-S-S. Hi. Come on in. Anna. Thought I saw your name on the roll. How was your summer? It was great, actually. Um, I went to Greece after all. - You did go? Fantastic. - Mm-hmm. The cradle of philosophy. - How was it? - It was amazing. I got a chance to read your book while I was there, and, um, I was wondering... Like, I know you're probably so over talking about it, but I would love to sit down with you and... over coffee or something, you know, and just pick your brain. Well, I am certainly not over talking about it, but I don't actually drink coffee. My, uh, office hours are on the top there. Okay. Hi, everybody. I, uh, see some familiar faces, which is good. We philosophers are a dying breed, so safety in numbers. For those of you who don't know me, I am Dr. Birch, and this is Humanities 325, the Philosophy of Language. Uh... thought it seemed a little crowded in here. - Ellen Birch? - Yes. Is your husband home? Need help? Uh, no. It's all right. I... Well, I'm looking for mousetraps. Just didn't expect to see so many. I thought I'd just find the old Tom and Jerry kind. Is this any good? Yeah, but they're kinda cruel. The little mouse gets stuck in there and starves to death. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Hmm. But these ones let you trap the mouse, then release it in a field somewhere. Well, it's more than I wanted to pay, but I guess it's the least I could do for the little guy. Do you have a gun? Yes, I do. Can I see it? No, you may not. Why? Well, because guns are dangerous. - Why? - Well, because they are. Honey, let's just go upstairs and play, okay? - But I wanna see it. - I know you do, but you gotta go upstairs and see... Play. Go. Go. Play. Yeah, they're curious at that age. - Maybe you should give your husband another call. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Press okay. - What? - Press okay. Yeah. Thank you. Ellen? Hey, what's wrong? Are the kids okay? Yeah, they're fine. They're fine. Dr. Birch? Detective Robert Malloy. Detective Killian. Officer Antonelli. Oh, hi. What can we do for you? Is something wrong? Do you own a gray 2015 Volvo S60? Where were you? I've been calling you. I... I stopped at the hardware store. What's this about, Detective? Well... girl from Eastfield went missing a few days ago. We're looking into it. Joyce Bonner. Have you heard of her? No. Oh, so she was the girl on the news, right? The... The, um, cheerleader. - Yeah. - What does that have to do with us? Well, we got a report a man in a gray Volvo was watching her the day she disappeared. I'm sure it's nothing, but we're obliged to look it up, you know. Can you tell me where you were Thursday the 28th, about 3 p.m.? I doubt it, and... and my appointment book's at school, so... At school? Oh, you aren't a doctor? No, I'm a professor at Addison University. I can look tomorrow, give you a call. Your appointment book will tell you where you were supposed to be, not necessarily where you were. Yeah, suppose you're right. Whoa, what's going on? Hey, Z, go in the house, honey. Um, on the 28th, that was Z's last day of camp, and you went to pick her up, remember? - Mm-hmm. What camp is that? - Yeah. Wildwood, Route 15. She got out at 3:30. - Yeah. - Okay, that's fine. We'll just take a look inside your car and be on our way. - Of course. - Don't you need a warrant to do that? I mean... Not if we have your permission. Well, I'd give it, but you still haven't said what this has to do with me. Well, according to our witness, uh, the vehicle had a Addison sticker on the front windshield. Uh, well, it could be a mistake. I mean, as my wife said, I was picking up our daughter from camp, and Wildwood's 30 miles from the lake, so... How'd you know she disappeared from the lake? It was on the news. Z, your mom said to wait inside, please. Dr. Birch, uh, this is pretty routine. Really? It's routine to make insinuations in front of my daughter? Wow. Why don't you just calm down, sir? I'm perfectly calm, sir. - Honey, they're just doing their job. - I... Do you mind if we look inside your vehicle? No, of course not. Yes, actually, I do mind. Who's back there? What makes you think anyone is? A presumption based on scenes from television and movies. Well, in the real world, we got things called budgets. We can't afford to have anyone standing around, watching us do our jobs. Now... what time did you have to pick up your daughter? 3:30, give or take. Give or take what? Five, ten minutes. I mean, these things rarely end at even times, you know. It's always 32 or 17 minutes past and... Did you get there on time? - Yeah. - Exactly on time? Little early? I told you. I don't remember. As my daughter is only nine, she's unable to obtain a driver's license, and consequently, I give her many rides. This particular instance did not leave a significant impression. Did you ever meet Joyce Bonner? Uh... - I don't think so. - You could have? I don't remember meeting somebody with that name, but I meet a lot of young people at the college. It's conceivable that I met her. What I'm sure of is that I don't know if I have. When we asked if you'd heard of her disappearance, you said, "She was a cheerleader, right?" Do you remember saying that? Yeah. "She was a cheerleader"? Well, I was speaking offhand. I'm sure she still is a cheerleader, except that she's missing, and I'm... I'm guessing she's not off cheerleading somewhere. Philosophy. "I think, therefore I am," that kind of thing? Well, I teach Descartes in my intro class, but I specialize in linguistics, the philosophy of language. Oh. Um... pardon my ignorance, but what does a philosopher do? What's so funny? Uh, well, it's one of the great questions, isn't it? You might consider philosophy the logical clarification of thoughts. But I'm more of a teacher than a practicing philosopher. This is relevant somehow, is it? We never know what's relevant until we hear it. You might consider crime investigation the logical clarification of evidence. You live close by the lake, don't you? You ever go up there? Yeah, sometimes. Did you ever rent a kayak? No. You ever remember seeing a young girl, 17, brunette, worked around the kayak stand? Uh, can't say that I do. You mean you don't remember? That's right. I don't remember seeing a young girl, uh, let alone a brunette one, working at the kayak rental. I've never been to the kayak rental. I've... I've never sent anybody to the kayak rental. In fact, I've never even thought about the kayak rental until now, till you bring it up. You enjoying yourself? Hmm. Well, too bad about your memory. Right. Thank you for your time, Professor. I'm not under arrest anymore? You never were. We have your numbers, so we'll contact you again if we need you. At my office, please. Of course. Thanks for your help. You're welcome. Everything's fine. I just answered some questions, and then I left. What did they want to know? Uh, well, where I'd been, how long I was there, whether I'd met, um... what's her name? - Joyce Bonner. - Bonner, yeah. Had you... met her? Why would I have? I just told them everything I knew, they thanked me, and that was that. You didn't save a plate, did you? I'm really starved. - A plate? - Yeah. Adam cried for an hour, because he thought you went to jail. You're acting like this is my fault. They just wanted to look in the car. There's a thing called the Fourth Amendment. Oh, my God. A girl is missing, Evan. I know. I know. Has it even crossed your mind? What... What if it was Zelda? What if someone pulled the same macho bullshit you pulled today? Yeah, well, maybe I overreacted. What were you thinking? Well, they were pushing me around. I got defensive. I was stupid, I... I know. I... I just should have let 'em do what they wanted. How is Adam? You should talk to him. - And Z? - She's fine. You should talk to her, too. What about you? Did I scare you, too? I'm sorry. Zeno's Progressive Dichotomy Paradox proposes that before a person can walk across a room, he must go halfway. But before he gets halfway, he must cover a quarter that distance, and so on and so on to an infinite number of decreasing distances. Based on this logic, the man was never able to take the first step. Zeno demonstrated, in a way, that motion was impossible. Mr. Barnes. Here. Do you agree with Zeno? Um, yes. So you will be unable to leave this room after my thrilling lecture is over? Looks like we're all stuck here. Well, I mean, it's a play on words. It makes sense, but it doesn't. Yeah, you're on the right track. A paradox exposes the limits of language. We all know from experience that we are able to walk across a room. It's only in our language that uncertainty arises. Do you have a dollar in the same way that you have a headache? As long as there are verbs like "to be" or adjectives like "true" or "false," we will continue... and this is a quote from our friend Wittgenstein... we will continue to "Stare at something which no explanation seems able to remove." - Yes. - So there's no such thing as truth? Well, let me ask you this. Can I tell you the truth, or can I tell you what I perceive or interpret as the truth, as best my memory will allow? Anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves, so let's stick with the paradox. One crumb at a time. Hi. Am I early? No. No. I'm just getting a jump on these. Come in. Oh, you can leave that open. Okay. How's your semester so far? Hectic. I'm taking 18 units. Eighteen? That's pretty. That new? Oh. Oh, yeah. I got that in, um, Boston over summer. You've got a good memory. I can barely remember last week. Do you remember... last semester? I'll take that as a yes. We don't have to bring that up. No, I... I'd rather we did. Should I get the door now? Yeah. I wanted to apologize. Um, I was in a pretty bad place last year, and... you were... You tried to help me, and I took advantage of that in a really big way. And, um, I want to say that it was a... a moment of weakness, but it wasn't that. It was just a moment where I didn't think, and... I want you to know how stupid I felt and how truly sorry I am. Well, Anna, I appreciate your candor and your honesty, and I accept your apology. Thank you. I just want us to forget about it and be normal. Well, if you're willing to rebuild the trust between us, then so am I. You're such an incredible person. - Ah. - And I mean that in a strictly platonic way. I do. And I actually did come to talk to you about your book if that's okay. Great. Wow, I wish some of my critics read it as thoroughly as it looks like you have. Or even some of my colleagues, for that matter. Come in. Hmm. Good afternoon, Professor. You got a second? W... Well, as you can see, I'm with a student right now. It'll just take a second. Hmm, look at that. You write that? Yeah. Thick. Actually, do you mind waiting outside, and I'll see you in a moment? Sure. Take your time. How long have you known the good doctor? Few years. Nice guy? Everybody here is nuts. I actually have a meeting off campus, so I don't really have time to talk. No problem. I'll walk with you. I wanted to talk to you about the 28th some more. You wanted to, past tense? Have circumstances changed? Ah, figure of speech. I want to talk to you now. Well, you're talking to me. You said you picked up your daughter from camp that day. Is that correct? Yes, that's what I said. Mm-hmm. Is that what you did? Well, considering my daughter is not still at camp waiting for me, I'd say, uh, yes, that's what I did. - No stops? - No stops. Camp counselor said she waited with your daughter for 40 minutes before you showed up. Well, is tardiness a crime these days? No, but obstruction is. And how am I doing that? Where did you get my notes? Found it in a garbage can up by the lake. You sure you didn't stop there, maybe on the way? I... It's possible. I... I-- I go to the lake sometimes. I sit in my car. I do work, look out at the water, and just clear my head, you know? And is that what you did on the 28th? I don't remember. I might have. I might have gone there that morning or the day before. I... I-- I can't be certain. What I'm sure of is that I... I had nothing to do with this girl's disappearance, so... Look, do... do you have any more questions? 'Cause I really need to go. No. No more questions. Thank you. Dr. Birch, your car has been impounded by the Hillside Police Department. The car will be returned when the department... You're kidding? I've been nothing but cooperative. Well, since your statement contradicted the physical evidence... - Contradicted? - ...we thought a thorough search of your car... And this is how you do it? You leave me stranded at work? Ah, listen. I tried to tell you the tow truck was here, - but you had me wait. - You didn't tr... This is unbelievable. - This is theft. - Believe me, I want to clear this up faster than anybody. Now, let's just go back to those 40 minutes. Look, you can arrest me, if that's your intention. I'm not answering another question until I speak to my lawyer. Honestly, I wish you called me earlier. I just thought if I answered their questions, it would go away. That's what everybody thinks, but cops don't ask questions. They plant land mines. It's okay, though. We're... We're in good shape. Paul, I know you mostly handle divorces. - Divorces, malpractice, fraud. - Uh... This town's too small to specialize. I'm just wondering if... you know, are you used to a case like this? Well, do you mean a kidnapping, or do you mean a murder? Maybe a rape, runaway kid, hostage situation? I don't know what kind of case this is, and frankly, neither do they. They don't have a body, a cause of death, a motive. They don't even have a crime yet. All they do have is an uncorroborated statement and a warrant I wouldn't pick up my dog's poop with. You gonna try those ribs? 'Cause I'm telling you, they're gonna change your life. So what should we do now? Stay on defense. You did the right thing not letting them search your car, - because now if they find anything... - They won't. But if they do, we can get it thrown out. Look, this... this isn't some metropolis. When a kid goes missing here, everybody knows about it. The cops need a suspect, fast. They get sloppy. Coincidence put you in the crosshairs. That's the plain shit of it. Good news is all we have to do is nudge 'em to one side. Hey. Oh, by the way, Deb wants to have you guys over for dinner sometime. Oh, great. I'm sure Ellen would like that. Check the stalls. - Huh? - The stalls. Check. You understand that I'm your attorney and any communication between us is privileged, right? Yeah. Then I want to get this clear. You did not have a relationship with Joyce Bonner, correct? Correct. Are you currently involved in or have you ever had a sexual relationship with a minor? No. How 'bout college age? - Paul, please. - Look, this cop, Malloy, he's gonna try to establish a pattern of behavior. - Is he gonna find one? - No, he's not. Look, I... I don't know this girl. I never have. Is that good enough? For me, yeah, but I'm not the one you have to convince. Look, I'll call you soon. In the meantime, try and relax. Son of a bitch. Carrie's not working today? No. Just, uh, press okay. ...closed two lanes of northbound traffi. Highway Patrol is still urging caution. And the search for Joyce Bonner continues, with police yet to announce any developments in their investigation into the missing teenager last seen at Hillside Lake. Authorities are... Don't you think we should listen? Unless it's a headline that says, "Police return professor's car," then no. What? Classmates of Joyce Bonner held a vigil last night for the missing 17-year-old, as police have offered a $5,000 reward for information that leads investigators to the whereabouts of the missing high school cheerleader last seen at Hillside Lake. Police expanded their search radius. The investigation's still being treated as a missing persons case, though authorities are unwillig to rule out a criminal investigation. Traffic is back to normal after a slow start to the morning... Sorry, ma'am. The beach is closed. And if you could just sign right there, please. - The printer working? - Thank you. Uh, the stuff you printed is... is right here. Ah. Catching up on this story. I haven't been following it. What story? Oh, that. My cousin has a friend who is a cop. He said they... they know who did it. You don't say. Well, I hope they catch him. Oh, they will. They're watching him 24/7. Birch, you ready? Yeah. So what's the prognosis? Huh? Your car. Oh, uh, uh, the transmission. You okay? Yeah, just... endured a new form of shame today. I had two students in my 103 lecture. Two. That's nothing. I got that beat. I remember a few years back, I went a whole week, a whole week, and not one person showed up. ...whole week, I'm out there, and I have to... I need this, buddy. Come on. Anyway, You know, I just kept teaching, wrote quotes on the board, you know, whole nine yards. Did you catch the mouse yet, Daddy? No. No, but I put some more food in the traps. Plural? Yeah. I bought some more. Can I go with you to set it free in the field? Sure. We can all go. It'll be a Birch family field trip. You know, speaking of field trips, it's meant to be nice this weekend. I was thinking maybe we could go to the beach. - Yeah! - Yeah. Does that sound fun? Sure. It bothers me when you do that, you know. What? Brush my teeth? No, the trip to the beach, just popping it on the kids like that. What if I had something to do? Then I'd be the bad guy. Well, Evan, I mean, just came into my head. I wasn't trying to pop it or anything. I mean, do you have something to do? No. But I don't know. I just think I should stay around here in case Paul calls or something. Well, maybe it'd do you good to... get away from it all. Doesn't really matter where I go, does it? I'm still... We'll go. We'll get away. It'll be good. Okay. I'm all set out here. Adam, Z, come on! We're going! Super Dude? Is Adam coming to the beach? No, he's got chores. - He's got chores? - Z! Hey, can you feed Marvin? Z, come on. We're going. Hey, what have I told you about going into my makeup without permission? I didn't. Well, where'd you get that? I found it. You found it? Ew. That's not sanitary, honey. I didn't find it on the street. Gosh. I found it in Dad's car. When? When we washed it. It was in the back seat, so I didn't think you wanted it anymore. Yeah, well, I want it. Uh, will you go wash your face? You don't need to wear makeup to the beach. - But... - Just wash your face, okay? Okay. Where do you want to be? Right here? Right here? Maybe, yeah. Why's that? We should take a trip. - Hmm? - A trip. We didn't have a summer vacation this year. We should go back to Spain. Wouldn't that be fun? Go back to our cafe. You know, we should actually move there. We should buy that cafe. You could run it. I could teach English somewhere, and the kids could be bilingual. Okay. You said something to me that day. You promised me something. You remember what you said? Uh... You promised you'd always tell me the truth. What? That was before I went back to school. It sounds like something I would have said. Oh, you mean you wouldn't promise me that now? No. I... Well, I can't actually promise you that. Nobody can. I mean, what I should have said was that I... I promise to always tell you what I interpret and remember as the truth. I like your original promise better. That's the one I'm gonna hold you to. Pizza? Yeah. I'll just put him down. What is it, honey? Marvin's gone! Marvin's gone! He's gone? Oh, honey, we'll find him. How'd he get out? Well, I don't know. Did I leave his door open when I fed him this morning? I'm sorry, honey. We'll find him. He'll be here somewhere. We'll find him. Marvin! - Marvin! - Marvin! Marvin! - Did you look under the tree? - Marvin! Marvin! Marvin! We'll get her another one. She doesn't want another one. I'm sorry. I know you are. She knows you are. It's just gonna take her a little while to forgive you. We were just so rushed this morning. Okay, Evan, please don't do the whole absent-minded professor thing. It used to be cute, and I just... I need you here from now on. We all do. It was an honest mistake. I'm not just talking about the rabbit. I can't move again. Leave that on. I'm gonna stay up. Fine. I'm gonna staple this one. Good. Uh, what was I saying? Oh, well, whatever it was, it can wait. That's the beauty of time. There's always more of it. I will see you next week. ...great. That's great, Barbara. Okay. Thank you. Long day, Professor? Need a ride? No, I'll be fine on the bus. Thanks. Well, I've still got some time right now if, uh, you wanna grab some coffee. I don't drink coffee, remember? Well, they have tea and juice and water. You do drink water? Mrs. Birch. My husband's not here. He's at work. I know. I'd like to talk to you if you have a moment. I get it, but I don't agree. Wittgenstein would spend his nights having sex with strange men in parks, right? And then he would go home and write about language's inability to define things like... like truth and morality. And does his behavior make his arguments any less valid? Well, no, but couldn't you say that his theories stem from fear rather than rational thought? I don't see how. I mean, the duty of the philosophic mind is to rise above the personal and contemplate the universal, right? Uh... What? Forget it. It's personal, and we agreed. Well, if it's apropos of the material, please. It's about last semester. Well, make your point. Oh, thank you. You're spoiling me. How do you like it here? You've been here, what, four, five years? Yeah. We... We like it fine. Uh, it's been five years. Where'd you move from? Evanston, outside Chicago. Mm-hmm. Hey, there! Look who's here. It's my junior deputy. Do you need more help from Daddy? H... Honey, we just... We need some grown-up time. Can you go play? Yeah. Hmm, cute kid. Adam, right? No, that's Super Dude. Big difference. Puts on a cape, he's a whole other person. I need a cape like that. Gets tiring being myself all the time. Well, if I get a chance, I'll sew you one. Well, now you're humoring me. No. I'm politely waiting for you to get to the point. My wife tells me I'm terrible at small talk. I think she's right. I remember the second before, I thought, "This is wrong. You're making a mistake. You're crossing a line." And so why do it? I don't know. It's not like I was satisfying some curiosity, you know? I know what it's like to... Then I read your book, and it hit me. People make the most destructive choices consciously, and then they try and rationalize it with things like, "I didn't mean it," or, "I wasn't thinking," or whatever, but it's a lie. I saw you at the lake the other day. Girl's missing. It's every parent's worst nightmare. Yeah. I've come by to ask for your help. Well, how can I help you, Detective, all things considered? Because I assume you think your husband is innocent. Joyce Bonner is out there, and if she's still alive, she's on borrowed time. If your husband had nothing to do with that, I need to know so I can move on. I've tried to rule him out, but he won't let me. I'm sure he's told you everything he knows. Mm, I think you're a lot more convinced of that than I am. I think that there's this unknown part of us, like the id, that... prefers destruction, even craves it. What we call guilt is just a fear of this unknown part of our minds. Evan? Well, what do you think? Am I crazy? Um, sorry. I realized I just missed my bus. Um, does your offer still stand? We found strands of brown hair in the back seat of your husband's car. We matched them with a sample of Joyce's hairbrush. It came back positive. You're the first person I've told that to. Not even my partner knows. And if you can tell me what that girl was doing in the car, it doesn't have to leave this room. I know why you left Evanston, the official version, anyway. College was a little reluctant to give the details, but... must have been tough. How many years you been married? Oh, 15 years. Yeah. All of them smooth? Oh, hardly. We both had our reasons for leaving Evanston, both of them very different. Don't think for a second you know what they were. Think it's time for you to go. Well, thank you for your help. You have a lovely home. Yeah, I work hard to keep it that way. Thank you very much. Goodbye now. Oh, she's home. Oh, I'm sorry. If I'd known, I would have called her. I didn't mind. Thank you for the ride. Philosophers are a dying breed, Professor. There's safety in numbers. Hello? Ellen? Daddy's home! The policeman came back today, Daddy. They came back again, huh? Hmm. Hon? I've been calling you. Where were you? Why don't you walk Zelda in? I'll carry Adam. I've got it. It's only a finger. Evan Birch. - Hair? - Strands of brown hair in the back seat. It's a match. Well, they must have planted it. Evan, I need you to think. Is there any way this girl could have been in your car? No, not that I know of. What if you didn't know it? Did you ever leave your car open, - maybe at the lake that day? - No. - Pick up any hitchhikers? - No. How 'bout at school? Do you ever give students ride? I don't socialize with the students. That's not what I asked. Um, I did give a ride to some high school students one day. They were doing prep classes here on campus. Three girls and a boy. It was raining. Was Joyce Bonner one of them? Maybe. I suppose it's possible. Do you have attendance records? Uh, yeah. I... Look, I'm late for class. I'll... I'll have a look and see if she's on there. It'll be good if she's on there, right? Well, on the one hand, it would explain the hairs. On the other hand, it would connect you to a missing girl. - Look, I'll call you later. - Yeah, okay. Where I grew up, if someone wants to prove a chair exists, they hit you over the head with it. Yeah. We're done with your car. Sign this, it's all yours. So you can take my car without asking, but you need my permission to give it back? I don't make the paperwork. I just fill it out. I don't suppose you towed it back to my spot? No. You have to pick it up from the impound, half an hour up 35. - I'll give you a lift if you like. - That's okay. I'll get it myself, thanks. Anything else? You don't think much about what I do, but... when you consider it, we're in the same racket. What racket is that? Proof, searching for the truth. Truth hides behind arguments, analysis, reasoning. Well, reason leads us to the truth. It doesn't conceal it. I've always argued that the truth is instinctive. You take this little problem here on your board. The answer seems pretty plain to me. Does it? Well, be my guest. Prove this chair exists. What chair? Where did you go to school? Oh, bachelor's at Seton Hall. JD at Fordham. A lawyer? Did you practice? I did my time in the DA's office. Wasn't my kind of thing. They wouldn't let you carry a gun. That's my youngest, Katie. She goes to school with Joyce. They don't know each other, though. Different circles. Well, you know, we almost put her through that summer program of yours at Addison, you know, the one Joyce went through. Who knows? They may have become friends. Well, it's a large program. Not everybody knows everybody else. Including the teachers and the... the students? Are you questioning me outside counsel, Detective? Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of it. No, I just want to know that, you know, if Katie had gone there, would she have gotten to know all her professors? Uh, not necessarily. The students are limited to three classes, and there are 15 instructors. That's not to say contact's unimaginable. Really? In what way? Well, one could imagine Katie, for example, being caught in a rainstorm, uh, with a few friends, two other girls and a boy, and perhaps a, uh, professor offers them a ride from the library to the student union, and, uh, perhaps while Katie's in the back of the car, she... she fixes up her makeup and... and maybe brushes back some of her wet hair... - Mm-hmm. - inadvertently leaving a strand or two in the professor's notoriously unkempt car. Would that qualify as getting to know somebody? No, I don't think it would, but if I read her diary and it mentioned an older man she'd met that summer, I'd want to have words with every guy she so much as bumped into. You read your daughter's diary? Every page. Before I forget, I found these in your glove box. I wanted to make sure you got them back. What is it? You tell me. I suppose you think I met Joyce Bonner at the Sanders Hotel fountain at 7:00? No. The Sanders is in Chicago. Was, anyway. Closed down about four years ago. That would have made Joyce 13, and I don't think you're that kind of guy. I mean, at first, I thought it was garbage, but then you bought this car here about three years ago, and I know you don't smoke, so I just figured you were holding on to them for sentimental reasons. Shouldn't this be in one of your fancy evidence bags? Should it? Whose writing is it? I have no idea. Is it your wife's? No, it's not. It doesn't appear to be. - Would you slow down? - It looks feminine, the way the letters are all round, almost touching. You know, when a guy goes through AA, he carries a coin around with him, reminds him not to drink. Seems pretty natural, the way you're fiddling with those. Could you stop the goddamn car? You have to know where this is headed. Would you take me to my car, please? Hey, Frank! Here you go. Three-five-six-seven. He'll take care of you. Hey. Sorry I'm late. The impound may as well have been across the state line. Can we not talk about that now? Mmm. Mm, peaches. Perfect Peaches. What? Just looking at your face. Why? Can't one look at another's face without having an agenda? One can, but I have the feeling that one isn't. I want you to tell me the truth. The truth about what? What was she doing in your car? Who? What? Did you think I wouldn't find out that they have evidence of a missing girl in your car? I didn't want to worry you any more than you already were. So you kept a secret, secret? - No. - From your wife? This is her lip gloss, Evan. Zelda found it. What was she doing in your car? I could explain this to you, but I have a feeling it may be too pat for your taste right now. Oh, don't make this about me. I think this is about you, Ellen. You used to be so rational, you know? Things were either proven or unproven, and now you're all intuition and conjecture and paranoia. Did that cop tell you? Is that what you were talking about the other day? Oh, this is just great. Did he ask you to wear a wire as well? I'm trying my hardest to trust you again. You don't trust me now? I haven't trusted you for five years. Okay. I'm gonna save you the anxiety of having to sleep next to me tonight. - Hello? - They found her. - What? - Jesus, Evan, I've been trying you all morning. Fisherman found her. Source inside the police told me she was floating by the dam. What does that mean? It means you don't say shit to anybody, not without talking to me first. Autopsy's coming. Then they'll decide whether to file charges. I'll be in touch when I hear more. Until then, act normal. Act normal? Guilty men hide. Gotta run. Professor Birch. Professor Birch. Professor Birch, if we could have a moment of your time, sir. Professor Birch, if we could just have one moment of your time. Do you have a statement, sir? - Dr. Birch. - I have a few questions. - Professor. Professor. - Professor Birch. Well, nothing like the hint of a scandal to bring out an audience. So many budding philosophers. We haven't a moment to waste. Why the hell didn't you tell me about this? There was nothing to tell. I mean, it seems I was at the lake the day the girl disappeared, and the police have questioned me about it. Because you might have seen something? There may be other connections, too. Such as? Well, she was enrolled in a summer program here, and I may or may not have given her a ride one day with some other students. - It was raining. - Evan, how worried should I be about this? Why? Did you give her a ride, too? You're a member of this faculty. Anything that threatens your reputation threatens the university's reputation. - I know. - Which means I get to hear about it - before the goddamn press. - Okay. The Chronicle called asking for a quote. I sounded like an imbecile. Why? What did you say? That I had the utmost confidence in my faculty and I am certain the police will rule out Dr. Birch as a suspect in this case. - Okay, great. - Evan, - is that gonna come back and haunt me? - No, it's not, Bob. Look, I'm behind you, but I'm pulling you from classes immediately. You... I just gave a lecture to a standing-room-only crowd. Listen to yourself. They weren't there for your lecture. - You can work out of your office, - My work, my commitment... ...but no more classes until further notice. - ...to this university is second to none. - Evan! It's already done. Adam, can you be a big ghost, honey, and buckle yourself in? Hey, honey, um... you remember that day Daddy was late to pick you up from camp? Do you remember, like, anything that he said or why he was late? Oh, hey, buddy. You get a costume? - Yes, it's perfect. - Ah, look at that. What about you? - I didn't want one. - Oh. Why didn't you call me? I would have joined you. They found her. Yeah. Paul told me. Wait. That's all you have to say? What do you want me to say? They're gonna let me know if they want to charge me after the autopsy comes in. Yes. And you said that was a gray Volkswagen. And what time was that? Okay. All right. Thank you. Oh, look at the skeletons. Why does that invisible man wear a Band-Aid? Did he get hurt? Well, it's a bandage, not a Band-Aid, and he wears them so that he can be seen. Candy apples! Could I have this one, Daddy? - Hey, John. - Hi. Me under here. Which one do you want? One with sprinkles? Okay. Let's have one with sprinkles, - and we'll have two with nuts. - Okay. Uh, do you want nuts on yours, Zelda? Zelda? Where'd she go? Zelda? Zelda? Zelda! Adam, will you stay here with John? - Will you keep an eye on Adam? - Sure. Zelda! Zelda! Zelda, what are you doing? Will you stop that girl? - Hey, whoa, whoa! Where's the fire? - Watch where you're going! What the hell are you thinking? - Just a second, sir. - This is my daughter. Is that true? Is this your father? No. Zelda Frances Birch! Settle down, sir. I will not settle down. I... This is my daughter. I am taking her home. She's in a lot of trouble. Sir, I need you to step back. Is that clear? Zelda? That's your name? Okay, Zelda, I want you to tell me the truth. Is that your father? I need to see your ID, sir. This is unbelievable. I... I don't have my ID. Okay, in you go. Up you go. Help him put his belt on. There you go, sir. Sorry for the confusion. You can't be too careful these days. - Is that what you call this? - Oh, come on, Evan. I've got all night, young lady. A shrug's not gonna cut it, I'm afraid. I'm sorry. You've hardly said two words to me all week, Zelda. I know everything's a little crazy at the moment. Is that what's bothering you? No. Well, what is it? Promise you won't tell Mommy? Your mommy and I don't keep secrets from each other, okay? But if you tell me what it is, I'll decide if she needs to know. She asked me about that day you picked me up from camp, when you were late. Z, I need you to be honest with me, okay? Completely honest. Do you think I had something to do with what happened to that girl? No. Oh, good, because I didn't. You know me. I wouldn't hurt a fly. Autopsy just came in. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Is Evan Birch home? It's Detective Malloy. They had an event tonight at the university. All right, let's do it. It's only a faculty party. It'll be fine. We should figure out what we're gonna say. Well, just the truth. It's outrageous we're being strung along, and hopefully everything will be cleared up soon. We're hanging in there. It's outrageous how we've been strung along, but everything will be cleared up soon. Let's hope so. Situations like this tend to show our real selves, you know? I'll have a Chardonnay and a scotch and soda. And actually, I'll have one for the road. Double, neat. It's criminal, what they're putting you through. You can sue, you know. One battle at a time. I think the most important thing is we gotta get Evan back in the classroom. What do you mean? Here you are. They pulled you from classes? I think I spoke out of turn, buddy. Sorry. - Until when? - Uh, spring. The... The second coming. Who knows? Hey, Barbara. You look fantastic. Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. - Sorry. You having fun yet? When were you planning on telling me? Oh, wipe that stupid smirk off your face. What? What? When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me? Frankly, I think it's the least of our problems. You think our livelihood is the least of our problems? Listen, listen, let's just finish our time here, and I promise we can fight about this when we get home. No. I'm going home now. Why? So you can finish interrogating Zelda? - Interrogating? - Well, what else would you call it? Has that cop deputized you yet? - Ellen. - Let go! Ellen, listen. Just relax. Have a drink. - Sit down, please. - Why? To give everyone - a better chance to gawk at us? - No. It's outrageous how they're stringing us along... - Ellen. - but everything's gonna be cleared up soon! Do you hear how ridiculous that sounds? I hear how ridiculous you sound. Will you please calm down? I'm sick of being calm! Under a bit of pressure lately. Ellen! What's gotten into you? - What's gotten into me? - Yeah. Just go back in there, and peddle whatever jolly bullshit you want, Evan. I'm going home. All right, so that's it? Things get tough, and you just leave? Whatever happened to for better or worse? Oh, you're gonna lecture me on keeping promises? What's that? I found it, in your desk. Who wrote it? You found it, as in it magically appeared, or you went looking through my desk? Oh, no, no, no. I searched your desk. I searched the whole, entire house. Who wrote it? What have I ever done that's made you so distrustful? - What have you done? - Yeah. You know exactly what you've done! Evanston? Really? God, for the millionth time, nothing happened. Well, I saw you! I saw you fucking in your office! I never fucked her in my office! You know what you don't understand? I don't even care that you did it anymore. I don't, but it's the lie. You've been telling me, you've been telling yourself nothing happened for so many years, I think you actually believe it. And I'm terrified about what else you could convince yourself of. Press okay. ...not like I was satisfying some curiosit. - Can I have a scotch? - You got it. Have you got a telephone I can use? Detective Malloy, please. I'd like to report a crime. Mm-hmm. Can we talk? Sure. Come on in. Alone? Long night? Yeah. How 'bout some coffee? What did you do there? Uh... You're a tough man to track down. Where have you been? Do you have trouble remembering things sometimes, Detective? People and places, sequences? I've read a lot of studies on it. It's, uh, it's fascinating. You know, m... memory is really the least reliable function of our brain. I mean, it's reliable in that it reinforces one's concept of self, as opposed to providing an... an accurate account of past events. Is this gonna be on the test? I had a student once when I was at Evanston, Carol. We, um... - we had an affair. - Mm-hmm. Her parents threatened to sue the university, I think. Ellen was pregnant, and, uh, I resigned, and we moved here. But I also remember that nothing happened. She tried to kiss me. I said no, and she got angry, and she told her parents that we slept together anyway, and that's... that's why we had to leave. But I don't remember which one actually happened. I can't prove either, and, uh, and without proof I'm... I migh... I might have killed that girl. I saw her that day at the lake. I... I went over to... to see he. She... She remembered me from, uh, from a... a ride I'd given her once, and, uh, she knew a lot about me. She'd read my book. She had a crush on me. She asked if I wanted to take a walk. She knew an old trail around the dam. I said, "Yeah, that'd be nice." We were alone. It was quiet. The view was beautiful. No one had looked at me like that in a long time. Things got a little heated. And... I tried to hold her arms... so she couldn't move, j... just to keep control. I mean, she... she tried to push me, and she ran. I chased after her. I... I didn't want her to get the wrong idea. She lost her footing. She... She fell and hit her head. I panicked. I... I didn't know what to do, and I pushed her in. I mean, it wasn't on purpose. - None of this was... was on purpose. - Evan! The washrooms are around the corner if you want to splash your face. Am I under arrest? No. Read that. It's the final autopsy report. You didn't kill Joyce Bonner. She fell off a cliff on the opposite side of the lake. It was an accident. And she wasn't found by the dam. That was misinformation we leaked. The autopsy shows she broke both her wrists, probably from trying to slow her fall. Her neck was broken. The fall killed her instantly. That's why we were trying to get you in here. I d... I don't understand. - I just confessed to you... - The case is closed. She never hit her head on a rock. There's no evidence of any intercourse or a struggle, no skin under her fingernails, no bruises where you grabbed her. I could go on. I'm sitting here telling you that I killed her. Can you prove it? Because I sure as hell haven't been able to. I know you were there that day. I know she was in your car, and I know about your history with students... but humans leave traces, fibers from clothing, skin fragments, footprints, and there's no trace of you beyond the scribblings I found in the trash can. There's no proof you did anything more than you told me from the star, lose track of time on your way to pick up your daughter. There's no proof you even saw Joyce Bonner, and without proof... The department thanks you for your cooperation and, uh, apologizes for any inconveniences. I'll have a patrolman drive you home. You're letting me go? Look, I'm not a priest. You want to screw college girls in the woods, go ahead. You're not the first, and you won't be the last, but don't look to me for absolution or forgiveness. I'm no shrink. I'm like you, someone who looks for proof. And when I find it, I sure as hell hold on to it tighter than you. Let him sleep it off, and then drive Mr. Birch home. His family is waiting. I could use a drink. Daddy's home! Ah, hey, babies. Oh. We caught him, Daddy! You caught who? His name is Herbie. Can we keep him, Daddy? Please? We'll keep him in Jinx's old cage, and I'll take care of him. I promise. What does Mommy say? I said we needed to make the decision together. Why don't you take him upstairs, and we'll talk about it. They, uh... They've closed the case. It was a... It was an accident. She fell. It's... It's all over. What? Why aren't you happy? Well, what Malloy thought never worried me. What happened to your hand? Ah, it was stupid. I... I got drunk, and... I would understand if you wanna leave. Well, that's no great feat of understanding. Ah, Ellen, please, I'm... I'm trying to apologize. I don't want an apology. What... What do you want? I want our life back. I want our marriage back. I want all the secrets we've ignored for the past five years out in the open. Open it. Whatever it says, whoever it's from, just open it. There's no starting over. We tried that moving here. We can only go forward, either together or apart. You can't change what you've done, can't change that I stood by and I watched you make choices, even though you knew they could destroy everything that we've built. Ellen, whatever you decide, I promise you I will never lie to you again. I will always tell you the truth. Yeah. Always the truth... not what you interpret. I love you. Anna? Anna? No. Anna? Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna. Anna. Anna, wake up. Stay the fuck away from me! Anna! Subtitles by explosiveskull
