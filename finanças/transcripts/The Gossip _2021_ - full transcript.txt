If you don't want to, I have a long list of applicants. No, sir! I'll do it, sir! BEWARE OF DOG Excuse me. Anyone home? Surprised? Hello, sir. - I'm the… - New staff? Yes. Stop right there. 36.2˚C. Clear. - No need for a mask. - Okay. - Your age? - I'm 24, sir. Served in the army? Yes, sir. Are you in college now? Yes. But I took a year off to prepare for an exam. A civil service exam? Something like that. Are you a quick learner? What's your work experience? I worked at various places. Stores, chicken pubs, and gas stations. - Then you must have quick hands. - Yes. I work here too. Ah, really? Know what we do here? I heard it's providing customized care. Right. There's a VVIP lying in bed upstairs. A VVIP? You know, Chairman LEE of S Group. Really? - Never seen a chaebol before? - But... Didn't he pass away recently? You believe everything on the news? How naïve. Huh? Listen. I'll only explain it once. Follow me. - Watch the stairs. - Okay. It's not him. You believed me? So naïve. He's similar. Biologically, he's as good as dead. If he's legally dead, mega inheritance and gift taxes will have to be paid, so he can't die even if he wants to. He owns over 100 condos just in Gangnam. His son ran off to the Virgin Islands from tax evasion charges. A steward looks after this place. - You spoke to him on the phone. - Right. Our job is to make sure this living dead never really dies. Even if he dies, he must be brought back to life. Got it? Huh? Watch. Check his diapers frequently. He pooped again. He doesn't even eat! Use baby wipes to clean. Next, dry him off. Then use baby powder. Six times. Got it? Otherwise, he'll get a rash or bedsores. Get a new diaper. Grab and lift. Grab and lift. And put the diaper on. Make sure you throw out the diaper trash regularly. It'll stink. - The diapers are there. - Yes. He lives on IV, not food, so check on this often. Know how to poke needles? No. I'll do it. You give him the medicine. Mix it with water and feed it to him 3 times a day. Pull his head back. Open his mouth and feed him slowly. Smoothly. Make sure he doesn't spit it out. Okay. It's a psychotogenic. Without the prescribed dosage, he could have seizures. A psychotogenic? It's a psychotomimetic drug. It's like a narcotic. Think of it as a preservative to keep him from rotting. Wanna try it? It'll feel good. No thank you. Scared? Give him a 30-minute body massage 3 times a day. The rest is free time. Easy, huh? Yes. Damn. With no cable TV, there's nothing to watch. I hardly ever get data either. Am I talking to a wall? Sorry. I didn't hear you. Jeez. What are you doing? Kegel exercises. It's the best exercise to do while sitting. I do this 1000 times a day for my health. - Studying for the exam? - Sort of. Young folks want to become civil servants these days. Know how much they make monthly at first? Not even $2000 after taxes. When will you buy a car and a house with that? Still, it's a stable job. But the country isn't stable, think being a civil servant is? Money talks, you know. Did you make a lot? Me? Of course I did. I made almost $10 million on coins. I drove around in a Lamborghini and Bugatti. I had my own room at the best bar in Gangnam. Then why are you here? Heard of Kyrgyzstan? A country next to Uzbekistan? No. It's a country filled with hot ladies. It's an oil-producing country, so electricity costs nothing. I went all-in to build a joint to mine Bitcoins 24/7. But the damn government took away private business rights. I lost everything. No way. You don't believe me? Those who've made money knows to make it again. Like those who've tried meat, eats it well. Same goes for women. Ever done it with a girl? What? You look like you've never done it. Don't make a habit of it. You should do it a lot when you're young. One more thing. You should always do Kegel exercises just in case too. Opportunity is a God-given gift to those who are prepared. Squeeze your sphincter muscles, then let go. Squeeze in! Damn. The noodles always come soggy. Is it because we're high up? The delivery guy is rude too. Then order from elsewhere. It's the only one around, pal. Mind if I call you that? No, that's fine. I'm uncomfortable with strangers at first, but you're different. How about a drink for dessert? Can we drink here? How else can we kill time? But in broad daylight? Beer is good anytime. We have beer and dried pollack. Beer is just carbonated water. - You can grill pollack, right? - Me? Good job, pal! It's just perfect. Really? You can't smoke in bars as you drink anymore. - Right. - It sucks to go in and out. That really kills the mood. It's like pulling out at the climax and coming back after peeing. I guess. Wanna call a girl over? - A girl? - Yeah. Know someone? I know lots of girls. Let's see. Da-bin is bitchy. Hyun-kyung is married now. What do you think? Found one! She's perfect. See? But she's no ordinary girl. She's a rare item. Ever heard of the legendary 10-seconds girl? - 10-seconds? - Yup. Curious? Wanna hear it? What is it? Rip me some pollack. She ends it in 10 seconds! The legendary call-girl who finishes off any man in 10 seconds! She became famous among the rich men in Gangnam, and had clients lined up to be with her. Then one day, she got a call from S Group's Future Strategy Office. They develop techniques like that at S Group? That makes sense. But that's not why. They wanted her to help the chairman who's been impotent for years. Oh, that… Yup. She knew this was her big chance! So she made the deal of her life. What deal? $10 million for helping him ejaculate! $10 million? But if she fails, she said she'd cut off her supple nipples. That's crazy. There's more. Once the deal was made, she met the chairman at a place and time that no one knew. When she got on top of him, she got shocked. Why? It took more than a minute to find his dick under his sagging belly. One minute? She quickly came to her senses and worked her body hard to get the money. It's like inserting it in a pile of wiggling worms. Like octopus suckers wrapped around it and pulling hard. You know? Sort of. 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds 4 seconds, 5 seconds, 6 seconds, 7 seconds, 8 seconds 9 seconds, 10 seconds! 10 seconds passed, but there was no response from the chairman's dick. She put in everything she has and used her killer move, fondling the perineum. Turned on? Huh? Ah, no. What is the perineum? Between the scrotum and anus. I see. Know what happened? After 1 minute, 5 minutes and even 10 minutes, there was no response in the chairman's dick. She failed! What about her nipples? Cut off, of course! With her life savings, she got artificial nipples made. But it gets worse. Her hustler lover found her candid pics of the chairman and threatened him. He said he'd send 'em to tabloids if he didn't get $10 million! That's crazy. What happened? The stupid hustler underestimated the chaebol. He got suicided without a penny. Got suicided? She found him dead on overdose. But would a guy who ordered chicken delivery kill himself? Two boxes, at that! I guess not. Anyway, she got hooked on alcohol and drugs and lost all her money. No one heard from her again. But before I came to work here, I bumped into her. Really? She's a bit older, but she's still sexy as ever. She has beautiful toes. I'm strangely attracted to girls with pretty toes. Whoa… Should I call her? Why would she come? I said I'd buy her a drink and got her number. If I call her, she'll come within the hour. How can she come out here? I'll give her the address and pay for the cab. Don't want her to come? Forget it then. If you said you'd buy her drinks, a man should keep his promise. Men are all the same. - The person you are calling... - Shit. See? I knew it. I'll text her. She'll come. It's time for his medication. - Check his diaper too! - Okay. Was it this? Damn it! Should I feed him again? Damn it! She really came! What the... Wait! Stop! 36.7˚C. You're heated up, huh? - Crazy. Are you drunk? - I just had a beer. What is this place? - Great timing. - Hello. What? I thought you were alone. He's a fellow worker. Looks like you're a good size, baby. I'm not a baby. You're cute. Cat got your tongue, pal? I heard much about you. Huh? About what? Don't touch her sore spot right off the bat. We'll talk about that later. If we're gonna tell sob stories, chew the world and end with a bang, I'm leaving now. Okay, okay. Cheers! Come on! So, you're saying a billionaire is upstairs? So what? He's as good as dead. He's totally my style! A soon-to-die billionaire. Money hungry, huh? I'll give him 2 years. I'll save to start a business. What business? A pet café. You'll be a bitch to feed dogs? Whatever. My pantyhose is ripped. With a girl here, things are getting fun. Wanna play the King Game? No way. That's so old school. King Game! King Game! King Game! King Game! King Game! King Game! King Game! It's not fair. It's two men against one. It could end up being disadvantageous for us. Come on. Let's just play for fun. You kneel too. Fine. Get the sticks? Go ahead. - Should I go get 'em? - I'll go! Mix 'em around and around! Who's first? Me! Me! Me! Let's see together. Ready? One, two, three! Yes! I'm the king! I'm the king! Don't be cheesy and tell us to kiss. Of course not. I can do better than that. Number 1 has to send out a text to all the women on his phone. What do I say? Say, 'I want you'. That's not fun. What do you mean? It'll be fun! Give it to me. I'll do it. You never know. One can call you back! Don't thank me later, pal! Wait. Mom, Grandma, Aunt Kim, Aunt Lee... Don't you have a life? I told you it won't be fun. Are you really a virgin? No way! How can he be a virgin at his age? What a somber mood... Hey! At least you get calls from your mom. I've lost touch with my mom for years, pal. She won't take my calls. I think she blocked me. Man, I miss mom's nagging. It's even more somber now. You killed the mood! Come on! Let's just drink up. Cheers! Beer doesn't get me drunk. It just gives me gas. Wanna play truth or dare? Enough with the old games. Actually, I'm really curious. Can you really take out men in 10 seconds? What's he talking about? What lie did you pull on him? What? It was a lie? See for yourself if it was a lie or not. Fine. I'll tell you a secret. But you can't tell this to anyone. You're the first to hear it. I promise. I'm so excited. Let me calm down first. Listen up. The truth is... I killed someone. No way. It's true! If you don't believe me, forget it! Okay, fine. Let's hear your little lie. Rip me off a piece of pollack. A few years ago, while I worked at a bar, there was this guy who always asked for me. He had the hots for me. He was kinda dumb, but cute in a way. So I met him a few times after work and stuff. Still, he was the owner of a company. So you planned to con him? Not to a big extent. I had to move at the time. And see this nose? I needed a reoperation, so I was strapped for cash. So I got a house, a car and a monthly allowance from him. Was he like your sponsor? Something like that. Then one day, he moved in. He said his business was down and fought with his wife or something. It wasn't just a few days. I have my business too. The crazy bastard thought I was his girlfriend! How dare he nag me all the time? So you killed him? Suddenly, the loser gave me a bill! Thinking about him makes me so mad! He said to pay him back for everything! Bastard. So? I said I was broke. I didn't have a penny to my name. Then the bastard slapped me hard! Shit. He called me a gold digger and hit me! You didn't fight back? How could I? He'd beat me to death. First, I begged for forgiveness. - I calmed him down to sleep. - Good. Then the next morning, I drugged his curry. He always has curry after drinking. Shit. I do that too. Now, I can't eat curry. Why drug him? I can't kill him when he's awake. It sounds so real. It's true! Then what? He conked out right away. So I stuffed his face with a pillow. Did he die? About a minute passed, I thought he should be dead and lifted the pillow off him. Then he suddenly grabbed my neck and choked me! It freaked me out! I thought he was dead! I thought if I didn't kill him, he'd kill me. So I pushed the pillow down on him with all my might. Harder and harder! 1 second.. 2 seconds, 3 seconds... At exactly 10 seconds, he shuddered and stopped dead. He even pissed and shit his pants. She really did it in 10 seconds. What about the corpse? After that, I lost all my energy. I couldn't even stand. I spaced out for a while. Then I went and bought a saw, bleach, and a steamer. Why a steamer? I heard steaming and drying reduces volume and weight. I can't lift the heavy thing by myself. Boiled meat, huh? I drained all the blood out, removed all the bones, then steamed the flesh and guts and dried them in the balcony. But... You're lying, right? No. When I came home the next day, the bastard was all gone. No clothes, no ID, no wallet. No trace of him at all! That's insane. For real? I told you it's true! He's scared. Cut it out. Is he stupid? This is so fun! I need some fresh air. - Sure. Take your time. - See ya. - Let's play again. - Crazy. Pick one! Then I'll pick first. Yes! I'm the king! What the? Come on. It's been so long. Are you crazy? Hold still. Let's stay like this for 10 seconds. I get so turned on with you like this. Where's the money? You said you'd pay. Don't worry. I'm almost done here. Just 10 seconds, please? Stop it! - Wait. - What? Did you hear that? Stop. What? He didn't come back in? Wait. Where are you going? What's all this? What's wrong? Wait up! Why'd you turn the light off? I didn't. Maybe it was that guy. What the hell! What the! No! Stop! Go away. Fuck. Are you okay? What the fuck! Shit. Is he dead? Check if he's breathing. Me? Hurry! Is he breathing or not! I don't think he is. We're fucked. Good luck. I gotta run. Let go! We killed him together! You can't run off. There's no we! You guys killed him! Aiding and abetting! Wouldn't the cops consider it as self-defence? Self-defence? I'm not scared of the cops. Think his people will let us off? This is about money! Self-defence or not, I was never here. Not so fast. If it wasn't for us, you'd be dead. This guy almost died trying to save you. We're in the same boat now. Are you crazy? Okay. Let's run away together. I sent my ID and bank info before coming. They have my address and everything. Fuck! Then let's erase all traces of his death. There should be some bleach here. Get a saw. You find a steamer. Leave the rest to me. Why go look for a steamer? Crazy? Let's move him to his room. Grab a leg each. Did you give his medicine properly? Ah… I told you he'd have seizures, if he didn't get the right dose! I'm sorry. Shit. What's done is done. Finish cleaning up here. I'll clean up downstairs. - Oh, shit. - Why? Come here. - Isn't that a surveillance cam? - What? - We're fucked! - Shit! Fuck! That hurts. I paid you a lot to take good care of him. But you killed him? And you bring a call-girl and drink in broad daylight? I'm not a call-girl! It was an accident! Accident or not, what are you going to do! Where is the other guy? What is he trying to pull? Fuck! He bit me again. Shit. I'm fucked. Come down and sit here. Listen up. We're all in the same boat now. Wait. I explained before. I'm not supposed to be here. Actually, this is deemed an industrial accident. I suddenly panicked. What is with you people? I saw you drinking and killing him on CCTV! I don't believe this. Can't you just let me go home? I'll zip up my mouth for life. Me too! Drink up. Rip me a piece of pollack. Yes, sir. As you know, the chairman was someone who can't be dead. Who is he that he can't be dead? I heard it's about inheritance or gift taxes. - Can't you hire good accountants? - No! Stop it. They'll resolve things. - Korea is a tax evasion paradise. - Stop it. What are you talking about? I told you to stop! What? You lied? But we can't bring him back from the dead. Right. I'll say the chairman has gone missing for now until I can deal with his death. Then get me a saw, some bleach, and a steamer. Why do you need that? I'm an expert in that field. It's not something you amateurs can handle. There's an alibi making expert. He used to be a profiler. He was a consultant on "Unsolved Crimes" too. After other star profilers came out, he lost work and switched fields. He makes a lot more now. Really? By doing what, exactly? Ever heard of getting suicided? Ah, yes. He's an expert at that. Once hired, he'll set up the suicide and make up the alibi. There's no need to dirty your hands to get rid of the corpse. Which OECD country has the highest suicide rate? - Korea. - Right. You don't think they all killed themselves, do you? Think all those politicians, chaebols and celebrities really killed themselves? He'll be here in 2 hours. You guys can stay put here. Once everything is taken care of, I'll let you go. I have all your IDs. Don't think about running away. I gotta meet someone to discuss his death. I'll be back. Now, all bow. I think he goes to church. Then pray. Isn't this Buddha? Then just do whatever. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Don't just sit there. Take him and buy me some time. For what? I gotta find something in this house. What is it? You know me. Think I'd come here just to wipe shit off an old man? Then why? I'm working on something. There's no time! It's my last chance. Don't want money? Money? This doesn't fit. Damn it. None of the keys fit. What are you doing? Sorry. I gotta go badly when I drink beer. What's this? Are you really a virgin? I am not! You're cute. You have 'virgin' written on your face. Do I really look like it? Yup. I'm dying to know. Are they really fake? What? Curious? Wanna touch 'em? Really? Damn it. Okay! Damn candles. They could start a fire. Why are there so many restricted rooms? What? There is no keyhole. What were you two up to? Lost your virginity? What's with him? Don't know. I'm starving. I'm getting hungry too. Can't you cook? Make something. How about curry? No thanks. Why aren't you eating, sir? They gave me a general anaesthetic for a recent procedure. I've lost my sense of taste. They said it'll take a month. Maybe it contained narcotics. You know I hate drug peddlers. They're stealing my business. Damn drug peddlers are still kicking around hard. The politicians still can't regulate them. Damn politicians. There's no one with vision. They just see Korea as a business. How is your health, sir? I'm fine besides having no appetite. I don't think my boss will last long, sir. I heard he's being kept alive by force. I warned him not to name it that. An immortal church? What is that? Thinks he's immortal? We have the same mother, but are so different! He's a disgrace to our family. But we've expanded a lot thanks to the name, sir. Claiming he can live forever... His followers will all leave when he dies. You don't get fooled by others. You're fooled by your own greed. Why did you want to see me? We need a successor, sir. You can take it over. And money, sir. You want money? Yes, sir. About $1 million… You can make that with manual labor. Or perhaps until the followers can settle down... You want to park them with me? I'll pay good parking fees later, sir. And please take over our businesses for the time being, sir. I don't need this. I have many senior executives like you. Even if we'll make money, I need a good reason to take you in. The head chef here puts a fake diamond in one out of 100 snappers. It's amusing to look for them. Found it! Damn it! Please distinguish the faithful from those who aren't, sir. That's a good idea. He once cheated me and took a diamond. Sir? It belongs to me. Forget faith, just bring me the diamond. Jeez! Ramen with pollack tastes better than I thought. Have a drink. - Cheers. - Cheers. Soju goes better with ramen. He turns into a complete dog when he drinks soju. Cut the crap. Let's keep playing the game. - What? - Truth or dare. Enough with the old games! What did you two do in the bathroom? What is it? Is there something you're not telling me? No way. Actually... Hey! Actually, what? I'll be honest. I'm not studying to be a civil servant. I'm working to pay off my dad's debt. What do you mean? My dad's business was down and he borrowed money from people. Then he lost all his ties and had nowhere else to borrow from. He took out loans and private loans even in my name. Know how much it sucks to start off with tens of thousands in debt? It's like taking the spoon away from a pauper to die. Lots of people eat with their hands in India, you know. Millions. Stupid. That's not what he means. Mind if I smoke? What I can't forgive the most is that he lost everything to a gold digger, then committed suicide. Who's the bitch? I can make calls and find her. Tell me. What's her name? If he's dead, no need to pay his debt. Just sign away your inheritance. I still have to pay the private loans he took out in my name. Cheer up. That's not so bad compared to me, pal. My mom gave all her money to some cult called Chun-li or Man-li. I haven't heard from her in years. I even reported her missing, but there's no trace of her. I have a sad story too. Your boyfriend's suicide? He didn't kill himself! I told you not to date him. You should've listened to me! What do you know, stupid! See? Money is the problem. If we all add money, we'd have no reason to be here. What? We started with sob stories, so we'll end with a bang? I should've gone home right away! Damn it. Fine. I'll spill the truth too. About what? You know CHOI Deok-pal, right? Who's that? The crook? Pyramid selling? Right. He's the suspect to the biggest pyramid scam in Korean history. I remember! What about him? He's dead. The corpse upstairs is CHOI Deok-pal. Whatever. Cut it out with the damn gossip. Has anyone seen CHOI Deok-pal dead? Well, he's dead now. He's lying dead upstairs. He's a demon who feeds off money. As long as he has money, he'll never die. What? I've been following him for several years. The Philippines, Laos, and Thailand… He already died several times there. But somehow, he came back to life. Isn't that going overboard even for you and your lies? Right! That's totally crazy. You saw that he stopped breathing. Then how could he get back up? Maybe he stopped for just... If he was a normal person, he'd be brain dead with lack of oxygen for a few minutes. Walking is out of the question. He's the devil. He'll never die. You're scaring me. What are you an exorcist? Wait. Then why did you follow him? For a diamond. What? He has a rare diamond. It's too big to even put a price on it. A glowing, real diamond. You can't sell a diamond like that anyway. It'd be a headache to have it. Who says I'd sell it here? So? Where is it now? There is a room I can't open. I think it's in there. The old man will come back to life again soon. Let's get the diamond and run before he does. What are you waiting for? It's in here. - It's locked. - What? Is this a crypt? It's freaky. Damn it. Hold on. Damn, CHOI Deok-pal! Jeez! - It's a fingerprint scan. - Shit. Step aside. Wait! Use your head! Then what? Let's bring him up. That'll take too long. Is it the middle finger? Shit! Get the middle finger! It's the ring finger! Shit. Maybe he's left-handed. He's left-handed! This is the last one. We've heard much about you. Excuse me. 36.5˚C. Clear. Where is the body? Is he decaying already? Change your makeup. It doesn't suit your body scent. It's just baby lotion. That's why it doesn't suit. Here. Have a drink. Do you always have a drink like that before you get to work? No. Do you know who he is? Who? You must've heard about the case. It was all over the news. When Man-li Sect's Chairman YOO's bones were found… That's him. What is he talking about? No way. That's going a bit far. It can't be true. Back then, I suffered from depression and had doubts about my job. Then I came across a book. "Words Become Seeds" by Chairman YOO. I never read religious books, but that was different. So I went to Chairman YOO. I said, "Your book allowed me to positively enjoy my work." I had a spiritual enlightenment. Then I came out on what I did for a living. He said that he was in a rut. He said he needs to die to live. So you faked someone else's bones as YOO's body? Right? I thought it was weird he'd decay to bones that fast. Right. I had to dry the corpse well, so they can't get the DNA. I did everything myself. Whose corpse was it? A female follower of Chairman YOO. She really believed she could be resurrected. I can never forget her. A middle-aged woman with a big dot on her forehead. She was so stupid. Did she walk with a limp? Right! I think she did. So, I had to make the leg bones the same size. After becoming a believer, more work came in for me. And Chairman YOO gave me inspiring words every day. He also personally introduced me to many clients. He has a strong network of people in politics and business. Were you behind the S Group chairman's blackmailing case too? I remember that! It was so weird. I went to kill the hustler at his girlfriend's house, but there was a body cut to pieces in the bathroom. I thought it was a lovers' quarrel and took 'em to set up the suicide. It turned out later, it was the wrong guy. It was some fool who got done in by the gold digger. He owned some tiny company in the suburbs. He got ripped off to the bones, by the bitch, literally. He was so stupid too. Anyway, I took the bitch's boyfriend later and got him suicided. But a chicken delivery came after I was done. People debated whether it was suicide or murder. You could kill yourself because the delivery was late, right? By chance, when did you deal with the stupid businessman? Well… Wait. I wrote 'em all down in here. This is my life and treasure. My history. It's priceless. If this gets out, many heads will be hung. The pollack looks good. Rip me off a piece. What? Stop it. What? Stop, you son of a bitch! You fuckin' bastard! What the hell did you do to my mom! Son of a bitch! How the hell would I know if she was your mom or not! Crazy bitch! Why you! How dare you! Stay put, you bastards! You wanna die! Die! How do you want to die? What do you want? How about poisoning? No, no. How about hanging? Tell me how you want to die. Son of a bitch! No. Hold on. Since your head is hurt, let's cut yourself to death. Okay. First... Let's make a hesitation wound. Damn coward. Got scared and cut your thigh, huh? Thwack! Now, for the main event. Cut your stomach in hesitation! Fuckin' bastard. Damn you! Where's the old man's finger? Give it to me. Fuck. You believed that? There was no diamond from the start. Cut the crap and hand it over! Why else would you be here? Give it to me. Let go! Hand it over or else! Give it to me! How dare you try to make me a eunuch? This is all thanks to years of Kegel exercises! Fuck! Let's kill each other! Fuck! Dad... Fuck. Kill all the bastards there. What the fuck! Hey! Help me. Go get the diamond. Let's leave together. 70:30. No! 60:40. Fine! 50:50! I'll give you half. For real? Yes! The diamond is real! Before that old man comes back to life! Damn bastard. Enough with the lying. Son of a bitch! I'm serious! He'll be resurrected! Fuck you. That's what you get for gossiping. This is worth more than that. Fuck! No! Son of a bitch... Stupid bastard. I said to kill 'em and he gets killed? Damn son of a bitch. You had the key? WORDS BECOME SEEDS I called about the job? Does it really pay $2000 a week? $2000 a week. Sweet job, isn't it? By chance, is it doing anything illegal? No way. Think of it as providing customized care service. Customized care? If you don't want to, I have a long list of applicants. No! I'll do it, ma'am! BEWARE OF DOG Anyone home?
