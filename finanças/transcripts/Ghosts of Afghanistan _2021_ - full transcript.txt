I'm heartbroken about the way things went in Afghanistan. Powerful armies invaded this country with slogans about peace, democracy, women's rights. It was a disaster. Now the foreign troops are withdrawing. Whatever they leave behind, so far, it's nothing like what we promised. My name is Graeme Smith. Canadian war correspondent more than 15 years ago. I followed troops into battle. Spent years smelling the death. The charred flesh of suicide bombers got stuck in the treads of my shoes. I returned one more time before the Taliban swept back into power. I needed to find out how it all went wrong. I was also looking for a way to reconcile myself with the terrible things that we, the foreigners, inflicted on this beautiful country. I've just come back to Kabul and one of my first evenings out, I looked at my phone and I heard that an analyst that I knew a little bit, he'd been gunned down in the streets. Probably because of the things he was saying on television. That was a good reminder about the dangers these days that, I guess, face everyone who dips their toe into politics in Afghanistan. I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a reporter for The Globe and Mail. And I stayed for many years after that as an analyst for NGOs and the United Nations. It was exciting for a kid in his twenties What felt like the edges of civilization. - I had no idea - what I was getting myself into. When I first arrived, it felt like a cowboy frontier town. It wasn't unusual to hear people saying, "Oh, this is like the opening scene in Star Wars. You know? With all of the crazy characters walking around." - everyone you can possibly - imagine was crowding into Kabul In the early years of the war. Today, so much has changed. I've never seen the city so on edge. The Taliban, once defeated, can now strike at any time. People try to go about their daily lives but there's always the danger of a truck bomb or a suicide attack. And when we venture outside to talk to local people and do some filming, we time ourselves to make sure that we don't linger. There's a lot of kidnappings by criminals, the Taliban, and other armed groups. Kabul used to be crowded with foreigners. Now the diplomats and aid workers mostly stay behind the blast walls and the barbed wire that you see everywhere. - In the sky, surveillance blimps - float powerful cameras To watch for trouble. In the streets, posters urge citizens to dial a hotline to stop terror attacks. You know, it's the first time coming to Kabul that I've hired a B6 armoured vehicle. - We've got the bulletproof glass, - the armour-plated doors, - We've got the bulletproof glass, - the armour-plated doors, You can spray the tires with bullets and it'll keep driving. In some ways it feels like overkill but that's the reality now. I happen to know the man in charge of all this security. I met Hamdullah Mohib years ago when he was an aid to a presidential candidate. Now only 37 years old, he is the National Security Advisor to the President. Attacks here have caused massive casualties, people feel fearful. It has a psychological impact when you live like this. Every day, my heart is pumping worried about my children until they come back from school. Like many young Afghans in positions of power today, Mohib fled his homeland as a child. He lived in a refugee camp in Pakistan but was one of the lucky ones who got an education in the west. Then he returned home to try to rebuild his country. The Afghan people have been desiring stability ever since I was born. My generation grew up in this war and all we want to see is to be able to do the normal things that everyone else takes for granted. Mohib gets daily briefings from his generals who tell him that they are winning the war. This is a different kind of warfare. We have the conventional warfare that most militaries are prepared to fight. Yeah. And they're trying to do that. And then there's this gorilla type of warfare mixed with terrorism and tactics used by the Taliban. These tactics are bringing the war right into Mohib's backyard. 20 years of fighting has settled nothing. When I first started coming to Afghanistan the Taliban were just ghosts. You would never see them. I mean, even on the battlefield just the occasional muzzle flash or a bit of movement in the foliage. They were very good at removing their dead from the battlefield so you didn't see the corpses. They were a myth more than anything else. The Taliban started as conservative religious students based in the southern province of Kandahar. Many had taken up arms against the Soviet troops that occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s. But once the Soviets were driven out, a vicious civil war erupted among rival political factions in the 1990s. The Taliban emerged as the dominant force in this chaos. Sweeping the country and capturing Kabul in 1996. Once in power, they closed girls' schools, banned music and television. They forced women to wear the burqa and executed people for minor transgressions. But they offered an alternative to the rampant unrest of earlier years. That made the Taliban popular in some places especially in the southern villages. But a lot of educated people fled the country. Then, in October 2001, the Americans invaded. - The Taliban had been harbouring - Al-Qaeda leaders Who plotted the 9/11 attacks in New York City. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against the Al-Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The name of today's military operation is Enduring Freedom. I don't know now if there is such a thing as a good war. But definitely, at the time, there was a feeling that the war in Afghanistan was noble somehow. Not just the foreign troops but everybody who came with the foreign troops. The aid workers, the journalists. - Almost all of them felt - as though they were pushing back The forces of darkness in Afghanistan. They were pushing back the forces of evil and barbarism. I was swept up in this fantasy that gripped everyone in Afghanistan. All the foreigners, and frankly the entire western world at that time. It was a kind of romantic notion, a flawed romantic notion. That belief inspired Canada and dozens of countries to more than 100,000 foreign troops. One of the soldiers I came to know was Ayesha Wolasmal. Born in Norway, she often visited family in Afghanistan. She joined the Norweigan Army in 2006. We arranged to meet one morning in the garden of a heavily protected compound in Kabul. What was that like putting on the uniform? Fantastic. It was very emotional. Even though I was very young, I immediately had this feeling that I can, you know, be a bridge maker somehow because I grew up in a very conservative traditional Pashtun family. And I picked up on a lot of cultural nuances, that whole kind of tribal thinking. I have to admit, I wasn't that intellectually invested - in the whole peace and democracy - aspect of it. It was more the immediate, you know, relief for the population, as I saw it. You're sort of saving the people from the Taliban. Yeah, exactly. So that was a very strong sentiment. At first it all seemed easy. In a little more than two months, the western armies drove the Taliban from power. And I remember music playing, Afghans love music. As soon as the regime was toppled, I felt that, "Okay, now the world has access to Afghanistan. And Afghanistan has access to the world, to all the impulses that help a country move in the right direction." Practically, that meant development projects coming in. Girls going to school, something as basic as that. Much has changed especially for the lucky few that live in cities. Foreign troops and foreign aid brought new freedoms and new opportunities. But when you leave Kabul, things get more complicated. Especially here in the south in Kandahar where I spent most of my time as a reporter. For me it was really important to cover all sides of the conflict. So spending time with Afghan Security Forces, trying to hear what the Taliban had to say. They'd go... well they stayed outside the wire beyond the razor-wire fence that surrounds the military camps and just listen to ordinary people. Kandahar is where the Taliban first emerged and it remains very conservative. Women in public pretty much always wear the traditional burqa. And yet, here is where, with Canadian Aid money, a friend of mine tried something bold. In a quiet corner of the city, these girls escape behind the high walls of this private school. They take off their burqas to attend classes in English and learn computer skills. Life is good. Life is good and we see you again. You're welcome. - It's so nice to see you. Ehsanullah Ehsan for years. Thank you so much. You look even younger than before. - Oh yeah! - How is it possible? We wanted to give you a little surprise. So good, it's so good. It is a surprise. But you're still here. I'm still here, I'm still surviving. It's definitely hard. It's very risky here to help all these women get education and especially modern education. To go out and work, to be self-sustained, to be independent, this is something unacceptable for extremists. For example, you are developing a magazine, right? Writing a magazine. So in the magazine, you need to put some photos or you are doing a report. But foreign money has dried up for his school as Canada and other western donors lost interest in Afghanistan. His school has gone from more than 2000 female students a year, to 200. And he struggles to give the young girls hope. There is violence against women in some countries and Afghanistan is one of them. These girls are here to get a broad education. In today's English class, Soraya and her classmates have an assignment on violence against women, a radical topic here in the traditional south. Now it's the turn of 12-year-old Shabnam. Islam has given women the right to work, study, and get education. I request every family to let women study, work, and get education. To shine one day and achieve their dreams. Let them fly like a bird and be honoured one day. Thanks a lot. It's not safe outside for women or anyone else, really. - Canadian troops fought and died - to protect this city And yet now it's under siege once again by the Taliban. Police are constantly on the lookout for insurgents and suicide bombers. They guard the city but they can barely protect themselves. Three police officers are assassinated here in Kandahar every week. And across the country, in some weeks, hundreds of security personnel are killed. So just now, 20 minutes ago, another target killing. Yet again, some gunmen on a motorcycle shot and killed an off-duty police officer. It's amazing the pace of these things. Even if the police are targets, we have no choice. We still need to rely on them for our safety. With two truckloads of armed men, we drive less than 30 minutes to the frontlines in the Panjwai Valley. This is where I first started to understand that there would be no military solution to this war. Canada took command of NATO operations here in the south back in 2006. It was the country's biggest deployment since World War II and, eventually, one of its bloodiest. I think I slept in that shelter over there. This used to be a Canadian base. It's called Masum Ghar. And now, there's hardly anything left. It's like a ghost town. This landscape haunts me. I almost died in this valley. I remember the bone-jarring intensity of the explosions. Just over there in the hazy distance, you can see Taliban territory. The Canadians, the British, the Germans, the Americans, they all fought to defeat the Taliban and they failed, essentially. Everybody okay?! I was just over there listening on the radio as Canadians on this hillside were trying to move north at Taliban positions. Year after year, battle after battle, I witnessed the same pattern. Foreign troops hammering away with modern fire power, the Taliban coming back again, and again, and again, with nothing more sophisticated than stubbornness. NATO's top commander - had great words of praise today - for Canadian forces... Canadian troops here have been very successful. The Taliban... - ...defeating - a significant Taliban presence. ...declaring the recent operation there a clear military victory. Canadian politicians and generals kept hailing the Afghan mission as a spectacular success. But looking back, it was really a string of failures. They just retreated and then launched a renewed insurgency that grew and engulfed the whole country. In my reports back then, I tried to sound a note of caution. But I often felt like a lonely voice in a crowd of media cheerleaders. I really questioned my own sanity sometimes in Afghanistan. I could see things were happening in front of me and I was trying to write them down and put them in the newspaper, and then military officers and government PR people would sort of tell me, "No, no that's not what you saw." It was a head-spinning experience. And I think that's what happens in a war where countries get swept up in this fervour. And they don't care what's true. They want to know, "How great are our boys? How true is our cause?" And I think that's the madness of war. For Canada, the madness would go on for five more years. We started to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2011 with 158 soldiers dead and at least 2000 injured. I began to question whether those sacrifices were worth it. I also began to realize that while fighting what we saw as evil that we ourselves had sometimes crossed the line into darkness. I had to go back to where I first saw that darkness. Maybe more than any other single place, where I really started to lose faith in the war in Afghanistan was inside the crumbling jail cells of Sarpoza prison on the west side of Kandahar City. Some of the stories I heard inside these walls... I can't forget. They're still with me. The prison has always housed common criminals but also plenty of political prisoners. You can hear the murmuring of men here inside the political section of the prison, that's where they keep the Taliban. We're not allowed to film inside there right now but the last time I was here, I spent a number of visits inside the political section here, and they told me terrible stories about torture and abuse at the hands of the security forces. And it really started to change the way that I thought about the war. This was kind of a turning point for me in my whole thinking about the conflict. When I first came here in 2007, I interviewed 30 detainees, the majority of them suspected Taliban. Many of them captured by Canadian soldiers - and transferred - over to the Afghan authorities. I spoke to men who showed me the scars on their bodies. They told me they were beaten, choked, frozen, whipped. There was one guy who'd been beaten so badly that he'd forgotten who he was. There was one young man who had a very vivid memory of being electrocuted and he showed me how he was flopping around on the ground like a fish. Terrible things happened to these prisoners when they were being interrogated. This shook me because it wasn't an accident of war. It was deliberate. It was a part of the design of the war. On a daily basis, prisoners transferred from Canadian custody into cruel hands. ...have no evidence of the specific allegations in the global... Why was this information not brought up in this house before? My stories caused uproar, debate, and investigations. The Afghan and Canadian governments tried to deny that torture was happening. ...evidence there is any access blocked to the prisons. Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas eu les mêmes exigences? To confirm the truth. Ansari Baluch, an investigator for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. He wasn't afraid to call out abuses by both the government and the Taliban, angering the Taliban all the more because he worked with people like me, western journalists. Working with foreigners can taint you. Everyone in your community thinks that you are a spy for the Americans. So I was worried about the fallout and how that was going to affect Ansari. Several months after my stories appeared, Ansari disappeared. I found out later - that the Taliban - had kidnapped and beheaded him. I always felt bad about dragging Ansari into the spotlight because he was trying to do his human rights work quietly, behind the scenes, and I was trying to make a headline. In Afghanistan. But I think how you feel about that depends on whether you feel responsible. And that's why today's meeting is going to be tough. I've tracked down Ansari's family. Mokhtar is his nephew. Anargul is his daughter. They say that the human rights advocate - wouldn't listen to the family's - concerns about his safety. When the Taliban snatched Ansari and asked for a ransom, to meet the kidnappers. You started digging in the earth. Yeah. Ah, the clothes. Yes. I'm sorry, my friend. That must have been incredibly hard. And his hands. I'm sorry, my friend. And Shahid in red is a martyr. Yeah. - I think what happened - to my friend Ansari Baluch Is symbolic of the ways that we as foreign journalists put our friends into danger. It's something that we really have to grapple with about whether or not the things that we ask people to do are worth it. Ansari was just one of the many people I've known killed in this endless war. A journalist who worked with Canadian reporters, a tribal leader who helped me to understand local politics, A Canadian soldier who protected me in battle. Like so many others who died, they wanted a better Afghanistan. One of the things is how much of that striving was wasted. In part because of the abuses and the corruption of our supposed allies. A lot of the western aid money for schools and hospitals In recent years, poverty's gotten worse. More than half the population now lives These days, what separates squalor from splendour are guards and gates. Inside wealthy enclaves, the elites enjoy their parks and fountains. None of this existed when I first came here to Kandahar. Certainly not this fountain. I mean, this is a dry country. It's one of the poorest countries in the world. And so to see this, it's pretty stunning. And it really gives you a sense that some people are doing pretty well for themselves in this war. And it's actually, you know, this is part of the reason why the war goes on because it's good business. Not all of the wealthier is from corruption, but this is not the kind of neighbourhood where it's safe to ask people how they made their fortunes. The drug trade, stolen aid money, all kinds of schemes have made Afghanistan one of the world's most corrupt countries. A problem so big, so obvious that government leaders don't really try to deny it, as National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib told me. To get quick fixes, we empowered some of the very warlords that people were fed up with. We put them in positions of ministries and governors. As businesses, they were given lucrative contracts. Police chiefs. Vice presidents. Governors. Men who have been accused by international human rights organizations of gross violations. Many of them warlords of the past still have a grip on Afghanistan. I think there has been a lot of injustices in the last 18 years conducted by our government or people, and I think whether willingly or unwillingly, however it has happened, but I think it has led to people joining the Taliban. There has been a lot of corruption in the government and I think we should not free ourselves from that. Own it and fix it. Widespread corruption has not been the only thing driving people to the Taliban. There have also been mounting civilian casualties in the US-led war. This is where they count the numbers and track the abuses, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. It says a lot about the situation that any sort of official building looks like a fortress with intense security checks. It's so tight that they took my chocolate away from me. They think I'm going to kill someone with a chocolate bar. They took the pills too. Oh yeah, the cough drops. My good friend Shaharzad Akbar heads the commission. Akbar's family spent the Taliban years in a refugee camp. Her parents firmly believed in education for women and she went on to become the first Afghan woman to study at Oxford University. The future of human rights... At 33 years old, she's probably the leading human rights advocate in Afghanistan. ...for our international partners. What bothers Akbar is the sheer level of carnage inflicted by both sides. You can really see that footprint of war on the most vulnerable, the children. Over the years, I've seen far too many of the war's youngest victims. This generation has grown up in a world shaped by violence. Recent years have been because of increased fighting on all sides. One of my friends is trying to do something here at an orphanage just outside of Kabul, home to 150 children from toddlers to teens. Mariam Wardak takes in as many orphans as she can. We have people coming to our door every day saying that we have another orphan. We can't accept it because we have exceeded our capacity. Everybody has become numb to the children of war. How can you become numb to something like that? Wardak comes from a prominent family. Her father was a famous rebel against the Soviet invaders, she recently worked as a senior security official for the Afghan government. And now, she's dealing with the human consequences of rising insecurity. The children at Wardak's orphanage have suffered at the hands of all sides of the war. The Taliban as well as the Americans and the Afghan government. In the fighting. Hamidah saw her mother gunned down by the Taliban. His family was killed in crossfire. Do you know who fired against your family? War is blind. They don't know who to be angry with, they don't know who to look forward to, they just understand that there is violence and that they're afraid that they can get in the crossfire between the Taliban or the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces that could cost them their life like it has cost their parents' lives. They know that they need to fear both. But they don't understand who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. - It can be hard - at times to tell the difference Between the supposed good guys and the bad guys. That's what Ayesha Wolasmal discovered once she took off her soldier's uniform. When I was in a uniform, my entire understanding of the situation was a very kind of security-based understanding. But it was only when I actually came back to Afghanistan as a civilian, you know, as Ayesha, Masuma's daughter, that I got a reality check and I think the strongest symbol of that was when we took a taxi like a Corolla between Kabul and Kandahar. And I'd say it's like 45 degrees and it's really, really hot and we're both in our burqas. - And there was an American convoy - passing. And I'm sitting there for the first time not in a convoy but just like a normal civilian. And I sat there and I felt... Suddenly I felt that I witnessed the occupation in action. Even though I had been part of these convoys myself but we ended up waiting three and a half hours for this convoy to do whatever they were supposed to do. And me and my mom were fine but there were tons and tons, long lines of cars with women, small children. For them it was a full-blown occupation, for them it was seeing people that don't look like them control their cities, control their check post, control their movement. In the villages, people told her about being terrified of foreign troops or Afghan government forces as they hunted for the Taliban. I remember so many stories about my relatives telling me about how their sons were just like taken out in the middle of the nights, you know? In front of their mothers. Black paper bags were placed on their heads and they disappeared. Even two weeks ago, I met with people not faring night raids by the Americans but the Americans have trained the Afghans that well that now the Afghans are doing it. Sadly that's everyday life. The bloodshed, uh... I mean, the sons, the husbands, the fathers, but also the young children. I mean, it's absolutely devastating. The numbers are staggering. Since the war began in 2001, hundreds of thousands have been killed. No one knows the exact count. A cemetery for bodies that are unclaimed, unidentified, unknown. It was a sad enough place when I visited a dozen years ago and today it is unbelievably bigger. More people are killed in this war every year than in any other conflict in the world. Sometimes memories drift back to you in unexpected ways. I remember one night I was attending a play and I started crying, and I wept, and I wept. I hadn't cried like that in years. I really, really want this war to end. NATO is the most powerful alliance in human history by some measures. But military efforts to bring peace and stability have failed. The Taliban have only grown stronger. In propaganda videos posted on their website, the Taliban claim they are well armed, well trained, they can strike anywhere and they do. To find out how the Taliban are pulling it off, I went to see my good friend Rahmatullah Amiri, one of the country's most respected political analysts. Taliban are not just only getting stronger, they're getting organized, they're becoming some sort of a conventional kind of army. If you compare the Taliban of today versus the Taliban of 2014, you see a much different group. Amiri barely survived a Taliban attack on the American University in Kabul in 2016. 13 people were killed and more than 40 injured including Amiri. Four bullets hit me, two in the abdomen and one in the leg, one in the arm. I was pushing myself against the ground to get to the police because the police was probably 10 metres away from me. They could hear my voice but they could not come because the attackers were pretty close by. Then I thought, "Okay, let's try a bit more." Because my mom lost four sons. I knew that if she lost me, I don't think she would survive because I am the solo breadwinner of the family. And... And she's very close to me. So I didn't give up. Amiri slowly recovered, rebuilt his strength, and he believes the Taliban were doing the same. By 2019, from safe havens in Pakistan, expanding their control across Afghanistan. From experience travelling across the country, I would say in terms of terrain, Taliban control between 50 to 60 percent of the country under their full control. That's what I would say their full control is. If you add the contested area, I would say 60 to 70 percent. That is not what National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib told me. He seems confident of victory. We have broken the back of the Taliban. They will lose their capacity to take and hold territory. We have a military part to victory in this conflict. That's not true. If the back of the Taliban could be broken, that would be from 2009 to 2014. Where hundreds of thousands international trips were there - and billions of dollars - were poured into reconstructions And nation building and everything. That was the only times where the Taliban were on the back foot. When the government talks about that, you know, breaking their back, I'm telling them they haven't reached their peak yet. Wow. The government needs to accept Taliban as a very strong, powerful force. They cannot treat them as a bunch of, you know, insurgents who are outside there. No, they have a very strong system, both a civilian and military system that is right now running almost half of the country. It's hard to get a sense of the Taliban's real power because it's dangerous for an outsider like me to travel into the vast territory they control. One night in Kandahar, we arranged to meet Abdullah, a former Taliban commander who grew weary of fighting but who still stays in touch with his former comrades. For his own safety, we are concealing his identity. We hire him to take a cellphone camera into a Taliban region not far from Kandahar City. You have to keep everything on this little chip here. It'll be good. Local fighters allowed him to film these images. They want to show the outside world how secure they feel in their strongholds. These days, the Taliban allow girls to join the boys in study at the local religious school. - But many families - pull their girls out of classes When they reach puberty. And these students are just memorizing verses from the Quran, not really getting a broad education. Farmers don't seem to mind being filmed as they finish harvesting the hashish crop. Drug cultivation is the biggest source of cash income for these people. Other farmers plant poppy seeds for the next season's opium. Both sides of the war earn tens of millions of dollars a year from illegal drugs. The profits allow them to buy more weapons, seize more territory. The drugs fuel the war. Wants to hide his face but he has a message to broadcast on television. This is not an empty boast. Intelligence estimates say that by early 2021, the Taliban already dominated much of the countryside. With only major cities under government control and under constant threat. The Taliban have shown their strength with spectacular attacks like this car bomb in 2018 in the southwestern province of Helmand. But this attack was different. Instead of suffering quietly, ordinary citizens decided to speak up. In all my years in Afghanistan, people usually debated how to win the war and now they started to argue about how to make peace. I came to this neighbourhood in Kandahar to find one of the organizers of a new grassroots peace movement. A young father of five children Bismillah Watandost makes his living as a freelance journalist and full-time activist. The Helmand blast inspired Bismillah and others to launch a people's peace march. They started with just a handful of people but grew to a few hundred, trekking more than 700 kilometres across deserts, through villages, for almost two months. Bismillah even took the risk of arranging to meet with local Taliban leaders face to face. As the peace marchers were making their way to Kabul in June 2018, the government and the Taliban declared an unexpected ceasefire. For three days, Afghans got a glimpse of what peace could look like. Mujib Mashal covered this story for the New York Times. Born in Kabul, he is one of the best journalists in Afghanistan. The miraculous thing about those three days was it was completely peaceful. To me, that was a sign that everybody's really tired. I remember we reported an episode from Kunduz where some of these Taliban fighters would come in, so we kind of chronicled their day, you know, where they had kebabs, where they had their ice cream, at the kebab shop they listened to music, and as they were riding back on their motorcycles... it was dusk time and the ceasefire was ending and they were crossing a bridge, and they were actually hugging goodbye with the people including the soldiers on this side of the line. They were hugging the same guys they were going to be shooting the next day. They shot at three days before they were going to go back to shooting them, and probably a bunch of those guys are dead by now. There was something about that moment, I think we have lost even the power to imagine that there could be a moment where everybody feels like they can breathe and they don't have to shoot. And as short as that period was and as insignificant in the larger loss of the war, it kicked a sense of possibility into people, you know? - It kicked a sense of possibility - into people, you know? And no matter how it came about, it was for the first time in a long time, not just in this conflict, in the spectrum of 40-year conflict at least for my generation, to think that the two sides can say, "Okay, we'll stop" and that it actually stops. - But even as - that dream of peace took shape, Afghans started asking questions. And at what cost? Resistance to any compromise with the Taliban has always been especially strong within the urban middle class. Many women are fearful of losing their hard-fought freedoms. And I was curious about the young generation of people who grew up surrounded by foreign troops and foreign aid. So I came here, to Kabul University. Mariam and her friend Adiba study photography in a country where the Taliban had once banned cameras and they have no intention of letting anyone turn back the clock. Despite these struggles, this generation dreams big. And also small with personal goals that are breathtakingly modest. What clothes would you want to wear? I, myself? Like men's clothes. Mini skirts? Men's clothes, suits. Men's clothes. Oh, okay, okay. Something like this. You want to wear colourful clothes? Why can't you wear colourful clothes now? I want to go for many of these young women. She's the most famous feminist in the country. Your phone just pinged? Something just happened? Another explosion? Yeah, in PD 12, there was a blast. And we still don't know if it has harmed anyone or not. This kind of security it used to be only embassies that did this. We're in what's known as an airlock, heavy steel doors that are closed on both sides of the driveway and they're never open at the same time. And so, you're in a little metal box, basically, just in case the car explodes while it's being checked. Farahnaz Forotan is only 28 but she is one of Afghanistan's best-known television journalists. I noticed you have Frida Kahlo everywhere. Here... Forotan revels in provocation. She decorates her office with the work of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, selecting images that would shock most people in this conservative society. That's like you. She used her fame to launch a social media campaign called My Red Line. Asking people to talk about the lines that they are not willing to cross for the sake of peace. She has travelled across the country collecting videos with messages of defiance. My Red Line has generated dozens of videos with tens of thousands of followers on social media. But it is mostly an urban phenomenon in a country that is mainly rural. Obviously there's a lot more at stake for women here, you know? They've come a really long way and they're right to be really scared of what a Taliban government would look like. I would struggle to sleep at night if I was one of them. Raised in the western world, Ayesha Wolasmal understands the fears of urban women. She's no longer a soldier. She now works with rural women in the villages and that gives her a different perspective. That fear is very different from the fear that women in the rural areas have. Because they haven't had the same level of progress there, they haven't gone from their mud house - to become parliamentarians. - Yeah. They're still in that same mud house. Illiteracy rates are extremely high, there are still girls being married off at age 14. So life hasn't changed. And I always noticed this throughout my travels. The more remote places you visit, the more it becomes evident that the discussion at central level is very removed from the realities of rural Afghanistan. I wanted to meet women like that but local traditions make it very hard for a foreigner, let alone a man. So I asked Wolasmal to introduce me to her friend Dr. Aziza Watanwall Azizi and I went to see her in Kandahar. Azizi was part of an older generation of women who came of age in the 1970s before Afghanistan plunged into war. She studied and practised medicine in Europe and then she came back at a clinic in Kandahar. Walk through her doors. Dr. Azizi invited a group of women she knows to a tea party at her home, - a rare occasion for these women - to talk to a foreign man And an even rarer opportunity for me to hear their point of view. In Kabul, we interviewed some women who don't wear burqa and they don't wear hijab even. They say this war is about freedom against peace. If peace comes and the Taliban come back to Kabul, they will lose their freedom. And I want to know if the women here feel the same way. I think in foreign countries, people think if Taliban come back to take a share of power that it will be bad for women, that women are afraid of the Taliban coming back. But these women are not afraid, I think. Can we ask why? Even here under anonymous burqas behind high walls, everyone has their own ideas about the key to peace. Over the mountains, more than 1000 kilometres away, those divergent ideas about peace in Afghanistan were being debated in a city that feels like a different world. Doha, the capital of Qatar. I've been shot at by the Taliban, nearly kidnapped a couple of times, so it feels strange to come here and arrange interviews with them. You can find something remarkable. A kind of unofficial embassy and headquarters for the Taliban with the support of the Qatari government. They've been here since 2013, a sign of how far they've come diplomatically. The Taliban meet openly with visiting delegations, plan their political strategy, I was curious to meet the younger Taliban thinkers. Amar Zmarak is 35 years old. Like a lot of new leaders who work in the Taliban's political office, he's well-educated and worldly. He works diligently to spread the movement's message. The Taliban once banned television but now they have a sophisticated web presence, active on social media in Pashto, Dari, English, and Arabic. We are the age of technology. In our elder time even all over the world, there was not as much technology as we have now. So due to technology, there is more knowledge, there is more education, there is more progress in any field. So we are more progressive than the past generation. When the world gives an opportunity to us to prove ourselves to the world, what we are and what we want, they will be surprised and they will find us very different. Zmarak dreams of returning to a homeland that he has never seen. I was born in exile. My children are now living in exile. So exile is now kind of life for us. Every day and every night even in sleep we have dreams. Every night we live in Afghanistan in our dream. He and his fellow Taliban comrades in Doha now sense that they have a chance of getting back home. The United States waged war against the Taliban for almost two decades. Some not even born when the war started in 2001. And now the Americans also wanted to go home. A desperate America needed to change strategy. After decades of refusing the US began to do just that. In 2018, the Americans came to Doha to start official negotiations with the Taliban... without the Afghan government. Mujib Mashal of the New York Times says the stunning reversal came about because the Americans felt trapped. The noose had tightened too much. - The military noose. - The military noose. - The Taliban's gain of territory, - the Taliban's confidence. - The Taliban's gain of territory, - the Taliban's confidence. There's an acknowledgment of the fact internationally that they are a power to reckon with. So the Americans were forced to reckon with Taliban's stalwarts like this leader, Khairullah Khairkhwa, who was the Taliban's interior minister and a provincial governor. Captured shortly after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, - Khairkhwa spent 12 years - in the American military prison At Guantanamo. His detention file describes him as a trusted and respected Taliban official, a high risk to US interests. But he was set free by the Americans in a prisoner exchange. Khairkhwa went from wearing a prison jumpsuit to more dignified clothing at five-star hotels. Khairkhwa became a key player in the Taliban's talks with the Americans, surrounded by lush gardens and palm trees. The Taliban negotiators, and tortured, found themselves face to face with US military commanders. It's a really, really odd, bizarre image around the table. You have people in uniform at the table, people who have been involved in special operations, people who are very well-known for the kill/capture missions and things like that. On the other side you have pretty much half of the Taliban delegation, some of the most key negotiators who've spent a decade in orange jumpsuits in Guantanamo. Now the two of them sitting across as equals. But by negotiating directly with the Taliban, the Americans outraged many of their allies in the Afghan government. National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, who spent his life fighting the Taliban, felt betrayed. I think what the Taliban would achieve out of this was legitimacy. And that's goal number one. Establish yourself as the legitimate saviour of Afghanistan who has defeated a superpower and freed the country from their invasion. Once you've legitimized yourself and delegitimized everybody else then you want to negotiate. That is not a negotiation, that is a surrender. The Afghan government, the Afghan people stand no chance, no fighting chance once that deal is struck. Because like I said, moral is gone. I mean... Perception is reality. The perception there would be is the Taliban defeated the United States and all its allies, NATO allies. Who in their right mind in Afghanistan would stand in their way? Activist Farahnaz Forotan is doing her best to stand in their way. Her My Red Line campaign has mustered a lot of opinion against compromise with the Taliban. This poses a dilemma for Shaharzad Akbar. As the head of Afghanistan's human rights commission, she has always advocated for women's rights. But she is also in favour of peace talks. Interesting. And what did you say? Akbar went to Doha along with other prominent Afghans to meet the Taliban. She pushed Khairkhwa and his comrades on where they stood on women's rights. - But his answers were too opaque - to reassure her. So when the Taliban say they're committed to protecting the rights of women - that have been given to them - by the sacred religion of Islam, What does that mean? Despite the tensions and mistrust, by February 2020, the Americans and the Taliban managed to pull off a deal. The Taliban paraded to the signing ceremony, triumphant. Maybe they didn't win the war, but the Americans had failed to defeat them. And the United States was finally admitting it. It doesn't show our victory, but definitely shows the loss and the weakness of the Americans and all other foreign troops and foreign countries who have troops in Afghanistan. Inside a Doha hotel ballroom packed with dignitaries from around the world, a historic handshake between the US Special Envoy for Afghanistan and a Taliban leader. Something hard to imagine in previous years. But this was not a peace deal. There was no ceasefire on the horizon, no vision for the future Afghan state. The Taliban promised to prevent Al-Qaeda or other groups from using Afghan soil for terrorism. The Americans promised to pull out of the country if the Taliban started talking with the Afghan government. The US hoped that somehow the two sides could reach a compromise across the battle lines. But that hope vanished once the Americans withdrew the last of their troops. A corrupt government and its demoralized forces collapsed in a matter of weeks. By August 2021, the victorious Taliban had swept back into power. Hamdullah Mohib remained to the President until the very end. I think the word peace gives warmth to everyone's heart. People immediately assume that we will have stability. Unfortunately, that's not always the case. If you strong-arm us into accepting whatever deal you strike, you're going to banish us from our own country. We would be seen as traitors. There would be no space, there would be no room for us. The Taliban are extremists so you may see a bloodbath on the streets of Kabul. So this was not a simple matter of negotiation in a difference of opinion over policy, this is about the future of my country, my people, quite literally, our lives. Those left behind will live under Taliban rule, something they could not ever have imagined. Already, threats to her life had forced Farahnaz Forotan to flee the country. Shaharzad Akbar chose to stay until the last minute, even as she saw her dreams for the future vanish. People want peace, that's one thing. How they want it is subject to different interpretations, different groups, different ethnicities, different areas. Most of the people in Afghanistan want international troops to withdraw from this country. Having said that, they also want the Taliban to compromise with the other Afghans. That's the two things. Nobody wants to go to the Taliban Rule of 1994 to 2001. And nobody wants the current corrupt government options either. So there must be some story in between. That dream of an "in-between", of a compromise at the peace table that would include all Afghans, crumbled with the Taliban victory. At the time, this journey inspired me, because I felt, however briefly, that there was a chance for some kind of negotiated end to the war. Now very little remains of the foreigners' plans for Afghanistan and the dreams we inspired, except for painted slogans on fortified walls. Soon, even those will disappear. Now girls are putting their burqas back on, and venturing out, like so many others, into an uncertain future, once again under Taliban rule.
