Oi! Stop! Stop! This way. You three go east. You. Hello. Oh my... Round the side. Move. Get out of the way, scum. How dare you? Same time next week, gents? You took my money. Oi you, come back here. Where is he? Get out of the way. Move it. Quick, round the side! Quick! Ah! Eugh! He stinks! Now, let's try the sword. Oi! Stop! Stop! Go get him! Shit! Whoa. Hey! Looking for something? Money well spent, thank you. Thank you. - What's your name? - Robin Hood. He's getting away. Quick, stop him! Ya, ya. Here we are, girl. Home sweet home. Good girl. Lillian? Hello, little sister. Is that what I think it is? Maybe. You brought that animal back here, you'll lead them straight to us. It'll be fine. We'll leave it out the back. I need a new horse anyway. Hurry up, we're running late. For what? To give away all our food? Why must we give away What little we have to those that we don't even know? It wasn't even ours in the first place. Yeah, but it's very hard to steal. Not everyone can do as they please, Robin! If nobody else helps them, who shall? Certainly, not our queen or the sheriff. Stop your whining. We'll be down at the camp soon. It's Just down the valley. But I'm hungry now. Don't worry, they'll be prepping something nice for dinner. Think about what we can get from this beast when we turn him into the slavers tomorrow. Will Big John be getting fed tonight? Don't you think you've had enough? Taking the Kings mead is why you're in here. Still thinking with your stomach. In the fighting pits, you won't get fed unless you win. I'll win. Don't you worry about that. Think you're going to be 'Little' John soon. There you go, buddy. There you go, that's it. Oh my god! That's all I have. It's cool, isn't it? What is it? It's called a trebuchet. It's a siege engine. There's hundreds of them around Sherwood Forest. They're all leftover from the Great War. Guards! Guards! Robin did you see that? That was barbaric. You have to do something. It's not our war, Lillian. You're just going to let him go to his death? No, I'm gonna follow him. There must be a prison outpost near here. Probably just down on the river flats. They'll have food, wine, maybe gold - everything we need. I'm gonna go investigate. Wait here. Let me come with you. No, no, it's far too dangerous. Stay here. By the time you count to 100, I'll be back, I promise. Just wait here. I'll be back. Count to a hundred! Here we are, boys. Look what we got. Nice big beast to sell to the slavers tomorrow. Fetch a good price, won't you beast? Let me out and you'll see. What have you got for us, boys? Oi! Let us out of here. What was that? There you are. I was looking to catch your attention. Were you? You've got a pretty face, you know? I could be of better service out of this cage than in it. Could you? And what sort of service are we talking? 97... 98... Ever seen up a lady's skirts, boy? Boy, look what I found. Something's wrong. Ah, look what we have here. Faster! Quick, I need to save my brother. Just over the hill. Slightly to the right. Whoa! Again. Move. Be free. Run. Well that's gonna raise the bounty on my head. Throughout the kingdom, the Sheriff of Nottingham's men inflicted brutal and uncompromising rule upon the people. Hunting was outlawed, livestock was confiscated and winter stores stolen. Take it all. That's it?! Your penchant for Chinese guards is rather expensive. I like them. They don't talk back. Sheriff... I summoned you here because we need more gold. I shall have to raise the taxes. No, no. No more taxes. People don't like taxes. It makes them unhappy and I can't stand unhappy people. So miserable. Moping around with long faces. No taxes? Excellent idea, your majesty. We shall fill the royal coffers by selling air. Oh, can we do that? Your highness, I don't know why you put up with this... impertinent sell sword. Because he's efficient. He gets things done. If he is so efficient, why are we always running out of money? Because you scroungers keep wasting all my money. Looks like Mr Efficiency needs to do his job and get us some gold. - His skills lie elsewhere. - Really? I would love to know where. - Kill him. - With pleasure. Uh-uh-uh. Sheriff, would you be so kind? Huh? But your majesty. Oh! Very efficient. Now, get me some more money. Cedric, my old friend, how are you? Hey! There he is. I heard they almost caught you. Well, almost counts for nothing. Anyone that can outrun a platoon of royal guards is alright in my book. I think you've earned yourself a drink. - I think I have, too. - Three pints of ale. No. Two. You're not drinking. When are you gonna stop treating me like a child? When you're not a child. You know what? Little baby cup for my little baby sister. Cheers. That's disgusting! I'm going home. See you two codgers later. She's gonna be trouble that one. She sure is. Runs in the family, though. How can I help you? Well, you can help us in many ways, sweetheart. Tell me, do you know the penalty for hunting in the royal forest? I do, but I'm no hunter. Well, we've tracked a well-known thief to this location. Where did he come from then? You wouldn't know anything about that would you? Where's Robin Hood? I have no idea who you're talking about. Don't feign innocence with us, missy. We know who you are. You and your thieving brother. Thieving? You're the only thief around here. Your taxes and hunting restrictions are bleeding the people dry and starving them to death. What you must understand, little girl, is that people like your brother are costly to deal with. Because of him, I've had to upgrade my guards. Do you know the cost to hire Asiatic mercenaries? Trust me when I say, when I catch him... he will hang! You are hereby arrested for poaching in the royal forest and holding stolen goods for which the penalty is death. Go round the back, make sure she doesn't escape. My brother will hear about this. I'm counting on it! Do what you want with her. Lillian? Lillian! Lillian. - Wonderful. - It is. Wonderful moment. Squire, help me with this arm our would you? It's jammed. Again? We'll have to get you a new one. It's fine. Thank you. And the weather is beautiful, the crowds are here. Wonderful celebration. It's a great idea of mine. - My lords... - Oh. My lords and ladies and good gentle folk all. We do so heartily welcome you to the tournament arena for the Queen's royal joust! Introducing our first competitor. Bearing the standard of crimson red, we call forth Sir Simon! Good luck to you. Now, my lords and ladies, now, now. For it is my time to introduce to you our most beloved, our favourite, our reigning champion, the one, the only, Sir Lancelot! Ah, wonderful. Yes! He's going to win this, hands down. Ya. Whoo! Ya. Oh! No. A beautiful pass my lords and ladies. A fine pass but, alas, no dismount. At last our knights shall take their place at the end of the list to commence a second pass. Ah! Fabulous. Yes, my lords and ladies, a fine shattering of the lance bringing Sir Lancelot equally tied with Sir Simon. Oh, I knew, he'd do it. Yes! Yes! Ah! Go on! Ah. Oh. Damn it. This one's for the queen! Ya! Lancelot has broken even against Sir Simon. What say you? - Fabulous. - Yes it is. - I knew he'd do it. - Very good. My lords and ladies. This shall be our final pass. Who's cheering on Sir Simon? Well, my lords and ladies, who's cheering on Lancelot? She was an innocent, Cedric. The things they did to her. My lad, she was an angel, indeed. We all share your pain. Yeah, then why is nobody doing anything about it? Well, what would you have us do, uh? Storm the castle with our pitchforks? Yeah, if that's what it takes. We're just poor villagers. This sheriff has an army of guards, knights, soldiers with weapons that we can't hope to match. So we're just meant to take it? We're just meant to get stabbed and killed and raped and the men should just tax us within an inch of our lives. It's not what I'm saying. No, this is bullshit. Heads up. Sheriff's guards are heading this way. Word is they're looking for you. Hide. We're looking for Robin of Loxley. You wanna rob a locksmith? Silence! Any man woman or child harbouring a fugitive will be severely punished. However... anyone with information leading him to us... will be swiftly and generously rewarded. Huh? No takers? Well, if you do see him, you know where to find us. To hell with it, I'll do it myself. Robin, don't. It's suicide. Oof. My lords, my ladies and good gentle common folk. After such a fine display of courage, hon our, chivalry and skill... it is my absolute hon our to present to you your champion, Sir Lancelot! Wonderful. Sir Simon. On your knees. On your knees! Finish him off. Lancelot! Finish him off! Your majesty, this is but a tournament. The rules of a tournament state that if... Sheriff. What is this? What is the meaning of this? Knight's code clearly states that he shall not be punished for anything that - you stop! No! No, no, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, stop! Stop! This is an outrage! I thought it was rather funny. Have you no hon our? You animal. Guards! Take him away. In the eyes of God, this is wrong! The people... No! No! No! No! Hello Robin. How's your noggin'? Yeah. I've felt better, but I'll live. I can fix you a tonic. Water would be great. Water? You know fish fornicate in it? If you need a refreshing beverage, there's mead in yonder barrel. Thank you. Meh. So, why did you stop me? Do I need a reason? Perhaps it was just a moment of human kindness. Eugh! One man reaching out to another. We all know who you are, Merlin. What you are. And what might that be? A lecherous old goat, a scamster, somebody that doesn't help anyone unless he's well paid. - Oh, that's a bit harsh. - That's a bit generous. Well, you're right and you're wrong. Shouldn't have expected a straight answer from you. Well, you're right if you think the sheriff is dangerous, capricious, malicious, very unpleasant and must be stopped. But you're wrong if you think you can do it by yourself. You heard the villagers, they don't want any part of this, Merlin. It's not to them you have to look, Robin. You have a gift young man, an incredible skill with a bow. It's almost magical. Look to others who carry skills, who have integrity, who have that fire in the belly that you have, then you'll be unstoppable. You heard the sheriff, he has an army. He has Lancelot by his side, red-crested mercenaries work for him. Even if I could find these so-called allies that you speak of, they're not going to help, it simply wouldn't be enough. You do your part Robin... I'll do mine. That is an impressive trick. Clothes. There is one condition, however... You must find a symbol. Something that people can rally behind. That strikes fear into the enemy. Fight with hon our. Fight with valour. You may fail. You may fall. But the quest for justice is eternal. The fire will spread and your people will complete your quest. The hot coals of rebellion will smoulder and ignite in fury. For those with fired fields and stolen stores, empty stomachs and heavy hearts. Rise... for the downtrodden, the weary, the weak... rise! For your sister, Robin, you must rise and become the hero you were destined to be. So... are you still considering your loyalties? My loyalties... are to God and the people. I've accepted my fate. I'm ready to die. Oh, we're not going to kill you. Your fate is much worse than death. Move, dog! Move! By order of the Queen of Nottingham... you are now banished. Thank you for the arm our. Get this shit outta here. Now! Blast these fish! I know you. Yes, I freed you. Damn well nearly blew my head off! You're welcome. "You're welcome" you say? I'm looking for a sell sword. Well, I don't own one. Means hired muscle. When we take the castle, if you help us, you can have everything in the royal food stores. All the food and wine that your heart desires. What say you? All the food wine I desire you say? I tell you what, one condition, as long as I'm never sober along this journey, I will join you. You got yourself a deal. Well, lead the way then, boy. This is the place. Tell the sheriff, I don't have his gold. Just come back another time. We don't want gold, we're told you're the man to get us weapons? Are you licenced? What licence? I'm only licenced to sell weaponry to the Queen's guard and those sent directly by the sheriff. Fuck the sheriff! Ah! Don't touch! There's not much of a selection in here is there? Ooh, it speaks! I speak and I'll wring your scrawny neck too if you don't help us out. What sort of weapon is this? Oriental. Far superior to your English steel. And what is wrong with an English bow? Absolutely nothing. It's good for hunters. And women - do not touch anything! How much for the bow? 25 pieces. 25 pieces? I hear you have some sort of problem with the sheriff for some sort of debt? Few gambling debts. Trivial amount of few hundred pieces of silver. Doesn't sound trivial to me. Look, payment from you gentlemen should keep him and the collectors off my back for a few days. You do have the gold to pay, correct? What if I offered you something greater than gold? I'm quite certain you cannot. What if I was to tell you that we aim to kill the Sheriff of Nottingham? Then I would check to see what herbs you have been smoking. If we do, your debts will be cancelled. Listen, the sheriff killed my sister. He's slowly starving the people of Nottingham. We need to do something. My comrades and I, we've vowed to kill him end this tyranny once and for all. These comrades, how many of you are there? Including you? Three. Chances of succeeding are about a million to one. Why on Earth would I join you? Why wouldn't you? In the name of the sheriff, open this door! Let us in! Three it is. Back door this way. Around the back! Four. - Shame we had to kill her. - Just following orders. Besides, it was fun. She was trying to get away... I have to give her credit, I mean, I've never seen someone take that many wounds to the stomach and still survive that long. I mean, where was her brother? He was in hiding. It would have been us at the other end of that sword if we didn't recover that horse. Better her than us, especially after what you did to her. - Oh she was nice. - You're an animal. Well... all's well, that ends well. Shame about that Loxley sprat, she'd have made a good wife in a couple of years. Bit young. Yeah. Yeah, especially with a nice piece of noble arse like that. Do you hear something? Nup. Thomas! I'm going to make you pay like she did. My sister deserved better. Robin of Loxley... No, no, no. No, Robin, please don't hurt me. Not me. It wasn't. It was him! No, no, no. Loxley, Loxley... It wasn't me. I did nothing to your sister. I promise. It was the sheriff that stabbed her. And you decided to violate her dying body. You're a dead man! The sheriff's gonna hear about this! Maybe so, but not from you. So where's Robin? I thought he was with you? He was definitely not with me. And where have you been? What have you done? Nothing that they didn't deserve. And who they? Found the guards who took my sister. You'll be a wanted man after tonight. No more than I already was. Why didn't you wait for us? Another drink lads? Think it'd be wise if you leave the whole barrel! If I hadn't of... taken the horse. It's not your fault, squire. No. Loxley! By order of the sheriff I order you to lay down your weapons. Sorry, I can't understand you? By order of the sheriff, I demand you lay down your weapons. I think you looking for other people, not us. Robin of Loxley, you're wanted for murder. What? How did... Who did you kill? Two of the sheriff's guards. That is disgraceful. Did you know about this? He told me he was a tap dancer. Enough! Lay down your weapons, or we kill you all. Gentlemen, let us settle this peacefully. Let us buy you a drink and be on our way. Step aside little boy. We want Loxley. Then I'm afraid you're gonna have to go through me. Agreed. Did you know he could do that? Played me. Whoa! Look out, mate! You stupid metal man! Look out, Todd, behind you. That guy can move! He can move like the wind this boy. Final warning. Ah, curse this weather! Ten-to-one I have a cold by the morning. Cold? When I was seven years old we were trained as warriors and sent into the wilderness with just the shirts on our backs. Oh please, the north's not that cold you big girl. Are you insulting me? Of course not. I like girls. Idiots! The fight's out there not here. Guys... the price on our heads will have gone up tenfold after tonight. Perhaps it'll encourage people to join the cause. Or it'll encourage every fool out there with a sword going for the bounties on our head. What did I say that for? You jinxed us. Knew you were bad luck. Who goes there? - We invited no one to dinner. - And the food's all gone. I'm not here for your food. I saw what you did to the guards tonight. I've come to join you. Yeah right. What are you gonna do? Wash our clothes? Besides, we already have a girl. We have no use for your skills here. Really? The three of you are going to take down the Sheriff of Nottingham all by yourselves. What concern of yours is that? His guards killed my entire family. Well, we all have sad stories. What can you contribute? Hmm. It's not that impressive. What else you got? Right. She's in. No, she's not in. You can't just bribe your way in. She is and she can. So, shut up and eat up. So sit down and tell us your name. My name is Freyda and if by my sword and cunning we can overthrow the sheriff, we can restore the land to its... Yeah, yeah. Enough of your fancy speeches. As long as you keep bringing food you're in. Contributing more than these two jesters. So what now? The sheriff will have every guard within 20 miles looking for us. Us? Yes, us. You're telling me that if I can knock that mead off your head, you'll take my watch for tonight? You won't be hitting it off my head, boy. I Don't Wanna Hurt You. Oh, you won't be hurting me can tell you that right now. Come on. Oh my God, you gotta be joking. - Did he even hit me? - I didn't see anything. - Didn't even feel a thing. - Give me another. - Another go? - Take another ten. Shh! Can I concentrate? I didn't even feel it. - I didn't see it. - One more. Let's see what you've got. Oh, you've gotta be joking. My God. Gotta be joking. What about you arrow boy? You want to have a go? I mean, if you want to volunteer your shift. I'll take that. Oh, we'll see about that. You sure you're up for it? - Are you ready are? - Born Ready. What about you lass? A woman knows when to pick her battles. Yeah, she might break a nail. You know what? If you can take this from my head, I'll do your shift for a week. Oh, now there's a challenge, eh? Unless you're scared? Ooh. Oh, she's getting up. I put my money on the girl. - Yeah, me too. - That's a bad bet. Aye, I think the boy is going to be going down, I think. - I'll be fine. - I don't think so. Yeah, you better warm up. Go on, lass. Don't want to pull you back. Oh. That's bullshit. - Oh... - Good one. ...now that's a woman I'd go to war with. Your majesty, I can't raise taxes again. I am already the most hated man in the land. And that's my problem because? I may have a creative solution for you. Show me. A royal proclamation that will solve all our money problems by redistributing the wealth to where it rightfully belongs. Ooh! Where do I sign? Here your majesty. The queen has just issued a royal proclamation naming me king and has tragically taken her own life. But I... We shall all mourn her loss. Is there a problem with this? No problems... your majesty. With the sheriff, now king, seated firmly on the throne, any resistance by the suffering people was quickly and ruthlessly crushed. Robin! You sly fox. You thought you'd sneak a look, did you? No, I was up here already. I was sleeping. I've heard you snore, you weren't sleeping. - Yes I was. - You weren't. You know, you could use a bath yourself. If you're offering? - You didn't see that, did you? - No, but I heard it. Well, I promise you it was as graceful as it sounded. It didn't sound graceful at all. Are you sure you know how to do this? You're not doing it right. I know how to bathe! Oh! I'll have you know I'm one of the cleanest men in all of Nottingham. I don't believe that for a second. Oh, yeah, I'll prove it to you. [Scoffing Whoa. There you go. I'm not ready for your tomfoolery. What the hell, Freyda? It's just a joke. Oh, hello uglies, this is quite a surprise. Bit of a turn up to be sure and quite unexpected. That we're back so soon? No, Robin, that you're back at all. One beautiful girl, a freak, a weirdo and a... pet bear. If you were starting a circus Robin, I would say you're making great progress. What does everyone think I'm his pet for? Did you hear of the attack on the sheriff's men? Yes, I heard a whole legion was wiped out by a band of warrior princes. Freyda, Tuck, Little John, my warrior princes. And all of you... - Sworn fealty to Robin. And we'll fight to the end to defeat the sheriff, or we'll die trying. Oh, I do hope you don't die. It would be... such a waste. Enough. You said that if I brought in allies, you would assist us in killing the sheriff. Here they are. Will you hon our that promise? Well? Hmm. It would be my pleasure. Oi! You're that Robin Hood! We could get 50 silver pieces if we turn him in. Quickly, call the guards! You can turn us in, collect a very hefty bounty and the sheriff will crush what's left of you. What crimes have we really committed? Defending people just like you? How many of our family members have to die before we stand up and do what's right? How many of your own families are starving to death because you can no longer hunt on your own land. The same lands that your ancestors died defending over hundreds of years. All is not lost. We can defeat them together. There is still hope. I say we rise as free men and women and we demand a change. I say we rise and we take back what's ours! Who is with us? And you'll all die. And nothing will change. - Who amongst you speaks? - It's Lancelot. The one and only. Honourable knight of knights. Undefeated. Once loved by all. Now... Nothing. Still loved by all. Still honourable in our eyes. Why don't you help them? Because it is futile. The gates to the castle are too heavily guarded. Even if you did sneak your way past the guards, you will find yourselves in a Labyrinth of corridors. The way I see it, unless you find yourselves a guide with another way into the castle... you're as good as dead. Enough! Enough! This is a waste of time. He's just a washed-up has-been. The sheriff will be strengthening the castles defences... to shore up his claim on the throne. You have to act immediately... reinforcements will be arriving from the Orient by the new moon. I ain't afraid of no Orientals. Puny little China men. Don't underestimate their power friend, they fight in ways you've never seen. And what of this way into the castle? I will tell you what I know, but you have to take me with you. You need me. There's a weak point on the south wing and I know what it is. All it needs is a little force. Maybe a lot. And why should we believe in drunks such as yourself? My word is all I have left. Hmm. Quite a fall. I mean... these here. This is quite a fall. Not yours. Did I bruise your ego? No. Just needed to get away from it all. From me? No. Everything. You cheated anyway. Ah... You know what they say? All's fair in love and war. No, you said you weren't ready. What are we fighting for anyway? Hmm. About tonight... I'm worried. - About? - You. Oh please, I'll be the one worrying about you. I can't afford to lose anyone else. Me either. Come on. We've got a castle to siege. Come on! There. The weak point. Patched with mudstone. Leads straight to the corridors adjacent the Queen's chambers. Lancelot, how was it that you came to know of this passage? Well, let's just say there was a time when I held the Queen's favour. I'm sure you held more than just her favour you sly dog. So we're going to blow this thing up. No, son... we're going to melt it. Will you be alongside us, Merlin? I'm afraid this is where I leave you. You see, Lancelot, I am a lover nor fighter. I'll see you all back at home when she's all finished. Good luck. Godspeed. Lift me up. You can't be serious? What do we do with that market girl, the one that helped Robin get away? Do with her as you wish. Ah shit. Robin! Robin? He's gone. It's well cold isn't it? It's well cold. Think I prefer being out in the grounds. Yeah, all the knights are gone. Funny that. I never saw Lancelot down there, did I? I never did. I never saw Lancelot. Yah! Come on. So, where do you s'pose he went? Fool! This way. Oh. Where are you sheriff? Gotcha. Drop it. Enough waiting. Lads. How thoughtful. You decided to surrender and save us a lot of time... and effort. She had her whole life ahead of her. Pity it was you who caused her death. Ah! My lord. What is your wish? A quick death? My blade plunging into your heart? Or a slow death, sliced and diced like a choice piece of meat? My wish is to cut out your filthy tongue. You can join me? Be my chief archer. Live in luxury in the castle instead of a forest. I'd rather die. As you wish. Goodbye, Robin. Robin! Come on. Robin. - Wait. - We're gonna get you. Intruders! Men! Robin! Throw him in the dungeon, we'll deal with him later. Robin, run! Come on. There's too many, we must retreat. Hold him, men. To the parapets! We have to leave, now. Intruders! Guards! Charge! Horses await by the treeline. Make haste! Move! Let's go! What are you doing? Come on! Lancelot! I will hold them back. Go! Go now! Up. Straight. - Enough! - Couple more. The sheriff wants him alive for his public hanging tomorrow. Throw him in number four. He'll enjoy the company. Are you alive friend? Yes, barely. Lancelot... How? Where are the others? I stayed to hold back the sheriff's guards while they escaped. That's very brave of you... and honourable. This is all my fault. I should not have brought you here. It was my fault. I shouldn't have run off like that. Selfish. In a few hours... our last sunrise will peak through these bars. Where there is life, there is still hope. Hope left this godforsaken kingdom long ago. Ah, friends, how did it go? Not as you'd hoped, I'm guessing. Hello ugly. Listen, I told you any arrangement, contractual business dealings we may have had are now off. Come now, as if you get to choose. I merely wanted to invite you to my coronation ball. I thought my own brother should be there. I have no brother. And since you betrayed everything we believed in, I want no part of you or your world. And so you actively assist the realm's enemies? Your enemies. Brother! Think of what we could achieve with you by my side as my advisor? I'll admit, my methods aren't always the most... Savoury. Let's not nit-pick. With the throne now in my hands, we could build our kingdom to rival that of Camelot. Centuries from now, people will say our names with... Revulsion, horror, regret. You always were a disappointment to the family. I am so going to miss these little family chats of ours. Oh shit. - We'll take care of this. - I'll find Robin. [Eerie crying Freyda! I'm sorry, I saw the Sheriff. Sh. Sh. Sh. Psst, Lancelot, wake up. Freyda's here. Freyda, on your right, look out! Take your hands off her! - Ah! - Freyda, run! Run for your life. Get out. Come on you little blondie. Goodnight princess. Bastard! Robin! Fight! Take your hands off her! Get off! Ah! Grab her. Grab her now. Taking you to the sheriff. He'll know what to do with you. Get off me! I'm going to kill you! Freyda! No! Bring her back! The people rose and the rebellion began. I'm coming with you. Move it, move it. Let me take care of this lot. - Good luck. - Where are you going? To get my arm our back. Run you slimy dog! Cowards. Time to send in the real men. I'll go. Hey? Hey? Did you spend that money, Robin give you? Thieving whore. Sergeant! Hello, shiny knight. You coward. I came here to protect the people. Innocent people like her, from vermin like you! Ah, princess. Now have two bitches! - Ooh! - Ah! That was... pretty good. Go! Run! She ain't going nowhere. Neither are you! Ah! Tuck! Go. You have to finish this. There's far too many. Looks like a fair fight to me. Godspeed brother. Drop it. Drop it! Drop it! You know, she screamed so much... and she knew that it was all your fault! Now, you'll be responsible for the deaths of two whores. Freyda! No! Die, bitch! Not quick enough! The arm our... ...looks better on me anyhow. - I heard it's hard to move in. - Hmm. Not from me you worm. No. No, no, no. I'm over here. Not her. No! Such a shame. She was so pretty too. That elbow always jams! Thieving bitch! Show us. Show us! Another friend once told me... where there is life... there is hope. Just shut up! Do you need a hand, boy? - John! - Uh? Ah! He was a great warrior. He was an honourable man. My people! People... My friends... for far too long the powers that be have robbed us of our families, our loved ones, and our wealth. That era is now over. A new dawn stands before us. So many people have died for us to have this freedom. We would do well to remember their sacrifice. But this day... this day is a day of joy. This day is a day of victory! This day we give the wealth of this land back to you! My friends, this peace has been hard won. Keeping it will be even harder. We trust you, Robin. The people trust you. I may have been the man to lead us in rebellion, but not in peacetime. This position must go to a man of hon our, a statesman, someone that we can all trust. Lancelot, you've proven yourself to be worthy. I hand this position to you. Robin? I don't know what to say. All those in favour say, "Aye". Aye! Aye. Then it is settled. You hon our me, dear friends. I will not let you down. Have we finished with all this talking then? It would seem so. Let's gets sloshed. To a new future. To a new future! And with the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride. How long do you think this'll last for? Where there is love, there is hope. Surprised to see me? Wizards like me do not die unless they plan it and this adventure has gone exactly to plan. The trick lies in not making people believe you are magic, but rather making them believe that you are not. Long live the king.
