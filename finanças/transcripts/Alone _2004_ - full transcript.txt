I wanna touch you. Okay. That's enough. What now? You're leaving now. Understood? Leave! Why should I leave already? We fuck, that's it. Got it? Hey, cutie... Alright, shut up, take your shit and leave! So see you Thursday. I'll pick you up. Alone Keep your hands off me! You look tired. How so? You tell me. Quite the rings under the eyes. Had a short night? None of your fucking business. - Oh, really? Your constant being late is suspicious. What do you mean? - What it means? It means next time you're out. I was at Tim's last night. - Really? I thought Tim was out. He is. But fucking is okay, right? You can talk. Take a look at yourself. Sorry. I did mean it, though. Something wrong? No, why? I don't know... Hi. Hi. Hello. I saw you. At the library. Good for you. Yes, me too. I thought maybe we could... Well... It doesn't matter... I need to be going, ciao. Bye. Bye. So who was that? - No idea, don't know him. Don't know him? I don't know, I just saw him briefly. Hi. Hello. Hurt yourself? No, it's alright. Anatomy of vertebrates. Are you becoming a doctor? - Veterinarian. Didn't know you could study that here. You can't. I only order the books here. I actually study in Munich. I'm doing my medical clerkship. Like an internship at the zoo. In Wuppertal. Listen. I thought... Yesterday in the canteen... I thought maybe I could ask you to coffee. I can't now, maybe some other time. - Wait. Here. Just call me if you like, okay? What's with you, honey? I don't feel like my place today. - So where? I want to go shopping. We'll go and you'll buy me some fancy clothes. If you say so. Do you really think you're the only guy interested in me? So what? Thanks. Everything alright? Yesterday I met the guy from the canteen again. We totally crashed into each other at the library. I think he likes me. And you? Do you like also him? Or is this just another quickie... You're really mean. It's not like he's the first one you've met. So what? You look posh today. Not bad, eh? When will you finally get away from that guy? So why do you live here and not in Wuppertal? Because here I can stay at my aunt's. At your aunt's... Must be very exciting. I thought you could show me around. Places to go out at night. I rarely go out. What, never? I like being at home. I understand. Of course I go out sometimes, but not often. There has to be something around here. Of course there's something. You know what? I'll show you something. Come! I'm currently working at the monkies' enclosure, with Nico. A fellow student, also from Munich. What is it you do there? For now we just keep an eye on the animals. Many are sick. It's rather boring. But we want to go to Holland soon. We've applied for a workshop. Like field studies, with a sizable chimpanzee population. Well and, now we're hoping for a positive answer. Will you be gone long? No, a little short of a week. This almost looks like a landing site for spaceships. I have often thought that. Sometimes I imagine them coming to take me away. And where to? What does it matter. I'm talking nonsense... Come! Listen. I'll just go to the toilet. Where can I put my jacket? - Who gives a shit. How about letting me arrive first. I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. Would you like something to drink? I have wine, Vodka, Tequila... No, thanks. I have to get up early tomorrow. Are you sure? Yes, unfortunately. I have a lot of work. So... see you tomorrow? Ciao. Bye. Was the boss here, for the gorillas? Yes, an hour ago. - And? Everything's fine. And what about Merlin? - Slept a lot, ate very little. Anything I need to look out for? - No, he got two tablets this afternoon. The vet said it's ok. Otherwise ...just call. What a surprise! How did you get in? - Oh, that wasn't too hard. I told the gateman I was your wife and you'd forgotten your sandwiches. Here. And he believed that. - No way, I told him we study together. My fellow student Nico. I've told you about him. Do you live at his aunt's, too? - No, we'll leave that to Jan... See you. Bye. Ciao. - Ciao. I'm really surprised so see you here. - So? Was it a good idea? Yes, absolutely. I actually would have liked to stay yesterday. I hope you didn't think the whole evening was shit. Nonsense. I did... Bad? No. So what are you doing here? We're watching Merlin. The little chimp over there. He's sick and the vet has prescribed medicine. Mind if I take a look around? - Sure. Just be quiet. Jan? I have to tell you something. Yes? I'm a little different from the others. And... - And what? I'm much, much prettier. How long do you have to stay? So tell me. It's the nice one. So then. The one from the canteen. Since when? Since last week. Are you glad? Yesterday I felt secure for the first time. Yes? No... No. I can't now. No, that's not a joke. I'll call you, okay? Who was that? The guy. What guy? Well, the guy. And what does Jan think about you constantly having affairs? He doesn't like it at all, that's why I'm stopping now. Then why don't you tell Wolfgang and all the others that it's over. I just did, didn't you hear? You don't see your therapist? I don't need the therapist anymore. I have Jan now, understood? I have Jan now and he's good to me! - You've only known him for a few days. You don't want this for me. Why are you doing this? I've never had anything like this, you know? You know, never, never, never! I do want this for you. I do want this for you. I know it's something very precious. I just want you to watch out for it. And the therapist could help you. I have Jan now. Have another drink? What? I'd love another drink. Another! - Yes! I almost can't anymore! Just one more! You left so swiftly last time, how come? - Piss off! Hey, can't we- - I said piss off! Who was that? Some asshole from way back. Keys. You want the key, eh? - Come on, or we won't get in. Are you kidding? - Why do you think that? I wanna know if you're kidding! I just want to go to bed. Do you want to fuck me? - No, that's not what it's about! Why don't you want to fuck me? Fallen in love with another, have you? - No, stop with this shit! You don't love me, do you? You just wanted to try me out. I'm tired. And I just want to go to bed. Wouldn't hurt you, either. Do you love me? I've thought of something. I want to leave with you for the weekend. Where to? That's a secret. Will you come? - Yes. Hello. What are you doing here? I don't have time. I don't understand. I said I'd call you. But you didn't. What do you want? Are you having somebody over? -No. Then let me in. Where are you going? I've met someone. One of those many others who are so fond of you? Listen up. About us, that was okay. It was nice. But nothing more. And I don't want it, anymore. You can just leave now, got it? I don't want 'us', anymore. - "I don't want 'us', anymore." So who is it you've met? Some guy from university? Who makes sweet, small student sex for you? You're really disgusting, you know? All of a sudden? It's over, you hear that? And who's going to buy you clothes? Here, take that shit and find someone else to fuck. I don't get the problem. - You are my problem! You think fucking you is the big deal! Like you can cope without me. Wait, don't go! Are you coming? - Yes, right away! What are you doing? I'll be right back! You think we'll still know each other when we're their age? Don't know. I'd like that. And you? I'd like that, aswell. Give me a kiss. What was wrong with you the day before yesterday? Why? Because you asked me if I was fucking with you. I was drunk. But you didn't seem to be alright. I was just wasted. Actually I don't have a problem. I didn't say you had a problem. I just wanted to say You know you can always call me when you don't feel good. It's important that you know that. I didn't mean to get on your nerves. You think I'm stupid, do you? No, no, I... I think you're great. Will you marry me? What? Will you marry me? I don't know. Maybe you're stupid after all. If you want to marry me you have to kiss me right now. Before the altar. I'll kiss you now. What is this? Nothing. I once crashed my bike into barb wire as a child. Do you think it's bad? No. Morning. Morning. Don't get up. Maria, I have to go. Don't get up. Stay. I have to go, or I'll be late for work. Will we see each other this evening? I don't know yet. I may have to meet Nico at the zoo later. I'll just call you later, okay? - No. Maria, I have to work. I can't spend all day in bed with you. Yes? Hey, it's Sarah. I'm just around the corner and I have bread rolls. Yes? Come on, let's have breakfast! No, I'm just cleaning house. Well, finish later. See you! I didn't sleep tonight. What did you do? I was out. You cut yourself, didn't you? I was away with Jan. We were at the sea together. Everything was just great. And then? Everything was so romantic, and I thought we would meet yesterday, but then he didn't have time for me yesterday. Does he know? No. He does love you, doesn't he? I don't even know what I want from him, anymore, myself! He probably leaves me when I tell him everything. Nonsense. Give him another chance. Do something nice for him. I must tell you something! Take off your jacket and come in first! Surprised? - Yes! What's the occasion? - Just so. Because I'm a nice girl. Now have a seat! This is great! Crazy. Are you hungry? - Yes. Bon app?it! - Thanks. Nico and I got our positive answer. What positive answer? To Holland. Our chimp field trip. We can go! When are you going? - Tomorrow night. Tomorrow already? Anything wrong? Hey, cutie. You're back. How was your holiday? What do you want. Are you in a bad mood? No. I'm doing great. Then I'll buy you a drink. Vodka? Yes. Two Vodka. For me and my lovely little... - Stop that! So? Found a new one to fuck yet? Can't be too difficult for you. But you are back now. No. You'll have to find another one. Because I'm married now. You are married... - Yes. So your husband just lets you come here alone. I can watch out for myself just fine. Of course. We'll toast to that. Cheers. Another? For old times' sake? Two more. You married quite quickly. You're gone for a few days, and... How is the guy? Why should you care? - Sure... But you know what I think? He's leaving soon anyway, when he finds out how you are. Nonsense. Maria... They all run away from you. Because no one understands you. You know that. Only me you can trust. As I know what you need. I'm always there for you. You're my little girl. Yes. Here's to you. And finally Madam shows up! Sorry. Another night gone swampy? What I do at night is not your business. Listen: If you can't master your sleeping around, it's your problem. I told you before that your work can't suffer from it. It suffers mainly form your presence. - What? Not my fault if you don't get a hard-on. I've had enough! I'm sick of your escapades! You don't need to come back next month. - What? Bye. Over. You're out. Sarah? Sarah, is that you? - Maria, is everything alright? Where are you? - At the convention, what's up? I fucked up again yesterday. I always destroy everything. Do you have time? Can we meet? I can't leave right now, but we can meet tonight. Shit. Where are you now? In a phone booth. Tell me, what happened? I don't want to destroy anything anymore. I want to succeed once in my life, I always destroy everything. Okay, listen: I have to work till eight, then we can meet. Okay? Please Sarah, tell me what to do. Please tell me... I don't know where to go. I have nobody I can go to. Maria listen, are you there? Yes, I... Maria? - I... I... I'm so alone. I'll be back tonight. You can go to my place, okay? But I don't want to bother you. - You don't. I'm bothering you, I know it. I'm too much for you. I always do everything wrong! - Now stop it! You're not bothering me and you can always come, okay? Did you hear that? Yes. Did you understand it? Yes. You know where my key is, go to my place and don't do any nonense, okay? Yes. Do you promise? Yes. Did you also cut yourself, again? I'll make us some coffee. One has to be pretty stupid... He's an asshole just like your father. Now, please keep my father out of it. This can't go on! Let's go to your therapist tomorrow. - No! But why not? There's no point, anymore. And Jan? Does he know yet? Tomorrow we're going to your therapist. And you're staying here tonight. What happened to your lip? I was on the hill, and tripped. But the spaceships didn't take you? Come. I'll help you with the bags. How was it? It was good. Really. It was nice. - Sure. What did you do? We could spend the whole time in the open enclosure. Watch the animals. They have a lot. 130? What about you? What happened here? - Nothing. As always. I'm leaving. Okay, see you soon. - Right. Have a nice weekend, see you. Everything alright? Did anything happen while I was gone? What could have happened? No idea. Are you alright? I called you yesterday, and didn't reach you all night. You don't trust me. - I do. I'm just asking. You weren't home all night. I was at Sarah's. And what did you do? A little party. I missed you. I missed you, too. I can't. You have an eyelash right here. Now you can wish for something. What's wrong? - Leave me alone. Has something happened to you? Maria, please. Please tell me... What's going on? I can't. Come on. That's psycho. You know that? We talked about this. When we were at the sea. Don't you remember? Of course. Now tell me what's going on! You know... I'm not good for you. I don't understand. I... I have my world. I have my own world. It's in here. And it's very deep. It's probably always been like that. I let someone fuck me while you were away. What? I didn't mean to, but I wasn't so well. I don't get you. What... Who do you think you are? - Don't shout at me! What are you doing? I'm leaving. You can't just leave now! Wasn't that important to you, with us? You know, I thought you loved me. I really thought you loved me. I do. So why are you leaving? You just don't get it! So explain it to me. I'm ill. I let guys fuck me who I've known for five minutes. I cut my wrists, here! That was no bike accident, that was all me! That's what's going on, you understand? Don't touch me! (unintelligible) When I met you, I wanted to do everything better. I really wished to be happy with you. Maria. - Don't. You were so good to me, so different from the others. But I didn't make it. I didn't manage to trust you. I trust nobody. - Please! Nobody, you understand? - Please, Maria! Let's talk about this. - What, what what! There's nothing to talk, there's nothing to try. I'm not good for you, don't you understand that? I always destroy everything. Is this what you do? Always run away? I don't want you to go. Leave me alone! Maria! Maria, now wait! Wait, stop! That was close. Where to? Straight ahead. Are you alright? - Yes. Are you married? No. Girlfriend? Just split up. Whose fault was it? - Hers, naturally. It's always the women's fault. - "It's always the women's fault." You probably cheated on her! - Listen, where do you want to go? Doesn't matter, straight ahead! - It does matter. Straight ahead! So? Cheated or not? "Honey, I'll never stick my cock into someone else."- That's enough, girl! Shit, what was that? Came from back here, you probably crashed into something. That's what I needed! Shit. Hey, stop! Stop! It's not as bad as it looks. Really. This is from the beach. But...
