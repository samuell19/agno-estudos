Mom? Mommy? Mom? Mommy? Mom? Mommy. Mommy. Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy! Neny, sweetheart, you have to learn to overcome your fear. But when you're not home, I'm comfortable in here. Anyway, you're home early? You said you'll be home tomorrow. I decided to come home early to see my spoilt baby. Well, that's new. I thought your work is more important than me. Why do you say that? Happy birthday, baby. Daddy... - Thank you, Dad. - Sure. I've got something for you. So, shall we? - But you go first. - Okay, I'll wait outside. Okay. Good morning, Mom. I've got something for my baby. Look. "Hi, I'm Bunny. Do you want to be my friend?" Since you have become friends, you should love each other. Take care of it. Thanks, Mom. Now let's blow the candles! Don't forget to make a wish. 1, 2, 3! Are you sure about going to a public school this year? - I am. - Why didn't you discuss it with me? Didn't you say I have to pick my own school? I know, but why Erly Dormitory School? I mean, do you even know what dormitory school means? That means you have to stay there. That makes it difficult for me to monitor you. Dad, Erly Dormitory is the nation's top 3rd school. And Mom went to that school too. But with your condition? You're different, honey. But you said to me... I have to overcome my fear. I've never wanted to be born like this. I never wanted to see my mom murdered by that black demon either. Neny, enough about that. Your mother died of heart attack. I don't want to hear that nonsense about the black demon anymore. Why do you never believe me? Just this once, please believe your own daughter. You're still under my responsibility. If anything happens to you, it will trouble me too. Your responsibility? Yet you're always busy working. I just feel lonely, Dad. If you think I'm just a burden... ...just let me stay there. And don't expect me to come home. Good evening. I'm Winda, the Resident Assistant of this dorm. Can I help you? Hello, I'm Neny Haliansen. I'm a new student here. Welcome to this Erly Dormitory. I'm Frans, her father. Then you may come to the office now. Please follow me. Okay. Where were you? Are you okay? Okay, then. I have to go home. Take good care of yourself. If you need anything, call me anytime. Your room is at the Melati Wing. Come on, I'll take you there. You have to be strong, Neny. You can't be scared. - Are you blind? - Sorry. Hey, wait up! Sir, come on. I'm just a couple of minutes late. Look at that, you let her in. I'm so sorry, Ma'am. Is this enough? I'm sorry, Ma'am. It was really an accident. By the way, where does the new students' meeting take place? I'll introduce myself. My name is Emilia Winata... ...the Principal of this school. You may call me Mrs. Emil. For 3 consecutive years, Erly Dormitory School... ...has been in the nation's top 3 schools ranking. And the best achievement is from Chemistry Class... ...which is led by Mr. Arnold. Thank you and good morning, students. And our school has been giving scholarships... ...to students who achieve. Excuse me, Ma'am, Sir. Sorry, I'm late. Bring the security guard here, now. Are you okay? This morning alone, we've already found three bad examples. You, for being tardy. You, for breaking the school rules. And what I dislike the most is... You, for being dishonest. I think the morning's introduction session is done. I hope you enjoy studying in Erly Dormitory High School. As of tomorrow, no need to come to work anymore. Hey, stop right there. I'm not done with you. Look what you've done! Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to break your phone. - I'll get you a new one. - Can you even afford it? Enough, Vi. She has apologized. - And she's gonna take responsibility. - What's your problem? Get lost. It's none of your business. Vio, you know about 'no phone at school' policy, right? - I know, but... - I should've got you suspended... ...for violating the rules this morning. - Thank you, Ma'am. - I'm not defending anybody. I'm just upholding the rules. But I just don't like arrogant kids who brag about their rich parents. I hope you can keep this between us. Mrs. Emil is awesome, isn't she? But I feel bad for Vio. Don't worry about her. I've known her since middle school, and she's always been stubborn. I'm Shila. Neny. Nice to meet you. So your mom went to this school too? You must be very lonely at home when your dad's at work. Yes, I am. My mother died when I was little. I'm sorry. May I ask what's the cause? Neny Haliansen? You're from room 113 in Melati Wing. And Shila Angelina from room 22 in Mawar Wing, right? - That's right. What's the matter? - There's a new student coming. She might be placed in one of your rooms. - I'll let you know when it's decided. - Okay, thanks. - I hope she'll be my roommate. - Why? Nothing. I'm just scared being alone in my room. - Aren't you scared? - Of course, not. I have Koko. - Koko? - Koko is my favorite doll. Sometimes when I get scared, I'd just talk to him. - You must think I'm weird. - Not at all. Then let's go to my room. Come on. All right. You go first. Hey, Dad. Can you send me the doll from my room? Yes, it is. Thanks, Dad. Hi, are you the new student? I'm Neny, your roommate. You love reading, don't you? Not many students here are bookworm like you. Most of them are actually bed bugs. Am I annoying you? Sorry. Neny! What's wrong? You look tired. - I'm fine. - Neny Haliansen? - I'll catch up with you at the cafeteria. - Bye. - You've got a package. - Thanks. You're welcome. Hi. What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? Sorry if I'm bothering you. Wait. Sorry, I was rude to you. - This is the way I am. - That's fine. Everybody has their own personality. - I'm Gie. - Neny. Why don't you take a break like everybody? I don't want to waste my time. What do you mean? I have come to this school on scholarship. Unlike most of you, with your parents' money. Meet my friend. His name is Bunny. Bunny? What are you doing, Neny? Meet my new roommate, Gie. Hey, Gie. I'm Shila and this is Koko. Great to meet you. - Hey, I'm going to the class, okay? - Okay. Your friend's weird. No, she's not. I think she's very kind. So you're still playing with a doll? Bunny has been my friend since forever. My mother once said, "Don't forget your friends." And Bunny is my first friend. I'm sure your mom's a kind woman. I think she's an angel. Oh, my God. Honey? Honey? Yes, hello? - Your client is here, Sir. - Okay, I'll be right there. So you lost your family since you were little? Yes. I should've died with them in that fire. - I think death is not a bad choice. - Don't say that. I think you're a good person. - So God still lets you live. - Thank you. But I'm not as good as you think I am. I have to get back to my class. - I'm glad we can share stories. - So am I. In this first day of chemistry class... ...we're going to learn about acid and alkali. Write it down in your notebook. Acidity... ...is a substance that will give sour taste to any object. Have you written it down? Neny, write it down. What are the examples? Lime, lemon, and tomato. Get it? Next, alkali. What is alkali? - It's a substance... - What's wrong? - Shila. Write it down. - Yes, Sir. Okay? What are the characteristics? It has sour taste? Neny, what's wrong with you? - Shila, take her to the clinic, go. - Yes, Sir. Let's go, walk slowly. Ms. Winda, can you help her? I don't know what's wrong with her. She's been acting weird like this in class. Neny, what happened to her? - No idea. - Neny... Okay, stay here. I'm gonna get her a glass of water. What's wrong, Neny? What did you see? The whispers... What whispers? The black demon is here. That black demon is here! - The whispers... - Calm down, Neny. Please drink this. You better rest for a while. You said something about black demon earlier. What do you mean? Nothing. It was just gibberish. - Hey! - Will you stop it? Can you spend one day without bullying her? Be quiet. I just want to ask her why she freaked out... ...when she looked at my face? Hey, answer me! Why did you scream when you looked at my face? Do you think I'm a ghost? Listen, if you're seeking the teacher's attention, leave me out of it. Are we clear? Bitch! You're a freak! Hilda? Hilda! Calm down, kids. Calm down, everyone. I want all of you not to panic. We will investigate what drove Hilda to commit suicide. For now, I want you all to go back to your classes. Go on. Neny. Neny, I'm freaking out right now. Does it have something to do with what you said that day? The black demon? I don't want to talk about it. Now, let's get back to the topic. Open your textbook on page 29 and do Exercise 5. What is it, Neny? - May I go to the bathroom? - Yes, you may. Neny, wake up! Wake up! Neny, wake up! It's me, Shila. What happened to you? Neny? Gie, open the door! Open the door, hurry up! Don't be scared, Neny. They just want to tell you something. Can you see them too? If you keep running away from reality... ...you'll be forever trapped in your own fear. But I can't, Gie. I'm scared. I just can't. I'm too scared. I can't. I can't. Neny. Look at me. You have to be brave, okay? If you keep running away from reality... ...you'll be forever trapped in your own fear. Hilda... Hilda... Hilda... Neny! Are you all right? - The demon is in the wardrobe! - What wardrobe? Neny... Speak slowly. That demon is in the wardrobe and I have to stop this. Shila, can I talk to you for a moment? I'm sorry, I was a mess yesterday. Actually, it still bothers me. I don't know how to tell you. - I'm afraid that you'd avoid me. - I wouldn't do that to you. Alright, then. Just tell me the truth. The truth is, yesterday Hilda was following me all day. What are you talking about? I don't get it. Please believe me. I can see things others can't see. And sometimes I can see when someone's about to die. Are you an indigo kid? When I was little... I had a vision of how my mother would die. The black demon killed her. Hey, sweetheart. Do you want to play with mommy? Come here, let's play. What's wrong? And that black demon is here now. And he killed Hilda. And I believe it's connected to my mother's death. Hold on a moment. It's not that I don't believe you. But if what you say is true, what is it haunting you for? I don't know. You freak! Neny, what's wrong? Violet will be the next victim. The black demon is targeting her. - Neny, she won't believe you. - But we can't just sit here and... Fine, fine. Let me talk to her. Stay here. Vi, we need to talk. Well, talk. Not here. What do you want? Hurry and tell me. I'm busy. I don't even know what to say. But you really need to be careful. - Because your life is in great danger. - Who wants me dead? The black demon. I don't know what you've heard from this freak. But I overheard your conversation in the clinic yesterday. You know what, I'm done with all of your bullshit. And stay away from my life. Bye, losers. I should've known. She's so stubborn. But we can't just let it happen. We should warn her. I don't want anymore victims. Let's follow her around. Neny, wait! Vi! Let's split up. You go that way, I go this way. Leave me alone! Vio! Vio! Excuse me. Let us through. Neny, are you all right? Neny? Vio's spirit is here. Mrs. Emil, the students are freaking out. And I even saw some of them calling their parents. I believe they'll be here at any moment to take them home. Announce a week off, starting tomorrow. Tell them it's a week off before mid-term exam. I think even if they're still in a panic state... ...they'll attend the exam in order to pass. I promise, I will investigate these series of tragedy with the police. Okay. Mrs. Emil. Mrs. Emil. Neny? Shila? What are you doing here? We need to tell you about something. It's important. Come in. Sit down, I'll get you something to drink. Ma'am, who is the girl? That's Anastasia, my daughter. She's pretty. I'm sorry I can only serve you this. It's not very often I have guests. That's okay, Ma'am. What do you want to talk about? It's about the incidents in Erly Dormitory School. It might look like some kind of tragic accidents or a suicides case. But the fact is, they were... ...murdered. Murdered? Who's the killer? I can see the killer and the dead victims... ...were killed by the demon. Do you have any evidence for your claim? All right. I'll try to investigate this case. But in the mean time, you should be focused on studying. You have mid-term exam coming. Yes, Ma'am. Then we'd better go. Thank you so much. - You go first. - Why? All right. Elena... If you know something, please give me a sign. Elena? Elena. Elena. Neny, wake up! - Neny? - Elena. The symbol. What's the meaning of this symbol? I don't know. You should ask Mrs. Sherly. She should know. Mrs. Sherly? Yeah, she's the Librarian. She's also known as the 'Walking Encyclopedia" of the school. This looks like a symbol I saw in a book we have here. Try to look in rack "D", second row. The title is "Necromancy History". Thank you, Ma'am. Neny Halianson? Yes, Ma'am. What is it? Sorry, but it raised my curiosity. Is it true that your mother's name is Sophia? You knew my mom? No wonder you look familiar. She was a regular visitor. She was a smart student. Go look for the book. Thank you. Gie? You'll find what you need to know on page 113. I'll let you know if I find anymore clues. Thanks, Gie. Necromancy is some kind of black magic ritual to raise the dead. The spell is known to be powerful. However, it needs to take 16 souls to physically raise the dead person. They need to summon a demon to collect the souls. The demon would then imprison the souls in some kind of urn. The Babylonians called the demon "Etemmu". It was created from shadow... ...and it was very scared of light. That's crazy. You should read this. Imagine, how many lives that demon has claimed all these years. We should find the urn. I know, but where? Hilda showed me a wardrobe. Maybe the urn is in a wardrobe. But who keeps it? We can't search all wardrobes in the dorm. Not all... ...just one. "Teacher's Office" It's locked. I think there's something back there. Stay here. You should look out for Mr. Arnold. Be careful. Neny! - Nenny, what happened? - We have to get out of here, now! Hurry! Go! Hurry up! What are you doing here? We're... We're looking for Mr. Arnold. Yeah, but we didn't find him. Miss, can I ask something about Mr. Arnold's wife? - Why do you want to know? - We're just curious. She died two years ago. Now, go back to the dorm. I still need to check other rooms. Two years ago? What? What's wrong? Neny, what is it? Don't tell me that I'm next. I don't want to die in the hands of that creature. Neny, please. Help me. No. We can't let this happen again. We should get help from Mrs. Emil. - She won't believe us. - We have the evidence. We'll tell her that Mr. Arnold is the killer. Mrs. Emil! Ma'am! - Just a moment. - Mrs. Emil! You two again? Come in. Sit down. What's going on? - I believe Mr. Arnold is the killer. - Arnold? Yes. He's been performing a ritual to raise his dead wife. Do you have any evidence? This is the borrowers list from the library. Two years ago, his wife died. And in the same year, he borrowed the book. And I saw he was acting weird when the students died. And I believe... Shila is his next victim. You're just drawing a conclusion. It doesn't prove anything. And how do you know that Shila will be his next victim? I have a vision. Mrs. Emil, please believe me. All right. But I can't promise you anything. I have to know the story from his side. Hello, Indra... Can you please send someone to find Mr. Arnold? Thank you. You can stay in my home until we find Mr. Arnold. I have to leave you for a minute. Neny... I'm scared. Don't worry. I promise, you'll be okay. Don't be afraid. They're just trying to tell you something. Mrs. Emil. Yes, Neny? Could you please excuse me? I have to go back to the library. There's something I should find. Please take care of Shila. It won't take long. I promise, I'll be right back. And you have Mrs. Emil here with you. Excuse me. Be careful, Neny. Shila. Sit down. Yes, Ma'am. I'll be right back. Gie! What's wrong? Why are you in a hurry. This is urgent. Have you found something important? Then come with me to the library. Let's go. Neny... Calm down. Hey, what are you doing? Isn't it obvious? Studying alone is not fun. So let me study with you. Sit down. I've been noticing your grades are declining. That shows that you didn't study hard enough. From now on, you have to study twice harder than your friends. Hey... Studying alone is not fun. Right, Gie? How about if we study together? Sophie, Gie, look at my grades! This is the first time, my mom complimented me. You should follow the examples from these students. They're head-to-head with their grades. If Anastasia keeps up her good grades... ...she could bump Gie from getting the scholarship. You can do it too. Don't forget to wash your hands after class. - There are many chemicals in here. - Yes, Ma'am. Gie, are you coming to Tasia's house? Mrs. Emil is cooking delicious lunch for us. I have to do something. Are you sure you don't want to go and celebrate Anastasia's birthday? Sorry, but I have to study. I need to use the bathroom first. Gie... I have to go. I'll be right back. Only weak are people easily satisfied. I didn't raise you to be a weak person. Enough, Mom! I'm not you! I don't want to be a woman left by her husband... ...because she was too selfish! You are nothing like me. Because you're too weak! Remember, Tasia. If you don't get that scholarship, don't ever call me your mother again. Happy birthday, Anastasia. May you be blessed with a long life, good health... ...and be your parents' pride. Amen. Thanks, Sophia. I should go now. Sophie. Open this letter when you're in the dorm. Promise me. Mom... Please forgive me. Tasia? Tasia? Tasia? Tasia. Oh, my God! Tasia. Tasia, please don't leave me. Please don't leave me. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Are you Ms. Sophia Larasati? - Yes, it's me. We're here to arrest you for Ms. Anastasia's death. Escort her out. Wait, Sir. Gie, the book. "Principal's Daughter of Erly Dormitory School Was Poisoned by Her Own Friend" Shila. Shila is your bestfriend, right? Please end this misunderstanding. Thank you, Gie. Where do you think you're going? Nowhere. But Neny has been gone quite long and I better... She'll be back before you know it. I'd like you to meet my daughter. - Your daughter? - Yes. Let's go. - Tasia, I want you to meet Shila. - Yes, Ma'am. I want you to get to know each other and I hope you can get along. Soon you'll be united. My wife, this is the fourth year. And for the past two years, I'm beginning to learn the pattern. Everything I've read in that book is real, not just myth. And I saw the victims with my own eyes. And she's one step away from raising her dead daughter. This is really crazy, but it's true. I've collected all the evidence. And if she refuses to cooperate, I'll expose everything. "Family Pick Up Body of Car Crash Victim" "Death of the Daughter of Erly Dormitory School's Principal" "Suspected of being Poisoned by Her Own Schoolmate" I found this in her room. This can help your alibi. Frans, please, I'm begging you, nobody can see this letter. Neny. Wind... Raise the spirits of the dead. Wake them up within the shadow of the night. Regain... Regain the breath that once severed. Bring the soul messenger back alive. Breathe... Breathe... Breathe... Excuse me, may I see my daughter? Her name is Neny Halianson. She just asked permission to visit Mrs. Emil's house. Mrs. Emil? Thanks. Shila, wake up. Shila! Wake up! Neny, I thought you left me. I will never leave you. Nen... Nen... Neny! Neny! Neny! - The urn! - The urn? The urn! Which urn? Neny! - Shila! - Neny! I won't let you go, and I will never leave you! - Let me go! - I will not let you go! Shila! Gie? Mommy? Mommy? Gie? Let's get out of here. Neny! - Dad! - Neny! Help my friend. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Hold her. - I'm gonna go get help. - Be careful! - Neny! - Don't move! You don't want your daughter dead, right? Calm down. - We can talk about it. - Be quiet! You've never known how it feels to lost a child... ...you had been working so hard for all your life. It was just a misunderstanding. I can explain everything. Stay away! Soon she'll join my Anastasia, who was murdered in cold blood. Nobody killed Anastasia. She commited suicide. - Do you think I'm stupid? - I have the evidence. It's all in here. Anastasia gave this letter to Sophia before she commited suicide. You can read it yourself. Daddy... I'm standing here, feeling lost. My bestfriends are like the sunshine in my life. Making it worth living. But my mother, on the other hand... She means the world to me. A safe place where I belong. I can't even begin to imagine losing any of them. And I'm just nothing. I'm just a twig standing in the middle of a crossroads. Forgive me for giving up. Maybe what my mother said to me is true. I am just a loser. I can never be like her. Forgive me. Forgive me for all my weaknesses. I hope my death won't be in vain. For the greatest people in my life... I love you all. She had always looked up to you. But she couldn't imagine to see Gie kicked out of school because of her. And Sophia decided not to give you the letter. She'd rather take all the blame, for the sake of her bestfriend. - Please, Madam. - It's too late now. It's all too late! Anastasia? Anastasia... We can start all over again, okay, sweetheart? We can start all over again. - Neny! - Ma'am! Anastasia is in peace now. You can't bring her back. Instead, you've brought a spirit who is not Anastasia. It's the evil spirit. Are you okay? Every mother has their own way to show their love and affection. Unfortunately, Anastasia misunderstood it as hate. I wasn't a good mother. I know you're tired. Come sit on my lap, sweetheart. Every friendship has its own sacrifice. And it comes from sincerity to understand each other. Because that's the main point of true friendship. So, Gie was your mom's best friend? She's our best friend too, now. Do you have any plan after this? My mother wanted to graduate from this school. And now, I want to follow her dream. We're together. Yeah. We're together. Let's go. My baby... Anastasia... I promise... ...we'll be together forever.
