Can I ride one? - Yeah, we'll see, if you're lucky. - (chuckles) Amy. - Hey, Jenny. - Oh my God. How many years has it been? - It's been a few. - Well, you look good. - Huh. Um, it's been a rough few days. I'm already getting stared at. - Well, it's been a while since they've seen you in town. (Amy blows kiss) Stop. You're gonna get me fired. (Jenny chuckles) - Sorry. (chuckles) - And this is? - This is my son, Adrian. - Nice to meet you, Adrian. - Can I get a cheeseburger, please? - (chuckles) Right to the point. I'll tell you what, I'll get that going for you.

(both laugh) Cut the shit. - It's, um... - (sighs) Come on. I care about you. You can talk to me. - We just didn't have anywhere else to go. - Who are you running from? - Huh. Um... Her name's Judith. - Judith? Okay. Who's Judith? - Adrian's mom. - But you are Adrian's mom. - His other mom. - Oh. Oh. - Yeah. Good Old Kathy would've should a brick if she was still alive. - (laughs) Would've loved to see her face. - Hmm-hmm. No, you would not. (chuckles) - So you and Judith adopted Adrian together? - Yeah, we got lucky. I got lucky. - So why are you running from her? (Amy sniffs and sighs) - Holy shit. Are you okay? - Yeah, just had a, had a little bit of a fight. - Do you need to see a doctor? - I'm fine, it's healing. - Are you sure? (exhales) So this Judith is a bit cray cray? - Yeah, would've, uh, given Kathy a run for her money. - Wow.

I have missed you. - (chuckles) I missed you too. - I'm so fucking sorry for coming back into your life a complete shit show of a disaster. - Hmm, oh. It's okay. (chuckles) It was getting kind of boring around here anyways. Needed some added spice. - Like I... shouldn't having me just unloading all of my baggage onto you. You have your own life. - Look, I wouldn't be here if I didn't wanna be. - (inhales) Thank you. (both chuckle) (glass clink) (Jenny exhales) Hey, I, um, I really appreciate you coming by and basically feeding us for the next month. - Oh, it's what I'm here for. (chuckles) - Um, I actually have something for you. Just... (Jenny laughs) (Amy exhales) Found it in the basement. - Look at us. Uh. - It's like peas in a pod. - Something like that. (both chuckle) (sighs) Well, I better get going. Hubby's gonna be calling soon. (soft dramatic music) Well, I will be back in a few days to check on you guys. - Sounds good. Drive safely. (exhales) Fuck. (pounds fist) (fire crackling) - Mom, why are we always sleeping on the floor? (Amy takes deep breath) - I guess I should get a mattress. Shouldn't I? - That would be cozier. - I'll get on that. See if I can get one from Jenny tomorrow. - I wish there was one in the bedroom that we can use. - Mm, no, that one was tossed out years ago. - Was it gross? (soft dramatic music) - It had cooties. - Ew. - (chuckles) Yeah. Now go to sleep. - Okay, Mom. I love you.

(sighs) Must be a squatter or something. - Squatter? - Yeah, hey have to be getting in somehow. - Mom. - What? - I wanna leave. - And where the hell are we gonna go, Adrian? We are miles away from town. My phone is smashed to shit. So no, we're not fucking leaving! We're stuck! (tense music) (hammer banging) (sighs) Okay, I don't want you coming in this room anymore.

It's my job to keep you well-fed, clean, obedient and beautiful. Beauty's a fragile thing. Like porcelain doll or a China plate. One false move and it can all just shatter.

Yeah, we're, we're fine. - I know when you're being a total bullshit artist. Holy shit. What happened? - It's fine. It's just some bruises, seriously. - Be honest with me. Was she here? - No, no. Uh, no, no. My, my clumsy ass just fell off a ladder fixing some lights in the master bedroom. I did have some of that Wild Turkey you brought by, but you know, my face broke the fall. I am kind of saying that it was inadvertently your fault from the... That was a joke. - Is that what happened? - Um, we were actually about to sit down and have some dinner, beef casserole. - I'm gonna be late for work. I was just stopping to check on you guys. - Yeah. Yeah, okay. - Thank you for the offer. Lay off the Wild Turkey. (Amy chuckles) Okay? - Yes, ma'am. - I'll be back in a few days with a new burner phone for you.

I'd have asked, of course, but you were sleeping like a little angel. - You gonna tell me where we're going? - Actually, I was hoping you could help me with that. - Oh really? - Yeah. Uh, Amy's parents have that farmhouse out here. Right? I never got to visit, what with her dad being in prison and her mom being dead and all, plus let's face it, I'm not really the kind of girl you take home to your parents, am I? (Jenny scoffs) So, what has she told you about me? - (sighs) Oh, you know. - No, no, I don't know. Enlighten me. - Just that you're batshit crazy. - Hmm. Nice. - Looks like she was right. - Maybe, but you don't know the half of it. - What? That you're an abusive bitch and Amy just wants a fresh start with her son? - Our son. Let's get that shit straight right now. And where's the fucking farm? - Go fuck yourself sideways. - Sideways. That's a new one. Listen, I gotta tell you, I am not one for games. Amy loves that shit, used to play 'em all the time. Give me a fucking migraine. - (scoffs) Well, there's aspirin in the glove compartment. - Oh cute. (blade clicks) I'm not fucking around. - Why can't you just leave her alone? - Because that boy is mine. I sacrificed too goddamn much to leave him now. - What did you sacrifice? Enlighten me. - You want one of these? - No. - Listen, I know you think you know Amy, you grew up with her in this shithole. Let me guess. Graduating class of 65. - 32. - (chuckles) Wow. Just know that whatever she's told you about me, nothing can compare to the way she is, nothing. I'm here to get my son away from her. - I've known Amy my whole life. (scoffs) She's nothing like you. - She ever tell you what happened to her mother that night? Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm guessing she told you that same bullshit story, all about how she woke up and caught her father taking a knife to her mother while she slept. - You're lying. - Am I? Because I'd be willing to bet what little money I have, deep down, you've known all along. I mean, come on. You saw how Amy's mom treated her. No fucking surprise she finally snapped and murdered that bitch. (eerie music) Now just imagine what she was like when she wanted a child of her own. There I was, ready to do anything to please her. Even when shit went too far. (eerie music continues) (Amy crying) (Amy sobbing) Oh, it's been a while since that's happened. So now you know, I won't hesitate to kill you and dump your body in that ditch over there. And don't think for a second that doesn't apply to your little waitress buddies at the diner. Do you understand me? Hmm? Now you're gonna take me where I wanna go. Okay? - Okay. (shift clicks) (engine revving) - You feeling better, baby? - Mom, do you think it's safe to go? Mom? - Stay behind me. Okay? (suspenseful music) Just stay close, buddy. (intense music) (wind howling) (door slams) (Amy gasping) (Amy choking and coughing) - Let me out! Let me out of here!

(wind whistling) - Tell me what? (The Woman snarling) (Amy gasping) (rain pattering) (car approaching) - Just do exactly what I tell you and you can get outta here without a scratch on you. - She'll never come to the door if you're with me. (rain pattering) (soft dramatic music) (Amy breathes uneasily) - I am so sorry, Adrian. You know I love you more than anything, right, baby? - I know. (Amy whimpering) - I saw you from across the street. Not far from where we lived. (soft dramatic music continues) (cries) I knew then that I had to have you, 'cause you were so beautiful, but I knew she wouldn't let me have you willingly.

Think of it like a family reunion. - What the fuck are you talking about? - You'll see. She's had loads of fun with me, but now it's your turn. (suspenseful music) So why don't you come out? I've got an old friend here for you. - Oh, you're even fucking crazier than I remember. - Fuck you! She's here! It's a two-for-one special! Come out! Come on out! Where are you?
