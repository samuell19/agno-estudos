[MUSIC PLAYING] Would I be presumptuous to say that our first dates been great? JILL: The night is still young. Well, the fundraiser wasn't so bad was it? Worse. The food was good. JILL: Ugh, horrible. Got to mingle with movie stars. JILL: Bores. It's not that easy to please you, is it? You'd be surprised how low maintenance I really am. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now that was incredible. - Spend the night? Only if you make me breakfast. Of course. And I mean you, not one of your servants. Well that'll prove interesting [GIGGLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, where's the fork gone now? Eww. You're not helping me at all by the way, you know. All right. [GIGGLING] Hey, maybe it's time to call 9-1-1. I can do this. I am not completely hopeless. [GIGGLING] Damn. You know this is not fair. - Oh. I study for this this morning. I watched the Food Channel. I can see how it really paid of. Let's face it, this food is uh, it's not fit for a dog. Oh. So let me ask you something. Have you ever been able to anyone eat a banana without turning it into a sexual fantasy? Hmm? Hmm? [GIGGLING] [MOANING] This is the part where you scoot everything off the counter and have your way with me. No problem. No one's going to eat anyway. [GIGGLING] [SQUEALING] [GROWLING] [DOORBELL CHIMING] Oh. Just ignore it. [GIGGLING] Go away. [DOORBELL CHIMING] I think you better take care of that before you take care of me. Great. Great. All right. [INAUDIBLE], keep an eye out. Mr. Turner. That's me I'm Detective Artie Monroe. This is my partner, Paul Fenwick. We're with the LAPD robbery and homicide division. Homicide? Has there been a homicide? Robbery. Last night your neighbors Mr. And Mrs. Swenson. Oh my God. Were you home last night? I was attending the function. I was home around midnight. Do you hear any strange noises coming from outside? I was uh, preoccupied. Is everything all right? Uh yeah, well no. There's been a break in next door. Oh. Morning. Good morning. This is my friend, Jill Akers. Your pancakes are burning. Is there anything else I can do you? No, uh we wouldn't want to keep you from your pancakes. Oh, uh, here's our card. If you can't think of anything else, please give us a call. Sure. All right. We'll do. Thanks. Bye. Nice life huh? Yeah. Yeah. What's wrong with you? There's something about that girl that is familiar. You were just blown away by those legs. I can't say I blame you. No, I've seen her somewhere before. Nah, she's probably some supermodel or something. Those guys are always going with those types. Lucky sons of bitches. Get in that car. - How 'bout I drive this time. - No! Shit. Jill? Jill? Where you going? What about breakfast? I should've never asked. You know, you're getting under my skin, [INAUDIBLE].. Good. [GIGGLING] Are there any reciprocal feelings,eh? Oh, maybe. Hmm, you don't really give anything away do you? Nope. Well uh, I'll call you. I you know what's good for you. [GIGGLING] [MOANING] Shaving. Can I watch? Knock yourself out. So I had a great time last night. That's it. What do you mean? I had a great time. That's all you can offer up? Well, what would you want me to say? Listen, I don't sleep with just anyone, you know? I chose you. And you should feel very privileged. [GIGGLING] And you're full of yourself. Tell me it wasn't the best sex you've ever had? Well, I've had some good times. Tell me. All All right, you were the best sex I ever had. You ruined me for every other woman. I close my eyes and all I can see is your beautiful face. Better. So you're going to come over to see some of her work today? I don't think so. You said you wanted to check it out. I've got a busy day. Fine. Are you pouting? You are. Isn't that sweet. Bugger off. I'll give you a choice. Either we can do it again right now, or I'll come look at your paintings? Choice is up to you. Screw the paintings. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Hey. God I'm starved. We gotta go shopping for food. Yeah, somebody better. So uh, were you flying solo this morning, or was someone actually helping you scream out like an alley cat in heat? Yeah. Um, God, I knew her name a minute a go. Oh God you're incredible. [GIGGLING] Dawn. That's it. Dawn. And where did we get this lovely prize? I went out clubbing last night, last call, she was the cutest unattached girl there. Well as long as you have your standards. So what about you Miss Society Thing? Details, give. Well, I had a great time. I noticed you didn't come home last night. Yeah, so? You're not the only one that can have a good time around here. Oh, good for you. It's about time you came out of your shell. Yeah, well, I don't know how far out of my shell I've come. I-- I'm just gonna take it nice and slow. Always the cautious one. Well, somebody has to be. I think I'm going to go see Sharon this morning. Mmm. I think I'm supposed to be working. I don't know. I've really got to start writing these things down. PAUL: Yep, I'll fax over the list of stolen items. Thanks. Let me know. All right. That was George from the rampart division. He's gonna keep an eye on his fences for the stolen goods. Fine. How about a murder case now? We're working a robbery. It's robbery-homicide. So why is it we've only done robbery? Don't you want a real case, something that requires some actual detective work? Cool your jets. Every case is a real case. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it-- it's a Beverly Hills robbery. It's cut and dry. Stuff has got to be fenced, and when it is, we'll grab the guy. Maybe when you work a little bit longer, you'll get a feel for what's a slam dunk and what's not. Whoa. Yeah. Feel like detecting something? SHARON: Hi, Jill. Good to see you again. Forgive me. I've got low blood sugar. Knock yourself out. So how are you doing? Fine. Mhm. How's the job hunt going? Not so great. Did you follow up on those leads I gave you? Yeah. But you'd be surprised how many people don't want to hire an ex-convict. Funny, huh? Nobody said it was gonna be easy. I know. Look, I have a friend. He owes me a favor. His name is Raymond O'Sullivan. He's got a small law firm, needs someone to help him out with the clerical-- you know, the phones. Swell. Hey, one of the conditions of your parole is that you become a productive and viable member of society. Oh, I can hardly wait. I'm only trying to help. I know. It's just you're still authority, and that just makes me bristle. Better the authority out here than inside, huh? Yeah. Raymond O'Sullivan. WOMAN: Oh, Raymond. Oh, Raymond. Oh. What do you like better? Me sucking your toes or the divorce settlement I just got you? Do to em what you did to my husband. Mrs. Stillwagon, I thought you'd never ask. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? Hello? Oh, excuse me. Well, so, um, yes, make sure that you get back to me on that thing. - Absolutely. Yeah. I'll draw tup the paperwork for it right away. OK? - OK. Um, and I'm going to put you down for a follow-up consultation for later in the week. You do that. Perfect. Excuse me. Another satisfied customer. Hi there. I'm Raymond O'Sullivan, attorney. How can I assist you? - Well-- Actually, don't answer that. Let me guess. You caught your husband cheating on you, and you want to take him to the cleaners. Well, you came to the right place because getting even with cheating husbands is my specialty. Well, actually, no. I'm from the parole board. Sharon sent me. She said you might have a job for me. You're the ex-con? Wow. You don't look like one to me. Listen, if this is going to be a problem-- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come in, please. So did Sharon tell you what the deal was here? A little bit. Good, good. Well, I kind of like running a loose ship. Um, I'm not a very uptight person, and I don't expect my employees to be uptight, either. I'm starting to build a nice little practice here. And it's a good thing you're getting in on the ground level. Thanks for the opportunity. Good, good. Well, why don't we just let your past be the past. And we'll-- well, you've paid your debt to society and all that. So we'll put that behind us and look towards the future. Thanks. Great. OK. Well, your desk is out there. Why don't you just go and dig in and make yourself at home? And we'll see what happens. - OK. Oh, uh, while you're out there, how about a coffee? Sure. Nope. That does not look like an ex-con to me. SHARON: You just missed her. You know where she went? Yeah. I sent her out on a job, first one since she's been out. Uh, you have an address? Sure. PAUL: Would you happen to know her whereabouts between 3:00 and 5:00 in the morning today? SHARON: No, I only know whether they show up for work or not. After that, they're on their own. Well, it's your job to keep tabs on them, isn't it? He's new, right? Uh, forgive my partner. PAUL: What did I say? Come on. Hey. For what it's worth, I think Jill's OK. She seems like the type who doesn't want to get back into trouble. [PHONE RINGING] Raymond O'Sullivan's office. Just a moment, please. Raymond, you have a Mrs. Finch on the line. Go ahead, Mrs. Finch. Miss Acres? Yes. You remember us from this morning? Detective Monroe, Detective Fenwick. I remember. I don't have any more information about the robbers. Why didn't you tell us you just got out of the joint after serving a nickel for robbery? You didn't ask. I remember when you were busted. I was there for the perp walk. You got the kind of face you don't forget. I get that a lot. Miss Acres, we need to take you down to the station for questioning. I'm at work. I can't. - Come on. You know the conditions of your parole. You can't refuse us. Hey, what's going on? Great. We need to question Miss Acres about an incident that occurred last night. What incident? I don't see how that concerns you. Well, actually, she's my employee. And I'm her lawyer. Great. Well, counselor, we can all go downtown if you want. I'd love that. Let's go. Raymond-- RAYMOND: Come on. It'll be fun. So she just happened to be next door when this robbery went off. That's all you guys got on her? That, plus the fact that this was the exact crime she was sent away for. RAYMOND: So? PAUL: So you don't find that a coincidence? She was with a guy all night long. How do you like that for an alibi? Oh, OK. So they were up all night, were they? RAYMOND: I don't know. Were you? For most of it. But he did go to sleep at some point, didn't he? Well, I guess we can ask him that. No, please. He doesn't know about my past. Isn't that interesting? I wonder what's in your past, detective, that you wouldn't want us to know about. Well, any hookers for freebie? - All right, you listen here-- - Oh, good, good. Attack the lawyer. Attack the lawyer. That'll look good in court. Paul, step outside. Artie, I've got-- Step outside. You better keep a muzzle on him, Detective. I'll handle my partner. Now, Miss Acres, we're going to have to ask your boyfriend about last night. He's not my boyfriend. I see you're in the habit of sleeping with strangers. Congratulations. This is over. Either arrest her or don't. What's it gonna be? She's free to go. Thank you. Come on. ARTIE: But we'll be watching. RAYMOND: Yeah, do that. You can also be watching out for a harassment lawsuit. You know, I can handle an interrogation. By beating up the lawyer? I wasn't gonna touch him. Just wanted to see him sweat a little. I think they're both sweating a little now. So I'll get my things together and be out of here in 10 minutes. Where are you going? Well, I'm leaving before you have to fire me. Nobody's firing anybody. Look, Raymond, I'm sure that when you offered to hire me, you didn't bargain for this. Listen, did you do the robbery or not? No. Well, then, that's all I need to know. Here. Can you file these? Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] Rough day, huh? Yeah, it sucked. Well, at least you got a job. And I lost a guy I really cared about. So I'm even, right? Listen, the last thing you'll have trouble finding is a boyfriend. He wasn't my boyfriend. Could have been. Now I'll never find out. Maybe your problem is that you shoot too high. What's that supposed to mean? Well, you meet some guy in some ritzy sitzy store. And he's got money, and he hangs out in society and all that. You know those types aren't going to go for our types. And what exactly are our types? Low rent. Oh, that's nice. Well, I mean, come on. Get real. We are what we are. You're a convicted con, and I barely have a pot to piss in. That's our lot in life. Yeah. I wanted more than this, though. So did I. And we can still have it. But you don't need guys like him, who are going to judge you. Maybe. I am what I am, right? Now you're talking, Popeye. Bitch. See, I'm right. That's why you always hate me. [KNOCKING] I'll get it. BEN: So you thought you could just blow me off, did you? Ben. Well, I believe we had plans tonight. Oh. Is this the rich guy? Ben, this is Angie my inappropriate sister. - Hi. - Angie, Ben. Hello. So, Jill, what about that date? Well, something came up. Do you mind? Go put these in water. Oh, OK. Ben, I, uh-- I don't think we should see each other anymore. We just started seeing each other. I know. It's just-- Has this got anything to do with the cops? - The cops? - Yeah. They came by my house, told me about your checkered past. So now you see why we can't see each other anymore. No. Actually, I don't. Uh, I heard their side of the story, and I'd like to hear yours. Ben-- Look, you tell me that last night meant nothing to you, and I'll walk out of your life forever. I promise. Your silence speaks volumes. Go on. Get dressed. We can't go out to dinner with you looking like that. Oh, Ben. Wait here. So I thought it was the quick and easy way out. I was wrong. But at least I only stole from people who could afford to lose it. You mean people like me? Yes, people like you. BEN: But you've put all that behind you now. I'm trying. It's the kind of thing that has a habit of following you around. How did you get caught? I was greedy, and I thought I was invincible. Oh, well, now you're starting to sound like me. - Why do you want to be with me? - It's funny. I was just about to ask you the same question. You first. OK. Well, I think you're smart and funny. And you have, uh-- you have this spark in your eye that I've never seen in a woman before. Maybe you're just hanging around the wrong circles. Oh. Well, maybe you should let me into your world. I don't know if you deserve a trip like that. BEN: Huh. I think I should be the judge of that. OK, your turn. Why do you want to be with me? Well, there's a kindness in your eyes that I haven't seen in a man in a long time. I think you'd be a good friend. - Friend? Great. Not friend. A good friend that would be a great lover. Why don't we just order some chocolate souffle to go and eat it back at my house? Well, what if I told you that I wouldn't wait? Check, please. [MUSIC PLAYING] I can't believe someone broke into my house and robbed me. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Steelwagon. I feel so violated. I understand. Now, did you remember to set your house alarm? Of course I set my house alarm. You think I forget a thing like that? I'm sorry. I have to ask. I don't think you do. Look, when I pay my taxes, I deserve some protection. You mean your husband pays your taxes. Ex-husband. And what is your point, Detective? Do you know where your husband was last night? In Fiji with his tramp. - I see. - Why? You don't think he had something to do with this, do you? I like to look at all the angles. I understand this isn't the only robbery that's occurred in my neighborhood. Apparently, the Swensons were robbed just two nights ago. And they live four doors down from me. I think you have a crime wave on your hands. I don't think two robberies constitutes a crime wave. Well, what are you going to do about it? We're investigating both cases. Well, see that you do. I'd hate to have to involve my attorney. No, there's no need for that. Well, just the same, I plan on contacting Mr. O'Sullivan and keeping him informed of the investigation. O'Sullivan? Yes, Raymond O'Sullivan. He handled my divorce. And he'll be handling all of my affairs from now on. We'll be sure to keep him informed. Uh, we will? And we'll let you know the minute anything breaks. See that you do. Friendly. So what was that, uh, all about keeping her lawyer informed? Her lawyer's Raymond O'Sullivan. So? So? Pay attention. Hey, that's where Jill works! [KNOCKING] We're looking for Jill Acres. I'm her sister. What's happened? Do you know where she is? Well, she was out all night. I expect her to come rolling in any minute. Mind if we wait? - Go ahead and wait. - I'm sorry. Miss? - Angie. - Angie. I'm Paul, and this is my partner Artie. Could I trouble you for a cup of coffee? It's just that I've got this horrendous caffeine addiction, and if I don't feed it, well, things could get ugly. Sure. Nice place you have here. It's a dump. Yeah, but for a dump, it's nice. Funny. So how do you like your caffeine, Detective? Oh, please, Paul. And, uh, straight up's fine. And him? Oh, he's all set. So how long have you been on the force? Uh, about, uh, four years. Wow, and a detective already. I'm impressed. - Well, yeah. When I was a patrol officer, I had some big busts. And, uh, they kicked me upstairs. It was PR. So what you're saying is that you didn't deserve the promotion. - No, no. Not at all. Actually, I'm a damn good detective. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Hmm. What? I was just thinking, I never did a cop before. ARTIE: How's it going? - Great. Shit, not this again. Could I have a word? Do I have a choice? So listen, I know about this place called Martini's. It's a pretty wild place. You think you can handle it? Oh, well, yeah, sure. I think I can. Uh, yeah. Well, you have to leave your badge at the door, you know what I mean? Oh, uh, that's no, uh, um-- sure. Call me before you wash it off. Let's go. Hurry up and get changed. Listen, do me a favor-- call Raymond and tell him they're questioning me again. OK. Tori Steelwagon, client of Raymond O'Sullivan, victim of a jewel thief. Chime in anytime you want. What do you want me to say? Another coincidence? Looks that way. What would you do if you were me? Burn that tie. Cute. Jill, don't say anything. Trust me, she hasn't said anything. Have you asked her all the questions you need to ask her? - For now. - Good. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hmm. Hmm. Gonad. It's a little racy, but, uh, 14 points. Jill, are you still with us? I'm sorry. It's just, um-- I don't know what I am. - Feeling OK? - Yeah. Can we not play anymore? OH, what is this, 'cause I'm kicking your ass? No, I-- just, will you hold me? OK. What's the matter, huh? I don't know. It's just like the world's caving in on me. At least in jail, it was horrible, but I knew where I stood. Out here? I don't know. Hey, look, you got off to a rough start. But, uh, there's no reason why you can't turn it around. Yeah, I wish it were that easy. It is. Look at this place. Do you think I was born with this? I wasn't. I earned it, every penny. Started with nothing. I know. It's just-- it's just so hard. Maybe we should go away this weekend, you know? Give you a chance to clear your head. I can't. Come on. A couple of phone calls, next thing you know, we're on the beaches of Aruba. It's tempting, but I don't know. Can I let you know? Yeah, sure. It's an open invitation. Can use it anytime you want. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Hey, there. Hey. Uh, I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd-- well, I saw these. And-- Oh, aren't you sweet? You know, it's a lot more comfortable if you come inside. PAUL: Oh, sure. So, uh, Paul, can I pour you a glass of wine? Are you off duty? - Oh, yeah. That'd be great. Uh, let me. Wow. What a nice surprise, you being in the neighborhood and all that. Well, yeah. Are you usually in the habit of visiting women that you hardly know in the middle of night? Oh, well, you know, it was just I-- I thought we connected this afternoon. And-- And you couldn't get me off your mind. I know. I get that a lot. Come on. I'm flattered. I've been thinking of you. You have? Yeah. Listen, let's not beat around the bush. We both know what we want. We do? Yeah. You want to screw me. Easy there, cowboy. - I'm sorry. - Relax. Look, I don't like playing games. You wouldn't be here if you just wanted a friend. You want to do me. That's cool. I want to do you, too. Now, we can go round and round, play the dating game, and end up in bed, or we can just jump there right now and save the rest for later. Wow. You're really something. [MUSIC PLAYING] Jesus. Can't you guys give me a break? - I'm sorry. I-- I think you have the wrong idea. No, what I think is that you have nothing better to do than harass me! Maybe if you go out and do some real police work, you'd find out whoever pulled off these heists. No, you don't under-- Hi, Jill. Another late night in Beverly Hills again? You know Paul. Uh, I'd better go. What's going on here? You owe me dinner. I'll call you. Oh, my god. You know, you've really pulled off some dumb stunts in your life, but this takes the cake. Takes the cake? Who talks like that. What are you doing with him? I don't know. You're the older sister. You're supposed to know. Oh, my god. I-- I just can't believe this. Relax. I don't want him here! Listen, I pay half the rent here, so I don't think you can tell me who I can and cannot bring into this place. - Oh, fine. Slap me in the face! Quit being so dramatic. Angie, he thinks I'm guilty. He's probably here just to snoop around or plant some bugs or something! I'd love to hear those tapes. This is not a game! Look, we both know you're innocent. So that's the end of that. Paul is a very good-looking guy, and he's great in bed. Can't I have a little fun? Oh, fine. Have all the fun you want. Could you send a bill to Mrs. Landers for me? Her husband will be paying my fees. And make sure it's a 30-day notice. Sure. Oh, and cancel my 2 o'clock 'cause I want to get a game of squash in after lunch. Sure. And my office is on fire, so could you call 911? Sure. What? Just seeing if you were paying attention. Oh, I'm sorry. I just have a lot on my mind lately. Don't let this business with the cops get you down. I'll take care of that. It's not just that. It's-- I don't know. I-- I think I'm having a harder time adjusting to the real world than I thought I would. One day at a time? Yeah, right. RAYMOND: I mean it. Now cheer up. That's an order. Oh, I thought you might want to take a look at this. What is it? College course catalog. Night classes. Thought you might want to expand your horizons. Thanks. Why are you being so nice to me? Because I know what it's like to be scraping around for a break. I'm not offering a handout, just a hand up. Thanks. I think you got potential. Just don't prove me wrong. Morning. Morning. Working late last night? Oh, same old, same old. How about you? Watched the game and fell asleep with the TV on. But at least I got here on time. - Oh, Artie, you know, I just-- - Save it. Take a look at this. - What's this? ARTIE: A good detective plays all the angles. Oh, rap sheet for Ben Turner. Arrested for robbery. But he wasn't convicted. ARTIE: Hmm. The case was kicked out on a technicality. But it's just the one arrest. That's enough. Ain't this a pretty picture? Two cons working together. Now what makes you think they're working together? Just fits. Maybe he did the jobs by himself, and he's just setting up Jill to take the fall. Interesting theory. Hey, just playing all the angles. Let's go over and talk to Jill, see if she knows about his past. Uh, Artie, you know what? I'm just buried in a ton of paperwork here. Uh, you think you can handle this one? Get here on time and you could be caught up. PAUL: You know, you're right. Absolutely right. I'll call in. [BUSY SIGNAL] Hey. Now, before you go flying off in a huff, I'm-- I'm not here to talk about you. Yeah, right. How much you know about this Ben Turner character? Ben? Yeah. I don't see how that's any of your business. Well, I'm sure your PO would like to know you've been consorting with felons. What? ARTIE: He was arrested for robbery, jewel robbery. You're lying. Yeah. It's all part of a master plan-- make up rap sheets on innocent citizens. When was this? 10 years ago. Some slimeball lawyer got him off, and he's been a model citizen ever since. Of course, you've got to wonder how he pays for that lifestyle he's got going. He's an entrepreneur. Yeah, sure he is. Look-- No! You look. The more I spend time on this case, the more it stinks! Now, I intend to close it. Right now, I got two great suspects. Maybe they're working together, maybe they're flying solo. I don't know! All I know is when you trip up, I'm gonna be there to catch you. So this is the part where I'm supposed to get all scared and crack up, tell you everything? I don't think so. Spare me. Suit yourself. But I'll be watching. So what happened? She made like she didn't know. Was she lying? I'm not sure. So what now? Now we stake out. Stakeout? Yeah. You get the first overnight shift starting tonight. All right. He's gonna get greedy, and that's when we catch him. I can't believe he lied to me. Well, technically, he didn't lie to you. He just didn't tell you everything. Oh, whose side are you on? I'm just saying. It's true. I mean, I thought we were building something here. You can't trust anybody. Don't you think you're overreacting just a tad? You don't understand. Look, what I don't understand is why you're sitting here telling this to me when you could be telling him. I thought we were taking a break from each other tonight. I had to see you. - I'm flattered. - Don't be. What's the matter? Why didn't you tell me you had been arrested? Oh, Christ. You know with all these robberies and my past, don't you think the cops would have a field day with this? I'm sorry. Why couldn't you have been honest with me? I was honest with you. Uh, because, uh-- Because why? Because I thought you'd throw me away. I-- I figured if you knew that I had a record, you'd have nothing to do with me. Do you know how much trouble I could be in? Look, when it comes to you, I-- I don't think very straight. I think you're really special, and I want to be really special for you. Well, you could have told me. I'm sorry. From now on, no lies. The police think we're both involved in this crime wave. Really? Yes. Hmm. It's either one of us or both of us. Hmm. Ben, tell me you weren't involved. Jill, I'm not involved. That's good enough for me. Hey, what's up? Angie, what are you-- you can't be here. Why not? Would you just get in the car? You're on a stakeout, aren't you? How cool is that? Please, if they find you here, I'll be in deep shit. Relax. I won't stay. How'd you find me? Well, I was dropping off Jill at Ben's, and I saw you from across the street. You know, you really need to work on this stakeout thing. You're not really good at it. Angie, would you please-- Did I spill coffee on you? I'm sorry. It's-- it's fi-- I got-- it's fine. I got it. Ooh, looks like I got your attention. I'm on duty. I know. That's what's got me so excited. See? Please don't. Oh, we already are. Seeya. Wait. You're on duty, remember? Call me later, stud. That's it? [MUSIC PLAYING] You're cold. Sorry. Did you go outside? Yeah, I, uh-- I went to let the dog out. Oh. Go back to sleep, honey. So how do you like the job? It's OK. Raymond's really nice. - Oh, yeah. He's a real peach. Can I ask you something? Shoot. What do you think about me going to college? - I think that's a great idea. - Really? Yes. What are you considering studying? Well, I don't know. I thought maybe I'd take some general courses first and see where it goes. I think that's great! See, I told you you could adjust. Oh, yeah. That's me, queen of adjustment. Uh, speaking of which, I got a call from Detective Monroe. My shadow. He told me about Ben Turner. He was never convicted, which means I can still see him. I'm not saying you can't see him. I'm just saying watch your back. I always do. Another robbery right outside the house you were staking out! I swear, I don't-- I didn't see anything! Yeah, well, that's obvious! If the thief snuck in back, what am I supposed to do? You should see the chunk of my ass the captain just chewed. I had to beg him not to send you back on foot patrol! You did that for me? You just save it! This thief is playing games with us, and I don't like games. So what do we do now? ARTIE: Rattle the cages. Oh. Ben Turner. Now what? We have a warrant to search your home. I'm sure my attorney will have something to say about this. He can say whatever he wants. We're still searching the place. OK. MAN (ON TV): Everything from action and sports to pop, rock, and dance. JILL: [GASP] Oh, my god. [KNOCKING] Who is it? ARTIE: Miss Acres, we got a warrant to search your apartment. Um, just a minute! Don't you guys have anything better to do? Afraid not. Fine. I want a thorough search. You got it. Just don't break anything. ARTIE: You'll never know we're here. There. Can't say I never buy food. What's going on? We're being searched. Oh, yeah? Hiya, Paul. Hey. Mmm. Chili. I'm starved. Uh, no. Don't do that. Why not? It's not done. Well, I'll be the judge of that. Oh, you're right. It's not done. So, uh, Paul, how long is this gonna take? As long as it takes. I'm sorry. I-- Detective, concentrate on the search. Mmm. Smells good. Family recipe. Ow! Place looks clean. - Yeah. Sorry to disappoint you. We're still watching. Knock yourself out. What the hell's going on? How did this get in here? You're just lucky I found it before they came over. I guess I am. Thanks. That's all you have to say? Look, this is my business. No, wrong. You live with me, it becomes my business! Relax! I'm not gonna get caught! Oh, my god. I don't believe this. What's not to believe? I'm sick of living in this dump, OK? I want out! Besides, I'm just taking after you. Oh, and you plan on going to jail just like me? We're done. As soon as I fence this in, we can get out of town for good. You got it all planned out, don't you? - Yeah. - No. I'm not watching you go down, and I'm certainly not going down. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna try and make this right. What's up? I need to ask you a legal question. OK. Well, you came to the right place. Shoot. OK. Suppose there was a robbery, but the police never caught the thief, and then whatever was robbed was put back. Was there ever a crime? Where is this question coming from? Please. OK. Technically, yes, there still would be a crime. But if the people who were robbed get their stuff back and they drop all the charges, then the cops have nothing to do but twiddle their thumbs. Thanks. That's what I thought. Uh, Jill, are you in some kind of trouble that I should know about? Attorney-client privilege? - Always. - No. I can't believe you're gonna do this. Just be quiet. Look, we're clear. We've got this stuff. Let's just go. No, don't you get it? Once you get caught, that's it. There's nothing you can do. It's over. Now, I'm paying for what I did. I'm not gonna let that happen to you. I did this for us. Yeah, and that's exactly what I'm doing. [KNOCKING] Did you forget your key? Oh. You didn't give me a key yet. Paul, what are you doing here? Well, I guess you're not the only one that can surprise someone. Really. Is this a bad time? Yes. I mean, no. Come on in. So what's up? We need to talk. OK. I mean seriously. So talk. We can't see each other anymore. I mean, it was really fun and wild and crazy and all that. But it's just my job's too important to me. I can see the way things are going that this is really starting to affect me. I just want to be upfront with you. OK, cool. - So that's it? - Yeah. I mean, what more do you want me to say? I don't know. I thought you'd try to talk me out of it or something. Well, I thought it was fun fooling around with you. You're kind of square, and I had fun pushing your buttons. But you're a cop. And, well, you don't know-- it's just not my style. So you're saying you would've dumped me. Yeah, but I probably would've sent you an email. I hate confrontations. OK. So, uh, we're OK, then. - Yeah, we're cool. - OK. [BEEPING] Saved by the beeper. That's Artie. I better go. Yeah. So, um-- So listen, if I get arrested, can I tell 'em I know you? - Huh? - I'm just kidding. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] Jill. Ben. What's going on? It's a long story. ARTIE: Nice look. Look, I can explain. Yeah. I knew you'd trip up sooner or later. Cuff her. So we got a statement from your boyfriend. Now it's your turn. What did he say? ARTIE: That's not how it works. You talk, I listen. Well, did you find me with any stolen goods? No. So basically what you're saying is you arrested me because I like to wear black. And you were carrying these. Oh, should get the chair for that. We can be cute all night, or you can fess up! You're right. I'm tired of playing games. - Good. The reason I'm dressed like this is because I was trying to turn Ben on. What? Yeah. Our sex life, it's gotten into kind of a rut lately. And, well, I was trying to spice things up. All this talk about cat burglars, I-- I thought I'd sneak into his house and surprise him. You see, Ben has these sexual fantasies. And-- kind of kinky stuff, you know? I'm just giving him what he wanted. - Sex. - Yeah. You should try it sometime. Might put a smile on your face. Hey. Hey. You OK? Yeah. Thanks for coming to get me. You're my big sister. I'd do anything for you. Somehow, I don't find that so reassuring. Look, as hard as this is for me to admit, you were right. I was wrong. I was looking for the easy way out. Yeah, and we both know where that gets us. I'm sorry. Hey, I forgive you. But you still have to get a job. - Bitch. So? So she had the same story as him. So they're not lying. They're just screwing. Now you're being cute with me! I'm sorry. Detective, these messages came in while you were interviewing your suspects. They got their jewelery back. All of it. So I take it I'm free to go? Yep. Thanks for all your help, Officer. Uh, Detective. Whatever. I've had it with this case. I think I'm gonna take a nice, long, hot bath and forget that any of this ever happened. Glad you can move along with your life. Hey, come on. I thought we were cool. No, you're right. We are. I guess I could use a hot bath, too. You need something. Hey. That was fast. I thought we were gonna leave together. Well, I'm sorry I didn't include you in on my plans. What's wrong? Oh, I'll be in the bathroom not listening. Jill. What's going on? What do you want? I want to know what's-- what's going on. Ben, I saw the way you looked at me when you caught me outside. You thought I was the thief. What exactly was I supposed to think? I thought you trusted me. I do. Why can't I trust you? Do you know why the cops let us go? Because we had exactly the same story. What? Yeah. You were performing a sexual fantasy for my benefit. Strange thing was, however, we never compared stories. Little more than a coincidence, don't you think? I suppose. Maybe it was because we think alike and we were meant to be together. Hmm? You really think it's that simple? Yep. So are we gonna go somewhere warm, or just, um, sit around here and wait for an earthquake? Hmm. ANGIE: Ask him if I can come, too. Can my sister come, too? Absolutely, as long as she has her own room. Deal. [MUSIC PLAYING]
