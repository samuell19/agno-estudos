Somar presents AT LEAST LET ME CLIMB THE PALM TREES a film by Lopes Barbosa I shall sing to you the song of the "machamba" black workers gathering at night to play sad songs speaking of suffering from being away from their families, the families they visit with their voices on stretchers. I shall sing to you of a sky with dark clouds, black like the skin of the "machamba" workers, a sky with stars of splendor, that deep night which is the life, the dark life of the black worker. I shall sing to you of the sound of the iron bar hanging outside the big house, the sound that sends out commands and leads people in herds to dig up land with hoes, to the black swamplands to which the "machambas" extend. I shall sing to you of the sweat that drips down their faces under the watchful foreman's eye, the despair of feet nailed to the earth where the sun falls onto bent-over bodies. I shall sing to you this sad song, the song of black "contratados" (forced labor) Work! Work! You there! More strength in those hands! Don't stop! Go on! You! Fanha, Fanha! This is a place of work, you hear? You may serve lunch. It's ringing! Let's eat! Poverty has reached me, poverty has reached me... Madala! How is everything at home? Everything's fine. They call us lazy but we work every day in the machambas (tilled fields) and there's so much sun. And the way we plow there's no time to rest! Better let him go. The foreman is evil. He's delaying. That's no lie. Madala! Let's eat. Madala, your daughter is over there and wants to speak to you. Good afternoon, Father. - Good afternoon, Daughter. Maria, I went to pick up your father for you to see him, but because the foreman was eating nearby I just told your father you're here. Maria, how are the people back home? Madala, it's better to speak in the shade. There's no sun there. Maria, go into the shade and take your father with you, there's no sun there. What are you looking for? Are you going with Madala? You shouldn't, Madala is old. Just like Djimo. Maria, are you going with Djimo? No, I'm not going with Djimo. But you'd like to sleep with him. Madala, let's eat. People who work in the field need to eat when it's lunchtime. Dad, I think you better go eat. And you don't want to eat anything? - I ate in the canteen before I came. When I was passing by, a friend of mine saw me, bought some stuff and said, "Take it, this is for you," and I ate. Are you going to hit me? Aren't you hungry now? Don't you know I have to support you? No, Father. What that person gave me left me satisfied. I'll wait while you eat. Madala, what your daughter is saying is appropriate. Alright, I'll eat, and you wait for me here. Madala, do you want me to do anything? Madala, are you sure you don't want me to do anything? I'll do it with pleasure. Madala... Madala! Madala, don't look over there! Why did you do that? Why? Why? Didn't you like it? Madala saw us. Don't talk nonsense. Drop by the camp and I'll give you the money. What's going on here? Didn't you hear the ring? Did you hear what I said? You motherfuckers! You motherfuckers! Did you hear what I said? Madala, tell us what to do! Speak and we'll put an end to all this right now. He might kill us, but we're not afraid of dying. Madala, we all saw what he did to your daughter right in front of you! Say what you want us to do! Madala... Madala! Madala... I didn't know she's your daughter, I'm your friend. Madala, if you prefer, you don't need to work this afternoon. Stay in the camp and talk to your daughter. Madala, we all saw what he did to your daughter right in front of you. Madala... Madala! Drink a bit of my wine. Madala, don't be a coward! Let's work, it's already time! Let's go, it's later than 1:30 already. Pick up the hoes! Maleisse! Elías! Alberto... Pick up the hoes! Where are the plowers? Harvest, let's go! Stop at the forest river! Matisse, give water to the cattle! Sasha, come with me! Everyone to the field! Motherfuckers! Didn't you hear me? Let's go, I said! Back to work or I'll shoot you in the head! Motherfucker! You motherfucker! You motherfucker! You motherfucker! Oh my child, oh my child. Where are you going, my child? Who will I stay with? Oh child, where are you going? Hoe here! You, Djimo, go over there! Fanha, Fanha, move! Go! Get away from there! Work over there! You forgot this back part here! Hey, you! Can't you see that part? You, over there! Can't you see what you're doing? It looks like they're playing rather than hoeing! It's too little! You're working too slowly! Work quickly! Keep working that way! Motherfucker, what are you doing? With more force! This part isn't very well cleaned! You over there! Further forward! The way you handle that hoe... Fanha! Why are you standing still? Hey, you! Get down! You! Clear the way! Further back! Clean right there. Aren't you listening? Madala! Are you resting? Wait and see! Hey! Madala, wake up! Stand up. Go work! Can't you hear? He's dead. He's dead. What's happening? Madala is dead. Get two men and take him to the cellar. The others can carry on working. Yes, sir. You take the old guy home. You take the old guy home. It really hurts! It really hurts! But let's bury the old man... Madala's body was big like a true man's. His courage was manly like that of a new branch. Madala was simple and anonymous like a honeycomb. Madala had blood in his veins, which many didn't know. He had a heart in his chest, which many didn't know. He had tears to cry and laughs to laugh, which many didn't know. He dreamt like a boy of building kingdoms, which many didn't know. Let's dress him up. My husband is gone! It really hurts! But let's bury the old man... It hurts so much to bury the old man... He was the first to die. It hurts so much to bury the old man... Despite the pain, he set forth. Let's meet there... We're left without him, but let's bury him... That is why I acknowledge you, Madala, as accurate and necessary as the trunk of a baobab between micaias and ant hills. With you, I fulfill myself living in huts and compounds extracting from steady rocks the slightest mineral and winning inch by inch the right to work the land. And with you I go ahead. And with you I'll be standing on the floor, held by the bursting dawn tomorrow to greet the day for it is the day to meet the promised. Then, stones may roll off the mountain, fruits and seeds may be burned and springs and rivers may be withdrawn as in the fever I have in the middle of this brazier. I'll still be able to recognize you, Madala. Even after your death as a symbol of an entire people.
