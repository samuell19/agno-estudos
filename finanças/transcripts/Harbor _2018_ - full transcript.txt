FIND HARBOUR FOR A DAY Okay, listen now. Mr. Quéré is going to give out caps. And you will have to wear them during the whole journey to London. I want to see you with them always on. Miss? -Even when we sleep? -Do you expect to sleep? In English, please. In English, please. And put the cap on. Who's Laurent? "No way you can have Léo this weekend. "It's not my problem if you're away with your students..." -What? -Eliott, give it to me! Give it to me! I'll keep an eye on you. -Are you okay? -I can't stand them anymore. It's not the worst class. No, it's me. Even good students get on my nerves. I should have turned down the trip. Here you go. Come on! Where did this one jump from? -And here is mine. -Thank you. They're all here. Keep it on. Adèle! We need to move. Let's go. -He's not in our school... -Come on! Let's go. Hello. I knew these had to be your students, but I couldn't see you. -Thank you. -Have a safe crossing. Keep moving. Don't cross the line. -Adèle, is Eliott with you? -What? I can't find Eliott. I can't believe it! -They're all on the other side. -Except one. -We counted them. -He must have stayed behind. Okay, you can go. I hope I'm not disturbing you. No, it's okay. Would you like one? Hurry. You're holding everyone up. Your cap. What's the problem? Wait. Should I count them again? -Go. -Thank you. Next is Eliott, 8014. -I don't want to hear about you. -He's got a cabin for himself? There's a bunk left in his cabin. Do you want it? No. I'm not sleeping with that twat. No... Come on, boys! Please don't start! I'm only saying it once. Lucie and Coline, 8013. Thanks. At the cafeteria in half an hour. Cabin 8016, Tom and Thibault. You forgot... Maxime. 8016. It's a cabin for three, isn't it? Come on. Go upstairs. I had no choice. -He's here now. -You've got to stop this, right now. I don't know... Take him back. Say you didn't see him board. I can't do that. -I'm going with you. -No! I can't believe it! It's a serious offence. You know what they could do to us? Where is he? We need to find him before departure or I'll go crazy. Hey! Excuse me! Are you planning to sow them all around? He was on his way down to the bilge. It's strictly prohibited. Keep a closer watch on them, okay? What's wrong with you? We've been looking for you! We can't waste our time looking for students! Sorry. This won't happen again. Well. Tell them they cannot play hide-and-seek here. See what you made me do? From now on he's your problem. What's your name? You're not very talkative, are you? Come. Miss, we're wondering... who's the new boy? Nobody. It's none of your business. He just arrived. He's from another school. Wait. Where are you going? -We're done. We're looking around. -No way. Have you heard the instructions? Nobody on the deck. -But Miss Martin said that... -It's too late. Understood? Wake up time is 6:00 am. Everyone back in their cabin, lights out at 10:00 pm. Come. Eliott! Have you lost it? Stop this right now. And stay away from... Maxime. What's the problem with you? Go to your cabin, now. You should not talk to anyone. It's not safe. All right? Sit down. I leave my cabin. It takes the whole night to go to England, you know. You have time to get some sleep. School... Thanks. Shit! Sorry, Eliott. Everything's fine. Go back to sleep. Romain. Open up. Some students left their cabin. I'm worried. Girls, go back to bed. -And the boy, too? -The boy, too. You made a fine mess, Adèle. Bullshit! What you did was dangerous! I want to know who shouted "man overboard". -Did someone fall? -No. Your students pranked us. And we started our search. What's wrong with you, for fuck's sake? -It's not us, it's the other boy. -Who? The new boy. Where is he? I can't take it anymore. I can't. -Stop. -Don't tell me what to do! Will you bring me the boy? That's enough. He doesn't speak a word of French! -Romain! -Listen, I did it. -I was just joking. I thought... -A joke? Are you kidding me? You'll never stop being a pain, will you? Come here. You go back to your cabin. Go ahead. I'll handle it. You're not supposed to be out here. Because of you, the captain had to stop the boat. This isn't a dinghy, it's a ferry, goddammit! If I were you, I would lay low from now on. Now scram! So, what's next? Will there be charges? I must inform the authorities. You'll know upon arrival. He went out to get some air, he shouldn't be far. Don't mind this, please. Eliott. Why did you do this? And you... why are you doing this? Stop it. I told you not to leave your cabin. Are you mad or something? I just want to help you! Still awake? There's room in here, if you want. You're going to sleep here. Okay? Coffee before they wake up? No, thanks. Your attention please. We have now reached Portsmouth, one hour and thirty-five minutes behind schedule. We apologize for the delay... Yes, François. 5th floor. Your attention please. We are arriving in Portsmouth one hour and thirty-five minutes... Ladies and gentlemen, please proceed to the exit. Thank you. You think they're here for Eliott? Here's his ID. Mr. Quéré's going with you. Go through customs, we'll meet on the bus. Where is he? Hold this. I'll be right back. Excuse me, are you looking for something? Come on, let's go.
