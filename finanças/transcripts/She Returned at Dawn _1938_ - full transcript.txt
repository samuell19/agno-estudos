She returned at dawn Anita's lucky. - He's handsome but he isn't funny. No need to be funny when you're handsome. Are you happy Karl? - I'm glad you're my wife, Anita. And you, are you happy? - Very happy. Why are you smiling? - I smile because I won't be on the platform at midnight to see the Budapest Express. You understand, Anita? - Yes, Karl. When I get married, I'll surely go on a honeymoon. If you don't travel then, when would you do it? Karl couldn't leave his post. His work is too important. And we're happy here. I'm very happy. - Is he tender? He kisses you often? - He's a good kisser? - It's none of your business. - I imagine quite well the first night... ... regarding each other, one should look stupid. The groom should be more stupid than the bride. - Did Karl look more stupid than you? - You're teasing me. I want a husband who will cuddle me all the time, that's why I will marry actually. I want one who will buy me fine dresses just like the ones in the catalogue. I see, you're still not ladies. - So you are? - Yes I am. I'm free. I do what I want. Later if everything goes well, we'll buy a washer. I don't mind doing the laundry. It strengthens the arms. You're sweet, Anita. Instead of a washer I would prefer a radio. Chief, Central Budapest on the phone. Good morning, Anita. - Good morning, Pali. Anita, Do you... you... - Do you... you... What? Since you got married last year I'm confused sometimes. - What's confusing you? - I'm confused about calling you 'tu'. What do you mean? - I don't know... Since you're the wife of my chief I wonder if I should call you 'vous'. You're right. It must be 'vous', it's more formal because of Karl. But it feels so odd to me right now. We will start next week. - Next week... Anita, I have something else to ask you. Something else? Tell me. I've known you since you were a baby but I don't dare do anything anymore now you're Mrs Ammer. - I've changed so much? - No, you haven't. - So what? I would like to be named first porter. First porter? You're the first because you're the only one. I know but in the future... If one day the Budapest Express stops at Tahya, a second porter will be hired so I would like to be the first. It'd be great around the village. - Count on me. Being first porter is not like being a station master but it's close. Would you like to be a chief, Pali? - I don't know if I would like that. If Karl hadn't been chief, Would you have married him, Anita? Of course. I married Karl because I loved him. You loved him? - Yes. - Pardon me. But we never see you in the woods at night nor near the river on sunday. Karl is on duty. I'm glad that my duty doesn't require me to stay night and day at the station. The night train noises don't keep you awake? You get used to it, you appreciate silence better after. I live far away from here. I've got a house. A small house, of course. I've got a pretty bedroom. A small bedroom, of course. And a small garden. It's quiet, deeply peaceful. When I return home in the evening, the birches quiver in the wind. From now on, the Budapest Express will officially stop at Thaya. - The Budapest Express? - A success for Osten. - Great. Budapest confirms that Osten's request has been agreed. I'm gonna be first porter. The Express 475 will stop daily at Thaya at 12:45. - Will it stop for long? - 6 minutes. So we'll have time to see it. - When will it stop for the first time? - Friday. You'll have to wear your golden cap every day, the Sunday one. Of course. But which one will you wear on Sunday? From Friday, every day will be Sunday. Here is Mr Osten. - He's come to break the news. Done. The victory is complete. The Budapest Express 475 will stop at Thaya. Thanks to my father and I, you become Mr Ammer, station master of a main station. Splendid! Amazing! I would even say... moving. That's it... moving. Mrs Karl Ammer, congratulations! Overnight you become the lawful wife of a senior official. Let's get organized quickly because an Express is a somebody. An omnibus is... ... a snail. How funny I am. We haven't got bunting. Too bad. We should always have bunting in reserve. We need refreshments too. We need sweets, newpapers, fruits... For its first stop, I wonder if it would be nice to put up a banner: "Welcome to the Express 475 and its passengers" What an idea, I find it charming. Or a better one... Listen. "In honour of the 475 and its passengers" Top-hole, isn't it? I'm so pleased. "In honour of the 475 and its passengers" In honour of the 475 and its passengers. Alright. Everything is ready. Absolutely, absolutely. It's passing the 760 kilometer marker. It passed the 760 kilometer marker. It passed the 760 kilometer marker. - It's coming. I'm coming! You're late, the Express has been announced. I'll wash my hands and I'll come right away. Go behind the level crossing. Don't stay here. Stand over there. Mr Osten must have luggage. - Everything is ready, chief. Bunch of idiots. Bunch of idiots. Have you got any luggage, Mr Osten? - My driver will take it to my car. It will be done. - All is fine here? The station is overrun by the crowd. I'm pleased. They're nuts to have us stop in this dump. Thaya. Did you ever know it before? - I've never seen it for this long. Thaya... Six minutes stop. - Where are we? - At Thaya, sir. Six minutes stop. - It's a spa town? - If you like. It depends on the day. I want one like that to scare the crows. What's the name of this station? - Thaya, Madam. What do you sell in Thaya? - Chocolate, fruits, cigarettes. Do you have the latest fashion reviews? - Fashion magazines? No. So there's nothing. Why does the train stop in that dull station? The Osten chatelains requested that the Express stop at Thaya. Charming. They own a paper mill 5 km from here so... Thanks my dear child. 27 telegrams today. - That's nice. Not including phone calls. The passengers didn't seem pleased to stop at Thaya. Passengers are never satisfied. - Did you see the chic lady? Station masters have no time to look at ladies. How beautiful she was. And her dress... It must be a dress from a big city. From Budapest. How beautiful this woman was. In fact, maybe she was pretty because of her beautiful dress. It's the first time I've seen such a pretty dress. And also in the train carriage... ... that man who looked at me. He was beautiful too. Some men on trains are beautiful. Hanover... ... Budapest... ... Here, Thaya. Do you have a letter for me, postman? - Who would write to you? Nothing for you. But I've got a telegram for Anita. For Mrs Ammer. - A telegram? What does it say? - How would I know? Hello chief. The mail. And a telegram for Anit... ... for Mrs Ammer A telegram for you. - A telegram? From where? From who? I don't know, I haven't opened it. - I'm coming. With a telegram, you can't say what it's all about. - It's urgent and important. - Yes. A telegram addressed to Mrs Ammer. It's strange, isn't it chief? Well, open it. So? An inheritance. I'm to inherit. Aunt Berta Helman - Deceased - STOP - Why 'STOP'? - Go on, it's an english word. - Funeral ceremony - - Tomorrow 11:00 - STOP - You're expected at the offices of Beaumann for the reading of the will. Signed: Beaumann. I'm telling you I've read the telegram. Her auntie, Berta Helman, passed away. She's to inherit a huge fortune. I've read it. It's fully spelled out. With a lot of 'stops'. Come to Budapest at once. Inherit 100.000 Frs. And when I say 100.000 Frs perharps it's 120.000 Frs. And maybe 150.000 Frs. It's a fortune anyway. So it's a huge fortune. That she could buy the station with. Anita, here's the wreath. If Aunt Berta could have seen it, she'd have thanked us. 60 Frs. How beautiful you are, Anita. - How do you like my little hat? Like this? Like that? That way? Wait, I would like you to start over. - That way? That way. It really suits you. Look at my fur. It's nice. What is it? I don't know but it's pretty. You understand I can't go away. So I'll go alone? Don't worry, the hours will fly. You'll arrive in Budapest tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. You'll return by the 283 train at 6:00 p.m. - I'm scared. - What could happen to you? A decent woman has got nothing to be afraid of as long as she remembers she's a decent woman. If a man follows you, cross the street. If another one stares at you, you frown. Finally, if an insolent one accosts you, call a policeman. Do you understand? Yes, I cross the street... ... I frown and I call a policeman. Perfect, everything will be fine. I put the wreath in. You didn't forget the note with the directions? It's in my purse. You must take the No.68 tram from outside the station. - Yes, I know. And in the evening at 6:00... - So as not to be late, I'll be there at 5:00. - The wreath is on the luggage rack. - Thanks Pali. Bye Karl. - Aren't you going to kiss me? - Sorry. Goodbye. Don't worry, nothing will happen to you. - Absolutely nothing. Goodbye. Now, our station shall seem tiny to her. That's completely ridiculous. I forbid you to put it around my neck. - It's not my fault, it slipped. - So you say. - Playing such a trick on the living. - It's funny. It's not my fault, it slipped because of jiggles. And it smells bad. You should have put it away. I'm used to travelling but it's the first time I've seen such a black joke. A wreath... and why not a bier as well. Come in. You're in Budapest too? Indeed, good morning Mr Osten. - A funeral? - A great aunt, I received a telegram. It isn't really a pleasant trip. - There is also an inheritance. An inheritance! So it will be less gloomy. May I? That wreath is gorgeous. But it will take ages on the 68 tram. At that hour, trams are packed with workers. I'm early, I can take a tiny detour to drop you off. - But I don't know if I should. - Why yes, of course, here is my car. What will you do with the money? Mr Ammer, my husband, would like a station buffet. Great idea. Smoke doesn't bother you? - No. Have you been to Budapest before? - Yes, once. I was afraid of the houses, I was such a little girl. That can't have been so long ago. What are you doing tonight? Could I show you the nightlife of the capital? Thank you but I'll be gone. I'm going back to Thaya on the 6:00 Express. Your husband didn't allow you a day to visit the city. It's ridiculous, it's tyrannical. A young woman like you needs some freedom. You must be bored in Thaya? - I've got a lot of work. As you wish. We would have had a pleasant evening. This wreath is pretty. It would had been an opportunity to see the fashionable places in town. You've got the day to change your mind. Promise to think about it. Take my phone number. Whether you leave or not, call me. Agreed? - Alright, I will call you Mr Osten. Good bye and see you tonight. Lovely girl. Anita, you forgot something. - How funny, I left you my wreath. - Hurry up, the notary is waiting. See you tonight. You're charming. Damned main station. What's going on? - Nothing. It's only a package I can't manage to find. Since we are a main station, it's a two-man job. I'm overwhelmed. - I know how tireless you are. That's true. By the way, any news from Mrs Ammer? I don't expect any. She's probably at the notary's now. - No. By now, she's at the cemetery. I thought we're going to the notary's office first because afterwards things would be more cheerful. I mean... less sad. Have a seat, please. The deceased asked... The deceased asked in her will that you should maintain her tomb carefully. - It goes without saying. - Of course. It's the least we can do. If she hears you she'll be pleased that she didn't forget you. - She was a good person. I bequeath to my beloved cousin Mayer... - That's me, sir. ... 4.250 Frs. - Thank you, sir. I'm not the one to be thanked, sir. To Emma, my faithful servant... - That's me, sir. My respects, Madam. ... who has always taken care of me... - My legs are still swollen, sir. Yes, I see. ... who has always taken care of me, 1.125 Frs... Good heavens! ... and my old shawls. - They're moth-eaten. To Spiegel, my land in Himmelstòk in it's entirity. But it's worthless. To Anita, my niece, 8.000 Frs. This is Madam Berta's last will and testament. Deceased on 12 june 1938, at age of 84. I ask you to sign this paper and I will give you a cheque from the bank of Budapest. Here's yours, Mrs Ammer. But I thought I would get cash. - It's uncrossed. You can cash it at the bank. At the bank? Yes, write your address on the back to endorse it. She's privileged and she doesn't even know what a cheque is. - The dead are unjust. - You hardly knew her. But now I know her better. Do you know where the bank is? - No, I don't. It's easy. Go down there then turn right, take the first street on the left, then the second on the right and if you get lost, you can ask a policeman. A sweetcorn, please. You're too young for jewels, Miss. Diamonds are for old ladies. If you like, I can offer you a ticket to the cinema. Madam, you'll get your dress tomorrow morning without fail. ... with the garnet red bolero. It's about the blue dress in the window. - First floor, Miss. Thank you. Wonderful. It looks as if it was made for you. It's amazing. You've got a model figure, slim-waisted, a well curved lower back. A dream size. My size. I mean my size when I was 20. It's a pleasure to dress you up. Customers like you are scarce. Just look at that back. It's impossible not to admire you. By Saint Stephen, father of Hungary... Sonia, Renata, Eliuka come quickly. Admirable, she looks like a fashion plate. But... what is the price? Our dresses have their secrets, their prices are our mysteries. We sell at a loss. The new laws, insurance, labours. It's astonishing how much you must pay an apprentice. And tailors... Do you know this dress was made by a parisian? We gave him a bucket of money. We made every concession to him. France dresses the world and french people undress it. This one costs 3.000 Frs but it suits you so well. It'd be such good publicity for us, I'll let it go for only 2.500 Frs. 2.500 Frs? I appreciate it but... I would like to think a little bit. Because 2.500 Frs... I will come back tomorrow maybe. - Tomorrow, it will probably be sold. Eliuka, undress miss. No, please, you will tear it. Some advice Miss, with a dress like this one you mustn't wear a chemise, a slip is quite enough. Here's your purse and your hat. She's got a lovely breast. - But it's not enough to buy a dress. - Who's got a lovely breast? - A client. But all our clients have a lovely breast. Did you show our newest hair clips to Madam? I'm showing her our latest models. So I'll come back tomorrow. - Poor girl. - When you're 20 years old you're rich. To the station. I'll give you a tip if I don't miss my train. Always the same fib but I'll trust you. I'm going to Thaya, my husband's waiting. If I miss my train I'm ruined. Why didn't you say so? I know where the station is but where is Thaya? I need my map. - No, Thaya is my village. If I miss the train, I'm ruined. - So let's go for a lost cause. I'll come back tomorrow. Tomorrow, it'll be too late. You must leave your hair loose. With an evening dress, it'll be prettier. Like that it's ravishing. You're charming. We always returns to our first loves. We're more engaged to a dress than to a lover, we get rid of them faster. 5 minutes more and you'd have found a closed shop. It's true that 5 minutes late never hurt anyone. No changes are needed. It fits you like a glove. You make it greater with your hairstyle. Now that it's properly combed. We will pack this pretty dress into a nice box. I would like to keep it on. As you wish Miss. How funny. So, we'll pack your old dress. But your shoes don't match. You need evening shoes. Come, we've got some gorgeous ones. - 1.000, 2.000, 2.100... - This dress never looked so beautiful. - You've got a nice figure. - Your hairstyle is lovely. - You'd be a princess with this. - 400 Frs. - Here a charming bauble. - 800 Frs. - It goes with your hair color. Miss? I think I'm going to faint. - Fainting? My smelling salts! Here they are. Inhale. Are you feeling better? - I couldn't stay on my feet any longer. Are you... I mean maybe you're expecting a baby. - A baby? - Three or four months. There isn't any baby at all. I'm just tired. So take an aspirin and get some sleep. Get some sleep? Yes. Keep it, you never know. 5.75 Frs. I would like to make a phone call. - This way. Over there. The phone is here. Yes... but who's speaking? Anita? Ah... Mrs Ammer. Sorry, I didn't recognize your voice. Still in Budapest? - Yes, I missed my train. You missed it. Fine! - I didn't miss it intentionally. Pardon? Yes. You're so kind. - Great. You couldn't go back like that. It would have been ridiculous. Tell me, where are you staying? - At the hotel. Where should I meet you? - Pardon? The address? Which hotel? I'm at... the Grand Hotel. At the Grand Hotel? Well... Alright, I'll be at the Grand Hotel. Pardon? ... in the lobby. Understood. I'll meet you in the lobby, Anita. The Grand hotel... She's done all right for herself. May I take your package up to your room? No, thank you, I will take it back later. Countess Smolky? Countess Smolky. No, I don't know her. - You're not the Countess Smolky? - No... No. - So you're not her. Cigarettes, Madam? No Miss, I don't smoke. I have never smoked. 80.000. It's worth 300.000. It's a bargain. No, I don't want it. No, no... Not you. Is it really you? I didn't recognize you. Beyond recognition... ... You've changed beyond recognition. Phenomenal. Do you mind if I admire you? You're really Anita Ammer? - Yes, I'm Anita Ammer. What a real surprise! I would even say a pleasant surprise. I'm thrilled to have you here tonight. Cigarette? We'll have an astonishing night. Let's go. You're in a great shape and so am I, believe me. The dress suits you... ... A true masterpiece. - Where are we going? - Close your eyes and follow the guide. First to Catherine's. There is a barman... Another Martini? - Yes, it's good. It warms me up. You've got bad eyesight? - Bad eyesight? It's a monocle. Of course I don't wear it at Thaya. People are too stupid. They don't get how chic a monocle is. But in Budapest, it's a must have. Try it. Really sexy. Look at yourself in the mirror. Lovely. Excuse me Miss, I'm too hastly, I'm used to... But you know you're divine. Thaya doesn't deserve you. Nicolas. Raph. And Joe. You're wasting your life with Osten. He's nice but... slow. A Seltzer water brain. It fizzes. I'm a bit dizzy. You've known her a long time? - We've been together for 3 months. Such a woman... ... with such a body. The Venus de Milo... ... with arms. It's funny what I said, isn't it? - Yes. Yes, I'm lucky. I get it. Osten is pathetic. And to think that you've been with him for 3 months. I'd love to see you tomorrow. Is it possible? - I'm dizzy. - At five. - I'm terribly dizzy. - I'll pick you up at the hotel. - At the hotel? - Yes, but don't mention it to Osten. He's a friend. We must be fair. I adore you. Osten is disgusting. He told me all you have done together. I already know you've got an adorable little body. That moron gave me a thousand details. - Did he? We could fly away. - Fly away? - To my house. - Strange idea. - We could drink. - I feel sick. - Actually I'm an expert in sickness. I will cure you. It's midnight. The bewitching hour. Midnight? Midnight. It's midnight. Every evening at this hour it's midnight. - The train has pulled into the station. - She's drunk. She's funny when she's drunk. She sees trains everywhere. Come on, we're going to the casino. Midnight. I should have... - ... gone to bed at midnight? Nobody does that anymore. She's what they call a squiffy bourgeoise. Midnight. In my heart, a tender hope is growing, a swallow sang upon my roof. In my heart, a dream made its nest, flowers seem to blossom for me. But roses must fade, the sparrow will fly away and dreams will abandon sighing hearts. What does it matter, everything's singing today. May ours laughs rise in the night. In my heart, a tender hope is growing, a swallow sang upon my roof. In my heart, a dream made its nest, flowers seem to blossom for me. I do not understand. Don't worry, chief. She isn't used to it, she only missed the train. Someone should have gone with her. No, I should have gone with her. Why has she missed the train? Why? Something must have happened to her. I've a bad feeling, Pali. Don't be worried, chief. - And you, aren't you worried? - I? Well... ... No chief, I'm not worried. - Yes, you're worried. Yes chief, I'm a bit... ... a little bit worried. Hello? Yes. Yes. Pardon? On track 3. Thanks. Sirs, place your bets. Are your bets placed? No more bets. Place your bets. Are your bets placed? 28. 17 single... splits... ... corners... - Monocles aren't allowed. Silly me, monocles aren't indeed allowed. Sorry, my mistake. I said 17 single... corners, splits, double streets, column and dozen bet. - That's all? - Yes, that's all. 24, black, even and high. - I won! - Go on. I lost. - May I? To bring you luck. - Of course. In this case... - Madam, you're going too far. Cashier, a chip dropped here. Whose chip is this? - No. It's mine! - Nonsense, Madam! Sirs, keep quiet! Place your bets. How strange for us to meet again here, isn't it? I'm trying to remember where we have met before. - I'll tell you. - Who is he? - I don't know. - What did he say? - I couldn't hear. No more bets. I'm tired. Take my seat. - What's the matter? Are you leaving? - No. This child is crazy. Leaving while she wins. I don't understand. Let's go to the bar for a while. Nobody's there, we'll be alone. Those people are pitiful. Betting make them tremble. I lost again. Now she's gone, I'll lose everything. Pick up your chips and stop playing. My name is Keith. Tell me where we know each other from. Barman, two Champagne cocktails. Make it three. You were on the train. I was looking out the window, you looked at me from your compartment. - Yes. - Yes but where? - At Thaya. - Thaya? - Yes, Thaya. Your Express was going to Budapest. I was on the first floor of the station. You caught a sight of me and you smiled at me. You... - Yes, I get it. I get it. Yes, you were at the window with your hands folded. Yes, I think so. It could be, I often fold my hands. I remember seeing you and I thought... Guess what I thought. - But I don't know. - I thought... ... it's such a shame. - You thought that? - Yes. I get it But my child, tell me what you were doing in this station. Well, I am... ... I was Mr Karl Ammer's wife. - Karl Ammer? - The station master of Thaya. - Of course, I got it. No more little town, little station, little trains and no more station master too. The big city welcomed you. You've lost your husband between Thaya and Budapest. - No. - Don't protest and don't be ashamed. You've got to live your own life and nothing else matters. - But... - We'll have thousand things to talk about. - Will we? - Let's dance. What is your name? - Choose a name for me. Tabeh. It's nice, I have never heard it before. It's a Malaysian name. You've met another woman named Tabeh, haven't you? No. I travelled a lot. I had sobered up and now I'm dizzy once again. - And we forget everything. - It's nice to forget. Let's go onto the terrace. I don't like the look of that drunkard. He's drunk like me. Like you are. Tipsy people never like drunkards. Listen. I don't want any trouble with those you came with. Where shall I reach you later? - We'll leave together. - No, we better not. I'll catch you up. Where do you live? Speak. Where are you staying? At a hotel? - At the Grand Hotel. Fine. I'll go first and I will meet you there. Your room number? - But... ... We'll meet in the lobby. - Why? Don't you trust me? - Yes, I do. - I do but... - OK. In the lobby. - That's it. But... You must come. Yes. I'm counting on you. My apologies for having taken madam away but we're old friends. Aren't we? - Yes. Here are the 4.000 Frs you won. Put them in your purse. I must go. I don't feel well. I must go right now. - I'll escort her. - Let her go, please! - As you wish my dear. I'm old enough to escort her, mind you. You mean you're drunk enough to escort her. What a dirty little minx! I won't get in your car, I'll go back to the hotel by myself. - My dear Anita... - I'm not your dear Anita. But ... Madam, I've come to fetch my package. - Which package? - The one I left earlier. Did you have a good time? - I don't know. It isn't safe to keep such a precious thing in a purse. Yes but... Drop it off in the hotel safe tomorrow. Meanwhile, slip it under your mattress and sleep on it. I used to do that when I'd got savings. Thank you. I confess I'm not staying here. - I know but I am staying here. - Ah you... - Yes, I'm here with my wife. - You are married? - No. I said I was waiting here for my wife, I was so certain to meet you. You are my wife. Pull yourself together. We'll take the lift. Tell the desk that madam has arrived. - Yes, Count. Thank you, that's all. Mineral water and some fruit. You came and yet you don't know me. - Indeed, I don't know you. You aren't cold? Do you want me to shut the window? No, I'm not cold. Earlier, in my purse I found... - Hush! Leave it. Come and sit down. You must be very tired. - Yes... ... No... I don't know. Get some rest. Just a little. Here, lie down. - Here? - Why not? Don't you trust me? Yes. I'm glad you came to meet me. You're a good little creature. Now, you must sleep. What is it? - The water and the fruit. Alright. Thank you, Count. What are you doing with that necklace? - It's pretty. Don't play with that. - It's yours? Maybe. Put it back in your purse and forget about it. I would like to sleep with it. - No, you can't. And... it brings bad luck. I'm glad I met you, Tabeh. You're beautiful, very beautiful. You must sleep. You're a child. - I'm 18 old. - That's what I said. A tiny child who lives in a tiny station. I don't know where I live any more, or where I come from. I read in a book once that all women were expecting a man. You're the man I was expecting. I won't go back to my station where trains never stop. Don't be foolish. I would have loved to live the way you do, peacefully protected in a hole. You don't realize how lucky you are. - Keith, take me away. - Yes. We'll ride big trains that never stop in tiny stations. We'll take some you don't even know, shiny trains which run through entire countries for days and nights and boats and planes too. We will go far away. What is it? - Nothing, Tabeh, nothing. They're looking for you? - Who could be looking for me? A woman, another woman. - No, there is no other woman. why are you so afraid? - Leave me be with your fears. I'm not scared. Nothing scares me. Listen. It's upstairs. Someone's walking. Ah, yes. When I was a child, I was afraid of the dark too... ... and little by little I fell asleep. That's it. Sleep Tabeh. Sleep a while and then... ... tomorrow we will go to countries you dreamed of. - Far away? - Yes... far away. Far away. - Are you there, Keith? - Of course. I'm here. Don't move. Pretend you're sleeping. You, don't move. You were having a good time? I understand. You've got a cute dollface. How strange, I've never seen you before. You've been together for a long time? Answer. Bitch. Bastard, Bébert, you bastard. You'd rather I kiss her? Swine. You will pay for that gunshot. From a better place, I wouldn't have missed you. Congratulation on your acting skills. You got to have an ugly mug to be able to change it so easily. You should be in movies, you would be a star. You've already reached the top. Bébert, this girl is not with me. - No? Maybe the maid has forgotten her after making up the bed. Give me the girl's purse. Bébert, she's got no part in this. - Perfect... Perfect. So, she's not with you but she's in your bed, she's got 8.000 Frs in her purse and a diamond necklace. I put the diamonds in her purse without her knowing because it was unsafe for me at the club. She wasn't aware she was bringing them to the hotel. I wanted to climb down the facade once she was asleep. 5 minutes more, I'd be gone and you wouldn't have caught me. With those 8.000 Frs, I'd have easily reached the border. Believe me, it's the truth. - Really?! So the kid has only been used for bringing the diamonds back? Funny... I lied to her, I spun a yarn. I beg your pardon, Tabeh. As you see, I'm a crook, a rascal. But a rascal who was moved by you, I swear. I wish I could go away with you, Tabeh but I met you too late... ... or the cops came too early. Come on, don't faint. Now the bracelets, they go with the necklace. Two years in jail. They will fly by, don't worry. - Look out, here they are. - She's quite young. - They're cuffed. - He's tremendously handsome. - What a pity, so young. - She'd got the necklace. That necklace intrigued me. It was so fishy. So young with such a jewel... ... A genuine one. - What does that package contain? It seems pretty rounded, chubby. - Maybe the victim... - ... cut in pieces. Don't make trouble get in the car. So then your name would be... ... Anita Ammer. You pretend to be the wife of a so-called Karl Ammer station master of Thaya? - Yes. And you just met tonight the international thief Dick Farmer. Yes. Of course you know nothing about him, about his robberies, his troubles with the police all over the world. - I didn't know. - You didn't know... Yes. Then tell me why did you pretend to be his wife at the hotel? - I don't know why. - You don't know... ... but maybe you know why you went up to his room. I don't know. I followed him despite myself. I couldn't help it. Being naked in his bed, you couldn't help that either. I wasn't naked. - He was respectful. - Yes. Shut up. And the necklace? Finding a 2 million Frs necklace in your purse seems normal to you? Either you're a complete idiot or you think I'm a simpleton. I gonna find out which. Conrad, call Thaya. The train station at Thaya. No, I don't want you to. I don't want you to call Thaya. I beg you, inspector. Don't call. I told you the truth. Don't do it. I'll do whatever you want. I'll confess whatever you want. Please, do not call. I swear I did nothing wrong. Nothing... Nothing. Enough, you're hurting me. You're cutting of my arms. It hurts so much. Take her handcuffs off. No, I don't want you to. You mustn't call. Put me in prison... ... kill me... but don't say a word to Thaya. I did nothing wrong. I only missed my train. He mustn't know. Don't hurt his feelings. No, inspector. I beg you inspector, do not call. I won't call. But on one condition. Listen to me. On one condition: you gonna confess right now that you're his partner in crime. Yes. You worked with him. Yes. That it's you who stole the necklace. Speak. Be a good girl. You stole the necklace. Yes. Fool. You couldn't have said so earlier? Finally it happened. Write down her confession. - Yes, chief. No, wait. Wait, wait. Call Mr Osten, he knows everything. He was with me. Yes... with me. Conrad, call this man. - OK, chief. Anita Ammer? That's right. Police station? I'll be right there. Right away. Right away. Right away. Right away. Yes, inspector, that's right. When she took a cab to meet Dick Farmer, she was drunk? Completely drunk for sure, she even slapped me. - She slapped you? - Vigorously. I didn't say a word because she was fully loaded. I mean she was dizzy. You're a gentleman. I think so, inspector... ... a gentleman. - Thank you, Mr Osten. - At your disposal, inspector. Good bye Madam. Good bye Anita. Thank you. Don't worry, I know nothing. I never met you in Budapest. Thank you. Give me my jacket. Your night-time acquaintance has just poisoned himself. - Poisoned? - Yes. If you want to see him, you can. He's dead? Yes. He's dead. Don't be afraid. He's quite dead. He was a great thief... ... but not a coward. I don't want... I don't... Bébert, give her a cognac. I would like to leave. - You can leave, you're free. It's 5:32. There is a train at 6:00, you can catch it. Give her her purse and her package. You'll see a doctor, won't you? Do you want your face to stay like that? It's cold, isn't it? - A cigarette, chief? What happened? - Pardon? Why didn't you return yesterday? You missed your train? - Yes. You should have called. -Yes. What's wrong with you? Go up to the bedroom. I'll give the signal to the train. How much was your legacy? - Legacy? Yes, Aunt Emma's legacy. How much did you get? 8.000 Frs. You didn't lose it? No, I spent half of it. I'll be right with you. You can explain it to me. What's this? The handcuffs... ... Yes, the cuffs did this to me. Handcuffs? What handcuffs? Have you gone crazy, Anita? What happened? Speak. Nothing... Nothing happened. I can't remember. I might have missed my train. Yes, that's it... ... only by 2 minutes. 2 minutes ruined me. We think 2 minutes are nothing. Go on... Speak. I can't remember. A man came in my compartment, he laughed... .. but that wasn't him. No, Keith is dead. He was a thief. Where did you sleep? I didn't sleep. I was at the Grand Hotel. Countess Smolky... ... I was the Countess Smolky. And in my purse, a necklace. A diamond necklace. I didn't sleep. We played roulette. 24 was the winning number. That was a big city, very big. I'm too small for big cities. We drunk champagne. A lot of champagne. A lot of champagne. Anita, look at me. Listen to me. Look at me, listen to me. It's me, I'm Karl. You're gonna tell me the truth now. On the train this morning, you slept and had a nightmare. You're telling me that nightmare. You didn't miss your train yesterday. It's a lie. Cousins Emma and Spiegel kept you. You wanted to celebrate the legacy. You drank too much. Why don't you tell me the truth? Why didn't you call me? You should have called me. You should have sent a telegram. You know I was all alone. I was so worried. You can't imagine Anita... ... how dreadful it was. I didn't know where you were, what you were doing. I shouldn’t have let you go alone.
