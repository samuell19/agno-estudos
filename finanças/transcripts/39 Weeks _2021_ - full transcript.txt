I don't understand what's happening. I-I'm bleeding and I'm just... What's gonna happen next? I mean, I was feeling fine, and then I went to the bathroom and I... Oh, God. That sounds like you're having a miscarriage. Is that it? Is this pregnancy just like done? This is the end? I don't... Well, what... What happens now? Babe, babe. Listen, I need you to calm down, okay? I'm looking it up right now. Okay. Take a deep breath. You are going to have the most beautiful baby at the right time. You need to just let yourself feel all the feelings. And when you're ready emotionally, physically, mentally, you'll try again. First of all, I'm gonna need you to stop looking things up on the internet. I am your doctor. If you have any questions, you can come to me. I know, but I read a couple of articles so I know what the charts look like. And I just... Look, I'm gonna stop you right there. We've already frozen your eggs. You are young. You still have time to find a partner. I don't want a partner. So, if you're good to take my money, I'm good to go. You can put your legs down. Everything looks great. You still have time. You sure you wanna do this alone? I've done everything alone. People are disappointing. If you want it done right, you do it by yourself. It's a kid, not a coffee order. Ever since I was 12, I told my parents that if I hadn't found the one by the time I was 30, I would just do it by myself. I waited four extra years. I'm smart, I'm reliable, I'm productive. And I want a baby. And I'm not gonna wait, for what? Some idiot man to break my heart and ruin my child? I'm sorry. Look, I want a kid more than anything, but I want it on my own terms. Well, then, the next thing to do is to find a donor. I actually already went through the database and I found someone. 4-7-3-1. He's perfect. He meets my criteria and he has a great essay. Well. It sounds like you've got it all figured out. If you're sure, then just make an appointment with the reception. -Unless you change your... -I won't. Well, we're really excited that the deal went through. I promise he's not a diva. Hello? Okay. Bye. Do you remember that indie they were producing that you read for? You booked it! Yeah, I know. Shoots next week. Okay, great. Well, congrats. Bye. Happy birthday! Monica Reyes sent these over for you. I also tried making the doctor's appointment, but they said that you already called and did it yourself. You know I can do my job if you let me. Yeah. No, I know. I just, uh, had a little extra time, so I figured that I would just take it off your plate. I am literally here to take things off of your plate. How did it go? And before you say anything, can I say something? Don't do it. Just don't do it. You're a fucking beast! And you're only growing. Why do you need to do this now? Thirty-four is young! And, honestly, why would anyone want to bring more people into the world? We're overpopulated, were selfish, climate change is at its tipping point. You really wanna bring a child into the world? I know I don't. Okay. First of all, you're a guy. So, you don't have, like, a biological need to procreate. And second of all, this is my birthday present to myself. So this is what I'm doing. You're gonna ruin your life. Don't you have some phone calls to make or something? You already made them. Go get lunch. I don't want Thai. Okay, guys. She's here. Hide, hide! Everybody hide! Hey, Eva bear. I love you to the moon and back and I'm so excited for what this year is gonna bring. Hey, she's here. Hide. Hey, girl. Hi! Are you surprised? -I said no surprises. -I know. Happy birthday, Eva. Happy birthday, Eva. Happy birthday, Eva. ♪ My eyes get wide♪ ♪ My temperature is rising... ♪ -So, I made this cupcake extra special for you. -Thank you! And I got you this. Thanks. "Enjoy the journey." It's an intention bracelet. Just wanna get to the destination already. It's not about the destination. It's just one big journey. Okay. High chats with Skye Sommers. Alright. I'm only a little high right now. -Do you remember deep shit Eva Garcia? -Mmm-hmm. -It was really good. -It was hilarious. And I would take it easy on the cupcake because it's like 30 milligrams of THC in it. What? Why? I don't know. I just thought you could use it. It's like your last week of freedom. Holy shit. I can't feel my face. Okay. It's not cocaine. You got your drugs confused. No. I'm all tingly inside. Babe, that's physically impossible. Why are we laughing? Oh, my God! I can't remember. Wow! You know what's crazy? -Mmm? Oh. -Family. Because you're really starting your own family. But you have a whole entire, like, other family. - Dysfunctional. - Yeah. I don't even have a family. But I have you and you're like family. Are you really ready to have a baby? -Yeah. -Good. Because I'm gonna be there every step of the way. I wanna help raise this child. I don't... I don't know. That's a lot of responsibility. I don't... I don't think I need all of that. I think I'm just gonna... -figure it out on my own. -No. No. You need help. You always wanna do everything on your own. But raising a child takes a fucking village. Don't you fucking follow me! This set is not what I signed up for. Okay, stop. Start again. What happened? You look like shit. I looked like 5:00 a.m., dickhead. What happened? Yesterday, I worked a 15-hour day. You know what that means? You're putting my life in danger. Other guy in the trailer, he asked me for coffee. He fucking asked me for coffee! I'm gonna call them, and I'm gonna call you back. You're gonna pick up. I'm number one on the call sheet! Everything okay? Shit! Hi, Mauricio. How's production going? Shit, this is just... You wanna get dinner at some point this week? Look, I'm not trying to be a dick here, but we're not dating. Just because we fuck a lot, doesn't mean that we're doing anything else. Can you calm down? Was it something that I said? You said you were gonna treat my client with some respect, and if you don't, he's fucking walking. Do you understand what I'm saying? Eva, listen, we love Mauricio, you know that we love him... Look, it's not you, it's me. Or, you know, whatever. Eva, are you still there? Without my client, you've got no funding, no audience, no God damn movie. Do you understand? So you have to fucking fix this. Okay? Alright. Bye. -See you another time. -See you. -Bye. -Hey. Hey. I need a fucking coffee. Yeah. Me too. I had a really long night. So, who was she? I met her on an app. Oh, God! I can never do an app. I'll feel like I need, like, an STD test before sleeping with anyone. Yeah, because you're crazy and paranoid. -True. -Did you STD test Felipe? No, but that's different. I met him through a friend. -Right? -No. -Really? -Not at all. Fuck. So, do you want me to go with you today? Um, you know, they just put a turkey baster up there. Can I get a chai tea latte with almond milk and a little bit of cinnamon? And whatever she's getting. I'll have an Americano with an extra shot. I just feel like you're gonna be in the waiting room for ten minutes. And that's it. So... I'm fine. I promise. Oh, my gosh! You're gonna be a mommy! You see that? That is the sperm being injected into your uterus. Now, I want you to stay positive. But the success rate for a woman your age is around 15%. I don't want you to be disappointed if we have to do it again. Okay. I know it's gonna break out in the American market. That movie is gonna be a festival, darling, trust me. Okay, bye. - Skye. - Yeah. Get in here. What's up? Look at this. My tits look huge! I look like Pamela Anderson. I mean, yeah. They're perky as fuck.

She can't even show up for the intro on time? What does that say about her work ethic? I know, I know. This has never happened before in my life. -Hi. Eva. -Hi. Lorena. -Brian. -A little about me, I am... I'm half Mexican. So, anyway... I'm always, like, switching back and forth, and I feel like I've really grown up in both worlds. And I think in today's age, being Latin and being in the US, it's like there's a whole new world of talent... ...and I wanna be the person who represents them. My friend Arnulfo said that you take very good care of him. Brian has been pushing for a bigger management company, but I don't know. - I have this feeling, you know... - What can I get you? Uh, yeah, I'm gonna have an Americano with an extra shot, and whatever they're having. I want a matcha with coconut milk, please. Iced coffee with oat milk, thank you. Actually, no, I'm sorry. Um... I can't do... Okay. Uh, cappuccino. Can you check how many milligrams of caffeine? You know what? Actually, if you're already gonna find out, can you also look up green tea and a latte? How many milligrams of caffeine per serving? And then get back to me, and I'll decide. I'll, uh... I'll try to figure that out. I'll be back. - Okay... - Oh! Actually, you know what? Can you come back? Sorry. You know, just scratch that and, um, let's just do a decaf cappuccino. Okay, so I was saying... Mmm-hmm. Si. I'm great. It's just... It's really hot in here, right? You guys really hot? No, it's pretty chilly in here. I'm a little off my game. Are you sick? - She has a shoot next week. - I feel great. I feel great. So, we were talking about the, uh... Why L-Latinos are really... Are you going to throw up? No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we should go. I-It was great meeting you. Um... we'll stay in touch. - Yeah. - No, I'm... I feel great. If you think I'm gonna miss any of this, you're out of your mind. Just tell the camera where we're going. I'm going to an ultrasound where hopefully, we'll hear the heartbeat of my baby. She means our baby. And you're going to want someone there to film it. -Put the phone down. -What? Come on. I'm gonna document everything, so just get used to it. No, really, I think you should put the phone down. -Put it down. -Okay. Alright. Are you ready? I think I should go on my own this time. What if it's like last time? Look, don't worry. This is nothing like last time. This time is completely different. How do you know for sure? I just know. I promise. Now, let's go see our baby. -My baby. My uterus, my baby. -Our baby. I'm the baby momma. -How many times do I have to tell you? -My baby inside of my body. My baby. - Mmm-hmm. - You okay? Okay. Try not to move. Sorry. I'm emotional. Okay, if you want me to record it, try not to move for a moment. Okay. Yeah! Confirmed! Confirmed! Okay? You happy? Okay. I'm really happy. So, everything is looking great. Um, however, we did find a small amount of fluid on the right side of your uterus. -Fluid? -It's just blood. Should be fine. Should we be concerned? Most of the time, it just gets re-absorbed into the body. Um, it can cause some spotting and on very rare occasions, a miscarriage. A miscarriage? Uh, I'm sorry. I'm gonna need an exact percentage of what are the chances that something can go wrong. Because, as you know, I've had a miscarriage before, so I just... I can't take any chances. I-I need to be really informed and prepare for whatever's happening next. 'Cause I don't want any surprises this time around. You will never be completely informed and prepared again. You're about to be a mom. Just try not to worry. Hope for the best. So, how did you two meet? - Oh, no. We're not... - Yeah, no. She's not my girlfriend. We met in college. We're roommates. But we live together. And then I'm having a baby, she's helping me with it. It's complicated. - What? - You said it! -What? -You said it. You said I'm helping you with the baby. Well, I'm personally glad she's got a friend to help her. She's gonna need all the help she can get with the baby. I keep telling her that. I don't understand why everyone keeps saying that. It's like I can have a baby on my own. I run my own business, okay? I'm-I'm an independent woman. I do everything on my own. Why can't I have a fucking baby on my own? Skye, my dad's coming at 1:00 so please get out of here. And hide your weed shit. So, couldn't you just freeze your eggs and wait a little? I already did that two years ago. I don't wanna wait any longer. But you worked so hard on your management company. Why would you just throw that away? Mom, I'm gonna hire two more managers in the next six months. Okay? I got this figured out. Oh, really? You've got single-motherhood figured out. Please enlighten me. Okay. First of all, I saw a study in Europe, okay, that talked about SMC, Single Mother of Choice, and two-parent households. And it turns out, that the children came out just the same in both. So, you're quoting Google now? Why do you want this so badly and why now? Because... Do you remember Ryan? I was pregnant. -And... it didn't work out. -What? So, anyway, the point is I... I can't keep my mind off of it since then. I... I really want a baby. I knew there was more to that breakup than you were letting on. Do you wanna talk about it? Let's talk about it. I just said I don't wanna talk about it! I'm sorry that happened, Eva, but... you know, life is full of disappointments, and having a child is not gonna change that. Okay, look. If you don't wanna support me in this journey, that's fine. Okay? I don't need your support. Actually, I don't need anyone's help, okay? Were you gonna tell your dad about it And what about abuelita? Abuelita would never understand this. And Dad... Dad was supposed to be here 10 minutes ago. I was... gonna tell him in person if he shows up. He's no good with this stuff. What? What? Keeping his word? Yeah, I know. And I still managed to... make plans with him like... Fucking idiot. How come he gets a special meal and I get a FaceTime call while you're peeing in front of me. You get the "pee call." I get the pee call. Thank you so much. -How many weeks are you? -Fourteen. You have to be extra careful right now. You have to wash your hands all the time. It's a weird virus... It's in China and I'm OCD as it is. I'm fine. I know. That's stupid. Okay. It's okay. Okay. Focus. Papa? Well, I mean, you're in Vegas. It's only a five hour drive. I could... I don't know. Maybe, I could drive over to you, or you could come here if, you know... Let's just reschedule, okay? Was there anything you wanted to tell me? No. No, everything's fine. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. I don't know why you still expect anything from him. You know what he's like. - And by the way... - Mmm-hmm. Please don't hate me. No! You said that we were gonna stay in and watch a movie together. I know, but... I know you remember Crys. -The girl I've been dating. -Mmm-hmm. It's her best friend's birthday and she invited me to the party. You know, things are getting serious between us, so it's kind of a big deal. I'm not going. Oh, my God. Please come with me. Seriously. We made a plan. We said that tonight we were going to stay together and we're gonna a watch movie, and I was really looking forward to it. We don't always have to stick to the plan. You know you can be spontaneous, right? But I like sticking to the plan. I don't want to just get dressed and go out and meet people I don't know. It doesn't sound fun to me. Eva, I really like this girl, and I just want to know how you feel about her. So can you please get dressed and come out with me? Fine, I'll just go by myself. This corona thing is killing us. No, just old people so far. But seriously, you're pregnant. You need to stay home more than anyone. Can someone get you supplies? Hi! -Hi, there. I miss you. -I miss you. Are you... Let me see your belly. I feel like I still don't look like totally pregnant. But then I look kind of like I just ate too much or something. Oh, my gosh. You have a little bump. -Do you see it? -Yes. Yeah, a little bump, right? It's so cute. Thank you. I'm excited. How's your trip? Oh, my God. Crystal's family is amazing. I could absolutely live here. I love it. By the way, did you get the envelope yet about the gender reveal? Because I cannot wait to find out if it's a boy or girl together. I did. I think it's a boy, because I'm witchy like that. Okay. All right. I'll take your bet, we'll see what happens. Yeah, I put the envelope aside, like you asked, even though it's killing me. Just so you know. So, actually, one of the reasons I'm calling is because I think you guys should actually come home earlier. I've been reading the news a lot, and I just feel like this thing is getting really out of control, and I just don't know what that means for you and... Well, I think it'll be fine. I mean, there's really no cases of it here. Everyone's just freaking out because of the news. You just gotta stay calm. Just stay inside, wash your hands, stay six feet away from people, and you'll be fine. But they're saying that it could get really bad. And I'm definitely going to go do a grocery shop right now. I feel like we just need to have some things in the house. I don't know. I think it can be more serious than what you think. Well, you do realize that the news is made to put fear in you, right? So maybe you should take a break from it for a while. Okay, well... But you should read it. Are you going to read it? Fine, we'll catch up when I have time. But right now, I am going to enjoy a margarita. So I have to go. Okay, all right. But I'll call you. We'll talk soon, right? -Yes, of course. -All right. I love you. Take care of our baby. I will. Love you. One of the many unknowns about COVID-19 is "What are the risks to pregnant women?" Are they more vulnerable to getting the virus? If infected, are they more likely to experience severe symptoms? And is there a threat of transmission to the fetus? It's Arnulfo. Let me in. I'm not seeing anyone. I'm not anyone. Buzz me up. I'm coming down. You should be taking this seriously. What are you doing here? I am taking it seriously. This is a huge opportunity for us. What are you talking about? All productions have shut down. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. -Let me in. -I'm not letting you in. Eva, you of all people should know that I've been wanting to direct this movie for the past seven years. Nobody's working. Everyone's available right now. This draft, it's gonna blow your mind, I promise. Don't tell me you're one of those people. It's not a big deal unless you're old or you have asthma or some weird immunity shit. I'm pregnant. Now you have to let me in so I can give you a hug. -Come on. -No. Who's the dad? Wait. I didn't know you had friends, let alone a boyfriend... A fiance? Yeah, I got a sperm donor. And I... I have friends. I have... a friend. I just, you know... That is actually very on brand. You're reading it, yeah? We just need to get a few people involved so we can get things rolling and I can get the financing. Drop the script. Walk away. And I'm gonna disinfect that because you're not following the rules. All this thing you're doing, I love it. It's hilarious. Okay, I love you. Read it. Take care of the baby. - Don't hang out with your grandma. - Call me today. I love you. Shouldn't you be at the airport already? Not getting on the plane right now. So... I mean, you're just not gonna come home? Well, my girlfriend owns a place here. and I figure it'd be easier and safer and cheaper. And I just want to weather the storm in Florida. What the fuck? I know. You were right. Everything just started escalating so quickly. Do you still have the envelope? Yeah. Do you want to open it together? Who knew we were gonna find out the gender of my baby during a fucking zombie apocalypse. What does it say? It's a little boy. Oh, my God! I knew it. Can we come in? Oh, I prefer not, actually. Sorry. We both have masks on. Oh, yeah. I'm pregnant. Okay. Sorry. Oh. - Okay then. We'll just wait. -Okay. Hey, Eva, how are you holding up? Well, it's strange times, for sure. But, you know, I always figured I'd do this on my own. There's a few things that are changing, actually, by the day. So I just wanted to call and just give you a bunch of updates, all at the same time. -Okay. -Um... Unnecessary ultrasound appointments are just being canceled. You'll still have your anatomy scan because that one's very important. But for the appointment, you'll need to wear a mask and gloves, and you will be checked outside, your temperature. It goes without saying, you have to go to the appointment completely on your own, okay? -Well, I wasn't planning on having anyone anyway. -Great. The other thing is... delivery. I've talked to the hospital, and it seems they are requiring women to deliver with an N95 mask on. You cannot have anyone in the room with you. But if you do wish to get a doula, which I highly recommend, they can be on FaceTime with you during the delivery. A doula? Why would you recommend that? Well, studies have shown that it lowers your chances of having a C-section by 50%. Having a support system during the birthing process is actually very helpful to both mother and baby. Okay, um... Is there anything else that I should be doing right now to be better prepared for... Um... taking a hypnobirthing or a Lamaze class? That would be really helpful. And you probably would be able to do that online, which is a good idea at this point. Also, I'm not sure if you were having a baby shower... My mom said that she would, maybe, throw me one, but I don't know. Let's talk to your mom, friends and just find out the products that they like because I'm hearing there are massive delays on deliveries, since you we won't be able to go to the stores. I don't have any... Well, my friends... No one's a mom. Do you need me to send you some lists? I mean, I've done a bunch of research. I have lists, but... Well... Yeah, I'll take a list. Of course. No problem. I will send that to your e-mail. And, um... Things are so crazy right now, e-mail's probably the best way to get in touch with me for the time being. -Okay? -Mmm-hmm. Great. So we will talk again soon. -Okay. -Okay. Great. Bye. Wait, so are you firing me? At least you can file for unemployment, okay? I'm technically self-employed and this SBA website is a fucking nightmare. I don't even know if I qualify. There's no money coming in, okay? I can barely afford my own rent, let alone the office rent. Well, I can't pay my rent either now. I don't... I don't know what else to do. I was already thinking about moving to Mexico. Now there's nothing holding me back. Maybe this is a sign. Is there anything I can help you with before I start packing and planning my leaving? Is anybody helping you? I got it figured out. You're a hard-ass. But I have enjoyed working for you so much. I will. I will keep you posted. I'll hold the door for you, if you like. I'll wait for the next one. Thanks. Hi! Guys, my name is Shaylyn. I'm gonna be your guide and your leader during these four three hour hypnobirthing classes. So let's start by everybody saying their name, so that I can get to know you. Your partner's name and if this is your first child. Your due date and then maybe an interesting tidbit about you. -Hi, everyone, I'm Kate. And this is Jim. This is my first. Can you say "hi?" Say, "hi, everybody." Sorry, we had to give him some screen time so that we could get this done. Hello, I'm Becks. -This is Rob. -Hi. We don't know if it's a boy or a girl. -We're just gonna be surprised. -Oh, yeah. Is it going speak in an Australian accent? -I mean, I hope so. We're a bit strange. -Maybe. All right, who's next? Um, hi. I'm Eva and I don't have a partner. I actually... This was through sperm donation. I see there's another single mom, actually. Aw, hi, Eva. I'm not single. I have, actually, my husband. Christian, baby. -He's... -Oh, is it time to start? He's actually in the front line, taking care of all of us, you guys. I love you, babe. That's why he couldn't be here with me, but... Well, he's there. So, Eva, you're a single mother by choice? I just wanted to circle back. - Yeah. - Okay. No, that's very brave. It's gonna be the best decision you ever made with the most wonderful gift you're giving yourself. You will also never have any free or quiet time for the rest of your life. Hi. Hi. Oh, how are deliveries going? Fine. Well, uh, do you feel like you're safe at least, you know? It is what it is. How many have you had today? I'm double-parked, so I gotta go. Have a good day, though. Okay, um... Hi. How are you? Uh, when is your due date again? Remind me. Uh, August 29th. Uh, I'm sorry. Are you a little young to be a doula? I'm more of just an energetic support. Not the lady that sews up your vagina afterwards, so... Okay. Yeah, Well, that's good to know. 'Cause I... definitely want that person to have gone to medical school. -No offense. -None taken. - Okay. - Yeah. So would I. I'm not totally sure like what, what you guys do, but it seems like it could be really beneficial. We are very well educated on what is going on in your body throughout your pregnancy as well as your birthing process. If you become exceptionally filled with fear or anxiety, you can basically go into a state of panic, and the body responds the same way. And so then you've got this clenched body and that's a lot more difficult. to let a baby out of. So is it kind of like... I guess what a husband would do if I... I had one. To be honest, the, the spouses are usually freaking out a little bit themselves. I mean, this does sound... It sounds really nice. Um... The world is obviously in a strange place, and um, there's a lot of stuff I'm trying to figure out financially. But, um, but could you maybe send me a rate sheet or something like that? Do we really need the masks? - I promise I'll stay on my towel. - -Okay, but back up. Okay. Lift your shirt up. I wanna see your belly. Oh, you're huge, huh? I'm not huge. Huge is a terrible word. Don't you remember being pregnant at all? I was always tiny. I gained, like, 15 pounds the whole pregnancy. Well, that's not even healthy. I am perfectly normal weight. I'm not insulting you. I just think it's fun. You have a big belly. Okay, enough with the belly. -You look great. -Thanks. So how you doing with all this? It is such strange times. Yeah, it is. I've been doing a lot of budgeting, a lot of accounting. Listen, Eva, I wanted to talk to you about the baby shower. So I was thinking between your girlfriends, and then our family and our distant family, I think we could actually just get everything on the registry, which would be amazing. You really think it's appropriate to ask people to buy you things at a time like this? I will get you the crib. Mom, I was counting on this baby shower. Since when did you count on anyone? Since I'm not making any money and I'm putting everything on my credit card, You should ask your dad. Yeah, right. But maybe this is actually a chance for him to step up and be a parent. You know? He doesn't even know I'm pregnant. I thought you guys had the big dinner. He is such a dick! I don't even want to talk about it. Look, honestly... that's why I don't count on anyone. Everyone's a huge disappointment. Eva, don't be like that. We're going to figure this out. No we're not. I'm gonna figure it out like I always do. Hi. Hey. So okay, I got upstairs. It's really intense. They like checked my temperature and everything before they let me in. But look. Oh, perfect, you're already in an exam room. Mmm-hmm. Yeah so, anyway I'm really excited that you're here on the call with me. Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person. No, actually, they're not letting anyone in. So I guess, it doesn't matter They have this, like, whole thing set up for like, partners, support system, like, husbands... to see the ultrasound at the same time. So I'm gonna prop you up, and then you're going to be able to see the screen with me. Um, of the baby okay? Okay. I can't wait to see our baby. My baby. I'm propping you up. Hey, Eva, it's Dr Levy. I got a chance to look at those scans. Uh, everything's looking great, but we will actually need to have you come in for the next anatomy scan, even though we're skipping most of the unnecessary ultrasounds. You have something called velamentous cord insertion. Shouldn't be a big deal. I just want to get it checked out. Great, thanks. Hi. Eva, how are you? Lauren. Hi. Sorry. Um, I just was told that I have this thing called velamentous cord insertion. And no one's picking up, the doctor's not picking up, my mom's not picking up. And don't know if you've heard of this but I'm freaking out. I just looked it up online and then there's so many horrible things in there. I don't know what to do. I'm having a panic attack right now. What? It's okay. First things first, put your hand on your belly and take a deep breath Okay, okay. Say hello to the baby. -Is the baby okay? Is the baby okay? -You're okay. Yes, okay, yes, yes, let it out. Let it out. You're okay, I promise. I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know right now. I just want you to breathe, okay? Now, the biggest question we're gonna ask your doctor is where the cord is. Okay, let me write this down. It can be closer to the fundus. - Okay. - or the cervix. So the fundus is much better. But regardless, most people come out of this with a perfectly healthy baby. Things online are so horrible. I know, online it paints a different picture, because there's all these stories of horrible tragedies, and it can create all this fear. But we're here for you, I promise. I really hope. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Overnight, growing outrage over the death of a black man who died in police custody. Police used tear gas to push back the crowds when thousands of protesters took to the streets, blocking intersections and chanting, "I can't breathe" demanding justice for the death of George Floyd. Hand's up! Don't shoot! Hand's up! Don't shoot! The 46-year-old was seen on the ground in handcuffs, with a police officer's knee on his neck. His nose is bleeding. A video camera captured the final moments of George Floyd's life. About five minutes into the video, Floyd appears to lose consciousness, EMTs arrive and check for pulse, while the officer's knee remains on his neck. Floyd is later taken to the hospital where he's pronounced dead. We are following several protests that are happening across Southern California. Look at this one in West Hollywood. It's probably the largest one right now, where protesters stopped traffic and held a moment of silence, many of them lying down in the middle of the intersection at La Cienega and Santa Monica. Then they marched to the police precinct on San Vicente where they have been stationed for the past few hours. Hey. So I'm pulling up to a protest right now. Have you been going? Eva, why are you at a protest? I went to one the other day and it was so hectic. Trust me, you don't need to be there. I got tear-gassed. I just, I really wanted to do something, but that's, that's very scary. And there's a million things you can do to contribute right now. But putting you and your baby at risk really isn't worth it. All right. You're totally right. There's so many people out there right now, I'm like... It's still a pandemic. Okay. No, you're right. I'm... I'm gonna go home. I'm just gonna go home. All right, I love you. Love you too. Hey. You look like shit. Are you okay? I look like Covid that's all. Como, you got the coronavirus? Are you serious? What... What are you feeling? It's like... like a horrible flu. And it also hurts to breathe. Oh, so that's, that's very kind. You're gonna give me the speech? No. no, no, no, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry you got it. I'm actually calling because... It's really strong, like at the end, I really believe that he's gonna, like, live this whole new life, you know? And it's, it's hopeful. You're a tough nut to crack. So if you got emotional, then it's probably genius. I started making a list of producers and actors that we can reach out to and I feel like we can start packaging this thing, at least, and then you know, we'll take it one day at a time. Honestly, Eva, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I think I might just stay in Mexico. What do you mean like... permanently? It can get really lonely. I know. And how are you? How's work? How's the rest of your clients? It's been different. And, um... had to let go of my office. Had to let go of my assistant. Lot of my clients went back home. I don't know who's uh, coming back. You know I, I have a friend, Christy Romano. You know, she's awesome. She's funny. Oh, I know Christy Romano, I mean, she's not Latin but I think I'd actually make an exception because she's so cool. I'd love an introduction. I would love to manage her. No well I, I was, gonna say that she, uh, she needs a part-time assistant. So, you know, maybe if you're... if you're getting squeezed for money, I figured... No, I just thought you could, you could use the extra cash right now. Maybe... I hope you know this doesn't change anything. I'm still gonna be here for you and the baby. You keep saying that. I never fucking asked you to be here for me and the baby. And the truth is that you've just been gone this entire time. Well, I'm not gonna apologize for not paying rent on a place I'm not even living at. Okay, I'm not asking you to apologize, but, like, what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to find a roommate during Covid right now? All I know is that the movers are coming to get my stuff today. They're going to put it all in storage. If you need anything, just call me. Oh, great. Yeah, that'll be great. I'll just call. What are you gonna do if I call you? Huh? You can't do anything. You're not here. You know what, Skye? I'm gonna be so busy just dealing with my bills and finding a new roommate during Covid, I don't think I'm gonna have time to call you. Okay? Bye. I don't drink, I don't smoke. And I've been in lock down ever since this whole thing started. Here's my hand sanitizer. I'm available to move in right away. Uh, you said it was $1,200 a month, right? I know you said $1200, but I only got $700. So, uh, can you do that? You know, I like to keep to myself really. But I can pay, uh, first and last month's rent upfront. And what did you say, you do for work again? Wait one sec, sorry. How much weed do you smoke? Honestly, shit ton. You sound really perfect. What about you? What's... Uh, well, I'm... I'm pregnant. What? Oh, I'm pregnant. Seven months pregnant. No, no, that's not, that's not gonna work, sorry. Arny has said so many great things about you. - Oh! - So, I'm really excited to uh, be talking to you right now. Hold on one, hold on one second Honey no, just, she's ready to go down. Yeah, she had, she had her lunch. Sorry. Yeah, she, um... mom life. Assistant's position part-time is like, 20 hours a week. -Okay. -For starters, you know, and then, uh, you can, uh, you can do it all from the safety of your home and in front of your computer, so... Oh, that's... God, that sounds so great right now. Yeah, I love that. Great. Okay, so then I would... I would need you to work on my social stuff. Okay. Uh, and then I have a lot of projects in development. They need to be um, sort of like, organized and proofread, and then, um, I need decks. This is all stuff that I'm like a pro at. I actually have a management company, so I've been doing this for a really long time. Wow. Really? Do you manage Arny? Yeah, I do, Actually. He's my client. Well... he, he was. Well, I guess I... I guess, technically, I had a management company. I don't know, it's... Times have been really tough lately, so... Yeah, yeah. They have been really, really crazy. Uh, oh, honey, are you pregnant? Oh, um, no. I mean, yeah. I am, but that's not... I'm a machine. I've been going crazy not working during quarantine. -So this will interfere... -No, no, no no, stop, stop! Don't, don't, don't do that. This is a good thing. It's amazing. Congratulations. Oh, thanks. Oh my God. You're gonna get so huge. In my case, I just blew up. Oh, wow. My ankles, man, they doubled in size. -So, -I'm sorry. No, no worries. So but this doesn't affect me getting the job at all? Oh, my gosh, No. Are you kidding me? Women need to support women, especially pregnant women. You're like creating life inside your little body right now. I would... I would... I would love this job. I'm, yeah, I'm available. I'm ready. I would love to work for you. And sorry. Just last question. So uh, what was the rate again? I didn't catch that. Um, it's $17 an hour. Babe, she's... No, I don't know if she's gone potty. What're you talk... Okay, I have to go. But, um, I'm excited if you're down. Yeah, yeah. No, that works. That totally works. Okay, I'm gonna send you an email with like a whole bunch of documents. And you can get going on that stuff, and, uh, I'll talk to you soon. Great. Thank you. Bye. Shit! The deck is done. And then I also took all the development scripts and I color-coded them, and I actually alphabetized them. Wow! You are a beast, Eva. Thank you. So how are you? Oh, um... I'm good. I'm good. -Yeah? -No, I'm not good. Um, my nanny quit and um... I've been home-schooling. Moms, like, deserve an award. Seriously. Like, I don't know how we just like we get up, and we just do everything. All things, like, you don't know yet. You don't know yet, but you will. Soon. - Yeah -And um... Like, ugh, I was so mean to my mom. -Were you mean to your mom? -Yeah. And now I'm looking back, and I'm like, she was just surviving! So glad I have my husband. Oh, I didn't mean it. Well, you know, I mean, you're gonna be fine. Oh no, no, no. Don't worry about that. Please, no I'm... You've got this. You're fine. I'm... Yeah, I want... I want to do this on my own. I, uh... My mom did on her own, too. I mean, I had a dad, but, you know... -Not really. So... -Hmm... Anyway, um, let me know if you need anything else. Wait a sec. Hold on. Um... Would you please just tell her to quit? Right. Anyway, is there anything else that you want me to do for you? Why is she screaming? What did you do? You're torturing her? Let me know what else you need, okay? Eva, can you just get the meeting with Raymond for next week, okay? I gotta go. Eva, honey? Yeah, yeah, I got it. I wrote that down. Hey, stay safe and wash your hands. Okay, I will. Thanks. Bye. -Hey! -Hey! I'm sorry about last time. I was... super hormonal. It's all good. I understand. Did you find a roommate? No, no! There were some real weirdos from the market for roommates. Uh, but my dad actually pulled through. -Wow! -Yeah. I know. I never expected it. How's the baby doing? Good. It's kicking a lot. How's Crystal? How's... What is... What does she even do for work? I never even asked. Oh, um, Crystal's an architect, but she's good. We're both doing good. We're hanging in there together. I feel like I didn't get to spend time with you guys. I wish I would have gotten to know her better. You're always working, always busy. You know I get it. I know, but when I was talking to my dad, I realized... I'm more like him than I want to be. Um, you're not that bad. I don't know. I want to see this baby soon so we're going to have to figure it out. I know. I know... I don't know... Well, we'll figure it out. Yeah, we will. -Hey. -Hey. So, um, last time I was here, it was pretty harsh. I guess I just feel like I had to be responsible for the two of us for so many years because you were, you know, like... All over the place and, um... I guess I resented you for it. It's not easy to raise a kid. It's not going to be easy to get it right. You're not so sure of yourself anymore? You did the best you could. You know, I always thought that one day... I would be a grown up... and I would have all the answers. And then you realize that that day never comes. We're all just people trying to figure it out. I know I wasn't perfect... but I love you. I know. I don't wanna to do this all on my own. Eva, you were never gonna do this alone. I'm gonna be a grandma. I'm gonna be a grandma. I wish I could hug you right now. I wish you could too. Oi! Ugh! Shit! Hi! Hey, good to see you again on FaceTime. Tell me about the script you sent my client. Right. Um, so Arnulfo wrote it with her in mind. And we think she'd be perfect for the lead. Is there a start date? No, not yet, um... So there's no start date, no funding. And you want her to attach herself to your client's movie? Well, everyone who has a start date doesn't really have a start date right now. And we know she loves the script, right? Yeah, she does. But, I mean, that's not enough for her to attach herself because she's extremely busy. She has three projects that she... What's going on with you? Are you okay? Are you okay? You listening? -Hello? -Yeah. Um, yeah! I think we should all just jump on a Zoom call... Right. This again. Okay, I got to get going. I've seen and heard enough. I'll talk to you later. Um... Wait. No, I'm pregnant. I think I'm having contractions. You're pregnant? Yeah. Is that why you were throwing up after we met? -What? -I thought you had COVID. No, no. That was morning sickness. You gotta take it easy. Okay? Take it easy. And... Are you having another contraction? Yeah, I think I'm... I think I'm gonna call my doula right now. -Yeah. -Okay, good... - Hey, congratulations! - Oh, thanks! -I have three kids. You're gonna have a blast. -Thanks. -Boy or girl? -Oh, boy. Okay, talk soon. Bye. I'll be seeing you. Bye! Hi, this is Lauren. I am with a client off-grid for the next couple of days. If this is an emergency or you are in labor, please call Dana at 323-333-6533. She is aware of all my clients, is a certified doula and is ready to jump in in a moment's notice. Eva? I'm Dana. I'm Lauren's replacement. How you doing? I've had five contractions since the last message that I sent you. Having another one? -Yeah. -Okay, just find that breath. Good. Send it deep into your body. - Keep it up. Find that breath. Just breath. Eva, changing position could make it a little more intense. Good. Breathe, breathe, breathe. You're doing great. - I'm definitely ready for an epidural. - -Yeah! Nice and slow. Let's not rush to the car. Okay. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. My pleasure. - You got the door? - Yeah. Are you feeling pain or just uncomfortable, like the shaking and stuff? - Um... - -You'll need to check her. But the contractions... I'm starting to feel. You're starting to feel it? You want to press your button again? Yeah, but I already pressed it twice. You did? Again, you pressed it? Okay. Let me see if we can give you a little more. But it won't affect his heart, right? Right, let's try and get you on your back first so we can place the epidural bag. The baby's heart rate drops like, an unusual amount, and... They're a little worried that there's a cord somewhere. We're trying to figure out how to... do this as easily as possible without affecting his heart. Yeah, it's so hard. I'm so sorry. Cord compression can be a very real thing. -It's a very... It can be dangerous. -I did everything right. We went into natural labor and everything. Eva, we've been turning you every 20 minutes for the last six hours to try to shift the baby's position. Nothing is working. We're going to have to do an emergency C section. Hi! Hi. Ooh! Ooh! Every single piece of this entire pregnancy... it was absolutely worth it because you are perfect. You're what I've waited for my whole life.
