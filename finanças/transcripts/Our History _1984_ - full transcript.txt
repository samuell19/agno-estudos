Robert Avranche, a man alone on a train. What'll happen to him? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Trouble, perhaps. -What is it? -I want to tell you a story. -What kind? -May I sit? The story begins on a train. A good-looking guy's sitting alone in first class. He seems depressed, as if he wanted to jump out of the window. -Okay so far? -Sure. The train stops at a station. The guy, let's call him… Robert Avranche. He gets off the train to stretch his legs. He walks along the platform. Then he buys a beer. He really loves beer. His third since the trip began. He's a drinker. He pays for his beer and guzzles down half of it on the platform. -Okay so far? -Great. Sitting on a bench nearby is a woman. She hangs around stations watching trains and passengers who step out for beer. So she's watching the guy with his bottle. He's good-looking, yet sort of odd. He doesn't want to get back on. It's as if he wants to run away. But he doesn't, surely because he doesn't have the guts. So he goes back to his compartment. The woman stands up. Here's where the action starts. She boards the train. Why? To sleep with the guy. What do you think? Interesting story? -It's what I expected. -Me too. I like short stories that occur between two stations and that last an hour. No risk. I'm not the clingy type. What if I wanted to be? It's just a quickie. No flowers. -Well? -Okay. Don't follow me! The story's over. -I'd like to know the rest. -It's over! It ended in a wad of Kleenex. The story continues in a station hotel. Just my luck! What more do you want? A smile. I haven't smiled in ages. Wait! I'll get more beer. Miss! I don't even know her damn name! Give it to me. So what are we doing here? Talking. First I'll drink, then we'll talk. I haven't talked in ages. Now's my chance. And if I'm bored? I've been bored for years. I'm enjoying this. So will you. Believe it or not, I'm a funny guy. And I'll make you laugh. The scene? A station hotel room. I love hotel rooms. Why do people insist on buying luxury apartments when hotel rooms fit the bill? Listen, if it were up to me, I'd stay right here, watching the trains go by. I like trains too. I've spent my whole life working with cars, yet I like trains! Trains spark your imagination, you meet people, and you get laid at times. You can screw in a car, an elevator, a doorway, anywhere! Even in bed. Let me finish. It won't take long. It's about a couple in a hotel room. They're a little tired. She's naked in bed. He's on a chair, still dressed. He's drinking beer. She's bored silly. They're like an old couple. But they're not. Far from it! They're a young couple, and they'll go far. They can look forward to tears, to making up, the works! I'll tell you more. One day, you'll even smile. I swear. Then I'll be happy. You're a witch with the face of an angel. Keep talking. I'm falling asleep. Fine. He's Robert Avranche. He owns a garage outside of Paris. He's returning from Geneva. ‪The airport was fogged in, ‪so he took a train. It was his lucky day. Customs didn't even open his suitcase. They're usually much more vigilant. What was in his suitcase with the false bottom? His savings from the garage, about 500,000 francs! Isn't my story fascinating? It's crappy. You take advantage of a poor girl just because she wants sex. Not her fault! She'd rather do something else. He flashes his cash at her like she's a beggar. The money was better off in Switzerland! -I brought it just for you. -You don't even know my name! -What is it? -I'm a girl you forget about. I'm not leaving! The guy is picked up by a girl. But he hangs on to her. Funny, huh? "The Nympho and the Boozer." Love at first sight on a train. Starts on a train and continues in a hotel room. We rent a car and drive to a little house with a fridge full of beer. Sit down. I've got important news for you. The house is fine, the kind I've always dreamed of. This'll be my chair. You'll sit on the couch. I'll look at you and drink beer. Food's not a problem. Sundays, you'll make pasta. Weekdays, hamburgers or grilled sardines. I'm not fussy. As for the rest, meaning our relationship, there'll be no problems either. Split when you want, screw any guy you like, come back looking like death warmed over… No problem at all. Just help me screw up my life. And smile every once in a while. Madonna-like. What about the dough? That's not a problem! I put this case on the table and open it. You can help yourself. Is that okay? Fine! Let's start now! I'm going dancing. Robert Avranche… He's got it made! -So long, gorgeous. -Night, sweetie. Farewell, darling. -Come have a drink. -What? -How about a drink? -A drink? Donatienne's inviting us in for a drink. -We're already tipsy. -What kind of drink? Don't leave. I'm not sleepy. -Neither am I. -You never are. Are you sleepy? Then come on. Since she's adamant, we should go in. I'm stay in the car. Bring me my drink. Maybe you ought to back up in front of the house. Sure, just watch me back up! How's that for backing up? -Whose car? -No idea. -Another pick-up? -I didn't pick anyone up. She's up to her old tricks. No one asked you in. It's my bedroom and my bed. I hope this guy's sexier than the last. You picked up another guy? I wouldn't have to, if you'd give me a chance. We saw him. -A new guy in her bed. -That's nothing new. Yeah, but this guy's weird. -How so? -He's just weird. He's not weird. Just drunk, that's all. Aren't you, pal? -You met him on a train too? -I don't remember. How pathetic! Nice guys won't fall for you. What's wrong, dear? Too much champagne? Get that lowlife out of my bed. He scares me. He's crazy about me, so I'm scared. You can't stay here, buddy. She needs her privacy. Get it? Go on, get dressed. Get dressed and come with me. I'm fed up sitting out there, so I'm going home. Duval. Take me with you. Don't start that again, okay? Duval. Pretend I've already left. Please. Don't stand there sulking. Go to bed. Duval! Watch out, here comes a performance. I'm tired of screwing around. I want to start over. Take me with you. Give me the stability I need. I really like you, Donatienne. We all do. You're very sweet, so don't change. Stay just the way you are. Watch your step! She's not interested. Don't push it. -What'll we do with him? -She'll take him home. -To her attic? -Yes. No, not in your car. You're in no condition to drive. It's the story of a girl who's fed up with being a maid. She needs a change and she wants to meet an older man who'll take her to Paris and make her a lady. But the man is tired. He hasn't slept for two days. He can't keep track of 14 stories. He has to stick to one. It's about a man who comes back! They try to dump him, treat him like a dog, but he won't quit! They can't shake him. He always finds his way home! Should I have stayed away? Shall l tell you why I came back? I bought a Polaroid. Guess why. I want a pic of your smile. Great idea, huh? You're bound to smile again. Maybe not tomorrow or today, but someday. And I'll be there with my camera. Why are you so sad? You can tell me. I'm an expert on depression. What's wrong? Look at this. Ever seen such a sad girl in all your life? They took my kids away from me. What? They took my kids away from me. -You've got kids? -Yes. I'm 33, divorced and l live alone in a small house that used to be filled with children's laughter and joy. All that's left now are empty bunk beds and a drunk who's trying to horn in on my depression. -I drink because I'm choked up. -So am I and I can't smile. I'd like you to leave now. Please. -Why? -You bother me. -I want to be alone in my house. -I can't leave you now. You don't understand how upset I am! So what? Just go away! I can't! Sorry to hear about your kids. I can't leave now. Garage owners are softies. Doesn't take much to set us off. I wish you would set off. Get in your car and drive! First, second, third gear! You get to Paris and Donatienne is happy! Because she's fed up! Avranche is fed up too. -With what? -Life. What's wrong with it? Isn't life great? Aren't we cozy in our little attic, while the kids are in school? Ever porked a housewife in the afternoon? On a rainy day? They're more than willing. Feel me up. You'll see. Why'd you bring me up here? How will I get down? Take my hand. Is it about a man who takes a woman's hand? About a man who's loved her for a very long time. Forever, perhaps. Trouble is, he's never met her. He knew she existed. He'd looked for her. But he had never found her. Then, one day, on a train, just when he'd lost hope, he opened his eyes and there she was! He knew she was the one! Your train story gave me an idea. I should head to the station. What do you say? -Great idea. -I agree. 'Cause if we keep telling each other soppy stories, we'll wind up drowning in tears. It's best I take a walk. -This can't be it. -It's the right address. -Robert, what's going on? -You had us worried, you sap! He looks okay. Easy does it. I've seen cases like this. Robert, can you hear me? It's me, Sam, your brother. Stay put. Do you remember Geneviève? And Dominique? Géraldine? You remember them, don't you? Wait! His eyes moved. This is my chair. It's a great chair. I can see the highway from here. Sometimes I just sit here and watch her leave in the morning. I wait here all day. Till she comes back. He's either infatuated or very ill. Who is this girl? The love of my life. I met her on a train. Her face haunts me. She's desperately sad, but l love her sadness, her house, the rainy afternoons, the trucks rolling by. I've found peace of mind here. Like an old coach in a railway depot. Make sure he keeps talking. We'd like to meet the young woman. Where is she? At work? No, she's walking around. -Where? -At the station. What's she doing there? She hangs around on the platforms, watching the trains. She watches the passengers get off. If a guy appeals to her, she follows him. -Won't I be in the way? -No. Come on! -Your suitcase. -Oh yeah. Hi. I called you, gentlemen. Are his bags packed? -Well… -Well, what? What's your name? -Me? -Yes, you. What's your name? -My name? -He's forgotten his name. Sit down. Give me your suitcase. He's a tad confused. Although he was fast asleep in his berth, he's had quite a night. -How about a bath? -No, don't bother. -A drink? -No, thanks. I'm fine. -A beer, then? -I'm really not thirsty. He's not thirsty! He was sleeping like a baby. He didn't even hear me come in. I could've easily robbed him blind. Who wants to take my picture? -I'm smiling. -Your picture? A picture of my smile, an endangered species. Okay, but we don't have a camera. Yes, we certainly have one! Is she nuts or what? Don't get up. Here, it's a Polaroid. -Just press the button. -Okay. -But your smile is gone. -It may come back. Now where was I? -Ready? -Yes. No drink? Sure? -I'm sure. -You're not thirsty? -No. -He's not thirsty. Anyway, I sat down and watched him. I would've liked to have had a brother like him. He looks like a soldier on leave. Don't you agree? Care to call your family? No, I told 'em I'd be gone three or four days. Who said you were staying that long? They all think I can't live without them. Too bad about the smile. Some other time. It's gone. I'm really sorry. I wanted to leave you a souvenir. Here. Use it for your kids. Robert, be reasonable. Come back with us. Your wife and kids are expecting you. -Take his suitcase. -But that one's mine! Who the hell cares? Stop worrying. But it's my suitcase. In this story, suitcases and things are immaterial. There are passengers who wake up during a dream and realize they're not dreaming. Just go along with the story. I wanna stay here, Donatienne. I like your house. I like your story too, especially when you smiled. I want to stay here. Please? Use me as a minor character. Who makes occasional appearances. I'll stay in the wings. Take him away. He's getting mushy. There's bound to be trouble. Come on, Robert. Let's get going. -Hands off! -Stop it, Robert! Watch out, you guys! I won't let anybody take this chair from me! Or you'll get a kick in the balls. It's my chair. You can screw my wife, but don't sit in my chair! Let's have a minimum of respect! -Robert! -Calm down! Stop him! Screw you! The neighbors are complaining. -Is he a neighbor? -They call him the squealer. Always calling the cops. -Were we too noisy? -My wife and I got scared! -Where's your wife? -At home. She's terrified! Let's go calm her down. -Got any beer? -Of course. What are they up to? Let's go, boys, we've got an invite. This way. It's a shortcut. Wait, we forgot somebody. Aren't you coming too? -I'm not sure I should. -We've got to stick together. My wife will be furious! Come on. Down here. Quickly! Make yourselves at home. Quickly! She seems delighted! Lovely nightgown. From Paris? -Come with me. -Why? You'll see. Help me. Help me. Come on down, ma'am. Help me. -What are you doing? -Don't move! Wow! Bravo! We need to talk. Don't be angry. We're having a good time. We enjoy looking at your ass. I told you I was good for a laugh! -Aren't I funny? -Yes, very funny. Yet she's the only one who's not laughing. -We'd better go. -Not yet. Why? It's his life, you know! How does she look? -Who? -My partner. Bored. Are you sure? She's so languid. Isn't she? She seems to be. -Maybe it's not real languor. -I can feel her wilting! Feel her. She's like toffee. -What about me? -Stay in your corner. First, our main character. We'll take care of you later. How is she? Languid or not? Languid for sure. You must be happy then. Or you'd be tense. She isn't into being pawed by you guys! She's dreaming of Duval. She wants to be in his arms. Come, I'll tell you my story. It's about a maid… -Wanna dance with him? -Who? -Duval. -Don't waste your time. He enjoys seeing me pine away. And when I'm old and gray… Donatienne's unhappy. You never ask her to dance. Is that true? -I don't dance. -Neither do I. But sometimes you have to. Life's too full of obligations. Really? -Go outside to fight. -Shut up! The last time I beat up a garage man, it was over an odometer. He tried to sell me a so-called new car. That jalopy had crossed the Sahara ten times! -That's dishonest. -No kidding. I'm just peddling a dance. No risk in that. Depends. Some dancers aren't roadworthy. They fall apart if you hit the gas. I'm sorry, I tried. -Émile, do something! -Let them blow off steam. Kick him in the guts! And in the face! -Don't egg them on. -We should! Go! Strangle him! Take the table! Break the window! Let go. Stop pissing me off! I can't believe this! -Robert, cut it out! -Shut up! Keep it up, boys! Don't stop now! Come see. Your bookshelves! Such mayhem! Shall we call the cops? No, it's a friendly argument. -Would you like a drink? -Look at your living room. It's my wife's furniture. Can I tag along? Better go patch up your garage man. Screw him! I want you! Don't leave me here! Come! Forget about your buddy. I can't leave him in this mess. What a pain! You'll be with me tonight. Stay. We're having champagne. No, I wanna bed a man! Give me your address. I'll come by later. You shouldn't have said that. Look at her now. -What'd I say? -"Later." Women don't like that. It means you don't wanna date her. It rhymes with "hate her." -I just said I'd see her later! -She wants it now, not later! Unbelievable! You can't score in this dump! We're not exactly dogs! In fact, we're banging! -What do they want? -Come. I'll make you an omelet. You and your damn omelets! I deserve more than a lousy omelet! Granted, it's a completely insane story! But at least it's got a plot. -Where is the lady in the nightie? -In bed. Her living room's a mess, so she went to bed. -She's really upset. -Go comfort her. Least you can do. -Your looks will cheer her up. -Lay off him! He's messed up! We're just asking him a favor as a neighbor. What'd I tell you? She's really shook up. Don't cry, dear. You've got company. I wanna go home. -What'd he say? -He wants to go home. I wanna see my wife and kids. What's wrong with this guy? Listen, you're about to lick one of life's toughest challenges. Breaking loose! Don't give up now! -I'm thirsty. -He needs champagne. No, thanks! I'm not a champagne man! I run a garage. I drink beer! -Go get some beer. -It's all gone. The fridge was full of it! We drank it, of course! If it's all gone, go get some more! -Where? -The highway! At a gas station! Hurry up or I'll wreck the rest of the house! You go. You're still dressed. I'm staying here to keep an eye on my friend. -You look much better. -Yes, I'm much better, thanks. -But now he's upset. -Why? -What's wrong? -He didn't like the performance. I liked it a lot. You came 12 times! With me, you never even moan! -He's no better than me! -I beg to disagree. He needs beer. Can't you see he's dehydrated? Good to see he's in better spirits. I no longer wanna go home. I wanna stay right here. -In my house? -Obviously! In your house, your bed, your wife! I'll give you 300 francs a day. -For bed and board. -What about Donatienne? -Who's she? -The girl in the train. Remember? You met her on a train. It wasn't him. It was me! Who asked you? You're not the garage man! No, but I do take trains and meet girls! Your train story is getting on my nerves. That's ancient history now. Right now, I'm with Madeleine. Don't start that all over again! There are limits to my hospitality! Why don't you go see Donatienne? You two made a lovely couple. She's prettier than my wife. You haven't looked carefully. It's dark now! Just wait until daybreak! She's no model! -Donatienne let me down. -How? I dunno. She let me down. I thought she was fantastic! Tramp of the century. But what do I get? A silly girl, all hearts and flowers. In love with a heel. No tramp at all. Life can be so disappointing. Don't give up hope, pal. Life is unfair, but sometimes you have to wade through shit to find gold. She may not be a gem. I'm no jeweler, but I can assure you that Donatienne Pouget, that's her name, is a 100-karat tramp! Stop trying to cheer me up. You figure it out. There are five guys in this room. Five, right? If you've slept with Donatienne, raise your hand. See? Ask anybody from around here, and you'll get the same answer: 100% affirmative. Doesn't sound like a tramp to me, but like a big-hearted girl. So… You prefer my wife? Yes. What shall l do then? -Leave, what else? -Where can I go? I have nowhere to go! Come to my house. We've got room. -I hate your house! -It's exactly like yours, idiot. Our houses are the same. Same TVs, fridges, and beds. Only the wives change. -Your wife turns me off. -You're not gonna bed her! But I need a woman. I can't sleep alone. -Who can I snuggle up against? -Donatienne. Of course. Not a bad idea. -Who is it? -It's me, Émile. -Émile who? -Emile Pecqueur. Can't you feel my mustache? I'm asleep. What do you want? I came to warn you. -About what? -Lies he's telling about you. -Who? -The garage owner. -He claims you're a nice girl. -Who, me? He said, and I quote, "Donatienne Pouget has taught me what respect means." I'll show him what respect means! It's about a woman who wants her man back! -What man? -The garage owner. She lost a garage owner? We're in the wrong house. What do you mean? This is my house! I'm not that drunk! This is my room, my furniture, my bed! But this doesn't seem to be my wife. Do you recognize me, ma'am? Your face does seem familiar. Please excuse us. There's been a mistake. Unbelievable! Exactly the same decor! The same furniture! So where's my garage man? Who the hell cares about him? This is the story of a guy who can't find his house! It's tragic. That jerk was beginning to grow on me. No genius, sure, but comforting! I liked having a man in the house! -Waiting for me in his chair! -Shut up! You'd better shut your mouth! Or I'll slap some sense into you! -Don't you touch me! -Take that! -Where are you going? -Robert's having a housewarming. -Robert who? -Avranche! Seems he's a first-class stud! Did a cyclone hit this place? Do you know whose house this is? Champagne, Mr. Pecqueur? I want to talk to Mr. Avranche! Did you hear the one about the fireman's wife? No. I'll tell it to you. Is that Robert Avranche? She was a pretty brunette with a slight mustache. One day, she finds herself alone in the house. It's August. The shutters are closed. There's a searing heat outside. She sits down, and the chair burns up! "Hell! Is my ass that hot? Fireman's wife with a hot ass!" So she sits down on another chair… I mustn't tell dirty jokes. Go on, sweetie! Express yourself! Go on, Mrs. Avranche. We're your friends. Do you all have drinks? Yes, everything is perfect. You're all so great, I feel like crying. Mrs. Avranche. What's happening to me, Robert? Everything's just fine, darling. You must excuse her, gentlemen. We Parisians are touched by your warmth and hospitality. -How long have you been here? -A week. Happiness frightens me. It's been ages. -Do you think it'll last? -Of course. We've made it out of the tunnel. We won't let anyone harm you, dear lady. You're safe here. They're so sweet! Have you had the pleasure of meeting our dear friend? -Who? -Donatienne. Your friend's named Donatienne? Of course! The one and only! Care to meet her? -Right now? -No time like the present! She's my neighbor. Quite a lovely girl! -She's a stone's throw away. -Don't go, darling. She lives in a house all alone. The atmosphere there is incredibly dreary. I can't pass up this opportunity! Did you hear that? She'll blow your mind. Satisfaction guaranteed. A short visit then. I'll be right back. Put on your pants, Mr. Avranche. Why must parties always end? You make us wanna dance and once we're in a party mood, you stop the music. I never want it to stop. Start the music again! Ever noticed that loneliness has a smell? You're right. Like it oozes out of the walls. And the closer we get to the bedroom, the stronger the smell becomes. Feel it? Thick and stifling. Glad you came, right? She's fast asleep. -Want a peek? -Don't wake her! She loves that! Soon she'll be panting! Ready? Turn around, Mr. Avranche. You can expect quite the shock. The scene is set in a darkened room. You've just broken in! Your eyes grow accustomed to the dark. And there she is! I'm not Donatienne. I'm Carmen! I was having a beautiful dream! Who'll give me my dream back? -What was it about? -Love! He was wonderful! He gave me flowers and kissed my hand! You'll find him. -Where? In this dump? -Your dreams. Go back to sleep. -Close your eyes. -Sleep with me. I can't. I've got a date with Donatienne. Know where she is? To hell with her! I'm not her stand-in! I've got an ass and breasts too! And loving arms! -I just need something to love! -Sorry. I didn't expect this. Please calm down! Not without some tenderness! Just a smidgen. I'll calm her down. -I've got a really great line. -I've heard 'em all! But you'll see, mine is special. Where's Donatienne? When she's really down, she sleeps in the kids' room. I'll show you. Follow me! It's good to be home. -Isn't she up there? -No. -Then where is she? -I don't know! We're worried about her! -I hope she's okay. -She's usually out all night. She sleeps with perfect strangers. What if something happened to her? What would we do? -You're all in love with her. -Of course. I first slept with her at a kids' party. She'd brought hers before she lost custody. They were really having fun. Then, all of a sudden, we were alone in the bathroom. We looked at each other and smiled. She asked me how I felt. I replied, "Same as you!" Then she locked the bathroom door. Where'd you go? I was mowing the lawn one day. She came up and asked, "Are you mowing the lawn?" I said yes. She asked, "Do you enjoy doing that?" I replied, "My wife told me to do it." It was a summer evening. She wore a sheer dress. The sun was setting behind her. I can't forget. I thought, "Put your hands around her waist." "Caress her bare arms." She gave all of us hard-ons. But in the nicest kind of way. -I slept at your house once. -I know! A whole night. His wife was giving birth at the hospital. I'd put my nightie in my coat pocket. I crept in, quiet as a mouse, and slipped into bed with him. She said, "My heater broke down. Can I sleep here?" I was a married man, in my wife's bedroom, in our marriage bed. Sleeping with my neighbor! A dream come true! How she could make a man dream! She's our ray of sunshine. Let's stop reminiscing, because at this rate, we'll never stop. Mr. Avranche is still waiting for his love scene. -Party's over. Night, dear. -Good night, Émile. -Avranche is a nice guy. -I certainly think so. What's more, he looks you straight in the eye. -That's rare these days. -Especially for a garage owner. Describe the love scene. Tender. What's tenderness like? It's when you feel vulnerable… with someone. You feel that way now? I feel fragile. Because you had too much to drink? Yeah, I can't deny it. Why do you drink? Why do you screw? I enjoy it. Really? Or do you fake it? Do you pretend to drink your beer? Or do you pour it down a hidden tube? Your eyes tell me no. I can see the beer. When I look into your eyes, all I see is your eyes. You don't see other guys? No. How about beds? The tons of beds I've been laid in? Small ones, big ones, soft ones, hard ones, banging against the wall. See them? No. You're really wasted then! Do you need the bedroom? Any idea what I'm dealing with? It's like wading in glue that sticks to your feet. Look! He's in a romantic haze! A sentimental machine. He'd demoralize any woman! -I think he's nice. -Really? Then he's all yours. Have a good trip. Send me a postcard! You're in trouble, pal. In deep trouble. You should've fallen for me. As I told you when the story began. I reached out to you. Damn! He's totally zonked. Shall we put him to bed? He'll be fine here. It's his chair after all. Drunks are vile. So are lowlifes who sneak out on innocent girls! Look, honey, I've got a wife and kids at home. I can't just disappear. He's pulled it off! Doesn't he have a wife and kids? Don’t ask me. I don't know the guy! I don't know him! You spineless vermin! Go on back to Paris! We don't need you here! It's closing time, miss. I came here to dance. I'm not leaving until I do. Nobody wants to dance with you. Stranger things have happened, you know. Closing time, boys. Come on. I've got to drive the kids to school. Isn't this a nightclub. Is the sun up yet? -Not yet. -So it must still be night. Meaning the party's still on. More champagne! And stop sniveling. We're closed, sir. I just want a beer. My last beer. I get the feeling this is the end. How silly. What's a story without love? Or kissing or hugging? What planet are we on? And where are your kids? I'd like to meet them. Maybe we'd get along. I'm sure they're cute. I have kids of my own. Two little girls. Ages six and ten. Be reasonable, Donatienne. Let's go for a coffee, just the two of us. Coffee and croissants. Forget it. She's already left. Who the hell cares? Hear me, Duval? Who the hell cares? Are you Donatienne Pouget? Who's Donatienne Pouget? The woman who lives here. But l live here. -Since when? -I moved in this morning. But Donatienne… Where is she? Who is Donatienne? Donatienne lived here, in this very house. I was in love with her. Care for some black coffee? Sorry, I haven't had time to go shopping. Donatienne, please stop. -I'm not Donatienne. -You sure look like her! You must've been through a lot. I'd like to stay here. With me? I won't bother you or even talk to you. You won't notice I'm here. You can't stay alone in this dreary place. You'll get depressed. I'm already depressed. I'm getting a divorce. I'm through with men. I wanna give a woman some flowers. Of course, sir. What kind? -I don't know. -What kind of woman is she? I don't know. Like every other women. Then I suggest you get something cheap. Some buttercups, perhaps? Fine. You don't look well. I don't feel well. Are you ill? Your hands are shaking. True enough. Would you like a hot drink? -Something cold, actually. -How about a beer? It's good for what ails you. -Really? -Of course. You can't let yourself go. Come with me. Take a good look at this room. What's most striking about it? The refrigerator. The room is built around it. It's the room's raison d'être. Have a seat. -Comfy? -Yes. Watch, Mr. Avranche. I reach out, and without getting up, I'll open the fridge. And what will I find inside? Good Lord! They're all here. Dark, light, from Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg. Not to mention the gueuze, which will blow your head off. That's what you need, one good gueuze after another. Or three in a row. Until you forget everything. You've got too many memories. Face it. Who's Donatienne? A souvenir stashed away in the back of your memory. But did she ever really exist? In our valley, there was once a Donatienne Pouget. A young woman of loose morals who drove men wild. There's one in every valley, of course. Once over the ridge, there's another valley. Once you've seen them all, there are no more valleys. ‪There are nothing but plains. ‪What do you find there? Cities, Mr. Avranche. How can you find a woman in a city? And in which one? Milan? Basel? Frankfurt? Be reasonable. The story's over now. Drink your gueuze and go home. Doesn't she have a family somewhere? A father, a mother, a grandmother? Someone who knows where she is? She had a girlfriend. Marie-Thérèse, a childhood friend. Marie-Thérèse Carroz. Who knows what's become of her? Do you know Marie-Thérèse Carroz? -Marie-Thérèse who? -Carroz! Seems she grew up here. That doesn't mean she stayed. Besides, her name is no longer Carroz. It's Marie-Thérèse Chatelard. But they moved away. -Where'd they go? -To another village. -Which one? -A village! Should I tell a stranger? I'm no stranger. I'm Robert Avranche, the garage man! I'm lost and looking for someone! I'm tired and cold! Simmer down, sir. We'll track down Marie-Thérèse. What if I told you she was a schoolteacher? Would you like that? Schoolteachers are heartening. It'd be a nice change. -Go ahead, jump! -Jump! Now let's do jumping jacks. Laurent, get up! And up you get! Spread your arms and legs. Okay, good. Now watch me. Stretch out your arms and inhale. One, two, three. Arms down, exhale. Arms up and inhale. One, two, three, exhale. One, two, three, exhale. Arms back up. One, two, three, exhale. Reach high. Palms up. Two, three, exhale. Reach behind you. One, two, three, exhale. Back up, one, two, three. Looking for someone? Marie-Thérèse Chatelard. Upstairs in the classroom. Exhale, arms down, and slowly up. Come on, Grégory. Push, push, push. Back up and take a deep breath. Don't worry. She's only a woman. Knock and go in. -I'm her husband. -Robert Avranche, garage owner. Is it about a car? Not exactly. About a missing person, rather. -Someone is missing? -Yes. Someone your wife should know. Let's ask her. After you. "The little house with the chimney…" Hear that voice? -Yes. -That's my wife. "Down in the valley…" comma, "…crowned… Crowned… by the eternal snows. Eternal snows," period. She wasn't a tramp. She did it for free. Nor was she a witch. Everybody liked her. What was she? A nymphomaniac? What does that mean? A pathological desire for sex? Well… Did she want nothing but sex? I don't know. I never screwed her. I could've if I'd wanted to. Whenever she came over, she was all over me. I'd say, "You're my wife's best friend. I can't." I didn't want to come between them. But they had a fight anyway. Did you lust after her? No, honey. I never said that. But let's be honest, if a woman keeps buzzing around you, you start getting dizzy. Feeling ill? -No, why? -You look pale. Are you sick? No, I'll be all right. No doctors around here. I call a copter when the kids are sick. Don't worry. I'm okay. Is this Donatienne's doing? Probably. You're in love? Well, then… No wonder you look so tired! Being in love with Donatienne is no walk in the park. He's really got it bad. Look at his eyes. He looks half-crazy. Like a man lost in a storm. Hear me, Mr. Avranche? I'm talking to you. He's not responding. Mr. Avranche! It's Chatelard, the schoolteacher! You're in a mountain village. My wife invited you to dinner. Thank you. You're very kind. You're in no condition to drive. We'll put you up. We'll fix up the guestroom. You just need a cup of tea. Tomorrow's another day. Drink this. It'll help you sleep. I don't wanna sleep. You should. It's late. I certainly need to sleep. I have class tomorrow. Shall I tell you a bedtime story? What kind of story? I don't know. Don't you like stories? Depends on the story. How about one that happens on a train? May I sit down? Please. A guy's sitting alone in a first-class compartment. Not bad-looking. His name's Robert Avranche. He seems depressed. As if he's just lost the woman he loved. Has he? Yes. Does he need consoling? He sure wouldn't mind. He sets down his bowl, which is out of place in a love scene. Especially a bowl of hot tea. Is this a love scene? I think so. -With a schoolteacher? -No, she doesn't work. She just hangs around. -In train stations? -Yes. Sometimes she gets on a train. Her name's Donatienne. She never smiles. Why not? -Because nobody kisses her. -Why not? Sounds crazy, but men just want her ass. It never occurs to them to kiss her. -I'll kiss you. -Wait! I'm not in your compartment yet. Now you're alone, bored, sad, lost in thought. I've been watching you for ten minutes. You're thinking of the woman you've lost. Why don't men think of me like that? What's her name? Donatienne. Where the hell is he? Think he missed the train? Must we search the whole car? Wake up, Robert. This is your stop. Just leave me alone. I'm with the schoolteacher. Where the hell are we? Where are you taking me? To a woman's house. Robert! -Robert! -Cut it out, Robert! -I don't want to see any woman! -Please! She's cracking up! Tough! We're all cracking up nowadays! I'll handle this. She's forgiven you. She wants you to come back. You can't say no to Geneviève. What about the other guy? -Is he still there? -She never loved him. She was fed up being unhappy. He was the first to come along. You guys piss me off. You really do. Daddy! My babies. It's the story of a man who returns to his wife. Does she want him back? She's been waiting. Will she smile? Better pack your bags, pal. Party's over. THE END
