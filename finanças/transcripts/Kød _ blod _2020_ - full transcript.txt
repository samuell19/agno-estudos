People I don't even know ask me all sorts of questions. About my aunt. And my mum. They say we have plenty of time. That we'll figure out what went wrong together. But for some people things go wrong before they even begin. Can you hear me? Hanne? Hanne? There's cardiac arrest. What happened? Had she been drinking? You know it's not your fault. I actually really liked your mother. - But in order to help an addict... - I know. I spoke to your aunt. You can stay with them. - Can't I live on my own? - You shouldn't be on your own right now. What? Is there something I should know? - I don't know them. - You'll get to know them. Your aunt and her family really want to help you. I think you should let them. - Do you recognise it? - No. You were very little last time you were here. Let's see who's hiding in the basement. - Hi, Mum. - Hi. - How did it go today? - Fine. - What's that? - I broke a window. Poor thing. I'm sorry about your mum. Thank you. You're too baked, sweetheart. - So only you and Mads live here? - And David. - Do you remember him? - Yes. He thinks he can come and go as he pleases, but he's a good boy. Well, I'm his mother, so I have to say that. Let me know if you need anything. I'm glad you're here, Ida. - Who do we have here? Good morning. - Good morning. Sit down. Do you want this? - Do you drink coffee? - Yes, please. - Did you sleep? - No... - Can I have some? - Sure. I can't even imagine how you must feel. I remember your mum well. She used to play with us in between clients. She was funny. - Will you be ready in five? - Yes. But she had a bad temper, your mum. - She once threw a shoe at my head. - Do you want to sit with Ida? You must have done something. Perhaps David and I had been spying on the girls and their clients. - I was 12. - Why wasn't I there? - Because you're a little shit. - Do you have the accounts for me, Marie? Yes, I left them in the hallway. Ida, I think you should come with me today. Fine. I'll take her. Yes, you love that plate, don't you? But it's Ida's. Come to mummy. Please take the plate, Ida. - Can you eat on the way? - Yeah. Come on. Come on! Hey! This is my niece. Ida. She's moved in with us. Alright. Will you show her around? And she's only 17. Understood. Hello. Come with me. Hi. Call Jonas and tell him you spoke to me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Isn't it a great place? - Who was she? - Someone who needs to borrow money. So we have to see if we can help her. Does the council pay you for housing me? No, we don't get paid, Ida. We get a little child support as long as you're 17, but it's nothing. Lars, I'm leaving. It looks fine. Let's go. I'm sorry. Let's go out and spend that child support. So you know I'm not saving it for a rainy day. It's fine. I think we should. Have you finished this? Then let's get the hell out of here. - Someone's having a party. - It sounds like it. Should we take a look? - Hey, Mum. - Who do we have here? - It's just me. - Just you. Hi, David. - So you found your way home? - Yes. I missed you. My sister dies, and you don't answer your phone. I didn't know Hanne. You didn't speak to her. I needed you. And you weren't there. David. So this is David. - And that's Ida. - Hi, Ida. Hi. I'm sorry. - You fucking scared me. - I'm sorry. Are you David's girlfriend? I don't know if he would call me that. At least not to my face. - Are you alright? - Yeah, I just got a fright. I meant about your mum. I don't know... Life is so fucking random sometimes. That's why I got this. Look! Carpe Diem. It's Latin for YOLO. It's awesome, right? - Good morning! - Good morning. Hi, Mum! - Hello, old boy. - Ida's coming with you today. Great. Has David eaten? I don't know. I'm not going down there as long as she's here. - Don't you like her? - She hates me. David! So that's what I should have done. - Come on! - Relax. You only just got here. Is Anna having breakfast? She left. She knows she's not welcome. She's not good for you, David. - Your boyfriends have all been great... - David! What do you want? I'm not an idiot. You need to take care of yourself. And eat breakfast with your family like a civilised human being. Okay? Why is she coming? Don't mind him, Ida. Whenever he's been away, he tends to forget the rules. We're polite to one another. And we're glad you're here, Ida. Do you need a slap? Do you? Do you want another one? Are you ready? Are you? I've missed you, man. There we go! - Are you not going in? - No, the boss doesn't go in. We're not leaving until you can do it. You're such an amateur. I need to go as well. What's up, Ida? - Come on. I'm cold! - Shut up! Bye! Come on! What the fuck are you doing? You're throwing a rock at my car! Are you stupid? - Where did it hit? - You stupid idiot! - Are you up for a quick game? - No, you're coming with me. Sleep tight, Ida. Do you want to play? I'll grab some beers. - You're good! - I told you. - Come on! - You come on. Can I see your breasts? No. I'll show you my dick. Don't tell my mum I asked. No, don't do that. That won't help you. I can't tell you right now. Call me in a few days. Yes. That's how it is. Bye. - Something wrong? - No, people are just impatient. - Did you have fun yesterday? - Yes, I did. That's why it's so quiet around here. We got back late. Should we try to revive them? - See you! - Bye! Hi, Sofia. Do you remember me? I'm a friend of your dad's. Do you want a ride? It's quicker than the bus. Come on. - Hi. - Hi. Did you have a good day at school? - You're in the fourth grade, right? - Yes. Do you like school? I didn't like school. Me neither. I like history. What do you like about it? - I don't know. - Sure you do. I like imagining all those people. I see. But there are all those numbers and dates you have to remember. I could never do it. Here we are. That's your house, right? Will you give your dad this from me? And tell him we drove you home. So he knows you didn't go with strangers. - Bye. - Bye. What if he doesn't have the money? Once I speak to the children, they usually do. It's really cute! It's so nice to finally have a baby girl to buy presents for. - This is from Nana. - It's beautiful. Look. It will look lovely on her. Are you losing interest? That's Anna. - Now what? - Sorry? The two of you just need to get to know each other. - Just like with Marie. - Marie was never impolite. - You hated her for years. - No! Why are you saying that? It's not true. At least Anna's trying. That's more than I can say about you. - Hi, honey. - Hi, baby. - Hi! - Hi. - I'm glad you could make it. - Thanks for inviting me. - I brought a present from David and me. - Thanks. - Do you want to hold her? - Yes, please! Hello. Hello, baby girl. You're six months old today. You're so cute. - Wow! - What is it? - It's meant to make them really clever. - We should get you one too, Mads. Shut up! Look at this. Look what you got. So you can become clever. - Isn't it fun? - Did giving birth hurt, Marie? - What? - What do you think? Yes, it's pretty painful. It's painful, but you get over it. Do you? - Take some cake, whatever you like. - Thanks. - We need to collect the money faster. - I know what I'm doing. - Then why am I getting phone calls? - Do we have to talk about that now? Yes, when we're all in the same room. - Ida, please go into the other room. - It concerns her too. Maybe we're not tough enough. That's easy for you to say. You're not there. I can ask Chase if they want me, but I doubt they'll want my old tits. That's not what I meant! So what do you suggest? I'm going to check on Anna. Is he using again? - I don't know. - You don't know? Why aren't you looking out for your brother? I taught you to always look out for each other. So you took my cigarettes? I'm sorry. I'm actually trying to cut down. - Can I tell you something? - Of course. Fuck it, pass me one of those. OK. Guess. I don't know. What is it? I'm pregnant. That's why I came along today. Aren't you happy for me? Yes, of course. We just need to get our own place. I don't want him living here when we have the baby. I do not want to end up like Marie. Why do you think your mum stayed clear of them? They're insane. - I'm going back inside. - We're talking. - You didn't know my mum. - No, but I know she loved you. Hey... - Stop it. - No, I won't. Are you ready? Yeah. Good. Hey. Easy now... Just let her pass, and we'll go. Easy... Dad? How do I know you won't come back? Calm down. It's a misunderstanding. How do I... What did you do? - What happened? - Drive! Is he dead? David! Is he dead? Fuck! Hey... It'll be okay. We'll figure it out. Right? Ida? Ida! Have a seat, Ida. What's up? What happened? I don't want to live with my aunt anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. You have to tell me what happened, so I know how to respond to it. I'm glad you come here when there's a problem, but... You have to speak to me, or I can't help you. Ida? I have half an hour before my next meeting. I'll make us some coffee. We have plenty of time. There, there... There, there, darling. Where were you? We looked for you. Nowhere. You must have been somewhere. - At a gas station. - All night at a gas station? That's enough. - Is he dead? - We think so, but we're not sure. It hasn't been on the news yet. - What if she's still alone with him? - Why wasn't she at school? Children get sick. They often get sick. You need to double check these things before you enter. - Don't you want breakfast? - I already ate. Come with me. We need to wash your clothes. What are you doing? Get out! Why did you run away like that? Why did you run? Why didn't you stay with the rest of us? Get out, Jonas. Leave! Leave, Jonas! Get out! Besides that she's really easy and mild-mannered. Yes, we were lucky with you. Weren't we? - Hi, Ida. - Hi. You didn't turn up for the assessment meeting. - I must have forgotten. - I haven't seen a letter about a meeting. - It's all electronic now. - Why don't you have the meeting here? Unfortunately all my papers are at the office, but thanks. Ready, Ida? I'm sorry you came all the way out here. It was nothing. Everything's fine. Let's not talk about it here. Come in. This is Jonathan. My friend from the police. He's very keen to talk to you. Don't be frightened, Ida. Omar's just worried about you. And if he's worried, I'm worried. Maybe you can explain why you came to see me this morning? It was just an argument about allowances. I wouldn't have come if I'd known you'd turn it into such a big deal. You wanted to live alone when your mum died. Why was that? I don't know. I understand. I don't think you should have been placed with them either. Did your mum tell you stories about them? How they make their money? No. You don't have to live there anymore. We'll help you. - Can I leave now? - A man was killed in his home yesterday. His daughter saw a young girl who she recognised. Her description fits you perfectly. The girl had met you when you and a man gave her a lift home from school. Why did you drive her home? - I came because of an argument. - She saw you, Ida. Lots of girls look like me. Ida? Ida. If you're not a witness, you're a suspect. I won't be there next time. What did you ever do for me? There are options, an apprenticeship maybe. They're building new youth housing. Ida? Ida! What did he want? Ida? What did he want? The police were there. What did they say? He's dead. - Okay. - Shut up. He's dead! She saw me. The girl saw me. Hi, Mum. David? Mads? I need to speak to you. Now! What's with her? - I don't know. - That can't all be about me. - Are you mad? - No. - Are you sure? You seem mad at me. - I'm not mad at you. Fine. Do you want the last slice? - There's no topping. - I ate the pepperoni. Sorry. That's better. What's up? You need to leave. Are you talking to me? Are you? Leave. Screw you. What are you doing? What are you doing? Let me go! That hurts. Stop it. Stop it. - Anna... - Screw you! Ida? - Has she left? - Yes. Why were the police there? I panicked and went to see Omar. - Ida... - Bodil, I didn't tell them anything. I didn't tell them anything. ... they have nothing. - Then why did they show up? - They're guessing. They have nothing, Mum. - So they only asked about the car? - Yes. I got rid of it. They have absolutely nothing. They only sent one officer. It's guesswork. What's going on? Have you told them anything they can use against my boys? - Have you? Have you, Ida? - No! What did you tell them? You don't rat on family! - What did you tell them? - I didn't tell them anything. - You're destroying us. - Come on. I gave her something to help her sleep. David is gone. It's fucked up if he's out looking for drugs. Do you see what you've done? It's not my fault. Isn't it your fault? You went to see Omar, didn't you? What would you have done? Listen carefully... I will do anything for my family. Sweetie? - Did the police come to our house? - It's fine. Everything's fine. It's not a problem. No. How about this one? No, you don't like that. Never mind. She doesn't eat anything. Come on, sweetie. Yes... - We're going to go look for him. - Is he not picking up? No. Neither is Anna. - See you. - Come say goodbye. Here's Dad. Bye, sweetie. - Dad has to work. See you. - Are you coming, Ida? - Mads, we're leaving! - The most handsome dad in the world. Yes, the most handsome dad. Why aren't you answering your phone? Have you spoken to him? Fuck you. - Have you spoken to him? - You're so pathetic. What are you doing? Stop that. - Stop that. It hurts! - Jonas. Jonas! Don't fuck with us, do you understand? - Jonas... - Go away, Ida! Let go of me. Piss off, Jonas. - Have you spoken to him or not? - What did you make him do this time? - Anna... - What did you make him do? Come on. He doesn't tell her anything. He just fucks her. He tells me that you always stay in the car like a little bitch. - Ida, get her out of here. Now. - What the hell is wrong with you? - You're insane! - Go home, Anna! Why doesn't he pick up his phone? I hate it when he does this. - Have you told them? - My parents? They haven't even met David. - Can I have a look? - Sure. You can't really see anything yet, but my breasts are getting bigger. Can you hear anything? What is it? What is it? Are you sure you want to keep it? Maybe he doesn't want to be a dad. Has he said anything to you? He doesn't even call you his girlfriend. But I am his girlfriend, Ida. I know. But that doesn't mean you have to keep it. Why wouldn't I keep it? What's wrong? Sorry. I'm sorry I shouted at you. I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. They haven't come back yet? I don't know how to help them. I don't know how to help them. Come on. You're going to bed. The girl only saw you, right? Yes. Come on. Will you lie with me until they get home? - Hi. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Take this one. - Did you find him? - Yes. - How is he? - Not well. No thanks. The girl saw you, and we can't change that. They'll bring you in for questioning. You know that, right? You can help the boys, Ida. You can help David. You're a minor, and you have no criminal record. If they take... If they take all four of you, I'll have no one. What do you want me to do? Just don't tell them anything. Don't say anything. I know you can do that. Right, beautiful? Sweetie. Ida, you have visitors. There she is. Hi, Ida. - Is everything alright? - Yes. - Thanks. - It's so good to see you. - Where's Mia? - She's at the nursery. It's a long drive. - She made a drawing for you. - I'd call it doodles. - We miss you. - Are they treating you well? - Yes. - How are the other girls? They fight a lot. - But they're not bothering you? - Otherwise you let us know. Hey. The toilet was all the way down the hall. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - You're getting so big. - Isn't she beautiful? We don't know if it's a boy or a girl. And... Anna almost asked at her last scan. I had to cover her mouth. It should be a surprise. And we've done up the basement, so it's ready for the young couple. With a really lovely nursery. And David, should we put the baby changing table in the old utility room? I don't know, Mum. You decide. And Mia's really looking forward to getting a playmate. She'll probably be jealous once the baby's here. - No. The boys were never jealous. - Is that quite true? David, were you jealous of Mads? Perhaps David was a bit jealous of Mads to start with. But you were never jealous of the little ones. No. Your room looks the same. I'll come back soon. Let me know if you need anything. Bye. Bye. David... David! People I don't even know ask me all sorts of questions. They say we have plenty of time. That we'll find out what went wrong together. But for some people things go wrong before they even begin. - Do you want anything? - No thanks. I just need to sit down. My feet are aching. Mum? Breathe calmly. Anna! Breathe calmly. Relax! You're hurting your child. We need to take your pants off. Stop. - Take it easy, Anna. - I don't want it! Get it out! Get it out. Please... Won't you help me? Anna, it'll be fine. Get it out. I don't want it. There's a contraction. Push, push, push! And breathe. You need to try... And push. Take a deep breath and push. Well done! Breathe deeply, so the baby gets oxygen. There's another contraction. Breathe deeply and push. Listen to me! Breathe deeply and push. - Breathe... -... and push! Well done, Anna.
