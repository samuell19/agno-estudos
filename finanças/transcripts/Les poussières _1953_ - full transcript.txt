DUST The weight of free dust contained in the universe... is at least equal to the weight of the celestial bodies. Sun dust... Cloud dust... Called aerosol, dust in suspension has covered the world. The very ancient dust of the Sahara. Saline dust given off by the waves of the sea. The living dust of pollen. Heavy industrial dust. Dust from the stations of Paris. Dust of London fogs. In many regions, the quantity of dust spread in the air by industry is considerable. Mining cities, coated with dust, day and night, by the uninterrupted work of blast furnaces. Village petrified by the white dust of the lime-kilns. Dust of the loom. These fibrous shreds, hanging like vermin, indicate a company working with linen. The threshing machine, by breaking the linen fiber, makes a dust through which the natural light can hardly pass. In this atmosphere, a spotlight can play the role of a sun-ray. This spearheaded vegetal dust, seen here under the microscope, causes one of the many pulmonary infections called pneumoconiosis. Yet, among all varieties of dust, the deadliest is the dust from silica. If a living cell absorbs a particle of silica dust. noticeable here as white stains, the poisoned cell is quickly and totally destroyed. By destroying the pulmonary tissue, the silica dust causes the most serious of pneumoconiosis: silicosis. Some professions are especially affected by this disease. The sea, which turns the siliceous rocks into shingle, has caused the crumbling of the cliffs of Normandy, and left piles that have originated an odd industry: the grinding of shingle. Man, imitating the sea, turns the shingle into sand, but this sand, useful to industry, is dangerous for man. The silica dust spread by the grinding and the riddling of the shingle... has made necessary, after deadly accidents, the wearing of protective masks. Caught in the machines by the filtration system, a part of the dust is taken away by a water flow. This sand, with its various destinations, will be used for making rice powder, As well as for foundry work. Sanding down with a sand jet. The grains break against a foundry casting to sand it down, releasing siliceous dust particles, made even more toxic by being fine and fresh. It is a real break-out of the matter. The porcelain of Limoges is made of kaolin, of feldspar, and of pure silica. Made traditionally by the same worker, the crusting, the centring and the calibrating of the soft paste, will give its shape to the porcelain plate. After the drying, the plate is worked by the edge-maker. His position is one of the most exposed of the porcelain industry. With lathe and abrasive, the worker takes off the streaks and spreads an abundant siliceous dust. Suction hoses struggle to get more of the terrible dust away from the pulmonary alveoli. True acrobat, a diverting character, Here comes the kiln loader, carrying his fragile porcelain to the oven. Finishing work. The polisher, grinds away, using siliceous matter... the most understated defects of this enamelled porcelain... of which the transparency remains inimitable. He may feel perfectly healthy, the silicosis is here, detected by radiography. Silicosis nodules, in the "Snow storm". Mountains of the Alps, of which the pure climate revivifies silicosis patients. Mountains ringing out with the thunder of landmines. Crossed over by galleries, its siliceous rock is broken down with dynamite. The explosion releases a dust cloud, the most dangerous of all dusts. Some samples are taken, with devices equipped with special filters. Sent to the laboratory, the dust collecting filter... is dissolved into a solvent. The dust, remaining in suspension in the liquid... is isolated... and examined under a microscope. This permanent bustle of dust... Is called the Brownian motion. After being weighed, the dust is counted with a checkered scale. It reveals that the explosion clouds in the tunnels contain a record quantity of dust. More than 200 millions particles per liter of air. The microscopic examination of the dust shows that each of these particles... could be absorbed by a drop of water. This observation led to the technique of wet drilling, for the opening of the galleries. Wet drilling. The pneumatic drills allow, thanks to hollow drill-bits, the injection of pressurized water. This cuts down the amount of dust. The dust remained in suspension in the gallery... is suctioned by this conduit or duct. If the spider web is probably the first dust filter Nature may have known... This experimental room of 2000 m3... is certainly unique in the world. It's used to test industrial devices for filtering dust. The combustion of these candles creates a dust whose specifications are precisely known, and that are used to experiment with reduction devices, such as this Cyclone type extractor, which has many industrial applications. In the collieries, dust removal is indispensable, due to the large amount of dust spread. The dust spread in the making of coal nuts, contains pitch, a product dangerous to the skin. Workers are protected by covering their face with talc. Silence - On Air Les Mis√©rables In these workshops, the dust captured is led to the extractor... by suction conduits. External view of the installation. The trees of the forest have disappeared from the valley, Just like the wood-cookers. And the coal industry has locked its servants into mills. But where there's locking, there is dusting, And modernization is used to fight what it has partially been creating. The very fine charcoal dust, powerfully suctioned, Falls here into the bags of a filtering extractor. The technical effort is completed by manpower. Dust coloured landscape. It was black in the mines, it is white at the cement works. An important industrial achievement. The electrostatic filter electrifies the factory dust, which goes into a chamber. It then falls into an underpass approach, from which only gas is evacuated outside. The power cuts, that stop the extraction, prove its usefulness by thinking that this dusty cloud now being rejected into nature, was inside of the cement works. In the fight against dust, the wearing of an individual mask must sometimes complete or replace collective protection. Before being used by workers, the models are tested on a wooden head with mechanical breathing. Nevertheless, despite all these professional security efforts, the frightening question remains: The hard working man, the man of linen, the man of the rock, and his brother, the man of the deep, the man of fire, man more powerful than the elements he disciplines, will he be preserved against the deadly radioactivity of atomic dust, this aerosol that threatens the world.
