Wrong voice profile. - Let's get out of here! Get in, Maja, in! Come on! Siv Leander. - I'm stuck. - Come out. - What's she saying? - She says she's stuck. - Yes. - They got in here quickly. - We have a good alarm. The alarm will stop everything at the museum. - Yes, yes, the alarm seems to work. - Thanks for the test. We'll need two—no, three—four. Four. - Tjing tjing! - Four, eh? - Four Larmax 3000 for the museum. - Five alarms is absolutely ridiculous. - No no, not at all. Come closer. This is carefully planned. We set one alarm—there. And one there. No, not there. We need one alarm to secure the other alarm. - We double up there. - No. You can't see the museum for alarms. - But security must— - Don't you understand? Carl-Magnus Granath is coming, with his fantastic auction. He's a legend. I'm saying that's enough now. - And I'm saying Safety First. - Are more alarms really necessary? - Barbro has Krister, after all. - Krister? He's older than most of the stuff he's looking after! - Leaving security to Krister is like— - Hello? - What? Oh Krister, hello. - We're just trying to offer you a little help. - I'm grateful. You can never have too much help. Especially when so many people are coming. - Yes, I know. - Everything needs to be in place by the time Carl-Magnus Granath gets here. - You can rely on us. Have you read this? - What? Is this true? They're going to merge our police station with Kristinelund's? - Yes, that's the plan. - Why? - So one station has to be closed down? - Either Kristinelund's or ours. - The best commissioner gets to stay. - No no no, don't start to celebrate a victory we haven't won yet. When Carl-Magnus Granath's auctions—come to—the museum today— Yes—like that. Yes. Then there. It means a lot of people will be coming. - They want to sell valuable items. - Maja. Those auctions have had thefts in the past. - Exactly right. But not only that. - What? Is there something we don't know? - The Art Shadow. Or Pålette Hasselbacken, as she's called. Specialist in stealing valuable items. - The one who wears disguises. - And leaves lip prints. But she's in jail. - She was. She was released last winter. - Maja, what if she comes here? - Do you know what this is? Can you see the signature? Picasso. The world's greatest artist. - Oh. Yes, yes. I'm not an expert, but I think my one is fine. - This art is classic. Yours is just basic. Here he comes: Carl-Magnus Granath. - That's him? - No, that's his assistant. - Bonjour, Valleby! - That's him. - Fantastique to be here. - Carl-Magn— - Bonjour, monsieur! Beautiful. Let us know if is heavy. We help bear it in. See you there later. Madame. Les oiseaux. - Carl-Magnus Granath. - Ah, Barbro Palm. - Yes, that's me. - Oh. Enchanté. Welcome to Valleby. Are you staying at the hotel? No. Non, non, non. I rent the small house outside the city. You must come say hello. - Isn't that what I'm doing now? - I mean it. Do come say hello! - Yes, yes. Hello hello. Barbro Palm. - He's pronouncing the phrasal verb incorrectly. - You mean visit. Yes of course. What an honour. - Yeah. - Now, shall we go in and see where the auction will take place? Entrez, entrez, mesdames et messieurs. Make a queue. On Saturday, the hour will finally be here for Granath's auction sales. A highlight for everyone longing to hear: Going once—going twice—sold! So come at me with your valuable things so I can assess them. - Vite. - Exactly. Krister, please. - I was first. - What was that? Bonjour, monsieur. What wonderful painting have you that I can sell for you? - We art connoiseurs will recognise it immediately. - Absolument. - How much do you think it might be worth? - Maybe 300. - Million. - No. Non non non. - 300,000? - Non. Kronor. - What? - 300 kronor. - For a Picasso? - Ah. Nya— Not Picasso. P, full stop, Inkasso. Look here. The signature. Debt recovery. Unfortunately. Not something I can sell. So sorry. C'est la vie. - All right? Thanks. - You understand— How do you say— Appearances can be deceivings. - Krister. Go on. - Yes. Bonjour, monsieur. - Good morning. My name is Krister Lönn. - Bonjour, Krister Lynn. - I'm a night watchman at the museum. - Good Lord. Fear of the Dark. - Yes, I do suffer a little from that. - Non non non. The painting. That is its name. "Fear of the Dark" by Siri van Ockel. Yes, it's—It's— - Where have you got it? - From my mother a long time ago. - What a wonderful present. There are those will give millions kronor for it. Take good care of your valuable painting. And be sure to bring it to Granath's auction on Saturday. Thank you, Krister Lynn. - Lönn. - Lunn. - Did you understand? First the code, then your thumb. Then the red lamp starts to flash green. Red. A green lamp starts to flash red. Yes. What? Yes. Exactly, yes. - Yes. - Yes. Yes go ahead. - Code—thumb— And then green lamp, which flashes—red. - Good. Don't forget to set the alarm once we're gone. - No. - And you have to sit absolutely still. - Otherwise, it'll screech everywhere. - Come on. - Here, if the night gets boring. - Good night, Krister. - Good night. If there's such a thing as a good night— Absolutely still? Larmax? If I've managed all these years, I can manage a little longer. Ah, only you. Right— What— What? My—painting. Mama's painting! - Krister Lönn's painting's been stolen. - Sally Solo. You don't hang around at Vallebybladet. - Have you a comment? - Not just now, actually. - "Actually, none." How could this have happened? You installed alarms only yesterday. - Yeah, I don't know. I have no idea. - "No idea." Is there anything else you don't know? No, I don't know. I— - No, he didn't know that either. - But one thing I do know: We'll catch the thief. We always do here in Valleby. You can put that. - Yes of course. I'll do that. I'm so stupid. Stupid! Why didn't I set the alarm? - Listen to him. He didn't even set the alarm. - It's terrible. We install alarms here to ensure— Wait—What's this? - What if Sally writes about this? - Then which station's going to be closed down? - That's one way to look at it. But that could also be the best thing that could happen. - What did you say? - It's terrible, Krister. It's terrible, I know, but— And this: this must be the work of the Art Shadow. If we catch her, we're heroes. And no one shuts down our police station. - But how do you know it's the Art Shadow? We have lip prints. The Art Shadow took Krister's painting. The Art Shadow is actually called Pålette Hasselbacken. And this is what she looks like, when she isn't in disguise. - Did you find anything about "Fear of the Dark"? - Yes, actually. But only about a rich art collector. Anton af Stridh. He owned Krister's painting, but that's 50 years ago. Then a scandal made him poor. - That's when Krister's mother bought the painting. - Exactly. And after that it was with Krister for all those years. The Art Shadow could only know Krister had it if she was at the museum today. - Then maybe she'll be there today. - C'est magnifique. What a wonderful icon. - Bring it to the auction the day after tomorrow. - Thank you—so much. It is me who should thank you, la prêtresse. From the bottom of my heart. - Right. There we are. - Barbro Palm, I heard about the theft here at the museum. It's terrible— - It's disgusting. - You should know that even in these such circumstances— it is refreshing to bump into you. - Pardon? - What I try to say— - is that—is wonderful to bump into you. That we encounter— - Always nice to bump into you too, Carl-Magnus. - Oui oui oui. So let's move on. I am very happy so many have come. I very much looking forward to Saturday auction. Bonjour Mademoiselle. - Could it be him? Him over there with the camera and the odd beard. - What, the Art Shadow? - We'll soon know. ... 1970s. Maybe you get five kronor for it. Maybe. - Hello. - Goodbye. - Oh la la, what do we have here? No—is it—? It can not be true. Is it—mon Dieu—Necker! Yes, well— But you, you probably wonder why I get so excited by simple cuckoo clock. But me, Carl-Magnus Granath reply: appearances can be deceivings. It takes—it takes time. There, Ladies and Gentlemen, the only monkey clock of the world! It is a real gem. Worth millions kronor. - Lasse, come here. - Yes, send? - No, for real. Come here, get in here. - I don't quite understand, over? - I think I've found her. I thought: Now it's coming into the right hands. - Did you see an old lady run out? Like a 100 years old, grey hair wearing a brown coat? - Super fast. - Super fast? Like a 100 years old? - Yeah - No. Maja, she could be anyone. - Is that hers? - Who? Gabriella. What are you doing here? I was just passing by. I'm so bored. I've captured 14 villains this month alone. - This is Gabriella. She's the commissioner in Kristinelund. - Hi. Maja. - Lasse. - Hi, hello, hello, hello. - Lasse and Maja often help here in Valleby. - Oh really? Children? - Yes. - I heard about your painting theft. God, it's such a shame. - Yes yes— But we're working on it now, aren't we. - Absolutely. - We'll catch the villain soon. - We'll see. Have you had time to read the Kristinelundspost? - No. - Then you can have it. Keep it. It says some really nice things. About me. Yes, good luck. - Thanks. - Have a good day. - You too. - Bye. "Kristinelund's commissioner has done it again." "The cake villain confesses everything." "The police forced me to confess." - I've never heard of a cake villain. - No, exactly. That's nothing compared to the Art Shadow. We have to catch her. We need to find out more about the Art Shadow. - Ah, the Art Shadow. What have I done to that disgusting woman? Why she pursuing me? She is précisément like a shadow. - Impossible to ap—appr— - Apprehend? - Appren. Yes. - Appre—hend. - Oui oui oui. - What about the stolen painting "Fear of the Dark"? - Yes— - Do you know anything about it? - We found someone called Anton af Stridh. We thought you might know more? - Necker, Necker! It's burning! - You'll have to take your trousers off. - Not here. - Excusez-moi. Three seconds. - Necker, quick. Water, water, water. Larmax 3000. Maja. - I'm just having a quick look around. - What if he comes? - You have to be inquisitive, Lasse. Otherwise you'll never find anything out. - What's this? - Yes, yes, Necker. It'll be fine. - Close it, Maja, he's coming. - There, that's better. My apologies, Me, I am just so clumsy. Unfortunately, I cannot any more help you. Otherwise, I would like to. - But tell me something. If you were the thief, what would your next target be? - Good question, Maja. If I, Carl-Magnus Granath— was the thief— I have it. L'icône de la prêtresse. The priestess icon. - No no, I don't need an alarm. I think God keeps a careful eye on his own house. - But we can still set a little trap. -That's it. - Yes, yes. Good night. You're in safe hands. - Thank you. - Look out. Help! Help! - Help me! - The trap. There's been a break-in at the café. Get this thing off! - A biscuit? - Yes, please. Lovely. So that clock was important to you. - Yes. At least—well, the monkey was quite loud. Yes, so I can put "very important monkey clock". Or "irreplaceable monkey clock". That's better. Much stronger. That's it. And then, "Valleby residents—". - are shattered. - Not sure about shattered. - Yes, absolutely shattered. Yes, and now everyone is thinking: What are the cops doing? - We're working on it. - Oh, "we're working today". This is news in Vallebybladet. May I write that you do actually work? Art Shadow. So how are you going to do this? Do you have a clue? - I'm just looking for one. - Looking for clues. Very strong. - "Looking for—" Yes. - Can you put that it was stolen from Café Bernard? No, I can't, we don't advertise. - Hi. - Hello. - Oh thank you. - You're welcome. - I don't understand it. Why did she take Sara's monkey clock? - And not the minister's precious icon? - No. - Two thefts in two days. - Sally was right. - That'll hardly impress the ones making the decision. - No. You can almost hear them laughing all the way from Kristinelund. - I'm the happiest man in all of Valleby. - What happened? - This happened. Yes, ugly as hell. But worth a fortune. At the auction tomorrow I will be a rich man. - That's wonderful. - Carl-Magnus Granath shed a tear. He said it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. - Did he? How nice. What's the connection between the thefts? Goodness, you're here? I just need some measurements. 15—yes— This lamp—is it yours? Or did you borrow that too? - Borrow? - No, it's ours. - If it turns out that I become commissioner here in Valleby— that will include this room. - What? Our room? - The premises of the commissioner, which you've been allowed to make use of. Oh that's so sweet! Did you see them do that on TV? Have you caught a thief? - Not yet. - But we know who it is. - Really? You know? - The Art Shadow. - Lasse! - How very skilful. Well, if I become Commissioner here, you'll be leaving this room immediately. Have a good day. She mustn't become commissioner in Valleby. Come on, let's get going. - Everything's disappeared from where Granath's auctons have been. - Yeah. There are lip prints everywhere. - Different things. How are they connected? Is there a pattern? - I think I see it. What we've missed. Everything that's been stolen is in that photo. You see? Sara's monkey clock. Krister's painting. And all the other stolen stuff. The Art Shadow's collecting af Stridh's collection. - There's only one thing hasn't been stolen yet. - Ron Hazelwood's statue. - Yeah. If we guard it the Art Shadow will come to us. Sellers and buyers, I want to thank you for the warm reception— There you are, where have you been? We've got something going on. We'll be back. One thing to deal with first. Ronny, the statue you showed us, where is it? - It's upstairs. - Show us it. Now. - Yes. Excuse me. I assure you it's safe. I locked the door. - No alarm? - No. - It's at the top. On the third floor. - Art Shadow. - Art Shadow? - Where's my statue? - Where did she go? - There. Stop! I'm not done. Stop! Helmets. Now we've got her. - Wow. Bold. - Stupid. Come on. Well, if it isn't Pålette Hasselbacken out on new adventures! - Where are you going? - It's not what you think. I'm innocent. I mean it. - That's what they all say. - But it's true. See for yourself. Where's the statue, then? I haven't got it. You don't have it. You and I are going to have such a nice time together. - Hello? Wait! - You two can thank me later. - Thank you? - Yes, for the help of the Kristinelund police. Valleby can't do it themselves. - It was us who found her. - Yes, but it was me who caught her. And that's what counts. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - Wait, wait. The statue was already gone. I was trying to catch the thief. It isn't me leaving napkins with lipstick. - No? Now I understand. It's someone pretending to be you. - Exactly! - Well, how strange. - So now what do we do? - I don't want to go to jail again. - No. You should have thought of that before. Bye bye! Silence. May I ask for silence? - Who did you catch? - You'll see. I have very pleasant news for you. I've just caught the villain behind all the thefts at Granath's auctions. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is none other than—the Art Shadow. - Wonderful. Do you have my statue? - And my painting? - Calm down, calm down. When she confesses, we'll find out where she has your things. - We screwed up. - Don't worry. It'll be OK. - Why are the Kristinelund police arresting people in Valleby? - Yes, you might well ask. I just wanted to help. It's my duty. Any more questions? - Will this have any effect on the merger? Will you be our commissioner now? - No idea. No idea. But we'll soon find out. I'm certain that those making the decision will make the best choice. - Can I take a picture? - Yes, of course. Oh. Stop. Would you please? Stop, stop, stop, please? - Stop, please! I can't take any more. - Well then, confess. - But I don't know. That's the truth. I'm innocent! - It's such a shame, but you force me— - Stop. - That's enough now. - Don't you want her to confess? - Not here. Not in my station. - Your station? It's only a matter of time. Until then, I decide. Get out of here. - Come on now, little man, let's calm down a bit. - What? - I just want to thank you. I've never been able to stand scratching noises. Especially police scratching noises. - Excuse me. - It's them. - It's them? Yes, hello? - Yes. Understood. - Yes. Understood. - Thanks very much. - Yes, thanks. - What did they say? - I'm so sorry. Thanks. Baton? Now you have no more police duties in Valleby. Thanks. Jacket. You can and will no longer work as a police officer. Understood? - Understood. Understood. - Yes, well—good luck, then. - Leaving already? - Yes. - But what about the tie? - Oh, sorry. It doesn't matter. What was it you said to me just now that was so incredibly good? Yes, that was it— "Until then, I decide." Hello, wait. - You can't do this. - We have to get her away from Valleby. - And get you back. - Didn't you hear? The decision's made. I— I'm not the commissioner any more. - Are you just going to give up? - So what happens to us? - Hello—say something. Sorry. What are you doing here? Sally. Good morning. Well. I wanted to give you and Vallebybladet a little gift. Already! My first day. - A gift? - How about an exclusive interview—with— the Art Shadow. Now. At once. - Oh thank you. Has she confessed? - Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes— And no. She's talking back to front. Yes, very tiring. Keep that in mind when you interview her. - What's she saying, then? - Like all villains she says she's innocent. Think of this as the start of a fruitful collaboration between us. Into the cage. Terrific. Then you'll be welcome tomorrow. - What? - You get the interview tomorrow. - It's supposed to be today. - No. - Yes. - Then we misunderstood each other. - No we didn't. - All right then. Have a good day. - Did Gabriella let you out? - She didn't have to. I'm an accomplished thief. Breaking in, breaking out—same thing. - Has she escaped? - Didn't you see what she put me through? I had to. Look, I'm innocent. That's the truth. Someone else has been stealing the artwork. Not me. So I have to find the real thief. You're both so smart—you might be able to help me. - What should we do? - I don't know. What if she's right? - Could someone else have stolen the things? - Yes, and if Gabriella has imprisoned someone innocent, she might get fired. - Then we'll get our commissioner back. - Yes. - Do you have lipstick with you? - You bet I have. - Right. Put some on. Get the lip prints. - Kiss the paper. Good. It's not her lip prints. - You are innocent. - That's what I've been telling you. If only you'd listened to me. - Hello? - Gabriella! Hide! I wanted to see how your packing's coming along. - Looking for something? - No—looking? Not at all. But if I were to look for something— It wasn't me. Then I expect you to tell me, or else there will be long interrogations. - Isn't it nice to stretch? - No, it isn't. - Come on, up you get! It's fun. - Fun? Sure, it's fun. - Art Shadow. I've got it! Look. Look. - Look at what? - Yes, what am I talking about? Look how much she has stolen. - Big things require a big hiding place. Don't they? - Yes and? And small things require a small hiding place. - God, you really are clever. Your old commissioner said you were clever. Well you're not. Hurry up and pack. I want this place empty and clean today. And that couch? Throw it out. It hisses when you sit in it. - She's gone. - Okay. If you didn't steal all the stuff, then who did? Could it be Anton af Stridh? Stealing his collection back? - Hardly. He must be over 90 by now. The scandal that broke him was about him selling fake carpets. Then he got caught and lost everything. - He fled to France and died a pauper. - That's so sad. All alone. - No, not completely alone. He had a partner, his son. - Klas-Martin! That's the connection! - What about Klas-Martin? - Got it now. What do all the thefts have in common? - I know! They happened at Granath's auctions. - Exactly. - And where does Carl-Magnus come from? - Norway? - No. - France. - Exactly. Carl-Magnus is af Stridh's son. He's stealing his father's collection back. What d'you say now, Dad? "Impossible," you used to tell me. But just look. The collection is complete. - Cheers, old girl. - Cheers. Just one last auction. Then it's all finished with Carl-Magnus Granath and his phony accent. The hot air balloon's in place? - It'll pick us up at the harbour at 9 o'clock. - Perfect. - He took advantage of Necker. - They made us think it was my lip prints. - Listen—we have to be sure it's Carl-Magnus. - We have to find the loot. - Yeah, but where? - The secret door in Carl-Magnus's library. We have to go there. He won't be at home, because the auction's starting soon. - Didn't he use the Larmax 3000? - Yes. So we're planning to break into a house that we think maybe we'll find the loot in? Which we think is maybe there? - Yes. - Yes. - Okay. - Pålette, you stay here. Carl-Magnus. We know it's late, but could you look at our painting as well? - Please? You have to take the opportunity when Carl-Magnus Gronat is in town. - Granath. - What? - It pronounces Carl-Magnus Granath. - We think it's really neat. - No. - What is this? She is like a fart in a perfume boutique. L'art de ka-ka. I can not possibly sell that. Go. Vite vite vite. - Sorry to have bothered you. And thanks. - Thanks, thanks. There. 123,000 kronor, did I hear that? Yes. Going once—going twice— And 124,000 kronor has been offered for this beautiful picture by Toulouse Latrine. - 124,000 kronor— Going once—going twice—Sold! Number 60. The picture is yours. Congratulations on a bon marché. We can gift-wrap it. Just tell us what kind of paper you want. Papier-maché or crepe. And now a vase from the Zhiong Dynasty.

Come on! - Where's the loot? - It should be here. - Now I don't understand anything. - It's possible it might not be Carl-Magnus. - Something's wrong. - No! - It's a trap. - Hello. Help. Open up! Hello. Open. Open. Is that the commissioner in Valleby? Yes, it's Necker. I have something here that will probably interest you. - At Carl-Magnus's manor? Brilliant. What? Lasse and Maja? Keep them there too. I'll take care of transport right away. Finally. God, how I've longed for this moment. Necker—Thank you, thank you, thank you. This time you really chose the wrong playmate. Now there's a special transport to my escape-proof dungeon in Kristinelund. Where long interrogations await you. Now you'll confess. - She's innocent. - We think we know who the real villain is. - Really? Who is it then? - Necker. - Necker? No—Necker? - Yeah. Necker? No. Necker? They say you're the real villain. - Yeah? - And they themselves are completely innocent. - Yeah? - Even when they broke into your house. Let's take a detour through Valleby first. Follow me. - Hello, it's Sally. - Sally, Sally, Sally, Sally. You can have the interview we talked about. - Yes, you can do it now. Right away. - Great. Sit down. - Here. - What is it? - Princess layer cake. I couldn't eat it all. - Come on. - You're the best! - You saved us. - No, I haven't saved anything. I've only bought us some time. Hey. Gabriella will catch on soon. Necker's car is coming. Where did she go? - After her! - Get back in! - Drive. - Yeah yeah. Sally, Sally, Sally ... I'm so pleased you could come. The Art Shadow's coming—now! - Any minute now, perhaps. Since we seem to have some extra time, maybe I can ask you a question. Absolutely. - You've been very good at getting villains to confess. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm pretty good at that, yeah. - I rang around a bit. Hardly anyone has recovered their stolen property. You have the confessions, but nothing of what was stolen. How do you account for that? - You're wrong. - What? - You're wrong. - I'm wrong? - Write that down. - Okay. "I am wrong." - No. We can't wait here. You'll be driven to Vallebybladet, of course. - Yes. - Yes. Then hop in the car. Yes, get a move on. - Everything's ready. - Perfect. C'est magnifique!. And I have food for the trip. See you at the ve— - Carl-Magnus, wait! Are you trying to sneak away? - Certainly! Non—yes—no. - You can't go without saying goodbye. - But certainly not. Farewell, Barbro Palm. - And we'll see you again, I hope. - Oui, oui. Au revoir! Because around here you really are "Going once—going twice—sold"! - You're smiling. - You say that I usually look grumpy? - Yes. Au revoir. - Au revoir. What's she doing here? Well done, Necker. - Carl-Magnus? Everyone is behind bars. - What about the hot air balloon? - It's on time. - Good. I'm going to have a quick look at the collection. Where've they gone? - Maybe we should get out. - No, no, wait! Not yet. - Sara's monkey clock. It's them. - Now we take them! "Behind bars," you said. - After him! - Okay. Hold on! - Step on it! Wait here. - Okay. Be careful. He went that way! Lasse! Maybe we should turn it off now, Maja. - It's stuck. - Welcome to the outside, Carl-Magnus. - I give up. - Or should we say: Klas-Martin af Stridh? - You have unmasked me. I'm sorry. Can you ever forgive me? I wanted to recover my Dad's collection. When I was a teenager, I sold fake carpets to my Dad's friends to make some pocket money. You know how it is. After all, you want enough to buy sweets and comics. When they found out, my father took the blame. He said it was him. So he had to sell his whole collection to save my skin. - So you just wanted it back. - He loved the collection. I had no choice. He was completely heartbroken. He cried and cried—and I cried. My mother cried. My sister cried. My sister's cat cried. The postman cried. But he had a cat allergy. That was why he cried. But there wasn't a soul who didn't cry. I felt I had to make it up to him. And the only way—was to steal the collection back. Do you understand? Have you any idea how hard it is for me to have to commit this crime— to make amends to my Dad? The monkey clock? Dad used to wind it— These are childhood memories for me. Okay, you little bastards, you have a choice to make. You either take me or save the valuable art in the car. Like taking candy from toddlers. Hurry up. - What? Where's all the stuff? - Where's the monkey clock? I've got the monkey clock. Come on! Hurry up. Bloody kids. That's not good. We no longer drive like that in Valleby. - Shut up and smile. Let me do the talking. Yes, that wasn't so good. We have speeding, reckless driving, misappropriation of receding hairline. - Are you going to confess here or at the station? - Directement, if that is the most fastest. - Kiitos. - Well hello! It's you and Necker. - Yes, we were a little in a hurry. Pardon. - Yes—no, well—that's fine. - So we can go now? - Of course. - Merci. - Thank you, thank you. - What kind of noise is that? - Noise? I hear nichts. - Oh yes, it sounds like a monkey. - He-he, it's ho-ho-ho— It is me actually. Ho-Ho. This is how I laugh. And Necker also. - Look, Gabriella's got them. - Maybe she's not so stupid after all. - Or—? - Good evening. Drive safely. Go, go. - What's she doing? - They're getting away! Faster! Move! Faster! Brake! - Everything all right? - Yes, I think so. - Carl-Magnus and Necker are in the car. - What are you doing? - Do you know who you're dealing with? - Yes, Carl-Magnus Granath. - No. With me. - Or Klas-Martin af Stridh. - The ones who are really behind it all. We tried to tell you, but you were only interested in confessions. Isn't that so? Not the ones who really did it. It wasn't me. It was Necker. Let go of me. - I—have actually caught 343 villains. Every one of them confessed. Every one of them confessed. Every one! You made everyone confess, even if they had nothing to confess. - No! - Yes! - No! - You certainly have! - No! - LasseMaja, I'll deal with this. It's all your fault. We should have done as I said instead. It wasn't my fault. - Yes! Just the person I wanted to talk to. - Yeah well— - About that interview. I'd like to do it now. With you. Now that you're not a commissioner any more ... That's why I want to welcome you all to the museum's new exhibition: af Stridh's stolen collection! - Krister. - What? - And to cut the ribbon: Valleby's very own police commissioner. - Thanks. Thank you, thank you, everyone. Thank you thank you. Yes, well—I wouldn't be standing here today— if it wasn't for two very special people. Lasse and Maja. Come up here and cut the ribbon.
