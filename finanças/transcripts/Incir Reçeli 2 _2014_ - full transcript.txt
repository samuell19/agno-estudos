Love. The indefinable feeling that inspires songs and movies. No one has ever written a romance about a girl who pukes in the crap toilet of some crap bar. They couldn't either. I bet no writer has been in love with a living corpse. If you can still drink tequila after puking your guts out you're hung up on someone who ripped your heart out. If you fall for a guy who hasn't been near love in ages give him a shake. Because his loving side may have sunk to the bottom. At least you won't regret not trying. Hey. Suppose we go to my place when you're done here. And I kiss better the sore parts of those tattoos one by one? And then... you show me the tattoos on parts of you I haven't seen and you say, look, it hurts here, too. Huh? -Do I have to answer now? -Do I take that as a yes? She's a fast mover, boss. Where did you find her? I didn't find her. She found us. "Fathers aren't always right." Duygu Okay, good night. FIG JAM "Fig Jam is nice." "You owe me breakfast." Duygu "Don't forget the song playing now." You said everything was going to be perfect. You said I had a long road ahead. Forget moving forward, my right leg no longer trusts the left, sweetheart. You left me stranded in the middle of life. Good morning, Mr. Metin. -Help yourself, Cemil. -I had breakfast earlier, Mr. Metin. More tea, Mr. Metin? No, I still have some. Okay, take a look. -There's a ton more e-mails, Mr. Metin. -Welcome to them. "Fig Jam is the best romance movie I've ever seen. Thanks." -Should I answer, Mr. Metin? -No. "Is it a true story?" Should I answer, Mr. Metin? No. "What kind of screenplay is that? You got us really upset." There's no answer to that anyway. More tea, Mr. Metin? Mr. Metin? Can we have a drink for the stage? You can. Breaking up with someone alive is the worst kind of break-up. If we aren't dead Breaking up is meaningless. Because if we aren't dead breaking up sucks. In that case, to the dead! So what? Rakı up to the wound. Don't send me cologne again. And be nice to the customers. They're our... Here we go. Good morning, everyone. Don't let him get to you. He's a sad sack. Be gentle with him. It's like this, dude. We've been together three months and only kissed. Show me a girl like that nowadays. Sure the problem isn't you, dude? My God! Check her out yourself. She'll soon be here. Look, she's pretty, honest, faithful, not a user. She had one relationship before me. It doesn't get better. Ready? Look. You had her face carved in your arm after knowing her three months? It's called love, my friend. Hey, baby! I'll introduce you. Aslı, Metin. -Glad to meet you. -Me too. My screenwriter friend. He wrote Fig Jam, remember? Right. Erol and I saw it together. Actually Erol cried a lot at the end. Baby. Show him. Very nice. Excuse me! Can we get the check? No single guys, fellows. Selami from Box Bar sends his greetings. Welcome. Let's have another bottle, gorgeous. Can I have a napkin, honey? I have question. Is that a wig? No. See what it says. The prick can't see straight. Our second bottle would be wasted. "My Desolate Heart". Come on, let's go. I'll trash the place otherwise. -Good night. -Good night, Metin. -Do you want to get soup, Gizem? -I'm too tired today. Okay. You owe me one then. You sing like my ass. You have a fit ass then. -Good night. -Good night. What the hell's going on? Move! Don't make trouble. Come with me. Fight. Breaking windows. Forced entry. There's some mistake, sir. You are where trouble is, girl. This time when I saw my boyfriend like that... Are you together? It's been three months. Fight. Breaking windows. Forced entry. -Is that it after everything tonight? -My eyebrow's bleeding. I'm not expected to take you home and dress your wounds, right? That only happens in the movies. Good night. They're asking your star sign. Should I answer? No. Your star sign? You sure get some crazy people. -Cemil, can I have more tea? -I just put more water on. "Are you thinking of writing Fig Jam 2'?" No, we're going straight for Part 3. People are seriously weird. -Should I answer, Mr. Metin? -No. Screw the e-mails. You need to get a grip on yourself fast. Look at you. Fights, alcohol. Get yourself a nice girl. Forget the past. -See how Aslı shaped me up? -Erol, do you never stop talking? If you're playing tonight, we'll come watch you. I'm not. I'll let you know. -Sure. Cemil, think the water's boiled? -Not yet. -Hey there, scout. -The gang's here. What's up? -Thought we'd check you out. -What are you drinking? -Beer. -Beer. -Are you splitting? -I can do a couple of drinks. Let's go then. -Good night, Timur. -Good night, Scout. An occupational habit, sorry. Are you following me? If I were, I'd have to sit with you, right? Enjoy. The six pack! Let's see it! Good morning. The coffee machine's under the stairs. There you go. Sorry. Keep it dry for two days. Remember to use the cream. -Hello. -How can I help you? I want to get a tattoo. Do you have a story? Exactly 40 years ago I met eyes with a girl at a bus stop. I'd just screwed up the courage to talk to her when the bus came. She got on and was gone. I checked my watch. From that day on I waited at the stop every day at the same time. The day I decided it was all over she came to the stop. Our eyes met again. This time I got on her bus. If you wait three months at the same stop for a total stranger whose voice you haven't even heard, I guess it's called love. You're the most sophisticated jerk I've ever met. Thank you. -Welcome. -Thanks. I want to get a tattoo. Or rather have mine changed. Changed how? I caught him in bed with the girl who tattooed our names for us. Please. When I can be bothered I'll start on these letters, Mr. Metin. Why labor over pages of letters when you have two-line e-mails? No, any day now. Thank you so much. -What can't you share? -Nothing, Metin. Cut the crap. Come on, admit it. You're betting on how much he'll drink tonight. -No, not this time. -What then? Whether Gizem will head butt anyone tonight. Goddamn sharks. We aren't racehorses. If Mr. Metin doesn't drink, I won't head butt anyone. But forget singing, he can't even say his name unless he drinks. -I say he'll drink! -I say she'll head butt! -I say he'll have seven glasses! -I say she'll head butt two people! I say he'll drink whatever. You're screwed. I say I won't drink. You waste your breath, Metin. Yes, kids. Mistakes will always come back to haunt you. Thank you. Do you want to grab some soup? Just as friends. It's stone cold. If your son, Umut, died of leukemia aged two You might not care a lot about how hot the soup is. HOPE I'll wash my hands. Do you have a cigarette, son? Thanks. Are you in love? -No, old man. -Work on it. Good luck. Great being taken for a spin, right? Now go get her. How about a drink or two? No way! We took money off the guys. -How would they know? -We would. Isn't that enough? Want a ride home? No. I've never even been in a car driven by a woman. Are you macho? -Don't say that. -Okay, have you ever seen a female serial head butter like me? We can even take a tour. Let's not overdo it. That bus ride was the only trip I've ever taken without knowing where I was going, how far and with who. On the bus was the greatest love of my life and the biggest regret. How much time do we have? No idea. But making a start is enough. Or rather finishing. I want at least to finish this properly even if it didn't start that way. -What happened when you got off the bus? -We got to know each other for six months. It was the best book I've ever read. As far as I know, no woman had ever asked a man to marry her until that day. -So did you say yes? -Yes. I had no money. I'd applied to work in Germany but was rejected. There were other ways. I planned to marry a German on paper Come back after making some money and marry the girl I loved. Good morning. Oh my God! What's up, Mr. Metin? Couldn't you sleep? I got up early today. Are you hungry? No, I already had breakfast, Mr. Metin. -The computer's on. -Really? -Turn it off if you don't need it. -I do. I'll just get a tea. How do we get rid of these ants? Don't kill them! -Welcome. -Thanks. I want to get a tattoo for my mother. Do you have a story? Yes. Meşrutiyet Ave. No 64/6 Beyoğlu What do you expect? Me to show up one day and say I'm back? You know it won't happen. You're my sweetest farewell. Look. Look at her eyes. She's looking at you the way I did. Buddy! Hey! We're busting a gut here to hook a fish. You get lucky and don't even reel it in. There's an etiquette to drinking rakı. First know who you're drinking with. Then who you're drinking to. Whatever you drink to must be worth it. Drink either to pleasure or to sorrow. Don't let anyone bad-mouth what's in the glass, Because it can be sensitive. And then drink to an absent friend who you wish was there. Come on. Good evening, Rıza. Please, Metin. It's past ten. Don't get me into trouble. Have you seen anyone turn teetotal after drinking until ten, Rıza? Have a good night. -Thanks. -Enjoy. So can you do a tattoo of that? No. It's just decoration. It would be great as a back tattoo. Hello. Welcome, Fikret. Can we do a session today? It's only been two days. You need a break in-between. -I have you down for Wednesday. -All right. -See you on Wednesday then. -Bye. HOW TO GET RID OF ANTS IN HOME I could've lived with a few of you but you overdid it, guys. Sorry. Greetings. How can I help you? We want to get a tattoo. What's your story? -Got a story? -No. -You? -Nope. In that case, we'll think about it and come back later. -Have a good day. -Goodbye. Just one thing. Can you do a Fenerbahçe tattoo? -No. -Have a good day. -Is that your goddamn story? -Yes, it was. -You were awesome again, dude. -Thanks. It's my first time hearing you. You're everything they said. Thank you. -Hi. Can I ask you something? -Sure. Didn't you also write the screenplay for Fig Jam? Yes. I'd love to drink with you one night. And get inside your head. -We'll see. -Thrilled to meet you. Have a great night. Alptekin is calling Yes, Dad? Screw that head of yours, dude. Just see what's around you and you're still grieving. I swear, if Aslı and I weren't serious... -Three months is serious. -Three months eight days dude. Anyway it's motive that matters. We had each other's tattoos done. That's a big deal. Gizem is a tattooist. -Where's your place? -Two streets down. So have you seen Aslı's tattoos? Show him, baby. NEVER FORGET THE ONE IN YOUR HEART Was it you who got the ring, dude? She has more on her back and her lower back. So you haven't seen the lower back one? Baby, Dad just called. We have to go. I have to drop Aslı home before 12. Let's go, baby. -Glad to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Sure. Don't be late. Good night. You like fish? Just as friends. Every evening as kids my brother and I used to watch out for dad. As soon as he was home We'd start yelling, dad, did you get prawns. -Was your dad a fisherman? -No, an interior designer. -Do you just have one brother? -Yes. -He's the high-flyer, a lawyer. -You? The problem child. The fine arts student with a question-mark future. You already have a job. Why work nights at the bar? I need to save. I want to move to Bodrum and open a tattoo studio. Why? The city's tiring. Every day is a battle. Want some prawn? -Thanks. -I did wash my hands. So who are you? No one for ages. My dad used to say he was scared of living like a plant, of being aimless, just to look green. I think you need to be someone. For someone at least. -When did you last touch a woman? -You can't ask that just as a friend. Don't always think with your dick. When did you last break through a woman's smile to her heart? Or when did you watch her fall asleep on your knee midway through a movie? Just curious. As a friend. Friends don't hurt with questions. Friends hurt most of all. Because they mean well. They hurt when they press the wound to stop it from bleeding. They don't hurt out of spite. They hurt so the wound will heal. What if it's a deep wound? Then friends are no help. The wound needs another heart. Because one wounded heart can only be relieved by another. So what's your story? He was a tattooist. One Wednesday he had a motorbike accident. On Thursday I was half a person. When you put one egg to boil you realize that two less one is one. When the dishes take no time. When the pot with your one coffee boils over in no time. You go through all kinds of shit and realize when your back gets dirty that the most unlikely detail matters. When you have to unlock the door with a cold key and the washing machine is never full, then you realize he's gone. Your side of the bed is warm for the first time since I became no one. -I feel like I'm cheating on Duygu. -Is that a joke? People cheat on their girlfriends, on their wives. They even con themselves that it's what they always wanted. You've spent two years being faithful to someone not alive. What would you want if you were Duygu? -For her to live her life. -What do you think she wants? I don't know. My head's a mess. Don't let it be. You're doing nothing wrong, dude. By the way, if you're doing okay for cash can you lend me 500 liras? I can't find the rent for the studio this month. -No problem. I have money, dude. -Thanks. -See you. -Good night. Good night, Metin. What are you running from? I know. You're running from today. From tomorrow. You're sunk in the past. You can't breathe without it. You're running from being left half a person again. We're already incomplete. How much less can we become? Carry on with your screaming silence! You run from anything good. You're full of self-pity. You run from anything alive and breathing. Want to hear a secret, man? You can't cheat on the dead! We lived within the boundaries drawn for us, lover. We had no real expectations. They taught us to love through touch. But it's not like that anymore. There's someone you can love regardless of time or place. Hug her in the street, kiss her on the corner. Let people see this love and take it as an example. Let them know how life-affirming it is. My heartsick sweetheart, love so strongly that they think it was worth all the suffering. Won't you be mad at me? I married a woman who'd been set up in Germany for me. My whole aim was to save some money and come back home. Until my wife on paper said she was in love with me. I couldn't live anywhere else. Otherwise someone would tell and I'd be deported. I lived with her. I spent two years trying to avoid sleeping with my wife. She had a drug habit. Metin. if you've quit your goddamn poison, just say so. -No, I still drink. -So it's us you want to f... Spite. -How can he have two drinks all night? -How do I know? I have a little money from heaven. Want to get a drink? If I choose where. A friend of mine had a birthday party here a year ago. I always wanted to come drink here. It'd be kind of lame to come alone. What are we drinking to? The most qualified drifter among us. It was built 1500 years ago as a lighthouse for sailors. Then someone else moved in and made a dungeon for captives. Prisoners threw themselves off into the depths. Someone else made a fire tower. The place went up in flames twice as a fire tower and still wasn't destroyed. Someone else made an observatory. As an earthquake alert it was damaged in two big tremors but wasn't destroyed. The roof flew off once in a storm. It witnessed five wars, was damaged 15 times and still wasn't destroyed. If you drink to anything else sitting here, just say and we'll drink to it. You can't cheat on the dead. -What are you drinking? -A beer for me. -You have Jack Daniel's? -Sure. Straight? With energy drink. Hey, dude, you could bring out an album. No, dude. I'm okay. The place is fine. -Your drink. -Thank you. Can you put more whisky in? -Where did get your tattoos done? -In Etiler. A guy called Big Cenk. -Do you know him? -Sure. He's a friend from college. The guy is truly huge, dude. If you say so, dude. To your happiness then. How long has Erol been with Aslı? Three months. -You don't like her, do you? -Do you? You aren't playing tonight. And it's my day off. So? So, you should take me out tonight. How is it? -Like my mother made it. -So you should definitely do it. You should tell me you fancy me and ask if I want to date you. -Why? For the toast? -No, for me. -So should I pick you up from home? -It would be great. But not my style. We'll meet where the action is. -What's up? A wedding, Mr. Metin? -Check the e-mails, Cemil. -Should I answer? -No. "I have a love story to blow your mind. I don't want money. Will you write the screenplay?" -Should I answer? -No. Did you expect someone else? Well, to be honest, yes. A crazy girl with a head butting habit. I know. She asked me to sub for her. I couldn't say no. Don't stop saying no to her, all right? Sorry, I stole your friend. Forget seeing her, I can't even call. Cell phones take away your freedom. Cell phones take away your freedom. Stop! What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay? -Hello? -Good morning. Is Metin home? -He's asleep. Who are you? -A friend from work. Come in. The second song's ending. He'll be up soon. -I don't understand. -Neither do I. Let me take your jacket. Fan mails? Yes. Like an e-mail wouldn't do. You come in. I'll get you some tea. Is that her? Yes. Welcome to my grave. Sorry about last night. -How's your friend? -My tango instructor. He's okay. He said he'd have been jealous if his girlfriend was nabbed like that. You hit him out of jealousy, right? It was me there, wasn't it? I'm an unlucky man. I'd have done anything to wipe the tears -of my beloved when she cried. -What happened to that woman? So much for my shortcut to make money and be with my beloved. I spent 20 years in jail. You don't look the type. Look in the mirror. Do you see the you before you fell in love? Go away. You're the only place and the only way I know. In the name of God! What breed is he? No idea. He was a stray. I found him lying by my bike one day. The way he looked at me was like let's go. We hung out for months without a leash. He'd come and go as he pleased. I prepared myself for him to leave one day. But he never did. -Anyone have any money, kids? -No. -We aren't into that any more. -Cool. And tomorrow's a big day. Gizem, can you give us nuts? What's tomorrow? Gizem's birthday. We bet on how much you'd drink tomorrow. Really? -Really. -Get out of here! -What's up, dude? -They're betting on how much I'll drink. -Baby, I'm off to the bathroom. -Want me to come, baby? -You can't be serious. -Okay. Adem, hold the fort a second. Knock it back. -No, I'm drinking beer. -Do it! Sorry. Knock it back. -Can I take a look at your ring? -Sure. Does it look good on me? Yes. Can I see your tattoos again? Show her, baby. And the one on your back, baby. Engin. -Alptekin. -What are you doing? -Onur. -What's going on? I was just wondering. Erol's a hard name to disguise. What are you going to do? -Change it to profiterole? -Loser! My ring! Dumbass. Metin, what's this about, dude? Gone with the wind, friend. How's it going, scout? Big Cenk. Metin. God, I've had enough. What's up? On the long side, are they? I never wrote that much to my dad back home, Mr. Metin. HAPPY BIRTHDAY SCOUT What did I do wrong? Where did I mess up? Duygu... ...died. Duygu died? Duygu died ages ago. It's just a fish that died. You dump someone who breathes for you and obsess over a dead fish? She was our fish. I know. I know, damn it and I hate to know. She got the fish. She put them in the tank. And she's gone! Please, I beg you, tell him you're dead. Tell him we're alive, that we're breathing. He only believes you, no one else. He treats us all like the dead. You know, you've seen it. Tell him I'm in love. It was my birthday today. I got dressed up just for you. I painted my nails thinking you might hold my hand. I put lipstick on thinking you might want to kiss me. And all you can say is Duygu died. For once you were honest with me, man. If there's such a thing as feeling, you fucked it tonight. Morning, Mr. Metin. You're awake finally. I wrote hundreds of letters. I never got an answer. Years later I found out that I'd poured out my heart to an empty flat in litigation. But all I'd wanted was to say, I've never forgotten you. Does drinking make it go away? No. It doesn't. It kills the pain. Kind of an anesthesia. You can't love when you're numb. Did you love her a lot? To love once is enough for what you mean. You're alone. See that crowd behind you, old man? Those people came to listen to me. Nicely put. That crowd. They came to have a good time. All they know is your name. -What else do you want? -True. We turn to crowds rather than value what we have. I'm alone, huh? You're alone, old man. Look at yourself before lecturing me. I have people interested in me, people who write to me, people who want to meet me. And you say I'm alone. -My head's swimming. -Sure, reading e-mails is easier. It's not a cop out. They're all from the same person. Who? Scout. I watched a movie one day. I saw your pain. I saw my pain on the screen. I was at your door day after day. I saw you leave home. I saw how you looked at people, how you walked. You were just like me. There was nowhere you needed to go. You didn't look at people's faces. You weren't looking for anyone. You weren't wearing a watch. Time didn't matter. You were going wherever like nobody. There was no one for you anyway where you were going. You were quiet wherever you went, just like me. You had nothing to say. Open your mouth and you'd curse. You looked at everyone like strangers. You think it was chance me getting a job at your bar? And dealing with a bunch of dipsos every night? You're right, I already had a job. What would I want at a bar? I wanted you. It was hard not to kiss your wounds outside the police station today. That hurt. But you'd have recognized me the moment I touched you. You'd have known I was wounded like you. When I called by this morning I saw my love piled up by the door. All unread. That's encouraged me to write more openly, man. You asked once why I call you man. They're a rarity, so when you find one, you should tell him so. When you looked at a dead fish today I gave up on you, man. We, the living, have nothing else to give you. This is my last letter. I came to you with my wounds dressed. You don't even know where your wounds are. I had everything in my pocket for you except goodbye. You snuck that in when I was asleep. Goodbye. If you fall for a guy who hasn't been near love in ages give him a shake. Because his loving side may have sunk to the bottom. At least you won't regret not trying. I tried. We forget that first encounter. Where we first kissed. The first time we held hands. What they were wearing when we first met. In short, we get used to love. But wasn't love what they wore the day we first saw them? The day we get used to it, we lose. Everyone has a story. Some etch their story on paper, others on their flesh. The story ends when the paper burns or the flesh is buried. You can be patient for 40 years but sometimes life begrudges you five seconds to say sorry. FOR RENT FROM OWNER WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO PLAY "BODRUM BODRUM" I want to move to Bodrum and open a tattoo studio. -The house is in your hands, Cemil. -Won't you come back, Mr. Metin? -I don't know. -Should I answer the e-mails? Yes. Good decision, Mr. Metin. You should follow your heart. -But don't screw up. Write proper answers. -All right. Shela? I have a story. Will you do the tattoo? Do you believe in it enough to get the tattoo done? I stand by every needle that sinks into my body. We have invisible wounds that can't be kissed better. Whether from a mother, a father or a lover. We have memories that hurt, that reduce us to a whisper. The person leaving or causing heartache doesn't have to die. We get wounded by somebody. We stick imaginary band-aids on our real wounds. We attribute all the pain of the past to the next heart. It's then that we lose. Every morning life begins again, we learn to breathe again. The most precious thing in life is the breath we take. If you fall for a guy who hasn't been near love in ages, give him a good shake. Because his loving side may have sunk to the bottom. Because life is too much to live alone. In the memory of Müslüm Gürses... "Is this a true story?" Yes.
