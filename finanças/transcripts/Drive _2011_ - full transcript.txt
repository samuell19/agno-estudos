No, I've been here for a while. You're just new here? Mmm-hmm. That's Benicio's father. Where is he? He's in prison. Oh. What do you do? I drive. Like a limo driver? No, like, for movies. Oh. You mean, all the car chases and stuff? Yeah. Is that dangerous? It's only part-time. Mostly I work at a garage. Where? Reseda Boulevard. I gotta go. Okay. Thanks for the water. Say bye.

What's the matter with you? I'm just... What happened to all the ashtrays in this town? (CHUCKLING) You run a perfectly good business. I don't know why you want to change now. You know how much my business made last year? Thirty grand. I can build a car in six months and in six seconds, these jerks write it off as a stunt that won't even make it into the movie. Mmm-hmm. See, all I need is a hard used stock car. That's all. And I figure we start off with small town circuit and we work our way up. And once we get to the show, we're talking millions. WAITER: I have the chopsticks, sir. Yeah. Where's the cookies? WAITER: Uh... You know, I... Forget it. Forget it. So, you still haven't given me a number. All right. $430,000. (EXCLAIMS) Mr. Rose, I wouldn't come to you with this unless I was absolutely sure about it. How can you be sure, Shannon? What do you got that the big professional race teams don't? I got the driver. You just told me they had half a dozen drivers. Not like this one. This kid is special. I've been working with him for a while. I've never seen anything like it. If I had the money, I'd back him myself. Yeah, but you don't have the money. Mr. Rose, you put this kid behind the wheel, there's nothing he can't do. There's money here. You can't lose. Fuck you eating chink food in my fucking restaurant? What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria? You remember Shannon. Take a fucking hike. I want to talk to my partner. I'm just fucking with you. How you doing, Shannon? How's the fucking leg? I paid my debt. I'll think about it. Okay? But I want to meet the kid first. That's all I ask. (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Come on, I want you to meet somebody. And whatever you do like about the car, don't say anything. I want to drive the price down a little bit. Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Rose. Nice to meet you. My hands are a little dirty. So are mine. (CHUCKLES) Good driving out there. Thanks. SHANNON: He's a good kid. So, what do you think? Do we get the 400? I'll give you 300 for 70%. Done. Right. Good. (LAUGHING) You won't be sorry. I'm Shannon. Hi. Irene. Irene. How can I help you? It just broke down. Just broke down. Just like that. IRENE: Mmm-hmm. You want me to take a look at it? IRENE: Yes, please. All right. Uh... We got all our bays full. Hey, pal. Just drop it down here. We'll push it in, all right? We want to push her into number three. The car, not you. Oh, good. (LAUGHS) Hi. Hi. You two know each other? Don't. Oh. Look at that. We're neighbors. Neighbors? Very good. Mmm-hmm. Well, we'll try to be neighborly too. You blinked. What? Can I call a cab from here? Yeah. Sure. What am I talking about? You and the kid are neighbors, right? He can take you home. Oh, no. I'd feel bad. No, no. Don't even think twice about it. He'd be happy to do it. He's a good guy. You know, he walked into my shop here about five or six years ago. Right out of the blue. Asking for a job. So I put him to the test to see what he could do. The kid's amazing. Yeah. So, I hire him on the spot. Boom. (SNAPS FINGERS) At about half the wages I normally pay. (LAUGHS) He didn't blink an eye. Hey, kid, come over here for a second, will you? And I have been exploiting him ever since. (LAUGHING) (SHUSHING) Don't tell him. Looks like we have a bigger problem than I thought. And we're going to have to keep the car here for a few days. So I offered your services to take Benicio and Irene home. That be okay? Yeah, sure. Yeah. I don't have wheels on my car. (LAUGHING) Okay. It's one thing you should know about me. Well, put the tires on. You got five minutes? Yeah. Hey, do you want to see something? Yeah. Okay.

Look at the tread on the tire's still good, huh? We're in business. We paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit? ROSE: I paid for it. Out of my own pocket. This is just the shell. It's the inside that counts, not the outside. Right, Shannon? SHANNON: You are correct, sir. Fuck that shit. I pay 300 for something, I want everybody to fucking see it. ROSE: Of course you do.

Hey, no false modesty. I got a lot of money in this. Did Shannon ever tell you how we met? No. I used to produce movies. In the '80s. Kind of like action films. Sexy stuff. One critic called them European. I thought they were shit. Anyway, he arranged all the cars for me. Did all the stunts. I liked him. I liked having him around. Even though he overcharged the shit out of me. His next business venture, he got involved with some of Nino's friends. They didn't go for the overcharging bit. They broke his pelvis. He's never had a lot of luck. The reason I'm telling you this is that he has a lot invested in you. And so do I. So anything you need, you call me. We're a team now. (LAUGHS) I'm excited. Nino, let's get the fuck out of here. (TV PLAYING) Is he a bad guy? Yeah. How can you tell? Because he's a shark. There's no good sharks? No. I mean, just look at him.

Tomorrow I don't know what the fuck It's going to be. What are you going to do? That's a really good question. They said they were going to come after Benicio and Irene next. You okay? You want something to drink? What is it you got there? Can I see? One of those men gave you that? Mmm-hmm. They told me not to lose it. You want me to keep that for you? Okay. (SIGHS) How's Benice? Good. You just saying that? No. What do you mean? I saw that Standard was in an accident. Yeah. What happened? He got beat up. Mmm-hmm. Just drunk kids. You should come over. You should come and see him. You want to... You want to hear a story? Do you want to hear how Mommy and me met? Yeah. Yeah? Okay. (IRENE CHUCKLING) STANDARD: We were at a party. And she was 19 years old. IRENE: Seventeen. You weren't 17. I was. Wow. So it was illegal? IRENE: Yeah. (BOTH CHUCKLING) (LAUGHING) All right. So I illegally walked over to a 17-year-old girl. And I walk up and I say, "Hello, Miss." "Watt is your name?" And she didn't say anything. And then I said... "Well, my name is Standard Gabriel." Then what did you say? I said... "Whrre is the deluxe version?" (LAUGHS) (STANDARD LAUGHS) STANDARD: She's good, man. Sharp. Oh, man. It killed me. (LAUGHS) And then a year later, you popped out, man. It was the best day of my life.

I don't sit in while you're running it down. I don't carry a gun. I drive. You look like you're hard to work with. Not if we understand each other. What's to understand? I can't do this thing alone.

Standard, take her with you and go get her a fucking coke! Okay, here's the deal. This much for Blanche, this much for that asshole, minus what he owes me, and this much for you. You still interested? Good. Anything else? When you get your money, his debt's paid. He's out for good. And you never go near his family again. You understand? STANDARD: I'm here with my family.

In related news, an attempted robbery turned tragic today when the owner of a local pawnshop opened fire on an intruder. The armed robber was pronounced dead at the scene. He has been identified as Standard Gabriel of Echo Park, Los Angeles. Other details are unclear, but the owner of the pawnshop told reporters that Gabriel acted alone and that no money had been stolen. In other news, four high school athletes were arrested... if he saw you take the money and he saw you get in the car, then why didn't he say anything? I have no idea. Did you have any idea there'd be a second car? I already told you everything. (MUFFLED SOBBING) Now, you just got a little boy's father killed. And you almost got us killed. And now you're lying to me. So, how about this? From now on, every word out of your mouth is the truth. (CRYING) Or I'm going to hurt you. Do you understand? Now what did Cook tell you? He said there'd be another car to hold us up, but he didn't say anything about all this money. He didn't say anything about anyone getting killed. You were going to rip us off? What's his real name? He says it's Chris, but I just call him Cook. You're going to take me to him right now. (BLANCHE WHIMPERS) Do you understand? Yes. (PHONE VIBRATING) (DOORKNOB RATTLING) (BANGING ON DOOR) (FOOTSTEPS) (GRUNTS) (THUD) (CELL PHONE RINGING) (CONTINUES RINGING) Easy. Easy. What did you do with the cash? 'Cause I could keep it safe for you... Will you just stop it? This guy Cook, does he have a real name? Chris. Maybe. I'll ask Bernie. See if he knows him. Jesus, I can't... I can't stop thinking about what we could do with all that dough. Will you just stop? All right. A lot of guys mess around with married women, but you're the only one I know who robs a joint just to pay back the husband. Crazy. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. (MUSIC PLAYING) Where's Cook? He's in the dressing room. Where's that? It's over there. (SCREAMING) (PANTING) Whose money do I have? Don't worry. They're going to come get it. No! No! Call them. Somebody call Nino! Do you remember this? (COOK COUGHING) (PHONE RINGING) MAN: Hello. Nino? No, sorry, pal. Why don't you call back later? We 're closed. I could, but I think Nino would be upset that you made him wait. Can I ask what this is about? I have something of his. And that would be? A million dollars. Please hold. NINO: You got something that fucking belongs to me? It seems that way. And you're calling me? You expect me to buy my own shit back from you? I'm not selling it. I'm going to give you a time and a place and you're going to come and get it. Do you understand? And what do you get out of it? Just that. Out of it. And your partners are happy with that? I don't have any partners. You discuss this with anybody else? No, just you. You're not very good at this, are you? (DRIVER HANGS UP) Go check out who this fucking guy is. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (IRENE EXHALING) Can I talk to you for a minute? Can't talk. I have to go. Can I just walk with you for a... Yeah. I have to tell you something. Standard was into some... (BREATHES DEEPLY) guys in prison for a lot of money. And they were going to hurt you and Benicio if he didn't pay it. He asked me for my help. Everything went wrong. I'm sorry. I still got the money. You can have it if you wanted to. You can take Benicio... I just thought you could get out of here if you wanted. I could come with you. I could look out for you. (ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS) Sorry. Wrong floor. (GRUNTING) They came to my apartment, Shannon. How'd they know where I live? I told you. I was going to call Bernie. I just wanted him to know that... That it wasn't about... That you're not interested in the money. That you just did it for the girl. (GASPS) I just... Why did you have to fucking tell them about Irene? Calm down! You told them about Irene! Calm down, kid. Just calm down. I should fucking kill you! You told them about Irene. I just wanted him to know that as soon as you returned the money, that was the end of it. That's all. I didn't know... How was I supposed to know? How was I supposed to know that? Okay? Look, let me just talk to Bernie. Okay. Why you got to fuck everything up, Shannon? How was I supposed to know everything led to Nino? They're gonna come looking for me. And they're going to come for you. Do you understand? You got to get out of here. And you got to get out now. Listen to me. Oh, God. Listen to me, Shannon. Listen. You get out of here and you never fucking come back. You never come back. What are you going to do? I already gave you my advice. You should have taken the money and left the guy alone. It's not that simple, Bernie. No, of course not. Now that it's bounced up in your face. COOK: Nino, I owe you this guy. Just give me a little time and I'll get rid of him. Shut the fuck up, you fucking monkey. The money belongs to some half-assed wise guy out of Philly. Now, I got tipped off, he was stashing a million bucks in a pawnshop. He was going to invest it here in LA. He was going to set up a rival operation. So you stole from the East Coast mob? No. I stole from some jumped-up punk who was trying to step on our action. Yeah? Then why didn't you come to me before you set up this dummy robbery? Before you hire this piece of shit. This is something off to the side, Bernie. I didn't want to involve you in this. Well, I'm involved now! I'm going to tell you something. Anybody... Anybody finds out you stole from the family, we're both dead. What fucking family? The family who still calls me a fucking kike! To my face! Yeah, I'm 59 years old, Bernie. They still pinch my cheek like I'm some fucking kid. Family. The money always flows up, Izzy. You know that. (NINO SIGHS) That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie. He's gotta go. And your pal, Shannon. These are the only two guys who can tie me to this robbery. (COOK SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) Now it's your turn to clean up after me. All these priceless cars. One would think you'd have better locks. Why? Door's always open to you. Going somewhere? Uh... (LAUGHS) Thinking about it. I'm looking for your driver. You break in here, I figure it's bad news. No, Shannon. It's bad luck. 2,000 heists a year in this city, he has to pick the wrong one. He tried to put it right. Well, he picked the wrong guy for that, too. My partner is a belligerent asshole with his back against the wall. Right now, so am I. If I don't set this straight, I'm in big trouble. Any idea where he might be? Mexico. Or maybe it was Belize. Really? I was getting excited about this whole thing. My name on a carl I mean, look how beautiful. I wanted to see my name on this thing. I think we would have made a go at this business. (GASPS) Don't worry. Don't worry. That's it. It's done. There's no pain. It's over. It's over.

Tomorrow. There's a place on Sherman Way, it's a restaurant called The Great Wall. Do you know it? DRIVER: Can I talk to you? I won't keep you long. I have to go somewhere and I don't think I can come back. But I just want you to know. Getting to be around you and Benicio was the best thing that ever happened to me. Did you bring the money? Here's what I'm prepared to offer. You give me the money, the girl is safe. Forever. Nobody knows about her. She's off the map. I can't offer you the same. So, this is what I would suggest. We conclude our deal. We'll shake hands. You start the rest of your life. Any dreams you have, or plans, or hopes for your future... I think you're going to have to put that on hold.
