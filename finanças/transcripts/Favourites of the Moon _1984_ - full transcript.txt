FAVOURITES OF THE MOON Hey, that's a flat. Look. Oh shit! - It's me. - Gently. Since the dawn of humankind, hunt has linked man to nature. It's pleasant to rise early, to walk in the dew, to breathe the perfume of the woods and the meadows, of the countryside... And the blue sky. Writing's easier than talking. It's often easiest not to talk at all. Lest one say something stupid. Or reveal the truth. To say and to talk aren't alike. Then let's simply talk. We've not much time for that. Well then, write to me. Well done! You're ruthless to me. - It's taking shape. - Come on... You're flattering us. Not too fast. "Let not us that are squires of the night's body, "be called thieves of the day's beauty; "let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, "minions of the moon." Thank you. Good morning, Madam. Thank you. Ten thousand. Five hundred. Twelve thousand. Five hundred. Thirteen thousand. Five hundred. Nineteen thousand? Sold at nineteen thousand. Now we come to lot 29. An exceptional Sevres porcelain service with polychrome design, dated 1781. We start at 20 thousand for the service. 20 thousand francs. Does that appeal to anyone? 20,000. Do I hear more? Sold at 20 thousand, this Sevres porcelain service. Thank you. Here's your slip. Be careful. - Sod your coffee. - It'll get cold. Here. - What now? - You need this. Drink your coffee. You've got time... - To hell with that coffee. - Every day... All right, every day. So what? - Why do you always dash? - Why? No kiss? Hi, girls. I'm sorry. My respects, charming lady. It's your lucky day. Coming? Gladly. Isn't it beautiful weather, ladies? - These stairs... - Come on, just a bit more. All my life going up and down these stairs. - Hello. How are you? - Fine. Come in, darling. Make yourself comfortable. The van. See you tonight. Hi, honey. How are you? Are you sulking? Yes, you're sulking. He was just and old friend from school, nothing more. Nothing happened. We went home to have a drink when you arrived. Why get mad about that? - A drink? - A drink, that's all. A friend can't touch my shoulder... I don't believe a word. What? You don't believe a word? That's ridiculous. I should have invited you to join us. You're right. What's that thing? I can't believe that gadget. You whore! You slut! - Stop it. - I don't want to see you again. - You're despicable! - You've lost it! Let go of me! You pig! You'll pay for that. - He's mad today! - Bastard! Bitch! Good, they've been repaired. All right, perfect. - Here. - Thank you. Chief! Get yourself something better. - How's business? - All right. - Working the neighbours? - So what? You jealous? - When then? - I'll call. Here, quick. You left me alone with that old hag. Stop bugging me. I'm sorry. - Here I am. - Two hours waiting. Sorry, it wasn't my fault. - How about some lotion? - And a massage. I envy you. Believe me. Let's try a new nail colour today, shall we? All right, go ahead. Superintendent... Chief. The man's not been identified. Not conclusive. Please, don't touch me! Look at this... Here's the device. This is the timer, goes up to 45 minutes. Memory. You set the memory here. The detonator and the instant explosion detonator. You mustn't touch that. The timing is here. This sets off the timing. This detonates it immediately. Be careful. He mustn't touch the red button. What's he doing? Throw it! It's going to go off. I'll buy it. You promised they'd do no tests with living beings. Sit down. Now I'm telling you... What I really hate... Shit! I really hate that. Like, for instance, begging with a pet. I didn't want to see myself going: "Can you spare some change, please?" Instead, I'd ask my mates: "Can you help me out? I'll pay you back when this is over." Because I don't want to beg, I can't do it. I don't often do this. I'm flattered. Keep the change, thank you. - What shall we do? - Lovely. Let's take a walk. You haven't asked my name! I'm bashful, out of my depth. - Not a while ago. - That was then. Be brave. I'm with you. - Here. - No, that money stinks! Listen to you. You're the stupidest person I know. Drop me off here. Pull up. Say something. I hate silence. Talking is easy. It may be easier not to talk. One might say something stupid or tell the truth. To say and to talk aren't alike. Let's simply talk. For that, we have very little time. I'm really not after something that's too complicated. I need something simple and efficient. I don't need it to blow up a building. Just an object that's two metres high. Made of stones about this big. You see? I think you know what I need. - I have this. - What the heck is that? A bit sophisticated. Complicated, but efficient... No. I can't even use a tin opener. In that case, you may want something I've just made. Rather old-fashioned. Good, that's exactly what I like. The detonator goes here. See this hole? Put a fuse in there. What's it again? Since the dawn of humankind... hunt has linked man to nature. It's healthy to rise early... And to walk in the dew. No. To walk in the dew. It's healthy, it's pleasant to rise early and to walk in the dew. Wrong. Start over. Come here, you. Start over. Since the dawn of humankind... Since the dawn... They may talk about the theatre instead of country life. No, they always talk about hunting, never about the theatre. Now once again. Since the dawn... What's going on here? What are you doing? Come on, that's enough. Everyone outside. To think that for your health... - Come on, that's just a pretext. - He's right. Please... He likes the country. I understand that, but one can love nature differently. Since the dawn of humankind, hunt has linked man to nature. That's right! It's pleasant... It's always existed. To rise early, to walk on the dew... - Nice. - To breathe the perfume of... Try it instead of ranting about those poor little animals... Besides, for your health, farm produce is much better. It's absurd to expound such ideas, my dear old friend. Be nice to our charming guest. Very charming indeed... There should be a law allowing people to hunt hunters. What do you eat, after all? I'm trying to say I'm a vegetarian, as you may have noticed. Excuse me. You think you can fix them with glue? - Listen, Madam... - You listen! - The children... - I know the children. - Shut up! - Why do you shout? - Back to work. - No, thank you! Here you are. A calvados, please. Make it a double. How's it going? Usual thing? Look what you've just done. I'm sorry. My friend, you better go get some air. I think you should leave. I'm knackered, my love. - Don't touch me. - What's wrong? Why "Don't touch me"? We're rich, honey. - Plus, you're drunk. - Kiss me. Get off me! I'm sick of this. You stink of booze. Look at you, you're disgusting. You think I like... - Good evening. - Hello. - How are you? - Good. - Feeling better? - Yes, thanks. What have you done? I've never seen her in that state. You're in no state to ride that. He'll kill himself. What's got into him? Jesus... Sit down, please. It's not so bad. Although I'm afraid it's been used a few times. It's old, but rebuilt like new. Crude, but should work. It should work, but we can never be sure. We're never totally sure. Hide it. Hide it. Hello. How are you? You're not alone? I invited a couple of friends over. They're charming people. My daughter. M. Jim, M. Daniel. How do you do? Carry on... Thank you. You know... You're having problems. Nothing really tragic... How sad... I can't eat in these circumstances. Totally lose my appetite. Ignore them. - It's your fault. - My fault? Hunting, nature, vegetarians, idiots... Who wanted to socialise? It was your idea to go out. Amateur burglars. Amateurs? They stole everything. Shut up. Don't piss me off. My ring? I work my life away for this! - Seen it all? - Not your bedroom. Go look. Let's run over it again. Solid silver cutlery, a sable coat, a pearl necklace, diamond-studded gold bracelets, three brooches - two gold, one platinum - a diamond ring... Goodbye. I forgot that. Thanks. - Don't I get anything? - Next time. Thanks. See you. You can't imagine how good it is. Gets you wasted. You get completely wasted. Get a heavy wine, about 14% or 15% alcohol. Mix it with eggs. Allow two eggs per person. A large glass of Marsala wine, from Sicily. Then you beat it all... The eggs, both yolks and whites? The yolks only. Throw the whites away. Two eighty. Silence! We'll sing "La Route de Dijon". You know it, so do your best. One... No, excuse me. One, two, three. I'll set the pitch. All together at three. What have you got now? Cute plates. Try to fix them. That's pretty. They're all broken. - We'll try to glue them? - I'm not sure. All right. Keep it for me. Wait, I've got to talk to you. Listen to me... - Look at my head. - Typical. Who's that guy? None of your business. Leave me alone. Listen, Claire. Leave me alone, you hear me? Thank you very much. Goodbye. He buys your food and your clothes. That's something. You like it, sir? I feed him! In bed he's an animal. That can be cured, you know? Can I solve your problems? No, that's impossible. Too bad. Finished. Do you like it? Yes, very good. There's always someone to fall back on. Don't you like him? - I don't care about names. - Too pricey. - Give me obscure ones. - Great investment. Quality is what I want. It's not signed, but it's good. - How much? - Ten thousand. Fine. Cash payment as usual? I prefer. I'm in trouble. Where will I put them all? - Did I hurt you? - Not at all. Excuse me. Close it now. Screw the lid on. Quick, the fuse. Put it down. Now the fuses. Give me one that works. I'll install it myself. That one works. How kind of you to invite me. Let's taste the melon. Here. One, two. Go ahead. Hello... How very kind. Thank you. What did the little one get today? A wallet, two credit cards. You threw the wallet away? Are you mad? It's crocodile. You'd better not be caught with it. What else? What else? A watch on the bus. Snatching watches is risky. Tell me, dear. Who's educating the brat? That's what I think. You don't get it. It's my welfare she's concerned about. Of course it is. Here. I'll go there. Hi there, lovebirds. Mind me sitting here? Nice little tits. A rare thing these days. Stay here, lovebirds Bourgeois idiots! So temperamental. Cordon off the park. Get a man at each gate. Search the bushes. Give me a hand. Do you love me? - Do you love me? - Of course. Are you working now? Here. What is it, honey? You still love me, right? I was just thinking of you. Sorry, I've an important meeting. Gentlemen, it's over. - I'll call you. - Me too. He's the one. That way. You go that way. Hurry up. Yes, please. Cut me a thin slice, I've no teeth. Very thin. - What? - Very thin. - You slept? - Outside. I was lucky, no rain. Weren't you cold? I was all right I had a blanket. The cops didn't bug me... What do you want? What's the matter? I'm clean. Leave me alone! Bastards! I'm not here, OK? - All right, Dad. - Hurry. What is it? Open up. What's going on? It's me. I'll explain. Stand aside. Over here. Clear the area, come on. Police. Open up. What now? Open up! I'm coming. Open up! - What do you want? - Don't move. Do as you please. Search the whole place. Be my guests. What are you doing here? - Answer me? - I don't know. - You don't know? - No, sir. Get dressed. - Get up. - You're there? - Search him. - I have nothing. - Come out. - I'm coming. I can't believe this! Let me go! Let him go! Good gracious... What could he have done, at his age? These days they arrest anyone. Honest people get put away and the scum walk. What the hell! Thank you. See you next Saturday. Thank you very much! - I'm through with this. - Swine! - Bitch! - How dare you? - Bug off! - You scumbag! Your patience will be rewarded. The usual thing? Electronic locks, a safe and infallible system. That's it. - At your service. - Very well. Thank you. Look at the state you're in. Look at you. You're a pig! - A pig! - Say that again. Come on, I'm sick of this. Stop it now. That's enough. Dirty cop! Bastard! Your mother's so cool. Wicked! Poor Dad. He'll be all bruised up. She can fend for herself. This show's stupid. I prefer the cinema. - I like crying. - I prefer laughing. So do I. - Hello, children. - Hello. Give me a light, please. - Where you going? - My own business, sweetie. Bye. Goodbye, Mum. Goodbye. I want to talk to you. Where's my father? Stop! Mrs. "Yoko Yoyotte. Your chair. Excuse me. Yes, obviously. Yes, go ahead. Thank you. See you soon. - I'll call you. - All right. Gentleman, please tell me what you were doing with that woman. What were you doing with her? Answer me! OPEN CLOSED I don't often do this. Liar. Where are we going? I don't know. We'll see.

If you please, Madam, could you sign here? Accept my gratitude and apologies. Goodbye, Madam. Give me that. No smoking here. - I don't care. - Come along. - I want to smoke. - We've warned you twice now. You don't care about my musical culture? You bastards. When I feel moved, I need to smoke. It's only human. You don't have to go to school to do this filthy job. You're all scumbags! Fine, I'll go on singing. Have my seat. Thank you.
