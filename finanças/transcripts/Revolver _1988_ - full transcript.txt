Ouch... - Race 6, No.'s 4 and 2 - Same for me. 4 and 2 for the Quinella. lt's 4 and 2 for this race's Quinella, paying 1,730 per bet. - Alright, here's 289,000. Nice job. - Yes. Did you bet a lot? l bought 10 tickets. That's more than me. l'll treat you today. l touched your hand while placing my bet. You might have brought me good luck. Me too. l haven't lost since l met you. Good, let's go then. Why do you like bicycle races? l like the sound. The eyes can't see, the hands can't touch... and the sound of wind is so relaxing. What about you? Only in bicycling and boxing do you gamble on the people. Attention all passengers, the train will end at the next stop. Your first time visiting Kagoshima? Because there's no bicycle races. REVOLVER He's a bit strange. Didn't even take the promotional exam. He says he wants a simple life, so l hope Miss Ayo can restore his fighting spirit. Right. lf he has a family, he'll forget his simple life and work harder. His boss has served in the force since high school. But Shimizu's a university graduate. lf he doesn't rise the ranks, it'll be a shame. Wasn't he rewarded by the commissioner? He was specially chosen last year for the internal promotion exam. But he opted out. Said he's happy the way he is. Fortunately, his boss likes him and promoted him anyway. Do you like police officers? Yes! Why? A civil servant's life is steady. Once you're married, you get housing, too. There's security. Shimizu, why did you become an officer? l'm fascinated by weapons. This job allows me to handle guns. l was either going to be a cop, soldier, or yakuza. My ambition is to be free. l want to travel the world and be free. lzumi! Say, are you going to the beach this week? l've decided to pass this year. You won't fail the exam just because you go. lt's only a one year sacrifice. l wish it were just a year. - Are you angry? - You go ahead. What a temper. What are you doing here anyway? l'm working part time, but l'm resting right now. That one's amazing. Let's pick her up! No, not me. Arata, let me ask you something. - How many bars are there in this place? - About 10. How many pretty chicks? About the same. How many easy targets? Do you mean you or me? You should know that yourself. l'm like you. l have nobody. l wouldn't have come here if l'd known... No, it's okay. My skin isn't good. That's all. l burn easily. Too much sun gives me wrinkles... and skin cancer. Do you like kids? l can't say l don't. l'm glad! How many kids do you want? l've never thought about it. lzumi! We're at the beach so stop studying! Put the book away! Can you help us? Excuse me, can you take a picture for us? Thanks. Chief, maybe they're not coming. No, they said they'd be here. Just wait. Can you put some sunscreen on my back? Sure. l forgot the sunscreen. l'll go buy some. Too much sun and we'll get a cold during the winter. That's what grandmother says. We don't want that to happen during such an important time. lzumi, do you like girls? Not really. You ever thought about it? lzumi. Are you like other boys? What? Do you jerk off? Chief, they're still not here. Are they really coming? l'm sorry, l got the wrong man! Why do you think this is? What are you talking about? Always getting cheated by those bar girls. To tell the truth, l've never been stood up. Emiko got an urgent call, so she had to go... lt's two o'clock, what could it be? l think people are getting the wrong idea. They might think you and l are gay. But we're rich and single. We don't have to work and we have time to travel. We should be great catches. We're misunderstood. Never mind, just let it go. ldiot. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. Looks like it's gonna rain! - Hurry and get your clothes in! - Yes! Thanks. - Say, would you like some watermelon? - Sure, l'll be right over. Sorry to bother you. l hope it won't rain. Just help yourself. There's more in the fridge. Great. Looks delicious! Telephone! Can you answer it? Yes? No, l'm her neighbor. Who is this? Sapporo? lt's lshimori from Sapporo. l'm not here. Hello? l'm sorry, but Miki's out. Yes, okay. Okay, l'll tell her. He says he's coming to Kagoshima. Who is he? l met him in Hokkaido. Did you sleep with him? You think l did? ls he really coming here? Turn the light on. l can't find my pants. l'm getting married. Stop kidding. lt's true. With Hiroshi from the Sales Department. You're going out with him? Only a few times. We went for drinks and sometimes dinner. And you're marrying him? He proposed to me. What about me? Will you marry me? l said l'd marry you. You weren't serious... and l can't wait forever. l won't leave you! We've already decided on the wedding date. l'll tell everyone about us... and then you'll have to marry me. And you'll be demoted. Misato, you're right. Please don't leave me! What would l do without you? You can't leave me. What about me?! Have you thought about me? Don't forget. To come to the wedding. - Umm... l'm sorry about the other day. - lt's okay. l was really stupid. l felt up a cop. lt's unbelievable. Well, l was shirtless. Would you arrest a female lecher? lf l were the victim and you were the perpetrator, l wouldn't. Your wife must have been very angry. Was everything alright? That wasn't my wife. Umm... do you like to drink? l don't dislike it. Alright. l'll give you a discount if you come. You have to come, but don't wear a uniform. So she works in a bar... Setsuko. Thank you. He's a dumb asshole, that goddamn Nakamura! Listen. lf he thinks a double siege will win, then he's making a goddamn mistake. Got it? What do you think? They'll need backup. They'll go for it. Did you hear them say 1331? That may be an inside slip. Watch it! He's crazy. We'll win for sure now. Guaranteed. - Huh? - Because somebody ran into you. 5 tickets, No.2! No.1 as well! Thanks. Draw your gun! Empty the bullets! - Shimizu Nobuhiko, No. 112. - Right. - Emi Jun, No. 116. - Right. - Hello, Shimizu! - Yes. Seeing any girls lately? Yes. Now you'd better get your ass in gear. Or you may lose your chance. That's all. l'm leaving now. You'd better think twice, or you may regret it. Let me do it. So, how about dinner after work? What about your girlfriend? That wasn't my girlfriend. Miki, come here. ls he your friend? Get rid of him... he has a bad attitude. You're here at last. Get away. Let's drink. Let's drink. You've had a lot, you should go home. l've no home to go to. Then go to a hotel. No money. Come on, let me go to your place. l live with a friend. She answered your phone call. Then let's go to a hotel. No. Forget it, just lend me some money then. - Did you come here just for that? - Of course not. lf you have no money, why did you come all the way from Hokkaido? Stop babbling. No! Stop! Well? How's that feel? Good, huh? Please! Please! Well? lsn't that good? We did it four times in a row in Sapporo. You even left me your number. After l came, how could you treat me this way?! l want some traveling money. You saw it? Have you been here the whole time? Damn pervert! Are you okay? Are you alright? l'm sorry l dragged you into this. You're bleeding a lot! l can take you to the hospital. You okay? Are you a student? Now the couple will cut the wedding cake! Great. Just like a pro. Where can l throw them away? Here. Sorry. Thank you. Don't worry. When can we meet again? Sir, it's time to go on patrol. Right. l must get to work. l'll be about an hour. See you soon. l'm not what you think l am. You can't rely on me for any future plans. Shimizu, don't look down on yourself. l think you're too modest. You got a medal of valor from the commissioner. l wasn't training, but l had my boots on. His was messy, unshaven... and he was walking in the middle of the street at 3 a.m. But l didn't treat him like a vagrant. When he saw me approaching, he asked me if l had any food, so l brought him back to the station. l was shocked to find out who he was. That's all. Apart from luck, one needs ability. Honestly, l'm not the perfect man you think. No, l like men like you! You're just looking for any husband. lt doesn't matter who he is, so long as he marries you. You're wrong! l want you! You're the only one l want to marry, Shimizu. lt's true! Believe me. l don't want marriage, but l crave sex. l'm that kind of man. You're too much! Are you two always together? Haven't you married yet? Why do you ask? Have you? Sure. Any kids? How are your wife and kids doing? What? You two are together all the time, yet you don't know? - Because l don't have any. - No, because l never ask. So, why are you alone now? Because she dumped me. What's she like? Not tall, but has a long neck. Big eyes and fair skin. That sounds like Emiko. We have to check out your wedding night! Come on, stop playing. We all love you, y'know. l'm heartbroken you married someone else. Damn drunks shouting all the time... There seems to be more cops around. Something's up. - Hey, boss! What are you doing? lt's late. - You're here to check out the bride, too? - Boss, come and have a drink with us. - Come on and join us! Go ahead. Don't do that... l have to get up early tomorrow, okay? l want it tomorrow and l want it today. Misato, l love you. l love you, too. Passengers, please board the flight now. The man who attacked you approached you, but you didn't notice him? Yes. That's hard to believe! Ordinarily, you'd able to see the man, unless if you're asleep. You're right, and he was on duty, too. He got his baton taken as well! Hello, Akune residence, who is it? Daddy, is that you daddy? Daddy, please come home! Have you been kidnapped? Tell me! Masami. When giraffes eat food in high places, they extend their necks? Really? l'm asking you. Arata, how did you make a living before? l worked part time and bet on races... just like you. When l have money l don't work. When the money's gone l do some work. - You're really a college graduate? - Yeah. Why don't you find a regular job? Mister, watch where you're going! What do you want? l'm in a hurry. lf l don't deliver this l won't get paid. Give me the pizza. Give me the pizza. Mister, stop joking. That's a toy gun, isn't it? - You can get a pizza anywhere! - Give me it or l'll shoot! Are you crazy?! You can't work with your fiancee around. She's not my fiancee. So what were you doing... with a woman in the park? Were you looking for peeping toms? So you did something to attract them? We were just having a chat. Yes? l'm sorry. Did you find the gun? We found an armed man. l'll go with you! No. You'd better stay here and pray there aren't any victims. Welcome to the zoo. Attention everybody, to avoid danger, please don't feed the animals. Thank you. l should go back. Well, does it taste good? Delicious. You don't seem to want it. What's up? You look worried. What happened? You're not listening to what l'm saying, are you? You're not paying attention. l wanna go back. Why? You think this is a waste of time? What's going on? Are you going back to study? lt's my stomach. Something wrong with the food? No, l'm going. You're too much! l hope you have diarrhea! Stop! Check her out, what a figure! Must still be in high school. l don't care, she's pretty. Yeah, she is. Probably experienced, too. She's only a high school student. They're very open these days. Yeah, guess you're right. What's that? What's what? Attention, everybody. An armed man has been seen in the area. The police are conducting a search. Please stay calm. ln time, everything will be alright. No matter what it is, just give it time... What? Have they caught the man? l hope so. Now it's just the missing gun. Welcome. Are you Officer Shimizu? The gun that the armed robber's using... is it yours? So it is. Can you tell me how you lost it? ln detail, please. - What would you like to drink? - Brandy on the rocks. You got an award last year. ls that your resignation? You were awarded for your good work... - And now you lost your gun. - l'm trying to have a drink! - Do you mind shutting up? - The whole town knows about it now. So what's the big deal? A loaded gun's still missing. l pray everyday that nobody uses it. ls that all? You lost your gun. You think by resigning it'll clear you of responsibility? My gun was stolen. Yes, l'm responsible. But finding the missing gun... is the job of all police officers. You're running away from your duty. Here's a towel. One man can't do much. Stop running away. You're useless. What if your gun kills somebody?! Fool! Stop! Stop fighting! Stop fighting! PIZZA DELIVERY MAN ROBBED USING POLICEMAN'S GUN BIKER GOES FOR A DIVE AFTER ESCAPE PIZZA ROBBERY - PUBLIC ANGERED OVER CONCEALED POLICE PISTOL THEFT THE WORLD'S WEAPONS Magnum M60, double action, a 3.8, 198 mm in length. 77 mm muzzle and super-sized rubber grip. What's ''double action''? ls that girl new? You mean Setsuko? She started yesterday. She dresses nicely. But her figure's better! She's got a tiny waist. - That's an illusion. - Really? Come here. Let me tell you something. What is it? - lt's about her. - Does she wear see through panties? ldiot. Pervert. So what is it? She's seeing a cop. - So what? - You mean that cop? Yeah, that's him. He had a fight in her bar. So she was fired. That's why she came here. That's not all. l heard his gun was stolen. What are you talking about? We're talking about your new boyfriend. Stop playing. lf someone's really taken the gun and hasn't returned it... it's because they intend to use it. Even if he doesn't, he wants to pose with it. Like us pressing buttons or pulling rings when we see them. Like spending money when we have it and drinking when we see a beer, or smoking when we see a cigarette, Or when l light a cigarette when l see a match. lt's you, the student. What do you want? Tell me where that man lives. Stop it. You want to go to Hokkaido to get bashed? So he lives in Hokkaido? What street? What number? Stop worrying about yakuza and just study hard. After what he did to you in the park, don't you hate him? l want to kill him. l want to kill him, too. Since he's resigned, he should vacate his apartment. But his stuff is still here. Shimizu... where could he be? Thank you. What's up? l need a favor. l need money. Why? l want to take a trip. You said you had exams this year and couldn't even stay at the beach. What's going on? Just lend me the money and l'll tell you. What if l say no? You're the only one l can come to for help. But look... l only have about 100,000 yen. Turn off the toaster. - Let's go to a cafe for breakfast. - lt's late. l want mayonnaise, then. You want mayonnaise? l can't eat toast without it. That's probably the reason... - why your wife left you. - Any coffee? l'm grinding the beans now. Breakfast is soda with bread? lt's no longer morning. l haven't noticed. Frank Shorter extracted the carbon from the drink. Who's he? A marathon runner. - The guy who went for a crap on the run? - That's him. - Now... how much have we got? - Exactly 3 million. So... shall we split it? 1.5 million each? Sure, how are you gonna use it? We made some money and spent it together. l want to be on my own for a change. And how are you gonna spend yours? You'll laugh if l tell you. You're gonna spend it on Emiko, aren't you? l'll buy her lavender... it's a flower. 1.5 million yen for a flower? lt's from a very far away place. Very far away? There's a lavender farm in Hokkaido. Are you going there with her? No way, it's her birthday present. So you asked Emiko what she wanted and she said lavender? Emiko... said she wanted a lavender farm. Were you drunk? And now you want to keep the promise? There's a race tomorrow. We should decide what to do now. We'll do both. You should take this train. Tell the truth or l won't go. Forget it, l won't ask anymore. Now l know you don't trust me. l don't mean that. - l'm off, Setsuko. Thanks. - See you. - Bye. - See you. So, where's your boyfriend? He's probably asleep or drunk. He never goes out the house. He doesn't shave and he doesn't talk to me, either. Let's get a drink. l want to talk to you. lt might help him as well. l'm not lying. He beat me bad. l even lost some teeth. He kept kicking me when l was down. My face was all messed up. Damn him! l can't let him off! l'll make him pay! Bastard. He lives in Sapporo, that's why l'm going there to get revenge. lzumi, don't you think this is silly? - Don't fight with guys like that, it's not worth it. - l didn't fight! l did nothing! He hit me! Why would he if you did nothing? That's ridiculous. Maybe he's mad or something. Just leave it to the police. l think he's a local tough guy. Just a bully. Probably got kicked out of school and couldn't find a job. He lives by picking on the weak. Then you should keep away from him. People who use violence on others will get their payback one day. l want him to know he's wrong and make him sorry for what he did! What he did was pitiful. People like him shouldn't be allowed to live! What are you talking about, lzumi? l don't get you. l don't get you at all. Women don't understand this. Give me back my money. l told you everything. Stop thinking about revenge when you're so angry. You'll get beaten up again. Come on, just forget the whole thing. l must go to Hokkaido... no matter what. ldiot! Then just go and get beat up! Let him knock off all your teeth! Then break your arms and legs and have you beg for your life! You're smart but you can't win all the time. What makes you think you're better? You're so naive. This world... isn't perfect. A pistol? Where did you get that? What are you doing? Will you shoot? A bookworm like you can't shoot. Show me. Do it, shoot. Come on... why do you keep aiming it at me? You fired at me. You fired at me. Go away! Shimizu. We shouldn't change our plan. We should go by plane. l did it for you. What's the purpose of this journey? Lavender. But l have a feeling we'll have bad luck, just like today's race. l hope your hunches aren't like yesterday's. Hachiya, are you always wrong about your hunches? Due to pollution at sea, the number of marine animals have declined. We must look after our environment to save nature from pollution. What should l wear? Well, this will do. There's fish in the fridge, OK? l'm going now. Did you forget something? l've been looking for you. lt's about that incident. Why can't you just leave me alone? Shimizu, l thought you quit the force because you wanted to find the gun. lnstead, you're hiding here. l got a call last night. They heard a gunshot. - Where?! - The fish market. l took the call. The caller didn't sound drunk to me. Something must have happened. - lf you have any honor, then you must do something! - You're overestimating me. You might be right. Bye. A woman's waiting for you in your flat. She says your stuff is still there and you can go back for it anytime. Why did you become a cop? Was it your parents' idea? Attention all passengers. This train will be leaving soon. Attention all passengers. This train will be leaving soon. Hachiya! Attention all passengers. This train will be leaving soon. l told you we had no time to eat. But you said train food's terrible. - l also said we could get lunchboxes. - l don't like cold rice. But we only had spaghetti. lt's a spaghetti restaurant, what do you expect? l don't like spaghetti. You don't? But you hate everything. l don't like to leave food. This is it. No. 9 and No. 10. Which one do you want? l don't care. Either will do. Got a smoke? l'm sorry, do you mind? Please don't smoke here. l'm allergic. l can't stand it. l'm back! How's everything? A news reporter was here. He said the gun's been used. So what? What can you do about it? l should do something. l was afraid of this so l didn't tell you. What? Someone knows who took it. Really? Who? A girl who lives next to Mayumi. You mean the girl at the bar? The Silver Chariot. No! l promised l wouldn't go the police. Then why did you tell me? You're no longer a cop. But l have to tell them. She might get in trouble. Why don't you try talking to her first? Come on! You're tired all the time! That's right. Arata... are you asleep? What? l can't sleep. Let's get a drink. lt's four o'clock, the dining car's closed. We should have gone by plane. We'd be at the Sapporo Hotel by now. Got a smoke? - Arata. - Yeah? Go to sleep. Miss, can l ask you something?! What is it? lt's about my stolen gun! He's just a boy. A boy? A high school kid. A kid took it? Does he still have it? Maybe, l'm not sure. Why did he take it? He said he wanted to kill him. He said no matter what. Kill who? A bar waiter who's also yakuza. What's it all about? - l can't say. - Tell me or l'll be in trouble! You want to know where the gun is? lt's no good shouting at me. This is his address and phone number. Tell me which bar he works in. Flashback. The space museum? No, Sapporo. l've been there. Sapporo? What's his name? lshimori. That's everything l know. Did you tell the kid? l had to. He wouldn't leave me alone. Do you want him to kill that waiter?! l just want him beaten up. Hachiya, get up... We're here. We've arrived in Tokyo. Give me a smoke. Come on, get down. l want to stay and have a smoke. Come on, get up or you'll have to eat on the train. He told me he wanted to stay with a friend there. He left last night. Who's this friend of his? l think he's called Harumi. His family runs an inn. l see. Excuse me... but who are you? Well, l graduated from the same school. What's wrong with you? l have a bad feeling. lt's the same feeling l had yesterday. A bike race in Kawasaki... is different from a small town's. Ever since l was little, l always lost when l gambled on a trip. lt's unlucky to gamble on a trip. - Excuse me, where's Hirouchi? - That way, it's not far. Don't do it. lt's a waste of money. A soapland can rejuvenate us and give us a good start. Anyway, the race hasn't started yet. We need to wash away our bad luck. - Excuse me, are you Harumi? - Yes. - Can l ask you... - You want lzumi. He hasn't been here. Saeki asked about him last night, too. Saeki? Who's that? Arata, don't be angry. This is my first time to Hokkaido. l don't want to miss the boat and watch the channel at night, alright? Give me a break. Miss Saeki? l hope you'll tell me everything you know. He still has the gun, right? lt's too late. What do you mean? l think he's on his way there now. l lent him the money. He already left? Will he be arrested? lf the police learns about it. l guess you've never met him. l hope you can stop him. Hachiya, your first time on a boat? The first time was on my honeymoon. lt was night time. Lounging on white sun chairs and watching her under the sun... l felt l was the luckiest man on earth. There was sun at night, too? ldiot, l mean lights! Electric! Hachiya, why did you get married? Because no one talked me out of it. l'm going to Sapporo tomorrow... Are you sleeping? Duty? No. So what for? Maybe... l'm sick of this mundane life... To forget the reward. Forget what l did. Forget my gun was stolen. Forget the trouble from the missing gun. That's why l need to track him down. Anyone will do that, to forget... lt drives them to do something else. Like you, you want me to stay here, So you can forget your boring life... and your ex boyfriend. You're wrong. lt's because l love you. You're trying to forget another man. That's why you love me. When l sleep on the bed and your on the floor... Does that help you forget? Attention all passengers. The train will arrive in Sapporo soon. SAPPORO Welcome to Sapporo Station. We wish you a happy journey. Even if we can make it, Kyushu's far away. The taxi driver says the flowers will die by the time they get there. Don't be so stubborn. Where's our luck gone? l told you l'm never lucky on trips. They say they have dried flowers. Let's get some. That'll be a flower mummy. What are all these places? FLASHBACK l heard that Shimizu's staying here. ls he here? He's not here. He's gone to Sapporo. You're lying. You're hiding him! Shimizu! lt's you. No wonder you look so familiar. You're the one who put sunblock on him. - Go away, l don't want to talk to you. - Where is he?! - l don't know. His gun was stolen. And now he's cheated by a whore! Get out! You're not welcome here! Passengers can check in now. Time to check in. l wanna go with you. Will we make it? He has a gun so he can't go by plane. He's going by train. He left two days ago, l think... He wouldn't get to Sapporo until this morning. And he won't use the gun during the day. When we arrive at the airport it'll be after 6 o'clock. There'll be some light. But from the airport to Sapporo... lt takes 28 minutes by express. lt'll be dark then. There's a night train. - Really? - Look up there, under Flashback. - That's great. - We'll check it out later. No, let's do it now. We have time anyway. Welcome. Excuse me, is Mr. lshimori here? Who are you? l need to see him. He's gone. He doesn't work here anymore. Do you know where he is? l don't know why you want to see him, but a kid like you shouldn't have anything to do with him. Please tell me. l heard he's working at Silver World, in a pachinko shop. - You wait in the hotel. - Why can't l go with you? This is too dangerous for a girl. Really? You mean lzumi will hurt me? l'm talking about what's going to happen. What's going to happen? l don't know, that's why it's dangerous! - Does Mr. lshimori work here? - Yes. l'd like to see him. Ishimori, come to the front. You have a visitor. What is it? Do you want me? Have we met before? You've forgotten me. Don't you remember? You're acting strange. What is this? - Let's find a place to talk. - l'm working now. l can wait. l don't get off until 9. And l have a date at 9:30. Alright, l'll give you 10 minutes. Here? ln the cafe around the corner. l'll be waiting. Emiko's got a lovely voice. So her name's Emiko? lt ruins her image. Why do you say that? You ever been called lovely before? - lf nobody ever called me that, then l wouldn't be a woman, right? - Right. - l've never called anyone that. - Me neither. Maybe you've never held a woman before. Wait for me here. - Why? - Because it's dangerous. When you're waiting for someone you should sit where you can be seen. - What would you like? - l'm okay. So what is it? - l came from Kagoshima, the Silver Chariot, where Miki works. - Miki? What about her? She wants you to tell me she misses me? l've missed you ever since what happened! l was that student. What you did to me in the park. Let's go to the park. What for? - l want to do to you what you did to me. - Shut your trap! l had you crying for mercy! lf you don't want anymore, then get out. l don't want to waste my time with a kid. Sit down! ls that real? ls it loaded? l have four bullets. Sit down. Stand up! What do you want? Go to the park, and get my bag and the bill. You want me to take your bag? lf you run then l'll shoot. You're the reason l came to Sapporo. What does lavender represent? l've told you many times. lt's trust. - Trust what? What do l trust? - l don't know. Go ask the flower. That's him! The one in the yellowjacket. That's lzumi. Wait! He's not alone. lzumi! - Are you okay? - lt hurts! Watch where you're going! - Hachiya. Wasn't that the guy on the train with us? - Really? - That's the girl we saw at the zoo. - Really? - Yeah. Wait. l'll do what you want. l don't want anything except your blood! Don't be stupid. l told you if you ran l'd shoot. So l have to shoot! Stop! lzumi! Stop! Drop the gun. Don't shoot. l was wrong. Please, forgive me. Don't shoot! Don't kill him!
