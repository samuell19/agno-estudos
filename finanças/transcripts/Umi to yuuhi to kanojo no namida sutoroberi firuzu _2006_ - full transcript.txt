This is where I grew up. I've since moved away. But a part of me remains here. I vividly remember being 17... and in love with strawberries. The town lay between sea and hills. Among old samurai homes leftover from the Edo Period... with beautiful tiled roofs... I walked to school every day. So many shrines and temples... Historic yet modest... charmingly rustic and cozy. The ringing of temple bells was always soothing. In summer, there'd be huge, fleecy clouds above. So I began shooting them with an 8-mm camera. A dramatic backdrop to a picturesque town. My high school. A wooden structure built in the early 1930s. Cold in winter, hot in summer. But all I wanted to do back then was graduate and leave. I didn't have friends. I was always alone. I couldn't wait for school to end... so I could play with my camera. I short, my life was sad. I'm home. I'm home. Welcome back. You'll be late for work again. Look at the time. Why are you so late? I was filming. You should worry about your grades. Like your sister did. Harumi? I'm going to work now. Natsumi? Tetsuo brought strawberries. Really? Where? Do your homework first. Where are they? I know you did it! - You did this. - Wasn't me. Bullshit! Who was it then? You? It wasn't, I swear. Then, who? Stop it. Stay out of this! You'll get in trouble again. Take your seats. Watch it. Attention. Bow. Be seated. We just got word from the prefecture. Maki's been entered in the judo tournament. Mr. Nagatsuka has more to say about it. Please. This is a great honor for our school. A first, in fact. Three students from each class... are to go support her. First, there's the contestant herself. - Hum... Maki. So from this class, we'd like... as many participants as possible. Teacher... it's during summer vacation, right? We have summer school. "You're gonna lose!" Isn't there anyone? You're her classmates! - Teacher? - Yes, Mika? I'll go cheer for her. As class president, I'll represent everybody. Great. Me, too. Natsumi and Risa? No, I... Yes, I'll go. I'm glad. Give there three a hand, please. Maki! Maki! I'll do my best. Commemorative photo time! To Maki winning it all! Say cheese! I'm here! Sorry to keep you waiting. Let us bow together. Thank you for your support. The cremation will take place tomorrow morning. Now... I invite all of you... to dine in the adjoining room. Natsumi needs your support now. You should have died instead. Maki... Mika... Mr. Furumoto? Where am I? Maki, is that you? It appears we've died. What? Mika? Where are we? On our way to heaven... I suppose. What? But I don't want to die yet. That's the way things go. But I have a tournament to go to. Do something! It's over by now. I bet they're having our funeral. What are you saying? That you bring bad luck. Stop it! Maki! Did you hear that? Mika! It's Natsumi. Where is she? Risa! It's coming from below. Wait, don't go alone. Maki? Natsumi? You're alive? Mika... and Risa, too? Tetsuo! What is it? It's Maki, look! And Mika... and Risa. They're all okay! Get a hold of yourself. Maki is dead. Tetsuo! It's me... Maki! Mika and Risa, too! Tetsuo... It's me! I've come back! Look, Maki's right here. Your parents came, too, Risa. Natsumi's talking to someone. Cool! Idiot! Let's leave her. Did my dad come? No. Not yet. Figures. Who is that jerk? "I am... death"? "My job is to transport souls." So you made me a ghost, huh? Turn me back! Let... go. I can't... breathe. "You died in an accident." "But those who cling to life... wander the world as ghosts." "You each have... 48 hours... from the time of death"? "Look in your pocket." "You each died... at different times." "I'll come for you... when it's time." Like Hell you will! I have 19 hours? Till tomorrow afternoon? 21 hours... 20 minutes. Until dusk tomorrow. For me... 33 hours... and 15 minutes. The morning... in two days. You should go home, Risa. I think so, too. That's a waste of time. Tetsuo! Natsumi! Wait a moment. Why didn't you come to the vigil?! She was your only daughter! Why... didn't you drive Maki to the tournament? What? Don't give me that. If you had taken her... she'd be alive. Son of a bitch! Don't blame Tetsuo, asshole! Damn you. Why... weren't you kinder to her? Say what? When her mom left... she stayed here because she was worried about you! I know that! I should've take more interest... in her life, her Aikido. It was Judo. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. I hate you! Damn it! Maki... Mom's home. - Hurry and hide! - Why? Oh, yeah. What a sight. Can I get you some water? Here, drink up. Why? Why did only Natsumi survive? Don't talk like that. She used to be so cute. Stop it! Why? Why? Stop it, Sis! Please! Sis! Stop it, you hear me? Stop it! My friends died. They were all 17. But you're alive. I need your support. I'm totally lost. I thought you came from a peaceful home, Natsumi. With a sister like that? Don't be rude. At least my family is sane. Hey... watch your mouth. Cut it out. We don't have time for this. You're one to talk. It's the truth. I'm not hanging with her. Risa! Please, no. I'll get them back. Mika... Isn't there something you want to do? You've got... 3 hours. Just 3 hours left in this world. Hey. What? You liked strawberries, too? Me, too. Children. They're not fattening. Give me a break. Go ahead, Mika. Death is sure cruel. Natsumi... eat it for her. Here. Eat this one. Well? Tastes bad? This one next. Mika... Think of something else to do... instead of staring at cake you can't eat. Didn't you have a boyfriend or something? There was a boy... I admired when I was a freshman. Who? Fukamachi, on the baseball team. He was a pitcher. Well, let's go tell him. Now... he plays for a company team, right? Yes. Let's go see him. He's close by. Natsumi will speak for you. Tell him Mika's feelings. I'll pass. Risa! You only have 45 minutes. Suit yourself. This way is fastest! This way. There's someone we have to see. Wait... just a little longer. Then move aside! Please... it'll only take a minute. I wanna stay with you! I don't want to see anyone or go anywhere. So take me first. I don't want to go! I wanna stay with you! I don't want to go! I wanna stay with you! Mika! Maki! Risa! Natsumi! Mika! Don't leave me, okay? We'll be right there! We'll come after you, okay?! I wanna stay with you! Risa... why'd you try to help Mika? No reason. Oh, come on. You're next, Risa. 2 hours... and 10 minutes. Ouch, watch it! Natsumi... you're here. Yes. Get off me. I once worked... for Risa's father. She was always good... in school and in sports. Top of her class. Kind of like your sister, Natsumi. But... her mom was strict... always saying she had to be the best. Risa was number one in our class. Her brother... was tops in the prefecture. Risa's mom... paid most of her attention to him. Whoa. We're Risa's classmates. Thanks for coming. Risa liked these. I bet she's overjoyed. Come on in! Over here, please. Sit down. I'll be right back. Risa... why didn't you go see them? I can give them a message. Tell them this: we had our differences, but... Oh well. She's really gone, isn't she? I'm relieved. No kidding. Natsumi! We didn't see you. I bet you're relieved, too. What's with you? Risa's is dead. Let's go now. Let's have a party! Yeah! Hold it right there! Is that all you can say? They can't hear you. Yummy strawberries. Want one? Say something to them! Risa's dead! They're supposed to reminisce about her... remember her! She can't even eat those strawberries! Natsumi... go tell them! Tell them! Tell them to remember! You're alive, Natsumi. You're the only one. Tell them. Don't just sit there! Come on, tell them! Forget it, Maki. There's some place I want to go instead. Where are we going? When I'm sad or upset... I gaze at the sunset. The red sun sinking into the sea. So I wanted to end... by seeing it with you guys. I should've been like you, Maki... done wrestling or something. Play the bad guy... the one who resorts to dirty tricks. Me too. I'd be the one that grabs the mike... and curses at everybody. Punch out a spectator. I wanted to let loose. I wish you could have seen that. Please God! Show Risa a sunset! You jerk! Natsumi! Risa! Natsumi! Natsumi! Maki! Get your hands off her! Natsumi! Maki! Natsumi! Risa! I have to tell you something! Give her half of my time. There's something we need to do! Please! Maki! Risa! Natsumi! Protect Maki, okay? Give her something to remember. Thank you. Risa! You jerk! I don't think we're going to find it, boss. It's here, I know it. What makes you so sure? 'Cause it's God's will, right? Right! Truth is, you really like Natsumi. That's not it. Leave me alone. Come on, admit it. Just shut up! That's not it. Hey boss, is this it? That's it! We found it! Hooray! It may be... hard to watch. Ready.

But... Maki is right here. Stop it. I know it's hard... but Maki is dead. But... Tetsuo... I'm still here. Why can't you see me? I told Risa and Mika... to take care of things left undone. But they couldn’t. But what do I do? By tomorrow morning... I, too, will disappear. Maki... Risa... Mika... and Natsumi... a group... of girls who had no friends. My sister never had friends, either. It's hereditary. You're wrong. All Harumi did was study. She didn't want friends. But if she had... she wouldn't have reacted the way she did. She hasn't known friendship. But you... Tetsuo... have lots of friends, don't you? What, these guys? We used to fight all the time. Before we knew it... we were looking for beetles together... peeking into the girls' locker room... stealing watermelons... laughing, even crying sometimes. Now it's like... we are stuck to each other. That's right. Maki... there's something you can do! Your father... didn't come home after all. Probably out drinking. You like strawberries, too! No way... I'm no child. Go ahead. - These are... - From my mom. Damn you, Dad. You hid them. I wonder if she knows... you died? She doesn't care. "Maki, how are you?" "I wish I could see you." She lives in the next town. 30 minutes by car! No time. Mika couldn't see the guy she liked. Risa missed seeing her sunset. Forget it. I made a promise to Risa. To give you... something to remember. I promised... to protect you. Really? Sure... why not? I'll take you. Leave it to an old delinquent to understand. Wait here. I'll go get the car. Natsumi! Mom? You stayed out all night? Where have you been? Tetsuo... I apologize. It's kind of a sacred mission. Someone's got to take Maki to the next town. All three returned as ghosts. But Maki's the only one left. She needs to see her mother. That’s enough. No! Natsumi... Maki is dead. She should see a doctor. Why don't you understand? I've been worried sick about you. Why now? You've only cared about Harumi. Take her quickly... before it creates a problem at the PTA. Remember when you drank plum wine with Maki and got all sick? She said it was one of the best times of her life. She adored you! Tetsuo, I hate you! Get the car! Let's go! You need to see a doctor. Teacher... I really am worried about you, dear. Come. You have to believe me! Maki is here! Maki! Maki! Please believe me! Don't do this! Natsumi! Maki! Maki! Natsumi, get in! Tetsuo! Hold it. Maki! Where are you? I can't see you, but worry and get in! Maki! Okay, here we go! After them! Sis? Tetsuo? Ever since... I was in high school... I've been able to see strange things. Things other people can't see. Ghosts... Death... I even saw dad when he died... as a ghost. You know what he said? "Look after Natsumi." "Take care of her for me." I studied all the time... to make him proud. I even became class president. Then I had my accident... and was paralyzed. And found myself instead in your care, Natsumi. I could see you girls. But I didn't care. But... I was happy... to see dad. Even if he only talked of Natsumi. I was glad to see him. Anyway... let's get Maki to her mother's house. Got the address, Natsumi? Okay, let's floor it! This is a sacred mission! The house is up there. It'll be faster to walk. I'll be right there. Sis... thank you. Are you Maki's mother? Yes, that's correct. I'm Maki's friend, Natsumi. Have you heard what happened? About Maki? She doesn't know... that I died. I'm afraid... that Maki... Natsumi! Maki! I have a message from Maki! Maki, tell me! Hum... Maki, hurry! What about Maki? Maki, wait here. Please... give Maki time to speak. Then... take me with you instead of her. Mom? We didn't get to talk much... while I was alive. So let me say this now. Though you can't hear me... I'll say it anyway. I'll die here. So take me. Mom... you always worried... if I had any friends. But... I had three. Why stop me? You are death, aren't you? Don't take her! She's important to me! Mom... I realized something important. My friends taught me. I realized after Maki, Mika, and Risa... shared their pain with me. I learned so much being with them! It's all in the letters I wrote with Maki! Adults... separate us through school performance. They force their old thinking on us. But... we're different from them. We don't want to be separated. But... nobody understood that. Not my mother... not my teachers... could understand. But Mika did... Risa did. And Maki did. It made me so happy. All that studying at school... couldn't teach understanding. Laughing together... crying together... struggling together... teaches understanding. Makes true friends. I learned this from Tetsuo, too... and his friends. So... I wanted everyone to know... I've made some true friends. I want Makis' mom to know, too. Mom... can you hear me? I know... I should've come to you sooner. Maki? Mom? You can hear me? Don't take her! Maki? I'm right here. No! Maki, is that you? Where are you? Where are you? Maki! Maki's here, isn't she? Natsumi, hurry! Your daughter, Maki... Maki! Don't leave me! Maki... Natsumi! You have to live! For Mika... for Risa... Make memories! Get up. Stand up, Natsumi! Get up. Get up! I won't forget you! The truth is... I loved strawberries. Second only to my dad's pickled plums. Natsumi! Maki! Natsumi! Natsumi! Maki! I'll be right back. My mother decided... to move us away to the city. To leave this town... full of memories... of Maki, Risa, and Mika. I wanted to see them once more... talk to them once more. Those were my feelings... as I left this town at 17.
