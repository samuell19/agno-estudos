Let me go! Let me go, I say! You killed my mother! I will hunt you down and kill you! You can't get away from me! Let go of me! Your death will be at my hands! You want to kill your own father, dear boy. Isn't that wrong? Listen to me. If you stay with your father, like your three elder brothers... ...you'll be able to study well and have a good life. With this man? If I go with him, I will neither get a good life nor be a good son! Who do you wish to go with? My uncles! Are the boy's uncles present here? Greetings, sir. He disowns his father and stubbornly wants to go with you. Will you be able to take care of the motherless boy? They raised my mother so well! Won't they do the same for me? If you force me to go with my father, I'll smash his head when he's sleeping! When he threatens to finish his father in front of witnesses in court... ...he'll only get provoked at the constant sight of his father. Once his rage against his father dies down, and he sobers... ...I'll bring him over then, Balu. Until then, take care of everything. 'To bring you here, the sky's eye turned a womb, my dear' 'Paths infinite ahead for you to tread' 'In the anguished heart, there can be no unending sorrow' 'Come as the smile of the cacti flower in the harsh drylands' 'The Earth is a mother's nourishing bosom' 'Wherever its water flows, even a barren land blooms' 'Wherever you may go, the sky will keep you company' 'It will never leave anyone behind' Mom! She burned before my eyes, uncle! Get over here, mom! No, dear boy! Listen to me! 'To bring you here, the sky's eye turned a womb...' Get out here! You killed my mother, didn't you? 'Paths infinite ahead for you to tread' -Drop it, I say! 'In the anguished heart, there can be no unending sorrow' 'Come as the smile of the cacti flower in the harsh drylands' Hello! Mic testing 1, 2, 3! -(A few years later) On the occasion of our town's Full Moon Festival... ...for giving us approval to hold today's wrestling competition... ...and also for being our eternal rock and light, we welcome Tahsildar Muniyandi. Good morning, uncle! We welcome the only son of our MLA Pathinetampadi, who is with us today... ...and Mr. Kathiravan, the chief of the Kallapatti Kailasanadhar Temple Society. Good morning to you too! After extending our gratitude on behalf of the entire village... ...we introduce the competitors of today's wrestling match. Sembadayan, who is like kin to Tahsildar Muniyandi... ...and the only son of former wrestling champion Kuthalathevar. And his opponent: He who taught us several forms of art... The revered and respected teacher... -Hey! Sorry, uncle! Nerapandi Thevar's brother, Panthalbalu! -Greetings! This is our chance, Kuthalam. No matter what, Balu must not win. We must win to get what we want! Don't worry, brother. I've instructed our guys to finish off Balu. What's up, Balu? Not getting in the game? No! -Then why the hell did you enter your name? I'm not getting in. But someone else is, on my behalf! What? Then why didn't you enter his name? If we had done that, half the people here... ...would've crapped themselves in fear! Tell him to step up, oldie! We'll see who craps themselves in fear! You've never seen me in action, have you? Hey! Never mind you being in action! Watch him walk in with a swag! Hey, Kuthukalu! Kuthukalu! -Buddy! Hey... is that your estranged brother? -Yes. Why is no one handsome like brother-in-law in your family? Just shut it! Make sure the movement is grand! They're seated far away and can't see well! Hey! Keep at it! Shake those legs! Let them be awed! Underground movement! Look at this, guys! Who is this, Suruli? Like a God wearing sunglasses, blazing as a fire! Hey, son of Rajamani! Tell him to step up first! We'll see who is a fire here! You got it! Kuthukalu? -Yes? Take care of this! How does it look on me? What's this, Mr. Kuthalam? Your claimed no one could measure up to your son! It appears someone can! -Hey! No wonder. It is Sir's blood that runs through Viruman. Uncle! -What? He won't be getting up. Game over. Let's go! Kali. Hey! Hold up! You show off after beating up one guy! There are ten guys like me. Beat us all up and then dance away! Never mind ten people! My lad can beat up as many people as you bring! Go for it! Come on! Stop! Stop! Yo, you in the yellow! Our man's won, right? Give us the trophy and we'll move on! We got places to be! Your father is sulking too much! Bring it over! Tahsildar Muniyandi will honor Viruman, the victor, with a garland... ...and present him with the trophy. Who? From this guy? I never wanted to lay my eyes on this man again. And you expect me to take the prize from him? He's a damn opportunist... I can't accept a prize from a man who tried to kill his own wife's brother! Uncle! Call forth Yogaraja to collect the prize from His Highness! Bring him over! Give me my shirt, brother. -Come, mate! Come forth! All four feet! Look at the prize giver, mate! Thrash him... -Hold on! Did he come here to honor a donkey? Don't insult the poor creature! He can carry loads! This guy isn't even worth that! Viruman! Come, Conquer, Leave. Why bother talking to mongrels? First, it was donkeys. Now, mongrels. No one can touch your mother's property without your signature! I'll do it, man! Hey, Nerapandi! Besides raising chumps like yourself... ...you trying to humiliate me before the village? I'll finish you all! You've not changed a bit! Let's see if you bump off my uncle... ...or if I finish you off first. We sure will! Yes! Let's go! Had our guys been sharp, this wouldn't have happened! I've raised a bunch of crapheads! I beget four sons. The last one clashes with me as a demon! Misfortune made its way to my doorstep! He didn't make his way to our house. He has come to claim it. You wanted to end him, but appears he might end you! We'll bloody see! I'll end him and his little place! Yeah right. Stop tailing me! Find out where he is! They've made the temple bigger! Sure they did! Your father tried to take the deity down! But we put up a united front and kept Him standing tall! Dear son! -Yes, uncle! Have a little spin! -You got it! Never mind the spin! Shake your leg a bit! What do you say? Spin or shake? First, we shake. Then, we spin! -Excellent! 'Handsome like a divine bronze statue' 'You are a dashing lion' 'A stunner of a man' 'The king of this land' 'Once he starts spinning, even the wind starts sweating' 'The skies shiver... The rivers quiver...' 'Here comes Viruman, like a Jallikattu bull, breaking barriers' 'Fireworks across the fields... Enemies take to their heels...' 'Here he comes to uphold our honor' 'His blows are lightning bolts' 'Enemies turn into dolts' 'His blows are lightning bolts and turn enemies into dolts' 'Here he comes to celebrate love and rage' 'Honor is Viruman's biggest strength' 'Mess with it and down goes your health' 'Honor is Viruman's biggest strength' 'Mess with it, and down goes your health' 'The skies shiver... The rivers quiver...' 'Here comes Viruman, like a Jallikattu bull, breaking barriers' 'Fireworks across the fields... Enemies take to their heels...' 'Here he comes to uphold our honor' 'Dance a twirl and light the incense' 'There sways the lush fields' 'The land that is bountiful' 'Feeds hungry tummies in full' 'Extending to the continent of ThenKumari, spreads our ancestral Tamil land' 'It was our tribe that ruled all of the ancient South' 'Our dynasty knows no fear' 'We are a continuity of our past' 'When Viruman walks, it's a procession in itself' 'Even a fierce tiger would shiver with fever' 'Our mother's womb is our armoury' 'Even granny's earrings has the power of an atom bomb' 'Even a little box of herbs, proclaims how we uphold our identity' 'If you ask for its tale...' '...even our Paapapatti granny's snuff box can tell of a history as grand as Keezhadi' 'Honor is Viruman's biggest strength' 'Mess with it, and down goes your health' 'Honor is Viruman's biggest strength' 'Mess with it, and down goes your health' Hey, man! How many times have I told you not to sell ice cream when the school bus comes? You don't get to dictate my business hours! Why step out if you don't have money? Why not just stay home like a pubescent girl! You just keep shooting your mouth off, eh? I'll break your face! -Hey! Get going! Why speak so disrespectfully to women? I'm a businessman and she won't let me do my work! Give the kids some ice cream. -No need for that. Why not? Can't I buy some for my brother's kids? Who else is supposed to buy it for them, brother-in-law? Ponnuthayi! -Yes, sister? Afraid they'll kick us out? Let them! And we will earn our keep! Only this sort of thing can give us a new lease on life. Don't be afraid, sister. Be brave! Your sisters-in-law may be well reputed outside. But at home, this is the fate for them and your brothers. Let it go, man. That's what we're here to fix. We'll handle it. What is it, uncle? -My sister's flexes are here. Hurry! We need to get to it! -Alright. Good grief! Come out and look at this atrocity! What are you saying, mom? -Just come look! Look at that arrogant fellow's handiwork right in our front yard! See that? -Hoist it up higher! My mother must be seen from everywhere! -Yes, brother! We'll do it! Hey! Who set up these flexes? I did! Brave lad! Not just in front of your house! Look up! -They're here, huh? My mother is basking in all her glory! "Glory", eh? -Did we hoist it too high? Planes won't crash into it, right? It has your pictures too! -We had no idea, father! A beating is what you need... Who gave you permission to put them up here? Cat caught your tongue, oldie? Get your boss up to speed. -Okay. Was the beer you had yesterday nice and cold? Yes, even more than usual. So what? The beer was nice and cold because it was in the fridge he gave as a bribe. Money makes you sign off on anything! Hell, you people even gave an arrest warrant for Abdul Kalam! Feel the sting? "Talks so much, but says so little!" He's got the proverbs down pat, sir! Listen up! Not just for today... For the next three days, you and your mom must bear the agony of looking at my mom! You can't do a damn thing about it! "I can't do a damn thing", he says? Watch me! Hey! -Careful! Grandpa slipped and fell! The impudence! My son is hurt and you applaud? What are you glaring at? Why wouldn't she glare? We don't have room for the treasures she brought with her, do we? Even dogs in this house bark in arrogance! Can we expect anything less from her? How dare you glare at my father? Hey! Quit being so macho here! Prove your manhood to your brother! You used a donkey to humiliate father... ...and now you do this? I would've ended you right there, but let it slide as you were family. You remain mother's son. We'll remain father's sons. Please don't drag us into your mess. If we walk out on him, the lunatic will give away his wealth to an orphanage. It'll leave us destitute. You do you. We'll do us. What say, brother? Just this once, brother. Please listen to me. -Okay. We'll do what you say. And you do the same for us! We signed away mom's property to him, right? You sign it too! And we'll do what you say. You can't, right? With whose permission did you put up our pictures? How dare he... Like you haven't embarrassed us enough. Rip them out! Not one flex must remain up! Spew brotherly crap and we'll skewer you! How about that? You said I couldn't do a damn thing! The folks whose photos you used ripped it off themselves! That's Muniyandi! Am I your father or are you mine? Even if your brothers choose to fight you, you must not fight back. If your brothers are hurt, you must give up your life to save them. You must be the sun that illuminates the entire world. All these years, they never stood by you. What made you think they will come now? Life can sprout even from a dead tree. But love will never flow in the hearts of your brothers. Your father won't allow it. And the three will never come. They will. My mother will bring them back. Dear God, please grant my sister and me good lives. Please grant that my brother-in-law gets a driver's job at the PRC. If he does, I'll make a silver necklace for you... ...and throw a feast. -Thaen! Please get him that job. -Hey! What is it? There's no one outside the temple to receive your alms. In fact, no shopkeepers, either! You dunce! You haven't checked well! Me? Not check properly? See for yourself, honey! Take a good look! Didn't I tell you there is no one? You didn't believe me. Buzz off! Sister Maari! -Yes, Thaen? How come there's no one at the temple to get alms? Sister Muthu's son Viruman... For his mother's anniversary, he's serving biriyani to everyone. Everyone's gone there. I'll be heading there soon too. "Viruman?" Who is he, sister? Your suitor! Hey, Kolavikallu! -Yes, sister? Aren't you coming? They're serving tender goats, it seems! "Tender goat?" -Yes! Hearing that makes my mouth water! Let's go have a look! You can meet your suitor, too! There's that glare already! The meat will take until noon to cook! We can finish up almsgiving by then, right? That's the sole reason I suggested it. -Let's go. Brother? The leaves are spread. Shall we start? Shall we? -Sure, uncle. Are you well, dear boy? Do you recognize me? Our town's collector! You wouldn't know. Your eldest brother Selvam married my eldest daughter. Even family needs to be introduced these days! Shall we start the feast, brother? -Yes. Hey! -Get the biriyani. Sir? -Get the meat, uncle. You came too, dear? My younger daughter. Her name is Thaen. He's started his game already! Why don't you stay and eat too? Never mind me. You return home soon! My sister! Go ahead! Father-in-law's really pissed. He needs his insulin shot. -On my way. Sucks I wasn't around! What the hell, Selvam? You missed a golden chance! Had you ripped his face along with the flex, brother would've been ecstatic! Must you be spoon-fed? Since when have they ever taken initiative? Like parrots, they only do as they are told! Had they ripped his face off that day... I'll do it, uncle. Don't you worry! Had I been there that day, things would've played out differently! If he ever messes with you again, I'll hack him to shreds! Show me your leg, uncle. Leave him to me! Only two days since it was dressed, and it looks ghastly! Might sting a bit, uncle. Please bear it. Hey... -What is it? If your father doesn't get his medications for a week, what will happen? What else? He'll die! That's what I'm counting on, but no luck yet! Here you go. Hot biriyani with tender goat meat and chicken curry. Serve it to everyone, dear. See that, Kuthalam? -Brother? An in-law of Tahsildar Muniyandi. He has brought us alms for our meal! That's why I kept telling you not to marry your son into his family! Did you listen? You said picking a bride from a poor family will keep them in line. Now, he's embarrassing you all over town! You rented out a house to him too! And the oaf hasn't even paid rent! Take that biriyani and leave, dad! Good food made for a good cause. I thought eating it might do you good too. Seems no one deserves it in this house! Your phone is ringing. My phone, indeed! Like you have the means to buy one for me! Every one of your phones was bought with my money! Get the phone! -Yes, father. Even dung on the street has some use. The same can't be said for any of you! Yes, Kathiravan? Look here, sir. No one but me must set foot in the rock quarry! If I can't have it, what's the point of my father being the MLA? Why worry? No matter what, the rock quarry license will come only to you. I am the Tahsildar, am I not? -Great, sir! Have the coffee. The cheek! Coffee for you, but quarry for him! Let's just bump off Kathiravan, Paalpandi. It'll put an end to your problems. Hey! I know when to get rid of who. Quiet! I'll see how they get the quarry! Call the Seven Star Team! Get the kesari. Those who wanted vadais, take it! Go on, buddy. -Buddy... The quarry auction at the Tahsildar's office must not happen. Do what you need to do. I don't care how much it costs. I'll stop it, buddy. What else am I here for? Okay, buddy. -Sure, buddy. Two kesaris, uncle. -Okay. One chinthamani! -One Kings cigarette! The kesari's awesome. I'll have another. How long have I been asking for cigarettes? How long have you been asking? I wasn't talking to you. Who else, then? Shall I summon the collector of Theni? Shall I do so? Quit bonking my head! Why bonk the gentleman in the head? Might mess up his brain! Come, dear! Punch him! Where the hell do you think you are? -Moron! Won't punching his nose deform him? Whack his back! -Do it! Every time they are here, they're hell bent on whacking someone! Get lost! How much do I owe? -As of yesterday, 13,500. Today, 120. 13,620 in total. I'm off to hunt. Where to today? -The municipality toilet auction! Had your coffee? -Yes, sir. Sit down. I'll join you. -Yes, sir. Why bring so many people to an auction? Back then, no one would show up for a toilet auction. Now they are flocking to it. If everyone comes, how can I bid? -True! So, I set up a team! These guys, too? -We can no longer bend to their demands! They must bend to ours! Okay? And if they refuse? -We'll slice off their heads! Looks like they are in an even better league! They're not here to bid. They're here to jack up the bids! What's up? Auction not started yet? How can it when you are here? One, two, three, four, five. Here you go! How much is in there? -Ten thousand. Just ten thousand? It's just an auction for toilets, man! Thank you! Ten from Point Zero. Where to next? -Great. Auction at the tamarind orchard! What the hell? There's only three grand! I only came to lease the trees, not buy the whole orchard. Please understand. Get started on the bidding. What's next? The rock quarry auction Paalpandi mentioned! 10 bajjis and energy drinks for me and Sir. -Got it. Where's the quarry auction? "Quarry auction?" Got a token? We'll take one! Think this is some low stakes auction? -Then what? You can't go in without a token. Get going! I'll deal with it inside! -Hey! Stop! He's grabbing your shirt. Whack him! Why I... -Hey! How dare you hit my bailiff in my own office? Who's the officer? -The Tahsildar! Good! For my clout, whacking a low rung wimp would be shameful! Wouldn't whacking the Tahsildar himself be majestic? Hey! -Take it! Give way! Clear away! Brother Soonapana is coming! Soonapana! Rock it! Come, brother! Stop it! -Stop! Why so shocked, brother? The Tahsildar you whacked in broad daylight happens to be my father! Give me your hand. For smacking him... ...this is my gift of love. -Sink it in! Had I known, I'd have smacked him myself! Do it and I'll get you a ring too! -Right away! The majestic king was met with a skewering wherever he went! Think you're the only one who can spew proverbs? Leaves and leaves of betel, No water for the crap to settle. Got it from YouTube! Keep this up any more, he'll make sure you look sore! See that? He threatens to make you sore! I've wanted to do this for ages. My brother from another mother obliged! That is Soonapana. Unfortunately, I missed the splendid sight! Hit it! -Hit it! Hold it, sir! -I'm killing him today! No need, sir! -Where's the gun? Why take the gun out for this? A man of your stature that too? Father-in-law? -What? You want dosas or chapatis for your meal? Butcher the goats and serve biriyani to all! All you people do here is eat! Why get so worked up over a meal? That's not it, Kathiravan! He honors the man who beat up his own father! Some son, he is! Money makes him haughty, brother. That's it, right? Look how I cut it down! The elders suggest to stay quiet when one feels anger. You expect me to stay quiet while he just goes on and on? Sorry, sir. Have you filed a tender this year? -Yes. Listen up. -Yes, sir. Aren't you the society chief this year? -Yes, sir. Cancel his tender and give it to this man. No big deal, sir. You got it! Yo, Velladu! -It'll be done! Our work's over. But you still haven't collected the money! They'll pay up! Not a care in the world! Hey, uncle! Isn't there anything you wish for? Nothing for me. I just want you to have a good life. Here you go, brother. -Give it. I'm hungry. Let's go eat. We're off to go eat, uncle. -You go on. I've already eaten. Come, let's eat. -My brother's shop is here. Let's go. "Brother's shop"? -Come on! This place is as big as the ocean! Sure is big, but the heart is small. Where'd he go? He must've gone to a good place to eat. Waiters plenty at an empty eatery! What do you got? -Hot idlis! Fifteen piping hot idlis, it is! -Got it! Tell them how much you want. Got any money? -Oh dear! Just five idlis for me! Oh no! Why is he in my shop? Four crab omelettes too! -Okay! "Crab omelette?" The stove is off for the day and you ask for crab omelettes? Why the hell are you serving them? It's 11 AM. Get the lunch menu up and running! Take these leaves away! He said there were hot idlis! -That's for the help! Even a foe wouldn't ask you to leave after the leaf is spread! Bless you! I will be blessed when you two get going! Get up. Pick it up! Wretched man! He can't spare few idlis for you? And you go around calling him your brother! Never mind that! Maybe he's afraid feeding me one meal would endanger his meals! So he does eat food three times a day, huh? Watch it! -Won't stand a word against his brother... How can you stay chill with those shades despite such sorrow, Viruman? The sorrow is stuck in my throat and makes me tear up. No one must see that, right? That's why! Good grief! Won't you give me a heads-up before you hit the brakes? Look there, brother! -What's there? Get the booze! -They're boozing! They've tied up some folks! Look there, Viruman! Who are you all? You're stacking up stuff and boozing in my place? "Your place?" This place belongs to the temple! No one's disputing that. Until the tender ends, it belongs to me! Kathir said the tender's not coming to you next time! We'll cross that bridge when we get there. Now get lost! "Get lost?" What is he pulling out? As you wish! Viruman doesn't like macho posturing or knife posturing! With a name like yours, he'll hack you to bits! Is that right? With a leg and a half... It's all dark. Where is everyone? -On your left. They all look as if they just got their vaccine jabs! Who are you? Ask your son! He's giving his son a quizzical look! As if beating up my men wasn't enough, you swagger up to my father? Hack him! Wrap this up soon! I'm hungry! Two minutes! You've seen what happens when folks leap towards me. Why do it then? Damn you! Good God! You're just a kid, little man. Beat it! Get going, I say! -Did you not hear him? Same old, same old! Anyone else? Is that it? There is no issue between you and me. Why then are you messing with me? If some old crone in your family orders you to fight me... ...you walk straight up to me, dear! Don't send your thugs to scare me. If you do... Not only can I erect marquees, I can build pyres too. Tell that to your son! Take care, geezer! Getting old, right? Let's go. He's the architect of all this! And you're speaking to him? What's this? Some chump is threatening me to your face! And you just take it lying down? What should I do? You go for a fight, you grab a guy's collar. He grabs your throat! You don't know how to fight. He knows not how to fear! Guys like him must be dealt straight up! All in good time. Got it? Whose son is he? "Munandi!" Break it! Come out! He'll come out now! -Break that tube! Good throw! What is that noise? -Hey Muniyandi! Come out, I say! Brother-in-law is here, sister! He's going to light it up today! Going to be fun! Why's your father disguised as an old lady? He's dead meat! -It's the old crone! My God! Watch your step! -You wretch! Damn your hands! Why did you wreck my son's name board? Why stone the crone? For what he did, I should've cracked his skull! As mercy, I cracked his board! He sent thugs to beat me! Never mind an MLA's son! Even an MLA can't do me in! Did he send you here to negotiate? Leave! My son just got back from a flag hoisting for Republic Day... ...and is having his meal. The reign of home wreckers is what ruined this nation! You rascal! He's such a well-reputed man in town! -Take this! So disrespectful to him! -Shove it in his mouth! Shall I be disrespectful to you? Shall I? On what grounds, do you claim he's an honorable man? Like how a jackass leads the town procession? Is that it? Father-in-law? -What is it? Brother-in-law is causing a ruckus outside. Grandma went there alone. Don't go there, father! You eat! We got this. Let's go! These guys won't let things lie! Here come the school kids! -Back away! Whack him, Selvam! Why make a scene out here? We try to be freaking civil, yet you keep disrespecting us! Oh please! He'll disrespect you no matter what! Hey! -Talk to him! Get going. And if I don't? He'll get going! I just roughed him up. I'll hack you all up! Father-in-law! They went to look, but aren't back yet. I should've torn you apart when you ripped mom's flexes! I let it slide, as you're my brothers. If not... -What will you do? What will you do? -Careful! What will you do? -"What will I do?" Viruman! -Let go! Listen to me, Viruman! -Let go of me! I'm cracking his skull today! Won't you listen to me? -Let go! Go back! Good God! Why did you fling that can? Who the hell do you think you are? Think you can do anything if no one opposes you? Think you're a big shot? Yes, he is a big shot! Why the can? Why are you crying? -It hurts! What will you do? -I'll do anything for my uncle! Some woman, you are! -Yes! A woman for a woman. And a man to a man like you! Thought father-in-law would get smacked today. You don't know who you're messing with. Get going! -Is that so? If you piss me off... -Go right ahead, man! Let's see how far it goes! Go ahead, man! -Viruman! Go ahead, man! -Retreating isn't becoming of a warrior! Why be disrespectful towards a man? Pipe down! Me too? Get him out of here! -Give me time! What do you need time for? Beat it! Get going, I say! -Come on! Get going, you chump! If I ever see you here again, you've had it! Leave! 'I saw the belle, and then the moon... It is cool, no more' 'I looked into her eyes, and then some flowers' 'It has lustre, no more' 'Without you, she cannot be... Without her, you cannot be...' Shall I send you to the orchestra? They need a lackey! Want to go? A woman cracked my head open with a water can in public! She was disrespectful to this young man here! Wallowing in that sorrow, he's frying fish! You eat that fish and then have the gall to sing melodies? A girl will scold you only if she likes you! And when she hits you? -You loon! You know nothing! -"Loon?" All this while, only my words bound my boy. Today, he stood bound by her! She's no woman. She's a treasure! You won't find a woman like her anywhere! Some woman, she is! Women must be like a demure Goddess. This one's like the Bandit Queen! How a woman conducts herself, is in the hands of her husband! Very well. -Why? Isn't it enough that a demure Goddess got scorched in flames once? What are you getting at? What did Muniyandi ask me that day in front of everyone? What did he ask? He asked me if I was raising a chump just like me and my brother! The questioner may be in the wrong, but the question isn't. Enough of men in this family remaining single! He must get married and raise a family, right? That's what this girl is about! What are you playing at, uncle? How come you like her so much already? Single-handedly she is taking care of her family. Something a father is meant to do! What else could you want? What did you ask me that day? You asked me what my wishes were. I have one! If I had a daughter, wouldn't you marry her? She's my girl. And yours too! That is all! He's considering it! Kuthukalu? -Yes, buddy? Got her number? What godforsaken guy invented this? It goes off at odd hours! Who's calling you at this hour? Go answer! Hello? Who is it? Viruman, the marquee builder! "Viruman, the marquee builder?" Forgot me already? Just this morning, you flung a can and threatened to hack me. So what? You're going to threaten me now? Not at all! Like I could do that to you! Just that... A prospective bride and her family will be visiting me. I want Thaen. -What? I meant cans! I want water cans! Forty of them! One can costs thirty five rupees. No big deal! For you, I'll even pay forty five! But it'd be great if it's here by 6 AM. The address? -I'll send it on WhatsApp! Hey, Thaen! My back's breaking from drawing such a large 'kolam'! Your body always happens to ache when you need to work! How did this girl end up at my home? Or am I at her house? No... This is my house... Oh no! Such a lovely house ruined with this ugly 'kolam'! Who let you in? -"Who let me in?" Go ask the owner! He asked me to bring the drinks! He doesn't even invite me to booze, but he asked you? What did you say? -Well... How come there's no quality stamp on the cans? Did you bring some dirty tap water? Like a jackass would know the difference between crap and gold! "Jackass"? Me? -Hey! Why pick a fight with her early in the morning? All your fault, old man! You went on a drunken ramble last night! And this girl does the same in the morning! I'll bash you up! -As if! Fit only to wash my dhoti! What did you say? -What the hell are you saying? I'll bash you! Why does everyone want to bash me? -Quiet! Here. -You asked for water, but make me draw? A girl is so lowly to you, is she? Please don't get mad. When the bride comes over, the house must look presentable, right? Thanks to your 'kolam', look how pretty it looks! So what if the house looks good? The groom doesn't! Why? What do I lack? Am I not handsome? So you say! It's the bride that's going to suffer! No suffering there. Just say 'yes'. -What? Nothing. You may go. Kolavikallu? Let's go! -Okay. "Kolavikallu"? My girl is here? -Here, take it! What did I tell you and what are you doing? You looking for another girl without me? Didn't you tell me? Didn't you want 'your girl' to come home? -Yes. Your girl got a look at her groom's house. -Okay. Now it's your turn to see her house! You got it! This wedding definitely won't happen. Even if it does, I don't know if my life will be good... ...but my sister's life will definitely get worse! I care more about my sister's life. I can't do anything without my uncle's consent. I don't like anyone my uncle doesn't like. Just hear me out, dear. -You be quiet! Like you've saved up riches for me to pick and choose! As it is, I'm having trouble making ends meet! Please don't come here again to discuss marriage. You shined up the slipper real nice, and made Nerapandi chow it down! You've made me very happy! Here. There's quail! There's turkey! There's chicken! Sister! A blind dog may not know a bone from a stone. But doesn't your sister know? How fortunate for her to get such a fine husband? And she turns him down? All for you, dear! I would never deny my daughter-in-law! "Daughter-in-law"? Like having a pauper already for a daughter-in-law isn't enough! You want one more! -What are you saying? She nailed it on the head that she despises anyone that I despise! Can there be a better daughter-in-law than her? Who is he to find a groom for my child? Even if I die, I won't marry another child of mine into that family! Do you know how happy I felt when you came asking for her? With my elder daughter's life in a mess... ...I felt happy my younger one's life was going to shape up well... ...do I need to be tested like this, brother? Why are you fretting, uncle? My uncle wished for your daughter to be married into this family. That's what will happen. Not what my father wants! Don't worry. Thought she'd figure it out herself. So what if she doesn't? We'll convince her. Right? -Indeed! After finishing up almsgiving, drop off cans at the MLA's house. I'll finish up my water deliveries. After that, we'll go together... Never mind the water. Look at that! Here you go. -Here. Lovely. -Come! It's hot. Be careful. So much for almsgiving! Just biriyani today, son? What else do you wish, swami? Something sparkling! "Sparkling", eh? Come here! Want something sparkling? Touch an electric wire! I'll hack you up, toss you in the biriyani and feed you to the dogs! Beat it! The idiot can't read the room! -My boy... That day, you served biriyani as it was your mother's death anniversary. What's the occasion today? My fiancee's conducting an almsgiving for her brother-in-law to get a govt. job. Tamarind rice wouldn't cut it. So, I'm serving biriyani. My wishes for your victory. -From your mouth to her ears! Here you go. Yes, sis? -Thaen? Those who applied along with my husband got their job orders. Only he didn't get one. What are you saying? The MLA said he'll give the order only if we pay up! How much? Eight lakhs! "Eight lakhs?" How can I raise that much money? Stuck all posters, right? -Yes, brother. Handle things. -Alright. Why did he come here, Karuppu? -No clue. Leave me out of this. You deal with him. -Got it! Why are you here? -Not to see you! Is Brother here? -"Brother?" What's this new tale? Catch! All old ties! When you came seeking votes, you promised to do good if I voted for you. That very bond! Sharp kid. Alright... what must I do to make your life better? My brother Selvam applied at the PRC for a driver job. You said you will give him the job only if he pays up. So, I brought the money. The eight lakhs you wanted. Never mind the money. Giving your brother a job is not in my hands. It's in your signature. "My signature?" Sign away your mother's property to me. I'll be most happy! I wish to build a school for impoverished children. When looking for a place to build it, your land caught my eye. Hence, I ask you for it. Wouldn't your mother be happy if a few kids got to study on her land? You'll sign for your brother's job, right? What are you thinking? I'll do it. -Hey! Get the documents. Here. Between my brother's job and my mom's land, the job is more important. If mom was here, she'd do the same thing. Be quiet. Here. Sign in these three places. Show him. Here. -Sign. Our family deity's name. Sign here. Just leave my uncle's house intact. Build around it. Alright. -Sign here. Here, sir. Like you wanted, my father got your son's signature on white paper. What a crafty plan you made to get him to sign! I know what moves are needed to get what I want, Kathirava. You can deceive him only with love. Here's the order for your rock quarry. Thanks. Also, father asked me to tell you Selvam's order will be in tomorrow's post. Selva! Father! Your work order will be in by post tomorrow. Collect it from the postman. -Yes, father. Happy? -Bless me, father! Tell your wife. -Yes, father. Hey, Kolavikallu! Where are you? What are you yelling for? Wow! New dress, a radiant look, that smile... Why do you look so happy? My sister's husband got that job! We'll light up lamps and throw a feast for God. "Throw a feast?" If you want to do one, do it for Viruman! Because, not only did he pay the MLA for your brother-in-law's job... ...he signed away his mother's land. Besides taking the land, the MLA's son and his men... We're even! You maybe even, but I'm not, dad! What's that? Hey! I'm even too! How many more grudges to settle, kid? He bore it all and just stood by. 'This is a time for silence' 'What burden does the young heart bear?' 'This is a time for silence' 'What burden does the young heart bear?' Hey, Viruman! I mimic singer Janaki really well, right? You're about to get an earful! I can sing this one well too! Just hear it once! One smack and you won't hear forever! -Jeez! Why is the water girl calling me? I'll sing softly. Hello? -Marquee builder Viruman around? Speaking. Who are you? It's Thaen. So that's why it sounds sweet! What's up? -It's nothing. A small function at home. We're doing an almsgiving. I'll handle it. Your address? I'll send it on WhatsApp! The wretch! He made me clean up a truckload of dung! If you wish, you clean up after her! Why must I? Get the basket! The rat may suffer under the sun. Why must its dung too? All dung needs to be dried! What? You wanted us to build a marquee and you have us picking up crap? That day, you asked for water and had me draw 'kolams', right? Getting even, are you? -Yes! Get even with him! If you try it with me... even if an elephant comes, I'll curl it and fling it out of sight. Hey... -What? Why talk of elephants? We'll handle the marquee. Who'll pay the advance? That must be paid, yes? Come in. I'll give it to you. Hold up! Listen! Why are you calling him in? To wash your utensils? It's inauspicious to pay or receive money at the doorstep! That's why! Come in. Why tie a black thread around my leg, mom? My handsome boy must not fall victim to the evil eye, right? That's why! Here you go with the snack! Grab it if you can! Why did you grab it, mom? I'm really fond of my boy, right? That's why I grabbed you! My fiance likes it when my mother-in-law's photo is up. What did you say? Just that... My fiance will appreciate it if my mother-in-law's photo is up like this. Wonder why the girl who glared at you yesterday claims to like you now? My only dream is for my sister to live happily with her husband and kids. After I learned you made it true... ...I didn't know how to thank you. That Kathiravan chap slapped you here, did he not? 'The truth...' 'The truth...' -He slapped me here too. 'The truth...' Hey, Thaen! 'Your intoxicating eyes, O bronze goddess...' 'And that smile of yours, disrobe me, a mile away' 'Your intoxicating eyes, O bronze goddess...' 'And that smile of yours, disrobe me, a mile away' 'That single word uttered by your pearly teeth...' '...gives me the power to sling down the sun from the skies' 'Are you a statue sculpted of pure jaggery?' 'Or are you that fragrant rice that boils on the day of harvest?' 'Are you a statue sculpted of pure jaggery?' 'Or are you that fragrant rice that boils on the day of harvest?' 'Your charms leave me vulnerable to the reaper' 'Your charms leave me vulnerable to the reaper' 'Your intoxicating eyes, O bronze goddess...' 'And that smile of yours, disrobe me, a mile away' 'Waking them in the dark hour of midnight, shaking up those shining stars...' '...I'll turn them into jewelry to adorn your nose and ears' 'I will pinch the night a little and pilfer its dark clouds...' 'I'll turn it into kohl-lines around your glowing eyes' 'Even if I were gored by a bull, I will survive' 'But what will become of me if I were pierced by your gaze?' 'Even when struck by a battle axe, on my feet, I will remain' 'A single caress of yours will have me in smithereens' 'If you so wish, even a boulder I shall eat and digest' 'If you so wish, even a boulder I shall eat and digest' 'Your intoxicating eyes, O bronze goddess...' 'And that smile of yours, disrobe me, a mile away' 'That single word uttered by your pearly teeth...' '...gives me the power to sling down the sun from the skies' Hey! Kill him! He's trapped! Don't do it! When my father finds out, he won't spare you! Just because you're an MLA's son, think you can take all of the town's business? And you expect us to let it lie? You won't do so if you're not alive, right? Well then... Not enough security in town... ...to prevent a person in power from being harmed in broad daylight! What if I hacked you all up? "Hack us?" Why I... Don't worry. He won't hurt you. He's done for. If you're in power, serve the people. Should you choose to run kangaroo courts in town... ...you better run for your life! You are too young to die! Shall we go, Thaen? -Yes! Take a good look! Look how she's clinging on to the man you despise! Shameless girl! You eat, dear. Sis! You're here, uncle? I conducted a ritual at the temple in your name. Here's the holy ash. Holy ash or trick candy? What's in that box? I bought laddoos to celebrate his job order. "Laddoos!" Never mind that. When will you pay up? Forgot it, huh? Of course you did! Only the creditor remembers the loan. Debtors always forget! I'll remind you. During your sister's marriage, what is the dowry we publicly agreed upon? If I get my son a govt. job, you must give 50 sovereigns of jewelry and 50,000 rupees. And if he doesn't, 5 sovereigns of jewelry, and 5,000 rupees. As promised, I got him the job. As agreed, when will you provide the money and jewelry? You didn't get him the job. What? If not me, who got him the job? Your lover? When you're bold enough to back talk to me, you will no longer listen to me. Love makes you blind, doesn't it? Listen! In this house, my wish is the command and will remain so! Your sister's life and yours hinges upon your decision. For this town and this family wait to fulfill what I wish! Either pay up... ...or marry the man of my choice. Don't get my grandson married to this shameless tramp! Would I do such a thing, mom? The moment she fell for a man I despise, she lost the right to be in this family! The groom I mentioned, is Sembadayan over here! Listen up. Don't lose out on your life because you're too concerned with mine! After having three kids, what does my future hold anyway? You're so fortunate to find a husband like him! Did you talk to your husband about this? How could I not? Do you know what that man said? My father only asked for what was promised. Nothing beyond that, right? Listen. Keep up your word. If not, father's got a short-fuse. He might do something crazy. Much like his father, he's itching to have a second marriage! That won't happen, dear! Uncle... My son Viruman won't let it happen! This Muniyandi chap didn't just mess with your lives. He messed with my sister's life too! And his sister's too! He is capable of stooping low enough to achieve anything. Despite being at loggerheads with him, I stayed patient for my sister's sake. That was when the society election of the annual Panchayat Council happened. My brother and I stopped him from nominating a rogue called Kuthalam. Uncle's right. Let's have an election. That's the custom! -We want an election! We want an election! Unable to lash out on us... ...he lashed out at my sister. It was around this time my brother Balu and his sister Dhanam fell in love. My sister and I came to learn about their relationship... What do we do, brother? They are kin. No wonder they fell in love. We'll get them married. Talk to your husband. As it is, I feel humiliated for having married you. And you expect me to wed my sister to your brother? How dare you propose it? Everyone in this town obeys my every command. Your two brothers always question and confront me. I won't get my sister married into such a family! As a wife, you're only here to cook. Quit it with this broker business! Dhanam... This wedding won't happen. Your brother won't allow it. Listen to me. I was born in the same womb as my brother. I'm just as stubborn and fiery as he is. I know how to convince him. Brother? What is it? Just that... Balu and I are in love. Sister-in-law says you disapprove. If you don't agree to the wedding, I'll die. I have already eaten up poisonous seeds. If you agree to the marriage, take me to the hospital and save my life. If not, just leave me be and I'll die. Save me, brother! -Hey, Muthu! What is it? -I'm taking her to the hospital! What happened? -She ate poisoned seeds! She did what? Oh no! She's frothing at the mouth! Come to the hospital with mom! What will I do? Oh no... Brother... What is it? -A girl named Dhanam... Was a girl named Dhanam admitted for ingesting poison? No one here by that name. -What? Anyone named Dhanam came by? -No, sir. Oh no! I have no clue where she is! I know where my son would have took her. I'm thirsty... Water... Water... Give me water, brother. Why did you bring me here, brother? Brother! Give me water, brother! I didn't mean to do this! Forgive me. Spare me the brotherly crap! The moment you threatened to kill yourself if I didn't get you married to him... ...you'd be willing to run away with just about anyone. I don't want such people in my family. Just die. Brother... Please save me... Please, brother. Please save me, brother... Milk is here, sister! Subbu? Subbu! It's 6 AM. I got places to go! Hurry! Where did she go? The door is open too! That'll do. -Put it on the account. Okay. Does he even listen? It's getting late! How long has this been going on? Are you telling me you're three months along? No, sister... Hey! What's with all the racket? What are you yelling for? Like this doesn't happen anywhere! What the hell are you saying? You played your tricks on this poor girl who came to work here! Is that what happens everywhere? You said if my brother married your sister, you'd lose your dignity. Where goes your dignity now? The flowers upon the poor girl's grave hasn't even withered yet! But you wasted no time to commit this heinous act! What did you say? -What kind of a man are you? "Heinous act"? Mom! Stay put! Remain there! Stay there, I say! Listen up. I'm a man! I'll do whoever I want. Who the hell are you to question me? Freaking paupers screw around with two females! Can I not do so too? Not just one. I'll screw around with four! You can't question me! You think I'm a hermit like your brother? He skipped marriage to take care of his siblings. He's a saint! If you ever insult him... And if I do, what will you do? I'll kill you! Listen up. If you can bear it and stay on, do it! If not, pack up and go back to your brother! You needn't do crap here! Don't just stand there. Bring some hot water and a towel! What the hell is all this? -I couldn't do anything, sister. What am I supposed to do after having lost my honor? I'll stay in some corner of this house, like you do. Why did you bring me here? You told me we were visiting uncle. Anytime your mother is overjoyed or depressed... ...taking refuge under His dusky feet brings her peace. Shall we go to your uncle's house? -Okay, mom. Take good care of Balu. Don't let him go anywhere alone. You'll be blessed. Don't you worry, brother. We'll take care. -Alright. Sister! Uncle! Come here! My dearest! Why did you come alone? Where's Subbu? No, brother. She has to take care of the kids and their father. So I came alone. To stay for two days. Alright, dear. The lamp hasn't been lit in three days. Please do the honors. Don't drink water while eating. Why? -If you do, you'll be too full to eat! Tell your mother to eat properly. She's looking a bit out of it. I don't know what happened. I'll go to the house and check. -Okay, uncle. Come eat, mom. Why do you keep crying? More than the respect a woman gets in the home of her birth... ...her self-esteem hinges on the respect she gets from the family she marries into. Your father thinks money and clout are the most valuable things in life. The love of our kinsmen is much more valuable! You must make him understand that. I'll do what you say. I'll make father understand. Please come eat, mom. I will... How much do you like your uncle? This much! Alright... If I'm no longer around... ...will you stay with him? I will! You must listen to your uncle and remain by his side. I'll stay with uncle. But where are you going, mom? I'm not going anywhere. This right there? I'll be right here with you. Please, mom! Get out of there! I'm really scared, mom! Please come out! I can't go on without you! Come out! Let go of me! I can't survive without you! Come out! Please! Let go of me! Get out of there, mom! Please! Oh no! Sister! Mom... After watching his mother go up in flames... ...you have no idea how long my boy was in agony. When I went to call my sister's husband for her funeral, do you know what he said? Neither will I come to pay respects for a woman who died to humiliate me... ...nor will my three sons come! Got it? I know how to get my fourth son back! With three sons already, why do you want a fourth? Let Nerapandi raise him! Only if the boy remains with my brother, will he get my sister-in-law's wealth! That sinner did not allow his sons to go to their own mother's funeral! I would've hacked him to shreds and gone to prison! But... without a mother and a father... I didn't want my sister's sons to be orphaned. So, I buried my feelings and controlled myself. Having been haunted by the memory of watching his mother die... He is hell bent on bringing his father and brothers to the land where his mother died. That's why he's at loggerheads with his father. You two will make it happen. Tomorrow, he'll convene the panchayat. And he must! Only if he does, will there be a revolt. That's what will bring justice. Are your mouths full? Speak up! When I married into this family, without having it down in print or words... ...I brought 400 sovereigns of jewelry and 80 acres of land as dowry. For a mere 45 sovereigns, this wastrel dragged us to the panchayat! The town elders are here, right? Ask him what's what! She has spoken! Begin the injustice! Shut up, baldie! What's this now? Didn't both your families agree on dowry terms the other day? When paid what promised, they can live together. If not, he wants them separated! We ask in a public forum for your response! Are we here to watch them split up because of this man's whims? It's very wrong. -Pipe down. They're all his men. They'll rip us apart! This is unfair! Because he asked, I discontinued my daughter's studies and got her married. Now, he callously asks them be split up? And you silently look on? If he splits them up, I'll go to court! I don't care if you go to a court or to a castle! You can't touch us! This isn't your council. It's ours! Your only job is to pipe down and listen to our orders! If you try defying us... What will you do? Hey man! What will you do? You'll cut off his head? Go ahead! I'll cut off your head too! Listen. I've earmarked a day every year to whack you around. Beating you repeatedly bores me. Just beat it! Hey! With no respect for seniority, you just keep shooting your mouth off! Are we a bunch of kids over here? When they don't deliver on their word, how can we not split them up? Is this a loin string to be split up as you please? Did elders painstakingly teach us values just so we could do this? Be it then or now... ...why were we taught to let women walk ahead of men? To keep them from eloping? No! To silently convey that we will protect the women who trust us with their lives. A council founded by such revered elders... ...will so indifferently split up my sister-in-law's family? My sister-in-law isn't some doormat to take this crap lying down! The officer who is supposed to criminalize dowry asks for dowry himself! And all you nod along at this wastrel's words! Who the hell are you calling a wastrel? I'm calling you! You and only you! A diseased monkey will infect an entire jungle! You dare call me an monkey? No... I can't call you that... Even monkeys hold their families close. You are tearing families apart! Calm down, father. He won't hesitate to slap his own father! What? Slap me, will he? Slap me, will you? Never mind slapping! For what you did to my mom and my aunt, I would've butchered you. For my brothers' sake, I spared you. Let go of me! Listen, brother. It's not my place to give you advice. If you chose to betray your wife on this man's orders... ...you won't die peacefully. You must not ill-treat a woman. And never, your own wife! Don't hoard sins for your sons. Let feuding with a father end with me. Don't make your kids feud with you. Go with your family and live happily. By mom's grace, you got a job. "Mom's grace?" It was by my grace! What? "Your grace?" Cross your heart and repeat that! When the MLA demanded money, what did you say? What did I say? I won't pay a penny for his job! Then what's the point of me being the Tahsildar in my own hometown? If I must pay a sum for my son's job, I don't want such a job for him! Let him drive school buses or sell jackfruits at the bus stop! What do I care? Yes, I did say that. So what? Does money grow on trees? Like you'd pay up even if it did grow there! See that, buddy? Your father's true colors. He paid up the sum the MLA wanted and signed away his mother's land! He generously gave away the land for your sake! What's going on here? I've generously contributed to every ceremony in this town! And you indulge this chump? Listen, Selvam! The wealth I've earned and will earn is for all of you! Who else will I give it to but you? Have I ever denied you anything? Look... This is your life. Don't let some schmuck make you take a wrong decision. Your father will always do what is best for you! Okay? Hey, Selvam! Your father is such a great man! Can you displease him? I think he's talking sense. Who else in this town is as well-learned as your father? Listen, brother. If you agree with these lunatics, I'll smack you along with them! Will they arrest me if I do that? I'll be out in no time and raise your kids like my uncle raised me! Listen, brother. A man does not live on handouts. He is one who fights back! Muthu... Get the kids. Let's go. Let's go, everyone. -Come, dear! Come, everyone! -You ignore me so? I'll stay out of your sight! You won't get a single penny from my fortune! My wife and kids will do. Your tricks won't work anymore! It's not too late. Start over and live a good life. If not... What the hell will you do? Don't do it! Bring it on! -Don't do it! Let go! -Stab me, will you? Do it! Bring it on! You're crossing your limits! Let go of me! -Come on! Oh my! So that's how you silence a town? I've never seen such a panchayat meet in my entire life, buddy! Quiet down! I've gone numb! Couldn't you find a better place to play, buddy? Must we do it here? -Quit whining and whip out the joker! The joker's a girl! I try to be a forgiving man... -Get that gun! ...and he defies me so? -We'll see who's the man here! He's finished! -Don't spare him! Don't do it, sir! -Buzz off! Let go! -Where are you going? Wait! Let your father receive a few smacks! The joker's missing. There it is. Where? Good God! Your father's scoping us out with his gun! Let him! It's not binoculars he's aiming at us! That's an old gun with worthless bullets, uncle! Don't be hasty... Damn! A near miss! All soldiers! Escape! He's leading us to slaughter! Get away! Don't do it, sir! You might hurt someone! He's reloading! The insolence to mock you like this! Shoot him! Arrogant oaf! Shoot! Let's see what happens! Like going on a hunt with a blind dog... you know zilch about taking an aim and you want to hit me! Shoot me in the heart! You dare rile up my son? You've got four sons, right? You can lose one! Shoot! Your mom has commanded, hasn't she? Shoot! What gives, old man? -Oh no! You shoot the ground instead of me? He wasn't aiming at you! Get away! Eyes aren't sharp enough, right? -What did you say? Where's the bullet? Where's the damn bullet? Get up! -Let go! What can that man do to me? Not a damn thing! Get up! -Think I'm scared of your gun? Let go! I can face cannons! Like I'd retreat from such toys! Alright! Why shove me aside? -Move! Let go! -As if! Hey... -What? Ask him. -Quiet! He's furious! Since when is he not furious? Ask him. -Quiet, I say! Can't you be quiet? Will you ask him or not? -How can I? Hey! What is your wife saying? Nothing, father. It's the last day to apply for the canteen auction. If you sign the cheque, I can apply for it. Why? Looking to walk out like your damn brother did? To hell with the auction. Get lost! It's the last day... Get lost, I say! This is why I always told you not to rely on your father! Did you listen? Now reap what you sow! He expects us to be dependent on him for life! Like we don't have enough problems! Quiet! Yeah! Keep saying that! It frothed up well! O dear God... Nothing but joy your way! -Your blessings, uncle. Uncle? -All well, dear? Watch your step! -Yes, uncle. Dad? -Serve the guests! Sure, dad. You take it. -Okay, give it. Here, uncle. Here, sir. Do you like the house, sister-in-law? Are you happy? I'm really happy. Even if a woman can only afford gruel, she must have it with dignity. Now, I can have gruel with my family with dignity, all thanks to you. Thank you very much. Please bless me! -Oh no! It is not right! You have my mother's name. It is I, who must seek blessings from you! Come here, brother! Bless me! -Be well! Oh please! Get up! You'll have a good life! An elder brother is like a father. A sister-in-law is another mother. Uncle? -Yes, dear boy? If you could loan me five lakh rupees to bid for the canteen, it'd be helpful. I can't turn you down, dear boy. If you get your father to back you up, I'll even loan you fifty lakhs! You're not asking for petty cash, my boy. It's quite a sum! If either of us were to ask for a loan, no one would oblige. They'd do it only if you say your father's name! Hell, they'd give only if your father tells them to! Would he back you up? The respect your name commands here pales in comparison to that of your father. Ignorant of that, you go around asking for a loan! Not just me. No one else would oblige you. It hit me when I knocked on many doors to get a loan. It opened my eyes to the life I have lived and the reputation I've earned. Dear... Please don't get angry when I say this. You asked everyone in town for a loan. Why don't you ask your younger brother? How will I face him and ask for a loan? He sat at this very table the other day to eat some idlies at his brother's shop. Afraid of father, I drove him out. How can I go to him now? He wouldn't mind it, dear. He's got a good heart. Thanks a lot, sister-in-law! At least you understand me even if my own brother does not! When it comes to business, my brother is quite bright. With people, not so much. Brother... We may not get to be brothers in our next birth. Let's get along while we are here now. The town mustn't censure our mother saying she didn't raise good sons. A mother gives you love. A father gives you knowledge. But siblings give you support. How can I not help when you are in trouble? Just name which shop you want at the market. I'll pledge my head and get it for you. Please forgive me, man! Oh no... Why cry over this? When is the auction? How will he be able to bid? As long as I'm here... Not just the canteen. I won't let him bid on anything else too! Why babble like an idiot, sir? How can you interfere in the union auction? Just watch! Why did he bring me here? You mustn't come to a place like this, sir. One call from you and they'll come over to our office! If we want to a job done, we need to get down in the trenches. What's this now? Why is this man here? If he plays it, hit him with it. -He won't. You are out! He's probably here to meet Paalpandi. I'm here to meet you. Me? What's up, sir? If my son doesn't win the bid at tomorrow's auction, I'll pay you two lakhs. An advance of 50,000. "Two lakhs?" Not counterfeit, is it? All well and good with the money. Sweeten the deal by retracting the case you filed against us! Yes, indeed! Way to go! -They put you in quite a spot! Alright. -Double the joy then! Where is the auction? We're here to bid on a shop that we've been managing so long. Everyone should just bid on their own shops! So you suggest we don't fight... ...and if we do, someone else might take advantage of it? Exactly. -Alright. There they are now! Seven Star Team! We're whacking and partying today! It's Soonapana! Say hello! Hello, brother! -Hello! Why greet a rival? Come! He got me slapped! They are no seven stars. They are seven jokers! So what? -They won't let anyone bid! Going to be a case of bringing a knife to a gunfight. Just follow my lead. Not just this auction. They'll stay away from any auction. Listen up! Per the accordance of the Panchayat Council... ...shop number five at the Central Market is up for auction. The opening bid for the place is three lakhs! Four lakhs, sir. -Four lakhs! Four and a half lakhs. -Four and a half! Four lakh seventy five thousand! Four lakh seventy five thousand! Five lakhs! Five lakhs! Six lakhs! -Six lakhs! Seven lakhs! -Seven lakhs! Seven lakh seventy five thousand! -Seven lakh seventy five thousand! Eight lakhs, sir. Eight lakhs! Eight and a half lakhs! Eight lakh seventy five thousand! Eight lakh seventy five thousand! -No point now. Let's leave. Damn! He just won't let up! You won't prosper! -You go prosper! Get lost! Nine lakhs! -Nine lakhs! Nine lakh seventy five thousand! Nine lakh seventy five thousand! This isn't fair at all. -Then leave! And they're gone! Are you here to bid, you hellish fellows! Dealing with you is such a pain! -You're one to talk, shameless oaf! Don't block the breeze! Fine, have it all to yourself! Get going! I've seen millions like you! Twelve lakhs! Twelve lakh seventy five thousand! Twelve lakh seventy five thousand! -Way to get me all jumpy! You handle this. -The last elder left too? So what? We'll fight them one on one! -Okay! Fourteen lakhs! -Fourteen lakhs! Fourteen lakh seventy five thousand. Fifteen lakhs! -Fifteen lakhs! Fifteen lakh seventy five thousand! Now watch. Sixteen! Wait! I'll whack you! -What are you doing? Know when to hold them and know when to fold them! It won't work! Are we bidding on Dhoni at the IPL auction? We're here to bid on an eatery! And you keep escalating! I'll set you up with a good shop. You can eat like a king. Come on. Take the place, Muchacho! Tell him to shave his moustache. Quite repulsive! Who is he messing with? -You can't leave! I'm short a few bucks. Let me get it from home! Don't go! -He's got you holding the bag! I don't get it either. 15.75 lakhs going once! 15.75 lakhs going twice! Sixteen lakh seventy five thousand. For your sake. Why keep jacking it up? They've left. We must leave too, right? -Definitely. We can't leave unless we keep jacking the price until the end. Is that so? Watch this. -All together, guys! Alright, let's wrap this up. Seventeen lakh seventy five thousand! Okay? 17.75 lakh going once! 17.75 lakh going twice! -Go on, Murugappa. Seventeen... -Hey! Stop it! Think we're wimps? Eighteen lakh... ...seventy five thousand! The bidders have left, sir. These folks stick around only to ruin things! They're jacking it up to pass the time! I must keep ringing this bell until I'm worn out. May I sit down and ring it? Stay on your feet and ring it! We're bidding so responsibly! Yet, you chitchat so irresponsibly! -Who? Us? Bid away! -Twenty one lakh seventy five thousand! 21.75 lakhs going once! 21.75 lakhs going twice! 21.75 lakhs going thri... Twenty two lakh seventy five thousand! 22.75 lakhs going once! 23.75 lakhs! 24.75 lakhs! -It's time, Subbu! Oh Thank Goodness! Owing to shortage of time, this auction will be rescheduled. One man made a mockery of all of us! And there's this sorry excuse of a curry! Come along, buddy! When he said it wasn't feasible to bid more than 15 lakhs... ...and asked us to bid away... ...I was alarmed! And this guy went all doom and gloom and jacked it up to 25 lakhs! My limbs went numb! Where do we get that kind of money? Why didn't you take it then? Come, sir. Care to eat? Oh please! 25 lakhs, sir! Never mind 25 lakhs! I'd pay up even 75 if it came to that! My son shouldn't get it. That is all! He'd even pay up a crore if it came to it! He swindled away tons of rice from the ration shop and amassed crores! Target the sugar next time, sir. They'll rip your son to shreds! Had you told us this before, we'd have gotten it ourselves! We still got time! Bid tomorrow! And you must! Okay, sir. Like Viruman would let us do it so easily! Besides, everyone will come to bid! We'll bump off the bidders! Viruman hoodwinked us, didn't he? I'll return the favor! Hold up! Hold up! -Shouldn't we go to work? Why have you kept us here? Don't make a sound and you'll get home in the evening! If you do, I'll slit your throats! Make a sound... Lock them up! Go on! Lock up! -What the hell is all this? Who's next? -Viruman! Our own father deems us an enemy and won't let us bid. It really upsets me. That's nothing new. That guy's blowing his own trumpet for an audience of one. He's mad at me, so he's taking it out on you. Don't worry. I got this. How much, brother? -Twenty. They've surrounded us, brother. -Okay. A moth is always drawn to a flame. They'll target me. I'll go left. You go right. What are you going to do? -I'll handle them. Run, brother! -Get them! Come on! He's getting away! Come on! He can't get away! Come on! Wherever you go, I won't spare you! Come on, guys! -You're dead meat! Come on! Kuthukalu? -Yes? Where are you? -At the usual spot! Come on, guys! Faster! Shut the door! Come on! He's busted! Come on, guys! What the hell? That way! Faster! Welcome! Welcome to Soonapana and Co! Our address: Kuthukalu Kolavikallu! 'O sweet Dindigul... Madurai district is mine' 'Spare some time and frolic with me' I'll kill you! 'Spare some time for me' Hey! Stick around for the whole song! I sing very well! He locked us in! Look around for an escape route! Place is like a fortress! He's got us trapped! There's no way out! Busted, eh? Neither will a freewheeling mongrel eat, nor will it let other animals feed! You'll lock up everyone in town. Wouldn't I lock you up, dearie? Chill out for an hour. I'll finish the auction. See you! Take a look around! Per the decree of the Panchayat Council... As no one participated in the bidding of shop five in the Central Market... ...ownership of the Muthulakshmi Canteen remains with the owner Muthukutty! Going once! Going twice! Going thrice! Shall we have them pay up? -Yes. Pay up now. -Give me the cash. Here. Here, brother. Pay it up. Here on in, this shop is yours. You're the sole owner! Go ahead, brother! Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven! Here. -Give it to me. Why are you giving away all your savings to your brothers? I only worked hard to raise this money for my brothers! It's not my wish. It's my mother's. We can't spare him! We can't spare him! -You let him slip and now whine about it! You drink all the time. Are you boozing to forget the shame at the hands of that juvenile? Or are you just shamelessly boozing? Wear saris! Am I a woman? Oh, you think you're a man? You followed him like sheep and fell into this trap... ...and then boast about being a man! If you're a man, whack him. Or smash his shop to bits! Know what that means? I'll show you. I'll prove that I'm a man. Buddy... At the price of one lakh rupees per idli... ...you're the only guy who eats four idlies for four lakhs! Instead, you could've bought a baby elephant! Oh stop it! You asked for crab omelettes, right? When did I order it and when has it arrived? What did I order and what have you served? I'm asking you! -Brother... Didn't you ask for 'appam' and mutton curry? "Mutton curry"? I wanted stove curry (charcoal)! Would anyone eat that, brother? I would! If you don't get what you ordered, beat up the owner! It'll make you feel better. Why beat up this kid instead? Come here. -Brother? Like he wanted, bring stove curry. Bright and white! Okay, brother. -Hey! Brother? -No need for stove curry. Bring me an egg. Okay, brother. Brother... The customer wants an egg, right? Give it to him. You've had it, today! Hey! -Yes, brother? Where is the egg? -The owner's bringing them! "Owner's bringing them", huh? Where is the egg? How dare you draw me eggs when I order one? Let go! Aren't these the guys who beat up everyone in the market? Who beat them up now? When you hit my father, that was right, so I gifted you a ring. And now you dare strike my brother? It's true what they say: Spare the whip, spoil the child! Here! Drink! He's over here, sir! Just broke his arm, did he? Spared his leg out of pity, I believe. You boasted oh so much that you'd smash his shop! And he did exactly that to you! Good thing these saris won't go to waste! Give it to them. Wear it! Enough wasting time with wastrels! Come! Here! Take it! Back to back embarrassments from father and son! Buddy... I'll kill the son in front of the father. I'll kill the father in front of the son! Instead of paying those wastrels, you may as well have listened to Viruman! What did you say? Had you given the money to your son, this board wouldn't have landed in the trash! How dare they toss you in the trash? They only tossed the board in the trash! Today, the board. Tomorrow, Sir himself might get tossed away! Get lost! Fine! -Man's gone crazy! Everyone's talking! Had you just given the money to your son... Buzz off. -Who? Me? Buzz off, I say! What is this? You chase away your most loyal employee? Look here! If my son finds out that you entered this house... He won't object, grandma. "Grandma"? Who is whose grandma? What is she saying? I said you would scold me for letting her in here, and asked her to leave. She defiantly claims her uncle wouldn't mind. Listen. In this house, my mother does as I say. And I do as she says. Why are you here? Did your lover ask you to whisk away my third son too? No, uncle. I came to give you your insulin shot. No need for that crap! Scores of people here who can do that for cash. What did I do wrong, uncle? This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't fallen for that rogue! Had you gotten that job, would I have fallen for him? So you'd fall for anyone who can get you jobs? These crocodile tears won't fly here! The sweet and innocent girl is quite the shrew! Spare him the sentimental humbug! Get going! Get going, I say! Hold it. When will you vacate the house? There it is! I thought you forgot! In a week, uncle. "A week?" At this rate, you'll stay until you give birth! Hand over the keys by five in the evening. Go! For the first time in his life, the lunatic has done something useful... ...by asking you to vacate the house. You'll move in with us after marriage anyway. Move in today itself. Right, brother? Yes, dear. I don't call you 'my child' just because I can. I wholeheartedly do so because I consider you as my child. If you consider me your father, come on over. Go on, tell her, Sangaiyya. Faster, guys! Looks like it might rain! Brought over all their belongings? -Yes, uncle! What a pretty look! My sweetheart! Be careful with that table. Don't drop it! What are you staring at, dear? Wondering why there's a closet full of saris in a house with no women? My son would buy a sari on every full moon... ...and offer it to God in the name of his mother. He wanted the saris he bought for his mom to be worn by his wife... ...and he filled closets with them! That closet is filled with it too. Even saris from twenty years ago! Look! It's all for you! Wear a new one every day and be happy! Just like your uncle, you have us work without buying us food! Food breaks are a waste for time! -For owners, not workers! When I take out a contract, it's food on time and beer for thirst! I keep workers cool! Why is she here? -Who? Thaen! -Thaen? Why would Thaen come here? Where? She was right there. Mr. Viruman! I'm hungry for lunch. You're hungry for something else! Keep your horniness to yourself! Get in! I did see her... -Of course you did! She looked so pretty in a sari! There you are! She's lighting a lamp there, you loon! -Where? Where? She was right there. And you're rightfully pissing me off! Take off those crappy shades! Now look! Is she there? That's it! All cleared up? The issue is in the shades, not the eyes! Go inside. Somehow, I can see her, but he can't. I don't get it... Hey! -What is it? I can see her! -You can see her? Not again! -In the water! Where? Are you sloshed? You saw a water can seller in the water? -I did! Where? -In the water, I say! I'll see for myself! I don't see her. It appears she left. "She left?" Some romance, this is! I'm in love too! You don't see me standing by while my friends are drowning! She's standing there. -Some friend! She's winking. -He's insane. And he's driving me insane! She's smiling! He'll get mad if I tell him. Here's the sambhar. -No need! You'll claim to see her in there too! I can't get in there! Small vessel, too! I'll eat plain rice! Your wish! Buddy... You're in love with her and see her everywhere. Well and good. But why do I see her father? Maybe I'm in love with her father? What the hell are you saying, you fool? Oh, you're really here! Of course, I am. -What about Thaen? She's right there! -Where? I thought she served you the meal! You're really here! Didn't I tell you? Hold it! 'In the sweltering Madurai heat, your rugged swagger has me beat' 'My beau slowly kills me so' 'Come here, my dusky sweety' 'With a gaze hotter than the sun' 'My heart has caught ablaze' 'Give me a boon to climb on your chest... Another one to caress your moustache' 'I'll stick to you tighter than your starched-up dhoti' 'Stick to you, I will' 'Making all of Theni see, I whisk you away, O belle' 'Shall I soak in the sweet honey you are?' 'To make the entire town envious...' 'Shall I bear you a hundred babies?' 'For I am a toppled thug' 'Pick me up, O dusky damsel, and carry me home' 'I'll come with you' 'I'll come with you' 'The scent of my mother lives in the sari' 'I will hold you close to my heart until the end of time' 'Upon my beau's heart, to sleep like a goat kid...' '...I shall seek a boon of ten more lives' 'O mighty princess... I'm forever trapped in your charms' 'You made me a new man' 'I hand over my life to you' 'I'll come with you' 'I'll come with you' 'I'll come with you' 'I'll come with you' 'I'll come with you' Come, man. These two shirk their chores and act all defiant! Let's give them a piece of our mind! -Rock it! What powder are you washing that with? Surf Excel powder, ma'am! How many times have I told you to use Rin powder! Some job, you're doing! -I'm doing it properly! You're the one ordering me around like you do your daughters-in-law! With the peanuts you pay, they can only be soaked, not washed! If you wish, wash them yourself! I'm out of here! Wait for me! She torments me so much! She always pokes at me just like she does with you! Damned if I do and damned if I don't! The impudence of this witch on the verge of her deathbed! Only hens that lays eggs know the pain! Give it a try and you'll feel it yourself! You can't leave without returning the advance! Your big mouth just made us even! They're speaking in chorus! The Sulamangalam Sundaris! Mom! What is it? -Where's Elango? He went out. Want to see? Can't read, right? -The cheek! Quiet! Excuse me, sir? A couple of customers have come. Can they sit here? Sure. -Thank you, sir. Not fasting today, I hope? Come, sir. -This is my dad's colleague's hotel! We eat for free then! Great! I'm serious. -Take it easy for once! Dear... Look who's here! Another seat... "Another seat?" I'm afraid not! Sit down. -Please sit, sir. Sit down, I say! You found a good match. -I'm busted! Busted, huh? -What would you like to have? What do we have? -Two mutton biriyanis. Quiet. -Two chilli chicken fry. Two omelettes. Will that do? -Yes. And you, sir? Answer the man, will you! Two mutton biriyanis, two chilli chicken fry, and two omelettes. Excellent. You like what we like! There won't be any issues! Who is he? -I'll tell you. Well then! Why don't you tell her that I'm your brother! My brother. -Your brother? Indeed! Yes! Hello! -Hello! She's Thaen. My lover. -Hello! Chilli chicken not here yet? This is the chilli chicken! Oh, I see. I'm sorry. -Dig in. Let's eat. Does your father know? Why so quiet, man? He doesn't. How long have you been in love? Four years. Restaurant dates for four years, huh? Decided to raise a family here in the restaurant? When did you plan on telling him? I don't know. "Don't know?" Alright. We'll tell him today! How? Ask me who the hell I am to question you on your love matters, and slap me! Me? -Don't be scared. I won't retaliate. Wait! He's here. Now do it. Who the hell are you to question me, you mongrel? You are truly my son! I heard his slap all the way here! Had you slapped him a few more times, I'd be even happier. I hear you're in love with a girl. Who is she? MLA Pathinetampadi's daughter. He takes right after you, sir! You'd only ask to get money from the MLA. He was able to get the MLA's daughter herself! You hit the bloody jackpot, Elango! Not just a jackpot. It's a mega jackpot! He fell in love with a girl, rolling in the riches... ...and saved my honor by picking her as my daughter-in-law! He truly is my son! My entire fortune is for him! -Yes! Yes! Mom! Shall we speak to the MLA? With pleasure! When I asked you money to get a job for your son... ...you wouldn't part with a penny! Should I trust you with my daughter, I'll be screwed! Listen up! I can't give you my daughter. "You can't?" -Now leave. Brother! Tell him that if he doesn't, you'll just whisk her away, brother! What? -He's worked up! You'll whisk away my daughter when I'm here? You sure you can pull that off? Go ahead and try! Do it if you're a real man! I refused because he asked. Did I refuse you? Tell me! Say what? What did you say, brother? I refused because he asked. Would I refuse if you asked? Say what again? How can I refuse a man... ...who's ready to lay down his life for his family? You didn't take my son's slap to heart... ...and rescued him from Paalpandi. You are my family deity, Viruman! Riches are of no importance to a woman. Safety is! Is there a better protector than you? Excellent, brother. Don't say 'brother'. Say 'uncle'! Happy, sir? Don't call him that, anymore! Happy, in-law? He refuses me when I ask for the girl. But he'll do it when that guy asks! Father? -That girl won't suit us. I'll find you thousands like her! You wouldn't even give me a thousand rupees! Like you'd find me a thousand girls! Forgive me, dad. If I marry, it's only to her. If you don't marry a girl of my choice, you won't get a penny from my fortune! Like you have anything new to say! Rather than hold the hand worth fifty crores... ...I'll press her father's feet that's worth 500 crores! Don't get me wrong, father. Instead of you kicking me out, I'll leave by myself. Hey! Elango, my boy! You must never set foot in this house again! Third wicket's gone too? What's with the constant hit wickets, sir? The kid has sprouted wings, and so he's flying. Get lunch ready. -Sure. Excellent coffee! Thanks a lot, man! Had you not come... ...I would've lost her. -No need for that. Let's go to mom's house. This house used to be bustling with life! That damn Viruman has ripped out its soul! Those damn wretches left my son alone to suffer! They won't have a good life! They'll be ruined! My words will come true! The bell is ringing! -Shut up! Why are you yelling at your mother? Yes, Kuthalam? -Brother... Why did you ask me to call you? Quit talking among yourselves. What's the point of us being here? You are a knowledgeable person, brother. You're well aware of what goes in every panchayat in the region. Must we spell it out for you, brother? No point talking to him! Ask him to leave! If not, he'll leave the world! Go quietly or there'll be trouble! Will you vacate the house or not? Understand where you stand! -Who do you think you're talking to? Don't get all pushy! -Hold up! I'll break your limbs! Stop it! Aren't we forced to have this chat because you signed it away? What are you looking at? You signed away wherever that MLA asked, for your brother's job, right? Then, what? Shut your trap! Brother Muniyandi gave us the power of attorney to claim the place. It's ours now. Don't just stand there, sir! Kick them out, lock this place up and give me the key! Or else, they'll claim we disrespect the law! Viruman thought he was invincible, but we cut him down to size! To make sure this is everlasting... ...our temporary hold must be made permanent. How do we do that, dad? By ensuring Muniyandi is killed. Won't we be blamed? How can that be? Everyone in Theni district is aware of the feud between Viruman and Muniyandi. We'll bump him off. Viruman and his uncle will automatically go to jail. Popping Muniyandi will make our claim permanent and the contract will be settled. How long do we ride his coat-tails anyway? Call Muniyandi! A child's sand house can't be lived in, they say. It was a huge mistake to sign it away without your permission. Forgive me, uncle. You don't have to be sorry. You signed for a good cause. At least you signed for my sake. We blindly signed away for no reason! It's our mother's property. Let's sue that man! Pipe down, brother! We mustn't be as hasty as he is haughty. He only gave them the power. He didn't sell it. What do we do? -No idea. Hello? -Hello, brother. There's a funeral at home. A marquee needs to be set-up. It'd be great if you did it. -Please find someone else. Please don't say that, brother. Workers want to be at weddings, but not funerals. Somehow, please make it. Don't say no. It'll do your father good! I'll be there. The lord is on his way, it seems! Is he now? Let him come! This doesn't look like a place where someone died, Viruman. It's about to turn into one! Two for one! If Kuthalam's son delivers what he promises... I'll turn that power of attorney into an ownership deed. Father and son have stashed him here to do just that! Unaware of that, this moron intends to make that claim permanent himself! How did he become a Tahsildar? Take a look! Whack him! Look at him go! Hold him! Excellent! Excellent, Sembadayan! Your son killed it, Kuthalam! Punch his face thrice! How did he get away? I don't know, dad! Shall I tell you, dear? I was fully aware that if my father knew I was getting beat up... ...he'd drop everything and personally come to watch the show! And there he is! You've saved your father. But how will you save your uncle? You fool! When a mere student can bash you up so much... ...what would his teacher be capable of? How many people did you send? How many people did you send? Where is my father? He took off after the first punch! Don't do it, Muniyandi! Don't! That's enough! Let me go! -You shouldn't drink, sir. Muniyandi... Those buzzards drove my son to the bottle! They'll never prosper! -Don't, sir! That's enough, sir. They are like grown buffaloes. But can't beat someone to save their lives! After inciting his father like this... ...he won't prosper. Those who believe in him will rot too! They'll die in agony! "Die?" Who do you want to die? Had you done your job as a father, would anyone have abandoned you? You keep messing up and you ask him for to die? You too? Touching you is what ruined me! Your life got ruined, huh? Thanks to you, I lost my life! As a father, as a brother, as a father-in-law... As a grandfather... Or hell, have you ever once behaved like a human being? Have you even respected anyone? Who did I disrespect? Slap her! Slap her hard! That's all you know! I avoided you as you were a man who equates slapping his wife to manhood! Then why did you come? I didn't come here to make nice and have a feast! I came to tell a father who revels in his son being brutalized... ...that his son went through that for his worthless father! Who are you sending to beat whom? People can smack my boy by showing love. But if they want to smack him by inciting fear, they can't even go near him! Like an angry man devoid of sense, whom have you ever truly understood? That wastrel Kuthalam who stuck to you like glue? He tried to kill you for your damn wealth! They got you drunk and stashed you in the godown. Had my boy not come in time, they'd have killed you! A dog may not know the difference between a pestle and a Shiva linga! But humans must! What kind of man are you? Kuthalam tried to stab my son in the back! He won't prosper! What happened, sir? -Muniyandi! What's wrong, sir? -Muniyandi, my boy! Start the car, Pandi! Dad wanted to know when we can have my sister's engagement ceremony. First day of the Vaikasi month! Selvam! Selvam! Selvam, my boy! We were discussing something auspicious and you just hard to barge in! What are you doing here? -Quiet, brother. What's wrong, grandma? Sir... With so many fatal ailments, why did you drink? What's the matter now? Both your kidneys have failed! Oh no! What's the big deal? Let's get a transplant! A little money can buy as many kidneys as I want! Money can buy you that, huh? Are you bigger billionaire than him? His own kids wouldn't give him a kidney! Would your kids oblige? There are many things in the world that money can't buy. How can you be so ignorant? Don't worry, kid. You'll get a transplant. My kids refused me because my behavior didn't warrant it. You don't seem like that to me. You've raised your kids well. They'll donate one to you. Don't worry. Sure, we will! After how he betrayed us, look what else he'll lose! Which hospital? Despite being such a large family, what's the point in showing up now? A blood relationship isn't enough for a kidney transplant. The blood type must match! Only then can it be donated and received! I'll test you all. Whichever one matches, I'll operate on them and save his life. Dear boy... He and I can never see eye to eye! How can I wed my sister to him? What, dear? Wondering why all of them are here? None of them are here out of fear or out of lust for our wealth. They're here, bound by the love of one man. Every father wishes he has a good son. But a good man was born as a son to you! Where is my son? As a wife, you're only here to cook. Quit it with this broker business! Wondering why mom got a silk sari and you got a plain one? That's way too generous for a maid. I'm a man. Not just one. I'll screw around with four! You can't question me! Women are just women to men as long as they don't understand them. Once it is grasped, treasures, they will seem like! I couldn't see it thirty years ago. Viruman? Viruman? Viruman? Hey, Bhoogambam! Come what may, Viruman shouldn't escape. Let's burn him with the house. Pour the petrol! Pour it! Two of you pour that side! Pour it all over the house! If he's here, check who's in there! -Okay! Uncle! His father is inside! I won't stop until I kill you and your father! Viruman! -Get up, you! Let's go! -Save yourself! Get up! -I'm not coming! Come on out! I won't! You go! -Get up, I say! Are you stupid? Do you never think things through? I did think it through! My own sister and my wife who trusted me... Must I not feel the pain they suffered because of me? That's why I refused to leave the fire. How much agony must she have been in... ...to look past the pain that comes from setting herself on fire? Must I not feel that pain? If you died, would that solve everything? Even now, you refuse to accept responsibility. The pain of burning is nothing compared to the pain of watching someone burn! Mom died right here. Do you know the pain I was in when I couldn't save her? A kid cries to his mother because his father hit him. But here, a mother cries to her son because his father hit her! In spite of having adolescent kids at home... ...your incessant revels is what made me mad at you! 'Father' isn't just a word. It is faith. Have you ever been a good father? However you look at it... ...I am not a good father. I've always been a bad man. When mom died... When I set out with a knife to kill you... Had uncle not stopped me... ...I would've ended up a bad man too. Mom used to say this. "No one is born bad." "They only live bad lives." "But if they die as bad men..." "the loved ones around them are to blame." My father may have lived like a bad man. But he mustn't die as one. That's what mom and I wanted! You have realized everything and made it here. Now, I'll tell you. I really like you, dad. We can't bear it when someone we like does wrong things! Come here. You made it here. That's enough for me. I wasn't a good father to you. But you've been a good son to me. Forgive me... -Don't, dad... Son-in-law! Seek the blessings from the elders! Yes, uncle. This is the man who raised you. Seek his blessings. You'll always have my blessings, dear. Seek grandma's blessings. She's the elder in our family! Be well! You too, son-in-law. You'll always be well. If my life is an example of how not to raise a son... ...that of my daughter-in-law Muthulakshmi is an example of how to raise a son! Pray to her. Pray to mom, Elango. -Okay, grandma. Pray to her.
