Choujinki Metalder Ryusei Tsurugi, also known as Metalder, woke up after 40 years. He's born to defeat the violence... and evil emperor, Godneros. But Neros Empire had four strong armies. Armored Army, Robotic Warrior Army, Monster Army and Armament army. Their target was to defeat Metalder. Something strange happened in Ghostbank. Armored Army, Victorious Saint Coolgin. Robotic Warrior Army, Victorious Saint Valsky. Monster Army, Victorious Saint Geldring. Armament Army, Victorious Saint Dranger. This is weird. My lord has disappeared. What happened to my lord? Geldring, you dunno anything? Yeah, I dunno. Something is left on my lord's body. I'm the God, Godneros. My lord, where are you? Please come out. I have something to tell everyone. I've fallen ill. I'm worried about Neros Empire. Who can inherit my Neros Empire? I'll let the person who can defeat the empire's greatest enemy, Metalder. Hope my lord will live forever. Neros Empire must have an emperor. The most important thing now is to cure my lord's illness. God in the Heaven! Please use our lives to exchange for our lord's life! In order to battle with Metalder, all of you gotta increase your skills. Yes! Listen up! Listen carefully. Our army must get Metalder's head. Yes, sir! Let's start our first day practice. Yes, sir! Shoot! Accuracy, 60%. Barbery and Strobe, go! Yes, sir! Look! Sorry! I'll catch again. Do you wanna rest for awhile? -Okay. Mai, hide! Oh no! They've found us! Hide here. I'll lure them away. Metalder spotted. Gather at point no.4! Side Phantom Get ready to attack! Surround him! Shucks! I'm stuck! Monster Army, Robotic Warrior and Armament Army have surrounded Metalder. We, the Armored Army, is too slow. Let's attack straight away! Hold on, let's observe first. Yes! Get ready, shoot! Shoot! Shoot! There's a hole over there. I must try it once. Shoot! Cannon! Shoot! There's water. I should run away following the water current. One whole big bunch of people can't defeat him. Look, they've lost. Victorious Saint Sir, let us slaughter him. We've lost to Metalder last time. We must defeat him this time. Okay. Metalder should be somewhere near. Go! Yes, sir! The enemy is somewhere around here. What happened to you? Left punch is to defense the top, center and bottom. Right punch is to attack the enemy. What? The image of Thousand Hands Buddha is recorded in Metalder's battle system! After a detailed analysis, he's learned new techniques. Metalder notices something weird after the cicada sound stops. The enemy is here! Hide! It's Metalder! Hold on! -What are you waiting for? Didn't you figure out that Metalder's defense is perfect? What?! Ikaru! The power inside Ryusei Tsurugi has risen to the top. He transforms into Choujinki Metalder. Metalder, I wanna battle with you! Go to that place to battle! Armored Army, Brave General Tagsky. Armored Army, Brave General Tagsron. I'm Metalder. Attack! Come on! Do you think that thing can stop our sword? You'll know soon. Good! You wanna run away? Metalder uses this pose because he doesn't want the enemy to go to his back. Victory! You think you can with bare hands? I will. Okay. Then use your bare hands to take our sword attack! Brother, now! Chop him, don't care about me! Tagsky! Brother, now! Brother! Brother, I hate this. Brother, let me revenge for you. Metalder can't move freely due to Tagsron. Metalder, you're going to hell. I hate this! Metalder has defeated my army's Brave General Tagsky and Tagsron. Next time, even if I need to sacrifice myself, I must send you to hell. My lord. My lord, I thought you're supposed to resting on your bed? That's a lie. Lie? My lord! Listen up! Four Armies have followed my instruction to work all out to battle with Metalder. But unfortunately, no one has defeated Metalder. All of you have tried your best and I saw that. Understand? Yes, my lord! Let me tell you once again. I'll hand this empire to the person who can defeat that fellow. Wow! Godneros, I swear, before I defeat you, I'll continue to battle even if I'm injured. (The End)
