Welcome to Metro-Optic, one of Montreal's main telecom centres, which is a well-kept secret, a major Internet data centre serving the province and part of Canada. This room is located beneath train tracks in the bowels of Montreal. About 75% of Internet traffic travels through here. Here we have more "private" clients, as it were, with their own exclusive room, who wouldn't want it filmed. So we'll move on. - Who are they? - A government agency? - You can't say? - They... Yeah. It's very private. Of course... the hoodie's a classic. So trite, huh? Anonymous mask, a series of ones and zeros, numbers, hexadecimals... That's often considered a bad thing, a crime, that kind of thing. Not so. There's more to it. There are different kinds of hackers. Some do it for the money, some do it professionally, some do it for fun, some work for the government. There's no such thing as a typical hacker, because there are different kinds. Hackers seen in the movies are just one type. It's important to make a distinction. The pessimist in me thinks the battle has been lost for some time. The mere fact that everyone carries a cellphone, the optimal surveillance device, beyond George Orwell's wildest dreams when trying to imagine an omniscient panopticon. This is also fuelled by social media. I do it, too. Everyone does. Anything that can be monitored is monitored, as well as monetized. And the prevailing business model for all high-tech companies now is the selling of personal information. It remains a cash cow for these companies. And all this is based on data collection, mass surveillance, and the slow but steady erosion of privacy. It's an Orwellian nightmare of sorts. And I think I can help in that regard, through Crypto.Québec, what we produce, with our podcast, articles, training, and what we say to the media. These matters affect everyone, though people may not realize it. They affect everyone, so this must be addressed. Welcome to the 37th edition of Crypto.Quebec's Watchdogs podcast. Hosted by Geneviève Lajeunesse, Luc Lefebvre, Jean-Philippe Décarie-Mathieu, And Sophie Thériault. We have a lot to talk about today. I simply wanted to look back on a little trip we made last week, myself, Jean-Philippe and Luc, to the nation's capital, Ottawa. We visited CSIS and CSE headquarters. - Just to check them out. - From outside. - Well, you tried. - Right. Can you see the building back there? Kinda. I really didn't expect to see Canada's cyber elite across from Loblaws. For real, it's... Imagine... Like, a huge, magical airport next to the Quartier DIX30. - It's kind of like that. - That's exactly it. - With nice bay windows... - It's awesome. Bay windows? Of course. They're all about transparency. There they are. Those who must be stopped. Those who track your aunt's metadata when she goes jogging, because she happens to be related to a person of interest. - They work there. - That's it. I would tell an ordinary citizen that they're the cyber strong arm of the government. To work there is to be part of the problem, really. Because they're really knee-deep in the global surveillance network. I wonder what happens when we reach the no-filming zone. If we don't go beyond the sign, we should be okay. But we will be there in about eight seconds. There you go. - "Breakin' the law." - Story of my life. Wait. The reason we came to the march against police brutality was to see what kind of surveillance was conducted on protesters. Would surveillance methods be more conventional, more technological? So the CryptoPhone is the device that was used in Ottawa when IMSI-Catchers were found. Same device. I think it's highly likely the Montreal Police uses this type of equipment. Here too, I'd wager. This is a warning from the Montreal Police Department. Some protesters persist in breaking the law. Due to offences committed, protesters are ordered to disperse and leave the scene. Otherwise, we will be forced to step in. I'm opposed to the use of IMSI-Catchers, because it not only affects the targeted individual, but everyone within range of the IMSI-Catcher. So everyone around can be overheard, can be tracked down here. There isn't much to see, the readings are not showing anything abnormal. Seems IMSI-Catchers weren't used tonight. For years, the police denied using them. So they were being manufactured and sold, but to no one. They caught me and took my cell! Interesting. The scenario is a thinly veiled parody of North Korea, I guess. Elections are being held in the fictional kingdom of Rao. It's rather unclear. Seems we can either help the regime or the rebels. Now, we're helping everyone to get more points. Rao is basically a fictional character. People will think he's North Korean, but he's really based on Mao, so more Chinese. Everyone okay? What are you working on? Ah, nice! Nice challenge. NorthSec is a somewhat elitist organization. Since the event was launched, we're the first to question people's abilities. They should hone their skills to help, because cybersecurity is about helping people. 30 to 40% of our challenges are won by all teams. So about 60% of them go unsolved by the end of the weekend competition. So people come here because they know they're really gonna bust their humps. They'll really challenge themselves. And it's non-stop. All hail Rao. We can only vote once. All hail Rao. I think most people with NorthSec are against the idea of mass surveillance. Essentially, it's problematic, giving so much information to people who have no business having it. I was what's known as a penetration tester, a professional hacker, in the banking world, for several years. When you work in this field, in cybersecurity, you realize that every scrap of information is a key. The more keys you have, the more powerful you are. And if this information is misused, mishandled, it can become a weapon for many people. So, of course, most cybersecurity experts are troubled by mass surveillance, because they know the stakes. Why do it when it's probably pointless? Surveillance and intelligence agencies already exist. In Canada, we have one with a relatively decent reputation. Why do they need more information? Is it because they're... ...caught short? Or are they simply really lazy? Maybe they're lazy. Subgraph is a Linux-based operating system designed to thwart malicious attacks. There are two kinds of surveillance: Mass surveillance, dragnets; And targeted surveillance. We try to prevent targeted surveillance. There's very little privacy. Even people who are very... shrewd about their Internet usage, their use of technology, even they have very little privacy. Among other things, even if they're careful, someone they know is posting information about them without their knowledge. Foulab is a hackerspace. It's really a collective that offers its members resources, and, above all, know-how. So human capital, in terms of knowledge, for the sharing of ideas and techniques. In hacker culture, access to information is fundamental, in order to understand a system. I call it an open-source think-tank. Now we'll rid this computer of its malicious piece of software. The computer comes with software, which users are usually unaware of, installed by the supplier. For example, the NSA and ThinkPad could have conspired to install software to access the computer remotely. So we'll replace this with open-source software to ensure there's no backdoor, or to simply make changes and change the computer's features. There. I have a copy of the previous BIOS, so I could configure a new one here. So I'll get OpenBIOS or Coreboot. I need to know the ins and outs of a computer, because I can't... BIOS is at the core of a computer. It controls... all functions. So if we don't know how it works and can't guarantee its operation, we can't guarantee the computer's integrity. So you can have the most secure operating system ever, but if the BIOS isn't secure, unfortunately, the rest won't be either. Let me know if you need help. Yeah, Mathieu... if you could... hold it. - Need help? - Yeah. Thanks. It'd be fun - it's been done before - to crack WiFi networks from above. So build a drone that flies over and cracks WiFi networks. Another thing would be - just to prove it can be done - to use an aerial cellphone surveillance device, like that used by the police, known as a StingRay. Essentially, we do this to detect critical flaws in the infrastructure. That's why most people would do this. The issue of what society considers private and public will define our generation. What really worries me is when neighbours start pointing fingers. We may well eventually reach the point where someone could download a program as powerful as a military weapon and use it against their neighbour. Against their spouse, even. That's what worries me most. ...3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ground. A mesh is a distributed network. The idea is to have rooftop antennas to create a network alongside commercial Internet service and connect homes directly. Like, connect neighbours together. I'm kind of discouraged. Honestly. People must change their mentality, but they seem unwilling. They want "ubiquitous computing." They're willing to be monitored by Amazon 24/7 at home through a device, which they can order from at the push of a button. They use Gmail, Google knows their every move, their location, everything. - What they think. - Same with Facebook. They're dominated by computer technology - unwittingly. Even when they know, it's: "I can't do anything about it." Basically, it's a lot easier to monitor everyone when they're in the same room. We're gonna run about 10 feet of cable down. Google, Facebook and the like centralize information, making surveillance easier. If services are distributed, it's more difficult for a hostile party - be it the government or "black hats" - to spy on you. It doesn't prevent targeted surveillance of a particular individual, or even a group, but it makes dragnet surveillance a lot more complicated. Monitoring everyone at once, then targeting someone in particular. Okay, the tester's hooked up. Let's check it again? - Let's do it. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, - 6, 7, 8, ground. - Done. Excellent. It works. It's all good. Great. I'll plug into the wall. The big problem now is that huge corporations, the world's most powerful companies - like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple - their goal now, their lobbying, is geared toward destroying the Internet. Facebook's goal is to replace the Internet... with Facebook. They want you to go on Facebook and stay there. They entice you to stay on Facebook and away from ordinary sites. Google is similar. They... When you use search engines, sometimes you're stuck within Google instead of going to the real site. So there are a lot of forces at work preventing us from re-distributing the Internet and make it the horizontal platform it was devised to be. There it is: Relais.reseaulibre. It's the original version of the Internet. When I first went online in '96, it was free. We didn't pay for Internet access, and... ...Internet access also meant having a web page. That was it, really. It was about checking out your friends' web pages. What did he post? "Hi. I'm Antoine. I play guitar." With a picture of your guitar. People had all kinds of stuff. Then they started sharing increasingly interesting things. And it grew, turning into Wikipedia, into Google, and so on. But it started with someone in their garage. Google started out with a web page. And I've always done that. It's good enough for me. That's it. I don't need to connect with all my friends on Facebook 24/7, know the latest news, the latest opinion, Trump's latest fake news, this and that on Facebook. I don't want to be online 24/7. For me, it's something you turn on, you go online, you're online, then you turn it off and you're offline. I'm not always connected, and I choose when to go online. I call the shots. I'm currently coding... ...what's known as next-generation hidden services. It's being completely re-engineered to improve security. The concept of privacy is extremely important. Increasingly so. If people are being monitored... Today, it's not that people aren't aware of it. They know and accept it. They're not acting in bad faith or ignorant. It's just the new normal. When you know you're under surveillance, unconsciously or not, you change your ways. It really controls society. So the beauty of Tor is, whatever you do online, your privacy is protected to some extent. I requested access to information from the federal government, for all my personal information. They sent me this letter, which basically said: We have your information on file - maybe, maybe not... I'm under investigation. I was kind of proud, because I must be doing something right. I'm doing something useful, and the powers-that-be clearly aren't too happy about it. So it's a vindication of sorts. What's the conference in Montreal about? Okay, we're currently holding our biannual Tor meeting. We invite everyone - staff and the community - to get together, convene, and over the course of five days, we problem-solve, rally, seek to improve Tor. Any particular reason it's in Montreal this year? Yeah, a lot of people refuse to go to the Five Eyes, including Canada. But especially since Trump, I'd say at least half our team refuses to go to the U.S. - Half the team refuses... - Minimum. Can you explain why we can't film the meeting? Right. I mean, these people are for privacy. They don't want to end up on Facebook, have anyone know they came. Some people here literally can't be filmed, because they're coming here at their peril. So, overall, their privacy must be respected. Projects like Tor, like Subgraph, aren't winning. This great surveillance machine is obviously prevailing. Clearly. Of course, there's pushback now. But I think we're 20 years behind our rival, as it were. The forces at work behind this security and surveillance campaign are very powerful. We're talking huge corporations, governments, and so on. So it takes tremendous effort to make a real impact.
