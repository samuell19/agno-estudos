For lack of documents, the so called AFFAIR OF THE POISONS has long remained mysterious. The truth would never have seen the light of day but for the Bastille archives being discovered and published. These archives contain summaries of interrogations and notes taken by Mr. Reynie, Lieutenant-General of the Police. This movie is based on these notes and archives. Some scenes of torture or fanaticism may seem fictitious or excessive. They are strictly in line with reality. HANGMAN AND THE WITCH She'll go to hell! The poisoner! She dies like a saint. She'll go to heaven. Won't she, Sergeant? She'll go where she's told to. Don't push me! She's cute, the lady. A gentleman leads her. The executioner's assistant. Why did you come if you can't see anything? I listen to the noises. And besides I brought the little one. The gentleman is nice. He's holding her hand. He makes her kneel. Mr. de Linieres, I'd like to talk to Mr. de la Reynie. Lieutenant General, you're called. - By whom? - Lady de Montespan. You know I don't take orders from anybody else. - Madame? - You should hasten things. The Marquise of Brinvilliers deserves no pity. I know, I know. But a lady of quality must not burn before the populace. That is true. People would end up developing a taste for it. Executions must be carried out in accordance with custom. Of course, Madame. We will act according to your pleasure. She's now like you. She sees nothing. - But the fire, did they light it? - That's it. - It's smoking. It smokes too much. - It must be chestnut. - I don't see anything anymore. - So shut up, I'm listening. She must dance at her stake. That's is the cry of the condemned. Heard it, son? Yes, father. - What's going on? - People are leaving. It's over, the lady is burnt. They should have taken some oak. It lasts longer. No, no. Wait. Have pity on a poor blind man! Come on, Catherine. This Brinvilliers, you have never even seen her. So why do you put yourself in such a state? And then, for her, it's over now. At this hour, she must already be in the other world. I don't pray for her body, but for her sinful soul. Anyway, it's not your recommendation that will open the doors of paradise for her. Quiet. I pray for us too. So you'd better stay calm. - God won't take care of you. - You pagan! Come on, don't be angry. Look what I brought you. Tarots. Marseille tarots. Real ones. The tarot is a sin. Today I'd like to redeem all my sins. Madame Voisin? I'm not seeing anybody today, I told you. The lady from last night says it's becoming serious. Put them there. I'll look at them right away, in spite of everything. Send her in. - Sit down. - Thank you. No, my child. You can no longer count on me. - Last night, you promised. - Yes, but tonight... No. I no longer wish to sin. - Tomorrow evening? - Then neither. I do penance for two days. But I have to! It's starting to show! Confess to your parents, it would be easier. I've brought all my savings. Couldn't weigh too much. He doesn't help? He's a soldier... And I told him nothing. I'm too scared he would leave me. - I'm waiting for someone. - Madame Voisin... Fine. Come tomorrow night. I will only do penance today. And don't walk around with your savings. At this hour, there are plenty of thieves in the streets. See you tomorrow. - So, did it go well? - Yes. Many people. No, needless to insist. I won't tell your fortune tonight. I don't want to know who you are. If you want, come back another day. Another day? Once again, you didn't come. - You never come to see me work. - I prefer you tell me afterwards. - Everything went well? - With me, always. She did not scream? I made sure that she didn't suffer too much. How? I approached her. I bent over as if to loosen her hair. And then? This way. It was quickly done. You frighten me. But, with you, I like being afraid. - Say, was she beautiful? - Not as much as you are. No, not tonight. - Catherine... - Tomorrow. Executioner, tonight I'll try to pray for you. For me? Executioners don't need prayers. They go directly to heaven. You think so? Necessarily. The servants of justice... There's no nicer man than an executioner, isn't there, Catherine? Which saint could you pray to for me? All guilds have their saint. All except ours. You're wrong. Executioners have their patron too. He's not in the calendar, but will surely appear to you at the Last Judgment. You won't tell me that the executioners' patron would be... Who else do you want him to be? I know you're joking, Reverend. Because of you, I shan't get a wink of sleep. You're wrong to torment him. - He's not a bad man. - I don't like executioners. I also don't like him calling you by your first name. You're in a bad mood today. What happened? We found, in a chapel of the church of Annunciation... We have found a unknown petition filed at nightfall, and that the Jesuits handed over to the police. What does this petition say? That Brinvillier's torture won't prevent poison spreading to Paris. - Woe to us! - That's not all. The anonymous informer announces crimes even more terrible. Good. So, according to you... - that's how the child was kidnapped? - Yes, sir. It was one o'clock in the afternoon. You had finished dinner. You, Gobet, you were in the yard? - Yes, to fix a door. - And your wife? I went to fetch the laundry to dry it. ... to get the laundry... ... to dry it. - How many kids have you got? - Six. - We've had as many as twelve. - Yes, I know. How much do you take from the parents? Depends on the father's job. We love the kids very much. Tell me... - Another one was stolen 8 months ago. - They steal kids everywhere. - Is the Lieutenant-General there? - He's waiting for your report. At the bottom of the still, we found white powder, very light. Exactly like Brinvilliers' powder. Brinvilliers having given her soul to God, I was hoping to finish with these poison stories. Here's a petition found on an altar of the Church of Annunciation. New poisonings are announced, which are nothing compared to other "crimes", - even more frightful. - What crimes? Children are stolen almost every day in Paris. - To sell them to gypsies. - No. I ordered the gypsy encampments to be checked, but no trace. A priest gave me this letter, and disappeared. Not signed. The Lt. General of Police is notified that a strange ceremony, contrary to public order will be celebrated before sunrise in an isolated chapel. I refuse to specify time and place, but I hope this half-confession will help me save my soul which will be this night in great danger. - A fool. - Perhaps. Can you grant me a small place in your coach? I'm going to Saint-Germain to see the Italian dancers. Exactly. Do you want to mingle with the court? To dance? Oh no. I'm going to Pied de biche, a tavern, right in front of the castle. We drink good white wine and we hear very curious things. For example? That tomorrow Mlle de Fontanges will be the King's mistress. You are crazy. I would have been told. You will be. Tomorrow. The coachmen always know things in advance. See you tomorrow, Desgrez. Be careful. It's the 3rd trail on the right. There is a rather dense forest, you go around it. The cemetery is on your left. I'm going to the stables. I'm sure we'll go to hell. I hope so. We'll sit there to the right of the one we prayed to tonight. The client did not deceive us. The sum is there. Still no sharing three ways? As soon as I make my fortune, I will give half to the poor. And I'll hold masses. Real ones. Why pray to God? He is so kind that He always forgives. While the other... You too are afraid of Him? Of course I'm afraid. This is your first watch. Take care to be successful. - Know this ironmonger on the left? - Yes. Be careful. To look to the left, first turn right. It's the first rule of the job. It doesn't matter, Gobet is not there. It was hard to rent, they don't want students. That's right, I'm a student. Come. From here, you can watch the whole street. These people are raising children. Sometimes, one of them disappears. They claim they are stolen. I want to know the end of the story. There he is. Do you recognize him? And his wife. With a priest. You'll try to find out where he comes from, and what he's doing there. Didn't you see Bertrand? - At Pied de biche, with Bernichon. - Bernichon? Mademoiselle de Fontanges' new coachman. Since these poisonings, my wife and I don't trust anybody anymore. At home, I don't drink anymore. I only drink here. Even here, I'm careful. I only drink from this flask. To be Montespan's coachman, it makes you envious. Your reign is over, mine begins. - She's burning with impatience. - My reign is over? I'll sell you my flask. The first time they come, they always hesitate. They only want to leave. I'm used to it. But do not worry, Madame. I never ask the names of those who do me the honor to consult me. I didn't know it was so late. - I'll come back. - Yes, you will. They always do. Only, it is a pity not to take advantage of your luck today. My luck today? The future is a book that can be read only under certain influences. Now we are today under these influences. The sky is divided into twelve houses, which are the signs of the zodiac. I already see your house. It lights up, your house. I see there... Well... a woman. What does she look like? - A little younger than you. - Fifteen years younger. - She thinks herself victorious. - I haven't had my final say. You stop? I ask myself... What? If I couldn't make your future appear in this mirror. - Only... - Only? This kind of evocation is very difficult. I'll pay what's needed. Thank God, I don't need money. But the spirits I'll evoke love jewelry. But if you cast one of your rings in this ewer, it would be dissolved and absorbed at once. That would be the proof that they have told us the truth. - This one? - I'd rather advise that one. The spirits love that we do things well. And now, keep quite still. And look. Look carefully. Him. I see him. I see him rich. If that's not it, stop me. Go on. Powerful. Yes, that's it. He's powerful, isn't he? Yes. - Very powerful? - I don't know. He returns. I see him coming back. He'll never leave you. Prepare for this great happiness. I didn't pronounce any name, just now? I never remember anything, Madame. Who is this lady? You look very cheerful this morning. I have a reason. Guess which? - The King? - Yes. I expect his visit. Today, maybe. M. de Louvois told you? Louvois is a minister, he never anticipates anything. No, I got my information from much surer sources. - Which ones? - The spirits. My disfavor makes so much noise that they talk about it in the other world. I become again the mistress of the Sun King. Open the curtains very wide. I like the sun. This little Fontanges, I do not find her very pretty. - She has freckles. - She only has her 18 years. When she laughs, she giggles. She seems to be a goose. I assure you it was a black mass. One doesn't strangle a child for nothing. - So all those children being stolen? - I believe that's the reason. I'll report to the King after his return from hunting. Beware. Black masses are not held by lower classes. - Can I continue my research? - Everywhere. - It's M. de Linieres. - Let him in, quickly! - Madame! - Talk! Please, talk. You did well not to come. Mlle de Fontanges took the opportunity to imitate you. Once in the saddle she reared up her horse. - Insolent creature. - The poor thing was unseated. - The King will not forgive it. - And disheveled. She'll not speak again. In her shame, she lost her head. She took, guess what? A garter. She fastened her hair with her underclothes. Leave them! Leave them! - A garter... - The court turns away from her. Mr. Clermont-Tonnerre did not greet her. - And the King? - He was still running the deer. I did not wait. I almost killed my horse to bring you the news. We will remember. You will be promoted... Your first squire, Madame. Yes. I dream to hold your shoe in my hand. So be it, I promise you my shoe. La Fontanges, we will see her cry in a convent. We'll give a ball in the evening, they'll cut her hair. Where will we send her? To the Ursulines? No, to the Carmelites. They are flogged three times a week. I feel as if I'm dying. - Wait a few days, that the King has time to return to you. He will never come back. The wretch will surely give him a child right away. And another one right after. That's what I did. It's not funny. Eight times pregnant, you don't know what it is. - Madame... - Oh, yes, it's true. He gave you a little bastard, you too. I don't reproach you. He forgot you right away. He doesn't even recognize you anymore. I don't blame him. Oh yes, it's true. You love him in secret. That's why I can count on you. If I leave the Court, you'll have to pack. You'll never be able to see the King, even from afar. Des Oeillets, am I still beautiful? You know it, Madame. Some women may have magic potions to stay young. Always young. - You seem cheerful today. - Yes, we're going to Monsieur. - Monsieur who? - Madame's husband. M. de Montespan. We are in trouble and need to console ourselves. So you believe that the King is going to be...? That would be his turn, right? - I'll announce you to Monsieur. - No, it's useless. Forgive me for coming without warning, and after so long. Who are you, Madame? Oh yes, I recognize you. You are the King's mistress. You look so much like my wife - that all France thinks me cuckold. - I'm determined not to get angry. What I have to tell you is serious. And me? So you believe that I am not serious? Look at this black suit. - I'm in mourning, Madame. - In mourning? For whom? For my wife, you see! Because she's dead, for me. The Sun King having dazzled her, she died of sunstroke. - Henri... - Because there are two hypotheses. Either I'm a widower, or I'm a cuckold. A Montespan can not be the latter, so I am necessarily widowed. Now, prove me wrong. Your absurdity doesn't surprise me, but irritates the King. You will be ordered to forget the black. - Perfect. I will dress in yellow. - Sir! Besides, you can be proud of yourself. - You married the 1st cuckold of France. - Stop this. You surely know the latest song sung in the streets this week? Le Montespan has two horns So well mounted That the towers of Notre-Dame Are as nothing beside them. The author will be found and locked up in the Bastille. I'll compose others too. The author of these songs is me. You see, this makes me a poet. You're in pain. You care so much about me. You are mistaken, Madame. I don't care for you. It doesn't matter. Grant me a favor, Henri. The only one I'll ever ask of you. Listen to me, Henri. If I'm not a duchess in 3 days, I'll die. And this time, your black suit will make no one laugh. Not even you. Why do you dream of becoming a duchess? For the stool. Only duchesses can sit down on a stool at the royal receptions. The marquises remain standing. - You've already had the King's bed. - I need the stool. The bed, the stool... Definitely, what you like above all in love, is the furniture. Miss de Fontanges is going to be named duchess. A Montespan cannot stand in front of a Fontanges. Get yourself a title too. - I am married. - That's true. I have to wear the title of my husband. Henri... Accept becoming a duke. The King will not refuse me your appointment. Henri... - For old time's sake. - No. I'll never accept anything from this M. de Bourbon. When I'm in his arms, I close my eyes... and I'm still thinking of you. Nobody will know it. Invite me to dinner. No. I won't sleep with the King's whore. Go away. Go away. One third of white arsenic. I said white arsenic. One-third of gray antimony. And the last third... The last third that clears the trace of the two others, it's my little secret. The day you'll know it, you'll no longer need me. And you would be able to send me to prison forever. - She's here. - Who? The diamond woman. A diamond so big that I can't sell it. Next time, take the size smaller. - I want to know her name. - Did you question the spirits? When we know who she is, your fortune will be made too. Lesage, you who have failed to join the police, know all their tricks. - Yes. - I count on you. Forgive me, madam. I was talking to the spirits who take care of you. - Your spirits are insolent. - What do you mean? Here are seven nights that I sleep alone. Your spirits make fun of me. Come, let's not fret. The spirits have no notion of time. A second or a year, it's the same. But, believe me, what they predict always happens. Only, it takes a little patience. I have none. I want victory right away. Maybe it's possible. Come and sit down. - Hey! - Ho there! Ho... It was time, huh? Thanks, my friend. Without you, I'd wake up at Saint-Germain castle. Saint Germain? Damn! You belong to the King's house? Or to a person of the court? - I said nothing. - And I heard nothing. I'm not the Marquise of Brinvilliers. It's not about poison. I refuse to talk about these things. Today, for the slightest thing, they'll send you to the other world. It's so easy. It leaves no trace. No trace, really? Not the slightest. That's why arsenic is so fashionable, for people of quality. It may sound strange, but I do not want that my rival dies. Well, not right now. I want her to witness my triumph. That's just what I wanted to propose. What would you say to seeing on her cheeks and forehead pimples, birthmarks, pustules? It would not be unpleasant. Yes, believe me, there's no more beautiful landscape than a field of pimples on the face of a rival. How wonderful. Explain it to me. It's no big deal, apparently. A kind of jam which you make her swallow, as large as a pea for the lady in question. A kind of jam? She may be silly, but she'll be suspicious. I'll explain to you how to proceed. Invite her to taste a cake and, out of friendship, cut a piece for her and yourself. If the jam is in the cake, I risk eating it too. Calm down. You'll spread it on the blade of the knife. On one side of the blade, of course. See? There's nothing left on the knife. Everything is on this slice. Nothing here. That is true. There's nothing more simple. And, moreover, honest. It's revenge less the inconveniences of sin. God said: "Thou shall not kill", not: "Thou shall give no boils to thy neighbor." I promise to make your fortune. At the first pimple on the whore's face, I'll build you a castle. You are very kind, Madame. You should hate me, though. That's right, your victory over the King incited my jealousy. But the most beautiful loves have an end. Since I must renounce what made my glory, especially as you succeed me. Didn't I introduce you to the King on your arrival? Your success is partly my work. I thought you were imperious... Me? Oh, Ang?lique... Can I call you Ang?lique? - Of course. Do you know that my devoted des Oeillets make pastries? Is it true? - Would you like to taste one? - To taste it only. You are right. Because we must show right away, at the King's table, a strong appetite. The King does not suffer we eat less than him. - It's tasty, isn't it? - Oh yes, it is. If she is a Duchess, this peasant has the right to reverence. - I would refuse. - Me too. - Me too. - Me too. It is done. She is promoted. There she is. I can understand her nerves, but she goes too far. Go away. I was sure it was you. But I wanted to make sure for myself. Take it and go. You offend me, Madame. The honor of serving the first lady of the kingdom is enough for me. Have you been seen here? - Be assured. Nobody saw me. - You might meet someone. I'll say that I came to see a dame de compagnie. Mlle des Oeillets. Des Oeillets, here's a name I won't forget. I regret you did not say yours earlier. The product I gave you will not suffice. All the better. Go now. - Come see me again. - No, I want nothing more. Think it over. May I? For my poor. Trust me. - What? - Nothing. Quick. So? He was right, she lodges at the castle. - Did you see her? - Yes. She's called des Oeillets. She's the dame de compagnie of Madame de Montespan. Erase them all, O Satan, from the Book of submission. And write them down on the Great Book of Revolt. My brothers... the Lord from above sent us a messiah to teach us good. Why did not the Lord from below send us one too, to teach us evil? It's because, my brothers, he wanted us to build first a Church to receive him. And I, who am his humble vicar, will preach in his name the good word. I'll preach you pride, because the proud never give up. Envy, because the envious ones always keep their eyes open. Lust, because it consoles those who are deprived of love. And anger, because it alone gives to the humiliated the courage to overcome the powerful. I have always been yours without knowing. I have always lied, have been always cruel, but I was remorseful. Thanks to you, I will be able to do evil with pride. I killed my lover and my rival. Slowly, with white powders. I like to discourage others, give them bad advice, kill hope. I push people to theft and denounce them. I got two inheritances. And I give nothing to the heirs. And I do harm to animals. I attract cats to my home, dogs, birds... I was ashamed of myself. But it's over. Here, I feel myself first. No one ever did more harm than me, no one! - I do. - Me too! Me too! Me too! No, my brothers! The use of poisons is not the most frightening of crimes. Because there is another one, even more frightful. This is the one we commit when surrendering to despair. When we go, shouting everywhere that the multiplication of the dead announces the end of the world. Rest assured, my brothers, God is with us. But provided that you give up these practices that mix chemistry and magic and sometimes has you make use of these witches and these false priests which abound in Paris. - Another poisoning. - Yes, it's arsenic. - Poisoned. - Who is he? - Misfortune is in the church. - Yes, it's a sign. Another poisoning. - He's foaming. - It's arsenic. Lord, deign to lower Your look at our misfortune and come to our rescue. In the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit. So be it. Good people, stop, because here are some products from the empires of the Moon and the Sun. Come, approach. And take away, for 50 sols only, this wonderful elixir that will de-poison the poisoned. Theriac, the best of the counter-poisons. Sir? Your mistress doesn't love you anymore? Take theriac. She loves you too much? Take some. You are married, single, you have friends, enemies, parents, heirs, rivals, neighbors, in all cases, beware of everyone: take theriac. They told you about Mlle de Fontanges. - Who? - Valets, coachmen? All those you see at Pied de biche? Well, M. Desgrez, knows that she was not poisoned. She didn't drink or eat anything that she hasn't shared with others. So, what do you say? Nothing. Other anonymous letters? I don't read them anymore. Everyone accuses everyone. I know that writing. And that smell... I announce to you that the King himself will not be spared by the powers of evil. He will soon be hurt in his dearest affections. - How is she? - The doctor is there. The fever has fallen. - The doctor is there? - Yes. The fever has fallen. Another 2 or 3 days, and you'll be healed. You'll be riding through the forest of Saint-Germain. It's very simple. I'm fasting a toad. I soak it in a mixture containing arsenic. Then, I whip it. And I collect his drool. All he drank is found in the liquid. But as arsenic has been digested and transformed by the toad, it is impossible to recognize it in the analysis. Ten drops of this product strikes down a man and leaves no trace. What do you think of my invention? The greatest good. But you are wrong to speak of "your" invention, Lesage. The Devil is the great inspiration for chemists. You need only listen to his whispers in your ear. I have already told you, Guibourg. I believe in neither God nor Devil. And I tell you, you are doubly impious. Now, now. I don't know who's right, but two precautions are better than one. While we work, give us a prayer. O my master, listen to me. Give these figures who are about to receive form the power to transmit the humiliation and injury they will receive. That the slightest sting in this wax becomes pain in the heart of the victim. Amen. If this spell fails, ten drops of this product will suffice. It leaves no trace. But you won't need it. This doll will bring you victory. Do not forget to dress it up as your rival. I won't forget. And say the words I taught you. Yes. - What are you doing here? - Me? Nothing. You have a strange look. What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - Three nights you haven't come. Why? Don't I please you? What did they tell you about me? Fortune tellers are always subject for gossip. Yes... It goes in at one ear and out the other. - I trust you. - I hope so. But why forbid me entering when you're not here? I allow you to come to my room. Is that not enough? Yes. Let your eyelids close forever. Let no one ever dare touch you again. Never again. Never again. My God, I know I do ill. I cannot do otherwise. It is stronger than me. We will soon celebrate your birthday. 19 years old... I ordered for you a musical entertainment. A com?die-ballet where you'll play the leading role. They'll soon come to play the music for the show. Come on. Come on, ladies. Ladies, let's proceed. This is our last rehearsal. I'll watch you, but I will no longer speak. There. It's over. Get up. - Miss... - She's so pale. - What's is it, Mademoiselle? - She fainted. She must be tired. Excuse me. You probably know what is in this cup? Muscat wine, I think. At each rehearsal, the wine is already poured. By whom? By a valet charged with the props, as usual. - I don't do that. - Of course. I content myself with playing my character. But why these questions? You think, like me, this fainting is strange? Yes. But everything will become clearer. We'll talk of it again. Lord, let me now find the King's love again. Let his feelings for me become as vivid as they were the first day he met me. - She was 19, wasn't she? - She would have been today. Madame, your dress is a marvel. Yours too, Madame. Feathers, pearls... - One can see that you are sorrowful. - Less than you, madam. Madame de Monaco outdid herself. Yes, but we are wasting our time. The King is inconsolable. Believe me, no man is inconsolable. - What is the cause of her death? - We do not know. But from today on, everything His Majesty drinks and eats will be first tasted by someone else. - M. de La Reynie is announced. - Let him in. I would not have allowed myself to annoy you, especially on a day that is, for the court, a day of mourning, - if... - If? The King has charged me with a mission to you. He asks you not to try to see him, neither today, nor tomorrow. He wants to be able to surrender to his pain. It seems that he was seen crying. Yes, I know, Bourbons cry so easily. In my family, no one has ever cried. No one. Leave and never come back. You will regret it, madame. I accept. - You will not change your mind? - No. - I repeat: a black mass... - I know. You already told me. - It is not God we are invoking. - It doesn't matter. The King closes his door to me. Will the Devil be stronger than the King? It all depends on your prayer. Tomorrow I'll send 1,000 gold coins for your poor. Catherine, I'll tell you a terrible secret. I've thought greatly. I am sure that paradise is empty. - Empty? - Absolutely empty. Men are bad, evil is everywhere. Everybody without exception goes to hell. The best is to be in well with the Devil. Will you get from him everything that this woman asks? When he's called, he answers. But he is wary. If we don't call him from the bottom of our heart, if we refuse to humble ourselves before him, he takes revenge. And his revenge is terrible. There she is. I have never obeyed anyone. This would be the first time. - I refuse. - Our rites are sacred. The priest can say this Mass only if you accept. It would be a disgrace I could never erase. No, I don't want to. You must humble yourself or give up the King's love. And if I uncover my shoulders only? No. You must fully humble yourself. The priest will hold Mass on your body. - Then I would rather go. - Take care. If you leave now, you'll offend him greatly. Come, Madame. You who protect the wicked, do not be deaf to our prayer. Let our voice descend through the darkness of your empire and sound softly in your ears. We beseech you to accept the sacrifice which we will make. We beg you to accomplish the wishes of this woman who lies here, before me. You who have allowed her rival's disappearance, let her find the love once more of whoever fills her thoughts and attach him to her as ivy embraces the oak. In exchange for which she promises you and trusts you with her immortal soul. - No! No! - Don't move! I won't have it! I won't have it! This woman has profaned the ceremony. Demons, insulted, will turn against us. The officers! The police! They burned the chapel before fleeing. Didn't you catch anyone? - We found the usual objects. - And this black mask. Which can give us no clue. I think you're wrong, Desgrez. You'll call Mlle des Oeillets tomorrow at the Ch?telet for questioning. Mlle de Fontanges twice fell ill. The first time, she tasted a pastry that you had yourself prepared. The second, she drank a glass of muscat that you had given her. The coincidence is troubling. Although, you don't suppose that... I don't suppose anything, I observe. - Lieutenant-General... - Let me finish. I had already expected your answer. You will say that if you had wanted Mlle de Fontanges' death, you would have wished the same for Mme de Montespan. And that if Mme de Montespan is still alive, that is proof that you are innocent. Yes, absolutely innocent. You say it yourself. Mme de Montespan is necessary for you to stay at the court. That is the only reason she must remain alive. I swear to you that I am no longer jealous of anyone. For a long time. I have suffered so much... I beg you to believe me. Do you recognize this mask? Yes. It's mine. I am accusing you of having poisoned Mlle de Fontanges and offending God by celebrating black masses. Now you have the floor. That's all? But defend yourself. I have suffered so much... Ask the King, sir. He may remember me. He will tell you that... He will tell you that... I gave in to temptation. I loved a woman to whom I gave a child. I was so afraid of damnation that I have sinned in despair. I seduced the Devil into being my accomplice and torment me less after my death. Though driven out of the Church, I continued to wear this cassock to which I was no longer entitled, the better to rot souls and celebrate the mass of hell. But the spirit of evil is terrible and will never forgive. I hurt him in his pride, and now the black angels are chasing me. They guided the police to me. My God, I who betrayed you not to be burned after my death, here I am going to be burned alive. Now is the time of my atonement. Give me courage, oh Lord, to face Your justice. Who are you? Don't you recognize us? What do you want? What are you doing here? We are hiding, just like you. We are not the only ones. All the churches of Paris, all places that are open at night are full of people who are hiding! The faithful. This church is surrounded, like the others. They have no right to arrest us here. - They are waiting for us to leave. - What will become of us? If we are here, it's your fault! - Because we listened to you. - Now, we'll judge you. And punish you. The rope. They'll understand that we have abjured the Devil. We'll hang him. We'll hang him. We'll hang him. We'll hang him. What do you want? The names of my accomplices? La Voisin, Lesage, Gobet. I will give them all to you. Do not hurt me. It is useless to do harm. So you never went to her place, and she never came to you? I have never seen her. Ever. Well, say hello to each other. I don't know Mademoiselle. For you, it's easier: you don't know anybody and you deny everything. Some corpses in your garden? - Unknown people buried them there. - Exactly. A laboratory in your cellar? Lesage organized everything - without your knowledge. - And he will pay me. Powders in your cupboards? - Customers hid them there. - To harm me. And black masses? Because you wanted to evoke the Devil. If you insist... I'll not contradict you. And you saw him? Well, yes, there. I saw him. And he looks like you. Shut up! Come on, forget what I just said. I promise you to be nice to everyone. As long as no one is unkind to me. Watch your words. I do only this, watch my words. You should thank me, Lieutenant-General. And you, do you recognize her? I recognize everyone. I give all the names. I want to redeem myself. - It's true? - I can prove it to you. You received anonymous letters announcing black masses. - How do you know? - I can recite them by heart. It was I who wrote them. What do you want? One can't do wrong day and night, without cease. It's beyond human strength. Sometimes I felt remorse. - Will you consider it? - We'll see. Speak first. Are you sure it's her? She was wearing a black mask. I recognize her. Yes, I recognize her. She must have a scar, a burn. On her left shoulder. A candle that overturned. It's her anyway. I'm sure of it. More and more sure. Do you recognize him? I ask protection from the King. The name of the King should not be pronounced here. But then, how? How to prove my innocence? The innocent don't cry. I have never seen this man. I don't know what he accuses me of. You won't throw me in jail? No, no! She's right, you're the Devil! I didn't do anything! Enough! Well? She is obstinate, that one. She will confess, still. I know such things. Idiot. In her place, you would confess anything. Stop, I'll talk. I'll tell you everything. Please stop! Stop! Yes. It's me who poisoned Mlle de Fontanges. I confess. It hurts, it hurts! And the black masses, it was you too? Yes, it was me. But free my legs! I'll not be able to walk! Ever! The key to the apartment, the key of the room, the key of the dresser. It's easy. First staircase, first floor, first hall, first door. Beware. Mme de Montespan leaves at 8 pm. The dames de compagnie return at 8:30 pm. You have half an hour to act. Say the names. There is especially one. But if I tell you, clerk, the pen will fall from your fingers. And if you dare to write it, M. Lieutenant-General will burn your minutes, so that no trace remains. I know you, you know. I won't speak to you. Because all I will say... And if you send me to the stake, I will shout it. Yes, I will shout it, that name, to the people, in the Place de Greve! Tell me the name. To me alone, in a low voice. Now that you know, will you release me? Approach, Desgrez. What would you say if someone whispered to you that the culprit could be...? I can't even pronounce her name. You clearly see that the thing is absurd. Why? It's not so absurd. I can guess who made this denunciation. And even the denounced's name. Precisely at this person's place I found this. Did you find this at...? You know that you risk the galleys? Everything depends on you. Oh, I forgot. Here is a ring that belongs to her and that I found the day before yesterday at La Voisin's place. Does anybody know? Send M. de La Reynie in. Your lawsuit leaves you free time? This horrible La Voisin must prevent you from sleeping. It seems that she threatens everybody. Even the most innocent are afraid. Even those she doesn't name. Mme de Soissons leaves tonight. For the Netherlands. Mme de Lessac left for Germany, and Mme de Polignac, who knows. - Why! It's quite a game. - Exactly, Madame. I came to advise you... She said my name? Almost. However gently we treat her, she grows impatient. I'm sure you don't believe a word of what she says. Of course not. Oh, I forgot. I was brought this ring that you must have lost. You see that there are still honest people. Yes. And we will know how to thank them. Don't you think you should leave for some time? A Montespan does not run away. Yes, I think I'm capable of anything. Except to be afraid. Don't accuse me later of not having warned you. You should look at yourself. It's you who are afraid now. Afraid that a scandal will break out, and the King will not forgive you. But rest assured, sir. I have a plan. You? What plan? You'll soon understand. If it succeeds. And it will succeed. If God had created me man, I think I would have been an excellent Lieutenant-General of police. Don't you think? Guibourg? Guibourg? Hey, Guibourg, do you hear me? Do you know who has just come? It's the greatest. Greater than the Queen. She will save us, as she promised. They will pretend to burn us at the stake, and in the smoke, they'll untie us and we'll be free. Guibourg, answer me. It's on her body that you said the Mass, do you remember? It's Montespan. But we must never say her name. Ever. I have to report a serious error I have committed. Mlle des Oeillets has escaped, on the way from prison to the Inquisitional Court. There was a carriage obstruction, I was distracted... Naturally, she took advantage of it. Captain, you will be stripped of your rank. I know. The audience will begin. - So, everything went well? - Very well. - Where is she now? - Rest assured. She'll finally find peace. Woman Voisin, stand up. You have finally confessed your crimes, but you stubbornly refuse to name those for whom you have committed them. Before pronouncing sentence, the court beseeches you to speak. You are found guilty of having distilled and sold various poisons, celebrated black masses, stolen and slaughtered young children. For these reasons, the court condemns you to be burned alive in the Place de Greve, after making amends before Notre-Dame de Paris. Have you anything to add in your defence? No. The sentence is fair. And the earlier it is carried out, the better it will be. - This one too is a witch? - Yes. But she will not do like the others. She will speak. I came for that. To hear great names. It seems that at the last moment, the Devil will carry her away. She's kneeling! Why are you trembling? You know we're pretending. Did you see her, the royal whore? She promised to save me. - In the smoke, they won't see a thing. - Yes. My hair will grow back. Not a word under torture... Not a word on the pyre... Compliments. He's taking a long time to cut her hair. Stop, I'm waiting for the signal. That's it, it's the signal. Tomorrow I'll be at Amboise. Will you come too? No! No! - He's throwing her on the pyre! - Look well. It's the Devil. - She's screaming. - She's going to shout a name! I can't hear, because of the singers! Guillaume! Guillaume! No, I won't, no! No! It's her, it's her! Montespan, bitch! Liar! Liar! Whore! It's her! It's her! It's frightful. If we didn't burn the witches, what would become of us? Let's pray for the peace of her soul. You'll have all the time, Madame. The King wants you to withdraw to the community of St Joseph which you founded last year. The King? I'll make sure of that myself. He no longer wishes you to appear before him. So be it. I'll leave the court, soon enough. Tomorrow at dawn, Madame. That's all I could do for you.
