Mrs. Peterson! Ramon, hey, how's it go’n? How you do’n? There it is, right there on the desk. - Where's she headed? - She’s snow bound, Ramon. - See you went with the pink. - Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a pink day today. I’m gonna have another pickup for you on Thursday. - All right. We'll see you then. - All right. Thanks, Ramon. ♪ Bless my soul What's wrong with me ♪ ♪ I'm itch'n' like a man on a fuzzy tree ♪ ♪ My friends say I'm act'n' wild as a bug ♪ ♪ I'm in love… ♪ Peterson! Peterson! Peterson. - Mr. Cowboy, da? - Da. It's pretty. It's from my wife. Time… rules over us without mercy, not caring if we 're healthy or ill, hungry or drunk, Russian, American, beings from Mars. It's like a fire. It could either destroy us or keep us warm. That's why every FedEx office has a clock. Because we live or we die by the clock. We never turn our back on it. And we never, ever allow ourselves… the sin of losing track of time! Locally, it's 1:56. That means we've got 3 hours and 4 minutes before the end-of-the-day’s package sort. That's how long we have. That's how much time we have… before this pulsating, accursed, relentless taskmaster tries to put us out of business. Hey Nicolai, hey Nicolai, good to see you. How are you, kid? Look what you did. You just delivered your very first FedEx package. That deserves something special, like a Snickers bar and a CD player. And something to listen to, a CD, there. Elvis Presley, 50 million fans can't be wrong. You all recognize this, don't you? I took the liberty of sending this to myself. I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis. You're probably wondering what could be in here. What could it possibly be? Is it architectural plans? Maybe technical drawings? Is this the new wallpaper for the… for the bathroom? It is… a clock, which I started at absolute zero… and is now at 87 hours, 22 minutes and 17 seconds. From Memphis, America to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours. 87 hours is a shameful outrage. This is just an egg timer! What if it had been something else? Like your paycheck, or fresh boysenberries, or adoption papers? 87 hours is an eternity. The cosmos was created in less time! Wars have been fought and nations toppled in 87 hours! Fortunes made and squandered. What? What are you saying about me? I tell them, what do they expect? This man, when his truck broke down, he stole a boy’s bicycle to do his delivery. I borrowed it! I borrowed a kid's bike. And I got my packages delivered, and that is what you people are gonna have to start doing. You have to start doing whatever it takes, because in 3 hours and 2 minutes, every one of these packages has to be on the big truck and on its way to the airport. 15 minutes! - Crunch time! Crunch time! - Crunch time! Let's go! Every package on the airport truck. Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch! - We have a big problem. - What? - The truck in Red Square is stuck. - What do you mean? - It's stuck. - Stuck how? In snow? In ice? What? It's stuck! The most important truck, the Kremlin truck! Many packages. All right, all right, all right. Let's put the table right here. We'll just do the sort. Ah, yeah, a clamp. That would make us stuck. Let's go, unload. Get him out of there. Right here, 2 lines, 2 lines. 1 to the airport truck, 1 to the Moscow truck. Got it? CDG, FE, ME, Memphis on the airport truck. Everything else right there. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock. 4 minutes. Hi, this is Kelly. If you're calling for Chuck, press 1, otherwise leave a message after the tone. Thanks. Hello, Kelly. Are you there? Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. You're not there. You're not gonna believe this. I'm do’n the sorts in the middle of Red Square, in the shadow of Lenin's tomb. ♪ I miss you ♪ ♪ I miss you I really wanna kiss you ♪ I’m outta here in 2 minutes and I’m pick'n up the sweep through Paris. So, I should be back in Memphis about 18 hours or so. That's the good news. The bad news is… I gotta go to the Dentist this week. I got something in there that's hurt'n. I love you and I'm gonna see you soon, and you know what that means. Bye-bye. Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock! I absolutely, positively have to get to Memphis tonight. Can't help you. Try UPS. With this extra head wind, are we gonna be able to push it and make the sort? - We'll do our best. - "Our best," huh? Gwen, is there something wrong with our doctors that Jack here keeps getting certified to fly? - Aren't you concerned? - I'm terrified. But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. That's the spirit. Relentless is our goal. Relentless! What do you expect from the guy who stole a crippled kid's bicycle… - when his truck broke down? - I borrowed it. But I love that the kid's now crippled. So, you missed the last truck by 2 minutes? 2 minutes. Actually, it was less than that. The plane wasn't that heavy. You could've added some fuel, picked up the speed and made up the time. It's about the trucks. Today's truck was 2 minutes late. Tomorrow's will be 4 minutes late, and then 6 minutes and 8 minutes late. - Next thing you know, we're the US Mail. - Yeah, well… All I'm say’n is, if you’d gotten all those trucks on the plane, those Russkies would be walk’n on water right now. Hey now, don't… don't gimme that look. It’s just grape juice, right Chuck? It's like a 1992 full-bodied grape juice. I see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. We'd offer you some but, you know, somebody’s got to fly the plane. Yeah, well, I "just say no,” right? Listen Stan, I've been meaning to ask you. How's Mary? Oh… well, we really don't know anything yet. She went to the Doctor yesterday, and… it hasn't meta… metastasized as far as they can tell right now. It’s just kind of wait and see. I'm so sorry. Tell her I'm gonna come by and see her on my next layover. I want you to know, Stan, we are all thinking about her and you. - And just blessings. - Thank you, Gwen. Hi, this is Kelly. If you're calling for Chuck, press 1, otherwise, leave a message after the tone. Thanks. Stan. Listen… I heard about this… I heard about this Doctor down in Emory, in Atlanta. He's supposed to be the absolute best. He worked on Frank Toretta's wife. Frank Toretta is a Systems Analyst. He played center field for us. You know him. In the softball tournament last Labor Day. Anyway, beside the point. What I was thinking is, is that I could get his number… the Doctor… and… you know, put you all together and… you know, you could get this thing fixed. You could beat it. Thanks, Chuck. So, I'll get his number. - Is Kelly Frears around? - She's copying her dissertation. - You're home. - Home indeed. I love that you're home. Just days before Santa departs on his annual gift-giving venture, he's been declared physically fit to fly. Santa got checked out by doctors at the VA Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. After they declared the jolly old elf in tiptop shape, Santa Claus took off into the wild blue yonder for an early start. In Sarajevo, he spent the day with children, handing out presents and even helping them decorate the special Christmas tree. Santa and a sea of elves took over the floor at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange. Market traders bought Santa hats, donating… The turkeys a little dry, isn't it? - No. - The turkey is perfect. - How many did you do last night? - Last night? 2.9 million. Now you've got to be in the market for more of these candied yams. Here you go. 2.9 has got to be the record. Look at those marshmallows. When I was there, we did 2 million. - We thought that was a big deal. - The glory days. - What'd they do the first night? - The very first night? - 12 - 12 thousand? - Hell no, 12. - That's right. And they did the sort right there on a card table. And Fred Smith had that card table bronzed. I've been hearing that for 5 years. - It's in his office today. - They go from that to the new hub up in Anchorage. It's state of the art, a perfect marriage between technology and Systems Management. Speaking of marriage, Chuck, when are you gonna make an honest woman out of Kelly? - How long? - 14 minutes into the meal. - You won, I owe you $5. - So I win. - Way before the pie. - I told him on the way up. Right about the time the pie came out, the marriage… Kelly is still recovering from her failed relationship with that parolee. He was a lawyer. I knew it had something to do with raising your right hand and swearing to tell the truth. Remember when he fell on the sidewalk and broke his shoulder at the wedding reception? He tripped on a curb holding a door open for me. - Aunt Kelly was married before? - It's not even worth remembering. So, since her failed marriage to the parolee… - Oh, my God. - Kelly can't see being with a man who wears a pager to bed. What're you gonna attach it to, Hoss? When you wear it to bed, I hope you got one of those things that go vibrate'n. Watch it. I'm not touching that. Oh, did you hit an olive pit? - I thought I took all of them out. - No, no, it's not that. - Okay, I'll cancel Saturday. - No, don't. If I'm not here, I'm not. But if I am, well, - then I am. - It's canceled. But you gotta be here New Year's Eve. Malaysia can't be that bad. I'll be here New Year's Eve. - When are you defending your dissertation? - January 12. All right. I'm gonna have to switch over the South America thing. If I do that on the 3rd or 4th, I'm gonna have to head back out on the 13th. So long as you're here New Year's Eve. I will be here New Year's Eve, I promise. - What? - What about our Christmas? I got a gift for you. We have to do it in the car. ♪ You'll be doing all right ♪ I’d just like a minute over here, all right? Thanks. ♪ But I'll have a blue ♪ - ♪ Blue, blue, blue Christmas… ♪ - 2 minutes, okay? 2 more minutes. Thanks. Hey! - Merry Christmas. - I thought you were gonna stiff me. - No. - What is the ribbon? Is it a 1,000-pound - test fishing line or something? - Here's your fancy thing. Thanks. I love the wrapping. - And I love the box. - Good. Oh. Oh, my. Oh, that is terrific. My Grandaddy used it on the Southern Pacific. Hey, I took this. This is my favorite picture of you. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm always gonna keep this on Memphis time. Kelly time. You haven't said anything about your presents. Is there a problem 7 I'm sorry, no! I love 'em. Look at my journal. Ah! - What about the pager? - Real leather. The pages have gold on 'em. - Did you like the pager or not? - Yes. I love it. Look at him in his little blue Russian house, there. - It's from Russia. - My God! - It's not one of those loud ones? - No, you can program it so it vibrates and lights up and see it in the dark. It seems like a real nice pager. - Sorry about the hand towels. You're hard to shop for. - No, no. I love 'em. - Every time I wash my hands, I will think of you. - All right, I gotta go. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - I love you. - I love you too. Chuck! Keys! - Thank you. - That reminds me, I almost forgot, I have one more present for you. Only this isn't an "open in the car” kind of present, like, say, hand towels. Which were a joke, by the way. I'm terrified. Just take it and hold onto it, and you can open it on New Years Eve. And I love you. I'll be right back. Hey Al, where are we? Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. Ha, ha, ha!

I… have made fire! You gotta love crab. In the nick of time too. I couldn't take much more of those coconuts. Coconut milk's a natural laxative. Things that Gilligan never told us. Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson? So… Wilson. We were en-route from Memphis for 11 and a half hours. About 475 miles an hour. So they think that we are right here. But… we went out of radio contact and flew around that storm for about an hour. So that's a distance of what, 400 miles? 400 miles squared. That's 160,000… Times pi, 3.14. 502,4… That's a search area of 500,000 square miles. That's twice the size of Texas. They may never find us. This tooth is just killing me. It started out just hurting when I bit down, but now it just hurts all the time. All the time. It's… it's a good thing there's not much to eat around here, because I don't think I could chew it. lust keep sucking on all that coconut and all that crab. And just think, I used to avoid going to the Dentist like the plague. I put it off every single chance I got. But now, oh, what I wouldn't give to have a… a Dentist right here in this cave. In fact, I wish you were a dentist. Dr. Wilson. You wanna hear something funny? Back home in Memphis, my Dentist's name is Dr. James Spaulding. She's much prettier in real life. Shut up! "Bakersfield?" Bakersfield! This could work. This could work. 22… 44… lashings. 44 lashings. So… We have to make rope again. Wilson, we're gonna have to make a hell of a lot of rope. 8 lashings of these structurals. That's 24 apiece. That'll be 100… 160… Here we are today. That gives us another month and a half until we're into March and April, which is our best chances for the high tides and the offshore breezes. We need… we need 424’ of good rope, plus another 50’ say, for miscellaneous. Round that off to 475’ of good rope. Now, if we average 15’ a day… Plus, we have to build it, we have to stock it, we have to launch it. That's gonna be tight. That is not much time. But we… we live and we die by time, don't we? Now, let's not commit the sin of turning our back on time. I know. I know. This is it. That's all that's left. I checked over the whole island, and that is all that's left. So we're gonna be short. Short. We'll just have to make some more out of the videotape. Yes, no, we have time. We do. We have time. Look! The Wind's still blowing in from the west. I know! Yeah, I know… I know where there's 30’ of extra rope! But… but I'm not going back up there. There, there. There, you see? Huh? There, are you happy? Do you have to keep bringing that up? Can't you just forget it? Huh? You were right. You were right. It was a good thing that we did a test, 'cause it wasn't gonna be just a quick little snap. I would have landed on the rocks. Broken my leg or my back or my neck. Bled to death. But it was the only option I had at the time though, okay? It was what, a year ago? So let's just forget it. And what is your point? Well, we might just make it. Did that thought ever cross your brain? Well, regardless, I would rather take my chance out there on the ocean than to stay here and die on this shithole island, spending the rest of my life talking to a goddamn volleyball! Shut you up. Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Wilson. Oh, God! Wilson! Wilson! Never again. Never again, never again. You're okay. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I know you. I know you. I know you. So, we okay? Okay? You still awake? Me too. You scared? Me too. Okay, here we go, Wilson. You don't have to worry about anything. I'll do all the paddling. You just hang on. Not yet! Hold on! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Stand by, Wilson! Hold on! Hold on, Wilson! I think we did it! I think we did it! Wilson! I think we did it! Oh! They're gone! I don't know why! Where's Wilson? Wilson, where are you? Wilson! Wilson! I'm come'n! Wilson! Wilson… Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! I’m sorry! I'm sorry, Wilson! Wilson, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Wilson! I can't! Wilson! I'm… I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Kelly. Kelly. Hello? Oh, how are you? Okay. 45 minutes. 1 Dr. Pepper. 2 cups of ice. I like ice. Well, here's the drill. Plane pulls in, we get off, and there's a little ceremony right there in the hangar. Fred Smith will say a few words. All you have to do is smile and say "thank you." Then we'll take you over to see Kelly. She's actually gonna be there, huh? Well, that's what we have arranged. I mean, if you’re sure you wanna do that. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes. I don't know what I'm gonna say to her. What in the world am I gonna say to her? Chuck, Kelly had to let you go. You know? She thought you were dead. And we buried you. We had a funeral and a coffin and a gravestone. The whole thing. You had a coffin? What was in it? Well, everybody put someth’n in. You know, just a cell phone or a beeper, some pictures. I put in some Elvis CD’s. So you had my funeral… and then you had Mary's funeral. Stan, I'm so sorry I wasn't around when Mary died. I should've been there for you, and I wasn't. I'm so sorry. 4 years ago, the FedEx family lost 5 of our sons. That was a terrible and tragic day. But today, one of those sons, Chuck Noland, has been returned to us. Chuck, welcome home. Just moments ago, Fred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland. - How about it, Michelle? - It's such an incredible and amazing story... - to come back from the dead. - Well, it's so amazing that Smith himself welcomed him back. And Fred acknowledged that, “While time waits for no man,” “we take time to pause to honor one of our own.” Now, that's an expensive pause. I'm… I’m sorry. I must be in the wrong place. No, you're in the right place. You probably don't remember me. I actually did root canal on you about 5 years ago. Jim Spaulding referred you. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Kelly's husband. Jerry Lovett. Kelly wanted… Kelly wanted to be here… Look, this is very hard for everyone. I can't even imagine how hard it is for you. Kelly… she's had it rough. First when she thought she lost you, and now dealing with all of this. It's… it's confusing. It's very emotional for her. She's… she's… sort of lost. Maybe you could just give her a little more time. Anyway… I'm sorry that… Okay people, let's go. Party's over. Let's go home. Let's go home. You're definitely gonna have to go down to the DMV. Okay Maynard, let's go. Chuck's had a big day. - I have to brief this man on his meetings tomorrow… - I know. With the accountants and the attorneys, all right? I will see you bright and early in the morning. - Hey Chuck, welcome home. We love you. - Becca, I need to speak to you. You know Chuck, we gotta catch up on some of that fish'n, now. Take care. - Good night. - Good night. You got everything you need? Okay. Well, if you need anything, just sign for it, and I'll see you in the morning. Get some sleep, okay? We got another big day tomorrow. It takes a lot of paperwork to bring back a man. - Bring you back to life, man. - Bye, Chuck. - Take care, now. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow we're gonna bring you back to life. How long are you gonna be, man? Well, - how long will that buy me? - About 10 minutes. I'm awake. I saw your taxi drive up. Get in here out of the rain. I saw you down at the hub today, So, I know you were down there. Let me get you a towel. They're sleeping. If you come in, I'll make you some coffee. It's a nice house. Yeah, we got a nice mortgage too. What's your daughter's name? Katie. Katie. - She's a beautiful little girl. - She is a handful. just let me get one thing straight here. We have a pro football team now, but they're in Nashville? Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay. They used to be in Houston. First, they were the Oilers, and now they're the Titans. The Houston Oilers are the Tennessee Titans? But that's not all. They went to the Super Bowl last year. - And I missed that. - You would've died. It was so exciting. They almost won by 1 yard. 1 lousy yard right at the end. I got whole milk, 2% and nonfat. I don't have any half-and-half, and that's what you like. That'll do fine. What happened to you becoming a professor? You're not Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett? When you… when your plane went down, everything just sort of got put on hold. I think about taking it up again, though. I came out here to give you this. Oh, my God. I'm sorry it doesn't work. And I… I kept the picture. It was all faded anyway. I want you to have it. I gave it to you. That's a family heirloom, and it should stay in your family. That's everything I have from when you went down to now. They said they never figured out what caused the crash. Probably some mislabeled hazardous material caught fire. So here's where that ship found you. You drifted about 500 miles. This is where your island was, about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands. And these are the search grids. Ships went back and forth for weeks looking for you. I never should've gotten on that plane. I never should've gotten out of the car. I wanna show you something. Come here. This is… this is our car. You kept our car. All right, now, this is weird. It's a good car. Had a lot of memories in this car. 2 very nice memories. Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah. So, can I drive it? It's your car. That's good, 'cause my… my taxi's gone. Let me get some stuff out of the back. You think you’re gonna have more kids? I don't know. It's kind of confusing right now. Well, you should. I mean, really, you should. I would. So, what now? I don't know. I really don't know. You said you'd be right back. I'm so sorry. Me too. Chuck! Chuck! I always knew you were alive. I knew it. But everybody said I had to stop saying that… that I had to let you go. I love you. You're the love of my life. I love you too, Kelly. More than you'll ever know. Chuck? You have to go home. We both had done the math, and… Kelly added it all up. She knew she had to let me go. I added it up, knew that I'd… I'd lost her. 'Cause I was never gonna get off that island. I was gonna die there, totally alone. I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was gonna get injured or something. The only choice I had, the only thing I could control was when and how and where that was gonna happen. So, I made a rope. and I went up to the summit to hang myself. But I had to test it, you know? Of course, you know me. And the weight of the log snapped the limb of the tree. So, I… I… I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to. I had power over nothing. And that's when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket. I knew, somehow, that I had to stay alive. Somehow. I had to keep breathing, even though there was no reason to hope. And all my logic said that I would never see this place again. So that's what I did. I stayed alive. I kept breathing. And then one day that logic was proven all wrong, because the tide came in, gave me a sail. And now, here I am. I'm back, in Memphis, talking to you. I have ice in my glass. And I've lost her all over again. I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly. But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island. And I know what I have to do now. I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow, the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring? ♪ I gave a letter to the postman ♪ ♪ He put it in his sack ♪ ♪ Bright and early next morning ♪ ♪ He brought my letter back ♪ ♪ She wrote upon it ♪ ♪ Return to sender ♪ ♪ Address unknown ♪ ♪ No such number ♪ Hello!
