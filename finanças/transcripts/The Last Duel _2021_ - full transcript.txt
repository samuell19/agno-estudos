Based on real events Turn to your right, milady. Thank you. There you go. Listen, listen, listen! Lords! Knights! Squires! And men of all kinds! By the command of our sovereign, King of France, is strictly forbidden... ... under penalty of death and loss of property, that everyone here be armed, to have a sword or a dagger, unless he has express permission... ...of our sovereign, the King. Every man must fight, on horseback and on foot, the way he likes it, with any weapon or means of attack or defense. Except weapons or means of the same kind... ... or made with charms or spells, or any other forbidden thing by God and the Holy Church all good Christians. If any of the combatants brings to the battlefield any spell-crafted weapons, charms, incantations or any other evil arts, so shall he be punished as an enemy of God... ... or as a traitor... ... or as a murderer. Tighter. Tighter. Gentlemen, begin! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come to your battle! You will all die! You'll die like pigs! Come on! Come on, you fools! We can't stay here. And fight! Jean, Pierre ordered us to defend this bridge. Give them damn orders! For the king. To the king! To the King! Thank you. I won't apologize for the way you fought today. It was an honor to be there with you. Limoges is lost. And our allies failed to take the port of Brest. Our new senior, Pierre, has abandoned the campaign and is sending us home. We leave at dawn. There, there. To the king! Clearly, Pierre is not happy. Lives have been saved. Not in Limoges. Let's go home, my friend. You saved my life today. Thank you. Name! Scutier Jean de Carrouges. Son of the captain of this fort. Open the gates! It's a great honour that Pierre chose your father's castle for the ceremony. I'll be ready to take over the captaincy upon my father's death. Many years from now, I hope. Dad. Mother. Captain. Milady. Squires. Don't leave our master, Pierre, wait. ...I become your man. I serve you for life. My lord, I become your man. I swear to serve you for life. My lord, I become your man. I will serve you for life. Milord, I'm becoming your man. I swear to serve you for life. My lord, I become your man. I swear to serve you for life. - My lord... - Closer. Master, I become your man. I swear to serve you for life. Name! It's me, Helen of Troy. Le Gris. Good to see you, my friend. Although I'm not just coming as a friend. I'm afraid my visit has another purpose than I let on. Speak! Pierre commissioned me with debt collection. I understand. I've already visited everyone else on his domain. And now... You came to me. I came to you. These dues are for military defense. You know as well as anyone that the enemy is present. And we must be prepared. When I wasn't ready to fight for my king? You were. More than any other. But that's not all Pierre wants. No, what Pierre wants... Pierre wants the money that is rightfully his. I don't have it. The plague took half my people. Rent collection is down. - My fields produce half... - And the cost of labor has gone up. Yes. - How did the other vassals pay? - They paid because I had to insist. I understand. And now you're insisting on me? Let me talk to Pierre. That's reasonable. I'll explain your situation. You're a true friend. But I can't go back empty-handed. Of course not. Thank you. Let me see what I have on hand. - Think about it! - I have. No, you didn't. I will fight under command of Admiral de Vienne. The English are plundering Cotentin Peninsula right now. This plague has taken your wife and son. I won't stand idly by while Lower Normandy falls. You have no heir. If you die, everything you have will go to Count Pierre. Something that doesn't escape Pierre, I'm sure. He doesn't favor me like you do. - You have a lot to live for. - What do I have to live for, here? A name. He's too famous to treat with such recklessness. Your father is a captain in Bellême. When he dies, you will inherit the garrison, with everything it has. And I'm your friend. And there are many others like me who'd rather not die. I'm not starting this campaign recklessly. I'm not doing it just to fight. Then why? Jacques. I'm... ... broke. I need money. NORMANDY Long live the King! Long live the King! - They're back! - Hurry! Come on! They're back! - I'll take that. - I'll help you, sir. Turn around, please, my lord. Raise, raise your arm! Give them more bread! Here. They want more. Robert de Thibouville. They give us shelter and food. De Thibouville? Wasn't he on the English side against us at Poitiers? Yes, but he was pardoned along with the others. He's with us now. And that's the way it's going to stay, if he knows what's good for him. Easy, Jean. It's a roof over our heads. Besides, has quite a wine cellar. What a beauty! Is it a de Thibouville? Yes. Her name is even older than yours. She's his only daughter. There is a dowry. Naturally, the man should wear her father's mark of shame. I can't imagine she'd suffer much with the task of making an heir. Gentlemen, welcome! You fought bravely. Thank you for hosting us. - I'd like to introduce him to you... - Jean de Carrouges. Your reputation precedes you. So does yours. It's my pleasure to host you. It's only right to support people who fight for the king. Some lessons are learned later in life. Let me introduce you to my daughter. Marguerite. Marguerite, this is the squire Jean de Carrouges. Milady, I'm pleased to meet you. My pleasure. The dowry includes this parcel. Starting from the hunting grounds. And this one here? The one to the north? Aunou-le-Faucon. As I said, starting from the hunting grounds. I'll have that piece of land too. Sure. Amen! I'm a very jealous man, milady. Tonight, you are mine and you will dance with no one else. And every night after that. Don't worry. That's it. The field starts at the mouth of the river and stretches to the hill there. So this is Aunou-le-Faucon. He was supposed to be part of Marguerite's dowry. She liked it here. And Pierre gave it to you. In gratitude for serving him. His accounts were a mess. Once I reordered them and collected the debts owed, everything started to go right and he got his fortunes back. He gave me this as a token of his gratitude. It's not my doing. The Count is generous and impetuous. Let's eat! I wish I'd seen the gardens of Aunou-le-Faucon. We had roses and lavender. Then we'll have some here. I remember my father made a swing on the biggest tree in the field. I'll find the biggest tree and do the same thing. I have such beautiful memories of summers spent there. It's a pity Pierre took that estate from your father. I know you miss him. It was the only way he could pay what he owed. Pierre then gave it to her to Jacques Le Gris as a gift. All the squires rejoice such generous gifts? I'm graying them more than most. Became the most trusted Pierre's man. Maybe Aunou-le-Faucon is not lost forever. Maybe I won't leave it at that. Jean... My love, I bled for this king. He knows about me. - Maybe I have more power than you think. - I know how strong you are. This land was promised to me as part of my wife's dowry. The petition is denied. The decision comes directly from His Majesty the King. Are you Squire Jean de Carrouges? I am. What does it say? It's your father. Open the gate! Open the gate! Leave us! I was in Paris when the news came. Your father died peacefully. In his sleep. I'm lost. I'm told that I'm forced to leave here in a month. You'll do no such thing. I will take over the captaincy. You will keep your rooms, your servants. Everything will be as it was. Jean, haven't you heard? You're not gonna follow in your father's footsteps as captain of Bellême. What do you mean? Why did you have to sue him the count for a piece of land? Just to impress your bride. That land was promised to me. It was an appeal. And now you've made an enemy in Count Pierre. It was right. Straight. There is no right. There is only the power of men. You sued him and made a powerful enemy. Your father was a hard man, but he understood a lot about this world. Then who will take over my father's captaincy? Good day! Join us, squire! It's a holiday. I will not stay, my lord. I don't want to interrupt such an opportunity, but honor compels me to speak. I was angry, but I spoke well. I told Pierre: "You can sit there like a man of honor, as my senior," "and tell me I'm not man enough to assume my rightful captaincy," "that my grandfather and my father had for the last 20 years of their lives" "and take command of the garrison and hold Fort Bellême for my king?" - And what did Pierre say? - And there was Le Gris... ...whose life I saved, by sitting next to him, with his captaincy, not even having the courage to look at me. He poisons my lord with devilish advice. Whispers in his ear, he stains my name. I'm sure you didn't say that. You said it. We're no longer welcome in court. Jean... Fie! ONE YEAR LATER Milord. Jean, an invitation has arrived. Your friend Jean Crespin has invited us to his home. Celebrating the birth of their first child. It's a boy. Wonderful news. It's been a year since Bellême. Maybe we can show our faces, so they know we're getting on with our lives, despite this injustice. A healthy child in these times is cause for celebration. You think I'd deny the Argentan mob the sight of a true noblewoman? Order a dress! This one's ready. We need more hay here. I'm so glad you chose to come. This will do you good, my love. Jean, I'm very pleased to see you. It's been a long time. Congratulations, my friend! - Milady, you look lovely. - Thank you. Please, you're welcome. Excuse me, milady. - Le Gris. - Carrouges. Peace! Bravo! Well done! Let there be no ill will among the king's servants. - He needs us all now. - He does. Well said, old friend. Marguerite, come! Give our friend a kiss and show him the good faith of the house of Carrouges. I'll be back in a few months, my love. I'll be safe and well taken care of by Alice and your mother, but I will miss you. That's my job. - Let me take care of you. - What about you? I have everything I need. Except an heir. My love. It comes with God's will. I call you knight in the name of God. Get up! Jean de Carrouges! In honour of your service for our king. Silence! I call you knight in the name of God! Get up! All right, people! Prepare for battle! SCOTLAND Sire? Why are they running away? Why am I running? To the king! The master returns! Coming! The master returns! The master returns! The master returns! Here he comes! Welcome back, sire! My lord, you are not well. This fever is all I brought back from that miserable place. As well as knighthood. Tomorrow, I have to leave for Paris. - I'll be gone for a week. - What do you want? The treasurer owes me money. - Jean, you're not well. - It's good enough to travel. To Paris? That's three days of riding. And Argentan. Duty calls to report to Pierre. They will admire you as a knight. And you will hate those who who didn't expect you back, Sir Jean. Sir Jean de Carrouges? Signature here. 300 gold coins. Sire. I'll be in my room. Good night! My love? What is it? Did mom fight with you again? No. I missed you. Didn't you miss me? - You have no idea how much! - Then let's go to bed. What? What is it, my love? While you were away, it was a day... ... when your mother had business in Saint Pierre. Yeah. She took the servants with her and I was left alone. She didn't leave Alice? I told him very firmly. He took all the servants. Shortly thereafter, a man came, unannounced. I knew him, so I let him in. But he wasn't alone. He attacked me. He pinned me, I protested. I screamed, I shouted as loud I could, but there was nobody here. He obeyed me. I couldn't do anything. I was raped. Who? Who did this? Who? Jacques Le Gris. Are you telling me the truth? Yes. Yes. - Are you telling me the truth? - Yes, it's the truth! You have to believe me! You must. You're my girlfriend. Come on! I wasn't here to protect you. Please forgive me. Please. Jean. I want him to pay for what he did. And he will pay. Will pay. Gather your swords! Lead them in, please! Take the horses! Get them out of the way! Take them inside, please! So I'm asking for your help. Marguerite is my wife and she was dishonest. - I won't allow it to go unpunished. - Your only way is through Pierre. Though I doubt he'll grant you an audience. Tell the story you heard today. Wherever you can and to everyone who will listen. We will be the subject of gossip. If the story is known throughout Normandy, Pierre will have to to grant us an audience. I have a plan. I demand a duel to the death. This custom has been removed outlawed years ago. Not so, Your Grace. It's true that he didn't keep a duel in your lifetime, although it's still acceptable as a way of... It will be necessary to convene parliamentary body in Paris. All 32 members of Your Majesty's court. One of us lied. Let God decide. Sir Jean, if you lose this duel, thus proving the charges false, your wife would suffer dire consequences. God will spare those who speak the truth. And the truth will triumph. I'm not afraid. Excellent! PALACE OF JUSTICE Her Majesty, King Charles VI! What business do you appear before this court? Most high and mighty king, and our sovereign lord, I present myself. Jean de Carrouges... ... knight... ... as plaintiff in your court... ... and I charge this squire of the most wicked deed against my wife, Lady Marguerite de Carrouges. I accuse him that in the third week of last January, the same Jacques Le Gris... ... illegally and carnal dishonored my wife against her will, in our home. And if this Jacques Le Gris denies his crime... ... I'm ready to prove my accusation with my body against his body and leave him breathless at an appointed time. Come to your fight! You will all die! You'll die like pigs! Come on! Come on, you fools! We can't stay here. And fight! Jean, Pierre ordered us to defend this bridge. - Give them damn orders! - I'm baiting you, Jean. They want us to leave the bridge so they can take Limoges. Then they'll get their wish! - My son is a fool. Let him go! - If he goes alone, he will die. To the king! To the king! I know he's stubborn. Yeah, stubborn, difficult, jealous... - ... impetuous, foolish, irritable, foolish... - Yes. I know, my lord. ...stupid. He doesn't pay his annuities on time. But I consider him a friend. He didn't listen to me and let Limoges fall. He thought he was going to make it. His intentions were good. It's no fun at all. You mean you'd like to see him again the moor here in Argentan? He's sulking like a black cloud. My lord, I fought him and I've seen the worst of the world with him. He is loyal. Yes. So are my greyhounds. As you wish. Go! Do what you want! I have a very bad impression about his character. But a very good one about yours. It's the quality that makes you the greatest honor. But don't let loyalty blind you. - Thank you, my lord. - Yes. Le Gris? Golden? Or sandal? - Gold. - Indeed. Golden. CASA LUI PIERRE D'ALENÇON No, no, I know, I know... Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen... Under ordinary circumstances, your host, the Viscountess, my wife, Lady Marie Chamaillart, would catch the sunrise with all of us... ... would sing louder, dance more and get you all under the table. Yet he toils growing up our eighth child, of our 14 years of marriage. Good night, dear friends. I won't wait for any of you. Especially my husband. Good night, my dear! My love. There, there! Good night! Well, now the evening could begin in earnest. Where were we? Latour, read! - I don't know Latin. - You don't even read. I'll read the book of love. Rule number 24. Does anyone know? Scutier? "A new love expels an old one." Too true. Well, it looks like we have a squire with a hidden talent. Read! Love rule number four. "Love always grows..." "... or weakens." You insolent bastard! He knows you. "Nothing prevents a woman from being loved by two men." "Or a man from being loved by two women." Well read! Go, go! If you run, I'll just follow you. It's getting serious. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! This client is tough. No! And strong. Come on, get a river in you. Pierre! Come on, Pierre! Great! Pierre. Pierre. Life is good. The wolves didn't sleep either. Your wife will be awake soon, my lord. You'd better be there. Pregnant and hysterical. I'd rather take my chances with the wolves. Tell me, squire, how can a man of war become so learned? I was born without a name and without fortune. I prepared for a life in the church. The requirements... ... didn't suit me. No, no. A libertine after my own heart. That always came easy to me. Does this knowledge apply to numbers? Yes, my lord. Then I'll share something with you, and it stays between us. Of course. My accounts are in disarray. Would you mind using your knowledge to help me adjust my finances? How is that possible? The payments are late. Accountants are sloppy. Milord, these nobles keep the money they should be paying you. The plague has killed half the workforce. Crops are low, labor costs are up. I understand the numbers, and absolutely nothing of any of this concerns you. You have to be prepared to squeeze an army on a moment's notice. That's not possible if you don't have the money. And when I say they don't have it? Let them tell me! Okay, then. I was trying to talk to your master. This matter is between us. Don't interrupt me again. Let's look at the map! Okay? I have the property here in Bourg. No, my dear. No. What's this here? Aunou-le-Faucon. No. It's one of the most valuable of my fields. It will be part of my daughter's dowry. I can't give it to her. My friend, Pierre doesn't ask you to give him your best domain. But Aunou-le-Faucon is worth twice what I owe. Think how good it'll feel not to owe anything. Did you hear that? Reports from the north. They say there's a father so desperate, that he will marry off his own daughter to Jean de Carrouges. Is that so? Yes, Robert de Thibouville, the traitor. Carrouges needs an heir. Is she the only noblewoman in Normandy? She also needs money. She has many merits. She's rich, young. They say she's beautiful. Yes, and her father betrayed the Crown. I make no apology for Robert de Thibouville. Yes. Too bad he wasn't beheaded for his treachery. He would have been spared that humiliation. Easy! Yes. Here, boy. Deer blood. Badge of honour. Badge of honour. Well done, Etienne! Charles. What? He's suing me. Get in! Take off your pants. He's suing me! - Who? - Me! For a rightful land of my own. Jean de Carrouges has filed a lawsuit for a property. Why would he sue you over a piece of property? Because you gave it to me. She's suing you too. He's suing both of us. I don't see what's funny, my lord. How do you sue for something that was never yours? My shield. Now you admit I was right about Jean de Carrouges? He says he will take the matter to the king. He bled for this king. My cousin, the king. Pierre. I bled too. So did you. My friend, this problem is solved. I was hoping to surprise you in court. Now, you barged in and shaded a rather promising evening. So I'll tell you now. Jean de Carrouges will not be the new captain of Bellême. You will be the new captain of Bellême. As if by magic. Carrouges will be furious. Too true. Now take off your pants! Short delay! Who wants to help me to get back to the previous state? Come here! Come on, boy! Le Gris! I will protect this fortress of Bellême and I will command its garrison as captain, to the best of my ability, against all the enemies of my king. Jacques Le Gris. Captain, stand up and be recognized! Good day! Join us, squire! It's a holiday. I will not stay, my lord. My God, tell me you're not here. to sue me again. Mock me if you want, but you can't change what's right and what's wrong. Enlighten me, squire, what is right? The way I see it, the last time you came to sue me for a land that I legally owned and gave it to one of the most faithful squire of mine, for his services to me. What claim could you have had on this land? You never owned it. I know all about your squire. The squire you gave it to. The one who owns a captaincy now, which is rightfully mine. My friend, please. - Let's talk in private. - No! No! (grunts) No! (grunts) I'll be heard! I won't accept this! My father, for 20 years, my father... I waited 20 years! No nobles here would speak ill of your father. You asked for my annuities, I paid them! Here, as a man of honor, you're saying I'm not the captain? Are you telling me I'm not the captain here? I'll tell you whatever I want. I decide who captains Bellême. That's what you value. Him. That sycophant. All of you, you sycophants! I'll sue you! I'll sue you for this! In just three years, you managed to take the daughter of a traitor, to sue me for the land that never belonged to you and stand before me for the second time, threatening me once again to sue me, while you talk about duty and honor. Is this how you serve me? I serve the king. The king. On the king. Heaven and earth! Heaven and earth what? 14. 37. 45. 15. 17 borrowed... Come in! Hello! I thought you were asleep, my lord. Yes, great... ... good friend. No, almost... But I saw candlelight and I knew it had to be you. I work better alone. You don't make it easy for the man. I came to tell you I'm not coming to Crespin's celebration. Milord? Too far, too cold. We'll stay here and go to sleep with women of our own. - No. - No. No, I was told that Jean de Carrouges would be there. Time to heal this wound. It will never change. Why keep trying? Because a feud between Your Highness' vassals only brings trouble and distraction. Oh my God! And because I was once the godfather of his late son! I once had a place in his heart. Do the right thing! You will see his mystery wife. Looks like he's letting her out of the dungeon one time. We can only hope he didn't take her books. Carrouges' wife reads? In as many languages as you, I hear. Strange pair. It is. will never cease? - Come to the celebration, my lord! - No. - Come on! - No. Too much wine. I'm missing the Latina. "I forgive a child who fears the dark." "Tragedy is men who fear the light." Your decency will be your end. And my decency has no end. No, my lord! Recalculate! Sorry. I think you'd like it. We'll ride out of the valley to where the river ends. We could have lunch there. My servants could prepare a picnic. Oh, Jacques Le Gris, don't waste your breath. I've heard all about you from the ladies of the court. Just bragging. Carrouges. Excuse me, milady. Carrouges. Le Gris. Peace! Bravo! Well done! Let there be no ill will among the king's servants. His Majesty needs us all now. That's right. Well said! Marguerite, come! Give my friend a kiss. Show him the good faith of the house of Carrouges. Well done! If I... That's it! I think. That's it! It's a pity we didn't meet until tonight. Yes? I didn't know how lucky Carrouges was. with such a beautiful wife. From what I hear, you're not in trouble. getting beautiful women. And from what I hear, we may have a lot in common. What could we have in common? Appreciation for our beauty. You are very talented at flattery. Just telling the truth. And what else? Are you a reader? Like me. The idyll of the rose. - I found it a bit boring. - Boring? The book is miserable. I prefer Percival's Courtesy. It's a much more provocative novel and more interesting. Clever woman! Tell me! He is naive and stupid. But he has such a pure heart, that he can claim the Grail. I admire that. I understand it. He knows what he wants... ... and doesn't give up until he gets it. Good minds belong together. Don't be hasty! Carrouges. Your wife charms me, my friend. And with thought you may covet, my lord. It's no less sinful than that she covets me. Please forgive me. I wish... Milord? I've never seen you like this, milord. Neither have I, my friend. It's not good news on the Scottish front. Perhaps Lady Marguerite is already a widow. I wouldn't bet against Jean de Carrouges in battle. What do you think she and Jean are talking about? Do you think they read together? But he's illiterate, isn't he? Duty to friends is the greatest of all. Greater than love? I didn't train him properly. The fault is mine. My God! Milorzi! I present to you the knight Sir Jean de Carrouges! My lord, I return from the royal campaign in Scotland to report to you. Arise, noble knight! Speak! We woke up uninvited by our Scottish allies. We have besieged the Wark. Louder, noble knight! I can't hear you back there. We've laid siege to the Wark. Milord, I'll be back... ...no spoils and no prisoners. And without five of the nine squires under my command. Indeed, I'll be back, knight. One who curses Scotland and the hour I set foot there. Yes. The news has arrived before you about your catastrophic campaign. A tragic result, Jean, although, dare I say not because of your leadership. That's right! Where are you going now, Jean? I'm going to Paris. I have business with the treasurer for my payment. Very well. Luck is not far from a good soldier. I'm back knight. That's the second time you haven't called me "sir". There won't be a third. It was unintentional, Sir Jean. I will not be taken from above... ...by this squire... ... who sits idle in the courtyard, waiting to be given gifts, after gifts, after gifts... ... and risk nothing! Nothing. Maybe it will acquire more properties in this world... ... will be more favored, will eat more, drink more... ... will have more women and otherwise calls himself a soldier. But in this room and in any other, in my company, will call me "sir". Sir. Sir. Indeed... ... good sir. Have fun in Paris... ... Sir Jean! That's all, Jean. Milord. Who is it? It's me, Adam Louvel, milady. Adam Louvel? I'm ashamed that I have to to ask you a big favor. My horse dropped a shoe and... There's nobody here. I'm not allowed to open the door. No, of course not. I was wondering if I could enter and warm up until it's changed. I'm sorry I have to ask. For a moment. I don't like asking you. Milady, forgive me for intruding. I love you more than any other and I would do anything for you. Everything I have is yours. How can you talk to me like that? Marguerite, how can I talk to you? Milady, you must know I have no choice. My love for you has consumed me. How dare you? Milady, when my master is in search of love... - Don't speak! - You must leave now. Please. - You heard the lady. Leave us! - My Lord. - I am married. - Yes. You're carrying a terrible burden. A cold, hard man who doesn't love you as I love you. Who doesn't appreciate how wonderful you are! - Please! - I just want your happiness. I can't bear to see you in need. I know your household finances are fragile. - My master supports me. - Yes. But he knows you're the most... ...refined... ... and fascinating woman? A woman... ... to whom I would dedicate my whole life. Oh, listen to me, I'm in love with you. I know you love me too. I must. You have to leave. Now, please. Jeanette! If you run, I'll just follow you. - No. - Yes, you will. No. No. No. No! No. No. Please don't! You fear guilt, but, my love, I beg you, don't tell anyone. For your own safety. If your husband hears about this... ... it might kill you. Don't say anything! And I'll keep silent. Don't feel bad, my love! We couldn't help ourselves. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Speak, my son! I bear a sin that weighs heavily on my heart. What is it, my son? I have committed the sin of adultery... ...against a man whom I once considered a friend. - Do you know your commandments? - Yes, Father. I beg your forgiveness. Son, Matthew tells us that he who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. But is love a sin, Father? - How can I seek forgiveness for love? - This is the devil's work. This temptress leads you astray. As Eve lured Adam from the divine path. This is not love. Then why? God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted more than you can bear. This is a test. - Friend. - My Lord. Sit down! You'll have to sit down. Drink this! You should drink it all. There's no other way to put this than in the vernacular. An unspeakable accusation has been brought against you. Jean de Carrouges, obviously, among others, told anyone and everyone willing to listen that you... ... you dishonored his wife against her will. I don't know what to say. Why would they say that? Jacques, it's you and me here. I need to know. It's a serious matter. The accusation is false. Naturally, he protested properly, but she's a lady. It wasn't against her will. Why would I need to do that? You know I miss the company of women? No. But you haven't been yourself lately. It's true, I confess, it's a feeling I've never felt before. A love... ...that I never knew. It took all my strength not to go back to her. I knew it was wrong. I confessed my adultery and did my penance. But I swear to you, the rape charge is false. Of course it's absurd. As I suspected. But I must protect my name. No, you don't have to do that. On my honor, I will, my lord. You must. I know you long to defend your name and honor, but the common mind does not have the capacity for that kind of nuance. They don't understand the world the way we do. They see villains and heroes, that's all. My Lord... Deny, deny, deny! Everywhere, always, at all times and to everyone. You did not commit adultery. It didn't happen. There's no evidence of it. It will be your word against of Jean de Carrouges. Yes, my lord. Of course, you'll have endure a public trial, charges of rape will be brought against you and a verdict will be reached by your senior, adjudicating this matter which, incidentally, it's me. I find Sir Jacques Le Gris entirely innocent and entirely blameless. I hereby order the annulment of the criminal complaint and expunge it from the record. Let there be no more questions about it. Let there be no more gossip, the punishment being given by me. Is that understood? As regards sworn testimony of Lady Marguerite, one may conclude only that she must have been dreaming. Now, these findings be sent to Paris immediately, before this careless knight to trouble the king with this nonsense. Yes, speak! My Lord, I have been informed that Jean de Carrouges has already gone to Paris. He's appealing to His Majesty at this very moment. You bastard! Clergy benefit. There is no decision to be made. You're a clergyman on minor business. So you can avoid the jurisdiction of the secular courts and be judged by the Church, where conditions are more favorable. Men in the service of the Church are far fewer among those accused of rape. They escape serious punishment by claiming the benefit of the clergy, so we'll have the Church try the case to put an end to this. But what about my name? There was... ... a romance? No way. It's strange that he would claim it was rape, risking his life. Why would he do that? All of France is talking about it and I'm innocent. I said publicly that this didn't happen! And yet, under extraordinary pressure and risking his name and reputation, Lady Marguerite said it happened. Formally, it's not about her. Rape is not a crime against a woman. It's a property crime against her male guardian. In this case, Jean de Carrouges. It's not a matter for to duel to the death. It should be resolved discreetly. Accept the benefit of the clergy. I am not a coward. Most high and mighty king and our sovereign lord, introducing myself. Jacques Le Gris... reliever and defendant, and hereby deny all of the above allegations, especially... ... of Jean de Carrouges that illegally... ... and carnal, I would have known his wife, Lady Marguerite de Carrouges... in the third week of last January... ... or any other time. And I still maintain, saving Your Majesty's honor, that that knight, falsely and maliciously lied! And that he is false and wrong to say so. And I still maintain... ... and with God's help... ... and with our Lady... ... I vow to do whatever is necessary to prove my innocence. The knight and squire have spoken well. It is now ordered that the parties submit their statements upon which, after receipt, the court will render a verdict in two weeks. If any of the men attempt to flee Paris, will be taken as a sign of his guilt. Orders will be issued for his arrest... ... and will be hanged. The King will decide whether a duel should really be held. What next? You will have 330 pounds in coins, furniture, fabrics and jewellery, in addition to the property at Mont a Gudot, as well as... What about Aunou-le-Faucon? I was forced to sell that property to Count Pierre. I have agreed that this land shall revert to him to whoever takes your daughter as his wife. Not part of the dowry? - I couldn't pay my rent. - You promised. We discussed this. My daughter comes with the money and the land that I have offered. It's all I own. What about the bride price? I'll give you a valuable name. I expect to be able to perform her wifely duties? To make an heir. My daughter is strong and healthy... ... and ready to honor the marriage. Conceiving an heir and the children that follow will be swift. And prolific. Carry on! The wedding will continue! You are perfect. I hope it was pleasant for you. Yes, my lord, very. I couldn't ask for a wedding night more satisfying. I may have conceived this very night. I think you'd like it. We'll ride... - ...from the valley to where... - My Lord. Carrouges. Carrouges. Le Gris. Peace! Bravo! Well done! Let there be no ill will among the king's servants. Marguerite, come! Give my friend a kiss. Show him the good faith of the house of Carrouges. Who's that squire? He's dangerously handsome. He has a famous reputation. If milord didn't come back from battle, I would gladly strengthen that reputation. I think it could be arranged that way. - Marie. - How can you talk like that? Shouldn't we be neither seen nor heard with you. My husband would have my head. But you'd die happy. He's handsome. Charming, I hear. True, he's handsome and charming, but my husband doesn't trust him. I'm proud of you. I know that this reconciliation must have been difficult. You gave me some good advice. You're good with Jacques Le Gris. That man's not full of it. But you see... ... how a smile and a kind word do more than a threat. Even if you're not sincere. While I'm away, except a rich harvest, the most we'll get out of it from horse breeding. And from collecting rents? Yes, of course. Stay there! I bought this mare for the stallion. He comes from a long line of war horses. Will make many valuable foals. Sometimes the difference between victory and defeat, between life and death... Out of the way! Out of the way! Watch the gate! No! Easy! No! Easy, girl! - Easy! - Get her! Not the stallion! No! Not you! Not with my mare! The gates are closed! Yes, my lord. The mare's in heat! These are not minor matters. It costs money. Nothing would get done around here, if it wasn't for me. I hope your little death was memorable and productive. It was like no other. Why haven't I conceived yet? I want a baby so much! Wanting a baby has nothing to do with that, Marguerite. We need a son. You think I don't know that? I can't think of anything else. I didn't have this problem with my first wife. I'll be back in a few months. You'll be safe here, with my mother and your servants. You don't have to stay never be left unattended. And don't be so sad! I prefer to be in a good mood when I go to war. I'm proud of you, milord. You will take care of the estate. See it doesn't fall into disrepair. Of course. - Good morning! - Milady. - Milady. - Good morning! Good morning, Henri! Good morning to you too, milady! The pregnancy seems to be going well. Yes, milady. Then why is it in the stable? Before the master leaves, that's what he told me to do. My husband knows a lot about horses. To ride them. I leave their upbringing to you. It would be better for the health of the mare to run free. Then she will run free. Thank you, milady. That's last month's rent too, milady. You couldn't pay? Your master didn't come for it. - Is that unusual? - No. But it's no bother. Thank you. Henri! Yes, milady. Aren't the oxen too slow? The thaw came late this year. It's been hard for them. If we want to sow the oats on time for the harvest, we have to hurry. I'd like to use the horses. But we never use them for that purpose. The master thinks they're too valuable. They will be worthless if they starve this winter. See that this is done. Just like that. I see the sun has caught you a little, milady. - You look well. - Do I? I prefer not to be pink. Although it's been a lovely day. A little colour on someone's face proves they're alive. Not really. Did you hear that the famous Parisian tailor is coming to the village next week? You've worked hard. Why don't you get a new dress? Oh, I don't know. Copy the dresses worn by Queen Isabeau. They're making waves. I saw them. The neckline is very big. So big, you can see the queen's pierced nipples. She doesn't have one. - It does. - No, it doesn't. Good evening! Good evening! Things seem to be going pretty well. I like doing these tasks. I enjoy it. Until he returns from Scotland, naturally. It's unfortunate, though, that you couldn't keep your husband away from conflicts with others. Jean does what she feels is necessary. May I ask what you're doing? It looks great. I say sadly that there's something... ... apparently fruitless. You're very cruel. I'm a good wife. As long as you fulfill your wifely duties. Or maybe you can't be satisfied. How's your sleep? Often interrupted. Flaccid joints. Bitter taste in mouth? I don't know. My lady, you seem to be suffering from an imbalance of the four humors, primarily the black ball. You're extremely melancholic, your body is cold and dry. Maybe this, along with other factors, including God's will, could prevent conception. It is imperative to have a pleasant ending, similar to your husband's, in order to conceive a child. Do you have one of these? Yes. Do you find relationships with your husband enjoyable? Yes, of course, Doctor. Although I'm not sure if I live "little death", as they say. But if you find it enjoyable, then you do it. Very good. When Jean comes back, he'll be grateful that I've got my accounts in order, as well as the others. Maybe he won't mind the expense. Let's get both dresses. Surprise your new husband! Wouldn't agree. She'd say I have enough dresses. I've only been married for a short time, but now I understand the burden of this arrangement. You're a newlywed. Surely you don't feel burdened. Bernard is a frugal man and he doesn't like to kiss me. I thought his appearance would become more pleasing. Instead, it became more repulsive. So I'm relieved, I guess, with the kissing. He's not like Jean, handsome and generous. My marriage is not without its problems. Be right with you, ladies. Thank you. Despite the many deplorable qualities of Le Gris, you can't be blind to his appearance. - As rude as it is. - And insulting. They're all so stupid! That's right. Welcome back, sire! Welcome home, my love! I'm so happy to see you! My God, Marguerite! Have you lost your dignity? Go up to the others won't think you're a wretch. I'm your wife. Welcome home, my brave son! Thank you. If only I'd seen the dress or known it was being made, I would have stopped it. And how would you have done that in my house? I wonder. Will you leave your wife speak to me in that tone of voice? Marguerite is a grown woman, Mother. The decisions she makes are her own. As well as the lessons learned. I have to leave for Paris tomorrow. I'll be gone for a week. But you're sick. You have to stay here in the house. - Yes, stay, please! - I'm owed money. - I intend to take it. - Of course you do. Perhaps you could visit some old friends. Le Gris is in Argentan. Why Le Gris? Please make sure Alice is with her while I'm gone. I forbid you to leave the estate. It's dangerous. I'd like to see my girlfriends. We're so isolated! Exactly. - You're leaving? - Yes. When will you be back? When I finish my chores. Before nightfall. Jean insisted I not be left alone. You heard him. Antoine! Scroafa! 8, 9, 10, 11, 12... Sit down! Who is it? It's me. Adam Louvel, milady. Adam Louvel? Hello! I have a big request. My horse dropped a shoe. There's nobody here. I'm not allowed to open the door. Of course. I understand. If I could just... ... wait inside while he's shoeing? Just to warm up a bit. It won't take long. It's just an inconvenience. - I'm sorry I have to ask. - Please. Oh, I'm not alone. Milady, forgive me for intruding. I love you. More than any other. And I would do anything for you. Everything I have is yours. How can you talk to me like that? Marguerite, how can I talk to you? Milady must know I have no choice. My love for you has consumed me. How dare you? Milady, when my master is in search of love... You must leave now. Please. - You heard the lady. Leave us! - My Lord. - I am married. - Yes. And you're carrying a terrible burden. A cold, hard man who doesn't love you as I love you. Who doesn't appreciate how wonderful you are! Please don't talk about my husband! I just want your happiness. I can't bear to see you in need. I know your household finances are fragile. - My master supports me. - Yes. But he knows you're the finest and fascinating woman? A woman to whom I would dedicate my whole life. Listen to me, I'm in love with you. And I know that you love me too. I have to. You have to go. Please! Please! Please! Marguerite, don't fight it! Jeanette! Jeanette! If you run, I'll just follow you. Jeanette! No! No! Come here! No. No! No! No! No! No! No! Please! Please don't do this! Please! This is our moment. Please! You feel guilty. Oh, but, my love, I beg you, don't tell anyone. For your own safety. If your husband hears about this, he might kill you. Don't say anything! Don't feel bad, my love! We couldn't help ourselves. Milady, we're back. Try a new cook and the food was very tasty, except for the cheese. I never liked this cheese, but unfortunately, it's everywhere. Thank you. There is one, and I forgot her name... It has different colors through it. Do you know the name of this cheese? I think it's Roquefort. No. No, no, not Roquefort. It's not as strong. But it has a certain texture that's very good in the kitchen. Milady. You haven't eaten. Are you ill? Lady Carrouges asked about your state of mind. My mood is good. Thank you, Alice. Don't open the door! It's Marie. I'm here to see Marguerite. Is she here? Okay. I am. - Come in! - Good day! Marguerite! I've never felt such joy! I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. Are you okay? You don't seem yourself. Aren't you happy for me? I'm very happy for you. Sire. I missed you. Didn't you miss me? Oh, you don't know how much! - Then let's go to bed. - Jean... - Marguerite, I've been away for days. - I can't. What do you mean, you can't? I need to tell you something. What? What? While you were gone, it was a day when your mother had chores in Saint Pierre. Yes. And shortly after that, a man arrived, unannounced. I knew him, so I let him in. But he wasn't alone. Jacques Le Gris entered our house without my permission and... - What about Le Gris? - He forced me into this room. In this bed. He raped me. Are you telling me the truth? Please. Are you telling me the truth?! Jean, please! It's the truth. You have to believe me. I screamed. I screamed until I lost my voice. Did he force you? He raped me. - You didn't provoke this? - No, Jean. You couldn't run away? It pinned me, I couldn't breathe. Can this man do nothing but evil to me? Jean, I intend to tell the truth. I will not remain silent. I have no legal position without your support. Then you'll have it. Come on! I won't allow it to be the last man to know you. - Jean... - Come! Come! Milady... ... swear on your life that what you say is true? I swear. Do you swear before God? And all of France? Yes. Then we'll fight. Marguerite is my wife and we have been wronged. I will not allow it to go unpunished. Your only way is through Pierre. Though I doubt he'll grant you an audience. Tell the story you heard today. Wherever you can and to all who listen. We will be the subject of gossip. If the story is known throughout Normandy, Pierre will have to give us an audience. We have a plan. Marie! Wait a minute! Why can't you look at me? I can't. Marie. Don't you remember? You said on more than one occasion that you found Le Gris handsome. And so do you. But I'm not complaining about rape. Marie! You don't believe me. I have to go. No, Jean, no! That's not what I want! Isn't that what you want? Can't be judged for his actions in court? Pierre is the court! If you appeal to the king, he'll only take Pierre's side, as he has done in the past. I will not appeal to the king. I will appeal to God. Marguerite, why did you do that? Because what happened to me is wrong. Men like Le Gris take women when they want to. and as often as they want. Who do you think you are? My son could die. That's his choice. Not mine. You're no different than the nancy girls our soldiers use in war. Are they complaining? I can't shut up. I have to talk. Marguerite! All you did was bring shame our family. I speak the truth. The truth doesn't matter. You're looking at me like I was never young. I was raped too. And despite my protests and my revulsion, I went to complain to my master, who had other concerns altogether? No, I got up and got on with my life. But at what cost? At what price? I'm alive. You paid a dear price for the privilege. I have heard from several sources that you've told others that you found monsieur Le Gris handsome. Perhaps you dreamt this event, wishing it were true. Yes, a long time ago, me and some friends agreed that he was handsome, but I told them I knew he wasn't reliable. Noticing that a man is attractive reveals exactly that. And if one of these women is your girlfriend, why would she bring this information into court? I don't know. You've been with Jean de Carrouges for how many years? Five. At this time, you haven't had any children, an heir to the family name. No, monsieur. No. And yet, here you are, six months after the incident you claim to be true, and you're six months pregnant. Maybe you have another boyfriend and you accuse Le Gris to hide it. Like I said, I'm loyal to my husband. Do you like having sex with your husband? Yes, of course. It's not self-evident. You are aware that you can't conceive a child... - ...unless you feel pleasure at the end. - Yes. Yes. And do you feel pleasure at the end? Yes. I do. Rape can't cause pregnancy. It's just science. Let the court ask itself whether, after five years of marital relations, your pregnancy is... ... a coincidence. Let's say we believe you're telling the truth and that such an act actually took place. Maybe you liked it more than you're willing to admit. Please explain to me how someone can enjoy rape. Did you feel pleasure? - Answer the question! - I felt no pleasure! Any more questions? If your husband were to lose the duel, it would prove God's judgment and reveal that you have testified falsely. I see. I'm sure your husband told you that the penalty for perjury brought by a woman against a man in case of rape is to be undressed and cut, fastened by the neck with an iron ring, tied to a wooden pole and burned alive. Lady Marguerite... ... is quite common... ... for a defendant to burn for 20 or 30 minutes, before she dies. I'm telling the truth. We will continue with the duel. Do you think Le Gris is handsome? You've put me to shame in front of my king and all of France. You knew what would happen to me if you lost the duel. You knew and you didn't tell me. God will not punish those who tell the truth. The fate of me and our child will not be written by God's will, but by which old man will tire first. How dare you speak to me like that? What have I got to lose? I begged you to find another way, and now I may be burned alive. I risk my life for you! You risk my life, to fight your enemy and save your pride. And that could leave our child an orphan. Or haven't you thought of that? You're a hypocrite. You are blinded by your vanity. 28 December 1386 All preparations are done. I am ready. I'd like to stay a little longer. Faith, Marguerite! I just gave birth to a son I love more than I could have imagined. And I may not live to see him grow up. That was my life. If I had known that the truth would deprive me of this love... ... I think I would have done what many women have done before me. Nothing. You did well what you did. Not if I die. I'm not like you, Jean. A child needs his mother more than a mother needs to be right. Gentlemen, begin! Lady... ... following your evidence, I risk my life in battle with Jacques Le Gris. You know my cause is just and true. I say it in front of all of you: I told the truth. May it be in God's hands! Justice will be harsh today by the grace of God. Let us pray that it will end like the duel of Flanders. With Le Gris in a wrestling match, ripping Carrouges' testicles off. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hurry! Give it to me! Lance, lance! Hurry up! Out of the way! Lance! Lance! Axe, axe! Carrouges might bleeding to death. Oh, God! Kill him! Kill him! - Kill him! - Kill him! Kill him! Confess! Confess! Carrouges, there was no rape. There was no rape. There was no rape! In the name of God and with the danger of the damnation of my soul... ... I am innocent of the crime! Then damn you! Yes! God be with you, milady! No... Get up! Get up. I honor you, knight. God has spoken, proving your cause sincere and just. You fought with strength and humility. God be with you and your wife! Your wife. Long live Carrouges! Carrouges! Glory to Carrouges! Carrouges! Look! Subtitle: ghartausz
