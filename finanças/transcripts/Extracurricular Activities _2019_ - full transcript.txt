Subtitles by explosiveskull Your mother and I have dinner reservations, so you kids are on your own tonight. Fine. I'll just order pizza or something. So, what's this restaurant you're taking us to out in the middle of nowhere? New Belgian Fusion. - Oh. - No, no pizza, honey. That is just full of fat and carbs. You know what? There is a quinoa broccoli casserole in the fridge. Of course there is. "This hidden gem boasts magnificent views that are worth the drive..." And the food? I'm getting there. Hey, Becky, listen to your mother. That's a healthier choice. - We'll be home later tonight. - Whatever. You know that fat-ass just called Dominos right now. You're absolutely right. "Serving a menu of farm-to-table Belgian fare that artfully surprises and tickles the senses." Jesus! She's morbidly obese and stupid. We're gonna be stuck with her forever. And don't even get me started on Mr. Fancypants. Do you know I caught him using my fucking eyeliner again? - Ugh. - Ugh. "It's a culinary experience for the ages." - Hmm. - Hmm. Can we not talk about the kids right now? We have the whole evening to ourselves. You're right. A night free from ungrateful, underachieving teenagers. Ah. We'll just pretend they're dead. Oh, it would be amazing. How many stars? Five stars, across the board. Will Fitzgibbon, one of the two hikers who came across the wrecked SUV... - Oh, my God. - Oh, no. ...is clearly still shaken by the experience. That is a body bag. "There were body parts everywhere," he said. My cousin Jared is still throwing up." More to come as a search for the identity of the victims continues. This is your on-the-scene reporter, Sally McDuffy, KFT, Channel Five News. You don't need me for this. It's a car accident. Chief asked for you specifically, and she also said that when you complain, to tell you that you're not too good to do regular police work. Shit. Now what do we got? Oh, shit. I know, what an asshole, right? No, I know the plate. Call it in. It's Dan Wallace. His kids go to school with my son. It's probably his wife, too. I'm sorry, Cliff. It's "Detective". You know, listen, get the department shrink to meet me at the station in an hour and get an official from Washington High on the phone. I gotta get grandparent or guardian information on those kids. Now, Sam. Shit. Funeral arrangements are being set for Tuesday. Don't be afraid to talk to your friends about their loss. Sometimes all they're looking for is someone to listen. Yes, Reagan. I just wanted to remind everyone that donations for the "Ben and Becky Wallace Fund" are now being accepted. You can donate in the school office or we've also set up a website. What the hell do they need money for? Didn't their parents drive like an $80,000 SUV? Yeah, they're like super-wealth... Hey! Would you guys shut up? Reagan's talking. I'm just saying they're already rich. What's going on there? Reagan deserves our undivided attention. Thank you, Miss P. I just want everyone to think about Ben and Becky. Every donation counts, no matter how small. Thank you all for coming today. I know they would have appreciated it. What can I say about our parents? They were the warmest, most caring, supportive people. They loved to travel. Whale watching in Aruba, gallery hopping in Paris, wine tasting in Sonoma. Of course, usually they would go by themselves, but, um, they'd always come back. Just not this time. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins. I didn't know your parents well, but I liked them. I wanted to say thank you for the Edible Arrangements. It's no problem. It's my pleasure. Thank you so much for coming. We really just... Oh, um... Okay. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. All right. - It's all right. - Okay. All right. All right. Okay. - Okay. - Thanks. Be well. Be well. - Pull it together. - Okay. Ow. Shit. Oh, my God. Get the... Eat your fucking food. Right now. - You're pulling too hard! - Get up, you little shit, get the fuck up. Eat your fucking burger. Come on! So Briggs has this new paralegal. Dude, I stood behind her in the elevator, you have got to see the turd-cutter on this chick. Oh, my God it's ama... It's okay, we're talking about Mommy. It's okay. So, anyway, yeah, dude, it's... - I... dammit, Kailee! - Oh, my gosh. What the hell? Again... Greg, I gotta call you back. They have telethons for kids that don't spill as much as you. Oh that's it, cry. Yeah, cry just like Mommy. Yeah. Great meal, honey. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Honey, how are those Wallace kids doing? You know, the ones that lost their parents? Oh, um, uh, they're hanging in there. Ben actually just turned 18 a couple days ago, so I think he's gonna petition to become Becky's legal guardian. Wow. - That's a big responsibility. - Mm-hmm. I mean, won't that affect his college options? I guess they're just seeing how everything goes day by day. - Hmm. - Hmm. Um, if it's okay with you guys, I was thinking about maybe going out tonight? Tom Mulnick is having a party. A party? Will there be girls? Yes, Mom, there will be girls. Tom Mulnick? I've never heard you mention him before. No, he's just a... friend from school. I tutor him sometimes. Oh, oh, will there, uh, be alcohol? Probably. But you know my philosophy with that. When have I ever let you down? - Never. - Nope. Go! Have fun. Yeah. Have a good time. All right. Hm, cool. See you guys later. - All right. - Okay. A party with drinking and girls. It's nice to see him acting his age. Damn, there you go. Mm. Oh, shit. Okay, here, gimme that. Hurry up. Hurry up. You gotta breathe sometime, hombre. Sweet shit. May I have a toke? Who are you, man? Oh, I'm cool. This is my party. Okay. Yeah, man. Get after it. You all right, there? Bitchin' weed. Yeah, yeah it is. Catch you later, dudes. Mm, yes. ♪ Oh, we got it goin' on Oh, shit, look at this skinny one right... Oh, yeah. Oh! Oh, my God. I guess you figured out which one is my dad. Unless you were planning on inviting the world's oldest high school student. Hyah! He wishes. Hey, Tom, nice party. Hey, Mary Alice. Yeah, it's okay. We ran out of ice. We can't par-tay without any ice. There's some in the garage, Dad. Tommy, step to it. We gotta keep this party going. Hey girl, um, you wanna dance? No, thanks. I like your personality. What a jerk-off. He had some pretty sweet moves, though. Surprised to see you here. Yeah? Why's that? Well, you just don't strike me as the high school kegger type. Oh, come on, I'm just expanding my horizons. Expand them more and dance with me. Thanks, but I'm not much of a dancer. Well, lucky for you I am. Sure. But you're still my first choice. I know it's not really your thing. I actually saw some cool stuff. Whoa! Dad, where are you going? Hot tub. Eh, don't-do not... Actually, yeah, that's a great idea. Dude, what the fuck? Just let him be. Hey! I said hey. Back off, fuck-puppet. ♪ Do do do Whoa, whoa, bro. Hey, we're all full in here. My tub, my rules. Now, let him in. Ugh. Fuckin' bitch. Just hanging out with my dudes. I'm hungry for a hotdog. Guess who I am? Guess who I am! Edward Forty Hands! Mmm. Ugh. Hey. Who wants to fuck? Get outta here! Hyah! So sensitive. - See ya, man. - Thanks, dude. Eh. Next one's gonna be even crazier. Can somebody get me a beverage? Thanks, man. You got class. I think that's everybody. Mind giving me a ride home? You didn't drive? I didn't tonight. All right. Here, let me tell my da... Eh, you know what, fuck it. Let's go. It looks like it was a pretty rad party. Man, back when I was in high school... You do realize that somebody died, right, Sam? Just... wait, where did you get those? Over there. Those could be evidence. Just, go do something useful. Go check the hot tub. I'm so sorry, Tom. Do you have any relatives that we can contact? My grandma. But could you let me call her please? It's... Oh, God. This is gonna kill her. Yeah, of course, whatever you need. Uh, hey, Cliff, I, uh, found this in the hot tub. Did you want me to bag it? Dad probably drank that when I left to take my friend home. Not supposed to. He's on medication. Oh, what type of medication? Hyd... hyd... hydrochlorothiazide. He has UTIs. UTIs, yeah, alcohol, diuretics in a hot tub. That's killed more people than you'd believe. So, y... you did want me to bag this? No. Sa... hot water and chlorine, Sam? It's not gonna be anything but clean. Oh. Just put it down. Please go do something else. Sorry. He's just... he's a fuckin' idiot. Next. Hey, so? It's okay. It's fine. Are they gonna tell our parents? Relax. They just want to know what happened to Tom's dad. My tub, my rules. Now, let him in! - Ew! - Oh. We tried our best to contain it, but most of the videos have gone viral. Just hanging out with my dudes. Oh. Oh! Oh-okay. I think we... I think we've seen enough, Sam. - Oh. - I'm hungry for a hot dog. Well, it didn't come from me. - I don't even own a cell phone. - Really? I've never heard of a high school kid that doesn't own a cell phone. Refreshing is what it is, but frankly, Reagan, I'm surprised you'd even be at a party like this. Mrs. Reed, you can go to a party without drinking or doing drugs. Isn't that what you've drilled us on for years now? I mean, give me a break. I'm... sorry. That was disrespectful. It's all right, Reagan, we understand. It's been very stressful for everyone. Detective... Uh, hi, Reagan, uh, my name is Detective Dawkins. Nice to meet you. This is Officer Pickett. Uh, I have seen you somewhere before, haven't I? Uh, yes, sir. At the Wallace funeral. Ben and Becky told me how much of a big help you were. Oh, well, they friends of yours? Well, actually, Reagan almost single-handedly put together the student support effort for them. Well, I appreciate that. All this must be hard on you, too. Three friends losing their parents so close together. I just want to help out any way I can. Sixty percent? As agreed. You want one? No. So, I'm taking most of my commission out in cash. The rest I'll collect from the insurance payouts. And the online account? You've been emptying it daily, right? Yeah. Just like you said. Great. What about the envelope that I told you not to open 'til we're done. Yeah. Hold on. When: house party. Where: hot tub. How: hydrochlorothiazide and a forty. Unbelievable. What do I do with this? Wow. You're good at this. Some people choose to work at Yogurt City, Tom. I choose not to. It's kind of a big difference, though. Oh, what got you into... I mean, like, how did you decide...? There are 2,000 students at our school, which translates to, uh, 4,000 parents, give or take a few. Statistically, there will always be a few unredeemable shitheads in there. So you're just, um... Trying to make the world a better place. Right! Way better. Wow, you could really be screwed. Of course, there's always junior college. I don't want junior college. I want UCSB and now I've got Heather's fake-ass D-cups standing in my way. I guess I'll just have to figure something out. Mm-hmm. Mmm, it's good. And cue the male camel-toe. Bite me, alkie. Time to get our cheer on. Shouldn't you be, like, in mourning or something? Mm, life's for the living. Plus, I like to think my parents are watching from above, because that's my better angle. And I'm sure they're still quite ashamed. Thanks for the sympathy. Now let's get our cheer on. Team won't win without us. Yeah, and they're not gonna win with us either. Okay, come on, Kenny! Take it to the hole! Kenny, use that lazy-ass to block out. Can't you try to be supportive? What, he's too sensitive for a little criticism? He's doing his best. Come on. Kenny, you had a man open in the paint. All that kid wants to do is shoot threes. He doesn't want to pass. He doesn't want to block out. He's watching this game tape tonight whether he wants to or not. Yeah, all right. All right. Girls look cute. Makes me wanna get out there and shake it. Yeah, at least somebody in this gym knows what the hell they're doing. Okay, Cliff! - I'm gonna show this to Kenny. - Yeah, I... Show him what talent and practice does. Yeah, well, this is the only thing you've actually focused on. Whoo-hoo! Yeah, girls. Basketball? Seriously? Just watch the game, Sydney. Follow the ball and cheer when I do. So, tell me about your parents. Hobbies, activities, clubs. Three-pointer! Yes! Activities. You mean like their all-encompassing, back-to-nature lifestyle? Well, maybe. Tell me about it. It's making my life unlivable. Dinner's ready! Who's up for vegan tacos? Oh, my God, you guys are so disgusting! Relax, Syd, the human body is a beautiful thing. Mm-hmm. No, no, it's not. What's wrong, honey, aren't you hungry? No. And I'm pretty sure I'll never be hungry again. That's it? You asked for an example. I'm sorry, Sydney, that your parents are hippies, but if that's your only complaint, I... Oh, trust me, that's just the tip of the iceberg. This is Gary Vaughn and... Betty Vaughn. You are listening to Nature Matters. Northern California's leading podcast about foraging and things that are important to foragers. Yes, Gary, and this week I thought it would be fun to give a few tips to those beginners out there who might be interested in sourcing their own food in the wild. That does sound like fun. Again, I don't see the big deal. Shut up. I'm getting there. So their last book sold, like, a billion copies, right? And what did those hypocrites spend it on? Private air travel, a huge new wing on the house, two undocumented housekeepers who make $6.00 an hour. Clothes, watches, spa treatments, $400 haircuts. And not for them, by the way, for their fucking $5,000 hypoallergenic dog. Plus, stocks in nine of the ten most environmentally destructive companies on the planet. Turns out our biggest threat isn't global warming or nuclear winter. It's my parents. Okay. I got it. You're familiar with my terms, right? Anything. I just want it over with. Okay. I'm on it. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the game. Yeah! Staring off into the distance again? Did I ever tell you how sexy you look doing that? Jeanette... Wait. What? You started smoking again. I had one little cigarette. Well, one little cigarette, or the whole pack, it's still the same stink. Yeah, okay, I get it. I smoked. Sorry for polluting your little delicate, little smoke-free mouth. So, do you want to tell me what you're thinking about? This boy in Kenny's class. So, while I'm trying to have sex with you, you're thinking about a boy in Kenny's class? No. His name is Reagan Collins, and he knew all the kids whose parents died. Yeah, it's a small town, Cliff. A lot of people did. I don't know. This kid's weird. He doesn't even have a cell phone. Lock him up, he doesn't have a cell phone. Well, he's 17 years old. Even that little handicap girl who graduated last year, she had a cell phone and she doesn't have any arms. Cliff. I don't know, the kid just pings my radar, that's all. Okay, Cliff, listen to me. You are a good cop, but you don't have to try so hard. You had your moment in the sun with the Adderall bust. Accolades, your picture in the paper. Not every case has to be a home run. Yeah, you're right. That was some bust, though, wasn't it? I cut bangs, you didn't even notice. Mm. Hey, pal. What's up? I'm just working on a paper. English? No, biology. Fungus. Oh. Well, I'm sure you'll find a way to make that interesting, too. Oh, I'm trying my best. You always do. Proud of you, son. I know. In this map it's telling us it's only four minutes to reach this hill. - No, just... can you trust it? - It's... Yes, that's the point. It's... but, we're at Dixie Canyon... Have fun foraging. Bye-bye. - Hey. - Dad, what- Hey. What's so funny? Get out of here, Tommy, you soft little bitch. You're being stupid right now! Get outta here! Who wants to fuck? - Right now, who wants to fuck? - Are you serious? Come on, the man's dead. Show some respect. Break it up. Come on now. Tragedy has once again struck the community of Washington Heights. Two well-know foraging experts, Gary and Betty Vaughn, were found dead inside their home today. - Hey! Turn that up. - Authorities believe it may have been a case of accidental poisoning. This... is a death cap mushroom. It looks edible, but it's not. Here comes their daughter now. Sydney! Sydney, are you surprised your parents made such a careless and deadly mistake? Oh, I don't know. Why don't you suck my dick? Here come the bodies now. I just wanna help out any way I can. Shit. A B-plus? You missed one. It happens. Whoops. Time for a nervous breakdown. Just to ease your mind, you still have an A in class. No. This should be an A. You made a mistake. I'm happy to discuss it after class. Once we add the solid to the liquid, we'll see combustion. And it's green. No chemical traces. Well, that is some advanced chemistry. Well beyond this class. All right, I'll change it to an A. A-plus. Thank you. So that's how you get such good grades. Just pointing out a mistake. Can I help you with something? Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could walk me home. - Oh, I... I would, but... - Fine. I'll walk you. You're different than people think. I am? Yeah, well you seem like Reagan Collins, Mr. Serious Guy all about science and studying and making the world a better place. But you think I'm not like that. Oh, you are. Definitely. But, I think there's another side to you that's fun. Maybe a little twisted, but fun. Twisted, but fun, huh? Are you denying it? No, not necessarily. Uh, this is... me. I'd invite you inside, but I... I do have a lot of homework to do. Yeah... yeah, I should get home. I can't wait to see what Food Network recipe Heather's butchered this time. Oh, Heather? She's my step-mom. She's this big-breasted, dumb-ass slut who bosses me around while spending my college money. Sounds like a pretty common dynamic. Your parents divorced, too? No, uh, happily married, actually. Twenty years. But, if you're wondering how to deal with Heather, there are ways. Oh, you mean besides murdering her. Yeah. Just agree with her. Always. And I mean everything. You're kidding. No. No, no, no. She'll love it. Your dad will love it. And you just do whatever you want. Everybody wins. Okay. I'll try it. Look at that, I'm happy already. Thanks for letting me walk you home. Hey, Reagan. Got a minute? Detective Dawkins. Can I help you with something? Yeah. Just wondering if I could ask you a couple questions. Yeah, sure. Do you wanna come in? Yeah. Great. It'll only take a moment. Um, my parents aren't home yet. Is everything all right? Did something happen to them? What? Oh, no. Of course, they're fine. - They're fine. - Okay. No, I was just hoping to ask you some questions about Sydney Vaughn. Oh, okay. I'll use the restroom real quick and... Can I get you anything? No, I'm fine. Thank you. So you were asking about Sydney. It's so sad about her... parents. Yeah, terrible accident. Terrible accident. I saw you two sitting together at the Mission High game the other night. Yeah. So? So, I just thought I'd ask you a few questions about your relationship. Uh, uh, our relationship? Well, I would have assumed that you two were dating until I saw you kissing that pretty redhead. I... I'm... I'm sorry, Detective, wh... what is this about again? Sydney is just a girl that I know from school, so... Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about her. She tell you about her relationship with her parents? She must be going through a lot right now. What is it that you two talk about? Actually, I can't talk about that. Son, you are aware this is a police investigation? Even so. Well, let me put it to you like this, either you can tell me here or you can tell me at the station. I'll grab a sweatshirt. Oh, Jesus. You should've brought me in on this, Cliff. I would've told you this is a terrible idea. Did you hear a single word that I said? You brought a minor in here and didn't tell his parents or charge him? Are you insane? He's killing people, Ronnie. Do you remember the Adderall bust? You never let anyone forget it. Everybody thought I was wrong. Was I wrong? You were not. Exactly. I was right. What is wrong with just doing your job, Cliff? This is a bedroom community. Traffic tickets, jaywalking, the occasional break and enter. We do not get psycho teenage serial killers here. So, it's true. Why is Reagan Collins in my interrogation room? Hey! I brought him in. He's connected to all those kids whose parents died. Connected how? He's responsible. Are you out of your mind, Cliff? Jane, people are dropping dead all over this town and this kid is the only common denominator. The reports you wrote said "accident". And now I'm telling you they weren't. There is a pattern. Reagan Collins was the last kid at the Mulnick party, he was running the Wallace fundraiser, and he was with Sydney Vaughn right before her parents died. When questioned, he was evasive, and I found an encyclopedia opened to the entry "M", and I am tell... Oh, God, would you just shut up? That kid was in my husband's scout troop. His mother is my dermatologist. It's a con. He is lying to you, and I wanna know what you're gonna do about it. Fuck. Yeah, I'm glad he didn't break his oath, too. Thanks, Miss Peterson. Again, sorry to bother you at home. Good night. You realize if Reagan's parents decide to file a complaint, your ass is toast, right? The Vaughn girl was assigned to him. Assigned? Yeah, he's a peer counselor, you jackass. Confidentiality is part of the program. He was keeping his promise, not killing her parents. - Jane... - What is wrong with you? Do you realize that we're here to solve crimes - and not invent them? - And I... And if you bring up that Adderall case one more time, you will be the next one dead, because I will shoot you in the face. I'm done with your wild goose chases. - This goose is real. - Get out, Cliff. And, Cliff, take the boy home. I hope it helps. Thanks for the donation. Sydney can really use it. That must have been pretty embarrassing back there. Hey, if you're wondering if I'm mad, I'm not. Honestly, you're just trying to do your job. Frankly, I think it's a bit unprofessional the way your co-workers make fun of you behind your back. Anyway, thanks for the ride. Okay, then. No hard feelings? All righty. Wuss. We ate without you. I was gonna reheat some pot roast, but I see you brought your own meal. That's a generous pour. Would you like some ice with that or... Oh, apparently not. Wow. Looks like about, uh, 25,000 calories there. You trying to put back on all the weight you lost? Kenny's outside with James. Trying to dunk. They're getting closer every day. He should be studying. If he fails out of class, they're gonna kick him off the team. Really? That's it? That's all you have to say? I don't wanna talk about it. Where are you going? Outside. Don't wanna miss this dunk. Yeah. Mr. Fun Drumstick. Aw, come on, man. Oh, hey. Good take, Kenny. No, don't stop. Don't stop. No, keep going. Actually, give me the ball. Let me play, too. - Dad, come on. - Seriously? - What? - Just give him the ball, man. Let's go. There we go. Show you boys how it's done. Wow. You know, I think you'd get a little better arc there if you got rid of the drumstick. Very funny. You guys wanna play HORSE? How 'bout some PIG? There he is. My son, the comedian, ladies and gentlemen. The comedian who can almost dunk. Ah. Well, that's a P. All right, got you right where I want you. Hey, you guys, uh, you know a kid at your school named Reagan Collins? Who? Oh, you know him. He was over at the Mulnick party. Pale, delicate, preppy-looking kid? Oh, yeah, that guy. Yeah, I think he's in my chemistry class. - Yeah? - All right, what are we doing? Are we gonna play basketball or what? Just making conversation. You ever talk to him? No. I mean, not really. He's one of those guys that only talks to adults. Kinda sounds like one, too. Dad, why are you asking us this stuff... It's a work thing, Kenny. Okay, well, no one we know hangs out with him. So, can you shoot the ball? It's your turn. No. Game's over. Dad. Ball. No. No more ball. James, go home. Kenny, get inside. Hit the books. Dude, don't take this the wrong way, but your dad's a dick. You look like hell. I just need a little coffee. Did you look in the mirror? It's gonna take a lot more than coffee. Hey. I need you to help me get Reagan Collins' Internet activity. There is no way I'm doing that. Come on. The kid's out there making us look like fucking idiots. He's not making me look like an idiot. Look, if that disrespectful little shit is out there killing people and you don't do anything about it, then that's on you. All right. I will see what I can do. Good, because I'm gonna need some help with surveillance, too. I don't even wanna hear about that. Reagan, wait. Come on. Come on, Reagan, I can't run that fast. I've got degenerative bursitis and I'm pretty out of shape. Do I know you? Hey, man. Grant Hall? Okay, so? So, can you slow down a minute? Coach is watching. Nice chatting with you, though. Wh... ah... I love ice cream! What flavor? Uh, uh, rum r... uh, butter pecan. Butter pecan! Okay, I'll talk to you later. Wait, that's it? I said I would talk to you later. What, are you spying on me now? As if. Okay, what's this about? We need to talk. - Okay. - Not here. All right, smile, asshole. You recorded him? I got a lead. No, shit. Okay. No, it's just... What, are you spying on me now? We need to talk. Not here. Okay, what's this about? I need you to do something for me. That sounds like a murder solicitation. Or she wants help with her algebra. Who is she? I don't know. Some cheerleader. I don't know her name yet. Jesus, she's hot. Come on, don't be a pervert. Mary Alice Walker. Can we please go now? Uh, kind of in the middle of something. I need to get out of here. In a little while. Have a beer. Relax. I've had three and it's not helping. Try four. Beer number four it is then. Get me a beer. Well, she took the last beer. Yo, Grant! Grant, where you at? Jesus! I was taking a piss. Hey, I got some more beer in my car. Go get it for me. Hurry up. "There's beer in my car. Go get it." What am I, a servant? Stupid. Told you I'd see ya. Okay, so let me make sure I got this straight. Your mom has custody of you and your sister and there's a boyfriend. Yeah, Hector. That goddamn ball-bag is all my mom cares about. Hector. Hector. Hector. So, you're saying his name is... Hector. Total prick. You know, I looked some stuff up online. He's married, for one. And he's been arrested three times, and the last time was for stealing from little old ladies at the retirement center where he worked. That's pretty low. No, it gets worse. He was seducing them and then stealing their money. Does your mom know about this? Are you kidding? I heard them talking. It was her idea. W... I... I mean, not like the love-making. That was Hector. He also wears like a crap-ton of man jewelry, which I understand, you know, is a personal choice, but, like, it doesn't stop... Wait, why don't you just go live with your dad? Oh, we can't. Mom told the court a bunch of lies to get custody. If it was just me, it'd be okay. You know, another year and I'm gone, but... I've got a little sister, man. You should see the way mom yells at her. - Mom, look what I found... - Not now! Oh, did I mention they like to do it in Hector's car? - Oh, yes, Hector. - Right outside on the street. The whole neighborhood knows. Oh, Hector, oh. Last week, I came home and found my sister watching them. Hector. Hector, oh! She's seven, man. What would you do? Well, that's not for me to decide, Grant. But the good news is, these problems you're having, they're solvable. - You think so? - I know so. But there are a couple questions you have to ask yourself first. One, do you and your sister deserve to be humiliated and neglected anymore? Hell, no. Two, would you be better off with your dad? Would your sister be better off? Yes. And yes. Okay, let's do it. Oh, one thing, though, I don't... exactly have a lot of... money. Not yet. Need some help? What are you doing here? Oh, you know, it's my hobby, just wandering through the park looking for drunk cheerleaders so I can steal their keys. Drunk? I've had, like, two beers. Okay, four. Keys. Wow, you really are quite the Boy Scout. I'm okay. Don't be modest. You could have just saved my life. What can I possibly do to thank you? It's okay, really. Really. Come on, there must be something. No. No? It's late. Come on, you've been drinking. So, you're saying if I hadn't had two... Four. Four beers, this could've taken a different turn? Wow, you really aren't like the other guys. Can you give me a ride? Why don't we walk? Walk? It's like, 20 miles. It's two. Come on. Thank you for walking her home. It was a pleasure, sir. It was so nice to meet you, Reagan. You too, Mrs. Walker. Take care. What a nice young man. Why doesn't he smell like a brewery? Reagan doesn't drink. Could learn a lesson from a kid like that. We talked about this. Yeah, and I know it was stupid, Daddy, but I heard your voice in my head telling me not to drive home, so I didn't. Smart girl. But it was irresponsible of you to leave the car there. It's an Audi. Shut the fuck up, Heather. This has nothing to do with y... Wait, no... Too late. Keys. In. You know, I was this close to following your advice about Heather, and now, for the next week, I'll be riding the bus. Well, at least you'll be reducing your carbon footprint. It's like every time she opens her mouth, I just want to strangle her. Uh, Reagan. Uh, Ben. We're gonna talk and you're gonna listen. Should I leave? No. They are. I'll leave when I'm good and ready. Jesus, Ben, chill. Stay the fuck out of this, Mary Alice. You're supposed to be in your cheer uniform today. Give me a break. We're not doing this here, Ben. Go away. Ben. Don't fight. Please? Don't fucking pull me. What's wrong with him? Nothing. He'll get over it. Probably on his period. I've been going through the files in each case. Look at that photo, tell me what you see. Mmm, nothing. Uh, road. Exactly. A road. No skid marks. They just decided to drive full speed off a cliff? Mm, probably not. No. You're goddamn right probably not. Did we ever have that vehicle checked for tampering? You know we didn't, Cliff. It's probably crushed in some junkyard. Shit. Hey. Anything come up on the kid's, uh, Internet activity? No. Since we broke about a dozen laws looking, I'd appreciate it if you shut the fuck up. Come on, nothing? That kid is off the grid. He must be a Luddite. But, a 17-year-old Luddite? That doesn't sound the least bit suspicious to you? I try not to judge people based on their preferences, Cliff. I have a brother-in-law who spends all day in the park, fanny pack full of bird seed. Does puppet shows for the homeless. Doesn't make him a criminal. I can feel this one in my gut, Ronnie. Or you're obsessing. Okay, maybe you're right. I know I'm right. Hey, look what I made! It's neat and it's... Shut up and get me a beer. Now! Stupid kids. I don't think we should pay him any more. Well, what the fuck do you think we're doing here? Of course we're not paying him any more. If he thinks he can fuck with us, I'll... Drive. So, have you figured out what you wanted to say yet? Yeah, we did. Next time, would you guys mind being a little bit more discreet? Fuck you! We're done. Done? I'm sorry, with what? Tell him, Ben. Yeah, tell me, Ben. We're not paying you any more. Excuse me? He's right. Okay, we've paid enough. I mean, do you have any idea how bad we feel about what we've done? I can barely sleep at night. The stress is ruining our lives. - The stress? - Yeah. Your parents were ruining your lives with their homophobia, their fat-shaming, and their complete unwillingness and inability to deal with your... qualities. We gave you that referral. All right? With what we already gave you, that should be enough. You're forgetting our terms, Ben. Yeah, well, there's new terms, Reagan. Leave us alone or... We'll go to Kenny's dad. Yeah. We'll go to Kenny's dad, and we'll tell him it was all your idea to murder all these parents, and we were too afraid to do anything. Okay, Dawkins? Really? That's your plan. Yeah. Ben and Becky Wallace murder solicitation, August 15th. All right, Reagan, we've decided. They suck, we want them dead. And my terms are acceptable? Yes! Yes, the sooner the better. Fuck me. Fuck. Whatever, just pay him, Ben. We're rich... Not if you keep ordering all those fucking vintage Playgirl magazines off eBay. Well, at least I'm not the one who blew two grand on laser hair removal. I'll expect my cut off the insurance money. If your reference pays off, I'll give you guys a nice refund. Okay? Okay. - Okay. - Okay. By the way, nothing says grieving orphans like an $80,000 Mercedes. Hey, Reagan? Hell of a nice car that boy's got. I guess. I'm not much of a car guy. Really? Oh, I am. Although, on a detective's salary I'll never have a ride like that, but man, there's something about that new car smell, isn't there? Yeah, I guess. They give you another payment? What? Come on, Reagan. Don't try to shit a shitter. How long have you known? I'm a lot smarter than you think I am, son. That's good. 'Cause honestly, the guilt was starting to get to me. Are you sure you can't just take it and let me go? I... I know it's illegal to download music that I didn't buy, but I wasn't planning on selling it. What are you talking about? Copyright laws. We broke them. You got me. Copyright laws? Yeah. Just don't bring Ben and Becky down for this. I mean, they've had it hard enough with their parents and everything. Copyright laws. That's... That's cute, Reagan. How old are you? 16? - 17. - 17. It's a good age. I mean, you look like an adult, but you're still a kid. Got your driver's license, a year left in high school. August 15th... Yeah, it's not bad, I'll say. I mean, the only thing you could really do to screw it up would be to do something really stupid. Like what? I don't know, kill somebody? Maybe several people? I mean, because if you did something like that, I think the law would start looking at you like you were an adult. Then you'd be pretty darned fucked, wouldn't you? I guess I'm lucky I'm just a music pirate. Yeah, lucky indeed. So, Detective, I... I know what I did was wrong, but is there any way I could get my player back? All right. But one slip-up from you, and I will be on you like bird shit on a shiny new car. Hey, pal. Why the long face? Oh, nothing, just a long day, I guess. Oh, this ought to cheer you up. Chief Brooks called my office this morning raving about what a wonderful, caring son we have. Really? Yeah, couldn't get her to stop. You know, all that peer counseling you're doing? Reagan, people notice. Colleges will notice. You might be right, Dad. Yeah. Oh, by the way, uh, a young lady just called for you. Your mom has been on the phone with her for the last 20 minutes. - Oh. - Yeah, better get in there. Mother? ...Modern dance troupe in college. - Mom. - Yeah... I had videos, - if you wanna see. - Mom? Mom. It's a girl. I know. Give me the phone. - Hey. - Hi. Your mom's pretty cool. Sometimes. What's up? Mm, well, I'm at the library at your suggestion. And? Not bad. Don't tell anyone, but I smuggled a latte in. You wanna join? Oh, well, actually I have to... Did I mention I'm completely sober? Actually, there is something you can do for me. - Thanks, Mrs. Flanders. - Mm-hmm. Hi. Thank you. Mary Alice, right? You're a cheerleader here. Yeah. I'm Detective Dawkins. I interviewed you about Tom Mulnick's father? Right. Trees. Big fan. Okay, well, just wanted to say hello. Hello. Hello. Okay. Periods of light rain growing steadier after midnight. Lows in the mid-50s and we're going to see some wet roads for the morning commute. Ah, The Weather Channel again. You'd tell me if you were gonna become a meteorologist, right? What? Yeah. So, you mind if I, uh, watch the news? All yours. Good. Hey. You figure out what you're gonna do for a summer job yet? I'm starting my own business. So, you're meeting me at Alta Park, big gazebo thing. 3:30, okay? I'll be there. - Are... yeah, you sure? - I won't be late. Hey, buddy. What's up? Hi, Grant. This isn't smart. Geez, I'm just saying hi. Now you did. Okay? I'll see you later. You know, you're a very rude person. Who the hell was that? That was just Grant. - I'll see you at the big gazebo? -30? Yeah, sure. Yah! And, just so you know, money isn't a problem. - Just let me know how much. - Okay. And hey, once my dad and Heather are out of the way, then we can really have fun. - We got it. - Sounds good. So, on Saturday I was thinking the bluff at Haver Point. I thought I was gonna be planning this? I didn't mean, I just... I just thought... Actually... Haver Point is perfect. Great. I got you, you twisted little shit. Don't you ever mess with Detective Clifford Art Dawkins. Yes. Fuck yes! Full house. Aces over fives. - Oh, come on, man. - Are you serious? Yes, I'm limping. No, it's not broken. What the hell, Cliff? I got him cold, brother. First degree murder. Aw, shit. Got whom cold? Oh, no. Cliff, no. Chief, I know what you're thinking, and here's what I have to say to that. In your face. Shit. Hold up. Shit. You should have had that cued up better. Okay. How can I say no to that? Good. And, just so you know, money isn't a problem, just let me know how much. Okay. And hey, once my dad and Heather are out of the way, then we can really have fun. Sounds good. There's more if you want to hear it. Hmm. Chief, I thought this was bullshit too, but now we have to investigate this. I think Cliff is right this time. I'm Adderall right. You're sure about this? I'd stake my badge on it. Well, that's good to know, 'cause I'm gonna hold you to it. Ah! Ah, goddamn that skinny motherfucker. How we lookin'? Nothin' yet. - Ow! - Oh! Goddamnit, Sam! Watch it! Dude, that-that thing is really gnarly. Why don't you just chill here in the van and we'll go take care of this. It's my operation, and I'm not gonna sit it out. And I'm not your dude, so just watch out for the foot. "Gnarly." - Hey, Sam. - Yeah. Shut up. That's it. That's it. That's it, that's the car. All right, let's roll. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Ah, goddamnit! Come on, come on, come on. Fan out. Fan out. Does anybody see anything? Ronnie, do not engage until my go. Fan out and stay quiet. Does anybody hear anything? Oh, fuck. Oh, motherfucker. Do not engage. I repeat, do not engage. No, no, no. You're too close to the edge. No, no, no, that's too close to the edge. Go! Go! Go! - Freeze! Freeze! - Ah! Police! Nobody move. Oh... It's fine. Looks like you really screwed the pooch on this one, dude. They were taking senior pictures for the yearbook. How could you... How could I be so stupid? He set me up. Not everything is a conspiracy, Super Cop. You slapped a fellow officer. The Collins family is getting a restraining order. You see where I'm going with this? Get some help, Cliff. No, actually... take a shower first. And then get some help. So, it's gonna be mostly cloudy with periods of sun, temperatures in the mid-70s. Friday night will bring severe thunderstorms with winds of up to 50 miles an hour. So batten down your hatches, it's gonna be a rough one. So that's where my Vicodin went. You're mixing them with alcohol? Nice. I got suspended today, so if you could tone back the judgment a little bit, that... Can't you see what's happening, Cliff? I see that Reagan Collins has killed six people. And now you're gonna lose your job over it. Can you just stop? No. I'm right about this, Connie. Okay. Okay. Oh, yes, oh. Hector. Hector! Hector! Hector! Oh! Oh, yes, right there. Oh, right there! Mommy's doing sex with Hector again. Yep. Oh! Oh, Hector, you're so big. Yes, Hector's naughty! Oh, yes! Yes. Yes. Yes, oh, Hector. Hector. Hector. Hector! Oh my God! Are they gonna be okay? Maybe. I don't know. No. Don't even get out. He killed another one, didn't he? No, the storm killed them. Wind blew, branch fell, car exploded. It's called an act of God. And that's not the least bit fishy to you? Ronnie, that's the kid's M.O. Forensic's already been through here. Come on, Ronnie, be a detective for once in your life. How many more parents have to die... - before you... - Cliff... Go home. - Officer. - Yes, Detective? Fuck you, Ronnie. Hi there. Stay away from me. Nope, I just need a minute of your time. Why can't you just leave us alone? Oh, us? Oh, I'd rethink that if I were you. That kid's a murderer. Oh, give me a break. You know Grant Hall? He's a student here? - Who? - Oh, come on. I saw you and Reagan with him the other day. Grant's mother and her boyfriend were killed last night by a falling tree. Wait, a tree? Yeah, look into it. And while you're at it, look into the Wallace twins and Sydney Vaughn and Tom Mulnick. Your boyfriend killed their parents too. Just look into it. And if you want to talk, you know where to find me. Two well-known foraging experts, Gary and Betty Vaughn, were found dead inside their home today and it may have been mistaken identity. Sydney! Sydney, are you surprised your parents made such a careless and deadly mistake? Oh, I don't know. Why don't you suck my dick? This tragic series of completely unrelated and terribly unlucky events continues to plague this upscale community. I knew you'd come to your senses. Let's go get this fucking asshole. Are you sure about this? He was so nice to me. He's dared me to catch him. More than once. I checked out all the articles online about the dead parents and you were right. He even got me to check out a book on tree anatomy. I know. I need your help. What do you mean? Go see him. Wear a wire, search his house. No. No fucking way. I should never have come here. Well, no, you're the only one that can do it. Think of those poor parents. Why me? Because I'm not exactly on the top of his guest list, but you are. Reagan. You have company. You're right, Dr. Collins, he was really cute. Such a cute face. You should have told me you were stopping by. I can't hang out right now. Oh, honey, who could be more important than this beautiful girl? I'm supposed to meet Grant... uh, a friend. Oh, why don't you tell Grant to come here? No, you son of a bitch. You know what, it's... it's fine. Actually, I'll just tell him I'll see him another time. Well, I better go. Reagan bought us opera tickets for our anniversary. Oh... Opera's for assholes. Oh, well, happy anniversary. Is it today? Yes, it sure is. So I better finish getting ready. Oh, sure. Why don't you... stay for dinner? Reagan is a wonderful cook. Mom... Do you wanna stay for dinner? Sure. I'd love to. Okay. After you. You in the mood for anything special? Steak, pasta, lobster Newberg? What the fuck is lobster Newberg? Well, we have eggs. Well, that was my next suggestion. Let's see. Can make us an omelet, uh, ham, cheese, uh, mushrooms? No, no, no. No. No mushrooms. No, no, no. No mushrooms for me. Oh, do you mind if I take a shower? I'm kind of sweaty after my run. Uh, yeah, I guess so. Uh, upstairs, first door on the right. - Okay, great. Thanks. - Smart girl. Smart girl. Smart girl. I hate you for making me do this. Where the fuck... You shut the fuck up and keep looking. What are you doing? - Oh... - Close that drawer. Oh, shit. I... I just wanted to see your bedroom. Oh, really? Well, I don't like people in my bedroom, so come on. - Let's go. - Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I know this looks bad. I was just curious. About what, exactly? - Uh... - Curious about what? Oh, wait, I left my bag. I said I don't like people in my room. Come back here. - What is that? - Nothing. Let... Let go. You're hurting me. Mary, what the fuck? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Get in. Get in. Get in. Okay, give me whatever you took. Wha... how do you know I took anything? I saw him tearing apart his room. You must have taken something. Come on. Or, I... I... It's down... Murder solicitation, Tom Mulnick, September 21st. He never listens to anything I say. He's wasted all the time. And the way he looks at the girls I bring over. Shit, the way he looks at the dog lately. It's all solvable problems, Tom. And my terms are acceptable? Yeah, whatever you want, man. I just want him dead. Yes. Yes. Yes, goddamnit, I got you. W... wait, wh... where are we going? There is no fucking way I'm going back there. As if. Hey, I needed that! This is next, okay? I am not joking. Let me out. Here! Have it. Shit. You're a witness, remember that. Goddamn cheerleaders. Yes. Yes. It's Detective Dawkins. I... I don't know. He just broke into my house. Yeah, he has a gun. And... and I have a restraining order. Put the phone down. Put the phone down. Did you call the police? Fine by me. Sit. Go for Ronnie. What? Can I get you anything? A water? Soda? Maybe some deodorant? Just shut the fuck up, you skinny little cunt. Okay? Breaking and entering, with a gun while being suspended. Pretty ballsy move, don't you think, Detective? Ballsy? Ballsy's thinking you can murder those kids' parents and get away with it. Murder? I like to think I was just emancipating those kids from their home lives by exploiting their parents' hypocrisy. Hypocrisy? You deluded little psycho. No. Think about it. If a licensed physician wasn't exceeding the speed limit, his SUV's computer may not have disabled the brakes. As far as that Mr. Mulnick goes... Ahh. Ahh. It's not my fault he treated his body like a sewage dump. like a sewage dump, like a sewage dump. I knew that was you. Oh, please, I just offered the man a forty. Who wants to fuck? Don't even get me started about the Vaughns. Who's up for vegan tacos? Professional foragers who don't even know their own mushrooms? So, you're saying they did it to themselves. Well... ...except for the tree crushing Hector and Grant's mom. That one's on me. No, they're all on you. And this? And this will make for some pretty good listening. That bitch. You really think that they're gonna believe you? Yeah. I have a witness, I have a recording, I saw you tear apart your room looking for this. So, if you wanna confess now, it's good for the soul. That's very profound. You're an arrogant little turd. Now get up. And you're an idiot. You have a history of being wrong about me and I have a restraining order against you. You really believe they're gonna believe anything you have to say? You son of a bitch, I've been a cop for 15 years. Your friends out there are gonna 5150 your ass before you even have a chance to spread any lies about me. Fuck your 5150. You keep forgetting. That recording? Forensics will think you doctored it to frame me. Cliff? Connie just called. Told me about the booze and the pills. She's worried about you. Connie... that's your wife, right? How do you think she feels about all this, huh? She probably thinks that you're crazy, just like everyone else does. Open it, please. Look at yourself, Cliff. You're a mess. Don't! Turn around. Turn around! Wh... Pursuant with California penal code section 837, I am placing Reagan Collins under citizen's arrest. This is crazy, Cliff. - Help me. - Shut up. Listen to me, let the kid go and we can talk. He did it, Ronnie, he did it. I have proof. He killed all of them. Okay? I was right. Okay, Cliff. Just let him go and we can discuss this. Cliff! Put that gun down this instant and let Reagan go. Chief, I got this. Okay? Cliff, I'm gonna come up now. Ronnie, just promise me that he'll be arrested? Anything you say, buddy. I promise. Just... put the gun down. Hold your fire! Hm? No! Ronnie, I think Sam just shot me. I need an ambulance. Oh, my God. Are you okay? - Sam just shot me. - Yes. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sorry, honey, I'm so sorry. It's okay. I just... Officer Sam Pickett was cleared in the accidental shooting of 15-year police veteran Detective Cliff Dawkins. Preliminary toxicology on the detective revealed dangerous levels of alcohol, hydrocodone, and lorazepam, which authorities believe led to his unstable and erratic behavior. After speaking with family members and colleagues, investigators discovered a history of addictions to weight-loss drugs, laxatives, and human growth hormone. Poor kid. This is your on-the-scene reporter, Sally McDuffy, KFT, Channel Five News. Oh, no. This is all your fault, asshole. Whoa. You want me to go stop this? No. No, if it doesn't happen here, it'll happen someplace else. And he needs to face him sooner or later. What took you so fuckin' long? I told you. These things will take time. Yeah, well, meanwhile I'm going crazy. We didn't set any sort of time limit. Did you bring the envelope? Yeah, I brought the envelope. "Time: April 29th. Where: my porch. How: police." No fucking way! Good. Now burn it. Not... not... not now. Later. All right, now I'm gonna extend my hand. Hesitate for a moment, then shake it. What? Just shake my hand. See? Sometimes all you need is a little faith. That took guts for him to come here today. Good for him. Yeah. Hey! Hey. Uh, do you have the iPod? Oh, yeah, sure. You should have seen my switch. It was flawless. What happened with the police? Oh, they played the other one. 114 hours of Belgian folk music. I can't believe it worked exactly how you said it would. Of course it did. So, that's it then? Oh, yeah, I guess that's it. Okay then... So, do you wanna get a milk shake or something? Wait, are you asking me out on a date? Yeah. Well, my dad still doesn't trust you. Well, that's a solvable problem. - Hey! - Sweet ass. Watch it. School's out, motherfucker! Whoo! Subtitles by explosiveskull
