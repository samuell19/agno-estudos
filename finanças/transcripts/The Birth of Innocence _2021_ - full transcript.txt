Remember me. I live within you in absolute stillness waiting. Have you forgotten? Have you placed me outside of yourself? Far beyond your reach? I am here within you. Close as breath. I always have been. I always will be. Find me. You are me. We have descended from realms beyond our human memory. Our birthright is to return. The truth of who we are lives deep within us In absolute stillness waiting for us to respond to the calling of a deeper memory. The journey of awakening to our own eternal adventure begins with the Birth of Innocence. There is only life and life is forever. An ever expanding, dynamic continuum always in a state of change. Life is a force imbued with love. Its natural momentum is joy. Moving through everything everyone everywhere in both seen and unseen aspects of all creation. Nature moves in rhythm with this force. Alive with power. Alive with change. Alive in stillness. Nature's power is in its stillness. Our power is in our stillness. In our stillness we dream. We form a vision of our desire. We enact our will through focus. Our own creative power infusing our dream with life. Nature reminds us to create our dream with passion and purpose. To give ourselves wholeheartedly until our experience of our dream becomes our life. We are free to change. Free to experience new unknowns new dreams new life. Sowing our dreams like seeds, we gain experience. We harvest wisdom. Moving in rhythm with our own life force we experience the potency of cycles. We experience our own joy. When trusting our nature to dream to experience to gain wisdom and move on we are in harmony with life. Our love for life grows greater and greater inspiring us to become one with life. To dream bold and outrageous dreams. We dissolve everything we are everything we have known. A death without dying. A birth into a whole new being. A genetic leap into the vast unknown. In choosing to make this dream our reality we ride the mystery of our own deep stillness. There is only life and life is forever. Our gateway to forever lives deep within us in absolute stillness waiting. Have we forgotten? You do? No, I don't, but she wanted the tomatoes, so I was very nice to trade -Oh, alright-- -Thank you 'Cause I'm not doing any of it. -You were nice-- -You're not?- No. Lord of the Rings is so bad. No it's not! It is! It's so bad! I've never seen it. You have to see it! Okay, the only thing I got an A+ in was culinary arts. You're gonna love it! You're gonna love it! For as long as I can remember we have allowed ourselves to be planted in rows. For as long as I can remember we have allowed ourselves to be buried in rows. Have we forgotten how to live? As our memory fades, our deepest dreams can become buried within us. We begin looking outside of ourself for life for inspiration for love. What was dreamed to be a life of exploration becomes a life of repetition. We learn to comply while we wonder mostly in secret what happened to our joy? Greater realities surround us but we can't see them. We can't feel them. We become closed to them. We stop listening. We grow arrogant in our forgetfulness insisting we know how to live. Insisting that what we know is all there is to know. Without great dreams we cannot change. Without change we are out of rhythm with our life. At odds with our nature, we grow tired and resentful. Cut off from our innocence, our inner life becomes hardship, and our outer life confirms it. We develop a constant need to be built up to be stimulated. I love you! Thank you! You're perfect! To feed the many appetites that make us feel alive. But the rush of emotions dies in a moment, and then we just need more. Our human life becomes our life without thought of the greater life that even now sustains us. We may remember exactly when we gave up on our innocence. When the world around us overwhelmed our trust that who we are is enough. Seeding doubt that our dream must not be real. But where can we go without that dream to guide us? We try to find some way to orient ourselves. But no matter where we search no matter what we do we feel a deeper longing that is rarely answered that nothing outside us can answer. When do we go back in to listen? When do we become still enough to hear our own calling? We can become so lost that we forget even what we have lost. Our innocence seems like another being a childish fantasy impossible to find. To remember our dream we may have to walk back through a past we have tried very hard to bury. Separated from our own source from our own love we wither and die while life waits right inside us. It can take a great pain to wake us up a death to what we thought our life was all about. In that emptiness through that crack from a darkness we tried everything to avoid our deeper memory begins to stir. I am always close. Always waiting. Always offering another chance no matter what you have done with every other chance. I will not leave you because I am you. This deeper memory takes root and begins to grow. The more it grows the more I trust it's power. Quietly I realize this power is me. Reminders are everywhere that there is so much more to life than what I have been living! And now this unknown is all I want to know. This new life growing within me is all I want to tend to. We have given ourselves this opportunity to bring forth everything we are to love everything we are to transform ourselves into greater and greater expressions of life. We don't know how to do this. Our Innocence does. We don't believe it is possible. Our Innocence knows it is. We have that seed within us reaching up for light down for rich soil to create itself to make it's dream known. Look at our bodies: Every finger matters in our grip and in our touch. Every cell has a purpose. Every fluid carries something we cannot live without. Every organ beats or hums in infinite complexity giving us the staggering opportunity of life. We are born remembering. And this memory is always with us. In this Innocence we embrace life actively seeking out experiences and living them richly into wisdom. Each bold step makes the next step bolder. Every adventure into the unknown creates more trust for grander adventures. I am the creator of my life through the power of my own thought. Through the potency of my own dreams my life takes shape and form. I have created what my life is. I am now creating what it will become. Our own endless ever-evolving creation into the vast unknown. The eternal womb of space waiting for new dreams to be conceived for new life to be created for new realms to be experienced. Patiently waiting. Waiting for you to remember.
