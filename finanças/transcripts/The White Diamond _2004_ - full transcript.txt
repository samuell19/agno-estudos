[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the age-old dream of flying was realized for the first time in the late 18th century and like a fever dream of the ensuing mechanical age engineer's devised all manner of motorized contraptions some of them imitated the flight of birds that did not go anywhere but bold aviators had more practical dreams they would fly machines that today are known as aeroplanes some of them resembled belts with wings there were fragile and often things went wrong [Music] Aviation had its erly disappointments and groundings but that did not deter Alice from pursuing the great purpose [Music] but what to do with passengers where these planes powerful enough to carry people and if so where to tuck them away [Music] not much later stronger engines allowed for greater payload in planes were built like taxis but that was not enough in order to carry a significant number of passengers massive clumsy planes had to be built which required an array of high-powered engines but these behemoths could hardly get off the ground [Music] the real future of aviation was thought to be the airship like the highways now filled with automobiles the skies were teem with airships [Music] as the crowning achievement the German engineer Graf Zeppelin built airships of gigantic proportions they could carry a multitude of passengers on intercontinental voyages Zeppelin's began regular flights from Europe to India to Brazil to the United States [Music] the cabin was so spacious that during flight passengers enjoyed luxuries on a par with a much slower ocean liners dining rooms grand pianos even a dancing hall and then it all ended with a catastrophe of the Hindenburg [Music] [Music] the promise of the Zeppelin was never completely discarded but it took until the end of the 20th century for the idea to be revived today applying non flammable gases and with different applications in mind a new breed of high-tech engineers has emerged I teach aerospace engineering here Queen Mary University of London and this is my laboratory here we've got aircraft and what we're doing here is we're checking the safety of the structure we're bending it with a ton of load check these panels don't buckle we've got strain gauges on it and then we'll measure the deflections in there to check we don't have any distortions but the most of the work we do in here is aerodynamics and this yellow thing is a big window the flow comes from this the back of the room here is coming through here goes around onto the floor and gets up to about 100 miles per hour in there so we could test things subsonically less than the speed of sound and give us useful information about the forces and measure the forces on bodies like this thing this isn't a model of an airship or an airship body we can measure the forces on the balance but also we set up a little test here with a smoke filament coming over the top round the nose of the airship you can see the flow there coming over the top but come with me come right round here this is a smoke tunnel this is used for visualization you can see these comb of smoke filaments coming down through the smoke tunnel it's coming around this model which is a model of the airship it's round spherical with a code underneath like a raindrop the reason it's fat and round like this is so it can be maneuverable now Zeppelin's the big German Zeppelin's were long shapes like cigars and they could barely maneuver when they turn they were fast but they could could barely turn so this airship can turn quite quickly and that's the little breakthrough just just reducing the drag by a factor of two the test here isn't exactly representative because there's a thin layer there we call the boundary layer just a millimeter above the surface and that layer of air dictates the entire flow around the airship but on the big airship it will be a turbulent little Eddie's in that boundary layer and that will make the flow more turbulent close the body and the separation region it'll be closer it should be even lower drag so I'm hopeful this airship will be maneuvering from these tests I'm quite confident we'll be able to maneuver close the trees round near them and that's the important thing I want to get done in this test and from what I've seen today what we've seen here and the testing I've done the wind times I'm confident we'll have a good airship doctor Dori you won't happen to your left hand gonna be showy well when I was a small boy I had an accident I was always interested in spaceflight wanting to get to orbit and things like that and I was building a rocket town it's about 14 years old and I was holding the rocket in this hand and very I didn't understand propellants if the chemistry teacher just taught me the year before but I was only 14 and the lesson I need it was a year later about oxidation reactions and I had a spontaneous explosion but holding the rocket but luckily I live it but at that time it was a 50% chance he could have gone this way and looking on alive today so I recommend any any small children or teenagers home be careful there you mess around with rockets because I can't be an astronaut now for a long time I've had a dream of just floating or flying zooming through the air dreams during the night as well just flying through cities and through valleys and under bridges and flying everywhere just floating above the surface seeing life we need something very maneuverable and a balloon isn't ideal something like this would be much better if it could be quiet as well that's the important it's gonna be really quiet you can see here what I've got on the back is a small jet engine just enough to lift my weight we can realize our dreams this that's the thing that I've learned in this whole project is that you start from a concept you do the design and you can actually see your ideas being made and you can realize dreams it's just a simple step and it just requires a little bit of determination but you can do it you can do it whenever you want you just have to have that dream just and then just zoom up that's the thing we should let's go boy let's go fly [Music] [Music] carving north of London in these gigantic hangars most of Great Britain's glorious airships were built here dr. doreen who plans to test his new prototype [Music] [Music] [Music] so that was the first time it's flown and I think I think it on the whole I'm quite confident again prides not quite the right feeling to be honest with you throughout this whole project until now I feel quite a lot of heaviness which is quite the difference to the levity show you know I really want to have you know the airships about levity being light but I feel a little bit heavy about the situation still but I'm getting back some confidence because of what's doing it fast because the past I mean it's it's it's for me it's a little bit difficult getting in an airship again it's always brings back memories and you asked me only about safety it brings back all these memories and it was ten years ago but I still think about that constantly and it's nice to get back in the air you know if you've had an accent little bicycle anyone knows it it's the best thing you can do is get back on a bicycle what darling miss referring to is a catastrophe which befell him with an early airship he built that's why evacuation measures in this test top priority during his plan is to fly this airship over the jungle canopy and use it as a platform for studying and filming the largely unexplored treetops we chose the area of kaieteur falls deep in the rain forests of Guiana in South America here untouched landscape in diversity of flora and fauna found in perfect unity the other waterfall is an airstrip where a few in the components of the airship a large quantity of compressed helium gas and supplies for backup safety we also brought in an ultralight aircraft and an experienced aviator to fly it locals from Menzies landing a tiny settlement nearby were hired as Porter's Kiana the only english-speaking country in South America has a small population of approximately 700,000 British colonial rule brought Indians from India and Africans from the Caribbean the native Amerindian population has shrunk to a mere 3% many of these men here are Rastafarians this rough-and-tumble lot normally works is diamonds - just like Rambo we set up camp in the clearing that provided protection from high winds from the very first day where him during who would struggle with a mess of engine parts tools and wires in attempting to unravel the mess this luck would be elusive up until the very end responding this is a switch unit that then there's central just above my head and this central switch will control the tail motor and the side switches will control how we go up and down very important we did not know then that this particular switch would cause a huge problem later and then on the end will be electric motor let's get that motor out box here this is actually interesting Motors is designed by sundry cooter Lynch in England he never went to university and doesn't know any mathematics and stuff like that but he taught himself electrical engineering and it turns out the motor he's made he's one of the world's leading motors in terms of power and mass and he's developed his own kind of sort of algebra to do that but no other person no academic can understand what he's doing but he seems to know more than many academics in electrical engineering departments because this motors very very good performance the best I could find most the time we'll just be drifting with all the motors off at least I'm hoping you'll be lovely just to be above the canopy with complete silence and I just think that these is today if you not noticed that there's so many aircraft think that everything isn't so noisy and when you get a bit of peace and quiet just just quiet then you have a chance to think quietly floating about the forest in those mists [Music] of course in a way there's always going to be this at the same time in this lightness in this kind of ethereal theory feeling of floating and in this mist that'll be beautiful but the same time my mind will always had this heaviness in it it's not just the danger it's the it's that feeling of a danger but the thing could go wrong but it's still the past and I'm hoping that this project will finally I don't know at least proved that what we did way back in Sumatra was right and that but DITA blogs vision was justified in my life I've only met a few men who impressed me and and DITA was one of them he was a man that I don't have much respect for many people but DITA when you met him he was such a solid man and so generous and he was such a bloody good cinematographer he had made so many good wildlife films and when he died in in 1993 April 3rd it just seemed totally unjust because he was just the start of a major project when you make a wildlife film one of the most important things is of course to know about your subject but as I am NOT a scientist in the way of having detailed studies or have studied in detail animals or their behavior I have to refer to experts who know one of the most extraordinary characters I've ever met was AD&D Shriver the Adrian took us into the forest confronted us was the gorillas and we got charged and charged and charged again and I think and I'm sure if I would have even flinched once and would have dropped the camera would have run or turned around Adrian would have said well this is obviously not the right man to make this film aidan to shriver had this orphaned baby gorilla and one day he decided to introduce it into the forest to let it know the sights and the sounds and suddenly we sensed the gorillas were right close and Adrian stood there was the baby girl on his arm and suddenly the gorilla called in a way it had never called before it was really although there was a strange feeling it was all quiet and suddenly we saw the leaves move and it was Hannibal first who looked at us and I sensed there was something going to happen which which really we shall never forget Hannibal suddenly called and Casimir answered from the background and Adrian isn't very very nervous and we all realize this is a situation which really can end up in something terrible Casimir came and screamed and and just charged Adrian Adrian literally had no other chance and to drop the baby gorilla because if he would have kept it we all convinced that Casimir would have killed him although he knew him very well for many years why don't i filming can be very dangerous I think when one gets into a situation which is created by humans in Sri Lanka we had a situation where there were elephants isolated in small pockets of forest in amongst plantations they were shot at by people every day and so they were very very dangerous indeed so we went in there and we got into a very dangerous situation in fact the elephant ran right over me and I was very lucky to say that the camera was planned for my hands and it still kept on running [Applause] [Music] for 11 years I felt the weight of guilt about that accident it was a stupid meaningless accident and I went over it many many times in details trying to find exactly what went wrong all the technical facts chasing around like a vicious circle over and over again sometimes twice a day every day more than that never finding an answer he knew the risks he accepted his responsibility and he trusts me in my judgment and in fact shows show great respect to me and I know I'm not responsible for the detail of the accident but but but if I hadn't had the dream in the first place if I hadn't had the idea of doing this [Music] then it would never have happened I mean he would probably be alive and and filming today [Applause] it's nine point seven meters in diameter life couldn't be better he couldn't be dead ah that's your problem in there well we've got their bowel tangled up with electrical wires everything in our life is not ropes never untangle themselves they tangle up they become complex with time these human beings wanting to be untangled maybe that's our mistake to try and impose okay that just discovered when you go in there there's two electrical connections ever a male and a female connection and I'm I made a mistake and put two female connectors together so I've got to change the connector so got to go back in there and do it again yeah but should take about ten minutes [Applause] [Music] so he's gonna fill up with the 480 cubic meters of dingy Liam that's quality that's quite small by airship standards in fact this will be one of the smallest airships ever built in the world most - it's about 2,000 cubic metre so it's relatively small but for me this is a big day the gondola attaches in six places just to make sure we got all the lines everyone staying on their line it's all about confronting chaos in finding chaos is very real in a moment with a storm coming in from the northwest I'm a little bit worried it's too high off the ground and not properly secured not filled with helium so they're getting a bit nervous here whereas you can see we got a bit of a strong there just like there's a big one coming into town it's very flat out there so the next hour we're gonna find out where this airship can take the full force to this storm only a 50/50 chance quite nice actually it's quite cooling quite relaxing know that all your work is we want you for several years to destroy it in a few minutes but that's nothing that's nice [Applause] easy break any second now [Applause] [Music] the night's rainstorm luckily did not cause any damage and removed on after installing a camera we checked the airship for buoyancy against its full payload the ship is so balanced that spilling less in a bottle of water makes it lift off the ground during this test the airship remained strictly on tethers while we were doing this test one of the local men drew our attention that is a beautiful view it has the sunset and there is the balloon just floating around aimlessly yeah it's beautiful it's just fantastic I'm so fortunate enough to witness something of a gem I'm a my number of mostly and this is like a diamond nice big diamond I love this this is cool this is real good there is this big white diamond just floating around in the sunrise it's cool dedicated to my mom somewhere in Spain unlike I think this yeah this is beautiful mrs. Enid ever good morning [Music] just think about it for seconds to think about the fact you've got seven thousand nine hundred miles of rock below you right now wherever you're sitting on the planet you've got seven thousand nine hundred miles of Rock try to imagine that huge amount of rock jump gravity is a force that pulls me down you can't escape it unless you have something like a helium balloon or wings like those Swift's those Swiss have got a lovely Latin name Aaron ortus hasn't that a beautiful name the way they dive down in their free flight becoming weightless before they dip into those Falls isn't that beautiful out of curiosity our physician on location an expert mountain climber decided to have a look for himself he wanted to see the mysterious nesting place of the Swift's from the bottom of the falls the gigantic cave is accessible and has resisted all attempts by explorers we lower the camera to him hoping to gaze into the unknown later we decided not to show his footage we will show only the image from the spinning camera as we pulled it back up on a rope okay loss knowledge banks have a master schedule fun yeah we have a loss guide a month on one time to prune for diva home here in him spots listen that spam another hint ago in secretive Elster yesterday there was a casino the awful eyes tomatoes lettuce listen was exclusive even though that is calen Matsuda zone and ridiculous to copepod impossible shortly after how much Imus experience we asked an Amerindian former tribal leader how he views the cave if I had wings one the first thing I would like to know what behind the earth because there's a home of the roof where the roof and nobody knows what was behind what lies what story what what really is behind you never had wings one of my first dream is to go behind you to see what flies do we have stories like this the legend goes that behind there have huge big snakes live in deer that that protect sort of treasures like a diamond goal whatever thank you I mean that's a legend let's say that one of our climbers went down on a rope and looked into it with a camera he saw what's in there I don't think they should they ever publish it I mean what you see is yours I mean you keep it to yourself but I don't think it should be published as a wall say okay this is behind you it would last it's the whole essence about our culture what tends to we die away with rooted but what we can reveal is a legend of how cater waterfowl got its name probably before the discovery of the new world savage tribes of cannibals swept through this region the native people have found themselves on the brink of extinction kaya their leader took his canoe and plunged himself into the abyss he sacrificed himself in order to save his people since then the waterfall bears his name Kyah - Kyah is formed it is believed that his face can be seen carved in the rock by the edge of the fall back in our camp in anticipation of our first flight be closely monitored the weather a big problem is gonna be wind so we're measuring the wind speed and checking doesn't go above 2 meters per second you've got a mother yeah she's living in Spain Malaga her name is you want her to see this yeah hey mr. and miss can you explain about your family or my family has migrated to Europe early stage maybe in six isn't it I've missed them really my hope is that they do see them and they will feel so happy to get in contact with the missing brother the missing son the lonely guy we have the Indiana would you like to use this craft to fly to them wow I would like to use this craft of life to them yeah even if it takes a whole year months I would love to have this graph to fly to them maybe land on the rooftop gives them a surprise yeah it will be beautiful for me to be in aircraft or in the morning there is Marty up at their doorstep that same morning I had an argument with Graham Torrington over the accident of 10 years past we touched on issues of responsibility and principles I had to confront him myself now there's another point I cannot ask cinematographer to men this airship together with you and lesser being only to myself oh I know I'm just saying I need to test it first just don't do that you just don't do that and there's an employer you cannot ask anyone and of course I have to take existing that but I think it should be tested first by me alone and because we have a low buoyancy situation there's a lot of technical reasons to go along and there's such a thing as as Follies yes except that no it is not a funny but it would be stupid stupid about what I'm proposing it would be stupid to accept that you are flying without a camera on board and I don't think it's just a plain stupidity they're dignified stupidities and their heroic stupidities and there's such a thing as stupid stupidities and that would be a stupid stupidity not to have a camera on board mystic is my saying you just have one flight no I'm not saying that every single chance we have we have to take advantage of well I don't know do I do I have any options okay pre-flight now if you just browsin even again waxing yeah the coolness you can see the consistence leaving the fryer yeah alright okay our songs come and go stag in the house tagging of signing some kind of a bitch were they each were the inside to swallow said the commander Keith Mouse my thinking at that time not expressed to touring and was that if we had a mishap for example developed a gash in the skin of the airship which we could not repair that this could be our one and only flight this is why I insisted upon having a camera on board [Music] radios check times recorder temps switch off batteries there blah blah blah yeah I think we're ready to go our liftoff was smooth we kept the airship antennas [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] as it seemed to be going so well we decided on a free flight the holding ropes were severed but then quickly the airship got into trouble I smelled smell and saw that one of the engines had burned out and shortly after that pieces of metal and plastic flew around my ears as the propeller next to me had slammed into its protective rim we decided to drop a line and make a quick rather graceless landing [Music] [Applause] [Music] no Ford power look at the anemometer you see it nothing it's not spinning not spinning so there's no indication for me this is nightmare flight every single technical problem that could go wrong has gone wrong we had about seven independent failures the motors are overheating and they didn't do that in the prior two tests we're underpowered don't have enough power to push cords the server most the back wasn't working and we flew me the reverse rudder pedal so that made life even even more but there was a point that I had all engines running and we're running backwards and that is not a very comfortable situation to be in yeah this was not the right procedure you know you know what I now mean from my side this is not good airmanship and this is not the right testing procedures when when you fly aircrafts never flown before and these conditions okay I did that five or seven times you won't do that again when I'm here what we did not realize at that time was that a main switch had malfunctioned and reversed the thrust of the tail engine studying our film days later we noticed a strong turbulence at the tail section while all engines pushed forwards the most powerful one at the tail end was pulling backwards even though it was not so much a question of pure airmanship for touring and it was still a devastating blow but if you give up now and be it would be stupid I think it'd be very stupid not to get the ocean flowing properly sister just a question of what do you like to fly sure that'd be great more Cantonese enthusiasm please projects only thing that one of the few people it's been positive everyone else has been pretty negative if you think about it past like Mark Antony has grown up here 18 years and he's had no formal education but he's got a lot of wisdom and he knows so much and we come in here like I'm coming here with a lot of Technology misplaced this guy's knowledge is worth more than what was education in a sense the fact he knows about little plants which which which antiseptic qualities for eyes could could be could be could be a fantastic thing did the prospecting element of this project the potential is there to go can it be prospecting all this golden silver mine is a waste of time gold silver useless to us but they could be they could be pharmaceuticals curing pharmaceuticals in the canopy many biologists believe that the canopy is one of the most rich biodiverse areas of this planet and yet it remains unexplored this futile flights day and my stupid technical efforts which of which were also not following procedures and making mistakes okay I accept all that but it's just a stepping stone is this a stepping stone to much greater potential we became curious about Marc Anthony's medicine and followed him on a foraging field trip not far from the waterfall I come to these dark places for this medicine or the herbs it's good for the eyes any any irritation or so this here it's good for arthritis I use this also for like swelling and things and I have a bar that I normally use on rooms this is covered but this one has not been stitched it's the bar that either this this one here so it's very handy [Music] [Applause] I love to come to this place here I have few Falls right now it is solved and sometimes when it rains I love to look at it through this little bottle this little problem magnificently I look to their there's the wall they're kids Marc Anthony do you see a whole universe in this one single drop of water I cannot hear what you see but it's under after a week of repairs and improvements the airship flew again this day we kept it strictly on tethers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as days went by and things improved there was one dangerous dream lingering to fly the airship over the falls prudence demanded a test we're just using these balloons to test the turbulence levels above the area of the Falls we're thinking whether it's fun to fly the airship over there when I'm worried it gets sucked down by the downdraft and we've also filled these last with champagne make them Lukey boy it's an offering offerings the waterfalls and film the monster and the waterfall this is Jason he works in the kitchen and he loves to dance the second test showed the power of the downdraft even more graphically the breeze blew the balloons a griever but then the suction pulled them back for a while they seemed to hold their own but we knew there and then that any attempt to fly the airship over this would inevitably prove fatal eleven years ago Gertz dieter plugger died in sumatra in an accident in a project when I was working with him we're using a a one-man airship the small airship to film the forest canopy I flew the airship first a few times and then he flew it and it was going very well the project on the day of his accident we woke up in the atmosphere was very somber I think it's possible that his wife and him had a very big argument tonight and there's a tension maybe she had a premonition about what was going to happen we took off he took off in the morning a little bit late there were lots of delays he decided to mount the camera on the front of the airship looking back at him took off a little bit late and there was a slight wind not much it was very calm yes it flew up a river just like this calmly disappeared over the canopy it circled we could see it in the distance going across the canopy while he was filming but he started getting a little bit higher than I expected and there seemed to be a problem then we radioed him and the first problem we had was that radios didn't work they hadn't been charged properly the airship descended some way away over the canopy and one member of the team took bearings just to see what would come down he stood on a big cliff ledge he watched where it came down and then very calmly very professionally we arranged a team to go out and meet the airship but I could see the airship up on a tree perched on a tree with DITA was up there sitting in the seat quite calmly reflect I watched him sitting near some Birds passed above and he managed to lift the nose but the camera that he put the start was was caught in a branch and it wouldn't loosen and he couldn't reach it I saw him unbuckled his seat but he wasn't wearing harness and he tried to reach out to the camera we waited again and I saw this big bangs now it's getting close close and close it was it was a light blue sky like we have now but this cloud was big gray Blanc coming in and I could see that the rustling of the treetops and then it just moved in very rapidly and I could see that the the frame of the airship on the tree rocking like a Bronco and I could see DITA holding on and then something I didn't quite believe I saw it rock really hard and it broke the frame of the airship and I saw him learnt four words and fall out the tree was most maybe 50 or 70 meters high and I knew that if somebody fell from that they would be killed once worth I realized but I just didn't believe it and so I ran back into the forest it was very dark in there when you looked up it was pitch black it's just little vague lights from the light coming through but he hadn't fallen and I was thought well I must have been mistaken it must have dreamt it I waited a period of about five minutes and the others waited and freedom was when they just told me to be quiet we heard some cracking of branches and what has happened another member of the team Marcus had climbed very cleverly to it buff another tree that tree he was on was dead and breaking anyway but Marcus had climbed another dream got within two meters I found out later of data and the airship was lodged with DITA holding on to the part of the airship were part of a branch and he very calmly said to Marcus pull me over the Marcus pulled the rope towards him and this must have dislodged the airship from where it was and then DITA did fall I was standing at the base of the canopy and then I saw something I'll never forget I saw this man coming down holding his head lying on his side falling through the air past me it was like in slow motion I can still see that even though it happened very rapidly I could still see it falling and then I hear heard him hit the ground with a thud the terrible thing is it was like meat in a butcher shop slamming down on the ground the ground was soft and Petey and he we thought he was dead at first he was half buried in this peat he'd lost an eye and so he looked a bit of a mess and on the guys Rob was really fantastic people come into their own in this situation and I was just lost right the first thing I said was just Jesus Christ when I was just lost because I didn't believe what has happened but Robley he was like a brilliant nurse and he went over this guy and he and I and and we assumed his dead and as I look down at the detail I realized his lie alive because his other eye opened and their freedom is brilliant because he just in lightning speed to put dirty other stretcher we took our shirts that tied the stretch and very carefully lifted him onto the stretcher we've got him across the river with two Indian episode Indonesian Porter's and there was a mud Trek on the far side of the bank we got him there but when I got into the sort of far side it was clear his breathing was getting worse he had this sort of moaning sound but then he started sounding karma and I said to him the last thing I said to him listen something's face I did I did I just said you're looking better DITA which of course it wasn't and we lifted him up on this mud puff it's very narrow ledge and there was a terrible moment at that point where we actually thought we're gonna slip down the bank and his body would fall into the river and and four of us were concentrating hard on doing this and just as we reached the canopy height we heard him stop breathing we couldn't I couldn't look back because I was at the front and he got to the top of the road and I looked at him and I've never seen a dead body before in my life and I looked at his body and now realised he was dead I washed I washed his blood in the river from the cloth my shirt and I watched the blood go down in the river it was you the last lostalready saw with him after some more and very encouraging tests we felt safe enough to fly the airship completely free it carried safety devices such as long ropes to bail out with a radio and a GPS positioning device in case it got blown far out into the jungle our ultra light kept circling closeby finally the ship could do the work it was designed for that morning it even ventured out to the tiny settlement of Menzies landing everyone was still sleeping good morning sir Evan look what's flying there just have a look just ever look what's flying there wait it even dipped into the potaro river upstream from the waterfall [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and then we halt the airship in [Music] [Music] you dream about this kind of floating you really do after you play dreaming about flying around is the same [Music] I don't know does anyone want describe that it was today was hipomenes distill day [Music] [Applause] I could stick I can still feel myself flying around out there you know like you've done anything you still have like you'll need you run round you spin round do you feel like you're still spinning I still look feel like I'm floating my body is just lifting off the ground now [Music] honestly speaking one hell of a relief [Music] hmm I think you know the feeling you get [Music] these are plugger he knew what was happened today we felt the right thing now would be to leave dying alone and have a complete change of setting a few miles downriver from the waterfall Brazilians operated I Amand mine we were searching for a real white diamonds and why then I want some more of it [Music] as a gift during off at mark-anthony a chance to fly he seemed to be somber all this Pleasant morning I'm about to fly and surely I would like to take my ruse to get me three somewhere wrong I would like to take him on this flight why your rooster oh my rooster means so much to me or in the morning the faster it grows then crows came in when there's some change to get a pattern in such a lovely guy I will start like taking me on the spoils [Music] of course Mark Anthony did not expect to fly to Europe to meet his family something else was on his mind I should have had my rooster here with me for the world to see his name is red he has five wives five him so I get five eggs every morning I was having heard such wondrous things about Marc Anthony's friend we were curious to meet his splendid rooster [Music] there he goes he's often as well five hands I love the red is very much from the time he was little chicken he was born here on mendes landon hats its father the other elder Brewster kind of like arm controls the other hand and when he was growing up his father used to kind of beat him up to be off the hands and after he had became one year two months he started to resist his father now he's a Spanish his father from the land so he's the king of the land right now this red wisdom you know Mark Antony had this strange feeling when I landed in the village but the little a Meridian children couldn't see the airship expected to be all excited and jubilant but they're very Placid and very sort of quiet and they just it's like the airship didn't exist they looked straight through it like it's invisible I was surprised by their actions everything because Amerindians here in the hall and said yeah and I was thinking is about perception I was thinking about James Cook it's reported that when James could arriving a shipment in New Zealand the Mary's just couldn't see it they couldn't see it right in front of his outside their world of ideas it didn't exist for them
