Here, wipe your feet, will you? And oblige me that has to clean up after you. Lodgers as can't pay their rent, coming and going all day, popping in and out of the house like flies. And don't put your umbrella where it'll make a puddle either. I didn't take my umbrella this morning. Shows you don't know our London weather yet. No, down in Sussex where I come from it only rains every other day. There's a letter for you on the table. Nobody writes to me. It must be an ad. That letter looks like a wedding invitation to me. Yes, that's what it looks like. Who's it from? Dennis Bruce? - Yes, it's from Mr Bruce. - When's it gonna be? It was yesterday. You could have knocked Mrs Mackie and me down with a feather when he told us he was leaving to get married. He told me two months ago when I first met him. He told me he was engaged to a girl in Edinburgh. Oh, well, I expect Mrs Mackie thought that you'd make him forget about her. That's ridiculous. I didn't even try to make him forget her. If you had, you wouldn't have to be looking for work now, would you? Or bother about the three weeks' rent you owe Mrs Mackie. She's beginning to get worried. I've applied at all the employment agencies. I'll have a job soon. Of course, if you ain't aiming too high, I know plenty of places you could get a job like mine. But I suppose a fine lady like you was trained for something better. The doctor said I've got to be careful for a few months. Oh. My sister had her appendix out too. She was scrubbing and cleaning the very next week. Doesn't it bother her now? Nothing bothers her now. She's dead. But it wasn't good honest work that killed her. Bertha, here's a new agency I haven't been to. "Secretaries wanted. Excellent positions available. "Apply at the Allison Employment Agency." Secretaries! Sitting writing all day. Call that work? If I go there right now perhaps I'll get it. I've got to get it. Why did you come to London, Miss Ross? A London doctor was recommended to me. And you've quite recovered from your operation? Oh, quite, quite. - I'm strong as an ox. - You don't look it. - You live with your family? - I have no family. - No husband? No young man? - No. - You're sure? - Of course I'm sure. I ask these personal questions because I have one lucrative position open to a young woman with no family responsibilities, no romantic attachments. Mrs Williamson-Hughes, 190 Henrique Square. Mrs Hughes has had three secretaries from this office this year. Just as she was getting accustomed, the girl would leave her because of her sick mother or a sister to care for or a young man. This time, Mrs Hughes wants a girl who could definitely promise to stay at least a year. I'm sure I could. I have no ties and... no young man. I'm absolutely alone. Your references seem to be in order. You just might suit Mrs Hughes. Well, there's no harm in trying. I hope you're not lying in order to get the job. I need a job but I'm not lying. My parents are dead. My closest relative is an aunt in America. Mrs Hughes? I think I've found an excellent girl for you. May I send her along for an interview? Oh? You'll be driving past here anyway? Certainly. I'll ask Miss Ross to remain and you could interview her here. Thank you. I think we shall suit each other very well indeed. - Don't you, Miss Ross? - I'll certainly try, Mrs Hughes. Miss Ross seems to answer all our requirements. Doesn't she, son? - That's for you to decide, Mother. - Well, I... I think we'll consider the matter settled. That is, if the salary is satisfactory? Oh, indeed, it's more than generous. Then we'll expect you to move in tonight. Tonight? I see no sense in dilly-dallying once we've made up our mind. Do you? The sooner you get settled the better. Well, I didn't know I was to live there. Mrs Hughes always makes her secretaries very comfortable. They all told me what a lovely house you have, madam. I'm sure we shall do our best to make you happy with us. Now, you run along, pack your things and we'll expect you in this evening. And... just a little advance on your salary. - Just to bind the bargain. - I really shouldn't. Nonsense, my child. You take it and go shopping this afternoon. You're very kind, Mrs Hughes. Thank you, Miss Allison. Good day, Mr Hughes. Goodbye, Miss Ross. We'll see you this evening. We live very quietly. I expect everyone to be in the house by nine o'clock. I shall try to be there before that, Mrs Hughes. - Good. Have a nice time shopping. - Thank you, I will. - She's perfect. - There's even a small resemblance. - You've done very well, Sparks. - Thank you, madam. Peters. - Yes, Mrs Hughes? - Do you think she saw you? - No, ma'am. - I know she didn't, Mrs Hughes. See that you keep it that way, especially at the house. Well, we'd better hurry and close up the agency now. We shan't need it any longer. Dennis. - Julia. - What are you doing here? Well, I was hanging up my second-best suit. Where's your wife? Didn't you get married? Well... yes and no. We took out the licence and sent out the announcements, paid calls on friends and relatives. Somebody gave her a linen shower, I had a bachelor dinner. By that time, we were too tired of each other to get married. She didn't like it when I kept calling her Julia. Why did you call her that? Force of habit or something. Then she wanted to know who Julia was, so I told her how crazy she'd be about you if she knew you. I don't know why she should get so upset about this, do you? Well, yes, I do, and no, I don't. Julia, come out with me tonight and help me figure out why I'm not more upset. I'd love to, Dennis. Oh, but not tonight. Any other night but not tonight. I've got a new job and I've just about time to pack and get there. - I'm living in the place, you see. - What kind of a job? Secretary to a Mrs Hughes. - And her son. - Nursemaid to a child? No, he's about your age. Oh. Well, I'll take you there. Where is it? 190 Henrique Square. Oh, but I don't think you'd better take me there. Only this afternoon, I told them I had no family and... no young man. Well, I'm not your young man. Or am I? I don't know. Are you? Bye, Dennis. I'll see you tomorrow night. Friday, in the square at 7:30, right? Right! Mrs Mackie? Mrs Mackie. Mrs M's gone to the cinema, leaving me with the dirty dishes. I'm leaving tonight, Bertha. This'll explain to Mrs Mackie why I left. I got a job with that new agency. She can send a receipt to this address. Now I've got to fly. Goodbye and good luck, Bertha. Thanks. For nothing. Thanks for something. - Ah, good evening, Miss Ross. - Good evening. I'm the doorman tonight. Mother's gone to bed. The maids have gone to the cinema and... I hope you don't mind my showing you up to your room. - Not at all. - Please. - Let me help you. - Thank you. - How long will she sleep? - For all the time we'll need. These are all her things. I want all her clothing destroyed, every bit of it. - The bag too? - The bag too. Mrs Hughes, Ralph. Ralph! Put that knife away. Try to remember, if it weren't for your temper, you wouldn't be in this awful trouble today. I'm sorry. Very well. Now we've all got jobs to do. Let's do them. - Looking for something sir? - Yes, I was looking for someone. Well, you won't find them in there. They've all gone. - It seems deserted. - Oh, not a stick in the place. They left last night or first thing this morning. Nobody saw them go. I say, do you know where they moved to? Not me, sir. People often move like that. You know, sudden, like. But Julia, she would've left word. - A relative, sir? - My girl. Would you care to come and make a statement, sir? No, it's probably nothing. There must be a simple explanation. Why, of course. You'll probably be hearing from her in the morning. - Thank you, Officer. Good night. - Good night, sir. Look, Mrs Mackie, are you sure Julia didn't leave a forwarding address? I may have made a mistake in the number of the house. Miss Julia Ross left nothing with me, and I made a great mistake trusting her for the rent. She ups and sneaks out on me when my back was turned. I don't believe that. You'd believe it fast enough if it was you being done out of £2.10. Why, the wicked girl only left £2... What did you say? I said she was a wicked girl to leave owing an honest debt. Hand it over! Go on! - It's you that's the wicked one. - I was only keeping it for you. Yes, well, I'll be keeping a call for the police if you do it again. I won't, ma'am, I won't. I'm sorry. Didn't she leave a note with her new address on it? I tore it up. But you remember the number, don't you? What, me read someone else's letters? Bertha, you've got to remember. She got the job through the Allison Employment Agency from an ad in the paper. - They'd know the address. - Good girl, Bertha. Allison Agency. Well, they won't be open at this hour! Hello, chum. You know, you're wasting your time on that door. I've got to find them tonight. Tonight? Them? Flew the coop, they have. They comes and goes here faster than the favourite at Aintree. I could get an address from the landlord. I'm the landlord. When they fly the coop, I'm the first that knows about it. That's one thing about this here building. There ain't no questions asked. What a body doesn't know don't hurt them, I always say. - I don't know where else to look. - Let it go till morning. Night's no time for looking for a job of work. Night's for play. Friday, 7:30, Dennis in the sq... Good morning, ma'am, I hope you feel better today. - Who are you? - My name's Alice, ma'am. - Now, here's your breakfast. - No, I don't want any, thank you. That calendar over there, that says Saturday. It isn't Saturday, is it? It's Friday. It must be Friday. No, ma'am, it's Saturday all right. You slept all day Friday. I expect you was tired out after your journey. But how did I get here. Where is this? Why, ma'am, you're right here in your new home that's been ready and waiting for you for over a week. Expecting you every day I was, after getting the wire to say your folks had taken Sea House and wanted it scrubbed and clean. I expect they had to wait until you was well enough to travel. But Cornwall's a good, healthy place, and the sea air will soon get you well. Cornwall? But that's miles from London. In our village, that's Beverton you know, there's just as good and better than London. Now, have a sip. I must get back to London. No, you mustn't get up, Mrs Hughes. Mrs Hughes? Please stay in bed, Mrs Hughes, or you'll make yourself worse. Oh, I'd better get your husband. He's been that worried about you. My husband? Mrs Hughes? Marion, darling. How do you feel? Why, you look better this morning, much better. - Doesn't she, Mother? - Indeed she does. My name isn't Marion and I'm not married to you or anyone. I was engaged as a secretary. Why did we leave London? You haven't forgotten us again, have you, Marion? I'm not Marion and you know it. All right, dear, let's not argue. Let's just have our tea and perhaps another nap and you'll feel much better. I'm afraid it's cold. - Alice, bring some hot water, please. - Yes, ma'am. I don't know what this is all about, but I promise you some serious trouble unless you stop it immediately. You know perfectly well I'm Julia Ross. Marion, dear, please don't excite yourself so. - You'll just bring on another attack. - Attack! Attack of what? Nerves, dear, just nerves. We do so want you to know you're with your own family. - Oh, nonsense. - Marion, darling, control yourself. Let me go. We're doing everything in our power to make you well again. Let me go! If you don't stop this I'll have you arrested! Why are you doing this? It's so stupid. It's so silly. That's the woman from the agency. What's she doing here? - Alice, bring the hot water quickly. - Yes, sir. Alice, you live in the village. Then help me. I'm not his wife, I don't know what's happening or why. Please, call the police, call someone. - Help me. - Well, of course Alice will help you. We'll all help you. Now just have your tea. Alice, you've got some errands to do in the village. Yes, ma'am. I won't have it. It's probably got sleeping powders in it like the other did. Drink your tea, Marion. - Who did she say you were? - Some woman from some agency. Last week she said I was the queen! Coming down in the world, aren't you? It's a fair caution. If you didn't know she was like she is, you'd swear she was telling the truth. It's a heavy burden on Mr Ralph and his mother. They've spent a fortune on doctors. - Will she always be barmy? - We just say she's... ill. When you go to the village, I don't want you gossiping about the family. Oh, no, Mrs Sparks. I'm a close-mouth, I am. We don't want to appear standoffish, so you can answer any questions. Oh, I won't breathe a word about her being barmy. Who is it? Who's there? Don't come near me! Don't come near me! - Marion! - Marion, what is it? What happened to that? - I threw something at him. - At whom, dear? - I thought it was you. - I've been asleep. You've had another nightmare. But he was real. I saw his eyes right there, glaring at me. That's what you saw. Why, of course, it was the cat. You saw his eyes in the mirror and thought it was someone. I saw a man's hand right here on the bed. But no one could have got into the room. I locked the door. In case you walked in your sleep and hurt yourself. Then the man must still be in here somewhere. Well, you'd better have a look. If no one could get into the room, where did the cat come from? Perhaps the window. Not even a cat could climb those walls. Ralph, stop that! You see? There's no one here. You'd better take the cat away. - Clear up that glass in the morning. - Yes, madam. If you're nervous, Marion, would you like me to stay the night with you? Why did you bring me here? What are planning to do with me? Are you trying to drive me crazy? Is that it? Tell me what you're planning to do with me! - Nothing, Marion. - Nothing but try to make you well. That's all. Why don't you leave the light on if you're frightened? Good night. - Oh, Mrs Mackie, anything for me? - Nothing for you. Are you sure? She ain't had time to write a letter yet. It's only Monday. You'll make yourself late at the office for nothing. The legal profession doesn't keep me that busy, Mrs Mackie. She's had three days to explain. Women never explain, especially if they're wrong. It'll probably come in the afternoon post. - Here. - Oh. If it does come, this afternoon or any time, call the office and I'll give you another five shillings. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr Bruce. May I take the breakfast tray, Mrs Hughes? Oh, Alice, I didn't hear you. Were you looking for something? Is there another entrance to this room? Another entrance? They keep my door locked but... That's to protect you, ma'am, against yourself. But someone gets in here. If they want to kill me, why haven't they already done it? Headache, ma'am? And why not? Sleeping pills to keep me down and prowlers to keep me awake. Alice, will you help me? Will you do something for me? Of course, ma'am. If you'd go to the police for me on your day off, I'd promise to send you money back from London. You're making yourself ill. It's not right. Begging your pardon, ma'am. You have a beautiful home, nice relations, pretty clothes, everything a woman would want. - Oh, nonsense. - Of course you have, ma'am. You're letting yourself be took up by illusions, letting it gnaw at you and gnaw at you. It's all in the mind. People can think themselves into anything. Why don't you think you're getting well, ma'am? I tell you, I'm not ill. Alice, if you do as I ask... - You may go, Alice. - Yes, ma'am. Well, Marion, up and about? I'll go crazy if I you don't let me out. Forced to drink that tea, my arm all bruised. - Bruised? - I'm going to dress and go downstairs. Of course, dear. No one will stop you. The change might do you good. - My size! - Naturally. It was made for you, Marion. You needn't call me Marion now. I know you only do it to impress Alice. And if there was a Marion Hughes, where is she? Do hurry and come downstairs, dear. Ralph, you must try to be more cautious and not let your temper sway you. All right, Mother. It's lucky I saw those bruises before someone else did. I had to force her to drink the tea. You don't have to leave evidence. Stop it, stop it! No. You're not going to have this. - Marion's going toward the road. - Be careful. - Good morning. - Morning. I'm Mrs Hughes. I'm going for a walk. Please open the gate. I'm sorry, ma'am, but I got my orders. Listen, it's all wrong what they've told you about me. I'm not crazy. I don't look crazy, do I? Nobody ever said that, Mrs Hughes. It's just that you, well... need a bit of looking after, like. I'll go and phone the house. They'll be fretting about you. Oh, please don't do that. Marion. What are you doing way out here? I... Nothing. I wanted to go for a walk. I was just calling the house, Mr Hughes. Thank you. It's all right now. I'd enjoy a walk too, dear. Let's have a look at the grounds. Thank you, Evans. - Ralph? - Yes. I've been wondering if maybe you and your mother aren't right about me. I've been thinking maybe I really have been ill. - Have you, Marion? - Yes. So I've been trying to look back and remember things. What was my name before we were married? Campbell, Marion Campbell. What about my family, where are they? Your parents are dead, Marion. Haven't I any family at all? No one to visit me? - No! - Or to write? Beautiful, isn't it? Would you like to listen to the sea and hear what it says? It doesn't say anything, does it? That's what I like about the sea. It never tells its secrets. And it has many, very many secrets. I'd like to go to a doctor. Alice says there's a good one in the village. You've been to the best specialist in London. I'm a very lucky man to find such an attractive wife. Where did you find me, I can't remember? - Switzerland. - What were we doing there? I was visiting some people. You were in school. What school? Why not try to remember more pleasant things? Like our honeymoon. Yes? Someone from the village to see us. - Tell him not to let them in. - No, no, that would look odd. Let them through, Evans. Yes. We'd better keep Marion in her room while they're here. I'm the one you're looking for. I'm so glad you got my note. You're not a policeman. No, I'm afraid not. Marion, dear, please. Oh, how do you do? I'm Mrs Hughes. This is my daughter-in-law. I'm the vicar, Jonathan Lewis. This is my sister, Mrs Robinson, and her husband. - How do you do? - Perhaps we've come at a bad time? We want you to feel that the village welcomes you and you have friendly neighbours. - Won't you come in? - Thank you. This is my son. Ralph, this is our vicar. - How do you do? - Mrs Robinson. - How do you do? - And Mr Robinson. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do? Please listen to me. They're holding me here by force. I don't know why but you must call the police. I'm terribly sorry, but my daughter-in-law is upset today. Ralph? It's so nice of you, Vicar, to come and call so promptly. And Mr and Mrs Robinson too. Indeed, the whole village is so friendly and charming, why, we're quite in love with it. No, it's not true! Why doesn't somebody listen for once instead of believing her? I'm so sorry I missed going into church yesterday. Both my son and I wanted to go, but poor Marion was quite exhausted with the journey. We couldn't leave the poor dear alone. Won't you come and sit down? Mrs Robinson, sit here, won't you? - Vicar. - Thank you, yes. I suppose they've heard about me in the village. I suppose so. Gossip travels very quickly. There isn't much they don't know about my wife. There's one thing you don't know. The police will be here. You'd better see to it that I'm all right. You mean because of this note? The one the gatekeeper found? Wasn't that an awful exhibition? I could hardly look at poor Mrs Hughes. Poor Mr Hughes, I was thinking. I'm calling back. There's plenty of room up here. The husband doesn't say much, but you can see he feels it deeply. He talks about her in such a gentle way. So touching. Perhaps a rest in a quiet place like this will do her good. Their maid Alice told our cook the poor girl is getting worse. The family refuse to admit it. You shouldn't listen to gossip, but how did it happen? A breakdown a year ago. They've been to every doctor in the country. Oh, Jonathan, do be careful of those girls. Jonathan, where are you going? I forgot to ask Mrs Hughes something. It won't take a moment to drive back. I beg your pardon, sir. Have you seen my wife? Yes, she's here. You'll find her in the back seat of the car. She couldn't have made a better impression for us if we'd planned it ourselves. Everyone knows she's not responsible for anything she may do. Why don't we get it over with right now? Because there's still one last step, the most important. - What's that, mother? - Our best alibi. What do you want? That's not a very friendly way for my wife to greet me. Wife? Please don't be afraid of me. For a while today, I thought we were friends, the way we used to be. Why don't you stop this farce? It's not a farce. I've always loved you, Marion. Or would it make any difference if I called you Julia? Get out of here! Stop it! Alice! Alice! Alice! - Alice! - Mr Ralph! Marion, how could you do such a thing? She tried to throw herself out the window. - Get my mother. Hurry! - Yes, sir. And get someone from the village to put some bars on these windows. It isn't safe to leave my wife alone any longer. Quick! - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. My goodness, ma'am. Didn't you go to bed at all last night? No, and why should I? I can't sleep and I can't eat either. Take that away. Take it away! - It's probably poisoned. - Oh, no, ma'am. You mustn't excite yourself like this. Why not? Locked up like an animal with someone trying to kill me. - Don't say that, ma'am. - You're like all the rest of them. - What's going on here? - She's all upset, ma'am. And who wouldn't be? How would you like to be in my place? Never allowed out of here for a moment. They're afraid to let me out, afraid of what I'll tell about them. They don't dare let me out to the village lest people find out how they treat me. They'd love to take you out for a drive if that's all you want. It'd do her good, of that I'm sure. Why, of course. I think it's a wonderful idea. You can drive along the coast road up to Observation Point. I want Alice to go along too. I have a good deal of work to do, ma'am. - Please, Alice. - Run along, Alice. Your work can wait. Go and tell Sparks to bring the car round. Yes, ma'am. - I'll be ready in a moment. - There's no great rush, dear. You must give Ralph time to have his breakfast. - I think it's another scheme to get away. - I'm sure it is. Now you can let her post it and no harm done. - But why let her think she succeeded? - Why not? It's what the villagers think that counts now. I want them to see how kind you are to her, especially after yesterday. Don't huddle away over there in the corner. You should sit closer, so that people can see what a handsome couple we are. Shouldn't she, Alice? - Writing to someone? - Yes, a friend in London. You haven't sealed it. What difference does it make? I know you won't let me send it. Ha, ha. What an imagination. Why should I stop you? As soon as we get to the village, you can post it. - Hello, Mrs Robinson. - Oh. Good morning, Mr Hughes. And Mrs Hughes, nice to see you out. Are you feeling better today? I've never been ill, thank you. Give me your letter, dear. I'll mail it for you. I'd rather mail it myself. - Good day, Mrs Robinson. - Good day. Just a moment. Wave to Mr Robinson, dear. - When will this letter get to London? - Tomorrow. - That's fine. Thank you. - It was a pleasure, my dear. How much longer is it going to be? It had to be convincing. Now we can make it look like suicide. - But when? - Tonight. If, by chance, that Dennis Bruce should come, I don't want her still here. - How could he find his way here? - The postmark, of course. The postmark on the letter? I never thought of that. - Why did you take such a chance? - It wasn't much of a chance. Nobody in Beverton ever heard of Julia Ross. That's true. Nobody but Sparks and Peters. I'd like to throw them in the sea too. Oh, no, they're all right. We know too much about them. It's all Marion's fault. She shouldn't have cried. Ralph, you never told me... Was it an accident, or did you intend to kill her after she'd made her will? I didn't plan it. I liked her well enough. But when she found out I'd been lying about my income, she accused me of marrying her for her money. I said of course that's what I married her for. Then she cried. She was always crying. Then she slapped me. I had my knife in my hand and I... - Stop it, stop it! - Don't do that. Put that away. Ralph, I... I'm trying to help you. I still say we should've called the police and told them a prowler broke in and killed her. With the marks of your fingers on her? The scratches on your face? No, we couldn't let anybody see her. Mrs Hughes, call the doctor! She's taken poison. Get the doctor quick. - She's what? - Poison. She's lying on the floor. - Better get a doctor. - Run downstairs. Tell Sparks to bring egg white, milk, mustard, anything she can think of. Why try to save her? Let her die. It's what we want. Don't be so stupid, Ralph. If she's taken poison, we must act as though we cared. If she's taken poison? It may be just a trick to get a doctor here. - We can't let her see a doctor. - No. It's easy enough to fool stupid villagers into thinking she's crazy, but a doctor would know better. What do we do? If she's really taken something, she may die quickly. If she hasn't... ...I'll call her a doctor. Marion, dear, here's the doctor. He's come to help you. I want to speak to the doctor alone. Go away. Yes, dear. Doctor, listen, I haven't taken poison and I'm not Marion Hughes. I'm Julia Ross and I can prove it. If you'd only believe me for just a second and call Dennis Bruce in London, he'll tell you all about me. - Then you really didn't take anything? - No, I just said that to get you here. You've got to get me away, to a hospital if you think I'm crazy, or anywhere, just to get me away from here. I know I sound crazy, but that's what they want everyone to think, because he killed his wife and she's lying at the bottom of the sea, and now they have to have someone to bury in her name. What makes you believe all this? I heard them talking. If you can only get me away from here for a few hours, that's all I ask. Till tomorrow morning. Then Dennis will be here and your responsibility will be over. My dear, this is all very puzzling. How do I know this friend of yours will ever get here? I got a letter off to him. They thought it was just a blank sheet of paper. But I had a second letter. I fooled them. I really sent that. - When did you post it? - Yesterday, it ought to be there today. Enough of that, Peters. Peters... Then you're not really a doctor? - I told you not to let her post it. - It may not have reached him. Peters, you must hurry up to London and get that letter before it's delivered. Take the car and drive as fast as you can. - I don't know where he lives. - Dennis Bruce, 51 Carrington Street. Dennis Bruce, 51 Carrington Street. I brought Dr Powell, Mrs Hughes. - We're not too late? - No. Did you find out what she took? She didn't really take anything, Doctor. She admitted that she just meant to frighten us. Oh, I'm sorry you've had this wild goose chase. But now that you are here, perhaps you'd take a look at her. - You might give her something to calm her. - Certainly. Marion, open the door. Go away. I don't want to see anybody. But, Marion, dear, please. Don't be afraid. The doctor won't hurt you. He won't hurt me, he'll just kill me. That's what you want him to do. You all want me dead. It's hopeless, hopeless. She'll never recover. Oh, Doctor, what are we to do? She thinks we're all her enemies. Tried to kill herself she did. There's no use trying to see her now. She's too upset. I'd suggest taking her to the hospital and keeping her under observation for a while. Oh, but... my son refuses to have her taken away. Yes, but for her own protection. I must try to persuade my son. He's so devoted to Marion. But if we say it's just for observation... Then I'll make all the arrangements. Possibly I could come for her tonight. Oh... I think it would be better if you waited till the morning. Very well. - I hope we can help her. - I hope so too, Doctor. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mrs Hughes. Ralph, the doctor will come for her in the morning. She'll be ready. Oh, hold your horses, hold your... Yes? - You have a room for rent? - Yes. Third floor, back, 20 shillings a week. Pay in advance and no cooking. - I'll take a look at it. - I'll send the girl up with you. The doctor says I've got to spare myself as much as I can. Bertha! Bertha? That girl's never around when she's wanted. Anyway, it's a very tidy room and as quiet as a tombstone. That's fine, I'll take it. I don't have to see it. - The children and I will move in tonight. - What children? My two little girls. You'll like them. They're full of life... Sorry, but I never take children. Anyway, the room's taken. I've got to have a room. I've been turned out. Try down the street, Miss Ellingsworth. I think she takes them. I'll rush down there at once. Thank you very much. Children and dogs. Whoever heard of such a thing? Mr Bruce... That's funny. That's funny. Why, that letter was here a minute ago. Why, there was only him and me. Here, wait a minute. Hey! Hey, there! Here, stop that man! Stop him! Stop that man! Police! Julia. Julia Ross. Julia? Dennis? Julia, hurry. - Dennis? - Yes. - I'll wait for you downstairs. - Oh, yes, I'll hurry. Where are you, Dennis? Dennis? Down here. Julia, hurry. You're not Dennis. Who are you? Why are you calling me Julia? Why don't you answer? - I told you she'd recognise my voice. - I thought she'd be too excited. Well, she's saved us a lot of trouble. Now that it's happened, I'm frightened. We have nothing to fear. We'll be telling the truth when we say it's suicide. Yes. Who's the weak one now? Come, let's go down there. Mrs Hughes, I've had an emergency call. It will take me away all day tomorrow. I'm so glad you're here. She must've heard us talk about taking her away. She threatened to kill herself before she'd be locked up. - But she hasn't...? - Yes, and I blame myself. Well, should we all stand here talking and doing nothing? Nurse, I'll go on down with them. You telephone for an ambulance. Yes, Doctor. Ralph, hurry. Get down there before the doctor does. She'll surely be dead, but just in case she isn't... - Come along, Mrs Hughes. - Yes. Thank you. - We thought you'd do that. - You were right, sir. We wanted to see what you'd do when you found her alone. But I don't understand... She jumped from that window. No, I only threw my robe over to make you think I'd jumped. Then I got out through the secret door. It's lucky we met her on the road. Marion. Marion, darling, I don't know what to say. You're both under arrest. We caught Peters in London. - Peters? - Yes. - Stop or I'll shoot! - No! No! You know I've made a resolution. The next time I apply for a job, I'll ask for the references. - I know a good job. - Secretary? A combination: secretary, nurse, companion, housekeeper. That sounds like a wife. Well, how about it? I'll have to have some time to think it over. - How long? - Oh, about five seconds. One, two, three, four... What?
