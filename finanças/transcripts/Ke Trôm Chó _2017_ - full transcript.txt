Mister! Mister! My death is unjust! Please help me! Please help me! Balut, duck egg, quail balut, grilled chicken egg, grilled sweet potato, grilled rice paper, grilled bread… Are you planning to wake up the entire town? How much is a quail balut? Ten quail eggs, 12,000 dong. How much are ten baluts? 5,000 dong for a balut. Grilled yam? Grilled yam, 6,000 dong for each. And the corn… Fried corn, 7,000. Grilled chicken egg, 4,000. Mixed rice paper, 8,000. Grilled rice paper, 10,000. - Grilled banh mi, 9.500 dong. - Fine, stop. All I have left is 15,000. I just moved in here. Just do me a thing for the ritual. Please forgive me. There are recent reports of children kidnappings in HCMC. When the mother found out, she and her child were killed. People must be on high alert for this extremely dangerous criminal. Lawyers and general public opinion has suggested their execution and removal from society. Next is the late night story program. Inside a pitch dark room. A young man was sewing quietly. Suddenly a strong wind blew in. Leaves rustled outside. The young man felt a shiver down his spine. He looked round… And stood up. There is a clap of thunder. It was raining. Suddenly, a woman's shadowy figure appeared from behind him. Her hand was dragging a bag. But the young man did not see her! He wondered why the door was opened. He was surprised! He took a look outside. But nobody was there! Puzzled, the young man shut the door! He saw a red blood stain on the floor. He felt as if someone were standing behind him. He looked behind and saw a woman with her face covered in blood. Sorry, read a bit too fast. He did not turn around, but bent over, bottom up. Mister… It's a ghost… Have a good night. Lucky, no broken teeth. Hey, mister! Ghost! Get off me! I'm not a ghost! Everyone! They took my Tin. I cannot live without my son. Please help me find him! Fan out to find him! Quick! Find him! Tin. Where are you? Nighttime newsflash. After kidnapping the child. The perp tried to hide in a house. When they found that he was really a woman, the kidnapper started begging the owner. Please do not tell them about me. They will kill me if you do. But the owner is a righteous hero, determined to capture the criminal. I am not afraid of evil. I will bring you down. As the criminal had no way out, so she killed the owner. Hey sister! You can go, please leave. I am not a police officer. But I hope one day you will give yourself in. But things did not go the kidnapper's way. The owner bravely killed the kidnapper. Sister! I beg you! I beg you! That was the radio, not me. I beg you, please spare me. Begging you. I will spare you. I am leaving. Scum child-abductor, I will stop you even at the cost of my life. But I spared you… Sticky gel all over me, man. Damn. Hey. Hello. Ward warden here. Hey you! Have you seen a dog thief passing by? I… I see your light's still on. Have you seen a woman… or a suspicious man? It's… because I forgot to turn the light off. Oh, sorry then. Remember to lock the door well. Lots of robbery in this area. I see. Thank you very much. I really hate people who steal dogs. Luckily, today's a full moon. I will let you go. I am very grateful. I hope you will abandon this life of crime. This kind of life is immoral. Immoral means "I'm moral" right? Just kidding. Thank you. Gosh! Hey! What are you going to do to him? Kick him in the head. What? What was that? What happened to him? I caught him off guard, put him in the bag. Knocked him out with a rock. Who'd have known he was still alive, though. What'll you do, then? Take him to the slaughterhouse. Who would eat that bony dog? Really? Your educational level is under fifth grade, is it not? A dog this size steamed together with rice will make a heavenly dish. Cook it and drink all night. How about I cook you? Let me keep him. Okay, fine. Take good care of him. Don't let him run around or run into me Otherwise I will return him to you. Bye then. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. - Kiss you. - Hey! - What are you doing? - Smells good. So handsome I could kiss you more. And you say you're a dog thief. - Yes. Grandma. - Are you coming home this weekend? I… I have a lot of meetings this week. - I won't be able to make it, Grandma. - Is that so? - Then please do your best at work. - Yes. Don't forget to take care of yourself. I will. Who are you talking to? Did I hire you to chat on the phone all day? I'm sorry. Tonight, everyone takes extra shift in order to reach the target. Have fun, alright? But sir? We take an extra shift every day. Why don't we have late night snacks? Do you work with your hands or mouth? Sir. Last month, we worked overtime a lot but the wages are low. It's been over a year since I worked here and still no word about insurance. If you can't take it, then leave. People are lining up for a chance to work here! Damn that manager, who does he think he is? It's just not my time to shine yet. Drink with me. Forget about this world. Balut, half rotten egg, quail egg here… Stop! Here is 15,000. Give me the best you have. The rest is a tip. Are you so ugly you must always wear a mask? Are you married? Marry me! No need to work anymore. I will support you. Ouch! Second act. After the girl was teased by Ghe. She was frustrated. Knife in hand, she intends to end the life of the foolish young man. As she enters the room, determined to end the pervert's life. Please don't kill me. Give me a chance to atone, please. Please give me a chance. Please! Please, I won't make the same mistake again. I beg you. I won't ever provoke you again. What the hell, man? It's me! Remember me? Want a reminder kiss? - Son of a bitch. - Ouch, man. This your idea of a joke? What are you talking about? Dog blood all over you again? It's my blood. They caught you? Serve you right. No! Another dog thief did this. Say again? Dog thief meets dog thief, dog thief steals dog, so dog thief beats dog thief into a pulp. No learned man at any level could understand what you just said. I was right about your educational level being under fifth grade. Think you're better than me? A bachelor's degree is worthless nowadays. Same for college. Only highschool counts as professional. Just a highschool diploma. Complementary school. That's even worse. Complementary program in a center of continuous education. That's not in the regular education system. I see you got a lot of certificates here. Anyway, just stopped by to see how you and the dog are doing. You can help the dog, by staying far away from him. I noticed that you often stay up late, sewing and sewing for those few wages. Let me tell you what. Go with me, if you got my back, I'll give you eight hundred. Go with you? I'll either go to jail or get bitten by a dog. Stealing a dog is no serious crime, you won't get arrested. The worst is a fine, then they let you go. You even studied the law? Man, you gotta study the law. Here… Keep my business card. - What? - Think it through and call me. Business card from a dog thief? Of course. Professionalism is the key to success. Good technique and most importantly put your soul into what you do. Understood, boy? Miss! Isn't Ghe visiting you today? He told me he was busy with some meetings. You are fired! Get out! Hello, sir! You have a bachelor's degree but didn't say so in your CV. I… Not only did you violate the rules, but you also often make complaints. Take a look. You are officially fired. Leave this room now. What were you thinking? If we followed the building plan we wouldn't be left with a single penny. What was I thinking? What I think is that you people disgust me. - Fired! Fired! Fired! - Hey, stop! Are you insane? It hurts! Are you insane? Are you ok? Did he scratch you? Don't show me that ass again! I will kill him at first sight. Calm down. We are civilized. We should behave so. I'll tell you this. A bachelor's degree is worthless nowadays. I was at a complementary school. Are all complementary graduates barbaric? Ghe! Oh good heaven above. Take anything. I just have this motorbike. Please don't kill me. I'm just a passerby. - What are you looking for? - My buddy's body. It's me. Is that you, Ghe? - The heck are you doing? - Preparing to steal some dogs. You steal dogs while wearing this, with this? That's not all. I've prepared for you as well. Pick one! For the love of heaven! Those cartoons really had a bad influence on you. Are you serious? Looking like this, carrying these around. They're gonna beat the crap out of you then throw you in jail. You nuts? This is holding illegal weapons. But we need something for defense. Defense my ass. We need normal clothes, to blend in. Get inside! My god! All these deadly weapons. What the? Aren't these wood? Are you kidding me? Go put some real clothes on. You look like an idiot. Really an idiot. First you need to be brave! Make no noise as you move. There are two methods. One, attack the dog from behind when it's unguarded. If that fails the second is making it bark, when it does, strangle it and put it in a bag. Only the professional can employ this method though. Here. Go get him. - What? - I'm not sure I can. Watch and learn then. I come and go like the wind. Ghe! I need support! If you couldn't do it he's gonna eat me alive. - Tell him to stop! - How can I speak to a dog? Get the owner to tell him! The owner would probably kill you themself! I have some urgent business. Den, I have to go. - Forgive me! - Who is that? Go check on Milu. Why is she barking so loudly? She must have a toothache. Don't you forget this face, dog! Don't you forget my face, dog! - Don't forget… - Stop yelling at the dog. - People are coming! - Ouch! He bit my ass. Get on, they are coming! Balut, half rotten egg, quail egg here… Miss! I'm buying. I have 15,000. Miss! Please accept my apology, I was drunk last night. I would be grateful if you could overlook it. I'm still curious about your face though. Give me a second. I forgot my money. Ah… I forgot. Miss! What about my change? I thought you gave it him free. I told you to capture the dog, I don't like him! Strangle him with the rope. Really! - I told you to strangle him. - Dog thief! Dog thief! Dog thief! Dog thief! That's cruel. Just let him go! Step on it, they're onto us! For heaven's sake!!! I'll tell you what! It's not charity work. We are trying to make ends meet. This is our only way to put bread on the table, you hear? But that was too inhuman! That was inhuman? Inhuman? Tell me who is inhuman when a bunch of people gang up on you. If you want to do charity. Go back to your humdrum job. That's probably best for me. I'd rather live as a low wage worker with sympathy. Than be a dog thief, a criminal to make a living! I'm sorry! You must look down on me. You think… that I'm a thug! Scum of the earth who steals dogs for a living, don't you? I'll have you know that I'm a bachelor as well! I graduated from law school. My parents passed away in an accident while I was in university. As you know, even with a bachelor's degree you can't get a job without contacts. I had to work in a factory. Low wage, I had to take care of my four younger siblings. The burden was on me. That's how I was led to the life of crime. Considering we were in the same boat, I felt sorry for you. I won't force you to join me. But let me tell you. Your conscience doesn't fill your belly. Hot Ga. Your dinner. Hot Ga. Stay away from me. I'm just a dog thief. Balut, Chicken egg, Quail egg, Grilled chicken egg. I'm not buying today. Grilled sweet potato, grilled rice paper. - I told you… - Grilled bread, mixed rice paper, fried corn here. Balut, Chicken egg, Quail egg, Grilled chicken egg. Grilled sweet potato, grilled rice paper. Grilled bread, mixed rice paper, fried corn here. Balut, Chicken egg, Quail egg, Grilled chicken egg. Amends for last time. The banana was overcooked. The fried egg is for you and the dog. Free of charge. Balut, Chicken egg, Quail egg, Grilled Chicken egg. Grilled sweet potato, grilled rice paper. Grilled bread, CAN I GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER. I PROMISE TO BEHAVE MYSELF. Balut, Chicken egg, Quail egg, Grilled Chicken egg. OKAY, BUT ONLY IF YOU BUY SOMETHING. You didn't respond to anything I said. Are you still mad at me? I'm sorry, I was really drunk that night. A bit of fried corn please. I'll do it. How much mister? - Quail egg, Balut… - I can do it. Grilled sweet potato is 7,000. Grilled chicken egg is 4,000. Help me! Rapist! Help me! Rapist! He was hugging her. This bastard, taking advantage of this handicapped girl. I OFTEN FEEL INFERIOR ABOUT MY DISABILITY… AND THE BUTTON IS JUST FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. DON'T FEEL THAT WAY. I DON'T MIND IT. DOES IT HURT A LOT? I'M FINE… WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK? YOU DON'T HAVE TO TYPE. I forgot I can speak. Hey mister, one fried corn please. Again? I'm sold out. You live here in Saigon, Do you live alone? Where are your relatives? I'M AN ORPHAN. I LOST MY VOICE IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS A KID. Ta-da. Surprised? Took me all night to prepare this. Thank you! What happened to your hand? Den and I were fighting. No, we were sparring. The dog is not with you? Hot Ga? He's a nuisance. Men! I… I… Love you. So much. I want… I want… to help you sell eggs. And take care of you, for the rest of my life. Silence means yes. I haven't kissed anyone . It's a dog. Come quick. There's a stray dog. - Good job. - Ok, ok! Oh, my baby my baby. Thank you for saving my baby. She's all I have. I love her like my own. Hahaha, today is a joyous day! Thank you for returning the dog to me. Did you know that I raised many generations of this dog? From her grandfather to her mother and now her. Are you happy to see me? Come to papa. Come to papa. Go home with papa! She's still in shock. She hasn't recognized me. Come here, my baby! This dog belongs to… She hasn't recognized me. My baby. I can't believe there can be such a double. She looks just like my dog. It leads to unexpected mistakes. But I think I will be fine, no need to inoculate. I don't think so, she infected the last five people she'd bitten in the past. Emergency, doctor! Emergency! I'm infected. Buy one please, ohhh so handsome and so pretty, buy one please. One ticket? Number five, number five! Number five! It's number two, number two I win! Congratulations, so lucky, number two, right on the money. Den. You must be mistaken. I'm Sen, not Den. Stop bullshitting me. Why the hell are you here? Poor you, must be dazed by my beauty. I told you, you are mistaken. Mistake? Take this. You idiot! You freaking dumb son of a bitch. Son of a bitch, right where the dog bit me. I can't even walk now. How can I get on stage like this? I forbid you from telling my girl about this. My life is over if you do. What? What's with the dumb face? Give me a hand, spray this on me. It's late. Spray it on my leg, not my underarm. It isn't easy to tell you what to do. Some days are diamonds, others are rocks. This feels like harassment? Rub faster. You are as slow as a snail. You told me your parents are dead and you have siblings to care for? That was to get your sympathy. So that I can get you back in business with me. And here I thought you really had that law degree. I did go to school anyway. I did went to school anyway, grade five elementary law school. What took you so long? The handsome guy. He's my friend. So handsome! Just joking. This is my father, Diem. - You little devil. - I have to go. Go, go. I saw you with your girlfriend earlier. You two look cute together. Have fun. I'll be going, then. I'll be leaving, then. - Hold it for me. - Hi Ghe! - I missed you. - I missed you, too. Is that enough? Enough. Thuy, I thought you lived in an apartment. Oh, that apartment is mine. This is my parents'. You the man, Den. You got a beautiful girl, from a wealthy family. Hey Ghe, this house is making me feel uneasy. No wonder you are so smitten with her. Hello. Come, let's come inside. This is for you. - Thank you. - Hello sir. What a well-mannered boy. Just like me. I feel so uneasy. Sir. Madam. Our daughter knows how to pick them. He looks much like me when younger, very handsome. How long have you been together? - Well, a coincidence. - I didn't ask you. How long have you known each other? It's been over a year since we got to know each other. It's all going well? - Yes it is. - Yes, yes. Any plans for marriage? No, no marriage. If not marriage, then what? Marry me! You mean her. Of course I will marry her. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to her boyfriend. But I'm her boyfriend! What? Mom, dad. This is Man, Den's friend. Den is my boyfriend. Greetings to you both. Where did she find you? In a pagoda? This is bloody hair, I can't cut it. How did you meet her? - Are you asking me? - Who else? Well, it was a coincidence. I was on a trip and Khanh Van was my tour guide. I asked for her number to woo, er… to ask her out. I think you should quit that job. The food is ready. Should we have our meal now? Enjoy your meal! - Eat. - Shall I? Enjoy. Bon appétit, everyone. Where is Milu? She's in the cage. Let her out. Feed her so that she can feed the babies. Son of a dog! I mean, I'm happy that your dog gave birth. That's right, she needs food for the milk. You should let her out. You love animals, just like me. - Thank you. - No no. Keep her in the cage, that's better for her health. I know it because I took an animal mentality course. So you have a dog's mentality. Let her out then! Yes. That's the dog that bit me recently. Why didn't you say earlier? I just texted you. Please excuse me. I have urgent business, I must take my leave Excuse us. Calm down. Did he remember me? Don't you forget my face, dog! Ghe! Den is tired. The fever. So tired. Get Den some water Ghe. Without water Den is going to die of thirst. I find it strange. A pro like you, keeping getting bitten by dogs. Even a pro makes mistakes. Even a doctor leaves his surgical instrument inside the patient. What is it? Dog thieves don't have to follow traffic rules, dude. Hey, on the right. There's a dog over there. Turn right. Where are you going? See how suspicious those two are? What… Why do you care? Mind our own business! Why does everyone think like you? If we turn a blind eye to criminal acts, we are the criminals ourselves. Now you sound like my old teacher. What else? Return lost property? Return dead bodies to their family? - They are stealing! - Stealing? Just let them go. Thief! Just let them go. - Thief! - Careful! We are gonna fall! I don't know what's going on inside your head anymore. - Congee. - Tell me. Are you a dog thief? A warden? Undercover cop? Are you paid for doing that? Yes. You think that's good. It's good! The best in Saigon. Why do you keep doing that? Those muggers, why do they even matter to you? - Matter! - Shut up! You need to stop this madness! I am sane. - Why does it matter? - You see, robbery is increasing. The people will be more watchful, wardens and police will have more patrols. How can we steal dogs like that? - God, I can't believe this. - Come on. See it as a blessing. Our ancestors will bless us. - What ancestor? - The ancestor of all dog thieves. Go on then. Give some more blessing, then they can kill you so you can become my ancestor. So give me your blessing. I'd rather be alive. You must stop this. Or go our separate ways. Okay okay. I'm sorry. I promise I won't be like that ever again. Let's go eat some congee, I'll pay! The people already hated us. Now you're even making an enemy of the muggers, who have nothing to do with us. At this rate we'll eventually be recognized by the entire town. What is it? - What is it? - What is it? What is it? - My god. - It's a blow out. Dog thief! Catch him! People are coming. - Here. - They're here. - Here, take it. - Just leave it! Run! Oh Gosh! Take them! Me too. Where are they? They're gone. Please don't hit me. Don't hit me. Hold on to the pole! Did they hit you? Did they rub pepper powder on your face? Why don't you answer me? Did the dog thief throw pepper powder in your face? Yes, they pushed us down too. You look like you're pretending. We are the dog thieves. What? I mean we chased after the thieves. Is that so? Why are you wearing a helmet, though? It's for protection. Protect the head. Really? Sounds reasonable. I'm gonna go borrow one too. That's right. That's right. - Go go, catch the thief. - Get him. That was close. Our ancestors must be watching over us. Now we just have to play along. What if they had found out? You want to go back? Just go with the flow, man. We can use this opportunity to get more experience. Get him! Faster! - The thief! Catch him! - Don't run. Catch him! He got stabbed. Oh man, they really stabbed him. Is he ok? Take him to hospital! What are you doing? Calm down! Let me go! What's wrong with you? He's a fellow thief. Our ancestors forbid mutiny. I took one from here before. There's only a fat one! My god! You already had one from them. Should we leave this one? Stupid! The other thieves will soon get here, anyway. What the! Isn't this suspicious? Door's unlocked, the dog isn't moving. He should have already sensed us. Yeah! You are right! So the owner… Must have been poisoned as well! Call the ambulance! Hey, we stole their dog. We should at least take some responsibility. Can you please stop the bullshit? Where is the bag? Put it in the bag! Is that your assistant? The owners are asleep. All good. Which one of you is Ghe? Are you the thieves? Put the bag down! Who are you to tell us what to do? Are you pulling my leg? This area is ours, do you have a death wish? We're just trying to make ends meet! Just let us go! Let you go? What's in it for us? What? My god, it's gold. What else do you want? That's for him! Where's mine? What do you want? The whole bag! Over my dead body! Help! There's a dog thief! There's a dog thief! Dog thief! - That son of a bitch! - What now? Get the dog! - Den! What are you doing? - Run, run! Run, go the other way! Go that way! I was greedy. But you! How about you? Whose fault is this? You saying this is my fault? You keep sticking your nose into other people's business! Why do the good deeds? You got us here! You may have heard about dog thieves, physically assaulting the owner to escape. But as for the case from 28th August, in Ward 7, District 8, Ho Chi Minh city. Two dog thieves are said to have stolen a lot of gold and run off. The subjects were identified as Tran Van Man and Nguyen Van Den. The case is now being investigated thoroughly. According to what you say you were planning a dog theft. But saw two people coming out from the house. If you knew they were thieves, why not call help? I… If we did, they would found out we were thieves as well. Then why didn't you return the gold? I… At the time the situation was so chaotic! I wasn't aware of my actions! You weren't aware, but you didn't forget the dog did you? It's because… Because… Because you wanted the gold, am I right? I… What the people yelled was "Dog thief" not "Gold thief". The time between the yelling, and the time you started running away, - was quite long. - I… We found pieces of gold, scattered all over the crime scene! We also found someone had tried to gather them. That means… You tried to recover the gold before trying to escape! Am I right?! I'm innocent! It's true I could have run away! But I stayed to fight the thief! To return the gold! Where is your proof? When your friend tried to take the gold, why didn't you stop him? You are still an accomplice! I'm innocent! I was only there for the dog! Your friend told us everything! Be sincere, there will be leniency! The court has sentenced! "Defendant Nguyen Van Den, Tran Van Man, to 18 months in prison!" DEFENDANT Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Hey! You guys knew? We're done for! I saw this in the movie, at first they're nice, then they wait till we drop the soap. Yeah! So what? Just asking. Did not mean to intrude. Hey brother! Don't be so tense! My friend doesn't mean to disrespect you, he doesn't mean to! You both be careful! They usually pick on a group called "owl"… Thank you! - Want anything, just say! - I don't need help! I can take care of myself! Are you nuts! He seems kind. What's wrong with you? No-one here is good. Den, oh Den! I'm always telling you to quit that thieving life! Why would you do something like that? The dog is a loyal animal! And you killed it, in cold blood. Dogs are loyal? Some humans don't know loyalty! You mean… But… It's been so long since what happened! But for me! It's just like yesterday! Please don't leave! I beg of you! Den is too young! I beg of you! - I've had enough of you! - Please don't go! Ever since that day! She hasn't returned at all! In the past. Your grandfather. Wanted a grandkid so badly. So I was forced to marry your mother. You should understand your mother! We, we can't be selfish. We should let her live her life however she desires! Shouldn't we? Why didn't she take me with her? I beg of you! Let me take care of Den! I couldn't take good care of you! I let you turn to thievery! I am at fault! It's not your fault! Nothing to do with you. - I have to go. - Den. Den! Den! I'll kill you! I'll kill him. What was that? - What was that? - Gosh it's midnight. Just sleep! What happened? What are you screaming? I was… It was just a bad dream. I'm so sorry! Go back to sleep! Don't make a noise again! Move faster! Quick. Move faster! - Are you blind? - What happened? Why are you yelling at me? - What? - Stop! Are you new? So? Like to play tough? So what? This doesn't concern you! I just don't like what I'm seeing! Get out of here! You are lucky today, kid! The boss can't protect you forever! Is your hand ok? I don't need your help. I can take care of myself. Let me ask you a serious question. What did you do for a living? You are really brave, you know? He's not as he seems. He's just a panicky boy outside. He's like a different man when he came in here. Dear god! Everybody has tattoos. Look… Dear me! Why does everyone have tattoos? You too. - Me? Tattoos? Where? - Your eyebrows! Shut up! But really. You were loud outside, why so timid now? This is the prison, the prison, you understand? One false move, and you're done for! Once you're here. It doesn't matter who you used to be. You are but a prisoner here! - Brother! - Yes? Is there a way for me to share a room with you? What room? Prison cell. I mean! In the same cell! What for? I couldn't sleep at all! These faces give me nightmares, I feel better with him around. Don't worry, I'm here! Thank you! Brother! You really are a good guy, how can you be here? He doesn't mean it that way. Den is right. Your appearance says nothing about you. It's what you do! - Then, can I ask you this? - Go on. You don't seem bad to me. So how come they put you in jail? - It's a long story… - Eyes forward, move faster! I wonder if Ghe is ok? We should visit him! I want to spend my life with you! Stand up! You the new guy? So what? Still want to play tough? What if I do? Stop! Okay? Officer! Miss Nam! Fire! Fire! Help me! It's burning! Miss Nam! Miss Nam! Help! Help! Help! I'm sorry, boss. Brother! I have good news! News? Den and I are getting out! We're getting out! Thanks for all you did for us! Getting out? So soon? It's nothing! I was… I understand! Please understand! If we stay here forever. No one will take care of our loved ones. Then… Congratulations to you both! We owe everything to you. Us two. We will never forget what you did for us. You're both still young. You have a future ahead. Try to make the most of it and lead a good life. We will! Yeah! You can rest assured! I'm a different man now! Did something happen? Don't tell me… You have somebody else! Your grandma passed away. It can't be! She was fine when I was first imprisoned! She was very ill, but she didn't let you know. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Let me go! Let me go! Grandma! Grandma! Let me go! Let me go! Grandma! Go away! Get out of my sight! Grandma! - Grandma! - Let me wash you. Grandma! Good boy! Let me wash you. Is it good? It's delicious! But a bit burnt. Burnt? Burnt my ass! You little monkey! Are you coming home this week? I don't think I can make it. Remember to take good care of yourself! Hey! Why haven't you met Men on her recent visits? Are you listening? Ghe! We are free! Free! Freedom, Ghe! Den! - Den! - Father! I miss you so much! Hey, Ghe! - Ghe! - Ghe! Ghe! What the heck! Where are you going? Nobody came for you? Where are your relatives? I have no one. What about Men? Nobody came to pick you up? Then come with us! It's not much, but it's better than nothing. Ghe is back from prison. Uncle Ghe is back from prison. He's well educated. But instead of leading an honest life, he chose to steal. It took you so long, Ghe. My son! You're young and you make mistakes. It's just, your grandma was very upset. Miss Nam. Where did they bury her? All the town contributed but we could just afford the coffin. Let's wait for the flood to pass. Then we can make her a proper resting place. I can do it myself. I don't need help! - Stay away from me! I'm just a dog thief! - My god! I don't need your pity! Ghe, what are you doing? I don't pity you. I love you. Ghe, you just need a fresh start. Nobody will remember your past. No matter what I do, it won't change the fact that I'm a thief! You still have a chance. What's left for me? I don't have any relatives. You still have your father. My father's dead! He's alive. He always cares about you. He's a murderer. - How did you know him? - God! - How did you know my father? - God, calm down. Where is he now? Calm down. I'm telling you! During that time it was Men who took care of your grandma. Who is my father? Where did you meet him? Answer me. Someone sent you this. I am Ghe's Father. Fire! Miss Nam! Please try to admonish Ghe. I don't believe you! I don't need anyone's help! Good heavens! Men. It's just his temper, let it go. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Hey dad. How's the lottery business? It's no more. - No more? - Just eat. So chatty. Is it really? Why dad? That lottery company was your source of income, your passion, your way of life. Why give up on it? Business is just not going well these days. The market is too sluggish. And I'm too old anyway. I'll take over and rebuild the company. But I'll do it in a different way. Just believe in me. I'll make a lot of money. I'll build you a nice resting place. Rebuild the house. People will stop condescending! I promise. For your next anniversary. I'll prepare pork and beef. So that you won't feel lonely in the afterlife. I think, you only have to rethink your way of life. That alone is enough to make your grandma happy. You think by offering beef and pork, she will be happy? Killing is a sinful act too. So you're free today? Have you found a job? Hey… Is something wrong? Drop the act. You don't have to pretend. You think that being nice to me is enough for me to forgive you? I won't ask you to forgive me. I only hope that you can forgive yourself. Who are you to tell me what to do? You're a convict. A murderer. Who murdered his wife, his own child. I only wish that you live and become a good person. A prisoner telling a free man what to do? You may be outside. But I can see that your heart is locked in a cage. For over twenty years I have been paying the price. That's how I know. You tell me. For over twenty years. I could never forget that day. Die. You will die with me. You. Are you drunk? Dept. Social animosity. What's there to live for? I will die with you, but leave our son be. No. No. Live together. Die together. We have to run. Go, go. You! You! What are you doing? We will all die. Stop it. We die together! Nam is here. Why didn't you just die then? I wish that I could have died that day. - You. Why are you letting him go? - I'm sorry, please forgive me. I said we all die. We all die together. Die with me. Save Ghe's parents! Help! Help me! Water! Water! - Help! - Save Ghe's mother! That was my greatest punishment. My life is a living death. What happened that day still haunts me every single day. I'll kill you. I'll kill you, murderer. I'll kill you! Murderer! Murderer! - Mom! - Ghe. - Why was he saved? - Ghe. Mom! Murderer! I'll make money. Grandma… Number twelve. It's number twelve. Who won? Who is the winner? This handsome guy? What will you take? Cooking oil? To lubricate or to cook with? Is it you Ghe? Are you going to quit that career? I'd wouldn't call it a career. As long as it puts money in my bag. For god's sake! We just got out of jail! Now that we're free we should appreciate it. I do appreciate it, so I won't let anyone look down on me now. Ghe, listen! You are a good person, stop doing the wrong things. What's the point of being a good person? Let me repeat what you once told me. A dog is just like a pig, a chicken or a duck raised for slaughter. If you don't, eventually somebody else will. This lottery stand, how much do you earn a day? Please Ghe! Don't you know what your grandma wanted? She wanted you to become a kind and honest person. That's how she wanted you to be! My grandma is gone! It doesn't matter to me what she wished for. Don't be so pessimistic. I'm here for you, Men is here for you, there are still people out there who care for you. I need money now, and money doesn't come from kindness. Balut, duck egg, quail balut, grilled chicken egg, grilled sweet potato, grilled rice paper, grilled bread, mixed paper rice, fried corn. Balut, duck egg, quail balut, grilled chicken egg, grilled sweet potato, fried corn. Congrats! Balut, duck egg, quail balut, grilled chicken egg, grilled sweet potato, grilled rice paper, grilled bread, mixed rice paper, fried corn Balut, duck egg, quail balut, grilled chicken egg, grilled sweet potato, fried corn. Bro! Need a ride? I'll give you a discount. No, I mean I'll take you for a ride. Not asking you to ride me. Nonsense! Hey bro. You know that sister over there? Why don't you talk to her? - I don't know her. - Then why are you stalking her? Oh right, that's why you're stalking her, silly me. Talk less and mind your own business. The cyclo drivers are all talkative, deal with it. - Thief! - Stop! - Hurry! - Where is he? Quiet! Shout and I'll kill! She is good. Quick, bro. No. Hurry bro, my turn. You are so pretty. No wonder that guy stalked you. I'll pay, no need to put it on the tab. I have money. How does he look? You can't talk? Mute? I'm so sorry. You know. He's about this tall. Nice eyes, nice nose, nice mouth. Pretty handsome overall but looked quite intimidating. Who is it? I'll call for help if you don't show yourself! Who is that? Dog thief… There's a dog thief, help! Help me! You've sent me a lot of money! I want my grandma's grave to be the biggest. Listen, I'm not sure why but the roof and the base tend to sag a lot. In the city there are 80-storey towers, and river bridges, and none has collapsed, let alone a grave. - Those builders must be corrupt. - You be quiet! People here are honest and kind, unlike you urban people. The nearby graves by the same people, are fine. Who told you city buildings can't collapse? The newspapers said otherwise. Alright. Don't be mad. He just loves his grandma too much. If he does, tell him to build it himself. Isn't he a construction engineer? Why be a thief? The price was already fair. But it just keeps collapsing, and we look bad. Is it… because you're still angry about something? ANOTHER RAPE VICTIM Lottery ticket? You almost gave me a seizure! I was calling you in a normal way. But don't you remember me? Aren't you the talkative cyclo driver? Yeah, it is indeed me. But I'm not talkative now. Where is your cyclo? I drove into a no entry, so the cop took it. It's 2013, who would take a cyclo anyway. Follow me. I'll give you 800 a night. - For real? - For real! What are we doing? - Stealing dogs. - No, no, no… - Not enough for you? - No, I'm not doing this. Afraid of cops? The worst they can do is take you in for a while, pay the fine, and you're free. I'd rather stick with the lotto tickets than… than be a thief. Things like that… too cruel and immoral. Does your conscience do anything to keep your belly full? Right! I sell lotto tickets since I'm uneducated. But I do nothing illegal. If you can't lead an honest life, why go to school? Hey! Don't you dare teach me how to live my life. Raise them and feed them properly, then you can sell them for a profit. We gather them here. Take a few months to fatten them up, then profit. That's a lot of dogs. Who can eat them? The whole country. This isn't nearly enough supply. That's why there are dog thieves. I even have plans to export dog meat. Who would eat this skinny dog? They can eat them all. Skinny or not, they'll all look good cooked. That's about fifty or sixty million dong. Yes, about that amount. But… Even with all that, how can it help your grandma? She's gone? She lived a poor life, even in death, she couldn't have a real grave. Suit yourself then. I just wonder. What did you do to earn this much? I'll call you if anything comes up Why did you run from me? I'm not running from you. I'm running from me. You are now someone to look up to… I'm just… If you really think you are a thief, you'll forever be a thief. - Men. - Ghe. If it is me who led you down this dark road, then for me, please turn back now. I'm sorry, I can't. Ghe! Den was just like you before, but now he's changed. Please don't think money matters most, there are more important things. You're right, but I've lost all of them. PLEASE HELP ME FIND MY DOG Are you ok? Let me take you back under the bridge. How can you find the ransom for the dog, why ransom it anyway, one more mouth to feed. Do you know why I lived for so long? Because it's like my child, my eyes when I need. I used to have a wife and a son. I worked during the day, came back at night. One day. I was sick, my eyes were in pain, then I couldn't see anymore. My wife started calling me useless. She sold the house and left. My son. He… He left too… Only the dog remained with me. Thanks to the dog. I feel more secure and happy. It's worth a few hundred for a dog, just buy another one. I beg you please… please return my dog. I didn't steal it. You… you stole it, you… you… you pushed me, I couldn't forget it. How, how… how did you know where to find me? This is the money that I got for your dog, take it. I don't want the money. Please give me back my dog. Please, I beg you. Your dog is dead. Please, I don't need this money. Please give it back to me. I need you to butcher these dogs now. He's my child. My eyes. - Go with mom. - We all die. What are you doing? I told you to kill it. I just think this dog just gave birth. And… The puppy's all bones. Who would eat them? We shouldn't do it. Nonsense. Haven't you heard of steamed dog with rice? Furthermore, black dog's blood can drive evil spirit away. Bao! You do it. I want to buy them. What are you doing? Hey. I have my customer reputation to keep. Reputation? You only care about the money. I'll pay double for these. Are you out of your mind? Stop this nonsense! Get to work! Are you trying to destroy my business? I'm not. I only want the dogs. Whoever touches them has to go over my dead body! Fine! Real cost is 5,000,000 dong. Double it to 10,000,000. The mother costs a million at most. How expensive can the pups be? A million is what I pay for stupid thieves like you. My customers are the rich. Understood? - I'll pay! - I'll give you three days or say goodbye to them. Get to work! - Which one? - Whichever. As long as you tell them it's a black dog. Yeah! But what if they ask to see it? Are you an idiot? No one can tell, when you already roasted it. Yeah! But what if they ask to see its picture? But what if I kill you first? Joking! Just joking! That's why you will spend all your life catching dogs. If you don't buy this dog I'll kill it. He doesn't want you. So, it sucks to be you. What happened to you? I'm fine, but they stole Chicken Egg. Come with me. DOG MEAT RESTAURANT You need to stop this cruel job. You kept calling me. Is it something important? I came to save you. Keep calm. Hey calm down, I'm here to help. This one first. You wait. Can you save them all? - More over there. - What? We can't save them all! Who is the dog thief? Who is that? Boss, there's a thief, thief, wake up! There's a thief. Stop! Or I will burn it all! I'll burn it down. I dare you! Come and show me your face! It's you! You've got guts. You dare steal from a thief? Why are you here? Den texted me, said you guys were going to steal back the dogs. What is she saying? They caught Ghe. What? They caught Ghe and Men at the slaughterhouse. I can't hear you. I'm breaking up with you! What? I dare you to say that again! Don't hang up. Don't hang up. Don't hang up the phone. It hurts. Why did you text Men? How many are with you? You trying to steal all my dogs? Who said they're yours? You got them from thieves, that makes you like them. Yeah. My friend used to be in prison so he knows the law. Let them go… My mouth! Shut your mouth! My mouth! What the heck? Can't you see I'm a man? I don't care. I'll hit them all. You are the ones who raped and killed that girl? Free my friend or I call the police. Stop! I'll let him go. Her too. If you give me the phone. I will let her go. If you don't. I will count to three and kill her. One… Two… - Three! - Wait… You're done for… I know all your crimes. I know all of them. I couldn't be. He knew about the drugs. What do you know about me? You asked for it. Listen well then. Listen well. From… Your slaughterhouse. Out the gate. Remember. To turn left. Right to the end of the road. Turn right to road 65. To the end of road 65. Turn to road 64. Half way along road 64. There is a restaurant. Called nine dog-meat dishes. That is where, you sold the dog for a rip off price. That's right. The further away, the higher the price. That's not all. Across a bridge, under it. To the left there is. There is a… Advertising panel. Septic tank advertising panel. Then go straight. Keep going straight. To a five way crossroads. There, the price is even higher, isn't it. Remember it well. Are you crazy? Rest assured. I have revealed this place's location on the phone. Khanh Van has heard all of it. What? I couldn't hear what you were saying. Hey? You were saying the location? If you don't give me the phone now. I will kill her immediately. If you give him the phone. - We will all die. - Wait, wait. I give you the phone. You let my friend go. Drop the knife down. Run! Cops! Give up! You're surrounded. Hands up! Khanh Van. Khanh Van. Milu. I'm breaking up with you! - Gosh. - Miss Nam. Why did you get into a fight? I… How did you know that I'm here? Men texted me. God! If you could talk I'm sure you'd be a loudmouth. How rude! Hey. I have good news. Your grandma's grave is finally built. Are you satisfied? Hot Ga. Are you ok? Hot Ga. You're still hurt. I never thought that I could ever see you again. - I… - Stop … Let go of the past. Ghe has repented himself of what he did. I am happy to hear that. Don't worry. Do you remember? That I said I want to live in the same room with you? When you get out of here, come stay with me! I thank you. But… I am about to be released. Ghe. I beg you. Forgive me. I beg you. Ghe, say something. Ghe. Please. I beg you. Ghe. I won't force you. But… I think, no one, in what happened, was right. Ghe. I know. I was wrong. I beg you. Please forgive me. - Ghe. - You go with me. Ghe. You said you'd already repented. What should I say? Want me to say I love my father? You. You. Do you know why he got hurt? Are you ok? The person lying in there could have been you. I'm sorry father. Father. Father. Hello friends. How are you feeling now? You were once dog thieves. Now you're encouraging people to say no to eating dogs. At first we would like to… Send our greetings to all the audiences. I once had the thought that… Dogs, are just like cattle, raised to be slaughtered. Until I met a man named Chinh. A blind, homeless man living alone. All he had was his dog, who he treated as a friend. And I… They're humankind's best friend. We should not eat dogs. I wish that it would become a law. That killing, stealing dog. And selling dog meat is prohibited under any circumstances. And If everyone thinks like us. That will become true. I promise to live an honest life, may you rest in peace. Don't you worry grandma, I'm here to make sure he stays on the right path. Guys. Have you heard the news? - What is it? - What is it? - My God. - Slow down. Careful. I'm so happy. - What is it? Chill. - My god. - What is it? What is it? - Here. - What's that? - Take a look. Excuse me, sorry I was so loud. May I read the news to the kids now miss Lanh. It only took eight days, and already 60 million people in the country and overseas have already voted to say no to eating dogs. Even Hot Ga is happy too. It's lucky we quit early, or we'll have 60 million people to beat us up including Hot Ga here. Hey! Still want to steal people's dogs. Not anymore. - I warn you! - I know. Set your mind at rest. Hot Ga. Hot Ga. Wait for me Hot Ga. You guys promise me. Do not steal dogs anymore.
