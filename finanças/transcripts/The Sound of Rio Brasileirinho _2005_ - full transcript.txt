Around 1870, there began to appear in Rio de Janeiro musical groups formed for the most part by civil servants. They played for simple pleasure. Blending European music, such as the polka and the waltz, with Afro-Brazilian rhythms. Thus creating the choro. The first genuinely Brazilian urban music. Before samba and bossa nova. From downtown bars to big theatres, today choro is more alive than ever. At times like this, I’d rather be a dentist, engineer, lawyer... It’s tough. Afterwards it’s great... But that’s what it’s all about... I can be a finalist in an international contest, play classical guitar, but not to know how to play Brazilian music, my music... not to be able to do that... No! I want to learn this music! So I went around the bars, right? Which are, I think... the great school of choro, right? And thus of Brazilian music... And... But it was like going back as a student again, not as a guitarist. You have to be humble and go there, ABCs... And the guy plays, you can’t keep up with him, you mess up. I remember, I was 23, after the international contest, arriving there... there was a mandolin player who played Doce de Coco and I tried to accompany him, I messed up, the guy looked at me: “Who is this guy?” For one to acquire the culture of choro, in the first place, it’s not just a question of learning the music. You must learn to discuss, feel. Feel an atmosphere. The music has an atmosphere... somewhat spiritual, when you play with the musicians, right? You do something, the other responds on the guitar. I’ve even seen many people burst into tears with emotion, in the midst of... that thing... the culture of choro. Normally you learn the music first. Then you see the possibilities of the music flow, literally, with a certain passion. When we had the idea of forming Trio Madeira Brasil... it was like... Zé Paulo Becker and I both idolized Ronaldo, because at the time Zé Paulo had a truly scholarly background, right? So we saw the opposite in Ronaldo, and at the same time he was our ideal, because his foundation, was that choro circle thing, right from the beginning, of improvisation and such, right? Mother, do you still remember some songs? I have a little house There in Marambaia It’s on the beach What a beautiful sight It’s covered in grapevine In springtime It flowers Like the earrings of a princess When summer arrives I sit on the porch Pick up my guitar Begin to play And my dark-haired lover Is always singing “Carinhoso” Sits by my side Also singing When evening falls A flock of swallows Flying around Are bringing in the summer And there in the bush Songbirds are warbling Lovely melodies To rejoice my heart But when evening Falls in the favela... I forgot now... Wonderful, mother! Wonderful! It was just to get an... Smoke rises... While the wind whistles through the glass window... The symphony... No, lower seventh... The symphony... Lower the C... It’s in C# minor, ok? Then it’s seventh in the bass. C# minor... Which gives the sad note... It gives the connotation of sadness... Otherwise it would sound happy... True. Yes... Otherwise it sounds cheerful... Thanks. Listen, the show is confirmed At the Niteroi municipal theatre... - Great. - Fantastic! On choro day— Pixinguinha’s birthday — they’re going to stage a choro event. We’ll do a show with guests and all... So we have to decide. And the idea is that we greet the guests? I was thinking of asking Zezé Gonzaga to sing. Wonderful... And the guys from Niteroi, are we going to invite any? Let’s call Carlinhos? - Good idea... Silvério... - Zé da Velha... Yamandu! We could have Carlinhos play with Yamandu... - That waltz... - Yes, it would be great! Guinga... -Yes, Guinga! Can you, Guinga? - On the 23rd, can you? I can’t because I’m eating chicken... And now, what about the Barca do Choro? After the chicken I’m ready for anything. After the chicken... Have a good concert. In the seventies, the Camerata Carioca appeared, a band formed by a new generation of musicians who, along with Joel Nascimento and Radames Gnatali, significantly revamped the basic concepts of choro. Unlike his new companions, Joel Nascimento held another job besides that of musician. I heard you’re going to make a new record? What’s happening? All that’s left to do... is to sign the contract with... No kidding? ...with the record company now. To sign the... Don’t move! Stay still! Hold your breath. Don’t move! You can breathe now! Take a look over there! - See if you can see that score... - Hey you crazy guy! It has Pixinguinha written on it... There! Can’t you see? Pixinguinha! There’s over 200 songs in it. One can’t see the brain here, the things inside, but so what. One can’t see the neurons, but I can truly see the notes of my choro in your head. - Really? - Yes, Ecos... Fantastic! I really like that choro! Let’s get the hell out of here, pal, it’s really hot. Really hot. This dark room... Joel, it’s madness to work in here, right? Yes... but I worked here for 25 years. I’m a musician, a mandolin player, I awoke to the world of music when I was nine, through a fantasia about Chopin’s life... many people, by the way, awoke to music through this fantasia. I was born in Penha, in the midst of music, in the midst of choro, the first instrument to come into my hands was a cavaquinho. And my head was full of Polonaises. Inevitably, I studied piano. Because of a hearing deficiency, I had to give it up at 22. Along with other music studies. I have a deafness problem, I lost hearing in my right ear, to this day I only have the use of one ear, and I have... a problem with frequency. This part of the piano from here to here... I hear like this... so I play one octave higher, to keep it in my head and check my fingers. So I realised that I would not manage to become the concert pianist I wanted to be, and I gave up piano. I stayed away from music for ten years. The mandolin story is something else. I see it as some sort of imposition but it became part of my body, a part of me... today I have come to love it. Thank God for this. Suvaco de Cobra! What a joy to return here, I always feel deeply moved when I pass through those two doors. Suvaco de Cobra... The shrine of choro. One of the last great shrines of choro during the seventies. Through those doors, through those walls, you can hear the music, it’s all there and tells the story. A beautiful one. You look at the floor... it’s really moving. This is Abel Ferreira, who composed the chorinho of Suvaco de Cobra, which I recorded for my first record. Here is Waldir with the late Índio do Cavaquinho, Zé da Velha... and here I am, with all my hair — lots of it, playing the mandolin... Look at Zé da Velha taking a swig of beer! After drinking around ten... he used to play a lot! I remember those two doors... The streets used to fill up... This was the place to be... just like you see here! Suvaco de Cobra Really cool! Choro is the Brazilian Jazz. Jazz - someone plays, does a solo, and then goes on improvising. American style. And our style, such as in choro, we also play the first, second, third parts, and when we repeat, we also throw in our improvisation. I mean, it’s something you create as you play. One is always creating on top of something that’s already been done. Zé da Velha does a lot of counterpoint, get it? He’s the king of counterpoint. After Pixinguinha... Only Zé da Velha can do this sort of counterpoint. And... Zé taught me a lot how to play. One of us writes a melody and the other comes up with another. The resulting dialogue is very interesting. And the brass instruments are very reminiscent of the big bands. Mauricio Carrilho hit the nail on the head when he defined both of us as the smallest big band in the world. This music is ageless. In a choro circle there’s a guy who's 70, another who’s 15, another who's 40... This music is like a communion of sorts. Choro is a communion. Because everyone partakes of this good thing, which is already over a century old. That’s fantastic. No one deserves that. Hi Elisa. Hey, Yamandu! - How’s everything, Marcello? - Doing the nails? - Yeah - Is it your turn? Yes! Are you finished? - Almost, I’ll do you right away. - Come on over! - I brought something to drink... - How are things? - I brought something nice for us... - Great... I know that Yamandu doesn’t touch the stuff. Only his chimarrão (maté). - So how’s the nail... - It’s OK. - Let me see... - See? - See? It’s falling off. OK, let’s fix it. When’s your show? Today I have a rehearsal with Elza for the show in Niteroi. -And Elza really swings, right? You gotta... - Play really intense. - Play really intense. -So let me fix this... So tomorrow you can rehearse and be able to do the show on Tuesday... Chimarrão? Beautiful woman, Don't be that way. Look at her Tenderness Isn’t a bad thing A woman who denies Doesn’t know There's something missing in her heart Ah! Beautiful woman Don’t be that way Tenderness Isn’t a bad thing A woman who denies Doesn’t know There's something missing in her heart We are born, we grow up We want to love A woman who denies Denies what is undeniable We take, we give We want to die No-one gets anything worthwhile without suffering Beautiful woman Beautiful woman Don’t be that way Tenderness Isn’t a bad thing A woman who denies Doesn’t know There's something missing in her heart We are born, we grow up We want to love A woman who denies Denies what is undeniable We take, we give We want to die No-one gets anything without suffering We are born, we grow up We want to love A woman who denies Denies what is undeniable We take, we give We want to die No-one gets anything worthwhile without suffering Ah! No-one gets anything worthwhile without suffering No-one gets anything worthwhile without suffering Beautiful woman... My bad... 10,11,12, 13,14,15,16... - And the neck... - Neck too? 19 and... Fireworks Joe God of children In the distant town Of three hearts On festive days He did cartwheels Fired rockets Released balloons Fireworks Joe Liked Rosa A more handsome Indian girl The world has never seen But the worst thing is That Zé Boticario Liked Rosa Quite a lot too. I can’t say if I’m considered a choro composer, I don’t think so. I’m a popular composer, a song composer, who also writes choros, I have several choros for guitar, I have over 20 choros for guitar, and I’m proud of it. The simplest things are the best... It’s called “Senhorinha”. I wrote it for my two daughters when they were little. I was visiting a farm in Rio de Janeiro state, one Sunday, with my youngest daughter, who was very sick, she wasn’t eating, almost died several times, and that Sunday the girl was bursting with health, eating well, playing, laughing, her cheeks flushed. She was bursting with health that Sunday at the farm. When I got back home, I composed the song, and dedicated it to my two daughters. And I told Paulo Cesar Pinheiro that I had spent Sunday in the country, that’s why it begins: Senhorinha Girl of an old farmhouse Apple of my eye Likes to walk around with a hat, and umbrella As if she had escaped from A nursery rhyme... And so on... Little princess Girl out of a love story Of a fairy tale Likes to play Fairy godmother As who wishes to be My queen If the little girl With her earring and necklace Of aquamarine Likes to spy on me From the neighbouring house As if she wanted me In her alcove Love Will I be going to the altar Will I be in her arms Will this maiden be The muse of this poet Apple of my eye Oh my love... Every Saturday, the boys of the Cordeiro musical band travel four hours to take part in a choro workshop in Rio de Janeiro. Prominent musicians, such as Mauricio Carrilho and Luciana Rabello, convey the tradition of the masters in a spontaneous and unconventional fashion, attracting over 400 youths each week from the city and countryside. Aren’t you a bit late, pal? You brought a whole film set...? My great master was Meira. I’ll never forget it, I was barely a teenager, 14 years old. I arrived at Meira’s house at seven in the morning for my guitar lesson. He gave a traditional guitar lesson until eight. After eight he used to say: “Now we’re going to play!” And at eleven... eleven on the dot he used to say: “Now let’s go out and get a beer...!” And we started drinking, talking, telling stories... He talked about his life playing choro. Hence... such intimacy, such affinity. When he poured me a glass of beer, we partook of an idea... in an act. This is something which marked me forever. It’s speeding up... Lower... D minor with the seventh... And then the G... Better still G major 7, A minor 7... It comes naturally that when you look for a national form of music to develop your talent, you turn to choro. Because it’s a very difficult music, with a high level of virtuosity, it demands lots of discipline, lots of study. It ends up being the school of Brazilian musicians, right? Villa Lobos had already said this, as well as Tom Jobim, Baden Powell, because all of them to a certain extent... Baden came from choro. But all of them to a certain extent learned from choro. Villa Lobos even said that choro is the essence and soul of music in Brazil. So I think it’s very natural that someone who wants to be a Brazilian musician, in a Brazilian way, seeks choro as a school. Choro is older than samba and jazz. We have three distinct influences in choro. The melodic and harmonic structure of European ballroom dancing, the rhythm of African music and the melancholic interpretation of the Brazilian Indian. The relation with samba has always been very natural. Samba is more directly linked to black communities, to religious rites. But many of these musicians were choro musicians. In Pixinguinha’s house, for instance, there was the house of the saints, candomblé in the back yard, where samba reigned, and choro was played in the main room. But the musicians moved around. Pixinguinha, Donga, they moved around all these divisions. A C#... E. Do it slowly... A family of musicians... spontaneous musicians, Full of life, of talent... My mother, daughter of Italians, my father, Brazilian... Brazilian, Portuguese, Spanish... Very much involved in culture by... through luck, through talent. I was born from this marriage and... and I too came out breathing music. Music does me good, makes me... feel happy, and this marriage... made me crazy about sound, about music, about the way of feeling, about the word which doesn’t exist, about the colour which doesn’t exist. I’m a part of this type of feeling. I mean, that’s what I seek in the music I make. I’m seeking that colour... Seven strings is an orchestra, it’s an orchestrated guitar, an intelligent guitar, a guitar which intends to be intelligent. It’s a guitar which doesn’t play blindly, which doesn’t offer security, which doesn’t... No! It’s an instrument which proposes ideas. -This is going to be something also. It’s C. -It’s C... - E flat major. - E flat major. - It’s E flat major 7. - E flat major sharp 5. Can you hear me Zezé? No, I can’t hear, to me harmony doesn’t exist. I can’t hear a thing. It’s all... all scattered. - It lacks weight. - It’s E flat major with 7, right? It lacks weight, and I can’t find myself either. - But that’s what rehearsal is all about. - No, exactly for... Rehearsals are for criticizing... Complaining about the musicians. That mandolin... - It’s fading. - Indeed. As you said... Could it be an octave higher? - What? That change? - Yes... Yes... No, no, no way! Don’t even think about it! The tone already isn’t worth a damn... The string is too tight here. - You should play that part gently... - There’s no going back... That’s what’s spreading the harmony. - Is that what you want? - I don’t think so... When you get the sound, you do it this way. But you alone is one thing, now when you’re playing with a bunch of people, you can’t hear yourself... Choro’s influence can be detected in the work of great geniuses of Brazilian music often not linked to choro, as is the case of Tom Jobim, the giant of Bossa Nova, who, along with Pixinguinha, is one of Brazil’s greatest songwriters. When you pass by So lovely On that sun bathed street My soul gets so tormented That I even forget about football Come quickly Come without fear It was for you, my heart That I kept this secret Hidden in a choro song At the very bottom of my heart... At the very bottom of my heart... Pay attention to what I’m going to say. It’s not you, the singer, who chooses the song. No, it’s the song that chooses you. Do you know why I say that? Because sometimes I adore a song I’m hearing. But if I sing it, with my voice it turns out awful. The same thing happens to me. I mean to say, it’s not my song, it didn’t choose me. I sang when I was 4 years old, the first song I learned was a choro. Yes. This is very interesting. - But... It had to be! - At the age of 4. I sang, getting the words mixed up. “Which hurts me” instead I said “Which burns me, Which burns my heart”. And then time passed, I grew up, got married, came to live in Rio de Janeiro and the situation got rather tough. I thought that by getting married I wouldn’t work any more. I would take care of my daughter, of the house... But things didn’t turn out that way. I suffered, but I felt the need to seek the milieu I liked. And of course... I had it hidden in me, after arriving here... If I managed, OK, if I didn’t, I wasn’t going to struggle to find it. I... I was already on radio, the Radioclube do Brasil, when Benedito Lacerda, I didn’t have a contract or anything, he took me to a place where he was going to play. So I went. And there he soloed “Tico-Tico no Fuba”. I say to him: “I know the lyrics to this song”. He said: “No you don’t, there are no lyrics!” I say: “Yes there are. I’II show you. Go a tone lower”. I lowered the tone and started to sing in his ear. The Tico Tico bird The Tico Tico bird Is eating All, all my cornmeal See Mr. Nicholas The cornmeal is gone I grab my woodpecker gun And the shot goes off Then I feel sorry For the fright he had And I give a full bowl of cornmeal Joyfully flying away Chirping My cornmeal, my cornmeal Jumping from here to there There was a day When he didn’t come back And his tasty cornmeal Flew away in the wind I became sad, I almost cried But then I saw Soon after there was not Only one but two I want to speak quietly About the life of both They made their nest And had little ones They all now jump here And there Always eating the cornmeal Jumping here and there The Tico Tico bird The Tico Tico bird Is eating All, all my cornmeal See Mr. Nicholas The cornmeal is gone I grab my woodpecker gun And the shot goes off Then I feel sorry For the fright he had And I give a full bowl of cornmeal Joyfully flying away Chirping My cornmeal, my cornmeal Jumping from here to there When I recorded Tico Tico no Fuba... And it was a tremendous hit, then they tried to start writing new lyrics for choro music. Because the choro... was just instrumental. Then it became a song. I have a foot corn Which is like a person When cold weather comes It makes the weather warmer But this foot corn Can almost speak It even guesses When the weather will change They already taught me How to cut it out To put tomato on it And hot peppers Be patient Dona Margarida I’m not food To be seasoned I have a foot corn Which is like a person When cold weather comes It makes the weather warmer But this foot corn Can almost speak It even guesses When the weather will change They already taught me How to cut it out To put tomato on it And hot peppers Be patient Dona Margarida I’m not food To be seasoned Ah, don’t step on my corn The more I speak The more you step on me Because of this corn I’m warning you I’ll end up ripping your shirt Now stop fooling around and uttering nonsense Don’t rip my shirt It’s the only one I have Whoever suffers from corns Doesn’t aim for the moon Leaves his feet at home Before hitting the street I have a foot corn Which is like a person When cold weather comes It makes the weather warmer But this foot corn Can almost speak It even guesses When the weather will change They already taught me How to cut it out To put tomato on it And hot peppers Be patient Dona Margarida I’m not food To be seasoned I’m not food To be seasoned I’m not food To be seasoned... I have some samba-choros that I sing. By Ciro de Souza, Pedro Caetano, Wilson Batista. Ciro de Souza has a funny one because... Sambas are generally very chauvinist. It’s always men saying that women are slutty, that they’re no good, that... There’s a truly great one called “The Orgy Husband”. You mustn’t treat me this way I’m not used to this I think it’s bad You only arrive At home late in the morning And if by chance I haven’t woken up yet You get furious And want to beat me I’ve already consulted I’ve already consulted my lawyer And he said The case is complicated An orgy husband Doesn’t have the right To hit a woman Who respects herself You’ve already abused Your authority And I have to put up With such mistreatment... Ciro de Souza... My father had a band... Amateur, it was an amateur band. We played at home. And I played the pandeiro, at six years old I played the pandeiro in his band. And my home was much frequented by musicians, such as Benedito Lacerda, Pixinguinha, Dante Santoro. Because Dino 7 Cordas, my brother, was a member of Benedito Lacerda’s band. And I was already 14, when a musician called us at home to invite my brother Lino, who was... Excuse me... Who was my eldest brother... And he... the guy asked Lino to go do a program on Radio Tamoio on the following day, this was a Saturday... He wanted Lino to bring along a pandeiro player. So Lino said: “Look I can’t... contact anybody now to...” In those days it was difficult to do things by phone. “But I have my brother here, he’s a little young but... he can come with us.” So Ademar said: “All right then, at a pinch...” “...you bring him along today. But next Sunday you take a professional pandeiro player”. So I went... and they kept me. When I saw you playing on television... With Clementina de Jesus, twenty odd years ago... - It was in 73.. - I was very impressed. I remember that... I grew up playing batucada in the streets of Copacabana. And the pandeiro was my last instrument. And seeing you play, it dawned on me: “Wow, this sound sums it all up!” - It’s the beat, right? Yes, it was. It’s like this... Correct me if I’m wrong. That’s it! And I followed in his steps, right? I was lucky to have it all at home. I come from a generation which has already absorbed all the information from you and your records. I processed everything with the pop music, - which is what I normally play. - Which has also gone through major changes. Which made me invert the pandeiro beat. Do you understand? Instead of starting here... -I start here... - It’s complicated for us... But then I threw in Afro-Brazilian music. In a project with Paulo Moura, when I saw the real logic of the Candomblé drums, and that the bass is the soloist. So then I thought: “Well, the best bass is done with the thumb”. If I remove my thumb from the beat, - I put it exactly... -You get the thumb free. Within Afro logic, right? So I began to think: The first thing is to remove it from the first and the second, right? Like this... And the bass... using the technique which comes from your school, - which is the bass with this finger. - But in the regional band, - as it only has the pandeiro... - The pandeiro... The bass is practically limited to the pandeiro. The pandeiro has to do the part of the rhythm section. So the pandeiro holds it all together, it has to beat the strong tempo. -Strong. - Like this then. - Then one...and two..., one... - And then two... ...so the others can have a reference. Thinking over the Afro thing. Let’s go back to Pixinguinha. The question of Pixinguinha is that... He really was a landmark in the rhythm of choro and samba. Because he... When you hear his band Os Oito Batutas... I’m me And the other I don’t know who he is Sing as I... Go on! I’m me And the other I don’t know who he is I’m me And the other I don’t know who he is The pandeiro at the time... You are always angry, in a bad mood, I arrive tired at home And I can’t sleep You just can’t stop talking, A new issue everyday And you don’t explain why What a low point, my God I can’t stand this life anymore This is no life I sought heaven And it was in hell That I ended up... The sound of the tramway! Throw in that beat here... Yes! Yes! Improvisation is done by those who can improvise. Improvisation is not an obligatory part of choro. But this variation which is generally done around the melody, or the counterpoint, or something similar. It’s a very common thing. I think that it’s something... improvisation in choro. .. It’s very different from the concept applied in American music. Improvisation is not provoked. As in: “Now you’re free to go ahead!” “Ok!” Improvisation, sometimes, is a variation. A subtle variation, and you return to the theme, in the middle, right? I mean, improvisation on the theme and both become mixed, right? I spend all day here. My routine... I do it everyday in here... I sit here. Well this clarinet here, like all of them, is always divided in little pieces... I stick a piece here, join another piece there... This clarinet is made of acrylic. I found the acrylic clarinet, the first I had, in a shop window, lost, the poor thing, abandoned. Nobody wanted to play it. So I thought: “Well, as it’s all alone, from now on it will share my life and start its career with me.” Ever since I’ve been playing an acrylic clarinet. And I have a very intimate relationship with the reed, because it doesn’t work very well if I don’t treat it with loving care. Such loving care has to begin with a little lick, like this. And another... sometimes she can prove very demanding. After this, it’s rare that... she’ll let me down. I have to put it in the right place, to get that rasping sound that I like. Not yet. Let’s go! I wanted to be a saxophone player... but I ended up a clarinet player... I mean, at least in my opinion. There’s many people who think I’m neither. Neither saxophone nor clarinet player. I say that because... often I’m playing the clarinet and somebody comes and says: “Your clarinet sounds like a saxophone”. Or when I’m playing the saxophone somebody says: “You sound like a clarinet”. On the same day sometimes I played in the symphonic orchestra, played in a big band and I had to play jazz, and at night I went to play for a dance, and there I had to play popular tunes and resort to that irresponsible way of making music. Which is the type of music for gafieira joints... Mixing everything together. Choro, samba and other rhythms all in the manner, or rather style, prevailing here in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. What I would like to do, and I think it’s the right moment. It’s doing... choro, samba, or this mixture because I don’t know if I play only choro or if I play samba. Quite a jazzified choro, which by the way, is the type of choro that I like, because it’s more extroverted and also... it favours solos. I like to play while seeing the dancer’s reaction. I think that, when I do this, when I communicate with one dancer only, I’m communicating with all... And the dancer instigates me, gives me creative ideas in terms of rhythm. Because Brazilian rhythm is highly distinctive. Our rhythm involves more the central part of the body. Involves the hips more than other rhythms. So to try and involve this part is what’s good... Here is João de Moraes Martins, who’s the founder of the band Pena de Ouro. He founded the band in... 1850 or 1860. And the people who played in the band were slaves because... The family bought slaves in Africa and when they arrived here, instead of hard labor, living in slave quarters they became integrated into the family, became part of it. Then they started to learn music and everything. And one of the descendants of these people who came from Africa — the slaves — is Nem... Rodrigo, who plays with us, plays with us until today. So it’s something which passed in this manner from generation to generation. Brazil has a long and rich tradition of hinterland musical bands. Bands such as Cordeiro’s have had a fundamental role in the education of young musicians to this day. Today musicians, especially trombone players, want to attain that special level of virtuosity... But not Zé da Velha, he's got a lot of that bossa thing... He has a heart like no other musician has. Many musicians think it’s just a question of virtuosity, of reaching perfection. Zé has something of a heart and something of the necessary technique. So my ambition is to follow in his steps because he’s my idol... Zé da Velha. I’m going to call two little guys whose company gives me so much pleasure. Two boys from Cordeiro. One’s called Everson and the other Aquiles. They’re ours... our future duo. And I’m Zé da Velha (old Zé) and this is Silverio Pontes. And these other two are: Zé da Nova (new Zé)— on the trombone and Silvério Pinguelinha (little penguin)—trumpet. Please... The secret of choro’s vitality lies in passion. A passion which unites people from different regions and social classes to extol a music which is historical and at the same time open to new influences. This year the Barca do Choro (Choro ferry) brought some of these aficionados to the Niteroi Municipal Theatre on National Choro Day — April 23 — the birthday of composer Pixinguinha, the ultimate icon of this passion. I want to see... My heart I don’t know why Beats happily When it sees you And my eyes smile And along the streets I follow you But nonetheless You flee from me My heart I don’t know why Beats happily When it sees you And my eyes smile And along the streets I follow you But nonetheless You flee from me Ah, if only you knew How tender I am So tender, so tender How I love you And how my love is sincere I know that you would no longer flee from me Come, come, come, come, Come and feel the warmth Of my lips Seeking yours Come and satisfy this passion Which devours my heart And then only in this way I will be happy So happy Thank you Shanty hut Hanging on the hillside Asking for my help The city at your feet Shanty hut I listen to your voice I don’t forget you for a minute Because I know who you are Tin hut Tradition of my land Tin hut So poor Miserable Shanty hut Hanging on the hillside Asking for my help The city at your feet Shanty hut I listen to your voice I don’t forget you for a minute Because I know who you are Tin hut Tin hut Tin hut
