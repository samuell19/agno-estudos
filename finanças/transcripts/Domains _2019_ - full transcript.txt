I need your signature later. If you have any objections, I'll fix it. "Aki Takemoto, born on September 23rd, 1987 "The subject who is suspected of murder testified on November 6th, 2016" "after being told that she needed not to speak against herself." "Here states her testimony made by her own will during police inquiries..." Excuse me... Any objections? No. What is it? What are we doing? We're confirming your testimony. What for? To make sure there's no mistake. Why? Because it'll be evidence in court. Evidence...? Yes, for your case. My case? Yes. You've been arrested, and been questioned. Now you'll be brought to justice. Brought to justice? After this? That's right. But... Yes? I've already been brought to justice. Did someone do something to you? That's not what I meant. Is it a religious thing? No. Is it figurative? Figurative? Like you sit in judgement of yourself? That's not it, either. What is it? It's very hard to explain. Can you try? I'll give you... an example. It's like time. Time? Yes... right. Time, huh? Time, huh? Anyway, you'll be brought to justice by law, and this is the procedure. I'll continue. Please listen. Number one. "Around 2:30 PM on October 25th, 2016," "I murdered Honoka Kakiuchi by pushing her into the river from a bridge." "She was a three-year-old daughter of my longtime friend, Nodoka Kakiuchi." "I'll confess what happened." "Number two." "That summer, I suddenly felt reluctant to work" "and so I began to skip some days." "Every day I woke up early and prepared to go to work," "but always found myself still at home the rest of the day." "I hardly went to work from around September," "and then took a leave of absence from the middle of October." "Resting at home didn't make me feel any better," "so I decided to leave Tokyo for a while." "I went back to my parents' home in Ryugasaki." "I don't recall the exact date," "but I took the train home in October after the three-day weekend." "My longtime friend, Nodoka, is married and now lives near my parents." "We've been friends since elementary school and throughout..." "Ibaraki University where we both graduated." "I contacted her through a messaging app upon my arrival," "promising to visit her new house." "Her husband, Naoto, was also a member of..." "our photography club at the university." "We all knew each other well." "I hadn't seen them for about four years since their wedding." "Honoka was born during that time, so I also wanted to meet her." "Number three." "I visited their house on the day I arrived." "They had a nice garden," "and the room temperature and humidity were just right." "So at first, the house looked well-kept and comfortable." "However, later I began to see another side of the family." "Nodoka seemed to feel stifled to maintain the comfort of the house." "Naoto, on the other hand, treasured the home so much that..." "he seemed to be keeping everyone out except his family." "I could see the couple had many disagreements." "Especially, Nodoka looked more exhausted than the last time I saw her." "It was painful to see my longtime friend so worn out." "I noticed they often disagreed about their daughter, Honoka." "One day, while Nodoka was out shopping or something," "I was looking after Honoka for her." "Then Honoka got too excited while we played and ran a fever." "Naoto rushed home from the middle school where he worked..." "just to check on her." "Then he blamed me for her fever." "Naoto said to me..." "It was obvious that I was on leave for mental illness." "So I had to see a doctor." "Otherwise my illness would affect his family," "which may cause another problem." "That's what he said." "It was the day the approaching typhoon finally struck the Kanto region," "and the train to Tokyo was out of service since that morning." "I was ready to go back but forced to stay." "So I had no choice but to wait for the typhoon to pass." "And then..." "Nodoka called me on my cell phone a little after lunch time." "Then she said she urgently had to go out," "and asked me if I could look after Honoka while she was away." "Nodoka was already dressed and left the house soon after I got there." "She didn't explain to me what had come up." "I didn't ask her, either." "She just said she'd be back within an hour." "Honoka was restless, excited by the typhoon's howling winds." "I was careful not to stir her up" "and tried to keep her mind off the storm outside." "I taught her how to make origami." "Just as I thought, that really amused her." "I felt relieved for a while," "but things changed as the typhoon's eye brought clear skies between the clouds." "Honoka became eager to go outside and play." "We went out and watched the swollen river from the blue bridge." "The water level fell since the last time I saw it," "but the usual gentle flow had turned into a raging muddy stream." "Honoka also noticed the difference and was mesmerized." "She was standing still while grabbing my arm with her little hand" "and was watching the river." "Eventually dark clouds hid the clear sky, and it started to rain." "I sensed low air pressure returning after the typhoon's eye passed," "so I tried to go home." "She refused." "She remained by the railing and didn't move." "Meanwhile, the rain got heavier, and the wind started to pick up." "I tried to lift her up in my arms and return home by force," "but Honoka began screaming, thrusting my arms aside." "She was much stronger than I imagined." "I was shocked and began to fear her." "Then suddenly I felt..." "it was alright to push Honoka off the bridge." "I only remember that the idea popped in my head out of nowhere." "As I felt the urge to murder her," "I shoved Honoka into the river." "I can't begin to express what I feel for her mother, Nodoka." "Of course I regret it, but it's only a small part of what I feel." "There are all sorts of emotions packed behind it." "As I said before, I have fully spoken my mind in my letter to her." "However, whoever reads it won't understand what is written" "except us." Any objections? Then please sign here. Can I ask about the letter? What about? What's "the kingdom made with chairs and sheets on the day of the typhoon?" I can't explain. What happened on the day of the typhoon? Nothing really. Nothing at all? It was just... a very fulfilling day for us. What does that mean? At a towering castle in springtime, A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers. Cups of wine are passed around Under shadows cast by trees on clear night. I see the moon is arising and dancing Through each branch of the pine trees. Dating back to a thousand years they've grown, Where ever have the glorious old days gone? Let's read through scene one and two. "Scene 1: Muddy stream." "A river rushes ferociously." "Murky water constantly collided, foamed, and disappeared." "The river rises as the flow gains momentum," "washing away the riverbank." "Sounds of blustering winds and pouring rain." "Scene 2: Takemoto's living room, late summer, 22 years ago." "Outside the window, leaves are whirling in the wind." "The sound of heavy rain." "Blown by the wind, 3 leaf sticks to the window." "Children are bubbling with laughter inside the house." "They're making a small white castle in the living room." "They've thrown some bed sheets over the chairs" "and stretched them across like a fort." "Aki and Nodoka are inside the small castle." "The two push the chairs outwards, keeping the tension of the sheets" "to make more rooms." "The castle is finished." "Yes, our castle." "They sit inside and look around the room." "A faint light filters through the white sheets." "Hey, let's think of a password." "A password?" "Yes, a secret word." "Something only we know." "Why?" "If we don't have one, anyone can come in." "We can just show our faces." "What if we can't?" "We can tell from our voices." "Aki considers it for a while." "We need a password to hear the voice." "Nodoka considers it for a while." "I see." "Nodoka nods." "Deal?" "Well, I want a song, not a word." "A song?" "A song." "What kind of a song?" "Nodoka gives it a thought." "The one you were singing like this..." "At a towering castle in springtime..." "That's the one." "At a towering castle in springtime," "A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers." "Aki and Nodoka look at each other." "At a towering castle in springtime," "A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers." "Deal?" "Aki and Nodoka nod to one another." Hey, let's think of a password. A password? Yeah, a secret word only we know. Why? Because". If we don't have one, anyone can come in. We can just show our faces. What if we can't? We can tell from our voices. We need a password to hear the voice. I see. Deal? Well, I want a song, not a word. A song? A song. It's sunny outside. Really? We're in the eye. Hey... let's go outside and play. No, we can't. Why? It's dangerous. No, it's not. We're not supposed to go out during a typhoon. It's gone. No, it's not. But it's sunny out. We're in its eye. Its eye? Yes. "A storm dies down when you're in the eye of the typhoon," "but soon it would be stormy again." What was that about? I read it in a book. Is it true? It's true. Don't be fooled. It's quiet only for a moment. A bad storm will come back soon. "What is it?" "A castle?" "Is that a castle?" "She says it's a castle." "Huh?" "What kind of castle do you think she's imagining?" "I don't know... maybe like Cinderella's castle?" "Did you go to Disneyland?" "Yes, we did this year and maybe we'll go next year, too." "Children love castles." "Yeah, they do." "We made a castle, too." "I'm sure we're thinking the same thing right now." "At a towering castle in springtime," "That's the one." "A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers." "We became really close ever since that day." "Is that so?" "You had closer friends before, Nodoka." "Did I?" "You hung out with Maya and Anna." "Oh, yes, of course." "That day, only you came to my house" "but couldn't go home because of the typhoon." "So I stayed over, right?" "No, you only stayed for a few hours." "Really?" "Yeah, your parents picked you up in the evening." "Are you sure?" "I remember you went home." "I thought the time we spent together was much longer." "That day was really weird, right?" "Yes, it felt strange." What is it? A castle? Is that a castle? She says it's a castle. Huh? I wonder what kind of castle she's imagining. I don't know... maybe Cinderella's castle? Did you go to Disneyland? Yes, we did this year. Maybe next year, too. Children love castles. Sure. We made a castle, too. I know what you're thinking. At a towering castle in springtime... Yeah, that's it. A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers. We became really close since that day. Is that so? You had closer friends before. Did I? Like Maya and Anna. Oh, yes... of course. That day, only you came in spite of the typhoon. So I stayed over, right? No, you only stayed for a few hours. Oh, really? Yeah, your parents picked you up in the evening. Are you sure? I remember you went home. I thought I was there much longer. That day was weird, wasn't it? Yes, it was strange. I think about it sometimes. About what? How really, truly significant moments come along suddenly without warning. It's like... as if I'm in a fairytale. Mmhm. I don't really know how meaningful it is at that very moment. I would know only later. I just can't predict when it comes and how meaningful, but these moments would surely affect the rest of my life. I don't know, but sounds a little scary. Yeah, it is, but we wouldn't be so close now if it wasn't for that moment. You're thinking too much. Yeah, I probably am. What's wrong? Can you watch Honoka for a while? Huh? Sure. Going shopping? I have something to do. "Children are sensitive." "Yes." "They can get a fever from getting too excited, huh?" "Because children have unrestrained emotion." "Unrestrained?" "Honoka's lived only for three years." "Right, so she's still learning how to control her emotion." "Exactly." "Small things for adults are amplified on children." "They are like loudspeakers, huh?" "So I have to know what affects her and how." "You're extremely cautious." "Yes, I have to be." "I see." "Hey... "What?" "Do you also worry about room temperature and humidity?" "Sure, I do." "I thought so." "Why?" "I noticed it when I first came over to visit." "Oh." "Is your house always like that?" "Yeah, since we built it." "Did she agree?" "Yes." "A home can easily collapse if you're not careful." "Collapse?" "It would be a bunch of people just staying together." "Staying together?" "Yes." "Like people just sharing a house. Do you know what I mean?" "I guess so." "A lot of families are like that, but we don't want it to happen to us." "Does Nodoka agree?" "Sure, that's why she is with me." "Yes... of course." "You think it's stifling, don't you?" "Honestly, I do. It's nerve-wracking." "I don't blame you," "but what matters is timing." "Timing?" "Like I said, Honoka is at a delicate age, so I can't take risks." "You'd never be able to relax that way." "Maybe so," "but things could change after she starts kindergarten next year." "I don't want to treat you like you're my student." "But even if you needed a break, that's not acceptable." "I'm sorry." "You promised to quit until Honoka got older." "I did." "I know I'm making a big deal out of something small." "Yes." "I think you should stop hanging out with Aki though." "Why?" "I see nothing positive in her now." "The rumor about her bothers you?" "It does." "Maybe she has reasons she can't tell." "Murderers have reasons they can't tell, too." "You're going too far." "Right, I'm sorry." "Okay." "Aki is too nosy though." "She's just concerned." "Is her concern doing us any good?" "Any good?" "Yes, for our family." "Hi." "Sorry about the other day." "Don't be." "Why are you dressed like that?" "I need to run some errands." "I see." "Is Honoka better?" "Oh, she's up and running around." "Good, where is she?" "She's with my parents." "Come in." "No, my parents are expecting me." "Okay." "Here." "What is it?" "A wool cap I knitted." "Thanks. Can I open it?" "Sure." "Nice... I like it." "Thank you." "I'm glad you're still here." "What do you mean?" "Aki is too nosy though." "She's just concerned." "Is her concern doing us any good?" "Any good?" "Yes, for our family." "That's really mean. She just cares about us." "No, you need to be more cautious with her." "Why not?" "I think her unnecessary concerns are making us restless." "Really?" "Yeah." "You two are picking up Aki's negative vibes." "You're blaming her?" "Honoka got a fever, didn't she?" "Well..." "Be careful." "Her influence is going to spread." "I think..." "What?" "You're using the logic of a teacher in our home." "No, I'm not." "I'm just worried, very worried." "Maybe," "but things can change after she starts kindergarten next year." "Can you really live like that?" "I'm sure this family can." "Don't lock them up in the house with that logic of yours." "I'm joking." "Are you?" "But please listen to what Nodoka has to say." "I do." "You also have to tell her what you think, like you just did." "Hey... "Aren't you being a bit too intrusive?" "Sorry, I said too much." "Besides, you're the one who needs to explain things." "What do you mean?" "I know you took leave from work." "Who told you?" "People are saying that you abandoned your job and vanished." "Do you believe that?" "Not everything," "but there's no smoke without fire." "Excuse me?" "If it isn't true then why hide it?" "You could at least tell Nodoka." "Why does it matter?" "So she doesn't feel deceived." "Don't impose..." "your assumptions on me for your own peace of mind." "Well, I do want peace of mind." "I have to keep our family safe." "Thank you." "I'm glad you're still here." "What do you mean?" "I heard you and Naoto had a quarrel." "Right." "We did." "Naoto and I talked about it," "and he thinks we need some space from you." "What?" "Because Naoto is very sensitive now," "and we don't want Honoka to get excited." "SO?" "So I'm sorry, but we have to ask you not to visit us for a while." "You think it's my fault?" "I'm so sorry for what's happening." "Is that really what you think?" "The four are having dinner." "Honoka is eating meatball soup." "The adults are eating cabbage rolls and drinking wine." "Jonan Middle School?" "You're teaching there?" "Yes, since this April." "You are an art teacher in Jonan..." "What?" "Don't you know?" "How there used to be school violence?" "So you knew." "Nodoka reacted just like you." "Of course, right?" "Well, he says things are different now." "No... I don't think so." "Honoka utters 'Jonan, Jonan', then spills the soup." "Nodoka cleans the mess." "Naoto speaks, looking at them." "You probably stereotyped Jonan kids because they looked a bit intimidating." "Well, I guess so." "See?" "We went to an all-girls school, so..." "No, that doesn't matter." "Do you disagree?" "Jonan kids were so violent." "They broke all the windows in school." "Right, I remember..." "We went there together." "It was so cold..." "What's that about?" "Our former classmate went to Jonan and joined their school band." "It was Macky." "Right, her real nickname was Macky the Glockenspiel Player." "Are you sure?" "Huh?" "Wasn't she called Macky the Glocken?" "NO." "Well, maybe you're right." "Hey, wait..." "Macky the Glockenspiel Player' sounds familiar, too" "Um, which is correct?" You probably stereotyped Jonan kids because they looked intimidating. I guess so. See? We went to an all-girls school, so... No, that doesn't matter. You disagree? The kids were so violent that they broke all the windows. Yes, I remember. We went there together. On a cold day. Oh, yeah? A girl we knew went to Jonan and joined their school band. Macky. Yes, Macky the Glockenspiel Player. Really? Huh? Wasn't it just Macky the Glocken? Well, maybe so. But "Macky the Glockenspiel Player" also sounds familiar. Um, which is it? Let me see... Whichever it was, go on. Where was I? You said Macky joined the band. That's right. And...? The annual concert. Right. She invited us to her school for a concert. It was a totally different world. There were no windows. Oh... What used to be windows were all covered with cardboard. It was so dark even in daytime. There were holes and gaps in the cardboard, too. So the winds battered against them. We couldn't hear the band. The graffiti was awful. All over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either. Ready? Action! Jonan Middle School? You're teaching there? Yeah, since this April. Wow, an art teacher in Jonan, huh? What? Don't you know? How there used to be school violence? So you knew. Nodoka reacted just like you. Of course, right? He says it's different now. Nah, I don't think so. You probably stereotyped Jonan kids because they looked intimidating. Yeah, kind of. See? We went to an all-girls school, so... No, that doesn't matter. You disagree? It was so terrible that the kids broke all the windows in the gym. Yes, I remember. We went there together. On a cold day. Oh, yeah? A girl we knew went to Jonan and joined their school band. Macky. Yeah, Macky the Glockenspiel Player. Really? Wasn't it Macky the Glocken? I'm not sure... Wait, "Macky the Glockenspiel Player" sounds familiar, too. Which is it? Let me see... Whichever it was, go on. How far did I tell you? It was about Macky's band. That's right. And...? The band's annual concert. Yeah, Macky the Glockenspiel Player. Really? Wasn't it Macky the Glocken? Maybe she was. Wait, "Macky the Glockenspiel Player" sounds familiar, too. Which was it really? I'll get this, wait... Whichever it was, go on. How far did I tell you? You said Macky joined the band. Right. And then what? The annual concert. Right. She invited us to her school for a concert. It was a totally different world. There were no windows in the gym. What used to be windows were all covered with cardboard. And it was so dark even in daytime. There were holes and gaps in the cardboard, too. So the cold winds battered against them. We couldn't hear the band. The graffiti was awful, too. Yes, all over the walls. Then what? About the annual concert. Right, we went to her band's concert at the school. It felt like another world. All the windows in the gym were broken. What used to be windows were all covered with cardboard. It was so dark even in daytime. There were holes and gaps in the cardboard, too. So the cold winds battered against them. We couldn't hear the band. The graffiti was awful, right? Yes, all over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either. About the annual concert. Oh, yeah. She invited us to her school for a concert. It was a totally different world. There were no windows in the gym. What used to be windows were all covered with cardboard. It was so dark even in daytime. There were holes in the cardboard, too. So the cold winds battered against them. We couldn't hear the band. The graffiti was awful... Right, all over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either. But they still have bullies and truants. Yeah, more or less. See, I'm not talking about any specific class. Right. So I first thought Naoto was teaching graffiti there. I could see you teaching it with a straight face. Yeah? About the annual concert. Right, we went to her band's concert at the school. It was like a different world. All the windows in the gym were broken. What used to be windows were all covered with cardboard. So the cold winds battered against them. We couldn't hear the band. The graffiti was awful, too. All over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either. But they still have bullies and truants. Yeah, more or less. You see, I'm not talking about any specific class. Right. So... I first thought Naoto was teaching graffiti there. I could see you teaching it with a straight face. Yeah? I agree. Really? You see logic in everything. I do? - How about you, Aki? - Cut! Clapboard. Scene 13-1, take 10. Hey, wait a minute. What's wrong? Aren't we going to the fabric store? Mmhm. Is this the right way? The one we used to go to is closed. I see. We're going to a mall. Oh, the new mall. We do most of our shopping there now. How far is it from here? About 30 minutes' drive. That's far. Is it? It's like going to Mitaka from Shinjuku. I don't quite get it. Sorry. Sense of distance is different here. We should just go to Tokyo instead. Huh? It's only an hour away by expressway. Sure, but... Let's go, and I'll buy Honoka a dress. No, you won't. Let me. Hey, wait a minute. What's wrong? Aren't we going to the fabric store? Mmhm. Is this the right way? The one we used to go to is closed. I see. We're going to a mall. Oh, the new mall. We do most of our shopping there now. How far is it? About 30 minutes' drive. That's far. Not really... It's like going to Mitaka from Shinjuku. I don't quite get it. Sorry. Sense of distance is different here. We should just go to Tokyo instead. Huh? It's only an hour away by expressway. Sure, but... Let's go, and I'll buy Honoka a dress. No, you won't. I will, so let's go. Thank you, but she'll grow out of it quickly. I want to give her a gift. Right, Honoka? Look at her. We'll eat some good food, too. We can get clothes here. No, you deserve a break. Hey, wait a minute. What's wrong? Aren't we going to the fabric store? Mmhm. Is this the right way? The one we used to go to is closed. I see. We're going to a mall. Right, the new mall. We do most of our shopping there now. How far is it? About 30 minutes' drive. That's far. Not really... It's like going to Mitaka from Shinjuku. I don't quite get it. Sorry. Sense of distance is different here. Hey... We should go to Tokyo instead. Huh? It's an hour away by expressway, so let's go. Sure, but... Let's go, and I'll buy Honoka a dress. No, you won't. Let me. Thank you, but she'll grow out of it quickly. I wanna buy her a gift. Right, Honoka? Look at her. We'll eat some good food, too. We can get clothes here. No, you deserve a break. I'm sorry. Aki, you were there just by chance. But... It's not your fault. Are you angry? I'm not angry, so please just stop. But... She's good, right? A bit excited, wasn't she? Yeah, just a fever. You're right. Calm down. I am calm. You don't seem to be. I'm sorry. We'll talk later. Yes. I'll walk you home. No, let me help. Thanks, but it's a family matter. I'll see you. Yeah. She's good, right? A bit excited, wasn't she? Yeah, just a fever. You're right. Calm down. I am calm. You don't seem to be. Sorry. Let's talk later. Alright. I'll walk you home. No, let me help. Thanks, but it's a family matter. I'll see you. Yeah. Children are sensitive. Yeah. They can get a fever from getting too excited, huh? Because children have unrestrained emotion. Unrestrained? Honoka's lived only for three years. I see. She's still learning how to control her emotion. Exactly. Small things for adults are amplified on children. So they're like loudspeakers, huh? So I have to know what affects her and how. You're extremely cautious. Yeah, I've got to be. Hey... What? Do you also worry about room temperature and humidity? Sure, I do. I see. Why? I noticed it when I first came over to visit. Oh. Is your house always like that? Yeah, since we built it. Did she agree? Yeah. A home can easily collapse, if you're not careful. Collapse? It would be a bunch of people just staying together. Staying together? Like... people just sharing a house. Do you know what I mean? I guess so. A lot of families are like that. We don't want to be one of them. Does Nodoka agree? Sure. That's why she's with me. Yeah... of course. You think it's stifling, don't you? Honestly, I do. It's nerve-wracking. I don't blame you, but what matters is timing. Timing? Like I said, Honoka is at a delicate age, so I can't take risks. You'd never be able to relax that way. Maybe so, but things could change after she starts kindergarten next year. Can you really live like that? I'm sure this family can. Don't lock them up in the house with that logic of yours. I'm joking. Ah-huh. But please listen to what Nodoka has to say. I do. You also have to tell her what you think, like you just did. Aren't you being a bit too intrusive? Sorry, I said too much. You're the one who needs to explain things. What do you mean? I know you took leave from work. Who told you? People are saying that you abandoned your job and vanished. Do you believe that? Not everything, but there's no smoke without fire. Excuse me? If it isn't true then why hide it? You could at least tell Nodoka. Why does it matter? So she doesn't feel deceived. Don't impose your assumptions on me just to feel safe. I do want to feel safe. I've got to protect our family. Huh? So you think... I'm some kind of virus, don't you? No. Then what? I'm sorry. Aki, you were there just by chance. But... It's not your fault. Are you angry? I'm not angry, so will you stop? But... She's good, right? A bit excited, wasn't she? Yeah, just a fever. You're right. - Calm down. - I'm calm. You don't seem to be. I'm sorry. We'll talk later. Yes. I'll take you home. No, let me help. Thanks, but it's a family matter. I'll see you. Yeah. I'm sorry. Aki, you just happened to be there. But... It's not your fault. Are you angry? I'm not angry, so will you stop? But... She's good, right? A bit too excited, wasn't she? Yeah, just a fever. You're right. - Calm down. - I'm calm. You don't seem to be. I'm sorry. Let's talk later. Alright. - I'll take you home. - No, let me help. Thanks, but it's a family matter. I'll see you. Yeah. I don't wanna treat you like you're my student. But even if you needed a break, that's not acceptable. I'm sorry. You promised to quit until Honoka got older. I did. I know I'm making a big deal out of something small. Yes. I think you should stop hanging out with Aki. Why? I see nothing positive in her now. The rumor about her bothers you? It does. Maybe she has reasons she can't tell. Murderers have reasons they can't tell, too. You're going too far. Right, I'm sorry. Okay. Aki is too nosy though. She's just concerned. Is her concern doing us any good? Any good? Yeah, for our family. That's really mean. She just cares about us. No, you need to be more cautious with her. You think so...? I think her unnecessary concerns are making us restless. Really? Sure. You two are picking up Aki's negative vibes. You're blaming her? Honoka got a fever, didn't she? Well... Be careful, or her influence is going to spread. I think... What? You're using logic that works only in schools in our home. No, I'm not. I'm just worried. I'm very worried. Alright. I'll tell Aki. I don't want to treat you like you're my student. But even if you needed a break, that's not the right way to do it. Sorry. You promised to quit until Honoka got older. I did. I know I'm making a big deal out of something small. I think you should stop hanging out with Aki. Why? Because I see nothing positive in her now. The rumor about her bothers you? It sure does. Maybe she has reasons she can't tell. Murderers have reasons they can't tell, too. You're going too far. Right, sorry. Yes. Aki's too nosy though. She's just concerned. Is her concern doing us any good? Any good? Yeah, for our family. That's really mean. She just cares about us. No, you need to be more cautious with her. You think so...? I think her unnecessary concerns are making us restless. Really? Sure. You two are picking up Aki's negative vibes. You're blaming her? Honoka got a fever, didn't she? Be careful, or her influence is going to spread. I think... What? You're using logic that works only in schools in our home. Of course not. I'm worried, that's all. I'm very worried though. I understand. I'll speak to Aki myself. Yeah. Hi. Sorry about the other day. Don't be. Why are you dressed like that? I need to run some errands. Oh. Is Honoka better? Oh, she's up and running around. Good. Where is she? She's with my parents. Come in. No, my parents are expecting me. I see. Here. What is it? A wool cap I knitted. Can I open it? Yeah... Thanks, I really like it. I'm glad you're still here. What do you mean? I heard you and Naoto had a quarrel. Right, we did. Naoto and I talked about it. He thinks we need some space from you. What? Because". Naoto is very sensitive now, and we don't want to excite Honoka, either. So? So... I'm sorry, but we have to ask you not to visit us for a while. You think I'm at fault? I'm so sorry for what's happening. You don't really mean it, do you? Sorry. If you need help, just tell me. Are you teaching at the Jonan Middle School? Yeah, since this April. An art teacher in Jonah, huh? What? Don't you know? You mean the school violence? So you knew. Nodoka reacted just like you. Of course, right? He says it's different now. Nah, I don't think so. You just stereotyped Jonan kids because they looked a bit intimidating. Yeah, kind of... See? We went to an all-girls school. No, that doesn't matter. You disagree? The kids were so violent they broke all the windows in school. Yes, I remember. We went there together. On a cold day. What's that about? A girl we knew went to Jonan and joined their school band. Macky. Yes, Macky the Glockenspiel Player. Really? Wasn't she called Macky the Glocken? You may be right. But "Macky the Glockenspiel Player" sounds familiar... Which is it? Let me see... Whichever it was, go on. Where was I? You were talking about Macky's band. Right. And then what? About the concert. That's right. So we went to the band's concert at the school. Wow, it felt like another world because all the windows were broken. Besides, what used to be windows were covered with cardboard. So the cold winds battered against them. We couldn't hear the band. There was graffiti everywhere. All over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either. They still have bullies and truants though. Yeah, more or less. Not that I'm talking about anyone special. Right. So I first thought Naoto was teaching graffiti there. I could see you teaching it with a straight face. Yeah? I agree. Really? You see logic in everything. I do? You're an art teacher in Jonan... What? Don't you know? You mean the school violence? So you knew. Nodoka reacted just like you. Of course, right? He says it's different now. Nah, I don't think so. How bad can it be? Maybe you stereotyped Jonan kids because they just looked intimidating. Yeah, kind of. See? We went to an all-girls school. No, that doesn't matter. You disagree? The kids were so violent they broke all the windows in school. Yes, I remember. We went there together. It was so cold... What's that about? A girl we knew went to Jonan and joined their school band. Macky. Yeah, Macky the Glockenspiel Player. Really? Wasn't it just Macky the Glocken? Maybe right. Wait... "Macky the Glockenspiel Player" also sounds familiar. Which is it? Let me see... Whichever it was, go on. Where was I? You said Macky joined the band. That's right. And...? About the concert. That's right. She invited us to her school for a concert. See, it was a totally different world. There were no windows in the gym. What used to be windows were all covered with cardboard. So the cold winds battered against them. We couldn't hear the band. There were lots of graffiti, too. Yes, all over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either. They still have bullies and truants though. Yeah, more or less. Not that I'm talking about anyone special. Right. So... I first thought Naoto was teaching graffiti there. I could see you teaching it with a straight face. I agree. I think about it sometimes. About what? How really, truly significant moments comes along suddenly without warning. It's like... as if I'm in a fairytale. I don't really know how meaningful it is at that very moment. I would know only later. I just can't predict when it comes and how meaningful. But these moments would surely affect the rest of my life. I don't know, but sounds a little scary. Yeah, it is, but we wouldn't be so close now if it wasn't for that moment. That day, only you came to my house but couldn't go home because of the typhoon. So I stayed over, right? No, you only stayed for a few hours. Really? Yeah, your parents picked you up in the evening. Are you sure? Yeah, I remember you went home. I thought I was there much longer. That day was weird, right? Yes, it was strange. I think about it sometimes. About what? How really, truly significant moments comes along suddenly without warning. Just like I'm in a fairytale... I don't really know how meaningful it is at that very moment. I would know only later. I just can't predict when it comes and how meaningful. But these moments would surely affect the rest of my life. I don't know, but sounds a little scary. Cut! Clapboard. Scene 26-1, take 6. I think about it sometimes. About what? How really, truly significant moments comes along suddenly without warning. Just like I'm in a fairytale... I don't really know how meaningful it is at that very moment. I would know only later. I just can't predict when it comes and how meaningful. But these moments would surely affect the rest of my life. I don't know, but sounds a little scary. Yeah, it is. But we wouldn't be so close now if it wasn't for that moment. You're thinking too much. Yeah, I probably am. Can you watch Honoka for a while? Huh? Sure. Going shopping? I have something to do. A home could easily collapse, if you're not careful. Collapse? It would just be a bunch of people staying together. Staying together? Yeah, like people sharing a house, if you know what I mean... I guess... A lot of families are like that, but we don't want it to happen to us. Nodoka says so, too? Yeah, that's why she's with me. Of course... You think it's stifling, don't you? Yeah, honestly speaking. It's nerve-wrecking. I don't blame you. What matters now is timing. Timing? As I said before, Honoka is at a delicate age. We can't risk anything. That leaves you no time to relax. Yeah, but things could change when she starts kindergarten next year. Can you really live like that? I'm sure this family can. Please don't lock them up to accomplish what you say. I'm just joking. But listen to what Nodoka has to say, too. I listen to her. You also have to talk to her like you did with me. I think you're being too intrusive. Sorry. I said too much. Besides, you're the one who's not really talking. What do you mean? I heard you're taking leave from work. Who told you? Rumor has it you abandoned your work and disappeared. You believe that? Not everything, but there's no smoke without fire. Excuse me? If you didn't do anything wrong, you could've at least told Nodoka. What if I did tell her? We wouldn't have to feel deceived. You're obtrusive. You just want to feel secure. I need to feel secure. I have to keep my family safe. So you think I'm some kind of virus, don't you? No. Then what? If you're stressed out, see a doctor, not your longtime friend. So I'm a virus. Oh, c'mon. You want me locked up. No! But if you need to stay in hospital, you should. You've always been like that. I'm saying it for you. It's for your own good. Hi. Sorry about the other day. Don't be. You look different. I need to run some errands. Is Honoka better? Oh, she's up and around. Good. Where's she now? She's with my parents. I see. You wanna come in? No, my parents are expecting me. Oh, okay. Here. What is it? A wool cap. I knitted it. Can I open it? Thanks, it's really nice. I'm glad you're still here. What do you mean? I heard you and Naoto had a quarrel. Yes, we quarreled. We talked about it. And Naoto thinks we need some space from you. What are you saying? He's very sensitive now and we don't want to excite Honoka, either. And? So... I'm sorry, but I have to ask you not to visit us for a while. Are you saying it's my fault? I'm really sorry for what's happening. You don't really mean it, do you? I'm sorry. If you need help, just tell me. Jonan Middle School? You teach there? Yeah, since this April. So you're an art teacher there. What? Don't you know? You mean the school violence? So you knew. Nodoka reacted just as you did. Oh, I'm sure. The kids seem to be different now. You just stereotyped them because Jonan kids looked intimidating. You may be right. See? We went to an all-girls school, so... No, that doesn't matter. You disagree? The kids were so violent they broke all the windows in school. Yeah, I remember... We were there together. It was cold. What? A girl we knew went to Jonan and joined the school band. It was Macky. Yeah, Macky the Glockenspiel Player. Are you sure? Wasn't it just Macky the Glocken? Maybe it was. But "Macky the Glockenspiel Player" sounds familiar, too. Which was it? Let me see... Whichever it was, go on. How far did I tell you? Macky joined the band. That's right. And...? The band's annual concert. Right. She invited us to her school for a concert. It was a totally different world. There were no windows. What used to be windows were all covered with cardboard. The wind was battering against it. We couldn't hear the band. There were lots of graffiti, too. All over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either. But they still have bullies and truants. More or less... Not that I'm talking about anyone special. I know. So I first thought you're teaching graffiti there. You'd teach it with a straight face. Yeah? I agree. Really? You see logic in everything. I do? How about you, Aki? Are you still with the publisher? Yeah, sort of... I didn't know editors' work was so tough. I was shocked. Why? You have to explain first. Sorry. What is it? My classmate, Matsuura... You probably don't know him. He joined a publisher and told us about what it was to be an editor. I see... Man, it sounded like hell. Did you study editing from manuscripts your superiors threw away? That's what he was saying. Oh... Oops, I did it again. That's alright. I've heard about those things, but not with my publisher. Is that so? Besides I'm not an editor. You're not? I'm on the production side, that is, printing, binding, and the like. Of course, we talk with the editors a lot, but there's no hierarchy like major publishers have. Good. I was a bit worried about you. You'd be fine anywhere. Right, Aki's really tough. You just said you were worried. Yeah... What I meant to say was... I know what you wanted to say. Good. Right. Be careful. See? Oh, sorry. There you go. What? A coded circuit. A coded circuit? Is this what it is? Yeah. What is it? It means you two can talk without words. He says we always talk like that. Actually, you're conveying more without words. Are we? When we were students, I really thought you were using codes. He says our coding rules change. Even the rules are coded, so it's impossible to decipher. But don't you guystalk in a similar way? Do we? You can eliminate words only when you've shared many experiences. Right. So it's only natural for longtime acquaintances. Well, I don't know... We try to use words all the time. Yeah, that's our rule. That sounds painful. Yeah? Words help make things go smoothly. But you can never say, like "Oh, it's nothing." Right? That's forbidden. Isn't it stifling? Not at all. You're being too frank, Aki. She's using words, and that's good. Clank. Are you sleepy, Honoka? Let's take you to bed. "Scene 1: Muddy stream." "Scene 2: Takemoto's living room, late summer, 22 years ago." "The castle is finished." "Yeah, the castle is finished." "Hey, let's think of a password." "A password?" "Yeah, a secret word only the two of us know." "Why?" "If we don't have it, anyone can come in." "We can just show our faces." "What if we can't?" "We can tell from our voices." "We need a password to hear the voice." "Oh, I see." "Deal?" "Well, I want a song, not a word." "A song?" "Yeah, a song." "What kind of a song?" "The one you were singing. It went like this..." "At a towering castle in springtime. "That's the one." "At a towering castle in springtime," "A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers." "At a towering castle in springtime," "A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers." "Deal?" "It's sunny outside." "Really?" "We're in the eye." "Let's go outside and play." "NO." "Why?" "It's dangerous." "No, it's not." "Let's go to the bridge over the river." "We mustn't go out during the typhoon." "It's gone." "No, it's not." "But it's sunny out." "We're in the eye." "The eye?" "'A storm recedes when you're in the eye of a typhoon, "'but soon it would be stormy again. "What's that about?" "It was in a book." "Is it true?" "It's true." "Don't be fooled. It's quiet only for a moment." "A bad storm is coming back soon." "Scene 4: On the train, one month ago in early October." "Scene 5: Platform, terminal station." "Scene 8: Riverbank, early evening." "Scene 9: Bridge, early evening." "Scene 10: Kakiuchi's house, exterior." "Scene 12: Kakiuchi's front door." "Scene 12: Kakiuchi's front door." "It's so good to see you, Aki." "Long time no see." "When was our last meeting?" "I wonder..." "It was four years ago at our wedding." "That's right." "Thanks for inviting me." "The pleasure is ours." "So it's your first time to see Honoka?" "I've only seen her photos." "So it's your first time to see our house, too?" "That's right." "So it's really been a while." "It's Aki. Say hello." "Good evening." "C'mon, don't be shy." "Maybe I scared her." "What's up?" "You're still you, Aki." "Of course, I am. "You're still you, Nodoka." "Hey, don't just stand and chat." "He's right. Come in." "What's the matter?" "Your house feels so comfortable." "Really?" "It is." "It seems like a regular house to me." "Well, that's the best part of it." "Oh..." "This is for you." "Thank you. I had my eye on it." "Scene 17: Bridge." "Sorry I'm late." "You aren't so late." "Do you remember?" "Remember what?" "That we used to meet here?" "I always made you wait." "Was that so?" "I always tried to be on time, but never succeeded." "It never bothered me." "Scene 18: Car on national highway, inside." "Hey, wait a minute." "What's wrong?" "Aren't we going to the fabric store?" "Mmhm." "Is this the right way?" "The one we used to go to is closed." "I see." "We're going to a mall." "Oh, the new mall." "We do most of our shopping there now." "How far is it?" "About 30 minutes' drive." "That's far." "Not really." "It's like going to Mitaka from Shinjuku." "I don't quite get it." "Sorry." "Sense of distance is different here." "We should just go to Tokyo instead." "Now?" "It's only an hour away by expressway." "Yeah, but..." "Let's go. I'll buy Honoka a dress." "No, don't. "Let me." "She's gonna grow out of it quickly." "I wanna buy her a gift." "Right, Honoka?" "Look at her." "We'll eat some good food, too." "We can get clothes here." "C'mon, you deserve a break." "Scene 19: Intersection, national highway." "Scene 20: Handicraft shop, mall." "Are you buying anything?" "No, I'm just looking." "Maybe I'll knit something." "What are you gonna make?" "Now is a good time for a cap." "A cap..." "Honoka stumbles a lot when she's out playing." "And it's getting cold, too." "This is a nice color." "Yeah, it is." "I like this one, too." "That's nice, too." "I would do this and that..." "You're always good at those things." "Well, that's what I like to do." "Remember?" "What?" "That I asked you to knit gloves my boyfriend asked me to knit?" "Yeah, I remember." "They were one of my best works." "I wonder what happened to them." "He can't be using them." "Who knows he might still have them." "You broke up with him soon after, right?" "Yeah, I wasted away the gloves." "I wasted away my effort." "Sorry about that." "What was his name?" "It was Seki." "Right, the one who went to Fuji High." "I wonder what he's doing." "You haven't seen him?" "No, not at all." "Oh..." "Which do you like?" "We'll take this one." "So anything new lately?" "Lately?" "Do you have a boyfriend?" "No, not now." "I see." "Do you want a cap, too, Aki?" "What?" "I have enough wool to make one more." "Scene 28: Counter, convenience store." "Do you have Caster?" "I'm sorry?" "Caster. Cigarettes." "Oh, they don't sell that any more." "I see." "We have Winston." "What?" "A successor to Caster." "I'll take that." "Scene 29: Smoking section, family restaurant." "Scene 30: Kakiuchi's backyard." "At a towering castle in springtime..." "And?" "A band is held to enjoy the flowers." "A banquet is held to enjoy the flowers" "A band is held to enjoy the flowers" "Oh, whatever." "Wasn't it pretty?" "Hey... "Hey, hey, hey..." "What happened? "A bird, a bird." "A bird?" "You're home." "What's going on?" "There was a pretty bird up on the tree there." "Oh..." "We went to see it." "That was nice." "A bird, a bird, a bird." "What's wrong?" "Honoka has a fever." "What?" "She got too excited." "I'm fine." "Are you sure?" "I'm fine. I'm fine." "Scene 31: Kakiuchi's bedroom, early evening." "Scene 32: Kakiuchi's living room, early evening." "I'm sorry." "Don't be. You just happened to be here." "But..." "You don't need to apologize." "Are you angry?" "I'm not angry, so will you stop?" "But..." "She's alright. She just got a little excited, right? "Yeah, she just has a fever." "You're right." - "Calm down." - "I am calm." "You don't seem to be." "I'm sorry." "We'll talk later." "Alright." "I'll walk you home." "Let me help you." "Thanks, but it's a family matter." "See you again." "Yeah." "Scene 37: Non-smoking section, family restaurant." "Scene 38: Kakiuchi's dining room, night." "I don't want to treat you like you're my student." "You need a break sometimes, but this isn't acceptable." "I'm sorry." "You promised to quit until Honoka got older." "I did." "I know I'm making a big deal out of something small." "Yes..." "You know, you should stop hanging out with Aki." "Why?" "I see nothing positive in her now." "The rumor about her bothers you?" "It does." "Maybe she has reasons she can't tell." "Murderers have reasons they can't tell, too." "You're going too far." "I'm sorry. I said too much." "It's alright." "I still think Aki's being intrusive." "She's concerned about us." "Does her concern do us any good?" "Do us any good?" "Yes, for this family." "That's a mean thing to say about someone who cares about us." "No, you need to be more cautious with her." "I don't know..." "I think Aki mixing with us makes us all restless." "You think so?" "Yeah, she's making you and Honoka restless." "Are you blaming her?" "Honoka actually ran a fever." "Well..." "Be careful, or her influence is gonna spread." "I think..." "What?" "You're using logic that works only in schools in our home." "I'm not." "I'm just worried, very worried." "I understand." "I'll tell Aki." "Scene 40: Car on riverside road, inside." "Hello? What is it?" "What? She's fussy?" "I'll come home as soon as I can," "but not any time soon." "I have to go." "Scene 41: Takemoto's living room, next day." "A typhoon formed off the Caroline Islands" "will develop as it goes north, hitting Japan early tomorrow." "Scene 42: Takemoto's front door." "Hi." "Sorry about the other day." "Don't be." "Why are you dressed like that?" "I need to run some errands." "I see." "Is Honoka better?" "Oh, she's up and around." "Good. Where's she now?" "She's with my parents." "You wanna come in?" "No, my parents are expecting me." "Oh, okay." "Here." "What is it?" "A wool cap. I knitted it." "Thanks. Can I open it?" "Sure." "Nice... I like it." "How does it look?" "It looks nice on you." "Thank you." "I'm glad you're still here." "What do you mean?" "I heard you and Naoto had a quarrel." "Yes, we quarreled." "We talked about it." "And Naoto thinks we need some space from you." "What are you saying?" "He's very sensitive now, and we don't want to excite Honoka either." "And...?" "So..." "I'm sorry, but I have to ask you not to visit us for a while." "Are you saying it's my fault?" "I'm really sorry for what's happening." "You don't really mean it, do you?" "I'm sorry." "If you need help, just tell me." "Scene 43: Bridge." "Scene 44: Aki's room, night." "Scene 45: Takemoto's corridor to living room, night." "Hello, Mr. Toyama?" "Yes, it's me. Aki." "I've been with my parents." "Yes, I'm okay." "And thank you for your email." "No..." "I'll be back in Tokyo tomorrow. I'm wondering if we can meet." "What? A typhoon?" "It's approaching?" "Scene 51: Takemoto's living room." "Hello?" "Can you do me a favor?" "What is it?" "I have to go out." "NOW?" "Yes." "And?" "I want you to babysit Honoka." "Can you do that?" "Scene 52: Bridge." "Scene 53: Kakiuchi's house, exterior." "Scene 54: Kakiuchi's front door." "Thank goodness, you're here." "No problem." "Hey, you look really nice." "I hope you won't tell Naoto about this." "I won't. Just do what you have to do." "Thanks. I'll be back soon." "Scene 55: Faculty room, middle school." "Mr. Kakiuchi, you worry too much about your family." "Yes, but..." "Worry about your students, too." "Yes, of course..." "Scene 56: Kakiuchi's living room." "Honoka, take a look at this." "Scene 58: Kakiuchi's living room." "It's sunny!" "Outside!" "Not now. It's clear only for a minute." "I wanna go out!" "I said no." "NO!" "Honoka.” "At a towering castle in spring time..." "What do you say?" "A band is held to enjoy the flowers." "Scene 59: Footpath, rice field." "Scene 60: Smoking section, family restaurant." "I pray for your success." "For your success." "Scene 61: Bridge." "You've had enough. Let's go home." "It's enough." "Hey, watch it." "Here, here!" "It's raining. Let's go home." "I'm okay." "You can come back." "No. I'm okay." "Don't be fooled. It's only quiet now." "A bad storm is coming back soon." "At a towering castle in springtime..." "Your turn." "At a towering castle in springtime..." "Your turn." "At a towering castle in springtime..." "Scene 62: Kitchen, Aki's flat in Tokyo, a few days later." "Scene 63: Living room, Aki's flat." "I can easily say" "that I am sorry, or that I did it for you." "Partly this is how I feel." "Yet I feel this is not how I truly feel." "When said out loud, all my feelings sound untrue." "So by writing this letter," "I hope to arrive at my truth." "On the day of the typhoon, I pushed the girl into the river." "After she was put into my care, she wanted to go and see the river." "When we were at the bridge, I shoved her." "She didn't fall into the river because she slipped." "I pushed her from the back." "I had no intention of doing this until that very moment." "I've never premeditated my action nor even thought about it." But I was clearly conscious of what I was doing," "and I decided on my own to push her into the water." "Now I will talk about the domain." "Our kingdom." "We talked about it the other day." "It's the kingdom of chairs and sheets we made on that day of the typhoon." "On that day and at that place, we were able to create" "a world that was different in time and space." "The gate to the kingdom always opened when you gave the signal." "The words we used" "and the tone with which we spoke those words ruled the kingdom." "The words we spoke had their own domain." "Speaking those words would take us to the kingdom" "whenever and wherever we were." "Even without the castle of sheets," "speaking the words would make our kingdom appear." "Many a time we've been to the kingdom only we shared." "It was on top of the slide, under the table, and in the woods." "Placed on a highland with a magnificent view," "the kingdom grew larger and larger." "However, I came to learn" "that others had their own kingdoms just as we did." "You must have noticed it, too, as you grew older." "Our kingdom was just another kingdom in this world." "As I matured, I was able to share territories with others as well," "and I've been to each one of them." "You, your husband, and your daughter" "had your own special domain." "I could sense it." "Every day you and your husband strove to maintain your domain," "getting ready to usher in your daughter who was learning to speak." "But that wasn't all you had." "You also had a physical domain of your own." "I'm talking about your little house." "It was a cozy house" "with the right temperature and humidity." "The house was part of the kingdom you and your husband had built." "That's how I felt." "But I also noticed your kingdom had flaws and was vulnerable." "I knew your physical kingdom" "was a suffocating and unbearable place for you." "It was as if you were in the eye of a typhoon." "Your safety wouldn't last." "Like the sudden storm you encounter once you are out of the eye," "I could see the very kingdom you had built would attack you." "In that sense, your kingdom was already decisively impaired." "That day I was standing on the bridge and looking at the muddy stream." "Just then I let out the password," "the password to go to our kingdom." "It was meant to calm the child down." "But as it came out of my mouth," "I felt as if you were standing next to me." "And at the same time, I saw the door to our kingdom." "I also realized" "that the girl was not you." "Thinking that you'd appear," "I had to eliminate her, who was not supposed to be there." "If asked who was more important, you or the girl," "you were undoubtedly more important to me." "No one would really understand what I'm trying to say." "But..." "only you may be able to." "By all means, however..." "please do not feel guilty." "And please..." "do not regard our kingdom something that was wrong." "It's because that day of the typhoon" "belongs not only to the past, but also to the future." Okay, guys. This is rehearsal. Ready? Action! Jonan Middle School? You teach there? Yeah, since this April. So you're an art teacher there. What? Don't you know? You mean the school violence? So you knew. Nodoka reacted just as you did. The kids seem to be different now. Really? You just stereotyped them because Jonan kids looked intimidating. You may be right. We went to an all-girls school, so... No, that doesn't matter. You disagree? The kids were so violent they broke all the windows in school. Yeah, I remember... We were there together. It was cold. What? A girl we knew went to Jonan and joined the school band. It was Macky. Yeah, Macky the Glockenspiel Player. Are you sure? Wasn't it just Macky the Glocken? Maybe it was. But "Macky the Glockenspiel Player" sounds familiar. Which was it? Let me see... Whichever it was, go on. How far did I tell you? Macky joined the band. That's right. And...? The band's annual concert. Right. She invited us to her school for a concert. It was a totally different world. The gym had no windows. What used to be windows were covered with cardboard. And the wind was battering against it. We couldn't hear the band. There were lots of graffiti, too. All over the walls. Now it's all clean and the kids aren't rowdy, either But they still have bullies and truants. More or less... Not that I'm talking about anyone special. I know. So I first thought you're teaching graffiti there. I could see you teaching it with a straight face. Yeah? I agree. Really? You see logic in everything. I do? How about you, Aki? Are you still with the publisher? Yeah, sort of... I didn't know editors' work was so tough. I was shocked. You have to explain first. Sorry. What is it? My classmate, Matsuura... You probably don't know him. He just joined a publisher and told us what it was to be an editor. I see... Man, it sounded like hell. Did you study editing from manuscripts your superiors threw away? What? That's what he was saying. Oh... Oops, I did it again. That's alright. I've heard about those things, but not with my publisher. Is that so? Besides I'm not an editor. You're not? I'm on the production side, that is, printing, binding, and the like. I see. Of course, we talk with the editors a lot, but there's no hierarchy like the major publishers have. Good. I was a bit worried about you. You'd be fine anywhere. Yeah, Aki's really tough. You said you were worried. Yeah, but... What I meant to say was... I know what you wanted to say. Good. There. Oh. Be careful. Right. See? Sorry. There you go. What? A coded circuit. A coded circuit? Is this what it is? Yeah. What is it? It means you two can talk without words. He says we always talk like that. Actually, you're conveying more without words. Are we? When we were students, I really thought you were using codes. He says our coding rules change. Even the rules are coded, so it's just impossible to decipher. But don't you guystalk in a similar way? Do we? You can eliminate words only when you've shared many experiences. Right. So it's only natural for longtime acquaintances. Well, I don't know... We try to use words all the time. Yeah, that's our rule. That sounds painful. Yeah? Words help make things go smoothly. Isn't it stifling? Not at all. You're being too frank, Aki. Am I? She's using words, and that's good. Are you sleepy, Honoka? Let's take you to bed. Cut! "Scene 13-3, take 11."
