No way Then he ain't that big is he? By the way, if anyone asks, Rita is an exchange student I think I just sat on your adding machine Now I know what happened to the fish tank Coach Robert "The Buzzer" Fernando was a caretaker by profession What a wonderful word that is to describe his devotion to his fellow man he truly took care When Robert knew that his time was short He told me there was one specific man he wanted to say a few words to memorialize him So I'd like to ask Lenny Feder to come up now I'm sorry I'm not prepared at all I ... I'm I feel very honored that ... that Coach asked me to do this but uh ... I also feel terrible, because I haven't seen the coach in so long And um... he always wanted me to come into town and see him and uh ... I got caught up in what I've been doing and I regret it I understand that the St. Mark's team of 1978 was the only championship team that the coach ever had and uh ... That's very impressive I've got to say, judging from the talent we had to offer I mean, believe it or not Robbie and Marcus were actually shorter in back 1979 Yeah but those guys had a skill that you never masterd They knew how to pass the ball Looks like somebody has to learn how to pass the Kentucky Fried Chicken I'm kidding I'm kidding We're saying goodbye to a big part of our lives All of us You affected everybody in his room and um ... I hope we get to live our lives like you Have no regrets when life's final buzzer sounds So uh, let's all bow our heads in silence Ave Maria...Gratia plena They should have just ended it right after you This is insanity -Yeah, five bucks, it takes him down on one knee Oh you're on - Ok Maria Gratia plena Ave, ave dominus dominus tecum.

I've gotta say he seems like he's in love you know Well, he was in love with the first three wives too The cheater, the beater and the eater Yeah You know, his problem is he's always so overly in love so quick and then one day he snaps and then it get's ugly in a hurry Coffee Mr. Feder? Uh... No, no, no, no I'm good, I'm good I mean I thank you That's cool of you to voluntarily want to give me coffee Just uh... you drink it you know while you're studying inside the church But you texted me you want coffee I texted you that I wanted you to drink the coffe and study So study Your books in the church Go ahead All right Rita Mommy, I want some milk Oh sure angel, come here Let's give you a little something Slow down honey.
