You know, tryin' to work out. Keep my body tight, too. Well, I appreciate it, but you already tight. You know that. Thank you. Look, have you heard anything else about that case? Nah, I'm still wrackin' my brain around that case. I don't know exactly. Waitin' on a phone call to come in as we speak. - Trust me, I know. - That's why I'm here workin' out now. I understand. It can be stressful. So, what you got goin' after this? I don't know. Probably head back to the house until the call come in, you know what I mean? Everything okay? Yeah. No. Sorry about that.

So, I guess my meeting you tonight was perfect, right? What you mean? I mean, I'm just saying I need a woman like you in my life. Is that right? Yeah. Why? Look at you girl. Smart, funny. Hella sexy. And I bet you got a killer bed game. Oh, what? You know. And how you know that? I got a thousand reasons to say I do. Look, I don't want your money, so, I'll just send it back to you. 'Cause I was just playin'. Look, I'm a business man. So, think of it as an investment. I don't want your money, okay? So, don't worry about it. Wait, where you goin'? I said don't worry about it. I said another time. And fuck, I said you're my damn investment. I said another time. I ain't tryin' to do this right now. Look. The fuck you think I am, huh? You think this a game?

Man, where your badge at? Why need a badge when I got a gun? Man, you lucky I'm with you. Look, if you was walkin' somewhere, would you survive holding a badge or a gun? Whatever. Hey, Carter, I found somethin'. Hey, what do we have here? All right. He is a 31 year old victim. Strangulation marks around his neck. Possibly from a belt or a cord. But the victim was David Michael Crouse. And, also, witnesses say they saw a car come by at around 3ish, but did not get a description of the car or the driver. We have anything else? Cash? Credit card? Well, no cash in the wallet. All credit cards looks to be intact. However, we did find a briefcase a couple feet away with only some paperwork, a coupla phones and some condoms. I told you. Condoms. See, Derek? Yo. Carter. Found somehtin'. This person worked for a high-end service. Diamond Services. They left their card. Found this over there. Okay. Hey, hey, B, how you doin'? You lookin' fine this mornin'. Also, if you can, check to see if they got any cameras. May have some footage. All right. I'll get that done. Thank you. No problem. Woo. She gonna me win that thing. You know what I'm sayin'? Really, Fred? Really? We have a dead body here. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. I found a piece of hair. Over there. Look like a woman's hair. Hair? Yeah. Look like a woman hair. You know, women, they killers. So, you mean to tell me you think the killer's a woman? Hey, when you've dated women, they get mad at you, they kill your ass. Looks like that to me. Yeah, you should know that, man. You deal with crazy women all day, every day. Got the evidence. Let's roll out. All right. Man, that was very crazy to see David layin' down there and we tryin' to figure out who killed him, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm still tryin' to figure that out, man. I hope we get some evidence real soon. I still believe it was a woman. Here you go, man. Why do you think it's a woman? I found a piece of woman hair. You didn't see that evidence I gave you in the bag? A piece of woman hair? I saw it. Well, do- - Hello? Hello? Hello? Did I catch you at a bad time? Yo, is this who I think it is? Um, who do you think it is? Oh, you got jokes. 'Course not. I thought you forgot about me. Mm, I was thinking lunch, maybe? Lunch? Hell yeah, I like the sound of that. We can do lunch. So, there's this little spot I like to go to. It's downtown. It's on the corner, I think, of Madison? Oh, that's one of my favorite spots. Yeah? So, how about 2 o'clock? Is that good for you? Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Tell you what, I'll meet you over there in about an hour. Yep, that's perfect. All right. See you soon. So, who we meetin' about an hour? We ain't meetin' nobody. I got a date. Hey, I wanna go on a date. I wanna go too. You ain't goin' nowhere. Hey, I want some lunch, too! You got the car. Oh, good evening, miss. How are you? Hi, how are you doing? Doing good. Can I interest you in a drink tonight? I'm actually waiting on a friend, but when they get here, we'll probably order somethin'. Okay. Hey. Sorry, I'm late. Hey. Had a long day today? Yeah, you know. Seein' out the... What? What? What is it? No, you're good. Just me. I just wasn't expectin' so much beauty. Thank you. Yeah, I'm sure you get that a lot, though. Yeah, it doesn't hurt to hear it again. So, how's your day goin'? Oh, so far- - Can I interest you guys in some drinks tonight? Champagne? Red, white? Sure, you- Know you was talkin' about champagne earlier, you? Mmhm. Okay. Get two glasses of Don Perigon. Okay. You have a good taste, I see. Of course. I know my wines and champagnes, Rieslings, you name it. Okay. So how's your day goin'? So far, day's goin' good. Just got better seein' you, though. That's sweet. Two Dons. - Thank you. - Thank you. And were you guys ready to order? Yeah, actually, what's your special of the day? Well, currently, our customers love our chicken steak and ala carte. And then you can get a side of mashed potatoes as well and gravy with that. Hm. Okay, so, is it possible that I could order chicken ala carte, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, and also a side of green beans? Of course. I'll have the same. Okay. Be back in a couple minutes. Good choice. You wanna be like me. Yeah, of course. So, what, or who, keeps you busy? Well, if you're referring to a woman, that's not keepin' me busy. But, my job, of course, yes. That keeps me very busy. Okay, well, what do you do? I'm a detective. Oh. Interesting. How long you been doin' that? I've been doin' it for about 13 years now. Okay. That's quite some time. Yeah. Are you okay about that? Of course. Why wouldn't I be? Okay. Cool, cool. Well, enough about me. I need to know more about you, so. What's up with this retail therapy and shoppin'? Is that all you do? It's not all I do. Okay. Thank you. There you are. Is there anything else I can get you guys tonight? Um, I think we're good for now. Thank you. I'll be around the corner if you need anything. This looks amazing. Yeah. Gonna try these green beans here. Gotta get your veggies in. Mm. These are so good. Tastes pretty good? Mmhm. You should try 'em out. I see why this is the special of the day. Right? So, I mean, I shop quite a bit, but I've been tryin' to cut back on it. You came in with the jokes tonight, I see. Of course. You know, you shoppin' at home depot. What a woman doin' there? So, you grill? You do your own barbecue? I saw that charcoal. I try to do somethin' from time to time. I'm not gonna say I'm the best, but. Okay. Make somethin' happen. May have to try some sometime. Might have to. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I do a little bit when I can, though. But I'm always on the basketball court with my detective partner, Fred. Tend to try to stay in shape, you know. Do what I can. That's good. I could manage to hit the gym a little more. Okay. So. I appreciate you for bringin' me here. It's a really nice restaurant. Most definitely. I mean, it's not too much, right? Mm-Mm. Okay. It's perfect. It's perfect. I'm pretty simple, so, you know, I mean. I like movies. I like music. Love concerts, love goin' to concerts. Mm, okay. Damn, I'm enjoyin' this food and I'm enjoyin' you right now. It's not everyday I get a chance to sit with someone as beautiful as you now. Look at you boostin' my head up over here. Uh huh. I mean, you deserve it. Well, I thank you. Mmhm. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here. Mmhm. Hold on, let me take this real quick. Oh, go ahead. Enjoying the evening? Mmhm. Are we? I am, thanks for asking. Need any refills? Need anything extra? Um, not at the moment, but I do wanna say that this is a lovely special that you recommended. And I see why everyone likes it. It's really good. Oh, of course. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, sorry about that. Oh, you're fine. Had to take that call. It was my detective partner. They need me down at the station. Oh, is everything okay? Yes and no. Gotta go check out some stuff that we've been investigating. Oh, okay. But, yeah, it looks like I'm about to leave though. Oh, that's so sad you have to leave so soon. We were just gettin' started. Trust me. I don't even wanna leave. Yeah. But, is there a way I could make it up to you? Let's say about later on tonight? Dinner? Mmm. I know you're free. You've already told me you're free for the rest of the evening. We could do that. I'd like that. I think that's a good idea. Okay. I tell you what. I'll give you a call around 7. Okay. And you can text me your address? Okay. And I'll see you there, all right? Alrighty, we can do that. Okay. Oh. Pay for our dinner as well, too. I'm not gonna leave you hangin'. Thank you. 'Cause I'd hate to come out in my costume in such an expensive place. Yeah. Already know. Trust me. All right, well I'll see you later, okay? Thank you. - All right. - Mkay. Hey Karen. Any evidence come back from the lab from the murder for David? No, I've sent the evidence to the lab, but I haven't got anything back. Been searchin' through the paperwork, but no such luck. Well, actually we did get some evidence to come back from the lab, but waitin' on Carter to come in so we can all can discuss that. You know how it is. Waitin' on Carter, as usual. Yeah. Speakin' of Carter. There he is comin' through the door now. So, what's up, man? Yeah, while you were havin' your powwow dinner, we were over here starvin'. C'mon, man, really? Did the cameras pick up anything? No, just a car comin' in, a car goin' in. It's the only thing the camera picked up. Well, actually, there's a car service on the company's credit. From a pickup from his job to a bar about two miles away. And the bartender said he met about three men there? They talked for about an hour and then they all left out around 11 that night. Any credit card uses? No, we're still waitin' on evidence to come in, too. So, uh. Tell you what I'm thinkin'. Let's call up that bartender. And find out if there was a woman around him at any time durin' that meetin'. A woman? Yeah, we found a long string of hair at the scene. You know, just in case. Oh, also, the lab results hasn't come back from the lab yet. Yeah. Go ahead and pull up those phone records on him. And find out if there was any type of car service. We'll see if it's the same car service that was used that night. All right. I'll get on that. Okay, I'm gonna check on some more evidence myself. Okay. Hey. Hey. - You like? - You look amazing. Thank you. You can come on in. All right. Champagne that we had earlier? Mmhm. I took you up on your advice, 'cause it was so good. I went and got a bottle today. Oh, the Don Perigon. Mmhm. Mmhm. Well, I'm glad I could help you with the assist on that. Definitely. That was my first time havin' it. So. And I really enjoyed it. I was like, "Well, he's comin' over later so let me get somethin'". You know, that you like, as well. And it's really good to me, so. Well I appreciate that. That let's me know that you do like a brother over here a little bit more. I do. And I see you and you said it so confident. And I was like, "Oh he knows what he's talkin' about". So. I guess it pays off, right? Can learn a little somethin'. It does. So, enough of all of this. What do you like doin' and, like, you know? What's some of your favorite movies? Action, drama, comedy? I do like comedy. I love to laugh, so comedy's probably my favorite. And horror. Horror. Action's cool, too, but horror keeps you, like, on your toes. Like, what's gonna happen next? What's gonna happen next? So, I'm always interested in horror. Okay. Yeah, I like a lot of comedy. Horror? Here or there, you know. Depends on when I feel like watchin' it. What about romantic movies? How you like those? Notebook? Love dramas? Surprisingly, The Notebook is one of my favorites. That typical love story, you know, that everyone wants, but. I don't watch too many romance movies, but when I do catch a good one, it's really good. Well, maybe I can help change your mind on that. Maybe, we might have to catch a few of those movies together. I think so. I have to admit, though. This is probably the best date I've ever been on in quite a while. Really? Yeah. I know I may be movin' too fast, but I'm really fallin' for you, though. Kinda makes me feel like I'm doin' a little somethin' right, you know? So, it's good. I'm glad you're enjoyin' yourself. There's nothin' like a laid-back, you know, type of vibe. Yes. It's somethin' different. You don't have to go out all the time and dress up. And dress up and stuff. I'm gettin' tongue-tied with my words. I'm always gettin' caught up in my words around you. Stop. You're so freakin' gorgeous. I have to thank God, I guess, and my parents for that, huh? Most definitely. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe I was too straightforward. Just a bit. But, I have other things in mind, though Oh, really? Yes. Let's get you out of this. Oh, okay. Woo. Wow. That was amazing. Oh man. I'm tellin' you. That move you just put on me. I have never experienced that before in my life. Really? Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong, I've had my fair share of women, but I don't know. There's just somethin' about you. Oh, well, I'm glad I could satisfy you. Well you did enough. I didn't hurt you though, did I? No, no. Well, maybe you did. But I did like it, though I don't know. There's just something about you though. It's like, you're just this mysterious person, you know? It's almost like you're secretive, but in a great way. How so? I don't know. It's just like every time I see you is, like, you get me. We just gel for some reason. Don't you feel the same way?

Hi, good morning. Anybody see Carter come in? Yes. He's in his office. I gotta speak with him. Hey, got some leads about that car. Oh okay, what's good? You slashed. What? Man, you didn't go home, man. And you wore the same shirt. Means you didn't go home. Man, I don't know what you're talkin' about, man. Man. I was gettin' worried about you. So, how was she? How was the sex? Well, for your information, her name is Vanessa. I met her the other day at the mall. And, since you asked about the sex game. Boy, that's on a level, man. Ooh, damn. Yeah. That what I'm talkin' about, man. You smashed an 11. So, what does she do? And she cooked some breakfast for a brother this mornin', man. Damn, she cooks? Damn. Man. She must be ugly or somethin'. Nah, she ain't ugly, man. She far from ugly, man. She got, like, the beauty, the brain, smart as hell, man. And that body. Man. Man, Carter. Now you gazin'. You gazin'. What? You gazin'. You gazin'. What you talkin' about? Man, I see your eyes. Your gazin', man. You're in love, man. Whatever, man. I knew it. I tell you one thing. I'm not whipped, though. Psh. Naw, you whipped, dog, you whipped. Yeah, man. I don't know, man. Just somethin' about her. I can't even explain it, man. Oh, hey, what's goin' on? Dog. Good morning. I tried calling you last night. Really? Yep. Sorry, I was busy doin' somethin'. Yeah. He was tied up, all right. Oh, hey, I'm gonna go check on the evidence. Yeah, you do that. I'll be back. Whatever. I didn't know you were seein' someone. Yeah, I mean, well. I just met her. You know, just kinda goin' through the motions right now. So, there ain't nothin' set in stone. Oh. Well. I got this autopsy report. Thought you might wanna see it. Oh, yeah, most definitely. Appreciate that. Hey, um, Officer Lee. Yes? Is everything all right? Yeah. I'm fine. Hey, girl, I thought you was gonna leave me hangin'. I'm sorry, girl, I got a late start this mornin'. Hmm. So, what's his name? Name? Mr. Late Start? Derek. Derek? Ain't that the dude that ran into you in the parking lot the other day? Girl, yes. Him. Ew, you really like him, don't you? A little bit. Ew. Okay, wait a minute. The only reason you fall for a man that fast is if he got a lotta money. Or he good in bed. Which one is it? Well, honey, he definitely ain't rich. You nasty. You a hoe. What? Excuse me. I don't sleep with every man that I meet. Unlike somebody that I know. Thank you. Oh, okay. It's only the ones with money, honey. Girl, I'm tired, man. Tired? We ain't did nothin' but walk. Look, I'm outta shape. Girl, please. You smaller than me and you tired? It don't mean you in shape just 'cause you I'm small. You are so silly. I'm just glad it's about to be over, okay? Ooh yeah. You have to catch me back at the trail in two weeks. Stretch out the leg before we get outta here. Yeah. So what happened to that guy the other night? Old boy with all the money. Oh, girl, him? He was a straight asshole. Psh. Ain't they all? Well, not Derek. He'll be one soon. Don't be a hater. What? I'm just sayin'. So what? You, um, you drivin' tonight? Probably not. Girl, I'm so tired. I'm so tired. Yeah, I bet. You need to stop. It's gettin' dangerous. I heard they found some dude's body. Dead in some building about, not like too far from here? Really? Yes. Do they know what happened? I think they said he got choked. Yeah. And he took some type of driver service, so that was the last person to see him alive. So they tryin' to find the driver. His driver? Yeah, to see if they know anything. Hm. Hm, you know anything about that? Girl, naw, of course not. Okay, I'm just makin' sure. It's gettin' a little dangerous out here. You don't need to be out here just drivin'. I hope they catch him. Like, for real. Girl, you know I'm always careful. I know, but, I don't want anything to happen to you. Oh stop. I got this. You know I love you. Thank you for carin', boo. All right, girl, I'ma call you later, okay? Okay. Love you, boo. Love you, too. Who is it? It's Derek. Hey. Is it okay if I stop by? Okay. This way. Yeah, I was in the area. You know, I called you a few times. You didn't answer, so. It's okay. Okay. What just happened? What you mean? You just erased my whole day. Did I? Yes. Well, since I already erased your day, how 'bout you rub a little lotion on my legs for me? I guess I can do that. Thank you. So, how's your day been? So-so. Hmm? I mean, this case, man, just got me buggin' right now. Yeah, stressin' you out? Yeah it is. You know. Still haven't got no calls in. Or none of that. Yeah, that sucks. Hopefully it gets better. Yeah. Though, one thing that I can say, beyond that. Is all day, I just knew I had to come and see you, though. Oh, I'm glad that you popped up, 'cause I kinda been wantin' to see you too. Really? Mmhm. Come here. What's this, our third game? I'm kickin' your butt, girl. Yeah, okay. I'ma beat you on this last one, though. Watch. Mmhm. We'll see about that. Come on, show me what you got. 'Cause I got a good hand up in here. You know, on a serious note. I haven't got a chance to ask, you know. Are you lookin' for somebody? Like, a husband? Yes and no. More so like a boyfriend. You know. Boo thang. Mm, I don't know. I've tried the whole boyfriend dating thing and it just didn't work for me. But it could, right? I mean, you said it yourself. Until the right guy comes along. And you think that you're him? You don't think so? I mean. How do you know if I'm the right one for you? Because I can feel it. Hm. Okay. Well, sometimes feelin's can be deceivin'. That's true. But, since I met you, I know it's true. I can feel it. Hm. On that note, I have a little somethin' for you. Somethin' for me? Oh yes, you. Excited. Ooh it's so pretty. Are these? Yes, dolphins on a bracelet. You know dolphins represents intelligence and integrity. And that represents you. Well you just taught me something new. That was very kind of you. Thank you so much. That's so sweet. You're welcome. I love it. I can't wait to wear it. I'm glad you do. May have to put it on when you get me for another date. Okay. There. Now, besides that, come on, time to go ahead and beat you in this game real quick. All right. See what you got. I know you don't want these problems, but. King. Oh, club? Oh, well, I ain't got nothin' for that, though. Mm. Startin' off good already. Go on. Mmm. Throw this one out. Diamond. Man, I got nothin'. See, see? What's wrong, man, you tired? So, Vanessa put it on you last night, right? Really? Come on, man. I tell you that, though. I think she may be the one. How the hell you think she the one when you don't know anything about her? Man, sometimes you just know. Now, I can live without knowin' who crossed that dude. I've been rackin' my brain on it all night, man. Yeah, but I still think it's a woman. Did you hear anything about the car service? Ah, man, no voicemail, no address. No anything. Nothing. Comin' up with nothin'. So, either somebody was waitin' for that person or he hooked up with somebody. Huh. I still think it's a woman. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Carter here. Good. Hey, go ahead and follow that trail. Keep an eye on it. And get back with me, all right? Aight, appreciate it. What? Closure, man. Gettin' in on that bank card, man. Somebody took out a thousand dollars. On that prepaid card. I know it's a woman. A woman? Man, what the hell's a thousand dollars? Ah, it could be anything. Anything, anywhere. You know, sometimes I worry about you. So, uh, you goin' out to spite the night with me tonight? Or are you gonna hang out with Vanessa? Look, I ain't gotta worry about chasin' her when I got some already talkin' like I told you before. Nah, man, she gotta work, anyway. You definitely called it. She gotta work anyway. It's fine. Probably gonna go home, work out, chill for the night. While you down there chillin', I'll be down there takin' all them dudes' money. Now, you know that's illegal, right? Put all your morals away for the night. It's just for tonight. I'm gonna have you for cards. Tell me about it. Work for a high-end service. For Diamond Services. They left their card. All right, put your money in the pot. In the pot. Money in the pot. Come on, man. Come on, come on. Aw man. Crapped out, man. Your roll, your roll. Hey, man, put the beer can down, man. Come watch me shoot, man. This man be drinkin' all the time. Come on, hurry man. Bitch, why you takin' the money, man? Just set the dice down. My fault. Hey, roll it, roll it again. Roll again. Come on. Roll it again. Hey, man, you got these die rigged, cus. You got these die rigged. Aw, you crapped out, man. Come on. You crapped out. Come on, put your money down. Put your money down, man. Come on, hurry up. Put everything in, man. Let's go. Let's go.

Hey, we gotta take this man. He been drinkin' too much. You all right? Oh, man, come on. Hey, dog, you okay? Let's take this dude home, man. Man, you gotta go to the doctor's. Hey, you got a ride, man? Yeah, I'm good. I got one. Ride where? She right there. She? Yeah. - Who's she? - Who's she? That's my girlfriend. Girl, girlfriend? You ain't talkin' 'bout no girl, man. I'm takin' you back to your car, man. Who is this? Who's pickin' you up? That's my girl. Is she takin' you home? Yeah, I got this. Don't I know you? All right, take him home. Aight, man, we'll call you later, dog. Damn, she looks good. I've seen her somewhere before. I don't know, man. Somewhere. That ain't a good thing. I don't know, man. I've been tryin' to wrap my head around this case all night. My intuition is tellin' me that this was a robbery. He was picked up, they got his PIN number, they stole a thousand dollars before they end up killin' him, and then they dumped his body off at a parkin' lot. So, why not take the jewelry and the credit cards? I mean, any thief would know how and where to fence that stuff. That is true. But, either they didn't know how or they just didn't have time. So, you think that this could be their first kill? Yeah, maybe. That's what I'm tryin' to find out. Hey, what's the connection between the killer and the victim? Ah, the connection's the car service. How? I mean that the driver was the last person to see the victim alive. But, you said it yourself that last draw was around 9 PM. I mean, he was picked up around 11 PM. And was found dead around three. Well, somethin's tellin' me we need to check into the car service that he took. Maybe right. Hey, Officer Lee? Yeah? Hey, can you check into the car service and find out who picked up Mr. Cars that night? Sure. Who's that? What is what? Hello? Okay, we're on our way. We just got another homicide, man. Really? Yes. We gotta go. They're said to saying threatening comments to her. She's concerned he might return. Everything okay? Yeah, it's just the normal routine around here. I got somethin' to tell you, man. What you got to tell me? It's Henry. Oh, it's Henry. Henry? For- Oh man. What happened? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know him? Yeah, we've been brothers since we was kids, man. I mean, we just hung last night. Last night, man. Shootin' dice. You know, that old spot I was tellin' you about. Oh, man. God. Well, did he drive home? Knew I shoulda took him. No, he was drunk, man. Said he was gonna call a car. A driver. He took a car service, man. And it was a girl. When I looked at her, he'll know, I seen her somewhere before. He was spooked. And I said you was spooked. Do you know what kind of car? Remember how to- - It was a black car with tinted windows and some light-skinned chick was in there, but I remember seeing her somewhere before. I was tellin' him about it, too. Man. Homeboy, man. This looks like the murder weapon right here, man. Damn. See that? Broom got blood on it. Yeah, looks like. Somebody did a number on this broom. Oh, man. Hey, man, let me call this in. Let me get your radio, man. Detective Fred to dispatch. Got a DOA over at Griffith South and Cooper. Need an ambulance on the scene ASAP. This bag got some blood on it, too. Hey, man, put all that in the bag. You got a bag, Carter? Get this to the lab ASAP, man. And if you find any other fingerprints other than the victim, let us know. Find anything else, Carter? Hey, I see a bracelet. A bracelet? What's this right here? Oh, man, whoever it is, it's gotta be a female, man. Left a bracelet. Bracelet. You know anything about that card? Hey, you know what? This was the same card that was left on the scene with David. Don't you remember Diamond Services? The same card. You remember? Yeah. It's the same car service. And I bet it's the same chick. Because of the bracelet. A female bracelet. Ooh, it's so pretty. Hey, man. Why you lookin' like this, man? I dunno. It's just startin' to add up a little bit. Hey, Carter, you gotta let me in on this case, man. Come on, man. I know how you feel. I know it's your own. But, wait, I mean this is my folks, man. I know, man. Look, I just need you to have a clearer mind, man. Go home, man. Just go home. Let me handle this. Oh, oh. Cover him up, man. Man. Damn. You sure you don't know anything about it? I ain't got no connection to it. Like, I don't even know who that girl is. He got spooked, but I'm, like, I don't know who she was. I thought she was a random chick. Man. Nobody answerin'. Hey, Carter. Hope you're putting as much effort in findin' out who killed my brother as you're chasin' this girl. Now, come on, Freddy, you know it ain't like that, man. I been sittin' here all night, man. Wrackin' my brain around this case. And, either there's a serial killer or these are all connected to a group of murderers, or just some random murder. Random murder? That boy was killed in his home, man. Not murdered just like this other guy. They both were robbed and whoever did this, man, they knew they had money. Look, man, we just gotta think about this, man. And find out if there's a connection with these two murders. And, finally got who's doin' this. Or whoever's doin' this. By the way, man, didn't you say someone picked him up that night? I don't know, man. Left the room downstairs, somethin' about a diamond. Diamond? Hey, you know long island tea is my favorite drink, right? I do know it's your favorite. And we're keeping all the classic drinks, but we're bringing in something new that I think you'll like called The Ultimate Long Island Ice Tea. Wow, that's fine. Hey, what's up, man? Hello. Hey, what's going on? This my homegirl, Vanessa. How you doin'? - Hello, how you doin'? - Nice to meet you. You as well. Your face look very familiar. Mm. I been here a few times with my friend girl, so it might be. I ain't seen you in here. It's just somewhere else I've seen you before. Somewhere. Very familiar. I don't know. Maybe I just have a familiar face. Maybe so. Vanessa, you wanna go get a drink? Please, I'd love to. Talk to you later. Anyway, like I was sayin'. So, The Ultimate Long Island is kind of like a regular Long Island, but you go light on the sweet stuff- - Hey, what's up? Hey, what's goin' on? I'm good. So, that Carter and Vanessa? Yeah, that's the "Vanessa". You know what I'm sayin'? All right, well I gotta get back to work. Okay. I'll see you soon. Yeah, nice talkin' to you. Nice talkin' to you. Have a seat.

Man, you know she fine as hell. Hey, Vanessa, right? Do I know you? Oh, my apologies. I'm Nicki. A friend of Carter's? Oh, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. So, um, where did you guys meet? Um, we met not too long ago at this gathering one of my friend's had. So we have a mutual friend. Oh, okay. Well, Carter's a nice guy. Yes, you're right about that. Yeah, but what does she do? I mean, I think, like, she got her own business or somethin'. I mean, honestly we never really talk about it. You don't know what she do, man? Really? Come on, Carter. Hey. What's goin' on? How are you doin'? Doin' all right. So, I see you met Vanessa. Yeah, we met near the restroom. Oh, okay. So, Vanessa. What do you do? I mean, you know. So, I work in a few clubs, but other than that. Really? Hey, man, I'm just tryin' to find out somethin' about your girl 'cause I believe we know more about her than you do. Okay. I just seen some of my friends, so I'm gonna go catch up with them, okay? What was that all about, man? Hey, man, I just asked a question, that's all. You were interrogating her, man. Really? I just asked a question. Man, you been hatin' on her since day one. Since the day I met her. And right now, you're ruinin' our friendship. Look. He had his best intentions, Derek. Nobody's tryin' to ruin your relationship. Maybe not. But, right now this friendship is over? Really? Carter. Carter. Carter. Come on, Derek. Hey, babe. Y'all, this is Carter. Hm. You like, you like?
