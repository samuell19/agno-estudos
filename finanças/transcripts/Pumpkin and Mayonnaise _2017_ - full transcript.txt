Pumpkin and Mayonnaise Excuse me. Excuse me, sorry. credits So starting next week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, okay? Okay. What will you do about your age? My age? I'm 27. You could lie about it. What do the others do? It depends, it's common for most of us take five years off. - Five years... - I said I was 25 when I was 32. The men always go for younger women. Is that so? Well, do you think about 23 is fine? Do what you want. If you're really going to lie about it, don't mistake your birth year and zodiac sign. - Hello. - Hi. This is the new girl, her name is... Tsuchida. - That's no good. - It's not? Think up a name. - A name? Anything is fine, something like Miho or Miki. Well, how about Miho then? Kanako, make some business cards for Miho. Okay. Is Miho spelt phonetically alright? Yes. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. - You new? Introduce yourself to him. - I'm Miho. - Huh? I'm Miho. Miho! What a glum face! Are you okay? - Are you sick? - Don't harass her, Tajima. I'm not! I'm just concerned. Leave her alone. I'm here and I want you all to myself! And just leave Miho sitting there? It's fine, she isn't used to this work yet. Is that so? You're not used to the job yet, Miho? Not yet. Hurry up and get used to it, then! See, you're totally fine! You're okay! But you know, some men will do stuff like this! Tajima! Leave her alone! Miho, come back and sit down! Keep that up Tajima, and I'll throw you out! Alright already! But, she has to learn to deal with difficult situations! She doesn't need that! You were tense at first, too! But, I helped you relax every day! Yes, by feeling me up with your dirty hands every day. Why are you saying it like that? I'm not a creep! Keep it down or you won't be allowed back. Sorry about today. About what? That Tajima person was one of your regular customers, right? One less won't hurt. I have plenty of regulars, so I don't care. Thank you. It's not like I particularly protected you or anything. Not all guys are like him. Yes, not everyone is like him, right? Is that what you thought I would say? Listen, Miho. That kind of person is quite regular. People like him, who steals two lighters every time he comes. Most of the losers here get ripped off in Kabukicho. If just that bothers you, you won't last long. Really... You got felt up a little and started crying about it, how annoying. How old are you? I wasn't crying. You probably won't last long. You've really got it all together. Huh? Even though you're very young, you're very mature, Kanako. Is that so? Are you being sarcastic? No, I'm not. I'm home. Welcome back. Notice anything? What is it, did you make something? The shelf? Cool, right? I'm proud of my paint job. I gave it so many coats that I had to buy more paint. It got better with each coat, so I couldn't stop and- Sorry! What the heck? I knew I couldn't pull it off. But... It'll be okay if we open the door slowly. We can't just open it slowly, that's the toilet. It's no good. - I'll redo it! - Hey! Sei, did you write a song? Well, kind of... This is incredible! I want to hear it, Sei! It's not finished yet. Sei, you achieved so much today! I put the shelf in a bad spot, I'm really dumb. For that matter, the DIY shop was looking for casual workers. You've never lasted long at your part-time jobs. I'm pretty good with wood, though. Sei, you are a musician after all. You should be composing and performing. You should finish the song. When are you going to let me hear it? You will. Hey. When can I hear it? Forget about work. It's fine. I'm making more money now. - Miho! - Yes? Do you support your guy? Why? I can tell because I did as well! Wow, even though you're so young? That piece of trash cheated on me. But, I loved him and wanted him to look at only me. I did anything for him. Anything? In the end, I had enough of being his slave. It was too much for him, too. We both wanted to end it. Is your man okay? He's not that kind of guy at all. What's he like, then? He's a musician. And, he never goes out. That's perfect! Is it? He won't cheat on you if he stays home! I don't mind if he cheats as long as he properly makes music. Not me! I can handle an unemployed man, but not a cheater. Me too, I guess. But I'm glad, Miho. You've got this job and that hostess gig, right? Yes! Those daily payments made me cry! Is that why you were crying? Yes, I was just so happy. Don't pleasure yourself after you finish up. - Miho. - Yes? - Want to take a new customer? - Okay. He looks loaded, make sure he likes you. If he does, then he'll come back to see you. Then your pay will go up, Miho. Okay! I'm Miho. How old are you? 27, I mean 23. How old do you think I am? How old do I think you are? You just told me. Oops, I guess I did. Why are you working in a place like this? Huh? You seem out of place here. You can tell? I've only been here for a month so far. And what's happened in that month? Hostesses love to talk about themselves. A boring day job or because they love travelling. Or, because they like alcohol. My reason is ordinary. Ordinary? Ordinary... I just need the cash for living expenses. You spend so much that you need two jobs? No, I don't live a life of luxury, I work to cover for myself and another. I see. That's kind of rare these days. Most girls want money to use for themselves. I guess they do. If it's just for money, there are better options than this place. There are? How? Do you want me to tell you? I will. Yes. You're so serious. Don't tell your manager, okay? The door will now close. Come. Over there. In school, what club were you in? I was in the school band in high school. School band is no good... Stay still. Don't move. So, you didn't like physical education classes? Well, I liked swimming. Swimming? When did you do it? In elementary school. Change. Huh? Why? You want money, right? It's part of the job. Um... - Are we going to... - Yes? Have sex? Not that exactly. It's up to you, though. Let's see. I guess I'd call you a mistress. A mistress. It can be for only today, if you want. You can think over whether you want to meet again or not. Right. I thought at least for today, we'd just talk and get to know each other first. But that swimsuit, put it on for now. To make a decision, you need to know what's involved. Right? Okay then, I'll put it on for now. Just wearing it though won't get you enough money to make you happy, I think. After coming this far, are you really okay with that? Still thinking on it? Yes. For now, just put it on first. Right where you are. Huh? Right there. ♫ My grandfather's clock ♫ ♫ Was too large for the shelf ♫ ♫ So it stood ninety years on the floor ♫ ♫ It was taller by half than the old man himself ♫ ♫ Though it weighed not a pennyweight more ♫ ♫ It was bought on the morn of the day he was born ♫ ♫ And was always his treasure and pride, but it stopped short ♫ ♫ Never to go again when the old man died ♫ Welcome back. Did you hear it? - You should play that at a concert. Yeah, I guess so. It'd be good to perform live. You should just do it, really. At a gig. When will you do it? Whenever. Then hurry and do it. - I will. - No you won't! I will. No one can hear you singing softly in here. I've got to say... You've lost your edge, it's boring. We have to compromise if we want paying gigs. It's a product. - Right. - A product? I don't understand that part of you at all. She's the product, isn't she? You're just her stepping stone. She'll ditch you soon enough. You're delusional. Listen. In order for you guys to understand, I used words like "compromise" and "product". But the audience is getting bigger, so you've got to be happy about it. It's the label's marketing strategy. This guy is talking about strategy! He has the wrong idea about record labels. He's clueless. They're not trying to exploit and control us. I want to be so popular that they'd want to! And you'd do anything for that? Of course not, but we enjoy playing. Exactly. There were too many things we were fixed on in our past four-member band, right? That's all gone now. We're free now. We play better now, don't we? You just used to suck, that's all. Really? Should I shave? Definitely. You have a problem with the vocals? The hottie? You think that's going to attract people? That's not exactly it. I mean, she will attract men, but... Girls love my mustache. You should just shave it off. But how is her singing? She's okay. Right? Yeah. She might be okay. So you admit it, that's good. But you know, your old fans could feel betrayed. It's like you sold your soul to a woman. They'll think that you've been corrupted. What? What do you mean by that? Forget about it. Loosen up! You're the one who's corrupt! Take it easy. Sei, take that back. We're not here to fight. He's being a brat. Hey. I'm not. You're 27, aren't you? That has nothing to do with this. It doesn't, but... Try saying something age-appropriate for once. - What? - He's full of himself. - Lay off. Can I go already? - Stay. - Enough! Let me talk. What is it? Sei. We wanted you back, so we called you here. What? So, we w anted to discuss if there was a way for us to get back together. The label you hate suggested it. And also Naomi! I played her some of your songs. She was impressed and wanted to sing with you. I avoided telling her why you quit the band. The truth is that she looks up to you. But it's too late now. Well... I hope you know we care about you. Okay? We respect your opinions. It's too bad that we couldn't resolve things today. Excuse me, check please! Right away! Thank you! - It's on us. - No way. - It's fine. - Don't worry about it. It's okay. What a bother! You don't work so that's probably money from your girl. Keep it. I'll pay you back some time then. Is she okay with that? - You're too proud to work - Stop it. - and your music is in a rut. Then you act all superior. That's right, all you've got is your big talk. What does your woman think of you? Ask her yourself. - See you. - What's with that attitude? Just let it go. Stop it. Let's play golf again. Oh, Macao? I'm into trekking recently. I'm back home. What are you doing? I could get about 30,000 yen for these, don't you think? Maybe not? You're going to sell them? Well... I don't need them anymore and they take up space. Wait a minute. Huh? Why do you treat such important things to you as a hindrance? I told you I would work for us. So you can just write songs, Sei. I told you that you don't have to worry about money, so why sell them? Because I won't use them. I mean, I really only need my guitar. Can I part with this? - Hey, Sei. - What? - What did you do today? - Huh? What did you do today!? Today? What did you do while I was gone? You didn't do anything, right? I was working, you know! - Well... - Even then, Sei, you... I didn't do nothing. I'm making money. - What? - I got these ready. They'll make 30,000 yen. 30,000? 30,000? Here's your 30,000 then. I'll buy them, then. It's from Hong Kong. I'm in a rush, so I'll head out first. I'll contact you again later. I wish you were chubbier. See you. I'm home. You've been cleaning? It took me the whole day. I wish you'd just write some songs instead! Got any cigarettes? I do. No! What's this? 30,000. 20,000. Is it such dangerous money that you'd be surprised I found it? What have you been up to? Why are you upset? Huh? I made that money for you! I earned that for you! Even then, this much is just too abnormal! - I received it. - From who? A rich old guy. What? That's my job. You mean... You're having sex with other men? That's what I do! I'm a mistress. Do you think I could live off of that kind of money? That kind of money? It's all for your sake! Why is it for my sake!? It's all for your music! If I don't make money for it, you won't get anywhere! My music... For me... you... Don't do something so stupid and use me as an excuse! You're the one who's making the excuses. I've been making so many sacrifices and attending to your needs every day, all for your music! Sei, I'm sorry... Huh? Is that you, Sei? Oh, hey. What are you doing? You want to work? Maybe our relationship has ended. But we had nowhere else to go. We only had each other. What's with all this fruit? Hey! You didn't steal it, right? Tell me already, Sei! I threw that money away! Hey, where were you? Answer me! What are you thinking? No... I found a job. - I have to pee. - Again? Thank you. - Excuse me, give me a beer. - Okay. Make that an oolong cocktail, actually. Okay. Here you go. I thought my heart would stop. I hadn't seen Hagio in ages. My trembling legs nearly gave away. But, I could think clearly and talk, as strange as that was. Hagio! Woah! Huh? What? It's been ages, hasn't it? Yeah, it really has been! What is it? Were you watching just now? No, I work here. Really? Here? I sure messed up then! - You really didn't want to see me? - Of course not! No, not really. I'm just kidding! Did you change your number? I couldn't contact you at all. Oh, you called me? When? I forgot. Pull out your phone, I'll register your number. I left it. - Where? - Over there. Oh well then, maybe next time. Wait, I'll be right back. I'll grab it real fast. I'm going to go already. No! Please come with me for a bit! I'll tell you my number, so memorize it. Hagio! Hagio. Haio! Hagio! Wait for me! It's the last train. Sorry... - Want to get a drink? - Yes. - I have no cash. - It's fine. I'm pretty sure that hotel would be booked out. Who talked about a hotel? Won't your man know? About what? That you're with a guy. So? You've changed. What kind of woman was I? I don't really remember, but... But you were in love with me. I didn't really like you that much, though. Were you in love? Yes, I was. It was too much for me. It wasn't much fun to be with you at all back then. It is now, though. If it had been this good back then... What? Well, we might have been dating. It's all in the past though. - Hagio? - What? I love you. I know. - Do you really? - Yes. Hagio... What... What am I doing? What am I doing? I don't even know what I'm doing. I... Don't know. You didn't forget about me? - You forgot about me? - No. Someone might come... No one will. It's like the first time. That's because you forgot about me, right? Hagio. I was... Pregnant with your baby. Did you abort it? Yes. For you. Did we screw that much? Many times! You really forgot! You really have changed. No, I haven't changed at all. I've always loved you, Hagio. The way you keep telling me you love me hasn't changed. Hagio, how about you? - Do you love me now? - Yeah. I'm home. What am I... What am I doing? What am I doing? I don't even know. I... don't know. Seiichi, would you do it? If it's three days a week. Really? It can get very busy. I'm free at night. But don't you have to get up early? It's not about being early. This place closes at 4 in the morning, though. That's fine, I'll go directly to the delivery job then. Then when are you going to sleep? I'll get about two hours to sleep after that in the evening. Are you serious? Why do you want to do part-time jobs that much? Wouldn't it be better to get a full time job? I've done bartending before. Are we really doing it? I've brought someone with me. It's you! I can't drink, I have work after this. Work? I can deliver you some lemons and limes. You've changed. I thought you'd have a European car. See, you're delusional. We only get paid after the album's out. Terao works at a car rental place. Kawauchi is back lazing around at home. And that guy even mocked me! How about you? Don't you get it? This is how it is. Is it hard juggling both this place and that? Do you want me to look after this place for you? Yeah, right. Seriously, I have plenty of time. Terao still says that he wants you back. Why? - Remember what he said? - Yeah. How about the hot vocalist? Naomi, you and the three of us. You'd hate that. I hate this more! I asked for a girl to help with the bar. Who's that? It's Naomi. Ooh. [Alright! When is good?] [How about tomorrow?] Oh, welcome back! - Curry? - Yeah. I mean it's meat and potato stew. It'll be done soon. What's wrong? What? You're going already? Shouldn't you sleep a little bit? Someone's waiting for me. [I'm busy tomorrow. How about today?] - Will you be my girl? - What? Just that, nothing more. - You already have a girlfriend, don't you? - I don't. I mean, there are girls... Not as many as I had in the past and they mean nothing to me. But I can't break up with Sei. Don't you have more fun with me? I hardly even see him of late. Then you should pick me. I know you're more fun, Hagio. Then pick me. How about it? Come to my place. Will you stay with me forever? Will you love me even after your lives become routine? That's a big question to answer, but I'll love you while it's still fun. What I want to hear is not about how you think, Hagio. It's not that deep, but... Can I borrow about 10,000 yen? I knew it. Everything's skin deep with you. What do you mean by that? Am I being dumped by you already? That look so delicious! Ah, I'm fine. Please give me some! Thank you! - It's so great! - Really? I'm happy to hear that! Thank you. It's really good. Delicious! I made too much food. This one isn't that great. - I'll put it away for now. - I'll eat it, I'll eat it! No, no. You don't have to force yourself! No, but... Okay then, go ahead. Watch your step. We can tell them we went fishing. I'll catch you! Yeah. Watch your step. This is my hotel. Ah! This is my family's van. I thought he liked Naomi. Just between us... Naomi turned down Tanaka twice already. Don't tell anyone I said that. Sei, what do you think about Naomi? Wanna hook up? You can do it. You don't want to? I don't. I want you to. Terao's been acting weird. My van has plenty of seats, yet he rented a car. He's going to take her. He's planning on taking Naomi home. Is he? He is. Do me a favor... No, wait. I have my part-time job tonight. Why? Why don't you take a nap? Well, I mean, rather than a nap... - A nap... - Why? I just want you to stay in the car until we leave. It's for Naomi's sake. Everyone's saying that we're leaving soon. Can I go to your bar when you're working? Sure. Anytime. I saw the DVD. You did? What did you think? It was really hot. I had a zit on my butt! A zit... I'll watch it again and look for it. No! Don't look for it. Well then, I'm going to go back by train. See you. ♫ But... But... But... ♫ ♫ I used to be a king ♫ ♫ I was passing time at my grand castle ♫ ♫ If I needed a ride ♫ ♫ I'd call on my big dragon, ♫ ♫ Falkon! ♫ ♫ I'm okay with adventures ♫ ♫ Leave it to me ♫ ♫ I can handle any adversaries ♫ Why's there percussion there? And the strings earlier. It's like you're trying too hard. What do you think? I know what you mean. Lose it. They want our debut single to have impact, though. You get that. No. Naomi likes it. No way! Her vocals sound detached because of that. The chorus isn't working. It's confusing. Alright. It won't sell. - We'll work on it. - There's no point. That's your opinion. You don't know if it will sell or not. It definitely won't sell. It has to, or we'll be in a pinch. It really won't sell. - Shut up! - There's no way this will sell! Okay... - It won't sell. - Okay... ♫ If you're going to cook ♫ Of course he loves you while it's fun. That's obvious. But that sounds shallow, doesn't it? He sounds so arrogant. What's so good about that guy? That elusiveness of his seemed so cool back then. Back then, right? You just want to fulfill your old fantasy, don't you? Maybe you're right. But what if I love him despite knowing he's that kind of guy? Just because he's that kind of guy, I can't just simply come to despise him. If you really liked him, what would you do? That's not the right question. Your problem is that you can't choose between the two of them, right? - It's so hard! - You're better off ditching them both. Both... Otherwise, you'll always think of the one you didn't choose. You'd hate that, right? It would be easier if Sei left me. How about the other guy? It's fine, Hagio will absolutely leave at some point. Is it okay to park this here? I don't know. It seems fine. Hey, are you really coming up? Wait! - Hi, good evening. - Good evening. - This is Kanako. - Hello. You finished this? Should I leave? No, it's okay. You sure? A Chu-Hi... Should I leave? No way. Okay. I know him. That's Mr. Hagino, right? - How do you know him? - I met him once. He won't remember. But, he dated my friend. He worked a club in Ikejiri. That was ages ago. How old were you, Kanako? 16, maybe 17. Did he misbehave or do something? I'm okay, but friend ended up quitting school. We should probably wake him up soon. This is Sei. That's Kanako. Hi, sorry to intrude! Nice to meet you. And that's... Hagio? Hagio. Oh, um, that's Hagio. He's fast asleep. Is he sleeping? - He is, totally! - That's amazing. - Yeah! - He's really fast asleep. - Um, sorry, I'm going to leave now. Hagio, hurry and wake up! We're going hom! It's fine, there's no rush. Sei has his part-time job soon. Even now, I'm working. - Oh, hello. - Hi. Hagio, let's go! Is it morning? The trains are already running. You can take your time, it's fine. - I'm going to take a shower and leave soon. - Cool. Shut up and come already! How about a shower? - Cool. - Do you know your way? I'll figure it out. Cough drops, there are none! Bye. Be careful! - Sorry, it's like I kicked them out. - It's okay. Okay... For the bar. [PAVIETON] Hey, Sei. - Sei? - Huh? Why is there a girl? That's the new singer. Why? I don't want this girl singing in the band! She's pretty good at singing. But those are songs that you wrote, Sei! IT's okay. I'm just helping them. If you're helping them, you should sing! Why aren't you singing? You're so stupid! What? Even if you're fine with it, I'm not! I was waiting... I was waiting for you to sing for me some day! What about me? Listen... What? I'll move out soon. Let's live separately. What are you saying all of a sudden? It's not sudden at all. Since when have you been thinking that? Since I've seen how much you've changed. You never look at me! Well, rather... I've been thinking. You're better off without me. Find a decent man. Then have kids. That'd be best for you. Have a happy life as a normal woman. You won't have to force yourself to do things anymore. Find a man who gives you security. Where is such a man? Is there such a man? I didn't need a decent man. How did we get like this? Is my scooter still there? Yes, it is. Do you like it here? No, it's just because it's cheap. And, you live close. Too close. What about your man? He left. We broke up. - When? - A while ago. Well then... We don't have to sneak around anymore, right? You never did in the first place. Oh yeah... I went back with Kanako, right? Did she tell you what happened after that? What? We took a taxi back to her place. You didn't hear? And? I stayed over. And? I stayed over for about three days. Really? I didn't hear. I'm just kidding! I'm getting more and more scared of showing my true self to you. I'm afraid you'll get bored of me and leave, it's scary. - One more beer. - Okay. So, let's not see each other anymore. If you want... Cancel my beer then, please. But, I often walk around here. So, we might bump into each other somewhere. Whoever sees the other one first should avoid the them. I'll hide. You, hide? I'm not good at hiding. Yes, I'll hide. You won't. You'll run after me calling out, "Hagio!" "Hagio! Hagio!" Right? I don't want to repeat the same thing again. Give me that beer after all. Okay. I'm going that way. I'm going the other way. See you. Hagio! Thank you. Let's hear the vocals next. Please. I'll do the chorus later. Isn't this weird? I know. Sei told me to lose the chorus. I hope many people come. Lots of tickets sold. That's good. Let's go eat. How can you eat? You feeling queasy? You don't have to come. Is Sei coming today? He can't, he's tending the bar. He should have closed it for today! I told him that it was fine, but... It's okay. He'd just complain anyway. Let's go eat. Okay? I'll carry the gear then. - Please do. - Good job. Are you okay? Huh? It's been a while. Did they rehearse? Yea, but they went out to eat. They can seriously eat before a live performance? They looked pretty nervous, though. For that matter, what about the bar? It's closed. I haven't opened it since yesterday. It's not my bar. How's life lately? I'm back home. My brother and his wife moved out, so there was an empty room. Right. I wrote a song. Want to listen? Is that why you came? I didn't write it for you. Is it okay for me to hear it? There's no deep meaning behind this. Just listen lightly. This is good. They won't use all this gear, yet they bring it all. You really all do get along well. Well, more than before anyway. That'll do. ♫ Across the road there is a cat ♫ ♫ It's facing towards the river ♫ ♫ Across the river, there's a mountain ♫ ♫ In the mountain, what can we find? ♫ ♫ There's someone, someone lost and lonely ♫ ♫ There's someone, someone lost and lonely ♫ ♫ If you have a guitar, sing a song.

So cute and beautiful. I cried.
