(drumbeat music) - Hey Sarg Sarg, I hate to tell ya this - You're kiddin me. - Yeah I am. I'm buying the beer. - Come on we're gonna be late for the briefing. (engine sounds) (drumbeat music) - Well guys, I guess we can relax now. Whatever's coming down can't be too hurry we let these assholes in on it. - Screw you Maddox. - Hey that's Sergeant Maddox to you, Corporal. - Right, right, right. Screw you, Sergeant Maddox. - One of these days somebody's gonna have to teach your boy here, Billy the fucking Kid, some manners. - Ain't gonna be me. - So who's it gonna be? - Don't push your luck, candy ass. - [Johnny's Partner] Hey, easy Johnny, come on, easy. - Do I detect some tension in the air? - No sir. - None here. - Okay okay, let's cut out the crap. Get down to business. Intelligence informs us there's to be a meeting between North Vietnamese officer, a certain Colonel Trang, and a top VC controller tomorrow, sector six. Here, above the playcoup mountain range. Trang is coming in by train, carrying instructions for a strategic strike on hamlets in sector six. Men, we want that train hit and Trang terminated with extreme prejudice. Captain Carter will give you the details. - Alright gentlemen, let's gather around. I'll be flying you up to your target areas where one Sergeant Maddox and the Condor team will take up positions near the railroad tracks here at point A. Two, Sergeant Stratton and the Eagle team we'll take a little farther on up the tracks here point B. Three, Eagle team boards a passing train, takes out Trang. By the time the train passes point A, the Condor team boards the engine and takes out the engineer. Four, as Eagle team moves forward, Condor team leaves down cover fire, prepares to disconnect the engine when the Eagle arrives. Five, you'll take the train, stop it on the bridge over the River Guitawquan and I'll be there to pick y'all up. Any questions? Alright, we leave at twenty-one hundred hours. See y'all then. Good luck. Gentlemen, meet Colonel Trang, your target. (helicopter sounds) - I guess it's time to drop boys. - Alright, listen up. We're not sure which cab Trang's gonna be in so I want both of you to take one last look at our target. Now, if he's in the cab assigned to you, make damn sure you get him. Alright, let's get ready. (helicopter sounds) (drumbeat music) (helicopter sounds) - Okay Stratton, we'll do our part. Just make sure you do yours. - He's gone. Good luck. - Oh what the hell. Likewise.

Train never stopped. - [Man Sitting] Captain has his point. That was the plan. - So what the hell happened to Condor? - VC patrol got in his way. He had to abort. But you guys did one hell of a good job. And I'll see that you get proper recommendation. - You can keep the medals. (slapping sound) let's go clean up and get some beers. (slamming door) (upbeat music) (mumbling) - Beer man, bunch a beer huh? Make sure it's cold. - Good to see you guys made it back. - No thanks to you buddy. - Can it Johnny. - Come on over, join the boys. Beers on me. - Well, well now look who's here. Welcome back fly boys. Have fun in the bush? - Lay off Biller. They got the job done. - And us fools we're gonna hear all about it. - Look buddy, you put the mission and the lives of my men in jeopardy. You had orders and you failed to carry them out. - We were taking flack from an exposed position. What the hell could we do? Took cover. - Just like the last time. You guys don't like much being in the fire zone do ya? - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Means you're chicken shit! - Come on Johnny. We'll take our drinks over there. Dirty spot over here. - That's because of you, you stinkin little gook. (punching sounds) (kicking sounds) (crashing sounds) (kicking sounds) (rattling sounds) (punching sounds) (kicking sounds) - Alright, break it up! - Morning gentlemen, y'all had a good night's sleep I trust. Since you pissed the colonel off a little bit last night it's going on your records. - We were just blowing off at his steam captain. Sergeant Maddox isn't to blame and I'll take full responsibility on this. - Yeah but just try to contain yourself from now on we're not here to fight each other. (camera shutter sound) - So my little pothead, there really is a lost command. Does the military know about them? - The military not sure. - We got proof now. - [Man] This man, bad. Come on please. We go now. - Wait pot, wait. I need to get closer. I need a little bit more detail. Come on. (camera shutter sound) - If it ain't tweedle dum and tweedle dee. - Hey. - Let's take a hike. - BL's gonna love this. (punching sound) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (gun bangs) - What the hell is going on? - Gun shots over there. - Let's go. Jackson, Louis, get your ass out here. (suspenseful music) (engine sounds) (gun bangs) - Let's go we got trouble. - What? - We got some white broad taking pictures of the camp. She was with some little monteniach. We were bringing them in but they got away. - Well she's not gonna get away. We'll get the bitch and her camera. Now let's go. Get going. - Alright. - Let's go, let's go get the truck. Let's go. (engine sounds) Hurry up! (engine sounds) (upbeat music) (engine sounds) (gun bangs) - Hit 'em with the rocket. (exploding sounds) - Come on. (gun sounds) - Hey come on run. (engine sounds) - Hurry up let's go right there. Let's go. (gun bangs) (yelling) - [Group] Attack! (gun bangs) (groans) (gun bangs) (exploding sound) - Retreat! (exploding sound) - There's no place to run, there's no place to hide! Let's go! (laughing) (gun bangs) (groans) (gun bangs) (banging sound) - Move it dammit. Get into your position. You here. Get going. - Chet, they're right behind me. - Who's they? - Last command. - Vietcong you mean. - Let's call ??? - Do it. - Fortress come in. This is camp four. We need help. Repeat, we need help. (explosion sound) (suspensful music) (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (groans) - Radio man, radio man. Give me the horn. Zebra one, this is alpha tango. We've been overrun. I repeat, we've been overrun. The enemy's taken over the village. Friendly forces North, Northeast of your position. (helicopter sounds) (gun bangs) (explosion sounds) (helicopter sounds) (upbeat music) (explosion sounds) (missile sounds) (explosion sounds) (helicopter sounds) (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (helicopter sounds) - They're on the run. They're all over the place. - Hey you alright, Miss? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Alright, Billy come on. - I'm fine. - Let's go! Let's go! (gun bangs) - Johnny, secure the area. Pull it to me. - Predator! You guys check those fucking hooches. Predator! (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (suspenseful music) - Are you alright, sarg? - Yeah Johnny. - The last command is not a myth colonel. I was there. - If you got proof, let's see it. - I had the whole thing. The whole thing. Then it got wasted. - It was the VC they attacked that village. - Bullshit. They were GI issue right down to their fucking M16's. - I appreciate your enthusiasm and I'm quite sure you're a fine reporter, but I assure you there's no story here. - Well, maybe it's just one you don't wanna admit to. You know, I can always go back and get more pictures. - Miss chandler, miss chandler, your safety here is my personal responsibility. And quite frankly, your presence in my area of command is a pain in the ass. Captain, see to it that Miss Chandler is confined to the base until the next dispatched chopper leaves for Saigon. - The general's gonna hear about this. - I'm sure he will. - Johnny, how's he doing? - The doc says he's gonna be out of action for a while. - But he's gonna pull through. - Thank God. I'm in enough shit as it is. I'm sorry. I feel like it's all my fault. - Don't be ridiculous. These things happen. It's all in the line of duty, Miss Chandler. - Chris. - Rick, Chris. - Have you been to see the colonel yet ma'am? - Nope, I'm just on my way. - You know we've all heard stories about your so-called lost command. - So-called? - Well, you've got to admit this whole thing seems a little bit farfetched. - Well, uh... - Ain't that right, sarg? - Yeah that's right Johnny. But then again this whole damn war seems farfetched. - It does at that. (helicopter sounds) (yelling and cheering) - What are you doing here dickhead? - Why the fuck did you hit that village? - Oh captain, didn't anybody ever tell you that I'm the general around here man. (laughing) - Without me, you're nothing. You order the lost command. - She was a fucking reporter. She went into the God damned village, you asshole. You know she's a reporter, she's got cameras, she's got film, I didn't know she was gonna go in the village but I went in there to get the God damn camera, you got that? - Okay. Okay. We got three vehicles. Three kill zones. Block here. Block here. Payroll's in the middle. - Payroll means payday! - And payday means pussy! - Right! - Another couple weeks oughta do it, you heal fast sergeant. - Not fast enough to suit me. - Don't push it, you're doing fine. No strenuous activity for a while understand. - Okay. - Give nature time to take it's course. - Thanks doc. - I'll check in on you in a couple days. - How bout a second opinion? - Hi Chris. - Hi. - To what do I owe this pleasure? - I gotta talk to you. - Fire away. - Remember sergeant, nothing strenuous. - Alright. - I've been here a week. Three dispatched helicopters to Saigon and I couldn't have gone. Carter's keeping me grounded here and I know damn well why. He's afraid someone in command just might believe me. - I believe you Chris. - You believe me about the lost command? - I wasn't sure until I went to pull you out of that village. - Did you see him? - No only Radner. - Who? - Sergeant BL Radner. He used to be part of my squad. - What? I don't understand. - It's a long story. - [MP Outside] Radner, you're completely surrounded. Give up before somebody gets hurt. - Come on up we'll talk about it. - Alright I'm coming in. - Leave your weapon in the Jeep. - [Stratten] About 18 months ago in Denange, a bunch of black marketeers were cornered by the MP's in a warehouse. Turned out Ratner was the head of that synakit. I arrived just as he suckered the commanding officer into the warehouse. Radner took him hostage. The officer was my brother, Mike. - Alright you assholes, I got your God damn C.O. I'm gonna blow his fucking head off unless you stop playing soldier and leave us alone. Now back off. - Ratner this is Rick. You guys are outnumbered and outgunned, so don't make things worse for yourself. - Stay out of it Stratten. It ain't none of your damn business. - B.L. we can help you out of this. - You wanna help? Just stay the fuck out of it. Otherwise, I'm gonna waste your smartmouthed brother here. (punching sound) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) - I can handle this Sarg. - Bring me back his balls, Johnny. (gun bangs) (suspenseful music) I looked everywhere for the bastard but he just seemed to have disappeared. I thought that was the last time I'd ever run into him. Figured the band disbanded and hid out in Louse or something. But I told myself I wouldn't give up until Radner was either dead or behind bars. Now I figure it might have been the birth of the lost command. - Now you're talking. - Chris how many men did you see in that camp? - God, couldn't be sure but I'd say at least 30. - That'd account for quite a few awols and MIA's. - How come you haven't told Slark yet? - He wouldn't make a move without proof. - What about you? - Couple more days I'll be ready. - I can take you to their camp. - Not on your life. You can tell me how to get there though. But when I go, if I go, I go with the Eagle team and no one else. Is that understood? - Ah something tells me it's gonna be a long day man. Visional payroll's going out at 0800 hours. It's a big one man, it contains all the departmental payments to all those hill tribes. We're gonna ride shotgun up as far as Mac low. Sarg is still laid back, man, that fucking Maddox is in charge. - Shit. I had a day pass hoping to see my wife and kid. - Hey Ransom get your ass in here, you're coming with me. - Don't worry man, alright. I'll be back before you know it. (engine sounds) come on let's go. - Come on. - Boys are ready to go. (clapping sound) - Yeah, it's payroll time. (engine sounds) (exploding sounds) (gun bangs) (exploding sounds) (squealing brake sound) (exploding sound) (gun bangs) (exploding sound) (gun bangs) (exploding sound) (gun bangs) (exploding sounds) (gun bangs) - Come on, let's clean out, let's clean out let's go. (cheering) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) - ??? Get the fuck out of here. (gun bangs) - Let's go, come on hurry up, move it come on let's go. You must be slipping there Johnny boy. - B.O. - Decided to pay us a little visit huh? Well we got a lot of catching up to do. Let's move out. (clapping) - That's the end of this conversation, davis so let me be. - Come on carter, you can't leave the issue hanging like that. All I want is a simple yes or no. - Watch my lips, no, there is no God damn lost command. - Why can't you accept the fact that many of the men listed as AWOL have banded together to form bushwacking armies. - You know it's not Charlie who is the enemy out there. It's war correspondents like you and dinky doll politicians who are fucking up our lives. If there are disgruntled boys out there, and remember i said if, then I sympathize with those mothas. How the hell do you think some boy feels sitting out in the bush spilling his guts knowing there's no God damn reason or rhyme for the firefight he's just been in because we're not supposed to win this here war. - Can I quote you on that? - Word for word, now get the hell outta here. (engine sounds) - Y'all just stand by and let the medics do the job. - I'm afraid he's lost too much blood. - Why in the hell wasn't he given blood in Mac low? There was no reason to bring him back to base. - Snafoo in communications. A little bit of confusion cause of the ambush over at mac low. - Willy, can you hear me? Who hit the payroll convoy? (breathing heavy) - Damage, what damage? No VC. White man. White ??? Miss Chris is right all the time. Miss Chris is right. (breathing heavy) - There it is captain. - Bullshit. He was incoherent and incomprehensible. - (gasping) - And I'm denying you permission. You're in no condition to return to the field yet sergeant and I suggest you return to your billet and remain there until the medical officer gives me a report that clears you for active duty. - My ass. - So, together again just like old times huh Johnny boy? You and me and Stratten, nobody fucked with that eagle team did they? We were real tough weren't we? Well the eagle has crash landed. Never to fly again. Johnny boy. - What's happened to you B.O.? What the fuck do you want? - What do I want? What do I want? I think I've been overcome by a powerful case of nostalgia. Yep. Yeah, now what I want is to go back down memory lane. Go back to when you assholes were sticking your nose in our warehouse operation. That's where I'd like to go back to. It was you guys that made me do that. It was your fault that that dumb shit brother of Stratten's got killed that day. You just shoulda stayed out of it. Boy it's rotten. And it stinks. Yeah and there's something else I forgot to tell ya. I'm real sorry but I had to waste that hero Rick. Just the other day I had to blow him away. Real sorry about that. That's war ain't it kid? - I hate to disappoint you B.O. But he didn't die man. - Well, I guess that changes things a bit. You might just get yourself a couple extra days out of this Johnny boy. Relax, lay back, get yourself a suntan. Talk to you a little later. - Fuck you. (suspenseful music) (gun cocking sound) (gun bangs) (engine sounds) (camera shutter sound) - God dammit, Chris what the hell are you doing? - I'm a war correspondent for Christ' sake. I get paid to do this shit. - I oughta throw ya out of this Jeep right now. - I'm the only one who knows where their camp is, Rick. - This is my second tour of duty in these parts. I know my way around. - Yeah well there isn't time for that, is there? - Chris, do you have any idea what these guys'll do to you if you're captured? - I have no intentions of being captured. I'm gonna go in there, get my photos, and get the fuck out. I'll leave the heroics to you. Come on Rick. This is the biggest story I got going. I'll stay out of your way I promise. - Oh shit. - Come on big guy. Please.. - Well if you're gonna navigate, you might as well get up front. (engine sounds) (fire crackling) - Here you go, my man. Grade A hemp from Hanoi. Come on take a hit man. There ya go. (spitting sound) (hitting sound) (grunting sound) (coughing sound) - B.O. and you ain't never gonna get along unless you learn to take a more sociable attitude asshole. (hitting sound) (crowd cheering) - [Man In Crowd] Leave him alone, leave him alone. Ratner said not to touch him. (gun bangs) - Hit the fucker. (gun bangs) - [Man In Crowd] B.O. and you ain't never gonna get along unless you learn to take a more sociable attitude asshole. (cheering) - [Man In Crowd] Leave him alone. - They're only having a little fun with ya Johnny boy. (laughing) (engine sounds) (drum beat sounds) - Stratten and the girl are gone. - I figured as much. We got intelligence reports that there's a gang of misfits out there. She's probably gone after them. - God damn journalist. If she breaks the story, all holy hell is gonna break out in Washington and that shit is the sort of publicity you all don't need. - To hell with that. If they're out there, I want their hides. Briefing in 30 minutes. (engine sounds) - Hold it. Hold it. This is it. From that ridge over there you can see down into their camp. - Let's go. (drum beat sounds) - As you can see A company from 101st Armor division is already on the move. I'm putting you in full command of the assault. You'll be directing fire from the gun ship. I'm counting you to do a good job captain. Good luck captain. Get going. - [Crowd] (laughing and yelling) - Son of a bitch. - What are you gonna do? - Figure out some way to create a diversion. Then go and get Johnny out. - [Crowd] (cheering) (helicopter sounds) - Chopper, take cover. (camera shutter sounds) (helicopter sounds) - (chanting) Scag, scag, scag, - [Crowd] scag, scag, scag, scag, scag, scag - Well, if it isn't the big man himself. Hope you didn't forget our smack man. - Cut the bullshit, Radner. You don't have much time. They're coming for ya. - Who the fuck's they? - The game's up. Your camp's been pinpointed, command's called in a strike. You got about 30 minutes before you and the scumbags are blown off this map. So I suggest you and the boys start humping it if you want to save your ass and the loot. - For a good share no doubt. - That was the deal if you all remember. - Yeah whatever you say captain. Whatever you say. - What in the hell is going on? - I don't know but they're up to something that's for damn sure. I'm going down. Now you stay put. This could get messy. (camera shutter sounds) (helicopter sounds) - Thank you sergeant. That'll be all. - Oh shit. I thought we had a deal. - Nah, I guess not. - [Man With Sunglasses] Drop it captain or I'll cut ya in two. - Better listen to him captain. Old Weasel's got this thing about officers. He wants to kill every fucking one of 'em. (laughing) (explosion sounds) Get outta here, what are ya doing? Get outta the camp! (explosion sounds) (helicopter sounds) (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (explosion sound) Ah I gotcha didn't I? You're dead mother fucker. You're gone! (explosion sounds) (explosion sounds) (camera shutter sounds) (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (clicking sound) (gun bangs) (explosion sounds) - Hey Johnny it's Rick. - Sarg. - You okay kid? - Yeah man they beat the shit outta me though. - Hope you feel better than ya look. - I don't. - Come on let's get the hell outta here. (explosion sounds) (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) - I need a gun sarg! - Well there it is Johnny. You're... (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (grunts) (gun bangs) - Shit they're everywhere. - Shit. - Throw the gun. (gun bangs) Johnny... (Explosion sounds and gun bangs) Johnny, I'm going after Radner. You gonna be okay? (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (explosion sounds) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (cocking sound) - Let's see who jumps now. (clicking sound) Go for your gun buddy. (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) - It's almost over Stratten. You're just about ready to join your brother. (gun bangs) trying to play a little game with me huh Stratten? (gun bangs) (clicking sounds) (laughing) - Looks like you win B.O. - Sure looks that way don't it. - What happened to you man? We used to be friends. - I only need one friend out here. - Yeah, firing up that's some friend huh. - Well that's all I need. I like it. - Yeah well it's turned you into a fucking animal. - Well you gotta be an animal to survive in this pit. - Yeah well right now it's just you and me in this pit. - (moaning) (camera shutter sounds) - Have you seen the sergeant? (camera shutter sounds) - Let's go home Johnny. - You okay? - Yeah. What a week this has been. - Yeah and you got two more years of this shit. - Thanks for cheering me up guy. - Yeah come on man I'll buy you a beer.
