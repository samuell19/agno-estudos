(LANGUID MUSIC) (MUSIC GETS FASTER) Go to the top, mate. Woo-hoo! We playing poker? You air force pussy boys want to play for cash? I can't even deal myself a good hand. - Bets? - I don't have any more. Say 'check' then. Check. OK. I'll check too then. Show us your cards, Mikey. Pair of queens. Full house. - Let's just call me moneybags! - Look at all that moolah, man! Give it back, man. I need it. It's not my money. I've got to get Mum's prescription on the way home. Shouldn't gamble if you can't afford to lose it, Mikey. Don't be a deadshit. Give it back. You know his mum's sick. She needs her pills. You've still got the rest of the money. OK. I'll give you your 10 bucks back. If you jump. I... I can't do that, man. I'm.. .I'm... I'm afraid of heights and the rocks always move. You'll be fine, bro. Three steps. We checked it out. Just give me the fucking money, man. YOUTH: What fucking money? Any money around here belongs to me. Cough it up. What are you playing? 52 pickup? Piss off, Victor. Hey, Paul. Tell your brother Jake won that money fair and square. Shut your mouth, septic. I'll bash you just for fun. You got any money? We could play a hand. - Two. - Two. Three. Three. GIRL: Alright. Show your cards. Pair of aces. What have you got? Three nines. Let's go, boys. I can't lose! (SHOUTING) - Go! - Shit! - Fuck! - Three steps, boys! Foley! I'll fucking catch you! I will fight you, Foley! Fuck! ♪ We will fight another day ♪ Hoorah, hoo-ri-ay We will fight another day ♪ Hoorah, hoo-ri-ay We'll fight another day. ♪ Fuck! - Mikey, here's your tenner. - For what? You jumped! Nah, mate. I nicked it. (TENSE MUSIC) (DIALOGUE MUTED) I'm at the gallery. No, no. Just drop something off for me. Excuse me. Something I haven't driven. OK? Alright. Yeah. Sorry? No, um, sorry, this is gonna sound really odd but I want to paint you. I took these shots of you in the gallery. And I really am sorry. I just saw the way you were looking at the art and there was just something in the way you were taking it in. Can I buy you a coffee or something? Can we talk? I don't want a coffee, no. - Do you know what the Archibald is? - It's a portrait prize, yeah? - Yeah. I want to paint you for that but technically we've got to spend a bit of time together. Thing is, there's this form that needs to be signed and I don't have it but maybe you could just say, "Allira Morley has permission to paint my portrait." You just have to say your name. The competition's not for six months so I've got plenty of time. Allira Morley has permission to paint my portrait. OK, I'm gonna go that way. - Not yet. You've got to say your name. Jake Foley. Could you maybe say your age and what you do? Is that OK? I'm 57. And I'm a gambler. Is that for real? - You're a gambler? - Yeah. Like on sports? Horses, greyhounds, that kind of thing? No. I play poker. Right on! Well, thanks. Maybe if I make the short list, I'll see you at the exhibition? No, you won't. JAKE: (VOICE OVER) An object won't change its motion unless a force acts on it. That's one of Newton's laws. From the time we were teenagers, Mikey, Alex, Paul, Drew and I were an inseparable band of pirates. But for quite a while now, life and circumstance have been pulling us apart and time is running out to apply the force that would bring us back together. Of all the boys, my best friend was Drew. We had a lot in common. Our dads were air force pilots. We liked to take risks and we both loved card games, specifically poker. Five-card draw, seven-card stud, Texas hold 'em, Omaha, Razz, Badugi, Chinese, deuce to seven triple-draw. Any kind of poker. When the first personal computers came along, we were all over it, adapting them to suit us, writing our own programs for the games we wanted to play, and in '94 we set up the world's first online poker system. When the larger markets opened to us that was a waterfall. More money than we'd ever dreamed of. Then Drew hit on something else. By restructuring the code from cards to countries, he retooled the program into a saleable, military grade surveillance software. We called it RIFFLE. Shit name, I know. Our customers are governments. But life's just a game, right? It's all in how you read and respond to your opponents. You watch how they bet, how much they bet. Everything they do informs you more. If luck is leaving you apply what you can to change its motion. Hey. I'm Jake. Keep walking. Maximise your wins, minimise your losses and stay in the game as long as you can. I'm Paje. - You can call me Bill. - Jake. Yeah. Did you bring something else to wear? - Yeah. - Yeah. This is your space. Join me outside. The medicine is telling me you're not ready yet so we wait. We can talk if you want. I'll talk then. Most people come here for the shared experience, safety in numbers. A shared journey. There are only three types of people who come here for a private appointment. There's the morbidly famous who are afraid of their own shadow. The drug fucked who quite mistakenly think this is the next great high. And the incurably curious. Now I don't recognise your face. You don't appear to be in need. But there is a weight on you. And... ..it's related to your mortality. How am I doing so far? 100%. Death is inevitable. All living things will die. You have to recognise that with relief. Embrace that knowledge. In my entire life... ..the time I've spent pondering my own mortality would add up to minutes. If that. Maybe when my wife, Alison, died I did ask the universe a lot of questions then. I never got any satisfactory answers. The answers don't always have the structure we expect. Sometimes the insistence of the question can drown out the response. Let's go and untie some knots. (ETHEREAL MUSIC) PAJE'S VOICE: Let's go and untie some knots. Over the next few days, there will always be somebody here with you. Over the next few days there will always be someone here with you for what comes out of your mouth. Sometimes the body wants to purge. The orange bucket is for what comes out of your mouth. The brown bucket... Pretty obvious, right? You will know when it's started. (WHISTLES) Project the quest for your quest to the front of your mind. You will know when it's time. (SLOW HARMONICA MUSIC) (MUSIC CONTINUES OVER DIALOGUE) Opening up to yourself is one thing. Opening up to others may still be hard. When the time's right you might be able to use this. What is it? Let's just call it truth serum. Couple of drops and you'll say what's on your mind. Perfectly harmless in small doses. Bit of sweating. It can unlock doors. It would take 10mls or more, directly injected, to be lethal. Some people take comfort in knowing that they have some means of control. (PUNCHING SOUNDS) MAN: OK, straight. - (WOMAN GRUNTS) MAN: Twenty. Go. - (WOMAN YELLS) Good girl. Break there. Hey, you. You got in here like a ninja. I didn't hear one step. What are you doing? Checking out the house, making sure everything's ready. Ahh. Yes. Big poker game. You haven't done that in years. Yeah, well... They've been busy, I've been busy. That's all. Anyway, taking a break from old friends sometimes reminds me how much they really mean to you. I love those guys. They're just as much my posse of delinquent uncles as they are your school buddies. I will make sure they hear that, baby. I have a more serious question. Does it involve cash? Am I your favourite child and most special daughter? I can guarantee that, mainly because you are my only child and only daughter. Mm. As your favourite child and most special daughter, there's the cutest denim jacket down in the arcade. Mm-hm. So I was wondering... Yeah. Yep. It's cuter than that. Look at what you've built. Mum would've been so proud of you. Hey, come on. Don't get yourself upset. Your mum is with us every day. She sees everything. And you know what? She'd much rather see you laughing than crying. I just miss her. I didn't think I could live a day without her, let alone ten years. - Jack. - Sam. Fuck. SAM: Now...if you decide on a testamentary trust and we know that time is of the essence here, then you will have to nominate a trustee. That trustee can be a person or persons, an organisation or a trust company. If you still want to explore the idea of a charity trust, then in addition to a trustee you'll have to nominate and appoint a board of directors prior to your passing. Now, your nominated beneficiaries, they'll be able to deal directly with your trustee. However, both your trustees and your board of trustees will be overseen and managed by a trust administrator. The trust administrator will report directly back to your nominated beneficiaries. In the event of dispute, we'll have appointed a trust protector so if your beneficiaries see that your trustee is no longer trustworthy... (MUSIC RISES OVER VOICE) ..trust administrator and will report back to and defend the rights of your beneficiaries. Now, look, I know this is a lot to take in. If you do the structure right, I guarantee it'll be tight as a drum. Now, in regards to tonight, everything's in place. I'm gonna meet the guys in the garage in ten minutes. Once I'm done there, I'll meet you at the pad. The pilot's standing by. Good. Have you told Drew? Not all the details, no. Devil's advocate. Tonight is all very elaborate, Jake. Are you certain you want to go through with it? And this I'm not asking as your lawyer. Plenty of people get by with flowers and cards. Well, they might not be the best decisions I've ever made but at least I won't live to regret them. See you down there. Hey, ah... ..I'm sorry. What for? Apply where necessary. REPORTER: Minister! Minister! The report on Family Affairs released today seems to contradict the stated intentions of your department just earlier this year. Well, Beverly, what you're really saying is that the general press contrivance to misunderstand the position we took last year... My department is aligned. We're putting the needs of lower-income families first and I know you personally support that, Beverly. No, Minister. Minister! MINISTER: Did you get the text? What the fuck are we doing, meeting in a car park? I thought we were meeting in the penthouse. Hello, Paul. Good to see you too. I'm sorry. Maybe the car park's where the private lift is, Minister. Yeah. Course it is. Let's do this. You don't want to wait for Alex? That arselicker's probably already here. You look like shit, by the way. Tremendous! You look beautiful. Hey. - You OK? - Yeah. We just have to tell him. Get it done. Yeah. It's on tonight, alright? Just don't forget the gear. You never know who you're gonna bump into, Billy. Some old mate you owe a favour to. I'm gonna have this bloke Styx with me. He's a little different. He's Polish or something. But we need him. He's connected and he knows what's what so just don't use your prison charm, OK? That's what I'm asking, mate. Just nice and easy. - Gentlemen. - Alex! - How are you, mate? - I'm good. You? - Geez, you don't age. - How are you? Paul, I'm Sam, the annoying one that's been texting you. Paul. Nice to meet you. So are we going upstairs or... Ah, actually, Jake thought you might like to meet him down at Pebble Cove. So he would like you guys to pick a car to drive. Any one you like. - You're kidding? - No. The keys are all in them. Sat navs have all been pre-programmed with the scenic route. Travel time is about 90 minutes but Jake would like you to think of it as a race. Jakey, Jakey, J... Where are you going? - Mike, I'm Sam. - Hi, Sam. PAUL: You keep away from that. That thing's mine. You keep away from the blue Rolls. So have you caught up with Jake much lately or not? Oh, not much. I've... I've been travelling. A couple of book tours and such, yeah. - Yeah, life gets busy, eh? - Yeah, it does. Mike, I'm afraid I'm going to have to drive you. You're kidding me? It was a fucking sip. Ahhhh! We're taking that one. Nice choice. Is anyone gonna say 'go'? Turn right. In 400... (HORN BLARES) (SOUNDS HORN) (FAST-PACED MUSIC) (INCOMING CALL) Hey. You good? DREW: Yeah, brother. How are you holding? - You gonna tune in tonight? - Right on showtime. Look, Jake, are you really sure you want it to go down this way, man? There needs to be a catalyst. We haven't had an honest conversation in years. And I don't have time to wait around for these guys to get comfortable enough to tell me the truth. Yeah. I get it, brother. - See you soon. - Yeah, I'll see ya. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRR) MIKEY: Fuck me, mate. Everything OK? I'm in a supercar race with a soft cock for a chauffeur. Everything's peachy. You know, all the specs say we have the fastest car. It's got a race engine. You're in a race. Maybe put your fuckin' foot down! (ENGINE ROARS) There are fresh ingredients in the fridge if you want to cook and everything you need for grilled oysters is in the fridge by the barbecue. Great. Penelope here? Yes, she is. She's downstairs, sir. JAKE: The guests will arrive in three separate cars, so meet them in the garage, take them to their rooms, - then to the wine cellar. - No problem. After that, you guys can take the night off. Just put the gate on code only. Hello, Mr Jake. - Everything good? - Everything in place, sir. Great. I think I might cook tonight. You sure you want to do that, Mr Jake? I'll try not to make a mess. MAN: Hello? PAUL: Thank fuck. Did you get my message? Don't go to the house tonight. The plan has changed. MAN: I'm not changing plans. Everything's been organised. No, no, you have to change the plan. I thought the house would be empty. He'll be there. MAN: It's going ahead. Time to clear your debt. No, no, it can't go ahead tonight, do you hear me? He'll be there. I'll be there. It's too close. He'll know. Please, man, just back the fuck off. Fuck, fuck! Having fun, Mr Foley? Penelope. Did Sam tell you what's going on? PENELOPE: Only that it's big stakes and that I'll probably finish early. He didn't elaborate. RFID chips. Live and legal tender. As good as cash. Five equal stacks. Texas hold 'em. Yes, boss. Yes, of course. Hey, look, um, I've got to go. Bye. Love you. (INSECTS CHIRP) PAUL: (KNOCKS) Mikey, let's go! - You right? - Yep. PAUL: Let's hit it. - There he is! - Alex. - Good to see you, Jake. - How are you? - Paul. - Jakey, boy. Always a pleasure. - Mike. - Hey. - How are you doing? OK? PAUL: Look at this! All good, Mr Foley? All good, Chris. See you tomorrow. You do know there are other wines in the world besides Henschke and Penfolds? Yeah, I have a rule with wine. Don't buy it unless you're gonna drink it. But I knew you would say something like that so small vineyard McLaren Vale shiraz. The Velvet Glove. - Oh. - Salute. It's been too long. Cheers, lads. To Drew and you, Jake. ALL: Absent friends. - How is Drew? - He's good. - How are the cars? - Oh, that Maybach is amazing. I put my foot down and I was here. Yeah, I wouldn't know how mine was to drive 'cause you sent the fuckin' fun police over there. Well, I'm glad you liked the cars because they're yours. - My gift. - What? I mean, that...that Maybach is a million-dollar car, Jake. Forgive my cynicism but what's the catch? There's no catch but I just thought we'd have a bit of fun and up the stakes tonight. The cars are yours, title signed over to you, or you can give up the dream car and exchange it... ..for $5 million in chips... ..each. Holy shit! $5 million. Texas hold 'em. Winner take all. There's a couple of wrinkles. One, you have to play. You can't sit out. And two, if one of you wants to keep the car then that's that. It's one in, all in and we'll just play for our usual stakes. Fuck. - Which car came first? - The Maybach. That puts you on the button, Alex. Just got to make the decision. Do you want the car or do you want the chips? I'll leave you to discuss it. Sam can answer your questions. Just remember, if you do play... ..you have to accept the outcome. If you don't play, you have to accept that outcome too. Wait, wait, wait, before we start. We... We can't do this. Can't do what? We can't take the cars. You're damn right we can't take the cars. It's $5 million in chips. It's poker night. Let's fuckin' go. Oh, come on, we can't take the cars or the chips. This is crazy. I mean, let's just play for our normal stakes, hey? I don't want to feel like I owe Jake anything. This is $5 million in chips. Each. Right, Sam? Mm-hm. So what's it gonna be, gents? $25 million on the table. Who are these guys? They're guys I grew up with. I'm giving them a couple of big experiences tonight and fucking with their heads just for old times' sake. They will probably say stupid shit when they drink, OK? And they'll flirt with a bedpost if they think they have half a chance. Mikey, wait. Just... Just... This is... This is too much. You know, I'm doing OK. I don't need this. I'm happy for you, Alex, that you're doing OK, that your books are sellin'. That's great. I'm not doin' OK. And I want to play. Just say yes, Alex. Mike... What about you, Paul? I think we should...just say yes, Alex. They're in. Good. We're... We're doing this. Yeah, we're doing this. You don't do things by halves, Jake. - Cheers. - Cheers. It's just a game, Alex. ALEX: This is a beautiful drop. Sweet Jesus. Fuck me! Not that I don't appreciate the wine, Jake, it's fuckin' lovely but I'll grab myself a poker player's drink. JAKE: Take the bottle. - Cheers. Let's go, eh? There's a humidor over there, if you feel like it. Don't mind if I do. Hello. I'm Michael. - I'm Penelope. - You left or right-handed? I'm right. You'll be right. Good evening, gentlemen. I'm your dealer for tonight. My name is Penelope. - Hello, Penelope. I'm Paul. - Hi, Paul. - Alex. - Alex. On my right hand here, Michael. It's a $5 million buy-in, no re-buy, Texas hold 'em, winner takes all. We will start small blind $25,000, big blind $50,000. Good luck to you all. MAN: If you love art so much then why do you steal? 2ND MAN: To possess it. Even just briefly to be close enough to smell the canvas, to touch the brushstrokes, I must possess it. Maybe it's just a bit too obtuse and deep for you, Billy. Maybe you're just not smart enough to understand. Oh, I'm smart enough to know which part of your face is gonna bleed the most. You fuckin' ferret. The blue car's the target. - Call. PENELOPE: Call. Raise. 175. Raise 175,000. - Out. - Alex is out. - Call. PENELOPE: Call. PENELOPE: Call. - Call. PENELOPE: Call. - Check. - Check. PENELOPE: Check. - Bet. PENELOPE: Bet 100,000. Raise 400. PENELOPE: Raise 400. Call. PENELOPE: Call. Sam's out. - Check. PENELOPE: Check. 700,000. Michael? - Raise 2 million. PENELOPE: Raise 2 million. Paul is out. - All in. PENELOPE: Jake goes all in. Michael? A quick game is a good game, eh, Jake? Thanks for the invite. I call. All in. First fuckin' hand. PENELOPE: 10 million in the pot. Ooh. PENELOPE: You both have the same cards. Jack and ten. Michael has hearts. Jake has diamonds. We have a straight or a possible flush draw on both. Split pot, gentlemen. Fuck me... PAUL: Right down the middle. Straight down the middle. (OMINOUS MUSIC) So we've been fucking talking about you walking from Melbourne to Sydney - for about 25 fucking years. - 30 years. And the bit of the story that I've never figured out is you didn't actually complete the journey. - Oh, I did, yeah. - (ALL LAUGH) I did, I did. In a car. JAKE: When you start telling that story in the future about the walk you did from Melbourne to Sydney, you should be telling the story about the walk from Melbourne to Orbost. That's right! MIKEY: Melbourne's got nothin' to do with it. It is false advertising, mate. It's a big title and the story doesn't live up to the title. It's absolutely false advertising. It's a bit like your last book. (MEN LAUGH) PAUL: And then he proceeded to offer me this cigarette. - Did you imbibe? - I did. I did. I thought it would be rude not to. Anyway, I didn't feel particularly different until later that night I went upstairs to the restaurant and I'm watching this band. And then I turned around and looked out the window and I came back and there's the kitchen. The band's fucking disappeared. So I look out the window again, there's the band again. And I'm fucking falling over all the time going, "What the...? "I must be really, like, out of my mind here." It took me about an hour to realise that it was a revolving rooftop restaurant. (MEN LAUGH) ALEX: What a fuckin' idiot! PAUL: I know. ALEX: That's brilliant. And that was my start in politics. PAUL: Ah, fuck off. Mr Foley left me a gift in my locker. No, I'm gonna show you when I get home. We can go anywhere you want, it's... Look, I'm just excited for you... You've got to see it to believe it. Look, um, I'm on my way home now. I'll see you soon. (BRAKES SCREECH) What's going on, man? (SOUND OF PUNCHING) We get to Vegas, we get to the hotel room so I start googling... ..arse problems. ALEX: Caution. Caution, my arse is in danger. Right? Every time you flinched your sphincter it was like an electric shock through my body. We get to this specialist, right, and I lay down and Alex is there with me. Thank you, Alex. And I lay down and he has a look at it. He's like, "Ooh, yep." He's like, "Yeah, you've got a perianal abscess." Just a terrific weekend in Vegas, wasn't it, Alex? ALEX: Wasn't it? - (PHONE RINGS) - Hey, Bec. When were you going to tell me? Ah, hey, I'm driving. This is some pretty big stuff. Just let me pull over and we can talk properly. I'm a kid. Is that it? I can't handle reality or something? What's the reason for keeping me in the dark? Listen, kiddo... ..about five months ago... This is really hard. ..your dad had a vasectomy, OK? He didn't... He just did it. He didn't discuss it with me. Now, I've always known that your dad, he...he loves you so much. And he didn't want to complicate your life with a half-sibling when you were younger. But I always thought that we would eventually get the chance to have a baby. So the vasectomy news, that was a... I've been in his office... ..looking at his medical records. He was diagnosed in September with pancreatic cancer. He's dying. He's dying and he wasn't going to tell me. Ah... It's OK, Bec. I'm going to come and get you, OK? Just stay... Just stay where you are, OK? It's OK, honey. I'm... I'm coming. I'm gonna come and get you and then we'll both go talk to your dad together, OK? (BEEPING) Hey, Sam, go and check that out for me? The door might not be closed. It's activating the system. Yeah, no problem. PAUL: You're getting the bill. Oh, that's right. Look at this guy. MIKEY: Bit of loitering. PAUL: Hope he's a better lawyer than he is a card player. So do I. PENELOPE: Call. (TENSE MUSIC) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) (GROANS) Any one of you motherfuckers gonna deal me in? Drew! - Fuckin' Drew! - Hey, Drew. Mikey Mike, what up, baby? - What's up, brother? - How you doin', bro? - What's up, brother? - How you going, man? Get the man a drink! What are you having, Drew? Give me a tequila reposado on ice, glass of pineapple. - Alrighty. -Pineapple. He likes his fruit. Hey. There's some things I've got to catch you up on. Yeah, I've been seeing the big money move. PAUL: (SINGS) Reposado. DREW: Y'all said I wasn't gonna make it, but... Are we gonna keep playing? No, I don't think so. MIKEY: Where's she going? We're still playing, aren't we? PENELOPE: It was a pleasure. Jake asked me to turn RIFFLE onto you guys this week. Why would you turn a military-grade surveillance program on us? At first it was just, you know, for laughs, maybe catch you scratching your balls in your driveway, show it on poker night, but RIFFLE, it doesn't stop. It criss-crosses your cell phones, home-security computers. Now, I'm not saying we know everything but we know enough to get me on a motherfuckin' plane. I feel sick. JAKE: I'm not surprised, Alex. I poisoned you on the base of your toasting glasses. It would've got on your hands. Your faces. Now it's in your bloodstream. Well, that's not funny. Are you serious? Poisoned? Fuck off. He's joking. Is he? I'm sweating like a motherfucker. I don't feel too good. The first signs are sweating... ..loss of balance, nausea and then... Then what? Stop fucking around. You want us dead. I've been diagnosed with an inoperable pancreatic cancer. It's a death sentence. So now we're all on the same level. Touchpad. Bring him over. MIKEY: Beautiful. - Done the job for me. - Jesus! Fuck! Fuck, Mikey. What was you gonna do? - Shoot us? Shoot Jake? - Me. I was gonna shoot me. That was the plan. I was gonna say goodbye to you all and shoot myself. Is this about the business? What did you think? We was gonna let you drown? Mikey, why didn't you reach out? I had no idea you were this unhappy. I put back two bottles of vodka a day, Alex. That's not the habit of a happy person. I'm alright with death. I'm not. I have a wife and kids. I've got people who depend on me. What is the code? I'm not gonna tell you. What's the code? You want another one? What is the fuckin' code? Car. Car, car. Get rid of the van! Get down! Hey. No noise, you hear me? Alright, when the car goes through, jump in front of the gate, stop it from closing. - (MUFFLED WORDS) - What? It doesn't work that way. It keeps going. The gate can crush the car. Is that right? Thanks, brother. (MUSIC ON CAR RADIO) DREW: What about your bank accounts, Paul? Savings? Checking? All on zero. How is that taking care of your family? I'm being blackmailed. They've got video of me with a girl. If it comes out... I gave them all the money I had. They want more. They want more than I have. - (GRUNTS) - Tell me the code! Tell me the code or you're gonna get crushed. Better fuckin' hurry up, mate. It's comin'. -Tell me or you'll get crushed. - Oi! Code. You'll turn into a kebab in a minute. - Code. - Tell him! (GASPS) 1967. (GATE WHIRRS) (LOUD THUD) I thought we were just here to steal. We are murderers now? You'll only get manslaughter, at most. Now that you couldn't give them no more money, what did you do? What did you give 'em, Paul? Jake. Email addresses, phone numbers. Sensitive information. I was just trying to buy time, that's all, I promise, Jake. I'm sorry, man. Who's blackmailing you? - Victor. DREW: Your brother? Yeah. My brother. I'm... ..I'm just so fuckin' ashamed. Oh, fuck! I'm having an affair. A terribly inexact word. Insufficient. It was never my intention to deliberately betray anyone. What happened to me, Jake, is that I fell in love. It just so happens that I fell in love with the woman you're married to. I can't die. We're having a baby. I can't die. You're not gonna fuckin' die. Not tonight, anyway. I just used a couple of drops. Nowhere near enough to kill you. Just enough to fuck you up and get you thinking. It'll wear off soon. I just wanted you, for a moment, to feel where I am. See things through my eyes. (POIGNANT MUSIC) My little girl is about to be hit by a train. And there's nothing I can do about it... ..because I am the train. So how long have you got, man? Long enough to finish the game? Mikey, you fuck! Lawyers recommend trust funds so they can keep charging annual fees. In fact, in most instances, simply transferring money is a tax-free gift to any normal bank account. That's the better option. You fuckin' guys don't get it. Jake and I brought you into the company at the ground level. And, Mikey, you sold your shares in a week, Alex traded his for a Rolex and Paul goes to Vegas first class. Now, if it was up to me, I would've given you all that we put aside for you but... And I told him, "Chill the fuck out. "Let's just start them with half," because we know you motherfuckers. What do you mean? We've still got shares? Yeah. Well, how much? $25 million in poker chips. Get fucked. (TENSE MUSIC) (BEEPING) Um, Jake. What the fuck? I hope this is another one of your surprises, Jake. No. It's Victor. He's here for the art. Oh, fuck. When you said the house was full of Australian art, did you mean pieces like this? They don't know where we are. Let's fuck off before they find the stairs. Through the cellar. Aboriginal art is not my forte. Are they worth anything? Well, yes, some of them are very expensive but...the market for this art attracts a certain type of buyer, someone who connects to it on a spiritual plane. It's a big house. Find us something we can sell. Do you think the place is empty? Three cars came in, four came out, all different cars. - Hey, shush! - Don't fuckin' shush me. DREW: They have guns. There we are. What about that? Warhol. Well, he's famous, right? STYX: Too famous. It's a Sunday B. Morning print, a couple of grand retail, if that. Not for us. Oh. Not bad. Henry James Johnstone. Hard to find in this condition. Look at the way he painted the light. Came to Australia to mine for gold, ironically became a photographer. Valuable? Mm, we could probably sell them. It wouldn't be a big ticket, though. Oi! Stairs, down here. Shhh. BILLY: Alright, here we go. You want a drink? Somebody already has. (TENSE, FAST-PACED MUSIC) - (LAUGHS) - Look at this! Nice! This is fuckin' two storeys underground. Boom! - Nobody's home. - Yes, there is. This cigar didn't light itself. There's a lot of eye candy in here. They're hiding somewhere. Billy, check around. Break out the guns and let's stop these motherfuckers. I don't have any guns. You've got a panic room and no firearms? I've got a panic room so I don't need firearms. There's holes everywhere, Victor. They've probably just fucked off. Look around! STYX: Victor. Victor, look at this room, man! Happy and Tall! It's like Ali Baba's fucking cave, man. - What am I looking at? - 1889. Melbourne. 9x5 Impression exhibition. 182 works, painted mainly on cigar box lids. They sold for a guinea each, couple of bucks. Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder. You've hit the trifecta! Now you're looking at $3 million at auction, easy. Grey market to us? High six figures. Happy days! I know you're still here, Jake. Ha! Yes, you fuckin' are, aren't you? Hello, Jake. It's been a while. Why don't you come and say hey to an old mate? We aren't gonna hurt anyone. We're just gonna take the art. Ask the Minister why it's safer not to call the cops. BILLY: Why the fuck are we on TV? Because our hosts are still in the house. Check up those stairs. What else is in here? We were just gonna hit this place in darkness. Nothing personal. Then Paul said you were gonna be here and I thought, "Fuck it!" I want to make it personal. It's good to have a panic room but you can't shoot a motherfucker with it. - We've got Mike's gun. - It's only got one bullet. I was planning on killing myself. Pretty sure you only need one bullet for that. STYX: Clarice Beckett. Genius. We can move these in a heartbeat. Another Streeton. William Dobell. Woman In Restaurant. Last sold for $939,000. John Peter Russell. So rare! He hardly ever exhibited. Classmate of Lautrec and Van Gogh. He destroyed 400 of his masterworks in grief when his wife died. - This is real fucking money. - How much? Even at bargain basement we are walking away with a couple of million. (VICTOR LAUGHS LOUDLY) You hear that, Jake? We know what you've got here. Oi. The stairs lead to the kitchen. I didn't see anyone there. Just like I haven't seen anyone out here or in the fucking garage and you know why that is, Victor? 'Cause there's no-one fuckin' here. Well, help Styx. VICTOR: Let's go! Jake. There's six of us and three of them. We can take 'em. It's only fuckin' Victor. They have three shotguns against one bullet. Let's just stay down here till he fucks off, OK? The more adrenalised he gets, the harder that drug's gonna hit. So what's this worth? Oh, a couple of hundred k, maybe. He painted a lot, Streeton. Even with a less significant work he leaves his mark of genius. Look. A lot of people believe that these marks of reflection are Streeton painting a portrait of himself painting the glass. You see, it's like a man leaning over an easel. So old mate had a green head, did he? There's a really good painting in the kitchen. It's a couple of men playing cards, one's smoking a pipe, wearing funny hats. That's the type of painting I like. Do you know why? Hm? 'Cause it tells a fuckin' story, right? Couple of blokes playing poker, they're on the piss, they're talking shit. I mean, that's just a...fuckin' goblet. - White pipe? - Yeah. - And tall hat? - Yeah, funny hat. - (BEEPING) - Fuck. Jesus! What's she doing here? Billy! Visitors. Who's this, Jake? Right, plan's changed. Give me the gun. There's only one bullet in it, man. They don't know that. Mikey. We're gonna go with your plan. I'll bluff this prick and I'll split 'em up. - I'll come with you. - Get the door, Mike. Dad? - Dad? - Oh, hello, ladies. VICTOR: Oh, hello, ladies. Come on, come here. Come here. - (SCREAMS) Come here. - (GRUNTS) - (YELLS) - (SCREAMS) - Shhh. BILLY: Come here! Come here! Come... Come here, you... Come here! Victor. Victor. Victor! The painting in the kitchen is a fucking Cézanne. That's a $200-million item. Who are we dealing with here? People who own art like that have got many ways of fucking you up. Go...away. VICTOR: My lucky day after all. You know, things were looking dull as shit till you turned up. Well, this changes things, doesn't it, Jake? I'm assuming you know these women? Come on in here, you prick. Do you hear me, Jake? Get your arse in here! What the fuck, man? Dad! Who the fuck is this? Our host, Jake fucking Foley. Look at you, big shot. You come into the room, gun in hand, like a common criminal. Victor. I see you're still the same shit magnet who goes around stealing other people's stuff. Don't get too cocky, Foley. You got three shotguns trained on you. You can't get all of us. I'm only aiming at you, Victor. Well, I guess we're in a Mexican standoff, my friend. You shoot me, I may or may not die. Depends if you can shoot, really, doesn't it? And even if you get me, these two will still shoot you, take your art and damage these fine specimens. STYX: No, I won't. I'm here to steal. I'm not damaging anyone. I will. He kills you, Vic, I'll defend your honour. Art will just be a bonus. If you want to steal some art you can make money from, upstairs in the kitchen, that's the one. I told you. Cézanne. $200 fucking million. No, you didn't. I told you that! You were going gaga about the fuckin' goblet. Just take it and fuck off. You don't tell me what to fuckin' do! You go get it. STYX: It's a two-man job. Just fucking get it, both of ya. They're going to the kitchen. - Right. - Righto. Let's go. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, don't be a clever dick, Foley. These girls will get the blast before you do. How do you want to play this, Jake? Dad, I'm scared. - It's OK, babe, it's gonna be OK. What's going on? Who is this guy? Where is everyone else? We are old friends, aren't we, Jake? It's Paul's brother. The others are sick. - Sick? Sick from what? - Poison. Poison? Jake, what's going on? You ever tried to sell high-end stolen art, Victor? Whatever that kid's telling you... ..art collectors, they like to show off. Who are you gonna sell it to? I'm connected. I can fence anything. You feeling OK? You don't look so good. You touched that glass. Yeah, yeah, I touched a glass. Wh... Wh... So what? Well, you might have a problem, then. That's where the poison was. On the glass. What kind of bullshit you trying to spin now, Foley? Why would there be poison on the glass? Why don't you ask my soon to be ex-wife, Nicole, here? She's been having an affair. I decided to poison her lover. What have you done? - I don't believe ya. - Ask her. Nicole. Have you or have you not been fucking one of my friends? Where's Alex? Where's Alex? You can feel the poison taking hold now, can't you? Right there. I've got a safe. In it there's a bunch of cash and what you're gonna need to stop the poison. I need it too. OK? I'm going to go and open the safe. One jumps, we all jump. DREW: Go, go, go, go, go. - Styx! Watch out! VICTOR: Slowly, slowly. BILLY: Got him? (STYX GASPS FRANTICALLY) (BOTH SCREAM) You think I'll let you have this, you dumb motherfucker? I don't give a shit if you die. Thanks for the money. I win! Enjoy your death from poison, you sick cunt. (YELLS) (LAUGHS) He's got the gun, Styx. Shoot the cunt. You're so far up your own arse, aren't you, Foley? You always thought you were better than anyone else. Well, I'll leave you here so these whores can watch you die. REBECCA: Dad! (COUGHS) (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (GROANS) JAKE: (VOICE OVER) Life's just a game, right? A game of karma, luck and physics. People don't always get to know when the game will finish. Are you ready? JAKE: On reflection, it's been a gift. I've never been misguided in understanding that the way we've created opportunity for ourselves hasn't had an effect in the lives of others. That's another one of Newton's laws. I can't change that. But I can try to rebalance. To that extent, half of my estate has been divided among 21 charities and foundations in the hope that money finds its way to those who need it most, including families affected by gambling addiction. This is the last will and testament of John... JAKE: (VOICE OVER) Drew, I've signed total control over both companies to you. There's a schedule for future profits that involves everyone in this room. Thanks for everything, man. What a riot that was. I'll see you again. Yeah, brother, see you again, man. Pauly, you have to get out of politics. It's not a healthy place. I hope $50 million will make the transition easier. SAM: Nicole and Alex... JAKE: Nicole and Alex... ..$50 million and a fund set up for all of your children. You're gonna be great parents. Mikey, Mikey, Mikey. There's $50 million for you too. You're doing great but you have to finish your 12 months in rehab first. There's no way around that. Mike. You can do anything you set your mind to. Rebecca, my beautiful daughter. I am so sorry about this. If I could change it I would. The remainder of my estate is yours. It's a lot of money, already in accounts in your name. You manage it. You'll be fine. - I love you. - I love you too, Dad. Bec, your delinquent uncles are in no way perfect but you'll find in life that friendship and love start when you forgive imperfections. Listen to them all. They've all got big life journeys to draw from. But listen to Drew the most. Be kind to each other. Don't be glass half empty or half full people. Be the kind of people who know whatever triumph or disaster comes along you can always refill the glass.
