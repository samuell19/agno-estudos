Preacher Rainey used to tell us this old Bible story back in Macon: "Satan tempts Jesus. "This world and all of its power I will give thee if you worship me." Now, all Jesus has to do is just fall down on one knee. But Jesus says, "Satan, thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God, and in Him only shalt thy serve." You see, you got to worship God or Satan.

I was looking at the front. - You didn't see him? - No. A man wearing a silver jacket just can't disappear. Come on. We want Little Richard! We want Little Richard! There you are, Richard. That was bad, big brother. That was a bad scene last night. You take off and there damn near was a riot. What's the matter, Richard? You feeling all right, man? I'm retiring. Look... That's... that's not funny. I'm telling the truth, Robin. Okay. So, what does that mean, man? It means I'm getting out. God's given me more success than any country boy from a shotgun house could ever dream of. He's been good to me. Lord, He's been real good to me. I just ain't that sure I been that good to Him. Why quit now, Richard? I mean, you... Why you gonna quit now? He showed me a sign. Like what? - Not that fireball. - It was a rocket. A Russian rocket. It was a sputnik. It can be a Russian rocket and a sign from God. It can be both. I saw that thing up there; I saw it. But I felt it here. It was a rocket. You can't just quit, all right? Richard, we've been a year and a half fighting to get to the top. That's when you do it... when it counts. Anybody can quit when they're failing. Chuck is right. You can't just... just walk away from this; you invented this. You are rock and roll. Now, you want to throw all that away? Yeah. Yeah, just as easy as I do this. Richard! That ring cost ten grand!

Nothing. I'll take him. No, no, not this time. Bud, You beat this boy every time he does something wrong, you gonna kill him. Now, you done whipped him three times this week. That's enough! Eva Mae, the boy has dressed as a girl. I can see. Just got a little devil in him, that's all. And I'll whip it out. No, you won't whip it out of him! Promise me, you're not gonna hit this boy. I won't touch him. Come on, Richard. Good day, Mr. Penniman. Won't Richard be taking his piano lesson today? No, Mrs. Clemens. Richard will be getting another lesson today. ...too many times over and over again. Get up! He's bigger than me. Then you cut him down to your size. I don't wanna.

Thank you very much, Brother Richard Penniman for that fine rendition. Now, today's sermon is going to be about a subject that a whole lot of you are familiar with. Namely, the Devil. Any time that you think the Devil is getting ahead, you... you know what you say? You say, "Get behind me, Satan." Yes, that's so right. "Get behind me..." We're real proud of him, Reverend. - Hmm-hmm. - He sings everywhere. We can barely contain this boy. Here he is. Richard. Richard, you know what? There's the Lord's music and then there's the Devil's music. Yes, sir. But a voice like yours should be used in the service of the Lord. Yes, sir, I do know that. - Hallelujah. - I do. All right, come on home. We going to get supper on the table, Reverend. All right, Ms. Penniman. Come on, baby. Choo-choo-choo-choo Choo-choo-choo-choo Choo-choo-choo-choo Choo-choo-choo-choo Choo-choo-choo-choo Choo-choo-choo-choo Choo-choo! If you make me come up there I'm gonna beat you silly. Choo-choo-choo Hoo-hoo! Robert, Richard, Marquette, get up. Get your clothes. I need you. Marquette, hand me a can. Richard, for heaven's sake, keep the light over here. Why can't we just... dig a big hole and bury the lot? Because the government men poke sticks in the dirt for holes but they never poke a garden patch. Well, why is that? Because this is Georgia, and... collard greens are sacred. Well, what happens in the winter when there ain't no more collard greens? Pumpkins. After pumpkins? Potatoes. - After that? - "After that?" After that, with God's blessing I'll have my own place. The Tip In Inn, that's what I'll call it. I'm not planning on laying brick and burying cheap corn liquor forever, no sir-ree. Got to have a plan. Got to have a dream. Y'all got to have dreams. When I get older, I want to own a club, too. Well, I'm gonna be a preacher just like Brother Joe May, the singing evangelist thunderbolt from the west. You can't be a preacher. You got too much devil in you. Ah-ah, I don't know. A lot of good preachers got a bit of the devil in them... even your granddaddy, and he was a fine preacher. Reverend Rainey? Reverend Rainey? Reverend Rainey? Lord, I need to confess. I did a terrible thing. It was me that wrapped the dog doo in that pretty red paper with the flowers on it and sent it to Miss Grady as a birthday present. Maybe it's the devil in me... and he's been making me think thoughts... about sex... and all... I guess you know all that... and I feel bad, Lord, but I still think them... and I know this isn't right for a future preacher and all. So, that's why I'm asking you for a sign or something or some strength to help me mend my sorry ways. Who's there? Lord almighty. Devil, get behind me. Devil, get behind me. ♪ Big leg girl ♪ Walk my way ♪ Big leg girl ♪ What I say? Whoo! Richard Penniman! It's blasphemy, is what it is! The boy entered the house of God and desecrated it! In all of my 30 years I have never seen such an insult to the good Lord! It's as if he said, "Well, come on in, Devil! Come on in and just sit a while!" We understand, minister. We understand. Do you? Because this is sin with a capital S! The boy will be punished. When I'm through with him, preacher... he'll wish he had never ever saw a piano, and if I ever hear about him playing one again I'll make him wish he had never been born at all. I know it was wrong for him to be playing them songs, but you can't beat that out of him. You can't beat that out of the boy. Eva Mae, Eva Mae, it's not just this incident! Not that I think this is insignificant, preacher but it's everything about the boy... the way he talks, the way he walks. A father's joy... is watching his sons grow into men good and strong and make-make one proud but it's clear as the blue sky Richard's not gonna grow into anything but an embarrassment. I feel ashamed every time I look at him. I wish he was no son of mine. He's your son, Bud. Stop it, Eva Mae. No, Eva Mae's right. You can't give up on your son. God forgive me but it's true. You promised me you wouldn't beat him no more... It's your fault for this 'cause you stopped me when I had a plan... Where you going, Richard? I'm done with this. Fried chicken's coming right up.

Richard, this is the standard deal... the only deal I give to all my artists. I pay for recording, the band, for Bump to produce you. I pay for the record to get mastered, pressed and released. When you go with your band on tour and are worshipped by millions I pay for the airlines, hotels, limos, and grease for the fat union guys. There's a royalty, which is five percent of 90% of retail not including a broadcast fee which is calculated on the amount of airplay a song receives, which in your case will be plenty. Any questions? Yeah. I am gonna make some money, right? I think I can safely guarantee that. The most important things to understand, Richard, are this contract is binding, you are gonna be famous, and the kids are gonna love that hair! Whoo, I'm going to be the specialty in Specialty Records. You hear me?

How come that radio station's not playing my record, huh?! Richard, maybe you haven't noticed, but you're not white, and that is a white radio station. At least Richard can sing. Listen, look at it as a good thing. I mean, Boone will cross the tune over to all those audiences we can't get at. We'll get a whole lot more exposure. It's all right, honey. At least you get to make some money. A little. What you mean, "a little"?! That's my song! Rupe owns the publishing company that buys from his record company. You get a half a cent per song.

What we need to do is go talk to Henry Nash. Robert, Henry ain't here. Since you our manager now, go tell the white boss man that his darkies won't be changing on the bus no more. Yes, sir, Mr. Penniman. I tells 'em straight. We'll be using them warm changing rooms. Oh, yeah, right. No, but tell 'em to expect some naked Negroes on the premises. Oh, that's bad, man, that's bad. Yes, sir. Anything else I should convey? You want the boss man to prepare y'all a little snack? - Say, some chicken? - Barbecue! Well, if ain't too much trouble I prefer champagne. Champagne. Miss Lucille, no trouble no trouble at all. Any other requests? Yeah, we tired of wearing all this sissy-ass makeup. Ri... Richard, I'm sorry but, I mean, this stuff just don't... just don't seem to be bothering you like it's bothering all the rest of us. Being pretty ain't never bothered me. Ain't that right, Lucille? About the prettiest boy I've ever seen. Now, sneaking in the back door so white folks don't see us till we on stage, eating in a parking lot of some restaurant I wouldn't even pay to eat at the counter at... Now, that bothers me.

You know how many coloreds have played here? None. You know why? 'Cause they can't. I am the first. I am the only. So if you want to call me sissy, go ahead. Knock yourself out, boy.

Tutti-frutti, baby. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Done had too much to drink, now. Hey, Richard. Sorry about that. I just wanna have a party with Richard. Richard. I need a little money for the bartender. Whatever you want, bro. Go ahead. Help yourself. Thank you. Miss Lucille. Lucille, child. Why don't you go get your king a glass of water. As you wish, sire. Yeah, and you, too, pretty boy. Mmm... with all them nice muscles. Mmm. What's your name, young princess? - Jesse. - Ooh, Jesse! Where'd you get all that pretty skin? Mmm! Both of you look good. Make my big toe just shoot up in my boot. Mmm. Why don't y'all kiss for Little Richard? Come on. It's for Little Richard. Just a little. Come on. See you later, Richard. Richard. Hey, there, Bump. Miss Lucille. Bump Blackwell, all the way from Los Angeles. To what do I owe the honor? You're up for a big Hollywood movie... a Jane Mansfield flick. Little Richard and Jane Mansfield. Hmm. I like it. Richard, can I talk to you for a minute? Excuse me, child. Maybe your daddy won't approve of you. Look at this. Richard, come here. Good times... tell me about it. So what about this movie? You know, it's a great deal, Richard but I'm worried. You see, these Hollywood boys are a sensitive bunch, and I don't think they're ready for some out of control wild man. Who says I'm out of control? Mr. Jackson, Mr. Grant, and Mr. Franklin. Oh, what? You still Mr. Rupe's errand boy? He sent you down here to go through my pockets? That's my money. That ain't Mr. Rupe's money. This has nothing to do with Rupe. This has everything to do with you. Richard, you keep money in a suitcase, and you gonna wake up one morning without any. And don't even get me started about the IRS. You are skating on a very thin edge. Last night's concert was damn near a riot. And now you've got this party two beers and a light switch away from being an orgy! An all-out orgy! With white women. White women! Man, have you forgotten where the hell you are? This is the South. You think you're too big to be lynched? Yes, I do. Why? Because you have a few hits? No, 'cause I give people a chance to shout. That's right, I am the genie up out of the bottle and I ain't going back in. Richard, you are talking completely crazy. Says who? You ain't my father, Bump. You can't stand there and tell me what's crazy and what's not! If I was your father, I'd be whupping your hide right now. But you ain't. So you can go to hell. Come on, baby, let's take a drive. Come on. Ooh-wee, Lord, look at them getting it on like two pigs in a gunny sack. Yeah, go get it now. What's wrong with you? I need more. Just wait. Okay? He look like he's about to finish and I want to see it. Richard, you have this idea of me that is not all true. You think all I am is this. This is Little Richard Weekend.

Jesus Christ has set us free. Maybe you're finding it difficult to believe in your heart that your sin has been forgiven. Perhaps you're thinking "I have lustful thoughts." But the fact is He has forgiven you. You simply need to claim His forgiveness and believe His promise. Psalms 103-11 says "As far as the East "is from the West "so far as he removes As far... our transgressions from us." as the East is from the West. You've been listening to the Reverend Grace... Yeah. Five Minutes to Live By. Mom? Mom? Oh, brah. How you doing, baby? Oh, it sure is good to see you. Look at you, Richard. Ma, why you living up here in this little room? I'm comfortable here. I take walks. Walks? Ma, this ain't a park. It's a house. Oh, quit your yelling. I got everything I need here. Everything. I got all my things here and all my memories. But Ma... Brah, you want a cup of coffee or a cup of tea? Ma, are you happy? Happy about what? Moving to Los Angeles. Oh, child. Don't worry about me. It's just an adjustment, that's all. You live your life one way, and it's hard to change. All I ever knew was Macon. I miss my friends and some of my kin. Of course I do. Now I don't have no regrets now. I don't have no regrets. Now what about... what about you, Richard? Are you happy? I don't know. I should be. Should be and being are two different animals, now, ain't they? Yeah, I'd say so. You always been uncommon, brah. That short leg and your big old head. You have a gift that moves people. Make them feel what you're feeling. But in the end you got to do what's good for you. You got to do what makes you happy. I just don't know what that is. Then you're gonna have to find out now, ain't you? I got one more question I need to ask you. Tea or coffee? Hello, sir. My name is Brother Lucher. I am a missionary for the Church of God of The Ten Commandments, and I have a very simple question for you. Have you heard the word of God today? I know you. Joe Lucher. You was a musician when I was a kid. You was famous. Yeah, they used to call you King of The Mambo, didn't they? I gave it up to become an evangelist. I run a mission and a soup kitchen downtown. Come on in, now. Come on. I'm going to Australia on tour in a couple days. And I'm worried. What are you worried about? It just don't feel right. I know I'm tired and all, but it just don't feel right no more. What is it you want, Richard? I want to be free. I mean, sometimes I just want to be totally free.
