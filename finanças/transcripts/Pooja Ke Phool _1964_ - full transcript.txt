Come on, guru. - Bela, this is my friend Khatpatiya. Bela, I would have come with you. What can I do? Until I don't take care of my parents' property.. ..it will be difficult for me to leave this place. Come early. - I will! I certainly will! I will come as quickly as I can! During that time, talk to a good pundit and.. ..fix a favourable time for our wedding. Bela, send some money. You know these lawyers. They keep asking for money. Yes, I'll send it. Good girl. Vijay! - Father, uncle has come! Balraj! Raj, you have come! Uncle, you should have written a letter before you came. No! I had a holiday in college for a few days. So I thought of coming to the village.. ..and eat food prepared by you. You did right. Tell me this. Why did you walk all the way from the station to our house? So what, brother? I had a walk and saved money on the rickshaw too! For saving 25 paisa, you took so much trouble? Brother! Brother, haven't you got rid of your cough yet? Raj, it isn't much. I am well now. Forget about all that. Tell me, how are your studies going? I will surely pass my BA. With your blessings, I may get a first class too. Really? Uncle, if that day comes, father will be overjoyed! Brother! - Bhootnath, greetings. Bless you, Balraj. Greetings. Tell me, sir. Did you catch a new ghost? Balraj, let me first get rid of your brother's illness. After that I'll look after everything else. Illness? - Dear, you don't know this angel of death. For getting money, he could make a good person ill. Vijay, give some warm milk to your uncle. Ok. Come, uncle. Come. - Go on. Hansraj, today I have brought such medicine.. Shut up! Don't dare to speak anything related.. ..to my illness or medicine before Raj. Oh no! I would never say such a thing! I have brought a potion to help Balraj think sharper. He can memorise a book well just by reading it once! Really? - Yes! Does such a drug exist? - Yes, why not? How much does it cost? - I won't take much from you. Give me five rupees now and pay me one during Diwali. Ok. - Alright. You are ready to pay for your brother's studies. For your illness, you won't be ready to pay anything. Give me the medicine! - I have just brought the herbs. I'll prepare it and send it to you by the evening. - Vijay, brother is coughing badly. Yes, he always has cough. The doctor said that he has tuberculosis. Tuberculosis? TB! Who said so? Who said so? I have tuberculosis? You may try to hide it, brother.. ..but your coughing and your appearance.. - Silly boy, I have no illness. - I have just grown old. That is why I said this, brother. This age requires rest. You don't need to sit near a fire and work for me all day. Brother, I'll quit studying and do some job. What did you say? You'll quit studies? Why not? - Sit here. Sit. Raj, you know why I am making you study. Everyone in this family has been a blacksmith. I thought that there must be someone.. ..who would make the family proud. It's just a matter of a few months. Once you pass your BA, if not a collector.. ..you can at least be his deputy. Raj, then I'll spread velvet on a bed and rest like rich men! Dear, don't delay our wedding. Otherwise father will get me married to someone else. Then I won't have anyway out other than suicide. No! What are you saying?! Sheela, the day I hear that you're getting married.. ..to someone else, my dear, I'll go to Delhi straight away! I'll stand on Qutub Minar, take your name and jump! Guru, Vijay! - Say Mr. Vijay Singh. Vijay Singh. - Sheela, my guru is coming. Go to your village. - So early? Yes! If my guru sees me with you, he'll report to my father. My father will get me married to someone else. Look, get a favourable time from.. ..a good pundit for our wedding. Go! Where? - Here. Hide! - Ok. Are you praying? - Come Vijay. I was praying to Hanuman for you. What is this, Balam? - The bond of love. What if someone sees us? If someone does, he'll be envious. He'll say, that the beautiful girl is accompanied by Balam. Vijay, today you really look great. Go away. - Where should I go? Now I will go only with you. Stop following me. - What is this Vijay? The days of love are coming close and you are retreating. Since this drape has begun to cover your head.. ..I have been desperate to see your face! If I would know that you would move away from me.. ..on attaining youth, six years ago when you fell in a well.. ..instead of saving you, I would drown in the well too! Really? Do you think that I don't care about you? Why don't you talk to father? Uncle has come from the town too. Wedding is a minute detail. Father and uncle are not required for that. No! A wedding is very essential. Father said to uncle that I will be married.. ..only after uncle passes his BA. Really? So if your uncle fails his BA, we won't get married? I don't know. Hanuman, get her uncle to pass in BA! I'll offer you offerings worth 1.25 rupees! Guru, is she final? Khatpatiya, you are still a fool. There are still more to come. This means, you still have more women. What say? You are right for the first time in your life. Quiet! Come! Get me some yoghurt and fried potato bread! What is it, you fool? What have you done to deserve fried potato-bread? If I could earn something, I would eat at a hotel. Why would I trouble your wife? What say? Shameless! You are worthless and shameless! Get lost! - I'll leave. I won't die due to hunger. Forget it. He had just come to eat bread. All I get is abuse! Son, parents wouldn't want to abuse their son. You don't care about our house. You have a young sister. Have you thought about her wedding? Gauri! Wait, Gauri! - Wait, dear. Get up carefully. - Up. Did you see? She spilled the water. Wherever she goes, she'll just spill water. Aren't you ashamed? She is blind from birth and you keep insulting her. If we would have a little money.. ..we could tempt someone for dowry and get her married. If you cared about your sister's wedding.. ..you wouldn't move around everywhere. Mother, this is not something that I can get by.. ..requesting for it. I can't get a husband for her. Mother, brother is right. The one who has been blinded by God.. ..can't be helped by anyone. Brother, I know that I am worthless.. ..for everyone in this house. Tell me, what do I do? You don't even let me go out and beg. I have heard that blind people get alms quickly. You speak as if you are well-versed with.. ..all the roads in this world! Where will you go? Brother, I am blind but I can walk on roads. Someone will take pity on me. You are blind and mad too! Think about it! Our father won't give us food. What can you expect from others? My God! What a son you have given me! Bring some bread for this dog! He should stop barking! Thank you. Don't try to hide your illness, brother. Have the medicines that the doctor prescribes. Medicines are worthless. There is only one solution to my illness. What? The day I hear that you passed your BA. You'll see that I'll be strong overnight! People will find it difficult to identify which one.. ..of us is younger and which one is older. Look at this. - What is this, brother? This is a potion. It's a concoction. Eat it everyday. You will be smarter! Brother! - Keep it safely in your pocket. Don't worry about me. Concentrate on studying, Raj! Bhatt, you haven't left yet? Well, I was looking at the Mathura murder case. Look at this point. - First check the time. 5.05. You have forgotten that I don't work after 5. Sorry sir. - Also, students must be waiting for me. Go home. Such murders are commonplace. Good night. - Good night, sir. The bus is leaving empty. Why didn't you go? A car will come to take me. - From where? You'll see. At 5.10 a man will come here and stop his car. He'll ask whether anyone wants to go to Gandhinagar. Does anyone want to go to Gandhinagar? Come on! - Good evening, sir. Come along. - No, I'll go in a bus. Where do you want to go? I have to go to Gandhinagar too. Come with us. - A bus is coming. I'll come by a bus. Is this car not as good as a bus? Come! Thank you sir. - You have to go to Gandhinagar, right? Yes. Come on then. I'm going to Gandhinagar too. It's nearby. I'll walk. You're weird! I don't leave anyone halfway. Come! - Thank you sir. In what year do you study? - BA final. What is your name? - Balraj. People call me Raj. Last year, at inter-varsity hockey championship.. ..a boy had scored four goals.. - That was me. You had also got first prize in inter-varsity essay competition. Yes. How do you know? I was present there when you were given the prize. - Ok. - Where do you want to go in Gandhinagar? Third main road. - You stay at third main road? I don't stay there. Mr. Chaudhary Hukumat Rai stays there. I'm going to meet him. Chaudhary Hukumat Rai. Public prosecutor? Yes. How do you know him? Well, I am a lawyer too. Chaudhary Hukumat Rai is as famous as the devil. Forgive me. Is he your relative? No. He is a very famous man. I'm a poor boy. How do you study? Do you get a scholarship in college? No. My elder brother works hard to educate me. Oh! What work do you have with Hukumat Rai? I have heard that he has an empty room to be rented. I have heard that he is a good man. Maybe he may give me the room at a lower rent. Hukumat Rai is a miser! However, for publicity he does help people sometimes. Where did you live before? - In a hostel. Were you expelled from the hostel? No! The hostel is expensive to live in. Are you married? - No. Then you'll have to live in the hostel. - Why? Chaudhary Hukumat Rai has a young daughter. His wife doesn't want to make a bachelor her tenant. I am a well-mannered boy. I'll explain it to her somehow. It will be too difficult to explain it to his wife! Have you ever had green chillies? Green chillies? - Yes. She is equal to that. Do something. - Tell me. Tell her that you are married. No, I won't lie to a respected lady. The times are such! What's wrong in lying for your benefit? I have never said a lie. - Start from today. I'll come with you and explain about you. Listen, you must lie in such a way.. ..that it appears to be the truth. No, I won't lie. - Don't be strange! You say that your brother works hard to educate you. His problem can be rid of by a small lie. What difference does it make? - But I have never.. Let me explain. Don't forget what I have taught you. Alright. - What? About marriage. - Come. Shanti! - Sir, whom are you calling? Chaudhary's daughter. Why? - It's nothing. Shanti. - What is it, daddy? Look dear, the outhouse that has to be rented.. Take its key from your mother. I'll get it, daddy. Sir, is this your house? - Of course. You are Chaudhary.. - Chaudhary Hukumat Rai. Public prosecutor Chaudhary Hukumat Rai? Why? Do I appear to be a fool? - You.. - Good boy. Daddy, the key. - Show him the outhouse. I'll change clothes. Come. Come along! - Come. Come in. This is your bedroom and drawing room too. This is a reading table. If you spread a cloth over this, it will be a dining table. This is the outlet for water. Do you like it? Yes, I liked it. - What do you like? The pitcher. - The pitcher? I mean, the room and all these things. I like them all. My mother. Greetings. - Greetings. Mr. Chaudhary told me all about you. What did he say? - He was praising you. What is your occupation? - I'm doing my BA. Do you have parents? - No. I have an elder brother. Are you married? - Married? Well, I am.. Tell her the truth. What's wrong in saying the truth? Mr. Chaudhary, I.. - He has been married for two years. How many children do you have? We have one. - I'm not asking you! I asked him! Try to figure it out. How many children can one have in two years? What are you saying? - That's right! He has got married and came to the town to study. His wife is pregnant. That's why he has left her at her parents' place. Which month is it? - December. December? I asked you how many months it has been. Oh! Seven months! I'm asking him and you are answering me! Correct! - What is correct? He is young. It's embarrassing for him to say all this to you. Ask me what you have to. I've talked to him. Have you told him about the rent? Oh yes! 40 rupees. 40 rupees! I.. - Of course. 40 rupees. But I am very poor! - Don't be weird! What has money got to do with poverty? What? - You will have to pay 40 rupees. That's not necessary. Can't we lower the rent depending on the person? I won't reduce it one bit. - Move away! Look son. Riches and poverty is not important here. Ask me anything you want. My name is Laxmi. Why Laxmi? Say Mahalaxmi. That's enough. Come on Shanti. Sir.. - 40 rupees. 40 rupees. The hostel would be cheaper than that. Don't act strangely. A hostel and a house are different. What are you talking about? Mr. Chaudhary I can't pay 40 rupees.. Silly boy, you have to pay only four, I'll add the zero. Sir.. - Is it still expensive? I won't forget this favour. - Forget it for the moment. Don't dare to forget one thing. You are married. Good boy! Good boy. Do you like it? - Yes, I liked it. I had to dream about a married man. Look, the more I take medicine given.. ..by you the more I am ill! It will be fine. - Father! Uncle has written a letter. Raj has written a letter? What has he written, dear? He says that he has left the hostel and.. ..is staying at a rich man Chaudhary Hukumat Rai's house as a tenant. He left the hostel and took a room! But why? Who will clean the room, give him food.. He writes that the hostel was expensive. For saving a little money will he take more trouble? Couldn't I send him money for a few months more? If he had to save money, he could do that after I died! Father! Father! What is this, doctor? Father is spitting blood! He works all day at a heated fireplace. Obviously, he will spit blood. These are the signs of death! - Get lost! I told you many times! Don't talk about my illness before Raj and Vijay. You just don't listen! - But I.. Get lost! Go away! Go! What are you writing, dear? - Nothing, father. Nothing. Nothing? I know. You must be writing a letter to your uncle. Yes, father. - What have you written? I have written that father didn't like you leaving your hostel. Everything else is fine. You are reading what you have written, right? Yes, father. - No! You are lying. I'll tell you what you must have written. Father is spitting blood. He may die soon. If you want to see him come quickly. That's it, right? Isn't it so? Swear by me! Swear by me! - Yes. I am illiterate. You may exploit your father's stupidity. Silly girl! Why don't you understand? If he hears such news.. ..he won't be able to concentrate on his studies. Father, forgive me. I was scared when I saw your condition. I will never write that! Never! You must have thought that I am on my deathbed. But I have already made a deal with God. Until I don't get news of Raj passing his BA.. ..he is to continue giving me life. He will listen to me! I won't die till then! Ram Singh. - Yes. Mr. Raj has come. Get some tea, toast and some sweets for him too. Ok sir. - You give him that everyday. Do you know anything about him? What is it? - You don't know anything. I know everything, dear but I thought that the boy is poor.. What if he is poor? He is a gentleman. He doesn't eat betel leaves. He doesn't smoke. Nor does he smoke cannabis. - Oh! There is one more thing. - What is that? Shanti's friends come to meet her. - So what? Does anyone dare to look at him? Do you know anything else about him? What else? I never saw nor did I ever hear about such a boy. But what use is he to us? He is already married. That's true. If he would be a bachelor, would I still be quiet? Wouldn't I get Shanti married to Raj straight away? Really? - What else? Completely true! Very good! You are very nervous. Nervous? I have just saved myself from death. Are you injured? I'm not made of wax to get hurt by a scratch. Well, forget that. You are probably going to college. Yes. - I am going to college too. Ok, go on. - Come in my car. I'll leave you. No! I have a habit of walking. - I have a habit of giving lifts. It appears to be the entire family's habit. - Yes. Come on then. - Ok, let's go. Tell me. How is your wife? She must be writing to you. Yes. She keeps writing letters. You didn't get a telegram yet. Telegram? - Yes. Why? You said that you are going to be a father after two months. Yes, I will be a father. I surely will. But it has been four months since you said this. So it must have been 10 or 11 months in all. Yes, it has been 11 months. - You haven't got the news yet? It is possible that there has been a problem on the way. I mean, the post may lose the letter on the way. Ok. - My college has come. Let me get off. Such a scared man! He forgot his dairy. Today I lied for the first time in my life. To get a room at Mr. Chaudhary's house.. ..I had to lie as he forced me to. I said that I am married. I had to lie as he forced me to that I am married. Lie! A lie! The first lie! Forgive me Shanti. I can't even sleep at night due to this fear. The day you find out my secret.. ..I don't know what you may think about me. I really don't get sleep at night. You can't sleep? Have you lost your sleep? You lied and lost your sleep. I know the truth and I will also lose my sleep. "Someone is taking away my sleep." "Someone is taking away my sleep." "Someone is taking away my sleep." "He gives a message of love from far away and leaves." "Someone is taking away my sleep." "I will be awake all night." "I will hide from you, beloved." "I will be awake all night." "I will hide from you, beloved." "I will never feel drowsy." "I swear by the moon and the stars." "Today I agree to this." "He gives a message of love from far away and leaves." "Someone is taking away my sleep." "When I talked to him, it came to this.." "When I talked to him, it came to this.." "When I took his name, there was a fragrance in the air." "There is an image that enchants me." "He gives a message of love from far away and leaves." "Someone is taking away my sleep." What is all this? Come in, this is the room. Mr. Raj! Yes? - Here is your telegram. Telegram? For me? - Yes. Take this. Why are you worried before seeing the telegram? I'm afraid my elder brother may be ill. Oh! A boy was born at 10 at night. The mother and child are both fine. Congratulations, Mr. Raj. Congratulations! I'll give this good news to mother immediately! Shanti! Please! From where did this telegram come? Come in, mother. Come. - Congratulations, Raj. What? - Don't pretend. Shanti told me everything. Open your mouth! Open! Ok, now give greetings. Greetings. - Not to me, to mother. Greetings, mother. - Not like that! You've had your first born. Lie down and greet her properly. Do it. Go ahead! - Bless you, son. May your son live a long life. Whose son will live a long life? What happened? What mistake did he commit? Get up! What happened? What happened? - I'll tell you later. First open your mouth. - What are you doing, dear? Have I ever opened my mouth before you? Open it today, father! - Why? Balraj has been blessed with a lovely son! Very good! A boy? You didn't tell us.. How could he tell us, father? He just got a telegram. Come on, mother. Let's distribute.. ..sweets in the neighbourhood. - Come. Mr. Balraj, you are invited for dinner today at our house. Don't forget it. You dared to lie to Chaudhary Hukumat Rai! You told me that you weren't married. I don't even know where this telegram came from. Where? It must have come from your in-law's place! Mr. Chaudhary, I don't have in-laws. Someone has played mischief with me. Don't worry. - Don't worry? Don't worry, my boy! Don't worry. What a problem! Did you see how I fooled him! - Shanti. - Yes. You are a lawyer's daughter, right? Why do you ask, daddy? Answer me. Are you are a lawyer's daughter or not? Yes. - You don't even know to lie. If you have to lie you should do it in such.. ..a way that it appears to be the truth. If you had to fool him, you should have.. ..had a telegram sent from his village. Not from our town and our neighbourhood. You want to be a lawyer and such an obvious lie! Didn't Raj lie? - I forced him to lie. I know. - How do you know? I am a lawyer's daughter. I can find out an obvious lie. - Listen. If your mother finds out about.. ..this entire deal, we'll be doomed. What then daddy? Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Guru! Guru! A money order from Mathura. Speak softly. Income tax officers may hear us. Hold this! Bend down! Guru, I am acting like a cock for the first time in my life. Hurry up. - Balam. Count it. - Such notes are not counted by weighed. The money. - Here guru. Cigarette. - Here. Thank you. Dear darling. Oh my! - Move away! I'm sending the money that you asked for. Thank you. - Thank you. Take care of your health. She cares about me. - She cares about you. You told me that you would come. You didn't come nor did you write a letter. I am waiting for you to come. She's waiting for my arrival! Don't disappoint me. Yours truly, Bela. You are too good, Balam. Raj! Raj! - Yes, mother. Tomorrow is a Sunday. You have a holiday, right? Yes. - Then, we'll go tomorrow. Ok. Where to? - To your in-laws. In-laws? Mother, tomorrow I have an important task. Are you a father? - No. No! I am a father. - What kind of father are you? You aren't happy even though your first child has been born. You didn't go to meet him nor did you buy anything for him. Well, it's ok. I have bought everything. Get ready to go tomorrow. But mother, my village is very far away! What if it is far away? We don't have to walk. We'll go in a car and return soon. Your car will be damaged. The roads are bad. They'll be alright if they are bad. Be ready tomorrow in the morning. Understood? Yes, I understand. My in-laws! "My dear man." "My dear man." "My dear man." "Where are you going at this time of the night?" "My dear man." "Where are you going at this time of the night?" "My dear man." "There has been a telegram from your in-laws." "Look at that." "There has been a telegram from your in-laws." "Your mother-in-law has been a spinster since 70 years." "If she gets a good groom.." "If she gets a good groom, she would be blessed." "My dear man." "Where are you going at this time of the night?" "My dear man." "If you don't mind, I would like to ask you, liar." "You liar.." "If you don't mind, I would like to ask you, liar." "Why do you hurt yourself with your dreams?" "You are crazy." "You are a stranger." "You are crazy. You are a stranger." "What are you looking at? Come here." "My dear man." "Where are you going at this time of the night?" "My dear man." "If you would leave secretly.." "I would never be able to tell you about my love." "Everything regarding my love would be suppressed." "My life would move on through tears." "If you would leave secretly." "I would never be able to tell you about my love." "Everything regarding my love would be suppressed." "My life would move on through tears." "Then my dreams and aspirations.." "Then my dreams and aspirations.." "..would never be fulfilled." "My dear man." "Where are you going at this time of the night?" "My dear man." "Where are you going at this time of the night?" "My dear man." Tell me, do you still want to run away? How can I escape? You have caught me. I haven't stopped you. Go on if you want to. This is strange! First you cut the bird's wings. Then you say that you have freed it. Tell me, Shanti. How did you find out about this secret? I have a sharp sight. - Really? Yes. The ones who act over-smart.. ..are trapped due to their mistakes. What do you mean? I mean your diary. - My diary? You don't have a right to read a gentleman's diary. Why did you lie to a respectable girl? If I wouldn't have lied.. ..everything would have been hidden. My life would pass by crying. Really? Your situation would be similar to mine. But this appears to by only my condition. A lie! - It's true, Shanti. Then why were you escaping quietly? To save myself from your mother. Try to think of a way out. That's it. I've got a way. Tomorrow this black cat will cross before you. Look, did you see him in the market. Yes guru. I saw him. - Come on. Vijay! Vijay! What is this? You came straight to my home! For God's sake, go back. What if father comes back? Has your father gone out? You said he's ill. Yes but he has to pay fees for uncle's examination. He has gone to borrow 200 rupees from somewhere. Who would have 200 rupees in this village ridden by poverty?! No! Go away. - Damn it! Since I have come here you are only saying one thing! Go, go! You should ask me why I have come here. What is it? - This matter concerns our lives. Come! Yes, Guru. Tell me quickly. Don't hurry. That's bad. My parents say that if I remain a bachelor I will be ruined. That is why they are arranging my marriage. Sit! Sit down. The girl's family is coming to see me next Sunday. Have you seen the girl too? Are you insulting my love? Silly girl! After seeing you I would never look at any other girl. Tell me! This darned boy is sitting next to my daughter! Don't do that, sir. Don't! He won't get hurt of you hit him with this. Take this one. I told him many times. But that fellow doesn't listen! Is he that shameless? - Too much! I'll tell you. You were going to borrow.. ..200 rupees for your brother's exam. Yes. - That's it. This guy found out about it! He broke into your house. I won't spare him.. - Listen to what I say, sir. He told me that an able boy's studies should not.. ..be hampered due to a deficiency of 200 rupees! The villagers and I are useless then! He has come to give you 200 rupees, sir. - Oh! Is that so? - Yes, sir. That is why I say that.. ..good people have no right to live in this world. My love isn't like the movies. I don't change women like a new heroine in every film. Son, forgive me. I didn't know that you.. - Guru! Have you mortgaged your watch and cycle.. ..for paying his brother's fees. You have, right? - Yes! Now you have come to give him that amount. Money? - Yes! Why don't you tell them? Yes! We have to give the money. He thought that you have come to flirt with his daughter. He had come to beat you up. Khatpatiya, no good man is allowed to live. I am the only one who has survived somehow. People make colleges and schools. Can't Mr. Balam pay 200 rupees.. ..for a good boy's education? Give it to them sir. Go on sir! Yes! I have come to give them the money. Here. Take 200. Son, you have done a big favour to me. I will repay this debt as early as possible. Sir, my rule is to do a favour and to forget about it. I have only heard wrong about you from the villagers till today. The world is so. It is against every god man. Today I have found out that the one who.. ..is thought to be worthless is actually a gem! Forgive me! - What is this, sir? Don't fall at my feet and address me as a deity. These days God too faces problems. - Alright, greetings. I'll leave. - I'm going too. - He came home without asking and helped us. He's a very good boy! He's a great man! Very bad! Very bad! Goodness has left the world. What if every man acts in such a manner? What is it? What happened? Raj, whom we gave a room on rent, is a thug! What are you saying?! He is really a good boy. Go away! Keep your certificate to yourself. Listen! What has he done? Why are you over-reacting? Didn't he say that he was married? - Yes. That was a lie! He isn't married! A complete lie! Is he a bachelor then? - Of course! What if he is? Why are you getting so angry? Be quiet! He lied to me. He tricked me. I am a public prosecutor. I have control over the police! I'll call them! - Look.. Why do you call the police for such a small affair? Call him and reprimand him. No! I don't want to talk to a liar. If you want to, you may call him and talk. What should I say? - Tell him, to get his wife if he has one. Then we'll see what he does. He doesn't have a wife! Whom will he call? That is what we have to see. Does he still stick to his lie or not. He's coming. Say it. Don't leave him. Mr. Chaudhary, my exams are over. Now I want to go to my village. - Good! Very good! Ask! Ask him. Son, you didn't introduce your wife. Bring her here before you go to your village. Are you narrating the alphabet? There is nothing to laugh in this case. Why don't you get her? Go now and get her here! Didn't you understand? - I understand. I'll get her. You said that he isn't married but.. ..he has gone to bring his wife. That is what I want to see. He will lie again to hide the previous lie. Then I'll punish him. Now I'll see whom he gets. Look! Look who he has got! What is this? He has brought our daughter! She is our child! - Greetings, Mr. Chaudhary. Greetings. Bless you. What is all this? I don't.. - Be quiet. Sit down. I'll explain. - What? What did you just say to him? - I told him to bring his wife. Correct. You told him to and he brought her. Since when have you become his wife? She isn't. She is going to be! You decided without asking me. Why not? Didn't you say that day.. That is regretful. If he would be a bachelor.. ..I would get Shanti married to him straight away. Didn't you say that? - I didn't say no. Why then are you arguing? You liked the boy, I fixed their wedding. Why did you have to say so many lies? People say numerous lies to make a marriage. I did my work with one lie. - You did a fine job. Oh! So this is my reward! You boy! Leave this house right away! My God! When did I ask for this? You didn't say that but that is what you meant. Will you go or not? - He won't go. He won't go? - No! He won't go? - No I said! They both will go. Go on you two. Go! "The trouble between two hearts has been resolved." "The world has recognised love." "Every goal for love is easy now." "Two people have been introduced to each other." "The trouble between two hearts.." "A pitiful man passed though this lane." "I don't know what you did to call him." "You called him in such a way.." "He thought it over and became yours." "The world saw this and is surprised." "Two people have been introduced to each other." "The trouble between two hearts.." "I have been waiting for you since a long time." "Then I saw that you were standing before me." "We locked eyes in such a way.." "I forgot about the world." "I couldn't think about anything." "It is as though my soul has lost its vigour." "Two people have been introduced to each other." "The trouble between two hearts.." "The beloved who had to meet have met now." "My stories have merged with yours." "Now we have the same story and the same tale." "Now we have the same song." "Two people have become one life." "Two people have been introduced to each other." "The trouble between two hearts has been resolved." "The world has recognised love." "The trouble between two hearts.." Daddy! Daddy, who has sent that telegram? Raj, your brother is a little ill. Perhaps your niece has sent this telegram. Father ill. Come immediately. Vijay. Mr. Chaudhary, my brother is very ill. I know that. Don't worry. We will all come with you. Go and get ready. Come. - Come. Father! Uncle has come. - Raj has come? Brother? - Yes? How are you feeling, brother? - Nothing is wrong with me. - I am just a little weak. Tell me, how was your exam? Will you pass or not? The papers were good. I will certainly pass. I don't need anything else. Hansraj, don't worry about Raj. He will pass and I will have him learn till he gets his MA. Raj. - Yes, brother? Who is he? The same Chaudhary Hukumat Rai. I stay at his house. - Oh! Forgive me! Such a big man has come to my house. I can't even welcome you with respect. What are you saying, Mr. Hansraj? Don't treat us as outsiders. Raj is your brother and is our prospective son-in-law. This is our daughter, Shanti. - Yes. We want to get our daughter Shanti married to Raj. All we are waiting for is your permission. You ask me for permission? I feel as though my brother has been very lucky. I am the one who is lucky, Hansraj. I got a son-in-law like Raj. Maybe you don't know how talented your brother is. Only time will tell what a man he turns out to be. He will certainly be. If he remains under the protection of elders like you.. ..there is no doubt that he will be a great man. Father. - Father! - Hail Ram! Did you hear that child? Your uncle will be a famous man. Today my dream has come true. Raj is getting married to a girl of such a good family. We will be related to such virtuous people. Please rest father! Father! - You ask me to rest and are crying! I am not crying, father. - Are you trying to deceive me? Are you thinking that.. ..I have done nothing for you? Why do you say that father? It would be better if I sent you away after being wed. However, after Raj is married to a girl of a respected family.. ..you will get a good husband too. Brother, do you think I will get married before Vijay does? No. First I will get Vijay married in a good family. After that I will think about my wedding. Did you hear what your uncle is saying? Why are you crying? Raj will do everything he can for you. He will be better than me. Brother, it is my duty to keep Vijay happy. Raj. Vijay. Raj's wife. This is such a jolly time. Raj has passed. He became an officer. Vijay's wedding procession is on its way. Raj is wearing a garland. Raj.. Raj.. I am your.. Raj. Be brave, Raj. Take Vijay and come to the town as soon as possible. How can I come? I have to take care of the entire house. I also have to find a groom for Vijay. Certainly. Get a suitable groom for him quickly. Then bring them to the town. We'll get Vijay and Shanti married together. Don't worry about anything. I will take care of everything. Okay. Come. Snake! - What happened? A snake! - What are you blabbering about? Wait! - No! No! Leave me! Do you think Balam can't do anything? Hold this cigarette. No, Balam. - Oh my God! Oh my God! Give me my cigarette. What would you do if he would bite you? What if he bit me? People have fought lions and elephants for love. Can't I kill a snake for saving my love? - No.. I know. You are still sad for your father. Ok. Let's go to a fair. You will feel better. I won't feel good. - A fair comes only once in a year. No. I have to go home. My pot has broken down. Oh! The pot! Yes! We'll take the pot from there. Look, I won't take no for an answer. Come. Come! Come along! Vijay. Vijay! Vijay! "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "My beloved, you may test my love." "My beloved, you may test my love." "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "This affection may hurt. Keep away from it." "This affection may hurt. Keep away from it." "I will die due to you." "I will make myself famous in this world." "By dying, I will bring myself closer to your love." "I will die due to you." "I have seen many lovers like you." "The ones who swear by love. Hey Jamalo!" "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "My beloved, you may test my love." "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "This affection may hurt. Keep away from it." "Look at this lover." "He is like a bee without wings." "He can't deceive me." "I know him very well." "Look at this lover." "You may hurt me, I won't mind." "I won't stop loving you." "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" It's a bow and arrow, show the heart. "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "My beloved, you may test my love." "You won't listen to me when I am alive." "You would realize who I was when I will die." "I have realized your love." "Come, hold my hand." "Come, hold my hand." "Smile and be my companion." "I am yours and you are mine." "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "Hey Jamalo!" "My beloved, you may test my love." "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "This affection may hurt. Keep away from it." "This affection may hurt. Keep away from it." "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" "Hey Jamalo! Hey Jamalo!" Vijay! - Uncle, the old pot broke. I was delayed while trying to buy the new pot. Really? - What, uncle? It's not just the old pot that has broken. You have also destroyed the respect.. ..that this family has for itself. You should have remembered that your father has just died. You have started dancing around.. ..with that worthless Balam. Uncle, you may call me anything.. ..but don't call him worthless. - You are supporting him! - Father! Shameless girl! Don't take the name of that great man! If father would have seen you with him.. ..he would have killed you. Uncle, if father would be alive today.. ..he wouldn't do such a thing. He would ask me what I want and what I desire. Tell me what he means to you! He is the one who wants to marry me.. ..and make me his own. - Vijay! What are you saying?! Balam will marry you?! Yes. Vijay, think wisely. Don't act foolishly by blind love. Balam isn't a man who can be loyal to someone. He will leave you midway. Uncle you have only seen him. Not his love. In my childhood, he risked his life to save mine.. ..when I was about to drown in a well. Even today, if he wouldn't have.. ..saved me from a snake, I would die. This doesn't mean that he is a good man. He is a very good man. That's not all. When father couldn't get money for your exam.. ..he loaned everything he had and gave the money to father. Father had said what a good boy he was. He helped us even when we didn't ask him for it. Father saw his goodness and thanked him. It is possible that brother may have become emotional. Vijay, I'll return his money. He won't take it back. Uncle, don't measure him by money. Look at his heart. - What should I see and.. ..what should I not see? We both see him to be different. Yes. No one will think that I am right now. Father did but he is dead now. - Vijay! He was the only one who knew. It would have been better if I too would die with father! Don't speak so harshly, Vijay. Brother has not just given you to me. He has also entrusted me with your happiness and fate. I will never hurt you. I thought that a wrong step shouldn't ruin your life. The one who makes a mistake deserves punishment. If such a thing happens, I won't blame you. However, forgetting this is impossible for me now. Whether I agree to it or not.. ..but everything will be as you want to be. Uncle! Uncle! - Vijay! - Uncle. - Don't cry, Vijay. Don't cry. If you cry I will think that my brother is happy. - Don't cry. Vijay. Look, what you say is right. But Balam should approve of this wedding. He certainly will. They love each other. That's not all. They have even decided to get married. A marriage is decided by parents. - Think about it. In their children's happiness, lies parents' happiness too. If you refuse, that poor girl will be ruined. All I know is that Vijay can't survive without Balam. But still.. - Listen. Please come here. Excuse me. I'll return soon. Sorry. - Look ahead while walking. Why would I fall if I could see? Forgive me. It's alright. Look, we don't refuse to this relation. The whole village praises your late brother Hansraj. But we are more worried about Gauri's.. ..wedding rather than Balam's. Gauri? The girl who just went in? Yes, she is blind. We may bribe someone with dowry and get her married somewhere. But we don't have money. If you help us with money.. ..we agree to Balam's wedding with Vijay. Look, I have many problems too but I accept your condition. Hey mister, you are exploiting my father's helplessness. You are benefiting from my love. Son, be quiet. This is a matter of your sister's life and death. As if I don't care about my sister! Mother, I speak less and think more. I think a lot! Let me give you some advice. - Tell me. Instead of helping us with money.. ..why don't you get married to Gauri? What? - What do you mean by 'what'? What if she is blind? She is beautiful and cultured. She takes care of household chores.. ..better than a person with sight. But... - What? This way our family's bond will be strengthened. If you accept, two houses will flourish. If you refuse I will move away from my happiness. For my sister's happiness, I will sacrifice my love. I will move around like crazy talking Vijay's name. Vijay too will be a spinster forever in my remembrance. I can't do anything more than that. Very good, guru! You are great! You have made a spectacular move! He could have got money from his rich father-in-law too. Now Raj won't refuse to marry that rich girl.. ..and I won't be troubled due to Vijay either! Come on. Let's drink some tea. Why have you bought two similar wedding saris? One for Shanti and another for Vijay. There shouldn't be any difference between the two. Correct. See? Father and daughter are both generous. The mother isn't ungenerous either. How can that be? Mahalaxmi has to be benevolent. Sir. - What is it, brother? Why do you appear to be so sad? Didn't you stitch the clothes? What do I say, madam? My workers don't work properly. They kept a hot iron on your dress and forgot about it. What?! Did they all get burnt? No. Just the groom's shirt was burnt. - Show it! There. Raj has come. He will live a long life. Hey you. Move this shirt and go away. Come, son Raj. What are you staring at? Your son-in-law has come. Get something to eat. I'll get something, dad. - First ask him what he wants. - I know what he drinks. - Very good! Come son, sit. - Mr. Chaudhary. I apologize. Apology for what? I know you came late but you have come. Is Vijay well? Did you get a groom for her? Yes. - Very good! Son, we have already made two pairs for everything. You don't know what I have come to tell you. Look, don't talk about a favour and embarrass me. I am ashamed and can't speak, Mr. Chaudhary. I can't marry Shanti. - What? Raj, maybe you mean that your conditions.. You may assume them to be my conditions. The person whom Vijay wants to marry has a blind sister. So what? - She.. Is that the condition for Vijay's marriage? You are to marry that blind girl? Yes. What have you decided? There is nothing to be decided. You know about the promise that.. ..I gave to brother as he was dying. You also know that only after hearing it.. ..did he die with peace. Tell me, how can I do that to his daughter? But try to understand my situation too Raj. What decision would you take if you.. ..would have been in my place? If you would be my elder brother.. ..and I wouldn't fulfil my promise, what would you think about me? That would make you a traitor. Do you want to make a traitor your son-in-law? No Raj. I think that sacrifice is the greatest thing. Only a father would understand what.. ..Shanti must be going through right now. Raj, I won't force you for anything. I'll explain it to Shanti somehow. For now, go and console her. Explain to her that if coming together.. ..symbolizes the earth, sacrifice is the sky. Go on. Shanti. I am guilty. But you think about this also that why.. ..did I take away your smile and made you cry? You can take it as my helplessness. Or my bad luck. But I had to take this decision. Actually, I am the unfortunate one. And I've got the blame of turning out.. ..your fortune to misfortune. I got the passion of love ignited in you. And when that started to flare violently.. ..I got it extinguished. I promised to flower your path and got thorns spread. I know, the pain that I am leaving in your heart.. ..and going is something more worse than death. Was it not better Shanti that I never could've come in your life. And I could die before I could see your desires, die. Don't say so, Raj. It's not even your fault. One who breaks someone's heart is the real culprit. And the one who breaks his own heart.. ..for the happiness of somebody else's. He's actually a God. No Shanti. You're trying to cover up my disloyalty to love by.. ..giving the name of sacrifice, to my selfishness. The loyalty to duty is much higher than to.. ..that of the loyalty to love. Even if you'd got me by forgetting your duty. Then all my life I'd have thought that.. ..I did marry a selfish man. Actually, you're marrying a blind girl by rejecting me. You're becoming an eye for some one's blind eyes. Whenever I'll think of it I'll be able to.. ..visualize a picture of yours like a praying.. ..woman opens her eyes after meditation and.. ..sees that her God is standing in front of her. Shanti. I am an unfortunate. That I did not get the opportunity.. ..to stay with that God. But, this too is my luck. That every day in my meditation.. ..I'd be offering my prayer flowers at the feet of that God. Go Raj. Go on the path of your duty with great joy. I.. I'll see you off smilingly. Shanti. I know of the pains hidden behind this smile. Your brain has forgiven me for sure. If possible, please ask your heart to forgive me too. You look like a picture of beauty, Gauri. Crazy. It's actually a time to celebrate. And then I am marrying Gauri happily for happiness. Laugh. Laugh. "Actually, 'The Lord' did bless you today, out of joy." "Got you a place in flowers by picking up from thorns." "Why should I be living on false hopes?" "I do have the right to go back." "If he's got me here." "Don't get despaired, understand.." "..the gesture of nature." "The forehead of yours has got shining now." "The rope of hope shouldn't let go off your hand." "Like a coward." "Don't take to death like a coward." "Don't take to death." Mr. Raj. Congratulations! I've got this present from Mr. Hukmat Rai's end. 'Son Raj.' 'Hand over this necklace and sari from my end..' '..to my niece Vijay, on this auspicious moment." 'You assume this as a present from your..' '..brother Hansraj's end.' 'Give the other one to my daughter, Gauri.' 'Best wishes from all of us.' Vijay. Take this. What's this? The wedding night. Rubbish! Such a small room. Small room. Yuck..! Yuck..! The honeymoon should take place on mount 'Everest'. Did you understand? What's this? A garden! It has all the flowers. But, where's the cabbage? Who are you? Sorry! Oh Anarkali! Are you shy of your, Birbal? I am yours, Vijay. I see. You're the one who used to meet me at farms. But.. I am your wife now. From being a lover, you've become a wife? Alas! Is it that, you didn't want to marry me? What's in marriage? The days before the marriage were so enjoyable. Singing duet in open and now.. The world's a cart and we, the bullocks. Understood? Why are you standing? Come sit. I asked you to sit. Come. After that.. ..the oven got lighted.. ..and the bread got made. Till today I've only got to hear your complaint.. ..from the villagers. Why talk of the world, it only is against the good. But I've realised today that the one who was.. ..taken to be as worthless is actually so precious. Don't put me in a difficult situation, Vijay. Brother didn't only hand over you to me but.. ..he also made me the guardian of your happiness. I won't let your heart break in any condition. I was only thinking if a wrong step of yours.. ..could get your life derailed. God! Gauri. What's this you're doing? Its here that lies my happiness. You sit here. Why don't you sit please? Yes, I too shall sit. As I can't see you. Nonetheless, I've got a beautiful picture made of yours in my mind. Now, you only are my eyes. From the time I've got you, I feel as if.. ..I've got my sight back. Now, I'll be able to see the world through your eyes. Gauri, the God didn't bless you with eyes. But, don't mention it all the while. Sleep. Brother. I've fulfilled my promise given to you. But I am afraid, Vijay won't be happy. Brother, forgive me. Shanti. I've refused your love, Shanti. I've done injustice to you. But still, you've forgiven me. You.. You're great, Shanti. You're great. You're great, Shanti. Shanti. Greetings. Dear, Raj! You've come after many days. Greeting, aunt. May, God bless you dear. I hope you're fine. - Yes. How's Gauri? She's good, aunt. You'll be leaving for the holy places so early.. ..I'd not thought of it. Son, we'd to go anyway. So, we thought it'd be better if we leave early. Balam is not visible. I've been waiting for him only. What to say, he's not returned home for last two days. Son, you please sit. I'll call Vijay. Ok, aunt. Daughter-in-law. - Yes, mother. Daughter-in-law, look, your uncle has come. Uncle! Uncle! How's Gauri aunt? How about you? Everything's fine. Vijay, Balam.. - He's just gone out. Yes, uncle was saying. I tried a lot to make you understand. Still, I got you married to your desire. Now your happiness is in your hands. This doesn't mean that my responsibility is over. All my life I'll only wish that you ask.. ..for something and I do that for you. Oh hello! In-law brother. You're here? Perhaps, you've come to see your niece. Why, can't I come to see you? Good people like you don't come to meet me. My class is slightly higher. I'd not seen Vijay after marriage. So I thought of seeing her once. You've come. But do you know, why I didn't come to you.. ..to see my dear sister? Why didn't you come? That's because, the distance proves good for relations. You too understand this. After marriage, Vijay is my problem and.. ..Gauri's yours. So, why don't we take care of our own problems? I think you're an intelligent man. You must've understood what I meant. Ok, I'll tell Vijay that her uncle has given his blessings. Good bye. Daughter, Shanti. The result of BA is out. What happened, father? What'll happen? If you could've worked hard, I would babbled.. ..in front of the world saying, you did this. You did that. Now, I'll only say that the daughter of.. ..famous 'Public prosecutor' has passed in first class. You were nervous, right? See this.. Father. Get me admitted to law college. Really! So, my daughter's surely going to be a barrister? Very good. - Very good. What, very good. Oh dear! Your daughter has passed in first class. Flatter her a bit. Being my daughter, could she have failed? - That's what. But, there's no need for her studying law. Yes. There's no need. This house has got everything by God's grace. Yes, it has. Now worry about getting her married. Yes, that's right. Mother. Don't talk about my marriage. Daughter. To get their daughter married is every parent's wish. Father. If you don't want me to study law, then don't. But.. But, don't talk about marriage. Why? You forgot so soon. What'd happened in this house few days back? What was that? - Please look. Let this poor study. The time's the biggest doctor. Slowly, she'll forget everything. You're more intelligent than me. It's not so. - What more can I do? Let her study. At the slightest pretext, you.. You're happy now? Become a barrister. Father. - This paper.. Oh yes! Raj has passed. Seeing his name topping the list.. ..I did feel happy as well as, shocked. Shocked because, I'd thought of making him.. ..a successful lawyer as he's able. Man proposes God disposes. Gauri. What have you done this? I was sweeping. You've put all the dirt in the rice. It was a mistake. Since I can't see. That's why I say, what the need to work is. You be seated. But.. Doing the household chores is the duty of a woman. Even this doesn't look good that I keep sitting. And you do all the work. If you can't do any work, what benefit is it doing? You want to help me, instead it gets doubled. Go and sit. Go. Oh! 'My dear Balam.' Thank you. 'I hope you're fine.' 'You always write that you'll come and you don't.' 'Now one can only see your signature..' '..on the receipt of the money-order.' 'Give my greetings to your friend, Khatpatiya.' Greeting. 'Come immediately, getting the letter.' Yes, as if the vehicle is yours. 'Yours, Bela.' Boss. Only letter, no money order? Khatpatiya. It seems the bank of Belapur has gone bankrupt. Now a new bank has to be searched. Yes, boss. Boss, boss. - What's it? Boss, I forgot to mention. Sheela has got a big problem in the village. It's heard, she's pregnant. And she says yelling that she'll avenge you. Khatpatiya. It's something like doing the impossible. I don't fear any of these Sheela, Bela.. What's the problem of these Sheela and Bela? Boss. That's, someone creating a problem unnecessarily. Actually, these Sheela and Bela are two orphans. I help them when I've money. And when I can't, they start defaming me. But after all, why do you go to other woman? Vijay. I am not a child that you've come to make me understand. And then, don't you see that an outsider is standing.. ..you've come in front of him. Go, light the oven. Go I said. 'You too understand that after marriage.. ..Gauri's your problem and Vijay's mine.' 'Now, your happiness is in your control.' 'That doesn't mean I am free of responsibilities.' 'All my life I'll only wish that you ask.. ..for something and I do that for you.' Gauri! What's this you're doing? I was filling water for you to bathe. To hell with my bath. If today you'd drowned.. ..the world would've held me responsible. O God! Gauri! Gauri, these actions of yours have got me troubled. What do I do? Even death doesn't come. You say so as if I've put you in trouble. - No. In fact, you've given me all the happiness of life. You've given up your peace, your rest.. ..everything for me. Gauri, don't you again talk of my past life. Understood? Go. Go and sit inside. Boss, Balam. - Yes. Boss, get some tea if you don't mind. Wow! You've already had three cups still you ask for one? Dear, want to make up for you loss? Anyways, not a problem. Vijay, get a cup of tea. Please listen. Please come over here. O my! She's made me stand while I was winning. Come on, play on for my hand. Boss, your hand or cards. - Cards. Boss, hits a lot. What's the matter? Where do I get the tea from so frequently? There's no milk, no sugar and nor the tea-leaf. And what about the five rupees that I gave, yesterday? What's so big of five rupees? Last night, all your friends had food. Had breakfast in the morning. Have had tea three rounds of tea. How long will five rupees last? I know you pass on my money to your uncle. Right? My uncle's not of the sort. You dare answer to me. Come on, get in. Gauri! You're troubled and you're troubling me too. Who'd asked you to get my cot here? It was cold outside so I thought you.. ..might catch cold. I'd have got sick of the cold at the worst. I wouldn't have died for sure. I am already drenched in unhappiness. You think I am living. This isn't living, it's a punishment to live. If tonight you died of the burn, what would.. ..the world have to say? Only this that the wife was blind.. ..so I knowingly let her burn. Who can stop the world from commenting? May God, do so that I get burned and die. So that at least your life turned into a happy one. Do you think I am not aware of your distress? Last night too, you were taking her name only.. ..while sleeping. You've again got back to that? You're misunderstanding me. I didn't mean that. Today.. Whatever I'll be saying today, shall be true. I swear on you. You please call sister Shanti to you. And if possible, give me a corner in this house too. I.. I'll serve you both. Gauri. Gauri. For God sake, don't say such things. Do you know, the one who you speak about.. ..frequently with aversion. Actually, the same kind soul convinced me to marry you. She herself turned her life into a hell for you. She got herself sacrificed to adorn your forehead. If you ever again take that kind soul's name.. ..I am afraid, I'll lose my control. Either my hands shall be at your neck or mine. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Aunt, Gauri. What's the matter, aunt? Why do you look sad? Aunt! What's the matter, aunt? Tell me. What happened? Don't cry. Come. Come inside. Come. Shanti. Daughter, congratulations. You've also cleared the law exam. It's all your blessing, father. Shanti. I am aware of the pain behind this fake smile. But daughter, you're the joy of this house. We live, seeing you. Tell me, what have you decided about yourself? Daughter. Let bygones be bygones. Now, think of the coming tomorrow. Father. I've only decided this that I'll practise. And shall become a successful.. ..lawyer with your blessing, getting your.. ..name to a greater height. You've only thought this? You can practice after marriage too. Father, I am very disturbed for now. Don't force me for marriage, please. All right, as you wish. There's no hurry, think at leisure. Oh yes! I just forgot. There's a letter for you. Yours Vijay. Vijay? 'My good sister, Shanti.' 'You'll surely be surprised getting this letter.' 'That, how did Vijay got to remember you.. ..after this big gap?' 'Sister.' 'Perhaps, I was born for this only that.. '..I get you, uncle and aunt Gauri to suffer.' 'Uncle did sacrifice his happiness.. '..for the sake of mine.' 'And in the process, three homes got ablaze.' 'Now I am sure that the life of aunt Gauri rests with you.' 'Aunt Gauri, says to the extent that if you..' '..marry uncle right now, then aunt Gauri shall get peace.' 'I leave the decision to you on this.' 'As a stupid girl like me can't qualify to..' '..make you understand.' Who's that? Greeting. Greeting. Where's Mr. Raj? He's gone to office. Which office he works in? He's a clerk in the court. Clerk in the court! Yes. Who are you? Actually.. When he used to study in the city, he was our tenant. Not only a tenant, but like a member of our family. I see. My parents take him as their child. It's my luck that you've come. Please come. First, have a seat. Oh! I'll do it. Sit sister. - You.. You've come at such a time that he's not at home. And I.. Take me as your sister. Don't you've any help? Sister, the unlucky ones don't have one. They themselves are one. Why do you say so? Who else is lucky the than the one who's.. .. got a God like husband. There's no doubt to that, sister. My husband is actually a God. But is very sad. And I am the only reason for all his sufferings. May, God bestow death upon me. - Sister! Then perhaps, he may get peace. Sister, why do you say so? Peace is something, which is in one's mind. Doesn't he love you? He's heart is full of love. But, that love can't reach me. Nor am I the rightful one, either. He's done so much for a blind like me. This favour of his is in itself so huge. He's very great, sister. He doesn't say anything but he keeps naming.. ..somebody while sleeping. He says, Shanti, please forgive me. I've done injustice to you. Now, you only tell sister, when his Shanti.. ..is somewhere else then how can I get peace living. And my peace is only in death. Sister. It's the cowards who take to death. If there's a pain in one part of the body. That doesn't mean one should chop it off. Come along. Come, sister. Do you know sister, how do you look now? How do I look? Like the first ray of the sun at dawn. Perhaps, he's coming. Look, don't tell him that I've come here. Ok? You.. Why are you silent? I've come from office, tired. And then, what's there to talk after all. You didn't see me properly. I did. I did see nicely. Did I ever say that you're not beautiful? Then what's the use of this make-up? Even a corpse is cover with shroud and.. ..flowers placed on it. Then, can't I adorn myself when alive? One gets beautified when there's a need.. ..to win someone's heart. One has to allure somebody. The situation over here is, the target has himself become a victim. For God sake.. - Enough. Whatever, I've done till now is for God. Have done for the world for some other people. But what has this world done for me? "Stop a little." "Stop a little." "Let me explain you, what life is?" "The one that you couldn't find till today.." "..to you, what's that joy." "To break somebody's heart." "This is not life." "To break somebody's heart." "This is not life." "Taking the pain of others." "Is it not happiness?" "Walk in a manner as if.." "..these winds blow." "Walk in a manner as if.." "..these winds blow." "They blossom the flowers." "They make the gardens laugh." "The one who lives for himself." "He's not a man." "To break somebody's heart." "This is not life." "The one who's got gloom." "Give smile to those lips." "The one who's got gloom." "Give smile to those lips." "By giving your peace." "Take a bud in return." "Your heart is one treasure." "There's no dearth of anything to you." "To break somebody's heart." "This is not life." "Whether, it's a moon or blazing fire." "One should see the light in both." "But whichever, one saw." "One saw away from the blazing fire." "The one who, blows away someone." "It's not a light." "To break somebody's heart." "This is not life." "Taking the pain of others." "Is it not happiness?" Gauri! Gauri! Please forgive me, Gauri. For God sake, please don't say so. - No, Gauri. Please. - No. Gauri. Gauri, please forgive me. Tea. It was only for tea. Why? Have I done something remarkable? What else you could do? I used to think, Gauri and I are the banks of a river. Which can never, meet. But, you've got them together. That's enough. Now, stop your praises. You've not thought till today.. ..that who'll look after the house after you leave for the office. You could've at least hired a help for sister, Gauri. How could I think of it? I wasn't a human till today. You've awakened my sleeping humanism. I was a lost traveller who you got on track. Let bygones be bygones. By forgetting it.. .. make this small world of yours a heaven. You've already made it a heaven. We've just got to take care of this heaven. I don't know how I will return this favour of yours, Shanti. Shanti! Is it you.. Yes, sister. The same Shanti for which.. - No. No, sister. You're something more than Sun and Moon, for me. You've given me the sight. You've got the lamp of my heart, lighted. Sister. If you've done so many favours, please do one more. Please, let me touch your feet. - Sister. On the arrival of whose this house has.. ..turned into a heaven. Sister. You're great, sister. Sister, you're great. Since I've become a pauper, even friends.. ..have stopped coming. Play on credit, I am an honest man. What's it, come on show. Boss. Boss. - Yes. Boss, newspaper. Did you steal it? It's not so, boss. Boss, read it first. Sheela has committed a suicide. A girl named Sheela, who was pregnant before marriage.. ..has committed suicide by jumping into the well. O God! By her letter it was known that her lover had.. ..married some other girl. But, she didn't write the name and address in the letter. Khatpatiya. She was good at heart, poor. Or else, I was to be hanged today. May, God rest her soul in peace. You've got the yesterday's paper. It's hard earned money. Go and return it. Go at once, you thief. Are the killers better than the thieves and dacoits? Killer, which killer? You. Did you not kill that innocent girl? What rubbish you speak! Whose? - That of Sheela. Sheela! Which Sheela? The same orphan girl who you used to help with. Today it's Sheela who's died of you. After that who knows, how many innocent girls shall follow the same. Who will fall a prey to your lust. You've become very daring. If you ever try to get into my issues, I'll.. ..not spare you. Did you get it? As if I am living now. I'd died the same day when I caught on to.. ..you even after uncle tried to make me understand. I warn you if you ever do so like this ever. "Meow! Meow!" "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." "Tell me, how my beloved looks like." "Tell me, how my beloved looks like." "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." "I've recognised his heart." "It's full of love." "That the eyes don't move away from." "Is the eye like that?" "I've recognised his heart." "It's full of love." "That the eyes don't move away from." "Is the eye like that?" "How does he walk, tell me." "It must be like a river." "How does he walk, tell me." "It must be like a river." "The lips must be like the petals of rose." "Meow! Meow!" "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." "Tell me, how my beloved looks like." "Tell me, how my beloved looks like." "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." "Seeing him I wonder if the Moon does envy." "Standing in his courtyard, I hope it doesn't get hyper." "Seeing him I wonder if the Moon does envy." "Standing in his courtyard, I hope it doesn't get hyper." "Does the wind happen to touch his hair, everyday?" "Does the wind happen to touch his hair, everyday?" "I've come to know as to why I am full of aroma." "Meow! Meow!" "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." "Tell me, how my beloved looks like." "Tell me, how my beloved looks like." "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." "Meow! Meow! My friend." "So nice, my friend." Oh! Sister, Shanti! You look very happy today? I won't speak to you, sister. Why? You did forget me the moment you went away. Do you have any idea of the difficulty I.. ..faced getting the neighbour write the letter? Let your anger calm, now. Oh yes! You'd written that you'll give me good news. What's that? Sister. You won't let me know? You really won't? No. Wait. Now, speak. Speak up! Speak up! I see! So this house is going to get a new member. Boss. Master. Boss. - What's it? Oh! I wanted to meet, boss. He's not at home. And don't you ever try to meet him. I know it's you who's got him spoiled. Me? No one can get a nuisance spoiled further. I am only the caretaker of boss. Sister-in-law, if it wasn't for me the police.. ..could've arrested him long before. Don't talk rubbish! What sin has he committed? The first sin he committed was to take the birth. The second sin is he got grown up. And the third one is, he's still alive. Yes, it is. Who's it? Oh master! What are you doing here? Boss, I was singing your praises to sister-in-law. Ask her. Ask her. - It's a lie. He was speaking ill of you. And you were hearing all that standing. Right? Go away from here. Come on, go. Why you.. - No boss. You were speaking ill about me? - No boss. You dare so. Take this. Get lost. Boss. Don't forget, you've hit me today. But you too are in my control. If I let out the secret then you'll be finished. So it's you who'll get out the secret. Get lost from here. Boss. You must've come across cowards till today. Note it down, my name's Khatpatiya. Start counting your days from today. Yes. "Beloved, I'll get you seated on the eye-lids and.." "..I shall show you the world's beautiful creations." "This earth, the mountain." "The vagrant cloud." "The gestures of these cooler than flowers, breeze." "Tearing apart the heart of the cliffs." "I wonder who of great hardship.." "..has made these statues." "This elephant of stone." "This priest and temple." "These many ages old relics." Oh you! Beloved, what have you done to yourself? I know you must have got burn out by missing me. I was coming to you only. Come, come. - Yes, I was coming to you. Today, all the decisions should be done. The decision of love is not done in these by lanes. Come, come. Let's go to our spot. Come. Come on. Come. Hurry up! Hurry up! Move. Eat. What's it? Come. Don't you think this place is worth of loving? Now tell my love, what do you want to say? When will we get married? It'll happen very soon. When? Let my troubles be over, after that. Will the government grant permission for second marriage? What? Second marriage? You mean you are married? Not me, yours. Is Vijay not your wife? Who's Vijay? Who told you? - Your follower. So this is Khatpatiya's deed. When you knew that I am married. What made you come here? I've come to ask for justice in front of everybody. Is it? So, you've come to announce. Bela, don't forget that you're a woman. There will be no harm to me. It'll be you who'll get defamed. I see. So, you kept befooling me. Is it for today that I kept sending you money.. ..selling my house, jewellery? If you kept sending money, I too kept sending the receipt. It's so fair. - Oh! So, your love was an excuse. You were after me to destroy. I too shall not be mute. I'll get all the people collected. What harm will you do to me? What's the proof that you have? Proof! - Yes. Your letters. You love letters. - Ok. The fake promises hand written by you. See this. So, you think you can drag me to the court? Why the court, the decision shall be done here itself. What decision? The same which you always used to say. That in life we'll be together, whether we live or die. The first one holds true, the second one is a lie. If you want to die, die alone. I don't know to backtrack on my promise. I won't die alone, I'll take you along too. Even if I am supposed to kill you. You dare so? You think you can kill me. Help! - Help. Help! - Nobody will. Gauri, I'll just be returning. Help! - Where'll you go? Listen to me. Help! - Help. Help! - Nobody will. Help! Help! Balam, what happened? Nothing. Let me go. - What's the matter? Let me. - Balam. Who's it? Uncle. - Yes. No, no. I'll not let that happen. I'll never let Vijay's life destroyed. Uncle! Murderer! Murderer! What happened? - Shanti's mother, it's shocking. Raj has murdered a girl in his village. Our Raj. - Yes. Look at this. His picture is printed with name. This is impossible. - Look. He's in 'City Jail'. I'll go and see him. Yes, you please go. - Father. I'll come along too. - All right. Let me change. Raj, what's this you've done? What have you done my boy? Mr. Chowdhary, I've murdered. I can never believe this. That you can murder someone. Shanti. There are many things in life which are strange. But they happen. Mr. Chowdhary. Did you ever think of it that.. ..I'll trample all your happiness and get separated from you and family? There was a reason to it, Raj. Your promise, your duty. But a murder can't be committed on somebody's whims and fancy. There's a reason to everything. But one can't argue on every issue. Nor shall I argue. Raj. - Mr. Chowdhary. You please leave me on my own. Raj, don't lose courage. Tell me everything clearly. I'll resign the government job and fight your case. There's no hope of I getting freed. The police caught me committing the crime. Not a problem, Raj. I've a request. Yes, please tell. I am ready to do everything for you. Please tell, Mr. Raj. After me, please care for Vijay and Gauri. That's ok Raj, but.. Raj, at least listen to me. Raj. - Mr. Raj. Raj.. Father, what has happened to him? He's completely changed. Yes, he's hiding from us too. Come, daughter. Brother. Why are you quiet? Say something, at least. I should be mute. Brother, who else can save him, barring you. What can I do now? He murdered and got caught. It's not so. He's innocent. He's wrongly implicated. Do the police ever catch somebody not guilty? Why would he have to murder anyone? Why don't you please go? Somehow, get uncle here. Now, how do I do that? If he'd consulted me before killing.. ..I'd have given him a full proof plan. But the stupid kept sitting there after murdering. Brother, do anything. Please save him for God's sake. When did I want that my sister becomes a widow? The maximum I can do is, I use my name.. ..and influence, hire a lawyer and get him.. ..life imprisonment instead of execution. Brother. Can we not do any other thing? Is this something, less? Anyway. The issue has got too far, daughter. Raj's case has been handed over to the session. Is it? - Yes. And I've to take on the case as a public prosecutor. So, your attempt will be to get Raj convicted? I regret, daughter. But I've to do this duty. Father. Had it been that I'd married Raj. You still would have done this duty? Shanti, I surely have affection and sympathy for Raj. But the law has no room for emotions. He's accepted that he did commit the crime. Every, witness is against him. The evidence is against him. If the same evidence and witnesses turn to Raj's favour, then? Daughter, this is not possible anymore. Father, please don't get me wrong. I want to take up this case from Raj's end. That means, you'll be up against me? The law has nothing to do with relation and emotion. But remember, I'll be a lawyer against you.. ..in the court and not your father. I don't want your concession but the blessing. It doesn't matter to me. If I win the case, it'll be a lawyer's win. And if you win the case, then that'll be a father's victory. Either way, the victory shall be ours. Good luck. Silence. Silence. Prosecution may proceed with the case. You honour. This is a clear case of premeditated.. ..deliberate and cold blooded murder. You've already heard to the witnesses from.. ..the prosecutions end. Which has amply proved that the convict.. ..only is the murderer. Still in the light of all the witness.. ..I reiterate the whole incident once again. As per the statement of the police. On 22nd August, in the evening at five. The convict took a young, beautiful girl to a lonely place. With an intention to kill. Over there, he pushed the girl from the hill to death. By chance, two shepherds who were passing.. ..from there, heard the cry of the girl. When they went running towards her they saw her body.. ..drenched in blood and the convict.. ..standing close to her in a perplexed condition. Seeing the dreadful scene, they both ran.. ..towards the house of Inspector Ramlal. And they narrated the whole story. Inspector Ramlal reached the spot swiftly. At that time the crowd had surrounded the convict. So, he couldn't run away from there. And the convict was arrested. Secondly your honour, the convict accepts.. ..the crime that he's committed in the just mentioned way. Thirdly, the post-mortem report of.. ..Dr. Bal Krishna, supports the statement of the convict. That's why I'd request the court to give.. ..the convict a befitting punishment. Thank you, your honour. Do you accept your crime or not? Yes, I accept. Who was that girl and why did you kill her? I've accepted my crime.. ..and I don't want to say anything besides that. If you don't want to argue yourself then.. ..the court can arrange for a lawyer for you. You honour! I don't want to argue on my case.. ..nor do I wish to have any lawyer to fight the case. Your honour! Let me be given the permission. So that I can argue from the convicts end. Sir! I don't want any support for my defence. Your honour! I am not asking the convicts permission. But the convict's sister has asked me to.. ..speak for the convicts case. Ms. Shanti, if the convict is himself not ready to co-operate.. ..then why do you want to argue on this case unnecessarily? Your honour! If the convict is accepting the crime.. ..why does he try to hide the circumstances which led him to do this. Till the time he.. - Nobody can force me to speak on this. That implies your silence is because of your impuissance. It's not my.. Ms. Shanti, you're granted the permission to argue over this case. Thank you, your honour. Now I request the court for the prosecution witnesses.. ..to be cross examined. Proceed. Inspector Ramlal. - Yes. Did you arrest the convict? Yes I did. How did you come to know of the crime? Two shepherds came to my house and informed. Did they tell you what they saw? Yes, when they were passing from there.. What were you doing then? Sorry! What were you doing at that point of time? I did have a night shift on that day. I was resting in my house. Were you in uniform? - No. I was wearing a casual dress. Oh! So, you went to the spot in the same dress. No, I didn't. - I did go wearing the uniform. How much time did it take to change? Nearly ten minutes. What would be the distance between the crime spot and your house? Almost two miles. How much time did you take to cover that distance? Nearly twenty minutes. I see. You took ten minutes to change and twenty minutes to reach there. It means you took thirty minutes in totality? Yes. Were you able to find out, who the deceased was? Where did she hail from? Not yet. The corpus was kept at the mortuary for two weeks. It was even advertised in the newspapers. But no one claimed the corpus. It seems the deceased was an orphan. Inspector Ramlal. The post-mortem report says, there was a scar.. ..on the body of a knife. Were you able to find the knife? No. We did the entire search but could not find the knife. Does it mean that you even advertised for.. ..that unclaimed knife? Actually, the thing was.. That's all. You can go. Thank you. Swear on God that whatever you say shall be the truth. Swear on God that whatever you say shall be the truth. You'll say the truth. You'll say the truth. Not I but you. Not I but you. All right. Ms. Shanti, proceed. Look. You've said that you passed through the way.. ..where the killing took place. I was not alone madam, my uncle was also there. All right. But what was the need for you to pass from there? Madam, that's the only way we use to take.. ..goats back home. What did you see there? I didn't see, first I heard. There was a shrill cry. Order. Order. Sir, one who wears the shoe knows where it pinches. So the moment you heard the scream you ran to the spot? Yes, madam. And you saw the convict murdering the girl? Tell, is it true or not? It's all a lie. When I reached at the spot the girls was already dead. And the killer was standing to her head. Yes. And the killer had the knife in his hand, right? Knife!? - Yes knife. The knife which he used to kill. No, madam. I didn't see any knife. That means you didn't see the convict, murdering. What are you saying madam? I and my uncle are brave men. If he did kill in front of us then.. We'd forced him to run away by shouting. That means you saw the convict.. ..at the time when he had already killed. Yes. Now you've got it right, madam. I saw and I kept shouting. I kept shouting. How did you decide that the same person is the killer? Yes madam, this is something to think about. I'll just go and ask my uncle. - No. What? You only tell. - I object, your honour. The defence counsel is trying to twist the.. ..the witness's statement so that he forgets.. ..the convict had got stained with fresh blood. It was fresh, that's why? Objection, your honour! The prosecutor is trying to put words in the.. ..mouth of the witness. Mr. Chowdhary, you can't teach a witness.. ..while he's being cross examined. I am sorry, your honour. I didn't mean that. Proceed. The moment you did see the girl's dead body.. ..you ran towards inspector's house? No madam. First I went to the police station. The inspector was not there. So I went to his house. How much time did you take to go from there.. ..to the police station and then to the inspector's house? I don't wear watch.. ..but still around half an hour to forty five minutes. You can go. God bless! God bless! Second witness. Dr. Balkrishna. - Yes. In your post-mortem report, it's mentioned.. ..that the deceased had the knife injury too.. ..with other injuries. Yes. Was it a deep wound? It was actually sufficient to lacerate the.. ..membrane of the heart. I see. Now, I want to ask a very crucial thing. Which the prosecution knowingly let.. ..it go unnoticed or it simply did go unnoticed. Was the death of the deceased happen.. ..to take place because of the stabbing as.. ..mentioned in your report? From the post-mortem report it is evident that.. ..there was a very little gap between the.. ..stabbing and then the fall of the deceased. Both incident almost happened with little time separation. What do you exactly mean when you say that? I mean the death occurred within thirty seconds of the incident. Thank you doctor, you may leave. Thank you. Your honour! After the cross examination of the witnesses. There are four points which draw special attention. The first, who's the deceased and what was.. ..the reason behind her killing? It's still a mystery. Second thing is this that there's no witness who has seen it happening. Even those shepherds reached there after the incident. Third one is the able 'Public prosecutor' taking.. ..the help of words like storm and lightning.. ..did try to prove that Inspector Ramlal reached.. ..the spot immediately and arrested the convict. But the convict's arrest happened after.. ..an hour of the whole episode. Your honour! If the convict did murder intentionally. As claimed by our able 'Public prosecutor'. Then why did he not run away from there? What was the need of standing near.. ..the corpus for an hour? Was he waiting for the police to come and arrest him? Fourth and the last one is this that the corpus.. ..was lying there it self and the convict was.. ..standing to her head. But the knife with which the killing took place. Went missing mysteriously. Convict Balraj, what did you do of the knife? I've already told you I killed that girl by pushing her from the hill. Then where does the question of knife arise? You're trying to hide the actual murderer. You're lying that you've murdered. I am telling the truth. If this is true then why don't you tell the reason to kill? I killed that girl because.. I killed for.. I killed her, I don't want to say anything besides that. I request for the honour of the court. Permission granted. Your honour! I plead to the court that I solve the mystery of the knife. Permission granted. Dr. Balkrishna, please. Dr. Balkrishna. - Yes. Is it possible that the deceased while.. ..freely falling from the hill could've collided.. ..with a sharp cliff whose wound would.. ..be similar to that of a knife? Which cliff could be like a knife? I am asking the question, you please answer. In my opinion, there can't be such a cliff. What's this? Stone. Does it not resemble a knife? Yes, it does. That means the deceased could've possibly.. ..hit such a similar stone and could've got.. ..the wound similar to that of a knife. It's possible. Very good. Thank you, doctor. - Thank you. Your honour! The defence counsel did try to prove that.. ..the deceased had a knife wound. But I say, that was not so the case.. ..but of the stone with which she collided. And that push was given by the convict. You just now told in your statement that.. ..on 22nd August at around five. You and your husband were eating something.. ..at some lonely place, that you heard the cry for 'Help!'. Yes. Ad your husband ran to that direction leaving you. Yes. In the meantime, you encountered somebody's feet running. Yes. And that was a male feet. Oh! Was it that your husband took you to such places before? No. That means the day this incident took place.. What do you want to ask? I want to ask what made him take you on that day. That's because, it was his off. He took me to show the old temples, hills.. ..and statues inscribed on stones. And did you like those? Yes. It was beautiful. Very good. Since when are you blind? By birth. Your honour! The lady who's blind by birth was taken by.. ..her husband to see those things she mentioned. And she liked them too. This blind girl also said that the running.. ..feet was that of a male. That means this blind girl can see. Your honour! Who can believe this? She's just come to save her husband by.. ..giving a false witness. - No, no. Whatever I am saying is true. I can't see through eyes but can recognize.. ..by touching things. Is it? You can touch and recognize. Yes. With your permission your honour. Bring your hand. What is this? Glasses. Very good. What is this? A pointed stone. Please, excuse me. Tell me, which finger of mine is the smallest. This is not your hand but that of a lady. No, it's my hand. - No, I know its sister Shanti's hand. Why are you lying and making fun of my blindness? Your honour! I don't understand as to why this blind girl.. ..is being subjected to humiliation to.. ..get the case to be a true one. 'Public prosecutor' has made fun of her.. ..by addressing her repeatedly as blind. I can claim that she's not blind but can see. And her eyes are her husband. With the eyes of her husband she can see all things.. ..and can enjoy them. There's no such thing which an Indian girl.. ..can't see with her husband's eyes. How can this happen? Only that person can understand who knows the depth of a women's heart. Very good. But, your honour. What relation does this lesson hold with law? I didn't understand this. You honour! Recognizing things without seeing is something.. ..what a blind can do in a better way than somebody.. ..who's blessed with vision. I can claim that if she touches the feet of the.. ..person she had met. She'll be able to recognize immediately. Open the door. Hurry up! Oh no! Move away. Leave me. What has happened to you? - Nothing. I am walking straight. Come, please sit. I'll sit. First you go and apply kohl. Come on, go. Go and apply kohl. Bela. Bela. Bela, where are you hiding? Bela. She's hiding here. Bela. My sweetheart, my liver, my heart.. Have you got killed? Now, you and I.. How'll we meet? By the way.. How will you bring her? With whom? Bad, very bad. Sad. Very bad. Gauri, what's this lunacy? If you're not going to eat, will he be released? I've told you. I'll get him to you. That's my responsibility. My desire to drink and eat rests with him, sister. Don't be crazy, Gauri. You're not alone anymore. You've got to care for the unborn too. All right. Drink this milk. Drink it for sure, I'll just come. Vijay! How come you're here at late night? Why are you crying? Come. Come inside. - I've come with some important work. What work? Bela! Oh! Now, I understood. Why are eyes in tears? Vijay, the sacrifice that you're giving today. Must be the first one in the whole world. Enough. Don't praise me. I'll go. Vijay, you've come. Where are the letters? The letters have reached their destination. Where? To sister, Shanti. Oh! To Shanti. You unlucky! You've prepared yourself to be a widow? If I become a widow some woman will.. ..be able to save her husband, at least. Why should she be a widow? Why shouldn't be the wife of a sinner become widow? I, a sinner? You call me a sinner? Not only this. I also would like to save other girls from.. ..becoming your victim. So that they don't become compelled to.. ..suicide like Sheela and Bela did. Wow! As if you've taken the responsibility of all the girls in this world. Tell me the truth, where were you? I told you, I'd gone to sister Shanti. You'd gone to learn, how one enjoys in world. Please, keep quiet. The word enjoyment is meant for men and not women. Your eyes have got covered with sin. That's why you see everybody as a sinner like you. I, a sinner? You call your husband, a sinner? Husband? Husband is the one who only loves his wife. You dare so. Stop! Today, I'll.. Stop! Wait. Where will you run? That's good. You keep sitting with the Goddess. The world may be blind but the Goddess has the eyes. She'll herself do the justice. Thanks, to the Goddess that she saved me from killing you. Hail! To the Goddess. Who's it? Ram Singh! Hariya! Come soon. Ram Singh. - Leave! Leave me or else I'll break your skull. Move. Leave me! Let me go. Hello. Police. - Leave me. 617. Get all the prisoners who are in lock up. They are required for murder identification parade. Ok sir. Hey you! Press the hand and go. Get off the shoes. Sister, Shanti. He's the one. - Move. Get away. Gauri. O God! Blood! Mr. Balam. - Yes please. Do you know the deceased? Pardon! You know the deceased? Actually, I've never heard of any madam with this name. I mean the girl who got killed. I see. Yes, undoubtedly. Even the convict knows her and you too know her. Do you all know the girl? Yes, your honour. Then why was this hidden from the court till today? Your honour! The reason was this that the information about.. ..the deceased we got last night in letters and photo. These are those letters which were written.. ..by the deceased to Balam. How did you get these letters? Vijay, the wife of Balam, herself handed-over them to me. And last night, Balam was arrested from.. ..my house, trying to steal these. From these letters its very evident that.. ..the deceased had intimate relationship with Balam. Balam used to get paid for that relationship. Is it true? Sir, every couple does so. When a male lover can take care of his sweetheart. Then what so big deal in a rich girl doing the same. Your honour! The point is Balam did know the deceased very nicely. And he also knew of her getting killed. Then why did he knowingly keep quite till now? Sir, there's only one reason for me and.. ..the convict to be mute. That means you too are related with this murder. Surely. But not in the manner what you think. Sir. From the day the niece of the convict got married to me. We never got along well. After getting irritated of the day-night quarrel. I did find my solace in Bela's love. The joy that Vijay couldn't give me. I got that from Bela. When the convict got to know this.. ..then for his niece, for whom he can go to any extent. He killed Bela. Sir. Now you must have got the reason of his silence. The convict is an educated man. He doesn't want any stigma on his family or his niece. Convict Balraj, do you agree to what Balam said? Whatever Balam said, I adhere to that. Since the case started the convict has.. ..been saying only one thing. I've killed her. I accept the crime. I adhere to the statement. The convict is not ready to say anything besides this. Your honour! Now, I want to present a witness who.. ..was present at the time when the crime was being committed. Why was this witness not produced till today? That's because, he came into light from the.. ..letters which Bela wrote to Balam. Oh! I see. Proceed. I want to make one more request to the court. Till the time this case gets over.. ..Balam be kept in the court itself. All right. My witness is, Khatpatiya. Proceed. Is it true that the love between Balam and Bela.. ..took place after Balam's marriage? It's not so. They were involved with each other much before. Then how did Bela give the permission to.. ..Balam to marry Vijay? How could the poor know that he's playing a double game? When she came to know of all this.. ..then out of being jealous, she came from the city to the village. Did you see with your eyes Balam killing Bela? Yes I did When I reached the top of the hill. I saw Balam and Bela fighting over there. Bela angrily was showing some letters to Balam. Balam forcibly snatched those letters after reading them. Then Bela got the knife out. Seeing the knife Balam said, 'I see, so you think you can kill me.' Saying this, he pounced on her. Snatching the knife from Bela, he stabbed her in the chest. Then there was a shrill cry. And Bela got rolled down and fell off the hill. Out of fear, I was perspiring. I hid myself behind a cliff. Balam went running in front of me. And my Lord, I did see that his clothes were blood stained. What happened to that knife? Of knife! The knife was with Balam while running. That's all your honour. Now the able 'Public prosecutor' can cross-examine. Thank you. What is your occupation? Actually, nothing. I am unemployed. How do you support yourself? - What? How do you support yourself? My livelihood is on my friends. Is Balam one of your friends? Actually, Balam used to be. What does it mean? - I mean, he's a very miser man. If one asks for twenty, he gives five. And later he stopped that too. I see. That means, when Balam stopped giving you money. You became his enemy and came here to.. ..become a false witness. - No, sir. I swear what I said is true. Then where were you till today? Why didn't you report to the police after the murder? Please see, sir. At that time I thought, after all I am a friend of Balam. I too don't get embroiled in all this. Then how did you think now that you.. ..won't be getting in trouble? Actually.. Ms. Shanti has assured me that she'll save me. Very good! Your honour! Everybody knows that Khatpatiya is an enemy to Balam. The defence counsel took advantage of it. She taught him thoroughly and got.. ..him presented in the court. I'd request the court to take action against.. ..him for being a false witness. Your honour! I didn't teach this witness anything as such. He's just stated what he saw. One can feel the sympathy for innocence.. ..in his statement and not enmity. Seeing an honest man on the verge of being.. ..punished, he's come here to give his statement.. ..taking the assurance of his protection from me. Very good. Your honour! My 'Defence counsel' feels that this vagabond.. ..suddenly started having a soft corner for.. ..this convict and came here as a witness.. ..against his enemy. Your honour! There's still a very important point left to discuss. Till the time the knife and the clothes related.. ..to the incident is recovered, his statement.. ..can't be taken seriously. That's all your honour. You can go. - Can, I! The decision is put on hold till tomorrow. Mother Goddess! At least, you're the one who gives justice. In your court, the truth has always been.. ..victorious and the lie has lost. Mother, protect the innocent. Tell me you'll do. That the truth shall be victorious. Why don't you say? Tell you'll do it. Mother! Say, Goddess. Say, Goddess. Goddess! Say, Goddess. Say, Goddess. Even though the defence counsel has.. ..tried to prove her point very sternly and with courage. That the convict is innocent. And that Balam is responsible for the murder. But the blind daughter of Balam who.. ..happens to be the wife of the convict. Her statement holds no value in the eyes of law. And the friend of Balam, Khatpatiya's.. ..statement is also not a solid one. Nor could the defence counsel get the knife.. ..and stained cloth presented. Besides, the convict is still accepting this crime. In the light of all these, the court, to the convict.. Stop! Stop! - For God's sake, listen to me. Who's this girl? She's the wife of Balam, Vijay. Your honour! Sister, these are the cloths of my husband. And this is the knife, sister. Take this. And save my uncle. Your honour! To raise certain doubts on this mystery, I want.. ..to ask a few questions to the convict. Permission granted. Thank you. - Come, Vijay. Can you surely say that there was nobody.. ..there at the time of murder? Yes, I say so surely. These are the clothes of Balam. How did it get blood stained? Yes, I recall. The time when I was killing that girl.. ..Balam came forward for her help. Your honour! This point, be noted. Were you using the knife to kill? No. Then how did this knife get traces of blood? I don't know this. - You know it very well. You didn't kill the deceased by pushing her. But it was Balam, who killed Bela with this knife. The traces of Bela's blood are present on Balam's cloth. You honour! Besides, the killer's knife and cloth.. ..these are those letters which Balam.. ..wrote addressing Bela. And this is Bela's handbag. Now, there's no doubt over it that.. ..the actual killer of Bela is Balam. And this too is clear as to why was the convict Raj.. ..owning up someone else's crime. That was so as he was none other than the.. ..husband of Raj's niece Raj didn't want that due to this, his niece.. ..Vijay's life gets destroyed. - Shanti! Why are you undoing what I did? Are you the enemy of Vijay's happiness? Do you want that Vijay gets devastated.. ..she becomes a widow? That's enough Mr. Raj. Please stop! - You sit down, Balam! Your honour! This murder has been committed by me. I've done this murder. - No! Sir! I consent that I've done this murder with this knife. The statement of my friend Khatpatiya is correct. In the world, where there's so much of honesty.. ..that to save an innocent, these people.. ..are trying so hard. I don't have the right to stay there. Sir, please punish me. Please, get me executed. Please, punish me. Your honour! It's now proved that the murderer of Bela.. ..is not the convict but Balam. The statement of Khatpatiya is correct. When Bela did try to kill Balam, then.. ..on self-defense, Balam did kill Bela. Your honour! Considering the circumstances.. ..and especially this point. That in the apprehension of the real killer. His own wife has played a vital role.. ..I request the court to sentence a minimum.. ..of the punishment to Balam. Thank you, your honour. What does the prosecution has to say on this? I don't have anything to say, you honour. I do agree to the view of 'Defence counsel'. I hereby free Mr. Balraj. Take Balam in custody. Please, forgive. Please, forgive me. Vijay. Vijay, what is this you're doing? Say once that you've forgiven me. Vijay, who am I to forgive? My body shall get the punishment but.. ..you've saved my soul. No, I am a sinner. Let it be anything. The stain of I getting my husband arrested.. ..shall always remain with me. No, Vijay. You're a Goddess. There might be countless sinful husbands like me. You've saved those girls from their torture. - All right. You let me go. - No. Take me too, along with you. - Vijay! Wherever, you'll be. The place shall be a heaven for me. - Vijay! Vijay. Vijay, I did try my best. But God wanted otherwise. Be brave, Vijay. I assure you that Balam won't be getting.. ..punishment what you think. Balam shall return from the jail as reformed man. He'll be a human being. Then, you shall be happy with him. Vijay. Whatever God does, it's for the good. Right now, Gauri needs us. Come. - Gauri! Where's Gauri? - She's in hospital. Please come. Gauri! You've come! Sister, Gauri. Take care of the one who belongs to you. Gauri, how's your health now? I thank God that you've come. I am fine. What do you see? First, tell him if it's a boy or a girl. He's the kid Raj. Shanti, sister. The kindness you've showered on me. I'll never be able to repay it. You're truly a Goddess. Sister, Gauri. Let me remain, human. If ever you pray for me, pray that.. ..I be on the way of justice. I become the support for the needy. I live for others. All right. Come, Shanti. Ok, Raj.
