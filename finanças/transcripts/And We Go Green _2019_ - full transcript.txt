♪♪ ♪♪ The streets of exotic Hong Kong normally hum to the tune of fossil‐fueled traffic. But this weekend, those streets form a racing circuit for the all‐electric racing series, Formula E. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ‐ How you doing? Pleasure, welcome. - Thank you very much. Great to meet you. ‐ How are you doing? He can roll out, pull out to the bridge. ♪♪ ♪♪ It's Jean‐Éric Vergne on pole position for the Techeetah Team, his fifth pole position... Right here? - Yeah. Here is better. - Okay. - Because like this we don't get the fence. We have the trees, but we don't get the fence. Activation of the start procedure. We are waiting for lights to start the race. And, uh, well, we do have a very long pause here, so I wonder if there is... some kind of issue. ‐ Come on. ‐ What's going on? - Hello? Is there a light problem? But we don't actually have any information. Roger, what the fuck happened? ‐ The lights failed. ‐ Who the fuck is responsible for the lights? ‐ Albon and Rafael. ‐ I'm gonna fucking kill them. Where are they? ‐ Albon was just down there. ‐ Formula E could've been created by two kind of people, either "environmentalists" or racing people. It was created by me, racing guy. But it gets the best of both. The first time I thought about Formula E, I was working in Formula 1. I loved it. I love the world of motor racing. I was trying to amaze this company to become a sponsor of Formula 1, and in every emails they were saying, "We cannot be involved with Formula 1 because it's polluting. "We cannot be involved with Formula 1 because of the CO2. "We cannot be involved with Formula 1 because it's not environmentally‐friendly. We cannot..." And then I thought, "We have a problem." I said, "We need to find a green Formula 1." Because if we can find a green Formula 1, that's where the big business for the future is going to be. I started Formula E with Jean Todt, the president of the FIA, and when we announced it, everyone thought we were gonna go bust. ‐ Everybody thought he was mad. I did. I thought it was‐‐ that it was an impossible task. ‐ The thing is the people... the first impression they have for motor racing‐‐ it's the noise. There's no noise on electric formula. ‐ I was just like, oh, I don't know. I mean, it would be cool if this happened, but... I didn't think that they would have the neck to come out and say the planet is dying and we have to do something. But there's no question that that was the whole premise of the series. ‐ Like I say, I'm not an environmentalist. I'm a racing man, but I do worry about the environment. So if I can put both together... fantastic. Whatever the problems were appear to be resolved. It looks as though we are getting ready to go racing. ‐ 50 seconds. - Ready, ready. ♪♪ ♪♪ And we go green in Hong Kong. It's a good start from Vergne. He's gonna hold the lead on the run down to Tamar Park. ♪♪ ♪♪ The Formula E season is 12 races in the heart of ten of the biggest cities in the world... 20 drivers from 10 teams fighting to be the champion of the season. And this year, season four, starts with two races in Hong Kong. I've driven Formula 1. Now with Formula E, it's the hardest car I've ever had to drive in my life. You go into every braking zone not fully knowing what the car is going to do underneath you. The pure technique of driving an electric car to the limit is much more precise. The throttle response is instantaneous. ‐ Every race is a street track, and street racing is‐‐ is rare. And not only that, it's in the city center, so the margin for mistake is very, very small or none. You are driving flat out, but you are trying to consume as little energy as humanly possible. Uh, Jev has less energy. Start to use more energy. ‐ It's like playing chess at 200 kilometers per hour. Almost every guy in here is a previous F1 driver, which obviously is the top echelon of motorsport. And here comes André Lotterer. This is his first race in Formula E. ‐ This is a total new thing, completely different. Cars are really difficult to drive. So, yeah, it's going to be a steep learning curve. The sound of the engine is usually a speed reference for you when you go through a corner... but that one is gone. But, yeah, I'm pretty excited. André, are you okay? Yeah. Fuck. This is fucking dangerous, man. The Frenchman, Jean‐Éric Vergne, known as Jev, moves into the lead. JEAN‐ÉRIC VERGNE: You need to be aggressive. The moment you decide to relax... instead of going very close to the wall, I'm gonna take, like, 10 centimeters margin‐‐ this is the moment where you get fucked. Jean‐Éric Vergne still leading the way. Sam Bird alongside him. These two were teammates once. A lot of history between those two drivers. ‐ Jev is the most difficult guy to overtake. He won't give an inch. Ooh, hoo‐hoo‐hoo‐hoo! A late, late defense there. With Jev, it's better to maneuver him into an area where he then feels like he's secure... and then strike. Did a little look‐‐ To the inside! There he goes up the inside. Great move from Sam Bird! JEAN‐ÉRIC: Did it, boys. Well done. Sam Bird wins in Hong Kong! There's your winner. Sam Bird for the DS Virgin Racing Team takes victory and the 25 points that come with it. It's second for Jean‐Éric Vergne, 21 points. The driver who wins the most points at the end of 12 races will win the championship. JEAN‐PAUL: Jean‐Éric Vergne is a very special guy. He's just, uh, sometimes a little bit crazy. My sort of nickname for Jev‐‐ I call him a fuckin' nightmare. A lot of journalists will tell you that Jev is really moody, and Jev definitely is an emotional driver. ‐ He's the Frenchest French I know. That says a lot of things about him. Jev was really angry when he first bid in Formula E. He was furious that he'd been dropped from Formula 1, and certainly, it's very good for Jean‐Éric to have a teammate who he can be really close to. So this year you have a new teammate. JEAN‐ÉRIC: Uh, yeah, André, André Lotterer. Obviously, I've heard of him when I was a kid. He's older than me, and, uh, is some sort of legend in sports college. He's won in everything's done, and he's driven everything. Look at his CV. He's driven everything. André was three‐time Le Mans winner. So he was considered the best endurance driver of the planet. Very successful at sports cars. Very successful in Japan. André Lotterer. ‐ He's a super good‐looking guy, and he looks really, really easy‐‐no tension, always smiling. It's his first year in Formula E, so I have no doubt he will be having a tough time. Maybe. ‐ "Hey, are you ignoring me now?" ‐ Which way you going? ‐ I'm sorry. ‐ André, photo. Photo. Superstar. Superstar! ‐ Bonjour! JEAN‐ÉRIC: That's my dad. ‐ Bonsoir! JEAN‐ÉRIC: Okay, let's go, let's meet Papa. ‐ If we continue this way... JEAN‐ÉRIC: We didn't grow up the same way as all the other kids. I was here, I was doing karting, I was preparing the races, I was mounting my chassis, my go‐karts, and then on the weekend, I was gone for racing. JEAN‐ÉRIC: It was very clear to me that I need to give up everything I do and focus hundred percent on the racing. Formula 1‐‐that was my dream, that's what I wanted to do. Why do they all feel like Formula 1 is it? ‐ Because it has been it. Formula 1 is the pinnacle of the sport. It's the most technologically advanced. It's the fastest cars, the most dynamic cars. It's the biggest version of our sport that there is, and drivers, when they're young, it's what they all aspire to. When you were a kid, what was your dream? ‐ Formula 1 driver, obviously, like every kid at the beginning. ‐ Any sport is like a triangle. You've got all these kids down here‐‐ they wanna make it there. That's‐‐that's the thing. When I was growing up, it was Formula 1, and there's 20 guys. So the chance of getting there, to the most exclusive club in the world, is very, very difficult. Sam is the underdog, isn't he? He loves to think of himself as that guy that's, "Yeah, I‐I probably shouldn't be here," which he should‐‐ he's a really good driver. He was fantastic in the category below Formula 1. Then he never kind of quite got that little bit of luck. Most racing drivers are posh. Sam is not. He came up the karting scene and was picked up by talent scouts. The boyhood dream was to win races in Formula 1. Now, that's... that's not gonna happen. There's more chance of me.... going to the moon on a banana. Like, seriously, that's‐‐ that's about as much chance as I've got of being in that world again. And I love what I do. Why‐‐why would I... why would I change my life to be back in that shark‐infested nasty pool? - Gracias. - Gracias. ‐ My favorite. Vegan life. Vegan life is so good. Some drivers, they like the fame of being a racing driver and they‐‐ and their dream is to be in Formula 1. My dream is to race. If I'm gonna race go‐karts the rest of my life and earn my money, I'm happy doing that. Tell me about Nelson Piquet. ‐ Nelson Piquet, Jr? ‐ Junior. ‐ Yeah, junior, absolutely. Nelson Piquet, Jr. I thought you were talking about senior. Good‐looking boy, fast. ♪♪ ♪♪ One of the things with Nelson is that there's another guy called Nelson Piquet‐‐ his dad. Nelson's kind of always been in his shadow. That's my dad's helmet from early '80s. He won three world championships. Geez, it's decomposing. Racing is his life. Nelson will race anything. I'm a pure racer, you know? It doesn't matter if I race Formula E, Formula 1, a... a truck. I love racing. It's Nelson Piquet, Jr. Winning, and his second cup series win. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, that was a win! Yes! Yes, yes, yes! The design of the teardrop runs in our family. It started with my dad's helmet design. You know, it has one over here was the... the stripe that goes around the helmet and then there's another teardrop on the top. So when I won the championship, I did‐‐I did the tattoo of the teardrop, which is on our helmets but was a circuit board inside because of the first electric world champion. ‐ There's so many drivers who are in Formula E for a redemption story... Nelson almost more than anyone. Renault's actions at last year's Singapore grand prix have taken sport to a new low. That's Nelson Piquet‐‐ Oh, big crash! Nelson crashed in Formula 1 so that his teammate had a better chance of taking the title. It was a massive scandal, and by the point that Nelson cleared his name in court, it was too late. He never got another drive in Formula 1. When that happened to you, did you think, like, your racing career was over? ‐ No, I don't know, um... It was nearly a bad dream or something, and I‐I didn't really know what to do. I was just kind of going with the flow, you know. Everybody's telling you to do something, so I mean... you're 21, you're 22. You know? What the hell are you gonna do? When I joined Formula E, it was tough in the beginning because, you know, I had a lot of drivers, like, a little bit against me. They thought that because of problems I had in F1 it would have been bad formally to have me over there. I had guys like Lucas trying to push everything he could to get me out. I'd never seen anything like that in a sport, uh... such a big conspiracy. He was underperforming. He was not performing well, and he was gonna get fired. Somebody said, "Crash on purpose, and you can stay one more year." He was putting his life in danger, maybe the life of other people in danger. Crashing for somebody else to win a race or for you to renew a contract‐‐I would not do it. Lucas di Grassi‐‐ what can I say about him? The guy feels a bit entitled. He's so... arrogant and, uh, he's a little bit condescending to the other drivers. ‐ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11‐‐ This is only half of the Formula E trophies. The other half is in Brazil. ‐ And this is why the others don't like him. I'm different from the other drivers. Racing is part of my life. It's not my whole life. For me, it was, uh, a lifestyle that I wanted to achieve. Lucas likes the image of the professor. He likes the image of somebody who's very technically aware. He is‐‐he's a really, really smart dude. ‐ You designed this? ‐ Yeah, it's my company. ‐ Where's the battery? ‐ The battery stays inside the frame. It has regenerative braking like the Formula E car. I was the first driver to join Formula E with Alejandro. In the first year of Formula E, pretty much all the drivers talked bullshit about Formula E in the very beginning. Say, "Electric‐‐I'm never gonna drive that." They realized later that, uh, this is the future and there's no way of getting around it. If you want to be a professional driver, you need to be where the manufacturers are, and the manufacturers, they want to develop electric cars‐‐ that's why they are in Formula E. This is a‐‐year '91. It's a Testarossa 512. It's a‐‐it's a super classic, yeah. Was my dream car when I was a kid. What about fuel consumption? These cars were like 3 kilometers per liter, something ridiculous, yeah. Electric cars are more efficient. They are better for an environment, and they are better overall. So there is no way back. Right now, the Formula E car goes up to maybe 220 kph, but in five years it has the potential to be the fastest cars on the planet, and the combustion engine will not be able to catch up. ♪♪ ♪♪ The revolution is coming. It's just a question of time. Climate change is real, and people are starting to wake up. Here we are. ♪♪ ♪♪ But one of the biggest things still keeping people from buying electric cars is range anxiety‐‐ basically, people getting nervous that the battery's going to die. So what we're focusing on in Formula E is to make more efficient and longer‐lasting batteries. When we started Formula E, the problem was that in the world, there were no batteries that could, um... feed the energy to a race car for longer than 25 minutes. So we needed the races to last about an hour. We came up with kind of a very simplistic approach. We said let's give two cars to every driver. When they finish the battery of the first car, they jump out and they go to the second car. But always, always our objective was to eliminate that change. Now we are saying next season, season 5, we're gonna do the entire race with just one car. With McLaren, we are working on a new, revolutionary battery that can last the whole race. This is the biggest bet we've done, and we will test it in a few months. And this battery really needs to work, because Mercedes and Porsche have agreed to enter next year's championship because we are going from two cars to one car. ‐ The thing that people need to understand about motorsport is that it has always been an incubator for things that end up in road cars. And there's so many track‐to‐road stories, I mean, disc brakes, seatbelts, deformable crash structures. All kinds of technology was pioneered by the racetrack and has ended up on everybody's road cars. That's why the manufacturers are getting involved because this is a series which is going in the same direction as the automotive industry, which is pivoting towards electric. Imagine, you take a series where the drivers actually have to physically change cars because of range anxiety at the start of the series, but by season five, you've got a battery that will go the whole way through. What an amazing story that would be to tell the world about how this racing series could really accelerate technology. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ JEAN‐ÉRIC: ♪♪ ♪♪ Look at the crowds coming into the circuit at Marrakesh. Lotta celebrities on hand. How about Legolas himself, Orlando Bloom, one of a number of high‐profile personalities on hand this weekend. No pictures‐‐ It's very important to have personalities and celebrities at the races. Having those persons makes it easier to get to the big public. How you doing? A pleasure to meet you. Leo has come every season to a race. I don't know he could be involved with any other kind of motor racing. I remember when I had the first Tesla. It was basically stacks of cell phone batteries, and it would heat up immediately as I went up the hill to my house. ‐ For race cars, we have to design a whole cooling system that is super‐advanced... ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ To cool the battery. And that can be then used for the road cars to make them much better. ‐ Wow. ‐ Yeah, there you go. And so what are concrete actual advancements since starting? ‐ The cars have like a brain... ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ That is the one that coordinates the battery and the electric motor. Every car has the same battery and the same chassis, the same body, but every team develops its own powertrain and its own software. And it basically tells the battery how much energy to send to the electric motor and manages also the temperature. It's a whole kind of management system of the electric powertrain. Those, they take the software from here, they put it on the road car. ‐ So it's no longer mechanics and guys that can essentially make the fastest car. It's almost like a tech race now. ‐ It's a tech race. And actually, that's one of the key elements of competition‐‐ how well they manage the energy, because we want saved energy to be one of the key elements of winning a race. Because the only way to motivate these big companies to develop more and more technologies‐‐ to make them fight against each other to win. Mahindra‐‐ I've heard a lot about them. ‐ Very strong, really strong. ‐ Yeah? ‐ Yeah, they're Indians. A great company from India. They make cars, they make trucks, they make tuk‐tuks. They're one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world. ‐ How are you? In Asia, population is exploding. Pollution in the cities is terrible. So electric cars are a huge deal in Asia. For example, Nio is a young Chinese company that is setting itself up to be a massive producer of electric cars for the Chinese market. Jaguar had never made an electric car before they entered Formula E. It was certainly a good way of announcing that they were gonna make electric cars. Renault were the only manufacturers that came in right at the start. Everyone was a bit like, "Oh, diddling around in Formula E cars, Renault? That's very French of you." JEAN‐PAUL: Everybody was telling us "It will never work," and we said, look, if it works, then you will look like stupid and you will bite your fingers because you didn't follow us right at the beginning. Now Formula E has manufacturers cueing up to make that fastest race car. So there is no question that the technology will be in showrooms in a couple of years. Many people say, "Formula E, electric cars, cool, whatever, but where is the energy coming from?" To really have the full circle, you need to use an electric car, but you need to use it with renewable energy. You see those chimneys there? Yeah. - Those are the generators‐‐no smoke. We looked into using solar energy, but you cannot produce the energy with solar fast enough to charge the cars. We looked also at hydrogen, but the fuel cells, they cannot fly. If you put them on a plane, with a change of pressure, the membrane breaks. We found this glycerin from sea algae and cooking oil called Aquafuel. We could now run a city of about 2,000 homes... - Mm‐hmm. - Only with this. ‐ How does it generate energy? I‐I don't quite understand. ‐ Right. And it uses this. This is the fuel we use, Aquafuel, and the funny thing is, you can taste it. And the generator... almost like a normal generator, but it produces no emissions. ‐ So you don't need to tap into the grid, which goes back to the main problem which is where do you source your energy from? Are you burning coal or‐‐ ‐ Exactly. Fish, you wanna try? ‐ So it's sweet. ‐ Yeah, sweet. ♪♪ ♪♪ Pole position for Sébastien Buemi. Alongside him on the front row is Britain's Sam Bird for the DS Virgin team. And we go green in Marrakesh! It's a good start from Rosenqvist. He cuts towards the inside. Good start from di Grassi as well. ♪♪ ♪♪ ‐ Because of the way the systems work in Formula E with the regenerative braking‐‐ which means that whenever they brake, the batteries charge‐‐ the driver has to learn how to drive that car in a very, very different way than what he would, uh, an internal combustion engine car. Every time you use power, you're taking... little bit out of the battery. But when you regen, you take it out and then you put... a little bit back in. And if you're good at saving the energy, you'll have a little bit more compared to the opposition. It's something that makes it very different, so even though they're the best in the world, they still come in here and they still have to learn how to redrive this car. It's been a steep learning curve. You have to focus so much on the energy. And learning new tracks between these walls, it's like... "Are you ever gonna feel good about this?" Pressure's on, but it doesn't mean I'll change my approach. André, are you okay? ‐ Um... I'm out of power here. Rosenqvist, the Mahindra driver, wins in Marrakesh! I think maybe André did kind of think that Formula E might be easier than it is. I mean, after Marrakesh, did I think André was gonna last the season? Maybe not. Even if you finish badly, you wanna finish the race. To have to walk back along the tra‐‐ I mean, it's just embarrassing. Maybe I should get a press kit? No, no, no. I should have walked back and jumped in the other one, right? Is that legal? ‐ Can you do that? ‐ No, you can't. You need to come here with your first car. ‐ Okay. JEAN‐ÉRIC: Read the rules. - Well, you know, I found this job where I didn't need to study anything, so... ‐ What? How w‐‐ how did you do today? ‐ What I did today was just a perfect days, and, uh, when you do a perfect day that you finish fifth, means you cannot win a championship like this. So... I'm gonna push the team very hard to try and improve it, uh, try and win races because we have to win races if you wanna win a championship. And right now, we're not in position to do so. ‐ But keep the positive attitude. ‐ Actually, no. ‐ No? ‐ Sometimes you need to push the team... ‐ Yeah. ‐ Show the angry face. Because if you look happy all the time, then people think, you know, there is nothing to work on. The sound of victory, right? Yeah. JEAN‐ÉRIC: Great sound. ‐ When you win. ‐ It's good for them. It's a good team. Is it very important for Jev to win in Formula E? When Jev first became in Formula 1, of course, I was very happy. But immediately, I think it would be very difficult because he was not in a good team. We didn't talk together too much because, uh, I think he didn't see the reality. At 20 years old, he have camera right in front of him from everybody and he was losing his head a little bit. Fundamentally, the Red Bull program found him lacking for whatever their reasons are. So they dropped him in the usual way that they do. Once you start being questioned on your skill, once you start being questioned on your commitment, once you get, like, the head of the junior program trash talking you in the press‐‐ which Jev absolutely did, he got called lazy‐‐ and he got hospitalized because you're trying to starve yourself down to your teenage teammate's weight‐‐ like, that's fucked up. Voilà. I don't think that Techeetah has a strong chance of winning the championship. I think they're too small. I think they're a good team and they have good drivers, but I think‐‐I don't think they have the resources to win the championship. ‐ Okay, André, you're probably still... too forward at the moment. We just moved flats because the baby's coming. It's ready. This is the baby room. You already got it. ‐ Yeah, so we are just building up so we have some stuff. Super exciting, actually. I don't have a lot of worries for the future. I think technology will solve a lot of issues. But there are a lot of questions, a lot of problems. Climate change is one. So there'll be a lot of question marks, uh, for my son. When he's 40 or 30, the world will be completely different. How did you get into racing? Was your father a race car driver? No. Growing up in Brazil, there was two things we did during the weekend. We watched football, and we watched Formula 1 'cause of Senna. Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian icon. ♪♪ ♪♪ He was three‐time world champion, and the impact that this guy has on the‐‐on Brazilian people was so huge. When Senna died, Brazil stopped. After that, I started taking racing more seriously. But on top of it, I wanted to impact people in a positive way the same way Senna did. And I can do that by racing. I think my dad had a lot against Senna. They had their rivalry back in the day. In those days, those guys were... in a way, superheroes. I think racing was so cool those days because they sat in cars that were as fast as Formula 1 cars are nowadays, but they were 1/4 of safety. They would lose one or two friends a year. And Senna was one of the last drivers that passed away. My dad didn't race for Brazil. My dad raced for himself. He raced because he loved racing because the money was good, because you had fun. ANNOUNCER And then out goes Piquet! My goodness! My dad, when he didn't like something, didn't like somebody for a reason, that was it. Oh, my goodness! That gave him a lot of bad press at the same time, but my dad didn't care. Those are the kinda things that I did learn from my dad. You get guys like Lucas... I'm not gonna pretend when he comes to a racetrack and take a picture and post something‐‐ "Oh, so great to have you here, my Brazilian friend." You definitely tick a nerve with him. Piquet. Yeah, we have a long history of fight each other. He likes to speak badly about other drivers in the press. So every time he says something bad about myself, I reply. And that creates clash, of course. ‐ I beat him in F3, I beat him in GP2, I took his place in F1. So he got a bit, uh... he got a bit, uh, how you call it, uh... what's the right word, um... Bitter about it. My generation in Brazil when I was a kid was myself, Nelson Piquet, and Bruno Senna. So I had a Senna and a Piquet racing against me. So I never had any sponsorship. All the sponsorship from Brazilian companies‐‐ they would go either to Senna or to Piquet, of course, because of the names. My family does not come from autosports, so I went the hard way. And Nelson, on the contrary, he had everything very easy in his life. The father set up his own team. He never had the pressure that I had. He had a very easy life on this topic, because the father knew exactly how to do it. Obviously, I had my dad's influence. He gave all of us the same opportunity‐‐ you can race if you want to. Here's a go‐kart. Let's see how it goes for a couple of years. And if you notice that you don't love it to your bone, then he said, "Look, this is not your thing. Let's go find something else for you." But I loved racing. So I ended up doing go‐karts with my mechanics. My dad was always working, my mom just taking care of her own life. I probably spent more days with my mechanic than my dad, for sure. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪♪ ♪♪ Ooh ooh ♪♪ ♪♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪♪ ♪♪ Ooh ooh ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ JEAN‐ÉRIC: This city, you see you can barely see the mountain.

How do you feel about how André's been doing? ‐ You know, he's been unlucky so far, uh, not scoring points, but, uh, I know that, for example, in the race in Marrakesh, he was really quick before the car broke down. And, uh, he will be there, you know? He will be as fast as me. I'm very, you know, I'm sure of that. Yeah, but you know, that's motorsport, that's sport as in general.

He lost the control of his car, and‐‐and his car went under the crane. Jules was like the little brother of Jev. They were very, very close. JEAN‐ÉRIC: We grew up together in karting. We were always fighting each other. We were the two French guy that, you know, that were gonna make it to Formula 1. You know, we felt invincible, like nothing can happen to us. And, um... I was the car in front of him, and I nearly had exactly the same thing that he had.

Two things that Alejandro had that made it possible for him to have built the series‐‐ the first is that he is an entrepreneur. But the other thing is that he's an ex‐politician. Motor racing is my second career. So my first career, I always loved politics. This is a compromise... When I was 25, I was one of the three aides of the prime minister of Spain. 28, I got elected. I was the youngest member of European Parliament ever. That is when I met my wife. Her father at the time was prime minister, so she was the daughter of my boss. Very quickly, I realized that I had to choose between my political career or my future wife. Then I stopped politics. I resigned from all my positions. But having had a past in politics can help you for any profession you do. Okay, bye. To negotiate a city center circuit, you talk to politicians, and that's something that Alejandro can absolutely do. ♪♪ ♪♪ There had been no racing in Rome for a really long time... certainly no racing in the city center.

Thank you. No, no, no. Sometimes I try to find a reason why Formula E has had this really fast growth. So I got inspired by this thought. Haven't you noticed how much the people that travel back in time worry about the consequences of what they do when they are in the past that happen in the present? I haven't met anyone that went back in time. But I have seen a few movies that people go back in time. I mean, I can think of two right now. One is obviously "Back to the Future." The other one is "The Hot Tub Time Machine," which I... think that many of you have seen, but it's pretty good, actually. But nobody really thinks the huge consequences that what we do today can have in the future. And I always go to the optimistic view. If something good happens now, then it can have huge consequences for the future. And we go green in Rome! ♪♪ ♪♪ Rome sold out in five minutes. More and more people were trying to pack crowd every available corner... Ah! For every person who says nobody wants to go to this, nobody wants to watch it, Rome was like a massive smack in the face. It looks like it's going to be Sam Bird as he takes victory in the first Rome ePrix. Sam Bird! Sam Bird surprises again. He's going to launch himself up into second place and the championship! Sam Bird is as good as the... kind of the lower category of drivers in Formula 1. But he was in contention for the championship in the junior categories that would have really put him on the map. And he had a bit of a meltdown. Sam Bird's been taken out by Oliver Turvey! This is to stop Sam. There's Sam‐‐he's distraught. He's absolutely distraught.

But it's not like they're gonna give me Lewis Hamilton or Michael Schumacher's car‐‐ "Just go on, then. You‐‐you race this one." So I was the reserve. I would go to every race. I'd do the simulator back in Brackley‐‐ What did you do during the races? ‐ I drunk so much coffee every race weekend. I was the Chief Coffee Drinker in Mercedes Formula 1.

Championship leader Jean‐Éric Vergne on pole position. Sam Bird right behind in the number two spot. And we go green in Paris! And André Lotterer is causing trouble for Sam Bird from the start. Seven laps complete here in Paris, Jean‐Éric Vergne and Sam Bird have pulled away by over a second over André Lotterer. Lotterer may not be close enough to make a pass, but he's certainly close enough to fill up Sam Bird's mirrors. Look how close Lotterer is. He's right there. That's a bold move from André Lotterer.

And it is Jean‐Éric Vergne, the Parisian leading the way on a four‐second margin over André Lotterer in second place. And Lucas di Grassi is in third. But now here comes di Grassi. Lotterer does not want to let di Grassi through. He's bumping into di Grassi! Lotterer's protecting his teammate, I think, at this point. Going into the final lap. Di Grassi has got more energy. Can Lotterer even make it to the end because he's got such little energy remaining! Did Lotterer run out of energy? Jean‐Éric Vergne! The Parisian wins in Paris!

JEAN‐ÉRIC: People tell me they impressed to see me being calm and everything, but the truth is, I'm fucking dead right now. I'm wasted. But you have to keep pushing. Welcome to Zurich, race 10 of 12. It's time for qualifying. It's all about the fastest lap to decide which driver will start at the front of the grid for the race. You get one lap up to get that pole position. The pole position in most sport, and the end of the day, you start the furthest forward. You are ahead from the very start of the race. So here comes Jean‐Éric Vergne, the master of sticking that car on pole. Jev has always been good at taking poles in Formula E, but he's an emotional driver. Jean‐Éric Vergne, the man with eight pole positions in Formula E to his name. This is his qualifying run, and the rear wheel is getting off the ground as he swings into the first corner. ...right up against the wall. He's slower than Felix Rosenqvist, though, in sector one. Also slower than Daniel Abt. Very uncharacteristic for Vergne. ♪♪ ♪♪ Across the line comes the Frenchman half a second behind Sam Bird. Can't see him starting in the top ten with that.

It's Mitch Evans on pole position, Lotterer alongside him on the front row. Third place man is Sam Bird. He trails 17th place man Jean‐Éric Vergne by... I'm sure it was very frustrating for Jev.

Di Grassi wins the first motor race in Switzerland for 64 years! Sam Bird across the line in second. It's tenth place for Jean‐Éric Vergne. He had a 40‐point lead at the top of the championship.
