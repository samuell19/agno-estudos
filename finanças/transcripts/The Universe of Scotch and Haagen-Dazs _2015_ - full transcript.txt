Penelope? Pen? - What? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing. - Can you get me water? - Shit. - Shh. - Are you me? - I'll explain. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Shall we? Do you have any ice cream? In my universe, they banned sugar. I can afford it on the black market, but-- - There's some Butter Pecan but it might be a little icy. I was hoping for Haagen-Dasz, but thanks. Anyway, I'm a you from another universe. One of the many yous from many, many universes. I, Dan Levy, had invented a way to travel between these universes to visit the literally infinite versions of you, me, Dan Levy. - Sure, the universe is so vast with so many possibilities that there could be-- - Is. - Is, a universe for each and every decision I've ever made. - Or will make. Right, I've devoted my life to mes, hearing those stories and decisions and most relevantly, arranging an exchange program. - So I'd go live in another universe? - For a while, and another you would live here, like a timeshare. - You're gonna charge me for this? - Yeah, and I killed the guy who decided to do this pro bono, so don't wait around for him I'm joking. About killing him, he really does exist. Although yeah, there'd be a universe where I killed him. And one where he killed me. Fuck. - Sure could use some scotch to wash down this ice cream. - I don't drink scotch anymore, bad experience. - Dammit, anyway let's talk about your options. - So I'd be a different Dan Levy. - Well, sort of. - What? - Cool right? iPad invisible three, I'm from a universe where Gore won, 9/11 didn't happen, all the Iraq war money went to cancer research, Steve Jobs lives and now we have this. Though, don't get too excited, there are a whole bunch of universes where we are really sorry Saddam Hussein is still in power. Frankly, there are a bunch of universes where we're sorry Steve Jobs is in power. So there are universes where, you went to grad school. Universes where you went to Spain to teach ESL. Where you went to Spain to be a matador. Where you smoke a lot of weed. Where you deal a lot of weed. Where you do a lot of weeding. Universes where you know kung fu. Where you want to kill yourself. - Dark. - Not as dark as the universes where you did. Universes where you saved the president's life. Where you saved Christmas. Where you saved the life of a little boy, who would become the next Hitler. - Why would I wanna go to that universe? - That's a question only you can answer. - Universes where-- - I'll do it. - What, the Hitler one? - It doesn't matter. I mean, I'd prefer, not the Hitler one but-- - Nice! All right, so it's a $1000, cash upon return. - That's it? - Hey man, we're family, plus the dollar's pretty strong in my universe. That is all pretty standard stuff you're signing, guaranteeing payment, liability. Couple of weird things you should know. I can put you in a universe where the Lost finale doesn't suck. And I can put you in a universe where the Star Wars prequels don't suck, but we still haven't found a universe where they both don't suck. - That's fucked up. - Yeah, I know, there's a lot I don't understand about science. I could put you in a universe where you're still married to Penelope. Or I could put you elsewhere, but either way you'll have to sign a standard Dan Levy gets to fuck my wife waiver. But he'll sign one for you, the you who comes here. No, trust me, no one even notices, least of all her. Don't think about that too much. And most important, don't step on anything. The slightest change to the environment, even a crushed blade of grass could cause irreparable harm to the future. - Really? - No, Sci-Fi humor. But, you know, we respect an honor code. Like, don't quit your job because it's gonna blow up stuff for the Dan Levy who lives there. Or, you know, don't cheat on your new universe's Penelope. But he'll do the same for you, the other Dan Levy, same team. Then, we just pick a day. - No, now. - My man. So many moments where something else could have happened, did happen. You'll get to live in one. All right, spin the wheel, see where it lands. - I wanna be taller. - Me, but taller, I'd like to be taller. - Dan, that's not how this works. In some universes we swap you in and it's just, "Dan looks great, he must have lost some weight". Or, "Dan looks like crap he must have lost some hair." But taller? Tall Dans are, they're really different Dans. - Well that, that sucks. - Not our fault though, they're the universes where mom breastfed us. Man, those tall guys are the worst. So damn happy, just way up there. I'm like, "Hey, you wanna try another uni?" Nope, I did my Lost, Star Wars thing, you know what they said? Literally, all of them, "They're not that bad. "Stop being so cynical, little Dan." - And they sound like dicks. - Yeah, but they're not. Some of them cooked for me, some of them keep in touch, fuckers. - Usually, I'm the snorer. It always keeps her up, but she's so nice to me about it. I don't do anything to fix it, I need to fix it. She started snoring when she got pregnant. And I still haven't told her she does it. Are you happy? Is there any universe where we just, just choose to be happy? I'm going back to bed, I'll pay you the money of course. - What the hell, this will be the universe where I tear up the paperwork. You know, there's a universe where you go. - Yeah, I hope he's happy too. - You want me to check back in? Next year? - I think I'm okay. But if you wanna come by, say hello or whatever, I promise I'll have scotch and Haagen-Dasz ready to go. From now on this will be the universe where I always have scotch and Haagen-Dasz. - Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Dan. - Hey, Penelope, we're gonna breastfeed, right? - That isn't even a question. Just protect me from your mother's judgment. - Deal. Hey. - You're you, right? - No, I'm not me, I'm a fucking whale with an alien kicking my ribs all the time. - There are so many universes that billions of you are making decisions differently than the version of you that's here with me. - Well, fuck those guys. - Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.
