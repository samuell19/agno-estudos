- HAPPY HOLIDAYS, EVERYBODY! COME TO MENKLE'S TOY STORE. ENJOY EVERYTHING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS TO OFFER. - WOW, MR. MENKLE, IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CHRISTMAS PARADE IS A HUGE SUCCESS! - NO, NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. - YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE MY UNCLE. YOU SEE, HIS BUSINESS IS FAILING, AND IF HE DOESN'T SELL ENOUGH TOYS THIS CHRISTMAS, HE'LL LOSE THE STORE. - NO WONDER HE'S A LITTLE CRABBY. - IT'S WORSE THAN YOU THINK. SOMETHING'S REALLY CHANGED HIM THIS YEAR. - VELMA! DAPHNE! OVER HERE! - CANDY CANE! CANDY CANE! OHH! HUH? - LIKE, HURRY UP, SCOOB. MY STOMACH IS CRAVING TO UNWRAP THIS CRAZY CHRISTMAS SNACKAGE PACKAGE. CHRISTMAS-ALICIOUS! - I HOPE THAT WAS MY STOMACH TRYING TO SAY THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK SO. LOOK! - AAH! - AAH! - AAH! - HMM? - HUH? - AAH! SCOOBY-DOO, NO! LIKE, I'LL SAVE YOU, PAL. - THIS WAY! INSIDE! WE'LL BE SAFE! - OH, MY GOSH! HOO HOO HOO HOO! YAAH! OHH! OHHH! WHOO. - HUH? - BBBLLLL! - WHAT WAS THAT THING, FABIAN? - SOMETHING TERRIBLE. - NO. SOMETHING SINISTER. THE SINISTER SNOWMAN. THAT PARADE WAS OUR LAST HOPE. WITH THAT THING OUT THERE, WE'LL HAVE TO CLOSE THE STORE AND CANCEL CHRISTMAS. LOOK, I GOTTA CHECK ON MY UNCLE. EVERYBODY STAY RIGHT HERE. YOU'LL BE SAFE. JUST DON'T GO OUTSIDE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING. I HATE CHRISTMAS. - OH, DUDE, LIKE THAT IS SO WRONG. - YEAH. CHRISTMAS IS WONDERFUL. - I'M AN ACTOR! I HATE IT! EVERY YEAR I GOTTA RIDE THAT FLOAT AND WAVE AND BE HAPPY AND JOLLY AND SAY "HO HO HO!" OHH, IT MAKES ME SICK. I AM SO OUTTA HERE! - NO, WAIT! - DON'T GO OUT THERE. - I WAS THE VOICE OF DIGNITY SMIRDLE. I STUDIED UNDER THE GREAT SUNDERMAN. NO! NO! STAY AWAY FROM ME! NO-- - WOLFIE, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. - DAPHNE'S RIGHT. WITH THAT BLIZZARD OUT THERE AND WHATEVER'S IN IT, WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS MYSTERY. - YEAH, LIKE WE CAN'T LET 'EM CLOSE THE STORE. - OR CANCEL CHRISTMAS. - WHICH IS WHY WE'RE GONNA TALK TO FABIAN'S UNCLE. - HAVROS MENKLE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF US NOT PRESENT WHEN THE SNOWMAN ATTACKED. - MAKING HIM A PERSON OF INTEREST. - HEY, WHAT'S THAT? - THE BACK OF THE GLOCKENSPIEL. WE MUST BE IN THE CLOCK TOWER. - EXCUSE US, MR. MENKLE? WE'D LIKE TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND-- - GET OUT. GET OUT! DOOMED. DOOMED, I SAY. GET OUT! - AAH! - I WANTED TO WARN YOU NOT TO BOTHER MY UNCLE. WHEN I TALKED TO HIM, HE WAS ACTING VERY STRANGELY. - STRANGELY SUSPICIOUS. - I HOPE YOU WEREN'T THINKIN' ABOUT LEAVIN', 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T. NONE OF US CAN. THE BLIZZARD'S GOT US ALL SNOWED IN, AND ALL THE PHONES ARE DEAD. NOBODY'S COMING TO SAVE US. SO YOU KIDS HAD BETTER WATCH YOUR BACKS. - THANK YOU, CLETE. CLETE'S OUR CLEANUP MAN. HE'S HARMLESS, I THINK. - YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, FABIAN, IT'S MORE THAN TOY SALES THAT'S BOTHERING YOUR UNCLE. - I KNOW. IT'S THE CURSE. - IT'S VLADIMAR HARSTICORE. - WHOSI-HARTSIT-WHATSIT? - I THINK IT'S TIME I TOLD YOU ABOUT VLADIMAR HARSTICORE AND THE CURSE OF THE SINISTER SNOWMAN. HE WAS A MEAN OLD MAN WHO WATCHED WITH CONTEMPT AS THE CITY GREW AROUND HIM. HE HATED PEOPLE AND WANTED ONLY TO BE LEFT ALONE. THEN HIS WORST NIGHTMARE HAPPENED. MY UNCLE BUILT THE MENKLE'S TOY STORE BUILDING WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS GLOCKENSPIEL RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. IT DROVE HIM TO A BITTER MADNESS. LEGEND HAS IT THAT HE BECAME PURE HATE, VANISHING IN A FLURRY OF SNOW AND BITTERNESS, TO FORM A SNOWMAN WITH A SINISTER, EVIL SOUL. IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO TODAY THAT HE JUST VANISHED. THAT SAME NIGHT THE GIANT CLOCK STOPPED, AND IT'S NEVER WORKED SINCE. NOW, VLADIMAR HAS RETURNED. HE'S POSSESSED MY UNCLE HAVROS. IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER. THE CURSE OF THE SINISTER SNOWMAN WILL FINALLY DESTROY OUR FAMILY'S TOY STORE. - ALL RIGHT, GANG, GEAR UP. WE HAVE A MYSTERY TO SOLVE. - HMM. - THE IS ASCOT ONE. YARD IS CLEAR. REPEAT, NO SINISTER SNOWMAN IN SIGHT. YOU READ ME, GLASSES GIRL? - FRED, WE'RE STANDING RIGHT HERE. - LIKE, CAN WE GO NOW? - YEAH, LET'S CHECK OUT THE MANSION. - NO! I MEANT LIKE HOME. CAN WE GO HOME NOW? - IT'S LIKE SOME KIND OF WINTER WOEFUL LAND. OOH. - ALL RIGHT, GANG, TIME TO SPLIT UP AND LOOK FOR CLUES. - LIKE, WE VOTE WE DON'T SPLIT UP. - YEAH. SCARY STUFF ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN WE SPLIT UP. THEY NEVER LISTEN TO US. - SOMETIMES I THINK THEY KEEP US AROUND BECAUSE WE MAKE THEM LOOK SMART. - AND WE EAT ALL THE LEFTOVERS. MMM! LEFTOVERS! - STOP TALKING ABOUT FOOD AND GO CHECK THE BASEMENT. DAPHNE AND I ARE CHECKING THE ATTIC. HOLD THE PHONE! ROCKETS! I LOVE ROCKETS. CAN I KEEP THEM, DAPHNE? CAN I? CAN I? - NO, FREDERICK JONES, YOU CANNOT KEEP THEM. THEY'RE EVIDENCE. BUT OF WHAT I'M NOT SURE. - SILVER IODIDE? - DON'T THEY USE THAT TO FREEZE CLOUDS AND MAKE RAIN? - HUH? WHAT? - OH--WHOA! HUH? LOOK, SCOOB, MINIATURE TRAIN TRACKS. DID THAT VLADIMAR GUY SOUND LIKE SOMEONE WHO LIKED TO PLAY WITH TOY TRAINS? - NO. WAIT. HMM? HEY, CHECK THIS OUT. I'M A SCARY MONSTER! BBBLLLL! - HOO HOO HOO! AHEM. WHOO... I'M A SCARY MONSTER, TOO. BBBLLLL! - OOH! OOH-OOH! LIKE, RUN, SCOOBY-DOO! RUN! - AAH! WHAT? AAH! - A POSTCARD? "YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN." JINKIES. - AAAH! - AH! - UHH! - MY GLASSES! I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING WITHOUT MY GLASSES. - NOW I WISH I COULDN'T SEE AT ALL. - HUH? - AAH! - HUH? - HUH? - HEY, SNOWBALL, CATCH! - AAH! - AAH! - HE'S FROZEN US INSIDE. - THAT LEAVES US ONLY ONE THING TO DO. - ORDER A PIZZA? - YEAH. WITH DOUBLE ANCHOVIES AND PINEAPPLE. - NOT EXACTLY. - WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TRAP HIM. - SHAGGY, SCOOBY, YOU TWO STAND GUARD WHILE WE GET TO WORK. - WHY CAN'T WE JUST DO SCOOBY'S IDEA? - ALL RIGHT, ACCORDING TO THESE BLUEPRINTS, THE TOY STORE'S OLD BOILER ROOM WOULD BE THE PERFECT PLACE TO TRAP THE SNOWMAN. NOW, IF WE COULD ONLY FIGURE OUT A WAY TO LURE HIM THERE. - BUT HOW IS THAT GOING TO SAVE MY UNCLE IF HE'S BEEN POSSESSED? - FABIAN, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOUR UNCLE ISN'T POSSESSED. WE THINK THERE'S SOMETHING FAR MORE REAL BEHIND WHAT'S GOING ON THAN GHOSTS AND SPIRITS. - IT IS TIME, CLETE. FINISH THIS. - THIS IS A GENIUS IDEA, SCOOB. NO SINISTER SNOWMAN'S GONNA COME IN HERE IF HE THINKS THERE'S A WHOLE ARMY OF GUARDS. - UH-OH. - FUZZFACE TO ASCOT ONE. MR. FREEZE HAS ENTERED THE BUILDING! - DON'T WORRY, FUZZFACE. WE HAVE A PLAN. - OH! - AAH! - LIKE, FUZZFACE TO ASCOT BOY, COME IN. IS THE TRAP READY YET? IT'S ALL CLEAR DOWN HERE. - FUZZFACE TO ASCOT BOY. COME IN. - HUH? - AAH! - AAH! - RUN! WHOA! OOH! - HEY, IT'S THE SANTA GUY. - OH, DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - WELL, THIS IS SANTA'S VILLAGE. - YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. - I SENSED THE TOY STORE WAS IN TROUBLE. - DUDE, YOU HAVE NO IDEA. - OH! I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. - QUICK! INTO THE TOYS! - SCOOBY-DOO, GET OUT OF THERE! - QUICK! GO ON! SAVE YOUR FRIENDS. - WHOAAA! OOF! - OOH! - OH, GOOD GRACIOUS. OH. - THIS WAY. - HELP! SOMEBODY! EVERYBODY! HELP! - OH. IF I CAN GET THE GLOCKENSPIEL WORKING, SOMEONE WILL NOTICE US. - UHH! WE HAVE TO FIND SHAGGY AND SCOOBY. - I THINK I'VE FIXED IT. - OH! - OH! - RUN, NORVILLE! RUN, SCOOBY! HUH? - OOH-OOH-OHH! - AAH! - LIKE, HAPPY HOLIDAYS, OLD PAL. - SEASON'S GREETINGS. - WE HEARD THE GLOCKENSPIEL. - YOU TWO CAPTURED THE SINISTER SNOWMAN. - HOO HOO. LIKE, NOT EXACTLY. - BUT CLOSE ENOUGH. - NOW LET'S SEE WHO HE REALLY IS. FABIAN MENKLE?! - I KNEW IT. MONEY HAS BEEN MISSING FROM THE STORE'S ACCOUNTS. I WAS BESIDE MYSELF TRYING TO FIND IT. ONLY TONIGHT DID I DISCOVER THAT MY OWN NEPHEW HAS BEEN STEALING FROM ME TO FINANCE THIS CHARADE. - THAT'S WHEN MR. MENKLE SENT ME TO GET THE POLICE. - WELL, WE KIND OF KNEW IT, TOO. WE DID MANAGE TO FIGURE OUT QUITE A BIT. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU USED THE SILVER IODIDE AND THE ROCKETS TO LACE THE CLOUDS AND CAUSE THE SNOWSTORM. - AND, LIKE, HE USED THE REMOTE CONTROL SNOWMAN ON MINIATURE TRAIN TRACKS. THAT'S HOW YOU COULD BE WITH FRED DURING THE FIRST ATTACK. AND OF COURSE YOU CREATED YOUR TERRIBLE FROST WITH LIQUID NITROGEN. ADD TO THAT SOME AND YOU COULD SHAPE-SHIFT AS WELL. - YOU TRIED TO RUIN THE BUSINESS AND MAKE ME LOOK CRAZY. - THAT'S RIGHT, DEAR UNCLE. IF I COULD MAKE YOU DISAPPEAR, I COULD SELL THE STORE AND GET ALL THE MONEY. ALL I HAD TO DO WAS BLAME IT ON THE LEGEND OF VLADIMAR HARSTICORE. - WHICH MAY NOT BE QUITE THE LEGEND YOU THINK. I FOUND THIS POSTCARD VLADIMAR SENT BACK TO HIS HIRED HELP. HE VANISHED ALL RIGHT, TO A BUNGALOW ON MIAMI BEACH. - YEAH, WELL, I STILL WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH THIS IF IT WERE FOR YOU MEDDLING MYSTERY-SOLVERS AND YOUR CHRISTMAS CRAZY DOG! - ONLY ONE MORE MYSTERY. HOW DID YOU TWO GET THE CHRISTMAS GLOCKENSPIEL TO WORK? IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR YEARS. - WE DIDN'T. THE GUY PLAYING SANTA DID. - YOU MEAN HIM? - IT WAS THE SNOWMAN, I TELL YOU. NOW GET ME OUT OF THIS GERM-INFESTED RECEPTACLE! I AM AN ACTOR! - THAT ANGRY DUDE WASN'T SANTA. - HO HO HO HO HO HO! - I CAN'T THANK YOU KIDS ENOUGH. YOU SAVED ME AND MY TOY STORE. LOOK AT ALL THOSE SMILING FACES. IT'S ALL I EVER WANTED. - I HAVE TO SAY, MR. MENKLE, WE LOVE YOUR TOY STORE. - BUT WE LOVE YOUR SANTA EVEN MORE. - THERE YOU GO, LITTLE DUDE. NOW TELL SANTA CLAUS EVERYTHING YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS. - MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU AND SCOOBY DOOBY DOO! HEE HEE HEE HEE!
