And, did you do it? No. Something always came up. Some dreams are meant to stay dreams. But someday I'll do it, I swear. I'm Paul, and I'm moving in here, as you can see. I didn't really know the town. I'd lived in Berlin all my life. I ran off, for good. I didn't want anyone to know I was here. Why did I end up here? No idea. I just pointed somewhere on the map without looking. Excuse me, I'm looking for fresh figs. We don't have any. Where could I find some? I have no idea. Nobody buys them. What do you want them for? For Zabaione. It's a dessert. What for? Never mind. I'd have rather gone someplace by the ocean. The light's red! But it could have been much worse. You can probably be happy without fresh figs, Thai basil, and salsiccia. You just have to get used to it. I worked as a security consultant for various e-commerce companies. I tried to hack into their online-shops and order without a valid credit card. Then I sent them reports on the holes in their security. I made good money. And I felt I was doing something useful without dealing with too many people, which was important. Why do you constantly let people take advantage of you? That's stupid! Take what you want and stop whining. It gets on people's nerves. I know. What should I do? Take the initiative. God, we're not in school anymore! I can't always be there and take care of things for you! Why not? Why not? Because you have to get by on your own. Quit grinning. Quiet out there! But we're going on our trip together, just so you know that. But first we have to get this behind us. "Vive la France!" Stefan! Stefan? That evening, I saw her for the first time. You know how you can look at a picture and wonder if that's really you? You know? That's all so far away. This all just can't be, can it? Come on. Do you understand it? No. It defies understanding. It defies understanding. Shit! Hey, Hans. I'm an actor. Morning. I'm late, sorry. No rush. Benny's mother called. He has a fever and can't come. Nice of Benny's mother. Your mother called, too. She's out of the hospital. I told her you'd call. Everything okay? Everything okay. They say what you dream the first night in a new apartment comes true. But what if you don't dream at all? "Dear Herr Berger, Thank you for your final report. I look forward to working with you again in the future. Thank you and till then.” Signed, A. S. Nice. Hello? Hi, Mama. No, not at all. I'm doing the dishes. What's up? With Papa? Why, what happened? Have you been drinking again, Mama? Have you been drinking? No, I'm not making accusations. No, but I told you I wouldn't talk about Papa when you've been drinking. Yes, I know! Okay, I'm listening. Ever since I'd first seen her, I felt connected to her in an odd way. Her sad face suddenly seemed like my business. Maybe it was just courage from afar. Come on! Come on! Shit! Leave me alone with your problems. I'm not home! And here's your change. Say hello to your mother. She's already gone to work. Some little guy, huh? Papa! Hey. Well, sweetie, how was it? What did you do today? Painted. Painted! Hey! Get your things. Have you noticed that Lara has trouble recognizing colors? No. You know "I see something you don't?" Yes. Maybe you can play that. And pay special attention to blue and green. Okay, then. See you next week. Yeah, see you then. Bye. Bye, Lara! Say bye! Very nice. Thank you. If you like it, I'm giving a concert here on the 25th. Why don't you come by? I'd love to. And tell your friends. I enjoy having young people here. When I was three, my father let me touch his organ for the first time. I was on his lap and could barely reach the keys. I still find it amazing that just one finger can produce such incredible sound. DEAR MAMA, I'M SORRY I WAS IN SUCH A BAD MOOD YESTERDAY… Shit! Oh, damn! WHAT… …HAPPENED? I BURNED DINNER. SHIT! Hello? This is Wolfgang Thormann, Lara's dad. Oh, hello. Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to ask about Lara. When I picked her up, you seemed… worried somehow. Worried? No, you misinterpreted that. Everything's okay with Lara. Really? Really. So I must have misunderstood, then. Yes. Herr Thormann, no offense, but… I'd prefer to deal with such matters through the office. Oh, yes, of course. Excuse me. I just was a bit unsure. Thank you again. Have a nice evening and sorry to bother you. That's okay. No problem. Have a nice evening, too. Okay, till next week, then. Okay, bye. Bye. Hello? Though I didn't even know her name, I knew I was no longer alone in this city. It's absurd, But I wasn't sure if I liked the thought. I'd been tired for weeks. And yet, still I couldn't sleep. You long for something, yet something in you prevents you from pursuing that longing. It's weird. Do you understand it? It defies understanding. Hello. Get up. GOOD EVENING! THANKS, SAME TO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT YESTERDAY? OH WELL. AND YOU? WASN'T HUNGRY THAT'S NOT GOOD NEW HERE? YES! WELCOME THANK YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW? WHAT ABOUT YOU? Hello? Hello. It's easier this way. Are you sure? So, what did you cook today? Nothing yet. The shock still runs too deep, huh? How long have you been here? For one week. That's all? I'm from Berlin. Wow. Why move from Berlin to Paderborn? Gee, all these questions. Tell me if I get on your nerves. No, not at all. Go ahead and ask. No idea. Maybe I just wanted to go someplace different. I thought of moving near the ocean, but it just happened this way. No, I came here for work. Three years ago. But it's okay here. With kids. No, I'm a therapist. Uh oh… Help! What? I'm Paul. Nele. Hello? Hello. Hello. Can I speak to you for a minute? Yes, but just for a minute. I want to apologize again for calling the other night. I wasn't thinking. But, maybe… I'd like to speak to you about Lara. Sure. That's fine. I guess I just I don't know enough about what you do here. She's my daughter, after all. Now's not the best time. Of course. Just tell me when is good. I'm not sure, but… Let's do it when you come with Lara next week, okay? Okay. Thanks. See you next week. And please don't worry about calling. Okay. Bye. Hello. Hey, what was that all about? Why? The way he was staring at you. He wanted an appointment. I guess you could call it that. What? Paul? Can I use your phone? Can I help you? Hans! Come here! Excuse him, he thinks he's an actor. Yes? Hello, Nele. Paul? Sorry to bother you. I locked myself out. Do you have a phone book? Of course. Thank you. Would you like some tea? Please don't bother. I just made some. Okay, then, thanks. Paul Berger speaking. I have a problem. I locked myself out. Just pulled shut. Rolandstrasse 5, second floor. Yes. Fine. Yes, thank you. Goodbye. He'll be here in half an hour. Good, then you have time for some tea. Had no time to throw them out yet. Sugar? Yes, please. Just throw it over there. Thanks. Have you gotten a new commission yet? Not yet, but I'm okay with that. One job a month is enough. I have more time to get settled. And, how do you like it here up to now? Come, be honest. No need to spare my feelings, I'm not from here. It's nice. Really. I haven't seen so much yet, but… If a person wants to be left alone… I guess so. And why do you want to be left alone? I don't know. What's up with the boy next door? Hans? I saw him in the supermarket, and again now. A bit strange, isn't he? With a mother like that… It's a miracle he's as normal as he is. Why? What's going on with them? Never mind. I don't know. She could tell. She knew there were things I didn't want to talk about. At that moment, I knew that she wasn't so different in that respect. I knew that she knew I knew. Some moments are like that. Those are moments you don't easily forget. Do you have any milk? I think the key guy just arrived. Shit! Thanks for the tea. Hurry! Stop! What? No, not you! He'll be down in a minute. Here, you forgot this. Oh, right. Did everything work out with the key? Yes, I had just left it inside. Want to come in? I could make dinner. Some other time maybe. Take care. You, too. And thanks again. Cooking is the best activity when you want to think. For me, at least. Maybe because you use all your senses. I read that somewhere. Suddenly I liked the idea of no longer being alone here. I was sure Nele wouldn't ask too many questions. She would accept things. SLEEP WELL! It was a little toy car. That's sweet. Yes, it is. And? Nothing and. He's a nice guy, what else? And Thormann? Thormann? Come, what he wants is pretty clear. Why? He's just worried about his daughter. That's normal enough. If you say so. Oh, stop it! The way he was hitting on you… You'd have to be blind not to notice. Nonsense! I was next door and noticed! He's a normal, concerned father having problems with his daughter. Okay. And Paul? What's up with Paul? Rita! That's good. Really good. Where did you learn that? My father was an organist. I used to sit on his lap as a child. I sneaked into the church to practice. But always secretly. I didn't want my parents to know. Why? You're talented. That's what they said, too. But then they would have made me take lessons. And I wanted to play, not practice. I wasn't very disciplined as a child. And you regret that today? You're exceptionally talented. You could have gotten far. I mean that. Maybe. But it's too late now. Stefan! It's a pity. That's all so far away. I always thought I was the stronger of us two. You are. I have to get out of here, Paul. I can't stand it anymore. It's not for much longer. And then it's "Vive la France." Yeah. "Vive la France." FEEL LIKE SOME CANNELLONI? Do I feel like Cannelloni? Delicious. Thanks. It's really easy, actually. Don't be so modest. No, really. That's what's great about Italian food. The right pasta, the right ingredients, and presto. Granted, finding the right stuff isn't easy, but I have time. And then? And then? The recipe. Saute the garlic and onions in good olive oil till soft. Then add some brandy. Then add cubed fresh and canned tomatoes, finely cubed zucchini, and very finely chopped fennel salami. That has to cook a while before you add some cream. When the pasta is done, take the sauce off the burner, fill the cannelloni, and bake it all in the oven with cheese. The fresh ingredients are important. That starts with the tomatoes. Those mutant tomatoes from Holland don't taste of anything. I probably couldn't tell the difference. So cooking is your hobby? Oh, it's more a necessity. I like my food to taste good. My mother cooked every day, for my father, my brother, and me. Every day, even though she worked. I don't think that would be much fun. Maybe that's why I cook so rarely, because of those memories. She didn't cook well? Yes, she did. Mine didn't. Your parents don't live here? No, but I don't feel like talking about my parents today. You know how it is when your idea of your family begins to fall apart? When the marriage you thought was perfect turns out to have been a lie? You believe in something. A foundation, then it's torn out from under you. Some people go to pieces when they stop believing in humanity. I think I was just lucky, even though I no longer believe. Stefan wasn't so lucky. Your parents don't live here? No, but I don't feel like talking about my parents today. Say, do you collect toy cars? What? No. And the car in the bag the other day? That was a DS. What? A Citroen DS. The goddess of the road. Aha. But don't tell anyone else, okay? Why? It's one of those things women would tell their best friend. Yes, because it's sweet. You're going to tell. Whom do you tell things? Whom would I tell things to? Do you have any more wine? Sure. Come along, I'll show you something. Here, this is a DS. And that's you. No, that's me. Who's that? A friend. We lived together. The car was a neighbor's. Wow. From when we were 10 or 11, our dream was to drive a car like that from Berlin to France in one go. We'd be in the Vosges mountains when the sun went up. And, did you? No. Something always came up. Some dreams are meant to stay dreams. But someday I'll do it, I swear. I already have a little DS. Okay, then. Get home safely. Thanks for dinner. I'm glad you came. Sleep tight. You, too. See you soon. Yes. Bye. Paul? Thanks. Night. You look tired. I am. Then sleep tight. You, too. Bye. Bye. Then sleep tight. You, too. Bye. Bye. Then sleep tight. You, too. Bye. Bye. I'll call you. There are moments that bum themselves into your memory, even though at the time you don't realize their significance. Frau Steiger, you know what? No, what? I'm going to summer camp. That's great! All alone? No, there are other kids there, too. If you have a kid, it could come along, too. I don't have any kids. But if I had one, it could go along. How was it today? Great. We had fun, didn't we, Lara? I reserved a time so we could get together and talk. How about Friday at 4:00 p.m.? Yes, that's perfect. Good. And where? Here in my practice. Oh, of course. Fine. Papa, Frau Steiger doesn't have any kids. Cause no one wants to be the daddy. Oh, well. That's how things go sometimes. And what do you have against him? Okay, see you Friday. Come, Lara. At 4:00 p.m. Bye, Lara. I have nothing against him. But? Nothing, "but." Besides the fact that he's a patient's father, why do I have to interpret hidden significance into everything? And Paul? Paul's nice. We go out for a movie or drink occasionally, but that's it. I'm happy with the way it is. Are you trying to get me married off, or what? No. It's okay. I don't feel like it right now. You get on my nerves with it. Okay, okay. Start with yourself. I'm working on it. You see? I'm not always asking you who it is. You could if you wanted. Give me a ring when you get home, please. Your mother was taken to the hospital today. Hi, Nele. Hi. Am I disturbing you? No, come in. What's wrong? My mother is in the hospital. Why in the hospital? She drank too much and passed out. She and my dad don't get along anymore. Since my brother and I have moved out, there's no reason for them to keep up pretenses. My father has a girlfriend, I think. And my mother's bent on destroying herself. Damn. Do you think I should drive down? I don't know. Is it terrible that I don't even know if I want to go? No, it's not terrible. You really think so? Maybe I should have been there for them more. I think parents have to deal with their problems alone, Or with friends. Kids are too involved. I'm not sure my mom has friends with whom she could talk about these things. I don't think so. It must be awful to realize suddenly that you're all alone. I can't imagine that there are people who don't have any friends. Do you have any? Real friends that you can talk about anything with? I'm going to drive down. Where is she in the hospital? In Münster. I'm scared. That's normal. Paul? Thanks for letting me be here. Paul? Yes? Can I stay here tonight? Sure. So, you're feeling tired and weak? Well… Excuse me? Yes! When did you last see a doctor? Two years ago, maybe. I never really felt sick. Pardon? I never really felt sick. That's excellent. I'm a little worried. Well… You don't have to worry. You can put your sweater back on. True, your lymph nodes are swollen, but that's no cause for concern. It just means that there's an infection somewhere… May I? …in your body. It could be a harmless infection, like the flu or something. I'm going to take some blood and we'll wait for the results. Do you have chocolate? We'll know more by later this week. Okay, men, this is our position. There's a hill about 1000 m ahead. We're going to move further west. Any questions? Good, then get ready to go. More! I don't think I have any more. More chocolate. Wait, I have to look. Wait. Stefan! Stefan! My father's a pig. Why? Because he makes my mother reveal to me what a pig she is. And you? There's nothing I can do. But my brother and I are all they have. After a whole life, they have no one. I never want to be like that. All lies. What? The lie that two people can be happy. You look tired. I guess I probably am. When more than one person is in a room, it could be the start of a friendship. But it's always the beginning of the end. That's pretty silly, isn't it? Can you prove to me that it's not true? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. No. He's right. I think you two have a huge problem. Why? It's fine the way it is. I don't want more, and neither does he. Wake up, would you? What do you mean, "wake up?" Who can't get her life together? I would say it's you. Oh, yeah? Hello. Am I early? My watch must be a little fast. No, it's fine. Let's go in here, then no one will disturb us. Coffee or tea? Water would be fine. The results don't look good. And? Herr Berger, it looks as if you probably have leukemia. The tests we've done so far are pretty definite. But I'd like to send you to a hospital for a more precise diagnosis. When? As soon as possible. We have no time to lose. Do you have anyone at home? Yes. You're exceptionally talented. You could have gotten far. I mean that. The results don't look good. But my brother and I are all they have. After a whole life, they have no one. Stefan! Hello! May I come in? Of course. Has something happened? What's the matter? I'm sick. Then get to bed. I have cancer. What? The results are pretty clear. Leukemia. And now you're asking me to leave? No. I have to go into the hospital. When? In the next few days. They have to conduct more tests. This just can't be true, can it? But it is. I'm scared. I think the two of us attract misfortune. Is that what you want? What? To attract misfortune? When I was debating whether to go see my mom, you asked me if that was what I really wanted. Of course it's not what I want. Do you want to sleep here tonight? The doctor asked me if I had anyone at home. And? I said yes. The waiting and the uncertainty were the hardest. It may sound strange, but when the doctors told me that my disease was too advanced for treatment and it would be best for me to make the most of the time I had left, it was almost a relief. Don't cry. The tears just come. I have an idea. What? I'll show you something. My favorite place. Your favorite place? Everyone should have a favorite place. Don't cry. You want me to show it to you? Now? Of course, now. From now on, now is all there is. Sit down here. What? Wait here. I don't know if this is a mistake. I had a friend once, Stefan. We went to kindergarten and school together, To the army, everywhere. Is he the one in the picture, who you wanted to go to France with? Right. Stefan convinced me to go on my first date with a girl. We were the same age, but he was like an older brother to me. We were in the army together. In 1999 we went to Kosovo as part of the KFOR troops. We weren't in combat or anything, thank God. But we saw a lot. Some people can deal with things like that better than others. It defies understanding. And some can't deal with such things at all. I always thought I was the stronger of us two. Vive la France! Stefan! Do you understand it? Stefan! I can't stand it anymore. I have to get out of here, Paul. He was alone. He had lost faith in humanity and was all alone. I think that's what I'm afraid of most. Being alone when it happens. You're not alone. I know. And besides, it's not happening yet. Stop! Hey, Hans. Give me your money and jewelry. And no funny business. Do actors earn so little? I'm not an actor today! What are you? A master thief!! Ah, a master thief. A cunning master thief. So, do you have money and jewelry? No, sorry, we don't. You're lucky. You can pass. Thank you, great master thief. Let's go away. I'd like to go on a trip with you. How? I have to work. Not for long, just a few days. And where to? To the ocean, or the mountains. Wherever you want. To the ocean? We could do that, couldn't we? For a few days? Congratulations, Herr Berger. You have won a trip for two. May I ask who you'd like to take along? Do I have to decide right away? First, I'm going to lie down for a bit. Okay, I'll make something to eat. I would never have believed how soon your strength runs out. You can feel yourself getting weaker every day. I think it was hard for Nele. But I'm glad she was with me. Not everyone would have done that. Just a few days. That would be really great. But how? Do you think you can get him out of the hospital? I have no idea, but they can't tie him down. We'll manage somehow. I'll talk to Karla. Otherwise, you just call in sick, I'm sure it's no problem. It's pretty hard, huh? I don't know. Maybe it had to be this way. Maybe I never would have met him otherwise. And your mother? I have no idea. And I don't really care right now. Hello, Frau Steiger. Hey, Lara. How are you? Good. I was at summer camp. Super. Come, tell me all about it. Could I talk to you alone for a minute? Sure. Take your shoes off in the meantime. Okay. We can go in here. I'll get right to the point. I don't know if this is the right place and I've never done this before, but… I'd like to ask if you'd go out for dinner with me sometime. That's very nice, and I don't think you picked the wrong place. Oh, good. But it's the wrong time. My boyfriend's in the hospital and he might not live much longer. I'm sorry. …I had no idea. How could you know that? Just forget what I said. Why should I forget it? It was very nice of you. Don't worry about it. I have to go see Lara now. Of course. Oh man, what an idiot I am. That's what's great about Italian food. The right pasta, the right ingredients, and presto. Hello? I'm so glad you're here. How was your day? It was okay. So was mine. I talked to Karla. I can take a few days off. That's nice. Now you can finally take that trip you won. Here. What's that? Cannelloni with zucchini, fresh tomatoes, and fennel salami. Maybe they can warm it up for you. I'm sure it's not as good as yours, but probably better than what you get here. Amazing that you remember the recipe. My mother just called. And? She's out of the hospital. My father picked her up and apologized for everything. And you know what she did when she got home? She threw out all the liquor bottles. My father didn't even complain that she didn't put them in the recycling bin. You see? Well, we'll see how long it lasts. Think positive. So tired? A little. Then try to sleep. Will you stay for a while? Sure. He's not doing well, Frau Steiger. Maybe you should notify his parents. He doesn't want that. He doesn't want to see anyone. I would so like to go for a walk with him outside. He's too weak for that. You see the shape he's in. A walk would be too much for him. How much longer will this go on? I can't say, I really can't. But, for his sake, let's hope not too much longer. Okay. Thank you. I was hoping you could help me. Was Hans too loud? Not at all. I just have a question. I need an actor and a master thief. I'm a pop star. That's good. I need someone versatile. I'm just the man you need. Oh, my God. Hey, little guy, what's the matter? What's your name? Hello, can you hear me? What happened? I have no idea, he just keeled over! Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Impossible! Did you believe me? I'm an actor, you know. Now what? The car is outside. Where did you get that? If you wish for something a lot, and do a little for it, then it comes true. Where are we going? To France. Sunrise in the Vosges mountains, remember? You're crazy. I got that from you. Look. Hey, what's the matter? What? So tired? It's okay. What's that? You have to give me directions. Hey. Here, have something to drink. Come on, you need to drink. Hey, watch the road. Paul? Hey Paul! The sun is going up. Paul? Look, the sun! Keep driving. Okay. Vive la France! Just keep driving. I liked the funeral, I must say. Even the weather played along. Not everyone's so lucky. Half a year has passed since then. A few weeks later, Nele really did have dinner with Lara's father. They're really cute together. Why am I telling you all this? I have no idea. Maybe I wish everyone had someone like Nele by their side. Even if that can be a little crazy at times.
