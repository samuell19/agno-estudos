RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM It is an exciting night tonight here at the 2018 American Sports Awards. From the basketball court to the ice rink, from the ski slopes to the gridiron. All of your favorite athletes are walking the red carpet with us tonight. And here we have champion downhill skier, Justin O'Neill, fresh off his 2nd place showing on the hit show, "Celebrity Fox Trot." - Justin. - Hi Maggie. - How are you doing? - I'm great. Justin, your first nomination for Favorite Male Athlete, since your big win in Japan. Yeah. Well, I know it's a bit of a clich√©, Maggie, but it really is an honor just to be nominated. Be honest, you wouldn't mind having that award on your bookshelf with all the other medals and trophies. Winning isn't everything, Maggie. Except on the mountain. - Good luck tonight, Justin. - Thank you, Maggie. Anna. Give me some good news. I wish I could, Justin. Niels is out. Can't believe Neils quit. We'll find you a new coach. I don't want a new coach, I want my old coach. Did you tell him I'm done with physical therapy? I'm cleared to start training again? He doesn't think that he can get you back into shape in time for the Winter Classic, but do not be discouraged. I can't start racing without a coach. I've been out a year. I have irons in the fire. Irons in the fire. But why aren't you packed? We're leaving in the morning. You know, maybe I should wait. Find a new coach, train for a few months and then I'll be ready. You grew up on Winter Mountain, Justin. It's the perfect place for your comeback. People back home... they expect a lot from me. And you'll deliver when you take first in the Classic. Plus, all those endorsement deals are gonna come rushing back. Trust me, this is not my first rodeo. Now, eat, finish packing, while I go work the phones. Create some buzz. I'm picking you up at 9:00. Back to Winter Mountain. And it's gonna be great. The hometown hero has arrived. I can see the headline already. You ready to take your first run? Yeah. Yeah. But I need to go say hi to my parents first. - See you in a bit. - Alright. ...were a great idea. We can get one more display over by the fireplace. So is this where you go to lodge a complaint about the lodge? Well, look who's finally home. Hi Mom. Dad. Good to see you, Justin. How's the knee? - Fully recovered. - Range of motion? - 100%. - You run a black diamond yet? - Today. - You look good. We haven't seen you since Austria. We don't talk about Austria, Mom. In my mind, Austria doesn't even exist anymore. I've completely blocked it out. Hey. Everyone takes a spill. You should've seen your father after the Swiss Downhill in '84 I know. I know. And I still took first in that championship. You just get back on the horse, like I did, all will be well. - That's my plan. - Good. How about some cocoa? Your dad bought this fancy new machine - for the lobby's happy hour. - Absolutely. Extra marshmallows. Plying me with my favorite things? I'll bake you a key lime pie, too, if it'll get you home more often. It could work. There you are. I got you a 2:00 p.m. radio interview. Great. You remember Anna, my manager? - Of course. Sit down. - Hi. - I'll get you some cocoa. - Thanks, but I'm off sugar. So what's the status of the new coach? That's the important thing here, huh? A coach before interviews. I can make a few calls... Now, we have a few irons in the fire, right? - That's right, lots of irons. - So who are you thinking of? How's the auction coming along, Mom? She runs a fundraiser during the Carnival. I'm looking forward to it. In fact, Kayla has helped us get some great auction items. Have you... seen her yet? No. Not yet. You should drop by the ski school and say hi. I will. At some point. Old... family friend. Kayla Green. Best ski instructor we've got if you're interested in some lessons while you're here. - Martin Green's daughter. - Yeah. Yeah. He was my coach. Justin mentioned that. You've got quite the legacy here. Skiing is in our blood. Speaking of, I am gonna go get that run in, before the interview. Look out! Little rug-rat. Hey, I'm so sorry about them. Are you okay? Justin. Hi, Kay. Why do you look like you've just seen a ghost? Well, I wasn't expecting to see you yet. The Winter Classic isn't for another week. Are you a ghost? Not that I know of. Why do you ask? Well, you just kind of disappeared like Poof! - You know? - Right. Yep. All me. Flesh and blood. So where is... where's Niels? I'm not training with Niels right now. So, how you been Kay? I mean, evidently not as good as you. You know, magazine covers, profiles, the Arctic Skin Thermals commercial last year. That was something. But can you tell me the... yeah, the arm flex? Was that your idea or...? That wasn't mine... completely. Lot of comments on social media about it. Are you cyber-stalking me? I'm flattered. I just hope it's still about the skiing for you and not the notoriety. It's always about the skiing, Kay. Well, you better get back to skiing, because you just got smoked by a bunch of 12 year-olds. - Bye. - Yeah. See ya. That went well. Okay, on Thursday we're gonna hit an intermediate, so I want you to get lots of sleep, okay? Okay. Good job today. What took you so long? You didn't fall again, did you? No. I just ran into an old friend. So that's the infamous Kayla Green. I mean, I don't know about infamous. I mean, legendary, maybe, but I don't wanna overshoot it. Kayla, this is my manager, Anna. Hey. Nice to meet you. You've done a good job with him. Thank you. I mean, not many skiers become a household name. - It's true. - Yeah. Sure they do. And now, you're on track to be the youngest winner ever. Not ever. Because of that guy. Yeah. He still holds the record. Winning the Classic at only 19 years-old. I'm already 20. Here. One sec, eh? Justin O'Neill. Dude, I'm not worthy. I... I'm sorry, Hunter Davies. Big fan. I've... I've seen you ski. Looks like you're gonna give us all a run for our money up there. I just can't believe I'm gonna be racing against you. I used to have this guy's poster on my wall as a kid! You were the best there is. I remember, when I first saw you on TV, Years, and years, and god, years ago... and my dad let me stay up until 2:00 a.m. just to watch you ski, live, in Japan. That was... that was a great race. It was good meeting you. I guess, I'll see you up on the hill. Yeah. Cool. Hey, I'd buy you a beer, But I'm not old enough. So anyways, catch you later, man. Catch you later. I'll get to you this week, too, Justin. Big comeback? We're all excited to see how it goes. Absolutely. Any time. You've got Anna's number. You know that that's just noise, right? Remember what my dad used to say about the press, "Let them say what they're gonna say... and keep on skiing." I forgot all about that. Here is your schedule for tomorrow. You've got the Ainsley twins again. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm gonna buy you lunch. - You are a slippery one. - I'm slippery? When were you gonna tell me about your little run-in with Justin O'Neill? How do you know about that? I can see it all over your face. Gossip travels at the speed of light around here. - Yeah. - And it wasn't a run-in, it was an encounter and it was fine. Oh no, okay, hold on. Why are you not furious with him? I'm still mad at Jason Gregory for ditching me at the 5th grade dance and what Justin did was way worse. He didn't do anything. Except for maybe radio silence - for the past few years. - Oh, come on. You were going out on the circuit together, like Dad and Tom. He had the chance to be coached by Niels Rediger. I wasn't about to hold him back from that. And I what... I didn't have a professional track record. Dad taught us everything we know. That's your track record. And he loved watching you coach Justin, seeing you follow in his footsteps. Yeah, and if he were here with me right now, he would love watching me run the school with you and carrying on his and Mom's legacy. In that way I'm happy. Justin's happy. We're... we're just happy people. Four years since I had Nora's pot roast and it's exactly the same. That's why you get it. You know, I do follow a strict training diet. Most of the time. I didn't say a word. Justin O'Neill, can I get a selfie? Yeah. It'll cost you. - Good to see you, man... - You too. Not on my TV. We miss you out here, J. Well, you've got me for the next week. Hey, how is your knee doing? Did they do deep tissue regeneration? Ultrasound? Yeah. All of the above, Dr. Murphy. Not Dr. Murphy just yet. Not for another five months. Not a moment too soon. Working for these two, by day, and studying hard at night. Hey, got time for a drink? Go ahead. - We'll see you later. - Not too late, okay? I'm gonna close off the back run until 7:00 a.m., so you can have it for yourself. - I'll be there at 6. - Okay. Good. - Alright. Good night, guys. - Good night. About that beer... I'm in training, let's make it a coffee. Yeah. I've always wanted to be Irish. - Come on, big guy. - Yeah. So what's going on, man? You haven't been home in like five years? Four. It's a busy life, traveling around all the time, from race to race... Come on, J. It's me, man. You haven't raced in a year. Why didn't you come home to the PT Institute to rehab? Best sports medicine clinic in the world is on the Upper East Side. My surgeon is right around the corner. You don't pass that kind of thing up. That's how was back in racing shape in record time. I'm gonna be way better than those guys, okay? And I'm gonna give you a stack of business cards for your racing buddies for when they wipe out. Great ambulance chaser of Winter Mountain to the rescue! Don't you cheapen me like that... come on. - That's what's he's at. - Two or three. Are you still carrying a torch for Kayla's sister? You ever gonna do anything about it? - When the time is right. - When the time is right. Yeah. You still carrying a torch for her? Oh, come on, what are you talking about? We were best friends. It was never like that between Kay and I. Sure, Bud. Yep. Right. He's favoring the left knee. Is he still having pain in the right? - Not for a few months. - No, he's playing it safe. His knee is healed, it's time to use it. That knee is healed, it's time to use it. You're not finishing your turns. Your weight is too far back. This is so not my place. I cannot turn this off. I'm gonna leave you to it. No. Don't turn it off. Because I think we just found Justin's new coach. - Excuse me?! - Kayla? For the week. To see how it goes. No I'm like so swamped this week. I've got like the ski school... And she's not even a coach, coach. 'Scuse me, I did coach you to your first - Winter Classic victory. FYI. - Yes! Think of the optics, Justin. Plus, her father led your father to victory after victory. And history has a tendency to repeat itself. Is that always such a good thing, Anna? And... what happened to the irons in the fire? The fire's out. Squelched. Justin needs someone who tells it like it is, no sugar coating. No playing to his ego. All of that can be a big distraction for him. Justin, I can hear you, you know. Let me finish. Who better than his best friend from childhood? Someone who knew him when. Who isn't gonna be distracted by the glitz and glamour - that comes with Justin O'Neill. - Again... hearing everything. It all comes from a place of love. You know, I... I just this there has to be other option. Like what about his dad? No-no-no! Not an option. Or my sister, Jenny. She works at the ski school with me and she's amazing. Has Jenny ever coached downhill? I think that you're making my case for me. He needs this. He needs you. Do it for old time's sake. Over here. Is he gonna listen to me? - Are you gonna listen to her? - I don't know. I don't know even know her coaching technique anymore. Okay, goodbye. - Bye bye. - Justin! Come on. Fine. I'll do whatever you say. Within reason. I don't teach anything that's without reason. It's settled then. We start tomorrow. You guys are amazing. Okay, good job. But remember, if you feel the slightest little skid, I want you to keep your hips up, But whatever you do, you don't get stuck in the "zombie position," okay? I've got my eyes on you. Alright. Get back up. - Good morning. - Hey. I thought we were training at 9:00. We are. So you gonna have someone take over your class for you? No. So what are we doing here? You're gonna up that magic carpet with my kids. The bunny hill. You gotta learn to crawl before you can walk. Is this within reason? Because I don't see how skiing with a bunch of kids on a bunny hill is gonna help me win the Classic. Well, maybe you could give me the benefit of the doubt. It's just a thought. When I was your age, my favorite thing was skiing on fresh, fallen powder. There's no feeling like it. You remember that, Justin? - This is hardly powder. - Work with me. Dude! So cool! Yeah. Just a little lesson here. Gotta give back to the kids, you know? Stay humble. Namaste. Alright, nobody tells the truth, and there is ice-cream in it for you. Alright, I want you to show me those pizza slices and snow plow... 3, 2, 1! GO! Plow! Okay. Bend your knees. Keep your weight forward. Beautiful! You're doing so great. Come on, those pizza slices. I believe in you! - You alright? - Yeah. - Can't ski well. - That's okay. She's new on the scene, but as good as her father. Maybe better. Of course he's wearing the Mountain Ridge Boots. He doesn't care if the commercials aren't running anymore, they are always on his feet. Yeah, it'll be televised. The 29th. Okay, thanks Ruth. We are this close to getting Mountain Ridge Boots back on board. How was your time today? - We didn't run the course. - Why not? Because my "coach" wouldn't let me off the bunny hill. Are you serious? We have 7 days. Yeah. This was your brilliant idea, Anna. I am sure she has a plan. Okay. Okay. Please tell me you took photographs. No, I didn't want to humiliate the man. But it was really funny seeing him standing there - with a bunch of little kids. - What are you doing? Are you trying to mess with his head? What? I wouldn't do that. I just want him to stop trying to be Justin O'Neill, the superstar, and just be... just be Justin O'Neill, the skier. Well, if anyone can bring him back, it's you. I don't know. He's a bit more challenging than he used to be. What's going on? What... Why are you dressed like that? There's a locker room, inside. You can get changed in there. What are we doing? It's day two and I have yet to be on the training course. You know, once upon a time you used to trust me. - You could try that now. - Do you have a plan here? What do you think? I think answering questions with questions is a standard deflection technique. Yeah. It certainly can be. I wanna know the plan. We're partners, here. The plan is... you need to comeback down to earth and get centered again. You are very cryptic. - I don't like that. - Oh, well, just know this... there is a method to my madness. I'm... Still... no idea what your plan is. I understand none of this. And it's really hot in here. It's Bikram. It's sweaty yoga. Yeah. That seems pretty unsanitary. No, it's great. You get a deeper stretch, it improves your circulation. - Plus, your skin glows. - And that helps me how? Switch legs. Put all your weight on the bad knee. Can we just ask her to open a window? Just a tiny sliver. Fine. Put your weight on the bad knee. Let's keep it down, please. Keep our zen intact for our neighbors. Balance. Right. Hey. Don't help me. I will conquer this, alright? I will conquer this. I will... conquer this. I did not conquer that. I don't think my body bends that way. Sweaty yoga is unnecessary torture. Well, you get used to it after, you know, a while. - Am I going to need to? - We'll see. Look at that, they've still got all my favorite midway games. You know, that's the last time I was here. - The Classic. Four years ago. - Yep. Still couldn't win that ring toss. - You know, I think it's fixed. - That's not fixed. - Oh please. - I speak from experience. And maybe I'll win you something nice this week. Nope, this time around, I will succeed at the ring toss. It's my time. I am due. If only the Classic was every year, you'd have more of a chance. But, I mean, if this is what it takes to get you home. I can't change the racing schedule. The season is five months of the year. Yeah, but appearances and endorsements during the seven other months, pay for those five. Plus, training. You know, I've got to follow the snow. Your parents missed you. It's not like I haven't seen them. They were at every race. Yeah. I know. Jenny and I run the lodge when they're gone. My mom said that the ski school is thriving. You've developed quite the reputation. I'm just doing everything my Dad would've done. Not everything. When I left I never thought you would've quit coaching. Oh, 'cause I didn't. I coach the ski team. Yeah, but you wanted to be a racing coach. - It's a racing team. - Of 12 year-olds. That's where champions are born. No one knows that more than you. You could've been so great. That did not come out right. No. I would imagine not. - You loved coaching. - I'm actually still coaching! I'm coaching you right now. Would you like me to wear a name tag so you don't forget. That's not what I meant, okay? You know, I feel like I can ever say anything right - with you, Kay. - Justin... we had a plan and it didn't work out. It happens. - You still seem pretty angry. - I'm not upset about it. I was the one that told you to go train with Niels. Did you want me to not go? Justin, it's not that you left, you left, and you barely looked back. You went away and took our friendship with you. And the fact that you don't even realize that is... ...you know, ground zero. Like... bunny hill, - I means, he's gotta start... - Justin on the bunny bill? - Yes. - Are there pictures? - No. Get outta here. - And then what...? Hey, you two. You know what, Justin. This lady knows a thing or two. I know. And you'd be wise to listen to her. Well, I always listen to my coach. That's so debatable. This was a good call... you two working together again. The O'Neills and the Greens have always been a recipe for success. I like it. - Justin? - Sorry. That almost sounded like positive feedback, I don't know what to make of it. Yeah. Because he's really proud of you. He's really proud... - Oh, you're serious. - Yes. Everything I do is wrong. Nothing I do is the way he'd do it. That's not why you're here. No. I came to get see your father. About me? No, contrary to what you may believe, not everything is always about you. It isn't? Well... - this is disappointing news. - Alright, come on. - Let's get back out there. - Right now? But it's opening ceremonies in the village tonight. Yeah. I know. Jenny and I are going. This is not gonna take too long. You know, I'm going with Wyatt. Maybe we can meet you there. - Yeah. If you want. - I do. - Okay. - I... I really am sorry... for everything. Justin, you can win this race. But it's not your knee that's the problem. Your head is. We can fix that. I know what you're doing. We used to come out here at night and plan our path for world domination on the race circuit. You're about to see, I'm not so cryptic, after all. You cracked my code. So what is it that you want now, Justin O'Neill? - I wanna win. - Why? Because it beats losing? And? I feel like that's a good enough reason. But what is it, really? I mean, you've got countless medals. A world record that no one has been able to top. Why do you wanna win now? Because racing is all I have. It's not all you have. It's all you chose. - So what about you? - What? You don't get off that easy. We come out here to plot world domination for the both of us. So... what do you want, Kayla Green? Nothing. I'm perfectly content. You were never complacent. You always had goals. Dreams. Guys falling at your feet. Well, I mean, I do teach people to glide on ice, So I guess falling is inevitable. What about dating? You know, like, a few guys here and there, but nothing really took. Not since Vince. Vince? Your parents didn't tell you about him? We don't... talk about... stuff. He was an instructor here... two years ago. We almost got married. But your dad talked me out of it. Well, he does love telling people what to do, doesn't he? He wasn't telling me what to do, he was protecting me. My dad? Tom O'Neill? Yeah. Do you have another dad that I'm not aware of? You are lucky to have him. And your mom, too. It's really hard losing both parents and... yours have both filled that void for both, me and Jenny. I know. I know, it's... complicated between me and my dad. I guess, all my relationships are pretty complicated, aren't they? We should go. Opening ceremony is at 8 o'clock and you need a shower. Race you back? Hardly sounds fair, I mean, I am a professional. Race you? Last one to the lodge, buys the first round tonight! Justin! Justin! - Hey Anna! - I've been calling you! My phone is on silent. I'm heading to the carnival kick off, you want to come? Raincheck on that. The president of Snow Voltz Ski Wear is in the bar and he wants to meet you. You need to get in there! I'm supposed to meet some friends. Text them. You'll be 20 minutes late, tops. Get in here. Now! Okay. Okay-okay. I'm coming. So I took my inheritance, retired from snowboarding and started Snow Voltz Ski Wear. Five years in, we're now one of the top brands. It's very inspiring what you've accomplished at your age. And we know there's a lots of competition out there, but there is no one better to endorse Snow Voltz Ski Wear than Justin. He's a world champion and his products sell. I like you, Justin. I wanted to bring you into the fold year one, but you were tied up with Mountain Ridge Boots at the time. I think you're relatable, you could bring a nice "maturity" to our brand. Expand our reach. Maturity. Right. But that was a pretty big spill you took in Austria, to be honest, I have yet to see a skier come back from an injury like that. I have to wonder if maybe our time has passed. I get the hesitation, okay? You wanna make sure that the old Justin is back before you commit. But if I didn't think that I could pull out a win, I wouldn't put myself on this international stage. You'll see after the race, your worries about me are completely unfounded. Alright. Let's wait and see what happens on Sunday. Alright. I'm serious. - Hey, you made it. - Hi. Hi. How are you? We had to get away from organizing auctions items, my head was starting to spin. You know this family. When we set our minds to something... - My son giving you any trouble? - Of course he is. But I know how to handle him. Hey, have you seen him? He texted that he'd be here half an hour ago. Well, yeah, you know Justin. Phone calls and interviews. I'm sure they're on their way. Hi! Hi! Welcome! Welcome to the Winter Classic. A weeklong celebration of food, and drink, and games, and an auction, and some good old-fashioned line dancing, you know? That's right. It's happening right here in the village, leading up to the big race on Sunday. That's right! And all the game proceeds go to Skiing for Scholarships, so like from the auction. We have so many great items this year. We have diamond earrings. Spa services. And staycations. So get your checkbooks ready, okay? Alright. We'll be back in a second. How about some cocoa? Your treat. - Okay. I'd love some. - Get me one too, please. I know, I know... I made it as quickly... Oh finally. Someone sounds anxious to see Justin. I'm not anxious. I just don't like waiting on people. You say you're gonna be there at a certain time, - then you arrive at that time. - Alright, okay. Go ahead, lady, if you wanna "doth protest too much." I am so sorry, my manager set up a meeting - and I just couldn't say no. - It's okay. They're about to announce the start list. Hang on, don't let him off the hook that easy. I gave this guy the silent treatment the whole way here. Hi. Jenny. And how are you? I'm good, Wyatt. How are you? I'm... yeah. That was so smooth. And now, to introduce the Winter Classic racers is someone who needs no introduction at all. Is the current World Slalom Champion, Nancy Sieber. Wait... is she racing? I don't see her on the start list. Yeah. She's here, training for the Zurich Invitational, with Hunter Davies' coach. Thank you so much for that warm welcome, considering I'm not even racing this week. But the line-up is top notch, and it sure to be quite a race; with racers like Hunter Davies. Lars Edmund. Anthony Norman. And Winter Mountain's very own, Justin O'Neill. Thank you so much, guys. We'll see you on Sunday! Alright. So... - shall we get a drink? - You two go. You gotta get home and get some rest. What? You should've been here earlier. - Fine, coach. - Good. Because tomorrow we're running the course. What? No! Yes? Yes! Finally, we train. What was that? Because that was definitely not the Justin O'Neill who took first place in Zermatt. Tough love angle, huh? Alright. So maybe I'm a little rusty. And those pillows at the lodge... I really gotta talk to my dad about that. - Those things are so lumpy. - Pillows?! - They are awful. - Okay, excuses and 30 bucks is gonna get you a ticket to the race you are not in. I know. I know. I don't know what's wrong with me. - I'm all over the place. - Okay. Alright. Let's just take a break. Do you remember when we were on the junior team? Some of the best times of my life. We had the whole world ahead of us. I mean, the whole world is still ahead of you. You just have to get back in that headspace when nothing mattered but the wind in your face. The sound of snow under my skies. The rush of it all. Yeah. You know, my knee... healed, what if I never get back to what I used to be? My dad used to say, "Never let success get to your head and failure get to your heart." So once your head is back in the game, then your knee is gonna follow. Thanks, Coach. - Let's go again. - Alright. How is he looking? Well, he's not favoring his good knee anymore, and his turns are solid. How's the time? It's improved since this morning, but it still not close to course record. What else does he need? He needs positive reinforcement. Not criticism, 'cause I think his confidence is a little low. Confidence has never been his problem. Yeah. I know. That's how you know it's serious. Looking... looking good out there, Justin. Thanks. So, your mom's auction is this evening, I think she was hoping that you would drop by? - I was planning on it. - Okay. Okay, then. So you're looking good. - Can I show you something? - Yeah. Justin, you look very handsome. I'm not gonna dress like a slouch on your big night. It's really nice to have you home. It's nice to be home. Now, eat. Drink. Be merry. And bid on some auction items, would you? - Deal. - Okay. Cheapskate. Excuse me, but I think I'm being pretty generous. Whatever, man. Next time we host this thing I'm gonna be a doctor and make millions for this place. - I can't wait. - Alright. - Ski lessons? - Yeah-yeah-yeah. We got diamond earrings? Fancy. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. - Jenny... you look... You look really great, too, Wyatt. Thanks. Dinner with Hunter Davies is at $500? Why didn't my mother ask me to donate anything this year? Maybe your mom didn't know that'd be in town this long? I mean, Hunter offered. I still don't understand why she didn't ask. I mean, I've always donated something. Well, maybe... you could've offered, too? Well, I'm offering now. Let's find something of mine we can put out on the table. Okay. Okay. I will take care of it. You go sit down. Live auction is about to start. And sold! To paddle 107 for $600. Thank you very much, Sir. Okay. Okay. I've just been told that there had been a last minute donation to the live auction as well as a special guest auctioneer, the head of our ski school, here at Winter Mountain, Miss Kayla Green. Hi how are you? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I helped secure some of the items that we will be auctioning off this evening, which benefits Skiing for Scholarships, in its 20th year of sending underprivileged kids to college, courtesy of that beautify angel over there, Gretchen O'Neill. Great work! Who wants to know about this exciting new item up for bid, huh? One of you lucky folks is gonna get to spend the entire day with World Cup Champion, multiple medalist, hawker of everyone's favorite hiking boots... Justin O'Neill! Come on up here, Justin! Let's send some kids to college together. Come on! A day with this legend, right here. Let's start the bidding, shall we? - $150. - $200! - Do I hear $200! - $200! $200! $200 over here! Do I hear $300? We've got $300? She's $300 right there! $500! Look who just upped the ante. Justin, look at that! Do you wanna know something? I think we can do a little bit better than that, don't you? This is the spokesman of the Arctic Skin Thermals, okay? You all remember that silly commercial? I bet you got paid a lot of money? But listen, show us the flex? Come on, they wanna see it? They wanna see the flex! Do I hear $1000? Look at this guy! Come on, he's a legend! 2018's Athlete of the Year! Come on! He beat them all! He's a champion! Three thousand dollars! Okay? Do I hear... $3500? $3500! Ma'am, you just outbid yourself. It's for the kids. $3500, going once. Going twice. Sold. To that beautiful lady holing paddle number 41 for $3500. I think that's a record for a single item at an auction, at this auction, right Gretchen? That's correct. Thank you, Justin. No... thank you all for your generosity. - I like this. - What? My old friend is back. Remember when we used to sneak out as kids - and come up here? - Watch the night skiers? Yeah. Throw snowballs at them. - Run and hide? Yes. - Memories. I'm glad that we're making new ones. I thought I had it all figured out. Go pro and take on the world. Justin, that's exactly what you did. So... You... okay? You're living the good life, man. Premieres, parties, beautiful actresses. I mean, not that I'm into that kind of thing... - I am really not. - Okay. You know, none of that stuff is real. You're always wondering if people like you for who you are or what you can do for them. Well, you know, our dad always said, "You gotta focus on the people who loved you when you were invisible to everyone else." No one knows you like those you came up with. Yeah, you know, being back with you, guys, the auction, the night skiers out there... this is real. Hey, you got to where you wanted to go, man. Not everyone can say that. I mean, I wanted to be a Backstreet Boy, when I was younger. Look at me now. Consider yourself lucky, pal. I know. I don't mean to sound ungrateful. You're so good at it. Justin, what are you doing here this morning? Just thinking. This room seemed ginormous when I was a kid. Well, you were much shorter then. Good point. Hey Mom, what was it like being married to Dad, when he was on the circuit. Exciting. And challenging. But we made it work. What about when he retired? - Were you disappointed? - Not at all. We finally got the chance to build something, together. Or besides you that is. Honey, if I've learned anything from living with your father, is, that sometimes it's best to step back from all the noise, and think about what it is that would make you truly happy. The simple question. Right now, you're just a guy, sitting in a room, tying to figure it all out. What does that guy see when he looks to his future? And keep it vague. Don't give specific times or techniques. Just be very positive and upbeat. - Okay. - Smiling. Smiling the whole time. This is a big deal. Justin is a comeback story. And everybody loves a great comeback. He knows the drill, but are you doing okay? - Kayla? - Yes. I left my body for a minute. I'm good. You can do this. Forget about the cameras. You're just having a conversation with your very good friend and this nice lady. Right. Got it. Okay. Justin, let's get you here on the right, and Kayla here on the left. Alright. - Alright. - Careful there. You okay? Yeah. Great. - Hi, how are you? - Hi. If you get nervous, just look in my eyes. Connect with me, okay? - I got you. - Okay. In fact, The Winter Classic was the first race you ever won? And then, you went on to win it again, two other years. So what's different about this year? Well, I wasn't recovering from an knee injury, so there's that. But, no, I'm coming along. I'm healing... in every sense of the word. And I owe a lot of that to this exceptional woman right here. She's not only my coach, but a really good friend. I'm looking at this Winter Classic as a way to get back so many things that I've lost. Like that medal he should've won in Austria. He was on track for it, like he is for this race. So Kayla, after Justin joined the professional circuit, you didn't coach again. Not a professional racer, Maggie, no. I mean, how do you top, working with this guy? Even if was a long time ago. But I am happy to say that our Winter Mountain Lodge junior racers, have taken the state alpine championship, - three years running. - Wonderful. Well, I think I speak for everyone when I say, we are four days away and we can't wait to see how you two do, together, on that mountain, again. Take a run with me. No, I need to watch from down here. Come on, one run. Please. Come on, warm me up like old times. Pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty please. I'll go get my stuff. That was very graceful. And there wasn't even a team of 12 year-olds to take me out like some people I know. Careful, it's... slippery. - Hi. - Hi. You look kinda lonely down here. - You okay? - Yeah. How is your knee? Feels good. - This feels good. - Does it? I think I have snow up my back a little bit. I meant this... us. You know, back together, again. Yes, it's nice. It's nice. You know, I think you're sufficiently warmed up and I think we gotta get back to work. Right. You okay? Yeah. That happens from time to time. Remember, it's not my knee, it's my head. Yeah, believe it not your head is actually improving, I'm a little bit nervous about this knee. It's fine. Look, I have so much metal in there. I'm practically bionic. If it's sore we should treat it. And not exacerbate any inflammation. I'm fine. What did I tell you about fighting with me? I don't really remember anything in particular about fighting, but there was listening, obeying... tree pose. The correct answer is; Kayla, I will do whatever you say. And I will not ever argue with you... and you're perfect. - That is a mouthful. - Just try it. I will do whatever you say, Kayla, I will not argue with you... You're per... perfect. Justin, where is this all coming from? Let's go ice your knee. What are you waiting for? You need me to carry you? Nope. I'm good. Just tightening my boot buckles. Be right down. So I mean, if you're not doing anything, there is, there is a party for my graduating class. - You should come. - Yeah, no, I mean, I... I'd love to. Just, you know, send me the details. Okay. - You can like rest on me... - I'm alright. I'm alright. Because I can like handle it. I'm like pretty strong. What? What did you do to yourself? It's nothing. I'm just a little sore. I mean, that's not uncommon for that type of injury, but what are you doing to maintain your physical therapy, while you're training. Not much, haven't really needed it. Well, today's your lucky day, J, we're gonna start on a full PT regimen. So the deep heat will help circulation in the ligament and help with pain and inflammation. We're gonna have to do this at least once a day before the race, and ice it at least twice. It's very impressive, Wyatt. Thanks. You should probably call it a day on the training for now. - Start fresh tomorrow. - A night off. Well, I guess a can get a little rest. Not do fast mister. There are some not-fixed carnival games with our names written all over them. Alright, the knee may be questionable, but my ring toss arm is sharp. Plus there's line dancing in the square. Normally on Tuesday we go do that at the saloon but... I love line dancing. You hate line dancing. Okay. You haven't been here in a long time. No, no, he's really good at it. You're gonna love it, trust me. Everyone goes, we wear cute boots... Great, then it's a date. I mean, not a date. Date. Unless, unless you want it to be a date. Is it a date? - Should it be a date? - It's a date. Just... It's a date. Hey son... Are you okay? Just a little sore. Totally normal for an injury like mine. Justin, sit down for a minute. I had an ultrasound treatment today, and I'll have another tomorrow. What did Kayla say about your turns? She mentioned they were inconsistent. Dad, you don't need to micro manage me. - I know what I'm doing. - I never said you didn't. Then why don't we ever talk about something else? Like Fantasy Football, or the weather. Yeah. You know, this is what my father did to me. He rode me so hard and I hated it. But I was a winner... You were the best. Justin, you're better than I ever was. It's not even close. Really? I knew you were a champion from the get-go. Because you're a true natural. You know, I don't know if I can get back there. I'm healed but it just doesn't feel the same. So you have to work ten times harder. And I'm saying this not out of judgment, just... it's from experience. What if I don't win the Classic? What if... What if I'm done? I just, I just wanna make you proud. Of course I'm proud of you. Yes! Yes-yes-yes! Go! - Alright! - Yeah! - Oh come on! - Yes! That's alright. I wasn't even trying anyway. I want you to keep this. So that you remember that the game is not fixed and that just I beat you. That's so sweet. I will cherish this forever. Can't believe he finally did it after all these years. Maybe the bear won her heart. Well, then this wins a toe. A big toe. I'll have a beer and... What? I can have one beer. I will have his beer, you can get him a club soda. What's that? The fish says you're bossy. Well, you tell the fish, that's what you pay me for. - Thank you. - Thank you. She is dedicated. Yeah. Well, she's the only one who stuck by me after the injury. They called it a "career ender," but she never doubted my comeback. Well, it's nice to have someone like that in your corner. You know, you were always in my corner. I'm sorry I walked out of yours. How is your confidence tonight? On a scale of panic to arrogance, I'd give myself, a mildly assured. But, you know, there is no pain right now so that's good. I'm not talking about your knee. I'm talking about your dance moves? Wyatt said I should, you know, probably rest my knee, - so I'd better pass. - Please, line dancing is like walking with music. You're cleared for the dance floor, partner. Oh, great. Great. This isn't so hard. Wait you guys do this too?! Every week. Kayla and Jenny introduced us. It's great exercise. What is going on? My parents are line dancing. Yeah. You should hang out with us more often. We're fun. No-no-no. Kick. You be good to her. Yes, Sir. I told you he was a good man. And so is his son. The old Justin is back. Yeah, feels good to be back. You know, I spent my life trying to be this great champion, like my dad. Well, you succeeded. But I was chasing more than just the win. I wasn't sure what it was, but something was missing. Did you figure it out? I think I did tonight. You know, I wanted an gold medal, and I got it. I wanted to be a world champion. Done. There was one thing I think I always wanted that I could never have. What is that? You. Justin O'Neill... you never asked. Yeah. Get some sleep. Because we're changing your training to the Winter Classic run tomorrow. Goodnight, Sir. Goodnight, Kayla. So we did all that crazy line dancing, and then I walked her home. And? A gentleman does not kiss and tell. Well, it did take you 15 years, so I guess good things come to those who wait, right? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. So, how about you and Kayla? You seemed a bit friendly last night. You know me and Kay. We've always been close. Any pain? A little. But I've got three days. We'll keep working on it. Yeah. Maybe I should quit while I'm a head. Join you on the road. I can be your team doctor. I can be your... your entourage. Your personal umbrella carrier. Yeah... I mean, if everything goes well, I should be back out on the circuit in a few weeks. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Just me and you on the road, huh?! - Yeah. - Hey. No. Dude, me and Jenny, we're finally dating. I can't leave home now. You're on your own, buddy. You're on your own. You seem to be getting over that. I am. He's sweet. You know, it's about time you came around, too. It's been what? Two years since Vince. Well, I date. It's just hard meeting people in a town when everyone is always coming and going, once the snow melts. I mean, I can think of one person who might interest you. Really good-looking, ski champ who just happens to be in town for the Winter Classic this Sunday. Oh yes. Hunter Davies... oh god, no, he's too young for me. Kay, you've been in love with Justin O'Neill since we were kids, don't try and deny it. - You guys always had a thing. - I am his coach, Jenny. There has to be... you know, boundaries. But you like coaching at this level again. Yes, I love it. Okay. So go on the road with him. Like the two of you planned to, before. This is your chance at giving your dream a real shot, Kay. Do not let it slip away again. That was better. - How much better? - Well, let's just focus on strength and relaxation for the next few runs. Because I can see you're... you're tense. - It's in your jaw. - Yeah. Your form looked good up there. - Oh, Nancy. Big fan. - Ditto. You know, I had an ACL tear a couple years ago. Looks like you're doing everything right. Both of you. Well, thank you for saying that. - Good luck on Sunday. - Thank you. Alright. Let's do it. Relaxed, focused, like when you skied Cortina. Let's go. Alright. Alright. Alright. Relax. Relax. Are you okay?! Justin! Justin! Ju... What was my time? 1:11:44. Two tenths off the course record! Yes! What about your knee? Knee is good, head is good. I'm gonna take one more run. Then, I'm taking you to dinner. Let's go! I am so sorry, I'm late. Our favorite instructor he almost quit today, because we have these twins, these Ainsleys, and they come up every season and they're a little bit unruly? So we had to try - and talk him out of it. - It's okay. It's okay. It's not the first time I've been left waiting on a date. This is a date? - What did you think it was? - Like a dinner. It is a dinner date. Didn't we already try that once? We were 18. And you had a crush on Matt Fitzsimmons and talked about him the whole time. I dodged a bullet with that one - because he is now in jail. - What? No? I'm just kidding. He runs the pharmacy. But he knows all our secrets so we have to stay in his good graces. Yeah. Everyone... knows everything - about everyone around here. - Yeah, it's part of our charm. I know. - Table is ready. - Okay. Kris Davenport come to town... Like the Kris Davenport? Yeah, and he wanted to impress his new girlfriend so he signed up for a lesson at the Lodge. I mean, this guy is like James Bond, he hangs out of helicopters in his movies, but you put him in a pair of skis, he can't even stand upright. That's incredible. Sorry. Can I get your autograph? Yeah. Yeah. - Hold that thought? - That... this is important. - Thanks. What's your name, bud? - Brady Brady. - Hey, are you a big fan? - Yeah. Yeah? Me, too. Between you and me, I think he's going to win that race on Sunday, so I would save that autograph. It's nice to meet you. Thanks. You know what? I'll catch you all on my way out, okay? Promise. Thank you. Sorry. So you were saying, Kris Davenport... So he hired one of our ski instructors to wear his ski clothes, and go down the run while his new girlfriend watched from the balcony up above. - He hired a stunt double? - Hired a stunt double. This is not for a movie. This was in real life. Celebrities can be crazy. I mean, not like... not all of them. Do you wanna address the elephant in the room now? I don't think they allow elephants - in this establishment. - You kissed me. - You kissed ME. - You liked it. - I didn't actually say that. - You didn't like it? I didn't say that either. So what does this mean? I don't know, you tell me. You're the one that's leaving after the Classic. What if I didn't? You're thinking of retiring? I don't know. Competing never felt like a job, but the thought of leaving and going out on the circuit again just... doesn't really excite me anymore. I don't know. Suddenly, I can see my future and it looks a lot different. How? I feel like it's here. With my family at the lodge... with you. What do you think about that? You really think he's serious about staying? I don't know. Maybe. Or maybe he's looking for a contingency plan, in case he doesn't win and he's forced into early retirement. Okay. It's only one race. He's still got some years left in him, if he wants it. Did you mention going with him? There really wasn't any point. Okay. So... coaching? Just because he's done doesn't mean you have to be. No, the time for me to have really gone for this was 14 years ago, right after Justin left. You're not gonna know until you try. Kay, this was your dream! Maybe dreams can change. I don't know. There he is. Are you ready for Sunday? I will be. I have one more day of training. Good. I'm not nervous. Is that weird? The absence of nerves, it was always welcome for me. But I mean, they're come back when you hit the starting gate. When did you know it was time for you to hang up your hat? I guess, I felt like I had done everything that I wanted to do, and it was time to set down some roots. And yeah, I missed being on the circuit, but... I never regretted it. You know what... I have something for you. Hang on. - Your lucky pin. - Yeah. Wore it in every race after I won my first medal. Except one, I forgot it at home. - The Swiss Downhill in '84? - Yeah. Yeah. This brought me a lot of luck. I put it in a drawer the day we bought this place, and now it's yours. Go on. I should've given it to you years ago. I guess... I was trying to hold on. Thanks, Dad. I will say this though, Justin. When the time does come for you to call it a day... it'll be very clear. - Kayla. Hi. - Oh hey. - We sort of met the other day. - No, of course. I remember. I'm actually glad I ran into you. - Can we go somewhere and talk? - Sure. I know a place. - Oh amazing. - How are you doing? Fine. And you've got some great training courses here so I'm doing a bit of a trial with Al Fielding. He trains Hunter Davies, and we wanted to see if he'd be a good fit. - He's one of the very best. - He is. Yes. And I'm just not feeling him at all. You know, he... Well, Hunter requires a lot of attention. - He's a star. - Yeah, but so are you. Maybe so, but that's not what it's about for me. Yeah. It's a delicate balance. - I know that can be very hard. - Yeah. What's even harder is just trying to find the right coach. It's like a marriage, you know? If only there was an app to help you find your mate. Well, my dad said, a key to a good pairing is just when you each bring something to the table that the other can benefit from. And what do you bring to the table? Sorry? I've been doing some poking around. Asked a few questions about you and I like what I'm hearing. From who? Well, Tom O'Neill, for starters. He thinks the world of you. And I've always thought the world of him. I used to watch him when he trained with your father. Yeah. They were quite a team. Yes, they were. He also mentioned that you're something of a temporary coach for Justin O'Neill. This is true. We've known each other forever and I used to coach him back in the day. What about after the Classic? Are you going to continue with him? I... don't know. I mean, I run the ski school and I coach the junior racers... I've been watching you this week, and I think you're a real talent. Thank you. Look, I leave early Sunday morning for the Zurich Invitational next week. Then onto Courchevel to train. I've got a place out there and I would love for you to come on board as my coach. Nancy, I am so flattered, I... but I can't leave Justin right before the race. I know. It's a lot to ask. But you did your job and you did it well. I watched him out there today, he's ready. So the thing to consider is... what's the next step for you? Why don't you think about it and we can talk later? Do you have a few minutes to talk? Can I come over? Yeah. I'm on the patio in front of the Lodge. Hey. Hey. Hey. You know, I was just thinking about something - my dad said to me. - What's that? He said, "you'll know when it's time." Time for what? The next chapter. And I'm ready. I'm ready. There is no roots for me in New York. I want a life, I want a family. I want to ski all day and sit out here at night. Everything I care about is right here. Nothing has ever been more clear. I need to tell you something. Nancy Sieber asked me to be her coach. That's... not what I was expecting you to say. You have to do it, Kay. It's your turn. That's what I came to tell you. I mean, I just need to see or else... I'll always regret it. You are gonna be so great. There's more. She's leaving Sunday morning before the race. She, she just needs a few days in Zurich to acclimate and prep for the Invitational. Then onto her place to train in France. That's really short notice. I feel so terrible leaving you like this. Don't. Don't. I'm ready, Kay, because of you. You got me back. Well, you know, I want you to run the course tomorrow, but don't over do it. And I am available by phone in the morning before we get on that plane by 9:00. It's okay, believe me. There is nothing my dad would love more than to take over my last day of training. You know, I can come back in the off-season. It doesn't have to be the end. I don't wanna hold you back. This life can take over, and I want you to experience everything it has to offer. I love you. I've always loved you, Justin O'Neill. Me too. Just wish we could have figured it out sooner. We're gonna miss you around here. I talked to the parents of the Mountain Junior Racers, they're so thrilled that Jenny is taking over. Good. Well, they might change their minds after the first couple of lessons. - Stop it. - You're gonna be great. And I'm always here to help. It's going to be so quiet without her. I'm even going to miss her snoring. - Oh stop. - Okay. She's not gonna have time to miss me because she has a Wyatt now. Now listen, you call us anytime, Kayla. - For anything. - We mean that. I cannot thank you enough for all that you've do for us. Thank you for all you've done for Justin. Can you go easy on him? Hey, easy doesn't win races. What? I'm kidding. Come on. You got him where he needs to be, and Tom will gently guide him over the finish line. But quickly... I love you. Take good care. Alright, I'm going home to pack, - You ready? - Yeah. How was it? Justin that was good. A minute, fourteen. Looked a little icy up there. Not my best time. - I'm gonna take one more run. - No. Don't overdo it. You wanna be fresh for tomorrow. Dad, I gotta shave some time off. What you're gonna do, is you gonna trust yourself, huh? You're a champion. You're gonna shave off more time when it counts. You've got this. Son... you do. You've got this. You all packed? All packed and ready with a shiny, new passport. Remind me to renew mine. Because I am gonna come and visit you in Europe. Any time. - Are you excited?! - Yeah. - You paused. - I was breathing. It was a pause slash breath. Are you sure this is really what you want? Yeah. It was just hard saying goodbye to Justin last night. But it's not goodbye forever. You know, it's just goodbye for now. The day we have all been waiting for is finally here, as we are now just hours away from the 55th Annual Winter Classic Men's Downhill. The pancakes give me a little bit extra weight. I ate too much. Conditions are perfect. No kidding. They're good. Yeah, conditions look good out there, and I'll definitely be able to handled it now that I'm part of the Snow Voltz Team. Congratulation. Oh thank you. Thank you. I'm very proud. They told me he hadn't decided. - He clearly has now. - Don't let it throw you. They aren't the only game in town. There are other sponsors here. I'm fine. It's okay. Everything that doesn't serve you up there is just noise. - Block it out. - Consider it blocked. How are you feeling, Justin? I got a good night's sleep. Knee is strong. - I'm ready to go. - I'm loving the confidence. So what do have to you say to all those people who have chosen Hunter Davies as the favorite to win today? I'd say... the final race of a man's career should be one for the books. So stay tuned. Justin are you announcing your retirement? - 'Scuse me. - Thank you very much. Justin, are you retiring? - Justin, one more comment? - You're sure? - Yep. - We had a good run. We had a great run. Okay. Let's go get you ready. Let's do this. So you ready to start this adventure? - Yes, I am. - This is a bit of a whirlwind, but I want you to know that I have a good feeling about this. Thank you so much for believing in me. Yeah. So I wanna go over the rankings in the car and develop a strategy. You'll see there's not a lot of air - between first and third place... - Right. And I intend to crack that. I know, it's hard to leave home. I feel that way every time. No, I'm fine. We're gonna get you on top. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yes. Okay. So, Renata Verini had a great run in Finland, but hasn't been able to crack the top three since. It's a beautiful day here on Winter Mountain and the 55th annual Winter Classic! Today the question on everybody's mind is, Can three time Classic Gold Medal Winner, Justin O'Neill, pull an upset over the current odds-on favorite, newcomer Hunter Davies. Our first racer on the day, Lars Edmund, Has the most career firsts place wins of anyone in this years Winter Classic. And he's off! Anthony Norman another first-timer for this Classic, has yet to place in the top three since joining the professional circuit in 2019. Justin, mo matter what happens here, you've had a career to be proud of. I learned from the best. Okay. Remember you stay high in that turn on the forth knoll. - Great. - Hey... - go get 'em. - Alright. Hunter Davies to the start gate. Hunter Davies to the start gate. Hey. Good luck. May the best man win. It's been an exciting Classic with only six tenths of a second separating fourth place from first, with only two racers to go. Hunter Davies determined to make a good showing in his first Classic is favorite to win today's race based on his current rankings. Hunter Davies the youngest member of the US Ski Team, takes the lead! That was an amazing run! Justin O'Neill to the start gate. Justin O'Neill to the start gate. Yeah. That's right! Oh boy. And our last racer of the day, three time Winter Classic Champion, Justin O'Neill. Who just today announced his retirement from the circuit. Can he bring home win number four. One last time. - Good start. Good start. - Good start. This is the Justin O'Neill we all remember before taking that spill in Austria. Come on, Justin. Come on. Justin O'Neil is looking better than ever, folks! And if he's able to maintain this pace rounding that final turn we could have an upset here. - Come on, Justin! - He's on fire! Atta boy, J! Yes! Yes! Yes! In an incredible upset, Justin O'Neill, who just today announced his retirement, has overtaken Hunter Davies and set a new course record to win the Winter Classic! Yeah! You did it! You did good. You did it! What a race! It was good luck. No. You didn't need the luck. - You were amazing. - Thank you, Mom? I'll be back. What are you doing here? What... what about Nancy and Zurich and... She went on to Zurich without me, but she'll be back after the race. 'Cause she's gonna train here with me. - Really? - Yes! 'Cause I'm gonna be a professional coach. And I'm gonna do it here from Winter Mountain. I mean, after all we do have the best training courses around. That, we do. So, it really is true... you can have roots and your dreams. That's my plan. This is where I belong. This is where we belong. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
