Bye! Bye. Aww. Bye sweetheart. Do I get a fist bump? Nice. High five? Awesome. I'll miss you, Miss Carter. Aw, I'll miss you too. Bye. Bye! Well that's the last of 'em. You know what time it is now? It's party time. Well I really miss you. Me too. I...I'm really glad you had time to talk, I just wish you could have come out here, you know, it's so beautiful. I wish I could have made it work with my schedule. Say, isn't there a going away party being thrown in your honour? Yeah. I mean I could go to the party or I could stay here with you. Kate, anybody could walk in. I know. You know, we could... Are you okay? Yeah, that's why I always keep an emergency water handy. Heh. I love you One-Week-From-Now- Mrs-Cholowski. Aww, I love you too, Current-And-Forever- Mr-Cholowski. I should go. Enjoy your party. Okay. I'll see you soon, honey. Bye. Amazing. Hey! We were... we were dancing. Uh, Kate! Uh, I guess this is your last weekend of freedom. Well I always wanna think of myself as free, whether I'm married or not, Mr Shay. You know, it's a party, you're leaving tomorrow, I'm not your assistant principle anymore. You know, I want you to think of me as Joe. Okay. And I know you have an interest in literature, you know, and back at mine I have some first editions that I would love to show you. Uh, well I'm sure your first editions are um, impressive... you know have my own waiting for me back home. So... Joe you sly fox, you hitting on Miss Katie again? Uh, yes, yes I was, but I had a better line this time. I've been working on it, and oh, I'm being dragged away now, yeah, okay. Thank you. Sorry. I have no idea how to explain what that was. It's...it's okay, I'm used to it by now, and to be fair, he did put a little bit more effort into it; this time it wasn't all just smiling and, you know, bumping against me, so. Yes, he is getting better. Yeah. As we all are, thanks to you. Aw, you're sweet. I gotta go do something. Now, come this way. Oh... Excuse me, everyone? As we all know, tonight is our last night with Kate. She's leaving us tomorrow morning, back to civilization, and to her family, and to get married. We wanna thank you for coming up all the way to our little community and giving of yourself. It takes a special person to come up here and live and work with us out of the goodness of their heart. 'Cause we know it's not for the money. It's not for everyone, but you fit right in, and we really wish we could talk you into coming back to us. Me too. Kate, although it's only been a short time, we will miss you. We love you, and you will always be a part of our family. Alright, enough of this, let's dance! Man, now that was some storm last night, huh? You're waking up to a record snowfall, Sorenson Lake, be prepared folks, our little town is buried, it's gonna be days before we get everything up and running again. On the bright side though, if you're already, you know, toasty warm at home, maybe still in bed, stay there. No one's gonna be working today. Stay tuned for more updates. Coming up next in sports, top of the hour, we'll--. Great. Hello. Hi. Uh, excuse me. Are you the pilot? When do we leave? Do I look like a pilot? Okay...uh, so where are the pilots then? Do you see a runway out there? Uh, nope. Because it's under three feet of snow. They can't land the plane or take off without a runway, hence, no pilots. Okay, but I, I have a ticket for a flight that leaves today, to Snowy Pines. Yeah, so do I. Uh, I...I'm getting married in a couple of days, in Snowy Pines. Hah. Good luck with that. Hey! Where, where are you going? Will you just, can you just stop for a second? Ow! Ah! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You, you were just gonna leave me here, you can't just leave me here. Who throws a candle? I just really need to get to Snowy Pines. Lady, I mind my own business. Okay, well so do I, but sometimes, I like to help people. Lady. Okay. When do you think the runways are gonna be open. A week. A week. What about the roads. 72 hours. 72 hours? I don't, haha, I don't have 72 hours, so what am I supposed to do here? Are you, are you going on this thing? Will you take me with you? Why don't I just go with you, I will pay you. I'm sorry, no. I don't need the extra baggage. Hello. I'm Kate Carter, I'm a teacher at Kamatnak. Is it...Preston? Hi Preston, uh, hey, you wouldn't happen to have this snowmobile for sale, would ya? So, as we've discussed, we're thinking that maybe we could start here and then go back out through the other side. Uh, Cindy! Cindy, what are you doing, I told you that the sign, it hangs in the centre, above to cover the... We can actually hang the sign here--. Excuse me. Cindy! Your sister's wedding, hello? Pastor dude told me I can't stick anything on that Holy guy. I don't know what to do with all that stuff. Diane, why is he not cooperating with us, this was supposed to be a done deal, gah, when is Kate gonna be here? Brad went to pick her up at the airport. Well, I should hope so. Because I am tired of all this falling on to me. You know, 'cause I don't need this. I'm married already, am I not married already? Are you giving me a choice, dear? That is not funny, do not say that, none of you are funny. Nobody listens to me, you're all against me, and I don't know why--. Brad, Brad! Where's Kate? Everything's fine, she's just gonna be a little bit late. Late? How late? Well... Alright. Hey, uh, so some bad news. Got a pretty bad storm up here, so no planes in or out. Probably no graters on the road for 72 hours, so I'm gonna jump on my sled. It's about a three day trek. I won't have any cellphone reception so I'll call you when I can, but I'll be there. Look, I'm not asking for any favours. You're not even gonna know I'm there, I'm just gonna follow you. No. Well you can't stop me. What are you gonna do with that? Huh? Are you gonna shoot me? Is Mr Big Man here gonna shoot me, is that what you're trying to say? 'Cause I don't scare that easily, Mr Big Man. Go back! Jerk! Ahhh!! Are you okay? Damn. Come on. Get off me! What was that all about!? I saved your life! Is that what that was? Well you're alive, aren't you? This whole thing is your fault! Lady, I told you to go home! What is wrong with you, lady? This place is known as the Deep Valley to the locals, they know it, you can leave your bags and hire somebody to come get them. Why don't you just let me ride on the back of that thing, and then as soon as we get to Snowy Pines I will hop off, I will pay you some money. No, I don't want your money. Okay, look, I'm sorry. I should not have tried to follow you, but you can't blame a girl for wanting to get to her wedding on time, and, and, and now we're both here and we both need to get to Snowy Pines, so--. You know what, I have an idea. Why don't you just push your wedding. You can't, you can't push a-- you can't push a wedding! There are guests coming in, there's flowers that are supposed to be arriving today, the venue's been booked for like a year, where are you going, come on. Will you please please please please, will you please just just take me on your snow thingy? You, come on, you can't just leave me--. Come on! Really!? One bag. One bag. No more hitting. No hitting. And do us both a favour, no more talking. I, 'kay, I am mute. You're the one who insisted, at considerable expense I might add, that the muffs be real fur. Yes well in your vast experience in dealing with muffs, dear, don't you think it's best to stick to the real thing? Uh, okay, so here's the latest. She's on her way here now, and she's still riding a snowmobile with a guy, but they'll be here in three days and she says not to cancel anything. Dear Lord. Do you have any idea how this affects me? Yes dear. It's all about you. What else? Just that she's sorry she's not here yet, and she knows it's a major inconvenience, for you especially. Uh...just don't cancel anything. She'll deal with whatever's left when she gets back. Okay. I'll um, I'll deal with the planner. Uh, Brad, why don't you go to your future mother-in-law, and comfort her. Cindy! Uh, so...you....don't. Don't? Don't. Whose...whose place is this? No idea. But it's shelter. Think you can manage to start a fire? Uh-huh, yep. Alright, kindling's there. I'll go and get some more firewood. Okay. Oh, ugh. Hmm. Kate! Kate! Still nothing. Still nothing. Three things to make a fire. Fuel. Spark. Oxygen. That's it. For your face. I guess I'll sleep on the floor. Um, that's okay, I, I--. No, I'll go get my sleeping bag. You just...take that. Damn light. Son of a--. No, you know what, let me do it. Okay, how do I, uh... Remove one of the necessary elements. There you go. Congratulations. Redford? What? Thank you. Goodnight. Night. Ohh. Alright. Ooh, that's cold. Ohh. Redford! Redford! Lady, come on! You couldn't choose a better time than this? Ugh! In or out, cowboy, you're letting the cold in. Well, looks like we got ourselves a menage a travoir here. This one here is yours I suppose? What do you think this heres pelt's worth? I'm not in the fur business. Well, take a guess. I don't speculate. My cabin, my rules, cowboy. What do you think this pale quiver in the corner's worth, in the open market? I'm guessing not much. I'm guessing you're right. You can go, missy. You--I--I can just go? Yeah, go, get out of here, get on that machine of yours, and get the hell out of here and off my trap line. Come on, let's go. Ah-ah! Not you, cowboy. You stay put. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Do I look like I'm kidding? Yeah, okay. Oh! I need the keys. Give her the keys. Thanks. It's harsh. Ah. I had a good day today. Really I did. But I didn't think it was gonna turn out this good. Come on, you got a pretty mouth. It's just you and me. Really cold outside. Huh? We're far far away from everything. God damn it lady we had a deal! Let's go, let's go! What's she worth to you? Oh, not much. What are you upset about, it's not your hide he was interested in! Ah! Don't go, cowboy! I got the coonskins in there if you wanna stay! Ugh! Fox pelts! Beaver!! Ugh. I'm so lonely. I can't believe that your heap of a fire is still burning. Well I can't believe you left my bags back there. The one thing we've learned is to not leave me in charge of building fires. Yeah. But that looks good on you. Better on you than me. What a night. I'm starving. There's some beef jerky in that bag. So? What's your story? Wha...what story? Well I mean you live out in the middle of nowhere because...? Because it suits me? Okay, well what do you do? About what? For a living. I don't ask pointless questions, how about that? Ah, okay. Well in my experience guys like you live out--gah, out in the middle of nowhere for two reasons. One is money, and the other is to be alone, so I'm guessing a bit of both with you. Uh, are you a...oil rigger? Um, miner? Construction worker, mechanic? No, and why don't you just stop talking? So we can take Public Relations off the list? And what about you? What about me? What's a rich city girl doing living out in Sorenson Lake? What? Well I mean you got a $10,000 ring on. Well I didn't buy it. Okay, so he's the rich one, yeah. I teach out here because I wanna make the community better. Helping people is what matters to me. It's 15, by the way. 15 what? The ring. You were impressively close though. They've gone up in price. Oooh, well there's a little crack in the armour. Stoic Redford bought a diamond, but I'm guessing not for the girl you're about to go see. What's her name? Jodi. Jodi. Hmm. Does she spell it with an 'i' or a 'y'? With an 'i'. Does she dot her 'i' with a little heart? She work at Hooters? I'm sorry, I'm not being nice. It's fine, 'cause nice won't get you across the river. And being a jerk will? I guess we'll see, won't we. You...you go make yourself comfortable. Okay. I'll do all the hard work, that's fine. Okay, thanks. Stop! What, no, we got ground to cover--. I have to pee. No, no, before dark, if we don't make it--. Okay, it's your jumpsuit, let's keep going then. I'll be five minutes. Less. Ugh. Redford! My zipper's stuck, can you help me? Come on, hurry. Come on. Alright. What are you-- oh, God. Just... Okay. There. Thanks. Think you can handle it from here? Yeah. Okay, go away. Ugh, come on, you've got to be kidding me. Ugh. Come on. Okay, got it. Ah! What are you doing, get off me! Shh, do not move. Play dead. I don't have to pee anymore. Well...better some beans and fruit than us, right? I don't think it would have been much of a question on which one of us it was. I guess now we're on foot. Come on. Okay. Woops. We lost? Ugh. We'll have to cross it. We go around, it'll add an extra day. And we don't have the food, or we'll probably freeze, too. I also have to be at the church in two days, so yeah, let's go. We gotta turn back. What? Hey, why? I've seen carsgo across lakes before, one guy even had a motor home. It's gotta be like, two feet of ice under us. Yeah, but somewhere between here and that shore, this two feet of ice is gonna go down to a quarter of an inch. I say we cross it. Yeah well I didn't ask you. Well I don't wait to be asked, sometimes. Listen, lady, my hide is mine to lose or save, yours? See, this is exactly why I mind my own business. Now you're my responsibility. I'm not your responsibility, okay? I'm a big girl, I decided to come on this trip. All I'm saying is, if you're willing to try, then I'm willing to try. You realize if we go through, there's no going back. Yes, I realize that. Okay. Okay. It'll be fine. Come on. You're so pessimistic. Hey. Hi, Edward. I know, Brad, that you're sick with worry, I know exactly how you feel. I don't know what to do. I was thinking maybe we should send out a search party, or something? We've been through a lot, you and me. I think it's time I show you a special little something. I learned this along the way, go ahead, take your socks off, come on now. Okay. Now see, some men prefer scotch, other men prefer golf. Even others prefer the, well the company of prostitutes. I'm gonna show you my little secret that I use every time I just can't take it anymore. Now put your feet flat on this carpet, and now, take a breath, and try to pick it up with your toes as you exhale. You see? Di thinks I made this up but I actually saw it in a movie. This is really good. Mm. Poor Kate. You need to stay at least four feet back, alright? Okay, Mr Know-It-All. So, let me guess, are you a nature guy? No. Handyman? Janitor? Garbage collector? You really have a low opinion of me, don't you lady? Skate sharpener, professional snowshoe-er, birthday clown. If I tell you will you please shut up!? Yes! Fine. I spend my time in the woods, quietly, avoiding women like you--. Redford. Redford?! Redford, listen, the ice is cracking! Ah! Oh my God. Get up. Okay. Get up, come on, we gotta get up. We gotta go. We gotta get dry. Come on. Here we are. Redford? Redford, come on. Okay. Light a fire. Light a fire. Okay. Okay, come on. Ah! I'm so cold, so cold... Okay, I got this. Oh. Get a fire going. Come on. So cold. Ugh. Okay, come on, come on, I got a fire going. Come on, let's go. You did good. Thank you. Hi. This is insane. I don't know where she is, when she's gonna be back, if she's gonna be back, or even if she's still alive you know sometimes I think she does these things to me on purpose I mean how am I supposed to--. You're tense. Oh, God that's good. You need to relax. Yeah. You're right, I just need to relax. Woah, woah hey, ha, maybe not that relaxed. Brad, you're almost family. What could be more right than comforting each other in our hour of need? I, Cindy, I don't think Kate would go for this. Are you saying that my sister is selfish enough to deprive her husband-to-be of solace when she herself has gone missing? Oh, you make a good point. No, this isn't right. Besides, would Kate do this. Oh, oh my God, don't do that, ha. Are you gonna stop me? Oh, oh. Ahh! Oh my God, I am so sorry, are you, here, let me just--. Ow!! I think it might be broken. Sorry. Alright, put that up there like that, and you can just spin around. Excuse me? What are you--. Oh. If we leave the fire in damp clothes, we'll freeze in a matter of hours. Don't worry, you'll be next. Uh, yeah, you wish. You ain't got nothin' I haven't seen before. How do you know what I have and haven't got? Basic anatomy. You should probably allow an inch or so for shrinkage, probably two. Oh. What is it with men? You're just always obsessed with measuring your peens. Right, and you women aren't worried about your cup sizes, huh? Earlier I had you pegged for an ample B, but now I'm thinking maybe a small B. Uh, excuse me, I am a full B, thank you very much. Right, well I'll believe that when I see it. Well, dream on. Okay. Ugh. Don't turn around. So I should probably say... that you were right. And I was wrong. And I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I would have done it wether or not you were with me, so I'm sorry. Well, this is awkward. Yes. Yes it is. Dr Till to admission. Dr Till to admission. Kate? Hi Katie, it's dad. Of course I'd be interested in a free trip to the Bahamas. I can't see nothin'. I'm goin' in. Any excuse to get naked. Okay, 'kay, can you just leave your underwear on, please? I don't want to see any dangly bits if you need rescuing. Yeah? You sure? Ugh. Ah. Wait wait wait wait wait. What? What, come on lady, it's freezing out here! Okay, can you stop it, with the 'lady' thing? I know you're trying to be a big man, and everything, but it's a little demeaning, just... come back, okay? Yeah well if I don't get food or more clothes, I might as well not come back, so. Okay, well, give 'er. Thanks. Ah, okay. Hmm. Would you like a piece of my dehydrated banana? What do you think Jodi would say about that? I'm sure she'd say 'better you than me.' Well she sounds like a special lady. That she is. Well, we have some clothes, we have some food, and... Ah-ah, that is not for you. Redford, I didn't know you knew how to read, and Emmerson no less, huh. Yeah, there's a lot of things that I know how to do that you don't know about. Okay. You know, you'll get yourself into trouble some day if you keep thinking you know more than you do. To be great is to be misunderstood, is that it? None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding, except he who listens to the whisper, which is heard by him alone. Hmm. That's nice. I haven't heard that one before, I'm impressed. And what were you expecting? Oh, I don't know, maybe a little Louis L'Amour. I like Louis L'Amour. You do! Surprise surprise. I suppose you're all Margaret Atwood-y, huh? Oh woman is woe--. You know Margaret Atwood isn't all--. Oh, I'm sure when no one's looking you're watching Sex in the City re-runs. Heh. You know, I have to say I'm a little surprised that you know who Margaret Atwood even is. Yeah? Well it's really gonna break you off when I tell you I prefer Margaret Laurence. 'Break you off'? You can't talk about female authors all intelligently and then say something like 'break you off.' You lose all ground that way. I was... I was making ground? No. Oh, I think I was. Well you weren't. I think I was. How long do you think we could survive out here? I don't know. But I don't get the feeling that I'm about to die. I think if uh... if we stick together, we stand a pretty good shot. Mm. Good morning. Morning. Okay. Ugh. Ohh yeah. What are you doing? You gotta try this. Yeah, no, I don't. Oh come on. Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air. No thanks. What, you don't wash your face in the morning? Yeah I wash my face. With glycolic acid cleanser for sensitive skin, and warm shower water. Oh, no, no no no no no. No? No. Why no? Cold showers are the only way to go. Yeah. Bet you need a lot of cold showers. Ooh. And your fiance, does he enjoy glycolic sensitive skin--. Get out of my way. Oh God. Ohh-ho-ho this is so cold. Oh my God. Oh, uh. That'll wake you up. I think, I think you probably missed a spot. No no no, I didn't miss-- Don't. Alright, okay. Showers are over. So what's for breakfast big man? Well it definitely won't be eggs and toast. Well that's okay 'cause I don't like eggs and toast. Oh good. 'cause there is no food. You mean there's nothing? No. Well, that's not good. Especially when we're planning on crossing the Snowy Pines Plain on foot. Sounds to me like you didn't plan that one out very well there, nature boy. What? Ohh, you are--. Don't. Come here. Come here. Stop! Come on, Kate. Come on, Kate, stay with me. I don't think I can take another step. Just a few more steps, come on, come on, we can do this. We're just over there. Okay. Okay. Looks like rig watch. There's probably only one camp attendant left behind. I'll steal us some wheels, you steal us some food. Yeah, okay, I'm not stealing anything, let's just go in there and ask them for a ride. Don't you have some place you need to be tomorrow? 'Cause I know I do. Okay, right, they're gonna shut down at the cost of tens of thousands of dollars just so they can give us a ride back into town. We'd probably have to wait a few days for the next guy to show up and then go in to town with him. Okay, well I'm not doing that, that's ridiculous. Just... leave it up to me. I will get us...home. Yeah right. Hello? Hello? Just gonna grab some stuff. How's it goin'? Redford, Redford, Redford, gotta go. Gotta go gotta go gotta go. What's going on? Is that your carpool, captain? Take this. No really, we'll just... we'll just ask him for a ride, can we get a ride, sir, in the middle of nowhere? Just start this thing. Alright, whatever. Let's do this. Shit. You should have seen the look on your face. 'Oh yeah, I'll take care of this, yeah.' Yeah, okay, I had everything under control. Oh, yeah. Clearly. Clearly. How far away do you think we are? Well, um, I mean we're making good time, it can't be more than a few hours, and... or not. What, what's wrong, what is it? Well we're almost out of fuel. Are you kidding me?! Well it's not like I really had time to fuel up while you were being chased, you were running, you were screaming, there was that underwear guy. I got nothin'. Shit. Uh, what's happening? Well, how do your walking legs feel? Oh, come on, are you serious? Yeah, yeah I am. There's a town up ahead, it's about an hour's walk--. I can't do this, I'm so tired. Oh, I think you'll manage. Excuse me. We need two rooms. I've only got one room left. But... very special. Very nice. Heh. You two crazy kids look like you're up for an adventure. Oh to be young again. You've got to be kidding me. So... are you gonna go first? Huh? Shower. Warm up. Oh. Uh, yeah. I'll go first. No, that's not happening. Heh. Uh... I'm uh...my turn. Okay. Hey sis. Hey Cindy, is mom around? She's saying goodbye to Uncle Dave. Where are you? It's a long story, but we're in a motel, and I'll be home in the morning. We? I see what's going on. One last fling before the ring? That is not what's going on. Is he hot? What!? No! I mean he's... well he's handsome, but that, that... can you just put mom on the phone? He is totally hot. 'Kay, you're being ridiculous, just tell mom that I am very tired, and I need someone to come and pick me up from this motel in the morning and take me home, okay? Okay, have fun. Yeah, thanks, and tell Brad that um... I'll see him tomorrow. 'In a world of conformity the hardest goal is to be yourself.' Whatcha' doin'? Kate? What's going on? What is wrong with you, lady? I'm sorry I got so caught up in this. I know better. I was this close to throwing my life away, and yours. You went through my stuff?! You are unbelievable. you're all the same, aren't you? Why can't you just mind your own business?! Now I know why you live out in the middle of nowhere. And if you ask me, that's exactly where you belong. I live out in the middle of nowhere to avoid women like you! This is why Brad is perfect. Just go. Sometimes all you get is the honeymoon. Happened to me, believe it or not. Good morning. Hi. Welcome home. Thank you. Tired. And beautiful. I missed you. I missed you too. It was too long. No more, okay? Okay. Promise? I promise. You've had quite an adventure over the last few days. What the hell happened? God, um, well, let's see. Uh, I was chased by a disturbingly lonely fur trapper, um, a naked rig worker, and a giant bear. A bear. Yeah. A bear chased you. Uh-huh. I also may have stolen a ham. And a SnowCat. We crashed into this frozen lake and I almost froze to death, and I almost blew myself up. Oh my God. Yeah. Poor thing, I can't believe all that happened to you in the last few days. Yeah. Heh. I... I guess it is kind of crazy when you think about it, but it was actually kind of fun. And exciting, in the moment. I mean I wasn't even really thinking, you know, we were just doing what needed to be done. Well I'm just glad you're home and safe. I don't know what I'd do without you. Nothing will ever happen to you again. They seem to be getting along a little too well. Yeah, they are. It's almost disturbing. So, what happened to Cindy's face? Oh, I don't know. But as usual her timing's impeccable. Did you get enough sleep? Mmhmm. Liar. You know, I seldom worry about you, but this time, I must say, I'm glad you're here. You are here, aren't you? Of course. Does this have anything to do with the adventurer who led you out of Egypt or Canin or wherever it was you were? No. Maybe. Kate. In less than six hours you're going to make a promise to love, honour, and obey Brad as long as you both shall live. After having been through the adventures you've been through over the past few days, I can understand it may not be something one wants to jump right into. If you wanna postpone this afternoon and just leave it for another day, I would find it quite a reasonable thing to do. I'm afraid I don't have a very good grip on reasonable right now. Well that's why you have me. Thanks mom. Did you have any second thoughts about marrying dad? Ha! Of course I did. He's insane. But he's what I really wanted. Make sure that Brad's what you really want. I think he is. Does this adventurer have a name? Redford. McMillan. Redford McMillan? Mmhmm. Like the author? What author? Well it's not like he's on the best selling list or anything, but I really like his work. "As in all things, the blessings of nature abound." No. Lucky girl. Mom. I'm just saying. You know, there's a McMillan residence across the street from my office. Sorry. So sorry to disturb you. Straight to the church then? Yes, thank you. Actually, can we make a quick detour first? Hi. Hello. Um, I'm looking for Redford? Redford's my son. I'm Jodi. Big day, huh? Uh, yeah, today's the big day. Uh, is Redford--. He's just stepped out. Okay. You're Kate, right? Yeah, that's me. That was quite the adventure you had getting down here. Redford told me all about it. So he came to see you. He's never missed my birthday. That's sweet. Redford should be back soon, I'm not sure where he is. He likes to mind his own business. Yes he does. Um, I really have to get going. But you should know that your son saved my life, like, 20 times. He's a really good man. He is. Most of the time. Most of the time. You're right. Can I ask you, who's the little girl? Oh, that's... that's a complicated story. That's really good, Alice. You're such a good colourer, and you're getting to be so big. Thanks! Alice, why don't you go play on the slides in the play room? Mummy and Mr McMillan have some things they need to talk about in private. Okay mommy. Mr McMillan? Really? That's a bit cold, even for you. I don't know what to call you, you're not her father. I was her father, for three years. She seems to be doing well. How are you? Good. We're really good. I'm happy for you. I was surprised. Shocked, actually, to hear from you. I thought maybe it was time. I guess I at least owe you that much. You know, I'm really sorry for the way everything turned out. It was never about you. Redford, I never thought he was coming back. I know. I know. And I'm sorry. For the way I handled things. I truly am. How are you? Uhh, you know, I'm fine. What's her name? Whose name? She's with someone, and it's none of my business. You made me your business when I wasn't. We're not all the same. That. I'll take that. Okay, see you in there. Katie, you look beautiful. I need to talk to Brad. Well, he's just a few steps away, and you can talk to him as much as you want then. Ready? Please be seated. Dearly beloved. We are gathered here in the presence of God and these witnesses, to sanctify the joining of Brad and Kate in Holy matrimony. Marriage is commendable in the eyes of God. Kate, Brad, as you move forward, may you look forward to each new season of your marriage, much as the world looks forward to the new seasons of the year, for each season brings with it new moments, memories. The key to a good marriage is to have a strong bond, friendship, and trust. It's an adventure, one that only the two shall share. An adventure. I can't. I'm so sorry, Brad. I can't do this. I think, I think you are an amazing man, but... Kate, I thought we had a plan. We did. We did have a plan, that's part of the problem, we were always just following the plan. I know I went up North, but you never once came to see me. I just wanted you to have what you wanted. I know. But I think that's what you wanted. I thought I wanted that but I don't. I'm so sorry, Brad. I can't do this. Katie? Katie! She's doing the right thing. You poor baby. Hmm. What happened to minding your own business? What do you think I'm doing, lady? You are my business. Ah! What the hell? You ruined my wedding! I... I guess it's not a bad thing. Let's get out of here. Yeah. Well you didn't think this through, look what I'm wearing. I always got your back. Ha! I'm driving. It's all yours, lady. Woah, woah! Holy, lady! Are you okay? Have I not taught you better than this, come on! Okay, hold on! There you go. Give it a little throttle. You need a new snowmobile, it's not me, it's this thing!
