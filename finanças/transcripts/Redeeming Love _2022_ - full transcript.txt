We found gold, boys! Lucky seven. - Oh, yeah. - Oh! Oh, this is it. Uh-huh. I have the number. - I have the number. - Yeah. Who do you think is gonna get a turn with her tonight, boys? - Yeah, come on! - Number one? Never been number one before. Number one! Yeah, boys! Winning number, I got 15! It's gonna win! Fun tonight, boys. - Hey. Give it back! - No, no, no. That's the winning ticket! Oh, Angel. - Angel. - My Angel! Angel! All right, all right! Vagabonds, show me your tickets! One more charmed man, then she's done shagging for the day. She's all worn out! I have plenty of other girls! Chinese, African, Spanish. Dealer's choice. But if you want Angel... ...you'll have to come back tomorrow. And by guess or by golly, it could be your lucky day. I have the lucky number! Forty-one! Yeah! Get off me! Sarah! I'm down here. Child, your mama wants to know if you got the flowers. Is he here? He'll be here soon. You must hurry. I'll pick more now. Thank you for getting these. You know how much I love flowers. I do. Now, blue is his favorite color. Remember to stand straight up and act like a lady. Sarah? Isn't she beautiful, Alex? Did you pick blue on purpose, Mae? Because it brings out the color in her eyes? - Cleo! - She's not here. I sent her to town. Well, that leaves us in a fix. Doesn't it? - Papa... - Don't call me that. Uh, I-I wanted to thank you for the gifts you send me. - Hush, Sarah. - What gifts? Tell me. I like the candies you send me. The best of all is the crystal swan. Indeed. I'm so pleased to know how much my gifts mean. Darling, go outside and play now. Find Cleo when she returns. Can't I stay? I want you to go outside to play. I want to talk with your mother alone. Can I come back once you're done talking? Your mother will come get you when she's ready. Now, run along. As you've been told. I brought back that swan from Europe for you, and you throw it away on a child. She is your daughter. I have enough children by my wife. Legitimate children. Do you know what it's like for me to walk down the streets in this town? I gave up everything for you. She should never have existed, Mae. I sent you to a doctor to get rid of that mess! You son of a bitch. You ungrateful bitch! Where have you been, darling? I've been looking all over for you. Is he coming back? Maybe not for a long time. Maybe not ever. I don't want him to. We'll have to wait and see. You father is a very busy and important man. What if I got sick and died? You're not gonna get sick and die. You're far too young and healthy for that. But, Mama... ...if I did, would he come back and stay with you? No. Don't you ever ask that question ever again. - Do you understand? - But... Never again. None of this has anything to do with you. I love you more than anything or anyone in this whole wide world. Angel? Angel! It's break time. My mother ran off when I was five. And my aunt took me in. Auntie Priscilla. She used a switch on me at least twice a day. Look. The bitch with a switch. She was the meanest woman I ever knew... meaner than the Duchess. She would make me cut a fresh switch from the tree in the front yard every day. So, one day, she was out having tea with her phony friends. So I took an ax, and I chopped the tree down. It went through the house, crushing her fancy-ass parlor. Yeah. God, I just wish I had've stuck around to see the look on Priss's face when she got home. And sometimes I wish that I could go back and say that I'm sorry. Maybe my life might've been different. How so? Well, might not have ended up here, you know... ...just being a mattress hole for whoremongers. Just collecting gold dust that isn't mine. My father sold me for three ounces of gold. And he told me that I was going to stay in a palace. I thought he meant a royal palace. Like a princess. It's bad. - Angel. - Hmm? You got any big plans? - Plans? - Yeah. You got to have plans, Angel. You got to hope for something more in this world outside of this... paradise. Hope for what? You can't get by without hope. I get by. How? Never look back, never look forward. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, boy. Great job. Come on. Lord, thank you for blessing the land that you have given me. May I always know, as I tend to each crop and creature, you're the one that helps them grow. Grant me strength and wisdom. Please protect the farm from harm. And thank you, Lord. Amen. Lord, I was, uh... I was hoping that... maybe you might give me a... I mean, provide me... ...with someone I can share this with. Some guidance. A sign. Anything. Maybe she likes fishing. You know, maybe she has long legs. Anyway, you... you know the kind I need. I trust you. What? Walk on. There she is. Ma'am. Ma'am. Look at that! Hey, back up. Stand back. She's something to see, ain't she? Who is she? That's Angel. Finest girl west of the Rockies. Every Monday and Friday afternoon, she takes walks. They all come out to watch her. I can see why her husband is armed. Oh, that ain't her husband. Bodyguard. No one gets within a foot of her for free. I have to meet her. You'll have to get in line. The Duchess holds a daily lottery to see who gets to spend quality time with her. A duchess? She owns the brothel up there. Palace. Hey, what, sh-she's a prostitute? Uh-huh. Lord, you most certainly have a sense of humor. That's the girl? What's that? Uh-uh-uh, nothing. - Been on that farm too long. - Yeah, let's settle up. Come on. Take it in the back. Whoa. I'm gonna tell you God's truth. All men want to do is use you. Your papa only cared about what your mama gave him. And she gave him everything she had. And now he kicks her out and cuts her off. When you give them your heart, they tear it to shreds. None of them care. These stones are green glass, not emeralds. You got anything else? No. Nobody cares about anybody in this world. There is another way. Just you and, uh... five easy dollars. Let's hop on one of those ships and sail away. Where would we go? Far... far away from here. Mm. Far away. That sounds nice. Mae! You got company. Why don't you think about where we would go, hmm? Come on, now. We don't have all day. Say my... my prayers with me, baby. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... ...and... ...and... Mama. Mama, wake up, please. Wake up. That is God's truth. Best you know that now, child. I paid! Let me in! Go to hell. Come on! Angel! Go to hell! I said go away. Fill the tub. You hiding something from me? Huh? Think you're so special? Better than me and everyone else around here? I know you're hiding something. Duchess said I'm off-limits to you. You pig. Let's go! Put me down! Put me down! Duchess! No, no, uh-uh-uh. Stay down! Huh? - Enough? - Enough. Huh? Come on, fight me! Come on! You have no idea how much pain I'm gonna wreak on you. - Do it. Do it! - Stop! She needs to be taught a lesson. I heard her screams from the hall. Men knew what you were doing to her, they'd hang you. I have extra rope if they're short. Not another word. Sober her up and talk to her. - You understand? - Yeah. Coffee and bread are on their way up. Make sure she takes it in. I need her ready to work in two hours. Not a mark on her. Not a mark. It's open. What's your pleasure, mister? Doesn't matter in here if you're married. Doesn't matter if your... Christian mama doesn't approve. There's no guilt in here, okay? Just pleasure. So don't be shy. Tell me what you want. You. I'm all yours. Why don't you come over here and I'll wash you. I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise. That won't be necessary, ma'am. "Ma'am"? Do I look like your mama? No, ma'am. No. You do not. The truth is, I... I didn't come here for... that. Yeah? I just came here to talk to you. You want to talk? There's a nice barkeep named Murphy downstairs. He'll talk your ear off. Y-You-you... you live in this room? No. My little white house surrounded by roses on top of the hill is where I prefer to stay. I shouldn't have come this way. What other way is there? Uh, I ain't sure. How old are you? I'm real old. How old are you? T-Twenty-six. Ancient for a gold miner. Oh, s... no, no, see. I-I ain't a miner. I-I work on a farm. Angel your real name? You can call me whatever you want. Well, my name is... I don't want to know your name. Michael Hosea. Are you afraid of what your wife might think if you have your way with me? Wife. No, see, 'cause, uh... I'm not married. But I will be soon. Then come over here and get your last taste of freedom while you can. Oh, no, I can't, you see, 'cause I'm... - gonna marry you. - Mm. You're gonna marry me? Take me away from here, give me the life I deserve? Mm-hmm. You're my fifth proposal this week. How about we do what's on your mind and we call it a day? I'm gonna give you a good life. Come on. Come away with me. Time's up. Come on. I'm coming back. All-all I ask for is-is-is one honest half hour. Five minutes with me, you'd run like the devil. Angel, Angel... Next time I pray to God for a woman to share my life, I'm gonna be a lot more specific. So you won the lottery again? I paid double again. Lucky me. I do hate to see you just waste your time and gold dust just... just chatting. Do you want to stay here for the rest of your life? I don't think that's really any of your business. It was my business the minute I saw you on the street. Yeah, love at first sight, right? Right. Oh, sorry. What, am I putting you to sleep now? All this talking is exhausting to be honest. So you'd rather I join you on the bed? At least you would've left having gotten something for your gold dust. Let me get you out of this place. I'm serious. Marry me. Time's up. Get your boots on. It's... It's time for you to go. Nice talking to you. She said no, again. Shocking. I don't know. Got enough gold dust for one more try. Maybe you need a new plan. Buy some cattle. It might've been cheaper. Go home, Michael. Work your farm. Ain't no woman worth that amount of gold. Mm. Angel, who's the man you were with last night? Which one? The good-looking one. All look the same to me. Six feet, dark hair, blue eyes. When he smiled at me, I could feel it all the way down to my toes. A pot-marked midget from Nantucket could smile at you, and you'd feel it all the way down to your toes. Drink your brandy, Lucky. No one was talking to you. I've had one untried boy after another. I would like to give a real man a go. Duchess said one glass per girl. Milk's expensive. So, you really don't care about him, Angel? You can have him. You'd be doing me a huge favor. Hey. Don't bother with Angel tonight, sugar. She wanted me to tell you that you'd like me a lot better. - Is that so? - Yeah. What else did Angel say? That I'd be doing her a huge favor to take the farmer boy off her hands. She said that? Yes. Never been with a woman like me before. And as far as I can tell, I never been with a man like you. You again. Your, um, your friend just met me downstairs. Told me you asked her to take me off your hands. I told you you'd be wasting your time and gold dust on me. Don't worry about me. I'm leaving town. Headed back to the valley. Back to the farm. Well, go ahead. I'm not stopping you. Do you like the view here? Slapped-up shacks? Drunk boys fighting in the mud? Men paying money to put their names into a hat so they get the chance to have sex with you? - I didn't ask you to care. - No, you didn't. No, 'cause you don't ask anything, do you? No, 'cause you don't need anything. Or maybe-maybe it's just 'cause you don't feel anything. That it? Wh-Why don't I just go to your friend's room, hmm? - Maybe she'll feel something. - That's a great idea. No, it is. She costs less, too. You might as well leave with a smile on your face. Oh, you want to see me smile? - Just say my name. - What is your name? Hmm? 'Cause I don't remember. It's Michael. Well, it's about time. No, stop. Hey, hey, stop. Hey, stop. Stop. We can't, we can't do this yet. - What do you mean "yet"? - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. We should wait till it means something to you. You're a damn fool. I feel nothing for you. Absolutely nothing. You're a dirt farmer. Yes, I am. Ain't Boston a grand city? Told your mother I would take good care of you. Come on. Upstairs. Second door on the right. My name is Sally. What's yours, honey? Oh, she's shy. Don't mind her. Take her home, please. Just get her out of here. Her mama's dead. She'll be better off here - in this fancy place with... - No. No, she won't. Oh, yeah. Oh, my. That's fine. Are you enjoying my brandy? Well, it's the best I've ever tasted. She's all yours. As soon as you pay me. What's her name? You can call her whatever you want. Take care of him. Come here. No, no. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't make a sound. Don't make a sound. Look. You'll drink when I pour you a drink. Go through the pockets before you dump the body, Colin. There might be something in there for you. Come here. Don't make me ask you again. You have the look of intelligence about you. What's your name? Never mind. You'll be my little Angel from now on. And as long as you do exactly what I tell you, we'll get along. "'He may live in my memory "'as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, "'but that is all. "'I have nothing either to hope or to fear "'and nothing to reproach him with. "'Thank God. I have not that pain. "'A little time, therefore... "I shall certainly try to get the better.' "With a stronger voice, she soon added, "'I have this comfort... imm-me...'" "Immediately." "Immediately"? "'I have this comfort immediately "'that has not been more than an error of fancy on my side... "'...and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.'" "'Do not give way to such feelings as these. "'They will ruin your happiness. "'It's very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.'" Alex. This is Angel. You are stunning. Have we ever met before? Could be. You look like... someone I used to know. Alex Stafford blew his brains out last night when he found out he had sex with his own daughter. Don't look back. Go. Now Angel's gone. She was last seen heading for the docks, and Captain Sorenson's ship left harbor yesterday. And who helped her get out of the house? Sally. Well, before you kill her, bring her to me. We could make a heap on this voyage to California. Look at them all. We might as well sell it. Better than having them take it for free. I have a guy who can handle our money. His cut is ten percent. You okay with that? I don't think I have a choice. Put her down! Found it. Let's go. Hurry. Here. You need a drink. No. You sure you're not sick? I was just thinking about my mother. What was she like? Beautiful. Shattered. You're clammy. I have a headache. How long's it been aching? Ever since that... farmer started badgering me. And you're sorry you didn't go with him? No. No. No man is gonna own me. Yeah. The Duchess wouldn't have let you go anyway. She can't keep me here. Like hell she can't. No, we have a deal. She holds my money, and then when I'm ready, I walk. The only girls who leave here are too old, too sick to work or dead. Who's there? Angel. Come in. You look dreadful. Something troubling you? You've been working me too hard. Nonsense. Sit down, darling. I heard you missed breakfast. Would you like something? I want my gold. And why do you want it? - Because it belongs to me. - Mm. Pour yourself some coffee. I don't want coffee. I want my gold. Tell me, why do you want your gold? I would like to leave, get my own place. Mm. Getting ambitious, are you? Trying to compete against me. No. Be a hundred miles from this place. You don't have to worry about me. I just would like to be left alone. I take good care of you, don't I? Huh? You'd be one woman fighting off a hundred men. How long would you last? Maybe I'll get... married or something. You fancy doing laundry and cooking for a man and giving him sex whenever and however he wants for free? You know how to make a man happy for 30 minutes. That's all you're good at. I want my gold, Duchess. You are forgetting what I do for you. Everything costs money. You wear silk in a mining town. I provide protection for you. I feed you. You live in a nice building. Is my name on the deed? - What did you say? - You have coffee with cream and sugar, pastry from that baker down the street and three eggs and a steak on your... ...your fine china. I had oatmeal for breakfast with two glasses of milk, rationed. How many men... ...did I have to have sex with so you could have this? You stuff yourself like a pig and you dress up like royalty! A duchess? A duchess of what?! Men don't even pay to have sex with you anymore. You have to pay Magowan to have sex with you. You forget where I found you, missy. In an alley, covered with mud, broke and beaten bloody. I made you a princess. I can take it all away. I'm sorry. You're ungrateful. I don't know what I'm saying. I can't do this anymore. I have to get out of here. That teacup came around the Horn from England. I'll add the cost of it to your debt. My debt? Magowan will take you to your room so you can discuss further those thoughts you have banging around that pretty little head of yours. You will be as obedient as a street dog when I'm done with you! You have no idea how much I am gonna enjoy this. What's so funny? You. You're just... You're just one of Duchess's lapdogs. She rings a bell and you just come running. And she owns you, too. You're no different than all of us. You're just one of Duchess's... girls. Hmm. I'm gonna kill you. Do it. Do it! Murphy, get him a drink. - On the house. - Yes, ma'am. No one goes up the stairs without paying me first. Who did this to her? Magowan. I made him leave. Don't look at me like that. It's her fault. She pushed him too far. I'm taking her with me. She's not leaving until she pays me every penny she owes me. Okay, well... well, then... Fine. Good luck with her. Listen, I... I-I know the timing ain't perfect. But, uh... Will you marry me? Sure. - We'll get the preacher. - Yeah. He's down the street. Good morning. Looks like you... ...got me after all. Lucky you. Whatever Duchess had you pay, you got cheated. Well, you're beautiful, but that's not why I married you. I'm gonna work off my debt, and then I'm going back to get what's mine. Oh, uh... you can wear these. For now. Where's the wife that goes with this dress? Hope she isn't buried under the house. Oh, those belonged to my sister Tess. She, uh... She-she-she died last year. Her husband Paul, we, uh... ...we all came west together. How far away is Pair-A-Dice? A lifetime. In miles. About, uh, 20. 20 miles. Well, I hope you don't mind waiting a few days to... exercise your conjugal rights. Listen, uh, that... that's not why I brought you here. Mm-hmm. Well, you can take this back. Marriage is over. Where did you get a ring so fast? It, uh... ...belonged to my mother. Y-You gave me your mother's ring? Yeah. Okay. Whoa, hey. Oh. You know, shouldn't be up for longer than a few minutes at a time. - Now, what hurts most? - Nothing I want you touching. I'm not staying here for long. I'm not playing into your little marriage slave fantasy. Marriage is not slavery. Bad, bad dog. Go home. Shoo. Get! Go home! Go! Go home. Go get the stick. Go on. Ha! Ow. Leave me alone! I'm going back. You don't own me! You'll need water. It gets cold at night. That way is Pair-A-Dice. 19 more miles. Duchess and Magowan waiting for you at the end of the road. That way... is home. One mile downhill. Fire, food... ...and your husband. Your choice. Ha! Why are you doing this? One mile can be harder to walk than 20. Can you help me? I think it's time to pay you back. - Pl-Please don't. - Hmm? Can I ask you something? Yeah. I, uh... Does your God talk to you a lot? He talks to everyone. I mean... My mama prayed. She prayed, but God never heard her. 'Cause he doesn't care. So if you're telling me that your God said marry me, you know he's punishing you. 'Cause that's what he does. Grinds people into dust. Go on. Go on. Listen, um, this whole wife thing isn't for me, but I will play along until I pay you back what I owe you. Hmm. Well, we'll have to get your strength back. Then we'll have you out plowing the fields. You like eggs? Mm-hmm. Well, these ones belong to us. Go ahead, eat all you want. - Go on. - I... - Go on. - You... Hey. Hey, Mr. Chicken. Oh! I'll teach you how to cook roasted chicken, too. Uh, no, no. Right here. - Like that? - Just like that. Weeding is constant. We're getting rid of the bad and keeping the good. Mm, so subtle. Talk, talk, talk. Not too fast. All right, give me the axe. I-I don't think that's a good id... Give me the ax. Okay. - Wait. O-O-Okay, now. Steady yourself. - Shh. Sorry. Oh. Whoa. - Come on. - No, the wood is just too stiff. Come on, I'll help you. Oh, the wood? That's the problem? That's the problem? Come on, I'll help you up. - Look, it's still stuck. - That's true, that's true. Come on. Come on. There's room for two. I'm fine right here. I owe you. Come on. We're not ready. I don't understand you. I don't understand you either. Uh, uh, I think, uh, I think Maverick needs a walk. Uh, Maverick? Come on. What are you looking at? I'm gonna go saddle the horse in the barn. Okay. Did you think I couldn't find you? - You belong to me, Angel. - No! No! No! Angel, Angel! It's me. It's fine. It's me, okay? It's me. It's just... just a nightmare. You want to talk about it? No, I don't, I don't remember. Your heart's beating so fast, it's gonna come out your... Don't... touch me, please. Okay, come on. Get your boots on. We are going for a walk. It is the middle of the night. I'm not going anywhere with you. Well, you're going whether you want to or not. Now, you can go like that... or dressed. It's your choice. But you're going. Come on, Angel. What are you so afraid of? Nothing. Michael, where are you taking me? You'll see. This is ridiculous. I want to go back. We're almost there. Come on. Trust me. We're here. Look. That's the life I want to offer you, Angel. One full of color and warmth and beauty and light. Just give me a chance. If you knew half of what I did, you'd send me right back. Uh, listen, you did not choose the life you had. Okay? But you can choose the life you want. I chose to die. Well, you... do you still want to? No. - No, but... - But? I don't know why I'm here. Why... You say that I'm your wife, but you won't even... And it's... I don't blame you. I don't. I-I... I've just been waiting. Oh, Michael. Michael. Paul. - It's so good to see you. - Good to see you, too. I-I've missed you. I miss, I miss you, too. Look at you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, uh, so how was it out there? Uh, it-it was awful. Yeah. Yeah, it was a lot of hard work, uh, finding nothing and, uh... ...you know, drinking to forget. No gold, then, or...? No, no, no. No. Not enough to buy a pot to piss in at least, you know. Just... fighting for survival out there, mostly. What about you? - Uh... - You look, uh... Well, you always look content. I got married. You're married? That's right. Yeah. Well, uh, congr-gratulations, Michael. Thank you. Thank you. Well, am I gonna meet her? You... What's she like? Wh-Where is she? Angel? This is, uh... This is Paul. Paul, meet my wife, Angel. - Hello. - Hello. Um, uh... I'm sorry to gape at you, ma'am. Those are, um... Those are T-Tess's clothes, uh, the ones she made? - Uh, yeah, uh... - Mm-hmm. - Angel needed clothes. I... - Mm-hmm. I thought Tess would approve, so... Hmm. Well, you must be hungry. Three weeks on that trail? - Mm. Mm. - My God. That was just on foot. Yeah, it was about seven total. Brutal. Come on outside. I'll show you what I did to the barn since you left - to make your fortune. - All right. Mm. I'm-a get a refill. Sure. I'll be right there. Okay. So Michael doesn't know what you are, does he? - Should I remember you? - Mm. Well, I suppose all faces start to look alike, someone in your business, huh? Yeah, and everything else, too. Yeah, seeing you in my wife's clothes makes me sick to my stomach. - I'd like to rip 'em off you. - I bet you would. Michael is the best man that I know, and he deserves a decent girl, not... ...you. Wh-What'd you do to get your claws into him, huh? Well, Michael came to the Palace, he paid for my time, and then he begged me to marry him. That's a lie. I know Michael, and Michael would never step foot inside of a whorehouse. Well, the whore is here now. So I guess you're just gonna have to deal with that. Oh, no, I don't. Look at the new hayloft. Yeah. Come on, give me a hand with this. I-I-I need to talk to you about something, Michael. It's about Angel. Sh-She's not who you think she is. She's exactly who I think she is. She's my wife. Michael, before she was your wife... ...she was the highest priced whore in Pair-A-Dice. I know all about that. Y-You know? - Yes. - Michael, listen to me. She has been with thousands of men. She just does not love you. She is using you. You have no idea who she is. Well, maybe you should look at your own life - instead of judging hers. - Well, what do you think your mother'd say about marrying a piece of trash - like that? - Yeah. "Trash." If you love me like a brother, then you will love her as well. Understand? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh... I mean, Tess was my sister. Okay? You're not, you're not the only one suffering. I'm sorry. Come on. Come on. You need supplies. Okay, go to Pair-A-Dice. Uh, I'll give you enough money to get what you need. You can, you can borrow Shadrach and the wagon. And buy another horse while you're there. Listen, the town has a preacher. Go to church. Try to remember the man you were... ...when you married my sister. Paul needs to sort things out. He's coming over tomorrow for the horse and wagon to go into town. He was mad because I didn't remember him. The truth is I don't know. Every man looks the same without clothes on. You're not that person anymore. I'll always be that person. I don't care what you've done. See, I... I just want to build a life with you. I want to have children with you. - Michael... - A new beginning. Hmm? A family. I taught you how to be careful, so this wouldn't happen. Dr. Smith's gonna take care of the problem. So it never happens again. No! No! No! Please don't take... Please don't take... Please, my baby! My baby! No! I told you what would happen if you disobeyed me. Please. Please! Wait! Wait. - Wait, wait. - Whoa. What do you want? I want a ride. Yeah, 'cause you're running off on him, aren't you? Oh, you want me to stay? Well, come on. Gonna take us all day to get to town. You, uh... you want a drink? - Yeah. - Hold on, now. You got to say "please" if you want one. Please. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Tell me something. How'd you really meet Michael? Hmm? - I already told you how all of this came about. - Liar. Michael didn't go into any brothel. There's no need to be jealous. Now that I'm gone, you can have Michael all to yourself. You owe me for the ride. What exactly did you have in mind? You know, I never did make it upstairs to the Palace. But I have always wondered what it might be like to make it inside Angel's... ...inner sanctum. And now you want to know. Mm-hmm. Maybe I do. Well... might as well do it now or we'd... ...never get there before dark. What'd you have in mind? Whatever you want, mister. Long as I can get a ride. Or was that all a bluff? Let's go! Come on. Come on. Whoa. Whoa. Go on. Get down. I don't want to be seen with you. You know, I never pretended to be anything but what I am. But you? You took Michael's money, you took his... his wagon... his horse, and then you took his wife. Call yourself his brother. Walk on. It burned down, Angel. When? About five weeks back. Last real excitement we've had in this town. It's good to see you, Angel. Assuming that marriage thing didn't work out. Where's Duchess? I came back to get what she owes me. She didn't even have a thimble to spit in. Magowan burned the whole thing down around her. We caught up with him, hung him. Two of the girls died in the fire. Which ones? Mai Ling. Little Chinese flower. I liked her. And the other? Loudmouth drunk. What was her name? - Lucky. - Yeah, that's her. They were trapped upstairs. Screaming. Awful way to die. Come see my place. Whiskey's fine. Got a spare room upstairs. You could be back in business in five minutes. Just say the word. All we got to do is figure out the cut. What do you say, Angel? Fifty-fifty. They pay me, I pay you. Mm. Fair enough. Providing you give me what I want whenever I want it, and it's free. Hey, whoa. Whoa there. I stopped by my place, you know, un-unload the supplies is why it took me so long. You took her back. She asked me to, Michael. I... I-I tried to, I tried to warn you. I'm-I'm sorry. Go home, Paul. Now. Before I kill you with my bare hands. All right, come on. Hey. Hey! Hey, where you think you're going?! ...your eyes like that, I don't know any... Get out! Do you want to stay here? Come on. Come on. - She stays here! - Yeah. Stay there. Jesus! Let's go. Did Paul tell you about what we did? He didn't have to. The guilt was written all over his face. Then why did you come for me? - Why didn't you just leave me where I belong? - Because... I love you. Stop. Angel, stop. - I'm not clean. - Angel, hey. Don't-don't touch me. I'm not... - Hey, hey, stop, stop. - I'm not clean. Let 'em go. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Come on. - I'm not clean, Michael. Hey, hey. Hey. Look at me, okay? I forgive you. I forgive you. Come on. You have to stop thinking that I'm gonna be something that I'm not. I don't know how to love. I've got too many demons. My father was my demon. He was a plantation owner. Slaves. I told him when he died, I'd free them all. So he beat me bloody... ...dragged me down to the slaves' quarters. Said I should see how animals live since I loved them so much. Ezra... ...an old slave, took care of me, and, uh... ...mm, taught me about God. And forgiveness. So I took Ezra down to the bayou and, uh... set him free. What about your father? What did he do? He wanted me to learn the benefits of ownership, so he sent a young slave girl to my room. Told me she was there for me to, uh... ...to do with what I pleased. I packed up and left that night. - Never looked back. - And the girl? Did... did you? No, I did not. See, sometimes you have to leave behind what you were born into to become who... ...who God meant you to be. Been thinking about planting fruit trees. Over there. What about walnuts? Mm. Good idea. Fruit all summer, nuts in the fall. I got a fish! Ah! I got a fish! Whoa now. Whoa now. Whoa now. Damn wheel. Need some help? That'd be mighty kind of you, sir. - What'd you hit? - Hi. Can you please help us? My mom's in so much pain. When is the baby due? About this time last week. She's not doing well. Where you looking to settle? - I really like Oregon. - Oregon? We have the best farmland west of the Rockies right here. - I have 300 acres. - Let's go give this to your ma. And Paul's got just as much, and-and there's more available land next to him. - Thank you. - See, the thing about the California soil... Thank you so much for your kindness. We've been living in that wagon for over a year. I'd forgotten what it feels like to be in a real bed. I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come along. Mama wasn't doing well. This baby can't stay in the womb much longer. Hey, uh, hold on. I got it. - Attach it down there. - Okay. Just connect it down there. Michael, do you have... How did you and Michael come to California? Oh, he came by land, and I came by ship. How did you two meet? He rescued me from a brothel in Pair-A-Dice. Oh, you mean it. I'm-I'm sorry. Mama always says I shouldn't pry, but I just want to know you better. I like you. You like me? Yes. Can you forgive me? I want us to be friends. Why do you want to be my friend?

With Michael's help, I bought the land just east of Paul's, and he's rounded up a few men, and we'll have a cabin up in a few weeks. Thank heavens. If you'd put me back on that wagon, I'd have shot ya. - We're staying. - Congratulations. Michael. Yeah. Welcome to the neighborhood, partner. Thank you. - It's right over yonder. - It is. I'm, uh, I'm glad you came, Paul. Mm-hmm. Miriam is... she's a beautiful girl. Mm, she is. And you two have a lot in common. You get along so well. You jealous of her? No, that's not it. You have no reason to be jealous. I'm not jealous. She can just give you more than I can offer you. I want you. No one else. Well, you want children. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. I can't have children. You can't know that. I got pregnant once. And Duke, um, he had a doctor, and he said that he would make sure that it would never happen again. Michael! I need help! The sheep are loose! Listen to me. I love you. Nothing's gonna change that. Nothing is impossible. What are we celebrating? - Us. - Hmm? Dinner first. That was delicious. Mmm. Let's go to the hilltop where you first showed me the sunrise. You know, I never paid attention to sunrises and sunsets... ...till you brought me here. What's gotten into you? Just want you to have a good night. I love you. Excuse me. Mister? Hey. - Uh, can I get... - Yep. Are you going into town? Mm-hmm. Get in. There you go. Hyah. Hyah. Wh-Where's Angel? Gone. Sh-She, um... she left this for me. You have to go after her. She has free will. It has to be her choice. Mister? I think you need a better cook. We hired one, but he left for the goldfields. Well, hire me. I can bake pies and bread and biscuits. You can call it "Mama's Home Cooking." Name's Virgil Harper. Mama's Home Cooking. You got yourself a job, missy. Well, I need a place to stay. You can have the cook's quarters. It's right off the kitchen. There's a good lock on the door. You're gonna work yourself to death. Keeps me from thinking too much. Paul says Angel's probably in Sacramento or San Francisco. What else did Paul say? Just go after her, Michael. Bring her back where she belongs. You want to help? Pray for her. That's what I'm doing. - Are you doing all right? - Oh, yes, ma'am. All right. So this is yours. - Pass it down! - Got it. - Hurry! - Here, here. - Hurry up! Let's go! - Hurry! Come on, bring up the next one! Let's go! - Hurry up! - Keep it coming! There you go! - Come on! - Keep it moving! Jesus, let me go after her. Let me, Lord, please. Or just give me the strength to hold tight. Hello, Angel. It's been a long, long time. It's fate that I find you only a couple of blocks from my front door. Did you come to... all the way to California just to find me? Well, circumstances changed in Boston, but then there are fortunes to be made here and few laws on how it's done. Shall we go? All that I have to do is scream, and a dozen men will come help a lady in distress. Open your mouth, and I'll have Colin kill Virgil Harper some dark foggy night. You... ...a cook? Ah, it's a pity the café burned down. Leave us, Rosie. Take the key. Lock her in the room next door. - Come on. Let's go. Let's go. - No. How old is she, Duke? I need you to get cleaned up. You're going onstage tonight. I need to put my best prostitute on display. How old is she? Eight? Nine? You jealous, Angel? You never could handle a woman, could you? What's happened to you, dear? What's it gonna take to bring my little Angel back? Fill the bathtub up with warm water. Don't push me, Angel. As fond as I am of you, you're not indispensable. If she gets away again, I'll hold you accountable. I'll be next door with the girls. - Come here! - No! Get over here! I said now! Get over here! Come here! Please stop now! Please! Please. God! My God. God, I want to believe. I do. If you're real, please just help me. If you want revenge for everything I've ever done, then so be it, but those girls need you. I need you. Help me. Please. Wake up. I want to believe. Sarah. Tell them the truth, darling. I give you an Angel. Feel the power, Angel. We can share it. We'll bring them to their knees. Duke fancies little girls. - What? - What? He has two locked away upstairs right now. He abuses us until we do anything to survive. I was eight years old when he bought me. I escaped when I was 17, but he found me and he forced me here. Lies! All lies. A scorned woman tells lies, gentlemen. Lies! And you're the father of lies. Get over here! Let-Let's dance. Let's dance. Let's dance. All right. I should've killed you when I had the chance. Goodbye, Angel. Stay down. Go. Get out of here. Go. - Colin! - Go. That's enough. Colin! Quiet. Don't you dare. Okay, I'm-I'm gonna get you girls out of here. Colin! Coming! Come on. There are little girls in here! Hang Duke! Hang Duke! Godspeed. There he is! Oh, well, she-she definitely did. I'll see you. ...30, we got 2.648, divided by 22, multiplied by 60. Don't forget the... Ma'am. Can I help you, sir? I'm looking for a girl. I bet you are. Uh, she went by the name Angel. Uh, I think I saw her come in here yesterday. Paul. Wh-What is this place? It is a shelter and a school. For women like me who want a new life. Do you, um... ever go back to the valley? Miriam told me you wanted to go back to the goldfields. She talked me out of it. How is she? Well... ...she's in a family way. Wow. That's... Well, that is... that's wonderful news. Well... guess you're gonna have to help him build an addition to the cabin. He'll need it. What for? For the baby. He and Miriam definitely need more room. Miriam is my wife. Not Michael's. He's still waiting for you. What? Why would you do that? Why would you get in the way? - Miriam is perfect for him. - I didn't. She's-she's innocent. She's pure. She's intelligent. She knows how to love. - She chose me. - She loved him. Like a brother, she loved him. You need to go back and you need to tell him that you found out I was dead. Do you hear me? Cholera, consumption, anything. Michael has to find a nice girl that can give him children, Paul. I can't. Did... - Did he know? - Yes. I told him. So that's why you left? You thought he would... he would go to Miriam, and they... I was wrong about you, Angel. 'Cause I hated you. But what you-you said to me that day outside Pair-A-Dice, I... I knew you were right about me. I'm a scoundrel and I betrayed my brother and... Angel? Angel, will you... will you forgive me? I forgave you a long time ago, Paul. How could I not... ...with all the forgiveness that I've been given? Uh... Come back with me. Michael is suffering. This has already been hard enough. I'm needed here. The carriage leaves my hotel at 4:00. Please come with me. He loves you. What are you thinking about? I've missed you so much. I missed you both. Did you find her? Go on. My real name is Sarah. And I've never told anyone that. Until now. Because it was the only thing that I had that no one could take from me. I came here to tell you that I love you. And I am so sorry. I'm so sorry for all of the pain that I've caused you, Michael. It's your pain that brought us to this moment. Keep it on this time, will you, please? I'll never take it off. As long as I live. Welcome home, Sarah. I've always loved you. Welcome home. Come. Come on, baby. Yeah. Right here. Okay, come. Do you want to fish? Ready? Ready? Oh, oh. Good! Yeah! Here. Come here. Okay. Okay. Go that way.
