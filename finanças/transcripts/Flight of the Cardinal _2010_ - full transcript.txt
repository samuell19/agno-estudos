(upbeat music) (laughing) - [Man] Still got it. (intense music) (dog barking) - No, no, no. Stay there, pup. You couldn't keep up with me today. (eerie music) (dramatic music) Morning. Nice day, isn't it? - Out of work actor. (mumbling) (light guitar music) (dark eerie music) That's the stuff. (clattering) - I'm planning on running myself later. - Sorry, I didn't think you'd be up so early. I'll start breakfast. - I can't sleep late even on vacation. I have this, like, ingrained sense that there's something someone forgot to do. - Well, I'll put a pot of coffee on. - Oh, I already had coffee, that's very nice. I should be leaving soon anyway. I have a lunch date in Knoxville at noon. He is six-foot and a realtor and he has a Cocker Spaniel. We met on the internet. His picture is very handsome. You're about six-foot. - Yeah. Gonna need to give yourself about two hours to get through the Tail of the Dragon. - Alright. - Sunny side up? - Mm. - Alright. - [Voice Machine] You have no new messages. ♫ A fly stuck on the wall, wall ♫ Down the hall - Damn, forgot the cumin. ♫ The throwing the pillow and all of the mess ♫ It’s not my best, but I swear I can do better ♫ Itchy-gitchy ya-ya-ya ♫ Gonna get in the car, car ♫ Gonna make ya proud, proud ♫ Just to be around a superstar - [Man] Goddamn! ♫ I put down the top, I drive the car ♫ To the left, to the right, stand up - Food's up! - I'll be right in. - Hey, you getting a connection? - Well, I do today. It's a good thing, 'cause I can approve these invoices. People want to get paid, imagine that. - Well, your breakfast is on the table. I'll be up in the cabin, just give me a buzz on the intercom if you need anything. - Ooh ah lamb. (man chuckling) (light music) (pills rattling) (phone ringing) - Blue Waters, good morning. - [Man] Hey baby, how's Appalachia? - Andy. God, I have been trying to reach for you three days. You're still coming, right? - [Andy] Yeah, I'm headed to my Atlanta flight, plane gets in at two, should be there by four. - Yeah, maybe five. Hey, um, how long can you stay? - [Boy] Hey, you were a stray once, too, weren't you, boy? - [Man] People in these parts shoot first and ask questions later. - You look more like you're going to a beauty shop than the shooting range. Besides, bet you don't even know how to use that gun you keep tucked away. Here, try this. Oh no, not for you. Good, huh? Recreational materials. A little hair color. Who are you trying to impress, what's her name? - Oh, no I've got friends visiting this weekend. - You need a pipe? Just another twenty. Thought you said you landed here on the run, and I was your only friend. - Is friendship what we're calling it now? - Yes, sir. Now I got me friends in high places. - My state of mind, not state of being. - Nah, you're the man. I'd kill for this life you got here, Grady Wilson. I can't even scrape together enough to get my bike out the shop. - Hope this helps. - It will, I guess. I'd sure appreciate it if you got some work I could do around here. - Business is bad, Beetle. Your mom toss you out again? - Something like that. Occupational hazard, I guess. You know, I'd do anything else if I could. A lot I could do if someone would just give me a chance. But I'd be real good at the hotel business. I'll work real cheap like before. (eerie music) - Okay, do rooms five and nine. Vacuum, dust, sweep the front porch and the lobby, pay you for half a day. - Whole weekend and a bed to sleep in. - What, you're negotiating? - Maybe a little. Whole day's pay plus a bed, and I'm yours for the weekend. - Plus look after the kitchen for a little? - I ain't so good at dishes. - (chuckles) You'll learn. Half day, room and board, out on Monday. (Grady whistles) (dark mystery music) (light guitar music) - Excuse me. I thought you checked out already. - Who are you? - I'm Beetle. I'm just helping out today. - That's nice. - Male cardinal's got hellfire's belly, I tell ya. Hangs around birds, all kinds of other birds. And for some reason he never let's another of his own kind nest anywhere near. See this one male cardinal chasing the other tree to tree? That shrill sound is anger. Pure fury on account that he was here first. Look at him drowning out the other, yeah. Hollerin' and chasin' and chasin' and hollerin'. Now when he wins, and he will, on account of he won't stop 'til he does, he'll return to this here favorite tree, his feathers all puffed up, and they'll sing him a victory song. - What will he have won? - A place of his own for a while, I guess. - Alone? How do you know so much about birds? - Grandfather told me some stuff once. I guess it kinda stuck. Hey, you can spare me some money, right? I gotta get my bike from the mechanic, I'm still, like, 200 short. - You want money from me? - Yes, ma'am. I do. (dark eerie music) (engine revving) (dark mystery music) - [Man] We're going every conceivable direction at once. How is this possible? - You know Sophie would be perfect for the part. You're not alone in loving her, there's a lot of interest, but your back-end points are insulting, and I'm gonna need to see another zero on that base. Listen, Bear, why don't you just think about it overnight, okay? I know you're trying to catch a plan to Mer, Bear? I lost him. Hey, the road splits ahead, what do I do? - Arrive here. - What? That doesn't make any sense. I just, this visiting Grady. - Grady's doing fine. - Then I don't know if I have it in me to do this all over again. I swear, sometimes I feel like we should just cut our losses and run. (rhythmic music) - Grady. - What? - You got a little problem here. The john in nine is clogged and overflowin'. - Did you try a plunger? - I tried everything I could think. - Jesus Christ. - That's a nice reaction. You know Arlis, right? - No. - He's my bud, I'll call him for you. - Is he a plumber? - Yeah, he's a plumber. Best in town. Probably the whole county. - Oh God, I still need to run and get eggs, Rye and Karen are gonna be here at any minute. - Go ahead, I'll call him for you. I'll hook you up. I got your back. - I sure am sorry to hear about your mom, Beetle. - [Beetle] Thanks, Arlis. (toilet gurgling) - Got it. - What's that? - Looks like a pair of panties. Ladies' pink panties. - How you suppose that got down there? - Well, you won't believe the kind of things I find in people's pipes. Once found a cat. (register whirring) - Just put it on my account, my name's Grady Wilson. - I know who you are, Mr. Wilson. - Oh. I get a little carried away in my head, I've got a lot going on, and I forget to be courteous, I'm sorry. - It's okay, just 'cause you see some smoke doesn't mean that there's a fire. - Excuse me? - We take things in stride in these parts, Mr. Wilson, you'll catch on. - Yes. Have a good day. - [Arlis] I'm used to getting paid when I finish a job, you know? - Oh, I know, but he ain't here. I don't know where he's at. I'll ask Grady to drop off your pay as soon as I see him. You know, with all these rooms, he's like to need a plumber more often. You want us to hook you up? - What exactly you got in mind, son? - Just saying, you scratch my back I'll scratch yours. - What are we talking about here, a twice-a-year snake job? - Every other week, snakes and more. At least as long as I'm here. I can't get by on what folks like Grady Wilson will pay. I imagine it's tough on you, too. I'm just saying, look around. He's doing just fine. It's you and me who's getting the short end, if you know what I mean. - That's my beer money for the weekend. You best make it worth my while. - You have my word, Arlis. Hey, you're adding that into your cost, ain't ya? (dark mystery music) - I want a different birth sign. - You mean like astrology? - Yeah, I just don't get along with other Sagittariuses. They're too fussy and focused on one thing at a time. And they take themselves way too seriously. - [Rye] Who else is a Sagittarius? - [Karen] Grady. - [Rye] I mean, like anyone famous? - [Karen] Oh, um, Jim Morrison. Jane Austin. - I don't know that I would necessarily want those two together. What would you be? Gemini? - [Karen] No, they're too passive. - I'm not passive. (eerie music) (footsteps clattering) - Oh my God. This is gorgeous! A big improvement. - [Rye] Grady! There he is. Nice to see you, man. - Thank you for coming. You have no idea how much I've missed you. - It's good to see you smiling. - I've got an amazing dinner planned for tonight and a surprise guest. - Oh, I've missed your cooking. - [Rye] Who's the surprise guest? - It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you. - [Rye] Come on, Grady, you know can't keep a secret, man. - It's Andy. - What? - Andy's coming! - [Rye] When? - Like now! It's gonna be the four of us together again just like old times. - I need to use the bathroom, oh! Hello. - Good afternoon. I'm Beetle. Room nine, right? - That's Beetle. - Beetle, I'm Rye, this is my wife, Karen. - Pleasure. I'm gonna get these things to your room. And I'll fix something to drink. - [Rye] Oh, you're the man, Beetle. Cold beer when you get a chance. - Ah, no, I'll get that. - This room's my personal favorite. It's got the best view of the lake. And a jacuzzi hot tub with jets. - Oh, nah, I can't take money from you. - Yes, you can. - Think of this as your home. Just let me know if you need anything, ma'am. - Ma'am? Please, I'm not that old. - No disrespect intended. I call every young lady over 20 ma'am. You are over 20? - Pile it on, kid. You know, with your Southern charm and those looks, I bet you're quite a handful. (dark eerie music) (relaxing music) - [Rye] Blue Waters Scrabble Championship. - I think most of them awards are from the previous owners. - Everybody come in here and walk away with something? - Pretty much, I guess. - What about you? - Not yet. - You and Grady close? - Yes, sir, I like to think so. - Is he doing okay here? Is he happy? - He gets by about the best he can, I suppose. - Is he making any friends in town? - Suspect it takes a local some time to warm up depending on how a new person presents himself and all. - I worry about him. I imagine it's pretty lonely here in the winter. - Indeed, it is. Sounds like you're good buds. - Yeah, you know, good times and bad. - Grady has some bad times, has he? If I may be so bold, did something bad happen to Grady? I've often suspected that maybe what drove him out-- - Hey. Let's just say we all went through a bit of recovery period, alright? Leave it at that. (dark eerie music) - This carrot will perhaps just thwart off my pending buzz. (chuckling) I wasn't so sure that you and Andy were on good terms these days. - No, no, no, no, we're good. - Says you or says he? - Well, both of us, I hope. I'm gonna ask him to move in. I want us to be married. (chuckles) In sentiment if not in law. It is North Carolina after all. Oh, I want you to see this. - Aw, Grady. - Perhaps the feelings that we experienced when we were in love represent a normal state. - [Karen] Being in love shows a person who he should be. - You remember your Russian lit. - Of course I do. Mr. Kitrich was hot. - Mm yeah, he was. (chuckling) - It's really nice. I just hope that Andy can see the person he should be. Why is it that all the men in my life have a problem facing reality? - Did you say something? - Beetle. A chef requires more wine, and I need another martini. Very dry. - That's number two. - I can count, don't worry. - Wouldn't worry. Bet mama don't burn the grits. - Oh, I love the regional vernacular. Oh, I sound condescending, I don't mean to be, it's just that I have this fascination for colloquialisms. You from around here? - Born and raised less than two miles away. - [Karen] I bet you're close with your family. - Sometimes a little closer in proximity than I'd like, I suppose. - I bet it's a big family, and your dad is the kind, dedicated type who would work a second job? - Actually, Ms. Karen, my pop's dead. Or so I'm told. No other kids, just me. - Beetle. Don't mind Karen over here. She's sure she has a keen ability to sum up all the little bits and pieces of stranger's lives. - Alright then. Try me. Try again. - Your mom, she was the independent type. She had to shelve a few big dreams to focus on the materiality of raising a son on her own. - Actually, mom's got the bipolar. Sweet as pie one second, raising the steeple the next. She had a waitress job once. Got so worked up on a customer, she threw a pot of scowlin' coffee at him. They let her go. - Alright, you have a girlfriend. - It's not working out so good this week, actually. - You went to high school. - K through 12. Yes, ma'am. - You did well? - Mostly. Feels a little like the law's coming down on me. Did I pass? - You did, I did horribly, though. - Yeah, she's usually much, much better. - No, there is something. There's a certain quality about you. You know who you remind me of? A younger version of Rye. Doesn't he have a similar persona? - No. Rumor has it you require more wine. - No, rumor has it you require sweet buds. - Grady, you're a good man. - [Grady] Mm-hmm. - What ya cookin'? - Glazed carrots, a little bit of orange zest, a little bit of agave, it's gonna be real good. Mm-hmm, you hungry? - Yes, sir. - Come on, don't take one! - You reading Oscar Wilde? - [Beetle] Trying to. - It's one of my favorites. - Yeah? Maybe you can help me then. I have a little trouble understanding this right here. - [Karen] Read it to me. - Alright. "It is better not to be different from one's fellows, "the ugly and the stupid "have the best of it in this world. "For if they know nothing of victory, "they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. "Shall all suffer terribly "for what the gods have given us?" - I think you understand that just fine. - Anyway. What about you, Ms. Karen? - What about me, Mr. Beetle? I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific with your question. - Well, tell me about your job. - [Karen] What do you think I do? - Alright, I get it. God, I won't be much good at this game, though. You work behind the scenes in the entertainment industry. - Yes. I am a talent agent. - And I bet you got a lot of fancy university degrees. You go to school for something like that. - Not a prerequisite. But this one did with a master's in political science. - But it takes a lot more than education or hard work to get where you're at. - Yes, dear Beetle, I scratched and clawed my way through the assistant's pool and I waited. - And what do we wait for? - We waited for someone to die or have a breakdown or screw up and get fired. All the above. Anything for an opportunity. To win big somebody else has got to lose big. (mysterious music) - Karen. - Hi, Andy. - Wow. What a great surprise, I didn't know I was gonna get to see you this weekend. Funny, I was just thinking about you, meaning to call, how's Rye? - Rye's in the kitchen with Grady. You can go ask him yourself. - Hello. I'm Andy. - Something from the bar for you, sir? - Sir. Jack on the rocks if you got it stocked. - We're so stocked back here, it's fixin' to fall a flood. - This is Beetle. He's the newest member of the Blue Water staff. Not only does he have the ear and intuition of a great bartender, he is, in my opinion, the keystone for the future success of our little venture. - Hm. Well, awesome. What kind of a name is Beetle anyway? - Just my nickname as a kid. Guess it kinda stuck. - Yes, I guess it did. - Beetle. So help me out. Where the hell can I get cell phone reception? - Your best bet's probably out front of the lodge, on the road above the deck. - Cool. Thanks. Well, I better run and say my hellos. - What you mean "our venture?" Are you an investor here or something? - Does anything get by you? - I hope not. - Yes, I am a silent investor, we all are. But let's just keep it silent, okay? - Mom's the word. - Grady! Hi! I, um... I didn't know you and Karen were gonna be here, Rye. - Surprises abound. I guess I could say the same for you. - Listen, I have to make a call. Work. - Yeah. Remember to try out front by the lake. - I know. Beetle told me. He's got me covered. - Beetle's got Andy covered. - Beetle's got a lot of things covered. - I actually feel sorry for him. (door creaks) - Mm. What has Grady told you about us? - Well, nothing, but I guess he cares about you, just 'cause he's got to impress. - Why do you say that? - Well, he's been exercising like a crazy man. And well, yeah, I can't tell you. - Well, you started, now you have to finish. - Well, he even dyed the gray out of his hair this morning. - Really? Grady's gone gray. - What? - Oh, nothing. No, it looks good. - Beetle. Go stir the carrots. - Let's go shoot some pool. (dark eerie music) (sizzling) - Hey baby, it's me. Sorry I missed you. Cell phone reception sucks here. I'm standing in the middle of a road in front of a lake below a mountain, it's like the only place my phone will work. (chuckles) Crazy, huh? Listen, I should probably stay over and catch a morning plane. I know that's not what we talked about, but I'll be out of here tomorrow, I love you. (calm guitar music) - Phone work? - Yeah, thanks. You know... You look so good. And this place is-- - Thanks. - Is that tapestry new? - Yeah. - What's with you? - Nothing. Why? - It's not nothing, what is it? - Let's talk later. - Later? - Yeah, when it's just you and me. - You're seeing somebody else, aren't you? You didn't come here to visit, you came here to break up. That's what you've been, that's why you've been avoiding my calls. - I'm a horrible person. Please understand that I, I don't want to hurt you. - You can't do this to me now. I'm so alone here, I need you. - Baby, baby, baby, I hear you. Grady, I hear you, I do. But it doesn't work for you in the city, and I can't live out here. I love you, but what do you, what do you expect me to do, Grady? (slow dramatic music) - Andy. (grunts) I know you have some trouble controlling your impulses, but how could you not even tell him that you're seeing somebody? Grady's fragile. - Oh, come on. He's not gonna break. I wanted to see him in person and talk face to face in private. - But you put me in a really awkward position. - Uh! I didn't intend to do anything to you, I didn't even know you were gonna be here! What, you want me to just go, I will. - You'll do what you need to. You always do. (balls click) - Karen, seriously, you are one of the most intelligent, beautiful women I know. It kills me to see you this angry. - Don't even, Andy. Your bullshit is completely transparent, and I don't trust you. - Oh, don't start in on trust with me, 'cause if it weren't for your, uh, deceit, none of Grady's mess would've gone down. - [Karen] That's a low blow. - [Rye] Is something burning? - [Andy] Manny Knowles, Karen. You destroyed Grady. - [Karen] Fuck you, Andy. - [Andy] Own your guilt, Karen! - [Karen] Show some responsibility. - [Andy] What do you think I'm doing? - [Karen] I don't know, when you left, you went to New York, Grady's out here. - [Rye] Serious, something's burning! - [Karen] You totally deserted him! - [Andy] What are you doing here? - [Karen] I don't know what I'm doing here-- - [Andy] Exactly! - Everything alright around here? - There's smoke. - [Karen] You're making a mess out of everything! - [Andy] It wouldn't have been a mess if you wouldn't have been here. (confused chatter) (mysterious music) (alarm blaring) Shoot. - [Rye] Grady! - [Andy] Disconnect it from the box! The box! - What happened? My lamb vindaloo! - Which food do you mean, charred beyond recognition? - That noise. Can someone turn that off? (alarm stops) - Mama don't burn the grits, but papa's got issues. - Got them set about 500 degrees, who did this? It's ruined! Why can't I do anything right? (Rye coughing) (rhythmic music) - This orange-colored rice is really, really good. (eerie music) (utensil clinks) - Sweetheart, are you okay? - No. No, not really. I don't know what's going on. You know, I'm glad you're all here, but I'm not feeling very well, so I'm gonna turn in. (knocking on door) Come in, Beetle. - It's chicken soup. I found it in your deep freeze. You made it, so it must be good. - [Grady] I'm not hungry. - You didn't eat dinner. I thought you might could drink a cup of soup. What ya doing? - [Grady] Watching. - Watching what? - [Grady] Everything. - Well, I hope you feel real better soon. - [Grady] Thank you. (eerie music intensifies) - Took him some soup, don't know if he's gonna eat, but I tried. - What's he doing? - Watching us. - Watching us? - On the surveillance monitors. - You like working here? - Happy to have a job, especially these days. Guess you know what I mean. I bet Ms. Tammy and the others wish they hadn't have quit. - Who's Ms. Tammy? - Oh, she was the last housekeeper. - Why'd she quit? - Suspect she didn't like him watching her all the time. He'd holler down at her over the intercom if something wasn't dusted or moved wrong or worse. - You know Grady, he's particular about things. I guess that's what makes him good at his job. (dishes clanging) You do think Grady's good at his job, right? - I suppose. Hey Rye, wait. I'd really like it if we could be friends. I know you probably think I'm just some silly small-town kid. But I got a lot to offer, I just don't get a chance to show it much. All I want's a chance, you know? A job and maybe a new friend with a different perspective. - Sure, Beetle. I don't see why we can't be friends. - [TV Announcer] You're gonna need to do more than a cleaning with this old girl. Not if you want to keep your house. She gets fire in it more than your fireplace can. (Karen groaning) You can salvage lumber from your historic home, tailor-made to fit in your room. - Can you, I'm watching that. - You're watching a home show on fireplace restoration. - I was listening to it. - I didn't know you were awake. - I don't have my sleeping pills. I forgot to pack them. You shouldn't eat after 10. - I was talking with Beetle. - In the kitchen with a sandwich? He's a nice guy. - We kind of have similar personas, don't you think? - Please, he's a child. And I like men. Well, one man. What's wrong? - Beetle claims all the employees here have quit. He says Grady sits upstairs all day watching the surveillance monitor. And every time the employees do something wrong he comes down and yells at them. - Grady wouldn't sit around watching a surveillance monitor. Would he? - I don't know. But this cable package kind of stinks. - I just hope he doesn't hit us up for more cash. This place could become a money pit, I mean more than what it really already is. You know, I already put 60.000 into this place? We can't just let him run it into the ground, now, can we? You know, I had to take a loss in the first two, and we could deduct 100% of investment. - That's good then, right? - Yeah, well it could be. - Did you tell Beetle I was out of work? - [Karen] No, I wouldn't do that. Why do you ask? - Something he said implied that he knew. - He's very intuitive. - That borders on psychic behavior. - Maybe Grady said something. - Yeah, must be it. He needs to keep that mouth shut. And mind his own freaking business. (Rye groans) - [TV Announcer] See if we can't find a new mantle. - Night. - [TV Announcer] Removing stains and clean up this whole marble kit, clean up the-- (loud thud) (yawns) - Excuse me. Excuse me. No towels in room five. - [Andy] Sorry. - You're fine. Night now. - Night! (light music) (mysterious music) (floor creaking) - [Beetle] What's the matter, can't sleep? - What? (chuckling) - So you can't sleep either? - No, I was just going to the kitchen for a snack. - Want to smoke a joint? You ever think Grady could get like he was before? - What do you mean? - You know, the incident. - You know about that? - Yes, I do. - Well, he's made a lot of progress since his attempted suicide, and he's been taken care of by some really great doctors. Don't worry, I'm sure he'll be okay. - So you were good to stand by him as long as you did. I'd imagine that paranoia and depression must take its toll on a friendship. - I managed. Call me Andy. - I should really get some sleep, Andy. - Yeah, me too. (gentle guitar music) - [Grady] Morning. - Now I know you have another choice, there's always another choice, but Sophie is your first choice. No, no, no, we got to come to terms on this. No, meet me more than halfway. Let's get this deal out of the sand trap and onto the putting green. Alright, send me an offer. Alright, you're a doll. - Got a big one comin'. - It's fixin' to fall a flood? - Yes, ma'am. - Come sit with me, Beetle. - Nah, I shouldn't. - Have you eaten? Catch yourself a plate and sit. So do you like working here, Beetle? - Yes, ma'am, I do. - Apart from the occasional ones it gets overly familiar, I suppose. But I love it here, this is a beautiful place. And I'm happy just keeping sure guests are attended to. - And what to do the customers and people in town think of Grady? - It's not really for me to say. I don't gossip. - I respect that, but it's not gossip. I'm his friend. - From what I know, it's friends who gossips most of all. - You might be right. Regardless, I would like you to be candid with me. - Well, I don't know how things work in the big city. But around here, a man's reputation is everything. - And how is Grady's reputation? - Look around, there's nobody here. Not the best, I suppose. (door rattles) - Good morning. - Every day I see this same woman, and every day she ignores me. Why does that power walking freak hate me? - Maybe because you call her a power walking freak. - Not to her face. - How ya feeling? - About the same. - Excuse me, Ms. Karen. I better go see if there's anything he needs me to do. (rhythmic music) - I absolutely cannot focus today. - Ms. Karen asked me to sit with her. I told her I shouldn't, but she insisted. - Oh, that's fine. Is anybody else up? - Not yet. I don't suppose we'll be seeing Andy for quite some time. I guess he got real friendly with Mr. Daniels last night. I don't understand it, but if a man wants to lie with another man, I suppose it's none of my business. 'Til it becomes business. What I mean to say is, I ain't comfortable receiving sexual advances at my place of work. - What? What? What? (suspenseful music) Andy! Andy! (bangs on door) Get the hell up right now! - [Andy] Jesus, would you keep your voice down, what is it? - [Grady] You are such a pig. - [Andy] What!? - [Grady] How could you do that? He is an employee, he's a kid! - [Andy] Oh, that? Jesus, nothing happened. - [Grady] You put your hand on my employee's cock against his will. - [Andy] Against? - [Grady] You are getting the hell out right now! - [Andy] Oh, please. He practically waved it in front of my face! - If there is a God and he truly wants to punish someone, he starts by making them mad. - Do you mean furious or insane? - Both. - Andy made a pass at Beetle? - He practically molested him. We're gonna be lucky if Beetle doesn't press charges. - Beetle wouldn't do that. - Oh, my head is splitting! - [Karen] I'll get you some water. - Grady, I want to talk to you. - How's your back? Weren't you supposed to be leaving? - There's a storm coming! Flights out of Atlanta are grounded. - You've got a rental, drive! - To New York? - Why not? - Grady, please stop. Please stop. - Don't touch me! Is nothing sacred to you? (choking) You hate me and you want me to go away, don't you? - [Karen] Grady! - I won't let you get away with it! - [Karen] Grady! Stop! - What are you all trying to do to me? - Shh! - You wanna kill me. - Grady. - You want me to die, don't you? - We don't want you to die. We don't want you to die. - [Grady] Get off me. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. (music slows down) - Is there anymore breakfast? - Okay, I can't stand by and watch you destroy everything you've built here. - You have no right. No idea what I'm feeling right now. - I know that you're hurt, and I know that you're lonely, and I know that some people close to you have done some pretty horrible things, but we love you. (sighs) Are you taking your meds? - There will be within the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude. - Are you taking your medication? - Like clockwork. It's feeding time now. (eerie music) They're getting smaller. - What's getting smaller? - My blue pills are shrinking. - Okay, let's just save that decision-making stuff for another day. - Yeah? What's to decide? - I am really, really worried about you. - You're worried about your investment. - I'm worried about your health, I'm worried about the fact that you're not fitting in, I'm worried that people up here don't like you. - Who said that? - You did a minute ago with that power walker. - I don't give a damn what she thinks, she can go to hell! - Don't be like that. You have such kindness and integrity, just hold onto that. Adjust behavior and fix your reputation while you have a chance. I want you to see a doctor. I want you to consider resuming treatment in New York. - I can't, I can't, I can't leave and go into treatment, I have a business to run. - Grady Wilson. From what I see, you are in no condition to run a business. (rain sprinkling) (mysterious music) (laptop slams) - Any luck? - Its neck is broken. - At least it wasn't yours-- (creaking) - [Rye] Hey buddy! - I, uh, thinking of a filet and grilled sole for dinner, kind of a surf and turf. - Okay. - Sounds good. I like sole. - Great. I'll run to the store right after I walk the dogs. Anybody want anything? - No thanks. - A little bit of the bipolar. - Ya think? - Don't joke. - I wish. He scares me. - What was the name of his doctor in New York? - Ben Fiensburg, Ben Fienstein. - Which? (dark eerie music) - Hey Beetle, listen, I got a little carried away in my head earlier, I'm sorry. - Can't say that I blame you, not one bit, I'm sure Andy deserved everything you threw at him. - You know, I even considered snatching Andy's cell and calling the new boyfriend to warn him. - Not a bad idea if you ask me. - No, no, I reconsidered. So not cool. - Grady, I hope you don't blame me. Last thing I want is to be in any kind of trouble. I could go if you want. - It's raining cats and dogs out there, where are you gonna go? No, you should stay here. - You're a good man, no matter what they say. I have respect for you. True respect. Grady? Who's Manny Knowles? - Why? - Isn't he that famous actor? - Did someone mention him to you? - Well, not to me specific, but I overhead some things. - Tell me what they said, exactly every word. - Well, Andy said to Karen, "If it weren't for your deceit, "none of Grady's mess ever would've gone down," and Karen said something like, "low blow," and they started calling one another names. And Andy just shouted Manny Knowles. (dark mystery music) - There are 17 different Fiensteins in New York. (echoed voices chattering) - [Andy] Can't stop. (echoed voices laughing) - People up here don't like you. (chattering, laughing continues) Who's that? (door thuds) - [Rye] Was that the door? - No, I'm not a relative, but I am a close friend. No, this is urgent, Grady is becoming violent. No, I'm in North Carolina with him, he doesn't know that I'm making this call. Well, Grady thinks that we're trying to kill him. Yes, he's had flu-like symptoms, mood swings, hostility. He's had tremors and-- - Tell him. - Oh, he said that he had a really terrible headache. I'm sorry, Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome? No, but I've seen him take his pills. Oh, you don't have to do that. - [Beetle] Oh, I'll be out of your way in a jiffy. - You're not in my way, I just have to grab a sweater or something. - [Beetle] Is Grady gonna be okay? - Um, yeah, I hope so. We think maybe seeing his doctor in New York for a few days might help. Might you consider staying on here and looking after things for a while? - I'm here to help out in any way you see fit. Doctor visit or not, a trip to New York sounds exciting for him. - Hey, you know, later, if you ever think about coming to New York, I'll do what I could to help you get started. - You'd let me? - Um... Yeah! Yeah, I would. - I'm deeply moved, Karen. Nobody's ever offered to help me like this before. - You're welcome. (upbeat music) - Excuse me. Grady Wilson, from up at the lodge? - Yeah. - I hadn't received my pay from you. - Excuse me? - I snaked your pipes. - Oh, you must be Arlis. Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you face to face. Thank you for your excellent work. - If you're satisfied with my work, why haven't you paid me? - Well, send me a bill and I will. - You have my bill. For a $160, you do. - There must be some misunderstanding, I haven't seen-- - Suppose you pay me now. - I don't have any cash on me right now, Arlis. - Figured that. Disrespect. And the way you treat that poor kid, especially with what happened to his mother and all, I pity you, sir. I shall pray for you. - What are you talking about? - Good day, sir. Enjoy your fancy steaks. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Man] Grady. - Hi, Dr. Fienstein. - [Dr. Fienstein] I have heard from your friend Karen Killington. I'm concerned with your medication's effectiveness, I have called in a new prescription for you. - I don't want a different prescription. - [Dr. Fienstein] You don't have to take anything you don't want, but they say you're acting very strange. - You know, it's not me, it's them. My boyfriend dumped me. He tried to hit on this poor kid at the lodge who's working for me, I just found out that my best friend is responsible for killing my acting career, and my new business is practically broke. - [Dr. Fienstein] All the more reason to adjust your medication now, Grady. - (sighs) No, I won't do it. - I understand. Thank you. Dr. Fienstein says that he believes Grady's mood swings could be justified. Did you tell Grady about Manny Knowles? - No. - Well, he knew. Or Grady told his doctor. He said he called in a prescription anyway, but he doesn't think that Grady's gonna pick it up. (phone ringing) Barry, I am sorry, I'm not gonna be able to talk right now, I'll have to catch up with you on Mon, no, Monday. Thanks. - Let's go get his prescription. (intense rhythmic music) (loud thud) (whooshing) - Grady, come on down for a second. Honey, I'm sorry (mumbling), is that okay? Hey, no matter how mad you are at me or what you think of me, I do have your best interest at heart. - You'd sell me out or anyone else for that matter without a second thought if it suited your needs. - What are you talking about? - Manny Knowles, Karen. Your new star client, the one who just happened to step in and replace me after my first day on End of the World. Manny pretended to be my friend. I introduced him to you. One day he's a bartender, the next day he's got my role on a major motion picture. - It was political, Grady. The director met him and liked him and our offices knew that he was safe to go mainstream. - This is about my sexuality? Nobody knew that I was gay. - Nobody knew yet. - So you decided to bury me before somebody else did. - I made a decision to invest a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity into the career of a safe bet. Your behavior after is what buried you. If I had to do it all over again, I would, I know that now, forgive me for your sake, not mine. - You know, I was gonna ask you for a loan to keep this place going until spring. - Whatever you want, it's yours. - No, no, no, no. No more guilt money. God, no wonder you can't sleep at night. Don't call my doctor, don't talk to my friends behind my back, and please don't pretend to do me any more favors. - Here you go. Do whatever you want with them. (mysterious music) - So they say they got room on a flight tomorrow out of Atlanta. You wanted four seats, right? - Yeah. Four seats. Use my credit card. About last night, sorry if my behavior was inappropriate. It's an unfortunate misunderstanding, and I hope there are no hard feelings. - None whatsoever. If I were you, I'd give a heads up to that friend of yours in New York. - What do you mean? - Grady said he had a mind to steal your cell and call him. Crazy way he's been, there's not telling the damage he'll do ya. - Thanks for that information. I want that card back. (dark eerie music) - What are you up to, Beetle? (keyboard clicking) "Carla May Hobbs passed away yesterday. "Sources tell us she battled long time disabilities "including manic depression, "report noted she stopped taking her medication "and suspect Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome "lead to her apparent suicide. "Toxic level of prescription sleep aids "was found in her bloodstream. "Pentecostal Church of Christ announced "funeral services will be held as early as next week, "Mrs. Hobbs is survived by one child, "Wallace B. Hobbs, age 21, "Robbinsville, North Carolina." Beetle, I need your help tonight! (mysterious music) - You know, you don't look so good, I could take of that for you if you like. - I'm fine. Karen talk to you yet? - About what? - About you staying on here while I'm away. - She might've mentioned something. Whatever I can do to help out is fine by me. - Bet you'd like New York. How old are you? 21? Same age as me when I first moved there. Took me years to find an agent. Karen took me on back when she was an assistant. She's gonna rep you, too, right? You did ask. - Maybe. I suppose so. - To be 21 again. Starting over in New York City. God, things I'd do differently. - I can only imagine. - You know, our imaginations can take us anywhere. Somehow dragging our physical bodies along with us in the process. Hey, hey, you can chop those up a lot finer, here. Now roll your knife. (knife swishing) You know, Beetle, I've been thinking a lot about your family this afternoon. - My family? - Your mother in particular. Oh! What time is it? Shit, I gotta run out for a few minutes. - What about my mother? - I wanna found out a little bit more about her, that's all. - Now? - That'd be rather hard to do now, wouldn't it? Yeah, well hey, I just need to run out for an errand. Oh, God, what happened to that invoice from your good bud Arlis? - What invoice? - You know Arlis the plumber? Where's the invoice? I want to drop off his pay today. - In this weather? No, wait 'til Monday. - When do you expect me to pay him? Before Monday I'd imagine. - I don't know, perhaps. - So it wouldn't be ethical for me to keep him waiting on account of a little rain. - I guess not. I think it's at the desk. - Let's go check. - It must be here some place. Maybe the wind blew it. - Maybe. It'll turn up sooner or later. How much was it? (dark eerie music) Which way? - [Beetle] Take the next left and go on up to the top. - You know, one thing that I've learned that you might not have picked up on yet at your age is never to underestimate anybody. That's the most brilliant thing about the human condition and human behavior. Try as you may, you can never truly predict the reactions of another mortal. (chuckling) That's exactly what I'm doing right now, isn't it? Assuming that you can predict my behavior. Well, did you, Beetle? Did you guess my next move? Did you know I spent my entire career working alongside games and players just like you? Did you know that I often won? 'Til that last battle. Manny Knowles, you know about that. I guess after so much betrayal and humiliation, I just didn't want to play anymore. Lost my hope, I guess, well, you know what happened after that. Tried to off myself. Tried to die. Not today, though. I like this game too much. Did you predict that, Beetle? - I think you're losing your grip on reality, Grady, I really do. You're making me very nervous. - Why? You think I'm gonna try to touch you or something? - It's on the left. - Huh? - His place is on the left. (brakes squeak) - Well, come on. He's your friend. (knocking) Hey Arlis. Sorry to just drop in like this, but we got some money for you and some beer if you like. - Well don't just stand there letting the cold in, come on in. - I sure do apologize for not being there when you were working yesterday, Arlis. - It's alright, I guess. - I just wanna say that when you came-- - But Beetle here insisted on coming with me tonight, see, he feels real bad, don't you? Don't worry, he'll understand. See, Beetle feels bad on account of he lost your invoice. Seems the wind blew it off somehow. He never gave it to me. - Is that right, son? - Well, it was there waiting for him, I guess the wind took it. - Anyway, he wanted to apologize for putting you and I in an awkward position. Is there some way I can make it up to you? - The beer and the check is just fine. Accidents do happen, I suppose. - Yeah. We should be going. Got a bunch of folks back at the lodge waiting on supper. Come on, bud, we got hungry guests to feed. Chop chop! I couldn't have done any of this without Beetle. To Beetle. - [Karen] What's this other plate here for? - Oh God, I thought for sure she'd be here by now. - [Andy] She who? - Beetle's mom. Can't imagine what's keeping her. I ran into her in town today. Now before you say anything, buddy, I want you to know, we had a nice talk, I told her all about your successes and your new friends, and she just wanted to stop in and see you before, you know. - Before what? - Before he moves to the big city and starts his life as an actor thanks to his new agent Karen. - Well, I did offer to help if that's what he wanted. - Well, it is. We talked at length about his future. Good call, Karen. He's got what it takes. Maybe even more than I did. Boy, your mom couldn't have been prouder of you today. She's a nice woman, I see where you get your charm. She just wanted to see you and know you're okay. - I didn't know you even knew her name. - Sure I do. It's Carla May. Carla May Hobbs. Let's start without Carla May. (dark mystery music) I never met a Pentecostal before. Carla May is Pentecostal. You handled live snakes in your prayer services, right? - Snakes? - We did a couple of times. - [Karen] Did you handle a snake? - Once. - [Karen] What happened? - I didn't get bit. - Wow, you're one of the Lord's chosen. If you handle a snake in church and it doesn't kill you, you're one of God's chosen few. - Congratulations. (dark mystery music) (hissing) - Clear the left sink, scrape, put the dishes in to soak for a couple of minutes before you scrub them. What, it'll make cleaning easier. You're doing well. - Not doing much of anything. - Exactly. That's the way I like it. Oh, where you going? - Collecting the rest of the dirty dishes. - Nah, you stay put, I'll do it for you. Don't forget those pots and pans over there. (dishes clanging) (rhythmic music) Yes, it's a much nicer room, only 35 more a night. Great. Alright, bye-bye. - Grady. Come sit with us for a second. - Sorry, work is never done here. - We want to talk to you. - Sounds like trouble. - [Karen] Oh no, not at all. - Is this act for real? - Act? - We have a ticket for you to come with us. I mean just for a couple of days, you know, see your doctor, make sure everything's okay. - Look, you don't have to sell me on the trip, I'm cooperating. Beetle can manage while I'm gone. - Or it is a slow season, you could just close up. - Beetle can manage. After tonight I'll go with you wherever you want me to go. Oh, dishes done, Beetle? - [Beetle] Yes, sir. - Great, would you care to join us? Hey, while you're up, could you put another log on the fire? Ooh, looks like we're out of wood. I'm gonna have to go up to the barn and split some more. Come on, Beetle. - I'll help you. - No, no, no, no, you're a guest, you sit and you enjoy your beer. Come on. - Beetle, keep an eye on him, something's not right. - [Grady] Beetle! (dark eerie music) - What are we doing here? I thought we were going to the barn and get fire wood? - I want to show you something first. - Let's talk hypothetically for a second. If you were a good-looking poor kid with a decent head on your shoulders and absolutely no morals, what would you do? - I'd find a gullible new guy in town and... Try and take over his life. - What's all that supposed to prove? - Don't you know better than to mess with a guy who has nothing to lose? - There you go again. Not appreciating everything you've been handed. - Handed. Handed? Is that what you think? Everything comes with a price. - What would you know about that? - I know that you killed your mother. You made it look like suicide. That's what you do, right? What did Carla May do? Catch you dealing, threaten to turn you in? - She had it coming. You'll never prove anything, who'd ever believe I'd do something like that? - I would. - [Grady] Threaten to turn you in? - [Beetle] She had it coming. You'll never prove anything. - I guess if no one shows us we're wrong, man's destined to repeat his mistakes, and that's exactly what you're doing, Beetle. Repeating your mistakes. Police are onto you. And all they need's a little bit of evidence. - There is nothing that Beetle has done that's questionable. It's all in Grady's head. Tell me something that Beetle has done wrong, and I'll consider your theory. - It's just that, a theory. - If I die, at least I will leave something behind, it might even be in national reports. What ever happened to Grady Wilson? Tragic. A victim of society before the gay movement. They might even consider me a hero. - Hero? Nah. Tragic, yes, sir. Homosexuals deny the Lord's path, and His judgement-- - Your truth. - Is a far a greater punishment than I could ever give. - Do you honestly believe that God wants you to hate another man, kill another man? - You don't know my Lord. - You don't either, Beetle. You've committed every sin in the name of God. - God helps them that helps themselves. And the proof is I've already won. They're sending you to the hospital and asked me to run the hotel. - It's a lodge! And you can't silence me forever. - [Beetle] Can't I? Compliments of Ms. Karen. - I've set you up, Beetle. I already talked to the police. They're gonna be here any minute. - I guess I better hurry then. How many you think it'll take? I got 30 here. (sputters) - That'll be 29 now. - This will never work, Beetle. - Of course it will! Just come back with some fire wood, tell them you were tired and went to bed, and in the morning, you're dead. Poor Grady, he was so weak. (intercom ringing) - [Woman] There's a huge tree down at the bottom of the hill on the main road, there's no going in or out unless you take the Tail of the Dragon back into Knoxville. - [Woman] Is that where you came from, Knoxville? (woman mumbles) (radio beeps) (suspenseful music) (gun thuds) - Well, a little bit of a blackout never scared me, man. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you, that is so nice of you. No really, don't you all go making a fuss. (dark suspenseful music) (grunting) Where is Grady anyway? - [Rye] He's out back chopping fire wood with Beetle. - I would not turn my back on that one. Vile creature. (thunder rumbling) - Who is it? - That's Grady. (rain pattering) (intense music) Move him to 11 and set him on a bed. (woman chatters) - Do you have a pulse? - [Andy] It's weak. - Grady, Grady, talk to me. - I'm gonna call for help. - Grady, Grady, come on, bud. Grady, no. Grady. - [Karen] Grady. - He forced some pills. - [Rye] You can still roll over. - [Woman] What can I do? - Go help Andy. (Grady gagging) - [Grady] He's got my gun. (gasps) - [Beetle] Did I scare you, Ms. Roslyn? - You hurt Grady, didn't you? - I didn't hurt anybody. I've been chopping wood. What's wrong? - I'm tired of loving youth and kings of deception. - What are we gonna do? - Um, it'll be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. - Damn it. Got no phone reception! Roslyn, can I try yours? Hello. - [Beetle] Andy. What the heck's going on? - I was hoping you could tell me. - [Karen] Andy, come quickly! - [Rye] He's gone. - Grady. Grady. - Our Father which art in heaven, hollowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil-- - They're getting smaller. - What's getting smaller? - For thine is the kingdom. - [Grady] The blue pills are shrinking. - The glory forever and ever, amen. (dark suspenseful music) - You did this, you son of a bitch! - Stop, stop! No! Don't be ridiculous! We tried to do everything that we could! I don't know exactly how this happened, but we tried to get the pills out of him, and it was an overdose. It was another overdose. There was just too many. - [Rye] If you were a good-looking poor kid with absolutely no morals, what would you do? - Thank you for that lovely prayer, dear boy. - Roslyn. Where's Roslyn? - [Roslyn] I wouldn't turn my back on that boy. Vile creature. - [Grady] Everything will make sense. Tomorrow morning with you whenever. - [Andy] Roslyn! Her car's still here! (echoed voice chattering) (suspenseful music intensifies) - [Karen] Beetle! Beetle, wait. - What, Ms. Karen? (body clattering) - Oh my God. (grunting) (foot thudding) (gentle guitar music) - I don't think we have much time left. - If you grab it all, I've got this. - The storm took down the whole tree at the Monouth Pass. No one was getting or out 'til we got a crane on it. - Well, I'm glad you're here now. And hopefully the phones will be back on soon, too. - So help me out, Mr. Wilson. You called the station last night saying this kid was up to no good. - Yes, I did. - [Office] And a few hours later, he's dead at the bottom of your stairs. - So sad, isn't it? I mean, he had such potential. - You say the boy stayed in the room with the flags? - Yeah, room five, just for the weekend. - Found a mess of drugs and empty wallet in the vent. - It appears you were correct, Mr. Wilson. We'll run a toxicology on Wallace Hobbs, it appears drugs may have played a role in his accident. (engine revving) - Be happy. - You too. (lighthearted music) Excuse me, miss. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me! You're wearing earphones. - Yeah. - I'm Grady. - [Woman] Marcia. - I see you walking every day, I just wanted to say hi and extend an invitation for you to visit for coffee or water, you know, hydrate. It gets lonely up here, and I'd like to get to know my neighbors. - That's nice. Another day. We'll see you later, Grady. You have a really nice aura.
