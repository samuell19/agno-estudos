[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [grunting] [whistle blowing] [audience cheering] [music continues] [cheering] Mike. Hey, Mikey played a good game today, huh? -He did okay for himself. -Okay? The kid's another Lynn Swann, are you kiddin'? Are you still considering the University of Pacific for Mikey? He's just a junior. We'll talk about it next year. Look, we got a good school. No kiddin'. My daughter goes there, remember? He's too young to recruit, Coach. Hey, listen, it's never too soon to give it some thought. He'd probably be closer to home. -He'd never be heard of again. -Come on, Mike. Dave, there were four recruiters out there that I recognize. S.C., UCLA, Stanford and even Penn State. Yeah, but if he takes a scholarship in a big school, he's gonna be a little fish in a big pond. If he comes into my program, he's gonna be a big fish-- In a little pond. Dave, I know your program's in the toilet and that your head's on the chopping block. But the boy, he's too young to recruit. I gotta go see my kid. And, Coach, you better win some games this season or Mike Moran the Tire Man won't be the only guy retiring this year. See you. Son! So, what ya think? I think the quarterback stinks. Dad, we won the game. Yeah, you had to pull out in the closing second. You should've beaten the pants off of that team. Yeah. I'll see you later. I'm meeting some friends. -Need any cash? -No. Anyone that drinks doesn't drive. [mellow music] (Mike) Son... you, you played one hell of a game. (Joe) There were Notre Dame scouts that night who didn't notice the drop pass because they were watching the quarterback. [music continues] Well, that was 32 years ago. Mike came out of South Shore High School an All-America. He and I both got full boat football scholarships. And along came something called Korea. After the war, I got to use my football scholarship. But, uh, Mikey, well... Mike's dad died, so there was no more school and no more quarterbacking, but he was always there to help his family. With a lot of sacrifices and a lot of hard work, he turned what was once a small family-owned tire company into what is now recognized as a sovereign nation by the Internal Revenue Service, huh? [laughter] Well, congratulations on your retirement, pal. And have fun with this. [applauding] Come on. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. Thank you, employees. Without you, the Moran Tire Company wouldn't be what it is today. And I wouldn't be in a position to retire. I wanna thank my sisters and their husbands and I wanna thank God for my lovely wife... and for my beautiful family. Thank you again for coming. Hope you have a nice night. Who knows, maybe I'll see you on the golf course. Goodnight. [applauding] (Scotty) Mm. Nice night, huh? It's a great night. Thank you. So...what is your first official act of retirement gonna be? My first act of retirement, turn in early and sleep late. Then what? Then I'm taking you golfing at the country club. No, you're not, because, uh, I've a board of directors meeting at the center tomorrow. Great. But why don't you take the boat out? Go with Mike and go fishing. Hm? Because you know your son hates fishing. Besides, it's his last year of high school. I have to make sure he takes the right scholarship. This is your time to relax. Why don't you stop worrying about his scholarship? Because the right scholarship means a big college where you play with the best against the best. And he'll know what he's made of. Mm. Enough football talk. Let's huddle. What are you doing? I'm cooking breakfast for you. What's it look like I'm doing? This I don't believe. Well, you cooked for me for 22 years. Now it's my turn to cook for you. [car horn honking] There's my ride. Gotta go. Thanks for the thought. Have a nice day at work, dear. Who are you, and what are doing in our kitchen? I'm cooking a cheese omelet for you. Gee, Dad, I can't stay. I gotta go to practice. Thanks for the thought. Who's this strange man cooking eggs in our kitchen? You just shut up, sit down and eat. Now he tells me to shut up. You finished? We'll throw the ball around a little bit. I can't, Dad. Tracy's driving me to Paul's. A couple guys going to the Harbor Street Canal, jump off the docks. Hey, that's dangerous. You're the one who showed me that place, remember? Yeah, well, if you're coming with me, junior, we gotta go. You break your leg, you lose your scholarship. I'll be careful. I burnt the bacon. Yeah, you turn that and... Mikey, I just shot the best game of my life. Come on with me, I wanna show you something. Guys, guys... I want you to meet a buddy of mine, Mike Moran. -Pleasure. -My friend, my client. And the best quarterback I ever had. Of course, he's the only quarterback I ever had, huh? Hey, Mikey, this is where you do your training from now on, okay? And I'm gonna lead the exercises. -Yes, Sir. -Thank you. I see more spare tires here than before I retired. [laughs] You gotta stay in shape, huh? Right, everybody? One, two, three, swallow. Yeah. Can you handle another one? One, two, three... You've had it, I can tell. [instrumental music] (Mike) How was your day? (Scotty) You won't believe what happened to me. (Mike) What happened? You are looking at a full-time, full-fledged, full-salaried counselor. -Congratulations, Scotty. -Mm. [chuckles] Thirty-two applicants, and they took me, Mike. Of course they took you, because you're the best. This deserves a bottle of champagne. -Alright. -Let's celebrate. I love you. I love you, Scotty. Will you love me even if I get a beer gut? What? Nothin'. [engine revving] A beer gut? Hey, what's on the agenda for you two today? Football practice, what else? I'm gonna go register for classes. -You wearing those? -My jeans? It took me a long time to get 'em like this, Mom. -I'll see you later. -Your father? In the garden. Again? Gardner keeps complaining he doesn't have anything to do. Dad's drivin' everyone crazy. Before he used to come to games. Now he's coming to practices, too. Mikey, this is hard time for your dad, okay? Come on. (Tracy) Come on. [engine sputtering] Oh, not today. Oh, Dad... When's the last time you put water in your battery? I thought water went in the radiator. You're a junior in college? I'm gonna be late for registration. -Take the Caddy. -No, I... I can't take the Cadillac. The car, it's... Will you drive me? You, yeah, you could drive me. -Please, I'm begging. -Don't beg. Come on. That was easy. Thanks, Dad. I have a new tape for you. Oh, I can't wait to hear it. [upbeat music] (Tracy) Do you ever think about going to college, Dad? (Mike) Me? College? You're serious. I am serious. Dad, as long as I can remember, you've been lecturing all the young guys at the plant. "Go to college, get a degree. "You wanna make tires the rest of your life? You wanna make me rich?" Yeah. Well, they did. They made me rich. What about mom? She went to school for 12 years, part-time. Yeah, well, your mom's smart, I'm not. Go register. No, I'm only talking about one or two classes. You'd like it. Besides, I'll have a ride to school every time my car breaks down. I'm beggin'. Please, Dad, please, please. Go on, get outta here. Go register. This is gonna take a while, alright? -I can get a ride home. -I'll wait. Maybe I'll walk over the field to see what kind of team Trumbo's got this year. Okay. I'll be in the gym. -Thanks for the ride. Bye. -Bye. [whistle blowing] [grunting] You call that hitting? Now hit that damn thing like you mean it! Hey, Mike. What are you doing way up here? I dropped my kid off at school. -Dave? -Yeah? Are you gonna win any games this season? [laughing] Yeah, I think so. We're lookin' a little bit better than I thought we would. I read in the newspaper you got Kevin Parr back. (Dave) Yeah. Take a look. [indistinct yelling] Red-22! Red-22! Hut! (Dave) Kevin's a junior out of Springfield. Hell of an arm. I was here last season when he broke the passing record. Yeah, now if I can just figure out a way to give him an attitude transplant, he's on his way to all-conference. -Who's your back-up? -Tanner. (Dave) A kid from Oakland. Get in there. Run post 22. Jordy Colwell. A walk-on-sophomore from some Podunk town in Ohio. Right outside of Cleveland. What he lacks in experience and finesse, he makes up for in sheer guts. Three-eighty-eight. Set! Hut! [grunting] [indistinct yelling] [grunting] [whistle blows] Oh, now what? Okay, guys, back on the field. Tanner, what is it? -Oh, it's my ankle. -Okay. Lay back, relax, breathe easy. What the hell happened to Tanner? Ankle. I think it's broke. Ah, jeez! -Get him out of here. -Yep. [groaning] Just don't stand there, Moran. Suit up. I need a reserve quarterback. Mike, I'd like you to meet my backfield coach, Denny Howell. -Denny, say hello to Mike Mo-- -Mike Moran, The Tire Man. I'd know that face anywhere. Hey, your commercials kept me up through some bad, late, late shows. Oh, you were the guy that was watchin', huh? [both laughing] Bring up the backs, Denny. Backs and backers, over here! Everybody else take a water break! Excuse us for a minute, will you, Mike? Sure. Excuse me, Sir. My name is Carl Malone, Sir. You're Mike Moran, right? You saw the commercial, too? That makes two of you. No, Sir, I, uh, I'm here on the Moran Scholarship. Yeah, sure. That's why that name sounds familiar. -They call me No Neck. -Well, I wonder why. I, um, I just want to thank you for choosin' me. Well, you wrote a good letter, Son. Yeah, my mom, she helped me with it. Anyway, I just want you to know I really appreciate it. If it wasn't for that scholarship, I'd still be drivin' my old man's tractor up and down the cornfields. Good luck this year, Son. Thanks. We're gonna need it. One other thing, Sir. Do you think I could marry your daughter? Get out of here. -Laps? -Wind sprints. [whistle blows] -Wind sprints, come on! -So, Mike, how's retirement? I'll let you know when I figure it out. Do that. I may be joining you soon. -Huh? -Yeah. The president of the college talked to me yesterday. I won't be back next season. -Are you kiddin' me? -No. Well, what if you pull it out this season? Hell, Mike, we ran $390,000 in the red for the last three years. There just aren't that many fans who will pay the bucks to come out and see us. You can't blame 'em. We went from six and four, three years ago to four and six. And last year, we were winless. Yeah, I know. Last year, a winless season. So what are you gonna do? I've got my resume in about a 100 schools. But would you hire a coach with ten wins and twenty losses? [scoffs] I gotta get back to work. I got ten days to make my final cuts. Thanks for coming by, Mike. It's always good to see you. I've got to watch some game films. Good luck. Good season. (Denny) Go! Go! [instrumental music] Okay, okay. Bye, see you. Ooh, jeez! I'm sorry-- I thought all the linebackers were out on the field. -I'm sorry. -No problem. Do you need some help? I'm lookin' for my daughter. I was supposed to pick her up. Her name's Tracy Moran. Tracy? She's a friend of mine. I just saw her a minute ago. She had to chase down a professor for an ad slip. -I'm Diane Novak. -Hi, Diane. I take a lot of classes with Tracy. -Journalism? -No. Philosophy. [laughs] I'm sorry, for a minute there I kind of thought you were trying to register. What's so funny about that? [both laughing] Do you think this philosophy course would be too tough? -Not at all. -There you are. I've been waiting out at the car. -Diane, you met my dad. -Hi. -Yeah. -That's great. She's my curriculum advisor. Your advisor? What, are you signing up for a class? Yeah. Dad, that's great! That's really wonderful! That's wonderful! What class did you get him to sign up for? Class? He took five classes. He's a full-time freshman. Yay! [chuckles] -Wow! -He what? -Fifteen units. -Hi, guys. Hi, Scotty. -Have a nice day? -Don't you be coy with me. I'm so proud of you. Oh! Relax, will ya? I didn't win the Nobel Prize. Not yet. Let me see this card here. "English, 1A. "Psychology, 101. "Intro to Geology. Very good. Greek philosophy?" I got that course from your friend. Freshman. That means you gotta wear a beanie. A beanie will never touch this head. -How did practice go? -More the same. Mike, uh, what is this? PEFB section one? Football. Football? Will you be careful? I mean, these kids are very serious about their intramural sports. Come on, you could get hurt. "Greek philosophy?" I didn't know that they had intramural sports at UOP. I didn't either. Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? No. No, he wouldn't be that crazy. Dad? Everybody out of the locker room? Yeah, except for the new kid. -Another walk on. -Who is he? I don't know. He was gettin' his equipment when I passed through. Oh, there he is now. Yeah, well, tell him to get his butt down here. I don't like people bein' late. Get your butt down here, Son! You call that runnin'? My mother can run faster than that! You wanted to see me, Coach? Yeah, when I say 9 o'clock, I mean 9... Mike. What-what are you... What the hell are you doin'? Oh, hell, you really had me goin' there for a minute. I'll be damned! That was a good one, huh? Still with the practical jokes. No joke. I'm here to play football. Oh, yeah, sure you are. You wanna run some offensive plays? Alright, I'll tell you what, I'll be the tight end, you be the center, Denny. You be, you be quarterback, come on. Let's go. Just like the old days. I'm not talkin' about the old days. I'm here to try out for the team. Excuse me for a minute, will you, Denny? -You're serious? -Very serious. George Blanda was 48 years old when he retired from the Raiders. Dave, I'm not asking for any special treatment. Damn you! You're 53, Mike! You can get killed out there! I can't let you do that. You're my best friend. The rules say that I have the right to be-- Don't quote NAIA rules to me. How about a little common sense? Good Lord, I'd-I'd love to go out there and play with the kids, but I can't. -I'm too old! -No! You're ineligible. You played your four years. I never took advantage of my scholarship. I went right to the tire plant. Mike, get outta here while you can still walk. I have the right to be here. The doctor cleared me. I'm a legitimate student. I just want a shot, Dave! Just give me a shot! Hut! Hut! Man, he's older than I thought. More like a senior citizen. I wonder if he's collectin' social security yet? Oh, man! I mean, he is older than my dad, you know that? I mean, can you see my old man out here? Hey, maybe he thinks he's George Plimpton. And what's he tryin' to prove? He's still a kid or somethin'? Oh, get outta here. -You know, what's... -Prove? Maybe the guy just wants to play football. Did you ever think about that? Okay. Black offense. White defense. -On the field, move it! -Yo, let's go! Hold on, Kevin. Hut! Hut! (Dave) Moran! You wanted your shot, you got it. Forty-four run and gun. Hit it. What the hell is 44 run and gun? Big time. Hit receiver. [instrumental music] -You tell 'em to blitz? -Yeah. You sure about this? No, but I want him to come to his senses before he really gets hurt. Forty-four run and gun on one. Ready? (All) Ready! [indistinct yelling] Set. 219. 219. Hut! [grunting] [whistle blowing] -Who called the blitz? -Coach called the blitz. Run it again! Forty-four run and gun on one. Ready? (All) Ready! [music continues] (Mike) Set. 219! 219! Hut! [grunting] -They call you The Hitman? -That's right. Could've fooled me. [music continues] Okay, we know what's comin', so let's give him some protection, huh? On right. G-slant. On one. Ready? (All) Ready! (Mike) Slant 13. Slant 13. Hut! [all grunting] Throw the ball! I don't believe it! Cheap shot, man! It's a late hit, man. What happened? You just got your first completion. -Yeah? -Yeah. [engine revving] Mikey, Todd, what are you guys doing up here? The same thing you are. There's no way your old man would try out for a college team. You wanna bet? Which one is he? I-I can't see which one he is. I think he's there in the back. Oh, God, no! [indistinct yelling] I think it's time to pullover and call it a career. There's no shame in pullin' out. Fake a cramp! [whistle blowing] God. He's gonna kill himself. Mikey, make him stop. Do something. Make him quit. Our dad? Quit? You gotta be kidding me. [indistinct yelling] [whistle blowing] [instrumental music] [panting] If you're gonna be the best, you're gonna have to play with the best. If you're gonna quit, just quit. Otherwise, get up. Come on, Dad! Show these guys what Mike Moran's made of. Did I like that old dude up with that blitz? You did, man. [music continues] Too bad. We needed a back-up. (Mikey) Come on, get up! [music continues] I'll be damned. [panting] [indistinct chatter on TV] -Where's your father? -He's not home yet. You know what I heard today? Your father is trying out for the varsity football team. Dad? You're kidding. Why do I feel like you both already know that? Come on. There he is. [dog barking in distance] [birds chirping] Tell me and I'll have a hot bath ready for you. You okay? What can I do? Well, you can open the door and help me out of this damn car. Mike. You crazy fool! -Oh, come on. -Thank you. -Wait, hold on. Okay. -I got it. [indistinct chatter] Is it so crazy to want to try something you never had a chance to do? No. It's not crazy. Just the other day, I, I looked at our children and I had this, um... this overwhelming desire to have another baby. [laughing] Now that's crazy. No. Scotty, I wish, I wish I could describe it. What? A 114 Charley horses occurring simultaneously? Now go on, describe it. You break from the huddle, you get to the line of scrimmage, you take the snap from the center and just then everything freezes. You can see everything. You can see the lineman starting to blow in. You can see the backfield making their adjustments. You can see your receivers going out in motion. You see it all and you're the key. God, I wish I could compete again. Well, there are safer ways to compete. Oh, I love golf. I love bowling. I even like the over 35 baseball team that I played on. But, Scotty... it's just not the same. Mike, you just can't compete, physically, with 20-year-old kids. I'm not competing against 20-year-olds. I'm competing against a 53-year-old man who can't run, who falls down, who's an embarrassment to me. Ah, it's probably all academic anyway, Scotty. I probably won't make the cut. Hell...I probably won't even be able to get out of bed tomorrow. [laughs] I just want to try. I-I just... I just want to try. Yeah. [indistinct chatter] It's a fashion statement. Look at that. This freshman looks a little lost. Dad, hi. You look sore. Do you need some help? Where the hell is lecture room D? C is back there and D should be here someplace, and it isn't. Now, what the hell kinda school is this that doesn't use the alphabet? Uh, lecture room D is in Bradley Hall, third floor which is in your freshman guide if you'd read it. Oh, you know, by the way, you left something in the car this morning. -Oh, oh. -Oh, oh. It will never touch my head. -You tell him. -No, you tell him. All incoming freshmen shall wear beanies while on the college grounds until after the football team wins its first game. My freshman year, we never won a game. Never. And so, Dad, if somebody catches you... -Oh, oh. -Oh, oh. Yeah, well, I won't tell anyone if you don't. -I'm late. Goodbye, ladies. -Bye-bye. What are you guys doing in there? -We forgot our beanies. -Wear your beanie, man. [dramatic music] He's suiting up again. Yeah, I saw him. You know, I really thought he'd quit. I'm gonna talk to him. Quit? I thought he might drop dead in his sleep. But quit? No, Mike Moran doesn't know how. Would you look at the old guy? Can't even tie his shoelaces. How you doing, Pops? I'm doin' okay. Want me to help you out with your shirt? No, I think I can handle the shirt. Second day is always the hardest. You're gonna feel like you got the worst case of flu you ever had. Now you get the urge to throw up, do it. It'll buy you five extra minutes. Get through five minutes at a time. You'll make it through today, it's easier. Mike, Coach wants you. Okay, here are the rules. Yesterday? Yesterday, you were a friend of mine who walked in here and did something really stupid. Today, you're just another player trying to make my squad. From now on, you'll call me Sir, Coach, or Mr. Trumbo. Understood? Sure, Coach. Mike...good luck. You're gonna need it. [upbeat music] [groaning] [whistle blowing] [whistle blowing] Why don't you save yourself some agony, Pop? Quit. [music continues] Hey, Pops, looks like you made it. Don't forget your beanie. [music continues] [sighs] So, how's it goin'? Pretty hard stuff, huh? Hey, Coach Hall showed us some new plays today. Denver used it against Houston. This receiver goes about 20 yards-- Do you mind? I've got two hours here... and that's just philosophy. Sure, Dad. Goodnight. Time for a break. Thanks, Scotty. Look, even Plato had to take a break for ham and cheese on rye. This stuff is over my head. This stuff is way over my head. Maybe you should have started with just a couple of courses. You know, get your feet wet? Carrying a full load and football is crazy. I choose to do it. I'm sorry. Tomorrow is the final scrimmage. Based on what they see, they're gonna make their cuts. Mike, it won't be the end of the world if you don't make the football team. You gave it your best shot. But I'm good enough, dammit. A little rusty, but I'm good enough. I know you are. Another reporter called. I told him that you were at the library, studying. Good. I'm so sick and tired of their stupid questions. "Mike, why are you doing this? "Mike, do you see yourself representing all men over 50 "who're trying to recapture their youth? "Mike, how do younger players accept you?" So on, so forth, blah, blah, blah... You know they're gonna interview me on TV tomorrow. Do you believe that? Oh, Mike... Oh, Mike. I just want you to remember one thing. You have a family... that loves you. People who like to see your face, hear your voice... Find a balance in this, okay? Yeah. And come to bed. Soon. [mellow music] Hut! [upbeat music] [indistinct yelling] He's gotta get that arm up. He's gotta cock that arm, Denny. Dave, I'm constantly on the guy to get up on his toes and cock the arm high. He's been doing it this way for 40 years. Old habits are hard to break. Yeah, well, at least he's finding his receivers. -Yeah, baby. -Yeah. Hey, come on, get on that one. That's the one. Alright. Thanks, guys. Nice drive. Set! Hut! I can't get my arm up, man. Hold it up just a little higher. -Okay. -Just a little higher. Alright. Set! Hut! Better. Better. Hut! Better. Yes! Set! Hut! [music continues] Right. -That's it. -Thanks for the overtime. Anytime. Thanks for the scholarship. -See ya. -Yeah. [music continues] What part of Oedipus' sad legacy has Zeus not laid in full on us who live? There is nothing better. Nothing of disaster. No shame. No humiliation I have not seen. Someone give me the name of Antigone's father. Oedipus. A man famous for what? Candlelight dinners with mom. [all laughing] He killed his father and married his mother. So Antigone is the daughter, and she is obsessed with love for her father. Sounds like a plot from "Dynasty." [all laughing] Philosophy expounding from Greek Theatre came from two sources. Comedy and tragedy. Someone give me a definition of tragedy. Not in your modern "Dallas" and "Dynasty" sense, but in Greek terms? Uh, yes, Mr. Moran, go ahead. After reading over this stuff last night, it, uh, seems to me that tragedy is about the basics. Man's purpose in life, his destiny, his nobility, his courage... How he stands up against forces that are stronger than himself. Tragedies seem to be not about events but about the heroes who bring about those events. I think. You think correctly, Mr. Moran. [bell tolling] See you tomorrow. Don't forget your beanie. [laughing] That was incredible. I mean, I knew the answer, too, but you phrased it so concisely. How'd you cut through all that confusion? You think the Greeks were confusing? Try reading 30 years of US Government tire safety regulations. Now that is confusing. See ya, kiddo. I gotta run. -Okay. Bye. -Bye. -Hi. -Hi. So...how's it goin'? -Take a look. -Where is he? Right down there. [indistinct yelling] What does he do, wash his uniform after every play? Very funny. -Ready? -Ready. [indistinct yelling] Set! Red 23! Red 23! Hut! [grunting] (male #1) Way to hit. Way to go! [whistle blowing] -Sixty-six draw. -Sixty-six draw! You guys know what's comin'. You know what's comin'. Nail him! Set! Blue 19! Blue 19! Hut! [grunting] -Alright! -Go! Go! Go! Give them a water break. [blows whistle] Water break! Way to go! That's some playing, man. Gorgeous series. Listen, if you roll out left, cheat a little, give yourself some room. You're gonna get blindsided. Are you the quarterback coach now? That boy's head's so big they had to order his helmet from a hot-tub factory. Yeah, but you were hot out there. You were hot, man. Route 66 draw? You snapped your neck when I went by, right? Definitely. So now you know why they call me "Whiplash," right? -Right. -Give me some. Hey, I hope you make the team, man. You got class. Definitely got class. Hey, Mike, I'd like you to meet somebody. Mike, Scott Triplett, Channel 3, "Sports Rap." -Think you can give us a minute? -Yeah, sure. Good man. We'll set up in a few minutes. I appreciate you bein' so cooperative with the media people, Mike. We haven't had a newspaper reporter down here in three years. Now, they're comin' down daily. I like reporters, too. It's the only time I get to handle the ball. [chuckles] Get out of here, will ya? They knew what play was comin' and they still couldn't stop you. -Yeah. -Would ya look at that? Hey, look at this guy. Hell, the old duff ain't even going to make the squad, he's got reporters all over him. Okay. Can we get a good close-up of him taking the snap? Bill? Uh, hut. Hut! And why don't you throw it? You want me to roll out and throw it, or just throw it? -Just throw it. -Oh, okay. Great! Wait, now, I'm the number one quarterback, right? Why aren't they interviewing me? They did, Kev. Don't you remember? The guy from the school newspaper, he did an interview with ya. What was the headlines? "Runaway Ego Kills Quarterback and Ten Others!" [all laughing] You got that. So, how are the guys treatin' you? Well, actually, the guys have been pretty good about it. The other day, they put a bottle of Geritol and a gallon of prune juice in my locker. [laughs] Uh, bottom line, Mike, do you see yourself as representative of all guys, over... Over the hill? No, no, but up in years? Well, actually, I see myself as representing one man, me. I just wanna play football. It's as simple as that. But if other guys see me do it, I say, "What the hell? I can do that," that's fine. I haven't even made the team. Kinda nice having reporters around. Sure as hell won't hurt the box office. You listen to me. If Mike Moran makes this team, it's because he's earned a spot on the roster, not because he's grabbed some spot on some news program. You got that? Sure, Dave. Sure. [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] Listen up. Every year, on the day I make final cuts I've got to do some pretty heavy soul searching. This season's no exception. As a matter of fact, it's been a little tougher than most. I wanna thank each and every one of you guys for coming out and giving me your best effort. If your name's not on the list, I don't want you to feel discouraged or feel like you've somehow failed. I wish to hell I can keep you all, but I can't. In my book, you're all winners. Thanks for comin' out. Ow! Stay healthy, baby. I'm on the team. Don't worry about it, rookie. [indistinct chatter] What you nervous about, man? You gave a 100 percent. Ain't no way they gonna cut you. You my good luck charm. Thanks, man. [cheering] Way to go, guys. Way to go. [music continues] Look, don't worry about your helmet and stuff. The equipment man will be by to pick it up. Look, I'm sorry, man. I'm gonna miss you. Thanks. Hey, Whiplash, don't forget. You go in motion to the left, not to the right on 32-slingshot, huh? Yeah, got it, man. Thanks. [music continues] Uh, hey, Pops, where's your beanie? -I gave it up. -No. No. See, I wear a beanie, you wear a beanie. Besides, don't look good for a football player to break tradition. Congratulations, Mike. -What are you talking about? -You made it! -I made the team? -You made it, baby! I made it! I made the team! Alright! Alright! [all cheering] Attention! Attention! Now, there's one more tradition. We now gonna do some serious partyin'. Let's go! Let's get it on! [upbeat music] [all cheering] [bell tolling] Whoo! This thing is awesome! This thing cannot be cheap! [whooping] Yeah! Oh! What are you doin'? This is a football party, right? (Whiplash) Hey, what happened to the music? This is a football party. We should be singing fight songs. Hey, what fight songs? What's wrong with LL Cool J? No. College fight songs like... ♪ Cheer cheer for old Notre Dame ♪♪ Alright, you don't know that one? Here's one you know. ♪ On Wisconsin on Wisconsin fight fight fight fight... ♪♪ Come on, you guys. Hey, Pops, I thought all those songs say field and yield. [all laughing] Alright, sing any old song. I-I know an old song. ♪ Hey I'm gonna make a fuss and I'm gonna raise a holler ♪ [mimics guitar] ♪ About a-workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar ♪ [mimics guitar] ♪ I head to the boss and try to get a date ♪ ♪ He says no dice son you gotta work late ♪ ♪ Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do ♪ ♪ But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues ♪ [rock music] [crickets chirping] [car engine rumbling] Goodnight. ♪ I'm gonna raise a fuss and I'm gonna raise a holler ♪ [humming] There's my girl. Guess what you're lookin' at? Go ahead. Guess what you're lookin' at? A 53-year-old drunk? Yeah, well, partially. But you also happen to be looking at the third-string quarterback for the University of the Pacific. Scotty, I made it. I made the team. Congratulations. Hey, Scotty, don't be mad. Come on, wake up the kids. Let's celebrate. No. You won't wake the kids up. Do you know that the three of us have been waiting here since 6 o'clock for the big news? The kids finally gave up at 1:30. I stayed up to see if you're alright. So, you're alright. Scotty...look, I'm really sorry I'm late. What are you, so into yourself you couldn't pick up the phone? When I found out that I made the team, I stopped by the fraternity house and, uh, it got late. That's all, it just got late. I told you I'm sorry, okay? No, it's not okay. I don't... I don't like this conversation because I sound like your mother, and I'm not your mother. I'm your wife. Do you remember that? [scoffs] [sighs] [mellow music] (Larry) Hello, everybody, I'm Larry Maneely along with Jack Bagnel. Welcome to another exciting year of University of Pacific football. I think the Tigers must have drawn about 500 people for their season opener last year. I look out here today. There must be 1500 people here already. You're right, Larry. And if you'll notice, a lot of those fans are over 50 years old. Why are they here? Number 13 is why they're here. Fifty three-year-old, Mike Moran seems to have captured not only a place on this team, but has fired up the imagination of a lot of football fans. (Larry) But he's attracting more than fans, Jack. I see mobile units from all three of the network affiliates. -This guy's news. -That's right, Larry. [fanfare music] [whistle blowing] [crowd cheering] [instrumental music] [cheering] Come on, Hitman! Come on, Hitman! [indistinct yelling] Set, 50 C! 50 C! Hut! [grunting] (Larry) Well, Coach Dave Trumbo's concern over a lack of offensive punch hasn't materialized, Jack. This restructured UOP Tiger group, three touchdowns ahead of a badly overpowered Missouri Wesleyan. (Jack) Here we are late in the fourth quarter and it hasn't been much of a challenge for our Pacific Tigers. [music continues] [indistinct yelling] [cheering] [whistle blowing] (Larry) There's another 15-yard completion and with it, Kevin Parr goes over the 300-yard mark. (Jack) Kevin's probably got his sight set on bettering his record of 3315 yards set a year ago. (Larry) I bet you, too, that's the UOP all-time passing record. (Jack) That's right. [indistinct shouting] [grunting] [whistle blowing] (Larry) They're bringing the stretcher on to the field now. From here, it looks like Kevin Parr's right knee was injured. It's my knee. It'll be alright. It'll be alright. Right there. I'm sorry, Kev. I didn't pick him up. It's gonna be okay, Kev. It's gonna be okay. (Jack) They're putting him on the stretcher now. Let's hope that's all he misses this season. Right on the inside. -Is he gonna be alright? -I don't think so. -Do you know who that is? -Oh, wow. -How is he? -No fracture. His right knee is hyperextended. -Goddamn! -Colwell, get in there. No, wait a minute. Hold on, hold on. Jordy, wait, put Moran in. (Howell) Colwell's our second string quarterback. Yeah, and if he gets hurt, then what? Look, we got six minutes left, we got a 21-point cushion. Let Mike go in, mop up. Okay, we might have a winning season here. -Just put him in. -You're in. Eat it up. Keep it on the ground. 32 dive, go. -Thirty-two, dive. -Come on, baby! Go get 'em, Mike! Do it up! Do it up! (Larry) Well, with a 28 to 7 lead, Jack... -Oh, my God. -That's dad! (Larry) Keep the ball on the ground, run out the clock and save Colwell in case Kevin Parr might be seriously injured. (Jack) I guess even a 65-year-old can hand the ball off for four minutes. Welcome to the war. Thirty-two dive. -On three, ready? -Break! He's not gonna run the ball and get hurt...is he? They're not gonna give him a chance. He's just runnin' out the clock. Set! Blue 53! Blue 53! Hut, hut, hut! [grunting] [whistle blowing] [indistinct yelling] Got any more great plays? Yeah, I got the same one. Thirty-two dive, on one. -Great. -Ready? -Break! -Attaboy, Mike, attaboy! [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [grunting] [crowd cheering] [whistle blowing] [all cheering] Alright! You're a winner, Mike. How does that feel? Well, thank you. But Kevin Parr is the winner. Anybody can sit on the ball for six minutes. A 22-yard touchdown pass isn't exactly sitting on the ball, Mike. Well, 21 yards, that's about my maximum range. [both laughing] Nah, seriously, you ought to talk to the guys who played the game. Hey, Hitman, No Neck, Whiplash, come on in. -How ya doin'? -How ya doin'? -We goin' all the way today. -Hi, Mom. Was I an awesome spectacle of manhood or what? It all started in a small town outside of Columbia, Missouri where my mother... Really? Hey, that's great. Yeah. -Hey, Coach, got a minute? -Yeah, sure. Come on in, Mike. Yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot. -How's Kevin? -Still no word. It's pretty bad, though. He'll probably be out for at least a month. Ah, that's too bad. Yeah, tell me about it. Hey, nice effort out there today, Mike. Thanks. Thanks for giving me the chance. You know why I put you in there, right? Sure. You wanted me to run the clock out, but thanks for the chance anyway. Just got a call from the ticket office. We made 14,000 bucks at the gate. I never knew you had so many relatives. Thanks, Coach. Good game, Mike. [mellow music] How you feelin'? Wonderful. Just great. They're gonna scope my knee, see if they can repair it. Oh, save it, alright? I don't need your sympathy. I might be doped up here, but I'm not stupid. You played a great game out there today, Son. Thanks, Dad. Look what it got me. You know, you're too short to play quarterback, Moran. You can't even see over the front line. [chuckles] You ought to tell that to Doug Flutie. Besides, No Neck, he lets me stand on his shoulders. Great view of the field from up there. What is it with you, Kevin? I thought it was us short guys that were over achievers with a chip on our shoulder. Alright, why'd you come up here? I mean, you could use the phone to find out if I was out. Well, I'm out, alright? So now you can leave. I came here to check on my teammate. So, I've checked. As a college quarterback, Son, you got a great future. As a human being... you got a long way to go, Son. [sighs] [audience cheering] (Jack) The loss of Kevin Parr is really taking its toll on this offensive team, Larry. Again, no gain. Looks like Ohio Northern stole UOP's playbook, Larry. (Larry) Well, that's very true, Jack. You know what we're witnessing out here, I think, is a case of extreme jitters by the young University of Pacific quarterback, Colwell. He's been intercepted three times today. [grunting] -Get him! Get him! -Get him! Come on, let's go, team! Let's go, come on! [indistinct chatter] Mike, I'm blowing it. Jordy, listen to me, when you're dropping back, you're looking at your primary receiver. Everybody in the stands can see it and so can the defense. Cheat a little, look at your secondary then pop your primary. [indistinct yelling] [grunting] [indistinct yelling] [whistle blowing] (Larry) Well, the only saving grace for the University of Pacific today, Jack, has been the play of that defensive unit. Especially the play of big number 99, Greg "The Hitman" Myers. That's his fourth sack of the day. He gives this record crowd of close to 5000 people something to cheer about. Now, go back out there and remember what I told you! -Be cool. -Moran! Moran! Moran, come on. You think you can move this ball club? I wouldn't be here if I didn't think so. Then get in there and do it, babe. (Larry) Well, here comes the UOP offense back onto the field. And, well, I'll be darned. Look who's leading them on. Mike Moran, who just, last week, in his first collegiate game, threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to ice the game for the UOP Tigers. (Larry) Moran gets hammered for a nine-yard loss on the blitz. Hey, get the hell off him! Then get him off the field and into the stands with the rest of the parents! (Larry) He really took a vicious shot on that one. -You okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. -22 post slant. -22 post slant. If they're gonna blitz, I'm gonna check black. Route 66 delay on one. Ready, break! [indistinct yelling] (male #2) Do something for 'em! Blue 10! Black 63, Black 63! Hut! [instrumental music] Hut! Forward! Forward! [music continues] (Larry) Called on to replace the struggling Jordy Caldwell in game two, Moran has been the starter ever since and hasn't looked back. Throwing for over 300 yards a game, he could break the Tigers single season passing record set a year ago by Kevin Parr. Calling Moran the heart and soul of our team, Coach Trumbo says, Moran is looking like a seasoned two-year starter and not a 53-year-old rookie. At the beginning of this season, Mike Moran was called a fluke, a miracle. Well, he's no fluke. Mike Moran is a winner, and so are his UOP Tigers. [crowd cheering] I made him everything he is. -What's your name? -The Hitman. Uh, Hitman, what's the secret of Mike Moran? -Double E. -"Double E?" Double E. Extra effort! Old dude gives everything he's got. Sometimes when the rest of us get tired, well, we look at Mike and suck it up. Know what I'm saying? This is Scott Triplett, Channel 3. Suck it up? What does that mean? Well, it's jock talk. Means dad's bad. Oh, please! What's your problem? -Nothin'. -No. Come on. What is it? I know dad's been real busy these last couple days. I mean, his mail comes in a big, grey, canvas bag. He's missed three of my games so far. That's okay, too. But the last game, he didn't ask the score, he didn't ask anything. This is the same person who only a couple of months ago was complaining how his ever-present father was ruinin' his life. -Will you butt out for once? -No. I'm tired of you moping all the time! She's always sticking up for dad. (Scotty) I said, that's enough! Can't we just sit here like a normal family, huh? [door opens] I gotta be an idiot. Most of the guys on the team are taking easy courses. I though you took those courses, originally, to learn something. You were on "Sports Rap" again. "Prime Time" may be comin' to our house in a couple of weeks. (Scotty) The TV show? George Parr called the public relations people at the University. George Parr? "Prime Time?" Alright, we're going big time! Excuse me. Hey, Penn State's playing Stanford this weekend. I called Joe Paterno and he has agreed to have dinner with us tomorrow night. I can't. I got a date. (Mike) A date? Break it. Penn State's passing game was designed for you, Son. Probably wants to talk you into transferring to Penn State. Knock it off, will ya? They already have a scouting report on you. This could be the contact that gets you that scholarship that dad has always wanted for ya. Great, Dad. (Mike) I'll probably watch some game films until around 6:00. So your mother will take you to the restaurant, 7 o'clock, and don't be late. Whatever you say, Dad. What's eating him? Well, I have good news. The paper called me today. Found out I was a Journalism major. Wanted to know if I want to do the feature story on the Mike Moran. What he's really like. 500 bucks. -You're kidding! -Nope. That's great! Well? Well, what? Should I do it or not, Dad? Well, you're almost 20 years old. You wanna do it, do it. -Just be careful what you say. -Sure. Mike, keep Friday night reserved for us. We're gonna have dinner at the club. (Mike) What's Friday? Friday is our 22nd anniversary. Cheers. [dramatic music] Yeah, sure. Excuse me, Mr. Moran. I was wondering. Could I get your autograph? Sure. What's your name? Oh, it's not for me. It's for my father. Stephan Cannell. He's a big fan of yours. -Thank you. -No. Thank you. Hey, men with old skates, you hittin' or what? -Oh, man! -Whoo! -Morning. -Morning. I only got halfway through the Plato text last night. Better hope he doesn't give us a spot test. Your leg okay? Yeah. Happened on Saturday? As a matter of fact, yeah. Did you see that game? I wouldn't have missed it. (Professor Willard) Morning everybody. I, uh, trust we all have some interesting perspectives on "Hemlock." Not your lucky day. Once you break out of the huddle and walk up that line, you're workin'. Check out that safety, see if he's movin'. Still giving lessons, huh, Moran? Just fundamentals. Enjoy the game tomorrow 'cause it's gonna be your last as a starter. Doc cleared me for contact Monday. -Good for you. -It is good for me. It's bad for you. Come a week from tomorrow, you're back on the bench. -Arrogant bastard! -Fundamentals. You know what I like about what you're doing? You're not looking at your primary receiver. -Yeah, you got that right. -Come on, let's throw a couple. [door opens] [door closes] Hey, Dad. How was dinner with the great Joe Paterno? Is Mikey gonna get a scholarship? -Where the hell's your brother? -He's not with you? I came home and he wasn't here. I thought you picked him up. He didn't show up. I spent an hour and a half covering Mr. Paterno for your brother. Your mother was supposed to take him to the restaurant. What happened? She left a message saying there was an emergency at the Childhelp Center. Great. But I see you got the paper. Read my article? What'd you think? Oh, yeah, I read it. "Over the years my father has contributed everything "from bleachers, to uniforms, "to weightlifting equipment for The University of Pacific football program." Well, you have. (Mike) You know what that sounds like? It sounds like I bought my way on the team. And another thing... I don't like people who read this garbage to know that I sleep in the buff. Well, I mean, that was a joke. You think my writing's garbage? I think what I wear to bed is nobody's business but my own. You understand that, young lady? [door opens] Hey! [door closes] -Where the hell have you been? -I forgot. (Mike) What do you mean, you forgot? (Mikey) Just what I said, I forgot. You know what I went through to get you this interview with Paterno? Yeah, you had to make a phone call. You want your quarter back? You feel better now? What is it with you? You've got a chance to play the game of football at one of the best colleges in this country. Is football a game to you, Dad? 'Cause to me, it's a job. A full-time job I've been working at since I was eight years old. Nine years of it, I am sick and tired of the game of football. What're you talking about? You love football. No, you love football. I'm playing because you love football. All I try to do is please you, and I have never pleased you. That's not true, Son. (Mikey) You know somethin'? Now that you're the big football star and you don't show up to my games, I've discovered something. Without you in the stands, I got no reason to be out there, none. It's all yours, Dad. I don't want it anymore. [ball thuds] Seventeen years, that's the first time I've ever raised my hand to that boy. Mike, his feelings shouldn't surprise you. They've been coming on for a while. Yeah, well, they do surprise me. It's the first time I ever heard the boy didn't want to play football. No, it's not. Because I've heard him. And you would hear him, too, if you were listening. Mike, you're not listening. And that crack about never pleasing me? That was pure garbage. That's a 17-year-old boy trying to express his feelings in an honest way. Football has never been a game to you, Mike. It's a way of life, and you can't push your way of life on other people. It doesn't work. What am I, a bad guy 'cause I want my boy to be the best wide receiver in the country? Will you stop pushing him? Let him choose his own direction. You know that crack that you made about Tracy's story, it was totally uncalled for. Uncalled for? I really don't want strangers to know that I sleep in the buff. She meant it in an affectionate, humorous way. And if you're taking yourself so seriously these days that you don't know the difference, that's your problem, Mike. Not hers. -You're living a fantasy. -Fantasy? Fantasy that I've earned. Earned? How do you earn a fantasy? (Mike) Thirty years of hard work. Thirty years of leaving this house at 5 o'clock in the morning and coming home at 7:00. Thirty years of a lot of sweat. And for what? So you people can turn on me the minute I get a shot at what I've always wanted to do? "You people?" I thought we worked all those years together, Mike. I didn't realize we were such a burden. We won't stand in your way. You go ahead, live out your fantasy. Oh, yeah? -Maybe I will. -No maybe! You pack you bag... and you see how far your fantasy goes. [dramatic music] [switch clicks] [music continues] [car engine starts] [engine revving] [music continues] [crowd cheering] -Oh, there he goes! -Alright! Whoo! (Larry) Jack, Mike Moran has captured the imagination of every man in America over the age of 40. I know he's captured mine. (Jack) I was in the parking lot before game time and I saw a group of grey-haired gentlemen wearing Mike Moran T-shirts. They were burning their social security cards. [Larry laughs] [indistinct chatter] Hey, Mike, thought you might like to know. College wants to give me a two year extension on my contract. -That's great. -Yeah, really, man. Why don't you call Scotty? Get this thing ironed out. She knows where I am. [grunting] [instrumental music] [crowd cheering] That completion just put him over the 3000 yard mark for the year. And with one game left to play, Kevin Parr's passing record of 3,315 is definitely within Mike's range. Well, I don't know about the rest of the over-40 crowd, but I know I'm pulling for him. Hm. [crowd cheering] [crickets chirping] The gladiator planning his moves for tomorrow's battle? [chuckles] Nope, just wanted to get away from the football house for a little peace and quiet. How those kids maintain a C average is beyond me. That's the jock mystique. They cultivate it. (Mike) What's with you? Well, I was on my way to the student union for dinner, and I saw your car in the parking lot... How about joining me? I'll buy. Beans and franks at the student union? I'll pass. I'll tell you what, I know this little bar and grill that serves the best food in this city. And I'll buy. You're on. That was the shelter. There's an emergency. I'll be back in an hour or so. Did you see the paper this morning? Last game of the year is tomorrow. Dad's got a shot at breaking the record. You gonna be there? I don't think so. But I want you and your sister to go. Your dad would like that. Finish your homework before the TV goes on. Are you and dad getting a divorce? Um... No. No, we're just having some problems. So, then, you will be at the game? [chuckles] I gotta go. [upbeat music] Thank you. I will never eat at the student union again. Well, at least not until tomorrow. [chuckles] Thank you. It was great. (Mike) No. Thank you. Do you know how pleasant it is talking with someone who isn't wearing a jock strap or trying to hit me with a wet towel? [both chuckle] My wife liked this place. We used to come here a lot. I'm sorry about all the trouble you're having. (Mike) It's okay. Tracy's been kind of upset at me. She's been avoiding me. Well, why would she avoid you? Because she knows that I'm attracted to you. And I think you do, too. You're supposed to say something like, "Kiddo, I'm old enough to be your father," or, "Gee, I'm really flattered." Both of those... and I am flattered. Would you dance with me? I can't dance to this. [Diane chuckles] Then you go put on something you can dance to, and I'm gonna go make a phone call. Okay.

Mike came into this game needing just 198 yards passing in order to set a new single season record. Do it, Pops. All the way. -All the way. -Hey, get it over with. Nobody's payin' any attention to me, huh? -You nervous? -Yeah. Looks like your audience is back. Huh? That's my family up there. Give 'em something to remember, Mike. Bet on it. Alright. Guess you're gonna do it, huh? Looks like it. You go for it, man. Do it. -Thanks. -Here we go. (Jack) Fourteen attempts and ten completions for two touchdowns and a total of 146 yards passing. And that's 52 yards short of the record. And that's what these fans have all come to see. Fifty three-year-old man fulfilling a dream. -Red 66! -Set! Two-ten. [grunting] [instrumental music] [grunting] [whistle blowing] One! [whistle blowing] [grunting] Ten hut! [crowd cheering] [both grunt] Break. -Two-ten! -Ten! Black 63! [indistinct chatter] Hut! [grunting] He's a long time quarterback! He couldn't take the hit! [clamoring] [grunting] [music continues] Oh, Mike, it's on... Get up. -Attaboy, Mike! Attaboy! -Alright, alright, Mike... [cheering] Let's go. [indistinct yelling] [grunting] [crowd cheering] [whistle blowing] (Larry) Well, this is it, Jack. I don't know about you, but I'm up for this one. (Jack) Four yards shy of the record, Larry. (Larry) One more completion, and Mike Moran goes into the record books. -Look at the fans. -They're going crazy! Remember, Mike, when you break the record, I'm the one who made the catch. (No Neck) For go for it, Mike. -Ready... -Break! [crowd cheering] Go for it, Dad! Do it! [cheering] Set! Set! [whistle blowing] Time out? What for? (Jack) What is going on? (Larry) Well, the only thing I can think of, Jack, is that maybe Mike wants to heighten the tension a little more. What's the hell's the matter, Mike? Thanks for the chance, Coach. What is he doing? I don't understand. Must be some kind of injury, Larry. I didn't see it. Boy, that's too bad. Hey, Mike, what about the record? You're thee number one quarterback. And as a human being, I'm improving. -Okay, Kev, come on. -Come on. Will somebody please tell me what he's doing? Mom? [laughs] [instrumental music] (Scotty) Mike? No regrets? No regrets. I just wanna come home. [chuckles] Not till you take a shower. [laughs] [chuckles] I'll get the car. [music continues] (Mikey) Dad? I don't understand. You needed four yards to break the record. Four yards. I got one record when I married your mother, one, when your sister was born. And when you were born... I broke the record. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, Son. Now do me a favor, will ya? Untie my shoe laces. My back, Son, is killing me. [chuckles] [crowd cheering] [instrumental music] [music continues]
