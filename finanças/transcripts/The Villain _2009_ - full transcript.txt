Well, well, Mrs Thomas! I was in the area and... You look in fine fettle on this lovely day. Mr Korazy, your obstinacy is bordering on stupidity. There are things I can't say on the phone. That's why I'm here. Not only are we prepared to pay handsomely for your house, but on top of that we can make a special effort. You see what I mean? No. I'm talking a backhander, cash, in ze pocket. You get me now? Think about it, Mrs Thomas. Think of your grandchildren, of the inheritance tax. You won't live for ever, Mrs Thomas. I wouldn't be so sure! Hello, Léonie. I brought you some flowers. Are you all right, then? Apart from all this, I mean. I wanted to ask you for a special favour. When... When... When you... When you get up there... I'm not dead yet! Of course not, don't get me wrong. You might make it yet. Don't put words in my mouth. But if... If, by chance or misfortune, or accident, you go up there, could you do me a favour? Because I... I think I'm cursed. Yes, really! Terrible accidents happen to me, and I escape without a scratch. It's a nightmare. Yes, you wish you were so lucky! But I can't bear it. I'd like to live a while longer, of course. A little more, a little less, OK, but... Not as a punishment. Sooner or later, your time's up, right? No! To tell the truth, I think that... He is annoyed with me for something. What did I do wrong? You know me, Léonie. I'm a decent woman. Is it something I didn't do? Something I should have done? Or that I should do? What is it? What? - You're not hurt? - No. No, not at all. What a stroke of luck! It's not luck. What? What? THE VILLAIN Cooey! Cooey! Mummy dear. Well, I never! I don't believe it! I don't believe it! What a surprise! You should have let me know. After all this time! Why now? I thought, after all this time... You should have thought that a while ago. Do you realise? Let me look at you. It's strange, seeing you here. It's strange for me too. And you're... You're... Don't you have any things with you? No, I came as I am. Oh, my little boy! My little boy's come home. Come on in. I was starting to think you never wanted to come back. To see me again. Oh, come on! Well, it's been 20 years. - Twenty? - Yes. Hang on... I left on a Monday. Tuesday, Wednesday... Oh, yes, 20 years. Flipping heck! Sorry, I didn't notice the time passing. You said that your studies would take 4 years and 5 months. Well? You failed your exams, is that it? That's right. And I didn't want to come back. I thought, "What will mum think of me for failing my exams?" I was a bit worried. You silly thing! Whatever you did, I'd be proud of you. I didn't think of that. Well, tell me. What have you been up to? Do you have a wife? - A what? - Are you married? Oh, that. Am I a grandmother? Not so fast! In theory you could have been, but in practice no. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. No, you're bound to be worried. So what job do you do? I work in banks. That's good. That's wonderful! What exactly do you do? I install cashpoints. You put your card in, enter your PIN... That's wonderful! They're going to build a bank in the neighbourhood. All the sold houses, eh? Yes. A developer is buying them all up and everyone's taking the money. It's terrible. And dad? Well, he's dead. Yes, of course, but what I meant was... He still is, then? Oh, yes. Butterfly hunting. - They fought back? - No, no... I bought him a nice modern net, but made of metal. And one day there was a storm. The lightning... It was beautiful. Well, at first. It took him two weeks to die. No hair, all stiff, dribbling... Just like a chrysalis. He took a real hammering. - Cripes! - Poor René. It's a nasty way to go, because butterflies... But you're alive. That's what matters, eh? A cashpoint installer. I knew you'd make good. Is my room the same? Yes, of course. You've never rented it out? Have a stranger in the house? Absolutely not! It's stayed the same all these years? It holds my fondest memories. Can I go up? It's your home! Stay there, mum. I'd rather be alone, because... It's more moving. Go on, my boy. Up you go. - Mummy dear. - Go on, quick. Untouched. Sidney? Are you asleep? I brought you some soup. If you want your teddy back give me your marbles Good pupil, exemplary behaviour! A cheat and a truant. Serious, diligent, intelligent and inquisitive. Congratulations! Nastier to frogs than to his classmates! A very good year. Well done! Useless, unpleasant and smug! His rare presence is a nightmare! Excellent at swearing. Filth, thy name is Sidney Thomas. I want to see your parents NOW! WILL SUCCEED... IN PRISON! Happy Mother's Day I understand. I understand now why You have forsaken me. I brought him up badly. But I'll make up for it. I'll do my best to fix all the wrong he did as a boy. I can do that at least. All the rest isn't my fault. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Cooey, sweetheart! Cooey, mummy dear! Look who's here. She's happy to see you. Penelope! Cooey, Penelope! The things you did to her! I LUV COCK Kids can be so cruel. She took it well, though. She's only a tortoise. Last night I must have fallen asleep. Spark out! Yes, I noticed. I put you to bed like when you were little. It brought back memories. You were a lovely little lad. I didn't make too much of a mess? A little bit. The floorboards were broken. I put them back. But I didn't want the light to wake you, so I couldn't see a thing. But you're hurt. Oh, that's nothing. It's... A work accident. How do you mean? It happens all the time. I was installing a cashpoint, the guard was cleaning his gun, and it went off! In my shoulder! No wonder you need some rest. Not half! Expecting someone? Oh, hang on... Silly me! It's Dr William. - Dr who? - Dr William. You probably don't remember him, you were too little. He was a young local doctor, with a great future ahead of him. Unfortunately... Unfortunately? He'd only been in practice a few years when there were rumours about him selling doctor's certificates and drugs too. Anyway... A nice man like that! They were only nasty rumours. Or maybe someone stole his prescription forms and was buying drugs with them. Nothing was ever proved, though. But you know what people are like. He lost all his patients. - He turned to drink... - Blooming heck! The usual story. - But why...? - Is he here today? For you, silly! You can't stay like that. It's nothing, mum, it's just a scratch. You can't walk around with a bullet in your arm! He may be old, alcoholic and past-it but he'll know what to do. I AM A SLAG Coming! Hello, Mrs Thomas. Come in, doctor. Who? You, doctor. Oh, yes. The thing is, I stopped practising a while ago. So, you see, I can't... Come now! I need you, doctor. No, no! Excuse me but... No, I can't. No, I... Not any more. What am I going to do? I'm all alone. Good Lord! Good Lord! Look, I... I don't mind trying to help, but... As long as it's not too serious. What's the problem? It's my son, he got in a scrape. Come and see. A bit of a scrape. What sort of scrape? A banker's scrape. - Meaning? - A bullet in his arm. Fuck! Doctor... I'm sure you can extract it. No, he needs hospital care. We can't do anything. Doctor, I have every faith in you. I don't even have my bag. I have everything. My father was a nurse in the colonies. Don't call me doctor. The pressure... Come on, old chap. You can't imagine how important this is for him. Be gentle with him, sweetheart. It's important for me too. Yes, you could die, but it could help restore his confidence. How wonderful! Can I come in? Yes. Hurt ourselves, have we? A little. There's a good boy. Go on. Oh, fuck! - You're on my hand. - Sorry. I'll have a look. Oh, fucking hell! Careful, that's alcohol! Be brave, son. It can't get any worse now. I can understand my memory being blurred, but it's odd for the patient to be too! Ouch! Yes, I understand. Edges of the wound burned, edges of the wound burned... Edges of the wound burned, therefore a bullet. Rotator cuff deeply torn... That's a problem. Bleeding under the clavicle... Bleeding under the clavicle, minimal. That's good. Nerve plexus, nerve plexus... Is it intact? Intact? Yes, it's intact! It's intact! Where's this cheeky little bullet? What can I feel there? Is that you, you little minx? No, that's the bone. We must have gone in too deep, and missed you on the way. Here it is! I knew you could do it. I was afraid I'd lost the knack, but... I haven't lost the knack. I'll fix your dressing. Hang on, gently does it! Take it easy! Back to my surgery now. Oh, yes. You'll need some... Some anti... anti... - Antibiotics. - That's it. Antibiotics. I'll write you a prescription. I can't, I don't have any forms. I found one of your old ones. An old prescription form? Yes, it's downstairs. On the dining room table. I'll fill it in, then. I'll check up on him when I can, but I'm not sure when... I'm a busy man. See you, son. Be a brave lad. Thank you. You were wonderful. I know it can't have been easy for you, but thanks so much! If I can help out in any way. Penicillin 500... One intramuscular injection per day, for... For ten days. I won't charge for coming out. That'll be 57 francs. Francs? Do you mind if I settle up later? No, of course not. Call me if there's anything at all. My... my secretary will contact me and I'll be right here. My respects, dear madam. Who's the strawberry for? Who's the strawberry for? I think I'll draw a flower. What sort of flower shall I draw? Well... A Papilionacea. I haven't drawn one for ages. Hello, Seedney. Ees everytheeng OK? I am happy to see you, my leettle Niño. My Dios, how you have grown! I'm sorry. You are? Carmen! The slut! I was having orgy in area, and feeneeshed early. So I thought, I go see my leettle Seedney. For a gang-bang! Sorry, I... A gang-bang, but only with the bang! Take it easy, madam. With beeg bang! There must be some mistake... Good Lord! Sid, what have you done? - Mrs Thomas? - Yes, that's me. Inspector Eliott. You were trying to get in touch. It's a disaster. I made a big mistake. Calm down, madam. I got Miss Somoza to come round. - Who? - Miss Somoza. She was the local Spanish teacher. I know. What has she done now? It's not her, it's my son. I wanted him to apologise for the wrong he did to her, to both of you, 30 years ago. But that's ancient history. And why your son? Because it was him! He sent you those photos. They were faked, you see. Miss Somoza never got over it when you split up with her. But it wasn't her fault. For all these years she's asked after Sidney but I never knew why. Now I do. I've seen the photos. Well now she's shot him. Whom has she shot? My son! I never imagined it would go that far. - Where are they? - Come on in. Carmen. Eet's nothing. Nothing at all. I am gueelty. Arrest me. He owed me money, I wanted to keell heem! Don't worry, Carmen. Mrs Thomas explained it all. So he was the culprit. Carmen, you really bear a grudge, don't you? I am not a slut! I never thought that. I suspected the photos were fake, but my colleagues saw them. It was simply that I didn't have... Any balls! I'll have to write a report, you've been shot. Come to the station. Hang on, hang on... This is nothing. And she was bound to be upset. I messed up her life. But now I've been punished. It's nothing at all. I've forgotten about it already. Come on... Wait a minute. You've been shot, I have to report this. Not if I don't press charges. There's no point. It's just a quarrel between neighbours. I'll do eet again! You see. Then I'll move away and never come back. I promise. I've been punished now. It'll be terrible to leave all this past behind. I'll just have to make the sacrifice. - You need attention. - It's nothing. I've seen to it. Hello, everyone! I'll bee back! Well, my lad, it looks like it's open season on you! Oh, dear... We'll soon fix that up. As usual. Be brave. It can't get any worse now. Don't overdo it, lad. It's nothing more than a scratch. The bullet's there! It's in the wall. It's in the wall! I thought I'd lost the knack, but no. I'll put a dressing on it. Yes, it'd be better without the clothes. The shirt too. So carry on with the... The antibiotics. Call me if he gets a fever. And if he could stop getting shot, he'd heal a lot quicker. We'll try. My respects, dear madam. I'm sorry about Miss Somoza. I didn't think things would get so out of hand. I'm sorry. Don't look at me like that. I'm sure you can be a good boy. You'll see, we'll make it. You'll never guess who's here. Who? Sidney! What are you doing? Come and say hello. Come and kiss everyone. Come and say hello. Good morning. I'm the one who called you. The flowers are for my mum. Could you ring for me? I'm superstitious. These old houses make me worried. They're not very sturdy. Do you mind? Yes? Coming! It was open. There was no need... Good Lord! As she loved to say. What a disaster! What happened? How? Such a good woman. What did you do? I don't blame you. We still have our memories. She wouldn't have wanted tears. We should remember her happy, singing, laughing, rolling out pastry... It's nothing. No harm done. These things happen when you live among old things. So, my boy, you wanted to kill your mummy, eh? Not at all. I heard a noise and I... But you're fine. What a relief! Sadly, it's not that easy. If all it took was killing me... It's your fault. You put a lot of effort into it, but nothing can happen to me. I'm cursed. Because I made you! And that's unforgivable. I thought that if you fixed some of your crimes, I might change you, make a decent person of you. But looking at all this... We're buggered, eh? I'm cursed. This'll be quicker than demolishing the house. Take it easy. Here! I pity you, believing in nothing. I believe you. God doesn't want you because I'm bad. It makes sense, it holds water, it's logical... It's just a rubbish old gun. No bullets. I don't believe it! Dr William? Yes, it's Mrs Thomas. The thing is... Yes, another gunshot wound. Yes, really! You're not too busy? Can you pop round? What a stroke of luck. See you. Old fool! Stupid bloody mumbo-jumbo! It's pure coincidence. - I can kill you. - Go on. Nah! I don't like sordid petty crimes. Anyone can do it with secateurs. That's a murder for illiterate Christians, for sad cases, for "decent" people. I deserve better. You have no idea who I am. I'm evil! One of this country's most wanted. I do bad. And I do it well! You don't seem that vicious to me. Excuse me. Hello, everyone! The door was open... - It's a bit of a mess in here. - It's nothing serious. There he is. More silly playing around with guns? You'll never get better at this rate. It's your hand this time. We'll disinfect it... It's alcohol all right. A good idea, son. Sleep is the best medicine. Come in! I'm in the kitchen, rolling out pastry. So he hurt himself? Poor little lad! Better for him to fall than you, Maniette. At your age it could be serious. He's sturdy. I'm delighted to tell you that the mayor's going to see us. I don't believe it! But how? It's all thanks to Sidney. They were at school together, and recently I found an old teddy bear, which used to be the mayor's when he was little. So I took it to him, he was moved to tears, and he promised to see us and examine our case. Unbelievable! Thank you, Sidney! The neighbourhood isn't dead yet. Let's hope! All is not lost! Great news! I knew we could do it. To the neighbourhood! Death to developers! PAINTERS What a mess! Look at all this! Some touching-up to do. I can see that! What a job, eh? Look at all this work. Let's get stuck in. Plenty to do. Here we go... You know what? If we've got enough plaster, we'll be lucky! What happened to your face? Everyone but you knows what happened. What do you mean? I got mixed up in that bank hold-up. Last week, in the town centre... I didn't know what was going on. They thought I was the robber! What? Lunatics! - Tell me. - He did it all on his own. He's pretty smart. He shagged the banker's wife and took photos, he nicked her wedding ring, then went to a morgue, and cut the finger off a dead woman. He convinced the banker that he'd tortured his wife. He KO'd the banker... He nicked the loot and skedaddled! Brilliant, eh? The problem was, he'd disguised himself as me. And I got nabbed. I didn't know what was going on. The banker was sure it was me. Unbelievable! And the cops fell for it? At first, yes. Not after. But it took a while. I won't go into details but they were a bit rough. He tricked his accomplices too. Everyone's after him, but he's un-nabbable! Un-nabbable! - Un-nabbable. - What? No one can catch him. That sort of bloke, eh? He's like an artist. A star! A lowlife who respects nothing! That's a bit harsh. Maybe his father beat him as a child and his mother didn't take care of him. Clichés! You'd make a terrible writer. I wouldn't have minded being a gangster. But my folks were too nice. The bastards! All right, enough time wasting! Excuse me... This wouldn't be yours, would it? That's amazing! But it was in my jacket pocket. Must have fallen out. Thanks. That's mind-boggling! I'm so lucky at the moment, it's incredible. Don't stay there, with all this dust. Are you coughing? She's coughing. - Can I offer you some tea? - Tea? Do we have to? Would you prefer beer? I wouldn't say no! - Cold beer? - Yeah! - There. - Thanks. Thanks. She's coughing. Coughing well. Is it nice? Yeah, yeah. Excellent. Oh, by the way, your car keys. Where were they? On the floor by his wallet. They must have fallen as well. - It's a day for that, eh? - Amazing! Feeling better, eh? Not coughing so much. You've got me worried, you know. - Do you have any idea? - What? Cutting off a dead woman's finger! You're a total scumbag. How do you know they meant me? What is all this? You're only being nice because you think it'll make me sick. You're going too far! If I try to kill you, you moan, if I'm nice, you moan. I don't understand. I'm completely at a loss. I find your naughtiness and nastiness depressing. It makes me ill. Hang on, mummy dear... She was dead, she didn't feel a thing. Feeling better? Shall I water the flowers? Yes, I will. Oh, the little minx, the little minx... I was ready for you. What a little minx she is. She fell on my head. I was ready, though. Oh, I swear... And stay there! Do you want some tea? Go inside, naughty girl! You'll catch cold. Go and play, you little minx. Do you want me to do that? No. A drop of milk? Of course, mummy dear. Gently, gently... Good Lord! Good Lord! It's obvious you're ill. Such bitter tea, from such a good cook. It comes to us all in the end. I'm sorry. Don't apologise, mummy dear. To show you I'm a good boy and to please you, I'll drink it all. Disgusting! Really awful. Of course it was bitter. Why's that? It wasn't milk. What was it? Drain cleaner. It's easy, see. I can kill you when I like, too. If you promise me, just once in your life, to do something really good, I'll tell you what to do. I promise, I promise! I'll do really nice things. I'll get married, I'll have children, I'll have lots and lots of grandchildren for you, I'll go to church, I'll pay my taxes, I'll be nice... I'll be so nice, so nice to everyone! I promise I will! There's a bottle of mucin in the bathroom. You should drink that. Thank you. It wasn't drain cleaner, and it wasn't mucin. Just strong emetics. Not only are you bad, you're a dickhead too. You know... For a "decent" woman, you're going a bit off the rails. What you call "doing something good" I call "getting shafted". No one in the world will make me do something like that. Especially not a "decent" woman like you. I can't help it. I'm cursed. He has cursed me. What did I do? I don't know. Why me? Why do I always have to be bad? What did I do to God? The neighbourhood will survive No to a banking quarter Death to developers Leave us in peace Drink some tea, Maniette. Here's to you! She doesn't look well. I hope she gets better. Here's to you! You'll be all right. It's the building work. It makes us all ill. That bloody developer! Twenty years ago, I'd have smashed his face in and got rid of him! That's the only language they understand. What we need is a contract killer. Bang! Done and dusted! Trouble is, I don't know any. I don't like killing. I've got a nephew who works at the abattoir for not much money. We could ask him. - Is he a real bastard? - Why? Only a real bastard could mess up another bastard. That's true. Yes. Bastards don't even like each other. - That's true. - Now I think about it... - He is a real bastard! - Only a real bastard will do. I'm sure of it. He's a bastard. It makes sense. I'm going shopping. Be right back. I'm glad you've changed your mind. You gave us a hard time, Mrs Thomas. Excuse me, but I'd like a few more details... At your service. There'll be no trace of our houses left? I won't lie to you. There'll be nothing left. Except for... Except for? Lovely memories of the neighbourhood where it all began. But on the banks and so on... Couldn't you put some plaques? Plaques? Where the houses used to be. Bronze plaques, you know. And they could say... "Here lived so-and-so, from such-and-such a date..." That's for historical personalities, not for anonymous people. Anonymous? Raymond, Huguette, Simone... They're not personalities. Not personalities? You've obviously never met them! Not personalities! Yes. I trust you. A simple promise from you would be enough. Look... Why not? It's a good idea, and a homage to this neighbourhood's residents. We could even erect a little monument, with a museum, showing how the neighbourhood used to be, with photos of the houses, pictures of the residents, letters... You're right. It's a good idea. "This banking quarter used to be a neighbourhood." We could inscribe that on the buildings, with a train for tourists from all over the world. A good idea! The more I think about it, the more convinced I am. Yes, yes... I misjudged you. Deep down you're a good man. What is a "good man" to you? Someone who commits himself, who sees things through, who works more than others because he wants to succeed... A hungry man! Well, that's for sure. I'm a good man! Fine, fine... You deserve to meet him. - Who? - My son. You'll see, he's a good man too. If he's a good man, I'll be delighted. Cooey, mummy dear! This is Mr Korazy. Who wants to buy the house. Delighted. Explain it to him. This charming but run-down neighbourhood will become the biggest... - No, not that. - What, then? What you said about a backhander, cash, in ze pocket. Yes, there's that too. I explained that we could buy the house in two different ways. The first way is, shall we say... official? And the other is a little more... personal. See what I mean? No. No? Well, I'm ready to conclude a certain part of the transaction in readies. Sorry? Part of the transaction in readies. I don't understand. Part of the transaction... Only "ah"? With all the inspections there are nowadays, this is pretty daring of me. Courageous even! Without naming names, those who have already sold didn't just say "ah", eh? What did they say? They said, "Aaah!" and "Oooh!" They said, "Good God!" We had two fainting fits and a bit of incontinence too. So it's dangerous? No, it's not dangerous. I'm just saying... You and I should discuss it quietly, to spare my mother an attack. Yes, I'll give you my card. Call me. My respects. Take care of yourself. I feel better already. Everything's working out. Call me soon. - Once I've worked out how to... - How to? Once I've worked out how to say yes without being too sad, because it'll be hard. This is where I grew up, you see? Oh, yes. Yes, I understand. We're not monsters. Ten minutes either way won't matter. Call me in a quarter of an hour! Goodbye. Are there still some houses unsold? All right, Huguette? About tea on Tuesday. Is it OK or not? Yes, it's OK. Yes, it's OK. Yes, it's OK. Yes, it's OK. It's... OK. I can't hear you. Is it OK? It's OK! - It's... - OK! - Who's that? - Really! It's Simone. - Liar! - Oh, really! Simone Lannier! Simone who? It's Simone Lannier here. - Can I trust you? - Yes, you can trust me. Yes, trust me. You can trust me! You can trust me! - No regrets about Tuesday? - No, no regrets! "Simone changes her mind," they say. I've never changed my mind! I've thought it through. I tell you it's OK. What time did you say? - Tuesday at five. - Five o'clock. I'm in a tunnel. Louder, Huguette! Tuesday! At five! Five o'clock! What? I never said that! Tuesday at five. - Thursday or Friday? - Tuesday at five. - If you insist. - Me, insist? - Me, insist? - Me, insist? With the readies. With the readies? Cash! In ze pocket! - Cash? In ze pocket? - Ze pocket. It's Simone. It's Simone Lannier here. It's Simone... Lannier. I've thought it through. Yes, it's OK. Tuesday at five o'clock. Yes, I'm sure. Trust me. Mrs Lannier? I've never changed my mind! With the readies. Cash, a backhander, in ze pocket. Hello? They've all been calling me since this morning. All wanting to see me the same time, same day. Just great! - They need the old folks' home! - That's for sure. I'll need an armoured truck instead of my car. What is it? Isn't Mrs Lannier in? Get out, you! Who are you? Mr Korazy. - Who? - Korazy. To see Mrs Lannier. Really? You're here to see mum? She never said anything to me. Well, she won't be long. Come on in. Come on in. Make yourselves at home. - And you are? - Her son. I told you! Are you deaf? I didn't know. I'm not the sort of son you brag about. Can I get you a drink? Tea, coffee, hot chocolate? - Tea, please. - Coffee. I've only got tea. Tea, then. Just as well! What do you weigh? Sorry? So the tea's not too strong. Well? You can make it strong. No, it's OK. Well, I weigh 85 kilos. - And my secretary... - 75. 85 and 75! If it's too strong, you get all excited. Like this, all day long. I'll be right back. I'm going to make some tea. Tea means health! Tea, I'm happy to be making tea. Tea is marvellous, I love tea. Long live tea. Tea is great, tea is magnificent. We'll relax over a cup of tea! Right, then. 85 and 75... I can walk! That's amazing! It must be the tea. I could feel something happening. Look, I'm walking! Incredible! It feels strange, it's so long since I last walked. Don't be afraid. I thought I'd lost the knack, but no. You shouldn't doubt. Sometimes He manifests himself to restore our faith. Look, look... Don't fall for it. It's pathetic! I've seen some cons in this business but never like this. You understand me! Don't fall for it. It's all so pathetic, all so predictable. I feel sorry for you. It's so petty! So, so petty! Don't come any closer! Violence doesn't scare me. Stay away. Stay away! Put the case with the others. Stay away! Don't move! Developer robbed, neighbourhood saved. I was about to do a good deed. A hell of a woman! The case! They're all here! Mum? I know you're there. Mum! I won't do you any harm. Any good, I mean. You know what I mean. You left the money? You almost had me there, but I sussed it out. I wanted to say... The reason I refuse to do a good deed isn't to annoy you. Why, then? Why, then? Because I don't want you to die. You're clever. It'd be a waste. We'd make a great team, we could screw them all! Where are you going? Mum! I AM A SLAG Don't bother, Penelope. He's not worth it. Come on... Mum, what...? They're crap shots but they're determined. Got nothing for me? Just one shot. Please! Come on! Make a little effort. Please! Oh, well... I don't believe it! Incredible! - It got me right there! - Yeah, I saw. No, I mean I'm moved. What? What were you thinking before they fired? Nothing. Yes, yes! Just before they fired that shot. I wasn't thinking anything. - Really? - Silly things... I don't remember. What did you think at that moment? That I care about you. I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you. That I care about you. I can't hear you. I care about you! I care about you. A bit. Is it serious? A disaster. It's like I'm not myself any more. I feel weak and feeble. Like I'm ill. No, I mean my wound. Is it serious? The shoulder. Is that all? It's pretty bad. Especially with that butcher... Hello, everyone! I heard a gunshot and I thought, "That must be the Thomases!" So where is the...? Bullet in the shoulder? This is a first for me: a genetic bullet wound! It's nice to be in pain. Korazy sold the houses and disappeared. Scared to death, I expect. A thief who doesn't thieve. Weird! The town hall bought the houses and put mum in charge. The mayor loves her since she found his teddy. She's only selling them to big families and old folks. It'll soon be like the hell of my childhood again: a place full of "decent" folk. She won, then. I did a good deed and saved her fucking neighbourhood. Or so she believes. To be honest... Just a figure of speech! I don't think Thingy exists. If He does, He doesn't deserve her. He doesn't deserve anyone. So I need to find lots of ways to screw Him. The only way I can keep that loser from taking my mum is by staying a bad boy!
