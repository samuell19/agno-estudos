You're Elisa Mandy's daughter, aren't you? I'm Marta Colussi. You really look just like her. I knew your mother many years ago in Germany. She was a wonderful teacher. I learned so much from her. She was a great spiritualist- the best I've ever known. - My mother was a dancer. - And a healer. A white witch, if you will. And it seems to me you've inherited some of her gifts. - Listen, lady- - It's Marta. Marta. Whoever you are... I don't know you and I didn't come here to talk to you. Please leave me alone now, okay? How did you get away at the train station? What the-Who are you? Elisa was helping you. Coaching you, wasn't she? l- I don't know. I heard- I heard a voice. - did you really know my mother? - Quite well. - You don't know much about her, do you? - No. I don't remember much about my parents. I was very young when they died in the accident. The car crash in Freiburg. No, honey. I'm sorry. That's not what happened. Your parents were murdered. What? What are you talking about? Nobody ever told me this. What are you saying? Your mother dared to fight a very powerful black witch: Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of Sighs. The Mother of Sighs. Father Johannes. - How many drops? - Twenty, please. You look exhausted. You need to rest. With everything that's going on now? I have to fight. - I have to fight! - Stay calm now. Please. Take your drops. Your weakness is your strength, Father. I've been expecting you. - You're Sarah. - Yes. Hi. There's a lot I have to tell you-about your mother... about you, and about a world- you hardly know. More than a thousand years ago... witchcraft was birthed... by the shores of the Black Sea by three sisters. For years they roamed the earth... bringing death and destruction wherever they went. Search any art history book and you'll find images of them. Eventually, they found homes. Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of Sighs, settled in Freiburg. The Mother of Pain, Mater Tenebrarum, went to New York. Mater Lacrimarum came to Rome. She's known as the Mother of Tears. She's the most cruel and beautiful of the three. And she's the only one still alive. Mater Tenebrarum and Mater Suspiriorum... died many years ago. The Mother of Sighs. She murdered my parents. Yes. But not before your mother... had injured her horribly. After fighting your mother, she was reduced to a shell of her former self. A young dancer named Suzy Bannion... finally managed to kill her. But that's all history. When that urn Brusca found was opened... it restored the Mother of Tears's powers. How do you know about that? Your friend, Michael, told me about it... when he phoned and spoke of a magic red tunic... that would be a great and powerful talisman. I've had visions. Witches are coming... from all over the world to celebrate her return. Yes. They're arriving in Rome every day. Every jet, every car... every train brings more. They aim to make Rome fall again... to usher in the Second Age of Witches. I can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy. There's nothing wrong with your mind, Sarah. It's the world that's gone crazy. Have a look. Look at this. Usually I have one exorcism request a month... but the last few days, I've had more cases than I've had in my whole life. - Every priest I talk to is faced with the same challenge. Why is all this happening? The Mother of Tears spreads evil wherever she can. Some she kills, others she drives mad. She revels in chaos and human despair. We have work to do. I have a book in my study that shows us the way. Valeria! Valeria! Valeria. Valeria. Requiescat! Father Johannes! - Mother? - Marta, come back! Come back! Mother, I obeyed you! Come on, let's go! Let me- Somebody help- Marta! Marta, help me! Oh, my God! Marta! Marta, let's go! - Where's your car? - It's right there. They're coming! Oh, God, run! It's locked! Open- Open up! - Open it! - I can't find my key! Why were they all after me? Your mother. - What are you doing? - I'm calling Michael. Are you crazy? They can trace you with it. You're right. Fuck it. Come to my place tonight. It'll be safer for you. No, I'd rather go home. Michael can reach me there. Mmm. Here's my phone number and address. - Call me anytime. It's no bother. - Thank you. You're Elisa's daughter. That's closer than family. I don't mean to scare you, but... they know who you are, Sarah. Promise me you won't trust anyone. I promise. What's going on here? They are burning the churches. It's getting worse. Mater! Mater! There was somebody at my apartment! I saw lights and shadows under the door. I feel like I'm going crazy! God! Help. Please help me. Help me, please. Take a deep breath. - Thank you. - Calm down. Come in. - Elga, meet Sarah. - Hi. - What is she doing here? - It's okay. Marta, you have to help me. I don't know what's happening to me. - Come with me. - You have to explain. Why is all this happening to me? Why? They know who you are. They can't take any chances. But l- l- I don't know anything. You know more than you think you do. How else have you survived this long with those monsters after you? Elga, would you please excuse us for a minute? Oh, please. Come on. Please? You have gifts, Sarah. You need to accept that if you want to survive. Watch and learn. drifting spirits. They are everywhere, especially here in Rome. The old houses are full of ghosts. Think about it. The city is 2700 years old... and we are standing on five layers of graves. - How do you do it? - You can do it too. With your gifts, you can see what others can't. Close your eyes. Focus all of your energy... and concentrate on this spot. Good. Now just do like I did and blow. Sarah. No, it can't be. Mommy? Sarah. Ohh. - Mommy! - You can't touch her or she'll disappear. Leave me alone. Mater Lacrimarum grows stronger. She grows stronger, Sarah! Where-Where are you? Mommy! Mommy! You're in great danger, my dear child. - Learn to fight. - No! No! No! Don't go, Mommy! Don't leave me! Mommy, please! Mommy! Please make her come back. Please! Mo- Don't leave me. Don't leave. She told me to fight. You have to help me. I have to fight. Please. I'm only a psychic. I can communicate with spirits, but that's about it. I don't have your mother's gifts, or yours. You need someone who can guide you, point you in the right direction. Yes. Tomorrow I'll introduce you to Guglielmo de Witt. - He's a great Belgian thinker. - Okay. He'll tell you something useful, if it's not too late. Thank you. Thank you. No. No. Pick up the phone. Come on, Marta, pick up the phone! Hello? Hello, Marta? Marta, you have to get out of there now! Marta? Hello? Who's there? Run! It's too late! Now! Run now! No! She doesn't know anything! No! don't do it! don't do it! Mater! Mater! Where is Sarah? She isn't here. Idiot! It is you. It is. Stay strong. Stay strong! - Mom. - Stay strong, Sarah! Yes. Mom, what did they do to you and Dad when- Shh. It's all in the past. There's nothing you can do. It was meant to be. I was so upset, so angry at you for leaving me. Plea- Please don't abandon me again. Forgive me, little Sarah. I can't speak anymore. I belong to another place now. Use your gifts. Use them. Use them. Mommy. Okay, guys, listen up. We're looking for a girl around 28. Her name is Sarah Mandy. If you see her, don't approach her. Michael? Michael. Mi- Michael! Michael! Michael, stop! Michael? Michael. Are you okay? Michael, you're sick. Where's Paul? I thought- did you- I think- I think he's - I think he's dead. - Oh, my God. - They killed him. - Oh, my God. - And I can't - I don't want to talk about that now. Let's go. My apartment is not safe. - Everywhere I go, they- - We'll go to my place. They won't look for you there. No, no. No lights. Why? We don't want them to see us. I'm so happy we found each other. Are you okay? - Why don't you just rest, take off your coat- - No, no, no. I'm freezing. Sorry. I'm freezing. I just haven't spent a- a single night inside. - I looked everywhere for him. - Yeah, what happened? - Because I went to Monteleone to find you. - I couldn't get there. They were following me. Everything you were trying to tell me I understand now. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I'm really sorry. Okay. Maybe you shouldn't smoke. Why don't you- do you want me to fix something? Tea, maybe? No. No, I'm f- I'm fine. I'm just- I'm just pleased I found you again. I'm fine. don't worry. Fine. Michael, you're bleeding! - It's nothing. - Michael, you're hurt! No, it's - it's okay. It's nothing. What do you mean, it's nothing? You're hurt! I told you it's nothing! Get off me! I told you to get the fuck off me! Do you think they would spare me and my child? You're so naive. You can't escape her. But they killed your son! Your mother can't help you anymore. We all have one mother now. The Mother of Tears. You bitch! Oh, you crazy- you crazy bitch! Guglielmo. The name Marta gave you. Find him. Mommy! Sarah! Welcome back to the morning news. And now for today's top story. They're calling it the second fall of Rome. Over the past few days the city has witnessed hundreds of acts of violence. detective Marchi, you say that they are all connected? Uh, yes. Everything started with events at the Art Museum of Rome. The brutal murder of the assistant curator, Giselle Mares. But how does that all tie together? It was the trigger for everything that's happening now. We ask everybody to be on the lookout for this girl, Sarah Mandy... the only witness to events at the museum. - If you see her- - Is she a suspect? If you see her, do not approach her. Call the police and ask to speak to Homicide. Shit! - Fuck you! - Oh, no, fuck you! - Give me my money! - What are you talking about? Give me your car. Give me your car! Sunglasses! No! No! No! Hello? Yes, can I please have the address for Mr. Guglielmo de Witt? d-E-W-l-double T. - Yes? - I need to see Guglielmo de Witt. And you are? My name won't mean anything to him. All right. Come in. So, you wanted to see me? Please sit down. As you can see, l- I'm not very mobile. I'm here because l- I have to ask you about- We alchemists may practice an ancient art... but we do watch the news. do you think I wouldn't know who you are, Sarah Mandy? And that the police is looking for you because you're wanted for murder? Another thing about us alchemists- we're not all one thing or another. After all, good magic is good, and black magic is- Well, it's good too. Some of what we do is magic, science... esoterism, theosophy, natural law. A little of this and a little of that. This will let me know who you really are... and what you've really seen. Hmm. Interesting. I see you have latent powers. Instinct more than anything else. Marta Colussi sent you, I see. So did your mother, Elisa Mandy. What did you do to me? Huh? did you expect me to just let you waltz in here without making sure who you are? Now, why exactly did you come here? I need to find the Mother of Tears. - Why? - Look what's happening to the city. Rome is falling apart. She has to be stopped. Mmm. What do you think you can do? Kill her? Well, my mother was very powerful... and I think I might have the same gifts. Which you found out about when? Yesterday? I don't know. There's got to be some people that can help, people like my mother. Father Johannes said that- that Mater Lacrimarum is bringing on the Second Age of Witches. Mmm. Father Johannes was right. Somewhere in the city the celebration has already begun. But I'm afraid there is no army of good witches out there to come to the rescue. If you want to stop her, you have to do it yourself. So I'm on my own now? I didn't say I wouldn't help. I can't give you answers, but I can share information. Follow me. Centuries ago, a great Roman alchemist named Varelli... lived for a time in this villa. He was also a gifted architect. And near the end of his life, he built the residences for the Three Mothers. This may tell you something you need to know. The Three Mothers. I don't know how much it will cost me... to break what we alchemists have always called SILENTIUM. I met the three Mothers... and built three houses for them: one in Freiburg, one in New York... and one in Rome. I discovered too late that these houses hide obscene secrets. It is from here that the sisters spread pain... tears and darkness throughout the world. This building should be the one Varelli built in Rome. "What you see... "does not exist... and what you cannot see is truth. " It's a riddle. Find where Mater Lacrimarum resides... and you'll find the answer. Are you sure you want to do this? do I have a choice? Mater. Mater. Mater. Mater. Stop. Stop right here! Hey! Who are you? I, uh- I just saw some women come in. - did you see them? - No. - You here to interview me? - Yeah. Here. How long you've been living here? Shh-A long time. Thirty, forty years. Since the Nazis escaped at the end of the war. And who used to live here before you? Oh, I don't know. A kind of association. Philosophers. Artists maybe. I don't remember. Why did they leave? Maybe because when the Nazis occupied the villa... they tortured and killed a lot of people down here. Hey! You won't report me, will ya? Shh, shh. Easy. - Where did she go? - I think she's gone. I'll check upstairs. - Stay here. - Yeah. - She's not there! - Then she's gone. Everything's okay. You forgot what we were supposed to do, didn't you? - No. - No? Inform them every time somebody comes to look around! - Understand? - Yes! - Yes. - Move! - Where did they go? They just- - Shh. They're in here. I can feel it. "What you see does not exist... and what you cannot see is truth. " The secret of the house. Those are the same symbols I saw on the urn. Catacombs. These are unexplored catacombs. Oh, my God. This is the home of the Mother of Tears... and her followers. Dear God. Witches. Witches? What are you talking about? You'll see. Stay behind me. The three Graces. What are you doing down here? I'm an art historian. I just wanted to see- Come with us. I'll let you see something. We'll show you! Yeah! We'll show you! Come on! Mother, give us power! Burn it all! I will! I will! I will! Mater! Mater! - Mater! - Mater! Look, Mother! An intruder! Wait! Get him! We'll eat you alive! Hang him! Our hour... is coming! Hello, Sarah. Come here. Who wants to eat the girl? Me. We have waited for this moment... for one thousand years! Our power is here! No one can stop us now! No one! No! - Damn you! - It's an earthquake! No! No! Sarah! Shh! Shh! It's me, it's me! It's me! It's me! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Enzo. Enzo! Go. Go! Go! Mother.
