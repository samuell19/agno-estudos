For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Happy Birthday to you... Happy birthday dear Anna, happy birthday to you. Make a wish. Shit. Hello, Karsten Böhm here. 58 Lenne Street. I need an ambulance. You don't have to go along. We reached her husband. Anna came with Caro. Caro is a friend of Judith's. Judith is the girlfriend of my colleague Florian. I didn't know Anna. We partied. Everyone left around three o'clock. Except Anna. She stayed. She looked sad. She told me it was her birthday. We had a shot to celebrate. And all of a sudden... she had trouble breathing. She was feeling hot and dizzy. At first I thought it was the alcohol And made nothing of it. But it got worse. Why didn't you call emergency immediately? My first thought was the clinic because... It's close to my place. I go past it every day. Maybe I thought... intuitively it would be faster. How was I to know it was closed? Interesting. Even a child would have called emergency right away, no? Yes. Sure. In retrospect I'd say the same thing, but... I'd been drinking, too. It happened so fast... I have no idea why I did what. How long did it take you to get to the clinic and back? Ten minutes. Fifteen, tops. Did you have sexual intercourse? No. I live with my girlfriend. - But she wasn't home. - She's on a business trip. Had you quarrelled, had there been a dispute? I already told you I didn't know Anna. You don't need to know someone to have a fight... No such thing happened. So the bruise on her arm has nothing to do with you, right? What bruise? I need to lie down. What happened? Leave him be. I spoke to your father on the phone. You were gone for ten to fifteen minutes. The autopsy report will be decisive. It will tell us whether, in this time span, the life of the deceased could have been saved. You might be investigated for failing to give assistance or manslaughter. But we're not there yet. But Karsten did actually help. He went to the clinic. It wasn't his fault it was closed. If it had been open and he'd returned in time with a doctor... it would have been genuine assistance. In the end, he didn't call emergency in the first ten minutes. That's a simple fact. But under stress people can have unexpected reactions. The main factor in this case is what Mrs. Kowaljow's family will do. Since we spoke last I've gathered some information about them. Anna Kowaljow: 29 years old, married for seven years... to Andrej Kowaljow, who works in the factory here. They have a five-year-old daughter. What? Kowaljow has a child? Yes. They are Russian Germans who moved here. My God. I see. What do you see? Who knows what her intentions were? Maybe it was a blessing in disguise. Dad, come off it, please. Mr Reiss... I, my son, my father were born here and grew up here. Neither I nor my family has ever been in trouble with the law. We are honourable citizens, we have always done our duty. Your father-in-law knows our family very well. You see? I do. Don't worry. There are currently no investigative proceedings against Karsten. Let's wait and see. But above all it was a mistake to have talked to the police. You should have asked for a lawyer at once. Please speak to no one about that night from now on. Just try to go about your life... as if none of this had happened. I still can't believe it. We'll take the rings. I'll do that. I've got it. - I'd be glad to help. - It's faster if I do it. I'll bring the plates then. Yes. Top left when you come in. That smells delicious. - Thanks. - My pleasure. Not for me, thanks. I made them for you. You like them. Go on, try one. - Thanks. - My pleasure. Well... - Cheers. - Cheers. Bon appétit. - Bon appétit. - Bon appétit. - Delicious. - I'm glad. Why are you sitting in the dark? It is nice like this. - Should I get the lights? - Nope. Unless you want to, of course. How do you feel? Shitty. What did you talk about with your father? Tell me. Come on, tell me. What if your parents come in? Wait. Wait. Sorry. It's all right. - How are you? - So-so. - I'm sorry about what happened. - Thanks. I can't believe it. She seemed fine as we were there. - She did, right? - Yes. I can't believe it, either. Will you be all right? - Well, quite all right. - Yes? Say... Judith and Caro, where did they know Anna from? Judith didn't know her. - What? - Yes. Why? I thought... It was Caro who brought Anna. I thought they all knew each other. I don't know... We heard. I'm so sorry. Thanks. - You okay? - More or less. Thanks. Florian said she was very young. Yes, right. I don't get it. How can someone just die at that age? I've no idea. Was she ill? Maybe. Caro, it's Karsten again. Call me when you get this. Thanks. Thank you, Mr Krilger. - I'll finish the carpet now. - Great. But I'll do the windows on Wednesday. Okay. I found these pantyhose in the cupboard while tidying. But they're not mine. I know they're not yours. I thought you might know where they come from. I found them after that night in the living room. I put them in the cupboard because I thought... They must be Anna's. Right? Who else's might they be? Why did you put them away? I don't get it. I didn't want... the police to find them. Yes, I... Why shouldn't the police find the pantyhose? Because it's obvious what they would have thought. If they'd seen them... I thought they might... misunderstand. They might think that I'd taken them off. I didn't want to throw them away in case someone might... need them. Did you take off her pantyhose? No. I didn't take... What do we do with them now? I'll just throw them away. Okay. Hi! How are you? I got a call from the police. They want to speak with me again. I've no idea why. I told them I'd already said all I know in my statement, but... ls there anything I should be careful about? No. Why? What might there be? I don't know, that's why I'm asking. You think I'm concealing something? Not at all. - You think you have to cover me? - I'm just asking! Just tell them the truth, Stephan. What's the problem? - There isn't any problem. - So? I was just asking if there's something I should know. I don't want to get you in trouble by mistake. Why are you so uptight? I'm not uptight. Hello. How are you? - Fine. You? - Fine. - Hi, Caro. - Hello. Yummy. - Is Judith inside? - In the kitchen. Okay. Hey Caro! - How are things? - Fine. With you? Fine. I've been trying to reach you. Your cell was off. I was at my aunt's in the country. I see. I just got back. I heard... I'm really sorry. Thank you. I wanted to ask you... - Will you have a glass of wine? - Yes. Me too. Caro! - Did you like the uphill walk? - No! Are you okay? I just ran into Juliane. You know she always argues with her boss. - Yes, yes. - Yes. And... she told me... that a friend of hers is a Facebook friend of this famous boss. - Wine? - Yes. He posted a photo of them on the beach. Juliane took the photo... and put a huge smiley on the boss' big belly. I know. She drew a big smiley on his belly... and sent it to her husband. But instead of sending to her husband, she accidentally sent it to her boss. - No! - Impossible. Pretend it's funny. - Was she fired? - No. I'd have fired her. Come off it. Her subconscious sent it. Cause he's a pain. Totally. - The trout aren't ready. - I only want peppers. I'll get the tomatoes. I'll get something, too. Looks good. - How was it in the country? - Fine. Say, Anna and you... how did you get to know each other? I didn't want to bring this up and upset you. But I have to tell it now. Wait Caro, stay here. I was called to the police station. They asked me how I know Anna. So? I was very surprised. I didn't know her at all. What? You didn't know her? You told them I brought her. But she didn't come with me. - But you did come together. - No. When I came to your house Friday night... she was in front of the building. Yes? I rang... When no one answered she said to me, they can't hear you. I thought she was also waiting for you to open up. Then I called your mobile. You didn't answer. We were just standing there. I smoked a cigarette. Anna didn't want one. Finally you called me back. When the door opened we walked in together and went upstairs. That's how it was. I didn't know Anna. So none of us knew Anna? So it seems. - So it seems! - Yes. Didn't you ask her how she knows us? No. I didn't. But I introduced myself to her. You must have noticed. - No. - How come? Even if you thought she was a friend of mine... It's normal, asking where do you know each other from! Had you ever seen her with me and Laura? No, but she might have been a colleague. You might at least have asked me. You bring someone in who no one knows at all. - Sorry. - You find someone on the street. Sorry. I made a mistake. It wasn't on purpose. Great. I was already drunk when I arrived. We were all drunk, Caro! Okay. She didn't die because you brought her. That's true. But she might not have died at ours. Karsten could have also asked who she was. - When? - Why Karsten? - I had no opportunity. - You could have asked yourselves. - Guys! - When Karsten had the chance, she suddenly fell ill. - Isn't it? - Yes! What happened, happened. Okay? It's like this... a stranger came round. She might have been a thief. Is nothing missing? No. If she'd planned that, she'd have taken what she wanted and left. To my mind... she didn't want to leave. Maybe she was on the run from someone. I made a video that night. Want to see it'? - They're getting married. - We're getting married! I'm getting married, too! Don't put it on Facebook! That's mad. I can't remember that at all. We were really drunk. No clue. I only remember one thing. She looked sad. To me, she was someone... who had a problem. I didn't tell anyone, but... I'm afraid she might have committed suicide. What do you mean by that? I've no idea... We talked about it just before. She was on the balcony. I thought she was going to jump. I asked her if she was suicidal. A moment later she was ill. It's weird, right? She didn't seem suicidal to me at all. But I didn't talk to her for long. What did you talk about? Nothing, really. Just hi... But... she looked healthy and happy. It's funny that all the men remember what she looked like. Karsten, you have to tell the police. Yes. You shouldn't have kept it secret. What? It wasn't a secret. I just didn't remember. At the time, I thought it was small talk, that's all. You reap what you sow. What do you want, Judith? I wonder what a married woman was doing alone with a stranger. It's unbelievable how mean women can be about each other. Should we respect her just because she's dead? Do you think I didn't see? Of course you saw it. You were flirting with her from the beginning. And when we left, she was the only one who stayed. Do you think I didn't see? - Sure. - Great. It's well known that women see better than men. Women even see things that don't exist. You're denying it? There's nothing to deny, Judith. What is it you claim to have seen? Go get Laura and the three of us can discuss it. Your relationship and what Laura thinks doesn't interest me. I just think cheating is disgusting. And I believe you're lying like a champion. Fuck you. Why didn't you tell me about her jumping? I already told you, I forgot about it. But I tell you everything, even if I forgot it. How do you remember things you forgot? Come on! Have I ever concealed anything from you? You know how it came across today? Everyone thought you're hiding something from me. - I felt like an idiot. - Laura please. No such thing happened. She was wearing the pantyhose. I saw it on the video. She was wearing the pantyhose from your drawers. Then at least we know they were hers. It means she was wearing the pantyhose in the beginning. She took them off after everyone left, right? I know what you're thinking. I didn't sleep with her, Laura. It wasn't right they reported that you work here. Shit... I've no idea how it happened. I didn't speak to anyone apart from the police. Listen, Mr Böhm. All the customers you know will want to talk to you about it. I can imagine it will be unpleasant for you. I've given it some thought and here's my suggestion: It might be better if you and Mr Krilger exchange places till it blows over. Let him take care of the customers. And you... can take care of your business in the background. We'll talk things through later. - Hello. - Hi. I cleared everything out. I saw. It's totally unnecessary. It's just temporary. I hope I don't have to come back down here. You have it real nice up there. There's a lot on today. Could you bring me these up when you're done? See you soon. Hello, Laura, it's me. I just got home. I ate out. You don't seem to eat in, either. Call me back when you get this. Bye. Aren't you asleep? I was worried about you. You didn't return my call. My battery was dead. There's always a way to call if one wants to. If one wants to... You think I didn't call you on purpose? Well... Did you? I was with Judith, I lost track of time. Say, has the carpet vanished? Or am I too drunk to see it? No, I put it away. - You put it away? - Yes, it's in the closet. Why? I couldn't bear to see it anymore. That's good. Are you punishing me now? Do I have reason to do so? I can tell you're looking for one. You mean the newspaper? There you go. Nonsense. Of course the paper upset me, I won't lie to you. When you talk to me like that I start doubting myself. I get to thinking I'm crazy not to make a scene. Anyone would. Was it Judith who gave you that idea? Can't I have ideas of my own? Can't you see things from my point of view? God! - You know I'm really in shit? - Why must you be so dramatic? I asked you to come because I wanted to speak to you in person. I received this yesterday from the police. Karsten is being asked to come in, this time not as a witness, but as a suspect... What? Actually it's not so bad, now I can get access to files. So, we'll know the result of the autopsy. And then, I'll try to reach a settlement with Anna's family. If they accept, I can negotiate with the prosecution... and have the case dropped. Be careful with these people. If they get an angle, they'll use it for all it's worth. I'm hopeful we'll be able to agree on an amount. - You found nothing against them? - No. I don't want to go back there... I don't want to go to the police again. No, no... No, I want you to use your right not to testify. - I've arranged it. - Perfect. Arranged what? Mr Reiss had the good idea of us both attending the opening of the Adventure Lift together. I've arranged it all. We are getting bad press. We have to get you out of the line of fire. Laura! Bye! Bye. What do you think? How long will you stay at Judith's? To be honest... I don't want to return to the apartment. I can ask the real estate agent to find us... something new. We clear out the old apartment quickly and... I can't look for a new apartment right now. I can't. You don't need to. I'll take care of it. - You only have to... - I don't want to. Please. There's no way. Probably you wanted to leave me and here's your pretext. You've no idea of the pressure I'm also under. How people watch me... I can't just go home and act like nothing happened. Everything is... very clear. You're dumping me, right? Now that I need you. I really can't believe it! It's unthinkable! What gives you that idea? Have you gone crazy? Have you gone crazy or what? The municipality and I are proud of this new attraction, and I'm sure everyone in the city will benefit from this new achievement. It's thanks to the support of the Cultural Foundation and the many donations of the people of Altena that we could build this lift. My thanks to you all. I invite Mr Böhm to join me as representative of the donors. The Adventure Lift would not have been possible without your generosity! Thank you. Thank you, Mr Mayor. Ladies and gentlemen, as you all know, my family has supported the town of Altena for generations. We consider it our self-evident duty to the town. I would like to mention that it was my son Karsten... my son Karsten who gave me the idea of contributing to the financing of the Adventure Lift. Yes, I wish us all a good ride. Thank you. "Our clinic has only ever been open during the day. It's been closed at night the past five years. Please take note." Why didn't I just call an ambulance? I'm so stupid. - I'm so stupid, so stupid... - You're not stupid. Stop it already. This is all my fault. Karsten, it's not your fault. Don't make yourself believe in this. You did nothing wrong. Unbelievable. You don't give a shit whether I'm guilty or not. You're only thinking of yourself. Egoist! That's enough! Now tell us, why did you run around like a madman? - What were you thinking? - Karin! No, let him speak. I want to understand what was going through his head. Why were you running to and fro? Yes, that's right, I... I didn't call for an ambulance. I was afraid. I ran away. You know what I first thought when I saw Anna lying there? No-one should find out about this! Karsten, the perfect son, mustn't make waves. I wanted to settle this without hoo-ha. Nice and quietly. You get me? Know what the worst thing is? That I'm just like you. I'm one of you. Anna's family doesn't want to negotiate with us. They're not interested in money. What interests them, then? They might want to go to court to prove to the general public that Anna had done nothing wrong. Which means? That you'll be summoned to testify in court. What? There's no cause to be afraid. - You're not serious? - It's not a jail sentence. Holy shit! Mrs Kowaljow was asthmatic. She died of cardiac arrhythmia and respiratory failure. It was caused by her medication interacting with alcohol. You see? This document indicates that the coroner's report will be decisive. It'll inform us if the victim could have been saved in the first 15 minutes. But I mean... I didn't even know Anna had asthma. It's not as bad as it seems. You're always saying the same thing! How could it be worse? If you are convicted, you'll only be fined. Yet I'd still have been found guilty! Calm down. Wait until the trial. Karsten, hi. Karsten, Karsten. Professor Schneider, please step forward. We are keen to hear your report. The results of our blood test indicate that Anna Kowaljow had consumed no narcotics. Her death involved the effects of alcohol, the asthma she suffered from, and ensuing cardiac arrhythmia. This arrhythmia is a side effect of the asthma drug Bambuterol that was found in her blood. Furthermore, there is no indication of rape or consensual intercourse. It cannot be excluded, however, if a condom was used. The bruise seen on Mrs Kowaljow's left arm dates to at least 24 hours prior to her death. Do you think that the death of the deceased... might have been prevented or significantly delayed... by timely medical intervention? I can give no assurances she would have survived with a punctual paramed's help. Cardiac massage might have saved her, but... it's not certain. Thank you, Professor Schneider. You can return to your seat. Your honour, Mrs Sergeyevic would like to be heard. Go ahead. I want to stand. I have lost my daughter. Do you have children? Do you know what it means... to lose a child? It is the worst thing... that can happen. I can't understand why someone runs outside... and doesn't seek aid if someone needs it... as my daughter did. If it were someone without education like me... I'd have understood. But... You? You could have helped my daughter. Why didn't you call an ambulance? Why didn't he help my daughter? I don't understand it. I leave the decision... to your conscience. There shall be a fifteen minute interval. The court is adjourned. It will reconvene... in this court room on Wednesday at 9 am. Go screw yourselves! Assholes! What? Wake up. What are you doing here? You can't just... Everyone's looking for you. Hi, Stephan here. I found him. Where I thought. Don't worry, he's fine. Hold on. Your father. Yes? I'm okay. No, I forgot my mobile at home. What's that you say? Why? What does the lawyer say? Okay. Yes, yes, I'll be there. See you. Andrey Kowaljow dropped the charges. That's why we're looking for you. It's weird, right? What's wrong with you? Why would he do that? Feel free to be pleased. The trial will continue anyway. Yes, but... If I'd called an end to the evening... she might still be alive. I don't know... Fate gets us all in the end, anyway. Since when do you believe in fate? Well... if it helps? What would you have done in my position? Everyone has gone... you're alone with her... She looked at me a few times, too! Don't always be so hard on yourself. What did I do to deserve this? Why am I being punished like this? Being punished for one's weaknesses? I don't believe in that. Come on. "After the game is before the game." Hello. I came to see you for... I understand if you don't want to let me in... I... I want to know why you dropped charges. I didn't know Anna was from Russia. You couldn't tell from her accent. Anna worked hard to lose her accent. Her schoolmates made fun of her when she came to Germany. And you... did you come here later? Why? Well... you can tell at once you're not from here. Are you from the immigration office or what? You liked Anna, didn't you? I don't know how... to tell you the truth without hurting you. But on my way here I decided to be honest. Do you believe in God? If God didn't exist, we'd have to invent Him, says Voltaire. I don't know any Voltaire. I'm asking you. Hello? What are you doing? Don't go up there! Come back down. Come on. Please. Come back down. You'll hurt yourself. It's too high for you. If you fall... It's too high. She climbed up there. I wanted to... She wouldn't come down. Come on, maybe she'll bring candy. What did she say? The last thing? She said she wanted to leave here. I was pushed into something. What? From behind. I don't understand. Who pushed you? Anna. What do you mean by that? She didn't tell me she was married. She didn't tell me... she had a child, a family. Not a word. Anna was the most honest person I knew. No matter what. She was so sad that night. Depressed. And... since she didn't tell me about you... I thought she had a fight with her boyfriend. Maybe it got violent. You made this all up. That's how it is. Maybe. But... where were her bruises from, then? I didn't mention it to the police, but... Anna committed suicide that night. What suicide? You're crazy. What are you talking about? Tell me, then... why would she, knowing that she's ill... and taking medication... why would she drink so much alcohol? Why was she at my place on her birthday? On her birthday. With a guy she's never seen in her life. Instead of with you... her husband? She ran away from you, right? Why did you come here? What do you want from me? Did you think I'd fall on my knees before you? That I would thank you? Why did you drop the charges? Nobody just does that, just to do a favour. You lot always need reasons for doing favours. If you'd treated your wife as I treated her, she would never have run away. You asshole. Scumbag. What kind of person are you? Are you going to lecture me about morals? Why didn't you say from the start that Anna had asthma? Why did you wait so long? Until the autopsy revealed it? You let me run into a trap. And then you got scared... and dropped the charges, because you wanted to kill your cuckold image. Right? I did feel sorry for myself. But look at you... At least I'm not as... pathetic as you. You poor fucker. Hello. Karsten! Congratulations. I am happy for you. The girls, too. We all are. Let's celebrate. How about a drink tonight? I don't know... I'm a little surprised. Is this an apology? Listen... I can imagine what you've been through. We haven't seen each other much recently, but I... I don't know if I'll let you off so easily. Karsten. Sorry to interrupt, but duty calls. Can you complete this file, please? Certainly. I'll see you later, okay? Thank you for taking the time. I'm glad you're here. I wanted to see you, anyway. I'm glad that it's all over. Me, too. That's why I'm here. To make it brief: Although you... had no right and there was no necessity to do so, you demoted me, degraded me... And you put a colleague in my place who is very zealous but definitely less qualified than I. - Listen... - The damage I suffered is considerable. - My lawyer recommends I sue. - What? Also, I could go public, talk to the press. The newspapers always love these kind of stories. But I don't want it to come to that. I have a proposition for you. If you accept my offer, I'll forget the matter. I won't succumb to blackmail. No! Lord no, I'm not blackmailing you. I'm giving you a chance. A chance to correct your mistake. You put me on the shelf. Victimised me. You treated me like a criminal although charges weren't even being made against me. Mr Böhm, I just wanted to protect you. You were thinking of the bank's image. Maybe you were right, but it was illegal. So... I would like you to nominate me to the board as branch manager. And it would really calm the team down... if you'd express your pleasure over my innocence. Thank you. Small... But impressive! It looks like my first place, right? That's right. Like it? It's well located. - Things will pull round. - Of course. You still have these old books. I can't throw them away. I left a few at my parents' but most of them are here. - Cheers. - Cheers. I have to clean, anyway. - Thanks for coming. - You're welcome. Now mine, too! - Sorry. - Let it flow. I was a little surprised, though... that you came so quick. You called, I came. Yes, sure... The way we left things at Florian's... I didn't really think you'd come. Yes... Why did you freak out like that? Because it was shitty of you. Yes... But I wonder why... why you care so much about what I do... am up to... and all that. I mean... I'm flattered. It's great. I feel protected. It's what friends do. It's normal. Really? I just think... that you're either putting me down... or you're worshiping me. It's weird. I don't know what you want from me. I want to talk, that's all. Are you trying to put me down? Of course not. I just find it odd that you... you're always on my back. And... I get the feeling you can't forget me. Well, that's really... I'm engaged to Florian, you know that? Florian is a pussy. - He isn't. - He is. - You're talking about my fiancé! - He's a pussy. - He is not a pussy! - He is and you know it. You deserve better. - Why are you interfering? - I'm not. He's the best that ever happened to me. It's what friends do. And you'd know what's best for me? I think so. And what would that be, in your opinion? Think it through. You can't get me out of your head, right? Isn't it true? I'm right. No? You're such an asshole. Judith, wait. Stop it. Come on. Tell me. Tell me, what do you want? What do you want? Sleep with me. - Louder. - Sleep with me. - Louder! - Sleep with me. - Louder! - Sleep with me. - Louder! - Fuck me! Fuck me! Take your time. Sleep with me. - Louder. - Sleep with me. - Louder! - Sleep with me. Again? Come on. Fuck me! You made Laura do it, right? You got her to leave me. I don't want much from you, Judith. Just talk to Laura. - What's up? - Give me the phone. - No. - Give it to me. - Give it here! - Don't touch me! Have Laura talk to me and I'll delete it... and Florian will never hear of it, I promise. Cross my heart. On my honour.
