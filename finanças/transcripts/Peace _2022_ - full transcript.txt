What is it, Renuka? Ma'am, the patient on bed no. 3 is critical. Please come quickly. You go ahead. I'll come. -Okay. Mr. Vinayan... You're not in a hurry, right? Not at all. There's an emergency. I'll be back soon. Dear Go And Come!! Remove it. There's no point. Teacher, we tried our best. You can inform your relatives. Renu, one minute. Well... her daughter is in the U.S. Only the home nurse is with her now. So, ask Rakesh to shift the body to the mortuary once they settle the bill. And tell them what the procedure is, okay? Okay. And you can give the details of the bill to the home nurse. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. Actually, this is an extreme condition that occurs to aged people. What can be done now, Madam? An artificial testis transplantation will have to be done. There's no possibility to do that in Kerala. You'll have to go out of Kerala. That's alright. I'll refer you to someone. It would be better if you don't delay it in Mr. Dixon's case. There's a hospital in Bangalore. Dr. Sheela who works there, is a good friend of mine. I think that's a good option. Let me see. Dr. Sheela? It's a BPH case. But it's a rare condition. Can you check and tell me? So, Sindhu.. Like I said... It's a little expensive. She said that it might cost around 30 Lakhs. I'll talk to her anyway. It would be better if you go with my recommendation. -Okay? -Okay. So ask Dixon.. .. to take a decision and let me know. Please fill this form. -Rakesh! -Here you go. Hey! That grandpa died. The body has to be taken to the mortuary. Bineesh is on leave today. Damn it! Now I'll have to do it alone. Or, do one thing. Call Gibran. He must be loitering there, smoking a cigarette. Okay. What's up, dude? You've been having it easy since Usha left, huh? Seems like you don't have any work? I'm tired, son. My spine is past its expiry date. I'll mostly end up falling dead here. Why are you working so hard when your back hurts? If you tell Madam, won't she hire someone? Yeah, right! Last time we asked for a salary hike, she said she doesn't have enough to give us. But her Madam has money to build a new hospital though. Damn it! Bineesh is on leave even today. I'll have to do night duty as well. Don't worry, Rajesh. When she starts the new hospital, we'll get work there. Madam will hike our salary too. Yeah. Keep dreaming! Can't you quit this job, sister? Instead of working so hard at this old age? Am I in a situation where I can quit this job? My fate would be to work till I die. What else can I say! If my daughter's wedding gets done, it would've been a relief. Where is your husband? Doesn't he have a job? It's better not to talk about him. Seeing my plight, Madam got him a job in Bangalore. And when he got the salary? Well, he spends it for himself. Let things happen as they come. Where? Why did you tell Carlosettan? Didn't I tell you that I need some time? What time? Just come with me. Ma'am said that it's easier to get a couple visa. That's the only way now. And Papa will definitely find out, some day or the other. You haven't changed a lot, right? Look at your eyes! Didn't they say that there's still time to get the visa? We'll sort this out gradually. There's no point being hasty about this. I'm telling you! No! Ma'am said that she has sent the mail already. Since they don't have direct recruitment, Ma'am is trying other options. This will work out anyway. We just have to go to the agency and arrange the visa after that. I just hope all this happens. It's Carlosettan. Is it? Pick up! Switch on the loudspeaker. Hello! -Hello! -Hello! Yes, Carlosetta. Hey! Have you left from the hospital? Yes. Buy a bottle of rum when you come. Okay. Come quickly. There's scope for a party. Okay then. I'm getting a call from a customer. Okay, okay. Great! When he knows that I'm the groom, he'll break my head with that bottle. You should laugh like this even then. Of course, yes! Haven't I told you earlier itself, to present the matter smoothly when you hang out with my dad? Didn't you shift there to impress my Papa? Now you wait and watch! There will be a performance from him! What? What performance will he do? Only we know what his job is! " Boss, there's an ant in your tea " " This entire town is rusted " " Nerves tied together like a coffee plantation " " It's a ruckus at home Get out of that house " Look! It's Carlosettan! Can you do a wheelie at this height, bro? Yeah! " Open the door of the cage And fly away from here " " Ants... " " Rust... " What is this, man! This is not fair. Sorry, Ikka. There are potholes everywhere. Here you go. Don't repeat this ever again. - Okay. Done! - Get going! " Get going " " Open it " " Fly high " You're trying to get to your grave sooner, huh? You can't be without your stuff, right? I've told you several times, not to interfere in my personal matters. I thought he'll reform himself at least during his old age. When I grew old, he has his own personal matters now. Back in his heyday, I was the only one who mattered to him. Whom do I say this to? What Doing Raji!!!Move Away!! Hey Raji! This is not a beedi or a cigarette. " An eagle in a crow's nest That's a callus of struggle " " Serve this sugary paste all over town " " There's a ledge within the heart " Kerala under the threat of Nipah virus. The disease has been confirmed among 16 people, so far. New findings suggest that the disease spreads from fruit-eating mammals. Sapodilla, guava... Are your dear pet dogs experiencing loneliness? In your busy life, are you finding it difficult to spend time with them or give them a bath? If you reverse the word 'God', you can read it as 'Dog'. I love bow bow! Hey Jomon! You look amazing on TV! But I don't look so amazing. You can go! I've been calling for so long. Can't you answer? I lost my job! Start the car! What Melvin!! Tell the Matter!! I've taken a ticket to my hometown. I want to meet my mother. Hey! You can't go tonight. There's something special today. What's special? Well... We're going to tell Carlosettan about us today. Are you serious? Yes. Then I should definitely leave today. It will be a problem otherwise. No. You needn't go anywhere in this sombre mood. You can have a couple of drinks with them and go. Okay. I'll take the last train for the sake of your true love. But if you tell me during the night that you have a headache and all that, I'll go crazy. Only God knows if it will be a party or a battle there tonight. Hey! If I get beaten by that brutish hand of your dad, I don't know if I can drop you! -Who? Carlosettan? -Yes. He's just a country chicken we're rearing in our cage. -Country chicken? -Yes. He means that your dad needs to get you married, before he can blossom his love. Hey! If he tries to question us, question him about that lady. Got it? Who? Aunt Jalaja? Yes. Aunt Jalaja. Aren't they just good friends? Yeah, right! Friends! Thick friends! [Homely meals] " Jalaja, Jalaja " " Jala Jala Jalaja " " Jalaja, Jalaja " Where's Jalaja? She's over there. Jalaja! Where are you? Hey! My sweetheart is here? Where were you? I had a lot of work today. What's for lunch? I have gas. Come on. Hey! Just acknowledge me, dude. Just come on, Jalaja! What fish do you have? Not fish. There's something else. How's it? I ground black pepper and Tabasco pepper... and made this. But... rice needs some fish curry with it. It's no fun otherwise. At least a dried fish. Shut up and eat. I'm so hungry. Eat quickly. And then let's give a small surprise to the kids. I'm not coming. You go and fix it. Why, Jalaja? Didn't we wait for this day for so long? It's not like that. I feel embarrassed. You're shy? What will the kids think? I'm feeling shy. You're feeling shy? I've brought something to get rid of your shyness. I'll give it. Get lost. Tell me!! What You Are Eating is not Sugar!! Hey Carlos! I am beautiful, right? Tell me. I am beautiful, right? Hey Jalaja! If you were beautiful as well, you'd have reached some other level! Get lost, you... Yes, dear. Hi Papa! Papa... Pa... Has the groom reached? The groom has reached. Where are you, Papa? I am out to make my last delivery. The food is ready, right? Bring it quickly. You should get the food ready. That's your job! Yeah, right. Bring Aunt Jalaja when you come. A mother's post is vacant. I'm trying hard for that, but it's not happening. -You talk to her. -Okay. It's my daughter. Hi dear. Don't say anything else, Aunt. Just come here with Papa. Do you even have to say that? I'll definitely come. The food is ready. We'll come right away. Is it? -Yes. -Then come quickly. Carlos! -Let's go. -Put the necklace. Is it our wedding? Is that necessary? It would have been awesome if you were actually good looking. I'm not joking. So I'm not good looking? Welcome! He's here. Hey! All of you are here, huh? Where is he? Where is my son-in-law? Where is he? This is Jalaja. My friend. Gibran, did you buy booze? Of course. I'll go cut these fruits. We'll get sloshed tonight. I'll go cut these fruits. Go ahead. Move away. Hey! Hey! Where's the groom? Call him. I've been waiting for so long. The groom is sitting here. He is here? Is he in the toilet? Papa! -He is sitting here. -Huh? Say it. Carlosetta... The groom Renu told you about, is me. Huh? Gibran is the groom? That's nice. What's nice? Nice for whom? Hey Gibran! I bought you booze, and you're messing with my family? Huh? What? -Carlosetta, I... -Hey! Hey! I like you. You're a good boy. But forget about this. Papa! Why, Carlosetta? Both of us have decent jobs, right? Then what's the problem? So I should get her married to you? I'm saying this as her father! It won't happen. Got it? Becoming a family member is not like drinking together for fun. Why are you like this, Papa? Carlosetta... -It's not that. -One slap! You and your Carlosettan! It's our Gibran, right? 'Our Gibran'! And look what he did, getting into my house! What did you think? That she'll just come with you? Look at him staring! Gibran! I don't think this wedding will happen unless Papa agrees. That's all. So dad and daughter were just trying to get rid of me smoothly, huh? Yes. Okay. Why? You want to sleep here? Hey! Hey! Wait. Where are you going? Let go of me! Gibran! I won't encourage you. Because... ... you are a fool. Didn't you realize that this dad and daughter are pulling your leg? What? Your wedding was fixed long back. We've come after speaking to your father. He got really scared. If I had scared him anymore, he'd have shat his pants. Well... I knew that you both were just acting. Yeah, right! He knew, it seems. Get lost! Well, I was just going with the flow. Get lost! Isn't that so, Jomon? Get lost! You got scared. Hey! Look at me. You should stop smoking up and be a little more decent. Carlos, you should drop me back. I have to go. You don't have to go. You're not going tonight. Let them hang out over there. We need to discuss some future plans. All of us will have a blast tonight! Hey Gibran! Hey Gibran! Drop me at the railway station. Hey! I have to go to the railway station. Didn't I tell you that I have to go to my hometown? Take an auto rickshaw. I am really drunk. How will I get a rickshaw at this time? Don't play around. My head is splitting. Just go, man! Gibran! Look at this. You need this to go to the toilet in the morning, right? Cigarette! There's none here. You can get it only if you go out now. Come, let's go. Come, let's go. It's almost time. Let's go quickly. Where are you going, son-in-law? Carlosetta, I'll drop him at the railway station and come back. No Carlosettan! Call me Dad! -Dad of the year! -Dad! We will come back soon. You sleep. I will come with you. Okay. Hey Gibran! Why did you call him? Are we going on a picnic? Hey kiddo! Wake up! Wake up! Get up! Come! Get up! Let's go drop him. You sit there. I'll drive. I'll drive the car. You sit at the back. You can't drive. As if this is some Benz car that I can't drive. [humming a song] Son-in-law, you're smoking too much now. I'll reduce it, Dad. Can't find any shop. Just go, man! Stop shouting and ask that man. Try asking him! To him? Hello! Are you going to the railway station? No. He's not. -He's not! -Yeah! I can hear him. Ask him! Okay. Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Get into the car. Don't you know what time it is? Please don't mind, brother. Can you give me one? He doesn't know what he's doing. And that man is not saying anything too. I'm stuck with a bunch of drunkards! I could have gone walking. Thank you. Can you give me one more? I can't get any now. That's why. Here you go. Full packet? -Keep it. It's fine. -Wow. You got it, right? Come and start the car! Don't shout, you pig! I am coming. Don't mind him. What is this? This... You need to keep this. No! I don't need it. Don't say that. Keep this. What is this, man? That would make me happy. Thank you. You're not coming to the railway station, right? You're going to the station, right? Will you drop me on the way? Shall I come along? Why not? Please get in. Let's go. Why are you letting strangers into the car? You don't know what you're doing. Calm down, Melvin! People should care for each other. Shall we go? Rajan! Hey Rajan! Rajan! Didn't you recognize me? -Hey dude! -Huh? Rajan? Rajan! My classmate Rajan! I'm not Rajan, brother. He's not Rajan, it seems. He's not Rajan. Hey son-in-law! Why wouldn't I recognize Rajan? This is my Rajan! Please don't mind him. He's a mess if he's drunk. Is that so? That's nice, son-in-law. I started drinking even before you were born. Don't underestimate my capacity. This is my Rajan. -Rajan! -Yeah, right! Stop it, man! Well, where are you from, brother? What do you do? You didn't tell us your name. I am from Bangalore. Over there, I... I am going home. If you hear my name, you might laugh. That's why. What's your new name, Rajan? Is it too stylish? What's in a name, brother! You can call me Rajan. How can you say that? Can I call Rajan as Rajappettan? What do you do in Bangalore? I work in a pharmaceutical company. Wow! We work in the same field. I am a male nurse. Where do you work? Here, at Wings Hospital. Huh? At Wings? Yes. Rajan! Rajan! Hey! Take this. You'll be lively if you have this. Then you'll understand who Rajan is. Hello! -Take this. -Hey! -Drink it! -My phone! Let me attend the call. Let me talk. Drink this. Carlosetta, give him his phone. Hello! No, it's okay. I am in a car. Rajan is a fraud. You're snatching his phone? I'll forget that you're my father-in-law. I'll kick you out. I'll bring it in the morning. Is it? Then I'll bring it right away. Give me ten minutes. Huh? Okay. Son... Can you drop me back at the place where you picked me? It's urgent. It's been only ten minutes, right? I can't turn around now. He has been wanting to get to the station in ten minutes, for the past one hour. Rajan! We know where to drop you back. We'll drop you. Calm down. Don't say that. Please drop me back urgently. I can pay you whatever money you want. Money? I'll give you five or ten Rupees extra. I'll buy a cigarette packet for you. Drop him after you drop me. So this won't be so easy. I'm used to asking only like this. Turn the car around. That's not how you hold it. Hold it like this. Thank you. Hey! Turn the car around. Hey! It's just a dummy gun. Look at how he's holding it. Give it to me, Rajan. I'll show you how it works. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey Jomon! Hey! Hey! Get the car started. Wash the windscreen. Hey! It's inside. It's inside, right? Wash it with water. Start the car! Start the car! Hey! Do you need water? Hey Melvin! Get into the car! Quick! Come on! Hey! He is still bleeding! You come here! Okay. Hold him. Keep it there. Hold him. Come on. Brother! Why are we taking it now? No one saw it, right? We can leave it somewhere and go! Open the boot, you *****! Wherever we leave him, we'll be caught. Put him inside. Bring his bag. Bring it quickly. Carlosetta, look. He said he works in some pharmaceutical company, right? Put it there. Hey! Where are the clothes? It's inside the car. Hey! Wipe all the blood. And change your clothes. Hey! Another vehicle is coming. Get inside. Bro, if we take this road, can we reach the highway? If we take this road, can we reach the highway? Yes. What happened, bro? Go fast. Wipe the blood. Change your clothes. Get the clothes! I bought this for my dad. It will fit you. Wear it. I had warned you not to let him enter the car. It's all because of the two of you. You keep quiet. What are we running for? What have we done? Let's tell the police everything that happened. They won't hang us if we say that. They might hang us. Hey! We are sloshed. Will anyone believe us? Will they? No. We're also a reason for his death. What do we say? If we say that we gave a lift to a stranger, and he took out his gun and fired it, who will believe it? Does it sound believable? Then what the hell do you want us to do? I can't think of anything. If we abandon this somewhere, won't people come looking for us, from there? It's all because of you! We had to come out to drop you at the railway station! We need to lock this up somewhere. What do we do now? What option do we have? We need to bury this somewhere. We need to bury it in a way that it never comes out. There's no other way out. Not at all. Carlosetta, what all are you saying? What else should I say? You tell me! I am so scared that even my marbles are shivering. God! Oh no! Perfect! Shall I reverse the car? No! No! They have seen us. If we go back, they will chase us and check the boot too. Let's go forward. They won't open the boot. If they open it, we'll fall at their feet. There's no other way. Go! Just act okay. Why were you staggering there? It's nothing, sir. You're reeking of alcohol. So you know the drill, right? Blow. Come on. All of you get down. What is it? They are really drunk, sir. Is it? Then come. Such a nuisance! All of you are sloshed, huh? Get the documents of the car. Suspend his license. Sir! Sir! Sir! Shut up! You want to die, driving while you're drunk? Oh! So you've had an accident on the way, huh? No! I'll get it repaired tomorrow, sir. What is this attire? Are you a folk dancer or what? I'm not a folk dancer, sir. I am Carlos. Car...loss. Nice. That's awesome. Documents. Come on. What are you doing with these boys? He is my son-in-law, sir. Son-in-law? That's nice. Where are you going, at night? Sir, we're going to the railway station. Huh? Tamil? I'm going to Chennai. My house is there. That's why I'm going, sir. What's he doing with you? Well.. They are all together, sir. Where do you stay? At AD colony. Oh! AD colony? Railway station is over there, right? Then why are going this way? To buy cigarettes. Cigarettes? -So late in the night? -Yes. -So far? -Yes. Why are you so restless? We're not restless, sir. Y'all look like you've done something wrong on the way. Nothing. We're just scared. You should be scared. It's good to be scared of the police. Your fear will be over once you spend this night at the police station. Let us go, sir. I will. I caught you to let you go. Once you get sober from all this drinking, you can leave from the station, tomorrow morning. After paying a petty case fine of 10,000 Rupees. We are sober, sir. We became sober the moment we saw you. I can see that. -What's in the boot? -Nothing. Come on then. Get into the jeep. -Sir, please. -Come, get in. Let us go, sir. Don't take us to the station, sir. Sir, we'll do whatever you want. Sir, the documents are all proper. Please, sir. We're poor people. Let us go, sir. Please. Come on. Where are you coming? Hey! Go and ask them. What, sir? Didn't you understand? Ask them. -What is it? -Okay, sir. Hey! Should sir tell you the way to escape himself? Yes. Oh! Yes! Yes! Hey! Take everything you've got. Come on. -Give it. -Take it all. How much do you have? These are all cards. That too, visiting cards. -Sir.. -What is this? A token of love. -You.. -This is all we have. What age are you living in, man? Do one thing. I'll give you a discount. Pay 5000 Rupees and get going. Shall we bring it in the morning, sir? Then let's go to the station. Get into the jeep. Sir, do you have 'Tez'? 'Tez'? Yes, 'Tez'. Google Pay. - Sir. I have it. Take it and send them away. Hey! Send the money. Tell me your number, sir. Got it? I'll give you my number. -Aren't you coming? -Not yet. Checking is still going on. I'll be a little late. Do one thing. Have dinner, lock the door and go to sleep. What about the key? I have the key. Okay. I'll come soon. Got it. Done? Okay then. Get going. And one more thing! Next time we meet, there won't be any discount. -No need, sir. -Get going. -Thank you, sir. -Come. What is this? An untimely rain! -What's the time? -Time... That's enough for today. You can drop me home and go to the station. - You may go. - Okay, sir. You're home? I fell asleep. I had a bad headache. Don't you want food? You go to sleep. I'll take the food myself. Jessie, our neighbour, had come today. What did she say? Why have you installed a CCTV in our house? Who's going to come here? Aren't you a sub-inspector, after all? I've installed all this, because this is a policeman's house. These are bad times. And I am worried about the 30 Lakhs that the doctor has asked for. I have no idea what to do. Honey, shall we sell the house and property then? Shucks. What are you saying? Have your food and come to bed. What is it, Chetta? - Hello! - Hello sir! Hey! You... Didn't you note down those boys' address? Yes, sir. - Hello? Hello sir? Carlosetta! I think someone is following us. Huh? Who? Who is it? Looks like that police officer. Yes, it's him. Him? - It's him. - Yes, it's him. Oh my God! What should I do, Carlosetta? Pull over! Pull over! Act okay! What's up? Did you get cigarettes? Get down. All of you get down. Come on. Get down. You're all wet, huh? And your shirt is all soiled. What were you up to? Nothing, sir. Hey! You open the boot. There's nothing in the boot, sir. I know. Just open it. Come on. There's nothing in the boot. Nothing. There's nothing. Then why should you be scared? Yes. So, the burial is over? You didn't let me know. Where have you buried him? Huh? Oh! At the old tile factory! Come. I need to toss a handful of sand on it. Come, all of you. Get inside. Get in! All of you, get in. Just a minute. You come here. Just come! What is it, sir? I'll tell you. Come! Don't be scared. Sir... Come. Do it. - What? Just pee, man. - No, sir. - Why? You pee has dried up or what? No. So you will pee. Brother... Now tell me what happened. Tell me whatever it is. - Come on. - Sir... It was an accident case, sir. I swear. I swear, sir. And then? We took him into the car to save him. Only you can save us now, sir. - Please, sir. - So... You buried him, to save him! Yes, sir. What story is this, man! Do you take Kerala Police to be fools? - It's the truth, sir. - What? That the police are fools? No, sir. I didn't mean that. We'll make up the rest of the story once we reach there. Hey! This boy has admitted to the crime. Oh no! Sir! Now you can confess once we reach there. Who was driving when the accident happened? - Me. - It was me, sir. I'll make all of you drive! First you ride my bike! Carlos, you drive your car. Come on! Get in. It's all over, Chetta! We'll have to go behind bars now! Gibran has given all the details! Ride without turning back. Don't turn off the headlight. Come out. It's a nice place. Tell me. Where have you buried him? Tell me! It's almost daybreak. Sir... This is the truth. We haven't done anything, sir. I fixed my daughter's wedding with him today. We had a couple of drinks and stepped out happily. We don't even know who he is. It happened unknowingly, sir. He had a gun, sir. When I applied the brake suddenly, it fired. I know that you won't believe whatever we say. But this is what happened. Help us, sir. This is the truth, sir. Now it's a story with guns and bullets, Carlos. - Sir... - What's next? Bombs? - Sir.. - Do one thing. Walk! Come on! Walk, kiddo. Walk! Show me where you buried him. Show me the place. Show me! It's over there, sir. - Come. - Sir! Sir! Sir.. No, sir. Please, sir. Let us go, sir. What is this, Carlos? Move away! Is it right for that poor guy to lie there alone? If it's at some graveyard, he can at least talk to others while lying there. Where is it? Show me! It's over there. So this is the place. What sort of grave is this? Carlos, can't you keep at least a cross here? People will find out if they see that, sir. So this is not your first time. Bring your tools. Why are you silent? Sir, he is a mute. A mute? Then you don't have to go. You go and bring it. GO! Sir, let those boys go. I'll confess to this. Isn't that possible? That's not possible, Carlos. Since this is a team work, all of you will be trapped. Should I dig it? Go and dig it! - Hey! - Yes, sir. Sir, let us go. Let those boys go, sir. I'll go to jail, sir. Sir, I'll do whatever you want. Sir... If you keep scratching like this, it will be morning. Give it to me. I'll dig it out. You must be tired after digging all night. Isn't this his bag? - Yes, it is. - Huh? Yes, yes. I thought I can leave Papa safely with you and go happily. There's still time to get married. Let your father come of age first. We'll think about it after that. Aha! So you're into this whole 'living together' scheme, huh? Your dad also keeps saying this often. - What is this thing, actually - That? You can live together... ... without getting married! Is there something like that? Yes. - That's nice. - Yeah. Awesome! You're a different level altogether, Aunt Jalaja! But I like you. Stop the small talk and check the time, girl. Get going. What's the time? Let me get ready. It's an off-day for him. All of them would be sleeping like dead logs. Go wake them up! I have to go to the shop. Okay. Don't be scared. It was just a dream. Go to sleep. It's Renu. Pick up the phone. She'll come here otherwise. Hello? I just woke up. Yeah, I'll come there. This is the only plan we have in front of us now anyway. Hey! Don't do it, man! I can't be labelled a terrorist and spend my life in jail. This will be a huge problem. If it was marijuana, I could have given it a try. Dude, these are called love pills. Love pills? Is it 'Kulsumbi'? It's a drug that enhances our feelings. There's a huge demand for it. How much will we get for this? I don't know what price it will fetch. From the name he told us, this is all I know. To be frank, this is the first time I'm seeing this thing in my life. Jomon, go and check. It must be them. Why are you getting so scared? Go and check, Jomon! I'll go. Don't show fear on your face. Just act casual. Hey Jomon! Hide that bag. - Didn't you leave yet? - No. Wow! You know how long it has been? What are you guys doing here? What is it? All of you are looking smart & handsome after having a bath, huh? Why aren't you paying attention to me even when I've come to your house? What is this attire? Why are y'all sitting like someone's dead? Huh? Bring it. What's this stuff? This is his bag, sir. We don't know what's in it. - You don't know? - No, sir. Ecstasy!! Its an Terrorist Activity!! So you guys killed him for this? We don't even know what this is, sir. Had we known it, why would we bury it here? Hey! I'm aware of the fraud jobs you're making these boys do. I know what price this would fetch too. - How much? - Sir... We don't know anything about this, sir. I swear. - You don't? - No. Then he will tell you. Come here. Huh! Just come here. Come. You tell me. Tell me. Tell me! Tell me, I say! No, sir. Please don't. Leave me! Let go of me! Didn't I tell you that he can't speak, sir? Didn't we tell you that we didn't do it? Leave me! You scoundrel! You're messing with Dixon? I am a police officer! I'll kill you and bury you! Got it? Sir, we're innocent. Get lost. It pained you when this dumb boy was hurt, huh? I'll show you! - Sir! Sir Sir! - Move away! I'll put him in this pit and... Hey! Look! Even if I bury all of you alive here, no one will ask me anything! No. This is not how I should deal with you guys. Hello? Yes. This is Dixon. You do one thing. Bring 5-6 policemen from the police station to that old tile factory. Come there. I'm going to that spot. - Come quickly. - Sir, please. Don't do this, sir. No, sir. We are innocent, sir. Carlos! Rs.30 Lakhs. Within one week. No more bargaining. Sir, we don't even have Rs.300 with us! Sir, we already gave you everything we had. What is this, sir? We don't have anything, sir. Carlos! Stop your trickery. I know what price this will fetch. You do one thing. Sell this stuff. I don't want anything else. 30 Lakhs! Carlos, you decide! Hey! Where have you reached? You needn't come. I'll solve this myself. Carlos! One week. 30 Lakhs. I'll call you. In the meanwhile, don't try to pull off other tricks. You do one thing. Go give this and fall at his feet. There's no point, Jalaja. But Papa, do you know any details of the dead man? There's no point thinking about him. Well, weren't you calling him 'Rajan'? What if he's actually 'Rajan'? Rajan? Which Rajan? Great! Well... What are you guys going to do? Are you going to flee from the city? No. We have to sell this stuff and get the cash somehow. Hey! You've already been bitten by a snake. Now don't go up on the terrace to be struck by the lightning! Yes. What else can I do with this? Or shall we take your homely meals to the road? We'll sell the meals on the road. And make 30 Lakhs! It will be very easy, right? Can you do it? Hey! My job is not like fooling kids by showing them tablets and random herbs. I do a job that I can take pride in, in front of others. - Jala Jala Jalaja! - Hey you! Can you stop it? You've started as soon as you stayed in a house for 24 hours together? Forget it. Tell me how we're going to deal this. How do we sell this? This won't work. To sell this... I know a guy! - Who? - 'Chemical'. - Yes. - Who's that? Chemical Shacky. He holds me in high regard. But I don't like him. But that's okay. We'll catch hold of him. If we tell him, he can deal with this. Boss, can you pass the pepper? Bro, where is 'Chemical'? Boss! Two dealers are here to meet you. Shall I call them? Hey! Look who's here! Long time! Come on! Come, sit down. Who are they? Are they your bros, bro? This is my son-in-law. Hello. What's up? Please sit down. What's in the bag? What's the matter? You should help us. It's a 'high' matter. That's what I'm here for. Tell me, bro. This is pure stuff, bro. I don't sell such stuff. Bro, if you can't do it, can you connect us to someone? This is a messed up scene, bro. And pills are a whole different deal. It's too risky a job. It's not because I don't have people. But I won't be able to handle it. That's why. Please try once. Please bro. I'll try once. Should we do this? Isn't it too risky? Do you have money? Bro, we're trapped. You should save us somehow. Please help us. Please. - Okay. Let me try contacting him. You don't have to intervene now. So we needn't come? You do one thing. You leave now and come tomorrow evening. 'Chemical' bro. How much money will we get for this? Such pills will cost 1000-1500 Rupees in the market. 1500 Rupees? And... we can't sell this at the market rate. But we can try selling it for 800 Rupees. 800 Rupees? Yes. So we have 5000 pills, right? So it will come around Rs.40 Lakhs. 40 Lakhs? 40 Lakhs? We can get up to 50 Lakhs. 50 Lakhs, Papa? Yes. That's an awesome twist. So after we settle that guy, we can keep the remaining 20 Lakhs! Yes. Did you tell Aunt Jalaja? No, no! Don't tell her. Let us get it first. Even if we get it in hand, we'll have to pay Rs. 10 Lakhs to Chemical. Though it is a disaster, we're going to get Rs. 10 Lakhs. Fate! It's all our fate! What fate? With these 10 Lakhs, will everything that happened be reversed? Will we get 10 Lakhs if all that hadn't happened? He meant that all this happened so that we could get Rs. 10 Lakhs. We'll sort it out. Mr. Sukumaran hasn't arrived? He said that he'll come yesterday. What is it, Madam? Did he create any trouble? No, nothing. You may go, Sarojini. Madam... We're supposed to buy the gold on Monday. I fixed that because you had promised me. Even if I have to slog it out till death, I will repay that debt. We will sort all that out. Okay. And yeah... You should enquire Sukumaran's whereabouts. I want to know where it went. Okay. - Yes, Doctor. - Well... Shouldn't we proceed? There are some treatments before the surgery. I'll do whatever is necessary, Doctor. The thing is that... ... we need to pay the advance a little early. That means, immediately. I'm in a crisis right now. I'll sort it out in a couple of days, Doctor. Okay, Dixon. Okay, Doctor. Who is it, Chetta? Some Sindhu is calling you. Who's that? - Sindhu. - Sindhu? - Hello? - Hello! It's him. Dixon. Switch on the loudspeaker. What's up, boys? Well... what about our deal? Will it be done? We're trying, sir. You should try. You should definitely try. But... there's a date that we agreed upon. You should try before that. - Isn't that right? - Yes. I'll give you a relaxation anyway. That is, you can pay me just 10 Lakhs in two days. Rest, you can pay by the time we agreed upon. Okay? Aren't you happy? Anyway, I will keep calling you to remind you often. But don't end up in any other trouble in between this. I can't do anything then. I'm saying this because you people are dear to me. So, as we said... I'll call you often to remind you. Okay? Don't talk like that, Renu. We'll get the money. What if we don't get it? We'll be screwed if we don't get the money tomorrow. And what's the guarantee that we can be free, once we pay the money? He won't be such a troublemaker. Hi boss! Where's Chemical? What a question! I've been stuck here since morning. And Chemical's phone is switched off. - Switched off? - Yes. Don't feel bad. He must be fixing a deal. Tell me. I don't have the patience to ask you several times, kiddo. Tell me, please. Tell me who gave it to you. I know who gave it to you. Yet, I want to hear it from your mouth. Isn't it Sukumaran? My dear brother, I don't know this Sukumara Kurup you're talking about. This was given to me by a pot pusher called Carlos. And it was the first time he came to us with such a deal. Then you bring him here. Call him and ask him to come here. I don't know where he lives. I just had a phone number. And my phone fell into the lake while you were chasing me. What's happening, Mr. Vinayan? It wasn't him who gave the stuff to them. We got our stuff, right? That's enough. Now don't keep it. Finish it. Finish us? What's this, sister? She didn't mean that. She asked me to let you guys go. - Thank you, sister. - Shut up. Please come, Mr. Vinayan. Chemical... I think Chemical has escaped. Well, we can't say when people will change, right? And since it is Chemical... you know, right? I'm not saying anything. What happened? We're screwed. Chemical is absconding. Don't get bitten by the snakes here. Let's go. This was our last ray of hope. Carlosetta, did you sell it secretly along with that Chemical guy? There was such an option, right? I didn't think of it. You scoundrel son-in-law! Don't mess with your father-in-law. We need another plan at the earliest. Or else, all of us will hang to death. Okay. Let's flee from this state. But we don't have money! Damn it! Why do you need money? We can go in a train without a ticket. You don't need money. Where to? We can go to my home-town, Carlosetta. There won't be any problem there. Yeah, right! As if Kerala Police doesn't have any idea about Tamil Nadu. Even Veerappan was killed by the police, right? Is that so? There's someone whom we can trust. Who's that? Kanjirappalli Jaleel. Who? Kajaji? Who? Your dad? What's that half-wit going to do here? Oh my God! Look who all are here! Carlos, it's been so long since I saw you! Sit down! Is your dog doing good? Melvin, are you doing good? Jameela! Why can't you come home on time? Did I know that they'll come here all of a sudden? As soon as you called, I bought this chicken and came home. I was going to give them rice with chutney. Please wait. Let me fry this. Go ahead! So... how come my son suddenly felt like seeing his parents? Nothing, dad. What's this? Your beard & moustache have grown so much. Didn't you bring your daughter? Jameela keeps saying that we have to meet her. We'll bring her, dad. Let these problems be solved first. What's the problem? If it's about money, you can tell me confidently. I don't have a single penny. Carlos! Were the kids up to some trouble before their wedding? I would've been happy if it was that. What is it then? We're screwed, Kajaji. What is this? The story of a movie? How can you make so much money so quickly? Isn't that why we came here, dad? You know, right? I just have a light & sound shop. Even if I sell that and everything else I have, I don't think your problem will be solved. My dear dad, we don't need money from you. You will have some great fraud ideas, right? That's what we need! It's a terrorist activity. All of us will be behind bars. Give it to her as well. Oh God! Hey! You know so many great stories, right? Give some idea to these boys. Who else can they ask this to? What's the name of that police officer? No, thank you. Dixon. - Dixon! Where does he stay? Near our house. How old is he? Around 40. So he's young, right? He might have small children. Poor guy. But you should beware of 40-year old policemen. They will do whatever they say. Try to escape somehow. You bloody! Loser! What did he say, Melvin? He's saying that we can steal idols from temples. Huh? Idols from temples? He wants to steal idols from temples? That was long back! Now it's not possible. People have all gone crazy now. Back in the day, if Jaleel stole an idol from a temple, it was a theft. Now it's a different issue. Forget an idol. We can't even steal a cow. That's the situation! Thomachan? What is it, Thomachan? Pathrose's mother died. - Oh no! When? - Right now. Which Pathrose? - Our Vattavila Pathrose. - Oh! Come. They need speakers and lights. I need to get a coffin too. What happened, dad? Vattavila Pathrose's mother died. You were here, son? Then you also come along. A coffin has to be taken there. I need to call a couple more people. The coffin is quite heavy. That's fine. There are 3-4 of us. We'll come and help you. Your friends are here too? Then bring them too. Call them. Hey. How old was his mother? Hey! There has been a death. We need to go get a coffin. Finish your food and come. We're as good as dead anyway. Some cries from the house of the dead will make it perfect. Come. The coffin is made of rosewood, coated with brass and gold. It's been six months since I made it. He was waiting for his mother to die, right? I fixed the golden cross only today. This coffin costs around Rs. 5 Lakhs. He never looked after his mother properly while she was alive. But he wants to show off by coating such an expensive coffin with gold. Anyway, you are lucky, Thomachan. Let me survive somehow. Close the shop. - I'm leaving. - Okay. You guys leave. I'll see you there. Okay. Close the door. [Jameela Light & Sound] Hey boys! Come on! The coffin is here. Are you guys thinking what I am thinking? What are these cables for? You bring them! Shall we steal this coffin? Be careful. Think harder! Isn't it risky? Can you make 30 Lakhs without taking risks? [prayers] [Prayer Song Continues] In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen! Oh no! Coffee Has Been Arranged!!! Ah! Go outside and play! Get going! You and your headset! Go! [prayers] Oh God!!! Power Cut!! [People Murmurs] Joby! Joby, switch on the generator! Where are you? [prayers continue] [indistinct chatter] Move aside! Mother Has Gone!! Shall we steal this coffin? Think harder! How much does this coffin cost? Rs. 5 Lakhs. If he can spend 5 Lakhs for a coffin, that boastful idiot will be ready to spend several times that amount, for the person who has to be buried in it. Did you understand? 'Dead body kidnapping' Correct! That plan is okay. - Right? - Yes. But.. isn't it risky? Can you make 30 Lakhs without taking risks? Can we get 30 Lakhs? Ask a fair price, man. If you ask for 30 Lakhs in one go, we'll have to find a ground to bury this corpse in this coffin, ourselves. Isn't he asking for 10 Lakhs now? We'll go give that now and fall at his feet. - That's enough. - That's fair. That's fair enough. Let's ask double the price of this coffin. Rs. 10 Lakhs. That's alright. But there will be so many people. Are we Gods to make the body invisible? We are Gods, indeed. I wasn't able to believe it when I heard it. How can I believe it? In a way, he was asking for this. Do such miracles happen even now? Of course. He made water turn into wine, right? This is so simple for him. Who's this now? - Pathrose! - Yes! This is Jesus Christ speaking. Your mother? She is in my custody now. Oh Jesus! Ask him which parish he's from. His parish! Which parish do you belong to? It's the Pallithazhu parish, Jesus. Will you have Rs. 10 Lakhs cash in hand? Oh no! 10 Lakhs? I don't have that much with me, Jesus. Don't mess with Jesus. I'll rip you apart. You do one thing. Bring Rs. 10 Lakhs... Not to the Church at Pallithazhu... There's a locked Church below that, right? Come there. And you can go after leaving it on top of the donation box. Your mother will reappear on her own in her coffin. Isn't that Church locked, Jesus? I will open it for you, man! Why does Jesus need money? Oh! I have too many expenses! I have to take care of these parents who are dumped like this, right? You come there alone. Kneel down and pray before Jesus to forgive all your sins, before coming. Okay then. I'm hanging up. Jesus! What am I seeing! [praying] Please bring my mother's body back, O Lord! Jesus! Jesus! Forgive this sinner, O Lord! - Pathrose! - Yes! Go back home quickly. Your mother... poor lady... She's sitting on your terrace, okay? Huh? At the terrace? Who is this? A new guy? He's my father, sir. Is this a PTA meeting or what? To bring your father and father-in-law? You know what your son is up to, right? It's lying over there. But it's your good luck that I am in some financial trouble. Thank you so much, sir. Gratitude is nice. Anyway, it's good that your father is here. I'll show you something. Come here. You also have to see this. Come on. How is it? Sir... Sir... They did it unknowingly. They are not people who do such things. Please save them, sir. Didn't I save them? You should save them again. You're quite impressive. Anyway, I trust you all very much now. - Give me the money. - Give it. How much is it? What you asked for, sir. How much did I ask? - 10 Lakhs! - Ha! That's not the amount I asked for. According to the price of the stuff you had with you, this is nothing. - Sir! We didn't make this by selling that. Didn't we tell you? We have nothing to do with it. If you have to arrange so much money in such few days, I have the brains to guess what your business would be. That video will be with me. You can give me the balance amount within a week. - Okay? - Sir... How much more do you need? 20 Lakhs. Sir, we worked really hard to make this much itself. Please help us, sir. Please help us, sir. Carlos... I'll wake up the guy who's in that grave. Sir... So... you will give me the money. Only I have this evidence now. Don't play tricks and make more people ask for shares. - So... one week! - One week! Bye. Sir... Do you want to think once again? Don't make me think again. No. Sir, can you give us a small discount? Carlos! Don't talk too much. One week. Twenty Lakhs! Rs. 20 Lakhs! One week. Isn't that what he said? Isn't that what I am saying? Carlos! We can make that money he asked for, somehow. That's not the matter, Kajaji. He won't stop with this. What if he sends us to jail, even after paying him? No. He won't do all that. I came here with you to analyze all that. He's in need of Rs. 30 Lakhs for something. If you give it, the problem will be solved. Whatever you did, is on his mobile. Don't forget that. There's no other way than paying him the money he asked for, Carlos. What's a way to do that now? The way we took so far. So Pathrose's mother has to die again? Is that the only Pathrose in this town? There are so many Pathroses. If not Pathrose, there will be a Pareekkutty... or a Padmanabhan. Start the car, Carlos. Don't lie down as soon as you got in. Clean this place up. Age should be above 70. Seventy. [AGE - 70] It should be a natural death. Yes. [NATURAL DEATH] Their children should be rich enough so that 10 Lakhs don't matter to them. We should be able to return the body without any damage. What if they say that they don't want the body, if they don't want to pay? Even if we get the money or not, we need to return the body in ten hours. Okay, Sindhu. I'll let you know. Thanks. You Go and Take a look Fast!! They are taking the body somewhere. Where? - To the cemetery? - Hey! Not to the cemetery. Must be for public homage. That's right. That's them. Go away! Go away! Bloody dog! Go away! Hey! What Are You Doing?? Here you go. Give it. - Tell me the number. - 8666 143... ...5511. The person you are calling... This number is blocked. Dial it on the other phone and give it to me. - Is it ringing? - Yes. Switch on the loudspeaker. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello, Mr. Ravi Castella! No. I don't have a caste. Tell me. Just talk to him. - Well... Tell him that his mother is in our custody. Your mother is in our custody. Hello? I can't hear you. - Don't make noise. I'm on the phone. Mr. Ravi Castella, your mother is in our custody now. Are you calling from the medical college? No. Not from the college. Hello! Not from any college or school. Then? We are very dangerous people. We are dead body kidnappers. Understood? If you want this body back... This is a new type of kidnapping, huh? So, if I want my mother's body back, I have to bring the money you ask for, to a place of your choice, right? That's an awesome plan. So you are smart and you know everything. So, just like we demanded, bring the money... Just a minute. Forget about your demands and the money. Listen to me. My mother Susheela... .. was someone who lived really happily. She was totally fine until 10.30 PM, day before yesterday. She was watching TV, singing and dancing with my kids... had dinner, and was doing great. Hey! Hey! Hey! All that doesn't matter to us. My dear kidnap bro, let me finish saying it. Give me 30 seconds. - Huh? - Okay. So what I was saying was that... She died so happily. As per my mother's wish, we completed all the procedures to take the body to the medical college, gave her a bath and sent her away. Who is this guy? I don't have any right over the body now, kidnap bro! It is Government's property now. Try to understand. Well, what do we do now? You come here. Let's have some nice duck curry and Appam at my house and have a good time. Huh? Please come. Well, we... We needn't trouble the police in vain, right? We'll do one thing. We'll go and give this to the medical college. So.. what was it? Castella? Castella. Castella, neither have we called you or spoken to you, okay? Okay then. So, don't you want duck curry? Duck curry... damn it! What just happened? Are we doing a morgue service now? Where do we give this now? Shall we take it to the medical college? What else can we do now? This is screwed. Ravi Castella. No caste. He has a strange name, and a messed up philosophy. We can't dismiss him completely. Though we made a blunder, he's an impressive guy. He has the same wavelength as us. Dad! Only because we're thinking differently like him, are we able to pull off such jobs. Yeah, that's right. Whatever said and done, we should be careful about such blunders now. These are our certificates. Handle them with care. You look so dirty! Can't you take a bath once in a while? What's the point? Here I am scared whether we'll all go to jail! So, shouldn't we apply for the passport? Ma'am is speeding things up. I don't know how we'll go. Let's drop this plan. Don't be upset. What if everything becomes alright? So, go and give it to Ma'am. Let me go and get ready. - Shall we go? - Get going. I have seen you somewhere. He knows you, Ma'am. Jomon works at the dog wash where you take your dog for spa. Oh! Okay, okay! So he's mute, is it? I'm really sorry. I didn't know that. So you must be knowing sign language, Gibran? But he is able to hear us. Okay. So it's an issue with your tongue. Had you taken any treatment? Have you? - No, no. He hasn't. - Okay. Let me just... Show me your tongue. Okay. Let me see. Close it. We can solve this. Just a small surgery on the tongue will do the job. It's a short tongue. Last year, there was a similar case. She has started talking now. And, in my opinion... Don't do it here. I know someone... in Bangalore. Well, Ma'am.. How much will this cost? The surgery is not that expensive. It will cost just 5 Lakhs. Just try. If you arrange the amount for the surgery at the earliest, we can proceed. Okay. And... it will be better to go with my reccommendation. It's like a coconut fell on the head of a guy struck by lightning, and was bitten by a snake after that. Did you find the snake? - Huh? You're high as hell! Madathiparambil Veerankutty has passed away, a few moments back. Madathiparambil Veerankutty. The funeral.... Isn't it our Veerankutty Ikka? Yeah. Yes! I delivered stuff to him even today morning. Is it? He was a regular customer. Now he's gone too. Isn't he like... filthy rich? Don't they own the Madathiparambil theatre? Yes. He's super rich. But he was a naive man. Veerankutty Ikka. Make the call quickly, you idiot! Start the car! We have no time to waste. It's not like others. These guys will keep the corpse inside the house. We need to take it out, hiding it from all those people. Yes. So, we should find a practical way to do it. Or it's risky for us! Yes, it's too risky. If we need to play safe, it should be just the body over there. There will be a crowd, right? So we need to get everyone out of there. What's a way to do that? Stop the car. Stop it! - What is it? - Got it! Got an idea. Come on! What idea did he find in the jungle? Board the next flight and come here. Shanavas! To serve tea and snacks, this is not a wedding. You get here first. I'll handle everything here until then. Okay. Latheef... Peace be unto you. And unto you be peace. I am Veerankka's mother's sister's son. Siddique. Are you handling everything here? Yes. Then come with me. I need to tell you something. What is it? He was having high fever for the past one week. Though he looks like lentil-fruit, he walks around like beans, right? He didn't care much about it. Actually, he was affected by Nipah virus. Nipah? Yes, Nipah. Say it softly. Did you see that? [Guava bitten by a bat.] He ate five or six of them. See this? It's a bat. He got the infection from this bat. Don't tell anyone now. Hey! Just go to the gate... ... and don't let anyone come inside. Go quickly. Hey! There's a small problem. He died due to Nipah, apparently. Get going. The deceased had Nipah apparently. Don't stay here. Get going. Go! Well, son... Shouldn't we inform the Health Department? Yeah. Have to call them. I'll call them. No, Ikka. I know a guy there. I'll call him. It's okay here. We will come later then. Why did everyone leave? They said they will be back soon. The ambulance is here. Huh? I just called them now. It's our Government, right? They are very prompt. But still... how... But how did you get here so quickly? We'll decide whether we have to reach quickly or slowly. Understood? - You are? - Latheef. I am a relative... ... of the deceased. Where's the body? It's inside. Did you touch the body? Yes. Don't worry. Another vehicle will come to take you. Write down the address and phone number. Okay. Write your name and address. Then get into the next vehicle and get going. They are coming. Come. Why did you have to eat those guavas? - Hey.. - Hey! No! Don't touch. Sir, what should be done with the bat? 'Postmortem of the bat is arranged by health organizations' Sir, what? Another vehicle will come to take it. It has to be sent to Pune to be tested. When the vehicle comes, you also get into it and come. To Pune, right? - Attender! - Correct. Well, I'll also go in this vehicle. I'll get down on the way. - Get in. - Thank you so much. Let's go, sir. This SIM is dead. All the potholes in the world are on this road. It's fun to drive only if there are some potholes on the road, right? But the vehicle should be in good condition like this one. Hey Carlos! Are you also dead? Was it an accident? [singing an old Tamil song] Funeral cake, huh? Good! Good! Good! Here you go! I thought you were my buddies in heaven. When I saw this as well, I confirmed it. This was just a block. Temporary death. The problem was that I had some Parotta. Since you gave me CPR at the correct time, I escaped. Didn't you give it? I didn't do anything. I just fell down. So... I will solve your problem. How many Lakhs do you want from him? 10 Lakhs. Is that enough? Is that enough? I'm not saying this because he is my son. He is a miser. Yet, we'll try once. Yours is a genuine issue, after all. Let's ask for 15 Lakhs. What say? But... there's one condition. I need to get one like this, every Friday. Can you get it? Okay. Done! That won't work, Veeraankka. That's not how we work. We don't put a price on people who are alive. Was I alive when you kidnapped me? You brought me back to life, right? Consider it as my donation. Everything he has with him, was made with my sweat and hard work. Then it's fine. - Right, Kajaji? - Yes. Why are you all gaping? Call him! Ask him to bring it to the place I specify. It was a great desire of mine, to know how death feels like. Even that happened now. Can anyone in the world have this experience? Do you have any more of these strange desires? So many! Man's desires are endless! Then tell us one more desire. We'll make it happen. Tell us. You already made my greatest desire happen. Tell us one more. We'll get it done. God! I feel like I am actually in heaven! What happened, Member? No idea, sir. They have escaped with the body. They are asking for Rs. 15 Lakhs as ransom now. 15 Lakhs? They are quite impressive, huh? They said they will burn the body if we don't pay up immediately. Do something quickly, sir. Who are you? The deceased's son. There are rituals for all this, sir. The body has to be bathed, put in a coffin and buried at the mosque. We don't have time to waste, sir. It's a dead body. 15 Lakhs is not an issue. Right, Shanavas? - Yes. - Okay. Don't worry. Arrange the money anyway. We ll get Body without Giving Money Sir... It's him. Switch on the loudspeaker. We have poured petrol over that pyre. Throw the bag to this side of the gate. Or else, he'll go and light it. Them and their funny business. Open the gate! I'll give them the money, sir. Hey! Keep quiet. Sir, it's fully soaked in petrol. No, sir. Shucks! Sir, the body... The body is missing, sir. Start the vehicle! [singing an old Tamil song] So strange, right? We made so much money together for the first time in life, and to think that it will all be gone in a second. This is not a new job you started to make money, right? Try to escape from that policeman with the money you have with you. Come to think of it, he saved you, right? That's correct. Or, the four of you would have been behind bars now. It's a murder case, Papa. Don't forget that. Let these kids go abroad. We can make the money, dude. You calm down. Shouldn't we take a decision about Jomon? We're supposed to pay the money in two days, right? And now we have extra money, right? That's right. - Yeah! Whatever we Do.... Tomorrow... Hey Jomon! Go and give that money to the doctor tomorrow. That money is for you. Shall I ask something? Why should we stop this dead body kidnapping now? We can make a big amount, start a business and get settled, right? Isn't that what I said? Boys, this is an awesome job. We can all get settled in one go. What say? What are you talking about, Papa? We don't need it, Papa. We had a reason for whatever we did so far. That's enough. That purpose is over. Purposes are never going to get over. What did we do? Did we kidnap people, torture them and make money? We're getting them a value after they are dead, which they never got while they were alive. We should continue this, Kajaji. When did I say that we should stop this? Even if you stop it, I will continue doing this. Once a person dies, he belongs to God. The kids who never looked after their parents properly while they were alive; let them spend some money at least when their parents die. That's it. Hey! Tell her. What all are you saying? I think this is a plan that will put us in deep trouble. We'll lose the little peace of mind we have. Yes. This will be a big issue. No issue at all. We haven't left any evidence so far. We aren't going to either. That's what! All the disasters that happened, were for the good! He must have landed in some trouble. He doesn't create any problem now, like earlier. It's only because you've been working here since the time my father was alive, I gave him a job here, despite knowing that he's a troublemaker. He's absconding with very valuable and confidential medicines. And Sukumaran knows what to do with them, very well. If I help you in any way from my side again, won't it be equal to me insulting myself, Sarojini? Madam... There's only a week left for my daughter's wedding. Please don't betray me, Madam. It's not me who betrayed you. It's your husband, right? I know that your daughter's wedding will happen grandly too. If he comes, convey my regards to him. If you can't work hard here anymore, you needn't stay. You can quit if you want to, Sarojini. Just think that we're going to break free from here. Haven't I told you earlier itself, that she has some shady deals. If it's money earned rightfully, will she keep it in the morgue? I don't know what's right or wrong. I have nothing to lose either. My husband has gone his own way. Let's take it. - Rakesh... - Yes. It's been a while since I asked you to find a security guard for the mortuary, right? I had enquired, Madam. I've told a couple of people. One guy said he'll come from next week. Make it fast. And yeah... people will come to receive Kalpana Teacher's body today. You are alone here, right? It's okay, Madam. I'll handle it. Okay then. Didn't you leave yet? No. I'm planning to take leave for two days. So I thought I'll do night duty today. I'll go drop her and come back. Let's go. Okay. See you soon. Rakesh, there are no relatives with the grandpa at the ward tonight. So please help him if he has to go to the toilet. Okay. You carry on. I'll handle it. It's a number lock, sister. 2-8-6-4. That's not the number. 2-8-4-6. That must be right. It's correct. There's so much money! Yes! Her name is Kalpana Devi. She's from a rich family. The highlight is that her relatives are all in America. A home nurse was handling things here. But she left in a very sad state. What I'm saying is that... Not just 10 Lakhs. We can ask even more than that. So tell me what the plan is. I'm not scared. I'm just... A tension, right? Like a bewilderment... That's fine. I have all that too. - You stay confident. - Oh God! So shall we go? Shall we go? All the best. Don't be scared. It's me. All okay, right? Come on. Don't go overboard. Act properly, okay? I'll handle all that. Just come. I'm scared whether Kajaji would go crazy. Carlos! I won't ask you to appreciate us. But don't discourage us... okay? - Get lost. - Come. Get into the van. You wait here. I'll go check and come. Okay. So be it. Ah! What are you doing here? I've been calling you for so long. Relatives are here to take Teacher's body. Come. Push it! Oh no! Mummy! Daddy! Mummy is gone, Daddy! Oh no! Daddy! Mummy is gone, Daddy! - Don't cry, dear. - No! - Don't overact. - Daddy! Come here. Rakesh, bring the register. Bring it quickly. Take it! Take it! Take it! Phew! Such a naive lady! I have some urgent work to do. Call me if there's any emergency. Unlike what we thought... Jalaja's acting was superb. It was so natural. I wasn't acting! I cried out of fear. - Really? - Yes. I felt so too. Hey! Dial their number on this phone. Here you go. It's switched off. Won't they reach? They are coming from America. We don't even know if they have left from there. What if they don't come? Carlosetta, don't be so negative. Can't see them, dude. She is calling. What is it? Hey! There's police checking on the way. Checking? Hey! It's the police. Why have we stopped here now? We're in an ambulance, right? We can go! Oh God! You go ahead. We'll reach now. What Happened? What happened, Carlosetta? What happened, Carlosetta? What happened? Hey! Go and check. What happened to this Vehicle!! What? -Its Mortuary van Sir!! What Happened?? Carlos? The entire team is here, huh? You may go. - Go. - Okay sir. Carlos! When did you become an ambulance driver? It's my mother's body, sir. Every time I see you, you'll have a body with you, huh? Are you going to bury this too? It's my mother's body. Oh! When your mother died, you became an ambulance driver. Okay. Let me see your mother's body. No, sir. Don't test us at this time. Let us go. Please sir. Hey! I understood. It's your mother. Let me see her once. Please. Get down. Oh God! Shit! So it was you, Sarojini? I was thinking who it would be. Are you taking the whole thing or... planning to leave a little for me? It's my mistake. I didn't give it when you asked me, right? So it's not wrong to take it. I didn't know that you and your husband are all the same. I'll go. Don't call the police, Madam. Police? If I call the police, I will also be trapped, Sarojini. We'll call some other people. - They will... - No, Madam. No, Madam. Let me go. Let go of my hand, Sarojini. I'll go away, Madam. Open it. Let me see the face. No one needs to know this. I'll send your share to your house. Move the cloth. I had decided to struggle anyway. At least by going abroad. What's the difference in going to a jail? I will confess. I will confess.
