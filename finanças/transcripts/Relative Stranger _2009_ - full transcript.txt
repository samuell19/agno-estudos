DOWN! SET! GO! Woman: CLEMONS! Man: GO, WALTER! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TOUCHDOWN! WALTER CLEMONS! Cheerleaders: HERE WE GO BOBCATS, HERE WE GO! Man: SET! HUT, HUT! [ GRUNTING ] Woman: AS EXPECTED, TOP-PROSPECT WALTER CLEMONS SIGNED WITH TECH TODAY. COACH BOCARD SAYS THE INCOMING FRESHMAN WILL HAVE TO EARN HIS SPOT, BUT ODDS ARE HE'LL GET PLENTY OF PLAYING TIME AND SOON. [ CHEERING ] Man: AND GRADY PITCHES IT TO THE FRESHMAN PHENOM CLEMONS, WHO GETS A BLOCK IN THE CORNER FROM THE SPLIT END. CLEMONS TO THE 40, THE 50, AND HE'S OFF TO THE RACES, LARRY! Man: WALTER CLEMONS IS SELECTED FIRST IN THIS YEAR'S DRAFT... THIS YOUNGSTER IS UNBELIEVABLE! ...JOINING THE PROS AS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY ANTICIPATED PICKS IN YEARS. CLEMONS AGAIN, AND HE SLIPPED THROUGH A SEAM, OFF TACKLE, MAKES A CUT -- MITCHELL LEVELS CLEMONS WITH A BLIND-SIDE TACKLE. CLEMONS IS DOWN, NOT GETTING UP. LOOKED LIKE THAT KNEE JUST BUCKLED. THE NEWS FOR WALTER CLEMONS IS NOT GOOD. THE ROOKIE RUNNING BACK WILL HAVE TO UNDERGO COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION ON HIS INJURED KNEE. WE'RE HIGHLY DOUBTFUL THAT HE WOULD RETURN THIS, OR ANY OTHER, SEASON. [ CAR HORN HONKS ] Man: HEY, WALTER. HEY. [ SIGHS ] THERE YOU GO, WALTER. DON'T SPEND IT ALL IN ONE PLACE. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. TOMORROW? NO, YOU WON'T. WHY NOT? CHECK THE BOARD. YOU'RE NOT ON AGAIN TILL SUNDAY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA HELP ME PICK UP SOME EXTRA SHIFTS. I SAID I WAS GONNA TRY. I TRIED. THE WEEKEND'S THE SOONEST I CAN DO. OH, COME ON, MAN. I COULD USE THE EXTRA MONEY. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T DO IT. THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH WORK TO GO AROUND RIGHT NOW. YEAH. [ SIGHS ] Nicole: "MR. WALTER CLEMONS, WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU "OF THE PASSING OF YOUR FATHER, MR. JAMES ANDREW CLEMONS SR. "PLEASE ACCEPT OUR SINCEREST CONDOLENCES. "AS IS THE CASE IN SUCH AN EVENT, "THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF MR. JAMES CLEMONS SR. SHALL BE READ TO THE MEMBERS OF MR. CLEMONS' FAMILY." YOU OKAY? I'M FINE. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE FOR THIS, YOU KNOW. YES, I DID. I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVED YOUR GRANDFATHER. YEAH, BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FEEL OBLIGATED, THAT'S ALL. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT, OKAY? BELIEVE ME, I WANTED TO BE HERE. James: HE ALWAYS LIKED YOU. [ CLEARS THROAT ] THANK YOU. GOODBYE, MR. CLEMONS. SHAWN, YOU TAKING OFF? YES, SIR. THANKS FOR COMING. YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU KNOW, I COULD STICK AROUND A LITTLE BIT LONGER IF YOU WANT ME TO. THAT'S OKAY. WE'RE JUST GONNA BE CLEANING UP. [ SIGHS ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GRANDMA. Pearl: YOU'RE WELCOME, ANDY. OOH. THERE. DOES GRANDDADDY HEAR US WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HIM? I BET HE HEARD ALL THOSE THINGS THOSE FOLKS WERE SAYING ABOUT HIM TODAY. [ LAUGHS ] DOES HE KNOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HIM? OF COURSE HE DOES. OKAY, GOOD. HOW? WELL... WHEN PEOPLE WE LOVE LEAVE US... SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL HAPPENS TO THEM. THEY JUST KNOW. DOES MY FATHER KNOW? ANDY, YOUR FATHER'S ALIVE. BUT HE'S NOT HERE. NO, HE'S NOT. [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ] SET THEM DOWN THERE IN THE SINK. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM. IT'S OKAY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM. AND DENISE IS GOING TO HELP ME. I AM? ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. DO YOU NEED ANYTHING? YES. I REALLY NEED FOR YOU TO GO GET SOME REST. YOU'VE HAD A REALLY LONG DAY. CHARLOTTE... I HAVE JUST BURIED MY HUSBAND OF 62 YEARS. THE LTHING I WANT TO DO IS SIT IN A QUIET ROOM BY MYSELF. [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ] ALMOST HAD A DRINK TODAY, GARY. WOULD HAVE BEEN MY FIRST ONE IN 9 MONTHS AND 14 DAYS. IT'S A GOOD THING YOU CAME HERE INSTEAD. WHAT'S GOING ON? MY FATHER DIED. I'M SORRY. WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. I JUST KNOW HE PASSED AWAY. I WISH IT WAS BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO RECONNECT WITH YOUR FAMILY. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, GARY. BEEN A LONG TIME, MAN. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ME, ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS. WHY NOT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WHY NOT"? BECAUSE I BLEW IT. I WALKED OUT ON THEM. NONE OF US ARE PERFECT, WALTER. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TRY. I'M SURE YOUR FAMILY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH, WELL... YOU KNOW WHAT? WITH JUST MY LUCK, I'D GET DOWN THERE AND DISCOVER THAT THEY'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME, ANYWAY. MAYBE THEY ARE. YOU DIDN'T EXPECT ME TO JUST QUOTE SOME SCRIPTURE AND LET YOU OFF THE HOOK, DID YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED, GARY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? A LITTLE MORAL SUPPORT RIGHT NOW WOULD BE COOL. WALTER, THIS IS MORAL SUPPORT. YOU'RE SCARED, AND YOU SHOULD BE BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA BE HARD. ASKING FORGIVENESS IS ALWAYS HARD. BUT HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN YOUR FAMILY. THEY'RE EXPECTING YOU, RIGHT? I'M NAMED IN THE WILL. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO CLAIM WHATEVER INHERITANCE HE LEFT ME. YOUR FATHER HAVE MONEY? GARY, I DON'T WANT HIS MONEY. I'D RATHER GIVE IT TO MY KIDS. THEY AT LEAST DESERVE THAT. THEN GIVE IT TO THEM. THAT'S AN EVEN BETTER REASON FOR GOING BACK. [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] HI. HI. YOU DOING OKAY? YEAH. YOUR GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT YOUR FATHER THE OTHER DAY. NO, I WASN'T. SWEETHEART, IF THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR FATHER YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT, YOU CAN TELL ME. I JUST WISH HE WAS HERE, THAT'S ALL. I KNOW, SWEETHEART. AND IT'S OKAY TO FEEL THAT WAY. OKAY. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? WELL, ANDY... ...I DON'T REALLY KNOW. HE WENT AWAY TO LOOK FOR A JOB, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, I WOULD HEAR FROM HIM, UNTIL ONE DAY I REALIZED THAT, UM... HE WAS GONE. SO YOU...DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW? I'M NOT SURE. GRANDMA SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN I'M THINKING ABOUT HIM... 'CAUSE ONLY DEAD PEOPLE KNOW THAT. YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S A VERY SMART LADY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT? I BET YOU THAT WHEREVER HE IS, HE'S THINKING ABOUT YOU. Nicole: I'M REALLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO FIND ME. UM, YOU KNOW WHAT? I-I REALLY DON'T WANT TO, UH, TAKE UP ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME, SO IF YOU JUST LET ME SIGN WHATEVER PAPERS YOU HAVE FOR ME, I'LL TAKE WHAT I'M GETTING AND BE ON MY WAY. WHAT YOU'RE GETTING? YEAH, FROM MY FATHER. YOUR LETTER SAID THERE WAS A WILL. HE DID, BUT IF YOU READ THAT LETTER CAREFULLY, YOU'LL SEE THE WILL READING ISN'T UNTIL NEXT WEEK. YEAH, BUT CAN'T YOU PUSH IT UP EARLIER? YOUR FATHER LEFT BEHIND A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF INSTRUCTIONS. [ SCOFFS ] HAVE YOU TALKED TO YOUR MOTHER YET? IT'S, UM -- IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED. 'CAUSE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS THE POWER TO DO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS YOUR MOTHER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN, SHE CONTROLS THE ESTATE. SO IF SHE WERE TO TELL ME TO HONOR YOUR REQUEST, THEN I'D DO IT. SO YOU CAN SPEED THIS PROCESS UP? IFTHAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS. HI, MAMA. [ CHUCKLES ] I MISSED YOU. I DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE. YOU KNEW WHERE TO FIND ME. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I DID. YOU GOT NO IDEA HOW HARD IT WAS BEING AWAY FROM YOU, MAMA. OH, JUST COME ON IN HERE. [ SOBS ] HEY. SIX YEARS IS TOO LONG FOR A MAN TO BE AWAY FROM HIS SON AND DAUGHTER. I KNOW, MA. I DIDN'T EXPECT THINGS TO...TURN OUT THIS WAY. HOW DIDYOU EXPECT THINGS TO TURN OUT, SON? I MEAN, YOU LEFT HERE TO TAKE THIS BIG JOB IN ATLANTA, SAYING YOU WOULD SEND FOR CHARLOTTE AND THE KIDS AS SOON AS YOU GOT SETTLED, AND WE NEVER HEARD FROM YOU AGAIN. THAT'S 'CAUSE I RAN INTO SOME PROBLEMS. THE JOB IN ATLANTA DIDN'T WORK OUT. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU COME BACK HOME? DON'T YOU THINK I WANTED TO? I COULDN'T COME BACK HERE EMPTY-HANDED. EVERYBODY WAS -- WAS COUNTING ON ME. Walter: SO I CHECKED AROUND, AND, UH... I-I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS JOB IN CHICAGO, THIS SPORTS-ANCHOR JOB. AND, YOU KNOW, BUT WHEN I GOT THERE, THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN ME. I COULDN'T EVEN GET MY FOOT IN THE DOOR. NOW, WHAT HAS ALL THAT GOT TO DO WITH YOUR NOT COMING BACK HOME TO YOUR FAMILY? MA, EVER SINCE I HURT MYSELF AND STOPPED PLAYING FOOTBALL... NOTHING'S GONE RIGHT FOR ME. CHICAGO THING WAS THE LAST STRAW. JUST NEVER BOUNCED BACK. THIS, UM... THIS LETTER FROM YOUR LAWYER SAYS THAT DADDY NAMED ME IN HIS WILL. IF THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS... IT'S THE TRUTH. MA... ...I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME, OKAY? I NEED YOU TO PUSH UP THE READING OF THE WILL. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN BIT OF A HURRY. I AM. IT'S NOT LIKE HE EVER GAVE ME ANYTHING, ANYWAY. BESIDES LIFE. OH, COME ON, MA, THE MAN HATED ME. NEVER TREATED ME LIKE A SON, AND YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW, HE NEVER SAID IT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE THIS IS JUST HIS WAY OF ADMITTING THAT HE KNOWS HE WAS WRONG, AND THAT'S WHY HE WANTS ME HERE. FORGET IT. NEVER MIND. FOR YOU. OH. OOH. YOU'RE ON FIRE TODAY. WAY TO MAKE MY OTHER SALESPEOPLE LOOK BAD. THAT WASN'T MY INTENTION, KAREN, BUT THANK YOU. HUH. YOU FEEL LIKE SITTING IN ON A REGIONAL SALES MEETING TOMORROW? I WOULD LOVE TO. GREAT. I'LL SEE YOU BRIGHT AND EARLY. YOU SURE WILL. [ FOOTSTEPS DEPART ] YOU JUST JUMPED RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD AND KEPT ON GOING. [ BOTH LAUGH ] HEY, WHAT'S UP, JAMES? I'M NOT REALLY SEEING THIS, AM I? COME OVER HERE AND HAVE A SEAT, JAMES. NO, NO, I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK I WILL, MA. WHAT'S HE DOING HERE, AND, BETTER YET, WHERE'S HE BEEN? BEEN JUST TRYING TO GET BACK ON MY FEET. I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU. YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE SITTING AROUND HERE LIKE YOU BELONG. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I WON'T BE HERE LONG. GOOD, BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE HERE FOR YOU -- NOT AFTER ALL THIS TIME. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I DIDN'T THINK THERE WOULD BE. WELL, WHY DID YOU BOTHER TO COME BACK, HUH? THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT IN ATLANTA LIKE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD. YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T -- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW. I-I DON'T CARE, ALL RIGHT? JUST GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE NOW. YOUR BROTHER ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I SAID SO. THAT'S WHY NOT. OH. HMM. I SEE HOW IT IS. HAVE FUN. [ FOOTSTEPS DEPART ] JAMES. [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] [ DRAWER RATTLES ] HEY, ANDY. HI. WHERE'S YOUR MOM? FIGHTING. SINCE WHEN ARE YOU ALLOWED TO HAVE BOYS HERE WHEN I'M NOT HOME? I DON'T HAVE BOYS OVER, MOM. IT'S JUST SHAWN. YOU KNOW HIM. YOU JUST LOST YOUR CELLPHONE. WHAT? HEY, HEY, HEY. LOOK AT THIS -- I THINK I GOT SOMETHING. YOU GOT TO GO HOME. OKAY, JUST LOOK AT IT FIRST. JUST... OH. I'LL CALL YOU LATER, AND WE CAN GO OVER IT. NO, YOU CAN'T BECAUSE SHE TOOK MY PHONE. THAT'S ENOUGH, DENISE. UNCLE JAMES, WOULD YOU PLEASE TALK TO HER? 'CAUSE SHE'S ACTING LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END. [ SIGHS ] YOU MIGHT WANT TO MOVE A LITTLE FASTER. OKAY, FINE. TAKE HER SIDE. THIS IS SO UNFAIR. MAYBE IT IS, BUT WE'RE DONE TALKING ABOUT IT. I SWEAR I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT DENISE. I THINK SOMETIMES SHE JUST TESTS ME ON PURPOSE. SHE'LL BE FINE. I KNOW. BUT I'M GLAD YOU CAME WHEN YOU DID. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU WALTER WAS BACK? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME? HE'S HERE RIGHT NOW, WALKING AROUND MY MOM'S HOUSE LIKE NOT A DAY'S GONE BY. YOU REMEMBER YOUR HUSBAND? WALTER HASN'T BEEN MY HUSBAND SINCE HE WALKED OUT ON ME AND OUR KIDS. WELL, YOU REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU GO SEE HIM. I MEAN, YOU STILL HAVE A CONNECTION WITH HIM BECAUSE OF THE KIDS. THAT'S TRUE. I DO. BUT I WANT A FUTURE WITH YOU. YOU LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING MAKES YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND. ARE YOU TRYING TO START A FIGHT WITH ME? YOU SEE... I HAVE THIS SPECIAL HEADLOCK THAT MY BROTHERS USED TO USE ON ME, AND I'VE BEEN SAVING IT JUST IN CASE YOU GOT TOO FAR OUT OF LINE. [ CHUCKLES ] GOOD MORNING. MORNING. SLEEP OKAY? YEAH. THE BED WAS JUST THE WAY I REMEMBERED IT. A LOT OF THINGS AROUND HERE JUST LIKE YOU REMEMBER IT. I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE TOO MUCH, REMEMBER? I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND LONG, MA. [ Sighing ] WALTER... AREN'T YOU CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN AND HOW THEY ARE? YEAH. I'M SORRY I LEFT THEM. BUT AT LEAST I LEFT THEM IN GOOD HANDS. I KNOW THEY'RE FINE. AND I KNOW THEY'RE A WHOLE LOT BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME. BREAK YOUR FATHER'S HEART, HEAR YOU TALKING LIKE THAT. [ SCOFFS ] I DOUBT IT. I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE TRYING TO SATISFY HIM, BUT NOTHING I EVER DID COULD PLEASE HIM. SO, YOU KNOW, I -- ACTUALLY, I THINK HE'D ENJOY SEEING ME FAIL AS A FATHER. YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME! YOUR FATHER MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT MAN, BUT THERE'S ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU TWO. WHEN THINGS GOT HARD -- AND I PROMISE YOU TIMES WERE HARDER FOR US THAN THEY EVER WERE FOR YOU -- BUT HE NEVER TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS FAMILY. [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] I BET I CAN GUESS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. I DOUBT IT, OR YOU WOULDN'T BE STANDING OUT HERE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WHERE I CAN GET A CLEAN SHOT AT YOU. OKAY, I DESERVE THAT. YOU KNOW, UH, CHARLOTTE... I-I-I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN, WALTER. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I DID, BUT I'VE WASTED TOO MANY YEARS WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THAT. ANYWAY, I HEARD YOU WERE BACK IN TOWN, AND I HAD TO SEE FOR MYSELF. DO THE KIDS KNOW I'M BACK? NO, AND UNLESS YOU PLAN ON STICKING AROUND, I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. YEAH, WELL -- YEAH, I GUESS IT'S BEST. BUT I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU DIDN'T PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS. IT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ] AHA. SO, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE. CHANCE AT WHAT? TO SAY WHY YOU LEFT. CHARLOTTE CALLED AND SAID YOU OFFERED TO EXPLAIN IT TO HER IF SHE WANTED TO HEAR IT. SO, HEY, MAN, I...I WANT TO HEAR IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING, JAMES, BUT IT'S NOT A VERY EXCITING STORY. OH, NO, BUT IT HAS TO BE. I MEAN, WHY ELSE WOULD YOU WALK OUT ON YOUR FAMILY AND NOT COME BACK UNTIL NOW? YOU SEE, I FIGURED THAT YOU STRUCK IT RICH IN ATLANTA AND YOU FORGOT ABOUT US. OR -- OR YOU MET ANOTHER WOMAN, YOU STARTED ANOTHER FAMILY, AND FORGOT ABOUT US. NO, WHICH -- WHICH WAS IT? [ SCOFFS ] IT WAS NEITHER. ARE YOU BROKE? IS THAT WHY YOU CAME BACK -- BECAUSE OUR FATHER'S DEAD A-AND YOU NEEDED TO CASH IN? MAN... PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU ARE NOT THAT KIND OF MAN. DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF, SON? IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. I'D SAY YOU'RE WORKING REAL HARD AT MAKING IT ABOUT YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, MA, HUH? YOU WANT ME TO CLOSE MY EYES AND PRETEND LIKE WALTER BEING HERE IS OKAY? NO. HE ONLY CAME BACK HERE FOR MONEY. AND YOU -- YOU TOOK HIM IN HERE LIKE HE'S BEEN GONE FOR SIX WEEKS INSTEAD OF SIX YEARS. NOW, WHY ARE YOU BEING SO EASY ON HIM?! BECAUSE HE'S MY CHILD. NOW, DON'T YOU THINK I'D DO THE SAME FOR YOU? [ ENGINE TURNS OFF ] WHAT'S THIS? IT'S A HIGH SCHOOL. WELL, I KNOW IT'S A HIGH SCHOOL. IT'S NOT OUR OLD SCHOOL. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? [ SIGHS ] LOOK. Man: RUN IT OUT, BOBCATS, RUN IT OUT. THOSE ARE YOUR KIDS, WALTER. SHE'S GOT SOME MEDALS, A LOT OF TROPHIES, TOO. THEY SAY SHE'S A NATURAL. I HEAR THAT HER FATHER WAS SOME, UH -- SOME HOTSHOT ATHLETE, BUT...NOBODY KNOWS WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM. HOW LONG'S SHE BEEN RUNNING? ASK HER. VERY FUNNY. I KNOW YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT ME OUT HERE -- [ WHISTLES ] HEY! COME HERE. [ LAUGHS ] HEY, IT'S UNCLE JAMES! I'M GONNA KILL YOU WHEN WE GET BACK TO THE HOUSE. I'M NOT WORRIED. YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE THROUGH THIS. SLOWPOKE. [ LAUGHS ] HI, UNCLE JAMES. HEY, WHAT'S UP, ANDY? WHAT, YOU CAN'T SPEAK ALL OF A SUDDEN? WHY DID YOU BRING HIM HERE? HEY, DENISE. DON'T REMEMBER MY NAME. DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE ME. JUST LET ME GO ON THINKING YOU FORGOT YOU EVEN HAD A FAMILY, AND THAT'S WHY YOU LEFT AND NEVER CAME BACK. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE. LET'S GO. GO, COME ON. HEY. Denise: HEY. SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT NOW? WELL, IT'S LUNCHTIME, AND I WASN'T HUNGRY, SO I FIGURED I'D STOP BY. BUT IF YOU'RE BUSY, I CAN -- NO, NO, SURE. I'VE -- I'VE GOT TIME FOR YOU. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU BROUGHT HIM TO MY SCHOOL. YOU MEAN YOUR FATHER. DON'T CALL HIM THAT. YEAH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SPRUNG HIM ON YOU AND ANDY LIKE THAT. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HOW YOU'D FEEL. IT WAS WRONG. I'M SORRY. IT'S OKAY. I FIGURED YOU ONLY DID IT 'CAUSE YOU HATE HIM, ANYWAY. I DON'T HATE HIM. I JUST... [ SIGHS ] IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED. RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU'RE WITH MOM NOW. YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S PART OF IT. Denise: SO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING -- THAT ME AND ANDY ARE GONNA FORGET EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE FOR US AND GO RUNNING BACK TO HIM? YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT, YOU KNOW. I DON'T? NO, WE LOVE YOU. THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE JUST 'CAUSE HE CAME BACK. GOOD, BECAUSE I KIND OF LIKE HAVING YOU AND YOUR BROTHER AROUND. WELL, GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'RE KIND OF STUCK WITH US. HI. HEY. COME IN. I'M JUST READING THE PAPER. ALL RIGHT. UM...I HAVE TO, UH, TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT'S ABOUT THE KIDS. WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS? WELL, YOU KNOW HOW YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM KNOWING THAT WALTER WAS BACK? YES. WELL, THEY KNOW HE'S BACK. HOW? BECAUSE I SORT OF TOOK HIM TO SEE THEM. YOU SORT OF TOOK HIM? JAMES, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? NO, I KNOW IT WAS STUPID, AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. I JUST -- I REALLY WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT. I'M HAVING A HARD ENOUGH TIME DEALING WITH THIS, JAMES. I DON'T NEED YOU WORKING AGAINST ME. I NEED YOU ON MY SIDE. I AM ON YOUR SIDE, BABY. AND I PROMISE YOU THAT NOTHING LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. GOOD. I'LL CALL YOU LATER. ALL RIGHT. James: ALL RIGHT, CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME. WHAT YOU DOING, SWEETHEART? READING. ABOUT ATLANTA. WHY ATLANTA? 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE DADDY WENT WHEN HE LEFT. I HEARD YOU SAW HIM YESTERDAY. YEAH. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD? I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE SAD. SWEETHEART, WHY'D YOU THINK I'D BE SAD? WELL, YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS. SO I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD CRY IF YOU FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS HERE. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU? GOOD. BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO PROTECT ME. OKAY? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ASK ME? HOW COME HE DOESN'T LIKE US? MM. ANDY, I AM SURE DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE STILL DOES. [ DOORBELL RINGING ] I PACKED YOUR LUNCH. WAIT, DID I FORGET YOUR LUNCH? I GOT IT. OKAY, GOOD. HI, GRANDMA. MORNING, BABY. WHY DON'T YOU TELL YOUR MAMA YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR HER TO BE FUSSING OVER YOU? GRANDMA SAYS YOU'RE LATE FOR WORK. OH, YOU JUST GIVE ME A KISS. I'M SO SORRY, BUT JAMES WAS BUSY AND DENISE HAD TRACK PRACTICE, AND I COULDN'T GET A SITTER ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. CHARLOTTE, STOP WORRYING. WE'LL BE FINE. IS WALTER HERE? TOOK THE CAR THIS MORNING. HE SAID HE'D BE BACK IN A WHILE. I REALLY WISH YOU WOULD HAVE COME TO MY PLACE INSTEAD, PEARL. I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING HIM HERE. HE'S BEEN COMING HERE HIS WHOLE LIFE. TODAY'S NO DIFFERENT. TODAY ISDIFFERENT. HIS FATHER IS BACK. I THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WITH IT. YEAH, WELL... I THINK THEY'LL BOTH HAVE A HARD TIME. BUT THEY'RE MEN. JUST HAVE TO SUCK IT UP. OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, THANKS. I'LL BE BACK RIGHT AFTER WORK. TAKE YOUR TIME, HON. THE ANSWER'S NOT IN THERE. IF IT'S NOT IN THE DICTIONARY, IT'S NOT A WORD. JUST SAYING, YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND IT THAT WAY. GIVE ME THE CLUE AGAIN. 1960 AND 2008. HAVE MANY LETTERS? NINE. OH, IT STARTS WITH AN "L." 1960, 2008... I REMEMBER THEM AS BEING... ELECTION YEARS... AND AS LEAP YEARS. [ GASPS ] IS THAT THE ANSWER? [ LAUGHS ] LEAP YEARS? [ DOOR OPENS ] YEAH! LEAP YEARS -- L... [ DOOR CLOSES ] ...E-A-P-Y-E-A-R-S. YES! YES! YES! HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT? BECAUSE YOUR GRANDMA IS A SMART, OLD GRANDMA. THAT'S HOW. HEY. MORNING, SON. WHAT'S GOING ON? WELL, I WAS DOING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE THAT MY GRANDSON MADE UP, AND I'M GOOD AT IT, TOO, AREN'T I? TELL YOUR DAD HOW GOOD I AM, ANDY. HERE. WHY DON'T YOU TRY? COME ON. UH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S -- NO. Pearl: WELL, I GUESS WE'LL JUST LEAVE HIM SITTING THERE LIKE THAT. HE USUALLY MAKES A LOT OF NOISE ONCE HE GETS HUNGRY ENOUGH. [ SIGHS ] SO, UM... ...YOU KNOW WHO I AM, DON'T YOU? I'VE SEEN PICTURES OF YOU. YEAH. WELL... [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] [ SIGHS, CHUCKLES ] IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN COME IN. COME ON. HERE WE GO. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU. YOU REMEMBER THAT? [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, WELL, YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN 3 OR 4 WHEN THAT WAS TAKEN. I LOOK FUNNY. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU THINK SO? OH. KEYS. WHOA. [ CHUCKLES ] MAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. IS IT YOURS? USED TO BE. HEY, YOU WANT IT? YEAH. YEAH? ALL RIGHT. HOLD ON, I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. YOU LET ME WALK YOU HOME, IT'S ALL YOURS. OKAY. [ CHUCKLES ] GOTCHA. ALL RIGHT, KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL. HERE WE GO. GO, GO, GO, GO. GOT IT. [ DOOR OPENS ] HEY, BEAN-HEAD, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR DINNER. I ATE ALREADY, WITH DADDY. ARE YOU COMING IN? UH, YEAH, YEAH, IF IT'S OKAY. JUST DON'T EMBARRASS ME. I HAVE COMPANY. [ CLEARS THROAT ] HEY, MAN, WHAT'S UP? I'M WALTER. I KNOW. I'M SHAWN. UH, I-I BROUGHT ANDY HOME. PEARL CALLED ME AND TOLD ME YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY. HE'S A GREAT KID. I KNOW THAT ALREADY, WALTER. YEAH, YOU WOULD. DENISE IS SO OVERPROTECTIVE OF HIM. SHE CAN BE DIFFICULT AT TIMES, BUT SHE REALLY STEPPED UP AFTER YOU LEFT. I THINK SHE FEELS THE NEED TO TAKE YOUR PLACE IN HIS LIFE. AND SHE'S OBSESSIVE ABOUT SPORTS, JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS WERE. WHAT DID SHE SAY WHEN SHE KNEW I WASN'T COMING BACK? SHE DIDN'T SAY A WORD. AND I COULDN'T HELP HER MAKE SENSE OF IT BECAUSE I NEVER GOT AN EXPLANATION MYSELF. YEAH. YEAH. YOU COULD HAVE COME BACK, WALTER. WE WOULD HAVE WORKED IT OUT. PART OF ME BELIEVED THAT. I THINK A BIGGER PART OF ME JUST GOT LOST, THOUGH. AND I STARTED DRINKING, AND... I, UH -- I BLEW THROUGH WHATEVER LITTLE MONEY I HAD, AND THEN... YOU KNOW, STUFF JUST GOT [SIGHS DEEPLY] JUST CRAZY. TRUTH BE TOLD, CHARLOTTE... I ALWAYS KNEW MY LIFE WAS GONNA END UP LIKE THIS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, YOU KNOW... FOOTBALL ALWAYS CAME EASY TO ME. IT WAS THE ONLY THING I EVER DID. BUT EVER SINCE I WAS, UM, I DON'T KNOW, WHAT -- 14... I KNEW IT WASN'T GONNA LAST. YEAH, YOU KNOW, MY FATHER PUSHED ME LIKE A MADMAN, AND I SPENT ALL THOSE YEARS BACK THEN JUST TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT. HUH. I NEVER TOLD ANYBODY THAT. [ CLEARS THROAT ] WHAT IS IT, SHAWN? UH, I THOUGHT I SHOULD TELL SOMEBODY THAT DENISE WENT UPSTAIRS, AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S COMING BACK DOWN. UM, YOU MIND IF I TRY TO GO TALK TO HER? BE MY GUEST. WHERE'S HER ROOM? DOWN THE HALL ON THE -- SECOND DOOR ON THE LEFT. UH, I-I THINK...THINK IT'S THE SECOND DOOR ON THE LEFT. I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY... BEEN UP THERE. [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] HI. CAN I COME IN? IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND DOWNSTAIRS? [ SIGHS ] SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HE HASN'T EARNED ANY TITLES YET. HE'S NOT BAD-LOOKING. DID HE SAY HIS NAME WAS, UH, SHAWN? HISNAME? IS THAT WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT? SHOULDN'T YOU BE ASKING ME ABOUT ME? DENISE -- "HOW'S YOUR GRADES, DENISE?" "I DIDN'T KNOW YOU RAN TRACK, DENISE." "OH, I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WAS THIS BIG, DENISE." LOOK, I JUST THOUGHT I GAVE UP THE RIGHT TO ASK YOU THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS, THAT'S ALL. OH, YOU DID. BUT YOU SHOULD STILL WANT TO KNOW. WHY DID YOU COME UP HERE? BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE MY LITTLE GIRL. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, YOU DON'T SEE SOMEBODY FOR A LONG TIME, YOUR MEMORY OF THEM BECOMES BLURRY, YOU KNOW? YEAH, I DO. BUT I THINK I'D RATHER REMEMBER YOU THAT WAY. AND WHY'S THAT? BECAUSE EVEN A BLURRY IMAGE OF YOU HAS GOT TO BE BETTER THAN THE REAL THING. DENISE ALL RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. I HOPE SO. AT THIS POINT, YOU PROBABLY KNOW HER BETTER THAN I DO, ANYWAY. HMM, I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SHE PUSHES ME AWAY ALL THE TIME... LIKE SHE'S WAITING FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING WRONG. YEAH, WELL, DON'T BLAME YOURSELF ON THAT ONE. IT PROBABLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH ME THAN YOU, ANYWAY. YEAH, I KIND OF FIGURED THAT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER, SHAWN. GOOD NIGHT, NUMBER 33. YOU KNOW MY NUMBER? OF COURSE. YOU WERE A STAR IN HIGH SCHOOL, EVEN BIGGER STAR IN COLLEGE, AND YOU RUSHED FOR MORE YARDS THAN ANYBODY IN THE LEAGUE YOUR FIRST SEASON. YEAH, BUT YOU WERE, UH, WHAT, PRACTICALLY A BABY THEN? YEAH, BUT THERE'S FOOTAGE OF YOU ALL OVER THE INTERNET. YOU GOT A LOT OF FANS, MAN. YEAH, WELL, NOT AS MANY AS I USED TO HAVE, THAT'S FOR SURE. HEY, HOW'D YOU KEEP ALL THE -- THE FAME FROM GETTING TO YOUR HEAD? [ LAUGHS ] [ Laughing ] WHO SAID I DID? ONLY PROBLEM WAS I DIDN'T REALIZE IT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. ONE DAY, I SNAPPED MY KNEE, AND, UH, THE DOCTOR SAID I'D NEVER PLAY FOOTBALL AGAIN. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, SIX YEARS GO BY, AND I DON'T EVEN SEE MY FAMILY. [ SCOFFS ] HEY, MAN, SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO LAY ALL THAT ON YOU, YOUNGBLOOD. I UNDERSTAND, MR. CLEMONS. MY FATHER ACTUALLY RAN OUT ON ME AND MY BROTHERS, TOO, SO, UH... I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

CALL YOU? YEAH. MM, YOU KEEP THAT UP, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO COME INSIDE. James: DON'T TEMPT ME. YOU KNOW I WILL. WALTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I GUESS THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR LEAVING THE TWO OF YOU ALONE, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOUT STANDING HERE, WATCHING MY BROTHER KISSING ON MY WIFE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. SHE'S NOT YOUR WIFE ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT? SHE'S YOUR EX-WIFE, AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. SHE ISMY WIFE! WAIT, STOP! LISTEN, I DON'T NEED YOU TWO OUT HERE MAKING A SCENE. AND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND LISTEN TO YOU ACCUSE ME OF ANYTHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE. I CAME HERE 'CAUSE I NEEDED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO. EVIDENTLY, I CAME TO THE WRONG PLACE. YEAH, YOU DID. YOU CAME TO THE WRONG PLACE. YOU KNOW WHAT, JAMES? AIN'T NOBODY EVEN TALKING TO YOU, MAN! YEAH, NO, NO, YOU -- JUST GO! [ SCOFFS ] YEAH. I'LL CALL YOU LATER. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] I'M REALLY SORRY YOU HAD TO SEE THAT. IT'S OKAY. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT. OKAY. I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. HOW? YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU'D EVER SEE HIM AGAIN. NONE OF US DID. IT WAS LIKE HE WAS DEAD OR SOMETHING. HONEY, I KNOW, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER. WELL, IT SHOULD. HE HAS NO RIGHT TO COME BACK HERE AND JUDGE ANYBODY. HE'S THE ONE WHO WALKED OUT ON US. WE CAN DATE WHOEVER WE WANT. "WE"? YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YOU -- YOU CAN DATE WHOEVER YOU WANT. UNLESS... UNLESS WHAT? WELL, YOU ARE... WITH UNCLE JAMES BECAUSE YOU REALLY LIKE HIM, RIGHT? OF COURSE I AM. OKAY. [ CLEARS THROAT ] WAIT A MINUTE. NOW, YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JAMES WAS BECAUSE OF SOME KIND OF REVENGE AGAINST YOUR FATHER? WELL, I DID AT FIRST. BUT, WAIT, I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE UNCLE JAMES. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ALL... A LITTLE BIT WEIRD, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GUYS STARTED DATING RIGHT AFTER DAD LEFT. THAT'S RIGHT. WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TOGETHER A YEAR. NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE LIKE, UM, A YEAR AND A HALF. YOU GUYS TRIED TO KEEP IT SECRET AT FIRST. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? MOM, PLEASE. YOU ARE GOOD AT A LOT OF THINGS, BUT BEING SNEAKY IS NOT ONE OF THEM. YOU'RE A PRETTY SHARP COOKIE. YOU KNOW THAT? YEAH, I DO KNOW THAT. YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO ME MORE OFTEN. OH. HEY... SO, DOES THIS MEAN I GET MY CELLPHONE BACK? NOT YET. BUT ALMOST. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING HOW MY LEAVING AFFECTED CHARLOTTE. BUT THE TWO OF YOU GETTING TOGETHER? [ SCOFFS ] NEVER SAW THAT ONE COMING. NEITHER DID WE. [ SCOFFS ] WHAT DID YOU EXPECT US TO DO, WALTER -- JUST SIT AROUND AND WAIT FOR YOU TO COME BACK AND FIND US JUST LIKE YOU LEFT US? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED, JAMES. [ SIGHS ] [ DIALING ] [ Ringing ] [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] HELLO? HEY, GARY, WHAT'S UP, MAN? IT'S WALTER. Walter, are you back in town? NO. I'M STILL HERE. So, how's it going? [ Sighing ] OH, MAN, I SHOULD HAVE NEVER COME BACK. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER MY FATHER HAS WAITING FOR ME, IT CAN'T BE WORTH ALL THIS. LET ME GUESS -- YOUR FAMILY'S GIVING YOU A HARD TIME? [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT. ARE YOU IN A BAR RIGHT NOW, WALTER? NO. Are you thinking about going to one? NO, GARY. THEN HOW HARD CAN IT BE? WELL, UH, LET'S SEE. UM...MY DAUGHTER HATES ME, MY SON BARELY KNOWS ME, AND SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE, MY BROTHER'S STARTED DATING MY WIFE. THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL? [ LAUGHS ] DEAL WITH IT. DEAL WITH IT? THAT'S IT? THAT'S -- They're your family. YOU ABANDONED THEM. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MAD AT YOU. Look, just stick with the original plan. GET YOUR INHERITANCE CHECK, GIVE IT TO YOUR KIDS, AND GET OUT OF THERE. UH, I-I MEAN, I GOT TO WAIT A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE WILL READING. Well... I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO, YOU KNOW... YEAH. DEAL WITH IT. Thanks a lot, Gary. [ CHUCKLES, SCOFFS ] [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] [ ENGINE SPUTTERS ] HAVEN'T HEARD THAT SOUND IN A LONG TIME. DON'T YOU EVER GO HOME? [ SIGHS ] MAN, I GOT BIG PLANS FOR THIS THING. YEAH, WELL, DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP. WELL, SOME OF US FINISH WHAT WE START. YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET YOU, JAMES. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? HUH? YOU ARE. I MEAN, BESIDES THE OBVIOUS, YOU KNOW, YOU WALK AROUND HERE JUDGING ME LIKE YOU WHO I AM. YOU DON'T KNOW ME. WELL, HOW CAN I, HUH? YOU'RE NEVER AROUND. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, MAN? NO, REALLY, I WANT TO KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED? SEE, Y-YOU -- YOU GOT NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE KNOWING YOUR ENTIRE LIFE THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU BLOW IT ALL. LIKE THAT DAY I GOT HURT, I DID A MOVE I DID A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I END UP WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS ON ME, MY KNEE GOES IN ONE DIRECTION, AND THE REST OF MY BODY GOES IN ANOTHER, AND YOU WANT TO KNOW THE FUNNY THING? EVER SINCE I WAS A KID, I KNEW THAT MOMENT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. THAT'S WHO I AM. YEAH, WELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE ENDED YOUR CAREER, BUT YOU STILL HAD A FAMILY. OH, RIGHT. I-I COULD JUST HANG AROUND HERE AND LET YOU ALL SEE ME FAIL, ESPECIALLY MY KIDS? NO, MAN. THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T COME BACK. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP WHEN I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO BE YOU. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? SLEEPING WITH MY WIFE DOESN'T MAKE YOU ME, JAMES. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU CAN CALL HER YOUR WIFE WHENEVER IT SUITS YOU, BUT WHAT WAS SHE TO YOU ALL THE YEARS THAT YOU WERE GONE, HUH? WAS SHE YOUR WIFE THEN? NO, SHE WAS OFF-LIMITS TO YOU. THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS. YOU GAVE UP A GOOD WOMAN, WALTER -- A WOMAN WHO DEVOTED HER ENTIRE LIFE TO YOU, GAVE YOU TWO AMAZING KIDS, AND YOU BROKE HER HEART. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S A GOOD THING THAT SHE HAD GOOD OLD, RELIABLE JAMES TO LEAN ON. YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S A GOOD THING SHE HAD ME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW SHE'S OFF-LIMITS TO YOU. WHAT? [ CHUCKLES ] YOU AIN'T EVEN WORTH IT, MAN. [ CHUCKLES ] [ DOOR OPENS ] I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE SERIOUS. WHO? JAMES AND CHARLOTTE? SEEM PRETTY SERIOUS TO ME. SO, HOW LONG DID SHE WAIT BEFORE SHE LET HIM, YOU KNOW, MAKE HIS MOVE? OH, CHARLOTTE WAITED FOR YOU. WE ALL WAITED. SHE WAITED FOR YEARS. THEN SHE GOT FED UP AND SUED FOR DIVORCE BASED ON ABANDONMENT. SO...YOU DON'T GET THE RIGHT TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. OH, COME ON, MA, YOU GOT TO ADMIT, I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF CRAZY. SHE'S GONNA END UP WITH MY BROTHER? SHE COULD HAVE HAD ANY MAN SHE WANTED. THE ONE SHE USEDTO WANT ACTED THE FOOL AND PRETTY MUCH MESSED UP. I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU THEN. YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT THAT. I KIND OF CRACKED YOUR LITTLE CODE THERE. [ LAUGHS ] YOU THINK THEY'RE IN LOVE? IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY. I DO KNOW ONE THING, THOUGH. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, JAMES GOT A CALL FROM A UNIVERSITY IN GERMANY, OFFERING HIM SOME BIG JOB TO TEACH FOR ONE SEMESTER. HE TURNED IT DOWN. WHY? SO HE COULD STAY CLOSE TO HER? SAID HE WANTED TO BE HOME WITH HIS FAMILY AND NOT ACCEPT ALL THE MONEY THEY WERE OFFERING HIM. YEAH, RIGHT. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH HIS FAMILY. HE WANTED TO BE WITH HER. WELL, I WOULD HAVE, IF I WERE HIM. [ CHUCKLES ] DID YOUR DAD GIVE YOU THIS? HE SAID I CAN KEEP IT. THAT WAS NICE OF HIM. HI. HI. YOU OKAY? I'M FINE. WELL, WHY -- WHY YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT? I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING, THAT'S ALL. ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT? NO. [ CHUCKLES ] OH. LET'S GET MARRIED. WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? UM, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M DOING THIS ALL WRONG. JAMES, WAIT. GET UP. NO, NO, I'M NOT GETTING UP. I'M NOT GETTING UP, OKAY? NOW...I REALIZE THAT THIS IS A LITTLE CLUMSY... [ SIGHS ] THIS IS MY FIRST PROPOSAL, AND I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, SO JUST BEAR WITH ME. CHARLOTTE... WILL YOU PLEASE MARRY ME? I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. IT'S JUST... ...THINGS ARE VERY COMPLICATED. CAN I THINK ABOUT IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE? WELL, THAT'S -- THAT'S NOT A "NO," IS IT? IT'S NOT A "NO." [ SIGHS ] WELL, YOU TAKE ALL THE TIME THAT YOU NEED. DO YOU KNOW WHAT AN AMAZING MAN YOU ARE? OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE, YOU KNOW, YOU BETTER MAKE A DECISION FAST 'CAUSE I COULD GET SCOOPED UP. I WILL, I PROMISE. I WILL NOT... KEEP YOU WAITING, WALTER. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] OH, EXCUSE ME. WALTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT THINGS? WELL, YOU AND MY BROTHER, FOR STARTERS. WALTER, YOU ARE AT MY JOB. WE CAN'T DISCUSS THAT HERE. YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE, MAYBE I'M NOT THE ONE TO TALK ON CERTAIN THINGS, BUT -- THEN DON'T TALK. YOU HAVE CAUSED ENOUGH CHAOS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN BACK. CHARLOTTE, MY OFFICE. NOW. OKAY. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER. LISTEN, SINCE YOU'RE HERE, MAYBE YOU CAN WATCH ANDY FOR A LITTLE WHILE. HE'S WIPED OUT. I'M MAKING YOU A PUZZLE. IT'S A HARD ONE. HOW COME I NEVER SEE YOU HAVE FUN? IT'S NICE OUTSIDE. I AM HAVING FUN. YOUR MOTHER'S GONNA BE BUSY FOR A WHILE. COME ON. COME WITH ME. WHERE ARE WE GOING? WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO? I WANT TO GO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. WELL, WE'LL GO SOMEWHERE, OKAY? HEY, SHAWN. HEY, ANDY. WHAT'S UP? HI. HEY. ANDY SAID WE'D PROBABLY FIND HER OUT HERE. OH, YEAH, SHE'S ALWAYS DOWN HERE, EVEN DURING SCHOOL. WIN TWO STATES IN A ROW, THEY PRETTY MUCH LET YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. YEAH, I KNOW THAT FEELING. [ LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE ] HEY. YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO HANG AROUND FOR THIS. OH, IT'S OKAY. I DON'T MIND. WHAT ARE DOING HERE, LITTLE BOY? DADDY BROUGHT ME. HEY. TAKE HIM HOME. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE CAME A LONG WAY TO SEE YOU. DIDN'T WE, ANDY? STOP USING HIM TO GET AT ME. I'M NOT USING -- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS. OH, REALLY? WELL, THEN, WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT? WELL, I -- I JUST BOUGHT US SOME LUNCH. I THOUGHT -- WELL, ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING WE COULD JUST SIT DOWN AND TALK FOR A WHILE, THAT'S ALL. IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT. HEY, HAVE HIM TAKE YOU HOME 'CAUSE HE'S NOT GONNA LISTEN TO ME. OKAY. SORRY. HEY. GO EAT YOUR LUNCH. ALL RIGHT. Shawn: I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AND EVERYTHING, BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY TALK TO HIM IF I WERE YOU, YOU KNOW? HE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU. IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'RE NOT ME. LOOK, DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUT WHY DO YOU THINK HE KEEPS COMING AROUND, EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM? I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN. MAYBE HE'S MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME. WHERE ELSE IS HE SUPPOSED TO START? YOU GOT ABOUT TWO SECONDS TO TELL ME WHOSE SIDE YOU'RE ON. I DON'T NEED TWO SECONDS, OKAY? I'M ON YOUR SIDE. YOU CAN'T BE MAD AT HIM FOR LEAVING AND BE MAD AT HIM FOR COMING BACK. DON'T TELL ME HOW TO FEEL. BUT DEEP DOWN, I KNOW YOU WANT HIM TO KEEP CHASING AFTER YOU SO YOU CAN KEEP SLAMMING THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. AM I RIGHT? I MEAN, HOW ELSE ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO HURT HIM THE WAY HE HURT YOU? AND, YEAH, IF YOU DO IT ENOUGH TIMES, HE'S GONNA SAY, "HEY, SHE DOESN'T WANT ME ANYMORE." AND THEN HE'S GONNA LEAVE AGAIN. AND THEN YOU GET TO BLAME HIM FOR THAT. IT'S NEVER GONNA END. SO YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, OKAY, BUT I HAVE PLAYED EVERY DADDY GAME YOU COULD THINK OF. BELIEVE ME. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [ SIGHS ] SO, DO YOU MISS PLAYING FOOTBALL? Walter: NOT REALLY. IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO LAST FOREVER. THEN WHY'D YOU DO IT? 'CAUSE IT MADE MY FATHER HAPPY. YOU SEE, THE MORE FAMOUS I GOT, THE MORE HE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT ME. THAT ALL CHANGED THE DAY I BLEW OUT MY KNEE. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL STILL THEN. I REMEMBER HE TOLD ME, UH... [ LAUGHS ] HE SAID I HAD BLOWN THE ONE OPPORTUNITY I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL. SO I SPENT THE NEXT FEW YEARS TRYING TO PROVE HIM WRONG, BUT NOTHING I DID EVER SEEMED TO WORK OUT. I REMEMBER SEEING YOU ON TV ONE DAY, PLAYING A BIG GAME. YOU SCORED THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN, AND EVERYBODY WAS GOING CRAZY. I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL THEN, BUT... I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW PROUD I WAS THAT YOU WERE MY FATHER. SEE? THAT'S -- THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD THAT REACTION TO ME. THAT WAS MY PROBLEM. NO, NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT'S NOT WHY I WAS PROUD OF YOU. I WAS PROUD BECAUSE AFTER THAT GAME -- AFTER ALL THOSE PEOPLE MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT YOU -- YOU STILL MADE IT HOME TO PUT ME TO BED THAT NIGHT AND READ ME A STORY. I NEVER CARED THAT YOU WERE A BIG FOOTBALL STAR. I ONLY CARED THAT YOU MADE ME FEEL MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THOSE CHEERING PEOPLE IN THE STANDS. HEY, GRAB A SEAT. A FEW MONTHS AFTER I LEFT, IT WAS YOUR 10th BIRTHDAY. I KNOW YOU HAD A PARTY THAT DAY AND THAT YOU WORE YOUR FAVORITE DRESS -- BLUE-AND-WHITE STRIPED ONE. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? WELL, YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S BEEN FILLING ME IN ON A FEW THINGS THAT I MISSED SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE. THAT'S HOW I KNOW YOU SAVED ME SOME OF YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE. I BET YOU IT WAS CHOCOLATE WITH CHOCOLATE FROSTING 'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY KIND YOU LIKED. YOU WRAPPED THAT CAKE UP, AND YOU WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY TOUCH IT. IT JUST SAT THERE TILL YOU FINALLY TOLD YOUR MOTHER TO THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I WASN'T COMING BACK FOR IT. NOT FOR THE CAKE... AND NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE, THER. I'M SORRY I MISSED YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY, DENISE. YEAH, WELL... IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW. [ BAG RUSTLES ] HERE. I, UH... ...I'D LIGHT IT, BUT I DON'T HAVE A MATCH. I-I'M SORRY. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT 10 ANYMORE. I-I-I KNOW THAT. I... BUT YOU'RE STILL MY DAUGHTER. TO BE HONEST, ALL THE MISTAKES I'VE MADE, I NEVER STOPPED LOVING YOU -- NOT FOR ONE MINUTE. I DON'T THINK I NEED YOU NOW. HMM, YEAH, WELL... FOR THE LONGEST TIME, I DIDN'T THINK YOU NEEDED ME. DENISE, LOOK AT ME. IT'S KILLING ME, KNOWING THAT I MISSED HALF YOUR LIFE AND MOST OF YOUR BROTHER'S. BY CHOICE. YEAH, OKAY. BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT UP TO YOU IF YOU WON'T LET ME. WELL... AT LEAST YOU CAN ADMIT WHEN YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING. I CAN'T EVEN GET MOM TO DO THAT. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, WELL... NEITHER COULD I. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU SURE YOU WANT HIM TO STAY HERE? YEAH. HE'LL BE FINE. OKAY, UM, I GUESS I SHOULD GET GOING THEN. OKAY. LISTEN, HE USUALLY SLEEPS THROUGH THE NIGHT, BUT YOU SHOULD STAY WITH HIM JUST IN CASE 'CAUSE -- DENISE... HE'LL BE FINE. I'LL TAKE OF HIM, I PROMISE. OKAY. SO... I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU LATER? YEP. YOU WILL. WOW. [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THIS. OH, YEAH. IT'S MY FAVORITE PICTURE OF THE TWO OF YOU. DID GRANDMA DIG IT OUT FOR YOU? NO. HOW'D YOU FIND IT, THEN? I DIDN'T FIND IT. I TOOK THIS WITH ME WHEN I LEFT. AND I HAVE THIS PICTURE EVERYWHERE I GO. GOOD NIGHT. [ PEARL MUMBLING ] [ KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING ] WHAT YOU DOING, GRANDMA? WHAT IS A SIX-LETTER WORD FOR "ANGEL"? UM... I HAVE NO IDEA. HONESTLY... I DON'T KNOW HOW YOUR BROTHER COMES UP WITH THESE THINGS. NEITHER DO I. I GAVE UP TRYING TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT A LONG TIME AGO. [ SIGHS ] WELL... LOOKS LIKE YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE GETTING CLOSER TOGETHER, HMM? HMM? YEAH. YEAH, A LITTLE, I GUESS. HE MIGHT NOT BE AS BAD AS I BUILT HIM UP TO BE IN MY MIND. NOBODY IS. JUST REMEMBER THAT. YEAH. I WILL. [ SIGHS ] HEY, ANDY'S GONNA SPEND THE NIGHT. OKAY. IS JAMES IN THERE? NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. COME ON, GET IN. [ DIALING ] IS SOMETHING WRONG? EVERYTHING'S FINE. WELL, THEN CAN WE GO? IN A SECOND. James: This is James. I'm not here. Leave a message. OKAY, I GET IT. I GET IT. IS THERE, LIKE, SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND UNCLE JAMES? IT DOESN'T MATTER, SWEETHEART. ALL RIGHT, YOU NEED TO GIVE ME MY PHONE BACK. DENISE, LOOK AT MY FACE. DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M IN THE MOOD TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AGAIN? I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, MOM. JUST LET ME SEE IT. PLEASE, JUST FOR A SECOND. I'LL GIVE IT RIGHT BACK. OKAY. HURRY UP. YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO GET A MAN TO ANSWER HIS PHONE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M CALLING HIM. WHEN HE SEES IT'S MY NUMBER, HE'LL PICK IT UP. HE ALWAYS DOES. Hello? UNCLES JAMES. HI, IT'S ME. What's up? HEY, LISTEN, I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING, BUT HOLD ON A SECOND. I'M GONNA TRY AND GET A BETTER SIGNAL. Okay. HI. [ Click, dial tone ] WHAT DID HE SAY? NOTHING. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] WELL, WE TRIED. THANK YOU. IT'S OKAY. I'M JUST SORRY THAT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. SO AM I. ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU DO, ANYWAY? 'CAUSE IF HE'S NOT TALKING TO YOU, IT MUST BE SOMETHING, LIKE, REALLY WRONG. OH, REALLY? [ LAUGHS ] I OPENED MY BIG MOUTH WITHOUT THINKING. OH, THAT MUST BE WHERE IGET IT FROM. YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. [ CHUCKLES ] [ GASPS LIGHTLY ] YES. WHAT'S THE MATTER, ANDY? I HAD A BAD DREAM. YOU WERE GONE AGAIN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. I'M RIGHT HERE. I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU, AND I COULDN'T FIND YOU BECAUSE YOU LEFT AND DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK. YEAH, WELL... OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A DREAM 'CAUSE HERE I AM, RIGHT? ARE YOU GONNA BE HERE WHEN I WAKE UP? OF COURSE I AM. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. GOOD. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO ANYWHERE. SO... WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, HMM? I'M SORRY. WHAT? YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING. WE'VE BEEN SITTING OUT HERE ALL THIS TIME, AND YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD YET. JAMES ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM. [ LAUGHS ] WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? JUST YESTERDAY. HE GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND EVERYTHING. OH, MY! [ BOTH LAUGH ] WELL, YOU KNOW HE WASN'T ALWAYS THE ROMANTIC TYPE, BUT WHERE'S YOUR RING? HE HAD ONE -- TRIED TO GIVE IT TO ME, BUT I TOLD HIM I NEEDED TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT WHAT? I CAN'T MARRY JAMES... AT LEAST NOT YET. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I'M KIND OF STILL MARRIED TO WALTER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. TECHNICALLY, YOU COULD SAY I'M STILL FULLY MARRIED... IN THE LEGAL SENSE, AT LEAST. BUT, CHARLOTTE, HOW CAN THAT BE? I SAW THE DIVORCE PAPERS YOU FILED. NO. YOU SAW THE PAPERS I FILLED OUT. BUT I NEVER FILED THEM. CHARLOTTE! I KNOW. I KNOW. IT'S HORRIBLE, BUT, PEARL, I CAN EXPLAIN. IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR AFTER WALTER LEFT BEFORE I COULD FILE FOR DIVORCE. SO I MET WITH NICOLE AND HAD HER DRAW UP THE PAPERS. BUT THEN SOME TIME WENT BY, AND I THOUGHT, "WHAT'S THE POINT?" HE WAS GONE. HE WASN'T COMING BACK. AND OUR MARRIAGE WAS OVER IN EVERY WAY THAT REALLY MATTERED. THE PAPERWORK JUST SEEMED LIKE A FORMALITY. I DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER GET MARRIED AGAIN, ANYWAY, SO I JUST GOT ON WITH MY LIFE. AND THEN JAMES COMES ALONG. IT JUST NEVER SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT TIME TO BRING IT UP. ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE WITH WALTER? IS THAT THE REAL REASON WHY YOU NEVER FILED THE PAPERS? NO. NO, PEARL, JAMES IS THE ONE. TELL HIM EVERYTHING. EXPLAIN IT TO HIM JUST LIKE YOU EXPLAINED IT TO ME. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THAT, PEARL. I'D GIVE HIM MORE CREDIT THAN THAT. IF HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO CATCH YOU, HE'LL BE SMART ENOUGH TO WANT TO KEEP YOU. [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE HERE. OH, PEARL, I CAN'T DO THIS YET. PROBABLY CAN DO MUCH MORE THAN YOU THINK. JUST START TALKING. [ UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING ] [ DRILL WHIRRING ] [ MAN SINGING IN SPANISH ] [ MUSIC STOPS ] HEY. YOU'RE STARING. I KNOW. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU FIX ANYTHING IN MY LIFE. OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, I-I CAN BE PRETTY HANDY WHEN I WANT TO BE. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT IS. I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN YOU WANT TO BEFORE. [ CHUCKLES ] HEY, CHARLOTTE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID A WHILE AGO THAT -- DON'T SAY IT. I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO HEAR IT, BUT I DON'T. OKAY. THAT'S FAIR, BUT, UH... I STILL NEED TO SAY IT. LISTEN, I, UM -- LOOK, I KNOW I TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I LEFT, BUT I REALIZED I NEVER... APOLOGIZED TO YOU. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY. I REALLY AM. THANK YOU. ANYWAY, I'M SURE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW. YOU'LL GET YOUR FATHER'S MONEY, AND YOU'LL BE FREE TO GO. I FIGURED YOU'D BE PACKING BY NOW. [ SCOFFS ] SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN A RUSH TO SEE ME LEAVE. YEAH, I THINK I AM. [ LAUGHS ] OUCH. OKAY. [ DRILL WHIRRING ] BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. IT'S OKAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. I JUST NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME. YOU NEED TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND. I HAVE. WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE WITH WALTER, THEN THAT'S WHO YOU SHOULD REALLY BE WITH. THANKS FOR PUTTING UP SUCH A FIGHT. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM ME, CHARLOTTE? YOU WERE MARRIED TO THE MAN. YOU'VE GOT TWO KIDS. I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT. THIS ISN'T A COMPETITION. I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID. IF I COULD TAKE IT BACK, I WOULD. BUT YOU CAN'T. I NEED YOU TO TRY TO LISTEN TO ME AS MY FRIEND 'CAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU. [ METAL CLINKS ] YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE WAY MY MARRIAGE ENDED. A LOT OF THINGS NEVER GOT RESOLVED, AND I FIGURED IF I JUST DIDN'T DEAL WITH IT, EVERYTHING WOULD WORK ITSELF OUT. BUT I WAS WRONG. I KNOW YOU STILL WANT TO BE WITH HIM. I DON'T. THAT'S THE TRUTH. THE REAL REASON WHY I DIDN'T ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE A FEW YEARS BACK... ...I DIDN'T FILE THE DIVORCE PAPERS. WHAT? I NEVER FILED. YOU'RE MARRIED? WE ARE DIVORCED IN EVERY WAY EXCEPT ON PAPER. JAMES, I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. NEITHER DO I. [ SIGHS ] WHY DID YOU REALLY COME BACK HERE, WALTER? HUH? I WANT TO KNOW. I MEAN -- I MEAN, WERE YOU OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, SAYING, "YOU KNOW, MAYBE I DIDN'T DAMAGE MY FAMILY ENOUGH "BY RUNNING OUT ON THEM. I SHOULD -- I SHOULD GO BACK AND DISRUPT THEIR WORLD EVEN MORE." YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND, JAMES? YOU GAVE ALL THIS UP, AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BACK! 'CAUSE THAT WOULD JUST KILL YOU, WOULDN'T IT? YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO PROTECT THIS FAMILY, AND YOU COMING BACK AFTER SIX YEARS -- ALL YOU'RE DOING IS -- IS RIPPING OPEN OLD WOUNDS! WHY IS IT THAT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE COOL WITH ME BEING BACK HERE EXCEPT YOU? BECAUSE WHEN YOU DISAPPEAR AGAIN -- OH, AND WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU WILL -- THEY'LL STILL HAVE ME TO DEPEND ON. BUT I'M TIRED, MAN. I'M TIRED OF CLEANING UP AFTER YOUR MESSES. I'M TIRED OF BEING THE -- THE STABLE, DEPENDABLE ONE WHO IS HERE FOR THE EVERYDAY WORK WHILE YOU'RE OFF DOING WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO! SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, JAMES, HUH? I OWE YOU SOMETHING? I'M SAYING THAT A REAL MAN TAKES CARE OF HIS OWN NO MATTER WHAT HE HAS TO DO. THAT'S WHAT I DO, AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN HANDLE THE SACRIFICES I'VE MADE! YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET YOU. NO, SEE, LOOK. LOOK -- NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE, MAN. YOU ARE WEAK, WALTER, AND YOU CAN'T EVEN FACE UP TO WHAT YOU REALLY ARE. ALL THOSE FEARS YOU HAD ABOUT BEING A FAILURE, WELL THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE BECOME. YOU ARE A FAILURE, AND YOU KNOW IT, AND I KNOW IT, AND THE KIDS KNOW IT. MAN, DENISE REMEMBERS YOU WALKING OUT! AND ANDY -- HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW, TO UNDERSTAND, THAT HIS OWN FATHER DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HIM! [ GRUNTS ] WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?! I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU. NONE OF US DO. I'M OUT OF HERE TOMORROW. GOOD! IF EVERYONE'S READY, WE CAN GET STARTED. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T AWARE, MR. CLEMONS HAS INCLUDED A FORFEITURE CLAUSE IN HIS WILL. THIS MEANS THAT IF ANY ONE OF YOU WERE TO CONTEST THE WILL IN ANY WAY, INCLUDING ANY ASPECT OF OR EVEN THE VALIDITY OF THE WILL, YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED AS A BENEFICIARY AND LEFT WITH NOTHING. THESE WERE HIS EXPRESS WISHES, AND IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS. WELL, CAN HE DO THAT? I MEAN, I-I'M JUST ASKING. I'M NOT CONTESTING ANYTHING -- JUST ASKING. "I, JAMES ANDREW CLEMONS SR., "BEING OF SOUND MIND AND MEMORY, REVOKE ALL PRIOR WILLS "AND PUBLISH THE FOLLOWING AS MY LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT. "TO MY WIFE OF 62 YEARS, PEARL MAY CLEMONS, "I GIVE THE SUM OF $380,000. "TO MY YOUNGEST SON, JAMES ANDREW CLEMONS JR., I GIVE THE AMOUNT OF $90,000."

"AND FINALLY, TO MY ELDEST SON, WALTER KENNEDY CLEMONS, "I LEAVE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ENVELOPE, WHICH CONTAINS THE GREATEST GIFT I HAVE TO GIVE." WHAT'S THIS? THAT'S YOUR INHERITANCE, WALTER. THISIS WHAT HE LEFT ME? WHAT IS THIS -- SOME KIND OF JOKE? IT'S NOT A JOKE. THIS IS WHAT HE BROUGHT ME BACK HERE FOR, HUH? SLAP ME IN THE FACE ONE MORE TIME, AND I JUST WALKED RIGHT INTO IT, DIDN'T I? WALTER, SIT DOWN. WHAT FOR? BECAUSE I ASKED YOU TO, PLEASE. WHY, MA, SO WE CAN PRETEND THAT I BELONG HERE, HUH? WILL THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER? I DON'T BELONG HERE. HE JUST SHOWED ME THAT. [ VEHICLE APPROACHES ] [ CAR DOOR OPENS ] I MADE IT BACK HERE BEFORE I REALIZED NOBODY EVER GAVE ME A KEY. YEAH, WELL, YOU NEVER ASKED FOR ONE. YEAH, WELL, IF YOU LET ME IN, I'LL PACK AND BE OUT OF EVERYBODY'S WAY. [ CHUCKLES ] I FIGURED YOU'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT, JAMES, AS USUAL. YOU KNOW... IT'S TOO BAD DADDY WASN'T HERE TODAY. HE WOULD HAVE HAD A BIG LAUGH. NOTHING MADE HIM HAPPIER THAN SEEING ME FALL ON MY FACE. WALTER, YOU NEED TO STOP BEING SO ANGRY WITH YOUR FATHER. I GOT TO PACK. YOU DON'T WANT TO FORGET THIS. IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE AGAIN, THERE WILL BE NO COMING BACK. HOW COME IT FEELS LIKE I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A MONTH? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ONLY BEEN A DAY. WANT TO GET IN? GUESS WE'RE NOT FIGHTING ANYMORE. NO. I GUESS WE'RE NOT FIGHTING ANYMORE. GOOD. BUT DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO LET YOU OFF THE HOOK THAT EASILY. YOU SAID SOME PRETTY MEAN THINGS TO ME. YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SLIPPING AWAY, AND I, UH -- I WAS JUST TRYING MY HARDEST NOT TO CARE. YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH WALTER, I'LL STEP ASIDE. JAMES, THAT IS THE LAST THING I WANT. GOOD. 'CAUSE I-I DIDN'T MEAN A WORD I JUST SAID. YOU DIDN'T? [ Chuckling ] NO -- NOT THE PART ABOUT WALTER. OKAY. HE'D HAVE TO FIGHT ME FOR YOU, AND HE WOULD -- HE WOULD LOSE, CHARLOTTE, 'CAUSE I REFUSE TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU. YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE? NO. I'D LIKE TO STAY OUT HERE. YEAH, THAT'S MY VOTE, TOO. [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] [ ZIPPER ZIPS ] GO AHEAD, GIVE IT TO HIM. HEY. WHAT IS IT, ANDY? [ Voice breaking ] DON'T GO. I HAVE TO. HOW COME? [ SIGHS ] IT'S KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN. HE'S NOT STAYING, ANDY, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET ANY MONEY. GO ON, TELL HIM THE TRUTH SO I DON'T HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM WHY HIS FATHER CHOSE MONEY OVER HIS SON'S LOVE. COME ON, ANDY, GIVE IT TO HIM. WE GOT TO GO. THIS IS FOR YOU. I PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. YEAH, YOU DID. HE WOULDN'T LET US TAKE HIM HOME UNTIL HE MADE SURE THAT YOU GOT IT. YOU KNOW, ANDY, MAN, THIS IS -- THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE GOTTEN IN A LONG TIME. IF I GAVE YOU SOME MONEY, WOULD YOU STAY? WHAT? ANDY. ANDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PUT YOUR MONEY BACK IN YOUR POCKET. I HAVE $33 -- $33.50. ANDY, TAKE YOUR MONEY. [ Sobbing ] I DON'T WANT IT. I WANT YOU. YOU CAN HAVE EVERYTHING IF YOU JUST STAY. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. LOOK, ANDY, I'M GONNA HAVE YOUR SISTER TAKE YOU HOME, OKAY? WHY DO YOU KEEP LEAVING? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ME. WHY DID YOU BRING HIM HERE?! BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO SEE THIS. I HAD TO SIT THROUGH IT ONCE, SO NOW IT'S HIS TURN. I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT US. EVERYTHING THAT YOU WERE DOING ALL THIS TIME WAS JUST A LIE. YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST GO. JUST GO. AND PLEASE DON'T COME BACK HERE SIX MORE BIRTHDAYS FROM NOW WITH ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR STUPID CUPCAKES AND CANDLES WITH NO MATCHES. I'M NOT FALLING FOR THAT STUFF AGAIN. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] I NEED A RIDE. IT'S THE LAST THING I'LL ASK FROM YOU. [ SIGHS ] [ CAR DOORS CLOSE ] [ SIGHS ] YOU SURE YOU WANT THEM TO REMEMBER YOU LIKE THIS? WHO SAYS I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED? [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] OKAY. [ SIGHS ] WHICH WAY? LOOK, I REALLY DON'T CARE WHERE I'M TAKING YOU BECAUSE I DON'T EXPECT TO EVER SEE YOU AGAIN. I JUST NEED TO KNOW -- AM I TAKING A RIGHT OR A LEFT HERE? MY SON TRIED TO BRIBE ME. YEAH, WELL, HE'S A FAST LEARNER, AND YOU'RE TEACHING HIM THAT YOUR LOVE CAN BE BOUGHT. THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY, JAMES. YOU JUST GOT HANDED 90 GRAND. I GOT NOTHING. BUT YOU HAVE EVERYTHING, AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND. THE TRUTH IS, I JUST WANTED THE MONEY FOR THEM. IT WAS MY ONE CHANCE TO... YOU KNOW, FINALLY DO SOMETHING RIGHT. I COULDN'T EVEN MANAGE THAT. WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MONEY, WALTER? THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT FROM YOU. [ Voice breaking ] YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW... I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE THE KIND OF FATHER THEY NEED, MAN. JAMES, I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT. AND DO YOU WANT THEM TO FEEL THE WAY DADDY MADE YOU FEEL? [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] NO, NO! STAY HERE. LET HIM COME TO YOU. GIVE YOUR FATHER A CHANCE. LET HIM GO. DAD! HEY. I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE COMING BACK. YEAH, WELL, ME EITHER. WAIT, I NEED TO GO GET YOUR MONEY. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, COME HERE. LISTEN TO ME. I CAME BACK HERE FOR YOU. HUH? IT'S ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, MA. YOU BETTER SAY SOMETHING. YOU GOT US OUT HERE WITH ALL OUR BUSINESS IN THE STREET. COME ON NOW. THIS IS MY FAMILY. I... THIS IS WHERE I BELONG. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. NEVER? NO. NEVER. DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID? DENISE? HEY. I-I NEED YOU TO WANT ME TO STAY. [ Voice breaking ] I ALWAYS WANTED YOU. [ CRYING ] YEAH! YEAH. HEY. HOW'D I DO? YES! THAT WAS GOOD! [ ALL TALKING ] NO, NO, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
