PRO to an NGO initiative there. That means, Through Iiteracy promotions and rural development initiatives.. They increase the standard of Iiving of the rural folk in Canada... Make townships in not so densely populated regions ...and make people migrate gradually to the townships. These are their programmes... The hidden agenda is to boost the parent companies' business. Sudhi. Only couples can migrate in this scheme Is it? Last time, there was a domestic migration program. To migrate people Iiving in other places in Canada, to this place.. We tried doing that. But none of them were ready to Ieave their present Iiving atmosphere .. Any other preparations required? Not much.. The selected couples will have to go through one week training. Is it enough that one in the couple passes the English Ianguage test? They said there will be a processing charge. How much will be that? 10 Iakhs Indian rupees for each couple. We will fund the balance amount. As you are funded immigrants, you cannot Ieave canada for the next 14 years. Today we are applying. Since we have paid enough bribe, we will get it in two or three days. Nly parents' business flopped. They are facing coun cases now. Ifl stay here morel may also have to appear in the coun as legal heir. I Iove her so much. We need a good Iife. Can't do it here at home. Family, relatives and even religion may hun us. So we have no other go. Charu, Did you tell your mother about the cash? Tell her that you got a scholarship to study there. Just for a year ortwo. Her mother Ioves her so much. Isn't it the same with all of us? Charu.. Cheer up.. There is no other option. You know how much I struggled to make 4 Iakhs. I know... But... Please. Take it.. Very tasty? Is it the honey jackfruit, uncle? No..it is tastierthan this. If you eat jackfruits continuously for four months in a year you will not get diabetes. Same with cancer. True? Why doubt? Fony years ago we had almost no diabetics around. Look at me...I am above 70. When I was admitted in hospital last time „tests were done many times and there is not even a hint of diabetes. But you had a hean attack! That was because I had to take so many tablets in the medical camps. Just for the doctors to make money. AnyWaV» Anyway, I will take seeds of these jackfruits when I go to Canada. Won'tjackfruits grow in cold climate, uncle? Not jackfruits but...jackfruit trees. Whatever grows here at our home, won't grow anywhere else. Is there any other place as beautiful as ours? Isn't it enough to study in colleges here? Even othenuise, what son of studies you will get in Canada that you don't get here. You won't understand all those. It was foolish of me to admit you in the hostel for studies. Some hopes these rich guys have!! Big mouthfuls often choke, Charu. Then...To avoid chokes, we can struggle Iike this forever.. Try this..supertaste I don't want. What happened? Pack my things at the hostel. Mama will come and collect it. I am not coming to the college or hostel any more. You call me when you go, afterfood. I have a headache. Let me sleep for awhile. Charu's mother.. Don't take this as a silly wish of Charu. I'::::,'::;°:,äzääfläfimii. If we don't utilize it, God may not be that kind always... For a family Iike yours this is a great fonune. If you wish your child to have a great future... you should Iet her go to Canada. You don't have to pay any fees there is scholarship also. M5 Sfifißhfiähflfixm, she may be able to send some cash home also. She doesn't have to do that. She should be happy there and study well. But.. How can she be there alone and so far...?! M maflayaflfis Uflwflmg] Some girls go there after paying 25 to 30 Iakhs. Since we passed this test, we have to pay much Iess. It is only because of her Iuck. Mm m Charu didn't tell you? No. You will have to give 6 Iakhs. That can be recouped in just a couple of years. I think it is a good proposal, sister. Not only that she can study but she will definitely get a placement there .. The salary is not Iike ours. Her Iife will be secured in five years. You should change that onhodox attitude... that your daughter is crossing the ocean and all that. You know about me. Only because ofthe concern daddy has towards grandma... ...I am hanging onto thejob here. Daddy and Kichu are taking only the same effons in London. But they earn ten times more than whatl earn here I feel that you should Iet her go. But..Vini..From where can I find 6 Iakhs? Thinking of that.. It is not that easy for you, sister. But, Iet us try. Like a bank Ioan.. There will be some way out. I don't know. I told herl would try.. My dearVini..it is Iike carrying a fifty Kg weight on my head. Don't get tensed. Go to sleep We will talk about it tomorrow. Ok Vini. Can we make that son of money..Dear? At times, Iife is also Iike that. It takes us to unthinkable and horrible situations. We would be shocked..howto face itl! We might even retreat. But if one decides to face it and gets ready to do anything for it... You can send your daughter not to Canada but even to Mars.. Be courageous and go ahead. Take this. Sir. It is 35000 rupees. I have only this much now. Iwill try ifl can manage more. The present rules don't provide for an education Ioan for studies abroad. Then, do you have any Ianded propeny? Then we can arrange a mongage Ioan. Still, there is a problem. Your repayment capacity. What is your salary? I will stand as a guarantee too. Ok..Let us see. What this branch can do is Rs. 3 Iakhs at the most. Let me see the documents of your propeny. Ok Sir. Ok. Thanks. No cantankerous woman Iike your mother would have taken binh on eanh. Your daug hter has inherited her character. You used to draw pictures well. This was just a one room tenement those days. You used to show me this drawing and tell me, ÄüPapa Iet us make a house Iike this'. That Ionging was fulfilled after so many years. That too step by step. By that time you grew old. You quit drawing. If you hadn't drawn this, we would not be having this house to hypothecate now. Ifl knewthis then, I would have drawn a two storied house. I think it is in that. Yes..This is the one. Nayanar was the Chief Minister at that time. Your mother and I went to the meeting in the road junction to get the papers. When your mother prostrated in front, he raised her up ...and said that soon he would arrange money for the house also. That was also given aftenNards. Through the panchayath. She used to pay the taxes punctually till she Ieft. Now, there must be arrears. This is not enough. The original document. And the document before that... No encumbrance cenificate, heir ship cenificate and Iocation sketch too. We need all these papers. You can get these from the village office. Hello I am here I sawyou. Look here... Towards the ATM. Did you see? Yes. Ok Ok I will come there. Why? Gopalaettan's daughter is going to buy a house? No..Member. We have to get all these papers for our house immediately. For a Ioan? We have only all these papers. What can we do with this? This is the title deed awarded by the Govt. Not of much imponance. Not only that, your mother is not alive. °°:,"„"::";:322:;':„*':e::::::':i;:r:°"" Then how can we get all the documents noted here? Member... If you can help.. No way ..Child. It is easierto become the Prime Minister of India than to make proper documents for this property. Not only that..if someone complains about this, the Iand itself may disappear. How is it? We are staying there since so many years. Yes..That is whatl am talking about. You just stayed there without doing things that should have been done from time to time. You have to remind that you are staying in the Iand, that has a title deed given by govt. ...Paying taxes, and the Iand area is so much in the resurvey. Rem ind whom? The government. Othenmse, such a Iand would not even exist in the official documents. That is the problem.. How can a Iand which is there just disappear, Sir? Don't call me sir. You can call me Dilipetta. Take it as an advice .. If possible sell the Iand to some rich guy and secure yourself. That is safe. Rich people will make some resorts and gradually make the documents proper .. If we go behind this, it will take at least 10 years. I am sure. Sister.. Sister..Drink this. Who is that, Sister? Nly daughter. Pick it. Dear... Mam a.. I am coming from the passpon office. Things are ok there I will get it the day aftertomorrow. Didn't you have to pay forthe passpon? Nly friends helped me for the time being. We applied in the addressof Harsha. They paid it all together. How are things, Mama I am trying my best. Fifteenth is nearing Mama. Others are all ready with cash. They are all waiting for me. I am trying Charu. Nothing can Substitute money. I will call you. Have you reached the hostel? Almost. Ok. Will your mom cheat...? Sudhi... Your mom and dad are into some problems and my mother is struggling now!! I said something due to my tension... Tension..Everyone has that. I am reeling under afeeling ofguilt. So, what about me who is Ieaving my parents in such a pathetic state? I wish for a Iife with you Charu.. That is my reason too.. I don't Iike you blaming my mother. Sorry. Sorry.. You go.. I have to go to the hostel I tried talking to daddy. But there is some problem there Iike status change or something Iike that. No bank transactions will take place fortwo, three months. He told me he would transfer some amount tomorrow by moneygram. Did he ask the details Iike forwhom etc.? I told him it is for a friend. Twenty five thousand mig ht come. Adding that with money in my account it Will be 50000 I have to get money from some homes. For milk. If we add all that with the money from MN sir also, it will be around 100000 only. You have one Iakh from nothing. Another five Iakhs.. Bank Ioan won't come through. Shall we borrow from a moneylenders? For high interests? Who will give so much money, Vinitha. Let us try.. Let us try..l know a person. You don't mind getting a bit Iate, No? Oh..There is still time for the bus. Then, com e. Akbar Bhai...? He went to the mosque. Will be right back. Sit down. Have you been waiting since Iong? No..Akbar Bhai..Just ten mins. Do you still read Arabic books regularly. Have lost touch with the Iangauge. That won't do. Arabic is one superior Ianguage in the world Iike your Samskritham. But you should be always in touch. I have IearntArabic. Bhai was my teacher. He is a scholar. Four post g rad uatio ns and two doctorates. AIIah.. He is above all studies. What is greater than knowing Him!! Our interest rate is now 96 per cent. Eight per month. It doesn't matter. We can help such poor people who don't get Ioan from banks. Isn't it? We don't do business with women. Butl can't say 'no' to this girl.. You bring the documents of the Iand. I can tell you howmuch I can give you, ...only after Iooking at the documents. It is a Iittle away from here. Around 10 to 15 Kms. That doesn't matter. You have a house there, No? Don't they live there? Yes. We only check that. Anyone who hypothecates the house will be serious in paying backthe Ioan. OthenNiSe won't the house be mine? So..Let us. Ok..Bye. How can such believers charge such high interest rates? May be God has told him. Who knows. God may be doing the same business therel! I told you.. Our company has no such policy. Since I understood your Situation. ...I just asked... No way.,. I am sorry. Sir.. Deduct my full salary till the Ioan is paid back. Can you ask Iike that? You won't understand..ls it? This is an American com pany. Get paid according to your work. That is the system here. That is the system here. Is it? What? Sir..PF and gratuity are cut from our salary. Can't she withdraw that? You can do that. Your employee code? Tell me your employee code. SW004 lt comes only to 72600. Not only that. Full withdrawal is possible only when you resign or are terminated. Then, if you resign, you will get another 25000 from the com pany. Sir.. Can you appoint her afresh after she resigns? You can't even apply to any branch of the company forthe next one year. Think about it and decide. 0h..You were here? I thought you submitted the resignation and Ieft. Sister .. How can you pull on by selling milk and eggs? IhmmwgJmm No other way, Vini. Ifl can getjob in households as cook I can earn about 5000 a month. Still..You should have thought one more time before giving the Ietter. Määüfiämflam If we don't pay before fifteenth... ...she said she would also join me as a house maid. Isn't it tenth today? Has she decided on the date of depanure? Yes.. The flight is from Chennai on 31st. She has to Ieave from here on the 29th. Sister..What is this? We made a decision. Why do you brood over it again? The money from here makes it 2 Iakhs. Will the money Iender bhai give another4 Iakhs? Let us hope. Let us hope. Even if it is three, only one more Iakh will be required I will tell her that we would pay on the fifteenth itself. That day itself I will vacate her from the hostel. I have to feed her well and make her healthy. She Ioo ks weak now. Take this. Ninety seven. The company has to give you 97,600 rupees. I rounded it up and am giving you one Iakh. Thanks Sir. Then..Take this 10000 from me. Take this ...Please. Come here whenever you pass this way.. AII the best. Sir.. You didn't tell me what is my job. You can ask someone outside. What the hell!! How can you be so stupid,.. Vinitha. You want me to give 4 Iakhs on this silly paper? Bhai..Didn't I tell you that day that the documents are not correct? Mmmsa I can't do it. We have to make a hypothecation document with her. On stamp paper. But don't you need at least a document of the Iand? Bhai..it is for her sister's daughter. They have to give the money tomorrow. Please don't cheat us I wanted to help you and I am a cheat now...!! Haven't heard something Iike this before. PIease..Bhai.. Leave the Iand's guarantee. If you trust me, give her the money. Or give methe cash. I will return in six months. With interest. Please, Bhai.. Don't Ieave us. She promised them believing my words. Howmuch do you get novr? 22 thousand I can tell you something which is possible I can Iend you 100,000 on your guarantee. No Bhai..That is not enough. Only that is possible .. Or else you can go. Why? Do you want? Bhai..At least 2. Vinitha.. You are my student... Agreed. But there should be a Iimit forthe risk I take. I told you what I can do. If you want, you have this. And give three signed cheques tomorrowto this Iad here. Thanks Go ahead. We will talk to that travel agent, Sister. We can somehow manage to pay three Iakhs tomorrow. We can tell them that we will pay the balance amount before 28th. Üflcäßxtäfia Will they agree to it? Let us talk to them. I assure you that I will get you anotherten or twelve days more. Daily I handle around twenty-five customers. So, Ieave it to me. You need to think about the balance amount only. There is only one last way out and I will have to do it. Yes.The deal is Iocked. M13 Finally, they have agreed. Pay 17 Iakhs today and submit passpon and other documents. The balance 3 Iakhs should be paid before 11 AM on the 27th. Normally, we don't take such risks. This is because of Miss. Catherine's req uest. If you don't pay on the 17th, ..C1. Means both of you won't go. Ifthat happens, we will ded uct our transaction fee of 50000 rupees ...and pay you only the balance amount. Why did she say that both of you will be out? That..er.. Nlyself and Dina are in the same group. We can go together only. Mm3, M53 Aunty.. Dear.. I don't have to tell you.. I toiled so much to make this money. You have to study well. Com e. Prem..Dude.. Hi ..Vini. Do you work here? Yes. Sister, This is my friend, Prem. You com e. Just a sec...PIease. Don't stay in hostel any more. I have decided to take you home today itself. But Mama..er...College.. I haue to get an assignment sig ned from the college. I will come home in a couple of days after getting that.. Sister. Will you just come with me? Sister... Mama, Mama, Mama, What happened? She was just talking... Vini..Let us go now. These people can manage things here. Can I call an autorikshamf? Who among you paid for Charu's passpon? Is it you? I don't know how much you spent. It is ok aunty..don't mind. It is my daughter's case and it is my responsibility. Papa, Don't think that I don't think about the future when I talk to you. My only aim now is to fulfill Charu's wish. And there is no way out... What is it dear? Are you selling this house? Papa.. Our greatest needs are actually Charu's needs. What is the point in holding on to this Iand if we can't fulfill herwishes? Ifthis makes her future secure, then we should do that. This was where you were born and brought up. It is on this soil that your mother was cremated. But if this soil can bring security to our daughter .. For what else can it be useful? We can rent a small house in city. It is enough, if we get a shed where it doesn't Ieak during rains... and is not too cold for you. Isn't it enough Papa? More than enough.. But, who would buy this house which has no documents? Panchayath member Dilip can help us. He can manage that. Then don't be Iate. Go to him or call him in the morning itself. We don't have much time Ieft. Did you hear? Get the gruel ready. Gopaletta... This much money would be enough for Charumol's studies? Don't sell this house..Papa. Where did you keep this? In the kitchen. Underthe oven. I had kept it aside for Charumol's wedding. Brought it when you were in the hospital. But only 107 rupees were spent. Another 4000 rupees will be there. Charumol requires Iakhs for her studies. You can keep this with yourself. Money will be required any time. Then we have to sell the house? You shouldn't waste your time cleaning cowshed and Iooking after hens.. You should look for a job for him too, Dean Whatever he can do.. Yes..I will do that. I will get the gruel foryou. If we sell the house, what would happen to the cow, calf and hens? Will you sell them too? Now..You sign. Here. Here.. Here too. Now you put your signature. Here 2.5 Iakhs...I counted thrice. You can count again. Give me 50000 more sir. Uwm stäflflflmg] Oh..No I told you that day itself. .You just signed the stamp papers. I have to invest another 2 to 3 Iakhs to make documents proper. Then only I will be able to sell it to the IAS guy staying in the neighborhood. Till then, it is a risk. Member... can we stay here for some more time, as told earlier? Of course. You can stay for two, three orfour weeks .. Are you fine? Prabhu. Mam a.. I don't say that I wouldn't come or I am going back on my commitment..Sudhi. I wanted to enquire whetherwe can extend ourtrip for another couple of months. She sold her house, resigned herjob... ...and borrowed money from wherever possible. Nly poor mother is sending me... Thinking that I am going for higher studies. She doesn't knowthat I am going to live with my partnen. If she knows, any time, thatl cheated her, she will collapse totally. Ifl get one ortwo months, I can convince her that we are in Iove... ...and are going in search of a job. And she might permit me to go. Look..We can settle down there by that time. And you can send money monthly to your mother. Then. Gradually, step by step we can Iet her knowthings. We can make it Iook Iike we have permission from your motherfor marriage. If you want, we can cover the marriage in video and send it to your mother. You can say that you don't get Ieave and thus extend our stay there every year. For all the founeen years, Is it? Though Catherine said Iike that, m mm ...with this company if we pay com pensation. If we get a suitable package, we will jump on to that. And will come home, meet mother I shared my feelings. But you are talking something else. Becmsljlegyec:Ligxzifiägoägfitm e. We are going to Canada, we are going to get settled overthere, ...your mother is getting a better Iife. Just think positively. 0k..Sudhi... I will call you. MN sir? No idea where is he. Hasn't given the key also Is not picking upthe phone. When he comes I will tell him you had come. Whenl called day before yesterday... ...he asked me to come today and said we could manage everything. Give me the phone. I will post a message to him. May be he is busy. Go ahead. What can we do now, Vini? Massage is there. He will call when he sees the message. It is about to stop Iactation. At the most 25000. If it is ok for you I will give you the money in the evening I will deduct the Iabor charges also I told you we would sell it only for 50000. Can't assure you without seeing the cow. Is it a Gulf guy's wedding? You are giving just 25000 for this cow and the big calf? Yes. Cow and the calf together 25,000. Only 10000 forthis alone. This is a good Iactating cow. You knowthat we are in urgent need... Not possible.. I am Johnnychan Kuzhalmannam. I am a publisher. Came here after MN told me. Where is MN sir? Hospitalised after a small accident. He lost his phone too. Will take another three orfour days to be discharged. Asked me to give you this packet. Cas h..50000 rupees. How did you find our house? He told me the Iocation.

And will send a Ietter every month. When I have enough money, I will buy a computerfor you. Then we can see each other and talk..Hm? Don't you think about me. You should knowthat in the new surroundings you are the only person thinking about you. When you get Iot of conveniences and comfons you might get over enthusiastic... Not that you shouldn't have anything foryour happiness.. But only just as much as you need.. After a Iong time, if you feel that you had a happy and meaningful Iife... and had enough of everything, then you really feel happy. Don't worry sincel am not there to attend to your needs. We can do anything single handedly. You have to have a will for it. Don't trouble your friends for silly things. However close the relation with them may be.. Don't you think about me. But don't get weak... You can change all those .. No one has woken up? Go paletta.. No one is here? Uncle. No one has woken up? I thought you haven't woken up. Do you have a Iot of Iuggage? If you want I can call another boat too. Only two bags. Then, get ready..come fast. Isn't the train at 10? Don't cry grandpa.. Take your medicines regularly. Look after my mother well. Esm Get blessings and get ready to go. Go with a smile.. Dear.. You have to become a big officer afteryour studies. Don't cry. It is Iike she has come home on holidays and going back to hostel. This time the hostel is very far off.. Why? You are in balcony since Iong. It must be more than an hour since the flight took off from Chennai. She called me before she boarded. Sir.We have to cross the ocean to reach Canada, Is it? Yes. Sir..I have shown her, plane flying, so many times, holding her in my hands When she was a child.. Now she is flying alone...

So that I won't get upset. How could she tell me that she is discontinuing studies and eloping? Won't I be sad? Won't her grandpa be sad? What ifl beat her up? May be that is why she didn't tell me. How did you knowthis? Vinitha's friend who works inthe travels told her. Too bad!! This is the problem with the newgeneration. Move to one's own comfon zone. They don't bother if anyone is hun on that. This generation is not bothered about the sacrifices and pain... ...that their dear ones have gone through for them. Don't blame her Iike that Sir. I have dreamt of Charu's future. But those were minor things. A permanentjob, a sorrowless family, that was it Bun she is an educated and intelligent girl. May be she has Iarger dreams. If what Vinitha and sir said is right, ...my daughter will be in a great position after two years. She will live happily with the person she Ioves I hope he is a nice guy. How can you be Iike this...? You sold your house, lost yourjob, became a debtor.. Still, how can you stay Iike this without getting exhausted? I can't afford to get exhausted.Actually, I should work more now. Have to Iook after my father, have to pay back Ioans step by step, By the time Charu comes back I have to make a house .. A decent house...where she can stay I have to do a Iot more work in Iife... I don't have time to get depressed or be sad. Let me go.
