[music playing] - Adam? - No, I just got a lot on my mind. That's all. - You don't have to worry about the wedding. Mother and I have thewhole thing under control. - Carol, would it beterrible of me to ask if we-- if we put the wedding off for a while? Not because I don't love you. Listen, I don't want to lose you, but I don't want to lose myself either. - What happened? - It's a shock being out of the army. I don't know how I'm going to do in this job. I don't even know if I'm goingto like working in a bank. All I know is I want to be as sure of myself as possible in as many ways as possible. Listen, I don't want todisappoint either one of us. You want a cigarette? - No. - Adam? Oh, no! [scream] [music playing] - Carol! - Telephone call for Dr.Bernard, Dr. Peter Bernard. - What's your emergency room, Ms. Freh? - Room 107. - OK. - She's a nurse in this hospital. Her name's Carol Enders. - Well, we'll have herblood type on record then. You can way down the hall. - I should call her mother. - Well, there's a payphone onthe other side of the nurse's station. Prepare her for X-ray. - Telephone call for Dr.Bernard, Dr. Peter Bernard. I'm sorry, Mrs. Bernard, buthe doesn't seem to answer. - You weren't going toget me a telephone, Diana. You were going to get me a drink. - David, please. I don't want Jason to overhear this. It'll only upset him. - Well, then help me out, huh? You've got the money. And why is your precious stepson's sleep so damn more important thanyour ex-husband's rotten life? - You just see it as rotten. - No, baby, you do. - I can give you $100. - Oh, Diana, I am going to go to Canada. I am going to get a job, any job. - I heard those new beginningsstories for three years, David. - Oh, baby. $100 is nothing. You got thousands. Pay me off. Come on. Get me outta here. Come on. - You would've spent every cent I inherited if I hadn't drawn the line. - How much did you hide away, huh? $20,000, $30? - I don't know. It's invested. I don't pay any attention. I don't owe you anything, David. I really don't. David! - No! You don't owe me anything. You ruined my life! - David, stop it! - And you say you don't owe me anything! - Get out of my father'shouse or I'll call the police. - I hate you. Even when I'm sober, remember, I hate you. - Oh, Jason, I'm so sorrythat happened around you. - When are you going to San Francisco? - Sometime in the morning. - Goodbye. [ringing] - Peter? - Yes, dear? - It was David again. I'm sorry to bother you buthe really scared me this time. - Well, did he ask you for money? - Of course. - I think it ought to be reported to the police, especially considering Jason. - Well, maybe because of Jason I ought to give him what he wants. I was thinking maybe I shouldsell some of my stocks. - Diana, you just let that moneysit for your old age, not his. - Are you going to be at the hospital all night? - Well, I'm not sure. I had to bring in one of my outpatients. But now, look, if you're worried about David, why don't you start for San Francisco tonight, stay over in Santa Barbara, and then finish the trip tomorrow. - But what about Jason? - Oh, good Lord. Jason and I have bach'd for years. He won't mind if you're not there. - No, I guess he won't. Goodbye, darling. - Jason, what are you doing here? - Just checking somethingon my motorcycle. Good night. - Jason. - I hate you. Even when I'm sober, remember, I hate you. - I don't owe you anything, David. [car sounds] [crash] [ambulance sounds] - I'm sorry, Peter. She was practically DOA. There was nothing we could've done. - Oh my God. - What is it, doctor? - For a moment there, I thought we'd lost her, but then her pulse,respiration, blood pressure seemed to have stabilized. The ailments of the human bodyalways fascinate us but the way it solves its own problems... That's the real mystery, isn't it? I have every reason to believeshe'll be much better tomorrow. - Carol, can hear me? I called your mother and she said she'd be down here after dinner. She's going to bring some of your things. - Please. - What? - Bring me a rose. - Watch the thorns. - You can smell them, right? Tell me. - They smell beautiful. - Here. - The doctors say that-- - Oh, no. What hap-- oh, Peter! - Carol? - Peter! - Carol, it's Adam. - Why wheres my husband? - Carol. - What are they doing in the garage? - Well, he didn't say exactly. Some kind of a routine investigation. - Well, that lieutenant askedme about her ex-husband. - Oh? What'd you tell them? - I told them they had a bigfight the night it happened. Dad, is it horrible of menot to mind that she's dead? - Jason, my only regret is that the two of you didn't strike it off better. - I just think you and I lived together too long after mom died. We really didn't need anybody else. - I wish I had understood thata little better last year. - Oh, you didn't marryDiana just for me, did you? - Oh no. Diana was a very loving person, self-reliant. I appreciated those things. [doorbell] - Yes. - Dr. Bernard, please. - Come on in. - Dad, someone to see you. - Dr. Bernard, my name's Adam Reston. - Yes? - I've been trying to callyou from the hospital. - Mr. Reston, I just lost my wife and I'm not taking on anynew patients at the moment. My service should've made that clear. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry to barge in butI need to know something. Did you or your wife personallyknow a nurse at the hospital by the name of Carol Enders? - No, not to my knowledge. - Doctor, my fiance's in the hospital right now. - Well, what's that got to do with me? - She's got a concussion, doctor, and she's been calling out for you. - So? - She thinks that you're her husband. - I never saw that girl before in my life. Now, here's a picture of my wife. There is absolutely no resemblance. Has she had her bandages off yet, seen herself in the mirror? - No. - That doesn't explain whyshe keeps calling out for you. You're not her husband butshe insists that you are. - It's all rather hard to believe, Mr. Reston, more than a little painful. My wife died not more than 50feet from here two nights ago. - Peter, is that you? - You recognize my voice. - Oh, yes. Oh, darling, thank God you're here. How is Jason? - He's-- he's fine. - Good. - He sends you his love. - Really? Does he really, Peter? - Yes. Yes, and don't you think youought to take it easy now? I want to get those bandages offyour eyes just soon as we can. Honey, there's some man here, a Mr. Reston. He keeps driving me crazy. He keeps calling me Carol. - Don't worry. I'll talk to him for you. - Thank you. Peter, I will be able to see again, won't I? - I'm counting on it. I promise you. - I don't know. She sounds just like Diana. Not exactly the voice, but the rhythms. And obviously she's taken enough time to pry into my personal life, or you have. Now, Mr. Reston, I don't know exactly what you hope to gain by all this,but at the slightest invasion of my privacy I assure you I will go directly to the police. Do you understand that? - Yeah, but nobody isputting on an act, doctor. She's sick in some way, but Dr. Palmer called it a personality disorder. She'll get treatment and get better. - I certainly hope so for both our sakes. - West. Dr. Bernard, 561 West, please. - Dr. Bernard have any explanation? - Oh, yeah. He thinks we're pulling some kind of a con job. But I guess if I was a man inhis position I'd have to agree. Now when is the psychiatristgoing to see here? - Well, if this condition continues, once the bandages areoff and she sees herself, they're going to be fighting over that case. - Carol seemed to know everything about Dr. Bernard and his son. Now, how's a psychiatristgoing to explain that? - I don't know if he can any more than I as a doctor can explain herphysical recovery two nights ago, at least not in medical terms. - What do you mean? - Well, there were two crises inthis hospital on the same floor at the same time. Dr. Bernard's wife diedof massive bodily injuries at the same moment that Miss Enders was succumbing to her brain damage. And yet suddenly, inexplicably, there's practically nothing wrong with Ms. Enders except for that temporary loss of sight. I mean, it's as though Mrs. Bernard's spirit had somehow invaded your younglady's body and kept it alive. - Aw, come on, doctor. What are you suggesting? That Diana Barnard's soulwent into Carol's room and took over her bodyinstead of going straight up? Oh, oh no. - Mr. Reston, when I was inthe Peace Corps in India, there were thousands of sick crammed into this railroad station after a flood. There wasn't a momentwhen someone wasn't dying. And you could feel the air, thick with the spirits. It was like incense. And no one stopped to even question it. For me, after that it was only a decision whether to become a doctor or a priest. Of course, my report will say she's in a post comatose state suffering from personality disorders. I mean, it covers so little,it covers everything. - Well, there's got to beanother explanation for it. There has to be. - May I talk to her? - That might just be the best thing for her. - Security officer, please go to 133 West. - Nurse? - Yes, doctor? - Will the security officer-- - Mr. Reston's going to talk to Ms. Enders. - Carol, excuse me. It's Adam. - Do you have any official duties in this hospital, Mr. Reston? - No, I'm just personallyconcerned about your health. - And that woman who keeps insisting she's my mother, who's she? Why isn't she under treatment? - You don't know either of us? - Oh, stop it! Listen, you had an accident. It's understandable you could have amnesia, not know who you are, but to be so convincingly like you're someone else!- Hi. Yes, Dan Petrie, please. Have you spoken to my husband about this? - No, not completely. - Well, do. I have hundreds of friends,and they all know who I am. Hi, Dan. Diana Barnard. - Who'd you say? - Diana. Diana Bernard. I'm in the hospital. I just breezed through a prettybad car accident but I'm OK. I've been lying here kind ofbrewing about my ex-husband. Dan, I'd like you to sell about$5,000 worth of his stock. - You say you're in the hospital? - Yeah, I totalled the car, but I'm fine. - Well, is there a doctorthat I can talk to? - Well, not right here. Is there anyone? - Here. Does your Carol have a broker named Dan Petrie? - Mr. Petrie, I'm a friend of this lady's. Look, I don't care who you are, but if you're thinking about ripping off this account, you had better check the papers. Diana Barnard died two days ago. - But you do know her, andshe did have an account there? - Sure, I was her broker for years. But as far as any other information goes, I don't know what you want itfor but you're not getting it from me. In fact, you're going toget it right from the police if this is repeated. - Hey, what are you doing?Give me the phone. - He hung up. What do you mean he hung up? Hey, you listen to me, will you? He hung up because he can'tunderstand what's going on in here anymore than I can. Diana Bernard died two daysago, not more than an hour after her accident. - What's going on around here? Who are you? What are you trying to do to me? - Put these back on. - No! - You should put-- - My hands. My hair, what happened to my hair? Oh, they did surgery. I'm scarred! That's it, isn't it? No, you're beautiful. You're not scarred. - Oh my God, I'm crazy! Oh! - You're not crazy. You're alive. - What about my hands and my face... Oh... - Listen. Listen. Two days ago, Diana Bernard was dying. Her body was destroyed but nother mind, her will to live, her spirit, her soul,whatever you want to call it. But in here, Carol's body was undamaged, but her brain was dying or some part of it. Somehow Diana's spirit invaded Carol's body. - That's not possible. - Carol, I don't have anyother explanation for it! - But Peter, he accepted me. He sent me Jason's love. - Yeah, yeah, Peter. He didn't want to make a scene. He thinks you are seriously disturbed or-- - But I know everything about us, things that nobody else could... Please, Mr. Reston, look at me. Am I the Carol you know? - I don't know. You look like Carol but you don't act like the Carol I love. - Oh, it must be even harder for Peter. At least I look right to you. - What-- what do the doctorsaround here think about this? - They-- they haven't said much, not yet. They want to run some tests, talk to you, have a psychiatrist study your case. - Well, what do I do? - You don't have to do anything. Everybody wants to helpyou even though they don't understand what's going on. They are your friends. I... I never miss Carol. I loved her more. - Mr. Reston. Mr. Reston, this is Lieutenant Carrea. He is with the police department. He was downstairs getting atranscript of Mrs. Bernard's death certificate when he apparently heard rumors of our friend here. - Evidently, Ms. Endersis a friend of the victim or is pretending to be the victim. - Yes, Mr. Reston. An examination of the wrecked car leads us to believe thatMrs. Bernard's death was not an accident. We think she was murdered. - Wait, what do you mean murdered? But how? - Well, we found a cut brake cable, and there was a pinhole openingpunched in the hydraulic brake line. Since someone downstairs suggests that Ms. Enders was claimingthat she knew everything about Dr. Bernard's wife, Ithought I'd like to speak her. - Look, Ms. Enders is a nurse in this hospital. There's no other connection. - Well, for a detective that'sa pretty big connection. Do you think she knewanything about Mrs. Bernard's ex-husband, David Hastings? - I never heard her mention the name. - Well, I'd like to be sure. You see, Jason Bernard-- that's Dr. Bernard's son-- he testified that David Hastingswas in their home the night the accident occurred. Jason said that Hastings threatened her life. - Excuse me. Lieutenant, can I talk to you for a minute? - Excuse me. - What have you talked to her about? - Well, she knows the truth,and I told her your theory. - How'd she take it? - Not well at first. But I think she trusts me now. We'll work it out. - Well, then why don'tyou break the news to her? - I need your help. Do you know David Hastings? - He's my ex-husband. - Did he ever threaten to kill you? - He's threatened me but never like that. - The police think that he murdered you. He tampered with the brakes to your car. Oh, no. He couldn't. He's violent, but kill me? No. It's-- - Diana Bernard's stepson said that he heard David Hastings threaten to kill you. - Oh no, no, no. That's not so. I can straighten that out. Can I? - Look, you were with me all that night. They're not going to buy anything else. You want to get into it with him now? Doctor. - May I? - Ms. Enders, this is Lieutenant Carrea of the police department. - Just one question, if you don't mind. Do you happen to know anengineer, currently unemployed, named David Hastings? - Not that I can remember. - You have no idea where we could find this man? - Why are you asking me this? - Well, you made a phone call a little while ago through the switchboard. You said you were Mrs. Bernard. - Mrs. Bernard? No, no, there's some mistake. I know her husband works in the hospital but I wouldn't know her-- the woman, if I saw her. Adam tells me that-- that she may have been killed. That's not possible, is it? - Why not? - Well, who would want tokill a woman like that? - David Hastings maybe. - May I see you? - Are you all right? Would you like a sedative or something? - No. Oh, wait. I'd like to get up alittle while later and walk in the corridor. Is that all right? - Sure, I'll tell the nurse at the desk. - I do not understand this. I can't figure-- doctor, whatis she trying to pull on us? That switchboard operator wasn't lying. She said she was Mrs. Bernard. - Well, now, she was hit on the head. She had a bad concussion. You have to make a lot of allowances for that. - When was she admitted? - We came in together about anhour before Mrs. Bernard did. - May I see those admission reports? - Sure. - I want a statement from you, too. [music playing] - Ms. Enders? - Where's Carol? - Don't you know? - She's gone. - She wasn't released? - No, she's run off. - I don't know what was goingon in her mind about playing games, but obviously it wasn't working out so she called it quits. No, doctor, no one's calling it quits. She's stuck with it. She is your wife. - I don't like this game, Mr. Reston. Now, I came up here to straighten it out. - Look, doc, there's not time to go into it now. I have to find Carol. The police must have told you that someone murdered your wife. - Well, they have a theory apparently. - Yeah, well, I've got a theory, too, that Carol's out right now looking for whoever it was that murdered her. It's Diane's mind running that search but it's Carol's body that's in danger and that just scares the hell out of me. [music playing] [knock] - One of Tony's friends. - School isn't out for a half hour yet. [knock] - Who is it? - Carol Enders, Mrs. Wyatt. I'm a friend of Diana Bernard's. - You told Diane about us?- Never. - What do you want? - The police are looking for David. I have to talk to him. - What am I going to do? - Please let me come in. I'll try and explain. - No Mrs. Bernard ever even came here. - No, but she once had David followed. - It wasn't mentioned in the divorce proceedings. - That wasn't really the important thing. - What was? - The bitterness and the resentment. - You know, I was a spaceengineer making $30,000 a year when I married Diana. Then the world got bored with the moon and I got stuck in a field nobody needs. You know, I liked what I did. I mean, there were somereal thrills in those days. - I'm sure there were others in your position. Did they give up? - Give up? You know, that's just how she put it. Oh, I tried a lot of things. I just couldn't hold them together. - Well, I'm sure she tried to help you. - Oh, with money, sure. Yeah, but you showed weakness around Diane and she'd cut you out. - The police have a theorythat she was killed. They think you did it. - Me? No. When I'm drunk I've done some stupid things but I could never kill anyone. You see, I got plans. I don't want to blow them. - I have a son, eight. We're all going to Canada. I think he'll like it up there. - He's a good boy. - I'll try it in a factory for a while and maybe welding on the pipeline. What the heck? Anything else I've tried hasn't worked. What's to lose? - I don't seem to have much money with me, but I'll get some more to you.Please take it. I want to help. - Thank you. But I really don't understand why. - Well, I knew Dianaprobably better than anyone. She was hard on you, David. A lot harder than you deserved. Susan won't let you feel like afailure, and that's important, isn't it? - Thank you. - That's spotted about 10 minutes ago. - You check it out? - Not yet. - This slot belongs tothat apartment number 302. - David, there's a police car out there. - Don't run, David, please. I know you didn't kill Diana.I can help you. - How can you help? I never saw you before. - Well, I can. I promise you I will. - Police! - Oh, David. [knock] - Police! Police. David Hastings? Yes? You're under arrest. I have to tell you anythingyou say may be used-- Ms. Enders, what are you doing here? - That's impossible, Lieutenant! She was in the hospital thenight Mrs. Bernard was killed. - She was a nurse in the hospital. Maybe she was having an affair with Dr. Bernard. She has to fit into this someplace. - Well, she doesn't. Not in any way that'd make any sense to you. - Try me. - Lieutenant, have youever heard of possession, when one mind takes overthe body of someone else? - Around here possession means holding. Pot, hard drugs, maybe just a needle, and there's nothing psychological about it. - Well, there's nothing psychological about this either. It's spiritual, beyond explanation. Diana Bernard's mind is livingon in the body of Carol Enders. - Look, I book them onfingerprints and mug shots. That woman is Carol Enders. That woman knew where David Hastings was hiding out. Now, we've got hard evidence that Hastings tampered with the brakelining of Diana Bernard's car. That makes her a suspect as an accomplice. - So you're going tobook her as an accomplice in the murder of Diana Bernard? - Suspicion of conspiracy, protecting a fugitive. - But she is Diana Bernard. You can't arrest her for murdering herself. - Well, Ms. Enders. Thank you. - You claim David Hastings was innocent. Now, why would you say a thing like that? - Because he has enoughtrouble planning his own life. He couldn't possibly lay out a scheme to kill me. - I know him. I was married to him three years ago. - Ms. Enders, three years agoyou were in nursing school and living at home. - David Hastings was at the Bernard home the night she died. The boy says that Hastingsthreatened his stepmother's life. His exact words were, "I'll kill you." - He never said that. - Ms. Enders, you were unconscious when that took place. - Isn't there anything I can do to prove this? - Do you have a copy of the accident report? - Yeah. - Who knows the details of that report? - Myself, the two officerswho reconstructed it, and my supervisor. - That's all? - Well, details of a report like this very often become material evidence. We keep it confidential. - What about the victim? Who would know the detailsbetter than Diana Bernard? - I know I'm making yourelive an possible memory, but you've got to tell us exactly what happened in that car. Diana, just how did you die? - Well, I was tired that night. I was worried that I'd beentoo selfish with David. I was about 10 or 12 miles up the coast road, I guess, going too fast. I tend to speed. I'm sorry. - How fast? - 65, 70. - And then you just lost control? - I was going around a right hand curve. There was another car coming,and it blinded me for a second. And then when I hit thebrakes, nothing happened. - Did you hit anything? - Well, the car swerved off the road, and I was going down an embankment. I remember trying to fight forcontrol of the car, and then-- and there was a pole. No, no, it was too big for a pole. Oh my God, I hit the trees. - I put this in my report, the department's going to have me back inEast LA checking licenses. - Then you do believe her? - All I know is you got a witness there anybody would be out of theirmind to put on the stand. You want to drive 12 jurors crazy? - Look, Hastinga said he'd kill you. He went to the garage. He found some tools. He cut the emergency brake cable. He made a pinhole cut in the hydraulic line. Did you tell him you weregoing up to San Francisco? - No, but he couldn'thave gotten in the garage. I had to unlock it from the inside. - Now, how could you know that? You were in the hospital. - Then don't ask her if she told him she was going to San Francisco. - "You cannot bang the silentzero in search of sound." That's a Chinese poem, andI'm going to take its advice. You stay here. I'll arrange your release. - This isn't a very easysituation for either of us. - I'm sorry I'm not who you want me to be. - If you know yourex-husband didn't kill you, then somebody else out there did. And if you do anything that'sthreatening to him in any way, they'll fight back. - I think I know who killed me. - Who? - Other people's feelings aregoing to be deeply involved. It doesn't frighten me. It just makes me terribly sad. I've got a very painful responsibility, and I've got to handle it myself. - Do the police know that youleft the hospital without being released? - I guess not. Are you going to tell them? - Adam, please, this issomething I have to do alone. - Ms. Enders, you're free to go. - Carol. - I'm not Carol. - Well, aren't you going with her? - I don't know what to do. I want to protect her but I don't have any right to stop her. She's absolutely sane. - Yeah, this is Lieutenant Carrea. Yeah, that's my case all right. OK. You know a man by the name of Dan Petrie? - Yeah, that's the guy shecalled from the hospital. - Well, he's on his way down to talk to me. [crickets chirping] - Here. You feel that on your shoulders? - No, it's all in my hips.It's-- it's perfect. - Yeah, well, you see, that'sthe way it's supposed to be. This the best one. I bought the same kind myself. - Hey, we got a matched set? - Yeah. - We can be a team! How about the bed? - Well, you said to get mummy bags. - Yes, but it's got to be down filling. - Well, wait, wait. There's all kinds of down. You see, there's a peckingorder in sleeping bags, too. Now, there's, uh, there's duck down. - Yeah? - Yeah, that's good. But you just feel that way this fluffs up. This isn't even white goose down. This is gray goose down. It is primo, number one stuff. This is good at even 30 below. - Fantastic. - What were you doing, Jason? - Jason, have you seen ourwire cutters out in the shop? - Uh, not-- not for a while.Why? - Well, I just wanted to makean adjustment on this pack, but pliers would do just as well. - You want me to get them?- OK. - Who's there? Who are you? What are you doing here? - Don't get excited, Jason. I'm not going to cause any trouble. - I don't know you. What are you after? - Whatever you-- whateveryou dropped down that drain. - Everybody drops things down that drain. - The night your stepmother died. A nail? - You couldn't know. - I do, Jason. As much as I regret it, Ihave to tell your father! - Jason! Jason! - I was just going to call you. She was poking around. - What are you doing here? - I have to talk to you. Alone. - All right, Jason. Everything's fine. Just fine, OK? - All right, Miss Enders, I suppose you know breaking into a house is a crime. I just don't understand you. When I first talked to you in the hospital, I thought, well, either she's crazy or she wants something from me. Now, what is it, please? - Peter, Jason's in trouble. He's done a terrible thing. Now-- now, I don't thinkyou realize what he's done-- - Now, look, you don'tknow anything about Jason. Now you're fishing for something. What is it? - Do you remember Cynthia Woods? - Cyn-- What about her? - She broke her hip skiing three years ago, and you operated on her. I was just a-- a friend that came to visit. You asked me to have coffeewith you in the cafeteria, and we got to talking about skiing. - Good God. - We went away to Aspenfor a month and when we got back we got married. Now, Jason felt very left out. I don't-- I don't think he'sever forgiven me for that. - It is you, isn't it, Diana? How is this possible? - I don't know. I know it's not my body butsomehow I've inherited it. Outside in the garage, for the first time, I felt the other person coming back, and-- and I fought her off. I fought to stay in this body. - What were you doing in the garage? - Peter, I saw Jason out there the night I left, the night I was killed. He was looking for something-- something that had fallen down a drain. - What? - Well, I found it tonight. It's some kind of very sharp nail. The police say they're lookingfor something like that. They think that David used it to somehow punch a hole in my brakes. - David? - Yeah, they picked him up today. They-- they found some wire cutters in his car. Now, I don't know how to tell you this, Peter. Jason must have looked up his address and planted the wire cutters on him. - [INCREDULOUSLY]: Jason? - Well, he has a motorcycle. He knows about mechanical things. Now, I don't think he planned toput the blame on David until he heard us arguing that night. - I can't believe that. I just-- - Well, maybe it was just childish vengeance. Maybe-- maybe he didn'teven think I'd die, just-- just be away for a while in the hospital so he could have you all to himself again. - No, no, no, no, no way. Not that boy. He might have been jealous ofyou but he would never kill. You were my wife and I loved you. He would never hurt anyonethat he thought that I loved. - Did you love me, Peter? - Of course I did. - I-- I wasn't just a mother for Jason? A woman who said how hardshe'd try to make him feel like her own son, who was willing to learn how to do all the things thatyou and Jason did together? - I appreciated all those things, of course. - I don't think Jason thought he was killing someone he thought you loved. - That's a horrible accusationto make against my own son. I can't accept it. - Peter, you've got to face up it. Now, David didn't kill me, and the only thing that's going to get him offfor sure is Jason's confession. Now-- now the boy's young. He's-- he's emotionally unstable. They'll take all of that into consideration. - How can I put my own son in jail? - How can you let aninnocent man take the blame? I-- I know it's a horrible position to be in. I'm so sorry about the whole thing. - They can't prove anything against Jason. - Peter, he lied to the police when he said David threatened to kill me. Now, he never said that. And it seems he toldthem the garage was open, and that David could have gotten in any time. Well, that's not true either! - Well, who's going to testify for all that? You? - No. You're going to talk to Jason. He won't lie to you, and thenyou'll both come forward. I know you will. - I don't think I can. - Well, someone has to and it'shateful for me to be the one! But I'll go to them with this if I have to-- if you make me. - It's just a nail. How can it be that important? - I can't swap David for Jason.It's so wrong. - Possibly you're right. - This isn't just an ordinary nail, though. I've seen it someplace before. It's some kind of pin to-- it's a pin to hold fractures together! A... David, Jason must have gottenit out of your bag, and... [scream] - After I spoke to this womanwho claimed to be Mrs. Bernard, I got thinking about it. It's strange, see, becausethere are no more funds in Mrs. Bernard's account.- What? - Well, something happeneda couple of weeks ago. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now, I don't know. Here, Lieutenant. Read this. - "Dear Dan, this letter will authorize the transfer of any fundsto my husband's account at his discretion." Is that her signature? - Yes, I know the signature. I even checked it again before I called you, but that letter is a copy madefrom a duplicating machine. I-- I just accepted it. - Well, according to the notation, the original was sent to her attorney. That seems reasonable. - It seemed so to me, too, until tonight. I called the attorney just to check. He never received the original. I know, it could have been lost, but I thought you ought to know. - Wait a minute, let me see this. I used to work with copy machines in the army, and now at the bank. You can do a paste up with these machines. That's where you move the signature from one document to another. - What happened to the funds in her account? - Uh, she had about $100,000 that she inherited from her father. She went through almost half of that while she was married toa man named, uh, Hastings. - Yeah, we know about him. - Right after she married the doctor, she told me not to lether touch the rest of it. That is, until I got that. - Then what happened? - Well, our brokerage firm alsohandles the doctor's account, but I'm not his broker. I would never have let himget into that commodity again. Especially cocoa! It's like a crap game. You make a fortune, drop a fortune. Nobody can figure it. You want to invest in cocoa, buy a candy bar. Anyway, that's what I'd tell my clients. But the doctor gets this very hot tip from one of his patients. Blows 100 grand. Then I get this letter,and first thing you know, that's the end of her money, too. - Can we go out to his houseand confront him with this? Carol's out there. I'm sure of it. I'm worried about her. - At this time of night? On what grounds? Now, I can't prove that this is a forgery, and there is no crime aboutnot having the original. - Let me see. - Look, I'll buy you twotickets to the Super Bowl if you can prove that that's a paste up copy. - OK.You've been out to his house. Does he have a copy machine there? - No. - How about his office? - Yeah. - Well, maybe I can prove it but I've got to see the machine first. - Thank you, Mr. Petrie. Come along. - Well, there's the copier. - Well, you never got the original. You can be sure it was destroyed. - Hey, here's some checks ofhers with her signature on it. Well, if he did it, he was smart enough not to use this typewriter. - Here we go. - Signature's crooked. - Well, it takes more than a couple of tries, you know, to get it perfect here. - Or it could have been a real copy of a real letter, probably doneon their typewriter at home. She could have had it copied anywhere. What makes you think you'regoing to prove that he put it all together on this copier? No way! - Look, see this here? This machine uses a sort of paper negative. There should be an impressionleft on it of everything that's gone through this machine for weeks. - I don't see anything there. I never heard of this gimmick. - I know these machines. We use them in the Army for classified material. Now, there's a special attachment that re-exposes the negativeso nobody can check it out. All you got to do is get your photo lab people to find the right developer. I hope we come up with something. - OK, bring it along. - She broke into the house, acted crazy. I did what any doctor would be expected to do. - Dad? - Uh, I'll be with you,Jason, in the living room. - Everything all right? - Everything's fine! Jason. - What about that woman? - I had to give her a sedative. She's very sick, mentally. - Why was she in the garage? - Why were you in the garage, Jason, the night that Diana was killed? - Well, I wasn't! Who says I was? - Look, I'm not attacking you, son. I just want the truth. Did you see me? Did you? - Yes. Last week, they sent me home from school for helping out on something. I saw you in the garage. I don't know why I didn't say anything. It was your expression or something. - And the cutters? - You can't leave them around! You cut something and it makes grooves and-- and they can match those with the cutter! - So you-- you got rid of them? - Well, we're a team! We've got the same backpacks! - Oh God. It's bad enough what I did,but for you to have seen it-- - But you wouldn't have doneit without a real good reason. Was she cheating on you, Dad? - Jason, you know whathappens if all this comes out? - It won't. I figured it all out. I looked up her ex old man's address and I put the cutters in his car. No fingerprints! - Do you realize what we're talking about! Jason. Jason, what would happen if-- if we weren't living here? What would happen if we-- we lost this place? You know, I had paid $130 for these. They're the best, Jason. I always-- I always knew the best. Some people have to buythem cheap, pay $30, $40. We've always traveled first class. Tell me, Jason. Tell me that that'simportant to you, please. - I figure we can work anything out. - Jason, you know that woman,if she goes to the police, all the stitches are out. I could give her a stronger sedative. - Wouldn't anybody know? - You and me. - Who is she? - Jason, I want you to get on your motorcycle. I want you to go over to my mother's house and spend the night becausewhat I have to do here does not concern you. Please forgive me, son. Please. - Sure, Dad. I'm afraid, that's all. - That's more than I was ever able to admit. - OK, OK, fine. - Well? - They got something. They're on their way down. - It took them long enough. - OK, OK, we're doing our best. - There you go, Lieutenant. I, uh, hope this is what you needed. - Yeah, me, too. - There it is. Three copies of the letter. - Yeah, it looks like he didn'tget it right until this one. I owe you two tickets to the Super Bowl. Let's get out to the house. That's what the siren's for. - Peter? - Yes? - I just had a strange dream. We were on skis and you were... You were huge, just... - Well, that's just fine. You just go to sleep. Everything's fine. Just fine. [police siren] - Carol? - Lieutenant! - Carol? Carol? - He's dead. - Carol, wake up. - Adam! - Come on. - Come on. - Come on. We'll get you to the hospital. - Where are we? - It's a long story. I'll tell you about it on our honeymoon. [music playing]
