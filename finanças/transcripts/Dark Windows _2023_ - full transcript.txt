911, what's your emergency? Help! There's someone trying to kill me. He's breaking down the door. Miss, I've alerted the Summerset sheriff's office. Help is on the way. Do you have anywhere you can hide? Oh, my God. I think he's inside. Okay. I need you to find a place to hide. Do you have something... Hello? Hello? No. I said no. Tilly... Honey. I don't want to do this. You'll regret it if you don't. I just-- I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. No one expects you to, just... Be polite. Don't smile too much. Oh, God, Mom! Look, your friends are already there. It wasn't my fault. I know. So do Scott and Heather. -Do they? -They'll appreciate you coming. Okay. Yeah. Hello, Mr. Carlson. Hi, Scott. We're so sorry for your loss. Tilly, Louise. Please come in. Come on. Heather, we're so sorry for your loss. Thank you, Louise. I miss her. So much. I don't know about this... Stop the car. Stop it! - I am so sorry. - It's okay. -Here. -It's okay! Just go join your friends. Andrew. How are you doing? I can't talk now. Don't mind him, he just lost his girlfriend. I'm so sorry for your loss, Uncle Bob. I'm not an uncle anymore. Right. So, do you have any plans for the summer? Um, no. Another road trip, perhaps? Improve those driving skills of yours? That's something you could do. Learn how to operate a vehicle like a normal, responsible person. I'm so sorry. Sorry, ah. Now, that must be your favorite word. Did you say that to Ali when her life was fading away? "Sorry... I lost control of the car, Ali. Sorry I dove into the tree, Ali. Sorry I didn't make you wear a seatbelt, Ali!" Why are you here, Tilly? Don't you think you've caused enough pain already? Hi, Bob. Is there a problem? You know what, I'm sure Heather and Scott could use some help cleaning up. Or was there something else you wanted to say to us? Tilly shouldn't be here. We were all in that car together. Me, Tilly, Peter, and Ali. It should have been you. Go fuck yourself, Bob! I'm sorry. Yeah. This is so fucked up. I know. He shouldn't have said that. -He's not wrong. -Don't say that, Tilly. Don't even think it, okay? We can't just sit here and cry and feel sorry for ourselves all day. We have to do something. Monica, we... I have an idea. Threesome? Peter, shut up. It's not the right time. -You saying there will be a right time? -Just don't. -Come on, it's a joke. -Not today. It was kind of funny. My grandparents' farmhouse. We go for the weekend and... eat and drink and swim in the lake. It'll be a lot of fun. It's something to do, it's something other than this. Yeah! I'm game. - Please? - I don't know. Don't leave me alone with this asshole. It's ridiculous. I can't be alone with him. Till? Yeah, sounds nice. It should have been you. I don't know about this... Stop it! You good? You good? Yeah, fine. Wanna hear a joke? Not really. That's okay. I was gonna make a dead baby joke, but I decided it was best to abort. -Eyes on the road, Peter! -Jesus, Tilly. I'm just trying to lighten the mood. Not everything's a fucking joke. Yeah, I know that. You can't fix this. Yeah, well, at least I'm trying. You guys wanna put on some tunes? Yeah, sure, whatever.

I thought we were going to a cabin. Come on! This is insane. Whoa. Guys, you can just drop your shit. How long since anybody lived here? Um, my dad comes up here to write sometimes. But nobody's lived here since my grandparents died. - Well... - Let me show you the house. This is the living room. This is a really good closet for hide and seek... If we decide to play. - No, we're not gonna look at that. -Monica! -Actually I hate that picture. My dad looks so evil. - Hey! - Aww. Hey, look just the same. I don't feel the same. This is... This is my favorite room. I used to just eat Jell-O here, pretend I was a queen. - Ready? - Ready. Oh... Aw, man. - I don't think there's any electricity. Hang on. Try it again. Yeah, we're good. Found the fuse box. I'm surprised anything in this house works. Everything's so... old. And we have internet. Yeah. I'm gonna check out the rest of the house. We've got to get her to snap out of it. I'm so sick of this. Sure. Holy shit! This place even comes with its own creepy basement. Whoa. I don't like it in there. It really freaks me out. - You know what we need? - What? -A drink. -Maybe... Hey, can I use the drawers in here? Yeah, of course. Thanks. Ha, she always does that when she's messaging a boy. It's not like that, okay? Anyone we know? It's just Andrew. Wait, like Ali's Andrew? He's our friend, and he's hurting. And I think he should be here. What? -You can't be serious. -Well, I am. - What are you doing? - Inviting him. Don't, he hates me! No, he doesn't. Besides, the more the merrier. Maybe now isn't the best time to ask, but if Andrew does come... Foursome? It's not a big deal, Tilly. You know that's not true. Well... Oh, too late. Just did it. What the fuck, Monica? God, relax. He might not even show up anyway. Did we bring any beer? I can't see any. Fuck! We forgot. That's totally gonna ruin the weekend. - Like it was going so great already. I'm not trying to be an asshole, I just think that it's time to move on. Well, you're kind of being one. Hey. -She can be a bit... -She just doesn't get it. So did you happen to bring any beer? No. Vodka maybe? Didn't you bring any? I only have what's in my flask. I'm gonna make a run to the liquor store. Want anything? You think that's smart? It should have been you. Stop it! My internet's out. Do you have any service? -Nope. No bars. -Oh, goddamn it. Does it really matter? Yes. Why? Are you gonna text Andrew some more? Tilly, can you let it go? It's like... you are really overreacting. He hates me. His girlfriend just died and he blames me. And somehow you think it's a good idea to ask him to come hang out? What the hell is your malfunction, Monica? Jesus. Just leave me alone, okay? Is that cool? Ali's dead! Don't you care? Tilly. You're so goddamn selfish, Monica. -Tilly. -You don't care, do you? Yeah, of course I do. But I have cried enough and I'm done doing that now. You're not grieving properly. Let me grieve in my own way. After what we did, after everything that happened, we can't just-- Yes, we can! Look... Ali is dead. I know that. I will never forget what happened. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life feeling like shit about it. It's not right. Maybe. But it's not gonna change what happened. - Sixty-five dollars. - Yeah. You old enough? I mean, I haven't got my ID but, um... Nice doing business with you. Yeah. You too. Thank you, Monica. Where did, uh, Peter go? Um... to the liquor store. That's so good. I need to get drunk. I thought we agreed that was a bad idea. Staying sober is a worse one. How long is this pasta supposed to cook for? Um, my dad throws it against the wall, and if it sticks, it's done. Bullshit No, it's true. It's like a thing. There we go. Shit. It's hot. That's so good. -It works, doesn't it? -I love you. I'm happy we're here. I really am. I am. -Hey. -Hey. Hello. Oh... Oh, oh... - You didn't smoke that while driving, did you? - -Nope. We got booze. No way, it's so bad. The worst. It's not bad, it was ahead of its time. "There can be only one." Highlander is a good movie. - I still haven't seen it. - Don't. It's like genuinely awful. And it's so old. Well, I like it. I like it a lot. How did you even see that movie? Ali showed it to me. - Ali had terrible taste in movies. - -Terrible. - Awful, just awful. - It's true. Yeah. - What the fuck was that? - Yeah, what the fuck? Guys, it was just foxes. -Foxes? -Yes. - How the fuck do you know that? -I know shit and... They mate in the dead of night when nobody's around, because they get shy. - You talk such shit. - Oh, come on, you do. I swear to God. Yeah, she was a bit... It's true. When we washed dishes, she washed them, like, three times. And she kept reprimanding you. She kept being like... "Monica." I know. - Hi, guys. - Yo. I don't know about this. Relax, don't be such a loser, Ali. Stop the car. I didn't know you were such a pussy, Ali. You said you hadn't had anything to drink, you should drive. -Aww. Poor little Ali. -Shut up, it's not funny. No, it's not. - But this is. - Don't. Stop! Jesus, stop fucking with my seatbelt. It's not funny. Stop the car. - What? - Now! Tilly, make him stop. I'm so sorry, Ali. I don't know about this. Hello? Peter. Hey. I didn't mean to... -No, I know. -I didn't mean to... - I didn't mean to. - Let's get you to bed. I got it. Here. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Close your eyes and go to sleep. It's just... I don't know about this. Hey. What's up? Are you okay? Mind if I sleep here? Of course not. I think I heard Ali's voice. What do you mean? She said... "I don't know about this." I know it's crazy. No, it's not. I... There's no judgment here. It's just me. It's weird. Are you sure you really heard it? I don't know. I just don't want to be alone right now. I get it. Oh, gosh. -You okay? -Yeah. I'm just thinking about... If you'd went to sleep in Peter's bed, he would have had a field day. Even if, he wouldn't have been in any shape to do anything about it. I found him drunk off his ass on the kitchen floor. -Oh, God. -I had to help him into bed. At least I know what that noise was earlier. I kept hearing this thing, it was, like, moving all around, but it was still sort of quiet. Must have been Peter tip-toeing off to his own private afterparty. He is sneaky, that boy. But he's not sneaky enough. Peter's an alcoholic, isn't he? No, he's too young to be an alcoholic. I don't think it works that way. His dad died from it. I know. We can't ignore it anymore, not after the accident. Not after everything that happened with Ali. We should get some sleep. Do you mind turning off the light? I love you, Tilly. Love you too. Hey. I didn't mean to startle you. That's fine. You sleep okay? Not really. You? No. Thanks for the bucket. I hit it... most of the time. Good. Tilly, uh, last night... Did I...? It's okay. Don't worry about it. No, it's not okay. If I ever do that again, just... punch me in the face. What? Just go for it, don't hold back. All right, deal. -Peter... -Uh-huh? You maybe, uh... wanna cut back some? Do you hear me? I got it under control. I don't think you do. I said it's fine. It didn't seem fine yesterday. Look, just leave it. Don't go doing me any favors, okay? Seems to me I already did you a pretty huge fucking favor. Hey! Peter! I don't know about this. You said you hadn't had anything to drink. You should drive. God, stop the car. Stop it! It should have been you. Tilly, make him stop. Jesus, stop fucking with my seatbelt, it's not funny. Assholes. Peter! Eyes on the road. Peter! Shit! - What's up? - What's up? Do you guys wanna go for a walk? Walk where? Uh, just around, 'cause... I wanna get service. Sure, I'll come. Can you please come? We haven't even talked all day. No. I'll get the last few hours of sunlight. Okay, suit yourself. Ready, soldier? Let's go. Bye, I love you. Bye. Wish us luck. Good luck. Holy shit. Do you get anything? Nothing. It's getting cold. Maybe we should turn back. No, not yet. Does it ever warm up around here? What do you mean? Last night, I was freezing my ass off. Well, maybe you shouldn't have opened up all the windows. I didn't. Tilly said all the windows in the house were open. Well, I didn't do it. Are you sure? You were pretty drunk. Whatever Tilly said, she was exaggerating. I was fine. Okay. Peter? How did your dad die? You know that already. No, I don't. Not really. Liver transplant went wrong. So... his system broke down. And how's your mom? What's she doing these days? My soon-to-be stepdad, mostly. She spends all her time with him. Hanging with him and his kids. That's rough. When Mom does come home, she just... looks at me. Looks at you how? Like I'm just like my dad. Like I'm toxic waste. You're nothing like your dad. Snap, I got two bars. Ah, yes. Anything good? Nothing. Uh, my mom says hi. You should see what she said to me. - Do we head back? - Yeah. I don't know about this. Guys, is that you? I don't know about this. Tilly, make him stop. Ah! Tilly, make him stop. Ali? Are you here? What the hell! -Tilly? -There's someone here. - What? - There's someone here. Inside? Inside... I don't know. -We've got to go. -Okay, calm down. What happened? I'm trying to tell you, there's somebody here. Are you sure that you saw somebody? No, but I heard them. We've got to go. What do you think? Fuck if I know. Okay, I'm gonna try calling the police. I still don't have reception. - Okay, let's just leave. - Wait a second. Monica. We have to go, there's somebody here. Let's just check, okay? Come on. Everything looks fine... Look! Ali's shrine. You didn't put it up, did you? No, I thought you did. Well, I didn't do it. -The open windows. Oh, fuck. -What? I think Tilly's right. We've got to get out of here. Do you have the keys to the car? - Let's go! - Come on. Okay, let's... - What the hell? - I got it. -Start it. -I'm trying. - It won't start? - Uh, no! -How far to walk to the village? -You're kidding. To Summerset? It's miles away, it'll take hours. Okay. What exactly did you hear? I was cooking in the kitchen and then I heard this voice. Ali's voice. It wasn't her though. It was... It was somehow digital, a recording, from the crash. How could anyone have heard us that night? How could anybody have recorded us? I'm not sure. Somebody knows. Knows what? Don't be an idiot, Peter. Somebody knows what actually happened. Who? -Andrew. -No. No way. Even if he did know, he wouldn't do anything about it. I don't believe it. Andrew is total goody two shoes. Even when Ali was alive, he wouldn't hang out with me because he knew that I li... that I liked him. So he kept his distance. Please. It's not him, I swear. Fuck! It's just a prank, guys. -It's some local kids... -Local kids... We're in the middle of the fucking wilderness. Peter, calm down. You're not helping anything. Fuck, fuck! Okay! It's a prank, guys. Even if they did know what we did, they wouldn't hurt us. Right? - We don't know that. - Please! Okay. We can't stay here. You just said someone is in the house. I'm not gonna go in there. Maybe they are. But either we run, or we go back inside and close all the windows and doors. What does it matter if we're in the car or in the house? I don't know, all right? I just don't want to die in a fucking car the way Ali did! Let's go. Okay, we stick together no matter what. -Okay. -Yeah. Maybe we're just panicking needlessly, maybe... Is that from the car? Peter, take this. Okay. Okay. Oh, God. We should have ran. Fuck that. We stay together, always. Okay? I can't hear him anymore. He's by the window. Maybe we can make a run for the front door. Fuck! -Is it locked? -Yeah. You have the key? I left it under the rock. We've called the cops. No, you haven't. The motherfucker is toying with us. - What the hell does he want? Let's go, let's go! Come on! I don't know about this. I didn't know you were such a pussy, Ali. - Stop the car. - What is that? Don't worry, he's a good driver. Aww, poor little baby. - It's not funny. - It's not funny? You wanna know what is funny? Jesus, stop fucking with my... I said it's not funny. Tilly, make him stop. Assholes. Peter. Eyes on the road. Peter! Oh, shit! Ali? Ali? Ali? She has no pulse! Oh, fuck! No, no, no, no... Oh, man! Give me the car keys. Give me the car keys now. We deserve it. We deserve it. No. No, we fucking don't. It was a mistake, we didn't mean to do it. It was just a prank. Okay. Listen to me, guys. We're gonna get out of here. We're gonna make it through this. All of us, together. Say you understand. Say you understand! I understand. We don't deserve this. You don't deserve this. Say it. Say it to me. I don't deserve this. Good. We are gonna make it out of here. Just fine. You said that before. After the accident, before the police. I said it 'cause I meant it. Listen. To what? Nothing. There's no sound. What is it? Come on, come on. Come here. Where did he go? I don't know. Looks like we missed our chance. Hit the lights. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! No. Andrew. Andrew. No. - Oh, fuck. - No. Monica! -Pull her out! Pull her out! -Pull! -Let go! -Monica! No! -We gotta go... -What? We have to get her. -What? -He's got her. Jesus, no fucking way. It's too late. It's too fucking late to help her! Oh, no. No, don't do that now. Please don't do that now. We're both dead. And you know it. Fuck it. I have to go. -What? -I'm gonna make a run for it. You can't go out there! Here. Take this. If he comes near you, just hit him in the head. I'll call the cops once I get far enough away from the house. I got a signal out there earlier. No. No, no, no, wait. No! We can take Andrew's car. We can go together. Yeah, like that's gonna work. He removed the fucking battery from my car, Tilly. He's probably fucked up Andrew's car already. Don't leave me. Please don't leave me. No, Peter, no! Peter. Peter! Fuck. There's no signal. There's no fucking signal. No. No! Oh... Tilly... Can I play with Tilly? Can Tilly come and play? Three, two, one, here I come. I'm going to find you... ♪ Ring around the rosies A pocket full of posies ♪ Fuck you! ♪ A tissue, we all fall down ♪ Come on, you asshole. 911, what's your emergency? Help! There's someone trying to kill me. He's breaking down the door. Okay, I just need you to stay calm. -Do you have an address? -Yes. I'm... I'm at a house near... Summerset. It's, um... It's the McLaney's family home. Off, um, off the I-34. Miss, I've alerted the Summerset sheriff's office. Help is on the way. Do you have anywhere you can hide? Oh, my God, I think he's inside. Okay. I need you to find a place to hide. Do you have something... Hello? Hello? No. You deserve this. Fuck you. You don't have to do this. I know it's you, Bob. Scott and Heather wouldn't want this. You're wrong. What the fuck? Peter. Why are you doing this? Because you killed my daughter. Because of what you did to her. She asked you to stop. You didn't. How the fuck do you know that? I know you were driving drunk and that she took the blame. And I know you kept undoing her seat belt until it killed her. And you didn't stand up for her. And you were supposed to protect her! Ali called me. Asked me to pick her up. I didn't answer. But she never hung up the phone. I heard everything you did. And you keep drinking. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Fuck. -Fuck. Fuck. -Please forgive me. I'll do anything, anything. I forgive you. No! No! Oh, my God. Stop it! Stop! - You were having so much fun, weren't you? -I'm sorry. -Please! -Killing her... I'm so sorry! First thing Ali broke was her arms. No! Don't. Please don't. And then... her head hit the windshield... ...and breaking her neck. Tell me... when her life was fading away... did you still think you were funny? It was me! It was me. What was you? Monica undid the belt the first two times. But the third time... the time Ali died... It was me. It was me. I'm glad you told me. No! Please stop... You took the only thing that mattered in my life. What are you gonna do to me? Nothing. What? You're gonna live with it. Don't move. Stop moving.
