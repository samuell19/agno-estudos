- [Pebbles] Hi, I'm Pebbles. What are you doing right now? Something naughty? (giggling) Something fun? Share with us. 1-900-10MIAMI. - Hello, my name's Grace. Are you lonely? Would you like to talk to me? Share your secret desires with me? Just call me, I'm waiting to talk to you. Call 1-900-10MIAMI. - [Pixie] Hi, I'm Pixie. - [Man] I wanna talk to Grace. Grace? It's me again. I can't allow you to go on like this, teasing me. You've been a naughty girl, Grace. And you know what happens to naughty girls? They burn in Hell for eternity. I'm putting an end to this flirting. I'm coming for you, Grace, and I will find you. No man will ever touch you. I am your destiny. Grace, don't hang up! Bitch! (suspenseful music) (upbeat island music) - You yell four. - Number four? - Four. - I know that, what if I hit him? - You yell four, you won't hit him. - It's time for a lawsuit. - (chuckles) What do you care? You've got nothing to give him. (muffled) Big deal. I'm gonna show you a pull. (muffled) As much as you have. How much you hauling? - A nickel. - What? - A nickel a hole, you got it. Warm up. - That's good, that's good. - A nickel a hole? - [Mack] Nickel a hole. - Hike! (laughing) - Get out of here. - A nickel a hole? - Nickel a hole. - I dub thee, Sir Ball. Oh! (laughing) Where'd you like me to stand? - Any place you like. - I'd like to stand close to you. - Well get up there. Come closer. Now move the foot. - There you go. Proud of you. Oh, sorry. - Right here. - Oh. (laughing) (yelling) - Picked a hell of a time to go on a vacation. - Well that's just my point. It is a hell of a time to go on a vacation. We haven't had a case in five weeks. The rent on your dumb boat is due. The Tabbot Sports page is as long as a tapeworm. - All right, all right, so the private detective business is a little slow. Hey man, you know, big things can happen any time. - Yes, I know, but I have a big thing that I'm going to give to a feminine mystery in Jamaica. She is waiting on me at this moment. You got it? - I can understand that. - Good, I'm glad you can. - My man. - I rest my case. (laughing) - So, tell me, how long you gonna be gone, man? - Depends. - Depends on what? - How long my cash holds out. (laughing) - Two days, I expect to see you back in two days. - You're probably right. You know, I've been thinking. I know I could have been a good cop. - Oh, come on now, don't give me that crap. You're just like me, man, unemployable. You stay in the game too goddamn long. You don't like taking orders, you like to give 'em. And the hours you keep? Forget about it. - I know, I know, I know! Making tackles is a lot easier than this unpredictable stupid spy stuff we do. Besides, we take four hours for lunch. - Lunch? - Yeah, lunch, four hours. - Mama, I gotta get ready for my mama. Big shopping day. See you, partner. - Is it her money? - Mine. (slow music) Look, I'm gonna stop here for a couple minutes, and get a few things. Now, you wait for me, okay? - Okay. - all right. - Just take what you want, and please, don't hurt us. (alarm ringing) - Damn. Mama. You all right, mama? Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hold it, hold it! (gunshots) (gunshot) - Hey pal, throw down the gun! Throw down the gun or I'll blow this one away! Throw it down! Your move, pal! (gunshots) (screaming) - You okay? - Yeah, I think so. - Oh, mama. Mama. - Get back! Get back or I'll kill her! - Shoot, Mack, shoot him between the eyes! (screaming) (gunshots) - Hello, this is Roland Friedricks, WXTV Miami. With me now, is Mrs. Mabel Derringer, who was involved in averting a daring daytime robbery attempt here at the Seaside Mall. - [Officer On Radio] 31546. - Every license you're supposed to have is expired. You're walking around with an unlicensed piece, bodies all over the goddamn place. - Come on, Ted, I was just doing my public duty, okay? You can fix it, right? - I can't fix this kind of shit, and I'm tired of covering for you, man. Forget it, I'll fix it. Walk away. Paledo, don't leave. I need two guys back. (muffled) The bitch. - [Officer On Radio] 335 new badge MB information. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. I still gotta go to the hospital, though, my dad was hurt really bad. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you for everything. - Bye bye now. You all come and see me, okay? Bye. Mack? Mack? - Maybe we can talk again sometime, okay? That's my mama callin', I gotta go. - Nice talking to you, too. Good morning, Jennifer. - Hi, Patty, how's it going? - Hey, I've had three proposals already. - Already? So soon? - Some of these guys wake up in the morning at full attention. - That's just because they don't know which head to think with. (giggling) - See ya later, I'm out of here. - See you later, Patty. (beeping) Suzi, any calls for me? - A couple, but they said they would call back. I think one of them was that same weird guy that's been calling for a week or so. - God, I was hoping that when I hung up on him last night he would never call here again. - [Suzi] How wrong you were. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - This is Pebbles at your service. Certainly, just a moment. - Hey, Jennifer, that weird guy's on the phone for you. - God, why would she need my name like that? Hello, this is Grace. - [Man] You're still teasing my Grace. You say things, but you don't mean 'em. I tried to warn you, but you didn't listen. You're forcing me to punish you, Grace. I'm gonna make you mine. - Please. - [Man] You can't run from a shadow in the moonlight, Jennifer. - Damn. Suzi! Suzi. That was dumb, that was really dumb. - What? What did I do? - You used my real name, he heard you. - So what? That freak sounds like he's a million miles away. - Suzi, don't you ever do that to me again. - Okay, okay, I'm sorry. (phone ringing) Hello? - I saw you on T.V., you sure are pretty. - Thanks. What's your name? - [Billy] Billy. How many girls work there with you? - Well, usually four, but... I'm alone right now, it's so late. Did you get a busy signal? - Yeah. - I thought so. We had a lot of calls lately. - [Billy] I want you to tell me how you'd like to do it. - Do what? - [Billy] You know, it. - Maybe you're a cop. - (laughing) Do I sound like a cop? - I guess not. - [Billy] So tell me how you want me to do it to you. - Well, you know, like... Like, well, like an-- - [Billy] Animal. - (giggles) Yeah. - [Billy] Doggy style. - Woof, woof, woof. (laughing) Hello? - [Billy] You're going to get your chance. No more teasin', Pebbles. (glass breaking) (screaming) - No, no! (screaming) No, please, no! No! (screaming) - [Woman] Escort service. - Listen, I'm new in town, and I want a girl who'd do anything I want. I understand you've got a Francesca there. (gasping) (screaming) - [Woman On Radio] I have a complaint about vehicles. 325 Northeast fifth at Willow Wood Apartments. 325 Northeast fifth. With silver Cadillac and a green Cadillac parked so that we cannot see the oncoming traffic. - Jennifer. I gotta ask you something. You see this note? Who is this Billy? - I don't know, it's just a voice over the phone that keeps calling me. He keeps telling me these things that we wants to do to me. - You think this guy was local? - No, he sounded far away. The strange thing about it, is there's this picture missing off my desk. - [Officer] Picture? - Yeah, one of Mack and I during our better times. - Why the hell would you want a picture of the two of you? Jennifer look, this may not be my place to say, but... You're a friend, and... I don't want you working here, it worries me. - Well, I've asked for a security guard many times before, Ted. - Security guard won't make a difference, crazies wanna get ya, they'll get ya. It's just that, this is not the kind of a job for a person like you. - Well, what do you suggest I be, a secretary? Is that for me? I mean, come on. - Look, let me finish up things, why don't I take you home? - That's okay, I got a car. I can drive, Ted. But thanks, I mean, I appreciate your concern. (car starting) (slow reggae music) (women chattering) - [Billy] Francesca? - [Francesca] You must be Billy. - Something for you? - [Francesca] What's with you? - I'm not here to make friends, I need your services. There's a private detective named Derringer, he's got something that belongs to me. I need you to bring it to me, so I can take what's mine. - [Francesca] And, why should I do that? - [Billy] 10 grand. - Hello, Mack. - Jennifer, what brings you here? My support check bounce? - Mack, do we gotta fight every time I see you? - All right, I'm sorry. What brings you here? - One of the girls got killed where I work last night, and I don't, god, I don't know how to feel, I don't know what to do. It's driving me crazy. I keep getting these strange calls. I got a call from one guy who recites poetry to me, and tells me how much he loves me, and then I get this other guy. God. He's just crazy. He just scares me, you know? - Meaning? - Meaning he tells me all these things that he's gonna do to me. He tells me he wants to make me his. - All right, how can I help? - Well, I know that you've got ways of finding things out about people. Ways that are a lot different than the police. - For old time's sake, right? - Please. - All right. I'll walk you to your car. (ominous music) - You should call me sometime. (upbeat jazzy music) - Okay. Fine. Do it tonight? Thanks, guys. Heartache? - Nice tune, Renee. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Gar, can I have a glass of water, please? Thanks. So, who's winning what, and by how many points? - Well, it depends on what kinda sport you like. Round ball, or oblong ball? - I love when you talk dirty. (laughing) - That new tune you were doing, that's for your friends tonight? - Well, it's a secret of life, we keep it new and fresh, and they keep wanting it. - That kinda works for everything, doesn't it? - Man, this is a heavy conversation. (laughing) - Speaking of heavy, man, I saw some dude today who had bad intentions. - Bad intentions? That's your problem. My problem is, if business doesn't get any better, I'm gonna have to come out of retirement. (laughing) Can you imagine me coming out of retirement? I mean, they're small, but they were sticky. They called me Glue Fingers. You remember Chicago? Super Bowl. Two minute warning. - 60,000 people, Soldier's Field, 20 below zero. - Oh no, not again. - Balls on the 30, third down. - So what am I this time? A pitcher or a quarterback? - [Mack] Pretend you're Bart Star. - Who the hell is Bart Star? - Will history repeat itself? Will the Hail Mary prevail to our victory once again? (crowd cheering) (whistle blowing) (slow jazzy music) - Oh my god, what is that? - Trouble with a capital T. - I was thinking more like the F word. - Yeah. - Mack Derringer? - [Mack] You got it, have a seat. - My name is Francesca. - The F word. - I beg your pardon? - Private joke. - I need a bodyguard, Mr. Derringer. - I don't do bodyguard, I'm a private detective. Describe your problem. - A jealous boyfriend who likes to use me for a punching bag. - Well, that could be a problem. - I'm going to a party tomorrow afternoon, and I want protection. I don't like scenes. - Can understand that. - What makes you think your boyfriend is gonna bother you at this party? - He says he wants me to bleed to death in front of all my friends. - Do you have a lot of friends? - Never enough. He's dangerous. I'll pick you up tomorrow at four o'clock. And Mr. Derringer, bring your gun. - Man, now that was all female. - No question about it. Hey, Ted. Hey look, I wanna thank you for taking care of that little matter for me. - One of these days, I might not be able to take care of one of these little matters for you, if you don't get your act together. - Hey, Ted, how's the crime business? - Always a wiseguy, huh, Jake? - Kinda thought you'd be dropping by today. - And I did. I need to talk to ya. In private. - Follow me. Okay, shoot. - It's about Jennifer. - Who else? - This new job she's got. It's phone sex, this is bullshit. - Come on, Ted, it's not phone sex, and what are you telling me for? She's my ex-wife, remember? - It's phone sex to me. Miami's not the right place to play this kinda game. We've had more sex crimes in the last six months than any other city in the country. - If you're so worried about it, why don't you tell her yourself, huh? - Don't shit me, Mack. I know you're still in love with her. - Ted, I know you've had a thing for Jennifer ever since you met her. It's okay, man, it's cool. She's no longer my thing. You want it, go for it. - God damn you, Mack, you're such an asshole, I thought you'd care. Say something to her, do something about it. You don't really give a shit though, do you? - I do give a shit, Ted. I just don't give a shit that you give a shit. - What's happening? - Well, Jennifer's got some weirdo calling her at work. Ted's trying to make it his personal problem. - Personal? - Yeah, he's got a thing for Jennifer, but he's afraid to tell her. - What's the big deal? You like someone, you tell 'em. - Look who's talking, loverboy himself. Why aren't you married? - Never found somebody to tell it to. - Yeah, well I think my man's problem goes a little deeper than that. It has something to do with the fact that I knew Jennifer first. I don't think he can ever get over that. We went to college together, we had classes together, he fixed it that way. My homework was his homework. - Sounds like you had a gorilla on your back. - We graduated together, we tried out for the pros together. I made it, he didn't. I don't think he ever forgave me. - Took it kinda personal, huh? - Yeah, I guess. Hey, but we kinda keep in touch. I send him passes to all the home games. After I met Jennifer, I asked him to bring her to the games. But I always felt my man had some resentment, either for Jennifer, or football. But hey, time keeps moving, right? - Yeah. - Speaking of moving, I got a little thing I gotta go get ready for, you know what I'm saying? (laughing) - You tell the little thing you gotta go get ready for is that hot mama that just left here. I don't think you'll ever quite get ready for that, bro. (laughing) - [Casey] Hello, Mr. Derringer. - You know, I was moving so fast the other day, I didn't get a chance to get your name. - Casey, Casey Woods. - Casey, hello. - Hi. Listen, I just wanna thank you for what you did for us. You know, because of you, they didn't get away with anything. - Well I'm glad I could be of help. Right place, right time. - Well, also, this wasn't just a robbery. - What do you mean by that? - See, they were there to collect protection money from my father. He refused, so they were there taking the merchandise for their payment. - A shakedown, you tell this to the police? - Yes, yes we did, but what can they do? Put a 24 hour guard on our store? I don't think so. Listen, Mr. Derringer, I saw by your card that you're a private investigator. See, we don't have much money, but we'd be glad to pay you what we can if you could please help us. Maybe you could talk to these people, or something. See, we can't afford to stay in business, and pay them too. - Well, it's hard to refuse a beautiful lady in distress. - Thank you, Mr. Derringer. - Call me Mack. - Thank you, Mack. Here's my number, maybe you could give me a call later. - I'll do that. - Okay, thank you Mack. Bye. - Bye. - You smell good, Mr. Derringer. - So do you. (reggae music) - What are you looking at, Mr. Derringer? - Well, didn't your mom ever tell you to wear underpants? (laughing) - Sure, in case of an accident. But then, I don't believe in accidents. Do you, Mr. Derringer? - Guess not. How am I supposed to know this jealous boyfriend? What's he look like? - You'll know him when you see him. - I'm not sure if I like that. - [Man] Easy. Who's casino boat? (guests chattering) - [Man] Yeah, they were playing at the Boulevard Cafe. - Why don't you have a drink? I'm gonna go freshen up. - Well, that sounds marvelous to me, since I'm your bodyguard, that means I get to go everywhere, right? - I think I'll be okay in the ladies room. - All right. What a woman. - You think he's too old for her? - Most definitely. An old geezer like that. - He's my sugar daddy. - Really? - I'm Nancy Billings. - Mack Derringer. - Have you ever been a sugar daddy, Mr. Derringer? - (chuckling) Not that I know of. - Well, maybe another time, Mr. Derringer. Enjoy. - Mose would like to see you downstairs. (gunshots) - [Woman] Jean Claude! - Okay, let's go over this again. You came in the door, you got hit on the head, and then you came to with a gun in your hand, and a dead man on the bed. - Right. - Wrong. You came in here to steal something, and you got caught, and that's what really happened, isn't it? - You need a couple of Tic Tacs, pal. Maybe a few. - Smart ass. We'll see how big your mouth is when we get you downtown. Cuff him. (muffled speaking on radio) - You just can't seem to stay outta trouble, can ya? All right, give it to me, short and sweet. - Look, somebody hit me on the head, knocked me out, fired a shot, stuck a gun in my hand. When I woke up there was a dead body in front of me. - Who would do that? - Come on, Ted, if I knew that, I wouldn't be standing here like this. - What are you doing here? - Some lady hired me to protect her from a boyfriend. - You check this out? - Yes sir, we looked for this lady, there's nobody here like he described. - Let's go downtown, let's talk about this a little more. Do you mind? - What about these, huh? - Regulation, Mack, you oughta know that. (suspenseful music) - [Mack] Thanks for bailing me out, partner. Listen, I heard the cops say that this guy, Jean Claude, that was shot, owns a photo studio in South Beach, he and this Santiago character are partners in a big porno operation. Check this out, he also owned a bunch of 900 number business. So, I say we start at the photo studio. - [Jake] Look, why don't you just kinda let things cool down, you know? - [Mack] Thanks for the advice, but I gots to go. - [Jake] And I've gots to go with you. (dog barking) can you imagine how much energy it would take to make love to all these models? Jesus. Hey, that's Jennifer. - [Mack] In living color. - Hell, and as I live in lust, Francesca, the F word. I liked her better in the car I had. - [Mack] With no underwear. - [Jake] I'll check for some files. - [Mack] Right. - We've got files on Jennifer, no Francesca. - [Mack] Check on Nancy Billings. - Billings, Billings Montana, Ms. Billings. Billings. Billings, ah, bingo, we've got Nancy Billings. - All right. - Yeah. What's that for? - Oh, this is just something to help me sleep. - Bad dog. (dog barking) (grunting) (dog barking) (gunshots) Why don't you shoot? - With what? Left my goddamn gun in the car. - Oh, terrific, some private dec you are. - Hey, hey, what do you want from me, huh? - Oh, shit. (tires screeching) (gunshots) - Hey! Hey! - I thought he was on vacation. - Yeah, so did I. I tell you what, I'll get a ride back to the club with him, see you in 10. - Got it. - I can shoot better than that. - So, what happened to your vacation? Why you back so soon, man? - Say thank you, Lenny. - Thank you, Lenny. - That's better. - So what happened? - Same old story. Every time I think I find a garden, it turns out to be a briar patch. Now, this slut puppy I went to see, I went to see personally, with my heart full of love. - What's a slut puppy? - A slut puppy, you know what a slut puppy was, you taught me the game.

Well, what do you think? - Santiago probably wanted to get rid of this guy before he was able to distribute the pictures of Nancy. - His mistress. Well, that's probably why those thugs were in that place. - Sounds logical. Next stop, Nancy Billings. - Nuh-uh, my day's work is done. I'm gonna go home, and think about it. I'll come up with this broad's address, or phone number, or whatever it is, okay? - That's cool. - Yeah. - Hey look, one thing, man. - Yeah, what? - Thank you. - Nah.

Adios. - Hello. - Hi. - I was hoping you would call. - Well, I have good news for you. - No, not just for business. It was really nice to hear from you again. - Well, it's always nice to call a beautiful lady. But you know those guys that were bothering you? I went and had a little talk with them. I don't think they'll bother you again. - Do you always get results this fast, Mack? - Only when I try really hard. - All right, well, you tell me your fee, and I'll write you a check. - Nah, that won't be necessary. Seeing you again will be payment enough. - It was really nice to hear from you again. - It's my pleasure. - Shit man, you're still alive.

I'm just trying to find out who set me up, that's all. - He's lying, he was asking a lot of questions. - Like I said. (groaning) (laughing) - Look at that, he's got weak knees. - Violence is not my style, I'm a businessman. Oh, I'm sorry about what happened to you on the yacht. I had nothing to do with it, believe me. However, now... You pose a problem. - My problem is, I wanna know who set me up. (laughing) - Look, you're gonna have to excuse Hugo, he's a very impatient man. - Let me kill him now, Mr. Santiago. - Mr. Derringer, you're making Hugo very very nervous. You understand that. And, I have to do... What I have to do. - Come on, Mr. Derringer, let's have some fun. (suspenseful music) Hey Billy Bob, don't make no sudden stops, or I might slip and make a big mess in the car. (laughing) (cars honking) Everybody get away! Come on, get away! (laughing) (yelling) - You scared the hell out of me! - Yeah, I can see it all over the seat. Look here, partner, why you so brilliant that you happen to put this baby in the right place. How you know I was gonna do this, run here, and jump in this car at this particular space? - Because you always ran to the left, everybody on the field knew that, so I just thought I'd park to the left. - Yeah yeah, right, okay, let's have a drink. - Yeah, get in! One man will fight, get in! - How long you been following me? You some kind of psychic or something? Nevermind, nevermind, I don't even wanna know. - Hey, I know you, you're Mack Derringer, right? - You got it. - Well I'll be, the greatest defensive back to play pro football for the 49ers - That's right. - [Man] They called you The Bruiser, right? - The man knows football. - The Bruiser! (laughing) - This is Lenny. - Hello. Lenny, Lenny, number 86. - Number 55. - Right. - Hey Mack, you're my man, how about an autograph. - You got it. - Hey, since I'm here, can I grab yours too, Benny? - Sure, you're unzipped. Benny with a B. - Defensive tackle, right? - Linebacker. - Right, right, well hey, thanks fellas, you guys made my day. Can only be good things after this. - Now can we be serious? I wanna know if you've got this mess figured out yet. - No, I don't have it figured out. - I'm not surprised. What's your next move? - See a pretty lady. (laughing) - That's good. You've got some people trying to kill you, not to mention these two new friends we just met, and you're thinking about getting laid? - Can you think of something better? - No. (laughing) - I can understand that after your failure in Jamaica. - Well we're not in Jamaica now, so let's move across the street and get something to drink. - [Mack] My man. Forget something? - You know, I didn't get a chance to show you what I had for you. - [Mack] Oh really? - Mm-hmm. It's chilly out here, wanna go inside? - You got it. Maybe a drink will warm you up, okay? - [Casey] Sure. - No wonder you were chilly. (slow music) (ringing) - Mack, I've been looking for you everywhere. I left messages at the hospital, I was hoping you were gonna come here. - Well, I haven't had time to check my machine lately. - Look, your mom's on T.V., she's talking about you. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - [Roland] Mrs. Derringer, we all know how you must feel about your son. - Listen, I know my son didn't do anything wrong, that's not the way I raised him. Mack, son, you be careful out there. I know you're kicking butt and taking names, but you be careful. - This is Roland Friedricks, back to you, Larry. - I'm not through yet, I'm not finished yet. And son, I want you to know, your mommy is backing you up all the way. - Back to you, Larry. - [Mama] I, I'm. - Way to go, mama. Can I use your phone? - Yeah, sure, it's in there. - I remember. (upbeat jazzy music) (phone ringing) - Hey Bruiser. - Hey, Jake, hey. Man, you guys sound like you're having a great time there. Look, I need you to make a few calls for me, try to find out something about this Billy character. - Billy? - We know that Francesca works for some kind of escort service. See if they kept the records on their clients. Yeah, this Billy must have hired her to lure me to the party. You got all that? - Got it. Right at you. - You know, George, you're the only guy I've ever heard of that gets capital punishment. Yeah, do you think anybody really misses Ted Bundy? Oh, drop dead. - Hey, partner. - [Attendant] Yeah? - I need some conversation. - What do I look like? A tour guide? - Could be. I've been checking some escort services around here. One of them said a Billy called them from here. - What's that supposed to do? - Help save you from a butt kickin' if you don't start being nice to me. - I'm shaking. Know what this is? It's bulletproof glass, what are you crazy? What do you think, you're Superman? Calm down. - [Jake] Bulletproof from this close? - Oh, come on, don't. Come on, don't even point that thing here, come on man. Take it east, calm down, now. - You got a Billy living here? - We've got lots of Billys. - God, you've got my money and you're still treating me like a jerk. - I'm not being a jerk. Lots of bums come in here using that name. - Let me see your outgoing phone slips of the past few days. - Just don't fool around with that no more. - How about this one? Was this a Billy? - Yeah, that's a Billy. - Dial the number. - [Woman] Escort service. - It's an escort service. - Bingo. What's the room number? - 102. - 102. (suspenseful music) 1-900-10MIAMI. Jennifer. (door squeaking) (gunshot) (gunshots) (dogs barking) Would you be so kind as to move your truck so I can drive my car? - Hey, big man, we're looking for the wonder boy, Mack Derringer. Where is he? - Try the Yellow Pages. - Funny man. - Yeah. - Try this. (yelling) - [Hugo] Smart ass, let's go. - Get him in the car. - [Hugo] Let's go. - Hey, Mack. - [Mack] Mm-hmm. - You know that I still love you, right? - Yeah, I love you too, sweetheart, but it's a different kind of love now. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Billy] Oh, now I know where you live. - Who was that? - Just a couple of crazies that keep calling me. - [Mack] Crazies? - Yeah. (phone ringing) - Oh come on, give me a break. All right, scumbag, we're getting tired of this crap. - [Sam] My, my, such language. I have a close friend here, and he wants you to come down and play cards. - What friend? And who the hell are you? - [Sam] I'm Sam, the friend is your old buddy, Jake. Hugo and Billy Bob picked him up a little while ago. - Where is he? And where are you? - [Sam] Relax, I sent Billy Bob over to pick you up. I wouldn't want you to lose your way. - [Jennifer] Who is that? - I gotta make a run. - Where you going? - That call was about Jake. They're holding him to get to me. - All right, be careful, okay? - Are you kidding? I've been hit on the head, beat up, shot at, framed for murder, what more can happen to me? And why me? - Don't be a hero, okay, champ? - Got a piece? Give it up. - Where's Jake? - You'll find out. - Sorry we can't be here for your reunion, but Mr. Santiago's yacht's pulling out tonight. - And we don't wanna get blood all over our clothes. - Right. So long, champ. - Shit. (groaning) (punching) (yelling) - Jake. - Very good, gentlemen. You both promised me good entertainment, and you delivered. Now you both know that the greatest love that a man can have, is to die for his friend. Gonna play a little game, have a little fun. You're gonna kill him, or you're gonna kill him. Or, I'm gonna kill you both. Got it? - I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I can't die. I got to have my soul cleansed. I got to pray for forgiveness. Brother, get down here with me and pray for forgiveness. Brother get down here with me. We got to pray, and we got to ask the Lord to forgive us. Beat the gentlemen. Then forgive us for our sins. The keys are in the car, if I get it started, jump on the back, and ask for forgiveness, and please, Lord, let it be swift. And the Bible said, do good unto those who hate you, bless you. And teach those who love you to hate you more, and bless you, and bless you very much! (yelling) (tires screeching) (gunshots) (laughing) - Why don't you take me to Jennifer's house? I'll check with you later. - Well, that little punk, Billy, was the one that followed me. I went through his room. He had her number. - Yeah, well now there are two of them calling. - Two? - Yeah, two. Light's changed. - Yeah. - Stay out of trouble, Jake Jennifer? Jennifer! (phone ringing) (Jennifer groaning) - [Billy] Derringer. Now it's time for your wife to do all the things she says she loves to do. (laughing) Soft in all the right places. - You're a real sicko. - [Billy] No more teasin'. Now it's time for action. Don't move, bitch. Oh, you're a bad girl. - I'm telling you man, if you hurt her-- - [Billy] You can have fun too, just like they talk about on the phone. Come on down, she can handle it. The Foundry warehouse on the river. Oh, and come alone. (heavy breathing) - Oh. Oh, Mr. Derringer, welcome, welcome. - Mack. - The worms, they crawl in, and the worms, they crawl out. Oh, harder, harder, oh yeah. Yes. - Mack. - Mack. - What do you want? - What do I want? Let me see, what do I want. The death of Jennifer Derringer, yes. You see, she was pure, and you violated the temple of her beauty, and you caused this. You, you caused all of this. (crying) - You killed Francesca, right? - Yeah. Francesca, and... Pebbles, and Jean Claude. (laughing) (crying) Oh, damn baby. - [Mack] Let her go. - What? - Let her go. - Well, if you insist. Hold still, baby. Oh, hold still, hold still. - No. - Hold still. - Jennifer! (gunshots) (gunshots) (groaning) (laughing) - Come on, you, come on. Come on. (yelling) go on. - About time. You've been with Jennifer, I'm gonna kill you. That's a joke. Sit down, I wanna talk to you about something. - Ted-- - Let me talk, will you please? Mack, you're always so damn full of yourself. You know... I've been denying my feelings for Jennifer for a very long time, I love her. - Jennifer's dead. - That's not funny, Mack. - Not meant to be. She was killed by Billy tonight. - How do I love thee, let me count the ways. - Come on, Ted, put the piece away. - That's Elizabeth Barrett Browning, did you know that, Mack? - It's you that's been calling Jennifer, right? - You didn't love her very well, Mack. You really didn't deserve her. - Come on, put the piece away, Ted. Let's talk about this. Can I give you a ride home? I'm sorry it had to work out like this. You sure you're all right? - Yeah. - I overheard everything. He's taking it pretty hard, isn't he. Well, I think you've got the wrong take on Ted. - What do you mean? Poetry books? - Check 'em out. I went by Lenny's pad, and he wasn't there. I let myself in to wait for him. I found those. - So what are you saying? - It was Lenny who was calling Jennifer, not Ted. - Man. - Hey, where you going? - I'm going to end the friendship with Lenny. (upbeat music) - I'm learning how to speak French. (speaking French) It means very sensitive man. - I need to talk to you, pal. - It has to do with sensitivity. - I need to talk to you. - What about? - Talk over there, all right? - What is this? Don't let him upset you I'll be right back. I'll be right back. What? What? Now what? - You know something, Lenny. You always were a big dumb jerk. I'm gonna kick your butt all over South Beach. - How come? - You didn't break any laws, pal, but you sure screwed up a lot of lives. - Name one Mack, who's? - Jennifer. - Jennifer? - So I call a broad. You told me you were through with her. - We're not talking about a broad man, we're talking about Jennifer! (punching) - (laughing) I love this business! Okay. (laughing) (groaning) (yelling) - Anytime you wanna do this again, you know where to find me. (laughing) (car honking) - Hey Bruiser, come on, man. Come over here, have a drink on me. (slow reggae music) Get some alcohol on those wounds. How'd it go? - I've had better days. - He'll get over it. He'll get over it, and everything will be everything. - Yeah yeah yeah, maybe. - Maybe? I remember when we were playing the Chargers. Lance Allworth said he was gonna smoke you for two touchdowns on the Sunday game. You didn't see him ever. I didn't hear a maybe. - Yeah, I remember the game. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - Hey, I've been looking all over for you. May I join you? - Yeah, right. You can be Lenny Dawson. - Who's Lenny Dawson? (laughing) - Bambi. The League's leading passed receiver. Can The Bruiser, the greatest defensive back ever to play the game of football stop The Bruiser!
