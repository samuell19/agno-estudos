This film was made based on a true story Seoul, May 27, 2000 To tell you the truth, I don't know what to make of it. Any special symptoms or strange behaviors? Didn't you sense anything different? No, not at all. For example, was she mostly on her own, or did she try to hide something? If there was any such signs then I wouldn't be this contused. So was it 3 days ago? After watching your video tape I was greatly shocked and even confused. Whether I should believe it or not I was utterly in confusion. The fact that it happened in reality and not in some film or novel. In a word, it was unbelievable! Actually, I couldn't get any sleep last night. Even when I was coming here I wondered if it's all a dream. Yes, I know what you mean It was the same for me. You must've gone through much trouble before you decided to reveal this tape. What triggered you to finally decide to do so? Disclosing the tape and the confusion had from it. Did you think you can deal with it all? All right, then While watching the tape we'll continue with the story. FADE OUT Live footage. Hello! My name is Song HyunJu I'm 26 years old. First of all, to my father and mother who'll be watching this tape I'd like to say I'm sorry I'm sure you'll be very surprised I'm sorry about that I'm also sorry to JaeMin. And to all those who knew me I am very sorry I was suffering alone for a long time. Since I couldn't hide it any longer I decided to do this. When she wanted to tape like that Didn't you think it was strange? No, She did it before. In order to calmly confess about something. She asked me to prepare a camcorder for her. So I wasn't that suspicious when she asked me this lime. All right, then. Can you tell me in detail what happened that day? Hey! Reenactment. Get it quickly. Maeng JiEun (stand-in/pseudonym, Age 21) Call your sister, too. Come and eat. - This is - JaeMin something nobody would believe. And I have no talent to make someone believe it. - Is she coming? - Don't know. Probably will. She's not coming now? It all happened like that on that day. What's wrong? What is? Song HyunJu (stand-in/pseudonym, Age 26) Song JaeMin (stand-in/pseudonym, Age 21) Are you going out? Thought you called to eat? Yeah, right. Just tell me! Can't stand this Tell me now! Just eat. Did you scratch Dad's car again? When I went to sister's room to call her to eat. Since she had something important to say. She asked me to prepare a camcorder. Similar thing happened before She secretly took Dad's car out. Got the car door scratched and. Had to take refuge at Aunt's place. It's nothing like that. Well, shall we start? - Are you going to be there, too? - What? I'm in charge of the light. Hello My name is Song HyunJu I'm 26 years old. First of all, to father and mother who'll be watching this tape I'd like to say I'm very sorry I'm sure you'll be very surprised I'm sorry I'm also sorry to JaeMin. And to all those who know me I am very sorry I was suffering alone for a long time. Since I couldn't hide it any longer I decided to do this. Mom, Dad... Please don't worry I'm going to a good place I have my plane tickets booked. Though it is heartbreaking to leave one's family I want to find myself I don't want to live in hiding. To live hiding alone for all this time. It was too much for me to hold in. So I leave this tape I lived until now hiding it from everyone. But now I want to reveal everything I'm... different from normal people. I... Lived until now hiding ii from everyone. But now I want to reveal everything I'm different from normal people I'm a vampire I tell you once again I'm a vampire living off human blood. What? Are you joking? I knew it wouldn't be easy for you to believe it. What's wrong? It's creepy What's up with you? I'm not kidding I really am a vampire. Yeah, okay. Actually, I once thought maybe I'm the Joan of Arc... Sorry. Nothing can be done about it It's a fact that I'm a vampire I don't care if you're a vampire or not I don't care if you're going to England or Hong Kong. But it's Sunday today Sunday is... ...a resting day for mind and soul that's tired from the week. But what kind of Sunday is this? Do university-entrance repeaters rest every day? Does such a good-weathered Sunday come again? All right. What the... Does Korean vampires bite on themselves? What are you doing? - Was it real blood? - Yes, it was real blood. - Did the blood spurt out? - Yes, it really spurted out. How did it spurt out? BlobBlob. BlobBlob... Tell us what happened next. Though it was strange. It seemed that JiEun accepted that my sister's a vampire. Thinking that it could be the comfortable thing to do. I decided to believe her for the time being. Back then, I was just surprised. So surprised It was really surprising. The fact that a vampire was in the house. And that vampire was someone I knew I just knew her as a normal quiet person. Anyway, I was so surprised. And I began to get curious about her. - Were you a vampire from birth? - Yes, I think so. It might sound strange... but I'm not quite sure. When did you first realize you were a vampire? That was... in Grade 2, I think. Back then, there was a boy who always followed me around. One day, he came over to our house. We were running about in our small yard. Huh? I wiped the blood from his nose. The blood was on my finger. The smell of blood and the warm... ...sticky feeling. Was it tasty? When did you first suck blood? 2nd year of high school. He was my math tutor. It was raining that day. Mom was out at the department store sale. Or was it snowing? In other words, addition means to add. So one plus one is two two plus two becomes four four plus.. hey! - Yes? - I'll start over. Addition means to add. One plus one becomes two. Two plus two... I'll start over. Addition is... It might be different for each vampires. But I get the urge to suck blood when it's raining or snowing. Four plus four is eight. Eight plus eight is... Fifteen? No, it's sixteen. It happened even then. I suddenly started to feel hazy. Oh, where does my great teaching come from? While feeling with my whole body my tutor's passionate lecture. I fell my desire growing bigger and bigger. Especially, when his veins were standing out. When he was showing his veins. Again... Two times two is four. Two times three is six Two times four is..what? Tell me. - I felt really sorry for him. - Why? What happened? He was anemic. Do vampires eat apples? - She even eats garlic well. - Garlic? In films, they run away when they see garlic. They're all lies. Just because you're a vampire, you can't just live on blood. And what can Koreans eat if they hate garlic? Everything has garlic in it. You can say everything in films or novels are lies. One vampire I know is a deacon in church, and... not everyone becomes one just because they got bit. But why England? Aren't there more vampires in countries like Poland? First, I started to call close friends. And told them that I was a vampire. - I meant to tell you... - What? Actually, I'm a vampire. Really? A while ago, (What should I do?) I told a very close friend (Why don't you go to England?) I was worried what if she gets upset or avoid me. But unexpectedly she told me this. "Oh, really? Then you should immigrate to England". She said her uncle was a vampire. He revealed himself to his family and went to England. I'm planning to stay there for a while. And think of what I should do in the future. So were you convinced that she was a vampire? Did you maybe think otherwise? What do you mean? Well, you know. For example, thinking oneself as a dog, he can growl or. Even bite like a dog when he feels endangered. Is there really someone like that? It's a kind of a mental illness. Getting back to the story, Was there a decisive occasion that made you believe her? Yes, since it was hard it just believe only by her words. We decided to actually see her in action. Now, it's 11:30 pm. We'll randomly pick one person. And actually show the blood-sucking in action. My sister says, It doesn't necessarily have to be night for the vampires to get in action. But since it's better without the crowd. We'll carry on our experiment now. First, that student in the phone booth. She'll be our guinea-pig. Though vampires are known to like young women's blood. There really isn't any preference. But they are more sought after. Because their blood is more clear than men's. Are you ready, sister? Now, we'll start the experiment. She's walking toward the phone booth. Looking around, she's walking there to suck blood. She looks great and even cool. She discovers the student. She looks around one more time. Without suspicion, the student's just calling. She went inside the booth. She bites! The student's resisting Bites again! Resisting again. My sister diverts her eyes She bit her! She's sucking away. She's still sucking... Sucking a lot, right now. Ouch, lots oi mosquitoes. Now I think she's done sucking. She got up. Coming out of the booth Wiping her lips once. Okay! She's calling me to come I better go over there, Wait. - Come on. - What? - Quick. - All right, all right. Hey, Where are you going? Hey, kid Look over there I'll call you later. It hurts. Vampire's brother. Vampire's brother's friend. Blood-sucked Junior High Student. Did it hurt a lot? No, it didn't hurt much. But was she really a vampire? If she wasn't, then why did she suck your blood? How thick are you! Want some? No, I'll have a cigarette, too. Sorry, but light, please? How did it feel when you were being sucked blood? I don't know It was... ...tingly and numbing. Like it was...well, you know. It's like that. Is it like donating blood? Of course not! How can you compare with that? Didn't you get bit, yet? What? No, not yet... Then am I the only one who got bit here? Yeah.. Sorry. If you're curious, you get bit yourself. But I'm not becoming a vampire, am I? In films, bitten people become vampires, loo. They say everything in films are all lies. They say vampires are mutant heredity. - I'm going home. - What? Thanks for everything. - Okay, bye. - Get home safe. Bye. - Put our your cigarette. - cigarette? Step on it. - Bye. - Bye. Now, can you believe me? And so, that's howl came to believe my sister as a vampire. Hyunju... How hard it must've been for you all this while. Not being able to say that you're a vampire. Thinking how sad and lonely your days must've been. My heartached. When I went to see that Dracula film with you I'm sorry that I said that it was disgusting. If I knew even a bit, I wouldn't have said so. In the future, if I meet another vampire I won't say so I promise. Hyunju... I think I can understand you now. And I love you. One, two, three, four. With my loved one. Who'll leave a! daybreak. As we share our last love sadness takes over happiness. For my sister who's going to England. We were going to have a very happy exciting party. But. We couldn't. We were. Sad. Those who's leaving us. They seem so cold-hearted. Though we'll await their return. The longing is unbearable. But why did I blow them out? Let's eat. Bye, 'sis. Take care. HyunJu... Up to here is the whole story in the tape of my sister. How did your parents react after watching the tape? They're dumbfounded They still can't believe it. Actually, that goes for me, too. But... is there something different since it happened? Biggest difference would be... Then, what am I? That sort of thinking would be the difference. That's something different I'm sorry but I still cannot believe it. A bit perplexing and a bit funny, too. Well, the world accepts only what we allow. Thank you. LIGHT OUT At present, at August 2000, She lives in a small town of Ken Hamster region in Northern England. With vampires of various countries around the world. HyunJu. HyunJu. - Did you call me? - Were you asleep? No. You must be tired. Yeah, a bit. Get some sleep since you have a morning ﬂight. That nightgown suits you well I couldn't wear it 'cause it was small for me if you want, you can have it. HyunJu. Yeah? I have a favor to ask you. A favor? I'm curious about something. And if you go, then I'll live on being curious about it. What is it? Can you suck me just once? What it's like... I'm so curious about what it's really like. Can you suck me just once? Well... Sorry. You must be full from all the sucking today. Stupid. Sucking blood doesn't necessarily make your stomach full. Really? Okay. - But only a little. - Really? Thank you. How should I be? Where do you wan! me to bile? A scar will remain, right? How about my butt? You can't because it has too much fat. It's better to bite where veins are close to the skin. And my dogtooth's not that long. Then where are the veins well seen? Let's see now. Let's do it like this I'll tell you where it's good to bite on and you pick where. Number one. Number two. And number three. Number four. Number four. It'll hurt more since it's very sensitive area. Are you sure? Come, sit here. How should I sit? Get your legs out this way. Yeah, a bit more. More. We'll lift your nightgown. A bit closer. Cut out. Director KIM Jee Woon
