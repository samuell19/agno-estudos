Hey, Mike, come here. Pops, I'm getting ready for church. What? What do you mean "what?" What, what is it? It's like a lake in here. Pop, what? This is so stupid. Son, the water is supposed to stay in the shower. Pops, my entire life there has been water on this floor when I get outta the shower. Okay, show me how you shower. I wanna watch this ritual. I get in the shower... and I turn the water on. You don't tuck in the shower curtain? - No. - You're supposed to. Pops, the floor is still gonna get wet. No, it's not gonna get wet. That's what the curtain is for. - Yes, it is. The floor's gonna get wet. - It's not gonna get wet. I've showered my whole life, and it's longer than yours. When you put the shower curtain in, it doesn't get wet. - I don't know, okay. - Not okay. This can ruin the floor. This is a problem, okay? You just run around and just jump outta the shower, you don't care that it's wet? What does this look like, a locker room to you? - Pops, I'm gonna go to church. - Look at this, it's terrible! This is terrible. It's a lack of respect, look at the shower curtain. What do you think the curtain's for? You just sit there with the shower open? You're nuts. I close the shower curtain, I just don't tuck it in. You gotta tuck it in, otherwise you end up like this. You're a genius. Oh my gosh, are they giving out IQ tests? Maybe we should forget about college. I'm right here. Lets go y'all. Lets go crew. Hey Mike, you got that shit. Come on! You better not fuck this up. You already know what you should do. Get your bitch ass out the way! You watch how you talk to me! Get the fuck out the way! Just stay out of the fucking way that's all I need you to do. - I'm not asking! - Hey, well it's not my problem either. Seriously, you have to get it now? What is it, magic hour? Oh I'm gonna get numbers on you motherfuckers. Hey, we got that shit right here bro! What you doing? Goddamn it! No! Stop! No, this is over! You guys gotta go! It's over. Get out right now. - You got to go. - That's what I told 'em. That's what I told 'em. Let us pray. There are many times in life where we think we are alone, but Jesus is there. You're never alone. As we achieve our goals, Jesus is there. As we build relationships, also, He is there. As we break relationships, He is there. Please respond: "Lord, hear our prayer," for anyone seeking love. We pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayers. For our clergy who wished to travel the world. We pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. Please turn to your neighbor and bestow peace. May the body of Christ be with you? Amen. The body of Christ be... Hey, Rachel. Amen. Did you see Rachel out there? Yeah, she's fire. You won't do anything about it though. I won't. I gotta be a pro skater. I gotta focus. Michael, a word. Michael. First of all, congrats on graduating high school. What an accomplishment, young man. Thank you. As you may already know, Michael I can't be using you or your friends as altar boys here at the church anymore. - Archdiocese rules. - I... I know, but, you always have an adult altar server. - So I was thinking if Frank was to step down... - That's all well and good I mean, but Frank's been part of the seminary for two years now. Were you looking to be a priest? We're here at the 50th annual North Hollywood Skate Park Barbecue. We got Isaiah Jordan, Nolan Knox. We having a good time. Ooh! Don't blow my spot up, nigga.

We'll get your hundred pushups done. Drop down, knock them out. Then we'll get back to practice. I'm not doing a hundred pushups. I'm five minutes late. What do you mean you're not... you know the rules. You show up to Coach Cole's practice late, you drop and you give a hundred minimum. I'm not doing that. I'm five minutes late, all right? Have you lost your mind? Stop. It's a hundred today, a hundred tomorrow. Every day for the rest of the week. Damn! They got ya out here doing pushups. - You're pissed. - I'm fucking hot.

Can we turn this TV down? - No! I don't like straining to hear it. - You need more ice. - Ice is fine, pops. That one's dry. You need another ice pack. - Pops, this ice pack is fine. - Just gimme the ice pack. All right well I'm gonna turn down the TV, how about that? Why is this skateboard against the wall? What are you... what are you talking about? Skate wheels leave marks. Pops, there's no mark on that wall. - There's no mark?! - It's dust. Dust. - Oh, there's no mark on the wall? - There is no mark on the wall, I don't see one. Damn son! That shiner's serious. Next time I'm gonna beat that kid's ass. I'm gonna get... I'm gonna... Right hand. Right hand. Straight punch. Straight punch. Good. All right. Good. Now move your head. Move your head like this. Look, watch. Just go like this first, just move. Move your head.

Pick a side. Pick a side. That's it, pick a side. Right hand over the top. Boom. That's it. What if that big guy gets a hold of ya? Huh? You're not excused yet. Let me see it. - Just get off me. - Well do it! Let's see what you got, boy. What you got? - Get off! - You see it? All right good job, good job, good job. You know, I love you son. I know. I'm just trying to toughen you up. I know. When I was a kid, everybody hit you. The nuns, neighbors, Little League coach would hit you. You played Little League? Of course! When I was a kid, Bing Crosby moved into North Hollywood and he donated a ton of money to Weddington Park. You know him and Bob Hope, they had the best houses to trick or treat at when I was a kid. I swear to God. Wait who's Bob Hope? What did you say? Bob Hope with the soldiers, Bob Hope. The guy the airport is named after. Bob... yeah, I know Bob Hope. Come on. My mother would roll over in her grave if you didn't know who Bob hope was. She loved Bob Hope. When I was a little kid, she'd watch that Bob Hope show every night... and the Joey Bishop. She loved that Joey Bishop show. I'm gonna be on TV one day too, pops. How the fuck are you gonna be on TV? Pops, I'm telling you I'm nice on the board. You're nice on the board? When'd you start talking like that? Pops, I'm serious. I'm serious too. Speak the King's English. You hang out at that damn park too much. Pops I'm at the park filming. You know, sponsors see these videos. It's like, I'm goin' to work. Son, that's not work! You need to be on education and school. Look, when I was a kid my mom told me to be a postman because it had steady pay and had good benefits. For me as a little kid it was way too far fetched. Pops, Pops. I hear this all the time. Okay, look it. I'm gonna go to college, but I'm also gonna skate. Your focus is gonna be on college. I just said I'm gonna go to college. No, you didn't. You said college and skating and you can skate, I guess, but your focus needs to be going to college. All right. All right. I hear you. Hey, where are you going? This thing's almost done cooking. OK, look at you! Oh my god. Holy shit! Oh my boy all dressed up for once. What'd you expect? My boy tryi" to smash something tonight? Oh, fo' sho'. Hell nah, man. I respect the ladies. All right? I get dressed up. Get the haircuts. That's why women love me, all right? Once I fix the acne... - Definitely need to fix that. - I'm gonna be perfect. That's one of my favorite words, right, Adolf? - Why is that? - "Perfect." Because if you look up in the dictionary, the word "perfect," Jay pops up. Bro, I'm a sculpture, baby. 10 out of 10. I'm sexy as fuck dude. You're solid three bro. I'm a three? I'm a... I'm a... if I'm a three, you're negative 20,000. W-Where the fuck did that number come from? Where the fuck did you... Where the fuck did you come from, Michael? All the ladies think I'm sexy. Lindsay, Lacy, Brittany, Jessica, Adolf. - Okay. - All of 'em. - Okay. Not me. - No, no. All of 'em! - Okay, not me though... - Hey, schmoney... I think I'm... schmoney! That's right. Have you never heard that that makes it worse? Bro, it doesn't matter. I've tried everything. You need to try harder. Bro, I've tried pills, Proactiv, toothpaste, all that shit. Oh, it's a cold world! I mean this in all honesty, you should get face tatts. Cover 'em all up. Bro, a face tat might work. See, my dad always said he'd never put a bumper sticker on a Ferrari. So, you're a Ferrari. Yeah, I'm a Ferrari. Oh, okay. Yes. Psych... Hey, Michael. What's up? Y'all good? Good. Here you go, love. What's up Jay? Hey, gorgeous how you doing? Dude. Haven't you been trying to get with Rachael since like the second grade? Shut the fuck up, all right? Fun fact about me and Rachel we made passionate sex in fifth grade. - Well, that's true story. - Bro, what? It was fifth grade "Spin the Bottle." A kiss in fifth grade is sex. Yeah, we had intercourse. We had the intercourse. Bro, seriously. I have three months to seal the deal, all right, before she goes to college. Don't fuck this up for me. So why do you guys all wear the same shoes? Oh, it's our skate crew thing. Did you ever skate with any girls? I mean we would, but girls suck. Seriously? Oh no, no. I'm serious. Like dead serious. Hold on. You're for real, trying to say that not one girl skater is better than a guy skater. Not one. That's exactly what I'm saying. What about that one girl Norabeth in sales? I mean, she's good. But compared to Ishod Wair, there's no competition there. Yeah, well that little Brazilian girl, Haisa, she better than you. I don't even know who the fuck that is. She's for sure not better to me. I just think it's so fucked up you make the blanket statement - not one girl's better. - Mmm. Okay. Don't get me wrong, like I'm pro girl. Like... I love me some girls. I just cannot lie to you. A girl can do anything a guy can do. That's just where we differ. I'm sorry. That's probably not the only place we differ. Bitch! Rachel, what the fuck? Come on. - Oh, shut the fuck up. - ...up. Shut the fuck... You're not funny, bro. Shut yo' dumb ass up. - Fuck you bitch. - Fuck you bitch. Hey guys, your friends over there sent this for you. Fuck! You guys are crazy. That's what I love about North Hollywood. You know? You see your friends, community... It's a nice neighborhood. - You're gonna stay here forever? - Hell no. What, you think you're too good for it or something? No, it's not that. I wanna see the world, you know? No, I think you think you're too good for NoHo. Yeah. Well maybe if you guys took your thumbs out your butts, you can do it too. Yeah. Maybe if you take your thumbs out of your buttholes... - then you can do it too. - Yeah, you're gonna be mad when I'm balling, going on vacations and shit. - I already go on vacations. - Hot! Yeah, but your fucking... your parents pay for that shit, all right. You don't... you don't even know what I'm talking about. You didn't have to walk me to my car. I'm a gentlemen. Don't be surprised. Yeah. Yeah. That's a nice car. This was fun. For sure. Oh my God! Okay, bye! So what you been on man? Still doing that altar service shit? Nah, you remember father Jesse? Yeah, bro. Off tops. He said we're too old to altar serve now. Damn. Hey, so I know you know Nolan and Isaiah, was wondering if you could maybe introduce me to 'em. Bro, I was with 'em yesterday. I was trying to say your name and shit. I don't know why you didn't come over. Where's this motherfucker going? Just looked super busy, you know? I didn't wanna... interrupt you guys. But if there's any a time I can go skate with you guys... I'm super down. Good, bro. - I'll let you know. - A'ight. Word. Seriously, like any time, I'll take a bus wherever. - I'm super down. - It's all good, bro. Just don't be thirsty about it. I'm not being... I'm not being thirsty, all right. Mike, are you wearing a sweater and shorts? - What? - Why aren't you wearing pants? Pops. You can wear shorts and a sweater. That doesn't make any sense. Wear pants and a shirt. What if my arms get cold? Where were you this morning? I was at the park. Why, why what's up? Well, because Coach Healey called while you were out, and he said that you quit. Pops, I... I love water polo, but you know, I gotta focus on skating. You need structure, and you need to put your focus right now on college. - I can do both. - You better do both. You better not just do the skate. Where are you going today? I'm gonna go skate. You gotta get on top of these college applications. They're not gonna do themselves. - That's trash. - What was that? - I said that's trash. - What was that? Get your ass over here. Try me. Get those applications done. Adolf! Open the window. Michael, what the hell are you doing? Hi! Uh, I'm sorry! Is Adolf home? Damn. Why are you looking at it like that? It ain't gonna bite you. - Bro, just fucking try it. - People eat this? I'm from Lafayette, Louisiana, see. That's the way we eat. Crawfish etouffee, gumbo, boudin... Well I would, I just... I ate... not too long ago, so... I'm full. Pops man, this nigga just picky as fuck. This what? Oh, I'm sorry... brother picky as fuck. Too late. Cha-ching. This his new thing. Every time I say the word "nigga," he make me do ten fucking pushups. That'll be twenty, cha-ching. - I'm taking the babies to camp. - All right, baby. Y'all still goin' skating? Since you always say I steal your your fuckin' lighter. I'm good. - Everyone talks about how you're good at skating. - He also has a tiny penis. I know you have the smallest penis. I can see it in your shorts. - I can see the outline. - Don't fucking look at my dick, bro. - I'm not looking, I can just see it. The tip. - Don't look at my dick. Could you bring a Backwood next time? Damn. - What do you mean "damn?" Backwoods? - Nobody smoke those. We don't have Backwoods. What are we? Right? This guy thinks we're rappers. We think we're rappers. We're not rappers. You don't want to hang out over here. It's super nice over here, I'm just sayin'. Nothing's gonna happen. Why would things roll uphill? - Thatt's impossible. - No, it's gonna happen. Everybody knows a bunch of kids died here in the 50s and then they push things uphill. Well, it's clearly not working right now. - It's gonna work. - Yeah, this is isn't happening. You guys, look! Okay. So I got a joke. Knock knock... Who's there? - Europe? - Europe who? No, I'm not. What the fuck is that? Bro, when you tell a bad joke, you gotta put it in the tray. All right? So pay up. I didn't think it was that bad of a joke, but fuck y'all. Fuck you... It's okay, love bird. - Hot Crunchies! - Hot Crunches are so bad for you. These are my favorite chips. - Okay. - I like those too. See, look. So what do you get here? I would get kombucha, but they just don't have it here. Well, have you tried Just Water? - No. - Well I just put you on. No you didn't. I don't care about Just Water. See, you say that, but next time you come here you're gonna get it. So I put you on. It's okay. I put you on. It's all good. You know, you can grab one if you want. Bro... You said you would take me out. Let's go. Take me out. As soon as you... I don't need to go through this. Take it back. Man, my board is so trash. Damn... That was good. Bro, if you're not gonna skate keep your fucking board over there. Fuck, this swelbow bussin'. Bro, you gotta stop making excuses. Bro, shut the fuck up. So Mike, you want to go eat? I can't afford that shit. - Okay. I got money. - Okay... - I'm... like I'll pay for you. - He's sayin' like... It's all good. I'll pay for you, you're my brother. I got you bro. - Bro, just come! - Like, I'll spot you. Bro, you're good. Don't worry about me, all right? I'm gonna stay here. See you when you get back, all right. Can I have some of your water? Yeah. You got a waterfall. - What's that? - Look... like this? Okay. I don't... I don't like when people put their lips on my drink. Okay. Fine, here. I don't even want it anymore. Okay? You can have it. Wow. How was the rest of your day? Did you go skating with the guys? I just wish they took shit more seriously. Well maybe they don't care about skating like you do. Maybe they care about other things. Yeah, but the things they care about aren't gonna make 'em any money. I promise, money won't fix all your problems. I'm not saying I want to be Puff Daddy, but at least like a bigger house or something. I grew up in a big house. It's cold. I'm not saying live in a tiny house but at least you can feel like other people live there. That shit smells. This is sage. Your aura needs this. You're burning sage. You wouldn't even understand what I'm talking about. You grew up with the money. How do you know how I grew up? I'm gonna get this whole house. Why don't you tell me how you grew up? Well, we didn't always live in Toluca Lake. We used to live in Chatsworth in this shitty farm style house. Then my dad hit it big at work and we moved to the house we live in now. See, I didn't know. Now I know. I'ma hit it big too. Do you ever doubt yourself? - Nope. - Come on. - Never? - Sometimes I do. My dad doesn't believe. My friends don't give a fuck. Yeah, I do. It's hard not to. Your competition, Michael. Okay. You've got this. Fucking get it. - Get hyped, right? - All right, man. - Motherfucker! - Yo, what's up, Mikey? Do you want a beer fool? Brett, I don't drink. You know that. Shit, mo' for me then. Catch you, bro. Who is that dude? Some bum from the neighborhood I've known since middle school. He knows Nolan Knox and Isiah? Yeah. - What's up? - You good, man? Yeah man. Why don't you ask him to introduce you guys? I did. Well, I tried at least. Damn, that's crazy. So you're... you're calling him a bum behind his back but you wanted him to introduce you to the pros? No, no, no, no. Look he's the homie. All right. He's a homie, but he's a bum. He knows he's a bum. I will call him a bum to his face. Contest on the double set! Go! Oh my god... Yo, Mike is fucking workin' it right now, fool. He is too. Holy shit. You really killed it today, man. It was, it was sick to see. We should, we should go skate some time. Yeah, I'm down. Just grab my number from Walker, man. What? You said my name, bro. Yeah, I'm just saying you should bring him out skating with us, man. Yeah, all right... Let's go, man. We been here all fucking day. The fuck is his deal, man? Don't pay that shit no mind. Those your friends over there? - Yeah. - Y'all wear the same shoes? Yeah. It's you just... been doing it since we were like kids. It's cute. You see my family moved to North Hollywood from Mississippi in the 1960s. A lot of people who moved to California from the South were craftsmen. My father did stucco work. Your mother's father he poured cement. And you know it was passed on like that. Here, put these on. No. Well pour a little more lime in there please. I think a leaf got in there. You might want to pull that out. Pops, there's no leaf in this cement. No, at the bottom there is, and it affects the cement. It won't settle correctly. It's better with no leaf. You want me to get the leaf? - Well, you got to. - Fucking... It's a, uh... concern. Oh, fuck! Rule number one: When pouring cement is lime burns, always wear gloves. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hello? So you down to come skating with Nolan and Isiah tomorrow? Yeah, yeah. Meet us at the stair, bro. Yeah, Westfield Mall... Nah, not Westfield, bro. The one at the school. Yeah, yeah, I can do that. - Give me... - Who's that? Good, good. Sounds good. My counselor. All right, yeah. See you then. Peace. Bro, I think I just cracked my board. Be safe! You got it. Oh, fuck!

Just all right down the middle. - All these. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, please. That's a lot of boards. Yeah, nah, I know. I'm like... I'm super indecisive. I'm as indecisive as it gets. - Right? - All right. I have Baker boards. They don't have that much concave. Oh, no worries. No worries. Yeah. You can just stack them up. Can I bother you to get the two up top though? - That one right there? - Yeah. Oh yeah. That, those two up there. Just right up. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Those'll... those'll do right there. Yeah.

Run run run! Go go go! Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey... Mike, where's the board? I left it. Mike... you did... You did what? - You left it?! - Why the fuck would you leave it?! Because I thought we'd get caught! Because... well we didn't get caught, did we? What the fuck do you think y'all doing? It's a motherfucking mall, y'all thought y'all was gonna get away? I should have never listened to you guys. We're here because of you. We're here for you. Oh, you're here for me? Thanks so much, man. Thanks. Yo y'all shut up back there. My fuckin' dad is gonna kick my ass. Who gives a shit, man? I was supposed to skate with some people today. Who's you gonna skate with? Why does it matter? You can't tell me who you was gonna skate with? - Bro, it doesn't fucking matter. - Bro, it's not that hard. Just tell me who the fuck you were gonna skate with. You a weirdo. I was gonna skate with Nolan and Isiah, all right, man? Happy? Is that what you wanna know? You dickride them heavy as fuck. - Oh my God. - You're just fucking jealous. Shut the fuck up talking to me, you sound dumb. From now on, you're gonna help me out. I want your focus to be 100% on your damn future. Now that's either college or it's gonna be a spot next to my ass on the construction site. Pops, it was a mix-up. I didn't even do anything. You were there. What does it matter? Now you're on lockdown. There's no going out. There's no skateboarding. There's no nothing. That's it. You're doing it wrong. You need to create a depression in the middle of the tub. You never showed me how to do it, so... You never asked me. Here, let me show you. See? Otherwise it's like you're jerking off. Hey, can't work today. I've got to go meet with my counselor. We only worked one day. Pops, Pops. I'm gonna go meet my counselor, you know? We're gonna talk about a bunch of schools I'm on the wait list for. That's what you want me to do, right? Why... Why are you lying to me? I know you were about to go skate. Pops, I swear to God... Don't swear to God. Son, I'm not an idiot. Pops, I'm gonna go to school, see my counselor and then I'm gonna come home. Okay? I missed you the other day, man. Dude, my bad, me and my pops got in some shit. All good, bro. Pack it up. Let's go! Ah, let's get out of here. Wait, why? Security's right there, bro. Yeah, we'll just tell him to call the cops and get a couple more tries. Bro, just put yourself in our shoes for just a second. We got big sponsors that pay us. If we get... Scared to fight a security guard? What? I was just making a joke that you're too scared to fight the security guard. What... what do you mean, though? Why would we fight a security guard? All right... Bro, this nigga, bro. Fuck. - Yo, Michael man... - What, bro? Check it out right quick. Come over here. No, we gotta go. Just come over here. Sit down for a second. Let me tell you something. What man? Look, bro... For your own good, just like chill out a little bit. You know what I'm saying? Like... you're getting too comfortable. What are you talking about? I'm talking about these... these cats is professional, man. They don't, they don't, they don't fuck around like that. Making me look bad. You know what I'm saying? All right, bro. All right. Guys, I'm serious. Pack it up. We gotta go. All right, bro. We out of time. Let's go. You think Isiah's mad at me? Yeah, but he'll get over it, man. Paul for six. Can't believe I've never been here. You're gonna love this place, come here all the time. We usually go to Burritos el Chavo. Dude, that place sucks. What's up, Louie? I'll sit over here. Yo, you've been to that abandoned apartment down by Cahuenga, foo? Isn't a place like a crack house. Nah, foo. That's the chill spot, bro. You got to come down and kick it. I'll show you, bro. Hello? - Wow, man, I can't believe yo' ass not in jail. - Shut up. - Hey man, we gonna link at the skate park if you free. - I can't do that. All right, man, well just come hang out with us or something for a bit. Look, Nolan and Isiah hit me up. I had to tell them no, all right? Like... my dad's not letting that happen. Okay, so, what about tonight? Bro, what did I just... I can't. All right? Just give it like a week. All right, man. Just hit us up when you're free, Mr. Busy. Hey, son, come help me real quick. Look, you got a glass in here. You can't put the glass and mix it up. Pops, why? Why do you still do this? Isn't each can worth like 10 cents. Oh Mr. Casual. What are you too goddamn good to recycle? I'm not saying I'm too good to recycle. It's just... Well, I don't want to stoop down and bother you here. Am I embarrassing you in front of the neighborhood? No, I'm just, you know... you could do better stuff with your time. Make a little more money. How was the counselor? The counselor went pretty good, you know? He said a couple more sessions... be on the right track to... right track to college. Well, good... Hope you're hungry. Are you're gonna say grace? Lord, hear our prayers... Speak up. Lord, hear our prayers. May you watch over this food we are about to receive for the nourishment of our bodies. In the name of father, son, Holy spirit. Amen. Taste it. Just try it. How is it? - It's good. - What? It's good. Savor it. You don't clean up your act... it'll be your last. - You clearly fucking moved! - Bro. Bro, bro. - You clearly fucking moved! - Bro, found you out! Here, give me your hand. My mom went to Africa once. You never really talk about her. It's like I got all my best traits from her. She always told me to be unique and follow my dreams. I wish I had a lot more time with her. Is that Adolf? It's a family thing. Everybody. You got a big meeting today. - What... what meeting? - Well, I know a doctor and being that you're going to college soon, I thought she could give you some tips in life. Doctor? What doctor do you know? Just get dressed. Do you know how to tie a tie? Come on, get up man. Let's go. I don't know what the... here let me show you. Okay. So keep the small part here. Right around that little bird chest there. Okay? All right, watch. Wrap it around, keep your finger here so you make a hole. Bring it right around. Come through then go right through the little hole here. - Boom. Got it. - Mm-hmm. - Sure? - Yeah. I think I got it. Yeah? Okay. You ready? You excited? - Yeah. - Okay. Get excited. - Get excited. - I'm excited! I believe in you. Do me a favor, do me a favor. Get dressed and meet me outside, okay? What a great day. Great day. Can you come meet us at the park, Mike? We're gonna skate spots, we got a filmer today. I would love to film today, but my dad's making me go to this meeting. All right. You wanna link up after? No, I, I can't hang, period. Well, I mean maybe I could come to the park later and then... No, I can't. I can't, I can't get out today. My bad, bro. Okay. All right. Love you, man. Later. Look at that tie. I mean, you know you didn't have to get all dressed up for me, right? My dad insisted. You seem pretty young. How do you, how do you know my dad? Oh, you know, he did a little work for me on the house, but we're really good friends. He's awesome. Your dad is so great. Yeah. He's awesome. So how's it going with all the SAT scores and applying for board and room and everything? - Uh, my SAT scores were... they were pretty good. - Mm-hmm. I... I haven't applied yet. You didn't apply yet? You didn't apply for boarding? Are you planning to go to school in LA? Just haven't decided, still trying to figure it out. We can talk like adults, right? - What? - Like adult to adult. Sure. Okay. So... you're not going to college. No, but I am going to college... for sure. What's your SAT score? I don't give a fuck if you go to college or not. I'm not your dad. All right. Look. I want to be a pro skater. - There we go! - That's what I want to do. - Okay. - I know I can do it. Sweet. That's great. How are you gonna do it? Well, you... you kinda just skate and then like you know the right people... and then sponsors just pay you. Yeah. So I did go to college and I did everything you're supposed to do. But none of that actually meant anything because unless you work really fucking hard you're not gonna get anywhere. So no matter what you do, just apply yourself. That's facts. - What? - I said "that's facts." Hmm? "It's facts." Yeah. Like it's... it's a true statement. It's factual. - Yeah. - Yeah, it is. Can I get a peanut? - Uh-huh... - Thank you. First time you call me it's for a ride. You're so fake. Yeah... my bad. You're right. You want a bite? Oh, I can put my hands on your nachos? I know you're weird about germs. Come meet us at the park, Mike? I'd love to come today, but my dad's making me go to this meeting. Wanna hook up after? No, I can't hang, period. I mean, maybe I can come to the park later... No, I can't... I can't get out today. Bye, bro. - You're awfully quiet today. - Am I? Yo, Michael! - Oh, fuck! Fuck, fuck. - What? I think I just saw Michael. I don't want to... I don't want them to see me dressed like this. You know... I look to... Well, just tell them about the meeting. Mikey! Where you going, brotha! I told 'em I can't leave the house today, okay? Don't be scarey. What the fuck? I thought you had a meeting. I-I did, I had the meeting. Nah, but you said you couldn't hang. You're clearly hanging with Rachel. Wassup, Rachel, how are you doing? I was just giving him a ride. She was just gonna give me a ride home. But you said you had a meeting, that you couldn't hang, and now here you are in this little alleyway hanging out with Rachel. That's... that's where I'm confused. We're, we're confused. I mean, I don't want to speak for you, but... - I just gave him a ride. - She was just giving me a ride. All right, look it, we're going home right now. I'll be in the car. Bro, I swear. It is not like that. All right, man, we got to go. - Wait, where y'all going? - Why does it matter? You're grounded. Maybe I can sneak out. I can speak for myself. - What? - In the alley with your friends. You just kept talking over me, and I don't need you to talk for me. Sorry. I've never really thought about it like that. So what's going on with Jay and Adolf? Are you guys okay? I've been skating with these pros lately. Why don't you just take them skating with you? I mean, what's the harm? Look, I love Jay and Adolf... but I don't want them to embarrass me. You know, I'm really trying to make it with these guys. Yo, I'm sorry bro. I really did have a meeting. We're not tripping. Yeah, no I'm not tripping at all. Do you want to come to the show with me and Jay later? I wish I could, but I have to be home by sunset. You know, my dad would kill me if he comes home and I'm out. Only the gray's available. So... only the front row. Yeah, basically. Yeah. Sorry, I thought there'd be more movie tickets. I'll pay your cover. I'm not a charity case, all right? You don't have to pay for me. Well, that's one way to leave. The Garden's amazing. It's so funny you like The Garden. I like a lot of things you probably don't know I like. I've never seen you at any shows. I used to go to The Smell, but I always just felt like a poser. I don't feel like that right now, though. Come on, bro. You gotta let me in, man. Just wait on the side for me. Come on. Oh, fuck. - All right, but I'm on the list. - There is no list. What's up, man? Look, let me get in with you guys, man. This motherfucker acting like I'm not on the list and shit. We're actually just paying to get in. These motherfuckers ain't paying for shit, bro. You don't know who this is, man? - This the hottest... - I told you not to fucking touch me. I'm sorry... I'm sorry about this. Bro, relax, it's not that fucking serious. I'm just telling you, this is the hottest young skater. I told you not to fucking touch me. Oh my goodness, bro. Get your fucking filthy hands off of me. Get inside, guys. Come on. - Damn, bro. Relax. - Go! Not that serious. Go ahead, Michael. You good, bro. Michael! - Are you serious, bro? - Mike! What's up, bro? You gonna lie to me twice in a day? Literally twice in a day. Bro, Rachel called, all right? It was random. - Hello, Rachel. - I need to talk to you. What? This constant lying shit bro, it's actually starting to piss me off. Bro, I'm not lying for no reason. Rachel's really starting to get to your head, huh? Bro, Rachel always wants me to hang out with you guys, but I can't do that. And what is that reason? You act like a fucking kid, and it's embarrassing. You're changing, bro. Watch yourself around me. So, this is our warehouse. It's also a skatepark in the back or whatever. See, this is what my dad doesn't get, man. He never will, either. My parents still don't get what I do. Yeah, get it in, son! That's what I'm talking about! Yeah, boy, let's go. What's up with bro? How the fuck I'ma just see you here, very random. Bro, that's my bad. Nolan and Isaiah hit me up. Yeah? You actin' brand-new already, foo. You going to college or what? No, I'm about to focus on skating. It's hard to make a job skating out here, playa. What do you mean? You know, a lot of motherfuckers, they try to go pro, end up working in like a skate shop or some shit. Yeah. That's not gonna happen to me. I mean... you say that now, but... you gotta know it's not just the skating, it's... it's politics in this shit, too. What do you mean "politics?" I don't know, man. Just gotta fuckin' know the right people, be in the right circles and weird shit like that. You smoke, bro? You good, bro? Thanks for bringing me here. Yeah, man. Just trying to show you what's up. Do you know anything about stones? No. This one, it's called carnelian, and it's supposed to help with luck. This is a sunstone. It's supposed to bring you success. I personally always carry that one with me. And this is citrine. It's for focus. And this one's rose quartz. It's for truth. I wanted you to have these two. Look... see it? Watch. Wow. That was cool. Thanks for telling me about this. You know, I don't... I don't know anything about rocks. - They're called stones. - Whatever. What else do you like to do beside skating? I like to draw. What do you like to do? Smoke. Can you smoke? It's good. Hey, don't pass my shit. - Why? I can't hit it. - Nah. Put a little more. Since when do you drink? You want some? Wassup, you got new clothes? - This new? - Yeah, my dad got them for me. Your dad got you these unreleased clothes? You're doing it again. You're lying. It's bullshit. I just, I didn't want to look like a show-off, all right? Man... For real, Nolan and Isiah took me to the warehouse. Dude. You have got to stop lying. Bro, I got some for you and Adolf too. I don't give a fuck. I have clothes. I give a fuck that you're lying. That's why Adolf is so fucking mad at you. Look, I have an opportunity with these guys, and I can't fuck that up, all right? I'm trying to focus and make this shit happen. I don't know. I don't need to be there all the time. Is Adolf not wearing his Converse? Nah, Mike... you gotta stop. I hope this is all right. I didn't want to wake 'em up in the main house. Can I make a confession? Yeah. What? I really like you. Why are you laughing? I'll be right back. See you guys in two seconds. Thank you so much for letting me spend the night. I told Rachel it was really inappropriate. It's totally okay. It's all right. I know you're old middle school friends. It's a really nice house. Yeah. It's pretty great, right? Yeah. Love to have something like this one day. Oh, yeah? You can. Just gotta work hard. Look at Rachel. Right? Stanford. Come on. She's on the path. It's happening. It's gonna happen. How's the skateboard going? Going good. - Yeah. - Yeah? Just... keeping at it. Doesn't sound like much of a plan, but... I guess you know what you're doing. What's up, man, you good? - Yo, Michael, wassup, fool? - Wassup, man? Yo, what's wrong with you, man? Why you standing over here, bro? Come to the spot. It's a fuckin' party, bro. Relax. Come on now, y'all. Y'all know y'all not supposed to be up in here. I can be in here. He's tweaking asthma. Fuck this, bro. Watch this shit, bro. Oh my God, bro. Get your bum ass up outta here, bro. Come, Walker. Walker! Come on, stop fucking with me, man. I'm not fucking playing with you, bruh. Heat's over here, man. Get yo bitch ass up outta here, bro. I don't need your bum ass chillin' my spot. Go on, playboy, go ahead. What? She's down, bro. Look. I'm good, bro. Bro, I'm tellin' you, she give that sloppy top. Hey, it's cool. You got me all the way fucked up. - I'm fuckin' out. - She's down. I'm telling you. Where you going, bro? She's down! Quit being an asshole. Bro, I don't even fucking know you, man. What's up with you, man? You start acting all different around fuckin' Nolan and Isaiah. What's up with that? You come around me, you acting like a fuckin' weirdo, man. Come on, bro. I don't even know why I hang out with you, man. You're a fucking loser. Say that shit again. Back the fuck up. - Or what? - Back the fuck up, man. Motherfucker, what? Bro, back off! Godammit! Bitch ass motherfucker! What's up? Bitch! You think you fucking better than me? Bitch-ass motherfucker! You're not better than me, bitch! I'll let the boss know you're coming to work with me. I'm gonna skate. You're not skating. And you're not going to college. You're gonna come work with me. And I don't really care what you got to say about it. All right, Pops. I want you to cut off all the ends of all these two-by-fours. Okay. And I want you to take the wood and line it up against the fence. What fence? Well, you see this shiny little piece of metal right here with all the numbers on it? Okay, now take the wood and line it up so it's with the number four. - Okay. - And we call this the stop. Okay. Then you want to butt the stop up against the other side, so every piece that you saw, you want to make sure it's wedged between the butt and the fence, you got it? - All right. - You won't be laughing... when you cut off a finger. I'm not gonna cut off a finger. You're gonna cut off a finger if you don't know where the fence is, is the fence out here? Where's the fence? The fence is right here, I got it. How long ago did you learn that? Hey, look at me. Why are we fighting? I want to make sure you don't lose a finger. - What is this? - Stop. - Okay. - This. Hey, Madonna. Learn how to saw? Okay. Get your work done. Come here, talk to me guys. I just want to ask you a question here. Yeah? You think I brought my son to work so you could run your mouth on him? I was just making a joke. Yeah. Well, let's stop with the jokes. A fucking joke, man. Come on. Want me to spell it out for you? I'll snap your fucking neck, you run your mouth again. You understand me? - Ow... - You understand me? - Yeah. Got it. - Then get your fucking head right. Yo, Pop... Is it four or five? - I can't remember. - All right, got it. Pops? - Is it four or five? - Sit your fucking ass down. I thought you knew it all. Your hair wasn't doing you any favors before, you know that son, right? What are you talking about? Well you go out for a job interview or try and do anything respectable, people would look at you like you're crazy. Yeah, now people are gonna think I look like a skinhead. Well, that hair's gonna grow back and be the perfect length. You'll be all right. Yo... hey, yo, yo. Yo, what's up? - Do we know each other? - It's Michael. - I just cut my hair. - Oh, whoa. I didn't even recognize you, man. What's up? Everything good? Yeah. It's fine. We heard about you and Walker, man. I don't know why the fuck you hang out with that dude. I mean, he's our bro. We've known him forever. Yeah, but he's on some weird shit. So you just came here to talk shit on Walker. I came here to tell you guys that I'm... I'm serious about skating, all right? I want to go on trips with you guys. I want to get photos, film, all that... Look... you're a great skater and all, we fuck with you. We love what you do. You're a cool kid, but we can't have you out here doing cornball shit. You gotta realize, you getting into altercations and shit, that's fucking us up. That's making us look bad. We vouching for you. We trying to help you. You get me? So like... come on. Get it together, bro. - It's... - Real shit. That's my bad. Something I'm working on. Seriously. We good? You guys wanna skate? - Yeah... - Let's go. All right. Got your Sperry's on? You ready for college? Yeah. Well, my mom got me these for college. So... It's open. - What's up, bro? - What's up, brother? - 'Sup? - Thanks for coming. I'm tired, man. I've been working all day. What do you want? Just wanted to check in. You know, I feel like we haven't been on the same page lately. I just want to see how you were doing. Man, you really don't think you owe me and Jay an apology? Wait, for what? You just really don't get it. What do I owe you an apology for? For how the fuck you been acting. Sorry, bro. I guess. Fuck you. Fuck you. Hey, don't fucking say that. Don't say that. You're making it worse. Fucking idiot. - Adolf! Adolf! - No, fuck that. No, Adolf! You know what? Michael, since third grade, me and you had a dream... of us becoming pro together. That's all I want, is us to be together. What's wrong with that? Bro, that can't happen. Like what do you want me to do? Bring you out so you can just sit around and fucking make excuses all day? Why are you chuckling at that? It's not funny. Bro, you fucking see it. He's always at the park. Oh, my board's fucked up. Always something. There's always a fucking excuse. Huh? You're always injured. Huh? And I get a girlfriend. I don't see you with any girls. Just admit, man. You're fucking jealous of me. I'm not fucking jealous of you. What the fuck do you mean, "jealous?" Why would I be jealous of you? You're my fucking friend. The second you start hanging out with fucking Rachel, you ditch me! The second you start hanging out with Isaiah, and the fucking pros, you dicked me! Name one fucking time in my life have I ever ditched you? Tell me, I'll wait. You can't, huh? Exactly. Fuck you. Sorry, Mike. That's fine. I'll hit you up when I get settled into college. Hey, it's Michael, can I come in? You know, Stanford's only a few hours away. I'll see you on holidays. Damn early to fuck this up, Yeah. Thought we were gonna get married. Get a big house. White picket fence. Maybe a dog. Are you down to come to Stanford? I can put my application in. You know, even though we had our moments... I like you, and that's not gonna change. I know. I like you too. As a friend, though, right? Yeah. Well... yeah... Brought your... brought your stones over here. Didn't know if you wanted them back. Just keep 'em. Adolf! Adolf! We gotta talk, man. I'll be at the tent stair. Please come. Please. Wow! I'm right here. Got that right here. - Oh, that's sick man. - That's good. - Don't trip, man. - I gotta do that again. Nah, nah, nah. That's the one. Hey, you really killed it today, man. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. You too. Hey, so we're going up to San Francisco. We're gonna go shoot with Atiba... and we got an extra seat in the van, if you want to join us. Yes... Fuck, yeah, I'm super down. - Uh, can Adolf come? - Yeah, man. If y'all don't mind sharing a bed. See you. Don't get in shit. You did good today, man. - That stuff's gonna be sick. - Thank you. Thank you. I just want to tell you I'm sorry, bro. You know... I was so fucking fake. I never had a girlfriend before. I started skating with the pros. I didn't fucking know what to do. I didn't know how to handle that situation. Should've fucking brought you. Should have. Well... I'm really fucking sorry. I'm sorry too. For what? Ever since the third grade, me and you always just been neck and neck. You grow, I grow. I grow, you grow. But we always met in the middle. These past couple of months, you finally outgrew me. I just didn't know how to deal with it... but I just never wanted you to think that I ever was jealous of you. I'm not. You're my best fucking friend. I love you. You too, bro. Oh, fuck. I'm so happy we got to talk about that. You have no fucking idea. It's been in my head. This head's about to be fucking crazy, man. Pack your bag. Then get out real quick. Go home. I need to pack a bag too. I'm not coming to SF. Why? I work. Skating is your dream. Follow it. Kill it. I love you, bro. Love you too, bro. My man. You coming to help today? I came here to talk... as adults. Give me some space here. I just don't think that I can be the kid that you want me to be. And I understand your perspective, why you'd be scared that I'll just end up at the skate park. Well, you're not some kid from Toluca Lake. I can't offer you a safety net. I appreciate what you're saying. I really want to go for it. You go that route, and you can't live in my house any longer. You know that, right? I know. Pops, I really, I really do appreciate you. I don't want you to think I don't. My mom told me to be a postman. She said it had good benefits and a steady income. You keep talking about this postman thing. Your grandparents didn't have anything, and they worked really hard just so I could grow up and not have to be a criminal. You became a construction worker. You've lived in the same neighborhood your whole life. You haven't even been out of this country. There's an honor in being a normal person, son. Look, I didn't come here to argue with you. Okay? I appreciate you, but I'm gonna do me. Do you? I remember when you couldn't even wipe your ass. Hell, I taught you everything you know. I know and I love you. Okay? I'm not trying to attack you. Well, you are attacking me. Every day I told myself my son wasn't gonna be some random nobody, just another guy that didn't make it. But that is not the life that I want for you. You constantly have pain on your hands. You're a grown man recycling bottles. These hands made you. These hands gave life to you, son. No, Pops. My hands gave me a life. Your job was to take care of me. Okay? I didn't ask you to be put into this world. I had dreams too, but I dedicated my life to you. And I'm glad that I did. I just want you to support me. Son... I love you no matter what you do. Come on... You're my boy and I love you. And I am proud of you. You're a great man, and I love you. But good luck. As my wheels grip the concrete, as the sun touches my skin... I am alone... in the pursuit of the things I want, I lost the things I need. I am alone. Uh... yeah, boy!
