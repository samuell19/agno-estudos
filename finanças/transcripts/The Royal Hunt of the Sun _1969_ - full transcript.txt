(dramatic music) - [Francisco] Save you all. My name is Francisco Pizarro. I'm a bastard and a soldier of Spain. Once the world could have had me for a petty farm, two rocky fields and a Senor to my name. But the world said no. Said no and said no. Well now the world is going to remember me. (dramatic music) - It is quite plain your majesty that the petitioner Francisco Pizarro has suffered great hardships in his search for this kingdom of gold. It is also evident that he is a man of great endurance. On his first voyage he took with him 60 men and returned with 34. On his second voyage he took with him 80 men and returned with 12. All very admirable no doubt but how many such voyages can Spain afford? How much more Spanish blood must be wasted in this quest for a land that no one knows really exists? What books have you read that make mention of this kingdom of gold, name them. - Your majesty I cannot read or write. But I say it's there. - You petition from the Crown exclusive rights to explore and Governor as Viceroy all territory south of Mexico. An explorer is not simply a vagabond. An explorer makes discoveries. What in your time have you ever discovered? These golden trinkets but have been cast in Seville. These maps you have drawn can be bought by the dozen in any street bazaar. And this Indian savage. - Jesus Christ is my lord and savior. - Is already converted. (muted laughter) You have been a good soldier. The Crown remembers its faithful. Why not forget these grandiose schemes and return to Trujillo where you can live in comfort? You will be granted a modest pension. - All my life fighting for Spain and the cross is this how it ends? - There are other petitioners awaiting an audience Your Majesty. - Your Majesty your Vedor questions why so many men died on my past voyages and yet I always survived well that's no accident. Not in a land where by day the sun boils the marrow in your bones and by night freezes the water in your kidneys. When the food runs out you've had alligators for crawfish, jaguars for the price of snakes. At nights vampire bats can suck out your lifeblood. But Your Majesty beyond these gates of Hell lies the kingdom of gold, of gold Your Majesty. Who would you trust to make a journey through Hell? A scholar, a saint, or a soldier who has fought with death from Africa to the Indies? - Your capacity for survival is not in question. But you are a dreamer. If you would accomplish something my loyal subject you must be something. - Your Majesty your court is filled with cold precise perfect men, they're all something. But they dare not dream for fear of making a mistake so they do nothing. Your Majesty is how long can Spain endure doing nothing? - Make note the petitioner Francisco Pizarro is granted providing he finds his own means to finance this expedition. The Crown will retain one fifth of all he discovers but will give him no ships, no men, no money. Amendment, Crown does grant the services of two priests to bring the mercy of Jesus Christ and the words of his holy gospel to all creatures whom the petitioner encounters. (dramatic music) - General! General! General? I would like to be your page sir. I know Latin sir, 300 words. And I can write 600 words in Spanish. - A soldier doesn't need any of that boy. - Well I can keep your charts for you sir. - What's your name boy? - Martin sir. (church bell ringing) (men chanting) (dramatic music) - You are the huntsman of God. The weapons you draw are sacred. Oh God show us our way to beat the savage out of these dark forests onto the broad plain of thy grace. - You will bring to all tribes the nourishment of pity... - [Francisco] Took me a year to raise this Army. Gentlemen, cutthroats, mercenaries, and priests. - Don't think we go merely to destroy-- - [Francisco] And for all my promises my promises of gold, couldn't have done it without the Cavalier, my friend the Cavalier do Soto. - He who helps me lift this dark man into light I absolve of all crime he ever committed. Go then and be blessed. (speaking in foreign language) - You had word of my coming. You should not have allowed anyone to be blessed before me. - Your pardon Vedor. I do not understand matters of before and after. - That is evident. General on this expedition my name is the law. It is spoken with the kings authority. - Your pardon Vedor on this expedition my name is the law. They'll be no other. - [Vedor] In matters military. - [Francisco] In all matters. - Pizarro in the name of Spain our holy country I appoint you a second in command to me subject only to me, adelante. - Yes General. - You will do well not to incur my disfavor. In the eyes of the Crown you are still an adventurer. - Take up your banners. (trumpet music) March! (trumpet music) (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) - Hey you brownie. - Gently, you'll get nothing from him in terror. - Well let's see? - [Hernando] Put up your knife. Talk to him. - We want gold. (speaking in foreign language) - He has no gold all was taken by the great king in his war. - What king? (speaking in foreign language) - Holy Atahuallpa Inca over Earth and sky his kingdom is. - Who's this king, who did he fight? (speaking in foreign language) - Holy Atahuallpa. His father the great Inca Wyna grew two sons Vasca buy a wife, Atahuallpa by not wife. At his death he cut the kingdom in two for them but Atahuallpa wanted all. So he made war and captured his brother. Now he is Lord of Earth and Sky. - And he is the bastard? Answer. Atahuallpa is the bastard? (speaking in foreign language) - He is the son of the sun. He needs no wedded mother. He is god. - God? - God. - Oh my brothers where have we come? This is the land of Antichrist. We must, the cross will save you, stay him. Repeat Jesus Christ Inca. - Jesus Christ Inca. - Jesus the Christ Inca. - He's a god alright, they're scared to hell of him. And a bastard too. That's civil war, bastards against bastards. - We have a surprise for him. - You hear that Inca god? You're not gonna like that because we've got a God worth 1000 of yours, a gentle God with gentle priests, and a couple of great big canons to blow you out of the sky. (laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (calm music) - Listen to them. There's the world. Eagle rips the condor, that condor rips the crow. Crow would blind all the eagles in the sky at once if he had the beak to do it. (bird cawing) (groaning in pain) A wound from long ago. A knife to the bone a savage put it in to me for life. It troubles me at times boy. You'll stop before me with your wounds and your killing too. I wonder how you'll like that. - You watch me sir. - I will. It's a soldiers job to deal in death. All your study will be how to kill them, what scratches kill and what to cut. - But surely sir there's more to soldiering than that. - You mean honor, glory, tradition to the service? - Yes sir. - Listen boy know something. Men cannot just stand as men in this world it's too big for them they grow scared. They build themselves shelters called army, church, court. They're not real boy they're not true Martin. Do you see that? - No sir not truthfully sir. - No sir? Not truthfully sir? Why must you be so young? Army loyalty is blasphemy. The world of soldiers is a yard of ungrowable children. They wear ribbons. They make up ceremonies just to keep up the rest of the world. They count up the number of the blue dead and the green dead and they call that the history. Boy. That's just the flower the bandit carves on his knife before he plunges it into your side. Martin I've had a life of it. I tell you. It's nothing but a game played by brutes to give themselves a reason. (bird caws) Help me up will you? - [Martin] Is it better sir? - It's gone now, it's gone. (coyote barking) (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) - I speak for Atahuallpa Inca, Lord of the four quarters, King of the Earth and sky. - I will speak with him. A king's man must always greet a king's man. We bring greetings from King Carlos Emperor of Spain and Austria. We bring blessings from Jesus Christ son of God. - We are sent from the son of god. He orders you to visit him. - Where is your king? - He rests. A great army rests with him. It is not wise to raise his anger. - I said I came to give him blessing. How can that raise his anger? - Why will you bless him? - He is a god, I am a god. - General. - Be silent Father. Where is your king? (speaking in foreign language) - Behind the great mountains. - Must we march before we find him? - One life of Mother Moon. - A month, for us two weeks. (dramatic music) - The way is clear. Let's have church on the last day. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - On your feet soldiers. Boy play your drum. The church will precede us. Father. (drum beating) (suspenseful music) - Here you. One shiver dooms the lot of us. One yelp of fright you'll never be heard of again. We'll serve you like cattle pressed with a knife. Come on you cattle crash. (indistinct dialogue) (horse neighs loudly) (suspenseful music) (calm music) - Give the order General. - I know his orders, adelante. - We came for gold Vedor. I promised you this kingdom. Here it is. Didn't promise you life or everlasting happiness. So adelante. (calm music) - I bring greeting from Atahuallpa Inca, Lord of the Four Quarters. - King of the Earth and sky. Atahuallpa god makes this space empty for reason his people do not like strangers. You must not go from here. Outside it is great anger. This day and night god fasts. Tomorrow he will come with his soldiers here to look on you. - [Francisco] How many soldiers will he bring? - It is not for you to question. - My captain would like to know so that he may prepare his welcome. - Your captain gave word he is a god. A god has no fear. - The army's encamped about two miles away. - There's nothing between the town and their camp. Let's pay our respects. - No we wait here inside these walls. - No it's a trick a brownie trick. He's got us all marked for death. - It's the divine hand of providence Vedor. - In what way General explain yourself. - One entrance, one exit perfect ambush. - It's madness. - We're not fighting 10,000, one man. Get him the rest collapse. - Even if we can they will kill every one of us to get him back. - With a knife at his throat? What do worshipers do when you snatch their god? - Pray to you instead. - Then pray all. Disperse, confess them father's, battle orders first light. - Brace up boy. It's what you came for isn't it? Death and glory. - Yes sir. - The devil is strong in me. I believe nothing or I believe too much. - I have denied God and placed my faith in my king. Oh Lord give me the courage to reconcile the two. - If I should die tomorrow then let it be remembered that I seek nothing for myself. I want nothing for myself. If I must take the life of others then let that spring from the corruption of my flesh. But oh God keep my soul pure. (calm music) - General. When we met the Inca priests on the mountains you told them you were a god. Why did you say that? - I sent him news to amaze him. - I cannot condone blasphemy. - To conquer for Christ one can surely usurp his name for a night Father. - No not even for that. - Then I will recant at my next confession. - I'll remind you. - Where does the sun rest at night? - Nowhere it's a heavenly body set by god to move around the world in perpetual motion. - Do you know this? - All of Europe knows it. - What if they were wrong? What if it settled here each evening in these great mountains? A god laid down to sleep. - To a savage it must make a fine god. How fantastic that anyone on Earth should dare to say it's my father up there. My father the sun. (calm music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - They're coming! They're coming. They're coming. They're coming sir. - Out of sight boy. - Until the fighting sir? - No all the time for you. - Oh no sir. - Do as he says. (calm music) (grandiose music) (speaking in foreign language) - Where is the god? - I am a priest of God. (speaking in foreign language) - He doesn't want the priest he wants the god. - Our God cannot be seen. (speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] I may see him. - No he was killed by man and went into the sky. I am the answer to all mysteries. Hark pagan while I expand. First God created heaven and Earth which the better punished with eternal suffering. And the good rewarded with life hereafter. And this God created man from dust and gave him a spiritual life which we called the soul. No man is free from sin except our savior Jesus Christ. He was killed and crucified on a wooden cross like the one you see here. Now Jesus Christ by his own virtue rose from the dead and 40 days later ascended into Heaven where he sits at the right hand of the Father. He wished that his apostle Saint Peter be the prince of all is apostles and the successor as well as all other Christians. And that the Roman pontiffs as we Christians call the Pope's have the same power given to Saint Peter by God. The Roman pontiff who now lives on Earth understands that the people and nations of this kingdom ignore our creator their true God and blindly worship idols and images in the shape of demons. Therefore he has commanded our King Carlos V to bring all men to belief in the true God. In Christ's name I charge you declare yourself his willing vessel. (speaking in foreign language) - By what power do you speak? - By this the word of God. - God. God. - God? (yells in foreign language) (dramatic music) Francisco Pizzaro! - Why do you stay your hand when Christ is insulted? Let this Satan feel the power of your arm. I absolve you all, Santiago. (dramatic music) (cannons and guns firing) (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) - Enough, enough. Enough, enough, enough. (singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) - I am Francisco Pizarro General of Spain. It's my honor to speak to you. Would you not speak to me? - I am Atahuallpa Kabak, son of the sun, Son of the moon, Lord of the four quarters. Why you not kneel? - Milord I kneel only to my king. - Why you come here? - For God and King. Spain has many things your country doesn't possess. - You wanted gold that's why you came here. - You have gold? - It is the sweat of the sun. It belongs to me. - How much gold do you have? - Make me free. I will fill this room. - [Hernando] It's not possible. (babbling) - How long? - Two strikes of my Mother Moon. (speaking in foreign language) - [Francisco] No, you say no, why not? - You must swear to free me and you have no swear to give. - You're wrong my Lord. - No it's in your face. No swear. - I never broke my word. I never promised you safety. If I had you'd have it. - Francisco. Refuse sir, you could never free him. - It'll never come to that. - It could. - Never do you realize how much gold that would take? Even half would drown us in riches. - So at your age gold is no lodestone? - I promised my men gold yes? He stands between them and that gold. If I don't make this bargain he'll die. The men will demand it. - And what's it to you if he does die? - I want him alive. There's a meaning for meeting this man god. - General be careful. I don't understand you in full but I do know this. What you do now cannot be undone. - Words my Cavalier, words that don't touch me. This way the men will have their gold and I'll have him safe that's enough for the present. Now my Lord let us know what we say. You must strive to keep the peace. You must not escape. You must not urge your men to help you. So swear. (speaking in foreign language) - I swear. - Then I swear too. You fill this room with gold I set you free. (speaking in foreign language) - I think this man performs what he swears. Pray God we don't pay bitterly for it. (speaking in foreign language) (inspirational music) - But this is the truth my Lord. This land belongs to Spain. Well a few years ago a great call arose between the king of Spain and the king of Portugal. Well Spain claimed this land because of Christopher Columbus Portugal because of Vasco da Gama. His Holiness the Pope acted as judge and he gave this land to Spain. - Who? - Pope. - He's mad. He gives away country are not his. - [Francisco] I find you wanting in honesty my Lord. A month is past your rooms not quarter full. - [Atahuallpa] My kingdom is great. Porters are slow. You will see more gold before long. - The rumor is I shall see a rising before long. - If you not trust me send to Cusco. See how quiet my people sit. - You leave immediately with 20 men. - I will General. - God is tied by his word like you. But if he raised one nigh of one finger of one hand you would all die. - If you declare us false both these will die before us. - They are my priests, these can die. - Mother of God there's no confession possible for this man. - You cannot say that for certain Father. - Satan has many forms and there sits one. Tell me I'm only a simple priest. As an undoubted god you'll live forever here on Earth. - Here on Earth where god's come one after another young and young again to protect the people of the sun. Then they go up to his great place in the sky at his will. - What if they are killed in battle? - If it is not the sun's time for them to go. He will bring them back to life again at the next day's light. - How comforting and has any Inca so returned? - [Priest] No. - Curious. - This means only that all gods have died in the sun's time. - [Estete] Clever. - No true. - Tell me how can the sun have a child? - How could your God have a child since you say he has no body? - He is a spirit inside us. - Your God is inside you how can this be? - Well they eat him. First he become biscuit and then they eat him. - We have seen this at praying you say this is the body of our God. - And then they drink his blood, is very bad. Here in my empire we not eat man. - You are being deliberately stupid. Beware Pizarro give him the slack he will destroy us all. - Father has great zeal. - Yeah great zeal to see the devil in the poor dark man. - Not so poor General. The man who is the soul of his kingdom. Look hard you'll find Satan here. Because here's a country which denies the right to hunger. - You call hunger a right. - Course, gives life meaning. Look around you. Happiness has no feel for men here since they are forbidden unhappiness. They have everything in common so there's nothing to give each other, a pass of the seasons no more. As indistinguishable as mules, as predictable as trees. All men are born unequal and want is their birthright. Atahuallpa I will not rest until I have brought you to the true God. - No it's not the truth. Where is he? (operatic singing) Where is my father sun? You see now only by his wish. (operatic singing) Looking to him. He will darken your eyes forever. Do not speak to me again of your God. He is nowhere. - Milord you shouldn't anger our holy men. You promised me you wouldn't. - They are fools. - No they're not fools. - You believe with them? Look into me. You do not believe with them. - You shouldn't say that to me. - You do not believe with them. Their God is not in your face. (singing in foreign language) How was the song for you? - Robber birds? - Yes. - You're a robber bird yourself. - Yes, no... Explain. - You killed your brother to get the throne. - He was a fool. Atahuallpa was a man Vasca was a child. - He was the rightful king. - I was the rightful god. My sky father shouted raise up. Your brother is fixed only to tend herds. You were born to tend my people. So I killed him and land smile. - That was my work long ago, tending herds. - Was not your work, you are warrior. It's in your face. - You see much in my face. - I see my father. - You do me great honor. - No speak the truth. If in your home your brother was king and only fit for herds you would attack his crown. - [Francisco] If I could. - And then you would kill him. - Let me put to you another case. I come to a country I seize the crown but for fear of an uprising I cannot keep the crown unless I kill the king. What do I do? It's only a game we play milord only a game. Did you hate your brother? - He was ugly. Putayama was his mother. My mother was beautiful. - I didn't know my mother. She wasn't married to my father. - You are not then... - Legitimate? No milord no more than you. - So. - So. - To be born so is the sign of a great man. (laughing) - I think it is. (calm music) - Only most important man wearing this. You must kneel to me. - I've never been so distinguished to myself. (babbling) (grunting) - Now you dance. (laughing) - Over there. (calm music) - Welcome back sir. - Cavalier, Vedor, Candia I'm glad to see you. - [Cavalier] What's it like is there trouble? - Very quiet and terrible. They're just standing in the fields for hundreds of miles waiting their god to come back. - If he does they'll become fighters again. Then it's us for the line pit. - How is the General? - An altered man. No one's ever seen him so easy. He spends hours each day with the Inca. It seems they have more in common than their lowly birth. - The General's going to find it difficult when he has to do it. - Do what? - When he has to kill him. - He can't do that not after a contract witnessed before the whole army. - You call this rabble an army? Most of them volunteered simply to be absolved of their previous crimes. - The General made his pact with the Inca. - Well we can't let him go that's for certain. - He gave his word. - Yes Cavalier when a Christian swears with a Christian-- - Christianity isn't the issue, it's trust. - What's Cusco like? - Nothing but women, children, and old men. - The gold room is full. - The gold room is full! The gold room is full! (all shouting at once) - Where do you think you're going? You know the orders. Nothing till share out. Penalty for breech death, now disperse. - Get back to your stations. Keep a sharp lookout the danger isn't over yet. - I'd say it had only just begun. - General how's your journey? - The country's as quiet as a grave. Cusco is like a dead city. The gold room is full. - [Francisco] I know it. - You must make the share out now. - Have Diego melt everything down. - But there are objects of great beauty. - What a tender man you are. Boy your pen. Milord you are now going to learn a Spaniards honor. Take this down boy. Let this be known throughout my army the Inca Atahuallpa having discharged his obligation to General Pizarro is today a free man. (dramatic music) - Milord your freedom. (dramatic music) - What is that you have done? - This is writing milord. - Explain. - These are signs. This is Atahuallpa, this is free. - You put this is sign and he will see and know free? - Yes milord. - No. - Yes milord I'll do it again. - Here on my hand. - What's the one you put? - God. - What is put? - God. - God? Show me again more signs. - What is put? - What? - Put put. - It's only a game. - The General never learned the skill my Lord. A soldier does not need it. - A king needs it. There is great power in these marks. You are king in this room. You must teach us too. We will learn together like brothers. - You'd stay with me here to learn. - No tomorrow I wish go. - And then? What then? - I will not hurt you. - [Francisco] Nor my army? - That I not swear. - You must. - Do not say this thing now. - No I do say it. Before I let you go Atahuallpa you must swear you will not hurt a man in all my army. - I not swear this. - For my sake. - 2000 of my servants were killed, 2000 without arms. - There's a way of mercy. - It is not my way it's not your way. - Swear it to me then. - Keep your swear first. - Cannot. - Cannot? - Not immediately you must see you are many we are few. - Is not important. - It is to me. - You gave your word. - And we'll keep it only not now, not today. - When? - Soon. - When? - Very soon. - When? (both shouting at once) (shouting in foreign language) - I will kill every man. - Will you? Boy what did I put? - This is today a free man. - Continue. But for the welfare of the country he will remain for the moment as guest of the army. - Ever seen so much gold Father? (dramatic music) - Soldiers of Spain you have fought and won the good fight of the cross. We have overcome a deceitful king. To make amends this treacherous monarch has delivered to us reparations which we will now share out. (men cheering) - Keep in line lads you'll all get yours. There's enough for everyone. Now these are the orders. That each man take his share to his quarters and carve his mark. - How is the General? - In a bad temper. His old wound is acting up again. - Well I'm sorry to hear that he's still subject to distresses. I had hoped that victory would have brought him a calmer spirit. - Must be his new wealth Vedor. So much so sudden must be a great burden for him. - The burdens of the General sir are care for his men and for our present situation. Let us try to lighten them for him as we can. - Vedor. - Let us indeed. One throat cut and were all lightened. - It would greatly relieve the Crown if you would cut it. - If I? Oh you mean I'm not Spanish so don't have to trouble with honor. - You're not a subject. It could be disowned by my king and you have none. - So Palace of Disinterest has a crap house after all. Look man you're the overseer so do your job. Go to the General tell him the brownie must go. - General mutiny's smoking. Act now or it'll be a blaze you'll not put out. - What do I do? - Take our chances what else can we do? You have to let him go. - What happens then? Tiny army's wiped out in five minutes. The whole story's forgotten for always. Later on somebody else will conquer Peru and no one will ever even remember my name. - What kind of name will they remember if you kill him? - A conqueror is that at least. - A man who butchered his prisoner after giving his word. There's a name for your ballads. - I won't be around to hear them. What do I care? What does it matter? Whatever I do what does it matter? - Nothing if you don't feel it. Look I wish you've never made this bargain but you made it. Now you've no choice left. - This is my kingdom. In Peru I'm an absolute I have the choice always. - No you did have it but you made it. - Then I take it back. - And that will be from your own fear. That's not choosing. - May the Crown be allowed a word? - I know you your word, death. - What else can it be? - Your army's in jeopardy you care nothing for them? - You here that Cavalier? Do you care nothing for them? - I care about them less than I care about you. God knows why. - The issue is simple. You are the Viceroy here ruling in the name of the king who sent you. You have no right to risk his lands for any reason at all. - What has this king ever done for me? Allowed me salary if I found money to pay it? Permitted me to fit out this expedition at my own expense? Allowed me governance if I found land to govern? Magnificent. - This is ridiculous. - For years I strove to make this expedition, years of scars and hunger. If I fail this time this king of yours would have cast me off with one shrug of his royal feathers. Now I cast him. Francisco Pizarro casts off Carlos V of Spain. Go and tell him. - You miserable creature. Where would you be without your king and country? - My country? What has my country ever done for me? The only place I know in it is that filthy village I was born in. For 22 years I drove pigs down those streets because my father couldn't own to my mother. 22 years without a single day of help. When I turned soldier and dragged my boots along the roads to Italy I was so famished I was beyond eating. I got nothing from my country. Though I groaned for that once I'm glad of it now. Because I owe my country nothing. Tell you real. You'll have to furnish me with better argument before I give up Atahuallpa. - For verse man what is Atahuallpa to you? - Someone I promised life. - Promised life how quaint. The sort of chivalrous idea that you pretend to despise. If you want to be an absolute king my man you have to learn how to act out of self will. Break your word just because you made it. Till then you're nothing but a pig man trying to copy his betters. - Sir listen to me. No promise to a pagan need bind a Christian. Simply think what's at stake, the lives of 167 of the faithful. Are you willing to sacrifice them for one savage? - [Francisco] You know lives have no weight. 10 cannot be added up to 1000. - One, can good count against one evil? And this man is evil. His people kiss his hands as a source of light. - As we do yours. All day you play at being God. You only hate my Inca because he does it better. I despise you. Kill who I bid you kill and I will pardon it. You with your milky fingers forcing them the blade. How dare you priests bless a man going into battle. Rip you scream, tear blind in the name of Christ. Tell me soft Father. If Christ were here would he kill the Inca? And you brother De Nizza, lord of all the answers. Would you have me kill him? - Don't try and trap me. I know as well as you how terrible it is to kill. But worse it is to spare evil. When I came here first I thought I'd found paradise. Now I know it's hell. There's a sinful core of the soul. For the sake of the free spirit in each of us it must be destroyed. - There's no Christian charity? To save my own soul I'll kill another man. - To save love in the world you must kill lovelessness. - Hail to you father sole judge of love. No salvation outside your church. No love it in either. Father. I do not know love. But if I have none for Atahuallpa what can I ever know of it? - [Soldier] Go on get him. (all shouting at once) - I didn't mean to kill him. We were playing dice I caught him cheating. I didn't mean to kill him. - Fighting's forbidden you know that. You know the penalty. Confess him Father. Atahuallpa. - General. General. General! Another fight broke out so there's one more dead. - Who? - Mendoza he drew a knife. I only meant to split his leg but he slipped and got it through the guts. - You do well to punish fighting. - Yes sir. May I speak free sir? Well to me you're the greatest General in the world and we're the greatest company. - So you want me to kill him is that it? - Well what other way is there? The men are out of their wits. There's death all around them. - Death is all around them. I promised you gold not life. I've kept my part of the bargain. - I'll give you death. When I get back to Spain a commission will hail you to the state for what you've said today. - If I free the Inca Father you'll never get back to Spain. - You mad man. Now see here you put him underground by sunset or I'll take the knife to him myself. - They ache for your death. Some of them will die before you. - Batalia. - What a touching scene, prisoners and jailers. But it's over now General. Do you think I'm gonna die so that you can dance with a darky. - Sorry sir but it's gotta be done. - There's nothing you can do about it General.
