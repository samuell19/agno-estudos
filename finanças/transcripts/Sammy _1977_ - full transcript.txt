(laughing) (crowd cheering) - [Umpire] Strike two. (crowd cheers) - Matt just hit another home room. Hey guys, listen. You don't think that's important, but it is important. If Matt wins, he'll be in a good mood, so he'll help us. See? - You won this one Redding, but we'll massacre you for the championship. - Right Sid. We'll be looking forward to it. (group laughs) - We'll set 'em a trap next time. - Come on you guys. - Aren't you coming to Robinson's for a victory malt? - Can't, gotta go get Sammy and get home. - Aw, let Sammy get his own self home for one night. - I gotta take care of him Dave. - Yeah but-- - Okay Matt. See ya tomorrow. - Goodbye. - He's always stuck with his brother. I mean always. - I wish you'd stick closer to the field Sammy. What have you got? - Kittens! - Kittens? Oh no. Mom is still mad at me for letting you take that squirrel home last week that ate her good winter coat. - Kittens don't eat coats. - They're not going to get the chance, 'cause they're not going home. - [Sammy] Please Matt? - No! Now where'd ya get 'em, 'cause they're gonna go right back. - Can't, the janitor found them in the furnace room and he's going to drown them. I saved them. - They've got to go back. - He'll kill them. - [Matt] Mom'll kill me! - I'll keep them in my room. - Swell, how are you gonna feed them? - I'll figure out summim'. Please Matt. - I don't wanna be a murderer, but Mom said-- - [Sammy] Mom'll love them, wait and see. (gentle music) - Thank you. - [Sammy] Pastor Clemmons! Boy am I glad to see you. - Hi Sammy, what ya got there? - A present for you. - For me? - Yeah, you live in a basement apartment, don't you? - Well yeah, but I-- - [Sammy] So you need a cat to catch mice. - I don't have any mice. - Now ya never will. - Yeah but Sammy I. Oh, you're not much bigger than a mouse yourself. - Hi Pastor Clemmons. - Hi Matt. - That's great that you needed a cat. You couldn't use two could you? - No. - Oh well, see ya. - Wanna go home? - Hi Mrs. Pierce. We have a really nice kitten who needs a home. One's the same color as your dog. They'd go real nice together. - No Sammy. - They're really nice kittens. - No Sammy, thanks anyway. - Sammy, Mr. Thomas is going to take one for his granddaughter. - Hooray! How am I gonna be a veterinarian if I don't learn how to take care of animals? - Veterinarians don't have all their animals in their bedrooms. - Oh what cute kittens. Are they yours? - No ma'am. We're trying to find homes for them. - Can't we have one, please Mom? - We'd better not. Of course a kitten is awfully clean. But not right now. No, I don't think so. - Sammy! We'll never get it past Mrs. Simmons. She's always near the door when someone comes in and she had a fit when you brought in the hamsters. - Think of something Matt. We've got to get Moses into the bedroom. - Moses? - Yeah, Moses. On account we found him past drift, you know, like Moses. - Oh brother. Sammy. (playful music) (cat screeches) - Oh, it's only you two boys. - Hi Mrs. Simmons. - Your mom and dad aren't home yet. - Oh good. - [Mrs. Simmons] Huh? - We have some chores to finish before Mom gets home. (Moses meows) - What was that? - Huh? - I thought I heard a cat. Didn't you boys hear a cat? - Uh. - I saw a big ole tom outside a minute ago Mrs. Simmons. He might be hanging around. - Well I'll just go get my broom and we'll see how long he hangs around. Here kitty, kitty, kitty. Where are you young? - That was too close. - Moses need some milk. - Mom and Dad'll be home in a few minutes. We've gotta set the table and get going. - As soon as I feed Moses. - [Mrs. Redding] Matt, Sammy, we're home. - Maybe we should wait until after supper when they're in a better mood. - Yeah. Sammy will you put my jacket in my room for me? I forgot to hang it up. - [Mrs. Redding] Hi guys, how was school today? - Fine Mom, fine. - [Sammy] Hey. - Hi Sammy. - Now Moses, you be quiet until I get a chance to introduce you to Mom and Dad. I'll introduce you to your other friends in here so you'll feel at home. This is Ice and Cream. This is Jerry and Mabel. This is Queenie. She used to have a king, but he died. This is Arthur, he's very friendly. I'll introduce ya to the rest later. I gotta go help with supper. - [Mrs. Redding] You wanna get the dishwater Sammy? - Yeah. - [Mrs. Redding] Alright. - Dad? - Yeah. - Could I ask you something? - Yeah sure son, what is it? - Well I was in the store today. Mr. Thomas' store, getting a loaf of bread. And Mr. Thomas said he was looking for a kid to run some errands every day after school and on Saturday. He'd pay me a dollar an hour just for running little things to people in the apartments around here. Old ladies who have a hard time walking. You know, stuff like that. - No Matt. - But I could earn that money for my new glove. My old glove is falling apart. - You've gotta take care of Sammy while we work. That's on Saturdays and after school. - It seems like Sammy is more important than anything. - What do you mean by that? - I mean that we can never do or buy anything because of Sammy's operations and everything. - That's enough son. - Please let me work for Mr. Thomas, Dad. - I said no, Matthew. Now that's the end of it. No. - [Mrs. Redding] Do you have to go out again tonight? - Yeah, I got a prospect tonight at 7:30. - Hmm, that's every night this week. - Well it takes a lotta money for operations and braces and everything. I'm sorry honey. Just had a talk with Matthew. He wants a new baseball glove. He even found a job to pay for it, but-- - Who'd take care of Sammy? - I know it's unfair to Matthew, but what in life is fair? It's Sammy who has the shortest end of the stick. - You know, Phil Clemmons called last night. He wanted to come over and see us. - Pastor Phil Clemmons? - He was your best friend. - Look, I gotta get going if I'm gonna make that appointment. - Don't you even wanna see him? - (sighs) No Marilyn, I don't. (gentle music) - Goodnight Matt. Ah, you're ready for bed for a change. That's nice, thank you. You're growing Sammy. It's gonna need a new brace soon. Okay. There we go. I forgot to ask you, how was school today? - [Sammy] Ah, fine Mom, fine. - [Mrs. Redding] Sammy. - Yes, Mom? - We always seem busy, your Dad and I, but if anything was bothering you, sometime, you would talk to us about it, wouldn't you? - Uh, sure Mom. - I mean. (yelps) What is that? Matthew. Mrs. Simmons doesn't even like hamsters, let alone cats. You know cats and dogs are against the rules here. - We tried to find him a home. - Well try harder, because I want that cat out by tonight. - It may take longer Dad. - No longer than two days. Find that kitten a home before Monday. - Yes sir. - [Mrs. Redding] And stay out of trouble. - Let's get going or we'll be late for work. - Goodbye boys. - Cats! - They made rakes better back in those days. How 'bout a dollar for the box? - Fine Mr. Frohm. Oh, do you happen to need a cat around here by any chance? - We have a really nice kitten who needs a home. - You know I got a million cats around here, all after the rats. - Did you find a car with a radio left in it yet? - Check with me next Saturday boys, something'll come in by that time. - Yeah, oh well. Thanks Mr. Frohm. - Matt, let's go to the park. - Aw Sammy. - Please Matt. I'm too slow to ever get a swing at school. Please. - Okay. - Hi boys! - Hi Pastor Clemmons. Have a piece of candy. - Oh, thanks Sammy. - Hi Pastor Clemmons. - Hi Matt. - How's your kitten? - Oh Mushroom is doing fine. - Mushroom? - I call her Mushroom because she eats so much. At the rate she's going, believe me, she'll look like a mushroom. Ah, it's nice up here. It's like being up in a tree. It's a good place to do some thinking. - Yeah. - You know when I was your age, I used to climb out on the roof to pray. I always thought that would make me closer to God, that way he could hear my prayers better. - You weren't a very smart kid. - (chuckles) Well maybe not. But the Lord loved me anyway. - I started to ask the Lord into my heart in Sunday School last Sunday. But Matt said I shouldn't. - Sammy! - Why Matt? - 'Cause my dad might not like it. Isn't that what you said Matt? - That's enough Sammy. - Matt, are you saying that your dad wouldn't want you and Sammy to accept God? - [Matt] Yeah. - You don't have to climb on things because the Lord is everywhere, right? - [Pastor Clemmons] Right. - Besides, I can't climb very well and the Lord is fair to everyone. - He sure is Sammy. - My dad doesn't believe in those things and he doesn't think we should either. - Tom Redding said that? - We've gotta go. - I believe in Jesus and I want to accept him as my Savior. Will you help me? - Let's go see your dad son. - He and mom work 'til late on Saturdays. But we are supposed to do what the Lord wants us to do. Even my dad? - Oh right Sammy, even your dad. - And I want to accept the Lord right now. I've already missed a whole week because I didn't last Sunday. Will you help me? - Of course I will Sammy. - I believe that Jesus died for my sins and that he rose from the dead. I'm really sorry for all my sins. Now I have to tell Mrs. Simmons that I lied about the cat in the front yard. And, oh I forgot. - You're doing fine. - But what do I do now? - Tell the Lord. - Yeah. Jesus, I'm really sorry for all my sins. I'll go back and make them up to all the people I've been wrong to. Jesus, I love you and I believe in you. Will you be my Savior? I did it! - Welcome to the family Sammy! - Sammy, what are you doing? - I just accepted the Lord into my heart! Come on, you can too. Pastor Clemmons will help you. - Come on Sammy we've gotta go. - Matt, what's the matter. - [Matt] Sammy. - It's so good to have the Lord in your heart. Why do we-- - Sammy, shut up. - Matt? - Don't you dare say a word to Dad. I mean it Sammy. I get bawled out enough on account of you. Keep your mouth shut. - Yes, Matt. Matt? - What? - Are you mad at me? - Oh Sammy. - [Mr. Frohm] Back up, back up. - [Matt] Whoa. - Scoot back here fellas. Well, that does it. I've gotta get a crusher over here. - Can we watch? - It'll be any day now. Keep an eye out. - [Matt] I will. - Well there's a catcher of blues and his little brother, Tiny Tim. (boys mockingly groan) Don't run away. You could play a game and use your little brother for a space. - I'd rather use your head Sid. Saw dust is softer to fall on. - Oh yeah? What are you looking at kid? - I'm worried about that Formicidae Hymenoptera on your shoulder there. You might kill it when you and Matt fight. - That what? - Formicidae Hymenoptera. It's right there, just below your neck. - Where. Help me Frank. Get it off me Frank. Help. Just don't stand there Frank. Just don't stand there, get it off me. Get it off Frank, help! - Sammy? - Yeah. - What kinda insect did Sid have on him? - Oh, just a little black ant. That was his book name: Formicidae Hymenoptera. (both laughing) I wouldn't lie. - Did you get those ears? - [Sammy] Yeah. - Both of 'em. - Aw Mom. - We're short again this month. We just never seem quite to be able to make it. (knocking at door) - Are you expecting a prospect? - No, maybe it's your mother. - No. - Oh, how ya doing? Phil, look I'm a little. Come in. - Hey Sammy, Matt. - Well. What brings you to our neck of the woods? - Didn't Sammy or Matt tell ya I was coming over? - No, I think they forgot to tell me about it. - Well, I thought you'd like to know that Sammy accepted the Lord today. - He what? - Phil, why don't you sit down. Would you like a cup of coffee? - Oh yes, thanks Marilyn. Sammy accepted the Lord as his Savior today. I was there. - I'll bet you were. - Tom. - We've been friends for a long time Tom. What's the matter? I never see you. I've tried. - I'm sorry Phil. Look, I've got an appointment. - Tom, please. - I'll go with you. What's wrong Tom? We've been friends since we were kids. Now you're brushing me off like an enemy. - You are an enemy Phil. You're hurting Sammy and Matt with all your fairy tales about a loving God. - Fairy tales? - I believed all that garbage just like you Phil. Then the real world kicked me right in the teeth. - What are you talking about? Nothing is more real than God's love. - Is it love that creates cripples? Is it love that uses a helpless child to cripple a family? Every time I look at Sammy I think of how stupid I was to believe. - But we must trust his love. Can't you understand? - It's you who don't understand Phil. You don't have a child who's a helpless cripple. - We are all cripples until we are made whole in Christ. - Sammy doesn't need your God as a crutch Phil. Now stay away from him! And Matthew too. - You're awful quiet Matt. You didn't even get mad at me for taking my caterpillar to Sunday School. - Yeah, well Dad'll be awake when we get home. I supposed I'm going to get it because of Pastor Clemmons coming last night. - [Sammy] Maybe he won't be mad Matt. - Yeah, maybe. Hey! - Oh, I'm sorry Matt. There's a spider in this hall around here some place. - Sammy! - Spiders are very friendly. They like people and they eat harmful insects. - [Matt] Mom'll just love your friendly spider. - [Mr. Redding] No, I let them go to Sunday School to be with kids their own age because they have so few chances the way we work all the time. - [Mrs. Redding] But Tom-- - I didn't realize they were taking it so seriously. Especially Sammy. - It's been good for both of them. - I won't have their heads filled with that stuff. They'll only be hurt when they grow up. - They'll be hurt if they grow up not knowing about the Lord. - [Mr. Redding] We've talked about this before. - [Mrs. Redding] No Tom, you've talked about it. You never considered my opinion. - [Mr. Redding] Marilyn! - I don't go to church because it upsets you. Well it's made me very unhappy. Now please don't do that to the boys. - Isn't it bad enough that Sammy's gonna be a helpless cripple all of his life? You wanna cripple his mind too? - [Mrs. Redding] Tom! - That's it. No more Sunday School for them. (tense music) How long you been home? - A while. - Why haven't you gotten rid of that cat? Now you were supposed to have that cat out of here by today. - Billie said he'd take Moses on Wednesday. - He's out by Wednesday or he goes to the pound. - Dad! - Hey Matt, did you forget our practice game tonight? - I can't, I have to take Sammy to the clinic. - But we only have one more day until the championship game. - How can we practice without our captain? - I can't help it Dave. I have to take Sammy for his therapy. - Can't you skip it just once? - No. We gotta go. - Maybe we need a captain who has more time for their team. - Easy Dave. Hey Matt, wait a minute. - I can't. - Who ever heard of a babysitter who's the captain of a team? - [Mike] He can't help it Dave. - But we have to win this game. - We need Matt to do it. He is our best hitter. - Then maybe we should start looking around for another great hitter. One who doesn't have a brother. - You wanna hold him? - Oh, could I? - Sure. - [Girl] What's his name? - [Sammy] Wilson K. I named him after a kid at school who sorta looks like him. - Samuel Redding. - That's me. You can keep him if you want. They're great pets. - Can I really? - [Sammy] Sure. - Oh thank you. - [Sammy] They don't like flies. - Did it hurt? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. - Mom always has chocolate cake on therapy nights, 'cause it's your favorite. - Yeah! (happy music) - Homemade bread, Mom's home! - She's cleaning. My room! - Your room is right. Got the day off and cleaning. I want you both to clean your rooms. Don't forget your socks under the bed. - I gotta get some lettuce for my hamsters first. - Alright. - Matt, you help me hang these clean drapes, okay? Stay away from that bread Samuel. (playful music) - Here you go Jerry. Hold it Mabel. Moses! Moses. Cream! Where's Ice? You didn't. Moses, you couldn't eat Ice. He's your brother. There he is. You'll suffocate. - Did you get all the socks? Oh my! What is going on young man? - One of my mice got loose. - Loose? Where? (glass shatters) - [Sammy] Arthur got out of his jar. - Arthur? - My snake. (Mrs. Redding screams) Mom, shut the door. (both exclaiming) - [Mrs. Redding] Come here kitty, kitty, kitty. Look out Sammy. Whoa! Stand up, there you go. (exclaiming) (screams) - Help! (screams) (sighs) (screams) - [Mrs. Redding] Down the hall. Sammy go on. (women yelping) - I caught Arthur. - A snake? (women sigh) (sad music) - No Matt, don't let Fred out near Lassie. He'll eat him. - Do you have to call a beetle Lassie? - I like dogs. - [Matt] A beetle is not a dog. - No, but I can't have a dog. So I name a beetle Lassie. - Good grief. - I'm really gonna miss Arthur. We're good friends. - [Pastor Clemmons] Hi boys. - Do you live in this park? - Well, almost. This is my thinking place. Hey, what's wrong Sammy? - We have to get rid of my animals. I love Arthur. - Looks like a very beautiful snake. - He's very affectionate. - Well if you love him, why do you keep him in a jar? - He's right Sammy. Can't be much fun for Arthur to be stuck in a jar all the time. - 'Cause um... - You see, when you love someone, you wanna do what's best for 'em, don't you? - I'm really gonna miss him. - Yeah, but you want Arthur to be happy. - I'm sorry Arthur. I didn't think about how you'd feel. Here. Goodbye Arthur. I hope you meet a lotta snakes and make good friends. - Can't he have any pets? - No. Tomorrow he has to get rid of a cat. The apartment lease says no pets. And that's it. - Well he can always visit Mushroom. - That'd only make him feel worse. - Yeah. I think we need some ice cream or something to cheer us up. - My mices' names were Ice and Cream. - Well I'll even go as far as a banana split. - Wow! - A banana split? - With nuts. - Come on Sammy, with nuts. - Double nuts? - Double nuts. - Hurry up Sammy. I can't be late for the game. Today's the championship. - I just wanted to say goodbye to Moses. - Say it on the way, come on! - Hi Billie, hi Mrs. Branson. I brought the kitten. - You can take that cat right back Sammy Redding. I won't have a cat in my house. - But Billie said he'd take the cat today. - Billie had to right to take an animal without asking. He knows I'm allergic to cats. - Oh no! - I knew Mom was allergic to cats. But I didn't think she'd mind a kitten. - Well I do mind. Sorry boys, but no cats. - You wanna play Sammy? - I can't today Billie, see ya. (sad music) (dog barks) - Where have you been? The game's almost over. We're in the 7th inning. - For crying out loud Matt. We're losing on account of you. - We up? - Yeah. Sid's pitching and he's killing us. (crowd yells) - [Umpire] Strike one. - [Matt] Don't let it bother you Bobby. You can hit it. - [Umpire] Strike two. Strike three. (crowd cheers) Strike one. - Hang in there. - It's okay. - You can do it Dave, come on. (crowd cheers) - Well the star finally showed up. Too bad it's too late. - Don't let it bother you Redding. Come on! - [Umpire] Strike one. (team cheers) Ball one. - Come on Sid, you trying to kill him? Come on Matt. Alright Matt, let's hit a home run. Come on. - [Umpire] Strike two. (crowd cheers) - Come on Matt. You can get a hit. (crowd cheers) Come on Matt, let's have a hit. (tense music) (crowd cheers) - [Umpire] Strike three. - [Man] Alright Matt, great game. Alright, good job. - Nice going. Greatest little strike out I ever did see. (team laughs) - [Guy] Alright. - Nice try Matt. - I'm sorry fellas. I had to do something with Sammy-- - You always have to do something with Sammy, Matt. - Wait a minute Dave. - You wait a minute. We depended on you. You let us down. Captains don't let their teams down. - [Matt] Dave! - Dave'll cool off and so will the others. Don't let it get ya. - Yeah. - Nobody likes to lose. You're still our best hitter, when you're here. - [Sammy] I'm sorry Matt. - Just shut up! You don't say one word, just shut up. (tense music) - It's hopeless. We gotta cut down somewhere. We'll just never catch up on these bills. - Well maybe I can ask for more overtime. - Yeah, then who'd be home with the boys? We gotta think of something. - [Mrs. Redding] Hi. - Wait a minute young man. You were supposed to get rid of that cat today. Well answer me. Why is he still here? - We couldn't get rid of him. - You played a game today? - Yeah. - Instead of doing what you were supposed to do? - Matt is something wrong? - I'm just tired of being a stupid babysitter all the time. - Matt! - It's not fair. Sammy brought that dumb cat, I didn't. Why do I have to be stuck with what he does all the time? - Matt, we'll talk about it later. - Yeah, when? You're always too tired and we never talk. - That's enough. Don't you ever talk to your mother that way again. - When am I ever supposed to talk? When are you ever gonna listen to me? I'm Matt, you know, your oldest son, the one that doesn't even exist in this family. - Cut it out Matt. Unless you wanna go to bed without supper, now. - Fine, I'm not hungry anyway. - They lost the game. - I never woulda guessed it. - I think I'd better go talk to him. - No! He can stew in his own juice a while. He's got to learn to accept his responsibilities whether he likes them or not. - We tried to give away Moses but nobody wanted him. - Well the pound'll take him. - Dad! - No Sammy. I told you what the alternatives were. Now I'll take him there on Saturday after work. (sad music) Go wash your hands for supper. - I brought you some supper in case you might get hungry. - You should've been the one to go without supper. It's always my fault. Always. There's no money in this family because of all your doctor bills. There's no way I can even work and earn money because I have to babysit you. I have no fun because of you. And now I lost the game because of you. And I get punished because of your cat! Why am I stuck with you all the time? Why were you ever born? All you do is cause the rest of us trouble. I can't stand the sight of you. Go away! Get out! Stay away from me! It's all your fault! Its always your fault. - You might get hungry later. (sobbing) It's awful quiet in here with nobody here but us. I cause a lot of trouble for everybody. It's not your fault. Tomorrow I'm gonna find you a home. I didn't want to before. I kept thinking that I could keep you. But I couldn't. I'm sorry Jesus. I know I wasn't supposed to keep him. I was wrong. I made things wrong for everybody. Help me to find a home for Moses. Could you have a radio come in in the junkyard tomorrow? That would make Matt feel better. I'll get up early and go get it and surprise him. I know you can do anything. And if you'd just take the time to see to the radio I'd really appreciate it. I love you Jesus. (peaceful, thoughtful music) - I'm not gonna be put off another week. Yes, I'll wait while you check. But make a fast check young man. - Mr. Frohm has the radio come in? - Yeah boy, it's over there. The Maroon station wagon. Ah, there you are. No, not Monday, tomorrow. Alright, tomorrow it is. But you have that crusher over here early tomorrow or I'll sue. Now I mean it. I'll sue. - It's alright, just pretend we're mountain climbing. Well, pretend we're hunting a big piece of liver. I thought you'd like that better. (Mrs. Redding talking in hushed tones) - [Matt] I don't know, he wouldn't have gone to school this early. - Where would he have gone? - Maybe he went to Billie's about the cat again. - [Mr. Redding] That cat has caused more trouble. - Hello, Mr. Branson? Yeah, I'm sorry to call you so early. Is Sammy there? No? Oh. I'm sorry if I woke you up. Goodbye. - I'll go look in the park. - Check the grocery story. He's probably begging food for that cat. - He didn't even sleep inside his bed covers last night. I didn't check because we were talking. - He's around the neighborhood honey. Sammy wouldn't... I'll get in the car. I'll drive around. He's somewhere trying to find a home for that cat. - I never thought of how I'd get it out once I got one. Man. Oh boy. Moses. (tense music) Where are you? Moses! Oh no. I can't get this thing open. I'm trying. - No, no thank you Mr. Harrison. We, we just thought maybe he'd gone over to his mice. No, that's alright. Thank you. Goodbye. - Covered the entire neighborhood. There's no sign of him. Honey, I think we'd better call the police. - Help! Mr. Frohm! Help! Help! It must be lunchtime because I'm very hungry. You didn't have breakfast either. Help! Help! Help! - Did you find him? - No, Mrs. Simmons. - Do you think he ran away? - We don't know Mrs. Simmons. - Well, when you do find him-- - What? - Tell him he can keep the mice. If he keeps it in a cage. And the hamsters too. But not the snake. - Yeah, thank you Mrs. Simmons. - Mrs. Redding we're doing everything we can. (knocking at door) - I, I thought it over again Mr. Redding. You tell Sammy that he can have the snake as long as he keeps it in a jar. But not the cat! Oh. (frenzied music) - [Sid] Why don't you look where you're going. - I'm sorry Sid. I didn't see you. - [Sid] Yeah, I bet. - I was thinking of something else. - You broke my bag! - Look Sid, I'll fight you any other time you want. But I can't now because I'm looking for my brother. - What's new about that? - I mean it. He's disappeared and even the police are looking for him. - Yeah? - I gotta go. Sorry about the apples. I'll make it up later, okay? - No, it's not okay. Hey Matt! Uh, oh. - (laughing) Cut it out Mushroom. Go drink your milk. (knocking at door) Ah Matt, hi! What's the trouble Matt? Please, come on in. - [Matt] Is Sammy here? - Well no, he hasn't been here? Was he coming over? - I hoped he was. I thought he mighta come here because, because... - Why? - We think that Sammy has run away. - Sammy? Ooo, that's hard to believe Matt. - He's been gone since, we don't even know. When we got up this morning he was gone. We called and looked everywhere. And I thought of you, so I came over. - I see. Why would he want to run away? - Because I jumped on him. I told him that all the problems in the family were his fault. And that I never wanted to see him again, or something like that. - Well I know that Sammy loves and admires you Matt. - It's all my fault. He was so happy because you helped him receive the Lord. And I jumped on him for that too. - Why? - Because I thought my dad would blame me for it. - You know Matt, it was your Dad who encouraged me to accept Jesus as my Savior. - My dad? - Yes, he was pretty close to Jesus when he was your age. - He isn't now. - Well he may not think so, but Jesus never leaves you. Once you accept him as your Savior. He's always right there whenever you need him. - Boy do I need him. - Well then why don't you ask for his help? He died on the cross for you. He'll forgive you. He has great patience. He'll wait until you're ready. - Wouldn't he think I was doing it because of Sammy? - Are you? - No. I want to do what Sammy did. But I was afraid my father'd get mad at me. - He sees the truth in your heart Matt. You can never fool him. Never. - Sammy once told me that people are like rooms. And that the Lord will only come in if we unlock the door. - Behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him. - Jesus, I'm sorry I waited so long to open the door of my heart. I've done a lotta wrong things. But with your help, I'll make them right. Forgive me. I love you. And I want you to be my Savior, right now. Thank you. Sammy loves Jesus. You know much Sammy loves you. Please, give me the chance to tell Sammy how sorry I am for the things I said to him. He's my brother. And I love him Jesus. Help me find him. I've gotta go talk to Mom and Dad now. - We'll both go. - I know, I'm hungry too. Someone will find us. - Oh Phil, oh I'm so glad you're here. (tense music) - Tom? - He got this when he was just a little baby. I didn't even know he still had it. I hardly ever come into the boys' rooms. I've always been so busy. - Tom. - I don't think I told him I loved him since... He got this little bear. It was just a... I was just too busy. - Sammy knows you love him Tom. - Then why would he run away? - I don't think he would run away. - Don't they know I'm roughing them because I don't wanna see them hurt. - The boys know how you feel about 'em Tom. - You don't run away from somebody you love. - Sometimes you do. - No. When you know you're loved, you don't run away. (thoughtful music) - You did. - God doesn't love me. Look at Sammy. - Alright, look at him. I see a gentle, loving little boy. He's quick, intelligent. - And I see a cripple. Is that what you're saying? - No, I'm saying what I see. - Yeah, right. I know how stupid this all sounds. God knows how wrong I've been. - Yes he knows. - I avoided you Phil, because you reminded me of... - Of what you are? A child of God. You were from the moment you first accepted him when we were kids. You can't run away from him. - You're right. I can't. Oh Lord forgive me. Lord, help me. Help me. - I'm sorry to be such a crybaby Jesus. I know you won't tell anybody. I know your father has a reason for everything. But Moses and me, we need your help. Soon. Help! Help! (screams) (knocking at door) - Hi Matt. Hey listen, you said you were looking for your little brother? I saw him yesterday. - Where Sid? - He was going down the junkyard about six o'clock yesterday morning. - The junkyard! Of course! - What is it Matt? Why would Sammy go to a junkyard? - Come on Dad. - [Pastor Clemmons] Let's take my car, it's out in front. - [Mrs. Redding] Alright. (suspenseful music) - I tried to think like Sammy. He was thinking of a way to make me feel better. - I don't understand. He must've gone to find a radio. I yelled at him, so he knew I was hurt. Sammy would try to think of a way to make me happier. - You mean a radio? - Right. I knew he wouldn't run away, because he wouldn't hurt Mom and Dad like that. - Then why didn't he come home? - I don't know. (yelling) (machines rumbling drown out voices) (yelling) - [Mr. Redding] Sammy! - Sammy! - [Pastor Clemmons] Sammy! - Sammy! - Sammy! - Sammy! - Sammy! - [Mrs. Redding] Where are you? Sammy? - Sammy! Moses! Dad, that's Moses. That's where Sammy is. - Sammy! Oh Sammy! Oh, are you alright? - [Sammy] Yeah. Gee, am I glad to see you. - [Mrs. Redding] Oh Sammy, oh my God. - Yes Lord. Thanks. - I'm sorry for causing all the trouble. Are you mad at me? - [Mr. Redding] No. - Not even a little? - No. We were a little worried. - Just a little worried. - He's hungry I think. - Me too. - Me too. (gentle music) Thanks Phil. - Not me. - Thanks, Lord. - [Narrator] Behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him. (exalting music)
