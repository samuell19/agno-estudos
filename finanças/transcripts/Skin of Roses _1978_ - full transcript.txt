Sure, excuse me. - Cheers. - Cheers. You're always so pretty, madam. Directed by katsuhiko fujii directed by katsuhiko fujii did you find yourself the right man? Did you find yourself the right man? Mr. imamura, we're closing. Please wake up! Come on, wake up! Alright. Thank you. Madam, could I have some water? Sorry, we're closing. Aren't you early today? Madam, I need to announce something. Hey, what is it about? I came to say goodbye tonight. I got transferred to our main office in Osaka. We're honored you celebrated with us. I regret I never managed to make you mine. You're such a gentleman. Let me see you out. Right. - Goodbye. - Thank you. What's so funny? Madam, there so much I wanted to tell you tonight. I didn't have a chance. Wait for me there. Madam. I thought I'd give you a goodbye present. That won't do. Why? I need much more than a goodbye present. No present would fulfill my heart. There. - Refill. - Sure. You saw that? Ritsuko wasn't faking it tonight. She's a good actress. - You're probably jealous. - Idiot! - Yes? - It's ryuji. Thank you for tonight. Here is your fee. Thank you. So that was your last? Right. How long is it gonna take? Let's go. Coming out now. Say... After you pay them back tomorrow, you'll be free, right? I'm so sorry. I dragged you both into this. We wouldn't have had it any other way. How could I abandon you under such circumstances? Who is that tetsu you mentioned? Idiot! - Fish cake. - Sure. I wouldn't expect you to get it. He and ritsuko welcomed me like family. He's a good man. Ritsuko, when tetsu comes back... We'll run away from that doomed city. Yes. Help! Come back! Someone help me! Ryuji, why did you accompany her? We hope you'll pay us the 500,000 yen that are left tonight. - That's insane! - Stay out of this! We can't come up with that amount tonight. Her show usually brings in 200,000 yen. We just need an exceptional show worth 500,000 yen. How long will ritsuko have to endure that? - Don't play boss with me. - Mr. aoki! I've had to do your dirty shows to pay you back. You're dragging us down. Dirty shows, she says. You bet. If tetsu knew about it, what would he think? You imposed it on us by force. I just offered you a good opportunity for quick money. We need it all tonight. You know we don't have it. Let us meet the boss. He'll understand. Sure, I can show understanding. Ritsuko, I know someone who can help you. Mr. kamishima, my attorney, a professor of law. The professor wants to keep you as his mistress. I won't do that. How will you pay us back? If you don't pay, it could get ugly. Excuse me. Mr. mihara, I'm sure you'll manage. - She has quite a temper. - That's the way I love them. I enjoyed watching her show. Ritsuko doesn't need us. She'll find money anyway. Aoki. That woman is ours. Forget about tetsu. Tetsu from the kawada gang, who is serving time? He's just a clown. He wanted to quit for her and tried one last heist. He had to pay 10,000,000 to withdraw from our operations. His woman has to work it off now. You guys are merciless. How much is your mercy for her worth, professor? So you expect me to pay for her? Sir, don't give me that look. I known how much you want her. No need to brood over it. This will relax you. - Let's run away. - Idiot! If it was possible... I'd have done it long ago. Tetsu is coming soon. We wait for him here. That's right. How much we had to go through to pay off his debt. We'll find the money. What do you have in mind? I hate that! I'm not going back to working at a turkish bath! No one is asking for your help. - I'd refuse anyway. - And we're not asking! You're not even one of us. What? How can you say that? I'm not an outsider. Come on, both of you! I'm responsible for this situation. - Call them back. - Ritsuko. What? What is it? Gentlemen, get out through this door. Hurry! Quickly! Quickly! This is the police! Open the door! I can hear them in there! Quick, open up! Shinjuku ward police central Idiot, don't yawn like this in public. Who cares, after what we've been through. Isn't it a strange coincidence? How could they come at the right time? I agree with you. And they got their hands on the money. Damn! Thank you for your service. Captain. That was a blow. Ritsuko, you owe your speedy release to the professor. May I offer the madam lunch? Right, come. - Ritsuko. - Don't worry. Are you jealous? Give me some space! Don't worry about tetsu. You did all you could to help him. Why would you want to go back to an ex-convict. And who sent my man to jail? Is that aimed at me? You're confused. - Let me get off. - Mr. mihara... Could you give us some privacy? We need a moment so we can't talk at ease. Hey, drop me off here. - Let me out. - Ritsuko. You live by yakuza honor. Don't make me lose face. You get it? Go. There you go. What the hell? Who the hell are you? Hey! Come here! Stop! Let me go! Hey! What do you want from me? Why did you steal her money? - Speak! - Enough! What did the professor want from you. Mihara sold me to him. Shit! You were set up from the start. - Wait. - I'll settle it. Don't be a fool. - They'll kill you. - I don't care about that. - They played us. - Don't be a fool. Ritsuko. You intend to let them dispose of us? - Of course. - What? Am I talking to you? You finally came. I was sure you'd come around. You're the woman I need. I have set up this place... Precisely for a real woman like you. Let me show you what I expect from you. I want you to understand... How much I love you. Love is a petty word to convey my feelings. Please allow me to worship you. Please, let me be your slave. My mistress, please abuse me. Please abuse me! Order me around! I'll be your horse or your dog! Please, mistress. Please, let me be yours. Please don't stop! More! Whip me more, my mistress. More, I'm begging you! Whip me more, mistress. Please, abuse your slave. Let me... Let me be yours! I'm begging you! My mistress, I'm begging you. Please whip me more. I'm begging you, mistress. More, please! Allow me to be yours. Papa. Akira, come rest. Drink some juice. I want to play! Come on, you need to rest. No! Akira, listen to me. Akira! Professor kamishima. I have something to sell. What do you want? You think you can play Mr. mihara with that? Your little Akira is in good hands. Akira. You! Your wife is respected in the legal circle. I'm sure anyone would pay for these photos. Papa! Papa! How much do you want? 1,000,000 yen. In cash. In cash? It's Sunday. I could sign a check now. And I'm demanding 1,000,000 cash. Yuri, did they deliver the futon? Yes, it's here. Good. Sorry, it's so hot in here. It's alright, it's only for 5 days. You sure they won't find us here? "The darkest spot is at the foot of the lighthouse." They won't expect us to hide so close. They'll look first in the country inns. They'd never figure us renting an apartment. Are you sure you should wait for tetsu in shinjuku? It's not like that. First he'll visit his friends from sendai. It's not safe to rush. It's the newspaper. Yuri, buy us some food. - Be careful. - Alright. She's such a klutz. You guys can take the big room. I'm embarrassed. You two are almost a couple now. I don't know how she feels about that. Are these tetsu's clothes? Tidying them all up was such a chore. You did that all night? Well, he's coming out at the peak of the heatwave. He'll need all his summer clothes. Tetsu will be so happy. Damn, the professor is such a bastard. I thought he'd have 1,000,000 yen lying around his house... But he barely put together 400,000. What can we do? We'll beg the gang for mercy. Enh? If we bring them a girl, we can always negotiate. But we won't do that. We have to hang on to our plan now. You wouldn't want harm to befall me. You silly goose. Hey... - Could you fuck me? - What? Ritsuko is right in the next room. But we never do it! Hey... It's too hot! You're obviously in love with her. I'll slap you! Come on. She's tetsu's woman. I'd do anything for tetsu. Why do you always talk about tetsu? If you need to know... Tetsu took my place in jail. That's a lie. It's not! The heist he pulled off with the kawada gang... I was supposed to do it. I was so scared he had to cover for me. Do you understand now? Does ritsuko know that? She never held it against me. I see. So that's what it was. Ryuji. I like you. Don't tell ritsuko we don't have the money. Ok. Fucking idiot! What does she think she's doing? So stupid. She has nowhere to go. Damn. Ryuji? Is that you, ryuji? Sorry I woke you up. Yuri is gone. Enh? When I woke up, she was gone. Why would she sneak out? I'll look for her. Should I go with you? It's ok, ritsuko. Ryuji! Enough with that. Come on, finish it already. Youth is so beautiful. Look at these buns! She's so stupid. People are unpredictable. She'll be fine! She'll come back. You can relax. Thank you. Stupid. - She's causing trouble. - It's alright. I'm the one causing trouble. I'm worrying everyone around me... Including Yuri. Yuri! I'm sorry. Are you kidding me? Where were you? Tell Mel Yuri! Talk to Mel! Where were you? I made money to cover our expenses. 30,000 yen. What? Yuri, do you know what you did? So what? Can't I make money too? You moron! I'll show you! It hurts! Ryuji, that's enough! - Enough! - Stop it! Ryuji! Stop it, please! - Stop! - Stay out of this! I told her something I shouldn't have. Ryuji, please calm down. Ritsuko, go to the other room! - Ryuji! - You damn idiot! - Ok, I'm sorry! - Idiot! Idiot! Who told you to make money on the street? It's because I love you. What a stupid girl... Yuri, you're so stupid. Yuri! What a stupid girl. Yuri! - Where are you going? - I need to buy some stuff. Idiot! Tetsu is coming out today. The gang will be sniffing around. Then I'll report it. You've done enough already. Don't worry, I'm not as dull as you are. My darling. My darling! My darling! My darling! My darling... Ritsuko, a cool breeze is blowing. It may even look like rain. Take me. Fuck me! Fuck me! - Take me. - Ritsuko! Please! Ritsuko. Ryuji. Ryuji. I was indecent. You. How could you do that? I hate you! Yuri! - Yuri, wait! - Leave me alone! - Yuri! - Don't touch me! Yuri! Hey, aren't you Yuri? - So what? - What are you doing here? Come with me. Don't push your luck! Where is ryuji hiding? - I don't know. - You don't know? You don't have to tell me... But then I'll have to give you one right there. Enh? Look how big these are. Hey, what are you doing? Don't do that! Stop! If ryuji is doing you, we can all do you. Don't! No! Stop it! - Guys, leave her alone! - Oh, that's right! You're a fag! Ryuji didn't do anything wrong! No! - I'll go first. - I'm second. Don't! She's the evil one. Who? Ritsuko! Enough! This is is not the right place for your games! Go somewhere else! Get out! Out, now! No! So ryuji and ritsuko are together? Yes. I eave me... Where's ritsuko? Where is she? She's in Okubo... 2 chome... Azalea mansion. Good girl. Go. That hurt, you bastard! Come here! There! Ryuji! - Ryuji! - Ritsuko! - Move! - Please don't! - Stop! - Hey, ritsuko... No! You'll go in the other room. Stop! Ritsuko, I'm here! What? Asshole! Please stop! Calm down! Ryuji! Professor. Ritsuko... You made me look like a fool. Leave her out of this! It's all my fault! It's all my fault! Ryuji! Ryuji! I'm the one to blame for all of this! Then you're ready for the consequences. You're brave. I was set up from the start anyway. No matter how hard I tried... You'd do anything for tetsu, isn't that right? Hey, do it. - Stand up! - Don't! What are you doing? Stop! Captain, please don't do this! You animals! When tetsu comes back... He'll beat you to a pulp! Stop... Hey! That's it. You can go! - Professor. - Yes. Aren't you the eternal victim? Don't do it! Why are you doing this? Stop! Please, stop this! Stop! Ritsuko! Ritsuko! Captain. Ritsuko, it seems tetsu won't come for you. That's a lie! Tetsu is dead now. That's a lie! Those are his... They belong to him, it's a lie! It's a lie! I don't believe you. Believe it or not, I went to pick him up in sendai. He was killed on the way back. My darling. My darling! I don't believe you! Kakimoto from the kawada gang killed him. Bastard! Shit! - Bastard! - Ryuji! Ryuji! Ryuji! Ryuji... Ryuji... Ryuji... Ryuji! Ryuji! Ryuji! Come on! Shut her up! Ryuji! Ryuji! What are you? Are you even human? See, now ryuji can be reunited with tetsu. Now, you'll be the delight of the professor. It's seems I got it all wrong. These little bells are your lover. The professor is a pervert! He wanted to drink my pee. He's depraved! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! My darling... Darling... Tetsu is dead now! There, there... There, there... Darling.., - darling... - That's right. Since these bells are so dear to you, they're all yours. Here. My darling... My darling... - My darling... - That bastard. You still crave tetsu's embrace. You bitch in heat! The end
