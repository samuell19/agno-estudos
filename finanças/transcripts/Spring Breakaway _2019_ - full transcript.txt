Okay, Kevin with a "K", enjoy your day. You've really made mine. Next. Ma'am. Ma'am. Oh, me? I'm sorry, I've never been called ma'am before. Oh! Lucky you. Yeah, I guess there's a first time for everything. ID and bag. Today. You got it, ma'am-- sir. I mean, sir. You know, I'm actually going on a ski trip with a bunch of people from school. My boyfriend's coming. He's great. But he's not exactly friends with my friends, so I was kind of hoping that this could be their time to bond, right. - Please proceed. - Really? Mike, I was just worried-- No, ma'am, you can proceed to the security line. 6-D, as in "depart my presence." - Today. Next. - Okay. That doesn't sound promising. Spring break, baby! Here we come! Ski trip? More like ski lit! - Am I right? - Doesn't really rhyme, but I dig the enthusiasm. Yo! Can you guys keep it down? I'm right at the good part of "Wicked." She's defying gravity. I hate spring break. Attention, flight 2048 to Tugboat Springs. We clearly have a storm on our hands, people, but we're gonna try to get you out of here on time. And out of my airport. Do you think I should put the photos of Celeste and my dad at the back? They're my best ones, so I want to end with a bang, you know? Babe? Are you watching the A games replays again? Dude, this is important to me. Yeah, I know she's my cousin, but she's also, like, a super legit photo journalist and I want to impress her. Thanks, babe. I know that you think I'm talented. Yeah, so I'll be in Austin by tonight, but I just have to fly through Miami. You don't think I'm a horrible person for leaving while my dad's in the hospital, do you? Luke? Okay, call me when you discover that I'm more important than motocross. We are now boarding first class passengers on Flight 2048 with service to Miami. Well, you've been the best part of my day. Don't forget this. Thank you. - Next. - Hi. I'm sorry, but did you happen to see a guy walk through here with fluffy hair, dopey smile, like yea tall? Honey, you're going to have to be a little more specific, okay? 'Cause all teenage boys have fluffy hair. That's a good point. You see, it's just-- Oh, here we go! Everybody from school is going on this ski trip, even my best friend Brody. He's basically popular now, which is super weird. Anyway, I have to go to Miami to visit my grandparents, and we're trying to meet in the airport so we can say bye, 'cause it's been a pretty crazy few weeks. Do I look like Dr. Phil to you? Shiny little bald head, little moustache, talks too much like this on TV? - Who? - Were you even born yet? I don't know how to answer. I kind of see, like, he was older maybe? - Like, I could-- you could-- - It was a rhetorical question. Thank you for the "old" comment. - ID. - I didn't mean it like that. Reach for the orange backpack now. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you. I got-- yeah. Hi, hi. So sorry. Security took forever, and I also had to stand in line for 20 minutes for a seven dollar water bottle. Airports are insane. It's fine. You're here now. I'm so excited for you to get to meet everybody. The girls called the first run, and then they kind of want to go snowboarding. - So I was kind of thinking-- - Do we really have to go skiing? I mean, it-- I mean, it is a ski trip. I was kind of imagining that skiing would be involved, yeah. Don't you just wanna curl up, you know, the two of us, you know, by a cozy fire, hot cocoa? Yeah, there'll definitely be time for that. This whole scene is just-- it's just kind of a lot for me. Kind of a lot? Drake, these are my friends. Yeah, but I'm here for you, not them. Come on, we've talked about this. You're always busy with rehearsal, and it'd be nice if you could spend some time with new people, people that I care about. Middle, fourth, pinky bend, snap, and deal. Middle, fourth, pinky bend, snap, and deal. Middle... Do you need a volunteer or something? Uh... Wow. That was somehow both terrifying and impressive. I get that a lot. I'm Effie. - Zoe. - Where you headed, Zoe? My grandparents' place in Miami. My brother was supposed to go, but he got the flu, so I'm on my own. Well, I'm supposed to go on Crown Lake's school ski trip, - but snow is not really my thing. - Huh. I'd much rather be headed to Miami and straight into a salsa club where I'd fall into the arms of a muscley gentleman named Armando, and we'd dance the night away. You just go to Miami by yourself? Uh, yeah. Now, come on. Show me that trick you were doing. I've got a lot of time before this flight and I want to be entertained. - You can do better than that. - I know. You've never even made an effort to get to know my friends. I'm not dating your friends. I'm dating you. But, Drake, it's important to me that you get to know them. What's so bad about alone time? Do you hear how selfish you're being? You know what's selfish? You dragging me on this trip when you're not even gonna hang out with me, - and I don't even like to ski. - Okay, I'm sorry, but I've planned multiple group hang-outs and you always bail to do theater stuff. Sorry that I have a hobby that I actually stick to. Are you serious? Right now? Great. Everyone, everyone, please remain calm. Especially you over there with the screaming baby. Now we need to get you out of here before the next batch of bad weather comes in, so listen very carefully. Flight 204-- Flight 2084, please begin boarding out of Gate 48. And gate-- Flight 2048, you will be boarding out of Gate 47. All right? Just give me your boarding passes and get on the plane. I mean, honestly, just get on a plane at this point. I really don't care. Thank you so much. Have a lovely trip. I can't believe I'm about to do this before we have to spend a week together. - Do what? - I'm breaking up with you. You're breaking up with me? Right at the start of the trip? This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go get a Chai tea and probably listen to something calming like "Phantom." We'll figure this out in Tugboat Springs. See you on the plane. Wow. A true talent. Well, I guess I should go now. It was nice meeting you. You, too. Unless... what if I went to Miami instead? Uh, how? Let's go catch our flight. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I really hate spring break. I don't know, Harmony. We just-- we broke up. Now I have to spend a whole entire week with him. Ladies and gents, that was the final boarding call for flight 2084 to Tugboat Springs. If you need me, I'm heading to the bar to enjoy a nice, strong margarita. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. ♪ I told you months ago it was over ♪ ♪ Broke your heart ♪ I broke your heart in a million ways ♪ ♪ The right one, but the wrong time ♪ Do you need any help with that? I've got it.

I didn't show you the card. Just take it, yeah. Folks, this is your captain speaking. Let me be the first to welcome you to sunny Miami, Florida. It is a beautiful 78 degrees with light winds from the North. Apologies for the weather delay leaving Attaway. If you've missed your connecting flight... Great. Missed my connection to Austin. Miami. I can't wait to find an Armando. Ar-man-don't. Are you sure you can handle this, just hanging out in Miami by yourself? Have a little faith. Sure you don't want to come with? My grandparents would kill me. But here's my phone number in case you need anything. Zoe! At least I got one number today. Thanks, Grandma. Okay, I'll see you soon. Um, excuse me. Does that sign say Miami? Yeah. Is there a problem? Yeah, why aren't we in Tugboat Springs? Like, for the ski trip? My friend Brody is going on that, but I have to visit my grandparents. Which is where we are. Here. In Miami. Were you supposed to go on-- The ski trip. Well, that explains the outfit. What am I gonna do? I mean, my family's in L.A. and all my friends are in Tugboat. Why don't you come with me and stay with my grandparents. At least until you figure out what to do. I'm Zoe Valentine, by the way. Oh, I know who you are. I'm Rhyme. - I saw you in the musical. - Sure did, partner. Are you dating that guy? He's, like, really cute. Well... yeah? Kind of. I don't know. We just broke up. Oof. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Well, my offer still stands about coming to my grandparents. Are you sure about that? You barely even know me. You look like a snowman that likes warm hugs. I think it's safe to say you're not an ax murderer. So, come on. Yeah, now I'm stuck in Miami and all of the flights are canceled. It's just a disaster. Yeah, I'll call you when I'm at the hotel. Okay, bye. Excuse me, but did you say hotel? Is there an issue with that? Okay. I am loving this energy. I'm Effie and I wanna hear your, like, entire life story. I'm Autumn. To be honest, I don't really know what my life story is right now. I'm just gonna take one of those hotel shuttle things and work my magic. Feeling you! Let's ride. Thank you guys so much for rescuing us, mister and missus... Oh, please, you can call us Dorothy and Don. Yeah, thanks for lunch, Grandma and Grandpa. I hope you guys enjoy your authentic Cubanos. They're a Floridian delicacy. Ham, cheese, more ham. I'm sold. Yeah, it looks delicious. Nowhere near as delicious as you! - Come over here. - Oh, Grandma. Stop. You gals are gonna love it here. Yeah, we got bingo, shuffleboard, geriatric water aerobics. Did I mention bingo? I don't know how we're gonna do it all in one week. And on Tuesday morning, there's women's powerwalk. I am so sorry. This is probably not what you had in mind for your spring break. Well, what else am I gonna do? I don't have any money. And besides, geriatric water aerobics kind of sounds relaxing. My hip has been bothering me since the musical. Come on, let's eat up! Thanks, Alberto. You're a real one. You're such a woman of the people. I love it. Suck it, Crown Lake! Your girl is living in the lap of luxury. But, wait. Where are we gonna stay? I honestly hadn't thought that far ahead. Let's just explore our options. This way. Uh, what are you doing? Looking the part. What's the part? A soon-to-be divorcee who got half her money from her rich old husband. I'm, like, so flattered. That's how you describe my sense of style. Okay, now don't say anything and follow my lead. My cousin pulled this off once. I think. Ah, darling! Welcome to La Mirada Hotel and Spa. Hi. We have a reservation for the king suite under St. George, Autumn. Hmm. Ahh. Aww. Computer says no. That's impossible! We made this reservation months ago! This is a disaster of an establishment! My father, the prime minister, will be hearing about this. And I wouldn't be surprised if he bought this dump and fired all of you posthaste! Effie. Well, you ladies are more than welcome to pay upfront with a credit card. That will be $345 for a one night stay. Oh, Autumn, darling, we're simply staying at the wrong hotel. You see, we're staying at the El Mirado, not the La Mirada. Our mistake, Lester darling. Bye-bye. Well, that was a bust. 'Cause someone couldn't keep her mouth shut. Hey. Did I hear that you guys need a place to stay? Who are you and why are you following us? I'm Andrew. I'm a tennis pro here at the hotel, and kind of know the ins and outs of the place. Are we supposed to be impressed? Down, Effie. I'm Autumn. And, yeah, we're technically stranded here. So if you did have somewhere we could crash, that would be kind of amazing. - I think I can help. - Yes! Take us to our suite posthaste. - Um-- - Effie, you can drop the accent now. Do you even know what posthaste means? You guys can follow me. We'll try something. I'm sure you'll send somebody for these. I mean, hey, it doesn't look like much, but we can move some stuff around. Maybe get a cot or two in here, and, yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, pretty cozy. Uh, yeah. No. There's no way we're staying here. This is spring break, not prison. Andrew, there has to be a better option. - Please? - Okay, let me-- Let me talk to my boss and I can see what I can do. I like him. Eager to please. Is this what you guys had in mind? This is amazing, Andrew. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. - It'll do. - Seriously? Just kidding. It's perfect. How did you manage to pull this off? Honestly, two workers quit this week and we are understaffed for a wedding, and I said you guys would work for free lodging, so... I'd do just about anything to stay in this room. What do we have to do? You guys will be maids for the week. We're in. - Cool. Awesome. - Great. Hey, do you need any help with that? Wait, weren't you on the plane? Oh, yeah. Hi. Sorry, I didn't really get to introduce myself. You sat down. I was kind of afraid you were gonna bite my head off. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I had just broken up with my boyfriend when you saw me, so... Don't worry about it. I totally get it. I'm Ezra. Rhyme. Are you from Attaway? Millwood. But my dad's getting married here - on the weekend. - In Florida? Yeah, the woman he's marrying is from here, and her parents live in this beautiful gated community. What about you? Well, long story short, I am staying with my friend's grandparents, but there's only so many games of bingo a girl can play. Well, we're all heading into Miami this afternoon for the rehearsal dinner. You're welcome to come along if you'd like. Oh, can my friend Zoe come along, too? Sure. Wow, this place is gorgeous. Much better than the amenities at the retirement community, - I'll say that. - Okay, come on. You know that the water aerobics are a little fun. What are you, like, 97? Need a fresh towel? - Effie? - Zoe? - What are you doing here? - Autumn? Rhyme, right? - From the dance team? - Actually, I quit. - Hi, I'm Zoe. - Hi. Autumn. - Effie. - Rhyme. So, what are you guys doing here? Well, I missed my connection to Austin, so I took one of those, like, hotel shuttle thingies. And this boy who worked here said that we could have a room in exchange for working as maids. That didn't last long. Yeah, Effie did more harm than good cleaning the room, so they sent us out to the pool deck. What are you guys doing here? It's actually kind of crazy. I ran into this guy from our flight and he invited us to a party here. An eligible bachelor at a poolside soiree? Count... me in. Oh, um, I don't know. He didn't say I could bring anyone. Darling, one should always travel with an entourage and-- but first I think we all need a little makeover. - I like this dress. - But I like this. Yeah, no, I hate my outfit. Come on, let's go to the suite. - Suite? - Oh, yeah. Oh, our drinks. - These were so expensive. - So expensive. Impressive. Oh, it's like laying on a cloud. Meanwhile, Rhyme and I are sleeping on a pullout couch - from 1977. - It is fun and vintage. You guys should just stay with us. - We'll squeeze. - I don't know. The home isn't that bad. And, besides, I am way up in Mahjong right now. I am sorry, Rhyme, but are you insane? This is what spring break is supposed to be, not puzzles and bingo with my grandparents. Besides, you just went through a breakup. You deserve a nice trip. Okay, fine. But we really do need to call Dorothy and Don and tell them - that we're staying here. - Okay, of course. Okay, okay, enough chitchat. It's time for a hot Miami makeover. ♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪ You fell into his life, girl ♪ Rhyme, is that your man? He's muy caliente. He is not my man. But maybe a good rebound. Hey, you guys made it. Uh, yeah, I brought a few extra friends, if that's okay. Of course, the more the merrier. This is Autumn, Zoe, and Effie. Nice to meet you guys. Thanks so much for having us. So, is there a buffet situation on the premises or... Yeah, right over there. - Yeah. - I'm gonna go check on her. Actually, I'm gonna go say hi to someone, too. Hey, come down here and I'll get you a drink. Yeah, okay, sure. It's official. I'm proposing to this buffet. It all looks so good. Zoe, your plate is so sparse. And what is that? A salad? Um, okay. Well, I thought it might be nice to have a vegetable. I will never understand you. Karen, please stay! Elena, I know you're the bride, but you have made planning this wedding impossible. - You want elegant yet casual. - Yes. - You want jewel tones and pastels. - Claro. You can't make up your mind about anything, and it's exhausting me! - Karen, if it's money-- - It's not. The sound of your shrill voice will haunt me to the grave. I quit! Best of luck to you. So sorry to interrupt, but my family owns an event planning business and we deal with drama like this all the time. I'm kind of the queen of problem solving. Who are you? Just the best wedding planners in Miami. - We're friends of Ezra's. - It sounds like you need help, and I help my mom with events every weekend. So, we can get this wedding whipped into shape in no time. - We can? - We can. - Really? - Yeah. Great. You guys take over. - Wait, what? - Really? I'd like a detailed proposal from you as soon as possible. All the supplies we've already purchased are in the suite. The concierge will show you. Good luck! Okay, wait! Okay. Don't freak out. I have this all under control. How are we supposed to just plan a wedding? Zoe, this is literally my family's business. - I'm an expert. - Okay, great, but I don't know anything about weddings, so what am I supposed to do? I can't do this alone. Yay. Fine. Really? Great! I've always wanted an assistant. Let's go. - Hey. - Oh, Autumn, hey. Still on the clock? Yeah, just finished up. Nice. Oh, hey, you hungry? - Always. - Sure, let's go. Okay. This is... Beautiful, right? Oh, um, do you want-- sit? Do you want to sit? Sit? Yeah. - Sure. - Okay, okay. No! Stop! No, it's cute. It's fine. You're good. - No, let me see it. - It's post-worthy. No-- oh, you're actually really talented. Thanks. Yeah, so, um, what exactly brings you here? Well, I was supposed to go to Austin to see my cousin. She's this big photojournalist, and I was gonna learn the ropes from her, but I missed my connection. I mean, it's fine, because Miami's kind of growing on me. I'm sorry you don't get to see your cousin, though. It's all right. I mean, things have been pretty crazy at home for the last few months, so it's-- it's nice to get away. - I mean, I love my family, but-- - Yeah. No need to explain. My parents think I'm working here to save money for college. But, truth is, it's just nice to take a step away from life for a minute. You know, just relax and not have to answer to anyone. It's really sweet what you did for us. Yeah, you know, I like to help when I can. Why, is that a bad thing? No, no. It's-- It's just I'm not used to people wanting to help me out. Well, you deserve it, so... So then he says, "Apples and pears, up the stairs. It's cockney rhyming! It's slang!" That's my dad. - Keith. - He seems fun. That's the woman he's marrying. Elena. Do you like her? Yeah. She's nice. At least, sometimes. Sometimes it feels like we couldn't be any more different, aside from the fact she's Cuban and my dad and I are super British. Planning the wedding has been rocky, too. Our families don't exactly get along. It's all just a lot. I haven't had the easiest time with it. I think my dad might want to kill me. I guess I just never really expected my dad to remarry, that it would just be the two of us. I don't know what it's gonna be like when I have a new mum. Sorry to unload all this on you. I've known you for what, five hours? No, no, don't be sorry. I get it. Things never turn out the way that you expect them to. I mean, I'm not even supposed to be in Miami, but here I am. And even though things didn't go according to plan, maybe that's not a bad thing. 'Cause I mean, look, it brought me to this amazing place, and new friends, and... Hey, I'm glad you're here. Yeah, me, too. Hey, guys, this is Andrew. He plays tennis here and hooked us up with that suite room, so be nice. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you guys. Ezra! Ezra! Ezra! Oh, did you hear? The wedding planner, she quit and she took the photographer! - Dad, I'm so sorry. - This is a disaster. It's gonna be okay. We'll figure it out. Wait, wait, wait. You're a photographer, right? Hardly. I just like to take pictures. Okay, you literally just described being a photographer. Autumn, you should shoot the wedding. No way. I'm an amateur. Yes way. You can do this. Okay, we could take a few photos tonight and we'll show them what you can do. They won't be able to take no for an answer. Okay, let's go. ♪ Come to life ♪ Come to life ♪ Come to life ♪ I see you've got the fire inside you ♪ ♪ Hold it up and let it guide you ♪ ♪ It burns so bright that life will find you ♪ ♪ You got the power in your heart ♪ ♪ Come to life ♪ Come to life ♪ Come to life Sorry for all that back at the party. No, you were really, really sweet with your dad. Thanks. With all this going on, my dad would kill me if he knew I hadn't written the speech yet. Speech? I'm supposed to give one at the reception, but I don't even know where to start. I don't know much about writing wedding speeches, but I do know where you can get some inspiration. Really? Tell me. I'll do anything. - Movies. - Movies? Duh. Movies have some of the most epic wedding speeches of all time. We can watch the best ones and get you ready. Here's what I'm thinking-- lush, dramatic florals, candles. I want greenery, bamboo chairs, and a huge buffet. Small buffet. A conservatively sized buffet. I'll call you back. Um, we're almost over budget. Zoe, budget it no object when we're talking about a once in a lifetime event. Are you gonna explain that to Elena? On second thought, limitations force us to be creative. Right. So how much do we have? That's gonna require a whole lot of creativity. Yeah. Here. Thanks for helping me print these. They're so good, Autumn. You're really talented. - Thanks. - Now you have a portfolio to show the family and get the job. I know you could do it. What? Why are you so nice? I'm not this nice to everyone, just talented photographers. - So, um, yeah. - Yeah. - They look better than I expected, honestly. - Yeah. That was, uh, pretty good. Are you crying? No. Just misting up. So, are you feeling more inspired? Definitely. Though, watching movies all day with a cute girl doesn't exactly feel like homework. You're gonna love this next one. - Hey, are you okay? - What do you mean? Well, with your breakup and everything. That sounds really rough. Oh, yeah. I'm good, really.

I've never really done a big project like this, but if you guys wanted me to, I would totally be down for that. And, um-- I'm sorry I'm rambling a lot. And that's my vision for your beautiful union with Keith. Hmm. Thank you. That was great. I'll let you know my decision soon, hmm? Well, what are we supposed to do now? There's only one thing to do.

I think it's gonna be good. You're, like, glowing. You so love him. I do not so love him. Besides I just got out of a relationship. Autumn, what's going on with you and Andrew? I mean, you two have been spending a lot of time together. No, no, nothing. I have a boyfriend back home. - Wait, really? - Yeah. Yeah, Luke. He's really... great. He's really great. Boring! I want to find love in this hopeless place, too. - The jig is up. - Oh, God. You girls have not only started a small fire in the laundry room, you haven't even washed a single tablecloth. And there's a wedding here tomorrow - and that requires tablecloths! - I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, and I see you've acquired two stowaways. Pack your things and get out of here. - Immediately. - Okay, okay. Chop, chop! - Autumn. - Rhyme. - Where are you going? - We got kicked out of our room. I guess it's back to my grandparents. It was really nice meeting you. Good luck on your speech. - You'll do great. - Autumn, please don't leave. Your photos are beautiful. We would like to hire you for our special day. Really? - Yes. - Effie and Zoe, I'm not an easy woman to please. Could've fooled me. But the one thing I do like is your proposal. Wait, really? Not only did you present a fabulous vision, but you are almost $5,000 under budget. So we could've afforded an ice sculpture with flames - this entire time. - I'm sorry. You're both hired, and can stay in Karen the wedding planner's suite since she jumped ship. Oh, your friends could have the photographer's room. Yes! - We did it! - I knew it. I didn't, but yay! This is really working out. Come in. Whoa. You look really pretty. Thanks. Do you need help with that? Uh, yeah. So, are you nervous? On a scale of about one to ten, we're on 25 in the nerves department. Perfect. This looks straight-up terrible. I actually have no idea how to tie a bowtie. But I was pretty convincing, right? - Very convincing. - Do you wanna practice your speech for me? Sure. Turn around. You're making me too nervous. Friends and family from far and wide, thank you so much for joining us here today for the union of Keith and Elena. For so long, it's just been the two of us. He was a single parent, but he never failed to be the best dad in the universe, and spread love and positivity everywhere he went. Elena, I'm so happy that you make my dad so happy. He deserves it more than anyone. And we're happy that you're now a part of our not so little family. Life doesn't always go as planned, but that doesn't mean there isn't a happy ending. Cheers to the happy couple. Do you think that was all right? Uh, yeah. Um, I think-- I think that's great. Are you crying? No. It's time to go. You ready? Ready. Are you ready? Kind of. - The caterer's prepping-- - The passed appetizers. - And the florist? - Is finishing up the centerpieces. You know, my family could use the extra help for events. Thanks, but I think this was a one time thing. A kind of crazy one time thing. I'm gonna miss having you as my assistant. Come on, bring it in. Yeah. The lighting out here is perfect today. Thank you for helping me out. Of course. I'd never pass up a chance to hang out with you. - What? - Nothing. You're just cute when you're really focused. - Stop. - No, seriously. Andrew. I'm-- I'm so sorry. I have a boyfriend back home that I'm gonna try and make it work with. It's fine. I knew it was too good to be true. - It is what it is. - No, no. Andrew, you are honestly the nicest guy that I've ever met, and whoever ends up with you is really lucky. You deserve the best. I hope whoever you're with knows that. Oh, I'll make sure that he knows. - Friends? - Friends. Okay. - So, anyway. - So the-- yeah, yeah. By the power vested in me by the state of Florida, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. - Thank you. - I promised myself I wouldn't cry. Friends and family from far and wide, thank you so much for joining us here today for the union of Keith and Elena. For so long, it's just been the two of us. He was a single parent, but he never failed to be the best dad in the universe, and to spread love everywhere he went. Elena, I am so happy that you make my dad so happy. He deserves it more than anyone, and we're excited that you guys are now part of our not so little family. Life doesn't always go as planned, but that doesn't mean there isn't a happy ending. Cheers to the happy couple. Whoo! - Salut! - Good job, son. There are actually a few more people I'd like to thank. Without them, this night wouldn't have been possible. Effie and Zoe, you're 15 and you coordinated a better wedding than Miami's premiere event planner with 48 hours notice. Autumn, you immortalized some of my happiest moments of my new family's lives with your photography. And, Rhyme, I would've never had the confidence to get up here and say all this without you. You showed me that life is full of surprises in the best way. Thank you, guys. Go, Ezra! Yeah, Ezra! O-M-G. Do you just want to repurpose this wedding and get married to Ezra while we're all here? - Stop! - Rh-ezra! ♪ Put your hands up, if you feel it taking over ♪ ♪ Put your hands up ♪ If you're losing your composure ♪ ♪ If you love it, love it, love it ♪ ♪ Like I love it, love it, love it ♪ ♪ Put your hands up, put your hands up ♪ ♪ Put your hands up, hands up ♪ ♪ Just let it rain ♪ Like the tears that I cry ♪ Words don't mean much Can I have this dance? ♪ You said it was love Sure. ♪ And I believed every word I so ship them. - Same. - Same. My kids. My dad said they might be looking at houses in Attaway. Wait, would that mean that you'd be switching schools? I hear there's some pretty cute girls in Attaway. Shut up. I mean, at least one of them. I think she's around here somewhere. Wow, you really know exactly what a girl likes to hear. That's so romantic. I don't want you or your sarcasm to leave. Yeah, me neither. This is all just so perfect. I kind of feel like I'm in a dream. Yeah, well, you don't have to wake up now. ♪ I cry, oh, darling ♪ Oh, I... Thank you so much for the shirt. I missed you guys. Do you think that we have time for one more game of bridge before we leave for the airport? Oh, I think that can be arranged, sweetie. So glad you like it. Thank you for everything. Yeah, and good luck to you, and I can't wait to see all that you're gonna do. There you go. All right, well, you know, gotta get back to work. - Duty calls. - Teach the kids. - Yeah! - Do that tennis. Yeah, the tennis. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. I really don't want to say good-bye. Yeah, me neither. But maybe this isn't good-bye. What do you mean? Well, a wise woman once told me you never know where life will take you. That's what makes it so exciting. Huh. This woman seems pretty cool. But just to be sure, can I get your number? ♪ Four weeks in the summer - ♪ I should know better - See you later, Rhyme. ♪ Than to let things grow bigger than a kiss ♪ - That was so cute! - It was so cute! - Oh, my gosh! - Okay, Zoe. As soon as I get back home, I'm designing the posters for your student council campaign. Ready? "Zoe is a treasure. Vote her for treasurer." Uh, okay, that might need a little bit of work. - Just a bit. - Regardless, Autumn will shoot all your headshots and Rhyme will be our on-call life coach and speech writer. I don't want this week to be over. - I know. I don't want to go back. - Back to reality. But, hey, you guys, I've got an idea. What if, you know, no matter what, boyfriends or school trips, whatever, we go on spring break vacay together? - Uh, sign me up. - Yeah, okay. But this time, can we at least attempt to get on the right flight? - Maybe. - Yeah, yeah. - I love you guys. - I love you.
