Rosy, when is she going come see me my mother? I don't know zucchini. You think She's still mad at me? I do not think so. If your mom doesn't come to see you, it's that she really can't come. Let's go then. Raymond knows where it is, he can take me. We will see that tomorrow. You have to sleep. Until tomorrow. - Until tomorrow. Come in. excuse me to disturb you, I'm worried for the new one, Zucchini. He didn't quite understand that his mother was dead. He asked me when she was coming. than him did you answer?

When we watch TV or when egg skull drinks secret beer in the park. Here. That's the gun of the killer of blonde women. yes and he is coming where did this gun come from? From the news. From TV news.

The judge will soon receive you, maybe Raymond can take you there. Please note, for now you stay with us. You live here. Yes, but will he come? - If he wants to, yes. He would like, and after, we'll go see my mother. Zucchini, you have to you understand that your mom did not survive his injury. It means she's dead. - It's not true, she's coming back. No Zucchini, she won't come back. It's necessary you are very brave. She is angry, she does this when she's angry, but afterwards it always comes back. You haven't forgotten tomorrow, you monitor the inventory. Tomorrow I can't. I go to the judge, I'm taking the kid, Zucchini. Zucchini, who killed his mother? Yes, I don't like it. Why are you sticking to it? - I do not know. It's not up to us to do that. - Me, I obey. They tell me, I do. RAS. - You're right, we're going home. Why are they doing this? - They're orphans. The parents died in an accident. Orphans? - Children who no longer have parents. We have Rosy. - It is not the same. If it's the same. - You are too stupid sometimes. The ugly bobo. Stop Jujube, it goes two weeks, there is nothing. You saw ? It's your father ? He will come and get me and we'll both go to America. Are you going to Beverly Hills? - Yes and even further. Are you going to flirt with her? He's in love. - He's in love, he's in love! He's in love ! They discovered the fire and from there, Many things have changed.

Aren't you happy to see me? - Your uniform? I'm taking you to the judge. To be the driver, I don't need a uniform, let's go. Do you like the Trois Fontaines? - Okay. Rosy is nice, but we can't never watch TV. TV is your passion. Do you know the killer of blonde women? - It's in a movie, isn't it? He cuts the woman into slices, but no one finds it. Why you, don't you stop it? It's just a story a thriller, a series. Yes, a serial killer. It's not in real life. - If I saw him. He was cutting the girl and it was bleeding. I'm not telling you, a real butcher. Your dad, do you remember? - No, I was too young. He went around of the world with a hen. You never saw him again? I don't understand, hens do not travel. Your mom, did you like her? Yes she makes me real mash with potatoes. Do you often think of her? Did she beat you? You do not want to answer ? - I don't want to talk anymore. Why you don't want to talk to me anymore? I do not know. - Did you hit her sometimes? Sometimes, my mother, she annoys me. She watches TV time and no longer extinguishes it. I am like an invisible. - What ? She only speaks with the TV. What is he waiting for this idiot to kiss him? She dresses like a prostitute. Do you watch TV too? - Yes, I watch everything, even the games. Sometimes when we look a movie, mom is crying. love scenes, Reminds him of my stupid dad. Next ? - She tells me to go up to bed. Sometimes I come down and I find her asleep in front of the TV with its cans empty on the ground. If I switch off, it wakes her up and I take a slap. So I leave it on and I go back to bed. We will note all in the report. There will be an investigation but you will have to stay at Trois Fontaines. Mom will wonder why am I not coming back? You understood what did the psychologist say? Mrs Colette, she makes me play with ink stains. She told you that was your mom dead? I thought she was doing pretending and just sleeping. It's true Raymond is she really dead? I'll talk to his psychologist for her to work there. He must realize that he will never see again no longer his mother once and for all. Zucchini, calm down. Go ahead, it's late. In my opinion, they are already at the table. - I'm not hungry. Go down Zucchini. - I don't want you to leave. I have my job and I have my son too. It is not possible. Look, there's Rosy waiting. - Zucchini, at the table. Zucchini, are you eating? - I'm not hungry. You won't leave not the front table. You have not still haven't eaten. You are a mule head. You fell badly with me because me too. I told you what you are going to eat, come on. I'm not hungry. The director asks you. - I'm coming. you lose nothing to wait, eat and I'll be back. I'll take care of it. You had a hard day, come on, let's go to bed. You are cold ? Why do you have this jacket? If I don't clean as she wants, I do not eat. She gives me bread stale with sticky pasta. Sometimes disgusting meat. It's your mother ? - It's his aunt. She wants to fit me and become my tutor. She does this for the money. That's the only thing that interests him, I don't want to go back to her. She, she wants to take me back. It's not nice. - She has no right. Children, you come, we organize a game. Hurry up. You wanted to talk to me ? Come back later. I have an appointment. Could you call Raymond? - The gendarme ? I told you that is not possible. This policeman has his own life, his work, his wife and his children. Raymond, he no longer has wife, just her son. You only saw him once. - No, two. What does it change ? Why would he want to? Because, Raymond, I like him. So ? So with Victor, he doesn't laugh much. Zucchini, I'm going to ask Madame Colette to come see you, okay? Go take your snack now. Rosy, I lost my subscription. - Search well. I swear to you, he's not there. - You must have left it in your room. I left it in Raymond's car. - What is this big lie? Do you want us to phone to ask? When we went to the judge, it was after the pool. The subscription, I put it there. I'll manage. Rosy? Rosy? - Yes. You don't sleep yourself. - Did you call him? Between. Sit down. tell me zucchini this subscription story, did you invent it? I phoned Raymond. - It's true ? He searched everywhere. - He didn't find it. What did he say ? He talked about me? Do you like your policeman? - I don't care about him. He didn't say he was coming? - Nope. Want a story? I am no longer a baby. Go to sleep then. - I'm not sleepy.

Sometimes it seems everything is going slow. What are you thinking about ? To all the children who are with their mom and dad. We are all alone. Camille, I would like marry you.

Go, go away. What's the matter ? - No, but nothing. Did you release him? - Is it normal for him to hit him? I'm tired of your tantrums. - He's the one to lock up. Before it was different. Before what? - In Catherine's time. Stop talking to me about Catherine. You stop ! You have to take care of yourself. One two Three Sun, Watch out Beatrice. Not moving, you are under arrest. Raise your hands. If I don't want to? - I will be ruthless. yes you will kill me how did you kill your mother? It's not true. - You didn't kill your mother? It's not even true, you are just a liar. You pulled the trigger, you will go in jail with handcuffs. You do not have both finished? Get up, you got hurt ? How are you ? Come, it is not going good, no ? She was a seamstress and worked from home. A bunch of people came knocking at our door with a sewing button or a trouser hem. Because my mom had nimble fingers. Your father ? Precisely, he did not like not too all these visits. Above all men were coming. One day, he got fed up and he killed her. What ? Your father killed your mother? Yes. What's wrong? - No, it's fine. You are quite pale. - I'm telling you it's okay. Do you want us to go home? Me too, I killed my mother. He is right Simon, I killed her. I killed my mother with my father's gun. Everything is my fault. They will investigate and I'm going to jail. you are too small to go to jail. They will wait that I am big. I would have deserved it. I pulled the trigger. - Stop Zucchini, stop! Mr Dutilleul, here Mrs. Desbois of the foyer of the Three Fountains. I'm not bothering you ? - I'm listening to you. I call you about zucchini. What is he still happens to him? For three days, he is not feeling right. He doesn't speak anymore and he barely eats. He refuses to play with his comrades. He spends his days in the infirmary and we are all very worried. It happened something ? We don't know and to the psychologist, it means nothing. Why are you calling me? - We had an idea. We would like to do something to help and we thought of you. You are sure what is the job of a policeman? I you ask that privately. You help me ? There is no one in the lingerie. The director, myself and Madame Colette, we had a meeting. We talked about you and your appendicitis crisis, finally… you have us is scared to death. Madame Colette thought that might be a good idea to see your house again. You might think to your life before, to your mom? Too bad, we said to ourselves only to take you there, we could have ask Raymond. you would like to go there if it was Raymond? For that, you need find your tongue. Are you happy to come back here? Even to me you do not want to talk anymore. I want to cry. - You got your tongue back. That's where I found her with the remote control and its cans, coming back from school. She always said that we would go and see the sea, but we have never been there. We never did anything. These are memories. You can take things. - She didn't want us to touch it. Simon is right. - What did he tell you ? that I supported on the trigger. I have to go to jail, everything is my fault. No way, you didn't do it on purpose. If I hadn't played with the gun, it wouldn't have happened. I am a policeman and I know my job. It's an accident. Did you know it was loaded? So you see that you didn't want to kill her. It's not your fault. - Are you sure ? Do you remember ? Did you go up there? It's there that I saw you the first time. It was weird to me, with the shadows on the wall, I thought you were a giant. Are you going to go up and see? I'm hungry, aren't you? If you want, you can come and have a snack at home. What do you have ? - Victor doesn't like me. Victor, but not at all. In any event, he is at school. Viktor? - You do not work ? Did you skip class? - The teacher is sick. Just the day of the control! Victor, if you slip away at each math test, we're not going to get out of this. - She knows everyone. Hi. - Hi. He will taste with us. Where can't you find it? Geometry, trig? - Algebra, I don't understand anything. OK, we'll see that on Saturday. - No, Saturday, I'm going to Alex's. You cancel. - It's been planned for weeks. You will go another time. - You can't do this to me. You do it on purpose ? - Do you prefer the boarding house? Yes hello ? What bill? Oh yes, sorry, she's here. It's your mother ? How did she die? What can it do to you? - She was killed? Killed? - Murdered like on TV? Anything. My dad never talks about it. - Why ? They had an accident and he was driving. So ? - Then nothing. Why doesn't he want to talk? - I do not know. You are getting on my nerves with your questions. My collection, you're crazy, don't touch that. I'm not going to damage it. - It's expensive. You've gone too far you will pay for that. I can't leave you alone. It ruins my comics. - You could make an effort. It was he who hit me. - How old are you Victor? It's true, is it you who typed? You must learn to use the words rather than typing. You agree ? - Alright Raymond. Victor, you don't want your snack? I'm not hungry. - I'll leave it for you on the shelf. I bring the kid back and I take my service. You hear me ? I'm not deaf and I work. If you work, I leave you. It's my fault. - No, it has nothing to do with it. Viktor and me we never get to talk to each other. I will take you back. We are in no hurry, we can't go back until tomorrow. You don't lose the North. Why don't you have a gun? - If I have one, it's put away. I don't like guns. What's this ? - An old mini-cassette, a megaphone. Are you interested ? - I'm not sure it still works. You have to press both keys at the same time. There it works it's recording, go ahead and talk. I am the master of the samurai. Me, I am the policeman of interstellar space. I am the master of the samurai. Me, I am the policeman of interstellar space. If I hadn't fired the revolver, I wouldn't be here with you. I wouldn't have my friends, Camille, Simon and Ahmed. What are you talking about ? - With mom, I was always alone. I had no one to talk and to play. Now it's better. You can't say that Zucchini. - Whether. You are an optimist. - What is an optimist? When we see the bright side of life. Come on, come on. He couldn't find a job and he left in Tunisia last week. He didn't come looking for you? - I'd rather stay here with you. There's mashed potatoes today. He's your father after all. - I do not know him. You will go see it when you are older. Let me go, let me go! Children, stay here. Let me go, let me go! He got caught rummaging through the director's papers, he was reading educators' notes. That's why he knew everything. - He's fired. You don't don't look at the table. I don't want him to go. - Do you like her Simon now? Yes, he was annoying, but it was a bit like a big brother. you imagine yourself are you going to live with him? Why not ? People want adopt babies well, we are too old. Madame Colette says that people can become your godfather. What's this this nonsense again? Godfather, it's someone who takes care of you. It must have mortality. of morality, no mortality, you idiot. There is no one who wants us. - What are you going to do? We go to another home. I know a lot of people there, it's going to be cool. I won't stay there and I'm not going not spend my life in hostels. You are not allowed to smoke. - You're not going to do it too. Ciao. - Ciao. Hi. - Hi. Goodbye.

He will take me with him. you have too much want to leave my Courgette. Raymond, he will not come. He does not have Ask permission before. There is nothing to do permissions. Stop, you have to ask the judge first. - Nonsense. Stop with the swear words. - Nothing to do. I want to see the sea and I don't want stay here all my life. Ouch! Stop zucchini! Stopped. Frank! It is not going good, no ? What's the matter with you ? It's yours ? It's not up to you to do that. Come with me. What are you doing outside at this time? Come on, get on. No, just now. Wake up, wake up. What happened ? - She's the right woman. She dropped me here and they prevented me from leaving. Why did you run away in the middle of the night? - What bothers you? First you don't talk to me not like that, understand? Come on, come on. Where were you going like that? Answer. In Beverly Hills. - You don't even know where it is. I do not care. You believe you can leave without telling anyone? You ran away. - I do not care. You don't have any nothing to do with me and even if I die. Calms you. Alone at night on the roads, it's dangerous.

The judge decided that you had to live in a hostel. you must obey what the judge says. You understand ? Let's go. Can I go up front? - Yes. your belt, never forget it. I have never been to see the sea. - It's a shame, it's beautiful and big. Will you take me one day? - We'll see. We will see what the manager says. You go to study while I speak with the gendarme. You will be punished of a chore while waiting for more. Come. We won't get out of this. This kid needs another kind of monitoring. What are you planning to do ? - The Three Fountains does not suit him. Yes, the denial of authority, he is a child who refuses to obey. It's not that he refuses, is that he never learned. zucchini threatens the balance of the whole household. It gives bad ideas to his classmates. Madame Desbois asked up to the judge to find a solution and consider another establishment. The longer we wait, the more it will become impossible. In eight days, he's not here anymore, administrative decision. Say zucchini, do you have a present for Beatrice? A gift ? - It's almost his birthday. You have something ? - Do you think he'll like it? Don't eat them before the party. I will not be able to come, I am punished. Wednesday I go to court. - The day of the party? I will know if I go back at my aunt's or if I stay here. The tribunal, must be too classy. The manager told me that she will accompany me. That's a shame, i can't come with you to defend yourself. Beatrice, Beatrice, Beatrice! I have never had so many gifts. Start with this one. - Don't piss off. Stop saying bad words. - I didn't do anything. Take this one. From Jujube. I'm staying ! - Yes ! I will not go at my aunt's. They did a survey on it and I stay here with you. I'm staying ! Doesn't that make you happy? The judge said I stay here. do you like it you to stay here? I'm fed up, I want to leave, I want you to come with me. It's just a prison here, you did not understand ? If we stay together? Raymond had said that we would go to see the sea. He didn't care, it was just to talk. Me, I believed it, I'm terrible. He won't come back. I don't matter to you? Mister the judge. You are the policeman. Yes hello, I would like to talk to you about Zucchini, finally Emmanuel Larcher. I thought about it and I find it unfortunate that he leaves the Three Fountains. I can maybe... I have a son and they get along both very well. Maybe on a Sunday from time to time… The sea is very big. At least the swimming pool, we see the side. Damn ! - How did you manage? Are you stupid or what? - I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. Let me do. We calm down here. You didn't see what he did. - You can make an effort. Are you making an effort? Look, come see, I have a crab. He is huge. Here, put it in the bucket. Come on, let's get some water. He's very beautiful. Is an ice cream would make someone happy? We are going to go there. What are you doing ? - I'm leaving, can't you see it? Let go of me. And Raymond? - I leave it to you, are you happy? The kids who were there you don't know where they went? Stop following me. What do you want ? Why are you following me? We have to go back to the cafe, Raymond will pick us up. Leave me alone. Go away, you will end up getting lost. Go, go away! I warned you, this kid is a pain. You have to phone Raymond. - Leave me alone. Go, leave us alone. Leave us alone! Stop! Leave it! You, the farm or I'll pierce your skin. Stop! Let's go. Zucchini is not bad, just a little weird, that's all. He still killed his mother. - It was an accident. These accidents do not happen by chance. Thanks. Without you, I passed. you speak, it is the road that scared them. You are brave for a kid. Victor, your father, why don't you like it? Who told you that I didn't love her? - I think it's great. I had noticed it. Edouard Toulouse Hospital, 04 91 46 29 89. What happened ? We've been looking for you for four hours. I'll take you and you run away from me again? Victor had no never run away before you. Never, do you hear? You are hurt more, you fought, show. Call Croteil. - Yes. You say nothing, otherwise I go to the boarding house. Me then? - For you, it doesn't change anything. Hold this for me. Why did you leave ? Put that on your nose. I don't understand you anymore you were good with us. Say something. - Who steals an egg, steals an ox. It's you ? We doubt it. It's you what was all up to it? Yes. You will sleep there and tomorrow morning, I'll bring you back. It was just a few drinks, but sometimes that's enough to... I have not seen the car in front. I managed to avoid the frontal impact, but we rolled over. It never ended. Don't you remember anything? Then I found myself lying in a field. The car was returned on the roof in the middle of the road. I gone ahead. You were both stuck. Catherine shouted: "Help Victor, get Victor out!" I couldn't not to cut your belt. It lasted, lasted. After I have you deposited on the embankment. When I returned to help Catherine, I saw the oncoming truck. He honked like crazy. There was nothing left. Just a crushed carcass. I felt so guilty, I wanted everyone. Especially to me. You wanted me too? - No why ? I thought. Zucchini, Zucchini, it's time. We have to go there. Where is he ? - Who ? The kid. - I do not know. He escaped, it's a nightmare. Shit. Croteil is Raymond, give me Dugommier. Dad, wait. You don't have to blame him. It's my fault. - That's to say ? Yesterday, the runaway, it was I who wanted to leave. Zucchini got scared for me so he followed me. It's my fault. Do you want me? - It's good that you told me. There, you have to find it. Come on, try not to being late for high school. It's dangerous to play with a weapon. Hands up, raise your hands, you have to. It's not a game. I want to go very far and I will do what I want. I know about the runaway, Victor told me everything. I know it wasn't you you should have told me that. When I speak, nobody believes me. Me, I believe you. Every time I believe you give me the gun. We are going to get hurt. In any event, one day i will go to jail. So now or later... Why are you going to jail? It's your boyfriend who said it, when you steal an ox, you break an egg. It's not true. brave like you we can get out of it. Me, I trust you and you too, you must believe it. You don't need me anymore you are no longer angry with Victor. It's thanks to you. With you, I learned a lot of things. What ? - To laugh first. What now ? - To be less severe, to enjoy like you and also to be less afraid. Tomorrow, I will go to see the judge. - To do what ? Ask if you can come more often. I spoke to Victor about it, you have to agree. You agree ? Camille will be able to come sometimes? We'll see.
