Libertine, ruthless, insatiable. Casanova is, for everyone, the synonym of a playboy - gluttonous and unscrupulous. However, this was not actually Casanova. It's true that he was a great seducer, yet he was anything but perfunctory. It's true that he was a collector of adventures, but not only amorous ones. So then who was Giacomo Casanova, really? A relentless traveller. A diplomat. A religious man. A musician. A secret agent. A mathematician. An alchemist. An adventurer. But, above all, a writer. Casanova was a man of a thousand faces, a free man hungry for knowledge, willing to risk his life just to wear the many masks his era offered him. "I have always found delight in losing the right path. "I have constantly lived in the midst of error, "with no consolation but the knowledge that I was mistaken. "Therefore, dear reader, I hope that far from finding "in my history the character of impudence and arrogance, "you will find characteristics of a general confession." He left, at his death in 1798, an extraordinary document, the Histoire de ma vie, The History Of My Life, an attempt at an encyclopaedic answer to everything he could remember of a long life well lived. He wrote translations, he wrote little poems, he wrote plays, and he wrote a fantastic novel, a sort of 18th-century science-fiction, L'Icosameron. And yet those pages don't just contain his numerous love affairs but much, much more. Casanova was a very modern man in one particular regard - he never had one single career, it was a whole portfolio. He trains for the priesthood, he ends up a violinist, a soldier, a traveller, an attempted mathematician, a writer, an organiser of the state lottery in France, and ends up as a librarian in what was then known as Bohemia. A man of many faces, as many as are the masks of Venice. His city. One of the issues that came to intrigue me, partly because I'm an actor as well as an historian, is the issue of Giacomo Casanova and mask and masquerade, because the issue of the fashionability of Venice is key to understanding the 18th century, as well as to understanding Casanova. So on the one hand Venice is the place of inquisition, which means that it forbids you from reading certain books, anything that is too erotic or that is too enlightened. And so there is this severity in Venice. On the other hand, it is also the place of liberty. So we really have these two facets of Venice embodied in L'Histoire de ma vie. To have a mask is to be invisible, and therefore it means to be free. Because a mask in Venice is not just covering your eyes, it's covering your entire body. We don't know your name, we don't know your gender, we don't know who you are and you can behave with complete freedom. And that's what allows Casanova to go from one street to the next without ever being seen, jumping from one gondola to the other, to lose a spy, or somebody who has been following him - so it's really part of a big hide and seek game for the pleasure seekers and the free men and women of 18th-century Venice. "To be certain she could not recognise me, I donned a mask, "and without paying attention to the cold - since a dress made "of light calico is not particularly agreeable - I boarded a gondola." "I walked on, assuming the gait of a booby, the true characteristic "of my costume, and I entered the circle of dancers. "I stopped before a pretty girl dressed as a harlequin "and I took her hand in so awkward a manner to dance with me a minuet." Casanova's attraction for masks, indeed his aptitude in creating roles for himself, did seem to narrate his story from the very beginning. His mother, Zanetta Farussi, was an actress in an era when to be so implied a duality of career, and it is unclear quite who the fathers of his various siblings were. One possibility is that his natural father was of the Grimani family, one of the grand patrician families of Venice, involved in the ownership of the San Samuele Theatre. And certainly Casanova seemed to spend his life with this feeling that he was born to do greater things than was actually his lot as the son of a Venetian comedienne. In 1741, at the age of just 16, Casanova was conferred in minor ecclesiastical orders and achieved the title of abbe. This allowed him a sort of entry into Venetian society, but also led to his meeting Angela, the niece of the parish priest, and it was this encounter with Angela that began his travelogue through the pleasures, and indeed pain, of love. My love for Angela proved fatal to me because from it sprang two other love affairs which, in their turn, brought with them a great many others and forced me finally to renounce the church as a profession. While still a teenager, Casanova had been involved in numerous sexual encounters and love affairs. It was an adventurousness that would accompany him his entire life. If his apparently unbridled sexual activity was perhaps not a rarity for men of his era, it perhaps was for men who, like him, had chosen a vocation in the church. It was a role which lasted just long enough to entertain him, it might seem, whilst he was waiting for a finer role to play. "I still remember with pleasure that I was greatly appeased "when I was able to comfortably admire myself in a beautiful mirror. "I saw myself as superb and made to wear and honour the military "uniform I had chosen for a pleasant inspiration." By his early teen... late teens, early 20s, he's already been through the career of cleric, in effect, a professional gambler as he tried, soldier. Ended up as a violinist. You could argue Casanova was a man blessed or cursed by many talents. He is never able to quite settle at anything, it would seem, but also was able to turn his mind and his skills to many different careers. "Who was Henriette? "Who was the woman of whom I became master? "It seemed to me impossible to be the happy mortal who possessed her." It seems maybe the question why didn't Casanova ever marry begs more of us than it does of him. He was interested in another game of love. There is, in performance terms, not necessarily an expectation that a game of love will end necessarily in marriage. The game and the performance is what it's all about. That issue of falling in love with somebody else who was in masquerade, somebody else who was a performer, somebody who was obliged to be very alive always to the hidden and the shown, tells us something very fascinating, maybe, about Casanova and his interest also in the broken personalities of performers, in the business of hiding and showing, to the business of masquerade. MUSIC: Flower Duet by Leo Delibes None more important, maybe, or more instructive, I would argue, of the man, than a person who has come down to us under the pseudonym of Bellino. # Sur la rive en fleurs # Riant au matin # Viens, descendons ensemble... # Bellino, such was the name of the castrato. My libertine nature caused me to feel intense voluptuousness in believing him to be of that sex to which I wanted him to belong. And everything made me think of a beautiful woman rather than a boy. I became thoroughly enamoured. # Gagnons le bord # Ou la source dort # Et l'oiseau, l'oiseau chante... # Bellino was masquerading as a castrato. Masquerading because Bellino, in fact, was a woman. She may well have been Teresa Lanti or Landi, who went on to a very successful career as a soprano and whose portrait hangs in La Scala in Milan to this day. But when he/she met Giacomo Casanova, he/she was obliged to dress as a man in order to perform in the papal territories where women could not sing onstage. # Les cygnes aux ailes de neige # Allons cueillir les lotus bleus # Oui, pres des cygnes aux ailes de neige, # Allons cueillir les lotus bleus # Sous le dome epais # Sous le blanc jasmin # Viens, descendons # Dons # Ensemb... # Ensemble. # His movements, the expression of his face, his gait, his walk, his countenance, his voice, and above all, my own instinct told me that I could not possibly feel for a castrato what I felt for Bellino. When you read L'Histoire de Ma Vie, the reason why it is such, perhaps, the best book one can ever read, it's because you hear Casanova's voice, you hear him seducing you, trying to enthral you into his tale and you discover for yourself the talent of the storyteller. So really, reading L'Histoire de Ma Vie, it's like talking to the man. Rumours began to circulate about the unprecedented and strange social ascendancy of Giacomo Casanova. Word spread about his healing, with resort to mysterious arts. He began to win unexpectedly at cards. There were stories of his numerous affairs with some married women. And all this solicited the interest of the Venetian Inquisition - an all-powerful but secretive ministry, such as one might find in a modern police state. And it began to gather information about him. And eventually, in the July of 1755, Giacomo Casanova was arrested and taken to Il Piombi Prison. The word "tribunal" froze the blood in my heart and merely the faculty of passive obedience was left to me. I will spare the reader what the rage, indignation and despair made me say and think against the gruesome and despotic measure that had been taken towards me. One of the more shocking aspects of the story of Casanova's imprisonment in Il Piombi, The Leads, the prison of the Venetian Inquisition, under the roof of the Doge's Palace, is that Casanova didn't really know why he was there. The Inquisition had no need or pressure to actually explain to those who were arrested what they were arrested for, or indeed how long people were being incarcerated, or why. In the police report, what is the problem? It seems to be that it is what Casanova was reading, the fact that he was a man of the Enlightenment. When they arrested him, they came looking for his books, asking him if he was familiar with this or that work and mostly occult works, so things that you would call witchcraft. So Casanova was really interested in everything that was connected to science and therefore that also led him to explore a bit of alchemy and a lot of occultism. He had read a lot, all the books about how to...about the Philosopher's Stone, how to turn metal into gold, that type of thing. There was a craze for that in the 18th century. For a long time I have had in my possession a numerical Kab-Eli, through which I can arrive at an answer in Arabic numerals to any question that I put in the same numerals. But what's happened to him is that people would rush to him to get from him this comfort that he could tell them either where treasure was buried, how to get to know the future by interrogating his spirit, his angel spirit, or in the case of Madame d'Urfe, so he says that some mad woman - mad old woman he met in Paris - she was very much into that, she was completely into what we would call witchcraft. MUSIC: Minuetto by Luigi Boccherini She asked him to resuscitate her as a young baby boy. I was the possessor, in her estimation, not only of the Philosopher's Stone, but also of the power of speaking with the whole host of elementary spirits, from which premises she drew the very logical deduction that I could turn the world upside down if I liked. So Casanova really claims that he's not an impostor, he's not lying to people, he's giving them really in fact just what they want. He says, "I am not fooling them, they're fools already "and I'm just exploiting their weakness, "but not for my own benefit, rather for them "because it brings them a bit of happiness, a bit of hope." There is another reason as to why Casanova was sent to prison in Il Piombi, which might be the fact that he belonged to Freemasonry. So at the time, of course, everybody more or less powerful was potentially connected to a lodge, was a Masonic brother himself, and it is very possible that it is in fact personal, social rivalries that put Casanova in prison to get rid of him, put away from that society which he was trying to, on which he was trying to climb more and more and was doing so very successfully. A well-born young man who wishes to travel and know not only the world but also what is called good society, who does not want to find himself in certain cases inferior to his equals and excluded from participating in all their pleasures, must get himself initiated in what is called Freemasonry. Giacomo Casanova was sentenced, for his infractions, whatever they were, to solitary confinement and maybe to five years of a sentence. I began to study a thousand ways to carry through a venture that many had attempted before me but no-one had been able to complete. After having surmounted 15 or 16 plates, I found myself on the ridge of the roof, on which I sat astride, comfortably, spreading out my legs. My back was towards the little island of St George the Greater and about 200 paces in front of me were the numerous cupolas of St Mark's Church, which forms part of the Ducal Palace. He got onto the roof, realised that at full moon they might cast a shadow, waited for the moon to pass, or a cloud to pass over the moon, got back down into the palace, the Doge's Palace below. Avoiding the appearance of a fugitive, but walking fast, I went down the splendid stairs of the giant. I went straight towards the chief door of the palace and, looking at no-one so that no-one might notice me, I crossed the square, reached the dock and then entered the first gondola that I came across. Casanova's escape from The Leads was the turning point of his entire life. Venice repudiated him. He is, most of his life after that, in exile from Venice, but the rest of Europe, the courts of Europe in particular, embrace him and allow him to reinvent himself. This, um, story, the Histoire de Ma Fuite, as it later became known when it was finally published, was Casanova's only claim to fame, really, in his own lifetime. Literary fame eventually, because it was a minor bestseller, when eventually published. Giacomo Casanova had a preposterous and wonderful picaresque adventure throughout all of the then known world as a result of being exiled, in effect, from Venice. Another fascinating aspect of L'Histoire de Ma Vie are what amounts to celebrity pen sketches. The great and the good of his era that Casanova met, from Catherine the Great to Frederick the Great, Voltaire, Rousseau, Crebillon, Samuel Johnson, Benjamin Franklin. Across Europe of this era, he seemed to be bumping into everybody in some Zelig or Forrest Gump sort of manner. How is this possible? When Casanova walks into a room, already, you cannot miss him. He's very tall, he's dark - he has an aura. When he walks into a room, you can't miss it. But more than that, what he has is a real... the talent of a showman. And he has... Which... Which means that when you talk to him, he entertains you - he seduces you. He wanted to achieve the financial and social prestige and ascendancy that had been denied him in Venice. HE SPEAKS FRENCH "For my demonstration, just half an hour was required. "The substance was that the lottery would have been perfectly equal "in relation to payment of the winning ticket "if instead of five numbers, six were extracted. "Yet, since five would be extracted, "this offered assurance that there would always be a profit of 20%." In 1757, the French government embraced Casanova's ideas and instituted a national lottery which he himself would promote. It again demonstrates his extraordinary ingenuity, inventiveness, and for that matter his intellectual skill, in particular, in mathematics. And he published a series of articles on the subject, including, for instance, a number of essays on the issue of the doubling of the volume of a cube - an issue that had excited the interest of mathematicians since antiquity. "And not knowing the rules that arithmetic prescribed for those "who want to calculate to provide certainties on all "degrees of measure, I doubled the cube numerically, "significantly, practically, as was desired, "and that had been sought in vain for 2,000 years." Priest, soldier, adventurer, alchemist, businessman, mathematician. In order to gain social ascendancy and enter the social circles to which he aspired, Casanova turned to a whole dressing-up box of masks. His role as adventurer was the gift that kept on giving. In 1766, he defied death in a pistol duel and this became the inspiration for a minor, if celebrated, literary success. "Nothing more was said. "With their weapons lowered, looking each other in the face, "both slowly retreated ten paces. "The Venetian, who had already raised his pistol but kept its "muzzle pointing to the ground, "turned sideways as if they were to fight with swords." MAN SPEAKS FRENCH It was 1774 and Giacomo Casanova finally received a pardon from the Venetian Inquisition. After 18 years of exile, Venice was again open to him. MAN SPEAKS ITALIAN "I was then 49 and I expected no more of fortune's gifts, "for the deity despises those of a ripe age. "I thought, however, "that I might live comfortably and independently in Venice. "I had hoped to count on myself drawing on my abilities." The charges against him were annulled. However, and perhaps ironically, he went into service for his former persecutors, the Venetian Inquisition, and donned another mask as secret agent. MAN SPEAKS ITALIAN SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN HE SPEAKS ITALIAN WOMAN SPEAKS ITALIAN HE SPEAKS FRENCH HE SPEAKS ITALIAN "The Protocosmos is a convex world, and it is inhabited by "extraordinary small creatures, the Megamicres, "great and spirit and small in stature, "on whose foreheads a cartilage forms a sort of visor. "In their world, the air is completely different from in ours, "and there is only one season. "Night does not exist. "The Megamicres do not sleep "and their regime of living never varies." HE SPEAKS ITALIAN HE SPEAKS FRENCH SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN MAN SPEAKS ITALIAN FIREWORKS EXPLODE MAN SPEAKS FRENCH HE SPEAKS ITALIAN HE SPEAKS FRENCH CARRIAGE RUMBLES In 1783, only nine years after his return to Venice, Giacomo Casanova was again forced into exile. "Or I am not made for Venice, I say, or Venice is not for me. "Or one or the other together. "I have lived 58 years. "I cannot go on foot with winter at hand and when I think of "starting on the road to resume my adventurous life, "I laugh at myself in the mirror." SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN So far from Venice and having travelled so widely, Casanova was forced, for the first time, to stop completely. WOMAN SPEAKS ITALIAN HE SPEAKS ITALIAN "I write," he wrote, "otherwise I would be dead." And in the silence of the countryside, and indeed partly as a cure for his melancholia, he began obsessively writing. HE SPEAKS ITALIAN And as a result of that, we have the extraordinary document that is the "Histoire de ma vie". "I have written the history of my life and no-one can find fault "with it, yet am I wise in throwing it before a public? "I am aware it is sheer folly, but I want to keep myself busy. "I want to laugh, so why should I deny myself gratification?" And maybe that's why that is his most successful work, because it was not something that he tried to fake in order to please an audience, or in order to sell books. This is actually his voice that we hear. It is him, himself, who he was, speaking through the book. HE SPEAKS ITALIAN MUSIC: Serenade For Strings Op 22 by Antonin Dvorak We see that he tries to preserve suspense or mystery. He really builds it as if it were an adventure he did not know, erm, he did not know....of which he did not know the next episode. And this sort of liberty and invitation to the reader to participate to the creation of the final product of the book, is very modern. "The reader would discover in these memoirs that, in life, "I have never had a fixed aim before my eyes, "and that my system, if it can be called a system, "has been to let myself be carried away, "trusting to the wind where it led." MAN SPEAKS FRENCH HE SPEAKS ITALIAN Casanova died in 1798 at the age of 73, in the castle in Dux, or Duchcov, in Bohemia, where he had spent the last 15 years of his life obsessively writing the "Histoire de ma vie" - the "History Of My Life". "Death is a monster that turns away from the great theatre an attentive "spectator, before the end of a play which deeply interests him." When we read the memoirs we see, maybe, a way to forget about this looming death. The memoirs are achieving eternity - we can see that that may be Casanova's little victory over death. So, he is not eternal, alchemy and the philosopher's stone has not achieved that, but "l'Histoire de ma vie" definitely has. That is the thing that has allowed Casanova to transgress the last limit, which was the limit of his human finitude. Subtitles by Ericsson
