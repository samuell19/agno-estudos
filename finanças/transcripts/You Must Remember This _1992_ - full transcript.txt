That's cold. - Hey Alphonso. - How you doing, Mrs. J? - So? - So, Mr. J, Ella and I are going to the movies. - Ella, Alphonso's here. - Uncle Buddy, come on, we're gonna be late. Mom, I finished the dishes. - Please put a jacket on over that skimpy dress. - Amen. - Okay. - What are you looking at? - You've got a piece of spinach between your teeth. - I do? - Psyche! - Bye, mister and miss J. You're dead! - Anybody see a streak of greased lightning run through here? Might've resembled a girl in pigtails. - We did. And thanks. - Okay. (upbeat music) - Hey. - Your seat, madam. Would you like something to drink? Some (mumbling)? - Oh Hubie. - It's hors d'oeuvres, Hubie. (laughing) - Yo Hubie. You gotta see this flick, man. - What flick is that, Phonso? - Cowboys ride the plains in the wild west. - Yeah, they should make more movies like that only with black cowboys. - Well you know, I saw Danny Glover play a cowboy once. He was bad. - Uncle Buddy, why don't they make more movies like that? - Well, maybe someday somebody will. Maybe even somebody I'm talking to at this very moment. - Yeah, I could see it now. Ella Jackson presents an Ella Jackson film written, produced, and directed by Ella Jackson. - I'll be the first in line to buy tickets. - Check this out, Mr. J. If I made a movie about buffalo soldiers and Indians, I'll call it Boys In The Reservation. (laughing) - If you ever make a movie, I hope you let someone else choose the title. - What do you say, Buddy? - I'm fine, Janet, you? - You're in good company tonight. - Not too shabby, not too shabby. - You gonna win that championship, Ella? - You know that. - That's what I like to hear. So what are you having? - Why don't we get some of your famous peach cobbler a la mode? - And I'll have one too. - All right. - I don't want anything. - What? - I'm not hungry. - You're a teenage boy, you're always hungry. That's what you do best, eat. - Make his a double peach cobbler a la mode. - Yeah. - Mr. J, you always doing stuff for me and I never get a chance to do anything for you. - Well, friends can do things for friends without expecting payback. - But you bought a popcorn at the movies and the snacks after the movies. When do I get to be your friend? - Every time we hang out together. If you weren't my friend, would we hang out so much together? - Well, no. - I rest my case. But if you really wanna do something special for me-- - Name it, Mr. J, just name it. - Take Hubie's advice, let someone else choose the titles of your films. (laughing) - Come on, teamwork. Pass the ball, Ella. (crowd cheering) - Face baby dance. - Face baby dance, is that one of those authentic basketball sayings. - Ella, pass it. Over here, pass it, Ella. Ella, Ella. Pass the ball. (crowd cheering) - I was open. - Move, Cindy, I didn't see you, okay. - Yeah, right. (crowd cheering) - That was a real close game. Very close, but we won. (applause) If we want that championship, we're gonna have to do it one more time, two weeks from today. So, what are we gonna do while we're waiting. We gotta practice hard. - [Team] Yes. - You're gotta (indistinct) hard. - [Team] Yes. - Do you want this championship? - [Team] Yes. - I can't hear you, do you want the championship? - [Team] Yes, - All right, see you in practice. There will be no excuses, Tamara. - Oh, coach, I really did have to get my braces tightened, see. - Close your mouth girl, the reflection is killing me. (laughter) - [Coach] All right, see you guys in practice. Ella, great game, great game. 27 points and every one of them counts. - Thanks coach. - Great shot at being the summer league top scorer. - Yeah, now that the blazers are out of it, Miller can't score any more points. - But Ella, that's not our primary objective. We want the team to be summer champs. This is a team, Ella. - But coach... - No buts, we live or die as a team, okay. - Yes, coach. - Ella, Ella. - Daddy, daddy. - 27 points closer to that score and trophy. - 27 points closer to the summer league special scholarship. - All right. Another 19 points and you are the summer league scoring champion. I thought you should name this girl Magic. - Magic Jackson, I like that. I gotta go tell uncle Buddy. Bye. - Ella. - Yeah, mom. Thanks, bye. - I need to hit the books. Wow, it is late. - Well, why don't I make dinner. - I really would appreciate that. - Yeah? How much? - A lot. - Mister and Mrs. Jackson, just turn the lights out when you leave. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, that Alphonso is so cute. - Tara, now I know what's wrong with your game. - What's that? - You're blind. - Hi Ella, great game. - Thanks. - Hi, Alphonso. - There she is, Ella, the gun Jackson. The girl who never met a shot she didn't take. - Alphonso, what is it? - I wanna know one thing, which is bigger. The basketball or your head. Your head wins again. - The biggest thing around here is your mouth. - So, I bet you go on to uncle Buddy to brag about them 27 point, huh. - Well, he's not your uncle. - Well, he's not your uncle either, he's your daddy's uncle. So there. - I'm not gonna hit you. - Yeah, right. - Really, I promise. - You swear? - I swear. In the words of the terminator asta la vista, sucker. - It's asta la vista baby.

That's 'cause you can't do it. - How are you doing, Alphonso. - Yo, Mr. J, you know me. Just trying to do the right thing. - Doing the right thing, that's fresh out there. - Somebody's been watching too much yo MTV raps. (laughter) - Ella, I can't take the suspense, did you win? - Yeah. - Bad game? - Yeah, I scored 27 points. - Oh, you little devil you. This girl's gonna win a trophy for best shooter and an Oscar for being a faker. - Yo, Mr. J, speaking of Oscars, we all gonna go to movie tonight? - Yeah, uncle Buddy. - We've already seen all the new releases. - But we haven't seen 'I dismember momma' part two. No one's allowed under 17 without a parent or guardian. And a barf bag. (laughter) - No, I don't think so. - I can do with that. - 'Cause I just remembered, down at the Baldwin they're showing some oldies. And tonight they got a real goodie. 'Back in the preacher' a western. - Oh, can't miss that one. You know how he loves them shoot them ups. - No, but this isn't just any western, this is a black western. - Yeah, like the stories you used to tell Alphonso and me. About the Criole Kid, the top 10 Texas, the team tombstone, the toughest hombre, west of the Pekos. - North of Rio Grand. - South of little big horn. - The East of, East of... - East of death valley. - Yeah. - Well, this western is really special. And Sydney Pwadyer directed it. - That means he's in charge. - Yes, he was in charge. But he's also acting, right alongside Harry Belofonte and he was just brilliant. He plays this cavalry soldier. - No, don't tell, uncle Buddy, don't tell. - All right, all right. Just remember who told you it was brilliant. - Buddy, excuse me, I just wanna know one thing. Who died and left you cisco and ebrich. - Yo, Mr. J, we're on. I'll see you two after dinner. I gotta go home, so I'm gone with the breeze. - It's wind, I'm gone with the wind. - I knew that, I was just testing you to see if you were still on your toes. Now, I'm finna fade out of here. Fade out of here, that was a good one, wasn't it. - Okay, there you go, Thaddeus. - It's about time. - Listen, I did a little something special for you here in the back. I saw it on Yo MTV rap. I shaved in your initial, a big T. (laughter) - Oh, man. - Well? - Well, what? - A man slays over a hot stove to make dinner for his family and this is all the thanks he gets. - Daddy, this chicken's great. - Yeah, these dumplings make me proud to call you nephew. - Everybody thinks the only reason I married you is 'cause you're so good looking. - Yeah, well, when you get that law degree, I may just quit my job, stay home and just cook plenty of this little good home cooking so you can keep your strength up. Go out there, make that big money. - What if I decide to become a public interest lawyer. They hardly make any money. - In that case, I'll keep my job and we'll start clipping those coupons for the Kernel. - Don't worry, Daddy. When I become the first woman in the NBA, I'm gonna take care of everybody. - Uncle Buddy, you should have seen her today. - Yeah, uncle Buddy, that ball had eyes. - That's my girl. - She was great. That's why I was wondering, what was going on between you and coach Dawson after the game? - That was no big thing. - I was concerned, you looked upset. - Honey, what are you talking about? - I thought I heard coach Dawson say the team lives or dies as a team. - Yeah, well, she should have said the team lives or dies by your jump shot. Thank you very much. - Honey, do you think she was being critical of you? - Mom, she wasn't being critical and why would you bring it up? - It seemed to me she wanted to help you. - If coach Dawson wants to help, she can start by recognizing pure genius when is right in her face. No, wait a minute, is it helpful to give the top shooter the blues for being the top shooter. How is that helping. Seems to me she stopped being so helpful. - Can I go to my room, I'm really tired. - Of course you are. - All right, but you still have to clear the table and wash the dishes. - Fine. - Maybe I'm the one who should stop trying to be so helpful. - It's not you, it's that silly coach, that's who upset her. - Excuse me. (knocks on the door) - Who is it? - I want to be alone. - Uncle Buddy. - Uncle Buddy, I'm supposed to be (distorted sound) I thought you could use some company. - Thanks. - I wish I could have seen that game. - You would have bee there if you could have. You always are. Besides, I felt you cheering me all the way from the barber shop. - I was, I was. It's great to know you understand. You know, I've always liked that Magic Johnson. Got that smile, like being a star was the easiest thing in the world. You know better - I guess I'm not Magic Jackson after all. - Yes, you are. But magic is just one part of it. Hard work, teamwork. That's the other part. - But what am I supposed to do. Why shouldn't I take the shot if I know I can make it. - Ella. - Okay, I know that being a hotdog isn't a good thing, but how do I know when it's the right time to pass off or when it's the right time to shoot? - Ella, you've got a good heart, you want to do the right thing. I trust you to find your own way. - Suppose I don't. - You will. - You think I could find my way and still be summer league scoring champ? (laughter) (foreign language) - Alphonso, you wanna die? - The shot was all false, just try to knock it in for you. What are you looking for? - I found your little pea brain. Let me knock that in for you. - Best be prepared to (indistinct) - Excuse me. Excuse me, is there Buddy Jackson at this address? - Yeah. - Don't bump the walls. Put it over here. - Say bye I heard some white wild (indistinct) - Thank you. - Sign it right here, please. - Absolutely. - Who did this thing come from Indiana Jones or something. - Thanks. - Mom, it's from Ella Du Champ. - Ella Du Champs. - What if it's from the Ellen Du Champs. - That really would be exciting, but it probably isn't from her. - Why not? - Honey don't you think uncle Buddy would have mentioned knowing the Ella Du Champs. - Hmm, mom you're gonna make a great lawyer. - Yo excuse me but who is the Ella Du Champs. - He doesn't know anything. It's so pathetic. - Ella Du Champs was a famous black movie actress in the 40s. Ella. - Oh it's just a paper mom. Uncle Buddy said she's the most beautiful woman in the world and I was named after her. Actually you were named after Ella Du Champs and Ella Fitzgerald. See uncle buddy was a big fan of Ella Du Champs and your dad was a big fan of Ella Fitzgerald and we had this beautiful baby girl with a big set of pipes. Alphonso I tell you when this girl started wailing, we thought she was gonna break every glass in the house. - Well, this girl is still loud. but I guess she was much better looking as a baby huh. - Ha-ha-ha, that's so funny. - Ella what are you doing? - Oh I was just making a face at Alphonso. - What are you doing with your hands. - Oh with my hands I just wanted to see what was in the trunk, you know. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't from the Ella Du Champs. - Do you see the name Ella Jackson anywhere. - Uh-oh, somebody got snack. - But mom, uncle Buddy won't mind. - I mind. - Oh please. Okay, okay I'll leave it alone. Come on Alphonso, let's go and shoot some jumpers. - You never give up this easy. - Who said anything about giving up. Uncle buddy will let me open it. Come on. - That's nice. - Thank you very much, sir. You have a good day. - Thanks. - Thaddeus, if you're still alive, could you signal by moving one of your checkers. Can I give you a hint, this is not brain surgery man, it's checkers, move. - You heard that old saying, you study long you study wrong. - There's no point in rushing, Thaddeus. The more you rushing, the slower he goes. - But I believe that ice moved faster than him. - Couldn't move no slower. - Hallelujah. - Guess what uncle Buddy, you just got a trunk. - I do, where. - Good one, Mr. J - Uncle Buddy, come on. It just got delivered to the house and I told mom that you'd say it's okay for me to open it, but she's in one of those everything by the book moon. So I need for you to say it's okay, okay. - Slow down, I got a trunk? From who? - I can't believe I forgot the best part, is from Ella Du Champs. - [Man] Aint there an actress by that name. - You really must be getting old to forget a woman like that. They used to call her the colored Vivian Lee. But for my money, if they'd ever been in the picture together, by the end of it, people would have been saying Vivian who. - Well what's Buddy doing, getting a trunk from an actress? - Well we're not sure that it's from her yet, but I can't wait to find out. - Come on. - No. - What? - I don't have to explain myself to you, young lady. - And then Ella said he just went off on everybody. - You know how Ella exaggerates. It doesn't sound like uncle Buddy. - And taking no for an answer doesn't sound like Ella. I wonder why he doesn't want it opened. Maybe it is from Ella Du Champs and maybe uncle Buddy was the hairdresser on one of her movies and they had this mad passionate love affair and then she dropped him and broke his heart. - If she broke his heart, how come he wanted us to name our daughter after her. - You know, you can be very annoying when you're being logical. - Thank you. (soft music) - Hopefully he will have calmed down by the time he gets home because I am dying to ask him about her. Oh hi uncle Buddy. - Linda. Uh Joe, I can't lift that trunk. Could you get rid of it for me. - Without opening it? - Yes, without opening it. - Well, aren't you curious about what's in it? - No I'm not and I don't wanna be cross-examined about it either. Joe just get rid of the trunk, okay. Can a man get any privacy in his own house. - Uh, uncle buddy, we're gonna have dinner soon as Ella gets home from the library. - I won't be eating this evening. - I don't know what he's so upset about. If I got a trunk from Denzel Washington, I wouldn't be going around telling everyone not to cross-examine me in my own house. - Why would you get a trunk from Denzel Washington. - None of your business. - Uncle Buddy. - Come in. - I heard the music, are you okay. - Just feeling a little blue. - No, Uncle Buddy, you don't have the blues. - Everybody can have the blues every now and then. - But that means you're sad or you're hurt. - No, I just think I'm a little tired, been overworking. I'm not as young as I used to be. - Could I read to you? You always read to me when I'm tired. - That's mighty kind of you, Ella, but I think I just wanna let my brain go empty. - I could help you beat the blues. - No, thank you for caring. I'll see you in the morning. Probably by then, blues will be all washed away. - Okay, good night then. - Night too. - Okay ladies, I want you to take a second and look around. Go ahead look. Seems the same, doesn't it. Same old faces in the same old gym with the same old coach. Well it's not. This is the first time that we've all been together in this gym to practice for the league championship. This is all new. Are we excited about this? - [Team] Yes. - Are we excited about this? - [Team] Yes. - All right. (whistle blows) Hey. Great. Real good. Cindy, that pass was right to you. - I'm sorry coach, I was in shock. - 30 laps. - You play like you're in shock. - Ella, get back in line. Hey, 50 laps. All right. Oh. - Uncle Buddy. (slow music) - [Voice Over] My dear Buddy, if you are reading this then I am gone. Don't think of me as old and sick, remember me the way we were when we were young and full of dreams. I leave you my treasure, what remains of all that we were, all that you were. May it finally mean as much to you as it has always meant to me. Love, Ella. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You mean to tell me that you went into Mr. J's room, took out his letter and then read it. I don't believe this, I really don't believe this. What'd it say? - It said something about her leaving him a treasure. - A treasure. We rich, we rich. Okay you gonna be rich, I'm not gonna be rich. All right, you're gonna be rich. - Alphonso, I don't want you to strain yourself here, but try and think if it was that kind of treasure, why would uncle Buddy wanna get rid of it. - Well maybe uncle Buddy don't know what's in there. - If he doesn't know what's in there, why is he so upset? - Is there smoke coming out my ears yet? - Alphonso, we've got to open that trunk. - Okay look, now what I want you to do is when you get to your spot, I want you to fake your opponent like you're going around, pull back, go up and angle your shot. Okay, now your turn. Now, remember you gotta get your arc on the shot. That's what makes it good. Fake, shoot. Ella if we're gonna win this scoring trophy, you're gonna have to get more fade in that fadeaway. Now get the ball. - Ella, Ella. - Ms. Space cadet, let's go. - Ella girl, you need to get a grip on yourself. - [Man On TV] She's chosen curtain number three. Lana, show our viewers what's behind curtain number three. (instrumental music) - Alphonso, you gotta come over, right away. Okay. (laughter) - It's a snake. - I think it's dead. - I knew that. - Wow, what is all this stuff. - What kind of treasure is this supposed to be. Just a bunch of old BT stuff. - BT stuff. - Yeah BT, you know like before television. Action. - Alphonso, this must be from the Ella Du Champs. - How do you know that? - This is a film can. Who else would have a trunk full of film cans. - Wait, it's the movie about the creole can. - The creole can, but I thought he made that up. - I don't get it. Make my day. - Alphonso, I think this is uncle Buddy. - It is uncle Buddy, with a serious babe. - Check this out. Wow it's just like the same one that woman's wearing in the picture. Wow. (laughter) It's Mr J and the Duke, the Duke. - That's John Wayne. - Mr. J used to be in the movies. - No Alphonso, he made movies with Ella Du Champs. Uncle buddy was W.B Jackson. Uncle Buddy was a director. - Why he used to be Spike Lee. - This is so incredible. People could go into the tower theater and see a movie that my uncle Buddy made. - Well that explains why he knows so much about the movies. Yo, Ella, if Mr J used to be Spike Lee, why don't he tell anybody? I mean, Spike Lee always tell everybody, "Hey, I'm Spike Lee", and people already know who he is. - Yeah, why is this stuff such a big secret? - Uh-oh. Hurry up. The hat. - Get out, just get out. Get out of here. (slow music) - So then the lights go back on and the money is gone. Who took it, the cheap lawyer, the expensive lawyer or the tooth fairy. - The cheap lawyer. - No, the expensive lawyer. The cheap lawyer and the tooth fairy are figments of your imagination. Isn't that a good lawyer joke? I figure going to law school doesn't mean I have to lose my sense of humor. I think it's not good to let your studies take over all your life. I bet you never thought you'd hear me say that, huh Ella. - Should I bring up what happened today? - I think you've waited long enough. - Guess where I was today. - Where. - Paramount Studios. - Isn't that exciting. - Yeah, I was sent over to fix a computer, it wasn't anybody important, just some executive. And while I was there, I kept thinking how you two film buffs would enjoy being on a real movie lot. - Tell them who you saw. - Oh yeah yeah, Mr. Spark. The guy from the "Star Trek" movies, the one with the ears. He had on the ears too, I mean it was makeup of course, but there he was and there I was walking side by side. - Isn't that great. - Yeah. - Now the best part about this was that they have these buildings over there named after important Hollywood people. They have the Cecil B. DeMille building, they had a Lucille Ball building and I saw the place where Eddie Murphy has his production offices. Way to go Eddie, huh. - Is everything all right with you two? - Fine. - Great. - I think I'll take my evening walk. - Are you sure everything's all right? - Yeah everything's cool, mom. I'm just gonna go do the dishes now. - Was that our daughter volunteering to do the dishes? - I don't know whether I should be happy or go get a thermometer. ♪ You must remember this ♪ ♪ A kiss is still a kiss ♪ ♪ As time goes by ♪ - At least you're still in one piece. - Well nothing happened. I mean something happened but nothing really happened. - Wait, wait, I'm missing something. - Uncle Buddy didn't say anything to my parents. - Wow. - Yeah but he's really mad at me. Trust me, I can tell. - [Mrs. Jackson] Ella. - Yeah mom, I'm on the porch. - Honey, uncle Buddy forgot his lunch. Would you drop it by the barbershop? - Mom, I've got basketball practice in an hour. - Then you have plenty of time. Now here, I'm leaving this in your capable but currently idle hands. - Yes ma'am. Alphonso, the barbershop's the last place I wanna go. - Ella, you and Mr. J are tight. I mean, how bad could it be. - [Commentator] Through four and a half minutes of play, the Dodgers lead the Pittsburgh Pirates three to one. Okay, here we go. - Would you two hold it down, I'm trying to hear my ball game. - [Commentator] Heading for the Dodgers. And the first Pittsburgh drawback is hit hard to the right side. - Well, hello Ella. - Hi. - Hi, cousin. - Hi Ella. - Hi uncle Buddy. Uncle Buddy, I brought you your lunch. Just put it over the counter, please. Thank you. - You're right, this is pretty bad. - Why is he treating me like this, all I did was open his stupid trunk. - Yeah, he's definitely overreacting. Ella, what are you looking at? - Nothing. - You're crying. - No, I'm not. - All right, I'm sorry, it's my mistake. - Is that all you can do is just joke all the time. - Hey I'm sorry really, don't cry about it. - I can't help it. I feel like I hurt him and I don't know why or how to fix it or anything. - Well maybe you're not the one that he's really mad at. - Yeah, right. - I mean think about it, everything was fine until this trunk came, right. And all you really did was find out that he used to make films. - Yeah, but why is he so angry about that. - It's not like it's some deep dark secret and he's gonna end up on America's most wanted or something. - That's how he's acting. - Yeah, we just gotta figure out why. - How are we supposed to do that? - Why, why, why do I got to come up with everything. - Oh, great. You know what I wish though, I wish we could find somebody who knew him, back when he was making movies. - There was a poster with Ella Du Champs on it. And it was the name of a theater on it. - It was a Tower Theater in Los Angeles. - Yeah, it's over on Broadway and they still show her films there. - Are you think you and I'm thinking. - Yo, it's worth a shot. - Meet me here after practice, okay. - Hey, got you covered. - Alphonso, this is a brilliant plan. - Hey, I knew that. - I don't know this doesn't look right to me. - How do you know that's supposed to look like when you've never been here before. - Are you sure you took the right bus. - Look, Fo knows buses to go visit my aunt. I once took the bus all the way to Bakersfield by myself. - Well if we're lost, you're gonna wish you stayed in Bakersfield by yourself. - See, that's (indistinct) (speaking foreign language) - Well, way to go Fo. (speaking foreign language) - Don't tell me, he flunked Spanish I. - And barely squeaked by in English. - That's real funny, Ella. - Listen, can you help us, we're trying to get some information. Have you ever heard of a film called 'Two Gun Lily' from Lenox Avenue. - Sorry Senorita. - Well, have you ever heard of a black director named W.B Jackson. - Are you sure you have the right place? - Yeah, he had a film that showed here a long time ago. - Before you people were here. - We people have been in California for 500 years. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what I meant. I'm talking about before when this was a black theater, you know before it was a Spanish theater. - Maybe there is someone here that can help you. - Boss, these (foreign language) wanna ask you a couple questions. - What? - These ninos wanna ask you a couple of questions. - Come in. - Hi. - What's on your mind? - Have you ever heard of a film called 'Two gun Lily' from Lenox Avenue. - Heard of, I used to show it. - Then you know who W.B Jackson is. - W.B Jackson, I haven't heard that name in years. - He's her uncle. - So you are W.B Jackson's niece. - Yeah, did you know him? - No, but I sure admired his work. I used to show his films back in the old days. - Back when this was a black theater, huh. - Back when this was a white theater. You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? See, six days out of the week, this theater showed white Hollywood films. But on Tuesday nights, they used to run the race films. They were films made by colored folks with the colored casts. We were colored back then. Tuesday night was colored night. - Wait a minute, you mean to tell me that black, I mean color filmmakers only got a chance to show their films once a week? - Sometimes not even that much, son. Remember, those times were even harder for our people than today. If a colored filmmaker even got a chance to show his film at all, he was doing real good. Whenever we showed a W.D Jackson film, the house was full. Colored people from all over the city would be in there to see him. - Wow, his movies must have been really good. - He was one of the best. And in my line of work, you know. Of course, his films always had Ella Du Champs in them. And she was so enough easy on the eyes, yes indeed. You know she was even in some of those Hollywood films, but all she ever got to play was maids. - But why Gus, if she was such a good actress, then why. - Ella Du Champs was a gorgeous, intelligent, and talented woman. If they'd let her play what she was instead of just maids, they'd have had to look not just at her but all other colored women in an entirely different light and colored men too. Hollywood had a chance to put an end to prejudice, they just weren't brave or smart enough to take it. Hey this looks like my uncle Buddy's car. - Hey Mr. J's car is a 54 Studebaker, this is a 49 Ford. - Finest ever built. - Yeah girl, don't you know anything? - Mr. Gus, do you have any idea why my uncle Buddy stopped making films? - Believe me, it's no picnic to be colored and have dreams. I never met your uncle, but I know from all the work I've seen that W.B Jackson put an awful lot of heart into every one of his films. Takes a mighty big hurt to kill a heart that strong. - Mr. Gus, see there's this trunk. - Speak up, I can't hear you. - We've got a copy of "The Creole Kid". - You do? Well have you seen it? - No, but do you think that there's anything in there that could help my uncle Buddy? - You mean you've been asking me all these questions and you got the film and you haven't seen it? What's the matter with you kids. - Mr. Gus, we need someone to show it. - What do I look like to you, a race car driver. - But we do. Well we do. Listen, what good is it gonna do your uncle if it just stays in the trunk. If you want to he can drop the whole thing right now, I don't care. But if you really wanna help him. - I know, I know, I just hate it when you're right. - Since you brought the film, I figured I shouldn't show up empty-handed. Here's a little something that might interest you, my scrapbook. Now this is Clarence Muse. He used to act in race films and Hollywood films. And he had his own dude rants down near Lake Paris where all the black celebrities used to go. Folks like Joe Lewis. You know who I'm talking about, don't you? The brown bomber, the heavyweight champion of the world. - Oh, I knew that. - That's Hattie McDaniel. - You know who she is. - She's only the first black actress ever to win an Oscar. "Gone with the wind", 1939 and there have only been four more black actors to win ever since then. - See, we know a lot of things. - Hattie was such a good actress. She brought such bearing, such dignity to those parts that folks left the theater talking about the maid, not the mistress. Of course there were some white folks who felt she was too familiar with her employers, too uppity, that was their word for her. Oh, listen to me rattling on like we don't have a movie to see. Okay it's show time. - Yeah, "The Creole Kid". Reel one. - Did you kids put the tape on this can? - No. - Do you have any idea when whoever did it, did it? - No, why, is there something wrong? - If it's old nitrate film, which is what I think it is, you got a problem. Nitrate film deteriorates. You may have a movie in here or you may have a can of mush. - Great. - Well, can you open it so that we can find out? - As long as this can stay sealed up, you're fine. But opening this up is a job for experts. You better talk to my friend at the American Film Institute. (knocks on door) - Come in. - Hello, we're looking for Ricky Sewell. - Yeah, well you can stop looking. Ooh do you smoke? - Say what? - It's bad for you and it's really bad for the film. Nitrate film stock, very volatile. Gets near the flame and all you've got left is a bunch of stinking smoke and some funky old ashes. - Excuse me but didn't Gus Middleton, the projectionist call you? - Oh, you're the kids with the W.B Jackson film. Well, why didn't you say so. Come on. Well if she did a good job of taping the can, which she obviously did and kept it in a cool place like a basement, it could easily last for 50 years. - And if she didn't. - Well let's just hope she knew what she was doing, okay. All right ready? - Yes. - Let's do it. Oh something smell like rotten eggs. - A little sulfur smell is normal, yeah. Ooh, it's not sticky, it's nice and dry. - Well, what does that mean? - That means that Ella Du Champs was as clever as she was beautiful. - [All] Oh all right. - Now we can take a look at the film. - Oh no, not yet. It needs to be sent to the lab at UCLA to soak in renovx for three days, then we can run it just once through the flatbed and then we gotta get this baby preserved. - Three days? - Yeah. - I don't know how we're gonna last that long with this whole mystery on my mind 24/7. know what I mean. (instrumental music) - I just have to see this opening one more time. What a brilliant opening sequence. - Seen that plenty of times. - Yes now. But a tracking shot with a running horse had rarely been done in race films and he did it looking up at the rider. - Yeah, you know right away that the creole kid is the hero. - That's right, just like your uncle. - Do you really think that my uncle Buddy's a hero. - I do, I absolutely do. And you want me to show you why. This was my student film project when I first came here. It's called the Hollywood hall of shame. This is how Hollywood portrayed black Americans in the 1930s. That's Ben Crosby in blackface. - Hey, you're late, stupid. - Oh me? - Yes, right through that door, stage three. Yeah hurry up. - Hey, what's the idea, you're late. - But, boy I'm lucky to be here at all. - Samson, get up or you gonna be late for your afternoon nap. - Now this is an Ethel Waters movie. My goodness, maybe he's dead. - Yeah from the neck up. This will get it, lunch is served. - Did I hear y'all say something about lunch. - You sure did but just make believe I was fooling 'cause you ain't get none know how. - Well I ain't did nothing. - As jazz did. - No kid it'd be no clowns snatching back and stuffing sounds from the job, put it down oh can't leave it later. Bring it down, (indistinct) - That's Steppen Fetchet. - Is that his real name. - Lincoln Perry's his real name but he did lots of Hollywood films as Steppen Fetchet. This is him again. - What's your name. - I was baptized David Begets Solomon. - David Begets what? - David begets Solomon about saying George Lincoln Watson. - Well now listen, if you're going with me, we're gonna stick right to the bible, you're a Jonah. - Oh, I am... - [Ella] That's Shirley Temple. - [Alphonso] And Hattie McDaniel. - [Rickie] Yes, and Bill Bojangles Robinson. - You aint got no money. M-O-N-I-E. - Not only that, we most out of F-U-D-E. - They can't even spell. - That's too bad, look here. Wouldn't they K-U-N-E-L give a little L-O-N-E. - You know miss Elizabeth wouldn't take nothing from him. Why before she'd do that, she'd go to the P-O-H-O-S. - P-O-H-O-S. - Yeah sure, ain't you got no education. Poor house. - Now compare that image to this one. - [Alphonso] That Creole kid was a straight-up hero. - That's right. W.B. Jackson, Oscar Michelle and the Lincoln Motion Picture Film Company and all the other pioneers were the real heroes. They had to do it all themselves from finance to final cut. People like your uncle, Ella laid the groundwork for us today. - Then what made them stop? - Well lots of filmmakers stopped, Alphonso. I mean once Hollywood got the drift that black movies were a good business, they started making it themselves. - But that doesn't explain why he never talks about it. And why is he hiding who he really is. What happened to him? - I don't know Alphonso, but the sure thing is that he's not gonna tell us, so we're just gonna have to figure this out. - Well you know, you could start right here. We have one of the best film libraries in the country. - Well then maybe we can find an old newspaper or a magazine or a book or something that'll tell us what happened to uncle Buddy. - Well now that sounds like a plan. Meanwhile I'm gonna get this film to the lab and start restoring the picture and cleaning up the sound. - Ricky, I appreciate everything you're doing for me. - Oh please do you know how rare it is to find one of these black independent films in good condition, it's our heritage. And besides there is a little something in it for me. After you get your uncle Buddy back, I want him. 25. - Right I talked to coach Dawson today. Appealed coach Dawson. You missed practice, where were you? - I was late and you know how she is about being late, so I skipped it. - Oh well, why did you just say so. No big deal, right. Your team is just getting ready for the league championship, you don't need to practice. - But I'm practicing now, Daddy. - Ella, you made a commitment to the team and to yourself. Now you're 19 points away from being the league scoring champion. 19 points, I've seen you scored 19 points in one quarter. - Wow, I didn't know you were keeping track. - Well, I keep track and so do a lot of other people. Look baby doll, if you're the star in the right high school program, you can write your own ticket to college. - But daddy, maybe basketball isn't the only thing happening for me now. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, never mind. - This have anything to do with boys? - No, daddy. - Oh then what is it? - Can I just practice my free throws? - Yeah. Uncle Buddy, how you doing? - Evening, Joe, Ella. - Hi uncle Buddy. - I don't know what's going on with those two. They used to be inseparable, now they can't get far enough apart. - I don't know. - I think I wanna talk to uncle Buddy and get to the bottom of this. - Jonah don't interfere. Whatever it is, they need to work it out for themselves. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - All right, I've called around the country to every museum and scholar I can think of. I looked at the credits on all uncle Buddy's films and I've come up with a list of names of all the people he's worked with. - All right. - Come on, let's go. Come on, shoot it, shoot it. - Sorry. (instrumental music) - That's a big day, we're gonna take that championship. - [All] Yeah. - Break on three. One, two, three. (applause) - Can you come over tonight? - No, we're gonna go see a film. - Now that's what I call a movie. When that kid refused to join that gang, I was so proud of him, I could have cried. - You did cry. Don't think for a minute I believed you were really sneezing. - I never cry. - Oh daddy, remember the time we watched the "Poseidon Adventure". - I don't wanna talk about that. (laughter) - Ella. (car hooting) Hi, is this your house. - What are you doing here Rickie. - Well I could say I was just returning the original reels from the lab plus a gorgeous transfer, but the truth is I was hoping to say hello to your uncle. You're a friend of uncle Buddy's. - Not exactly, she's a friend of mine. This is Rickie Sewell from AFI. - Hi. - How do you do. - Is that the American Film Institute. - Oh yes. Oh, I have this for you. - Well let me help you. - No, it's okay dad, I got it. - You're telling me that my uncle Buddy, the barber is in reality the filmmaker W.B Jackson. Are we talking about the same uncle Buddy who has never mentioned a word of this to me in my entire life. That was great. Ella, I understand why you did what you did, but I don't understand why uncle Buddy hid this from everybody for so many years. - Maybe that's none of anybody's business. Maybe none of you know what it's like to fail so miserably at something you truly loved. - But uncle Buddy, you didn't fail. - Child, how dare you tell me what to think of my own life. - Ella. - Here, I just had conscious (indistinct). - Alphonso, I think I've lost him. Rickie came over with a copy of the film and uncle Buddy walked in. And he's so upset, I don't think he'll ever talk to me again. - Come on, it's gonna be okay. - It's worse than ever. - Ella, it's not your fault. - I just feel so helpless. - Hey, we'll think of something. Tomorrow's another day. - I finally got one right. - Well, what? - Tomorrow's another day and it's from "Gone with the wind." - Oh, oh, I knew that. - Alphonso, you're always here when I need you. - Well, you know everybody's gotta be somewhere. - I'm really glad that you're here. - I like knowing that. - You know I couldn't have done any of it without you. All those phone calls and all that research. That's it. - What's it? - The research. Come on let's go. - Where are we going? - To my house. I'll use the phone upstairs and you use the phone downstairs. Come on, we have to find somebody who knew him. (instrumental music) - Hello, is this Mr. Washington? My name's Ella Jackson and I was told that you might have known my uncle W.B Jackson. You did? Alphonso, guess what. - So give me the 4-1-1. - I found somebody who knows him. - You did, who? - Buck Washington. He was an actor in uncle Buddy's films. - All right this was like a miracle or something. He's going out of town. One more day he would have been gone, but guess what. - What. - I get to see him tomorrow afternoon. - Ella, wow, tomorrow. Tomorrow's the game, the game. - I can do both really. Trust Fo. - The tall tan Texan. Wow, Ella that's one of your uncle Buddy's films. - I played the villain of the piece, the corrupt sheriff and the employee of the evil cattle band. Oh you must be Ella. - Hi. - And I'm Alphonso. - Alphonso, welcome. Yep that's the biggest role I ever did with WB as we knew him. I can't tell you how marvelous it is to know that he's still with us. Please come, have a seat. - Wow, you really done a lot of stuff. The lady who let us in said you had a long career. - Well, it's been a struggle, but it has had its moments. I was the original banana in the cornflakes commercials. - Hey, I've never seen those. - Well, perhaps it was before your time. How old are you? No, no, don't answer. - Mr. Washington, did you do a lot of movies with my uncle Buddy? - Well, I started as a bit player. By two films later, I had my first co-starring role. - Wow, you must have been really good. - True, but it was your uncle Buddy who gave me the chance to grow and to become even better. That was his style. He assembled this marvelous little repertory company. Myself of course, the fabulous Ella Du Champs, Lester Lawrence, Juneberg Baker. He's probably the funniest man who ever lived. It was just a wonderful team of actors and W.B gave us the opportunity to do what all actors live to do. What black actors seldom get the chance to do. - What's that? - Act, just simply to act without being stereotyped by someone's prejudice or breathtaking lack of vision. - Mr. Washington, you knew my uncle Buddy, you worked with him. You said that he was great, everybody said he was great. I don't understand, what made him quit. - Well, your uncle Buddy probably came closer than anyone else to breaking through the color line. But in the end, I fear it broke him. - What do you mean? - Excuse me, Ella. - Alphonso, I can't leave yet. - Oh, yes your basketball game. Ella, this is for you. This is your uncle Buddy as I knew him. - Wow. Mr. Washington, please continue, I wanna hear this. - Well, I'll try to be brief. It all started one day when W.B came back off the road. You see whenever we completed a film, W.B would go on the road from town to town, theater to theater showing the film. Well, this particular day he came back with the most amazing news. He had just made a deal with two white Hollywood producers and we were gonna make a real Hollywood movie. - Wow, my uncle Buddy made a Hollywood movie. Nobody's ever said anything about that. - Less said, the better. - Why, what happened. - You know it takes only one straw to break the camel's back. So the deal for W.B's Hollywood western was made, contracts just been signed. And the bigwigs, wow, they were so slap happy about all the new audience money they're about to pull in, they decided they'd celebrate with a big party at the country club. Old W.B got all dolled up I tell you, he knew how to dress. He had Ella Du Champs on his arm and they were looking just as fine as you please when they stepped out of that rented limousine and walked right into that fancy restaurant. But they couldn't get past the door. - What? - Why, what happened? - Well, the Maitre D said that colored weren't allowed and W.B just laughed at him and told him not only was he going inside, but there was a dinner party going on inside in his honor sponsored by the head of the studio. He gave him the man's name and that waiter backed off. - I bet he did. - Well, he went inside to check. 20 minutes later, he came back with the head of the studio with a napkin tucked under his chin and a champagne glass in his hand, but he verified that he knew W.B. - And then they let him inside. - No darling. The head of the studio said there'd been some mistake, that he hadn't known that W.B himself had intended to come. And besides, the party was for the picture, the picture. The country club served only whites but if W.B and Ella wanted to go around the back, perhaps they could set up a small table and a couple of chairs just in the kitchen. It only takes that one final straw. Ella and me, well, we kept on doing Hollywood movies. But W.B, I believe that was that straw. - Great, we barely have enough time to get to the bus and get you to your game on time. Well, Bo, you're really close to blowing it now. Hello Bo, are you with me or should I have scotty beam you up. Hey, where you going? - I gotta go this way, catch the bus back to uncle Buddy's. - Are you crazy? What about the game, the scholarship, the trophy. - Alphonso, I hurt him. When I opened up that trunk, I opened up a lot of pain. I gotta go back and tell him I'm sorry. I didn't know what he had gone through, I didn't know about his dream. - Ella, talk to him after the game, this is the big one. You can't possibly make it to the game on time if you go there first. - I gotta go now, you catch the bus and cover for me. - Cover for you. Yeah, right. - Doesn't it seem just a little strange to you that Buddy is not going to Ella's game. I mean it is the championship. And when I asked him about it, he just said he wasn't going. - That is strange. - It sure is. - Good night, Buddy. - Where is she? - Joe, this isn't like her. - I just want to know she's all right, then I wanna kill her. (crowd cheering) - Uncle Buddy. Uncle Buddy, please talk to me. - I used to talk to you. I used to talk to you all the time. I used to think that you were the only person in the world who understood me. I trusted you. - Then why did you hide this from me? - Because it was none of your business. If you had just minded your own business and left that full trunk alone. - Then I would have never found out who you really are. People love and respect you. Uncle Buddy, you're an inspiration to people making movies now. - Who's been filling your head with such nonsense. - Buck Washington. He told me how brave and courageous you were, how you wouldn't back down, how those white men at that restaurant. - Ella, you don't know what you're talking about. - I do, I know that no one should take that kind of insult. They hurt you. I'm sorry. - Oh, little girl, little girl, I've been through much worse than that, it never stopped me. Ever since I first held a camera in my hand, I was on a mission. I was gonna take my company to Hollywood, get inside the system and make the kind of films we all dreamed of, where I could show black people as people. Well it never happened. - What do you mean? - I knew the days of race films were coming to an end and I was determined to keep on making movies. I had gotten myself a Hollywood contract. You know how rare that was. They gave me more money to make one film than I had spent in all my films combined. Man, I had business at the country club. It did hurt me, I can't deny it, but it didn't stop me, Ella. The next day on the set, I pretended nothing had happened. After all for them, nothing had. My whole company was there, Ella Du Champs looking lovely as ever. She was all set to play this female gunslinger who falls madly in love with this fearless sheriff played by... - Buck Washington. - Right. No sooner had we got the cameras rolling, than these studio execs, the same guys from the dinner came strolling up to me. They didn't like Ella's costume. They wanted it shorter, skimpier. I protested but then Ella stepped in trying to protect me. She said she didn't mind, she could make a burlap bag look good and she did. Then they started on Buck. Why I make this sheriff so serious all the time. Who's gonna believe a serious black man. Why not throw in a couple of eye rolls, a couple of knee slaps. - But it was your movie, you were the director. - No, it wasn't, not anymore. From the first day, they overrode everything I wanted to do, every decision I made. If I managed by some chance to shoot a scene the way I wanted to, they'd have their boys in the editing room change it all around to the way they wanted it to be. the way they wanted black people to be. Before it was over, Buck was almost wearing blackface. And Ella, my beautiful Ella. She was dressed like a tramp. To see her like that, to see what they did to her. - You couldn't stop it? - No, I tried. Oh I was able to protect them from some things, but in the end, they suffered. Ella and I were engaged to be married. And the dream I had promised them, the dream of honor and dignity and respect was dead. All the life kicked and yanked out of it. I failed them, honey. I failed the people that meant the most to me in my life. - You gave them a start. You were just one person, you couldn't do it all by yourself. But you made a beginning for other black filmmakers. Their success is your success. - Don't you have somewhere you have to be? - I'm sorry uncle Buddy. I'm sorry that I opened your trunk and let out all those memories and all that hurt. I'm sorry that you couldn't do what you wanted to do for your friends. (somber music) Maybe you couldn't do it the way that you wanted to, but you won uncle Buddy, you won. (somber music) (crowd cheering) - There's Alphonso. - Mr. Jackson. - Where's Ella? - Oh, Ella. Where's Ella. - Alphonso. - There she is. - [Coach] Watch your passing. - She's here. - Sorry I'm late. - Have a seat, Ella. - But coach. - I said, have a seat. - I can't believe you're gonna bench me. What about the game. - You sit there and think think about that. - Hey, what is that coach doing, She's sitting here on the bench. - You're complaining about Ella getting benched. Two seconds ago you were ready to kill her. - Yeah, but that coach is gonna cost Ella the high scores trophy. - Come on guys, let's do it. (instrumental music) - [Team] Go Lakers. - All right girls, we have come a long way together here. We got only a little bit further to go. Are we gonna make it? - [Team] Yes. - Are we gonna get there? - [Team] Yes. - I can't hear you, are we gonna get there? - [Team] Yes. - All right. (applause) Ella, I want you to go in for Tamara. - Get out there. - Two down in. 17 more to go, huh. - It's okay, we'll get it next time. (instrumental music) - Come on, Ella. You can do it, Ella. Come on, Ella, come on. Great pass, baby doll. What, it was a good pass. (instrumental music) (crowd cheering) - How many does Ella have? - Uh 17. (instrumental music) Did you see what she just did? - Yeah, of course I did, it was wonderful. - What do you mean wonderful, she just blew the (indistinct) - She did what is best for the team. You should be proud. - Free chicken for my girls. Free chicken for everybody. - Daddy, I didn't make high score. - No. - I'm sorry. - Ella, I'm so proud of you. - All right hit the shower, Ella. You too, Cindy. - Thanks, bye. Hey guys, wait up. - Not this time, champ. Somebody else has dibs on driving you home. I will take the bag. - You played a great game tonight, Ella. - I was okay. It was my team that was great. - Their success is your success. Oh by the way, this postcard came for you today. - Ricky wants you to speak at her film festival. I'm sorry uncle Buddy, I'll take care of this, I promise. I'll straighten it all out. I'll do it first thing in the morning, even tonight. ♪ You must remember this a kiss is just a kiss ♪ ♪ A sigh is just a sigh ♪ - You're gonna do it uncle Buddy? - Do I have a choice?
