In the olden days, when there was no civilization, a young trader, Akanni Aduloju waxed greater than all his contemporaries. Everyone called him Owo. Owo was tall and very strong. He was blessed with land and livestock, He was surrounded by beautiful wives, and thousands of slaves. Owo had everything. But, Owo was not a happy man despite what he possessed A strange illness had weighed him down for several months, Which almost claimed his life. Akanni sneaked out of his town, into a far away land to find answers from Fijabi. Fijabi... The deadliest, most powerful sorceress in all of the west. Fijabi was said to have wiped out an entire town just by spitting into the calabash. If the remedy to Owo's predicament is in the hands of man, it will be Fijabi Olojuina. Tell me what you want. I want to live long. I want to... I want to remain young. And I have heard that there is no spell that you cannot cast. It is too late for you. The spirits have claimed your soul. There is hope for your sons. The sacrifice of make old young. Hmm The ritual, will happen 25 years from now, after which they will not age. They must continue this ritual, every 25 years. As young men, one son must fulfill the cycle, by presenting a young innocent woman for the ritual. One son must present a bride to the spirit of Sagbadewe. Owo, take caution, and follow all the necessary steps. Make sure, that not one step is missed. And that the cycle is not broken. We will do exactly as you have instructed, Great one.

Tests and scans have shown nothing. How can I help sir? Well... He can come back if the pain persists, but for now, ‪tell him he's discharged. - All right doctor. - All right. I'm sorry, I didn't realize there were visitors here. - I'll come back. - Oh, it's okay. Err... come in. What is it? Come in. Oh... Urh... Errm... we've been trying to convince him he's okay. He's always complaining about some ailment or the other. Remember that time that, He thought he had some kind of skin disease I remember. Or the time that he thought that tiny pimple that appeared on his face was some sign of, some exotic pox or something. Don't laugh at me because I care about my health. Okay, erm... So, what's the diagnosis? Is he going to be okay, or is there an actual problem? So, Doctor Subomi has seen some elevated white blood cell activity. We'll have to keep him under watch for a few more hours. - Okay... You heard the lady. - Okay. Let's give him some time. - To rest. - All right. I'm so sorry, I thought it was empty. Sorry. So... Am I going to be fine? Eh... actually doctor said that you're fine and I should discharge you. Just didn't like the way they were laughing at you. What's your name? Busola. Busola. It's a beautiful name. Thank you. Thank you. It's not a problem. Uhm... you could wait an hour and then leave, if that's okay? I have to continue with my rounds. So, I... I guess I'll be seeing you around? I can't believe it. Look at her. Look at this day dreamer. Linda. Today, I caught Busola hitting on a patient with her eyes. Busola? Is that true? See, let me just tell you. Don't get your hopes up. Because he's... he's clearly out of your league. That's... I'm just saying. If you had seen him, you'd have said the same thing too.

Thank you for everything. I can't thank you enough. It's not nothing. Really. Goodnight. Hey. I've been looking for you. You should go and see you mother. Where's my dad? It appears he had too much to drink last night. We'll see him when we get back. Okay? Let's go. Where are you taking her to? Mummy. Mummy. No wait. Mummy. Mummy. You still carry that thing everywhere you go. I can't help it. My mum used to do the same thing. Makes me feel closer to her. Are you excited to meet my brothers? I have been dying to. It's always one excuse or the other, it's like you guys just hate being in the same place all at once. It's not my fault that they are always working. Sure. I've heard all the excuses. I'm super nervous. I mean, what if they don't like me? My brothers love me. And I love you. Therefore they love you by extension. You and your words. So, what is this tradition that forces all of you to come back to your family house once a year? That is what happens when you're rich from a young age. You have these... foolish traditions. Hmm... But it's nice. That way we get to see each other at least once every year. No excuses. Hmm... And you think it won't be weird to bring me? Everyone is excited to see you. I'm just worried about embarrassing myself. I mean what if they just look at me and say. This one that doesn't even know what a salad fork is and cut me out. Trust me. That is irrelevant. You are my wife. You belong here. Speaking of which. We have arrived. Nice to finally meet you. Come here. Hmm... Let me look at you.
