It is no harm to give a tiny appreciation Disasters in China. There is an accident happened in Chai Wan nuclear power Plant. The nuclear reactor have been leaked The people in the area have been evacuated The coolant system probably was not working; the radiation has affected the civilian population In the location near Hong Kong so far 8 people died and 27 are wounded. The Chinese government still not issued any statement There are a lot of misunderstandings among the departments.. They are trying to prevent a meltdown. We hoped that the military can give some answers Chen Da Wei. Hathaway, self-foot hands behind you! Open 16! Go, go, go! Search everything! Get off that! Okay. 1, 2, 3! up! That was founding in your cell. You have adding $ 900 to all your account, cono series account in your cell block. Is this your tattoo? With it you have opened a terminal and then give you command line? And then you broke to the network and plus up the balances? No, I used to call Santa in the north pole And told if he can do Christmas earlier this year A virus took our control system. How was this possible? We have any evidence? It could be a 'Rat' or other device. We must strengthen our defenses. If the attack fails, I had an alternative. What were they after? access codes, passwords? -I don't think so. Why not? They caused the reactor to overheat and explode! What do you think? It's a terrorist attack? No. And then? Blow up this state? No. -Then what? What motive? -I do not know. I'd like to contact the FBI's cyber-crimes branch for assistance. Then I can dig deeper. And we can understand more. Then call them and collaborate with them! -Then I decided. You can go now. -Thank you What we know about this guy? His grandfather was a military commander in Shanghai in the 20s, and in the 30s, against the Japanese during the Civil War. his father become China Undersecretary for trade to the UN. He came in New York brought high school studied in sciences, MIT. His sister's is network engineer in the private sector. -Is he grows up in New York too? -No. He's our rising star at PLA Cyber Defense Section You liaise with them? He invited us to hen house Carol. Stanley, we go head to head with the Chinese on these cyber intrusions. Every day for the week Not a bad idea to be face to face working with them For once You monitor very closely, what they do and do not have access too, okay? Okay! Send the code. Okay Okay Hello! Can I keep you a company? Im not what you thinking are. - Not interested. - Are you her boyfriend? I'm her brother, Her brother said she is not interested. -I need to talk to you. -Hey, listen, this is my card. Hey! I was talking to her! Okay. There goes the second martini. English much be better -Tomorrow, I can't, I think it's impossible -Why not? I got an optical overlay network that's got to be up in about 17 days. They sent me some code, Lien the Black hat hitting Chai Wan reactor. When I looked at the code ... It was a... and I need a network engineer which I can trust. fully trust. Hundred percent. When do we leave? The meltdown in China and run up soya yesterday were facilitated by the same RAT. How got loaded in the first places we don't know. But once we inside in the club to be aim what it really is a remote access tool. A RAT. A RAT job was opened a back door of our system and call home The Black hat then use this back door to inject the second part His payload That's what happened with soy Now we look at the RAT and the payload closely We think they.... -Written by different artist how we have figured that out was the code in the RAT Those several years old is ... graceful The payload on other hand is frantic, confused. Frantic? Or overwritten? So the question we dealing with is? Is there somewhere we can talk? Daniel is qualified in computer forensic The interim can write that report. Oh really. And who we need if not Daniel? A liaison, liaison group implies mutuality If you don't like our boys what idea who you want to bring to the dance? A man named Hathaway. He is a convicted hacker serving 15 years in US Canaan in way Pennsylvania. You telling me some hacker in prison is hitting our financial market? No, but we want Hathaway in our team So he can help us in the investigation He hit four major banks ran up 46 million in damages And that's just what we know about You want the DOJ to do anything other than laugh? Daniel said two author of the virus I do not know who wrote the second half, but the first half.. The RAT, the remote access tool, that Daniel call linen graceful One of the original authors was me I co-wrote it as a gag eight years ago at MIT. My roommate the genius lead author, it was ... -Nicholas Hathaway. That's right The hacker found the RAT online, modify it If we want move around within this code looking for the clue the hackers identity We need is the architect The reactor in China I heard about, but ... The spiking soy future I dont know any of this we not got a lot any news in here The US government would like your technical advice on this In exchange for that we gonna furlough you out of here You sign that in the last page, and we get you process You will wear ankle bracelet and be accompanied by US Marshal you're computer access will be restricted If you want to study the whole document, you can go right ahead. then come back in month or two. I'm done -You didn't sign it -Yeah, why would I signed it? Why, because of generosity the Assistant US Attorney and granting your furlough both of you and the Assistant US Attorney can stick that document up at your ass I'm Sorry? Why are you sorry? I insulted you, What would you sorry for I'm not sorry -Don't think you gonna ... -Hey! You want reach me out of here, to solve your trading thing dilemma and I get the furlough for couple of weeks, are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how much progress you can made and strike this complex without someone like me? Zero. -This is not a negotiation. -I just made one. you want me pass it upstairs my assistance resolve the identification and the apprehended the guy you after I want you to keep my sentence I can bend to you task my ass back in .... Those are the terms. Guards. Review is over How badly you need this guy? -How good to see you bro! -And I, more than you think to see you. Let's get out of here. So you planned to reunited with your friend from the moment you landed? Bear in my mind you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine. please keep him out of sight you can help it He rip off and stole the code. -What the hell is this? -Why? The agreement wasn't approval on the presence of his computer access I approved it. - DAJ approval. -Now change the gold coast? -Hola Chica, You came to me How must I do my work, if I have ...or something? -Chica? I'm a Spanish? - Whats the hell going on? I dedicated to get your way here I pull every string to get your convicted sprung from the street -Captain Chan. I never asked, But I offered partnership an equivalent -Or we will do our own -I'll be happy To pass back to Canaan and put your ass on the first plane back to china. We apologize. My brother miss understood our arrangement, special agent. Look around After the morning backups. Your network is sitting behind deep packing inspection intrusion, protection It is extent your firewall. Exactly. Someone had to come physically to the room plug the virus in We review key card scan and surveillance tape, there was one unauthorized to entry And I thinking now a RAT witness - Too complicated, when he do down there Yeah, what your proposing didn't happened There is only one person has authorized to access this terminals. Me And the password and my thumbprint. May I ? I assume I have approval now? This is the code for RAT's It's compact, it slips under... You never pick up by Have you ever left your USB drive on your desk - I suppose so Who work so doesn't like you, recently hired or fired? -No -Who ? Lozano. His mother passes away two weeks ago John Lozano. He's only on job for a month. -He has access to your office? -Yes -I will an employment record. -Everything will call up phony. Except this you got the photo ID? Yeah This section of the code right here is a mess There are 25 lines He left text it looks incomplete. -Or as notes for himself. -Dead end idea. Maybe he still writing Yeah, that's good So if you got a ability you move command anyway you want what will you do? I play long and low key I Do want this spike and play month after month. -No risk to be detection -Right But our guy jack soy by 250% in a day. It's weird. He knew he will bring down the heat - Maybe he needed cash - he got the money from Won soy. And it took to write for the code next You still have really to come. We have Lozano's photo. Keep any routine surveillance fixed Like carding identity theft Who work in West Texas prison gang Our cowboy has a tattoo on his shoulder, he is law Spartacus I send something to you right now That's him, On the bottom left Alonso Reyes get two years in Huntsville for carding Parole Move back to L.A. I have a lair to pick him up. You got to monitor is home grid, I did We got a better shot, get him first to look at him ourselves Is that not why you brought me here? -Okay? -Yeah, go ahead That's mean you and me on the money unless you think you can do on your own too? -I do okay -You do..ha! Let's see how you handle the financial sector Thanks, Stanley. -My eyes on you -Where do you think I going? This guy one step away from I'm get out of jail with free card So, how can I help? We want to see your trading record of you trader Who took a large profit from the soy runner Your request, to get to turned over recorded to the FBI and a foreign power On thousands of private brokers and traders? But I can't possible to accommodate you You gonna protect a person who manipulated your market. No, you're casting your net weight to wide Mr. Chen. You want to see my data, you need to come with something more tangible data, something with probable your cause Gary! Can I call you Gary? How this can be tangible in the next 15 seconds I will call Laura Green at the Commodity Trading Commission And I say: Hi Laura how are you doing I would like to launch an official investigation on one Gary Baker. So the headline N-Tech Official Investigate for ateing and batting cyber criminals. Leaks to CNN in next 90 so make at 3:00 news psycho roll And for the night news that we could do Am I being tangible ? Gary? Look around here, but I stay here with you, No, take nothing What happened to you? drop...set a meet? drop...set a meet?

She probably called 911. -Who is this woman? -A manager... Let me see. Proximity sensor. Refresh Rate: one day. Try it now. Barrett, is Jessup. Thank you, Jessup. We better make calling the money pay off, Reyes is isn't, he's dead. Oh great! Wait a minute I'm looking for buyers of soy or just the sellers. Only our player knew exactly when to get out Reyes got an e-mail. about the drop tonight Without Rayes we got to find a new link to our main players on these .... It's time Jessup? No, a body ten block away You getting to not enough for one day I can't blame my way it works, don't be stayed on I go too You look not so different from the picture. What picture?

Any terrorist attack, any decorations? -No claim, no statement -What is this guy want? -What's the malware attack? -Program will lose the controllers. PLC's They turn the pump turn on turn off to cold the reactor Any idea where the attack origin air I was track when the malware when the core went We have to evacuate But if the is machine failed it should save memory to diagnostic file Thats right, and if the memory don't may be the trace code, May be this guy real IP address. Place servers is the control room, everything is still hot We are fighting a meltdown. Chen Lien. Inspector Alex Trang, Hong Kong police. Hathaway, US Marshal Mark Jessup. Hello! Is this them -is this the guy? -Yeah We got anything? Here they are. Johnny Lee, Yang Li, Samuel Wu. Lee just came out of prison two months ago.

Short range, we would never pick it up See he don't come to meet them he comes to this Kassar texts, Wu, Yang and Li walk by, the receiver in their pocket, pick it up They read it delete it Kassar never meet them, never see them. No mail, no phone calls, no nothing. It's slick. -Can you crack it? -In about a month. -It's lock in GPG encryptions -At least in 512 Kb We pick him up, we all over him We let them ride until to the main player You don't have any choice This guy here, he will gonna roll. I think we let him ride Yeah Sun rise in two hours When this is over, What will you do? I do not know, fix TVs, garage doors opener Do you still gonna like me, if I'm fixing garage door openers I don't know, maybe. -Give me a bottle of water. -Right away. They move the money.

What kind of life is that for her -Chen it's Barrett. - I hear you The meal we caught Li and Yang. And listen we cant wait surveillance in Shek O. On the ground floor. Hey, over here! Come on this way! Hold on there..hold on Stay down! Hijau (Green) Hijau (Green) Merah (Red), Biru (Blue)Biru (Blue) Merah, bagaimana? (How is he?), Sepertinya tidak bertahan lama boss (It seems he cannot hold anymore boss) Go! go! Come on! Elias. Coming. Come on. Don't wait, get them out of here! -Hei. -its Paul Lang, Whatever we restore the water The bug ..... and to stabilize the reactor it still hot, but we can get in. Hei! Can I take the car? Mark! The temperature inside is high, about 53.8 degrees. You have eight minutes, then you must exit. If someone is sick, you must return immediately. I still don't get it. What is he after? Why this? Otherwise, you'll be irradiated. - Hei What she say? - Move fast. Wong! Hey! Take him, both of you get out of here! What are you doing We were right In the memory dump there is fragment of the malware, but it's corrupted Maybe it's IP address. But it is too full hole Get one of the team bug me in "O" 7 in out my door and flushing files But when I come in trail they retrieve all this data and all they can retrieval Black Widow's is NSA software Examine fragments and reconstruction original within a couple of hours of super computing The cases like yours they loan it to us Rich, I need access to Black Widow. It is classified tech with the Chinese Are you kidding? that is not even getting into Hathaway to use it We need full Cooperation Rich, You aware you're justice, we at NSA. I want too I can and I don't want it. An uncategorical "no". Okay, how does it work? you gave NSA's the data they run it, and then what? Now they have the remote logging while we run it -You not thinking -Come on they got the key of the kingdom. Our guy's address may be, and whatever is cook up next, Is right in there? only we can read it. Let's go. My old correspondence with Donahue is here. - But there is no way the logging is still active - I'm not goanna use that logging. Ok Donahue, the NSA contact you talk If NSA discover the intrusion -You Sure you want do this? -FBI can explain after the fact? You locate this guy okay you got discovered, you're dead meat. You know that, don't you? The NSA guy you're talking to What his supervisor name? Ben Hitchens. Maybe it's better for two of you, and you weren't around So you can deny me in here -How are you feel about this? -Not good It's worse for the guy in there. I was surprise you are alone. Washington didn't sees Chai Wan. In light of the fact you were contacted by an FBI agent working on Joint Task Force with Chinese Cyber specialist become concerned about the security of your Black Widow remote logins, we strongly suggest you change your password You asked him to change his password? When he downloaded the PDF, What he downloads is the key logger Got it! Now we wait. We're in You can call me Chica and tell me whenever you want. This is our hacker home IP address is the home server. It is not in Mumbai nor in Minneapolis, nor in Riga. -He is in Jakarta! -Can you crack the site? No, it's an armor hosting company like a hotel, Swiss bank. Exclusively for blackhat hackers! so it's bullet proof. The server is in there but we can't crack the site - I saw the movie strictly low tech - has in? Go to Jakarta, bug the place get his hand on his server. We don't have visa or badges for work in Indonesia. Can FBI get the documented? After the NSA turn down, I would stay away from DC Then I'll work for myself for the entry I will take face to face with my boss. - Alright. - Alright. Access denied. You have been anywhere? No, No into the server But I got in into Interarm's accounting -Look at this -Charges to our boy's account -Okay, so? -Look at this $14, $17. Now, $16,400, five times. Pay to Satellite shot, Satellitesshot.......... time. -What kind of shot? -This kind. - High res scan! - Off the coast of Malaysia. -What's there? -Nothing too much. Why you scan there? -Good day. - Da Wei, nice to see you again. What was wrong? I am happy to tell you that We have identified the source of it. Thanks to Hathaway I found the source of the virus. We need proof, we need to go there, In order resolved it quickly Hold on, the Department of Defense has contacted us. Hathaway is a computer brilliant, But they shall back We need to teach them. The hole set agreement and now does not comply You know that we have problems with America But your colleague is not our priority. Keeping our commercial vessels is more important We cannot lose our agreement because of Hathaway We don't need him anymore. He will be handed to America. -You finish. -Excuse me We are so close to catch the killer! We know, but we must do without him. We will tell the Americans and concludes the investigation. Spider Bit, no visa for friend. move now -This is Barrett. -What the hell did you let go on there, Carol? -Pollack? -Then you know what your guy did? -What are you talking about? -Cut the crap. I'm talking about they called god damm NSA and Defense. our guy blow the reactor in Chai Wan -Don't you watch CNN? -That's not the point. -That's not the point. -That's exactly the point. This guy we working will drop the big hammer nothing twice about it Came on, come on, don't involve the 9 11 on me You've never lost anyone there Stanley. look I'm under orders. now so are you Bring him in, Carol, bring him in What is going on? -Damm it, Hathaway's gone. -Hey, this say he is here. -He cut his bracelet? -He can't it will signal the alarm, this say it working -Check his settings. A reset once every 24 hours. We have been tracking him since from L.A. They are in Chendown street -Mr. Chao? -Yes, they are in there. Thank You. They're coming for you.. -They coming for you because of Black Widow. -That's was fast I want you to turn to the American So tell me and walk away Barrett and Jessup will back me up. NSA won't care, and because of you now we have Black Widow. You have to run. You're goanna refuse the order? You escape we reconnecting in Jakarta. -Now look you're the boss whose got 2 and 2 -Not turning you in. Do I go with you or Nick? -Neither -What's? It doesn't involved you Who may I trust? He's right. I don't see any light at the end of this tunnel anymore. What did you do, Chen Dai Wei? If you owes now to get leave him behind? -You not go down that road -I decide what for me. yeah and I decide for me. I go, and you not. Now we need our data. Here, you take the car. You may have to move faster. I'll be on touch after the Core Bay. He's in Kowloon. right here. You goanna take him to custody? -I follow orders. -What's your order? Stop the bad guy or to arrest Hathaway? I'm goanna to ask you a personal question. Don't answer, if you don't want to. Who do you lose in 9 11? My husband You got to rid of that thing. We got a couple hours. Hold it, hold it He's on the move again. He is in Hong Kong. -The Core Bay. -Where? He headed to the Core Bay. I thought you going separately.

Here your passport Here, take the money We're depart to Malaysia The coordinates are right here. Yeah, right here look at this This guy got 74 million in cash, Write a code what for? What's here? Got tin, Palm oil, hell of tin mining, agriculture. Hey, these pump ... It is stasik pump? They use the same model Stasik water pump as Chai Wan reactor. The same brand, controlled by same PLC's? -Yup. -And what they mining over there? Ferra Limites, -Mining tin -Tin? Malaysia is one of the biggest exporters. And there are others four mining operations in the next valley. This is a river bed. They divert the water with Stasik pumps. You know why Chai Wan reactor? We were looking through the glass a wrong way He didn't target the reactor to knock out the reactor he targeted to knock out the pumps He was rehearsing, it was a rehearsal Chai Wan is a rehearsal. He wants to shut down the pumps And flood the tin mines. And the valleys, villages, villages people and the... Create a sort of tin, And tin price will rise and shoot up. His 74 million from Chicago were to buy options in tin ore. That's what they doing. He is son of bitch Jakarta. Indonesia. System configured for a single user. Copy files to the external hard drive. Alright look at this A third version of the virus controlling other PLCs. 53... 53 PLC's. Five different tin mines which is to flood Five river valleys.
