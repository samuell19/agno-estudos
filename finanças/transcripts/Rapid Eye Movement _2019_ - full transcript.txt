We need to talk numbers. - He can talk to sales. - They're not the problem. You are. You've been on the fringe for too long. Your slot's going Top 40. You new owners, you're just... I don't do Top 40. Uh, I do the eclectic, and it works. Pulse of New York. We want all nine million listeners of the city. Not just a sliver out in Williamsburg that feeds your ego. My ego? Was it my ego that promotes undervalued artist instead of your processed plastic bump and grind bands? We're not renewing your contract. Not with these numbers. Not ever. Your ratings, they just need to come up. Or you're done. Oh... Tough meeting, Rick, huh? Almost makes me believe that there's justice in the universe after all. I never took you for a dreamer, Marcus. Just a... Just a sore loser for not getting the morning slot. Yeah? Well, I'm keeping my slot, though. Fuck... Try that again, mother... Oh, Rick, um, your wife's here. - She's looking for you. - Oh, shit. Hey, sweetheart. What you doing here? Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to show up to your first marriage counseling session and get stood up by your husband? Uh... It's just that I... I'll give you one more chance. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. There's a... super exclusive marriage retreat in Newport at the end of the month, and I want us to go. You know I... I had to pull a lot of strings to get us in. - Mm-hm. - And I just... Please, I just need you to wanna go, okay? Yeah. I guess, yeah. You guess? God. Does it mean nothing to you? How much sleep I have lost worrying about us? You're losing sleep? You're losing sleep? Yes, Rick, that's what I said. You're a genius. I gotta go, okay? The 28th, buddy! Remember that! Oh! Um, I was just... Sleep deprivation. - Get me intel. - Yeah. Of course. Mm-hm. A stunt's not gonna raise your ratings quick enough. No, no, no. A sleep deprivation marathon would be great. What's the record on this thing? Two hundred and sixty-four hours. That's 11 days awake. Whoa, 11 days? Seriously? Okay, 11 days it is. No harm in trying. Let's, uh... Let's make it a charity fundraiser, huh? We'll, uh, we'll find a disease or something. When might this earthshaking slumber party happen? Somewhere around the 28th would be perfect. We're doing a Wake-A-Thon charity fundraiser. So, who's got me a disease? How about AIDS? No, too '90s. Next. How about breast cancer? - I don't like breast cancer. - Nobody likes - breast cancer, Phil. - Come on. Raise my eyebrows. Fibrocystic disease. It's another woman thing. - Is it fatal? - No, - but that's... But... - It has, it has to be fatal. It has to be something that grabs people by the throat. It could be in today's headlines. Dr. Harold Rance, SMA researcher murdered. That's the dude hanging from the bridge. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - It just happened this morning. - Yeah, his, his guts were like, hanging all out, and... What's, uh... What's SMA? "Spinal Muscular Atrophy." "SMA is the number one genetic killer of children. Victims never acquire or progressively lose the ability to walk, stand, or move. And, ultimately, fatal respiratory complications. No known cure." And so, New York, with this Wake-A-Thon, SMA will feel the wrath of Rick Weider. A webcam will show me awake around the clock inside a glass booth on the street in Times Square. Even bathroom breaks will be strictly monitored. Keeping a watchful eye on me will be Dr. Maurice Falco, eminent expert in the field of sleep research. Any thoughts, doctor? This is not just a question of mere physical endurance, for that would punish only mortal flesh. It is rather an intense assault on the mind, or dare I say, it's the soul... that denies a man his deeply needed nightly escape from the horrors of this world. Sobering thoughts, indeed, doctor. So, I'll be awake day and night, night and day, starting October 24th. How long can I last? Four days? Five? A week? Or beyond? Stay tuned for news, weather, and sports. Rick Weider. As an SMA parent, I can't tell you what this Wake-A-Thon means. Oh, no. You're, uh, you're expressing it fine. Well, it's great to hear a man as passionate as yourself involved. Impossible is nothing when it matters. After all, "A man's reach should always exceed his grasp." "Or what's a heaven for?" Robert Browning. He's not quoted much. Yeah, and he didn't really become popular until after he died. The world record, 11 days. Can you do it? Uh, it's, uh... It's daunting. But are you committed to it? It would bring so much attention to our cause. Well, I'll, uh, I'll certainly give it a try. It's a decision of the will. Dedication. Dedication. That's what Dr. Rance couldn't understand. Uh, wait, Rance, the... The dead guy on the bridge? He didn't care enough about what he was leaving undone. That's why we don't have a cure yet. We need dedicated warriors. Like yourself. So, how much money will you raise? Uh, we, uh, we haven't set a definite goal yet. - Millions. - Millions? Uh, we'll be lucky to get 20 grand, sir. Twenty grand. Twenty grand. Twenty grand? Are you out of your mind? You need to have a bigger vision for this, Weider. Okay, why, why don't you give me your number, and we'll orchestrate something? It'd be wonderful if you could help us. Damn. - I think that was the killer. - What killer? - That, that killer? The... - The bridge killer. If... - Whoa. - If... we could get this guy to confess or something, we would be news! Co... confess? Rick, how is he gonna confess on air? That's not gonna happen. That's... - We should call the police. - No. No, no, no. We gotta milk it first. "Milk it"? Haven't I taught you anything? - Not, not really. - What the... - Right. Okay. - We'll milk it. - Right. Do you wanna... - Go back to school. - Go back to school, Miguel. - We'll milk it. No... - We'll milk it. - Go back to school. You son of a bitch. Don't tell me you forgot the date. - Look, Kathy, I... - Deliberately. You deliberately did that. No. Wait, wait, wait. No. Hold it. You don't understand. Uh, sorry, sir. My job is on the line, my career, my whole... Now, I have a chance to catch a killer on the air. - It could be huge! - A killer? What are you talking about? Are you completely delusional, Rick? All right, look, you're busy. Let's talk about it tonight at home. All right? No, Rick. You know what, I'm gonna go stay with my sister for a while. - I have to do some thinking. - Oh, come on, really? You hate her. Good luck with your stunt. Good morning, New York. The great WZLW Wake-A-Thon with me, Rick Weider, has begun. We are broadcasting live from Times Square. Night and day, day and night, I'll be awake, fighting the good fight for SMA. The number one genetic killer of children. Now we need money for research, and I am going to stay awake, as long as it takes, to convince you to make a donation Let's do this, guys.

Uh, thanks for calling back. Let me, uh, let me get your name and number in case we get disconnected again. You are going to reach for something. - Right, Rick? - Yeah, man, I'm reaching. You, uh, you mentioned the doctor before. - The doctor that... - You've got to give them more substance than sensation. Honestly convey your passion to your listeners. Uh-huh. You're right. The human element. So with you. So, tell me, you... Stop yessing me, Weider! You're not expecting enough from your listeners! You have no idea what they're capable of if they can believe in you. Be real! Be honest! They will rise up in solidarity with our cause, and we will triumph! Do not blow this! Dude. What the hell was that? Ah, he was just a prank caller. I take back what I said. This will be over by lunch. Rick. Rick? Rick! Um, this is Dr. Gray, the SMA expert. Hello, doctor. Welcome. I'm moving out of SMA into other fields of research. Oh. Oh, that's a shame. Joining me once again is Dr. Gray, who has been illuminating us on the subject of SMA. So, Dr. Gray, tell us more about the, the challenges of dealing with this deadly disease. The families must face difficult lifestyle decisions, uh, in order to make life manageable for their children, and... of course, the specter of death is always a burden to bear. Intricate stuff. Prognosis is tricky. Time-cost issues, parental expectations... For, for tangible results. Ta... Tangible results? To save a life. We need to find a cure. Uh, and you think Dr. Rance was making headway? I mean, he died so suddenly. Were, were you working with him toward that tangible result? That's a... That's difficult to go... ...to go into. Oh, uh, we'll... we'll be right back. I'm terribly sorry. I'm terribly sorry. Don't worry, man. It's radio. No one saw it. Yeah, um... I've, uh... I've been under... tremendous stress. - Pharmacy is two blocks down. - Oh, okay. I've, uh... I've been getting these... these terrible threats. That was... disgusting. Smile. It's for charity. WZLW Rick Weider. "Tangible result"? I'll give you a tangible result. He doesn't look healthy enough-It's that guy. to live anyway. - What? - Yeah. You see him now? He definitely doesn't look like he's gonna make it. You gonna threaten one of my guests now? Call this a lesson in dedication. You're not gonna do anything. You're just another media-crazy, celebrity ballbuster. - Get a life. - Like Gray's? And when I'm finished busting, Rick, you'll be a star. Go find Gray. Now. - Okay? - What? - He's going to the pharmacy. Go! - What's going on? Just please! - Tell me what's going on. - Please go find Gray now! Go! Go! Okay, jokes over. Knock it off, or I'm calling the police. Better call the morgue. Charlene, do you see him? Not yet. What's going on? Wait, look. I don't know what you're after, but this isn't helping your kid, okay? Look, you hear me? I said this isn't helping. She died. She died. Charlene, what's happening? I'm looking. Come on, Charlene. Give me something. Uh, yeah. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, god, Rick. Oh, god. No. He's... He's dead, Rick. He's dead! He's dead. He's dead! Message received? You killed him? You killed him for a radio show? Five million. You're going to raise five million dollars before you fall asleep. Not 20,000. Not a hundred thousand. Five million dollars, or you're next. You're insane. Five million dollars before you sleep. Or you will never... wake up. Wait. Wait, that's impossible. It, it can't be done. Look, Rick, you can't... You can't stay awake until we raise five million... Five million. What am I gonna do, huh? If I fall asleep, he's gonna kill me. I have to break the record. Okay, okay. Say that you do break it... ...there's no guarantee you're gonna raise that much money. I mean, it's not even possible to go 11 days. No? Tell her, Falco. Tell her. But if you could get past 11 days and break the record, the research data alone would be invaluable. Research data. Great. Shit. Nice cage. But your ratings, they haven't improved, and... you've got a dead guest. You really think you're gonna raise five million dollars with this sideshow? Do you? Money will pour in.

You're not telling the dollar amounts. How much have you raised? Uh... So... What do I call you? We started this with a quote from Robert Browning. Leave it at that. Okay. Okay, Browning. Browning. Do you think Dr. Gray was wondering, "What's a heaven for?" Gray was a selfish little sponge soaking up perks from the drug companies. I have bigger plans for you, Rick. You want me to be real for my audience, huh? Why don't you be real with them? Come on the show, and, uh, tell us your story. Inspire us with your dedication that killed doctors to make them find a cure faster or whatever the hell it is you're doing. Five million dollars before you sleep. Hey, look, look, look, Browning. Um, your, your daughter died, and... and now you wanna help others. I, I get that, but... Rick. Rick! You're on! Rick, you're on. Oh. All right, this is The Rick Weider Show, and we're rocking to find a cure for SMA, and, uh, and to stay awake. Are you okay? I've been trying to get you for two days. Detective Murdoch. Your killer just threatened me again. To, to murder me if, if I don't raise millions before I sleep. A murderer? Oh. That's a great hook. Grab your audience, reel 'em in. Hey, hey, hey. Do I look like I'm making this up? Why would someone wanna kill the doctor? I don't know. How the hell should I know? Um, maybe, maybe, uh... Maybe he knew too much. About what? About him. Him, the files. Files or something. Files, files that... can link him to the first murder, and so, he kills him. With a poisoned syringe? The first doctor had his intestines hanging over the East River. That's an entirely different MO. So what? How many phone calls did you receive from this, um, supposed killer? Um... I don't know, three? No. No, four. When was the first call? About, uh... About a week ago. When did he reveal to you that he killed the first doctor? The first call... So you knew days ahead of this, this Wake-A-Thon that this guy was the killer. I might have tried to reel him in myself, and that was stupid. Stupid. And now he's... He's killed Gray, and he's set on killing me. That is not a hoax. So you've gotta do something. Police work isn't done in front of your microphone. For the last two days, I've taken statements from his associates, searched their offices. I even had an autopsy done on Dr. Gray. He died... of a heart attack. A heart attack? No. For SMA. Have a nice day. Rick? Psst. Rick. Ricky boy. Oh, Rick. From your throat... Rick. Rick. Oh, Ricky boy. Oh, Rick. Hey. Down here. Hi, pal. Wow, you certainly look like hell. You don't really think you're going to break the record, do you? Eleven days. That would be something. You're a loser, though. So, no chance. Hey, guess what? I've got a hot date with your wife tonight. I mean, with you being such a dud, she'll come running into my big beautiful arms. "Mantis, love." - Stop talking to me, okay? - Ooh. - Stop talking to me. - She's going to... - Stop talking to me, okay? - love it, love it. Love it! - Shut up. - Hey. Do you see that, chap? What's he doing out there? - What? - Strange. Hey, this is Kathy. Leave a message. Kathy. Darling, you're... You're my bride, and you're the... You're the most important thing in the world to me. It's... I'm not gonna let anything... come between us. I'm not, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just, I'm just sitting here, uh... hoping that... Rick Weider. I miss her. I miss my little girl. How'd you find my cell number? It's not that hard. Smart guy, huh? You can make a murder look like a heart attack, too. Necessity, mother of invention. You're a loser, Weider. I popped by earlier. You sounded terrible, so I figured I should check on my investment. How old was she? I said, how old was your daughter when she died? I don't wanna talk about her, - circus boy. - What was her name? None of your business! You gotta give me something, okay? People are telling me you're a hoax. - You know better. - I know squat! I just, I just... I need a human face, man. She's not your poster child. What's the investment for? Who are we fighting for? Who are we fighting for? Who are we fighting for? Clarissa. Got you, you bastard. - What the hell's going on? - Clarissa. Her name is Clarissa. Clarissa? I need to speak to Detective Murdoch. This is an emergency. All right. What is this, this emergency you're going on about? What? Are you having a heart attack, too? You wanted evidence, Murdoch? Now, I got you evidence. You gotta be kidding me. Browning's daughter's name... - is Clarissa. - Clarissa? - I think it was Cla... Clarissa. - Clarissa. I got that out of him while you were... looking for donuts up your ass. Is that right? So, all you gotta do is, uh... is you gotta find... ...Clarissa, who died of SMA on the list. And, uh, that'll get you her last name. And then, and you trace it - to the killer. Simple. - Dr. Rance and Dr. Gray's deaths are unrelated. Deal with it. The idea that a murderer is gonna call you and offer you evidence - is absurd. - Listen! No, you listen! You use me again... to boost your dog and pony show, and I'll arrest you. You better take his, uh, blood pressure again, doc. Sorry, Rick. Cops, huh? Now, now you're a doctor. Why don't you find me... Gray's list? You may as well ask me to steal gold from Fort Knox. Clarissa! "A man's reach should always exceed his grasp." "Or what's a heaven for?" Clarissa! You need to have a bigger vision for this, Weider. They can believe in you, Weider. They can believe in you... Why, Weider? Oh, damn it. What? She is not on the list. What list? What are you talking about? Didn't I tell you I... I got ahold of Gray's SMA list? What? You, you said it was Fort Knox. Turns out it wasn't so hard. Had a friend of mine... ...hack it. What's on it? This... is a registry of every single child who's died from SMA in the last 30 years. I've scanned every single name. No Clarissa. No Clarissa? Wait. Are you tell... Are you telling me that there's no Clarissa who died of SMA? Clarissa, Clarissa, Clarissa. Clarissa had the disease. She, she... She died tragically. Poor thing, and, uh... And, uh, and then maybe your kids... knew her, you know, or, or the family from, uh... Uh... If, uh, you could give us a ring, we would love to hear from you. Mm, what... What are you doing here? The marriage retreat starts today. Remember? I've got a car outside. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Marriage retreat. Okay, okay. Yeah. You look like you need a rest. Yeah, sure. Well, but wait a minute. You want me to walk outta here, and, uh... go to some retreat with you? But it's... Fuck, Rick. You've had a good run here, okay? I'm sure your ratings have improved. Now just... come with me. Do the right thing. - Come with me. - You don't understand. If I walk, if I walk out of here, it's... Someone is going to kill me. Okay, you know what? I understand you're exhausted. I understand where your paranoia is... I am not paranoid, okay? Someone is actually going to kill me. Okay. Listen, okay? You either come with me and you save our marriage or we're through. Why can't you just help me for once? Help you for once? These last nine years haven't been me helping you, me by your side, Rick? You think you'd be here without me, and now, here I am trying to save our marriage, and you can't. You want my help now with your precious ratings, Rick? - Yeah, that's what I want. - Yeah? Then how about you and me - right now? - Mm. What? Yeah. Let's make the front page of the news. - Oh, I can't, I can't do that. - Yeah, you can. Hmm. - What the hell? - Yeah? - No. - Yeah? Come on. Mm, right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. No, I'd, I'd fall asleep afterwards, you know? Oh, come on, baby. Do it for your ratings! No, no. This is my show. Okay? I call the shots. This is... I do things my way. Do you understand this? Do you? Kathy. Kathy! Kathy. - We can wake... - Wake up! - Come on, Rick. - Wake up! I'm here. Can you even hear me, Rick? Talk to me. Please. Talk to me, Rick. It's intriguing just to... watch the human brain do its thing. Look, you've gotta give me something. Like, uh... speed or, like, smelling salts. Cocaine. I just... I just... I need drugs. I do happen... to have an old formula. It's... not exactly FDA approved, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Always the easy way, huh, Rick? I'm not dead yet, you tool. Dude, I'm taking your spot, so I don't know why you're doing all this crazy stuff. I'm taking your spot. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blah, blah. - Yeah, it's mine. - You're not getting my slot. - Your slot's mine. - Now come on. Calm down. - The spot's mine, dude. - Get away! - No, don't touch me, dude. - Get away. Get away from me. - You're losing your mind. Get away from my booth. Get away from my booth. Get away from my booth! - No, no, no. Calm down. - You're scaring the children. Get away! Scaring the children. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Hey. Rick, what's... going on? Are you okay? Stay awake, Rick. Come on, I know you can. Wake up, young man! Wake up! Wake up, young man! And you... This one's gonna be you, Browning. I'll find you. This is you. I know this... - This one's gotta be you. - Hello? Hello, yes. Yes, I got your, um... I got your number from an SMA registry. And there's, uh... - There's no Clarissa on it. - What? So maybe they changed the name. - What are you talking about? - Huh? Is your daughter Clarissa? - What? Get lost. - I know it's you, Browning. - Browning. Browning! - Go to hell. Shit! Stay awake, Rick. Stay... Stay awake. That clock's not right, is it? What do you mean? It was... It's 135 hours. You trying to screw with me, dude? No, why would I do that? You're changing clock times now. - No, I promise you. Why... - You're, like, getting really helpful, Miguel. - Why would I do that? - Thanks, dude. What's going on, man? - I'm so fucking sorry. - Oh, you know what? - I'm fucking sorry. - What's goin' on, man? I'm sorry. Hey, what do we have? I was talking to the preacher... He's giving stupid, mean-spirited assistance. - What the hell? - I don't know, Rick. - What is going on? - What is this about? - What happened to him? - This is unbelievable! - Rick, just... - Dude. What's going on? - I gotta call her. Get off me! - Who are you calling? - Who are you calling? - You need to just calm down. Relax. Have you eaten? Did he eat? - He drank. He, he... - Has he eaten something? Is Kathy there? Who is he calling? If she, you know... Wait, wait. Is, um... Okay, when, when she gets back, well, it's me again. So, when she gets back, she can... It's okay. Never mind. I'm gonna try again at five. - Okay? Yeah. - Are you feeling... Are you feeling, like, anxious? What happened? Did something happen? - I can't do this. - Yes, you can. You can do this. You can do this. Yeah... - I gotta get out... - I promise you, - I'll get you something. - You guys like salsa? - I'm not hungry right now. - Yeah, I love salsa. Yes. - Rick. - Salsa. Salsa, salsa, salsa. - Salsa. - Do you know what time it is? Salsa! - He's here. - What? - Browning. - What? - Do you see him? - I can't hear - what you're saying. He's not... - He's here! Browning! - It's Browning! - Rick, come back! Rick! Ooh! Ooh! Oh, man, Rick. That was... That was awesome. We are in the footsteps of Edison. Thomas Edison. He... He fought to eradicate sleep. He was a raging, driven man. Didn't win, but he contributed. Gave us the electric light bulb to find our way through the darkness. Man, do you even have a license? For whatever it is that you do? Over to you, Miguel. Call me if you need me. Goodnight, sweet prince. It was Tesla, by the way. That's strange. Isn't that the exact same amount of money we had four hours ago? What? What are you talking about? No, I'm just saying that it's kinda weird that not a single person has given us a dollar since. Should I wake her up? It's gotta wake her up, or I'm gonna try to do it myself. Just like last summer. I need her help. - Hello? - Uh, yeah, Charlene. - Um... - Is everything okay? Yeah. Something's gone, uh, wonky with the board. - Oh, my god. - I need you to, um... to check the total at the source. Check the total at the source. Okay, hang on. Log in. Okay. Uh... Monitor's... all right. Oh, boy. Charlene, are you there? Oh, my god. - Oh, my god. - What? What's going on? It's gone. What? What's gone? - It's all gone. - What's all gone? The money! The... The, uh, account. The... The pledges are, uh, empty. Zero. What the hell is happening? I saw you. You're out there. So, what are you gonna tell your wife about that coed you were dancing with? You're a good liar. No, you're the liar, Browning. No Clarissa died from SMA in the past 30 years. Do you... Do you even have a daughter? Huh? Just put her on the phone. Are you finished? Hey, listen. Listen, about this, uh, arbitrary five million, uh. Let's, uh... Let's make it half a million. Still a lot of money, huh? You're in no position to negotiate. Shit. Rick. I'm dead. There's no way I can raise this money now. Rick, the money's been stolen. We have to call the police. No. No, the word will get out. Whoever took the money had to be someone who could get in. Like who? What if Browning took the money? No, no. Browning wouldn't, wouldn't screw over SMA. No, hear me out. There is no Clarissa. Dr. Gray, he died of a heart attack. This guy isn't a murderer. He's an opportunist. He was just looking for the biggest pot of money he could find. No, no, no. Browning didn't, didn't know about the money. On the phone, he... He didn't know what I was talking about. Someone else. If we can't find the money, it's... I'm dead. Breathe. Look, look at me, look at me, look at me. Just breathe. Relax. Relax. Rick, Rick. - Shut up! - Rick, listen to me, man. You're not well, huh? Let's get you to the medical room, we'll run some tests. No, I'm not leaving. No, no, he's out there! I can't leave. I can't cross that street. He's out there! Okay, yeah, I need that stuff. We got that stronger stuff that you were talking about? I need it now. Now! Get it, get it. Get it. Now. Come with me and you save our marriage, or we're through! We're through! They're not the problem. You are. You are. - What ya lookin' at? - They're not the problem. - We're through! - You are. Clarissa. We're through! - Clarissa. - You are. Larabee. They're not the problem. - Clarissa. - You are. You are. - You are. You are. - Top down. Top down. Rick. Top down. Larabee. Holy shit. He took it. He took the money. Larabee took it. This should do the trick. This should do the trick. You be, uh, careful though. This is potent stuff. Rick? - Teresa, Teresa. - Hi. Come here.

Happy now? Go. Go, go. - Oh, yeah. - Tell Charlene I did it. Rick Weider. Yeah. Hi, Rick. Uh, Roy Angstrom from The Daily News. I have it from a confidential source that the money you're raising in the Wake-A-Thon has gone missing. Would, uh... Would you care to comment? Uh, what? Uh... Uh, who, who told you that? It's, uh... It's, uh... Rick, you sound upset. Are you confirming? Uh, no, I got it. I got it. I... I mean, I got it under control. All right? It's, uh... Huh? So, the money for the dying kids, it's, it's all there, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yes. I mean, yeah. Yeah. You sound very nervous, Rick. You sure you're telling the truth? You okay with us looking at your financial statements? Uh... Rick, Rick, Rick. Rick, Rick. Oh, my. Look at you, my boy. What a mess you're in! It's all your fault, you know? Your lack of talent. Your worthlessness. - Worthlessness. - No. Oh, yes. There's no denying it. You know that. Why don't you just give up and be done with it? What chance do you really have? Zippo. I can do this. Can't I? No, you can't. You're a failure. No one cares. Just die already. ♪ I lay my life down ♪ I lay my life down ♪ It's you, my love ♪ It's you, my love I can't live without ♪ Good... Good morning. Morning, New York. This is, uh... the seventh day. Seven days awake. Wide, wide awake. You know, they... They tell us that God created the world... in six days, and then... rested on the seventh. Well, God... God may have taken a little nap on, uh, on the seventh day, but... not me, I'm still going. Still... Still fighting. Still awake. I can't rest. I can't rest, won't rest. I can't rest, won't rest till... Until we get those five million... dollars. Thousands of children, dying children are waiting for... for your help before they die. And then, the parents are left to cry their eyes out... until they die. The worst... part... about having to stay awake day after day after day, after day, after day... is having to have to spend every waking... waking minute with your... horrible self. You've got to face everything rotten, sordid, every miserable thing wrong with you. And just when you've had enough, and you can't... you can't stand the wretched sight anymore, you just... you just wanna put your head down and fall asleep, and... dream, just dream. Dream about all the little things that make you happy. But you've gotta stay awake until you've got five million dollars. Come on, buddy, you can do it! I'll rest when we get the five million. So, give it to me, New York. So I can dream again. Rick. Uh, I, I... I've been trying to reach you, Kath. Honey, so... so much is going on, and I can't trust anybody but you. Rick. I can't. Honey, I need you, to, to help me fight this through. Yeah. But they're not listening to me. No matter what I do, they just still don't listen. I saw a divorce lawyer this morning. What? When I heard you on the radio, I always thought that you just loved yourself more than anything. But that's not true, is it? You hate yourself. And you always have. And if you can't love you, then, well, you're sure as hell never gonna be able to love me. Don't. I want a divorce. Whoa! Good, this is radio. It stinks in here! - Get out. - You okay? Get out. - You okay? - Get out. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey! - Get out. - I'm out of here. - Get out! I'm going, I'm going! Help me. You can do this, Rick. You can do this. You're doing it, Rick. You're doing a great job. You're gonna stay awake. You're gonna break the record. Keep going. Wake up, sleepyhead. I believe in you, sweetheart. Good job, darling. Keep it up. You are the best, Rick. You are a radio god. You are a radio god. You are a radio god. You are a radio god. You are a radio god. Rick. You are a radio god. Rick, you are a radio god. - Rick, come on! - Stay awake. Come on. - You're on the air. We're live! - Stay awake. Stay awake. - Stay awake. - You got this. - Come on, get up! - You can do this. - Yes! Yes! - Come on. Come on. - You can do this. - Oh, my god. Come on, come on. - Yes! Yes, yes, yes! - Yes! Put it back. WZLW, Rick Weider. - We are back. - Yep. Against, uh, against all odds, for the cause of the eradication of SMA. - Mm-hm. - Good job. I'm still awake. This is day... Hey, hey, what day is it? Day eight. - Eight? - It's eight. Holy... how'd we do that? What do these kids with SMA do? Or their parents? - They're counting on you. - We've got to prevail. - The rage... - Yes. against the dying of the light! - Yes! - Yeah! - We must prevail! - Yes! - So, send your money in. - Mm-hm. And, uh, let's just give these kids a fighting chance. Do it. Do it. Do it while, while there's still time. Mm-hm. Do it. Yes. Great job, buddy. You're back. Oh! Oh! - Okay. - You're gonna be fine. You got it. Hey, I just got a call from POSMA. Have you been making obscene phone calls? - POSMA? - People of SMA. It's a support group for parents. They're complaining that somebody is calling them in the middle of the night, asking if their kids are still dead. You know, Browning's one of them. I know it. Look, Rick. These people have lost a lot. You have got to be sensitive to that. Why is that? Why isn't Clarissa on this list? He told me she died. She should be on it. Well, maybe she... died of something else. - Sign up here. Help find a cure. - SMA pledge. Come here. Hey, you know, I was thinking, um... You know, I heard about this place downtown. - Yeah. - Uh... It's a cool, like, dinner, like underground vibe. They have, like, jazz bands. And I was thinking, you know, maybe if you're not doing anything later... Um... No. I... I have a lot of work to do, actually. I have a midterm on Monday, - and... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, maybe some other time? - Yeah, yeah, okay. - Yeah. Pledges! And we're back with Nancy Turner who, uh... tragically lost a daughter to SMA. So, um, tell us... tell us, Nancy, about, um... about the final days. Megan, she could... she, um... she couldn't do anything. The process was long and difficult for all of us. She was so, so brave. Yeah. Ooh, that must have been real hard. Well, she died in her sleep. I was glad for that. I'd kill to die in my sleep. Oh, my. You have had a time of it. I should have brought you some soup. Soup? I mean, you want me to drown or something? I know that we gotta... we gotta think of these things going in. It's like having children. You know, there's a risk there. A risk worth taking. Yeah, that's what they say, you know. What, uh, whatever comes, you accept the responsibility. Life is in God's hands. God? God isn't raising money for SMA research. I am. God... God isn't... didn't ultimately help your kid from dying. Let's face it. When push came to shove, you... you didn't take her to... to a healer, you took her to a doctor. She... She's in heaven now. And, uh... So tell me, tell me. Did you, uh, did you donate the kid's brains? What? Or did you just store her in the ground where she's no use to anybody? How dare you? - Please, I am so sorry. - No. I, I didn't... Well, that went better than expected, didn't it? - Charlene! - I don't care how tired you are, - you self-serving monster! - Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Charlene, okay. It's... It's not his fault. Okay? He's just tired. - He's really, really tired. - Yeah, I'm just really tired. - Yeah, he's tired. - He's really tired! He's really tired. - It's okay. Oh! - I'm tired. Yeah, it's okay. - Oh, my god. - Oh, please! Oh, my god. I've had it! It's okay. Great. Yeah, yeah. It's okay. Just go, go get coffee. Yeah. Abusing a guest? Get control of yourself. The lady, she lost a child, too. But she isn't here threatening me. I won't be a martyr for you. For SMA. Or for anyone else. Oh, you might. The DJ dies for SMA research. And five million will be a drop in the bucket. And I win, and you'll be damned. No. Damn you. Damn you. This... whole thing's cost me my marriage, my job. I have nothing. You? I lost everything! My wife left me when my Clarissa died. I... I cared for her. More than my own health! I, I trudged through the snow with her in my arms, to get her to the emergency room, because 911 wasn't responding! Those five million bucks won't... won't settle your grief. Come on, come on. What the hell? Psst, hey. Yes, I'm back. Listen. Listen carefully. Look at her. Look at that slut. She cooked up this plot against you. It's her and Larabee. They're in this together. Did you ever think about that? That moron Larabee, he's out to get you. He's gonna take your job away. It's really her that set this whole thing up. Ooh, wouldn't you just like to put your hands around her throat and crush that windpipe of hers? Oh, yes. Look, Rick. I'm sorry about yesterday. I guess I'm pretty tired myself. You found your comfort, haven't you? Oh, you disgust me! You need to up your dosage. I saw you kissing him. You're on his side, aren't you? Why... Why him? You think you're the only one whose job is on the line? Oh, Charlene. I begged him not to fire you! But he doesn't seem to have a problem with you now. He thinks you'll actually break the record. He doesn't have a problem now? That's 'cause he's got the money. Don't make any more trouble for yourself. Your new boyfriend Larabee is a sharp customer. Just get him over here tonight. I... I'm gonna trip him up in a subtle way that he... he can't see coming. Huh? Give me the money, you prick. Give it to me or I'll kill you! Get off me, you maniac! - You won't get away with it. - What money? I'll take you down. I'll make sure he gets you, too. You mean the SMA money? It's gone. That's it. I'm pulling the plug on this sham. You're done. Wait. Please, please, please, hold on. Wait, wait, look at me. Um... I need you to get me the money back, okay? 'Cause I wanna live. So, look, I'll, uh... I'll do anything. I'll play Top 40. See, I love these stuff. ♪ Baby, baby, wait, wait, wait ♪ Baby, melt your broken heart - ♪ Baby, I'll - What the hell's going on - in here? - ♪ I'll You're one pathetic bastard. You're not taking me off the air. You do that, and everyone will find out about the kickbacks you're getting from record companies to play your precious Top 40. That's very funny. How'd you know he's getting kickbacks? He's getting kickbacks? You just said he was! What? Oh, yeah. I... I was bluffing. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick! Rick? I think the pills are kicking in. He's technically awake, right? Technically? The machine is registering REM. It's a dream phase. - Rick. - Look at him. Rapid eye movement. He's crossed a very dangerous threshold. We've pushed him too far. We should let him drift off to sleep. No. No. Rick, forget about it. It's not safe. Man, I wanted the glory of this as much as you, but I can't let you go on with this. Now come on, Rick. You could get permanent brain damage. Rick? Who you calling "Rick"? Rick... Can't you see? I'm an imposter. What have you done with the real Rick? Where is he? Rick? I'm a fake. - I'm an imposter. - Rick, Rick, listen to me. You're not in control of yourself anymore. It's too risky. I will not... I will not give up. Listen to me. If you lose enough sleep, you will die. I will not give up. And you know what will finally kill you? - You'll freeze to death. - Huh? The human body has an internal thermostat that regulates our body temperature. When you lose enough sleep, your body temperature drops, and then you effectively freeze to death, that's if your brain doesn't hemorrhage first. What? Freeze to... Freeze... What do you mean "freeze to death"? Well, even in 100-degree weather, that's what will kill him. Do you notice how cold you get when you're tired? When his internal thermostat goes kaput, he will go into hypothermia. And then... And I have videotape of lab rats that'll make your skin crawl. Look at him. Like all warm-blooded creatures, he's instinctively gorging on food to try and raise his body temperature when he's so cold inside. Mm. - Rick. - Mm-hmm. I wanted you to break that record. But I'm your doctor first. I told you, I'm not Rick. I'm an imposter. I have to find Rick. I have to find Rick. Damn it, Phil. Grab him! Uh, we're... we're here with Brett, and, uh... his... his parents. Brett is 12. And he's... he's known SMA... all his life. I, I bet that's... difficult. Yes. Yes. Do you... Do you know of, uh... any children that have already... gone? Yes. Yes. Did... Did you know Clarissa? I don't think so. Oh... okay. We, uh... I... I know that the... There... is there, uh, any... anything, money, whatever, any... anything that, that... that we can do? We really need a cure. A cure, folks. You heard that. Uh... We are... are still way under our, our five-million-dollar goal. And, uh, there is... there isn't enough time in the world to... to help these children. So we need to develop a cure. Uh, Brett, is, is there... any... anything else that... you wanna say? Never give up. Never. Never. Hey, Rick, you all right? You all right? Listen. I need to tell you something. Well, sure. What is it? I've seen something. It's just something... What did you see? I've seen... God. I understand. The synapses in your brain are doing strange things right now. You'll be fine. - It's gonna be okay. - No, no, no. It's real. It's more than real. It's... I'm seeing things clearly now. And it's... beautiful. I've looked into eternity. And He told me... that I'm the chosen one. A beacon. Beacon. Beacon for hope and light. Look at all the faces of those people out there. I can hear their souls. And they're crying out... for help. That's what I'm... That's what I'm doing in here. They need to know that... they can endure. What you need is a cup of coffee. I love you, man. I love you. - Mm. - Coffee. - Rick? - Kathy. Kathy, I'm a beacon. What were you gonna do, Rick? Just fake your own death and skip town? Huh? Fake? What? Embezzlement, Rick? Embezzlement? You bastard! I mean, to put all that money that you stole in our account. I mean, how could you drag me into this? Are you kidding me? I mean, I knew you were a selfish jerk. - This is... This is crazy. - But I had no idea - that you were a thief! - Um, I'm checking our account. The press has our bank statements. They are harassing me, Rick! They are calling me, and they know, okay? They know. What the hell are you doing? Are you giving it to them? Holy shit. Password. What the hell are you doing over there? Radio god. How could you be so dumb to put it in our account? Oh, no, no. No, no, no! Son of a bitch. What the hell's going on? Must be this, Rick. Hello? Hey, what's up, Cliff? Cliff? - I've been set up. - Relax, Rick. I've already got the FCC breathing down my neck. Don't... Don't pull the plug, Cliff. We'll, uh, we'll still raise the five million. Enough! Don't say anymore! We could lose our license over this. Don't you dare! No! See you later... radio god. - Look. Hey. - You ruined it. - Listen, Browning. - You ruined it! We can finish this. - You and I. - It's over. No, wait, wait, wait. Wait, let me fix this. - Let me fix... - You'll be dead in a few minutes. I'm coming for you. Right now. Marcus. Marcus, please. He's trying to kill me. It's Rick, it's Rick. He's trying to kill me. - Whoa. Slow down, Rick. - Now, could you help me, - Marcus? - What? Marcus, you have to put me on the air. Just go put me on the air. I, I, I... I can't die like this. I can't die like this. What are you talking about? Who's trying to kill you? Just put me on the air. It's not a hoax, believe me. - Believe me! - Dude. Dude, I can't. Man, I'll lose my job. Marcus, Marcus, whatever... whatever you thought about me... Yo, if... Listen, listen. If someone's trying to kill you, why don't you call the police? - Why're you calling me? - Put me on the air. Just tell Charlene... Tell Charlene to just call Murdoch and listen in. Dude, I can't put you on, dude! Oh, shit. He's calling. I'll... I'll conference call him. I'll conference call him, and... and you can hear it for yourself. Okay? We're gonna catch him together. Put me on the air! Browning. Where do you think you're running to, Rick? Nowhere to go. Fuck. The following is Rick Weider, WZLW Radio. You're about to hear radio history in the making. Browning, Browning, you've got to listen to me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. It was Phil. It was... It was the intern, Phil. That prick. He... He... He stole the money, and he put it in my account. It was him. Always blaming someone else. - Get off me, man. - You knew my password. And you transferred the money into my account. You called the newspaper. You set me up. The show is over, Rick. Give it up. Phil took the money. Tell him. Bastard! Rick, what's happening, dude? Hey, hold on. Hold on, hold on. What are you doing in here? What are you guys doing? He's after us. Shut up! This is all your fault! - We're closed. - Do not listen to this, - this selfish son of a bitch. - I'm doing this charity thing at the moment. You want to get a job? I can give you a very nice job. Please, I'll give you all the money in the world. Please, please help me. What's going on? Son of a bitch. I'm doing this charity thing. I will give you lots of money. We're closed, and you need to leave. He's there! He's there! Oh, my god. Did he just get shot? Marcus. He's okay. He's okay. - Yeah, 1-30-43, 1-30-43. - Go, come on. Come on. 1-30-43. "1-30-43." What is he talking about? Wait, wait, wait. I think he's trying to give us an address. You took the money from dying kids. Just shut up and give me the phone! No. I was just out to raise my numbers. Steve Larabee. Dang him. I sat out there, so he could play his Top 40. Anything, so long as the numbers go up. Right, Phil? I don't know anything! No. It had to be you. And Larabee. Larabee's got his payoffs. From the record companies. No, no, no. Get him off the air. - Get him off... - No, no, it's breaking news. - Go to commercial. - It's breaking news. You cut into commercial. Move! It's breaking news, man! - I don't care if it's... - He stays on! He stays on! - It's my show. He stays on! - What he's saying... - He's lying. Nothing... - No, no, no. - that he's saying in there... - Rick stays on! - No, he's getting off! He's off! - Rick is staying on! - You're fired! - Rick's staying on. - I don't give a damn! - You're fired! - You're getting off. - I don't care. - He's staying on now, though. - You will never work - at another radio station - Whatever, man. - in this country again. - Whatever. We're tired of you - anyway. - Enjoy unemployment. I'm tired of your crap anyway. Bitch! What's your cut, Phil? What's he paying you? Huh? What did I ever do to you, except take your lousy bets? You deserved this, Weider. You're screwing everyone over just as you please. Hey! Hey! Get your pencil-pushing ass out of my station! Or I will bring down an investigation on you so hard, you will never work in this industry again. And Rick goes back on the air. Oh, god. This wasn't even about you and Larabee embezzling, was it? It couldn't be. The money is in my account. Why? This was just about taking me down. Why? Why? For Teresa. What? She couldn't see me with you there. - I tried so hard. - What? No. No, no, no. You're not so hot now, are you, Rick? It can't be. Seriously? Oh, my god. Who the hell is Teresa? You did this for a girl? Why didn't you just buy her flowers, you dumb son of a bitch? Morning man Rick Weider is in the clutches of a deadly attacker. You are listening to him via his cell phone. This is real, people. This is happening right now. He's gone. I'm out of here. Later, loser. Phil, run! Oh, god. Oh, god. This is live, people. This is not a game. His life is in jeopardy. He is in the clutches of a deadly attacker. No. No. Wait. Wait. Wait. Uh, wait. - You failed. - Wait. You failed! You failed! You failed! God, no. No. - No. - You failed. You failed! Oh. - Still breathing. - We have one down. Roll EMS. How about... How about Clarissa? Is... Is this what she wanted? How about... Clarissa? Clarissa. Clarissa... is that what she wanted? You don't know the pressure. The doctors. The constant whining. Crying. Excuses. She'd be finishing college now. My little girl. My little girl. She didn't die of SMA, did she? That's why she wasn't on the list. Oh, is this... Is this how she died? You did it, didn't you? You murdered your own daughter. She was suffering. No. No, you were suffering. You were suffering. And you couldn't take it anymore. And you killed her. You gave up on her. You gave up on her! - You did. You gave up on her... - You don't know! You don't know what it's like... to look at all the other kids, and see them, and how happy they are! And you were weak. And you killed... Clarissa. She was six, and I was giving her a bath. And I pushed her head under the water. I pushed her head under the water. But I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. We can do it. Together, we can raise the money. We can still raise the money. For the kids. We can still do it. We don't have to stop. Together. You have to die. You need to die. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Kathy. Kathy. I love you, Kathy. Kathy. I love you, Kathy. Come on, asshole... and kill me. Hey, hey! Hey, take the money! Hey, take the money! For the kids. It's great publicity. Let's do it.
