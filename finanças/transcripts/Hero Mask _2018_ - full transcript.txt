I've been expecting your call. Yes, there's no need to worry. I have them standing by. Consider it done. FIERCE Time to work. I have a feeling it's going to be a long night. Wait. It'll only activate for residents. Can you do something? Just ask for a key from the front desk. Looks like they're gone. Yeah. Made it. This is everything...? Yes. Masks... I'd like to discuss... our next move. Hey! What's wrong? Hey, no more shooting doors open! I'll try the front desk again. Hey, James-- Hello? I'd like to ask you to come in at the end. The LIVE Corporation. -Eddy? -Yeah. I'm the one who called you earlier. What's going on? Anna? Yes. Anna Winehouse. The current president of Ecohes. Ecohes? James followed the clues from Fred's house, and they led him to her. It seems they both started off at the same lab. Anna? Anna Winehouse. I'll send you a quick summary. Wait a second... Hey. What's gotten into you? Hey. Calm down! Hey. Come on. Will you cut it out? Hello? What is it, Sarah? -Sarah. -Hold on! That's right. Monica was in charge... of a case involving Ecohes not long ago. It's Sarah. Ecohes. Ecohes. I remember. One time, Monica mentioned she was invited to Ecohes for a function. What? Then does that mean...? The link between Fred and Monica. Fred and Anna once worked at the same lab. And they're still friends. Monica met Fred at this function. Through Anna. And Fred... reached out to Monica. If... the two of them never met... Sarah. I know. I know. I'm okay. I'm sorry, I will call you back later. Please let me know if you learn anything about Fred. Sarah! James! Eddy! Switch over my contacts! Okay, switching modes! Thanks. Damn it. I'm over here. Eddy. I'm heading over there. Okay, I'll arrange for backup. What a mess. Well, it's part of the job. Who is he? The SSC. They'll likely take Fred into custody. I don't care where he ends up as long as he's safe. I always had a soft spot when it comes to my brother. I rather liked this laboratory. Would you indulge me? There's something I need to get before we leave here. Let me show you something. What is that? Could you explain how your military projects and humanitarian efforts coexist? Because they are both founded on technology. Could you comment on the allegations against you? Wait! Please-- Don't miss the next one. I've secured the intruders. We can look into them later. I found Fred. Fred? Yes. He's unconscious, but it's nothing serious. I'll be there soon. Understood. Jeez. Time for a nap, huh? Well, I'm glad your owner's safe now.
