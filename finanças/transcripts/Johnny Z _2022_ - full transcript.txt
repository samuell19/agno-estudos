Warning. - He was headed for general population, sir. - Your orders were a lie! Take off the mask. - Orders, sir? Sir! - Mr. Clark will brief you. - Sorry, sir. We're on lockdown. Please unlock the doors. - Of course. - I need a scan and search on Dr. Fisher. - Copy that. - I'm sorry. - Dr. Fisher did this? - Yes, sir. Sarin gas. Dead within seconds. It wasn't pretty, sir. - He worked on Patient Z for nearly a decade, no? - Yes, sir. Level 10. Highest clearance. - But today, he decides to run off with my prime subject? Find out why. - Get away from the vehicle. Hands on your head. Turn around. Now take off your mask. - Get him to Dr. Lars. Please don't... His blood is the cure. He is the cure! - Ah. What the fuck, Jonray? I think I shit myself! - I thought it was locked. I need your help. What have you done this time brother? This time... This time you fucked up everything. I'm gonna go drink, to our last few hours alive. Why Jonray? - You owe me. - Owe you? For what? Pussy Fine then, do whatever you want to do. - Get rid of the jeep. They're probably tracking it. Clear up the tracks. Drive it to Beggar's Gulch and dump it in. - Beggar's Gulch? That's like 10 miles from here! - So? - So, how do I get back? - Run. - "Run." I can't make that run! You know I'm still carrying my winter weight! - Seriously Crisanto! How many winters is that? - That's cold. Even for you. - I looked through his journal. However, there's a few pages missing, so I don't have all his notes, but I believe he discovered a cure, using Patient Z's hemoglobin. - This is your important news? Z has already been a cure. - No. Sorry, my mistake. My fault. What I meant to say was that I believe he found a way to use Patient Z's blood as a permanent resistance to the radiation. - Get my nephew. - Jonray! Jonray! Jonray! - Run, my ass. - I needed that. What are you doing? Look at what's happening. What are we going to do? What have you got us into, Jonray? - I'm going to the Bubble. - Yeah, the Bubble. Good luck with that! Why are you going to do that? You're not going to talk to me? We're not going to talk about this? Everything that's going on. You're just going to stand there with the same fucking look as always. You won't look at me. You won't talk to me. Fine. Nothing? Go then. Yes. you can improve on something that is already perfect. Thank you Papa. Very good. Shut up, you. You're not getting outta there, zombie dude. You know, I haven't seen a zombie with just one white eye before. What's up with that? Fashion statement? I gotcha. Here. Try this. Beats all that human flesh you deaders like to munch on. Crisanto blend. Circa 2075. Most moonshine's clear. But mine is a special blend. Took me years of fine tuning. Ah, best within a hundred miles of Tugorios. That's right. I said it. Best. Looks and tastes. Ah. Like the finest whiskey you could ever imagine. If I do say so myself. Cheers. So... You're what a cure looks like? I think I'll stick to this! - Ooh-hoo-hoo! So close! So very close. So very, very close but not really. Really, really not that close. Jonray! My old friend. Well, let's not say friends. We are not friends. Let's not pretend we are friends. I respect you far too much to insult you like that. Let's say, my prize, my champion, my money-printing warrior. Hm? You're not here to make us some scratch, are you? I must admit, things are very good. Very, very good. Very, very, very good right now, as I'm sure you've seen. But you know me, Jonray. You know me very well. We used to be friends. We were very good friends. And you know me, you know I love money. I crave money. I... Can't seem to get enough money. So, what do you say? Let's make some money. - I need to find someone. And I know you know everyone. A scientist who goes by the name of Dr. Lars. - Oh? A doctor? You're not infected, are you, Jonray? Please, say it isn't so. Not my precious Jonray. Not my warrior, my champ, my champion. No one can touch you. But you know I can help. I can. I know everything. I know everyone. I know your doctor, and I can help. But it will cost you. Cost you money. Just a little, tiny payment. Just a little, little, little payment. I will make you a good deal. Bossman always gives the best deals. A tiny little payment and then I'll help my precious Jonray! Hm? Oh, what do we have here? This little man, this weak little man, so little, so, so weak. Surely he won't stand a chance against zombies! Strong, fierce zombies! They will kill him. Rip him apart. This little man. This little weak man. A fluke! A fluke! Lucky. The little man was lucky. Lucky, this little man was. A little too lucky. Surely there is no way this lucky, weak little man can do that twice. The zombies. They will tear him to pieces. Kill him, eat him. And mm, so good in the zombies' bellies, this little man will be. Now, shall we meet his opponent? Or shall we say opponents! - Yeah! Fuck him up! - Yes. He cheated! Well, he may have cheated. This little man. But Bossman can't prove it. Bossman is no judge. No one here is a judge. So, stop putting your unfair judgements on him. No one here can take away what this man, who Bossman doesn't know, has never met, has no idea who he is, has done. But just to be sure, let's bring out our fiercest competitors, shall we? Our champion zombie! So that Bossman can give some of this money back to you. My people. My loves. Because as you know, Bossman is all about his people. Loves his people. Wants to give back to his people. - Come on! - Come on! - Yes, yes, yes! Jonray! You did it, Jonray! I love you, Jonray. Oh, I would fuck Jonray. I'd let Jonray fuck me. I'm not gay. I love women. Women love Bossman. This steel-hard dick. This warrior's dick, this dick of the gods that no tainted pussy has ever taken down. But Jonray, mm, I would fuck Jonray. My champion. My warrior. My love. - And the address? - This address you seek. I can't give it to you. I never promised to. I never said I'd tell you where this person was. But wait, Jonray. I told you I would help you and I will. It's just, this person you seek, this doctor? She's a very important client of mine. Very important. And she's paid me very well. Very, very well, to stay hidden. But you know me to be a man of honor. I must honor my business deal with her, but I must also honor our business deal. I will do this, and I think you will find this fair, Jonray. I will tell her to seek you out. To come to you. I will insist. I will tell her, if she honors me, if she respects me, then she will speak with my good friend, Jonray, my warrior. She will do this. - Maybe this will help her decide. Tell her she has three days, or his time will expire. - I could easily get outta here, if I wanted to! But Jonray'd be pissed if I broke his hatch. I got some girls zombies down here! - The following is a test of emergency zombie broadcast system. It is only a test. I repeat. The following is a test of the emergency zombie broadcast system. It is only a test. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. This concludes this test of the emergency zombie broadcast system, brought to you by Nordak. Living solutions for a dying world. I repeat, this concludes this test of the emergency zombie broadcast system, brought to you by Nordak. Living solutions for a dying world. Damn it. Now I've got to wash them. - It is always a joy to see you, Vin. - Ah, the pleasure is all mine, of course, uncle. Retirement will never get in my way. When you need me, I will always come. - I know that, and I appreciate it. - And of course, I know if you called me, it must be important. - Top priority. We need something lost found. A zombie. Patient Z. - Patient Z? - With any outbreak, there is a patient zero. The start of it all. But with wifi, it was the radiation, soaking the earth for decades, until it mutated. It created a virus that infected the population. Turned them into monsters. But we have corrected the wifi. We fixed that situation. In, let's say, the important communities. But the millions upon millions from the outbreak, they roam free, infecting others with their organic form of the disease. But there's the treatment. It holds back the radiation, and it keeps the living doing just that. Living. - Well, I can attest to its effectiveness. - Every time I see that, it crushes me. It breaks my heart to know that someone I love like a son is infected with this terrible disease. But now you know why Patient Z is so important to me. Where do you think the treatment that keeps you, my friends, my colleagues, all of you, alive? Where do you think it comes from? - It comes from a zombie? - Yes. We came across him while we were searching for the cure. There was something special about his blood. It continued to regenerate, unlike any other zombie, and it held back the radiation. We have a supply, of course, but it will run out. And soon, I am afraid. And then all of this, the billions of dollars my clients have poured into Nordak, all of this will go away. Your bodyguard there. He will go away. But worst of all, you, Vincent. You will go away. I need you on this, nephew. No other person has served me as well as you have. I need you to find the Patient Z and bring him back. - Well, I can assure you, uncle, even if I didn't have a personal interest in the matter, I can assure you that it would have my complete attention. I will find him and I will bring him back. Intact. - I know that you will. You have always made me proud. And I've always done my best to take very good care of you for your years of love and loyalty. - For you, uncle, I would do it for free. - I know that you would. - So, is there anything else I should be aware of? - No. That is all for now. Just find Patient Z and bring him back to me. Unharmed, if possible. Or at the very least, still reanimated. And if anyone or anything gets in your way, you have cart blanche. - I'll have him shortly. - Jonray! Jonray! - What do you want? It can't be. - Maybe he was a Kali master. Like you. In his life-life. - And maybe you were thin, in your life-life. - Looks like he's doing the form better than you. - Better than me? Then that means he's way better than you. - The difference is, I don't care. You figure out how he got out? - Don't know. The cell was open, but the key's right where we left it. - It's fuckin' weird. It's twice now. Maybe the lock's broken. Maybe he's magic. - Maybe. You need to get rid of that van. Same thing. Beggar's Gulch. Dump it. - Ungrateful. You're not the boss of me. Besides. We're even now. Again with that? Oh, yeah. Nice. - You're gonna need this. Don't forget it this time. - Can I keep these? - No. - At least let me try to sell 'em. - No Nordak guns. - You're no fun. - Get the door. You know, we used to use this cell to hide Crisanto's still during inspections. Though those tapered off, years ago. I guess the local politicians decided there were more pressing matters than what sort of contraband the settlements were running. Or perhaps they just lacked the manpower. Nowadays, we use it for the occasional stray zombies that we might come across. Sorta like you. We're supposed to hold them, call Nordak for disposal. But eventually, I had a better idea. Now I keep them a bit, so I can study them, try to understand better what triggers them, how good their senses are when they lock on prey. What their weak points are. I go out and hunt. I kill your kind, Z. Those lessons help me do it, each time, a little quicker, a little better. I've been doing it... I don't know. Maybe 10 years now? The locals, some saw me. Talked about it. And they gave me a name. They call me the Hunter. Funny, huh? I think 'cause this world's gone to hell, they saw what I was doing and they romanticized it. In their heads, I was doing it for them. Clearing the undead. Making it safer for them. I don't do it for them, Z. I do it for me. I despise your kind. - I analyzed the data that we have and we lost the signal about here, just short of Tugorios. - And the vehicle stopped? - The towers aren't the best out there. Too few safe zones, so the signal's weak. We got the signal back briefly, here. Just past the town, before we lost it again for good. But we did get a report within the gulch that the vehicle was seen here. We've been focusing our search in that area. - And what about the van? - The informant only mentioned a jeep. - All right. Send me that information. - Yes, sir. - The following is a test of the emergency zombie broadcast system. It is only a test. I repeat. The following is a test of the emergency zombie broadcast system. It is only a test. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. This concludes this test of the emergency zombie broadcast system, brought to you by Nordak. Living solutions for a dying world. - I know we got off to a rough start, but I got a killer brew I think you'll enjoy. I've never made a mix for a zombie before, but I got you covered, Z. I picked out all the best ingredients. I know what you zombies like. A little blood, a little guts, a little bones. The hardest part is coming up with a name. How about "Undeath by Whiskey"? I don't know. What do you think? Jonray! - What's happening now? - It's not there brother. - Again? - Let's see what he does. - Stop. - Who do you think you are? You think you're human? Well, you're not. That'll never happen again. Pick that shit up. You know... I'm sorry for what I said. It's just that what you did... It's not possible. It's just not possible. But yet... Here we are. What do we do now? Keep your hand up. Up. What are you? I think that's enough for today. Let's head back to the barn. - Ah. Just in time. So you saw the van that we're looking for? What about the driver? Well, if you were to see him again, would you be able to identify him? Good. You see this? It's a cell phone. Direct line to me, and me only. You see that man again, you call me. You do that and all this can be yours. So, what do you say? We got a deal? Good. Now get outta here. - One would have been good. - You and I both know the radiation from that cell phone will turn him within a week. I need results, fast. And I don't fail. - Still lamenting over the one who got away. For all signs point to her embrace, within the dark arms of death. - Well, until I find a body, the hunt's still on. - Damn Crisanto what a smell. What're you doing in here? - Jonray! - What's up brother? - I'm heading into town. Starting a new brew. Running low on supplies. You need anything? - No, No all good.. I'm good. - God damn it! Z! You gotta stop doing that! Jonray! Why does he have those clothes? - What's wrong with the clothes? I thought Johnny can use some new clothes. - "Johnny"? You're kidding me, right? You're giving him the name "Johnny"? - Crisanto please. Let it go. - "Let it go." He's not a lost puppy that you just found and you're gonna keep forever! He's a zombie! An unusual one, yes, but he's still a zombie! People are gonna come looking for him! Hopefully, that doctor, but if not, then other people! Powerful people! And don't say, So what are you going to do? - What. You don't think I realize that? - No! I don't belive you do. - Don't believe it then. - Later. Z! - You, uh... You did good today, Johnny. Maybe one day, we'll move you up to the house. Do me a favor, though. For now, stay here. - Hard! - And Johnny, where is he? - In front. Go get him. - Johnny. Johnny? - Dad? - Johnny. No. No! - Where is he? Don't. I just want Patient Z. Please. I was there the day they brought Patient Z in. They said he was just another zombie brought in for testing, but I had my doubts. His cells regenerated. No zombie ever did that. They knew his blood was a resistance to the virus, before we had even conducted one test. And I could tell he felt things. Pain. - I found something on Johnny. - "Johnny"? - He's my brother. - Dr. Lars. How about that short stack of pancakes? - You know... I didn't catch it. - Emge. Emge Gort. - That's a beautiful name. Why don't I show you my room? We can let these two adults have some quiet time, and discuss business. - Sorry. You're not my type. - Not your, what? Strong and muscular? I'm slouching. Look. - This is it. I mean, some of it's missing. The initial prep but I can fill in those blanks easy enough. Can you imagine it? A permanent cure? No more payouts on weekly treatments? One shot at birth and you're immune to the bites. Immune to the radiation. This will cripple Nordak, in the long run. Look, we have to get Johnny outta here. I have a lab, well hidden. We have to get him there. - Wait. A permanent cure for what? - I'll explain later. You are taking him? - Well, yes, of course. We can't keep him here. I'm amazed you've been able to keep him hidden this long. - I've seen heavy patrols in town, but the outskirts are vast. They don't come around here anymore. - But they will, eventually, when Patient Z doesn't turn up. Regardless, we need my lab and I think the two of you would wanna get back to your lives. - I'll go with you. - Look, if you're worried about me, I have Emge here, and a larger escort set up near the south gate. - I'm going, at least till you get back. After that, if I'm comfortable, I'll head back here. - It's not me you're worried about. How you call him Johnny. You care about him. - Are you guys expecting anyone else? - See, monster boy? I knew she was alive. - Stupid. - Crisanto! - Death takes me, but I won't go alo... - Crisanto! Triangle. Crossover. Move forward Again. Pull hard! Damn bro. You've been practicing. - Who else is gonna keep you safe? - He's usually nearby. I'll check the woods. If he's not there, I'll double check the house. Dr. Lars, you cover the aqueduct. Crisanto, try the yard to the right and if not there then come back here - We leave then. - We can't. We're not leaving Johnny. - Brother - I do not know who you are! And I do not know how you found this property in the first place. But if you give me Patient Z, we will not kill you. - The following is a test of the emergency zombie broadcast system. It is only a test. - Let's take it easy, old man. - Ten. Nine. - Cooperate and I may even be willing to make a donation, or two, to your struggling farm. - Three. Two. One. - Johnny! - Dad? I'm okay, Dad. - Oh, thank Jesus Christ, Holy Father, Lord you're alright. - Dad? Dad? - This concludes this test of the emergency zombie broadcast system, brought to you by Nordak. Living solutions for a dying world. - I will give you one last chance. Tell me where Patient Z is and I will let you go. Of course, I cannot promise you will live, but at least you will not die at this very moment, at the hands of my friend here. - Hurry up. My family is waiting for me. - You see, my associate here, Mr. Clark. He has a quirk that I find interesting. You see, he never looks a person in the eye, unless he intends to kill them. Mr. Clark! You have changed, Patient Z. Impressive. But I am not surprised. You see, you are not just some person who was infected with the disease. No. But I know what you really are. And if you knew what that was, you would know that I could never let you escape. - Z! Z! Z! Come on! - You can run, Patient Z! But you will want to come find me. And you already know exactly how to do that. - Johnny! This used to be Jonray's favorite place. He'd come up here with Johnny. I'm not sure if he told you that. That was his son's name. My nephew. Johnny. Johnny loved watching the bikers. They'd sit up here together, for hours. Right here. When he was old enough, he got his own bike. He was a smart kid. Smartest kid I ever knew. Not really coordinated, though. He was never great at it. But he kept trying. Slowly. He was improving. Jonray, though? He was a great dad. He'd sit up here and watch him all day, if he could. And when he was done, Johnny would come up to him and ask him how he did. Jonray would praise him. Every time. Ask him... He'd tell him how wonderful he did. How proud he was. After Johnny died, Jonray only came up here just one more time. Then... I don't think he could take it anymore. He used to be such a happy guy. But the bitterness took over. He picked up his sword. He'd go into the dead zone. He never put it down again. But I don't think I need to tell you about any of that. Johnny! - You think you've won today? You only caught me by surprise here. But I know you will come looking for me. And I will let you find me, because Z, I don't think you are ready for what you will find.
