Stop, who the hell are you? - I'm Lambe. TIMES, WATERS Are you digging Dudule? And the water is under your nose... Oh, God, Thou art in Heavens and witnessed our troubles and sufferings, we beg you to help us in accordance with our old customs and bless the waters of this river. the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. ...In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Bravo, bravo. Altan, go and change. Run towards Kamenovo, look, Run. People from Kamenovo, people from Kamenovo. God's curse has come true. The water has dried up. The people from Sushevo took the water away. To the source, to the source. Everybody to the source. People, the villagers from Kamenovo are coming. Petre, there'll be a fight. People, the villagers from Kamenovo are coming. They're coming. Let them come. Let's see how they're going to take the water. What is it? What is this supposed to mean? -What do you want? Who has let you steal the water? - We don't steal, we are just taking what's ours. - How come it's your water? It's within our boundaries. You don't seem to have come to your senses, fuck your Lord. How dare you swear with God's name on your lips, you dog. Hit, people, just hit. Motherfuckers, they came to take the water. There had no water. Clean the sabre!!! - Yes, sir. What is it?-Sergeant major, sir, the villagers from Sushevo and Kamenovo are having a fight near the Krstec water source. -Get ready. Get ready. - Come on, come on, in a line! Get the horse ready. - Yes, sir. Attention! Guns in your hands. To the right. To the source, run. Come on, come on, hurry up. What's up, handsome? Your villagers have started a fight with the villagers from Kamenovo. At the Krstec water source. Heads are being broken, I swear. When are we going to check these registers? Leave the registers. Let sort this out first. Good luck with that. - Fuck this silly sergeant. On 5 April 1933, the villagers of Sushevo and Kamenovo started a fight over the Krstec water source. By doing so, they jeopardized the law and order of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Court of His Majesty, by God's mercy and the will of the people, the king Alexander of Yugoslavia, has called for the opposing sides to reconsider the case and for the Court to issue a verdict in the spirit of law and justice. The representatives of the villages are present. Your names. Korun Maksimovic, the village mayor and Petar Kjushko from Sushevo. Velicko Krstic, the village mayor And Panteli Nikolic. Write them down. So, let's hear, how did the dispute start? Villagers from Sushevo, your Honour, tried to take our water. Speak Serbian. - They simply took our water by force. We had to, your Honour, when they won't let us have it. The crops in the fields are parched. The livestock is dying, the mill is not working. -One by one. -Your Honour, I, Petre Kjushko, want to say something. I'll start from the beginning, your Honour. The dispute over the water has been going on since Turkish times. There was an earthquake and the ground cracked and started issuing water. Our villagers from Sushevo ran to it and so did the villagers from Kamenevo. They were all rejoicing because God showed mercy and gave water to this poor area. But the joy was short-lived. We all, both their people and ours, began stealing the water, turning it only to our own villages. It came to fighting. In one such squabble my grandfather was killed. Turkish authorities got involved and they said that the courts should resolve this. And that's when the court case began. The water changed hands from one village to the other. Whoever had more money to give, whoever had more might to grab it, the water was theirs. While the water has always been just ours. It's within our boundaries. -How come it is yours, can you prove it? The title deeds were the proof, your Honour. -Do you have them? We used to, Your Honour. But, when the building of the court burnt down, in the Balkan war, they burnt with it. And you, have you got any? Our title deeds burnt too, Your Honour. Those were false title deeds. - False, how come? Silence, Go away, now. The court will reach a verdict. What was the court's decision? Nothing, this magistrate is just like the old one. Whoever pays more gets the water. I told you that it is money that fights and money that wins. If money is what's needed, I'll sort it out. Listen, this is all we have managed to collect. Deal with this and God help you. All right, I am as thick as thieves with the magistrates. -Go on, then. You, come here, come, come on. - What is it, Petre? So that's how you dealt with it! - Wait. Catch Futak. Catch the crook. Wait a bit, people. - After him, catch him. Let's see where you are going to run now? Stop or I'll kill you. You'll see now, just wait. Stop when I'm saying. Let's demolish his house, people. -Open the door! Come out, Futak! Are you going to come out or not? No. - Come out, Futak. Futak! Let's burn him down. Give us some hay and flame. You go over there. Come out, Lambe. - Open, or we'll break your bones... He will, he will! - Let him burn like tallow. Come out, come out you fool. You'll burn like the devil. Hit him, hit him, hit the motherfucker. Enough, leave him be. Enough, Ironie, that was enough. I have no guilt, brothers, I have no guilt. -Put the fire out. The money was eaten by the lawyers. You lying dog. You drank and gambled the money with them. Wait, people, wait a bit. Wait, don't sin, wait. It's not my fault, the lawyers ate up all the money. God will pay them back and God will pay you too. -What has he done? The devil take him. He squandered the money we gave him for the court. Ah, bloody hell. Come here, you nonce. - You're sinning against me, people. Come on, people, go home. - Now we have to collect money again. I'll get the people together in the church. I'll try and collect some more money. But, I can't do it on my own. You, as the mayor, should help me. You should try and squeeze them a bit, so that all of them contribute. Your shop seems to be doing well. - If it continues like this, I'll be a beggar soon. Goodbye and good luck. Have you found anything, Dudule? There is something, there is some big water down there, it just takes a lot of digging. There. You trouble your soul in vain, Dudule. Important news, people, important news. The King is coming. Everybody come out to meet him. I told you that the yellow race will win. It is true, people. It is true, people. He's come to help us with the water. The sergeant Zika Krstic has ordered all of us to come out and greet him. They saw him turning off the big road towards Sushevo. Stop, what is this? Head up. The belt. Good. He's coming, people, he's coming. Long live the King. Long live the Queen. Long live the royal family. Long live the King. Long live the royal family. - Long live the King. Hello, hello, hello. - Long live the King. Long live our King. -I see there's been some confusion here. Long live the King. - Long live the King I see there's some confusion here. This is not His Royal Highness, but Velya. Long live the King. I took him with me so that I won't have to go on foot. Is that so? I see he's dressed somewhat strangely. Like he's the king, but not really. - And was His Majesty prevented from coming? - Yes. His Royal Highness, the King Alexander I called me and told me: Go and see what my people are doing, how they live, what they do, whether they have any water. Long live the king! - Long live the king! Mr Emissary of His Royal Highness the King. The sergeant of the gendarmerie, Zika Krstic, at your service. In the village of Sushevo with 150 houses and 1150 living and healthy patriots of our kingdom. You're welcome. - It's all right. Greetings for the Emissary. God help you, brave people. - God help you. It's all right, it's all right, sergeant major. We serve our king and our fatherland, Mr Emissary. And now, Mr Kuze, You're welcome to visit my inn. Let us sit down for a bit. -Let God bless you with a long life, people! Welcome, my dear husband. You left us all breathless. How is life? - There, I'm craving. For water? -For you. I haven't seen you for so long. Are you coming home? - Not now, I can't. Wait, wait a little. Well, Mr. Kuze, let us drink to our Highness's health. To his health. There, Mr. Kuze, this is what we have managed to collect. - Will we succeed, Mr. Kuze? Will His Majesty help us? - Absolutely. His Majesty the King has already ordered to be sent a map of this place. So that he can see the boundaries and the water source. There, Mr. Kuze, I have collected this money from the people to fix the church. But the people have decided to give it to you to help sort out this water business. Take it. There. The people said that there's nothing holier than water. There isn't. There, here you go, Mr. Kuze. - You're welcome. I will make her a famous opera singer. There'll be none like in the entire Balkans. -Thank you, Mr. Korun. Thank you. -Let us have some good news, Mr. Kuze. Easy now and God keep you safe. - Thank you, father. Have a good trip. - After me. Milena, write to me. - What am I going to do without you? Your dress fits you so well. Wait for me, I'll be back. Goodbye and farewell. You Velyanica, you don't need water? Depends, one can't survive just on water. And now, women, it's my turn. She's eyeing up that foal, hey. - That's not how it's done. What brought you over here? - I came to collect the water tax. It's 2-3.5 dinars this month. - A tax for a mill that does not work. The authorities have ordered. - They can go and fuck themselves. They should ask from the villagers of Kamenovo. They gave them the water. What can one do, master Petre? Only what the authorities say, goes. They can do as they please. I haven't got a spare soul. I am not paying tax for a mill that does not work. What got into you, master Kjushko, to throw your money in vain on a watermill? You broke your back working in American mines and spent all the money you earned on a mill. You could have done something else with it. Mind your own business. I don't want to meddle, Petre. I apologize if I have wronged you. The fields are parched for water. I don't feel like walking past them. People yell after me, why do we need the waterman when we have no water. I heard from the priest Trifilot that Kuze got active again. He's met the King. -The King? - Yes. You cheered me up. I'm off to cheer up the women. - You should give up on that. What can I do? Someone has to come handy and do them some good. Goodbye, Petre. -God give you good health and good reason. Hello there. - Where are you off to? To collect water tax. -What water? If only the plague would kill them There's hope. Mr. Kuze will help us. -Ah, Mr Kuze. Rejoice, he's made your husband a member of the Sokoli. God give hin good health. Velyan got some work in Belgrade. I don't need a Skol, Altan. I need a husband. How did you find out that I'm here, Altan? I smelt you. Altan! Two by two go to the village. Hey you, where is the mayor? At... - Ah, Mr. Mayor I have good news. The president of the court in Struga has called you. Cheers! -A message has arrived from His Majesty the King about the water. Congratulations. -Congratulations. Long live the King. - Long live the King. I'm off. -Wait, we'll have a drink, Mr. Zika. Wait, Mr. Zika, we'll have a drink to celebrate the news, the joy. Bring us some of that rakija. The good one, the three-year-old. As you command, father. There you go, Mr. Sergeant. - Long live His Majesty the King. Long live the King. - Long live the King. Let it be. - Let go, let go of it. Come on, to your health. To the water we're going to get. To our water. With regards to the appeal submitted by the villagers from Sushevo and on the basis of the topographic map of the terrain, it was established that the Krstec water source is on the territory of the village of Kamenovo. The appeal submitted by the village of Sushevo is therefore groundless. The cabinet of His Majesty, by God's mercy and by the will of the people, Alexander I Karagjorgjevic. the King of Yugoslavia. - That's not true, Your Honour. That's injustice. -What? On their territory, Your Honour? What cadastre books say that? -Be quiet. Who are you to say what's correct, and what's not? Who are you to complain against His Majesty's decisions? Out. Get out of here. Guards, guards. Take them away. We will complain, Your Honour. Is everything in order, Your Honour? What is it, what happened? - That's what happened. What? Has the king failed to resolve this? He has decided to refute our appeal, that's it. How can this be? - It can, with money it can be. On the basis of the false map that the prefecture has sent. Down with the prefecture, down with king. -Down, you rascals. Down with them. - Villagers, we are all going. They'll see who we are. - Down with them. Yes, yes, let us all go to Struga. - Let's go. And prove it to them. - All of us to Struga. All. -People, villagers, for the rights for water we must fight ourselves. That's right, that's right. - Let's all go to Struga. We'll all sit in the prefecture and won't leave until the justice is done. Let's go. - We'll the King know that these robbers trade with our water and that he's taken their side. Let's go to Struga. - Let's go. Down with the prefecture. - Down with it. Down with the King. - Villagers, all to Struga. Leave it, Kjushko. Nothing will come out of it. Don't give me that bullshit. - Villagers. All to Struga. Come on, come on. Let's all go. Where are you going, Petre? - Go home. Hey! Stop! Where do you think you're going, you rascals. Go home. We're going to the prefecture. We won't live without water anymore. We will demand retract of the King's decision. Listen to me, Kjushko. Who gave you the right to speak up, to rouse the people against the King? I'll fuck you all, you motherfuckers. - Not to rouse the people. Down with the King. - Down with him. Come on, people. -Who the hell has allowed you to rebel against the King, you cattle? Beat them up. Down with the King. Eh, Ziko, Ziko, what else will you have to go through? Split, go away. Go home. The rifle, the rifle. -Come on, get away from here, leave. What is it, people? Where are you running to? Has the water come? Did the King bring us the water, my arse! -Stop foreboding evil! You dog, oh, Jesus. - Leave it, Deacon, leave it. Leave it, you fool. You fool. - Yes, sir. Leave it. -Holy Mother of God, forgive me my sin. Oh, the troubles I've been through today. I wish the floods would come and sweep you all, to drown you all, you shitbags, shitbags! Hit it, hit lower, master. - I'm looking for water. God bless your soul and bless your discovery. One two, dig here. There's nothing there. There's nothing here either, dig somewhere else. Do you know whether there's water or not? Patience! Dig there. Nothing, nothing. - We are following a madman. I told you so. - There's nothing here either. Nothing, nothing. Let's go. Is something going to come up? Wait. Do you know whether there's water or not?-Enough. Come on people, it's over. Are you going to leave me alone? Yes, with your disturbed mind. And what if I find water? - God will come to your help. Shitbags. Men, villagers, people. Gather all here. Come here. Hear me men. People hear, hear. The King Alexander is dead. He was killed in France. Hear, hear, villagers, the King is dead. General mourning has been ordered. No playing music, no singing. A service should be held in the church for the repose of the soul of His Majesty. Every house should be in mourning. Whoever does not obey this order will be punished. People, villagers, the King is dead. What is he yelling about? - It is difficult, Korun, very difficult. Australia is a continent. It was dis... -Teacher. -Wait. Australia was discovered... - Teacher. Why are you out of breath? - The King is dead. The King. -Yes, He was killed in France, in Marseille. So what. -General mourning has been ordered. The children should go home. - Why should we mourn him? Because he didn't recognize us as a nation. Because he fleecedus with fines and taxes. He left you dry without water. And yet, children, there is still justice in the world. Kings die too. The first grade can leave. Come on. This is for the fourth grade only. Because we have finished about Great Britain, we will now talk about Russia. Write it down, children. Listen to this, quickly. My house, oh, my house, fuck your beams. Everything else I have fucked and I'll fuck you too. Stop. Milena, Milena. Where's Milena? Korun. -Yes, sir, sergeant major? Give me some. Give me some, of, my King. Bless you, Korun. You don't understand a thing. To the King! Teacher, teacher, fuck you, teacher. Sit, sit down. Ah, my king, my king. Why did they have to kill him today? On my family feast day. Fuck it! Attention. Summon all the gendarmes. All of them. And bring a coffin. Is it clear? Priest, I'm dead. He's gone off the rocker. Shame on you, you yokels. The King is dead and all you can say is water, water. Shame on you, I'm dying of sorrow for the king. Who's going to drink, who's going to knock? How lucky was Stamena, Stamena, asking for cold water, cold water. Hey, Dodole. Vay, Dodole. Vay. Let God send us the dew, Vay, Dodole, vay. Dew to bring us harvest, Vay, Elijah, vay. Vay, Dodole, vay. Dew of wine, let us have, Vay Elijah, vay, vay, doodle, vay. Grain and wine, honey and oil, Vay, Elijah, vay, vay, Dodole, vay. give them some, oy, loole, oy. It'll rain, it won't, it'll rain, it won't, it'll rain, it won't. It won't, it won't. - Oy, loole, oy. Vailoole, vai. Hey, godfather, the grape for rakija has gone sour. Let's start distilling. Let's make some rakija, let's get drunk, Let's drink ourselves senseless. Everything else can go to hell. What will you distil it with? There isn't a drop of water in the wells. We'll buy some from that dog, from Zika. Come on, pour some. - That's enough drinking Deacon. Get the flask and fill it, Let's take some to the teacher. Hello. How are you? - Pour some rakija, for the holiday. Wife, fill a pitcher to take it for the repose of my mother' soul. There is one filled. -When there is no water, we should take her rakija. What are you gaping at? Come on, go. Where are you going, you sniveller? -Here. Get lost. Go and toll the bell, for God's blessing for the plums. The church will reap the benefit too. And be careful how you toll, not like for a burial. As you command, father. It's broad daylight. It would be a great shame. God can see me. -It is dark now, God can't see you. I will toll the bell as it is right, by God. Twice, thrice. My fool can't think of something like this. He's been obsessed with various quirks. Twice, thrice, thrice. Please, God, forgive me. Fuck it, I deserve it when I mingle with whomever I find. Korun, Korun! - What happened? The child. My child is burning. He's dying, Korun. Typhus. Please, God, help us. - And now this, on top of everything. Please, God, save us. Come on, come on children. Go inside. May your memory live for ever, give them peace Christ, say your farewells now. Cursed illness, dear God. What have we done to deserve this? The sixth, Aleksandar Trajkovic, the seventh, Petre Stojanovic. Why did you take him from us, in his bloom, oh my dear child. Your mother's only child. We guarded you like a flower. Like a raindrop in a palm. You went underground, scorching my heart forever. What are you writing?-The prefecture has ordered us to submit data about all who died of typhus. Have you asked yourself why people died? I don't know. What are you doing Mr. Mayor? Go to hell with that counting. Tell the prefecture that they'd better prevent this illness instead of counting the dead. Go away. Deacon. Go and get a bucket of quicklime and spray around the church. So that the plague does not enter the church. Give me the censer, come on, hurry up. Altan. - Whoaa... come over here. Velyan has left me, he's heard something. He's of no use to you. With Mr Kuze, he has visited all the whores in Belgrade. -You're very thirsty. I am. But only you can quench my thirst. Come on, hurry up. - Give us some more money. I have none left, swear to God. - If you have none, give back the water. We've busted our guts to bring water and give it to you, so that you don't drop dead without water and you want it for free. Give it back and go. Give us the pan. A dinar for every pan. Two pans, two dinars. C'mon, c'mon. To you, beauty, Zika will give water for free. Zika has a generous soul. See what he does! Petre, what are we going to do for water? Buy some until they clean the wells. They can go to hell. Trading with our own water. Teofil, get the rifles. Petre. My son. Hold it. - Petre, wait. Come back home. - Bye, mother. Korun, Korun, my best man. - What is it, what happened? Petre and the sons have gone to the water source. Something will happen. They'll kill each other. Don't let the, please, don't let them. Stop them, Korun. Petre, Kjushko. Petre... Stop, don't go. You, stubborn ass, you want to bang your head against a brick wall? Stop, Petre. Where are you going? Do you want to take it by force? If they intend to keep it by force, I'll take it from them by force. Leave it, man, don't throw your boys into the fire too. Look after your family. Leave my family alone. This is for the entire village. As the mayor, you can gather more people so that we can show them. But wait, what people, what fight? The gendarmes are just waiting. They'll burn us. If you're afraid, I'll go on my own. -Stop, Petre. Don't touch me. Listen to me, my best man, if you do that again, I'll empty the rifle. I won't let them trade with our water anymore. Teofil, come with me. Split, so that we can ambush them. Shoot when you have to. Beware. Hide. You motherfuckers. Come out Kjushko. Oh, my leg Velichko. -Come out, so that I can tear your shadow. Come out, motherfucker. Where? - Around. Kneel. Grab the pitchforks. C'mon, c'mon. Father... oh, oh... Go back, come on. Easy, easy, my leg. It's ours, children, It's ours. -Father, they've killed Rome. Over there. What are you waiting for? Shoot! You'll die just as my son died. Velichko... If you kill him, you'll have to kill them and me too. Forgive me, Velichko. After all this I have decided to move to Sushevo. What happened? Who killed him? - No one, he fell from a walnut tree. And broke his head, hey? You can tell such stories to someone else, Kjushko. Don't cry brothers. He was a real son of mine. Best wishes, our house is rejoicing. Kjushko has got a daughter. - A daughter. God giving, God taking Kjushko. You've got a baby daughter. Thank today's saint, the holy Archangel. Angjelka has been born to you. Hear, hear, people. I'm not lying to you, there, I'll read the order coming from the authorities. General mobilization has been declared. All between the ages of 20 and 40 must report for military service. Whoever fails to do so, will be tried by a court martial. Hear, hear, people. The country has declared... Master Korun, our children are going to serve in the army. I'll go and tell Teofil the happy news. Bye now. '... going to the army, going to the army, mother, to become a soldier...' Take care, son. - I will. You're now both my nephew and son. Take care. -Don't worry. Take care children, all of you. - Good luck, Gasho. Take care of my Altan, Holy Mother of God, and bring him back to me safe and sound. What sorceries do you apply, Velyanica? So that you can stay young and beautiful forever. I'll come to you to rejuvenate myself. Go and break your neck, you sniveller, as if I need you. You protest in vain. I will light your candle. The wick will get into the lamp. Why did it have to break right now? - It can go to hell. Fuck the state that even the King has abandoned. Fuck, they gnaw us to the bone. -We'll stand our ground. That's a great power. They've all joined together. 'The incursion of the enemy forces that started on' '6 April is going on.' 'Our country has been attacked from all sides.' What does the teacher say? He says that they've occupied entire Europe. Entire Europe?-Give me a piece of paper and I'll show you. Let's see. - This is Europe and this is Germany. This is Poland and this is Czechoslovakia. This is Italy and this is Bulgaria. It sold itself to the Germans and they are now fighting on the same side. But, they have it coming, My granddad had three of them stabbed on his bayonet in one go. They'll have three of us on theirs now. -Don't give me that bullshit! Korun, one more double rakija. -You know, my granddad was just like that. Hurry up, run faster, motherfuckers. Run to the left, to the left. Take the weapons out. - You, come with me. Uh, you motherfucker, take the archive out. Quick, quick, don't drop behind, you stupid cattle. Run, run wherever you can. Sergeant, my brother. Where are you going without me? Milan, where are you going? - Run after me. Where sergeant? Where? -We're running away. The Italians are in Struga. And who's going to defend the country? - I don't care. The King has fled, and who am I without my king? I just take care of my own skin. Come on, little one, you defend it. Deacon, deacon, deacon. Sweet deacon, open the door. What is it? - Toll the bell. Our folks are coming back. - Thank God. People, villagers, your soldiers are coming back. Villagers, they're alive. People! Altan, Altan! -Why are you just standing there? Here I am. Altan! Thank you dear Mother of God. He's come back to me safe and sound. How come you don't have wather? You live with out wather? There is no water, sir. The authorities gave it to the neighbouring village, to Kamenovo. Where is the water? - Over there, above the village. You will continue being the mayor. - Ah, no, sir. I had enough. Find another one. Now tell them, I am the village mayor here. There, you dreamt about becoming the mayor and your dream has now come true. -No, I'll tell them. I'm going to the mill. - I'll bring my grain. Let go of it, I'll do it on my own. Go and help outside. I'll call the children. Come on. - Hurry up. There, I saved them like the eyes in my head. But, there's nothing dearer than freedom. Don't bring shame to my house. - Farewell, son, take care. Farewell, Petre. - Bye. Father. - Come on, don't make me sad. Come on. - Father. Come on. Let's go. -Hurry up. She's a very pretty girl. As beautiful as the Holy Virgin. Do you understand? Long hair, eyes the color of the sky. Where is she now? Trpana? - Yes. Is it Trpana that caught your eye? The devil take you. Trpana is a shepherdess in the mountain. Taking the sheep to graze in the Mountain. Baa, baa. - In the mountain? Do you hear that singing? Very beautiful singing. Bravo. I've come back, you see. I see. So, it's over. You've become a priest. - Wit the papers to prove it. And now? - We'll serve God together, I'm going to perform... - Get lost, you ass! ...my first service. Master Korun. A drink for everybody. From priest Klofin. I'll pay you tomorrow. -God forbid! Things one comes across on this earth. The plague will take you, you scared me. Who is this priest, I wondered. Let me tell you, I'll keep my word. I will light your lamp, as I promised. There's no one to bless your soul and body. Are you ever going to grow old, Velyanica? You'll drive me mad with your beauty. -No. Wine is wine, some wine for me. The Holy Scriptures talk about the beneficiary influence of wine all the time. The wine cleans the bladder. It contains natural water without lime or other harmful things that ordinary water has in it. You drink wine when your soul sings. You drink wine when your soul weeps. When your heart weeps. You drink wine at christenings and at funerals and in the world after. Wine frees you from fear. From worries and from sleepless nights. Drink, come on, drink up, drink. Drink, brothers, come on, come on. Come, let me kiss you. Uh, my pretty boy. Come on, stop drawing. Drink some wine. Get lost. Priest Trifil, you have pretty icons. Look. Gjorgji, I'll pay you. You give me the icon. Is that all right? All right, all right, but you're a tricky customer. You give me a rifle, a machine gun, Two pistols, bombs and I'll give you icons. This is St. George and this is St. Paul. You give me two machine guns and two rifles. All right, priest Trifil, all right. - Come here, I'll give you a kiss. My pretty boy. Be blessed in the name of the Father, the Son... Emergency... sir, the sergeant orders you to come to him immediately. We're going to attack the partisans. Motherfuckers... we'll have to take the shit. Priest Trifil... Come on, take them, take them. Come on, hurry up! Go ahead! Priest Trifil, take the guns. - Ah, good, good. Partisans. - Against the partisans, go to hell. Master Korun, it is over for today. - Hold on a minute. Come, it's over. We're closing. - Priest Trifil, Kjushko... Partisans, all Italian soldiers are dead. Do you understand? The Fascists. The Gang. The village is burning... Let's all get together to meet them at the gorge. It would have been better if there weren't many of them. You're right. Men should all go up in the forest, while the women and the children should hide in my church. I'm christening Mitrush's son today. Go and take care of the children. Hurry up! -All right. What can I do for you, commander, sir? - To attention, damn it! Can you tell me what you are? A flock of sheep or Il Duce's army. Sir, we clashed with Tito's gangs... We were ambushed... We.... Silence! To attention! Soldiers, to attention! You are no soldiers, but cowards and scoundrels. You've allowed a handful of communist gangs to scare you away and you showed them your heels. And you dare call yourselves Il Duce's soldiers?! But... sir... - Silence! Ah, Italy, Italy! You've sent these brainless cowards to fight for you here. These are all faggots and dickheads. Sergeant! Yes, sir. - Who's that over there? The village mayor. - Come here. Where are the villagers? - In the church. Let's go to them. - Yes, sir. Come on! Move on! Very nice! A newborn scabby communist. What is it? Nothing, sir. The little one... A little holy water over the little one. Go inside! -Mother, I swear by my father, you mustn't say a word. Shut up, woman. We know that these three communist dogs come from this village. Their mothers, wives and sisters are among you. If you want them to stay alive, Give us their names. Their names, their names. I'll count to ten. -He'll count to ten. Two. Three. Damned pigs! Slay them all! All of them! They'll slay everyone. Slay them all! Petre, man! Ah, you motherfuckers! You, devils. I know, there is no pardon, I sinned. -Quiet. Daughter, my dear daughter! You too! Come on Caramello, soldiers, come on. - Carmello. Trpana, honey, I'll go... - Carmello. Just a minute. I'm going to join the partisans. Do you understand? With Gasho, Teofilo, against the Germans... Trpana... you wait... I'll be back. We'll get married and we'll go to Sicily. All my relatives will like you there, and my little brother too. Sicily is almost the same as here. We'll be very happy there. My sweetheart. Goodbye. I'll be waiting for you. People, villagers, brothers, freedom is coming. Our soldiers are coming. Bravo, Gasho, our hero. - Hello, hello everyone. Stoyan! Where are you, Stoyan? Hello, hello dear mother. Safe and sound. - I'm back. Altan. Long live commander Gasho. - Long live our commander! Comrades... our long and difficult fight for freedom has won. Long live the victory. - Long live the victory. The end has come to our enemies' rule. They are retreating in panic. Buu... Buu... -They are retreating throughout the country. Down with the enemies. -Down with them. Macedonia is free, people. Long live comrade Tito. - Long live comrade Tito. All of Yugoslavia will be free soon. All of Europe, the whole world. Long live the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and its leader comrade Tito. Long live.... - Down with fascism. Down with it. Down with it. - Together with our freedom, our water will start flowing through this village. -Long live the water. Long live the water. -Altan, go and let the water run, hurry up. To arms, to arms, Macedonian people, for the holy freedom of the people... Hello. Hello, Petre. Long live our joy and freedom, son. Let it be so, godfather Kjushko. - Teofil? Teofil is with the division, with Drashko. He's an officer now. Skule we couldn't save. He was very badly wounded. I understand... I brought you his rifle. There it is... Kjushko, rejoice, freedom has come. Come Kjushko, the water has come. Kjushko, rejoice! This is the end of our struggle. -Rejoice, Kjushko! Death to fascism! - Freedom to the people! Where have you come from, Altan? - I let the water flow. Do you see that dickhead? - I saw him. He let the water run for your bride every day. Give me my child back, Altan, give it back. -Get off, you louse. Give me back my Vangja, Altan! What have I done wrong? Give me back my child, Altan. Altan, ah. Altan. Father... Altan, the child, Altan. You louse. Altan, give me back my child! The child, Altan, Altan! Mother, come. Comrades, I'm sorry that you had to wait. I have meetings all the time. Angya, coffee. So, my suggestion is to forget all that has passed. Let us now reach some understanding. - All right, let us hear it. The problem is obvious. Both villages need water. That's right, comrade president. - Our suggestion, then, is to share it. Half of the water goes to one village, half to the other. That won't do. The water does not go to both villages. It appears to be abundant, but, when it descends, it gets lost. Then divide it by days. One day you will have water, the other day they will. -Here, there. We are not on button. It won't do. On a weekly basis then. Or three days for one village, four for the other. Comrade Yak, for years we have been waiting for this to be resolved. -Wait. -Sit down. We have our own state now, let it find a solution. So that no more blood is spilt over it, like it did in the past. I know that Kamenovo needs water. And so do we, on a daily basis. I, comrade, am the man who could sell water to the entire world If I so pleased, if I had stayed in America. But, the bones of my parents called me back. What's that supposed to mean, 3 days of water and 4 days without. Three days alive, four days dead. What force is that inside you that cannot revive you and not kill you? I consider you a reasonable man. Petre. What does it mean if your mill works? Life for Sushevo only, what about Kamenovo? Thank you, comrade Yak. You are insulting us. -This is not about insults. There is no water. Prilep and other places have no water too. We'll have to solve the problem like I said, for now. We'll see what else can be done later on. Goodbye. Oooh, what are you doing here? Go away, you mole. Why are you digging my yard? I sensed water here. God will give us a great crack in the ground, and some great water will gush out out to sweep you all away. This is where the water passes. With a permission from the people's government, we fix cauldrons, cure from spells and illnesses. Come on people, come on... Come on men, come and see the prettiest Gipsy girl. There is no match to her from here to Istanbul. We fix umbrellas. Come on, we fix wells... A chicken fell into your well and fouled the water. You dug out a new well and found a gold coin. There. He's from afar. You loved him a lot. Some handsome man is troubling you. He's from far away. He's dying for you. All right now, no need for you to pay. Come on, people, let me give you, tell you, guess for all of you. Angjelka. Father. Father. Angel. - Brother Teofil. -Angjelka. How are you, godfather? Ah, godmother. I didn't recognize you, son. Ah, you're back then? I was looking for you at home, and this is where I find you. I'm going to mother's and Skule's grave. I transferred him to Rome the other day. And reburied him next to them. So that they can be together. God saved you, son, to come back safe and sound. To brighten my house. It'll be so, father, it'll be so. This is Magda. I have decided to marry her. Good luck to you both. She is very nice. She works in Skopje. - In Skopje, you say. Yes. She's Velichko's daughter, from Kamenovo. -Velichko's daughter. The one who brought mourning to this house. -No. We don't know who killed Rome. There were many of them. Leave that alone now. Leave the past to the past. If you have decided to take her, then you should leave, son. - Wait a bit, father. She'll be a good wife. You'll see. I don't want to see anything. Or hear anything. I don't want a daughter in law from that damned tribe. -But, father! -Silence! Father. Come on. Father, brother Teofil! Wait a bit, man. Why won't you let him marry her? - I'm not mixing my blood with theirs. But wait... -No waiting. You are his godfather, I am his father. Hear, hear, villagers. Citizens. People. Caramello is back. Carmello is here. Here I am, Trpana, I'm back. - Yes. I was taken prisoner by the Germans. - Yes. Now, it is over, I'm back. - Yes. I came so that we can marry. - Good. Go to your left. Left, left, a little bit more. Just a little bit more, all right, all right. OK, it's fine. Kole, we'll have to cross over to the other side. All right. Just a little bit more, so that I can finish the drawing. Good day. - Good day. How are you? - Hello. Who are they? - Yes, really? How would I know? Let's tell Petre. - Yes, let's tell him. Petre, Petre. - Stop, get out from here. Petre, please, calm down. - Stay aside and don't interrupt. Where are you're going? - To the village, we need to measure. Not a step further. - What's going on? Get lost, I'll shoot. - Hold on, people! What's this? Will you please stop this? What is it? What's this? What are you going to build here? - Whatever it is needed, a power station. Our country needs electricity. Factories are constructed all over and there is no electricity. Enough of that. You should be glad that such a great facility is going to be built on our territory. And you, comrades, I see you are hostile to the project. We haven't fallen from the skies. We are part of this country too. Where the hell are we going to go when the water rises here? Will you please stop with these charades? Enough. You'll move to the city. To a better life. You'll get land, money. To build your own houses. Why don't you build further up or down, and not in our village? We don't decide about the site of the dam but the experts. They decide what's the best place for it. Kamenovo will have to move as well. Back off. - Petre. If you shoot me, others will come and get this done. What will the villagers from Sushevo do in the city? Will they plant on the cobbles, or just hold their dicks in their hands? Everyone will get a job. The police will have to clear the ground, then. Let's go. Keep digging Dudule, keep digging. Why don't we look for a different solution, best man? The solution is not to give up. Whoever comes, we'll meet them. There is some justice in this land. There is, but not with spite and murders. Let's give up. Priest, let the bell toll for funeral. Let God wipe this village out. And us with it, when we are not united. God, let us keep our reason, please, God. Take a picture here. - Ah, here they are. Good day. - Good day. How many acres of land do you own? - Five cauldrons of seed. How much is that? -How much? Enough for a donkey to roll about. What category? - No category. My land can cover anyone. It's not picky. Shame on you! Good day. - Hello. How is it going? - The going is tough. It'll be better. - Let's move on. Measure this house. - Hello. Good day. - Good day. What kind of material was used for your house?-Crappy one. When the mines for the dam started exploding, it all shook apart. If my kids were injured I would have shot someone. Wait. What do you mean, crappy? This is first-class stone. Hello. Hello. - Hello, Mare. How are you? - Welcome, my dear wife. We built it with gold coins. I'm his wife, Mare. All right. How many are you? -Four children, him and me, and my blind mother. Where are you going to house us? - The committee will decide. We just collect data. Who is the legal owner of the house? I am, he doesn't care much. Look at him, scruffy as he is. But, I do care. That's your own business. Did you finish measuring? 12x10. Bye. - Goodbye. Bye Mare. - Farewell. Welcome, welcome my housewife. Would you mind coming inside? I've come and I'm leaving now, but everything will be all right. All right, then. Hello. - Hello. And now we're going to Petre Kjushko's house. -And? God knows what awaits us there. He's locked himself up there at the sheepfold, above the mill. He lets no one in and speaks to no one. You go on through the village, I'll go and see him. I wouldn't go alone if I were you. He huffs and puffs like a raging bull. No worries. - All right, then. Bye. -Bye. What do you want here? I came to have a rakija with you and to talk to you. I might be able to find some rakija, but if you've come for something else, I don't want to hear a word. Do you understand? The accumulation will flood the mill. You haven't found anyone to give up. You'd like to drive us around, as if we were sheep, or calves for that matter. You tell us, go there, we do. You say to us, do this, and we do. Petre, you've reached a dead end. I have said it and I'll say it again, I'm not going to the city. but this here, this is in my heart, in my soul, not to be found anywhere else. What are you going to do on your own? Our land is not just this land here, the mill and Sushevo. Get out of my sight now, I don't want to see you. Who are you going to take it from to give it to me? You flood hills and valleys, and we have so little land. It's enough. All right, Petre, do as you please. But the machines will come and what then? I'll wait for you. - Father! How's university? - Plodding along. You see, Petre, life goes on. I saw brother Teofil in town. He's waiting for you. He can do as he pleases. And leave me alone. And you mind your own business. Study. I'll stay here with you. Let's go home. I'll study for the exams. Take your bag. There you go, comrade Yak, they're all registered. Hello. - Hello. Hello, Mitrush. Hello. - Hello. Hello, Milena. - Hello, comrade Yak. How are you? Now, comrades, let us get this straight. If you won't move to the city, we offer you another possibility. We'll build you a new village further up, Above the triangulation point, above the water level. We'll build it all modern. With all the facilities, electricity, water, roads. This village will be a different village elsewhere. -Do as you please, then. Dear child, what about the church? To whom will we leave the church? There are as many churches in the city as you wish. The moving will start very soon. Think about my offer, so that you won't regret it later. Come on. How is it going in Belgrade, comrade Drashko? Dudule, your digging has come to an end. Now the water has come, too much of it. You go, priest. My water has not come yet. You go, go. And it will sweep you away. People, people, the water, people, I found water. People, ha... ha... people... What is it, you mice? Why are you running away? There's the water you've been looking for. You've been bickering about it all your lives. Fighting for it. There you go, now. Up to your necks. There it is, now. Ha-ha. Petre, Korun, there is your water now! Where are you running, you mice, ha-ha. There it is, up to your necks. Ha-ha, ha-ha... THE END
