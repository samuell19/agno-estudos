This Charming Girl - How do you want it sent? - Could I get a receipt? Just a moment, please. You can send it by general post. They're all general post? Over there, then. Here? See you, girls! - Good bye. - Hey. I thought you were buying us dinner last week? Right, this week, for sure! She always says 'this week! ' That's 1,200 won. Here. - Hello, sir - Is your boss out? - He's not back from lunch - Still? Here he comes. Something's missing. Is it over there? Is this it? How do I post this? I'll do it. Just put it in that bin, please. Goodbye. Mr. Kim, we haven't even had lunch yet! I know, I'm late. Mr. Choi from Accounting called. Tidy up your desk! With this mess, no wonder you make mistakes. Look at this. An 'F'! Alright, sir. Hello, Shinsu-dong post office. Let's go. I'm starved! What's that? An eyelash! Hello? Okay, bye. What should we get to eat? What should we get? What do you feel like? I asked first! Anything in particular you want? Nothing I can think of... You're always like that... Let's try another place for a change! Going to the same place is more comfortable. I think their food's alright. Sure, it is. I just thought we could try something new. This stop, Jugong Complex 1. Next stop, Jugong Complex 2. Auntie, what's this? That's an herb that grows mostly in May and June... Is it good? It's got a nice bitter taste. How much would you like? Let me look around. A perfect choice for modern people. Who want to feel the power of infrared rays and microbes. Yes, it is possible... People usually hesitate for buying those clocks because of their price... - Good morning. - Hello. This is really old. We don't carry it any more. It went out of print a few years ago. One of our branches might have it in stock. Should I check and put in an order for you? Yes, please. However, the chicken is a white meat and a cucumber is green... - Who is it? - Delivery from LG Home shopping! Hello! You ordered kimchi? Yes. Here you go Sign here, please. Send it express, please. Today's express has already gone out. I thought the deadline was 12:00. It's 11:00. If you send it now, it'll get in by tomorrow. Should we do that? No baths for a week. And don't feed it just anything. When it gets better. Bring it back for vaccinations. - No baths, even? - Right. Are you going to stay there? - Excuse me... - Over here! Excuse me. Can I help you? Yes, er, registered mail, please? Let me have it. 2,750 won. Where did you go off to, before? What? I just... have this cat at home. How much for quick delivery? You mean express registered mail? How much more would that cost? 700 to 800 won, sir. Sorry, when will it arrive then? Within tomorrow. How would you like it sent? Express registered, please. Express registered? This is express registered! A dispatch form, please. Make sure you get it right! 3,800 won, sir. Your receipt and change. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Where did you go this afternoon? Yeah, what were you doing? I got this cat at home. A cat? Auntie, more popcorn! I don't like cats. What breed is it? Persian? No. It's mixed. Just a tiny kitten. Looks like a doll when it's still. What'd you get it for? That guy's good The Japanese guy. Good-looking, too. - Listen, I... - What? I have to get going first. Don't, we're gonna leave soon, too. I have a date, too. Let's just watch this first half. I'm sorry. I'll get the bill to make up for it. No, come on! Let's leave together after a bit. I'm worried about the cat at home. I have a husband at home! Sir! Please don't keep the door open too long there. - Do you need a bag? - Yes. 4,020 won, sir. Goodbye. Yeah... I'm on my way out. Yeah, sorry! Is Minyong there yet? - Goodbye - Bye. - Yes? - It's your aunt. - How are you? - Fine, you're doing okay, right? Yes. You should call once in a while. Need help with anything? No, I'm fine. Well, I don't think I can make it today... It slipped my mind your uncle and I have to go to a function. We can postpone it to next week. But, I have this alumni trip then. Are you going far away? The Philippines, some waterfall or other... I don't know... So I was thinking... give me your bank account number. My account number? What for? To send some flowers to your mom. Get some nice ones on your way over. It's alright. The ones I took last time are still there. Maybe so but I don't feel alright about it. Just give me your account number, okay? Excuse me! Yes? Really, that alarm clock noise... Could you turn it off first, please? Of course, just a minute. It's been going on for too long. It's unbearable. I can understand on weekdays, but... ...but today's a Sunday. Sunday! I'm really sorry. Let's try to be reasonable! You've got your father's ugly toenails. I thought they all looked that way. They say these need to be pretty for one to live well. It's been so long you 'can't even remember his face'... ...but you remember his toenails? It's always the things you don't want to remember that keep coming to mind. Mom, the sun's in my eyes. Let's close the curtains. Be still. Let me finish first. My eyes hurt! - There, how's that? - Okay. That hurts, mom! Sorry, that must have hurt. Regular mail takes about 10 days. Of course, it could take less time to Japan. It takes about 4 days by EMS. The ones that are going far have to be written out well. Eun... pyong... gu! And this is... - It's so hot! - It's hot, isn't it? Is there a Hwesan-dong? It's all in Chinese, Look! - It's Jeungsan-dong. - Ah, Jeungsan-dong! - Hi. - I've brought lots today. How many? - Whose phone is that? - Must be yours? Your mobile! Is it OK if I don't write it down for you? Is it okay for you to be out of the office? I'm in sales. Makes more sense to be out of the office. Let's eat! This looks like yours. You look good. What? You look better than before. Do I? Have you lost weight? Not really. I didn't think you'd still have the same number. Actually... I'm getting married next month. Is that so? Surprised? A little. Seemed like I should tell you. You know... You really hurt me. Thinking of that it didn't seem like this was necessary... But, the past is the past, and... No use for either of us to keep bad feelings, right? Seeing you again like this... What were you thinking? I didn't do anything wrong... I still don't understand. If you really. Didn't have anything to say... couldn't you at least have made up an excuse? What? You should get back. I'll be on my way. Have a good life. What's with those shoes? They're so old. Want me to buy you a pair? Who'd you have lunch with? Just someone I know. You look like something's up? No, what do you mean? You just look a bit dazed. Really? Nothing's up though. It's not like you'd say anything if there were. Don't mind me. I was just talking. Take your time. An eyelash! You keep losing them. You shouldnt just throw it away. You have to make a wish as you blow it away. Okay. I'll start doing that next time. Wait, not here like this. - Wait. - Be still. Something wrong with your blouse? What should we do? They say there are sulfur springs nearby. What was your first time like? The first time you had sex... ...your first time with a guy! How did it feel? Why do you ask, all of a sudden? It's not like we're strangers. Could we not... talk about that kind of thing? It's all right you can tell me about it! It just... hurt. It just hurt? Yeah. It just hurt...? Buying shoes? I'm just looking. I really don't know anything about shoes, but... Shouldn't you really try them on first? - Hello. - You're busy! - What's this? - General mail. - And this should go registered. - Registered? Here. How many are there? Five? Here. - It's hot, isn't it? - Yes, it is! Hello. Registered express mail, please. Excuse me, you... You have something on your face. An eyelash or something. You got it. - 3,410 won, please. - Here. They're giving parking tickets! Did you park outside? You're getting a ticket! - Thanks. - Bye.

Sister-in-law, this is nonsense! Lower your voice, Aunt. She'll hear you. I've never been so embarrassed. You know what the other family says? That I lied to get a mentally disturbed girl. Married off! Aunt! I need some kind of explanation if I'm to talk to the other family. She's not saying a thing. Do it later. Later! She must have her own reasons. You just take her part, no wonder she's like this. It's not always good to be protective! Wait, do you think... she really does have some kind of problem?
