FIVE CARTRIDGES Comrades in the trench All sing along. Let the other songs fall silent. We'll sing the song of the Jarama front, Where so many brothers have fallen. With tanks and with aircraft They were attacked. We only had courage and guns. Whatever the numbers who fell at our dyke Laid waste by the legionnaires. The grenades, they tore many A bloody hole in our ranks. We covered the road, We defended Madrid. We held the Arganda Bridge. Now poppies bloom again in Jarama Valley And bloom in front of our trench. Like a blood-red carpet They cover the land, Where so many of the best are buried. But later and always and everywhere, When workers are sitting together, The Battle of Jarama Will resound in song, Will inspire the hearts to do battle. And then some day, when the hour comes, And we scare all the specters away, The whole world will be the Jarama front, Just like in those February days. They're demanding ammo. They're demanding water. I can't provide them with either of those, Comrade Commissar. That means retreat. Yes. To behind the Ebro. You cover the retreat operation. Take five volunteers with you. I understand. The battalion will leave the base at 21.00 hours. You will follow us an hour later. I know, an hour in the trench, separated from the battalion, is an eternity. It certainly isn't rest and recuperation. Come what may, I'll send you a radio operator. The five volunteers... If you can, take men without wives and children. I understand, Comrade Major. Comrades... I'm looking for five volunteers. A doll for my Rosita. She's starting school this autumn. If she's still standing. -Hm. My daughter's leaving school this year. Comrade Commissar, I served as a gunner in the Czechoslovakian army for two years. When can I finally get rid of this toy? You promised me a cannon. Don't get upset, Jirka. Sanchez'll carve one for you. What do you need five volunteers for? Where are José and Willi? Adjacent to us. Seven. Five. - So how's the battle going? 150 to nil, Comrade Commissar. The thing is, I always have a bet on seven, but José always bets on five. Then I bet on five. - Then he's bound to have a seven. You have to master the trick, Comrade Commissar. Do you have any children, José? Children? No. Comrade Commissar. What about the ammunition? - A swig of water wouldn't be bad either. I wanted to speak to you. About... the ammunition? About our retreat. We're abandoning the base. And tobacco was due tomorrow. Comrades, what are we waiting for? Good evening. I almost missed you. That's Wasja, our radio operator. You're from headquarters? Have anything? I could radio my comrades in Moscow. Maybe they'll send us a packet of "Drug". I brought this. Commissar Witting. - We're rolling up the telephone line. Anything else I can do for you? Wait please, Comrade Major. You're the youngest, Willi. You can leave if you want. I can't, Comrade Commissar. I'm in the Communist Youth League. I've been playing dominoes with José for two years. And the battle still hasn't been won yet. We've got to stay together. Comrade Major, please store seven rations of tobacco. Thank you. Over and out. When our mission's been accomplished, I'll send up a white flare. We'll assemble here, by the Shepherd's cave. Take up position. "Soldiers on the other side! Why the hell are you fighting against us for the capitalists and fascists? You're workers and peasants, too. José Martinez Miner, now a soldier of the Republic without any tobacco or ammunition” Karl. Keep it for me. Why so solemn? You'll be back with us in two hours. It doesn't matter, keep it. - Quiet, comrades. We still have 60 rounds, if that flare doesn't go up soon. Go for it, Wasja! We have only machine gun ammo left. Hey! Get moving! Spain, beloved land, Spain of my loved ones. Who could fight in Spain for the poor without land? I must go to the tree and pick a flower for Spain, my country as a memory of my love. I must go to the tree and pick a flower... We must move on, Pierre. To the Shepherd's cave. Comrade Commissar. It's over, Comrade Commissar. They've trapped us. And tobacco was due today. There's no water, Comrade Commissar. That's worse than the enemy. If we go into the villages, we'll have to fight. If we don't... - Then we'll have to die wretchedly! Die slowly of thirst. Anyone who falters will break. You're communists. Those beasts are corroding the trees. I'm not a match, Comrade Commissar. Or a dung beetle, that just gives in and perishes. You're so cheerful. And what about Wasja? He's longing for the tobacco as much as we are. We'll search for him. Two hours. Then we'll march to the Ebro. Wasja! Fire! We can't do anything for now. But in three days at most, the Reds will go weak at the knees. Radio this: Guard all watering holes. Yes, sir! Comrade Commissar! Comrade Commissar! "Stay together, then you'll stay alive! Commissar Witting." Where did you find it? - Don't ask. In this area there are 4999 gorges and caves. Willi's counted them all. And Wasja? - Nothing. Two more days without water and nobody will think about Wasja anymore. Bread? Get those looks off your faces! The commissar will get us out of here. Should've been back ages ago. The Commissar's a Spartacist veteran. It wasn't for nothing that they put him with us. Sure. Where's Wasja? I can't carry on with you. Stay together, then you'll make it. It's all over now. You've got to get through. During the search for Wasja... a fascist officer... I fired first... in a map case... a sketch. The fascists'... deployment plan... for the Ebro crossing. We must inform HQ. For sure. Five centimeters of copper wire and we'd be able to radio our position. Everyone will get a piece of the sketch. If one of you falls, someone else will take his piece. José. Take the cartridge cases. Stay together. Take the sketch to HQ. Willi. Willi. If you get to Berlin... then... José. Take my shoes. You'll need them. Now it's our duty to get through. Come on, Willi. I bet the Sierra is full of dispersed Reds. If we aren't careful, we won't get any of them. Leave that to the sun and their thirst. We'll do the rest. Message from HQ: All watering holes are being guarded. Pierre. There! In the window. That was almost one cartridge case fewer. What's with the seven comrades, Otto? Have they already been written off? I don't know any more than you. Otto... from Willi. Poems. All the things the fight for freedom does to people. One man becomes a general, the other a poet. But a decent cook, we never get one of those. You'll soon get a cannon, Jirka. That'll put you in a good mood again. Comrade Major. - Thank you. Do you know the Shepherd's cave? - Yes, Comrade Major. In the early days, the cook was there with the supplies. Give us the cave's exact position. Here. Square B4, southeast corner. B4, southeast corner. When shall I head out, Comrade Major? It's too late for that today. Tomorrow just before sunrise. - Yes, sir. Comrade Otto? I need seven packets of these. Can you get them for me? - Yes, if I ever get to Moscow. From Willi. I think this is the best place for it. Comrade Major? Do you really want to search for the seven men? Seven comrades. And one who'd like to become a poet. For that I'll have the sierra turned upside down, stone by stone. We won't make it across. And if we shoot the guards on the bridge? The farmhouse sentries have horses. We'll be done for in five minutes. Storm the place, then we'll have food and drink. And for dessert a magazine full of bullets in our head. What'll become of the sketch? We've got to go back. Then we'll lose time. Without water. Work your way up closer to the bridge. The radio's done for, but at least I have got a piece of copper wire now. Are you crazy? Hello! Hello! Lieutenant. - Can't you knock? - The telephone line has been cut. Mount! Over there! VR! Viva Republica! They must have been here! Water! Someone's calling. If we don't find water soon, you'll be hearing very different ghosts. I thought somebody was calling. A thimbleful of olive oil for five men. The trickle can't save me either. I give us two more days at most. Then thirst will make us forget our mothers and fathers. Not to mention the sketch. If I were you I'd give my legs a wash. With spring water, the most refreshing. What's up with you? What have I done? Nothing. You've done nothing at all to me. This spittoon. This damned blue-painted spittoon! If only it would rain for once. I'm off to the valley. Maybe I'll find some water. Your cartridge! I gave it to Oleg. I just wanted to tell you... if there's a flare-up... we're on your side. If there's a flare-up, scram. Think of the sketch. Listen up. "When the sun has eaten up the shade And fiery boats pitch and toss in the sky I know how sweet a drop of water tastes. Why no shore awaits the boat in which the team and I are rowing." That's how our poet thinks. But I think Willi's right. No one's waiting for us anymore. Compafieros! What's up? - I need water, companieros. If possible, something to eat. The fascists are chasing me. I've been roaming around the sierra for six weeks. Are you on your own? -Yes. These are my reserves. Did the farmers help you? - You're the first I've approached. Wait here. We'll see what we can do. Six weeks on the sierra and his shoes are still almost new? You think... - If he's a fascist sent to put us to the test, we'll be hung. And if he's a republican? Huh? Juan? I've got it! Listen, Pedro. If he runs away, he's one of us. If he remains standing, he's a fascist. Hey, you! Guardia civil are in the village! Get out of here! He's running! Stop! Stop! Compaiiero! I saw it, he was sick with thirst. So why is he lying? We're farmers. Water. Why do you torment yourself? Go to a village. Maybe you'll be in luck. Go into a village. To a village! Go to a village! Water! That must be one of them. Compaiiero! He was one of the soldiers. Thirst drove him crazy. They'll all end up like that. They're taking him to the white house where they beat your Alonso to death. Did you call the captain? - He wants to conduct the interrogation. Blessed Virgin. A candle for every hit. They're running! They didn't get what they were hoping to get. If it wasn't for the enfilade, Captain... The mountains are teeming with Reds. - But you immediately took cover. The reinforcements! We can take up pursuit at once. Take an iron file. Water. Comrades, water. As long as one feels shame, everything's alright. No more than one sip each. Where are you going? To shave, but I've got no water! You heard it, Dimitri, as long as one feels shame, everything's alright. Take the sketch to HQ before thirst drives everyone crazy. What use is the sketch if we all die of thirst? Either that... or water. You're still alive, Pierre. Remember the sketch. You must go. You must go anyway. Enough of this palaver. We won't abandon you, Wasja. Well, they're here already. Throw it over. Move! Hey! Stop shooting! I've got something for you! Come here! What is it, you whoremonger? Something nice for you! Take a look! If you do anything stupid, you'll be a sieve in two seconds. I'll make sure I don't! - Throw it! "That's how we live. Don't be daft. Join us. Captain Fernandez de Navarra." Cigarettes. Write, Willi: This is what we live on. But we're not joining you. May I go now, sefiores? - Is there any wine left in the bottle? Straight from Malaga. From you, we'd take some. Rotter! Rotters! The sketch! Come on, get going! They're fleeing! We'll get him alive! At least Wasja got something to drink. "Still no news from the missing comrades." Radio this: Continue search at all costs. Report at once if successful. Seven canteens of water. That'll be enough for now. And now a cigarette. That'd be a knockout. Water. At last! Pierre! Stay here! Will's still up there! No matter, grab your water! Move! The sketch! Willi's got it! Provide cover! "Reds' detachment escaped heading for Ebro. Taking of water prevented.” Two battalions in action that are urgently needed at the front. And their success? Laughable. If you can tell me why a Red can live without water, but not you and I, then you should be promoted to General. Why didn't you take any water? There'd be one fewer, but you'd have water. That's not a sketch! It's a whip! Five men are snuffing it here together! That's why! Comrades... we've done what was humanly possible. We've got to split up. Every man for himself now. And who'll be responsible for the sketch? It has to go to HQ. Then take it there! You want to go alone? -Yes. I can shorten your journey. You can shoot me in the back, so that I don't see the infamy. That's three days in the cooler for disrespecting republican weapons. That's enough! Onwards! They've found them! Four turned into a gorge. A fifth gave waving signals. Comrades. I have a difficult task to perform now. I have to get some tobacco. Go! Futile. It's all futile. Pierre's right. We've got to split up. Otherwise we'll all die! I want to fight! To take one more with me before it's over! We've brought the cases this far, comrades. Now the cases are going to get us to HQ. There they are! Four of them! A message! From HQ! "Providing cover. Range 500 meters. Between one and two o'clock. Stick to covered escape route."” They did think of us after all. Always. The Ebro. Observe the fire for 15 minutes. Then see where you can get through best. When you're in the Ebro, take two or three sips at most. Or else it'll rupture your intestines. And you? What about you? You only ever talk about us. I can't swim. How much? Battery! Fire! Keep calm, José! Just keep calm! Major Bolafios. Second company. They've made it, Comrade Major. Four men. And the fifth? What about the fifth comrade? You thought you could smoke our tobacco? You can swim to New York with that. Now poppies bloom again In the Jarama Valley And bloom in front of our trench. Like a blood-red carpet They cover the land... Comrades, I'm looking for five volunteers. Where so many of the best are buried. Comrade Major, please store seven tobacco rations. But later and always and everywhere, When workers are sitting together, So how's the battle going? Then bet on five. The Battle of Jarama Will resound in song, Will inspire the hearts to do battle. And then some day, when the hour comes, As we scare all the specters away, The whole world will be the Jarama front, Just like in those February days.
