[MUSIC PLAYING] GRANT (VOICEOVER): When I was a kid, I had this dream, a dream I shared with my brother. A dream where I was flying. A dream my brother turned into reality. But sometimes, the price of a dream is too high. [MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER (OVER PA): And ladies and gentlemen, here come the racers! [CHEERING] Midway now through the Transcon Air Race, with Grant Irvine leading. Josh Rubin's in second, David Long in third. The rest of the pack battling it out for fourth and fifth place. Kevin, I need a weather report for the refuel. Kevin? Go, yes. Kev, I need a weather report for the refuel. Front still moving south. You should be able to clear it. Then bring the fuel bird over, OK? Telemetry shows 1,600 pounds in your wing reserves. You can make this leg without a refuel. Well, Kev, the computer doesn't want to go as fast as I do. Grant, if you pit now, you're going to drop at least three positions. - Come on, Kev. Who you gonna trust? The computer or your own brother? All right. Descend 18,000 feet. Intercept our course and prepare for refuel. Copy that. John, did the lexicon pilot just call for his fuel tanker? JOHN: We'll it on satellite cam. What the hell is Irvine thinking? He'll lose the lead. Lexicon pilot, why is your tanker on course for flight coordinates? KEVIN (OVER RADIO): We're descending down to 2,200 feet. We're way out of the flight path. Airspace is on the flight path. Get your tanker out of there now. All right, guys. Release the boom. Let's get ready for refuel. Let's do this. All right. Grant, it's all good. MAN (OVER RADIO): Looks like Irvine is refueling. Kick in the burners. Let's meet while they're down. GRANT (OVER RADIO): Kev, where's the tank? Pack's 20 seconds back. How you holding up? I can't complain. I wish this was going faster, though. Whoa! Hey! Hey! - What happened? Wind shear! Wind shear! Wind shear! We got wind shear! GRANT (OVER RADIO): Kev, what the hell's going on? Disengage! Disengage! Disengage! I repeat, disengage! I can't keep on top the aircraft! It's pulling me down! We are under heavy wind shear. Advise to redirect pilot. Grant! We're shutting off the fuel! We're shutting off the fuel! Disconnect the boom! GRANT: I'm clear. I'm clear. Kev, get out of there right now! We're trying! [SCREAMING] End transmission? No, stay live. Stay live. Bail out! Bail out! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! No time to think. Just get those 'chutes on and let's go! We can do this! Here we go! You're up! GRANT (OVER RADIO): I've got a hit. Probably the right wing. I'm going to have to eject! Then go! Ready? Three, two, one, eject! All right, the crew's all out! Bail out! Bail out! [GROANING] [THUNDEROUS BOOM] Roll all emergency ground crews under the flight path. Do it now! GRANT (OVER RADIO): Please, don't! No, no, no, no! God. God damn. No. REPORTER (ON TV): And this was the tragic scene yesterday of the Transcon Air Race. A mid-air refueling disaster left three pilots dead, along with 11 spectators. A board of inquiry will be held to investigate both Kevin and Grant Irvine, captains of the ill-fated Lexicon team-- along with Chris Bannon and other representatives of the Transcon Air Race-- to determine responsibility for this deadly catastrophe. Mr. Irvine, according to our records, you called for the fuel tanker and met your team at approved coordinates. Yes, sir. OFFICIAL: But then both a jet and a tanker dropped down to the flight path? We were hit by wind shear. OFFICIAL: Mr. Bannon? Sir? OFFICIAL: You radioed the lexicon tanker and requested they clear the flight plan. That's correct. OFFICIAL: And did the crew chief, Kevin Irvine, comply with the request? Certainly not in a reasonable amount of time, sir. That is bullshit. Kevin told you exactly what our situation was! OFFICIAL: Sit down, Mr. Irvine. Please, sir. Thing is, I wasn't sure why the Lexicon team was performing a mid-air refuel at that time in the first place. OFFICIAL: And why is that? Well, they were leading with plenty of fuel for the next leg. The weather front was crossing their flight path. Not the time to be performing a mid-air refuel. The tower authorized it! OFFICIAL: Mr. Irvine, I said sit down. Sit down! Captain Diedrich, can you continue with your recollection of what happened? At 13:37, I heard Captain Sessler on the radio, telling me he was breaking off toward Irvine's jet. That's the last thing I heard him say. And the pilot is Hans Sessler? He was. My teammate. Thank you, Captain. Mr. Bannon, are you feeling vindicated now that all but one of the seven violations have been dropped against you? Pleased with the board's ruling. Have no further comment at this time. Bannon, you hung us out. Not my ruling, Grant. You sold me and my brother out. You made us look like a couple of fucking assholes! Didn't need my help for that. Listen, man, you were a pilot once. You know how it feels to be up there. We're supposed to stick together. Difference is I was a good pilot. KEVIN: Hey! - Son of a bitch! Look, we're sorry about that. He's just a little upset right now. Sorry about what? What? He ruined our fucking life! Do you realize that? I can't fucking believe you! MALE REPORTER: Results from the Air Race hearings closed in a lose-lose situation. Transcon's Chris Bannon is stripped of his powers to supervise another air race, while Grant Irvine's pilot license has been suspended. Brother Kevin Irvine is due back at Ashfield US Air Force Base to continue his service. Meanwhile, air racing in supersonic categories has been suspended indefinitely. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHILDREN LAUGHING EXCITEDLY] You Grant Irvine? Grant? Nah. We work for Mr. Bannon, Mr. Irvine. Bannon who? He'd like to meet with you. Listen, I don't know Grant Irvine. And even if I did, I wouldn't want to talk to Mr. Bannon anyway. We can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way. Where'd you learn that, at thug school? Here, catch! OK. All right. All right. It's cool. It's cool, guys. So you going to come along or what? [COUGHING] Grant Irvine. How the hell have you been? How does it look like I've been? Thank you, gentlemen. Please wait outside. Can I have my wrench back? Thank you. Drink? Why am I here? I have an offer for you. An offer? What could you possibly have that I want? A golden opportunity. An opportunity? For what? Last I heard, the FAA wasn't letting you promote another A race. Yes, well, that's all changed. Mm. Caught a hell of a break. Had one hell of a lawyer. You buried Kevin and me. You were the ones flying that day. You're supposed to protect your pilots. Not sell them out so you could save your ass. The hearing board didn't see it that way. Well, fuck the hearing! It was your show. I want you to race again. Not as a pilot, not in the jet. As a crew chief for a top sponsored jet and pilot. You want me to work for somebody else as crew chief? It'll give you a chance to stop feeling sorry for yourself. Crew chief? I guess, what, am I too old to fly? Not everyone keeps their wings forever. Look at me. Yeah, you gave them up so you can be in front of TV cameras, right? Can we stop kicking each other in the teeth, please? Will you do it? Crew chief, huh? Crew chief. Pass. Really? I don't need the headache. I think you mean you don't need the responsibility for someone other than yourself. Oh, look who's talking. It's been real. You sure? Yeah, damn. Open this door! OK. Open this fucking door! It's too bad, though. Zenith's got an airframe with some serious gear on it. Got a hot shit pilot to fly it, too. That's great. Guy's the real deal. Flies with his hair on fire. What do you need me for? They say he's even better than you were. Yeah? Who? [SNAPPING FINGERS] Your little brother, Kevin Irvine. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Give me one moment, please. Hey, congratulations, man. Thank you. How about a hug, huh? A handshake? Another bar fight? Yeah, bad day at the office. Oh. Well, you look sober for the moment. If I remember correctly, I got two of these in a real war called Desert Storm. Remember that? Oh, and Macedonia wasn't a real war? Albanians with stingers? Try shaking a couple of Sams with Infralock, huh? Oh, yeah. Major. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. You're a real piece of work, you know that? What are you doing here? You here to reenlist? I was actually forced to meet with our former friend, Bannon. He says you're flying the Transcon. I can't believe you let him talk you into it. Oh, Grant, do we have to talk about this right now? Are you out of your mind? You can't fly for him! You know that! Can we talk about this later? Hello, ladies. Hi. - Would you mind? Sure. [CAMERA CLICKS] Call us. All right. Thanks, ladies. Bye, ladies. So you want to know why I said I'd race for him? Yeah. Why? Because race pilots get three times more action than fighter pilots. That's great. Grant are you going to be my crew chief or not? What if I'm not? Well, I'm going to fly this plane. So if you're not, then I'm going to find somebody else. You're going to find somebody else? Tell me something here. Whose idea was to hire me, anyway? Yours or Bannon? You still haven't figured this out yet, have you? What? Bannon doesn't need you. I do. You're my brother. You're the only one that I trust out there. EXECUTIVE: It's a simple system, Mr. Bannon. Arbitron ratings equals dollars. You need viewers. I guarantee you'll have them. Our bank's informed us you have an escrow for the prize money. It'll be there within 48 hours. Good. And a racing note. The FAA and NTSC has restricted mid-air refuels and diverted them away from the spectator areas. Yes, you'll get your coverage from the blimp and satellite camp. They're also requesting a 100-meter cushion between the race jets on all legs except the final one. The concern was that a bottleneck of supersonic jets was a disaster waiting to happen. Well, safety is a concern, especially for spectators. But the race and the Arbitron ratings are your concern. Oh, you'll get your ratings. I hope so. OK, let's look over the safety precautions. Accidents will happen. It's impossible to prevent them. Of course. OK. Pilots know the risks and the amount of safety restrictions imposed. I'm not sure I follow. The Transcon crash was the single most watched, highest rated piece of news footage in the history of our network. It's kept us in business for the last four years. Nothing's even compared to it. Are you following me now? Are we-- [CLEARING THROAT] Are we talking about the pilot's safety? I don't know, Mr. Bannon. Are we? If it's an exciting race you're looking for, the Transcon will make Formula One look like a go-kart race. Good. Because this network has a big stake involved, nearly $1 billion. The $20 million we're asking from you is just to show my board of directors that you have something at stake with us. - Don't worry. - Don't worry? It's my job to worry, Chris. Remember, you said $20 million, in escrow, within the next 48 hours. [MUSIC PLAYING] So. Which one is it? Nah. It's inside. Well? I like it. You like it? Yeah. I said I like it. Good. Cause you're not flying it. How does she look on me? Like it doesn't fit. Tempus 12 aero package, twin Barton XR 600 turbo ram jets, resin composites resistant to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, Jupiter linkages, Wharton flight controls. What's the range? 2,000 under mach two. [SNORTING] What? You don't deserve it. Fine. I don't. What do you want to do about it? You want to cry or do you want to get to work? Excuse me. Is this the Zenith team? Hi. Hi. Kevin Irvine, team pilot. Trina Raymond. Oh, um, you a reporter? Because, you know, the media is not really allowed back here. But I think I can arrange a personal interview. Personal interview? Yeah, sure. I'm not a reporter. No? Oh. Well, then, what can we do for you, Miss Raymond? Captain Raymond. I'm your fuel tanker pilot. Zenith rep said they called you guys. You fly a 135 tanker? Yeah, among other things. Grant Irvine, crew chief. Yeah, I know. Transcon, four years ago. Yeah, well, let's go check out that fuel bird. You must increase your speed, especially at the slalom. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Kev, how's she handling? A little slippery on the afterburner, Grant. Well, cut those burners in the middle of the turn, not before it. Yeah, I got to keep air speed. Remember, man, it's at least 10 miles to make turns at mach speed. You cut those turns close, or you'll be history in the slalom section. Remember that. Yeah, yeah. Went under 12. He's fastest so far. He's good. Yeah, he's good, but I'm great. I see modesty is not a big virtue in the Irvine family. Nah. Chris. How are you? Good, Vladimir. Good. Vince. Vince? How many CEOs in the Fortune have the first name of Vladimir? Oh, I see. And how many of them close their deals in old, abandoned warehouses? Yes. Which brings me to the next subject. I don't want questions from your network. Don't worry. They won't ask. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] This much money, there's always someone who will ask. Vlad-- Vince. Don't worry. Chris, you understand that you're not dealing with the Bank of America? The penalty for the late payment is something you can't afford. I understand. Upon the completion of the race, we will expect our $35 million payment. Wait. I-- I thought we agreed-- the loan is $25 million. I thought the loan fee was $5 million, a total of 30. If you have a better offer, please take it. No. No, I just didn't expect the vig to be almost 50%. You mean loan fee? Right. Loan fee. Chris, I'm not putting a gun to your head here. At least not yet. No, not yet. Not yet. [APPLAUSE] Kevin. Kevin, here. Thank you very much. We'll be answering all the questions after the show. Thank you, OK? We'll be answering all the questions, I promise. Thank you. Thank you very much! [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on! Let's hear it! Yeah! Yeah, OK. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey. Don't pay attention to him, OK? Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, the starting line for this year's Transcon race will be Los Angeles, California. From there, the flight path will oscillate across the world, making turns in major cities above and below the equator. Slower tankers will maintain a flight path directly above the equator. There, the race jets will intercept for mid-air pit stops, for fuel, repairs, and the one-time pilot exchange, which is allowed under the rules. Ladies and gentlemen, the Transcon is the longest, fastest race on earth. Let's meet the pilots. David Diedrich and Team Mabach from Germany. Russian pilot, Andrei Smovoky. The only female jet pilot in this year's Transcon, representing Team Velonix in Canada, Catherine Rose. Chinese Air Force pilot, Hirosho Xiang. American Kevin Irvine and the Zenith team. GRANT: Yeah! That's my brother! Let's get it on! Hey, Grant. Some more of that Irvine modesty? You better believe it. And finally, for Her Majesty's Royal Air Force, Colonel Philip Turlington! Ladies and gentlemen, this year's Transcon race pilots. KEVIN: No, it's a proven fact pilots don't like to think about that. We don't go to funerals. We don't pick up the newspapers, watch TV, or listen to anything else that talks about death and racing. And you have a girlfriend? Who told you that? No, I don't have a girlfriend. You know, if you've got someone that's worrying about you, then I can't hit those afterburners and go mach 2. Hey, Grant. Team working out OK? Yep. Saw the time on Kevin's qualifying round. Good numbers. Thanks. I hear the kid gives a good interview, unlike you. So Irvine. Your little brother Kevin's flying out. Yep. That's bad. We all hoped the sky would be a little bit safer this year. Are you telling me something here? I believe I already did. Listen, I promised my little brother that I wasn't going to get myself any type of trouble, so I won't. And I'm also willing to put what happened four years ago in the past, all right? I lost my wing man, my best friend. Well, I lost four of my men on my fuel bird. Remember that? It was your fault! It was my fucking fault? You don't know half of the shit that I-- Easy, guys. Come on. Sponsors are watching. It's a dinner party. You, you got a race tomorrow. Go on. Shit. You threw up last night, right? Twice. Did you at least sleep? Nope. Well, I did. Hey, listen. Everything's going to be all right, huh? Let's get a cup of coffee. All right? Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm-- I-- OK. Just keep your eye on this number right there. Stop. Stop. Stop with that. OK, boys, look sharp. Look sharp. Hi. Hi. Hi, you ready? Ready. Everything's ready? Come on, guys. You know how I work. I want all systems on. I want radar. I want to know his positioning. I want to know his RPM. I want all systems on right now! PRODUCER: And we're live in 3, 2, 1. And we're just moments away from the start of this year's Transcon Air Race, brought to you by NTC, its affiliates, and Wright Campbell's Technology Solutions. [ENGINES POWERING UP] Everything seems to be good. Copy that. Today's race begins with a flying start. After the jets take off in pairs, they make a long turn and hit the holographic starting line at supersonic speeds. [MUSIC PLAYING] There is the turn and burn. Get ready. And this year's Transcon race is officially underway! GRANT: All right, Kev. I got you. How you doing? I'm all good up here. I'm running fourth behind the Chinese team and I got the German on my ass. Oh, Diedrich. Don't sweat him. Just worry about the race. You're running fourth right now. That's pretty good. Listen, we're taking off in about five minutes. I'll get back to you when we're airborne. OK, guys, strap in. Let's go. Let's go. Strap in! - Copy that. BANNON (OVER PA): The pilots are now making their way across the first check, downtown Los Angeles. Up next, Buenos Aires. Philip Turlington and the British team are in the early lead. As the pilots settle in the first leg of the race, let's take a look at the Transcon global flight path. From here in Los Angeles, the pilots will head south to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The pilots will then turn north and head across the Atlantic Ocean to Paris, France, head north to Moscow, where they'll turn south again to Nairobi, Kenya. Turning north again towards Sri Lanka, heading towards eastern Russia, turning east at Vladivostok. Then across the Pacific Ocean for the last leg and back here to Los Angeles at the Colosseum for the finish. At stake, $25 million cash prize and the honor of being the fastest pilot in the world's fastest race. And PRODUCER: And cut. We're clear. OK. Who is it? Yes, this is Chris. Go ahead. No, no, no! TOWER MAN (OVER RADIO): You have clearance. Roger, Tower. Tanker 135 ready for takeoff. All right, Kev. Fuel bird is up in the air. Weather seems to be fine, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You dropped a fifth. Everything OK? Yeah, it's all good up here. Now stay under three seconds off the lead jet. If he breaks off, you break off with him. OK? Copy that. Listen, it's a 24-hour race. Just pace yourself. Let the race come to you. ANNOUNCER (OVER PA): And remember, folks. Be sure and stop by the concession stand to receive your free complimentary drink and hot dog, provided by NTC International. Hey, Grant, I think the British team is making their move. It's skimming over the Baja Sound. No, he's setting up the pack. When everyone else drops, he'll shoot right back up and kick in his afterburners. You'll go vertical at the same time and fly into each other. No. No. KEVIN (OVER RADIO): There they go. The rest of the pack is dropping. So what's our move? Well, keep your altitude. And by the time the chase pack catches up, you'll move up a position or two. Copy that. RACE DIRECTOR 1 (OVER RADIO): Looks like everyone's following except Zenith team. Let's wait him out. Proceed. I don't know what kind of game he's playing, but stay with the leader. Don't compromise your position. What? Network for you. Hello? You told them the race started less than an hour ago, didn't you? - Now, talk to me. What's going on with the rest of the pack? Still chasing the Brit. Now hold onto your line. Stay sharp. He'll make his move soon. He's pushed ahead by two seconds now. He'll definitely overheat his engines. Mr. Bannon? They're ready for you. PRODUCER: And we are going live in 3, 2, and-- As the pilots settle into the first leg of the race, let's take a look at how NTC brings this exciting action into your living rooms. In addition to the cockpit cams, each race jet is equipped with small cameras in the nose, the wings, and the fuselage. A series of airships-- or blimps, if you will-- will float high above the flight path, getting wide open views over the oceans. Our most powerful cameras are mounted on several satellites in orbit around the world. The other cameras come from our news helicopters, broadcast trucks and another NTC affiliates positioned at major turning points and cities around the flight path. Over 4,000 cameras are used to bring this exciting Transcon race into your living rooms. PRODUCER: And cut! Thanks. [PHONE RINGING] Fuck! Still dropping. Network again. Bannon. Steve, I've seen them. It's early. It's early! No, really, trust me. RACE DIRECTOR 2 (OVER RADIO): Well, it looks as though Irvine's not going to bite. Ascend back up to 5,000 feet. Hey, Grant, I think the Brit's starting to make his move. RACE DIRECTOR 3 (OVER RADIO): Stay with the pack! Stay with the pack! You're going to have to hold that position. Intercept his course. Stay ahead of the chase pack or they'll overshoot and T-bone you on the way up. I got him, Grant. Shit! OK, here we go. Jet wash! GRANT (OVER RADIO): Kev, you OK? KEVIN (OVER RADIO): No problem. Jet wash. I'm in a jet wash, man, but it's not a problem. It's not a problem. Hey, keep your eye on your intakes, all right? I'm on it. [CROWD ERUPTING IN CHEERS] Hello? I see. I understand, yes. Yes. Goodbye. That was the network calling. The ratings have just spiked for the first time during the race! Yeah! Woohoo! Hold off flight path for mid-air refuel. Pilots will take on fuel and make minor repairs to the aircraft. Somewhere over Bolivia now. The first leg of the race almost complete with Turlington in first, Xiang in second, and Diedrich in third. Brought you guys a little snack. Thanks. Here you go. So how are you guys doing? Fine. Air is smooth. Listen, I just want to apologize for being an asshole the other day, you know? Aw, don't worry about it. I remember how your hot temper got you into trouble after last Transcon. Did you follow the Lexicon team? I followed the race, not you. Don't flatter yourself. That's not what I meant. TOWER MAN (OVER RADIO): Kevin's back up to fourth! Copy that. Kevin's fourth. Yeah. So it's shifting? And the FAA says divert? OK, thanks. National Weather Service is calling it Hurricane Natasha. It started moving towards the flight path about 20 minutes ago. So they made the turn at Buenos Aires and now they're over the Atlantic on the way to Paris, hm? Now we have, what, Natasha crossing the flight path? We're going to have to divert around the storm. Let's not be too hasty here. This hurricane's changed courses three times in the last six hours. Let's not slow down the race before we're sure. Mr. Bannon, the FAA is going to insist that we divert. Out. Out. Ladies. Close the door. Fuck the FAA. They don't have a billion dollars riding on this race, do they? - No, they don't. Diverting means refueling before they even reach the hurricane. It'll slow the whole race down, you understand? Refueling in a hurricane is extremely dangerous business. Yes. Danger equals ratings, Ty. [MUSIC PLAYING] Attention, all Transcon pilots. This is Bannon. I'm ordering all teams perform a mandatory-- repeat, mandatory-- refuel before you divert the storm. KEVIN (OVER RADIO): Mandatory refuel before diverting? Grant, are you hearing this bullshit? We're already in the middle of this storm! Yeah, I hear it, but I don't like it. Just stand by while I check with the tower. KEVIN (OVER RADIO): Copy that. Tower, tower, Zenith team requesting clarification on the mid-air refuel. The order's clear enough. Perform the refuel before you divert. Why can't we divert and refuel later? Because I can't send a pack of jets low on fuel into a storm. Bannon, we're in the shit up here! This is the wrong place to be doing a mid-air refuel! I can't control the weather, Irvine. Follow the order or we'll flag your team and your race is over. Do you copy? Yeah, I copy! I copy that you've got us making a dangerous mid-air refuel so you don't have to slow down your race and wait out this storm! You're in the middle of the Atlantic, Irvine. Where do you suggest I put down five jets and tankers low on fuel? Shit! Hey, Kev, we've got some nasty weather coming in our way. Copy that. All right. Get me Diedrich on line. Diedrich! Hello? Are you OK with this mid-air refuel? Yeah. You were there four years ago. You know what happened. Yeah? Don't let Bannon do it to us again. But it wasn't his fault, it was yours! Diedrich! We could all be killed this time! Quit trying to protect your brother. Let him race. Yeah, thanks for the tip. Hey, Trina, you got the new coordinates for the mid-air refuel? TRINA (OVER RADIO): Saving Campbell coordinates. Lining up for the refuel. RACE DIRECTOR 2 (OVER RADIO): I don't like it much, either. But you're here already, so let's get this over with, shall we? Connection! Cheers, mate! First again, with others not even close to docking yet. GRANT (OVER RADIO): It's so tight. We're about five minutes away! This is the worst place to be refueling. No kidding. We're flying a gas tank with a lightning rod. [THUNDEROUS BOOM] Shit! We've got a tanker gone! God! Kevin, break away from the refuel now! Break away! Shit! Shit! I've been hit! Something hit me! Mayday, mayday! KEVIN (OVER RADIO): Mayday! Mayday! Mayday, mayday, mayday! Going to autopilot! Kevin, do you read me? Kevin! Put your oxygen mask on right now! The canopy's damaged. Oxygen-- oxygen fail. Oxygen, no oxygen. Oxygen failure! He's got no oxygen. He's blacking out right now! [MUSIC PLAYING] He's sitting in an ice box. Trina! - This is Trina! - You're set. Kevin coordinates, get us there as fast as you can. You got that? - Copy that! Team, prepare for emergency evac! Let's go get Kevin right now! Let's go! We got Kevin's coordinates. He's right here. So it's definitely changing direction. OK. Yeah. And the NWS will stand by that? Well, that's good news. See, that's a nice spike. National Weather Service says the hurricane's changing direction. It's moving away from the flight path. BANNON (OVER RADIO): All pilots and tanker crews, the hurricane has changed course. Maintain group race coordinates. How long till the containment crews reach the crash site? Freighter can be there in about an hour. The hurricane keeps moving away. EPA and every goddamn tree hugger will be clogging the phone lines any second now. And the media. Not to mention the friends and family of that British team. Oh, right, yeah. Any word on the survivors on the British team? You saw that tanker blow. Right. Oh, look at that. Looks like we have another pilot to add to that list right. GRANT (OVER RADIO): Race tower! Race tower! Race tower! Zenith-- Zenith team has a pilot who needs immediate medical attention. Alert emergency ground crews at the nearest available airport. Do you copy? They're at 15 East, 36 South. Get back to me! - Got it, Zenith. Stand by. - What have you got? - Plotting now. Current speed should put that Zenith team roughly 2,800 miles off the coast of Sri Lanka. They'll never make it. Zenith team, this is the tower. Go tower. No immediate pick up and transfer on your pilot. What? Advise you administer all medical attention on board. Copy that, you son of a bitch! What the hell does that mean? It means that Kevin is in our hands now. Come on. It's been three minutes without oxygen. How close are we, Trina! TRINA (OVER RADIO): Grant, I got visuals right in front of us! Listen, Grant, even if his heart stopped, it's probably 50 below zero in the cockpit and you have a chance of recovery. [WARNING ALARM BEEPING] Is it charged? Come on! Hit him! - Clear! One, two, three, four, five, six! Recharged? Come on, charge him! Clear! Come on! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on! Come on! Hit him again! - Clear! - Goddammit, son! What are you doing? [MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] Come on, guys. Let's take him in there. What? Come on. Grab him. On three. Come on, let's go! Go. Let's get this show back on the road. ANNOUNCER (OVER PA): And Zenith pilot Kevin Irvine is OK! Where am I? You're 20,000 feet above the Atlantic, man. Did I-- (VOICE BREAKING) did I crash? You know, it blew. You blacked out. Shit. What happened to the jet? - Hey, man. I just-- I parked it for you downstairs, you know. MAN 1 (ON TV): I mean, just look at me. I'm sweating, for God's sake. MAN 2 (ON TV): Yeah. MAN 1 (ON TV): You know, look. Most of the air races, they tend to be drawn out and a little boring, if you know what I'm saying. MAN 2 (ON TV): I do exactly. The new 100-meter cushion has proved-- MAN 1 (ON TV): You know, for those of you at home who don't understand how we the cushion works yet, it's like this. The 100 meters now forces the pack of jets to remain within that distance to the leader jet and his or her flight deck. So when you see the leader jet drop a certain distance at a checkpoint at a certain time, most of the rest of the pack almost appear to be simply following the leader. They do cushion restriction, which, by the way, in my opinion, are absolutely brilliant. You know, let's take a moment to endorse our sponsors. Or should I say sponsor? Guys, could you bring up his photo? The man with the master plan, the genius behind his amazing event, Mr. Chris Bannon. She's all yours. How's he doing? So you-- you went to med school, huh? No. I just watched a lot of "ER." [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yes. Hello? Yes, I have them right here in front of me. Yes. Thank you. FEMALE ANNOUNCER (OVER PA): It was Kevin Irvine's life saved just a few minutes ago. Most of the world awaits any final word on whether or not the Zenith team will finish the race. Why don't you tell them? Tell them what? That we're finished. Trina? Hand over the plane to your co-pilot and just come here for a minute, please? You guys gather around. I've got something to say. Now, I'm going to give it to you guys straight. We fixed the jet, but we don't have a pilot. So we're done racing. But I want to tell you something. You guys did the best job possible. And I want to thank you for that, especially what you did for Kevin. I mean it. So I'll just radio in to Tower and let them know we're heading back and maybe next year, huh? Wait! Kevin can't fly, but that doesn't mean somebody else can't. She's right. In accordance to endurance racing, Transcon rules allows for one pilot switch. Only rule is switch pilot must be licensed and flown in any Transcon race in the last five years. I don't know about this. Come on. What have you got to lose? Ratings just spiked at 49 share, right after the British tanker blew. Everyone loves a barbecue. Zenith team wants back in. What, Kevin Irvine-- he wants to fly? Grant Irvine wants to replace Kevin's-- his brother Kevin as pilot. That's an interesting twist. He hasn't been licensed in four years. So what? He doesn't exactly have the most sterling reputation as a pilot. Who gives a shit about his fucking reputation at this point? He's a major liability. He's a loose cannon! That's the end of this conversation. Boys? PRODUCER: And we are live in 5, 4, 3, 2. Take that. We have an interesting update. The Zenith team is back in, with Grant Irvine replacing his brother Kevin in a dangerous mid-air exchange after the Zenith plane was damaged. This stuff checked? Nervous? Aren't you supposed to be upstairs flying? Co-pilot, remember? Now get going and win this thing. You got it. Thanks. Ready to be dropped on three, two, one. ANNOUNCER (OVER PA): [WHOOPING] Grant Irvine is back in the race! I repeat, Grant Irvine is back in for the Zenith team! GRANT (OVER RADIO): Systems check? KEVIN (OVER RADIO): Everything seems to be OK. Looking good on all screens. Kev, what the hell are you doing? The hell are you doing flying my plane? Touche. All right, guys. Look, I got to make up seven minutes here. Yeah, well, that'll take time and fuel. Well, right now I got more fuel than time. Grant, you're not going to catch the pack from here. You'll be lucky to finish the damn race. I'm not interested in finishing. I want to win. Well, now's a good time to check your oxygen, bro. It sounds like you need some. Kev, can you plan a high altitude trajectory that will keep us at mach 2 with minimal fuel burn? Stand by. Got it. Sending your coordinates. Man, your face is going to be in an oxygen mask for a long time. She's also going to be very skittish above 80,000. You're going to be flying right at the edge of flame out and stall speed. (SIGHING) I don't have a choice, do I? GRANT (OVER RADIO): All right. 50,000 feet, just as planned. Approaching speeds of mach 2. That gives me an ETA to catch the pack in four hours and fifteen minutes. Looks like another long night ahead of me, guys. TY: So, what do you think? BANNON: I don't think Irvine's got a chance in hell to close that gap. [BOOM] TRINA (OVER RADIO): Hey, Grant, you OK? GRANT (OVER RADIO): Yeah. Yeah, the stick got away from me. It's all good. It's all good now. What happened? Be careful at this altitude. The air's still thin, your air speed is less than 160 knots. Just relax. Let the autopilot take over for a second. So how's Kevin? He's fine. Asleep. I got you on my flight screen? So how am I doing? How are you doing? You know, compared to my brother? Are you two ever going to grow up and cease this absurd brotherly competition? I doubt that. That's what I thought. So you date pilots or what? We're in the middle of a race and you're hitting on me. A guy's got to do what a guy's got to do, you know? Right. Except I don't date pilots. 3/4 of the way through the race as the jets approach Vladivostok. From there, the final leg across the Pacific and back here to Los Angeles. So right now, we have Xiang in front with Diedrich in second and Rose in third. Way behind the pack but catching up fast, Grant Irvine and the Zenith team. So who will it be? Who will fly over these Colosseum walls the winner of $25 million and champion of this year's Transcon? Will be current race leader Hirosho Xiang? David Diedrich and Team Mabach from Germany? Will Catherine Rose become the first female to win at Transcon? Or will Irvine and the Zenith team come from way behind and close the gap in the hunt for victory? Everyone is going to slow down before we turn north. KEVIN (OVER RADIO): That's where you're going to make your move. GRANT (OVER RADIO): If I come out of there first or second, I'll be set for the final leg. Yeah, not if they catch you again. I'll open up the lead. Grant, they're going to attack you again and again, all the way back to LA. Better chance of holding first place on the final leg than taking it from someone else, right? [MUSIC PLAYING] RACE DIRECTOR 1 (OVER RADIO): Irvine's going to pass on your right! Right! Right! Right! He's dropping! He's dropping! Act two, Grant. BANNON: And Grant Irvine passes the Russian team to move all by himself into fourth place. All the way from nine minutes back. What a race. Kev, do you see this? See what they're doing? Yeah, I know what they're doing. They're going to keep you boxed in back there all day long until they make their break for the finish line. So, you got a plan? Yeah, I got something. What? I'll dig a hole between them. BANNON: Oh, what a terrific battle as Irvine splits between Rose and Diedrich to move into second place! All right. One more move, Grant. [PHONE RINGING] Network? Hello? This guy is ripping through the pack. Network wants you to shift coverage. Get as many cameras as you can on Irvine's jet. OK, listen up! I want all available coverage shifted to Grant Irvine and Team Zenith, pronto! That's Xiang in front of you. Yeah, I got him. But he's got turbo-- I said I got him. All right, then. If you've got him, smoke him. I'm going to full burn. RACE DIRECTOR 4 (OVER RADIO): They're making connect! Get your head out of the way! BANNON: And there it is! Grant Irvine and the Zenith team moving up to take their first lead in the race. Just seconds away now from Vladivostok and the final turn east for the final leg of the race. Grant, you've got to get off the afterburners or you're never going to make refuel. Copy that. Bringing them down, little brother. RACE DIRECTOR 1 (OVER RADIO): Irvine's slowing down. Now's the time to regain the lead. Yeah. I'm going to take a little detour with our friend, Diedrich. What? What? Cut, cut, cut. They're off the flight path. Yes, I know! Look, that's not just restricted airspace, it's civilian airspace. - I know! TY: If we don't get them out of there, we're gonna have the FAA, the NTSB so far up our ass-- Ooh, the big, scary FAA. Fuck 'em. TRINA (OVER RADIO): Grant, are you having fun yet? RACE DIRECTOR 1 (OVER RADIO): Diedrich, what are you doing? Diedrich! Zenith and Mabach pilots, that's enough barnstorming for one day. Return to the flight path. That's an order. Do you copy? They're not answering. What do you want me to do? I'd start by not shifting coverage. If they lose control and crash, it'll torch everything in a five block radius. Yeah, it's Vladivostok. Who cares? KEVIN (OVER RADIO): All right, Grant. We got our race in this year. Send back at 50,000 feet. All right, we've got the slalom coming up. Hey, Grant. Go! Hope your little stunt didn't just get us disqualified. - Don't worry! - Hey, the operative word is us. We're all in this race together. Sorry. Yeah, well, somebody could have been killed. I said I was sorry. All right? Don't do it again. All right. I'm only telling you because I think you've got a chance of winning this race. Why, you afraid I'm going to blow it? That's right! So quit trying to prove something and just fly the jet. All right. TRINA (OVER RADIO): OK, this is it. This is the narrowest, steepest, and probably the most difficult slalom to ever exist. Be careful, Grant. See, they gave us great racing action and we never cut away. We never even flinched. PRODUCER: All right. Listen up, people. It's that time again. Cue playback. Get those cameras up, because we are live in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 . One last slalom section before the final stretch back home. It's Irvine still in the lead with Diedrich a close second, Xiang in third, and Rose in fourth place. Over the Pacific Ocean now, as the race jets are just moments away from the toughest part of the entire air race, the final slalom course. Race designers tell us the turns and dives in the slalom are rated between five and seven G-Forces. At those levels, pilots can experience impaired flight skills, tunnel vision, then complete blackout. That can mean a 16-ton race jet with the pilot passed out at the controls. An extremely dangerous possibility, but Transcon always saves the best for last. The slalom course consists of 10 pylons set 10 miles apart. The pilots enter the slalom course, circle each pylon, and exit back onto the flight path. If, however, the pilot misses one of the pylons, that adds 30 seconds each to his overall time. Well, guess who's back? Our friend Diedrich. KEVIN (OVER RADIO): Plus more. Take a look. With the rest of the pack not much further behind. You got a plan? Yeah, I got 'em. So when I hit the starting gate to the slalom, it's going to be a sustained burn all the way until I cross the finish line. KEVIN (OVER RADIO): Sustained burn for that long? Man, that's crazy. We're way too far away. You'll overheat your engines for sure. GRANT (OVER RADIO): Kev, engines will make it. Barely, but they'll make it! That's your big plan? Come on, Kev. Who are you to going to trust, the engines or your own brother? KEVIN (OVER RADIO): If you overheat, the whole pack is just going to coast right by you. GRANT (OVER RADIO): If we don't try, we lose without ever knowing. ANNOUNCER (OVER PA): Ladies and gentlemen, this is it, the final moment you've been waiting for. OK, here we go. Now it's Xiang challenging for first place. Three wide as they hit the final balloon. Trouble coming out of the slalom for Hirosho Xiang. Looks like he's going into a stall. And Hirosho Xiang and the Chinese team are out of the race! Russians and Canadians each miss a turn. And Catherine Rose has bailed out as the Russian team made contact with her jet. And now the Russians are in the water! It's down to two pilots! That'll leave Diedrich and Irvine left to battle it out for first. It's down to two pilots, one finish line. Will it be David Diedrich and Team Mabach or will it be Grant Irvine and the Zenith team? And Diedrich takes the lead by a length. And here comes Irvine fighting to take back the lead seconds from the line! Come on, Grant! You got three minutes from that Colosseum. You've got just enough fuel at full burners. [WARNING ALARM BEEPING] Race tower, Diedrich has a cockpit fire! Eject seat failed! He can not eject! He's air trapped! Roger that. We're scrambling ground crews now. Tower, he's going to burn up in there! You're 30 seconds away from victory. Race tower! Race tower, do you copy? Race tower! Irvine, rescue are en route. Make your turn for the Colosseum. The race is yours. Tower, Diedrich is going to drown. He's wrapped up in the 'chute! We'll get him, Irvine. Right now, there's 100,000 people waiting here to see you cross my finish line. Your finish line, Bannon? Hey, Kevin? Go. Tell the team they did a hell of a job. Grant, what are you doing? I'm doing the right thing. You're seconds away. And here we are, seconds away from the finish line! And the winner of this year's Transcon race is-- Nobody. Oh. No, he didn't. [MUSIC PLAYING] Turn us around right now. Hold on. [SPLASHING] Are you injured? I think so. My leg. - Does it feel broken? I can't tell. GRANT: Just don't worry, OK? Rescue's coming. Oh, I got you. DIEDRICH: Over here. Who won the race? GRANT: Nobody. [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [PHONE RINGING] [SIRENS WAILING] His right leg is broken, so watch out the right leg. OK. One, two, three. Thanks for coming back to help me. No problem, buddy. No problem. But I tell you what. If my jet didn't catch fire, I would have won the race. Hey, get out of here before I break your other leg, huh? You'll be fine, brother. You'll be fine. DIEDRICH: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop. Thanks, man. Thanks. Any time. Come on, get him out! Yeah? So you quit the race and turned down $25 million to save another pilot. TRINA (OVER RADIO): Hey, Grant, maybe next time you might ask us first. I guess we found something more important than winning, huh? And the money. GRANT (OVER RADIO): No, I wouldn't go that far. I'll see you guys back at the hangar, all right? KEVIN: $25 Million? BANNON: That's right. Just a one way ticket. One way ticket. First class, Munich. Mm-hmm, that's right. A window seat. Vince. Was just-- just calling you. Taking a trip? No, no. I was, uh-- just, uh-- I see. Getting my stuff together. I understand that you have some problems with the $35 million that you owe. No, it's not a problem, just a little delay. No problem. Chris, this is sounding a lot more like a problem than a delay. No, it's just that [CLEARING THROAT] since there was no official winner of the race, the network just wants to sort things out contractually with the attorneys. Attorneys? Right, the attorneys. Nothing good ever comes from attorneys. You got that right! It's like the old joke at the bottom of the ocean. I'll have the $25 million for you by the end of next week. It's $35 million. BANNON: Oh, Vin-- [GUN COCKS] GRANT (VOICEOVER): When I was a kid, I had this dream, right? A dream where I was flying, a dream I thought I lost. But my brother helped me find it again. In that split second when I knew he wasn't going to make it, I wasn't thinking about the money. I wasn't thinking about the race. All I could think about was, here is someone who at one time had that same dream and lost it. You see, in the end, our dreams are not about money. They're not about winning and they're not about fame. In the end, our dreams are about living and the choices we make. [MUSIC PLAYING]
