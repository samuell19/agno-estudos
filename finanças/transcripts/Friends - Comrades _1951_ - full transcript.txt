"Young Talent Show". There! - Let the storm rage as it will - I won't let go of the wheel! - Bravely I'll spur on my horse, and rush forward at full speed! - Beware! I'll catch up to you! Get rid of that traffic light! - Are you late? Well, no problem! You can climb in here with us. - The best airplane ever will carry you upon its wing! - Come on! Jump up, don't be scared! - I won't ride upon a wing! - Don't be shy! You'll feel at home here. - But I do not even know you. - As if that was any reason. - What, then, should I call you? - Zina. - Well, my own name is Chizhov. - I'm Pyzhov. - And I'm Ryzhov. Our names are hard to forget. - Chizhik-Pyzhik!* What a laugh! * comical song about a little drunk bird - I do not see what's so funny! - We've no tie to Chizhik-Pyzhik! - I'm not Chizhik, but Chizhov! - I'm not Pyzhik, but Pyzhov! - It does not make any difference. - Speaking for myself, excuse me, I attend the Leningrad Nahimov Naval School and will be a naval officer. - I'm a top pupil of the fifth company of the Kazan Suvorov Military School. I'll also be an officer! - While I, on the other hand, attend the Yaroslavl Arts and Crafts School. I'll be a master mechanic, and perhaps an engineer. - Yeah? I'm from School #20, I've still got so many years left... I want to join the ballet, and take on important roles. - You've got talent, then? - You bet! - Well, and what about your studies? - Oh, I get it! You're Poindexters! - What?! - Say those words again! - Who's Poindexter? Out with it! - You doll with a bow behind! - Attention! The Young Talent Show is taking place on the open stage in the children's village. Today is the last day of the show. - Will you let me through? I want to catch the talent show. - Miss Snooty! - What if the three of us also went on stage? Let's go! - Well! We could do just as well! - We could play anything! - "Moon is Shining"*, or a march! * Popular Russian folk song - With a comb? - Possibly. - Your ballet doesn't scare us, either! - If need be - we could dance, also! - There goes Zina-ballerina! - What do you want? To sign up? - Yes, I have prepared a dance. - You'll be up as... number 12. What is your family name? - Zina Zhukova. You got it? 1st-of-May Street, number 9. I danced not so long ago. I was cast as the Swan Princess. And even the chief musician said to me: "You have talent! And a talent that's quite rare." - Bravo, Zhukova! One more thing, I have got to see your schoolmarks! - I'll improve them. - No. Hold on, now! "3/5". "2/5". "2/5" again! Zina! That's a whole three subjects! Here, I'll give you this advice! Try this summer, to improve the three marks in these subjects. Never mind! Don't hang your head! There is no need to feel wronged! I will sign you up for autumn. Until next time, Zinaida! - Poor thing! - Yes! Locked out! - Pity! - Of course! A real shame! - Brothers! We must help her! - There she is! - Let's go over! - Right on! - Forward march! - Zina! We will help you! - Help me with what? - With what we can. - We'll help you, by end of summer, to prepare three subjects for school. - So that they will go and raise three marks on your school-report. - Zina! There we go! It's about time! Things will go quite well, I'm sure! - Now, in honor of our friendship I will offer a salute! - Oh! Oh, he'll sink down to the bottom! It is very deep there! - Odd! - Yes! It's strange. - You'd better undress, my friend! - Hey! Yoohoo! You, on the shore! Come here, guys! - Coming! - Running! - Here it is! Unbroken, whole. - Unbroken?! Right! Let's take a look! Good as new, now. Here, take it! The keys are now tied to a string! - Can't divide it? Here, just look! We'll divide the chocolate bar evenly into four parts. Here you go, this one is yours! Well, Poindexters, let's sit right here and get busy with this chocolate. - Oh, you're not at all Poindexters. I should not have said that, really. It was only silly words. Do not be angry with me! - Okay. We don't hold a grudge. - Now, let's get busy, brothers! From the 20th of the month, we will start our study sessions! "We are friends in leisure time, in our training and at work, We will always help a friend who's troubled by a problem." - Good! I'll start on the topic which has not been covered yet. On the high bank of the Danube towered high a battle fortress - proud, unapproachable Izmail. Look at Izmail! A whole page it covers! But... Izmail could not sleep that night. Two hours yet were left before the dawn. There was silence, sinister and solid. Then, a signal! At the rooster's crowing, a rocket brightly lit up the sky! Cannonades thundered and howled. The walls trembled from their pounding. From the walls, the Turks cried "Yi Allah!" From their cauldron they poured out boiling tar. "Come on, brothers, one, two, together!". The first lines have already been disarmed. And onto the walls, like a mighty mountain, crashed a Heroic "Hurrah!" The banners flowed into the courtyard. And Suvorov himself rode in on his horse! He shouted: "Thank you, brothers, we'll fight next time just like today! The stone walls are fallen. Izmail is at your feet! Well done! God have mercy on us!" Okay, you can take a break! (The tale was about the storming of the Izmail fortress in 1790, a decisive victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1792) - Well, let's not waste any time, and turn to a new topic. Of seas both large and small, of dams and of canals. Here, look! The Volga and the Don - sister and brother in friendship are tied forever! The land where these rivers merge will be fabulously rich! There are so many fruits and grapes growing everywhere in this land! Steppes all the way to Stalingrad will be fully covered with wheat! Weirs will lie across the Volga! And the river's flowing might The unprecedented turbines Will be turning - what a sight! All fields and cities there girdled with wires everywhere! Into every distant corner electric currents will run! The sun, looking at the planet, will be blinking from the light! We are all done for today. We'll continue tomorrow, 1 p.m. - Mom! I'll open the door! Hello, Ryzhik! - How's your health? Everything's set up. That's good. What're you writing in your notebook? - I did not finish two problems. - Ah! That is a pity! I will go and hide your notebook. Meanwhile, you can solve this problem. Do not write its number down. A certain schoolboy, one might say, came home from his school at 1. Took an hour to eat his lunch. Then, for the afternoon "dead hour", lay down to rest for an hour. Then for almost two hours, slept. And he got up about 5. Not even making up the bed, at exactly 5 he went for a walk. Then, at 7, he rolled in for an hour at the skating rink. He stayed there til 9 p.m., and, after a tasty dinner, He forgot about his lessons, and at 10, lay down to sleep. - Three, five, ten... - Alright. There's no need to count! I'll answer it myself. He who lives not by the clock he, who spends his time in vain, will receive, as a result, and then, just barely, a "2/5". Now, let's move from jokes to work. Clean your hands from the chalk. Do not spend your time in vain - get your notebook ready. Sit. July 23, Exercises 364 August 2, Exercises 136 [Geography - pp. 155-160. History - p.65] [Tomorrow at 11 o'clock: exam] - Well? Worried? - Aren't you? It's not that easy to pass an exam! - To take an exam in three subjects The teacher requested of her, in front of the whole school board. - We know. Here she is! Look! - "5/5" in everything! You see?! - I see! - So much for "Chizhik-Pyzhik"! "The autumn show of children's amateur performances. Participants: The "Friendship" ensemble consisting of Pyzhov, Chizhov, Ryzhov and Zhukova." - Let us check a year from now who will grow by what amount. We can leave our marks right here. Here's a red pencil. - Make the pencil mark precisely! - Do not breathe! - I'm not breathing! - Look! Our Ryzhik is a real giant! - Come on, Ryzhik, lower yourself! Remove that suitcase! - Careful! Our tickets are in there. - Well, until we meet next summer! Yes! It's time! Time to go home! Come visit us in the winter! We'll have a New Year Tree. Yeah? Attention! Make your way, without delay, to the departure platform! Goodbye! Goodbye! THE END subs by Alex & Eus347 (Jan 2017) revised by Niffiwan (Jul 2023)
