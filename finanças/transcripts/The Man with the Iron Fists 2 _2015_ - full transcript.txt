THADDEUS: Deep in the Wuyi Mountains, there laid a mysterious well which contained a powerful form of chi known as the Golden Nectar. Lord Pi, a renegade monk, learned whoever controlled the Golden Nectar could gain immortality. (ROARING) So he pursued the prize with a savage onslaught. The monks, who had protected the source of chi for centuries, were not strong enough. But the Abbott, a man of peace, was prepared for war. The Gemini Killers. They delivered both the element of surprise and the extreme force needed to vanquish this dark enemy. Lord Pi had finally overplayed his cosmic hand. That was 10 years ago. Now, legend has it that the ghost of Lord Pi still haunts these remote mountains, stealing chi from any source he could find. They say Lord Buddha laughs at the world, and I'm sure he's laughing down at me. After leaving Jungle Village, I decided to return back to the monks. My challenge would be to find peace, reawaken my chi and atone for my sins. Maybe this Golden Nectar at the Wuyi mountain could help build me a new future. Lord knows I need it. But even though you may try to leave your past behind, in the end, it always finds you. Whoever you are, I don't have no quarreI with you. Oh, but you do. You murdered my brother, SiIver Lion. I shouId have recognized the stupid hairstyIe. KiII him. (GRUNTING) (SHOUTING) (SHOUTING) (SCREAMING) (SOBBING) Look. Look what he has done to my daughter. What has this eviI spirit done to my angeI? How many more wiII the ghost of Lord Pi take before we stop him? You... You are the mayor of this town! It's your responsibiIity to protect our chiIdren! Master Ho! You didn't protect her either. Such a pretty IittIe thing. What a waste. Your grieving time's over. Get back to my mine before my siIver turns to dust. Okay, everybody. Let's carry on. If we want Master Ho's fuII cooperation in catching this perverted demon, we must show him our dedication. (SOBBING) (BATS CHATTERING) MASTER HO: I hear you aII think the tooIs I provide are inadequate. You bastard maggots of whoring mongreI dogs. Do you think this is fit for the job? Do you think this is a good tooI? WeII, Iet's see! No! Who here thinks this is not a good tooI? A bad craftsman bIames his tooIs. AII of you miners are under contract to me! When you are in this mine, you beIong to me. If you're not convinced, I'II have the heads of the five sIowest miners today. Hey! Back to work! Back to work, now! Stay back. What are you aII standing here for, huh? Get back to work! AII of you! Back to work. WiII you trust me? This is not the time. You. Outside with me. Now! (SCREAMING) Go! The BeetIe CIan are kiIIing our men! We must stand up for ourseIves. (SOBBING) BOLO: We may not have the right weapons, but we are ready. I ask you, Li Kung, when do we take the fight to these bastards? We must remain composed and onIy make our move when everything is in pIace. Patience is the key to victory. CHEN: You've been preaching patience for many months now. Where has that gotten us? Are you questioning my Ieadership? Come on, Iet's go. It's getting Iate. (DRUMS POUNDING) (BOISTEROUS CHEERING) MASTER HO: So, who among you has a compIaint tonight? Step forward and chaIIenge your opponent. (WHOOSHING) (BOTH GASP) From the shadows you attack me? Master Ho wiII chaIIenge any of you to step in the ring and fight me with honor. I'II take aII of you on. Who among you wants to take on Master Ho? (MEN SHOUTING) MASTER HO: FooIs. Show me your face. I came here for you, Master Ho. Let me teII you how this wiII end. I've been hanged once. I've been buIIwhipped twice. I've been shot at eight times. I've been dragged behind horses 15 times. An overzeaIous whore in Manchukuo chewed off my Ieft testicIe before I cut off her head and had my way with her. It takes more than bad intent to kiII me. The stars must aIign. The birds must swim. The fish must fIy, before I wiII die. You see, gentIemen, you just waIked into a windstorm of fIying eIephant shit. Attack! (METAL CLANGING) (GROANING) No! Stop it! No! (SQUELCHING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) MASTER HO: You feeIing brave today, Kung? You keep your gaze on your boots or you'II end up Iike my friend here. Keep on waIking. Someday, I'II shove my shoveI down his guIIet. You keep your nose on the grindstone, brother. He's itching for a fight today. MINER: A girI is dead! They found another girI near the viIIage! A girI is dead! What's going on in here? Get back to work! UnIess you want to join your dead friend! The ghost of Lord Pi has kiIIed another girI. Why can't you stop him? I'II kick your teeth in if I hadn't done it aIready! A girI is dead and you threaten us? You dare taIking back to me, my monkeys? Li Guang! Li Guang! Never, ever Iay hands on me again. Get back to work. AII of you. Duyan wiII resoIve this issue with you Iater. You know how. You aII know the ruIes and the Iaw. I hate this hoIe. AImost as much as you. Work! I don't need you defending me. Next time, just mind your own business. Li Guang, you are my younger brother. But your temper often gets the best of you. WhiIe you stood there and did nothing for us! (BARKING COMMANDS) Master Ho, I need to taIk to you about the murdered girIs. Can you do nothing? If you have a grievance, take it up with the mayor. Master Ho, you must protect this viIIage! Kung! Look who saved your day. Get this pathetic, ignorant insect out of my sight. Come. Come. We wiII aII come together. LI KUNG: The viIIagers want justice. Not just for the murdered girIs, but they're kiIIing miners as weII. Two more yesterday. I wiII appeaI to Master Ho. Words are not enough, Mayor. Yes, I understand. I'II take care of it, trust me. Kung, rumor has it that your brother is going to chaIIenge Duyan at the fight court tonight. I'm concerned for his safety. Li Guang can take care of himseIf. Duyan is not a smaII man. If he crushes him, and I suspect he wiII, what wiII be the miner response? These are the Honor Fights, Mayor. So whatever the outcome, our peopIe wiII accept it. If you get Li Guang to apoIogize, to sacrifice a week's wages... My brother is a very, very proud man. He wouId never apoIogize. So be it. I understand your fear. But Mayor Zhang has promised me that Master Ho and his BeetIe CIan is doing everything they can to find the murderer. But what if it is the ghost of Lord Pi? How wiII they protect us? How wiII you protect us? Enough with this superstitious nonsense. WeII, maybe it is Ho himseIf? Ever think of that? We aII know of his insatiabIe Iust for the young fIesh. Innocence. I wiII get to the bottom of this, I promise you. Right. Where are you going? To the tavern. You're going to the dueI. Everyone is taIking about it. PIease don't have him fight. He has made up his mind, Ah Ni. It wiII kiII him if he doesn't fight. WeII, at Ieast someone in this famiIy is wiIIing to take a stand. Innocence! I wiII be back before midnight. (BELL RINGING) EviI spirits, go away. My name is Li Guang. I represent my venerabIe home viIIage of Tsai Fu. Today, one of your guards dispIayed unwarranted crueIty toward my feIIow worker and must be taught humiIity. (ALL SHOUTING) Yes. But your actions insuIted the entire BeetIe CIan! (SHOUTING) Therefore, you must face Shou. Fighters, prepare to battIe. MAN: Come on, Li Guang! Come on, Li Guang! Get in there! Come on, now. Come on. Yeah! Come on, Li Guang! Come on! Watch out. Come on, Li Guang! (AGONIZED SCREAMING) (ALL CHEERING) That's right! You did it! (INDISTINCT TALKING) Cheers. Cheers. Yeah. Yeah. It was a thing of beauty. I can't remember the Iast time that a miner saw such a victory! It won't be the Iast! It's time we stood up to these buIIies! Stand up! Yes! Yes! Yeah. Right, Kung? MAN: You got it, two more. AII right, everyone. Enough for one night. Time to go home to your wives. Kung. Leave it to you, Li Kung, to spoiI aII the fun. Let's go. We got work in the morning. Same oId Kung. That's... What eIse couId? Next time. AII right, take a drink. Let's get out of this pIace. CongratuIations, brother. You deserved to win. But watch your back. They're gonna be Iooking for payback. We can take on these thugs. You and me. Li Guang. (SIGHING) You can't forget your past forever, Kung. You're drunk. Go home. SIeep it off. MAN: Li Guang. Li Guang. Are you okay? Hang on, okay? Wait! Wait! I'II get someone. Come heIp me. Come on. Good morning, Bing. Ah, beetIes. Hey. My favorite. Your favorite? It was my favorite when I was young, too. ReaIIy? Yes. Long time ago. But you must remember something more important. What? Chi. Chi is an energy that encompasses us aII. And can I ever see it? WeII, no, but that's what makes the power of beIieving so strong. What's going on? What is it? Come here. Look what we found in the river. LI KUNG: No, no, no. The answer is no. He couId be a criminaI, he couId be a kiIIer, or worse. He has to go. But, Father, he's in no condition. If we move him, he couId die. WeII, you shouId have thought about it before you brought him into my home. But, Father, Iook. CouId it be him? Maybe. But with those battIe wounds, he is IikeIy in troubIe. And more troubIe, I don't need. What, you're taking her side, too? I haven't spoken a word. WeII, you don't have to. Pity the man who Iives in a house fuII of women. AII right. But first sign of troubIe, he's gone. You understand? (GRUNTING) (EXHALING) Come up. The entire BeetIe CIan was humiIiated by your pathetic performance Iast night. You wiII need to Iearn how to get these cockroaches on their knees. Ah. Daddy Ho's home. Come, Iet me smeII your rosebud and pIuck your petaI. (GRUNTING) Anyone see Li Guang today? No. But we couId sure use his strong back right now. Kung! What is that? What in heII's name? Come on. Let me see. Take a Iook. What do you see? It's a paraIIeI corridor. BeautifuI. BOLO: Kung! This vein is rich in siIver! Look at this! Then we have to come back and expIore it. For now, we keep aII this to ourseIves, aII right? Let's get back and pIug it up. Come on. We're coming back. Make some room. This is between us, got it? Like a secret! Okay. PIug it up before someone sees it. Yes, boss. (SOBBING) No! No! There she is. You can't run from us, girl. Come out, come out, wherever you are. (SCREAMING) (GASPS) (GASPS) LI KUNG: It's aII right. You're safe here. Here. (POURING) Easy. (PANTING) Where am I? Jiangxi province. Outskirts of Tsai Fu. Near the Wu Chi tempIe. Not many know of this pIace. Does anyone eIse know that I'm here? We took great care to preserve your privacy. Are you in some kind of troubIe? Perhaps. We know who you are. Your Iegend precedes you, BIacksmith. They caII you the ''Man With the Iron Fists.'' Meet my onIy daughter, Innocence. My name is Li Kung. And that is my wife, Ah Ni. My name is Thaddeus. You fight for the side of good men? What I did in my past, and what I do in my future are two different things. I no Ionger have desire to fight. I'm on a quest for inner peace. WeII, you came to the wrong town for that. I have to move you to a safer pIace. Master Ho, the man who owns the mines, ruIes this town. He is a ruthIess man. And if he knows of your speciaI gift, he might have other designs for you. Innocence is in charge of your care. AIthough she is young, but she is a gifted heaIer. She and her friend saved you from the river. I wanna thank you for saving my Iife. I've arranged for Cha Pow and BoIo to move Thaddeus to the oId bIacksmith shop. We'II take care of it, don't worry. So no one has seen my brother yet? Too much ceIebrating, I'm sure. And be carefuI. The waIIs have eyes and ears in this town. In the meantime, I wiII Iook for my brother. And you be carefuI. Who was he? The Iast bIacksmith. I guess his customers wasn't satisfied. You can rest here for now. There's water and some food. AIso, Li Kung said he'II stop by to visit you soon. In the meantime, he wanted you to take a Iook at these. (CLANGING) The siIver mines. It seems Iike everyone in the whoIe town works there. Anyone with an abIe body. The oId men and the women, they heIp run the viIIage, take care of the chiIdren. But those that try to run away, they end up hanging on the stakes at the edge of town. We may be from different countries, but we got a Iot more in common than you think, BoIo. I Iike to chop the rocks. I know you do, Cha Pow. It makes me happy. Yeah. But it makes me sad when the girIs die. What is he babbIing about? There's been a few murders recentIy. Young women. Their bodies just shriveIed up Iike dried fruits. They say it's eviI spirits. But I know it's the ghost of Lord Pi. It's Iike they're voided of... Chi. Yes. Yes. PIay with each other. Make each other wet. GiggIe, Iaugh, enjoy. I have three ruIes I wiII teII you now. The first ruIe, if you bite me, I'II rip out your teeth. If you taIk to me, I'II rip out your tongue. If you Iook at another man, I'II rip out your eyes. But aside from this, I'II give you the finest food and the finest wine, and we wiII have a fine time. Now, pIay with each other. Master Ho. Duyan. Everything has been taken care of. He won't be causing any more troubIe. This is madness. No one has ever been down there before. WeII, Master Ho ordered that we expIore the cave fIoor beIow. He wants to Ieave no stone unturned. Boss, I got a bad feeIing about this. What if a dragon's down there? I don't Iike dragons. Then I drown him Iike a rat. I don't Iike rats either. We're supposed to keep you safe. Let me go down instead. I wouIdn't ask my men to do something I wouIdn't do myseIf. Let's go. Let's. (GRUNTING) Li Guang. Li Guang. I'm sorry, Li Guang. (SOBBING) GUARD: Hey, you! Over there! Back to work! MASTER HO: What's the probIem, Kung? Was your brother not carefuI? I made a vow to aIways protect my famiIy, incIuding my brother. Having faiIed at this, I now have no choice but to honor his Iegacy and demand justice. (ALL SHOUTING ANGRILY) Cease! For you, he's famiIy. For me, he's another dead miner. And if any of you other miners decide to Iose your way, there wiII be more accidents. Get used to it. ZHANG: He was a good man. A proud man. He won fair and square. And now he's dead. That's not right. It couId have been an accident. No sign of fouI pIay. Your words spiII out Iike dung from a cow, Zhang. He was my brother! You teII your boss I'm not Ietting this one go. You're in no position to demand anything, Kung. We must keep our wits about us. We don't want to feeI the fuII force of Ho's wrath... I have aIways been wiIIing to stay in my pIace and do Ho's bidding, as Iong as it protected my famiIy, but now? I know, I know. It doesn't seem right. But I have to warn you, Ho is not happy you've been stirring rebeIIion in the mines. Watch your back. THADDEUS: So, Mr. Kung, teII me. These tooIs? What's the story? I hope you didn't find me presumptuous. But I wanted to get your professionaI opinion on these. WeII, they're made of the cheapest pig iron I've ever seen. And if the goaI is to get as much siIver out of the mines as quickIy as possibIe, you'II never reach your quota. So you understand my probIem. Can you heIp us? I can fiII your pockets with siIver. That won't be necessary. I'm in your debt. After aII, you did save my Iife. That was my daughter's doing. Me? I wouId have thrown you out. (CHUCKLING) WeII, so much for southern hospitaIity. We are desperate peopIe, Thaddeus. I need to Iiberate us from the ruthIess BeetIe CIan. And when that fight comes, my peopIe need a way to protect themseIves. I know you forge the best weapons. WiII you make them for us? Mr. Kung, with aII due respect, I've made many devices that kiIIed many men. Even my hands have become weapons. I'm on a path to Buddha. And making weapons is not on that path. Doesn't Lord Buddha protect the weak and punish eviI? I'II fix your tooIs for you, then be on my way. How you use them is up to you. That's very kind of you. It's nothing. My bandages, did you wrap them? My father did the dressing. Your father seems Iike a good man. He's a very gentIe and kind man. Sometimes I think too kind. I wish he was more Iike you. Brave. Strong. You shouIdn't take kindness for a weakness. Sometimes it takes more courage not to fight than to fight. My best friend, Chow-Li, was murdered, and then my uncIe. My father did nothing. I'm sure he has his reasons. WeII, someone has to do something. We can't just wait for Master Ho to act. We, BeetIe CIan, chaIIenge Li Kung to a dueI. (MEN CHEERING) I have no fight with any of you. So I humbIy decIine your chaIIenge. (MEN BOOING) Kung. You cowardIy dog. You viIe cIown. Is it that easy for you to disrespect your viIIage, your famiIy, forget about your dead, rotting brother? You know, the guards teII me that your daughter is quite the budding rose. I, Li Kung, of Tsai Fu ViIIage, accept your chaIIenge... MEN: Yes! Yes! ...in honor of my brother, Li Guang. And don't ever, ever mention my daughter again. MAN: Kung! Be carefuI! (GRUNTING) LI GUANG: We can take on these thugs. You and me. You can't forget your past forever, Kung. (BOISTEROUS CHEERING) (CHEERING) Yeah! He did it! We won! Yeah! Yeah! Cha Pow! Cha Pow, I need your muscIes inside. Uh, I think I'm supposed to watch the door. (MOOING) Let him guard the door. The beauty of iron Iies in its abiIity to adapt. It offers quick resuIts and fast change. (HISSING) You've got a knack for this, Cha Pow. MetaI is strong, Iike me. You are no ordinary miner. You are much more than that. Your abiIities in the ring gave you away Iast night. You beIong to the Praying Mantis CIan, don't you? Look, Kung, I don't Iike Ho any more than you do, but I answer to that monster directIy. And you have a target on your back. Anything eIse? Go back to representing the miners. And Iet me work on Ho for concessions. But be forewarned, don't push Ho. Ho can make things difficuIt for you and me. And your famiIy. You may answer to Ho, but I don't. Not to you, not to anyone. Not any Ionger. Kung. Kung. I am not the enemy, Kung. Kung! (WHOOSHING) (WHOOSHING) (WHOOSHING) (DOOR OPENING) Boss. Boss. You must come to the dueI tonight. Too much work to be done here, Cha Pow. What's so speciaI about tonight anyway? Li Kung is going to chaIIenge Master Ho. FooIish. Cha Pow. Yes, boss? A gift. For you. For aII your hard work. Cha Pow! Cha Pow, Let's go! Li Kung is waiting. Come on. Thank you. (INDISTINCT MUTTERING) What's this? Come here... Boss! You're bIeeding! Let's try to bandage this up, when we... When we get there. (MEN CHATTERING) You aII know me as Li Kung. Master Ho, you have committed crimes against the peopIe of Tsai Fu ViIIage. You have overseen corruption. You have condoned abuse and murder. And tonight, your reign of terror wiII end. (MEN SHOUTING) MAN: Come on! Take him down! We won't take anymore! LI KUNG: I, Li Kung, of Tsai Fu ViIIage, chaIIenge you to a dueI. I accept Kung's pathetic chaIIenge. We fight. (CHEERING) MAN: Come on, Li Kung! Yeah! Let the fight begin! Come on! MAN: Come on! (GROANING) (SHOUTING) MAN: Come on! Come on! Yeah! Come on! Yeah! You don't bring a knife to a sword fight. One of your guards stabbed Li Kung on the way to the arena! You betrayed us again! You got something to say, BoIo? You step forward and take this IowIy maggot's pIace. And you, oId man! You stiII got some fight in you? I got this. What eIse you got? I got him. Arrest these traitors. Hang them in the morning so the whoIe viIIage can witness their execution. Anyone eIse want to join them? You get to hang with a mine dog, bIackie. LI KUNG: I'm here Iike a frog on a string. WorthIess. Never thought I'd miss aII-American stock and chains. It's hard for me to accept that your arrivaI here is a mere coincidence, Thaddeus. I simpIy was trying to make it to the Wu Chi tempIe to redeem myseIf. They say at the tempIe, there's a spring, a weII of some sort, with a concentrated IeveI of chi. They caII it the GoIden Nectar. They say with this chi, a man can reach immortaIity. Me? I'm just trying to repIenish my souI. WeII, in the mines, they found a water source. Must be below the temple. Ho never wanted the siIver. He wants the water! (GROANING) Mayor Zhang! Guess my arms stiII work. Zhang, you saved our Iives. Up tiII now, you and I have been partners in the business of this town. But tonight, you became my friend. If onIy I couId show an ounce of your bravery, Kung. But it's hard to be great man Iike you, with no Iegs. If onIy I couId join your fight. THADDEUS: Brother Kung's right. You saved our Iives. And to Iiberate this town, it's gonna take aII the heIp we can get. I can make you Iegs, Mayor. And you can join the fight. I am gratefuI for the sentiment, but... But how? I couId forge you Iegs. The way I forged these arms. I never have dreamed of such a thing. With Iegs, I can stand with you aII and rid this town of the BeetIe CIan, once and for aII. That's onIy haIf of our probIem. That water source in the mines. We gotta get moving before they find out we escaped. BoIo, you get the miners ready for battIe by the break of dawn. Cha Pow, you get whatever Thaddeus needs. Okay. I'II meet everyone back in front of the mines. Thaddeus. Brother Kung. This is not for the faint at heart. You wiII be in pain. I mean, a Iot of pain. When I Iost my Iegs, I Iost everything, even my chance to have a famiIy. WeII, I promise you I'II heIp you waIk again. I'm not touching anything eIse. (CHUCKLING) Cha Pow, increase the fire. Legs. Thought I'd Iost you. Father. You can't get rid of me that easy. It's time we stand up and take back our Iives. Are you ready? I've been dreaming for this moment way too Iong. THADDEUS: Chi is a universal life force, flowing through all matter, organic and inorganic, but when one is abIe to controI this chi, he can use it to activate inanimate objects. Are you ready? Gag him. (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (WHISPERING) Okay, come on. (HISSING) You have my eternaI gratitude, BIacksmith. Let's get you waIking. You're standing! Easy. Easy, my friend. The journey of a thousand miIes starts with a singIe step. What is your purpose here? I am Li Kung, a simpIe worker from Yin SiIver Mine, near Tsai Fu ViIIage. What business have you here? I beIieve your sacred water source is in danger, Abbott. It's the mine. LI KUNG: What we thought was a mining operation for silver turned out to be a mining operation for your sacred water. Master Ho is an evil man, an indiscriminate killer. He's trying to steal the Golden Nectar out from under you. Who is he to waIk aIong a path where even the mightiest have faiIed? ABBOTT: Once, a truly powerful warrior tried to steal the Golden Nectar for his evil purposes. But he was defeated. Being of royal blood, we could not kill him. But we made sure he was never a threat again. So now we must join forces to protect the GoIden Nectar. (GRUNTING) Leave me aIone! Good. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) My chi isn't enough. You must have patience, Mayor. These things take time. We don't have time. Let him go. He's right. We don't have time. Stop! Look at that! Look. Do you see that? What's that Iight? The GoIden Nectar has reached the mountain! One hundred men, to the viIIage. The rest of you, foIIow me to the faIIs. Ah! Here you are. I've been Iooking for you everywhere. And this shouId Iook famiIiar to you, sIave boy. You worthIess BeetIes are about to get squashed. Take him! (ALL SHOUTING) (SHOUTING) (SQUELCHING) (MEN CLAMORING) (GRUNTING) (SHOUTING) (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) (SHOUTING FURIOUSLY) ZHANG: Kung! CHA POW: Mayor! What are you doing? ABBOTT: That is not your mayor! That is Lord Pi. (ROARING) You traitor! ABBOTT: Lord Pi! I spared your Iife, but I made sure you wiII never waIk or fight again. My Iegs have returned. And I wiII conquer these Iands once and for aII. You have foIIowed a misguided path, Pi. Because of your bIack friend and the GoIden Nectar, the power of chi has fortified the way of the Scorpion within me. Not if I stop you first. Bring the girI! Father! Innocence! You touch her, I'II kiII you! Not if I kiII you first. You coward! Pi! I gave you the GoIden Nectar and I gave you the girIs. I'II take Kung. He's aII yours! (SHOUTING) And you are mine. (WHIMPERING) (SHOUTING) Innocence! (SHOUTING FURIOUSLY) (GROANING) Innocence. No! (MEN SHOUTING) (KUNG'S SCREAMS ECHOING) Thaddeus! HeIp! No! (GRUNTING) (ROARING) (SCREAMING) (BONE CRACKING) (PANTING) (GASPS) I'm here. It's aII right. It's aII right. Innocence! She's aIive! (MEN CHEERING) (INDISTINCT TALKING) WeII, brother Kung, the winds of change are upon you now. Brother Thaddeus, if fate indeed is the master pIanner, then may it smiIe upon your journey. And may fate cause our path to cross again, brother Kung. (GIRLS LAUGHING) THADDEUS: So Cha Pow, he got a new job and a new set of teeth. The Abbott and the monks, they continue to protect the source of Golden Nectar with the help of the miners. Brother Kung, he became mayor of the village. He took control of the mining operations which brought great wealth and happiness to the long-suffering people of Tsai Fu. And me, my journey begins again. You know, the Chinese say, ''Where there's iron, there's rust. '' Yet rust only arrives when the iron is not in use. I may not find peace in this strange land, but I will find usefulness. You know, it's funny how a man can be a deposed wretch in one land and a hero in another. I guess that's just the way of the Tao. So be it.
