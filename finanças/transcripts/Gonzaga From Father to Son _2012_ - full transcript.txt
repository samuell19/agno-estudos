If the miracle did happen I return And my shadow Appeared in hinterland And people ask me to sing And at the hour I had been missing The booming voice If the miracle did happen I return Without could leave singing there about I take oath that I asked to God For saving me Of a miracle like this so beast, Tiny In this sky I don't feel envy of the brunet ones Dancing their coconuts And maracatus The consolation in this world Where I am "not" It is know that there in the Earth I am still "yes" That the baião is alive In his heart That the song of happy people Does not have order Ultimately If I am still King It because on Earth Everything and so real And the people sing The corner that I sung No matter the right and wrong The good and the evil You May still hear me Through my old recordings It is signal That the world will remain There is live from the myths, dreams and passions I'd like to know how was your childhood like. My childhood? Look, Luizinho, it's crazy that you should ask me that. My childhood was that of a poor boy. When a brat has the privilege of staying cIose to his father... he will feel more secure. If the old man is a good one, the brat will be good, too. Is there anything else you want to know, man? -You're a naughty one. -I'll bother you a lot longer yet. BASED ON A TRUE STORY I asked God up in his Heaven... "What's happening to us now?" Gonzaguinha? Gonzaguinha, you haven't answered my question. Do you plan on recording your father's hits? What's Luiz Gonzaga's influence on your career? It was a long show. I must rest now. GONZAGUINHA: AN EXPLOSlVE HIT Look, Gonzaga, the kid has already a penchant for music. The apple never falls... Stay away from that accordion! This boy will have an education! I want to see a professional ring on one of Januario's grandson's hands! Gonzaguinha, may I come in? There's someone here wishing to see you. Helena... You're the last person I thought I'd see here today. I came 'cause I'm grasping at straws. Your father... He needs you badly. Sorry, I can't. If I may, and may I sing in tune Since I was a kid in Exu, my backlands... I sang like a carefree cicada That's why, now-a-days, I'm still the King of Baião! I'm thankful to the Brazilian people. North, Center, the whole South where Baião rules supreme! Have I deserved my king's crown? I've always honored it, it was my duty. It's been many years since I've last seen my father. WELCOME TO EXU LUIZ GONZAGA LAND'S Truth be told, we've never got along. My accordion, my voice, my Baião... This leather hat and vest, too... I'll gather it all together, give away to a Museum, It's time to say goodbye, Luiz, King of Baião! Who was my father? Who was Luiz Gonzaga? EXU , 1981 BAIÃO KlNG HOUSE Luizinho? Where's my father, Priscila? If he knew you were coming, he told us nothing about it. He probably forgot... as usual. Juazeiro tree, you don't remember Where our love has come to be... Juazeiro tree, under your canopy We talked, my girl and me... Oh, Juazeiro tree, How painful it is to me... Hey, bro! Haven't I asked you, please, turn off the damn radio? Haven't you got any manners, kid? Just 'cause you came from a big city... you think you can treat people like dirt? Oh, Mr Camilo, don't pay him any heed. That brat is my kid. I could never have guessed! Well, here it is. Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento Jr. Son of Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento... and Odaleah Guedes dos Santos. It's written here. It's written right here! Take a look at this contract. It's a gig I got you. Enough of performing in any dance hall around. Take a seat. Come on, sit down! For your information, I might be away from Southern hit parades... but here, in the Northeast... the common folk love me. I get gigs any time I want. Bullshit! You know Helena sought me out, don't you? You're broke, aren't you? She begged me for help. Do we lack for anything here? Do you think we lack for anything here? Here, Priscila! At first sight, no-one would say you've graduated college! It's hair and beard to no end! But you've graduated college! -You've graduated business college! -Sign it, damn it! Come on! I don't know what Helena was thinking when she sought you out. You don't know me. -Have you given me the honor? -Show me some respect, you brat! Show me some respect! Are you never gonna grow up? Brat! I don't know what I'm doing here. -Where do you think you're going? -I'm leaving. Take me to that corner over there. Stop over there, at that jua tree. Whose house is this? Colonel Raimundo's. Gimme your hand! Gimme your hand. -Can you feel it? -Yep. So what? Can I go now? Didn't you say you wanna get to know me? You are the L. Who's the N? Nazinha... Look here. Our initials... No, Luiz... Not here, Luiz... Luiz... Not here. I said, not here! -What are you afraid of? -You know very well. After you're married to me... we won't have to hide anymore. And I'll tell your father. I'd rather you didn't. Why? After all the things he said about you... What did he say about me? That you haven't got a place to lay your head down... Is that all? Tell me. That you are a penniless mulatto oaf... You haven't got a penny to your name. LuIa! Tell your dad to stop playing that damn accordion! It's interfering with our prayers! -Your blessing, father. -May God make you a man, son. Mom complained that your accordion is interfering with her prayers. Nonsense, kid. Help me out here. Tomorrow, I have two instruments to deliver. Come! I fixed that one this afternoon. Come on. What should I play? Play that coco beat your mother likes... -But play it softly. -All right. Follow me, come on! Hit it, Luiz! The balI was set to happen, everything was fine. The accordion player recanted on his word. Oh, man, I can't make it. I have a lot of work here. I can't make it. It's such a big party. The man told me to offer you money. That's something he's never really done before. Gee... Are you sure, Miguel? But don't you know I don't like playing at Colonel Raimundo's? This is an emergency, man! An emergency! No deal. What about Luiz? He's such a nice player... "Nice player"? That isn't much. That's not enough to shake up a big ball. -Let me go, father. -Let him, man. Please... Let's talk to Santana. Santana rules these things here. Luiz? Is he big enough to play in a dance? You don't know, ma'am... I saw him play an Argentine tango! Isn't that right, Luiz? This kid must help me tend the soil. I don't want a player for a son. There's no helping it, Santana. The apple never falls far... Are they paying him? Think about a good sum. A good sum. Really good. I mean it. Luiz, what's wrong with you? Are you nervous? Who brought that brat here? Play, kid! Play! Cheers, my friend. Cheers. The people danced tiII daybreak... The colonel's party was the talk of the viIIage. Come on, Lula! The sun is up! I was so proud... Look at that! You smell sweeter than the barber's son. -Gee, leave me be, mom... -Don't get me all worked up! Come! Get some sense in your head. You heard me? Good afternoon... Pour me some, kid. What about your brother? Severino! Yes, my colonel? Walk Nazinha back home. -Yes, sir. -It's time to go home. Gee, daddy... I've just arrived. It's late for you. Come on! Stop arguing and do as I say! You please, get some sense. Don't mess up! This girl is not for the likes of you. Do you hear me, Lula? Another one. Look at that! They say Lampião's gang is near here. This is a man's man! To Lampião! Have a care, kid. Lampião is a dangerous thug. Pour me one more. He is dangerous to the landowner colonels. I wish Lampião'd make them all run away. Are you blind? Colonel? Do you know me, by any chance? But of course. So, you know about my feelings for your daughter, Nazinha. Only too well... Is it true you've been dissing me out? Saying I'm a shitty little accordion player? What else, Luiz? You said I haven't got a place to rest my bones. Anything else, Luiz? That I'm no good to marry your daughter, Nazinha. And you believe every silly thing these folk come up with? You, Luiz? Son of Januário? A deeply respected man around this land... This is nonsense. He's a man's man! Marry him right away, my girl! I swallowed it all dry, quiet, covered in manioc meal. I didn't kill him on the spot 'cause he's Januário's boy. He'd better vanish from Exu. If I see him again, I'll kill him. Well done! Armed... Drunk! And wild as the Devil's stallion! -I did nothing wrong, mom! -Didn't you? Now I'll see if you're really a man's man. -Come here, you stupid brat! -Mother, please! What have you done?! Show me how brave you are! Show me! Show me how brave you are! Look at yourself in the mirror, son. She's rich... She's white... And educated. You're poor, Lula. You can barely read. It's about time you became a man. What now, Luiz? What do we do now? I don't want to bury a son of mine. Where are you going, Luiz? Priscila, tell mom I'm going for a gig at Crato's Fair. I never been on a big city. I sleeped on street. Than I came to arm. There were so many revolutions blowing up... They needed strong boys like me. You quit being an accordion player to enlist. That's nice. I was so poor, the Army, for me, was a privilege. We had uniforms, a place to sleep, and good chow. 1 YEAR LATE Pernambuco! Hey, Pernambuco! Your father's here. What are you talking about? There's a man outside. He says he must talk to his son. Then, he said your name. -Your blessing, my father. -May God make you happy, my son. So, this is the Crato's Fair where you're supposed to play... It's been over a year. What a hard thing to do... You disappeared just like that, without a single word. Your mother has lost her taste for life. She hardly eats, hardly sleeps. Tell mom the pain from that beating's gone. I've understood I was wrong. I could have triggered a tragedy, and destroyed everybody's lives. Is this a man's life? To go about killing folk? You can rest assured. I'll never kill anyone. I promise you that. Are you coming back home? Not yet. I've faith I'll become a man worthy of marrying Nazinha. Colonel Raimundo will have to respect me. Give this money to mom. Tell her not to cry. You've seen me fat and joyful. Tell her, from now on, I'll be sure to send her 30000 réis every month. God bless you. The Army is calling Here I am, colonel! Chow time! Chow time! Chow time! Chow time! Recruit, it's sounding chow time! -Line up! -Three, four! -Men in arms! -Three, four! It smells of shit in here! -Is it you, man? -Not me! Jesus, Pernambuco! Are you siding with the enemy? The stink will fell the troops! Troops, attention! Where's your other boot, trooper? -Are you deaf, trooper? -No, sir! Tell me what happened! My boot flew off the train's window, sir! What?! My boot flew off the train's window, sir! Quiet! What's a soldier without proper gear good for? I ended up in clink, not in battle. I've been to all revolutions. I've never fired a single bullet! Just as I promised my father. I wanted to return to Exu as an educated... evolved... and very rich man. Isn't that the way it should be? What do I know? You were the one to come here, so full of it... rubbing your wealth in my face, weren't you? I meant to help, that's all. But there's no helping you. I've always took care of myself. I was never fond of anyone butting into my life. How odd! I feel just the same. At least, we can agree on that much. Now, let's go. I'm hungry as hell. -The Army gave me perseverance. -It repressed the people's freedom. Very well... Tell me, cookie monster, have you ever starved? You took care that would never happen, sir. I've been deployed everywhere. I became the troop's trumpeter. I used to pIay such a weeping trumpet... They nicknamed me "Steelbeak". I spent almost ten years of my life in barracks. Enough, Steelbeak! Everybody's up already! When I was discharged, I went to Rio de Janeiro. I was about to make my destiny. Hey! This spot's owned, man. -Can you play that thing? -Yep. So, play me a tango. Tomorrow, I'll teach you fado. I'll introduce you to my wife, Dinah. Do you know a place I can sleep? You can crash with us for a while. No problem. Get a job, louts! I'm working! I don't smoke. You can have them, Xavier. I thought I'd go back a rich man to my Pernambuco. This partnership's no good. Good evening, my friends! I am Ary Barroso, and this is "Rookie Stars"! To those reaching 5 stars, Gillette offers a Cr$ 150 prize! Let's welcome the first contender! Next... -Poor guy. -Are you rich yet, redneck? -This isn't enough for a meal. -No wonder! What a boring fado. -Are you from Paraíba? -I'm from Exu, Pernambuco backland. Play us something from up North, and I'll pay for your lunch. We're all from Crato! I crave for some dance tunes. It's been a while since I've played anything from up there. I don't even remember anymore. Have you forgotten about your homeland, accordion player? Have you unlearned your instrument? Oh, my goodness! This lad is a patron already! Tell us, this time, is it going to be a fado or a waltz? Here comes that guy again, the one who plays that awful fado. He has already set up his saucer. Neither a fado, nor a waltz. Today, I'll play something from up North. Something? And what's this something called? Turn's shake. Now you're cooking! You're a true Pernambuco fellow! Here! A dish! Bring me a dish! This is so good! Ary could do nothing about it! I got Five stars! Five! The top spot! people went crazy! It was a different beat, from the Northeast. Down South, nobody's ever heard it. It's too much History. When I realized... time had passed me by. What about my mother? Your mother? Your mother was different. She was ahead of her time. She looks impossible for me... Wait a sec. Wait a sec, I'll be right back. What the hell are you doing with that? One, two, three, test... Sound... Are you interested now? You were talking about my mother. I made some money when I started playing music from the Northeast. Not much. I rented a shack, a suit... I pretended I was rich... and I went after Leah! Please, I want five dances. I'm sorry, but it's my turn. It's my turn! My turn, kid! I like your insolence. The others can wait. Tonight, I'll punch up your whole dancing card. -Have you been playing long? -I've learned from my father. When I was little, he took me with him to the dances. Teach me one of his tunes. Then, you can play it, and I'll sing it. Can you sing? When the whistle from the cloth factory Pierces my ears, I think about you... I dance for a living, but I like singing much better. Do you know what I wish? I wish you could be mine alone. This is a humble abode, but it's gonna get better soon. Would you move in with me, Leah? -What year was that? -It was in the early '40s. You used to fight a lot, didn't you? I was stupid... uneducated... I was unprepared to have a lover from the big city. I miss you sorely already. Where are you going, all dressed up like some lordship? I'll try my luck. Can I go? No, you stay home. Clean everything up. Then, you bathe and wait for me, beautiful and perfumed. I'm going to the Dancing tonight. -Why keep doing that, Leah? -That is my job. -I've told you I'll support you. -I don't want you to! You know I like going out, I like the night life! I like singing! Since you like singing and dancing so bad... you sing and dance for me alone. Stop! Stop it! I'm pregnant. Come here. Come... Come here... -How much is that one? -That one is Cr$ 100. Don't be silly, Luiz. We can't afford that. Just a sec. What did you do back then? I played gigs as an accordionist. I played almost every record label! I couldn't sing, though. Thank you very much. Have you considered being part of our radio station's cast? You've got a deal! Leah! Leah! Come here, Leah! Leah? Leah? -Step away from my woman! -I'm working, Luiz! -You'll go home now, I say! -Let me go! I'm telling you to release me. Let me go! You rub yourself against anyone and you say the kid is my son?! The son is mine. He's mine. May I come in? What are you doing here? Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento Junior. So, he'll be lucky in his life. I gave you 20000 reis to pay up 3300... -You have to return me -16700! -17700! -16700! I gave you 20000 reis to pay up 3300... -You have to return me -16700! I have a certificate! From an Academy! I know Geography! I can even subtract! I gave you 20 bucks to pay 3.300 17.700, you have to return me... -17.700! -16.700! Due to an unforeseen problem, our show must be cut short. In a bit, we'll return with a new artist. You have been hired as an accordion player. What do you think you are? Orlando Silva? You have an awful voice. -But the audience liked it! -No arguments, please. You are fired! 17.700! Is that your idea of lyrics? I need a regional writer! We can finish the verses in two minutes flat! Let's do it some other time. I'm too hungry. I'm off to lunch! Please, help me, Dr. Humberto! I've just become a father. I need to provide for my family! I even have a verse started. Listen up, please! Some other time, Mr. Luiz! I'm off to lunch! At the foot of the hill I left my heart behind At the foot of the hill I left my heart behind At the foot of the hill I left my heart behind -Is that all? -That's where you come in. Oh, how I miss it! I'm going back to my backland! At the field, I worked day and night But my ranch had Everything I wanted We used to dance Every Thursday night Accordions aplenty Playing xotes all night long! Xote is nice... to dance! We stick to the chick Never let go! A step to the right, A step to the left While the bellow's playing, moaning Crying, groaning non-stop Closer... closer... All right... What a long, long road What an unforgiving distance... Oh, had I wings Today, I'd see my Anna... Leah? Tuberculosis!. It is consumption. I'll have to stay away from you. I'll have to stay away from Luizinho. You'll be fine, Leah. You'll heal. Gonzaga, the kid was famished! When Leah's healthy again, we'll pick him up together. I have to go on tour, Dinah. I signed a contract. I can't put my life on hold. I ain't in any hurry. You go, and don't worry about him. I'll show you, good folk, right now How you should dance the Baião Whoever wishes to learn it should pay attention to me! Sweet baby, come closer closer to my heart -That's him, Santana! -That's really him! Son of a gun! The audience is packed to the rafters! And there's a huge crowd waiting outside. The people can't have enough of you, Gonzaga! I'll sing to the people! Are you nuts, Gonzaga? Sing to the people? What about the ticket holders? Are you insane? Gonzaga? We're sold out! Wow, Jacques! Bring everything over! Today, I'll play for the people! SHOW ON TOP OF CINE PAX'S MARQUEE - 1947 If we remember For remembering sake The love we've had and lost This longing feels good The guy understands He's happy, he just doesn't know it He hasn't suffered! But if we can't stop dreaming Of someone we haven't seen in a while This longing feels like a pain And I can say that again I'm always hurting and wild! Oh, how I wish I'd go back To my sweetheart's soft arms Such longing hurts me so bad It's sour, it's bitter, and harms But no-one can say that I've been seen weeping and gloom Longing, my only solace's a tune! Longing, my only solace's a tune! For you. Now, I'm the King of Baião, Leah. And you are my queen. Baby... Baby, you'd better rest. What about Luizinho. He's fine. He's all grown up. Have you ever taken him to one of your shows? Leah...? Promise me something. Promise me you'll take care of my son. You won't let him lack for anything. Promise me. I need you cared for Luizinho for a while longer. Don't worry, Gonzaga. Dinah will be thankful. For expenses. Gonzaga, come on, we don't need much. You've given us more than enough. Take it, Xavier. I insist. The boy mustn't lack for anything. You've never lacked for anything. Just you. How long will you rub it in, boy? It was a very difficult time for me. When she died, I Iost my way. I missed my homeland... my family... my backlands... The Northeastern herdsman Dies without a penny to his name. His name will be forgotten in these God-forsaken backlands Never again... will your tune Be heard, oh my brother Is anybody home? Is anybody home? Praised be Our Lord, Jesus Christ! Forever and ever, amen! Mr. Januário, I've just arrived from Rio de Janeiro. I have a message from a son of your loins! I've even brought something to place in your hand. Who are you, sir? -Don't you recognize me? -No... You little...! How dare you come home this late?! Santana! Lula's home! Santana! Gonzaga's home! I hollered "Praise the Lord!" And the kids hollered back! Lots and lots of kids! I had brothers I'd never met! And nobody slept a wink. Early morning, the house was packed full of folk! So, I said, "Now, I'm showing off!" "I'll sing to them folk!" I unsheathed the hurdy-gurdy and floored it! When I thought I was owning it... -Luiz! -Raimundo Jacob! He shouted from amongst the good folk, "Luiz!" "Show Januário some RESPECT, you brat!" When I returned to my homeland I mocked Januário with my fancy sliver bellow! It had 120 bass keys alone, black keys, black soft leather But before I could show off When I stepped on the floor All the people told me off From Itaboca to Rancharia, From Salgueiro to Bodocó It's Januário and nothing more! "Luiz, show respect to Januário! Luiz, show respect to Januário!" "You may be famous, but your Ol' Man's righteous!" "Nobody beats him! Luiz! Luiz!" "Respect your father's eight bass keys instrument!" What about Nazinha, mom? What happened to her? She married some rich man. She moved to a place called... Mato Grosso. Is she still pretty? She's just the same. What about the little boy, my grandson? Why didn't you bring him here? Next time, the kid will come with me. If you want me to, leave him here, and I'll raise him. When I raise my voice, Please, understand me... Word by word, here's someone... Giving himself fully With my heart in my sleeve... I bleed... Have you given up? Won't you interview me no more? Where's that gadget? I thought you were all talked out. Don't take me wrong. When your mother died, my life turned upside down. I felt an awful emptiness in my heart. When a man loses the love of his Iife... he thinks of everything he's left behind. Someday, I'll come back for you. Your blessing, mother. God bless you, my son. I left. But, this time, I had the backlands in my heart. When I saw the Iand was burning Like a fire at St John's Night I asked the Lord up In Heaven above So much destruction, My Lord, oh, why? I asked the Lord up In Heaven above So much destruction, My God, oh, why? What a bonfire, what a furnace Not a stalk from any crop For lack of water I lost my livestock My faithful stallion I lost to drought Would you give me an autograph, sir? Come on in. -What's your name? -Helena. I'd like to tell you, where I come from... every letter merits an answer. Your letter must be here. You see? I have no time to read, let alone answer these letters. -Helena... what's your last name? -Cavalcanti. Would you work for me? Taking care of this mess? I'll pay you Cr$ 400 a month. Come to my arms, my dark beauty My dark beauty, dance with me I want to see you move I want to see you sway I want to see you shake to the tune of the accordion till the sun comes up. Have you seen O Cruzeiro Magazine? How can the media be so mean to me? You're getting a reputation as a lady killer. How about that? Are you jealous? I have something to teach you, Luizinho. Women must be like stumbles on your way. They kick the guy up ahead. That's what Helena was good for, wasn't it? Helena has always been very good to me. I can't say the same. If not for her, I could be a pauper today. Long live the bride and groom! -Go on, Luizinho. -No... no... You go there, yes, sir. Smile! It is a palace! This house must be hell to clean up, right? It is too beautiful! Come, Luizinho. Let's see your room. This is beautiful! Come on in, folks! Come on in. This is your house, now! Where are you going? Why? I'm going for a gig. But we got married yesterday, Gonzaga. This is a quick gig. I'll be right back. -How long? -A month. A month! Are you insane? Your whole family's living here. That's the whole point. If the family's bigger, the earnings must grow bigger too. What about Luizinho? I barely know the kid. He's got you, your mother, and mine. Are you saying three women can't care for a boy? This is beautiful! Luiz Gonzaga on Tour! Let's go, my friend. Let's rip this country apart! Let's go! I've always liked outdoor shows better. The circus... The town's square... For those who can't afford tickets. My thing is singing to the common folk! Hello, my Pernambuco! Oh, what a fine looking brunette! What a beautiful dark-haired one! Come to my arms, my dark beauty My dark beauty, dance with me I want to see you move I want to see you sway You left me all alone in that house with your family. And you disappeared. I barely knew Helena. You have to respect me! You can't boss me around! You ain't my mother! This is my fate! Come on! Go! Go ahead! I said go ahead! First, you're gonna think about what you've done! You ain't my mother! Let me out of here! Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out! The players got plastered last night. I couldn't wake them up. I don't want any more drunks playing with me. Fire them both. Gonzaga, we have a bunch of set up gigs, man! Do as I say! What about tonight's gig? How can we make it without players? Can you play on your own? Hey, you. Come over here. What are you afraid of, man? Come here! I'm calling you. Come here! Hey, man! Catch that guy! Catch that guy! Hey, Russo! Come over here, lad! Tell me... Do you drink? For crying out loud, Gonzaga! What a stink! What have you got? A shoeshine and a dwarf! At least, they don't drink. They neither drink, nor can they play. -Stop over there. -Stop where? At the river bank. Stop! Step out, the two of you. Hurry up, lads! Not you, Rat! You go to town and promote tonight's show. Come back late afternoon and pick me up. You have to strip, too! Take your clothes off! Let's go! Everybody in the water! Hello, Brazilian people! Tonight, at the City Theater, the King of Baião, Luiz Gonzaga! It's a sensation! No, that's wrong. You almost got it. Come with me. You got it! When the mud turned to stone And the cactus dried up When the eared dove, so thirsty Flapped wings and flew away That's when I left my homeland Carrying with me all my pain Today, I send you a hug, my bonnie! Paraíba, you're strong Stronger than any man can be! Paraíba, you're strong Stronger than any man can be! Cost of Living... and Minimum Wage! Strong woman! Step away, damn you! Yes, sir! Four months, and you've barely phoned home! I brought the kid to live here. You shouldn't have sent him away. You don't know him, what a handful he is. He is my son! Your son? You barely know that kid, Gonzaga! I get home, I can't find either my father or my son. You don't care about anybody! Your father likes living in Exu. Let him be! Your mother fell ill, Gonzaga. Did you know that? Of course you didn't. You enjoy living on the road, flirting with those hoochies! Enough, Helena! Enough. I'm not ashamed of that. I'll adopt a girl, Gonzaga. At least that, you'll have to give me. My mother was right. Who's sure Luizinho's your kid if you can't give me one of my own? That uncertainty... lt always hurt you, right? You never saw my side. I don't want you hanging out with lowlifes! You know full well your father hates tardiness. That house's full of motherfuc... Watch your language! Whether you like it or not, Gonzaga's your father. Put this shirt on, and let's go. Tell me truthfully! Have you ever seen a prettier girl? God bless, Lula! The little bastard's here. What are you talking about, Mrs. Marieta? It's grits. Your father loves it. Hey, nutjob! What are you playing? I'm playing with myself. Come here, brat! Give this to Jellyfish. Be careful with that shit! Will do. Very nice! So young and already a crook. Let me go! I didn't do nothing! Really? What's this? Who's your father? Tell me, brat! Who's your father? Luiz Gonzaga. The King of Baião? -That's the one. -You little liar! -Who's your father? -Luiz Gonzaga. Are you shitting me, kid? Who's your father? Luiz Gonzaga! Okay, you're coming with me. If I find him again in the same situation... I'll have to take him to Children's Services. You were impossible back then. You disrespected everybody with no good reason. Stop right there! What do you mean, with no good reason? You can make up your fibs to anybody but me! I ain't making up no fibs! If I didn't put an end to it... I don't know what would've happened to you! Step out! -I don't want to stay here. -Don't be silly. This is Rio's best school. From here, you'll go on to graduate from college! Let's go! Good morning... Let's go. You got rid of me at your best convenience! As usual! I gave you the best education money could buy! Education! I spent ten years in that boarding school! It is consumption. THE NORTHEAST ECHOES LUIZ GONZAGA'S VOICE I came for you, son. Eat something, Luizinho. It's important. Come on, sweetie. If I could, I'd bring you home. But I have Rosinha, Helena, Marieta. -This disease catches. -I'm home. When you get better, you can come live with me. Rosinha can ride better than I do. This girl is a real fast learner! It's been tough, Gonzaga. Another gig canceled on us. I talked to the record label guys about the new record. They said they'll try. Gonzaga, you can't see people like new stuff. You don't know jack, Helena In the backlands, there's plenty of folk to listen to me. I want to see it translated into money. I can't make ends meet! How can we pay more than we earn? Ma'am? Where can I set this box? I have no idea! Our furniture doesn't fit in this flop! I used to believe in life In the sheer happiness of being In the things of the heart Hands full with plenty to do I used to sit high up on the hill An urchin watching the town Smelling the tarmac He climbed down 'cause he needed to Hey, Dinah... Your kid climbed down São Carlos hill slum... He caught a dream and left... Mom, as you've said yourself... whether I like it or not, Luiz Gonzaga is my father. I must find out who he is. I must find out who I am. I kiss from your brat. A never-ending fire Tell Dinah I'll be back Her kid hasn't run away! All he wished was to learn what gives... Your father isn't home. But he told me you'd come. Come in. It's over there, at the end of the hallway. -I know it isn't much, but... -It's all right, Helena. I don't mean to be a burden. Let's crash here, Gonzaga. There's a lot of road still to cover till Rio. Let me drive, then. I want to get home early. Maybe due to ignorance Or just sheer hard evil blackbird had his eyes slit So he'd sing all the sweeter blackbird had his eyes slit So he'd sing all the... Come here, kid. Beautiful tune. Do you think the young 'uns will like it? Yep. They'll like it. This kid doesn't get along with me. Why insist? He spends his days in that room, and you think he'll graduate! I promised he could live with me when he got better. He's my son, Helena. Well, find the money to feed another mouth! My hair turns sliver every day But the accordion is still in tune... In order... to restore to this troubled nation... the government's authority! And say "Everything's better now" You should display a happy face And say "Everything's better now" You must realize you don't have a penny And say you ain't worried... You deserve it! You deserve it! Everything's All right! Everything's fine! Beer, samba, and tomorrow, man... It will be Carnaval time! You and your ideas! Now, you write this communist music! Do you mean to end up in jail, kinky hair? One writes as one believes. Better than you, bootlicker to the military! The military put food on our table! They pay for your college, something I do with sacrifice! I've never asked you for anything. It's your money. You decide what to do with it. Show me some respect! Respect! I gave you my name! My name, you got it? I want to see you graduate! With a professional ring! A professional ring! I've graduated without your money. I made it without your support. That day, I made up my mind I'd never count on you again. I don't know what I'm doing here. Oh, I got it! You're fucking broke! Watch your language! You're broke in pieces! -I'm your father! -No, you're not! My father is Henrique Xavier. You're nothing but a picture! You're a poster, a banner! The King of Baião! You can bullshit them, bro! A man beloved by the people, who couldn't love his own son! What kind of a king's that? Tell me what king is that?! You abandoned me. The one thing you did for me all your life was open your wallet! Why don't you open it now? That's the way you raised me! Open it now! -Open your damn wallet! -Enough! You have no right to humiliate me so. Go away, leave this house. Go away. When I raise my voice, Please, understand me... Word by word, here's someone... Giving himself fully With my heart in my sleeve... I bleed... What do you want? Are you playing the lamp post? If there's one person in the whole world who loves you, it's that kid. All he wanted... was to be your friend, Gonzaga. Check the sparkle in my eyes And the trembling in my hands My sweaty body overflows in guts and feeling! If I cry and the sun Moist my smile... Don't fret, just sing! Your song is my strength to sing! Priscila? Where's my father? It was still dark when he left. I'm worried about him. Go away! I've kept this for you. My dream... A professional ring... Here... It makes no difference anymore. Can you forgive me? I've wronged you greatly, too. I'm very proud of you, of your music. You're a hit. It doesn't matter whether your blood runs in my veins... You're my son. I'm a crooked father... but I'm still a loving father. You're my father, my old man. My old man... You're my father. And my mother is Odaleah Santos. As it says in my ID card. I'll say something quickly, and I'll objectively ask someone... who has given... and still gives 40 years of his life for his work... to a voice who represents a forgotten portion of Brazil... I'd like you to sing with him... My father... Luiz Gonzaga! THE TRAVELER'S LIFE TOUR - 1981 FATHER AND SON ON STAGE FOR THE FIRST TlME TOGETHER My father, Luiz Gonzaga. This is a road song.
