Television. The small screen. The idiot box. Boy, do we love watching the telly, especially when it doesn't quite go to plan. Disgraceful! You're disgraceful! Now this is getting a bit toe-curling. I think the great thing about live TV is spelt backwards it's "evil". Oof! Ah! Ooh! Already... Since the first broadcasts, cameras have captured some of the most dangerous... It was dreadful. ...ridiculous... LAUGHING: Look at the cat! He's got a face like a slapped backside. ...bizarre... It's a very big pig, by the way. ...awkward... Ouch! There's a lamppost! Bong! ..."What the flip?"... It's like a dance. ...and explosive moments... I do star on the BBC safety video. ...with first-hand accounts from those on both sides of the camera. The awkwardness was priceless. Coming up, a live TV debate gets out of hand for Anna Soubry... Are you going to hit me? Oi, boys! I wouldn't mess with her. ...Judge Rinder is dogged by two pooches who go horribly wrong on his show... Animals tend to do what animals want to do. ...and there are alarm bells for Krishnan Guru-Murthy, quite literally, on Channel 4 News. FIRE ALARM BLARING We do have some problems here at ITN this lunchtime. Wrap this up NOW! I do struggle with lids and what have you... So, sit back, strap yourself in, and brace yourself for When Television Goes Horribly Wrong. It starts right now! Robert Rinder - AKA Judge Rinder - has been presiding over domestic disputes on ITV since 2014. Did you, Gareth, describe what Ross would have to do during the course of the act? No. Judge Orinda is the UK's answer to Judge Judy in America. He's always sort of the mediator in these arguments. You got to the event. What did you discover Gareth wanted you to wear? He is the voice of the nation for little matters. We've got some nice footwear, a lovely little mini skirt, antlers, and a tie. At least there were antlers, Ross. Getting people to come and air their dirty laundry and actually sort out some sometimes really pathetic situations. The sort of squabbles that, generally, you'd probably fall out with somebody and then never speak to them again. In reality, he is dealing with the most petty, littlest type of things. But it makes good television and we like watching it. The more trivial it gets, the better. In 2016, the judge had an interesting case brought before him. They met each other. They were sniffing around. And having got on, you, Anne, came up with a rather interesting idea. What was the interesting idea? To have them get married. It's two friends whose dogs were going to get married. Sandra and Anne are serious about getting these dogs married.. The doggie wedding was to raise money for charity. But when it was cancelled, Anne wanted damages for loss of opportunity. I think this was probably one of the most random that he's had. Claiming loss of opportunity is a... ...LOL. Seriously, could you just not sit around the pub and sort this out in about five minutes? How much were you planning to spend on this event? I was trying to get sponsors, people involved. Hopefully, to get the donation of the marquee. JUDGE RINDER LAUGHS I've just seen the dog. STILL LAUGHING Sorry. Now, Anne and Sandra have brought the dogs with them. Oh, look at them. They look so cute. Soon as he saw them - gone. When I saw it from afar, at first I thought it looked like toilet roll wrapped around the dog. This way. Hi, Diva. Oh, brilliant. Thank you. You cannot NOT laugh at a dog in a wedding dress. Max, no... No! Max, no, no! LAUGHTER CONTINUES The man dog couldn't wait to, er, prove his love. And they start sniffing each other and getting on with the business. Animals tend to do what animals want to do. You're not married yet. Come on. He's not just laughing. He's weeping. You've got two dogs giving it on your court floor - your place where you tell people what's right and what's wrong. HE SOBS WITH LAUGHTER He's like, wow, OK... I can't. You're not married... You're not married yet! It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase "clogging". One of the most funniest thing I think I've ever seen on TV. It may be TV, but he was still expected to oversee proceedings in a cool, calm and collected manner. This was very un-judge-like. Judge Rinder's quite professional, and I've never really seen him lose it like that. It's so unlike him because he's such a great TV character. He can composed himself. He knows what to say and how. The judge's slip up hit social media and people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Judge Rinder continues to preside over civil cases... I've just seen the dog. ...but will forever be remembered for losing his composure so spectacularly. DOG BARKS Current affairs programmes and live TV debates are an opportunity for experts and audience members to discuss the burning issues of the day. No, you can't... Recently... When the subject matter is contentious, tempers sometimes do flare. SHE SPEAKS SPANISH There's nothin more that we love than a good old argument. These debate shows, they get a bit heated. Regional news programme Central Weekend Live was one such show that ran from 1986 to 2001. I hosted Central Weekend a couple of times. You'd tee up a debate, and then you'd get both sides. Welcome back. For the next 20 minutes, we are going to be talking about why creatures like this could end up as this... ...a arguably magnificent fur coat. In 1988, Anna Soubry was hosting the show. You've got Anna Soubry, a very young Anna Soubry, Journalist and barrister and then MP. Here tonight in the studio, we have 20 such groups opposed to the fur trade. You've got a really emotive subject. You are never going to find a middle ground in something like a fur debate. There is no substitute for a fur. An artificial fur will look terrible within a couple of months, where a natural fur will look beautiful for years. Fur traders arguing with animal rights activists. You've got two mannequins standing behind the panel, both wearing fur coats. If you went and you saw animals in traps, struggling, gnawing their legs off, you'd have a very different feeling about that fur. What you're doing... WOMAN TRIES TO INTERRUPT ...is you are draping yourself in a corpse. One moment. It was quite a tense studio, you could tell. The fur trade in this country, it's on its way out. Then it starts to kick off. Now, just a minute, just a minute. If everybody shouts at each other, we get nowhere. Wait. And then everyone starts talking over everybody else. And there's Anna. She's not having any of it. Let me ask... Let me... Just a minute... No. Anna Soubry was very good at trying to say, "Listen, can we just take the temperature down?" We've had invasions by these hooligans. No yoghurt. They barged into our shop, broken my son's nose. Why don't you be quiet, monkey-face? And then there's that one guy in the audience. He's quite portly. He just looks quite ordinary. And you sort of think has he come in to the right debate? Should he even be in here? He's probably just come out for a paper and ended up in't studio. Now, listen... You're out on bail, aren't you? Now, John... You are making... Isn't that true? You're out on bail for blackmail! As a host, you're trying to deal with fires on a number of different levels. So let him answer... Making a laughing stock of yourself! You are a criminal, and you're a blackmailer. So you've got the contributors doing one thing, then you've got the audience members also contributing and all trying to sound reasonable... Please, could you be quiet? Let him answer the point, otherwise we get nowhere. ...until such time as nobody sounds reasonable and they're just shouting at each other. I work as an administrator in the fur trade, and I'm not too involved with the farming and not too involved with the, erm, the trade side. No blood on your hands, you mean. Just listening to your allegations... Shut up, blackmailer. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Just listening to your allegations of cruelty... So then there's this poor woman who's trying to talk about the fact that she has worked in the fur trade, and she's trying to discuss it and nobody's listening to her. Sorry, excuse me - people at home watching this debate get no satisfaction... I hope they do. I would like them to know what sort of a person he is. You've made that point 50-odd times. We all know it. You know, he was talking over people, people talking over it. Just a minute, you two. Excuse me. If there's any trouble, you'll get thrown out. Let this lady speak. And that includes you. To be fair to Anna, she wanted to let the poor lady on the left have her say. Let this lady speak. AUDIENCE APPLAUDS And then, all of a sudden, off he goes. On your way. All right. Oi, oi, oi! Didn't see that coming. It's fisticuffs. The guy that kicks off, you just don't expect it. He just looks like anyone's uncle, doesn't he? Butter wouldn't melt. Uncle Ronnie. And he's not messing about, is he? He's straight over. And he starts ragging that man around. Gosh, this is just... It's chaos! Now, just a minute. I am not having this. Now come on... I'm going, I'm going, OK? Are you going to hit me? Are you going to hit me? Out! Hoping for a lively debate, the producers now had a live show that descended into chaos. You know, we all like to watch something where you just go, "Oof! Ah! Ooh! Ugh..." That's what we want, isn't it? But there's a point at which you suddenly think, "Hey, hold on! "What is going on?" For me, the key to a debate is not just having an argument, it's being able to listen. The problem with this is no-one's got time to listen to anybody else and everybody's just cutting each other up. And that's why this kicks off. Oi, oi, oi! Anna's reaction - even though she's prim and proper, she's not taking any messing. Now, come on... I'm going, I'm going, OK? Are you going to hit me? I just love the fact that Anna's having none of it. Oi, boys, I'm not having this on my show. Out! Phwoar! Don't mess with Anna Soubry! No. Sit down. You became the sort of rather posh Peggy Mitchell, didn't she? It wasn't, "Get out of my pub!" She was like, "Get out of my debate." Right. Out. I thought Anna dealt with that extraordinarily well. In that situation, you get a surge of adrenaline, so you're in your fight or flight mode and you're aware that you're in a TV studio, and you have to keep on talking. It's really sad that you cannot have a civilised debate. I mean, we look at those squabbling, screaming people, ranting and raving it - it was the perfect, I guess, apprenticeship before she went into the House of Commons, wasn't it, really? She would make a good bouncer, would Anna, because she gets straight in there. I wouldn't mess with her. Out! Still to come... Can you say that name? ...a TV shopping presenter is pranked live on air... Jack Mioff. Oh! Oh, come on. It's quite a good one. ...and Krishnan Guru-Murthy has some alarming news on Channel 4. We may actually have to evacuate the building. Now, in real life, you run! You don't want to be sitting in a burning building while everybody else has left it. Television can go horribly wrong any time. But when it's live, there are all manner of pitfalls, especially on channels that try to sell us stuff. Shopping channels. They're an interesting breed. They're big everywhere. They're big in the States, they're big here in the UK. To host a shopping channel requires special talents. I always salute all of those presenters. You're talking for so long but about such menial things. So it's like, talk for an hour about a Hoover. And don't forget - you've got an incredible market-beating price. If you are shopping elsewhere, you're not getting the extras. This is an exclusive bundle with us. People ask how difficult it is to talk ad nauseum on a TV shopping channel, just nonstop. They have to be brilliant because they have to flog stuff all day long. Well, let me tell you, I can talk the hind led... People often ask how long... It's a lot harder than you think. Elsewhere, you could go to Very - £280 there, you can go to E Cock... ...Shop. I don't know why I'm struggling with that so much! You just cringe. Did she? Oh, she did, cos she recognised that she said that wrong. I do apologise! They're very close. They're both, you know, it's... ...cock/cook. The amount of times that I or a co-presenter has done a slip of the tongue. You just have to try not to actually make a big deal of it. E-cook-shop. I can't believe you went there again. Is it me or is that quite a mouthful? CAMERA CREW LAUGH The chef loses the plot. She loses the plot. She doesn't mean it in the context, but then it's so funny. You can't... You can't write it. Being in control of your mouth is only half the battle. You've got to watch out for the viewers, too. We love the fact that this is raised. And they're trying to sell some spatulas. A spatula for £40. £40! Just had an e-mail. "Hi, guys. "Is the froacher dishwasher-safe?" Yes. We were interacting with the audience. We were extolling the virtues of products. And, of course, live e-mails were coming through. Oh, we've just had another e-mail. We've got... Oh... And I looked at the name. HE STUTTERS Can you say that name? Jack Mioff. Oh! Oh, come on. Working in radio as well, that is my biggest fear. When you're presenting a show like that and you ask people that are watching to give you feedback that you're going to read out live on air... ...you're asking for trouble. The 16-year-old version of me was probably doing that exact thing. And I was asking you for pronunciation. HE LAUGHS He reads this name and obviously thinks, I know exactly what that is, but you're not going to be sharp enough. It just looked like a real name. And I thought, how do you pronounce that? I walked straight into that! I mean, I'd have done the same thing, cos I'm so gullible. It's such a classic childish thing. Jack Mioff. Oh! It's quite a good one. I know a few Jacks, but I don't know any Mioffs. Not only that, you've got props to deal with. I've done them before, and it is live and you are demonstrating products. This is the square label. And they're chatting away and, "Ooh, isn't it lovely," and... I've done a lot of cutting already. CRASH THEY GIGGLE Bang! I'm not really selling this, am I? Because it's on the floor now, and it's broken. Now... it wouldn't have fallen out of the machine if Nancy hadn't have just given it a little nudge. She said that someone had knocked it. And she hadn't. That's just a lie. Then there's this little hand that comes up from nowhere. Erm, Tom, thank you. That was really, really kind. Magic Hands was down there in a flash. There needs to be a lot of love for floor managers. They call them Magic Hands because when things go wrong, Magic Hands always makes it better! Working with props, it's an accident waiting to happen. They've got these receptacles for holding beads. And you can put one on top of the other, and over and under, and screw it that way, screw it that way. I do struggle with lids and what have you... Balls everywhere. There's nothing really much you can do. Great comedy timing, right there. SHE SIGHS That... That was... Yeah. There you go. You can tell she's just pissed. She's just so angry that she did it, she doesn't even know what to say. ...lids and what have you... Completely defying the purpose of what it was supposed to actually do, was keep things organised. Who's going to pick up them little balls? It's not going to be her, is it? In the early 19805. And since 1998, one of the most recognisable faces on the daily bulletins has been Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Krishnan Guru-Murthy is an established presenter on Channel 4. He's the face of the news. In 2008, when the topic of eco towns and greener housing was being discussed, who better to interview the Housing Minister live on air than Krishnan? Joining me now from Westminster... ALARM BLARES ...is the Housing Minister, Caroline Flint. Is it true that people in these new towns could have to pay hundreds of pounds extra every year? When Krishnan is hosting the news, I always feel really safe. He's the consummate professional. He always stays calm. He's one of them that you can trust. And you always see him when you put on your TV. Well, if you look at communities around the country, parish councils, for example... He's interviewing Caroline Flint down the line, so she's not in the studio. ...it's certainly not a top down request from Government. Right, but it is possible. I should just... If I can break off for a second, you and our viewers at home maybe hearing a fire alarm... Oh, right... here in our building. Krishnan Guru-Murthy is mid flow when he hears the fire alarm. Now, in real life, you run! He's not panicking. He's there to a job. I apologise for that. And we're trying to find out whether it's real or not... Well, I'm not in your building so I won't worry about it. I hope we don't have to run out. She doesn't care. She's fine. She's all right, Jack. I hope we don't have to run out in the middle of this interview. The other... the other question, of course... He just continues interviewing Caroline. It's not Friday 10am, so it's not a test. We are supposed to hear a fire alarm and leave - for obvious reasons. Are we burning? ALARM CONTINUES Presumably the whole plan is going to be up for legal challenge. I think I'd have just said, "Sorry, the fire alarm's going. "I'm going to get out of here." Composure. He SMELLS of composure. He's like a captain on a sinking ship. ALARM CONTINUES And you're facing sort of criticism on all fronts at the moment. We've had a couple of developers pull out of a couple of projects... You can see him starting to look a bit agitated. You don't want to be sitting in a burning building while everybody else has left it. He's also trying to be quite polite cos he doesn't want to interrupt her cos she's kind of in mid flow. ALARM CONTINUES And I think the building... Caroline... the building industry recognised that we need greener housing as well. Eco towns... Caroline Flint... ..are one part of the solution to providing for that. Thank you. I'm really sorry to cut you off. That's all right. I apologise. But, unfortunately, the fire alarm means that, erm, we do have some problems here at ITN this lunchtime. Somebody says in Krishnan's ear, "You really need to go. This is a real alarm. Get out!" "Wrap this up NOW!" We're going to take a break now. We may or may not return after that because we may actually have to evacuate the building. This is a first, certainly in my career. It continued as long as he could. He handles it really, really well. When we do come back, if we come back, we will have the business news and more economic news for you. But hopefully see you... CHANNEL 4 NEWS THEME PLAYS I'm out of here! Better safe than sorry. Krishnan Guru-Murthy was, as I understand it, the last person out the building. As Krishnan left, the nation could only wonder whether he would make it back on air that night. He didn't return. Viewers were left news-less. The newsreader's sharp exit didn't go unnoticed by the national press. Instead of presenting the news, he ended up making the news. ALARM CONTINUES We will have the business news and more economic news for you. But hopefully see you... He's just unflappable. Shaken, not stirred. He should be the next James Bond. JAMES BOND STING PLAYS Local news stations are always looking for an exciting twist to grab their viewers' attention. So, in 2017, when Fox 5's Matt Johnson was presenting from a jetty at the San Diego Boat Show, what better way to open the news hour than with a man on a jet pack? I'm live here at the San Diego Yacht and Boat Show. Good morning, everybody. I'm hanging out with my friend John. The thing about being in the field is that you want to make it look sexy. And this is going to be a really exciting start to this particular segment. Someone sat down and thought, "You know what? I've got ingenious idea." "Let's get this guy in a jetpack "and we'll have him advertise this boat show." This is going to be epic. Matt's stood with jet pack guy. He's ready. This is the big moment. It's the grin on his face. He's going to nail this. All his friends are watching back home. The guy is going to finish it up, and we're just going to see this guy shoot off into the sky. The moment has come. You can feel it. The anticipation. Facebook's going to go wild. I am hanging out with my friend John. Fox 5 Morning News starts. Look over there. And it starts right now! Slap down! HE SIGHS He goes right into the water. Not so great. Epic fail. Look over there. And it starts right now. Straight away, into the water, nearly taking the presenter with him. It's just a complete anti-climax. He's got to focus on saying his line and looking at the camera. Look over there. And it starts right now. He's nailed the line. All he had to do was nail the jetpack. The people in the studio are like, "What?" They have lost it. Is he going to be OK? Is he going to come up out of the water or not? Oh, my God...! Here he comes! What is that?! Like a god, out of the water. What is that?! Flying up with a big smile on his face. And you can see on his face, it's better than any sexual encounter he's ever had. What is that?! Can someone please tell me what's going on? He rose like an eagle! He's a phoenix! I think he felt like Superman when he came back out. It was like... # Da, da, da! # He recovered like a pro. Cherry on the top. Perfect. Oh... my God! It's like, you know what - I'm not having this. I'm going to show you that I CAN jet pack. Despite the majestic rise from the ashes, the disastrous launch attempt was what made the news, and Fox 5's failed Bond-style jetpack stunt ended up splashed across the tabloids. And the reason for the epic fail? John had pressed the kill switch instead of the throttle. Starts right now! It's somebody with too much time on their hands, who's obviously not having enough sex. He needs to just go out and have a drink. Interviewing a man on a jet ski is easy, but mega-stars are something else. Unlike the bright and sunny graphics that accompany the KTLA morning news show, an interview by the usually unflappable showbiz reporter Sam Rubin with Samuel I Jackson would leave a rather dark cloud over the studio. Samuel I Jackson went on KTLA, which is the local Los Angeles station, to promote a movie. I am really snooty and sneery about "entertainment correspondents" and about all this celebrity culture. But he hadn't really actually done all of his homework. He was a little bit careless. I tell you what, working for Marvel, the Super Bowl commercial, did you get a lot of reaction to that Super Bowl commercial? What Super Bowl commercial? Oh, you know what? I... my mistake. I... See, you're as crazy as the people on Twitter. Right... I'm not Laurence Fishburne! How stupid must he feel to have mistaken Samuel LJackson for Laurence Fishburne and go through the whole interview with Samuel I Jackson about Samuel I Jackson in a movie Samuel LJackson's in, and then refer to a commercial that Laurence Fishburne is in? Maybe he had done one in Korea somewhere. And, you know, he's thinking, does he know about that? That's my fault. I know that. That was my fault. My mistake. You know what? We don't all look alike. We might be all black and famous, but we all don't look alike! I am... I am guilty... He was actually remarkably amiable, considering that it was the most racist thing that this guy could have done. You're the entertainment reporter?! I know. You're the entertainment reporter for this station? And you don't know the difference between me and Laurence Fishburne? I know... My mistake. My mistake. I apologise. Don't ever mistaken me for Laurence Fishburne, because I will end your career. Samuel I Jackson won't let him off the hook. Oh, you going to try to wiggle out of this? I'm not letting you wiggle out of this. You're not going to wiggle out of this. And the guy was like, "Oh, but you know, erm..." No, no, no, no. "Oh, but what about...?" No, no, no, no, no. You're not going to wiggle out of that. Let's talk about RoboCop. Oh, hell no! LAUGHTER Really? Really?! My... I apologise. I'm the other guy. Here was somebody who screwed up wonderfully. He's Samuel I Jackson, after all. Learn it. There's more than one black guy doing a commercial. There is. No question about that. I'm the "What's in your wallet?" black guy. OK. He's the car black guy. There it is. Morgan Freeman is the other credit card black guy. You only hear his voice, though, so you probably won't confuse HIM with Laurence Fishburne. You're exac... You're a... You're 100% right. And he just won't let it go. He won't let it go till the end. And I don't blame him. Do we want to do a list of all the people that you're not? And I've actually never done a McDonald's or a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. I know that's surprising. Right. Fair enough. Fair enough. That's, like, brilliant. It's such a great piece of television going wrong. Still to come, it's totes cringe when one girl has trouble singing aloud.. SHE SINGS BADLY ...and the Six O'clock News has some unwanted guests. WHOOPING I do apologise if you're hearing quite a lot of noise in this studio at the moment. Ooh, Lordy! Something seems to have appeared to have gone wrong! MUSIC: My Favourite Waste of Time by Owen Paul Most TV shows preferred artists to mime, but lip-syncing to backing tracks on live TV isn't without pitfalls either. Everybody just always mimed to a backing track. Owen Paul had one major hit, which is My Favourite Waste of Time, which we can all sing. If you put it on, everybody'll start, "Oh, yeah, I remember that!" In 1986, Scottish pop heart-throb Owen Paul experienced the mother of all backing track blunders. Pebble Mill was a daytime TV show, a little bit like The One Show is today. It covered the... depressing topics of the time - how to make a pina colada for your barbecue, that sort of thing. Owen Paul at Pebble Mill has got to be one of the most classic bits of telly. And will you welcome, please, a young man who's about to have a big success in the charts with his latest single, Owen Paul, and My Favourite Waste of Time. It was my first national television with Favourite Waste of Time. I wasn't in the charts. Or I was just outside the charts. So it was very, very important for me that it worked well, which it clearly didn't. # My... # You're my favourite waste of time # My... # Baby, you're my favourite waste of time. # He misses the cue, for some reason - maybe that he didn't hear the sound or something didn't happen at the front of this performance. So he does what a lot of people would do, which is, "I'lljust wait for them to cue it again." # Here I am I'm playing daydreaming fool... # He doesn't communicate at all - he just stands there. I've never seen anybody miss a cue for that length of time, though. I mean, she quite clearly said, "Owen Paul." And he just stood there, going... # You're the one that I love cos you're # My... # If you were watching that, you can hear the track if you're a viewer. But to me, there was just deathly silence. # My... # Back in those days, there wasn't there was none of the in-ear monitoring or anything. I just could not hear the track. And then, after a while, I was not going to join in even if it came back on. It's almost like someone's sort of hit the pause button. It went properly tits up. There was chaos. People running around the back. Paul Coia, the presenter, running up and down to my right. I could see all that. I could hear my band guys going, "What are we going to do?" I could hear all this. We were subjected to watching these guys just standing in a pretty unattractive exterior of Pebble Mill, let's face it. It was a bit like performing in an NCP car park. It had all that sort of glamour and feel to it, you know? # ..playing daydreaming fool again. # The ground to swallow me up - just doesn't cover it, really. # Who's got my head in the clouds above... # I just thought, "Oh, my lord," and this is going on and on. And I could still see the red light. I just thought, "Oh... "They're going to keep filming this. This is not good "This is not good." Maybe his favourite waste of time was just turning up to live broadcasts and just not singing. Maybe that is his favourite waste of time. I mean, it is a massive waste of time, isn't it? I mean, there's no point in doing that, surely. Oh, the irony of that song. When you unpick the lyrics it's beautiful. # Baby, you're my favourite waste of time. # When performing live in the studio, there is no place to hide when things break down. If the technology cocks up, it can leave some of the biggest and best pop acts sounding like a bag of cats. And even talent show judges can fall foul of technical mishaps. When X Factor's Cheryl performed at Stand Up to Cancer, her breathless performance, which she blamed on a microphone blunder, led to accusations that she was miming. Cheryl was "singing"... ...and then it all when disastrously wrong. It's Cheryl! SCREAMING To begin with, she is doing what most people do when they mime. They sing a little bit, and they do their breathing, and... # They might sing a little bit of the song. # Unfortunately, the backing track doesn't come with vocals and apparently neither does she. BREATHILY: # How d'you think I feel... # BREATHILY: # How d'you think I feel... NAME! TUNELESSLY: # Haven't you confused by the way I... change. # Someone hasn't put on the right track, so it's just the backing track that's playing with no vocal. BREATHY AND TUNELESS: # My name Say my name, baby. # It sounds like someone's overdubbed Cheryl Cole with, like, someone deliberately singing badly, and actually it's just Cheryl Cole singing, which is really embarrassing. BREATHY MUMBLING Sounded like a fire in a pet shop, didn't it? Call my name. Oh, no. Geordie. North-east. Doing her best. Breathy, useless, horrible. I mean, I noticed that when she put her hand in her ear, I'm not sure if somebody was talking to her. And she just switches straight away to, "OK, I'd better sing." # How d'you think I feel when you call my name? # You got me confused by the way I... # I have actually watched this clip a number of times and thought did they manage to somehow get her vocal on that track halfway through? But then you can hear that it's live cos you can hear her breathing. # I... # I love you too much to let go # How d'you think I feel when you call my name? # She really CAN sing. And this proves it above anything else. Football legend George Best put a broadcasting legend to the test when appearing on the chat show Wogan. Terry Wogan recorded 1,131 chat shows. Most of them, probably about 95% of them, were live. And as soon as George Best walks on, you can see Terry knows he's in trouble, because someone has allowed George Best to get a drink. I don't know who was dressing him up, but he turned up like, he was wearing everything that was green, and he though, "Oh, just project stuff on me. "I don't think I'll wear any clothes tonight, "I'll let the Wogan show decide." Why they didn't keep him away from hospitality beforehand, I do not know. But... there's a part of me that thinks probably they encouraged him because they knew that this would create a moment of television to remember forever. And at the beginning, the audience didn't know. So the audience would be doing this kind of laughing at everything without really knowing that this man was drunk. It's not nice to be in prison. No. LAUGHTER What are you laughing at? These people don't know what they're laughing at, half the time. So it was a kind of car crash waiting to happen. Terry Wogan is playing it really cleverly cos he's asking him some questions where George Best could go either way. So it's a very well-managed bit of live TV. Ladies are still important, yeah. LAUGHTER They keep laughing. I don't. LAUGHTER What about the booze? Is that important to you? The booze is still important, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. LAUGHTER Get off. Terry wrestles with the interview as best he can. He really... He tries very, very hard indeed. It's a difficult experience for all of them, and it's a difficult experience for us watching. They've got no idea what they're doing. And they keep bringing these mangers in, who've got no idea what they're talking about. And what they're... I mean, they talk a load of... Please. LAUGHTER You could tell Terry was uncomfortable, because Terry had a little habit. He had a habit of going, "Yeah..." Just giving himself a little bit of thinking time. "Yeah..." And then a beat. And that couple of seconds would give him time to think of another question or to react to what George had just said. He knows he's in trouble, but he carries on with the interview manfully. And then there was that killer question at the end. Using his cheeky Irish charm, Best had the audience in the palm of his hand. Terry, I like screwing, all right? LAUGHTER OK. All right. So what do you do with your time these days? I screw. I see. LAUGHTER Ladies and gentlemen, George Best. Ancl Terry knows, "I can't go any further with this," and wraps up the interview and says, "Thank you very much, George Best," cos there's nowhere you can go. 1988 saw a case of the news making the news when the BBC suffered a serious security breach. Newsreaders Nicholas Witchell and Sue Lawley came under siege from gay protesters. The Six O'clock News from the BBC, with Sue Lawley and Nicholas WitchelL Oh, and it's our favourite newsreaders, Nicholas Witchell and Sue Lawley. Brilliant. It's all going well. Suddenly you hear this noise in the background. "Oi! Hey, you! Oh! Eh..." ...challenge to the poll tax. SHOUTING OFF-SCREEN Tory rebels have said... You can just hear... HIGH-PITCHED MUFFLED NOISE ...in the background. Another prosecution involving undercover police... SHOUTING INTENSIFIES ...and alleged football hooligans has collapsed. No evidence was offered. I can remember it. You could hear the Six O'clock News people sort of, you know, their voices rising in some sort of panic. "What's going on?" ...while the closed cones signal a lot more chaos this summer. And then what sounds like people being heavily muffled. I would imagine they were being sat on. And I do apologise if you're hearing quite a lot of noise... SHOUTING CONTINUES ..in this studio at the moment. I'm afraid that we have rather been invaded by some people who we hope to be removing very shortly. It was just hilarious. It was like a sketch. Sue Lawley held it together beautifully. That's why she presented the news. You had to be able to do... Anything could happen and you'd have to be able to just carry on, in a perfect RP accent. "Oh, lordy, something seems to have appeared to have gone wrong." I'm afraid that we have rather been invaded by some people who we hope to be removing very shortly. Well, that's TV going all wrong because, you know, you're not meant to be doing... You're not meant to be having news in your studio. The news is seen as kind of, you know, we look over the globe and tell you everything that is important to you. And then suddenly, right, it's like, you know, fighting lesbians wrestling with your presenters, going, "Whoa!" Well, this was one of those occasions, rare occasions, thank goodness, where the news makes the news. So the Six O'clock News became the Nine O'clock News and Michael Burke had to report on it. They were protesting against a new law, which comes into effect at midnight, stopping local councils from promoting homosexuality. And this was all to do with Clause 28 that was coming in, which was to ban the promotion of homosexuality in any way from any council platform. Good evening, the headlines at six o'clock - in the House of Lords... SHOUTING I don't know how they got in there. That's just incredible. They must have had to jump through loops and over so much security to get into the studio. Good for them. And then they... They tethered themselves to various bits of equipment. MICHAEL BURKE: Outside the studio, one woman who had handcuffed herself to camera cables was cut free. Lovely. Thanks very much. Another and the piece of studio furniture she'd handcuffed herself to were parted in a corridor. Led away, the women repeated their protest. We're protesting about rights for lesbian and gay people. I think people forgot what the protest was about, and it became much more of an issue about how the BBC TV news studio could be invaded. Tony Hall, who was the head of news at that time, found himself having to go on the next BBC bulletin to defend what had happened at the BBC. Well, what happened this evening was intolerable. There'll be a proper inquiry and we'll make sure that this doesn't happen again on any of our news programmes. It was TV going wrong. That was a massive security breach. I suppose was forgivable then. It was absolutely appalling. You would never, ever believe it now. Still to come, a Spanish paratrooper is left flagging after a right royal cock-up on live TV... Oh... That's got to be painful. ...and an unwelcome guest hogs the limelight on Good Morning Greece. I'm live on TV. This pig is not giving up. World TV now, and when it comes to breaking news, any self-respecting reporter wants to be there in the thick of it. It's not just one street that's flooded in this area. It is street after street. Nowadays you get 24-hour rolling news. You've got to fill it somehow. And in November 2019, when overnight storms flooded the town of Kinetta in western Greece, Lazos Mantikos was there to cover the tragedy for Good Morning Greece. I went to Kinetta town, doing the late report. We have a very bad situation there. A lot of flooding in houses and cars. He's there, right there, right at the cutting edge. He's ready to report. I'm waiting to do the live TV, to explain all the situation there. He's got his facts ready. As they've thrown to him... Back in the studio, the host is introducing Lazos. There'll be warning you in your earpiece. "Here we are. We're coming to you. Five, four, three, two, one. "And off you go." PIG GRUNTING Aargh! Suddenly, oh, my God, I see in front of me one big pig. Ooh, nice pig. I don't know where the pig's come from. It's a very big pig, by the way. I'm live on TV. The pig, unfortunately, doesn't care. I don't have time to doing nothing. I run. The pig was sniffing him and pushing him and pulling him. The pig not stop to follow me. I scared. Very scared. And this pig is not giving up. Bless Lazos. He's trying his best. I don't feel very good because I go there for a very serious story and the pig confuses all this situation. Lazos is trying so hard to keep it neutral and just keep it professional. He's just trying to somehow make some kind of sense, having this giant pig up his backside. Aargh! In his ear feed, he can hear his colleagues wetting themselves. I love at me if I see this situation. I mean, I don't know why they keep on saying it's a female pig, as though that makes it any better. But Lazos was concerned this could be the end of his career as a TV journalist. Would I have a problem with my boss? Because I go there for a very serious story and then I have attack from the pig. I don't have time to say for this serious story. Lazos and the pushy porker were a headline-writer's dream and an instant internet hit. News media all over the world now wanted to speak to Lazos, but for all the wrong reasons. For two minutes video, I hear my name in worldwide channels. China. Mexico. Africa. Australia. America. Kazakhstan. I am a reporter for serious stories but all people, they answer me, "You are reporter with a pig?" "Oh, yes, I am me. Is crazy time." Star is the pig, not me. That's the thing that everyone's going to be talking about. Did you see Good Morning Greece?" The story was such a hit that Lazos returned to reunite with his co-star. I love this pig. I have on my T-shirt, you see it? Is Greek Miss Piggy. The real name is Marika, and I love her. According to the farmer, Marika the pig was actually feeling amorous after swallowing a lot of salt water during the flood. It happened for this story, that the farmer don't kill the pig because is very famous now. Is crazy for me, this. Is crazy, but I like. After his failed report, Lazos was inundated with fan mail from all over the world. Now people send me only pigs. Crazy time for me, believe me. News and current affairs programmes around the world expect heated debates. RAISED VOICES But in 2014, a heavyweight discussion between journalists live on Jordanian TV turned into a heavyweight slugfest. RAISED VOICES This was the most amazing occasion. You know, I've done lots of programmes where people have got their dander up. The insults then turned into a shocking on-air fight and went viral on YouTube. Neither of them are listening to the other. They're just bellowing at each other. But it's that magic moment when they start standing up and brawling, and then demolishing the studio furniture. The table is clearly IKEA, and you've just got grown men holding a table top. SHOUTING CONTINUES That is one situation where the cameras shouldn't pan out. You shouldn't pan out to see the table falling apart. Obviously, these people feel very strongly about what they are arguing about. To be honest, I thought I was watching the WWF. Could have been a real knock-down, drag out, Rocky V kind of moment. The pull, it's like... like a dance. The traditional Jordanian table pull. It goes back many centuries in their culture. It's how they resolve dispute. A ritual MDF dance. I would probably put them in two separate rooms and just let them speak on Skype. That's probably the best way to do it. Live TV broadcasts don't come much bigger than a national event, with audiences glued to their tellies. Oh, then she loved those big parades and big celebrations. Hours of meticulous practice ensure the event passes with military precision, so the pressure is on to make sure that nothing goes horribly wrong. Every October the 12th, Spain closes down for their National Day parade, televised live by national broadcaster TVE. And in 2019, millions watched at home as the ceremony unfolded live. It's the national day of Spain. It's this big prestigious event, and it's celebratory, and everyone's happy. A lot of very, very important people are at this event. You have royalty, you have dignitaries. King's there, Queen's there, President's there. You've got people lining the streets. It's a big deal. Paratrooper Corporal Luis Fernando Pozo had the honour of delivering the national flag, and cameras were everywhere, ready to capture the thrilling moment. It's such a big responsibility. You're proud of doing something like that. He's clone 600 successfuljumps. So you think, he's got this. Pozo has got this. The drama of the flag will envelop the whole community. Here he comes. Oh, look at that - the flag flapping in the breeze. He's flying through the sky, sees all these people, thousands waiting for him to land. Everyone's watching him, they're applauding. The descent is beautiful. It was almost like a Superman moment. CROWD GASPS Ouch! There's a lamppost! Oh... That's got to be painful. Ugh... Ruined Spain's day. It looks like it should have been in a cartoon. It looks like it should have had sound effects. He should have swung in and been like "woop-woop-woop" and then "BONG!" SLIDE WHISTLE REVERBERATING CRASH P020 is a bozo. CUCKOOS CHIRPING Tries to take his goggles and his helmet off, and I'm thinking, mate, keep that on - nobody needs to know who you are at this point. It cuts to the king who looks so disappointed. He's so getting fired in the morning. You're stuck there in your parachute with nowhere to go. He sits there like a cat in the tree for a good five minutes. They're kind of slow clapping him, like we do in a restaurant, if a waiter drops something. I thought someone would come and help him down or something, but they just left him hanging there. I think I would have just thrown my arms up and shouted "Spain!" And everyone would have erupted. Job clone. With millions watching at home, Luis Pozo's failed James Bond moment had left the ceremony in chaos. Having been dangling for what must have seemed an eternity, the hapless paratrooper was eventually rescued from his TV nightmare. Zzzz... Nrrrrrrrr... And up it comes. And he meekly goes down in this big giant wheelie bin. "Jump in this bin - you're rubbish." He's full of shame. "No, you ain't seen me, right?" Corporal Pozo's ceremonial cock-up went viral as millions shared his embarrassment around the globe. Thankfully, he wasn't hurt. Just a dent in his pride, his reputation, and the lamppost. Can you just imagine the amount of stick this guy is going to get when he gets back to his squadron? That couldn't have been more embarrassing for him. You know what - it happens, doesn't it? We've all flown out of planes and parachutes and hit lampposts at points. You couldn't write it. It just should not have happened. He should've practised. In 2010, millions of viewers tuned in to watch the live final result of Australia's Next Top Model, and with expectation at an all-time high, it was absolutely essential that the result was 100% correct, as host Sarah Murdoch soon found out. We went along to the live final of Australia's Next Top Model, and we were sat in the audience. It was, you know, it was a huge affair. This was on live primetime television. I think we even got a goody bag, if I remember rightly - something to munch on because it went on for hours. I've never seen anything that's this completely awkward. So, crunch time came. It was between Amanda and Kelsey. As the tension mounted, finalists Amanda and Kelsey stood nervously awaiting the result, while Sarah Murdoch kept the suspense going. It all comes down to this moment. So the winner, and Australia's Next Top Model for 2010 is... Cue dramatic pause for a little bit. And eventually she said Kelsey, to which all our mouth dropped, we were like, "Oh, OK." It's you, Kelsey. CHEERING It was like party poppers, explosions. "Thank you to my mum, my dad, auntie, my nan..." And we were still clapping. I want to thank the runners up, they've been amazing, and all the girls for keeping me on my toes! And this really heartfelt speech was said. And then suddenly there was this moment on the presenter's face, like she'd left the iron on. She was like, "Oh..." Oh, my God. I don't know what to say right now. I'm feeling a bit sick about this. No... The moment that she was obviously told in her ear, you saw this blind panic come across her face... No... ...her eyes kind of widened, like rabbit in a headlight. This was brilliant. The awkwardness was priceless. She looked a little sick and a little uncomfortable. This is not... This was a complete accident. I'm so sorry. It's Amanda. I'm so sorry. GASPS AND SQUEALS It was fed to me wrong. Never have I been in a situation where the presenter's got it SO wrong. I love that she blamed live TV as well. It's OK... This is what happens when you have live TV, folks. I'm so sorry. It's OK. This is... This is insane. Insane, insane, insane. No, it's not. Every other show manages to get it right. I should imagine that behind the scenes they were trying to work out had she been given the wrong name by us? Had we fed her the wrong name? Has she said the wrong name? IS it the wrong name? Now, call me a cynic, but she was fed the information two minutes after my hands were red raw clapping. So it was like, someone backstage must have literally been going, "Shall fess up? No, I won't. Shall I fess up?" So by the time they kind of figured it all out, it was probably at least two minutes before she was given the right name to be told, "Look, we've made a mistake." It's an honest mistake. It's fine! It's all right, Sarah. It's fine! Woo! Kelsey was like, "Don't worry about it." I was like, that is just the politest, most pissed off "Don't worry about it" I've ever seen. Despite the fact that the show decided to give Kelsey the trip to New York and $25,000 as compensation and a big apology - yeah, it was a nice gesture. But, no, it's not enough. Every time she gets the call for a gig, she's probably like, "Are you sure? Can you double-double check that it's me... "..and not that bitch Amanda?" Announcing the wrong winner. No, that's not a pretty sight. In 2015, the technology wasn't to blame when international beauty pageant Miss Universe host Steve Harvey crowned the wrong Miss in front of half a billion viewers. These hosts, what I love about them is, they're so pampered, they're so used to being told they're right all the time. But in a live studio audience, it just won't cut it. You're thrown to the friggin' lions. This was an enormous night. I mean, you don't get much bigger than this huge beauty pageant, humungous stage, glitzy, glamorous, all the rest of it. This is the one you want to win, right? Everyone is wanting this. So it's now between Miss Colombia and Miss Philippines. The tension is high. They're holding hands in the middle... Miss Universe 2015 is... Colombia! CROWD CHEER The crowd goes wild. She's there. She's got the crown on. She looks so pretty. She had, like, the glitter cannons and the streamers and everyone going mad for her. And then you see the host just creep onto the stage. He really does just kind of creeps in like this and creeps up. You know, "Ladies and gentlemen, I've... I've made a mistake". I have to apologise. CONFUSED SCREAMING The first runner-up is Colombia. CROWD SCREAM AGAIN I don't think she realised actually what had happened and that she had won. It was just such a balls-up. He read out the name of the first runner-up! Like, this would never happen on RuPaul's Drag Race, Steve Harvey. This is exactly what's on the card. I will take responsibility for this. It was my mistake. It was on the card. He kept showing the card, which had, you know, "1st runner-up" and "winner" and saying... just trying to excuse himself, in a way. "It wasn't me, honest. Look how the card lays out. "It's so complicated. "It involves reading words of more than one syllable." After everything that happened, I think the production team were trying to salvage what they could. So they zoomed in on the winner right up close. But you couldn't help getting the feeling that they were just cropping poor Miss Colombia out. You kept thinking, "Oh, my God, Miss Colombia, what must she be feeling?", and you wanted to see. But they were very careful. They didn't show her. That's the thing about awful car crash television. You want to see the worst bits. Isn't that awful of me? But the thing is, the other girl's still got the crown on. That crown isn't hers. Give it back! And then it takes some poor girl to come in the middle and take the crown off her and put it on the other one's head. That really is a kind of heart-stopping moment for anybody when you say, "Hang on a second, take the crown off her, "take back the flowers, take away the cheque, we've made a mistake. "We'll be right back after this break. Taxi!" Still to come, Bobby Davro takes stock of his comedy career. I really don't like to watch it. He went smack on the floor on his face. And things go horribly wrong for Anthea Turner. I can smell the most horrible smell of singeing burning. How could this have happened? In the fast-paced world of the newsroom, trying to stay on top of the stories as they happen means there's always the chance of an almighty cock-up, such as the case of Guy Goma in 2006, a TV disaster so momentous that it's now legendary. If I have times of great stress, times of great trouble, times in times of difficulty in my life, I can always turn to Guy. This poor chap's turned up, perfectly respectable guy, great CV, for an interview to be part of the BBC's IT unit. Apparently, there were two people called Guy coming into the studio that morning and one of the runners was sent down to find the other guy, called Guy. They said, "Is Guy here?" They went, "Yeah, Guy's here". "Can you send Guy up?" Unbeknownst to the person behind the desk, it wasn't the Guy they were looking for. It was a different Guy. And he's got swept into make-up. He's then introduced and put in front of a camera. And at that moment he suddenly realised, "No, they're not filming the interview. "I'm broadcasting to the 11 men and a wet dog who are watching". Well, Guy Kewney is the editor of the technology website News Wireless. Hello. Good morning to you. Good morning. He was totally in the wrong place and he sort of went... He doesn't panic. You'd think, "Oh, Guy's going to panic". He's going to answer the questions. "I can answer these questions". Were you surprised by this verdict today? I'm very surprised to see this verdict to come on me. I love the way that the journalist interviewing just carried on regardless, because it must have been blatantly obvious to her that this was an impostor, but she carried on. What a professional. Do you think now, more people will be downloading online? Actually, if you can go everywhere, you're going to see a lot of people are downloading to the internet and the website, everything they want. It represents the thing that we in television always live in total fear of - that we're live, we talk to somebody thinking they're somebody and actually, they turn out to be somebody different altogether. They must have thought, "No, it can't. It can't be. "We've not... this couldn't have..." There's so much pressure in a modern day newsroom. They're not listening. So what's on now is fine. It's taking place. "You're dealing with that, you're the presenter, Karen". The wonderful thing about Guy Goma is the compassion because he doesn't want to blow the whistle and say, "I have no idea what you're talking about. It's a cock-up. I'm here for a job interview". He thinks somebody is going to be seriously in trouble over this. This does really seem to be the way the music industry is progressing now, that people want to go onto the website and download music. Exactly. Somebody's asking some questions under some bright lights with a camera. And he answered them as best as he could. I thought they were pretty good answers. I mean, it's... if I was in Apple, I'd have given him a job. He should be running the BBC. If he can busk his head off like that for five minutes, give him the job. Most TV shows go perfectly to plan, but when high profile, shiny floor primetime shows go wrong, there's absolutely no place to hide, especially when millions are watching. Back in the '80s and '905, long before he tickled viewers on Celebrity Big Brother, huge audiences tuned in to watch cheeky chappy comedian Bobby Davro in his own primetime show. Public Enemy No 1, Public Enema Number 1, as I called it! Bobby Davro was huge. He was the funniest man on TV. He was one of those comedians who actually knew that we loved to hate him. He'd get celebrity guests on and take the mickey out of them and rip them to pieces, you know, regardless of what it was and what their status were. It was a sort of panel-cum-game show and celebrity show. It wasn't particularly great. It was family entertainment, completely madcap. We all knew what we were doing up there - to be insulted. At the end of this particular show that I did, we got our own back and we put him in the stocks. I was put in there. I don't understand why. There was nothing being thrown at me. This is before the age of health and safety being what it is today. And I think they just needed, for camera reasons, whatever, "Let's put the stocks and a couple of blocks, it'll be fine". You know, "Let's stick Bobby in these stocks and take the mickey". I'm sorry. It does make me laugh still. Lionel Blair, for some reason, takes his trousers down and the other three are in front, singing Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life! # Always look on the bright side of life... # My focus was really on Lionel Blair, Keith Chegwin and Jim Bowen because they were just up there doing the can-can. I was just thinking, "God, that's entertainment". AUDIENCE SCREAM I was very lucky that I landed on the wooden part of the staging in the studio, because if it had landed on the concrete floor, I would have probably broken my neck. Thank God Bobby was OK. Oh, my God! Oh, Bobby! Oh, Jesus! Keith Chegwin starts shouting out, "Bobby, oh, Bobby", because they're like brothers. They love each other. "Oh, Bobby!" Bobby! The piece is about Lionel Blair because he's like... And you think, "Lionel, you poor thing!" Lionel can see the horror of what's happening, but at the same time is trying to keep a showbiz face. You know when you drop something, and something good, and it's like in slow motion, "Will this happen?" And the next thing we knew, he went smack on the floor on his face. "There goes my career. "Oh, no, I'm dead". There was nothing he could do. And there was nothing we could do. What a way to go, face down with your pants round your knees with Lionel Blair during the can-can right in front of you. You've got one of the most well-known comedians in the UK... ...flat as a pancake on the floor! "I've had an accident. I demand compensation!" AS JOE PASQUALE: "I've had an accident, "I think I'm entitled to some compensation!" That's me, that is. Because you know he's OK, you can laugh about it. And because it happened to Bobby Davro, it's the most perfect joke in the world. So anyway, this thing had tipped over, crashed into the floor and then the thing came up and caught me right under the chin there, cut a great big hole in my chin. It was the most horrific thing I think I've ever been part of in anything that's gone wrong. It was dreadful. It's really painful to watch. Face into the ground, wooden block and you just hear people go "Uhh!" I really don't like to watch it. My parents were there. My mum was pretty shook up about it. But hey, I'm all right. But I didn't get any compensation. Nothing. The Bobby Davro clip is now used by the BBC on health and safety... ...in programme making! Sorry, Bob. It weren't funny. Thankfully, our Bobby survived without any long-lasting injuries... we think. Live TV has always been a risky business. All kinds of things can and do go wrong. But in the past, health and safety wasn't given the priority it is now. So the risk of disaster was ever present, as Anthea Turner found out. If you want something to happen to you... I have worked in television. I have done some risk assessments, and every time I sit down and do one, I go, "OK. How would you not kill Anthea Turner?" UP2U was a Saturday morning show which was live, and it was on BBC. Sometimes we'd be on location or we'd have one presenter out and about somewhere and the other presenters back in the studio. And then we'd have these live fink-ups and we'd all be chatting happily away to each other. It was the first show of the new series, and I was sent out to go do a live broadcast from the Royal Tournament. You couldn't switch the lights on, could you? Wow! Get a load of that. When we got down to Earl's Court, you know, you realised that technically speaking, there was an awful lot going on, because it's a big show. What normally happened was on the Friday, we'd all arrive and then we'd all rehearse. So we went through, we call it marking through sometimes, where they'll position you in a certain place and, say, "This is where you're going to do that link", just mark it through. And the idea was that I would be standing by a truck with the tailgate down and it had black sugar paper, so it looked like it was empty to the television eye. And I was going to say, "Oh, I thought I was going to be meeting the motorbike display team, "but I can't see anybody here". And then these guys are going to come out of the back of the truck, which they did and all was fine and good... on Friday. On the day, the director just said to me, "Actually, I think it would be better "if you just sat on the tailgate. "Do your piece to camera, jump off it and when you're far enough away, "We'll cue the motorbike to come out. "It's going to look a lot nicer". And if you want something to happen to you on... The bike has actually just clipped my shoulder and I'm now falling off the tailgate. I'm feeling very hot. My jacket set on fire. My microphone shield set on fire. And I can smell the most horrible smell of singeing burning. You do not want to be near a flammable stunt if you are covered in hairspray and polyester shell suit tops. One thing I feel slightly guilty about is the fact that because it wasn't my link, I wasn't ready. I was upstairs in the canteen, having a cup of tea, to be honest. I wasn't watching what was going on, slightly naughty, I'd taken my earpiece out, really naughty, and I was like, "Well, this is Anthea's link now, "so I've got a good few minutes to have a cup of tea". So I just was relaxing. Yeah, but I wasn't relaxing for very long! I couldn't hear very well the studio. I just said to the director, "Can you give me a visual cue as well to speak, "because I might not hear it". And this is where it all went wrong because the cue which was mine to speak got confused with the cue which was for the bike to come out of the back of the lorry. And actually, the gentleman who was in the truck cueing the motorcyclist wasn't a television professional. He was working with the display team. And maybe had it been a, you know, a floor manager, they would have got it. I hadn't seen it. So there I was being asked to explain and apologise for a situation that happened that I hadn't actually seen. So I was like, "So what's happened? She's what?" A few minutes ago, you might have just seen something a bit dangerous happen to Anthea. Just to say, she's OK. She's just gone to first aid and she's going to have a nice, hot cup of tea because she's got some shock, but she's OK. We'll carry on with the rest of the events. You know, this is live television. Things like this aren't supposed to happen. You know, we're supposed to pre-empt these things. And we rehearsed it. I thought, "How could this have happened?" I could have sat anywhere on that tailgate, because the camera just followed me. I chose accidentally to go to the right-hand side of it. Had I have gone literally two inches further to the left, that motorbike would have just gone right into the back of my head. The accident left its mark, and when she returned to our screens a few weeks later, it was clear for all to see. I looked a bit strange, really, for some time. You look very strange without your eyebrows and your eyelashes. At the Wembley... This actually did change a lot in television terms as far as how not to kill a presenter. I do star on the BBC safety video! We all have things that we're remembered for and synonymous for, and I think that will certainly be what she's remembered for. "Oh, Anthea, remember when you got blown up at the back of a truck?" "That's you, isn't it?" I bet she loves that. Still to come, ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown puts his foot right in it. It all got caught. You're never alone with a microphone. And news reporter Michael Crick hits the headlines. Disgraceful! You disgrace! He knew he was going to wind up Godfrey Bloom, and he did. I thought it might needle him a bit, but I hadn't realised he'd just go way overboard. When a politician tries to use the television news to his own advantage, it can backfire with irreversible consequences. When will politicians learn that if you're ever in a TV studio or surrounded by microphones, even if someone says that microphone is off, that microphone is 100% on? Hello. How are you doing? You would try and persuade politicians to put a radio mic on so that when they talk to voters and so on, you could capture what they were saying and what the voters were saying. And it's a lot less obtrusive than shoving a big microphone on a stick in between them. The 2010 election campaign was, if we're completely honest, a rather boring affair. And the real highlight was this moment when Gordon Brown encountered a voter called Gillian Duffy. My family have voted Labour all their life. Yes. Gordon, you know, just wasn't the best people person. You can tell he hates every moment of it. He's not naturally a performer. He's a very bright man. I'm sure he's a very compassionate man, but he's not really media-friendly or media-savvy. The biggest danger can come from a member of the public. And Gillian Duffy duffs him up on the issue of immigration. Well, all these Eastern Europeans what are coming in, where are they flocking from? Well, a million people come from Europe but a million people, British people, have gone into Europe. There's a lot of British people staying in Europe as well. These are meant to look to us, on television and to the audience, like random encounters. But by and large, they're selected beforehand and if they're supporters of the party, even better and they're meant to ask you something that you are able to deal with and might expect. To her face, he's sunny, jovial, you know, "Great to see you". Couldn't have been more friendly. Very good to meet you. And you're wearing the right colour today! How many grandchildren do you have? Two. What names are they? The conversation ended pretty positively, but Gordon Brown's view of the exchange was later caught on his microphone. This is the crucial moment where everything goes wrong. It's not while the crisis is actually going on, often. It is that moment in which you think you've got beyond the particular tension that your guard drops. Let's go. Oh, boy, does the world fall in on you. Good to see you. Thanks very much. When he gets in the car, you hear on the microphone the real Gordon Brown. It all got caught. This is TV going wrong for Gordon Brown in a very, very, very big way. We have a saying in television. It's an old adage. Everyone knows it. "You're never alone with a microphone". Turn it off. Of course, that brief encounter is forgotten almost immediately by Gordon Brown and his team, except, of course, Sky have got it and quite cleverly leak it out to their sources. Of course, the woman was absolutely outraged, as indeed anybody would have been. BROWN ON RECORDING: ..bigoted woman. I suppose it is a bit of a shock to be informed that the Prime Minister of your country thinks you're a racist old bigot! What did I say to be bigoted there? What was... what? What was bigoted in that what I said? There was an interesting ethical issue there because a lot of people in the old days would have said, "Well, he didn't know it was being recorded. "We shouldn't use that, it's not fair to him". But I think the decision was made that what he said in the car was so momentous, so telling, so interesting that that rule had to be discarded. I want to know what my politicians really think. It would be really nice. Everyone says, you know, "What we want is authenticity", and you get faux authenticity. You get the false bonhomie out on the street there, and some of them do it better than others. And you believe them then to be genuine, but they're not. Of course she's allowed to express her view and I was saying... Gordon Brown was on the Jeremy Vine show on Radio 2, which was being filmed, actually. You could see him. He sort of goes, "Oh!" He was then forced to sort of listen back to himself on the radio. The problem was that I was dealing with a question that she raised about immigration and wasn't given a chance to answer it. And then he had to go back to Rochdale to go and apologise in person to Gillian Duffy, visit her at her home. I remember standing with the rest of the world's media in this tiny little cul-de-sac and up sweeps the prime ministerial motorcade and out gets an ashen-faced Gordon Brown and trudges up to the door of Gillian Duffy's house. I've just been talking to Gillian. I'm mortified by what's happened. I've given her my sincere apologies. That was rather patronising to think it could be patched up in that way, although he obviously had to make the gesture. It must have been one of his bleakest moments as Prime Minister. Sometimes you do make mistakes and you use the wrong words. And once you've used that word and you've made a mistake, you should withdraw it and say profound apologies. And that's what I've done. Funnily enough, I was filming with him a few years later and we'd done our interview and he wandered off and he'd left the mic on again. And I thought, "Didn't you learn from the last microphone catastrophe?" Testing, testing... times indeed. A regular cause of TV going dramatically wrong is the telly meltdown, and even the most consummate professional can succumb to seeing red. Like BBC Panorama reporter John Sweeney, who provided us with one of the most jaw-dropping moments of TV going wrong ever seen on our screens with this outburst. YOU WERE NOT THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERVIEW! John Sweeney has got a real reputation for robustness. He is, or was one of one of Panorama's thugs. I thought, you know, I mean, when his foot is in the doorway, you know, that door doesn't close. In 2007, John took a snoop into the world of Scientology. The Church of Scientology is, according to its great apostles Tom Cruise and John Travolta, a wonderful thing that helps you communicate. Ex-members of the church say it's a sinister space alien cult. I actually watched the show in 2007, Scientology and Me, with a lot of interest and fascination because I had personally had nasty e-mails from Scientologists, having written stories about Tom Cruise and his relationship with the church that were negative. I have never felt under such psychological pressure then when I was reporting on the Church of Scientology. The following clip shows how important it was to Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis that the Panorama interview was also recorded on the church's own cameras. Could that have been a possible sign of mistrust? I would just like to... And I hope somebody is shooting this. OK, good. Rather, there's actually, to be fair... There's now been... ...there's one camera from BBC, one camera from your... No, you listen to me for a second. You have no right whatsoever to say what and what isn't a religion. Now, one thing you have to know about Scientology is they have something called Fair Game, which means if someone is attacking you, you can do anything to defend yourself. Whether it's illegal or immoral or unethical, it doesn't matter. They came to our hotel. They attacked and condemned the people we were interviewing, while we were interviewing them. There was a car chase in I., there were private eyes in our hotel room, in our hotel. And there was real, real psychological pressure. All this pressure came to a head when Davis confronted him one more time about an earlier interview. Listen to me for a second. No. You're accusing members of my religion of engaging in brainwashing. NO, TOMMY, YOU STOP NOW! Brainwashing in a crime! NO, LISTEN TO ME! YOU WERE NOT THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT INTERVIEW! And I just lost it. Brain washing is a crime. YOU DID NOT HEAR OR RECORD THE INTERVIEW! Do you understand? He comes across like a complete bellend. John Sweeney, you made Scientology look perfectly sane and normal and that you're the crazy one. I can't work out if John was trying to perform some kind of strange Jedi mind trick that didn't work. YOU ARE QUOTING THE SECOND HALF OF THE INTERVIEW, NOT THE FIRST HALF! Watching him explode like a tomato, which is what he called it, is awkward and difficult to watch. YOU CANNOT ASSERT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! Now, would you listen to me? As a good rule for life, don't lose your shit like that when cameras are around. I think that's quite, quite safe advice, really. It's a disaster. It's a total disaster. This is the power of Scientology, to drive someone almost to the point of madness, to behave in a way they would never, ever in a million years behave. What's interesting is that because the Scientologists had themselves filmed this outburst, they then put it out, broadcast it before the Panorama, and then, of course, the Panorama people think, "Crikey! What do we do?" The Scientologists' own amateur-looking close up footage focused on Sweeney's outbursts, not clearly giving both sides of the debate. NO, TOMMY, YOU STOP NOW! NO, LISTEN TO ME! YOU WERE NOT THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT INTERVIEW! Maybe they were hoping that the BBC would be so disgusted with John Sweeney's behaviour that they would can the show. John Travolta phoned up the Director-General eight times, saying that I should be sacked. The Director-General was in a meeting eight times - that's what he does for a living. The church even lobbied the UK Parliament to get the documentary shelved. The moment I lost it, I remember the producer Sarah Moll going, "We're going to run that." And I said, "Of course we are." When it finally aired, 4.9 million people tuned in. So there was a huge amount of interest, and, actually, in the end, I think it was one of the most watched Panoramas in the last ten years. I believe passionately that civilised discourse is the engine oil of our democracy. It is how we should treat each other, and people in the public eye should not lose their temper. So, I apologised then and I apologise now. Despite the threats, the programme was a success, and Panorama went on to make subsequent reports about Scientology. Some news reporters, like Channel 4's Michael Crick, can find themselves at the centre of the news. A couple of weeks before the UKIP conference, I got an invitation by e-mail, and the first line was "Godfrey Bloom..." And I thought, "Mm, that sort of looks interesting." "..invites you to a champagne reception..." "Wow, yes. I'll go to that." "..on the subject of women in politics." Bloom on women in politics. I'm certainly going to that! Godfrey Bloom was a pretty controversial UKIPer. He'd made some awful comments about women being sluts cos they didn't clean behind the fridge. Was there a single woman in there that didn't laugh at the joke, you sad little man? He'd also said something that sounded pretty racist about Bongo Bongo Land. Something was bound to happen. Now, Mr Bloom, what do you make of the front cover of this... ...the conference brochure with no Black faces on it? What a racist comment is that? How dare you! That's an appalling thing to say! You're picking people out for the colour of their skin? You disgust me. Get out of my way! I thought it might needle him a bit, but I hadn't realised he'd just go way overboard. What's appalling about making that point? You, sir, are a racist! Somehow, I pressed a button and it exploded. Why am I racist for saying there aren't any Black people? And you've checked out the colour of people's faces. He then grabbed the brochure from me and started rapping me over the head with it. Disgraceful! You're disgraceful! And I thought, "Crikey..." You know, this is being captured by at least three cameras. Disgraceful! You're disgraceful! I've got to be careful here. You know, this could all go badly wrong. Your racism, that's a racist remark. Michael, of course, was completely above the board and fair enough. But he knew he was going to wind up Godfrey Bloom, and he did. We cannot have any one individual destroying UKIP's national conference, and that is what he's done today. Well, that was the end of Godfrey Bloom's political career. Will you have to resign over this, Mr Bloom? The consequences of TV going horribly wrong can be a lot worse for foreign correspondents reporting from a war zone. In 2003, the Iraq War was raging, and BBC reporter John Simpson was covering the fighting from the front line. John's a national institution, but he's always been a very brave reporter. BBC newsreader Darren Jordon gave an impassioned lead-in to John Simpson's tragic news report. The BBC's world affairs editor, John Simpson, was in the Kurdish convoy when it was bombed. He and other members of the BBC team were slightly hurt. He sent this dramatic report from northern Iraq. But let me warn you, some of the pictures may upset you. This was absolutely first-class reporting by John Simpson. What had happened here was an awful incident of friendly fire. And, obviously, he knew that he had to keep recording to tell the world what was really going on. And he manages to put together a piece that is both coherent and incredibly emotionally powerful. JOHN SIMPSON: We reached the crossroads. Then, out of the blue, the American plane attacked. When you're with someone like him, you don't think anything's badly going to go wrong just because, in a funny way, you sort of think he's sort of too big a figure to actually get hurt. I think what's amazing is that the cameraman, despite having been hit by shrapnel himself, keeps rolling. He keeps filming. SHOUTING AND YELLING That footage of him and his party being attacked by so-called friendly fire is just horrific. The team would go on to make a revealing documentary, giving the viewer a sense of what it might have been like to be there on that fateful day. It all looks quite promising at this stage. We were heading down towards what the front line was. There were very few Americans in northern Iraq because they hadn't been given permission to send their troops in. You could hear this incredible sound of what turned out to be American F-145 spinning round very low. The quick-thinking, experienced cameraman proves his worth by capturing the chilling moment when the bomb landed. My phone rang, and it was my mother ringing to say "Happy birthday". The sound got louder and louder, and I actually held the phone up so she could hear. Fred Scott, the cameraman, had basically been blown on his side. He managed to pick his camera up and he looked to see if the camera was actually working. And because he'd got a shrapnel cut on his eye, though he didn't know it, this drop of blood just fell on the lens just as he fired up the camera. So what everyone saw was this extraordinary shot. And I think it was probably the most powerful single shot that anyone... ...anyone actually managed to get during the entire war. As this BBC News report continued, it became shockingly clear just how close the team came to being killed. JOHN: The bomb had landed only ten yards away from us. I even saw it fall. Some of my clothes had been ripped off by the blast. It's all an appalling mistake by the Americans. And it's... You know, it's not the television people's fault, apart from the fact that they were there. But then they were there with Americans on the ground as well. I've been in a couple of situations a bit like that. Nothing like as bad as that. And you do feel an imperative to do your job. If there had been any doubt as to how near death the team came, John closed his report with a heartfelt tribute to his translator, who had died from his injuries inflicted during the attack. JOHN: But in spite of everything we could do for him, Kamran Abdul Razak died soon afterwards. Fred's sitting there with, you know, one of his eardrums blown out, John's got one of his eardrums blown out, they've all got shrapnel wounds. I've got... I've just had a inch-long piece of shrapnel taken out my foot. And yet we're still sat there, editing a news package for that evening's news. You're aware from this John Simpson report how perilous a journalist's job on the front line can be and how last-minute decisions, luck, all plays a part in whether you actually stay alive. My concern is, for fear of offending people at home, we shouldn't put out dark images, but these dark images are the truth. And the problem is we're mollycoddling these images. Now, do you want kids to watch them? No. Do you want war to be so pasteurised people don't understand its true nature? No. And I think for the moment, we've got the balance wrong. But that ghastly incident with John Simpson and the Kurds, that tells you the truth about war. Still to come, a grumpy cat leaves an Aussie TV host lost for words. There's nothing but the cat in shot and just his face. It's like Jabba the Hutt. And the '80s weatherman who caused a storm. Apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard that there's a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't. The man who made a complete mess of that weather forecast. I had nothing whatever to do with it. A news journalist doesn't only report on the serious stuff going on in the world. They also have to try and keep abreast of popular culture and the latest trends. In 2013, veteran news anchor Karl Stefanovic, from Australia's Today Show, was handed a fluffy story to cover. So, this was never going to be an easy task. When the Today Show producers picked up on a social media sensation... Grumpy Cat was an icon of the last decade. ...Grumpy Cat, also known as Tartar Sauce, from Arizona, became an overnight celebrity clue to her grumpy face. Even I know about Grumpy Cat. Like the most human, miserable face I've ever seen on an animal. Just looked a little bit miffed. Grumpy Cat's face was everywhere. There's books and T-shirts and things like that. As Grumpy Cat had a new book out, the Today Show producers saw an opportunity for an interview... with the cat. Grumpy Cat, good morning. Are you happy to be... doing this interview with the Today Show in Australia? They thought, "I know, we'll do a live link!" The Today programme think, "We'll put Karl on this "because Karl's a professional. Karl's trained." I'm sure this TV host is like, "Well, yeah, that's a good idea. "We'll bring him on. It'll be funny." What about Mondays? It's a Monday morning. It'd be your favourite day of the week, wouldn't it? The truth is, the cat is not going to answer, right? You'd think that maybe you'd be talking to the cat's owner. You've become a massive star on the internet. You must be pretty excited about the new book, yeah? He's asking questions to a cat that's got a face like a slapped backside. I'm going to ask you what you think of the politicians, our politicians, the leader of the country first. So, I'm going to ask you whether or not you like the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd? And this cat's just staring back at him. There's nothing but the cat in shot and just his face. And I thought, at some point, they're just going to cut away. But, no, we're still staring at the cat's face. We don't even know if Grumpy Cat even makes a noise. What about the opposition leader, Tony Abbott? The presenter, this dude's face is mad. Every time he asks a question, he does this ridiculous face. Karl suddenly realises that it's a bit embarrassing, and then he gets that really awkward laughter. HE LAUGHS Look at that cat! I think it hits him. "What am I doing?" HE LAUGHS And it just all descends into absolute carnage. And the cat is still sitting there like this. It's like Jabba the Hutt! Karl's awkward lowbrow interview hit the headlines... ...and his fit of the giggles was picked up by social media. What must have seemed like a great idea at the time ended up a bit of a clamp squib. All right, this has been good. I look forward to catching up with you when you get to Australia, OK? It's sort of amusing for a little while. And then after that, it's kind of like, "Oh, now this is getting a bit toe-curling." HE LAUGHS Look at that cat! He's probably a trained journalist. He's sitting, considering all the work he's ever done in his life and how he's ended up sat, interviewing a cat. I've got to go now. THEY LAUGH And now for the weather. How can that possibly go wrong, especially in the hands of seasoned professionals? I've got to speak slowly. You know, the Great Storm of '87 scarred many weathermen very deeply. Good afternoon to you. Earlier on today, apparently a woman rang the BBC and said she heard that there's a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't. Don't worry. There isn't. ECHOES: There isn't. There isn't. The worst storms for centuries have swept across southern England, killing at least 12 people and paralysing a quarter of the country. They came without warning in the early hours of the morning. The storm that night was huge. It was the kind of storm of the century. Huge trees, things that had grown for years, were uprooted. I remember lying in bed and hearing the roof tiles crash off, thinking, "Yeah. Thanks, Michael." I had nothing whatever to do with it. The wrong forecast was prepared by the Met Office. Well, the incorrect broadcast was done by Bill Giles. He was the one that played the whole thing down. Now, it looks as though most of those strong winds will stay away, although it's still going to be very breezy up through the channel. My broadcast, which had been earlier, there's some extremely stormy weather on the way. Now, as I've said to Bill many times since then, "I don't wanna go sailing with you, William, "cos I don't think you're up to this. It was a bit more than breezy up the channel." I remember getting up to do the one o'clock news. I was going in at 5:30 in the morning, and all you could hear was the burglar alarms going off in all the shops. There was no power in the studios at all. And they said, "We're going to have to send you down to the Thames Television Studios," where they've got what we call a bubble, a tiny little television studio that you can go live on air. It is 6:45 and this is Good Morning Britain. Hurricane winds have devastated... So I sat there thinking, "I can't start doing a really serious "hurricane programme with Bugs Bunny there." And the only thing I could do, cos I didn't have any of my wardrobe with me, was turn it round. So I presented the rest of the programme back to front. That morning, going in, I had to go down to Lime Grove down the A1, when everybody was standing outside. And, of course, it was my fault, even though I had not been involved. The weathermen in those days, I mean, they were almost godlike. They were figures that came into our living rooms once or twice an evening, and everything they said was gospel. Now, John Kettley from the weather studio is with me again with, I think, some more information about just what the situation is. We eventually got up to a TV centre. We found an emergency little studio, which was Phillip Schofield's, Nicholas Witchell and I. We must apologise for this rather makeshift Breakfast Time service which we're bringing you. Lime Grove Studios, the home of Breakfast Time, is out of action this morning as a result of the bad weather overnight. But the most ridiculous thing is I had to try and explain what was going on, and I knew nowt. I didn't know a thing because I couldn't even phone the Weather Centre - the power lines were down. As the severity of the storm became clear, the weathermen were being grilled as to why they hadn't predicted it. The duty weatherman this morning, John Kettley. John, why didn't you predict this? Joining me now from the London Weather Centre is the BBC's weather forecaster, Ian McCaskilL Well, Ian, you chaps were a fat lot of good last night. Ian McCaskill was still there. He'd gone in the night before to do the night shift at London Weather Centre, and he was still there when I left. He did virtually a 24-hour shift. Nobody could get in to rescue him. If you can't forecast the worst storms for several centuries three hours before they happen, what are you doing? The image of the Met Office went down severely. The BBC perhaps couldn't be trusted the same with their weather output, just because of this one storm. And despite everyone remembering it... Earlier on today, apparently a woman rang the BBC and said she'd heard that there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry. There isn't. But having said that, actually, the weather will become very windy. ...the famous phone call in to the BBC didn't happen quite the way we all thought. But there's a vicious... The actual truth is that nobody rang in to the studio at all. What really happened was that a cameraman from the studio made a call to his mother, who was about to go to Florida, and was very worried about a hurricane that was in that area. Every time anyone meets him now, all these years later... The man who made a complete mess of that weather forecast. Poor Michael Fish. We'll never, ever have the same problem again. The computer analyses these days are so much more superior than they were at that time. I've got my fingers crossed, though, when I say that. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
