What do you mean alien, hand next to realm? We need to be united right now. Does the meat leave the nail? You made the whole neighborhood stand up. Sometimes you don't pee on a cut finger! What kind of society have we become? Please... [knife sound] We talked among ourselves, okay. You go. Mr. Arif, don't give us any trouble. What are we going to do, are we going to be beaten here?

No. Are you ready bro? -Whereat? -I need to find Ceku's time machine. We haven't used it since her dowry. Why is that? What do you need, Arif? Son, they won't let you live here. I will send you to the time you arrived last night. When you hit the oblique over Venus like this without entering the atmosphere, you are directly in Gora. I came to Earth. I will be human. I will not go. Damn boy, come here! [neighborhood] SWAT don't be surprised, don't lose your patience. [asker] Move, move, move! [local] ...our patience... You are very rude, Mr. Arif. I will not go even if I die. I will not go. Is this friendship? Is that what happens in the movies? Did Ayhan Işık ever do this to Sadri Alışık? Did Zeki ever sell Metin? -Stump Necmi, to Saban… -Cut it off, cut it off. What are you talking about? You've heard and heard about movies. The world is that world? They will not find your dust here, your dust. Don't give me nostalgia by making it up your ass. Damn boy, I went to a space, my mother cried. I don't have one friend. The man has no tolerance for his own kind, who fucks the robot here? Don't ever look at me. Sit over there. Gee. I didn't think there was such a thing as friendship. Robot. Look, don't abuse me with your two-megabyte mind. I'm here trying to save your ass. Who are we talking to, huh? You will also be human. Who is it that will be you, huh? He had seen it in a movie and it was like that. Which movie is this? -I watched it... -Kezban is in Rome! Watch some Zeki Demirkubuz. Look how lonely there is. -Nuri Bilge Ceylan? -What? [door opening sound] Repent, my Lord. Arif, there is something I want to tell you. 216, look, my dear brother, This is not the Turkish movie we watched, okay? The men after us are not inspector Hulusi Kentmen. Let me love your eye, return to Gora. -Live peacefully for a thousand years, okay? -Let me live a thousand years, huh? Forget black and white movies too. I already forgot. -[asker 1] All out, we're clear. -[asker 2] Pay attention. Here, press it when it's hot, okay?

Piece of fuck, fucking face, face of a cocksucking piece of shit, God damn it! Son, did you see how it fit in my mouth? -[216 mutters] -[Arif] Press, push! -Head to head! -Am I pressing these two... Bas lan! [asker] What the fuck was that? Lan! -Arif, are you okay? -What did you do? Where did you press? I just translated it. Damn boy, why are you adding me, why are you teleporting me, huh? Give it! Look there, wallet, phone... Dude, why should I freeze? Did you play with something? I did not do anything. I adjusted it to cotton, this is probably synthetic. Son, I'm black and white. People are swimming in the Bosphorus, where are we? The modest district of Istanbul, Sarıyer... '69? You did it on purpose, didn't you? You did it on purpose, you played with history. Arif... [sci-fi effect] It's the same you if it's colored. Are you saying so? I can't travel like this. [old Turkish movie soundtrack] You did it on purpose, donkey, donkey, you did it on purpose. What do those guys want from you? They are so rude. Excuse me sir. With your permission. Come on. Have you heard? What a kind person. I heard, I heard. Oh look mom, clown! Tuna, what a shame. It is not displayed manually. Excuse me, are you a clown sir? Clown sir, yes. I am the woman with the mustache, I am her aunt. We are at Şehzadebaşı, we are at Medrano Circus. Please wait. Is that so? We hope to participate. -Have a nice day. -Have a nice day. Here you go. Thanks clown. No son, no. Come, come here. Son, don't deal with people. What are you doing? Don't play with history. You're getting too much attention, don't do it. They never surprised me. Even the kid loved it. Oh photographer... [old Turkish movie soundtrack] How happy are people. There is peace, peace. A place for myself. Arif, I wish we could stay here for a while. Hee, we watched these movies a lot, my lion. Fly fly. -[kids] Uncle, help. They shoot... -Stop, stop. You don't know how good these are, brother. Little boy, are you crazy? Leave me alone, my handsome brother. Don't fight, son. My beautiful brother, is it bothering you, brats? They fight with little kids. -Gee. - He took the clock. Brother, they went this way. Come to hop mandepsia. [moving music enters] [moving music continues] -Where are they? -According to my intuition, this is the side. Take it slow bro. You hit the yogurt shop just for nostalgia, right? There's no other man left, is there? -Run! -Excuse me a lot, yoghurt maker. [moving music continues] Hold, hold. He's the thief. lol! Open it, open it. Master, master, what's going on? There is a thief! Includes entry! No bro, such things happen in our neighborhood. Oh, it's done! Isn't it shameful? You raised the neighborhood. And is it ever called a thief? What shall we say? Gee! Open it up bro! If you open. [216] We live for our dignity. We have no eyes on anyone's money or honor, sir. Bulb, what are you doing there? Come over here. [door knocking sound] What's going on, for God's sake, what is this like a creditor? My brother, the kid's clock rang, he just went in. Bring the clock! Nobody steals here. It's okay. Also, don't you have that homogeneous neighborhood tribune? What are you talking about, lady? No clock, no. Look, its place is clear here, its trace is clear. Can not you see? I don't see it. [dramatic music enters] Of course I don't see it. I do not see! [brake sound] [bumping sound] [romantic music enters] Are you okay? I am good. I'm fine. [female] Pink Candy! Look ahead! Are you blind? Leave this to me. Don't you see the big car, bro? My dear! I said, 'I'll add some color, too. [from the neighborhood] Halal bro. Good luck! Helal olsun be Arif Abi. How did you infect your man, but... Violence isn't the solution, but it's her own itching. - Hop, it's hours. -Thanks. - Enjoy your meal, pasha. -What a hassle. Miss, don't you have me? I got it from my neighbor. Two came out. Here you go. -I'll pass. -I'll take it. Pink sugar is our dear. We cannot live without it. We die, my God. Bir tanemiz o. [together] He is our soul!

No no. Arif, there's something I need to talk to you about. Brother, what are you busy with? -I uh... -Well, friend is a clown at the Medrano Circus. Yup. She is a method actress, she never takes off her make-up and costume. His nose fell on the way too, while he was chasing the boy. I mean, it was just like that, normally. So he is arrogant, he will not take it if he falls to the ground. [laughs together] [Pembeşeker] Hey you? -He says to you. -No, he's telling you. I thing, carpet, rug, travel... Well, well, same circus, same circus games with bovine and ovine animals. With animals. Me too, Tonoz Hayri. aka Wooden Ass.

[Virtue] Ah, my beautiful daughter. My son who sees more beautiful than those who see. [Kemal] Let's call it fate, what shall we say? But of course we will open your eyes. What day are we waiting for, of course we will open it. We will open it, we will open it, evelallah. We will do whatever it takes, we will open those eyes. Fuck it, everybody's a doctor now. -Ha? What do the doctors say? -one hundred. No need to go outside. The surgery was performed here as well, but they say 100 thousand liras. What happened? Come on, let it go, for God's sake. Are you kidding? Fuck the things we know. Let's get the girl operated on, let's shrink Tonoz's stomach too, Let's put a platinum on Chitlembic's foot. Will this neighborhood's surgery be over?

Love it, I said. I praised you. Now you have a child, you are living happily. Good, isn't it? Donkey donkey. -Go away. -[216 grins] My soft-hearted Arif. -[man] I loved it. -[woman] And that? [man] He didn't know. Maybe if he knew, who knows? [Arif] My son. Son, this handsomeness is not such a visual thing. -This! [digital voice] -Brother! Allah Allah. Brother Arif, I found this, but I don't understand what it does. Son, everything finds you, huh. God, show me the mirror number, take a look. [216 coughs] Heh, heh, heh. You were an artist while drinking soup. I'm good. -Maybe it's a subtle disease. -Hey, it's done. [phone vibrates] Sir? Sir? Didn't they go? OK. Shut it down. This is the front of the house. OK, we're not coming back. I'll give you 24 hours, okay? Do you live your love, live what you live. 24 hours! -Bye Arif. -We didn't say live with me! -Goodnight. -[Handsome] Good night bro.

[engine cranking sound] [Ayhan Işık] Actually, it works if you put it in two and hit it. [engine cranking sound] -[Ayhan Işık] Are you okay bro? -Ayhan Işık? Sadri Alışık? Come on, don't be silly. Brother, I adore you. Stop. I swear I would be angry if someone else did it, I have to buy this bro. [takes pictures] God! Hashtag, shall I write "kings", kings? -What is he doing? -Ayhan brother, I'm writing something, old friends. The most valuable antiques are old friends. Well, there was an invulnerable body, I have an immortal soul. Cingöz Recai. Yes, the movie starts next week. -How do you know that? -Brother, who doesn't know him. -[Virtue] Arif! -[Pink Sugar] Ali! Where is -216, 216? -216? Robot, there was a robot next to me. I guess they put it in the car and took it away. -The car that went? -Yes brother. Android, it was at the wedding. He has such a piece on his head. He is my friend. Robot it. We were together in Gora, he came and said, “Brother, I'm human…” How they hit my head. Come on bro, come on. Let's go. Look, I wouldn't leave here if they gave me a million dollars. Friend brother, I can't leave it alone. Really, you know friendship best, brother. - Yes ? - Yes , of course. Take a look. Put this on film, Turist Ömer is on Star Trek . How? No, they say Sadri has flown. [Laughs] -No robots, robots. -[Virtue] Ah! [tense music enters] Normally, I hang people around Ajda from the ceiling by their balls. [tense music continues] But you are different. Who? Say, the Germans? I do not understand? So realistic. Let me see your arm. This is Besim Toker. I am the owner of Pertev Toys. -216, 2nd generation, 16th segment. -Okay okay. Drop them now. Now that you're here, that's enough for me. Look at me, get out. Why did you beat us? Where is Arif? Jealousy, madness, whatever you say. Let me apologize. Do you know what is love? -I know, of course. -I do not believe! I'm in love with him. I'm like a toy in your hand. Every night without sleep. Now let's leave that and talk business. I have been in this industry for forty years. I have never seen anything so magnificent in my life. Please follow me. Brother, I don't know, maybe he's back at the circus. Is it vinegar? -Are you okay, Arif? -I am not. By God, you don't know what will happen to us. By Allah, it's confusing here. We have men everywhere, we can find them. Where do you find it? Wait a minute, calm down. Look, my brother is childish, anyone can deceive him. By God, look. Why did I faint there? -Where is this pimp? -OK baby. Where? [joyful melody] Request! What have we done from the wind-up car to the battery-operated baby? Pertev brand is the favorite of children right now. Don't forget the toy. We are addressing here. Come on, let's work together, huh? My engineers are at your disposal. Let them rip you off. Let them get their schematics out, huh? -All my schematics are registered by me. -AA! Wonderful. Look. Let's produce hundreds, thousands of you. Let's multiply you. You become everyone's lover. You get into people's hearts. In people's hearts? Are you kidding me? Even the purse-seine broom sold over a million copies last year. Let's clean up. Think about it. Lover of children, teenagers and housewives. Friend, friend. -I? -What do you say? I don't know, my friend Arif knows. You need to talk to him. Arif? Of course. Who is Arif? Let's talk. It's okay, we'll handle it. -Do you think everyone likes me? -They die! I'm offering you 500 thousand liras. 500 thousand? Well dear, this is just the beginning. Then, of course, we make a detailed contract. Come on please. Please accept, please. Abi? What is that? pervin. How is my new project? [Besim Toker laughs] Everyone's favorite is a robot. Is it a robot? Is there a man in it? Like the man, right? No, we looked everywhere. We toured the whole Yedikule. Arif, I made a sketch of Ali. Let's hang it everywhere. The finder brings it to the coffee, huh? Where did the robot come from? Where did the robot come from? Did something like a robot come out of my mouth? [horn sound] I guess it came. Are you Arif Işık? Which one of you hit me? Where is 216? -[Handsome] Brother! -Don't worry, your friend is fine. What happened Arif, who are these friends? Don't worry, we'll understand now. Besim Bey is waiting for you at the mansion. Mr. Besim? -Who is playing Besim Bey? -Glory bro. Good. -Y, Ali? -Don't rush. I will come and get it. [children's voices] How would we work together? Were we going to save money or something? -They're gone. - Maybe they'll come. [party music] [Besim Toker] Ladies and gentlemen, attention now! Pertev, this jump is for you. [216 grins] -You're amazing, brother. -My dear, thank you. Arif! where are you? What's on it? Does it fit? Don't be silly. Who are these guys? Walk, we're leaving. Arif, wait two minutes. There is a great offer. Besim Bey offered exactly 500 thousand liras. I will be everyone's lover. Don't be prejudiced. Are you a maniac? -500 thousand? -Yup. Not Pink Candy, we can have the whole neighborhood operated on. Are you crazy? I told the guy I'm a robot, right? I did not say anything. He understood himself. I told you, don't play with history. We code in our minds as Arif, rich. They're actually good people. -Hi there. I'm Pervin. -Arif. Let me ask you something, do your eyes see? Pretty! Look, there are those who see it like this, go there, you must... Hah, my brother came too. Mr. Besim, Arif. Mr. Arif, welcome. Please feel comfortable. Your friend killed us with laughter. What was that? Fire, water, earth, wood. [Besim Toker laughs] Oh, and you're making my jokes too, are you? He's making up elements out of his ass. My friends, I invite you all upstairs. I have a big surprise for you. -What do you drink? -Do something. Surprise me. Look at me, don't go anywhere, okay? We're leaving right now. Mr. Besim! Look at me, does it make you a little jealous? -Why is that? -I do not know. I just threw a tequila, a wolf fell inside me. [moving music enters] Aylin! Darling. Mr. Besim! Mr. Besim! Mr. Besim! Mr. Besim! -[woman] Pertev. -[216] Nalan. [216 grins] Is it Pertev? Where did Pertev come from? Enjoy! Enjoy? Surprise, we said fuck it, we didn't say put him in a coma. You must be Besim's new friend. -Yes, hello. -Hi there. Can I ask you something? Of course miss. [216 grins] Excuse. What's your name? - Asshole! - Exactly! Ah, Zeki Muren! Sir, where and how a person will behave must know. -As they say, stone is heavy on its place, sir. -[laughs] Sir, I don't think every joke is made in every neighborhood. Otherwise, there are neither bad jokes nor anecdotes, sir. Ay, tell me, Mr. Zeki. Oh, sir, he's with the gentlemen now. Tell me, tell me. There is something, "Will Zeki Müren see us too?" What is this now? Well, there was something in the movie, Yılmaz Erdoğan's movie, It was a very catchy joke. Vizontele! Vizontele? Tuba, who is this impertinent one, for God's sake? Zeki Bey, the bandits did not rob us either. We come from another time zone. Sir, I hope in another time period... [laughs] Here is an anecdote for you. They're walking around like a joke, sir. [laughs] Welcome, my dear friends. Today is the happiest day of Pertev Toys and me. Where you play and have a good time all day long My dear friend Pertev has a surprise for you. Let me see, baby. Pertev! [cheers] -Where are you going, man? -Besim Bey is calling. Will you excuse me dear? Here is the latest wonder of our company. Friend of people, soulmate. And I detonate the bomb. -He's a robot! -[guests are surprised] Neither Pertev nor his robot? What are you talking about? Come over here. [Besim Toker laughs] You didn't believe it, did you? Here is the latest wonder of our company. Pertev robots. [guests are surprised] It is an invention that will change the world. You thought it was human, didn't you? -2nd. generation, 16th segment... -Not him, not him, honey. Hi, do you wanna be friends? There is no such thing. There are no robots! What toy are you playing like? There is no robot. What project are you talking about? Come over here! -Arif, will you calm down? -What will I be calm about? Gentlemen, would you please take Mr. Arif to my room? Come on, let's talk. Okay, let's talk. Come. OK. A somewhat excited guest. Let me check late my dear. Distribute some of these as well. Let's be friends? My friends, all the detailed information about our investment is in these brochures. Please come in. Is it a robot, sir? Isn't that an empty dream? What, you don't like the name? Pertev is my late father's name. 216 seems so cold to me, like a door number. Look, master. Do you think you can fool the child into being naive? Cunning with the extension sandals! How much money do you want? Take five. Damn pink panther! The mint has not yet minted the money to buy us, what are you talking about? The pink panther? Very good idea! You're a tradesman, ten thousand more. How many are there? Are they hundreds? These are 100, 10, 15. OK 50. 50, 60, 65. 65? What's in it, 50? I'm offering 100,000. -one hundred? Then one minute. -50, 100. Brother, 15 is here. Two fives is 115 then. -A minute. -200? How many are you offering bro? I'm offering 100. You gave -15, this is 215. -215 more.

Everything is OK. -216! -Shit! -216! -Shame on you. Son, son, stop. You got it wrong, are you crazy? I was going to enter the Yaşar Usta tirade. Look, sir, I was going to say... You got me wrong. Hot side of money huh? What does it matter? All old money. What will it do for me? I was going to throw it in your face. It happens in the movies, son, it throws it in your face. I'm excited. Good luck Arif, thank you. You know I'm here for the pink candy. So, we accept Besim Bey's offer. -If the money is ok for you. -Son, don't be ridiculous! Take them off, we're leaving. -We're not going! -Look, robot, don't bother me. Let go of my arm. Oh friends, let's celebrate this beautiful day with dance. -Son, come and look. -I am a robot. This is my dance. Enough! Enough enough! -Enough. -Look at me, Polished Igbo! Be smart, this isn't a barn! If not a barn, what are all these cattle doing here? Is Zeki Muren released? No shame because. Output. Take off that outfit you're wearing, we're out of here. Arif Bey, whatever he says. Because he will be my father. [216 grins] Son, did your battery break, ibis? Then what are you messing with if you're not my father? Son, look, don't make a scene here in public. Ay, they fight a lot. Very sweets, ayol. Sorry, are you a robot too? Yes, my robot. My name is Terminator. You throw an iron 2.5 liras, you bend down, I take care of the rest. [guests laugh] [man] Awesome! E, you extended it, but no more! Get out of my house. Cut it out. Is this child your toy? What are you getting into for fame? Are these things we don't know? Is this why we came here? Don't touch it. I'm staying here, Arif. Son, look, I'm talking to you like a human. Like human huh? I would love to be able to talk like a human. But up to here. You have always been jealous of me, Arif, from the very beginning. Of course, you will always be the lead, you will make jokes, we will both laugh. What about emotions? When I became the star of this place and won the love of two people, you lost your temper. Your job is to pass the balls. Get out of here, Arif, before you embarrass yourself any more. Wow my coach. Does the dress make you talk like that, huh? You're throwing a brush at your friend for making sprats with two men? How much is your weight? You know money matters better, Arif. Tell me, how much did he sell me for? You are not really a person to be addressed. Ha! You're a bunny running on two batteries. Go to that girl, just say it like that. I'm a bunny too. -Arrogant! -[guests are surprised] [emotional music enters] You hit me, huh? You hit your friend Arif, huh? What privilege do you have, Arif? Well done... Good luck to you. Now you're human. You used to say, if the piece is missing, what do you have a heart to carry our friendship nor did he have the balls to refuse the offer of these snobs. No, no! No! No. -We'll handle it. -Good luck to you. Pay him immediately, let him go. Take this and get the fuck out of here. I can't see you. See your good. But you will remember me very much. Have you heard? Mr. Arif. Open up. I want my contract done immediately. Advance is also deposited. Let's not let anyone spoil our fun, friends. [Pervin] Sprat, he says, simply. Then we call it sprat. Sprat too sprat! Sprat too sprat! Sprat too sprat! So he won't come, Ali? Will he not return? Mankind has sucked raw milk. -Can this be done to us? -We loved Ali, be Arif. Is it worth upsetting that girl, dear? Hackberry, are you saying something? -Well, can this be done to us? -It was said, follow a little. Guys, I'm not good at romantic conversations like that. I came to say goodbye to you. [emotional music enters] Pink sugar, there are exactly 100 thousand liras here. You can open your eyes with this. Get. Hop! Allah'ıma 100 bin, ha. Mr. Arif, my brother. -Why are you doing this? -Let's say it's a disgrace. What do you mean, why are you doing it? Kemal, did you see? What did I tell you? There is hope, isn't there? People's hearts are not so dark. What's going on? Mr. Arif, thank you very much for the check, but unfortunately I am not blind. Doctor Flame. We have been working with Kemal Hoca for a social experiment for a while. Let me introduce you, Professor Kemal Beler. How? Do you see now? What experiment? Aa Arif Bey, "Do good people only exist in movies?" for a long time to question your thesis We are doing a research together with Alev. Thankfully, Tonoz Hayri opened his house to us at last. [Virtue is surprised] Aa! I was going to tell you, but there was no opportunity. We have accumulated a lot of data in this poor but honest environment. but unfortunately the situation is not very encouraging. As you see. Will it happen again? And when you're both gone Kemal Hodja said, "See, it means there are no good people!" said. But now this gesture of yours. What do you say, Kemal Hodja, is there any hope? Isn't Pink Sugar Blind? For God's sake, are you watching these movies with your ass? Are you seeing it for the first time? He's never been blind before or anything. Honey, if you can see, can I have the check? So you're writing a book, huh professor? Wow. So write me in the book, too. Say he's a good person. And say something, he didn't value money. Professor Kemal, I'll get my bag right away, let's go. Ok darling. -Lady Flame! -Ha? You gave a secret, let me give you a secret. There is no Ali, he is actually a robot. His name is 216. We come from another time zone with him. Is it a robot? Mr. Arif, when I say I am not Pink Sugar now, I am Doctor Alev I'll make up something weirder, I hope you don't? Otherwise, I'll laugh at it, in fact. Shh, no one will hear. What are you saying girl, what does it have to do with it? We are from 2017. Here you go, our tool is here. Girl, here's the time machine, you're stepping there. Is there such a thing as a time machine, for God's sake? I'm talking about concrete science here. What am I talking about? You set the time from here, you go from here. [laughter] How was it going, like this? Lan! -[Flame screams] -Yav girl, don't press that. -What happened, what happened? -Oh my God. Girl, it's a time machine. Don't play with it! Is this real? Arif! What if I have to stay in underwear every time I press it? Where are we? Arif. [mysterious music enters] Oh my God. Maiden's Tower! -The Maiden's Tower? -This is the Maiden's Tower. What year are we in? Is it 2017? Wait a minute. Arif! Arif, don't leave me. [mysterious music continues] Teacher! Pardon. Did you see? "Good People Only Happen In The Movies"? Trousers 34-32, jacket 52? -Sorry? -Don't make me look like a Terminator. -I do not understand? -You got it, you got it. Arif, where are we going, where are we going? Pink sugar can you walk, please? Look at me! I'm not Pink Candy. My name is Flame. Honey, the audience's head is on a potato right now. They don't get hung up on such things. What Pinkcandy, Flame? Look around, huh? You call me Sami too. Sam too. I'm not offended, I'm not offended. Because I'm going crazy. I am Sami. No, Arif is better. Wait! Çitlembik, Kemal Hodja, Handsome. -Meditation sister. -Come on! What the hell is going on? What's wrong with you? Where is Pink Candy? Ali brother fixed the façade. Pink Sugar went with Arif brother. [sad music] Arif'le mi? Come on, my lion, Mr. Besim said, you can come to the factory from there. Let's go, Eryetis. Let them tear me apart. If there's anything left of me, of course. "For figures like these, for all their flaws, are glorified in movies. heroized, and true goodness is nothing more than a mockery." Aman ya Rabbi! Why, why did he write such things? It is impossible to understand. You said you came from 2017. -Is this the future? -Of course not. There's a lot of shit here. But my name is Arif, I will break this game.

Your mind is elsewhere. I'm good. I am very good. We will grow, Pertev. We will be the biggest. You will thank me later. Arif said, "Even the most innocent people can become ugly for their own benefit. Man is inherently vulgar and evil." What did Kemal Hodja write like that? Anyone reading this is in despair. -Arif, look at this. -216. Come. [tense music enters] [electronic sounds] [enters electronic music] -Let's be friends? -No, no, bro. Arif. Look ahead, cow! Arif! Protect me. Arif, I'm afraid. Come like this. My God, look at this. It wasn't that much, there was some rudeness, but not that much. What happened? Come with me. Hah, the chicken returns. Remember, where there is chicken doner, there is hope, come. -Master, hello. -Aleykumselam. Make us two pitas. Chicken, right? No, but let me do it. [female voice-over] If Pertev Group hadn't worked with the Germans fifty years ago maybe it wouldn't be like this. But now they are huge. The big boss asked Pertev, "What about the human factor?" when we say, "Less people, less problems." says. - Now it's time for the documentary and the closing. - Germans huh! Master this friend? Pertev. They're so big, they're everywhere. But of course, robots are also given a lot of opportunities. [Arif and Alev are surprised] -Everywhere is full of robots. -Sorry? No, no, nothing. There is nothing. Shall I suffer? No, you already put what you want, thank you. Arif, I'm afraid. I want to go back. Take me home, please. I cannot allow such a thing. There is no such future, understood? No such thing. Good people happen in movies, there is no such thing. This book is a lie! You will rewrite this book. Understood? No such thing. Have a man, fuck his midwife... Don't make me talk. I wasn't going to leave that pimp there anyway. Do you have to use this language, man? Pink sugar, I'm begging you, look.

And betrayal. 216? Ali. Did you not recognize me? I know. Your eyes are open, but this time I don't see it either. [216 grins] What did you do like that? Was it worth it at least? Walk, we're leaving. I knew you would come. How? Have I prepared a good future for you? Pertev Group is currently the world giant. We quit the toy business. transportation, energy. We are everywhere. Managing the world is not child's play, Arif. You have built yourself a beautiful building. It never closes. Could you be everyone's lover? Became. I became more. I've given up on movies that open the eyes of blind girls. Love it Ali, do I have any memories too? I'm not Ali! You should have thought of him while you were running away with Arif. What escape? Are you crazy? I didn't run away, you misunderstood. A question for you. Does a heart that doesn't exist break? Broken. I loved someone for the first time. I lost both my love and my friend. It's almost a Turkish movie, isn't it? [216 grins] 216, brother, didn't you say you want a Turkish movie when you come? You have turned all sides towards Emmerichs and James Camerons. You were saying Ediz Hun, my son, you were saying Filiz Akın, man? You made Christopher Nolan yourself. Can't you see that there is not a single person left in the world? Of course I don't see it, I don't see it! There are no humans, but there are very good robots that I know, Arif. Look, robot, I'm going to give you a trust from 50 years ago now. -Behave yourself! -Arif! Ceku, honey! [tense music enters] Ceku? I have a short job, we'll be leaving right away. -I'm ready in five minutes. -Okay, Aşkitişkom. Ceku didn't recognize me. Ceku! E, you were not going to play with history, Arif Efendi. The first to go to Gora takes the princess. I will kill you. I kill! [Flame screams] It's too late to die, Arif. I died years ago. -Lan! -Arif! Where did you come from? Imbecile! Besim Toker! What's up? Are you in the steel cookware business? Pertev! Kill him! -Shut up, damn it's the fryer. -Ah! Son, look, these are not our things. It's not our stuff. [action music] [Flame screams] Stop, don't fight. Fuck it, there are two already. Wise! Wise! Nazar nazar. Enough! What are you hitting the girl, ibis? Come on, evil eye bead. You're right, I couldn't be with you on your good day. I was jealous of you. I also damaged your antiques. Forgive! The most valuable antiques in the world are old friends, Arif. Fly fly. I'll fuck your job. [tense music enters] Arif! Donkey! Arif! [Flame screams] -Thank you very much! Thank you very much. -We are living! Arif, freeze again. Honey, do I want to be like this? Where are you Galatasaray Hamam is undergoing renovations. [women scream] [Arif] No. There is nothing! No no. There is nothing! There is nothing. [Flame] By Allah, there is nothing. Get out Arif! Get out, get out! But Master Kemal, please! You must believe! Don't do it, Alev, for God's sake. What time travel, what teleportation? Are you riding, my dear? And how can we take you seriously with these bullshit talks? The girl is the end of the world, says the professor. So what did you not understand? Ya Arif Bey, what are we discussing with those clothes you are wearing? Are you also being elitist? What are you looking at my outfit? Focus on what I said, focus on what she said. Besim Toker will disrupt the future by using the robot. -We should do something! -Arif is a very good person. Maybe even better than in the movies. Do not publish the book like this, please. Do not instill despair in people. But my scientific studies do not say so. The book will come out like this, Alev, it's over. The man to be beaten with a full T ruler. What is this? Is this our mentor or is this ours? Is this the man we're talking to? Afakes pressed on me. Isn't there a person to consult, the Ummah of Muhammad? Isn't there a person to talk to? Who are we going to consult? Moon neighbors! Is there anyone? -Who are we going to talk to? -Hop! I am her! [Flame gets scared] Sir Garavel! Sir Garavel! How am I here? -In seconds! -Oh, fuck it! What happened, professor? I see your tongue is open. -Welcome, teacher! -Arif, where are you son? My mind is out. [Garavel koklar] Who is this? Is this the girl? -I'm the flame. -Your mother... Sorry, I'm blind too. Such things happen. He is used to these things, brother. These things are in order. 216 is crazy bro. We have to stop him. -You came, it's over. -What are you saying? Flame, are you ready to be Pink Sugar again? How? We will hit 216 in the heart and Besim where he is most vulnerable. Looking into someone's eyes and loving them Can you say it effectively? For example, look into my eyes and call me Arif. [sexy] Arif. -Well done! -Very nice. That's it. Come on, professor, watch it. How do we rewrite that book? Ads got a lot of attention. İnsanlar gözlerini açmış böyle bekliyorlar. Haftaya çıkıyoruz, değil mi Kâmil? Besim Bey, bu ilk partide robotun kafasını... Kafasını demeyelim...

It was as if their eyes had been opened. What happened? Aren't you glad to see me? Did Arif say? Did he say I sent the money? -Hey. -Where is Arif? Arif left, he didn't say anything to me either. Won't you hug me? -Pembeşeker. -Ali'm. Aa, are we making a photo novel, brother? Wait a minute. This is awesome! Our robot with a human, huh? Pertev, what's going on? Mr. Besim, I love you very much, Mr. Besim. You understand this best. Wonderful. No such thing! From now on, you will live your love to the fullest. In front of everyone. Our robot is having a great love. How big of an ad could this be? can you guess, Pervin? You will be on the front pages and headlines of newspapers. Pertev and his great love. Robots love it too! Now that you know everything, there is no point in hiding it. I'm a robot Pinkcandy. All right, Ali, your pure heart is enough. 216. squeak tsk tsk Pertev.

[Kamil] There are many complaints, Besim Bey. People say it wasn't like what I saw in that ad or something. It was as if we were selling defective goods. Party by party returns. Besim Bey, there is someone who sells to the scrap dealer. And this "Arif Işık disgraced the robot." news. Pertev, come here. Where did we go wrong? Didn't we copy everything from you? It's done and it's empty. I have so many experiences. What should I do if your excellent engineers couldn't do it? Gebertirim art rean. Gebertirim. You will walk like this. Did you understand? like this. You shall not wave your hand or arm in the air. When you do it like this, it becomes very robot-like. Who! Besim Bey, the Germans called. They were coming to Izmir Fair at the weekend. They said that we want the original of the robot. [tense music enters] [emotional music enters] I came to be human. [emotional music continues] [door knocks] [Flame] 216. Go Pinkcandy, I'm ruthless. I'm a stupid robot who doesn't know what to do when. Nobody loves me anymore. Listen to me. I know everything. -You do not know. - Please open the door. You don't know anything, Pinkcandy. Nobody knows anything. I'm dying. [emotional music continues] I'm dying. 216. My battery is running out. Look, one percent. Please do not do it. For forty years I lived happily in Gora. Then there was news everywhere. They said the 216 model will no longer be produced. Spare parts will not be made. I said wow robot, that's it. Then let me go to the world, to Arif, to my friend. I said, "Even though he can't do anything, I can live there like a human for three or five days." But I couldn't tell, so that he wouldn't be upset. I'm dying, Pink Candy. My battery is running out. 216. [emotional music continues] - Pink sugar, I wish you... -Stop, don't talk. -Garavel Teacher! -Ha? I want to have a women's matinee on Wednesdays. What do you say? It's possible. How is the costume? [together] He is worthy. -It didn't happen. -Why, too much belt? -The belt is too much. -Don't do it. Did you see the news? No one else will buy this robot. We finished Besim! [Arif and Garavel laugh] My brother Arif slipped into the margin of the robot so much that this is nothing more, huh. This is more head. [They all laugh together] I'll finish it, did I say I'll finish it! Let him think about Turkish Pop from now on. [They all laugh together] -You're not ashamed, are you? -Oh, Pink Candy, because of the belt? [dramatic music enters] We were supposed to come here and stop the bad guys? Where would the good guys win? Look at you. Dying robot. -It's running out of battery! -What are you saying? How did it end? When does it end? from the beginning. He didn't tell you so you'd be sorry. So that's why he was acting so silly? -Garavel Master? -Let's go and get back, Arif. Besim is going to give the robot to the Germans. Remember, we worked with the Germans first, he said. This means that Pertev Group was established like this. We have to do something, Arif. Wow my brother. 216 die, huh? No, it cannot die. He can't die while I'm here! Okay? No one will die while I'm here, understood? Don't let the robot die bro! Let's plug in my battery if necessary, but that robot doesn't die. [dramatic music continues] Wow my brother. [dramatic music continues] [phone rings] [Flame] Hello. 216? Come to Lovers' Hill at two o'clock. I'm going to tell you the most important thing in my life. -Rosecandy? - I beg you, come. You mean Lovers' Hill, huh? You'll see. Let's move forward as we got it, okay Arif?
