NOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU OR THE TOWN, SO STAND RIGHT UP TO HIM AND TELL HIM, "NO, THANK YOU." ALL RIGHT, WHO TOLD YOU? THERE'S A SPY IN YOUR COMPANY. HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING. WHO IS HE? WHO IS HE? I'D TELL YOU, BUT THEN I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU. NOW, DAD, HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A BUNCH OF MUMBO JUMBO ABOUT PROGRESS AND GROWTH, BUT DON'T BUY IT. STICK TO YOUR GUNS! MOM, CHECK YOUR PIES! OH! MAY I? SURE. DAD LIKES THE STORE JUST THE WAY IT IS, THE WAY IT WAS WHEN GRANDPA STARTED IT. HE LIKES KNOWING HIS CUSTOMERS AND BEING A PART OF THEIR LIVES. THAT'S RIGHT, BILLY. THAT'S SENTIMENTAL HOGWASH. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STUCK HERE IN MAYBERRY AND WE LIVE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THIS IS A WONDERFUL TOWN. WE'RE AGREED! NO VALUEMALL! GREAT! LET'S DO THIS AGAIN NEXT CHRISTMAS. WAIT-- WAIT A SECOND! THIS IS NOT OVER! YEAH, I WAS AFRAID OF THAT. ALL RIGHT, WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST HEAD ON OVER TO THE PAGEANT AND DISCUSS THIS LATER.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. I DID IT. THAT'S EVEN WORSE. YOU PUT YOUR SON UP TO IT. I DIDN'T TELL BILLY TO DO ANYTHING!

MOM, I'M SORRY. THIS IS ALL JEALOUSY. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN JEALOUS OF ME. JEALOUS OF WHAT? MY SUCCESS, OF MY MONEY. YOU CAN'T STAND THE FACT THAT I'VE DONE SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU.

[MAKING KARATE YELPS] TRY YOUR BOGUS KARATE NOW! WHAT GOT INTO YOU TONIGHT, SON? [SIGHS] I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I JUST GOT SICK OF JOEY BULLYING ME AND UNCLE DAVID BULLYING YOU. BULLYING A BULLY ISN'T THE ANSWER. YOU KNOW THAT. YEAH. I TRIED TO STOP UNCLE DAVID, BUT NOTHING WILL. HE'S GOING TO BRING A VALUEMALL HERE, NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO HAWAII AFTER ALL. HE WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW. WE WERE VERY CLOSE ONCE... WHEN WE WERE KIDS. BUT AFTER GRANDPA DIED... I DON'T KNOW. I STAYED. HE LEFT. I GUESS WE JUST GREW APART. HMM. OH, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE SPENDING THE ENTIRE DAY TOMORROW CLEANING OUT THE GARAGE. YOU GOT TO LEARN THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOUR ACTIONS. DAD... WHAT WAS THE FIRST PRESENT YOU EVER GOT MOM? THE FIRST... BOY-- [CHUCKLES] A CUCKOO CLOCK. AND HOW'D YOU KNOW SHE'D LIKE IT? I ASKED HER MOM FIRST. HA! GOOD IDEA. OOPS! I HAD A GOOD IDEA? ARE YOU FEELING OK? YOU HAVE A GIRL YOU WANT TO BUY A GIFT FOR? YEAH, I THINK SO. MMM.... LUCKY GIRL. SHE MUST BE VERY SPECIAL. YEAH. I LIKE THAT. WHAT? SEEING YOU SMILE. [CHUCKLES] HI, BILLY. SARAH... WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD TO LIVE THE SAME CHRISTMAS OVER AND OVER AGAIN? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I'D GET MILLIONS OF PRESENTS, TONS OF CHOCOLATE, NO BEDTIME. I GUESS I'D HAVE THE MOST PERFECT CHRISTMAS IN THE WHOLE WORLD. THAT'S IT! SARAH, YOU'RE A GENIUS! REALLY? YEAH! THAT'S THE ANSWER! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE MOST PERFECT CHRISTMAS IN THE WORLD. Radio Announcer: IT'S 7 A.M. ON YOUR NUMBER ONE MUSIC STATION IN GREENWOOD FALLS. Sarah: SANTA CAME! SANTA CAME! CORRECTION. SANTA'S HERE.

HA HA HA! LOOK. OH, HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY. HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY. THAT OUGHT TO KEEP HIM FROM FEELING LONELY. [CAR HORN HONKS] HERE WE GO. [CRASH] THANKS A LOT FOR COMING SO FAST. BETTER JUST TOW THEM RIGHT BACK TO THE SHOP AND GET THEM UNTANGLED THERE AND BRING THEM BACK LATER FOR DINNER. Driver: SURE THING. [METAL SCRAPING] NOW WE CAN HAVE THE PERFECT DAY.

SLAP LEATHER, PARTNER. [GUNSHOT] Woman: HELLO? UH, HI. THIS IS BILLY JACKSON. UM, IS THIS DIANE'S MOTHER? HI. UM...CAN I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? WHOSE CAR IS THAT? IT'S MY UNCLE DAVID'S. AND HE JUST HANDED YOU THE KEYS? WELL, HE LEFT THEM IN THE IGNITION, WHICH IS PRACTICALLY AN INVITATION. AND YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU. IT WOULD TOP OFF THE MOST PERFECT DAY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. THERE'S NOTHING TO IT. I'VE BEEN WATCHING MY DAD FOR YEARS. Mr. McGregor: OK, QUIET, EVERYBODY. QUIET. THE WINNER OF THE JELLYBEAN CONTEST WITH A GUESS OF 2,450 IS BILLY JACKSON. [APPLAUSE] CONGRATULATIONS. Boy: A VERY LUCKY GUESS. YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ME IN THE FIRST GRADE. YES, I DID. YOU HAD MRS. LUCKY, AND YOU SAT IN THE FRONT ROW BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T SEE VERY WELL, AND YOU WORE LITTLE ROUND GLASSES, BUT YOU HATED THEM, AND THEN YOU GOT CONTACTS IN THE FIFTH GRADE WHICH TURNED YOUR EYES INTO A BEAUTIFUL SHADE OF BLUE. THEY MAKE YOU BLINK MORE, BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO MIND. BILLY, HOW DID YOU FIND THIS OUT? I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. OH, HERE. I GOT YOU A PRESENT. A PRESENT FOR ME? JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING. A BRACELET WITH MY NAME ON IT? I LOVE IT. IT'S JUST LIKE THE ONE MY DAD GAVE ME THAT I LOST AT SCHOOL. I JUST THOUGHT IT'D MAKE YOU HAPPY. HEY! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? WELL, I JUST CAME TO TOP OFF THE MOST PERFECT DAY OF MY LIFE AND TO GIVE DIANE A GIFT. YOU GAVE DIANE A GIFT? NOT A SMART IDEA. Boys: WHOA! [AS ROBERT DeNIRO] YOU TALKIN' TO ME? 'CAUSE, UH... I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE AROUND HERE. ARE YOU TALKING TO ME? HA HA HA! HA HA HA! HE'S MINE! YOU'RE DEAD! [AS CLINT EASTWOOD] GO AHEAD. MAKE MY DAY. AWAAAH! [THUD] OH. MY GOODNESS. [AS JOHN WAYNE] COME ON, PILGRIM. LET'S TANGLE. YOU'RE TOO CRAZY TO FIGHT. SWEET DREAMS, PILGRIM. [APPLAUSE] EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. OH, SORRY ABOUT THE RUCKUS, SIR. UH... THIS SHOULD COVER ALL MY FRIENDS. COME ON. WE'RE OUT OF HERE. WHAT? YOU AND ME, BABE. WE'RE SPLITTING. WHY? BECAUSE I SAID SO. YOU'RE KIDDING. [AS HUMPHREY BOGART] I NEVER KID, DOLL. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT, BUT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE EXACTLY LIKE JOEY. YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY, BUT YOU'RE REALLY JUST A JERK. MRS. PATRICK'S DELIVERY! [CAT MEOWS] [CATS MEOWING] IS THAT GOOD? AHEM. I WOULD THINK VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE SPEAKING, YOUNG MAN. THE KEYS TO MY CAR. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME. YOU NEVER DO. TRY ME. OK. I WATCHED THE BULLETS GAME, AND THEN I TOOK UNCLE DAVID'S CAR, WHICH I RECENTLY LEARNED HOW TO DRIVE, AND I WENT FOR A JOYRIDE. OH, BILLY, THIS JUST ISN'T LIKE YOU. NOT EVEN THAT YOU'VE DONE SO MANY THINGS WRONG, BUT THAT YOU WOULD RUIN CHRISTMAS FOR YOUR SISTER AND YOUR COUSIN AND FOR US. I'M SORRY, MOM. SORRY ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT. YOU'RE GROUNDED. YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER. HE'S LUCKY. FINE. NO SCRATCHES. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FOOLING YOURSELF IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW YOUR KIDS. PROBABLY IN A GANG. Caroline: OH, DAVID. BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU HAVE BEEN TOO HARD ON HIM. DAVID TOLD ME ABOUT THE TIME THE 2 OF YOU SNEAKED OFF TO SEE THE STONES CONCERT. WEREN'T YOU ABOUT BILLY'S AGE? WELL, THAT WAS DIFFERENT. WHY, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET CAUGHT? DAVID TOLD ME THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTS OF HIS LIFE. HE HAS TO KNOW THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR HIS ACTIONS. WELL, OF COURSE, BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS. CAN'T YOU PUNISH HIM ANOTHER DAY? IT DOESN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT! IT'S REALLY NOT HIS FAULT ANYWAY. WHAT? IF YOU MADE SOME REAL MONEY, YOU COULD SEND HIM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL JUST LIKE OUR KIDS. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD... THAT'S WHERE VALUEMALL COMES INTO THE PICTURE. Henry: IF I HEAR ONE MORE WORD ABOUT THAT MONSTER STORE OF YOURS, I'M GOING TO THROW-- MONEY'S NOT EVERYTHING, DAVE! I KNOW. IT'S ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR HOME. THOSE ARE WHAT ARE IMPORTANT. YEAH! WELL, YOUR HOUSE IS FALLING APART. YOUR WIFE BURNS THINGS. YOUR DAUGHTER'S AFRAID OF HER OWN SHADOW. YOUR SON IS PRACTICALLY A JUVENILE DELINQUENT. ONE TIME-- AT LEAST I SPEND TIME WITH MY FAMILY. I'M HOME. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE HOW TO LIVE. YOU'RE HOPELESS! WORKING 18 HOURS A DAY AND NEVER SEEING YOUR FAMILY IS NOT MY IDEA OF MAKING A LIVING. I KNEW THIS WAS A MISTAKE. I KNEW YOU'D NEVER APPRECIATE WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST TRY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. CAROLINE, GET JACEY. WE'RE OUT OF HERE. IF WE HURRY, WE CAN BE IN HAWAII BY MORNING. JACEY! WE'RE GOING TO HAWAII! YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY... Dave: I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BRING A VALUEMALL TO GREENWOOD FALLS. THIS IS MY HOMETOWN, TOO, AND IF I WANT TO COME BACK HOME, I WILL! YOU WANT TO MOVE BACK HERE? WELL, NOT NOW. NOW JUST THE STORE, AND THEN, WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS. FINE, AND IF I WANT TO JOIN THE COMMUNITY TO TRY TO STOP YOU, THEN...FINE! FINE! FINE! FINE! FINE! Caroline: MERRY CHRISTMAS. FINE! FINE! HA! FINE! FINE! FINE! FINE! FINE! FINE. DAD... I'M SORRY. I NEVER MEANT TO-- IT WAS MY FAULT. I LOST MY TEMPER. DON'T GET ME WRONG, YOU'RE STILL GROUNDED FOR LIFE, BUT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN MY BROTHER AND I WAS...MY BROTHER AND I. I COULD TELL YOU EVERYTHING WILL BE OK TOMORROW, BUT YOU'D NEVER BELIEVE ME. EVEN IF THINGS DO LOOK BETTER IN THE MORNING, BILLY, YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO LEARN FROM TODAY, TRY NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES. I SAW THE OLD LADY, DAD-- MRS. PATRICK. THE DELIVERY FROM CHRISTMAS EVE. SHE WAS EATING CAT FOOD. IF I HAD DELIVERED THE TUNA-- SHE WON'T BUY THE TUNA BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. SHE'S GOT TO EAT, SHE'S GOT TO FEED HER CATS, SO I CHANGED THE LABELS. I PUT THE CAT FOOD ON THE TUNA. I'D GIVE IT TO HER, BUT SHE'S TOO PROUD. SHE WON'T ACCEPT ANY CHARITY. THEN WHEN I DELIVER IT TO HER, WELL, I TELL HER THAT I'LL SEND HER THE BILL, BUT I DON'T, AND SHE FORGETS. WHOA! SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD CUSTOMER, AND A GOOD FRIEND. YEAH, BUT SHE DOESN'T BUY ANYTHING. WELL, YOU CAN'T BUY FRIENDSHIP, BILLY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON SOMEONE FOR THEM TO BE YOUR FRIEND. GOOD NIGHT, SON. MERRY CHRISTMAS. WHAT'S WRONG, BILLY? WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE MOM AND DAD. I KNOW. NO. SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING, SARAH, EVEN ON CHRISTMAS. I MEAN, MOM AND DAD... MAN, THEY GIVE US SO MUCH. MOM AND DAD HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE, TOO. WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING, TOO. WHAT CAN WE DO? WE'RE JUST KIDS. GOOD NIGHT. Radio: WELL, IT'S 11 P.M. CHRISTMAS NIGHT. IT WASN'T A MERRY CHRISTMAS AT THE FERGUSON HOME ON CHESTER STREET. AROUND 10:00 THIS MORNING, A FIRE SPARKED BY A DRY CHRISTMAS TREE DESTROYED THE FAMILY HOME AND EVERYTHING INSIDE IT. Woman: AND EARLY THIS CHRISTMAS MORNING, A YOUNG UNIDENTIFIED BOY BROKE INTO THE FERGUSON HOME AND, USING A FIRE EXTINGUISHER HE JUST HAPPENED TO BE CARRYING, EXTINGUISHED A BURNING CHRISTMAS TREE BEFORE IT HAD TIME TO CAUSE ANY DAMAGE TO THE HOME. THIS STORY GOES TO PROVE THAT THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT IS ALIVE AND WELL IN GREENWOOD FALLS. I'M KENDALL CASEY REPORTING. EXCUSE ME, YOUNG LADY, HOW DID YOU FINALLY FIND YOUR WAY OUT OF THE FOREST? I DON'T KNOW. WE WERE HUDDLED TOGETHER CRYING, HOPING SOMEONE WOULD FIND US, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS BOY COMES WALKING UP TO US AND TELLS US TO FOLLOW HIM. HE GAVE US ALL HOMEMADE CHRISTMAS COOKIES. HELLO? HELLO? ANYBODY HERE? HELLO? OH, MY GOODNESS. GOODNESS GRACIOUS. Radio: AND THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS IN AND AROUND GREENWOOD FALLS TODAY, BUT CHRISTMAS 1996 WAS STILL FULL OF TRAGEDY. THE WAVERLY NURSING HOME WAS FLOODED EARLY THIS MORNING, AND THE-- [SHUTS RADIO OFF] WHAT'S WRONG, BILLY? YOU CAN'T FIX THE WORLD. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY OR WHAT YOU DO, YOU CAN'T FIX EVERYTHING. MORE BAD STUFF KEEPS ON HAPPENING. TALK TO ME, HENRY. I CAN'T. WELL, I SURE WISH YOU WOULD BECAUSE WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. IF HE BRINGS THE STORE HERE, THEN WE CAN'T SURVIVE. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR? THEN TALK TO HIM. TELL HIM HOW MUCH KEEPING THE STORE MEANS TO US. I DID. NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU TOLD HIM HOW MUCH IT WOULD MEAN TO THE COMMUNITY, BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM-- DO YOU WANT ME TO BEG? DO YOU WANT ME TO BEG MY LITTLE BROTHER TO LET ME KEEP MY STORE? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO, MOLLY. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? DO YOU WANT TO MOVE? DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS TOWN WHERE WE GREW UP AND THIS HOUSE WHERE BILLY AND SARAH WERE BORN JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO PROUD TO TALK TO YOUR LITTLE BROTHER? THAT IS SO UNFAIR. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE, HENRY. I'M NOT LEAVING. THEN STAY. HEY, DAD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP, BILLY? COULDN'T SLEEP. I WISH I COULD FIX THINGS, DAD. YOU KNOW, LIKE THE STORE AND YOU AND MOM. THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB, BILLY. YOUR JOB IS TO BE 13. BE THE BEST 13 YOU CAN BE. I'LL WORK ON THE OTHER STUFF, OK? YEAH, BUT DOESN'T IT EVER BOTHER YOU THAT YOU JUST CAN'T FIX EVERYTHING? NO. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT SOME ADVICE I GOT FROM ONE OF THE SMARTEST MEN I EVER KNEW, MY DAD. HE SAID LOVE YOUR FAMILY AND LOVE YOUR FRIENDS. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, STEP OUTSIDE YOURSELF SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU CARE ABOUT, AND DO YOUR BEST EVERY DAY, AND LIFE WILL FALL INTO PLACE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THOSE THINGS I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT. I JUST HAVE TO LOVE AND PROTECT MY FAMILY THE BEST I CAN. YOUR MOM AND YOUR SISTER AND YOU, YOU'RE MY LIFE. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I WOULDN'T DO TO PROTECT YOU. YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT UNCLE DAVID? WELL, IF UNCLE DAVE WANTS TO BRING HIS STORE HERE, THERE MAY NOT BE MUCH I CAN DO ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT DISAPPOINTS YOU... BUT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE HAS TO DO. NO. I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED IN YOU. I LOVE YOU, DAD. I LOVE YOU, TOO, SON. AND RIGHT NOW, I GOT TO GO TALK TO YOUR MOM. Radio Announcer: IT'S 7 A.M. ON YOUR NUMBER ONE MUSIC STATION IN GREENWOOD FALLS. [GROANS] Sarah: SANTA CAME! SANTA CAME! Molly: OF COURSE HE DID. OH, WHAT COULD IT BE? LET ME HELP. LET ME HELP. LET ME HELP. MERRY CHRISTMAS. OH, LOOK WHAT SANTA BROUGHT! HEY. MERRY CHRISTMAS. LOOK WHAT SANTA BROUGHT. WHAT A COOL PRESENT, SARAH. THAT'S COOL. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU STILL LIKED DOLLS. DON'T BE IN A HURRY TO GROW UP. WHAT DID YOU GET, DAD? WHAT DID YOU GET, MOM? OH, WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT-- THIS... HMM... OH, A BOOK ON IRELAND! OH, HONEY, THESE PAINTS ARE GORGEOUS. THANKS. THANK YOU. WELL, I MISS WATCHING YOU PAINT. YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM IS A WONDERFUL ARTIST. I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO THERE SOMEDAY. AS LONG AS I CAN TAKE YOU, TOO. CAN I TAKE THESE PAINTS? MM-HMM. Billy: OH, AND I GOT A BASKETBALL, WHICH IS JUST WHAT I WANTED. I'M NOT THAT GOOD, BUT IF I PRACTICE, I'LL GET BETTER. ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS JUST KEEP ON OPENING YOUR PRESENTS, AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. LET'S SEE. AH, IT'S TO YOU. IT'S TO ME? OH... WHO'S IT FROM? WELL... OH, HONEY. [DING, CUCKOO] YOUR DAD AND YOUR UNCLE DAVID, THEY USED TO DELIVER MY GROCERIES WHEN THEY WERE KIDS. MY DAD AND UNCLE DAVID USED TO WORK TOGETHER? THEY SURE DID, RIGHT UP UNTIL YOUR GRANDPA DIED. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T REALLY KNOW. I GUESS THEY, UH... [CAR HORN HONKS] I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, MR. CHARMERS. IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO YOU. OH... HEY, BILLY. AMAZING CAR, UNCLE DAVID. MUST HAVE HAD TO WORK HARD FOR A CAR LIKE THAT. HOW MANY HOURS A DAY WOULD YOU SAY YOU PUT IN? MORE THAN I CAN COUNT, BILLY. MORE THAN I CAN COUNT. COME ON, JACE. OUT OF THE CAR. WE'RE HERE. GLAD YOU COULD COME, AUNT CAROLINE. I KNOW IT'S NOT HAWAII, BUT MY MOM'S A GREAT COOK, AND OUR FAMILIES DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER. WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, BILLY. MERRY CHRISTMAS. HI, JACE. MERRY CHRISTMAS, BILLY. WELL, IT IS CERTAINLY NOT LIKE I SIT AROUND EATING BONBONS ALL DAY. NO. I DRIVE JACEY TO DANCE CLASS AND TO TUTORS, AND I DO CHARITY WORK. YEAH, BUT STILL I CAN SEE HOW YOU'D WANT MORE. WELL, I DID LOVE WORKING. MAKING MY OWN MONEY MADE ME FEEL REALLY SECURE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO IT. OH, YOUR UNCLE DAVID WOULD NEVER HEAR OF THAT. OH... GIN. IT TAKES 3 THINGS TO PLAY BASKETBALL. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE-- AND YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, DAD. OK. NOW TAKE A SHOT. GOOD TRY, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TUCK IN YOUR ELBOW. LOOK... YOU LOOK AT THE BALL. LOOK AT THE HOOP. LOOK BACK AT THE BALL. CLOSE YOUR EYES. PICTURE THE BALL GOING IN. TRY IT AGAIN. THAT WAS A GOOD EFFORT, SON. OK. TRY IT AGAIN. I COULD GET ONE OF MY OLD BIKES OUT IF YOU WANT TO RIDE WITH SARAH. NO, THANKS. YOU CAN'T EXACTLY RIDE A BIKE IN CLOTHES LIKE THESE. SO YOU CAN BORROW SOME JEANS AND A T-SHIRT FROM ME. I ONLY WEAR DESIGNER JEANS. THOSE OTHER JEANS MAKE ME DIZZY. SO BORROW SOME SHORTS. IT'S TOO COLD! CAN'T RIDE A 2-WHEELER, CAN YOU? MY DAD SAID HE WOULD TEACH ME. HE GOT BUSY. I COULD TEACH YOU. OK. COME ON. DON'T LET GO. I WON'T. DON'T LET GO! I'M NOT. I WON'T. HEY, JACEY! I'M DOING IT! I'M RIDING ALONE! BILLY, SARAH, LOOK, I'M RIDING ALONE! EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR A BRACELET.
