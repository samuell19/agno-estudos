Help! Let me go! Don't mess with me. Don't you try to mess with me. Please let me go. Hey! Please..... The people of Kampung Paya Datuk, Malacca were shocked... ...by a discovery of a body... ...that was found shoved inside a cement barrel. The victim,... ...Seth Mohd Adam Bin Seth Abdul Ghani... ...was believed died from... -No! ...multiple stab in his back..... -I'm not dead yet! What's this? I'm not dead yet! Help! Help me! I'm here. I'm not dead yet! Help! Hello. Help! Oh, God. Why does this happen? Why? Hello... Help! Anyone outside? Help me! Please open the door. Help! Access denied. Access denied. Help! Hello. Emergency line 999. How can we help you? Hello? Hello, miss. Please help me. I'm trapped inside a room. I don't know where I'm at. Hello? Emergency line 999. Can we help you? Yes, I hear you. Please listen to me. I was kidnapped. Now I'm locked inside a room. I don't know where I am. In the news, they reported that I was dead. I'm not dead. I'm still alive. My name is Seth Mohd Adam. I'm still alive. Sir? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello! I can't hear you. Hello! Can you hear me? Hello! Hello! Can you hear my voice? I'm locked..... Hello! Hello? -Hello. Who is this? I'm Adam. -Adam? Yes, it's me, Adam. Who is that? I was told to call this number... ...if I need the EMP-47 location. But no one answered since earlier. I know. I was handcuffed earlier. I'm locked inside a room..... I'm not sure where I'm at... ...but it looks like an interrogation room. Wait. Are you sure you're inside an interrogation room? Okay, then which police station are you at right now? I don't know except that this room looks like an interrogation room. I don't know what is this place. -Wait. What's your name again? Adam. Seth Mohammad Adam. -Bin Seth Abdul Ghani? Yes, that's me. Seth Mohd Adam is on the line. Our suspect is on the line. Please get me his location. Move now, move! Suspect? Suspect of what? Sir? Hello! Hello? Mr Adam, I'm Inspector Azizul from the Counter-Terrorism Unit. My team is trying to locate you now. But before that, may I know what happened actually? Who locked you up? Can you please explain to me what happened... ...before you were locked up? I need the information to help you, Adam. I can't think of anything. My head is spinning. My head hurt. Our team is trying to trace your location now. Please give us some time. I would like to know if the chip is with you right now. Chip? What chip? The EMP-47 chip! What's that? What's happening? Enough! I don't get it. Hey! Hello, sir. Listen to me. I don't know. I don't know how I ended up here... ...why and who took me here. I don't know any of that. What I know now is I want you to take me out of here. Please understand my current situation, will you? Adam, listen here. Earlier this evening, Kembara Merdeka Convoy was bombed. Did you know, Minister of Home Affairs,... ...Dato' Seri Kamarul Hussein is among the casualties? So, what does it have to do with me? What does it have to do with me? -What does it have to do with you? You sabotaged the event and blew them up. Have you forgotten? Don't try to pull my leg. I don't have the time to entertain you. What does it have anything to do with me? I don't get it. I know nothing about the bomb. What's my motive for doing that? What are you talking about? When I caught you earlier,... ...you admitted that you blew the Kembara Merdeka Convoy... ...and killed Dato' Seri Kamarul Hussein Now you try to turn this around? You said you caught me. Then why I'm here? -Did you just ask me that? My team was attacked by The Eastern Army... ...on our way to take you to Bukit Aman Police Headquarters. They attacked the police to save you. Wait. The Eastern Army? The terrorist group? Why are they trying to save me? Because you're part of them. Come on, Adam. Wasn't it you who smuggled in the EMP-47 chip... ...from Malacca last week? Have you forgotten what happened in Malacca, Adam? Malacca? What Malacca? I don't get it. What happened in Malacca? Help! Did you know, because of people like you, others look down on us? Let him go. Piss off! It's fine. Hey, wait! Here, take it. Don't rob anyone. -Sorry, sir. You're embarrassing. Why did you give him money? Did you know, people like you... ...can be easily manipulated if you keep doing that? Thank you. Hamzah! You're Hamzah, right? Hamzah, Melawati High School. We were classmates from form one until form three. It's me, Adam. Seth Mohd Adam. Who? -Seth Mohd Adam. Seth Mohd Adam? Seth Mohd Adam..... Adam! It has been a while! Hey, you look different now. How are you? What are you doing here? I have some work here. I do hotel reviews. Visit the tourist attraction. And my camera almost got robbed. I can't work without it. Eva! Dear, what took you so long? I want to introduce you to someone. This is my friend, Adam. Is she your girlfriend? I guess he will be joining our vacation. I'm Eva. -Adam. Eva! Hamzah! Review..... Okay, I remember now. I went to Malacca to review some hotels. That's my job. -If you're telling the truth,... ...can you tell me how did you come back to KL... ...with the EMP-47 chip? Sir, please. Listen to me. I don't know anything. I don't anything about the chip or the bomb. Please let me go. My head hurt so much. Please, I can't think straight. I want to help you, but you have to understand my situation now. It's you who should understand my situation now! Get it? Sir, listen here. I'll repeat myself again. I don't know anything about the chip or the bomb. I don't know anything at all. Please listen to me. I just want to know how to get out of here. I will take an oath on the Quran. I don't know anything. Please. We will rescue you, Adam. But first, tell us the EMP-47 chip location. Go to hell! EMP-47..... "HE'S NOT HIM" Hello? -Are you ready to cooperate? Whose body is in this drawer? -Body? Stop pretending. And don't pretend as if someone... ...gave you the information to call this number. It was you who trapped me here and murdered this man, right? Do you think I'm stupid? Open the door now, you bastard! Bastard? After we went through all the troubles... ...saving you from the police, now you call us bastard? You..... Are you the Eastern Army? Why did you rescue me? I'm not a part of you. Because you took something that belongs to us. Why did you lock me up? What do you want from me? The EMP-47 chip. So, it's true that you locked me up... ...and killed this man. Why did you kill him? Those are none of your concern, Adam. What's important now is if you don't want to end up like him,... ...give us the location of the chip. Hey, Adam! Even the police don't know of your location. Even after you died and turned into a corpse... ...no one can find you. Did you see the timer on the wall? Look at it carefully. I see it. What did you see? 9850. Ninety-eight minutes. Boom! That's how much time you have... ...before that room blew up into pieces. Okay, here. I have the chip with me. Open the door first. Open the door. What? Do you think we're stupid? Before we locked you there... ...we checked your body. I'm asking you for the last time. Where is my EMP-47 chip? Why do you want that chip that badly? So, you don't want to tell us where is the chip, right? Do you have a death wish, Adam? Do you want to feel the taste of death? Okay. I hope it's worth it, Adam. Hello? I asked you, have you been doing hotel reviews for a while? No, I'm still new to it. I'm doing it on a part-time basis. I need some extra cash. Part-time? So what is your full-time job? I'm the Head of Human Resources... ...at a paper company, Jaya Pearl Berhad. Have you heard of it? -No, never. So, does that mean your company cut down... ...all trees in Malaysia and turn the forest into a wasteland? No, you can't say that. Why can't I? That's a fact. The nature destroyer. Who cares about trees? No one cares about it. People care more about papers for them to write on,... ...tissue to wipe their mouths and boxes to pack their stuff. They only care about that. Some love recycling, like me. In this way, we can help to save nature. This fish and chip. The fish is caught in the sea. It's considered nature too, right? Can we recycle it? Of course, no. What I mean is..... We have to sacrifice something to gain something. It's just the way it is. I like that. "We have to sacrifice something to gain something." Very wise. How about you? What is your job? Recycling company? -No! Adam, I don't know how to say it. I can't keep living like this. It's miserable. I don't have money and always need to check the price tag. Yet I still can't buy it because I can't afford it. I don't like living like this. If I have money, I can do a lot of things. Men are tested with women. Women are tested with luxury. I don't get it. If you want to change your life, you can't wait. You should go and chase after what you want. You need to be more aggressive and competitive. The world won't stop and wait for you. Do you get it? Adam, are you sure you're staying at the hotel? Eva, follow him back. I have something to do. Dear, you're always..... Hello? This is the emergency line 999. We received a call earlier... ...from this number. We suspected that..... -Yes, I called you earlier. I am locked inside a room... ...but I don't know where. They told me... ...I blew up the Kembara Merdeka Convoy. I killed Dato' Seri Kamarul Hussein... ...but it wasn't me. I'm not guilty. I'm innocent. -Do you think it's funny? This is an emergency line. Don't joke around. Dato' Seri is still alive and is giving his speech live. What do you mean he was murdered? Are you in trouble or not? Listen. I'm locked inside a room for no reason. I don't know where am I. I don't know my location now. Are you sure it's for no reason? Maybe you sleep with someone's wife or something. Think carefully. Did you know who locked you up? The Eastern Army! I'm sure it's them. What? The Eastern Army? Do you mean the terrorist group? Are you sure? Give me your full name for me to check. You can't take this lightly. Okay. My name is Seth Mohd Adam bin Seth Abdul Ghani. Seth Mohd Adam? Wait on the line. I'll check. Don't take too long. Please. Sir? -Hello! Yes. How was it? Do you think this is funny? It's not, at all! Did you know you can be alleged of making fake phone calls? What do you mean? -I've checked it. Seth Mohd Adam bin Seth Abdul Ghani... ...was found dead yesterday evening. No, that's me. I'm still alive. I'm still alive now. It's me who's talking. I'm Seth Mohd Adam. It's me. Please. Hello? This is my final warning. If you called again after this,... ...I will make sure you are jailed. Do you think we don't have anything else to do? Checking this and that for nothing. Hello! Hey! Do you think you can keep me here forever? Sure. Wait. Wait a moment. Thank you. -Thank you too. That's a lot. You don't have small change? It's nothing. I'm just saying. They still have their hands and legs. No, it's not that. Actually, I have a brother. His name is Hairie. He has autism too. My parents took care of him before. After they passed away,... ...I take over the responsibility to take care of him. Sorry, I didn't know that. Here, for you. -For me? It's pretty. From that boy. You can use it to keep your stuff. You're very kind. You should be proud of yourself, Adam. Not everyone can do what you're doing. There's nothing to be proud of. It's my responsibility. I believe if Hairie was in my place... ...he would do the same. Don't be so sure. Hello. Can I order pizzas? I want to order 13 boxes of pizza. Can you give me eight pieces of garlic bread? Yes, eight pieces. Mushroom soup? No, it's okay. I don't want it. And give me two plates of noodles,... ...with fried rice topped with a sunny-side-up egg. Wait. And beef stuffed pancakes. Drinks? A moment. Hey, do you want drinks? I'm taking the order. Quick! Hey, I want to order drinks now. Are you dead? I want iced lemon tea. Make it sweet. I'm very thirsty. Okay? Do you remember my order? Address? Wait. Address...... Where am I? Don't ask me a stupid question. Just send it over. Bye! Hello! Hey, Eva! I'm not doing anything. I'm resting. Where are you? No, I don't mind. I'm not busy like Hamzah. I don't mind. Sure! Do you want to meet? Okay, I'll be there. Wait for me. Okay, good bye. Eva wants to see me. Hey! Eva wants to see me. How to open this door? Please open the door. Hey, I'm meeting Eva! Open the door. How to unlock it? Hey! Anyone outside? Hey! How to unlock the door? You don't know it either? What buttons are these? Hey! Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Come and hang out in my room first. Someone might see us. That's inappropriate. Does that mean it will be fine if no one sees us? You shouldn't leave a woman in her room alone. No, it's not that. It might look bad if someone sees us. What about Hamzah? What would he think? Why? Are you trying to do anything to me... ...that you're afraid Hamzah sees us? Just sit here. I've told you about my life. Tell me about yours. Nothing is interesting. Just a homeless girl trying to change her life. Stuck in this cruel and miserable life. Are you homeless? But you look like a well-educated person. We have our ways... ...to hide our past, right? I can't be telling everyone that I'm an ex-convict daughter... ...who was raised by her mother who is a stripper. How did you turn your life around? Imagine it, Adam. A fatherless seven years old little girl. Every night I saw different men... ...come in and leave my mother's room. Five years later, she wants me to follow in her footsteps. I was 12. Twelve years old. But I was lucky because not long after that... ...the Welfare Department came and took me... ...and sent me... ...to Christian Orphanage School. Imagine it, Adam. I only learned how to spell when I was 12. But I really want to learn. I mean..... I know only through education I can change my life. I want a better life. I left on my 18th birthday. I want to start a new life, a new adventure. But again, I ended up homeless on the street. Why it seems fate hates seeing me happy? Anyways..... Then, a guy found me. Or I met this guy. And he introduced me to this organization. An organization..... Through this organization, I got a house,... ...I have a job and my life starts to change. I thought I have fallen in love with the man who saved me. But in the end, he and the organization... ...are only using me for their benefit. They used you? What do you mean? There's no easy way to say it. Let's just say my life would've been better... ...if I followed in my mom's footsteps. Was it that bad? Yes, but I'm glad now. I finally meet a man who will appreciate me. A man who will save me... ...from this cruel and miserable life. A man who will pamper me with his touch,... ...his words,... ...his love. -Do you mean Hamzah? No, Adam. Not him. Wait. How about Hamzah? Don't..... I don't need him tonight. Hello? -Listen to me, sir. Be honest with me. Are you really in an emergency... ...or you're pranking us with this fake call? Did you know that today is my first day here? Everyone here is mocking me... ...because I panicked with your fake calls. Do you think I don't have anything better to do? Wait for a second. Who is this? -Why did you ask me? It was you who frantically asked me to help you. I'm from the emergency line 999. Is it true that you're Seth Mohd Adam? I don't get it. Seth Mohd Adam is dead. I just watched the news that..... No, listen here. I'm still alive. I'm trapped in a room. Please save me. I have less than an hour before..... I call you again because I want to help. But if you lied to me I will look for you until I found you. Don't mess with me. I have the access... ...to everyone's Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Tumblr. Lie to me if you dare. No, I'm not lying. It's true, I'm trapped. Please. I need to leave quickly. If not, this room will explode. Are you sure the Eastern Army locked you up? I don't know. They want a bomb chip from me. It's not with me. I don't know it. The chip is with Hamzah. Yes! Hamzah. Hello? Don't be quiet. That's the prayer call. Be quiet for a while. Unless you want to die without reciting the shahada. Hello? Can you help me or not? Please help me! This case is too heavy. I think it's out of my job scope. Terrorism and militants are serious issues. So, I think..... -This is your job! I'm in an emergency, okay? I'm in an emergency. I could be killed anytime. There's already one dead body here. Do you want to wait until I die before you help me? But the problem is no one believes you! But you believe me. Yes, I do but the issue here is..... Enough! I'll call you back. Don't hang up! Hello! Hairie! Hey, that's my brother! Let him go! Please! He's not well. Hairie! Hairie! Please! Please don't do anything to him. Please! Hairie! Hello! -Choose, Adam. Please let him go. EMP-47 or your brother? Please give me some time. Please let go of my brother. Where is it? How much longer do you want to keep me waiting? Please let him go. I don't have the chip with me. It's with Hamzah. Yes, it was with Hamzah. But you ran away with it after you killed him! Why would I kill him? He's my friend. Why would I kill him? Because Hamzah planned to give the chip to the police. You disagree because your initial plan was... ...to sell the chip to us. Ninety million ringgit, Adam. Who won't kill their friend for such an amount? Tell me. In front of my eyes, Adam. You betrayed your friend and took the chip from him. No, I won't do that. I'm not a murderer. I won't kill my friend. No! You're a murderer. Listen to me, Adam. I will give you ten seconds before I blast your brother's head. That's what you want, right? Do it. If you do that,... ...you won't get anything from me. Go to hell! Do it! Eight, seven, six..... -Okay! Please. Don't hurt him. Please let him go. Please. I promise you, please. Four..... Three, two..... -No! Hairie! Hairie..... Hairie..... It's Hamzah. Hello, Hamzah. No, I'm sleeping. Eva? No, she's not here. I thought she was with you. Do you need to see me? Wait. Now? Wait there. I'll come to you. What even is that? Hey! You hit me like a woman! Do you want to be beaten to death, Hamzah? Where is that chip? Inside your mom's dress. Do you think we care if you died? Where is EMP-47? If the chip falls into your hand,... ...it will only bring disaster! Disaster for the enemies of Islam! That's our jihad. -Jihad? Jihad that will only cost millions of human lives? Do you want to be one of the victims? Who is it? Try me! Come! Do you think I'm scared? You used to be my hope in the Eastern Army But, too bad... ...tonight you will die in vain. Betrayer! Hey! Hey! I'm not here looking for trouble. I want Hamzah. Give Hamzah to me before I shot him. Do you want me to shoot you? Or do you want me to shoot him first? Who is that? You shouldn't interfere... ...in this matter, you fool! Hey, dumbass! If I didn't interfere you would've died! I don't get it. Why would you get in the way? Now they know your face! You won't live long. They will look for you. They will look for you until they found you, Adam. Tell me what do you have... ...that makes him almost kill you? Adam, there are things in this world... ...that you should not know. Hey, listen to me. If I know about it... ...I'll just leave you to die. Okay? That's what I want! -Don't be nonsense. Now tell me what do you have... ...that he almost killed you? Who are you actually? Adam that I know... ...can't fight like that. You were amazing back then. Who are you? Who are you, Adam? Hit him, Adam! Hit him! Khalif? Captain Khalif? Are you okay, captain? -Who is this? Captain Khalif, this is me, Major Dzulkarnain... ...from the Royal Intelligence Corps. Major Dzulkarnain? Where are you, Captain Khalif? You've been missing from the radar for almost 36 hours. What happened to your mission? Our unit tries to trace you but..... What? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I don't get it. The last time we heard from you... ...you said you have the EMP-47 chip with you. Is that right? What happened to Imam Muljam? Who killed him? What happened actually? What nonsense is this? Come on, captain. It's me, Major Dzulkarnain. I just want to know what happened to our mission. What mission are you talking about? Our mission is to trace Hamzah Omar... ...and take the EMP-47 from him. Have you forgotten? Look, Khalif. I need an answer. Adam! My name is Adam. Don't you know? Seth Mohd Adam! Not Khalif! Don't mess with my head, can you? What? So it's true. What do you mean? Look, Khalif. Focus. Listen to my explanation, okay? It seems that you're confused now. Right! I am confused! I'm confused. I don't understand anything. Khalif, listen. Adam is not your real name. Seth Mohd Adam is dead and his body was found... ...yesterday evening. It was all over the news. What do you mean? Khalif, you're the captain of a special force unit... ...under the Royal Intelligence Corps. Khalif, try to remember. Five months ago. The government and Interpol have assigned us... ...to gather and analyze the information... ...about Hamzah Omar, a member of the Eastern Army... ...who stole the EMP-47 chip... ...and murdered four agents from India. He planned to sell the chip to Russia. Exactly seven weeks ago... ...you received intel that Hamzah Omar... ...was hiding in Malacca. He will meet with the military officers from China... ...who is interested to buy the EMP-47 chip. So, I'm not Adam? Who is Adam? Adam is our collateral damage. To accomplish this mission,... ...you need to disguise yourself as Hamzah's friend. Among all his friends,... ...Seth Mohd Adam is the most suitable candidate. His physical identity is 80 percent... ...similar to yours, Khalif. And to our advantage, we know that... ...Hamzah and Adam haven't met each other for 15 years. So now I took Adam's identity? You did your research on Adam for almost a month. So that when you two met, Hamzah will believe... ...that you are Seth Mohd Adam. So you killed the real Adam for the sake of this mission? No! I believe Adam was killed by the Eastern Army... ...because they thought that was you. Like what I said before. Mistaken identity, collateral damage. Wait. Why did they try to kill Adam? I mean, me. -I guess... ...they thought the chip was with you, captain. Do you have the chip with you? How about Hairie? He died too. Hairie is Adam's brother. He has nothing to do with you, Khalif. I have Adam's family info..... No. Don't lie to me, will you? Don't mess with my head. Tell me the truth, can you? Captain, what else do you want? This is the answer to your..... Wait. How did you get this number? Our staff at the emergency unit... ...heard about fake calls... ...from a man who claimed himself as Seth Mohd Adam. A man who was dead. After he heard that name, he quickly call our unit. Look, Khalif. Honestly, I'm worried about you. I don't know what has happened to you... ...that make you thought you were Seth Mohd Adam. If you can tell me your location... ...I will tell my team to..... -Listen to me. Then we can sit down. And I can explain everything until you..... Hey! Listen here. You have this number. And you told me you're from the Royal Intelligence Corps. What are you waiting for? Trace this number and my location. Come and save me! This is what I've been doing since the moment... ...I started talking with you. Look. Give us some time and I promise you, captain. Mark my word. I will save you. Khalif, I just want to confirm with you. Where is the EMP-47 chip now? Is it true you have retrieved the chip? You want the EMP-47 location, right? Come and save me. -Come on, captain! Come and rescue me. -Retrieve the EMP-47 chip... ...is of our utmost importance now. My safety is your number one priority! Rescue me. It's that simple. I'll tell you the location. Come and save me. -Captain, listen to me first. He will come to save me. They will come. He has a severe wound from getting shot. But he refused to go to the hospital. Because he knows the police are hunting him. At least send a medical team... ...to treat him. Negative. Don't spoil this mission. He can't know who you are. Then let's start with our backup plan. He's weak now. I can use this chance to arrest him... ...and take him to the headquarters. Okay. But tell me. Does he have the EMP-47 chip with him right now? I'm not sure. Don't take the risk. We will make a move once we're sure he has the chip with him. We must have the EMP-47 chip no matter what. What do you want me to do now? The Eastern Army is hunting him and now hunting me. We don't have the time. My life is in danger now. Do you get it? This is your mission, captain. You're the greatest among the best. I'm sure you know what you should do now. Tell me! Tell me now! Why are they hunting you? Why did they try to kill you up there? What do you have that they want so badly? Why do you want to know? Now I get dragged in the mud with you. They recognized my face. So I have the right to know what's happening now. They want this. What is inside? Did I say you can touch it? Look, Adam. This is... ...the EMP-47 chip. Whoever has this chip, will rule the world. Adam, this small thing... ...costs 300 million. If it falls into the wrong hands... ...it will be the end of the world, Adam. The men who chased us earlier. They are the Eastern Army. The man who tried to kill me earlier..... That's Imam Muljam. The Eastern Army Commander in this country. So you stole the chip from them? That's why they tried to kill you? They want to kill me... ...not because I stole the chip. They want to kill me because I betrayed their crusade. You're part of the Eastern Army? I stole this chip, Adam. I stole it. I stole it because Imam Muljam wants to launch... ...the Palapa swear. And you know... ...what will happen if that comes true. Now I have it with me. This is my chance... ...to make things right. This is my chance, Adam. No matter what happens... ...this chip must be taken to the police headquarters tomorrow. No matter what. Go! My fight ends here. Hamzah, don't do anything crazy! You have saved me. Now let me save you, Adam. Let me save you. I only have one wish. Don't let them come close to Eva. Remember..... Don't let them come close to Eva. Hamzah! Hey! Go, Adam! Who tried to kill me earlier? Who are you? Don't let them come near Eva. You have to give this to the police. No, Hamzah. Let's do it together. Adam, listen to me. It's you who must give it to the police! Take it! Eva. Eva? Eva? Hello. Hello. Who is this? Hello! K.K. requests for a secured line for K.R.D. Yes, corporal. Please trace the location of this number. Yes. 016-6580987. I have it with me now. But they took Eva and make her hostage. No, don't try to teach me how to do my job. Tell major the mission succeed. Now I need to save Eva. Hamzah has been murdered..... I can't let Eva die too. Imam Muljam was there. Tell Major, if he wants to capture him,... ...send the offensive team there. To that address, okay? You're not Hamzah. Who are you? You keep on trying to ruin my plan. I'm looking for Eva. Where is Hamzah? Coward. His girlfriend almost died... ...but he still doesn't have the gut to face me. Wait. What are you talking about? Didn't you kill him? You killed him, right? Eva! I don't know you. I don't know why Eva and Hamzah are important to you. But the 30 minutes I gave you almost come to an end. What stuff are you talking about? I don't get it. I'm coming to take Eva home. You're taking her back? Eva! Adam, please..... Adam, please. Please help me! Your name is Adam. Do you have what I need, Adam? No. What stuff? Please, I don't get it. I don't know. Then I have no reasons to let you live. Please. No! -Stand up! Adam! Adam, please help me! Adam! Move! I already gave it to the police. And this place is now surrounded. If I don't take Eva out, they will ambush us. Please..... I have remembered it now. I was shot in the head by the Eastern Army. Do you think you're invisible? You were shot but still alive? -No. They shot me but they missed. It only grazed me. That's why I can't remember anything. Because..... -Oh, dear. You're suffering from post-traumatic amnesia. Usually, those with severe injury on the head... ...will suffer such an after-effect. A short-term memory loss. You for example. That's why you can't remember anything earlier. No wonder. But why did they try to shoot you? Wait. What's your name? Rene. -Rene. Rene, listen to me. I know you've tried your best to help me. Now you understand. Do you think it's easy being an operator? Can't we change the report? Say a kid is kidnapped or something. Can you do that? Which kid now? -Me. But you're not a kid. I can't make a false report. I will be done if my boss found out I lied. Okay, sir. Look. Try to remember the last thing that happened to you. I was shot. -Yes, I know but where? At my head. How many times should I say it? No, I meant the location. Did you know the location? Where did you get shot? Is it that hard to understand? I mean, was it on the roadside, on the roof... ...in a pool or inside a tiger cage? Where is it? Tell me. At an abandoned hotel. Before leaving Malacca City, there's an abandoned hotel. I was shot there. -Okay, I get it. Wait. My boss is coming. I'll call you later. Hello! She always keeps me waiting. I'm Eva. -Adam. "We have to sacrifice something to achieve something." The Adam that I know of... ...can't fight like that. Who are you? Whoever has this chip, will rule the world. Hello. -Adam! I have traced your location. How did you do it? Through that prayer call earlier. Do you remember? The prayer call? -Yes, the prayer call. Not some random call. You said you were shot at an abandoned hotel near... ...Malacca City. So I tried to look for an abandoned hotel nearby... ...the mosque of Malacca City. After some cross-over, there are only three... ...abandoned hotels near a mosque. I called all three mosques... ...and asked them to hear the prayer call... ...from your location. How did you do that? I recorded it. I clarify the prayer call from the recording. There's one mosque that claims that the call... ...was from their mosque. I quickly send a rescue team over there. That's how you do it. How would you know which building I'm in right now? Look. Behind that mosque, there's only one abandoned hotel. I'm sure you're trapped there. If not, I've told the police to check all buildings there. Until they found you. But you said no one believe me earlier. Who said they want to rescue you? They are hurrying to save a boy who was kidnapped... ...after school. And I told them... ...the kidnapper was waiting for ransom. Rene..... Rene..... You made a fake report? Yes, Adam. I've promised to help you, right? It's fine. What's important now is, once the police arrived... ...they will still find someone who is locked up. Thank you, Rene. Thank you. Thank God. Thank you so much, Rene. Okay, just wait there, Mr Adam. Until the cops arrived. If they called you again, don't answer them. Nothing would work if you fell into their trap. Okay, Rene. Don't worry. I'll stay here. Thank you, Rene. You should be proud of yourself. This is your first day. -Hello. Mr Adam? Hello. Rene? Don't hang up. -Hey, bastard. Do you think you can escape just like that? Listen. The police are on their way. Yes, on their way to collect your body. You're not free yet. -Not yet. Once the police arrived... ...they will set me free. You can't go anywhere... ...because the whole place will be surrounded. It is surrounded. Surrounded by my motion bomb. Once the police step into that building..... The best thing is, I'm not even there, Adam. I'm not there. Hello! Eva! Eva! What have you done to her? Hey! Let her go now! If you didn't give me the chip location now... ...Eva will die. Listen. Even if the chip is with me... ...I won't give it to you. I know what you'll do with that chip. I can do whatever I want! Do you want to see her dead? -Let her go now... ...or you won't get the chip at all. I won't get it? I have other ways to obtain the chip. But you? Eva? You won't do it because only I know the location of the chip. It's up to you, Adam. You make the call. You won't do it. All this happened because of you, Captain Khalif. Hello! Hey! Let her go! She's innocent! Let her go! Please let her go! She's innocent! Please let her go. I know the location of the chip. I know the location of the chip. Let her go. Please let her go. Please don't hurt her. Please! Until when are you going to keep me here? Please let me go. Hey! Bastard! Let me go! Please. Don't hurt her. They won't let me go. They won't let me go. They have no reasons to let me go. If I can't have it, then no one else can. I will make sure no one will get it. Do you hear that? No one will get it. No one will have it. Hey! Do you think you can get away that easily? Where is Eva? Where is she? Eva? Where is she, you bastard! You..... Aren't you already dead? I should ask you the same question. What's the meaning of all this, Hamzah? Mr Adam, I'm Inspector Azizul from the Counter-Terrorism Unit. My team is trying to trace your location. You..... It was you who locked me up. You locked me up. What do you want from me, Hamzah? I saw you die in front of me. Are you sure that you saw me dead? Try to remember. Not even one bullet hit me. Those who attacked us are my men. You and the whole world... ...have been lied to. But why? That's the only way... ...for me to ensure the police and Eastern Army... ...will stop bothering me. Do you think I don't know who you are? Captain Khalif. Do you think I don't recognize my own friend? Why did you do this? Because you are the most perfect person... ...to take the EMP-47 chip to Kuala Lumpur. Who are you? You're undercover police from the special branch. Police won't arrest another policeman, right? That's why you're the most perfect person... ...to take the EMP-47 chip... ...to Kuala Lumpur for me! You've been using me the whole time? All these are mind games, brother. Mind games, brother. Mind games! You follow along with my plan without you realizing it. You are a part of my plan. You said you gave the chip to the police. The Eastern Army hunted you down because they want that chip. Yes, the Eastern Army was looking for me. But not because I betrayed them. No, it's not. No! I have principles! I have a vision! I have a vision unlike the Eastern Army! EMP-47 is the most powerful weapon in the world now. Imagine it. The most powerful weapon... ...falls into my hand. Try to imagine it. The things I can achieve. The things I can do. So, I'm asking you one more time. Captain Khalif. Where is my EMP-47? Eva! -Hey! You will kill her just for the chip? You don't know the things I would do... ...for my EMP-47. Where is it? Okay, Hamzah. Okay! I will tell you its location. Now, please. Let me and Eva go. That's not my plan. What now? Insolent woman. This is your real plan? Seduce him, make him fall in love with you. Then, make him lose his focus. In the meantime, I'll try to get the chip. Then, he will help us... ...to take the chip to Kuala Lumpur... ...for us, Eva. You're useless. Insolent woman! Who's insolent? Who is it now? Insolent..... Let's go, Eva. Mr Adam, it's me Inspector Azizul from the Counter-Terrorism Unit. Our team is trying to trace you now. Why? You said I should take all chances in front of me. Be aggressive, Eva. This is me being aggressive. Do you think you can escape? Girls like me can do anything... ...and get away with it. Men will be tested with women. Adam, I think you have just failed your test. We need to sacrifice something... ...to gain something. Am I right? I'm sorry, Adam. Please don't make this harder for me, okay?
