Bio-Rio, the town's proud movie theater showing great films like Tarzan, Captain Blood and King Kong. Tonight it's Errol Flynn with lots of smooching. So it's for adults only. Not even I, Charles-Ingvar Jönsson, am allowed in. All the kids trying to get in are stopped and held in a stranglehold by constable Pinnen Persson. But not Doris, all dressed up, and her incredibly sexy mother Lucy. -Good evening, Pinnen. -Good evening. You'll go straight home! The weird cousins Ragnar Vanheden and gunpowder-crazy Harry have found a way of getting past Pinnen. Via the roof. This isn't dangerous, is it? Please tell me it isn't. It isn't. Trust me! I'll handle this, you know. A piece of cake for a Vanheden! What?! It's locked! I was told it would be open. Maybe we could just knock? Only Harry could come up with that idea. It's Karlsson-on-the-Roof! Calm down, it's just an ordinary four-eyes. Hey, get out of my way! If a blind Norwegian elephant had climbed down here, it would have been less clumsy than Vanheden. Come on, Harry. We'll miss the movie. Jump! It's so far down. Jump! Now we're in the dark! How about that? I'm always well equipped. Ragnar is really something! I've got a plan for how we can get in. A plan?! Timed and prepared, down to the last detail. What do you mean, you little weed? I'm the boss around here. We've got our own plan. Come on, Harry. I'll handle this. It's a piece of cake for a Vanheden! -The door is locked. -This one, too? So how do we get in? You can't trust anyone nowadays. Maybe we should've listened to the weed. Run, Harry! It was timed and prepared, down to the last detail. My plan was certainly one of the best from the magical history of movies. Cowboys and Indians, you're past it! Here comes Charles-Ingvar Jönsson. Check out his style! And his trousers… That's really something! The next step was getting in the projection room. I happened to know that the attendant would pass exactly… Now! Perfect. "Timed and prepared…" PROJECTIONIST Beginner's luck! Chewing gum… Yummy! Everything went according to plan. The film was about to begin. But for the moment a newsreel was showing. Finally I was behind the screen. What a plan! A brilliant plan! No one could ruin my night now. It was only me and the film. Or so I thought. I accidently touched the switch. Beat it, Harry! The lock has jammed. This wasn't part of my plan, so I had to think fast. Charles-Ingvar Jönsson! Mom and Dad… How lucky! I'm lost! ONE WEEK EARLIER This is how it started. My dad had got a new job and moved before us to make plans and get things ready. That's what he always said, but things never turned out as planned. Now the time had come for us to move. If only my brother Sven-Ingvar, who later became a well-known singer, could stop singing! Is this the right way, Sickan? I'll answer that when Sven-Ingvar has stopped singing. Please, Sven-Ingvar… Shut up! Shut up! -Charles-Ingvar, don't shout like that! -Sickan did it first. Sickan is my nasty twin sister. She is only one minute older and very cocky. We only stick together when we want Sven-Ingvar to shut up. WELCOME TO WALL-ENTUNA. Movie star trading cards, cards you collect and swap. You need as many as possible. Some are more valuable than others. Errol Flynn and James Dean are the hardest ones to find and more valuable than gold and diamonds. I suddenly realized… Power, status, and pals were things I could only get if I got hold of movie cards. Leasing means that you rent out the car instead of selling it, but at a price that means that the lessee indirectly has to cough up for it all. I sit on the dough and I make sure it flows in. This is a new idea, imported directly from the States. Leasing means that you rent out a car instead of selling it, but at a price that means that the lessee indirectly has to pay for it all. The car is still mine. I make all the money. That's how "corpitalism" works. It's brilliant business! Wave, Charles-Ingvar, it might be a new friend. My sister Sickan was impressed and waved cheerfully when we saw Ragnar Vanheden and his family of car freaks for the first time. I've got to split. There, to the left of the undertaker, Doris's Mom, Lucy, has a beauty shop. The ladies go there for the latest treatments, hoping that someone, like me, will give them a wolf whistle. But I'd never do that. I have more important things to do. -Do you want another sandwich? -No, I have to go. Of course Harry should have another sandwich. No… He was in a hurry! -Harry, hurry up! They're here! -Wait! Did you hear that, Ragnar? That was a heck of a bang! Brilliant, Harry, brilliant! -What a heck of a bang! -He's just wonderful! -Isn't he just like his grandpa? -Yes, he's just like you! Here we are! -Where's Dad? -There. Welcome to Wall-Entuna and Villa Jönsson. Family hug! Loket, the most dangerous person in town, serves breakfast to the richest family in town - the Wall-Enbergs. Director Wall-Enberg has great plans for Wall-Entuna, which he owns. That's why the town is called Wall-Entuna. Junior Wall-Enberg can have as many boxes of cornflakes as he wants. Every box contains a movie star card. Have you done Junior's homework? Biffen, Loket's son and Junior's obedient servant, is the strongest and hungriest fellow in town. He can eat 10 boxes of cornflakes, burp and produce 13 odorless farts. At the same time! Isn't it today that the inventor… I was just thinking of phoning them to say welcome. -…moves in? -The phone! My robot takes care of the boxes. No more backache. Backache? I've never had any backache. -Jönsson. -Good morning. This is your neighbor, Director Wall-Enberg. I didn't want to pay you a visit so early in the morning, but I want to welcome you to Wall-Entuna. He's in his garden talking to Dad through a small box. Thank you very much. Our apples are our apples and your apples are of course your apples. I was thinking of the children. Have you got children? Perfect. Then we'll get on well together. Thank you. Jacob Morgan Rockefeller Wall-Enberg Junior, what are you doing? Ouch! Poor Biffen. He got the blame and was punished for something Junior had done, as usual. Someone from the Wall-Enberg family always behaves like a gentleman. And he is never ever… curious. Tora! Come outside with the kids! We're trying out my new invention. My dad isn't like other dads. He is a genius and an inventor. An extremely kind inventor. No one understands his great inventions, not even he himself. The radio phone and the Jönsson robot are two brilliant inventions. But my dad doesn't realize that. Someone else will patent these inventions and others become famous and earn a fortune. I'm thinking of the evil villain, Director Wall-Enberg. It's set for one box at a time. The old conveyor belt trick! The Americans do that all the time with their Fords. -It's nothing new. -I see. Today's paper! The newspaper. That was a heck of a bang! Do you want marmalade or honey on your toast? Marmalade… and no butter! At Doris and Lucy's place beauty was everything. Doris wanted to find two particular movie cards. No others would do. Doris had made her own album for all her movie cards. But two special ones were missing and she wanted them at any cost: Errol Flynn and James Dean. Hi, Harry, look at my beauty! It's a Chevy. Tell your grandpa that he can get one soon. I'm going to lease them out. I got the idea from the States. All the Yankees lease their cars. I see. Ragge, our smelly cousin is here! It's gunpowder. Grandpa says it smells nice. Hey, don't keep Harry waiting! He might explode. If Harry could explode, it would have happened long ago. You're almost as crazy as your grandpa. You silly twit! -I am…? -Oh, little Harry is here. Dynamite-Harry! Here are your sandwiches, Ragnar. And a warm scarf. I've noticed that you've got a bit of a cold. There you are. Take care, my little sweetie. Oh yes, do, my dear boy! Come on, Harry! Bye. Harry, don't forget to tell grandpa about leasing. What a nice scarf. The time had come. My first day at the new school! I made sure I stayed away from my older sister. Oh, yeah! Dynamite-Harry… I like that name! Shut up! -Your scarf is really nice. -I know. Junior Wall-Enberg always arrived in the family's black limousine. But Biffen had a tougher journey. Inhaling exhaust fumes is not very nice. The headmaster is coming! Move! The headmaster didn't like children. He just loved himself and Director Wall-Enberg. He sucked up to him in a suspicious way. -Morning, Director. -Morning, Headmaster. -Are the documents ready? -Yes, they're in… -They're in the safe. -Watertight? Once we've got the signatures the decision is final. -And here's a model of the future! -And my new office. -I mean the new school. -Here it is. Here you are. I thought the headmaster's office would be a bit more… luxurious. -We can of course make improvements. -Right. Out of my way! Excellent! Then we'll meet at my place on Monday. -Don't forget your swimming trunks! -Of course not. Thanks. It's rather cold today. Don't you think so, Ragnar? Okay, here you are! Stop nagging! Charles-Ingvar? According to this, your name is… Sickan. Sickan! Hi, babe! Sickan is my twin sister. We fight a lot, so my parents put her in the other class. Charles-Ingvar? What kind of a name is that? A guy in funny trousers can have a funny name. His younger brother, the singer, is called Sven-Ingvar. Charles-Ingvar… Please tell us a little about yourself and your family. -What do your mother and father do? -My dad is an inventor, an engineer. He's working on the automation of the cornflakes factory. Mom takes care of Dad. We live at 13 Lion Street. I see. Then you can do your homework with Morgan Wall-Enberg. Thank you very much, Charles-Ingvar. You can sit down… …behind Doris. The best football team - Hammarby or Djurgården? -Djurgården. -Watch out during the break… -I mean Hammarby. -You should have said AIK. -AIK. -Too late! Where did he go? Now, watch the legs! They bounce like stiff-legged ants on a frog hunt in the African desert. He'll emerge sooner or later. Let's do business! Junior and Biffen walk around behaving like kings, and they are the richest guys with all their movie cards. They trade one for four new ones and nobody dares to object. But I've got a plan for getting hold of thousands of movie cards and becoming the most popular guy. But I need some help. From two guys who also want cards and who pretend they've got plenty, but that's only a bunch of blank cards between two real movie cards. Two guys who need me. Have you got Errol Flynn or James Dean yet? No. Anyone who gets me those will be my friend for life. What if it's a boy? Then I'll give him ten kisses on his lips. I'll get you the movie cards, Doris. How are you going to get hold of them, Harry? We have no movie cards. You'll trade with what? Gun powder? No, never! Not my firecrackers! Morgan says you can forget about doing your homework with him. -Sickan… -My homework? The teacher told you to do your homework with Morgan Wall-Enberg. -Does he need assistance? -Not him. You! I'll take that. We're not educating dynamiters here. Now, hurry to your class! He grabbed Harry's firecrackers! Is that allowed? We'll get them later… I know where we can get millions of movie cards. We already have a bunch of them. -But the headmaster… -Come on! Biffen's favourite occupation: hurting people with drawing pins. First of all you cut out a pattern. It can be a fish or a star or something imaginative. You dip the potato in paint and then you press it down on a sheet of paper. -No Errol or Flynn for Doris? -I don't give a damn about Doris. We need movie cards in order to be popular. You can start now. Be careful with the knives, so you don't cut yourself. Hey, Sickan! Who has put a drawing pin on my chair? Charles-Ingvar… On your first day at school! Go to the corner and stay there for the rest of the lesson! Movie cards… I have a plan, timed and prepared. -Sickan's got a plan, Ragnar! -I heard that. I'm not deaf. Why don't we listen to him? We can't hang out with that weed in the corner! I've got a plan of my own. This afternoon we'll get our cards and firecrackers back from the headmaster. Come in. Good afternoon. I'm new in class 5A. Charles-Ingvar Jönsson. -And what do you want from me? -The teacher sent me to get some books. TOP SECRET -Sickan? -Charles-Ingvar! Of course, Sickan! Harry, look for the dynamite. We're getting my firecrackers. I've got a plan, timed and prepared, down to the last detail. Did you hear that, Ragnar? He's got a plan. Hey, we do this our way. You've got it? Stop grinning or I'll get the headmaster. That would mean goodbye, auf Wiedersehen, and hasta la vista to you, Sickan. If the headmaster comes back, we're the ones who shouldn't be here. Harry! I know where we can get billions of movie cards. -Billions? -Billions! But we must work together. -Billions of cards, just waiting for us? -Yes! Do you think Errol Flynn or James Dean are there, too? -I don't think, I know. -Great! They are the ones I need, Sickan. Charles… Now, let's hear the plan or are you just talking rubbish? Not here. We need a secret place, where we can talk freely. Harry's hut! Oh, there you are, sweetie! You're late from school today. -Headmaster Jansson said that… -He said that Harry is a model boy. Really? That's great, Harry. -Yes. -It's brilliant. That's really something to celebrate! Watch out! No, Elis, not now… Oh dear! No, not again! -Sickan's got a plan. -Come, we must do our homework! -But… -Harry! You first. There you go… -I don't know… -Get in, Sickan. Into the basket… -But it's very high up. -Don't worry. What could happen? I could fall down and die. Watch out! Hold tight, Sickan. Do you want some juice, Sickan? Some strawberry juice? Harry and I have our secret meetings here without people interfering. -Don't you think it's great? Say it! -It's perfect. -Did you hear that, Ragnar? -Oh, yeah! It's brilliant! Okay, Sickan, here you are… Not like that, Charles-Ingvar! First you blow lots of bubbles. Then you slurp, feeling the tickling up your nose. Watch me! Try it! Harry's juice drinking was already getting on my nerves. It can't be healthy! And where does he pee? Through the window? I've worked out a plan, a brilliant plan. The most brilliant plan ever, timed and… -Billions of movie cards. -Errol Flynn and James Dean! Where do you find movie cards? -In boxes of cornflakes. -Exactly! -And where do they come from? -The cornflakes factory. But you can't get hold of them there. As it happens, I'm in possession of information about that factory. The cornflakes factory, on Factory Street, has hired my dad, Sigvard Jönsson, for the automation. The box that will have the precious content is put on the conveyor belt at 11:14 p.m. on Friday nights. An exact quantity of cornflakes is filled at the next station. Then the box comes to a station that is of interest to us. The robot takes a card from a highly secure vault, where they are stored. It measures the weight exactly, in order to pick up only one card. But it has the capacity of picking up 1,276 movie cards, if you change its suction power with a lever where the supervisor sits on the other side of the gluing machine. Finally the boxes are loaded into a delivery van, and on Mondays they are delivered to the stores. Any questions? Brilliant, Sickan! But how do we get in? Through the only way with no alarm: the ventilation shaft on the roof. On the roof? You're the specialist, Ragnar! Everything is planned down to the last detail. We need a flagpole with a flag and halyard. A pair of scissors, a saw. A newspaper, a dog bone. A fishing rod, a slingshot. And a firecracker with a fuse with a burning time of exactly 13.2 seconds. Firecrackers! That's for me! BLIND PLEASE HELP Look up there! That's how we got a saw. A newspaper. Tell her we're going to cut out paper dolls. -Hi there, Harry! -Hello. -Doris isn't in. -I know, but… The others out there… I mean… My sweet little friend, what do you want? We are going to… out there… They want me to… I mean… -Do you want a pair of scissors? -Yes. Well, no problem! Here you are. A pair of scissors. Firecrackers. Look… a fishing rod! What a surprise! Something's biting. We had all the things we needed to carry out my brilliant plan. And tonight was the night! The time had come for the great cornflakes factory robbery! The guy who gets me the movie cards will get ten kisses on his lips. I'll get you the movie cards, Doris. -Have you got my missing movie cards? -I'll have them tomorrow. But… Who… It's just my brother. Don't worry about him. -But… we can't… -Come on! Nearly all the world's beauties have I met… My plan is a brilliant masterpiece. -Put out the light, little brother. -Charles-Ingvar! …I met a girl from Värmland and she… -You're only one minute older than me. -Good night, little one. Sven-Ingvar, keep quiet! …sweet beauty from Fryken… -Shut up! -Shut up! Come on, Harry! Hurry up! -Scissors. -Scissors. Scissors! Harry borrowed this one. Harry, Vanheden and I had become real good friends. As if we would always stay together, even as grown-ups. Harry told me he had got lost in the playground the week before, and he didn't even cry. I told him about the day my mom found the cookie jar empty and crumbs on my cheeks. You only tell your best friends such embarrassing things. -Fishing rod. -Fishing rod. -Scissors. -Scissors. -Firecrackers. -Firecrackers. One thousand and nine, one thousand and ten, one thousand and thirteen. Now, I think. Yes… now! Exactly 13.2 seconds! What a heck of a bang! Greger, the guard at the flakes factory, has a dodgy stomach, and whenever something happens he goes to the toilet. Jump, Harry! No, I like it up here. Jump! No, not Harry, it's too high. Jump, Harry! What a damn good jump! -What a jump! -Come on, Harry! -All according to the plan. -Of course. Do you think Errol Flynn and James Dean are in there, too? Of course! But the number is limited to get people to buy more cornflakes. -That's how "corpitalism" works. -I see. Newspaper. Ready. Slingshot. -Ready. -Now! Already! A free newspaper! That throw was just perfect. The robot went crazy and did exactly as in our garden. It took a whole bunch, or to be precise, 1,276 movie cards. -All according to the plan. -Timed down to the last detail. What the… Harry! I accidentally touched that little switch… I've outperformed everyone. Here I am! Charles-Ingvar Jönsson, Ragnar Vanheden and Harry Kruth! And we've just become millionaires. That's timing! I've delivered papers before. I went right up to Lucy and got a pair of scissors. A piece of cake to hit the clock! 1,276 movie cards. We're rich! Two of them are for Doris. We should have a name. Charles-Ingvar and his boys, maybe? The robbery was Sickan's idea… We ought to be The Jönsson Gang after a person with a brilliant mind. -And who is that? -Me, of course. Relax, Sickan, of course we'll call ourselves The Jönsson Gang. We wouldn't have a single movie card without you. You're the brain, the genius. -I couldn't have done it without you. -We're quite good as well. Are we? Yes! You're terrific, too! What will Junior and Biffen say when they see all our movie cards? Let's go and show them at once! -Are you looking for a fight? -No, thanks. I've got something to show Morgan Wall-Enberg. Cornflakes? No, movie cards, or to be precise, 1,276 movie cards! Interesting. Maybe we can do business after all. Well, we might trade a few. If you have anything we want. -Where are the movie cards? -In a safe place. Hand them over now and we won't beat you up. -I don't think so. -Are you deaf? Give it to me! We must have taken the wrong box at the factory. The right one must be on its way to Hansson's food store. You'll suffer at school on Monday. Your nerdy friends as well! I'd wanted to show them the new millionaire of Wall-Entuna, but it didn't turn out as expected. The cap had become a beret. Harry had most certainly lost his Doris. My brilliant plan… Where did it go wrong? -Good evening, constable. -You've had an early breakfast! -I hope he won't get lost again. -I'll see to that. -Many thanks! -You're welcome. -Good night. -Good night. You're confined to your room the whole weekend. Confined to my room! For the first time I, Charles-Ingvar Jönsson, was under lock and key. But Mom, who normally cares about me, said it wouldn't be the last time. We must celebrate Sickan's release. What a bore to be locked up the whole weekend! Sickan! -Sickan! -Charles-Ingvar! -Charles-Ingvar. -Charles-Ingvar! Whoopee, Sickan! Here we are, The Jönsson Gang! Welcome out, Sickan! Great hat! -Beret? -Thanks. What about you? A hat? Yeah, it's a genuine pork pie hat. Dad wore it driving around in cars. It's very nice, Ragnar. Dad was wearing it the first time he kissed Mom. -And what's that? -And what's that, Ragnar? Look, Sickan, a soapbox car! The latest model! Dad, my sis, my mom and I worked all night. And this morning it was ready. A poshbox car. -A poshbox car? -Oh, yeah! A posh soapbox car becomes a poshbox car. That's brilliant! Now we've got a car that can take us to school. We can leave home a few minutes later and we won't be exhausted at all. Now what? Hansson had the first self-service store in Wall-Entuna. The lost cornflakes box could only be on its way there. It was time for action! Junior Wall-Enberg or The Jönsson Gang - who would get hold of the box? Hello, Grocer Hansson? Then I've got the right number. This is Director Wall-Enberg. Perfect timing! Our teacher will be happy. Great, Vanheden! This car is really brilliant! -Where are the movie cards, Sickan? -There were only cornflakes. Cornflakes?! It was all timed and prepared, down to the last detail. But you two made a mess of things! Idiots! I don't get it. How could we get the wrong box? What will Doris say? The right box is on its way to Hansson's food store. Junior and Biffen are trying to get it, but we must get it before them. How do you know? How do they know? -I've got a plan. -Here we go again… Can't you have something else for a change? First of all we need a lipstick. Come in. Sorry, we're late. What are those spots on your faces? Rubella, I think. It's not "scarf fever" at least. No, definitely not "scarf fever." Have you had rubella, Miss? Well… I don't know really. I think you'd better… You'd better go home, before you infect anyone. Shouldn't you be in class now, Ragnar? Yes… No, we've got "scarlet scarf fever" so we were sent home. You can have that, since you've got a slight cold. But please go now. -How does it work? -Put it up your nose and inhale. Leave now. You'll scare the customers. -Aren't there any cornflakes? -No. Director Wall-Enberg just bought the whole stock. We'd been beaten again. Junior had won the race. Junior thought he could hide the cornflakes boxes from me, Charles-Ingvar Jönsson, but he was mistaken. -I'm coming. -Perfect! -Of course! -You look like a gangster. -I'm glad you could come. -My pleasure! If there's money to make there's always an interest. Exactly! But first we'll have a dip. Did you bring your swimming trunks? I'll get it! Where are Doris's movie cards? Take it easy, Sickan. We'll handle this. Just relax! -What do you think you're doing? -Well… You've gone through the boxes. Great! You've finished the job. -Junior will take care of that. -No! Come on headmaster, let's jump in! What the… Morgan! -It was them! -Them…? Just wait till I get hold of you! Jönsson! There'll be no school transport, no sweets, no movies. And you'll pay for all the cornflakes with your pocket money. I'll take this box and lock it up. You'll have to buy it. Where did they go? Hello? Where are you, guys? Hello! Beda! -Come on! -But what about Sickan? Forget about him. His plans didn't work out very well. -They did. -You think so? -Have you got any movie cards? -No. Well, it didn't turn out quite as planned. Those things happen when there are children around. Ask me! As a headmaster I've seen it all. This little incident… I hope it won't affect Morgan Junior's school report. Of course not. -What about our plans? -All under control. It's on the local council agenda the day after tomorrow. -And they don't suspect anything? -Nothing at all. -And the new permits? -Safely stored in my office. -No one may see them yet. -Of course not. I can't understand why it has to be so difficult to redevelop things. My new headmaster's office! It's been my dream ever since I was a trainee teacher. Development and future! We don't want to stop that, do we? No. Stop fiddling with the tap. You've already had five glasses! What will Doris say? We haven't got any movie cards. -Who has time to think about Doris? -I often think about her. -Sickan… -I've got a plan. Hi, boss! I didn't think we'd see you again. The box is in Wall-Enberg's safe. We can easily do a trade. We'll take a top secret envelope from Headmaster Jansson's safe. My plan is brilliant. We need a piece of cake, a board on wheels, and a clothesline. Now! A piece of cake? Some people do understand the value of a good education. -The plan is perfect, Charles-Ingvar. -Of course. The safe… -Franz Jaeger? -It's a new safe. What's your plan now? -The combination… -Do you know it? Look for it on his desk. He must have written it down somewhere. Do that, Harry. Look for a note with numbers. Harry! Harry… TOP SECRET Brilliant, Sickan! -Brilliant! -Of course! Hello! Anybody there? -The light… -The light? The light! HEADMASTER -Is there anybody here? -No. Right. What does it say? This, my friends, is material that will affect our future. -Who owns this district? -Wall-Enberg! Yes, and he has applied for permission to build a playground. -He's really a nice guy, Junior's dad. -No, there is another document. Only Wall-Enberg and Headmaster Jansson know about it. It gives Wall-Enberg the right to demolish all of Wall-Entuna. Our school, Lucy's beauty shop. Everything! And build multistory car parks, offices and factories. They'll also demolish the house, where you and Doris live. Our hut too, then… But this is the home of The Jönsson Gang! I built it myself, they can't just tear it down. They're going to make councillors sign the wrong document. The permit for the playground. But what they'll get is lots of concrete. Where are Doris and I supposed to live? Relax. I've got a brilliant plan as always. There you are. Sickan's got a plan. What are you doing here? I want a word with the director. My father's got nothing to say to you. Tell him that I, Charles-Ingvar Jönsson, have the top secret envelope. Junior, let the boy in! You go up and do your homework. Welcome. So, it's all about a top secret envelope. -And it's mine. -It was yours. For the time being, I have it in my possession. -And the content…? -If I know about it? Yes. I think I understand. But I assure you that nothing will be revealed. All I want is the cornflakes box you've got in your safe. You'll get the box and I'll get the envelope. Yes, and I want you to persuade Headmaster Jansson to give me the highest grade for behavior and conduct. Then you won't reveal any secrets from the envelope? Promise not to tear down the block with Lucy's beauty shop. Then I can trust you…? Where are the documents right now? In a safe place. Then we'll get on well, won't we? Would you like a glass of nice, cold, homemade elderflower juice? Yes, please. What a success! What a plan! If only Harry had been here now. Homemade elderflower juice! Of course the negotiations should finish with a drink. But Mom never told me I was allergic to homemade elderflower juice. Not Wall-Enberg's juice anyway. I think Loket made a mistake and gave me the wrong glass, because I suddenly felt hot and my head was spinning. Actually, I felt like a funny guy, which was new to me… I'm not a funny guy! Excellent juice! I hope the negotiation goes to plan. Trust Sickan! He's got a good head on his shoulders. Let's have another one! Oops… Let's have… Oh no! You mustn't tickle me… Keep him away until the documents are signed. Nothing can stop the development. My elderflower allergy got stronger. I couldn't understand why things went wrong. Again! The plan was brilliant, down to the last detail. How could he find the envelope? I had put it in such a foolproof place. Look! Sickan's beret… He was in the zebra skin! Window cleaning! Window cleaning for free! Your windows will be shining! The latest window polish from the States! Your wife has never seen windows as clean as these before. What? We've got to be quick about it! The trunk… Oh, no! Where are you, you cheeky little brat! Get out! Where are you? I'll get you the movie cards, Doris. I, Charles-Ingvar Jönsson, have been fooled. I've been humiliated, degraded, and conned, but I've got a plan. Wall-Enberg will be in charge of the playground, upkeep and planting, and he'll ban all traffic around the playground. As town councillor I hereby hand over to our chairman, Mr. Hjalmar Even-Moor. Mr. Even-Moor… As chairman of the town council, I recommend that Wall-Enberg immediately get a planning permit for his playground. -A playground is a wonderful idea! -Let's vote. Who are in favor…? The planning permit is granted. -Gentlemen… -Welcome! We were just signing the permit for your playground. Excellent! I'm glad you want to share my ambition to make our beautiful town still more beautiful. The standard swap-document-trick, old but still effective. In the new document we read: "The whole area is to be concreted over and rebuilt for industries, "multistory car parks and through traffic. "This decision is final and cannot be reversed." Well, if that's all, I'd like to invite you all for lunch. We can have a cigar and celebrate the playground. Nasty men! But this isn't over yet. The genius has got a plan. That's right! We're now entering phase two. We had to get hold of the permit at Wall-Enberg's place before excavators and dynamite would destroy our town and our hut. BEFORE AFTER Director Wall-Enberg. Hello? Is anyone there? Yes, this is Ragnar McDonald and I'm calling from the States. -My business is leasing. -Oh… I mean yes. Rail! I know you want to build a multistory carpark without my permission. In concrete. You can't do that! I'm the inventor of the multistory car park! Train. You know, I've got a big leasing company over here, so I had to invent the multistory car park for all my cars. So I've applied for a patent. Harry! What's happening? They're shooting outside. It's a bit wild over here, you know. -Oh, yes, yes, my dear boy. -My dear boy? Well, I have no time for small talk! My lawyer will call you. Good bye! -Hello? Director? -Yes. -It's chaos down here. -I see. -Can you come now? -I'll be right there. How dare you bring your filthy machines here? If you want to tear things down, you'll have to go elsewhere! You won't touch anything here! Not the playground, the houses, or my beauty shop. -And not Harry's hut. -No, not Harry's hut either. But Lucy… Mrs. Andersson, there's a decision about demolition. From the town council, and it's unappealable. Un… what…? The decision can't be changed. It's final. Director Wall-Enberg will soon be here, and then everything will be sorted out. On behalf of our town, I thank you for coming here. -Did you bring the document? -No. -We must know that it is valid. -I didn't bring it. Don't you take my word for it? In ten minutes we'll blow up the playground. The excavators will do the rest. -Quick! The soapbox car… -Where are you going, guys? Go, Harry! Go! We had to act quickly to get the document with the new stamp on it. The future of Wall-Entuna rested on our muscular shoulders. What are you doing here? Morgan! Sickan is in the study! Go! -Junior and Biffen! -Faster! -Do something, Pinnen! -What can I do? Yeah, what can he do? The decision has been made. Watch out! You can't get away! Faster! I've got a plan. Turn right! Now! -No! Turn right! -What? A perfect turn! Well, it's time for an explosion! -Stop! -Watch out Wait a minute, Director Wall-Enberg! Good! It's the planning permit. So that's it, then. But look! It has been stamped with "NO." I suppose that must mean…no?! What the…? Stop, in the name of the law! Go home! There'll be no bang bang! Hurray! Harry, what about my movie cards? Well, we haven't finished that part. Right, Ragnar? Sure, Harry, it's cool. -But you will get them, won't you? -Yes. Brilliant, little brother! Well, that worked out all right, you little genius. But we still haven't got any movie cards. I don't get it. How could we get the wrong box at the factory? What are you talking about, boys? What box? What factory? We're planning on having our own business. It's the only way to get rich! Errol Flynn and James Dean! Doris's movie cards. Look, what I found! Harry, I thought you'd forgotten! They must have fallen out of my pocket when I sat down. Sickan! The water is full of movie cards. Our movie cards! Just waiting to be picked up. I had to act as if having a dip was part of my brilliant plan. We had managed to get our movie cards back. Everything was okay. We were the Jönsson Gang. Doris finally got her Errol Flynn and James Dean. Harry got his Doris and a thousand kisses on his lips. But Vanheden and I weren't allowed to watch. We became millionaires, at least for a while, and I started working on my next plan, but that's another story. -That's absolutely brilliant. -Of course! That's absolutely brilliant! Cheers! -We are millionaires. Let's celebrate! -Listen, I've got a plan. It might not work… I'm not used to plans. It'll work, Harry. It's a great plan. Absolutely brilliant! What the… Jacob Morgan Rockefeller Wall-Enberg! I'm asleep. I was asleep. Don't give me that! Stop this immediately! -I don't know anything about this. -All these firecrackers… You'll have no pocket money for at least two weeks! But… it must be Jönsson… Subtitle Translation by: Tina Engström
