Let us be, Ma! What is this stink coming out of my kitchen? We don't say shit when you play the clarinet so let us be in our kitchen. - My kitchen! - Why is your fridge empty then? We're hungry! You don't take care of us. What did I do to deserve this? Why aren't you more like January Jack? - You love it more than us? - At least he's a good son. I told you she loves him more than us. Take him for a walk, I'm sick of you staying inside. Come on, go away. What the fuck is smelling so bad? It's poo! You're cooking poo in my kitchen! Are you kidding me? - Ma, it's not poo! - No Ma, it's not. It's merguez. - That's what steak looks like. - So is it steak or merguez? I swear, we're not lying Ma. It's an organic steak! It's meat! Go ahead, have a taste, Ma. No, stop! Put it down! That's it, now. You guys are out of here. - I can't believe this! - Taste it. What? Come on, taste. Ma! Look, it's meat! Why are you feeding him this? You moron, it's shit! You're eating shit! Issachar, don't! Stop it! Don't do that! Are you stupid or what? I can't believe this! Issachar, spit it out! - Spit it out! - You're going to die! Spit it out! Quick! Spit it the fuck out! MOTHER SCHMUCKERS Tell us the way Tell us the way Leading to the light Come on, January Jack. Oh, he's so cute. Come here... Can we pet him? - You want to buy him? - He's 1,000 euros. - A bit expensive, isn't it? - What's his name? January Jack. - Is he sick? - Yes, he's very old. He's got testicular cancer. - Really? - Yes. This looks so yummy. I'm on it. Tell us about you. It looks yummy. Thanks. - I want to talk too. - You know you can't. - Let us talk. - I can talk to the both of you. - As you wish. - Do you live together? Yes but it's temporary. I'm supposed to move out. What? What happened? - Are you OK? - What happened? Why didn't he share the food? - Are you serious? - Calm down. If your dog bites, don't let it come close to a kid. - Don't you agree? - You let the kid come close to our dog. He's bitten me a lot and I'm not whining about it. - Don't worry, Ma'am. - You're crazy! Relax, Ma'am. - What have you done to my dog? - Are you kidding? Stop yelling! He's the one yelling! He's not the problem! Don't you touch my son! Take your hands off! We didn't start it, he did. - He tried to steal our dog. - He didn't! It's you and your dog who are crazy as fuck. OK, time to say goodbye. Peacefully. No, you stay here! Dogs are not allowed. - We have no dog. - Get lost, you never have any money. - Relax. - Why are you getting upset? We'll leave the dog here. OK. If he leaves, it will be on you! You stay with him, not me! January Jack, you hear him? He doesn't give a shit about you. January Jack, you know I love you! I told you I'm not staying with him. You wait for us. Shit. These little sausages look so good! This cheese is calling me. On bread, it will taste like heaven. I'll grab some stuff too then. Don't be stupid, we don't have any money. - What? - We have no money! So what? We'll find a way. - No, we won't. - Yes, we will! Hey, kids! How are you? - You piss off! Get lost! - Cut it out, Issachar. Hi, Daniel. It's sweet of you but fuck off. How is Cashmere? Ma? She hates you and she doesn't want to see you! We can't talk with you guys. Go ahead, talk. You have one minute. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... What about dinner together? You, me and Cashmere. So that I can spend time with her outside her work, you see? My attentions towards her are good. I love her, you know. - What do we get in return? - What do you want? We're hungry. You guys will be making dinner, right? We're on it, don't worry. OK... Some tea too? I don't know which brand is the best so I took both. - You two can cook, right? - Of course, don't worry. - Oh, some oil for dinner. - Some oil? Olive oil, coffee... I think we have enough, don't you think? Parmigiano reggiano... Lemon juice too. No! Put it back! Enough! What are you doing? - Do you think I'm that stupid? - It's for dinner! You thought I'd pay for all that? And you thought we'd sell our mother for food? - Not cool. - We're done with you. And so is Ma. Piss off. I thought you were grown-ups. I was wrong. Pussy. Sons of bitches. I don't want to see him ever again. - You're really eating this here? - Got a problem with that? You're not eating this here, loser. - I've got balls! - Alright, show me then. Do it. Wait, the guard! Hide me! It's a hat. Don't make up excuses. - I'll do it! - No, I'll do it. - Let me do it. - No, I'll do it! - Give it to me, sucker! - Bite me! No, bite me! Hey! What is this? Don't! Stop! Stop! Cut your shit or I swear to God, I'll use one to hit the other. Sir! He made noise! - You say nothing? - What noise? - You lost. - I didn't, it's no game! It's not a game. You're right. But if it were, I would have won. Shut up! The both of you! If your Ma doesn't get here in five, I call my boss. We can make threats too! If you don't do 100 push-ups, we go. - OK, let's go! - Enough! Hola! Who the hell are you? Where is their mother? I'm Choukri, their best friend. - So? - I'm a magician. You said you were calling your Ma! Choukri, we got busted! Help us! I told you I'd always be there for you. - Choukri! Choukri! - Strip! Strip! Come on, you're not serious! - Strip for us, Choukri! - Alright! Alright, you got me! I'll do it! - Let's do this! - Ew, put it back on! Let's go. - OK, let's go. - No! You both stay here. And you, pay if you have the money. Pay what? What happened? - Some stuff fell because of us. - Stuff? A lot of stuff fell and someone has to pay for it! - I don't have any money! - Are you kidding me? But... I can do a magic trick for you if you want. I don't give a shit. You can't pay for them? Then I call my boss. - What is this shit? - And... - Let's get out of here! - Bye bye! - It stinks so much! - No one is leaving! Come here! You stay here and you calm the fuck down, you hear me? I'm calling my boss. Mrs Tronchu is needed downstairs, we've got unruly clients. We need assistance, quickly. - Mrs Tronchu is needed... - Quiet! I got this, Mrs Tronchu! - Release us! Set us free! - I'm on it, it's under control! Libertà! - Libertà! - What happened? - Zarma? - Mrs Tronchu, is that you? Yes. Everything's OK? Yes... Well no. Why are we in the dark? Don't panic, lights will be back in a second. Nobody move. We'll deal with you when the light is back! Zarma... Would you stop acting like kids? Shut your mouth, man. - I'll kill you! - Zarma! - Ma'am, I swear... - Nobody move! Lights will be back soon. Zarma, you're fired! - What about a thank you? - Skank you, Choukri. I've got something to tell you. I'm making a movie. - Got something to eat? - A snack? We're starving. Come on, guys. I'm serious. - You know how all movies suck now. - Yeah. Well I will make the best movie ever. - Okey dokey. - About my life. - You really think people will care? - I'll be famous, Zabulon. And my offer to you is to be famous with me. - Got something to eat? - I told you no already. I'm making this movie. When I'm a star, you'll be pissed. Could you really become a star? Frankly, yes. That's why I need you to come and get a car with me tonight. Boring. Why a car? You can't drive. In the movie, I can drive pretty well. How will you get that car? I met a nice guy who agreed to lend it to me. I've got to tell you, it's weird. - Why do you need us? - We never spend time together anymore. - Drop the hat. - Can I have it? - No, you can't. - Can I? No way. Now sit down, I have to show you something. - What... - Oh my God, it's real. Oh my God! Gimme! Please, can I borrow it? Please, can we touch it? - Please! - Just to have a look. - Please, just touch it a little bit... - Shush. You can borrow it if you come with me tonight. What? Come on! If we can borrow it, we'll come with you to get the car. - Let's cook it! - It's my pigeon. - It's not dead. - Hit the brain. I know. Don't move. Wait, are you crazy? Stop! - Don't move! - Stop! Don't shoot! The pigeon! - You shot twice, I can shoot twice too. - No! - You're a pain! - You let my pigeon go! - We said we'd take turns. - One more time, OK? - Give it to me or... - Or what? Huh? What are you going to do? As if you would kill me... So uncool. Uncool for you, but for me... It's pretty cool. Issachar! Come back! Issachar! Come back! I won't kill you! Issachar! I'm your brother! Issachar! Terrorists! Go home! Jihad! Stop! I won't kill you! I'll kick your ass, you fucking terrorist! Yeah! Let's smash his head! Fuck off, man! Relax, guys. Alright? You are so fucked. I hope you like jail. It's your fault, moron. You made me run after you. Hey! Tanguy and Laverdure! What's going on now? Hey! I'm talking to you! Damn it. What's wrong with you two? OK, where's the gun? - Where's the gun? - We have no gun! Don't lie to me! I'm not going anywhere until you give me that gun. - Got nothing else to do with your life? - Stay then. - Bye bye, man! - We've got stuff to do. Bye! Next time I see you, I'll take either one of you to the police station. Stop messing around and open the door! I'd rather die! - Cashmere! - Scram! Violeta! How are you? - Hi, Violeta! - Hi, sweeties. - How's life? - Quite nice, chilling. - Could we have some of those? - No. You look beautiful today. Thanks. Help me open the door. I've got to talk to your Ma. Why? Is there a problem? She didn't come to work today. - She didn't? - No, she didn't. - That's not reasonable. - I know. - Is that you, kids? - Yes, it's us. Violeta wants to talk to you. Well, I don't. Come on, please Ma! For us! I just want to talk to you, Cashmere. Just talk? I promise. Open the door. Open it. Open it, now! Ma, I'm opening the door! No! Don't! Zabulon, no! Don't touch that door! No! Back off! Back off! - Cashmere... - Calm down, Ma. - How are you, kids? - Fine, Ma. Where's January Jack? - Cashmere, I wanted to... - Where is he? January Jack? Did you lose him? Unfortunately, yes. - And without noticing it? - Of course not! We noticed we lost him. We're not retarded! - Shit! - We lost January Jack. Oh my god, it's the end. Fuck, I'm dying. Cashmere! What do you want? You didn't come to work. I don't want to work for you anymore, OK? - What? - I don't want to, you hear me? - Cashmere! - I'm not going! - You're coming to work! - No, I won't! - Calm down! - Bullshit! Fuck! You're so selfish, Ma! Go to work! Zabulon, you're no longer my son! - Don't say that! - Are you crazy? I'll show you crazy. If you don't get him back, I'll butcher you! - Come on, Ma! Stop! - I don't want to hear about it! If you don't get him back, you're on the street, understood? Are you done? Now let's get you to work! See you later, boys. LOST JANUARY JACK - It looks just like him. - Right. Look at mine. It's nice too. - I drew accessories. - I'm busy. - Please. - I'm busy! - Just a look! - What a pain! It doesn't look like him at all, we'll never find him with this. I lied before: your drawing sucks. - You're just jealous that I draw better. - You're a dead man! I'll stab you! No big deal. Are you looking for January Jack? Daniel, we're focused here so keep your sad life to yourself. - What are you here for? - I need to talk to her. No way, fuck off. - Let me talk to her, it's crucial. - We said no. She doesn't want to see you. Let me see Cashmere! Now! - Are you serious? - See her? - Yes! - Are you deaf? Got fat in your ears? Get the hell out of here! If you touch me, the dog is dead. I'll kill him. - I'll kill the dog! - Why do you say that? - We haven't even found him yet. - We lost him, we don't know where he is. We put up posters! Need some glasses? If you don't fix me a date with Cashmere, I'm killing January Jack. He's lost! You can't kill him if he's lost! We have to find him first! But I've got your dog! I'm the one who has him. If you don't fix me a date with your mother Cashmere... Cashmere! I love you! I love you! Are you going to pull that shit every day? Did you really bring that huge dumbass here? You said you wanted J.J. back. - Sorry, we won't do it again. - Make him go or I'll kill him. Then I'll be in jail and you two will stop ruining my life. You and your money, you make me sick! It's is for you! All for you! Stop! What are you doing? - I can't take it anymore, go away! - Get off me! Get off me! Make him leave. What's going on here? Go the fuck away! - Move! - Help! Help! Help me! Push harder... - You're a crazy fuck, aren't you? - Crazy about you. Ma! Don't stop me! Let me kill him, I'll stab him. - Yes, come to me! - I'm coming! - Come here! - Come. Stop it! Come on, let's be cool! What the fuck is this? Cashmere... I'm so sick of your shit! Violeta, please. - It's Daniel. - So? He's awful. Be honest, Violeta. Am I so awful? Honestly kids, how else can I say it? Tell your mother that you have to work in life. - Ma, you have to work. - For J.J., Ma. You have to work, Cashmere. - Shut up. - Kids! Leave now. And you, you come with me. Come on, move it! Oh, my! No way... Let me grab a bite. You dickhead! - Wow! - Hey, it's our gun! - Give it back. - Don't come closer! - Give us our gun back! - I found it, it's mine.

Back off. - Put that on, we're out of here. Hey, I'm not done making love! Shut the fuck up, Daniel! I hate you! - Give it to me. - Ma, no! - Let go of it! - Stop, Ma! - Wait, don't do that. - Turn around. Where's J.J.? - Ma, we need to go! - Where is he? - At my place! - Where do you live? Oh, God! - Answer me! - Forget about getting him back. Ma, stop! We really have to go! - Stop it! - I told you I'd kill you, pig! - I'll really do it! - Stop! Shit! Leave me alone, I'll do this by myself. - We just want to... - I don't want to see you. I'll find my dog by myself and you go back to doing your stuff. I'm serious. Stop running. - Ma, we love you. - Let us help you. It's too late. I'm not even sure I love you anymore. Cashmere! - Hey, Cashmere... - What? Your sons are morons, aren't they? True. What are you doing? Need some help? I'm looking for a guy running around in his underwear. What kind of underwear? Come on, get in. I'll drive you around. It was so good, Mum! Choukri! Choukri! - Hey! Gross! - Guys, stop! The guy won't lend me his car if you're fucking around! Alright. - Choukri? - What? You have no respect for me. You're such a pain. It's not funny anymore, I'm leaving. No! I can't leave! - I have to get the car! - Choukri? What? You want to make fun of me? Over and over again? No, I just had an idea for your movie title. I'm listening. "Choukri, the big baby in the body of an ugly guy" Sometimes I don't want to be your friend anymore.

We're coming. - So? - It was the deal. - What deal? - He needed two dancers for his video. I didn't tell you because you wouldn't have come. WHO PUT ME IN THE WELL?

I have a fucking good instinct. It runs in the family. Hey! Wait up! It's in my blood! I hope he dies. What the fuck? What is this? - Stop it! Stop! - What? Do you want to die? I want my music video! I'll do whatever you want! Sorry, I'll do whatever you want! Only Choukri can shoot my video. - Do you know where he lives? - Yes. Come here. - Come here! - Alright, OK! OK, OK, stop it. Get in the car! Start the engine. Right now. I don't know how to drive. Any last wish? - I would like... - Hurry! I... I wish I knew how to drive. I can't do it. You! You're a dead man! Get it? You shouldn't have attacked Zarma! - I'll cut you into pieces! - That's him! Go on the other side, let's turn that twat over! Move, move! Motherfuckers! - Take that! - Let's go! Let's fuck him! - God! - Let me go! Bastards! Go fuck yourself! The whole neighbourhood is going to fuck you! I'm here for January Jack. Good, then. It means you know where your mum is. Yes. So? She's in London. - If I find out you lied to me... - Violeta. - I swear, it's the truth. - So sweet. Are you protecting Ma? Are you protecting her? Are you? Are you? I love you. Every time I see you, I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm in love with you. Get out. Get out before I smash your head. Come, January Jack. What the hell? - Zabulon? - Issachar? Have you found her? What? Have you found Ma? - No, you? - No. Cashmere, what happened? Are you OK? Cédric, I messed up. Why did I ever leave you? You said I was boring. What did you do with the money I gave you? I did as I said, I bought a ticket for London. What are you doing? I need something else. - What do you need? - I want love. Cashmere, we shouldn't do that. It's not my fault if I love you. Cashmere, look at me. Let's go. - My darlings. - Ma? Where have you been? I'm here, that's what matters. How nice to come home and have dinner ready. Sweetie, can you fix me a plate? Mmh, it smells very good. Thanks. - I had a revelation. - Again? Shut up. I realised I was lucky to have you both. That's all that counts in this shitty world. But you didn't want to see us! I changed my mind, I came back. From now on, we'll spend all our time together. All our time together? Great. We'll go on a great trip together. - Do you like it? - To London? - What? - What? What about Choukri? We can't leave him alone. Yes, what about Choukri? We can't leave him alone. I love Choukri, but... When I die, you'll regret not having spent more time with me. Of course, we want to be with you. It's going to be great, we'll have a big family trip. Just the three of us! What am I saying? The four of us, with January Jack. We're going on holidays. Aren't we, doggie? Right? January Jack? Where are you? Have you found him? Yes. January Jack? Yes, he's good, isn't he? He's dead. So... We thought we might as well eat him. It's tasty, isn't it? - Ma? - Are you OK? - Calm down. - What is it, Ma? Ma! Ma, are you OK? - Ma? - Are you OK? Ma? Ma? - What is it? - She's dead. That can't be! Ma? - Ma, wake up! - Ma, are you dead? Ma? Don't die, please! Come on Ma, please! - Ma, please be alive! - Don't die! Wake up, Ma! Wake up, Ma! Wake up! Come on! I told you she's dead! You killed her! It was your idea to cook J.J., you killed Ma! If you hadn't killed him, I wouldn't have! It's your fault! Stop coming up with excuses! Sorry, Ma, sorry! Choukri, we killed Ma! - Help us burry her. - I don't give a damn, get out! - Why? - Corentin left a message. He's not dead at all and he wants to cut me into pieces. - Of course he is. - You fucking lied to me! Choukri, Ma is dead! Sorry about your mum, but I'm angry. Whatever. You're not cool, Choukri. Wait up. - What? - OK, I'll help you. - Too late. - Please. What do we get in exchange? She was there! - How so? - We had put her in a trolley. Fuck, shit! - She might be alive. - No. She's alive! - No, it can't be! - She's alive! Isn't that her? Fuck this guy! That's my stuff! What is this? It's a nightmare. Where's Choukri? Oh no! They ate him! Let us through! Ew, so disgusting! Back in line, there is enough for everyone. - Wait your turn, please. - Shut up! - Fuck, not them. - What's going on? Like everyone, if you want to fuck, it's five euros. And you wait for your turn. - Oh my God! - Those bastards! - They fucked our deceased mother! - Move! Stop, stop everything! Stop! We want our Ma back! People have paid! Paid for what? Are you sick? It's our mother! Stop making love to her like that! I'll give you a cut. - We don't care about the money! - There's 1,000 euros in there. What? 1,000 €. - 1,000 €? - Yes, 1,000 €! That's tempting. But that's sick... Let's do heads or tails. I'll explain. If you win, you get your mum back and I give you 1,000 €. If you lose, I keep your mum, but you still get 1,000 €. So it's a win-win for you. We are going to win? Win-win, yes. For your mum, it's 50-50. - We win, of course. - 50-50. - I'll throw the coin. - No, no. I need an innocent hand. No... Ah, you! - Me? - Yes, you. Alright, tails for Mr Tramp. Heads for the deceased's kids. - Tails! - Yes! Ma! Come back here! MOTHER SCHMUCKERS And yet another shitty day. A SCREAMING MAN! Good morning, Messrs Directors. - We have something to tell you, Choukri. - You are fired! I shouldn't have tasted the delights of that old pal Satan. I had to pull myself together. No! I decided to go have sex with my wife. Honey... I need your love. Don't you ever touch my tit, ever! But I love you! I love you, I want to be with you all the time. I'm leaving you, you're impossible to live with. No, I'm leaving you. Get lost! Get out of my sight! Get out of here! Special edition! Special edition! Jihad strikes again! Choukri's entire family dies in a terrorist attack! This time, it's over. They took everything from me. I couldn't see any other solution. - Don't do it, Choukri! - Life's too beautiful! I don't care! But Choukri, we love you! Goodbye, my friends. I'll protect you from up there. THE END THE END? This... is my life.
