May dream, may dream, may dream, you can dream, you can dream about a bluebird, bluebird, bluebird, bluebird in the sky, fairy tales in the world full, everything comes true all the same, everything is colorful no trace, just not the secret. The whirlwinds whirled, the whirlwinds whirled- there was fire, black wings, black wings, black wings- formidable horse. In fairy tales, good wins evil, in fairy tales heroes always lucky, it happens in life and no, maybe this is the secret. The sun laughs, the sun laughs, the sun laughs, the shadow is dancing, morning wake up, morning wake up, morning wake up new day, in the morning any eccentric will believe, in a life without sun no way, the sun without there is no way of a fairy tale, maybe this is the secret, isn't it secret. This is our city. Our city is the most beautiful, although I have not been to others cities. Our city has everything: the sea, and mountains, and a whole forest of towers, and a boulevard. I would go to the boulevard, but my mother alone does not start up. We go to the boulevard on Sundays with Dad. Here is my dad, he's a musician he even composes music himself , but earlier he was a military man and rode a horse, very close to Chapaev, he wore a hat with a star and a checker. Eh, dad would be a military man he would give me a checker to hold and then, everyone would envy me, he I would definitely give me a checker to hold, he is very kind, my dad. And this is our yard, see him? I would never leave here if they hadn’t called me. This is Boba my brother just a week ago, on May 31, 41, he is 4 years old. These are my friends, the Ismailov brothers: this is Rafis, I am sitting on the same desk with him , this is Ramis, this is Rasim, this is the youngest Rais, And this is my mom and the mother of the Ismailov brothers, aunt Fatma, they love to talk, they can talk for hours about the same thing very strange adults. And this is Uncle Ali, dad of brothers Rafis, Ramis, Rasim and Raisa. So, at 7 o'clock at the maiden tower. Listen, Ali, what about the tickets? Volodya invited everyone. And who is he, this Volodya? Volodya? Volodya is my neighbor. And this is old man Liverpool, daddy's best friend, his mom called him Liverpool for the fact that he sings all the time: oh Liverpool, Liverpool, Liverpool. He sailed all over the world and then came to our city and stayed here forever. And Masha and I signed up today at the pioneers' house. What are you doing? What are you doing? Clement, Clement, beautiful sonatin, Clementius. As a child, I played Clementia's sonatinas. Played? Nobody bothers Boba, does not make Clementius play, in general, he feels good, but I feel bad. Well, everything, played everything. One more time. I won't do it anymore. Oh please. I said I won't. You watch me I'll grind you into powder. Oh, don't do that. I studied I played the piano for five or six hours, every day, right after civil war, I worked, and he? But after all, I'll grind it into powder! He won't grind me to dust he always says that when he's angry he even says so to mom. How can he powder us erase, especially since he's our dad? I will not play, and that's it! We'll see. You are welcome. We'll see. I'd rather eat borscht again than play sonatina Clementia. I don’t know this girl. When did she arrive? Let's go to Uncle Gaucher! Urrah !!! Hooray !! I lead everyone to Uncle Gaucher. He's very good, he lends everything to us, and then dad pays him - so good. Daddy told him so: let them whatever they want, as much as they want. The kids need candy. And me! Take it. Take it! And me! Take it, Masha. Yes Yes. Berry! I've already eaten everything! And I've already eaten everything. Sorry, but we didn't have enough.

Ah, so I am to blame in all yes? With such a person, with my aching heart, I can not. Petya, give me some water. Don't, don't you dare let all the neighbors say ... I'm going to conduct. No, let all the neighbors say. What will they say? Let them tell you. We'll have to borrow the pants from the neighbors. I wonder who will give you his pants? Everyone treats me well everything, exactly everything. Liverpool for example no, I'd better take the pants from Ali, he treats me well too. Here, Petya is your dad, don't be like that, be smart and then, just the same, you will go in patches somewhere out there to conduct. Petya, come with me for my pants, oh ... Stop it, you. Oh... This has never happened before my dad is on the radio now it will be announced. Now. Well done, Volodya. Yes, for a person like Volodya, I would love to drink I'm always ready to drink to him.

Why is it sad. when I'm not sad at all? Who will you be? The commander. Again war! Volodya, would you give it all up. What to quit? Well, this one, a symphony. But I feel: this is not what it is, that's not right here but then ... Come on, if it's not that. Well, it's not all the same. Well does not matter. How is it all the same?

So, I swam on this dove, on this old vessel, for example, how is it sung? Fifteen men for a dead man 's chest y, great song! Oh how interesting! I wish I was in Africa crocodiles, by the way, and crawl, but our lads, ohohoho, they have cards in their hands, guys from our galoshes ... from which galoshes? It's not your mind , yeah, so, from our galoshes, in Africa. Enough. Why am I not tired. I understood everything. Well, well, let your children come always, please, they need candy and others sweets, bank account. Thank. Thanks. How do you live like this? How? For example, you don't have a buffet. That is how, and what is this? This old box? AND? what? No, I don’t understand, because you have the cards in your hands This I will not understand. I will never understand, how, how can you live like that? How? Well, well, like that. And I told him. After all, you and cards in hand. Sure. Newest I saw a buffet in one place. I wish you well. Of course I don't care, but I would be in your place .. What would you be in our place? I'd buy excellent buffet. What else? Would buy excellent chandelier. After all, the cards are in your hands. Tell me please, Why are the cards in my hands? I didn't understand at all. Oh, you're a musician so to speak, aesthetically musical movement of the soul. Am I correct? Yes, yes, right. I am speaking correctly. I understand all this I know your brother. Are you a cultured person or not, tell me? A cultured person. You have money. And you are not spending them there. Not there, you know? Not there. They are not going there. Not there. Think, I wish you well. I wish you well. Well, go to sleep. And my dad is sleeping. He no longer hears anything. He will never know it. So will spend money not there. He sleeps and hears nothing. And I forgot what I heard. What to do - such a person is my dad. What a good family. And Gosh .. How wonderful. And dad is asleep. There was bottomless bottomless sky. Yes Yes Yes Yes. This is exactly the sky. I remember. Gosha was there too. This Gosha is just a chatterbox. Nothing like this. And where was Gosha? In Africa. Yes, he was not anywhere. Well, how is it possible? He told so interesting. You listened .. And in general he is a wonderful person. Well, how can you? I completely forgot: he really was there. Take it easy. And thank God! And I tell you the same thing. I am still worried. Hitler eats up Europe. Yes, his appetite is great. Ah! Gosha is a wonderful person, he was not only in Africa, in Australia. And this girl I don’t know, I don’t know. Everyone needs music everyone needs music crocodiles, by the way, and crawl, by the way, they crawl I do not know. Is there soon? Now, now, well, what are you standing for? It would be nice now go to Moscow. which Moscow? No, well, can you imagine I go out in Moscow, at the Kazansky railway station, would that be bad? Oh, oh, I don't understand anything. My dad was born in Moscow , he wants to go to Moscow, he hasn't been there for a long time, he wants to go to Moscow every year but mom doesn't want to, she was born here and she loves the dacha, and I love the dacha, who doesn't love the dacha? I love Moscow too, who doesn't love Moscow? So, what to do: you also want to go to the dacha. Where's the pillow and the kettle? I'm in a hurry. And don't forget to close the door. I'm in a hurry! And so do we. Hey! You will lose the lid. I'm tired. You see. I see, I see everything. Get away, it's a car, not a wagon. Why did she put on such a bow , also to me, what is the bow to me? Forgotten the bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Have you forgotten anything else? Looking for the deaf! Nothing, nothing, let's go! Ptu, shaitan! Goodbye! Goodbye! Up to date, a girl with a bow! It's a pity that we're driving during the day it would be better at night, then our headlights would be on, and it's light during the day, that's not bad either, it is very difficult to say which is better. It's great that we are in the country, soon the grapes will ripen, dad said we will eat it as much as we want. Fire, fire, fire! What a boy there, black, I will certainly tan like him. And daddy returned to town nothing can be done, our dad has a job, he will arrive only in the evening, and we will go to the station to meet him. But tomorrow? Tomorrow tomorrow is Sunday dad will be with us all day. Soon all the grapes will ripen, the figs will ripen, the quince will ripen, I even wrote a verse: the sun is shining and the sea is sparkling, and quince and figs ripens and grows, and grapes grow, how glad I am, how glad I am, how glad I am. There daddy, daddy! What's with dad? Interesting, to whom is he telling all this? I love summer, wonderful summer here, and the sun is wonderful here, and people but I still want to go to Moscow. On, well, from time to time. There is also the sun there. Sure. Well, not that many. Some kind of daddy weird today, what's wrong with him? To me too, I thought of yelling. We can all shout. A man is talking to you so you listen, don't yell. To me, too, broke. Well, what are you staring at? I haven't written good music. This is not what it is here- not that well, right here, here and there, here and there! But all the same still not that. And why? I don't know myself. Although I've always wanted even now very much, really want to. Volodya! And the sun, the sun is here of course, and there, not like that quantity. What about you? Nothing. Liverpool and I for success, we are not just. For what success? Well, how? I.e for success. Dad! Dad, look! One two Three. Dive! One, two, three - dive! Hooray !! War! War! War! Here is a sly boy! Yesterday he also shouted: fire, fire, and there was no fire. Fascist robbers, without declaring war, invaded our land. We didn't want this war it was imposed on us. We are leaving the dacha. I'm very sorry. Sorry grapes- he was not ripe yet. Poor sea. And we are leaving. Our dad is going to the front tomorrow. We will accompany him and now we are going back to the city. Stupid wind damn him. Poorly, when you go and see nothing. It's right. Not very good and when it's cold. Also bad. Also bad. And when it shakes. It is truth too. Why do you answer like that? How? Well, somehow. Boring. What's fun for you? No, for some reason I'm not having fun. So for some reason, brother, I am not having fun. Because the night? And the night and the war together. But we will win, right? But how. Eh, it's still interesting : planes, tanks .. Fuck, bah, doo-doo-doo! Well, well, well, don't wave your hands - you will fall. Will they give you a helmet? They will give, they will give everything. Is it steel or iron? What do you think? Steel. Then you wear it, since it is all steel. Required. Our dad just with us said goodbye. Can you hear his steps? He'll come down now to the front. Goodbye dad! Goodbye dad! Goodbye, dad. Goodbye, dad. Goodbye, dad. But! Dad left. I left yesterday. To the front. This is how our phone rings in the morning. Everyone asks: left? My daddy left quickly no one had time to say goodbye to him. Calls and calls. But. Is your father at home? No, he left. When is he coming? Not soon. Where did he go? To the war. What war? That you don't know that there is a war going on now? Ugly of him. Ugly. Why is it ugly? He owes me, but he left. What should? Something should. Who is speaking? Didn't know, bro? Well, okay, be healthy! Now I found out. This is Uncle Gosha, I used to love him Yes, but that was before. Hello! There is no dad, he went to the front. Oh, that's how, uh-huh! What you need? I need Petya. Petya is listening to you. Daddy listens to you too. Where are you, dad? Near. How is it at the front? Well, we are not yet at the front, we're just on the way to the front, our train is in Balajar, Well, how are you there, is everything all right? Of course it's okay. Where is mom? She left. It's a pity, well, okay, I kiss you all, be young, do not quarrel with Bob and listen to your mom, goodbye. Goodbye. So dad is very close to us, that is, at the first station, there is probably a whole military train, dad was not a military man when he left and dad didn't have a gun, and now he probably in helmet and a pistol on the side; look at dad, but the Balajars are very close that is, just a stone's throw. Can you sit quietly or not? Where to sit? Well, just sit, do nothing, can you or not? What? Nothing, can you just sit? Why? Because I'm going to my dad. And I want to see my dad. Well, then get ready, live. We broke piggy banks, but we will buy tickets and go like real passengers. In Makhachkala, allocate one person from each wagon to get food. Are you lost again? We see off dad arrived. Our dad is the captain he fought with Chapaev together, what is his name? Last name, huh? Ivanov Vladimir Ivanovich. Comrades, who knows Captain Ivanov? Captain Ivanov? Kaptin Ivanov! Captain Ivanov !!!!!!! On the wagons! Look, dad there! Dad! Hooray, tank! Tank, urrah! Hooray, hooray !!! Dad! Stop, stop, where are you going? A machine! You guys what? We're nothing, we're going home. And the kid what? Our dad left in the tank. He lies everything, in any tank he is did not leave, he left in the carriage. So, where's mom? Mom is at home with us. Oh, that's how. Our dad is the captain of the Red Army, he and Chapaev fought together. How, right next to Chapaev and fought, right? But what, separately or what? Of course, nearby. Interesting. What, don't you believe? Very much in vain and dad was also a sailor, only that was long ago. And was he a sailor? Since. In general, my dad- musician. He even composes music himself, only he is not very successful. And mom says it's not worth it since he's not doing very well. What do you think is worth it? Well, you’re all lying! Small, but a lot to lie. And you ask Liverpool. Who? They said: at Liverpool. Who is he? When you arrive, we will introduce you to him. With whom? Yes with Liverpool. So is it a parrot or something? Believe it or not. As you wish. Well, get into the car. Let's find out there. We have a new teacher - Pal Palych, some professor or academician concurrently. Now that your fathers, your elders brothers fight with the enemy, what is required of you? What is required of you take from me the knowledge which I have accumulated over the years. What is required of me? And of course it is required of me to convey to you the knowledge that I accumulated over these long years. Your front is here- these desks. These are your combat positions. Only by my studies, not antics and not laziness you will help the front, to your fathers and your older brothers. Our enemy is not only Hitler, this is not only fascist rabble, comprehended on us. Our enemy is laziness. Yes, yes, and this is the antics, and irresponsibility and unscrupulousness and carelessness, and lack of will, and thoughtlessness, etc, etc Anu-ka, come here! What do I see? I see there our land. Your fathers and your older brothers fight to the death for this land, and they didn't deserve these, if I may say so, gifts in the form, as you yourself understand, twos and ones. I AM I can hope i can think what will it be with us the rarest phenomenon in our practice with you. Can I hope? You can! You can hope! You can! Turn! You can! You can! I already got a deuce although he tried his best. I wrote off almost everything from Rafis. What if tomorrow a letter comes from dad and dad will ask how I studied, what will I answer? An urgent need to correct the deuce. I explained everything to Pal Palych. Yes .. Seven mistakes in one statement, but there is a way out: take this story at home read it once or twice, but no more, then close the book and write, just mind not looking and do not look, and do not write off, got it? And who will look, I drop in or don't I drop by? Nobody will watch. How so? After all, I will drop in. I don’t think so. Why then? Why, why. Because honesty. Such an agreement. How can you watch? Then it will not be fair. Wow. I believe you. I trust you. That's all, dear Pyotr Vladimirovich. That's right, but who will know? You can assume that our conversation is over. Of course, of course, of course, of course. I read the story only twice. I never opened the book again although I really wanted to. And don't shout too much in the yard: Petit has a presentation today. I wrote with difficulty even in class it was easier to write. There could be written off from Rafis or ask Pal Palych, but here everything was for honesty, and I wrote everything as I remember it. Man you i see honest. So write to your father. But what about the deuce? Well, that's not the point. You can consider that you have corrected. How do you know if I'm honest or not honest? Darling, you can see it right away this is evident from the presentation. Well, go for a walk. Who will take? And my dad killed the most important fascist in one shot. Hitler? Hitler is sitting in the palace, how can you kill him there? And then daddy how began to scribble from the machine: tra-ta-ta-ta-ta. He stood like that and fired. How did you shoot? In the head. And did not bend over? No matter how it is! And at the front, everyone bends down. And he did it on purpose. What for? He wanted to deceive everyone. Everyone bends down, but he doesn't. Only the panties bend over. Nothing cowards, I know. Right! Untie us! And then he sees- someone directly from a machine gun into it aiming, he just bent down. All the bullets are missing. That's great! And then like a somersault to the side! Well, get up! Is it hard to play so hard to stay clean, cultured and tidy children? Moreover, your father is at the front. Well, I understand he's small, but you're big, right? Come here! There you are money. On! You better go to the cinema. Urrah! Dad! Dad! Don't bother watching! Well what can dad be here? Very possibly in vain Are you citizens, or maybe they saw your father, a film actor? Well, what kind of movie actor can there be, when is this natural movie? Maybe, maybe they saw the father of not a film actor, but maybe is there a real natural frontline? Yes, well, stop you talk, well, what a disgrace? It's true? Did you see your father there? Well yes. Well yes. An interesting case! Comrades, the son saw his father in the cinema, and father at the front. This is, one might say, an exceptional case. Well done, yes. And what is that noise? Yes, these boys now saw in the magazine father, and father at the front, can you imagine? It's true? Is this your father? Of course, father! Of course. That's what, dear, I ask you any day at any hour, day, night, please! Look! Dad. Oh. Call more, call everyone! Let them watch! Go! Faster! Faster! Come on in! Come on in! Come on in! Come on in! Faster! Dad! Well, what to tell dad? Tell me that when I grow up I will come to the rescue too! Honey, then the war will end. Or it may not end. Why am I going? So what, what do you eat? You, uncle, mean nothing. One does not mean but with dad I mean. Olya. What did you drink again? I don't drink now. I can't drink. I drink when I'm in a great mood and now... It's good that you don't drink. My mom is very happy. What does your mom have to do with it? Liverpool is now on duty every day on the roof for all residents of the house. I would also, of course, be on duty, but for some reason children cannot go to the roof. Now Liverpool will know me. I know it. I'm not really afraid of him. Well, Petya, march home. You can, but I can't? I am a tough person. March home! Understand me if you can. There is no father - he has blossomed. You chase me in vain maybe the Germans are on us are coming? Do you think not? Of course they come. Something is not visible. God forbid you to see them. Who will let them in here? Nobody will let you in, so Uncle Ali went. She and dad will give them life. God grant that Volodya returned, God forbid! For some reason he won't come back? It will come back will definitely return. Liverpool, Liverpool ... Why do people fight? War... This is not happiness start a war. Is this reasonable? No son, this is not reasonable. And, meanwhile, people- the most intelligent creatures on Earth. So the fascists are not people. Petya. Get out of here. It's not interesting, I want it too. Both march from here, I told whom? Uncle, can you eat a cactus? What? Clementia, Clementia. Yes, at least Bach, Mozart, hello, Valentina Nikolaevna, Oh! Hello, Olympiada Vasilievna. Here, I brought the guys here. What is it? Here are two loaves, let the children take it, it's bread. What are you, so much and so dear. I'll bring you more, for free. I went to your house and Fatma said that you are at the bazaar. Yes, you see. What do you hear from Volodya? He doesn't write again. Well, nothing, write. Valentina Nikolaevna, can I lend you some money? No, I won't be able to give it back soon. Don't worry, then somehow. But I can work with your Misha music, I can, let it come whenever you want. What are you, then, when Volodya returns. If only he came back. He will return, he will certainly return. You will write, hello to him from me do not forget. he is a golden man, Volodya. In general, I love your whole family. Our family really wherever, there is nothing to sell. Well, don't be discouraged. How can you not get upset here? After all, every decent family in case of war or some other bad case, have something to sell and we just have nothing, you know, how not to get upset? I need to be upset. Oh, what do you want, upset, Olympiada Vasilievna, dear? All Gosh. What, Gosh? I really like your Gosha, he's so energetic. When the war started Gosha sent all the things all the furniture somewhere to go to relatives for safety, he was afraid of raids, but the opposite happened: all his things are there burned out and the closets were bombed. Oh, what a shame, ayyay. I'm not upset about things what are my things I'm upset for Gosha what kind of man is he You know he probably just got it wrong, sure. Ah, he was wrong. Goodbye kids goodbye, Valentina Nikolaevna. Goodbye. I beg you very much will write hello from me to Volodya. Required. Just don't forget, be sure. Required. And don't be discouraged.

And me Petya, and these are my friends: Rafis, Ramis and Rasim, and the smallest Rais stayed at home with my brother Boba, we ran away from them. And this is my brother Oleg. Let's live with us here, if it suits you. Thank you, we are temporary, wife stayed in Moscow, and I came here with the guys , I have a shoot, we were promised, but not right away. Nothing, nothing, settle down. Then I'm at the train station for the luggage, Igor, Oleg let's go! Are you crazy? After all, they are on the street, in the open air, yes if dad were here he would have come to us before brought, I know. What's true is true. No, did you hear what my son did ? And he heard and saw, in my opinion he did right. Why all this is needed, I do not understand. In my opinion also his father would have done. There are no letters from Volodya. Where do we put them? How where? Igor and Oleg on our bed, and Boris Lvovich to you. Right! Well, how are you? Petya, is it fun? Very funny. Play us, old man. I'm not an old man. It does not matter. Liverpool? Shh! Play something just not Clementia. What your heart desires. Come on. But you, you, me .. But won't you let me down? And my dad is not a kind dad. He will never return. The sun laughs, the sun laughs the sun laughs - dances shadow, morning will wake up, morning wake up, morning wake up - new day. Any eccentric will believe in the morning in life without the sun it is impossible in any way. There is no road to the sun without a fairy tale, maybe this is the secret - isn't this secret?
