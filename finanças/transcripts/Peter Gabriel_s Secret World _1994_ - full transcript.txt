Come talk to me. Ah, please talk to me. Won't you please come talk to me, just like it used to be? Come on. Come talk to me. Don't you ever change your mind? Now your future's so defined, and you act so deaf, so blind. Come on. Come talk to me. Come talk to me. Come talk to me.

I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes. In your eyes. In your eyes. [crowd clapping to the rhythm] [music playing] Love, I don't like to see so much pain. So much wasted, and this moment keeps slipping away. I get so tired of working so hard for our survival. I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive. But all my instincts, they return. And the grand facade, so soon will burn. Without a noise-- without my pride, I reach out from the inside. Oh. Whoa. Whoa. In your eyes, the light, the heat. In your eyes, I am complete. In your eyes, I see the doorway. In your eyes, a thousand churches. In your eyes, the resolution. In your eyes, of all the fruitless searches. --your eyes. In your eyes, I see the light and the heat. In your eyes. Oh, I want to be that complete. In your eyes. I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes. In your eyes. In your eyes. In your eyes.
