Mom? Let's go. Hey, ho. Please, what's up? Check out my eyebrows. Just did 'em up. What do you think? Pretty sick, huh? What are you looking at? Just scrolling. I just haven't looked at this since, like, forever. She looked so happy. Yeah, well. Things don't always look the way they are, right? Hey, how about I come hang out with you - after practice tomorrow? - I don't know. - You have work, right? - Yeah. Let's just stick to Saturday, okay? Okay. Bye, babe. The next one is my second favorite. I was 11 when I started at this school. I wasn't used to, like, being bullied, being left out and I felt pretty terrible. My sister, Rosie's not home that often so I can't really talk to her about it. So today I choreographed a dance with my friends and it was pretty fun. I choreographed most of it and the music was kinda like modern music and with a mix of jazz... I'll text you soon as I arrive. I left money for food on the table. - I love you. - You're okay. I'm gonna be back before you know it. Are you gonna go in tomorrow? Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. I'm not going. We can't afford for you to get fired from this one. I'm fine. Well, yeah. Listen, I'm okay if you wanna skip tomorrow. I love you. Yeah, Mom. You better hide the key to this shit better. Hey, Lupindrea, she's so dumb she makes me laugh. - My bitchoo. - Hi. Okay. Hey, Boo. I already know her one, right now, on the agenda. Should I invite Rory on Saturday? - Hell, yeah. - No. Come on. - He looks like a felon. - What felon? Hear me out. He's a bit of a daddy, though. - He's like a hot, hot daddy. - No. Like, he can be my baby daddy. Yeah. No, he's a total, total scumbag, He's so hot. We'll we order Netflix and chill with him, you know? - She's so vanilla. - Yeah, Drea, you're so boring. Okay, Rosie, you're a fucking virgin so you don't know what you're talking about, okay? All right, well so are you. So you can shut the fuck up. God, two virgins. What am I doing with both of you? - Go away. You know you love us. - I do. I made this one with my own little hands and I was feeling okay. I started selling these online. And then, when he said he was gonna buy one from me, I got really creeped out because I don't want him meeting me anywhere. I don't want him to have my information. I just want him to leave me alone. What if he comes to my house? I've been doing a lot of art work and so far, I've made this and this, these two. And I've been doing more paintings and drawings so... I went on LiveTV and he was on there again. I just didn't know what to do. What was that? Sorry, we were just trying to say hi. This is Rory. He lives up in the canyon. Hey. You're not coming to school tomorrow, are you? Nope, just chilling. Okay. Take a fucking shower. These are, like, mountains with the sea and stuff. These pages are linked. This must be his account on MeNow. - Andrew Tames Unicorns. - Oh, creepy. Hella creepy. I told Rory that you wanted his help. He said that he's on to do whatever he can. - Want me to text you his info? - I don't know. People on here don't even need an email to register so it's, like, super anonymous. - He can program and shit. - That's a great recommendation. Hey, you never know. Okay, what's his number? You could set up a profile and if he, you know, contacts you, you can try to see if you can track it. Okay. How about this? That'll work. Okay, here goes. You, uh... You gonna come in to school tomorrow? Maybe, I don't know I'll snoop around, see what type of dirt I can dig up. - Thanks. - No worries. See you around. So all I could find were dead ends. This guy definitely doesn't want to be found. His IP address bouncing around all these weird European websites and, uh... Yeah, just some, some real dark net stuff. Okay, thanks. I'll try to find him, you know. See if anything else comes up but, you know. Why are you trying to find this guy now? You know what, just forget it. It's... Just don't worry about it. I got it. No, no, I'm almost done here so I can pick him up. - I... - I'll call you right back. Yes? Um... there is this man that's been bothering my sister - and I want to help. - Okay. How old is your sister? Thirteen. Or she was, was thirteen. - Is she local? - Yeah. Amelia. Amelia Danvers. I'm really sorry for your loss, okay. - I have to go... - No, I have all of this. Um... - You know... - It's... I can't do anything with this. All the other information went up the chain. I'm really sorry. - You can't be in here... - Maybe you can look at it. You should hang on to that. Okay? So, thanks for coming by. Can't you, at least, find his address? There has to be some sort of law. You would think so, but it's not up to us. Unless you have some new kind of evidence. Listen, he would have to, basically, walk in here and confess, in order for me to do anything. No. Tomorrow, bud. I dare you. I double dog dare you to do it. Okay. These... Sorry that I took so long. See you next time. Well, you gotta break some eggs. Yeah, I... Oh, shit, I got... I got a call. Okay, yeah. Yeah. I can be there in... Okay, bye. Who are you? Rosie, you need to be careful. Yeah, girl, he is a sex offender. Wait, he was taking pictures of little kids, so. Rose, it should be illegal. Yeah, well it's not illegal. I looked it up. Yeah, are you sure it's him though? Oh, it's him. Yo. Pass that bitch over here. Yeah! One each ladies. Chug it. Oh! God, I'm glad we missed that. Those dumb bitches will do anything to be popular. I'm just focusing on getting the fuck out of high school. Hey, dudes, more than five people will be raped in college. - People or, like, girls? - Girls. But, is it rape if they don't remember? Okay, not funny. - At all. - Okay. Listen, dudes report it even less than girls. What? Rape dudes, like how? How do you rape a dude? - By other dudes? - Yeah, I guess. Bitch, don't kill my vibe. You're so brandy mouthing. 'Bitch, don't kill my vibe.' Bitch, don't kill my vibe. My vibe, bitch. No means yes! Hey, dream boyfriend rapey enough for you? You killed it. The future rulers of the universe.

Pharma. - Yeah, yeah, you know, like some Percocets, Vicodin, Marijuana, you know. I wish. So, Rory is kind of a girl's name. - It's unisex. - Unisex? Who says that? It's like from a 1970s sitcom. So, what's your deal? Where does Rosie see herself in four years? Not selling fucking boner pills. All right, this is good. I gotta get going. You sure? Yeah, I got a lot of stuff I gotta do, so. Okay. Well... Hey, do you want to see something cool? No. Like, I really got to get going. No, I mean, not right now, obviously, but like tomorrow night. It's the full moon and... You'll like it. It won't disappoint, I promise you. Fuck. Fuck, Fuck. Damn. We're gonna make a deal, okay? You know someone's gonna find out that I'm missing. - Ow! Stop! Stop! - We're gonna see who you are. We're gonna do the ten questions. - What. Ouch. What? - It's an asshole filter. Maybe you'll pass, maybe you'll fail. If you pass, you'll get the benefit of the doubt and some food. But if you fail... I don't know who you think I am but... you have the wrong person. Fuck, this is crazy. Stop. Please, please, please. Do you think girls are just as smart as guys? Yes. Do you think it's okay for a girl to be your boss? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Have you ever cheated on your girlfriend or wife? Come on. - Fucking fine. - No, no. What's the youngest girl you have ever jacked off to? How old were you? Have you ever hit a girl? Do you think a girl should have to ask her boyfriend or husband permission to do anything or go anywhere or buy anything? - Stop it. - Or have a fucking abortion? Stop it. Stop it. Stop! Do you think girls are funny? Hilarious. Do you think it's okay to have sex with a really drunk girl? No. Do you think if a girl dresses really sexy - then she's asking for it? - No. That's more than ten. Yeah, that's right, asshole. You are an asshole, for sure. What do you want from me? - I want you to tell the truth. - I am. Well, if you give me something, I'll give you something. I'll give you this nice dry blanket for a story. Okay? Okay. It just has to be something real. - What kind of story? - You choose. How about you tell me the worst thing you have ever done? Or about the saddest day of your life? No bullshit. No bullshit. I remember when I was your age... my girlfriend and I... were having kind of a tough time... and, uh, she had always wanted to be a model. This one day I saw this poster for this guy who was looking for models nearby. We get to this house and she went inside. She took a couple of photos, I guess. Then came out and she... she got all kind of fucked up. She had, she had 50 bucks so we blew it on weed and beer. And then, later... she told me the guy... made her get naked, sign something... open her legs. I got so mad. I didn't... I didn't know what to do. I didn't do anything. I was... And then, about six months later... she saw it in a magazine. She wasn't even legal, that was the joke. We stayed together for a while, you know, for the kid. - You didn't say it. - What? Give me permission? - You didn't give me permission. - No. You're some fucked up, twisted little bitch. I'm gonna take a break. And just let you think about what you did. Please... I'll give you a pizza and a bucket to shit in if you put this dildo up your ass. Fuck you. You can only use a dick to punish a dick. Fuck you. Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? - Not hungry, perv? - Of course, I'm fucking hungry. So put this up your ass and you'll eat a delicious pizza. I'm not putting anything up my fucking ass. You watch disgusting porn with fucking girls putting all sorts of shit up themselves, don't you? You think they like it? Here's a news flash, no one likes to swallow. You know what? Just... say I'm sorry. Just say, I'm sorry for what I did. And then you can have your stupid pizza. I'm sorry. - I'm so, so sorry. - Thank you. If you let me out of here, I won't tell anyone. I'm on probation and I've just... had some needs that... I understand... you wanna hurt somebody. I won't hurt you, I promise. I like you. I don't care if you like me. What? What was in that pizza? I want you to know how serious I am. I want you to admit what you have done. To confess... ...or die. Just say you're sorry... like you mean it. Say it like you're apologizing to someone you love. - Say it really nice. - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for what I did. - Say it. - I'm sorry... I need the bucket. I need the buck... I need the fucking bucket. Confess, come on. Just tell me what you did. Tell me what you did to her. Tell it to the camera, Come on, baby. Just say it. Hey. Thanks for the coffee but fuck you. You think I'm stupid. All I want is to help you, to understand. I know. We're gonna talk. I'm gonna show you some pictures, okay? We're just gonna see what you think. You're just a normal guy, just doing what everyone else does, right? Okay. Take a look at this. What do you think? Is it hot? Is this hot to you? - No, I... - Maybe this is more your speed. Looks like you're really enjoying this. What the fuck is this about? Oh, God. Come on. What? You don't like it anymore? Now that you don't have a choice, you don't like it? Neither did she. Come on, I told you, remember yesterday, that I'm gonna take you out today, somewhere cool? No, I don't. I forgot. Well, I got some beer. We can chill here. - No. No, no, no, let's just go. - All right. What is this place? I guess it's an old mansion this family used to own. It's used to be, like, their ski lodge. But, the family died... and people stopped looking after it. Do you trust me? Uh... Sure, 'course. You already got me. You should watch out for me, though. You should watch out for me. Scared you. Mm-hm. So, um, do you live with your mom or your dad? I live with da... My mom right now. And your dad? Yeah, he moved back from Kentucky over a year ago. My dad is, like, he's long gone. You chilly? I guess there's always next time, right? Come here. I'm not gonna hurt you. I smell bullshit. What's so funny? Let me go. Do you wanna fuck me? 'Cause we can, right here. What? Am I too old? I'm sorry. Whatever happened to you... your family. Please. - I won't hurt you. - Stop pretending to be nice. Look at these really cool pictures I have of you. I just can't wait to post them so all your buds can see them. Hashtag Upstate Hunters. Hashtag Prey. Hashtag Pedophile Freak. - Hey. - What's up? - Nothing. - Really? This guy is missing. Isn't this the guy? Don't you find it kinda weird? He's gone missing now the whole town's looking for him. I don't know. That's not great. Is there something you were gonna tell me? No. nothing. I'll see you around, okay? - That's it? - Yeah. Yeah, it was nothing. I wanna let you go. Okay. First, I'm gonna tell you a story, okay? It's about a girl I used to know. Amelia. She was very pretty. And smart, creative, you know, all that stuff. But, she also liked attention. Needed it. She would write little songs. She wanted to be a singer. Like a star. So, she went on this website and she performed her songs and tried to get fans, you know? Was she good? She was okay, I guess. We didn't really pay attention. And, like, one of her fans, just started telling her to do stuff, like little dances and stuff like that. She got lots of likes and followers and stars. One day she was so excited. She was number one girl on the whole website for, like, a couple of hours. And, like, that's a really big deal. So, this guy... told her to flash him. Like, lift her shirt up. And, um... She barely had any tits. And then one day when, you know, she finally stood up to him, he... kind of like sent the picture of her flashing to, like, everyone in the school. I mean, like, 300 kids saw her tits by the time it spread around. She was so embarrassed. The boys, they would try to grope her. So, then she just decided to be what they said she was. She just used what she had. One girl beat her up. Even a teacher caught on that everyone thought she was a slut, so... He made some fucked up reference to it. And I didn't do anything to help her. At all. My mom took her off life support that Sunday... after she hanged herself in her closet. Last week... it was a year ago last week. On her birthday. I'm so sorry. That's why you have to confess. This should be over with, you know. - Who? - It should be just put to bed. What? You... You think I did this? Duh! - I saw you. - Saw me... - Heard you. - Do what? - You know what. - I don't. I've never seen... I don't know who your sister is. I saw you with the kids, and the dreamcatcher, the double dog, - loud music... - No. I promise. - He... - You have to listen to me. I don't believe you. I can't believe you. Oh, my God. Just tell me you did it. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for what I did. Hi Rory, it's me. Um... Listen, I really need your help. I would like it if you would come over tonight. - You okay? You look pale. - I'm diabetic. - I need my medication. - Why didn't you tell me? Seriously? So, what happens if you don't take it? The medication, like, is it, something you need to take every day? I can miss a couple of days if I need to, but... This is how I get if I don't take it at all. I'm fucked. Dehydration, kidney failure, coma. - Hey, careful. - I... Somebody's been drinking. - Come on. - Stop it. Stop. Get off me. Stop! Get off of me! Rory. Rory. Get off of me! Get off of me! Calm down. Okay, just calm down. Okay. Like, what are you even talking about. All right, you just went crazy. - You all right. - Yeah. I wouldn't have done anything. Rory. Fuck off. You're too psycho, know that? I just thought you'd be... that you'd just be like, uh... just like your sister. You're not worth this. All this shit. You have to help me get rid of him. What the fuck, Rosie? No way. No way. You need to call the cops. You know what I've been through. What my whole family's been through. - I'm not ruining my life, too. - Just come on. Just, do your injection. I was the one that found her. Just... Maybe you didn't do it. Maybe you did. In a way, it kind of feels like we all did. What would you do? Like, if this was you sister? Or, like, your daughter? I know. I understand. - I completely understand. - I'm glad. It's okay, you know. In the end she was really well known. Popular, I guess. In the end. So, she won. I just came to be here with you. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey. Come here. Come here. You're gonna be okay. Come here. Come here. Okay. Hey. Hey. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Hey. Hey. Hey. Come back. Hey. Come on. Wake up. Hey. Fuck. Fuck!
