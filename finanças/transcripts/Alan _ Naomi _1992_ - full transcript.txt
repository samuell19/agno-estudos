[chatter] Hit the glove, baby. [chatter] Hey, hey, cab! [honking] [engine humming] [dog barks] [indistinct chatter] Nothin' that can save you now, Silverman. [coughs up and spits] [boy 1] Whoa! Look at that thing go! [glass crashing] Yahoo! Beautiful foul. It went right into the window. -What a genius. -I'm tired of playin' ball. -Game's over. -Like hell! We didn't get -our last fix. -That's it, guys! -Game's over. We won. -Oh, so what? Big deal. We won the last three games in a row. Shut up, milquetoast. We won by five runs. One, two, three, four, five. Eat that with your pickled herring. Hey, cut that out. He can count to five. You know, I saw a circus once. Ones that could count to six. Shut your freakin' mouth, Kelly. [scoffs] You and Silverman, what a pair! Jew lover! [scoffs] Kelly's a Jew lover! [grunts] Let go of me. Cut it out, Silverman. He could pulverize you. Nighty-night, Condello. Don't wet your bed. Up yours! [dog barks] Damn it, Shaun. Why did you stop me? 'Cause you're an idiot! [jazz music continues] -Shaun? -Yeah? -Thanks. -You're welcome. No charge. Hey, Shaun, I'll race you to the second floor. -Come on, skinny. -You're a loser, Kelly. -Screwball! -Jerk! -[running] -[Alan] Ouch! [dog barking] [footsteps on stairs] -Screwball. -Jerk. What? What? -G'night, Jew! -G'night, Catholic Hey, you kids! What's the matter with you? It's not your floor! Get outta here! [whispers] Jesus Christ... What? [sighs] Al Silverman breaks Ruth's record. -[feet stomping] -The Yankee fans go wild. [paper ripping] [baby crying] [paper ripping continues] [baby crying] [thud] -It's okay. I live here. -[screams] Mama! Mama! Ils sont en bas! Mama! Mama! [baby cries] -Are you sure you won't stay? -Oh, dear, it looks delicious. -I am honored, but I cannot... -[door creaks] -Please. -Oh, oh... Hi, Mrs. Liebman. Alan, you're late for dinner again. Your father is home already. You with your baseball game. Mom, stick ball. Stick ball, stick ball. Even sounds like a game for hoodlums. -Go change for dinner. -I'm leaving you, Ruthie. -Oh, I wish you'd stay. -I'm leaving you, too. -Why don't you stay? -You have a family. -You have a supper. -Take something with you. -I'll give you such a punch. -Oh, don't you dare. Goodbye, sweetie. Thank you for... Call you later. All right. Alan, say goodbye to Mrs. Liebman. -She's leaving. -Goodbye to Mrs. Liebman. -She's leaving. -[Ruth sighs] Goodbye, Alan. -[door closes] -Wish you g'night. [dog barks] [engine cranking] [dog howls] Wanna say that again, Condello? [dog howls] -What is this? -Mom! Charles Atlas, huh? Alan, what do you want with muscles? A muscle is just a... muscle, huh? Character should be strong. Look at President Roosevelt, for goodness sake. He's a giant among men, yet he's in a wheelchair, shriveled from the waist down. Oh, thanks, Mom. Now, I feel a whole lot better. Come into dinner. Oh, and your father's upset about the war, so... [radio announcer] What began on D-Day as a mighty thrust into the soft underbelly of Nazi-occupied Europe has slowed to a crawl in the fields and hedge rows of France. Only George Patton and his third army continue to move at top speed towards the German border. [Sol] Things are bad, Alan. Eisenhower isn't thinking. -He advanced too fast. -[Alan] Sorry, I'm late, Pa. -Hey, Ma, what's for dinner? -Soup, chicken and whatever else I give you. I'd eat bread and water if only we could win this war already. [draws curtains] Tomorrow night, [lips smacking] bread and water. Dinner's on the table. Let's eat. [music playing] [music continues] [radio plays] ♪ With a flavor that's just right♪ ♪ It's delicious and nutritious♪ ♪ Bite-size and ready to eat♪ ♪ Take a tip from Tom Go and tell your mom♪ ♪ Shredded Ralston'’s can't be beat♪ Atomic Ralston'’s space shooters bring you another episode... in the mystery of... [Ruth] Alan, turn off the radio. -Why? -I have something to say. I don't want to be interrupted until I'm finished. What is it, Ruth? Problems with the super again? No, no, it's nothing like that. Look, Sol, you got your coffee. Alan, there's your milk. We have marble cake, day old, but it's good. [sirens wailing] I am going to talk and you are going to listen. Dessert in the living room? To listen? Yes, but you have to let me finish to the end! You haven't said anything. If you begin, then maybe we can let you finish. [Ruth] Oh, all right. Now you both know Mrs. Kirschenbaum, and her daughter, Naomi. Living across the way -with Mrs. Liebman? -[Alan] The crazy girl? Who are you, Dr. Freud? She's not crazy! They went through plenty. That child, Naomi... her father was killed by the Nazis right in front of her eyes. And then, for two years-- All right, Ruth, we know what kinda ugly things the Nazis do. Her and her mother, hiding out until Mrs. Liebman -could bring them over here. -[Alan] All the guys say -she's crazy. -She is not crazy and don't you ever let me hear you call her that again! [dog barking] She just... you know, she needs help. A lot of help. I think it was a mistake to bring her here to a mixed neighborhood. I mean, I'm sorry, Sol, this is not a very good neighborhood. Who said it was? I wish we could afford better. Sol, I am not blaming you! What is it? You of all... Well, forgive me for just working in the Department of Records. I'm sorry I'm not Mayor LaGuardia. -Alan, where are you going? -I gotta do my homework. Sit. Hear me out. [radio announcement continues] Now, before this girl can go to school again, the doctor says she has to learn to trust again. This girl need friends. Nice children. -Children her own age. -No! -[Ruth] Alan, have I asked you? -Yes! And she's a crazy girl -and I won't! -Alan, don't take that tone with your mother. [Ruth] Alan, it's nothing. It's simple. You just go over once a day after school. An hour, half hour. You go over and you just sit. I won't! I can't! I'd miss stick ball. Again with the... stick ball! [Alan] Mom, do you know how many of the guys call me sissy? If they found out I was hanging out with some crazy girl... I mean... [inhales sharply] I've got one friend on this whole block and, and he'd quit on me if he found out. [Sol] Alan, let's talk about this. I won't! And that's final! -[Ruth] Alan? -[door slams] [dog barks] [knock, knock] [door opens] [footsteps approaching] [door closes] -[Sol] Alan. -It's not fair. You can't make me do this. Alan, we can't make you do this, you're right. It isn't fair. [dog barking] And, besides, this thing is very delicate, like a surgical operation. Who would use a surgeon who hates what he's doing, hm? He could cut off your nose, your ears, even your whole head! Brrr! Zoop! Like that. But... Allow me one but? [bed creaks] In our life... [loud exhale] Alan, sometimes when we're young, sometimes when we're old, in our life... once or twice, we're called upon to do something that we can't do and we don't wanna do... And we won't do. But, we do it. Well, I won't. [exhales sharply] Alan, you've asked me more than once, "How can God allow the Nazis?" It's like asking, "Why do people die?" You say you don't believe in God. Well, sometimes God... finds you... when you least expect it. I won't ask you to do anything you can't do. Just... think about it, that's all I ask. Why does it have to be me? Maybe because you're one of the lucky ones. [knock, knock] [Ruth] Enough philosophy. I have to tell Mrs. Liebman something. [Sol] Tell her... we'll have an answer for her tomorrow. [bed creaks] [footsteps approaching] I hope you know what you're doing. If I knew what I was doing, I'd be President Roosevelt. Then again, Roosevelt has a very smart wife. She says, "“President, darling, maybe, you should do this. President, darling, maybe you should do that." She doesn't put a gun to his head. Fine, you become president, I'll put my gun away. In the meantime, I still don't have an answer. [piano music plays] [music continues] [crickets chirping] [Shaun] Hey, Al! What we gotta do is bring the outfielder further in, see? That way we can catch Condello's old blooper shots. I call it The Kelly Shift. Hey, Silverman, are you listening? -Hmm? -What do ya think of the plan, -for crying out loud? -[Alan] The plan? The Kelly Shift. Listen, Shaun, I forgot to tell you... -I can't play in the game today. -What? -Why not? -Well, I, I got an errand to do. Who's gonna catch all my pop shots? You could get Tony. It's only for today. What's the big deal, errand? Can't you do it after the game? Get outta here! No, I gotta do it by four. Then I got homework after. [scoffs] Terrific! You wanna be first in class. That's one of the worst things about you. You know I care if I'm first. Wait! One of the worst? What else? Huh? Come on, what else is bad about me? Well, some of the guys think you're yellow. I don't, but they do. Who cares? What're you gonna do, beat 'em up? Tit for tat... what's wrong with me? You? Nothing. You're a saint. Saint Shaun. [Shaun] Cut the bullshit, I mean the truth! I really wanna know. It won't hurt me. [school bell rings] -I swear. -Hey, what's wrong with me? Nothing. Come on! Well... maybe you're a little prejudiced. -Me? -Yeah, like against girls and stuff. Like all those dirty jokes you tell about them. That's something wrong with me? Wow, wow! Sweetie-sweet, you got a girlfriend or something? Are you kidding? Better not. [Shaun] I ain't hangin' around with no sissies, that's for sure! [cello playing] [cello playing continues] Oh, hello. [chuckles] [speaking Jewish] You are such a good boy. You're a kind boy. I can't say enough... [sobs] from my heart. Thank you. An apple? A pear? A banana? -Huh? -No, really, Mrs. Liebman. Maybe I'll be hungry another time. [mutters in Jewish] Alan, this is Mrs. Kirschenbaum, Naomi's mother. This is the boy. Merci. Merci bien,Alan. Merci,Alan. [speaks French] Firstly, Alan, [chuckles] I want you should understand That... in Switzerland, after they got away from the Nazis, Naomi was very sick... but she got better. Much better. She studied at home, by herself. She's very, very smart girl. Now, however... [breathes heavily] she's somewhere else most of the time. And we want that she should wake up from it. Thank God, God, God. [Mrs. Liebman] You understand? Now, come. Hm? Here. Come with me. [music resumes] [Mrs. Liebman] It's important, dear, that, uh, you shouldn't move too quickly. You shouldn't get too close. You shouldn't make loud noises, because it frightens her. Yeah? You understand? [paper ripping] [metal clanks] [paper ripping continues] [music keeps playing] [paper ripping continues] I don't blame you for not looking at me. I think I scared you pretty bad in the hallway yesterday. Most people don't think I look that scary. In fact, I wish I did. But, I mean, not, not in the stairwell, when girls are on the floor and all. [paper rips] [Alan] I hear your name's Naomi. Mine's Alan... Alan Drucker Silverman. Actually, I've never told anyone my middle name before. I always thought they might laugh... [birds chirping] But, you don't laugh. It's my mother's maiden name. It's German. I mean, I mean, the good Germans... Not the Gestapo Germans. The Jewish Germans. It means "printer" in German. You know, like someone who prints paper. Not unlike the paper you're tearing right there. [paper rips] Which, I mean... it's fine that you're tearin' paper. It, it looks very... relaxing. [ripping continues] [stick ball bat tapping] [boys playing outside] [chair scraping] [chair creaks] [boys play and dog barks] Good grief. [Alan] Well, if you don't even speak any English... Your mother doesn't. If you don't understand English, we're really in trouble. I don't speak a single word of French. Well, maybe one... Bonjour? Uh, Eiffel tower? Uh... Can-can in Gay Paree? [taps feet] Ooh-la-la? Poodle? [distant chatter continues] [sigh] [boys cheering] [paper ripping] [birds chirping] [paper ripping] [paper ripping continues] [rips aggressively] [screaming] Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! [Naomi pants] Naomi, Naomi... [speaking in French] [continues panting] [door opens] [slams shut] [rushing footsteps] [door opens and slams shut] [thump, thump] [Alan] Don't even think about making me go back there. I have never been so embarrassed in my full, whole, entire lifetime. I'm not going back! You wouldn't believe how awful it was! I'm not going back! -Alan... -What happened? -What went on over there? -I'm not going back! That's final! Totally, fully, completely final. [clock ticking] [children playing outside] [orchestra music] [children laughing] [music and gunshots] [cartoon character hollers] [explosion] [children laugh] [commotion] [character hollers] [orchestra music plays] [cheering and applause] [indistinct whispers] [drum roll and trumpet call] Cut it out, Shaun Kelly, or I'll call the usher. [giggles] [narrator] ...on the march... I was just seeing if you had a head attached to all that hair. [mutters unintelligibly] If you don't like it, then go sit somewhere else. It's a free country. We can sit anywhere we want! Right. Then why don't you sit in my lap? [giggles] -[thud] -[screams] [narrator] ...bring back the tide of the allied invasion force on the western front. [booing, narration continues] In the general's own words, "it's been a long, hard road, -but this is the payoff." -[drum roll] Now the hopes of these German families for Deutschland'’s thousand-year Reich, lie in ruins. Starvation and suffering have replaced the glorious dream -of Adolph Hitler. -[drum roll] [boy] Come on, let's play some ball. Come on! [Alan] I was supposed to play stick ball with 'em. [cheering] But they got a guy who's a better player than I am... to take my place. [paper ripping] It's just for the day, though. [more cheering] [exhales] I sure hope he strikes that. [paper ripping] I wasn't gonna come here today. I didn't wanna come. But, um... last night I had this dream about you. [birds chirping] [paper ripping] And even though... I don't know what kind of... horrible things happened to you in real life... in the dream... it was so sad. [thump] [paper ripping] [exhales and chair creaks] And, um, when I woke up this morning, I thought that... if anything that terrible would've happened to me... I sure would hope someone would give me another chance.

If, if Alan... ever bothers you, well, just come to me, 'cause I'm the roughest, toughest hombrein New York. And... I'm here to protect you... and your little doll.

Yes, sir... [jazz music plays] So what's it gonna be? You gonna play in the game today, -or what? -We have a test. A test? That's on Monday. We could play a whole world series by Monday. Don't tell me you're thinkin' about missin' another game? That'd be the fourth one this week. [distant train horn] I can't help it, Shaun. -I, uh... -Right. I know, I know. You got an errand. Look, Al, what's gotten into you? I'm talkin' about stick ball, okay? Stick ball! Somethin's bothering you. What is it? You can't tell me? What's the deal then? Is it Condello? You know I'll take care of him for you. Oh, yeah, you did a great job of that yesterday. [laughs] I don't need you to fight my battles for me. What then? I can't tell you. Look, if you don't wanna be on the team, just say the word. I can get Tony Ferrara to take your place. -Are you kiddin'? -Huh? Of course, I wanna be on the team. Well, if you're gonna be on it... Be on it. [door opens] [approaching footsteps] [thud] Can't I take a day off? I mean, I think I deserve one, once in a million years. So, you may, but you could at least let us know about it first, yes? Across the way, they were waiting for you as usual. If I'd told you, you wouldn't let me go. And you would've started in on, on how lucky I am that I wasn't born in Berlin, Germany, -right next to Heinrich Himmler! -[slams pot] I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say. -I didn't mean it. -[pot slams] [pot slams] We have to hear him, Ruth. We've put too much pressure. [pots clanking] [door slams] All right. So, you took the afternoon off and you didn't tell us. Terrible! Ten years in the clink on water and stale bread. Are you turning this into a joke, Sol? We can't tell him that if he takes a day off someone may lose a battle. He's not a soldier, right, Alan? He's just Alan, plain and simple. Taking a day off is his constitutional right. -Fine. -[plates clattering] [thud] And what, may I ask, was our upstanding American citizen -doing? -I was playing stick ball, okay? It's a Miracle I haven't already been thrown off the team! I've missed every game this week! [Ruth] He's your son, say something. He may be his father's son, but he's got his mother's temper! -Look how you two battle! -[dog barks] General Eisenhower himself would think twice before locking horns with you two Silvermans. -[thud] -[bird chirping] Alan... [refrigerator door opens and closes] Listen to your father. You're much more than a stick ball player. If you were only a stick ball player, I wouldn't even bother. But you're a person, a mensch. I hate being a mensch. I don't wanna be a mensch. Do you know what it's like with a crazy girl? You can't even get mad at her. You're not allowed because she's crazy! And you feel crazy, too, because you do crazy things to keep her from being crazy! And it doesn't work! Nothing works! Alan... You are my son, and I am your father. And as your father, I forgive you ten times over for playing stick ball. So... I hope that, as my son, you'll forgive me... five times over for telling you now that I expect you to eat the cold chicken your mother left for you in the refrigerator, brush your teeth... then go to Naomi. [slow music plays] [crickets chirping] [music continues] [paper ripping] Alan... I understand. [baby crying] Please... [airplane flying overhead] ["Frere Jacques" plays on piano] Jacques? [thud] Why you so sad? Pourquoi? Please, Jacques, do not be crying. Do not cry because of me. [Alan] I'm not crying. Just lost my head for a minute. [Naomi] You are so silly, Monsieur Jacques. [Alan] I like the way you say my name, Miss. It makes me seem a lot nicer than I really am. Oh, no, no. You are a very nice person. [Naomi] Very, very nice. I'm, I'm really happy to know that you speak English. Yeah, I have to take English for a time. But she is still not very excellent. Oh, no, she, she is. She's, she's good. [chuckles] The only place they wouldn't understand you is Texas But you can learn that easy. All you have to know is "howdy do". How-dee-doo. Now, all you need is a ten-gallon hat, Naomi. Naomi? There is no Naomi. Who is that? There is... only me. I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to say Naomi. -I meant... -Non! Non, n'approche pas! N'approche pas! [Alan] May I ask what your name is? ["Frere Jacques" plays on piano] I am... Yvette. [sighs] That's a beautiful name. So pretty. You will come tomorrow, Jacques? Oui? [Alan] Yeah, sure. A bunch of buffalo couldn't stop me from comin'. Booffalow? What is booffalow? [music continues] And these booffalow... they are here? In the city? Not since I came to town. [Ruth] Sophie Liebman, I don't know how she does it. She's having a hard enough time making ends-- what? She's gonna be fine. I'm bleeding to death here! Oh, stop it. What a baby. It's nothing. You do my hair, we have to call an ambulance. -Would you keep your head still? -[Alan] Mom, Dad! [door closes] You won't believe it! She talked to me! It was just to my dummy, but she talked! [laughter] -All right, all right! -Put me down or I'll snip -those ears off! -[laughter] -Good boy! Oh, congratulations. -Oh, I told you! I told you! -I told you if you just waited. -And I told him. I told him! I knew he could do it. What did you say? How did you do it? -What did she say? -I forgot. What do you mean, you forgot? You did it with the doll? [laughter] What did the doll say? -[shutters roll] -Soleil! [distant bells chime] Did you know that they used to call me Juggling Jack? Wanna find out why? Uh, yeah. Why not? Oh... [bird sings] Jacques... Catch. [thud] [band music plays] [music continues] [crash] [band music still playing] [mimics airplane flying] [whoosh] [buzzing] [Alan] Hey, what do you say we get... [breathless] we get together a game of stick ball? -[Shaun] You? Stick ball? -[Alan] Hey, I can play today. Just not on the weekdays anymore. What? Why not? -What's goin' on? -[Alan] It's that errand. It's kind of a permanent errand on weekdays. But on Saturdays I can do whatever I want. Anyway, it's a family secret. Is your father a drunk or something? My father? I don't think he's ever drunk anything in his life. Except for maybe on Passover. -What's Passover? -Oh, it's a holiday that takes place around Easter. It's for the ancient Hebrews who escaped from Egypt. I go to my grandparents' house. [Shaun] My grandfather's in Ireland. I've never seen him. Well, maybe sometime you could come with me and visit mine. You'd like him. He tells great stories. Yeah, maybe. Maybe I will. -So what's this big secret? -What? Your mystery errand? I can't tell you. I would if I could, Shaun. [birds cawing] What's wrong? [music plays] [jazz music plays] [loud footsteps] -[Shaun] Hey, look! -[Alan] What? [Shaun] There she is... Crazy Cat. [dog barking] [Alan] Hey, uh, Shaun, what do you say we go fly -some more planes? -Jacques? Are you there? Hello... Jacques? That's weird. She always runs away from me. Have you been fighting today, zebooffalow? [whispers] She's crazy. Jacques,you will visit me today? Oui? You will visit Yvette? Oh, yeah. Sure. Anytime. [Mrs. Liebman] Naomi! Come inside! Hey! Please! S'il vous plaît. M-my friend. [baby crying] [door slams] -[curtains drawn roughly] -[radio playing music] [slams door] [locks door] [knock, knock] -[Sol] Alan? -Leave me alone. -[Sol] Alan, what is so wrong? -Nothing. Leave me alone. [Sol] That's some nothing. [Sol] But since you say it's nothing, I'm relieved. Because there is something that I have to talk to you about. [stomp] [Alan] What? Your mother's afraid to ask you to do a certain something. She's afraid of your explosions. I don't explode! Yeah, I'm glad you've inherited your mother's temper. It's good. It's healthy. Like an apple a day, it keeps the doctor away. And once in a while, everyone else as well. [chuckles] So what was the certain something you wanted -to talk to me about? -Ah, yes, the something. Alan, [clears throat] there's this doctor, and the doctor sees Naomi once a week. They discuss how she's coming along, what should be done next... That sort of thing, you know? [Alan] No. I mean, I, I didn't know. Well, um, anyway, they've discussed this business of your puppet talking to her doll. It's a dummy, not a puppet. Forgive me, I'm a dummy when it comes to dummies. Anyway, they've all agreed, and the doctor said herself that you did a terrific job! Naomi trusts you now. That's, uh, that's terrific. The word "terrific," Mrs. Liebman told your mother, is exactly the word the doctor used. What comes after terrific, however, is this... [bird chirps] Naomi must not get too dependent on that doll. She can't use that doll as a crutch. You understand? [Alan] I thought it was supposed to be so terrific. Absolutely... As a first step. But now she's got to take another step, and you have to help. You have to begin to talk to her. The person... Naomi Kirshenbaum. -Direct. -I can't, Dad. She, she won't talk without her doll. I've tried it. -[Sol] You have to try again. -Oh, sure, so I have to do everything! They should pay me instead of that doctor. [Sol] Alan, that's not you talking! I'm doing all the work! That doctor's doing plenty of work, believe me. And in case you want to know, it's for free. And if the doctor says you stop with the dummy, then you stop with the dummy, -already! -She's scared to death without her doll! You should see her, Dad! I can't do it! Let the doctor do it! Let the doctor risk losing friends! Let the doctor miss stick ball! What is this? The fourth of July? Such a tummel! I wish I had never met Naomi. -Alan! -I wish I had never met her! [door slams] [pipe music playing] [paper ripping] [bird chirping] [distant siren] Yvette... I can't see you, But, I can feel you with my cowboy heart. [ripping continues] Please come out, Yvette. Once again, I have to apologize for my clumsy friend, Alan. When he told me that... [sighs] That he pretended not to know you on the staircase yesterday, and... that, that he let his friend... make fun of you right in front of your own eyes... [bird chirps] I almost rode off into the sunset in shame. [chirping continues] Naomi, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. [bird chirps] [bed creaks] Naomi is disappeared. [whimpers] She is disappeared. There is no Naomi. There is only me. [Naomi] Yvette. Naomi... please, talk to me, Naomi. [voice breaks] There is no Naomi. [sniffs] [Alan whispers] Naomi, please. No! [sobbing] Mama! Mama! Mama! [softly] Please, let me. [speaking French] [Naomi] Mama. [sobs quietly] Yvette? Ouù estYvette? Ouù est-tu? [sniffs] She's right here, Naomi. Don't worry, she's okay. Jack's taking good care of her. Naomi... [weeps softly] I'm sorry I hurt you. I'll never do it again. I promise, Naomi. [sniffs] I wanna help you, not hurt you. You're my friend, Naomi. My very special friend. Now, please, Naomi... Let me help you. [Alan] Can you hear me, Naomi? Naomi? Naomi. Oui...Alan. [sniffs] [violins play] [Naomi whispers] Oui...Alan. [sizzling] [birds chirping] [Ruth] Sol, are you cooking those eggs or hatching them? Masterpieces can't be rushed, Ruth. Just watch, Alan. When he's finally finished, he'll tell us his omelet is too gorgeous to eat! Then we'll all have to ooh and ah until we're finally allowed to take -our first bite. -Ma, do you ever think we could -adopt Naomi? -What a question! She already has a mother. What does she need with two mothers? Well, she doesn't have a father, and she could use a super-duper mother and father like you two. Sol, are you hearing this? All of a sudden we're super-duper. So, what else is new? That boy... sometimes he is such a pain in the tuchis. -Sometimes... [laughs] -[lips smacking] What's the surprise, huh? He's his father's son. -[door buzzer] -Oh. They're here already. How do I look? How do you look? You look like a boy. Pop, umm, don't talk about the war. And Mom, remember, anything you do, don't get too close to her. And don't make any hysterical, loud noises. And don't make any fast, sudden, harsh movements. Well, so much for my super-duper. -Hello, sweetie. -Hello, Mrs. Liebman. -[chuckles with glee] -Hello. Mmmm... Is this Sol's cooking? -Hi, Naomi. -Hi. -Hello, Ruthie. -Welcome, Naomi. I'm Alan's mother. Oh... [speaks French] Breakfast will be ready in just a moment. All right? Alan, would you show Naomi around the house? [speaks French] [blows kisses] [bird chirps] It's a good house. I mean, it's not great, but it's okay. My mom's always cleaning everything, so it looks better than it really is. Nice house. You wanna see my room, hmm? -I would like. -Come on, I'll show you all my stuff. [bird chirping] [click] [big band music] [thump, metal clanks] I'm very sorry. [Alan] It's okay, don't worry about it. Now, I see what you see. [music continues] -[Naomi] May I? -[Alan] Sure. I built it. Yeah, it flies. Oh, sure. Yeah. It's nice. I'll take you flying sometime. Oh, really? Ooh. It's very nice. Oh, what's this? It's a trumpet. Trumpet. [blowing air] It doesn't work. [trumpet note] [chuckles] [blowing air] It doesn't work. You like it? It's nice. It's yours. You can have it. Oh, no. No, no. It's too nice. I cannot. No, I want you to have it. [music continues] Thank you very much. [knock, knock] [Sol] Alan? Aren't you going to introduce us? Uh, this is my father. And this is my very quiet mother whom you've met already. -Naomi, welcome to our home. -[whispers] It's a pleasure to have you. Naomi, if you're hungry, please come... yes, come... Come for some omelets. Today's turned out so lovely, it's almost too gorgeous to eat. [whistles] Let's go fly planes. Okay, but I've got to be back at school by five... to help Mrs. Landley with something. What something? Oh, nothing much. Just an errand. That's you, Secret Silverman. Everything's always gotta be a big secret to you. If I had a secret like that, I would tell you. That's what best friends are for. You know, go on to Mrs. Landley. I don't feel like flying planes, anyway. Shaun! [crickets chirping] [air raid sirens] -[screams] No! Mama! -Naomi, -it's only an air raid drill! -[screaming] [dog barking] [sirens continue] [Alan] If I don't turn out the light, -we could all get arrested. -[speaking French] [Alan] Naomi, listen to the radio. Hello, America. Yes, it's true. All the light bulbs in New York City have been eaten up. The notorious light bulb monster strikes again. Mr. Monster, will you please tell us a few words to our terrified audience? [monster voice] Yes, I love those light bulbs. Crunchy, crispy, hundred watt glass potatoes with ketchup. [snarls, munches] [Mrs. Liebman] Naomi, hey. You don't have to be afraid. [monster voice] And now, for some headlights, with salt and pepper! And I love your street lights! Oh, they're like lollipops. Cherry lollipops! Lemon lollipops! And lime lollipops! [laughing] Wunderbar! [sirens] [monster voice] Oh, I think I'm going to throw up! Uh-oh! Here comes all the lights! [screams] [laughing, clapping] [gags] [giggles] Alan, you are a screwball. Listen. Don't forget, I want you to call just as soon -as you get there. -There's no telephone there. It's just a big field. Thank you, Charles Lindbergh. Then go and find a pharmacy, maybe, or a candy store. Okay, okay. All right. Say goodbye to Mrs. Liebman. [speaking French] And don't you dare let her out of your sight for one minute. Trust me. Make sure you're back by 4:30 on the dot. Have a wonderful time, huh? [band music playing] [engine humming] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [doors open with a bang] [Alan] Well, this is it. It's not really an airport anymore. But it's still my favorite place. [pigeons cooing] But... where are the planes? Uh, well, they're all gone. But this used to be the biggest airport -in New York. -[wings fluttering] [Alan] ...two, three, four, -five, six... -My finger is so tired. You're doing great. ...seven, eight, nine... 700. [speaking French] Alan, look, Alan, I am faster. Alan! [laughing] You should give it a name. Like what? Sorry. Umm, Oiseau Jaune. Okay, what does that mean? Hmm... yellow bird. -Yellow? -Yes, call it -The Yellow Bird. -All right, but Shaun... Well, I don't care. I just won't tell him. Shaun? Your friend on the stairs? Here comes Crazy Cat. [birds cawing] Oh, Alan, I don't care. I don't care. You know, he... he says things, but he doesn't mean 'em. He really is a great guy. I am crazy, you know. No, you're not. There's nothing wrong with ya. No... I killed my father, you know? [thud] I thought he was killed by the Nazis. [Naomi] No, I helped them, you see? I killed him with the maps! You see? The maps! He said we had to tear up all the maps. For the soldiers... [sobs] the resistance soldiers... My father made all the maps. Maps of the sewers. [Alan] Naomi, it's okay. [crashing noises] [stomp, crash] My father! My father! [Alan] Naomi, it wasn't your fault, it was the Nazi's. Look... My hands are clean. My dress is clean. And he's dead. That's all. [speaking French] Don't be afraid anymore, Naomi. No one's going to hurt you. Don't be afraid, all right? Okay? Okay. [thud] -[door creaks] -Shaun, I need to talk to you. Talk? I ought to beat your brains out. For crying out loud, Shaun, just listen for a minute. Let me explain. Okay, Silverman, you've got one minute. My parents made me do it, Shaun. There's something wrong with her. Are you kidding? You pretended not to know her. You said your errand wasn't important. Why didn't you trust me? I don't know. I guess I was afraid. I was afraid you wouldn't like me anymore Because... every guy who hangs out with a girl, you call 'em a sissy. And this isn't just any girl. This is a girl we made fun of. This is crazy cat. Shaun, don't you understand? What's with you, Silverman? She seemed crazy, that's all. And don't you know when I'm kidding? Besides, you could've told me what was wrong with her, but, no, you had to lie. You're right. I was wrong. And I'm really sorry, Shaun. Well, I'm not. I'm glad I found out about you. Look, from now on, I'm gonna stay outta your way, okay? But just stay the hell outta mine. And don't worry. I never called her Crazy Cat to no one else. I just said that to you because I thought... I thought I could say anything to you because we were like... like brothers almost. Well, I was wrong. So just stay outta my way and I'll stay outta yours. Okay? Deal. [indistinct chatter] [knock, knock] Hey, Mr. Glum face. Wonderful news. The doctor says Naomi can start school on Monday. -You're kidding. -No. [laughing] She's so happy. Such good news. Is she in all my classes? Sure! Sure! The principal we went to see twice. Everything is prepared, ya. You should be proud. Yes, it's because of you, your help. Yes. [sighs] God sees everything. Your name will be inscribed in the book of life. I believe. I believe. I believe. [commotion] Good morning, Mrs. Landley. This is Naomi Kirshenbaum. [bell rings] [Mrs. Landley] People. People! We have a new member in our class today. She's a wonderful girl from Paris, France. Her name is Naomi. I may mispronounce this... Naomi Kirshenbaum, right? Now, class, let's give Naomi a big welcome In her native tongue. Bienvenue,Naomi. [class] Bienvenue,Naomi. Again, class. [class] Bienvenue,Naomi. [Mrs. Landley] Now, class, where were we yesterday? Let me think. Voila. I am finished. Now, I read yours first, okay? Thank you. Alan, you're writing looks like a dizzy spider crawled through some ink and jumped on your page. I have an "unshal"... Unusual. -"Ununshual"... -Unusual. ...unusual neighbor. Alan, you write about me for the assignment? Her name is Naomi Cherrytree. You are very crazy. She is short and fat... has purple hair. -Curly, pur... -Purple hair. Purple hair, curly polka-dot ears. And she never needs to worry about a costume for Halloween. You are a cabbage. A silly American cabbage. -Oh, no. -Read, Cabbage. I first meet Alan Silverman in the hallway. I was so afraid of him very much because he carries a stick. I am afraid of sticks. I am afraid much times. But I am now his friend and I am now not afraid anymore. In France is a word... ami du core. De couer. Ami de couer. -Ami de couer. -Couer. A good friend. A friend from the heart. This is beautiful, Naomi. Read, Cabbage. If I had a brother, I would like he should be like Alan. Because a brother should be kind and funny. Alan is very good at many things. Oh, but this is nothing. What is best... Alan makes me laugh when I am crying inside myself. Alan is very like my father. And he brings my hope back to me. That is the end of my essay. You're terrible, Cabbage. I write nice... What I feel. Well, this is just my silly version. I'll write a good one tonight. Poodle brain. Poodle? You said poodle? That's funny. This was a word you said the first day you came into our house. It was? Oh, yeah. Umm... poodle... Eiffel tower... Can-can in Gay Paree. -I didn't know you heard me. -Of course. I have much excellent ears. But... my favorite is how you sing to me. You liked my singing? "Frère Jacques" was my favorite song. My father sings to me. He had a soft voice like you. A sweet voice. He would rock me and sing to me... [softly] ♪ Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques♪ And I was safe. [whispers] I was safe. -[boy] Hubba, hubba! -[Alan] Go jump in the lake. [Naomi] What means, hubba hubba? [Alan] Well, it means, you know... it means you're pretty. [boy] Hey! What do you know? Sweetheart, Jews! Hey, Yids, I hear you two are married. Is that right, Silverman? Kissy, kissy. I hear you heres you do all kinds of dirty things. No wonder Hitler wants to wipe you off the face of the earth. [shouting] [Alan] Run, Naomi! Run! [smack] [screams] [Shaun] Condello, watch the birdie! [smack] [Condello] Hey, stop it! I didn't mean nothin'! I didn't mean nothin'! [door slams] [bell rings] I guess I do need you to help me fight my battles. Well, we're a good team, Al. You can't go home like that. You're all covered with blood. Lose any teeth? No. Jeez, it's pourin' out of your nose. Listen, my mother's not home. We can go to my house and get you cleaned up there, -if you want. -What about school? Well, you've got a good excuse, And I really don't care. Slow up. I gotta carry all these books. All you have to do is bleed. Here's your hat. Hey, what's that behind your ear? I thought you said you didn't lose any teeth. I didn't. It's not mine. [chuckles] [dog barking] I'm sorry about the shirt, Mom. Another shirt, we can get. Another tooth, that other boy will never grow. [chuckling] If somebody called me a dirty Jew, I'd give them -a smack and I mean a smack! -Give him a smack! [lips smacking] Can I go see Naomi? I'm worried about her. Naomi, she's in school, no? Well, while we were fighting, I thought she came back here. Oy, gevalt. I was just in the apartment. -She's not there. -Go check again. I'll call the school. [siren] We've checked out every possible lead so far. We'll keep on searching until it gets dark, but then I'm afraid the best we can do is to stop and start again in the morning. [man] Officer, you couldn't send a few more men? -A child is missing! -[Alan] I have an idea. Remember that time I took Naomi to the Holmes airport? Yeah. Could be. -Tell the cop over there. -You think I should? -Of course, idiot! -Officer, I know Naomi, and I took her to the Holmes Airport once. She might be there. Well, let's go check it out. We'll getta holda Patt and you do whatever you have to do. [music plays] [dog barking] [speaks quietly] I hope you had better luck than we did. We looked at the whole airport. We saw nothing out there. [speaking indistinctly] All right. Nothing. Nothing. Alan, the best thing for you is to get some sleep. It's almost 11:00 and your friend, Shauny, should get some sleep, too. I'm not going anywhere until we find Naomi. Me, neither. It could be all night. It could be days. We have no idea where she is. I'm gonna go get a flashlight. [clank] [squeak] [music still playing] [groaning] [squeaky voice] Shaun, see what you can do. Mrs. Kirschenbaum... [Ruth] Alan, go ahead. Say something. Talk to her. Hey, Naomi. I'm okay now. It was just a little fight we had. There's nothing to be afraid of. Come on, Naomi. [crying] [Sol] Come here, Naomi. Come here, Naomi. Come here, sweetheart. It's gonna be all right. Alan... [birds chirping] Here, take these flowers. We're friends of Naomi and we'd like to say hello. Come on, say hi to Naomi. Listen for a minute, Alan. You're not God. You're Alan, and you've done all you can. But, this isn't the end. [Sol] Someday, you'll see I'm right. Someday this war will be over. Someday Hitler will be dead. But Naomi will be alive and well and happy. She needs more time. I don't understand. It's not fair. Why did this have to happen to her? What happens in this world isn't caused by you or by me. And it's not always fair. Wait for me.
