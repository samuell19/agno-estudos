We've got a love that's called radar love. Let me ask you something. How much does this guy owe? A couple a hundred. A couple hundred? That's what you brought me down here for? Hey, this cocksucker told Moran to go fuck himself. No one tells my cousin to go fuck himself. Guess not. He thinks he's a tough guy just because he's the son of John Sullivan. He thinks he can go and do and say whatever the fuck he wants. Thinks Whitey Smith and those old-timers time are gonna protect him again. Not tonight. I just want you to promise me one thing... that I'm the one who gets to put the bullet in this fucking guy's head. You mean to tell me this guy's old man, the John Sullivan? And they're all right with this? What they don't know, they ain't ever gonna know. I got it, kid. It's for me. Yeah? Yeah. OK. OK, I got it. Her, too? OK. It's all set. He's there now. All right. Let's go. I got to take a piss. Me, too. We've been here a couple hours now. Now you guys gotta piss? Bless me Father, for I have sinned. I've done a terrible thing. Gimme a hand here. Hey, Murph. Did you see the Johnny Carson show last night? Oh, no. I missed it. Who was on? Dolly Parton. Oh. Fuckin' A. You retard! He's got his own show. Morning, gents. Hey, Francis. Murph was late again. What's up, Murph? I see you've been to mass already, huh? Yeah, 6:30. You getting your ashes today? Yeah, yeah. I've got to take Grace and the kid to the 10 o'clock. Father Mahoney was looking for you this morning after mass. Said he had something to ask you. Said it was important. He say what it was about? No. Morning, lads. Whitey. Francis. Whitey. A word with you? Murph, give the lads the usual. Whitey, thanks. Sit down. What brings you in here so early this morning? We've got a problem, Francis. What kind of problem is that? You don't know? No, I paid Brian Murphy everything I owe him already. I don't give a shit about Brian Murphy. I got a phone call last night. Fascinating phone call, as a matter of fact. Do you know what it was about? I haven't a clue. Well, someone thinks your brother is back in the neighborhood. What brother could that be? What brother could that be? The only fucking brother you've got, wise ass. Well, that's what I'm saying. You and I both know that's impossible, seeing as Sean's dead. Some people think so, and other people don't think so. Well who's not thinking so all of a sudden? The same fucking people who wanted him dead in the first place. Do you know anything about this? No, I don't know anything. Don't fuck with me. Maggie Shea says she saw him over at Red Kelly's on the avenue last night. Now, you're going to go over there and check that out later, right? Yeah, yeah, I'll go over there and check it out after mass. Good. Then you'll come by and see me and let me know what you found out. Because, Francis, you see, I don't need this kind of trouble right now. And this neighborhood doesn't need this kind of trouble. Do you understand what I'm telling you? Now, don't fuck around with me on this one, all right? The best, lads. - All right. Cheers, Whitey. Whitey, take it easy, buddy. Everything all right? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. Morning, Fran. Who the hell is it? It's your nephew. Open up. Don't worry, it's me. I like what you did with the place. Still looks like shit. Don't start with the bullshit, pal. It's too early. What the hell are you doing here anyhow? You're not thinking of dragging me off to mass, are you? No, no, I got a question for you. How's your aunt, by the way? Did she ask about me? No, and she's fine. She never comes by to see me anymore. Hey look, she's probably just busy, that's all. Busy with what? Want some toast? No, no, I'm fine. I mean, what do you want me to say? She likes the suburbs. What's to like about Long Island? Look, I don't know. Maybe she likes you know the trees and having a backyard. Backyard my ass. It's disgraceful. Leaving the neighborhood to the spics and the niggers. One day there'll be no Irish left here. Then what'll she say then? You know what? Then she'll be dead. Sickens me, Fran. It sickens me. Yeah, well, you know what? I'll tell her you said so. But, look, I got something I gotta talk to you about. Whitey Smith came by my place this morning. Himself? I don't know why your father ever liked him. Thought it made him look more legit, I guess. Whitey Smith in his new suits and his phony smile, off the boat, donkey prick that he is. Where was he for your father when the feds come down after him? He's always been good to me, you know that. Helped me out of my toughest jam, right? That was guilt. Guilt for abandoning your father, letting him die in prison. What was he asking? He was asking about my brother, Sean. Asking what? He heard a rumor that Sean's back in the neighborhood. What, the shit-for-brains doesn't know he's dead? No, he knows. He knows? Well what... why was he asking, then? Well I was hoping maybe you might know. Well, what do I... what do I know? How a man rises from the dead? Did they ever find his body? They found an arm! Didn't they? An arm! Yeah, but not the rest of him. Sean was never found because by the time that those animals got through with him, there was nothing left to find. Maybe a hand here and an arm there, but that'd be about it. God rest his soul. Well, what do you think this is about? I mean, I've got to go back over to Whitey's and give him some kind of explanation. Go tell him Whitey that you asked around the neighborhood, and unless his ghost is haunting the streets, young Sean has not been seen in Hell's Kitchen since 1980. All right? OK. Hey, Red, how you doing, man? I'm still here, ain't I? Good night last night? How you doing? So what can I do you for? Here to talk about your brother? Yeah, yeah, I heard you had a guy in here last night who looked like him? - Looked a lot like him. But, I mean, you know, it wasn't him. I know what Sean looks like. I grew up with the kid. So, you have any idea who this guy was? I never saw him before. He was just some kid in a black pea coat. You know, he's off one of the ships, shore leave, you know. So you have no idea who he is then? I have no idea. All I know is it was not your brother. It's ridiculous. No, I know, it's a little weird, because I had Whitey coming by my place, asking questions. I don't know what the hell it's all about. Don't worry about it. It's nothing. I don't know what Maggie's talking about. What do you mean, Maggie? Maggie was tending bar. She's the one who talked to him. And she talked to him? Yeah. She swears it was him, but I wouldn't listen to her. Huh. That's interesting. All right. - All right. - Thanks a lot, man. - Sure, Francis. All right. Whitey, he's here! All right, come on. Francis, have you seen the ghost? No, Mrs. Diaz. What ghost is that? Your brother's ghost. I saw it last night. He was here. He came and he bought some cigarettes and then he left. The ghost did? Yes, the ghost. This ghost have a pea coat on, by any chance? Yes, like a sailor. It wasn't a ghost, Mrs. Diaz. It was just some guy that looked like Sean. All right? I saw him, too. It wasn't Sean. It wasn't any ghost, comprende? He was a ghost from the dead. Yes, I was not the only one who saw him. Maggie Shea was here, and she said that she, too, saw the ghost. - Maggie Shea. Yes. That figures. Put this on my account. What the fuck are you doing here? What are you talking about? Are you doing this to get back at me? Fran, I'm not doing anything, and I've got no need to get back at you. Why the fuck are you telling anyone who will listen that you saw Sean last night? Because I did see him. You realize what a fucking sick thing that is to say? You think I don't know what I saw? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you think this easy on me, or Grace, or anyone who cared about him? You go around telling people he's back from the fucking grave. It was him, and you know it. No. All I know is he's fucking dead. All right? Now why don't you let him stay there? Because it was him. I talked to him. Did I fucking hurt you that badly? I hurt you that fucking badly, you've got to make up a crazy story like this? You didn't fucking hurt me. You're going to get me fucking killed, all right? You think about that? Did you fucking think about that? Don't put that on me. I know what you and Father Mahoney did... What the fuck are you talking about, me and Father Mahoney? You know what I'm talking about. Do me a favor. When it comes to me and Sean and my business, keep your fucking mouth shut, all right? Hey, Fran? What if I tell people it wasn't true? Will that make a difference, do you think? Maybe then you could give us another chance. I could tell people I just made it up. You're a sick fucking bitch. Fuck you. And another thing... you didn't hurt me. I was the best thing you ever had. Hey, Mrs. Flanagan, how are you doing? Fine. Shopping for the Puerto Ricans again? Yeah, well, you know, they're family, right? So they are. But I hope you're not getting too close to that girl, though. Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about that, all right? Yeah, OK. You're late. You know, it's good to see you, too. It's already 11:20. The groceries you asked for? Don't mention it. You're welcome. Thank you. Where's little Sean? He's at Teresita's this morning. Let's go. I don't want to be late. Good morning, Mrs. Quinonez. How are you? Real friendly house you got here. You been out at all yet today? - No. I've been waiting for you. Look, I'm sorry. I had some things I had to take care of. But you haven't heard anything kind of weird or kind of funny? Like what? Well, apparently there was some guy last night in Red Kelly's who looked a lot like Sean. All right? And he was just some guy in the Navy having a drink. But now Maggie Shea is telling everybody that she thinks it was actually Sean. Why would she say something like that? You know, she's a miserable drunk who likes to cause trouble. Ugh. You know, I don't know what you ever saw in that girl. She's nothing but a filthy cochina. Well, whatever. I mean, I'm just saying, if you hear anything about it, that's all it was. God is gracious and good, patient, and rich in mercy to those who call on him with repentant hearts and lives. Divine mercy is of the utmost importance, and the church calls on us to implore it during the entire Lenten season with reflection, with prayer, and with penance. Remember, man is dust, and unto dust you shall return. Dear friends in Christ, let us ask our father to bless these ashes which we will use as the mark of our repentance. Remember thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return. Remember thou art dust, and unto dust though shalt return. Remember, Grace, thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return. Remember, Francis, thou art dust and unto dust thou shalt return. Remember thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return. Remember thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return. Hello, Grace. Good morning, Father. Francis Xavier, how are you? I'm good, I guess. Are you really? We need to talk. Meet me in the sacristy in five minutes. What the hell is going on? Is what I'm hearing true? No, not at all. Don't lie to me, Francis! I am in this as well. Hey, come on, Father. Do you think I'm going to lie to you about this? I mean, I'm... I'm just as confused as anybody. Then why is everybody in the parish talking about this this morning? Because you know and I know that Maggie Shea is a sloppy lush who's probably just looking to get me in trouble with Moran because I don't want to see her anymore. I mean, come on. You don't think it's any coincidence that she comes up with this bullshit? Watch your mouth. You don't think it's any coincidence that she comes up with this on the three-year anniversary of the shootings? OK, look, I'm sorry, Francis. I just wanted to make sure. I mean, I don't want to you get caught up in something again. I would hate that. You've been a good man these last three years and I don't want to lose you to the other side again. Don't worry about it. You're not, all right? It's not true. Hey, Red. Give me a whiskey. Can I ask you a few questions? You've got to be kidding me. Your old man would talk to me. Yeah, well, look where it got him. Hey, Maggie, sweetheart, come here. Fuck you, Polack. I don't care what the rest of 'em say. I still think you're a classy girl. Now, is it true that you had a visitor from beyond the grave last night? And why would I tell you if I had a visitor from anywhere? Because if you didn't, I could make your life very difficult. Do you know anybody over here who talks to the cops? Not many, but a few. Well you're not adding me to your list. What if I told you that if you told me there was some truth to the story, that it would be very helpful to me in putting Francis Sullivan behind bars for a long time? What would you think then? I think I'd still tell you to go fuck yourself. Francis Sullivan is a fuck, and I hope they fucking kill him, but I'm no rat. Did he hurt you that badly that you'd go and make up a crazy rumor like this? First, it ain't no crazy rumor. And second, he didn't hurt me. If he wants to fuck his brother's wife, that's his business. But he didn't hurt me. I can see why that might upset you. Oh, piss off, Polack. God bless you both. Thanks for all your help. Francis Sullivan, my old friend, how you doing? What's up, Moran? I was hoping you'd tell me. I got nothing for you. It's a bullshit rumor. He's dead. I hope you're not lying to me, Fran. What was that? I said, I hope you're not lying to me. Yeah. I've got God in my life now, you know? I don't lie to anybody. We all know how we feel about what happened at the Blarney Stone, right? Well it seems to me like that evened that score, don't you think? You know, that's what I was thinking. But now I'm hearing all this crazy stuff. You seem like a smart guy to me. I don't know why you're going to believe that kind of crap. You want to know why I might? Because if your brother was dead, and you thought I had something to do with it, I have a hard time believing you wouldn't have come after me already. Well, you know, I've got my own reasons for that, all right? Oh, yeah. I know. I heard you found God, and you're on the straight and narrow. Forgive and forget and turn the other cheek and all that Catholic school bullshit. You know what I think, Francis? I think it's a lot of crap. You watch your back. Not gonna be Whitey's neighborhood forever. I've got a feeling Whitey might feel differently about that, you know? You want to know what, Francis? I don't really give a fuck what Whitey thinks. I don't believe in ghosts. Look, it ain't him, all right? The guy is fucking dead. It's just some kid who looked like him. Well you remember the rumor that the guy they paid to do the hit was never heard from again. Wasn't heard from again because no one knew who he was in the fucking first place. They brought him in from the west coast. Why would they do that? I mean, let's cut the fucking shite. Why didn't Moron, or Moran as you yank bastards would say, just do it himself? Jesus, you're a stupid fucking mick. That's the old way of doing things. Sean Sullivan was from this fucking neighborhood. To have someone do the hit from this neighborhood? Can't do that. As long as Whitey Smith runs things around here, everyone, including Moran, got to play by his fucking rules. That sounds like a load of bollocks to me. When someone fucks with you, you take care of them yourself. Yeah, well, I don't know how they do shit in Ireland, but this is Hell's Kitchen. And we got fucking rules here. Yeah? Have you heard this bullshit about Sean Sullivan? Yeah, I just heard, too. You find out what the fuck is going on? All right, we'll look into it. Yeah, you fucking do that. Yeah. I'll call you after. What the fuck does Big Bear want? He wants us to go talk to Frannie, see what's up. Not for nothing, I don't like that guy Francis Sullivan either. What is your problem with Francis? He's the nicest guy around here. Not like the rest of you friggin' animals. His fucking face bothers me. Just relax yourself, tough guy. Unless you want to get yourself fucking killed. My. Don't you know who the father was? No. Who's his father? John Sullivan. That name ring a bell, moron? - I haven't a clue. He only controlled the docks over here for over 20 fucking years. He ran this fucking neighborhood. No one fucked with this man, not even the fucking guineas. He had the whole West Side in his hip pocket, and Frannie helped run the whole thing. Big fucking deal. Ancient history. So if him and his kid were such "tough guys," such hard fellas, why is this Francis working in a shitty little pub for now? Because after they killed his brother, that was it. He went clean. I still don't like his face. Yeah, well, you don't need to. Just make sure he likes yours. That day will come. Murph, can I get a beer? Francis, good thing you're back. I've gotta talk to you. What, is everyone telling you they're seeing ghosts? You heard? Yeah, yeah. It's just some guy that looks like him, all right? I wouldn't worry about it. OK, but there's this guy here. Been here all morning. Reading the paper, drinking tea. He say anything? Not a word. Got any idea who he is? No. All right. I wouldn't worry about it. OK. Hey, Pete, you cum-drunk degenerate. You still betting the gray mares? You're OK. Don't worry about it. Fran, what number you play yesterday? Same as always. Yeah, same as always. Now, you see, that didn't come in. Yeah, that never comes in, does it? Nah, but I was rooting for you. How's your brother doing? Hey, Murph, take care of this shyster, will you? Be careful, Paulie. US currency, Murph. No Roman coins, Methuselah. It's all right now, asshole. You can come out. It's only me. Don't call me that. Oh, don't call you that. Do you have any fucking idea what you're causing me today? What? Sit the fuck down. Did you sneak out last night while I was working? - No. - Don't lie to me, Sean. I got People all fucking day telling me that they saw you. That's bullshit. Who saw me? So you did go out. I wanted a drink. That's real, real fucking smart. So you go to Red Kelly's? What the fuck are you thinking? This is life and death we're dealing with, and you sneak out for a drink? Don't talk to me about life and death. It's not like it's you they're going to kill if they find out. Hey, the fuck it isn't! It's me, it's you, it's even Father Mahoney. And maybe even Grace. You think about that? If you needed a drink that badly, I would have brought you a fucking bottle from downstairs. I wanted some air. I'm sorry. So why not go out of the neighborhood? Go downtown where nobody would recognize you. I figured it was close. And besides, it's been three years. No one recognized me. Nobody recognized you, huh? For a guy wants to go to college, you're real fucking moron, you know that? So you talk to anybody while you were out having this drink? - No. - No? No, maybe not even Maggie Shea? Your old girlfriend? Hey, don't be a wise ass, you little prick. I'm not kidding around here. Yeah, all right. I ordered a drink from her. That's real fucking smart. You talk to anybody else? - No. - No, nobody? - No! - No? You didn't stop in the deli maybe after that? Yes. So? So now we've got Whitey Smith coming by my place this morning, asking me what the fuck you're doing back in the neighborhood, huh? And he's not going to be the last one sniffing around. Well, you fucking got me into this mess in the first place. Hey, I didn't get you into shit. I'm not the one who asked you to come back here unannounced. That's not what I'm saying. But I wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for you. I'd be finishing up college, living with Grace, thinking about getting out of here and getting a regular job. You fucked it up for me. So now you owe me. So don't fucking give me a hard time, all right? I don't have a life anymore. Jesus. You're not the one with no friends, living in weird towns where you don't know anybody. So I went out for a drink! Big fucking deal. I've been hiding out for three years. You don't know what that's like. I don't have anybody. It's worse than being dead. I just wanted to see the neighborhood again, you know? See people I knew. I didn't think anybody would recognize me, Frannie. I'm sorry. Let me do the talking, all right? All right. Let's go. What the fuck is wrong with you? Fucking tough. - What? - Tough guy. - Let me handle this, all right? - All right. Fucking Mick. Stupid ass, fucking Mick. Hey, Murph, how you been? How are you, James? How's your father? Good, good. Still slaving away for the sanitation department. Nothing wrong with an honest living, is there? No, nothing wrong with that. Yeah, we're looking for Francis. Is he here? Who's this? Name's Coleman, John Coleman. What, you heard of me? Should I? It depends, I guess. On what? Come on, Murph. You know why we're here. We just got to fucking talk to him. Is he around? I'll take a look. Keep and eye on the register, will you? Yeah, a lot of good we'll do. What the fuck you doing? I'm having a drink. Put it down. When it's free, it's welcome, you bollocks. Ah, Jesus. All right, go get in the bathroom. Yeah, who is it? Fran, it's Murph. Open up. What's up? A few of Moran's guys are here. Which ones? Burke and some other guy I don't know. They want to talk to you. All right. All right. Tell them I'll be down in a second. You just had to go out for a drink last night. Who was that? It was Murph. I got more guys in the bar downstairs asking about your reappearance. What the hell do you need that for? Because you don't listen to what you're told. Lock the door and keep your mouth shut. Hey, Burke, what can I do for you? You heard the rumor I guess. About the Sean look-a-like? Yeah. Some people don't think it's a look-a-like. I'm one of them. What do you want me to say? You know he's dead, I know he's dead. Why? What does Moran say? He don't fucking believe you. He wants us to ask around, see what you know. Is there something I can help you with, pal? No, I fucking doubt that. You tell Moran and if he needs me, I'm right here. Poor fella, just like I fucking thought. Come on. Let's go. No, no, no. I want to see this big fucking faggot's got. You're going to allow me to call you a queer in your own fucking pub? What the fuck is wrong with you? Let's go. - Don't worry about it, Burke. You and I both know what happens to guys like him. You'll see what I mean, kid. Have a nice fucking life. Have yourself a pop, Frank. Anything I can help you with? No, just drinking my tea and reading the paper. All right. You let me know if I can tell you with anything, all right? You good and comfortable? I'm fine. Good, good. So I'm going to end up getting my ass shot off because you needed a drink last night. Maybe I should just leave, then. Oh, yeah? And go where? I don't know. I'll go get Grace. We'll take off. I'm not a kid anymore. I don't really need your help. Good, good. Do me a favor, get the fuck out of here and save me the headaches, all right? Get the fuck out of here. - I don't want to. All right, good. Because from now on, you listen to what I say, OK? No more sneaking out for late night cocktails. Look, I already said I was sorry. I didn't know. Yeah, well, look, you know what? I'm sorry, too. Because now the neighborhood's not safe for you anymore. So what are we gonna do? I got a friend who lives out in Brooklyn. Maybe I'll take you out to her house for a couple of days. We'll hide you there until I can figure out how to get you out of town again. Just so you know, I'm not leaving without Grace. Yeah, well, just so you know, she doesn't know the truth. We never told her. What do you mean? How could you not tell her? Because the less she knew, the safer you'd be, and the safer she'd be. So she thinks I'm dead? Yeah. Well, if she thinks I'm dead, then maybe she might've gone with somebody else. Has she been with anybody else? No. Well how can you be sure? Because I know. How do you know? Hey, look, don't start with me, all right? I get a lot of bullshit going on right now without you all of a sudden playing the jealous husband. Did you? Did I what? Did you fuck her? What the fuck is wrong with you, Sean? What the fuck is wrong with you? That's your wife you're talking about, all right? Hey that doesn't answer the question. Who the hell do you think you're talking to, all right? I'm your brother. You don't talk to me like that. What, you don't want to answer the question? No, I don't want to answer the question, because she's your wife and you don't talk about her that way, all right? - You didn't do anything? You swear? You know what, Sean, fuck you, pal. You fucked her, didn't you? Hey, look, I'm not going to tell you again. She's your wife. You don't talk about her that way. You got me? Yeah. All right. I'm going to go out for a couple hours. Don't leave the fucking apartment. I'm not leaving without Grace. You and I both know what Maggie Shea is. OK? She did not see Sean last night, because Sean is dead. So I have to ask you, out of respect for me and my son, can you please stop telling people that you think you saw his espiritu or whatever? Pulaski. Hello, Father. What can I do for you? Oh, I've just got a few questions I thought you could help me with. Well, sure. Anything at all. I'm sure you heard about the reappearance of Sean Sullivan. Oh, yes. Some people claim he's risen from the dead. Or that he was never dead to begin with. Now, you know that he was responsible for the death of three men here in your parish three years ago. Three years ago to the day, in fact. That's right. It was Ash Wednesday. And if I remember my catechisms correctly, the ashes symbolize death, and remind us of our mortality and our need to repent before this life is over. Isn't that right? Very good. But, remember, the only redemption is with our Lord. But a lot can happen between now and that final judgment day. I'm not sure I get your point. Have you heard anything that might be helpful in locating young Mr. Sullivan, if he is, in fact, back from the dead? No, just the same rumors that you've heard, I'm sure. However, if he has risen from the dead, I would like to think that he would stop by the church. It might put me in better standing with the bishop. Well, if you do hear anything, please let me know. As you know, there's a few people out there who would like to see him dead, again. Did I do something to make you not trust me, Francis Xavier? No. What are you talking about, Father? You're not telling me the truth about Sean. What are you talking about? Today is what, Ash Wednesday, right? A day of penance, and you're going to lie to a priest. Francis, how long have I known you? You think I can't tell when you're full of crap? Come on, let's go out back. Hey, look, Father. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you involved again. I made a promise to your mother a long time ago that I'd always be involved. You know what? I'm a big boy now. Not so big that you can't use the help of Jesus. If Jesus wants to help, that's fine. I just don't want you involved again. Who helped you put your life together when everything went down three years ago? If it wasn't for me, you'd either be dead or in prison right now. So don't forget who you're talking to here, Fran. Now where the hell is Sean? You know what, look, where he is isn't important right now. Don't jerk me around here, Fran. Where is he? I got him in my room upstairs. Now that's not the safest place in the world, now is it, with everybody looking around? But then again, nobody'd think you were dumb enough to keep him up there. Does anybody else know he's back? I don't know. I got a visit from Whitey this morning. And a couple of Moran's guys came by, too. What in God's name made him come back anyway? I thought we made a deal. So did I. But he's a 21-year-old kid who's afraid of being alone. All right, so I get a phone call last night saying he's back in town. Then what am I supposed to do? He's my brother. I've got to put him up. Well why is he back? He came back for Grace, said he wants to take her out West. Said he's ready to settle down. Well that complicates things now, doesn't it? Does she know he's still alive? No. OK, then you and me, we've got to get him out of here again, and we've gotta do it before tomorrow. Well, he's not going without her. Well suppose she won't go. What then? A lot's happened between you two these last three years, hasn't it? Well, she's his wife. She'll go. Well, then one of us has to tell her. You know what? I think you'd probably be a little better at that than me, don't you think? No. But I'll do it. What's going on, Maggie? With you and Francis? I don't know. You tell me. Just answer the question. I don't know what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Look, Grace, I know everyone says that Sean's dead, and we were all at his funeral. But a guy came in here last night, and it was him. Now either he's back from the dead, or he was never dead to begin with. So it just couldn't have been some guy who looked like him? It's only been three years, Grace. I would know Sean if I saw him, and it was him. Well what did he say? Nothing. He ordered a drink. And I tried to talk to him, but he just got up, sat at a table back there, finished his drink and left. I don't care what she says, Grace. I saw him too last night, and it wasn't him. All right? He was just a kid off one of the ships, probably on shore leave. That's all. Look, you've heard the rumors, right? Hey, zip it, will you? No, tell me. What rumors? That it wasn't Sean's arm they found. That Francis really killed the guy that they sent to kill Sean, and that Fran cut him up and put Sean's watch and ring on the dead guy's arm, and tossed it in the river. And that he and Father Mahoney got Sean out of town. That's not true. Well that's the rumor. It's not true. He's dead. Don't be a fool, Grace. You know how Fran used to be. Go ask him yourself. Or ask Father Mahoney. He's a priest. He can't lie to you. Is it true? Grace, let me try to explain. What did I tell you about this guy? I told you he was no good. So he's alive. How could you not tell me that, Father? We did it to protect you and the child. It was done to keep you safe. To keep me safe? You lied to me. You told me that my husband was dead, and that I had to move on and raise little Seanie by myself. How was that OK? He was OK with that? No, no. He's... he doesn't know about little Sean. Then why did he come back? For you. After three years he just decides to come back? I'm just supposed to run off with him? Where has he been all this time? It wasn't safe for him before this. It still isn't. And now it's not safe for you or the kid either. Why? Because if... If certain people find out that he's alive, they're going to come looking for him, and the first place that they'll probably look is right here. So I think it's very important that we get you and little Sean out of the city tonight. Tonight? Yeah. That's what he wants if that's what you want. Where are we going to go? Wherever you want. Where's little Sean now? He's at Teresa's house. He's playing with little Tony. He should be back in an hour. Regardless of what you decide, you better go get him right now, bring him over to the church. You'll both be safer there until we can figure out what to do. Look, Grace, I'm sorry. I'm really... - Don't! - No, I am. I'm sorry, Grace. I couldn't do anything else. Where you been? He's been waiting for you. Hey, Fran. How's it going? What did you find out? It's nothing. Just Maggie Shea and her big mouth. There was some guy last night in the bar, he kind of looked like Sean. And now she's going around telling crazy stories. Why would she manufacture a story like that? I don't know. She's a bitter woman, I guess. So he's not back? No. I hope not. This could cause me a lot of unnecessary turmoil. Now, I helped you and your brother because I owed it to your father, but we had and fucking deal. Your brother was never to show his face in the neighborhood ever again. Now who else knows he's still alive? Same as always. Me, you, Father Mahoney. The wife doesn't know? No. I don't want a war with that little prick, Moran. But if your brother is back in the neighborhood, I'll have to look the other way. Do you understand? Because as your father said, the wages of sin must be paid. Get out of here. There he comes now. Well, Paulie, you sure about this? Just telling you what I heard. It's the word up on the avenue. Your uncle said you just get out of the service. Marine Corps. And this is what you want to do? If you cross this line, you don't go back. Come on, Charlie. This guy Sullivan killed my brother, Vinny. I want revenge. All right. Where can the kid find this Irish prick? I'll take him by the bar right now. You see that bar in the middle of the block over there? That's his Gin Mill. It's a shit hole. He's got the apartment upstairs. That's a shit hole, too. He should be up there. But if he's not, you go downstairs, you talk to Murph. Murph's the bartender. He should know where he is. What's this guy Sean supposed to look like? He's a chink about 6 foot 5 with flaming red hair. How do I know? Hey, pal, what's the guy supposed to look like? I haven't seen him in three years. I mean, he should be a walking compost heap with worms coming out of his face. What do they say he looks like? All right. Look. The word is he's wearing a pea coat and a knit cap. Like a sailor? Like a seaman, exactly. Trust me, no, this kid ain't no seaman. Now, his brother, Francis, and his friends, they're like psychotic cowboys. Rile 'em up, it's like John Wayne on acid. So watch yourself. How are you planning on handling this, anyway? Don't worry about it. I ain't worried. Semper Fidelis. How'd she take it when you told her? She was angry. She was confused. What do you expect? You think maybe I should go over there and try and explain things to her? Francis, as long as it's the last time and you both understand that. What do we do with Sean? Well, it's really not that complicated. We've just got to make sure that nobody else sees him. And then we get the three of them out of town as quick as possible, and that'll be the end of it. You have someplace you could hide Sean out of the neighborhood where Grace and I could meet you? Yeah, I was going to take him out to a friend's in Brooklyn. I'll take him there. - All right. That's good, that's good. But you know what'll happen if they see him. Yeah, they'll kill him And then kill you. So you'd better be very careful. Are you kidding me? You know, I don't even want to fucking see you, you fucking son of a bitch. How could you not tell me. How could you not tell me? Calm yourself now, all right? How could you do that? Don't tell me to calm down. Do not tell me to calm down. You lied to me. You lied to me this morning. Look. I did it to protect you, all right? Same reason I didn't tell Sean anything. I did it to protect you. And what did you tell him? Because I know you didn't tell him about Seanie. The same thing you're going to tell him, all right? What? Nothing. How am I supposed to face him? Did you even think about that? Hey. Hey, all right? Look. Come on, you know. We were there for one another during a tough time to help each other out, all right? There's nothing wrong... there's nothing wrong with that. It was OK. What's so OK about it? I fell in love with you. That is not OK, Frances. Well, you know what, look, that doesn't matter any more. All right? I mean, it doesn't matter. What matters now is Sean is back, and he's your husband, and he's the father of your son, and that's all there is to it. All right? That's all there is to it. And you have to go back with him, and you know it. What am I supposed to tell him? Nothing. I mean, there's nothing to discuss. All right, I mean, what we had together is just for us. All right? That means nobody can ever know. I mean, that means Sean can never know, and that means you and I go to the grave with it. All right? How could you not tell me he was alive? Look, you know, I mean, I meant to a thousand times. I just... I didn't know how. I'm so disappointed in you. Well, look. What are you going to do? Are you going to go with him or not? You know what? You were no good when I met you, and you're still no good. It's time to go. What the hell are you doing? You wear that last night? - Yeah. Well then put something else on. I don't want to take a chance anyone's gonna recognize you. Put your hood on, too. All right, come on. Let's go. What do you need, a formal invitation? Get in the fucking car. Let's go. This is the place. Come on. Fucking girl said she'd be home by now. What, you don't have a key? No, I don't have a fucking key. Fuck! All right, come on. We'll wait in the car. Ah, Detective Pulaski. Whitey. The usual? Oh, no. Your man has already taken care of me. Then I assume you're here to talk to me about the supposed reappearance of Sean Sullivan. Amazing, isn't it? Fucking guy picked a religious holiday to rise up from the dead. Yes, well, those Sullivans were always good Catholics. A few folks around here might disagree with you there. But never to my face. I've come by for one reason... I don't want to see any more bloodshed in this neighborhood, and if we can do something to prevent that, I'd like to. Well as the poet said, you're overflowing with excreta. There's nothing you would like better than to see the blood of the last Sullivan flow into the Hudson. That has nothing to do with it. I'm just not a big fan of murdering scumbags. I like to see them behind bars. The only bars I want to see the Sullivans behind are mine. Young Sullivan is well dead, and I know that for a fact. So how long you owned that bar? A couple of years now. What else do you do? What do you mean, what else do I do? I'm there seven nights a week. What, you don't do anything else? What, you got a problem with that? No, I'm just saying you used to have a bunch of other stuff going on. Like the king of the neighborhood. Look, Sean, I wasn't the king of shit. Yeah you were. Everybody thought so. Well everyone didn't know shit, all right? Whitey Smith ran the neighborhood. The old man worked for him, and I worked for the old man. The only thing I did was throw away the first 30 years of my life. But, still, I mean, you could still do something with your life now, right? What, are you fucking judging me now? I'm not judging you. I'm just saying, you know, remember when we were kids? We had all those dreams? We were going to start that trucking company, right? Use dad's connections, drive all across the country. Meet girls from California. You can still do that. You're fucking unbelievable, kid. We got people chasing us, looking to kill us, and you're talking to me about fucking trucks and girls from. California. You'd better get your fucking shit together, all right? This ain't make-believe here. Yeah, all right. Yeah, all right. Excuse me. Excuse me. Is there something I can do for you, buddy? I'm looking for Sean Sullivan. Sean Sullivan? Sean's been dead for about three years. Maybe I can do something else for you. How about his brother, Francis? He's not here. Not upstairs, by any chance? Like I said, he's not here. You got a bathroom. You want to use the bathroom, buy a drink. All right. Give me a beer. It's in the back. Thanks, pal. What was Mom like when she died? Well, she was pretty sick. What was the funeral like? It was a funeral. People were sad. I can't believe I wasn't there for that. Did you ever tell her the truth about what happened to me? No. But Father Mahoney did. And besides, she said she already knew. You know, you could never get anything over on Mom. Unfortunately, after dealing with the old man for all those years, nothing we could do would ever surprise her, so. How do you figure a sweet woman like Mom ever fell for a guy like Dad? Power is attractive And he was a good dancer, remember? That's what she always used to say. "If only I'd never seen him dance that night, what a different life I would have." Oh, yeah. For a fucking psycho, he was pretty impressive. How come you always used to think that Dad favored me? What was that all about? I don't remember. What about Mom? Who was her favorite? You were her favorite, too. See, I don't think so. I think they both favored you. I mean, why else would Dad ask you to go to work for him? He kept talking to me about going away, going to college, and getting out of the neighborhood. Because he knew that working for him and living that life was the best that I was ever going to do. You know, but he knew that you were too smart. He knew that he didn't want you wasting your life being a fucking asshole like the rest of us. What's weird is that I wanted to be just like you and dad. Well, I got news for you... unfortunately, now you are. How do you figure that? You've got to look over your shoulder everywhere you go, don't you? I don't fucking believe this. Yeah, I'll call you. You sure it was him? I'm not going to say it again. It was him. Son of a bitch. I want you two to go find out if this scumbag is still alive. Personally, I think we're wasting our fucking time. This is all bullshit. We're making ourselves crazy over nothing. She didn't see a fucking thing. Fuck you! No, fuck you! Shut up! Where the fuck else could Frannie be hiding him? I don't know. We checked all the usual places. But we're not going to find him, because Sean is fucking dead. I know a place. Any time we got into a fight, Fran used to go out to Brooklyn to see some slut. He didn't think I knew, but I knew. Thinks he's so fucking smart. I followed him out there one night. Jesus, She was a fat fucking cow, too. Jesus Christ. You know, I wonder if this has got anything to do with the fact that Frannie won't have anything to do with you anymore, huh? - Fuck you, Jimmy. No, fuck you, Maggie! I know what I saw. Shut the fuck up! Shut up, You give these two shitfucks the address. You go out there. And if you find something, you fucking call me. Where the fuck is this girl already? Who is this girl, anyhow? It's just a girl. Don't worry about it. Is she pretty? Is she fucking pretty? I don't fucking know. I mean, you know, she's all right, but she's no beauty. Are you going to marry her? No. She's just a girl I used to hang out with. I'm not going to marry her. Don't you want to have kids? Didn't we go through this already? No, you never told me why you didn't want to have kids. Because chances are I'm not going to be around that long. What do you mean you're not going to be around that long? Where are you going? Where am I going? I'm joining the fucking Peace Corps. Where do you think I'm going? You're unbelievable, Sean. I swear, you know, when we were kids, everyone was saying you were a small one. I must have been coming off like a real fucking retard. No, you seem smart to me. I seem smart to you? Thanks a lot. Come on. You want to go across the street and get a drink? Is it safe? Of course it's safe. It's only Brooklyn. Come on. You're old enough to drink now, right, kid? Very funny. Days grow shorter and the nights are growing long... You grab a table in the back. I'll get a couple of beers. Feels like we're running out of time. Hey, buddy, let me get two beers. Why are you always defending this guy, Sullivan? Because I know Maggie Shea is full of shit. I've known Fran Sullivan my whole life. We did our first communion together, confirmation. In high school, we went to work for his old man. We even did our time together. Jesus, sounds like you're in love with the guy, for fuck's sakes. No. I'm jealous of him. He got out of this shit. He's got a life now. Well, I have a feeling we might take it away from him. Hey, pal, if you need anything else, let me know. I was thinking maybe we could go see Mom's grave tonight. Do you not understand what's going on here? If these guys find us, they are going to kill us, all right? We don't have time to go see Mom's grave. Why not? We're already in Brooklyn. I don't give a fuck where we are, all right? Just forget about it. You want to see Mom, you want to talk to her, you go to a church and say a prayer. Why do you have to get so pissed all the time? Because you keep asking me all these stupid fucking questions about going out to see Mom's grave, and you know what's going to happen? You're going to end up going to see it for real. You want that? No. So what's the plan? How are we going to get Grace? All right. As soon as she gets to Father Mahoney's, all right, he's going to drive her out here. When she gets here, the two of you take my car, you get out of here. I don't give a fuck where you go, you never come back. All right? I can't believe this is going to work. You know how much I've missed her, Fran? What does she look like now? Is she still beautiful? Look, I don't know. She's your wife. I don't look at her that way. You can still tell me if she's beautiful or not. Yeah, you know, she's beautiful. Oh, man. I can't wait to see her. I've missed her so much, Frannie. So you're not going to go unless she goes with you, huh? I can't. All right then. Do me a favor. Stop asking me all these stupid fucking questions about going to see Mom's grave, and I guarantee I'll get you out of here, with her, tonight. I wonder if she doesn't love me anymore. I mean, we were 18 when we got married. Everything happened and I had to get out, you know? It was a long time ago. She was young. What if she forgot about me? She didn't forget about you. Are you sure there was no one else? She didn't forget about you, all right? What if she changes her mind when she sees me, doesn't want to go? You know what? Then I'm going to be pissed off, because I had to get my ass shot off for nothing. What kind of a life do you think you're going to have, always on the run, living with criminals? He's my husband, Ma. I can't abandon him. He abandoned you! Say goodbye to grandma. I'm glad you came. He's not here, is he? No. Good. I have to talk to you. Certainly, go on in. What is it, Grace? I put my wedding rings back on. I wasn't going to, but now I don't want to take them off. And I don't know what that means, because I feel really terrible. Father, I'm so confused. What if when I thought he was dead, I did some things that I wouldn't have done otherwise? Is it over now? Yeah. Then keep it to yourself and get on with the rest of your life. I'm not sure if I can do that. I'm really scared, Father. I know he's my husband, but I don't know if I can go with him. You don't have to go with him, Grace. But you should know that Sean won't leave without you. And you have to remember that little Sean is his son, too. I know it's a difficult decision, a very hard one. But you have to make one. Whatever happened to the guy they sent to kill me? What do you think happened to him? You killed him. Look, I just did what I had to do. What about the arm? What about it? You know that was the watch that dad gave me that you put on it? Who gives a fuck? If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with. How do you figure that? Because if I never went to go work for him in the first place, I'd be living a real fucking different life right now, and so would you. What was so bad about working for him? What did you do, anyway? You know that every time I walk out of the bar after work, my body tenses up? You know, I keep expecting someone to run up behind me and put a fucking bullet in my head, because they found out that I killed their brother, killed their father. All right? Every time I walk around the neighborhood, I see people that remind me of the terrible shit that I did. You know Mrs. Diaz in the deli? All right? I killed her son because he owed Whitey Smith a couple of thousand dollars. Red Kelly's father, Bill? Me and the old man threw him off a roof on the avenue because ratted one of the guys in Dad's local. All right? That's the kind of fucking shit I walk around with. Jesus. You mean, you and dad killed people together? What did you think, I was fucking helping him with his paper route? There's a lot of shit you don't know, Sean, all right? So do me a favor. Stop asking all these fucking questions. Please. Jesus, is that his car? I don't think so. - All right, should we go up? - Yeah. Why don't you go fucking knock. I'll wait here. Jesus, Burke. Do you know what a Burke is in Ireland? No, what's a Burke in Ireland? It doesn't fucking matter. Just get out. Fuck you, you bollocks. Hopefully this chick is home by now. They're right fucking there! Ah, fuck! Come on. Let's go! Oh, shit! Come on, go. Fuck! Hold up a second. Hold up. I think I fucking got him. Where the fuck are we? All right. Come on. Now get in the fucking car, will you? Burke, what the fuck are you doing standing there? Move your hole! Fucking Jesus! That motherfucking cunt of a fuck shot me! You just had to come back to town, right? You couldn't call or write a fucking letter? You fucked up, Sean. You know, you fucked up big time! Fuck you! I saved your life. You and your fucking gambling debts. Did I ever ask you to do anything for me, ever? What else was I supposed to do? You're my fucking brother! They were going to kill you. I'm one who gets to put the bullet in this fucking guy's head. You mean to tell me this guy's old man, the John Sullivan? And they're all right with this? Real fucking mad. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I've done a terrible thing. Well, Francis and I came up with a plan to get Sean out of town that night. We got him some fake ID, we put him on a bus at Port Authority. He wound up in Texas and he's been there ever since. I don't even know him. How can I run away with him? What does the church say? I don't really know, Grace. But I do know that Sean did it out of love and fear for his brother's life, and that he's not a murderer like his father was. Or in the way that Francis was. Right. Why do you keep helping them? I'll tell you something I never told anyone before. Maybe it will help. I don't know. When I was 20 years old, I went in the seminary. And I went in because a priest in my parish was willing to give me a second chance. I did a horrible thing. I was young and foolish, but I thought that I was protecting someone that I loved. And it was a mistake, but he told me that God would forgive me. Take little Sean to the rectory and stay quiet. - OK. - Oh, my god. So now they know. Look, Francis, you can't bring him here, then. I mean it's not safe. They'll think of that. Is there someplace you could take him just for a few hours until I can figure out what the hell to do? I'll take him back to the city to my uncle's, but you've gotta talk to her, Father. You've got to convince her that if she doesn't go with him, there's going to be a lot of dead bodies. All right. Come on. Let's go. What did he say? She's not there yet. Is she OK? Yeah, yeah, she's fine. She's, you know, just not there yet. Let's go. Come on. You're gonna wait here. All right. Let's go. Who is it? It's Frannie. It's Frannie. Open up. Anybody else in here with you? Who the hell a else would be in here with me? Seanie. Seanie, let's go. Seanie? Get in the fucking room. Come on. What the hell do you think? Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Is that you, Sean? Yeah, it's me. What are you, back from the dead? Look at you! No, no, I was never dead. I just had to get out of town. You little prick. I knew you weren't dead! I knew it! I knew it! Sit down, sit down. Take a load off. What have you been doing? Where've you been? Living in Texas. Working on a farm. A farmer? A farmer from Hell's Kitchen? What do you grow? Who gives a shit what he grows? Wheat. It's wheat. He grows wheat! Hey, hey, but you know, you know, you ought to grow something that you can eat, like potatoes. Will you shut the fuck up with the farming, all right? We need your help here. Hey, Jesus was a farmer. Or a baker. Shut your mouth and sit down. All right. Now, If anybody comes here, you keep the door locked, you don't let them in. You've just got to make sure that he can get out through the fire escape. If that happens, I want you to go up to the roof, crossover to the 10th Avenue side, and make it over to the church. All right? - Hey, hey, hey. What about me? What about... what am I supposed to do? What do you mean, what about you? Don't worry about you, all right. Why don't you get the kid a drink or something. Make yourself useful. Whose freaking house is this anyway? Just get him the drink. All right. Come on. Let's go. This is going to be it for us, OK? I've got to go and, you know, you're not going to see me again. What do you mean I'm not going to see you again? I've got to get you out of town as soon as possible, all right? I'm not coming with you. Why not? Did I not get you into enough trouble already? Besides, after you've gone, you know, I've got to take care of some things to make sure this is over for good. But what I need you to do is promise me you'll take care of Grace. - Yeah, of course. - No, I'm serious. You've got to take care of her. Uncle Jim, all right. No matter what, he doesn't leave this apartment until you hear from me. No shit. Why did this have to happen to us? I don't know, man. We're paying for the old man's sins, probably. No hug, eh? Ain't gonna happen. We're Irish, remember? Can you believe this fucking ballbag shot me? Stop whining. You only got grazed. Good thing his aim wasn't better. It was him, right? You saw him? You're sure it was him? Me? I don't know. I only saw the back of his head. Was it him, or wasn't it? Make up your thick fucking skulls. Of course it was him. Why else would they take off? And besides, I got a good look at him. And it was him. And that motherfucker is going to pay for this. You're fucking right he's going to pay. I don't give a fuck who his daddy was. Well is it gonna be you or is it gonna be me? I mean, what's the story? Dear Lord, I don't know if what I'm doing is the right thing. But like you gave me a second chance, help me to give these boys another chance. Please guide me, and forgive me if I'm going against your will. Father Mahoney. Francis! Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. I was able to get him over to my Uncle Jim's. Kid and her still in the rectory? Yeah. She's agreed to go with Sean. Good. That's good. That's good, right? Yeah, but Francis, this is it for you and me. Now that they spotted Sean, there's going to be more bloodshed and you know it. And I can't be a part of it anymore. After tonight, you're on your own. Come on. Let's get going. Hey, Grace. Is Sean with you? He's actually at my Uncle Jim's. I've got the church van parked out back. I figured I'd drive them out of state, put them on a bus, and take them to wherever he wants to go. All right, well, you know where my Uncle Jim's is, right? Yeah. Well, look, why don't you drive them over there, I'll call over there, and he'll meet you at the back alley? OK. I'll let you two say goodbye. Come here, Sean. Oh, there you go. Let's just make this quick, OK? Look, you know I wish it was me that was going with you, right? But it's just... I don't know. This feels like the first time in my life I'm doing the right thing. We're both doing the right thing. All right. I guess that's it, then. Yeah. Come on, Grace. It's clear. Whitey, I know you were very close with their father. I respect that. And I respect the way you used to do things in the neighborhood. But that's the past. The neighborhood has changed. That kid killed my brother and my cousin that night in the Blarney Stone. Shot them in the back. Now, I know he was looking out for his big brother. But it wasn't his place. And it wasn't your place to go after Fran without my OK. I might give you that. But if that kid is still alive, I want him. And I don't want any interference. Otherwise, we might have some real trouble. I know we don't want that, Whitey. OK, I'll make you a deal. But let me tell you, it wasn't the kid. Oh, fuckin' Whitey. Trust me, I know. A lot of people doubt that the kid is dead. Let me tell you, my own brother was killed, so I know how it is with you. Here's what I propose. If it's revenge, then do what you have to do with Fran. And I'll look the other way. You'll stay out of it? I give you my word. But that has to be the end of it. Or you'll experience more fucking trouble than you can imagine. Well that'll be the end of it, then. Call over to Sullivan's. Get me Cullen on the phone. Yeah? Your name Cullen? You got a call. Just so you know, we normally don't let people we don't know take personal calls here. Yeah. I got him. It's me. You know what to do. Sean, let's go. - Father, how are you? - I'm fine, Sean. Just get in the van. Oh, baby! I've missed you so much. I missed you, too. I can't believe you're alive. I'm so sorry I had to go away. I promise you, I'll never leave you again. Who's this little guy? That's Seanie. That's little Seanie. Mine? Hey, baby. Say hello to your daddy. Hey. Oh. Who hit that ball? Vic Wertz. Indian first baseman. Would have been a home tun in any other... Francis. How are you, son? I've been waiting for you. Hey, Polaski. What can I do for you? Answer a couple questions. No, my brother is not back from the grave. And no, he wasn't drinking at Red Kelly's last night. And, no, I haven't seen him either. So you've heard the rumors. Yeah. I've heard the rumors. That's all you're going to get, too. Well, I'll be keeping an eye on you, just the same. You do that. I'm only trying to help you, Fran. I don't want to see you get your head blown off. You know, I don't need your fucking help. Never have. This is some fucking neighborhood, huh? OK, Francis. Have it your way. Put your money away. It's no good here. Put that in the cup, Murph. You know, Murph, I think we're going to close up early tonight, all right? I don't mind staying late. Nah, nah. Let's just call it a night, OK? Whatever you say, Fran. Thanks. All right, folks. We're closing early tonight. Ha! Get a move on. Hit the bricks. What do you want to do about our tea-drinking friend here? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Have a good night, Murph. Hey, pal, maybe you didn't hear, but I said we're closing up now. Yeah, yeah, I heard. Let me take a leak first. You mean you've gotta use the bathroom? I've gotta use the bathroom. OK. Closing early tonight, Frannie? Yeah, what can I do for you, Moran? I keep hearing this rumor your kid brother is back in town. Rumor won't go away. I told you before. I don't know why you listen to rumors, especially ones spread by drunken ex-girlfriends. You know there's this other rumor, too. They're having some trouble out in Brooklyn tonight. Brooklyn? Yeah. What the hell would I be doing in Brooklyn? It was you, you fucking cunt. See, your brother killed my brother, my cousin. And now the question is coming up again as to whether that debt's been properly settled or not. Only by you, my friend. Only by you. You silly fuck. You think you can make a fool out of me in my own neighborhood? Because this is my neighborhood now. I went to see your old friend Whitey Smith, and you know what he told me? No, I haven't a clue. What'd he say? He said, "You do what you got to do with Francis Sullivan. I'll stay out of it." Makes sense to me. I mean, he sold out his yes man, right? I guess he's gonna sell out his yes man's kid. George, it's OK! It's OK! It's cool, it's cool! I'm with you guys. - It's OK. He's with us. You took your fucking sweet time there, didn't you? I figured you were going to go for him first. Are you kidding me? I almost shit myself here. All right, Burke, give us a hand. Let's get these mutts outta here. I can't believe that fucking worked. That was fucking genius. Settle yourself down, all right? We've got to get these two out of here ASAP. You got any big knives? We'll cut them up. Yeah, I got some. We can take them both out in the back. My car's out there. Make sure you thank Whitey for me, all right? Don't worry about it. He's wanted Moran dead for a long time All right. Let's get them out of here. Let's get him first. I'm gonna need a fucking chainsaw cut him up. Please be my vision Lord of my heart. Nothing else matters, save that you are. You're in my best of day into night. Waking or sleeping your presence, my light. Please be my wisdom, be my true word. I'm ever with you and you're with me, Lord. You're my great father I your true son. You're in me dwelling and I'm with the one. Please be my breastplate, my sword to fight. Please be my armor, please be my might. Lord, my sole shelter. Lord my high tower. Please raise me homeward, power of power. Riches I don't need, nor man's empty praise. Lord, you're my inheritance through all of my days. You and you only, first in my heart. High king of Heaven, my treasure you are. You're high king of heaven. When battle is done grant heaven's joy to me, bright heaven's sun. Christ of my own heart whatever befall. Still be my. vision the ruler of all.
