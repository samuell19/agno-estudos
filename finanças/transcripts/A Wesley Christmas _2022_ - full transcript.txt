I'm so happy that all the kids are coming home for Christmas this year. Yeah. Yeah. What? It is just that we're gonna have a lot of loud folk in our house and now, now we can't even walk around naked for the holidays. Well, we have never done that. Well, it's on my bucket list. - Ew! - What you mean, ew? I don't wanna see that. You done seen it. You like it. Have you talked to the kids? I'm just worried that Chris and Trina and the twins won't come because he's mad at Todd. Hey, what about your crazy brother? Huh? Dr. Quack. Don't call him that. He eccentric. He's a quack. Yes. He'll be here too. Yeah. With his latest work. Yeah. Sweetheart, Sweetheart, listen. I love our family, but they are a lot. Listen, next Christmas, me and you take a little trip to the island. And we'll zoom all them. No, we gonna be here with our family. I, I don't wanna see 'em. Oh, wait a minute. Look, look. It's our song, baby. Oh, sugar sugar now. What you wanna do about it? Oh, you better come here. Oh, what, what? I like that. Yeah. Now watch this. Watch this one. Bryan, do you think this tree is crooked? No? No, I don't think so. Yeah. Maybe a couple more ornaments on the left side. I'll tell you what, I'll get the box I hid in the office closet. I didn't think you'd notice. What, what? It's a lot of work hanging all those things. So we hiding things now? No. I'm not hiding anything. I'm, I'm just gonna get the box. Thank you big papa. You welcome, mama. I knew I wasn't crazy. Hey dad. How you doing old man? I'm, I'm good. I'm good. Listen, I can't talk very long. I really need you to do something for me. Of course. What is it, Dad? Sweetheart, I need this to be between us. What is it? Cydney, I know you. Can you keep your mouth shut? You know I will. Now, what is it, Dad? Bryan! Yes, dear! I gotta go. I'll call you back. Hey, Cyd. What's up, little sister? Hey you. Have you spoken to dad lately? Yeah, I spoke to him earlier today. Why? He's acting weird. Some secret, but he had to go before he could share. And you're sharing it already. Damn, Cyd. You can't hold water. Whatever, Chris. Dad's a senior citizen. He ain't supposed to be keeping secrets. I'm sure you'll figure it out. I'm already dealing with some other family mess. Oh, what did the twins do? It's not the twins. Trina? No. Then what's the problem? Your dumb-ass brother. Duh. I have two. What did Todd do now? Oh nothing. Just another bad business decision. You know, I don't know why I went into business with him. Stop whining. You guys need to work on your communication skills. Yeah that will work with someone reasonable, not some impulsive act. You know what? I gotta go. Oh, okay. I'll see you at mom and dad's later? Maybe. I love you, sis. Maybe? Hey! Hey, Mr. Elkins. What's going on, man? How you doing? Why we gotta go through this every year? You know me. I'll slide you a VA check. Come on, man. Good morning to you too. Chris. Can you hear me? I can hear you, babe. How are you? I'm good. I talked to Mama Sylvia this afternoon about the Christmas plans. Here we go. Chris, I really think that we should go. See if we go, I can't promise you I won't try to kill Todd. Look, let's stay home and have a small chill Christmas. Come on, babe. We cannot not go to your parents this year. It's traditions. Babe. The twins are going to college next year. What do we do if this fails? I hear you, but. Trina, Todd lost a half a million dollars. Wait, what? A half a million dollars? I didn't, I didn't know that it was that much. Yes, all of our company reserves. Well, can you get the money back? Look, I don't know. I mean, it leaves us with little to no operating capital. All over an app. An app? Is there anything that you can do? I'm looking into it. And that's why I think we should just stay home and have a nice quiet Christmas. Just me, you and the girls. I'm tired of- - Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. Just come home, okay? All right, babe. I'll see you soon. Yo, Janelle, you really leaving me? Baby, are you serious? I told you this was temporary. Look, baby. What I'm trying to build is gonna be big. Baby boy, I gave you three years. And what do we have to show for? Nothing. Now, baby what about last night? That's never been the problem, Todd. The problem is I'm tired. I'm still here, and you're still what, chasing dreams? Baby, I'm chasing dreams for us. Look, what I'm trying to build is gonna take us over the top. Really? Todd, you said that about the last two investments. They failed. They all failed. That was during the pandemic. What do you want me to do, babe? Wait. Hey, look at me. Listen, I got you. Just stick it out with me just a little bit longer and I promise you I got you. Please. Todd, I need more than just, "I got you." We're just not evenly yolked. Do you mean equally yolked? Whatever, you get the point. We don't fit anymore. Look, look at me. I'm sorry, but... I think this is for the best. You'll always have a special place in my heart. Just not in my life anymore. I'm sorry. I'll send for the rest of my things. Okay? Merry Christmas. Not right now, Cydney. Of course I enjoy spending time with you, Jefferson. What am I supposed to? I can't tell. I mean, you going away for the holidays and you know I want to spend the holidays with you. I'm gonna miss you. Aw, Jefferson. I know. I'm gonna miss you too over the holidays. But I told you I have to spend time with my family. It's our tradition. I have to go home. No, I know. It's just, Cyd. I think I'm falling in love with you. Oh. What was that, Jeff? Oh wait, hold on a second. Hello? Hey, beautiful. How you feeling? I'm fine, Omar. How are you? Not as half as fine as you girl. Which is why I want to come see you this week and do some of this holiday shit. You'll be in DC right? Yes, but you know I have to spend time with my family for Christmas. Look, we'll catch up soon. Oh, come on. You say that like you didn't enjoy when we caught up the last time. Oh, hey Omar. I gotta go, I have company. Merry Christmas. Hey, Jeff? Hello? Yeah, I gotta go. Merry Christmas! Hey, girl. What's up? Look, I need a break. And from the sound of your calls, sound like you need a break too. I just don't understand these men. Don't push me for more if I'm not pushing you. Cyd. You are a real pimp. girl. Geez. I'm not a pimp. I'm just clear. I have a way I like to move. And until I'm ready to settle down, I'm cool. I will enjoy my friends until my man comes in. Oh. Okay. And you have a starting five. That's right. And each one plays a different position in my life. Girl. Look, don't judge me, Ryan. I'm clear with all of them. Mostly. Hmm. Mostly. So you still going to Jamaica? Well, it's not Jamaica. It's St. Thomas. Ooh, Christmas in St. Thomas. Nice. Would be nice if he would just find his passport in time. He said he lost it earlier today. You don't need a passport for St. Thomas. Oh? Let me just... Hey hun. So what are we gonna do? It's too late to get a new one. Dang. Well, we can always stay here together. Or we can go to Cydney's family house in DC for the holiday. I was thinking of driving to Ohio to my brothers. Oh, okay. So when do we leave? I was gonna go up with my sister. Your sister? I didn't even realize you had a sister. Got an idea. You go to Cyd's parents and I'll go to my sister's. I mean, my brother's with my sister. Maybe we can hook up on New Year. You know what? I see what this is. Just have a good time. There you go. Let me keep looking. Damn, woman. Okay. But just re- Do not start, Cyd. I'm gonna send you my parents' address, just in case. And I'll head out later. Thanks girl. I really appreciate it. Mhmm. I hope I don't need it. Oh wait. That's ugly. I would not wear that. - I would. - I like this one. - But it's- - But that's not my color. I feel like that color, mm. No. Hey girls, can you do me a favor? Yeah sure, Mom. What's up? I got a migraine coming on. Can you finish up the kitchen from me? Sure, Mom. Sure, Mom, like for real? For real, sure Mom? Yes. Like you're not gonna talk about me and call me the evil stepmom? No! All right. Thank you. Put it on my tab. Okay. So Taryn, tonight we're straight, right? Ken, why do you always do this to me? You know they'll kill us if they come in there and you're gone. Taryn, come on. Malcolm is going away for Christmas. We won't see each other for like 10 days. I mean, I know it's a risk, but if they catch us, I'll just take all the blame. You always say that. Then I always found myself on punishment with you. I won't get caught. Besides, I just told you. 10 whole days. Also, I need you to style me. Ken, I don't even know why you're so pressed. I don't see Malcolm trying to plan to come see you. Taryn, this is the only Christmas gift I want from you. Fine. Thank you. Bryan. He's here! I'm coming. - Hey princess! - Mommy! Yo! There she is! Hey mom, how are you? There's my baby girl. Oh, my favorite daughter. Hey dad. Dad, I'm your only daughter. Oh yeah, that's right. Mom. I was just checking to see if there was any romance. Nothing has changed. Oh, and it seems nothing has changed here either, huh? Oh, no. No. He is, he's quite the character. - I see. - He's cray-cray. Are you hungry? - You know I'm hungry. - Okay, let's go. - Oh yeah! - Bags. Excuse me. You cannot park here. What's the problem? You're blocking my access. Don't you have better things to do, like go take a shower or something? Yeah, like having your car towed. You would have more space if you would move those damn cones. If you don't move your car, I'm a have it towed. Whatever. Oh fine. What? Fine. How do y'all live next to that crazy man? Cydney? I had no idea you'd be here so early. Honey, how you doing? I'm good. Auntie Glo. And you look fabulous as ever. Thank you, baby. You know, your Aunt Glo has to keep it together 'cause I am looking for my next husband. Who wants a drink? It's 10:00 AM, way too early. Well, it's 6:00 PM somewhere, and guess what? We're all good and grown and I'll make enough for everybody. You and your husband were always early drinkers. Good morning ladies. Hey daddy. Bloody Mary's in the morning and Vodka Collins at noon. So y'all need to do research. Research? What are you talking about? Now, I'm a retired physician. I never read any research that promotes consuming alcoholic beverages all day, every day. Well Bryan, you wouldn't know nothing about that 'cause you were a pediatrician. - Eh. - Anyway. A cocktail in the morning activates the neurons in the gray matter of the brain that stimulates and invigorates all thought processes throughout the day. You don't make no sense. Listen, you still drive that white Lexus? Mhmm. I forgot. That's the reason I came down. You're about to be towed. Oh, hell no. This man gonna make me kill him. - It's gonna be a fight. - I wanna see. Come on, hook it up. Get it outta here. - Wait! - Gloria. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on. It's okay. What's going on? Ask him. Yeah, Mr. Elkins. Hold on please. I told her if she did not move it, I was gonna have it towed. It was blocking my driveway. I'm barely blocking his space. Yeah, Glo, you are blocking his driveway. Come on! I cannot get my camper through that little space. Ma'am, just move your car a few inches so we can all go. But he can't even move it anyway. He can't move it. Come on. Please don't. Wait. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You are such an ass. You are such an- - Glo, Glo. Stop, stop, stop. Okay, all right. Just go back in the house. Make me a Bloody Mary. Please, please. You are such an ass! You're just evil. Evil! Well, Cydney, do you know how to cook? - Yes, I know how to cook. - Oh really? Mom. I make cereal. Cereal? Yes. Cereal. Oatmeal? No, cereal with the milk. Oh, child bless your heart. You haven't taught her how to cook? Yes, I can cook! Any luck with sexy and 60? Not really. You know, I think I'm too much for these old men. I should go younger. What y'all think? These young boys wouldn't know what to do with all this. Hey, son. What up, mama? How you doing? I'm good. Hi. Good to see you. - Hi Todd. - Hey Auntie. Good to see you baby. Good to see you too. Sup, Cyd? Todd. How you doing, son? I was worried about you. I don't know. I just never expected her to actually walk out on me. You know who you married, right? Look, all marriages go through something, but I just, I don't know. I figured she might stick around and try and figure it out with me. I just can't figure out where I went wrong. Now Todd, I told Sylvia I never liked that girl. She had hussy written all over her. And then she had the nerves to- - I know how much you love Janelle, son. Well, I always thought she was a gold digger. I told you that as soon as I met the skank. Cydney, your brother is suffering. No need to add fuel to the fire. You're right. I just feel so bad for you, Todd. That, and Chris being so pissed off at you. Do y'all know he may not come this year? All because of you and your shady business moves. Rough time right now, bruh. Yeah. Real rough time. Hey, speaking of rough time, how's that music career of yours going? Oh, it's not? Dang. That sucks, man. I wanted you to go. That's crazy. Shut up. You shut up. Don't you tell me what to do to do. You can't tell me to do anything. Auntie, get her, please. Uhuh. Here you go, baby. It's gonna be all right. Anybody else want a bloody Mary? We do! Hey. Good morning, Sis. Family! What's up with you, uncle? Family! - Hi, uncle. - What's up Cyd? How you doing? You looking good. Thank you. - What's up y'all? - What's up man? Gloria. Jerome. Meet my lady, Shawna. Hey. What's up Shawn? How you doing? Another one? Don't mind her. She just jealous. She always wanted me. Lies you tell. Well Jerome, we were just talking to Todd about his breakup with Janelle. Seeing that you know everything, you got any advice for him? Well, you know, I know everything. He, he look good though. His nose is slightly off a little bit. I can readjust that a little bit. Get you looking a little bit more perpendicular. No, I'm good. I appreciate it. We are all good with all of that, Jerome. Well, I don't wanna stay around here too long. I just came over to say hello. You want some bacon? You know, me and my lady, we got places to go. We got a birthday party, a subway party. We got parties to go to. And a little brunch, you know, in this holiday season. You want some bacon? You want some fruit? You want some pancakes? Look. You bring my plate back. I always bring your plate back, don't I? No, you don't. No, you didn't that last time. Yeah, I love y'all though. Come on. What in the hell? Is that a tumor? Yeah. Listen, man we were hoping that maybe, maybe you'd like to join us for Christmas Eve dinner. I'll be busy. Listen, Marcus. Our neighbor, your Vietnam buddy invited you to park here every Christmas holiday, and we don't know anything about you, man. I was in the middle of something, mister. Can I get back to it? Please? You're a vet. 'Nam, right? - Mhmm. - Oh, whoa. Hey, don't touch that! - That's real? - Of course it's! Oh, wow. Look, I am not comfortable with you being in my home, bro. All right. Yeah. I know it was kind of rude of me just to, to walk in here like that. You gonna have to leave now. All right. All right, well, I hope you reconsider and join us for Christmas Eve dinner. I appreciate the offer, but Sam and I have plans. Okay, okay. Hope you change your mind. - Oh! - Look who made it! Happy holidays! Oh, you made it. Thank you. Thank you. You look so pretty, so grown. When that'd happen? Mama Sylvia. Trina, thank you for making this happen. Yes, 'cause girl, you know Chris was not letting that happen. My boys. So how's business? Ask him. Well, listen, I was thinking about going down to the cabin, huh? Maybe do a little fishing. You talk about it. Yeah, I'm gonna go on. Hey! How y'all doing? Chris. Yo, man, I can't believe you really this upset at me. We're gonna be fine, but you gotta relax. Coming from a partner who forgot he had a partner, right? No, come on man. You ain't gotta be like that, bro. Just give us some time. Promise you man. We gonna win big. But you gotta trust me. Please. Look, Todd, I'm here for Trina and the twins. All right? Brother I ain't got much to say to you. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna need you to keep your distance before I seriously hurt you. But you know what? I'm gonna just excuse myself. Partner. Hey girl. You okay? Hey, no. Can you send me your parents address again? I didn't get it. Oh. I thought I sent it, but yeah. Yeah, sure. Come on over. We're here.

Hey Ken, what's wrong? Like you lost your best friend. I'm cool, Aunt Cyd. So it's about a boy. Look, I'm not that old. I get it. What's his name? Malcolm. Are you guys in love? Mhmm. And I miss him. I didn't think it was gonna be this hard. Well, when's the last time you saw him? Yesterday. But he hasn't called me since then. And then he said he was gonna call me last night, but he didn't. That's not like him. Baby girl he'll call. They always call. Look, don't worry, he's probably traveling. I hope so, auntie. I really love him. Girl you are too young to know about love. Maybe, but I'm old enough to know my life wouldn't be the same without it. That's crazy. Dang! Go get your own chips. Excuse me, bro. Come on man. Let's just talk. It's Christmas. Man, I ain't got nothing to say to you. Can I at least have a minute to explain to you why I did what I did? You did what you did because you're irrational, bro. You lack self esteem. And Janelle has your head all messed up. Hey, keep my wife name out your mouth, all right? Shh! She had nothing to do with my decision. Right. Your decision. Yes. My decision. For us to invest in the state of the art cutting edge domestic service app is gonna make us wealthy. Bro, you don't know that. And you didn't even gimme a chance to research the app, man. Fellas, fellas. You literally spent all of the money we had in our reserve, bro. You do know Trina's at home and the twins are high school seniors, right? Right? Bro, what am I supposed to do if this app is a bust, huh? That app is not gonna bust. I would never take a risk like that if it wasn't worth it. I would never put you in that situation, man. I did this for you. I did it for them. I don't know. I thought you'd be proud or something. And how do you think making this move was a way to prove that, bro? Because man, I did like you always say, I researched and the indicators made it obvious. Bro once this app launched, it's outta here. And we a part of that. I believe in it. Oh, my gosh. Uncle, Todd come here. Come here! What's up? Look. - What's going on? - Oh my god. I didn't, I didn't know. Oh my goodness. Probably think I deserve this. Nobody deserves that. Are you okay, Uncle Todd? Yeah Aunt Janelle is literally all over social media with that hot football player. Twins, don't call Janelle your aunt. She's no longer a part of this family. I'm done. Son. I'll get the door. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hey. I got it. I got it. Thank you so much Dr. Wesley. I hope I'm not intruding. - Ryan! - Not at all. What happened to your trip? It, um... Look no worries. His loss. Let me introduce you to my family. Family. This is my bestie and roomie Ryan Johnson. Hi. Hi. How are you? This is my sister-in-law Trina. My brother Chris. You know my mom. Hi mommy. - You look so pretty. - Thank you. It's really nice to meet you all. Really. Well, welcome to the family, Ryan. Yeah. You'll meet my other son, Todd tomorrow. He, he turned in early. - He wasn't feeling well. - Okay. In fact, Chris, I'm not feeling well either, so I'm gonna go lie down too, okay? Good night. Feel better. Well, let's get you situated. Okay. I'm kinda tired too. Yeah. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't think anybody would be up this late. It's all good. I didn't actually know anybody else would be here either. I just couldn't sleep. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, tell me about it. I'm Todd. Todd Wesley. Hi Todd. What's up? Who are you? That part. I'm Ryan Johnson, Cydney's roommate. Oh yeah. We talked on the phone. - We did. - Okay, yeah. I mean, I didn't know Cydney was bringing anybody for the holidays though. Oh, well she wasn't. I mean, I wasn't gonna come. I had all the plans, but then I realized I had no plans at all. Like no real plans. But you know what? I told myself I wasn't gonna do this. I'm just happy to be here. I'm just happy to be here. Happy to have you. Yeah. Hey, Ken. What's going on? I just checked Malcolm's insta and he's on there all hooked up with another girl. I mean, he's all over this ho, he hasn't even called me. So stupid. Oh, Kennedy, you know what? It's good that you're learning this lesson early because maybe it will help you not get your heart broken in the future. Baby girl. All men are dogs. Wait, what? No, no, no, no. That's not true. All men are not dogs. Your Uncle Todd ain't no dog. Okay? Real men don't cheat. But, women do cheat as well. Sorry? Oh, correction. Correction. Not all women. Okay. So all men cheat, but not all women? Correct. Where they do that at? What are you talking about? That don't sound right to me. I read it in the Bible. Please, keep going. - The Bible? - Yes. What's chapter was that? Second contradictions? This service tonight is really important. It seems like everybody in this family is going through something. Christmas doesn't even feel the same. Yeah, baby. Baby, it will, all right? Now, Reverend Timmons always seems to do the trick. Reverend Timmons hears the word from God. And we'll hear God's word tonight. Amen. And we need it. Yes. Amen. Oh. I got it. I got it. Okay center. All right. Center. Hey Gina, can you speak now? Listen, I am so sorry for all the sneaking around, but I really need to see you. Don't call me back and don't leave a message. She might check my phone. I'll call you when I can. Please. Bye. Y'all. And then dad was like, I need to keep it a secret. But I don't understand why. Like, what's the secret, dad? I mean, really. I just, I'm trying to be nosy. I love mornings like this during the Christmas holiday. They're just so special. Don't you agree, Mom? Oh, I do. And I have a big surprise for you tonight at the Christmas celebration at church. Good morning ladies. Morning. And cheers to you all. Cheers. What are you drinking, Glo? Just a little Christmas celebration. A libation, whatever you want to call it. Uncle Todd! No, no, no, no, man. I'm already headed out as it is. Oh, well you look quite dapper, brother. Where are you going? Oh, I'm headed up the street to mind your business, Cydney. You are gonna be back in time for the Christmas celebration tonight at the church? Yes ma'am. I'm already dressed and I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Okay. - Okay. Love you. Love you too. Auntie Glo. Are you coming to the church service this evening? Oh, ooh, honey. The only church folks I deal with is you Wesley's. Them folks to judgy for me. If they don't want folks smoking in the church bathroom, they need to put a sign up. Lord. But don't you worry, I'll be here. Come on, Syl, We know how we used to! You already got your disco outfit on. The after party. Taryn, we could have totally ditched this for the mall. I need to find some cute boys to put my story. Ken, why are you being so petty? It doesn't have to be tat for tat with Malcolm. Yeah, but it'll make me feel better if he thinks I'm not thinking about him. Fine tomorrow, then? All right, hallelujah! My God, my God! Let the church sing out your name. Now I want you this Christmas to spread some love. Remind somebody they matter. Do a kind gesture. It's giving time this season to give to others. It'll go a long way. So without further ado, will you rise to your feet, put your hands together and welcome our own sister Cydney who came all the way down here for Christmas form New York, My God, to give us a musical selection. Let the Lord you use you.

I think I'm gonna do something nice for him tomorrow. Ken, you wanna help me? It might make you feel better. I feel like a fool for liking Malcolm. You're not a fool. Okay? He is. How about this? Let's take another, "I'm living in my best life" selfie for Instagram, okay? Don't ever let him see you cry. Here let's do a selfie. Aww. Look at them, Chris. Our girls. It's nothing like the love and bond between sisters, right? Especially roommates. You and your brother are a real blessing to each other too. Babe. He made a huge mistake by not including you. He did. But he is still your brother. And he really needs you. Who's ready for Christmas cocktails? We are! Where am I at? I want y'all to meet my after church boo. Shamika. Oh baby. Did Jerome do that to you? Yeah. Hey! Oh! Hi Todd, I'm sorry. You got me again. Actually, you got me this time. Do you wanna sit down? You alright? Yeah. I'm just up checking my phone like a fool. Everything okay? It's my boyfriend, oh, ex-boyfriend. Like I found out that he is married with two kids. And here I am just waiting around for him to call with an apology. I just, I feel like a fool. Who does that? Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I heard about your wife. Or your ex. You know what? She should be ashamed of herself. It's all good. I mean, in retrospect, it's kind of my fault. I mean, I know who I was marrying before I even married her. Should have known it wasn't gonna last. To think, you know, Cydney warned me about my ex. Word? Yes. She warned me about Janelle too. She did? Oh my goodness. Yeah, I hate when she's right. You know what? I'm done with being sorry. Hold that thought. Hold that thought. Okay. This is what we going to do. Oh, for sure. I'm always with that. That's for you. That's mine. Here is to us getting what we deserve. Cheers? Cheers. Oh. Phew. Wasn't expecting that. That was rough. You know, we really do deserve better. We do, but we deserve it without the BS. Like I don't want it. Exactly. - I don't want it. - I'm gonna drink to that. Ooh, that's a nice pour. You pretty cool. This one's gonna be for you. To us. To us. What about five? I got five. You're so stupid. You are something. Oh. Good morning. Morning. So, last night. Did, did we do the- - What? No, no. It wasn't nothing like that. I mean, I mean, we drank a lot, man. Because you can't hold your liquor. We came upstairs because you was gonna wake up the whole house. Me, wake everybody up by myself? I don't think so. You can't remember, you was drunk. It's true. You know, I, I don't, I don't do this. This is, this is not like me. I would never do anything like this because this is so out of- - No Ryan. Chill. You don't have to explain that to me. Listen, I think you're incredible. And last night was, it was a lot of fun. I needed that. But you know, I just... not like that. I respect you too much.

Can we speak, please? Alone? I don't have nothing to say to you. Please. You don't wanna have this conversation in front of our whole family. His whole family. And you know what? You got a lot of nerve coming here, Janelle. Cydney, I know you may feel some kind of way about me, but this is none of your business. What? You came to our house, which makes it my business. And you know what? I always thought you were acting. Cyd, I got it. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay, okay. Somebody's gonna have to get her. Son, please. Trying to have family breakfast. I got it. Let's go. Todd, I messed up. Okay? I realized I made a hasty decision, but I'm ready to come home. Okay look, I know by now you know that Cam and I- - The whole world know what you been up to. I know, I know. I made a lifestyle change. But who could blame me? Really, Todd he offered me everything you couldn't. I mean the fancy mansion and the cars and the staff. I mean, he paraded me around in designer bags and clothes and jewelry. Yo, Janelle, ain't nobody trying to hear this. What's your point? I know. My point is, I had it all. So I thought. It sound like you was living a dream. I really was. That is, until he told me he wanted to share everything with me. Ain't that what you wanted? I did, but everything meant his other women too. You serious? That's why you here. Cause yo cheater cheated. No, I'm here because I realized I was in love, but it wasn't with him. I miss my husband. My Hottie Toddy. And I want us to get back together. Okay even, even if it means we have to struggle for a little while longer. I miss us. - You can't be- - Shh. Don't answer yet, okay? I realize this is a lot to take in. So I booked a room at the W. I'll go freshen up. I'll pick up a few Christmas gifts. I know I have a lot of work to do to get back in with your family, especially with Cydney. - Janelle, that's not even- - Shh. Don't talk yet. We can fix this. Bye babes. Yo, Dennis. What's going on, man? Happy holidays. How are you living? Good. Hey, look, we gotta talk. You got a minute? So are you ready to make Mr. Elkins our good deed project for Christmas? - I don't know. - Come on. He looks like he can use some kindness. And a makeover. Remember Pastor Timson about helping people? You should help him. Plus you need to get your mind off of Malcolm. This is the perfect distraction. I don't feel like it, Taryn. Let's go, Ken. You owe me one. And it's Christmas. We made vows, Regina. Through sickness and health, Marcus. It's not crazy. Look, look. But it's Christmas Eve. Come on, Just talk to me about this. You went to war my husband, and came back a stranger, Marcus. Look. I know and I'm sorry I can't do this anymore. You need to get yourself together. Or you'll always be alone. Come on Regina, please. You can't leave right now, Regina. Come on Regina. I love you babe. Marcus. Goodbye. I can't do this anymore. You'll always be alone. You'll always be alone. You'll always be alone. Oh, shit. What do you want? Ugh. We wanna invite you for Christmas Eve dinner. I'm not interested. How do you know? You've never been. I'm fine here. Mr. Marcus, how can you be fine here? Your place isn't mess and I don't smell anything cooking. Yeah. We have a delicious dinner plan. Okay, we got Turkey, ham, sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, pies, cake. What happened here? Oh. I just had a little spill. So, so dinner, huh? Okay, that sounds good. But I don't have nothing to wear. We got you on that. Thank you brother. No problem. You know I got you. Couldn't do without you. I think that covers everything. Lets see. Where's your brother? I can bring him up on the app data if you want me to. I think he's here. Let me go try to find him. I'll be right here. Hey, thank you man. Thanks again. No problem. I got you, man. Todd, where are your headphones? I need to use them. Oh. Hi. I'm so sorry. I thought Todd was in here. Who are you? I'm Dennis. Todd's attorney. And you are? Oh, I'm Cydney, Todd's sister. I didn't realize that Todd had a sister. I was only aware of his brother, Chris. Well, he does. And we're not in business together. I live in New York. Really? New York, huh. Are you here for the holidays with your husband? Please. I'm not married. Excuse me. You're excused. Nice to meet you Dennis. Happy holidays. Happy holidays. Cydney. Hey, what's up Ryan? Hey. What's up? I haven't seen you all day. Yeah, I've been in the kitchen baking. You good? No, no, I'm not. Janelle. She's trying to like put the marriage and stuff back together. Wow. Whew. You've really been going through it, huh? You know what? A good friend would tell you that you just, you need to take some time to think about what it is you want and need in a relationship. And a good friend would also tell you that you are a smart man and only you know what's best for you. So just be careful. Okay? I appreciate you, Ryan. Thanks. Good friend. Come here. Yo, Chris. Happy you here man. Hey, Dennis is upstairs and let's talk about the acquisition. You got a couple minutes? I really ain't got time for this bro. Can you please just come upstairs real quick? It's not gonna take long at all. And it's important you know what's going with the app. You just don't get it, do you? Oh, Chris, can you, can you please just come upstairs? Can you spare me a couple of minutes? Dennis is on the clock. You got one minute. Meet my brother, Chris. Chris, nice to finally meet you, bro. Heard great things about you. Well, unfortunately I can't say the same thing about you, Dennis, because I'm sure, as you know, my brother just let me know about this investment. Nope. Actually, Chris, he didn't know that. My apologies, Dennis. Can you excuse us for a second? Chris, I realize now more than ever that I should have included you in the decision. And for that, I'm sorry. But I've said sorry almost a thousand times already. Have you ever thought that maybe this was your fault? - My fault? - Yeah, your fault. Man you must be sipping, sniffing, smoking, uncles' egg nog. What are you talking about? I'm talking about everything man. You always trying to take the lead. You don't never let me make no decisions. I can't even talk. It's like you want me to stay in your damn shadow. You know what? I'm not trying to do this right now. Oh, you don't say? Chris don't give a damn about what Todd got to say. You know, it's been like that since we was kids. Every time I would try something, you would try it. And then what would happen? You'd do 10 times better every single time. In high school, it was sports. In college, it was grades. And what's your point? And my point is now in adulthood its everything else, man. You got the perfect life, man. You got it all. You got a beautiful wife, you got perfect kids. And what I got? I got Janelle. Look, I've always just been the little brother, but you've always been the big brother that has no problem letting the little brother know how much better you are as if I didn't already notice. You're my baby brother. Bro I had no idea you even felt that. Why wouldn't you say anything? What you want me to say, that I'm jealous? That I feel like I don't measure up? Is that what you want to hear? Huh? I'm a prove to you and everybody else in this world that I'm great too. - Yeah, you're great. - Yeah, I'm great. And that's why you took all of our savings and spent it to prove to the whole world that you're great, right? No, that's not what happened. I invested it. Yo, Dennis, can you please? I can't- No, no, no. I don't need no explanation. Matter of fact, you're an attorney, right? Yes I am. I'm gonna need you to prepare the papers to have my brother buy me outta this company. Now. You not making no sense. Can you stop being ridiculous? Come on man. We too deep in it for that. Look man, the app is already getting amazing reviews. Just give it a chance. Yeah it's actually the only app of is kind where people can find a service provider to fix their issues at home. Same day they find out that cost of how much it's gonna be. It's a cutting edge, Chris, I'm saving a chance, man. Look, Chris, I already told you we was gonna win big, and I meant it. But now I'm begging you. Please hang in there with me a little bit longer. Would you just trust me for once? Okay. I mean we're in it, right? Thank you Dennis. My pleasure. Todd, if you really believe in this, Yes I do. I believe in you. You got it. You got it. Thank you. Appreciate you. Hey, if we could shift gears here for a minute. What's good? Can we address your gorgeous sister, Cydney? Cydney? Yeah. Hey, hey, look bro. Listen to me. You don't want them kind of problems. You should just let Cydney go. Trust me. Why, why, why not? My man, you can't handle Cydney. I don't know how to tell you. I don't really think anybody can to be honest with you. Just let it go. Trust me. Todd. All right, you serious. Y'all, I still cannot believe that hooker had the nerve to come back here and expect Todd to forgive her. I know, right? After we saw her prancing around social media like some football groupie. Ladies, I am pleased to report that Malcolm is not a dog. And the girl in the picture is not a ho. She's his cousin. Did she say ho? - Who's Malcolm? - Huh? They've been video chatting all day. Yeah, we're back in love. Careful using that I word, Ken. Especially when you ain't talked to mommy yet. Who is Malcolm? I did tell you! So I'm coming in with the fellas and guess who I ran into? Jeff. Jeff? What are you doing here? I got the address that you sent me last week. And I wanted to surprise you, baby. Cydney, you do have a boyfriend. Look at her face. How you doing Miss Wesley? Call me Mom. Mom, fam. This is my friend Jefferson. I thought I'd come down and surprise my girl. Jeff is my friend from New York, and there must have been some sort of mix up. See, I didn't mean to send that address to you. I thought I was sending it to Ryan. I'm so sorry. No worries. Obviously your heart wanted me here. This could be a special time for us, baby. And on that note. Good luck, bro. Well since you here, how about a drink? Now that sounds lovely. I know my way around the kitchen too. Let me help out. Okay, well go wash your hands and come on. - Yes ma'am. - You hungry? - Yes ma'am. - I'll fix you something. Thank you. Get the clean sheets for the guest room. - Mama. - What? He may not be staying. Wait girl. Girl, girl girl. What is your boy doing here? Ryan, the text that I meant to send to you with the address, I sent to Jefferson. - Guess what happened? - What? Love found a way. I don't wanna be bothered with him. By the looks of it, Aunt Glo pretty much has him tied up, okay? So how about we just go back in the kitchen and finish what we started? - I can't. - Why? I need a minute. You know, you go ahead and get him some clean sheets and I, you know, Uncle Jerome just got here. I'm a hangout out with him. Okay. I'll get him some clean sheets and put it in the room beside you, darling. 'Cause your mama said so. It's not that I'm trying to be difficult, I just know what I want. You just like your Uncle Jerome. I can't be tied down either. All these women out here just waiting to love on me. We can't be monogamous. Two players for life. Yeah. You better go ahead with your bad self. See Jerome? I told you not to mess with my baby. Oh yes. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you very much. This looks good. Like I was saying, I went over there to invite him for a Christmas Eve dinner and I saw his meds. Whose meds. Elkins. Are we still talking about that old fool? Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, he's taking Zoloft and Prozac. Wait a minute. Sam used to take that stuff. Yeah. Well it it's a common medicine to help fight PTSD. Well that still doesn't excuse him for being the petty ass. I'm gonna step out just for a second. Glo, you can go ahead and take my drink. I know you want it. Well hopefully you ain't got the cooties. Watch your mouth. Whatever. And your problem would be? What? What is wrong with you? Nothing. You know I can see it all in your face. Did you see that? There's something going on with Bryan. He's been so secretive. I mean, he goes into the bathroom at night with his phone. He doesn't let me look at the text messages. And why all of a sudden he needs a passcode for his cell phone? He's hiding something. I can feel it in my gut. So you think he's having an affair? What else could it be? Girl, don't nobody want your husband. Y'all been married for what, 34 years? 35 in January. Who throws away 35 years of marriage? Don't nobody want you or him. I'm just kidding. But still, I know Bryan. He ain't crazy. He loves you. Well I hope so. Come on, let's toast it in. I'm gonna need four more of these if it's true. Hey, what's up Jay? Hello. How about we just go talk in the den real quick? Oh, Todd, later. I brought some gifts for the fan. I know I have some making up to do, especially with that Cydney. You know what I was thinking? Maybe I could give her a makeover. Hey, you know what? Actually that's not gonna be all that necessary. Jay. Look, I can't do this anymore. So now I want a divorce. Okay. Okay, Todd, I get it. You're trying to even the playing field and make me feel some kind of way because I left you, right. Okay, cool. Go ahead. Have your moment. But you can stop now, I'm done playing games anymore. No Janelle. I'm not playing. I never was. This isn't it, Jay. I can't do it anymore. Todd. I said I'm sorry. What else do you want me to say? I mean, I came here to try to work it out. Listen. Look, for the first time in a very, very long time, I get it. I'm never gonna be what you want. You know, I'm being honest. You've never been what I need, Jay. I deserve love too. I need somebody who's gonna support me, be there for me, believe in me, love me. Grow with me forever. And Jay, we've never ever had that connection, ever. So I'm sorry. We just done. Baby, you don't mean that. I already had my attorney draw up separation documents. You're really leaving me. You know what? That's okay. You never deserve med anyway. That's right Janelle. I ain't deserve none of this. Yeah, exactly. Look at me. I will always secure my bag, Todd. Okay? Merry Christmas Todd. Merry Christmas to you and your family. Merry Christmas to you and yo dusty- - So long, Janelle. So how does it look on you? That sounds nice. So when can we get together? You know I need it. Okay. Okay. Listen, I'll figure out a way to get outta the house to see you. Okay. All right. Goodbye. Who is it? It's Ken and Taryn. Oh, look, look, look. You all go back home, now, all right? I've changed my mind. No, Mr. Marcus. We said we'll be back today. I know, but I'm not going anywhere so I don't need the makeover. You do need the makeover. Who's that? I don't think you should park there. I wouldn't park there if far were you. What was that? Young man. Young man, look here. You can't park here. You blocking my driveway. All right. Alright. You gotta move your car. My bad. I didn't see it. I'm about to move it right now. You ladies are relentless. We know. Oh, I want it. I want it. Look, I grew up playing back here. It's so cute. Hey, what's up ladies? Dennis, you've already met my sister Cydney. This is her lovely roommate, Ryan. And this is our Auntie Glo. This is my attorney Dennis Dobson. Nice to meet you ladies. Well, do you do prepaid legal or something like that? No ma'am. But I can help if need it. Here you go Cyd, you left your phone. What's up, Chris? Well, dinner won't be ready until later. But how about a cocktail, handsome? Oh. Actually we have plans. We have the next few hours off, so we're going to lunch at the wharf. Oh, the wharf. I love the wharf. - I've never been. - Never been? Y'all should come. - We should go. - We should go. Okay well, while y'all are gone, I'm gonna get dressed for dinner tonight and I'll just see y'all later. Okay. It's nice to meet you Aunt Glo. Good to meet you too. We should get dressed too. Yes, let's go. Sounds good. Let's roll. Hey baby. Where we going? Hi. What's wrong? I saw him. You saw what? He was with someone else. How do you know? I followed him and he went into this woman's house. She was a cutie though, right? Yeah. You know how they are. - You all right Todd? - Doing good, man. What you got for me? Oh yeah. This right here, my brother, is for you. Wanted you to have the most recent updates about your app deal. Dude, this can't be real. Nah, it's definitely real. We gotta find a way to tell Chris. Yeah, I know. He's certainly gonna feel away about this. You know what? Let's not talk about this right now. It's too close to Christmas, but, all right. Whatever you say. Yeah. All right, cool. How's your day going, Ryan? You good? Oh, it's been fantastic today. Just been chilling, you know, putting the final touches on Christmas Eve dinner. Just relaxing. That's what's up. Well look, I don't know if y'all down, but wanna play some cards? Ooh. How about teams? Girls against guys. Hey, that sounds good to me. Teams. Don't you think it's a little uneven right now? Hey, how you doing man? Dennis Dobson. Jefferson Clark. I'm Cydney's- - My friend. Jeff is my friend from New York. Oh, okay. Well I'm gonna get a refill on this drink. Cyd? I'm good Jeff. Oh, so it's like that? That's exactly what it's like. You're a real ball buster, huh? No idea. Zero clue, Like. That's not fair. I'm just protective of what's mine. And I'm not willing to settle for anything less. Well, that's the way it's supposed to be, right? Is he your man? Jefferson? No, I don't have a man. I mean, I bring a lot to the table, and I'm not interested in compromising my standards. Well that makes sense. But in relationships there has to be some compromise, right? Well yeah, but I'm not gonna have someone just come into my world to get close to me and break my heart. Well understand that. But a real man would never do that to you. Not if he sees what he has. So do you know what you doing? Nope. But I am gonna be a celebrity stylist one day. You'll be fine. I got you. So we'll give you a cut and then you can take a shower. Okay? I already bathed. When? Recently. When is recently? Oh, the 17th. - Oh God. - What? At least he didn't say since the war. Oh, you got jokes, huh? I can get down now. Was middle school- - Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. You know what, Cyd? Maybe I should leave. Yeah? You could at least try to hide it. I'm sorry, Jeffrey. Look, I tried to tell you back in New York, you're a really great guy. Look look look. I don't hate all of that. You need to realize what you want in life. Cause I'm a catch. And if you're not careful, you're gonna end up an old man. You know, I actually feel sorry for you. Or maybe I should feel sorry for him. Hey. Are you okay? I think we should chill. Dealing with me leads to nowhere. I don't think I'm looking for something serious right now. Well, maybe something serious is looking for you. Hey baby. Where have you been? Oh, I was out getting some fresh egg nog for dinner. Really? Yeah. Can you believe everybody is sold out? I don't believe much these days. Well, hello girls. Ooh, who do we have here? I thought I knew all the handsome men in town of a certain age. Who is this? Auntie Glo, it's Mr. Elkins, our neighbor. Elkins next door? Marcus? The grinch? See children, I told you this is not a good idea. I'm gonna go. No, you are not leaving. Auntie Glo. Okay. I was just kidding. Well, you clean up very well. For a Grinch. For a Grinch. Well, alright then. Well, let's go get you a margarita. Sylvia. Stop, stop. What is the problem? I had no idea Marcus was so fine. Girl, what a little soap and water can do for a brother. But how do I navigate this? I've been so mean to him. Well, you might try apologizing. But knowing you, that's not gonna happen. I know how to apologize, Bryan. I've just never been wrong, so I never had to. You ain't never wrong. You got something to say? I ain't say nothing. Listen, Glo. I need to speak to Sylvia. Where were you this afternoon? Well, I told you I went to find some egg nog. - That's a lie. - What? - I saw you. - You saw me where? With her. Really? I thought we were so happy. Wait a minute. Sylvia, you followed me? What does that have to do with anything? Look, we'll talk about this tomorrow. Oh. Go ahead and run 'cause you got caught. Do you really think he's cheating Syl? Yes. I saw him. I cannot believe this is happening after 35 years. Well, let's deal with this later. Put a smile on your face for your family. - I can't pretend. - Yes you can. Let's deal with this in the morning after we open up the gifts, okay? Your family really needs you right now. Okay? Okay. All right. Come on. I got your Grinch. Oh, well that's something I hadn't seen on you. What? It's almost as good as that suit you have on. You should smile more. Yeah well, there's not a whole lot to smile about these days. Well, tell me about the time you were in the military. Cause you know, I was a military wife. Really? Well I was in from 73 to 75. Yeah? Sam was there in 74. Yeah. He just wasn't the same when he came home. But you stuck with him, right? I mean, I mean, you stayed with him even though he came back different. Of course he was different. But he was still my Sam. And I stayed there with him all the way to the end. Well, I'm sorry for your loss. Yeah, it's okay. It seems like the only thing I remember are our classic arguments. Yeah. Well, I'm sure he didn't win many of those. Anytime I would start a sentence with his full name, he knew all hell was gonna break loose. I would say, "Sam Anthony Corbett." "You hadn't emptied this damn trash in two days." Boy. He was lazy. For a military guy, he just wasn't that disciplined. You said your husband's name was Sam Corbett? Yeah. First Sergeant Sam A Corbett, of the fourth Infantry division. I mean, you knew him? I fought right alongside him. He was our platoon leader. Oh my God. I can't tell you how many times that man saved our lives. The last time I remember him was, there was this huge explosion. You were there? Yeah. Yeah. I was, I was right beside him. It came outta nowhere. And I tried to protect, I wanted to protect him. I tried, after the explosion, I pulled him, I pulled him out of the fire. But I thought he had died. And then almost immediately after another bomb exploded and we had to take cover and I- I didn't want to leave him. I didn't wanna leave him. I've carried that guilt. Ever since that day. It was really bad and he's never been the same. But he credited some guy named Big E for saving his life. That was me. That was me. - That was you? - Yeah. So you brought him home to me? You saved him? You know, we had a good life for the most part. But the depression just took over and he just never, I mean, just one day he just took his life. I'm so sorry. You know, back then depression was taboo in the community. And I just wish I knew more about it. Maybe Sam would be here with me today. I thought about going to see somebody once, but I, I don't know. I have seen so much. Done so much. I lost so much. I think it'll be worth it. I dunno. Come on. I mean, we need you. Who else is gonna keep us in check? Can I call you the old grinch? Time for dinner, guys. Sammy. Sam, come here boy. Come here. What mean, what, what is, what is his name? It's Sam. Yeah, I did, I did. Come here, Sam. ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ Strike the harp and join the chorus ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ Follow me in merry measure ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ While I tell of Yuletide treasure ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la Merry Christmas sweetheart.
