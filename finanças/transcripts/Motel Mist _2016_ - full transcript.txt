I won’t take it, I won’t take it, I won’t take it. Some thief sneaked in while I was sleeping. When I opened my eyes I was shocked. The thief sneaked in and touched me, kissed me, embraced me. I won’t take it, I won’t take it. I grabbed a gun. I stood up hoping to shoot him dead. But just as I was about the pull the trigger the thief rushed in and embraced me, kissed me loudly, then jumped out the back window. Officer, I want to report a crime. At about 2 a.m. on the 13th, a thief—I don’t know his name burly and dark skinned, sneaked in while I was sleeping and touched me, kissed me, then ran away. I won’t take it, I won’t take it, so I’m here to report a crime. You have to catch him, officer. Put him behind bars, he deserves it. Then let him kiss me again and I won’t press charges. I won’t take it, I won’t take it, so I’m here to report a crime. You have to catch him, officer. Put him behind bars, he deserves it. Then let him kiss me again and I won’t press charges. Tul Triparp’s mother, Nid, is here with us now. Since Nid came out with the announcement of her son’s disappearance yesterday her story has made all the headlines and continues to grasp the attention of the public. Tul Triparb, of course, is a former child star who was once immensely popular. According to Nid, Tul has disappeared from home for almost two weeks. Nid believes the disappearance to be her son’s own action, not an abduction, no foul play involved. Mental conditions may be the cause of this incident. Nid thinks that her son may be delusional. All of this may come as a surprise to fans who never noticed anything unusual in Tul’s behavior. Most thought that Tul decided to leave show business in order to focus on his studies. There was no sign that he was delusional, believing that he was an alien. That was what Nid informed the public in her announcement. Do I understand correctly, Nid, that Tul thinks he is an alien from outer space. Let’s just say Tul believes that aliens are communicating with him. I’m not certain whether he believes himself to be an alien or not. He only said aliens were communicating with him, told him they would come to take him away, something like that. Well, no one can possibly know whether he thinks he’s an alien or not, but we know, from your report, that Tul thinks he’s communicating with aliens and that they are coming to take him away. Are you saying that Tul has now gone away with the aliens? Just like I said in the announcement, Tul’s is not healthy. He is in a bad condition. He may think he’s gone with the aliens, but in reality he is ill. So, what you’re trying to say is that Tul’s mental condition is the only thing responsible for his disappearance, am I right? There is probably no one else involved, I’m sure of that. Now I am only concerned about my son. Actually, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. But I don’t know what to do. The authorities still can’t locate him. Apart from mental illness, do you think there may be other factors that caused this? Some news reports have speculated the issue of drug use... I already told you he is sick. Very sick. All right. If Tul happens to be watching this interview, is there anything you would like to say to him? Tul. If you are watching, if you can hear me, please come home. I’m waiting for you. I have only you. I’m extremely concerned. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. Please come home, Tul I beg you. We wish to express our support. And if you, the viewers, come across any information about Tul, you can contact our program. We will help to get the information to Nid. And now let’s watch clips of interviews with Tul’s friends, sending messages to Tul, in case he is watching. Tul Triparp’s disappearance is all over the news all day today. They say he’s crazy, delusional, seeing aliens, something like that. Who? Oh, that’s right. You’re too young to know Tul Triparb. Once he was super famous. Became a star at a very young age. Acting in movies, TV dramas, had music albums, was in commercials, everything. He was everywhere. Hard to believe Hard to believe he would grow up to be delusional. Come to think of it, I feel bad for these child stars. If they don’t become drug addicts, they turn crazy and see aliens. Hey, what’s up? Does it have to be like that? Just tell her to chill. Oh, yeah? She didn’t say it like that in the text she sent me. That’s not cool, no? Really? You really wanna do that? Come on. What the hell? You fucking bitch! It’s not right for children to swear! No, babe, I didn’t go to see anybody. Honestly, there was no one. I went out to buy some stuff. I left it in the room so I couldn’t answer. I really went to buy stuff. A lot of stuff. Different stuff. Oh, yes, I also bought some rope. Rope. Yes, rope. I can use it tie your heart to mine, you know? Wait a sec. I have to get back to work, babe. Really, I have to work. Everything ready? The camera’s battery should be fully charged by now, sir. Arrived. Hello, brother. You want a room? But we don’t have any girls now. Just the room. Room five. I can’t give you room five How about one from eleven to fifteen? Any one of those is available. Room five. I really can’t give room five to you, bro. All the rooms are equally good. Room five. If you drive on about a kilo you’ll see another motel called Happy Gigs. They may be able to give you their number five. Room five. Well, you got it, bro. All right. This way. You can have room four too, if you want. Come on, help me do some work. Sit over there. Don’t let my glass fall off. Quit playing with your smartphone. Time to play with me now. Stretch your arms forward. Like you’re going to fly. Good. Turn over. Slowly. Stretch your arms like before. Good. Be very still. There’s whiskey in my glass, so don’t spill it. I’ll really be angry if you do. You’ve spilled it! Look. What a waste. I forgive you this time. Go take a shower. Wash every part nice and clean. And don’t take too long I’m ready to play. Today we’re at the house of former child star Tul Triparp who has mysteriously disappeared. According to Tul’s mother, Nid, Tul’s mental condition is most likely the sole cause of this incident. We are here to talk to Nid and to explore this sensational story further. This is Tul’s bedroom. Tul has been writing in these notebooks for quite some time. If you start to read, you’ll realize they’re all conversations. Two sides writing back and fourth but Tul is the only writer. Look carefully and you’ll see that the handwritings are also different. This is Tul’s handwriting. But this is the handwriting of someone or something else that Tul is communicating with. There are hundreds of notebooks like this. You mean these notebooks are conversations between Tul and the aliens? I think Tul believes so. But it was only him who wrote these words. Do you think there’s a connection between these writings and Tul’s disappearance? I have no idea. Since Tul started to write in these notebooks he almost never spoke to me again. He only communicated with himself or with something he thought was sending him messages. He was always preoccupied with that something He listened to everything it told him to do. Ready. Prepare the space. Hello. What you up to, babe? What? Come again? It’s bitter and expensive. I don’t like it. I like Thai coffee, with condensed milk. Sweet. Sweet. I like it sweet. Cause I’m a sweet guy, you know. Hey, babe, listen. I wanna see you again. Can you come out to see me? Why not? Please come out to see me. Please, please, please, pretty please. Come to see me. In an hour, please? Please. Sick. I’m sick. It’s all right, I’m just sick of missing you. OK, just please consider coming out to see me. Take pity on me, please. I gotta go back to work. OK. Muah, muah, muah. Hello. My name is Tot, last name Niyom. Nicknamed Tot but friends call me Tong. Currently I work at a love motel. Everyday I work there. Sometimes I have the weekend off. My main duty is to welcome the guests and take care of stuff in the rooms. Oh, the place is called Motel Mistress. But my dream job is fire performer on the beach. Yes, that’s right. The reason that makes me want to be a fire performer is because when I was young I had a friend who lived in a beach resort town and he took me to see a fire performance and I thought it was so cool. I loved it. Kids like things that look powerful, you know. It’s like playing with lightsabers in Star Wars. Loved it. And they say you can make a lot of cash and get a lot of chicks doing it. They say everyday there’s a new chick offering herself to the fire performer. That’s why I want to do it. Ah, was that not politically correct? I just want to be a fire performer because of the money and you get to hang by the sea. Yes. Not good. I think less is more. I’m in a minimalist mood today. Go put your clothes back on. I want to sniff the scent of your sweat. Hold on a minute. Why the rush to lay down? Come sit around with me first. Keep still. Wait. Open your mouth. I said open your mouth. Open it! Don’t be difficult. Keep still. It won’t take long. Just keep still. That’s it, see? Be a good girl and don’t make things difficult, OK? Give me your hand. What? What are you saying? Speak clearly. I can’t hear it. You want to speak so badly? Wait, wait, wait. All right. What did you say? I think this movie is boring. Can’t we change it? You pay attention to my movie? Ever since I started using this room, you’re the first to have something to say about the movies I put on. I’m the nostalgic type. I like watching movies from the older eras, before everything became digital. Images these days are so sharp there’s no soul left in them. No longer sensitive and natural. What problem do you have with this movie? Tell me. The guy’s ugly. I can’t stand it. I guess it’s true what they say. Kids these days have no patience. Pay attention only to the superficials. But I like that you’re not afraid to express yourself. If you wish to change the movie, I’ll let you chose one you prefer. Go and pick a movie yourself. All right? What are you looking around there for? Come and get it here. Come. I don’t believe anyone else is involved in Tul’s disappearance. I believe that Tul left the house on his own. And Tul is a very sick person, he may be harmful to himself. I have been in close contact with the authorities and they are doing their best to find Tul. But I would like to announce that whoever can provide information or lead me or the authorities to Tul’s whereabout, that person will receive one hundred thousand baht as a reward for the information. Damn. And two hundred thousand baht One hundred thousand? if the information leads us to Tul. Such firm flesh. Your young girl scent makes me feel very alive. Be still! Don’t you want to do two girls at the same like in the movie? You think I’ve never done that? I’ve done even five at the same time. I have a friend, very pretty. She needs cash, wants to join us. Waste of time. Also, you don’t have to worry that we won’t have fun. I guarantee that I will give you the time of your life. There’s plenty of pretty young girls who need cash. But, won’t you give it a try? My friend is very beautiful. You won’t regret it, I promise. Big breasts too. How soon can your friend get here? She’s actually not far from here. Should be able to get here in less than ten minutes if you want her. Let me make it clear. If I don’t like what I see I will send her away. I need to use my phone. Call her. I’ll talk. Hello. What’s your name? Vicky? Your friend says you want to come and join the fun? But how do you know where your friend is? That so? if you can really show up here in five, come. But if later than that, don’t even think about it. If you don’t listen to what I say, both of you will be in big trouble. Your friend’s name is Vicky, correct? She told me you asked her to follow us since we left the school. Is that true? I’m sorry. What? My hearing’s not so good. I’m sorry. Remember, I don’t like having people sneaking around behind my back. Understand? Don’t think that just because I’m nice to you you can do whatever you please. If I don’t like what I see when your friend shows up, you’re gonna be sorry. I am not a mean person. But people must have principles, have manners, be considerate to your seniors. If everyone did whatever he or she wanted, how could we function as a society? A girl is coming. Take care of it. You’re very lucky, Vicky. Come in and join the fun. Come inside. Make yourself comfortable. You’re not going to just sit there and watch, right? There is an appropriate soundtrack for every atmosphere, girls. Wait a sec. What took you so long? You’re always late. And for every action there is an appropriate outfit. I appreciate simplicity. Slow life. We have all night together. There is no need to rush. Lovely. Marvelous. Fantastic. You girls are quick. Very efficient. I like it. But untie me first. I haven’t selected the toys to use with you girls yet. Ouch! That hurts! You don’t have to worry. We will select the toys ourselves. Wait for command. What? Say again? Say it louder. What the fuck do you think you’re doing? A good grown up doesn’t swear. You fucking bitch! Are you deaf? Do I have to repeat myself? Let me go. Fucking asshole. I’ve done it. Now what should we do with him? - It took you so long to show up. - You’re such a cry baby. It’s all right now. I’m the superhero type, don’t you think? Shows up to rescue the girl just in time. Look at the asshole. If I took your role everything would have collapsed before it even began for sure. I detest his fucking face. But you, you were perfect for the part. Weak, weepy, wimpy. I’ll give you an Oscar, OK? But I was scared. No need to be scared anymore! Let’s take a selfie. - Are you nuts? - We’ll send it to Pim. Wipe off your tears and smile. Come on. Quick. Be Pretty. Come on. You don’t have to smile, asshole Hurry up! I don’t know what face to make. Wait a sec. Have to look pretty first. Here we go. You recognize this face? She’s my friend. This friend of mine is now a fucking vegetable because of you. Asshole. Since you enjoyed playing with our friend so much, we wanted to play with you too. Now what should we do? Just fuck with the asshole. What else? There’s no need to be creative about it. I know. But how? Just squeeze his fucking balls. Nah! What if they burst in my hand? That’ll be fucking painful enough already. What do you wanna do? Do whatever you want. Bite his fucking dick off? He might even enjoy it, fucking pervert. Look at his fucking face. Listen. You think about it then. I’m thirsty. And I’m exhausted. Any drinking water in this place? There’s liquor in the other room. No kidding! Come on. Let’s go. Come on. What’re you waiting for? Hurry! Hey, bro. Brother. I’ve got clean towels for you. What the hell? Hey. Yeah? Did you feel something? When? When we kissed. Feel what? Like, feeling good? A good feeling? You kidding? I think...I felt it. Are you drunk? I think when I kissed you I was aroused. Why so serious? Are you all right? You know that my brother’s a fag, right? Yeah? And? You think it’s genetic? Why? Your folks gay? Dunno. Never asked them. Maybe they are. Nonsense. No. I mean, I wanna know. I mean, it’s no big deal, right? I always make fun of my brother but it’s only because everybody makes fun of him. Fact that he likes men or fucks men, I don’t think is so strange. What’s the difference, If people feel that’s what they want? Maybe I like girls. Don’t tell me you’re in love with me. I’ll slap your face! Don’t be so serious. Anything wrong? Nothing. I’m just curious. I think I was aroused when we kissed. I’m a very pretty girl, so of course. Right. Bitch! Have you done this online test? How Good A Citizen Are You? No. Why? Take the test. I’ll share it to you. I got an eighty-four percent score on it! Did you cheat? There’s no way you scored eighty-four. Watch your mouth. I’m really a good citizen, that’s why. Thing is, the questions are damn easy. If you know the right thing to say, everyone can get a high score. Which country is the test for? What do you mean? Good citizen for which country? Which society? What do you mean? Society is society. It’s not all the same. A good citizen for North Korea and a good citizen for Sweden, I think isn’t the same, no? You’re being complex again. I think you’ll fail the test for sure. But it’s true, no? Your test doesn’t cover every country in the world, right? I’m a good citizen everywhere, all over the world. How? How are you a good citizen? A good citizen knows her boobies and how to carry them out. You idiot. Calm down. Or the... Humans... Civilization... Strange in the home... How much... Crossing boarders... Very important for the Self... Believing in... Without reasons... Figures that move... Be grateful... Nevermore... Unsuccessful... Accept as the words... Will give in and return... Death... And misery... Pain of... Agony... As if humankind... Science... Spreading in... Seeing the phenomenon in the world... Nevermore... Until the world ends...

I think you’re starting to enjoy this too much and forget that we’re here for revenge. How long are you gonna keep playing? Just give me a minute, all right? Vicky! Vicky! Wake up! Wake up! Vicky! Wake up! Vicky! Vicky! Wake up! Get out of here. Vicky! Let's go. Get out of here. Wait. Wait. Do you have my phone? This is the first thing you fucking ask for? Let’s take a selfie.
