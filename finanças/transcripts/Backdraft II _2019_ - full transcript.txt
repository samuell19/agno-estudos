We went out at night. Black smoke. You can see me, right? You want me to find you. I see you. Everything free? - Yes - All right. McCaffrey, it's a disaster, try not to make it worse. Yes. Hey, did anyone move it? No. There is a burned filter, to your left. Your partner said that the He left smoking in bed. - The subject of the red sweatshirt? - Yes He said that when the place was already burning. Yes. He tried to reach her. Could not. Tequila. You're right, the fire started in the mattress. Accident for tobacco products. I did not say that. Help him with those stairs! - Just before the fire? - Yes I tried, but I burned my hands. - Officer, I'll take care of it. - Yes Hi how are you? - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. What is your name? I'm ... Dylan. I'm sorry... I still can not believe it. Relax, I understand. Dylan, Was your girlfriend in bed alone? Yes. I was seeing one movie in the armchair. I should have fallen asleep and for when I woke up ... Yes, I understand, I understand. But when someone is burned alive, they always, even asleep, by reflection, they move away from the fire, but your girlfriend did not. Also, nobody sleeps in the middle of a king size bed. Choose one side or the other. When you place a person unconscious in bed, you put it in the middle, because it's simpler So you will understand that someone like me wonder: "In analyzing this, will I find more than agave inside? " Fuck you, damn you! God! Who you are? I am a firefighter. DPTO. OF RESEARCH OF CHICAGO FIRES 46 and 17 - OFI, can I help you? - Good day. Did you manage to sleep? If I support my head on the steering wheel for 20 minutes counts as that. Hey, Sean, the Captain wants to see you. - What was it called? Warren? - Webber. He's been here for a month, it's Watts. They have no remedy. Captain? Did you want to see me? Take a seat, please. Good job with the Homicide of the bride. You have a congratulation of the Homicide Lieutenant. Doyle? Did he choke on saying it? I feel like "thank you" and "Fire Department"... they do not leave your mouth often. Yes, but we are not the Dept. Fire Department, right? Temporary work order for Maggie Rening in the Dept. Arson course, He is an Officer of Peace ... and with arms. Why is he telling me this? It is your new partner. What? Just a moment... Teams of two, are the rules. We had never had companions, because right now? Because for a long time nobody he cared about directing this Unit. Hey, the only reason why that a suppression Captain ... as you ask for this position, is to polish your resume ... before being Squad Chief and I understand, yes, but you do not understand how we work... and if you are step like the others, what about the fireman with handcuffs It will seem wrong in principle. We offer a good deal, You can study all day to accredit your exam, but instead... let us work our way, yes? Yes, it was in suppression. Do you want to know in what fires worked? West Haddon Street. I know what he did in that Church. And as his uncle is an assistant Head of the Unit, nobody dares to say it, but I do. I do not fear firefighters with handcuffs. I fear the firemen which are a threat. For the record, I have never asked my uncle anything. You can return to your tasks. - Hi, I'm Maggie Rening. - Yes Let me guess, Four years in a squadron? Five. Do you know something about this job? Bad fire, right? Hey, wait for me! Do not run! We must arrive with the Hunter, before it gets dark! Hurry, lazy people. I change you a chocolate, for that candy. Quick, it's your turn. Ask him more. Do not forget to ask for more. Mrs. Hunter, we're here. Eric, stronger. - Play again, strong! - Will there be anyone? Try to open I hope he made cookies. You have to enter. Trick or treat! Mrs. Hunter? - Here you go sir. - Thank you. With extra lamb's tripe? Are you still wearing that jacket? It was my father's. And he was my brother. Are you harassing me? You do not have to be Sherlock Holmes to locate you Only the stench of the Sean's favorite dish. - Does this conversation have a point? - Yes Yes. You can not disturb each Captain, that comes to your Unit. Does my uncle or the Assistant Chief? They say both. I am an adult, I can take charge. That each one is isolated more time down there. Good... I did not join a bowling tournament. See you later. We have one Well, do not talk, just listen to me, to the building, to the fire, and to everything. It is understood? Yes? Hello... There are five, until now. All children, they asked for sweets. We believe that one tried to open and ... - God! - Yes Walking Are you free in there? Yes, free. Unhook that, roll up those that are wet. There is no sign of a incendiary device, but the door exploded when opened. It was a blaze. Hey, if you do not listen to the building before entering ... do us both a favor and Wait in the truck, okay? Okay, Rening, what do you think? Short circuit in the plug. The fire did reach the outlet, but he could not start there. Cracks of intense heat, smoke stain ... agree with many points. The lists only cover the physics of the fire, you must also understand what he wants There's nothing there near that spread the fire, and this spread ... Look at the crystal. If it had originated in the plug, He would have stayed there for a while, he would have settled and searched for fuel. It would have melted crystal evenly, not uneven as it is. That requires extreme heat comes from an address. You know what? You're right, the fire did pass through the plug, but it was an effect secondary or something real. Or they manipulated it for make us believe he started there. And the lower part, where is the plug, It is not as burned as the upper walls. It means that the fire happened more time up, down, so he had to enter by up somehow. One second. The fire did not start in the room. It came from the pipelines, from another place. Waste. Hot enough to Mark the metal without melting it. Look where you step. That is the boiler. The origin is at bottom of that pile. Time to dig. Thank you. Enjoy it. And you? I? I'll go for dessert. Care behind. Do I have four cases of dead children unresolved? There are five, if you know how to count, and I still do not know. If they burn, they are yours. They are so many children. Yes, too many. Have you found the owners? It seems that there was no one at home, Tuohy is reviewing the files. It can not become a show with the press. I need you to discover the cause as soon as possible. Was it murder or an accident? Yes. Hears. Do we understand each other? It started in the air conditioning. And he used the pipelines to Arrive home. I need some light. The switch was not activated. The calibration screws They did not have insulation. That error could cause a peak of energy ... and overload the mechanism. Discoloration indicates that this cable It received the highest temperatures. If the heat source came from the cable ... as an energy overload, I would have melted the plastic coating, but if not, the source of heat came from outside the cable, A splash of gasoline. It was on purpose. It seems that it was on purpose, so that it looks like a accidental overload. In case nobody believed that the plug was the point of ignition. Chief McCaffrey, is he your uncle? Technically. We have something? Or nothing? The coroner has only done analysis preliminaries in the bodies. Five males, all under 15 years old. Death cause? In the preliminary opinion of forensic, the fire killed them. There are five deaths in our charge. Or yours, to be exact. If it was the fire, I think I can retire. What do you think, Sean? Homicide? I still do not know, but it's hard that an accident caused it. No need to tell you that neither councilor at City Hall ... will declare that was intentional. Not even the Mayor, who is dealing with the homicide rate this year, Not the police and neither do we. - Will the ATF be involved? - Do not. Sean already ruined that relationship for a long time. Kunz? He is an idiot. I could not empty urine from a boot, nor with instructions. What do you know about the family? The Hunters, Rod and Jan, marriage without children. Disappeared I will tell you what we will not do. Until you find the Hunter and confirm cause and origin ... We will not say anything. Nobody will insinuate anything, will you? Tell me something we know. The survey turned out in half tracks. Maybe there is a gang attacking houses in the area. The crosswalk camera could show images of a car Identify the car I want these imbeciles out of the streets as soon as possible. All right? Clear. By the way... Who you are? Maggie Rening. Rening? It was assigned with Sean. Rening Wonderful. Now we are officially the Island of broken toys. I want the culprits with a bow before giving statements. Yes. Hey, they already shouted at me at work, yes? On the North side of Lincoln Park, in the wake of the devastating explosion tonight ... that claimed the lives of 5 children, They asked for sweets for Halloween, neighborhood families left flowers and notes of condolence, and they wonder how Something like that could have happened. Firefighters are still investigating the house that burst into flames. Its owners, Rod and Jan Hunter, they have not yet been located ... and the Officers urge who has information ... about his whereabouts, to contact them Doubts about the cause of fire are on everyone's mind. The members of the Municipal Council They demand answers. Was it an accident or a intentional fire? Something is certain: The lives of five Lincoln Park families ... and this community, they will never be the same again. Reporting live from ... Sean! Sean! Sean! I can not believe that You will go through that pipeline alone. It is not your method. I knew it. They modified you. In agreement. What, are you going to move? How did you go inside? Burning things do not bother you. Hey, that's enough, you understand? Stop. Yes, that's better. This is done. This is not what it seems, just I leave food lying on the street. Rening, Rening. I did my homework, There was a fireman named Rening. Two prizes in a year, for saving lives in fires. Heavens, it must be some record, right? It is not. Nobody becomes a firefighter to carry a weapon. They go to OFI because they are so bad, that they can not work at the front ... or, they fail to forget the fire, and none is applied to you. Yes? Which one do you enter? I? I'm over all the categories. Maybe you are both. Why are you here, Rening? It was not them. Lt. Doyle found the plate near the scene by a camera. They had gas and levers in the car. I do not doubt that these cretins will plot something, but it was not that building. Why are you so sure? Because these idiots They had gas in the car. That is for beginners. Burns twice as hot, spreads as a runaway horse ... and it goes off in the Half the time The chromatography of cable gases ... shows Benzyl Nitrate everywhere, not gasoline, with a touch of Linoleum to hide it, but not enough To confirm. That's what professionals use, burns at less temperature, it takes longer to bite, but when it does, clings like a Gila monster. Who did it is cunning enough to try to incriminate a plug, and lead us to a failure of switch if we discovered it, and even more for cheating the fire at use Benzyl Nitrate in the duct ... and hide it with traces of Linoleum Hydrocarbons. Who did this is more cunning than anyone who has seen. Not the most astute. He has been imprisoned for decades. Ronald Bartel. Operates at another level. - Ronald Bartel. - Do not worry about him. Hey, Doyle. The hunters still do not appear. I understand your frustration. I need you to send more men to look for them. Why would I approach that? They burned, they are yours. One of the children does not He died by fire. I thought the theory was that a flare killed them. The door killed him. That is a blunt blow. You would not dare, you would not. Do you want to see how many of them Can I throw at your feet? - Well, I'll send a team. - That's how it is done. Oh my god, What are you doing here, Kunz? I imagined you making bonfires in Alaska after your last call. ATF, investigation and the insurer. - And they gave it to you in charge? - They did not name you. - Who is she? - Maggie Rening. - Hello. - Why are you putting your nose in here? The City Council maybe want a second opinion. And the ATF has funds and personnel to investigate a foreign fire? Two subjects enter a building, only one comes out. Do you know something, Kunz? You trust too much in your manager. I still solve cases. And I do it without masturbate with fire. Yes, get away from me fire. Do you always do so many friends in a day? DPTO. OF RESEARCH OF CHICAGO FIRES 46 and 17 I was going to dinner. I thought you would want to come. I have plans. It's your mother's birthday. Send him a hug. They will miss you, again. Talk to her husband about that. You know, Sean, I always remember those days ... With your father... All the time. Yes, good... Thanks for trying. I'll call mom. But you will not come. Like I said, I have plans. You scare him, did you know? Apology? To the old man. We are friends. I come all the time, he is the owner. I had seen you here before. It makes you panic. No. I helped him a while ago, we are friends. Did you help him? Please tell me. How? His kitchen kept on catching fire. I researched and discovered what another restaurant, shed fat by roof ventilation. I caught the bad guys, that's all. - And the owner was grateful. - Yeah sure. And he told you to come. Yes, here I concentrate. So you come often? Sorry, who are you? Jenny You're a cop? Firefighter. Something like that. Fire investigator, and you? Geologist Seriously? Sure, geologist. And how did you meet old Tommy? He is my father. Fuck. But we do not talk anymore. So, you just come to visit? Question, who are you? - Seriously? - Seriously. In agreement. Well, I am a son and a grandson of dead firefighters. I investigate fires, not because I like fire, but because I understand it. But that does not matter to them to some in my work. And you? Single daughter of a traditional father ... who repudiates me because I'm thirty, without a husband ... and I'm looking for oil, for foreign millionaires, so I'm like a prostitute for him. I burned my house stepfather when he was a boy. Because you understand fire, but you do not like it? Touch. My father thinks I am reincarnation of his son who lost in an abortion. The last time I saw my father, we prepared breakfast for my mom. I do not remember the last time I saw my mother. Everyone I know They fear me or fear me. - I'm very good at what I do. - I am better. In agreement. Sorry. Did I ruin it? Maybe. Doyle has not found the Hunter, but he sent what the police have. Something interesting? The couple was bankrupt, the Prosecutor accused the husband of money laundering, but abandoned it. Find out how much They charged for the insurance. Squadron three, machine seven. Fire in local Two-story commercial. The smoke seems to communicate between floors by a central core. - I see blue smoke in the roof line. - Dammit. Battalion 3, investigation 4-2-2 on the way, do not move. Touhy and Ruckets will not go? I know this idiot. Weaken the structure of the roof. Blue smoke is a chemical ignition, the fire will reach the central core. We must avoid it or all the structure will collapse. Boss, it's urgent, tell everyone Get out of the building, now! That nobody is inside. Take them out, now. On one side, on the side! Give me the hose! Stay here! Do not move! High! Stop! Do not move! - High! - Do not! - Motherfucker! - Stop, stop! I told you that if you did that again, I would kill you, you damn asshole. Enough! Pathetic lights torches, Do you think fire dances for you? Piece of trash. Leave it, Sean! You can not stop them, if you do not catch them in the act, and I'm tired of this imbecile. Sean, bring a doctor. You hurt him, Bring an ambulance! So you weaken the ceiling before the fire, right? It makes them fall faster. Customers like it Homeless, The insurance covers the entire building. That also catches firemen. I do it in empty buildings, I do not kill people. It's good that you have standards. Yes, not like that insane of Lincoln Park. The fire of Halloween? I would not do that, nor because they paid triple. Did anyone offer to pay you for the Lincoln Park fire? I heard rumors. But like I said, I do not burn people. Our damn Sean McCaffrey He has burned more than me. These rumors, they said why they wanted to burn that house? This guy knew about fires. It is something insane. Did you have a talk with Charlie Matches? They were looking to hire someone to burn the house. That unhappy guy told you that? I did not push it through a window, so yes, I think so. Excuse me, I have to talk to the subject of the fire. Not until they have attended. In agreement. He will not talk to you. Yes? Why not? Because I told him not to do it. - Fuck. - So is. Hi, Sean. Who? Ronald Bartel, our most lethal incendiary ... from the cow of the Mrs. O'Leary. Asylums, Orphanages, maybe hundreds more than we'll ever know ... since his specialty is Make them look like accidents. The boy McCaffrey. You never went to visit me. Your uncle Brian, yes. What are you doing outside of your cage? I accumulated a lot of sugar. I swallowed everything. I am diabetic. It's my secret joker to get out of jail. Sit down, We have a lot to talk. Yes. Lincoln Park? You can not find out what It happened with fire, right? You know in the background that it must be intentional, but you can not prove it and that consumes your life. - Wait in the truck. - What? Do it. This is absurd. Are you a fire researcher? No, it does not look like it Not like Rimgale had it. As you have it. How do you know about my fire? Those interested in these things we are everywhere. Some are guests of the State, others no. And some are so good that hack databases. The Investigations, for example. They get photos, reports, conjectures and then share them. - Yes - Do you want to share, Sean? Let's go. Well, I'll say it first. Lincoln Park I read the Department's report. And says... That there was only one source of ignition. That's silly. Did not you look at your photos? I do. Too hot, Sean, sent by the pipeline so fast ... that devoured so much Oxygen, as to create an explosion. Someone had a secret there. And you know what, Ronald? You are going to tell me. No, sharing is a process. And we take turns. That was my turn to share. Now it's you turn. I want you to share with me the fire of ... West Haddon Street. When you finally cornered Wicek, How many churches had he burned already? Eight, right? You stopped when you saw him, did not you? Just a moment. Just to admire it. Because Wicek created a real work of art. And he summoned the dragon. The dragon spoke to you, Sean, and you listened. You understood what the dragon said. Yes, of course you stopped. It was irresistible. God, I've lived it. The duel of fires more big story My God, my God! I have one more question Is not it my turn to ask? Yes, of course, of agreement. I will ask later. So that all that heat is move so fast through the pipeline, a layer would have been required of an additional catalyst. But you did not see any sign of that, or if? The answer should be a secondary ignition source. But you looked for it and not You found it, right? And you checked everywhere. You checked everything Did you look for cellulose and Mercury? You see it? Sharing can be good. No, wait, wait! I said I had a question. I know how lonely it can be for someone like you Have you already gotten into the flow? Listen out. The circles marked on the pipeline? They were caused by a singular detonator, powered by a micro battery. The fire consumed him, How did I not see it? In agreement. Walking Sean? Sean? Ghosts with eyes of fire. Sean! It's me. I am them. Sean You evaded the kennel one more night, do not? What are you doing? Seriously? You start in the unit of air conditioning. Slow, find your rhythm. Then they guide you through the pipelines. Because you are hungry. You know it's bait, but you bite it. Bencilo, the cellulose detonator ... he made you walk the pipelines quickly. But you could never breathe. A house so old, without air? You should have found a window, a crack in the wall, Find more Oxygen to continue. But something caught you. He held you back, made you lose control. He left you in silence for hours. Hundreds of degrees, everything ready but without where to go. What did you find? What did you find? Do you smell something strange? This is how they got you. They sealed the air and took the place in a box of frustration. Do you always investigate outside of service in the middle of the night? So I work, what is your excuse? You have a dog. It's street. But he has talent, apparently. Do you have a name? If it had a name, it would be mine. I kept investigating you. But nobody likes to talk about you. Heroine, saved a child twice before the age of three. Articles in the newspaper, awards. The face of the new Department. But if you inquire enough, and that I did, there is another story. The firefighter who steals things where he fights fires. Please, what is that? It's like being a child molester in this job. What was it? All that attention? All those expectations you Did they want to hurt you? You know what? You got a last please for those awards. As a last chance, they sent you for Suppression a Research ... because we do not do charity here You do not know me But I think I can guess. Yes? Maybe you know everything about the pressure of the rumors. Plumber's clay. They sealed the points of air outlet with that. It burns completely. Thanks to the dog I discovered it. They wanted to burn the interior of the house completely. Yes. I have nowhere else to go. Nowhere. And what do you want me to do with that? I can be good at this. Sure, okay. What does all this tell you? A lot of work to attack a couple that was not even at home. Yes, I do not think it was the owners. I think it was for the house itself. They needed not only to burn it, but eliminate it. Why do not you go to home and what do you think? I see you tomorrow. Do you know anything about the Hunter or not? As I told your partner, financial chaos, especially for your company, Hunter Systems. What does Hunter Systems manufacture? He is a subcontractor of some kind, NATO ... Where is? Improvement of the missile AIM-1-20 of NATO. There were problems of quality control with the Defense specifications. The Hunters moved money ... so that the company live to solve them. They are in trouble or not. Defense, the Prosecutor and the Federals do not decide. We already did this with the Police and Defense supervisors. Nobody knows anything about Jan and Rod Hunter since the fire in your house. Roger Hunter spent a lot time in your office? Depending on the project status. It is your company. Did they have production problems? I can not give details, but there were orders to redesign the optics of the missile seeker. It's part of the AIM-1-20 what we do And then there was the fire. Fire? In our test bench. The technicians did the first integrated trial ... with a functional prototype of new AIM Rathyeon they sent. Unfortunately, in the night there was a fire ... that destroyed the prototype. Caused a delay and reduced the income stream. Did they have insurance? Of course. The fire was declared accidental. But our insurer was delayed with payments. Why? They are an insurer. Who investigated the fire? We are in a small suburb with volunteer firemen. They do not have a dedicated Department. As it is a federal contract, They sent someone from the ATF. The ATF had a name? Ralph Kunz We'd better see the scene of that fire. It accumulated inside. I was looking to breathe, like the house of the Hunter. Can I use the word? Flare? I think I already did it. Where did the researcher mark the origin of fire? Over there. What is this? A cooling plant. The rocket was disarmed. The fuel is It ignited with the heat. Basically there was nothing left after. How about we look here? And we find traces of Bencilo and Linoleum? How convenient, a fire with a missile prototype inside. Why would he burn his house? If the Defense Department had quality control problems, I could stop an investigation. Insurance money it would be useful. But the insurer delayed with payments. Maybe they suspected the statement accident of Kunz, like us. - McCaffrey. - Doyle. A car fire that could interest you, in a lot, right now in the outskirts of Kensey. Knowing, we are on the way. Are they the hunters? It's your car. I will take samples and DNA to confirm it, but I bet yes. Maybe they were cited here for see someone or they abandoned them. It was already on fire when the police saw it. - If it burns, it's yours. - Yes Quiet, It is still the scene of a crime. God, Kunz, You are like a fake coin. Why do you get in a auto fire in my city? Speak with the plaque. The one of the Federal that is over there. McCaffrey. Agent Johnson. Is there a good place close to eat something? Hunter was almost bankrupt with this missile subcontract. Rod got money where I could to stay afloat. And they defrauded the insurer with the missile fire? I'm sure Hunter He ordered to burn it, no matter what the ATF says, but not for insurance. The AIM-1-20 missile It was very important. I could knock down any military aircraft. Thank you. In the Pentagon, they were alarmed after the fire. The Inspectors filled the place looking for parts of the remaining missile. There was not much, but it was enough to see that what It burned there, it was a model. A substitute for true prototype. Then the wife enters. When he saw that Defense he did not fall into the trap, He came into my office and confessed everything. How her husband planned sell him the real one, with that terrifying technology next generation ... to an intermediary who Then I would sell the plans ... to any entity foreign willing to pay them. So, Hunter handed him the missile to this intermediary? That is the question. She took the missile to another place, without saying anything to her husband. Neither that was with us to negotiate. He promised us all the evidence ... and the location of the missile in a hard drive in exchange for immunity. And then they disappeared. Good... I think the intermediary Maybe he paid Rod, and when he did not deliver, because of his wife, I imagine they were tormented enough before burning them. Definitely. And it is likely that she tell where the missile was, but given that their bodies they were abandoned today, They had to catch them recently, so it's likely that the bad guys have not been able to move the missile yet. You do not document how something so big luggage. They will have to take it to a third country on a ship. We have devices that detect Propellants of Hydroxybutyl Butadiene ... at all exit points. They could not find the hard drive. That's why they used the flare. A flare is cooked by hours before exploding, I would incinerate any evidence inside. They had to make sure. Maybe they killed her before that he will tell you about us. Yeah it was like that, we want you to lower your guard ... to catch them when try to move the prototype. Five children died there. I want to catch the responsible ones. Do not declare it intentional It will still help me to achieve it. And by not being intentional, Defense and its contractors they do not have to explain ... how a secret missile ended up in an enemy country. That has nothing to do? Come on, an accidental fire silence many conversations, right? We want the same as you. It is funny. When someone He says that, it's not true. What's wrong, fuck? Someone was here. I bet you were our friends of the FBI looking for the hard drive. I do not care what the Hunter did with your money or your missile, you know? But try to cover up things with fire ... It is a great crime. I am sorry for your loss. Eric A boy so sweet. So brilliant. You could not get angry with him, you were busy laughing. When we moved, Eric did not take long to get friend of my son. Hears. Hears. Did you know the hunters? Eric, yes. We used to... She gave us cookies sometimes. Did you know the house? We bury our dinosaurs there, but Mrs. Hunter He was very angry with us. He said that if we wanted to dig, we went to play at the park. The boy was right. I took it out of the Hunter's garden. It seems damaged by water. Contact the Doyle technician and see what you can get out of there. And keep it a secret. I won Detective points for finding the hard drive? A little more and I will strive to remember your name. We treat the dogs as if they were human too ... with thoughts, emotions and behaviors of a relative. It is our closest relationship and lasting with another species. We share life, our home, even our bed with them. It's okay. What did you expect? Do not look at me like that. It is the special of the house. Here you have. No parties after eleven. Well, Jan Hunter's hard drive It was damaged by moisture. The technician found several things, some made sense, others not so much. But our job is to analyze these impressions of the hard disk ... and see if something connects with the fire. Find the missile and we will find the culprit. Rening God! This thing is illegible. What are these numbers? They could be measured. But I can not get dimensions make sense. Is it a code? It seems linked to some input of Hunter Systems that she did. A second, they're not measurements, guys. They are minutes and seconds. They are coordinates, latitude and longitude. From where? It is the main office of Slick-X Couriers shipments. I need to see the order. I'm going for it. Drag marks. There is room to store a missile. What happens? Motherfucker. Fuck. The same detonator as the house of the hunters. High! Do not move! I know the arsonists of the city, but not you. Who do you work for? All the world. For no one. We do not care and we do not ask. You really do not know anything. - Ronald is wrong with you. - Shut your damn mouth. You paved this place to burn evidence. Do not be silly, we are Police! They are only firefighters in the wrong place Behind! Go back! Get in the closet! Lower your head, lower your head. We must get out of here. He knows that if he moves, it will cause a sudden combustion, And now the fire is stabilizing. This is about one thing alone, and it's time, do you understand? He must be still, but he wants to run. Let him move first! - Are you crazy! - Look at me! Trust me! No matter how it looks, when I tell you to run, let it move first. Wait wait. Not yet, wait. Wait! Wait! Now, run! Sean! Wait for the dragon. Sean! - Feel your breathing. - Sean! - I see you. - Sean! Sean! Sean! I got out! Help me! - Please! - Fuck. Please help me! Help! Help me! Please someone help me! - Are you alone? - My dad is the supervisor. - You'll be fine, I'll get you out of here. - Father! Hold on tight. Hold on I have you. Hold on Seventeen, walking, in a hurry. Already! Get that out of the way! Resist, resist, I have you. Hold on, do not let go! - Sean. - Do not look down. Do not look down, I have you. Seventeen, in a hurry! Stairs! Quick! Let's go! Do not give up, friend, you can. Let's go! Resist, almost. A little more. Yes, I have you, calm. - Let's go! - Very well. Sean! Fallen firefighter, fallen fireman. Everything will be fine, I have you. Sean? Can you hear me? Sean! Ray. Look what I found. Any fracture? How will I know? Rening managed to escape safely? It's okay. He is with the others. I will need help to get out of here. I thought so. Now. You know? I thought we could talk. Are you crazy, Could you get me out of here? We have time, at least have a hemorrhage or ... Let this wall fall on you. Oh my God, This family is insane. Well, uncle, what do you think? How long will you blame me for the death of Stephen? We have all night, right? You were not there, Sean. You do not know what happened. I know you could barely you changed to Suppression, because you do not have the guts. Not like your brother, or your father. You do? Fuck you I would have surpassed it. Or you would have died like everyone in this damn family. Why do not you tell me what happened? Because, Sean, there are things from that day that ... Nobody should know. You have to trust me. I could not do anything to change that day. Lie! Lie! You were there, you could save him! You do not understand it? I need to know What happened. Brian, it was always like that. Sean Your father died trying Save your best friend. But his best friend He was an incendiary. Adcox was an incendiary. Sean ... If there is something that I have learned is that ... It is that there is more to cling to to this family dysfunction, again and again and again, this ... Please. I hope you can... Find the way to overcome it. Before it's too late. Sounds like that wall is about to collapse. So is. It's not that we're interested, right? Since we are McCaffrey. You have to get out of here. Hey, 17! I have it, 17. I found it. The same. The damn one above. He did not confess, there is no evidence, Not even a damn name. You are amazing. What? You walked between flames. You saved a girl, you threw yourself, from a third floor? And nothing happened to you. That's the best thing that happens in This job, believe me, I know. When I saved those two children ... Nothing could touch me. Until he did it. That was after. But, at the moment ... When it was only mine, I shouted at the How impressed I was. Yes... Your? You are sitting drinking and thinking about fires. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - What's happening to me? I'll tell you what's wrong, I am a terrible fireman. I stink in camaraderie, the tales, the "happy we fight the fire", and all that. I will never have the responsibility of my grandfather ... or the charisma of my father, or the disturbing my uncle's perspective. I always ruin everything in this job, except one part: To beat the fire. I do not cry enough for what I see. I do not know anyone's name, I do not care about 99% of the people that spends Oxygen around, but nobody catches more incendiary than me. Maybe all of that do wrong fireman, or maybe, just maybe, I become the best there is ... And I'm not really interested which of the two is For two terrible firemen. Hi Mom. I'm fine. Your list of visitors this year. Very well. Who are you? Do I hear a McCaffrey out there? Where are you going, Sean? Will you go back to West Haddon Street? Sean? Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean? What? Was the bowling hall closed? They want to declare the Hunter fire as "indeterminate". Just kidding? - If there is no evidence ... - I was not talking to you. I'm the researcher in charge here. I will not sign that. You are no longer the leader of the case, Sean. They can not do that, without a cause. The guy you pushed Through the window? He filed a formal complaint. Damn idiot, this is absurd. There are witnesses who heard Rening yelling at you for that. It was not my intention... It's an incendiary, burned the building that burned it! But anyway, yes? That complains. I will defeat it without problems, Do not take me out of my case. It is done. Kunz. I swear to God... Soto want a connection between research and the ATF, so they will allow it for now. With this idiot? Two subjects enter, only one goes out. I'm not happy either, right? No way. But for now, it's done. You are low until decide on the battery ... Dammit! To the hell with everything. To hell Chief Soto, the FBI, and everyone who says that This is not intentional. All except the mothers of those children. Please, Brian, do not do it. I'm so close. If you bite the language from time to time, Your career would not be going away. If I bite my tongue, I finish with his mouth full of blood. Take some time, Sean. - Calm down. - Whatever. Damned. GAS COMPANY SECOND SUN Hi. Everything is fine? Hi. Can you stay tonight? I need to see you. Can you really do it? I think they already did. Did you find out what those numbers were? No, in part, they were several places in the city, but we do not know how they connect. Could they be keys to mobile towers? What do you mean? I saw it in projects Oil tankers in Saudi Arabia. Instead of taking care of each project, They put trackers in the machinery. Wait, what? They had integrated accelerometers that were activated when moving them. When entering the rank of a tower, They called home. This is very similar. Did the hunters put a tracker What are you looking for? Maybe the wife did it. Hi, can you check with a mobile company? See if any number that I You sent it matches the towers. Yes, all right, call me. Are you going to review it? I hope, I can not approach now, but ... Thank you, Jenny, it was amazing. Did you give him a name? If it had a name it would be mine. What happens? Hears. Hey, wake up. Above. Fuck. Hey, Jenny. Jenny, wake up. What? - Awake. - What's going on? What does it smell like? Do not move. - What? - Listen to me. Listen to me. It's gas, it's coming through the floor. Look at me, I'm not kidding. There is a switch ignition under the bed ready. If we get up, it explodes ... Will it explode? Easy, listen to me. I can keep my weight on him. And you can go out, but make it slow, okay? You can do it. Slow. Ahead. Do it. Slow slow. Let me settle. Hears... Slow... For for. OK carry on. Ok, now get out of here and call the station. - And leave you here? - Jenny, listen to me. - I will not do it. - Listen to me! The sooner you make the call I have more chances Go fast! Dammit. Devils. You could tell me before. Do not look at me like that. You would have done better in the kennel, friend. - It's in the room. - Get away from here. Fuck, Sean. Squad 36 on the way. - What, Hector? - Second shift, Masey. Very well. Garay, they have you trapped down there. Is that gas? Yes, maybe they connected it from the stove ... in a way that make a bang What do I do now? I try not to think about what are you going to do? No wait. Where are you going? To disconnect the source. No, maybe they put traps in case the gas smelled, before it was activated. If Masey knows what he's doing, will use its blocks to replace my weight ... and let me out before the time ... - Ray. - What did you do? There may be a second timer I'm not sure. I'm going to turn it off below. Brian, get out of there. Brian, get out of the building. Do me a favor. Close your mouth and do not move. Do not be stupid, get out of here. I'm going to divert the gas away from you. Brian, get out of the building! I will not let him die another McCaffrey! You will see two die, if you do not leave now. I'm sorry, not again. Brian! Get out of here! Brian! Present arms! You were right. The numbers were mobile towers. The latest connections They were near Calumet. It is far from the tower, The search range is extensive. It covers half of the warehouses of the South part. Nobody has the staff to look in so many places. And with the ATF with the fire and Kunz that declares it indeterminate ... We do not have resources. It depends on the FBI. To the devil the Town Hall and the Federals. With or without orders ... Whatever you want, what you need ... We'll help you with this, Sean. First I must do something. Thank you. Did a cat fall on your head? - Did you bring the sugar? - I did not bring your sugar. I only came for one thing. You are so bad. I'm sorry about your uncle Brian. I read what they wrote of him in Research. - Yes - It seemed nice. I only saw it once. And what is that thing? The professionals who visited you, Who did they work for? To what foreign agency were they going to sell the package? The Russians? The Chinese? Seriously? They did not tell me anything about that. So what did they want? What? They were just looking for what every applicant a dragon tamer wants. To be able to sit with the man who He knows how to converse with the dragon. Did you help them with the Lincoln Park fire? Sean, no! Do not! I have a reputation. I only told them about the dragon. Well, how would they get the country package? Package? Why would they tell me about that? Because the language of they are fire, right? Do not. They do not speak the language of fire. Not like us. You and I do not talk the same language. Please, Sean. Of course yes. You love talking to the dragon, just like me. And the dragon loves to talk with us, and you know. And poor Rimgale. It is what he always wanted. But the dragon did not dance for him. It is true. Only for you and me, Sean. When your uncle Brian and Rimgale they came to see me here, They came to interview the Devil. Did you know that if any you came to see me, You would know that you would see your alter ego. You would see ... To another you. Hello, another me. Cooperate with me How will they get the Chicago package? I do not know anything about the package. Nothing, can you hear me? But I will share a story with you, if you share another with me. Damn it, listen to me, you son of a bitch, This is not a conversation. Okay, what story? Two subjects enter a building, only one comes out. You know what? Fuck off. I told you in the hospital that still I had a question to ask. The answer you could give be liberating for you, Sean. He had already lit his fire in the Church of West Haddon. I imagine it must have been very beautiful. It was about thought ... Very showy, but I saw, for his roars, it was unstable ... and that I could beat it with another fire. So I took a can of mixed fuel ... and I sprayed an answer. Only a little, but enough for both fires they will face, away from the building ... and consumed among them. Ready. Although Wicek was consumed. Yes it was. This is my question. What did you feel when Wicek caught fire? Did you want it to burn? Did you want to burn them all? You have no idea. Trust me... I got it. I got it. Yes I do, Sean. Those two men with false names ... They wanted my opinion ... On what would be the best way to cause an "accidental" fire, in an outside location. And what location was it? Since the required temperature of ignition was minimal ... Given the restriction of fuel mixture ... and the small diameter of the pipe ... Given all that ... I would suggest you look for a location ... with a lot of ... Propane! Are you leaving so soon? Our minds are very similar. Except, of course, that you're crazy. McCaffrey. The tracker called home last night a few hours and he stopped. He must have moved. Good news, It is near a tower. I sent you a search radio. It is smaller this time. Can you check the database for Propane sources in the area? What are you up to, Sean? It will not allow hurt anyone else. Sean? Are you there? Only short-term containers. Shipping companies They use to reorganize deliveries. Well thanks. It is missing a screw. Fuck. It was complicated. That's what I thought. Does the missile propeller smell? That is what he said. You need a battery for that, and I was never here. Thank you. Just keep those children dead away from my desk, yes? Shipping to Nigeria? There you are. Many people are looking for you. Go Go. What are you doing, Sean? Surprise, surprise. Not today there will be an explosion of distraction. What the hell is happening? It should have been activated already. I should have exploded. They will not let us escape with the damn load. Hands up! Get your damn hands up. Now get out of the truck. Now, move! Quick. Let me see your hands. Walk towards me, slow. Keep walking, towards me. Also you, let me see your hands. Abalby down! Down! The hands where I can see them. There will be no explosion, idiot. They are arrested ... High! Maggie, no! Ray! Dammit... Hey, idiot. Do you really think that can you stop us? Go to the devil. You want to kill me? Do it! Maybe the missile is in the container or road to China, you'll never know. You're lying. Yes? It would not be the first time. Get up. Above! Got damn. Maggie, I'm sorry. Sorry. All this, five dead children. Shut up. My buyers see die to your children all the time. They were Americans spoiled for them. Ronald is an interesting subject, do not? Filled with useful ways to start fires. I should have talked to him before. Rening! Rening! Sean Oh my God! Maggie, up, get up. Come on, you can achieve it. You remembered. What? My first name. Is not it beautiful? You came back Forever. What do you do? I think. In which? In that maybe it would not be So bad after all. Be the first McCaffrey in retiring with life. You will need a place to live. Yes. I still have an extra room. In your father's restaurant? - We do not talk anymore, remember? - Yes But there must be less burning things. Clear. Do you already have a name? If it had a name, it would be mine, right? Machine 17, truck 46, respond. At 3,700 from West Madison Avenue, commercial structure of two floors covered in fire, flames are reported through the roof.
