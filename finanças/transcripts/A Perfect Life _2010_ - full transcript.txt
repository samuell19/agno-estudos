They don't expect it to be quite as warm as it was yesterday at least for this time of the year. Patchy morning fog, otherwise mostly sunny and cooler with late storms predicted for the evening. Highs from the 50s at the coast to the 60s inland. Tuesday, some morning low clouds and patchy fog otherwise mostly sunny. Then we'll see some increasing high clouds and cooler temperatures Wednesday... Good morning, baby. Rise and shine. You're not gonna let me sleep in, are you? Now, what kind of loving husband would I be if I let you sleep past your alarm? That was your alarm. I don't need to be up for another 30 minutes. Well, then, I guess we have time to kill. I hope your presentation goes well today. You nervous? Try quietly confident. You want me to drive you in this morning? No, I'm good. Probably gonna have to work late tonight anyway. Don't be too late. We haven't spent much time together lately. Well, that what makes moments like this morning all the more special. Lipstick. If you come home early, I'll make it worth your while. Yeah. Bribery will get you nowhere. It's over. The Giants have pulled off an amazing upset. They handled it well, for the perfect season. Seven forty, KLCB news update. Medical research took a giant leap forward today with local company Rivaltech Industry announcing a brand new cancer treatment that's boasting a 100 percent success rate in test subjects. According to the project's founder, Andrew Walters, chemotherapy is a thing of the past. And in world-- Well, good morning. Don't you look a sight for sore eyes. You're not so bad yourself, Mister. Not like you to be late. What happened? Just tired, I guess. Was up all night prepping this damn speech. Personally, I'd like to cut the crap altogether and get straight to the champagne. No arguments from me. So, do I get a kiss? What the hell was that? Well, you've just done your lips. You don't want me messing them up. That's something Helen would say. Helen? Since when are you on a first name basis with my wife? That's her name, isn't it? So, how's the art classes coming along? Yeah, good. I'm in my last week. Any Mona Lisas on the way? I'm sculpting. But if you did want to compare my progress to a painter, it'd be more like Picasso than Da Vinci. You'll get there, don't worry. I've only got the warehouse for another month. They're tearing it down for development. Now, that is a shame. I've got a lot of fond memories in that building. Well, who knows? You might get to visit it someday soon. So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. The future of our company. You know, if we plan to remain an industry forerunner, and stay competitive, then we as a company need to embrace this new technology today. Thank you. -Congratulations. -Thank you, thank you. -Thank you for coming. -Thank you so much. -That was one hell of a job. -Rob, how are you? -You deserve that partnership. -I couldn't have done that without you. -Hey, we gotta celebrate. -Yeah. -We will. Just give me a moment. -Okay, just one. Come on, baby, pick up. Congratulations, that was quite a speech. I'm glad you liked it. A word of caution. If you start wearing pinstripes and pink, I'm gonna have to hurt you. So has the man of the hour got time for dinner tonight? - Here's to us. - To us. It's so beautiful, isn't it? Something special in the air tonight. Can you feel that? It's just the moon. I guess it's a little closer than normal. Well, it makes you glow. I know I keep saying this tonight, but... you look absolutely radiant. You're such a romantic. But it's not the moon that makes me glow. I'm lucky to have a woman like you. I'm not gonna hang around forever, Andy. I don't wanna be the other woman. I was, saving this for a more appropriate time. Soon as the divorce's finalized, I want you to be my wife. That's beautiful. -So, is that a yes? -Of course, I'll marry you. - Hello? - Hi. What happened? - You promised to call me. - Yeah, I... I tried during the day, but you didn't pick up. I didn't get your message. I, I didn't leave you one. Okay. -Are you coming home soon? -Yeah, I'm almost done here. How did your presentation go? I was thinking of you all day. That, that went better than I thought. Yeah. I'm really starting to think I can make a difference at this firm, you know. But you don't have to do it in one night. It's just a little fine tuning for tomorrow's meeting, okay? -I'll be done. -It's not right they make you work like that. I wish they looked at it the same way. I miss you, Andy. I never see you anymore. And I miss you too, baby. But, you gotta try to get some sleep, okay? Don't be mad. You wouldn't like it if I didn't care. I'm not mad, baby. I, I love it when you call. You know I can't sleep when you're not here. I'll be as quick as I can, okay? Promise? Yeah, I promise. I love you. And I love you. Christ, Rachel. Don't sneak up on me like that. -Who're you talking to? -It's just business. Really? Little late for business, isn't it? Hey, you know how demanding they can be. -Christ! -It was your wife, wasn't it? That sure as hell didn't sound like "we don't get on anymore." And it sure as hell did not sound like, "I'm leaving her." The timing has to be right. When will the timing ever be right, Andy? When? I would never intentionally hurt you, baby. Would you trust me? Please? You asked me to marry you, and you talk to her like nothing has changed. You have to trust me. All right? Come on. Trust me. Please. Please trust me. Come to bed. I'll show you what you'll be missing if you stay with her. Give me a minute. Rachel? -Rachel? -Close your eyes... and turn around slowly. I figured this is the kind of outfit you'd like. Yeah, that's nice. It's what you men want, isn't it? Younger the better. I've played this game before, baby. Right now, I just don't have the time. This is a completely new game. I don't think I've played this with you before. Who am I this time? The janitor? You're the school principal, of course. Put your hand on my leg. You're gonna love this game. I'm sorry, baby. Did I hurt you? Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. What happened? You fell and hurt yourself. My head is killing me. What did you do? It's just a little party mix. I guess it reacted badly with the wine. Where am I? What is this place? You're in my art studio. Baby... you know I don't have time for this. But we haven't finished our game. What's with the chains? You need to be tied up for this one. Why do I have to be tied up? Because that's how we play this game. Maybe some other time. Come on, let me up. You're not going anywhere. Rachel, what's going on? I'm gonna do things for you... that your wife would never dream of doing. Rachel, that's not cool. Rachel! Rachel! Don't leave! Help! Anybody! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Anybody! Hello? Is anyone there? Help! Help me! Help! Hi, Miss Rachel! Hi, Miss Rachel! -Hi, Mr. Samuels. -Hi, Miss Rachel! -How're you this evening? -I'm fine. How're you? They're beautiful. Thank you. I was... going down to the pond. I was gonna pick some glow fish for you. You like glow fish? I love glow fish. You know I love glow fish. Thank you. Be careful though. It's supposed to be cold out there tonight. -Okay? -Okay. Thank you. Got to keep warm. Are you sculpturing tonight? Yeah, I got class tomorrow on a project that just won't finish itself. Okay. I guess I better be going then. -Have fun, okay? Take care. -Thank you. Okay. -Bye-bye, Miss Rachel. -Bye, Mr. Samuels. Here you are. Buy yourself some dinner and a coffee, okay. Thank you, Miss Rachel. Thank you, Miss Rachel. -Stay warm, okay? -Bye-bye, Miss Rachel. - Bye, Mr. Samuels. - Bye. Bye. Have fun. I see your wife has arisen. Hello, Helen. My God! Helen! -Are you okay? Can you hear me? -Andy! -Andy! You okay? -I'm fine. Did she hurt you? I just woke up in here. What is this place? I don't know. Just let me handle this, okay? Enough, Rachel, come on! -This shit is not funny! -How do you know her name? How rude not to introduce myself. I'm the new Mrs. Walters. -Andy, what's she talking about? -How the hell should I know? Just take a look at her. She's completely fucking insane. From now on, I need you to stay calm, okay? We're gonna play a little truth game. You're hooked up to a polygraph machine. Don't let appearances fool you. It's old but it works just fine. Please... This is crazy. I'm gonna ask you a few simple questions. You tell the truth... you live. You lie... Let's just play, shall we? I'm not playing your fucked up little game. Let me go! Andy! What did I say to you? I said stay calm. At least now you know what happens when you lie. I'm gonna ask you a few questions to get started. Why're you doing this to us? I'm sure your wife will have a few of her own as we move along. What do you want? Money? I don't want your goddamn money! I want the truth! What truth? What are you talking about? All in good time, Helen. -Are you ready? -Please, Andy. Just... give her what she wants. -Why are you doing this to me? -Because you lied. And now, you're gonna make it up to me. Rachel, if I've upset you... I sincerely apologize. It was never ever my intention to hurt you. -What's your name? -Andy, you know that-- Your full name? For Christ sake, Rachel! You know my name. Humor me. It's Andrew Walters. That wasn't so hard now, was it? This is so dumb. You know they'll come looking for me. And who are they exactly? Everyone who knows you're missing is right here. Andy! What the hell is this? It sounds like you know this woman. Patience, Helen. The next question is easy. Where do you work? The same place you do. Rivaltech Industries. Good. A few minor adjustments so your aggression won't spoil my fun too soon. Come on, you don't need to do this! Whatever it is, we can work it out! I'd like that to be true. I guess we'll see. You and I know each other rather intimately. Who am I? You're a sick woman who needs help. See, it's true. Where were you last night? I was out. Tell her you were working. It's not that big a deal. Silence is not part of the game, Andy. Where were you? I don't want to hurt you, Andy. I really don't. You don't have the balls. -No, Rachel! No! -No! No, no, no! - Andy! - No! No! Andy! Where were you, Andy? You've only got nine nails left and I've got all night. I was with you! No, you were working. You told me you were working! He was fucking me, Helen. Weren't you? No! Answer the goddamn question, Andy! You were fucking me, -weren't you? -Yes! Please tell me it's not true! What do you hope to get out of this? Satisfaction. This won't help anything. You offered me your heart. And I gave you mine in return. And then you just threw it all away. Is it really true? I'm sorry, Helen. This is not how I wanted you to find out. I've got some more questions. Some simple true or false ones. Haven't you done enough? Isn't... Isn't this what you came for? You told me that you and your wife had grown apart. That she doesn't understand you anymore. True or false? You don't need to do this. True or false? True. You said you didn't love your wife anymore. She gave you no love. No affection. True? True. You promised to leave your wife and live with me, didn't you? Louder. Helen can't hear you. Yes! Yes... Do you love me, Andy? More than your wife? Are you serious? You made love to me. Held me and kissed me, and told me that you loved me. Was that all a lie, too? Any love I had for you... died when you pulled this stunt. You told me that you loved me. And I believed you. I've had enough of these games, Rachel. It's... Did you enjoy fucking me, Andy? -Go to hell! -Answer the goddamn question! Did you enjoy fucking me? -No, Rachel. Don't! No! Come on! Why is it so hard to admit it? Stop it! No! No, don't... I thought I fixed that. Andy, you do need to stay calm. No, Rachel! Don't! Don't! They say the pinkie hurts more but I don't know. -No, no, no, no, Rachel, don’t! -How about that question? Did you enjoy fucking me? Yes! Yes, I enjoyed fucking you! I'm gonna leave you two lovebirds alone to talk for a while. Sure you got plenty to discuss. By the way... I'm pregnant. Helen... Are you there? Are you okay? -Helen. -No, Andy... -I'm far from okay. -I'll make this up to you. I swear it. Make it up to me? How? You're cheating on me, Andy. You're having sex with a... fucking lunatic! I don't know if can ever look past that. This whole thing, it just started... It was just one lie, that's all. Just one. It just became easier to live the lie... than to stop. I'm telling you the truth. You know... how long I've wanted a baby. But it was never the right time. You always had an excuse why it wasn't... suitable. Now, this... I know it sounds bad... Bad? That fucked up bitch is having your baby! My... baby... I don't know what to say to make this better. Andy... why did you marry me? -Because I love you. -But why? What is it about me that... you love? I don't know, I... I just know that I love you! After all these years, you can't think of... anything? I've taken you for granted, haven't I? I just don't get it... I've done... everything for you... You've never wanted for anything. I've supported you. I've been the best wife I can possibly be. Is it... not enough? Everything's gonna be fine, okay? We're gonna be a family again. Pretty girl. Really? You think he'd like to see the dress? I'm gonna try it on for him. Miss me? Do you like my dress? Sure, Rachel, I like your dress. I bought it for you. I was gonna wear it to the fair next week. You said you'd take me, remember? Whatever, Rachel. I'll take you to the fair. It's really important to me that you wanna go. Last thing I wanna do is drag you to where you don't wanna be. I really want to go... I'd say you've got one lie left. You must be wondering what I have that you don't. You know what? I don't care what you say. You can't hurt me anymore. What was it you said, Andy? That's right. You said, "I'm everything she's not." -Fuck you! -Andy likes it rough, Helen. He likes dangerous games. I bet you like the missionary. Fucking bitch! You don't know anything about me! I can see you as a "flat on your back" type. Submissive and boring with no spark. This is not about me, is it? What do you mean? All this! It's about you! You told me that you were adopted. But you never told me why. I can't trust you. You're just like all the others. Use me for what you want and then throw me away. Rachel, please... I know you're hurting a lot deeper inside than you let on. -Let me help you. -You can't. Things like this, they'll eat you like cancer, which is why it helps to talk. Please... My mother... She was forced to... The government said she was too young to look after a baby on her own. Too young to look after me. She was 15 and no one would help her. They took her away from me. The family I went to, they were nice, but... it wasn't the same. When I was ten, they sent me to boarding school. I don't have any happy memories after that. There was one time... Get off me! Stop it! Don't touch me! Stop crying! Stop crying! No! At that moment, I wasn't scared of anything. I had no idea. The matron knew it was me and didn't say anything. She knew what was happening all along and never once tried to help. I know I wasn't the only one. Rachel, please let me up. Let me help you. That was nice chatting. I've to get out of this dress. Andy... God, Andy, are you okay? Do I look okay? Do you remember when we met? Yes. You rode the subway home across the river. I admired you... every day for weeks. But I was too shy to even say hello to you. And then... one day you looked at me... and you smiled. You were so beautiful. You were so embarrassed I caught you staring at me. -I was not. -Yes, you were. That's one thing that I love about you, Helen. Your beautiful smile. After all the years, it's never changed. Sorry, just not right now. I'm so sorry, Helen. What have I done? You promised you wouldn't hurt him! -Relax, he'll be fine. -It's over. It's not even close to over. He's admitted the affair. We can work this out ourselves from now. I'm so pleased for you. Get on your knees! What? It's not over till I say it is. And I've got some more questions. I went along with this... because you promised proof my husband was having an affair. And now, you have your proof. -We had a deal! -I'm changing it. I know who you are. You won't get away. What do you think you're doing? No, Rachel. Don't do this. Let me know if it gets too warm in here. What do you want? What? There's no need to keep this going. Kiss me. Kiss me like you really love me. And I'll let you both go. You serious? Let me down. I think I was fucking the wrong spouse. What do you think, Andy? Personally, I think she's a better kisser than you. This is between you and me. Don't you fucking touch my wife. Don't you see, she is the only thing between you and me getting married. You still don't get it, do you? I'm already married! You're about to be widowed. I swear, Rachel, if you touch her... I'm not gonna kill her. You are. You fucking bitch! Let me down! It's beautiful, isn't it? Andy... I'm scared. I think she's gonna kill us. I know. Just try to think about something else. Something that makes you smile. Do you remember when we went sky diving? The strangest things make you smile. I thought it'd be something special... that we'd remember forever. Yeah. Life-altering experiences are hard to forget. You... You never jumped before. They had to push me out of that plane. I was so proud when you jumped. But your chute never opened. I mean, we never even saw yours open. But that's when I knew I was in love with you. You fell in love with me on the third date? I could have sworn I had you on the fifth. The way it felt... That's how it feels... when you lose someone you love. I don't wanna lose you, Andy. What the hell are you trying to do? Keep that up, you'll hurt yourself. I need a drink. -Promise to behave? -Yeah. See, I'm not a total bitch. Rachel, it's not too late for us. We can work this out. I wanna show you something. Look at this one. That's my wedding pictures. How did you get those? The ground was so muddy. You lifted me up so that I wouldn't dirty my dress. I need to tell you something. -What is it? -Come closer. I don't want Helen to hear. -What do you wanna say? -Closer. What is it, baby? Damn it! Fuck! You fucking fuck! No! Andy! My God! I've got something more appropriate for your demise than a plastic bag. There's no need to look at me like that. He won't love you like we love you. Kill him. I said stop it! He's just like all the others. You're right. He's just like all the others. I think I know how to beat the polygraph. Andy, listen to me. It's a little late for that now. Answer the questions with statements, not yes or nos. What's happening? I think she's coming. The bandages are a nice look. Didn't you see how all the empty promises hurt? For what it's worth, Rachel, I'm so truly sorry. Drink up. Rachel... I need to go... to the bathroom. You'll have a chance to relieve your bladder soon. I've just connected these buttons, so first things first. This button on your left... will raise the spikes... and set you free. It comes with a price. It also ignites the furnace your wife is in. What? If you love me, you'll push it. No one has to know. No one ever has to know. What about this one? That will set your wife free... but releases the spikes. - Tough choice? - I won't choose. You can't make me. I thought you might say that. Andy, I'm in trouble. I can smell gas. Baby... you have to try to get free. Miss me? What the hell do you... you think you're doing? You'll find out. Say, this one's more your size. How did we get to this? What do you think you're doing? I want your wife to watch. Leave him alone! You don't get it, Rachel, do you? I don't love you. I don't want you! You're confused. That'll pass. At least one of your brains isn't confused. - Just stop! No! - No! Stop it! In all my time as a nurse, I only ever had to do one of these. Poor bastard ripped it up next day by accident. Never seen so much blood come out of such a tiny hole. Please... No! no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Said you needed to pee, right? When you do, you're gonna fill up the tank. And the fuller it gets, the more shocking it will be. You're connected to the national grid. Whatever you decide with the buttons... I suggest you do it soon. Miss Rachel? I'm... I'm sorry, Miss Rachel. I got you some coffee. Miss Rachel? I got... I got you the painting of the glow worms, Miss Rachel. Miss Rachel? It'll keep you warm. Miss Rachel? Miss Rachel! Miss Rachel? Miss Rachel? Please! Please help me! Please help me! Like a coffee? Please... get me some help. What's your name? -Mr. Samuels. -Mr. Samuels. I need you to get me some help. Call the police. I... I'll... I'll get Rachel. -Rachel's nice. -No. -Rachel will help. -No, no. Not Rachel. -Rachel will help. -No. You must call the police. Not Rachel. You need to call the police. Rachel's nice. Rachel's nice. She will help. What are you doing here? Here's some coffee, Miss Rachel. What have I said about coming in here? I'm... I'm sorry, Miss Rachel. I was bad. Please don't punish me. -Bad boys need to be punished. -Please, leave him alone. You can see that he's not all there. I wouldn't harm him. I've got something very special planned for him. Your real mother fucked up with you, didn't she? No wonder she abandoned you. I would have. My mother loved me! She tried to protect me. Your real mother didn't give a rat's ass about you. -Shut up! -She probably wishes -you were dead. -Shut up! No! I said stop it! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I said shut up! Stop it! Shut up! I think you pissed her off. Yeah. I really hit a raw nerve, didn't I? I don't know if that's the best thing to do. I gotta try something... before that tank fills up. Andy... I have to tell you something. I'm gonna need you to hear me out before you say anything, okay? I knew about your affair... three days ago. -What? -When you were out last night... I knew you were with her. I didn't wanna believe it, but she said she had proof. -You're part of all this? -No. I didn't know about this, I swear. I would never have done this. I just wanted the truth... from you. You could have just asked me. God... All the lies... I didn't know what to believe. Please forgive me. Andy... It doesn't matter anymore anyway. You have to press the button. Please... It's the only way. I want you to save yourself. No. It's not the only way. You have to try get free. What did I do, Andy? Where did I let you down? Baby, you never did. Rachel? Are you sad? Why would I be sad? I'm getting married. I've got an idea. It's gonna hurt, but it just might work. I'm not sure I like where this is going. How high is it from your chest to the spikes? Little under a foot, I guess. Where does the catheter tube run? On the inside of my leg. Try to get the tube on top of your thigh and under the spike. Do you trust me? I'm gonna ask you a question... and I need you to lie. You're just as crazy as her. The spikes will hit you, baby. But they shouldn't go all the way through... but only drop a foot. Yee. That's real comforting. Now, answer the question. God! Do you still love me? No! Did it work? Yes, yes. What do you think of the dress, Mr. Samuels? Do you think he'll like it? Come on, don't be shy. You're about to perform a marriage ceremony. You've got yourself into quite a mess there, honey. I don't think that's gonna save you. Kill her, Andy. Just press the button and it can all be over. I even brought a priest so we can get married right away. Start the ceremony. Come on, just like I told you. - I... - Andy. Andy... Rachel. Do-do-you-take Rachel... to-to-to hold... ...to be wedded... ...and to love... Till death do you part. Honor, to-to-to-to... - Andy... - ...to love... - ...okay. - ...till death do you part? - He does. Do the next bit. ... Miss Rachel... I love you, Helen. God, no! No! Bitch! - Rachel! - No! No! No! No! No! My God! Andy! I'm so sorry! I'm here.
