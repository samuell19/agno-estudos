PART TWO The artichokes! And soupe 'Marie-Louise'! And the orange punch? It's my own invention. In our Kaluga estate, the peasants have spent everything they had on drink. Now they have nothing with which to pay us. Konstantin Dmitrievich, do explain it to us. You know everything, and you're always defending the mouzhiks. I'm sorry, I know nothing about it, so I can't say anything. We haven't seen each other for such a long time. Though I saw you once. It was one evening at sunset. For one fleeting moment you appeared in the window of a carriage. - What were you thinking about then? - I don't remember. It's a vicious circle, gentlemen. Women are deprived of rights for lack of education. Absolutely correct. The point is whether women are capable of assimilating these rights. As well as responsibilities. I think they are. Women are so special... Have you heard about Pryachnikov? He fought in a duel with Kvitsky and killed him with one bullet. Why was he dueling? Because of his wife. He challenged him and killed him. Acted like a man. You're not leaving already? Yes. I must apologize for having to leave. There's something I must speak to you about. Please, come in here. Where are you going? L'll go with you. To see a ballet. But first I have to pay a visit backstage. The main thing is to preserve the sanctity of the home. So little harm is done... and so much pleasure gained. I know... It's none of my business. But I love and respect Anna. What is wrong between you two? What has she done? She has slighted her duties and deceived her husband. Please, do anything you want with her, but not divorce. We must get out of the humiliating position in which we are placed. We can't live as a trio. And if you leave her, what'll become of her? It'll be the end of her. Have you thought about it? I have. I have thought a great deal about it. Anna and sin. It's impossible! It's inconceivable! I can't believe it! I would pay dearly for being able to harbor doubts. But is it possible to harbor doubts when a wife confesses to her husband her infidelity? When I doubted, I had hope. Now there's no hope, yet I still doubt everything. I'm in such doubt that I even hate my son. At times I even doubt if he's my son. I am very unhappy. I understand you so well! I understand you, but listen, I'd like to tell you my story. I got married and my husband deceived me. I was so angry, so jealous that I wanted to leave him. But I stopped in time. It was Anna who saved me. I am living on, the children are growing up. My husband feels his fault, and is growing purer, better. I live on. I have forgiven him. You have to forgive too. I cannot forgive. Nor do I wish to. I regard it as wrong. I did everything for her. And she has trampled it in the mud. I am not a spiteful man. I never... hated anyone. But I hate her with every single fiber of my being. I hate her so much that I can't even forgive her for all the wrong... she has done me. But Anna is very ill. Her condition is dangerous. I'm terrified when I think of what might happen. I implore you, Alexei Alexandrovich, go to her... Go to her. Kitty, wait. I... I've wanted to ask you something for a long time. You may ask me now. That day we skated together you said: 'It's impossible. ' Does that mean... I understand. Does that mean... - What is this word? - Ne-ver. Yes, never. That's not true any more. It was only true then. - Only then? - Yes. And now? Now I would say... I would like... you... to forget... Yes... and forgive... I... I... I have never... ceased... loving... you... Thank you. Yes, yes... I have never ceased loving you. Make haste! How is Madame? Safely delivered yesterday afternoon. - How is she? - Very poorly. The doctors held a consultation yesterday. Take my bags. Who is here? The doctor, the midwife and Count Vronsky. - Send to the pharmacy for morphine. - Right away, Doctor. Good morning, Your Excellency. Alexei Alexandrovich... Alexei Alexandrovich... she's going to die. The doctors say there's no hope. I'm completely at your mercy. But permit me to remain here. Though, of course, I'll do as you say... Give me some water. Oh, no. I think it's bad... for my little girl. All right, I agree. Get her a nurse. When he comes, it will hurt him to see her. He's a kind man. He doesn't realize how kind he is. Why isn't he coming? Oh God, what a torture! Take all these coats off me! Take them off, please. Has Seryozha been given his dinner? You all forget, but he wouldn't have. Anna Arkadyevna, he has arrived. Here he is. What nonsense! You say he won't forgive. You don't know him. No one knows. I alone know. No, no... I'm not afraid of you! I'm afraid... of death. Alexei... come closer to me. I must make haste. There's not much time left for me to live. Soon I'll be too sick to know anything. Wait, wait... Yes, yes, yes... That's what I wanted to tell you. I'm still the same. But there's someone else in me! I wanted to hate you but could not forget the one I had been before. She is not me. The real me is the one you see now. All of me. I'm dying now. I know I'm going to die. I only want one thing... Will you... forgive me? You must forgive me, completely. No, it's impossible! I know you can't forgive me that. No! Go away! You're too perfect. Why... Why doesn't he come? How strange that they should both be called Alexei. Yes... he has come! I knew it... Farewell now. Farewell to all. Come here! Uncover your face. Look at him! He... he's a saint. Uncover your face. Alexei Alexandrovich, do uncover his face. I want to... to see him... Shake hands with him. Forgive him, please. Thank God... Thank God. That wallpaper is so horrid! If I could only stretch my legs. Oh God! When will this all be over? Alexei Alexandrovich... I'm unable to speak, unable to... think. Please, have mercy! No matter how great your suffering is, mine is even worse. Sit down and hear me out. It's necessary. I have to explain to you my feelings, so that there will be no misunderstandings concerning me. I had decided on a divorce and started the proceedings. I admit I was beset by thoughts of revenge. When I received the telegram, I came here with the same feelings. I will say even more: I longed for her death. But then... I saw her and forgave her. I have forgiven her completely. I'm willing to turn the other cheek. I'm ready to give away my shirt since my coat has been taken. I pray to God not to deprive me of the joy of forgiveness. Such is my position. You can make me the laughing-stock of society... but I will not abandon her should God Almighty grant her life. I must remain with her, and I will. If she wishes to see you, I will notify you. At the present time, however, I believe you'd better leave. Yes, yes, of course. Of course. God's servant, Konstantin, plights his troth to God's servant, Yekaterina. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. God's servant, Yekaterina, plights her troth to God's servant, Konstantin. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. We praise Thee, most merciful God! I hereby join in holy union Konstantin and Yekaterina. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Joined in holy wedlock are thy servants, Yekaterina and Konstantin. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Almighty God, crown them with glory and with honour. He's not worth her little finger, don't you think so? - How is Count Vronsky? - How is his wound? He is recovering, and planning to go to Tashkent. Rejoice, oh Isaiah! A telegram. - Who's there? - Princess Tverskaya. One may regard one and the same thing either in a tragic or comic light. I don't know whether I'm better or worse than anyone else. If he weren't going so far away, I would have understood your own and your husband's refusal. I refuse for my own sake, not for my husband's. I beg you, let's stop talking about it. But surely you must want to say goodbye to a man who tried to take his own life for you. That's exactly why I don't want to. Let's not talk about it. I'm so glad you're at home! I haven't seen you since Anna's illness. I've heard what good care you took of her. You're an amazing husband! We've been chatting too long. I really must be going now. Wait! I must tell you... I mean, to you... I can't and I don't want to have any secrets from you. Count Vronsky is leaving for Tashkent, and he would like to say goodbye to us. I said I could not see him. You said that was for Alexei Alexandrovich to decide. No, I said that I wouldn't receive him. There would be no point in it. I just don't want to. I know you are a truly generous man. I love Anna and respect you so much that I venture to offer advice: do receive him. Vronsky is the soul of honour, and he's leaving for Tashkent... Thank you, Princess, for your sympathy and advice. But only my wife can decide whom she should or should not receive. A telegram from your brother. He's coming to Petersburg. - I haven't the time to meet him... - Yes, I know. L'll go. I agree that there's no need for Count Vronsky to come here. However, if... I've told you already. Why do I need to repeat it? Let's not talk about it anymore. I left the decision up to you, and I'm very glad to see... That my wishes coincide with your own? Yes. The Princess shouldn't meddle in others' complicated family affairs. Especially since... - But I don't blame anyone. - Yes, you do! What has she done to you? Why didn't I die? Oh, I wish I were dead! L'm sorry, I'm unstrung, but... do go away! Go away! Go away! I can't live with him anymore. I can't bear the sight of him. They say women love men even for their vices. But I hate him because he's so virtuous. You married without love, or without knowing love. That was a grave mistake. I seem to be falling down the abyss, and there's nothing left to do but... You are giving in to pessimism, you must pull yourself together. Believe me, you're exaggerating things. No, Stiva, I'm lost. L'm lost. I'm like a string stretched too tight. The string can be loosened little by little. There's always a way out of every situation. Yes, you're right! There's no sense in lying to myself any more. I'm still alive and it's not my fault. Let come what may. Anything is better than deceit. We'll go to Italy. Alone, to live like man and wife. - What is it? - Oh, nothing, really. I just wanted you to turn round. I made a wish and it worked. What were you thinking about? Just wondering how I'd cut out these little holes. What were you thinking about? Tell me. About my work. Many things... I'm so glad of the chance to be alone with you. - Are you happy? - Yes, I'm happy. But I'm dissatisfied with myself. Why? How can you be dissatisfied and happy at the same time? I want nothing for myself, but I have always envied people whose whole lives are subordinated to duty. When I compare myself to them, I see I'm not worth much. Why? Aren't you doing enough for others? With your work on the estate? With your writing? No, no. I don't do any of it as I should. I do it as though it were a lesson assigned to me. I'm pretending. And all the time I'm thinking of death. Of course, it's all nonsense, but come to think of it. Our world is just a little mould, that has grown on our tiny planet. And we imagine we can achieve great things. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so very happy I don't think I can understand anything. - Won't you be tired? - No. Stay out of the sun. We're going for a little walk. Kitty, you mustn't walk too much in your condition. Why don't you try our method with this jam? Just cover the jar with a piece of paper soaked in rum. It'll never get moldy. I'll try it. Anyhow, our way of pickling is considered the best anywhere around these parts. Verse number forty-eight. 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in Heaven is perfect. ' - I hope you understand that? - Yes, papa. Is it true that you got a new decoration? Are you glad? First, will you stop rocking? And second, what counts is work, not the reward. When you work, you must love what you do. And your work will be your reward. Yes, papa. Did you get the Alexander Nevsky order? - Is there something higher? - Vladimir. - And still higher? - Saint Andrew. And higher than that? You are far too young to be interested in these things. I've asked you to stop rocking. Now name the patriarchs who lived before the Flood. Enos... Enoch... Then Methuselah... - Jared... Enos... - You've already named Enos. It's bad that you don't try to learn the things which are the most important for a Christian. I must punish you. I'm leaving now, and you're forbidden to go for a walk as usual. The nurse said that my mama isn't really dead. Is it true? She's dead... She's dead... for you. 'I haven't seen him for such a long time. I'm so unhappy being separated from my son. I'm imploring you for permission to see him, if only just once. I'm turning to you and not to Alexei Alexandrovich, only because I do not want that generous man to suffer. Knowing of your friendship with him, I'm sure you'll understand me. Will you send Seryozha to me or should I come to the house when you tell me to?' I have received a letter from her. She is here, in Petersburg. Oh, I congratulate you! Lydia Ivanovna has taken Karenin under her special protection. The Countess has never stopped being in love with someone: a prince, the Metripolitan, now it's Karenin. He came straight from the Winter Palace where the Czar was congratulating those who've been decorated. She asks me to assist her in arranging a meeting with your son... our little angel. I do not believe that I have the right to refuse her. You never see evil in anyone. I see evil everywhere, but would it be fair? There is a limit to everything. And if you ask my advice... I'd advise you not to do it. Without any hesitation I wouldn't advise it. With your permission... I'll answer her letter. All we may do is pray to Almighty God to have mercy on her. Madame? I want to see Seryozha... Sergey Alexeyevich. Let me take a look. He's waking up. Madame is here? Seryozha! It's me. Come here. Mama! Seryozha, my darling! Today is my birthday. I knew you'd come. Mama, why are you crying? I won't cry. I'm crying forjoy. I haven't seen you for such a long time. Now, you must get dressed. Yes. Only I don't wash with cold water. Papa said not to. You're sitting on my clothes. My darling, you didn't believe I was dead? I never believed it, mama darling! Don't go away, he's not coming yet. My darling! My blessed little monkey! You won't forget me? Don't go. He won't come. My baby, love your father. I did him a terrible wrong. When you're older, you'll understand. He's kinder than I am, and better. No! I don't want to! Mama! Darling mama! No one is better than you! Mama! Mama! You know how fond I am of Anna. Don't think I'm condemning her. But she simply doesn't understand her situation. I cannot receive her. I can't change the world. I know she won't be received in court circles. But our close friends, they can and they must understand. She might meet people in my house who take a different view of things. You'll be snubbed by them. No, as long as her situation remains... irregular... I simply cannot receive her. Don't be angry with me. I see... Please understand it's not my fault. But I'm pained all the more because this ends our friendship, too. You will understand that for me there can be no other way. Are you really going to the theatre? Why shouldn't I? I've wanted to hear Patti for so long. Why do you ask in such a frightened tone? After all, there isn't any reason not to go... I'm not going alone. Yashvin won't be a compromising escort. Anna, what's wrong with you? - What do you mean? - You know you can't go. Why? You're busy. You can stay at home. - Don't you realize that... - No! And I don't want to! - But you must understand... - I don't care to! For us, only one thing counts: whether we love each other or not. There can be no other consideration. Why can't I go to the theatre? I love you and there's nothing else that matters. Why aren't you looking at me? You know my feelings for you will never change. But I'm begging you not to go. And I beg you to give me one good reason why I should not. Alyosha! Why do you come so late? What a shame! Madame Kartasova had no right... - What did she do? - She insulted Madame Karenina. Go on, Maman is waiting. No one can ever see you anymore. Madame Karenina is creating a sensation. So much so they're forgetting Patti. - I asked you not to speak in this... - I only say what everyone's saying. I'm so glad you're going to meet her. Even though she's my sister, I can say outright that she's... a remarkable woman. You'll see for yourself. Her position in society is horrid! Her situation's hell. And there's no hope of its changing. - Why? - It's a long and boring story. First her husband, then she, refused the divorce. Now they live in the country. Another woman would have lost courage long ago, but she... You'll see how she's organized her life, how calm she is. She has a daughter. She must be quite busy with her. You think every woman is just another brood hen, don't you? If a woman is busy at all, it can only be with children. - Give us some work, sir. - No, I have nothing for you. - Where do you come from? - From far away. - Why did you come here? - In search of work. No, we don't have anything. Only enough for our own peasants. - Well, God bless you. - Goodbye, sir. Hard as their work is, they haven't enough of it. I admit there's much injustice in the world. Yes, it's true, I do feel it but... You won't give up what is yours to them. How can I do that? But you're convinced that it is unjust. I always feel the injustice of my being so much richer than them. But I have my responsibilities to the land, to my family, and to society as well. You see? And I think you must either admit that the existing order is just and defend your rights, or acknowledge that you're enjoying unjust privileges, and then take pleasure in them. I cannot enjoy them when I see how poor my people are, and know that it's unjust. Well, then, don't enjoy them. I feel I've long known and loved you because of your friendship with Stiva and because of your lovely wife. But if she can't forgive me my situation, I hope she would never be able to forgive me. To forgive, one must go through it... I'm not trying to prove something. I only want to live and not harm anyone... excepting me. I have a right to that, haven't I? Once a peasant told me: 'All people are different. One lives solely for his needs, another for the salvation of his soul. He remembers the Lord. ' To live not for what attracts you, but for a God that no one can understand or define. Do you think I'm living? L'm not. Alexei can go wherever and whenever he likes. He has every right, I have none. A great many couples stay for years in the same old rut that is hated by both husband and wife simply because there's neither strife nor happiness between them. For me to be happy, I must have with me both my son and Alexei. I love both of them equally, and both more than myself. If I can't have them both, then nothing matters. Nothing matters. That's the eternal mistake of imagining happiness as a fulfilled desire. And what if all we have to look forward to is suffering, doubt and endless dissatisfaction with oneself? One cannot live then. One must eitherjustify his life to himself or... A number of times I have been close to suicide. I hid the rope, so I wouldn't hang myself. I was afraid of carrying a gun about lest I should shoot myself. I am saved from despair by love alone. Do I regret anything? No. If I had to live my life over, I'd do the same thing, because I love and I'm loved... No. To live... to live! You fell in love with that vile woman! She has bewitched you, I see it in your eyes. I shall die... Why did you marry me? Why? You would be free now. Go away! Kitty, I beg of you... Stop it... Kitty, please... At what time? - You're going away? - Yes. - Today? - Yes. L'm going to Kashin. We have to elect The Marshal of the Nobility. - I hope you won't feel lonely. - I hope I won't. I received a box of books from Gautier's. - Will you be gone long? - A few days. Oh, no... I'll have to take a trip to Moscow. Well, if you have to go to Moscow, I'll come too. - L'm only going for a few days. - L'll go for a few days too. I won't stay here all alone. Either we should separate or we should live together. I'd like to be with you always, but I have obligations towards my friends, towards society. I understand. But I shall go to Moscow too. That sounds like a threat. Let's not talk about it anymore. - Why not? - I must have some occupation! Socially you have already got far too many occupations. You're a member of six public bodies: you're a counselor, a juryman... You've got so many obligations that it looks like a farce. Why are you so irritable, Anna? No... I can't live like that! You've grown tired of me, I'm a burden to you. You must not despair. Your sorrow is great, but you must find consolation. I am crushed, annihilated. I am no longer a man. I cannot find the strength to support me. Christ's love is our support. - I am weak. I am crushed. - My dear friend... I foresaw nothing and now I understand nothing. It's not the loss I have sustained. I have no regrets. But the humiliation I suffer before people because of my situation. It is wrong, but I cannot help it. Ask Him to help you. Only in Him we will find comfort, deliverance and love. And now for practical matters. Such things are not my strong point, but I will be your housekeeper. And now I'm going to tell Seryozha that his father is a saint. And how is your poor sister? Give her my love. She was so right in leaving that half-wit husband of hers. Everyone claimed he's such a clever man. I'm the only one who said he's a fool. That one was close! And now that he got mixed up with that stupid Lydia Ivanovna and that dimwit Landau, everybody realizes how right I was. This one'll be a miss. I've never heard of him. We don't know about him in Moscow. You haven't heard of Jules Landau? It's because you live in the province. Just another insane man. Lydia Ivanovna brought him to Petersburg from Paris. - He is treating her husband. - With no success. Yesterday I asked Karenin to give me an answer on behalf of my sister. Instead I got an invitation from Lydia Ivanovna. You will meet Jules Landau there. Now your sister's fate depends on that Landau. Is it true that Monsieur Landau has cured Countess Bezukhov? Completely. - Is he going to Paris? - Yes, he heard a voice. - What did he hear? - A voice. Oh, a voice... I observe that Moscow people, particularly men, are utterly indifferent to religion. As I can see, you, unfortunately, are one of the indifferent ones. Have you read 'Happy Because Safe From Harm'? No. Give me your word that you will read it. It points the way to faith and the happiness that faith brings. He is asleep. Give him your hand, my friend, and you will see, you will hear... What did he say? I couldn't make it out. Come back at 10 o'clock. Or even better, tomorrow. Oh, did he speak of me? Do not admit anyone. Countess, Alexei Alexandrovich wanted to inform me of his decision about divorcing my sister. The answer is quite clear. He heard a voice. - What did he hear? - A voice. Ah, yes, a voice! Help me, Almighty Father... - Did you have a good time? - Same as usual. Wasn't it interesting? Who was there? The usual Moscow set... The Kourakins, Maman and Princess Sorokin... The girl your mother was so anxious to have you marry? Oh, that's good! When do you want to leave for Moscow? I shan't be ready by tomorrow. The day after. No... the day after tomorrow I've got to go to Maman's. Couldn't you go there tomorrow? The money I'm going for won't be ready by tomorrow. If that's how it is, we shan't go at all. - Why not? - L'm not going later than Monday. It's Monday or never! But why? It makes no sense. Because you don't care about me! You can't understand what my life is like. But there are necessities with which we must comply. You always boast of your uprightness, so why don't you tell the truth? You should know I never have boasted. And I always tell the truth. I wish you could learn to respect... Respect... respect... Respect was invented to cover up the empty space left by the absence of love. Actually, if you no longer love me, it would be more honest to say so. Oh! It's getting intolerable! Why do you try my patience? It has limits! What do you mean by that? I don't understand what you mean by that. I mean to say... What do you want of me, exactly? Tell me. What do I want? What can I want? Only that you should not desert me as you wish to do. I want love, and there is none. So then... it's over? It's finished! Oh, there's a limit to a man's endurance! Wait! Has Madame finished her dinner? Anna, we'll leave the day after tomorrow, if you want. Leave me! Who am I? I am a depraved woman. I'll go tomorrow. L'll give you your freedom. I don't want to torment you. You don't love me! You love someone else! Anna, why do you torture me and torture yourself? If you only knew how desperate I feel! I'm so afraid... I'm afraid of myself! What must I do to make you happy? Good morning. It's from Stiva... about the divorce. He hasn't been able to get a reply from Alexei Alexandrovich. There's little hope, but he'll do whatever he can. I wish you cared as little about it as I do. This interests me because I like things to be definite. It's not form but love that makes things definite. Why do you want it so much? I'm certain that your irritability comes largely from the indefiniteness of our situation. That's not the reason. I'm entirely at your mercy. There's nothing indefinite about it. On the contrary. The indefiniteness consists in your assuming I'm free. Oh, don't let that worry you. Let me reassure you. I'm not interested in what marriage your mother may be plotting for you. - But that's beside the point! - That's exactly the point! Anyone who is heartless, whether she's your mother or a stranger, doesn't deserve my attention. Anna, I ask you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother. A woman who can't feel in her heart where the happiness of her son may lie, has no heart. I ask you once more not to speak so of my mother whom I respect. You don't love your mother! It's only words! - So we're definitely going tomorrow? - You are. I am not. Anna, we can't go on living like this. You'll regret this, believe me. Anna! I had to make up my mind. I know what to do! I am so glad to see you. I should not have been surprised if you refused to see me. I am accustomed to it. I came to say goodbye. Are you going away? I've heard so much about you, from your husband too. He paid me a visit. I liked him very much. - Where is he? - He... he's gone to the country. I liked him immensely. Be sure to remember me to him. Of course. Why all these churches? These bells? These lies? Only to hide the fact that we hate each other. My love grows more passionate and egoistic, while his is waning and that can't be helped. I don't know these streets. So many houses... So many people in them... No end of them, and everyone hating everyone else. Aren't we all thrown into this world only to hate each other, and then torture each other? No, no, it can't go on. We are growing apart. I make him unhappy, he makes me unhappy. Nothing but lies and falsehood... All is deceit, all... evil...
