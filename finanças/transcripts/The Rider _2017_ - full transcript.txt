Told you to check me out. Well, doctor said you're supposed to stay up there. Give me a hug. Why don't you go inside and sober up? Sober up? Let me see you rope that. Checking yourself out of the hospital like your Uncle Roddy? What the hell? Can't you rope anymore? Got any chew? Just give me a hug. Love you. ANNOUNCER". Ladies and gentlemen, how about another round of applause? You get a little bit out of time, and that's all it takes to put you down on the ground. Next in the livestock bucking chute, here's Brady Jandreau. (CROWD CHEERING) ANNOUNCER". Bucking chute. Here comes Brady. WOMAN: Go, Brady. Go, Brady! (ANNOUNCER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (VIDEO STOPS) WOMAN: Go, Brady! ANNOUNCER: Well, folks, it's... Our rear pickup can't get a hold of that horse. The cowboy... (MICROWAVE BEEPS) Hmm. WAYNE: There's supper. Better have a bite of that chuckwagon. Just look at it for a second. Mmm-mmm. I'm sick of it. It makes me all mad. - WAYNE: I'll make a deal with you. -Hmm? A bite of the chuckwagon or wear a bra. But I don't like that bra ever! WAYNE: Brady, get her that bra. You shouldn't try to force her to eat things she doesn't want to eat. But I just want to eat fruit or not or respect about your favorite thing to do or not. You're as stubborn as your brother. Look how he ended up. - LILLY: That's dirty. -Big old gash on the side of his head. I told him not to go over there and ride that son of a bitch anyway. Well, I would have won the rodeo if I would've got her rode. LILLY: Excuse me, guys. Whole point of it is, is I told you to stay home. I had a bad feeling the whole time. (SPITS) (HORSE WHINNYING) FRANK: You got him backing up pretty good? BRADY: How you doing, Frank? HeyÂ» Brady- HOW you doing? Shit, I'm healing up. - It looks pretty wicked there. -Yeah. I'll be good to go before long. Bullshit. Don't let him lie to you, Frank. Fuck that. I'll come and see you, Frank. Don't worry about it. You should lay off that horse's face a little bit, and he wouldn't be putting his head in there like a goose. Well, you can tell me what to do when you're riding the son of a bitch. Too bad you went to the rodeo and got all fucked up and you ain't showing him. BRADY: I was doing what I needed to do. Well, I'm doing what I need to do. Finishing something that you should be doing. Well, see you, Brady. Take care. (TINKLING) I was tough, Mom. (cousmws) (COUGHS) (DOOR OPENS) LILLY: What's the matter, Brady? Sit down, Lilly. - You okay? -Sure. - Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. All right. You won't get hurt yourself. I didn't mean to. Aw, it's okay. Come here. - Listen. -What? This time, you don't... Your hurt boo-boo? - Yeah. -I... That... This is a head. - Yeah. -it's called "skull." Yeah, I hurt my skull. - You know what they had to do? -What? They had to do surgery. Surgery? Don't joke me. You know what they do when they do surgery? - What? -What do they do? - Got broke. -Yeah. I broke it. Broke my skull. Yeah, "broke my skull," right. And then you have to cut it with a knife. Uh-huh. - Cut it. -Yeah. - And then they put a plate in there. -Uh-huh. And then they sewed it up. (STAMMERS) But you said... -"Not gonna, either"? -Not gonna what? Bucking horse anymore. Uh, maybe. Oh, dear, that's terrible. I'm not gonna die. - No, I'm not gonna die, either. -No. - I'm staying alive. -Yeah. Lil, can you sing me a song so I can take a nap? - Yes. -Okay. (SINGING IN SPANISH) (CHUCKLES) (DOOR OPENS) Holy piss. Jesus Christ, he looks like Frankenstein. That's fucking right. Fuck that. That's just a scratch. (LAUGHS) Some smoke will help it. (IE-Lows) Get the fuck out of here. (GUYS LAUGHING) You can wrap it up, right? BRADY: Why? What are you guys doing? Put your Wranglers on, man. - Yeah, let's go get fucked up, bud. -Let's go. CAT: Last of the Mohics. (ALL LAUGH) (DISTANT CHATTER) Yeah! (WHOOPING) Your turn, James. Do it. Yea! Yeah! Fuck yeah, dude. (STRUMMING GUITAR) Come on, Brady! Let's go! Come on, Brady! - Brades, come on! -Yeah. (WHOOPS) That horse I got on in Fargo was... Everything I heard about her was shit, but I got on her and said, "Fuck it," and... She was good out there for a while, and... Until the whistle, she got real trashy and started turning there by the fence, sucking back, and I went over the front of her. She stepped on my head, popped me out. Didn't knock me out until they got me back to the hospital there. I had a seizure and went into a coma. CAT: Yeah, I been going for 10-plus years, you know? Probably had 10-plus concussions. I probably should... I mean, by NFL standards, I should be dead, you know what I mean? Got kicked in Kadoka at Rodeo Bible Camp. Went out the back door. That wasn't so bad. It was kind of a stinger there for about a week, but... Started riding and it loosened up a little more. TANNER: Got on this big, gray mare. I was getting pretty stretched out towards the end, and thank God I heard the whistle blow. But, anyway, right at the end, she slammed me down in the dirt. Hardest I've ever been slammed before. Brady over there told me to get on my short-go horse even though my ribs hurt like a son of a bitch. Ain't that right, Brady? You don't let no pain put you down. You ain't gonna be turning out horses left and right just 'cause your head hurts a little bit now, are you? I'm not... I'm not drawing out of anything. I'm just taking some time off. Your brain's a little different than your ribs. Yeah, I know, but it's all the same to a cowboy. Ride through the pain. You gotta make sure this head of yours don't get you scared. I know how that goes with some guys. They get scared to get on again, and then they end up becoming farmers. Hey, Brady. You seen Lane? Well, I didn't get a chance to see him there for a while, while I was rodeoing. They just checked him into a brand-new rehab facility. He probably could have won the World if he'd had an honest chance. Remember when he went three forthree in McCool Junction and won it? Yeah, that was a good night for Lane. Remember when he broke his riding arm and won the bull riding first time ever riding a bull with his right hand? Eighty-four points. Shit, one time, me and Lane was coming back from a party. We was driving 'm Tanner's brother's car, and we was kind of talking about women. We was a little drunk, and Lane looks over at me and says, "James, you know what? One thing I've learned in life," he says... (CLEARS THROAT) "I've always thought girls come in with a name "and they leave with a number." (ALL LAUGHING) It's kind of fucked up, but... - Dirty dog. -Yeah. Lane. Yeah. Real wild. CAT: Want to say a prayer for him. I mean, be best if we say a prayer every day, you know... Yeah. For the guy, 'cause he sure could use it. But I just want to go ahead and say... Pray to God that he takes in all the strength from all his friends across the nation. North, south, east and west. 'Cause we all know he's got friends all over this country. Pulls through. Hope he gets to ride again. Feel the wind hit his back and watch it flow through the grass. We are him, and he is us. We're all one in this together.

Not trying to imply anything, but me and Superman have never been seen in the same room together, so... (HEAVY METAL PLAYING ON VIDEO) MAN: No shirt. Wild man. (WHOOPING) MAN". Nice, baby! Good ride, cowboy! I was about three years old when my dad introduced me into the rodeo world. There's nothing that really can beat it. You get on a bull, make a good ride, everybody... Everybody in the stands stands up for you, yells, cheers. Um... Your adrenaline's going, you... You just can't stop but smiling. There's nothing like strapping yourself onto a 2,000 pound animal and just going with it. That's what I wanted to do, and I knew I wanted to do it for the rest of my life. I couldn't imagine doing anything else. (SINGING) Somebody come and play Somebody come and play my way Somebody come and rhyme the rhymes... - Lil. -What? Thinking about going to the rodeo. If I do, you want to go with? Nope. Nope. Take you to the carnival afterwards. - Carnival? -Get on some rides. Are you sure? - If you want to. -Yes. Somebody come and play today... All right.

You know, and be mad about it. I don't know, she'sjust not like that anymore. She's got all these new things that she does and likes, and saying... She's growing up so fast. You get to be around more. No more rodeo for you. -(KNOCKING AT DOOR) -(GIGGLES) Here I go! Hey, Miles. How's it going, guys? MILES: I'm looking for your dad. He owes me some money on this trailer. Need payment. Otherwise, I'm gonna come and get it. He went to the horse sale in Corsica yesterday, and I haven't seen him since he left, but... Yeah, it's been four months since I got any money from him. I need some. I'm tired of looking for his ass. Okay. I'll be sure to let him know. MILES: Yeah, he needs to come and find me. I'm done. I like your tattoos. - WOMAN: Do you have a resume? -No. Any job experience? I'm a horse trainer. You can't do that right now? Um... Well, I would, but I can't ride for a while since I'm laid up, so... Any high school? GED? No, ma'am. The OST TERO office, they have job training for, like, construction, road work. I'm looking for something a little more temporary than that. You know, I'm probably gonna be training horses again here in a few months when I'm healed up, so... My cousin's a manager at Dakotamart.

You want 'em to haul the trailer away? You want Lilly to not have a place to live? Gus is part of the family. I guess it's his turn for us to make a living. Well, where's all your money going? It costs a lot to live. Well, maybe you should've thought about that when you were putting money in the slot machines, going to the fucking bars and casinos. That's where all the money went. Fuck you, Brady. I don't need to hear your shit. It's not like you can fucking ride anymore. What are you gonna do? Fight me? I don't need your shit.

(WHISTLES) -(GUNSHOT) -(BODY mums) (SPITS) BRADY". You know, Lilly, Apollo got hurt, and we had to put him down. Nope. Nuh-uh. BRADY: It's not fair to the horse. He can't run and play and do what he wants to do. She doesn't go on. You know, I got hurt like Apollo did. But I'm a person, so I got to live. If any animal around here got hurt like I did, they'd have to be put down. You know, Lilly, I believe God gives each of us a purpose. Very true. To the horse, it's to run across the prairie. For a cowboy, it's to ride. WAYNE: Where are you going with that? Where does it look like I'm going? I'm going to the rodeo. You fucking crazy? I'm gonna ride. I figured you were coming to watch. WAYNE: What the fuck would I wanna come for? Watch you kill yourself? You're-just stubborn as hell. You won't listen to nothing anybody tells you anyway. Oh, I don't listen? I always fucking listened. I listened to everything you fucking said to me. What happened to "Cowboy up," "Grit your teeth," "Be a man"? What happened to all that, Dad? You don't need to go ride today. - You don't need to fucking go ride. -Bullshit. I'm going. I'm entered, and I'm riding. Go kill yourself, then. I'm not gonna end up like you.

(MUSIC PLAYING) Well, I'm an outlaw Running from the storm From the Tennessee Hills to the New Mexico summers I've got nothing but my name and my pistol by my side Just spin around Just spin around I ride at night 'cause I sleep all day The only way I live is the outlaw way Got my horse packed up and my pistol's loaded If you wanna doubt me, boy I'll show you Say click, click, boom, like Jesse James Shoot you down, but there ain't no shame Leave you there lying with nothing but your name Playing Russian roulette This ain't no game On every wanted poster from here to the Sun Got myself, I don't need no one All I need is my horse and my gun Down by the fire I live on the run Don't count on me waiting for the sunrise I'll be gone with the moon to free my mind Rolling like a sage pushin' wind Here I go again If that sheriff ever runs me down I'll just move along to another town But I... I just can't say where or when Here I go again I'm an outlaw Running from the storm
