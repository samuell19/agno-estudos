(arrows whooshing) (upbeat music) (gunshots) (upbeat music continues) -Can I get a whiskey sour? -Can you make a shoe smell? -Oh, yeah. -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Robert. -Henry? -No, get out of my store. -I can help you. -Yeah, you told me this months ago. -I just need time. -Now just leave. -He's not doing business with you, Robert. -Henry? -It's over, Robert. -So you turned on me too, huh? (loud crash) -Hey babes, come sit at the bar with me. (tires squealing) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (gunshot) (gunshot) -Come on. Go. (gunshots) -We need to get out of here! Go pack a bag! (dramatic music) (police sirens blaring) -Robert. Come on out peaceful, so no one gets hurt. One more time, then we'll go in. Robert! -This jackass is trying to bang my wife. -That's it. -Sit down. -Stop it! Free round of drinks on the house? Shit. Serve these for me and watch the bar. It's my mom. -Hey, TomTom, it's Ben. -Yes. -I'm not good at these things, so I'm just going to come right out and tell you. -Yeah. -It's your parents. Your mom. Your mom and dad are gone Tomi. Your mom shot your dad and then herself. -What? -I know. I know. Listen. Did your mom and dad say anything to you about what was happening? -No. What? -Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry, Tomi. So sorry. Listen, you need to come home and take care of things. -Okay? -How long of a drive do you have? -6 hours. -Okay. Okay. Again, I'm, I'm so, so sorry and and I'm here for you when you get home TomTom. -Thanks. (crying) -Be careful, bye, bye. (somber music) (car door closes) (somber music) (cans rattling) -You're a knotch off the ole stock. -Papa, why do I need to know how to shoot a gun? -Protection. -From who? -The government, scoundrels. -Huh? -You'll understand one day. -Okay Papa. -Tomi, there's nothing in this world you can't do. Never think small. Think big, okay? (somber music) (dramatic music) (gunshots) (sighing) (sighing) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (knocking) -Yes, Miss Fletcher, be there in a minute. -Oh baby. Sweet Jesus. Child, it is good to see you. -It's good to see you, Miss Fletcher. -So you're moving back in? -For the moment. -That's good. That's good. We didn't like seeing the house abandoned. I am so sorry. Here, I brought you some of my world famous bread pudding. -Thank you. -Oh, baby. I know, I know. It's like your connection to the earth has been severed. Just know that, Henry and I are right next door if you need anything. -How is Mr. Henry? -Bless your heart, he's fine. I told that old fool I hoped you were moving in. And you know what he said? You're not going to believe it, he says, you mean that little girl? I swear ya'll grow so fast. -I've heard that. -When you get older, time just flies by child. -Does it? -You need to get out soon and see the town. You plan on going out? -I've been thinking about it. May downtown later. -Oh, Lord. Let me get out of your hair then. And you make sure and try that bread pudding. That was my best ever. And if you need anything, honey, just let us know and feel free to come to the house anytime. And eat that bread pudding, baby. -I sure will. Thanks. -Hey, have you been in the barn? You might want to try that out. Bye, bye now. -You're tin now? (door closes) Holy shit. What the hell were you doing, dad? (door opens) (gun cocks) (suspenseful music) (intense music) Let me go! -Where is it? -Where's what? -Where is it? -Where's what?! -Your time's coming. (gunshots) (intense music) (upbeat music) (water softly splashing) (dramatic music) -Hello? Anyone in here? I have a gun. I'll shoot your ass. (intense music) What the? Something new here everyday. -Not now, what? I got money, shit. I'll tell 'em to fuck off. I'm comin' down there. (screams) (man yells) - Cody! You scared the shit out of me. -Yeah. You scared the shit in to me. Yeah. -What are you doing taking a shit here? -It's good to see you too. You brat. You just about gave me a heart attack. Where's your daddy, anyway? Went up to the house, nobody's up there. I mean, I got a key round back, but I wasn't sure. -You don't know? -Know what? -Cody, Mom shot Dad and then herself. -Oh. Oh. No way. No way. -Cody! Cody! (engine revving) What's going on around here? (upbeat music) - [Radio] And you're hanging with old Rockin Randola on Lake Arthur's KJLA 103.5. Hey, hope everyone's feeling fine on this beautiful fall day. We've got clear skies and a nice cool 80 degrees. KJLA 103.5. (upbeat music) -Tomi Shaw, you're a woman now. -You still have a crush on me? -Whoo Wee! You're a knockout! -Thank you. -Whatever you want. It's on the house. -Thanks, but, that may not be a good idea for me right now. -Maybe a good idea for me. -Hah, you wish. A Moscow Mule and give it a kick. -I'm sorry to hear about your parents. -I appreciate that. Has, uh, Cody come in here today. -He back? No, I haven't seen him. -Back from where? He didn't know anything about my parents. -Oh, you know, Cody, that guy's a drunk flake. He disappears all the time. (glass slams) Hey. Hey. You better pay for that. Hey, you drunk bitch! -Is that Penelope Toupe? -Yeah. -Damn. -Yeah,but she likes to work my last nerve. -Yeah, I got one of those back in the bar at school. -What are you studying back there, anyway? -Nothing. I'm done. -You're done? You gonna move back here? -I don't know yet. How's the town since fishing dried up? -Yeah, people are doing well here. Finding ways to make money with the crawfish and the rice and oil fields. -It's good to hear. -Where are you going? -Home. I have a ton of stuff to go through. -Anything interesting? -I'll see you later. -Let's grab a drink later. -Yeah, sure. -Be great to catch up. -I'll see you later. -See you later. (intense music) -Cody. (mysterious music) Uncle Ben. -Oh, hey, TomTom. I'm sorry I didn't get much time to visit with you at the funeral. -There was a lot going on. -Yeah. I wanted to come by and offer any kind of help I can at this time or any time. -Thank you. -Came as a shock to a lot of people. -But not to you? -Well, he stopped talking to me at some point in the past couple of years, so I don't know what he was doing. Word on the street said he wasn't fishing anymore. -You're thinking something illegal. -I hate to say. The town has been going through hard times, and he seemed to thrive. -You seem to be doing all right. -I took a risk. It worked out. So have you seen the succession yet? -No. Tomorrow. -Oh. Did he leave you any kind of notes, emails, texts, anything? -A couple sentences on the fridge whiteboard. -Like? -Uh, green, deep and four acres, and something about the house being iron. -Huh. (phone ringing) -Sorry. -No, no. I'll leave you to it. Are you planning on sticking around? -I don't know yet. -Well, you need to get your dad's crawfish traps up. Be a lot of dead loss. -I'll get Cody on that. -Did you ever find Cody? -No. -Well, tell him come by and see me when you do. -Okay. -If you ever need anything. -I appreciate it. (phone ringing) Miles, so soon? -Hey, I have to work nights next week, so tonight it is. You in? (scoffs) Oh, here we go. What's the excuse? -I have a meeting in the morning. -How early? -10:00. -10 o'clock, come on, that's not early. Meet me at the bar for seven. -Okay. -Hey, well all right. Bye. -Bye. (upbeat music) (door slams) (intense music) (footsteps) -You're early. -Yeah, I got bored home alone, so I thought that I would come grab a drink before we, whatever we're going to do. -You look beautiful. -Thank you, Uncle Ben. -You know, that was something you called me as a child. It's just Ben now that we're adults. -Okay. Sorry. -And don't be sorry. Hey, give me a hug. You two kids have fun tonight. Drinks are on me. -You want to get out of here? -Yeah, you've no idea. -Ben, we good? -Oh, thank you. -Yeah. Stole this from the bar. That way it tastes better. -I bet charm is your superpower. -It doesn't hurt for sure. -Thank you. You know these aren't wine glasses, right? -You grab what you can when people aren't looking right? -Right. That's good stuff. -As good as a small town offers. -I have to say. What is going on in this town? -Whoa. -I mean, I just. People are treating me really strange. -Well, you've been gone a long time and situation with your-- -My parents. I just. I don't get that. -After the fishing dried up, people had to do whatever they could to survive here. -What do they do? What did my dad do? Nobody seems to know anything. -Well he fished, didn't he? -You just said it dried up. -Crawfish. Try to relax. Here, have a sip. -Hit me. -Did your mom or dad leave any notes or information for you? -No. This wine is a, strong. I haven't found anything yet. -Wow. It's a beautiful night. When I come out here, it frees my mind to think of all the vast things I'm going to do with my life. -You know? -Yeah. Crawfish. I'm going to introduce Louisiana crawfish to the rest of America. -Right. -Crawfish shops everywhere. We ship them out live and keep them fresh until we boil. -Do you have a name yet? -Yes. Glad you asked. -Miles and Miles Crawfish. (laughing) -I like it. -Thank you. -It's clever. -You have any idea what you're going to do when you settle things here? -Depends on how my parents left things. Do you know what Ben is doing, nowadays? -Uh, he's in the oil field game, leasing land and controlling the waterways. -Controlling the waterways? What? What does that mean? -You know, boats and shit. -Does he own LA Bar now? -Yeah. Bought from Mr. Stanley's family right after he passed. -Mr. Stanley's dead? -Yeah. -How? -Drowned fishing. -Damn. -Why don't you show me that barn of yours? It's getting late. I got to get you home anyway. -I'm a-- I'm-- I'm starting to feel a little tipsy. -You're a light weight. Oh, God. (intense music) I don't know, how do you feel? Oh, everything looks cool to me. You know, I've been to your house a few times, and I used to meet with your daddy. But, you know, I haven't been (indistinct). I would drink another one with you. Hey, look, look at me. (indistinct) (indistinct) I don't know. I'm not saying that was an expensive bottle, but. (intense music) (door creaking) (no dialogue) Okay. Where's the money? No, this isn't fucking funny, man. This is serious. Where's the money, Tomi? Hey, where's the money, man? Where's the money, Tomi?! (intense music) (birds chirping) (sighing) -What the hell is going on? (police sirens blaring) (vehicle doors closing) -Eddie? Need you to come with me. (punch thuds) Get him! (dramatic music) -Welcome, Eddie. -I know why I'm here. -Do you now? Why? -Because I know too much. -What do you know? -All of it. -You're not from here, Eddie so you probably don't know that I love this town. And I'm doing all I can to preserve it. To save it from the backwards coon asses that are stuck in the past. Tradition this, our culture that. There's no money in the past. -I don't have to be from here Culo to see you're trying to drain the town of all the oil money. (speaking Spanish) Oh, that's right. You don't understand Spanish. And I'm just some dumb Mexican that knows two languages. That's what you're thinking. -You don't know what I'm thinking. -It's all over your face pendejo. Wasn't enough that you dammed up the fishing routes, but anyone that opposes you, lost everything. Everyone knows Robert was the one-- -Don't say his name again! He's gone. He chose his path. -(speaking Spanish) Jealous of Robert. -Everybody has a choice, Eddie. You had a choice not to help him. A choice not to go behind my back to his supplier. -I had no choice! None. (intense music) -What's your choice now? -I am done. I ain't working for you. (music intensifies) -Dump him in the water. Since that was his choice to begin with. (intense music) -I am so sorry. -Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come in. Come in. Please have a seat. That's no problem. It's good to see you. As to the succession pertaining to your mother and father. And I'm very sorry about that. But as it pertains to them, the land and the farm are both paid in full. You are the sole beneficiary of both. So the good news is that you will be retaining the family land and farm. -Is there bad news? -Well, no, there's no bad news. You know, I think it's odd. For instance, all right, there are three bank accounts or there were, there were three bank accounts. One of them was closed two days before the incident. -That is weird. -That is a little weird right? The second one has $250 in it. The third one has like 1700. And that's, I mean, that's normal in a lot of ways. But these folks were approaching retirement age and you would expect them to have more money in it. You would expect them to have an I.R.A., that sort of thing. But it seems like there was just enough money put in there each month to pay the bills. -Really? -Yeah. So, I mean, it seems odd to me but maybe I'm just being paranoid, which is what they pay me for. Speaking of which, here are the documents. The paperwork from the bank, the certificates of death for your mother and father. And again, I'm very sorry about that. The deeds which we will sign over to you whenever you're ready. And that's basically it. -How much do I owe you? -You don't owe us anything. -Why? -That's been taken care of. -By who? -By Mr. Ben. -I'll make sure to thank him. -Okay. -Thank you. -Sure. Have a great day. (door opens and closes) -The dock. (door opens and closes) (dramatic music) Cody? Cody? Get Out! -Uh! Oh. -What are you doing on my dad's boat? -Your dad's boat? Hell, these are all his boats. -Tell me what's going on. -First of all, put that thing away, alright. Okay, I'm on your side here. -My side? -First of all, we got to get up on out of here, alright. (dramatic music) -Go. -It's-- Uh. -Continue. -All right, look, I'll tell you everything I know, but I've been gone for a week. -Where? -Open water. -From the beginning. -Just, all right. Look my, all right, about five years ago, Uncle Ben, he made this deal with the Land Corporation, these oil tycoons. The land people would lease the land to the oil people, who then built these dams and levees which, which land locked all the fishing ground and kept all people out. -Uncle Ben? -Wait, well then the town started dying. Everybody started getting desperate trying to figure out how to survive and figure something else out. Your dad, hell he asked Uncle Ben to open the water. But he wouldn't, wouldn't budge. So then people started losing their homes, their rice fields, and Uncle Ben he just kept getting richer and richer. -Okay. -When your daddy went down to Mexico to see about possibly moving the crawfish down there, he, he met this guy named Cidd. -The bartender at the bar? -No, hell no. No, he's the head of that Mexican group. -No, he was serving drinks. -He likes to play bartender. -Go on. -Yeah, anyway, Cidd, he uh, talked your daddy into running drugs for his cartel. -Get the hell out of here with that. -Yes, I'm telling the truth. It's true. He, look, it's just grass, but, and he was planning on quitting once the town got back on its feet. I mean, hell, he's going around giving money to everybody around town. -It's a little hard to believe that my dad-- -You know that I love your family. I love your mom and dad. I've known you since you were a little baby. -You need to understand, this is a bit overwhelming for me at the moment. -Which is why he didn't say anything to you. He was trying to protect you. -You believe that my mom did it? -No, hell, no. -I don't either. -As far as I could tell, Ben was really jealous of your daddy. He had a lot more respect in him and Ben hated that. Plus, he saw all the money he'd have us bringing around town. -You think Uncle Ben killed them? -He didn't pull the trigger, but I'd bet my life that he's the one who ordered it. Why do you think I left? I ran, I mean, he knows I'm loyal to your family. I'm next. I know way too much. -So now Uncle Ben is going to take over the drug running company and keep all the money. -If Cidd was at the bar then, yeah. -Who is your red bandana man? -Yeah, you know, he don't care about nobody. -Are the police in on it? -Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I mean, they was loyal to your dad until he was gone. But now they just jumped ship. -No, doubt. He probably helped Ben cover it up. The other night, I saw the Fletchers at the bar. -Them too. -Miles? -Oh, yeah, he's deep in, way in. Hell, everybody in the town is. They all scared to lose everything. They're all scared of Uncle Ben. Ain't no place around here safe. -Not even here. -Nowhere. -Cody, can I trust you? -Men, they got one thing that can't be taken away from him, and that's his word. You got mine. -Come see, come on. Hmm. -Riddles? -I guess. Why would they still have the crawfish traps out? -I don't know it ain't crawfish season. -How big is the pond? -I should know I dug it. It's four acres. -Hold it, wait. He's out there. No. No. No. Stand up. Don't act any different. He knows I'm in here. -Why doen't he just come in here and blast us? -I don't know. -We have something they want. -Yeah. Your parents money. -I just went to the lawyers. They don't have any. They're broke. -No, they ain't. -The money's in the pond. How much? -Millions. -Holy shit. House made of iron. Iron? Well, what is a house made out of? -Well, uh, wood? -Jackpot! -No way, you're kidding me. Clever girl. No way. -What do we do now? -Look at this. Well, I guess we wait till after dark and then we get in that pond. -You think I'm safe? -Yeah, at least until they find that money. -All right, you stay here and guard the money which ultimately is my life. I have someone I need to see. -Hey, be careful. (intense music) -Hey, darling. How are you? -Better now. -You sure tied one on last night. (laughing) -For you Mama? -Cerveza. -Si. -You know, Spanish? -Nope. -Probably just all the dirty words. Huh, Cidd? (laughing) -I do know what's going on here. -What are you talking about? -I see you. -See what? -You drugged me. -Wait a minute, I never touched you. -No, you didn't. You touched my house. -Prove it. What the fuck, bitch? You have no idea. This thing's too big for you, little girl. -Miles! (intense music) -Just go ahead. I'm already dead. They've killed everyone that I love. You know you can't stop them. You've got to get out of here. You have to leave now. Just leave, please. -You just need to calm down, okay? -I couldn't-- I couldn't help my family. But I want to help you. Okay, just leave. -She bothering you Miss? -No, she's good. -Yeah, well, she's a public drunk and disorderly. -No, she's fine. -Just run. Run Tomi, run! (dramatic music) -Cody? Cody? Cody? Cody? (crying) (sighing) (phone ringing) -Hello Tomi, how are you doing baby? Tomi? Are you there? Did you hang up? -I'm just, missing my parents, and I want somebody to talk to. Sorry. -Don't be sorry, baby. You know we all love you. -I love you. -Henry and I just said how much we missed you. -Really? -Henry and I are going to take you to supper soon. Let you pick any restaurant you want. -I'd love that. -If you need any help going through things, I can help. You home now? -Yeah. -Why don't you just put some stuff together and I can come over this afternoon and help. -Yeah, I'll go do that now. -Well, I have food on the stove, but we love you. -Love you. -Bye. -Bye. (crying) (upbeat music) (groaning) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) -Where are you off to Tomi? -Back to school. -But you dropped out. You don't want to do that. There's nowhere to go, Tomi. -You looking for this? -No, please. -The money, it's in the pond. -Four acres. It was there the whole time. (laughing) Your dad. -Please, I promise I won't tell anyone. Please, please, please. No, please. Help! Help! Help! Help! -No one can hear you Tomi. Help me, help me! -Help me! (laughing) -Please. (punch thuds) Uh! (groaning) -Shhh, shh, shh, shhh. It's too late to go back to school. It's too late to go anywhere. (sighing) (crying) -Please. (punch thuds) -Those two hits will help you not feel anything, Tomi. The night your parents died, I was in the house. He died on his knees as your mother begged for his life. -Get back, get back. (gunshot) -Your mother, on the other hand. Oh! Oh. She went screaming. -Ahhh! (gunshot) -How will you go? -I got this, pendejo. (gunshot) -Let's go dump her. (intense music) (upbeat music) (light upbeat music) -Hmmm. -(speaking Spanish) I shot a lot of people in my life. Enough that where I can graze somebody if I want to. (speaking Spanish) -Why would you help me? -Selfish reasons. Querer comer? -I don't. I don't think I can eat. -I don't have a problem eating. Juice then? Your padre, he was a loyal and honorable man. He always did right by me. But Ben, that (speaking Spanish). He's messing with my money and I can't let that happen. And now he's trying to mess with your money. Your padre, he made that money straight up. He risked a lot for the people of this town. -My dad was in his way. -They're all power hungry. They killed a lot of people for Ben. Jealousy and greed. -Penelope? -No. She's no more. The cop, he did her. And that red bandana fucker, he killed her hijo and the husband. A few months back, because they talked too much. -Cody. -He's safe for now. But they need him to run drugs. Because that's what Ben wants to do too. -I need to run. -You know too much. They'll find you. -What if I call the FBI? -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Cálmate. -What am I supposed to do? -We need to make it right. -How? -All right look, I'm going to finish my Mexican breakfast because it's starting to get cold, and then, we're going to go kill them all (speaks Spanish). -I don't think-- -It's you, or it's them. (speaks Spanish) You have until I finish to decide. (upbeat music) -Fuck'em! -(speaks Spanish) Vamos.

Some of us do wrong, hurt others, and the powers that be say it's legal and just. Some of us fearfully do what we have to do in order to keep a roof over our heads. Despite the powers who say you'll be arrested and put away. The powers do not walk in our shoes. People have been doing what my dad endured for thousands of years and I will always think of him as my own personal Robin Hood. I think it's time for us to redefine those two simple words, good and bad. Somehow, I think they've gotten twisted over the years. As for me, you can find me in the Deep South on the Voodoo Duck, fishing the waters I snatched back from the jaws of greed and bureaucracy.
