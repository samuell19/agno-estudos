[THE DHARMA CHAKRA PERPETUALLY TURNS] [THE DHARMA PROPAGATES FORTH] DIVINATION SLIP: SEVEN. SON. ADVANCE. SIX. SON. RETURN. [SPIRIT TABLET OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE YANG CLAN] "Seven sons go forth, "six sons return." Mother. It seems the campaign at Golden Beach will not bode well for the Yang Family. Mother. According to this divination slip, well... We will eventually lose an elder brother. Indeed. For the sake of expelling the barbarians from our nation of Great Song, even if a life must be sacrificed, it is worth it. However, of my seven sons, I do not know which one will sacrifice himself to save the kingdom! Arrival of the Father of the Empress...! My daughter, I bring dire news. Your brother-- Pan Mei seeks audience with the Lady of the Southern Palace. - Arise. - Thank you, My Lady. Father, what is it? This morning at the arena, your third brother, Pan Pao... was beaten to death. Third Brother is dead?! Who killed him?! It was Yang Yeh's seventh son: Yang Ssu! Yang Ssu...? - Father, I want-- - My Lady. - Stand down! - Understood. Father, I will petition His Majesty to have Yang Ssu convicted! No, wade through grass without alerting snakes. Yang Yeh's position in the Imperial Court is already too secure. As long as the Yang Family is undivided, they will be a thorn in our side! Father, what should we do? At the battle of Golden Beach, I will annihilate the Yang Family! Kill...! Charge...! Such mighty Yang Family Spearplay! It truly lives up to its renown! Your end is now. Traitor! Fifth Brother! Fifth Brother...! Sixth Brother...! Big Brother...! Kill! Barbarians! Third Brother! I must kill...! Brothers, we kill...! Third Brother...! Hold it! Do not kill him. Take him back with us. Second Brother! Second Brother...! [GRAVESTONE OF LI LING] Yang Yeh! Pan Mei...! Fire! Chi-Lang! Traitorous viper...! Fire! What patriotism! Charge! Seventh Brother! Father...! Father... We, the Yang Clan, have been nothing but loyal! Why would His Majesty take heed of a villain, sending the Generals of the Yang Family into a trap here at Golden Beach, destroying us, the Yang Family?! Traitorous official! Barbarians...! Show yourselves! Show yourselves...! I found them... I found them! Kill...! Sixth Brother! Sixth Brother! Stop it! No! You're not! - Kill! Kill...! - Sixth Brother...! [TIEN-PO RESIDENCE] [FROM THE EMPEROR TO THE YANGS: THIS HOUSE BE FULL OF PATRIOTS] LILY LI as DOWAGER SHE - Mother. - Mother. - Pa-Mei offers greetings to Mother. - Chiu-Mei offers greetings to Mother. Mother, you don't need to be so worried. Father is leading our seven brothers into battle at Golden Beach, they will definitely return victorious. That's right, Mother. With our peerless Yang Family Spearplay! Chiu-Mei, don't be like that. Those Liao Kingdom barbarians will be scared just hearing our name! But there has been no news at all since. Pan Mei suddenly advised His Majesty to despatch the Yang Family on an expedition to the northern border. This must be some kind of a plot. Furthermore, the divination slip read: "Seven sons go forth, six sons return." Could there be another interpretation? - Sixth Brother! - Liu-Lang! Barbarians, show yourselves! Show yourselves...! - They've returned victorious! - They've returned victorious! They've retur-- Liu-Lang, where is your father? Pan Mei... Pan Mei...! Where are your brothers?! Traitorous official... Traitor...! Liu-Lang, where are your younger brothers? Liu-Lang, tell me! Tell me...! Big brother! What are you doing?! Sixth Brother...! - Mother! - Young master! Liu-Lang! Liu-Lang! You are a good child. Calm your mind. Tell your mother... what actually transpired at the battle! Yes, Sixth Brother. Tell Mother why you only you alone rushed home in the dead of night? - I'm home...? - Right! You've come home! Sixth Brother, how many barbarians did you all slay? Good child... Tell me. - Kill...! - Big Brother! Poke poke poke poke poke poke poke poke...! How many did I slay? I couldn't kill a single one. Let me tell you something. Golden Beach... was a trap! Pan Mei... Pan Mei... You want to eradicate us, the Yang Clan? Let me tell you something. Eldest Brother... was... stabbed to death by short swords! Mother! Second Brother was... disembowelled by manic hooks! His guts flew everywhere...! Third Brother's death was even more tragic! Thousands of troops and thousands of horses went... and trampled him to death. Fourth Brother... was taken captive by the barbarians! Fifth Brother vanished without a trace... Little Seventh Brother... Poke poke poke poke poke poke poke poke...! died from ten thousand arrows through the heart...! Mother! Mother! What about your... father, then...? He smashed his skull... on the Gravestone of Li ling! Father...! Yang Yeh...! Why are you kneeling? I'll kneel as well... Pan Mei...! Liu-Lang... Seven sons go forth... Six sons return... And so it would be the battle of Golden Beach, from which only my sixth son would come home. The will of the heavens... [INNER YANG] [PROSPERITY, STATUS, LONGEVITY, JOY] My Prince, to what do I owe the pleasure? Pan Mei, we have already fulfilled our role in this affair, and eliminated the Generals of the Yang Family at Golden Beach. The Prince is here to ask why you haven't you kept your word and pulled back the Song troops at the border so we, the kingdom of Great Liao, can enter unimpeded! The Prince commands my absolute loyalty. However, there is something that weighs heavily on my heart. That is Yang Wu-Lang and Yang Liu-Lang still reside in this mortal plain! Men! YEUNG SAI-GWAN as KHITAN GENERAL SEK GONG as KHITAN GENERAL - My Prince! - My Prince! Our plan was utterly infallible. Our weapons were designed specifically to defeat the Yang Family spear. How could they have escaped?! My Prince, you should give them the chance to atone for their failure. We must act swiftly. If Wu-Lang and Liu-Lang were to retaliate, it would affect your grand plans to advance troops into the Central Plain. Pan Mei, we shall intercept from every direction and kill them. We must pull them up the roots! Barbarian! LAU KAR LEUNG as HUNTER You bandit! Are you a Yang deserter?! No! I'm not a deserter! You're not? Then why have you come to a place as remote as this?! This has nothing to do with you! Who are you?! Who am I? I live here! I survive by hunting. A simple hunter removed from the world! Gallant sir, I had been overcome with paranoia. I mistook you for a Barbarian. So you fought against the barbarians? Correct. A battle at Golden Beach to expel the barbarians. We were ambushed. Oh... No wonder you came here to hide. Wrong! We, the Generals of the Yang Family, do not cling to life, fearing death! You don't cling to life, fearing death? Then why didn't you stay on the beach to kill the enemies?! We, the Generals of the Yang Family... fell to a trap by the Father of the Empress. But Pan Mei and Yang Yeh have always fought side by side! Indeed! We could have imagined at the battle of Golden Beach... he would bring ruin to the Yang Family?! General of the Yang Family, let me tell you this. I was once a general beneath Pan Mei's banner! I know him well. He has always envied the great deeds the Yang Family have done for Song. He also fears that he will disgrace himself before His Majesty. So he conspired with the barbarians, betraying his kingdom to destroy the Yang! Pan Mei... You traitorous viper! I'd risk death to condemn you at the Imperial Court. I want you torn to pieces! - How can you return there now? - You're right! He has colluded with the barbarians... to hunt me down wherever I go. He is leaving no one alive. Yes. Gallant sir, all my brothers are gone. The blood of my father Yang Yeh stains the Gravestone of Li Ling. I, Yang Wu-Lang, am the sole survivor. General Yang Wu-Lang. I am. I hope gallant sir will lend me his strength, and join me in testifying against Pan Mei. General Yang, it is of no use. Pan Mei is all powerful now. As if His Majesty would trust me, an insignificant former general. He will. The tragedy at Golden Beach: I witnessed it with my own eyes! You're the only one still alive! Do you have any proof? The Yang Family have been loyal for a generation. His Majesty will believe us. General Yang, you are much too confident. If Pan Mei can't get rid of you, he will still turn and bite you. He'll accuse you of desertion, of betraying the country! Yes. His Majesty has already issued an edict declaring my defection... and my betrayal... If His Majesty has already branded you a traitor, why would you go back?! - I cannot bear to watch-- - You want to be loyal! But your country won't let you! - And the Yang Family's indignation?! - It must be avenged! But while Pan Mei wields authority, you are but one man! Wu-Lang... As the saying goes: "Ten years is not too long a wait for a gentleman's revenge." Learn to be like me, - and let it go for now... - I cannot! - Surround them! - Aye! Kill...! - Escape using the underground passage. - No! I'll kill them all! He used an underground-- Where is Yang Wu-Lang?! I don't know. - Search! - Aye! If you want to live, then tell me where Yang Wu-Lang is! He's gone. After him! After him! [THIS HOUSE BE FULL OF PATRIOTS] Mother... - Sixth Brother! - Sixth Brother! The two of you, leave him alone. Allow him some peace and quiet. Hopefully, it will speed up his recovery. [TIEN-PO RESIDENCE] - Knock! - Aye! Open up...! Open up...! Ask those outside: Who goes there? How dare they pound at the entrance of the Yang residence! Who is it?! Arrival of Imperial Edict...! Who presents the Imperial Edict?! Father of the Empress of Great Song: General Pan Mei! Pan Mei?! Traitorous viper...! - Sixth Brother! - Sixth Brother! Take him back inside. Take him back inside! I'll kill...! I will kill Pan Mei...! - Open the door! - Open the door! - Search! - Aye! How presumptuous! Great General Pan. The Yang residence is observing a period of mourning for fallen patriots. This is no place for your lackeys to come barging in! We are here to apprehend traitors! And who might be a traitor?! I led the Yang Family soldiers into battle at Golden Beach where soon it was apparent the Yang father and sons fought only half-heartedly. Therefore, the border was lost. There must have been a conspiracy with the barbarians! By the mandate of heaven, the Imperial Court condemns the Father and sons of the Yang Family! What a fine comdemnation from the Imperial Court. We, the Yang Family, are loyal to our kingdom, devoted patriots! His Majesty bestowed upon us long ago: "This house be full of patriots". And to this aged woman, the Dragon Head Cane: To admonish wickedness and banish evil! I bear His Majesty's edict, Madam Yang you... General Pang, you may proceed with your official business uninhibited. The father and sons of the Yang Family fell victim to an ambush at Golden Beach. All of them have already met their demise. You should have investigated first. Who is left for you to apprehend? The Yang Family's hallowed place of mourning for fallen patriots does not abide the interference of outsiders! As far as I know, there are still two on the run. - Two...? - They are Yang Wu-Lang and Yang Liu-Lang. If the two of them were lucky enough to escape death, upon their immediate return here, this aged woman will personally see them to the Imperial Court to face His Majesty. Please relay to His Majesty that under the Dragon Head Cane, there exists no sentiment! - See our guest out! - Understood! - General Pan, please. - General Pan, please. Very well! Madam Yang, I take my leave! - Mother... - Mother... Wu-Lang... Where could you be...? Kill...! Gallant sir... You gave your life to save mine for nothing but the hope that I would live and avenge the country. You spoke the truth. I want to be loyal. But my country won't let me! I must conceal my identity. Bide my time! Kill...! Young master! Young master! Kill...! Kill...! Liu-Lang! You savages! - Sixth Brother...! - The two of you stay back! I must beat out as much of his inner frustration as possible! Kill...! Kill...! Kill...! - Sixth Brother! - Sixth Brother! [SEEK REFUGE IN BUDDHA] [CHING LIANG TEMPLE] [MAHAVIRA HALL] You...! This disciple wholeheartedly devotes himself to Buddha. And you are?! I must be tonsured. I must wholeheartedly devote myself to Buddha! PHILLIP KO as ABBOT OF CHING LIANG TEMPLE - Mount Wutai is far from civilisation. Benefactor, you spared no hardship trekking into such remote mountains to arrive at our humble temple. For what reason have you come here? Great master, the sensuous world is an illusion for this disciple. I am determined to enter monasticism! Amitābha. Although I see sorrow in your eyes, they are also filled with malice. Your supposed transformation from red fish to green bell is nothing but an impulsive act. Great master, halt your steps. You understand my intentions, yet you do not ask who I am! Amitābha. This humble monk is a follower of Buddha. He asks not of the affairs of the world. There exists no affinity between us. Why are you offended so? - Benefactor! - I am the infamous traitor, Yang Wu-Lang! Benefactor, please do not tell lies before the Buddha. Great master... I am Yang Wu-Lang! You are not. I am...! A spear without a spearhead. How can this deserve to be called a Yang Family Spear? Do not continue to pose as a General of the Yang Family. I am Yang Wu-Lang...! [YANG WU-LANG] Yang Wu-Lang? Benefactor Yang, please pardon this humble monk's discourtesy just now. Great master... Disciple Wu-Lang has a kingdom he cannot avenge, a family he cannot return to. This is why he severed the spearhead, resolving to seek refuge in Buddha. Benefactor Yang, your body is with Buddha, but your heart lies in the material world. How can you possibly undertake tonsure with a pure heart? Great master...! I want to be tonsured! Don't stand in my way! Great master...! [PURE HEART HALL] Great masters. Do not obstruct me. I wish to forget my existence, seek refuge in Buddha. Please temper my frustrations. Tonsure me! Discourtesy is not acceptable! Benefactor, Ching Liang Temple is a place of purification. Your formidable air should be used to combat enemies on the battlefield. You are right. Be victorious on the battlefield, and enjoy glory and splendour, wealth and status. However... See defeat on the battlefield, and what happens then? CHING CHU (KING LEE) as GREAT MASTER CHIH-KUNG There is no compassion for the fallen. There is no loyalty for the survivors. - Amitābha. - Amitābha. For the followers of Buddha, the sensuous world is an illusion. They ask not of the world. These are the principles this disciple has embraced. I wish to wholeheartedly enter Buddhism. Benefactor, your murderous aura is not yet under control. Furthermore, your heart is heavy with sorrow. Perhaps your fate does not yet lie alongside the Buddha. Benefactor, restrain your savagery! What fine Yang Family Spearplay! I want to be tonsured! Junior brother. The hair lies upon benefactor's own head. If he himself does not want it, who are we to stop him? Understood, Abbot. Amitābha... Amitābha... Thank you, Abbot! Amitābha... Amitābha... Amitāyus. Amitābha. Abbot! You lied to me! Why won't you shave me?! If you won't shave me, I will set Ching Liang Temple ablaze! [THE WISDOM OF BUDDHA IS A SUN HANGING ABOVE] [THOSE LIVING CREATURES FERRIED BY BUDDHA] Fifth Brother...! Young master! Mother. Sixth Brother's mind is still so clouded, how can he testify against Pan Mei at the Imperial Court? Mother, if this continues, the Yang Family will never see justice! Jiu-Mei! Sixth Brother, come to your senses! We're testifying against Pan Mei at the Imperial Court! We're leaving! Sixth Brother, we are mourning our father. How can we go to the Imperial Court and face His Majesty? - Liu-Lang... - Mother, I must go! Sixth Brother! Kill...! Kill...! Sixth Brother! [BUDDHA] Oh, General Yang, you're awake? Great masters... Is this... Is this Ching Liang Temple? Yes, this is Ching Liang Temple's rear courtyard. Then this means I have entered into monkhood. I've become a monk! I've become a mon-- General Yang, it's best you stay here. It's been several days since you've last eaten. I've been unconscious for days? Bring in some vegetarian dishes. General Yang, the abbot has asked that once your wounds have healed to please remove yourself from the temple. [TRANQUILITY] Tell your abbot that I, Yang Wu-Lang, have shaved my head and become a monk. I'm not leaving no matter what! Understand? Understand?! Brother, it's no wonder the abbot said... What did he say?! He said you could never be a monk. He said I could never be a monk? [A CLEAR HEART IS AS A MIRROR] [MEDITATION] [WOLF FANG STAFF] Yang Wu-Lang, why are you here? Great master. As this disciple lacks the still heart to recite sutras, can he instead be a monastery guardian monk, and train with the other brothers? Wolf Fang Staff training chamber is a place only for those ferried by Buddha. You yet to have Buddha in your heart, so how can you practise the staff alongside Buddha? Great master, please rest assured. While Wu-Lang's heart is not yet at peace, the martial arts still survive within him. Moreover, I have lived a hundred battles on the battlefield. What have I to fear of wild mountain wolves? Yang Wu-Lang! Great master, when fighting such ferocious wild wolves, one must make a mess of their four legs. The other wolves will smell the scent of flesh and blood, and so understand the agony of dying. They will never dare return! You are wrong. Wild wolves may violate our vegetable gardens here on Mount Wutai. But we who have entered into monkhood carry the virtue of never taking lives! We never kill another living creature; only wound the fangs of the wolf. No matter how ferocious a wolf may be, it will not be able to unleash its might. Furthermore, we have meted out to them a severe punishment. From then on, they never dare encroach upon Mount Wutai again. At this monastery, we train in poles only to strike the wolves' fangs. Therefore, its name is Wolf Fang Staff. Great master, what you do is incorrect. If you only knock out the wolves' fangs and not kill them, once they have recovered their vigour, they will only regroup with strength to violate your Mount Wutai again. How many monks here can actually face off against these ferocious wolves? Yang Wu-Lang, I always knew your viciousness remained untamed! Great master, from the outset, I only ever wanted to be a monastery guardian monk. This temple will never accept a disciple like you! Great master, since Mount Wutai has already taken me, Yang Wu-Lang, in, it makes no sense that I cannot train with you. - How dare you test me so?! - Junior brother. He speaks the truth. Wu-Lang has Wu-Lang's own beliefs. He is only thinking of the welfare of the temple. Senior brother. These beliefs of Wu-Lang, they already trespass against our Buddhist tenet of no killing. Great masters, this disciple has only just entered into Buddhism and is uneducated in its precepts. For having acted with such impertinence, this disciple asks the two great masters to begin his spiritual practice anew. Yang Wu-Lang, every move and every form of your Yang Family Spearplay is intended for killing. You wish to begin your spiritual practice anew? Then first purify your heart, and keep hold of our precepts. Only then will you be allowed to train within the Wolf Fang Staff Chamber. [TURN YOUR HEAD TO SEE THE SHORE] Yang Wu-Lang! Great master! Please rest assured. This disciple will train until his heart is as pure as water. You transformed the Yang Family Spearplay into a pole form. You have attained martial arts sublimity. Great master, so this means I can join the other brothers in the Wolf Fang Staff Chamber and begin my spiritual practice anew? Yang Wu-Lang, no matter how much you study, Mount Wutai will never be where you belong! - What do you mean? - I hope you leave this temple post-haste! I cannot! I suffered untold hardships, gave away all I had in order to become a disciple of Buddha. I will never leave Mount Wutai! [THE DHARMA HAS NO BOUNDARY] [SUTRA RECITATION HALL] Brother, what has happened? Great Master Chih-Hung has descended the mountain. [TIEN-PO RESIDENCE] Who trespasses onto forbidden land?! Amitābha. Great master, why are you here? I have come to Tien-Po Residence to ferry the souls of the dead into the next life for the Yang Family. Ferry the souls of the dead? Great master, why's there only one of you to perform rites? Indeed. There is only this single humble monk. Where are your kāṣāya and certification? This humble monk has come from afar. and did not bring his kāṣāya and certification. Where did you come from?! I have come from near the border. - Seize him! - Aye! Halt! - Release him. - Aye. - Orders from the General: Let him pass! - Aye! Hey, hey, Great master... You can't-- You can't go in... What's happening? Eighth Mistress, this great master was originally begging for alms at the gate. Now he wants vegetarian dishes, and barged his way in. Yeah! He barged in! He wants vegetarian dishes? Great master, even if you want vegetarian dishes, you should still wait outside. Amitābha. The vegetarian dishes this humble monk seeks, must be personally prepared by Madam Yang herself. What impudence! Monk, those who are not of the Yang Family are not allowed even half a step inside our home! Get out! Amitābha... Who are you?! Eighth Mistress Yang, this humble monk is... You were sent here by Pan Mei?! Pa-Mei! Stop! Mother! This monk is sorely lacking in manners! He barged in here to beg for alms, then wanted Mother to personally cook vegetarian dishes for him! What nonsense! Chiu-Mei! Amitābha. Pa-Mei, welcome the great master inside. Mother... This monk was sent here by Pan Mei! Do not be ill mannered. Quickly welcome his great master inside. Understood. Great master, please. Madam Yang. This humble monk has come here from afar only to beg for alms, and to ask Madam Yang for some vegetarian dishes. Why would I be acquainted with the great general of the Imperial Court: Pan Mei? Sixth Brother! Sixth Brother! Benefactor! Sixth Brother! My child has offended you greatly! Great master, are you hurt? Madam Yang, this humble monk could never have guessed while asking for vegetarian dishes, he would offend members of the Yang Family. Great master, since the Yang Family were ensnared at Golden Beach, this young child's mind has yet to be roused from its stupor. Amitābha. Liu-Lang! Madam Yang, your son's martial arts are extremely mighty. How truly tragic... Had he not suffered such a great trauma, this son's martial arts would be comparable with Yang Wu-Lang's. Wu-Lang...? Benefactor...! - Six Brother! Sixth Brother! - Great master! Why did you bring up my Fifth Brother? Where is he?! - Where is he?! Tell me! - You have to calm down! Benefactor Yang, those who mean well need not run their mouths. Even the slightest affinity will provide awakening. Madam Yang, this humble monk has stayed too long. I take my leave. - Great master! - Sixth Brother! Desist with your questioning. Great master, the vegetarian dishes I will personally prepare, may I ask where I should have them delivered? Mount Wutai. Ching Liang Temple. - Great master...! - Sixth Brother, stop it! So Wu-Lang is on Mount Wutai at Ching Liang Temple. Why did he not return? - I'm going to look for Fifth Brother! - Liu-Lang. Your mind has still not fully recovered. Moreover, Pan Mei's men are everywhere. If you were to make a misstep, how would we testify to Pan Mei's conspiracy at the Imperial Court? Mother, let me go-- I have my own ways. The monk's on his way. Everyone get ready. [TEA] Benefactors, I'm being ambushed! Benefactor, help me! The barbarians have infiltrated the city! You savages...! The barbarians have infiltrated the city! What were you doing at Tian Po Residence? Tell us now! Where is Yang Wu-Lang?! Barbarians...! If you're smart, you'll talk! I don't know... any Yang Wu-Lang... Still not talking?! You wanna die?! We shouldn't stay here long. - Take him back with us! - Aye! Where is Yang Wu-Lang?! All of you tell me. You're a bunch of flunkeys! You couldn't even handle an old monk. Just when will Great Song be mine?! Very well! We'll break into Tien-Po Residence now. We'll see what Dowager She has hidden that will reveal to us Yang Wu-Lang's hiding place! Wait...! My Prince, I implore you to not act brashly. It is only a matter of time before all of Great Song is in your, the prince's grasp. A hasty break-in at Tien-Po Residence will lead to unity amongst the officials of the Imperial Court. This will only be to our detriment. Pan Mei, what is your esteemed advice? Since the old monk appeared at Tien-Po Residence, there will surely be some kind of movement tonight. We simply have to follow this person... Too easy. Pa-Mei. Chiu-Mei. These past few years we have fallen victim to that viper Pan Mei's persecution. No matter what, we must find and bring Wu-Lang home. Vindicate the Yang Family! Mother, since my martial arts is so good, why don't I bring Fifth Brother home? Ninth Sister, Mother has her ways. Don't interrupt! Chiu-Mei, you are still wild and untamed. The road to Mount Wutai is long and difficult. Moreover, Pan Mei has eyes and ears everywhere. If you were to go, it will only end in ruin. Butler Wang. Here. Make the necessary preparations, and arrange for Pa-Mei's departure. Understood, Madam Yang. Chiu-Mei, you are responsible for watching over Sixth Brother. He mustn't set a single step outside the Yang residence. Yes, Mother. Mother, Fifth Brother has always very headstrong. I'm afraid he'll... Compel him with Dragon Head Cane's jade pendant. It is not his place to deny his family! [TIEN-PO RESIDENCE] Hey! Halt! [YANG RESIDENCE] Why's it stink? Where are you going at this time of night?! - Sirs, we are taking out the rubbish. - Taking out the rubbish?! Wait...! Sirs, if we don't get rid of the rubbish all of Tien-Po Residence will smell! I don't care if it stinks. Put it down! Wait...! Orders from the Father of the Empress: Leave the Yang residence servants alone. You can go. You can go. Thank you, sirs. C'mon. C'mon. Let's go. Hey... There's nobody there. This way. Hey, hurry up and put it down. Mistress. Bring the horse, quickly! - It's a young man. - Everyone split up and follow him! Brother Wu-Lang, you can't go in. Wu-Lang as already made pure his heart. I urgently need to see the master of the monastery tonight. Brother Wu-Lang, if this is about your spiritual practice, - wait a few more days first. - That's right. Wait a few more days. Wait a few more days? [A PURE HEART IS AS A MIRROR] My brothers... Why are you not practising the Wolf Fang Staff? Why are you all sitting in silence? What are you all doing? Where is the master of the monastery? Brother... The great master has passed on. Did the great master lose his life to wild wolves?! Tell me! Talk! He did not lose his life to wild wolves! Abbot. The master of the monastery... How did he pass on? Amitābha. Junior Brother Chih-Hung always knew while your body sought monkhood, your heart did not seek Buddha. This is why he spared no effort and travelled to Tien-Po Residence. To the Yang Family. So he...?! He exerted such painstaking effort, in the hopes you would restore the prestige of the Yang Family. Rejoice... Rejoice... I never imagined that while on the road, he would be assassinated. Pan Mei, you viper! Yang Wu-Lang, you should act in accordance with Junior Brother Chih-Hung's wishes, and descend the mountain. Abbot... "I did not kill Po Jen, "But Po Jen died because of me." I must fulfil the master of the monastery's final wish! Rejoice... Rejoice... By doing so, you overestimate yourself. The pole form Wu-Lang developed with a pure heart is beyond adequate! Wu-Lang, what fine pole form! Thank you, abbot. Patrons, take care. Take care. Hey, someone's coming! YUEN TAK as YANG FAMILY SOLDIER [CHU AN INN] Patron! How about a rest? You rat! You dare rob me in broad daylight?! Patron! Patron! Patron! Patron, that jade pendant on your belt is...? Young waiter! What about my jade pendant?! It's-- Patron, how did you come by it? You have no right to ask! If you won't say, that means you stole it. Nonsense! - If it's not stolen, who gave it to you? - It was... - Who are you? - I'm... Tell me! A gold blade?! A Yang Family Gold Blade? You are...? - Help me... - Stop! - Where did you get this gold blade?! - I don't know! Tell me! Golden Beach. - You deserter! - Who are you?! The eighth in line! Eighth Mistress! After the battle, while safeguarding General Yang Yeh's gold blade, I was gravely wounded. It was because of this innkeeper that this former general could stay here. I thank you, elder. Such kind words. The Yang Family are a clan of patriots. The people of Great Song have only admiration. WANG CHING HO as INNKEEPER - Mistress Yang. In such chaotic times, what important business have you to come to the border alone? I'm here to look for Fifth Brother. - General Yang Wu-Lang is still with us? - Yes. There hasn't been any sign of him in these parts though. But an eminent monk from Mount Wutai came to us as Tien-Po Residence. According to his implications... Fifth Brother might be at Mount Wutai. Could General Yang have entered into monkhood? That is a possibility. The Yang Family having suffered such a blow, all of Fifth Brother's hope would have turned to dust. This is why Mother conferred to me the jade pendant of the Dragon Head. To command him to return home and testify against Pan Mei! And restore the prestige of the Yang Family! Very well! We leave for Mount Wutai immediately! Big brother, a group of men just barged in here! Move it! Move! Move aside! Over there! Move aside! Have every person in this inn brought out! Aye! - Pan Mei, you viper! - Pan Mei has us outnumbered! If we go now, we won't make it to Mount Wutai. - Out of the way...! - Mistress Yang, you mustn't act brashly. With how things are, I must impede you for now. Hsiao-Erh, hide Mistress Yang beneath the kitchen stove. - I will have a plan by nightfall. - Right! Move it! - What is happening? - Kneel! Have you harboured the wanted criminal: Yang Wu-Lang? The wanted criminal Yang Wu-Lang? No... No... I really haven't...! No? We followed a young woman dressed as a man here from Tien-Po Residence. She must be meeting up with the criminal! Definitely not! I haven't seen such a person! Innkeeper! - Halt! - They have no say in the matter... - To me. - Here! - Burn this place down! - Wait! My Prince. Yang Wu-Lang may not be here, but Yang Pa-Mei must be! If we burn this place down, the criminal will still elude us. That will be a pointless exercise. The two siblings will meet here eventually. My Prince. General Pan Mei is right. We'll lock up all the guests. No one is allowed to leave! Very well. Innkeeper! No one is allowed to leave, including your workers! - Yes! Yes... - Yes... [GUESTS ARE LIKE COMING CLOUDS] [CHU AN INN] Where are you going?! Tell us! Hsiao-San! Why haven't you brought my supper up? - Supper at this hour? - Yeah! Innkeeper! Sirs, I have supper this late every night. Let him go. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sirs. Hsiao-San, hurry up with that! Young waiter, what are you doing? Sirs. I'm just tying up the coffin. - Tying up the coffin at this hour? - That's right, sir. This corpse must be delivered for burial before dawn. - If not, it'll change. - Change? - Yeah, it'll change! - No funny business! - Hey! Get out here and carry the coffin! - Right! Stop right there! Open it up! - Open it now! - I can't! I can't-- Why not?! Open it! I really can't open it. It'll stink if I do! Open it! Sir, I told you it would stink! - Close the lid! Close the lid! - Right! What is this? Goods buried with the dead, sir. - Sir...! - A gold blade...? Yang Family-- Yang Pa-Mei, you won't get away! Hsiao-Ssu! Yang Pa-Mei, just where is it you are going?!
