FORGER Long live our dear comrade Tito. That was echoing every 25th of May. That spring day, a day that belongs to the young, their holiday and a birthday present to a man that always streamed and fought for their brighter and happier future. Celebration of Youth day has culminated with spectacle at the football grounds of "Yugoslav People's Army" in Belgrade. Program watched by Tito, his wife and highest leader of the country was created by 8.000 performers. Young men with guns, marines with oars, girls in red and white costumes, performed the penultimate part of the program. Performed in a meticulous order it made an impressive picture. In the end they created a big heart made of soldiers hands and the girls in the middle, looking like flower arrangement. I saw him coming out. I was by the ticket office when he walked past. He was medium build, around 170 cm... Everything started, I think, back in 1968. Until then, life here was carefree and happy. And then that thing happened in Belgrade. As I walked in it was horrifying. I think the cinema was called "20th October". I vaguely remember that, I was only 15 and the news did not interest me much, but it was a big thing at the time. - Horrifying... - Mirjana, turn off that radio, please. I am working. I need to concentrate. I found a woman, bloodied face... ...screaming. I looked down... and I realized... she had no legs. She had no legs! Did you see what happened in Belgrade? To kill and maim so many people... who could have done that? What kind of people are they? Serbo-croat language? Give him A. A. - Maths? - A. You would like all top marks. Man that is good at humanity's usually is not so good at science - ...and vice versa. - That's right. - Shall we give him C? - We will give him "B"... and that will make it overall grade B. - From which school would he graduate? - High school... Leather technician. He'll finish with B, so God bless him. I wish he'd bless us too. Everybody gets something from you but us never! Mirjana, I told you before, I am not doing this to benefit from it. You can explain that when they... Nobody will touch me. I'm not a criminal like someone else. What are you then? They falsify money, artifacts, documents... - Certificates are not documents then? - Kids, stamps...! I am a Headmaster. My job is to issue certificates. If only we don't have to run again. Now we twist it a bit... so is not that visible. Ink! Now Drago, you are a man at last. Only when you graduate you are ready for life. I knew it! All clear. It's only Smajo. What happened? Good day, good people! - Have you done the polls tickets? - Of course, as usual. - How many fixed odds? - 5. Listen: Partizan, Dinamo, Crvena Zvezda, Sloboda and my Celik. Great, how much is my half? 800.320 combinations again. Miro, where is the money for electricity? They will cut us off again, Andjelko! - Good morning, comrade Headmaster! - Good morning, dear children. We don't have bread in the house and you are throwing all that money on the lottery! This is safe investment, Miro, once we get it right we will all benefit from it. When is that going to happen? - It has to happen, once. - There is no profit without a risk. That's right, partner. I'll be off, before they close... - Good morning, Comrade Headmaster. - You are late! Smajo, what are the odds? Up yours, Smajo! There were 17 nationalities in our village, at the time. They spoke different languages, followed different traditions but it didn't stop as interacting and respecting one another. Thinking about what has preceded these demonstrations, I have realized that the revolt that has existed within young people, within students, came spontaneously. I have realized that huge number of students, 90% of them, are honest youth that we did not have taken proper care of. Hello, neighbor. Any news? Student demonstrations in Belgrade. - What's up with them? - I don't know, but Comrade Tito is sided with them. Sided with those who are against him? They didn't know the truth. And, truth is? It was not him stealing, they were lower ranks. Come on Andjelko, don't be stupid. Look at his clothes, like a tzar, Napoleon. Drago, can't you understand? Sit down! He represents Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia is expected to lead Non-Aligned countries, which are half of the world. They look to the one who has most feathers on his head, and follow him like a god. Asians, Africans and rest of the colored,. are used to listen to the chiefs. That's the way he dresses up. Stand up! Congratulations, Comrade Glavinic. Thank you, my friend. - I owe you. - Oh, no! You have deserved that with your hard work. Yes, but authorities are asking for certificate. Bureaucracy. They are worse than the thieves those students are demonstrating against. You are right. I'll ask you to take this now... Here, have more... I told you before, I am not doing this to benefit from it. I do it for the people that deserve certificates, but never had a time to go to school. Still, I don't understand why you wouldn't you take it? Because I don't want to do anything suspicious There is not many honest people left around. There is, but we don't like showing off. We keep quiet and do our work. I will never forget this. You better forget. We don't want any problems later. All right then. - Hello Miro. - Hello. Don't let Andjelko find out, please, he'll kill me. Don't worry, it's between me and the driver. You have to live of something, don't you? He doesn't want to hear about it... I know! - Onions, do you want some? - Well, yes, please. Just take it. - That's enough. - Come on, a bit more. - Thank you, Drago. - It's nothing, nothing at all. Results of last fixtures of Yugoslav football championship, season '67-'68. 1968 was a strange year. We heard the news that all of the world was taken by some sort of madness. Something like World Youth Revolution. That would not concern me much if strange things didn't start happening to us too. Dad... Wait a bit. I am finishing the certificate for Djuro. - He's got a job as a security guard... - Dad... ...in the Culture Center but he has no school at all. Let us tell you... And I thought... C grade and excellent behavior. It seems we won the jackpot... And at least 10 second prizes... Have they announced the prize? - They have. Record breaking. - At least a hundred millions. - How much?! - A hundred millions. Half goes to Smajo. Why? It's four of us and he is on his own. Shame on you, Mirjana! 50 millions is not enough?! - I want a bike. - I want scooter. I need a fridge. And a new dinning set for 12... And a TV. Everybody but us has one. Wait, there are so many in need. This is our money. You skimp and saved for 8 years because of this, and now that we got lucky we got to share it with god knows who. Come in! Don't just stand there. You have done it... Congratulations. Mirjana! Drinks! Look at him, he is in a bit of a shook... Maybe it isn't as much as you thought... It isn't. No? Nothing. Nothing?! Kids, why did you lie to me?! We didn't, Dad... It's not kids, it's me. - You haven't paid in? - No, I have... So what's the problem? I didn't pay in 320 combinations... So, how many then? 32. So it's not full system. We haven't got anything. You are mistaken. It's nicely written here 320 combinations. I added a 0... You have... Why? For years we have been paying 320 and now... This is not the first time, is it? Since when are you doing this? From the beginning? Unbelievable. I thought all of us would have heart attack. Really, all that money... And you know, he was not sorry for the money at all. What was he sorry about then? He said: "I am sorry that my friend has betrayed me." I think he has lost it a bit. Really, all that money and he is worried about Smajo... Miro, give us one more round. That year was in every way different than the others. It started with bad signs. Apart from village and food store, in which our mother worked, being flooded, the tax inspector paid a surprise visit. Is someone smoking here or am I imagining? Mirjana? Well, I don't know, I was... Is someone, maybe, drinking alcohol? Not really... - What's this then? - Floods have brought it in. Would you kindly give me a Vinjak? - Liter? - No, 0.05. This is open?! Would you please pass me another one. What is this now? This one has been opened too. Interesting. It's all right, what do I owe you? A hundred... And how much is a liter? A thousand... Liter is a thousand and 0.05 is a hundred?! That is a recommended retail price... Is it possible that Vinjak, from these big bottles, has found its way in these little bottles?! Sorry? I am asking if you are pouring drinks from big bottles into small ones and making double money?! Not long after, gossip has started in our village, that there is something going on between Janez, our local Vet, and Slavica, the wife of our neighbor Drago. I have to admit, I did not quite understand what was all that about, all I knew was that from there on, everything went down hill. What is it, Slavica? When are you going to take me in for a treatment? Excuse me? Look at the Drago's make up on Slavica. He has beaten her up. You know what they say, if man doesn't beat you, he doesn't love you... Even though I wasn't interested in the stories of the men in front of mum's shop, this time it looked there was something in it. From the moment Slavica was taken to the hospital things had started to speed up. What's wrong with her? Lady's things? - She is not ill... - So what is it? She is cheating on me. With a Vet. With Janez? Are you sure? She admitted to me this morning. I questioned her... ...all night. The most important thing is, it's not something on her lungs. She lost her way and she will find it again. I don't think so. Not after what I did to her last night. - Speak up! - I was not with him. Don't lie to me! - Is he better looking? - No... - Is he nicer than me? - No... - Does he fuck better? - No... I mean, I don't know! You should not beat your wife. I know. - But that's not the worst of it. - What is it then? I went to the police this morning, to chief Popovski. You've come to admit it all. I know. I've heard what you've done. I'm not reporting myself. Him! - Whom? - The Slovenian. Wait a bit. Why him? But he didn't do anything wrong. He didn't commit a crime. Morally yes, but in the eyes of the law he didn't. Treating animals with false certificate? Wait a second. You told Popovski that Vet has a false certificate? Does he not? And that I have given it to him? Popovski knew it was one of yours. He is giving you until tonight to disappear and only then would he arrest the Slovenian. To disappear? What about my family? Popovski said you should hide somewhere until the dust settles. To hide? Where? I don't know. I'm sorry Andjelko, I had to. - Andjelko? - It's me. I'm taking over from Ljubo. Is that so. Thank you. Not at all, I owe you. How is that? I don't even know you. It was hairdressing school. I made you a hairdressing certificate. Not for me, for my daughter. - I don't remember. - It doesn't matter, I do. - I don't want to be in the way... - Not a word! Your room is waiting. Let's go. That is how Dad's illegal faze started. It was out of the question to hide around the village, so he ran to a big city. His conspirators were owners of false certificates that he has given to them who knows when. Was it from being grateful or from fear of being found out yet they organized an intricate hiding web. Can I have a popcorn? Have it all. Wake up! Let's go. What about me?! I'll be back. We saw Dad next, in the winter. Smajo brought a telegram that said that uncle Dadomir will be waiting for us on Wednesday, in a coffee shop. We never heard of that uncle, but we realized it was a code for Dad... What would you like? Nothing. Nothing? OK, two glasses of water. Water? Boys, can I get you something? I'll have an orange. A soda. I'll have a lemonade. May I? How are you? How is mother? We are all fine, don't worry. Mom sends you roasted chicken. Everybody is asking about you. We don't say anything, just as we agreed. And where did you say that you are going today? To buy notebooks and books for school. Excellent. Who is the Headmaster? - Some Dick. - Sorry? That's his name. He came from Petrinja. Mick Dick. When are you coming home? When Popovski says it's clear. He should have been here by now... You may go as well. I'll wait on my own. He said you helped him 15 years ago. Rodic. Do you remember him? No. But he will recognize me. You should just go. I am in a hurry. I should really leave. Goodbye. Thank you once again. Good afternoon. Milosevic? Andjelko? It's me. You don't recognize me? I'm afraid I don't. Try again. I really don't, Comrade Rodic. I was told I did something for you 15 years ago... Rodic? No, it's Suljo. We sat together in school! - Suljo Mandzuka? - Yes. I would never recognize you. I won't have anything. A cream cake. In fact, give me two. I'm on a diet, but you don't live forever. You live here? No. I am passing through, waiting for a friend, Rodic... What kind of friend... you thought that I was him. More of an acquaintance. And what do you do? Civil service. Export/Import? Diplomatic service? No. Security. National security. By the time I eat this cake, you get ready and off we go. Where to? With me, to see what paperwork you do. To whom are you giving false diplomas to. Sit down. Great cream cakes. Rodic, you said? You motherfuckers, the both of you. What are you doing here, you poor bastard? Here are the biggest criminals that mother Earth has ever held. Here, the one in the corner, he slaughtered a whole family, all four of them. Isn't that right, Ljubinko? Away from me! And the little one, Miljenko. What do you think he has done? Look at him, like a girl. He blew up 50 people! Where did you plant the bomb, you little Nazi? Or this guy, Enes. He, they say, wanted to create an Islamic republic, but he didn't, honest to God. He is jailed because of his cap. Turkish cap, what do you call it? Ahmedia, is it? You'd rather give your life... ...but your cap, no way. And me, Veselin Vucic... I've been here for 18 years. Kill me now if I am guilty! In fact, I am. I am. I am. I am guilty... for believing in Tito, double-dealing bastard. On "Naked Island" seagulls don't fly, work brigades are working hard hurray, hurray! Stop that, man! Hip hurray for Tito! Come down, Veselin! Hurray! "Party is my mother," "Beacon of light in the gloom" Nothing. - Is this any good? - Excellent. Sorry, I have forgotten you. If, comrade Veselin, I hear one more word you going in the "hole". Is that clear? For a long time, we didn't know where Dad was. But the prison warden told us that he is okay and not to worry because he's given special treatment. What do you want? Who are you? And why didn't Kangrga beat you? - I don't know. - Bollocks, you don't know. - Snitch?! - No. I'm a forger. - What are you? - A forger. I made false certificates, but I overdid it a bit. I made 15 hundred of them. My neighbour reported me. In fact, he thought that someone with my diploma had something with his wife and... Getting ready for jihad. What does that mean? Oi, Nazi! You are getting too big for your boots. I only ask for translation. Oh, alright then. Sorry. My Lord, you are the salvation, and from you, we receive salvation. Blessed is one that possesses greatness and generosity. Hats off to you! What about us who don't believe in Allah? God is one. - What are you writing? - What do you care? I'm only asking... I'm making a list of villains and crimes that were done to me. Not to be forgotten. Does He know that you're doing time? - Who? - He. Comrade Tito. What do you mean? - Does He personally know? - Yes. Of course not. He is a mass murderer and the biggest criminal in the world. Have you ever thought of writing to him? To explain your situation, to tell him it's a mistake. For 18 years I'm resisting and I'll resist for another 118! Nobody breaks Veselin Vucic and never will. "Stand up, all victims of oppression..." Please, don't! - "Arise, you branded by a curse" - He'll kill us all! When he finds out, he will certainly do something. I'm certain... You've worked hard, haven't you? To whom did you... To start with I remembered, afterwords... In the court just say: "I don't remember anything". And that's it. But why? You said you don't remember anything. Let's leave it like that. Comrade Warden. - May I ask you something? - Feel free. Why doesn't Kangrga ever beat me up? Sorry? He was ordered not to. Would you please order him to beat me too? Why? In the cell, they think I'm a snitch. All right, if you insist. One more thing? If you could... post this letter. - Kangrga opens the mail. - You don't say? No problem. You are writing to him personally? Miljenko, calm down. What is it, Teach? You see them, don't you? Who? People from the cinema. Nightmares? No. I don't feel sorry for them. I did it for my people. Croatia will be independent one day. Yugoslavia is a deathbed of nations. All right, but when you planted the bomb, did you look around? Have you remembered a face? Name of the film? No. I don't. How can you live with it? I don't have to live with it. No? Someone else is eaten by it. Who? My brother. Vinko, he carries it. Why? - What has he done? - All of it. I only went with him. I wasn't even 16, they didn't trust me with such serious thing. Vinko was 22. Wait a second. Are you telling me... that he planted the bomb? He took it in under his jacket. Where were you? In the park next to the cinema. Where is he now? Don't know. In Germany, Stuttgart I suppose. They don't let me have any visits or mail. If he planted the bomb... why are you here? I'm underage. Can't get death penalty. 10 years in juvie the most. That's why they chose me. 10 years is not much. You got 10 years? No, I'm waiting for a hearing. Time in here will be counted, isn't it, Teach? Give it! Give it! This is why you're here and you still haven't had enough. You've got mail, Comrade Veso. How come? No one ever writes to me. Tito's office. Provocation! Read it! Let us hear what he has to say to you. Comrade Veselin, I have read your complaints as to a conduct - of some officials during your time... - What complaints? I assure you, authority's will look into all possible irregularities... I never complained to anyone. if it's concluded that guards or higher ranking officers in the correction facility have injured you physically or morally they will be penalized strongly. Josip Broz Tito. Did I, Veselin, ever caused you "physical or moral harm"? This is what we do. You are going to the Hole, for a month or two, to think how much and who has harmed you. Right? Come on! Make sure someone takes my notebook to safety, in case I don't come back. About that notebook... well... during my first visit, Dad gave me the notebook, together with chicken leftovers and whispered to take it out. Everything would've been just fine if I didn't pop out of the bus to buy a ticket for Melano. I'd never been to the circus before and this was my last chance. Respected guests! Through the world of magic, mystic and fantasies you will be taken by the world famous thief, illusionist and hypnotist Bora III. Let's see, who wants to be hypnotized. Quickly! Volunteers? You, don't be shy. Why are you hiding? Here is a brave one. Bravo! What's your name? - Slobodan. - Bravo! Applause! There I met a man who somehow changed my life. He was a honest thief by trade, but he never took anything from me. He gave me something that became the most important thing in my life Your eyelids are heavy. You are falling asleep. You are sleeping. There is a girl in front of you. Dark hair pale skin with almond colored eyes. You are in love with her. She loves you. Relax. She is touching you. Gently. You lay down in the grass. You cannot live without her. Together forever. Studying? No, I am Hafiz. You are what? Memorizer. One that knows Qur'an by heart. You don't have to read at all? When we did something wrong the priest would make us say the Hail Mary a hundred times. That's different. We have taken the vows from those who call themselves Christians. Allah will let them know what have they done. You are completely out of tune! They took your cap and you lost it. Have a fucking cap! You are like everyone, that he makes. He forgives and he punishes. Allah is the ruler in heaven and on Earth, and everyone goes back to him. I believe in Jesus so fuck you and that Allah of yours. Do you hear? Sinners are those that say God is savior, son of Mary. Who can stop Allah to destroy your savior, son of Mary and everybody on Earth if he wants to? Say another word and I will strangle you. As long as I follow Allah's path, as a martyr I am dying, and if that is his pleasure. Blessed will be dismembered body of mine. Shame on you! Let him go! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Let him go! Fuck off, you Nazi! God is one! - One death penalty is not enough? - No, it is. Miljenko, get ready for tomorrow. Your hearing begins. - Tomorrow? - Yep. Today is your birthday. You are not a minor anymore. That is quite something. Get out. No offense, it's my job. Nothing personal. I know. It was just a question of time till I was found out. That's the way to look at it. There is a way to improve your situation. How? To cooperate. It will be taken in consideration in court. I would cooperate, but... I don't remember all those people. That's not what I meant. No? Those are some serious bastards in your cell. Veseline, Stalin supporter, then that little Nazi... That one. He's innocent. What do you mean? The bomb was planted by his brother. When it happened, he was a minor. They thought he couldn't get death penalty so he took the blame. Who are they? His people from Stuttgart, Germany. - Nazis? - I don't know. You don't know? Nazis, bloody motherfuckers! - What's his brother's name? - Vinko. Those Court bastards... they prolonged the case until he was 18 and now they've got him. He will go down for something he did not do. What else did he say? Any names? I need a favor. This letter... Could you post it? They open the mail here. To whom are you writing? Comrade Josip Broz Tito, Presidency, Belgrade. You had all the checkups? They will send an innocent man to death. Listen. Fuck you and your kindness. You are an egoist. You are a sick man. You, helping people? Bollocks you are! People are evil! The world is evil! Remember that! Everybody, your little Nazi too, they'd rather see you suffer than be happy. So fuck them all forever and ever! Forever and ever! You going to send my letter? - You taking a piss? - Yes or no? I'll send it. Let Comrade Tito see how mad you are. In the meantime animals in our village started dying. When farmers brought a sick pig in front of the police station, Popovski got rid of the complaint against the Vet. He said, he doesn't want any problems because of him. Everybody has Dad's diplomas, anyway. Veterinarian? Janez, it's you? My sow is having piglets. Could you come urgently? Great. I'll wait. And as if nothing happened, Janez was back to work and everyone was happy... except our neighbour Drago. As he later put it, something was eating him inside that he could not sleep. Drago, what's with you? Kneel! Kneel next to a sow! Now sing. - Excuse me? - Excuse you as much as you like. Sing! - What should I sing? - What you sang to my Slavica. - I sang to Slavica? - You did. Those rude ones. Don't understand. What rude... Don't play stupid. Every day you sang dirty, after dirty song, until she... gave in. She could take no more. Sing! Janez sang, that day, all he knew, with the exception of the "Sunshine Goes Down." That he wouldn't sing, at the cost of life. Drago didn't insist, it was enough to see the Slovenian sing all his romantic repertoire to a sow. How did I go so wrong? I beat Slavica for nothing. What could the poor woman do? No one knows how long that lasted. While the drunks in front of the shop told the story, over and over, I've realized that I will never fully understand why love has to be so complicated... Logical. They waited till you are 18 to sentence you. Why doesn't your brother admit it? He's letting you go to death. - What kind of brother is he? - Dead one! He was killed in Stuttgart last week. Mother told me. How? Who... Secret police, mother said. They knew everything. Someone snitched. But who? Come on, Miljenko. Don't shit yourself. What are you afraid of, death? Life is just a big scum, bigger than Andjelko's forgeries. I've been lied to whole my life. When I was a boy, my parents promised me sweets and toys to go to bed. In the morning the bastards are playing stupid! When I grew up, everything was the same. My best friend sold me out. He grassed me to police for stealing a car radio. Sleazebag, sang after two slaps. My girlfriend... She cheated on me. With anybody. She only hasn't slept with those who were in a hurry. But she wouldn't have me all that often. Had to beat her senseless just to take her knickers down. My Dad was an officer. He got me a job. I started... getting to work on time and that... but my colleague from the office started taking things from me. I caught him one day. Hands in my drawer, looking for something. I grabbed him. "What are you doing?" He said "Looking for indigo paper, I need to type something". I made indigo from him. Beat him senseless. I didn't kill him... he just lost an eye. Of course, I got the sack and two years prison. I get released, go home, parents are conveniently dead, flat empty... I said to myself: Great, Ljubinko, new beginning. But bollocks! My neighbor. Above me... He was some sort of a church goer, restorer or something. Smoke in the hallway, everywhere. Smells like in a fucking church. I went upstairs to tell him to sort it out. His wife opens, gives me a look. I told her nicely to tell her husband to stop all that, it's unbearable, all that smoke. She slams the door in front of my nose. Next day, I meet his son in the hallway. Little sod, with hair. I told him to tell his father not to go around with that church stuff. He looks at me all drugged up and sneaks past me, the little fucker. I already had insomnia, couldn't sleep at night. I'm wandering around... I was coming back, one night, when I found his daughter snogging with some jerk. I grabbed him for an ear. I didn't want to rip it off but he was resisting. Her, I didn't hit that hard, just in passing. She started screaming, crying. She ran, fuck knows where. Sometime later, knock on my door. It was him. Came to complain because of his daughter. I said: "Listen, neighbour..." He put his foot in the door! I said: "Wait for me and remember where you are at," "I'll be back to explain it all to you." I went to the bedroom, took a bayonet, it's my father's from the war, you see... You killed him? No, I had discussions with him all night?! I lost it! Went upstairs, made havoc. The wife I killed right there, in the doorway. But, the boy... He started running around the flat. I had to chase the little fucker. Run this way, that way. If it wasn't for his hair I wouldn't catch him. The worst was his daughter. I couldn't find her. She hid. I looked everywhere. It was as if the Earth had swallowed her. I was about to give up when I heard a noise... Not in the flat, outside. I just... That was it. I don't regret killing them. Not at all. And I'm not regretting that very soon I'll be leaving this cheap scum called life. Look what I made for you. Everything that you like. Drago sends you home brew. The solicitor said that the Judge is on our side. - What's the judge's name? - Djordjevic. Is that the one you did the final essay for? It's not, that's someone else. Maybe he has your diploma, anyway. I'm not interested. Not interested? I'm guilty. I want a fair hearing. Are you in your right mind? A fair hearing in the country where everybody steals and cheats?! I can't lie anymore. I had enough. How are the kids? Jugoslav issues driving licenses now. He works in the police? No. So how does he do it? Eggs. Remember how you copied a military college stamp, with a hard-boiled egg? See, the boy remembered, got himself some blank forms, and it's a production line. Slobodan? He wants to become an illusionist. What? Since he went to circus, he wants to be an illusionist or die. What about you? I need a job. There is no other way. - Who is going to employ you now... - Janez said I could work in the Vet's. It's nice of him to want to help. I need a diploma. Any diploma. I can't. Why? You made it so many and you don't want for me? It's not that I don't want to. I can't anymore. Comrade Ljubinko, wake up. It's time. Come on. You are going to a death row. What about the appeal? There is no appeal. Come on. No, there is. Let me be. I won't go. Come down. I don't want to go! Veso, don't let them take me, please. - Let go of me! - Save me, brother! I'm innocent, Kangrga! I was not even in the cinema. Understand? They chose me because I was a minor! Allah, master of the worlds, we pray to you... Kangrga, why do you never hit me? - Fuck off, you snitch! - I'm not a snitch, you animal! I'm a forger! Now I had it! Father was saved from certain death, from crazed Kangrga, by a huge earthquake that hit Banja Luka that 29th, October 1969. Move, you fucker! Are you alive? From the ruins of the prison, only one prisoner escaped. The others did not think about it at the time or like our father, didn't want to use the ideal situation. Considering that accused didn't charge for his services, as well as the lack of evidence about the quantity of certificates that my client, allegedly issued... Allegedly?! There are... Please, don't interrupt me. I demand not to be interrupted! Please colleague, don't interrupt. Continue. The investigation procedures, filled with the inconsistencies and vague statements... My apologies, how... We have 14 witness statements... We believe that the accused has committed a few minor offenses, not realizing the consequences of his actions... I knew the consequences. Accused, don't interrupt! I knew what I was doing! Please, don't speak anymore. This is not a court trial! This is a farce! Security, remove the accused! I have to be sentenced! People! I'm guilty! I want a fair hearing! Defense, continue. Are you saying, - they have dropped the charges? - Yep. The lack of evidence. Another hearing? No. Great. - Couldn't be better... - Yes. The godless will be judged by the sword. What happened to my notebook? My younger, he lost it in a circus. Child... Are you ready, forger? Sorry, I wouldn't want to impose any "physical or moral harm". Don't worry. I'll find the way to inform Comrade Tito about your case. He will have to listen to me. So, was I right? The snitch! Isn't he? Please... don't help us anymore, we are fucked as it is. While Dad was in prison, life was just fine. Jugoslav made good money from driving licenses and mom worked at the Vet's. We didn't lack anything. But, after release Dad started acting pretty strangely. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Why don't you study? - I have finished it all. - Do something! Tidy up your things! We have to start living like a normal people. Every moment is precious. What is it? You are not doing this under my roof. - Why not? - It's a crime. You could go to prison for that. Is that so? And you are going to tell me. So, why wasn't I sentenced? The judge had your diploma, that's why. Half of the country has your diplomas. They will have to treat you like the apple of their eye, otherwise they are all fucked. Stop it. Jugoslav, don't! You have forged your own certificate. You think I don't know? Is this your signature? Son, I have deserved that. For years I worked on myself. Catching up with all that I missed. Nobody had any complaints. I was an excellent teacher! Remember this, Jugoslav. Your father is the greatest man in Yugoslavia. It is because he didn't have a diploma, that he knew the curriculum better than any professor in any high school. Your father dedicated his whole life to the greatness of this country. If it wasn't for him, the thousands would be without a work and their children would be hungry today. Does he sing to you? Sorry? Janez. Does he sing to you those dirty songs? What are you on? Yes, he does. Then, suddenly Dad got ill. Lajos, the doctor in the village, suspected lung cancer. You know Andjelko, the cancer is at an early stage. The chances of recovery are great. I knew it was not dangerous. If the doctor said so... Only, on his wall is a diploma with my signature. Really? So what? He could still be a good doctor. Wait a bit. If he has a Dad's diploma... - ...then he... - Exactly. He does not know anything! Did you tell him you don't smoke? Does he know that? - He knows. - He is talking rubbish. How could you have a lung cancer if you've never smoked? Shall I take you to Banja Luka to a different doctor? With your license? Shall we go to a friend of mine? He does wonders. "The honest Thief"? No, thank you. Hello, neighbor! How is it? Right. I'm not crazy. I can walk. When did you come out? - Sometime ago. - The family's good? - It's some kind of mistake? - It's not. Look: Comrade Andjelko Milosevic, the primary school "Danko Mitrov", Seskovci. Is there another village called Seskovci in Yugoslavia? No. Is there another primary school in Seskovci? No. Is there, in that school, another Andjelko Milosevic? There isn't. He is writing to you. Let me see what he said. Dear Comrade Andjelko, I have received your correspondence, sent from the correctional institution, concerning the irregularities in the Brkljac Miljenko case. I am prepared to meet with you and hear your arguments, that could be of the great importance... ...in the case of the accused Brkljac Miljenko the Circuit Court in Belgrade. Death to fascism - Freedom to the nations Josip Broz Tito. He is coming here? - No, I'm going there. - To his residency? He is on holiday at Bled. - This is clearly a forgery! - You would know! The envelope is original, it has a watermark, but the name and the address are corrected. It is a bit odd that he wants to meet with you. Someone is really taking a piss out of you, Dad. I am going to Comrade Tito. If you by chance pass by the circus Melano, look out for Bora III. I will. Tell him to say hello to that girl from me. - What girl? - He will know. He introduced us, when he hypnotized me. Don't worry. I'll tell him. It will make her happy. What is she like? Is she pretty? Very. Surely the most beautiful girl in the world. That was the last time I saw our father. He caught the train that same evening and went to Slovenia. From there on, he disappeared. I arrived to Bled Lake a month after he disappeared. Went to the police, looked in all the places that I could think of. Everybody was acting dumb, as if they never heard of him. I suspect that Dad, after arriving on Bled, went straight to the Tito's residency. Tired from the journey, he probably hoped to sleep there, but they didn't welcome him with open arms. Where are you going? I have a letter from Comrade Tito... - What letter?! - Miljenko Brkljac is... - Get out of here! - Let me explain... Get lost! But Dad was not someone to give up easily. He probably wandered around the residency until he thought of something. If one can't get there by land, use a waterways. Comrade Tito! I finally found you! You know, that young Miljenko, he didn't do anything... - They set him up with the explosive... - Who are you? - It was his brother Vinko... - But who are you?! Comrade Tito is not feeling well! I wondered for years what might had happened there. Most probably it was a case of unlucky circumstances. Seems like that the bullet meant for my father had hit no one else but Tito. Help! As I said, Dad has long disappeared. What's more, Tito's death was never announced. His double appeared, his spitting image who was, some said, a Pole or a Russian. That impostor carried on going around the world, greeting the most important people. Only a few people knew that he was an impostor. I found out the truth from Bora III, when I met him in Bitola while I was in army service. It's really warm. The sun is burning. Really hot. You are sweating, all sticky. In front of you is a pool full of crystal clear water... There I found the girl with the almond colored eyes again. Together, we carried on looking for my father. And I will look for him until the day that I die. I know, if I don't find him in this world, full of lies and dishonesty, I'll find him in the other, the real one. In the world that is not a forgery.
