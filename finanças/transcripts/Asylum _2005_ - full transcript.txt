[Low, mysterious theme fades in] [melancholy orchestral theme playing] [melancholy theme fades out] [slow piano theme playing] [piano theme fades out] [melancholy orchestral theme playing] [glass shards crunching] We should get this repaired. Mmm. I'm going to bed. Good night. I'll be up soon. Now, it gives me great pleasure to welcome our new deputy superintendent, Dr. Max Raphael. WOMAN: Welcome onboard. And we also welcome his wife Stella and their fine young fellow Charlie. [Crowd clapping and murmuring] And we wish you many contented years here among the confined and confused. I refer, of course, to the present company, not to the patients. [Crowd laughing] [indistinct chattering] Thank you. It was very kind of you. Not at all. Please forgive the latecomer. Rather delicate moment with our new matricide. Ah. Did I miss anything? Only Jack's speech. Perfect timing. [Chuckling] Peter, I'd like to introduce you to Mrs. Raphael. Oh, yes, of course. I'm so sorry. Peter Cleave. How do you do? Stella Raphael. Peter is our longest- serving doctor here. I'm fixtures and fittings. [All chuckling] Forgive me, I need that sausage. Excuse me. Ha, ha, ha. What's your field, Dr. Cleave? Oh, Peter, please. I tend to deal with the extreme cases. My particular interest sexual pathology and its associated catastrophes. What does your wife make of that? She doesn't. I'm not. I spend my life immersed in the passions of others. Dangerous sport, love. Not sure I have the stomach for it. I've been married for 12 years. I'm not sure I've ever thought of it as a sport. Oh, well, marriage is a different beast entirely. I'm talking about passion. MAX: What did Cleave have to say for himself? STELLA: This and that. I rather liked him. [Charlie mimicking plane] Trust me, he's got fangs. Who has? Count Dracula. [Charlie growls] He wanted my job. Thought he deserved it for his years of loyalty. Why didn't you speak to any of the other wives? There wasn't time. But I'm so looking forward to our coffee mornings. You will involve yourself in the life of the hospital. It's expected. Of course. Now, the band. I thought last year's was splendid, agreed? Yes, but can we have some slower numbers this time? I've only just recovered. It was exhausting. [Laughing] Rebook the band, subject to slowies. Show of hands. Carried. Next. Do I have any takers for the cake? Stella, would you like to commandeer the fruitcake? Oh, I'd be honored. Lovely. And, if you'll forgive the reminder, no liqueur. Alcohol, dear. Alcohol for the patients, verboten. [Indistinct chattering] [metal door clangs shut] [running footsteps] WOMAN: Help me! Help me! Help me, help me! Help me! [Woman shouting indistinctly] [woman screaming, attendants shouting] Are you joining us? No, I'm not. No-- It's this way. No. But you're not allowed in the corridor! Come back! You're going the wrong way! Oh! I'm so sorry. No, no. No. No harm done. Thank you. I don't mean to nanny, but it might be wise to restrict yourself to the public areas of the hospital. One never quite knows what one might find. Do the male and female patients ever mix? Oh, yes, of course. At the annual hospital ball. The perfect opportunity to mingle. Believe me, once a year is ample. Can I give you a hand, Mrs. Bain? No. Thank you, Mrs. Raphael. How did my predecessor fill her days? Heh. She sewed. Tapestry. One year, she did all the hospital, seen from above. Mummy! Come and see! What, darling? Come and see! [Shovel scraping] Edgar, this is my mother. We've invented a test of strength. Will you time us? I-- I don't have my watch on, darling. Just count, then. Ready? And lift. Go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-- Put him down. Oh, sorry. Didn't see you there, Mrs. Raphael. [Clears throat] Come on, Charlie. Thank you, Mrs. Bain. Charlie's made a new friend. That man doing the glasshouse. Oh, good. Is he safe? He wouldn't be in our garden if he wasn't. Working is a privilege. It can take years to earn it. They've all been fully vetted. Is he one of yours? No. Cleave's. His favorite, I think. Favorite? It's not unusual to have a pet patient. Who's yours? You. [Pages turning] Why is Peter Cleave so taken with him? Oh, you know him. Fancies himself an aesthete, and the fellow used to be a sculptor. What did he do? Heads, I think. No, I meant-- I know what you meant. I interviewed him myself. Charlie is perfectly safe. Hello. I'm sorry about the other day. I hope you didn't get into trouble. No more than I'm in already, Mrs. Raphael. [Glass shatters] [slow instrumental theme playing] My husband tells me you were a sculptor. I still am. May I ask how long you've been here? You may. STELLA: And? Six years. I killed my wife. She betrayed me. [Suspenseful orchestral theme playing] Mrs. Raphael. [Door opens] What have you done to him? Mrs. Raphael! He was climbing a tree. [Gasps] He fell. Can Edgar stay for tea? I'm afraid he can't. He, uh-- I've got to get back to work, Charlie. Thanks. [Bells tolling] How is he? He's fine, thank you. I don't think he'll be climbing any trees just yet. Oh, I don't know. Not my position, but... I reckon he's an adventurer. You might be right. Suppose he gets that from you. I doubt it. Must be your husband, then. Interesting dress. Was that a compliment? Yes. Might it be a touch too revealing, given the occasion? I'll mention it to my dressmaker. What a good idea. [Band playing Holzmann's "Blaze Away"] United front. [Laughter, indistinct chattering] ["Blaze Away" ends] [band plays James Fieldhouse's "Clock Tower Cha Cha"] I apologize for the cut in. ["Clock Tower Cha Cha" ends] [band plays James Fieldhouse's "Stella's Waltz"] Will you dance with me? Yes. [Quietly] May I have the pleasure? [Humming softly] Can you keep a secret? Depends what it is. Jack told me he's planning to retire next year. I wonder who he's recommending as his successor. Would it be someone I know? It would. Is it Peter Cleave? [Chuckles] Very droll. Congratulations. That's wonderful news. It'll be a huge commitment for both of us. I know it's not exactly ideal here for you and Charlie, but it'll change. We'll have that house, and a garden. We'll be able to settle. Thank you for dancing with me. I can't take those. You could take what they mean. Hello, Mr. Archer. Edgar. [Melancholy piano theme playing] Break over! [Muffled] Yah! [Mysterious orchestral theme playing] [lipstick tube clinks] [fabric tears] [grunts] [grunting] [groans] [panting] [mysterious theme fades out] MAN: Wait, wait. We'll help you with that. [Suspenseful orchestral theme playing] [panting] Oh! Where's it gone? It's down there. [Moaning softly] [suspenseful theme fades out] How are you finding Mrs. Raphael? I don't have much to do with her. I'm busy with my work. But, uh, Mr. Archer tells me of your recent interest in horticulture. She's kind to me. I gave her some flowers a few weeks ago. And you danced with her. Only to show you I can behave myself with a woman. I don't doubt it. You're... pleased with my progress? I'm not here to judge you. But, yes, you're progressing as one would want. And, in time... work duties lead to my release? Have patience, Edgar. We still have many mountains to climb. I've always done everything you've asked. Indeed. But that does not make you ready for the world. But you've cured me. Of what, exactly? Severe personality disorder... with features of morbid jealousy. Continue... with your work, and we'll continue to take a view. [Chair scrapes floor] Any news on the job? You'll be the first to know. Stella behaving herself? Yes, Mother. That fellow's done wonders with your glasshouse. Yes, it's scrubbed up rather well, hasn't it? JACK: Our rockery resembles Berlin in '45. [All chuckling] Perhaps you can pass him over to us. I think it was my imagination, but isn't he rather attractive? It's your imagination. He is attractive. Did he do something rather nasty? He murdered his wife. JACK: Obviously sane. Can't think why we got him. [All chuckling] What will happen to him? I've got-- I've no idea. That's Peter's department. I suspect he'll be overhauling rockeries for a good few years to come. [All chuckling] Here's to locking the door and throwing away the key. What the hell is wrong with you? You had no right to say that! The way he casually dismissed that man's whole future, it was sickening. Policy is not your concern. I thought the policy was to reform. It's none of your bloody business! Is it really so difficult to behave? Like the other wives? Like the other little ladies? [Gasps] Frankly, yes. Bye, Mrs. Bain. Behave yourself, Charlie. [Car doors close, engine starts] [melancholy piano theme playing] MAN: Look here. Here. Here, let me show you. [Door opens] [melancholy orchestral theme playing] [whispers] Not here. Shh. Oh, no! [Door bangs open] I just had a bath. Your point being? I forgot my checkbook. Oh. Where did you last see it? Well, I don't know, do I? [Suspenseful theme playing] Here it is! Here we go, young man. Let's go to the zoo. Shall we do that first? And then we can go into the shop in London... [Brenda continues speaking indistinctly] [buzzer sounding] [gardeners conversing indistinctly] [dramatic theme playing] [dramatic theme fades out] [melancholy piano theme playing] Are you all right? Have you seen a ghost? What's the matter, darling? There was a patient. What patient? Where? In the house. He-- He might have been in Mummy's bedroom. [Brakes screech] [horn honks] Who was he? Do you know him? [Suspenseful theme playing] [gasps] [door opens] Can I use your phone, please? Is everything all right? [Rotary dial turns] [alarm sirens wailing] It's been suggested that... your dealings with Edgar Stark went... beyond propriety. Suggested by who? John Archer. And there have been whispers among the patients. These rumors soon get back to me. Naturally, I give them no credence, but... I do need to know why they might have arisen. Stella talked to Stark in the garden. She talks to many of the patients. What of it? Stella? Charlie was fond of him, so of course I spoke to him occasionally. You danced with him at the ball. I danced with you too. [Guards conversing indistinctly] I'm afraid it's true. My God. Does Max know? I suspect so. It's a bloody catastrophe! The home office will be apoplectic. And in my last year. Doubtless they'll require a head to roll. Well, they're not having mine! Did you never think the man might try to escape? Of course not! Otherwise, I would have prevented it. You were right about Max. He's not for us. Appalling, bloody stupid woman! She practically chauffeured the man out of the door! As for the wife, never in 40 years... He obviously has no control over her. Who'll be her next prey, for God's sake? He'll have to go. May I suggest that we don't toss that particular bone to the press? At least, not yet. You'll be crucified in the papers as it is. They love a madman on the loose. We must preserve the integrity of the hospital for the future. Peter, when the inspector arrives, do you think we can play down the more lurid aspects of Stark's recent activities? Oh, naturally. BRIDIE: Do you--? Do you think Stella helped him to escape? Unwittingly. She was manipulated. I suspect she's fallen in love with him. You're fixated. That's why you passed him fit for work when you knew he was unstable. Oh, drivel. Your wife destabilized him. One could hardly have predicted that element of the equation. I assume you're acting as Jack's factotum sent to extract my resignation? Spare us the grandiosity. Just get on with your work and keep quiet. I might remind you that I'm your superior. In what sense? [Birds chirping] [clock bells ring] [clock bells ringing in distance] [coughing] How long? You were supposed to time me. I'm sorry, darling. If they catch him, will he be in trouble? I don't think they will catch him. He's been gone too long. I think he's on a boat, sailing back to Australia. [Slow, melancholy piano theme playing] [leaves crunching] I think you should come and talk to me. Unofficially, of course. Let me help you. [Phone rings] I might go up to town tomorrow and do some early Christmas shopping. Something for me? Wait and see. [Suspenseful theme playing] [suspenseful theme fades out] I'm Nick. It was me on the phone. Why were you so late? Had to be sure you weren't followed. How do you know him? I was his assistant. Before. [Soft, mysterious theme playing] [suspenseful theme building] [door creaks loudly] [suspenseful theme ends] Did you think I'd abandoned you? I couldn't contact you till it was safe. And it's safe now? [Soft piano theme playing] [door opens] How was London? Busy. I saw something for you, but they didn't have your size. I have to go and collect it next week. [Soft, melancholy theme playing] Successful trip? Mm. Did you find what you were after? Yes, finally. Where is it? Hmm? Your shopping. The shopping you did in London. Where is it? It's for Christmas. I've hidden it. Where? If I told you, it wouldn't be hidden. Show me what you bought. [Shouts] Show me, damn you! Happy Christmas. Forgive me. [Soft, melancholy theme playing] [zips skirt] [zips] Does he suspect? He's buried in his work. Do you share a bed? I'm yours. So don't go back to him. Come and live with me. I can't just leave my family. Yes, you can. Give them up or don't come back. Once you're here, we'll find a way to bring Charlie too. Please. I can't share you. Decide. How is Edgar? What on earth do you mean? Your housekeeper let slip you're taking regular trips to London. You're seeing him, aren't you? If you knew women, you'd know they like to shop occasionally. Don't delude yourself you're in love with a tortured genius. He's a failed artist, infinitely more dangerous both to you and himself. He's mine, and he needs my help. Evidently he disagrees. You should know what he did to his wife. I don't need to know. I have nothing to do with the man. He beat her death with a hammer and then decapitated her. He took a scalpel and cut out her eyes and then he hacked at her face as if it were clay. Perhaps there won't be any more trips to London. Perhaps your mental state is too fragile. With Max's consent, we can hold you here. Nonsense. Oh, but we can. For your own safety, of course. Stella... tell me where he is. [Ominous theme playing] CHARLIE: Mrs. B? How do you spell "amoeba"? With a dictionary, my dear. Don't ask me. I got the brain of an amoeba. [Laughs] [door creaks] She's... She's having a little holiday. I'm sure she'll be back very soon. Shall I read to you? Has she gone to Australia? "That was Tom's great secret, "the scheme to return home with his brother pirates "and attend their own funerals. "They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday..." [Big Mama Thornton and Johnny Ace's "Yes, Baby" playing] THORNTON: * Well, I love you, Daddy * Want you by my side STELLA: Can I move, please? EDGAR: Shh! * Yes, Daddy Want you by my side * I've got pins and needles. * Yeah, baby She taught me lots of things. She's a black Caribbean. [Laughing] Have you had a black woman? No, you haven't. I have. I knew that. Some piece of ass. I was very drunk, but, you know... [laughs] I couldn't quite do the same with her. She taught me a lot of things. ACE: * Yeah, now, baby * Oh, darlin' * Yes, babe * I love you, baby Take it off. * Yes, babe * Yes, darlin' * Tell me now * Oh, sweetheart * Yes, babe * I love you, baby * Hey, now I'm working! [Clay plopping on table] I'm going for a walk, all right? Be careful. [People chattering indistinctly] [boys speaking indistinctly] [cap guns popping] Thank you. Are you following me? No. What, you just like hanging around in markets? Have you any reason not to trust me? So why have me followed? It won't happen again. Sorry. Why don't you trust me? I said, I'm sorry. I'm working. You're always working. It's just like being with my husband. [Sculpture thuds against floor] Is it? Yes. Like being with your husband, is it? Yes. Just like home? Yes! Is this like he was like? Yes. Like this? [Stella gasping softly] Hey! Look at that! Wonderful! Wonderful! [Titus Turner's "My Lonely Room" playing] * Aaaaah! The paint is peelin'... * Tell me. I miss Charlie. * Off the wall It's all right. Don't be sad. * The floor is as cold As it can be * * But as I lay here * Hummin' a tune * I'm goin' crazy * In my lonely room * I'm goin' to the doctor... I love you. It doesn't matter, but I do. No, you don't. I do. I love him too. Happy Christmas, Stella. [Groans] You touch her again, I'll fuckin' kill you! All right? [People conversing indistinctly] Please stay, Nick. I'm gonna clear out my stuff before he gets back. There's no point in arguing. It's not my place, but, uh... ...maybe you should come with me. He-- He's turning. I-I've seen it before. With his wife? I saw the body. Please don't stay here. [Soft, suspenseful theme playing] [door creaks] I thought you'd been caught. Is that what you want? No, of course not. Are you missing your comforts? No. You were going to Nick. Are you going to start hitting me now? [Sighs] I love you. [Whispers] I love you. [Melancholy romantic theme playing] [people conversing indistinctly] [tapping on glass] [hoarsely] He needs help. Can you find a doctor? I'll see what I can do. [Sniffles] [gasping breaths] I saw you together. You're fucking him. No. [Groans] [sobbing] [blade scraping] Eat. When my wife took her lovers, she tried to poison me. Eat. [Grinds apple against teeth] [bites apple] [crunching] [tap dripping] You've checked those clothes? I think they beat it. [Footsteps] [dramatic suspense theme playing] Mrs. Raphael. Let's go. [Lock turns] You'll be released in the morning. Could I see Charlie? You're aware I could prevent you from having any further contact with him? But he needs you. You'll see him tomorrow. Thank you. [Grunts softly] REPORTER 1: How do you both feel to be reunited? REPORTER 2: Mr. Raphael, this way, please, sir. OFFICER: Let us through, please. Thank you. Mr. Raphael, do you have any comment? [Low, melancholy theme playing] There's a blanket in the back, if you want to sleep. It's a long journey. Where are we going? Wales. What? Wales. North Wales. Sheep, tractors and a genetic hatred of the English. Once it got in the papers, I was dismissed. I managed to get a position at a local hospital. Jack fired you? No. His successor. [Suspenseful, mysterious theme playing] [whispers] You asleep? Are you better now? I'll never go away again. I promise. I'm very, very sorry. Thank you for letting me see him. A stronger man would have let you rot. You're strong. Don't be trite. I wasn't strong enough to keep you. [Sighs] Good night. Good night. [Dog barking] A little word of advice Don't let your shame degenerate into self-pity. It seldom helps. Settled in all right? Walking, are you? [Barks] [school bell rings] Charlie. [Children conversing indistinctly] Mom! GRIFFIN: Come on. Come on in, Charlie. You all right? Thank you. We can't live like this. Please come back to us. Please. [Phone ringing] Excuse me. [People conversing indistinctly] Hello? EDGAR [faintly]: ...Dr. Raphael. Oh, speak up, will you? This line's atrocious. Yes. Yes. Could you tell me where? Yes, Wales. Do you have his address? Well, I don't have an address. Only the hospital, Cledwyn General. Could you repeat that, please? Cledwyn. Where's that? Oh! Well, I have no idea. Ask a policeman. Claudia, who is it? An old colleague of Dr. Raphael's. He's a mumbler. May I? Please. Who is this? Hello? Edgar? PETER [on phone]: Are you expecting the police? Yes, they're here already. If he comes for her? I wouldn't like to say what he'd do. You've put her on medication, I assume? She doesn't need it. She's fine. GIRL: Bye, Mr. Griffin. See you. Good girl. Goodbye. Bye, Gayle. Bye, Dolly. Goodbye. Bye, Orlaith. Bye, Charlie. Bye, Mr. Griffin. See you tomorrow. There's a school field trip next week. Are parents allowed to come? If you need me, I'll be upstairs. I've just got to finish something. Here. Parents are allowed on the field trip. I told a lie. Well, everyone lies occasionally. Good for telling me. Would you like some company? Well, I don't think I'm busy next week. [Conversing indistinctly] [suspenseful, mysterious theme playing] I know you long for him. But you won't see him again. You know that, don't you? Yes. We'll be a family again. Like before. In time, this will be what you want. [Glass shatters] [car horn beeps] Hurry, darling. We mustn't keep Daddy waiting. [Phone ringing] Hello? Where's Mummy? Phone rang. [Honks horn] Sorry. Who was it? Mr. Griffin. Instructions for our field trip. Inspector. Good morning, Dr. Raphael. It's good of you to help out. [Gasps] You came. Let's go. I can't leave Charlie again. I promised him. I'll never stop loving you. Where is he? At school. We'll go and get him. Take him with us. [Footsteps] [gasps] [dramatic theme playing] No! [Engine starts] He's gone. [Shouts] Now let him go! * Six green bottles Hanging on the wall * * Six green bottles Hanging on the wall * * And if one green bottle Should accidentally fall * * There'll be five green bottles Hanging on the wall * * Five green bottles Hanging on the wall * * Five green... [parents and children conversing indistinctly] If I can have your attention, please. Children, don't forget to collect items of interest in your jam jars. Now, uh, if you could form yourselves into groups, please. At least one adult in each. There we go. Okay, one, two, there we go. Thanks, Mrs. Jones. There we are. There we are, Mrs. Raphael. Well done, Charlie. CHARLIE: I'm going to catch a fish. STELLA: Won't you need a rod? I'm hoping a small one will swim into my jar. Do you know fish can only remember things for eight seconds? [Soft, ominous piano theme playing] Ah! [Charlie gasping] Mrs. Raphael! Mrs. Raphael, do something! [Muffled] Do something! [Gasps] [grunts] [Stella wails] [delicate piano theme playing] WOMAN: Thank you so much. JACK: Questionable circumstances. [Mourners conversing indistinctly] Excuse me. Excuse me. Jack. Jack? You must come and visit me soon. Maybe next summer. Mm. So kind of you to deal with all this. Poor Max. Oh, the least I could do. Max is in complete agreement. Of course, I had to arrange things for the home office. It was a little bit sticky, but we got there. Well, arranging things is your forte, isn't it, Peter? Goodbye, my dear. Well... shall I keep you informed? I don't want to know. Oh, my dear. BRENDA: Peter and I just wanted to thank you... BRIDIE: I'm so sorry, dear Max. Oh... [sobbing] I want you to understand what's going to happen next. The shock will wear off, and it will be replaced by devastating grief. In time, you'll come to terms with what you've done, and you'll just be very, very sad. And that sadness will stay with you for the rest of your life. PETER: Good evening. NURSE: Good evening. Come, now. Good girl. Where's Charlie? Where's my picture of Charlie? With your belongings. You mean, I can't see him? Not yet. Because I killed him, didn't I? Come on. Just lie down. [Whimpering] Is Edgar here? Of course not. Where is he? The past, Stella. He's in the past. Good afternoon. If you won't speak, I can't treat you. Do you want to stay in solitary forever? Talk. [Shouts] Say something! Express your contempt. She's here. She's been here six weeks. She's my patient. Why? Something terrible. The boy drowned. Yes, you were fond of him. Would you like to see her? Speak. [Hinges creak, door slams shut] Thank you. Did you do as I asked, to think rigorously about what it means to love? I'm beginning to understand that it was never real. That it was all an obsession. [Writing on pad] Can you define your feelings for him? I have none. It's over. It ended when Charlie died. If I told you he was here, in the hospital? Well, I suppose it would be logical if he were. The question was hypothetical. You've been very brave these past weeks. Thank you, Peter. Oh, I see you've got a flat tire. Mm. I don't need a car. Oh. Not for work? I've resigned. Oh. I think I might go into teaching. I'm-- I might be quite good with children. Yes. Good idea. What do you want from me? [Knock on door] Come. Ah, welcome. Thank you, nurse. Would you like a drink? I usually have one about now. I'd love one. Yes. The usual? Your old usual, should I say? [Glasses clinking] To your health. Yesterday I went to see Max. I made a suggestion with which he concurred. My contacts at the home office might well release you from here were I to guarantee your continued... treatment and safety. What I mean to say is that... were you to live with me, in my house, these conditions would most likely be satisfied. I can offer you a fine home and a decent life. Traveling, art, gardening and so on. But I'm still married to Max. He wants to divorce you. Oh. You're a very dark horse. Well, I assure you this is not my usual procedure with patients. It's something that rather crept up on me. It would be arrogant to suggest that you might love me. But I believe you need me at present and perhaps in time, this need might grow into love of some variety. Are you a passionate man, Peter? I think that's something you'd have to discover. What would she want with an old queen like you? Ah, we have dialogue. I'm disappointed. I thought you wanted me. You resent it, don't you? That she might find happiness with someone else? I wondered... if you might like this. Oh, Peter. Thank you. It's beautiful. It was my mother's. Shall we? Here. The ladies were discussing the hospital ball. Oh. Would you like to attend? I'm not sure. Well, it might be difficult for you. Memories and so on. You'll be there? Well, of course. Yes, that's true. Will Edgar be there? If we're to be married, Peter, let's not have lies. You knew he was here? I heard talk, and I know you. You wouldn't give up on a patient. I thought it might be traumatic for you. I would have told you in time. Forgive me. Of course. And to answer your question, he'll be at the dance. Unless you wish otherwise. Whatever you think... is best. It might be useful for his recovery to see you've moved on, as it were. You'll fail her. He did. I did. So will you. Perspective. We can work with that. Cleave? Will you let me see her? Please? The hospital ball might be an opportunity. Cooperate in your treatment... and we'll see. [Band turning instruments] [people conversing indistinctly] [band playing upbeat jazz] [Peter clears throat] You look magnificent. You look very dashing yourself. I remember that dress. I'm amazed it still fits. Will you dance with me later? That would be lovely. [Band playing Holzmann's "Blaze Away"] Ah. [Band plays James Fieldhouse's "Stella's Waltz"] Stella. Shall we? Oh, by the way. I went to fetch Edgar and he was asleep. I woke him and he said that he'd changed his mind and didn't want to come. [Sobbing] [people conversing indistinctly] [soft, melancholy piano theme playing] [ring clinking on floor] Leave... me... alone. [Slow, mournful theme playing] [table tennis ball ricochets, people conversing indistinctly] [mournful theme fades out] [pulsing, dramatic theme playing] [dramatic theme softens, grows melancholy] [melancholy theme fades out] [mysterious, suspenseful theme playing] [mysterious theme fades out]
