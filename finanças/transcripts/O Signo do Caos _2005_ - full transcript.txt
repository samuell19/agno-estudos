BOLDLY... PRESENTS THE SIGN OF CHAOS The ANTI-FILM featuring and introducing Guest Stars Directed and produced by Did you bring water? Faster! Faster! What do you want now, man? Hold it! Stupid, stupid... There are limits, you know! You're not worth the junk you eat! What never leaves a suitcase...? The handle! - Whistling is forbidden here! - Take it easy! Brazil is ours. Keep quiet, you buffoon! I feel a strong weakness! A bird only survives without water when stuffed. That won't make a living. Won't fill your belly. - Excuse me. - Come in. Let's get right to the point, without delay-ay. Well, in little time he succeeded in showing what kind of figure he was. Crazy enough to transform himself into the slum's champion! But who does he think he is? The king of the world? He must be destroyed at once. Whatever the damned circumstances. However, his mental weakness doesn't just end with this here at hand, showing his tendency to stir up a hornets' nest. We were lucky that they filmed in vain. Everything has its price, including fame. Take care, my son. Or rather, don't take care and no hard feelings at the nearest rubbish dump. And no hard feelings, okay! - Well, boss... - Yes? I must go home now and serve my cat its dinner. It must be hungry by now. It's the price of fame! Well, well...! I'm going to do a cesarean on that guy and get the king out. I'll open up Brazil's belly to see what's inside. I'll commit parricide! Not parricide, as the Press and Propaganda Department is the child's father, "sonicide" would be better. Not even "sonicide". "Cinemacide". Brazil's the father of the stillborn child, Cinemacide. - A toast! To us! - To us! Cinemacide! Cinemacide! Cinemacide! Come on, open up this door! If we just stand here waiting, it'll never open up. If I could, I'd break it down right now! No, we're not paying for the damage! Open up this door! Leave it to me. All Brazilians should be forbidden to exist! No need. They're born punished... and die even worse! Above all, without even knowing why. The image of chaos is chaos itself. Collect all the material. But what in hell! What are we actually looking for, boss? Anything incriminating against that trouble-maker. We need a scapegoat, dead or alive. Right, and nothing less. Well incriminate the bastard for rust and anything else. Let's collect all this material. A load of rusty cans? The rusty bastard gets away with anything. The beastly ambitions of that gringo! Looks like he's got a screw loose. Stupid fellow! The dumb will be struck by lightning! Time we used our heads. The top or the bottom one, boss? All three dumb scum! The showing is set for 11 o'clock. - What time is it? - My belly says lunchtime. Start with the left hand projector. Boss, the one that doesn't work properly? The one with the shaky picture. - The lame one! - The lame one. - The film will snap. - So what? - Boss... - What do you want? I'd like to know... What has this gringo done that's so wrong? - Everything! - Foreigners are tourists. The great hero. He screwed up and will be screwed. He's out of the official program. He did what he wanted and this is the result. This very day, we declare war on the genius. We can throw it off sugarloaf-mountain! Great! This film will never be judged. Keep your anxiety to yourself or I'll call the police. In fact, Brazilian cinema has always been a police case. You can't feed kids on sour grapes! The first days of the latest art. Let's get cinema out of the toy cupboard. The more I pray, the more haunted I feel. The truth is no one knows the truth. That's the truth. And truth hides itself. Passion blinds. I close my eyes to see. The worst blindman is the one that doesn't want to see. The worst deaf who won't hear. In blindman's land, is the capital of Brazil. And that Brazil is a country of blacks. But it still is the country of the future, they say... Why this silence? Let's check out the rest of carnival. They tell marvels in Technicolor All these colored costumes, well only see after next year's carnival. And "The Raft"! A real mess! Never seen such a mess! It's not brainwashing. It's soul washing! I feel like a fool. Well, nonsense. It's pretty hard stuff to swallow! What's this? The man's a genius. He's 50 years ahead of any other director. He did everything before anybody else. To be kept 50 years on a shelf, in the freezer, in limbo. What do you suggest, then? Show it on the wall of an infected public toilet Or otherwise cut, cut... Or just leave it. This is a more explosive mixture than the "Berlin Samba", by the way, the only reasonable thing that poor bastard ever did, the arrogant imprudent! What hell is that? - The extras from the slums. - They don't look like extras. They're authentic slum-dwellers. But what about the great black orchestras and the great samba singers? They may be all you want, except musicians! Look here, they?re not extras. They're actors. A dollar a day. My God! He's gone too far! This burdensome joke is no part of the civilized world! - Boss? - Yes! There's someone to see you, waiting outside. Keep him waiting. I'm not in for anyone. I actually don't like knowing people I don't know. The Vargases don't forgive, but they forget. The nation is weary of such rags and tatters. Not worth a pamphlet. Not even a flurry thin dime. Coarse! Coarse so very weak. Very, very weak. Absurd that a man can earn dollars and commit such imprudence as this, filming a film without any structure. Impossible! Total madness! They are extremely poetic images. I can't take so much poetry, my boy. The most beautiful part is what is most hidden. What do you mean to say by that? Cinema is like an ocean, not like a drop of water. Any need for so much water? It's not worth watching. If it's not worth watching, then life's not worth living! Really? Which of these lies do you want me to believe? All of them. Or none. The best thing is to wait. We'll wait. Go on with the projection! That was all, except for the best part. I realize it's not easy to understand a genius, I know. But he surpassed me. Only he could. This goes too far! The most expensive flower of poverty. Even free, it still is expensive. Won't even pay the film poster. Not worth a cent. Don't measure genius by using pygmy measurements. Who told you that? Your local popcorn seller? The best filmmaker of the Press and Propaganda Department: Primo Carbonari! Ah, Primo mangiare, doppo filosofare... Whatever blows up your skirt... There's still a lot ahead! The limbo bar's still quite high! The devils not as ugly he's painted. Rabbits tail, knock on wood three times! Rabbits tail, knock on wood three times! And God deliver us from the devils of such caliber! Mend this shit! It's rubbish, worthless! A one-sided, tough fight! As if we weren't on the same team. Don't try to put your anxieties on my shoulders. Actually the film is more real than reality. Will you stop that! Don't do that to me now. This here is shameful! Take it away, out of my sight! What kind of joke is this? Is this cinema, or just a load of shit? He earns in dollars and makes believe he films. - This man is useless, boy. - You don't know what culture is. Is this the image of a country? Show a bunch of niggers dancing the samba? Who's going to want this, for God's sake? Let's go, boys! Even free it's still expensive. Won't even pay the ink for the poster! Worthless! "The Rafts" is also a load of devils shit, with no story, no actors no stars, not even lighting equipment. Put on the lights. The best way-out is the Santos Dumont airport. Tom Jobim, flying, just for flying. What has this to do with me? Oh my friend, the last one turns off the lights. To and fro. To and fro. To and fro. To and fro. I can't see. See for yourself. I'd never set foot in a country like that. Very well, you're beautiful. Fabulous photos. This you can get anywhere. No need to be cinema. Our eyes don't lie and life goes on, the same way. Even if not, it's no big deal. An absurd! Horrible! It's unbearable! It's forged and dodgy. As you can see, it's dull and unbearable. Look! Try to see, try to see... It means nothing. Very commonplace, it's not cinema! It's nonsense. Nonsense. Less than a film... Bullshit! Contra productive. A bit of this and that. Overdose, my friend! You can't make films like that. - Forget it! - What's this? Dock lights. Strip-joint neon. Less than amateur I will never get enough of it. Look at the chest. Marvelous! Magnificent Splendorous! Weak! This is prejudice and prejudice is not the same as ideas. Really? Leave it on the shelf for 50 years and I bet no one will miss it. Enough! This is magic! I'll bet one to a billion. You talk too much and without any understanding. And there's something else, I'll tell you... You're not going to tell me anything. Stay calm, like me... I'm calm. Otherwise... - What? - The seventh art. I hate them all! I refuse to support this veto He had no credit nor guilt. The crime of intention. Forget the rest. My advisers, as a surprise for my dear friends, we have been waiting endlessly and nothing happens. It goes beyond all limits. Let's be cautious with this citizen. It's a revolting and pestilent film. You force me to tell the truth. What is this, after all? A new position for Citizen Kama Sutra. "?a suffit!" It makes me want to throw everything into the sea! It's decided. Into the sea! All this material into the sea! Understood. We won't allow this negative view to be shown throughout the world. Chaos and crisis. A very dodgy piece of work See for yourself. Rather than remember all, it's better to forget Let's see, for instance, the man reaches the shadow. My thoughts would fill a cinemateque. Several! Where they will never be shown. A "pederasteque". Shame! Shame! A revolting and disgusting I'm sure you saw very little, Mr. Amnesium... I have no courage to see the rest. Won't you watch the rest, boss? We need to see... Don't ask me to watch it, I won't do it. See? Look, nothing happens. They're all stock still. It's forbidden to whistle here! It's total chaos! No fear for other torpedoes that can harm him and sink the career he's won inch by inch. Until when? Until when? As far as I Know, no one in this country has noticed. Impossible! The world shook several times because of that human hurricane. The end is near in terms of nowadays moral zoology. A madman is mad. An imbecile is something else. This is no good. Less than amateur. That's your opinion, Mr. Amnesium. Why is it you can't understand we have to stop stupidity? - Nonsense;. - Is it? Worse than useless. Like teaching a joke to a deaf parrot. You know nothing. That's your opinion. For everyone's sake, delete it. Slapstick. I vote that the film be released. Cut some scenes, or I veto! Your intransigence won't stop people from seeing it. See or not to see. That is the question. This veto will pass under your responsibility. What right do you have to veto a work of art? It's awful and no one should see it. Everyone's heard of the madman Orson sleeping peacefully surrounded by thieves. Go for it! Madness has taken over this other-worldly envoy. It's all canceled for now and ever! I hope... Shameful injustice! False freedom! Please withdraw. I have serious and more important appointments. A veto "ad eternum" is the least. Presumption! I'll show you the first 3 reels. There is a primary error in them. You discover it. Come on, boys! We will not allow it to be taken abroad. Show me the error and then... I also want no more complaints from the offended and oppressed. It's worthless. I bet a million to one. Amazing! Each scene gives fright. It's a waste of time. It makes no sense. Waste of time. Better not to approve it Boss? You already know? Best to ignore it... What's this? Leave it. Take your paw off! You can see this anywhere. No need for a film. It doesn't fit in. I don't see how, young man. - Bullshit! - Impossible! It must have taken all of him! More than you can see! It?s all a kind of theorem, a puzzle. Head breaking! He wanted to film like Shakespeare, his basic reference. If only I could kill my memory with crossword puzzles. This is nofilm. Parrot! Parrot! In those days, it was all done secretly, right? Art in Brazil has no future, boy! Without any doubt. I fully agree. They spend money like water. - And always short. - Look... Anyone makes films nowadays. Or think they do. Everybody knows no one ever watches these pseudo films. No one ever has. Recommended for those who suffer from insomnia. You know who you?re talking to, old man? Didn't I tell you? The rottenest fruit of human presumption. - A true masterpiece! - A work of art! Merit has nothing to do with it. Even if so, it's no big deal. I only wanted to take out the suffering. So it would pass more quickly. What for? For what reason? So it would pass more quickly. Get rid of this film-horror. I want to tell all of you that in a poor man's houthere is no need for apologies. Let's remove this stain off our national civilization! That human hurricane! He couldn't stop creating. He won't have another chance. This film is like a bottle of sparkling mineral water. It's refreshing, sparkles but I prefer champagne! Just fizz! This is an offense to human nature. From now on, only civilized films will be released in this country! Wholesome, rich and costly! So we don't look bad abroad. Let's go, boys! This is all very good and excellent, but it all goes to the dump. This is not cinema at all! Come here sweetheart. Don't get offended! - I'll bring that ring. - Pink... Okay, boss. As you gentlemen know, all those who focus on poverty with other interior guilty. Ulterior motives. We can't innovate in this case. You seem to think with your feet! Don't put your foot in it! Think with your toe nails And put all four feet in it! A smut in the eye of humanity... I'll tell if I want it shown again. It's giving me a hell of a headache. It's a friggin' obnoxious film, Instead of our NBC - nice, beautiful and cheap, they've given us CBS, cheap, black and sluts. Don't lose your sleep over it. Real black magic dolls! Well stuffed! Unswallowable! Scum of the earth from start to finish. Pity it's still at the start. I veto it "ad eternum" and forever. Really? A sty in the eye of humanity. I wash my hands! Recommended for those who suffer from insomnia. I hate films. Shit! That's not the point. It's a forgery. The height of madness! A fraud! Worthless! A threat to our policy of good neighbourship. Don't look. This lunatic does not belong to the civilized word. We of the Dept. of Press and Propaganda would like to say that this tattered patchwork was stillborn and it's no use even to try to resuscitate. It is "nati-morta". This film is ugly, boring and upsetting. Only he could have done it. Because films cannot show reality aw and naked as it is. - I go even further... - This time he's gone too far. When they brought the duck-billed platypus to - England, they stuffed it... - It is the height of mayhem. It is a threat to our policy of good neighbourship. All that doesn't fit into our vain philosophy. Popcorn! This is and will be ever more boring! Let the mine cave in! If your foot makes you trip, cut it off! Knock on wood three times. Unbelievable! Enough to try the patience of a saint. Lord deliver us from the demons of this caliber. We'll cut this monster's head off today! Thus have acted the fools of all times! Get this trash out of here. It is not ours. Does it mean something? Go on! When I die, I'll take you to hell with me. Pig swill! The bestial ambition of that gringo! What do you want me to do? Chew and swallow a crocodile? Kick down a wall? Forget it! Amnesium is just an enormous ignorant. Crazy because he has to be. An idiot by heavenly compulsion, his own overgrown shadow. A result of bribery and slaps on the back. Good God! Take care of your holy innocence. The enemy is in sight, a price on his head. Now I know. I will not be accomplice to this unworthy chicanery. I was downcast. I must induce, grope and deduce. Could it be the Blessed? It will be infallible! He's ruining the country's image. When he trod, the earth shook several times. All because of that human hurricane. He couldn't stop creating. He extrapolated, he overflowed. He lost out! He'll end up destroying Brazil's image abroad! He did horrors under the law's very nose. Extrapolated, overflowed. Hide the masterpiece I never made! All down the great drain! Obscene scenes! He'll try to say he was robbed. It's a trick! Give that can! Throw it all into the sea right now! Drift or drown! Export forbidden. The sea is the sea. Ass-shit! The enemy is dead. Now to remove the corpse. Just as well you noticed. I will be the avenger in this case. I'm just an onlooker. As if we lived in different ages and on other planets. ...of a dream that fades. Throw it away. I am a walking movie theater. I know many forbidden films by heart. I saw them overseas. Food for the sharks! All down the drain! The boss is always right. Hunger is no excuse for bad breath. My most Brazilian Brazil, My dark-skinned boy whose wicked smile lingers still, With your laugh you my verses fill, My Brazil were samba plays and with rhythm sways. Brazil, love land made by God's hand. Brazil, Brazil... The Vargases don't forgive. But they forget. In that case, there'll be hell to pay! Hey, wise guys! How's it going? Hi! Thanks, princess... What a lunchbox! Get me out of here! - By the skin of your teeth, boss! - So close! The world's full or it. Never treat a genius like an idiot, to avoid treat an idiot like a genius. Who's never dreamed about Lolita? The cover girl! They are extremely poetic images. I can't stand so much poetry! The most beautiful things are the most hidden. What do you mean to say by that? Cinema is like an ocean, not like a drop of water. Is there any need for so much water? This film isn't worth watching. If this film isn't worth watching... What is this? Have you the slightest idea of who I am? Get lost! Only in his country! Ridiculous! Hey, Boy! Let me go! Absurd! I can't allow such things. Let me go! Show some respect, boy! Moron! - I told you. - What's this? I only won't call the police because... It wasn't quite like that. Ridiculous. The worse it gets, the better. I'll get her, no matter what. Here we dream bigger and better. Do we still have any money? From start, go. This country has the largest reserves of iron-ore and the greatest water reserves. We've made it into a country of sweets! God bless! Sugar, cocoa, banana, tobacco, coffee. A good fork, but an even better sponge. So be it. No one can take away... The eternal character. It won't produce films like it won't produce cherries. See, hear and keep quite! My bibelot! 7 keys, 8 keys, A drink prepared by that madman! A toast to the end of time! - Go for it! - Mad conflicts in hell! It would seem were in for a miracle. Samba in Berlin! Delicious! A Lolita! A rare orchid! Exquisite! Frenetic! There, the bibelot of our Eden oasis! Beautiful! Forget it, Amnesium! She has never lived in society. She can't lie Love, love, love. To and fro, to and fro.. Let's send him to the depths of hell! Perfect for putting him in nice cat's cradle? Go ahead. So far even the devil will get blisters on his cloven hooves, out into the sticks. To make sure he goes completely crazy. Scotch? That madman! Exactly. May he never bother us again! And then... I'll send him to... I want some too... I want some too... A perfect braggart. And then send him to the very depths of hell... and leave him there as light as a kite! That ring is great on her but I must have it back. Marvelous. It's over! May the legal penalties be applied! She's got something going... I'll give the "coup de grace". And the hero is ours... The legal proceedings. A perfect swaggart. To send to the very depths. The good life! Wine and delight! This is the life! Wine and delight! A headful of rum! Everyone made a fool of him! Lolita, is it true you're the whirlwind of Santos? Of course! And you the airborne reporter. You write for the crowds in the sky and clouds. Right? Maybe. But on land, my head is heavy. It's the heat. So let's drive by the casino. OK? I can't. I have business at the Department. As you wish. Persistent rumors. Waves can break the hardest rock. Sometimes even the fame can walk straight. Liquor, rum, lime, Coca-Cola. It's all a 'Berlin Samba'. - On Sinner's Corner? - Where else They also say the gringo wanted to change Brazil. I questioned a friend from the American Embassy and he put his hand to his head and said: "God forbid". Let's show them who's going to outlast everyone. How do you feel? Smashed! - Another? - Of course. I already got it. That guy has crazy legs, as if he'd been bitten by a tarantula. Do you know who I'm talking to? Let's show them who's going to outlast everyone. With the advantages of that gold ring, as pure as the color of its feathers. Cruel destiny. To and fro, to and fro... I never really understood what they wanted of me. We despised him. Pink... Sinners! Morel! A shipwreck, just like a drink prepared by me. Poor thing! And then we send him to the depths of hell, to where even the devil dares not go, because Hollywood has a lovely "apple-pie" bed for him. In the cat's cradle! Certainly enough to make him quite intoxicated enough! Let's drink to the shipwreck like a glass prepared by that lunatic. and then send him to hell, to the very depths where the devil dares not go. He's made his own bed in Hollywood. If the world ends now, be it God's will. Right on! Friends have fled and black magic is hot on his heels. Fame always has its price, Fred. Give the "coup de grace"! I veto it "ad eternum". That shall always be my motto! See if you understand. All together, it doesn't even get close to the "Shadow" series. It's forbidden to think here. Not even close to Zorro. In Brazil, nothing good ever lasts. Whatever it is, spit it out. Saints kick you when you're down. It's not a saint's day. Today's a holiday! Morel! Stunned! It's all a waste of breath. Welles lost a film through the fisherman's mysterious death. Mysterious, the disappearance of the drowning scene. Before he left, Welles paid off Jacar?'s kids. He paid them handsomely. He said he would only tell the whole truth by the time the film was developed. Oh, no! Sounds like a well-planed crime to me. Jacar? talked too much and censorship reigned at that time. - Hard handed. - Really? But let's see what you think. Let's go, guys! I think it was just a crime. And well planned at that. At that time of censorship, Jacar? talked loo much. And it was mysterious. The disappearance of Jacar?'s death scene. All very sinister. The 5 senses are as dumb as a child. They can't tell illusion from reality, truth from fiction. For me, the truth is he is the Napoleon of films, the God of gods! Silly boy! For sure. Give me the ring you slut! I don't have a dime. I need to pawn it. I don't have two pennies to rub together. You have to be sure to start up a scandal. Give me the ring. Don't be so pessimistic. What? A pessimist sees everything on the black side. The optimist only sees pink. Even the colorblind see the blackest poverty there on the screen. Nonsense. Give me the ring. A mere phrase and out of fashion. Since I lost all my money, Aurora has not given me a moment's peace. The ring is all yours. How I hate you! How I hate you! It's not possible. - Aurora - Morel! - How I've missed you! - How I've missed you! - You must see the house! - You're beautiful! Let's go. I'm so tired. Who are they? They're waiting for you. Waste of time, boss. - The Department people. - Now? What I've heard is all a waste of time, boss. If it hadn't been for my watchful intervention... Thinking is forbidden here! - Aurora! - How I've missed you! My love... Are you all right? You're lovely... - The suitcase. - Ah, yes. You forgot the suitcase! It is forbidden to think here. This looks like a swindle to me. Everything makes us look bad. Horrible! - Aurora! - Morel! How was the trip? I found a lovely house in a wonderful town. It was raining heavily. I put on my raincoat. We'll have a roof now, won't we? Something happened on the way back. Really? Aurora, I've looked everywhere... - It can't be, Morel! - I?m sorry, my love. Where's the money for our house? It was the money for the house. Not for me. I know it was the money for the house. I hate you, I hate you! Look, I did all I could. I came running. I don't know what made me put the money in that pocket. Whores? It went on gambling! For heaven's sake, Aurora! You've changed. It's gambling! You're mad! You?ve got mad! I wouldn't even have had time for that This can't be true! It's the money for the house! Our house. You think I did it on purpose? You were never like this... This has to do with girls! - For heaven?s sake, Aurora! - And gambling! You?ve never done this before. It's gambling! For God's sake, Aurora! You've gone crazy! You think I wanted to lose it? Give me that! A dodger can dance his way out! The government does not allow the last judgment. Friends! Let's go boys! Strange! I think one day it will be shown. One day. When they took the stuffed platypus to England, scientists couldn't believe their eyes. They thought the beak was stuck on. Go on with the projection. - Who knows! - Don't be stupid! I think it will be shown one day... These are the wonderful pictures you should film. And always in black and white. Didn't they have films in color then? Of course. Old things are always colored. But the world was black and white. Really? Yes. The world went color around 1940 and color isn't all it's made out to be. How very strange! Yes. Truth is stranger than fiction. Why are old paintings in color, then? If the world was black and white, why didn't they paint it so? Painters always have been crazy, cross-eyed and shortsighted. They were mad irresponsible. Then how could they paint the colors? Weren't their paints only black and white? Of course! Painting went color in the decade of the 40s. Decade? Have a drink! Long live today and forever! That's what counts. Women! The money, the money... I've looked everywhere, in every pocket. It was the money for the house. It was in my hand just now. Enough! Enough! Aurora! Waif and stray! Insolent, arrogant! It's all that damn film's fault! You can forgive planes and typhoons, but not madmen! Aurora, I'm not mad. I may be a bit mixed up, but not mad. As mad as a hatter! - It'll be all... - A stray! - What? - A stray dog! Maybe a stray dog, but with a mistress! It'll be all right, Aurora... - How many? - Trust me. - How many mistresses? - You alone, Aurora. To and fro... Love, love, love... A talented man has talent for everything. Has it ever occurred to you that I am just doing my duty? The party's over. Our duty is to shut that mouth up. The government cannot allow the country to be seen as a beggar. As if that were the totality of our physiognomy. It is the Council's job to judge him, but as I see it, we should grab him by the throat and throw him into a dungeon. As for the so-called film, one day it will be shown. Who knows? One day. At Judgment Day. He wants to compare himself with him. Our drive is to hurt and destroy. The platypus, Mr. Amnesium! Hot stuff! Clearly the best solution is to cater to pride which is perilously near perdition! The mysterious enemy arises: he himself. Let's see what is the best Trojan Horse... You really understand nothing. All this is Brazil. Our poverty, Mr. Amnesium. But also our wealth and greatness. Get out! You Portuguese poverty! That could mean several unpleasant things. All this is clamor from heaven to earth, exhorting me to a more rigorous examination, to cast out the swindler, the swaggart and braggart. are dismissed from this tormented gathering. But you must sign the black book! The brand of power holds the key to chaos. All is canceled for today and forever. I hope... Amen, Amnesium! Amen! Let's show them who's going to last forever with the help of that pure gold ring, as pure as your feathers, little king. Follow me! I give half a century for the material to rest. And I bet no one will even miss it! What shit! It's over. What? Forever. The irony of destiny. A film is like a match. It only lights once. The government is about to fall, to collapse! Follow me! Follow me? Follow me! It has been written! You haven't seen anything yet. Nor will you! "Alea jacta est". The eve's genius is the next day's beast. Amen! I hate everything! And whoever disagrees will be arrested and strangled! Amen, Amnesium. Subtitles: gooz for karagarga, 2018 Translation: GARRY ROBINSON (BRAVO ESTUDIOS)
