It's awful damn quiet. I don't like it. He don't like it either. - Where you suppose everyone is? - I don't know and I don't care. As long they stay there. Freeze. Everybody cooperates nobody gets hurt. What the hell is going on? Look sharp boys. He wants to bear loose, me too. Did you said vamonos? You said what you said? You still want vamos? This is our lucky day boys, the one I waited my whole life for. - Are you nuts? - Yes sir, come this way. I'm not nuts, no. Easy now, don't be too anxious, easy. Easy now, easy, go get it. Go get it, fill them bags. - Fill them up high boys. - Mostly fifty's and hundreds. Don't take anything smaller. Your first job, you going to be able to retire. - Well, I'm suppose to buy that farm. - What you going to do Bucky? Going to Si in a rocking chair and go fishing for the rest of my life, what about you? He pisses all the way on dames, be broke in a week. It's a damn lie, a month maybe, but not a week? - Mine is full. - Mine too. Well, there's plenty more boys, don't be bashful, in your shirt, in your shirt. In your pantys, in your pantys. Under your hat. Step, step, step, this is the propitious moment. A little shy, that's not him. Not a person not a sound. Maybe was son kind of an epidemic. He says maybe is siesta. You tell him this is the United States a we got better things to do with our... time than to lay around in our asses in the middle of the day. - Oh, shit. - What's the matter? Up there. Let's keep going like nothing was wrong. Are you alright? - Ah, yeah. - Oh, what is it? Something wrong? A Nightmare. He said it serve you right, you didn't know that chili. We got a busy day tomorrow, cut your cabbage, - Buck? - Yeah? Think is enough money in that bank to make it worthwhile? Yes. - What is you dreamed about? - Nothing. - Mean you don't remember? - No. - Must've been some pretty awful... - I don't remember. Go to sleep. I've never robbed a bank with a virgin before. A double virgin, his first raid and never been thee. - Give the kid a break, - Don't bother me none. Graham knows a girl who'd be glad to cure you that second one, right Graham? - Why don't you give your ass a chance? - That's enough. He says he sound kind uneasy. Easy, easy... - How did it happen? - Chuckhole. We saw you at the window ma'am. - Beautiful place you have here ma'am. - What is it you want? My associates and I are on our way to an important business meeting in Gladstone City. Unfortunately, this gentleman horse broke one of his leg a few miles back. We need a horse, got any? We pay top money, well. I'm afraid I don't have any horses for sale or otherwise. - What's the barn for? - Horses. The couple that work for me had taken them to town for the day. - Now, what do you suppose that is? - We also keep cows in there, it was a cow. I'll go have a look. Now, if he finds a horse in there, you going to pay a little fine, for lying. A little penalty. - You speak Mexican? - Thankfully no. Well? There's no horse in that barn. - These some kick the stall, we all heard it. - Like she said, it's a cow. There isn't another place between here and Gladstone City where we might get a horse. So we can going in riding double. - Looks like you miss this one Graham. - Damn, I hate to do that. I know, but that's the way it is, you wait here. We'll grab a horse on the way out of town and pick you up on the way back. Can we do it just four? - If I had any doubts I'd call it off. - He don't get no share. I'll divide at four ways, those of you money giving something can. He said he never heard a cow kick a stall like that and neither did I. - You saying I'm a liar? - I said nothing. I'm just going out to that barn and have a peek... on a chance that you might've overlook something. You take one step to that barn is the same as calling me a liar. I can take that bank with four men but I can't do it with three. - We continue this little conversation later. - Whenever you like. It's noon now. Take everything goes right, we shall be back here at 3 o'clock. - I'll be ready. - She heard everything. - I'll keep an eye on it. - I'm sure you will. That horse is the barn is my dearest pet, thank you for lying. No man with an answer regards the woman would've done less. Very nice. The house. Thank you. Reminds me of the many fine mansions before the war, including my own. - I take you were not always an outlaw. - I was Colonel under General Lee. Return to find my home destroyed, business... caught couple of carpetbaggers in the act... shot them. Forced me to my present way of live, forgive me. Oh, there's no need to apologize. Who lives here beside you? Sis Edna and Sam attend the place but they're out for the day, they've gone to town. - Your husband? - He's gone too. - Where and for how long? - He passed away two years ago. - My condolences. - Thank you. I'm sorry to have to do this, but force of habit can tell me search the house... make sure there's no one else here. - Understand, if you like I'll lead the way. - If you'd be so king. The parlor. Oh, I'm sorry. That leads to the kitchen. - What sort of a room is this? - A music room. Though, it hasn't been used since my husband died. Wait, just a minute. - Where is that door go? - The cellar. I keep preserves in that corner and sometimes a jar explodes. - You see? - Yes. Then let me go. - Sir... - What? I'd appreciate if you unhand me. My apologies. For moment there in the dark I was transported to another time and... - someone I held very dear. - I suggest we resume our tour. - How many rooms? - I never counted. - I would prefer do not go in here. - Why not? - Personal reasons. - What kind of room is it? - I give you my word there's no one in there. - What kind of room is it? A bedroom. I don't doubt your word but if I don't see for myself I won't be able to realize. Where is the key? It's a shame to damage such a fine piece of woodwork. All right. After you. Open those. That one too. - Who do this belongs to? - Don't touch it. - Who do they belong to? - Belong to Mr. Starbuck. - Who is he? - My husband. - But you told me he passed away. - He did. Then, why are his things laid out? Mr. Starbuck died on his way from town one evening. His things are line there just as they were that night. They have not and they will never be disturb. How can you sleep in that bed without disturbing? I haven't slept in that bed since the day it happened. And now if you don't mind I'd like to discontinue this conversation. If you don't want to be reminded of it, why do you keep this room like a museum? You are a beautiful woman... locked away here in the bloom of your life. It's crime against nature. What happened to the gentleman, the chivalry? The first law of chivalry is to rescue ladies... in distress and I never met a lady more in distress than you. Your concern is misplace, my life is a happy one and very pleasant to me. Then, why are you crying? I'm sorry, are you alright? - I feel if I faint. - Can I get you something? There is some brandy in the library. Be right back in two chase. Glad to see you're feeling better. Put your hands up. First grade, Mr. Starbuck taught me to use this gun, I learned well. Amen. - Your husband was a lucky man. - Unbuckle your gun belt and drop it. Do as I say. Sit there. Hands on your head. Stop rocking. Yes ma'am. - If you move as much as a hair, I'll shoot. - Yes ma'am. If you think you make me so uncomfortable I'd low my guard... your entry is big disappointment. - Oh boy, I've no such intention. - Then why are you staring at me? You told you shoot me if I move so much as a hair. But doesn't include your eyes. You may look where you wish. Thank you ma'am. - You are still staring at me. - Told me I could look where I wish. Anywhere but at me. Been a long time since I slept in a bed like that. That gray haired gentleman in the picture your father? That gray haired gentleman is Mr. Starbuck, my late husband. Guess my eyes are not what they used to be, I took him to be... in his 60. He was 45 when he died. My eyes are worse than I thought. They provide you spectacles when you get to prison. Do you figure out yet how you're going to get me there? No. My friends will be back at three o'clock and if happens they find us like... this would be embarrassing for me. And very dangerous for you. Well, don't worry, I'll think of something. - You know what I think? - No and I don't dare to. I think you already have a plan. I think you expect company. I think you expect them open the door any moment. And you just play acting with me until they do. Think what you wish. I don't just think it, I know it. You know how I know it? You're blushing. - Your cheeks are turning red. - Be still. - Beef red. - Shut up. Getting redder all the time. - What are you doing? - See you don't have any other weapons. Oh, my God. Enough. If you're so depraved you'd inflict your desires on an unwilling body... then proceed. I will not react, no matter what you do, I won't return. I'm going to close my eyes, won't open them again until you're through. - It's Reverend Cabot. - Not a sound. If I don't go down, he'll come in to see what's wrong. - Does he's a dead man. - He has five children. - Let me go down and send him away please. - And signal he might tray to run off. I'll give you my word. Like you did before, when I went for the brandy? I didn't give you my word then, now I do. Let me go to the door and I'll send him off... without signaling or running away, so help me god. And you come up here on your own free will? Well? Yes. Remember the five children. - Good day Mrs. Starbuck. - Good day reverend. - I was beginning to worry about you. - Was laying down. Fact is I don't feel very well and I... I wonder could we put our meeting to another day? Oh, by all means, would you like that I fetch the doctor? Oh, that isn't necessary. - You do look a bit feverish. - Oh, it's nothing. - You sure? - I'm positive. Oh, I'll be going then, I hope you soon better. - Thank you, I'm sure I will be. - Good bye. Good bye. - Reverend? - Yes? - What is? - I'll see you Sunday. God willing, good bye. Good bye. The reverend is gone. Got your chance to get away, why don't you take it? Because I promised and I always keep my word. Three cheers to you. And now, if you're still your intentions to take me against my will I'll disrobe. In order not to ruin my clothes... and to get this filthy business over as quickly as possible. - No. - You don't want me to disrobe? - Nothing is going to happen to you. - You've a change of heart, praise the lord. I'll let you believe that. Truth not so pretty. - I don't understand. - Just as well. - Is it something you'd like to talk about? - No. Well, sharing troubles often lighten things. Even if I wanted to talk about it, I couldn't put it into words. Try. I can't get it up. Pardon me? I'm incapable of an erection. You know what an erection is? - See, you're shock. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - No, no please, go on please. Since seven years... since the one I loved passed away... I'd been unable to perform a sexual life. About a year ago, I gave up, Resign myself to be an eunuch. - Do you know what an eunuch is? - I believe so. Then we came to this house... and you appeared. When I saw you... I felt something steer in me that I thought that would never steer again. With the look of you, touch you, I was burning with desire, burning. And then that damn reverend knocked on the door and now the moment is gone forever. Don't, don't... - The only way... - Oh, no, no. - Let go. - Don't give up. - Let go. - You mustn't give up. Wait, wait... Are you alright? What is it? The feeling I had before the reverend knocked. - Think is coming back. - There you have, must never loose hope. - It won't last, - Yes, it will. - Ah, no good. - Try. - I can't. - You must please. It's no use. Let me try. You try won't do any good. How was that? It's better, keep going. - What's your name? - Graham Dorsey. Graham Dorsey, that's nice. - And yours? - Amanda. That's nice too. - Graham? - Yes, Amanda? - I think I am in love with you. - Me too. I lied to you before. Mr. Starbuck was 67 when he died. Why you marry an old man? I came from a poor but prominent family in Boston. Mr. Starbuck was looking for a wife. Friends introduced us and voila. Damn. You're sad again? Why? First, because we only have two hours left. Second... maybe the cure you work is only temporarily. - I can't do anything about the time. - And the other matter? Graham? Graham? I see a sailing ship. - Where? - There. You see the castle? - No. - Turrets, drawbridge, everything. Where? You mean that? Looks more like a bank we once robbed in Oklahoma. I bet you robbed a lot of banks. Oh yeah, a lot. - Any famous ones? - Sure. I never heard of the Buck Bower's gang until today. Oh, that's because Old Buck is shroud. You know, the more famous a gang is, the sooner they get caught. So, whenever we pull a job we play it on the James's or the Dalton's/. But they're go down in history and you'll be unremembered. Who cares about history? Anyhow, it's the present that counts and I can think on a sweeter present than now. Nor I. If I should die this very minute, I wouldn't care a bit. Well, if all the same to you, I'd rather live. Which I won't be able to do much longer if I don't get something to eat. Come with me. Wait, just a moment. Are you alright? My hero. - I'm fooling you. - You said you were hungry, come on. - Your husband was quiet a dress. - Help yourself to anything you like. I'm going prepare something to eat. Here in the dining room. Wow, yourself. - Madame... - Sir... To those several hours which have redeem life. I beg your pardon? To those few hours which have redeem life. You were saying? To those few hours which have redeem life. - You mind If I eat again? - No, no please do. - More chicken? - No thank you. - More wine? - Please. - Oh, I forgot the napkins. - Not necessary. We've only one hour left. - Suddenly I feel very sad. - It's time enough for that later. You're right. Come with me, come on. - What you doing? - I'm resuming my life. I'll give you a hand. - Are you ready? - For what? We going to dance. Oh, why must we part? Why can't you quit the gang and stay here? I'm a wanted man. We can live in Boston, Europe, anywhere in the world. - I don't have any money. - I do. Mr. Starbuck left me a fortune. I could never allow a woman to support me. Well, it only be temporary until you went into some business. I know you would succeed, no matter what it was. There is a business I always have a secret desire to be. - What is it? - Bank. I'm serious, before you rob a bank, you've to study it carefully. And over the years I become fascinated with banks. I do have relatives in the highest banking circles in Boston. Wow, we. So, wouldn't you miss the gang? I mean this relative outlaw life. - Maybe, but I'm willing to take a chance. - Oh, so am I. Oh, stop. - No. - Please. - No. - Please. - No. - I'm going to faint. - Fainted? - Oh darling. Oh, my god. - What is it? - I hear something. It's Cody Taylor, he is from the next farm. Seems in a hurry. He's trying to get here. You should've seen it Mrs. Starbuck. I never saw something like it, should've seen it. Cody, simply had to as quietly and simple as you can. They robbed the bank, four men, at least they tried to. But someone started to shoot and it was just a 4 of July. Everybody blasted away and people screaming and running in every each way. Three town people, one the robs, a Mexican kid, shot right between the eyes, right here. And the rest of the gang, what happened to them? Oh, they're captured, they're hang-up 5 o'clock this afternoon. - I've never seen a hanging, do you? - No. And that why I stop, I'm on may way to fetch my folks... I thought you might like to see it too. That was very kind of you Cody. Yeah, triple hanging and you better hurry up or you miss it. I know how you must feel. You don't look very unhappy. Like they say, it's an ill wind, who doesn't benefit, some what. - I fail to see who benefit from this? - We do, you and me. With the gang wipe out, I can stay here. Well, I'm shock you take the fate of your friends so lightly. In the outlaw game you learn to be realistic and not cry over spilt milk. - In this case no milk is spilt yet. - I don't fallow. Well, they won't be hung until five o'clock, there's still time for you to do something. Such as? I don't know, but surely you're not going to let your friends die without raising a hand. Hell, the nigger hits my guts and I never let eye on that kid until three days ago. Oh, what about Buck Bowers? You must've some feeling for him. Oh, I like Buck alright, but not enough to commit suicide. Which I'd be doing if I went anyway in that town. - You saying that for my sake. - No. Yes, you are. Your heart is breaking for Buck Bowers but you deny your feelings out of love for me. You're right. If not wasn't for you I'd try to save them, regardless of the odds. - Go. - What? Forget me and try and save them. You'll never forgive yourself if you don't and you'll end up hating me because of it. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. Now go before I weaken. - I don't have a horse. - Oh, you can use my horse Bell. - Your dearest pet? I wouldn't dream it. - I insist, now go. Be careful. - Good luck. - I'll do my best. Oh my God, your clothes. You forgot to change your clothes. Alright now horse, you and me are going to find a cozy meadow and take a nice long snug. Oh, my God. Take off you clothes. Your clothes, get them off. Not bad, turn around. Good day. Can you direct me the nearest town? You got your nerves showing up in this parts again. Must be some mistake. You damn right and you're the one that made it Doctor Finger... For removing the gold teeth from people mouths... and replacing them with a cheap substitute that didn't last a week... - I sentence you to a year in prison. - I'm not a Doctor Finger. Take him away. I'm not a Doctor Finger. How are you? You sure have us worry. - How long have I been like this? - Three days. Go, open the drapes. What have I missed? All the dead, town's peoples and outlaws have been lay to rest. What about the one in the dress suit? One of gang told the sheriff he was here... and they were heading this way when they ran into. - Don't you have something to attend to? - Why, no. Yes I do, excuse me ma'am. What is it? Well... That man wearing Mr. Starbucks clothes and you in that ball gown. Plus the way you fainted at the sight of his body. I'm not ashamed of anything I've done. Well, that's alright for me, Sam and the Good Lord. But and how you going to convince all this other people? You tell Sam to get the carriage out, I'm going to town. - Good morning Mr. Hall. - What can I do for you? - I'd like some stamps please. - We don't have any. What do you mean you don't have any? What kind of a post office is this? It's a post office of the United States government. Founded on an uncompromising respect for God and the Ten Commandments. You got your nerve. - She's about to shout a tear. - The more you cry, the less you pee dearie. - Which one give you the best ride? - How was the Mexican? It may be as you say. That I deserve to be punished. But if so, let it be for the right reason. The man in the tuxedo was Graham Dorsey. I never saw him before that day and I'll never see him again. But I loved him... deeply and completely as a woman can love a man. And I'm not ashamed to say it. Those few hours make my life worthwhile. I would not undo them them or trade them for anything in this world today. But god is that happens here. Now, do your worst. - What happened? - Never mind that, now start packing. - See anything. - Nothing so far. - Well, keep your eyes open. - I am, I am. Here, let me do that, let me do that. Here they come. Here they come. They're coming, they're coming. We come in peace. I don't care how you come, get off of my property. Haven't you done enough to this poor child? We are here to apologize for our behavior this morning. Don't you come any closer. Like the reverend said, what we done was wrong. We don't approve the consorting with outlaws but we do admire honesty and guts. And you showed more than you show the folks this morning. What you said about loving him... regardless of the consequences... makes me cry when I think of it. This is Mr. Foster, a writer from New York City. I happen to be passing through town and had... the good fortune of hearing what you said this morning. Like everyone else I was moved by it. With your permission and cooperation... I would like to do a book on the entire experience. Share that with the rest of the world. - I'm ordering my copy in advance. - Congratulations. I can't wait to read your book. Where would you like me to start? The very beginning. I heard horses. I looked out the window and I saw five riders coming along the road. How should I know how my life was going to be affected by the one riding double. - Graham Dorsey? - Yes. Describe him. Tall, good looking. - How tall? - Very. - How good looking? - Extremely. - Good morning fellas. - Good morning Mr. Hiram. - What do you got? - You read this? Who hasn't? Do you know the piece about that waltz where Amanda danced? Why, you remember in the book when Amanda talks about the waltz they dance to. - Yes. - Well, we put words to it. - Let's hear it. - Ok. ♪ Some have a lifetime, some just a day. ♪ ♪ Love isn't something you measure that way. ♪ ♪ Nothing is ever, forever, forever is a lie. ♪ ♪ All we have is this feeling, hello and goodbye. ♪ ♪ It's not how long the spring, it's not how wide the sky. ♪ ♪ It's just how sweet the time between hello and goodbye. ♪ ♪ Some have a lifetime, some just a day. ♪ ♪ Love isn't something you measure that way. ♪ ♪ Nothing is ever, forever, forever is a lie. ♪ Ever hear the Union Pacific train robbery... Te Rock Creek bank robbery, the Northfield robbery... or the Diablo stagecoach job? Graham asked. Yes, I said. But I thought the James brothers and the Dalton's did all those things. That's what everybody thinks, Graham said. But it was really us, the Buck Bowers gang. What's so funny? That's a bullshit. Hey... just saw happens, I rode with Buck Bowers and his gang when they pulled some of those jobs. And Graham Dorsey was one of my best friends. Now, what do you got to say? It's good enough for me. Go on. Our hands search each other as we laid there. This is the most perfect moment of my life, I said. - How much longer you got? - 43 more days. What you going to do when you get out? You wouldn't believe it if I told you. - How many sir? - One. That's where happened, the love story of the century. The Starbuck mansion, where we are not allowed to enter the house... Mrs. Starbuck is graciously consented that we might tour the property. Don't be shy. There she is. The wonderful steed that trigger the events on that faithful day. The steed that carried Graham Dorsey on that few of gallant ride to rescue his comrades. A ride which earns him the respect of the world. Ladies and gentlemen... a moment of silence in honor of Graham Dorsey, if you please. There, is where they swam... and spent an idyllic interlude, side by side, staring at the sky. I call your attention for the 2nd floor. Those windows are the master bedroom. By your reaction I can see that you all read the book. So I will not have to describe what happened there. Look folks, you're in luck. It's her. - Oh and that must be Edna and Sam. - Correct. Good afternoon Mr. Taylor, how are you today? - Fine Mrs. Starbuck and you? - Never better. - I trust you folks are enjoying you visit. - Yes, thank you. So nice of you to let us look about. To be experienced what experience and not shared would be sinful. - Would you mind? - Of course. - Thank you. - You welcome. Can I borrow the pencil please? Would mind autographing mine too please? - Thank you. - You welcome. Good day. Wonderful woman. Inspiring. If you enjoy the tour, I hope you'll recommend it to all your friends. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Can I help you? I got separated from the tour, they left without me and wonder if I may trouble you... for a glass of water before starting to walk back to town. Of course, come in. - Sit down, I'll get you water. - Thank you. Your water. - So this is where all took place? - Yes. I've a confession to make. It was no accident the tour left without me, I did it on purpose. So that I could knock on your door and get a peek inside. It's a long walk back to town just for that. Well, for the privilege of... speaking you in person, drinking water from a glass you held in you hand. I'd walk all the way to Canada. I'm touched. You've no idea what your story means to me. Oh, perhaps you'd like to see some more of the house. I don't want to impose but there's one thing I'd like to see. It's exactly the same way you described it in your book. Linen floors, velvet chairs... The harp and a music player. - It's the same song you and he danced? - Yes, it hasn't been touched since that day. - I don't suppose... - What is it? - I shouldn't ask. - Please. I was wondering if I may play it? - Alright. - Sure you don't mind? Well, I never thought I could bear to hear that song again. Now, for some strange reason I find myself wanting to. May I have this dance? May I have this dance? Oh stop, stop please, stop. I think you'd better leave. And I think you had better brace yourself for a shock. I'm shocked enough already. Now, would you kindly remove yourself from this premises. Suppose I told you Graham Dorsey is alive, what would you say? That you're mad, as well as vulgar. Suppose I could prove it? If you don't not leave immediately, I'll ring for the service. I saw them leave. - Hope you have a strong heart? - Why? Now what do you say? Too surprised to speak? It's me, Graham. Pinch, go ahead. If you're through with this tasteless little joke, I'll show to the door. No, it's no joke, I'm him. I mean it's me, Graham. - Yes, of course you are. - I am Graham Dorsey. I'm suppose to hew people like you but perhaps I can help. Come with me, come on, come on. Look. - What do you see? - Graham Dorsey. - How tall are you? - 5' 11. Graham Dorsey was 6 foot 3. How would you describe your appearance? Inferior? Average? Superior? Average. Graham Dorsey was the handsomest man I ever met. Bullshit. Been southerner and a gentleman, Graham Dorsey would never... - use such language. - I'm neither southerner or gentleman. Obviously. I'm Graham Dorsey. Listen, I know how shocked you must be but I am Graham Dorsey. Amanda... hell, I know where you are, you're in the cellar. - I picked the flower in the pond. - That's in the book. - We made love three times. - That's in the book. - The key is kept behind the statue. - In the book. - Your wear lilies perfume. - In the book. - You had tears in your eyes when I left. - In the book. What you doing? I'll show you something that's not in the book. I won't look. It's you. You're him. I don't understand, I saw your corpse. Oh, my God. It can't be. I'll explain it all later, right now, there's a more important thing. - It can't be. - But it is my angel. - Oh no. - No what? - No love making. - Why no? Because if, if we make love, we never be able to say goodbye. We don't have to say goodbye, we're going to Boston, remember? That was before, was just the two of us. Now we have all the others to consider. What others? People throughout the world who'd been affected by our story. - Oh, who gives a damn about them? - I do. And so would you if you read some of these letters I received. From as far away as Japan. Saying how much my story, our story is lifted their hearts. Three cheers for the Japanese, now come over lie down and let's get on with the reunion. - Don't you see? - No. You and I become more than ourselves. Being more than ourselves were obligated... to support into our lesser selves to our greatest selves. You must be talking Japanese, I haven't got the foggiest notion of what you're saying. I'm saying, you and I must part, so that the story of our love... which many people rank with Romeo and Juliet... can serve as an inspiration for generations to come. See this book, Principles of Banking. I've been in prison a year studying it and dreaming of nothing but you. Come up here lie down., And I guarantee in ten minutes you forget about Romeo Juliet and the Japanese. But if people find out I take now with another man, it would... I'm no the other man, I'm Graham Dorsey. We're going to Boston and I'm going to be a banker. - What would that gain us? - A happy life? You'd exchange a lot of fame for a happy life in Boston? Just watch me. Your name is now spoken in the same breath as Jesse James. My name is also spoken as someone who is impotent which is a damn life and I'd... put up for your benefit. You've any idea what is like to be a man known as a guy who can't get it up? And know that reputation is going to fallow him all through eternity? But cheerfully there it's something in exchange. Banking would bore you, the outlaw game is in your blood. The outlaw game is out of source. Rotten rob, filth, rheumatism. Now, you don't stop this nonsense... I'm going to tell that to the world along with a few epitaphs. Like that Buck Bower's gang was only a two bit outfit. That didn't do any of those things I told you they did. And I've no intention of saving them when I ran into that posse. And I'm not the southern gent who lied about a horse in a barn to save you. I had a dream that the bank job wasn't going to work and I wanted to get out of it. - I believe this is called blackmail. - I believe you're right. - You win. - What? You obviously have the upper hand, it would be foolish to resist. You going to Boston with me like we planned? Yes. You've given up too easily. I try myself on facing facts... the fact here is I'd lost and I intend to make the best of it. You're not convinced. Perhaps this will help. Leave this house at once or I pull the trigger. What will these, all, all others think? Japanese? I'd say you were a house-breaker. You wouldn't shoot me, you couldn't. Give me your word, you'll never return, never reveal that Graham Dorsey isn't dead. And I'll see to it that you receive 20 dollars a week for the rest of your life. That hurt me more that anything you could've said or done. Fifty. It's not just banking and you in Boston. I... I love you. 100 dollars a week and that's my final offer. I wouldn't care for it was a 1000. You mean to pull that trigger... or you go to Boston with me. - You're bluffing. - One of us is and I betting it's you. I will let nothing spoil our legend, nothing. No, no. Oh no. All flesh is grass. And all the goodness there are this is the flower in the field. The grass, withered, the flower, faded. But the word of our god shall stand forever. What a brave and happy face she maintain to the world. But how her heart must've ache. Until finally, unable to bear this life without her beloved... she decided to join him... side by side, for all the eternity. Alright, out, everybody. Come on, come on, hurry up. Too lady, you too, come on. - Red, Red Roxy. - And who the hell are you? It's me Graham, Graham Dorsey. - What? - Graham Dorsey, we rode together. This guy thinks he's Graham Dorsey, his a dreamer. In case you missed it, there's a sign on that door, says private. It's me, Graham Dorsey. - Crying out loud, how you've been? - Hi. You don't seem surprised that I'm not dead. Ah, in this business you learn to take everything as charge. - Still like Bourbon? - You just said one of my favorite words. You stay here while I fetch us a bottle to celebrate your return.

I already did. - My dearest Graham. - My darling Amanda. - It's almost three. - How quickly the time is gone.
