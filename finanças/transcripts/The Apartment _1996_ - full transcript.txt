Look at this one. Simple, yet majestic. Sober, but far from common. Its charm resides in its solemnity. This one is more whimsical. More titillating. But don't brush against it. You may hurt yourself. It's made to be caressed only by the eyes. More discreet than the last one and yet full of surprises. It may seem dull, but in another light, it will glow like a star. Look how it sparkles! Amazing, isn't it? Yes... I don't know. I like all three. Can I call you? The Japanese are waiting for you at the "Pergola". Yes, I know. I'm late. Go on, brief me. Okay, then... - Check in at 7 p.m. - Arrival? Tokyo. 2 p.m. tomorrow, local time. After a night at the Meridien, you take Fumiko's jet the next day. That's a cute suit. The taxi's waiting. You come back the 24th. The 24th? That's four days. - 4 days without you. - Call back the jeweler. Farewell, Madeleine. Max? - Lucien! - Is it really you? You cut your hair, handsome! Not in New York? I came back. How long ago? Don't get mad. 2 months. You couldn't call? Don't take it badly. Let me explain. I'm getting married. You're kidding? Her name's Muriel. We met in New York. Cut the crap! I swear it's true. I'm coming! Pain in the ass! I'm double-parked. I better go. I'm off to Japan. I'll call you after. In two years. I may give up the shop, so take my card... as a souvenir. I'm away 4 days. Call you in 5! Excuse me. Mr. Noda, Miss Tami. Max Mayer. It's a pleasure. For me too. Tell Mr. Noda to get his pen ready. Max is our man! Max is a real ace. He's exaggerating. Hello. Meet my sister, Muriel. Mr. Noda. Miss Tami. - No one can do without Mr. Mayer. - Enough, Alain. Here. Take one for the plane. We really should go now. He has a flight to catch. To our project! Mr. Noda is toasting the marriage... of our two companies. Sorry, I have to make a call. Where are you? Weren't we supposed to meet? I have to see you as soon as possible. No, you listen to me. I'm leaving you. That's why I'm calling. For me, when it's over, it's over. There's nothing to explain. I saw it in the papers. I don't think it was an accident. Daniel, I was wrong to call you. Goodbye. Lisa? Are you okay, Miss? Mr. Noda would like to pay. It's on me. He needs the microphone for Monday. That's impossible! I still need the VCR. What do you want me to do? Fredo, figure it out! You've gone too far this time! So? It'll take hours to repair. I'll never finish by Wednesday. When is it for? Wednesday, I think. I'm sorry! - Hi, Michelle. - How are you, Lisa? Demetrius loves you fair. O happy fair! I despise your eyes, more fiery than the stars. I hate your voice, sweeter than the lark's song Sickness is catching. O, were favor so! Then breathing the air you breathe, My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye. And I will snatch Demetrius from you using your very smile. - Max? What are you doing? - Nothing. Hurry, we only have half an hour. What? Think about me. Call me when you get in. I'll call tomorrow. Put me through to room 413. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Room 413 has asked not to be disturbed. - Any message? - This is urgent. - I need to speak to her. - I have my orders. I can't help you any further. Thanks anyway. You're welcome. Excuse me. It's my fault. Room 413. First corridor on the right. - Thanks. - My pleasure. Straighten your leg. You have extraordinary ankles. You should show them off. Can I see them in brown? I'd never wear these. Just a minute. I met someone. - That's great. Who? - An amazing girl. - Yeah? So? - Nothing yet. She's... She's a brunette. Very dark. The strong-willed, tenacious type. A high forehead. Black eyes. Jet black. There's something special about her. There's something sad, something tragic in her eyes. Did you talk to her? That's the problem. She doesn't know I exist. I've followed her for days. I feel like a pervert. This can't go on. That's for sure. Josiane! Where are the Stadlers? Right in front of you. I'm obsessed. I can't sleep. I skipped work yesterday. Lucien, what should I do? Pull yourself together. Then either get her or forget her. Thanks a real lot... Choosing a woman and wanting only her means abandoning all the others. It's stupid. It's cowardly. Lucien... Look around you. Each and every one is special. Look at my salesgirls. That pudgy one. Or the brunette outside. I spend my days at my clients' feet. Why else would I do this job? Show me the shoes in the window. The ones in the corner. Size 37. Max, please see to the young lady. Ask what color. - What's your size? - 37. Do you have them in red? In red? I don't know. Maybe you can go see. Red, red, 37 red, 37 red... - 37 red. - Attack! Go for it! They seem fine. I'll take the same ones in red. In red? Well, uh... I'm sorry. We're out of red. - Too bad. - It sure is. But it doesn't matter because... we'd be happy to... Just leave me... Leave us your phone number and... Do you often spy on people? Excuse me? Don't play dumb. Do you enjoy following me? Do you have lots of time to kill? You're mistaken. Let me... Let me buy you a coffee. Please, just let me... No explanations. No coffee. Give me a call when the shoes come in. Red ones... Goodbye. Tomorrow at 7 at the café on the Rue de Paradis. No need to keep spying. Lisa. It lasted a year. That's the way I am. I fall in and out of love. As if I were double. Or triple. Or whimsical. That's a nice word. There's nothing worse than blandness. Do you have a little maxim for everything? Let's talk about you for a change. I'm waiting... Waiting... I may be offered a job in New York that would... But what I really want to do is to write. A writer. Half a writer. - I've written half a book. - Can I read it? - Once it's finished. - Soon, I hope. I'm not as patient as you. I had a really nice day. So long. What an ass! Tragic Weekend We have a problem with room 413. Daniel de Fouqières, famed art dealer, lost his wife in a car accident Friday near their country house. The funeral is on Tuesday at 4 o'clock at the PSre Lachaise crematorium. I saw it in the papers. I don't think it was an accident. Open this door, you idiots! She's gone! An entire week! Stupid idiots! See if she left something! Hurry up! Excuse me, sir. - I found something by the phone. - What is it? Keys. A woman forgot them yesterday. - What time was it? - Around... 6 o'clock. A shapely brunette. On her way out, she broke her heel. - That's her. - She walked out barefoot. Totally classy. No problem. Give me the keys. If she comes back for them... can you give her this note? No problem, sir. Why are you here? - Do you have a second? - Now? Paola, finish up here. - Your place? - You're not in Tokyo? I never left. I found Lisa! So after two years, you still love her? I just want to try to... Shit. I dropped it. You're never careful. Sorry. We can always replace the mirror. I need to know why she left without an explanation. Why do this to yourself? Aren't you getting married? - What are you after? - Nothing... I don't know. I just have to find her! Yeah, I see. Don't try to understand. Help me. Not my car! Please. If I go to the funeral, I may find Lisa. Anyway, you never listen. - Thanks. - Bring it back by 7. I'm seeing a brunette tonight. You hear me? I fell for a brunette as if she were a blonde. Shocking, huh? Agnès de Fouquières has brutally left us. She is gone forever. Let us remember her face. Her eyes, mouth and forehead will lose their beauty, grace and color. For our body is earth and cannot be reborn. Life fades as rain vanishes into the grass. We are nothing but ash. All that remains is memory. The memory of what was and which will be no longer. Agnès, you will remain in our souls. You are in Heaven, far from life's torments. You see our pain, you hear our cries. Farewell. Receive our tears so that alive and dead, your body is but roses. I'd like to pick up some keys... Lisa? - What'll it be? - A glass of wine. Lisa, I've lost you. I don't know why. I've left your keys in your mailbox. Let me see you one more time. One last time. My love, call me. I love you. Daniel. Shit! You're a real pain. I'm sorry. I really am. Give me my keys. - Now I know where she lives. - You saw her? No, I left her a note to meet me tomorrow. Great. It's settled. Don't brood. I'm sorry. I'm thinking. Can't I? You're an hour and a half late! Thanks to you, I missed seeing Alice. What can I say? Why don't you go now? - She's hardly the kind to wait. - Shit! - Lucien? - It's Alice. - Yes, Alice. - Who are you kidding? - I've been waiting. - Can I explain? I didn't have my car. I lent it to... You lent it out when we have a date? Why? Because... Listen, cut the crap. Sure, have a nice night! Come here! I'm Max, Lucien's friend. It's all my fault. Alice... let me explain. He didn't lend me his car. I stole the keys. Great. "At least" it's an amusing explanation. No, it's stupid. I was totally distraught. Sorry, I didn't mean to... No, it's me. I was looking for someone. A woman. It's perfectly banal. Did you find her? Almost. I'll put Lucien back on. Alice, you're really sweet... Your friend is weird. Yeah, he's a real sap. Are you still coming? At 10, after the rehearsal. See you then, honey. I love you. What goes better, gray or black? The gray one. What are you doing? I had a crazy day. I'm bushed. You're in my bed. Aren't you? Isn't that my bed? Sorry, but it's too small for three. Can't you go to her place? She never invites me. She's a little... Forget about it. It's complicated... for once. - It's not like you. - No, it's not. Shall we go? So you're in love. Turn off the lights when you leave. So you're kicking me out, right? I love thee not. Pursue me not. My heart will not obey. It is a compass pointing in but one direction. Leave your power to draw, I'll have no power to follow you. Do I entice you? Demetrius, wait. I beg of you. I tell you I will never love you. And even for that, I do love you the more. I am your spaniel. Beat me, I will fawn on you. Alice! This is lousy. Can you tell me what's wrong? You're inert. Helena is madly in love at this point! Enough with her goddamned dress! Get lost! What's your problem? You know what love is? You're cold. We open in two days. Wake up. That goes for everyone! It's the pills you gave me for the flight. I slept in my clothes. I just woke up. Max, I feel like you're so close. You're thousands of miles away and you sound nearby. It's true. It's really strange. I miss you, honey. Is it nice out? It's night. What do you mean? Isn't it 7 a.m. in Tokyo? Of course it is. I'm such an idiot. I haven't opened the... shutters. I'm sorry. I'm just... tired. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be hard to get in touch with. Can you tell your brother... Nothing. That things are fine. Okay? Lisa, I found your powder case. Meet me at 10 at the usual place. I'll be waiting for you. Max. Water is like time. It whirls by all the time. Water is like time It whirls and swirls... Water is like time. It whirls by all the time. Lisa! What are you doing here? I needed to talk to you. Are you coming? - I'll meet you there. - Hurry. I tried calling, but it was always busy. I knew you'd be... So I... How are you? So? Let's find a better... You want to have a drink? Whatever you want. I was just offered a job in New York. That's great. Not bad. A big computer company. It's really well-paid. Three months ago, I wouldn't have hesitated. Why? Maybe because I hadn't met you yet. What will you do? It depends on tons of stuff. It's hard to pick up and leave. You have to... You want to share an apartment with me? Hold on... Me and you in the same apartment. Me and you... Sorry, I'm in a rush. Will you pay? Sure... Lisa... Do you want to live with me? I have to rehearse. They're waiting. Wait, Lisa... Tomorrow. Same time, same place. Okay. Goodbye. Two months? You're sure? Yes. They left yesterday. - Around noon. - She didn't tell me. She replaced someone. Do you want a phone number? Come on, stop. I don't want to. Lisa! Lisa, don't! Don't let me go! I have you! I'm falling! Drink this. Leave me alone! Relax, please! You've ruined everything. Yeah, right. - Don't touch me. - I'll put it here. It's a handkerchief for you. - Use it if you want to. - What are you doing here? I'm waiting. I'm a friend of Lisa's. A friend of Lisa's. Is that supposed to be funny? No, I'm serious. My name is Lisa. I live here. I have no friends like you. Stop it. What do you want? Do you live alone here? Don't touch me! I'll scream my lungs out! Seriously, you can trust me. Okay, okay, don't bother. I'll sit right here. In a little corner. I won't move. I'm calm. Now let me explain. I came to find someone. You see the letter there? You wrote it? Did you read it? Did you really find my powder case? Was it you at the café? Wednesday? Yeah, I was there. What is this about? My powder case. Thanks. Wait... What's wrong? Wait. This will do you good. I thought you were someone else. A girl I knew. I was crazy about her. The guy in the Jaguar? I think he killed his wife for me. That wasn't very nice. I should go now. In fact, I will. It's pouring. You'll get soaked. Wait till it's over. I should be in Tokyo with a millionaire. You're responsible for my life now. I can't take care of you. I have to go. Look at yourself. I can't let you leave. You'll jump in front of a car. You'll never sleep there. Don't be stupid. Come next to me. I'll be fine. I've learned to adapt to weird situations. Let's try to sleep. Good morning. You want a coffee? I think you need one. I'm totally out of it too. Come to think of it... I'm going to take a shower. Do you want tea or coffee? I broke all my cups. It's original. One sugar or two? One. To us. You're leaving? I have a very busy day. What do you do? I'm a nurse. I'm going to the hospital. And I have to buy coffee cups. It's hard to picture you in white. It's not too hard a job? You get used to it. You can stay here. I'm on duty until 10 tonight. Anyway, you have the keys. See you tonight? See you tonight. Lisa, it's me. I'm in a booth. Weren't we supposed to meet? I'm sorry. I couldn't get free. I have to see you as soon as possible. Let's meet at my place in an hour. Okay, at your place. Cut it out! Are you crazy? Come back in! Don't do it! Come back in. May I? You really scared me. I'm not scared of heights. And... I wanted to meet you. That's about us. Is it a diary? It's pretty autobiographical. It's nice you came. What do you do besides working here? Lots of things. I read... Books... again! I love reading. I do other stuff too. I enter contests on the radio. Do you win? Sometimes. Last week I won a trip. Great! Where to? I don't know yet. I don't feel like travelling now. Travelling alone is no fun. - What do you mean? - If you had a boyfriend... - What's the difference? - It's important, though. For some women. But we're not all the same. You never fall in love? Let's change the subject. See you tonight. There's a nightly flight to Tokyo at 11. When is it for? Tonight. You mean business! Come pick up your ticket at 6. A friend of yours insists on seeing you. Not now. Tell him I'm not in. I didn't hear that. Just a second. Are you okay? Why are you here? We had a date last night. I was worried. You just disappeared. It's the rehearsals. I'm totally out of it. You couldn't even call? - You couldn't care less. - Stop it. Can't you see... I can't talk! It's our last dress rehearsal. Okay. I'll stop bothering you. Concentrate hard. Alice... You'll be great tonight. Break a leg. You mustn't wear green in a theater. Especially on opening night. That's strange. Why? Green is the color of the devil. Let's continue. I'm a seagull. That's not right. I'm an actress. He's here too. He made fun of my dreams. I too ended up not believing in them. I lost my courage. Then the anguish of love, jealousy, fear... Stop. I lost it. No... give that to me. You were great! Now I'll film you. Go on. - It doesn't work? - No sound. I don't believe it. Let me see. - Can you fix it? - Not on your life. Me neither. It doesn't matter. I know where we can get it repaired. Are you a little in love? Not at all. I was just asking... - Would you tell me? - Of course. I have an errand to run. - Want me to come? - No, I'll just pick up the camera. See you tonight. I'm sorry! Hi. I'm supposed to meet Max at our usual place. But I have to go to Italy. - What for? - A two-month tour. It's in my letter. I told him to wait for me. I have no stamps. Mail it for me. I'm off. My train is in fifteen minutes. He asked me to live with him. I'll keep you posted. Will you live with him? Yes, if he can wait two months. Why Rome? I have a friend who's lending me his house there. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow. Are you sure you don't want to come? I can't leave the hospital. I have responsibilities. You'll spend your life in a hospital? It's important to care for others. Definitely. Especially when they send you roses. - How is he? - Not bad. We made love last night in the lounge. The problem is, I'm already dating a colleague of his. He works day shifts. A dermatologist. He's adorable and he adores me. The clinging type. Let's sum this up. Same name, same shoe size, different woman. What does she look like? How could I have mixed them up? Did you... Did you... No, we were... I couldn't leave her alone. So I took the chair... And she fell into a deep sleep. Deep... deep? Seriously. And when I woke up, she'd already left. It was as if I'd dreamt it. Any regrets? - Meaning? - Nothing. Just a vague impression. Hold on just a second... Max. I know you. I'm going to Tokyo tonight. All I care about is Muriel. I'm sure of it now. Whatever you say. How was the other night with Alice? You never told me. It was fine. - Fine? - Yeah, fine. You want a drawing? Hey, sorry for showing interest in your life. We went out to eat. I told her about your screwy story. She laughed. Then we came back here. Let's go eat. What happened with your friend? He ended up finding Lisa. What? They saw each other? No, but he knows where she lives. He found her address. So are they going to meet? Yeah, he set up a date by letter. Indian or Japanese? Indian or Japanese? I don't feel well. I feel sick. I'd like you to take me home. - You don't want to... - Do you love me? Let me spend the night at your place. You know you can't! Sorry, I'm really tired tonight. Maybe tomorrow. What does "maybe" mean? Don't scream. I'll call you tomorrow. I won't be available tomorrow. I'm sick of this hot-and-cold treatment. Please, tomorrow. We made love all night long. At dawn she fell asleep in my arms. It was amazingly tender. Amazingly tender. When will you introduce me to her? Her play opens tonight. Why don't you come? You know who I dreamt of last night? Max. Max Mayer. Remember? Two years ago, before Daniel. Don't you remember? Vaguely. I was walking by him in the street. I wonder if he's forgotten me. Do you think dreams can come true? I think he must be married with two or three kids. He just left. Without saying goodbye. For once, I wanted to settle down. You see? You should never go against your nature. Try not to think of him. I don't want anything anymore. Travel. Travel... Where to? Here. What's this? It's a trip I won. You're not going? Am I? Dear Alice, We should never doubt our fate. Thanks to you, I've met the man of my dreams. His name is Daniel. He's rich. He's handsome. And he's married. I love you. Lisa. What's wrong? Nothing. I need your car again tonight. Do you mind? Night shift? If it's for an emergency... But steer clear of my neighborhood. Daniel knows my car. I wouldn't want him popping up here. Aren't you exaggerating a bit? Do you think I'm crazy? That I imagined everything? I never said that. But you have no proof. I know Daniel. He's capable of anything. Still... You never let him explain... You really don't love him anymore? Maybe he's just a man who lost his wife and wants to start over with you. - You know I couldn't hurt you. - I know, Daniel. Why hide behind a phone? You saw my letter. I'm not asking much. Your letter? What letter? I haven't been home. I'm not as dumb as you think! - It's the truth. I swear. - You want the truth? You're in love with someone else! What are you saying? I saw him at your window. You hear me? I saw him, Lisa! Daniel, you're out of your mind! Tell me where you are. Wait, Miss. I have a letter for you. You forgot your keys. A young man left this for you. Here. This is for you. Can I change the date of a flight to Rome? For date changes, you have to stop by the agency. - We close at 7. - I'll be right there. Thanks. Lucien, come here. What is it? I have to pick up my ticket. I'm late. - You're leaving now? - Yeah. You're coming tonight... I can't. I'm really sorry. Honestly, I can't make it. I'll call you, okay? Wait! Max! You have to come. I'd like it. It'll help me. I have stage fright. - For her? - For myself. Things aren't working out for us. I don't know why. She's acting strange. - I can't handle it... - So you're scared. Now you understand. - Okay, see you later then. - At 7:30. Roissy 2. Terminal B. Right? Yes, one hour before take-off. This ticket can only be changed 2 days in advance. Are you sure? Do you have a light? Leave me! Woe betide you! Shouting, running, running, shouting! No one hears my pleas. Whereas Hermia, to be happy, need only breathe. Who is here? Lysander? - Sorry, I'm late. - Look. That's Alice. If you are alive, awake! Run through fire I will for you. Transparent Helena. Luminous Helena. Demetrius! How fit a word! Is that vile name to perish at my sword! Do not say! - Go on! - Hermia loves you Me, content with Hermia? I repent the tedious minutes I with her have spent. Not Hermia, but Helena I love, you. What's wrong? Keep quiet. And you keep sleeping! The curtain! Lysander, do thy best! To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast? Keep your cool. Should I come? No, I better go alone. Go take your plane. Don't cry, Alice. You were great. Thanks a lot. You've humiliated us, discredited your fellow actors and put my career in jeopardy. I don't know what happened. You're out. Brigitte will take your role. You belong in the circus, not in the theater. Alice? It's me, Lucien. Can I come in? Leave me alone, Lucien. I want to be alone. Don't be silly. Let me in. You're not alone. I don't want your friend to see me like this. Open up. I'm alone. He left. He found me that bad? I chased everyone away, right? What are you saying? He went to Tokyo for business. Tokyo? But I thought... - Are you okay? - Yes. No. I was awful. I don't know what got into me. Get dressed. I'll take you out to eat. I'm not hungry. Yes, you are. Help me. I don't know what to do. How do you prefer me? With or without? Or half and half? - Did he find the woman he loves? - Who? You. Your friend who left for Japan. He met a madwoman with the same name. I'm a madwoman too! You don't get it! I've never loved anyone so much. I wanted you to come here so badly. No more fooling around. I want only you. I want to live with you. I love you. Alice? It's Lisa. Lisa? Where are you? In Paris. - In your letter, you said... - I'll explain later. Can I see you today? - I don't know if... - In 2 hours at the Pergola. - If it's an emergency, I'll manage. - It is. - Give your friend a kiss for me. - You don't know her! Why can't I meet her? See you tonight. Tell Mr. Noda to get his pen ready. Max is our man. Max is a real ace. Lucien, if you're there, pick up the phone. - Max? You didn't leave? - No, I came back here. I slept in the apartment. I don't get it. What's going on? I waited all night. She never came. Who? - The girl from the apartment. - Unbelievable! I didn't tell you everything. We did make love. It thought it was a one-night stand, but... I don't know what to do. - Tell me. - Calm down. Then meet me here. - Can I speak with Max please? - Who's calling? It's Lisa. I'm a friend of Max's. It's about my powder case. Lisa? Which one? I'm sorry about last night. I had a problem at the hospital. I couldn't free myself. Are you angry? No, I had a great night. Except for breakfast this morning. - Where are you? - Where? In a café near the hospital. I'm leaving now. Will you wait for me? He should be here any minute. Can I have your number? - Do you have a pen? - Go ahead. No, I'll meet him at the usual place between 4 and 5 o'clock. At the square. Did you get that? I'll be sure to tell him. He'll be surprised. Wait, this may be him. No, it's not. I'm sorry. Okay. Goodbye. I went out for cigarettes. - What is it? - It's incredible! I just spoke to Max. I thought he was in Tokyo, but he's here. He slept in that girls apartment. What an idiot. Really? And there's more. Just after, the real Lisa called me. His ex-girlfriend. The one he really knows. The other one pretended she was Lisa. How crazy! - Did you tell him? - What? That he fell for a crackpot? It's sort of delicate. Where are you going? I'll call you later. I promise. Where are you going? I can't stay. Wait. Do you like me? You're crazy! Are you free tonight? We can meet here. Okay. Only if you don't stand me up again. You're stupid. - What's that? - A present. For me? Sit down. I'll help you put them on. You should have asked. I'm a 39. It doesn't matter. It was really sweet of you. Alice! Something incredible happened! Let me tell you! I need to talk too. I'm a total wreck. I keep doing terrible things. I can't stop. - I've never stopped lying. - Wait. What's going on? It's too complicated. I need to be alone. To stop it all. Listen, I'm not leaving. I'll explain later. Use my ticket. Why don't you go to Rome for a while? Lisa, I need to tell you... I've never set foot in a hospital. What are you saying? Why are you here? Why aren't you at my place? What is it? - I saw the girl from the apartment. - Shit. Come on. I'll introduce you to Alice. Come on. I'm glad you called. Did I take too long? Max, meet Alice. Alice, Max. It's as if you know each other. What will you have? A double vodka. Richard, two vodkas, please. Tell us what happened. Alice knows everything from A to Z. Nothing. I had my doubts. That's why I went. You know how curious I am. Yeah, you're a curious kind of guy. It's like when you find a girl pretty from behind. Never double-check. 9 times out of 10. Did you see her again? Just to confirm that she's a liar. A mythomaniac. You got worked up for nothing. - For very little. - Glad to hear it. Did you leave a message at the bar here? How do you know? Lisa told me. Your Lisa. Meet her at the usual place at 4. Shit. At least you were right about her powder case. I almost believed her... She seemed so distraught. Never trust people who are too sincere. What do you think, Alice? You seem trustworthy. It's easy to judge. But what do you know about her? She lies well, without misgivings. And so she's insincere? You're the same, but hypocritical too. Could you explain that? Hey you two, calm down. No, go on. I'm interested. Maybe she's loved you for a long time. Maybe she's been trying to find you. Wow! A real Harlequin romance!
