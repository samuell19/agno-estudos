Hi, Trevor Night. I'm here to see my wife, Cindy Night. Excuse me, Doctor, can we do that later? I just wanna see my wife. What, what do you mean you've lost? No, I just saw her this morning. You stop talking, just take me to her! Is he coming? Just take me to her. Just take me to my wife! Where is she? You did this! You killed her! You killed my wife! You killed her. What'd she name him? Hey Man. Oh. Is everything okay? I think you saw him coming. Sit. Sit. Jackson was attacked tonight. Oh my god. By who, is he all right? Yeah he's still home asleep. Did you call the cops? No. Why not, he could need medical attention. I can't tell the cops. I can't take him to the hospital. They might suspect me. How? I took Jackson with me in the investigation with Wolsey Estate. Off Lincoln, you know, the double homicide. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I lost him. This way. Dad? Do you want to play? There's nothing here, let's go. Jackson? Jackson? My dad's gonna be mad at me. What do you mean? Jackson, where are you? He's coming. How'd you lose him? I don't know. One minute he was there, the next minute he was gone. Couple minutes later I hear him screaming. Billy! Billy! Jackson? Dad! Billy, I know you're in there! Open this door! I know you're in there! Jackson! Dad! Dad! Open this door! You broke it! Jackson! So it was a gunshot comes home, knocks me back. As I'm getting up the door is open and Jackson's unconscious on his back with markings on his neck. Well is he okay? Yes, dammit, he's fine. David did you not hear a single word I said? Yeah, sounds like you said that Jackson can see spirits. Yes. But more than that. I believe Jackson relives what happens to the spirits. I don't know, Man. We've been doing this for what, seven years and nothing like this has ever happened. Read the case file. Mr. Stone, father of Billy Stone strangled himself to death in a closet and shot himself three weeks later after the loss of Mrs. Stone who died battling cancer? Reason behind the killing points to high depression of Mr. Stone. I'm telling you, Jackson saw that. Dad. You broke it! Jackson! Dad, help! Told you not to do it! Why, why, why?! Ah, help, Dad! No, Mommy! It's me! It's me, it's just a bad dream, okay? You're just having a bad dream. Okay? Good. Jackson, why did you say Mommy? Trevor, I think it's too.. Did you have a dream about Mommy? Hmm? Have you ever seen Mommy? Answer me, Jackson, have you seen her? Have you ever seen.. Trevor, that's enough, Trevor. I'm sorry, Jackson. I'm sorry. It's okay. This is Trevor Night at the investigation of the Wolsey Estate where less than 24 hours ago Jackson was attacked by, I believe a paranormal entity. Is there anyone here who would like to communicate with me? Anyone at all? Jackson said there was as child named Billy. Billy, would you like to communicate with me? Or maybe your father would like to say something. The man who killed you! Or do you only pick on children, huh? Come on! Come on! I'm not goin' anywhere! Trevor? Oh Jesus, David. Hey, what's going on? What happened in here? Yeah, nothing happened. What do you need? 6:30. Your son. Great! Can you get the equipment? Yeah, I'll go, I'll get it, I'll get it, go. Trevor, everything okay? I'm late. Betty. I'm so, so sorry. Trevor, you're four hours late. That's the fifth time this month. I know, I'm sorry. I just got carried away at work. Well you always do, Trevor but I need you to know that this is the last time because I'm done. What? I can't watch Jackson for you anymore. I have my own kids to think about. Oh, come on Betty, look. I am sorry, I'm doing the best I can. I know you are, Trevor and I feel for you and Jackson, I really do. But this is putting such a strain on my marriage and on my own home life. I can't do this for you anymore. You're just too unreliable. And then something else happened today, Trevor. Something that makes me think that there could be something wrong with Jackson. What do you mean wrong? Well, Trevor, I found these drawings under his bed. Just hateful drawings, drawings of people's deaths. But then this one, this one was different, Trevor. This one he put above his head. Do you think that that could actually be a picture of Cindy? Not sure. Has he ever done anything like this before? No. Okay Trevor, look, I know we've been neighbors for over 10 years but I really need you to know that I just can't do this anymore, okay? I can't watch Jackson for you. I understand. I do. I do. Okay. Thank you, Betty. For everything you've done. Of course Trevor, of course. Thank you. All right, well you have a good night, okay? Okay. Jackson, you still awake? We were supposed to play baseball today, weren't we? Boy, I blew it. I'm sorry. So... Tomorrow, I promise. How about it? Hmm, nothing, huh? Not even if I take you with me to the market before we go play ball, pick up a new baseball? Okay, that's a little improvement. But not enough. So what if we go and pick out a baseball and a new bat? Thanks, Dad. Thank you, Buddy. Good job. No, you can carry it. It's your new ball. Is it easy to throw a new one than that old one you had? Yup. Yeah. Always was for me too. Jackson? Do you see something? Jackson, do you see something? Okay. It's not gonna be like it was. All right, they can't touch you. Now I need you to be brave for me. Can you do that? I need you to tell me what you see. Can you tell me? I see men. Okay, good, good. Can you show me? Where are they? All right. How many are there? About 15. What are they doing? Carrying boxes. What, what's wrong? They heard me. Jackson, what's going on? What's happening? Dad, please. Why are you stopping? Who's responsible for this? You! Who are you? Who are you working with? Who are you working for? Answer me! Nothing's gonna hurt you! Jackson! Jackson, are you okay? Are you okay? You're dead! No! He ratted us out. Jackson, are you hurt? Are you hurt? Jackson. I believe you. You hear me? I believe you. Okay, there you are. There you are. I do believe you. Jackson, listen to me. You can't tell anyone about seeing these things. But why? Well. People are scared of what they don't understand. But not me. It's my job to study and try to find these ghosts and help them. Like how you try to find Mommy? Drink your water. Yeah, like Mom. Dad? Yes, Jackson? What happened to Mommy? I wish you slowed down. Uh huh. No, no you see he's never done any problems like that before. Well. If you think he needs a week then a week it is. Buh bye. Let me explain. I thought we were clear on this. No drawings in public. No speaking about ghosts in public. How do you mess that up? Yes.. And now, she is taking you to the psychiatrist. For a week, everyday, she will be dropping you off. What? Oh, she insisted. And if I put up any kind of argument it would have looked suspicious. You fix this. You say whatever you have to say to make this go away, do you understand? Jackson, do you understand? Yes, Sir. Now, go finish last weekend's investigation. And I want cleaner drawings, better than what you've done the last couple of times. Go! Wait, wait, wait. She said there were some papers for me or something. Jackson. Oh hi, Jackson, Mrs. Lewis. Just go ahead and have a seat over there, Jackson. I am just finishing up here. Shouldn't we wait? Wait? Wait for what, Jackson? You've been feeling okay, Jackson? Any more drawings since our last visit? No Sir, I'm done with that. Did you just see something now? We should probably wait until she comes back. Ah, yes, thank you Jackson, good catch. I'll be right back. Sorry about that. So Jackson, how have you been? Good, I've been good, thank you. These drawings, any inspirations? Inspirations? Ghosts? Like I said before, the kids dared me to draw them. I didn't mean to offend anyone. I see. Did you know Jackson, that one of your pictures shows a murder that took place 20 years ago? No Sir, I just drew what the kids told me to draw. I wonder how they knew what to tell you to draw. Maybe you should ask them. Jackson! That's okay. Oh, that's my daughter's rocking horse. Would you like to take a look at it? I really don't wanna talk about ghosts or about drawings anymore today. What I would like to talk about, Jackson is your father. How is your father, Jackson? My father, he's doing good. Why? Well you know, it seems like he's a celebrity now. I've seen him on TV before talking about ghosts and writing books about the supernatural. Does it bother you that he's not at home with you? It's his job. I know it's his job. But what I'm asking you though, Jackson is does it bother you that he's not at home? He keeps hurting me. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. You haven't done anything wrong. I know these questions are tough but you know I have to ask them in order to help you. Please, stop. Jackson. Jackson, do you understand? Yes. He won't stop hurting me! Who? Who? Are you even paying attention to me, Jackson? I'm talking about your father, of course. Jackson? Jackson, do you understand? Jackson? Jackson, are you all right? Jackson. Jackson. Does what your father.. I love my dad, all right? Jackson, Jackson! Miss Lewis? Yes, Jackson? Did something happen to Dr. Hinson's daughter? What makes you think something happened to her? He sounded sad when he mentioned her horse. Unfortunately, something bad did happen to her. She slipped and fell, hit her head, passed away. He loved her a lot. Did he? Yes. What are you looking at? Nothing. Thank you. He'll be home soon. Good night, Mrs. Lewis. Hey you. Don't you turn away from me. Don't you turn away from me. Look at me, look at me! Now! Boy! Don't you run away from me, Boy! Why don't you look at me? Look at me! Open your eyes, dammit. Open your eyes, open your eyes! Jackson, get up! Come on, let's go! Case Study 47, house of the Hill Residence where three months ago a family was brutally murdered ending in an execution style shooting. The police have not been cooperating in providing names of suspects. And Ted Hill, brother of the deceased father Jeremy Hill has asked that we step in and try to come up with any answers. David, you good? Yup, everything's good. Jackson, you good? Jackson? I don't think we should be here. What do you mean? You know what I mean. Give us a moment. This is very important to my research, you understand? These people are looking to us to give them answers. The press, to deliver a story. And if I can't give them a story then I don't get paid. If I don't get paid, then you can't go to college. It's a classic help me help you scenario. I'm telling you, I don't feel right about this place. Which is why we have to be here. Look, every one of those other potential GH5 scenarios that we left because you didn't feel good about them, well the press got bored. They want a real ghost, real answers. And if I can't give that to them, then I'm gone. Along with your hope for college. Jackson. You have to do this for both of our futures. I'll be right in there. Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Okay, good. Everything good? Everything's fine. What are you doing? Are you scared of that? Are you scared of that? Yeah? Yeah. Let me tell you something. Not nearly enough. You know, always had big fun games. I liked it. We, as in my family, liked it. So tell me. Do you like games, huh? Do you like games? Yeah, yeah! Good. 'Cause we're about to play one right now. Why is he sitting like that? It must be what the ghost wants. Pay attention. Did you or did you not attend a party at the Hill's Residence last Friday night? I don't.. Nah, nah, nah. A simple yes or no will do. Yes. Good. You see everyone how this works? Now Bobby, next question. Do you like sex? What are you some kind of.. No! No, Bobby! A simple yes or no will do! Yes, yes! Now Bobby. Shut up! I'll get you in a minute. Now Bobby, next question. On that same night, did you have sexual intercourse? Yes, yes I did. Yes, that's a yes? Yes! Your son's sick. Leave my son alone! Oh, what's that? The lawyer would like to have a word huh? This is crazy, my son's innocent! Did you or did you not pay off the judge to save your son? Answer! Answer! Answer me! Please! Nothing, huh? Tell you what. I'ma get Mom in the mix, shall we? Please, no! Shut up, you had your chance! Ah yes, Mom. Oh this all looks fun to me, Mom. Hey, Mom. Trust me, my wife and daughter did a lot of crying too. But I have to ask you a question. My wife says you just chaperoned this party. And that you ensured everyone's safety. But I wanna ask you this. Did your confidence go? Oh, hold that just one second. Hey, hey, stay with me. Hey. Yeah I know, stay with me. Just one last question for you. All right? Did you rape my daughter, Crystal Winters? Yes! Yes? Yes! So Mom, you think your son's a rapist now? No, he could never.. No! No! Barry, you son of.. Have a look see for yourself, Bobby. See that Bobby? So I got one last question for you. You think you're a religious man now? Huh? You know, the funniest part about all of this is Crystal wasn't even a good lay. Let me tell you something. You think that's gonna save you where you're going? No, no, Son. You gotta beg the Devil to keep me from you. And when you get down there and when I find you, and I will find you, I'm gonna take your soul and rip it, rip it apart. You deserve it. What was that? Trevor! It's fine. Breathe, Baby. I love you. You're free now. So please forgive me. Please forgive me. Dad, get me out. No, no way! Dad! That's impossible! Dad, get me out! That is impossible! Dad, where are you? You have to die! Dad? Get me out, Dad! David, we got this. I killed you! Dad? Dad? Dad, Dad! Trevor! You have to die! Dad! It's okay, it's okay. What happened? Where were you? Where were you? Jackson, I tried! I needed you, where were you? I tried, I tried! No you didn't try! You just baited me. You just made me sit here! I was here! No, you just had me sit here and wait for your investigations! That is not true! It is true! You know what, I'm done. I'm done! What? I'm done! You're done when I tell you you're done! You owe me that! I owe you? We're not gonna find Mom! She's gone, she's moved on. Why can't you? Don't you talk about her as if you knew her. You didn't! Mom chose me out of love. She sacrificed herself so I can be here. Why can't you understand that? She chose wrong. Wrong? You took her from me. You took her from me! She's dead because of you! You took her from me! Don't you understand that? Do you? You took her! You wish I died that day instead of her. I think we both know the answer to that. As ready as you can be, right? Oh yeah. Crystal. Is it true? Is what true? Is your father Trevor Night? Let me explain, let me explain. Please, please, let me explain. Crystal! Oh. You knew. You knew and you said nothing! Please don't do this. No. I only wanted to help. Help? Only one man helped me, Jackson. And he's dead now, dead! I didn't know about the book. But you knew about me, about my father about what he sacrificed to save me and you said nothing? You saw it? Answer me. Yes. Your father just killed my dad's sacrifice. Do you understand that, Jackson? Do you? You left me alone! Hey Man. How you holding up? Look, sorry about Jackson, Trevor. Just, I don't even know if you wanna know about this but cops are saying that they're hearing things at the house, seeing things. Fireplace starting up, hearing voices and stuff but, I saw a guy with a teal vest. It's what Jackson was wearing that night, Trevor. Stop it David, stop, what are you doing? I'm trying to help you. David, look. My son is dead. So why are you bringing all this stuff in? I'm trying to help you! Bullshit. You want what I have! Fame, fortune, so easy! No, no! That's never what I wanted! That's what you wanted! Money, fame! But not me! So I didn't care about anyone else! I just wanted more fame! All you care about is yourself! More money! Yes! I don't care about my son? No, you never did! I cared about him. I loved him, and I loved you. You know what? Don't you ever say that to me! Don't you ever! It's true, it's true! This is my son! Get out! Let me grieve in peace! Night residence. This is he. Did he say anything? No Sir, he didn't really say much. All he asked for is some paper, that's all he asked for. Can you explain to me what this is? My god. Can I have just a moment with him? Yes Sir, you may. But you gotta leave the door open so leave the door open. Okay, all right, thank you. You're welcome.
