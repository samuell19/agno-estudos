The authorities have promised changes. The pressure for reform is supported. The difference between capitalism and communism is so great - - that only concrete and barbed wire... We want to shape society in a different way. On the streets of East Germany - - people are demanding democratic reforms... Security police dragged people out of the crowd - - hit them in the head and threw them into the trucks. I was born in 1971. I was 18 in 1989 when the Berlin Wall broke. I listened to the radio when communism collapsed. During my studies, I traveled to Romania, Hungary and Russia. I saw the consequences of the collapse. I saw a failed economic and social system. The political system that promised exemption - - but brought mere misery and political recession. When the communist card house collapsed - - the capitalist argument was strengthened. But it went too far. Belief in an unregulated market was endless. In addition, private ownership began to be glorified. As a result, inequality was on the rise - - as well as nationalism and xenophobia - - as before the First World War. The 21st century scares me, because history suggests it - - that we run the risk of returning to the capitalist system - - which is like the unequal world of the 19th and 20th centuries. CAPITAL IN THE 21ST CENTURY Capital: The financial or equivalent assets of a person or organization In 18th century Europe - - capital was concentrated on a small number. The aristocracy represented one percent of the population. Money limited social mobility. Hard work and training did not help in climbing up. Often in literature, films and popular culture - - can track the importance of capital throughout history. It's a much gloomier story - - like an idyllic march towards development and light. In the 18th century, the lives of the poor were miserable. If there was luck, maybe there was a servant. All the others were hand-to-mouth workers, travelers - - which the landowners treated as they saw fit. Of course, there were no benefits, no health care, no education, and nothing else. Poverty was the death penalty. The average life expectancy in the 18th century was 17 years. The capital at that time was money, loans and land ownership. The man sitting in the fort collected taxes from his own farm workers. We know from different movies what it looked like. I can hardly afford the perfume. Has Roulet paid its rent? - Roulet died last week. - Without paying rent. - Where did he die? - I'm starving. Hunger is a pleasure for the peasants. Gabelle, you are a humanitarian. You value people equally. It's very naive. Inheritance was an obsession for the rich. The eldest son inherited the capital. He got everything: money, a house, lands. It only made him very influential at birth. These first boys also had great political power. Many of them were MPs, elites. As a result, they wanted to protect their income and their world. It never occurred to them that the poor deserved - - redistribution of wealth. They strongly opposed taxation. This is how the aristocracy worked not only in Britain, but throughout Europe. The aim was to preserve the power of the aristocrats. Thomas Piketty’s examples of Austen and Balzac are illustrative. Jane Austen’s books revolve around money. No money earned by work - - but it has been inherited as land. Mr Darcy has huge lands of pride and prejudice . He doesn't even have to be there. The country brings him money. Thank you for coming. - She looks unhappy. - But he's not really poor. He earns 10,000 a year and owns half of Derbyshire. The unfortunate half? Austen created a fantasy in which wit gained some wealth. But in reality, Darcy would never have taken Lizzie Bennett - - who didn't have a penny of money. She marries an heiress, possibly even a cousin - - to create even greater wealth. Money fucked money. Love had nothing to do with it. Now we can see almost a return to the 18th century. Wealth inherited in Britain is all in all again. Today, one percent of the population owns 70 percent of the country. We have always had an elite that recreates its privilege - - and monopolize economic, social and cultural capital. The elite will remain in power and pass on privileges to the next generation - - also by modifying our way of thinking. Economists say poverty is an excellent motivator - - development and inventions. It is thought that competition makes people try harder. The problem is that extreme inequality - - increases economic, social and political stress. If the elite defends their ranks so firmly - - that no one else can rise, the result will be a complete revolution. Life in the 18th century was not static. New policies call for the same rights for all - - and the cessation of inherited benefits. The motto of the French Revolution was freedom, fraternity and equality. There was a brotherhood in store. Everyone had to be free. But in a short time the bankers government - - began to create the elite again. Before we fought for freedom Today we fight for bread Equality has the weird side that death brings to everyone Take your seat, take the risk Vive la France, Vive la France The French Revolution was based in part on hypocrisy. The vision of equality was optimistic and a little naive at best - - and at worst a little cynical. We believed that equality would happen - - spontaneously and spontaneously, a bit like in a fairy tale. In reality, it requires political institutions - - education, healthcare, public transport - - and high-income taxation. But these were not there at the time of the French Revolution. In the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries - - manual work changed to machine. The machines began to make wool, cotton and various commodities. They make products faster and unify them. It increases returns. Capital is no longer something fixed, land - - or even the ability to lend money to others. People finally realized they could expand their factory - - by selling goods, holding income - - and placing them in the expansion of the factory. That is what modern capitalism allows us to do. Capital becomes something that can be constantly expanded. But the gap between wages and productivity was large - - and feudal labor traditions were in the figures for a long time. In Britain, it was illegal to resign from a job without permission. It was actively used in the mid-19th century - - at the height of capitalism in England, the most advanced country in the world - - where workers were imprisoned and beaten - - because the strike was illegal. The idea arose to escape the old world - - and to establish a new, more equal society. When the new world of New Zealand, Australia and Canada was established - - the founders were refugees fleeing Europe - - at a time when capitalism was really gaining a foothold. Therefore, many of these people wanted to get out of the country. They wanted a more equal society. There was a desire to leave the class society - - but it was done freely. It was not a political movement. The wealthy began to rule right from the start. For the white man in the 19th century - - Australia and USA were the best places to go. There was enough land. The only problem was labor mobilization. A small family farmer could only mobilize his own children. But the owner of the slaves could go to New Orleans, take out a loan - - to buy slaves from the New Orleans slave market - - and take them to Alabama and begin to clear the land and grow cotton. The profits made it possible to buy more slaves and more land. The slave economy was thus also part of the cycle of wealth accumulation. But the slave owners did not just have labor. They also had access to capital - - because slaves act as guarantees. If you are considering giving a loan to someone - - and he may give guarantees as slaves or land - - slaves were better because they were easier to move and sell. The 19th century was the time - - in which division of labor, inequality and power relations were defined. First with the help of slaves and then with violent colonialism. It is difficult to say what part of the current wealth of European countries - - dates from the colonial period - - but the advantage achieved by the Industrial Revolution - - was clearly connected to the warlord. Between 1870 and 1914 - - Great Britain and France, two large colonial powers - - owned so much of the rest of the world - - and therefore received so much profit, interest, dividends and rents - - that they could afford to continue investing in other countries. The rest of the world was at their service. It is not worth increasing production if no one buys products - - so fashion spurred the industrial revolution. In the 19th century, fashion already reached the working class. Even working women tried to keep up with fashion. "You can't put that. It's from last season." It was incomprehensible in the 16th and 17th centuries. At the time, it was thought it was still working. The fastest growing industry in the 19th century was Christmas. In the 18th and 17th centuries, Christmas was not celebrated very strangely. That's when we drank between friends and family - - but the gifts were given at the New Year at most. By the 1850s, we had Christmas candies, cards, and a Christmas tree. People went bankrupt to get Christmas - - and the manufacturers seized it as a way to make a lot of money. New technologies, railway, telegraph, mass production, large companies - - innovation and traditional production increased inequality. It was a time of huge conflicts. That was when there was an open war in the mines of Colorado - - between militias hired by strikers and capitalists. The U.S. military was used to end the strikes. Similarly, there is an economic transfer going on today... ... for trade and technology - - have the same opportunities to create monopolies. It is once again creating a small, very wealthy class. - 43 million. - 75 million. 107 million. Sold. Around 1914 in a city like Paris - - 1% of the population owned 70% of the wealth. Two-thirds of the population died without any wealth. Nationalism and competition between European countries are on the rise. It is partly due to strong social tensions - - due to stagnant living standards and inequality. Competition between countries, nationalism - - is often an elite way to make people forget class conflicts - - and focus instead on national identity. All this led to the outbreak of the First World War - - in the summer of 1914. In Berlin, the Germans know that a moment of glory is at hand. There was cultural militarism going on in Europe. The countries competed with each other for both regions and trade routes. The warlord tirelessly circles his troops. The British Empire had a quarter of the world’s population. Other countries wanted their share of the cake, especially Germany. Many of the new capitalists still thought feudally. Germany in particular had junkers, great industrialists - - who think nothing beats a decent fight. The British and the Allies believed in the German conquest - - be over in a few months. But it did last for years and destroyed the population of both. World War I was a battle for capital. It was followed by a huge economic collapse. It gave rise to a new idea, mainly due to the bankruptcy of the government - - that taxes can be a good thing - - and that the only way to get money is to tax the aristocracy. The working class and the middle class no longer had anything to tax. It marked the beginning of the end of the power of the aristocracy. The 1920s also saw an increase in the power of women and the working class. Both said to the government: "We fought and sacrificed. Give something back." Suddenly, the whole idea that the working class and women - - have to tolerate the conditions of society, were completely abolished. Follow the crowds to the city of miracles, the city of passion. Follow the crowds and make money. Earn properly. The 20th century was perhaps an absurd abundance. The shares went up, but they were still invested - - because the magic of Wall Street is always believed. We have a myth in this country - - that the interest of Wall Street is in the interest of the people, but it is not true. Many banks sold products they knew were bad. Vague bankers made obscure trades. There was hardly any legislation. The capital was free. The bubble of the 1920s was like many other bubbles. It was euphoria. The shares rose and they received a loan to buy the shares. The courses went up further and everyone was excited. At the same time, the labor market was going through a huge upheaval. Many got rich, but many were also at the bottom. Not so much in between. An attempt was made to close the gap with credit. Credit spiral bait 5 - which burst, like bubbles always. That time many bankers went to jail - - and changes were made to the legislation. In particular, the Glass-Steagall Act, which strengthened the banking system - - until it was repealed in 1999. After the economic crisis, many countries ended up in a trade war. Tariffs led to a snowball effect that increased suffering everywhere. It contributed to the Great Depression. If you read John Steinbeck's Fruits of Anger - - you understand the shock caused by the complete collapse of the economy. I was told to drive you away. From your own country? It's not my fault. Whose then? The land is owned by the Shawnee Land and Livestock Company. - Who is it? - No one. It's a company. I guess there's a leader out there who knows what a shotgun does? He is a mere leader who obeys the orders of the East Coast. - Then who are we shooting? - I can not say. If I could, I would tell. I don't even know who to blame. No one drives me away from my own country! My grandfather took this country 70 years ago. My father was born here. We were all born here. Some died. Banks collapsed one at a time. Everyone lost their savings. As a result, demand elsewhere decreased - - which led to bankruptcies and unemployment. UNEMPLOYED ANY JOB IS ELIGIBLE The great crisis of the 1930s caused such great trauma - - that the people and politicians - - accused capitalism of it. The suffering of the United States had grown into absolute poverty. As a result, they were ready for tough political solutions. This country is demanding action now. Price regulation, large changes in labor costs - - and all of Roosevelt's actions were completely new to the Americans. It led to the construction and redistribution of huge infrastructure. The existence of the communist alternative frightened the capitalists - - to think that if even some of the equality issues are not addressed - - they lose the war of idealism. Roosevelt borrowed some of the ideas from the New Deal - - such as strong state participation in the economy and regulations. It was understood that if the state does not try to increase jobs - - and prevent people from starving, there is no stability. The collapse of Wall Street created poverty in the US and Britain - - but its impact in Germany was enormous, as Germany was already poor. It had to pay compensation after the First World War. It caused huge inflation in the Weimar Republic. At worst, even a barrel of banknotes was not enough for bread. It can be directly linked to the rise of fascism and poverty in Europe. It is understandably tempting when Adolf Hitler comes and says: "I'm making Germany big and awesome again." Actually, he says that Germany is poor Britain - - Because of America and Europe. These trampled people are open to fascism - - racism, exclusionism and the conquest of other countries. No more class divisions! We will become one nation! And you, my young, are this people. One of many American aircraft factories. One bomber and thousands on the way. Angel of Death. The recession was overcome by turning the economy into World War II. Its scale was something unprecedented. The governments of all the countries took over the production. It was an industrial war, so production was the one under which - - the war would be won or destroyed. The labor movement gained a lot of political power. If you produced anything for the war, you had to recognize the union. Paying all of it required an increase in taxes. This era was the end of feudalism. It finally got the influence of the aristocracy out of the industrialized countries. Wars themselves are used to destroy capital. First, entire cities are destroyed by bombing. But only a third of the capital goes into it. Where do the other two-thirds come from? One third comes from inflation, which destroys public debt - - which was given to the citizens to finance the war. The second third consists of new rules - - such as rent regulation, nationalization and regulations. But the collapse of capital is not necessarily a bad thing - - because the power relations of society have changed. Everyone is equal in the face of death. Wars, death and despair - - there are times when we realize that we are all human. This new political context eventually led to - - enlightenment and equality, proclaimed in the 18th century. The social atmosphere was quite different after World War II. The change in attitude was greater than ever. It is different than before. We receive sickness and unemployment benefits, pensions - - compensation for accidents at work, widow's pension, maternity allowance... A social benefit system was created. There were sickness and holiday pay. In Britain, free health care was created for life. Industry nationalized - - and inheritances and property began to be taxed. It works just fine. Television with its entertainment promises is part of the peace deal. It combines private stimulation and public service. Capital was also constrained in America in the 50s. Rents were regulated and landowners were restricted. Capital was not allowed to rage freely and increase. It had to be tamed. This is a land of whole blood. It was thought that capital must help people. The idea that the free capital of the rich is in the interest of the people - - questioned worldwide. In the 50s, it was thought that everyone could get wealth. Immediately after World War II, those born had life - - which previous generations could not even imagine. For the first time, hard work and studies could help the top. Good day, Mrs. Thatcher. Go sit down. My father dropped out of school at the age of 12 or 13. He did not have opportunities for postgraduate studies like we did. Parents always try - - give their children opportunities they did not have. Would you like a female prime minister? Depends on who it is. I don’t think I’ll see a female prime minister in my lifetime. Thatcher represents incredible social mobility. She was the daughter of an ordinary merchant from the north. He visited Oxford. She became the first female prime minister as well as the rich. Social mobility was possible in the new society. The middle class and lower middle class dominated the positions of power. If we look at the development of inequality in the 20th century - - the most significant change is in the strong middle class. Until 1914, the middle class did not exist. It was almost as poor as the poorest. The next 30 years of the war, during which the economy began to rise - - were a time of increasing purchasing power - - especially for low-income and middle-class people. They were able to increase consumption and improve their standard of living - - as well as saving for your own house and raising capital. The kitchen comes here so we can see the children playing in the yard. Junior? How many do you want? Hopefully no more than six. They are not very rich nor completely poor - - but they still have national capital. In recent decades, middle-class wealth has declined - - strongly in the USA and less strongly in Europe. We have clearly gone in a different direction - - which can be worrying considering the 21st century. One of the biggest challenges is the shrinking middle class - - and the risk of it becoming a poor middle class as before. The decades that followed World War II were significant. The war effort led to a great social consensus. We had solidarity - - but it was based on a stratified society. There were other forms of inequality. It began to change in the 1960s with the civil rights movement - - and other subsequent social movements. WE MARCH WITH SELMA! Blacks are still not free. I think it is politically important that the middle class is broad. According to modernization theory, when incomes rise, the middle class emerges. It is better educated and therefore wants to be more involved. Then everything erupted in the 70s. You will be watching NBC’s evening news on Wednesday, October 17th. Good evening. The war in the Middle East is now affecting the whole world. Oil-producing countries made oil a political weapon. In Kuwait, it was announced that the price of oil would rise. It was voted on at night. It will take until Israel withdraws. The oil crisis hit all industrialized countries. Oil was used for everything. Gas-free Sundays start next month. The price of foreign oil rose from 3 to 12 dollars. Quadrupling the price of oil - - led to an increase in prices, but wages did not keep up. Unions began demanding higher wages due to rising prices - - when companies raised prices further due to wages. This gave rise to a price and wage spiral - - and followed an era of high inflation and low growth. It is called stagflation. Globalization was about to begin. Emerging markets were coming. Europe was back on its feet, and Germany began to produce again. The global picture changed. US capital was no longer in control. The 1970s also saw - - a very isolated way of thinking about the balance sheet. Costs were cut. Labor was seen as a cost, not a resource. No investment was made in employees. Wages were not raised. It began to give rise to the big X, with Wall Street moving in a different direction. Germany and Japan went the other way. Employees sat on company boards and were allowed to participate. It brought great benefits. Utilization of expertise - - increased efficiency and gained market share from US companies. When it started, the US was not prepared. Small cars came across the sea to change the country’s buying habits. Nice car. What is the name of it? - Isuzu. - Cheers. They cross the road, beat the heart, whirl... Cadillac, Subaru! Reagan as president. Japanese car production is almost double that of the US. We used to be the world's largest car manufacturer. That is no longer the case. Every country wants to tell why it is richer than the others - - or why it is impoverished. That story Reagan and Thatcher told their peoples. Thanks a lot. Can anyone look at our diminished power in the world and say: "Let's take another four years of this"? No! If you have lost your hope, we will restore it - - and take us on a crusade to make America great again. In the United States, it was felt that Germany was - as well as Japan. These were the countries that lost the war. Reagan and to some extent Thatcher used it to say: "These countries are catching up with us. Something needs to change. What?" "This is because of the New Deal welfare state model." "It has made us weak." "We must return to 19th-century mythical capitalism" - - "to regain our strength." From there comes Prime Minister Rover Mrs. Thatcher on a ride. Margaret Thatcher, daughter of a food retailer - - studied with the privileged at the University of Oxford. We have work to do. To increase the value of our assets so that we can increase our investment - - and free up capital - - the power of the workforce had to be suppressed. THE LABOR PARTY DOES NOT WORK Here is some of the two-week rubbish that is outside the landfill. It has been closed for two weeks due to a garbage drivers strike. The teachers ’union demands salaries. 33,000 pupils are out of school in Haringey, London. Canceled surgeries appear as empty beds. It must be remembered that the strikes were problematic at the time. The people did not like how some unions behaved. I cook everything because the sewer workers are on strike. The water is contaminated and can cause typhoid fever. Can't I? Something had to be done against the power of labor against capital - - and it's not easy. The government has moved state borders backwards and still does. Millions have already bought shares - - British Gas, British Airways and our country's airports. Flight 307 has been canceled so far. Hostility to trade unions began in the 1980s. It condensed when Reagan fired air traffic controllers. For those who did not come to work in the morning: If you do not come to work within 48 hours, your employment will be terminated. Nothing else. It was like a green light for the whole industry. President Reagan has begun dismissing the strikers. The government said it was ready to operate without them. Five union leaders have been imprisoned. It is important to understand that inequality has increased - - because of the money generated in the economy - - workers are receiving an ever smaller share. The share of wages is declining. The return margin, ie the amount of capital that owners receive - - is growing. It is basically about power. Thank you for this opportunity, Mr Cromwell. You allowed Teldar Paper's largest shareholder to speak. America has become a second-class power. In free market times, when our country was an industrial power - - was liable to the shareholders. Carnegie and Mellon, empire builders, liked it concerns - - because it was their money. I mean, in the absence of a better word, greed - - It's good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed, say what I said - - rescues not only Teldar Paper, but also a company called USA. Thanks a lot. When Gordon Gekko gave his "greed is good" speech - - it was intended to be a protest against the system. But the culture had changed so much - - that for some recent graduates applying for jobs in banks - - it became a license to seek wealth. The time of the Juppis began. It was great to be an entrepreneur and ride this wave crest. Demanding a high level of taxation and wealth distribution was old-fashioned. Banking regulations began to be dramatically deregulated. Bankers' salaries rose - - and the liberation of market forces made the capitalists rich. Major reforms of the Reagan and Thatcher period - - reduced the taxation of the rich - - and it was expected to have a runoff effect, which, however, did not come. It was immediately clear that such a policy would increase inequality. The promise was that the pie would be bigger. There was a lower percentage of the bigger pie - - which would lead to a bigger piece. In a sense, then, there was no surprise - - that inequality increased. But it increased much more than expected. When we look at the figures, we see it very clearly. The lowest 90 percent had almost come to a standstill. Most of the growth had gone to the top 10 percent. Median income of a typical American economy - - was roughly the same as 25 years earlier. Actual wages in relation to inflation - - were at the level of 60 years ago. Life expectancy had fallen. These saw that the economy was not to the benefit of the Americans. In the 1990s, American banks took American capitalism - - Europe and Asia. Our version was sold to everyone - - unregulated, free-flow capitalism. Life seemed to get better in the 1990s. System globalization - - lowered the price of goods for ordinary people. Credit came on top of it. When the credit boom started, ordinary people got credit. Suddenly, even poor people got credit. - You can search... -... by phone. Likewise, those with a lousy credit history. Completely wrong people got a mortgage. Investment banks created increasingly exotic credit derivatives - - in which bad credit was replenished and its badness concealed. It kept the system running until it collapsed in 2008. There is panic on Wall Street. How did this happen? 22 percent of homeowners are unable to repay their loans. The American dream is under threat. ... higher interest rates... Let's see. Last abbreviation. 37 percent interest per minute, incomprehension of the contract... Here is your new monthly installment. When you gave me the money, you said I would only pay in the future. This is not the future! This is now! Calm down. This country takes care of the middle class. FORCED AUCTION TODAY Don't be angry with the banks. We fired the manager. He barely got 50 million. Banks are not afraid to lend each other money. - The credit market is frozen. - Fear grows. There was a fear that I thought was justified - - the loss of access to credit, as well as the possibility to make transfers - - withdraw cash or use a credit or debit card. The worst weeks since the 1929 collapse. - Dow Jones fell... - Japan fell nearly 10 percent. The British government blamed US bankers. As it began to erupt, there became concern about how widespread it would spread. Are we on the brink of another great recession? American taxpayers heard that their money makes up... -... a big support package. - It must not fail. $ 7.7 trillion was lent to banks. The market strengthened. The news raised the rate by almost 60 percent. - Hong Kong more than 8 percent... - Rates rose 15 percent. The companies came and said: "Give me $ 700 billion, or everything you love will turn into shit." And in return for this money, which is by no means a ransom - - Americans now own shit. There was no collapse. The system survived - - and the opportunity to reform it properly was set aside. Stock prices fell sharply and then rose sharply. In addition, wealthy people are involved in the stock market. They kept their jobs and bonuses. Their companies did not suffer. They made more money through stock appreciation and dividends. Bloomberg estimates that banks earned 13 billion on this. Growth was 39 percent. 17 major banks gave their executives $ 1.6 billion in bonuses. Wall Street and its views had gained power. It was a silent coup. Democracies in general are prone to being abducted by the elite. Unless other sections of society renew it in between - - democracy continues in this direction - - where power and wealth are increasingly concentrated. There are oligarchs all over the world who buy political power. THESE ELECTIONS ARE NOT FOR SALE When capital is too concentrated - - it leads to excessive influence in the media - - and the financing of their political campaigns and parties - - who best support them. "One dollar, one vote" - - is completely contrary to the "one man, one voice" principle of democracy. Rationally, the more a person has - - the more he would be willing to share it - - but studies do not point in this direction. We brought guests to the lab two at a time. The coin dictated which one became rich and which one became poor. The rich player got twice as much money. He was allowed to roll both dice, so he moved faster. Each time he passed through the starting screen, he received $ 200. The poor only got $ 100. The inequality was clear to the players almost from the beginning. The dynamics began to stand out in a matter of minutes. - How many five hundred do you have? - Only one. Really? I have three. The rich player started behaving differently. They became dominant. The rich ate more fat. As they moved around the game board, they were louder. They started banging the game board with their piece. I buy the whole board. - They were clearly more rude. - You can't afford it. They started talking about how well they were doing. - Life is sweet. - They downplayed the plight of others. You will soon lose all your money. - They lacked compassion. - I'll buy it. The results were consistent among hundreds of players. They won just because of the coin - - but they behaved as if they deserved to win. I seemed to have made good investments. Among other things, we asked, "Why did you win the game?" One could imagine that the answer would be, "Because I won the coin." "I got double the benefits." But none of the rich players - - did not thank good luck for his success - - which randomly gave him a good starting point in the game. People who feel they deserve their own success - - are more likely to put their own interests above others - - and sabotage the well-being of others in order to gain an advantage for themselves. It is a rather detrimental social consequence. These are not rich people - - but that the experience of relative superiority - - seems to affect everyone in the same way. Jes! We won the lottery! - Oh my God. What is that? - Golden suit. I had to fight this over with three rappers. We are not like that. I'm afraid money will change our family. I wished you were quiet. When we really make poor people feel rich - - the results are again the same. Our former problems are gone. Bills don't worry us - - and we don't have to save. We can only have fun. Interested? Oh God. This is wonderful. Is it a blood diamond? - Yes. The children murdered each other. - It is lovely. The experience of being wealthier is changing our minds - - that we are better than others. The brain understands that. When we have people who have always flown first class - - and lived in a safe bubble - - and have villas in different countries to which they can move - - what happens to taxation? Much of the wealth is transferred abroad. People and businesses have been moving themselves for decades - - to avoid paying taxes from which their subordinates benefit. When you step out of a big IT company - - and you fell, hit your head and lay on the sidewalk in a pool of blood - - the taxes of the company have not paid the ambulance that will. It is a new system in capitalism. It cannot continue. The state must get - - through taxes, their share of the income of the rich. The EU has ordered the Irish government - - collect nearly $ 15 billion in taxes from Apple. 15 billion is more than the four-year cuts in Ireland. Amazon’s tax breaks are illegal. Facebook paid less corporate tax than the teacher. 98,000 companies do not pay tax. - The rich avoid taxes. - Google, Microsoft, Facebook... It works better for major shareholders than for ordinary people. Especially large technology companies can transfer people and money. They fly 10,000 meters above national problems. They create fewer jobs than the big industrial companies before - - but want more money. It’s ironic that everything that makes a smartphone smart - - Internet, GPS, touch screen technology - - created with our tax money in government agencies - - but wealth does not flow back into the ecosystem. Ireland pays Google Netherlands Holding BV. - Is it for tax reasons? - I believe so. So it goes to Google Holdings Ireland, which is in Bermuda? In that case, your winnings will go to Bermuda. Google Alphabet announced in 2015 - - to make $ 15.5 billion in profits in Bermuda - - but nothing really happens in Bermuda. This is an example of how states steal taxes from each other. Another way is through wealth management. It sells front companies and numbered accounts - - protected by banking secrecy, for wealthy families. What cannot be measured cannot be taxed. So we live in a statistical fog over it - - who has money or real estate in New York and Paris. When we review information, we come across cover companies. The fight against tax havens is simple. We need sanctions against tax avoidance areas - - and we need to change the way we calculate taxable profits. For example, Apple. Imagine Apple making $ 50 billion in profits globally - - and 10% of its sales took place in France. France would then indicate - - that 10% of Apple's global profit, 5 billion - - must be taxed in France. The great thing about the system is that companies can manipulate the winning countries - - but not the location of their customers. Their customers are in France, Germany, Britain, USA. Globalization has opened up a global society - - but it also allows companies to relocate jobs - - and make a lot of money with it. At the same time, the working class and the middle class, which did well - - have lost quality of life and opportunities. Their governments and companies - - have done very little, if anything, to address it. Due to globalization, the US and Europe are highly divided. India, the Philippines and China are not. The Chinese believe that hard work guarantees a better life for children. That’s probably true, but it’s no longer in the United States. If you go to Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai or Guangzhou - - to any wealthy Chinese city... Income is higher in Shanghai than in Portugal. There you will meet middle class Chinese. I mean global middle-class Chinese. It’s a whole different China than the one we saw 10 years ago. China is already almost the world's largest economy. Soon it will be, but it is state capitalist. State capitalism means that state-owned enterprises - - are the most important factors in the economy. They are trying to make money and build themselves - - and sometimes compete against each other in a fairly controlled manner. Private, state-approved companies are also involved. They are actively supported by the state and benefit from it. Then there are hundreds of millions of poor people. They still want state capitalism - - as long as they earn enough to make the children do better. Average income in China since the late 1970s - - has increased by about 800%. That is a huge increase. But the income of the richest 1 percent has grown by 2,000 percent. So it's a growing country - - but its growth is very unequal. China shows what liberalized capital does to income distribution. Capital really needs to be regulated much more tightly than other things. Capital market liberalization - - and there is a big difference between the liberalization of trade, products and services. It was one of the most important doctrines of the Great Depression. Modern capitalism is the free movement of global capital. The economic system has changed over the last 40 years. The share of the financial sector in the economy has doubled. It has created slower growth, not faster. When Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism - - thought of the free market, - he lived in a very different world. Why start a company? I just need capital, support and an idea. Small and medium-sized family businesses were the norm. You can't get a decent hat from the whole village. Why not? Women's hats! My company! He believed that the market was only a middleman. They had to deposit everyone's savings in banks - - and then lend them to a local hairdresser. It was a kind of banking utopia. Smith couldn’t even imagine a bank that was too big to fail - - or a large multinational company doing business in 120 countries - - all of which have different legal acts. This is a completely different world. Statistics show that only 15% of money - - which comes from financial corporations goes into productive loans. Where does the remaining 85 percent go? They are just moved around in this closed chain. It is property that is bought and sold by the same people - - whose assets are only growing. It is easier for the rich to keep wealth away from risk. That creates a new social story. It is easier to build a property. Maybe some of the apartments will be left empty - - but its value will rise so much in five years - - that the company can sit on the assets and hope for an increase in value - - instead of trying to earn by taking a risk - - setting up a factory or inventing something new. If you own a house, you earn a lot more than you work. People have become real estate speculators. It will completely change the whole housing situation. Eventually it starts to share. Young people are particularly affected by the current housing crisis in the West. Many see it as a struggle between generations. Large age groups benefited from buying houses when they were cheap - - and they therefore have a nice nest egg for retirement. Young people cannot even rent cheaply. Those at the bottom are angry. Houses earn more than they do, and they have to rent them. The poor and the middle class can only hope - - that the value of their home goes up so much - - that it overcomes other problems, such as the loss of a pension - - unemployment or child poverty. Young people are inherently more optimistic - - but know they got worse cards. Why do we have to take on £ 50,000 in debt because of education? Many feel they have become children. Why does my smart 26-year-old wire still have to live at home? It is wondering both he and my in-laws. We have said to people, "You are not poor." "You are future millionaires. Don't think about inequality." "Just focus on throwing jobs and running up the hill." That is ironic. Inequal societies have less social mobility. The steps of the ladder move away. Those with money make sure they stay on top. It makes climbing harder for others. It can be seen over and over again. The system is faulty. People are not stupid. They realize it. In practice, the economy is becoming more productive - - but the profits go to a very small number of people. Job growth is in the low-wage sectors - - where the work is neither lucrative nor interesting. The labor market is changing. People are increasingly employing themselves. So companies no longer pay holiday pay or pensions - - and people have to take care of themselves if they get sick - - or want to take a vacation. When Piketty says that the future of capitalism - - is highly unequal and socially immobile - - It's already here. America will see the largest division of wealth in history - - when the generation that earned after the Second World War - - transfer wealth to their children. The next generation will receive about $ 12 billion - - over the next 10-15 years. It is invested so that it generates more wealth. It is very likely that inheritance will become in the 21st century - - as important as in 19th century England and France. Heritage allows a small proportion of the population - - live a luxurious life - - for inherited wealth is income. The return on capital has almost always been - - greater than economic growth. If we look at the 18th century - - the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, and 2018 - - the world economy has grown by 1.6% a year for 300 years. It's much less than a capital injection - which is about 4 to 5%. Is it a disaster? Not necessarily. If everyone owned part of the capital - - and if everyone had their own home and a retirement savings account - - it would not be a bad thing that the return on capital is higher than the increase. The problem is the concentration of ownership - - and with it the concentration of power in society. It will lead to the return of social hierarchies - - and growing tensions among the working class and the middle class. Studies show that in industrialized countries - - two thirds will be poorer than their parents. That is a huge political trend. People on the streets are starting to get enough. Scatter, or we will have to use force! They have had enough of inequality and hopelessness. They grab the closest thing they can hold on to. It is often their identity, ethnicity and religion. And they attack the nearest enemy. Huge amounts of unskilled labor are coming to our country. They bring drugs and crime with them. They are rapists. Behind mass immigration is Islam. Behind mass immigration is terrorism. But it doesn't help. Prosecuting a neighbor does not make you richer. There are always politicians who are attracted to - - exploit growing inequalities. It was seen before 1914. I am afraid of the beginning of the 21st century. We cannot regulate international capitalism - - so we cannot properly tax companies and billionaires. Instead, we target our anger at immigrants. It's safer. But to address the persistent rise in inequality - - we must tax capital progressively. Nor can ownership be eternal. When the capital is inherited and every year when it is owned - - those who own a lot must give back - - 1, 2, 3 percent or why not 5 or 10 if owning billions. If you invest capital wisely and profitably - - can continue a successful life. But if the financial markets allow high returns without doing anything - - it must be crumbled by taxation. This is how we can control the concentration of capital - - and thereby political power - - as well as middle-class ownership. WE MEET AGAIN Many do not want to discuss strong income and inheritance taxation - - but if we do not regulate capitalism in this way - - its consequences are catastrophic for everyone. If we think long-term - - must think of horses. We used to have a lot of horses. Horses were critical to industrialization and then did not. Industrial processes are much more efficient than horses. For technophiles who say technology has always created jobs - - and will therefore continue to create, I say: "Technology has created jobs" - - "as long as there is work that people can do." But as technology begins to interfere with people's core business... ... then people become like horses. That doesn't mean we can't live a meaningful life anymore - - but the model must be changed, because capitalism is no longer a labor force. The problem is that this is going to happen soon. When we look at cars that don’t need a driver... By the way, transportation services are the second largest employer in the US - - in all 50 states. These jobs will disappear in 10 years. So we need to address capital - - because otherwise we will have very serious problems. We will leave the industrial economy and move on to the post-industrial economy. We need to choose what future we will end up with. We may have very unequally distributed wealth. Robots can do anything - - but only a small part owns robots. As with Elysium: some live in ecologically protected areas - - and the rest in a rotten mess. That is a political problem. Modern challenges for an equal society - - are, of course, different from those of the 20th century. I want to emphasize that it is not technically impossible. It is mainly a political and intellectual challenge. The good news is that history gives us cause for optimism. If we want a united, harmonious society - - we must not allow inequality to grow too great. I am in favor of controlling capital and overcoming capitalism... ... in more democratic ways in which everyone can participate - - and that allow us to see ourselves in the 21st century.
