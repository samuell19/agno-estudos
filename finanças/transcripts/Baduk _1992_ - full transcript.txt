This won't benefit me. What 'benefit'? You paid nothing! You found them in the desert! I did a mistake by speaking the truth. Go and don't speak about it. Hello, Alkhalid!

Whatever I've is from you. Tell me the purpose. I've got goods for you. How old are they? Not both. Only one of them. Why is that Sattar? One of them is a girl I've brought for myself. Ok. How much for the boy? I paid 5 Toman. Any thing more suits me. You're doing wrong Sattar. I made a mistake that I told you. Is he healthy? Solid, solid. Don't you worry. Take this. I'll bring him.

People shouldn't cheat him. Are you Abdullaha?s hireling? No. Whoever works for him for a few days becomes bonded. No, no! Are you Abdullaha?s relative? No. Abdullah has no relations with his family. What does it mean? After some days you'ld understand everything. Relax. Work for some days and you know all. Sattar! Where is Sattar? I've no idea about Sattar. Must be in some part of the hell. Sattar! Sattar! Sattar! Sattar! Sattar! You rascal! Stop! Stop! Come in. Come. I knew you'ld return. Look. Whatever's happened to this boy is his own fault. No problem. Little blood only. Don't repeat what you did today dear Jafar. Anyone who goes from here either returns himself or is brought back. Understood? Take it Jafar and wear this. You will catch cold. Now go to the boys. Go. Where're you till now? Go near the fire, warm yourself. I told you hundred times but you didn?t listen. What're you doing? Are you blind? You don?t know the stuff they carry I ask for. Ha? I don?t have hundred eyes to look at all of them. Pity! If you don?t have! You've no skills! Why do I need you?? - to take care of boys. Go! Ghulam. I heard you brought a cigarette carton and sold it yourself. Get in! Get in! Hurry up! Hurry! Cilmb! Get in!... Any news? - Not yet. Where else are you searching? - Around the village. Perhaps Sattar brought her here. I don?t know. Anything Sattar says I do. Sad, that I got arrested otherwise I would've found her. Arrested? For what? To do schooling. My father says I must study. School? It is closeby and open 24 hrs. My father says I must go there. They pay salary also. Salary! For what? - To help us study. It's better, you free yourself from work. My father tells the same. He is thinking about himself since... the day my mother died. He wants an excuse to get married. I must go to school from tomorrow. Otherwise he won't let me in. So I don?t see you again? I'll come and visit you. If you want, you come. My father'ld get you admitted in the school. No. What would happen to Jamal? This is the address of my school. Police! Police coming! Run away! Run! Hurry up!... Get down! They're searching. I'll stop after the police post. 15 minutes. If you get late I 'll leave. Get in. Get fast. Move! Come on! (conversation in Arabic at the back) Yusuf, Yusuf!

Ghafoor opened it? Yes. He took his share from this. What do you mean? His share? What did you do there? It is none of my business. Why are you fighting? Shut up! You arrogant boy! Why did Ghafoor open this package? It is none of my business. Stupid! Crazy! It is none of my business. Why should I be responsible for what you do? No my dear. We've no problem with each other. I simply ask you why did you permit Ghafoor to open this package? When I reached there, it was all finished. Ok! Ok! Tell me What did Ghafoor say to you. He said that he didn?t know there are drugs in it. Tell Abdullah that it is not principally fair that we work hard and he makes money. Now onwards, I will take my share. I have already taken it from Ghafoor. Ok. He did open the package and showed me.He said you are very innocent. If police finds the packet, we will just die. I will get that from him. I...I... I have confidence in you. From now onwards you are performing Ghafoor?s duties. I will not work again. You do because it benefits you Yusuf. Work for free. Strange? So you want a share? No problem. I pay your share. I will give you Ghafoor?s share. Ghafoor has taken his share. I know but the share I give you is different. It is different. If you don?t give my share, I know what to do. Be sure. We both know what to do. Go down now. What happened Yusuf? I heard some comversation. Nothing. You have time for all this? I want to know. Go and sleep. Yusuf, it's none of my business but I think you can help me. You can get the address from those people where they took my sister. You know them better than me. You know everything.
