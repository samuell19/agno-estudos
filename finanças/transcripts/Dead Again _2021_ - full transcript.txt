I know, I haven't got a script, is this my camera? Okay, okay. Hello, Kathy Perkin reporting live, now we're having technical problems here, please stand by. Hello, we seem to have lost picture, Dennis is pic, Dennis is picture up yet? Okay, no picture, no picture, okay. Okay, yes I can see it. Okay, yes I can see it. Still no picture, still not picture? Okay. Hello, this is Kathy Perkin with Channel 13's special news report. We're having some technical problems and some of you may only be receiving audio. I will continue. We have reports coming in from all around the world that we are under attack. I repeat, we are under attack. Please get to cover, get to a safe place, please, I repeat, we are under attack. It's just an incredible situation. There's never been anything like this. All over the world, we're seeing the devastating impact. I want as few lives lost as possible. Inside and keep it right here for the very latest. But this country is not alone. Prague invoking war, ordering people to stay home for at least 15 days except for essential activities such as grocery shopping or outdoor exercise. There'll be death. This is about borders, Germany brought in fresh controls this morning, dividing the continent. It's now going to turn towards the fight against this epidemic. They hit you like you got hit by a club. You're gonna need a bigger boat. What? You know? What? Come on you must know. I mean, I can just see a shark mask. Highest grossing film in 1975? I was born in the 90s. Hang on, this might help you get it. I don't know what that is. It's "Jaws", everyone on the planet knows "Jaws". I don't really know what you're doing, is it an initiation thing? You know, first day on the job and stuff? No, it's 'cause you've got the same name as Roy Scheider character. Master cinema survivor? Only one to survive the shark attacks, he blew it to smithereens. Oh, did he, okay. Oh come on, your name's Brody, same as Scheider's. Oh I can see you're gonna be a barrel of laughs, ain't ya? Well come on, what did you do to get lumbered in a place like this? No nothing, I mean there was a small incident. Tell ya what, don't worry. Grab ya coat, I'll give you the guided tour of Little Pitchfield. By the way son, what is your first name? Oh, do you really wanna know? Well yeah, I wouldn't have asked otherwise. Around here, we're all on first name terms. It's Bruce. Bruce? What? Name of the shark in the film, it was Bruce. Was it really? I thought I was named after my uncle. Police Sergeant Cooper? Police Sergeant Cooper. Starsky. What? My first name, Starsky. Starsky? Yeah, apparently I was conceived during the very first episode. Good old Mum and Dad, God rest their souls. They loved that show. Oh what show? Only the greatest cop show ever seen on TV. I don't know it. "Starsky and Hutch"? First aired in 1975. I was born in the 90s, remember? Sorry. It was awesome. I mean, they had girls, guns, oh cars! What more could you want from a show? I mean they had this Ford Grand Torino painted red and it had this fantastic white stripe down the side of it. It was awesome. Well I'll have to look it up then, Starsky. No, Starsky. Yeah? You fell for the oldest trick in the book, the old fake name joke. It's not Starsky, it's Shaun. Oh you are gonna be a barrel of laughs aren't you? We're gonna wind you up rotten. Come on, son. This place must have been beautiful in its heyday. I think it was an old hospital for the criminally insane. You'd have fitted in perfectly then. You think? Yes, you're a rogue, a cad, a bandit. English lit is your thing then. Anyway, I thought women love a rogue. Not if the man's a prick. I just wish we could explore this place. Come on then. We shouldn't. Why not? Someone could be in there and then what? There's nobody around, the place is abandoned. People 'round here are backwards. Come on, it's like going back in time. And they never locked the doors. All right but I'm not having sex with you, if that's your caddish plan. Come on. Definitely not like London. Phone booths work. There she is, in all her glory, the church. Even the vicar only had one follower and that was his cleaner. Come on Bruce, let's go and see if we can drum up a generation gap. Are you always this comical? I thought that on this job you have to be, you have to be vigilant all the time. Vigilant? You'll soon find out nothing happens 'round here. Well, my training taught me to be prepared for anything and everything at any time, day or night, on duty or off. Well, I tell you something they aint prepared you for. What's that? Boredom, sheer boredom. Nothing happens 'round here. It's like a morgue in a recession. Well, then maybe we need to go out and find crime, you know, I mean it happens it everywhere. They say it's just hidden behind closed doors. I used to be just like you when I first started, keen. And how long ago was that? If you don't mind me asking. 25 years. Actually, I've been in Little Pitchfield for 24 and half now and this is it. Rush hour. I know everybody 'round here, all their ins and their outs and all their dirty laundry and believe me, Mrs. Broomfield at the vicarage she's got some very dirty underwear. Right, okay, yeah. A bit sexist that, isn't it? Sexist? No. That's why you're P.C. Brody, stop being so PC, Bruce. Well government guidelines suggest that we should actually investigate all hate crime initiators, so. It's like living in the past. No one cares about political connectiveness. They just go about their lives as normal. Same old boring thing day after day after day. There's must be some crime. Otherwise that would mean Little Pitchfield is literally a crime free location. Let me tell you something. Little Pitchfield has been off every crime report and statistic in the last 17 years. No, no really, really. I read about it somewhere. Something about us making the good cops look bad. So they just leave us off now. Hang on. Brody, wait! Excuse me, sir. You do realise that public urination is a offence under the Public Order Act of 1986 and as such that can be considered indecent exposure. Nicely said, son. There's no crime here. Billy. What have I told you about peeing up that tree? Sorry, Shaun. Go on, son. Go about your business. What you do that for? That, that's an offence. Public urination. Look around. What public? Anyway, he always gets it wrong. So hang on wrong? Yeah, he's peeing up the wrong tree. What? Yeah, the peeing tree is four down on the left but he's a bit thick in the head, bit of a simpleton. The government guidelines suggest we call that a disability, actually. Disability? He just doesn't know his left from his right. Do you do anything by the book? All depends what book it is. The Police Handbook, the guidelines. Ah, there it is, the bloody guidelines. Let me tell you something about the guidelines, they're only put there 'cause someone can't make a decision between what's right and what's wrong. Ah, ah, ah. Until it's no longer a guideline. See, I can do whatever I want when I want because 'round here, I'm the boss, number one and if you think some snotty nose, pencil pushing guideline and your PC is gonna come into my neck of the woods and tell me what to do, well then you've got another thing coming. Well do you get me? Yes, sir. Well do ya, punk? Yes, sir. Did you get it? Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry. Yeah, I think I've seen that one. See, can you imagine what it's like to be Detective Callahan? Chasing down suspects, hunting them down and shooting the bastards. That was my dream. 17 years. Huh? You said that statistically Little Pitchfield has been off the police records for 17 years, so what happened 17 years ago? Now that, my boy, is another story. So, what happened? Well, the villagers said it was some sort of alien invasion. Right, okay another one of your jokes. No, no, no, no. This is no joke. It was the last time anything interesting happened around here. See, it was Guy Fawkes night. We could see the fireworks off into the distance. Did I tell you we haven't got a fireworks display around here? Just haven't got enough people. Anyway, we could see it in Great Pitchfield about three miles away. I mean, it was a really clear night and I remember because there was me, Billy, Drake, Bob, Sandra, Ellen, Sally and Bernard. Yeah, Bernard. See now, Bernard was trying to hump Sally all night long, right in front of us. We kept telling him to leave it out but he just humped away to his heart's content all night. In fact, I think he even missed the fireworks. Sorry, Bernard is? Bernard's an afghan hound and Sally's a shih tzu. Hang on, hang on. You thought they was? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. Anyway, where was I? Fireworks. Oh yeah, yeah, the fireworks. Listen, Sandra and Bob were looking out into the distance and to the left of the fireworks, Bob could see this bright white light. Well he did point it out to me, come to think of it, but I just dismissed it. I thought it was just, you know, other fireworks. But anyway, listen, all of a sudden there was a power surge. The whole village went out and back on again. Well, Sally and Bernard stopped humping and started howling. That made me look across the field and there was this bright white light. We could all see it, this one, and all of a sudden it just and it was gone but in a completely different direction to the fireworks. You know, I mean, those lights could have been anything, right? Yeah, maybe. Guess we'll never know now. Other strange things happened that night. It was, everyone had something stolen from properties, you know. I mean, Hanson reported it but everyone got something stolen. Never did catch the bastards that stole my scooter. Uh, scooter? Yeah, yeah you know. Oh like a moped. - Yeah. - Oi, oi, oi. Don't ever call a scooter a moped. I'll give you a slap next time. Anyway, there was one good thing come out of that night. See, Sally had the strangest puppies that you'd ever seen. Puppies, right. See, told you this place was okay. I guess. It's both a beautiful and a really sad place. Sad? Looking at it now, I can imagine what it once might have been but then all those years of neglect and loneliness. It must have been amazing when it was full of life. Now, it just looks like my grandma, just hanging in there. You do have a way with words. I could see you becoming a great novelist one day. Yeah? What sort of books would I write? Romantic ones for sure. Really? You see me as a Mills & Boons novelist? Possibly. Am I a graphic novelist? I doubt that. I saw you when Catherine got that nosebleed last year. You were hysterical. You saw that? Uh huh. She was bawling her eyes out. And so the male brain gets it wrong yet again. Hmm? I wasn't hysterical because of the blood. I was upset for my friend. She had a date that night and she got blood all down her blouse. It was the one she was gonna wear on the date. I see, okay, so. It could be graphic novels. All I know is you've got a pretty mind. Pretty mind? That could almost be considered flirting. Men don't flirt. No, they don't, I agree. They make it too obvious. I know exactly why you've brought me here and what you want. And why is that? The question isn't why. The question is answered just by my being here. What was that? Yeah, I heard that. Listen. Sounds like crying. Like a woman crying. We should leave. No, I want to see what that is. I don't like this. That sounded like death itself. Whatever it is it sounds weird and pissed off. I think we should leave. No, I need to know what that is. What is it? Don't come up here. What is it? Dan? Dan. Dan! What? Something is watching us. What is that? I have no idea. What do we do? Run. Run. Run! Bloody kids. Fuck. So what we got here, then? I can't believe you've never heard of the film Jaws. It was a Spielberg masterpiece. Do you know it took 159 days to make that film 'cause the shark just wouldn't work. What films you into, anyway? Calling PS Cooper, PS Cooper, are you there? Yeah, receiving, over. Breaking and entering reported at Little Pitchfield Manor. Suspects on site, I see one male, and I see one female. Also reports of IC9 in location. Yeah, on route. What's on IC9? IC9 is unknown. Oh right. Where's Little Pitchfield Manor? Just 'round the corner. - There? - Yeah. Come on. Oi, what are you doing? I'm going in. No, hang on. I've got to get my breath back, first. Are we going in or not? Hang on. Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. I just got here. Got scared, didn't want to go inside in case there are dangerous criminals. 'round here. Anyway, you would of scared them all away, Ellen. It should be okay, now. Bob has them cornered in the library. Come on. Hang on. Where'd you say they was? Library. Excuse me, sorry. Madam, thank you. I've got 'em. I've kept them safe. They're not gonna go anywhere. You can count on me. You can always count on me. Nice work, Bob. Sir, if you could just put that weapon down for me, sir. - Shaun, Shaun. - Sir, sir. It's all right, it's okay. I think it's outrageous that you come onto my property. I'll take it from here, Ellen. Now, I don't recognise yous two. Names. I'm Dan, this is Katie. Ah Great Pitchfield by the looks of em, I would say. Yeah, look like a couple of wrongens to me, as well. Did you see it? See what? The thing in the woods. It was chasing us. Oh, funny. Very funny. Bob is this, Ellen did you put him up to this? Is this someones birthday or something? This deadly serious. This is fucking serious. Excuse me, sir. Have you or Katie found yourself taking any illegal substances today? No. Have you checked the grounds? It was chasing it. It attacked Dan. This is pathetic. What attacked you? Some thing. We heard it. Yeah, we were on the grounds, we admit that. We heard a noise in the woods, we went to investigate it. Oh, you don't do that. What? Well, if you've ever seen any horror film you know you never ever investigate. You get our ass cheeks out there as soon as possible. I agree with Bob. Can we please stick to the facts? Tell me what happened. Uh, well it was, it was, it was like. It was like. You need to tell them. They won't believe us. Try us. Okay. It looked like a zombie. Oh that wee Billy. Probably. I think, I think what they're referring to is the IC9 reported to be in the vicinity. IC9, is that police code for zombie? No. It means unknown. What I think this is, sir, is a clearly a case of mistaken identity. We were chased by this thing. Are you in charge here? And what makes you say that, little lady? You are Police Sergeant Cooper. Oh, you've heard of me, have you? Yeah, my uncle works in traffic police and we've heard of you and this shitty little hamlet. In Great Pitchfield, you were voted the most incompetent sergeant in the whole district. Go that far? You need to know what we understand what we witnessed here. I think you need to tell us what is going on. You need to describe the individual for us. Person, they were lying down. Put it this way, all their insides, yeah, they were on the outside. Right, you've described that person as a person, why not a man or a woman? 'Cause it was so mutilated. I couldn't tell, all right. I think we need to do a perimeter search and I think we need to do one now. Yeah, I think you're right. Do you have any weapons? No, we don't carry firearms. That's a specialist unit does. I got weapons. You're not really listening to this drivel, are you? So. So, what was the award for? What? Well, the most incompetent police sergeant in the district. What's wrong? Whatever it is, I've just seen it. Where? It was just staring at me. Evil eyes. Do you need them weapons? Weapons. Yous all stay here. Bob, we'll talk about those weapon later. I've got tonnes of them in the greenhouse. Did you lose it? There are no weapons. What do they look like then? Run, run. Brody, wait! Wait. Come on! Wait for me. Shit, go, go, go. Quick, help us. We've got people here. What? Get it up. What happened here? No, put your end down. Push it. Some chairs, some chairs. Okay, I'll block it up. Man, you said, you said nothing ever happens here, normally. It don't. That's not normal. Apart from that runaway a couple of days ago. What runaway? Hello, is anyone there? This is PC Brody. We need immediate backup at Little Pitchfield Manor. How many were there? Dozens of em. They just kept coming out the woods. What do you think it is? Zombies? I knew it. Our barricade's not gonna hold them for long. Jesus. Joe, do you hear me? It's Shaun Cooper. We're at the old manor house. Look, we need backup now. There's just dozens of them, like creatures. IC9s. IC9s, do you hear me, over. Well, what do we do now? We hold them off and we wait for backup. Yeah? Look, I agree. Better out than in. Oh please. I'm sorry, I just get nervous in these situations. We're all nervous. Just try to control yourself. Hey, it looks like they're gone. No, no I don't care. Okay, we stay here where we are safe and we wait for them to come and get us. So your whole plan is to sit and do nothing? Well it sounds like a great plan to me. It's been two hours and nothing. Calm down. It's gotta be some sort of chemical attack, it's got to be. If it was a chemical attack, why aren't we infected? What do you think? I don't know. Like I said, zombies. No, no about getting someone here to help. Okay, someone has to go and find a phone. No. Bob, do you have a landline here? In my room but that's over the other side of the manor. I'll go. No, they could still be out there. Well look, we can't risk it okay. I was my college record holder over 100 metre sprint. I will be in and out. I know where it is. Don't go. Stay here. Dan, Dan, Dan. Come back through the barricade, okay. - It's not safe out there. - I will be two minutes. I'll be right back. Fuck's sake. Well, at least the power's still on. Think they're still out there? Of course they're still out there. You should have stopped him. You should have made him stay. It's not within our remit to use force or aggression to control a situation. Okay, we deescalate. - Deescalate. - Yeah. PC Brody was only doing his job. You shut up. You wanted to press charges and now he's dead. Why don't you all shut up? It's the end of the world! I've seen it. I've seen it for nigh on 30 years. In my dreams and nightmares, this is it. What are you talking about? I'm telling you straight, I've seen it before, in visions. Nigh, it is out there. Nigh, it is waiting. Who? Them. So not zombies then? Zombies is like a picnic compared to this. 17 years ago, do you remember? 17 years ago they came a-looking, stalking like burglars looking 'round a house they're gonna raid. He's right. This aint no zombies. This aint gonna end. Nobody's coming to save us. We have to save ourselves. He's right. It's aliens! How can you be so excited? 'Cause for once in my life I get to be Sigourney Weaver. Look, I might just have a way of getting us out of this. Okay, so what's the plan then? Weapons, bloody loads of them. Bob, where are those weapons? Bob, Bob wait wait. What? Give me the weapon. It's mine. Now, I don't like this as much as you do but give me the weapon. Now stay behind me. Not that close. Absolute silence. That be good. Where are those weapons, Bob? In the greenhouse, out by the allotment. Come on. There it be. Wait, wait, wait. Is that one of the creatures? He looks buggered. No, they don't. Are we gonna go or what? Oh come on, Bob. We've all seen enough of them films to know it's not dead. It's just laying there waiting for us to approach and when we do it will be alive. I'll bash it with this. That won't work. It will still be alive. Are you gonna make a decision soon or others will come. All right, come on, let's do it. There it be. Thundercats! That's Billy. Can't be. We only seen him a few hours ago. That's definitely him. That means whatever's infected them is killing them in just a couple of hours. Thank you. It's them. They're coming for us now. It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be absolutely fine. Oi, Katie, what are you doing? I can get out. They're distracted with those two. I can get out. No, no, just, uh, don't move. You didn't stop Dan. Why would you stop me? Katie! Fuck's sake. What's wrong? It's my leg, it really hurts. Is it where Billy grabbed ya? No, no I scarped it on an old tree stump just now. Tell me the truth, Bob. Nothing happened. No it's not. It's where Billy, that creature, grabbed you and now you're infected. You're gonna turn into one of them monsters. It was just an old tree stump, I tell ya. You're lying! You don't believe me? If you turn into one of them things I'll blow your bleeding head off. I'm telling you the truth, believe me. Okay, come on. Brody, Brody! Brody. Brody! Oh, shit. Here, take this. We thought you were dead. Wait, where's Katie? - It's nothing. - She's gone. I couldn't stop her. What's happened? There's dozens of em. Look, I need to speak to you. One of them creatures was Billy. Billy? Pissed up the tree Billy? Yeah. That means this must be a virus and I'm guessing it's passed on by physical contact. Does that mean it could actually be a chemical weapon's attack? No, not in Little Pitchfield. Anyway, it's not airborne. All right, what weapons did we get? Let's do our weapon's check. Have you had any weapons training? Oh yeah. We had a weeks intensive combat training. Trust me, I know my way a few of these. How is he? We need a doctor. What now? Come here, I need to talk to ya. You know I said one of them creatures was Billy? We see him less than 24 hours ago. Yeah, well he was half dead before I killed him. This could only mean one thing. What? This aint just a virus. It's an annihilation. We're being exterminated. You promised me! I lied. Look, once you kill 'em, no more virus. No, what does that, what does that mean? It means we might just survive this. Listen, listen! It's down to us now. I know this was your first day and my last and I take back everything I said about nothing happening in this town but this is my town and I'm not retiring. I'm gonna make a stand for it, right here, right now! Are you with me? Fuck yes! Yeah, come on. Well come on! Shaun! Shaun! Shaun. Oh shit. Bat! They're still coming. Shaun! Hello, this is Kathy Perkin with a channel 13 special news report. Breaking live. All parts of the world are under attack from what appears to be alien spaceships. I cannot believe I'm saying this but reports coming in are that Toronto, New York, Paris, Moscow, and London have been attacked and many famous landmarks have been destroyed. Some world leaders have been killed. We can now see some footage. This is like a scene out of a war movie. It's total devastation and destruction. The humanity. We don't know how many causalities there have been but early estimates are it's in the thousands. This is not a drill. This is a warning from central government. Get away from the cities, go to a safe place in the country. Arm yourself if you can and be ready. They are coming. We're gonna need a bigger boat. So you have seen it then? Of course I have. Now let's give em hell. But this time, let's make it war.
