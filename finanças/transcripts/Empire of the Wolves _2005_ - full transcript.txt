Red... Blue... Fine, Anna. Now here are some shapes for you to describe. The Empire of the Wolves Square... Circle... Oval... Rectangle... Very good. Name the capital of each country. Spain. Madrid... - United States. - Washington. - Brazil. - Rio. No... Brasilia. Perfect. Last test. Faces will appear before you. Identify them, as fast as you can. Mao Tse Tung. JFK. Che Guevara. Napoleon. The Mona Lisa. Lincoln... Wait! Who was that? Stop! Answer me! It was Laurent. Your husband. So what do we do? - A biopsy? No way! - Anna... No one's cutting into my brain. Why all the guards? Radioactive products are controlled by the army. What products? Oxygen-15. The tracer they injected to observe your brain. Charming. It's harmless. Trust Eric. He's Europe's finest neurologist. I won't be his guinea pig. He only took your case as a favor to my family. - You siding with him? - We're all for you! What's happening to me? Dunno. We can't let it worsen. Worsen? He never said that. You're right. Sorry, that was silly. I love you. I don't want to become a stranger to my wife. When you saw my picture, your brain didn't react. PASTRY SHOP I'll pick you up at 7 PM. I can't face that dinner. Play host to your colleagues alone. They'll be really disappointed. Are you sure? What if my problems start all over again? Don't worry. You'll be fine. You OK? So? How did it go? - Not well. - How so? I lied. I couldn't tell them the truth. Why? What did you hide? It started a month ago. I passed Laurent on my way to the bathroom. He smiled. It startled me. I didn't know who he was. You're stressed out. Take a vacation with Laurent. But there's more... What is it? That's him! Shall I serve him? Hello. - What will it be? - Chocolate. 200 grams, as usual? - You still don't know who he is? - No. But I'm sure I know him. - Lf you did once know him... - Yes? Why doesn't he know you? I'm going crazy. That guy we busted at the airport... Because we tipped you off. A Saudi with a fake Turkish passport. Our dumb Foreign Service even knew him! All they do is talk shop! Aren't you bored, Anna? It's how they get rid of stress. I read that socializing boosts your immune system! Anna, tell me the name... of the hotel where you honeymooned with Laurent? La Paloma. Why? I'm taking a lady friend there for the Easter. It's funny, we've been friends for years, but I don't know how you met Laurent. We were in college and... Let your wife tell it. It'll be more interesting. Well... it was... Love at first sight. Really? I could swear he courted you for months! It's just stress. What's wrong, Anna? Excuse me. That wacko's still at it. Send the body to the Coroner. You thought about my idea? What'll you do? Keep combing the neighborhood? Sweatshops, hostels, bars? Your 3rd victim, and you don't have a lead. I got out the file on Schiffer. Know what they call him? I know: "Mr. Shifty." He's a bad cop. Schiffer may be rotten, but he ruled Little Turkey for 20 years. The cops call him "Mr. Shifty," but Turks call him "The Shaft." National Medal of Valor. You OK? Much better. Go back. I'm coming. They already left. I'm so sorry, Laurent. - I'd hate your colleagues to think... - That's no problem. Laurent... Why don't we have any kids? Excuse me? We've been married 8 years. Why don't we have any kids? You didn't want any. You made me swear to it, before we got married. I did? Why? Your whole memory is failing you. Don't hide things from Ackerman. Do the biopsy. Give me a few more days. There must be another way. Like what? I don't know. Just a few more days. OK... A few days. Rest Home You're too young for Internal Affairs. Capt. Nerteaux, CID, 10th precinct. - How's the nabe? - Like this. - What's that? - A Turkish seamstress. Around 25. Illegal. Body dumped in the sewers. So what? You once policed that area. She's the 2nd victim. The 3rd was as bad. What do you want? Your opinion on the case. I got scrapped. A scrapped cop's opinion is worthless. He smashed her feet. X-rays showed over 70 bone fragments in her flesh. He cut out her lips. He sliced up her breasts. And it gets worse. Sorry. I have responsibilities here. Just as well. Your file made me puke. I should've left it at that. "Shifty" Schiffer. How come Homicide's not handling it? They closed the case after murder No.1. I reopened it. Your first serial killer? Got an investigation team? No. Want to nab him alone, kid? Took you time to come see me. Pick me up tomorrow. Pick you up? You didn't read my whole file: They even took away my driver's license. Wanna search me, kid? It's all I'm packing. Only one cop's on active duty. That's me! And I'm not your "kid." Doctor, this is... Hi, Lopez. We've met. The victim is a Caucasian female. Her muscle tone says she's between 20 and 30. Like the first two, a redhead and short: Around 5 ft 3. - Tattoos? Henna? Pierced ears? - No. - Any seamstress marks? - She was a manual worker. Tell us about this. 27 slashes: The wounds get deeper. - The torture lasted for hours. - For hours? She resisted: Her bonds cut into her flesh. - Weapon? - Serrated blade. I'd say a commando knife, like the first two. And below, was it like the two others? It was different this time. I think he used something alive. - Alive? - A rodent, probably a rat. The external genitals were chewed up to the womb. And this? Her foot bones were mangled. He went at them with an iron bar, or a baseball bat. - The falaka. - What? The falaka. A Turkish torture technique. The face? Clearly, it's his obsession. Nose sliced off, lips cut out. And on all three, the same cuts: Like chevrons. The facial mutilations were all done post-mortem. Most killers have a ritual. But he's different: No trace of sexual contact. He washes his victims carefully, even cleans under their fingernails. A real scientist, obsessed with evil, but who never freaks out. The term "orderly killer" used in criminology manuals applies here. - Is that all? - It's quite a bit! Thanks. Captain Nerteaux! Your report! Want to wreck your career? - The brass know about Schiffer? - That's my problem. Heard of Gazil Hamet's murder? Schiffer was cleared. I did the autopsy. The Turk's face was as battered as this one. I read your report. You had nothing on Schiffer. No one ever does. Your partner's the Devil. What do you think? That the killer has a car and dumps the bodies from it. Why the facial wounds? Three possibilities. First, the killer's trying to mislead us. The second? Shrinks say the killer disfigures faces when he knows them. He can't bear them watching. I don't buy the "psycho" stuff. Third possibility? He's an artist. The cuts are like cracks in ancient statues. The killer's carving the same face. Even dumber! So what do you think? - The Iskele. - The what? Iskele means "pier." It's the Mafia network that handles illegals in Paris. They're highly organized. Everything's recorded, names, origins, workplace, what every illegal owes them. That'll help us identify the victims? Yes. If these girls are illegals, their bosses went to the Iskele to replace them. These murders mean lost money. And you know these guys? I know the boss, Malek. Malek Djessur. He's known as Marius. I saw his son being born. There you go. Dr. Mathilde Urano - Psychiatrist Mathilde Urano. Anna Heymes. Come. Terrifying, no? Yes, I feel like I'm inside it. How did you get my name and number? The phone book. It seems your amnesia only applies to faces. Especially my husband's. What does Prof. Ackerman think? He hasn't located any lesion. He wants to do a biopsy. Study my nerve cells. Did he say that a shock can also cause amnesia? A shock? No. If I'd had a severe shock, I'd remember it. Maybe not. Amnesia can erase its own cause. Why would it only concern my husband? Is your sex life with your husband normal? What do you call "normal"? Bland. Boring. The opposite. That department's fine. - How long have you been married? - 8 years. - Children? - No, that's just it. He claims I said I didn't want any. I don't remember that. I couldn't have said that! Sometimes, I wonder if it's not my husband who changed. Changed? How? Even when I'm fine, his face somehow seems different. As if his features were deeply changed. Cigarette? Thanks. You think I'm insane? Quite the opposite. You seek a logical explanation, you cling to reason. What if he's got a whole new face? - It can be done, right? - Technically, yes. Would he do it without telling you? Plastic Surgery Nowadays, it leaves no scars. So it's not such a crazy idea. When could he have done it? You just said I'd had a shock. Maybe then? Can you put off the biopsy? A few weeks, maybe. Will you come here several times a week? Yes. We'll try to see if your husband's part of that shock. Excuse me, miss. What's going on? You were watching me? During the night? Why? I don't know. Did they change you? Change me? Change what? Your face. You've gone crazy. You'll feel better. I'll call Eric. Tomorrow I'll take you to the Institute. You need help. It can't go on like this. You need that biopsy. You've gone crazy! I'll show you shapes. Describe them. It was Laurent... your husband. Anna, hurry! It's 8 AM! Coming! Why did you lock the door? Open the door! I'll break down the door! You're crazy! You'll fall! What are you doing? Come back! Come back! Call a patrol, she's running away! Hurry, dammit! We've got to catch her! She's up there! Come with me. The others go round! Hurry, she'll escape through the building! Grab her! Shit! Call Charlier. We need back-up. Unless we find her, it's big trouble. You hear? Public Assistance - Paris Hospital Miss? I have the results of your tests. You didn't mention your accident. It affects my diagnosis. What happened? Was it a car crash? Miss? Never investigate on an empty stomach. That stuff's too greasy. You can't understand these guys unless you eat their food. That's the price. I was a narc 4 years. I didn't shoot up! To fight evil, you gotta taste it. What's that? An introductory gift. These guys like tokens of friendship. You hate Turks, don't you? Not at all, I almost married an Anatolian. Is Marius in? I got a present for his boy, Ali. It's from the Shaft. Salam aleikum, brother! Aleikum salam, Marius. I've missed you, brother. Really. How long has it been? Guys our age shouldn't count! Captain Paul Nerteaux. My superior officer. A little something... for my dear Ali. Schiffer, you didn't drag your ass here to give me a present for my son. 3 women you smuggled in were found dead. Tortured, disfigured. Friend, what are you talking about? Their files! Schiffer... you don't make the rules like in the old days. You're not the Shaft now. Marius, give us their files, and we're gone. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't do that. I destroyed them. No traces, no troubles. Watch the door! Watch the door, I said! Don't move! Hands up! Turn around! The files, or you're dead! Face the wall! Get down! The files! Turn around, get down! The files, Marius! - I swear I don't have them! - Schiffer. Stop it! The files! Nobody move! In the closet! Don't move! Behind you! A doctor... Have mercy... A doctor... A doctor... have mercy... Where do you think you are? Those are fascist methods! We're the law! You heard of the law? I know only one law. Mine. Screw you! Those methods are against my principles! Marius is a scumbag! He controls his girls by mutilating their kids back home. Look! Godammit! Look! They're all alike... They're almost identical! You were right. Your killer is obsessed by the same face. How did he find such lookalikes? With these I can question their bosses. They won't tell you anything. The neighborhood's protecting the killer. Why? They're scared to death, kid. You'll have to rip out the truth, the way I ripped out those files. You need me, kid. You never needed me more. Stop calling me "kid". It bugs me. Who is it? Anna. What's going on? I'm not crazy. They erased my memory. They erased my face. What are you talking about? Laurent, my husband. Him and all his cop pals. Come inside. Come... Think. We have to find her. And fast. You! You must know something about her that could help, Prof. Ackerman. I don't have much to work with. We chose her because we could erase her personality without much resistance. Find her. You have 24 hours. Or else... I'm cleaning house. Anna! Did you tell anyone of your visit here? No one! Mathilde... What's going on? What did they do to me? I called a biologist friend. Ackerman's institute does memory research for the army. What kind of research? Secret research. Why did they do it? Why did my husband...? Laurent? He may not be my husband? Anything's possible. But why me? We have to find out who you really are. How? I remember nothing. - One thing can remember for you. - What? Your body. He's an old friend. I said you had a bad car crash. You lost your face, ID, memory. So we don't know who you are. Got it? Mathilde... Why are you doing this for me? Sheer scientific interest. A blood test will tell us who I am? The body remembers outside contacts. It's like vaccines: Exposure to a virus makes you produce antibodies for years. It works for a disease, and for the rest. Here... The toilets are over there. You're wasting your time. You pull any shit. You'll whack me? Sure... So laugh... Don't worry, change of technique. I'll be finesse itself. Behave, we're meeting a fine lady. Ruya Berkes used to work here. What can you tell me? The girls don't dare go out. Redheads dye their hair, the area's cursed. What do you think? Azra?l is here, stealing our girls. Who? The angel of death. His faithful are all over. Your dumb beliefs always amused me. Don't waste my time! Now what? What are we looking for? The killer has someone working for him. To round them up. Basement 34, right? Sir? Police! Stop! No, Schiffer! - Who do you work for? - Lay off! Gurdilek protects me. Cut it out! Screw Gurdilek! Why'd you round up that girl? - Who do you work for? - Bozkurt! Bozkurt! - No, let go of him. - Don't be dumb, kid! Never call me kid again! Shut up! Shut up! Stop! You heard what that guy said: The Gray Wolves. Bozkurt! A far right Turkish group. There's no serial killer! Stop it, you're way off. We must find a woman, not a killer. What woman? What woman? - What woman? - The one the Gray Wolves want. They've messed up 3 times: They'll do it again! We need the prey, not the hunter. Look! Their sign! A wolf's head. I'm sorry. I found nothing. You live near a nuclear power plant? No, why? You have a high level of radioactivity. And the red blood cells of a top athlete. Is that all? You've endured extreme violence. Well beyond human tolerance. Look! I hadn't noticed that spot on your nail. Nicotine, maybe... You noticed I smoke? Yes, too much. But that's not nicotine. It's henna. My catalog of substances says... this stain is a specific vegetable compound. A rare henna, grown in northern Anatolia. It also explains the silicium level in your pulmonary glands. In a previous life, you were Turkish. Schiffer! You two hitting it off? Fine. He tried to waste me. Coffee? You're worse than I was at your age. You'll come to a sticky end. The funeral of one of their leaders. Is that their sign? They're right wing fanatics. They believe gray wolves saved the Turkish people, centuries ago. Ismail Kudseyi, the most dangerous mafioso in Istanbul. He's into nationalism, corruption, drugs. They say he kidnaps orphans in the countryside to indoctrinate them. Turns them into killing machines. They're sickos. Why do they want that girl? No idea. Disappointed? You preferred your serial killer? The problem's the same. We gotta find her before they do. Why take risks for an illegal you don't know? It's my job. A beautiful woman. She your mother? She was your mother. How do you know that? It's my job. That why you became a cop? It's not my first serial killer. I lost my mother when I was 7. I became a cop to find her killer. There... I reopened the file. I learned to live with a ghost. Now it's too late, I won't find him. But for her it's not too late. Gonna nap here? Or come see Gurdilek? You know Gurdilek? No, but that guy named him. You must know where he hangs out. But finesse, remember? Finesse itself. Gurdilek came to France when he was 15, hidden in the hold of a tanker-truck. Sadly for him, it was carrying acid, and the tank leaked. The other illegals died. Gurdilek was alive, but his throat and lungs were burned out. He breathes mentholated vapors all day. It gave him the drive to become top dog. Salam aleikum, Talat. Sorry to disturb you during your ablutions. The Shaft! You're back from the dead? More like the dead brought me back. Come closer... With Captain Nerteaux. When will you stop the massacre? We're in France. It's your job to protect us. Cut the crap. You know the Wolves are here. Why? Who are they looking for? I run this neighborhood, not my country. Don't disrespect me. Who's the girl they want? This business is rooted in the old country. How do they pick the girls? They have a picture. It can't be very good: They've been wrong 3 times! Don't play with me. Your friend here knows everything. Everything about what? When the Wolves took the first girl, 3 months ago, there was a big fuss. The cops came. They took another girl away. The Wolves injured her when she tried to... It's the Wolves! The cops silenced a witness. What's going on? Run! Think later! The girl the cops took in saw something. I told you, this thing's none of our business. If that's your attitude... I'll go check out that booking. Alone! - What's all this? - Shootout in the Turkish baths. Really? I remember you. You came before. About the seamstress murders. Good memory. Now I'm here about... A raid in a Turkish sweatshop, 3 months ago? That's asking too much, Captain. Can I see the log book? Thanks. Turkish illegal arrested. Cover-up attempt. Think you'll nab him? - Who? - Your serial killer! Know what? Tell me who was on duty, and we'll toast his arrest together. Thursday. - It was Lt. Beauvanier. - Can I talk to him? He was transferred to Nice. Is she the girl you want? Sorry? I was here when Beauvanier brought her in. What did she look like? Brunette, skinny, shaking. I got her a blanket. Did she say anything? - She was babbling... - In Turkish? No, in French. She talked about moons, wolves... And a night... with 4 moons. I remember that. - What did Beauvanier do with her? - Nothing. Other officers came for her next morning. - From lmmigration? - No. Anti-terrorism cops. Lighten the eyes. The nose thinner. Go up a bit. Down a bit. That's about it. Professor Ackerman? Please hold for the Chief Inspector. Charlier? A driver will bring you here. Why? The 24 hours aren't up! Laurent'll find her. Shit! Anna? Laurent's looking all over for you. Anna Heymes is dead. Or never existed. What are you talking about? Someone here wants to tell the media about your experiments. Mathilde Urano. I'm a psychiatrist. Let's not stay here. I made a discovery about the radioactive tracer used in a PETscan. Oxygen-15? At high doses, it can influence your memory. You confuse what you're told with real life. You injected her with memories? Which replaced her personality. What for? - It was Charlier's idea. - Who? Philippe Charlier. A top cop in Anti-terrorism. He'd heard of my work. After 9l11, he started a secret program to infiltrate terrorists: You kidnap one, and turn him into an informer. Am I a terrorist? No, you were just a test, an experiment. We used you to see how far we could go. So... it was all lies? Yes, from your husband to the janitor. You were living in a laboratory. Even the dinners with the cops were a test. Everything was filmed, recorded. For a month, it worked fine. Until your memory lapses started. Then I realized we'd screwed up. What were you going to do with me... later? Wasn't my problem. Who am I? A Turkish illegal. No family, no ID papers. In shock. Ideal for the program. Why did you change my face? We didn't! You came that way. - You're lying! - No, I swear. I saw you'd had surgery. But I didn't speak up. Why? You were my big chance. After years of research. I might never get another one. Now, go away. They'll find you through me. I want what you stole! - What? - My memory! Go to the clinic? Charlier's on a rampage! The operation's illegal, he may kill us. I have no choice! Neither do you! Hurry! Climb up. At first, it won't be pleasant. Your conscious mind will get jumbled. It'll confuse reality with what was installed. But slowly your real memory will take over. If there's anything left of it. Elipsis. Belix. Annafora. I always thought of you... as my daughter. - Who's that? - Our witness. Know what? Cops from Anti-terrorism took her away. She's who the Gray Wolves want. Masked men stormed into her sweatshop. She intervened. Why? She knew they'd missed their target! But they'd have recognized her. She may have changed her face. I'll identify her! Shady plastic surgeons aren't a dime a dozen. How does an illegal pay for a new face? I don't know who she is, but she's more than an illegal. Talks in French about wolves, a 4-moon night. This case was never yours, Nerteaux. - Why do you say that? - Because I like you. Small-time cops playing hero, I've buried many in my career. What are you saying? Take my advice: Forget this whole thing. We're so close now, and you dump me? I trusted you. Never trust anyone. I thought you obeyed only one law, your own. I also only have one skin. Drop this. How do you feel? I preferred being Anna Heymes. She's out of the scanner room. Hurry! Nobody move! We're done for. Hi, Anna. It's all over, darling. We're going home. Stop that! You'll kill him! The keys! What? You lost the girl again? Problems, Charlier? I'll call you back. What are you doing here? Not happy to see me? No, and I've got work to do. November 6th, you arrested a Turkish illegal. Why do you care about her? The Gray Wolves are in Paris. They've killed 3 women looking for her. Why are they after her? Who is she? - No one. Just an illegal. - Why? Why'd you make her disappear? She was perfect for our project. What project? Mental conditioning to infiltrate terrorists. To beat the CIA, I needed a guinea pig. You idiots! Erasing that memory! We turned a Turkish seamstress into a chic Parisian wife! Damn your experiment! Where is she? - She got away. - You're kidding? Would I? Her new personality was cracking. Now she may get her memory back. Then she'll act like the Turk she once was. You need a cop who knows that world. - You? - To rid us of her. Why? That's my problem. But it would solve yours, too. - Her clothes? - Clothes? That she wore when you busted her. In the archives. Tell them I'm on my way. You're back... Who are you? My name is Sema Gokalp. I smuggled heroin for the Golden Crescent. I had 20 kilos of pure heroin to hand to new contact here. Did you have your face changed? Why? I betrayed them. I wanted money for a new life: I stole the 20 kilos. They put a price on my head. How did you become a seamstress? I needed papers, I contacted the Iskele, the network that handles illegals, and I blended in with them. And the cops? How did they get you? I don't remember that part. But I know who the man in the candy store was. I told you of him. The one you'd seen? His name is Azer Zeki. He's an assassin. The cruelest killer you could imagine. He's been assigned to killing me. Who is it? Dr. Frederick Gruss? Police. Open up. You guys only work at night? How can I recognize her from that? It's your own work, Doctor. My work... This could be her. What was she like before? What was her name? Where is she? It's all I'm packing! That fucker! It's Nerteaux. Where are you? Get me the position of Schiffer's cell phone! OK. Give me 15 minutes, I'll call you back. - What'll you do? - Recover my package. And disappear. Just like that? Disappearing is my best way of thanking you. Goodbye, Mathilde. You won't manage alone! Why did you say you preferred being Anna? Leave! A lot of people had to die for us to meet. Sema... Take the dope and put it on the floor, slowly. Why did you double-cross us? Schiffer! I know it's you! Stop! GSM report: Calls made by J-L. Schiffer Communications. Nerteaux here. Locate this number: 0942113457. It's ours. Narcotics division. Names are confidential. Thanks. NARCOTICS DIVISION ...Det. Schiffer was assigned with... Chief Det. Olivier Amien. Sir? It's personal. I have orders. - I'm sorry, but... - Amien! Stop, Jean-Pierre! - Have we met? - You know Schiffer? - What do you want? - To know who he was. You should know. He used to call you every night. Why did he try to kill her? Schiffer's dead! And you're off the case. Stay on your turf! You've made enough of a mess already. Jean-Pierre, come along. Damn them! We're on our way. What did you do in that cemetery? The Drug squad sent them. The DA has impounded your files.

Why did you come here? To understand. Come with me. Tie him up. Sema? We're through pretending. You came because you're like us. You're a Wolf. She's mine. Why is he here? Kudseyi asked me to recover the dope. I brought her back without bloodshed. What have you brought us? Your friend. I saw you fall 15 meters! I told you to drop it, kid. What's that? Her new face. You're hearing the metal under her skin. You'll pay for betraying, Sema. He'll decide. Should he forgive you for stealing drugs? We were farmhands. You owe him everything. Education, power, ideals. At what price? You were the best of us. Why did you do it? - Where are you taking her? - To see Ismail Kudseyi. You're one of them. You sure fooled me. You asked for it. Thank you, Schiffer. It's been so long... The way you changed is spectacular. You see that rug? It shows our warriors. The hands of women wove that rug. Loyal women. What do you hope from me, you who betrayed me? I thought of you as my daughter. I beg your forgiveness. I chose you from hundreds of children. I gave you everything. You had me sterilized. To make a fighter of you, a warrior! No child deserves what I went through. Then you're not my child now. - What is this? - She and I have a deal! Backup's coming! Let's go. Commander, tell your men to be careful. Schiffer's inside. He's dead. He's not who I want. This is where the Gods led me. The others were just sketches. You'll be my finest statue. You'll be eternal... Azer, stop. It's over, Kudseyi's dead. She's breathing. You're right. For her, it wasn't too late. Schiffer? Amien here. Yes, Amien. What's happening up there? It's over.
