Hey there, little guy. Well, aren't you sweet? Let's get you a little breakfast. One, two, three... The stars aligned! Oh, sorry. I know what you said about sudden entrances, but I couldn't wait, and the door was open. Boy have I got a surprise for you. No, no! No more blind dates, please. No, way better. Okay, that's a very low bar. The last one tried to sell me a timeshare. Well, yeah, but he offered you the employee package. That's chivalry. Here, come here. Come on. What? No. Cindy! Stop! Please stop. Stop. I don't want to meet anyone. Seriously. I'm happy, okay? Really. I love my shop and my flowers and my life just the way it is. I know, but that's why you're going to love who I'm about to introduce you to. It's gonna be great publicity for the shop. Bolivia is here! The country? No! The hottest do-it-yourself crafty couple. Don't you watch the morning news? I'm here with Boris and Olivia, better known as "Bolivia," to get some tips for a romantic rainy day. What do we have here? This... Is the Rom-cho! The perfect poncho for the couple that loves to snuggle together. Hand-sewn by yours truly. Designed by me. Beautiful. Now do you recognize them? Actually, yeah. I just read a headline. They're getting married, right? Exactly! They're local celebrities. So if you took them on, it would be amazing for the shop, and local news exposure would be a huge boost for Cuffed by Cindy. You know how many wedding planners are in this town. Just come say hi. They're waiting upstairs in the shop, and they're so excited to meet you. Okay, you know what? You're right, you're right. It would be really great for the shop. Plus, I'd be doing Grandma proud. Plus, um... you're kind of my best friend, and I am always happy to help you. So yes, of course. I'm in. Yay! Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Just one question. How difficult are they? Hi there! Welcome to Romance in Bloom. You must be Boris and Olivia. It is so nice to meet you both. Cindy has told us so much about you. Your shop is so chic! It is a little cold though. Well, flower shops have to be kept cool to keep the flowers from wilting. That, and my AC belongs in the '70s. Why don't we step over here to have a chat? So, when it comes to designing the theme of the wedding flowers, I like to get to the heart of a couple. So, I'm gonna ask you to a few questions... I'm kind of our designer. We both design. Although, I'm the one that usually executes. Only the softer textiles. I'd like to see you turn a lathe or whittle something. You know what? Here at Romance in Bloom, we actually pride ourselves on creating original, in-house designs that help reflect and amplify a couple's love story. We actually already have a number of sketches. You know what? And I'm sure those are wonderful. Can't wait to look at them. But if we could just hold on for one moment. I'm still getting to know you two. So... how did you two meet? Oh goodness! That was so many crafts ago! Well, where was it? Was it a park? Yes. And you were wearing your cable knit sweater. And you had that exquisite artisanal bird feeder. To our new clients. To us. Oh, this is very good! I got this from the last wedding I planned. Wasn't that the one with the fire? The fire was in March. This one was the one that flooded. That's why Boris and Olivia's wedding has to go perfectly. Well, I am so excited to dive in. I mean, helping people design their dream weddings is the best feeling in the world. And you know, their guest list is gonna be a regular who's who. Maybe you can find a handsome hunk! I am very happy by myself. Is that so wrong? I'm just saying, no matter how many times you kiss your roses, they can't kiss you back. Hey, John, how you doing? Hey there, Violet! Hey, how's the shop? Oh, it's fantastic! - All right! - How are you doing? I'm all right. Those daffodils were a big hit. Good morning, Steven. Good morning, Jill. Good morning. Beautiful! Hey, Norman. It's a really big order today. Can I get three bushels of the lilies, two of the dark roses, and as much baby's breath as... You're not Norman. No, I'm Norman's grandson, Jack. Wait! I remember you. You were here one summer when we were little, right? Little miss bookworm. Oh, wow. Yeah, I... forgot all about that silly little nickname. Well, in my defense, you were always reading books. If I remember correctly, you were always stealing my books. What was that super original nickname you gave me? It was accurate, and it was book thief. Oh. Well, I promise you my book stealing days are... They're in the past. Yeah, sure. Wait. What are you doing here anyway? Oh, I'm just helping out with the stand till Gramps gets to feeling better. Oh no. Is Norman okay? I just saw him last week. He was fine. He's fine. He rolled his ankle setting up the stand. He's kinda being a big baby about it. Thank goodness. I mean, not thank goodness that he rolled his ankle, 'cause that would be terrible. That's not what I meant. I just mean thank goodness that it wasn't... I know. I know what you meant. Yeah. I love your grandfather. You know, my grandmother told me that Norman was actually the first vendor she ever bought flowers from for her own shop. Romance in Bloom, right? Yeah. Yeah. I remember it. So what brings you in today? Oh. Um... This. Oh wow. Oh wow! How many events do you have going off right now? Just one. Is it a flower show? It's a wedding. Ah. See, that makes sense. What we have here... is the work of a mega-bridezilla. You know what? I really resent that stereotype. Men can be just as demanding as women. Fair enough. But is it a groomzilla? Honestly... it's more like a couplezilla. Ooh, that's rare. And super fun. Okay. Well, I need to get started on this, like, yesterday. Here. This one's on the house. Thank you. - I'll see you around. - Sure. - Yeah. - Okay. Well, if it isn't Miss Violet. - Hi, Norman. - Hey! How you doing? I heard about your ankle, and I thought I'd stop by. Hydrangeas! - Marge's favorite. - Marge's favorite. Why, don't you have the memory on you? - Come on in. - Thank you. Sure. How you doing? Doing great now that I see you. Well, here you go. One sugar and a dash of full cream, just like your grandma liked it. - Thank you so much, Norman. - Sure. Well, I see you've been doing some redecorating. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Wow, that sunflower is really amazing. Wait a sec. Is that a southern monkey flower? Beats me. My grandson Jack took 'em. Yeah! I just saw him at the market. He's a good kid. He's good to have around. Wow. I mean, who would've thought the book thief would become a photographer? That's right! He's a nature photographer. Really? Yeah. Well, at least he used to be anyway. He really loved shooting the endangered ones. Yeah. I mean, he's pretty good at it. Gramps, you are not gonna believe the size of this order. It is a whopper. Yeah, I can't wait to get back to work. Hanging around here, I'm just, I'm losing it. Let me get that. No, no. I got it, I got. - Sit down, sit down. -Come on! - Give me something to de here! - Okay, okay. I guess it could start prepping that order. It's a big one, and I do have dinner with Angelica later. She still pressuring you to join her father's firm? It's not pressure, Gramps. It's... It's inspiring. She's inspiring me to put my law degree to use. Well, just be careful you don't inspire yourself into a big old mess. I get what you're doing, and I appreciate it. I do. But Angelica is not like that. She's... She really does have a good heart. She does pro bono work, she volunteers, she's... She's passionate and genuine. You don't have to convince me. I'm not the one going to work for her father. You are. I've spent the last five years of my life traveling the world, and it's been amazing, it really has, but I'll always have photography. I just... I don't know. I think I'm just tired of living out of a suitcase, you know? I think I'm ready to settle down. Fair enough. But just don't confuse settling down with settling. Hello. Well, if it isn't my favorite photographer. Betsy. I thought we discussed that I... Your little "Eat, Pray, Love" stint away from photography? Uh-huh. I'll bet my Botox you're back in a month. Natural Geographic is salivating to hire you. They saw the photos from Jakarta and want to send you back. Tell them I'm flattered, but, really, I'm done. You're literally killing me. Okay. But just know that you're missed. Oh my goodness! Look at you! Hey, babe. Jack, we have to be at a charity dinner in half an hour! That's fine. I'll be ready in five. Ew! You need to get out of the fertilizer and into the shower. ♪ Lavender blue a dilly dilly ♪ ♪ Lavender green ♪ If I were king a dilly dilly ♪ I'll need a queen Wow. I can't quit my day job. You could think about it. Well, thanks for knocking. Oh, I knocked. I rang the doorbell, called, texted, sent a couple emails. Eventually, I just had to come around back. Sorry, I... I sometimes get a little carried away serenading my plants. That's okay. I sing to my plants too. It helps them bloom faster. Yeah. Oh wow. Oh wow. I photographed that in the Maldives. Is that a ghost orchid? Yeah. No, but just don't disturb anything. Fair enough. It's like I'm back in the jungle again. Except you're actually not. You're in my very carefully curated gardens, so just... All right. Okay. I shot that in the Amazon. It's on the verge of extinction now. Yeah, I know. I mean, hence this whole setup. I'm trying to preserve as many species as possible. I mean, just so many are being destroyed by pollution and tourists. There are some flowers that are so magical, they only bloom every 3,000 years. The Youtan. You know about that? It's the stuff of legends. Only mentioned in ancient Buddhist scriptures. Blooms once every 3,000 years. That might be the only flower that I've not photographed. You know, I used to read this great blog. "Hunt for the Youtan". Yeah! That's the one. I was obsessed. Then they stopped posting. That's my blog. No, it's not. No, really! I'm the author. What? That's amazing! Tell me everything. I need to know everything. Yeah, sure. I mean, I have like seven years worth of research, so... Fantastic! We... I need to get back to work, but can we get together later and discuss the Youtan, just from one flower fan to another? Yeah, of course. I'll just warn you. It is a lot of information. So. Good. - Great. - Great. Good. Good and great. Good, good, and great. - Okay. - Okay. I'll put these upstairs. After work. - Don't forget. - I'll see you then. - All right. - Okay. One day. Okay. And... done. Perfect! They're gonna love it. It looks like it's for a funeral. True. But that's what they wanted. - Yeah. - And... send. Hello? So, the flowers are a wee bit small. Yes, well, they're small because they're just an example of what your flowers would actually look like. Hold on one second. You're on with Cindy, your wedding planner. Hi. We've been thinking about it. Uh-huh. And Olivia has new sketches. Oh, I see. We'd like you to take a look. Thanks! Okay. Boris wants to nix the sketches they provided. Ugh, that is such a relief! Because Olivia has provided new sketches. You're kidding. - I'm sorry. - Ugh! Well, at least with this client, I'll be able to afford a new AC unit. Well, hold on to that good feeling, because next week they'll probably want to come in and just arrange it themselves. Don't say things like that to me! What'd I miss? Oh! Why is it so cold in here? I uh... I really lost track of time. You guys have fun. - Yeah. - Thank you for letting me use the shop this afternoon. Yes. Always. So, just turn the AC to 11, and I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Where is the big flower mobile? Back at the farm. I like to use this when I'm in the city. You know what's super underrated? Walking. You've not ridden before? Does a bicycle count? Not at all. Then no. Well, hop on. I'll be careful. Just trust me. Trust you? The book thief? Listen, I got a confession to make. I've never actually stolen a book before. So you say. Ready? No. This is gonna be fun. Okay. So what's a botanist doing running a flower shop? I grew up in the shop. And then when my grandmother passed, it just... I don't know, research kinda took a backseat. I remember your grandma. She was sweet. Yeah. She used to sneak me candies when Gramps wasn't looking. She gave you candy? - Yeah. - No, stop it! I was never allowed to eat anything sweet! Not once. Didn't you keep gum stuck in your braces, like all the time? Your memory is irritatingly accurate. I miss her so much. I was sorry to hear about her passing. Yeah. She pushed me towards my dreams, you know? And that, that was botany. Just examining a plant's structure, it's genetic, it's ecology, just... everything. That's why I have the garden now, so I can still feel like scientist, I guess. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You still are very much so scientist, okay? I, for one, miss your blog posts. Yeah. I kinda just... stopped. Why? Okay. Is this an interrogation? Listen, flower hunk, I'm... That is a nickname that my best friend calls you, and I... I definitely do not use that. That would be so embarrassing if I said that to you. That would be mortifying actually. Well, I like it a lot better than "book thief." Well, hey, your story is not written in stone, okay? You can always go back into science and research and... blogging. Look at me. I'm getting back into law. Back? I'm so sorry. You didn't strike me as a lawyer. Yeah, I get that a lot. But my girlfriend's a lawyer too, and she has this dream where we both make partner at the same firm, so... That's nice when two people share a dream. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Um, sorry. Hello? I know you're out with flower hunk right now, but we are having a cake emergency! Plus, they want a new flower design. Oh, okay. No, no. I'll be right there, I'll be right there. I am so sorry. I have to go. I'm just gonna call a rideshare. Chicken. I get it. Well, apparently there will be a whole new order of flowers for you tomorrow, so... Sounds fun. Yeah. Hey, why don't you just stop by the greenhouse tomorrow? You can pick from the entire range of what we got, and I know Norm would love to see you again. Okay, sure. Okay. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. Bye. Blueberry and lemon. Try the red velvet. Gary. Hey Gary. They've been here four hours. I forget. Is this one gluten-free? For the fifth time, no. Okay. Gary, not the cake again. Please, please. Ohm great, the florist is here. Oh! Did you bring the new sketches? I didn't know I was supposed to. Well, we can't possibly pick a cake without coordinating with the overall floral design aesthetic. Of course you can! Shh! Would Martha Stewart forget to harmonize the cake with the flowers? Now imagine Martha Stewart is marrying Martha Stewart. You know what? Let's not focus on the wedding planning. Let us talk about the day you two met. I think you said it was in a park, right? Mm-hm. Okay, I want you guys to do me a little favor. Please, just close your eyes. I want you to think about that day you met. Great. Now tell me what you see. It was a crisp autumn day. Do you remember any colors? Oh, well, the leaves were changing. Everything was copper and scarlet. Boris is allergic to leaf mold though, so he must have had a runny nose. Let's... Eyes closed. Let's just focus on the environment, okay? Was it cold? Oh, well, there was a chill in the air. But my vintage Inishmore cable knit could handle it, no problem. Unscoured wool Cool. A good day for a hot drink, maybe? Yes, now that you mention it. I was drinking a pumpkin chai spice tea latte, with almond milk, of course. Of course. Okay, great. So... What if we did an autumn themed wedding, and Gary here made you a spiced chai cake with maple cream cheese frosting? Wow. You're good. Wait a sec. Our last set of floral designs, are a celebration of summer. We'll be back at square one! You know what? You guys have so much on your plate already. I feel pretty comfortable coming up with some designs. I mean... what if I took a shot at it? You're sure that you have a handle on our brand? Homemade chic. Luxury DIY. I promise it will be the most beautiful wedding ever. Mm-hm. Rise and shine. I'm working. Oh, what time is it? It's coffee time. Thank you. These are amazing. How do you have time to do all this and take care of your orchids? My plants! Sorry, sorry! Allow me. You need a... you need a break. I've been around these plants. I know what they need, okay? Just make sure that the succulents get a light sprinkling, approximately eight milliliters of water per plant, actually exactly, but just... Yeah. Okay. Okay. I mean, it's very important to be careful. - No, I agree. - Take your time with these, - because... - Mm-hm. Done. While it is not exact... I guess you did an adequate job. I remember the first time I saw one of these. It was in a Maori cave in New Zealand. And this little guy just about got me killed. It was in a Malaysian jungle. Giant leeches. Wouldn't recommend. I wish I had travel stories. Why don't you? You should see these flowers for yourself in the real world. I did have travel plans, but... Well, consider this garden tended. You ready to hit the farm? Yeah. Actually, can we grab a quick bite to eat? I'm very hungry. Get out of my brain. I present to you a traditional north African breakfast. Semolina pancakes with olive oil, a drizzle of honey, and goat cheese. Oh my goodness. This looks delicious. I've put on 10 pounds since he showed up. I'm sure. Well, I'm glad you guys are excited for this, because this is my absolute favorite recipe. I picked it up when I was in Morocco, shooting the dragon trees. Wow. That sounds like the best work. Yeah. Yeah, it was. Well, speaking of work, this old clunker's healing up, and I'm about ready to get back at it. Of course, that means I'm gonna lose a great helper. Gramps, I'm literally a phone call away. Do you know what kind of plants to have in law offices? Plastic. Just dig in. We've got flowers to pick. Wow. Yeah. I never get tired of seeing this. You might want to move your zinnias away from the irrigation system. Too much water spill can create water inflation or bloating. Well, first of all, I put them there for that exact reason, so that when I'm watering the top rack, the spill waters the ones on the bottom. I'm very careful about my spillage. Plus, we're not here to talk about my placement skills. We're here to help you pick out flowers for the minor celebrity wedding of the week? It is the local celebrity union of thecentury! Okay. But yes, yes, you're right. What was that? I'm what? - I was thinking... - What was that? That we should use orange chrysanthemums, because it's a workable hue, and it's an easy species to shape. Okay. Delphiniums are also really good for molding. Yes! And then maybe some monardas... hellebore if you have it, astilbe for sure, and roses for a pop. Look at you. You're just the perennial whiz kid. You see what I did there? Perennial? You get it? I got it. Great news! Guess who was granted an official interview with the law offices of Steinberg, Greenberg and Hakim! Oh. I'm sorry. And you are? No, I'm sorry. Violet, this is Angelica, my girlfriend. Angelica, this is violet with the Romance in Bloom flower shop. Pleasure to meet you. Hi. It's... I'm so sorry. Just... Romance in Bloom. Oh boy, what now? I'll be right there. Okay, hold on. I am so sorry. I have to go. I can show myself out. It was so nice to meet you. Cindy, honey, what happened? This happened. We're back with Boris and Olivia, everyone's favorite crafty couple with some tips for creating the perfect picnic. Well, we love dining outdoors. And what better way to dress up a picnic table than with creative cuisine and colorful dinnerware? That I designed. We'll talk about this later. No, I actually think that we should just talk about this right now. Guys, we're live. How is it that every time that you create something, it says "designed by Olivia", but any time that I create something, it says "made by us"? You take credit for everything! We are a partnership! Yeah, well, you know, this is just not working. Fine, Boris! You know what? Maybe the wedding isn't working either! This is too soft of a metal to throw! Take this back right now! When we come back, Rusty, the dog that climbed Mount Everest. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. My days as a celebrity wedding planner are over! And my days trying to be a wedding planner were just getting started! Oh, honey, this has nothing to do with you, okay? You are a great wedding planner. Hey, we will figure this out. I hope so. Angie's told me a lot about you. It's good to finally meet. We missed you at the holidays. Yeah... Sorry about that. Last-second trip to Bhutan. It was a whole thing. You're a character. I can see why she's sweet on you. Daddy! Relax, Pumpernickel. I'm just trying to get to know the guy. If he's dating my daughter and joining my law firm, then, yeah, me and him are going to be joined at the hip. Thick as thieves! Well, look, I'm just thankful for the opportunity. I know it's been a while since I last practiced, but... I think I'm ready to get back into it. All right, well, let's buckle up and get down to brass tacks. Now, why would you, Jack Walker, be an asset to our law firm? All right. Strong, silent type. I can respect that. But you gotta throw me a lasso here, all right? How about this little ditty? What makes you, um... pow, passionate about law? What makes me passionate? I guess I'd have to say the thrill of discovery. Really putting yourself out there, heck, throwing yourself out there into situations and jungles that not everyone would survive. Facing the unknown. Maybe you should come by the office for more formal interview. Of course. I'd be honored. I'm so sorry. Give me one minute. Betsy, I'm at dinner right now. Oh, that's nice. I'm working. Just tell Natural Geographic that it's... it's not them, it's me. Forget that dusty magazine. It's glossy white toilet paper for all I care. Listen, World Wilderness TV is interested in you shooting an exotic travel show. Not interested. Oh, come on! What's it gonna take to get you back behind the camera? I can't. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Artists. This is incredible. Let's just hope it works. Yeah. Oh boy. Oh, really? I'm here to break off the contract for our wedding that's no longer happening. Hey. I know I asked you both here to look over the contract, and that that's only partially true actually. I really wanted your opinion on this. Yes, it's lovely, but that is hardly the apex of our concerns right now. Boris. Not our designs, but... - Wow. - Wow. This is just a small example of what your wedding would have looked like. Compliments of a master baker. And what else were you imagining? Just for curiosity's sake. Well, if we were to move forward, I typically like to get to the heart of a couple, ask a few simple questions. It's actually a technique I learned from my grandparents. And they should know. I mean, they were together for over 50 years. Well, what sort of questions would you ask? Well, if we were doing this for real, I would start with something simple, you know? Name one thing you love about the other person, Just the first thing that comes to mind. Well... I love that... Olivia gives me the confidence to be the real me, to learn who I am. Yeah! That's a great answer. I... I love that Boris pushes me out of my comfort zone. I was a total wreck with stage fright before our first segment on Channel 55, and Boris just looked me in the eye... and said, "You can do this." "You will not ruin this for us." Yeah, no, well... Grandma did say you... you find yourself when you push yourself. Boris, I know things have been rocky lately, but I'm crazy about you. I'm still up for getting married if you are. I lied when I said that I returned the tux. I own it. It's in the closet and I try it on every night. Oh! Let's throw caution to the wind. You're right. It's all about the big day. And I can not wait to spend forever with you! Olivia, will you make me the happiest man alive this weekend? Yes. Yes! A thousand times yes! You can make that happen, can't you? Yeah. This thing is actually pretty warm. I swear I'm going to fix the AC one of these days. You were amazing today. Boris and Olivia and me are lucky to have you. Well, they are very lucky to have you. Well, speaking of people in our life being - lucky to have us... - No, don't. Don't start it. So... How's the flower hunk? Okay... He has a girlfriend. And even if he didn't have a girlfriend, Jack and I, we are just highly incompatible. I mean, he is a no airbags, no filter kind of thinker, or should I even say non-thinker? That sounds dreamy. Well, speaking of dreams, I guess he has awakened something in me. I found an old photo of me and my favorite professor! Dr. Rose? Yeah, I was thinking about reaching out to her, but I just feel like she had such high hopes for me, and... I think she'd love to hear from you. I doubt it. Why don't you just give her a call? Well, now you sound like Jack! Did I just hear my name? We were just recommending your photography. Yeah, we definitely were not talking about you in any other capacity. We were just working. Well, it is Michael Buble and bubble bath time for me. I'm out. Uh... I don't remember seeing any previously arranged flower meetings on the calendar. Right. See, I was kind of hoping that... I can take a look at your research... in person, with my own eyes. Yeah. I don't know. I have a lot of work to do around here. It's the closest I'm ever gonna get to the actual flower. Please? Okay, so the Youtan was last seen in this area, which the text references... Oh, hello! See, that's the little miss bookworm I remember. I don't know how that got mixed in there. What? What? Look at you! You're so cute here. Still are. Well, compliments will get you everywhere. Well, you were not lying. This is a ton of research. Yeah, well, I mean, I have some recordings of oral history, some copies of ancient texts, some actual ancient texts, and pretty much every book written on the subject. Ooh, um... Just be careful with that. That's Dr. Rose, right? The one that you were gonna go to China with? See? Told you I was a fan of your blog. Yeah. She and I haven't spoken since I didn't go, so. Why not? I just had this conversation. Look, she had really high hopes for me, and... I let her down. Ooh, this is work, and it's gonna take a while. That's fine. It's getting late. I gotta check on Norman. Talk to you later? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Hello? Hi, Violet. It's Olivia. Hi! Yeah, I was thinking about what you said about your grandparents and how your grandmother likes to get to the heart of the matter. So, I do have one more request. We love your scarlet theme, and my grandmother's favorite flower was red milkweed. So, I'd like to add that to my bouquet. Yeah, of course. Of course. Consider it done. That's lovely. Thank you. Okay, have a good night. So, can we add red milkweed to the order? See, I knew they were gonna come back with their own designs. Au contraire, my friend. She is having me create an elegant bouquet of red and gold, but she wants to include red milkweed, because apparently it is her grandmother's favorite flower. Violet, that is actually the one flower we don't have. Oh! But I do know where some grows out in the wild. Okay, fantastic! Great. Where? You might want to put on some hiking boots. Excuse me? Here? We're in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. You ready for this? No. You'll be fine. - You sure? - Uh-huh. Gotta go that way, gonna take a left, and then got a 70-foot climb. Ooh! This is better than Pilates. And way more rewarding. Jack, Jack! I got you! I got you. You're good. Thank you. You know, I'm not opposed to an adventure like this. Yes, I like to have things planned out ahead of time, do a little risk assessment, don't tend to jump head first into these sorts of things. And, truth be told, I'm... really not a big fan of heights. Oh. You might not like this next part. Can you elaborate? Uh, no. Absolutely not. No. Look, it's perfectly safe, okay? People cross this thing all the time, and no one's ever fallen through. That I know of. That is not helping! Just watch what I do. No. Come on, Violet. Come on, Violet. You can do this. You can do this. You're cool. You can do this. You can do this. I can't do it. I can't do it! - I can't do it! - Violet... Violet, you can do this, okay? Just close your eyes and go for it. Well, don't actually close your eyes! You've got to see where the missing boards are, but... go for it. Okay. Come on, Violet. Come on, Violet. Okay. Uh-uh. I don't like this, Jack. I don't like it. Almost there. You got it. Oh, it is a long way down. - You did it! - I did it! Uh... Well, what are we waiting for? After you. Yeah. Wow! Not bad, right? Are you kidding me? I mean, this place is... incredible. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Thank you so much for bringing me here. You got yourself here. How did you even find this place? So we came here on a school field trip once. I got lost, super lost. And I just... just kind of discovered it. I don't know. It just felt so different from the city. Anyway, came back here a couple days later with a little camera and took some pictures. Been a nature photographer ever since. Wow. It's amazing what you can find in your own backyard. Like... Red milkweed. You are my hero. Please. I'm proud of you for taking that leap today. Thank you. I'm proud of me too. Now, seriously, is there like a trolley or an alpaca to get down? Yeah, alpaca stand's just up that way. - Fantastic. - Mmhmm. Okay, let's be really careful. Try to keep the roots intact. You got it. I got you. Um... Well, I really do have a lot of work to do, but I could use some help from a fellow flower-person. I would love to, but I have this previously scheduled engagement. Sounds serious. Just the rest of my life. Okay, well, um... I'll see you around, or later, tomorrow maybe. Hi, my name's Jack. I'm here... And it's a flush! I'm not to be rude, but I'm running late for a meeting. Can you help me out? Have a seat. Okay. Do not fondle the plants. Ugh! There he is! Jack. Good to see, sir. Sorry I'm like. Traffic coming out of the country was crazy. Well, my grand pappy used to say the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. That is hilarious. That's a known fact. Won't happen again. I promise. Let's quit with the jaw flapping and get to the tour wagon, all right? Let me show you around. This is where our junior associates and admins spend their days and, quite frankly, some other nights! Right here, you can make copies, like that guy's doin'. That machine gets quite a workout, 'cause you gotta learn how to replace the ink, the cartridges, or whatever they put in there. But don't worry, we've got a closet full of that stuff right here. Right here, you've got your watering hole. We like to keep the herd fed and hydrated. We don't want anybody sick. A sick hour is not a billable hour. Remember that, Jack. Right here are some of the finest offices in the world! And here's mine. Looks great. You play your cards right, and pretty soon, boom! You'll have an office just like this. Well, not the corner office, of course. That's for the big boys. But you work the billable hours, sun, and, yeah, there's a window in your future. Um... Thank you. Yeah. And thank you for stopping by. Daddy, I... thought he was supposed to interview with the other partners. Don't worry about that, Jelly Bean. I have a sneaking suspicion they'll be just fine making you an offer. Jack speaking. Hey, Jack. It's me. I hope I'm not disturbing you. No, I was just... putting some things in storage. That's funny. I was just taking some things out of storage. Hey, I really... I really want to thank you for today, and... it's been really great getting back into my research. And I want you to know that... it's still my dream to find the Youtan. I'm happy for you, Violet. Hello! Earth to Jack! I've been calling you repeatedly. Sorry. I guess I left my phone in the shed. After today, you'll never have to be in a shed again. They drew up an offer! I wanted to deliver it myself, and yes, I peaked, and yes, it's really good. I can't take it. What? I'm sorry. Yesterday made me realize that, as much as I like being with you, it's just not the firm for me. I opened doors for you, Jack. I went out on a limb! This isn't just a job. This is my family you're turning your back on. I went back on anyone. Truly, I don't mean any disrespect, because I appreciate what you did for me. I do. I just have to be honest with myself. I wouldn't be happy there. You know what? I gotta go. I'm sorry, the number you've called is not in service. Please check the number and try again. Guess what. I was just about to call you. Really? Yeah. Oh. Well, I did some research last night, and 356 Pleasant View Drive in Springfield is where Dr. Rose lives. You called her. Sure did. I'm so proud of you. Thanks. Well, she's expecting us. Us? Yeah. Is that okay? Yeah. - Let's go! - Okay! Wow. Is she having a party? Sounds like it. Violet Markey! - Dr. Rose! - Oh! Oh my goodness! It's so lovely to see you! You too! I hope we're not interrupting anything. No, no, no! I'm just finishing my dance work out. Come in! Come in! Thank you for having us. Oh, Violet, I am just so happy to see you! Oh, wow. Oh! Merengue! It's the merengue! Come on, Jack. I am Rose, by the way. I'm Jack. I'm actually a big fan of yours. There we go. Oh, the grand finale. Oh my. Boom! Boom! Do you guys smell something? Oh, that's just my tiki tart air freshener. It sets the mood. No, something's definitely burning. Yeah. My brownies! Oh dear, oh dear! It looks like I'm not getting this retirement thing down. Yeah. Wow. So you're retired now? Oh, for six months now. I've just always loved this town, so I bought this cottage, and now my only vocation is to live my life like I'm on vacation. I think you did a pretty good job so far. Well, thank you. I am parched. Can I offer you a chilled libation? Yes. I would love an iced tea please. Oh, wait. Vocation, vacation, libation. Alliteration! And here you go. Thank you so much. This place is amazing. You've been everywhere. Yeah. That I have. Yeah, well, speaking of traveling... I am so sorry that I didn't go with you to China. And I backed out at the last minute, and I really never got to explain why, and it just... Violet, don't. I know what it meant for you to continue your grandmother's legacy after she passed. I never questioned the choice you made. Thank you. But... I never forgave myself for letting you down. Oh, don't be silly, darling. You didn't let me down. Truth be told, you didn't miss out on anything. I just kept running into dead ends. I would think the Youtan was in one area, and then, poof, nothing. But I did have a little rendezvous with a professor down there, and he gave me a souvenir. Okay. She's awesome. "Rendezvous"? Now, this map was given to Francois by a Shaolin monk, and the legend is that there's not just a single flower; there is an entire garden of Youtan. Whoa. But I think that my adventuring years are behind me. Violet, even though you didn't join me, you were always my star student, and you always will be. Thank you, Dr. Rose. Can I take this? Thank you, thank you, thank you. And if you're ever in the city, please come by the shop. I would love to. Can I meet you in the garage? Yeah. Your grandfather let me in. Can we talk? Yeah, of course. Listen, your happiness is important to me. I would hate myself if I felt like I... forced you down a path you didn't want to go. And I appreciate you being honest with me. But if I'm being honest... Well... you make me happy. But this relationship... doesn't. I know. I've been feeling the same way. You are an amazing woman, Angelica. You're smart and driven, and I don't want to hurt you. I wish that I could just magically become the man that you want me to be, but... that's not who I am. I know. Good luck, Jack. Hey. You okay? Yeah, I think so. Or... I will be. So, what are we looking at? Okay, there's gotta be connection here, a missing link, something, literally anything. All right, well, you hold that thought. I'm gonna go water the succulents. Water spill-off. Moisture, dirt, darkness. It's caves! It's do what now? Everywhere the Youtan grew was in the damp and dark, and everywhere it was spotted with near... Dark and damp something. Okay, so it was last seen in this shaded field and near this mountain base, But given how delicate the flower is, one gust of wind and it's... - Gone. - Exactly! And in order for the Youtan to survive, it would need a controlled, dark and damp environment like a cave! Like a cave. You are a genius. Look at this. Everything lines up with the scroll. See? That's a match. The Youtan has got to be there. Okay, I just want to cross- reference it with my notes. Yeah. Let's go. Okay. Do you need this one? - I don't think so. - Okay. Why is it so hot in here? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! It's all ruined! Everything! Jack, how did I let this happen? That's okay. We can fix this. How? The wedding is on Saturday! I'll help, okay? I can... Even if you help people, even if we got more flowers, I... I still have to get a new AC unit and install it. It's over. I ruined everything. I lost the biggest client my best friend has ever had. My grandmother would be so disappointed in me. I'm sorry, but... What if this is actually a good thing? How is this possibly a good thing? I don't mean this. I just mean in the big picture. What if this is a wake up call? I get it. You love this shop, and you're an incredibly talented florist, but that's not your passion. Violet, we can do it. We can go find the Youtan. What? I turned down the job offer. Angelica and I broke up. We can go. Are you kidding me right now? I can't just go to China! Okay? Jack, look what happened when I... I just dropped the ball for an afternoon! I have to stay here, and I have to fix this. Do you though? Yeah! But really, do you? Because for years, your dream has been to find the Youtan, And now you can. Don't turn your back on it for a second time. You know what, Jack? I'm so glad that you can live your life that way. I don't turn my back on my friends or my responsibilities. I am so sorry that I can't just change my life on a whim like you. There was a reason that my research needed to stay in that box. It was to remind me to focus on what is real. Not some stupid goose chase. So just, can you go? Please? Please, Jack, just go. I'm sorry. Nothing I said came out the way that I meant for it to. I'm sorry. Hello? The gods have answered in record time, and mama's goin' shoppin'. Sorry? I wrangled you a research permit so you can go look for your flower. Hello? Cancel it. It'd be wrong to search for the Youtan without its lead authority. Look, I don't know exactly what's going on with you, Jack, but finding this flower has been your dream for as long as I've known you. Believe me, I know. You're... You're so stupid. So stupid. You're such an idiot! Nobody is home! Nobody's home! Honey. It's okay. It's okay. And I've got the perfect medicine. Ugh! This is your fear talking. I told you, I really don't want to talk about it. No, no, no. This has nothing to do with Jack. Okay, well, maybe a little bit. But, you know, he brought your dreams to the surface, and that's a good thing. You have been hiding away for too long. If you don't just act on your dreams, just break out of your comfort zone and face your fear, you are gonna live a life of regret. What are you, a part-time counselor now? Honey, I am a wedding planner. Same thing. I swear, I will get to it someday, but for right now, what are we gonna do about Boris and Olivia? I will handle Bolivia, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Good night. - Good night. And Violet, don't let some day... become never. I don't have quite the skills in the kitchen you do. There it is. Thanks, Grandpa. I'm... I'm just not that hungry. Well, you got messed up written all over you. Yeah. I... I screwed up everything. Can't be that bad. Angelica and I broke up. Maybe that's for the best. Then I went and ruined everything with Violet. What happened? I was an idiot. I tried to push her out of her comfort zone too soon. "The greatest warriors are time and patience." Tolstoy. I think I just need to take some time, figure stuff out, you know? That's usually not a bad idea. You know... life changes are hard, Jack. Sometimes they can be scary. But we all make it through. Matter of fact, I think I might be making some changes of my own. I love you, Grandpa. I love you too, boy. You gonna be all right. How did I sleep so late? Surprise! Oh! Uh... Isn't it just a dream? Is it? Am I awake right now? Before you freak out, I spoke with Jack. You what? He did this. All of it! He even got the AC fixed. And when Cindy told us what happened... We came right over. I can't believe you found the red milkweed. And, if it's all right, we want to get married here! In your shop! Just us and a couple of our friends, and you and Cindy, of course. And Gary. Here? Here? You want to get married here? Well, it's here where we rekindled our romance. You can say where our romance bloomed again. So you aren't firing us? Of course not! Absolutely not! Oh, come on, everyone! Group hug! Wow, I... You guys, I really don't know what to say. I think if you have anything to say, you should probably say it to Jack first. He left you this. What? Oh, Jack. Violet, I won't bother you anymore or tell you what to do or try to fix things that aren't my business. I hope the flowers and AC help show how sorry I am. Jack. Oh my goodness. Honey... go get your man. Are you sure? There's so much work to do in here. In love and crafts, rule number one, don't wait for the glue to dry. Go! Okay! Okay! Set the AC to 10 and... I'm gonna go get my man! Call Jack Walker. Hey, you've reached Jack. Leave a message. Hey, how goes it this morning, Violet? It's going. Hey, Jack, it's Violet. Just... I really need to talk to you. Call me back, okay? I should've stretched before all of this. What in the... Oh, lordy. Violet? Hi, Norman! I literally just ran out of gas because I wasn't paying attention. I was at the market trying to find Jack and he wasn't there, so I thought maybe he'd be here. Why is... What's going on? Why is the flower stand all torn apart? I decided to say goodbye to the stand today. What? I'm throwing in the towel. And it's a good thing Jack had a place to take all of my flowers. I really can't think about puttin' around in that empty house, but I think my body's telling me it's time. Big life changes can be daunting. That they can. Hon, you know, sometimes you just gotta know when to call it quits. And when to go for it. I finally know that, and that is why I came here today. I'm trying to get ahold of Jack, but he's not answering his phone, and I gotta talk to him. Well, you know, the reception at his old thinking place isn't the greatest. Norman! Of course, of course! He's at his thinking place! I am, in fact, out of gas. Well, I'd offer you a can, but all mine are empty. But there is a solution. Take his Vespa. Oh! Oh, it's a piece of cake. Marge and I used to ride real motorcycles. This thing is just a glorified bicycle with an engine. It doesn't even have gears. You just on it and go, Go ahead. I choose the danger. Good luck, kid. Go get him. It's go time. Whoa! Come on, Violet. Come on, you got this. Nope! Just go. Okay. There's not a hole there. I'm totally fine. Okay. Finally! Violet? Norman said you were at your thinking spot, so I just, I figured- What are you doing here? Well... I've been trying to call you all day. Phone's been turned off and... honestly, I didn't think I'd hear from him. My grandmother told me that everyone's dreams are different, and her dream was the flower shop, and she poured her heart and her soul into it, and she loved it. I loved it, too, and she knew that was never gonna be me, and my life, and she was so proud of who and what I was becoming, but... when she died, I felt like I had to honor her legacy by staying here, but now I don't even think that's true, and I don't think that's what she would've wanted. Just... What I'm trying to say... is that I am so sorry for how I acted yesterday. Things were just moving so fast. Don't apologize, okay? That... That's on me. I did that guy thing where I just... I don't know, and I rushed in and tried to fix everything without stopping to think and listen. I was insensitive. No, you weren't. What you did for the shop? The flowers, the air conditioning? No one has ever done anything like that for me before. I was happy to do it. But I shouldn't have pushed you. No, I needed to be pushed. Cindy's right. I have to banish my fear. Fear is huge. Trust me, I know. I've been all over the place with what I want out of life lately, and what you said last night really hit home for me. Taking responsibility. Relationships. So, I've decided I am gonna start practicing law again. Not with Angelica's father, but there's a small firm in town that specializes in environmental conservation. That way I can keep an eye on Norm. I don't have to be on the road 12 months out of the year. I still get to do something I love. I have photographed every flower I've ever wanted. Except for one I'm just gonna have to leave that one to you, Violet. Sorry. It might be work. Or a text message from Cindy. Is everything okay? Yeah, just a lot of changes for the wedding. We have so much crap to do with the new venue. What can I do to help? I mean it. Well, I can always use some help from a fellow flower expert. Oh, so I'm an expert now? We'll see. Okay. Let's sort these from Scarlet to dark gold in three rows. Yes, ma'am. You know, this is actually really peaceful. Yeah. It is, isn't it? Hey, do you think that Norman would want to help? Are you kidding me? He would jump at the chance. - Yeah? - Yeah. Would you look at this! Gosh, this brings back so many memories. You remind me so much of your grandmother. Aw, thanks, Norman. Hey, how would you feel about looking after my shop here and there? Oh, I would love that. Really? 'Cause I couldn't leave my shop with just anyone, but I think you'd be perfect. Oh! Gramps, take it easy, man. What are you doing? Norman, your leg! My leg hasn't felt this good in years! So, are we just gonna stand here? Let's get working, huh? Okay, head on back. You plan on going somewhere? Dr. Rose! Well, I was in town, and I thought I would take you up on your offer to see the shop. Oh, thank you so much! We're actually getting ready for a wedding, and it's... I brought refreshments! And I brought snacks! Wow. I guess it's a party now. Nope. Keep coming this way. This way. Closer. What do you think about this? Ooh, let me see. Oh, put it down. Jack, this looks amazing. Thank you. Yes, yes, we can do that. Okay. No, I'm good. Thank you for today. For everything. I should be thanking you. What you did for Norman was... It was sweet. Well, I meant it. Ah, well... We've got a big day tomorrow. We? Am I invited to the wedding? Yeah. I mean, it's gonna be all hands on deck, so we need to make sure it runs smoothly. Okay. I'll be there. Great. Okay. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. Here's to taking chances. Rise and shine! Did I start all you? I need my spare key back. But then I couldn't pop in on you. And then... I couldn't show you this. Ooh. Compliments of the bride and groom. It's beautiful! Now. Thank you all for being here today. And yes, I am an ordained minister. We're gathered here today to celebrate the union of Boris and Olivia, known to the world as Bolivia, but no one to each other as soulmates. They've each written their own vows. So, without further ado, Boris, take it away. Olivia... Every year since I met you has been the happiest year of my life. You are my muse. And every table that I set, every throw rug that I throw, is all for you. And you'll never have to craft alone, because... wherever you sew, I will sew beside you. What he said, But really... Boris, you make me a better person. You always give me that extra encouragement to go after my dreams, and you make me believe in myself. And now, with the power vested in me, as the morning host of "Waking up with Channel 55"... I now pronounce you husband and wife. Boris, you may kiss the bride. Smile. Just the get the... Oh. Well, you know, I just want it to be perfect. Let's see the ring. Hey, have you seen Violet? She's probably saying goodbye to her plants. Goodbye? She's leaving tomorrow. She wanted to leave as soon as possible so she didn't have time to chicken out. For China? Of course China. You know, she won't admit it, but I can tell she's really disappointed you didn't want to go. I didn't say I didn't want to go. I just... Will you excuse me? You look like a dream. Jack. So, China tomorrow? Yup. How long are you planning on being gone for? I don't know. Two months, maybe three. I mean, if our hunch is correct, I don't think it's gonna take long to find the Youtan. Norman said he'd look after the shop for me while I'm gone. So, two months? Maybe three. You know, a friend of mine recently told me about the importance of following your dreams. Sounds like a very smart friend. The smartest one I've got. Probably extremely well-read as a child. Yeah, probably. So, at the risk of bringing the entire legal community to a grinding halt with my delayed employment... I think I'd like to follow my friend's advice. For years, my dream has been to find the Youtan, but... now my dream is find it with you, Violet. It's really nice when two people share a dream. Yeah. It is. Well, I've got some packing to do. Yeah, you do. But first... Boris and Olivia's celebrity wedding went against the tide of extravagant soirees and opted instead for a simple, delicate elegance. Boris and Olivia want thank Violet Markey from Romance and Bloom flower shop and Cindy Stofferwitz... the best wedding planner in the city! I'm so proud of you, baby. So sweet! And the shop has been getting tons of orders since the wedding went viral. Well, that'll be keeping me busy for at least the next few weeks. Or I should say us. Roe says she's willing to lend a helping hand. All right, well don't have too much fun, you two. We have a plane to catch. Yes. And trust me, I have waited too long to miss this flight. I'm gonna miss you. We'll be back so soon, and then we are taking wedding season by storm. Bye bye. Oh, Violet, I am just so proud of you. Thank you so much, Dr. Rose. For everything. Okay. Bye, guys. - Ready? - Yeah. - Bye-bye! - See ya. Violet... Thank you for reigniting my dream, my whole life. I could say the exact same thing about you, book thief. Hop on. Hop on. Okay. Hang on tight. ♪ I'm okay to love you baby ♪ I think I'll catch the love fever ♪ ♪ Yeah my heart has a disease that has made me a believer ♪ ♪ Catch the love fever ♪ It's no viral infection ♪ It's a stronger connection to love ♪ ♪ Oh love
