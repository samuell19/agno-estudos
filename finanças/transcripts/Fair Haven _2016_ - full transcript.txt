(glass breaking) (gentle music) (gentle music) - [James] I'm better now. I think it helped. - [Richard] That's good. - [James] Have thing's been busy? - [Richard] Things are always busy, James. - I was thinkin', I could just rent a U-Haul and drive myself to Boston. That way you don't have to leave the farm. What do you think? - We need to talk about you going to college. (dramatic music) James. - That was my money. You had no right to use it. - Sometimes life isn't fair. We both know that. There were hospital bills and a funeral had to be paid for. Not to mention your treatment. Look, I've been puttin' some money away while you were gone. So, if you can just help me with the harvest next Fall, then maybe you can go to college in a year. - I already deferred my enrollment once to give my spot to somebody else. - I'm doin' my best, James. Jesus. (dramatic music) - [Therapist] When was the last time you fantasized sexually about men? - About four months ago, I guess. - Nothing since then? No dreams? Daydreams? - No. - What about women? - I think about women often. - And what do you think about while you masturbate? - I don't masturbate. - You looking forward to going home? - [James] No, I've had a very nice time here. - I'm not trying to trick you. - I'm sure it'll be very nice. - Have you spoken to your father lately? - He called on my birthday. - Oh, how's he doin'? - Seems fine. - James, did your father ever seek counseling after your mother passed away? He might not have dealt with his grief. - My father's a very strong man. I don't think he'll need therapy for anything. - Sometimes even strong people need someone to talk to. I'm sure he'll be glad to have you around before you head off to... Berklee College of Music You must be looking forward to that. - Yeah, yes, very much. - When you came here, you said your greatest desire is to become a concert pianist. Is that still the case? - Well, I'd still like to, but it's not the most important thing in my life anymore. - [Therapist] What is now? - God. I'd like to settle down, meet a girl, have a family. - Well, I'm sure you can still fit music in there somewhere. Being away from home, you're going to find yourself in a lot of new situations. There's gonna be a lot of temptations out there for you. - I know. I'll be good. - I'm sure you will. Well, I think that about does it. Once more for the road then. Our Father who art in heaven, we ask you to bless James as he goes forth from here today, to watch over him as he walks through temptation, guide him, help him, deliver him from evil, lead him on Your path to salvation. Help him to avoid the sins of the flesh and to embrace the glory of Your light. We ask these things in Your name, O Lord, and pray. Amen. - [James] Amen. (gentle music) (music drowns out dialogue on television) (gentle music) (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - God damn it! - [James] You okay? - Yeah, just stupid. Watch that handle, it's really hot. - All right. - You know, I've been thinking, maybe taking a course at the community college wouldn't be a bad idea. Give you a leg up. - I don't know what courses they have. I don't know if Berklee will accept them. - Well, if I were you, I wouldn't go to Boston. I'd stay closer to home. Vermont Tech's a good school. - Yeah, Dad, I'm studying music. - To what? Be a teacher? - Maybe, or play. - Okay. - [James] It's what I wanna do. - Well, minor in it then. Look, if I'm paying for this, I want you to major in either agriculture or business or something like that. - Well, then maybe I oughta pay for it. (chuckling) - [Richard] How you gonna do that? - Find a job. - [Richard] Doing what? - Whatever I have to. - Minimum wage is not gonna pay your bills and school both. - Damn it. I'll figure it out. - Why do you have to make things so difficult? I'm trying to do what's best for you. You know, one day you're gonna inherit this place. You're gonna have this place all to yourself. - Yeah, not anytime soon. - Well, we can hope not. But when you do, I want you to be able to run it. - When it's mine, I intend to sell it. - No, you will not sell this farm. This farm was your grandfather's, this farm was my grandfather's. This place is home. This place is a roof over your head, it's money in the bank when you need it. You don't understand that now. You have no idea, but one day you'll appreciate it. Why can't you see I'm just trying to do what's best for you? (dramatic music) - I'll take a look at those classes at the community college, Dad. - I'd appreciate it. - Yeah. (gentle music) - [Richard] You can just drive around back to the loading dock, and beep the horn, and somebody will come give you a hand. Make sure you get a receipt. Can you handle that? - [James] Yeah. (engine starting) (horn beeping) (horn beeping) - James? When did you get back? - A few days ago. - [Charlie] How are you? - I'm fine. - They got to you. Didn't they? - I need to drop these off and get goin'. We can't be friends anymore, okay? - Friends. - Yeah, I can't be around you. - I see. - Things are different now. I'm different. - Sure you are. - I gotta go. (engine starting) (dramatic music) - [Therapist] How are you feeling right now? - [James] Sad. - [Therapist] Can you expand on that? Sad. How? Describe it. - Alone. I feel alone. Lonely. - [Therapist] Do you miss your mother? - Yes. - Your father? What about your friends? Were you close to them? Did you have any special friends? - You mean like best friends? - [Therapist] More special than that. You have a girlfriend? - No. - What about a boyfriend? It's okay, you can tell me. - Yes. - [Therapist] How many? - One. - [Therapist] What was his name? - Charlie. - Were you intimate? It's okay, you can tell me. - Sometimes. - [Therapist] How'd that make you feel? - I, I, I don't know. Good, I guess. - Sin makes us feel good while we're committing it, James, but that doesn't mean it's good for us. It can really mess us up inside. And then when we're done, feel bad about it. Does that make sense? - Yes. - [Therapist] Charlie is like a drug. It's hard being away from him right now. I know, but, being with him would be worse. Once he's out of your system I promise you, you're going to feel so much better, and then you're gonna wonder why you ever had him in your life. (dramatic music) - Did you get that receipt? Well? - Hey, Dad, can you take care of those deliveries from now on? - [Richard] Why? I give you one simple job, you can't even do that? - Forget it. (horn blaring) I need the receipts. - What? - I need the receipts for the apples. Damn it. All right, let's hurry it up, please. - What did they do to you? - Don't worry about it. - Are you happier? Well, you seem happier. (dramatic music) Maybe I should sign up for a round. It did wonders for you. (grunts) (dramatic music) - I wanna go to church. - What now? - No, Sunday. That all right? - Yeah, I guess. - When you were slaves of sin, you are free in regard to righteousness. So what fruit did you then get from the things of which are now ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been freed from sin, and enslaved to God, the fruit that you get is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, and the gift of God is eternal life. In Jesus Christ our Lord. (church music) Thank you. Thank you. All right, thank you. - [Boy] Nice sermon, Pastor. - [Pastor] Thank you, Lucy. Richard, James, so great to have you back with us. How have you been holding up? - Ah, we're doing all right. - Well, that's good to hear. How old are you now? - 19. 19, well my Suzy just turned 19. She's going to UVM in the Fall. - That's a good school. James is thinking about Vermont Tech. Maybe Suzy could give him some advice. - I'm sure she would love that. Hang on. Suzy, could you come here, honey. Suzy, you remember James? - Yeah, not well, we were a year apart in school. - Well, he's going to college in the Fall, and maybe you can help him with his application. - Yeah, I would love to. Let me give you my number. - Yeah. Yeah, sure. (gentle music) ♪ I sent away ♪ For a treasured life (knocking) Hey. - That looks good. - How many can I take? - One should be enough for now. - Okay. - [Richard] Did you call Suzy yet? - No. - [Richard] She seems like a nice girl. Pretty too. - Yeah. ♪ In the morning air - Yeah. ♪ The trees were ripe ♪ And you were there ♪ You're not here - [Pastor] James. - [James] Hi. - Come on in. How are you? - Good. - Great. Suzy. She'll be right down. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - So, do you wanna come to my room? - [James] Okay. (gentle music) - Here's my application letter if you wanna take a look at it. - Yeah, thank you. - I get the feeling you're not really looking for help with this. - No, no, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude. - Why the lack of interest? - My Dad wants me to apply to state schools, but I was... Well, I'd like to go somewhere else. - Well, where do you wanna go? - Well, I was accepted into Berklee College of Music in Boston. - Wow. Congratulations. - Thank you. My Dad says it's not practical though. - Oh, I see. - [James] Yeah. - And he's probably just tryin' to do what he thinks is best for ya. - [James] You're engaged? - No. It's a promise ring. - What is that? - [Suzy] It means I've promised to stay a virgin until I'm married. (chuckles) It's silly, it's okay. - No, no. I don't think so. - Oh. (gentle music) - Well, you know, I should, I should keep going. I have a lot of deliveries and stuff to do, so... - Okay. Well, I'm sorry I wasn't very much help. - No, no. No, don't worry about it. I'll figure it out. - And if you have anymore questions, you have my number. - Yeah, yeah. - Of if you just wanna hang out. I mean, that would be fun too. - Hang out? - Yeah. We could grab some dinner or see a movie or something fun. - Sure. - I mean we don't have to if you don't want to. - No, no no. We, we. Yeah, yeah. I need to to check my schedule, you know, but I'll give you a call. - Okay. - Yeah, all right. - Okay. - Bye. (gentle music) (horn blaring) - Be right back with your receipts. - Hey. Sorry for how I acted the other day. - You should be. I don't agree with this. But if you're gonna be coming by here a lot, we can at least be civil. - Yeah. (dramatic music) - [Therapist] Did your father ever hit you? - No. Why are we doing this? - I'm trying to establish if there's been any emotional trauma in your life. Something that happened a long time ago that you may have forgotten about. - I don't think so. I think I'd remember it. - No, not necessarily. We often repress difficult or painful memories. If something like that did happen, if you were abused or mistreated, for instance, that could help explain your situation now. And if that's the case, working on that might help you to transition back to healthy, heterosexual desires. - Like I'd be interested in girls? - I believe you already are deep down. That's what nature intended you to be. Something just knocked you off course along the way. - I mean, I wasn't abused or molested or anything like that. - Okay, that's great. We'll look for another explanation then. You and I can work on finding that together. I wanna help you, James, but you have to want it too. - I do. - Good. Won't be easy. You have to work at it. You're gonna have to push yourself toward healthy behavior, try to avoid temptation. Everyone is different. You have have tremendous success and walk out of here a totally heterosexual young man, or you may always struggle with your feelings. (dramatic music) (gentle music) - Hello. Hi, it's James. How are you? Good, good good, I'm good. Yeah, listen, I was thinking about what you said, and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to grab dinner tonight. Yeah, yeah sure. All right, sure. Sure, so six o'clock. Yeah, all right, great. Great, I'll see you then. Okay. All right, bye. (gentle music) (knocking) Yeah? - I was headin' into town. I just wondered if you needed some supplies. - No, no no, I'm fine. - You gotta buy books, don't ya? - Yeah, I won't know until class starts. - Well here. If you need more, let me know. - [James] Okay. - Are you goin' somewhere? - Yeah, I was going to grab dinner with Suzy. - Ah, where you goin'? - Oh... I don't know. - Just take her to Ruby's. Oh, I know it doesn't look like much, but the food's really good, honest. Here, my treat. Have a big time. - Thanks. (dramatic music) (country music) We can go somewhere else. - No. No, this is fine, and there's lots of personality. - You sure? - [Suzy] Absolutely. - You kids want an appetizer? - What do you have? - Chips, pretzels, peanuts. - I think we're okay for now. - [Waitress] All right. Let me know when you're ready to order. - Thank you. I'm sorry. - Don't be. My Dad was always saying this place is a pit of sins, so I've been dying to see why. (laughs) I'm kidding. It's fine, it's fine. In fact, I wish we would have done this sooner. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. I wish we would have known each other in high school. - Yeah. - Just running in different crowds I guess. You were always with Brad Miller and Charlie Green. Is it true what they said about Charlie? - What did they say? - He's gay. - I don't think I should reveal the details of other people's... (gasping) - That's crazy. Wow. - Does it bother you? - I think people ought to be free to live their lives however they like. Well, thanks again. - Yeah. It was a really good time. - I guess I'll see you around. - Yeah. - Um... - Oh. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. - No no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I... - I should get inside. - No, no, no, no. Listen, listen. I um... I like to take things slower, you know. I think slow is better for me. - [Suzy] Okay. - Yeah. But look, I'd like for this to be a... You know, if you want. - Yeah, sure, if you do. - Yeah, yeah, I do. - Okay, well, I should get inside. Bye. - Yeah. (dramatic music) - You're still dreaming about girls sexually? Does anyone know why we have dreams? Dreams are our brain's way of making sense of the things that we experience during the day. So, if, for instance, we see a dog when we're awake, and we think about that dog, we might dream about it at night when our brain is sorting out those memories. Does that make sense? So, if you're having sexual dreams about women at night, it's probably because you're thinking about them sexually during the day. - But I wasn't. - It's okay, it's okay. Everyone slips up from time to time. You just have to focus and try your best to stay away from thoughts and situations that will lead you down the wrong path. Remember, your body wants you to be attracted to the opposite sex. - Why is that? - Because that's what God intended. - I'm not sure I believe in God. - Well, that's okay, James. He believes in you. God made Adam and Eve. One man and one woman, because that's what's required to have a baby. Not two men, not two women, not three people of various genders. One and one. And that's not just true with people. It's also true in the animal kingdom. One male lion and one female lion can make a baby lion. One male zebra and one female zebra can make a baby zebra. One male shark... - All right. I get it. - It's in your genes. Your body wants you to be with a woman so that you can make babies and carry on the species. - [Woman] I don't think I want babies. - Well, maybe not right now, but one day you will, when you're ready. And you won't be able to have them with another woman. (gentle music) (music drowns out dialogue) - [Richard] You know, it's just not for sale. It's been in the family for generations. - [Customer] Okay, we were, you know interested in kind of taking your orchard in a different direction. - [Woman] A lot of people in our area are starting to buy more organic. - [Male Customer] Yeah. - [Woman] That's the direction they seem to be goin'. - That's true. A lot of the grocery stores, you know, they really got a lot of interest in it, and I think they're paying a premium for organic apples and... - [Richard] Well, good luck with that, but the place ain't for sale. - Okay. Well, it's a shame, you've got a beautiful property here. - There's nothing we can do to change your mind? - [Richard] No, I don't think so. - Okay then. Let me give you my card, and if you change your mind give us a call. - [Richard] You don't need to waste one of your cards. - No, please. Keep it. - [Woman] Thank you for your time. - [Richard] All right, well, good luck. - [Woman] Thank you. - [Male Customer] Thank you. - Hey. - [Richard] Hey. - Who were those people? - [Richard] Couple of weirdos. - Oh yeah? - [Richard] Yeah. - What'd they want? - [Richard] They wanted to buy the farm. - Great, well, what did you tell them? - [Richard] What do you think I told them? - Say what they wanted to do with it? - They wanna modernize it, go organic. I told them the apples are already organic. They come right out of the ground. - I think they meant they wanna use less pesticides, Dad. - [Richard] Well, they're not very good farmers then, are they? - A lot of people are startin' to think like them. - It's a fad, it'll pass. - I'm just sayin' we oughta look into it. That's all. - James, I appreciate you wanting to help, but trust me when I say I know what the hell I'm doin', okay? Now, when you're runnin' the show, you can grow apples anyway you want. Maybe then you'll find out your old man knew what he was talkin' about. You still in your pajamas? (dramatic music) (horn beeping) - Sorry, I'm running behind today. - [James] What happened to you? - I ran into a door. - Charlie. - A couple of guys jumped me after work. - Here? - No. Down the road. I've been walking home since my car died. - No, you can't walk all the way back to your place form here. - Look, it won't happen again, okay. I got my guard up this time. - You're not walking anymore. Let me drive you. - James, I don't need an escort. - I don't care. What time is your shift over? - James. - What time is your shift over? - Nine. - Okay. I'll see you at nine. (laughing) - [Richard] Here he comes. - Hi. - Hey. What's goin' on? - Just wanted to drop by and surprise ya. Hope that's okay. - Ah yeah. Sure. - Well, it was nice talkin' to ya. - Yeah, you too. So, my parents wanted me to invite you to dinner tonight. - Oh. You know, my Dad, actually, is gonna be be cooking dinner tonight. - [Suzy] Oh. Well, I just told him I was gonna invite you to dinner with us, and he said he didn't mind eating alone. - Oh. - If you don't wanna come, that's... - No, no, no. I do, I do. - Okay. - What time? - 7:30. - Okay. - Great. - Yeah. - [Suzie] I'll see you then. - [James] All right. - [Suzie] Bye. - Steak. You're gettin' pretty handy with the oven. - Actually, it's not bad. - Yeah? - Hey, you look nice. - Thanks. - You can tell your girlfriend come on over for dinner over here next time. - You can keep practicing. I don't wanna poison her. - Hey. Your mom would be proud of ya. (dramatic music) Have a good time. (door creaking) (dramatic music) - How are things are the farm, James? We drive by there almost everyday, don't we? - [Mother] All time time. - Yeah, it's gorgeous. - [Mother] It is. - So nice. So what is it like working at an apple farm? - It's fine I guess. A lot of work. - I'll bet. How long's it been in your family now? - Long time. - Isn't that something. - That's incredible. - All right. It's only Fair Haven apples for us from now on. (laughing) - And Suzy tells us that you play music as well. - Yes, yes, I do piano. - Oh that's lovely. You'll have to play something for us sometime. - Oh, gladly. Do you have a piano? - No, we don't. - Oh. - James is gonna take over the farm someday. - Oh. - Well, that's great. That's very admirable. Keeping the family business going. A lot of kids these days, they want nothing to do with tradition, and soon as they graduate school, pow, they're gone. - [Mother] It's so true. - [Father] But it's good to hear you'll be staying in area long term. I mean, you know, we wouldn't want you whisking our daughter off to God knows where. - [Suzy] Dad! - (laughing) - [Mother] Oh, stop it. You're gonna scare him. - [Father] Oh, come on, I'm kidding. He knows I'm joking, right, James? - Yes, sir. - [Father] I mean, come on. It's not like I mention their children. (laughing) What do ya feel about children, huh? Do you want some someday? - Is that clock right? - Yes. - Sorry, I have to run. Dinner was wonderful. Thank you so much for everything. - James. James. Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I just forgot I have something to do at nine. - My Dad was just joking around. - Oh, no, it's fine. I gotta run. - Hey. - [James] How bad is it? - [Charlie] Not bad. - Maybe you should start carrying mace. - I just need to get out of this town. - You still thinking of joining the circus? - That was a good idea. - [James] No, it wasn't. - I could have been the most famous sword swallower in all of America at this point. - Oh yeah? Why don't you then? - Because you wouldn't come with me. - [James] Here, here. I got it. - Thanks. - Sure. - [Charlie] See you tomorrow? (dramatic music) - [Therapist] What you felt for your boyfriend wasn't love. It was lust. - You don't know that. - Love is different. Think about your parents, right now. Your mothers and your fathers. Think about how they make you feel. That's love. Now, think about someone of the same sex that you're attracted to. - It feels similar. - Sometimes we remember things the way we prefer them to be, not the way they actually were. The way you described your relationship, when you and your boyfriend were together, you can hardly keep your clothes on. That's not true love. There's nothing pure or beautiful about that. It's lust. It's pleasures of the flesh. If you were to run into your boyfriend again right now, you'd probably yearn to be with him. You'd want him to touch you, to hug you, to kiss you, but that's the devil's influence. Sin is very attractive. You have to fight against it. - It's different with girls? - Sometimes. Sure, you can lust after girls, but you can also fall in love with one. And believe me, that's worth waiting for. You can't fall in love with a man. It's impossible. - How do you know? - My Father told me. Right here. You follow this, and you'll know the difference. (dramatic music) - Oh fuck! God damn it. - Havin' trouble? - What the hell's it look like? - [James] What's goin' on? You all right over there? - Those yuppies came back again this morning. - [James] Who? - The ones trying to buy the place. - I thought you told them no. - I did. They thought maybe I'd change my mind, they gave me a better offer. - How much? - [Richard] Doesn't matter. - Just curious. - Not enough. Place is worth more than money. - Yeah, but how much money? - 750. - 750,000 dollars? - [Richard] Uh-huh. - Dad, why'd you say no? - I told you. - No, no no. With that kind of money, we could do whatever we wanted. You could retire. - [Richard] I told you I'm not selling the place! - I could go to school for God's sake, with that kind of cash. - James, I'm not gonna discuss anymore, all right. You got chores to do, go do 'em. Now. Jesus. Come on, you son of a bitch. (piano music) Play that one your mom used to play. You know the one I like, that... (humming) (sobbing) I would like to hear that one again. (somber music) Please. - [James] He won't even consider what I want. All he cares about is his stupid family legacy. - [Charlie] It's your family too. - [James] I don't care about it. I want my own life. With that kind of money, I could do anything. - I guess there's only one thing left to do. We'll have to kill him. - That's not funny. - It was a little funny. - No, it wasn't. - Seriously though. I don't think you should let your Dad choose what you wanna do with your life. - What other choice do I have? - Tons. You have nothing but choices. What, so he won't make it easy for you? Big deal. Move out and do it on your own. - It's too hard. - Oh, boo hoo, it's too hard. So life's rough for a few years. Then you'll be great. Or you could just sit here, do what you're told, stay here and be miserable. (lively music) Thanks for the ride. - Yeah, no problem. - Can I make it up to you? - No, no, don't worry about it. - Why don't we get a bite to eat sometime? As friends. Nothing weird, I promise. (dramatic music) - When? - I'm free Saturday night. (dramatic music) - All right. - Okay. Pick me up at six? - [James] Yeah. - Okay. See you. (dramatic music) (engine starting) (phone ringing) (door creaking) - [James] Good? - [Charlie] Yeah. - Yeah, my Dad's been teaching himself how to cook, so not bad now actually. - See, he doesn't need you. - Naw, he needs my help on the farm. My mom would want me to stay. - Your mom would want you to live your life. Hey. What was it like there? (dramatic music) - My Dad found the place online. I don't know if he even knew what he was looking for, but, I think he knew that they were Christian therapists, and, it was always a big part of my mom's life. Felt so bad at first. Had a lot of grief and anger. Was mad at God and my mom and... They helped me get past that. And they said if I wanted someone to blame, I really oughta blame myself. They said that sometimes we don't live our lives according to God's plan, He sends us a sign to get us back on track. - I hope you don't believe that. - I started to. (gentle music) - [Charlie] Are you okay? - [James] Yeah, yeah. - [Charlie] You still as fast as you used to me? - What? (laughing) (gentle music) What the hell? (laughing) ♪ The moon ♪ Seems like a romantic spot ♪ To build a staircase to ♪ The moon ♪ Seems like a romantic spot - [Charlie] Hey, hey. This way. - [James] All right. ♪ Just for me and you ♪ Why can't we ♪ Say goodbye ♪ When we ♪ Need to ♪ Why can't we say goodbye ♪ Why can't ♪ We say goodbye ♪ When we need to ♪ Why can't we ♪ Say goodbye (laughing) - James, you gonna sleep all day? (phone ringing) (dramatic music) James. (phone ringing) (laughing) (gentle music) - Not yet. - I'm sorry. - What time is it? - I don't know. Someone just threw my phone. (laughing) We should get up. Yes. - No. - Before my Dad wakes up. - No. - And kills us. - No. (laughing) No. (phone ringing) Hi. - [James] Hi. - I really missed you. - I missed you too. - What the hell is that? - Suzy. Suzy. Suzy. Suzy, wait. Suzy. Suzy, Suzy, wait. Listen, I'm sorry. - You bastard. You're a bastard! Don't touch me! - Wait a second. Will you listen to me? - You know what you are? You're disgusting. You're pathetic. Rot in hell. - Hey. (engine starting) You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - James. - Go wait in the truck. - Yeah. - Hi. Listen, that probably looked pretty bad. I had to break up with Suzy just now, and Charlie's a friend from... - Just stop. I honestly have no idea what to do. I mean, maybe if your mother was here she would know, but I have no idea. - About what? - About you. About how to help ya. - Help me with what? - To help ya grow up, help ya be a man. - I am a man. - Yeah, you're one hell of a man. - Go ahead. Say it. Go ahead, say it. No, no no. Come on, I want you to. Oh, that's okay. You were never the kind of man I wanted for a father either. If Mom saw you now, she'd be ashamed, you know that? - That makes two of us I guess. - [James] I guess. (dramatic music) (country music) - Well, look what the pole cat dragged in. Haven't seen you in a while, Ricky. Awfully early to be piss drunk. - You want my money or not? - [Bartender] Saw your boy in here a while back with a pretty girl. - Not my boy. I don't even know him. - [Bartender] Well, I'm sure every father said that about their boy at some point or another. - Bullshit. I minded my old man. - Didn't you tell me one time about when you were 17, you wanted to run away 'cause your old man wouldn't let you join the army? - You don't remember as well as you think you do. - [Bartender] Oh no? - No. I was 18, it was the marines. And I would have made a damn fine one too. - Oh, of course you would. You ever think about that? - What, marines? - You could have seen the world, never know where you would have ended up. - You don't always get what you want in this life. - So, I hear there's this really nice couple pokin' around town lately, looking to buy up some land. They been out to see you? - They have. - And how was their offer? - Insufficient. - That is a shame. If it were more, you might be able to get out of the apple business. Live a little. - I'm not a young man anymore. - Well, you're not worn out either. - See you around. - Take care, Ricky. Don't be a stranger. (dramatic music) - What about your Dad? - I don't know. I don't think I can go home. - You think he'll hurt you? - No. No. I just don't think he wants me there anymore. - Then stay with me. - That's not a permanent solution. - Then we'll leave. - Oh yeah? Where would we go? - I don't know. Enter the circus. - I'll just go, and, pack my clothes, whatever else I need. Then leave. And then the circus. Okay. (gentle music) - [Cashier] All right, here you go. - [Customer] Thank you. - [Cashier] You're welcome. Have a great day. Hey Rich. - [Richard] Hey. - How's the apple business? - [Richard] Oh, it's fine, just fine. Listen, I'm sorry they're so late. - Oh, don't worry about it. I'll grab your receipt. - [Richard] Thanks. - Excuse me. - [Richard] Oh sure. - Here you go. - So, a lot of folks go for the organic? - Yeah, actually, they're very popular. Let's see, Winston Clark switched to organic. You know Winston? - [Richard] Yeah. - Yeah. And the Shelleys. The Shelleys were here on Monday. They said they're thinking about it. I'll see you later. - All right. - Hi, how can I help you? That's it. All right. Okay, that will be 11 dollars. (dramatic music) (gentle piano music) - [Richard] Play it better than she did. - [James] I was... - [Richard] James. - [James] I was just leaving. I really don't wanna talk about this right now. - Just wait. Sit down. Please. For a minute. Where you goin'? - I was thinking of going to Boston. - [Richard] Alone? - No. - Is he... What's his name again? - Charlie. - Charlie. Is he the one from before? - Yeah. - Your mother and I were pretty concerned about that. That's how you ended up at that place. I'm sorry about that. Ah... You care about each other? - Yeah. Yeah, we do, very much. (gentle music) - That's good. I wanna apologize for what I said yesterday. That wasn't right. I don't know if I'll ever understand it, but, I think I can do a better job of accepting it. - Thank you. (gentle music) - I've decided to sell the farm. - What? - [Richard] I took their offer. - Why, why did you? - You know, I've been running this place for the last 20 years for my Dad, when I should have been running it for you. I'll give you some of the money. You can go to school, move away, do whatever you want. I guess I'll retire. Anyway. The farm isn't family, we are. - Dad, I'm sorry that things didn't really work out. - Don't. That's life. We'll just do the best we can, okay? - Okay. (gentle music) - [Richard] You didn't miss it. - [James] No, no. I still got about 10 minutes. - [Richard] Okay, then. - [James] Well, I should, we should... - Yeah. I... Call if you need anything. - I will. - Your mother would have been proud of you. I am too. (gentle music) Well, you better get goin'. - Yeah.
