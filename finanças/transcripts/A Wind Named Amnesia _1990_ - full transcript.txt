[Wataru] Sky. Blue. Blue sky. Clouds. White. White clouds. [gentle whistling] [wind blows] [typing] [beeping] [fire cackling] [radar] [grunts] [tense music] [yelling] [robot] You men are under arrest. Offer the least resistance and you die. Huh? That voice. Come with me, or I'll attack. [tires screech] [gun shots] Your calmness is extremely suspicious. You're under arrest. Follow my instructions. You're armed. Throw down your weapon immediately. [tires screech] Hit the turret. Aim for the turret. That's the nerve center. [explosion] Well done. Hey, you can talk? How come you can speak? That was brave. To fight a robot armed only with a magnum. - What was it? - A guardian. A decade ago, violent riots became increasingly frequent here in San Francisco. And the authorities developed these machines to maintain law and order. This particular guardian must have been on patrol when the wind struck. The pilot will have forgotten how to open his cockpit, or operator his ejector. But even after he died slowly, horribly of starvation or lack of oxygen, the computer which controlled his machine and which had been program to detain or destroy continued doing just that. The guardian of an authority that had long ceased to exist. - Let's go. - Okay. [tires screech] [Wataru] Who are you? What's your name? You know a lot. Things, words that I don't know. You haven't forgotten. Why? Well, to start with, I'm called Sophia. I don't want to say anymore about myself. Tell me your story. What's your name? Of course, I didn't know what my name was, so Johnny called me Wataru. He taught me all the words I know. And everything else come to that. [Sophia] Johnny? Mm. Mm-mm. Johnny was 13, three years younger than me. But Johnny knew all kinds of things that I didn't know. And when you learned them, you dumped him, huh? Not quite. He died. I buried him, then I hit the road. I'm from a little town in the foothills of the Rocky's called... I don't remember. It was an ordinary sort of place. If anything exciting ever happened, I've forgotten it. I think everybody knew everybody else. It must have been a friendly sort of place. [children giggling] Platoon, quick, march. [laughing] But then, out of a clear sky, the wind blew through our town. And suddenly, when it had past, everyone, not only in our town, but everyone maybe in the whole world had forgotten everything. How to fly planes, [explosion] [truck horn] how to drive. [explosion] Everything had been forgotten. It was as if we were all babies again, but babies with the strength of grown men and woman. Amnesia. It's called amnesia. No one was spared. The wind blew into every corner of the world, and where it blew, it wiped the slate of memory clean. Only instinct remained. I don't remember the following days and weeks to clearly. I just wondered around town, unknowing, helpless. And soon, people started to feel hungry. Food became the only necessity and people fought for it like savages. In my town, at least, there was still plenty for all but that had been forgotten. The old and weak were swept aside without mercy, parents abandoned their children, not even knowing they were theirs. And I? I was no better. No different than all the rest. I was hungry. That's all I knew. [gagging] [coughing] [glass shatters] [creaking] [eerie music] [crying] [growling] It wasn't an enemy, but my own reflection. I didn't understand. And I didn't understand the awful noise the children were making. I couldn't stand that noise. [crying continues] I didn't understand. I had to destroy that face staring at me. And then, I ran out of the house. I was screaming. I didn't know where I was going. I just kept running 'till the town was behind me. I didn't know where I was. Maybe I had been here before, but I couldn't remember. There was a large white building. Bodies everywhere. I had grown used to the sight of death and destruction. But here, in the bright sunshine of this silent place, I felt something darker. More terrible than anything I had yet come across. I felt something watching me. And then... Then I saw it. [rumbling] A huge man with wires attached to his head, his body, his arms and legs. Threatening a boy, who sat calm and still. They hadn't seen me. I wasn't in danger. But for some reason, which I couldn't have explained if I wanted to, I knew I had to do something to help that boy. [tense music] [rumbling] [groaning] [yells] [groans] [yelling] [gunshot] [yelling] The boy was holding something in his hand, pointing it toward where the man had fallen with smoke coming out at the front. Later I learned what it was. - Thanks. - Huh! Don't be afraid. Hey, you're from town. Tell me, He was talking to me using words. [Johnny] What's your name? [Wataru] But I had forgotten what they meant, or even how to make them. I couldn't speak, and I couldn't even begin to understand what he was saying. He took my hand, and that felt good. He smiled, and I felt less afraid. And that, that was how I met Johnny. [whirring] [glass shatters] I was in what Johnny called a military research base. They weren't just building new machines, they were turning people into human weapons. That's what Johnny was. And the man with the wires had been taught to move and destroy objects with his mind alone. But the program was only partly completed when the wind came. The doctors, the scientists lost their memories at once, but for some of the more advance patients, who'd been abandoned, the process took a little longer. Johnny told me they could have destroyed New York in an afternoon if the right code had been activated. Few of the experiments were not directly aimed at destruction, and Johnny's was one. He was the subject of the most advanced memory experiment of all. There's a limit to what human minds can retain. But data entered into a computer will remain there forever. It's memory keeps everything, useful or not. Johnny had a computer put into his head to take excess information directly from his brain. The wind that destroyed human memory couldn't effect the store in Johnny's computer memory. Johnny took me to the center's laboratory, which was still working, controlled by its computers. He put a machine over my head. I was scared. But by that time, I trusted him completely. [machines whirring] Thirty minutes later, I had the knowledge of a five year old. Where have I put my hand? [Wataru] On the desk. - Where's my hand now? - On the chair. And what's this white flower? It's called a rose. I tried to eat one. - What was its taste? - Uh. I can't explain what it was. But it made me throw up. I see. [gunshot] What am I holding? A pistol. - Hm, what am I called? - Wait a minute. I must have told you 10 times already. - My name's Johnny. - Johnny! I won't forget again. So much to remember. It's hard. You don't remember your name, do you? No, I don't. Let's think of what to call you. I suppose the name that describes the role you'll play in the world which the winds left us. - A name like Wataru. - Sounds pretty odd. It's a Japanese word that means traveler, which is what you'll be. Because your role will be to travel all over the world helping men to relearn what they have forgotten. [Wataru] Whatever my name had been before, from that day, I became Wataru. [birds chirping] I had one more session on Johnny's machine. After that, for some reason, it didn't work anymore. But thanks to the machine, I had learned a great deal. I understood that I was part of the human race. I learned that the land I saw about me was called Montana. That this was part of a country called America, which in turn, was part of a planet, Earth. And that this planet spinning around the sun was a tiny speck in the infinite universe. Most important of all, I was able to ask questions. And the most puzzling question was: What had happened to the world. You know what happened when the wind blew over the Earth. Everything that had been learned, everything men had achieved in the time since progressing from the apes was forgotten. Their memories were wiped clean. They forgot everything they created. The music, the paintings, the science. Even their families, their names. They forgot how to use their machines and what they were for. All these things were blow away. We know that. The question is not what happened, but what made it happen. For instance, a military experiment which was fired. A military experiment? You mean the forces destroyed the people they were really supposed to have been protecting? It's possible. I don't know. Perhaps we'll never know. But whoever's behind it, it's without a doubt the biggest catastrophe that's ever been seen in the world. It could have been unleashed by men who had become so convinced of their great wisdom, it never occurred to them their inventions where out of control. Or perhaps beings from another world looked down on man and saw he was becoming so dangerous to the universe that they were compelled to stop him. [relaxing music] [panting] Woo-hoo! [panting] [Wataru] Every day, Johnny taught me something new. Building on the basic knowledge his machine had given me. He taught me things I would need to know simply to survive. [gunshots] I'd practice until he was satisfied. He taught me how to drive. That the stars could be used to find out where I was. That some plants can be eaten, but some are poisonous. [birds chirping] He also taught me how to have fun. But as summer ended, Johnny began to grow weaker. Sometimes he would sleep the whole day. Or just lie quietly in his bed, too exhausted to move. [wind blows] [Wataru] How do you feel? [Johnny] Some days, I feel more full of life than ever. Look, Wataru. A pair of mountain blue birds. Winter's almost here. They'll fly south for the warmth of Colorado or California. But we won't see them again until next spring. They have no memory as we understand it, only instincts, so they have lost nothing. I envy them. The rules they live by are so simple. [Wataru] Going into town for food and gas was getting dangerous. I'd see gangs of men fighting with rocks and clubs. And now, disused buildings were starting to crumble and collapse. Johnny, the road into the town's nearly been cut by... Johnny was dead. I stood by his bed, and remembered the last words he had spoken to me. [Johnny] Wataru. You will soon have to leave here. I've tried to prepared you for a task, which no one else can complete. You must travel to the four corners of this land, perhaps right around the world, and see what is left of the things that man has built and done. Those you'll meet will have no memory of how their fathers slowly, slowly built up a way of living, which finally, perhaps not quite destroyed itself. Man has returned to a primitive basic state. You alone can understand that. You alone can look back on history and show man where their empty ambitions led. You must teach them new aims, new desires, to take them in a new direction where they will achieve what they are capable of. [sighs] [Wataru] And so I started my journey. I didn't know where I was going. It didn't matter. - I still don't understand. - What? Suppose that Johnny was right, and the wind was caused by beings from a different world. Assuming it wasn't a mistake, they must have had a definite plan. I can't answer you. Perhaps they didn't want to destroy man, but simply point them along a different way. Try to make them act in ways which aren't so destructive. What do you mean? Rescue him by disabling him? That makes no sense! Yes, it is puzzling. You can't assume that beings more powerful than man are necessarily wiser. We can't stay here any longer, Wataru. The guard whom you confronted has a computerized self-repair program. It won't be long before it resumes its search and destroy mission against you. [Wataru] Hey, I never got around to asking where you're heading. [Sophia] New York. [whistles] Quite a way. Think you'll make it one piece? Yes. But I know I'd have a better chance with you along. I told Johnny I'd go to all the big cities in America to see what I could do there. I'm not going to go back on my word. So if you don't mind some detours. No, I don't mind at all. Okay, then. Let's do it! Okay, let's. It's eerie being in this huge city that doesn't seem to have any people in it. Things may have gotten so tough, that everybody ran away. Huh? [Footsteps] [tense music] [grunting] - Wait! - But the girl! Be careful. You may not realize what's going on with these people, or exactly why they're after her. They've had to make up new rules because they found the old ones are no use to them any longer. Let me go! [gunshot] [chuckles] Don't be scared. You're okay now. Uh, um. See? [growls] Um, calm down. I think I can reach him. Let me talk to him. [growling] It's alright now. It's alright. [grunts] I've been able to communicate with them to some extent. Her name is Sue, he's called Little John. Their people have chosen her to be the bride of their god. Tomorrow is to have been the day of her marriage. Well, so what? Is that bad? It would not have been happy. She was about to be sacrificed. To a god? Human sacrifice? Yes. The god that they believe in demands a succession of brides. In return, he spares the rest of the people. [groans] [panting] [yelling] [screaming] Poor kid. No wonder she's got nightmares. But does their god really exist. Perhaps. What's important for you to remember is that the men who were chasing her believe it does. So to those men, sacrificing her to appease him is natural. It's disgusting! [Sophia] Sacrifices were offered to the gods for thousands of years after man first looked up and recognized unknowable forces ruling him. In terms of his history on earth, the custom was stopped only the blink of an eye, though. And now that the wind has blown away the old restraints, the old certainties, it's not surprising he's returned to it. And you. Are you so certain of your own values that you're prepared to impose them unthinkingly on others? To choose their way of life for them? To tell them what is good and what is bad? Demanding obedience by force if necessary? You don't understand yet. Anyway, the sacrificial ceremony or marriage, if they'd rather call it that, is scheduled to take place in front of their altar tomorrow night. If they recapture her by then. I feel for her. A marriage to a god, which she didn't want, wouldn't have been enough to make her run away. But if her life's threatened as well, she has the right to live her own life. Mm-hm. What? Have I said something funny? No. On the contrary, what you just said made perfect sense. [Wataru] It's dangerous for Sue to be outside in daylight. [Sophia] I don't think so. According to her, there are hardly any people left. They've all gone into the countryside where it's easier for them to find food. And so the chances of her meeting anyone who'll try to force her to return to face her sacrifice in a city as big as this is pretty small. Especially, if she's found herself such a faithful bodyguard. Sounds reasonable. Listen. Suppose we were to drive them both down to the beach for the afternoon. It wouldn't surprise me if they hadn't been there since the wind. [grunts] [giggles] [Wataru] I understand about Sue now, but what do you make of Little John? [Sophia] I haven't found out much about him. But I like the way he's so gentle with her. Do you care about her? Mm. I've made up my mind. We'll be taking them so she won't be sacrificed. And maybe, I can teach them a bit. Hey. [waves crashing] [seagulls] [giggling] Help! He's gone insane! Sophia, help me! [giggles] Calm down. [yells] [giggles] Oh... [gasps] You look great. No offense. Understand? No, of course you don't. Well, I'm going to find us something to eat, then hit the sack. We've got an early start tomorrow. Sophia! Here, see? I found some stuff for a party. Hey, where have Sue and Little John gone to? - Have they gone inside? - No, Wataru. They've just gone. Eh? Wasn't it obvious from the way Sue behaved today, what she felt? You must have noticed. Everything she did was as if she'd never have opportunity to repeat it. Everything was as if today was the last day she'd spend on earth. She knew that if she didn't go back, then some other girl would be sacrificed to the god in her place. So she returned. Shit! Where do you think you're going? I won't let them sacrifice Sue! I won't let them kill her because of some superstition! I'll rescue her! Her, and the other girls who are in danger. Get in! Little John dropped this when he ran after Sue. He doesn't know what it means, but he understand that there are rules different to those he lives by now. [eerie music] [drums] [chanting] [Sophia] It's a computerized urban-construction robot. As its chief function is to destroy buildings on sites that are to be redeveloped, it's equipped with powerful destructive devices. Added robot arms and laser canon. It's caterpillar traction allows it to move at great speed over any terrain. It can flatten a small city in a day. And it's this machine they worship as a god. [whirring] [music continues] Look, Wataru. Somehow, he must have learned how it works, which has given him power over the rest. Sue! [grunts] [rumbling] [explosion] [yelling] [laughing] Huh? Come on, Sue! Run! No! [electricity crackling] Sue! [screams] [explosion] You've destroyed him, Wataru. It's the end of their all-powerful god. [rumbling] Wataru? - What is it? - Wataru. I'll make a bet with you. A bet? You said Sue and Little John should come with us on our journey and you might teach them what you learned from Johnny on the way. They didn't come, and I'll bet that no one will join us. What do you want to bet? Somebody will want to learn. Okay, I'll take the bet. What's the stake? The future of this planet. Whether man will survive on it. Huh? [gun shots] [sad music] Yeah. And this is your badge of leadership. Sue's gone, Little John. You won't know anyone like her again, but maybe you can care for other people the way you cared for her. [sad music continues] [cheers] I wish I wasn't so sure I'll win our bet. We'll see. [eerie music] [beeping] Wataru. As a result of people you have met, have you learned yet what being a human being really means? They're a complex breed. It's not always easy to see what drives them on. Hm. What's driving you on, Wataru? What do you want? Tell me. It's hard to say. I'm not sure myself, but... Look up there. See those clouds in the sky? Maybe they're above a town, and in that town I'll meet somebody who can teach me all the things Johnny never had time to. Before the wind, man must have been curious about all kinds of things they've got no time for now. But I'm curious, and I want to learn. Yes, it's because they were curious that people progressed. All progress couldn't have been bad. - Quiet. - What's the matter? We're being followed. What? [tense music] It's hooked onto the back! [explosion] Don't die, Sophia. [clock ticks] You're a very lucky young man. No bones broken and not even serious cuts. Just one or two scratches and bruises. [groans] Where am I? Is Sophia alright? Is she here? Now, now, don't get excited. Just lie back and take it easy. I heard this terrible noise on the edge of town, and so I drove out to find what had caused it. And there was your jeep lying on its side next to a big crater with burnt grass all around it. You were unconscious, but otherwise, there was absolutely nothing wrong with you. I wish I had half your strength. Oh, there you are. I was amazed to discover that she got away without a scratch. Incredible. - Sophia. - I'll look in later. Sophia! Listen, how come he treated me? And how come he can talk? Haven't people in this part of the country lost their memories? Wow. [Sophia] The US government designed and built this eternal city at the beginning of the 21st century. The beauty of it is, is that it's completely self-contained with its own hospital, university, parks, suburbs and surfaces. The farms in the city limits are big enough to supply all the food that's required. The whole system's controlled by supercomputer. The guardians are programmed so they cannot enter. That's all fair enough, but why didn't people lose their memories here as well? We'll answer that later. For now you must sleep and get your strength back - so we can travel on. - Yeah. You're right. [clock ticks] [knock] Huh? [Door opens] Oh, miss. - Excuse me. - I don't answer to 'miss'. Call me charge nurse, which is who I am. And that's what I'd like to be called. - I hope that's clear. - Yes. I'm sorry, but you're so young. You just relax. I'll take care of everything. - Pull up your sleeve. - Oh, there. [knock] I've been trying to find you, burse. Back to bed at once! Really, Mr. Simpson. You know you're not allowed up even if you're feeling better. I know, but I felt so lonely without anyone else to talk to. Alright, I'll be there in a minute. You're really a terrible handful! [Wataru] What the hell is going on here? [cocks gun] [pants] [gasps] Mind if I join you, miss? Uh. Please do. I often see you reading here around this time. Yes. It's peaceful in the park. You know... I've wanted to talk to you for a long time. It's like a play. They're playing parts. Sophia! Are you beginning to figure it out? No, I'm not. What's going on? This is a very interesting place. Those two on that bench. What do you find so surprising about them? An old couple in the park. [pants] Ah, I've caught up with you at last. Thank god. The mayor would be delighted if you two could join her for a little supper this evening. Isn't that kind of her. If you'd like to take us. With pleasure. This way. [Wataru] This is weird. If you'll be seated. The mayor won't be long. Hey, this spread's amazing. I wonder who made it. Everything's run automatically by the computer. Those two have everything they want here. I can't imagine a reason for the pair of them should ever exchange this place for the outside. [mayor] Welcome to the eternal city. I'm so pleased you're well enough to have joined me. I wish I was as young and strong as you. Now, please, do begin. If you want something different, do please say. Come on, start. You've forgotten how lovely meals can look. [clock ticks] [whirring] Mm. May I ask a question that's bothering me? Yes, do. Do you know what happened to the rest of the world two years ago? Oh, yes. Well, then, why do you and Mr. Simpson still have memories? Not only your own, but those of other people as well? Huh? The answer isn't entirely clear even to me. But the wind affected us as well as you outside. It affected not only the people living here in the eternal city, but also the supercomputer which manages our affairs. It didn't forget, but it became very confused. Before it managed to repair itself, many lives were lost. The computer had been programmed to put the protection of the city above all else. In its damaged state, it mistook the unfamiliar violence of the people as that of enemies and killed many of them. The rest ran away. I've asked you here because I have a request to make. On the behalf of many Mr. Simpsons and Lisas who remain. Stay here with us. You can see how well the computer cares for us. The average lifespan here is no less than 104 years. If you live beyond that, we can still promise you a comfortable life. We can also guarantee your protection from the many dangers in the outside world. All your worries will be solved for you by the computer. What do you say? You mean, that you're inviting us both to become members of the cast of this charade which you play eternally? It's not a charade. It's our reality. And don't forget that this is now the only place in the world where a human being, thanks to the computer, can live with human dignity. Outside there is only ruin. Humans are reduced to the level of beasts. The strong devour the weak. I can't believe that you would willingly go back to such a situation. Think logically about it and you'll realize I'm right. Which do you find more desirable? The idyllic life in our city, which I described? Or the fear and violence which have become the main? Virtually, the only characteristics of life out there. So I'll ask you again. Will you accept our invitation to stay with us? No, I won't. You aren't right. I'm not sure how to say it, but something is missing from your description of life here and on the outside. You're prisoners. You're prisoners of thousands of memories. If that's your feeling. I'd hoped you would cooperate freely. I see now that you've been too brutalized by your experiences to appreciate my offer. But at least I gave you the chance. And you, young lady. Would you consider remaining? Behind your reasonable exterior, you, too, resort to force in the end. [electricity crackles] [explosion] But your city will one day turn to dust and your supercomputer is powerless to avert its fate. We'll see. You talk as though you were god. I have certain knowledge, but that does not make me god. Nor believe me, does it make me your enemy. But I shan't submit to the will of your supercomputer. Not even in exchange for peace. That would deny the being I am. Wataru. You know what I mean? Yes, and I agree. Dare you allow me to talk with the real Lisa, as well as the real Mr. Simpson? Yes, we'll see them, and hear what they say. We aren't afraid. [Wataru] Listen to me, Lisa. What I say to you isn't dictated by your computer. Look there. Thousands of people lived in this city when the wind blew across it. One they lost their memories and longer behaved rationally, the computer feared they would destroy the city, and killed them. Those who weren't killed fled, or died anyway. Your computer had had the ability to repair itself built into it. When it started operating properly again, it found that instead of a city full of people it had been programmed to care for, the real Mr. Simpson and you, it needed those other people to satisfy its program. So it reawakened their memories in you. I remember now. My god. The terrible weight of all those memories. You can put all that behind you. Come with us. With Sophia and me. You'll be free to go on with a life of your own, instead of being a puppet of the computer. You can speak with your own voice, see with your own eyes. [Sophia] You have to find words. Your own words. Tell them how exciting the journey will be. The flame of a sunset in Arizona. The majestic power of Niagara Falls taking their awesome drop. The sweet scents of apple blossom time. The burning heat of summer plains. The snowy chill of mountain peaks. You must persuade them these are still wonderful things to be seen. Even though what they see maybe the twilight of human civilization. Yes, Wataru. - Will you take me along, please? - Yes! That's wonderful. Lisa, it means you're free. [jeep engine] Mr. Simpson! I'm fed up with your behavior. How do you think you're going to get better if you don't take your medicine like a good boy? Ma'am, if you'd sign this. Thanks very much. I often come and read here. It's peaceful. I've wanted to speak to you for some time, but I suppose I've always been a little too shy. For luck, eh? Papa! Papa. Papa. Papa! Lisa! Papa! Hey, Lisa! Papa! [cries] Lisa! [clock rings] [Sophia] The peace and security she has here were too strong to resist. But the important thing is that she chose to stay. It wasn't the computer. She chose for herself. That's a huge step forward. Let's go. [tires screech] [whirring] [beeping] [electricity crackling] [beeping] Wa... Ta... Ru. Las Vegas. A city men built in a barren desert to feed their equally baron greed. The wind blew in this place became a dead monument of futile pleasure. [gentle music] Wataru, there's something I should tell you assuming you haven't guessed already. - Yeah? - We caused the wind and let it blow over the earth. It was no accident. It was done deliberately. Yes. I represent the power of a distant planet. We've kept watch on your world since life first appeared on it. The first creatures that crawled out of the water, the dinosaurs that ruled for so many centuries, and finally, the coming of man. Until very recently, you were not thought to be a danger to us, but when you broke free of the earth's gravity, we started to be afraid of your leaders' aggressiveness. That they'd attack. We weren't sure, but we couldn't take the risk. So you sent the wind. Yes. Though since we've met, I think it was a bit hard. There was a second reason beside the need to defend ourselves, and that was done for your own good. Men have always said that what they desire most is happiness, yet, their actions seem to lead the opposite way. By removing the baggage of their memories, we gave them the chance to make a new beginning. A beginning that might lead them towards the goal they claim to want. [wind blows] Well, now you know.

I've tried to prepare you for the task which only you can complete. You must travel to the farthest corners of this land, then even further afield. Wherever you find men you can persuade to listen to you. Look at what they've achieved in the past, and use the best of it. I'm trying. You know, Johnny. There's such a lot I don't understand. And I'm enjoying the trip with Sophia so much. If I'm serious about the job I've got to do, should I be enjoying myself? Am I just going to drift around until the time comes when you and I meet up again? [gentle music] What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. [Sophia] You're very quiet. [Wataru] Everything's fine. That's the trouble. [beeping] - Sophia. - Mm? On your planet, do you have sunsets like this? Do you? Um. [explosion] Bastard! [dramatic music] [beeping] [explosion] [tires screech] [Wataru] Well, this is it. New York. And you win the bet. I didn't pick up anyone on the road. [Sophia] Didn't you? Huh? You picked up Lisa and Simpson. I think you learned a bit yourself. Yeah. And now what are your plans? First, to destroy the guardian. My people built it, so I must destroy it. It's up to me to take the responsibility. Oh. So it's goodbye. It was fun. [tires screech] [bullets] [glass shatter] [gun fire] [explosion] [groans] Wa... Ta... Ru... [dramatic music] [explosion] Huh? [organ music] I learned from you as well. Now, we will learn something new together. Remember our first meeting. I'm fine, but how come you can speak? Remember San Francisco. Los Angeles. The eternal city. Wataru. Will you take me along, please? [Wataru] Lisa! [Sophia] Remember as you continue your journey. Until someday, somewhere, you will find someone to share your task, and carry it on when you've gone. I'll never forget, Wataru. What we've done together. What we've seen, who we met. Farewell, earth traveler. [Wataru] What's that? [Sophia] It's the ship carrying my people. [Wataru] Uh-huh. What will happen now? Will you return our memories? [Sophia] I don't know. Is it better for man to have memories or not? Is there more pain in them or less? Are they more violent or less? [Wataru] How will you decide? [Sophia] It's not my decision. I'll tell them what I've seen here, and about you. Then it'll be decided. It's time to go. Yes. [soft music] [Johnny] Let's see now. Maybe I'll call you Wataru. [Wataru] What does that mean? It's a Japanese word that means traveler. That's what you're going to be. And wherever you go, you will teach men what you've forgotten. That's right. I'm just at the beginning of a lifetime's work. [Johnny] See that leaf? You can make music with that. Here, let me show you. [gently whistling] [Johnny laughs] That's it. You're learning. You're learning.
