[Ding ding] Hello, Parrish. We're taking the noon plane for Connecticut, skipper. I sure hate saying good-bye. Oh, me, too, Parrish. You're the best deck hand I ever had. The only reason mother's taking this job is to keep me from deck handing full-time. I don't know if i'm doing the right thing or not by giving in. There comes a time when all mas and pas have to give up their kids. Comes hard, too. I've got to decide some things for myself. That's the important thing, lad. Oh, it don't matter whether you're working ferryboating or--or being president. What does matter is that you decide what you want out of life. [Ding ding] P.A.: This is the captain speaking. As we emerge from the clouds, you will find that we are flying down the beautiful Connecticut river valley. Those great white sheets you see are tents. They're covering 6,000 acres of shade tobacco, the finest tobacco, they say, in all the world. Now, how can you tell I've been a tobacco man all my life, ma'am? Oh, I just sensed that you knew all there was to know about it. Well, not as much as sala post, but then nobody knows more about tobacco than sala. It's in his blood. His folks have been farming this same land since the pilgrims. I never saw barns so close together. You don't know much about tobacco, eh, kid? Well, up around Boston we don't grow tobacco, we just smoke it. That's a riot. But them ain't barns, they're tobacco sheds. You can tell by them loose boards on the sides to let the air in. What do you do for Mr. Post, teet? Well, it depends on the season, ma'am. I drive tractor, plow, harvest, sow and seed, steam and sterilize, fertilize and set, cultivate and hoe, sucker, tie up and wrap, pick, salt, soak, cure, pull cloth, chop, stalk, strip lands, packs, hands, crates, ships, and warehouse here to dock. Well, I gather you're very fond of Mr. Post. Well, you don't get fond of sala, ma'am. You kind of respect him, know what I mean? [Birds chirping] Uh-oh, the big man's here. Who's that? Judd raike. See that gold and red "r"? That's on everything raike owns and controls, meaning half the valley. He even swiped half of sala's land a few years back. Well, so long, kid. Lots of luck with sala. Man: I don't care. Let him. Let him. I say let oermeyer go under. 2 years ago he had wireworms. Last year he had blue mold and passed it on to Tully and all my farms in his area along with it. Why should you want to finance him into another disaster? Because Carl oermeyer is my neighbor, and he's had bad luck. Oh, bad luck. Yes, this could happen to you or to me. All right, I warn you. If he infects so much as one of my plants on one of my farms, I'll hold you responsible. That's right. For making him the loan. Well, without help, he'll lose everything. Or is that what you want, judd? Who are they? I don't know. Mr. Post? Yes. I'm Ellen mclean... Mrs. Mclean. And this is my son Parrish. You wrote nothing about a son, Mrs. Mclean. You don't expect him to stay here? The agency said there were separate quarters on the grounds. I hope-- I find this very difficult. It's also an imposition, Mrs. Mclean, because within the week, my daughter returns from school. Now, she's at a vulnerable age-- say, what do you think I am, some kind of a professional wolf or something? I'll await you in the library, Mrs. Mclean, but only with the distinct understanding your son cannot live here. Come on, let's clear out. You can't work for that guy. Shh. You take a walk and cool off now. It's perfectly clear you won't be able to stay with me here at first, but we'll have to wait until I can bring him around. Right now, my job is to smooth his feathers. Come in, come in, Mrs. Mclean. Please be seated. Thank you. I'm sorry about your boy, but-- oh, please don't be. I didn't realize the proximity problem. I understand you wish me to take charge of your daughter's debut after her graduation. Yes. Yes, and there will be other problems. It seems wise that-- that you know. See, I've brought Alison up here alone. Her mother was killed when Alison was an infant, so she's never really known a mother, and yet she's-- she's like her mother in many, many ways. Her mother was-- was a woman of spirit, she was beautiful, passionate, willful... And... Intensely dissatisfied with the quiet life we lead here. So dissatisfied she... She left me shortly before the smash-up that caused her death. In a sense, i'm, uh, I'm reliving this now. Alison, too, is beautiful, stormy, unpredictable, and she's defiant. This is why I need your help, Mrs. Mclean. There are things about her generation that I... Well, we simply do not understand each other. Does one generation ever completely understand the next? * well, now we're in the workday * * hey, man * I say, this is a workday * * hey, man * well, now, it's a workday * * hey, man * yes, and we're * going down the road * well, yes, this a workday * * hey, man what? [Work song continues] Hey, yoo-hoo! Ooh. Hey, baby, you're good-looking. Thank you. You busy tonight, lover? Does your mommy know you're out, baby? No, she's-- hey, don't get scared. My, they grow 'em awful tall in the city, now, don't they, loverboy? Whoo! Hey, how about helping me grow some tobacco? Now, don't be scared. He's afraid. [Laughing] Come on, sweetheart, I love blondes. Hey, you. Yes, sir? Labor office send you? No, sir, but I sure could use a job. Know tobacco? I'm looking to learn. My name's mclean. I'm donati. I manage this farm. Got your social security card? First thing to learn about tobacco, son, is this: With tobacco, you got just so much time to grow your crop and no more. You get behind, you never make it up, and it costs plenty. Right now, we're behind because of rains. So if you sign here, plan to work. Ok? Yes, sir. New man. Show him the ropes. [Tractor engine] What are you doing here, kid? Oh, I get it. Sala takes one look at you, and don't want you living almost in his daughter's lap, eh? Well, I guess it was hate at first sight. You got any idea where I can find a place to live close by? Any objections to living in a house full of women? You just been voted into the lodge. We live down the road a piece. Ain't nothing fancy, but we sure get a lot of laughs. Meet my wife's ma Mary, my wife Rosie, my wife's sister Lucy. [Tractor starts] Why don't you plant them right in the field? It's too delicate. Tobacco's like a baby. Grows inside here until it gets big enough. Then you get it out, and it's the boss. Got to keep it warm and sheltered, watered, hoed, sucker, all the time, care. It never leaves you alone, and you can't leave it alone. All the time, you work on it, worry about it, till it's grown up. Nothing but trouble. Like a baby. Parrish? Yup. It's going to work out all right. Poor Mr. Post, he-- he's not a happy man. I could have told you that blindfolded. But he's not mean, he's--he's just really unhappy. Isn't this a pretty place? Wha--now, what happened to you? You--you're all dirty. I got a job and a place to stay. Just came by to pick up my bags. Well, well, how? Where? The joke's on post. I'm working for him and living with that funny guy that picked US up at the airport. Does he live alone? Nope. He's got a kind of harem. Lives with his wife's family and his kids. They're all females. Oh, you think that's all right? [Car horn] Oh, honey, well, it's only temporary. I'm sure I have persuaded Mr. Post to let you move in here with me. What about his darling daughter? Knowing the hazards, I think you can avoid them. [Car horn] Watch out for my kid sister, boy. She's a tiger. Ha ha ha. There they are. Whee! Daddy! [Yelling] Give me a big hug. Uh, teet's and my sister's brood. Grandma takes care of them while we work. Is it too crummy? It's very picturesque. I kind of like old houses. Oh, uh, grandma, this is Parrish. He's going to live with US. He's gonna what? Where? In the attic room above mine. You'll go to hell, Lucy. Mark my words, right to the fiery place. Don't mind grandma. She's kind of nuts about sin and all that. And this is my bedroom... In case you get lost. And the thundering herd lives up and down this hall, and that's the John. Only the lock's broken, so don't be surprised at anything. Well, this is it. It ain't much, Parrish, but we could have a lot of fun together... You and me. That'll make up for a lot, won't it? You wanna know something, Lucy? This is something I've wanted for a long time, to be on my own. You know, to come and go whenever I want with no one to tell me [telephone rings] What I can do or can't do. [Ring] After supper, I'll show you the pond and the orchard. Mary: For you, Lucy! It's you-know-who. It's real private in here till August. Then they hang the tobacco up there to dry. How do they get it up there? The Jamaicans. They carry it right up to the top. I'd like to try it. On some warm nights, I sleep right there. And you know what else? No. What? When it gets too hot, I sleep raw. Do you want to kiss me? Wow. I knew it'd be like this. You sure know how to kiss. We can't do anything more about it. At least, not now, Parrish. I'm real sorry, Parrish, but you know that phone call that came a little while ago? It was this fella, see. He couldn't come last night, so I promised to save him tonight. If it was any other fella, Parrish, I'd stay here with you. This particular fella, I can't turn him down. Are--are you in love with this guy? No. I hope he doesn't come, honest. Gee, Parrish, I went ape over you the minute I saw you. Don't you know that? Mary: Lucy! Don't answer. He's here, Lucy! I gotta go, Parrish. You don't understand. I just gotta go. Parrish, I'm home. You mad at me? Lucy, something terrible has happened. I don't want you to see me. I'm sick. I'm sick. Well, let me in, honey. Maybe I could help you. Sit down. I'm sorry to come to your house and get sick like this. It's spreading like wildfire. Don't scratch it. I'll be right back. Sit down. You just got a little tobacco poisoning. It's like poison Ivy, only you only get it once. Bet you were worried. I sure was scared the first time I got it. This calamine lotion will help cool it off. Does it feel better? Mm-hmm. It feels cooler still if you blow on it. Lucy, you say you're not in love with this guy tonight? He's a cube. He makes me sick. Then why do you date him? Here. This is all yours. I shouldn't have asked you that. You're not my girl. I mean, I shouldn't pry. I'll be your girl if you want me to be. You put this on during the night. Or if you want me to put it on, just tap on the floor. I'll come up and do it for you anytime you want. * there's a wheel spinnin' on the ground * * puttin' tobacco in the ground * * there's a wheel a-spinnin' in the ground * * puttin' tobacco in the ground * * there's a wheel spinnin' around and round * * puttin' tobacco in the ground * * there's a wheel spinnin' round and round * * puttin' tobacco in the ground * * there's a wheel spinnin' round and round * * puttin' tobacco in the ground * * there's a wheel spinnin' round and round * * puttin' tobacco in the ground * * there's a wheel a-spinnin' round and round * * puttin' tobacco in the ground * * work is done and I'm going home * * work is done, my work is done * * work is done and I'm going home * good night, donati. * work is done, work is done * well, if it ain't little miss wildcat home from school. * ...And i'm going home * * work is done... Are you my watchdog? You're Alison. I'm Ellen mclean. Yes, I know. My father wrote me about you. Where is he? Well, he's out in the fields. We didn't expect you till dinnertime. Oh, put them right there, Phil. I averaged 80 most of the way. Only got one ticket. Trying to keep a date. Does my father expect you to manage me or just spy and report to headquarters? Or possibly to help you? My first hope is that we might like and understand each other. Well, then you might as well know I consider this place a living death, and no matter how hard he tries, he won't be able to ram it down my throat. But it's perfectly beautiful. And he can't hire anybody to do it. Shall we declare war, you and me? You and I. Alison. Welcome home, baby. Well, well, well. Ah, let me look at you. My goodness. Now, get down here in the light where I can really see you. You're a woman, darling. You went away a girl. You've come home a woman. This is my daughter-- yes, we've met. Uh, Mrs. Mclean has planned a real gala dinner for you. Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I'd known. Wiley called to say he's arranged a welcome-home affair at the club for me tonight. Wiley raike? W--i thought you promised not to see the raikes again, honey. You'll have to get used to pop and the raikes' feuding. He seems to think that judd raike virtually stole most of his land. [Car horn honks] Besides, his son drives a red Mercedes. I'm sorry about dinner, daddy. Don't wait up for me. It's only a phase. They all go through a stage where they seem to want to do the very thing we object to most. Maybe they're trying to fight for their own identity. I hope it's that simple. I discovered this old whaler with Lucy last Sunday. You're looking very relaxed these days. Like a man who has a woman all his own who thinks he's wonderful. Is she really all you want, this Lucy? For the first time in my life, I feel free. I don't want this urge to be free to get out of hand, Parrish. Now how far has this thing gone? You know, in releasing yourself from the bondage of me, maybe you're trading it for another kind? Everyone has a first fierce love, darling, every man, every woman. Lucy is there when you want her. She's available. Not wonderful, only available. Can't you see that? Oh, she isn't truly what you want in a woman, is she? She's free and natural and not tied down to narrow minded conventions like most people. Aw, aren't you in love with an illusion? Nobody's free, everybody's tied to somebody or something, even if it's only to his own conscience. How's yours? I suppose when a father discusses these things with his son, he tells him about some easy girl he once got mixed up with in his youth. Maybe how he got hurt. I guess he warns him to watch his step. It's a great bond between fathers and sons to share these confidences. It's difficult to share them with me, isn't it? Don't worry so much, honey. Parrish, I don't want to preach. I--i only want to keep you from making mistakes that can hurt you permanently. Look, I even realize, I think, that the Lucys of this world are a part of your learning. They can teach you that the girl who gives herself too freely can be worse than a convenience, she can become a habit. And sometimes habits are impossible to break. I'll be ok, I can handle this. All right. All right, then. Live your life in your own way, but try not to get yourself more deeply involved than you can see your way out of. Please? Doggone if I didn't know it. Last night I fortold it. That temperature didn't stop dropping, all them cursed worms we had last year in number 11 would sure come up and have a feast. Didn't I, Rosie, didn't I? Sure you did. Well, it's a-- it's bad, but... Not bad enough to go under. Let's uh, restock by hand. Mary, Rosie, Lucy, go to the feed beds and start pulling. The rest of you yank every dead and dying plant in this field. Kill the worms and replant by hand. Well, you've all seen wire worms before. You nailed down or something? Come on, let's go! Come here, kid, and I'll show you. Watch your step. First you pull the dead plant... Split the stem and kill the worm, grub in the soil for more, dig a fresh hole, pour in a cup of water, stick in a fresh plant, sure up the soil around the stem. Then we hope for the best. Well, what made the wire worm pick that particular plant for its dinner instead one of those healthy ones? Well, should I happen to hear, kid, you'll be the first to know. All who are willing to work tonight raise your hands. Aw, donati, my man don't like me to come home late, you know that. Listen, I got a heavy date I been trying to make for a solid month. I ain't giving up my fun for no worms. I got a date, too, John. One of them things. How about an extra hour? Anybody kick about working a lousy extra hour? [Crickets chirp] All we can do now is pray that it doesn't turn cold enough tonight to bring them out. Thanks, John, teet, Parrish. Teet: Night, sir. I never thought sala would've worked alongside of US on his knees like that. That's what makes him a better tobacco man than judd raike will ever be. I'm pooped. Well, let's get home. I'm gonna sleep at mother's tonight. You all put out about Lucy dating that fella? She can't help it, kind of got hooked. I didn't even see anybody. Are you all right, mister? I'm not a mister, I'm Parrish mclean, and I'm not hurt. Thank god you're not dead. That's all I need around here. I'm in the dog house enough as it is. It becomes clear why my father didn't want you living too close to me. How did you know about that? My mother tell you? Your father? You like champagne? Got some in my car left over. There's something you better learn quick, Parrish. There're no secrets in this valley, none. Even if I felt like kissing you right here and now, you can bet the whole valley know it by sunrise. Even if you only felt like it and didn't actually do it? I make a point of doing as I please. Besides, I always say if you're gonna get hell anyway, you might as well get it for doing something worth getting it for. Don't you? Mmm. Sala: Alison? Duck. Alison? Sorry to kiss and run. I guess the cold brought them up again. How many seed beds do we have left? Maybe enough to replant one more time. If it don't warm up tonight, we're dead. Donati: Well, here we go again. Get your boxes there. I knocked on your door last night, but you weren't even there. Are you mad at me because of him? No, it's just that I worked late last night, and I slept at the apartment, that's all. That ain't all. Something's different, I can tell when I came to work today. Donati: Hey, Lucy. All aboard. You work here? What are you doing? Well, those are seed beds. I'm stripping them. You're new, aren't you? Why is sala stripping all his seed beds? Is it the blue mold again? Are your folks in tobacco? My father's judd raike. Don't worry, I won't blab everything to my father. I admire sala very much. He lives on his land. Don't you? No. I wish we did. We live in Hartford. My father does all of his farming over the telephone. Which field number is it? Number 11. You know, you know an awful lot about tobacco for a kid. I'm no kid, and I study agriculture in school. And I'm the only girl in the class. Good-bye. If you decide to sell, Tom, sell it to me-- complete, everything: Trucks, fields, sheds, everything you've got. I'll buy it all. What'll you take for it? She's here. Paige? Come here. No-- did you know your cousin Tom wasn't working his broadbrook farm this year? Well, yes, sir. Well, why didn't you tell me? Give your wife the facts of life. You know father insists on knowing these things. If you decide to sell, Tom, sell to me. Now, where have you been? Bicycling. I like to have my family here when I get home from the office. Yes, father. Where were you cycling? Past our rich farm. How far past? As far as the post farm. What field are they working? Number 11. You told me sala finished planting number 11 last week. That's what lemmie said. Now you know sala's field numbers as well as our own. Why did you make that mistake? It wasn't a mistake. It wasn't a mistake? Ok, ok, stop it, stop fidgeting. Relax, put your hands down. That's it. Are they resetting number 11? Uh... Is sala in trouble? Criminy, how should I know? I just stopped to talk to this boy at the seed beds and came home. What boy? What boy? He's new. Do you make it a practice to stop and flirt with strange boys? It wasn't like that. I just repeated what you told me. No, you didn't. You put your own twist on it, and now you want me to say it was like that. Well, it wasn't. Just because Edgar and wiley yes you on everything doesn't mean I will. I wasn't flirting and neither was he. You only love people when they do what you want and agree with everything you say. Well, I don't care if you don't love me. There wasn't anything wrong in what I did, and I won't say there was. Paige, come here! You come right here. Look... Don't you know that sala's trouble can become our trouble, too? You haven't told me the whole thing, have you? Have you? Why not? What's wrong out there? When I asked Alison for a date tonight she said she couldn't cause her old man had worms in number 11. Was that it? Well, that's no crime, Paige. Anybody can get wire worms. Has he plants left? For tonight. What else did Alison say? Well, I asked her on this yachting weekend-- I mean about number 11. That's what I'm trying to tell you. She said she couldn't go out tonight because they were replanting-- why didn't you report this to me? Well, I didn't think her old man's worms mattered that much. Everything that happens in this valley matters. Everything, and don't you forget it! His number 11 can yield $10,000 worth of prime leaves, leaves that I have contracted to buy. If he loses the field then I lose the leaves. May I take my shower now, father? Yes, yes. What's the weather? Mm-hmm. Warm front on the way, but it won't get here tonight. Tomorrow, Mr. Sala post will be begging for plants. He'll be out of luck. Everybody's pulled their beds except US. Not quite everybody. Thompson. Yes, greenfield. Teet: Night. Parrish: Good night, teet. Hello. I know, I'm not supposed to be here, but I'm a specialist at doing what I'm not supposed to do, remember? Besides, I wanted to see if you were going home with that girl. Tell me about that girl. How does she compare with me? There's nothing to compare, nothing. Know why I really came down here? To see if I'd feel the same way as I did last night. Now I know. I do. Let's face it, I find myself falling in love with a field hand. What do we do about it? I want desperately for you to be able to move up here close to me. How do we work that? You go to bed and think about it, so will I. Neither one of US will sleep a wink all night long. Did you spend the night here? What's the verdict? Parrish: Bad news. Well...we lost. Harrow it under. A hot spell's coming. We can still save the field. We might save the fields, yes, if I can find the plants. Thanks for the hard try, John. Parrish... Thank you for your loyalty. I won't forget it. Oh, Parrish, you, uh, you're welcome to move in with your mother whenever you wish. Oh. Was I dreaming this morning, or did I hear papa say your son could move up here with US? Yes, he did, and I'm very grateful. Is he moving in tonight? He said he didn't want to right now. Well, why not? Well, he seemed to think it could lead to trouble of some kind. Well, that's hardly complimentary to US, is it? Well, if that's what he wants, let him stay there. I don't think he knows what he wants just yet. Well, I just realized that I do. I know what I want and what I don't want. And what I don't want is some poor boy to come along and make me love him. I want a rich one like wiley raike. Then I wouldn't care whether I loved him or not. I'll buy what I want, even a lover if I want one. Well, Alison, if there's a death warrant for happiness you've described it. I think your father must be back. Oh, uh... Good afternoon. I'm judd raike. Yes, I know. I'm Ellen mclean. I came to offer sala all the plants he needs. Well, that's very generous of you. Please, come in. Please. He's pretty desperate, I think. It seems most of the growers have turned under. Yes, I know, that's why I came. No, no, no, i--i prefer my special brand, thanks. You're new to tobacco country. I didn't even know they grew tobacco as far north as Connecticut. Oh, there's magic in the soil here. And the best soil in the valley belongs to sala. One thing we all have in common though, we're a breed of gamblers. You see, tobacco's a sensitive crop. You change a single factor and our plants change. For instance, you take away the claws from fine shade tobacco and you have coarse broad leaf. You take away nitrogen, and your plants starve. You take away three cold nights and, um, sala's number 11 would be alive and thriving today. Yes, we gamble on many factors every single day of our lives, and sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose. Did you leave out the human factor on purpose? Our biggest gamble of all. The one on which we rise or fall. I like you. Well, thank you. I like you, too. Have any luck? No. Well, I just dropped by to say that I have more than enough plants. How many do you want? None, thank you. They're yours for nothing. Is this why you bought up all len Thompson's plants last night, hmm? Did you think I'd come begging to you? I'd lose the field, the crop, and my farm first. Good afternoon. Oh, I'm so sorry. I know you came to offer help. Pride can be a terrible thing. It has two edges. It can cut both ways. If I can manage it quietly, uh, discreetly, that is, may I see you again? It would be a pleasure. Thank you. Hello, wiley? I've decided to go on that yacht weekend with you. But the only way daddy will let me go is if Ellen chaperones. Oh, I know, but I can't help it. She's ok, honest. And once we're down at the shore, I'm going to talk daddy into letting me stay. I'm fed up with this place. Ellen: Dear Parrish, along with everything else, judd raike owns this hotel or boatel as they call it. His yacht is anchored nearby, and he calls that his floating office. There's room for 100 boats... And three pools for the guests. One for swimming, one for diving, and one for the children to Wade in. Each day, Alison goes water skiing with wiley. She's as illusive as quicksilver and as beautiful. She treats him outrageously, but he remains her slave. Yesterday, I watched them from the bridge over the Connecticut river. Alison used only a single ski. I'm returning tomorrow afternoon for some clothes. P.s. Judd raike likes me. [Fireworks whistles] Worker #1: * hey, man worker #2: * I singin' through the work day * * hey, man * well now with the work day * * hey, man... * you're gonna be a tobacco man yet, son. Teet, what do you know about judd raike? Like what? What kind of a guy is he? Did you ever talk to him? Oh, sure, all the time. We play Polo regular. I mean, what have you heard, good or bad? I hear good and bad about everybody. What about him and women? Well, I hear tell he loves them and leaves them. But with all his dough, wouldn't you? What's the matter? You just heard about him and your ma? You don't know what you're talking about. Well, there ain't nothing secret in the valley, boy. And what judd raike does to who is news. What's the matter, kid? Don't this speed and kick of yours work both ways? It's ok for you but not for your ma? She's decent. Don't you want any dinner? What's the matter? You upset 'cause your ma's been carrying on with judd raike? She's not carrying on with anyone. If she sees judd raike, she's lonesome, that's all. And if she's lonesome, do you know whose fault it is? Mine. No, it ain't. Move over. It ain't nobody's fault. There's one thing you can count on-- all men and women are alike. Only we operate different, that's all. That's why men make suckers out of women. 'Cause underneath we all want the same thing. Whether we admit it or not. Unless there's something wrong with them, and there ain't nothin' wrong with your ma that judd raike can't cure. Look, shut up! She's no cheap tramp like-- like what? Like who, me? Am I suddenly a cheap tramp because I went ape over you? So she has got a yen for raike, so what? Even your precious ma ain't no Saint. You know, she can have as big a yen for somebody as I can. Damn it, is that all you can think about? No, that ain't all I ever think about, but it sure seemed like all you thought about the minute you moved in here, until miss Alison post laid eyes on you! Go ahead and say it! I'm a dumb, cheap tramp! Say it! I'm a dumb, cheap tramp! I'm sorry, Lucy. Well, darling, home to roost? I figured you might need somebody around. Like a son? Or a guardian. Everybody in the valley knows about you and judd raike going together except maybe sala. We've been very discreet, Parrish, and there's nothing wrong. I know that, but do the gossips? What happens when sala hears? I don't know. Judd needs me, too. Like a hole in the head! All he has to do is snap his fingers and women come running. I know that. He's a strong, exciting man. Who's worth $20 million? That's part of it. Why not? Don't they call that compromising? Haven't you been compromising, too? I have no right interfering, mom. It's just that I hate to see people making dirty cracks about you and him. I have to fill my life. I can't hold you any longer. I'll be alone. Not anymore. I'm moving in here tonight. Right now. I can't have you getting mixed up with a big shot who can't even meet you out in the open. Parrish, I want you to understand this. I want judd raike to ask me to marry him. Tonight, I'm meeting him on his boat. That doesn't sound very pretty, does it? Have faith in me. Alison left word. She's gone back to the farm with wylie, so I'm free tonight. Hotel desk, please. Woman: Hotel desk. If any calls come for Mrs. Mclean, she's just returned to town. Yes, sir. Let me show you below. No. You've never been below, have you? Well, this is my bedroom, and there's your sitting room. I never realized there was this much space below. Oh, it's really a lovely boat. Ellen, how long has your husband been dead? 10 years. And you've-- you've lived alone ever since? Yes. You know, I always say it isn't the things you do that you regret, but the things that you didn't do. Let's be honest, judd. There have been times when I met a man and... And been tempted. That's only natural. But always, I would stop and think twice. And then suddenly the man would seem... Ordinary, or weak, or dull... And then I'd say to myself, "oh, no. I don't want this. I would mind terribly if I settled for this." So I haven't. Have you always thought twice? Always. Oh, don't you believe me? Oh, I could have lied to you, you know. I could have asked myself, "what kind of a man is this? "A man with power who holds almost an entire valley in his hands. "Hundreds of lives. "What kind of a woman does he want? "A woman who hasn't given herself, "who after 10 years still hasn't found an answer to many things. Or does he want a woman who's known many men?" These are 2 different kinds of women, judd. Different right down to the core. I could be either woman you want, but I decided not to lie. Why not?' because I can't play games. I've never wanted another woman as I do you. Oh, don't make me think twice, darling. Now... Think twice. Because that's the only way I'd want you. [Sighs] Why did you let me? Because I don't believe in regrets. Then offer me friendship, judd... Or marriage... But not an affair. I wouldn't be very good at it. Now, what do I want with marriage? I think I'd better go home. You'll regret that. Yes, I probably will. Good-bye, judd. Good-bye. That's the longest shower I ever listened to. Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw your light on. What took you so long to make that move? Thought maybe she had you hooked. How about you and wylie raike? You know, if your father was to look this way, he'd be in for quite a shock. Well, let's take care of that, shall we? Let's stop hurting each other. Want to know the truth? The only reason I went to the beach... 'Cause you didn't move up here near me when you could have. Why didn't you? I don't know. I guess I thought it would end up just like this. Just like what? Like US always meeting in the dark, kind of behind barns. Your father trusts me. Oh... Your conscience. I had one once, then I lost it along the way. As Eve said to Adam... "Want a bite of my apple?" That's how Adam lost his conscience. [Car engine] Oh, Parrish, why do I love you so? Don't you want to? Well, it doesn't make any sense. Does it have to? No. [Car door closes] [Door opens] [Door closes] [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello? Yes, judd. Yes, I'm safely home. Yes, i-- I was upset, too. We shouldn't be listening. I--i can't hear you. I won't tell a soul. Not even Parrish. [Tractor engine] Hi, kid. How's it going, teet? Fine. Seen the morning paper? You mean about Alison's debut? I was there in a rented monkey suit. Your ma ran that right off the front page. I don't know. It seems like sala can't never win. He must be jinxed or somethin'. [The wedding march plays] There she is! Oh, darling! Good-bye, darling. Well, seems we've now got a servant for a stepmother. Sir... May I go on working for you till the harvest? If you wish, Parrish. With Alison soon back to school, it'll be lonely here, and... I'd gotten rather used to having mclean around. Teet: 4:00, kids. Knock it off. 4:00, kids. Knock it off. Ah, you can go home now, kids. 4:00. [Laughing and chattering] Was the wedding pretty? Yes. You gonna live on up here alone? Uh-huh. You going to the crew's harvest party? Sure. Aren't you? No. Nobody's asked me. Seems the word's got around that I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Course, I'm sure. I been to the doctor. Lucy... Is it mine? How dumb can you get? You could have told me. Of course, I'll marry you. You don't have to do that. But I will. Oh, you will? I am 4 months gone, and you weren't even here 4 months ago! Did you know that you are the dumbest kook on earth? Lucy, was it your secret date? Is he gonna marry you? No. He don't come around any more. Rosie says she'll help me raise my baby right along with hers. Oh, Parrish, I get so lonesome. Lucy, will you be my date for the harvest party? All right. You won't even have to kiss me or anything. [Car door closes] I thought I'd never shake wylie. Did you think I'd never come? This is the plan for tomorrow night. I've got compartment e, car 12. So, you just go down to the train early, go in, and lock the door. Wait for me to knock 3 times. I'll say good-bye to papa at the steps. Then we'll have all that time, all the way to Albany, to be alone. You can come home on the midnight train. Isn't it perfect? It is, but I can't go. I'm taking Lucy to the harvest party. Lucy? You mean that tramp down the road? Oh, Parrish, you just can't do that! Darling, it doesn't mean anything. Well, the whole valley knows what condition she's in. People will think that you did it. People! People make me sick! If a mangy dog comes along and they fuss over it, it's all right. But if a person needs a little bit of kindness, that's no good. That's immoral. That's a disgrace to the great world we live in. If you really love me, don't take her. It's got nothing to do with me loving you. Parrish... This'll be our last night together until next summer. I'm asking you not to take her. Are you going to? Yes. I hate you more than I thought it was possible to hate anything or anyone on earth! They're here! [Doorbell rings] Well, can't we all sing "happy homecoming" or something? We're going to put her in her place right off. Welcome home, Mrs. Raike. Thank you, maples. Welcome home. Oh, Paige, thank you. What a pleasure it is to see you. Evaline, you look so pretty. Wylie. I look forward to getting to know my new family now. Shall we call you "ma" or "Mrs."? Wouldn't "Ellen" be easier? Where may I ask is our father? Oh, he wanted to take a drive around the properties before coming home. You all remember Parrish. Your father thought it would be nice if Parrish moved in with US, for the first month at least, so we could all get to know each other. I guess I'll freshen up a bit before judd gets here. Oh, please let me show you your rooms. [Snap] You. Will you leave US alone, please? You, uh, hear from Alison this winter? I received a card from her at Christmas. If you're going to be living under our roof, mclean, I'd best make a few things clear. You're going to be more careful about what you do... And who you're seen with. There was a lot of talk about you in the valley last summer. We don't any more of it. I'll do what I want, and I'll see who I want. Not while you're in this house, you don't. We raikes have a position to maintain in this valley, and as long as you stay here, you'll behave like a raike. And that goes for that woman, too. Don't see her again. Woman? What woman? The field hand you lived with last summer. They're saying her baby's yours. Whoever they are, they're lying. And get this straight... If I want to see my friends, I'll see them. I'll see who I please when I please and where I please. And another thing... The next time my mother offers to shake hands with you, you shake hands. I'm delighted you're staying with US, Parrish. May I show you your room? Thanks, but I'd like to see my mother first. Well, she's down there. [Knock on door] Come in! Darling, isn't this beautiful? Judd is so thoughtful. He had it all redecorated in my favorite colors. And wait'll you see this... That is my new car! And tonight he's invited the most important people in the valley to meet US. To meet you, not me. Tonight's terribly important to me. Please? Do I have to wear a monkey suit? You'll have to go rent one. Come on. Go and find it in my brand new car. And afterwards, take a nice long ride and cool off, please. [TV plays western movie] Oh! Dear lord... Come in. Come on. [Gunshots on TV] Look who's here! [Yells] Look who's here! Hi, Parrish! Hi! What you doin' here? [All talk at once] I just rented my monkey suit. We're celebrating our new furniture, lover boy! Ain't it gorgeous? Hey! Help US baptize our new refrigerator. Now, ain't that something? It's a beauty! Upstairs and downstairs, the whole joint's like this. So new, you can't spit nowhere! What did you win, the Irish sweepstakes? All came with Lucy's little brat. Do you want to see him? Yes. We got a new chair, we got a crib... We've redone everything in the house but your room. I go up there and sit sometimes. Come on. Shoot, man, we got everything. Ha ha ha! I'm always great to the little mutt. Lucy: You think he looks like me? Looks more like his crummy father, don't he, Parrish? I wouldn't know, teet. Well, look at that hair, look at that chin... Now don't he look like somebody you know? Huh? A raike maybe? Shut up, blabbermouth! I'm sorry, Lucy. I didn't even know you knew wylie. I don't. The only raike I know is Edgar. Ah, the weldons. Alice... How are you? Good evening. Ellen, may I present Mr. and Mrs. weldon? How do you do? Welcome to the tobacco clan Mrs. Raike. Thank you. Than which there's nobody clannier. Oh, I know. I learned that when I worked for Mr. Post. Your mind's not on your work, mister. Isn't Edgar even going to show up? Mr. and Mrs. weldon, may I present Parrish mclean? Wow, Paige! If he lived under my roof, I couldn't sleep nights. Can you? Well, tonight I'll find out, maizie. Sala tells me you have the makings a real tobaccoman, Parrish. Well, I hope someday to be 1/1oth as good as he is, sir. Tom, what do you think of the new addition to our household staff? Who? Sala's ex-maid. Ellen, I think father calls her. I think she's utterly charming, honest, and a lady. I hope she'll honor US by being our friend. You're kidding? With Edgar, it's absolutely essential you ignore him. He's a fool! Cover for me, Paige. This won't wait. Don't let mother know. Come on with me. For what? You're gonna make an announcement. A public announcement. What do you mean make a public announcement? Of what? When I talk to you, listen, hoodlum. Don't hoodlum me. I know what the score is. I dropped by Lucy's this afternoon. We'd better have a little talk before you go in there and announce it over the loudspeaker. Announce what? The birth of your firstborn child. No wonder you ordered me not to see Lucy. You know, this might even teach you to stop ordering me around. How 'bout it? You gonna go in there and tell them? Is that why you kept it so secret? You thought it would make a nice homecoming surprise for your father. Come on. Or do you want me to go in and break the happy news for you? You wouldn't dare. They'd think it was yours and that you were only trying to get out from under. Yeah, they might. Let's go find out. Do you think that our friends would take the word of a field hand against mine? Let's go see. While you're at the microphone, you can explain that it wasn't really being rotten using Lucy because you're a raike, and it's all right to father a raike child who is a raike and looks like a raike, but who never really will be a raike because of all your very special raike rules, and everybody will cheer. Come on. Let's do it. You're trying to blackmail me, huh? I never thought about it, but why not? Look, Parrish, what's the good? Letting this out and spoiling our good name. After all, you're one of US now. What do you want of me? I want you to swear before god that at home and in public from now on, you treat my mother like the lady she is. What else? I want you to go to that microphone and welcome her into your family. What else? That's all. * and my secret love's no secret * * anymore [applause] * * * * ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Edgar raike. Friends... I have an announcement. As you all know, we raikes have a great pride in our valley and in our home and a great pride in our father, but we have never been prouder of him than tonight when he brought home his lovely... His gracious bride to make our home complete. My mother sent me that "say thank you" look. We want to thank Paige and evaline and wiley and particularly Edgar for making US feel so welcome here today and to father raike for having a heart big enough to hold US all. [Applause] [Music plays] Son... Now, you be in my office at 9 A.M. tomorrow morning. Got to get you started. Thank you, sir. Do you mind, dear? Hello, darling. Long time, no see. I missed you. I thought you were mad at me. Not since I heard judd raike tell me he was going to give you the chance to go right to the top. I graduate in June. Mind if I come along for the ride? If it's worth the beating. You can take quite a beating for $20 million, darling, and if you get too black and blue, I could kiss you where it hurts every night. Would you like that? Shall we not kid ourselves, sis? [Traffic sounds] [Buzz] Yes? Parrish mclean to see you, sir. Oh, good. Show him in. Good luck. Thank you. Now, let's start where it all starts, son: The land. Now, this "r" insignia means that raike properties control more land and more dollars and more people than any other firm in the valley. Even more than sala post did in his prime. Now, there's only one gap in my territory. Right here. Oermeyer, Tully, sala post. I don't like it. It's not practical, and I mean to close it. Now, watch this and watch closely. Now, this filler comes from my fields in Puerto Rico. And this binder comes from my fields in Pennsylvania. But this... Light and perfect-shaped leaf... The wrapper... Comes from right there. And if you decide to let me teach you this whole operation, you'll devote your life to seeing that those leaves grow to absolute perfection. Now, you'll get to know every inch of my fields and beds and sheds and warehouses. You'll know the names and numbers and strengths and weaknesses of every human being that belongs to US. And in order for you to acquire this knowledge, I'll start you out as my checker. You'll have a roadster of your own, and I'll pay you $125 a week to start. How's that? You don't need to do this just because you married my mother. I know that. And you might as well know this right now: I'll be the toughest boss you've ever met in your life. I'll expect more from you than I do my own sons. You'll have to check every field I control every day without any time for horsing around with the workers. They'll be no time flirting with those... Fillies in the sheds. This is no routine 9 to 5 performance with time out for coffee and cigarettes and dames and hangovers. I'm offering you a man's job. Do you think you can handle it? Yes, sir. Good. Send Mr. Gilliam in. Meet Mr. Gilliam, son. Now, he'll show you the farms, introduce you to the foreman, and then he'll show you the time book methods. Now, check everything. Keep your eyes open. If you don't understand anything, ask about it. I want you to report to me here every night. I want to know where you were and what you saw when you got there. If you have any trouble or any problems, you let me know about that. Got it? Got it. Thank you, sir. Order a car for him. What colors do you like? R-Red and white. You heard the man. Red and white. Make it a convertible so he can take his girl out on nights off. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Order my car for inspection of the warehouses, and then call my New York office and tell them I was expecting a complete financial report on my desk this morning... All right. Where did you go today? Don't you know where you went unless you read it out of a book? I think I know where-- not good enough. Around here, we don't think! We know. We're 100% sure. Now take it off the map. We went to these first. Point out the ones we lease and the ones we own outright. I don't know. You don't know? Didn't you ask? I thought you owned them all. I didn't think. You didn't think?! Well... That sums it up, doesn't it? Didn't I tell you this morning that I wanted to know where you went and what you saw when you got there? To ask questions? Yes, sir. Didn't think. Consider yourself lucky for getting a second chance. When I was your age, nobody showed me that charity. I made one mistake, and I was out. So I stopped making mistakes. And I don't make mistakes today. See that you don't. Yes, sir. Tell your mother I won't be home till midnight. I'm finding that my brilliant sons handled things while I was away like mongoloid idiots. Parrish? Yes. Well, how did the first day go? Lousy. You think you can handle it? The job, yes. Raike, no. But he can't make me holler quits. He expects perfection. He'll get it. You know, there's only one way to handle judd. Which is? Don't argue with him when he's angry. Better still, don't argue with him at any time. Just hold your tongue. Is that how you get along with him so well? Darling, you've got to learn this: When he's calm... He's the most reasonable, thoughtful, and intelligent man I know, but when he's upset, well, he's impossible. Even though I know he loves me very deeply, he'll even shout at me sometimes, but he doesn't mean anything by it. I'm not good at being shouted at. He's not shouting at you or me. When he's upset, he snaps at whoever is handy. And when it's over, he's fine and usually quite gentle to make up for it. It's good for him to have me because I understand it. If he ever yells at you while I'm there, I'll paste him. Do you think he's the only man who's ever shouted at his wife because he was angry about something else, maybe even himself? Darling, try to remember this: He's a brilliant man who's built up a great enterprise and immense holdings single-handed. And they're his, not yours. He has a right to expect you to do things his way. Someday somebody besides judd will have to know enough to run raike properties. It won't be Edgar, and it certainly won't be wiley. I'm hoping it'll be you. But you'll have to feel-- really feel that it's worth it. And you're not afraid of this guy? He's not a guy, Parrish. He's my husband. I chose to marry him. I know his faults, but I also know his strengths. It's you I worry about, not him. Stop worrying, honey. For you, I can take anything he dishes out. You know, Paige comes home every weekend just to see you. Why don't you take her to a movie or something? Paige is just a schoolkid. She's only 3 years younger than you. But she seems more like a sister than a girl. Alison's got what it takes. Last summer, you thought that about Lucy. Alison's different. That different? [Bell rings] Have my sons and Parrish in this room in one minute, or they'll be docked a week's salary. Yes, sir. Won't it wait till after church? No, it won't, and don't you give me any trouble. Your son has done well enough of that. Better hurry. What happened? Get in there. Blue mold... Oermeyer's field... Next to lemmie's number 6. You're late and out one week's salary. Now...why didn't you report this to me yesterday? Or did you simply forget? Nobody was even working lemmie's number 6 field yesterday, and he didn't report any blue mold. Well, what if he didn't? Haven't you got eyes in your head? I don't even know what blue mold is. What is blue mold, judd? You stay out of this. Even Paige knows what blue mold is. Will you please tell this ignoramus? I-It's a type of fungus that looks like mildew and may seal spots on the leaves. And a spotted shade leaf is worthless. You! You put that bottle down. I've got a farm rotten with blue mold, and here stands a man who saw it and either wasn't interested enough to ask what it was or he wasn't even there yesterday. I'm beginning to think you're not making half your rounds. I make my rounds, and I didn't see any trouble at lemmie's yesterday, and neither did he, or he would have reported it. Let's get out there. You... You follow US. Blue mold hit you, too, oermeyer? Yes. How many fields? 3. Get Max on the phone. Tell him oermeyer's hit bottom. Offer him 2,500 an acre today. He'll sell. Now do you know what blue mold looks like? Yes, sir. It's dangerous your not knowing these things. On your job, you ought to know everything there is to know. Sir, I'm trying to learn. Start studying after work. Go to the experimental laboratory and get their handbooks and learn them by heart. Do you know that there are 2 dozen diseases and a dozen insects that can ruin a crop? You find out what they are and learn them like the back of your hand. Lemmie! Yes, sir. Parrish says he was here yesterday. Was he? Yes, sir. He was here. What about this field? Never mind. Come here. Now, if we caught mold from oermeyer, it's cheap at half the price. You just plow under and then spray the beds. Report to me in the morning. Yes, sir. Sir... Don't you ever imply that I'm a liar again. I'll call you what I please where I please and when I please. Drive by the office. He thinks he owns everybody. He'll never own me, I swear to god. Parrish... Since you've committed yourself to judd raike, this might help you. Now, this test tube is man, you might say, or you, born into a world of hurricane pressures on trembling legs. Somehow he must gain the strength to stand. Now, he can do this in 2 ways: Either slowly, painfully, while taking the infinity of blows life has to offer, he can strengthen his own muscles and draw strength from his own spirit... Or... He can weather the storm by holding onto a pole. But if he does that, see, he can never get further away from that pole than he can reach back and grab it, or else... [Clank] Most men have a pole they lean on, Parrish, even the great old mighty judd raike. What's his pole? Power, money. He needs his power over people. He must own them and manipulate them to feel his own strength. There are many kinds of Poles, Parrish, without which some men would collapse. Tell me some other kinds. With some men, it's a woman. Many women, it's a man. Could be prestige... Public opinion, popularity, religion, even... Ancestor worship... Which I suppose it is with me in a way. I don't think that's your pole. I think it's this farm. Let's go back to this first man, Parrish, the man who didn't lean on any pole. That man is the free man, and you used to worry about him. Even judd raike couldn't hurt him. Now, here's something that could... We saw over in the experimental station. It's, uh, it's called fleck. Watch out for it, Parrish. Probably comes from smog. It seems ironic, your willing to help me help your worst enemy. I'm not interested in helping judd raike, no. Maybe I can help you stand alone. Get me the new sala post contracts. He sent them back to Mr. Edgar unsigned, Mr. Raike. He sent... Get Edgar in here! Yes, sir. Your father wants you, Mr. Edgar. So this is the way it went: Right after you left on your honeymoon, I went to check number 2 warehouse. They were unpacking sala's leaves. I checked them, and I found them overdamp. You ask me, it's his crazy way of getting even with you. Boy, I sure told him off. And what did he say? He said he was having the whole crop shipped back to him at his own expense. And what did you say? I told him I was already taking care of his mistakes. And then he hung up on you. How'd you know? I don't waste my time talking to idiots over telephones either. Now, we all know that neither John donati nor sala post would ever pack a leaf too wet. They've never shipped US anything but a perfect crop, perfect leaves, so what does that make you? But they felt wet. It makes you either a liar! Or a fool... Or both. Because this season, sala post has just canceled out on US. At $3,000 an acre, that's $600,000 of the finest tobacco in Connecticut that we have just lost... Due to your fantastic stupidity. Well, that convinces me. I'm sending you where I should have started you and your nitwit brother in the first place: Where it counts, the fields. Well, what about evaline? You'll both move to oermeyer's farm tomorrow. Well, what am I gonna say to my friends? Look, i--i don't-- just say anything j-- please get out of my sight. I've always dreamed we could have a home of our own. Well, I think it's beautiful. [Hammering] Yes, take a good look at it. Just to remind you raikes every day of the year, you may have outlasted Todd oermeyer, but you'll never outlast me. We tullys was around before the name raike was even invented. You take that sign down, or I'll chop it down. Just try, Edgar, and I'll fill your rump with buckshots. Now, don't ask me how, Edgar. I'm dumping this right in your lap. And this is your last chance. Get him off that land. Get rid of Tully! All your farms worked today? Just a half a dozen until noon because of the heat. The drought's hit them all. Sir, what with things going so slow and all, it just so happens that Alison is graduating this weekend and wondered if I could be her date. Since I haven't had any time off in two months, I was wondering if-- yes, sir. You want to take this weekend off? Are you interested in learning tobacco or not? Yes, sir, I want to learn tobacco. How do you propose to go about it, or do you consider you know it all already? What would you suggest? Stop wasting your time watching the girls walk through Daisy rings. On the spot, that's where you learn tobacco. You feel it, you see it, you develop a sixth sense by being there at all times, under all conditions. Now, we're going through a hot spell right now. What if we have to irrigate this weekend? Do you know all there is about irrigation? Why not? I don't know anything about irrigation. Sala didn't have to irrigate last summer. Is that an excuse? Why, you should be able to go out on any one of my farms and tell me whether that land ought to irrigate. Do you know how much it costs to irrigate 1 acre of tobacco with 1 inch of water? I didn't think you did. No, sir. Well, irrigation is expensive. But anything that ought to be done and isn't done is more expensive still. Now, you remember that. I don't want a single day to go by that you don't learn something new. Look... You think I'm tough, don't you? Well, I am. But you've got to be tough to survive. You see, I run a big business that I built on being tough. And by all that's holy, I'm not going to let anybody wreck it, including my own flesh and blood. Now, it just so happens suculoo is irrigating his highest field tonight. What time? That's what I'm talking about! You're asking me what time. Well, I'm not the timekeeper, you are. You find out. What time? Look, one more thing. And this order stands for the entire summer. If anyone irrigates, you be there. If they irrigate nights, you work nights. I want you to learn why, I want you to learn when. Yes, sir. Look, son... Son, I don't want you caught in an emergency floundering around in front of-- in front of the whole crew not knowing what to do. And if you can't buy that, well, then... Then I guess i'm wasting my time on you. Yes, sir. And Alison's been raised around tobacco, so don't worry about her. She'll understand. And don't worry about her not having a date for graduation. I'll have--I'll have Willis drive up. Thank you, sir. Thank you very, very much. Judd: You're watching the makings of a real tobacco man walk by your desk. 2 inches, 66,000 gallons. Are you going to make the rounds of all raike's farms this hour of the night? That's right. The big man expects a complete report by 7 A.M. You better take a short snooze in the car, or the only report he'll get will be from the coroner's office. [Sirens] Where's your pump, Mr. Tully? Pump? Let it burn. I need my water worse than I need that barn. Get your hoses hooked up. The fire is a threat to raike property, can't you see that? Not with my water. You order your men to start pumping water, or you'll answer to my father personally. Tully's pond is his life. You gone crazy? There's not one of you who won't have to answer to judd raike if you don't get moving. Come on, let's go! Don't you touch my water! My--my glasses. They're draining my pond. They're draining my pond. Man: The pond's dry! So the Tully side comes tumbling down. Is that the plan? You got a little mixed up tonight, didn't you, sticking up for Tully against my father in front of all those witnesses? Mixed up, no. It's all absolutely clear. You'll be a long time talking your way out of this one, bright boy. My father never forgives a man for forgetting who he works for. Say, would you like to make a little bet on where you'll stand after tonight? I know exactly where I'll stand, and I'll be telling him myself. [Knock knock knock] [Knock knock knock] Tully was destroyed tonight. Edgar called. Sit down. I thought I finally didn't care what you said or did or how you did it. I thought you couldn't make me care if I wouldn't let you. But I was wrong. I do care. I care when you drive decent men from their own land. I care when you fight dirty or lower than anybody else, even if you do use rats like Edgar so you don't dirty your own hands. All you have to do is figure out how to live with yourself. Why, you young pup. You just had a man's job in a man's world, but you couldn't grow up to fit it. Why, I taught you lessons you ought to thank me for. They were hard lessons, but you couldn't take them. You still haven't learned that the hard way is the easiest way there is, have you? Huh, have you? Ok, go on, quit. Go on, get out. Give the other fellow all the breaks and see how far you'll get. You and your crummy ideas, why, you'll hang with them. Maybe I will hang-- get out. But if I do, it'll be for what I believe in, not you. You've spoiled everything. There comes a time when you realize if you close your eyes just once too often to what's right and decent, you'll never open them again. You'll be lost, dead. Please, honey, try and see it my way. Give me a little more time. What for? To prove what I can do without him. And what am I supposed to do in the meantime, live with you in some tobacco shack? I'm just asking you to have faith in me, that I can build a life for both of US. You can have your faith. As of now, I'm living for me and getting what I want. I'm not interested in nobility or sacrifices or any of that junk. All my life, I've been fed ideals instead of fun. Please, honey, wait just a little longer. No! Not one day, not one minute. If wylie raike wants me, he can have me, and I just bet he does. You want to stick around and find out? Mr. Wylie raike, please. Hello, wylie? I'm sorry that I woke you. Could you come over? [Door closes] Yes, I'm alone. Bye. Bye. So long. I'm sure they'll be very happy, sala. For the first time in my life, I feel sorry for a raike. She's coming. Happy birthday. Oh, it's beautiful. Surprise! Surprise! Happy birthday, darling. Thank you. * Paige has a birthday, I'm so glad * * hope it's the happiest birthday Paige ever had * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18! Now I'm a woman! Ha ha ha ha. Where's Ellen? Having her hair done. At the risk of seeming facetious, Paige, uh, who do you know in the north pole, Santa claus? Give it to me, wylie. Let's see it. Have you been secretly corresponding with Parrish in spite of my orders? May I have my letter, please? Answer my question. Yes. I have for over 2 years but not secretly. His letters come here. And it's just my bad luck you finally saw one. Now... Do I have to beg for it? I hate to even see a dog made to sit up and beg. If you're going to give him something, give it to him! But I don't think dogs or people should have to beg. And if I were a dog and somebody made me, I think I'd bite or froth at the mouth or something. Paige's voice: So he locked me in my room for a month, as if I were still a child. Oh, how I miss you. When you finish your hitch, come straight, straight home. Paige. Well, Parrish. Come on in. Come in. Come in. Well, I missed you. Yes, come on in here. Let me--let me take a good look at you. Stand right up there now. Well, you left your boyhood behind you, hmm? Yes, sir, one night under the ice at the north pole. It separated the men from the boys. I'll bet your mother saw the change. I haven't seen her yet, sir. I dropped by the house, but it was all closed up. I grabbed a bus to see you. Mm-hmm. She's down-- they're all down at the shore. Sit down. Sit down, Parrish. I had an easter greeting from Alison. How is she? Well, she looks like the rest of them now-- expensive, aimless, discontented. She could of had a real man. She settled for half. Well, what now? I want to come back here with you, not with him. I'll do anything. I want this to be my life. Well, I'd hire you in a minute, Parrish, but, uh... I'm not working the farm anymore. Did judd raike close in on you? No, but, uh, he got Tully's farm. I'm--I'm completely surrounded now. I--i suppose he figures to get my place one day just by waiting through Alison. No, i--i--i don't know what happened. I just didn't feel like working it anymore. The, uh, the cloth, the fertilizer, and the chemicals, they're all there in the shed. Suddenly, I didn't want to start another year. It's hard to picture a sala post farm without a crop. Well, I have enough to live on, Parrish. Obviously, Alison doesn't need my help anymore. I just didn't want strangers working it. What do you do now, Parrish? You stay in the valley? I don't know. I've been thinking so many months about working for you that I haven't given it much thought. What's happened to your people? Well, they scattered pretty much, all except, uh, John donati. He still lives in the cottage, but he works for Tom weldon. What about teet and his family? Well, he said he couldn't stomach working for judd raike. The last I heard, teet moved the whole family to northern Massachusetts. Are they still in tobacco? Oh, sure. Sure, once tobacco's in your blood, there isn't much you-- but think it over, Parrish. Think it over very carefully before you make your final choice. Think of all the uncertainties, the 10-to-1 odds against you. If the worms don't get you, the fungus will. It may rain all spring only to change into drought. You watch your leaves turn brown, wilt on their stalks. You fight to save them by irrigating, only to have a hail storm come along, wipe you out completely. Think of all those things. I have, sir. May I call mother at the shore? Why, sure. Go ahead. Parrish, why don't you take, uh, why don't you take the station wagon? Give your mother my best. Long distance. One more to go. Alison: Stop! Ohh! [Wylie and Alison yelling] You filthy pushover! Oh, shut up! Stop it! Stop it! Oh, shut up! Stop it! Stop it, do you hear! Stop it this minute! Everybody can hear you. Will you try to remember where you are? Now, what's all this about? She's--she's sunk to the level of pushing buttons for bellhops. What right have you walking in here and screaming like a maniac? What brought you upstairs anyway? I thought you were married to that bar down there! Alison, be quiet. I sent for the bellboy. Are you the boy they sent to adjust my air conditioning? Yes, ma'am. Well, you've got the wrong room. This is the wrong Mrs. Raike. My room is at the other end of the hall. Now, will you please go and attend to it? Yes, ma'am. You're still a common, garden variety tramp. Well, Parrish, welcome home. What will happen between her and wylie now? Nothing. They'll go on just as before, hating each other in private, but courteous and even affectionate in public. Do you think wylie believed you? Probably not. Where's Paige? She's waiting for you at the pool. Aren't you going to kiss me hello? You mean, right in front of everybody? Well, how was Alison? Fine. Pretty as ever. Judd raike offer you a job? Yeah. What was your answer? The one word he can't take--no. But, uh, you still want to be a tobacco man, huh? Yes, sir. Well, then, I'll, uh, I'll make you a proposition. Do you have $1.00? That's just, uh, to keep it legal. Parrish... I've just leased you 20 acres of my best land, on one condition-- if you can rent a crew. There's a feeling around the valley that I quit because judd raike was destined to get all this in the end, that any independents around raike were doomed to bad luck. But it's not luck. We know that, they don't. See, the apt to shy away from working for a new boy. It's important to them they work a farm that'll finish a season. Well, I will finish. All right, now, you can have the rooms there over the garage, and you can live with your crop. This isn't as one-sided as you think, Parrish. I hate to look out over empty fields. Where's the rest of your crew? I'm it. Everybody's afraid your father will swallow me up before the season's over and they'll be boycotted. They've built a wall of fear around sala's place. How do I break it down? I do know how you can have a full crew working for you by tomorrow. How? If you'll contract your whole crop to my father, he'll guarantee you a crew. He'll do anything to get a lease from here again. He'll even pay you a premium in advance. He--he sent me to tell you. I'd like to think there's something he can't buy. If he pays more, he gets it back, one way or another. With him, you get nothing for nothing. Tell him I'm selling someplace else. I'm glad you said no. I told him you would. I'm so proud that you did. Somehow, somewhere, I'll find somebody that'll work with me, even if it's somebody that nobody else will take. I've got to show the old-timers the jinx doesn't work. I know you will. [Singing] The girls league of valley high. They can only work weekends, but they're all born and raised around tobacco. And they can sew cloth, and they can cultivate. And you can expect more of their boyfriends coming any minute. O.k., here we go. Hold it! Hold it! [Singing] Well, it's a start, Parrish, but you can't run a farm with just children on weekends. You ought to know that. We spend one weekend in New York, and Edgar tells me that you end up working for sala post. For Parrish mclean. I just delivered the last of his crew safely home, and I drove the bus. It's strictly amateur night in Dixie out there. Paige rounded up a lot of high school no-nothings this weekend. Why didn't somebody call me about this? It's a flash in the pan. Those kids will be back in school tomorrow, and Parrish will be alone again. He has no help left at all? Uh-uh. I had the word passed that any raike employee who works for Parrish mclean is finished in the valley. Is raike and company so weak that you're afraid of my son and 20 acres of land? The danger must be beyond belief if you have to threaten the workers with boycott for helping him. No, you're forgetting that I offered your precious son an entire crew. Out of decency... Or because you wanted a foothold on sala's land? I've blinded myself to your cruelty as long as I can, judd. I just cannot keep silent anymore. Now, wait a minute. Excuse me. Parrish, come up to the house at once. What was that for? I want you to repeat to him what you just said to me. But that's not his business. It soon will be. Come on in here, Parrish. Now, Edgar came here tonight to blackmail me, and I'd like a witness. Now repeat to him what you just said. You don't want to, hmm? Then, Parrish, I want you to witness this. It is my hope to sell to you, Parrish mclean, the sala post farm. You can buy it out of earnings. Those earnings will go into a trust fund for Alison, so... If she ever does come to her senses, she can walk out on this raike tribe and live like a decent human being. Is such a plan agreeable to you? Yes, sir, but I don't-- Edgar has a list of Alison's indiscretions. Well, I'll get it from him. No, no, no, no, no, no. They're in my office safe. Now, Edgar... Go on home, hmm? And tell your father not to let you on my place anymore. And close the door. He'll never use that list. You know that. But he might use a torch. They've got to destroy US now. [Car horn honks] I finally found them at greenfield. All I had to do was tell them how it was with you, and now look. Criminy, think if a man had work, he'd look up his old friends. Gladstone's on his way, too. I've got to warn you, everyone's scared to take a chance with me. Ha. Tonight I told everybody, "sometimes a young bull can rip the guts out of the old bull." How many do you want, Parrish? We'll get 'em for you. * there's a man goin' around * * taking names * there's a man goin' around... * you quit lemmie to work here? What do you want to know for? I thought you were in greenfield. I was. What are you writing down there? Just who's working where. Gone back to Parrish, have you? What are you starting, some kind of a blacklist? We got a right to work where we please. Except on raike properties for as long as you live. Is that what happened at Tully's? Now, hear this: If I ever catch you within 10 feet of my fence again, I'll come over after you and knock your brains out. Look out, Parrish! I'll get you! Oh, no, you won't, because I know all your tricks and his, too, and if anything happens here, I'll know exactly who did it. Judd: Sit down. It's time my son learned to fight his own battles. Look. We've had no blue mold here... No worms... No sickness, no blight, or any other stinking thing you can think of. No fires like you pulled on Tully. So don't start thinking you can fire my cloths or burn my sheds, because I'll get you for it. If I have to, if it's the last thing I do, I'll see you burn in hell and the whole raike empire with you. Now, get out! I'm sorry...Father. So am I. [Car starts] Yeah, so am I. Loverboy, you kill me! Ha ha... I think he'll win now, don't you? He has already.
