THE LAST STAND Episode Three - Hey, tiller, you didn't fall asleep there, did you? He's definitely asleep. Oh, you... You squirm here, squirm, and he sleeps in the tank. - Bad, but it works. Happened. Changed something... - To hell with the details! Connect with headquarters. Why did he close the hatch? - Ah? - Luke, I say, why did you close it? So the conversation will be confidential. Not for your ears. Too many dangerous spies have grown up in the guise of ordinary peasants. - You yourself are a spy. - And it turns out, you opened me. So I'll have to... that. - Fool! Come on, come on. - The main thing is the bridge! Don't let it explode. Guard the bridge, otherwise our retreating units will fall... - Crap! Runge, fix the radio. - It's not with us, it's their connection that broke. Welcome! - Welcome! - Welcome, girl. - I hear you. Who else is in touch with? - With the city committee. - Thank you. Tries to connect with the city committee. - Why do I need a mountain? - Probably, only he now can answer. - Okay, come on. - Gordeladze at the apparatus. Who? Which Platov? It's a secret tank! Listen to my order. The tank must be saved! This is the main thing! - I have an order from the commander to guard the bridge. - Yes, I don't care about the bridge! And spit on the order of the commander! Hello! Hello, Platov! Platov! - Come on, Comrade Rumpel, go with the sailor to the other side. Everything from there to here. Weapons, grenades, machine guns, tape to them. Forward! We are preparing a long-term defence. - Let's do it nicely, Commander. Leave the forces on the Germans. - Enough for them. - Thinking about what? - They started shooting right at the wedding. - What do you think, they will feed us marzipans? Mother is there... - And the bride? - Aleska... - Kolya! - Good afternoon, girl. And kiss? And kiss the saviour, eh? Stop, pig! A German soldier brought you freedom. You must earn forgiveness! - Get up. Get up, come on. Get up! Go. Run come on! You also need to run. He will wake up now. - Won't wake up. Where is Kolya? - He locked me up. - And you? - And he ran to the bridge, there was a military man there, and the tank broke down. - He is there. I raised my son, though without a father, but as a peasant. Since there is a war, there will be no hiding. I locked you here because I wanted to protect you. Run girl. - I'll run to him. I love him, I want to be with him. Is always. And now I want. - So, you will, my daughter, you will. You run the garden, not the street. And there you turn into the forest and there along the stream, it will be safer. Run! Run. And kiss Kolya for me. Run girl, run. And I'll help you here. - Russian pig! I don't forgive that! Ugh! - My son grew up without a father, so I am for him for two: both a nurse and a protector. - Witch! - I'll kill you, maybe then it will be easier for my Kolka. - Go-go! Forward! - Kurt, did you shoot? - I'm sorry, son. Your wedding was bad, but your wife is good. Live, children, happily ever after! - What, tired? - I don't know. Something on the soul somehow became hard. - Do you think about the bride? - Yes. Think. - Now is definitely not the time to get married. - So, it's not too early to die in battle, but it's too early to get married, right? - The war has begun. Marrying now is irresponsible. Do you know such a word? If you die, you'll kill her too. And she is a widow for life. Young, beautiful... ...and no one wants. No love, no children. What will life be like for her? Do you love her? - I love her. - Then leave her, don't ruin her life. Come back alive, then you'll get married. - Aleska... Alesya, Alesenka... Get out of here. - I'm with you. - Alesya, go away, the Germans will be here soon. - No, I'm not leaving. Why should I live if you don't exist? I love you. - But I don't love you, Alesya. - What? - What I heard. You're saying that on purpose to get me to leave. - I do not love you. Go away! I never loved and never will, do you hear? All clear? What are you after me? I don't need you. - Survived... We've arrived. Purpose Phew... intact. Target, target. - Can you help? - No, you are our engineer, you shoot. - You're a marauder. - No, I'm just wondering what kind of people they are. Why did they come to us and stay here? Why didn't they sit at home? Oh! Why didn't you sit at home? Oh what I have! - What is it, a card? - After the war will be with me. But now she's mine. And will stay with me forever. - Well, first of all, you will be killed. And I will return as a hero. I'm already handsome, and with orders - the girls will generally tear apart. Well, secondly... These cards are not just given away. - Give it to me! - Mm! Mm! - He said, give it here. - Opa! What? - Do you understand? - What are you going to do to me? - No, you don't understand? I say give it here. Give it here, I said! - I'll tie you in a knot, tiller! - And who is this? - The actress is a friend. I carry it with me so that the crew would envy. What is it to you? - Six or seven kilometres. In an hour they might be here, but by nightfall, then, in the city? - But this is if they break through. We also have a tank. Is he even good? - You'll see. Good. - So good that he will stop all the Germans? - They won't stop everyone, but they won't pass the bridge. - Look, Rumpel, I believe you. Because in the city of Anya. And in a good way, the bridge needs to be blown up. Oh, sorry, no explosives. - Kolya... Kolya! - Alesya! Aleska! Alesya! Alesechka... Aleska, don't, I beg you! Alesya, I love you, Alesya! I love you Alesia... - And don't lie any more that you don't love me. - Alive, alive! Are you hurt? Show me where, Alesya. - I'm not hurt. I fell on purpose so that he wouldn't hit me. He doesn't know how to shoot. - Yeah, well... well, I didn't know. - Aleska. - Alive? - As you can see, Anya is not a widow yet. - You're a fool, a fool, tiller. I'm glad you're alive too. - Spit! Pah-pah-pah! What are you? - What, for you the war is already over? The Germans are on their way, ours will no longer be. All to the tank, quickly! Run! - Be the loader. - I can't, I'm a tractor driver. - Let's figure it out. Both in the tank! Sailor, Runge, let's get into the trenches with a machine gun. Prevent the infantry from crossing the bridge. - Stop, mother! Where are you going? - Whoa! - Ah? - And who are you? - I? Ivan Pyatov. Duty officer of the tank factory. Mother, help me. Need a ride. - Where are the others? - And there is no one. I was driving alone. Hit a mine. I urgently need to deliver a box to Borovoye. - What's in the box? - There are all sorts of details for military equipment. Here. There, ours broke down on the bridge. I need to get there before the Germans come. - I'm late. The Germans have come. - And how? So let's see what they have for us. - Scary, bespectacled? And I'm shaking like before a fight at a dance. - Kolka! - Ah? - High-explosive fragmentation! - What is it? - High-explosive fragmentation - marking "OF", sub-calibre - "H", shrapnel - "Sh". Remember? - Yes. - You open, you insert, you close. Then I myself. O.K. - Do you have a club? - I have. So there were fights. Why else build clubs? - To show movies. - Now we will show them a movie. - They're leaving! - Hedgehog in your ass! - Shrapnel! - It's better than dancing. Give me another tape. Come on, come on, baby, come on! Alive? - Ah? - Alive, I ask? Hold the tape. - Yes. - More shrapnel! Be careful! - Germans! - Where? - There! - The Germans are on our shore. Disorder. Now you're dancing with me... Aboard! - Where are you going? There are four of them! - Going. O.K.! - Half-hearted! - Alive? Yashka, is he alive? - What? - Are you alive? - Tell me again what you called me? - Yashka, Yashka. - Okay, so you're not a tiller any more. But we will still fight for Anka, Comrade Runge! - Do not even dream. - Schnell! Feuer! - Volley every fifteen minutes. - Would smoke. Fire! Kolka, get back to the gun. Fragmented! - No more ammunition. We're done for without ammo. - Are there grenades? - Do you hear? I don't hear shit. - That's it. They don't shoot? - Drape. - Well, that's good, that's right. Because I wouldn't go into hand-to-hand combat with you, weakling. You don't know how to fight. I don't even have the strength to argue with you. - This is right. - What's loosened up? Not in a resort! - They left in time, there were no cartridges left. - By the way, Runge, I wanted to say - the tank is excellent. Well done engineer. - Yeah, albeit a bore. - Says "Locky 12", says "Locky 12". Our forward unit stumbled upon an unexpected obstacle - a single tank. One tank, no infantry. Apparently it's wrong. He doesn't move. He has a strange shape. It is not penetrated by the 76th gun. Even at close range direct fire. - It is necessary to capture this tank. It must be delivered to our training ground in Bremen. It is also desirable to capture the crew alive. But this is optional. Try to prevent destruction or damage to the tank. Welcome! - Yes, Major. Attention! Start the motors! - Stand! - Hands up! And we don't move. I said hands up. This also applies to you. Who are they? Where we go? - Yes, we are ours. You, most importantly, do not shoot. - Let them talk. - Well, I can do it differently. Get off the cart! On knees. Hands behind head. Inspect cargo. These are parts from military equipment. And I want to know where you are taking them? - The situation is this. Enemy forces everywhere and where our troops are, we do not know. The Germans are coming from there. Our job is to keep them out. We have a tank. We will fight as long as we can. Is the task clear? - Yes, everything is clear. Only my task is to save a valuable and secret tank. You yourself heard that Gordeladze demands... - I'm in command here! Tank is a fighting vehicle. We will fight. And you will all obey me unquestioningly. - I will fight. But the infantry is tired of obeying. - It's a war now. Have you heard about discipline? - Car. - You're crazy! Why a secret tank without disguise? Runge, get out of here immediately. - The tank cannot go under its own power yet. - We cannot allow the secret tank to fall into the hands of the enemy. Then you need to blow it up! - Who are they? - My surname is Gordeladze. I have an order. You must immediately blow up the tank. - I have reason not to believe the verbal order, received from no one knows who and handed over to civilians. - What's your last name? - My surname is Lieutenant Platov. And I have an order - do not let the enemy through this bridge. For this I need a tank. - Comrade Gordeladze, the tank cannot be blown up. This is the only experimental sample. The tank performed great. And my opinion - it should be protected. What is this, sabotage? Blow up the tank! Do not blow up - the tribunal! Shooting! You are traitors! - The Germans will be here before the tribunal. There has already been reconnaissance. I think the main parts will come soon. Such things, Comrade Gordeladze. If you want to help detain the Germans, stay. But I will be in charge. - Disobedience? Surname? - Platov. Lieutenant Platov. - I'll remember. Runge! - Yes. - You answer with your head. And if the tank falls into the hands of the enemy - a tribunal. Is there any fuel? - Very little. Two canisters. This tank is only enough for a few kilometres. - Load the canisters into my back. I have an important secret mission. - Sailor, give him one canister. Runge, pour the second canister into the tank. Take the civilians with you. - They can't be with me. I have a secret mission. - Comrade Gordeladze, how is it in the city, what is there? - Bombing the city, Runge, bombing. - And this... the hospital is bombed? Everyone is bombing. - Have you seen Runge's wife, Anya? What with her? - Saw. She died. In front of my eyes. He did not want to tell Runge, so as not to undermine his morale. - Correctly. And don't speak. Actually don't tell anyone. - Commander, it would be nice to blow up the bridge. - It would be nice, but what? - In the village there is a car with boxes, and they contain explosives. I saw it myself. - Sure? - Yes. - So. Runge, sailor, with me. Kolya, with the tank you remain in charge. Alesya, come with us. You will show a safe road and approaches to the village. Sailor, do you have a weapon? Runge? Hold on. We move forward. - Can I have a gun too? - Why do you need a gun? You have a tank. - Happy! - I ask, where are you taking the military cargo? To the Germans? Defectors? I'll shoot them both! We are not defectors. It's just that the information is secret, we can't say. - So secret that you are with your grandma carrying military cargo through the forest. - Yes, she is not my grandmother. I met her for the first time in my life in the forest. - The last time I ask: where are you taking the stolen goods? - Yes, he is not stolen! I found him in the forest. His car was blown up by a mine. Items shipped straight from the factory. - Well, already something. And who are you? Why are you rolling around in the woods with your belongings? - The Germans came to our village, killed everyone, I was left alone. And I go where my eyes look. Just to be away from here. - And further away, mother, there is nowhere, the Germans are all around. There is nowhere to hide. - There behind Borovoy on the bridge are ours. They were on their way to test a secret technique. But something went wrong, something broke. And now only I can help them with this load. They are now surrounded by the Germans. And if I succeed, they will at least have a chance. So either help or don't interfere! - The Germans are already in Borovoye. We saw it ourselves. Who had time, ran away, who did not have time... they put everyone. So your testers have no chance. - I should at least try. - Well, then on your own two. I won't give you the horse. You're falling into hell. And you, mother, in the cart. Let's go further together. On the way to Borovoye you will only be in the morning. Let's go straight through the forest, so quickly. And the Germans are less likely to meet. To the cart. Go. - The car with explosives has two, the kubel has two to four. So at least six. - Let's finish these off, and the rest will come running. - The fact of the matter is that they will come running, but how much and from where? Do you want to get shot in the back? Do not rush. There are four more. Sailor. - Yes? - Let's. Yours are the ones in the yard. Runge, take a sentry. And I have four at the kubel. We leave for positions, do not shoot without my command. - What should I do? - And you completed your task. Hide and don't show up. Understood? - Stop! Who are you? - Anxiety! - Are you full? - Take it! Purely! - Four. All mine. I'm clean. - Drop your weapons. - Not. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Please! - But you're still a boy. Leave your weapons and run from here. Fast. And don't come back here. Understand? Run! Purely! - Stop! Stop! - What's the matter? - I'm requisitioning your vehicle for military use. - My surname is Gordeladze, I am the secretary of the regional committee. I myself need a car on urgent business. Who are you? Are there documents? - I'll show you a secret document. - What's happening? You... - Did you want to say something? - I... I... - Do you want to help the German army? - Will two be enough? - One for the bridge, the second for the tank. Enough. - Look, I found a radio-transmitter. Now we will have a connection. - Excellent. At least you're of some use, tiller. Nobody left? - Yes, like no one. - More precisely? - Nobody. - Then let's go. - Are you hurt? - Hurt. - You said no one. - I didn't think... I didn't know, forgive me. - You have to answer for your words, comrade intellectual. Go! - Stop! I caught the German wave! - Stop! - The Germans send a special part of the tank destroyers led by a certain Stolz. He has more than a hundred wrecked tanks in Spain, Holland, France. He himself heard about our tank and volunteered for this task. They cast lots as to which shot will fire our tank. - The tank has someone.
