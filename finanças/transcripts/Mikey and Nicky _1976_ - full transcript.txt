That's good. You're doing good. So how do you know there was a contract out on you? Huh? - A guy I know told me. - What guy? A guy I know. Wanted to do me a favor. - Well, who was it? - A friend of mine. A guy. A friend of mine. Wanted to do me a favor. What difference does it make? What do you mean, what difference does it make? Was it a doorman? Was it Frank Costello? - Who was it? - I can't tell you. But you gotta trust me. I know. Take my word for it. 'M felin' you, it was someone I know. Were you in on this deal with Lipsky? Are you crazy? I didn't even know Lipsky till Resnick brought him into the bank. - The runners knew him better than I did. - Well, how do you know it's even true? I got a better one for you. How do you know it's not true? - All right, how much money you got on you? - I got a thousand dollars. A thousand dollars right here. All right, I'll send you the rest. Come on. - I don't want to call the airport from here. - Wait a minute. Where we going? -"M gonna get you out of town. - Now? Yeah, now. Listen, Nick, if they're really lookin' for you, and you say they are, then they're gonna find you. I mean, especially the place that you picked out to hide out in. You're only eight blocks from the office. You said they weren't lookin' for me. - But you said you knew they were. - You said that they weren't lookin' for me. Which way do you want it, Nick? They're lookin' for you or they're not lookin' for you. - They're lookin' for me. - Then let's go. Because two days of lookin' gives them a hell of an edge. You got any clothes here you want to take? I don't feel good. I don't feel good at all. - Goddamn it. -[groans] - What's the matter? - Open the window, Mike. Open the window. Quick! Quick!

So, uh, if I'm right, why won't you wear my jacket? Give it to me. - Here you are. - Here you are. - And here's my coat. - Are you tired? Make sure you put that on because it's damp outside. Give me your coat. You want me to wear this too, don't ya? Sure. You want me to leave this open so that they can see the jacket? - No, that won't be necessary. - Fine. Why bother?

Will you let me carry your gun? - What for? - For luck. If somebody thinks I'm you and they shoot at me, it'd be lucky if I could shoot back. Put this on. I don't want you to catch cold. If you catch a cold on top of your ulcer, that's all I need. Here's the gun. Go ahead. Here's the gun. You're crazy. Here's the watch. - Okay. - Come on.

I'm gonna fall. - All right. - Now I"ve got some instructions to give you. -[man] Listen to me. You're not gonna fall. I figure 15, 20 minutes from here. Um, that depends on how good the traffic is. [clears throat] All right, now, when they get to Second and South, I'll call the B and O Tavern, I'll let the phone ring three times. Understand that? When you hear the phone ring, I want you out of the bar on the street. Now, when you're on the street I'm gonna make my move. I don't want to spend more than ten minutes out on that street. Do you understand? [people chattering, laughing] Nick. Nick. [Mikey] Very little that goes out at night. TWA. No, that's tomorrow. American. That's tomorrow. San Francisco. I want TWA tonight. I don't want to go to the airport. - You don't want to go to the airport? - No. He could have the whole airport surrounded. I'm never going out there. Nick. He would have to hire an army. Do you know what it would cost to cover an entire airport plus the cost of the contract? You're not worth it. I don't want to go to the airport. Now, what do you want to do? You want to take a train? - Why can't you drive me? - Where? I don't know where. Where am I going? Wherever I'm going. You gotta rent a car. [car horns honking] [ticking] [horns continue honking] -“Pull a gun on me, you want me to smile?” - Oh, come on. He doesn't have a gun. Don't know a thing about it. Car rental garages don't open till morning. Jesus. Tough night, isn't it? You want me to get in touch with Jan after you're gone, tell her you"re okay? Jan left me. - She did? - Yeah. - I didn't know that. - Took the kid and moved to her mother's. Jesus Christ, that's terrible. Yeah. I'll get her back. If I live long enough. [laughs] -[sighs] - Where you goin'? Gonna put something on the box.

Beats up all the other kids in the nursery school. Beats up - [laughs] Must be tough. He's enormous. How's your kid? Must be, what, five months now? She is five months, yeah.

That would be funny, wouldn't it? Some guy using a bar as an office. I gotta get out of here. - Nick. Wait. Let me finish my beer. -[Nicky muttering] - Finish your beer. - Wait a minute. I'm gonna call the cops - Wait a minute! Nick, you're going crazy over - - You're like a maniac. - I couldn't breathe in there. - All of a sudden jump up. It's like a maniac. - No air in there. You know that feeling? - Goddamn it, now. - You don't know that feeling? - Listen, I don't want to call you on this. - That's a famous feeling. Came over. You tell me they're after you, I'm here. I'll do what I can. Everything. Listen to me, for Christ sakes. I'll do whatever I can. I cannot do it by myself. - I gotta call - I got a million - - Wanna go to a party? -[laughs] - Hey. - I mean, with a girl. - What do you mean? [laughs] What are you talkin' about? Nick, don't be like this. - Come on. - Whoa. What's the matter with - - I know a terrific girl. - Where are you running to, back and forth? - What the hell is the matter with you? - Got a terrific form. One girl. All right. Where does she live? - Where does she live? Is it far? -[shouts] On Hall and Tenth Street! Listen. Wait a minute. What are you running? She'll wait. - Get off the street here. - Do we have to run? - Wanna go to a movie? - What do you mean, a movie? I feel sick. I don't want to be with a girl tonight. Feel sick to my stomach. - You don't want to go to the girl? - No. Go to a movie. - Your stomach botherin' ya? - Yeah. Didn't I tell ya to have somethin' to eat in the bar, goddamn you? Here. Eat that. If I eat this - - If I eat this, I can go to the movie? - What movie? What movie you talking about? Nick, it's almost midnight. - On 14th Street and Hall, there's a - - Put that in your mouth. There's an all-night movie that's got terrific shows. Double features. They got cartoons. They have 15 minutes of coming attractions. They got a candy counter that's open all night long. And it's got ice cream sandwiches. Everything. The works. Okay. Let me call Annie first. I told her I was gonna meet a guy, have a drink, and I'd be home in an hour, and she's sitting up, she's waiting for me. So let me call her. Where the hell is a phone? What you gonna tell her now? I'll think of something. I don't treat my wife the way you do. If "m gonna be late, or if "m gonna be out all night, I call. What"s the matter? Is my face dirty? You were sitting in that bar for 45 minutes. You never once thought about calling your wife. Never once thought about calling up Annie. [chuckles] All of a sudden you gotta call Annie. I got a terrific suggestion for you, Nick. I suggest you find somebody you can trust. Hey, Mikey. I didn't think of it. How's that for a reason? I had other things on my mind. I'm just asking a question. I got my answer. [people chattering] [phone ringing] -[ringing continues] -[mutters] What"s this? [mutters] [woman] Go on. Say it.

Save yourself for a crowd. [woman] Excuse me. No smoking in the bus. Hey, shut up, will you? -"M gonna tell the bus driver. -[Nicky] I'm gonna tell your mother.

[woman, sarcastically] Oh, dear. - Jesus. You know you've got big hands? -[woman] That's supposed to shock me? - What? - You got big hands. You could've been a piano player with those hands. “Every Good Boy Does Fine” on his lines. And then, “F-A-C-E” in between the lines. My sister played the piano. She taught me a little bit. And you remembered that? That's terrific. [horn honking] [horn continues honking] [bus driver] Main Street! I owe you 200. - What? -200. You don't have to give that to me now. I"m loaded. I don't need that now. I'll let you know if I need it. You okay? Maybe I'll send it to you later. [bus driver] Tenth Street! [bus driver] Twelfth Street! Twelfth and Cottage. That's where my mother's buried. That's where she is. You were there. Weren't you there when she was buried? Of course I was there. Don't you remember? I stayed up with you for two weeks after she died. - Getting off! - What do you mean, you're getting off? - Come on. - Where you goin'? Wait a minute! This is not the movie. This isn't the movie. Nick. This isn't the movie. I wanna visit my mother's grave. I haven't visited my mother for a long time. - Nick, listen. - Hey, wait - Getting off. -[bus driver] Right. - Twelfth Street. - It's past midnight. - I never even bought her a wreath. I'll buy you a wreath. I'll put it on for you. It's past midnight. The gates will be closed. We"ll climb over. When did we ever use a gate to get into a cemetery? What do you mean, “When did we ever'? You make it sound like we're cemetery freaks. - Getting off. - Busted into a cemetery maybe twice for flowers. Twelfth Street. Use the back exit, fellas. -[parking brake sets] - We wanna use the front door. Back exit. That's a company regulation. -[passengers complaining] -[Nicky] He won't let these passengers on. - You see this? - All right. Nick. - You see this? Wait a minute. - I's 15 feet away. Don't you guys have a regulation about letting passengers on? Listen, I saw you sittin' back there before, smokin'. I didn't say a thing. But I'll be goddamned if you're getting out by the front door. - All right, Nick, look - - Open the front door and let the passengers on. You got until I count to five to get out the back door. Then I'm takin' off. - One. Two. - Hey, listen, Nick - - Three. Four. - Fifteen feet away. - Five. - Fifteen feet away. -[parking brake releases] - Nick! You open the door and let the passengers on. [bus driver straining] Open the door and let the passengers out, or I'll break your neck. Nick, this guy is enormous. [bus driver] You wanna fight? Let me go. I'll fight you. I'm not leaving this bus until you fight me. - They can fire me for fightin' on the bus. - Okay, we'll fight outside. Good. Okay, but we don't get off through the front door. Okay, you have my word on that, as long as you let the passenger on first. -[Mikey] That's fair. -[bus driver] Okay. - All right, sit up. - I trust this man. And he has my word of honor. - All right. -[bus driver] You got my word. Go ahead. Then we'll go outside and really have at it too. -[Nicky] Let's just open the door first. -[Mikey] Go ahead. Open the door. [bus driver] No, hold on there! Hold on! [Nicky hooting, laughing] [Mikey grunting] [Nicky] I got you. Come on, Nick. I'm exhausted. Really, Nick. This is foolish. - Shh. - Nick. Please. It's just foolish. It's foolish? Frankly, I think it's ridiculous. You didn't like my mother. I loved your mother. I thought she was a wonderful woman. Why is it ridiculous to visit her grave? - Because it's one o'clock in the morning. - That makes it nicer. Doesn't make it anything, Nick. A grave is a grave. There's not a religion in the world that says a person's soul is buried with them in their grave. That's not your mother in there. - You don't believe in any of that stuff, huh? -[chuckling] No. Come on. You don't believe there's anything after you die. Uh, me, personally? No. I believe you die, and that's it. That doesn't scare you? To think that one day you'll die? You'll be over? You won't be anything. You won't know anything. You'll be nothing. Look, Nick, you wanna visit your mother, let's visit your mother. - Because the conversation is stupid. - It isn't stupid. It's interesting if you're gonna die. Well, I'm not gonna die, so I think it's stupid. Yeah? Well, you are someday. - Look, Nick - - You're gonna die someday. I'm not gonna stand here at one o'clock in the morning and discuss what's gonna happen to me when I die. I mean, that meshugas I leave to the Catholics. [Nicky] Aren't you gonna die someday? Aren't you gonna die someday? Aren't you gonna die someday? - Nick, I'm not gonna - - All I wanna know is, are you gonna die someday? Nick, you want to visit your mother's grave, let's do that and then get out. Give me your lighter. I want to see the names on those headstones over there. [Mikey] Here. Watch it. There's a grave. -[Mikey] Excuse me. - Grave. Let me see this. - Where are you? - Here. -[Nicky whistles] -[Mikey] Excuse me. [Nicky] “Born March 5, 1863. Died January 28, 1930.” That's not it. Are we close, do you think? Nick? Are we close? - Look at this, will ya? - Nick, are we close? I don't know. Gotta see some more names. Is that how you find it? You memorize the names on the headstones? [Nicky] She's buried next to a whole family of Irishmen. It's a Catholic cemetery, Nick. It's full of Irishmen. [Nicky] Look, you don't wanna come with me, let's just forget about it. I'll go alone. Oh, sure, since I climbed the wall and I"m in the middle of nowhere, don't know where the hell I am - - Excuse me. You're gonna go alone? - Who do you keep saying “excuse me” to? [Mikey] Oh, did I make a mistake. Excuse me. [Nicky] You didn't make a mistake. It was a good thing to do. - Hey, Ma! -[gasps] I'm gonna hit you! What for? You afraid I'm gonna wake somebody up? Do you know the difference between not believing in something and having a little respect for it? - Hey, Ma! Where are you? -"m going. - Hey, Ma, where are you? - All right, I'm goin'. I'm go - - Ma? -'m goin', Nick. - I'm here! -'m goin'. Hey, Ma! Ma? If anything happens to me, Mikey did it! Hey! Take that back! - Oh, are you still here? I thought you left. - You son of a bitch! Take it back! Okay, Ma, I take it back. You'll find out for yourself anyway. Listen, Nick. - Hi! - All right, listen. - Let's not fool around anymore. -"m not fooling around. Listen to me, huh? This is a very big park. And I'm sure you'll agree with me that if we look through every headstone - Here. Right here. [Nicky clears throat, sighs] Hey, Mike, you know what? [chuckling] Now that I'm here, I don't know what to do. - Don't do that. -[snorts] My ma doesn't mind me laughing. Do you, Ma? - Stop it, Nick. - I'm just talkkin® to my mother. You don't have to talk out loud to her. [groans] Well, I don't know what to do. [chuckles] - Oh, this is - -[speaking Hebrew] [Nicky] This is tough, man. This is hard. It's very hard to talk to a dead person. - I have nothing in common. [continues speaking in Hebrew] Hi, Ma. [wheezing laughter] Nick, you're makin' me forget the Kaddish. Ma - I'm sorry, Ma. [continues laughing] Ma - [snickering) -[continues speaking in Hebrew] - I don't want to die, Ma. [laughing] - I'm talking to my mother here. -[Hebrew stops] -[speaks Hebrew phrase] - Hey, Mikey - 'm trying to remember the Kaddish. Wouldn't it be great - [Mikey continues speaking in Hebrew] I was just gonna say, wouldn't it be great if she was alive? Don't you wish your mother was alive? Of course I wish my mother was alive. I think that's the reason we're such good friends. Because we remember each other from when we were kids. Things that happened when we were kids that no one else knows about but us. It's in our heads. That's how we know they really happened. What are you talking about? I know what really happened when I was a kid. Yeah, but no one else does. I mean, everyone we knew when we were kids is dead. So what? I still remember what happened. And I tell Annie about a lot of things that happened to me when I was a kid. And she enjoys listening to that. Well, you don't know what I mean. Oh, of course not. 'Cause I'm stupid. No, I - [sighs] I wish - I wish my mother was alive. I wish your mother was alive. And I wish your father was alive, and I wish, uh, my father was alive. I wish your brother Izzy was alive. - Did you know my brother Izzy? - Sure. [chuckles] God, don't you remember? I mean, he lost all his hair. [chuckling] And then we called him Baldy. The next day he died. And then we went down to the grave and we - we said we're sorry, apologized. He was ten years old. God rest his soul. My poor brother. [wheezing laughter] - Oh, this is terrible. -[Nicky snorts, continues laughing] Come on. Let's go. I think it's this way. [Mikey gasps] Excuse me. Watch the grave. [Nicky] Sorry. Watch the headstones. [Mikey] Okay. Excuse me. [laughing] Whoops. Thank God you're here. [Nicky hoots] [shrieks, laughs] [Mikey laughing] You son of a bitch. -[both laughing] - You son of... Oh, you son of a bitch. You got five. You got - You got three and four. That's five and - - What's the difference? -[phone ringing] Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, explain it to me. I been an hour, They're just not gonna show up. They're not gonna show. [man continues on line, faint] Well, did you go, uh - Did you go inside the theater? Warren. I said, didn't you go inside the theater? No, I don't see what you mean. No, I d- What do you think they're planning? To shoot you in a movie house? If they were planning something, they wouldn't be in the theater. Warren - Hey, Warren - Now, I want you to do me a favor. Don't do the job. Look, I don't want to have a misunderstanding with you. - I Know I can get a sale and, uh - I'm gonna - All right, I'm gonna check it out right n - I'm gonna check it out right now. Is it all right? Yeah. That moron's got one idea in his head - “They're screwin' me.” And he don't wanna hear from anything else. You know they're all paranoiac, these guys. Yeah, maybe. But if they're not in the theater... he may be right. [movie: cymbal crash, dramatic orchestral music] -[blows landing] -[man yells] [gong sounds] [movie: men shouting, muttering] May I help you find a seat, sir? No, that's okay. I"m fine, I'm fine. -[shouting continues] -[blows continue landing] Got you. [Nicky laughing] How far are you gonna drive me? We gotta drive to a city where there's an airport and take a plane out. _“We”? - We. - You're goin' with me? - Yeah. Yeah, you son of a bitch. I'm comin' with you. Won't that get you in bad with Resnick? Disappearing like that. Don't you think you oughta make some excuse to him for leaving? These guys don't like to look bad. Fuck 'em.

You liar! - Liar! Liar! - Mike? What's the matter? Fuck off, will ya. You mad? Come on. Don't be mad at me. - Don't be mad at me. - You got all the friends. You got all the money. Did you have to do that to me in front of some dumb bitch to prove you got all the women? I didn't know that was gonna happen. Honest to God. She screws anyone. But me. - Everybody but me. - Mikey, is that my fault? Don't get mad at me 'cause some dumb hooker turned you down. She's your girl. She's not a hooker. You don't pay for that. Mikey, she's a psycho. You gotta - You gotta tell her you love her. You give her a few bucks. You tell her it's a present. I thought that was gonna make it interesting for you. Bullshit. You knew what would happen. Honest to God, Mikey, I-I didn't. - I wouldn't do anything to hurt you on purpose. I wouldn't do anything to make you look bad. You're like my family. I love you. Hey. I think you'd make your family look bad on purpose, 'cause I don't think you love anyone but you. Glad to know what you think of me. Good. Because I'm glad I told you. Now, here's your gun. Give me my watch. - Give me my watch. - No. Give me my watch. I want my watch. - Hey, here's your watch. There's your watch. -[watch shatters] You prick. Is it broken? The watch? Is it broken? Son of a bitch. My father gave me this watch. - Well, give it to me. I'll see if I can - - Get away! Get away! Well, give it to me. Here, I think I know a guy who can put it together again. He's a watch expert. Here. The winding stem is gone. [Nicky] Winding stem is gone. Let's see. Look at this. - Look what you did. -'m sorry. You don't have the time, do you? - You think this is a joke? -[Nicky laughing] This is funny to you. - No. - I had the watch 20 years. - Oh. - Yes. That's long enough. What's this? Is this the winding stem here? This thing? Is that it? I think it's one of the hands. The hands? One of the hands? Jesus Christ, there's nothin' left of this watch. [laughing] You know - You know, there's really somethin' wrong with you. Don't you have any notion of anything that goes on outside your own head? Don't you have any idea how people feel? Can't you understand that my father gave me this watch? - It's the only thing I have from my father. - So what do you want? - You want another one? - Forget it. - Huh? Mike - -"m going. - Hey, Mike, I'm sorry about the watch. - Take your gun. And I'm sorry about the girl too. Wh-What else you want me to say? Nothin'. I don't want you to say anything. I just don't want to do it anymore. - What? - Be your friend. Then I'll be your friend. No, you'll be my friend when you're not in trouble. See, I don't want you to be my friend just when there's nobody else around. What are you talking about? I'm your friend when other people are around. No, you're not. You don't know who I am when other people are around. I spoke to you maybe five times since you met Dave Resnick. I introduced you. I got you the job. - And now I can't get you on the phone. - What are you talking about? - Hey, what are you talking about? -[laughing] - Are you crazy? - I call you, and you never call me back! You don't call me. You haven't called me in months. Yeah, because after three months, you don't call me back, I don't call anymore. You don't even say hello to me. I walk into that restaurant, and you're sittin' there with Dave Resnick and Sid Fine, and I gotta say hello to you three times because I'nm too embarrassed to walk away without an answer. And when I walk away, I hear you say, “Jesus Christ, call that guy back. I forgot to give him the order.” - That was a joke. - That joke was for Resnick. For you. Not for Resnick. That's why I said it loud enough for you to hear it. That was - That was a joke for you. All right. You call me “the echo.” And you tell everybody that I have to say everything twice because I got a tunnel in my head. The second time is the echo. Listen, Mikey, everybody says everything. I mean, uh, what's the difference? I was kidding. Don't you ever kid? You make me out a joke to Resnick... just like you made me out a joke to that girl. Mikey, you're wrong. And I'd do anything for you. Anything. And unless you're sick, or in trouble, you don"t even know I'm alive. And now look what you did. Now you called me. Now I came, and look what you did. And for no reason! No fucking reason! Bullshit! Go find yourself another friend. You're wrong! Really, Mike. Hey, Mike. Hey, hey, Mikey! Jesus Christ, come on. Hey, Mike. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Honest to God, you're wrong. I wouldn't do anything bad to you. I love you, Mike. Please don't walk out on me. Mikey? Please. Please don't walk out on me. Please don't walk out on me. Mike? Screw you. You wanna walk? All right, walk. You got a good excuse now not to come with me, right? 'Cause I call you the echo, right? That's bullshit. I know what you're doing, so screw you! I tell you, screw you! [Mikey laughing] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Is that right? What am I supposed to do? Carry you around with me in my pocket, Mikey? I can't help it, I'm not home when the phone rings. I"m a plenty good friend of yours. Mikey, look. Come on, will you? What other friends have you got? Hey, Mike. ♫ Oh, I'm a Yankee Doodle ♫ Hey, Mike. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that - Let me just talk 10 you a minute, will ya? I'm sorry that Resnick doesn't - doesn't take you to all the restaurants. I don't ask him not to. Look, I swear to you. He doesn't like you. You get on his nerves. I'm the one that stood up for you. I'm-I'm the one that asked you to come into the bank, Mike. Look, with all this crap about how much you do for me and what - what you do for me, what you give me, I"m the one that lent you $200 when you needed it! I don't remember you doin' shit for me! Here. You're a piece of nothin'. [grunting] [panting] [coughs] [panting] [clock ticking] Warren Kinney? Warren Kinney. I just lost the guy about five or six blocks from here. I want you to come around to the side of the car. Guy beat the shit outta me. - Okay, come on. Get in. - We were on Tenth and Hall. That's about five blocks from here. We had a fight. Busted my watch. My father's watch - he busted it. It's the only thing I got from my father. He threw it in the street and he busted it. What"d he do that for? Because he's crazy. And a prick. [sighs] Let's go after the guy. [engine starts] [sirens wailing in distance] Take a right on Hall. Why don't you tell me where we're goin'? I can read the street signs. Not gonna be in the same spot I left him. I said he's around here. Didn't say he was standing in the middle of the street waiting for us. [boat horn blowing in distance] I should have had a driver on this, damn it. [sighs] Every place I been tonight, I couldn't park. There's a “no parking” sign every time I turn around. Make a right. Finally ended up - Wait, I waited in the “no parking” zone for you all night long. - You should've taken a driver. - Oh, Jesus. I take a driver, I gotta pay him a buck too. Shouldn't have needed a driver on this. Make a left. [brakes squeak] Is that him? No. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. You wanna shoot him just in case? What's the matter? I just asked a question. Well, for Christ sakes, if I say it's not him, I oughta know. Yeah, you oughta know. [knocking] Honey? -[knocking] - Go to bed now. -[Nicky] Baby? - I'll be all right. I'll talk to you in a while. - You go to bed. -[Nicky] Honey. Sweetheart. - Let me in? - I told you not to come here. Jan, don't make me yell through the door. Look - - want you to go away. I really mean it. - They're gonna kill me. Well, I'm not interested. - Dave Resnick - - I'm not interested. - He's after me. - Why are you telling this to me? [chuckles] Honey, I'm serious now. - Mmm. - Ed Lipsky's dead. - Dave Resnick had him killed. - Well, I told you that he would. People get angry when you steal their money. Listen, I - I did some serious thinking about myself last night. Good. And about the way I-I've treated you. And [ just want you to know I understand more what you were tryin' to tell me. I'd just like a few minutes to talk to you about it. No. Open the door. I said open this goddamn door before I break it down. You really have changed. I wouldn't have recognized you. I oughta smash your face right in. [Jan chuckles] Bitch! You son of a bitch! I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry, honey. - I'm sorry, sweetheart. - Don't bother being sorry. Just - Just get outta here. - Please, baby, don't treat me like this. - Isn't this the right treatment? Isn't this the way your girlfriends treat you? Tell me how they treat you, and I'll try to copy it. - Jan, I'm sorry. - What's the matter? Is everybody else busy tonight? All your girlfriends busy? The boys too busy to have a drink with you? It's a shame that Resnick wants to have you killed, because now you won't be able to spend all of your evenings with him. Tell me what he used to do that was so wonderful, and I'll try to copy it! Jan. No, I'm not - I did this for you. I went to work for you. - I didn't do it for me. Thank you for supporting me. - That's not what I meant. - don't care what you meant. Don't you get it yet? I really don't care. I just want you to get out of here. - You mean that? - Yes, I do. I mean it. Okay. - Take a look at the baby? - Would it make any difference what I said? Yes. If you don't want me to, I won't. Do what you want. Do what you want to and then get out of here. - Oh. Hiya. -[music box playing] -[baby shouting] - There you are. Come here. Come here, baby. I love you. You Daddy's girl? Yeah. Want to hold Daddy's thumb? -[baby coughs] - Here. Here, sweetheart. Hold Daddy's thumb. Come on. Here. You love your daddy? Huh? -[fussing] - Come on. Hold Daddy's thumb. - Just one - -[baby crying] Here. Here. Look at this. Lookit. All right, all right. [baby shrieks] Guess she's mad at me too. Wouldn't hold my thumb. - Do you need any money? Huh? - No, I'm all right. Need a shot in the head. I'm gonna get that anyway. Why don't you get a hold of Mikey? He'll help you. I can't get a hold of Mikey 'cause we had a fight. - We had a bad fight. - What's the matter with you, huh? - He's the only friend you have. - Not anymore. Did too much to him. Yeah, well, you get out of town. If you get out of town, you'll be - Thanks for the advice, sweetie. What do you want me to do? You want me to die for you? I don't want anything now. I'm going. Kiss me good-bye? No? Yes? No. All right. [sobs] Oh, my God. What are you doing? What are you staying here for? They're gonna get you, Nicky. You've gotta get out of town. I know it. I had to see you. But now you'll go, huh? Please go? Baby, everything's gonna be okay. You know that? - Everything's gonna be great. - Okay. It's gonna be terrific. I promise you, babe. - I can make you so happy. - Yeah? [chuckles] - Sure. - I don't want you to die. - I'm gonna write to you, sweetheart. - I don't want you to die. - Everything's gonna be okay. You love me? - Uh-huh. I do. I love you. Three terrific deals I could've had, and I took this 'cause it was gonna be quick. [sighs] I was gonna use the money to bankroll some machines. Got another guy waitin' with the other half. Make a left. Watch it. There's a guy in this alley right here. All right, right there. Is that him? Is he the guy? Wait a minute! You dumb bastard! Is it him? No. I'm warning you, get out of here. I'm really getting the treatment tonight. Tonight's my night. What do you want? Thought we'd just lie down and talk about politics for a while. You know, I could punch your face right through the wall. You know that. You have no right to treat me like this. - A lady like you. - You better get out of here. Why? Why? Why should I get out of here? I just came over here to say I'm sorry to you. - I'll bet, -"m not kidding. I was a little sore before about Moe Shatz and Jack Diamond. I thought you were my girl. And then I find out that you're putting it out for everyone. Jesus Christ, this, uh - Jesus. What is it? You told them. You told them to try it, both of them. I told them to do that? Are you crazy? [chuckles] Don't. I know. They told me. Both of them. I know all the things that you say about me. I know all about it. [sobbing] Don't cry. Please. Don't cry. No. - Don't be mad at me. - Oh. Like you're mad at me now. Because I told you I know. Ah, "m not mad. Hell. Hell, I don't know what's wrong with me. Guess I just like to show off. - Is that him? - No. Jesus. This is the end. By the time I pay my hotel - - Make a right here. -pay the right fare here, I pay my meals, I ain't gonna make anything on this. No, we seen that guy before. I look like a schmuck. Only got about three, four guys that use me. Now I'll look worse 'cause it was supposed to be easy. It was easy. If I didn't take you 45 minutes to drive downtown, you would've gotten him in the first bar. The hell I could. Oh, no, you don't. Forty-five minutes. I watched the clock. Okay, you tell it your way and, uh, I'm gonna tell it my way, huh? 'Cause all I know is I spent an hour in both places, I never saw the guy. Jesus. That's him. [tires screeching] Let me out of the car. Just take it easy, will ya? Let me out of the car. Let me out of the car. Let me out of the car. [Mikey] That's not him. - You got any ice cream? - No ice cream. We got egg cream, soda, Popsicles, magazines, candy, cigarettes. Just what you see. What kind of a candy store is this, you don't have ice cream? [chuckling] It's a candy store without ice cream. Just what you see. Got Neccos? Look on my counter, mister. What you see there is what I got. I'll take some of these. Take some of these. Caramel creams. - Take some of these lollipops. - All right. - I'll eat this one in the store. - All right. - Put the rest in the bag. - Right. All right. - Got any comic books? - On the rack. [mutters] Promised my nephew that I would find him a comic book. All right. Yeah, sure. So I'm just gonna browse around. Mm-hmm. But don't get "em sticky, please. [clears throat] I don't think they make Necco anymore. So any estimation of time which I may have given him is dependent on the fact that he knows what I've got to get through when I - Okay, okay. So you both had problems. Well, he didn't ask me for any directions on the phone. He just asked me where it was. I gave him the address. -[man] Yes. - You wanna know what I think? I think if I want to find this, uh, buddy of yours, I should stay on your ass. Maybe for the next 24 hours. Well, I'm glad you told me what you think, 'cause I got a lot of respect for your mind. - Mr. Resnick - -[Resnick] Okay, let's quit. Go home. Uh... You wanna drive him home? [man] Fine. -[Kinney] I'll drive him home if you want me to. - Drive you home. Maybe you could even, uh, uh, park in front of his house. That nut could show up there. - He's not gonna come to my house. - Oh? We had a fight. He hit me. He broke my watch. He started insulting me. Oh-ho-ho. He said you didn't like me. [laughs] Go home, Mikey, will you? It's very late. - So, go home and take - - He's not gonna come to my house. - You'll take him home. - Yes, sir, I'll watch him. Y-You want me to stay outside his house, now, don't you? - Yeah. - Okay, I'll do that. - Well, you can't stay out in front of my house. - Why? There's no parking there. -[Resnick] There's no parking? - He can't park there. The owners have hired their own private patrol cars. It's an exclusive neighborhood. They had to vote on me before I could buy the house. So, all right. So, he won't, uh, park. He'll circle the block. [Kinney] Yes, sir. - Dave. - Yeah. If he keeps circling the block, they're gonna notice him. We have our own private patrol cars. Then he'll circle two blocks. How's that? - They're gonna notice him driving around there. -[Kinney] I think I can handle that. Yeah. All right. Uh, take him home. I'm tired. You're tired. He's tired. You're gettin' on my nerves, Mike. - Take him home. -[Kinney] Yes, sir. - Dave. - What? You know, I'm sorry you don't like me. Ah, come on. And I'm sorry I make you nervous. That's all right. [bottle clattering] - Schmuck. -[Annie] What? - Nothing. - Here, honey. You want this coffee? Mikey? Let me put the light on. Why was this off? - Here's your coffee. - Honey, why don't you go to bed? - You're gotta be out on your feet tomorrow. - No, I want to wait up for you. This is such a nice surprise 'cause I thought I was gonna be lonesome and sad. [mock dramatically] You walked into my life. You want one? What time is it? It's about five o'clock. What happened to your watch? - Huh?? -1-1 broke it. Oh, when you fell. Oh, honey. Your good watch. [clears throat] Did you ever go to one of those meetings at school? They have sewing at school. The boys sew. Well, the girls go to shop. You know, because I guess it's, uh - You're not supposed to think that only women sew and only men carve or - [sighs] - Care for a - - Do I repeat myself when I talk? Hmm? When I talk, uh, do you hear me repeating myself? No. Ever? Maybe. I never noticed it. Well, notice it. From now on, when I do something, notice it. Okay, honey. Did I ever tell you I had a brother Izzy who died? No, I don't think so. I don't remember. When did he die? Years ago. This happened when I was a kid. You enjoy hearing stories when I was - well, when I was a kid? Sure I do, honey. Well, Izzy was ten. He had scarlet fever. And when the fever got so high, he lost all his hair. Then he died. That's - [clears throat) terr - My mother just sat there. She didn't even cry. It's a terrible thing, when you lose a child. Was he the baby? No. He was ten. No, no. I mean, was he younger than you? Oh, yeah. My father cried, I remember. But my mother, she just sat there. I was the favorite. - Oh, I see. - My father cried like a baby. And when Izzy got sick, he gave him his watch. - The one I have. - The one you broke? Yeah. But that was... just because he was sick that he gave it to him. Mm-hmm. He meant it for me. I was the oldest. And when Izzy died, he took it back. He gave it to me. He only gave it to Izzy because Izzy was always asking to wear it. Oh, uh, yeah, I guess that, uh, when he knew that Izzy was gonna die... he felt that it was all right, safe to give it to him. That's sad. I was crazy about Izzy. I felt terrible when he got sick. But you know, a kid looks funny when he's bald. Bald? I just told you, he lost all his hair because of the fever. I"m sorry. I forgot. Yes, I see. I see. [sighs] Nick Godolin knew Izzy. Oh, my goodness. Nick Godolin knew my mother, my father. And my Aunt Rose. Hmm. Well, I envy him. Wish I'd known your father. You wouldn't have liked him. He was a very sour man. AnNd he didn't like any of the women in the family. But he liked Nick. And he liked Izzy. See, Nick kidded him a lot. Well, I'm sure he liked you too. [dog barking] Go to bed, Annie. I told you, I'm not a bit tired. I'm not gonna go to bed. - Son of a bitch. - What is it? - Don't answer the door. - Why? Who's coming? -[knocking] -[Nicky] Mikey? - Who is that? Nick? - Don't say anything. -[knocks] - Hey, Mikey. -[knocking loudly] - Mikey. You're gonna make it up with me sometime. Why not now? -[whispering] Make him go. - Come on, Mikey. Open the door. Tell him 'm not here. Get him away from here. Get him away from here. [rhythmic knocking] Mikey isn't here. - Annie? - He isn't home. - What am I gonna say? - Annie, is that you? Did I wake you up, honey? I'm sorry, Annie. I-1 thought Mikey was home. - No, he isn't home. - Oh. You know who this is, don't you? It's-It's Nicky. - Godolin. - Yes. He isn't home, Nick. Oh, he's not, huh? Uh, you think I could come in and wait for him till he gets back? He oughta be home soon because I left him about an hour ago. - He was on his way home. -[whispering] Tell me what to say. Would it be all right? It won't take long. Nick, uh, "m not feeling very well. So why don't you come back tomorrow. Okay? Oh. Gee, honey, I wish I could, but I'm leaving town. It's very important that I see Mikey before I go. Let me just come in, just till he comes home. Well, I-] can't. I'd like to, Nick, but Mikey said not to let anybody in, so I can't. Annie, who you got in there? A Chinaman? Oh, Nick. [laughs] - Come on. - Go home! I don't think he meant me when he said don't let anyone in. Look, Nick, you can't come in. Okay? So please go away, and I'll tell Mikey you were here. Annie. Annie? - Are you mad at me? - No. But - Just go. Look, honey, it's very important that I see him, really. Nicky, would you go away? Annie. You gotta go away, honey! Annie. - Come back tomorrow, okay? - I think you'd better let me in, Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie, I think you better let me in. Please let me in, Annie. - Run, schmuck. -[knocking] - Annie. I-I don't feel good. - But he's not here. AnNnnie, I'm sick. Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie! Annie, please! Annie, I don't feel well. I'm gonna be sick. Oh - [mock retching, coughing] - Jesus.

Get me a doctor! You son of a bitch! Get me a doctor! You goddamn - Goddamn it! - You open - -[pounding continues] Wait! Get me a doctor. Mikey! Mikey! Mikey, I'm sick! Mikey, get me a doctor! I'm perforating. Mike - You wait! Please wait. Wait! Mikey, you son of a - Mikey! You son of a bitch! You bastard! - You bastard! Mikey! -[gunshot] [gasps, groans] -[gasping] - Oh, no!
