You must be Max. >> Hey, I was told you're the guy. Somebody wants to move something quietly on or off a ship, gotta see petey. >> I'm here as a favor to a friend, but I can't help you.

Wait. >> If you so much as stop by that table, I'll have you busted on the spot. >> For bad coffee? >> For interfering with a police investigation. >> Maybe you don't understand who you're dealing with here.

The truck'll disappear, and you'll get a nice bonus. >> I am clean, and I'm gonna keep it that way. >> Well, you should've mentioned that before you let your brother go. >> You let him walk! >> Now, look.

He switched trucks! >> I've heard of apple computers but, uh, never banana. >> Your brother's a pain in the ass. >> They took the truck to a warehouse, and they practically signed for it like federal express. I followed the truck to a wholesale market, but the bananas vanished in a dozen directions. >> So, what's your point? >> Those are photographs of police officers hijacking a truck. >> Allegedly hijacking a truck. >> I'm offering your department an opportunity to respond prior to publication. >> Thanks, but we're internal affairs.

He was pushing all the buttons, trying to find my soft spot. I guess he found it-- my brother. >> Huh! Ooh! >> Kid: Hey, girl! Hey! Aw, he made a basket. >> Like that was something! >> ( Spits ) Hey. You ripped off my bananas. >> Hey, you put me in a bad spot. I had to look the other way. >> I never asked you for anything. >> Yeah, just like I never asked you to do time for me. >> Come on, if you'd gone to prison, it'd have killed mom. She expected me to end up there. >> And I've been paying for it ever since. >> Have you asked yourself why doc came after you? >> Yeah.

I say we finish him off. >> Oh, no... >> You're not a killer, petey. >> Yeah, well, nobody ever killed my brother before. >> If Matt were alive, he'd tell you not to do this. >> That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. >> Aah! >> ( Gasps ) >> Matt's not alive. >> Aah! >> Because you killed him... And you're not gonna get away with it. >> Oh, god. >> How does it feel, asshole? >> Oh, god. >> Well, that kevlar's pretty good stuff. >> Petey, don't. >> Are you telling me not to shoot a guy you just shot? >> But that was different. >> No, I'm gonna finish this. You tell me something. Think I'll do it? Huh? Now, this is for Matt. >> Don't. >> Let's go. >> ( Groans ) >> You see? Turning criminal isn't so hard. >> I'm not a criminal. I'm a witness. >> Tell that to doc. As bad as it would've been if we'd killed him, now it's gonna be worse. >> He's gonna find us, isn't he? He's gonna kill me. >> Us. He's gonna kill us. Stop being so self-centered. Son of a bitch was right. >> About what? >> About me. He said I couldn't do it, and I couldn't. >> But that's good. >> You won't say that when he finds you. >> ♪♪ >> all right, I'll show you. So, you just sway your hips. That's it. Step. Step. And then you turn around like that. That's it. There you go. It's pretty easy. I mean, just feel the music. >> I feel dumb. >> Tsk. You're just a little shy, that's all. But it's pretty simple. You just keep going. Just go up, up, you know, and then move your arms way up in the air like that. It looks great. You got something, I can tell. >> Uh, why here? >> You ever been here before? >> Well, hardly. >> Oh, petey, this place is better than prison. The women here are beautiful. They sing, they dance, and they're all guys! No offense. >> None taken. >> You remember Dexter? >> Sure, the hooker. >> Too bad. She's your new roommate. >> Well, thanks, petey, but I don't need her. >> I'm not a hooker. >> Oh, I get it. You're a guy, too. Had me fooled. >> I've never been in trouble like this before. >> Well, you get used to it. >> You don't understand. You know, I write about stuff like this. This is not supposed to happen to me. I just want this to end. Do you realize that when I first met you, I was an unidentified witness? Now I am a fugitive on the run from a renegade cop whom I shot! >> Shh. Shh. >> What? Wait a minute. Wait, what are you doing? >> I thought maybe you'd want some comfort. >> W-weren't you even listening to me? You know... Don't confuse what happened between us with a relationship. Where are you going? >> I got business. >> Well, I'm gonna go with you, then. >> No, in the pirate business, we tend to frown on press coverage. >> You don't trust me? >> Don't confuse what happened between us with a relationship. >> You're right. This is research. It's the story of a lifetime. >> Fine. Just stay here. And no reporter stunts, okay? No phone calls. Try to think like a fugitive. >> Sounds like a prison. >> Believe me, prison is worse. >> ( Sighs ) >> ♪♪ >> Hey, petey! >> You looking for me? >> What, are you lost? >> Well, doc and I had a misunderstanding. I thought maybe you put out a bulletin. >> No, no, no. Just doc has his own ways. >> Yeah, well, recruiting dirty cops is risky business, unless, of course, you're internal affairs. Then you have all the dirt on everybody. >> Well, I can't comment on that. >> Doc come after you, Mario? Hmm? I mean, not a lot of cops eat here. >> It's a gray area, petey. I'm a very accessible cop. People like to give me things. Nothing big, no cars. No yachts. Does that make me a dirty cop? >> You tell me. >> I'm a good cop, and you know that. But if it came down to it, could I convince a judge or a review board? Nah. >> Look, you can't have it both ways, Mario. You have to chose sides. >> You say that as if you're going after doc. >> He killed my brother. >> Don't, petey. They're unstoppable. >> Why do you think doc went after Matt? >> The armored car. They were gonna pressure Matt to get to you. >> So, where can I find Max? >> You know I can't tell you that, petey. >> You crossed the line for them. Why not for me? >> You know, Max, after this job I'll never eat pizza again. >> Your kid Vinnie. He may be a hell of a thief, but he makes a lousy clam sauce. >> Nice office. >> What the hell you doing here? >> I'm reconsidering your offer. >> Butt out of this, petey. >> Max, you replaced me with Joey the fist? >> Hey, this guy's got a very impressive crew. >> I'm not surprised. They're all undercover cops. You recruited a sting operation to pull your job. >> Don't listen to him. >> Look at this. Look at this, huh? There's cops all over the place here! They got him wired. Can you hear me, doc? Test, one, two. >> He's full of shit, Max. >> Why should I believe you? >> Because otherwise your armored car's gonna get hit by cops, dirty cops. And then they're coming after you. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Look out! >> Hold it! >> You're being set up. >> I'm getting outta here. >> No! No! No! No! This way! Go! Come on! Come on! Hit it! >> So, why did you suddenly decide to save me? >> It's not about you. You still have a shipment. I want the job. >> Hey, I thought you didn't want the heat. Now it's gonna be ten times as hot. >> It's personal now. >> All right, I owe you. You kept me out of the can. >> They weren't gonna arrest you.
