Albert, slow down. Smell the pine. That's no pine, that's wheelchair exhaust. Well, let him go. I can take him. He's handicapped. The hell he is! He's probably got a 350 fuel-injected turbo in there and the whole works! Albert! I can take him! Albert, when you were born, were your parents expecting children? Shut up! Okay, let's go. Hi, you must be... How many campers in wheelchairs you got? Oh, I thought this was one of those new Hondas. Not unfunny. Tommy McVee. Pleased to meet you. I'm Giddy. Oh, yeah? Where's Happy, Sneezy and Grumpy? Not unfunny. You know where you're goin'? Yeah. Check out the chicks. Catch you later, Bashful. Fanny. Fanny, I know a place where the four of us can go and the perfect place. I mean, the two of us. All right, jerk off, Albert. Come on, everybody, let's go. Form up at your cabin assignments. Move it. Move it. Oh, and you boys, keep your pinkies the hell away from my ladies. Come on, girls, this way. Come on, "pinkies?" God, do you believe her? This is the exact same camp that was in that movie, Friday the 13th. The one where all those kids got murdered? Dead for no reason. Aw, relax, everybody's nervous the first day. Look at this shit. Okay, here's eight stamped postcards. I want you to send me one a week, so I know you're okay. Ma, you're trying to live my whole life for me. How can you say that? These cards are already written. No talking after lights out, Barry. I'm Larry, Dad, he's Barry. Oh, sorry, Son. And be sure to eat everything on your plate, Larry. I'm Barry, Mom. He's Larry. Oh, sorry, Son. Remember to be a good sport, Barry. I'm Larry, Dad. I'm not your father, Barry, I'm your mother. I'm not Barry. I'm Barry, Mom. I'm not your mother, Larry, I'm your father. I'm not Larry. He's not your father. I'm gonna miss you, Damian. I'll miss you more, Susie. Can I have somethin' to remember you by? And I don't want you smoking pot. Ma, I might just experiment. Well, don't pay for it. Hey, are those alive? No, they're stuffed. You mean like cashews, bread crumbs, raisins? How much you want for one? Hey, they're pets. Psst. You need a fix? What have you got? What's your thing, man? And remember, boys only want one thing. What's wrong with that? They never want it when you want it. Camp, go. Four-wheel drive, man. Four-wheel drive, you numbskull. Looking good, young trooper. Cease, ho. That's it. Double time, young troopers. Get to those or die. Pick up that fork-nosed rifle. Come on, lunge, twist and hold. Hee-yah. Hee-yah. Rip 'em from across the craw, boy. That's it. All right, move 'em out, trooper. Fine bunch of campers this year, Foxglove. Mmm-hmm. Hmm. I tell you, they're naturals. You'd put a pig sticker on the end of a rifle and a boy knows just what to do with it. Hmm, God, I love it so. Hmm. Let's go. Young whippersnapper. Get outta here. This place sucks. Sally Friedman? Here. - Tula Washington? - You're lookin' at her. Nancy Lamon. Okay now, Cabin six. Which one of you boys is Armand Carducci? All right, I'll repeat myself. Who's Armand Carducci? The name is Flash and it's the only one I answer to. Okay, Flash. Now, I'm Giddy. Uh, Coach Giddy. I'm the head counselor here. Damn. I'm in charge here. I got the picture. Good. Now, we're not comfortable with trouble at Sasquatch. So don't give me any. I hear what you're sayin'. Now I know your reputation, Flash. There's only one thing I like about it. Yeah? What's that? How open are you to the concept of pugilism? What kind of weird shit goes on around here? I'm talking about boxin'. The sport, fighting with rules. I don't do rules. I hear you're pretty good with your hands. Yeah? So what if I am? Well, we got a tradition around here. It's called Champ of the Lake. It's us against Camp Patton. Camp Patton. That's the camp across the lake, the other side there? Sort of like a summer Golden Gloves. Now we got a fighter, it's Boomer. He's great. But he needs a little help, Flash. He needs a sparring partner. A real two-fisted talent, somebody like you. What do you say? Listen, Mr. Coach, I'm not what you call a team player. What if I said I'm tellin', not askin'? Are you? No. So then, why don't you back off my case, huh? I don't do volunteer work. You wanna give me Cabin six? I'll take it. The judge says that's my sentence. That's the total picture, all right? You know, if you change your mind... Forget it. Trade you my goalie stick for a Clark bar. Hey, cool it, Butterball. I don't do exclusives. I gotta build up a clientele. That watch quartz? Yeah, but my dad gave it to me. You always get the bed by the window. But I'm the oldest. That's mine. It's mine. Who does Mom love best? Me. So you wanna take the shirt, too? All right, you turkeys. Shut up! Oh, my gosh. The name's Flash. Mr. Flash. And I only got one rule. Don't bug me! You got that, you little twerps? If you got a problem, tough, don't bring it to me. I don't do problems. Mr. Flash, can we... Hey, one more thing you should know. I don't do questions, either. See that, Foxglove? Morons, wimps and losers. Same as last year, sir. This summer we're gonna crush 'em. That's the spirit, sir. Is that a lisp? Did I hear a lisp, Foxglove? A lisp, sir? Goddamn homo talk. Impossible, Colonel, we're alone. Cover my back. Yes, sir. I was seein' this guy, real cute, but they hated his guts. And they were drivin' me crazy. Well, I was drivin' them crazy. So they decided the best thing for me was camp. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. This one I just couldn't resist. What do you think? They're really nice. I couldn't make up my mind. Hey, you, uh, wanna borrow one? Gee, do you think that'd be okay? Oh, sure, I got tons. What about shorts? You got shorts? Well, not exactly. Here, try these. Oh, and this goes really cute with that. Oh, Nancy, I couldn't. Listen, we're sisters, right? It's us against the pinkies. Go on. Okay, thanks. But you... You like me or not? Yes, I like you. But I think we should set a good example. Oh, well, look, nobody knows we're here. This is a great place. Not like that spot last summer? Uh, no, no, no, no. All those kids, all those flash bulbs? No, no, no, no, no. Or that time down at the lake? Oh, Fanny, look, snakes only come out like that once a year. Are you sure we're alone? Sure, look around. You know, it's just getting so foggy that I think we should go back to camp. What do you mean, it's not that foggy. Oh, we'll do it some other night. Mom, it's really creepy here. I wanna go home. But you'll like this camp. Sonny, you'll see. But it's not even in our solar system. Hey, don't you want to earn your Earth Merit Badge? Yes, Dad. Then what's to talk? Now, Sonny, it looks like rain, so be sure to wear your little raincoat, dear. But I don't want to wear Earth clothes. That's nonsense, Son. You're going to be just fine. You'll see. Listen to this. Who spent 325 jamochas on English lessons for you? You, Dad. So, kiss your mother goodbye. Goodbye, dear. And be careful from the poison ivy. Okay. Good morning, Rene. Ah, big day ahead of us, huh? You under control in here? But of course. Uh-huh. Some little adjustments maybe, eh? Listen to me, you crazy frog. I want food we can eat. Burgers, doggies, home fries, eggs over easy. I'll go as far as French toast, but nothing, nothing fancy. You know where I'm comin' from? Oui, monsieur. I don't. Come on, will you? Open up. Come on, open up! I'm going first. You always go first. Who was born first? Me. So gimme a break, will you? I gotta go! Both of you? At the same time? That's sick. What's the problem? I think somebody died in there. Here, take this. Let her rip. What is it? I don't know. That sure is no pet. - Ted's right. - He's afraid. He's not the only one. Do you think maybe, like, maybe he's from... Are you from space? Did you see that? Did you? I mean, wow! It understood. Yeah, it did. It really did. That sure is a great trick. Do you have a name? Where are you from? Me, Ted. Who are you? Me Ted. What did he say? I think he said meathead. Meathead. Meathead? Meathead's what he said. Meathead. Listen, uh, Meathead, we won't hurt you or anything. We're just, well, you know, curious. We've never seen a... A something like you before. Look, we gotta go for breakfast. Do you want us to bring anything back? Uh, Big Mac. How does he know about Big Macs? Think he's got a guidebook? Right. But he does, seriously. Okay, ladies... On the toes. Come on. Hurry up, we're late. Just put this. Hurry. Will you hurry? Put your head back. Hi, girls. What's happening? My name's Flash. What's yours? Don't talk to him, Cheryl, he's a dork. I'm not a dork, I'm Italian. Other way. Hey, Flash. Nah, I'm just lookin'. Come on, come on, come over here. Did you ever put the gloves on? Where I come from, fighters don't have time for dressin' up. Besides, I'm just lookin'. Kick 'em high, ladies. Up, up, up. Hey, Boomer. Boomer. This is Flash. The kid with the reputation. Oh, yeah. Uh, hey, Flash. How's it goin'? Uh, pretty slow. I can believe it. What is that, some kind of crack, uh, Bash? Flash. Oh, yeah. Hey, you know, Mash, you got a pretty good sense of humor. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna knock it right outta your head. Wham, bam. Wham. What do you think of that? You wanna try? Sure. I love fightin'. Put 'em on. All right. Kick 'em high, ladies. Up, up, up. Raise those thighs. Well, you take it easy. Keep your guard up, huh? Nothin' fancy. Come on. Right here. Right here. Come on. You gotta do better than that, Bash. That's all for today, ladies. Let's go. Hey, Trash. Hey, didn't anybody ever tell you boxing and broads don't mix? That guy really is a dork. A what? A dork. You know, dork. Oh, yeah, sure, a dork. Hey, like, you know, you know, you're a pretty good fighter, Crash. Thanks. You're not so bad yourself, Bloomer. My name is Boomer. What are you, makin' fun of me again? Oh, I'm sorry. Nancy, will Flash always be a dork? You really don't know what it is, do you? A dork. You know, like in, joystick? Heater, wang, pud, equipment? Uh, pinkie. Oh, that's what it is. So you didn't know, right? Well, I mean, I knew... You ever seen one? Sure. Lots of times. What, you got a brother or something? No. A boyfriend? Well, not really. Well then, who? "Who" what? Whose did you see? Oh. Look, come with me and I'll show you a couple of real doozers. Oh, my God. Try not to have a heart attack. Ooh, boy, he is really somethin'. I've seen bigger though. You mean, they come in different sizes? Haven't you ever seen one? Hey, guess who's never seen... Oh, nice going. What did I say? What'd I say? Whoa! I've never seen one that big before. You've never seen one period. Have, too. My brother. Yeah, but he's five. No, he's six. You know, Tula didn't mean anything by that. It's just that... Well, you act like you've been in a convent your whole life. Well, I haven't. It's just that we don't discuss those sort of things. And nobody ever even talked to you about it? You mean S-E-X? Don't tell me, like, they always spelled it out? Always. Oh, brother. You don't know anything, do you? Come on. Okay, you guys, listen up. You know, like, there was a time, not so long ago I might add, when all of us were just as deprived as Cheryl here. So I say that we gotta help her. I say that we take a pledge that before camp ends... She sees a pinkie! All right. Are you sure? Yes. What's goin' on in here? Nothin'. Is that a fact? Oh. Whose is this? No matter. It's confiscated. Just remember, ladies, that this is a cabin for proper young women. There will be no talk of pinkies. They're not play things, you know. They're weapons. Dangerous weapons. Like loaded guns. They can go off when you least expect it. Do I make myself clear? Yes, Fanny. Good. Oh, what a beautiful day. You really think so, do you? Boomer. Boomer. Boomer. Boomer! Uh, hey, Giddy, that you? I can't see. I got a canoe on my head. I noticed. Boomer, please, the lake's the other way. Oh, thanks, Giddy. Don't mention it. Giddy. I'm going lose... Oh, oh! I think I got a fish in my pants. Oh, no, wait, it's just me. Oh, what's it called? Kybo. K-Y-B-O. Keep your bowels open. They were supposed to burn them when they switched over to what we have now. I mean, no one will come here. It's totally safe. Yeah, I can believe it. So what you think, Meathead? Kybo, huh? Okay. That one. I like that one. Quarter-moon. Good choice. Thank you. Oh, did somebody fart? Oh. Move 'em out. Ten, hut! Two fingers off the bridge of the nose, young trooper. Ten, hut! Chief Rawhide's here to see you, sir. Hmm. Is he wearin' those damn feathers? Yes, sir. Accented by some lovely little beads. A lisp. God damn it. Foxglove, I heard a lisp. I'll check into it, sir. I hate feathers. Bitch. How? Who? Where? Here. What? Rights to lake. No acid rain. Good. No PCBs. Great. Clear like mountain stream. I love it. Many fish. Hmm. Wind surfing potential. Ah-ha. Good deal. Hmm. You make fair trade. I'm a fair guy, Chief. Honest Injun. Injun. Attention. Good morning, Colonel. You call these ankle biters campers, Giddy? My God, it's worse than last year! It's a goddamn waste of human potential. Listen to me, you pipsqueak pistol packin' package of paramilitary paranoia... How do you say that so fast? I hear what you're saying, Colonel. Well, of course, you can hear me. We're only six inches apart. No, no, no, no, I mean, I mean, I... I respect your space. I know where you're comin' from. Oh, don't give me that communication bullshit, Giddy. I'm here on a mission and I will not be heard! I mean, you will not hear me. You... Well, I'll tell you where I'm comin' from, Giddy. I'm comin' from my lake! Show him the papers, Foxglove. Yes, sir. It's mine. All mine! From shore to shore. Men! You mean, the Chief sold you... But I... Wait a minute. Well, what good is my camp without a lake? Exactly my point, Counselor. This year's Champ Sunday is gonna be your last. Foxglove! Wait, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel. Please, please. Let's... Could we discuss this over lunch? Lunch? You're nuts. We're gonna pave this place, Foxglove. We're gonna wall-to-wall concrete it. We're gonna flank it with howitzers, and we're gonna bring a whole goddamn division of T-47s right here. Relax. Relax. I can handle this. I can. I hope he's okay. It was your big idea. Oh, I'm sorry, guys. It's only me. Sorry. What are you doing here? I came to tell you I'm okay. Hey, what's goin' on out there? Uh-oh, be cool, guys. Be cool. Sorry, Mr. Flash. Easy, Barry, tell him you're just scared. Just... Scared. Scared. Your mothers will be a whole lot sorrier if the Flash misses out on his sleep. Uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Hit the sheets. Meathead, you gotta start using the door around here. You okay? Was that close, guys, or was that close? Oh, I've seen closer. Well, maybe not that close. What the goddamn hell is that, Foxglove? Sounds like tambourines. Whoa, Marcel. Whoa, Havoc. Colonel, what a pleasant surprise. Don't give me that bleeding heart routine, Giddy. I wanna know... Wanna know what those... Priests. Priests. What are they doing? Praying. Praying? What are they praying for? Likely a new home. Home? Home, what home? God's truth, Giddy. What have you done? Like I said, Colonel, what good's a camp with no lake? But a temple. Huh, temple? No. No! Yeah, I'm goin' back to the urban ghettos. Poverty, crime, trash, disease, honest work. Look, you can't do that. I've had good years here. Wonderful kids. Some success stories. I wanna give something back. These people need a place to let their sheets down. Hey, Giddy, no, you can't do it. You can't do it. You can't! These people, I hear they wipe with their bare hands. That's just it. They don't use water. Giddy. Hey, Giddy, look, I'll be the first to admit I've been rash. Oh, now, wait. Here comes one of them now. Hi, Your Excellence. Come in. Oh, Giddy, are you outta your mind? Your Excellence, please shake hands with a good friend of mine, Colonel Hershy. I love you. Oh, get him... Get him outta here, Giddy. Your Excellence, Your Excellence, five minutes and then we'll finish the paperwork. Okay? Giddy. Giddy, Giddy, please. You've got to listen to me. Part of me hears what you say and then part of me doesn't. Jackboots and marching tunes are a thing of the past. Bare feet and mantras are taking over the country. Oh, no, not you, Giddy. Now listen. There's gotta be some way. There's always Champ of the Lake. Champ of the Lake? What are you talkin' about? Make sense, Giddy. Our last fight, Colonel. How about I hold off the sale? Would you like that? You're damn right I'd like that. You raise the stakes on Champ of the Lake, I'll put a hold on their deal. Raise the stakes? Sure I'll raise 'em. Christ, Giddy, you name it. My camp for your water rights, all or nothing. The whole shootin' match? Kit and caboodle. Lock, stock and barrel? The works. From here to eternity? The whole enchilada. Damn it, I'll take it. I'll take the whole goddamn thing. Foxglove! Hook, line and sinker. All right, Mr. Dumbjohn. Yeah? I know what this is. What does this mean? This one's for you, this one's for the horse you rode in on. Hey, hands off that horse. That's my horse. Ah-ha, I knew it would feed an army. Why, you... Didn't I tell you campers, no smokin'? Didn't I? Didn't I? I should hope so. Filthy habit. The Colonel's expecting you. Despot. You called, sir? Of course, I'm called "sir!" I'm a bloody colonel, aren't I? Yes, sir. Sergeant Paladin, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to sound off like you got a pair, move out like you had a purpose, grab your squad, hit that assault craft, cross that lake and neutralize this idiot with extreme prejudice. The ancient Sasquatch Indians used to boogie to this one and now so can you! Are you gonna be okay here? Yeah, I'll be fine. Okay. I wanna dance. Oh, yeah? With what? I want somethin' tall, lean and mean. There's a horse outside, why don't you go get it? I ain't into that sort of thing. That's not what I heard. Have you been talkin' about me again? I don't care. Those guys are always talkin' about me. So what? So what? You wanna dance? Shit. Cheryl, uh, I, uh... Can you talk? Yes. Oh, it just seems like you're not that heavily into conversation. Oh, well, I'm just not used to it. With boys, I mean. Well, you can practice on me. Okay. Flash, people, they talk, you know, and... Well, they say you're sort of mean. Oh, yeah? Just tell me who it is and I'll... I mean, did they really say that? About me? Nah, I can't figure that out. I mean, how many mean altar boys have you met? You're an altar boy? Are you kiddin'? Me and the rabbi are like this. Rabbi? Oh, uh, well, see, that's what I call... As a matter of fact, he can't kiss nothin' unless the Flash checks it out first. Like the robes and the cups and the crosses and shit like that. Listen, uh, you wanna get some holy water or somethin'? Okay. All right. Yep, that's him all right. You want me to drop him? Get a grip on yourself, we got orders. Okay, men, let's move out. Psst. Hey, come here. Hey, who is that? It's me, Boomer! Oh. Hey, I'm Boomer. So will you do it? I don't know. I mean, streaking's not such a big deal anymore. Believe me, for some people it'll be a major deal. So, uh, what do I get for pullin' it off? Okay. You talked me into it. Don't forget, it's Cabin 10. Come on, Fanny, I got the perfect place. You seen Boomer? Hi, Jamie, Fanny. Have you seen Boomer? Boomer? No, he's not here. No, he's not here. Oh, Fanny, I'm sorry. Okay, here you go! Give me the other one. Okay, okay. Fanny? Fanny? Jamie? Ta-da! Oh, shit! Hey, Meat, what you doin'? What's happenin'? Lookin' for somethin' to do. Why the raincoat? Oh, it's gonna rain. Good, Meat, be prepared. Hey, look! Hey, he's doin' it again. Hey, Meathead, come on. You gotta act sorta normal around here. You can't walk through stuff or people are gonna know you're, uh, different. Yeah, you're right. You guys go ahead. I'm gonna practice walkin' around stuff. So long, Meat. See you later. Okay. Gee, I wonder when I'm gonna get to play basketball. Or use a bow and arrow. Somethin'. Anything. Hey guys. Uh, uh, excuse me. Here. Flash, why are you a dork? Are you for real? Yes. Are you for real? No, no. I meant... Forget it. Flash, don't be afraid. Me afraid? Hey, I'm heavily into rockets and saucers, and well, creatures. You guys know about this? I mean, him? Wait a second. How long has he been here? A few weeks. And I didn't notice? Uh, I guess I wouldn't have. Nobody else has either. I don't know. He's no trouble. We promise we won't let him bug you. Flash, call me Meathead. Okay, Meathead. I'll take a shot. Uh, you know, you're not such a dork, Flash. Hey, Boomer, what gives? He's goin' bozo, Crash. I told him I still got a right. You gotta stop him, Crash. They're gonna hurt him worser than me. You don't mean he's gonna... Yeah. You gotta tell him, Flash. See, I don't need no knuckles to fight. I don't need no hands or feet either. You know why? Because I'm gonna beat him with my brains. That's right. I got more brains in my little finger than I do in my whole head. Take it easy, will you? I gotta think. Yeah, you're lucky that way. Look, I wanna fight. What? Champ of the Lake. I'll take it. Thanks, Flash, but it's my fight now. I'm your fighter. I thought the Flash don't do volunteer work. Yeah. Well, that's a fact, but sometimes a situation comes up that calls for a little of the Flash's specialty. Hey, I'm talkin' to you. You? Yeah, me. Champ of the Lake? Yeah. I think I like it. All right! All right! All right, Giddy! Way to go! Here you go, boy. Ooh, yeah, Mad Dog. Ah! Ooh, Mad Dog, Mad Dog. Bad Mad Dog. Get outta here. I wonder what Giddy's got up his sleeve. We need information, Paladin. Sir? I want a prisoner. Yes, sir! Not one of ours, you tank tread! One of theirs! A goddamn red-blooded Sasquatch! Yes, sir! Hey, Flash. What do you want? Listen, I feel sorta funny about doin' this. Doin' what? Cheryl would kill me. What for? But I'm doin' it for her. Of course you are. What are you doin'? Well, she wondered if you'd... Oh, I shouldn't. Yeah, she wondered what? If you'd go skinny-dipping tonight. Me? I knew I shouldn't. Me and her? Yeah. Alone. Tonight? Down by the cove? Okay. Tell her I'll meet her there. Tonight? The shooting stars. He wants you to watch with him. The stars? You know, like the Big Dipper and stuff like that? The Big Dipper? Now remember, men, this is not an ordinary mission, this is the mission! You all got your cyanide capsules? Mmm-hmm. All right. Now you people are the finest counterinsurgency team I've ever trained here at Patton. I don't want you screwin' it up! You read me? Yes, sir! Move 'em out! I want you to go through those Sasquatch creeps like crap through a goose! By God, you pull this off and there'll be ice cream for dessert tomorrow! A great night for shooting stars. Yeah, and, uh, shooting moons? Well, where do you ever see a shooting moon? Mostly out of car windows. We got the best view. Hey, you guys, here comes Cheryl. Hi. Hi. I'm glad you came. Well, I didn't wanna miss it. Yeah, me neither. What's happening down there? Shh, you want them to hear us? No. Look at there! Lookie, quick. Look, look. It's all new to me, you know? Yeah, I kinda guessed that. Do you mind explaining as we go? Sure. No problem. Oh, good. This is called first base. Where? I don't see it. Sorry. Look, I thought I was gonna see the Big Dipper. Yeah, we'll get to that. Well, where is it? Oh, my God. Okay, this is it. It's a nice spot. Really secluded. Are you sure it's safe? Does a bear shit in the woods? So you ready? For what? To go in the water. The water? Can you see better from the water? Absolutely. Oh, please. You go over there and I'll go over here and I'll meet you in the water. Okay. I trust you, Flash. Water? Shh!

Giddy, be reasonable. What good is a camp without a lake? Colonel, I'm sensitive to your needs, but a deal's a deal. Oh, deal! Hold it, hold it! I hear where you're coming from, Giddy, but I've ordered a submarine for next year. Colonel, you really have to refocus your energies. Now, look, this winter I'm offering a workshop. New directions in lifestyle orientations. You can't do this to me! Giddy! I'm warning you, I'll be back! Next summer, Giddy, I'm gonna be back! And I'll be back, Giddy!
