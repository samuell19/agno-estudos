[birds singing] [music playing] [guns firing] [screaming] [guns firing] [screaming] [guns firing] [screaming] [guns firing] [dramatic music] [screaming] [guns firing] [thunder rumbling] [classical piano music] [groaning] Every day is a day of decision. Most days our decisions will be about small matters. There also will be days when our decisions will be turning points in our lives. Guidance. [groaning] [tapping on floor] MAN: Colonel Vail, sir. Colonel Vail, sir. Yes? Dinner, sir. Colonel Ladislaus, Major Jordan and Captain DeSantis are already eating, sir. Thank you very much. You're dismissed. [door opening and closing] [muttering] JODY: (SINGING) I don't know why I keep going 'cause my heart just keeps on breaking. I can't seem to find my way back home. Tell me where I can find a love who can give me love I'm giving. I can't seem to find a love that's real. I can't seem to find a love that's real. Let me see your pass, ma'am. [dog barking] She's clear. That reminds me of that job that time-- you know that-- that old guy with a goofy hat. I must have emptied an entire mag into that guy and he just keeps waving around this rusty old sword. Same thing with this hombre. He was dead five times over and he keeps shaking his finger at me like, who the hell are you? This is just a wedding. You ever do that? Miss a guys vitals on purpose just to see how much he could take? Jeez, I'm living with a bunch of stiffs. OK. Who wants to go over the wall tonight? MAN: Quit talking trash. Seriously. Willy, I'm bored with this place. Same old faces, same old food, same old whores. We volunteered. Some of us volunteered. It was either this luxury hotel or the men in the funny white coats. Right, Frank? That night in Wichita, Mike, when those kids got in your way and you decided they were the enemy, how many kids did you take out? They had it coming, Frank. What's wrong with you guys? [sighing] I hate soft targets. [clanging] Frank, right? Excuse me. Hey, how come you never want to party? I don't have time. Don't be a blanket, honey. I'm saving up for college. Good. Yes, ma'am. The boys have been seeing your charms for a month now so-- well, I just had to order myself up a treat. [giggling] Well, good thinking. What, the maid's on strike or something? Yeah. JODY: Hey, don't. Ow. Hey, cut it out. [door banging] The password. Yeah. [music playing] MUSIC: (SINGING) I've been estranged-- Hi. Hi, baby. Sorry I woke you. Well, I wasn't sleeping. You said you'd be here two days ago. Yeah. Well, I couldn't call you where I was and, you know, when I got in I didn't want to wake you. Come on, baby. I really missed you. Come here a minute. Come here. Ah. Did you? Where were you? The Middle East, Bosnia, Armenia, Latin America-- where? You know I can't tell you that, Janice. Yeah, well, wherever you were you're still there. It's not working, Colin. I didn't marry you just so I could live alone. I hate it. It'd almost be easier if you did get killed on one of those special jobs you do for the Special Forces. At least I'd be able to mourn. [door clanging] Christ. Ah-- Oh, god. Where is it? [vermin squeaking] Colonel Vail, you're not allowed to be here, sir. [clanging] [thumping] [suspenseful music] [distant begging] [distant shouting] MAN: Find number one. [alarm blaring] MAN (ON SPEAKER): Stop. Stop where you are. God. MAN (ON SPEAKER): Do not proceed. I repeat, do not proceed. Colonel Vail, if you proceed we will have to shoot. [guns firing] [shouting] [suspenseful music] MAN: Come on. Turn off the goddamn siren. What the hell's going on, Captain? Sir, it's Colonel Vail, sir. Shit. Seal off the southwest sector now. Yes, sir. [guns firing] [explosion booming] [guns firing] Drop the gate! Drop the gate! Fire. Fire. [explosion booming] [distant explosion booming] [birds chirping] It's me. Hey, you. [dramatic music] [phone ringing] Hello. Neal. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You have to go? Now? For how long? I don't know that, Janice. I'm sorry. - You're sorry. Colin, If you go now I won't be here when you get back. [sighing] [door closing] [birds cawing] Colonel Frank Vail. He trained your unit eight years ago. COLIN: Yes, sir. Are you friends? We were. He died, sir. About five years ago he experienced post-traumatic stress disorder while on leave. He had a flashback. There were casualties-- I understand civilians. I tried to visit him in a prison hospital. They told me he got shot trying to escape. And what did you think about that? I was surprised Colonel Vail would allow himself to be shot, sir. We had a little snafu with the rehab group. Sir? As you know, Captain, black ops are missions that never happened. The rehab group is a black ops unit that doesn't exist. Its members fly directly to the target then back. They never go off base. Officially they're all dead. So security is never compromised. Except at 0100 hours their fearless leader Colonel Vail went AWOL from Fort Monroe. Colonel Vail is alive, sir? On the last job one of our boys tried to go on vacation. Vail did his duty and shot the son of a bitch. Maybe he's upset about it. PARKER: I wouldn't speculate about that. Colonel Vail and the other group members are close to perfect killing machines. No doubts. No remorse. Find him, Captain. Bring him back. Colonel Vail will not be easy to capture, sir. The mission parameters include the possibility of target retrieval after termination. Are you saying if I can't capture Colonel Vail I should kill him Mr. Parker? Captain, you mustn't allow the police to take him into custody. You are authorized to use all means to avoid jeopardizing the security of the rehab group. You understand there'll be civilians involved, sir? We'd all like to avoid collateral damage, Captain. But nothing and nobody is to compromise your mission. We can't have a media circus. How many men have you killed Mr. Parker? Excuse me? COLIN: Confirmed kills. I don't kill people. COLIN: I didn't think so. I don't see how that is relevant. You just issue the orders and watch the show, right? MAN: Captain. Sir. I trust you, Colin. Don't let me down. Dismissed. [bird cawing] [distant talking] [classical piano music] [door opening] MAN: Captain Neal, sir. Captain Neal, sir. They're ready for you, sir. [door closing] COLIN: Now, I understand you had faulty intelligence. You couldn't get a positive ID on the target. So you just wiped out all the potentials. Right? Yeah. It was real embarrassing. COLIN: Was Colonel Vail upset about that, Major Jordan? Like we give a fuck about the dudes we wasted. Uh-- Major Hawk Kayhan tried to desert. Any idea why? No. Yeah. Uh-- He had to go get a wedding present. [chuckling] Funny. Colonel Vail shot Major Kayhan. Yeah. So? Is there any indication that he may have been upset about that? No. COLIN: Do any of you guys have any idea why Colonel Vail would go AWOL, huh? Maybe he got tired of playing dead. Captain Willard. Captain Willard, do you ever get tired of playing dead? Ah, come on. Look at the advantages. No bills. No divorce court. And every so often you get to pump some asshole full of led. [chuckling] You, uh-- hired the services of one prostitute last night named Jody Richardson. I'm tired of 20 fucking questions. Did she say anything to Colonel Vail? Hey, you looking for a job, buddy? 'Cause we got an opening. [thumping] [groaning] [thumping] [grunting] [thudding] [groaning] [thumping] [groaning] [thumping] Come on. [thumping] [thudding] [thumping] [groaning] OK. Congratulations. You're hired. Whose picture was in the frame on Vail's bedside table? Some old chick and some real ancient guy. How's you know there was a photo? I didn't. Now I do. Asshole. [siren blaring] It's a red '73 Mustang. It's by the main entrance just like you asked. Why do you need to see him, Frank? You don't need to know that. [sighing] Well, I-- I didn't need to know he was still alive either. You know, when we were together I never really had him. And when he died I somehow got him back. And now you're taking him away from me again, Frank. [footsteps disappearing] WENDY (ON RADIO) : Mother died in 1958. The father is still alive. Marine Corps general. Records don't show his postings. I bet the son of a bitch is black ops too. How about the wife, Wendy? WENDY (ON RADIO) : Ex. Loretta. Runs a gardening store about 400 miles east of your 20. OK. I want 24 hour surveillance on both of them. Tap their phones. She flushes the John I want to hear about it. Get back to me. Neal. MAN (ON RADIO): Just like you said, sir. We found fragments of glass 50 yards from where he dropped the vehicle. They fit the photograph frame. Great. Now get the lab to put the pieces back together. There might be enough chemical residue left on the glass for them to enhance the image. MAN (ON RADIO): Yes, sir. [siren blaring] [pop music] Ladies. What can I do you for? Jody Richardson, please. Indisposed. Sorry. No. I need to talk to her, now. 100 bucks. And if you're broke I got some magazines. You can go jerk off in the parking lot. This is police business. Got a badge? Badge? Yeah. [yelling] [thudding] Upstairs. Third door down. Where? Third door down. [thudding] Thanks. Get. [knocking on door] I'm not here. Talk to Milo. Nice place. I need to talk to you Jody. And who are you? A cop or something? You were at Fort Monroe last night. Who did that to you? Did you see him last night? Yeah, I saw him. Did you say anything to him? I bumped into him. I said, hello. Did he say anything to you? He said, excuse me. Did you talk about anything else? Look, I didn't go there to talk, OK? OK. Hey, Mister. Did he you do something bad? Yep. [door opening] Milo. I was just sending some stuff back home. Don't bullshit a bullshitter, Jody. You still owe me 800 bucks for that hospital bill. [groaning] Don't even cover rent. And you got Dick to pay me with. [thwacking] [groaning] That sweet little box of yours. You can bet I ain't letting you take it out of here till you pay me back. JODY: I'll work hard Milo. I promise you I'll pay you back. I want a down payment. Come on, honey. I got customers waiting. FRANK: That's right. You sure do. I need to talk to the lady. MAN: You too? [thumping] Did you tell anyone about this? No I didn't. I didn't tell him anything. I promise you I didn't. Who didn't you tell? The guy who was just here a minute ago. Look, I don't talk to cops, OK? How did you get this? A woman came by last week. Short blonde hair. 30ish. She knew I worked at the base and asked me if I wanted to make some money, OK? I don't ask questions when somebody puts rent money in my hands. This woman? Thank you very much. Take care of yourself. Hey, Mister. Is he dead? I wouldn't hang around here if I were you. I'd move fast. [ignition struggling] [thudding] Good to see you, Colin. Same here, Colonel, but they sent me to bring you back. I can't go back. I've got my orders, sir. I need 48 hours. They want you back now, sir. Just a minute. OK, look, all I'm asking for is 48 hours and I'll be back. I can't just give it to you, sir. [thumping] [gasping] [groaning] Watch the road. This is Moorhead. We've been listening to your damn car for an hour. What the hell is going on? I located Vail, sir. MOORHEAD: Excellent. However, I was unable to detain him. Then don't try to detain him, Captain. Just kill him. Yes, sir. Remember, no police. Sir, were you able to locate Vail's father? [electronic beeping] Damn it. [music playing] [sighing] [sighing] Do you want to tell me where we're going? No. He lost his hat. Do you ever sleep? Sometimes. Bad dreams, huh? I know, I get 'em too. Ah. JODY: So why did you split? Stop asking me questions. Something I have to do. You ticklish? We're going to need a new car. We're going to need some money. I don't want to rob anything, but-- If you let me go I know where we can get both. Car and money? JODY: Uh-huh. Yeah. The police won't look too closely if you take 'em. But you have to let me go. I have to let you go? Yeah. That's depends. Where is this place? Not far. I used to have a habit and a guy I was hanging around with. He's got everything you need. He's the biggest pusher around. He's got the car. He's got the cash. Everything. No, I'm clean now. Good. JODY: See that Caddy? FRANK: Yeah. JODY: That's his. Turn it off. How many are there? Um-- like three or four usually if they're not out selling. Wait for me. [ignition struggling] Come on. Come on. Come on. Damn it. MAN: [screaming] [glass shattering] [gun firing] Please. [engine starting] Please. Thanks for waiting. [music playing] [phone ringing] COLIN (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hello, you've reached Colin and Janice. We weren't able to come to the phone so please leave your message at the sound of the beep. [beeping] [phone ringing] MARTHA (ON PHONE): Hello. Hello? Yeah, Martha. Colin here. Is my wife there? MARTHA (ON PHONE): Yes, she's here. Well, may I speak with her? Martha, does she know it's me on the phone? MARTHA (ON PHONE): Why don't you leave me a number and she'll call you back? Oh, look, I can't give you the number where I am. Would you ask her to call home and leave a message for me? MARTHA (ON PHONE): Sure. Yeah, I'll be calling in. MARTHA (ON PHONE): OK. I'll ask her. Yeah, OK. Thanks. Bye. Hey, Martha-- MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Seen the suspicious person. 24, 23-- Look, Martha, you-- you know I love her, right? MARTHA (ON PHONE): I know you do, Colin. I mean, you know that right? MARTHA (ON PHONE): I do. I know. But it's just-- it's a shame-- Yeah I know. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Enough Peruvian marching powder in here-- - I know, Martha. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): --to build a sandcastle. You're right. MARTHA (ON PHONE): But things-- MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): The perp didn't even touch it. He just grabbed the cash. You're right. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Maybe some guns. Yeah, all right. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): And some shooting. Bye. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Five stiffs. Two shots a piece. Boom. Boom. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): OK, Car 34. I'm sending the coroner over to 642 Aspen Street. 642 Aspen. He should be there in about 10-- 15 minutes. So how long have you been living at the Fort? What is that top secret? Yeah. JODY: OK. You know, I don't just hook. I sing too. Well, what do you sing? JODY: Stuff. Stuff. What kind of stuff? JODY: (SINGING) I don't know why I keep going 'cause my heart just keeps on breaking. I can't seem to find my way back home. Tell me where I can find a man who can give me the love I'm giving. I can't seem to find a love that's real. Except, you know, I get scared, you know, when I'm in front of a bunch of people. Funny though 'cause when I'm with a guy I just don't care. Hm. Well, we all have to do things we don't like. JODY: [chuckling] Yeah. You do what you gotta so you can do what you wanna. What did you do that you didn't like? So that's what you're running away from isn't it? Not just that guy who was asking me a whole bunch of questions. Yeah. You kill people? A lot? Yes. Bad people. You wouldn't like them. JODY: And other people? We're going to get another car. This one is too conspicuous. When you can, pull over. That's good. Yeah. Pull over here. You sing good. [siren blaring] [MUFFLED TALKING ON POLICE RADIO] Well, it's definitely not wise guys. They would've used a 22. Back of the head. Kaboom. Looks like Rambo IV, huh? Nine millimeter. Two slugs per stiff. Hey. Did you not see the police line, do not cross? What the hell is the Internal Security Division? He left the drugs, but took the guns and money, right? How would I know what he took? If he took it, it isn't here. Did he take a vehicle? Look, I don't know what the hell kind of cop you are, Officer Smith. Did anybody see him enter or leave the building? This isn't the kind of neighborhood where anybody sees anything, capiche? So nobody saw him, right? Thanks. [MUFFLED TALKING ON POLICE RADIO] JODY: It was a nice car. Why didn't we keep it? How much further we gotta walk? Keep walking. Cool. [engine starting] Get in the car. Get in the car. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Found the Mercedes. We've got a stolen Chevy around the corner. I bet he's driving that. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Yes, sir. Just got a stolen 4x4 north of Salem. We picked up a driver's license on the street right there. A girl by the name of Jody Richardson. Blonde hair, blue eyes-- MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): You want me to worry about some joyriding kid when a crazed psycho Rambo is on the loose? Ah, don't worry about her, Sherlock. JODY: What's it like? Doing what you're doing? We've got enemies. People who could destroy us. Terrorists. Drug lords. They can't get arrested, but we can take 'em out. That's what you have to tell yourself. You're sacrificing yourself for the folks back home. Then you realize you're not just sacrificing yourself-- you're taking them with you. Your wife, you friends, family. Then maybe you find out that the people they're sending you to kill weren't who you think they were. Yeah, but what's it like? How does it feel? It feels dead. [music playing] I went on a mission a long time ago. Went wrong. When I came back home part of me was still there. Suddenly I thought I was surrounded by the enemy. I started killing. [sighing] I was in my hometown. Do you understand? Yeah. They gave me a choice. A padded cell or a chance to serve my country. So they arranged for me to be shot dead while breaking out of prison. You're not allowed to tell me this are you? That's right. What about your wife? You have a wife don't you? They told her I died. [tires screeching] [bird shrieking] JODY: Oh, shit. What? It's something I shouldn't have done. What? They're gonna know what car we stole. What did you do? I dropped my driver's license back where we stole the 4x4. You what? [explosion booming] JODY: [screaming] [gun firing] What's going on? [guns firing] What am I supposed to do? I'm out of here. [screaming] [guns firing] It's gonna go. It's falling. Just get out of the car. Get out of the car. It's gonna go. [screaming] [gun firing] OK, let's go. Now, there. Come on. Come on. Come on. [gun firing] [explosion booming] [birds squawking] Whoa. [dramatic music] I'm out of here. [suspenseful music] Jody. [gun firing] OK. [bird shrieking] [guns firing] [electricity buzzing] [thudding] Oh, shit. Son of a bitch, Vail. [water splashing] Shit. I don't believe I'm doing this. Jody. Hey. Oh-- oh, yeah. Do you boys get off on this macho shit? Who the hell is that guy anyway? Colin Neal. JODY: Oh, Colin Neal, great. So who is he supposed to be? You met him as a diplomatic. He's not officially dead, yet. JODY: Yet. How the hell did he know where we were going? He knows how I think. I trained him. You trained him? He saved my life a couple of times. I saved his. We used to fish together. JODY: Fished together? Christ. You're weird. You know that? You're really weird. Why did you come back, Jody? You stupid brave son of a bitch. You're bleeding all over inside and you're too tough to know you need a Band-Aid. [electricity buzzing] Sorry about the little mess, Sherlock. Maybe you and this guy you're chasing are enjoying yourself good, but you're not in goddamn Nam. You don't go setting off dynamite on my roads. If you break the law again I'll put your ass in jail. Special ID or no special ID, capiche, Agent Smith? [train whistle blowing] MOORHEAD: Captain Neal. - Yes, sir. - Twice you had him. Twice you lost him. You and the target are good friends-- too good. It won't happen again, sir. Correct. You're off the mission. I'll have other people handle it. I can get him, sir. I know how he thinks. I got within 20 feet of him on an open road with a Claymore mine. I can kill Frank Vail, sir. OK, but take out the girl too. She knows too much. - General, she's a civilian. - You're authorized. Yes, sir. [owl hooting] These smell good. [music playing] [phone ringing] [electronic beeping] WOMAN (ON PHONE RECORDING): Please hang up and try your call again. Please hang up. This is a recording. It's going to get cold tonight. [music playing] [muttering] Oh. Wait. It's OK. Oh. What's the matter, Jody? Why is it that all the assholes who want to fuck you and now the good guys just want to leave you alone? Hey, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. It's going to be OK. Everything's gonna be OK. I'm going to drop you off pretty soon. I know. Jody, I want to thank you. What for? It's not every day I get to play hero. No. What I mean is you reminded me of a lot of things. I used to live around here before my mother passed away. Loretta and I both lived here together and became very good friends. It's a nice town. FRANK: Yeah. Loretta had a gardening store and she'd plant seeds. I'd leave and when I'd come back there would be fruit trees everywhere. God, I hated those trees. They reminded me of how long I'd been gone. You must miss her very much. Yeah. Do me a favor. What? You never did get to say goodbye to her, did you? I'll say goodbye to you. Don't worry. Uh-huh. I think you owe her a goodbye since she knows you're alive now. Not now. Why not? They'll be watching her, that's why. You're a big tough guy aren't you? Getting shot to death doesn't scare you, but speak to your ex-- that's another matter. Well, maybe your mission is more important to you. I don't know. [bell tolling] Loretta Vail? Can I help you? I hope so, ma'am. I'm a friend of Frank's. You're one of those special forces bastards. I can tell one of you a mile away. He's in trouble, ma'am. If I don't bring him in alive-- [phone ringing] Just a minute. Don't look at any of the plants. They'll wilt. Flower Power. Who's this? This is Frank. Loretta, I know it's been seven years, but I love you. Uh-huh. I know time-- been so much time it probably doesn't sound like much, but I still love you. OK. I never wanted to lose you. I never wanted to lose you, but I had no choice. Maybe we should talk about this later. OK, I understand. I understand. I want you to understand something. I didn't have a choice. You always have a choice. Listen, I have someone here. FRANK: OK. OK. Goodbye. Yeah, well, um-- Bye. Um-- See if you can get that straightened out, OK? We'll see you tomorrow. - Goodbye, Loretta. Goodbye, Loretta. [dial tone humming] Listen, whoever you are. You want my husband? He's in Arlington. You bastards killed him. That's all I know. That's all I want to know. Do you have a wife, Captain? Does she know when you're coming home? If you're coming home? Is she willing to cry herself to sleep for three months at a time or is she just gonna find somebody else? I hope she doesn't love you, Captain, for her sake. Because you know what? You can die with not a mark on you. You walk, you eat and you try to sleep, but you're dead. Why don't you just remember that the next time they pin a piece of tin on your chest for killing somebody? I will. [dramatic music] [MUFFLED TALKING ON POLICE RADIO] Nice work, Lieutenant. WENDY (ON RADIO): Thank you, sir. You see that mountain range in the background? WENDY (ON RADIO): Mm-hm. Run a match on all surrounding mountain ranges within 400 miles. The computer should be able to figure out where this picture was taken from. There's a house in that area. That's where he's headed. WENDY (ON RADIO): Yes, sir. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): --parked in the parking lot for a long time watching the clerks. Hey, Lieutenant. WENDY (ON RADIO): Sir? You married? WENDY (ON RADIO): No, sir. WENDY (ON RADIO): Why? MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): --licence plates. David, Alexander-- Just wondering. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Repeat. David, Alexander 780. [MUFFLED TALKING ON POLICE RADIO] [vehicle approaching] [siren blaring] Oh. Get you seat belt fastened. Yeah. Come on. Oh my god. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Unit 39, do not attempt contact. Suspect is armed and extremely dangerous. Tail the vehicle and wait for backup. - Oh my god. - Sit back. Sit back. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Unit 39, do you read? Hope you can hear this. We're in pursuit of suspect. Readying Railroad. We're entering the Reading rail yard, Tamarack Road North. [suspenseful music] Look out. - Look out. Look out. [groaning] They are right there. Let's see if the gate is open. JODY: It's closed. FRANK: Nope. It's not open. [sirens blaring] [tires screeching] Got you, you son of bitch. OK, fat man, I want you to get out of the vehicle and lie down on the ground face down, now. [gun firing] You've got 10 seconds to get out of the car. 10, 9, 8-- [thudding] [guns firing] FRANK: Drop your guns. Drop your guns right now. Drop your guns right now or I'm gonna drop-- I'm going to drop-- I'm going to drop the car if you don't drop your guns right now. Drop your guns out of the car or your car is going down. Lay it flat on the ground. MAN (ON POLICE RADIO): Unit 39, do not attempt contact. Repeat. Do no attempt contact. Do you read me? [gun firing] [siren blaring] [gun firing] [explosion booming] I don't believe it. The son of a bitch torched the barrels on purpose. [echoing clanging] [explosion booming] [suspenseful music] You'll have to drop me off. I would just slow you down. No, I can't drop you off. If he catches you he'll kill you. [gun firing] [gasping] Go, go, go. Jody, go. [guns firing] Hey! [guns firing] My gun jammed. Frank. Frank. Huh? Bye. [train whistle blowing] [knocking on barrel] [gasping] COLIN: How's the water? Cold? Get the hell out of here. [siren blaring] Always a pleasure to meet a fellow law enforcement officer. How are you, Agent Smith? Fine. I'm glad to hear it. I suppose if I arrest you some big shot's going to phone my office and you'll be back out in the street in five minutes, right? Yeah, that's what I thought. So let me explain something. I like to play by the rules. People feel safer when cops play by the rules. So here are the rules. I see you again you'll be shot by accident of course, capiche, Agent Smith? What? [music playing] MUSIC: (SINGING) Tell me where I can find someone who can give me the love I've given. I can't seem to find a love-- WENDY (ON RADIO): Only two ridge lines matched the photo. One's in Virginia. The other is about 86 miles north by northwest from where you are. Got it. [birds squawking] Took you long enough. You're a hard man to get to. How'd you know where to find me? I still have a few old friends willing to risk their brass stars. Brad Foster? Uncle Max? I remember them. They remember you, my promising son the young captain, before all that-- I don't have much time. Neither do I. [bird squawking] [engine rumbling] By the time I got to take the tests it was too late to operate. Chemo, radiation-- nothing. I should've died at Guadalcanal, Frank. My buddies did. The North Koreans shot off my wing over Incheon. Sharks got the pilot, but I lived. [sighing] I'm always almost dying, Frank. And now I'm rotting inside. I can smell my own stink. If it weren't for that Sunday school crap about unforgivable sins I'd do it myself. [sighing] Are you asking me to kill you? You've killed civilians, Frank. Kids. They were the enemy. They had guns. Yeah, some of them. Those were my orders. It was war. You call that war? My father died leading his battalion in the Ardennes. His father, like the Spaniards, Havana. His father covered Pickett's flank at Gettysburg. Vails are warriors. Ever since the Vikings sailed out in their long ships they've served with honor. There is no honor in war, sir. Dad, you've killed men up close. You still remember their faces as they were dying in front of you, don't you? That's why I'd like-- I need an executioner, but kid gets a conscience. I'm sorry to disappoint you, sir. Must be hell having a conscience. Yeah. An old soldier like you-- probably got some big debts to pay back. Haven't got a hell of a lot of time to pay them back. Some how it just doesn't seem good enough to say forgive me Father for I have sinned, does it? Forgive me doesn't pay for all the men who died because of your stupidity, cowardice, your damn fool pride, does it? Forgive me, son. Forgive you for what? Um-- That village, Willamay-- the one just before you cracked up. We got late breaking reports that the main enemy formation had already left for the hills. The source was too valuable to burn so we had to go ahead with the raid. I made it a point of honor not to pull my son off that mission. You authorized that mission? Yes. I figured I'd explain later, but when you got back home I couldn't talk to you. Your mind was still out there in the jungle. You couldn't stop killing so they offered you Fort Monroe. Let you pay for your crime with more murder. It was me, Frank. I turned you into a murderer. What are you waiting for? I'm the son of a bitch that sent you in. Close the circle. Do it! [birds chirping] [knocking on glass] No. You can't pay it back that way. Then what the hell am I supposed to do? Live with it. It's easy for you to say. No. I've been dead a long time. After a while the world of the living starts to look frightening. It's complicated. Staying dead is easier, right? No. Living is better. Living, Dad. Living is better. Come here. I'll be right back. [thumping] [groaning] FRANK: Come on. Come on. [thumping] [grunting] [thumping] [yelling] [thumping] [groaning] Do it, Colonel. You know I would. That's right. I trained you good. [dramatic music] You would, huh? Then where would you go? Back to your wife? No. Straight to Fort Monroe. They're going to have another job opening. Remember, Colin, for every life you take you lose a bit of your own. I'll take that risk, Colonel. You have to take care of my dad, too. Sir? He wants me to kill him. You went AWOL to kill your father, sir? My orders were just to show up. I found out the rest when I got here. It's just like any other mission. Do it. Just remember my dad. I'm ready.
