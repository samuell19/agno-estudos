[waves crashing] [in Italian] I'm sorry, my son. [in English] My Italian is a bit rusty. Continue. Why would you do this, my son? [gunshots] [ominous music] Within your own heart, you must repent my son, for only then will you be forgiven. It is not for me, my son. For only the almighty Lord in heaven offers what you seek. [ominous music] [gunshot] [gunshots] [thrilling music] [thrilling music] [thrilling music] Great writers write what they know. What does a mediocre writer do? Sure write what you know is good for guys like Hemingway or Kerouac, but what about me? Hi, I'm Zane. I'm an alcoholic. [in unison] Hi, Zane. I'm a writer. Or, at least I'm trying to be. I read that if you're serious about writing, you should carry a tape recorder around. Unfortunately, the only things I've been interesting in recording is evidence of my writer's block. Sex, violence, acts of heroism, that's what makes a good story. I don't have anything like that. I do have one thing good stories have, though. Conflict. See, I have a problem. Actually, it's a big problem. It's a gambling problem. There are the games. Well, not so much games as watching two men beat the piss out of each other. [bell rings] [crowd cheers] [punch] [crowd cheers and yells] [loud hit] [crowd] Ooh! [man] Damn! That guy... was my sure thing! Unfortunately, the definition of gamble means there is no sure thing. Being a great writer doesn't mean knowing what to write about so much as where to start. Hey horse, why the long face? What? I said hey h... ah it's not important. So what's with the confessional? Oh, uh... writing a book. You're writing a book? Nowadays people use computers for that sort of thing, don't they? I can't type. You cant type? I've got a niece who wanted to be a ballerina, she's got no legs. [chuckles] Pretty bad odds, you know? My name's Phil. You're sitting here like someone just ran over your dog, you look like you needed a friend. Zane. So what's this book about, Zane? - It's a long story. - Good! I like long stories, as long as there's sex and violence in it. So uh, what's her name? [sighs] There is no her. No sex? No violence? Well then what the hell is it about? To tell you the truth, I... I haven't actually gotten that far yet. What are you putting into this tape recorder? Eh, you know. This, that. Notes on my life. You never know what little thing could be the inspiration you need. There you go, why don't you write about that? What, my life? Sure, everybody's got a story or two to tell. [chuckles] Nobody wants to hear about my life. It'd be too depressing. Come on, it can't be that bad! [rock music in distance] I'm... kinda in the hole for a hundred thousand. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I was in the hole for a hundred thousand. I borrowed some money from a loan shark to place a bet and ended up owing another hundred and fifty. Two fifty large? You like to stick it in and break it off, don't you? You got a plan? Eh, I could always... drink myself to death. This loan shark, what's his name? His name is Giovanni. Good god, son. Giovanni likes to break bones alphabetically, starting with your A-hole. Thanks for the encouragement. You know, I knew a guy once who had the same problem you have. Yeah, what'd he do? I'm not really sure, I think he's dead now. [man] Hey Phil, where you at, man? Cool your jets, son. I'll be right there. It's time for you to make a choice. About what? Burial or cremation. Listen Phil, the drink, I can't... Nah. Drink's on the house, kid. It's funny how you deal with stress. A couple of drinks here and there can take the edge off, but that's not why I come here. I come here to hide. I feel safer in this back-alley bar than I do in my own home. Home. People can still find you. [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [answering machine]Hi, this is Zane. Probably off somewhere losing money, so leave a message and I'll catch you when I get back. [phone bleeps] [woman] I know you're there, pick up the phone. God, Zane, this is so childish. I wasn't surprised when you stopped sending the alimony just like I wasn't surprised when you lost your job. I'm used to certain things from you but this is getting out of hand. You're still writing that book, aren't you? God, it's so sad. You've become such a pathetic waste of a man. The only way you'd be good to anyone is if you were dead. Maybe I should do the world a favor and kill you myself. [phone bleeps] [toothbrush buzzes] Hm. At least I'll die with clean teeth. - [man] You should really lock your door. - [Zane screams] Anyone could just walk in. Comfortable? [pants] Who are you? I asked if you were comfortable. - Should I be? - Yes. [ominous music] You should. [chuckles] Just a gentle reminder. You and I have a few matters to discuss. You know, you're not a bad writer. Thank you. This would make for a pretty good story. A lot of dramatic tension. Great stories are hard to come by. You tell so much. You know, art imitating life. Are you familiar with The Merchant of Venice? Isn't that that place by the airport that sells Italian shoes? [chuckles] Not quite. It's a play by William Shakespeare. Let's consider it a bedtime story from your Uncle Uno. It's a story about Antonio, an honorable man, full of charity, good will. To help a friend in need, he borrows money from Shylock. Now Shylock, he's not quite as generous as Antonio. So, when the debt can't be repaid, Shylock decides to take a pound of Antonio's flesh instead. [chuckles] Life does imitate art. You're Antonio. Mr. G, he's Shylock. And if we don't see half of that money in 36 hours, I'll be coming for that pound of flesh. Do we understand each other? Crystal. [laughs] I know we would. So, what happens to Antonio in the end? Oh, he's saved by a woman. But... I would hold my breath if I were you. It is just a play. Sweet dreams, Zane. [ominous music] [upbeat music] [music continues] [Zane] This is Benny, the loan officer. I know I don't keep the best company, but this fat, pastrami-smelling pig is sleazy, even by my standards. Not a chance in hell. Why not? Because you don't have any collateral. What about the house? It isn't yours. Yeah, it is! Unless you can produce a Holly Stevens to sign it, I can't give you any money. And besides, she already has a lean on it. You haven't been making your alimony payments, huh? Boy, they get you for that every time, slappy. What about the car? This piece of shit for the kind of money you're asking for? Listen, you're the fifth guy I've seen today, no one else will even talk to me. I'm running out of time, Benny. You could always take a shot in the mouth down at Eleventh and Bleeker. Seems to work for the crack heads! That's not funny. All right, look kid. I don't do this for just anybody. If you're really desperate, I'll give you a number. You call this guy, he'll help you. [traffic noise] [chuckles] [tense music] [loud hit] [gasps] Yeah, whatever. Jerk. [tense music] [keys clinking] [car alarm bleeps] [loud explosion] [Zane] Writers are supposed to be articulate and describe everything with beautifully written synonyms and metaphors. Well that's fine, but sometimes you only need two words. Holy shit! [Zane] Yep, two words. [engine revving] [thrilling music] [gunshots] [thrilling music] That's my car, you asshole! [thrilling music] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [sighs] [Zane] It's funny how at the same time, you can be thinking about everything and nothing at all. I had no idea what was going on, but at least now, I had a moment to relax. Then suddenly, that moment ended. [crash] God! Sir, are you all right? Are you okay? I'm okay. Look, I... I didn't see the light. I'm sorry. It's okay, really. Are you all right? Yeah. No, I'm fine. Here's the thing, I... I have money to pay for your car, but I don't have any insurance. I need to get out of here. Can you give me a ride? What? Look, if you give me a ride, we can forget about this whole thing. O-okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. So, what kinda fellow you looking for? Well, let's see. Someone tall, handsome. Who knows how to pour a drink. Hm, one out of three ain't bad. You know, I think you're trying to use me... and I like it. Phil. We need to talk. Two seconds, speedy, I'm already talking here. This is serious, I need to talk to you right now. You're serious, we're not serious. We're having fun here. Honey, go powder your nose, come back in a few minutes. We have some business to discuss. What the hell's the matter with you? What the hell could be more important than to score with something like that? I didn't know who to go to with this, I thought you might know what I should do. Well you just met me, kid. Somebody just tried to kill me. Who was it? I don't know, he was shooting at me! I really didn't have time to ask him his name. Sit down. Calm down. Now, did you call the police? No, I didn't call the police! I mean... Stealing a car, a hit and run, destruction of private property. They'd put me in jail! Then why the hell did you come here? I don't know, I don't know what else to do. Look son, I'm flattered, but I can't see how I can help you. Well why would they tell me one thing and do another? Why would who tell you what? Last night, there was a man in my house. He said they would give me 36 hours before they came and took a pound of my flesh or some crazy shit like that, and then tonight, somebody blew up my car and shot at me. I really don't know how I'm still alive! The shit has hit the fan and you've got brown freckles. You think I can reason with him and... I don't know, set up a payment plan or something? A payment plan? This guy's not running a dentist's office. What should I do? I need a little advice here, Phil. And my advice to you is to get out of town tonight. Maybe you'll slip through Giovanni's fingers. Just start running and don't stop. Keep running. That's it? Yeah, that's it. Thanks. What will you have? [traffic noise] Was your friend any help? Not the kind I was looking for. Listen, I want to thank you for everything you've done. Don't mention it. So... what are you gonna do now? I don't know. Get a cab, I guess. I could give you a ride. - Sure you don't mind? - I wouldn't offer if I did. You saved me a lot of trouble back there by not calling the cops, the least I can do is give you a ride wherever you're going. [jazz music] Nice place. Yeah, it is. It's not mine. [dog barking] [dog barking] Oh, by the way, my name's Zane. I'm Lara. [sighs] I need a day off. I gotta go get something. Uh, what about that drink? Uh, everything's in the kitchen. Ice is in the fridge. Make yourself at home. [Zane] After everything I've been through today, all I needed was a band-aid. I guess I got lucky. My problem is, luck usually runs out. [gasps] [gasping] [ominous music] [loud hit] [man screams] [coughs] Zane! [groans] [groans] - [glass breaks] - [music stops] You okay? I'm doing better than he is. Is he dead? I don't know! I've never done this before! Oh shit! [fire crackling] [coughing] Let's go. What? I'm not going anywhere, my house is on fire! It's too late! We gotta move! [laughs] What now, huh? What comes next? Oh my God, I forgot my bag in your house. - We'll get you a new one. - No, you don't understand. Everything I own is in that bag, my money, my credit cards, my phone book, everything. My house is on fire. I... I don't even have anywhere to go tonight. I have no place to stay, I cant even put gas in my own car now. You see this? Now, I will pay you for whatever you lost plus interest. Just take me where I need to go, I'll get you a place to stay, and in the morning, you never have to see me again. What about your house? It's my ex-wife's house now. So I'm beginning to think that writing about what you know probably isn't the best way to go about this whole book thing. Quite frankly, I'm starting to think it'd be a lot easier to write about something silly like... like cheese. After all, there are so many different kinds of cheese. You're a writer? Uh, sort of. What kinda of book are you writing? I'll let you know when I figure it out. So, before I insert myself into your life, where are you headed? Okay, so now you want to go beyond the idle chit-chat stage and get to know each other, huh? [sighs] I'm sorry, I shouldn't pry. That's okay. I was headed to New York. I've got family there and I just needed to get away from home for a few days. - Yeah, where's home? - Wisconsin. Well, they do have cheese in Wisconsin. So, do you mind telling me exactly where we're headed? About two more miles up the road. What's there? The only guy in the world I know I can trust right now. How do you know him? Alcoholics Anonymous. [chuckles] He sounds really nice. He's not. Turn it over here. [car door opens] [car door closes] Your friend works at a motel? He lives here. Be on your toes. This guy can be a little strange. [knocking] [Bill] Knock knock. Bill, it's Zane. I need to talk to you. [Bill] Open it nice and slow. [door opening] What do you need? The only time you come up here is when you need something. Are you just gonna stand there or are you gonna introduce me? I'm sorry. Bill, this is Lara. Lara, this is Wild Bill Turner. What'd he do honey? Kidnap you? Anybody out there see you come in? No, nobody saw me. You never know who or what's watching out there. How you been, Bill? Still trying to find a reason for it all, son. Listen, Bill. [sighs] I'm in some pretty deep shit. I figured as much. I ain't got all night. Let me have it. Well, let's just say I'm in the hole with some pretty heavy hitters. Give me the facts. Last night, a surprisingly polite man with a gun told me I had thirty-six hours to pay him or else. Or else what? [Zane] Or else I'll be short two kneecaps, what does it sound like? Then earlier this evening, some foreign guy tries to turn me into a hood ornament, my car explodes, she helps me out, we go back to my place, and some other asshole tries to kill me. Is that it? [chuckles] Then my house burned down. That's a pretty full day. How'd you know this guy was foreign? Eh, something he said to me. Uh, "Via Condio." [Lara] It means "go with God." Eight years of catholic school. Why would he say something like that? What'd this guy look like? Dark hair, some dark clothes on, gaunt features, I think he had a scar on his face, too. Is that it? And a rosary, why? Not sure. Let me make a few calls, send out a few emails. I'll see what we can dig up on these clowns. I should have some options for you in the morning. [Zane] What do we do till then? Go down to the desk, tell Vino I sent you. He'll know what to do. Don't sign in. And don't talk to anyone. I'll call your room in the morning. I appreciate it, Bill. [suspenseful music] [Zane] I'm starting to think Phil was right. My life does seem to be getting more interesting. Of course I finally get a day worth writing about and I lose everything I own. Well, on the bright side, I didn't lose any money. Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow. This one? Yeah, that's fine. Hey, are you sure about this? [Lara] After the day we've had, I really don't think I wanna be alone. Fair enough. Cute. What are you thinking about? Just trying to figure out how I got here. A motel? No. This point in my life. Jesus, you really have to stop feeling sorry for yourself. Trust me, it could be worse. How? [sighs] So, what is Bill gonna do exactly? He's got a lot of good connections, people we can trust. And he'll be careful. He's a little paranoid. Understatement. Okay, a lot. But he also has his ear to every conspiracy and two-bit operation that goes on in this country. Do you really think he'll be able to help us? Yeah. He will. [tense music] [dramatic music] Everyone, this is it. [TV sounds] Zane, can you call down for more towels? We don't have anymore. Yeah, sure. [TV sounds] Yeah, hi. This is uh, room 202. We're out of towels. Can we get a few more up here? Thank you, bye. [water falling on shower] They're on their way! [water falling] [TV sounds] [people speaking indistinctly on TV] [news announcer] Part of a fire. But their investigation turned from arson to murder with the discovery of a body. The body, tentatively identified as Zane Stevens, the only resident of the house, was removed just hours ago. Police officials say they found their first major piece of evidence, an answering machine tape in the garbage early this morning. This is great! I'm dead! With this and other evidence in hand, the police arrested Holly Stevens, the victim's estranged wife, just moments ago. When questioned about the surprising speed of the investigation and arrest, district attorney Mackelroy praised the local police force for their speed and diligence. [door opens] That was fast. [Uno] Don't mention it. Mr. G says, if you don't have his money, I'm allowed to use my own judgment as to how much pain to inflict upon you. So, I'm gonna give you a little preview, just a little taste of what I'm gonna do to you before we discuss whether or not you have his money. [gasps] I can explain. Explain what? You've had two days to get things together. You're a no call, no show, soon to be nobody. [loud bang] This really upsets my employer and makes my job very unpleasant. [laughs] Burning down your house. Do you really think you're the first person who ever tried to fake his own death? Whoa, whoa, whoa, trying to make a run for it before we have a chance to work things out man to man? [laughs] Where are your manners? You have no respect for social contracts. Wait! I hear you like bare knuckle fighting. [loud hit] [panting] Now let's discuss the issue in question. The money, do you have it? I just need a little more time. [chuckles] Wrong answer! [violent hit] [gasps] [tense music] [groans] [groans] [violent hits] [pot breaks] [hits the floor] [coughs] [Lara] Hey, who is this guy? [groans] Long story. How'd you do that? Eight years of Catholic school. We gotta get out of here now. [tense music] [Bill] Knock, knock. Bill, open up, it's us. Anyone out there with you? - No. - Slowly. You mind if I change? What's going on, Bill? It's worse than you think. Yeah, no shit. That ape, Uno, just tried to kill me. What the hell is an Uno? Uh, he works for Giovanni. He came to collect. Where is he now? - Tied up in the room. - What? Yeah, Lara kicked his ass, tied him up. I just wanna know how he found me so easy. [Bill and Zane speak indistinctly] [Bill and Zane speak indistinctly] Something you said last night got me to thinking. Does this guy look familiar? [dramatic music] Yeah. Yeah, that's him! That's the guy I bumped into in the parking garage yesterday! Trouble is, he's not with the mob. - Whoa, he's not a hit man? - No. He's a hit man, all right? Just not with the mafia. I'm not following you, Bill. The Vatican. The Vatican? They call him The Bishop. I guess every now and then, God needs to clean house, too. So when they wanna excommunicate somebody, they call this guy. What are you telling me, the fucking Pope wants me dead? No, they don't do that anymore. Why not? We're in an age of a kinder, more gentler archdiocese. They don't whack every priest that doesn't know the difference between good touch and bad touch. This guy was kicked out years ago. He took his job a little too seriously. He made more of a mess than what he was trying to cover up! Murder, torture, he did it all! He worked for the church, but he might as well have been the Devil himself. The church could only take so much, so they decided to cut him loose. And he decided to let them know how he felt. [in Italian] Father... He confessed everything. [Bill] Everything they had him do. All of the murders. Every disturbing detail. [in Italian] Forgive me, father. [gunshot] Holy shit. Holy shit is right, but you ain't heard nothing yet. Guess one dead priest just wasn't enough, like putting a band-aid over a bullet hole. [bell rings] [dramatic choral music] [dramatic choral music] [dramatic choral music] [dramatic choral music] [Bill] Hells Bells. Like the Devil himself. After that, he disappeared. Every few years, he pops up again, leaves a trail of bodies in his wake, goes to the nearest parish, confesses everything, kills the priest, and poof, he's gone. Oh my God. I don't think God had anything to do with it. Oh, you can't be serious, Bill. Dead serious. It only gets worse. Yep. He's not the only one. This kinda crazy shit's been happening all over the world. That stuff that's happened to you, you're not alone. [dramatic music] Look at these. New York, Miami, London, Prague. Man found burning! [Zane mumbles] There's like 20 cities here! [sighs] What the hell's going on, Bill? It's a game. This is a game? Afraid so. Well, why would they want me? No idea, but I do know there could be as much as a million dollar price tag on your head to the one who bags you. Bags me? - What am I, a fucking deer? - Oh yeah. It's a winner take all kinda thing. If you can afford to put in, you can play. In Hungary last year, they busted up two games just like this. Since then, it's been showing up in the States. Face it, your ass has a huge price tag on it. And if the mob don't get you, son, these guys might. [sighs] I think I'm gonna be sick. Look, I appreciate the accommodations, but I think it's time for me to leave. You're not going anywhere, doll face. Excuse me? If that thug found you, it's only a matter of time before the other ones track you down. Oh, I think I can take care of myself. [Bill] You wouldn't get two miles, not without my help. So what do we do? I'm gonna take us out of the country. - [Lara] Us? - Yeah, us. It's only a matter of time before the others come here and they're not exactly gonna be neighborly when they ask me where you are. So I'm going, too. Why out of the country? Lie low for a while until this whole thing blows over. Well, how long's a little while? Four or five years. [sighs] But first thing's first. You're gonna need these. We can't get out of the country with those. Country? Honey, you're gonna need these to get out of this motel room! Ah, shit! [Lara] What? - I left my bag in the room. - Leave it. Leave it? I cant leave it. My book's in it! - So? - So it's all I have left. Son, we don't have time. I'll be right back. You have one hour! That boy's gonna get me killed. [ominous music] Can I help you? [crunchy bite] [gunshots] This is the one. [in unison] Mike Oxmall. [elevator bell rings] [tense music] [mumbling] Enjoy your stay, big guy. [mumbling] [groans] [tense music] [cocks guns] Most of these guns don't work. You get what you pay for. You bought these? No, I stole them. [gun clicks] So how did you and Zane meet? [tense music] Stop. [Lara] It's just Zane. [Bill]Knock, knock. Who's there? [Bill]Balls. Balls who? [gunshot] Balls you, asshole! [cocks gun] [thrilling music] [gunshot] [groaning] [pants] [groaning] [loud hit] [panting] [gasping] [groans] [gunshots] [elevator bell rings] [tense music] [muffled gunshot] [tense music] God, Zane, I'm sorry. There wasn't anything I could do. Come on, we gotta move. [thrilling music] [tires screeching] Come on, open it! [pants] I can't believe I just killed a guy. What's your fucking problem? - I'm trying. - Start the car! [police car honks] Oh shit. - Okay, just play it cool. - Cool? We cant just sit here! Listen, if we cause a commotion, it's just gonna make things worse. [knocking on glass] Good morning, folks. What seems to be the problem? There's no problem, officer. Where are you in such a hurry to? H-hurry? there's no hurry. You two nearly caused an accident crossing the street. - [voice over radio] - One moment please. It's probably about the motel. He may not even know anything yet, just... be cool. Ma'am, sir, step out of the car, please. [birds chirping] Sir, put the bag on the ground. Sir, please turn around. Sir, I want you to slowly back up and put your hands in the air! Please officer, this isn't what you think! - Stay where you are! - Zane, don't. All right, listen very carefully, here's what we're gonna do. Ma'am, I want you to put these on him. This is 1-L19. I've got a possible 436. Requesting backup. Ma'am, step this way please. Listen, you have to let us go! Ma'am, put your hands on the hood of the car. Get in. - You don't know what you're doing! - Get in the car. Stay right there. You know, you don't have to be such a Nazi about this! Now look, I try to do this the easy way. One more word out of you, and I'm gonna do it the hard way. You look. If you don't let us go, you're gonna get us all killed! From what? [gunshot] [dramatic choral music] [splash] Oh shit, it's him! [gunshot] [thrilling music] [gunshots] There's a dead cop on me! [tires screeching] [engine revving] - What the hell are you doing? - [Lara] It's him! - Who? - [Lara] The Bishop! [thrilling music] [engine revving] [thrilling music] [gunshots] [engine revving] [glass breaks] [pants] [tires screeching] [curses in Italian] [engine speeds up] [music intensifies] [thrilling music] [tires screeching] Why did you stop? [siren wailing] [engine revving] [siren wailing] [siren wailing] [siren wailing] [tires screeching] [siren wailing] [engine stops] [engine revving] [tense music] [tires screeching] Well... no more car. [pants] Is it safe to come out yet? Hey, could I possibly have the keys to these fucking handcuffs? [birds chirping] Where the hell did you learn to drive like that? [in unison] Eight years of Catholic school. Look. [tense music] We can lose him in here. [tense music] [tense music] [bang] Hey. The phone doesn't work. We'll try the truck. [engine revving] What's wrong? [Lara] Before we go any further, I really think you should arm yourself. Try not to drop it. You hear that? [music intensifies] Run! [gunshots] [tense music] [tense music] [gunshots] [loud explosion] [tense music] [music intensifies] [sighs] [breathing heavily] Does this guy ever fucking stop? I got a plan. What now? [loud hit] [tense music] [gunshot] [tense music] [groans] [metallic bang] [gunshot] [Lara screams] [tense music] [tense music] [loud hit] [Lara screams] [gasps] [bang] [footsteps approaching] [groans] [The Bishop screams] [violent hits] [Lara pants] [tense music] [violent hits] [loud bang] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] Lara! Lara! [dramatic music] [gunshots] [tense music] [gunshots] [music intensifies] [glass breaks] [loud explosion] [fire crackling] [fire crackling] [tense music] [car door opens] [engine starts] [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [car door closes] Hello? Open up! It's me! [knocking on door] Phil! [knocking on door] Jesus Christ oh m... You all right? [panting] No. You know I don't open for another three hours. I know, but I desperately need to use your phone. You look like shit! Eh, well I feel like shit. And I think I just stared the devil in the face. - Can I get a beer? - Yeah, sure. [tense music] Hey, you want me to call you an ambulance? I gotta check on something. [coin clinks] [phone bleeps] - [phone bleeps] - [phone rings] - [phone bleeps] - [phone rings] - [phone bleeps] - [phone rings] - [phone bleeps] - [phone rings] [phone rings] So tell me kid, what happened? Why me? - What? - Why me? What are you talking about, man? [yelling] Why me? [chuckles] Nothing personal, kid. Strictly a monetary thing. That's sick. Maybe so, but it pays well. You've been running this thing the whole time? No, no, no, I'm not the mastermind. I'm the coordinator slash referee. I pick out the hunters, I select the kill, I secure the purse, various other details, but most of all, I get 25 percent of the cash prize! Come on horse, don't stand there with that long face. You are one sick son of a bitch, Phil. I'm about to offer you the chance of a lifetime. Since you're standing right here in front of me, I assume everyone else is dead. That means the purse is yours! Minus my cut, of course. You stripped me of my life! You said your life sucked! Maybe, but that does not give you the right to play judge, jury and executioner! You stupid pathetic loser, you're the one to come in here whining to me, "Oh, my life's over. Oh, I got a gambling problem." Fuck you. Fuck me? No, fuck you! I don't go out and air my dirty laundry to anyone who asks! You know what? If we didn't put you out of your misery, somebody else would! You don't know me. I know you, kid. I know you for the weak, scared bitch that you are. And I definitely know you don't have the balls to pull that trigger. [tense music] - [pulls trigger] - [gun doesn't shoot] [cocks rifle] [gunshot] [glass breaks] This game's over, buddy boy! [gunshot] - Son of a bitch! - [cocks gun] You! [gunshots] [retches] [alcohol pours] [groans] Twisted sex! [laughs] And I'm on top! Do you know who she is, kid? [gunshots] [bullet shells hit the ground] [tense music] [alcohol pours] I thought you were dead! You okay? Look what we got! I don't think so. We can share the money. The rules don't say anything about sharing. The rules? Oh, fuck me. So you're playing too? Why'd you help me? I don't know. I guess you could say I like to play from the inside out. It's much more exciting that way. It's easy to win when you're the only player left. And trust me... [strikes match] I've been playing them all along. And you. So that's how they found us so easy? By the way, I wanna thank you for all your help. I couldn't have done it without you. Or your friend. Lara... bitch. What the hell? - [gunshot] - You know? It's a shame. I really liked Bill. [strikes match] You had every opportunity to kill me. Why now? [strikes match] Because I like to play with my food before I eat it. [flame swooshes] [gunshots] [bullet shells hit the ground] [tense music] [fire crackling] [cocks gun] [gunshot] [cocks gun] [gunshot] [fire crackling] [tense music] [tense music] There's only one way out of here, Zane! That's through me. [music intensifies] [gunshot] [gunshot] [tense music] [tense music] [Zane] Why don't you just take the money and leave? It's not gonna be that easy. [Zane] Screw you, bitch! [fire crackling] [repeating exactly] Why don't you just take the money and leave? [fire crackling] Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. [gunshot] [recorder] Screw you, bitch! [tense music] Nice touch. Thank you. So this is how your little book's gonna end? Hero saves the day and gets the bad guy? Yeah, that's the idea. I think it ends with me splattering your brains all over the fucking wall. Yeah, why's that? Because I never gave you the bullets for that gun. [voice rewinding] [gun clicks] [gunshot] I rewrote the ending. [Zane] Sometimes, you do your best work under pressure. [fire crackling] [dramatic music] [traffic noise] [dramatic music] [engine starts] [upbeat jazz music] [indistinct conversations in distance] [indistinct chatter] Sir, do you have a reservation? No. Uno, is this the gentleman you spoke of? Yes sir, it is. I want you to behave yourself, understood? Yes, sir. [upbeat jazz music] Good afternoon, gentlemen. What the hell happened to you? [sighs] Lost a fight. So, to what do I owe this pleasure? Mr. Giovanni... Mr. G is fine. Sir, I've come to make good on my contract. Why should I accept this after all the trauma you put me through? I was hoping this little extra would put any differences we have aside. Agreed. It's a nice place you have here. You ever wanna make a bet, you know who to come to. Thanks sir, but I think I've given up gambling. [hopeful music] [Zane] Action, adventure, and happy endings. That's what great stories are made of. [light percussive music] [Zane] I've always heard that great writers write what they know. I don't know any great writers, but I do know this. Sometimes writer's block can be your best friend. [light percussive music]
