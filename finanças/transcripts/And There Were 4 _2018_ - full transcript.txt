(Rain falling) (Thunder cracking) (Sound Barrier breaking) (Sound of wind) (Scholar laughing) - Tell me something Scholar? What is it about doing drugs? - It's the rappers man. - [Thrill] Rappers? - But in the drug addicts' defense, the other day I heard like four songs on the radio about how good sex is when you're high. So I started to wonder, what would sex be like if I was high and I have these powers. That would be hard to defuse such programming for a mere mortal such as yourself. (Sound of Scholar's Mind Control) - Mere mortal such as myself? Mere mortal such as myself? Mere mortal such as myself? Mere mortal such as myself? Mere mortal such as myself? Mere mortal such as ...stop doing that. (Scholar laughing) - Yo, I almost had you man. You getting stronger. Before, I used to be able to hold you for as long as I wanted. Now I only got you for a couple of seconds. - Well, I been working hard to shield myself from such attacks. Sooner or later you won't be able to do it at all, trust me. Anyway, why do you need me tonight? Can't you just mind zap these dudes and make 'em go to jail? - Yeah I could do that. But, I figured Stallion, he's down there and you want pay back for Gabriel. - Stallion. (Gabriel breathing heavy) (Bones cracking) (Gabriel groaning) - I am not afraid to die. (Gabriel groaning) - Really. - Yeah, and plus I could use the exercise. Time to put shoes to dudes. (laughing) - What about the guns? - You worry 'bout Stallion, I worry about the guns. If anyone decides they want to use 'em, they gonna have a mind blowing experience. Trust me. (laughs) (Rain falling) (Thunder rumbling) (Rain falling) (Sound of gate coming down) (Men yelling and grunting) (Upbeat music) (Gun cocking back) (Upbeat music) (Men groaning) (Upbeat music) (Heavy crashing) - Stallion! (Upbeat music) (Men groaning) (Upbeat music) (Upbeat music) (Men grunting) (Upbeat music) (Bones cracking) (Upbeat music) - [Stallion] Fuck! (Upbeat music) Listen, these motherfuckers raided the warehouse. But that bird in your air, and use my cellphone to find me. (Upbeat music) (Sound of breaking sound barrier) (Upbeat music) (Men groaning) (Upbeat music) (Loud smacking) (Upbeat music) (Thrill yelling) (Upbeat music) (Upbeat music) (Men yelling and grunting) - [Thrill] Get up! - No matter what you do, you can't bring that bitch back. (Loud smacking) (Stallion groaning) - [Scholar] What the fuck did you do, fuck! - It doesn't matter. It's done. - Damn, he killed him? Yo, I thought Thrill had a code son. Son, you got to tell me what happens next bro. - Ray, you watching the bootleg of the whole series just wait and see what happens. - Dawg look around man. I get clients all day and it just started. You think I got time to sit here and watch a whole series? Come on yo, tell me what's up man. Come on man, tell me what's good. - I can't tell you. (Bells ringing) (Hip hop music) - [Lady] Hey, are we next? - Yeah. (Hip hop music) - Yo, I am in the wrong business. - Listen here, and take it from me my brother. No you're not. I only know her because of you. She not in here dressed for me looking like that. - Yeah, all right. Look man I gotta go. You know my girl crazy. I don't even have time to breathe, let along cheat. All right Ray. - All right bro. - [Joel] Good looking out man. - [Ray] Thank you. - All right, next time. (Hip hop music) (Neighborhood people talking) - Oh let me run, Joel is coming in now. - Fresh and ready for tonight babe. - I'm happy you're ready. - What's up? - Jessie asked if you could bring the full series over so we can watch all the episodes? - Oh come on Kathy, you're killing me. Are you serious? You are serious. Look the studio has a strict policy on this, you know that right? - Mm-hmm(affirmative). - I'ma dead man if someone tweets the ending. - Baby come on. - No I can't do it. - Please. - No, I'm not gonna do that. What are you? - What the hell is this? - Look I-- - [Kathy] Who's hair is this? - I mean I don't know. Just calm down for a second. - I asked you a question Joel. Who's hair is this? - Can I speak? Look I don't have a clue where that hair came from. - I thought you were going to the barbershop. - I did go to the barbershop. - And now you're fucking around again? - Come on, I'm not fucking around Kathy. Babe, are you listening to me? - I thought we were passed this bullshit Joel. - Kathy we are passed the bullshit. - So you still out here fucking around and not only fucking around, you being sloppy with it too? - I'm not fucking around. Baby please, I promise you, I did not cheat on you God, you keep bringing up this stuff from the past and this shit happened like five years ago. - Joel get outta my face. - Like how long you expect me to deal with that? - Get out of my face okay, I don't want to see you. (Phone vibrating) - Get out your face, well what about tonight? - Fuck tonight, I don't want you around me. - [Joel] It took me three weeks to get those-- - Shh, Kathy Peterson speaking. - Kathy, it's Ryan. How are you doing? - I am doing well Ryan. What can I do for you on this fine Saturday. - Hey listen, I know it's Saturday, but I'm gonna have to ask you to come in and handle the Joshua file. - No problem Ryan, but, I do have plans for this evening. Are you sure it can't wait until Monday morning? - Unfortunately, it cannot wait Kathy. I have a meeting with Michael first thing Monday morning to go over the figures. - Okay tomorrow, what about tomorrow? It's Sunday, I can come in and work then. - Kathy, I was under the impression you really wanted this promotion and you'd be willing to do whatever it takes in order to get it. Now is one of those times. - You are right, I will be right in. - Thanks. - Are you okay, what happened? - Don't worry about what happened. I just need you gone right now okay. And do not speak just leave. - Why I gotta leave if you about to go to work? - Joel! Go, now! - Okay, you win, I'ma go. If that's what you really want. Damn. (Phone ringing) - Yo! - What's up man? - What up snitches? Hey guess who'll be at the fight tonight? - I know not you. - Oh you know wrong. I'll be there at 7:00 p.m. - Really, how the hell did you do that? - I got one of my subs to come in by telling her she was getting a promotion that she was never gonna get in the first place. - (laughs) And that worked? She fell for that? - Yeah of course it worked, what do you think I'm doing over here. You know what when she gets here, I'll give her some of my own work, you know what I mean? - Nice, all right. What about the other thing though? Did you get that? - Yeah I got it. I have it with me here in the office. - Ooh, you have it at the office with you. When did you get it? - I got it this morning, I didn't have a chance to bring it home with me, which is why I have it here. Don't make a big deal about it, all right? And listen, rest assured what happened with that black fuck last month... will never happen again. Anyway let me go, I'll see you lames at the fight all right, don't be late. (Phone ringing) Hello. - Hey Ryan, this is Detective Clayton, how are you? - Detective, I'm well. I'll be doing a hell of lot better if I finally had some info on the man who attacked me. But other than that how are you doing? - I'm doing fine, thanks for asking. I'm actually calling you about your assault. Unfortunately, we have to close this investigation. We only have the description of the individual you gave us and we haven't been able to locate anyone. Plus, the bartender said you were drunk and taunting the man because he was talking to a woman that turned you down earlier that evening. Is that true? - It was late, I had a couple of drinks. Certainly, no enough to be drunk. And I have no absolutely no recollection of any woman turning me down. But what I do recall is being viciously attacked by a black man. - I understand, look if I hear anything from here on out, I'll let you know okay, thank you. - Thank you Detective, you've been an absolute great help. (Sounds of protesters) - My home. - Amen. - My home. - Amen. (Phone ringing) - This is Terry. - Hey frat what's good? - Hey nothing much, how are you? - All is well with me, but you know that issue you wanted me to look into? - Yep. - Well it's been taken care of. Tell your client he has nothing to worry about. - So we're good? - We okay, how we good... is you get Joel to come over here in a three weeks to this party and act like we boys so I can finally smash his chick. - Man you know you bigger than this right? - Come on Terry, you don't think I know this is lame? I know it's lame, but not lamer than your client going down for beating up that drunk ass white boy. Look, I'm kidding, but I ain't kidding. You got three weeks to this party, more then enough time to get this guy on board, all right. I gotta go, I'll talk to you. (People on TV chanting) - [Lady] I'm 163rd and Webster, what you know about that? - [Man On Tablet] I know everything about that. - You don't know nothing 'bout that life. - You already know. - You know about collecting those bottles? - [Man] Uh-huh. - [Lady] Blue, green, and yellow. (Rhythmic drumming) (Rhythmic drumming) (Man rumbling) (Phone ringing) (Rhythmic drumming) (Phone ringing) - [Scholar] Do you see him? - I do. - [Scholar] All right cool. Do you see the mark though? - No I can't, he has on all black. - [Scholar] Well go in there and get him. - Not yet, I want to see how this plays out. - [Scholar] Never mind, I'll make you do it myself. (Scholar mind control sound) - Sorry bro, those days are long gone. I've mastered keeping you out of my mind. [Scholar] Fuck! Look have some patience. I want to see what we're dealing with. - [Scholar] You sure? Yeah. (Rhythmic drumming) (Bar patrons talking) - [Kyle] One of the things about smoking weed is that you have questions that keep you up late at night. Like for instance this one question I had like three weeks ago, kept me up forever. And it was can a Crip donate blood? Like I honestly, I almost went insane over that. But yeah, like I said, it's great doing comedy. I just get to say whatever I want and still get paid for it. Anyway my name is Kyle, thanks for having me. (Audience clapping) - All right everybody, one more time for Kyle Thompson! (Audience clapping) All right, I'm your host Khalia Solano and I've got one more comedian for you, Marlon John Baptiste. (Audience cheering) - How's everybody doing? All right I love being on stage and this the only time you guys look up at me, when I have a conversation with y'all. (Audience laughing) I got a wife and four daughters. It's hard living with five females right, 'cause every now and then you have feminine moments. Like I give you a perfect example. I be in the house watching Glee, like that's my shit right there, you know what I'm saying. My wife come home and start talking to me, you know what I'm saying. This can't wait 'til after the performances, that's my shit right there. (Audience laughing) I had the biggest feminine moment over the summer though, regarding the heatwave you know what I mean. I'm doing laundry and it's six of us. I'm small, homeboy see me, he's like, "Yo, you look like you need some help." I'm like, "I appreciate that." Feminine moment kicked in. I started flirting with him by mistake. (Audience laughing) Listen I didn't mean to do it, don't judge me you know what I'm saying, it was just in the moment you know what I mean. Like it just happened, you know what I'm saying. So he's carrying the shit upstairs, I'm like, "Yo, you look like you need a snow cone, "my kids got a snow cone machine upstairs." I went upstairs made him a snow cone. - [Bartender] Hey what can we get for you? - [Zoey] White wine please. - Got you. (Audience laughing) - Thanks. - [Comedian] But it worked out, it worked out. (Audience laughing) (Comedian performing) - That's interesting. - What is? - That suit and tie combination. (laughs) - So you're gonna roll in here giving fashion advice before you even give me your name? That's, that's a hard sell fake Joan Rivers. - Ooh, look at you... you're funny. My name is Zoey. So you meeting anyone? I've been here for a minute watching you, but I had to ask before I made my move. - That's funny because I don't remember you coming in. I've been looking. But no, to answer your question, just sitting here having a drink. My name's Tyler. - Well Tyler, see I was in the cut, but it makes sense you'd be here all alone with that outfit.(chuckles) - You got jokes. Thank you for brightening my Monday. - You're welcome. But if this is cool for you on a Monday, imagine what we can do on a Friday. - I may have to take you up on that. - Who offered you a Friday? Sometimes a Monday's all you get. And sometimes you have to make the most of your opportunity. When and if it comes. (Mysterious music) (Heavy breathing) (Moaning) (Heavy breathing) (Moaning) (Heavy breathing) (Moaning) (Water Running) - [Tyler] You okay? - Yes love, I am. Can you hand me my shirt? - [Tyler] You, you're not gonna stay? - No baby, I can't. (Rhythmic drumming) (Rhythmic drumming) (Rhythmic drumming) (Rhythmic drumming) (Suspenseful music) - Damn, just when I thought I had a home. (Suspenseful music) (Men grunting) (Upbeat music) - [Thrill] What the fuck? (Men grunting) (Upbeat music) (Scholar's mind control sound) - [Scholar] (laughs) Yo! My man... was giving you the business. Hold on, let me get a picture of this. Wait, wait, wait. (Shutter flashing) (Scholar laughing) - [Thrill] You think you so funny. Where is she? - Where is who? - Don't play games with me. - [Shift] I don't know what you're talking about. - You do know what I'm talking about. Her father is a congressman. She's been missing for weeks. - Like I said, I don't know that girl. - [Scholar] Chill man. Relax yo. It's a easier way to do this. (Scholar's mind control sound) Father forgive 'cause he's a good man. He just doesn't know the error of his ways. - Are you serious? This piece of shit? A good man, you're praying over him. - [Scholar] I wasn't praying for him, I was praying for you. You have to learn to be patient yo. A black man's reaction to everything doesn't always have to aggression. - This coming from a dude that just beat up 15 guys at a drug bust. - [Scholar] Yo, why you bring up old shit man? - I'm bringing up old shit. - [Scholar] Anyway, she's here. He has here hidden there. Don't be rude, introduce yourself to Mr. Thrill. - (Australian accent) Hello Mr. Thrill, my name is Shift. That's because I can shift into anyone. - Are you doing this? - [Scholar] That's dope right, you like that? Now give him Nigerian. - (Nigerian accent) Hello, how are you my friend. (Scholar laughs) - [Thrill] You think you clever? - [Scholar] All right, all right, stop. Go back to normal. - Why'd you kidnap the girl? - Well I move around a lot, and when I do I need someone to talk to. But, I take great care of them usually. But, they have to be beautiful because I use their appearance to seduce individuals I find attractive. - Is that it, the mark? - Is that what? What this? - [Thrill] Yeah. - I've just always had this. - [Scholar] Lead us to the girl. (Woman whimpering) - [Thrill] You wolf! - [Scholar] Yo, yo, come on yo, what the fuck is wrong with you man, relax. Relax yo, he's in the zone man, he doesn't know what's going on. Let him go! - [Zoey] Why did you keep me here! Why, answer me! Why, why did you keep me here, why! (Sound of breaking restraints) (Phone ringing) - Yo what's good Jerry, how's LA? - Yo man, LA is great. I'm telling you, you got to get out here. Hey listen, I know it's Saturday and everything, but the studio just called and asked if you could come in and take a couple of pick up shots. - No problem, I did have plans today, but they've changed. So I'll be right in. Also, I want to talk to you about some other roles Jerry. I don't want to be type cast as this character anymore. I can do so much more. - Joel I know, trust me I'm on it. Can we deal with that after you take the pick up shots? We'll have a little more leverage than we do now if we just wait a little bit longer. - Of course, all right, talk to you later. (Booming explosions) (Thrill yelling) (Zombies growling) - Cut! Cut! That's enough for today. Joel, can I see you over here please. You're costing us money today. - [Joel] I know I'm sorry. - If you didn't have it, you should have just said that. - You're right. - I need this shot bro. You see this, this doesn't allow us to send out mediocre footage. - You're right, you're right. Just dealing with some issues. - You see that, personal issues stop there. - [Joel] Right. - Water? - Thank you. Do you mind getting my cell phone? - No. - Thanks. Thanks. - Anytime. (Phone ringing) - Yo. - Fuck, I got issues. - In other news, lobsters, they get boiled and turn red. Fuck happened now? - Yo, why you always got to try to be the smartest dude in the room Terry, huh? That shit is annoying. - Okay, Joel, how can I help my friend? What's the issue? Hang on, I'm gonna put you on speaker. All right bro talk to me. - I went to the barbershop right to get a cut and when I came home, you know Kathy goes in for a hug. And when she pulls away she finds a blond strand of hair on my sweater. - Damn man, how you get busted like that? - I never did anything. Every since I got caught with Sasha, I been on the up and up, so. - Come on man really? Joel, it's me really? - Motherfucker yes, really. Look the only person I lie to you in your family is your mother when I tell her she's the only lady in my life all right? - That's actually pretty good, nice timing, I like that. All right, so funny guy, you gone tell me why you called or am I gonna have to hang up in your face? - Damn a brother can't call his boy? Damn I just called to check on you. You know maybe to see what you got going on tonight. - I should have known, you're using me, mm-hmm(affirmative). - Yes I'm using you. What you think I called you so you can dazzle me with conversation? You're lucky I'm the only person on this planet that doesn't think you're an asshole and still fucks with you. - All right funny man, so you also are a lucky mofo because you know what, I got tickets to the fight tonight. Just happen to had one that had your name on it, 'til you brought my mom into this. - You see, I knew there was a reason why I called you. Your brother gonna be there? - Yeah he'll be there, why is that gonna be a problem? Don't tell me you guys still have that issue man, please come on. - No, not at all. Look I know he got a brand new uppity negro job clerking and shit, so I didn't get a chance to congratulate him, so I'll do that tonight. Look I know you trying to defend your brother, I'm just asking a question. - Look, you just have your ass here by 6:30 tonight all right. - 6:30, all right cool. (Chimes on door ringing) - How much? - $3. Are you a cop? - Not a cop. - Why do you need that? - Well we all go to protect ourselves. What you don't got something back there? Know your rights old man, keep the change. - How's it going? - [Clerk] I'm all right, how you doing? - Yeah, yeah, good to see you man, how's business? - [Clerk] It's good. - You sure it's him? - [Scholar] Yeah. - You expect me to talk to you with that on? - What the hell man? - Is it him? - You think I want it to be him? Everything I read, all the research, shows that this is the mark. - You know I don't believe in this shit man. - Come on, I'm not gonna argue with you about the prophecy again. Either you gonna trust me and we do this together, or I can do this shit by myself. Look we tried everything and nothing worked, and they still out there taking us out man. - I know, but who is it? You're stay in this Morpheous and Neo shit and keep talking about if we unite the twins they'll protect us. But what happens if we unite them and they decide to turn on us, huh? - It's only one way we find out right? (Thrill chuckles) - You have the other twin, right? - You know I do. - I can't read your mind but if you don't tell me, I'm gonna beat it out of you. - Yo stop acting like you my big brother man. And stop sleeping on me like I'm some easy vic B. Yo I gotta keep this to myself just in case something goes left. They're other mind readers out there more powerful than me. And I got to make sure everything is cool until they come together. - So at what point are one of you morons gonna tell me what the fuck is going on or just take me to Solomon. - Solomon, Solomon is too good for you. No prison on earth needs a man like you in it. And trust me, if my little brother didn't find that birthmark, you wouldn't be here today. There's a lot of rich men that wants your head separated from your body boy. - I'm telling you man, keep it up. I swear I'm a fuck-- - You gonna fuck me, what did you just say? I know you just didn't say you gonna fuck me. There you go with the jokes again. I don't get down like that Scholar. - If you let me finish what I was about to say, I said I was about to fuck you up man. - I'd like to see you try. - Do you mind finishing your Abbot and Costello routine so I can know my history? Thank you. Please continue. - The first known twins are born to Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. She was one of his slaves. Now the prophecy states that these twins are supposed to lead the oppressed to overthrow all governments. History tells us about their son, Eston Hemings. But what it didn't tell us about was the other twin, Nathaniel Turner, also known as Nat Turner. Jefferson knew he couldn't keep both of the kids so he let the mother decide which one she wanted to keep. She chose Eston, and they sent Nat to a plantation in Virginia. - That doesn't make any sense. - What? - Everyone knows Turner was born in 1800 and Eston was born in 1808, so there's no possible way they could be twins. - Why, because that's what you been told or sold? Check this, they didn't keep a record of slave birthdays back then. So if they did, it was for insurance purposes. So the recorded date doesn't mean it's the actual date, you dig? - Okay, I'm listening. - Eston, he had the same powers as Nat, but Nat's was activated sooner because of the stress of his condition. He started his rebellion because his force was making him want to fight, drawing him closer to his brother. But once the rebellion was over, the owner snitched. He told some people that Eston and Nat were brothers, they knew that Jefferson fathered the boys, so they went to Jefferson's plantation and castrated Eston. They didn't kill him out of respect for Jefferson. After that night they started an alliance, making sure that no twins from that bloodline ever united. - [Scholar] Forever. - So Eston couldn't have babies. What people don't know is, Nat had twins before he was killed in 1831 at the age of 23 and not 30. The mother feared that they'd be hunted. So she separated them. Those twins were Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglas. Everybody thinks that Tubman and Douglas were all about freeing the slaves but it just wasn't that. The same force was drawing 'em closer together. So they could unite. - I keep telling that man that's bullshit, because Douglas was half black and half white. - So you're saying that because he taught himself how to read and write? And a black man back then couldn't possibly be genius because, what? Because he was black? So you justify his intelligence by saying he's mixed with white and that's the only way he could be smart. - When does this urge begin? - No one really knows. It's usually around the time the twins start to realize their full power. What people don't know is, Frederick Douglas was killed and replaced with an imposter. That's why he married a white woman. - Okay, you didn't tell me this. Douglas was killed, an imposter replaced him, what? - Yo check this Thrill, there was no television and internet back then. The only source of media was the newspaper. And everybody believed what they put in the paper back then. Especially if they had a picture attached to it. Well shit, they believe everything they put on the internet now. So imagine all you had was some paper called the Daly Lantern or some shit like that. A matter of fact, FDR got reelected for a third term without anybody knowing that he was in a wheelchair. So finding some stock photo of some mediocre negro and passing it off, that's child's play man. - You think you so smart don't you? - You gonna let me finish? - You may. - Gracias. Anyway, Tubman, she had a boy and a girl. Madam C.J. Walker, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Because she was aware of the nature of white southerners back then, she separated them. She sent Du Bois to Massachusetts and Walker to Louisiana. When they got older they were being drawn to one another. But then there was an accident the night that they were supposed to meet at an NAACP meeting. That's when shit gets... sticky. That night while Walker was experimenting with some chemicals, there was an explosion. Chemicals blew up in her face and mixed up with her blood. And after that she became the first twin with enhanced mutant powers. Because she felt like the whole situation was a setup, she cut off her meeting with Du Bois and immediately became pregnant in 1917 at the age of 49. And her twins are John F. Kennedy and Lena Horne. Once she saw that Kennedy came out looking white, she sent him to Massachusetts where Du Bois scouted out the Kennedy family and he was raised there in Boston. Lena was sent to France with the Horne family and she was raised there. - Holy shit. My great-great-grandmother was Lena Horne. - Word. Kennedy, he was assassinated once his powers were activated due to the stress of his presidency. And around that time, Lena start to realize her powers and she was being drawn to him, but there haven't been any twins since. Not until you of course. So why are you really here? - I'm not sure man, I just came. I was watching TV and this force, almost like a child's voice, just told me to come. I been here only a couple of months, though I had a home actually. - That's because your twin is realizing his powers. We got to get out of here man. - Where is he? (Door opening) - Yo. - [Terry] Yo. - What's good? - What do you mean what's good? Do you even talk like that anymore Warbucks? - Please, every now and again I like to use the lingo of the peasants. - This guy. - So I don't forget where I came from. - So uh shit's fucked up now like that with you and Kathy? - I think so man. - Damn man, she was with you shooting in the gym too. - Uh-huh. - But what she's asking you to do is fucked up? - Fucked up, why do you say that? - 'Cause what's the point to being famous, if you only get to smash one vagina for the rest of your life? Think about fam, I mean women know you in Pakistan. - [Joel] Why you doing that? - Doing what? - Doing that, putting a battery in my back. Gassing me to not think about this shit. - Isn't that why you're here, to forget? Yeah, exactly King. - King, what's that about? - King because you are one. Look I got way too many connections to keep calling black men 'niggas'. So I been two weeks to call every black man I see 'King'. But let me keep my thought here. How she gonna expect you, a man who's known in places in the world where they have no wi-fi connection, to be committed to her and only her? Again what's the point to being famous? You might as well be a regular dude. - Word, you right. You're right, I'm a freaking superhero on a hit TV show. And I have to follow regular dude treatment. She is selfish, plus I didn't even do it this time. I might as well be a regular dude. Where's your brother, (Phone ringing) I don't want to be late to this game? - Hold on, I gotta get this. Hello, this is Terry. Yes, yes, that would be an eminent domain case. Right, good old Manifest Destiny comes back to haunt us right? The square footage of the property is 30 feet by 52. Yeah, so I'm just gonna let you guide me on this one, okay. I mean I'm here for whatever, whenever. Don't be afraid to pick up that phone. All right, take care. Y'all good? - I mean I'm good, you good? - I'm good, you good? - Congrats on the new job. - [Justin] Whatever man. - Y'all need to cut this out and let's go. - Yo Justin, why are you walking so close behind me like you George Zimmerman? - What, you scared? - Yo today is not the day man, I swear. All right, I just had some stuff go down with Kathy, I'm not in the mood. (Justin laughing) Plus no one is scared of you. Yo look man, you got your job, and I need my face to act, so it's not like we gone start fighting out here like it's UFC. Talk your shit out, all right, talk it out. What the fuck is wrong with you man? - What's wrong with me? - Wait, wait, wait a minute man. Yo you still mad at me about Sasha? - Yeah I'm still mad. - Oh my god, you serious? - You stole her from me. - I, I stole her. - And then you want to act, - I stole her? - like nothing ain't never happened. - I stole her from you? - Baby bro, baby bro, baby bro, you can't steal a woman. It doesn't work like that man, she chose Joel, come on man. Listen, listen, she's not Solomon Northcutt, this is not 12 Years A Slave. - Man come on. - Yo forget you bro. - Forget me, hmm? The same guy who got you out of that fight shit? - You're crazy right now. - Come on bro, let's just get in the car okay? You and you, in the car. Please, please, let's get in the car. - Go on. - No, I'ma let you go. - [Justin] I'm bugging. [Terry] You stole her. [Joel] And I'm riding shotgun. (Car alarm is disabled) (Car engine starts) (Joel sighing) Justin, look man my bad. You know I apologize, I really had no idea you were dating her too. I've been meaning to talk to you about this but I'm black. You know a nigga don't know how to express himself emotionally. - Come on fam, I told you already all right. We don't talk like that in this car. We are not niggas in this car, we are kings okay. - [Joel] Okay. - You are a king, call yourself a king. - Okay Terry, king, king. Is that better? Anyways, I'm sorry man. - Man we all lose in the game, but... you got her pregnant, made her get an abortion, and when she got it you went back to Kathy. And then she tried to come back to me after all that but I couldn't do it. I'm not mad I lost her to you, I'm mad you messed up a good woman. - Okay, I mean technically I mean you're right, all right. I messed up a good woman, if that's how you feel, look so be it man, all right. I'll take that, but what you rather me do? Stay with her and be miserable? Like who wins in that Justin, huh, who wins? Me and that kid would have been miserable. - So you happy now right, huh? - [Joel] What? - Look at you, you out with us 'cause your girl kicked you out. - [Terry] Wow. - Damn king. Your lips are loose Terry. - You man what do you expect from me, that's my baby bro. If I can't tell him, who can I tell? - [Joel] Whatever. - All men don't cry in the dark. And yo you, you are mad gay for letting that slip out. - Naw, your father's mad gay. Joel had it coming and I needed to get this off my chest. - Oh I had it coming, seriously? (chuckles) Well are you finished yet? Because I'd much rather hear about this story about how this drunk ass white boy almost fucked you up in the bar. (men laughing) Yeah. - Yo, how are you a lawyer? How are you a lawyer, your lips is mad loose. - Right, you want me to cry in the dark too right. - Damn, how long it's gone take her to get home? (men laughing) - [Joel] Oh man, man you wrong for that one. - [Terry] Yo baby bro, tell J about that drunk ass white boy in the club. - [Justin] Man. - [Joel] You got to hear this. (Justin chuckling) - Crazy yo, I'm just chilling like I normally do, minding my own business, and this dude wanted to ... - It was at 10:30 in the morning, so I (Hip hop music playing) was not like, I was not awake. I was like rushing 'cause I thought I was ... - Just go up there and just do it man. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, he was supposed to come here earlier so he could like pass out cards and stuff. - [Chloe] Oh cool, nice, that would make a really yeah. - [Ryan] Hey, hey. - Yes. - So do you want to come back and have a couple of drinks with me and my boys? - (laughing) Yeah, no. Like I told you earlier, I'm fine where I am. - What, no? You haven't even given our table a chance yet. - Look there are plenty of women here that I'm sure someone else will come to your table, but thank you. - (Scoffing) Eww. - Okay dude, it's time for you to listen to this lady and move on. - Who are you? - Chloe do you know this dude? - No, I mean I met him earlier, but I told him I was here with someone. - Okay dude, it's time for you to move the fuck on. - Me move the fuck on? - [Justin] Yeah. [Ryan] Me move the fuck on. - Yeah. - Me move the fuck on, me? Me move the fuck. (Bar patrons yelling) - [Justin] That's when you called your brother to come bail you out right? - Whatever. (Joel laughing) (Terry exhaling deeply) - Kings, we're here. - [Justin] All right. (Car keys jingling) (Car alarm activated) Hey Justin man, my bad. I want to put this behind us you know. Forgive a brother? - Yeah we good. - We good. - But you got to let me know what happens next. - How long do we have to wait? - Man why are you so insensitive? We're talking about my brother here, I've never met this man in my life. Have a little compassion. - Compassion, remember how we found you and what you were doing? And how, yeah there ain't no telling how many others there were. You want me to have compassion for you and your late ass brother, absolutely not. - Thrill... relax please. - Relax, relax, how the hell you want me to relax if you're telling me that's half the team that's supposed to lead us against the oppressors, huh? You fucking kidding me. (Punching wall sound) - It's enough room in this fight for everyone man. He didn't fulfill his purpose 'cause he didn't know. He still doesn't, none of us do. I'll be damned if I don't try to put this thing together to figure it all out. (Door opens) (Footsteps) - So you're my brother? - No, I am. - [Militant] I got a brother man, I really got a brother. - I heard about you. Yeah, all this time you were the one. How did I not figure this out? I heard a couple of times you let some white people die when you could have saved them. - And I did, you got a problem with that? - All lives should matter when you possess the powers we have. - (Militant laughing) Scholar, where you get this clown from man? We'll never win a war with men that think like this. - Who you calling a clown? - Kings don't fight kings. [Shift] Man...this guy. (Militant and Shift talking muffled) - It's brother man. - So tell me, why not save everyone except just saving the black and brown people? - I can't believe you even need a answer for that. I used to be like you. I used to think the more of them we saved, the more they'll reconfigure their thoughts and see us different. More in the shadows, hiding, concealing our powers. I realized that seen the same footage that we saw. They can longer play ignorance to the killings. They kept killing us. That's when I realized that they don't give a fuck. And if that's the case, why should I? The only way to convince the convinced, is through force, not diplomacy. - You're wrong. You're wrong, they do see and they change. It's a hard fight, but it's worth it. - Well, until all of them change, I'm saving mine first. So what's going on Scholar, what are we gonna do next? (Rings jingling) - You gonna put these rings on. Once they're on, you'll merge as one. - Why they blue? - 'Cause they made from dragon stones from the fire mountains. - I thought you were Christian? Doesn't all this mythical mumbo jumbo shit go against your beliefs? - I am always struggling with my faith and my powers. But it comes a time when I got to put down the Bible and unleash the swords. The time is now. (Knife being taken from sleeve) (Flesh tearing) (Intense grunting) - There it is, here it is, two monkeys fighting. This guy got tickets right here. - [Joel] We at the fight. - Yeah. - Yeah, me and the fellas. Come on Terry, get in the shot Terry, come on Terry. - [Terry] What's good baby? - We going to have a good time tonight. - Hell yeah. - Yeah. - [Joel] Thank your brother Terry for getting us these tickets. - Thank your girl for kicking you out.

Your adoring fans around the world want to know, what it's like to play a superhero? - A superhero? - Yes. - Yeah man, I'm playing Thrill. It's seriously one of the best roles I ever got man. I'm not gonna lie bro, the super powers he got and strength, I actually wish I had some of that stuff too. - [Joel] Whoo, the fights about to start y'all.

The original order that killed Nat Turner and Eston Hemings, were called The Guards. And we were started by Thomas Jefferson's wife Martha. I'm a descendant of that order and I have pledged my loyalty to take down any twin of the unholy offspring of Thomas and Sally Hemings. The bullet that killed JFK, Madam Walker, and the others, were made from the same stone as this knife. The same stone that were gonna give you your powers back is the same stone I'm gonna kill you with. So, now that you know are we gonna keep talking or fight. 'Cause there's a lot more killing to do. (Men yelling and grunting) (Loud smacking) (Upbeat drumming music) - He's stronger than I thought. - I could use my powers to take the knife out his hand. But after that you on your own man. - All right do it, do it. (Scholar's mind control sound) (Heart beating) (Heart beating) (Men grunting) (Heart beating) (Flesh tearing) (Body thudding) (Heart beating) (Heavy breathing) (Flesh tearing) (Heart beating) - [Thrill] Our work is never done. (Heavy breathing) (Solemn music) - Thank you for joining us today on the Kaylie Jones Show. I'm your host Kaylie Jones. We begin today's show with heavy hearts as the funeral for actor Joel Spence took place today. Spence played the character Thrill on the hit TV show 'Revolution'. I had the opportunity to play a character on the show, where I was able to get to know Joel personally. The world had lost a great actor. I have lost an amazing friend, and this industry has lost a tremendous talent. With all the questions swirling around, fans are left to wonder, what is to become of the hit show in the wake of this tragedy. - Yes, I have the action figures. I must say that playing with black action figures is pretty damn awesome. I wish I had them when I was young. Yeah, I just came back from the funeral. And, I have to tell you, I don't think they're going to convict him. Listen, I'm a black man and if three dudes came up to me at an ATM with hoodies on, I'd be scared. Two lawyers, a world famous actor, it doesn't matter. Three black men in hoodies at an ATM. That's all the jury's going to see. Anyway, five seasons in the can and the board wants them all released. So let's put the contracts together and make sure Joel's kids are taken care of 'cause the story has to live on. ♪ Big city of dreams, New York ♪ ♪ Big city of dreams ♪ ♪ The birthplace of hip hop and knowledge New York ♪ ♪ Killing for that cream ♪ ♪ you can learn a lot in these streets like college ♪ ♪ New York.
