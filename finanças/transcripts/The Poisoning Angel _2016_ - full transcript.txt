THE POISONING ANGEL Thunderflower, get up. Time to go home. Hélène, not Thunderflower. Throw those away. Get rid of them! I told you not to touch those. It's belladonna, nightshade. It's poisonous. Come on. Who wants a drink? Jean? No? You're funny. If it makes me as dumb as your husband, I better slow down. Cruel child, you scared us. Why did you knock 3 times? I was cleaning my clogs. Any noise repeated 3 times is unlucky. Like the Ankou, the Grim Reaper. He calls thrice, then reaps. He'll say: "Thunderflower, "Thunderflower, "Thunderflower." Then you'll hear his cart. Then you won't be so smug. He'll grab you and put you in it along with all those he reaped on his way. Stop talking about it. Drink. I'm hungry, mom. Too bad. You should have come home earlier. Whoever sees the Ankou will never be able to tell. The Grim Reaper takes him before he can speak. You can never be angry with him. You don't have time. Crack! He just cuts you down. It's no worse than the black dog. What black dog? You never told me. He looked at me and began to speak. He said: "I'm Cambris." It was him. - Cambris, who died last year? - The same. He had the same voice, the same cough. It was him! I'm innocent. Hélène Jégado, where were you born? I'm speaking to you. Plouhinec. Do you have family? Are these your things? You won't answer my question? Is this yours? This? Hélène. And this? Give it back! Calm down! Answer me. You must cooperate. Tell me why you've been brought to me. Let's start over. Do you know anything about this? Whose ring is this? Emily. You're here. Come and play with us. Want to hear them? I hear people crying. Stake hens, lots of them. They want us to free them. - What are stake hens? - Dwarves. They're bad. They're dark and hairy. They come out from under the stone, take your hand and lead you to the old chapel. Come on, let's go. You're lying. That's nonsense. - My dad said so. - I don't believe you. We're not allowed to go to the old chapel. Let's go together. You're crazy, stop! You scare me. You look like a witch. ANKOU KILLS YOU ALL You like the soup, Emily? Yes, Mrs. Jégado. I'm glad you came. - You rarely come. - Yes, ma'am. I'm glad my daughter invited you. You should come again. I'll do whatever you tell me to. Mom. I'm all alone now, I can't keep you. You'll be fine there. You'll eat well. Please, Dad. Don't leave me. I can't do it. We don't have the means. She's your godmother. She's nice. Remember her? I'll give you my bag. It's solid. I made it myself. We'll put your things inside, your Sunday best and other clothes. It's yours. Daddy. Do you love me? Not hungry? No. Then go to bed. You leave early tomorrow. Sir. Sir. Excuse me, sir. You're the investigating judge? Yes. I'm told you're in charge of the Hélène Jégado case. I must see her. So, Mr... what was it again? Véron. Mathieu Véron. She was a cook in your house. Yes. Eight years ago. In Lorient. What are the charges against Hélène? I must know, tell me. You're concerned about her. Why is that? I dare not imagine what binds you, but... This is a criminal case of the utmost importance. We've investigated. Among many families for whom she worked, one or more people died violent deaths. Sir, I must know. Who are you to her? It's hard to explain. But I'd like to help her. Even if it costs me dearly, my conscience compels me to tell the truth. My truth. Hélène. My wife had hired Hélène 6 months earlier. My wife was kind and devoted. What did you serve her? Eel with a sauce. Did you use herbs? In red wine sauce? Never. What's wrong? What's wrong with her? My love, my love. My love. Calm yourself, sir. I'm here. After my wife died, I lost my taste for life. I waited for death. Sir, you can't remain like this. You'll fall ill. Please, make an effort. At least taste it. I can't. Look at me. Look at me. I know it may seem indecent, even monstrous. I loved my poor wife more than anything. Hélène made me love life again, she saved me. So now it's my turn, I'd like to help her, to see her. I want her to know she's not alone. Do you understand? I'll grant that. But make sure she cooperates. Otherwise I'll charge you with conspiring with your cook. Very well. Your honor. Simmer it until the vinegar is completely evaporated. Then, you add a tablespoon of hot water. Not cold, OK? Already hot. A pinch of salt. And then you can add your butter. Then, when your 2 shallots are finely minced, you add them to the pot and pour a tablespoon of vinegar on top. Godmother? Where do the dead go? Well... What a question! I think if you've been good your whole life, like you, dear, you go to heaven with the angels and saints, bathed in God's love. You'll see loved ones who've already departed. You'll surely see your sweet mom again. Up there, she thinks of you every day and watches over you. I'm sure she thinks you're pretty. You look like a heavenly angel. Go on. Go see the priest. Thank you. Come on, help me. Give this list to the pharmacist. Here. Buy yourself sweets with the change. - Sweets for a little girl. - Thank you, father. Go on! Not too many, though. What do you need? Arsenic? What does father Riallan want that for? It's for godmother. She's afraid of rats. So the priest told her to really clobber the rats. Here. It's very dangerous. - Not like belladonna. - Oh yes it is! It's nothing compared to that. That could kill all the rats in lower Brittany. The caramel crust smells so good! Wow! It's magnificent. Congratulations. I might want to taste it right now. No! It's still too hot. Wait for it to cool. And we'll wait for the abbot. He'll taste it. OK, I won't touch it. Careful. More sugar means more fat. Here. Take this into the hall before it stinks up the place. Go on! Godmother. Hello, Hélène. I have a few questions for you. I'm not alone today. Perhaps you've already met this man? Come now. Make an effort, Hélène. Search your memory. I think you had a rather close relationship. Yes. Progress, that's good. Let's continue. Could we say that you like this man? You like him a lot? Look, your honor. Stop. You're shaming her. Did you have other lovers? Just one. It wasn't the same. It didn't count, it was nothing. Kill my brother as soon as possible. My parents sold their lands to pay my dowry. My husband is 30 years older than me. He doesn't satisfy me. Save me. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Let me pass. Give me a shipwreck tonight. Please. There. That will do. I saw you at the chapel, earlier. I'm Viltansou. Look. I set a fire. Ships will see it. Why? We're shipwreckers. What do you want? We need to live. We can scavenge. We scavenge shipwrecks. We can keep it. But shipwrecks don't happen every day. So we make them happen. Come on! Come on, big girl! Give us a miracle. There's one! There! There. Look at the lamp. It's a ship. It'll mistake the cow's lamp for port, It will be smashed on the rocks. You're good luck, beautiful. Join us. You'll get a cut. No. First come, first served. I'm not interested. Think this is wrong? Maybe you're better than us? Yann, don't fall behind. Hurry! It's about to crash. Go on. Don't stand there. I do what I like. What's wrong? Don't you like it? Say something. You have 5 minutes. Give me your hand, my love. I missed you so much. It pains me... I could have helped you, I should have saved you. Forgive me. - Don't leave me. - I'm here. You must confess. Confess what you did. Tell the judge everything. Hélène. Hélène. Did you kill my wife? Answer me. My love. I'm glad to welcome you in our home. Does it suit you? Yes. Of course, father. I live here with my pious sister, Jeanne-Marie. You'll be our only servant. Why is the Virgin stepping on the serpent? It's the struggle between the mother of Christ and evil. She won't be bitten. She's gentle and pure. The meek defeats the stronger foe. She will crush the serpent. Ah, Marie! Our heavenly mother loves us so. We can confess our sins. She takes us in her arms to see Jesus. Dessert will be a vanilla soufflé. Thank you, Hélène. I'll do whatever you say. It smells delicious. Great. You're cooking up another treat for us. Father Lohro didn't die. He wrote a letter of recommendation. Quite strong in its praise, actually. I made sure I served my cookies only to the lady. I see. Why? I had to. I felt it. You had to? I don't understand. What did you feel? Something wanted me to do it. Go on. And no one noticed? Almost no one. Hey! No service today? I don't think so. The cemetery is too small for you to stay in town. Hear me? Hey! I'm talking to you. I don't think Jeanne-Marie died naturally. Small cemetery, but a big mouth. You won't get me, witch. All this is your fault. You have the evil eye. You walk alone at night and speak to the moon. You have to leave, witch. We don't want people like you around. - You scared me. - It's just me. How old are you, Hélène? 24 years old, father. Why? A priest can't live alone with a servant aged under 40. Our bishop forbids it. I must let you go. When? By tonight, unfortunately. It's not the bishop. You're like the others. You believe what they say. Don't be foolish. I heard the rumors and I dismissed them. What are you doing, Hélène? Making you one last soup. No need. So... So, something you really like? Um... You know... No! I've prepared your wages and a letter so you can easily find a job. Go upstairs and pack. And may God bless you. No! No! No! No! Not me, not me. No. He was here. Inside me. In my heart, here. See? I had to obey him again. Yet again. I was the Ankou. You can't understand. To understand, you must have suffered. But I had to do as I was ordered. I opened a door to help them pass, through to the other side. And later on, killing wasn't a goal. Just a means to an end. What end? I don't understand. In front of you, your honor. To be done with it. OK. Go on. I served in various houses. For the Jouaneau in Pontivy, the son was a brat. In Locminé, with Mrs. Leboucher. For the Toursin, he was a doctor. In Vannes, Pleumeur, Hennebont. That wasn't the order, of course. And in Séglien, another priest. I spent a year in Auray with nuns. Oh? - At the convent? - Yes. I was tired of journeying. I needed to think. What's wrong, Hélène? You seem preoccupied. I want to cook for the sisters. Not this again. I told you, we already have a cook. Sister Athanase, please. When I'm not in the kitchen, I'm nothing. I'm useless. My mission is to cook for others. A mission is praying for delivery from evil, fighting the devil, wherever he is, understand? That requires sacrifice. Renouncing far more than you can imagine. Mother! Forgive us. It's awful! Sister Athanase, look! Strange things have happened here, of which I disapprove. You're to blame. Why all this, Hélène? I don't know. Even he doesn't know. It's never too late to follow the path of love, Hélène. Put your faith in him. He, too, suffered. He died for you. He understands everything. I'm evil. It's not my fault. I'll tell you a secret, mother. I think I was chosen. Now I must see this through to the end. I'll pray for you, Hélène. But now, in the name of Jesus, leave this convent immediately. A force within me moved me along, in search of unfortunates I'd help pass to the other side. I brought death. And I saw a house. I saw him. He was as old as the stones. Sit near me, that I might see you. I suffer from a kind of fog in my mind that confounds dreams with reality. I have that too. You? Show me your face. But... But, you are so young. Enjoy it. You still have time. Life passes by so quickly. It slips through your fingers. Why don't you make us some coffee, to warm us up? The kitchen is there. - Is this a coffee grinder? - Yes. What is written here? The name of its inventor. Did you go to school? I spent my whole life there. I was a teacher. I wanted to, but my mother refused to send me. Tell me, how do you spell Ankou? Ankou? That's an odd request, child. Fine. I'll try to write the letters. Though my writing has changed. There! Ankou. Where are you from, Hélène? Everywhere. I've spent my life taking care of the sick. - Until their last breath. - Really? They all died? That's a hard fate. I enter a home and everyone starts to die. That's how it's been since I was a girl. That must be quite hard on you. Sometimes, deep inside, I feel something. I've tried to change it, but I can't. I can't do it. All those dead on my path! That's how it is. And I know my mission isn't over. Do you still... Still want coffee? It's very good. Thank you, Hélène, for making it for me. You're kind, sir. - Are you alright, sir? - Yes. Does it hurt? Hélène, you have my gratitude. Don't worry. I'm at the end of my road. And, in the end, I was growing tired of... May I have these? Yes. Farewell, you who gave me death. Yes. Yes. I fear nothing and no one. Hello, Hélène. A certain number of people will come testify. You realize that, except for Mathieu Véron, most accuse you. Why speak to me of others? I don't care about the others. Don't want to hear anymore? Just say so. We'll stop. I'll go back to my cell and we'll be done. You're right. I'm distracted. I'm interested, Hélène. Very much. I'd like to understand. You spare father Lohro, but you kill his sister. You murder Kérralic, the teacher. You kill some, Hélène, but not others. Why? You spared Mathieu Véron for love? Mathieu wasn't like the others. I do my best cooking when I want to make someone happy. You're so pretty. Sir. You must eat, sir. Really? Why, Hélène? To... to be strong, sir. So you don't die. Why? Because I love you, sir. Why? I didn't understand. Why? Because I love you. You please me, Hélène. I couldn't live without you. I love your soul. I love your presence. I love your skin. You're my angel. My angel of paradise. Hélène! What's going on? Look at me, Hélène. What's going on? What's going on? - Evil! - Enough. - Stop! - Evil! Look at me. Hélène. Hélène. What's going on? Hélène, what are you doing? Making a cake, sir. - You should go to bed instead. - No! Stop! Not him! I don't want to. Not him. Please, I don't want to. Not him. No! Shush! I don't want to. I found refuge in the first brothel I found in Port-Louis. I was completely spent. There were soldiers. Officers, even, with medals. At least I was back in the stream of life. What's your name? Thunderflower. Tell me about your war. I'm here for this. Look at you. Come with me, now. Come on! Hey, upper crust! What are you doing? None of your business! Let me go! Let me go! Go! I don't want to see you. Get away! What did they do to you? You're to blame! You took everything from me! I lost everything because of you. I'm not the same person anymore. I have nothing. I'm here. I'm here. You ruined everything in my life! I was stronger before I met you. I feared nothing, neither death nor men. I was in charge. Now look what I've become. - A whore. - Enough! Enough! I'm here. Trust me! Hélène! Shut up. Shut up! - I'll help you. - Get out of my life. I don't need anyone. Hear me? No one! I owe no one anything. Excepting maybe my mother, who taught me about the Ankou. Without her, without the fear that made her so cruel, I might have become a good servant. I'd have found a husband and had children. A semblance of a life. Becoming the Ankou was to become stronger than my fears. Stronger than death. Fearing nothing. I frightened others, I held the reins. I traveled invisibly, sowing death throughout my life. That's why I came to Rennes. In villages I always seemed harmless. But this was the big city. I was more likely to find a worthy opponent. A former judge, a law professor, expert in criminal matters. That's for me. Where does he live? Near Saint-Georges Bridge. He's a dignitary. They say he'll be the next mayor. I've worked for him for 5 years. Let's go! Let's see your judge, Rose. You sure? He's very demanding. He's already fired 3 cooks. Don't worry, I have talent. I have a good reference. Hélène! You don't look serious. That's true. This is better. Well! The abbot sings your praises... Lohro. But... His letter isn't dated. What have you done since? Nothing. I stayed 14 years with him at his home. I've just left. Excellent. I'm suspicious of cooks who move around a lot. They're always hiding something. You're right, Mr. Bidard de la Noé. Loyalty is sacred. Pay is 40 ecus, paid every six months. Is that suitable? That's suitable, Mr. Bidard de la Noé. I'll expect you first thing tomorrow. Dismissed. Rose. Do you know Hélène well? Does she drink? On days off, employees let their hair down a bit. That's exactly why we should do away with days off. I'll do whatever you tell me. Everything you tell me. Rose. Who is it? Me. The Ankou. Go away, I beg you! Rose, I've come to take you away. Hélène? Is that you? That's not funny. There is no more Hélène, only the Ankou. Leave me alone! You want to scream but you're too weak, aren't you Rose? It hurts. Your time has come. That's all. Come on, open up! Stupid doctor. With his leeches and poultices, he's ignorant. The truth is you won't survive the night. What's going on up there? Rose! Rose. Rose! Oh my God! Rose. Sir. What's going on? I'm confused. It all happened so fast. I came yesterday for her stomachache and vomiting. I prescribed tea. That seemed to calm her. She seemed better when I left. What do you think? Perhaps she fell and hit her head. She has a lump on her head. Shut up, Hélène. What about the swelling of her legs and throat? It's a mystery. It's definitely mysterious. What do you mean? Last night I heard strange sounds. I thought it must be the Ankou, coming for her." The Ankou. Imagine that! Brittany's fairy tales have made you mad, Hélène. Mock me if you like. But chances are, Rose was poisoned. I thought about that. Is there rat poison around that could have fallen into her food? What? Poison. Or arsenic she could have swallowed. I liked Rose. Like the maid at the hotel I used to work at. You worked in Rennes before? I thought you came from a church. I didn't mention it. I was there only 3 days. The maid there died too. Death seems to follow me. It's unfortunate. That's how it is since I was born. I live amid shadows. Ah, Hélène! Stalwart and dauntless, the soul of dependability. I'm lucky to have you in my service. Don't be surprised, I really think so. You're very precious to me. Yes! You're healthy. Not like that poor Rose. I've been thinking. I think you're right. Death follows you. Strange, right? How do you explain that? I am the brown goat, sir. But... please explain. What does that mean? I'm immortal. Ah! You're immortal. That's your secret. How silly of me! Of course. Let's see. Appetizing. A cold soup... Tomato soup. Better and better. Very unusual. Great idea, Hélène. Why don't you eat it? Go on! Please, eat. Hélène. I searched your room. And I found a vial. A small vial, under the pillow. Very obvious. Almost on purpose. So I gave that vial to doctors for analysis. Good thing, right? I'll ask you to please wait with me a while for their conclusions. Hélène, no! Let go! Let me go! The rest, you know. All this led me to you. Tomorrow I'll tell you about my godmother and Emily. Speechless? Answer me. You already told me about that. And you know it. There won't be a tomorrow. What are you saying? Why? It's over. You won't see me again. I don't want that. You can't do this to me, you can't abandon me. I listened. I'm just doing my job. I'm sorry. My role ends here. But... what happens now? You'll be judged. But I won't be in court. I'll brief the prosecutor and he will decide whether you'll be indicted. It's out of my hands. I can't help you. I trusted you. I thought you'd understand. Don't abandon me. It's not over. Right? I want to stay here. I want Mathieu. I must tell him about his wife. No! No, let go! No! Tell him. Please. Promise me you'll tell him I'm sorry about his wife. I beg you. Have no fear. God's mercy is infinite. If you repent, he'll forgive your sins, Hélène. The Gospel says: "If a man has 100 sheep "and one goes astray, "will he not leave the 99 others on the mountain "to seek out the lost sheep? "And if he finds it, "Amen, I say unto thee, "he rejoices "for finding his one sheep, "more than for the 99 others who were not lost." Your Father in heaven doesn't want a single of his sheep to be lost. Don't be afraid, Hélène. He won't abandon you. He'll come for you. Hélène Jégado was guillotined in Rennes on February 26, 1852
