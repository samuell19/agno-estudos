INA presents Image-Changing Nine minutes, thirty seconds. It would be good if you went farther. Farther than what? We just expect a bit more, finally. After... this. How to convey an image of change. Well, to be honest, we're in something that's... To give an idea of change through an image. We don't even know if... Is there an image that can show the idea of change? Can an image even qualify as something that conveys the notion of change? Can an image... Can an image change? Why did I even do all of those discussions on television on the topic of reform, which get on my nerves... At the same time there was something that I had to-- which is why I was so late, it was... Basically, I need to feel, to show how I'd been humiliated. Why? To show myself humiliated? Because there is something in the image that is... I don't know what the sin is, it's very connected to the text. All of these discussions taking place right now are discussions about text. No one is making images. So to go farther, well, I might have said to you, "Fall even farther." - Fall even farther. - Fall even farther. We speak about an image as divine but perhaps it's more but might rather come from the devil and for me... After all a deal had been made. And as a civil servant there was nothing better for the Kingdom of National Television, who had called him, day and night for about three or four months. What determined taskmasters they were. Would the bosses be able to show him off for the anniversary of the takeover of this Kingdom of National Television? And for our idiot, who would mistake easily the work of research with the research of work, this imbecile was trapped in his own game. A nasty business. Like usual, when non-fiction gets mixed up with fiction. You either have to give back the money, or in five minutes you need to create the images, the sounds, the power, the dreams, well, all of humanity's most profound desires, whether good or bad. After looking in deep reflection into an old mirror that the director of Beauty and the Beast had given him, maybe the best would be to buck up, our idiot was telling himself. After all, it was about establishing a delicate formula that could be seen rather than spoken, or spoken without ever having been seen. So, at the same time, both invented and copied. It was true that this idiot's entire life had been no more than a sorry back-and-forth between an image of life, and the life of images. Very soon, he had shown that there was no image, but only chains of images, and that the way in which we connect the chains, from DNA to the R5 assembly line at the Renault Factory, was itself a kind of image. Was in a certain way, an image of the idea we had of how to insinuate ourselves at the center or the edge of the Universe. And this task, all of a sudden, this figure-8 imposed on this imbecilic skater, who only loved free-form skating, brought back to him the memory of a real adventure that had happened three or four years ago, in what we call a "new" country, in South America or Africa, where he had been invited for his so-called affection for this type of country, and also as an expert on how images change, having been invested recently with the power to create a new kind of television. But here is what happened, and what could have happened, which is what, in fact, happened. Or, as our idiot had said often enough, mixing the real with the imaginary, like many people in other times might mix love with work. Two weeks after his arrival in the country, and after he had started to work, there were obviously the usual ups and downs, this new country having forever had its preconceived ideas on the role of television. Then, as our idiot began his work with great enthusiasm, those who had lost power regained it, and banished everyone, including experts and advisors from Europe and elsewhere except for one. Our idiot. The new government was half-military, half-civilian-- civilian at heart and military for the uniform, or vice versa. The new bosses, in general, and especially the Head of Information and Communication, as he loved to tell journalists, this one would have thought that our idiot was the only one who knew how to make television that can serve the public without offending the powers that be. Hence, that would please the government without harming the people. Basically, the new chief decided that this idiot was able to deliver the right formula to make television, or the formula of a good television. He had done the same for those who had brought him into the country and in any case, had already spent the money on his ticket. As soon as possible, they assigned to our idiot a former local reporter who spoke some French and had been promoted through the ranks, and was now part of the army's public relations arm. Those had joined forces with the Public Health Department. These new leaders wanted to work for the good of the people at all cost. And this is how two or three times a day, with the strategic use of animal psychology and human pressure, our idiot was asked what the exact formula was for changing images and the image of change. That in this movie, the prisoner and the victim, which is you, had written a letter to his beloved... Yes, I had started with that, but there were so many ideas in it that... The image of change, change which is so vast, it's everywhere. And in ten minutes they gave me twelve minutes then took back two-and-a-half. Admittedly, I took my time as well. So then there is quite a lot of material. As a matter of fact, there was the idea of two texts. Two texts, one text to his beloved somewhere. Whether it's the revolution, or whether from a woman to a man, all the texts would be considered like a letter to the beloved. Whether it's St. Theresa of Avila or Marx and Engels, it would be a letter to a beloved one. And I had simply thought because we show on television, we always show victims, like in photographs, we never see the soldiers shooting, we only see their backs. Like that. So, I had this idea to be humiliated because, if you want in my opinion, both television and film are occupied by the enemy. The government being the principal enemy and servant as well. Really, a television technician, for me, is a collaborator like the French collaborators who cooperated with the enemy. And apart from that, the desire to show that to create an image is to maybe give slaps but to be slapped as well, that we had to receive slaps just as we got to give them. And that there was a real desire to feel oneself in occupied territory and well, I had, I had wanted to mix different things. I would have liked to create the role of an executioner writing his beloved from wherever he was, somewhere with his garrison, something like that. And then the other prisoner would be writing about the same kind of letter. And, we would have combined the two texts and maybe that would have created the image. There is so much to show. Show the resistance, show the resistance of the image to change. Myself, I believe that I am only the image, and that I am not ready to change, just like that. On the other hand, I think that in between the images we can change, that's what we need to show, this in-between. It reminds me of when I was little, of my grandfather driving around, and only using the first gear. We were little, in the back seat and every one of these Sunday drives was awful. From the back, we'd cry out, "Change Grandpa, change! Change, Grandpa, change!"
