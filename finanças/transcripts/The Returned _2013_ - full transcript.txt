Yes, my wife, as usual. Good morning. Thanks. RETURNED UNIT -Hey, how you doin'? - Hello Doctor. - Hello. - How you feeling? - Look up to me. - So, we doing okay? - Yeah, it's okay. Hello, sir, you look better this morning. - Yeah, I slept alright. -Hey, how you doin' Paul? -I'm okay. - Okay, I think you're down, I think he's like a fifty. - Alright. Good morning. - I have a secret for you. - What? - You're gettin' out of here. - Really? - They're here for you. - Yes! - You happy? - I'm sad.... - I'm gonna miss you. - Are you gonna miss me? - Of course I am. - Okay, be good. - Yes. - Okay, so you just have to be careful with the blood, if he gets in an accident, hurts himself in any way, just make sure you wear gloves. - Do we need to take any other special precautions? - Same as any other kid his age. - The same? - He has to inject himself with that stuff every day of his life, and if he doesn't... - He has to. - Hey, when you brought him in last week, you would have been relieved with this outcome. - Becoming one of the "Returned" is a privilege, it's not a curse. - Don't patronize me. - I'm just trying to help. - Well, you can't help me, - Okay? Because you have a fucking clue what it feels like to love someone with this. - Is it true what they're saying doctor? - That there's hardly any stock left, and they can't make more? - That's a ridiculous rumor. - Your child has been saved, go home and have fun with him, just don't worry about this. - Thank you. - Alright. - Mark. - Come on. - No, it's way too difficult for me, sir. - It's too hard. - You can do it, have faith, get up here. - No, really. - I look like one of the returned, every time I try I'm like.. ..with the shaky hands. - Alright, let's get out of here, then. - No, I just meant... - Get out. - Alright. - Okay, okay, remember your pentatonics and ... ... yeah, have a good night all, rock on. "DEATH TO THE RETURNED" - Good night. - Hey Kate. - Hi. - You know, I'm not gonna give you a raise no matter how late you stay on Friday. - Oh, I know. -so, Joanne says that the boy's parents are really worried. - Yeah, obviously. - Did you tell them, not to worry? - What else could I tell them? - Yeah. - Well, take care of yourself, Kate. - When was the last you ate? - See ya. - Have a good weekend. - How's it going out there? - Different day, same bullshit. - Jesus... - Sorry. - Thanks. - Hey. - Thank you. - Here. - Thanks, have a good weekend. - Likewise, take care. - The situation is getting more complicated by the minute. - Previous demonstrations against the returned were tipically seen at rehab centers now we're seeing direct attacks all over the city. The latest attack, took place at the Castle Frank area where in broad daylight, the returned was assaulted by two masked assailants. This is not the first time that these types of incidents have occured, but the tension generates... - Oh my God, it smells amazing in here! - Well, let's hope it tastes that good. - I got five more. - Five? - You smell good too. - Can you put 'em in for me? - They're gonna be here soon. - What time are they coming? - In about twenty minutes or so. - My God, that's amazing, well I mean, that's just a couple reviews, right, so we just... - Okay, alright, well just, just let us know, we're here, you can reach us all weekend. - Okay, take care. - What was that? - Oh, my God. - What, did you win the Pulitzer or something? - This woman is going on a national book tour. - That's what he said, what we talked about... and a couple reviews have come out. - What? And they're good? - Baby.. - Oh my God. - Okay, okay, wait, wait.. - You can't do this, and not tell us what this one is about. - At very least you need to tell us how many times the word 'lusting' appear in this one. - Because we have money on it. - Yes, funny. - We have money on it, come on... - You know, actually, this is the story of a guy who finds death inconceivable. - He's crazy, he just can't believe that it will happen, and he's sure there'll be some kind of exception for him. - That he won't die. - Yeah, and when the moment comes, he will somehow escape, that something will happen, and it will save him. - That is wishful thinking. - I know. - Until one day, at a routine checkup, they discover a tumor. - No doctor gives him more than four months to live. - Shit! - The guy takes it personally, as if fate were insulting him. - So he decides he is gonna go with a bang. - Murdering one person every day. - That's awesome, right? - It's sadistic. - Yeah, but what for, why? - He thinks that if he has a deliberate and direct contact with death, then he'd be able to understand it. - And does it get him anywhere? - Of course not, he ends up in the ground like everyone else. - Still none the wiser. - That's why I love my wife, she used to write romance novels, but she's really the most dramatic person on the face of the earth. - Congratulations baby, I love you. - I love you. - That's an interesting story, a little sadistic for my taste. - But it's strangely fitting with the motive of bringing you guys over for dinner tonight. - What's wrong? - Don't worry, I don't have a tumor. - Okay, thank God for that. - Your own story coming true is any author's nightmare. Well, depends on the story though, right? - What's up? - I was walking down the street one day, and that's when I saw it. I never thought I'd find that guitar, but there she was. I was so sure it was my lucky day. - Hello? - No one was behind the counter, I guess i should have left. But I didn't. - Hello? I saw this man. - Oh shit! Hey, hey! Buddy, come on! I thought he was having a seizure, so I went down and tried to help, but, took my wallet and put it in your mouth so he wouldn't bite his tongue and he just.. ..he just nicked me a bit with his tooth. - It was just a scratch, but sometimes, small things can grow. - Emergency services, how can I help you? ... Yeah, I don't know, I think I could have it. - And what symptoms do you have, sir? - Could you give me your name, please, sir? - Alex Green. - The military took me to one of these mobile hospitals. - I saw bodies in the hallway there. - Some of them had been shot, point blanc in the head. I guess I opened my eyes too soon. I don't know how many hours I was tied to that cart, not knowing if I would ever get out of that hole. - He told me you woke up on the way here? - Well, forget what you saw, that tranquilizer is strong enough for an elephant and it causes patients to hallucinate. - We have the results, that shit is not going to kill you. - You know? Every time that first dose doesn't work, it kills me. - So congratulations son, you almost didn't make it. - Then they moved me to a civilian hospital. And that's where I met Kate. So... ... six years ago, I was returned. I wanted you to know because it might be true that the stocks are running low this time. I thought, you should know. - Thanks. - See you next month. Let's get out of here! - Hey, get back here! - Please don't hurt me! I wanna be normal! Don't hurt me. -If a returned isn't injected within 36 hours, the spread of the virus in the body becomes irreversible. These statistics are indisputable, there is not a single case that proves the opposite. And we all know the consequence that comes with that. - Now, we don't have any official figures relative to the first outbreak. - But almost all of us have experienced at least one case firsthand. - However, we believe that there were more than a hundred million deaths worldwide. - That outbreak cannot be compared with any other human tragedy in modern history. - That trauma is what pushed us to start looking for a solution. And ten years later, the return protein, was the enormous prize with which humanity was rewarded. And that is why, after the inevitable second outbreak we were able to save so many people. A returned is someone who has had the immense misfortune to have contracted the virus, but at the same time, the immense stroke of luck to have been treated within the first few hours. Now, as you all know, the virus never goes away. We can't cure it. Yet. But these days, at least we can control it, if we get there in time. The return protein works as a barrier, it's kind of like a retaining wall. The incubated virus is always there, but the daily dosage keeps it at a safe distance. The problem with the lack of natural protein, will end with the creation of a synthetic alternative. This way the infected would be guaranteed the treatment for life. For the returned, of course, but for society, as a whole. - Yes, but there's 2 things you've neglected to mention, - Please, enlighten us, everyone is welcome to speak here. - You're very kind. - These people. Are time bombs. Until we find the synthetic protein, they're a menace. If they miss just one dose, what? There's no going back. - Which is exactly why we need to keep researching. - Right, and this is a very expensive treatment, that they have to maintain, their entire lives! - Yes, I am not denying that, but facing another epidemic like we had 20 years ago... - There are alternatives. -...Would be much more costly for everyone. - There are alternatives. - Please share them with us. - They could be made to live in special compounds, outside of the cities, away from the children. - Or we could eliminate them. - I never said that. - But you're thinking it. - And, while we're at it, why don't we get rid of smokers, and diabetics, and the obese while we're at it. I mean aside from costing us a whole lot of money, they're also really unsightly. - Well, that was... different. - Too rude? -No, no, no, you've just called him a fat idiot. - He was an idiot, who happened to be fat, and now I look like I'm prejudice against fat people. - Yeah, amongst other things. - Do you think they'll send money? - What? The fat idiot? No. - Screw him, come on, everyone else will send something because you were terrific, okay? - Correct me if I'm wrong but the natural protein can only be extracted from the spinal fluid of infected people who have already died. Thankfully, there are a fewer returned, But that also means there are fewer sources from which we can cultivate the protein. - Exactly, this is a vicious circle, so fewer returned equals fewer supplies of protein. This has led to mandatory restrictions on access to treatment, the consequences of these restrictions, are what most concern the authorities, especially after the tension of the last few weeks. - Hi, just give me sixty, please - My dad is inside, he'll take the payment - Sixty. - Yes, it is. RETURNED - Thanks. - Alright, beautiful people, go make beautiful music. I have a night shift, there's dinner in the oven. I love you. - Damn, middle of the night, I can't get used to the shift. - It's not so long now, it's three your shift is almost over. - See you later. - They're perfect. I mean, I think Tristan and Josh are gonna be going home soon. - I hope so, Josh has been here for a long time. - Where the fuck are you going? Get against the wall. You! Over there. Come on, come on! - You, nice and quiet, it's got nothing to do with you. - Here, take it. - You've got to have some fuckin nerve to take care of those zombies, haven't you? What's with all the tears and trembling? -They're not zombies, they've been returned. - What did you say? You listen to me bitch, 'cuz you don't seem to be speaking my fuckin' language. They're zombies. Got it? - They're not. - They fuckin' are, say it again. -I'm telling you, they're not zombies. And I'm fuckin' telling you they are. Fine, I'll put a fuckin bullet in your head, say it! -They're Not. - Forget about them! We gotta get out of here! - Your lucky day. - Do not fuckin move a muscle, you got it? - C'mon, lets get out of here! - Who's in charge? - I am. God, I have.. I've never seen anything like this. - There's a first time for everything. Unfortunately. Let's see what we will find on these cams. - I already told you they were wearing ski-masks. - Those vultures from the press will be here soon. There is nothing they like more than a good bit of fresh meat. Go home. - Yeah, thanks. - Hey, what's going on? - Baby, baby, shh, it's okay, it's okay babe, it's okay. - It is multiplatform, that much we know already, and you're lacking leadership, however, there are many people that would like you to be a bit more empathic in your condemnation of these acts. - The anti-returned platform condemns the criminal acts such as the one last night, and we always have. - Yes, but never before have we seen an act of this magnitude. - What do you think is the cause for the increase in these attacks? - Fear. - And fear justifies such barbaric acts? - Don't put words in my mouth. Now, it's true, that the Health Service controls the majority of the returned, but we also know there's cracks in the system. There's a marginal group outside the medical control like homeless people for example. - And those intolerant to the protein. - Yeah, like those, exactly. Remember what happened when that infamous returned with no warning decided to stop taking his daily dose? In less than 24 hours that man with no treatment attacked five people. They all had to be killed. -You're a psychopath, you're a suicidal psychopath... - Do you think one person in a thousand people justifies... - Jesus... - It's okay, it's okay... - Well, how long a break? - A month. - A month? Kate , I need you, you're my best damn doctor. Please at least tell me you're not taking a break from the fundraising conferences, okay? Please. - No, I'm not taking a break from those. - Thank God. - Are you kidding me? - The girl from the clinic wants me to meet her at her home address. She says it's safer there. But she lives fuckin' miles away. - Want me to go with you? - No, I think it's better if I go alone. I don't want people knowing about you, especially not now. - Hey, do you know where to find the building manager? - Yes, just up those stairs, apt No.4, it says "Manager" on the door. - Did anyone see you come in? - No. I mean, I don't know, I didn't check. - Well, can you please check next time, just in case. Yeah? After the attack the other day, things have gotten much worse at the hospital. So I don't think it's a good place for two classy women, like us, to do business anymore. - Isn't there any more? I mean, the money's not a problem. - Yeah, but if I take too much, they'll notice when I'm doing the inventory. I can only really take very few at a time. We haven't received the stock from the lab this week. - What? - The other hospitals haven't received theirs either... - How much do you have in the reserve? - 'Bout a month's worth. - Can you get me some more next week, please? I'll pay whatever. Please. - Okay, I can't guarantee it but I'll try. It will cost you four times as was now. - I told you the money's not a problem. - Fine, give me a few days. - Thank you. - Are they for you? Are you one of the returned? This fucking bastards didn't just kill them, they took the registers too. - With all the patient's records? - They took the hard drives too, there were home adsresses in those files, telephone numbers. Everything they need to fuck you up bigtime. So if you are one of them, please watch your back. Thanks. - Hey, bud. - What are you doing here? - Stalking you. - What's with the glasses? - You like 'em? - I do, very sophisticated. - Well, I wouldn't want people to think I was sophisticated. Only for show, anyway. -You're kidding, you've become that guy? - I am that guy. Wanna go for a drink? - Always. - Spendler, down there. - Spendler? You got it. - So, how is Kate? - So, so... She's taken some time off work after what happened the other day. It's just too hard. But she is stronger than she looks. I'm a lucky man. - Both lucky men. - True, but you're a rich lucky man. - What's this for? - What's it for? - I don't know, you know... I've known you for 25 years, and you told me that the other day and I didn't give you a hug, so... - It's been shit not being able to tell you, man. - Okay, I just want you to know that, you're still the same guy to me, okay? You're still the same shit who put a BB in my leg, all those years ago... - You fuckin' deserved it. - I know, but whatever. Anyway the point is, that, I don't care, I don't care what happened to you, I don't care what this is, I'm always there - Thanks man. Cheers. - Oh my God! - Oh God, look! - He said, he needed to check something. - Are you okay? It's okay. - Get rid of this. - We should call the police. -We can't, okay, they'll ask questions, they will pull the thread. - It's not a fucking crime to be returned. - Yeah, but it can be a problem right now, okay? Just... Go! - There's been a huge deal of media interest, surrounding... ...the health minister's upcoming press conference. Where it is suspected that the official announcement regarding the temporary suspension in the returned protein supply will be made. - There's no cause for the returned to be alarmed, the cut in the supply is temporary, and all the state's resources are functioning perfectly. Our official installations have been specifically designed for such emergencies. and guarantee, that all the affected will receive the attention they deserve. The announcement has left the general public reeling in fear that this decision will lead to a new uncontrollable outbreak, and place the government firmly in the spotlight. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to participate in demonstrations, which are taking place in all the major cities. Looting of several of the protein supply centers on fires, provoked by anti-returned groups, have caused the collapse of several downtown areas. - The returned have also been involved in the riots, with tensions reaching boiling point after the lynching of several of the returned in the vicinity of Frederick's Burg. Government security forces have been dispatched, to disperse the crowd which has sprung up in front of the City hall - I'm Ready, how you doing? - Just finishing. - Where are you guys going? - I don't know, but tonight we're gonna go to the motel hut on the 28'th. - No guys, that's ridiculous, you can't do that, you got to come with us. - Come on. - No, brother, thank you, but no, it's too much. - It's gonna be okay. - 114. - You count them too? - And I whisper to them. And I stroke them, say sweet nothings. They just won't multiply. - Sons of bitches... - It doesn't look like much, but it does the job. - This shouldn't be legal. - It's a gooey mass of greasy goodness, come on, get it in you. - We got some news. - There's 7 dead returned at St. John's hospital. and twelve at Central. - They attacked both places at once, sometime around 2 am. - Unbelieveable - What did the police say? - The usual bullshit. - That they can't be sure it was the anti-returned groups, but it doesn't look good. - And that's not the worst of it. They say it's just until the synthetic protein works. - We're not sending him to one of those places. - They're giving people 3 days. - They're planning on publishing lists, Kate. - Any returned that doesn't hand themselves over to a surveillance center is gonna be arrested. - Surveillance center? You fuckin' kidding me Jacob? You're starting to sound like them. Look at that! - Just try and convince Alex. Come up to the house with us. It's a safe place, just go talk to him, come on. Go talk to him, get your stuff and get the hell out of here. - I'm her agent! I'm her fucking agent, man! Okay, you know what? You're talking now, you're talking, blah blah blah.. not understanding a word you're saying. - Need more conflict. - Okay, more conflict, here's more conflict, alright? I really shouldn't feel this right now, but i'm compelled to feel it, and I am compelled to do it, go fuck yourself! - Oh brother, I love it when you get mad. - Do you? - I do. - Alex is very lucky to have you. - Why do you say that? - I'm a writer, I notice things in people. - What have you noticed? - That you don't let him feel sorry for himself. You don't treat him like a sick person, or like an invalid. - Because he isn't. - That's kinda spooky. - Did you take your shots today? - I want to eat your brain. - Okay, start with your wife. - I do not want to eat her brain. - It's too much brain. - Military uses force on citizens - They're going into people's houses. - They were doing that before. - No, not like this. - Not taking people by force against their will, it's like the fuckin' gestapo. That's why I want it Kate. That's why I want it with me. - You don't even know how to shoot. - Any idiot can shoot a gun, you point it, and you pull the trigger. - Yeah, don't exaggerate. - We're safe here - No, we're not. - We're too close to the city. And it's... ... it's too big of a risk for Jacob and Amber. - Okay, we're not gunmen, for fuck's sake. - We weren't before, but I have no idea what we are now. Everything has changed. You have a better idea? What do you want me to do? - I don't know, anything, I don't want a gun in the house. - Okay, I'm going to get the elevator, hurry. Jesus! -I'm detective Call, this is detective Anderson. We're here to see an Alex Green. - It will only take five minutes. - Well he's not here. What the hell is this, can you guys just show up here, unannounced. You have a search warrant, and I have to show you my place, I mean, I'm late, I'm... - We're just following orders, ma'm. - This house is on the list, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish. - Well, he left three weeks ago. - He left three weeks ago? - Or four weeks, on the 11th. - Any particular reason? - Not that I know of. I mean, you're men, you probably know better than me what goes on inside of mans head before he leaves a woman. - We'll need to see the rest of the apartment. - This is really annoying! The sound studio. Bedroom. - Do you have any idea where he might have gone? - I shot him in the head! I shot him in the fucking head! Oh my God! He ran out of his doses. - Why didn't you take him to the surveillance center? - He didn't want to. - Why didn't you make him? - Because, really, I mean, he was right not to. -They would have monitored and controlled him. - Oh my God, they would have let him die there. You know what those places are for. He would have died surrounded by strangers. I'm in trouble, aren't I? - Well, in theory yes. - In practice? - Our job is to put an X on the list. If what you are saying is true, then, our job is done, and frankly, it's a weight off our minds. We're gonna need to see a body. - Okay, but, Then it's done? No questions asked? - No questions asked. - Okay. - Hello! Hello? - Alright. Now, this stuff decomposes the bodies very quickly. What I can tell you is: It's a male, thirty-something, single shot to the head. - Okay, you don't have to pull him out, we'll call the Recovery unit. We got enough on our plates. My colleague will take you home. - Thanks. - If it makes you feel better, I think you did the right thing. In a couple hours they're going to announce they don't have the synthetic protein when they said they would. Seems it doesn't work the way they said it was gonna work. Things are gonna get complicated. - Thanks. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. Kate spoke to Eve. She is the woman who has been helping us with our supply. She's managed to get 60 more doses, so... - How? - So we're gonna leave in the morning, and get them. And then we're gonna get as far away from here as we can. - Sixty doses? Well, that gives you some time. - Yeah. - Well I mean, if you're doing that for us, there's really no need. You know that, right? - I know. - They're saying they'll figure this out in a matter of days Alex You know, weeks at the most, they're gonna make this work. - It's just better, if we get away. It's too dangerous. But thank you for everything that you've done. The negative results of the recent tests have required us to delay our expectations, the synthetic protein has not been synthesized yet. However, government laboratories are still fighting to find a solution, Our hope remains intact, since everything may change within the next few weeks. All the sections of the population need to stay calm, and be confident, that we are in control, and will deal with this Thank you, there'll be no questions. - Good morning. - Hey. - Want some coffee? _ Um, no thanks. - Oh, you looking for this? - Yeah, where was it? - On the sofa. - You're up early. - Yeah, Amber, she got up early to go visit her mother and she woke me up while she was at it. - Well, don't wake Alex up. - Isn't he going with you? - No, he thinks he is, but I turned off the alarm. - It's just easier if I go on my own, you know? - He's gonna be pissed. - Enjoy! - You know what Kate? I think it's admirable how calm you are. - So do I. - Bye. - This is Eve, you know what to do. - Hello? Eve? Eve? Hello? - Hey baby, what's happening? - Are Jacob and Amber home? - Why? What's wrong? - Just go in the bedroom and check the injections. - No, I think they've gone out. - Just go and check the injections! - Baby, what is going on, what's wrong? - Just fuckin' go! -Okay, okay, I'm going. I'M SORRY - Oh my God. - You know, what they did isn't much different from what we've been doing. That nurse was basically selling us doses that belonged to other people. - But we didn't kill anyone to get them. - Not directly. - I'm sorry, it was stupid, it was a stupid thing to say, I didn't mean it like that. Babe. - I wish you would hurry up and be more ??? - Are you sure he's gonna be able to see? - He's expecting me at 9. I told him it was important. Be there. - Are you gonna tell them? - Yes, they have a solution. But to find out I need to tell them the truth. Okay? - Okay. Jacob! Jacob! God damn, thank you, thank you, thank you! What the hell is going on? - I don't have much time, so let me speak, okay? - You don't have much time? Where the fuck are you man? - I can't tell you where I am, Alex. You know that. - Can' tell me? Where the fuck are you? You have my god damn doses man. - Alex you stop talking or I'm gonna hang up, do you understand me? - Where are you? - STOP TALKING! - Okay, okay, talk, just talk! - Amber is not in the room. She did not want me to call. And I promised I wasn't gonna call. But I had to talk to you. If this had been for me, I never would have done this. But it was for her. I know it's shitty... - Shitty? Are you fuckin' kidding me? I have less than 24 hours, do you understand that? - I had no choice, Alex, this is the shittiest thing I could have done, I understand that, but I had no choice. - You do have a choice, you do. Wait, just wait! Just listen, just listen! I'm sorry, listen. Just give me 6 or 7 doses, okay? You don't have to meet me, you can just leave them somewhere and I will pick them up. - How can I do that Alex? Why is your life more valuable than hers, huh? What makes you so special? - Jacob, man... - What? - You don't even have to meet me... - I can't do that. -... I'll come pick them up, okay? - I can't do that. Six or seven doses, thats 6 or 7 doses of her life. - Jacob, please man. - What choice do I have? Tell me. - Just give me a few, I don't I don't have... I haven't said goodbye to Kate yet, I'm not ready, just give me a few, that's all I need, just a few. I can not. -Jacob, please. Please, I just need a few. - Alex, I'm sorry Alex. Goodbye. - Jacob! - They have dismantled it, and taken everything to the military hospitals. So they've sent each of us to a different place. I'm in dialysis, Lucy is in ER, and Mary is upstairs with the kids. It's a mess. So I don't know what you want to do. David says he might wanna reschedule, because he's gonna be a while and he's having complications with the surgery. - I'll be back in a minute. - Will they ever get it to work? - Yes, I'm sure they will. They've been working for the last few days on the new antigens trying to implant them in the... - David, don't give me that. When? - You should have told me, Kate. - That I fell in love with a returned? - No, that you're so deeply involved with this. - So I can get a disciplinary? So that everybody, including the fucking cleaning lady, can gossip about me? What for? - To save us from this mess.
