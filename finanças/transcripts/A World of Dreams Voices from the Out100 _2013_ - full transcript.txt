(music) OUT magazine was founded in 1993, it was a fairly radical vision for a gay magazine at the time the goal of OUT was really to celebrate LGBT life -what we try to do, really, is represent you know, queerness, in 2013. -The way I saw the agenda of the magazine was how how do you... talk about a gay lesbian bisexual transgendered experience when it is also mainstreaming at the moment. -The OUT100 is different, and is unique. -The OUT100 has been one of the most fascinating, fulfilling, bizarre, um and rewarding things that I've ever worked on, so I really enjoy that, of course it takes up about half of our year while we're also doing every other issue -I've worked on many of these, actually, and it is you know, really, one of the highlights of my work at OUT -The idea that I get to be part of documenting a time period that is so progressive and transgressive meant everything to me. I would have taken on about 200 had I been given it. -The OUT100 is really a celebration of the dynamism and the power and the spirit of the LGBT community. The Depth and the Breadth of what we do and achieve in the wider world I'm Arron Hicklin, I'm the editor in chief of OUT magazine. -My name is Jerry Portwood, I'm the executive editor of OUT magazine. -My name is Jason Lanfier, I'm the senior editor at OUT -My name is Danielle Levitt, I'm a photographer, and I'm a filmmaker We launched the OUT100 as a fully photo- graphed portfolio of 100 people only 7 years ago. Prior to that a lot of the images were were...we'd use existing art. But in 2007, we took the decision that the entire OUT100 portfolio all 100 people plus the covers um, which is 104 people should be photographed um, by us, using if possible a single photographer and that meant that we could really push the boat out when it came to using a theme, drawing on a theme um, to to relate all these photographs together this years theme is the dreamers we chose the dreamers because dreaming is really what all people who engage in radically moving society forward and bringing down barriers and changing the profile of their community is what they do! -The way I interpreted it, was, everyone has dreams what do you do to make those dreams come true, as cliche as that sounds, -You know, opting for the dreamers theme gave us a freedom really, to represent each honoree the way that they wanted to be represented. -We came to Daniele because she has a history with the magazine and this is OUT100 really felt that we wanted to shoot as many people as we could in context. -So, for each candidate in the OUT100 we used elements of their lives, their dreams, what inspires them, who they were, what we knew about them, to create images -Danielle Levit is very good at capturing the gesture. The moment. (music) -And you have writers in this portfolio that are setting the tone, and they're changing perceptions -Gay and lesbian writers. Trans * writers, um all of them. They're the ones that are creating the narratives, they're creating. They're storytellers. -If it were not for writers um, very little of our social history would be documented -they're synthesizing the experiences that they and other people had and then presenting it to the world either as a play as um, as a book -Then theres someone like Choire Sicha who, um, began his career um, as a kind of bilious, commentator on society, um, on gawker. -But now very recent history came out, which was really exciting because we haven't really had uh, a recent uh depiction of queer life in New York (music) When I was a kid, like, I used to sit around and secretly write. I was like a really terrible writer. Like, I was really hacky. Like I didn't know how to put together a sentence, and I didn't go to college, so like, its not like I ever took a writing class or even a reading class what really helped me was writing online everyday because there was the pressure of having an audience even though I was writing for myself, like, I knew people were actually going to read it, so I was like uh..I have to work at it like writing listings was amazing for me because to, uh cram stuff into like two sentences, and explain what it was, explain where it was, and nail it all down and I got really concise after doing that for a year My name's Choire Siche and I work as a writer Theres a huge amount of young gay guys here in New York They're also, um, you feel like theres this sort of endless sense of community that doesn't stop and start but I also felt like they all knew or knew of or knew someone who knew everyone, do you know what I mean? Like, its like it was like a giant, um a giant facebook web, of like, friends of friends, basically The weird common ground is whether you hung out in this bar in Williamsburg, or whether you were in Manhattian, you would all meet up online, actually. So there was this weird way in that the city is super transparent across like, different genres of people? Thats not really what you would say communities of people. Etc. I was a very weird child. Uh, I was unnaturally shy, like, for which I mean, there was no reason. My parents were pretty great, like. I was like a weird child who sort of like I was a pack-rat, and a slob I was very messy as a child and I also was much happier lying about things than like, telling uncomfortable truths so I was like a weird little pyromaniac liar. I was not a great or fun kid. I realized I wasn't like other kids really early but I don't know why or what it was. I think the other kids noticed I didn't really have to come out in high school. I was out um, I mean I started dating at like, 13. I came out to my mother at 17, not very well it was like a big production number for no reason shes also gay um, so thats weird. But I did it very poorly. Yeah. And its fine, you know, you just you do a sloppy job, that, it works. just as well. It doesn't matter really in the end it tortured me like, I felt tortured by it but I don't really know why. And it shouldn't have been, and its not a big deal. It was definitely hard being it was definitely not fun being, like the only out person in high school of 4,000 people for four years. But uh, it was kind of worth it I was 30 and I quit my sort of stable job, to take a 24,000 dollar a year writing job which was the first person to ever pay me to write anything and I just had a terrible break up, and I was sort of like this is now or never. Like, you are 30 now, you have to do this or you're never gonna do it. And. You know it was just sort of this lesson I keep learning over and over again which is such a cliche it sounds like I grew up in California which I did, which is like you saying yes to things. Like, sure Yes of course, I'm in my 30s and I'd love to make 24,000 dollars a year. Like you know, thats nuts! But, um but it was totally worth it and it was a great opportunity and um, and if I hadn't done that I wouldn't be working as a writer today at all. (rock music) I grew up reading the gay magazines because where else would I hear and learn about gay stuff? And so I was always, I always had this thing where I was like, well, who are these queens? Like, you know what I mean? And Like um, and they're not so great! being on the OUT100 list is mostly amusing. I mean, its funny! Its funny. I would like a little, like title or like something to wear that proclaims me as like 100 most important gays for sure. (rock music) Tarell McCraney is uh a prime example of one of those kind of, astonishing queer writers who are telling queer stories, and um, really I think inspiring young people -A black gay writer like Tarell Alvin McCraney is doing a really valuable and profound job in documenting um, not only the lives of, not only being black in America, but being black and gay in America. -He has this ability where everyone wants to be his friend, and everyone wants to know him and spend time with him because you feel like you're learning about him, but you're also learning about yourself We're at Yale. At the Windom Cambell Award ceremony because I am being honored with uh, 8 other writers we are in categories of fiction non-fiction and playwriting being given 150,000 dollars each for our integrity and for our work the idea of the Windom Cambell Award is to impact writers um, at whatever stage of their career. My name is Tarell Alvin McCraney. I am a playwrite. And a director. Ensemble member at the Steppinwolf Theater I spent a lot of time in the arts I spent a lot of time, um going to class for theater for, um, acting my first job as a teenager was to go out and do preventative theater um, in the community. Talking about HIV and AIDS prevention and um, and drug abuse and prevention. I sort of kept that in the back of my head and didn't really know what I wanted to do but kept working in the theater none the less, and then one day I turned around and I happened to be a theater artist which was strange and just sort of woke up one morning and I was, this is what I was doing um, and it felt organic because I just had always been doing it I'm always interested in the dubious nature of peoples identity, and how they can be performative in one way, but also that that performance sublimates and becomes something else in another. I'm always interested in how you know, someone can present themselves as sort of a tom-boy um, but then maybe in, at dinner they like to be treated like, you know a princess. My work is trying to specifically talk about the dubious nature of character I don't know, I guess the word I would use is that I let go. A lot, or I have to let go. Cause theres no way of sort of wrangling it (music) I recognize that I wasn't like the other kids almost immediately and instantaneously. Um but I also noticed that there were other kids who were not like everybody else, too I felt weird a lot. And awkward. I also thought...I also had a good time in my own mind. I always had the ability to gauge myself through my parents. Um, I could see the look that they gave me often and they were always kind of befuddled they always looked at me like, what is happening? And then I would do something, and they would come see, you know, a performance, or you know, hear about something I did outside of the house and they kind of looked at me in one way and I was like, okay, yeah alright we know that kid. One of the things that on reflection, I can I absolutely remember noticing is that there were a gaggle of sort of, misfit kids who kind of ran together and as we matriculated through the process of school um, you could see some conform, and some stick to their sort of... strange duckling ways. Its less of a process of coming out and more so a process of clarifying and I've had to clarify all my life and I think most people do but, I didn't have that moment where I had to sit anybody down at Thanksgiving dinner and say you know I'm a man who likes to sleep with men but also I think women are attractive pass the turkey, like I didn't have to sit down and have that sort of byline conversation I was brutalized as a kid, so I was always afraid to sort of take steps to assert myself and to reach out for what I believed in. One of the things that happened to me when I was bullied there was a day where I was coming home from school um, and a group of boys decided that they were gonna chase me with rocks. And, um They were running after me, throwing these big-ass boulders at me and um, and then all of a sudden I ran past a parking lot, and they stopped throwing the rocks at me, and they were still running after me, but they stopped throwing the rocks, and I couldn't figure out why. And then I realized that after I passed the parking lot they started throwing rocks again and they were throwing rocks they stopped throwing the rocks because they didn't want to break the glass in the cars and it made me think to myself in that moment, I kind of recognized in myself that they valued me less than they valued this glass in the cars and how these boys thought of me as sort of worthless shook me um, it frightened me because in that moment, they .....I was worthless... I had empathy for those young men for some reason. I still do. I can only imagine what they were dealing with at home that made them feel the only power that they could get was to, um to oppress me, in a way (music) My hope, my inner hope is that sharing this earth and sharing space allows people to know that at heart I am for them and hopefully they're for me which, actually that doesn't matter as much as knowing that I am certainly for them, and for their benefit. Representations of queer characters on television and in film has played a critical role in, uh, in helping us get the equality that we have so long deserved -TV and film have had such a huge impact on people's perceptions -They need to look back in time and tell the story of Salminio and tell the story of Allen Ginsburg and you know, tell the story of Harvey Milk, and in doing that, they create an understanding -One of the highlights for me, being an editor of OUT magazine is I get to pick and choose who I want to interview and earlier this year I was able to interview Daniel Radcliffe for an edition of OUT based on his roll in Kill Your Darlings. It was super clear from Daniel's enthusiasm for working with John Krokidas who co-wrote and directed Kill Your Darlings, that he was a special guy and you know, all of us who work in a creative field really should think of ourselves as collaborators, not, you know the "artist" at the top of the pyramid and I think John Krokidas really does that I am actually living the dream you know, I decided around the age of 21, 22, that I wanted to try my hand at filmmaking I've been living with this movie for the last 10 years of my life, you know, doing everything I can in my power to get this film made. I just cared this much about the story and knew that this was what I was good at you know, I told myself that if I didn't make my first film by the time that I was 40, that it was time to give up and go to plan B and one of the really poignant parts of this experience was we had our New York premier on the last night of my 39th year I literally just made it under the gun My name is John Krokitas and I'm a filmmaker Spike Lee was one of my directing professors at NYU, and he made us write down in two sentences why do you want to make films? and I remember writing down to entertain people and hopefully make the world a better place there has to be some kind of social resonance for me. Its about finding topics that you care so much about that you need to tell the story You know, when doing a movie on Allen Ginsburg Jack Carowack and William Burrows I mean you're taking on these three huge like, artistic icons and there came a point in the research process where I just became so ...theres so much out there on these guys that I became kind of overwhelmed and intimidated by having to somehow live up to the legends they would later become, even though in the movie at this point in the time of their lives, they're kind of just these awkward insecure 19 year olds this movie is about a closeted kid from Patterson New Jersey, who just got into his dream school in New York City and can't wait to get there because there might be other bohemians and there might be other gay people there. Like, that was a character that I knew I could write, and that I could direct. And I approached working with the actors in the same way. The cast that I got this is like, my dream cast. Its like I won the lottery. And while it was incredibly intimidating at first to be surrounded by so many experienced actors who's work I admired the great thing about it is they really supported me and trusted me and taught me so much about the collaborative process of filmmaking I started off, I went to college wanting to be an actor. But when I went to college I was still somewhat closeted, and I wasn't really ready to access I think, my inner emotions and display them for the rest of the world to see and so you know, you realize after getting cast as knave number 5 one too many times or for me it was being cast as the mute in the musical the fantastics, and having to mime in black lycra while everyone else was singing and dancing around me going, what the hell am I doing with my life that I realized that perhaps acting was not what the universe had intended for me I just started playing around with the camera and making little movies with my actor friends and it felt like a good fit and somehow I convinced one of my professors to let me make a film instead of a paper for my thesis and it started getting some play on local public television, and my friends watched it and my best friend who actually wrote Kill Your Darlings with me, Austin Bunn I remember said, John, it doesn't suck and its a lot better than I thought it would be and thats the kind of affirmation you need when you're first starting out. My father passed away when I was in my junior year of college and it was after getting over the grief that everything just kind of was put into perspective for me and I realized that if filmmaking was my dream, that this was my chance to go and make it come true and I was trying to decide should I move to LA or should I move to New York and while I was in New York having my interview for school Rent was on broadway and I went to Rent and there are a bunch of bohemians jumping up on tables kicking over wine bottles, declaring themselves artists, and I said fuck the studio system I'm going to move to New York and jump on tables and knock down bottles of wine and declare myself an artist yeah, if this issue is about the dreamers, you know, let this just be a testament to anyone out there whos trying to make their creative dreams come true. You know, everyone always says its about persistence, and thats absolutely right, but on the flip side, the other thing that I've learned is if you have an incredible insecurity and a crippling sense of self-doubt that's a good thing because it keeps you working harder and it keeps you making whatever it is you're trying to do and whatever dream you're trying to make come true it makes you work that much harder to attain it. Dustin Lanceblack, I think most people focus on him because of Milk, and um J. Edgar and these big films that hes had made but I think the other part of him that people forget about, is how essential he was in the fight for the repeal of prop 8. -A prime example of what we look for, uh when we select our honorees for the OUT100 we're looking for people who are visible who are out there, on the front lines trying to they are fighting for the cause. They are trying establish the equality that the LGBT community has so long deserved. He has been fighting he's been fighting for years now. I am in such awe and respect of someone who puts their politics on the table and puts themselves on the table so that they can help effect change I feel like I want to see a day where uh, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered people in all 435 congressional districts, in all 50 states that we all have the same shot you know, right now we don't And that is my dream I think the power of dream is naming it. Saying it. sharing it, because I think dreams are not things that go unrealized. Dreams are sort of like blueprints for where we're going and if you can get to work those things become reality. I think stories are the most powerful thing we have uh, to communicate, to change minds to change hearts, if you can do that, you can start to change communities, states, countries, the world I just think they're the most potent thing we have I grew up around stories, I grew up around crafting stories, and thats what I wanted to do, and um, you know, I didn't grow up wealthy so I couldn't self-finance movies, so I became a screenwriter I am Dustin Lanceblack, and I'm a filmmaker writer, producer, directer, all that uh, but my other job is as an activist in the movement and namely as one of the founding boardmembers of the american foundation for equal rights, best known for waging the fight against proposition 8 here in California Inspiration comes from reading you know, our history reading any history. Listening to people tell stories. And for me its alway that very very personal story um, and its usually about an outsider of some sort and uh, and the power that the outsider has to create the chaos, and their comfortablity creating the chaos that's necessary to create change I mean I grew up in San Antonio, Texas uh, in a mormon home, a devout mormon home uh, with you know, parents or step parents who were in the military. I remember so clearly at 6 years old uh, there was a boy who had stolen a toy car from me and, uh, and spray painted it to try and conceal it, and we're a very very poor family and there was no replacing it, and uh, I just remember him walking away from me, and just really feeling hurt, not angry, but hurt and knowing that that was the moment that I just absolutely had fallen for him. I had a huge crush on him and I was hurt that he would do something like that to me. Now, I was, you know, aware enough of what gay men that I knew thats who I was and I knew it was a bad thing. Cause thats what I'd been taught. And I knew if anyone found out I would bring great shame to my family you know, how does that shape me well, I survived I got lucky I did the hard work, and it is hard work to recover from the injuries that you suffer when you're a kid in that sort of environment. Injuries to your soul, to your self-esteem really I've taken whatever strength I've drawn from being able to recover from that and I work every single day, every single day to make sure that kids won't feel that again, cause its unnecessary. Thats what that kind of childhood did to me. Is turn me into a fighter. And we're not gonna let it happen forever. You know coming out is this long process isn't it? Its a lifelong process for some people for many people. Like you keep having to do it. You come out to your family, and you know, and that was hard cause I do come from a conservative family and it was a process of, um going through all the sort of fears that people have because of the stories they've heard whether its in the church or the military my mom was she was afraid for me, she thought I would end my career, it would hurt my ability to be out in the world and I think blaming herself thinking she had somehow done something wrong it wasn't until she started coming out here and she started meeting my friends. So she would listen to my gay and lesbian friends problems you know? About being kicked out of their home or suffering in some way, uh, from rejection, and it didn't match up with what she had heard about gay and lesbian people. And uh its, I'm tellin ya its those stories, its those personal connections that change minds, change hearts and I watched it change my mom I would say, in both my creative work and in my political work, um what I'm most focused on post proposition 8 uh, being done away with is the south. All the states that we've left behind that haven't been a part of the conversation, that haven't moved forward. Places where its still, you can still lose your job and your home if you come out those of us who are lucky enough to be on the coast where we have more freedom and protections, we've neglected some of our brothers and sisters in the middle of the country and in the south and we are living in two Americas thats not the Tradition of this country in fact the tradition of the country is when we see two Americas, we have to fix that and I feel like thats where we are right now so whether its my creative work or my political work uh, thats those are the conversation I'm trying to create this is a movement of accepting diversity of accepting difference embracing difference. Starting to see the value in diversity instead of that weird reaction that I saw growing up where if I was in a mall in Texas and its mostly white, you know, christian people and all of a sudden someone of a different race or dressed very differently walks by, their parents will pull the child in a little tighter and I'm saying that that is counter-productive! Um I do not want to see LGBT people become the same as anybody. And I think that what I want for them are the same protections and the same rights as everybody else. Protect our right to be different. You know, its what this country was built on and its what we should be. Gay straight, black, white, rich, poor, I don't want people to feel that they have to be the same as anyone uh, and I think once we get to that point, um Its very hopeful. But once we get to that point where diversity is seen as advantageous uh, we'll be the strongest country in the world again. Lea Delaria, legendary comedian, who has never once faltered on who she was or apologised for who she was, or ever changed who she was. -Lea Delaria does mean different things to a lot of people because, you know, growing up in the 90s, I do remember when she was on Arsinal Hall and made her big statement that I'm a big dyke and and that again was like oh, the world's gonna blow up, the world's gonna end and she was able to always use humor, I think, to defuse a lot of situations Life is a rollercoaster and careers can be a rollercoaster and you know, Lea Delaria was saying in her interview with OUT that, you know 2012 was one of the worst years in her life -and then she got cast in Orange is the New Black -And then suddenly 2013 has become one of the best years of her life Well, the first thing I want people to know is that I'm actually not a lesbian that this whole thing has been a career move, and I'm married with 5 kids. The biggest thing I want people to know about me, is that um, I wrote the joke what does a lesbian bring on a second date? The uhaul I wrote that joke. That joke was so popular it beat me to the west coast. I couldn't even I couldn't tell the joke for the west coast, it was already in the west coast. So as the counter joke, that I also wrote, what does a gay man bring on a second date? What second date? So both of those....both of those have become sort of a part of our culture. And, uh yeah. I wrote it. My name's Lea Delaria and I am a womanizer the fact that I'm on the OUT100 list makes me say, not only am I acting on this show thats a great show, but, you know, people in my community are noticing it you know, and thats important to me, you know? I don't...I don't like to be the one thats preaching to the choir but I do think its important to me that if my community appreciates what I'm doing. Yeah that makes me happy. I'm in two things that are on television right now, um one is called Dear Dumb Diary thats a tween movie musical thats on the hallmark channel um, based on the book series of the same title I am also in Orange is the New Black which is a netflix original series that is incredibly popular um, in which there was a fisting scene in the pilot, so the irony of me being on both these shows at the same time is not lost on me at all -haha wigga, please. Mercy gonna dump your ass the second she gets out of here. She likes new shiny things. And outta here you, are as dull as an old pensil, with saggy tits and a fucked up tattoo on its neck. -Oh, butchy, face it I win, you lose. She hates you. She loves me. -Ahah. Yeah. And she loved me, too. For two whole years and then she dropped my butch ass for you and if you don't think thats the way she do then you are dumber than you look, which is pretty fuckin dumb cause you look like your relatives have been fucking each other for generations. This character, uh, wasn't even originally in the show. Uh when I auditioned, they loved me, and basically wrote this character for me. This character was supposed to be in a couple episodes and then gone. The only thing about it thats different is, I've never spent more than one night in jail its easier for her to show her heart than it is for me to show my heart let me put it that way. And again I'm being paid to do that, and part of that is acting, and some of that is the butch thing for me, you know, the outer crust, the shell, is uh, a really important part (singing) I was such a little tomboy, I was such a dyke. Normally uh, a girl like that gets horribly picked on, and they never picked on me. One, cause I would kick the shit out of them, I can back up my tomboy and two, because I was really really funny, and I was able to float around from group to group to group I look at that now, and think I don't know how I did that haha I have no idea how I did that but thats kind of what my childhood was like. And, total asshole. Just, total smartass always in trouble. Always getting wacked by the duds I can't ever remember being attracted to men. I mean I just cant ever remember it and uh, but I remember that I knew better than to talk about it. Do you know what I mean? because, and all the books that I read, and all the old movies that I watched, you know and all the kids that I would talk to... there didn't seem to be anybody talking about that I was probably I guess 16 or 17 before I just admitted it out loud and you know, I was lucky enough to have...stonewall had happened already so I mean I was a teenager in the 70s so I had the sort of queer movement happening around me, on television, on the news at that time, in a way it hadn't been before. I had been discriminated against in such a variety of different ways, um, I was arrested for being gay in Saint Luis in the 70s, you know, just for being gay. I was fired from my job for being gay. there was nothing I could do And the same thing with arrest, look, if the police tell you to put your hands up, you put your hands up And of course, I was queer bashed, there was the famous I have the scar here. on my nose, its in the shape of an L which, I don't know if you can see on camera now but theres a scar um, cause I was queer bashed on the corner of Market and uh, um, Castro Street in San Francisco. In pretty much broad daylight and while people stood around, and nobody helped because nobody would help in those days, it was just the way it was. But I think that just made me push harder to try to do something about it try to make some kind of change. I chose to live my life in a political way. You know I was an openly gay comic I never once cowered in the closet, I was always right out there, I have always been exactly who I am and the reason for that besides wanting to get laid is that I'm trying to make a change. I'm trying to effect some sort of change. We still got a long way to go heh a really long way to go. But honestly, we've come farther than I ever thought we'd get in my lifetime So what we did this year was we decided to identify 10 people who were worthy of a readers choice award, and then submit that to our readers to select one of them. And the readers to my delight, chose Laverne Cox. I think Laverne is really, again much like Lea Delaria, and a lot of the actresses on that show. So audacious and really willing to go there. -While we're beginning to see more gay men and more lesbians in TV shows seeing transgender characters and let alone transgender performers on TV is um, is very nascent its very, you know, its in its early stages and theres a long way to go and Laverne Cox is really leading the way there I'm just a person who is trying to live my dreams. I'm just a person who wants to believe that anything is possible and doesn't want to give up Dreams are sort of what sustains me. When I was a kid, my dream was to do what I'm doing now what's sad to me is that, like, when I started to really, like, you know come to terms with being trans and knew that I had to...you know, couldn't lie about that anymore, and I had to transition, I thought that it wasn't possible for me to have this dream of being an actor because I was trans, and um, here we are My name is Laverne Cox, I'm an actress, and I'm a dreamer hehe! I love love love being an actor. I love the moments with other actors, I just, I live for it, and its what I have fought to do. I fought my own demons. I, you know, I feel like sometimes I'm fighting the industry that you know, sort of says that its not possible, so You...to do what I love doing, I'll take all the other stuff. -What do you want from me? -I wanna see a doctor. -You can't go to the clinic unless its an emergency is an emergency. -Yeah, well we don't see it that way. A lot of folks know me from the show Orange is the New Black The response to my character in the show has been so overwhelmingly positive and really amazing, I...Folks have literally written blogs saying that their ideas about trans people have changed because of this character -Was there something else? -Yes. You know, so many trans folks too, have also written to me saying that they see their stories, in Sophia, and I think when we have characters on television particularly who mirror our stories I think it makes us feel less alone It makes us feel more connected to the world and it validates our experience How do we create spaces where we love trans people is really really really the question I often ask myself Its what I like to talk about a lot um, Cordell West tells us that justice is what love looks like in public and I'm obsessed with loving trans people and with trying to create space for that. If we really really love someone we're going to honor what they say and how they feel about themselves we're not going to sort of, you know stigmatize them or demonize them, if we really love someone, how do we, like how do we really have love for trans people and for black trans people, too and trans people of color in general, because we don't get a lot of love. Things might be getting better for some segments of the LGBT community but for the T part? Its still a state of emergency. -You really think I'd be eating a bobble head if I wanted to kill myself? Listen doc, I need my dosage. I've given five years, eighty-thousand dollars, and my freedom for this. A lot of my childhood was about sort of achieving and trying to stay alive, and trying not to get beaten up. I was a kid who was just creative, and liked to learn. I was a nerd I sort of, I was majorly bullied as a kid, and so I was called anti-gay slurs and I was bullied. And I was just not, I was from Alabama but I dunno if I was OF Alabama. So I initially came out to my mother as gay, and she sort of freaked out I was at Indiana University at the time and then, several years later I came out to her as trans and...that was It was better. It was better, but then it was the adjustment of her needing to adjust her pronouns, the ...that was a big piece, and then her freaking out about just, me changing my body, that there was, you know my mother...just not pro.... medication, or surgery, or any of that stuff. But I think that was the part that sort of freaked you out and I think it was really important for her. I still don't even know if she knows that thats not...that its not a gay thing. Being trans is not a gay thing It really isn't. Its just, I'm a woman. and.... I've always been a woman. I just needed to...I just had to have a different journey to get there. Her seeing me have a happy, healthy life where I have achieved some of my goals and I'm considered successful by some peoples standards its like, okay, its all good. Hehe! You know I think most parents probably just want to know that you're gonna be healthy and happy, and that you're gonna be okay, and thats certainly what my mother has always wanted for me I could cry thinking about me being a readers choice award winner for this its like...a black trans woman being the choice for anything is like... its still new for me, I have to say I'm really overwhelmed and so grateful the fans of our show are so unbelievable, and they go hard there was actually, there was some people who were tweeting, oh, you should vote for this, vote for Laverne, and like, then they make...the fans rallied each other in social media, to like, to make this happen. And thank you to all the fans everyone who voted for me. Its just there really aren't even words to describe how that feels. Its crazy overwhelming. Fashion is, in a lot of ways, the most basic way that we as humans express ourselves. -What I really like about the fashion in OUT magazine is that I think it always tells a story -It may to some people seem superficial or fickle, or not that relevant to their lives, but, these are some of the most public gay people in society Shayne Oliver is really coming into his own, and I'm very proud to see him be celebrated. -And I think Shane is a new, strong voice in the fashion world -And hes been influenced by so many New York things, its incredible A lot of the collections are like dreams, for sure, for me I mean, like, especially now like, that I can do, like more elaborate concepts like, my dreams are becoming a reality But, you know, I also have, like dreams that I try to have come true by just existing. I feel like being like, a true person changes things in a way, so its kind of like living by example I am Shayne Oliver, and I'm the creative director of Hood By Air I was partying like, at a really young age, and I was like, 14? and I was outside the club, and then like, like I was kinda like doing like the sad eyes, and like, Sophia Lamore was like come in with me, and then, after that I like went home, and I told my mom like, oh my god, I met these amazing people they're like, so cool, and like I feel at home and... she made a comment to me that really pissed me off, I don't want to say it, but like and I was like, well um, thats not true. And she was like, how do you know thats not true, and I was like, well, because I'm gay. So, I came out at like 14. She cried for one day and the day after that she um, rented me Paris is Burning and that was it I started like making my own clothes, like, around the age of like 6, I guess it was just like, just like natural second nature type of thing you know its like. I used to hang out with my grandmother a lot and she was a seamstress and I used to learn from her and then I would have her like make me stuff. I couldn't make it and it was like some insane things that like, um, when I think back I'm like, ooof! The dandy-lady thing comes from her for sure The philosophy began as this, uh, sort of concept of getting dressed...ready to look great. you know? And uh within the lifestyle that myself and my friends live so, it was kind of like, Hood By Air was like a term that represents, like, getting...looking great, feeling great, you know? Um and like, coming from, like uh Brooklin into Manhattan and like going back and forth and like the kind of, uh what it took to do that you know? Just like the concept and the best of both worlds, type of thing. So it was more like, these, like objects that were meant to represent both these worlds, and now its kind of like forming yourself into being like a brand so the philosophy is changing to more of this thing where its like its a sense of like its own luxury, and its like like genre for itself we were just like, dealing with the issues of like uh, how americans how people like love about americans its like, how casual we are we think everything is like, frivolous, and like, so I just wanted to bring, like update that and kind of like uh, create a concept for how we really see it and what it means to us cause its like, a t-shirt is like gold so thats, you know, so I grew up, like, in Brooklyn and like, and the Carribean, and I also uh, was involved in the ballroom scene, and I also was like, deeply like, brought up by, like, hiphop you know, and like, its like really intimidating in a way, cause its like really powerful, its like meant to like, come at you really hard. You know, I feel like the ballroom scene is the same exact way, you know? its like I mean I don't see any of that stuff as like, fake. I don't see vougeing as like, fake. You know, I see it as something thats like really like its meant to be impactful and like, its full of statements, its not like coy, you know what I mean? And I think like, hiphop has the same obviously has the same effect on people but like, its like, um its made its way out of the subculture. They grew up in the same communities, you know what I mean? like its like, they want the same things? you know what I mean? its like, they're kind of like, a mix between like of what you want, who you are its great to like, have your community like appreciate what you're doing, you know? you know, especially like, its like, really important, you know? The catwalk, or the runway, is also been, um, really important for um, ideas around sexuality and sexual identity and gender. -That you're able to have, um, a man who models womenswear, and you're able to have a woman, like Casey Legler, who is modeling menswear The way that I landed in fashion was, um by way of, um kind of the artistic community within which I inhabit here in New York, so I had a friend who was doing a shoot for Muse magazine, and asked me, kind of, if I was available that day, this particular story was called Out with the Boys, and um, she did not she just kind of was not so interested in using actual biological men for the for the piece and I pass so she said are you free? and I did not know that at the end of the day um, my pal would say I think that you might be able to do this.. hehe! Do you mind if I show these pictures to my buddy at Forward, and uh, so I said yes, and that was kind of the beginning of all of it haha! I'm Casey Legler and um, I am an artist and, uh, former um, olympic athlete and uh, currently my art has taken on, um in its most public form, has been as a model. Often times on set, definitely at the beginning I was the only one that understood what was going on, and I actually didn't really understand, cause you know my background is, um, is my own art-making practice where I used my body, but here I was kind of using it uh in collaboration and in direct collaboration with another person so, oftentimes in the beginning I would show up on a set and I've been blessed to work with so many wonderful people um, we all had to figure out uh, heheh! We all had to figure out that day on set kind of what was happening, cause you know, I was being booked via um, the mens board, so we just kinda had to be really specific with people about like, this actually does mean that Casey rolls deep with the mens clothes, you know what I'm sayin? This is whats interesting to me about this list, right? is that rather than coming from a place of, um conformity uh, the place that I like to come from is I actually have something that you may be interested in, and I'm happy to share it with you if you want. I happen to be able to vehicle, kind of, the celebration of difference in a really specific way, um in the place that I take up in fashion and fashion as a whole has been so gracious. More than anything I would like to think that this is maybe opening up a little bit of a gap a little bit wider around how we um, celebrate the differences of people I was a young professional athlete and, um I think in many ways I was an accidental athlete, my heart was really more in..um, was in academics, was really more in, um, art it was more in reading, that was...that was heh that was my favorite passtime was reading, so I was not very competitive, um the water was cold hehe! you know, uh I wanted to be doing kind of perhaps, more quiet things. And um, and instead what was happening was that this career was just kind of taking on a life of its own, so, for me I have the olympic experience of what it was like being really good at something that I didn't necessarily love and adore and I feel like I've been gifted this second opportunity to exist in a space where I get to engage with things that I love My hope is absolutely to inspire, you know and inspire, um inspire risk taking and space taking. I'm not immune to, um not being celebrated is putting it really nicely you know? So, how does that make me feel? All it does is it makes me kind of wonder at the different ways in which I can continue to make space for difference so that maybe eventually when my niece and nephew grow up however they are going to be different is going to have enough room Sadly enough, we don't have a lot of out athletes -Yeah, mixed marshal arts is a fascinating area, um, I mean its already given us at least two fighters who defy convention, um you know, Fallon Fox, who's a transgender mixed marshal artist, um, and who has already been featured in OUT, and LúCarmoliche, um, you know a lesbian fighter, um who's fought in the UFC -Its a powerful story I'm really hoping that Lúcan help pave the way for more athletes to come out. Friends have suggested that I check out MMA fighting, um they just thought that it'd be the perfect mix for everything I was looking for. I wanted, I'm always looking for a physical challenge. And they just suggested with my energy level, my aggression, that that would be a good fit, and I've been hooked ever since My first day sparing, hair pulled out clothes ripped, and just covered in blood hahaha! My name is Lú Carmoliche, I'm a professional mixed martial arts fighter My nickname is the gorilla. And it comes from again, my coach, Manolo, hes the mastermind of the entire team the guy that comes up with all the crazy jokes, the crazy fight-names. Originally it was LúLemon, and, uh because I would always make these ridiculous faces when I would go in there against an opponent. And then he changed it to the gorilla, cause I would climb off-cage, jump off the cages, do all these feats of strength that shouldn't be possible for a tiny person my size. So he deemed me the gorilla I love MMA. Whether its the fact that its constantly evolving, and if you settle for one second, if you allow yourself to just kind of, sit and relax, then you fall to the wayside, and you're on the backburner. And that, the idea of growing so much in a sport is appealing to me. I like the idea of evolving and growing and changing. And it seems like every day there are new generations coming up, they're learning so much in the sport that it makes it fun, and it makes you wanna push yourself that much harder and then my teammates are just so much fun, and even if I'm having a horrible day, the moment I walk through that door, seeing my coach, and his big smile and his goofy jokes. It doesn't matter. I know I'm where I'm supposed to be. Getting to see a child or just a person when you teach them, and you see that click you see them have a hunger to learn it theres, its, its like a bliss I can't explain it. I love watching as they finally, just, it clicks, and they fall in love with something, and they just wanna go as far as they can with it. And there are all those struggles that they had where they weren't quite sure whether it was something they wanted to persue, and then finally it just falls into place. Its an indescribable, wonderful feeling I came out for the first time was in the marine corps, and I was in a command that wasn't accepting, in fact, quite the contrary to that, uh, so here I am trying to learn myself and to come out and be comfortable, and I couldn't do that and on top of everything else, my roommate was a homophobe, and a bigot, and every other thing you could possibly think of that would threaten, having no idea of my own sexual orientation saying that if she ever met somebody who was gay she wanted to be put on the front lines and killed first um, and just wanted to out them and here I am with my roommate, I'm like, oh great, year we share a room together. This is a lot of fun for me. Haha! Never bring a girl home, I get it. And then, once I finally got out and I pulled her aside, she was leaving to go back to her home. I am like, look, you know if our friendship is actually gonna become a real friendship and evolve to something else, you have to know who I am. Its something that I wasn't willing to accept for a long time and I couldn't be myself in the marine corps, but I'm not in the marine corps anymore and if you're really gonna embrace me as a friend, you have to know who I am. And I was expecting her to hit me, I was expecting her to storm off, do something and instead she said that through her relationship with me, she realized that she couldn't have that view on people that to judge them before ever getting to know them in this characteristic group wasn't fair to them. And that, by knowing me she realized that, here is somebody that she loved and cared about that happened to be gay and if she had just opened her eyes more maybe things would have been different, and she didn't, now she has a different perspective Well the great thing about my family is my mom is this hippie who is accepting and loving of everybody I mean thats one of her things is that I can bring anybody home, friends, whomever it happens to be and she'll accept them and bring them into her home so I knew it wasn't gonna be an issue coming out to her, but I still knew that she wanted the best for me, and she didn't want me to have any hardships in my life, and, just wanting me to be happy so, there was always that doubt, and what if maybe she just says these things but its different when its me, and no, she was like, yeah, psh! I knew, I've just been waiting for you. I'm like, you've been you know, that would have been nice, if you had told me throughout so I didn't have to struggle all those years, if you just let me know, and she was like, I tried, you just weren't listening hehe! Friends, same thing. They were like, yeah thats not really a big surprise. So I think I was fortunate enough that my friends and family all knew and were accepting me for who I am I definitely feel like there is some activism I do want to do, which is why I have been so open about my sexual orientation because I want people, um to know as much as they can about it and I want to be as open and honest, so that people can ask those questions willingly and openly and not have to worry about anything Um, and for me right now, just with my lifestyle and how busy it is, thats about as active as I can be with it. But any opportunity that we have that can help open up peoples eyes to things that they had before had such skewed views of, I embrace, and I'm grateful for it, I'd rather have it be in the mainstream and have everybody accept it, than people be beaten or judged for something that... a choice that they made or didn't make. It was a big step for me getting out of the marine corps. Theres so many safeties there. You're guaranteed that even if you don't get paid, food is taken care of, your home is taken care of, if for any thing else, if you cant make rent you have a barracks room that they can put you up in so I knew that I had a guaranteed job, guaranteed medical, everything essentially was taken care of, I didn't have to worry about anything and I took a risk in getting out and having nothing. I didn't have a job lined up. I had barely and savings, I had no place to live and I took that risk getting out and it showed me that I made the right decision I decided to fall on my dream to be involved in this sport, and its set up the rest of my life, and I've just been following that dream ever since. Being in the OUT100 just blows my mind even looking back over the years I never thought that I would be one of those people and now, um it just is like, oh, it just never was a thought, it was like, it won't be me, I'm not gonna be that person and its even more than a dream come true. Obviously one of the most profound news stories of the year was around marriage equality and around the supreme court and the decisions that they came to with both DOMA and, uh, proposition 8 -Defined in the last 10 years has really not simply been about marriage, or I think its been about, redefining gay identity around LGBT and gay identity around love. -We would not have this tremendous news in 2013 without um without Paul Katami and Jeff Zarillo Its funny, cause we've referred to ourself throughout this whole process as just two ordinary guys who happen to be in love with each other and want to spend the rest of our lives with each other and thats really who we are. We are ordinary guys who go to work every day pay our bills, walk our dogs and go on vacations and live our lives. Thats really who we are But I think thats sort of our message to everybody else. Is ordinary people can make a decision to do extraordinary things. My name is Paul Katami and I am one of the plaintiffs in the prop 8 case. - I'm Jeff Zarrillo I'm also one of the plaintiffs in the prop 8 case and his new husband. We became involved in this lawsuit about found and a half years ago, after proposition 8 passed in California uh, the California supreme court had uh, ruled, that gays and lesbians had the right to marry early in 2008 and uh soon thereafter, opponents of that ruling put a measure on the ballot in California called proposition 8, that would strip those rights away from gays and lesbians and on election day in 2008, when America had elected its first african american president We'd come a long way, we really hadn't come as far as we thought because the citizens of California also voted in favor of proposition 8, which took the right for Paul and I to marry, and so many others like us to marry, away from us and we decided at that point that enough was enough and we wanted to do something about it -It was about our love it wasn't about anything else. And we knew that if we spoke the truth and kept it about our love, that represented so many millions of other peoples exact desire to be married in a situation like Jeff and mine that um, we would prevail In the trial we had a 12 day trial and the opposing attorney, uh was asked a question by judge walker and it said, I want you to tell me the harm that allowing gays and lesbians to marry would cause opposite sex couples. And then he said probably the three most famous words of the 12 day trial when he looked up at the judge and said I don't know. That was the moment that we knew we had won. We hadn't really ever sat down and really talked about marriage because we just always assumed that we would never have the right and when you assume that you'll never have the right, its engrained. Its almost engrained in our community, we just allow discrimination to happen, and we fight it, and we speak up, but you just accept it. Because you're always going to be that minority. And when people ask the question, do you think marriage would change your relationship after 12 years we can finally say yes, it changes everything. it makes everything better. And it actually really defines your relationship and solidifies everything that you think about your relationship becomes more real in those moments -We could empathize with each other we could share the frustration, we could share the pride, we could share the joy we could share the anxiety together and that...that part of our relationship and the foundation that had been built upon for you know, over 8 years at the time that we became involved in this case, the foundation just got stronger I can remember being gay as long as I can remember being alive and um, thats how naturally organic it is in me -I've known I was gay as long as I can remember. I don't ever remember anything other than that I remember being petrified of it I remember not knowing what it meant, I remember not knowing if it could be changed um, and then I remember realizing that that this was who I was We lived for so long in hiding. And we really climbed this ladder on rungs built by those who came before us people who really put their lives at risk to be who they are. And we live in a time now where we can be more open and if we can we should take that privilege and we should use it because you have to remember that you can get on an airplane and go someplace else in our country and in our world and get off that plane and not have that privilege And so when you have it, use it and I think thats a big part use your voice, and be a part of your community I dream that we don't have to keep doing this. I dream that every bother and sister in our community across the country and in the world can actually live their lives. And live their lives in a way that they don't have to feel discrimination or fear or regret that they can just be who they are because the things that affects us most recently I think is how many young people you hear about committing suicide or, you know, running away, and living on the streets and that sort of stuff because they're trying to just be who they are and we don't know if that one kid who killed themselves could have cured cancer, or made a major difference in this world. And the only reason they're not here any longer is because of discrimination. Its because of someones fear about their lifestyle and it really neglects the person and labels them based on some bias or discrimination against what they fear and so I dream of a day where kids like myself and like Jeff and could grow up and not have to worry about that. I think we live in a world of dreams I think when you think of the struggle that the gay and lesbian community has gone through, and you think of the word dream as we continue to grow and as we continue to um, evolve as a people, and as a nation then the dreams of Harvey Milk, and the dreams of Bayard Ruston, and those who came before us, um, we're living those dreams today for them and I'm hopeful that we will live in a world very shortly where the dream of equality for the gay and lesbian community is a reality but, if that does not end up being the case by the time we leave this earth then we hope that the next generation of gays and lesbians will live our dreams for us Edie Windsor, who goes without saying um, she had to be in the OUT100 this year, it would have been a crime not to have, not to give Edie Windsor a cover. -Edie gives a lot. She gives her heart, and she gives her story she wants to share -Many people came to know Edie because of the documentary Edie and Thea and to learn about them OUT actually published one of the first stories about Edie um, in its love issue, um, a few years -I really believed in love, more than I ever had. When I read her story. My names Edie Windsor, thats easy, however, they tell me that when I was a little kid, and people would ask me my name, I always said, I don't know Edie. I guess we're here because I sued the government, and okay and so suddenly became very well known everywhere. Adolescence who fall in love for the first time okay, are uh okay, know that theres a future My god, you know think, oh, you know, marriage equals equality in marriage uh, the kids of of gay people don't have to apologize for their families anymore, well they're married thats why I know when Thea and I got married the next morning felt different and then I started asking everybody who had been in a long-term relationship and then gotten married, how did it feel the next day, and everybody said the same thing, different. We could be who we are It was an unbelievable love affair, okay? I guess it was very believable. Uh and uh, and very close to the end, she said, you know we were so lucky, okay, you know like we're still in love and I said, you were lucky, I was persistant, haha, okay? Because she was a little sure that, you know that I was you know, gonna be anything very serious long-range, or anything like that in her life, uh, and she gave me a rough time. I built that harpsichord okay during our first dating year, when she was all for me, and then break a date, okay lie about what she was doing okay, because she could not go on the vacation we had planned and stuff like that and I said I'm not gonna sit and wait for that woman to call me, and at the time you could buy a kit, okay and the kit was not trivial it took me a whole year to build the damn thing uh, ultimately she invited me for a weekend in her country barn and, uh and, but, at the time I was up to where you had to you had to hammer weights into the keyboard, and you cant do that in a New York apartment so I brought my lead and my hammer and my keyboard and actually, shes waiting for this great romantic weekend, and, you know I'm busy with my keyboard uh, but, uh the, uh we met in 63, we didn't date till 67, till 65, and we became engaged in 1967 First of all, I was a good kid I really was. And I I dated a lot of boys when I was young uh, I had crushes on girls I didn't take them seriously till I was old enough I guess to take them seriously, and then I was terrified Uh, I didn't want to do that I didn't want to be that, I didn't know you could live okay, any kind of life like that My sister became, who had been I was her baby sister, and always, you know, we cherished each other at some point, she became increasingly homophobic, and uh, a friend of hers all her friends knew me, cause I was this little kid, growing up, next to them, you know, and uh, and a friend of hers, that I knew quite well said, you know, do you think it would be alright if I called Edie, turns out my daughter's gay, and shes very lost and Edie seems so together about everything. And my sister said, how do you know Edie's gay? and, the woman told me this all afterwords, and she said, well your mother told me! haha, okay? How did my mother know, okay? she didn't really, my mother walked around in the world, my brother in law then told me, she walked around in the world saying oh, the rapport between those girls, the love in that house, okay so, only my mother could not know the word lesbian, okay These kids ask very sincerely you know, how do you know its the right thing? I wanna have, you know, a and, to them I answer to that is, always if it lasts through two years they used to say, all seasons twice okay, cause the lesbians used to be, you know, what does a lesbian do on the second date, she brings a uhaul okay, if its as deliriously happy the second spring as the first, okay? keep going, okay? and if its not, stop! Okay? you know, don't bring the the uhaul probably the single most important thing with the longevity, or to loving altogether is caring as much about the quality of the other guys life as about your own. Why is the OUT100 important because it is a its an opportunity for us to acknowledge and honor um, the extraordinary work that so many people do -The more people that we have, that have a voice, and get their voice out the better off the community is -The whole point of the OUT100 is to demonstrate to the greater community the world that LGBT people are out there -That is a very powerful symbol to every- body, straight, and gay um, that you can achieve your dreams, you can fulfill your desire. Um without having to compromise on your sexuality and and Identity. -The more opportunity we have to break down myths, and to make things accessible and tangable not scary, and real all of that is vital to the progression of our community -I really think that the OUT100 for me, has been about learning the diversity of things that people are capable of despite what many would see as a handicap -We are fighters and we are visionaries -Legends in their lifetime, like Edie Windsor those are important people, but this is also about the many people you never hear about or never see. -We will continue to thrive, and we will continue to fight and we deserve to be treated like anyone else -what the OUT100 does for a lot of people is show that being um, being gay, is actually less of a handicap and more of an asset that actually allows them to be able to succeed in ways that maybe they didn't understand
