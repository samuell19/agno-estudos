[dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] Hey, sweetie. Don't forget your lunch is in the fridge. Mom, how long are you gonna keep This acceptance letter up? Oh, until the frame I ordered for it comes. You're joking. What? I can't be excited that my daughter Got accepted into an ivy league school? Of course you can, but we don't even know if I'm going yet. 'They haven't announced the winner of the scholarship.' Come on, honey. You're a shoe in. And besides there's not that much competition. It's just the other students who got into kenzer. Six other students that I know of That all have similar gpa and resumes to mine. That may be true, but they don't have your character. You're have to say that. You're my mom. (marianne) doesn't make it any less true. (Hanna) 'well, if I don't get it, staying in state' 'and going to palm vista with Scott wouldn't be so bad.' 'we have done everything together since we were 5' 'so, why should college be any different?' Okay, if by chance Some grave miscarriage of justice happens And you don't get the full scholarship I will find a way. I don't want financial aid, mom. We talked about this. It's not gonna come close to covering it all. We'll take out a second mortgage on the house. Or I'll work extra shifts till I'm 50. You are going to your dream school, okay? Just have to have faith. Okay. [car horn honking] That's Scott, I gotta go. Oh, here. Don't forget this. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Love you. - I love you. [upbeat music] God, I love your mom. How did your study date go? That good, huh? [laughs] - 'So, nice sunglasses.' - 'what?' (Hannah) 'looking to work some magic with the ladies today?' (Scott) 'I-I mean, yeah. Maybe. I don't know.' 'shut up.' You're too picky. Hey, there's nothing wrong with having standards. No, there's not, but there's not a girl On this planet that's gonna meet yours. Of course, there is. I'll see ya. [indistinct chattering] Hannah, principal Edwards wants to see you in her office. [instrumental music] Sorry to keep you waiting. - Have a seat. - Is everything okay? [sighs] well.. As you know, one of our school's most prestigious alums Elaine hemmingsworth, funds a scholarship each year Through her foundation, and awards it to one of our seniors. This year was the toughest competition we have ever seen. There were 11 students who were eligible And it was a very, very close race. So no one should feel like they're lost Because just getting accepted to kenzer university is a huge win. Yeah, I-I understand. That being said, I am pleased to inform you That her foundation has named you As the scholarship recipient. What? - Oh, my gosh! Thank you! - Congratulations. Oh, my god. Hannah. I'm so proud of you. - That's amazing! - Thanks. Honestly, feels like a huge weight has been lifted. I didn't think I'd be able to go. What are you gossiping about? Hannah. She got the hemmingsworth scholarship. - What? Are you kidding me? - Mm-hmm. - That's so awesome. - Thanks. I mean, it's not awesome that you're abandoning me. Oh, my gosh, I'm not abandoning you. We'll keep in touch. I know. I'm just messin' with ya. At least, I'll still have Jane to torture. Yeah, thank god my mom died Just in time for me to be hannah's replacement for you. - That's not what I meant. - I'm kidding, Scott. It's just a little dead parent humor. That's what you get for thinking I'm gonna be At your beck and call for the next four years. I thought you liked palm vista? I do, but I'm still waiting To hear back from my other choices Including my parent's Alma mater. Okay. Well, what's your top choice? I don't wanna say 'cause I don't wanna jinx it. And I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to afford it, so.. Well, when you do get in, which I know you will Let us know and we'll celebrate it! Deal! Speaking of celebrating. Let's go out tonight to celebrate your big news. - Okay. Sounds good. - Yeah? Yeah. (Hannah) 'mom, mom, mom, mom, mom!' - I got the scholarship. - You did it! I told you, you'd get it, right. Oh! Who is that? - Hi. - Hi, um.. I'm josh, I'm your new neighbor. Oh, yeah, hi, I'm marianne Davis And this is my daughter Hannah. Good to meet you both, um.. Nice to meet you. I was told there's a package... Oh, my gosh, yes. It's right here, actually. It came few weeks ago before I moved in. - Wonderful. - Yeah. It's great, um.. Well, I don't wanna take up too much of your time. Uh, it's a pleasure meeting you both. Um.. If you ever need anything, just right there reach out. - Great. Thanks. Same. - Yeah. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. He was nice. Mm-hmm. What? No, nothing. What is that look? [upbeat music] Watch how it's done, ladies. Wow. Yeah. That was a good one, you gotta teach me that. - My hand slipped. - Right. Jane, are you buying this? - Jane? What do you mean what? - What? You've been glued to your phone since we got here. Sorry, I overheard some kids at school today Talking about this new clique app So I decided to check it out. And it's totally addicting. Clique? What's that? A dating site? No. It's so much better than a dating site. It's like, it's like a-a chat room for people That talk through forums Or as the app calls them "cliques." Where you can talk about specific interests like Music, hobbies, sports. And they have cliques different colleges too So you can to people before you even go there. Wait, that's a good idea. Do they have one for kenzer? Oh, I'm sure they do, but let me check. Yeah. See. They do, you should totally join. - So cool. - Hey, I have an idea. (Scott) 'instead of trying to find friends online' How about you both put down your phones And attention to the amazing friend that is standing Right in front of you, waiting for you to bowl. 'It's your turn. Come on.' Here, give me your phone. I'll download it for you. Thanks. Now that, I believe, is how it's done. No, please. Don't stop on my account. You've got nice moves, Davis. And that's what you get for gloating. - You're up, Jane. - Here. I created the username for you. And I used your usual profile pic. You've got to be kidding me. "All the good names r taken?" - Seriously, Jane. - What? I knew you'd pick something totally boring And you gotta grab people's attention With something a little more fun. Whatever. I'm changing it. No! It's a conversation starter, okay. Just trust me. Okay, fine, I'll keep it for now. [laughs] Now that is how it's done. [eerie music] [Hannah panting] [Hannah shrieks] Eli? You scared the crap out of me. I thought someone was chasing me. Oh, right. You sure you weren't running because you're a coward And just didn't want to face me? What are you talking about? Don't play coy. You know what I'm talking about. The scholarship. Principal Edwards told me that I was the runner up Which we both know isn't fair. I have a higher gpa than you. I have a 4.0, just like you. Yeah, but you don't take ap calculus like I do. Other schools weight the classes different... That's one class. The scholarship is based on more than academics. - You and I both know that. - Oh. Right, so, you think you're a better person than me too? You think just because you're a brown noser Who sucks up to the teachers, that makes you more deserving.. Hey, man, mind your own business. This is my business, eli. I think it's time for you to get outta here. Eli, just go. Not a chance, sweetheart. We both know the winner isn't set in stone yet And I've worked too hard for this. Are you threatening her? Yeah, what if I am? What are you gonna do about it, huh? Scott, I can handle it. That's what I thought. So whipped. You'll never be anything More than her friend, right? - Scott, no! Let it go. - Scott, no! Let it go. Are you okay? What a jerk!

[cell phone chimes] Who's that? - A new friend I met. - From last night? (Hannah) 'kinda.' Jane showed me this new app called clique. And there was a kenzer clique, so I joined it And I met this guy named James. He's starting in the fall and he's gonna be prelaw too. Hannah, come on, you know how I feel About you talking to people online. I mean, your friends are one thing, but, uh Total stranger in a chat room... A kenzer university chat room, mom. Still, you know anything about them... Relax, I'm not gonna give him my phone number or my address Or even my last name. He doesn't even live here, so I'm not gonna meet him Until I'm actually at kenzer. Which really wouldn't be any different Than just meeting him on campus. Everyone is a stranger until you get to know them, mom. [car horn honks] Oh, I gotta go. [upbeat music] (Greg) 'get out of the car. I'll talk about this..' (Jane) 'yeah, you never wanna talk about this.' (Greg) 'I don't wanna talk about it, I'm busy!' - Get outta the car... - I can't stand you, Greg! (Greg) fantastic! We're on the same page. Have a great day! - Hey, guys. - Hey. How come your dad drove you today? Greg is not my dad! He's my stepfather, and he's an asshole. Well, he can't be that bad, he gave you a ride to school. No, trust me. He is. The only reason he adopted me Is because my mom wanted him to And then when she died Let's just say we're both counting down the days Until I turn 18. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. No, you're good, that was my bad. Um, I'm actually glad I ran into you. - You are? - Yeah. I wanted to congratulate you. I heard you won that scholarship. - Oh, yeah. Thanks. - Yeah. I'm actually going to school on the east coast too, you know. - 'Really? Where?' - 'Hudson university.' So, we'll basically be neighbors. Cool. I'm so sorry. I, I gotta go. Oh, it's alright. I'll see you later. Hey, what's the big emergency? Oh.. False alarm. Sorry. I thought I was gonna have to borrow Your history book for class, but.. I found mine. I gotta go. [instrumental music] (Jane) 'you know why he told you he's going' To Hudson university, right? - He's interested in you. - 'what?' - No, he's not! - Yes, he is. - He's with Lexi. - Correction. Was with Lexi. I heard they broke up like, two weeks ago. Wait, really? Why? I don't know. Who cares? But now you can be with him. - You're crazy. - No. I'm observant. Thank you. And I'm sure if mr. Poor timing over here didn't Ruined the moment, he probably would have asked you out. Hey! My timing is perfect, thank you very much 'cause Hannah can do way better than Kevin. (Scott) 'he isn't even her type.' Right. Handsome, charming, rich. What else could she possibly want? I'm not even his type, anyway. I'm the anti-thesis of Lexi. Well, that's good, because he just dumped her. Which means that's not what he wants anymore. And you guys have always been a little flirty with each other. And, as he made a point to tell you You guys are gonna be in the same city next year. I'm just saying. (marianne) 'you know, I think Jane is right.' I think this Kevin boy has a crush on you. Maybe. - You have a picture? - Yeah. I know you do. Let me see. - He's so cute. - Right. He is. Oh, wait. I know his dad. I work with him. - Wait, really? - Yeah. Oh, his dad is really cute. - Mom. Okay, okay. - What? He is. [dog barks] [cellphone chimes] [cellphone chimes] [eerie music] [knocking on door] [intense music] Hey, what are you doing? Mom, you scared the crap out of me. I thought you were in bed already. (marianne) 'I was, I was just' 'getting a glass of water.' Try and get some rest, sweetie. Okay. [dramatic music] [indistinct chattering] (Hannah) hey, guess what? Apparently, my mom knows your dad. They work at the hospital together. Already talking to your mom about me, huh? That's a good sign. Uh, no! I mean.. Yeah, I was, but not like that. You're cute when you blush. Never mind. Hannah, wait. I'm just messing with you. I like that you were talking to your mom about me. Listen, we got interrupted last time So I didn't get a chance to ask, but.. Would you maybe wanna go out with me Saturday night? - Really? - Yeah. Why are you surprised about that? Um... I don't know. I-I just didn't think I was your type. Smart and beautiful is my type? So, what do you say? Um, yeah, okay. I'd like that. Awesome. Let me get your number, and we can Figure out the details later this week. Okay. [dramatic music] [metallic clanging] Hello? [grunts] [keys jingle] [cellphone chimes] - You need some help with that? - Ah, no, it's okay. Oh, my goodness, who is this? - That's goober. - Hi, goober. [indistinct chatter] - 'Yeah.' - 'so sweet.' We'll baby sit anytime. Okay, I'll take you up on that. (marianne) 'great.' (josh) come on, buddy. Come on. Come on, don't get run over. Morning, Hannah. Hey, mr. Myers. Oh, my gosh, what happened? Oh, I got knocked unconscious 'by the dumpsters when I was working late.' - Someone mugged you? - No. No, no, no. Uh, they didn't take my wallet or anything And I didn't see anybody. That's weird. What did the cops say? I didn't report it. I didn't want the school to think I was a liability You know, working late. It's fine. I got a hard head, anyways. Come on, girl, we're gonna be late. Well, I'm glad you're okay. Thanks. [breathing heavily] I can't believe you do this to yourself. Come on, you're doing great. I-I need a break. I thought we were coming out here For you to get kevin's attention Not to actually work out. Hey, Hannah. - I'll be right back. - Okay. [referee whistles] Hey, eli.. I'm sorry about the scholarship. Uh-huh. You're sorry enough to give me the scholarship? - What? No. - Well, then go away. Because you're the last person I want any pity from. It's not pity. I... I-I know, what you're trying to do, I do. But it doesn't change the fact that if you didn't exist My entire future wouldn't be in complete jeopardy right now. So please.. Just leave me alone. [instrumental music] - What was that? - Nothing. Come on. I gotta get my mom the car. [instrumental music] [faucet squeaks] [eerie music] Hannah, principal Edwards wants to see you in her office. Take a seat, Hannah. Mom, is everything alright? I'm afraid not. Ms. Young brought to my attention Your recent term paper on "wuthering heights." Okay. Something about it just didn't feel right to me. Your voice and vocabulary sounded different 'so I ran it through one of my software programs' 'that detects plagiarism and it immediately matched' 'with this paper by a grad student' 'that's published online.' You didn't even paraphrase from it. - It's word for word. - I don't understand. - This isn't my paper at all. - Hannah, it's identical. (Hannah) 'I've never seen this paper before in my life.' This is not the paper I turned in. Then why is this the only one I have with your name on it? I don't know, but I can prove it. I have it right here on my laptop. Okay, great, so maybe this is Just all some sort of misunderstanding. (marianne) 'I assure you, it is.' My daughter would never cheat. - What? - What's wrong? I can't find the file. I even checked the trash bin, it's gone. Well, as you know, the school has A zero tolerance policy when it comes to cheating. I have no choice but to give you a zero on the assignment. But this term paper is worth a third of my grade. Not only will that tank my grade 'but it'll put my scholarship in jeopardy.' That's the other thing. I'm obligated to disclose this incident to the foundation. I don't think it's gonna end well for you. 'I am sorry, Hannah.' I am going to set up a meeting with the foundation So you can go in directly and plead your case. What's the point? Without any actual proof, how is that gonna go Any better than it did with principal Edwards? Are you sure that you didn't save it to your jump drive? Or-or what about my desk top? Sometimes you do your homework on my computer? No, I didn't. I.. - Oh my gosh, mom, that's it. - What? I wanted to proof read it during study hall So I emailed it to myself. That way I could pull it up On the computer at the library. Please tell me you saved that email. I deleted it from my inbox But it should still be in my sent folder. Yeah. There it is. I'm gonna call principal Edwards. I'm gonna figure out who did this. (Jane) I don't get it, what does the janitor Being mugged have anything to do with your paper? Well, that's the thing, he wasn't mugged. He was just knocked unconscious. Okay, so.. So, that not a coincidence. He was knocked out for a reason. And I'm willing to bet whoever did it Is the same person that switched out my paper. So I just need to do is sneak into the security room Search the security footage And I'll find out who it was. Told her it was a bad idea. It is not! This will work. We just have to wait until lunch when the library's empty. But there's always a security guard in there. How are you gonna get him out? That's where one of you comes in. Don't look at me. I'm a terrible liar! He such a wuss. What do you need help with? [knocking] hey, there's someone trying to break into People's cars outside. (Edwards) what are you doing? It isn't me, principal Edwards. I swear. Yes, it is and I can prove it. How? You literally can't make out a face. If you zoom in you'll see a sweatshirt That says "kenzer university." The same sweatshirt that eli always wears. Are you kidding? Tons of people have the same sweatshirt. Not that they wear everyday. - Please, that could be anyone. - Stop! Both of you. Look, Hannah, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention But the way you went about it was completely inappropriate. You should have come to me first with your suspicion Instead of sneaking around. Now, I'm afraid that eli is right. Without a clear face to identify There is no way we can know who that is in the picture. [cackling] If I were you, I wouldn't look so smug, eli. Because if I find any evidence that that is you Or you've any involvement in this I will call the police. Am I clear? Yes, principal Edwards. Good. Now get outta here. Hey! Wait up! I wanna talk to you! - Don't ignore me! - Don't touch me! If you ever try and get me in trouble like that again... We both know that's you in that footage. No, it wasn't! And even if it was me, it still doesn't prove Who switched out your paper, Hannah. You would need actual footage from mrs. Young's classroom And there are no cameras in the classrooms. Interesting that you know that, don't you think? Not really. It's no secret that I'm smarter than you. The foundation doesn't seem to think so. Well.. Like I said, it's not set in stone, now is it? And if you keep doing stuff like.. Breaking into security rooms And making false accusations And causing scenes.. Then the only person you'll have to blame For losing this scholarship is yourself. So please, by all means.. Keep it up. You're just making things much easier for me.

Yeah, then we shouldn't sit here and dwell on the fact That she's not here to celebrate it, now should we? Right, just shack up with your new flavor of the month. Not like you cared about her anyways. Hey! If I didn't cared about your mother Then I wouldn't be stuck here Raising an ungrateful little brat. You leave me to fend for myself all the time, Greg! Yeah? Well, I gave you a life That your dad could've only imagined. [scoffs] God, I wish it was you that died in that accident. In two short months When you turn 18, you're no longer my problem And you and I never have to see each other ever again. See, I do remember birthdays. (Greg) have a great night. [vase shatters] [vehicle horn honking] [upbeat music] (Hannah) 'I can't believe eli's going to get away with it!' I mean, if that wasn't him in the footage Then why'd he try and stop me from finding it And rat me out like that? Yeah, that's crazy. Are you okay? Yeah. It's just... My stepdad. Where was he going anyway? Who cares. Sorry, I just really don't wanna talk about him, if that's okay. Yeah, okay. Just know that I'm here. Thank you. I appreciate it. Do you want another soda? - Sure. - Okay. Thanks. [cellphone chimes] - Here you go. - Thanks. Who's that? James, this guy I met from that clique app. We were having a lot of fun talking about kenzer next year But he started to get super jealous and weird When I told him about Kevin asking me out. Why? You guys never even met. I know. He apologized, but things haven't been the same since. To be honest, he's starting to make me uncomfortable. "I guess I'll have to get your attention another way." What the hell does that mean? Well, those are beautiful. Any secret admirers? It's possible. Now, I gotta say, I am already liking this Kevin kid. They're not from Kevin. James? Hannah, come on, you promised me that you Wouldn't give him your personal information. I didn't. I swear. I didn't even give him my last name. Well then, how did he know where to find you? I don't know, he must have looked it up Online or something. What does this mean? Well, I mean, tracking you down, sending you these. I mean, he's clearly not respecting The fact that you just wanna be friends. Oh, Hannah, look, I, I don't think that you should Keep talking to this guy. You're just encouraging him. Really, I mean it. [instrumental music] [cellphone chimes] - Hey. - Hey, cutie. - How's class? - It was good. - How was yours? - It was okay. [door creaks] [phone dialing] (woman on phone) 'hi, flower spot. How can I help you?' Yes, hi. I-I was just calling to get Some information on A flower delivery. [cellphone vibrates] Phones away, please. Thank you. [cellphone vibrates] Thanks for the ride. Hannah, wait up. Look, I-I really don't think it's s good idea For you to be going out with Kevin. Why? I just don't think he's the right guy for you. You know, I heard some rumors and it sounds like Lexi may have been the one to dump him Because of the way he treated her. Since when do you listen to rumors? Besides, lexi's probably the one who started this to save face. Maybe, but.. I mean, they just broke up. I mean, don't you think it's kinda fast For him to move straight on to you? I just-I just don't want you to get hurt. I appreciate the big brother act But I'll be fine. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. (marianne) hey, listen honey, we need to talk. I spoke with the florist this morning. They have no record of those flowers being delivered. What do you mean? They spoke with all their drivers None of them delivered flowers to this address. Well, then who delivered them? Well, uh, the lady said that Since there's no record That they were an in-store purchase So whoever bought them, delivered them. But that's impossible. James doesn't even live in California, mom. - He lives in Ohio. - Or so he told you. Well, why would he lie about something like that? I don't know, honey, but if he's lying about this What else is he lying about? [gasps] 'What?' I didn't tell you because I wasn't totally sure But I had this really scary feeling That someone was in the house the other night. - Wait, what? - It was late. And I was hearing noises. And I could've sworn someone was there But when I checked, no one was. Hannah, you should have told me! It was the middle of the night and I was tired. I thought maybe I was making it up and being paranoid, but.. What if it was James? [sighing] - What are you doing? - I'm calling the police. (detective Wilson) was there any sign of forced entry? (Hannah) no. Was anything missing? No. Did they potentially leave anything behind? No. Did you see anyone Inside or outside of your home? No, it was dark but I've been getting These aggressive messages And I swear I heard someone in the house that night. (Wilson) 'I'm afraid without any hard evidence' 'there isn't anything I can do.' Well, what about the fact That he showed up at our home? It's not a crime to deliver flowers, ms. Davis. And there is no proof that he actually entered your home. Besides, your daughter said it was late. I mean, maybe it all was just a bad dream. Listen, he-he lied about where he lived? You're not even gonna look into it? Ms. Davis, if I spent my time investigating and arresting Every person who has ever lied on social media The majority of the population would be in jail. Look unless, he's done something to physically harm your daughter Or sent her a direct threat.. Well, I mean, he warned her that she was making A big mistake and that she would regret it. (Wilson) 'that's not a threat in the eyes of the law, ms. Davis.' Nowhere in any of his messages does he express any intent To cause any actual physical harm to your daughter. Look, my advice would be to just have her to delete the app. He'll get the point. Alright? Just don't speak to him again. He'll eventually move on. [dramatic music] Get those hands up. You good? Hey, give me one second. Hey, can I help you out? You don't recognize me? No. I'm sorry. Should I? What is this? I was hoping you could tell me. My name is Eric. Not James. I can't believe someone is using my photo like this. You're telling me this isn't your clique account? No. I've never even heard of the clique app until just now. I'm really sorry, but whoever you've been speaking to It hasn't been me. You're definitely getting catfished. [tense music] Hey, marianne. [josh sighs] god, that's terrible. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it's literally every parent's worst nightmare. This whole social media thing, it's, ugh.. The-the police won't help. So, now I have to find my own it expert To trace the account. Well, I'm.. Certainly no expert, but I do work in web development. So, if it's just a matter of tracing an ip.. Maybe I can help. - Really? - Yeah. - Thank you. That'd be great. - Sure. - I won't charge you too much. - Oh, great. - Ha-ha. Thanks. - Ha-ha-ha. (Scott) 'I mean, he could have been lying since you' Basically ambushed him. No. His social media basically told me it wasn't him. I just wanted him to confirm it in person. Plus, he doesn't even talk like James. Hannah. Is he seriously beckoning you? Oh, don't be like that. I'll be right back. - Hey. - Hey. Coach is wrapping up practice early But I just wanted to say goodbye And that I'll see you tomorrow at 7:00. (Kevin) I'm really looking forward to it. (Hannah) yeah, me too. - Cool. - See ya. Where did you go? Water fountain. Can we finish our workout now Or is Kevin going to interrupt us again? - Nope. I'm all yours. - Great. - Ready, set, go. Ha-ha-ha. - Come on! - Whoa! - Whoa! Whoa-whoa! You okay? Yeah. Thanks to you. I could have broke my neck. (Scott) someone intentionally tried to hurt you.

I tried tracing the ip address "James" sent the messages from But he's using a vpn to block it. What's a vpn? It's a software program that encrypts your ip address And re-routes it all over the world to keep your personal data Private and makes it harder to trace. - So, it can't be traced? - No, it can. It's just harder, and it will take more time. So, I gave it to a co-worker who has more experience with that. In the meantime, there were some messages That didn't go through a vpn. Maybe it's because he was communicating with Hannah On a different device from a different location He didn't have control of. So I was able to trace the ip address To those messages. Well, where did the messages come from? Hillside park high school. [tense music] (Edwards) 'well, just hold on one sec, okay?' Let me just transfer you to my cell. Are you there? Great. Uh-huh. Well.. Tons of students use those computers every day. They're open to the entire campus. Yes, but the kids log in to the computers With their student id and passwords, correct? That is correct, but all the computers use the same router So they'll all have the same ip address. It's not like we can just narrow it down 'to identify one specific one.' If I may interject, each computer's public ip address 'would be the same, that is correct.' 'however, each computer has its own private ip address as well.' 'I can give you that address and we would just need' 'the log in history of that one computer.' Once we have that, my friend can match the messages From whoever was logged into that specific computer At that specific time. Well, I'm afraid I can't legally disclose The entire log in list due to privacy reasons. But what I can do is, if you give me the private ip address And the exact time the messages were sent I will log in and look. (Edwards) 'does that work?' (marianne on phone) 'yes. Thank you. Thank you so much.' [suspenseful music] [sighs] [music continues] Give me.. [groans] [gasping] (mrs. Young) 'class, uh..' I'm afraid I have some tragic news. Your fellow classmate Eli Johnson, passed away yesterday. 'He had a peanut allergy.' 'unfortunately, he was in the library by himself' After school when it happened. The janitor found him, but just wasn't soon enough. 'The school has brought in grief counselors' 'on campus today for any of you that need to talk.' [tense music] (Edwards) 'I was able to gain log in access' 'on the computer that your mother told me about.' Although, in light of recent events I don't think it's important anymore. Why? Who was it? Um.. It was eli Johnson. [instrumental music] [cellphone chimes] Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Your mom heard from principal Edwards And asked me to check on you. Such an awful way to go. At least you're safe now. No, I'm not! James just sent me a photo of me sleeping in my room. - What? - He was in my house, Scott. Standing over me, as I slept. - Let me see it. - I can't. It was a chat flash, so it deleted after I opened it. You know what this means, right? Eli wasn't James. But he had to be. He was the one logged into that computer. Or maybe someone logged in as eli to frame him. Well, if it's not eli, then who the hell is it? (Hannah) 'whoever took that photo of me didn't break a window or lock' To do it, Scott. They knew how to get into my house. Which means they could do it again at anytime. Is your mom working a late shift tonight? She was supposed to, but she's getting it covered. She said she'd be home at 5:00. That's still two and a half hours away. I don't like the idea of leaving you at your home by yourself. Especially if someone knows how to get inside. I was thinking about going to the gym. You wanna come? I don't really feel like working out right now. Well, they have a pool and saunas. You could use those. Just... Try and relax. Yeah, okay. [dramatic music] [music continues] [thudding on door] (Hannah) hello? [beeping] Hello? Who's there? [door handle rattling] Hello? Hey! [grunting] Help! [beeping] [coughing] help! [coughing] [music continues] (Scott) 'hey, Hanna. I'm done.' 'you almost ready?' Hannah! Hannah, are you okay? Are you okay? Hey! Talk to me. You better? [tense music] (Marianna) 'are you serious? Okay.' What-what about any witnesses? Someone must have seen something. [sighs] Okay. Thanks. Well? The police can't find any witnesses 'who can recall anything.' (Scott) what about the security cameras? No, they-they wouldn't have them in that area. Are you sure that you didn't see anyone? No, when I went to check on her All I heard was um.. Pounding and-and the door was wedged shut. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. No, I.. Sweetie.. It's because of you that Hannah is alive. [phone ringing] It's detective Wilson. Yes? [instrumental music] Anymore hero talk And you'll impossible to deal with. - Me? - Hmm-hmm. Never. How you feelin'? Just grateful you were there. My mom's right. If you didn't come when you did, I.. What can I say? I have perfect timing. And I'm not letting you go anywhere. Okay? You're gonna have to put up with me for a long, long time, missy. Better get used to it. Sorry I wasn't there to help you. It's not your fault. I'm just glad Scott checked on me when he did. He seems to have convenient timing a lot, doesn't he? Don't you find it kinda weird that every time you've had One of these "episodes," it's been when you're with him? That he's always conveniently been there to help save the day? No, he hasn't. He wasn't there when we got hit by that car.. Yeah, but, I was the only one that was actually hit. Someone he clearly sees as a threat. Scott would never hurt anyone. I've known him my whole life. He's like a brother to me. That's the thing. I don't think he wants to be your brother. - I think he's in love with you. - What? No, no. Scott does not look at me that way. You're just saying that because you don't like him. Maybe. Look, I didn't mean to upset you. You're probably right. How about we stop talking about Scott And we focus on more important things? Like us. Sorry. Sorry. [cellphone chimes] [suspenseful music] - You okay? - Yeah. Isn't your next class on the other side of campus? Yeah, but I had to grab something from my locker Real quick. Why? No reason. I was just surprised to see you. - Okay. - Oh, actually.. I'm really glad you're here. Can I borrow your phone really quick? I forgot to charge mine, so it died And I wanna see if the neighbor emailed me about the vpn. Wouldn't he email your mom? Uh, he said he would email both of us. - Thanks. - Hey, guys. Um, are either of you up for studying 'for the history final tomorrow? 'cause I need to study.' Yeah, that final is going to kick my butt. - Could we do it at your place? - Yeah, sure. Hannah, you in? Huh? For studying at jane's after school? Oh, no, sorry, I can't today. Uh, you two have fun though. What're you doing? Oh, um, checking my email. [cellphone chiming] [knocking on door] [tense music] [knocking continues] (Jane) Hannah, it's me! Hannah! Hannah! [gasps] (Hannah) what is going on? Did you run here? Yeah, we need to talk. [panting] Where did you get this? Scott was over at my place and he was acting really weird So I snooped through his things and.. It's not all I found. Oh, my god. Kevin always thought it could've been Scott I just didn't want to believe him. Really? What did Kevin say? That he thought he was in love with me. And it wasn't a coincidence how all these "episodes" Happened when we were together. Makes sense. You kept focusing on eli and the fact that He was at the bowling alley the night we set up the clique app But so was Scott and that would be the perfect way For him to tell you how he feels But then you started dating Kevin.. Which he kept trying to talk me out of. But something about this doesn't make sense. If he has feelings for me it would make sense Why he wants to hurt Kevin, but why would he wanna hurt me? I don't think he wants to hurt you. I think he's just trying to create these scenarios Where he can be your knight in shining armor. But what about switching out my paper And almost costing me this scholarship? He didn't save me from that. He didn't even know I emailed to myself. If you lose this scholarship, you'll be going to palm vista.. With Scott. That's why he said he was sorry. What? He texted me like, 20 minutes ago saying he was sorry And when I asked what for, he didn't respond. What did he say when you confronted him? I didn't confront him, I just came up with an excuse And then came here immediately. He's at my house alone right now, Hannah. But if he texted you, that means he knows I have his things. - Where are you going? - To confront him. (Jane) 'Hannah, I don't know if that's safe.' Don't you think we should call the cops first? Yeah, I will, after I talk to him. Oh, my god. What're you doing? Well, I'm not going to let you go alone. If you're going to do something crazy like this I'm gonna be your back up. - His car's not here. - No. He parked in the garage because greg's not home. [gate creaking] [tense music] Do you hear that? Scott? It's me, Jane. I need to talk to you. Scott, it's Hannah! [smoke-alarm beeping] (Jane) 'Hannah, I have a bad feeling about this.' [beeping continues] [coughing] [intense music] Oh, my god! Scott! - Scott! Wake up! - I'll call 911. I need you to wake up for me. Come on, Scott! Wake up! [music continues] [siren wailing] - That's my daughter. Hannah! - Ma'am, ma'am... Oh, my god! You girls okay? It was Scott. Scott was James the entire time. What? No, that-that can't be true. (Wilson) 'I'm afraid hannah's right.' We found scott's phone in his car. It was, uh, open to the notes app. He, um, he'd written a suicide note on it. So, this is my fault? If I hadn't taken his phone... "the thought of you moving across the country "was too much for me to bear. "I've always been in love with you, Hannah. "I just didn't know how to tell you. "So I decided to show you. Try to make you see me in a different light." [instrumental music] 'Admits to all he did.'

'He's not a good person, Hannah.' Maybe, but neither are you. Look, I never said we were exclusive. You're right. You didn't. But you also weren't completely honest either. - Hannah... - Bye, Kevin. - Hey. - Hey. That didn't look good. - What a jerk. - Mm. - You know what we should do? - Hmm? Let's have a girl's weekend. Greg's out of town and you could come over And we can take your mind off of things. - Yeah. - Yeah? (marianne) 'as you can imagine' 'it's been a very stressful time for Hannah.' 'she's been emotional and..' 'uh, in no way reflects her usual performance.' 'yes, ye.. Yes.' 'that is more than fair. Thank you so much.' 'and please thank the other foundation board members' 'for me as well.' [sighs] Was that the hemmingsworth foundation? Yeah. Look, principal Edwards called earlier.. The foundation's board is really concerned With your recent grades. They're threatening to take the scholarship away. - Let 'em. - What?! Let 'em. I don't care! I don't want this scholarship anymore. Hannah, you don't mean that. Yes, I do! That scholarship almost cost me my best friend! 'After everything I've been through' Do you really think I care about some dumb scholarship? I know you that you feel that way right now. But that is just the anger and grief talking. You-you will feel differently eventually, trust me. 'I called the board and they said that' 'you can keep the scholarship, if you can maintain' '3.5 grade average, the first semester of college.' Wow! Because a gpa is what matters most right now.

I'm just having a hard time Wrapping my brain around this whole thing. It just doesn't sound like Scott. Yeah. He fooled us both. I wish I could just talk to him. Get some answers. But he gave the answers in the suicide note. Something about it just doesn't feel right. I mean, we now know he had a reason not to like Kevin. Maybe he really was just being the protective best friend.. What if the phone wasn't even his? What if he found out who James was and he took it from them? Hannah.. I know you don't want to believe that scott's capable of this But, people do really crazy things for love. [doorbell rings] Oh. I think that's the pizza, I'm gonna go get it. Okay. [tense music] Damn it. Are you kiddin'? Tons of people have the same sweatshirt. [music continues] (Jane) I'm still waiting to hear back from my other choices Including my parent's Alma mater. [josh knocking] marianne, it's me, open up. [knocking] It's josh. Please, open up. Josh, what's wrong? I just heard back from my co-worker. He finally managed to trace the address and marianne.. It's not Scott. [intense music] [exhales] [Hannah on voicemail] 'hi, it's Hannah. Leave a message.' Where're you going? My mom texted me. She needs me home. Looks like your mom didn't teach you about Going through people's things. (Jane) just like Scott. I didn't want to do it. But I didn't have a choice. [intense music] I need you to go to the police station Ask for detective Wilson and tell them everything you know. - But... - Just go. - Just do it. - Okay, okay. (Hannah) 'you were talking about going' 'to your parent's Alma mater.' 'you were talking about kenzer.' This is about my scholarship, isn't it? No. It's about my scholarship. What are you talking about? Eli was the runner up. Yeah, he was. But I knew I couldn't be far behind So I snuck into principal edward's office And it turns out I was the second runner-up. Me. He just had to go. (Hannah) you killed eli? (Jane) it's not my fault he has allergies. What about James? (Jane) I created James for you to lose focus. Create just enough drama in miss perfect's life. [line ringing] Come on, pick up! [dramatic music] Hannah, where are you? Pick up! No scholarship is worth the things you've done. No, Hannah. See, that's where you're wrong. To you, kenzer's just another ivy league school, right? Yeah, but to me, it's so much more than that. I grew up with my mom and dad telling me stories About how they fell in love there. I was gonna go there and follow in their footsteps. I was gonna feel close to them when I went to kenzer. And you stole that from me. No, I didn't. You can still go to ken... No, I can't, Hannah! You don't get it! You don't get it, okay? [crying] I don't qualify for enough financial aid. Okay? Because my stepdad makes too much money But he's not gonna help me at all because Once I turn 18, I'm not his problem anymore. [instrumental music] I don't even know if I'm gonna have a place [slurred] to live in the next few months. [slurred] Hannah? Hannah? Good, right? - You drugged me? - 'I did.' That's the whole reason I brought you here. [low pitched] it's only a matter of time, Hannah. (Jane) 'where're you going, Hannah?' 'there's nowhere to go!' 'ready or not' 'here I come.' [intense music] 'You can't hide from me, Hannah.' [intense music] [music continues] Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Baby! (marianne) 'baby, come on.' [grunting] Okay. You gotta wake up, baby. Wake up! - Wake up, baby. - Well.. If it isn't super mom coming to save the day yet again. Whatever this is about, we can fix it. This is your fault, you know? 'If you would have just let Hannah get away' With her grades slipping, and her cheating None of this would have happened. I would have gotten my scholarship And your daughter wouldn't have gotten hurt. No one would've gotten hurt. But you just keep getting in the way, being the perfect mom... The police are already on their way. It's over. We've all made mistakes. We can walk out there together. I promise I will try to protect you... No, because I won't be going to kenzer! No. No, I'm sorry, you won't. You don't get it. You don't get it at all. I'm doing this for my mom and dad. I'm doing this to make them proud. I need to go to kenzer to make them proud! There has to be another way. There's nothing... I'm sorry, mama Davis. I really did like you. [dramatic music] [both grunting] [yells] [water splashes] [both gasping] [intense music] [groans] [marianne coughing] [grunts] What's going to happen to Jane? Well, she is going to be in a world of trouble.. But hopefully now, she'll get the The mental help that she needs. She was right about one thing. I shouldn't take you for granted, mom. - I'm sorry. - Oh, sweetie. (marianne) 'what's gonna happen next, but..' - 'hey, sweetie. Oh..' - 'hi.' Are you ready for some good news? Yes, please. Well aren't you a sight for sore eyes. How are you feeling? I'm good. Your mom told me everything. I'm so sorry I wasn't there to help you. Scott, I'm so sorry For ever believing it could have been you. That fake note about you having feelings for me 'should have been a dead give away.' - Wait, I'm... - Don't worry, Hannah. I don't expect you to feel the same way. I need you in my life, Hannah. Even if it's that's just as friends. That's enough for me. Really. Well.. What if that's not enough for me?
