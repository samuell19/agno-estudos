If you paid for your tickets, grow straight ahead. Thank you. * Welcome. * * Philadelphia, please put your hands together for my man, Aries Spears. Philly, what's happening? You good? My God. Well, you know what's funny, those of y'all that know me know I'm a big Jay Z fan. I hope I get to be that famous before my career is over. 'Cause this motherfucker has surpassed being a rapper. He's a rock star. Like, you know you're huge when you can sell out Africa. He could fill a soccer stadium in Africa and they hold between 80,000 and 100,000 people. He could sell that shit out by himself. Like, don't get me wrong, DMX and Ice Cube is cool, but they're not selling out Africa. Jay Z is a master showman. He's a game changer. Which means he ain't gonna just perform to perform. He gonna do some shit to change the situation 'cause he know they starving out there. Like, he'll probably do some fly shit like halfway during the show. Have helicopters fly over the arena and drop bags of rice into the crowd. Like, how gangsta would that be if he was like, * It's your boy, Young Hove and you know how I'm nice * * I know you hungry, niggas Rice * Rice just fall into the crowd and shit. All the Africans would be talking about this shit. "Bukembe, I went to the Jay Z concert. The motherfucker drop bags of rice into the crowd. When he said, 'Put your hands in the air,' he meant for you to catch dinner. My God. Thank God." It's the Roc. Sweetheart, up here. Beautiful black girl, right there. White top. Are you having a good time, love? Okay, well then laugh, goddamn it. Show me some. Every time I look at her, she looking at me like she my goddamn parole officer, nigga. This... I hope you don't beat your man dick with that same energy. I know I'm funny, bitch. Catch up. My God. You see the evil face on this bitch? I bet you your pussy taste like cold French fries. I wish you could see the shock on these white folks' faces. This shit is hysterical. They looking like, "My God. This is what they talk about." Don't worry. This is how niggas talk. I love her. Big shout-out to all the niggas who came here with white women. Where the niggas with the white girls? Represent. Nigga, you know I'm talking to you. Raise your motherfucking hand, nigga. This ain't TV, nigga. I see you. This nigga lookin' at me like he about to change the channel. "This nigga's confrontational." Ain't nothing wrong with it, baby. It's 2016. Sometimes you need a little interracial love in your life. I don't even know why some people still get caught up into that shit. Like, I know some black women, not all of y'all, but some of y'all... Some of y'all get upset when you see brothers with white girls. Don't do that shit. It's unnecessary. Soon as you see a nigga with a white girl, you wanna call them out. "Fuck you... Fuck you doing with that white bitch?" It's like, are you gonna lick my asshole? "I don't do that." All right, then. Hello, white girl. Black women, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the motherfucking problem. Every now and then, a nigga need to get his asshole licked. I'm just saying. "Motherfucker, I ain't licking your asshole. What if it feel good, you clench up your buttcheeks, my hair get caught in your shit? I'm not XXX." And to the white women that don't know this, this is what black women do with their weave, this is how they scratch it. Some of y'all looking at me like, "My God. Why is he patting his head?" So the next time you go to work and you see one of your black female coworkers doing that, you already know. "My God, you're itching. No, no, no. The Negro told me. You're itching. Come here, Dasheeka." No, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that. You can't just randomly walk up to a black woman and start patting her head. Don't do that. What's your name, love? Sierra? Goddamn, nigga, you plucked straight from the tree, didn't you? That's a pure white bitch right there. Goddamn! That bitch is like uncut cocaine, nigga. That's pure. She probably told all her girlfriends, "You know, they giving these niggas away at Walmart. Black Friday, it's a steal." Let me ask you a question, Sierra. What's something you didn't know about black men prior to him, that when you got with your first black man, you found out some of our secrets, and you had to tell your girlfriends, like, "My God, girl. They wear so much coco butter and grease. They like to fuck with nothing but their ankle socks on." Every porno nigga be butt naked with white ankle socks. Niggas be trying to murder pussy. We need grip. What's your name, dog? - Mario. - Mario? Nigga, put some bass in your voice. You representing for all of us. You supposed to say that like your dick was heavy. "Mario!" Like you moving your shit in a wheelbarrow. "I'm gonna fuck the shit out this bitch. Soon as I get home, I'm gonna uncoil it." Mario, you guys incorporate the race game in your sex life? You have fun racially/sexually? You do that? You got to, dog. Don't make sense to date outside your race if you're not gonna play the race card. What's the point? I'm gonna give you some advice. If you ever feel like your relationship is getting stagnant, you gotta shake it up racially. So one day when you're on your way home from work, call your white gal up and be like, "Look, baby. I'm on my way home. Do me a favor. Leave the kitchen window halfway open. Be making some cookies." And you come up behind her with a ski mask, like, "Bitch, put some more chocolate chips..." She acting like she don't know you, but she read about you in the paper. "My God! It's the nigga chocolate chip cookie killer!" I understand your plight, my real. There's advantages to dating white women. I gotta go out to eat with a white girl I go out to eat with a white girl, the bill come, I try to pull my wallet out, she get offended. "Aries, no. No! Put your goddamn wallet away. It's my treat. Besides, it's Black History Month. Your people have struggled long enough. You shouldn't struggle." I go out to eat with a black woman, the bill come, we looking at the bill, and looking at each other. Like two cowboys facing off at noon. * Ooh, ooh, ooh Listen, I joke about it, but fuck it, man. You ain't gotta hear me say it to know how to do it. You're already doing it. Love who you love, do what you do, fuck what other people think. Life is short. Be happy, baby. I don't give a fuck if people date interracially. I just wish they would be honest about why they do it. 'Cause any time you ask somebody why they date outside their race they always give you that same bullshit generic answer. "Well, first of all, I don't see color. I'm just with whoever makes me happy." Which is bullshit 'cause nine times out of ten, when you date outside your race, you usually tend to date that race exclusively. Which means color is exactly what you see. But just be honest. There's a natural curiosity. If you're white and you date white, there's no mystery there. You know what comes with being white. Some white women are bold enough to be honest with you. They tell you the truth. "It's just something about black men that turn me on. It's just something different." And I get it, black men, we got style, charisma, flavor, swagger, the way we walk, the way we talk, we got a certain cool that come with being a nigga. It's automatic. I hear some of you white girls talk about us in the clubs with your girlfriends. "My God, Becky. Look at the way his body moves to the beat. He's so in sync with the rhythm. It's like it's tribal. I bet you he'd fuck me. He's like an angry loose monkey. Just fucking me with that huge nigger dick. Sucking me dry with those huge ladle nigger lips." White women, we talk about y'all the same way. We see a badass white bitch, we tap our boy. "Shit, nigga. Look at that white bitch. I bet you she looks sexy as hell at the bank filling out them loan documents. I bet you her FICO score is through the roof! She could cosign an Escalade for a nigga." Same kind of fantasy. You know what's interesting? I'm doing some of this and I hear a lot of you guys going, "Ooh!" Knock that shit off. This is not an insurance seminar. It's a goddamn comedy show. Like, it fuck me up when people get offended at a live comedy show. You gotta understand something. You going to go see a live comedy show is like going to go see a R-rated movie. You gotta prepare yourself to hear and see some wild, fucked-up shit. Like, comics, we say fucked-up words onstage all the time. I love it. I like saying words like "retarded," "nigga," "faggot." And let's be honest. We say these words, don't it make you feel good a little bit on the inside? It's kinda like hot chocolate. It just warm up your chest. Just a little bit. Plus, when we say these words, we don't really mean it that way. Nine times out of ten, it's an exaggeration, a figure of speech. Everybody in here, at one point or another, said the word "retarded." Your friends or your family do something stupid, make you laugh, you go, "Man, you retarded. Fucking retard." But we don't mean "retarded" retarded, like... And like, is it me, or don't all retarded people look alike? Fuck y'all, don't give up on me now, goddamn it. They all got that same expression. Like they just smelled hot naked ass up close. You ever see a retarded person eat peanut butter? That is a facial struggle. And what is it about retarded people in McDonald's? They love fucking McDonald's. You could be driving in your car and have a retarded person sitting next to you, they don't say shit the whole drive. They got their head up against the glass. They licking the window. Soon as they see them golden arches, they're like, "McDonald's!" Some of y'all tried not to laugh and I guarantee you, when you drive home tonight, as soon as you see them fucking arches, you gonna be like, "McDonald's!" Or take, for instance, the word "faggot." They say you shouldn't say that word. To a gay person, that's like calling them a nigger. First of all, women don't really use that word. It's really a guys' word. We say that to each other. "Fuck out of here, faggot. Fucking faggot." I think there are worse words a man can say than "faggot." Like the word "delish." Like, no man should ever say that word. Like, "Dog, how's that peanut butter cookie?" "My God, nigga, shit is delish!" Like, nigga, why did you dip when you said it? Or the word "tummy." No man should ever say the word "tummy." Like, if your stomach hurt, then goddamn it, just say your stomach hurt. I wish I would be around my boy, and I'm like, "Dog, what's wrong?" "Ooh! Nigga, my tummy." If you a grown-ass man, and you say the word "tummy" to another grown-ass man, you are a faggot. Just trying to say it's not what you say, it's how you say it. Words have no real meaning until you put the right or wrong execution behind it. Like, I'm gonna tell you something that a lot of men in this room will not admit to. But every man in this room at one point or another has either angrily or sarcastically told his boy to suck his dick. Y'all can look at me like you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about if you want to. We've all done that during the heat of an argument. You can be arguing about football, "Man, you don't know shit about football. Tom Brady is a much better quarterback than Peyton Manning. What you mean how I know? Motherfucker, I used to play football. Fuck me? No, nigga, fuck you! Man, whatever, nigga. Suck my dick!" There's nothing wrong with telling your boy to suck your dick. As long as it's a statement, not a question. Can't be like, "Fuck you, nigga! No, fuck you! Hey, suck my dick?" Can't leave that open for room for interpretation. Gotta seal that off. I'm just saying, words, they fit certain people in certain circumstances accordingly. Take for instance the word "bitch." No woman likes the word "bitch." No woman likes to be called a bitch. But, ladies, sometimes you do things that require you being called a bitch. Like, ladies, here's some shit y'all do that pisses every man off. And I know every man can attest to this. Ladies, how come in life you guys give us options, and then when we choose the option that doesn't best suit you, you take away the fucking options. Like, fellas, you ever take your lady out to a nice restaurant, they got indoor seating and outdoor seating, you go, "Hey, babe. Where you wanna sit?" "I don't care, you pick." "All right, let's sit outside." "Why you wanna sit outside? It's cold outside. We should sit inside." It's like, you fucking bitch! Shit is confusing. I hope whoever the next president is, they legalize weed. I don't understand why weed is still illegal. It's the most harmless vice on the planet. And I'm a weed advocate. I talk about weed so much on Facebook and Twitter, I get people to come up to me after my shows and hand me nickel bags, blunts, joints. I had a white boy one time give me some edible weed. I wish somebody would have told me that edible weed is 50 times more potent than the shit you smoke. And when white boys give you weed, they come with warning labels. You gotta listen to shit they say. I had a white dude give me five miniature Reese's Pieces size cups of edible weed. I was like, "Dog, is this shit even strong?" This white boy looked me dead in my face, he was like, "Dude, trust me. You do that, you're gonna see tomorrow today." Goddamn! I ate all five of the motherfuckers. I was driving home, I was like, "Man, this ain't shit." Cut to, I'm in my house butt naked... making carpet angels, nigga. My nuts had eight hours of rug burn. That shit was serious. I like to smoke weed and watch Maury Povich. That's how I start my morning, an Egg McMuffin, a blunt, and Maury Povich. I love them "who the baby daddy?" shows, man. That is black ignorance at its finest. Like, I don't understand how come when a nigga find out he ain't the father, he got to pop-lock and breakdance? "Terrell Jackson, you are not the father." "Told you, bitch." I like when the girl find out he ain't the father, and she take that long run down the hall. And just fall flat to the floor. Like, no disrespect to my big girls, but if you 250-pounds and you run at top speed, and fall suddenly to the floor, you looking like a baby elephant being shot in the wild. Toes and fat ankle meat all in the air. Look at all the big bitches. Fat chick leg look like gyro meat with a heel at the bottom of it. Fuck y'all, that is funnier than that. Next time you see gyro meat on a spinning spool, put a heel at the bottom of that. It's a fat chick leg, nigga. Look at all the skinny girls comforting they fat friends. "Girl, he ain't talking about you. Fuck him, he ain't talking about you." And I know some of you big girls going be mad at me and talk about me in the car on the ride home. "Why you laugh at what that nigga said? It's all good, baby, baby!" Skinny girls love that joke. Y'all go to work the next day and fuck with your fat coworker in their cubicle. "Why you keep making that noise?" "I just got something stuck in my throat, girl." "Baby, baby." Some of y'all with me, some of y'all trying to be polite. When you drive home tonight, it's gonna be you and your friend in the car, both of y'all gonna be making all them noises. Soon as the driver hit a red light, be... "Baby, baby." That's when the passenger join in. "McDonald's!" You know what's great about that joke? That is such an inside joke. No one outside this show tonight will know what the fuck that noise mean. Which means you could use that anywhere. You be in a grocery store and see a fat bitch in the cookie aisle buying one too many packages. "Was you talking to me?" "Go on, get the Oreo Double Stuf, girl. Baby, baby!" And I gotta give fat black women a round of applause. Yeah. 'Cause a fat black bitch will stick her ass into anything tight and be confident as a motherfucker. You ever seen a fat black bitch butt naked? My God! She got the same body as a baked potato. That shit... put your fork in the bottom of that motherfucker and hold it up. And when a fat black bitch walk in, follow her. Some of y'all wanna laugh, but you like, "I'm sitting next to this bitch." "Why he say baked potato?" She probably use sour cream for lotion. "Baby, baby!" I know, I know. I know. And I'm-a let you know some freaky shit about me. I got a foot fetish, baby. Ain't nothing sexier to me than a woman with good toe game. Ladies, if your toe game is up to par, and you ain't got no corns or bunions, I'll suck on a bitch toes. I swear to God, I will. But you got to have a good toe-to-foot ankle meat ratio. I don't do hoofs, nigga. I don't do hoofs. You put a hoof in my face, I be like, "You better put that motherfucker in a jar and sell it." Niggas know what that is. That pig feet right there. Some of the white people confused. There's an Asian girl looking at me and going, "Ooh, pig feet!" Put a little bit of sauce on it. My God. Feel good to be home. I was in Europe not too long ago. You don't realize how special America is until after you go abroad. Like, I'm a fan of the females in America, got something called options. I'm like, don't get me wrong, there's other races in Europe. But mainly it's Europeans. I'm looking in the show tonight, there's a lot of beautiful options. Black women, white women, Asian, Latino. See a couple of Indian girls sprinkled about. I gotta say, Indian women But Indian men! And it was weird 'cause I had my first show in Sweden, but I had a layover in London. And they actually had Indian people working airport security. Fucked me up 'cause they all had British accents. Totally threw me. "Excuse me, sir. Could you please put all your belongings in a tray and move it forward?" "Motherfucker, what?" 'Cause I'm from America. I'm used to, "Can you please put everything, and you got to..." And I was drinking a Slurpee at the time. I was like, "Nigga, you don't recognize it? The fuck you talking like that for?" And listen, bro, if you a black man and you into white women, you gotta go to Europe. We special out there. 'Cause ain't a whole lot of niggas in Europe. London is a major metropolis, a lot of niggas in London. But you go to southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Riga, Lithuania, there are no niggas out there. We're like a delicacy. We're like strawberry Kit Kats, nigga. We rare. And that accent shit work both ways. Men to women and women to men. 'Cause fellas, you could put the wrong woman with the wrong accent, that'll fuck you up too. Fucked around, had sex with a Jamaican broad recently. It's the scariest shit I'd ever done. 'Cause Jamaican women, by nature, are real fiery women. They're aggressive, passionate, spicy. She put the pressure on me sexually. It was too much. I couldn't handle it. "You want some of this pussy, boy? Nigga, you better get back there and mash it up. Don't fuck around, nigga. Mash it up. Mash it up. When you pull your dick out, you better come with the right amount of ammunition. Boo-ya-ka! Boo-ya-ka!" I was crying, I was like... "Quit your bloodclot crying, you pussy boy bitch." My God. Ain't no Middle Eastern people in here, is there? - Whoo! - My man, right there. - Where you from? - From Pakistan. Listen, if I said anything to offend you... I'm sorry. Me, you, damn the same. White people, fend for yourselves. I fuck with every race group, but I don't fuck with the Middle East. When them motherfuckers say they the bomb, they mean that shit. "You don't want to fuck with me, my friend. I am the bomb." I be nervous as shit. It's quiet in here, and all you hear is... Matter of fact, I need to see you laughing at all motherfucking times. Soon as shit don't be funny, he texting. "It is time." Matter of fact, if that nigga get up to pee, we all. I don't wanna hear shit about it. "Nigga, what are you doing?" "No, nigga, what are you doing?" Matter of fact, if you gonna blow somebody up... I went to Belgium. I was excited about that. 'Cause I'm an action movie fanatic. I know that's where Jean-Claude Van Damme is from. And ironically enough, I watched that movie on the plane ride over, Expendables 2. He plays the bad guy in the movie. He has a fight scene with Sylvester Stallone at the end of the movie. I thought Stallone and Schwarzenegger Was hard to understand. There's a moment just before the fight, Van Damme says to Stallone, "Don't try to 'shallenge' me." It took me 45 minutes to figure out that motherfucker was trying to say "challenge." "Don't try to 'shallenge' me." I said, "What the fuck is this 'shallenge'? Sound like a gay black male hairdresser." "My God, girl. Your hair is nice. Who did your shit?" "Shallenge." Like, I can't even believe Stallone and Schwarzenegger still making action movies. This motherfucker's 187 years old. And I'm a huge Sly fan. I love them Rocky movies. I'm waiting for them to come out with Rocky 48. I'll be right there. My favorite Rocky movie was Rocky III, when his trainer died. Not 'cause his trainer died. Just hearing Stallone cry for the first time was magical. Remember that scene in Rocky III, when he lose to Clubber Lang the first time? He goes back into the locker room and Mickey's laying on that cot. He's got that blanket over his chest. He's on his last breath. He's like, "It's all right... it's all right..." Stallone starts crying. "Mick! Mick!" You ever notice in the Rocky movies, whenever he starts out normal, you can understand him? But the more emotional he get, it just fucking lose you. Like, remember that scene in Rocky III when he's standing on the beach and he's all stressed and disheveled, and Adrian's like, "Rocky, what's wrong?" He's like, "Hey, yo, Adrian. I don't want it no more." "What are you talking about?" "When I first got in the ring, I didn't care what happened to me. I didn't care! But now it's you, the kid, I don't wanna lose what I got!" That's when Van Damme should have jumped out the water and said, "Don't try to shallenge!" Speaking of boxing, I used to wanna box. But fuck that, that's a brutal sport. It's a fucked up sport when you get your ass beat so bad you forget how to talk. I'm gonna tell you the boxer that scared me away from the sport, a lot of fellas might remember. Old-school boxer by the name of Riddick Bowe. This motherfucker was so fucked up, he did a interview, this nigga made up a word I had never heard. Like, "Riddick, after five years away, what made you think you could come back and be successful?" "Well, I feel like as long as I come back, train hard, believe in myself, and do everything I 'po' to do..." That nigga said "po to do." I said, he might not be able to fight no more, but he whoop ass in a game of Scrabble. I tell you... "Nigga, po to do? How many point that is?" I did that joke in Birmingham, they didn't get it. They're like, "Po to do? What wrong? That's a real word. 'Po to do.' What was he po to say? I don't..." And I following boxing to the core. I even follow them Spanish fighters, the ones that can't even speak English. And I love it 'cause they always bring in the interpreter to translate the Spanish to English. Some of them old-school black trainers need interpreters too. 'Cause Floyd Mayweather Sr... Like, I don't know how many of y'all really watch boxing or kept up on that show when it was on HBO, 24/7, but when Floyd Sr. talked, that motherfucker talk in fragments. It'd be like double dutch. I'd be trying to find my way into the conversation. Like, "Floyd Sr., what do you think of your son's chances to beat Manny Pacquiao?" "I tell him, I say look, Floyd! I don't give a fuck what... I that nigga daddy. Motherfucker, you... in that motherfucking ring. Hit that nigga with the four-five, brrr! He gone!" Did this nigga just go "brrr"? How the fuck do you spell "brrr"? Like, I would never think to put that in casual conversation. "Nigga, run down to the liquor store and get me a pack of Newports, brrr! Bring it on back." That's some old-school black man shit right there. And this nigga with that hat knows exactly what the fuck I'm talking about. You see that old nigga with the tilted hat? Yeah, nigga. What's your name, man? Yeah, nigga, you! What is it? Jason? Jason. Fuck that, nigga. You Cadillac Black. I know when you fuck your old lady, you ain't got nothing on but that hat and some black knee-high socks. Nigga hittin' it from the back, eating sunflower seeds. "Bitch, I done told you the dick was good to you." He be spitting the shells on her back. That's some old-school black man shit right there. Why do old-school black men talk and dance in place at the same time? "I told that motherfucker, shit, nigga come around here, show them niggas what it is. Them young niggas crazy. They get to shooting, cock, cock, brr! Nigga gone! Hit that nigga with the bowling stank." I used to have an uncle like that. This motherfucker would mispronounce everything. We'd be in the bar and shit, he'd be like, "Bartender, let a nigga get a double shot of that cog-nac. And let me get some of them nuts. I like them mick-ademia. I like them ca-jews. And what that one nut? The green nut with the cracked shell. Pis-ta-chio, nigga. Give it to me." "Uncle, that's pistachio." "Nigga, don't sneeze on me. Watch yourself." Lord. Some of y'all might have saw me not too long ago on ESPN SportsNation, they're not gonna have me back. I did a Michael Sam joke got me in a little bit of trouble. It was all over TMZ and shit. And it was weird 'cause some people said they didn't get the joke, which I didn't understand. 'Cause it really wasn't that complex. I said I went out and bought my first Michael Sam jersey, and it had 15 "S's" on the back. Sound it out real slow and make a gay face when you're finished. Sssssssssam! Fucking joke. I got love for the gay community. They had a phenomenal month way back. Gay marriage now legal all over the country now. Right? Yay. You know? I'm saying, it's 2016. Theoretically, we should be accepting of all things, theoretically. Like, I'm 41 years old. I'd like to know what it's like to be friends with a gay person. I got friends of all kinds. I don't have any gay friends. And I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm a little homophobic. And I'm scared, I don't know what to expect. If you've never had a friend of a different race or a different sexual preference, you go off your fears and your stereotypes. I'm sure there's some white guys in here, first time you hung out with a black dude, you thought to yourself, "My God. If we play basketball and he's on my team, we'll win." I see the Asian gentleman sitting right here. What's your name, sir? Dan. I remember first time I hung out with an Asian dude, I didn't know what to expect. I was like, "My God. If we get into a bar fight, and it's me and him versus 45 people, all I gotta do is step aside and let him do his thing." I was scared to have a gay friend. I thought, "What if at some point he try and fuck me?" And gay men get offended when they hear you say that. "Why you assume 'cause he gay he'll fuck you? You might not be his type." Then I got offended. "Word?" I thought dick and balls was the only requirement. I didn't know that height and eye color mattered. I didn't know that. 'Cause I thought all gay men was what you saw in the movies. The stereotype. They're not all like that. Some gay men are very macho, masculine men, tough guys. Look at this dude, Michael Sam. He don't act stereotypically gay. This motherfucker's a thug. He's hard. And that's the shit that worry me, 'cause I can't see that coming. What if I'm hanging out with my gay friend one day and I'm like, "My God. The weather is beautiful." He like, "I'm a suck your dick." "No! No, Sylvester. No. I don't want that." "Nigga, you don't have a choice." "OMG, nigga!" And what if he's stronger than me? Now we have a dilemma. Like, what if he rape me orally? I can't report that shit to the police. I look weak as a man. "Didn't you try and stop him?" "Yeah, but he had strong neck muscles." Somebody might walk in on us, thinking they interrupting a moment. "My God! I'm sorry!" "No, I need help!" This nigga's neck muscles are strong. Any gay people here? Hey. - What's your name, love? - Kate. Kate. Okay, Kate, let me ask you a question. I'm hoping you could help me out and put me up on game. 'Cause I'm a be honest with you. I'm ignorant to the fact, so I need you to school me. Can you help me, Kate? Okay. Like, I know when a man and woman have sex, we kinda know what's in each other's playground. We know what we fucking with. Like, a man could suck a woman's titties, eat the pussy, a woman could jack a man off, juggle his balls. Use peanut butter as a lubricant. I'm sorry, my personal shit, my personal shit. We can fuck in about five or six different positions. We know what we fucking with. Now, I would assume that when two women go at it, if nothing else happens, oral sex is a must. Like, that's almost a given. Correct? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. But then I wonder what happens past that. Is there ever any form of penetration at all? - Yeah. - Yeah, so maybe, like, a dildo, strap-on, something like that? - Yes. - She said yes. So that leads me to believe this. Really, y'all like dick. You just don't like what come with it. In other words, you like your shit a la carte. Have you always been strictly boneless fish? Yeah? Okay. So your flag planted. Pussy. So I got no shot. Damn! Well, can I at least referee? I'll pull your head away. "You're eating the pussy too hard." No, yeah, listen. The idea of two women going at it to a dude is like, whatever. Two dudes is... I don't know, I just think there's something a little mathematical about a man and a woman's body. It's almost like a puzzle. Like, everybody in this room, individually, sexually, has something that you are into that is downright filthy. Disgusting. No one knows how nasty this is but you and the Lord. Like, if anybody else knew what the fuck you was into, you would have to leave the country. I'm a tell you what my thing is. I am an aggressive snatch sniffer. I love to smell a woman's snatch. And I'm not talking delicate, like a wine cork, like... No. I get into the muzzle. I will wear a woman's pussy on my face like a surgical mask. And inhale till my ribcage shows. Have me making the Cosby face. Like, I like a woman's pussy to have a little mugginess to it. Not a bad smell... No, no, like a muggy, like a early morning, the sun's just coming up, you could smell the moisture off the grass from the sprinkler system. The coffee's percolating, the bacon... Like, the day is beginning like... "Good morning." I'm just saying as a straight man it's kind of hard for me to wrap my mind around that concept. 'Cause I am a fan of pussy. Like, I know all straight men love pussy. But I have a sickness for... Dear. Pussy is the greatest, most natural, single sense... Like, let's be honest. There's only four things in life that feel really good. Only four. Fucking, eating, getting high, and scratching an inside ass itch. Fuck y'all. Don't judge me. Don't act like I'm the only motherfucker that's ever felt pleasure from scratching an inside ass itch. You know it feels good 'cause when have you ever done it and not closed your eyes? And you hum a little bit. Who the fuck scratches an inside ass itch with they eyes wide open? It's one of the best feelings in life. But I'm saying, pussy, my God. Ladies, do you understand how magical that contraption is between your legs? Men start wars over pussy. We at war right now in the Middle East. It ain't got shit to do with terrorism. It's about oil, and oil is money. And if you got some money, you get some pussy. It's about pussy. Ladies, you don't give yourselves enough credit. Next time you get out the shower, and you butt naked and wet, take a second. Look at yourself in the mirror and high five your pussy. Bow! Salute yourself, you're worth it. I wish I could randomly go around high fiving pussies. I wish I could do it. "Excuse me, miss, you know what time it is?" "3:30." "Thank you, bitch." Bow! Even the fact that I mentioned the word "pussy," I look in the room and I see some of you ladies looking at me, drawing back, like... Stop it, this is for you. I'm trying to tell you, we don't celebrate women's bodies enough. Ladies, y'all need to stop getting caught up in some of these women's magazines. They're paying attention to some of these anorexic-ass actresses fucking with your head trying to define for you what beauty is supposed to be. 'Cause I got news for you. As me, we don't give a fuck... about what you give a fuck about. The minute you get butt naked, you've won. You got us. You think we really give a fuck about some love handles? Our standards are not that high. We fuck you from the back, you got love handles, we're like children. We act like we driving a car. Honk on your buttcheeks, bitch. Beep, beep, move. We don't give a fuck. I love pussy, goddamn it. I be glad when they put that shit in a toothpaste. Jesus Christ. I be at CVS for 47 tubes of pussy paste. I brush my teeth four times a day, I wouldn't even rinse. Just suck it dry. It's a beautiful word, "pussy." Isn't it? Like, if a woman came up to me and said, "Sir, eat my pussy." Absolutely. If a woman said, "Eat my vagina,"! Sound too much like vegetables. And who likes to eat their vegetables? It's a beautiful "P" edible word goes together with other beautiful "P" edible words, like pizza, pasta, pudding, pussy. It fits. Same thing with us, ladies, but in reverse. If your man came home and said, "Suck my penis," you wouldn't respect that. It's too fluffy, it's too playful. Popcorn, pretzels, pe... Fellas, you gotta say "dick." There's authority in it. Dick, death, danger, destruction, damage. Like, "Girl, open up your mouth. Put this death inside." And I'm a big fan of eating pussy, too. I used to not like it when I was younger. I wasn't ready, I was too immature. I was still a hamburger, hot dog and grilled cheese kinda guy. Can't expect a seven-year-old to embrace soft-shelled crab. They're not ready. I had to wait till my palate caught up with my maturity. And I take the shit serious now when I do it. I don't fuck around. I treat it special like the moment that it is. I get dressed for the occasion. Put on a tuxedo. I take a turkey platter and put it underneath her ass while she laying in the bed. 'Cause it ain't just about the meal, it's about the presentation. And ladies, as a personal favor to me, stop trimming and shaving your pussy hairs. Some of y'all get these little lines and landing strips. Some of y'all are smooth and as bald as a baby's ass. Knock it off. I'm a throwback nigga. I like a '70s bush. I wanna go down on a woman with so much hair, when I put my face down there, I look like a terrorist. I want you to see me looking at you. Like a puma in the jungle. Fellas, you gotta make that noise when you eat the pussy. That let her know you serious. She'll be like, "Thundercats, ho!" Listen, ladies, don't always go for the man that want you when you perfect. Go for the man that wants you when you flawed. 'Cause that means he really like you. Stick around past the bullshit, I'm the same way when it come to the pussy game. I'm a nasty motherfucker. I'm a freak. I don't get turned on by typical woman shit. That don't do nothing for me. I don't want a woman fresh out the shower, which your little smell goods and your scented creams and lotions. Fuck that. I want a bitch raw, in her natural state. I want you fresh out the gym when it's been cooking in its own sauces. I want you to come home and throw it on me. Like, "Baby, check it out." Thwap! Salty pussy juice! Tastes just like sea salt and vinegar potato chips. Ladies, we're nasty like that. You could do that to us. Fellas, we can't do that to them. Can't come home, be like, "Hey, baby. I've been playing basketball for six hours. Check it out, ball spackle." Thwack. Or use it as a chloroform. "Come here, bitch." All right, I know this is coming off kinda nasty. But there is a moral to the story. All I'm trying to say is, ladies, do not underestimate the value of your bodies. I know a lot of y'all want me to respect you for what's up here and what's in here. And this is gonna sound very misogynistic, but it's the realest shit I could ever tell you. Your power's not up here or in here. This is how powerful pussy really is. No woman in this country should ever be broke. Look, yeah. That's the honesty. Some of y'all don't even know how to respond to that. "I ain't no fucking ho." You're looking at the glass half full. Trying to point out your advantage. As long as you got titties, ass, and pussy, there is a man out there somewhere that'll fund your way through life. Every woman in here is sitting on a scholarship. Ladies, get your... 'Cause that's a hell of a hustle y'all got. Really, it is. Y'all can suck the right dick and be taken care of for life. Ain't a man in here that don't wish he could lick the right tit and be all right. And they had TV shows dedicated to y'all's hustle. What was that one show on VH1 about the basketball ladies? What they call that? Lucky Bitches, yeah. I would have loved for them to have said that one time in the name of honesty. "Next week on Lucky Bitches..." And I'm not just shooting shit to the breeze. I'm talking from experience, 'cause I recently went through a divorce. And ladies, let me let you know, between that child support and that alimony, that shit is unfairly and unjustly set up for y'all to win. That's y'all's hustle. 'Cause a judge ordered me to pay my baby mama 30 grand a month. Now, here's what was crazy about that. We knew for a fact that $5,000 took care of everything. My son's necessities, all the bills and the whatnots. They gave her the other 25 simply because it was available. You pay based on what you make as opposed to what's necessary. P. Diddy got two baby mamas. He pay 'em both 90 grand a month apiece. Fellas, did you know when you get a divorce, you are legally and financially responsible for her attorney's fees and yours? She don't pay a dime. And a divorce can take anywhere I was a year and a half in, and I was 175K in lawyer fees. The meter was still running. So, ladies, when you think that men don't wanna get married 'cause we're afraid of commitment... We're afraid of divorce. Divorce for a man is like getting raped in the police station while the cops watch and don't help. And when a judge tell you 30 grand a month, shit you can do about it but bend over and bite down on that rag. Well, actually, fellas, I take that back. There is something you can do about it. But if you gonna go there, you better make sure you and your best friend's stories match. Judge told me 30 grand. I said, "Shit. I'm gonna kill this bitch. First 48, here I come, goddamn it." Like, ladies, understand what I'm saying. If you get with a man from ground zero, and you build wealth together, success, pain, tears, struggle, together, well, then you deserve half. But some of these women get with these men, they got more than one comma on their paycheck, and I'm old-school. Fellas, if you got that kinda paper, and you got a good woman in your corner, ride or die soldier, when you leave your house in the morning to face life and life whoop your ass, you come home and she rub your back, make you a hot plate and make you feel relevant again, you supposed to make sure your woman look good from scalp to cuticle. But ladies, don't get cocky along the way. 'Cause I watch some of these shows like Real Housewives, and these chicks act like they had something to do with it. First of all, these dudes were already rich before they met you. They're rich. They chose you. They're rich, they have options. So if a man change your life and take you from fishsticks to lobster, that's wonderful. But never forget, bitch, you used to eat fishsticks. That's why it kill me, ladies, when some of y'all try to claim equality to a certain degree. It's not real. It's not honest. A woman should get paid the same amount of money for doing the same job as a man. Absolutely. But ladies, be easy with that equality shit. 'Cause y'all like to manipulate that when it suits you. If you my girl and you scream "equality," I need you mean that. Otherwise, I'm gonna put you to the test. If we asleep at night and somebody break in the house at four in the morning, don't look at me. I'm gonna turn right back to you and go, "You better get your equal ass up and handle this. This is the shit you been waiting on your whole life. Show me, bitch, show me!" You downstairs in the kitchen tussling. I'm in the bed with the sheets to my neck. "I hope she handle that ass-whooping as equally as I would." Ladies, don't let that feminine shit get to your head. A relationship is like a team sport. I play my part, you play yours. Let's get this goddamn trophy together. Stop trying to be and say and do too much. It's unnecessary. Ladies, y'all don't ever have to fight for dick, ever. Dick to a woman is like faucet water. It's free. Ladies, you wanna fuck a man, head up, go out on a date with him for the first time. And at the end of the night, be like, "Give me the dick." He ain't gonna be like, "No, no. I just met you. I can't." You say, "Give me the dick," he turn into a babbling idiot. "Give me the dick." "Come on, don't play now. Shit." 'Cause there's no value in dick. None. Dick is worthless. I could prove it to you right now. Every woman in this room could run out of here right now and run in the middle of traffic and flash your tits. And if a cop see you, the most you gonna get is a warning. "Miss, for godssakes... you're in a public place. Put your top down. Move along. Psst!" Let every man run out of here with his dick out. Nigga, we are all going to jail. And just to make us feel stupid, we be sitting the back of the paddy wagon handcuffed going to jail with your dick still out. 'Cause you know the cop ain't gonna put it back. "Sir, you wanna put your dick away?" "I will not." "Squad to base. We got a dude coming in with a dick out, be advised." They say it's harder for a woman to be a woman in life than it is for a man to be a man in life. I would agree with that in most cases, except relationships. Ladies, you have no idea how much pressure you put on us as men to please you. It's not a whole lot of pressure to please us. All you gotta do is yank it a couple of times, make us an egg sandwich with cheese, and leave us the fuck alone. We gotta please y'all on levels. We gotta please y'all mentally, emotionally, sexually, financially, romantically. Sometimes, a man don't always be up to task. It's a goddamn recession. Shit is hard out here. I'm gonna be honest. How many men like me ever suffered from premature ejaculation? That's fucked up. Y'all just gonna leave me out there like that? Goddamn, fellas, man down, nigga. Man down. All the men just looked at me like, "Nigga, that shit is personal as a motherfucker." So I'm the only dude in the room who dick ever took off before the starter pistol? And you ladies be devastated when it happens. "You... You came?" Like, bitch, I'm upset too. I didn't want this. I didn't want this! That's a testament to how good it really is. Like, fellas, you ever have your girl ride you, and she's working the shit out of you, and you feel yourself ready to come, but you know it's way too soon? You will grab her for dear life. Like, "Bitch! Don't you motherfucking move. Stop talking! Don't breathe! Don't think! Stop thinking!" I'll show you how fucked up you women are. Y'all acting like y'all didn't hear us. "What you want me not to do?" You come a little bit, game over. Now you gotta finish fucking with less ambition and a half chub. 'Cause every man in here knows there's nothing worse than fucking with a half-hard dick. That is the worst. You gotta squeeze the balls to keep all the pressure up front. You turn into a little kid, "Can I stop?" "No!" 'Cause the minute your dick go limp, that's when you hear the Pac-Man music when the ghost get him. And ladies, if your man is having dick issues, please be sensitive. Y'all can be some cold motherfuckers. There is nothing more emasculating to a man than having an opportunity to get some pussy and his dick is on vacation. 'Cause if our shit don't work, that's a wrap on the evening. Ladies, y'all don't have that problem. Your shit don't work, all y'all gotta do so go... and you back in business. Meanwhile, your man in the corner of the room, jacking off like a little troll under a bridge. And you fucking with him. "What's wrong? Ghost get you?" Like, why would you do that? That's mean. Why would you do that? And white women, y'all can be a little bit more sympathetic. Your man shit don't work, you're, "There, there." Black women kill your self-esteem. Our shit don't work, we in the bed jacking off, aggressive as shit, she right next to you with the remote." Shit. Die Hard fitting to come on." I'm saying, fellas, can't always be honest with your woman in bed. Sometimes, you be fucking your girl, and you feel yourself getting ready to come, and you announce that shit. Don't announce it, just do it. 'Cause when you announce it, that's when it backfire on you. "Babe... I'm about to... I'm about to come." You know what she gonna say. "Don't come yet." Ladies, do you know how hard it is for a man to stop an oncoming nut? It take every muscle in a nigga body to seize up at once... We got to pull from our toes all the way up. From the side, we look like a question mark. A man will go into cardiac arrest behind that shit. All of a sudden, sex turn into a crime scene. Detectives show up. "Hey, what do we got?" "Dude tried to stop a nut." "Does he have any ID?" "Yep, shit say Cadillac Black." You thought I forgot you, nigga? Look at Cadillac. He like, Go on." I'm just saying, fellas, don't let your ego get in the way. Like on a night like tonight, I know a lot of you fellas are here with your ladies. And you had a plan when you left the house. Go to a show, have some drinks, smoke a little herb, go back to the crib, I'm gonna obliterate the pussy. Yay! Somewhere along the night, your plan got fucked up. Maybe you drank a little too much, too full, put the wrong substance in your body. Now you don't have a full fucking tank. So if you're gonna come fast, you gotta be very careful what position you fuck in. You don't wanna be fucking missionary and come too fast. 'Cause there is nothing more that makes you feel like less of a man than you got come to fast and now you got to look her... in the face. And she hit you with that look like... And you hit her with that same look. "" That's why if you're gonna come fast, you gotta do it doggy style. That way you just pull out, splash on her ass, and run out the room. Don't say shit. As soon as it happens, you... Send her a postcard. Let her know you be home in two weeks. Any young couples in here, early 20s? Early 20s? Guys and girls? How old are you, baby? Twenty-three? Wow. You know how blessed you are? Like, I'm 41. Not like that's old. But it ain't 23. Like, your body is still... That's your dude right there? How old are you, bro? Twenty-two. Wow. Two young twenties, wow. I would love to be in the room when y'all fuck. I bet you when y'all fuck, it smell like citrus. Like Cinnamon Toast Crunch milk. And uncooked Cinnabon bread. Seem like an older couple right here. How you doing, dog? How old are you, bro? Fifty-one. Beautiful lady. How old are you? Fifty-three, 51, 53. See the difference, twenties? I bet you when they fuck, Yeah, you walk in their house, you be like, "Damn, somebody steaming cabbage? It smell like steamed cabbage in here." What's your name, young lady? What's your name? What is it? Kaleisha? God, sound like a STD. "Mom, my pussy itches." "Bitch, you got Kaleisha." And... what's your man's name? - Chris. - Chris. You know it's 2016, nigga. Why do you have a flat top? That nigga is rocking a 1998. This nigga got a haircut that brought a decade back. My man, I've been peeping you a little bit all night, my man right here. How old are you, bro? Twenty-one. Yeah, you look young. You look like you 12, nigga. Who you with? Who? That's your mom? Hey, Mom. Shit. This just got awkward. What's your name, dog? Rob? That's what's up. Rob, I know I've been talking a lot of sexual shit. It feel weird, me talking like that with your mom right there? A little bit? Don't let that fuck with you. 'Cause you know before you were born, your mother used to gargle your dad's nuts. You do know that. He had her in the room doing the Captain Morgan. And she was on her knees up under him, sounding like Schwarzenegger. "Get to the chopper, get down!" You gotta know that, son. Imagine that drive home. "Son, your daddy ain't never did the Captain Morgan. Don't believe what that nigga told you." You gonna walk past your parents' bedroom door now, you gonna hear all kids of shit. "Guys, we had a deal!" That's when your mother yell out, "Don't try to shallenge!" Kaleisha. Very pretty girl. Chris, compliments, man. Your girl is very gorgeous, man. You got a winner. Relax, nigga, I see the venom in your face right now. Nigga act like I'm trying to get the pussy. He holding onto her like she a limited edition. "There's only six of you left, bitch. Don't you..." Very pretty girl. You guys live together? No? Who you live with, Kaleisha? Y'all act like I'm gonna be at the bitch house, like, "Hey." Who you live with, sweetie? You're in school? Okay, what you trying to do? You in medical school? That's what's up. Stop clapping so aggressively. She might just be the bitch who put the pills in the jar. God. Well, you a very gorgeous girl. I wish I was your neighbor. I would knock on your door at 3:00 in the morning, asking for all kinds of unrealistic shit. Just hoping I could get a glimpse of you in something naughty. And when you answer the door, I'll be jacking off, no doubt about it. "Hey, you got some tires? You ain't got no tires? That's when Cadillac jump out the other bush. "Ask the bitch if she got sunflower seeds!" Philly, thank you for the love, man.
