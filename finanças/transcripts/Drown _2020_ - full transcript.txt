I begged Parvaneh Not to stay here Get away from Hashem She hadn't done anything wrong to runaway I said Don't work in the pool She didn't listen Why did they have to video her? Parvaneh it wasn't some miserable soul We did this to her When she married that piece of sh** Everyone knows Hashem loved Parvaneh He lost it Don't tell me this Tell your brother Who turned him into an alcoholic Made a thug out of him Shut your mouth Whenever you're stuck You just whinge I couldn't handle him They’re living their lives What about Hashem? - Take a seat He loved it when people were scared of him We need a lawyer We can without a baby I will get the money - How? My surgery is in a month What should I do? Forget about my brother So I can have a baby? They will give him a lawyer They won't be as good You could have told me when taking the money I have now Hashem has his own money Why would you say that? How could I ask him? With everything he did for us I was in prison for five years He saved us Now it's time to do the same Hashem being free Brings Parvaneh back? Hojat Look at me Thanks It's good thanks Mr Faramarzi You said Hashem’s medical records would prove his insanity The report from the coroners The crime scene investigation Says he was angry He was mentally stable I don't know what to do I got the evidence for his exemption from the service And witnesses I don't know why it didn't effect the order - What now?

Did our reputation come back Did we find the perpetrator? You said she is like your daughter Your sister If this had happened for your sister Wouldn't you look for who had done it? You didn't Because you didn't care Forget it Our brother is in prison Parvaneh is dead We will keep it quiet So it doesn't get worse It's not true Ahmad Why didn't you go after him?

I lied I knew he was from Arak It was in the details He could have lied Let's get going Don't do this to yourself How is finding him helpful to Parvaneh? Parvaneh wanted this Well done I swear I don't know who did this to me I've never heard this name I'm desperate I'm trying to say who did this to me Maybe he had a relative Do you have any enemies? If I have fights they're not like this The case is closed there and then People like you stand up for themselves You have to look for someone who isn't as strong I'm sick of myself Parvaneh paid for my mistakes Let me die This wild animal is called Hashem He eats humans Where did those days go? I'm not dead Think of whoever you're a little suspicious of I know Ahmad Very well He is a man of his words He will forgive if he's found But I don't want you to do this I'm standing by you We will find him Mosayeb is around Not him he's out on bail because of the swimming pool He's an airhead like me They will hide away from him You have to go on your own If you get stuck I can get him to help Do it on your own Okay whatever you say Tell me where to start Hi How are you? Hi Salma - How’s Hashem? Thank you Is Ashkan here? Hi You have quite a business here It's because of the prayers It's all what god wants Hojat hi Where have you been? I've come to say hi Welcome I hope it gets back Or else you couldn't have all of this He will get out no doubt - How are you so sure? I feel it He is coming out Really? When? - Is that bad? Why would it be? Did they consent? They will Is there something wrong? This is all a cover Where is the real job? This is all there is There's more - No Hashem said you bring the bottles from Baneh I get a few bottles and sell it for more He said to take me to Baneh You really thought I would believe your mom is selling pickles And you're minding the jars? No one knows I have my own production They think I bring bottles from Baneh Hashem found out in prison Where is Baneh? Marivan then Saghez and Baneh Thank you This way Thank you Sarvar Move Hi -Hello Is this the real thing? Get to work Alcohol and water Paint and pills Hashem said it would be cheap alcohol You would make 200 on each It wasn't enough for you So mixed it with water Made in Ashkan Khoroos Right Meysam This was Hashem’s idea Said who to get the bottles from He found you there buyers from uptown Right? Yes It isn't Or you would be one of his people Not to use women as your cover And have this business at this age. Right? Hashem is the king We will all work for him when he gets out You're nothing Who are you? You're a loser A nobody You could make enough for one With cheap material I'm old enough Hashem has always been nice to the neighbours He told me how to do it Otherwise I'd be making meth You were greedy You tried to ruin his life You sent people to video his wife So you can work for yourself right? No. I would never do that to him Why would I do something like that? Hashem was supporting the work He knew it inside out He'd the first investment Why would I try to do this to him? Then get into an accident to claim insurance for money Look at my leg Hojat, if I had done something like this I would move out of this area at least Why didn't you? Because it wasn't me I swear What's wrong? Get out Get lost Out Hashem didn't do anything to me For me to want to get him back like this If he said he’s suspicious of me You're here to ask me Tell him I said thanks You’re killing me I only mix alcohol and water I don't sell it to neighbours here Pray to god you're right I'm nothing Hashem won't let you breathe You know him I would never do something like that Same with you Hojat He's like a brother to me 2 million You will lose Hojat Shapoor Hojat is playing too? What brought you here? Bad luck Gholam what did you do for your arm? Were you compensated? I wasn't expecting it You seem to be winning today Not bad thank god Shapoor Could you thank god for gambling? Why not? Everyone makes a living So you should be quite religious to make so much Come here Move Yes Why do you want him to lose? I put in 2 million Why? He’s playing a good game You made so much with Hashem What's the problem? Shapoor did them 2 pay? They did I swear since he was arrested I've lost money What's wrong with you? - I'm playing on his name I don't make as much anymore Only losers come to play For little money It's not like the olden days Why? - I don't know They're worried about losing Don't be fooled by how calm they are now There's trouble So when Hashem was around it was brill - Of course So many people came for him Not like now You didn't pay him the last four months Just get to the point Say I'm here from my brother’s money I am I swear I told him I don't have it You were hurt when he destroyed the place Yes But he was drunk So I didn't think much of it Do you have women around? Do I look like I own a brothel? You think I sent someone for his wife? I swear I understand this sort of thing I made myself look like this for safety I thought you were the same as your husband Watch it Your uncle was the worst Parviz Kafar Not dead my husband Why do you ask me questions? I've done nothing wrong to be afraid Your brother was always good to me Okay Hojat I swear I don't know who did it But don't let them live That's what I'll do Are you staying the night?

Have some respect He doesn't know what it is The police rounded everybody up Hojat get out Mosayeb where the hell are you? Where's the key dad? I can't stand here What would you do? It's a scene We can't stand around Mosayeb said not to go alone Why did you do this if you can't stand up to them? What have you done where did you go? This is how I find out - I swear I didn't Go away You're just like Hashem I had no idea I don't know them why would I sell them out? Why don't you let him talk to them? They have a problem with him You talk to them - Me? They will kill me I can't stand here Get back You're getting on my nerves - Are you deaf? They’re ruining our reputation There's nothing you can do Enough Do you want to ruin our lives again? Afsaneh don't get on my nerves Sit down Calm down she's gone What should we do? - I'm not going to kill him He does He's not here to talk Why do you ruin her life? Why did you ask him to get involved? Who? What has he done wrong? It's them Thanks to Hashem we've seen enough of this It's not new Ignore them and they will leave There God Mohamad come B** I got them Take it Here Thank you - Sure It's okay Do you need anything?

Your friend who's like a brother Just so you wouldn't get ahead Would send people To do things to you in a garden You'd find out after three years The same friend who saved you when you're naked and abandoned Said this is a secret between us He did all of this To prove if you don't work for him He would do this too again You're telling lies To get away You were like his brother Why would he do that?
