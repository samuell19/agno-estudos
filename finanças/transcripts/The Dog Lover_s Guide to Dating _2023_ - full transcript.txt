Bon appetite, Radar. Radar, come. Here. Sit. Good girl. There you go. Morning. Oh, did you have your usual full continental breakfast this morning? And what are we treating ourself to today, Alex? All the nutrition I need right here in this efficient packaging. As they say, efficiency is the spice of life. Mm-hm. You know she takes way better care of you than herself, right, Radar? Oh, how I cherish these morning walks with my little sister. So, what's on the agenda for today? Well, I don't keep my schedule as color-coded as yours, but it's such a beautiful day. I think I'm going to teach my yoga class in the park. Will you please finally come to one? I will soon, I promise. I have to finalize my training schedule with the shelter dogs so that the difficult ones could be family ready and adopted sooner. So, more dogs. Yes, more dogs. It's my career, Sarah. And your spare time. All that volunteering, it's noble, but it's a lot. What's wrong with me spending all my time with dogs? They're sweet and they love you unconditionally. They're adorable, but do you really want a life partner who drools? Fine by me as long as they're reliable. Come on, Alex. What? You know that I'm right. People love talking about being there for each other, then they bail. Dogs? They would never. It's kind of hard to bail when you're on a leash. Kidding, Radar. We know that you're loyal. Seriously, though. There's all kinds of men out there. Like Jeremy? Exactly. Like Jeremy. I think I'm going to try cooking him veggie rolls again tonight. I still can't believe he agrees to try your cooking. I'm a terrible cook who loves to cook, and he loves me for it. Well, I may not be looking for a human life partner, but that doesn't mean I can't see that he's a good one. - Man: Simon, stop! - Ooh. Hey! Simon! Simon. Simon! - Woman: Hey! - I'm sorry! Simon! Sorry about that. No, no, no, no, no! Simon, come on! Everyone is watching us. What are you doing? Stop! Gotcha! Hold this. Stop it. Sit! Thanks. Kinda got away from me there. Yeah, I'm happy to help, but, you know, it's important to show your dog some boundaries. Oh, he's not mine. No. Simon belongs to a, uh, friend. Well, it's nice to meet you, Simon. And it's nice to meet you. Simon. Unfortunate coincidence. At least you weren't the one to name him, I guess. I think he actually enjoys the humiliation I feel when I have to say, "Simon, sit." Well, maybe try, "Simon says sit." But jokes aside, dogs don't really have that mean streak in them, only people do. Are you some kind of expert? My name is Alex. I'm a dog trainer. I see dogs like Simon in this park all the time, and my expert opinion is you can't be in your head around dogs. They like to be around people they can trust and people who trust in themselves. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again for the help. Bye, Simons. Ugh, I had to take that call. The buyers in Milan want to know if the fabrics from my capsule collection were sustainable. Imagine they weren't. That'd be crazy. Oh, he's so calm. He never likes people right away. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get to date. He's such a little gatekeeper. You know, I always say, you can't be in your own head around dogs. They trust you if you trust yourself. Wow. I love that. Here he is. Yes. Okay, gotta go. My little gatekeeper needs me. Man: There he is. Ah. Thanks, man, but I already grabbed one on the way. Don't tell me you were trying again with Chloe. I'm never trying. Right, right. So, rearranging your whole day just to bump into her and hold her dog while she gets a matcha latte? Yeah, not trying. Okay, it's not my whole day, and besides, you know, matcha latte isn't that bad once you get past the whole dirt aftertaste. Dude! I get that she's successful and beautiful, but I haven't seen you this stressed out since you couldn't get your hands on that Piaget watch you wanted so badly. That was a collector's item. So, is that what this is? What, just another beautiful thing to add to your collection? Okay, give me a little bit of credit here. Alright? Chloe, yes, is very beautiful, but she's also smart and cultured... And very beautiful. Mm-hm. And for the record, I'm not losing with her. I'm losing with her dog. This thing has no chill. I mean, it goes crazy every time I try and talk to her. You don't need dating advice, you need dog training advice. That's actually not a bad idea. I'm going to take this after all. Hey! What do you mean actually? Don't worry. I'll be back for the pitch meeting. I know just where to go. Oh. Excuse me! Uh, excuse me. Hello? Hi. Excuse me. Oh! I am so sorry. What are you doing? I'm just trying to get your attention. Sorry. Wait, you again? Do you just go around trying to scare people's dogs? Look, the reason that I followed you home... Wait, no, I didn't follow you home. I, uh, went to the dog park, asked about you, which I thought was a long-shot, but turns out you're the Beyonc√© of dog-owners. Anyway, I wanted to thank you again for everything you did yesterday, and... Wow, I had no idea someone with such short legs could walk so fast. Are you serious? The dog. I meant the dog. It's important to set the pace with the dog so they know who's in command of the situation. Right. You said, "and?" Yes, I need professional help. Well, that we can both agree on. With a dog. You said that wasn't your dog. It's not, but I might want it to be. So, you want help stealing a dog? I mean, what is wrong with you? What? No! I... Okay. Let me explain. I want your help to win over a dog, so I can win over its owner. I am a dog trainer, and a good one at that. I do not train people, and I certainly don't get mixed up in people's dating schemes. I just need a dog trainer. The dog eases up, I got a shot with her. Name your price. It's a win-win-win. That's not how this works. You can't fake it with a dog. You really have to show up. Show me how to show up. Look, as I said, I am a dog trainer. If you're looking to meet someone, why don't you go swipe left or right or up or whatever people do. Swipe up? What kind of apps are you using? Help me and, um... What is that? I will help you make flyers that don't make people want to throw them in a shredder. I'm an advertiser. It's what I do. Just think about it? Think about it! Hey. Oh, my gosh. Are you finally joining my yoga class? Are you actually doing something for your own well-being, Alex? Still booked solid, but I thought I'd come say hi to my little sister before my next client. Okay, well, if you don't have time to salute the sun, then please take the time to eat something other than a power bar. Alex: Hi, Gabe. How are you? Gabe: Good, what can I get you? The usual. Oh, I nearly forgot. Alex: What's all this? "This should help with the stain and here's that coffee I owe you. Text me if you're game to help this old dog learn some new tricks." Thanks, Gabe. Am I, I don't know, missing something? Remember that guy that couldn't handle that anxious dog that destroyed everyone's picnic? He tracked me down and he wants me to help him. So, why do you have that look on your face? I mean, it sounds like he desperately needs it. No, it's that he's trying to use this poor little dog. Either way, it sounds like the dog could fully use the training, and it's not like you to turn someone away when they need you. You need to turn that dog into date bait. Alright, well, I have to go. I will think about it, okay? Have a good class. Simon: Come on. Stop. Stop. Drop it! Stop it! Stop it! These are not for you! Chloe: Be careful, Simon. Let go, Simon. Whoa! Strong for a little guy. Come on. Okay, that's enough, precious. It's fine. Simon, stop. Oh, no. It's okay. He didn't bite me. No, I mean you. You're upsetting him. He's anxious enough around strangers. Come here, my baby. I just can't leave him like this. But I got us reservations for Carbone. And you will definitely love it. When I was still eating gluten, I died for the lobster ravioli. You understand that I can't leave him like this, right? Yeah, of course. I hope he's okay. I'm just going to... Yeah. Great, keep him close to you. Then come around. Yup. There you go. Sit. Can you sit? Good boy. Alright, that's it. You are a star student, and I have a reward for you for all your hard work. - Wow. - There you go. Thanks, Alex. Bye, Anne. We gotta stop meeting like this. Well, we could if you'd let me book a session. Your dog park is just around the corner from Chloe's. Wow. - Mm-hm. - That bad, huh? Worse, actually. Well, that's pretty standard behavior for stressed out dogs. Let me guess, you brought her flowers, but you didn't bring the dog anything. What, am I supposed to bring the dog flowers, too? Come on. What? Okay, listen. This isn't about you, and there's no quick fix, but dogs need consistency, they need to trust you. So, bring a treat every time you see him, and he'll start to associate you with good things. Did we just have our first session? I was helping out a dog in distress. Fine, you know dogs, but I know people. And? And someone who had no intention of taking me up on my offer wouldn't still have that note in her pocket. Wh... Come on. Settles that. It's too late. See, advertising 101, I won the second I got your attention. So, that's advertising? Everything's advertising. And just like when I'm in a pitch meeting, I'm not going to wrap until I get a yes. You didn't get a yes. Didn't I? I'll see you Saturday for our first session. And don't worry, I won't be late. Hey, well, maybe our first lesson should be in listening! Ready for your first lesson? We agreed I'm hiring you as a dog trainer, not a personal trainer, right? Okay, I barely agreed to this, and you don't need a personal trainer so much as you need a life coach, but we'll just breeze right past that. This is a lesson for you and the dog. I thought we would start far away from patio furniture and restaurant patrons, because I think you have a shy dog on your hands. Did you see what he did to the picnickers? I know, Simon was very badly behaved. It's too easy. Look, I know he seems unruly, but I think he's just overwhelmed. Chloe does tend to take him to busy, trendy places. Right, and 15% of dogs are shy, and, like people, they need to be eased into unfamiliar situations and slowly get to know new faces. But here, it's perfect. There aren't any people and he can expend any pent up nervous energy. Okay, great. So, the lesson is take the dog outside. Back up. The lesson is get comfortable yourself, then you can take the dog outside. I'm not shy. That is clear. Thanks? It's not about you being shy. Dogs can sense when something off. So, if you're nervous or if you're giving off, uh, some kind of try-hard vibe... So, your expert opinion is the dog doesn't like my vibes? I give off great vibes. It's why I have all the top clients in my firm. Mm-hm. Uh-huh. How do I fix my vibe? Get comfortable with yourself and the dog. That shouldn't be too hard. So, take Radar here. She's sweet, non-judgmental, fun. You can be yourself, and she'll love you for it. Just be myself. Yes, while petting Radar. Alright. Hey, girl. Yeah. You're a sweet girl. Here, why don't you take the leash? Alright. Out here you don't have to worry what people think of you. I don't care what other people think of me. You definitely do. Isn't it your job to know exactly what people are thinking? Yeah, I guess. And meant to give them exactly what they want? Yeah, but don't you do the same thing with dogs? Not at all. I care about what dogs are feeling. I give them what they need, not what they want. It's a partnership. Partnership. Hi. Hey. I won't keep you. I just wanted to check in to see how you were doing today. Oh well, I've been running all over town, but I'm good. Good. Ha. Um... Listen, I know you have a lot on your mind, but I also know that you never forget that today is Dad's birthday, and you also don't like to admit that it's a really hard day for you. Maybe that's because he doesn't deserve our attention or our tears. Sarah: I'm not asking you to cry, Alex, but I also don't think that we need to pretend that he didn't walk out on us or that we weren't hurt by him. It just feels like there's always something there to remind us. Whether it's his birthday, the day he left, Christmas. Maybe I just need to pretend that I'm okay, even if I'm not. But I know that it's hard on you, too. You were barely three years old. But you grew up to be amazing, and that's why I don't need anyone else but you and Radar. I'm not going to ruin this moment by telling you that that is incredibly cheesy. Love you. Love you, too. I'm not, like, outdoorsy, but this is actually really pretty. Are we going to one of those super secret VIP concerts? My friends were invited to a party by this remote waterfall. It turned out to be the most exclusive Rhianna concert. Uh, no, this isn't one of those. Oh. Is this, like, research for a client or something? No, um... What, so, are you just, like, into nature? Yeah, I thought a calm place like this would be perfect for Simon, you know? There's not a lot of people, and he can expend any nervous energy he has. I'm so sorry. This... This was a lame idea. You deserve a VIP concert. This isn't lame at all. I love that you thought of him. Most guys I date just kinda brush him off, you know? You included him. It's really thoughtful. Well, I think under all the bravado he's a big softie. And which Simon are we talking about here? See? He's warming up to you. Are there black flies out here? I don't know. Maybe. Why? I'm allergic to their bites. And while I love how much he's loving this, I'm worried I might need an Epipen or twist an ankle, or both. Ow. Yeah, they're... Ow! You know what? This whole date has gone from lame to dangerous. Come on, let's get out of here. Alex: Come on, Simon. Simon: Run, Simon! Wow, and you printed them all off, too? All printed and ready to post. Thank you so much. Do you think this will help Rusty find a good home? Course it will. Who could say no to that face? Just be me in a forest. Excuse me, are you lost, sir? Very funny. Can I come up? Lesson one failed. Man, do I have a story for you. Can't wait to hear it. This should be a fun visit. Yeah, well, it's too bad I didn't have a couple gallons of bug spr... Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, Simon. Jacob. Jacob and I volunteer at a shelter together. He's the most dedicated one there. Oh, no. Alex, that would most definitely be you. She helps us train and rehabilitate the most troubled dogs so we can find them happy homes. These days it feels like I can't keep up. Capacity's a real problem, but you didn't come here to talk about all that. I'm assuming you're here to discuss a certain date? Oh, are you two dating? Both: No. His romantic issues are with a dog. Oh, sounds complicated. Yeah. I'll leave you to it, but I'll see you this week at the shelter? You bet. Thanks again. My pleasure. Nice meeting you. Yeah. So, should we be talking about my love life or, uh, yours? What? Jacob. That is someone to swipe up on. There will be no swiping. Come on. He's a handsome do-gooder who clearly likes you. Seems like a no-brainer to me. Back to you. So, lesson one was a failure? Yes, the secluded nature date was a complete bust. Well, I did suggest it as a dog training tactic, not a date, because again, I am not a dating expert. Clearly. That whole process is contrived anyway. So, dating's a bit of a sore spot for you? No, it's just not a part of my plan. Right, so you don't plan on dating, like, ever? I want to focus on work instead of trying to impress other people. I choose to spend my time with someone who loves me unconditionally, like Radar. Normal people date other people. No offense, Radar. Well, you are just full of insights this evening. I will take that under advisement, but right now I need to hang these flyers. Alright. I'll join you. What? Poor Rusty's gonna be homeless for the rest of his life. Why!? Okay, first of all, you gotta post these online, not on telephone poles. What year do you think it is? And second of all? "Older arthritic dog. Needs a home once his worms are fully treated. Home should be well-ventilated and requires large outdoor space. Do not adopt this dog if you aren't ready to put in the work. Way to sell the dream. People need to have a realistic view of dog ownership. So many dogs are abandoned at our shelter because they think owning a dog is just cuddles all the time. I get that, but this is, uh, a little bleak. Okay, well, what do you suggest? Well, tell me about Rusty. What's he like? Arthritis and worms aside. He's the sweetest dog. He's affectionate and smart, and he's great with kids. Alright, well, why don't we let Rusty shine a little bit, shall we? What if we said, "Looking for an affectionate, obedient dog who's great with kids?" Mm-hm. "Rusty needs a home and lots of love. House trained and ready to be cared for." I guess that is a bit better. Yeah, you can get your point across without the scary disclaimers. There are lots of people out there looking for dogs to love. I know that there are good dog owners out there. You know, the same could be said for someone looking for a relationship. That's a bridge too far. You know, for someone who loves dogs for their big-hearted sincerity, you're surprisingly cynical. I have my reasons. So, I guess you don't want to get into it right now? Alright, well, why don't we grab something to eat instead, 'cause I'm starving. I have dinner. What is that? It's a power bar. Saves me time. Yeah, it also saves on flavor. 7:00 o'clock. I know the perfect place. So, where are you taking me? Nowhere with a guest list I hope. Do you like sandwiches? Sandwiches? Mm-hm. You criticize my power bars, and you're taking me to get sandwiches? You know, I have peanut butter at home. Not just a sandwich. The sandwich. Right this way. Simon, where have you been? I was starting to think that you found a new sandwich guy. Diego, you know you're my one and only, man. Hey, yeah. We'll get two regulars. Yeah. You like spicy? Love it. Extra spicy. Perfect. Leave it to you to find the trendiest sandwich spot in town. Okay, you say the word "trendy" like it's a dirty word. It's for a reason. Diego bakes his own bread. He marinates the chicken overnight. He grills his own vegetables. - Wow. - Exactly. Here you go. Oh. Oh, you did it again. Thanks, man. Both: Wow. Every time it's a masterpiece. Careful, or you're going to give me one of those Gordon Ramsey egos. So, tell me, do I get the honor of meeting your special someone here? Um, no. She's not, um... She's my dog trainer. Your dog trainer? My, um... I'm training his girlfriend's dog. You brought your girlfriend's dog trainer out on a date here? She's not my girlfriend. Like, we've only been out a few times... And this is not a date. It's complicated. Anyway, Alex here has no time for food, and she's been eating nothing but protein bars. So, I had to bring her here so she could experience what she's been missing out on. Oh, Alex, you're breaking my heart. A delicious meal is one of life's greatest joys. Second to great love, and Mexico winning the World Cup. These require two hands, unlike your protein bars. Mm. Wow! What is this!? This is the regular, and you wouldn't be eating it if it wasn't for this guy. Diego. Careful, or you're going to make me sound like a good guy. Thanks. Wow. How is I that I have you to thank for this little piece of Heaven? Diego and I, uh, we go way back. And? I helped him with a bit of advertising, and we got one of the top food critics to come out and experience his amazing food, and, uh, the line-up's been crazy ever since. So, you use your power of persuasion for good, too. Alright, admit it. Human food is good. If you have the time, it's great. Alright, I'll take that as progress. So, when is the next lesson? Tomorrow. I am going to take you to the animal shelter. Alright, I have a pitch meeting in the morning, but, uh, I'll meet you right after. Great. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Alright, so what do the clients want for this rebrand? They're looking for sleek. Aspirational. Gwyneth meets Tesla, you know? For dog food? I know we got a lot of clients, but, uh, did we mix up the files? We are talking about Good N Happy Dog Food, right? We are. Look, I'm just reading from the brief they sent over. Cutting edge. Clean eating. Bio. Organic. Cleanse culture. Of course. They're just looking for the basic Goop aesthetic. Like every other client we have. Okay then. I think we should give them exactly what they want. I mean, we always do. Okay. I'll get some concepts sent over to them. Thanks, and once they approve those, I'll run point on the campaign shoot. Deal. Thanks. - Two coffees. - Oh, whoa. I'm taking your advice to always bring treats. Good boy, Simon. Hey, Jen. Need a hand? Oh. Thanks, Alex. I think I'm okay, actually. Jacob showed up early this morning to help me with the packing. Packing? The landlord called to tell us he's selling the building. We have to be out of here by the end of the month. But that would mean shutting down the shelter. You have to fight this. Alex, I've been fighting for months. It's a lost cause. Let us help you. I can't let you help anymore, Alex. Between running your business and volunteering here, I'm surprised you get any sleep. Why don't you buy the building? I would if I could. I guess I just don't have the means, uh... Simon. Your newest volunteer. Nice to meet you. Volunteer trainee. Forgive him. He's used to dealing with corporate clients that have tons of money to throw around. Well, I admire your ambition, Simon, but if you'll excuse me, I have to get more stuff from the back. So, you're volunteering here now, too? Yes. I, uh, guess I am. Alex: The end of the month? That doesn't give us enough time to find homes for these dogs. I know, Jen is devastated, but the landlord's just not budging on the timeline. I gotta run, but we're going to figure something out. What if we held a fundraiser to help Jen buy the building? Well, the building's expensive, and we only have a couple weeks. Yeah, but I could secure a location and sponsorship from my clients. We're leading the ad campaign for Good N Happy dog food. It's kind of perfect. I could invite my clients. They'd love a cause like this. Yeah, but it would have to be exclusive, right? We want people to pay top dollar to attend. Oh, we could hold a silent auction. Are you sure you want to do this? Well, what can I say? I'm feeling inspired. So, Ziggy is a rescue, and he might have been abused, so just be careful with how you approach him. Pet him like this and say his name gently. Alright. Hey, Ziggy. Hey. That's a good boy. I think he likes you. Must be my natural charisma. So, should I give him a treat, or? With dogs like Ziggy, we like them to do something in exchange for a treat, like shake a paw. Huh. How come? He didn't feel very secure with people when he first came in. So, he's more comfortable with a clear hierarchy and little jobs to do. Huh. So, he prefers structure and he has trust issues. Anyone here that could relate to that? Oh, well, that's pointed. Would you prefer an eager to please lovesick pup? Ouch. Tell him to sit, shake a paw, and then comes the treat. Okay. Ziggy. Sit. Paw. Good boy. - That was great. - There you go! Well, that was really cool, but I'm not sure it's going to impress Chloe. Right. Well, maybe the takeaway here is the give and take in a relationship. Uh, which relationship are you talking about? Okay, you're saying that I try too hard and there's no... What's the word you love to use? Both: Partnership. But hey, I'm a dog trainer, not a relationship expert. What do I know? I could show you how to get doggy Simon to bring her a flower, though. Yeah, I don't think she likes flowers. Okay, well, what does she like? Designer clothes. I don't think those belong in a dog's mouth. What else? Matcha lattes. A small token. Something thoughtful. Um... What do you guys talk about? Honestly, it's kind of hard to talk much with bad Simon around. There are no bad dogs, Simon. Only badly trained dogs. Let's go about this a different way. What do you like about her? Well, well. That's easy. She's super successful. She's, uh, cool. Beautiful, and, uh... Look, I just want a chance with her. Well, at least you're making progress with dogs. Do you feel like this look is good for the event? Hi! Sorry, we're running a little late. Addison is wearing my designs in Cannes this year. She had a last minute change of heart about a few of the designs. Simon. Sit. Good boy. We'll give you some privacy to try on the rest of the outfits. Let's go get you some coffee. Ever since I switched to an alkaline diet, I don't keep any in the house. You know, that drink order was really something. Well, why would I compromise when I know what I like? Wow, I guess the forest path wasn't a fluke after all. Simon's being such a good boy. Hm. I could get used to hearing that. Well, I don't have to worry about getting my steps in when I'm with you. Is that a bad thing? Just an observation. Oh, you've been observing me now? Yes. And? And... What have you observed? Well, um, you're very focused. Structured. I am. I get a lot done that way. You do. You get a lot done for other people and their dogs. So? So, if you're always focused on helping other people, how do you help yourself? Oh, come on, I had a full meal with you. Yeah, you really know how to treat yourself. Is this about me not dating again? Well, luckily, you don't need to worry about me. Besides, you have bigger things to focus on. I love this view. No. Whoa, whoa. Easy, Simon. I... I... I'm just... I'm just going to go back the way I came, alright? It's good to face your fears. Oh, yeah? And when's the last time you did that? Okay, we're done talking about me. We're here to help you. I don't know how this is going to help me or little Simon. Your palms are sweaty, right? And your heart is racing? Mm-hm. That's how a little dog feels when he's around the big threats of the world. - Okay. - So, I'm going to show you a little trick to help calm him down, okay? Okay. Imagine if this is a treat. Yeah, my imagination is not that good. Especially when I'm about to plunge to my death. Okay. When Simon gets upset like this, I want you to hold this treat up and I want you to look him in the eyes, and let Simon know that everything is going to be okay. Everything's going to be okay, Simon. Come on. Hey, don't look down. Don't look down. Look at me. There you go. Okay. Your heart's slowing down now, right? Yeah. I still don't know why you had to scare me half to death by bringing me up here, but... Honestly, I hadn't planned on it, but I figured why not be spontaneous? Break out of my rigid structure. It's beautiful, right? Wow. So, what do you think? Well, it's slick. It's pretty, uh... It's so boring. It looks just like the mock-ups, though, you know? I know, we always give the clients exactly what they want, but it's just... It's got no life, you know? We need something more interesting for the dog food display. So, what are you thinking? I know what we need. Or rather who we need. Sit. Yes. Uh-oh. Canine emergency? Let me guess. Christ Evans needs you to train his mother's bichon. Very funny. No, it's Simon asking if Radar and I can help him out on set for a commercial he's shooting. Actually, he says, "Need you." Do all of your handsome clients talk to you that way? He's only a client so I can help him win over some gorgeous model turned designer. I looked her up on TikTok, not my finest moment, okay? And yet he's texting you in his hour of need. Interesting. Stop, he said he needed a dog. Anyways, you better get going. I'll finish up here. Don't wanna keep Don Draper waiting. Go fetch her a human relationship. If I wanted a relationship, it wouldn't be with someone who isn't house-trained. Well, I can't speak for his training, but he seems like a man who knows how to ask for help, and that is more than most people I know. Come on, Ziggy. There you go. Come on, boys. Come on. Oh! Hey! You made it! Hey, guys. Hey, thanks for coming, huh? Oh, man. Do I owe you big time. Your tab's getting pretty big. Simon, you know, I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Ziggy's really uncomfortable in unfamiliar environments. Are you sure it's Ziggy you're talking about? Hey. It's going to be okay. An expert dog trainer who is going to save this shoot taught me that trick. And besides, these guys don't bite. At least not as much as your usual clients. Hey, everybody. This is Alex. Alex, meet everybody. Hi. - Hey. - Okay. Should we get started? Ziggy! Sit. Good boy. Down. Good boy. Okay, Radar. Roll over. Good girl! You know what? I have an idea. They say that I'd just call it quits They said I'd call it Whenever I would face a complication Simon: Smile for the camera, Ziggy! They underestimate my grit My hand is steady, yeah I'm never shaken See me dining at the Ritz All my girls and I 'Cause, baby, we earned it And we know we're worth it If you think that I'm a ditz You'll be thinking twice Yeah, nice! Look under the surface Ooh, baby, I'm certain Yes! Oh, baby, I'm certain Okay, that's a wrap everyone. Great job. - Yeah. - Thank you so much. Sorry.
