BASED ON A TRUE STORY "JARAN GOYANG" BECOMES INSANE THEN MADLY IN LOVE Tantri! Why are you here, Ki? It's been a long time since you bring offerings to my Memorial Structure! I no longer have use for this Jaran Goyang spell in my body. Now be gone! Whoever uses the Jaran Goyang spell, will suffer the consequences! I am giving back the Jaran Goyang spell to you. I have no use for it anymore. Come on. Why isn't his phone active yet? Sis, you have a show at Manado on Wednesday, okay? Tania, please don't take any job yet. I'm still going out of my mind here. I haven't heard anything from Robert. I kept calling him, but his phone is dead. Come on, Sis. Who cares? You are a famous singer, you know? Just find another guy. Simple as that. Tania, don't step on the brakes all of a sudden like that. Be more careful when driving. Sorry, Sis. I saw a horse ran really fast. A horse? What's wrong with this car? Let me check first. Tania? There was something wrong with the car, Sis. I'm not lying. The car couldn't move. Well, there's nothing wrong with it now, right? Alright, let's just get back in the car. Don't stay out here too long. Come on, let's go. A horse shoe? Does this shoe belong to the horse you saw before? That's impossible. - Let me see that. - No! Sis, why did you threw it away? Who cares? Just leave it there. Let's get back inside the car. Come on, Tania! Get back in the car! Tania! Sis.. Isn't this the horse shoe that you threw away before? That's right! How can it get in here? This is so weird! Come on, you should throw that away, Tania. No, I'm not going to do that! This is pretty nice. Look. It's got a unique shape and it's nice. Let me keep it. Who is it? Sis? Housekeeper? Elena! Sis! Elena! Sis! Sis! - Sis, open up! - What's wrong, Tania? Sis, I'm really scared. When I was downstairs, your picture suddenly fell! Alright, if you're scared, you can sleep in my room. Come on, now. You are such a pretty lady. If only you can become my lover. Dirga, stop having strange thoughts about Miss Elena. Who do you think you are? Just look in the mirror. Is it wrong for me to admire her beauty? Well, there's nothing wrong with that. But you can not force love. Let alone to ask a woman to love you. You would become crazy, stress, insane and have a mental illness. I'm serious. Move out of the way! Still not active. What's going on? Miss? Dirga? I made coffee for you. How dare you go in my room without my permission? I thought I would make this coffee for you. I know you like this coffee. Alright, I'll drink it! - It's really hot, Miss! - Elena! - Dirga? - It's really hot! Elena! Elena, you mustnâ€™t do that to him! But he has no manners! He went in my room without permission! He meant no harm and you should've told that to him nicely! I need a fresh air. My head is about to explode. Dirga? What do you want this time? I have something for you, Miss. Don't get too close! Please accept this. Okay, I'll accept it. But remember, do not get close to me or disturb me again! You freak! "I love you?" Damn you crazy gardener! I'm sorry, Mrs. Davina. I need to go to my hometown for family business. Sure, that's okay, Dirga. You may go. But please don't be too long and come back soon, okay? Alright, Ma'am. Excuse me. Alright. Have a safe trip. - Peace be upon you, Mrs. Serintil. - And upon you be peace. Azizah, I want to give these materials, so you can make a Kebaya for me. Sure, let me take those. I'll bring it home. Thank you. Alright then, I need to go inside. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you be peace. Auntie! Aunt Serintil! Stop! Auntie. I sense you have a bad intention coming here. Auntie. I am here to ask you a favour. Please give me the spell of affection. I don't have that spell. It's true that I master a couple of dances which makes people admire me. But I only do that just to conserve our culture. Auntie, please help me. I have been insulted and humiliated by a girl, Auntie! No, Dirga. That spell of affection will only bring you disaster. I promise you, there's only one girl who I admire. You should admire your mother who has given birth to you! Not some girl of your dreams! Yes, I know that. But as a normal guy... ...besides my mother, there's got to be another woman that I love. No, Dirga! I have already lost the person that I loved because of that spell. I don't want the same thing to happen to you. Alright. If you refuse to give me that spell... - ...it's better for me to die! - Dirga! - Stay away! - Dirga! - Stay away! - Don't be foolish! - I don't want to live anymore! - Dirga! Alright! I will give you the spell of affection! But there are a couple of things you need to do. Do you have the courage? Of course, Auntie. Tonight you must go to a grave located near this village. And you must take 7 Cyperus rotundus in the middle of that sacred grave. Help! Let me go! Here is that sacred grave! Excuse me. I will take the Cyperus rotundus. Please, have mercy! I just need a couple of them! Please forgive me! Hi, Sis! What is that? Whose ring is that? This ring is from Dirga. Dirga? Wow! I didn't expect that he can afford to buy you a nice and expensive ring like this. But the problem is, I have already thrown it away. And suddenly, it's back in this room and I found it on top of my table. I'll keep it. Who is it? Hello? Robert? Robert? Robert? Tania, what's the matter with you? Sis, I just saw Robert. That's impossible, Tania. If he is coming here, he'll inform me first. But that wasn't.. Hey, stop talking nonsense. Come on, let's go. Your tread isn't over yet. You must go to the Memorial Structure of Ki Blawong at Larang Mountain... ...and bring a couple of requirements from me. Remember, Dirga. This ritual is very dangerous. Why is there a coconut? But there is no tree.. You must bring a whip, Cyperus rotundus and offerings to Jaran Goyang Memorial Structure. This whip will hold a very powerful spell of affection. It will also protect you from ghost. Do you still have a hair sample of that woman? Yes, I do. I took Elena's hair sample that was stuck on her comb. Just plant that hair around the Memorial Structure. And then read this spell.

Elena, this is your mother! Housekeeper! Yes, what is it, Ma'am? Miss, snap out of it! Get a hold of yourself. - Miss, snap out of it. - Elena, this is your mother. - Calm down, Miss. - This is your mother, Elena. Come on, let's bring her upstairs. Come, honey. - Let's go, Miss. - Come. - Give me a hand. - Alright. Take it easy. Auntie. I did it. I have seen Blawong, that sacred horse. The girl who has been struck by the Jaran Goyang spell becomes insane... ...and will be madly in love with you. It will be hard to cure that. I'm sure right now her feelings has been influenced by the black horse spirit. You should marry that girl. Yes, Auntie. I will definitely marry Elena. There is one more thing you must do. In the night of the full moon... ...you must perform the Lengger and Kuda Kepang Dance. And you must be the dancer. I'm ready to that, Auntie. Thank you very much for all your help. - I will take my leave. - Hold on. Remember, Dirga. Don't ever use this Jaran Goyang spell to satisfy your egoistic lust. Yes, Auntie. I greet you farewell and will be off to Jakarta. - Thank you, Auntie. - Alright. I don't understand. Why is Elena very eager to see Dirga? Maybe she feels guilty for him. What? Dirga? Miss. Dirga! Where have you been all this time? I was waiting for you. Miss.. From now on, don't call me that again. Just call me Elena. Dirga, I really miss you. Hey! Elena! Dirga, what are you doing? How dare you do this to my daughter! Mom, don't be rude to him! From now on, you must leave this house and don't ever come back! Get out! - What did I do wrong? - Get out! No, Dirga. - No, don't go. - Elena, just let him go! - Elena! - Dirga! Elena, listen to me. Elena! Let me go! - Elena, listen to me! - Dirga! - Elena! - Don't leave me, Dirga! - Just listen to me, Elena! - Dirga! - Elena! - Dirga! - Elena? - Dirga! - Elena! - Dirga! Elena, this is your mother. Elena? - Tania. - Yes, Mom? Where is Elena? Why isn't she home yet? Maybe she's gone somewhere. I have a bad feeling that she's going to meet up with Dirga. Well, let's hope she's not. We can't stop her from going out. Because she's a singer. She has a busy schedule. I even have a hard time managing her schedule. Alright, please wait for your sister here. I need to go out and visit a friend of mine who is ill. Alright, honey? - Goodbye. - Bye, Mom. - Take care, Mom. - Alright, honey. - Dirga? - Hello, Miss. Dirga, I really want to see you. Right now I am at Cafe D'consulate. I'm on my way there right now. - Wait for me, okay? - Alright, Miss. Dirga. Dirga, sorry I'm late. That's okay, Miss. I really miss you. I also really want you to be my girlfriend. Do you want to come with me to my hometown? I will go wherever you go. Housekeeper? Auntie? Aunt Serintil? Yes? Hi! Auntie, let me introduce you. This is Elena, my girlfriend. You're so beautiful, Elena. But I feel as if I've known you for a long time. There is a yearning feeling. I am very happy to come to this village. I heard from Dirga that you are a dance teacher. I want to learn how to dance. Sure, I'll be glad to teach you. I'll teach you how to dance properly. Dirga, from now on you will be my manager, okay? What's the matter, honey? - There was somebody's head in front of me! - I don't see anything. But I really saw somebody's head. I'm not lying. I saw it. Hold on. Let me check. There's nothing here. Hey, who is that? Honey? - That's Robert's head! - Who is Robert? - The white guy! - What are you talking about? You know, Robert.. Just forget it! Come on, honey. Get inside. Come on, let's move! - Hurry up, honey. - Alright. Now I am giving this house to you! - For me, honey? - Yes. - This house? - Yeah. You have a lot of money, honey. Hey, honey. I'm not only giving you this house. But I am also giving you my car! But promise me, honey. Don't ever leave me. You have to take care of me forever. I promise. I will never leave you. Come here. The news about Elena hooking up with Dirga is already all over the social media. Oh my God. I'm also concerned about Elena. Why does she have such a bad taste? How can she fall in love with Dirga? Maybe to her, Dirga is a nice guy. But it's just weird that Elena is willing to be Dirga's girlfriend. I'm sure there's something odd about this. I'm sure Dirga has something that can influence her soul. Maybe Elena is under the influence of a spell. Elena. I need to talk to you. What do you want to talk about? I'm really tired. - I want to go to bed. - Elena, I want to ask you something. How can you be so in love with Dirga? The news is already viral in social media. Aren't you a shame and afraid that your career will be destroyed because of that news? Are you even aware about this? You sacrifice yourself just for a guy like Dirga? That's enough! I really don't care what people say! I am the one living this life, not them! Please, Mom. Don't get involved with my business. I only know that I love and care for him! And I don't give a damn what other people say! But what you're doing is odd and you are not acting normal! Mom, I feel pretty normal doing all of this! Because I care and I love him! - Elena, I haven't finished talking! - I'm tired, Mom! Who are you? You're a thief, aren't you? Tantri! What's the matter with you? Mother! I just saw a man. His face was all black! Tania.. You are also pretty. You also have to be my girlfriend. Hello, Tania? Dirga, I want to see you! Why are you calling me this late? I can't right now. How about tomorrow? No, I don't want that! I want to see you right now! Sorry, Tania. I'm really busy right now. I can't see you today. Let's meet up tomorrow, okay? Dirga! Tania.. You will also be my girlfriend. Honey, I'm going on a tour outside of town. You come with me, okay? You'll become my manager. Honey, I don't feel well. I have to rest. What a pity. It's not fun if you don't come. Alright, next time.. Next time I'll come with you. Alright, that's okay. By the way, honey. I have transferred 50 million to you, okay? What, honey? 50 million? - Thank you very much, honey. - You're welcome. Alright then. I'm going to leave now, okay? Take care, okay? Bye. Dirga, please be my boyfriend. I can't, Tania. I already have a girlfriend. Elena is my girlfriend. Why are you with Elena? I am more suitable for you. Come on, just be with me. I can give everything to you. Here, just take my ring and also take my bracelet. I have another thing for you. I brought all of this for you. Okay? What? I mean.. Are you serious? Yes. I have more at home. If you want them, I can bring them all to you. As long as you want to be my boyfriend. Just relax, Tania. I love you too. And I think... ...we are meant to be together. I'm pregnant? I have to tell Dirga. Dirga? - This is funny. - What? Let me see. Do you ever get a massage from other guys? Of course not. - I never get a massage. - Who is this? This is a friend of mine. Tania? What are you doing? What's the problem? Now you get out of my house. No, I don't want to. Dirga loves me, not you. - Tania, get out! - No! - I said, get out of here! - No! Get out, Tania! Get out! Get out! Dirga, you were.. Honey? You must die! I am Robert! I am Elena's lover, who was killed by you! Now you must die! You must die! Honey? - Dirga.. - Honey? Hey. What happened to me? You were just passed out for a second. Tania.. Dirga! Dirga! Tania? Tania, what's wrong with you? - Dirga! - Why are crying and calling "Dirga"? Tania? - Tania! - Dirga! Housekeeper! - Honey, snap out of it! - What's going on, Ma'am? - Housekeeper! - What is wrong with Tania? Do you know any paranormal? Alright, I'll find out about that. But why do you need a paranormal? Look, Tania is acting weird. Why is she calling Dirga? Last time, Elena was acting weird. I'm sure there's something odd here. Maybe this is all Dirga's doing. Dirga.. - Move it! - Tania! - Tania! - Miss! Oh my God. What should I do? I don't know, Ma'am. What's the matter with you? Do you hear that Cacomantis bird? Yes, I heard that. But just relax. Don't be scared. That bird is the omen of death. Oh my God! I hope nothing happens to your family. Ma'am, I should go back to the kitchen, okay? Alright. Dirga. How dare you cheat on me? She's the one who kept chasing me, honey. I only love you and nobody else. Are you sure you only love me? Alright then, I want you to marry me, okay? I can't do that right now. Just wait until I'm ready. I have a good news for you. I am.. I am pregnant with your baby. That's impossible! I'm sure you're lying. Dirga. - I need to go. I have business. - Dirga, please don't! No, you stay here! Don't come with me! Dirga! Dirga! Don't leave me! Dirga! Tantri? I know you're here. Now, be gone. Dirga.. I want to be married with you as soon as possible. Honey? - Honey, where are you? - Dirga, I'm over here. Dirga, I really miss you. Why are you wearing a wrap? I was dancing. Honey, do you have 100 million? I need that money now. You have it, don't you? I have 100 million. I will give it to you. But after you marry me. Honey, we will definitely get married. But I need that money now. Of course, Dirga.. So you can't give me that money right now? You have to marry me! - My belly is getting bigger every day! - Where is the money? - Where is the money? - No! Where is the money? Yes, I'll give it to you. But you have to marry me first! I'll definitely marry you later and take responsibility. - No. I can accept that! - Shut up! Can't you see that my belly is getting bigger? Can you understand what I'm saying? What's wrong with you? Why are you irresponsible like this? - Where is the money? - No way! - I will marry you later! Shut up! - Let me go! Just shut up! Honey? Honey? Honey? I'm sorry, Honey. - Honey, wake up! - Miss Elena! Miss Elena? Miss? Miss? Oh my God! Miss, wake up! Miss? Help! - Do you like the movie? - I loved it, honey. That kid was so cute! I want to pinch his cheeks. Well, go right ahead. Whose hair is this? Is this a hair? Who is in your house? There's nobody here. Dirga, did you see that? There was a shadow that quickly faded away. There's nothing there. I didn't see anything. She was wearing a white dress. There's nobody here. I live alone in this house. - Are you hiding a girl here? - No, I'm not. Honey? You are a cruel man! You have to come with me. Honey! Honey, don't do that! You only have lust in your mind! Haven't you done enough by killing my boyfriend? You also made me suffer! And now you intend to hurt my sister? - It's better for her to die! - Don't do that, honey! Don't! She is your own little sister! Mrs. Davina. This is Mr. Roni, a paranormal. He can cast out ghosts. Really? Mister, my name is Davina. - What's wrong, Mister? - Mister? It appears there are supernatural activities inside your house. The spirit is forbidding me to enter. (Chanting a spell) Mister! Oh my God! Are you okay? I'm okay. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. - Ma'am.. - Silence! Ma'am? I don't want to be too close. - What is it, Mister? - Where is your daughter? Please call Tania. Alright, Ma'am. (Chanting a spell) (Chanting a spell) Oh my God! - Mister! - Are you okay, Mister? What's going on? What happened, Mister? - Ma'am? - Mister? Mister? - Oh my God. - What should we do, Ma'am? Damn, we failed again. I'm sure Elena's spirit is haunting you right now. Please help me so that her spirit will not harm me, Auntie. You should be afraid of yourself, not some ghost! Just look at you! You have the character of a demon! You are a lazy man! You just want the easy way out! Your soul has no room for kindness! What did I do wrong, Auntie? I should've never given you that spell of affection! I should've thrown it away along time ago and never have given it to anyone! Now I really regret it! So what should I do now, Auntie? I want Elena's spirit to stop haunting me! You must break up with Elena's sister who is now your new girlfriend. I can't do that, Auntie. She has given everything to me. I can't break up with her! Aren't you ashamed of yourself, letting a woman provide for you? This is all because of my circumstances. You are just ungrateful! And your heart will never be opened if you aren't willing to accept your destiny! Where is Elena's grave? Peace be upon you. And upon you be peace. May I ask you something? Which one is Elena's grave? It's over there. The one where a woman is putting flower on top of it. Thank you. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you be peace. Excuse me, but who are you? You were watching me back there. My name is Serintil. I am Elena's dance teacher. But she never told me that she took dance lessons. I'm sorry. If I may ask... ...what is the name of Elena's father? His name was Songka Soedirja. He has also passed away. This is his picture. I will only entrust this child to you. Please take care of our child. Honey. Please take care of this baby as if she were our own child. I hope she will take good care of my daughter. I will call you Elena Mortensia. Actually, Elena was my foster child. I loved her... ...and cared for her as she was my own child. And not long after I took Elena to be my foster child.... ...I become pregnant... ...and gave birth from my own womb. Auntie. You murderer! What are you talking about? Elena was your cousin! And she was my daughter who I entrusted to Mr. Songka! I really loved Mr. Songka, therefore I was willing to become his mistress! But now you've hurt her until she was killed! - But how can this happen, Auntie? - Just forget it! You should throw away the Jaran Goyang spell! I hope nothing happens to you, just like my late husband... ...who died with his body burnt all over because of the Blawong Horse demonic fire! That means Elena's spirit is trapped in this world? Yes. Because Elena has become an offering to Ki Blawong. All this time, I have always kept the death of Mr. Songka a secret... ...from his real wife. Auntie, I am really sorry. Peace be upon you. Is Mrs. Serintil at home? I am delivering her dress. And upon you be peace. Hi, Azizah! Mrs. Serintil just went out a while ago. - Is her dress finished? - Yes, Tantri. It's done. - Thank you. - Please give this to her, okay? By the way, let me introduce you. This is Dirga, her nephew. Azizah. Alright, I should be going now. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you be peace. Tantri, who is she? She's really beautiful. She's a tailor and also teaches children how to read the Qur'an. Where does she live? Near a small mosque in this village. (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) (Reading a prayer) Alright kids, that's enough for today. Let's continue tomorrow. - Don't be late, okay? - Alright. - Alright then, peace be upon you. - And upon you be peace. Peace be upon you. And upon you be peace. Azizah, may I... ...go to your house? I'm sorry, Dirga. I never let a man inside my house alone by himself. If you want to visit my house, please bring Tantri of Mrs. Serintil. I will ask the children to come as well to accompany you. I need to go now. Peace be upon you.
