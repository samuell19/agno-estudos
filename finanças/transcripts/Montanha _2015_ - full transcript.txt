David... Where were you last night? Around... What's the matter? Granddad is still in hospital. Are you hungry? No. You don't understand Portuguese. Does she take drugs? Yesterday she asked after Granddad, just as she arrived. And what did you say? That he's gone to Siberia. - She believes anything you tell her. - Not anymore. Why don't you clean up this house? How long are you staying? Just a few days until granddad gets better. Is his car still broken down? Nowadays he packs the car with his old mates and drives around. - Does he still go to Bingo? - I don't know, I don't go with him. - Where do you stay? - Here at home or outside. Doing what? Usual stuff. Have you any news about your granddad? No, Mrs. Augusta, I haven't. - Is your mum here yet? - She arrived yesterday... Can you take these flowers to your granddad? It was the giraffe. Then... ...it was the monkey. - Ema, don't shout. It was the fox. - Miss? - Yes. Your father's awake. Ema... Stay here with David. You can come in after. I'm going to lie there, it's too crowded here. Now I'm lying down, I'm going to count to nine. I'll count to nine. To eight... With this leg and these two, two, one... - Ema, stay there. - Okay. Well...? How's granddad? Let's go. How is he? Tell me. He already knew he was sick and didn't say anything. Did he say anything to you? - Are you crying? - No. Let's go home. I don't want to. Is granddad coming with us? Not yet. Do you want to go in? I don't know. Here. Faster! They saw us. - What? - They saw us. Keep going, move it, move it! Let's go. Rafa! Hey Rafa! - Are you listening? - What's up, man? Did you tell anyone we were going to steal the motorbike? - You think? - The dudes were from my school. Let it go, man. Nobody knows you. You don't even go to school. I saw your mum yesterday. It was really weird. And I'm like: so, Monica, how're you doing? And she didn't answer, just stared like a statue. Well, what did you expect? Brother mine caught in the world of drugs Caught up in a life of petty crime You lost your son in a morning raid Shot and killed on the cobbled street He was only 13, just... 13 is all Only 13 years of age And the family could do nothing Nothing but weep and rage Paulinha's down there. Who? Paulinha! Paulinha... Do you want to come up? Do you hear? Do you hear? Catch the key! She's the best in your block. Huh, they're all old in my block. Hold him. Come here. There, there, there. It's strong. Give me a swig. Go back to your owner. Look at this. Here. You two are no good at this. Look here. - What do you mean, no good at this? - It's my cat. I'm scratched all over. David, pass me that book. Did you get it from the bin? Here. I'm gonna tell you, who your girlfriend is. Freaks. It's a book of freaks. Just so you know. It's really sexy. What's it got in there...? - Let's see. - Look! Great chick! Looks like the one you were with the other day. What a weird moustache... - And that crazy face... - He's got no hair on top. - And he's fat... - And he's got three tits. Must've made a packet just for being born like that. He could breastfeed three kids at once! Yeah. Actually, he could! Look here, Paulinha. So now you smoke as well? Well? You don't say anything? - You're all sweaty. - Does that bother you? - Where've you been? - Why? No reason. How come Gustavo already knows you're back? You been with him? No. But he wants to see Ema. - David! - Yes. I'd love you to come to London. You could come back with me. - I'm going to take some change. - Where are you going? You haven't got any... Just a sec, Ema. - Does this come off? - Yes, I'll take it off later. I'll get out at the traffic lights. Bye. Bye. Paulinha, do you want to get in my car? In your car? I don't think so. No? That one doesn't go. Careful, look out for me. Get out of my way! Haven't you seen her? No. She's never in the building. Paulinha's always like that, she disappears, see? You fucked my nose, man. You still got some money? Did you hear me? David? No. I haven't got none. Are you hungry? - No. - Come and sit down. Why? I got a chicken from Jorge's, sit down. - What have you been doing? - Nothing. - So why don't you eat? - I'm not hungry. You've got to eat, man. You're growing. Girls don't like skinny guys. Why did you come here? Have you ever seen Eusebio play? Now there's a footballer. Just look! Look, look... - The panther! - Did you bring my trainers? Why didn't you come and get them? Last time we talked, we agreed you'd come get your things. Have you forgotten the way? Tell me, do we have a problem, David? - No. - So what's up? Nothing. What is it? Gustavo? What's up? I come here to see your sister and she doesn't even remember me. She called me daddy. I wonder who daddy is. One of these days she'll only speak English. And you, are you David in a British accent now? Listen here. If your mother was seeing someone would you tell me or not? You're not helping like this, David. So, David. Do you smoke now? Why? I'm asking if you smoke now. Have a cigarette. I don't want. You don't want one or you don't smoke? You can smoke in front of me. Why would I smoke in front of you? Listen. How is your granddad? What's that mean? Have you been visiting him in hospital? What about your mum? Has she called you recently? Don't drag me into it. "Don't drag me into it"? I'm asking. We're friends. I'm asking because I care. Why're you doing this to me? Leave me alone, Gustavo. I'm asking in good faith. Do you know if she has a boyfriend? - Leave me alone, man. - Is she with someone? - I don't know. - Why don't you look at me? Why don't you look at me when I'm talking to you? Are you mad at me? Make it up with me, David. - Give me a hug. - Leave me alone. - Give me a hug. - Let me be. - Give me a hug. - Let me be! - Why did you let him in? - He just turned up. Gustavo's a shit. He came to see Ema. Can you look after your sister? I'm taking him home. You've got another guy, haven't you? No. She's going to cry all night. Granddad? Come here! Granddad, come here! It's me, Ema. Go to sleep. - You're nasty. - You are. - You're nasty. - You are! You are. Else I'll do this to you. Stop it. - Don't you want to go to sleep? - No. Look, an eraser. It's a dinosaur rubber. It is for rubbing out. Come here. Ema! - Don't you get fed up, Paulinha? - Just a sec, David. Do you want to go for a walk? I don't know. You never know anything. - The Chinese guy won. - What? The Chinese guy won again. You're really weird, Paulinha, why are you like that? I've known you since we were nine, I'm not going to play your game. Look, it's Marcelo's dad. No, it isn't, it's not Marcelo's father. It's Marcelo's dad. He jumped from here a year ago. It isn't. Look at the photo! I know Marcelo's dad. Look at this photo of him. - No, look closely at his face. - It is really him. Leave it. This belongs to the dead. "With great tenderness we remember the ideal husband and proud father." "Proud father"...? They were always arguing! His dad didn't even like him. Gerson was a lot worse. Yeah. Gerson! I still remember his face when he dived in. He never cared, did he? He was the only one who always dived straight into the quarry. But after a bit I said to Victor: "man, he's taking ages, he must've got his foot caught in the bars." Victor jumped straight in but Gerson must've grabbed him real tight and they both stayed here. We didn't do anything up top, just saw like bubbles on the surface. - Nobody else jumped in? Nah, we were like statues looking at the water. It was dead quiet. Not long ago, next to my building as well, I don't know if it was the building next-door, or another... the buildings are all the same, see? A woman from... It's got eight storeys, but it wasn't from the eighth floor. She threw herself off the roof of the building, man, pregnant. - Did you know her? - Nope. You saw it? No, well, I saw the body on the ground. Imagine. It was about six in the evening and I saw the body on the ground around seven. I was going past and there was loads of coppers there. They were like shouting: you can't come past here. Did you hear her fall? Don't be daft! How could I hear her fall? If you were there you would. In films, sometimes it goes like... splat. - Sometimes it's like... - You dumb fuck! Dumb fuck yourself! They say the sound's like... What is it, bro'? You're a fucking dick, man, piss off! - The sound of falling, man. - It makes a noise...! If she fell it could have gone... or like... it could have gone... What happened? You're really thick. Why's that such a strange question? You don't think it is? You're really stupid. Fuck off! Shut your face. Is it the bus 96? - Is that the 96? - No, it's the 36! What do you want? I haven't seen you for a while. - I had some problems. - Did you? Yeah. You've been on holiday all year, is that it? What about your mother? Is she there? Did she come back? I have a note from her. "From the parent/guardian to the class tutor." "I hereby inform you that I could not come with David to the meeting" "due to my father being in hospital." - "Thank you for your understanding." - You wrote this, didn't you? "Thank you for your understanding. Yours sincerely, Monica Morais." Who wrote that? My mum. You can't fool me again, David. If you want to believe it, believe it. If you don't, then don't. She wrote the note. It's hard to believe you when you're always lying. I don't lie. This is the third school that's taken you in and it always ends badly. Are you listening? Yes. Is the problem you or is it the school? I don't know. You don't know... Well? I don't like school. I'm sick of being inside a closed room with the teacher talking. Sometimes they don't even know what they're talking about. I don't feel good when I'm here. - Do you know why I called you? - I think so. You failed the year again. Doesn't it worry you? And why should it worry you? Don't you have your own problems? Everyone has. But I can solve mine. What do you want your future to be? I never thought about my future. Where do you see yourself in 10 or 20 years? Twenty years from now? As long as there's food on the table... Yes, but to have food on the table someone in the house has to work. And for all I know nobody does anything in your house. How do you know nobody does anything? How do you know? Mind your own business. Did I ask you who cooks or doesn't cook in your house? - You're not talking to your mother. - And you're not talking to your son. I'm sick of people doing my head in. David. David, we're not done. Sit down. You were seen stealing a scooter from the school gate. - Don't you want to give it back? - What scooter? If the police ask me for your address I'm going to have to give it. Have to give it?! I didn't do nothing. What the hell's this? I didn't do nothing and I get the blame?! Man, I'm sick of this shit. - Yes? - Tell Rafael to come down. - What? - Tell Rafael to come down. - Who's this? - David. What's up? Rafa, we need to talk, come on down. We have to get the bike from the swimming pool. It's causing trouble. - Don't be stupid. - I'm not being stupid. Are you the one at the school? Are you the one they're blaming? - Did they ask about me? - Why would they ask about you? What are you afraid of? Did I ever let you down? Who says I'm afraid? - But you're scared, aren't you? - That's not it. I won't let you down. Listen. Did I ever let you down? Did I ever let you down? - Does it smell of cigarettes? - No. - Granddad won't notice. - No? - Is he getting out today? - Yes. Come on. Is my father ready? - Are you Sr. Alberto's daughter? - Yes. He's coming home today after dinner. Let me check with the doctor. He's downstairs. I'll go and speak to him, all right? They told me he's coming out today. - Just a moment, ok? - What's going on? Is he in there? He can't breathe. Is he hooked up to a machine? Yes. What now? Are you hungry? Isn't he coming out today? Don't smoke here, this is a hospital, young man. "This is a hospital, young man." What time is it? Half past eleven. - Don't you want to go home? - No. Let's wait. I'll go and talk to the doctor again in a bit. He said he didn't know anything. Are you worried? David? I just want to get out of here. You want to stay here all night? Wait a bit with me, then we'll go. You got anybody at home? No. Aren't you watching this, it's really good! It sends me to sleep. Rafa? Are you laughing? Rafa? Watch it, man. Move your foot. Monkey, are you going to sleep here? Why? If you are, I'll go to your bedroom. Maybe Paulinha will stay over. I'm going to see Alice, tomorrow. Who's that? The girl at the party. Yeah? I thought you was mad at me and Paulinha. Really? Yeah, you got a face on like a corpse. - David, I think she likes me. - Are you sure? I see it when she's with me. So, what is it with you and Rafael? You get along well. We're friends, just like us. Sometimes you seem like more than friends. Think you'll see Alice again? Why do you talk so much about Alice? I'm just curious. I think I'd like to see her again. What's up? I can't sleep. Me neither. I'm going home. Paulinha... I don't have anyone else but you. You're all I've got. Don't say that. Stay with me. I have to go. I brought your trainers. They don't fit me anymore. - Did Ema stay with her dad again? - Yes. What is it? Didn't the hospital call this morning? I don't think so. I tried to see your granddad again yesterday. David... - I think he's very weak. - How come he's weak? He cooked me food before going to hospital, did stuff at home, took the bus on his own. What did he go to hospital for? I don't know. I think he went for tests. Didn't you sense anything? How could I sense anything? He was normal. Is Paulinha at Cris' house? I think so. Did you sleep with her? She fell asleep beside me. I want to get rid of the scooter, do you hear? No, you don't. Take a right here. We'll chuck the bike at the train. I already said I don't want to trash the bike. We could hide it here. I don't want to, enough with the shitty bike. - I'm tired of listening to you. - I'm tired of your shit. What's your problem? The bike can stay in that hole. - Give me the key. - Hands off my pockets, are you nuts! - Give me the key! - No! - Get your hand out of my pocket. - Give me the key. - You want the key? - Give me the key. Fuck off, let go. Let go! Leave me alone, you prick! - Leave me! - Give me the key! - Let me go! - Go and get it! I won't! Leave me alone! Leave me alone, you prick! Leave me! Let me go! Fucking liar! Liar! Can't you wait for me to finish? I'm not embarrassed around you. I don't like being in the bathroom with other people. I'll take a shower and we'll go out. Go out...? Yes. To the hospital. Go to the hospital for what? To wait? You don't get tired, do you? I'm scared too. Who said I'm scared? Don't you want to see him today? What are you trying to say? Tell me! What are you trying to say? Cris. Cris. Are you Cris? Who are you? David. Can I speak to Paulinha? She's gone. They said she was with you. So what? Is she coming back? I'm going to burn this place down today. Nobody else is going to sleep here. You going to help me, kid? - How old are you? - Almost fifteen. I'll be fifteen at the end of the month. Cris! Cris, come here. You're still alive? No. - I can't manage. - Do you want my lighter? Turn the light on. 44, 43... 42, 41... 40, 39, 38... 37, 36, 35... What's up? I don't want to go home. Aren't you going to sleep? I'm sleeping here today. Can you get me a blanket? - What's up? - You're drunk. 6, 5, 4... ...3, 2, 1. Yes. He's my granddad. She's not in. She'll be back later. Why? Yes. Were you there? Mother? What time is it? It's still early. Sleep. Sous-titrage: Eclair Group
