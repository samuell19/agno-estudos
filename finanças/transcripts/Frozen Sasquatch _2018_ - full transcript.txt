This is Dr. Arnold Prack. The creature has escaped, it's loose, on the base. Most are dead, killed during an attack during the night. The sounds you hear in the background is the creature coming for what few of us are left. We should never have experimented, we should have never tampered with nature. Whoever sees this, whoever hears this, please send.. Yeti! Yeti! Lance, Lance! Sheila! Hi! So good to see you! You used to like it when I held you that close. Oh that was a long time ago. Still friends? Of course, I'm just shocked to see you that's all. Same here! But what are you doing here? Got called to a meeting with Dr. Knob. Sounds pretty serious. Well that's what I'm doing. Destiny? More like a coincidence. We'll see. Come on let's go, see what the fuss is all about. Hello, come on in. Jensen, this is Lance and Sheila, they also work for me. Pleasure to meet you both. Drink? Well Dr. Knob, what's this all about? I have a flight to Argentina in five hours for a field study of indigenous tree frogs. Time's a wasting. What I'm about to tell you stays in this room, understood? Well? Are you all aware of our research facility in the Himalayas? The one that operates under our finances and scientific umbrella? Sure, it's no secret. Everyone is dying to spend time there on your team. Maybe not so much anymore. Did something happen? We're not sure. Doctor, you're being very evasive. We've lost contact with the facility for several days. What's so unusual about that? In the outer region of the Himalayas a simple power brownout can cause communication disruptions. It's more than that. Listen to this first. This is the last communication we had with the team. Please help us! If you can hear us please send help! It's loose, we can't control it! Several are already dead, we don't know how long we can last if we're cut off from contact! Please, it's close! It's... What the hell was that? An animal. Were they researching animal life at that region? If so it doesn't sound like they locked the cage doors properly. That noise, it's unlike any animal sound I've ever heard! Especially an animal of that region. Exactly right, this is a new species of life, yet undiscovered. That's incredible! But surely you know what it is? Well Dr. Knob, what is it that they found? A Yeti. I don't believe it! They're some kind of legend, superstitions! I'm not kidding, one bit! That would be the find of a lifetime. Yes, oh yes. Now that's why we have to go there, find out what happened. And to see if this creature can be captured. And that's where we come in, right? Precisely. Now I can't force you, but I am asking you, for my reputation, and the reputation of the company. Hell, I'll do it! Sweat my ass of in Argentina, or freeze my ass off in China! What's the difference? I'm curious, professionally, and personally. Is it dangerous? I won't lie, it could be. But we need you to go in and assess the situation. If it looks like we can recapture this species, we'll send in the proper team to finish the job. As you know, the Himalayas border India and China. Neither party likes our intrusion there, so don't expect any help from officials. The base is approximately right here. Now the spring season has started so travel will be much easier. You can expect varying climate situations. We'll arrange your transport by plane. By Jeep. Then a Snow Cat will take you into the snow regions. From there, you'll have to go in on foot. A supplied map will direct your way. I'm out of breath. It's probably the altitude. Please don't tell me we're lost! No, nothing of the sort but, we do have another half-day of travel on foot to the research center. It'll be dark soon. Let's pitch tent here and make camp. Exactly my thoughts as well. Let's break out the gear. Do you even know how to pitch a tent? I was in the Boy Scouts as a kid. You two sound like a married couple. At one time, maybe. While you two make house, I'm gonna go get wood for the fire. All right. Ta da! Oh! Never was very good with my hands. Oh, aw you know that's not true... Whatever happened to us Sheila? I don't know, maybe we just, leave it at that. Is that what you really want? I don't know, time will tell. Yeah, I believe so. You two don't have this thing set up yet? You handle the firewood, we'll set up the tent. All we need now are marshmallows and lonely cowboys. Do you think the Yeti really exists? I think they got a bear confused with a Yeti. You really believe that? You heard the last recording, that wasn't a bear. Then what was it, tell me? I haven't the foggiest idea, and that's what bothers me. I hope Dr. Knob was telling us the whole truth. Why wouldn't he? He was as perplexed as everyone else. We'll probably get there and find out that someone was using the microwave oven and the hair dryer at the same time, shorted out the electrical circuits. You know, when white man first saw a gorilla, he must have thought he was staring into the eyes of a monster. Gorillas only existed in legend until then. What are you getting at Sheila? All legends are based in fact, the Yeti, or whatever name current society has branded it with, it was here before man, was seen by native people, maybe even coexisted with them. The advancement of man both technologically and socially drove it into the far reaches of our world, and only survived in myth and legend. Well if these creatures do exist, why hasn't one been captured or photographed? Maybe it already has. Well we'll find out tomorrow, and I got first dibs on a selfie with it. I think we're all getting a little jumpy. We better head in for the night, we got another long day tomorrow. You think we should put the fire out? Yeah, like the snow and ice is gonna catch on fire. I hope you don't snore, Sheila. She doesn't. But he does. Whatever's out there I'm not gonna go investigate. It's too late and too cold to be scuffling with the Yeti tonight. Look, footprints! Well those are huge, and odd! Could a Sherpa have made them? In their bare feet, in this miserable weather? Yeti then? Let's not jump to conclusions, it could just be a bear. I forgot to mention that I heard something prowling around the camp last night. Why didn't you wake us? You were both snoring too loud. Besides, it was just a shape, it could have been anything. Yeah, what probably made these prints! Help me! Hold on! Give us your hand! Thanks! The ground just gave way! Well we all need to be more careful. Yeah, we better, someone might be following us. What? What makes you think that? The ground was deliberately dug out so that it would give way when we walked by it. Why would someone want to do that? To prevent us from reaching our destination. We made it, and there it is. It's so still, and quiet. Let's do what we came here to do. Can't be too hard to find a way in. Come on. Something was in a hurry to get in. Or in a hurry to get out. Looks like a hell of a storm blew through here. More prints like we saw earlier. And there's blood spattered on the ground. Well let's get inside and solve this mystery. There's an open door. Hello? Is there anybody here? We're from Dr. Knob's research group, hello! It looks as if everyone's gone, or in another part of the facility. Well let's scope out the inside but, stick together. Hello? Anyone here? Hello? It's odd. It's very odd. They should'a heard us, if anyone's here. This gets weirder by the minute! We have to find the main lab. If there aren't any people here, there at least have to be some records. She's right, that may be the only way we find out what went down here. The main lab must be at the end of this corridor. Maybe we aren't alone! If someone is here why didn't they answer back when we called for them? Maybe they can't. It came from over here. She's a research employee! The outfit's a dead giveaway! It's okay, we're here to help you. Who are you? What the hell happened here? Look we can't help you unless you tell us what happened! It was, Yeti, it was, it was (Mumbles)... Did she just say what I think she said? Yeti! She said Yeti! My god, this is unbelievable! What do we do now? We still have to find the lab. You wait here with her, see if you can get anything else from her. We'll go to the end of the corridor, see what the lab has to offer. Sound's like a plan. Sir, I'm begging you, help us (Mumbles). Oh, oh... Just like every other room. Look around, see if you can find anything. Lance, look at this? What do you think they had tied up here? The Yeti they captured. That broke loose and went on an ass kicking party from one end of this place to the other. This is a lab, don't you think it would be in a cage? They were doing tests on it, experimenting. Who knows. Maybe this can give us some insight. This is the main computer. It should keep records of everything that went on in here. Well it's a good thing the power's still functioning. Let's go across the hall, we can sit and access the computer. This place gives me the creeps. Sure. Jeez you scared me! Don't creep up on us like that! Sorry man. Look, she's rambling. I needed to find a place for her to lie down. You can put her on the couch over there. Did she say anything useful? Just that her name is Megan. She keeps saying something about a Yeti. That's probably more conversation than you get out of most of your dates huh? Find anything? Nothing yet. The lab across the hall looks like a zoo from hell. There's blood and hair all over the place. Great, she's our only survivor, and she can't even say anything. But these data disks can! We'll figure this out, we just need time. Well while you guys poke around in the computer, I'm gonna go look around some more. Okay, just be careful. Yes Dad. Any luck? It may take a bit to crack the password. You know how protective scientists are. You know, part of me wishes that we never agreed to this. We? Even though we've had our differences, I still care about you. Getting all romantic on me Lance? Next thing I know you'll be giving me that, we may never make it out of here alive, so let's spend the rest of our time together! No no I wasn't gonna say that. What, really? No, I did mean it. I knew it! You trickster! Get busy! Getting jumpy Jensen. Wonder what all this equipment is doing here. Almost there. We're in! It came from down the hall! What the hell did this? It was broken in from the outside. There's a million ways into this place without smashing your way through! Maybe it was a warning. I heard the glass break and I rushed back as soon as I could! I think there's something prowling around outside! Well let's get this blocked up. At the very least to keep out the cold. The experiment... We need to protect ourselves! My thoughts exactly! There have to be some rifles or pistols around here somewhere! Let's check in the lab! Bingo! Not much but, better than nothing. Loaded too. What's the plan? We need to go through the files, now that we're past the security wall. I'll keep watch, and take a look around. Here, keep us posted. We'll do the same. Got it, stay frosty! You too, good luck! Well this looks promising. Yeti Experiment? So this wasn't all a bunch of bull then. This file looks like it contains two weeks worth of work. There's some video files as well. Hmm, let's start with them. I hate reading. Jensen, do you read? Yeah what is it? Keep your eyes peeled for Yeti. It's the real deal, data has just confirmed it. I figured as much. Thanks, over and out. This is Dr. Masterson, Himalayan Research Facility with report number 24. Several days ago a Sherpa wandered into our base, incoherent and rambling. His party was buried in an avalanche, along with what he calls a Yeti. We gave his story no credence, but offered to send a few technicians to help him recover any survivors. That's when we discovered it. Just as he said, a humanoid being, half-simian and half-human in nature. It defies any species in existence today. We'll call it a Yeti for now but it will need a whole new classification. We sedated the creature and brought it back here. We have to keep close watch on it as it reacts violently, even when treated with kindness. We had one injury already moving it to its cage. Now we transport it on a gurney. Well that explains the hair and blood on the table. They really did it! What a discovery for science! Preliminary tests show it does not match any known animal currently classified. The Yeti is large, though not full grown, an adolescent by all accounts. It is intelligent and strong, with a voracious appetite for meat. We have been keeping it fed with some of our other test animals. It rejects any other type of nourishment. One interesting discovery noted is that its blood contains odd levels of Radion Six, a chemical compound often found in earthbound asteroids. Now that we have the specimen, there is much disagreement as to what to do with it, research-wise. Scientists never can seem to agree. More later, end of transmission. That tells us part of the story. Yeah but not all of it. Megan what happened, what happened to the Yeti? Oh, the Yeti... Yeti... What happened after the team brought the Yeti here? Experiments, see, Yeti... We're not getting much out of her until she gets some proper medical attention. Maybe she'll come around. There's more files to go through. Lance, this is Jensen! Did you find anything? Not really I, just a body, it looks to be scientist. What do you mean, what looks to be? Well the body's mutilated, really bad. The name tag says Dr. James Lockwood. All right, stay alert and make your way back here. I doubt there's anyone else alive. All right, over and out. Report log 72, James Lockwood dictating. Hey, we just found you! This creature, this find, Not funny! is significant, I've taken blood tests and DNA tests. It is by all accounts an infant. I have noticed my, my findings have been tampered with and my samples taken, then replaced, by whom or for what reason I don't know. This, this yeti is violent. It oozes hate and hostility. I suppose being tied to a table, caged, poked, and prodded doesn't help. I don't care, I want to preserve the animal, if it is an animal. I want to find a bridge, the link between man and beast. While it has all the traits of a bipedal animal, it's eyes, its black eyes, make you feel like you're staring into something more. Are we looking into ourselves, from hundreds of thousands of years, trapped in time? The mind reels at the thought. I just hope it sees more human in us, than we see in it. Logging out for now. Well, he certainly got his answer. The Yeti appears to be a vicious, dangerous creature! Look what it did here! Look what they did to it! How would you react to the treatment it obviously received? Certainly not with kindness! A free creature suddenly captured and experimented with? It was traumatized. You're right, I never thought about it like that. So let's keep digging. A story is starting to emerge here! Don't you mean a nightmare? What is it? She was dreaming! Look at her, she's sweating! And running a fever. Lie back down dear! Yeah, Yeti, yeah, experiment, (Mumbles)... We know. It's a Yeti, oh dear... We know. We should (Mumbles)... Dr. Mega Sprauling, Geneticist, log number 78. I have taken certain liberties against Dr. Lockwood's approval, to experiment on several genetic tests concerning the Yyeti. I fear that the samples, (Mumbles), even the creature itself will die or be destroyed, yet it will live on. The Missing Link, as it can safely be called, must advance, must develop, into what nature has stunted. I have found a willing subject to help me in this experiment, to assist me in the next evolutionary step, for this poor creature certainly on the verge of extinction! Call me cold, call me unscrupulous, call me ambitious, either way I have broken the record on reverse human-hominid development. I see it as an achievement, you may see it as cruel. Time will tell. The tests so far have yielded no results. Our Yeti subject seems to be losing its fight. Losing its will to live. At our next meeting I will recommend it be euthanized. I have all I need from it, end of report. Ah! No! No! It's obvious there's more to this capture than meets the eye. What are you getting at? Every one of those scientists had sinister motives of their own! I'm thinking that the Yeti was just a small part of what went down here! We don't have all the facts yet. I just think the Yeti broke loose and went ape-shit, simple as that! There's something going on here, I just can't put my finger on it. I better check in with Jensen. Jensen Jensen, do you read? Jensen! Jensen, Jensen, do you read? Jensen! I'm gonna go look for Jensen. Oh, maybe the battery went dead. He could be on his way here right now. Or he could be in trouble. Better safe than sorry. Hey! Be careful. This is Dr. Arnold Pratt, the creature has escaped, it's loose, on the base! Most are dead, killed during an attack during the night. The sounds you hear in the background, is the creature coming for what few of us are left! We should never have experimented, we should have never tampered with nature! Whoever sees this, whoever hears this please send.. Jensen! Jensen, answer me! Damn, where could he be? Oh my god! Jensen! Sheila, Sheila! Right I'm here! I found Jensen, he's dead! Stay where you are, I'm on my way back! Mmm kill you! No, oh! What? What happened? Well it was awful she, she turned into this thing, and attacked me! I don't get any of this! The Yeti didn't do all of the killing around here! She went and did some of it! Don't you see, the experiment? She was the experiment, not the Yeti! One of 'em messed with her DNA! Well at least it's over, at least this part of it! Here, sit down. What was that? Sounded like someone making off with equipment or something. Come on. No no no! We can't do much more here! Besides, we still have the mystery. Why is he taking equipment? Curiosity maybe? We need to get to the communications center and call for help. It's not too far, we passed it on the way here. It's gone! The yeti must have taken it! Now what? Well we need to find supplies, and get back down the mountain! Out there we'll be sitting ducks! Aren't we better off staying here? At this point we're not better off anywhere! I'll hold it off, you get past it and out of here! No! Do it! In here! Oh! We're safe for now. It's okay, you're okay. (Mumbling) A humanoid being, half-simian and half-human in nature. This Yeti is violent! It oozes hate and hostility! (Mumbling) It is intelligent and strong, with a voracious appetite for meat. Our Yeti subject seems to be losing its fight. Losing it's will to live. One interesting discovery noted is that its blood contains odd levels of Radion Six, a chemical compound often found in earthbound asteroids. Sorry, sorry! Bad dream. That's understandable. I don't hear anything. Let's get out of here. Stay put, and don't move until I say so! What? Now! Glad you had a plan! Glad that power box had juice, or we'd be dead! Come on, let's get out of here! Now what could it be? Where there's offspring, there's parents! Let's get out of here before the building collapses! That's one big mother... Run! They're not even from this planet? So much for them being primitive! The doctor on the recording said the specimen contained new radiation, he must have come from space! Unbelievable! What's unbelievable is how close to death we are! Let's hide inside! Right! This stuff looks like it came from the lab! They're trying to repair the ship, so they can go back to wherever they came from. People have been seeing Yetis and Bigfoots over a century! Native Americans, hundreds of years before that! They're aliens, not some ancient relatives of a monkey! I guess you could put it that way. Look out! It's too big to get in! Yeah in this place, but not the ship! They came here in it remember? What are we gonna do? We know they hate electricity. Over there! It'll shock the crap out of him! Hey ugly, come and get it! We have to get out of here! Do you think that's the last of 'em? I don't know, time will tell. There's some caves nearby, we'll hide in them til morning and keep going from there. Lance! That one is much larger than the others! It's huge! This is Dr. Masterson, Himalayan Research Facility with report number 24. Several days ago a Sherpa wandered into our base, incoherent and rambling.
