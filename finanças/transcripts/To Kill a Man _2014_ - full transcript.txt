TO KILL A MAN CENTER FOR FOREST RESEARCH - Hello? - Hello. Are you there already? No, Marta, I'm just getting there. Can you pick up the cake? Did you tell Nicole? Is she there already? She was late today. Vanilla... or raspberry and pineapple. Bring the pineapple one. - Okay. - And buy some bread. - Sure, okay. - For tomorrow. - Thanks, bye. - Bye. Hey, kick it over here. Hey, sugar daddy, kick the ball! Kick it back, fucker! Kick the ball, you old fucker! Hey, listen up! Eyes on the ball! Eyes on the ball, everybody! - Hi, honey. How are you? - Hi, Dad. Good, and you? Good, just a little tired. And your mom? Upstairs, cutting someone's hair. - And Jorgito? - I don't know. He's not here yet. Hello, can you go buy some beers for Jorgito's friends? Okay, I'll go right away. Got a cigarette? Or whatever you have. The drugs are killing us, help us! You smell good, what a great perfume. What do you have for us? Hey, man. I'm asking you to help us out here. Give it here or else you'll really have to pay. Shut up, all of you assholes! I don't have anything. I'm just coming back from work. He's such a loser. He's dressed like a tramp. Do you have credit? Answer the question, asshole! Shut up, motherfuckers! Like you would have credit, motherfucker. If I steal this, I'll end up paying your bills. Take this! And this crap? It is a blood sugar test. I'm diabetic. And I'm agnostic. What do you want it for? I need it. Sure, sure. Pick up your crap and get lost. - Hey, come on. - Do you want me to hit you? Pick up your crap and get lost. Come on, that's it. Go. Do you think we can sell this thing? That asshole lives up in the projects. He sells stolen cell phones. If you don't want to call the cops... give me 5,000 pesos, and I'll buy the thing back. You need that thing. Tomorrow I'll go by the clinic and try to get one. While I wait for the new one, I'll prick myself twice daily, like before. It really pisses me off. They even messed around with me the other day. I don't know why they come to the soccer field now. They used to be further down the road. That pisses me off too. All that talk about safe neighborhoods. The cake is ready. - Shall we sing? - Yes, it'll cheer us up. One, two, three. - Nicole, do you know where Jorgito is? - He went out. He asked me for money and I gave him 5.000 pesos. - Is something wrong? - No, go to sleep. Good night. - What's happened? - Nothing, I'm going out for a second. Jorgito! Holy fuck! What have they done to you? Motherfucker! I was in my house and they came and shot me. It was in self-defense! Let me go. I didn't do anything! Why are you treating me like this? I'm bleeding to death, Officer! Sir, get in, come on. Marta, hurry up please. I'm coming! - Come on, Nicole. - Coming! Mr. Álamos, do you understand the terms of your deal with the prosecution... and the consequences of that deal? Yes, I am. Were you pressured by the prosecution... or any other person to accept this deal? No. Do you know the facts of the accusation... - and the procedure of the investigation? - Yes, I do. Do you accept them as written in the accusation? - Yes, I do. - Anything further to state? Yes, sir. I would like to state that I am innocent. I was unjustly accused. These people shot me and I was injured. Excuse us, Your Honor. Mr. Álamos, let me repeat. Do you know the facts of the accusation and the procedure of the investigation... and accept them as written in the accusation? Okay, yes, I know them. Ma'am, we don't have witnesses for a trial. No witnesses? His dad was with him. - This is the best— - Excuse me. What is a convicted prisoner? It's the term used in court that means he is going to jail. And 541 days is the maximum for... It is the maximum sentence for serious injuries. It's nothing compared to the harm done and all this time in bed. A year and a half in prison, ma'am? What about my son? He won't be able to finish high school. Marta, what did you expect a judge to think? Someone goes banging on someone's door... and witnesses say Jorge wanted to sell him drugs. He had just mugged you! I listened to the DA because Jorgito asked me to. I don't know what you said, but you convinced him. - So it's my fault? - Happy now? That night you could've talked to him, instead of watching TV. Run away now! But be careful... There are some kids playing soccer out there! - What's wrong? - I left without my keys. I'll close it. Bye. TWO YEARS LATER We got to the beach and the first thing to hit you... is the smell of seafood, the smell of the sea. Unlike the smell on the bus, that was "knee smell." Half foot smell, half ass smell. Right at knee level! Jorgito, don't play the fool. You gonna have to pay me for what you did. You have one new message. Jorgito, the other day I passed by your house. I saw your wife and daughter. They are yummy, man. What's going on? Open the door! Help! Help, please! Open the door! Don't rock the truck! The things are going to fall down! Don't rock the truck! - Hello? - Dad, hi. I'm calling to find out if Kalule has been threatening you? Yes. He's been harassing my mom, Nicole and me. One night I was walking down a street... and they started to throw empty bottles at me. And they threatened to hurt me and my family. And that isn't the first time it's happened. Since this isn't the first time it's happened... my advice is to file separate complaints. That way each of you can file a complaint... and the DA will have a stronger case. - Good night, Contreras. - Night, sir. - It's time to change the guard. - As soon as I finish here, sir. Okay. So let's do as you say. Let's start with you. This afternoon, as I was washing my truck... - Is he still there? - Yeah, looking at us. Don't get up. - Looks like he's gone. - Is he? Yeah, he's gone. We should get going. Close that. Let's go before he comes back. After that, I went to Jenny's house. - So? - So I don't know what happened next. That man will never leave us alone. - I'm fed up. - Sit down and drink some water. What can you do? He almost killed my son. After a year and a half in jail... he's out and threatening us. And they're the type who follow through. He is an evil man. Maybe he's obsessed. I don't know what his problem is. Take it easy. - How can I take it easy? - No, just relax right now. Look. The petition for a restraining order has been sent to the judge. Now we have to wait for him to decide. He has a restraining order... I don't know. You can ask the judge later. - Can we see the DA? - She's on another case. So she's not going to see us? And the revocation of his parole, that won't happen either? The order is a precautionary measure. It doesn't mean that a crime has been committed... What do you want? For my son to die? - Take it easy. - Take it easy! Keep this up and I won't be able to help you. It's your job to help me. That's your job! - Not to be a whore! - Let's go! Sergito, can you come to the second floor? Who do you think you are? I hope this happens to you... - so you know how it feels, bitch. - How could you! Motherfucker, there you have your restraining order! You can stick it up your ass, motherfucker! Nicole, call the cops. Jorgito, go and get the camera! Motherfucker! I'm tired of you assholes! I'm tired of all of you motherfuckers! - Did you call? - Come out, assholes! - Give me the phone. - Come out, motherfucker! - Hello? - Son, be careful. - Good night. - Good night. - Tell me what happened. - A man threw stones at us. Kalule. Do you know this person's name? Luis Alberto Álamos Álamos. He lives there in the projects. Or lived there, I'm not sure. He mugged my husband, or rather ex-husband Jorge. And shot my son. Since he got out of jail, he's been following my daughter. He was behind bars, but now he keeps bothering us. Jorgito was hospitalized for three months. - You're saying he threw stones at you. - Yes. Do you have any witnesses? My daughter took photos and the neighbors saw it. - Should I bring the photos? - We'll look at evidence later. At what time did this happen? At 7:00, 7:30 or so. Okay. Okay. Any other piece of evidence? Yes, but what will happen? He has a restraining order and he hasn't been arrested. - He won't leave us alone. - Don't worry, we understand. We'll take the evidence to the DA. - He'll decide what to do. - As always! You leave us unprotected! - It's true, Jorge. - Calm down. - Don't worry, ma'am. - Always the same story. Marta, easy now. We're tired, sir. Don't worry. We'll deliver the evidence. Good-bye, sir. - No fires allowed here. - Says who? It's a private area, and you could cause a fire. - And who are you? - I'm the caretaker here. - Caretaker of what? - This whole area. What the fuck? You can't make a fire. This is a private area. From there to the beach, no problem. But not here. - Put it out. - I'm cold. - Put it out, now! - Back off, asshole! Put it out. - Do it yourself! - Take it easy! Take it easy, motherfucker! - Calm down! - Fuck off, asshole. - Get lost now! - Cool it, man. What the heck? - Get lost, asshole. - Calm down. - Fucking tramp, get lost. - Fuck. Go now! Run, asshole! Fast! I'm gonna come back and you'll see. Calm down, man. Help! No! Let me go! Someone help me, please! Let me go! A little kiss for your brother and another for your dad. - There are people watching. - Shut up, asshole! They're going to get you, hurry up! Smell her, she stinks. Hey, don't fall in love with me! Send my regards to your daddy. Marta! Hello, Marta? What happened? What? At the hospital? What happened? Hey, Marta, I can't hear you. I'm losing the signal. Hello, Marta! - Good evening. - Good evening, miss. How's my daughter? She's all right. We sedated her because she was very agitated. - I think you can take her home soon. - And her face? We could only verify minor injuries. Scrapes and some bruises. There's no sign of sexual abuse. - Luckily. - I'm going to tell the nurse immediately... to write a report you can take to the police. - Will he be arrested? - I don't know, ma'am. I'm a doctor. Can we see her? I'd like her to rest for now because she came in very nervous. - That's it. Good night. - Good night. I'll take the report straight to the police. All right. Good evening. I'm calling regarding a report of assault with minor injuries. Yes. Just the report from the hospital. Okay. Yes. Okay, thank you very much. Good night. We can't do anything until Monday. Do you have the DA's address, so I can go to talk to her? She can't see you now. - There's no way she'll see me? - No, she's too busy. - You'll have to wait until Monday. - Good night. Good night, sir, and good luck to you. Freeze, motherfucker. Okay. Take it easy. Keys on the ground. Turn around. Walk to the truck. Go to the truck! Walk. Look forward, asshole! Walk, fucker, walk. - Open the door! - Okay. Easy, man. - Open the door! - Okay, okay. Open it! Open the door! Hurry! Hurry! - Get in the back! In the back! - Easy. In the back! - Over there. - Take it easy. Let me go, motherfucker! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you and your whole family! Jorge, please. I can't feel my legs. I'm just a prankster. Leave my family alone! Jorge, you believe in God, right? Me too. Leave them alone and I won't kill you. I'm just a prankster, Jorge. Please, I can't feel my legs. Move to the back. To the back! - Are you listening? - Yes, I am. Don't do this, Jorge. You're a good guy. - To the back. - You're a father. Killing a man is difficult. You're going to go to jail. Why endure that? You'd leave your family all alone. To the back, hurry. I have friends. Don't get yourself in trouble. - Hurry up. - I'm hurrying! I like to play pranks. Move to the back. I'm gonna cut your tongue out... and stick it up your ass! Don't pay attention. I'm just kidding. Don't lock me up! Let me go, motherfucker! I'm gonna kill you, asshole. Let me out! I'm going to kill you! I'm gonna fuck you and your whole motherfucking family! Are you listening to me, fucking fatso? Let me out! Where are you going? Don't leave me alone here, Jorge! Come on, Jorge! I have some money that I can give you. You already humiliated me. What else do you want? What are you doing? The truck is not running! What are you doing? Come on, say something. Please turn off the cold, man! Jorge, I'm freezing! You're going to kill me! Please let me out of here. I'll move to a new city. I'll leave you all my money. Are you listening, you cuckold! Do you have ears, you pig, you cuckold! Come on, please stop it! What are you doing? Where are we going? Are you taking me out to dinner? Are you crazy? Jorge! You're crazy! Turn off the engine! How are you? Good. What did this guy do to you? Let her rest. She's in a bad state. That guy won't bother you ever again. How long are you staying at your sister's? Two or three weeks, until things calm down. That guy won't bother you again. He'll never stop. Can I have the truck keys? Jorgito is packing some clothes at home. Last night we called you many times but you never answered. My battery was dead. Don't forget the DA on Monday. They won't do much, but... I'll go anyway. I also want you to give me the keys to the house. Can I take a look at the place... No, I want the keys. - Want to say good-bye to Nicole? - Yeah. - Time's up. - Hey, no. Wait a minute. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. How are you? - Something happen? - Sort of. We have an order from the DA to investigate a disappearance. Who? A man named Luis Alberto Álamos Álamos. - Also known as Kalule. - Ah, okay. Since when? He was reported missing five days ago. And the last person who saw him was one of his friends in the projects. And why are you telling me all this? Didn't you request an arrest warrant against him? I did. His relatives think you and your son have something to do with this. As there was some tension in court, that's what they think. But we have nothing to do with that. Well, that's why we came here. - Are you here to arrest me? - No. We just want you to give us your version. - Okay, but I need to change my clothes. - No problem, we'll wait here. Mr. Contreras states that the very same night, he went to the DA's residence... where he requested that she issue an arrest warrant for the accused... which petition was denied. Following that, he affirms that he went to the nightclub Ardor... and from there to Motel Azul accompanied by a woman he met there. Afterwards, the deposed states that he went to the hospital... to learn the state of his daughter's health. Since then, he has been working at the Santa Lucia Research area. It's there that he was met this afternoon by a patrol car from this precinct. He also states that his declaration was not coordinated with Marta Martínez... or their son, Jorge Contreras Martínez. Please sign here and thumbprint here. They already gave a deposition? Yes, they did. They gave us the address of your hostel and workplace. - Your mom? - She's asleep with Nicole. I'm going to bed too. Do you want to watch TV? - I'll leave you the remote. - I'll turn it off later. Good evening, sir. Why are you here? BASED ON A TRUE STORY
