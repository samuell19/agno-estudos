Eh? Eh? Er, but I did repurpose some spare index cards I had lying around the office and I asked Susie to write some, I guess you would call them jokes on here for you. Let me just, uh, get out my glasses and if I could just find them... Oh! Uh... Oh! Right here on my nose! Weren't they? I'd got my dollars worth if they'd been a west end girl and as my Pappy used to say. Uh... Now then, uh... Why was the secretary in the cake... to bust her husband out of jail? Uh, then in parentheses, on the card here it-it... it says “filing.” Well, that wasn't a very funny joke at all. Ha-ha! Yes. Hello. Uh, yeah, get-get him out of here. Go.

Nice fishing rod you've got there. Oh, it's nothing special, just how I earn my keep. Nonsense! Why, I bet that thing's got a thousand fish in its day. Maybe so. Never had any other rod. You craft that yourself? Not me, but my pappy did. Yes, sir, a genuine native fishing pole. Tell you what, I don't normally do this, but I'll trade you six dollars for it. What? No, you can't have my fishing pole. $10. I need it! How about if I give you an exclusive deal to rent the pull back on a month-by-month no commitment contract? No! Now scat you lousy businessman! I'm trying to enjoy myself. Come on I'm not stopping you from doing your job. This is my job. I need to buy something or this whole expedition becomes a waste. I don't have anything but this pole and I'm not selling it. What about your skin? I used to be a tanner - and uh... - My skin? - Are you out of your mind? - I tell you I won't go home empty handed Then wait here a bit and I'll catch a fish to sell you. Well... All right.

So save yourself those awful sounds by making sure your knives... are sharp. Thank you for the skin. Here is your $3. What? You said 10! Ah, there was a seven dollar fee to remove it. Did I not mention that? That's outrageous. Love to discuss the particulars, but I really must be off. Business, you know. I'll have a receipt sent your way. Ta-ta! Well, how do you like that? At least I still have my fishing pole. Whoa, Nelly! This is a big one. Congratulations, Gutboy.

They put me into such a trance. Wait, how did that gun-wielding, muscle-clad, pig-eyed broken-nose of a policeman sire such a... gorgeous daughter? Well, that's what he asked himself 15 years before. I'm going to whip this island into shape! Everywhere I look! Thief! Ow! Oh! Murderers! No! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, what am I going to get at the market today? Jaywalker! Oh! Well, it's not my first job and it won't be my last. Light on... Yep, okay... Unlicensed boat salesman! Woah! Woah! I'm so scared... This is scary, I... Well, at least you waited until he signed the contract. This scumbag has been trying to sell boats for 15 years. Indeed. And why's he remained unlicensed this whole time? Are you dumb or something? The last town clerk died two decades ago. Who's gonna give out the licenses? Oh, I'm no dummy But I've just arrived in town My name is Besto, and I'm a... Fur Trader. Oh, pleased to meet you. What brings you to our island? Ah, professional squabbles. I was deposited here by some colleagues who were uninterested in a certain... proposition of mine. Nothing illegal, I assure you. Hey! On this island, I'm the boss, yeah? I'm the line you better not cross. But when you're on the lawless sea, man what you do doesn't matter to me! Oh! Oh... Well... Aren't you a vision? Well, you've found my little girl! Thank you so much, Kug. All in a day's work sir, and... Miss. Oh, Annabelle, you don't have to be scared. Thank the policeman for saving you, dear. Oh, okay... She's shy but thank you! Such a beauty! It's a shame she's already married. Married? She's the farmer's girl. I think that would make her his daughter. Daughter? Or else you have very liberal laws on this island. No, we don't have that! I suppose it was his... - Daughter. - Daughter. What's a daughter? And then a baby crawls out from between the woman's legs. Wait... I still don't grasp what- You do it to me, then! It won't work either way. You just don't want me to have a daughter! Preposterous. Good day to you, sir. Don't walk away from this, Besto Don't walk away! My dear woman, is it permissible that I propagate a child into you? Get lost! Sweet lady, might I impose on you to allow a brief impregnation? You're disgusting! Ugh! Charming Miss, Charming Miss, - Could I require- - Why, Kug. - Could I require- - Why, Kug. - What? - How nice to see you again. Hardly. Have you been propositioning all the women at this Cafe? If you must call it that, Yes. I read about it in a book. It's very proper. Why, that's no way to find a mate. Well, you've certainly been little help. Now watch this. Hmm... Oh, miss. Thank you, Miss. Say... You're new here, aren't you? I thought I was getting off at Waikiki, now I'm stuck. Oh, well that's amazing. Why? The exact same thing happened to me. You don't say? Now, don't think me too forward, but I was thinking of attending the market Master's ball. And I was wondering- Get to the point! What's this got to do with making daughters? Ah! Teach your friend some manners why don'tcha? Maybe I should. But then... Maybe... I shouldn't... Kug, I have a plan. WHAT? Come on, ladies you know the law. Kug, you ugly old mango What are you enforcing that old poop for all of a sudden? Yes. Yes. Yes. That appears to be all of them. Very good, Kug. Now, come back at sunset in your best clothes. Ladies, ladies. I'm so sorry Kug treated you so rudely But there's one small favor I want to ask of you. I promise compensation riches, power too! It's not too tough if you ask my view but once the party starts tonight, ust cling to Kug and hold him tight. I promise you he will not fight. He wants a kid. He needs a kid. No, no, no, no love for a cop who would lock us away and chain us up! Especially with such an ugly crop of hair. And no hygiene to speak of. Ladies, wait! You don't understand. Kug is really a powerful, man. Is really a powerful, man. He could put you in positions of authority. Or at least when you're working, he could Or at least when you're working, he could leave you be. Leave you be. It's out of the question. No way, man! Not for money, power, jewels a shop, or even land! Why, I never met such Why, I never met such an obstinate group of violators of city ordinance an obstinate group of violators of city ordinance Isn't there even one of you Isn't there even one of you who's out just to make a buck or two? Who's out just to make a buck or two? I'll do it. Porking me ain't easy and diddling me ain't fine. But if he aims it right, and shoots his coppers good, I'll squeeze him out a kid or two that will look just like him. But I want lots of money And I ain't fake no prim. No, no, you certainly won't fake any Prim. Sorry, man but if you don't meet the dress code, I can't let you onto the boat No, no, no what are you doing? Kug is our guest of honor. Come on up, I love your hat! Tre dashing! Pig-licking dandy. You ever been on a yacht before, Kug? No. Oh, it is absolutely the best. Drink up. Oh, no. It's against the law to drink while I'm on duty. And I'm always on duty. Did you forget? You're on the sea now. No laws out here. There's... no... lawless sea! My God! Hiyaa! I'm gonna be mayor! Woah! - Gimme, gimme that sash! - Mr. Mayor I am so sorry! I am so sorry! Kug, get off! Kug, get off! What were you thinking? Oh, quite all right, Besto. I'm still young and popping!

It's a... Besto! It's a frog thing! Of course it's a frog thing. This was your first try. You can't expect to get it right immediatley. Do it again. Come here you nasty old buffalo. Besto! No, no, no. Do it again. - Oh, oh oh. - I'll just put this over here. Can anyone else do anything right? How many more? Frog thing again. Oh... Oi, oi, oi, oi. No. Get out of there! Wrong! Is it a girl yet? Frog thing! Oh! Incorrect. Besto! Another frog thing. Oh no... Kubble's just about kaput. It's too much. You gotta pay me more for this, this is... hurting me long-term. You promised me a daughter! All right listen, you two... just keep at it. I've got a plan. Yes, crops are bad this year And you with that extra mouth to feed. Oh, things aren't looking good for old Plop. No. No, they aren't. If only you had a job that didn't depend on the weather. Say... I'm a good friend of the mayor. I'm a good friend of the mayor. How would you like to be the new town clerk? How would you like to be the new town clerk? What? Me? But I can hardly read! It's no matter. I just need one little thing. And I promise I could do this operation with a minimum of pain I've had the notion for quite some time. I've got it! Ah. Haha. Oh... Ah... Hmmm... Hmmm? Maybe I can just put the... Well! Maybe she'll grow into it. Wake up you happy pappy! Huh? May I present... your daughter. Kubble! Kubble, wake up! It's a miracle! Now I have a daughter of my own! Oh, Besto, you're the best friend I could have ever hoped for! Oh... She found her own way out, did she? Well I still want my money, Besto. Of course, dear Kubble. I happen to know of a rather large farm I happen to know of a rather large farm that I believe the town records will indicate is in your name. That I believe the town records will indicate is in your name. Pays me in dirt? Ugh... How do you like that? Now everything will be good forever! I will call you... Sophia. But all was not good forever... for after 15 years festering on the ocean floor... Plop's daughter has risen as... Gutgirl! Gutgirl! And is now trudging towards Sophia And is now trudging towards Sophia to force her into permanent matrimony with her love... the bizarre monster... Gutboy! Beautiful Sophia, 15 years ago, you stole my skin Now my one true love has fallen in love with it Now my one true love has fallen in love with it and I need it back! And I need it back! And I need it back! I don't know what you're talking about, you crazy monster! I don't know what you're talking about, you crazy monster! Quiet! If you don't give me my skin back, I'll drown us all in blood! So help me I will, I know how to breathe underwater! Okay, wait! Give me a chance, at least I-I don't think I ever stole your skin but if I did, I certainly didn't mean to Be fair. I will trade you my skin for the answer to a riddle. Very well. Okay. Um... Okay. Hold on, okay. I've just begun trying to utter my name and if I cannot then it's you that's to blame. Submerged in dark waters, I see, hear and smell. Allowing abstraction in you do I dwell. What am I? My brain, yes, very well. Now, to sign the marriage contract. So long, beautiful Sophia. I'm off to claim my groom. Wait! What? I said I'd trade you my skin for the answer to my riddle. The answer to my riddle was your brain! Give me your brain! Well, that worked out better than I could have hoped. NO!! Whoa... What am I now? I Such a mix of memories and powers but I feel completely new and... so refreshed! Hmmm... Well, they are married now I suppose. I had better go warn Gutboy. Gutboy Get up! You're in a pickle! My head hurts. Yeah, it's bleeding. What? Oh, right. So, the good news is, you're married to Sophia! Really? That's wonderful Really? Well sorta. It's more accurate to say that a chimera of Gutgirl and Sophia with the skin Sophia had been wearing for so long has and may enforce a license of marriage. Okay. Wait, aren't you Gutgirl? I was. I was Gutgirl and I was Sophia We kind of got mixed up. There was a brain swap. You can call me... Sophieguts Prettybutts. I think it's accurate enough, don't you? Anyway, she's the one with the thumb prints. Oh. Oh. I don't think it's quite fair to call her Sophia, though. I don't think it's quite fair to call her Sophia, though. I don't think it's quite fair to call her Sophia, though. So I'll call her Skingirl! So I'll call her Skingirl! I say she'll enforce the contract because All of my old obsession with you is gone. So it must have ended up in her. Along with my anger, evil daddy issues, along with my anger, evil daddy issues, And overwhelming sexual mania. And overwhelming sexual mania. Oh... Yeah, I can still play piano, though which is pretty cool Neat! I would apologize, but most of the guilty parts ended up in her but the more evil she is, the more I pity you, the more I pity you, even if I'm not guilty. Even if I'm not guilty. So. I thought... I could offer you another wish to make up for it. Really? I could... nullify the marriage contract. Or... whisk you away to France! - Or... - No! Nuts to love! You missed it, but these guys all came and stole my fishing pole! I want revenge! Perfect! Who are the fiends? Plop the clerk, Kug the policeman, and most of all, Besto the capitalist. Consider it done. Hold on there! I don't want you... draining spleens or whatever your weirdo idea of revenege is. Fair enough. What do you propose? I'm coming with you. First, we're going to Plop's house. He should be having this midnight tea now. And I want to fish it. What? Put a fish... in his teapot. But... Hold on. Where can we get a fish at this hour? You forgot. I used to be a fisherman. Woah! You two? The new servants? The host is getting stranger and stranger taste these days. Indeed. Well, take him his tea. Perfect. Plop? Oh! We brought you your tea! But it's impossible! Back from the grave? Ooo! Finally come for me! That's... a downer. - Let's go to Besto's - Let's go to Besto's Poppy, poppy, Pappy! Please eat my pill! You can play policeman if that eases how you feel. But Pappy or policemen, you have to help if first I still I promised I can wed my lover, he will only yield. I know he'll try to weasel that, I know he'll try and run! And that slutty, skanky, skinless girl wrongly gets all in the fun. You have to help me stop them! So that we can become one! You could knock him out or tie him up, or scare him with your gun! But I need your help convincing him and freshen up and clear your meaty head. Oh that you inspire dread! Oh, I sit out the quickest route to Good lord. I know that scream. Kug will be awake soon, we better be quick. Okay, but keep quiet. - Shh! - Okay! Jeez! Uhhh... Uhhh... Well, I'm out of ideas. I know a secret way in! How'd you know that? It's from beautiful Sophia's brain. But how would Sophia know a secret entrance to Besto's house? It doesn't make any sense. Gutboy! Whoop! Royal blue. Whooaaa Gutboy... What-I wasn't doing anything! Great revenege idea! Ooh, right! Look... Besto uses this huge hammer to crack his worker's skulls for breakfast. He eats brains. Ech! He should be asleep right now in that huge fancy bed of his. We can sneak into his bedroom, raise that hammer and give him a serious Bonk in the face. Gutboy? That's a pretty good idea. But I've got one that's way better! Let's drink all his wine! Rhinocerai and elephants love to do... the wine-o dance. Woo! Cuttlefish and swordfish too do the wine-o bugaloo Champagne is great with pretty girls but dancing's best with animals. Woohoo! Oh lordy! How are we going to drink all this wine? One bottle at a time. Ha! No way! That'll take us a hundred years. No it won't. Watch. Oh... maybe not such a good idea. Oh man! It's Besto! Quick! Hide the bottles! I'm not going to hide the bottles! I want him to see! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. We gotta put-we gotta put all these bottles under this rug. Ugh, what is this rug made out of? Let's show Besto. I'm proud of what we did. Besto! You are a garbage man- What- Intruders. One second. Oh my god, they're huge. Oh. Idea! Intruders? Where? You. You aren't Intruders? What, us? Who are you, then? Why... We're Besto's wine disposal technicians.. Yeah, that! Oh, our mistake. Well, we'll let you get back to your work. Wait! Um... There's a way too much wine. If we can't get rid of it all, Besto will chop us up. He is such a mean, man. But what's that got to do with us? I'm hereby deputizing you two to help us drink all of the wine in the cellar. Oh, I don't know. I've never drank wine before. I'm not sure I could do it right. That's crazy! Come here, I'll show you! Now, this wine... Drinking it, uh... Is really easy, Just, uh... do... like... this. Wha! Hold on, hold on, there's more, there's more. Now, you try. Do like this? You got it! Oh... I think I like wine. You think you're looking so good. And I'm thinking you're right. 'Cause when we're together, I get bothered and hot! I'm like a fire burning straight through the night! You know I'm different with you the pedal's heavier when I drive I feel you take me over and I lose control and I finally feel like I am alive! I can do anything! 'Cause you make me whole!

I don't know. Let's go on an adventure. The ground below me shook as I tried to stand my ground building the strength to face what was coming. But I was caught in a vice. That I could not escape... I felt myself change wondering what I was becoming. The beast emerged from the wood terrible and tall his prerogative: killling everything he sees his breath was heavy, his eyes were black and he wore an evil frown. As bad as he was, the beast was inside of me When I was a young boy, I was the sweetest little guy. I would help anyone who called my name but on my 10th birthday, the dark side found me and it changed me and I'd never be the same. Now I am the Beast and the Beast is me. We are one in the same, standing in the far off scourge And I look around at the scattered bodies of friends and lovers lost. Nothing can stop me, not even St. George. Ho ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho. Ho. Yeah. Give me a phone. I'll take a phone. Kubble's a land owner now! My farm. I'll make the corn grow all right. I earned this corn with every drop of dripping I had! Kubble's corn. Oh... Yep. Looking good. Oh, Kubble's looking pretty good now ain't she, boys? Brekkek! Coming mother. Not corn again! I'm afraid so. Spit on it. It's gross! You're starting to look pretty tasty yourself. You wouldn't want to eat... me. I'm hungry! Ricketts. Oh. Huh. Go on, get the husk and bones. Momma's gonna see herself a show. Bones of corn and corns of feet... feet of refuse are gross to eat. Nasty spirits I entreat Show me them girls who's indiscreet So, he takes me into the barn, right? And it's like a freakin Zoo, there's cows and horses, and pigs. And here's the weird part: there's goats on top of everything they're standing on the hay they're on the little farming machines There's goats ontop of the cows! Oh crabs. They're just talking. Don't you women ever work? Why are they on things like, they don't know about the ground? So then he gets his eyeballs open, real wide, right? And he says to me, “ain't only the goats that gots things they wanna be on top” Gross. Can you believe it? Mmmm... meh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. So I says to him, “Rudy You're no goat, you're a pig.” But that didn't stop him. He says, that's right, he's a pig and he wants to go Hog Wild, he says. The nerve! After we, you know, take care of business and he's all sprawled out on the hay there, drifting off. I say to him, “Rudy. You can't sleep in the barn like an animal. “Rudy. You can't sleep in the barn like an animal. It's disgusting.” it's disgusting.” He says to me, it's his barn, he'll sleep where he likes. So I say, “Fine, Rudy, you want to sleep like an animal? You can live like an animal.” And I go out and I lock him in there! Rudy may have been a louse but he was a louse with a habit and plenty of money. Ah, he's fine! Ah, he's fine! What we need is a girls' night out. What we need is a girls' night out. Hey, hey, that's a great idea. WHAT? Girls' night out?? What do you wanna do? Without my Kubble?? We could go to Penelope's joint. They've got a live band there. Brekkek! Go bring the girls here. Think they can go out without me, do they? We'll show 'em. We'll show 'em real good time.
