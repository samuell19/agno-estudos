Listen to me. I have something to tell you. It wasn't long ago, I was just like you. Thought I could, uh, run away from... from my nightmares, also. If only there was a place I could run to that they wouldn't follow me. I hate to tell you this. No such place exists. Wherever I went, there they were. But don't be afraid, because I found peace. Everything comes to an end, they say. They also say, life just goes on. At some point, you just have to accept your nightmares, and know they're... they're part of you, like family, Like an old friend. So I've come to a place where I'm gonna walk alone with open arms, just like an old friend. What's their name? It's no friend. To Marie Aldrich, please come at once. Your mother's grave has been vandalized. As her only living relative, it is up to you to decide how to proceed. Of course, this is very pressing, and discretion is of the highest priority. Sincerely, H. Grierson, Caretaker, Lone Palm Cemetery. Look. Closed till spring. What? Bridge goes up at dawn. The island's closed till spring. I'm not letting anybody new in. Just gonna be locals only. - That can't be. - What do you mean? No one can get over there? Our last tourists, they left on Tuesday. Kinda just easier that way. Sir, you don't understand, we're not tourist. How do you close an entire island? It's just till spring. Look. I got this letter just yesterday. This is an emergency. I have to get to the cemetery as soon as possible. Please. We better not waste any time. You okay? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. Did you know that? Whole island closes. Of course I didn't know that. What was the plan if we got in tomorrow, and the bridge was already locked? I don't know, George. I guess we'd have to find a boat. You stay here, okay? I'll go find him. George? Hey! George? Don't be frightened, dear. It's only me. My, my. Hello. I'm trying to find the caretaker. My mother's grave was destroyed. Do you know where I can find him? You look like an angel, a frightened angel like before. What do you mean? I saw you at the funeral from a distance. They call me Miss Emily. I own the flower shop on Main Street, and I help care for these graves. Did you know her? My dear, didn't she... Are you all right? The caretaker, have you seen him? I'm sorry. I must be going. A storm's coming. I saw someone walking amongst the tombstones over there. Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Did you find him? Come back here! George! George! Hey! Hey! Hello? Hello? George? Hey! Where were you? - Where were you? - I was looking for you. You didn't hear me? Did you see them? Who? The people there? What? No. What people? You didn't go in the woods? I was back there. Are you okay? You couldn't find the guy? No, I went to the office, and I don't know. I mean, I think we need to get across the bridge before it closes. I can't leave her grave like that. Well, I mean, it's possible we missed the guy. Why would he say to get here immediately if he wasn't gonna be here? I don't know, you know? But there's a restaurant we passed a couple miles back. I mean, we could go ask? Yeah. What is up with you? I don't know. Let's go. Excuse us. Um, we're trying to find the cemetery caretaker. Haskel? Sorry? Haskel? He told us to come. It's urgent. Both of you? It's quite urgent. Is there a number where we could reach him? Some kind of direct line? Lines go down pretty fast on account of the storms. Listen, we need to get across the bridge before it closes, so is there any help anyone could provide? It would be greatly appreciated. Sure, come on. I'll try him on the radio. This way. Wait here. I'll be back. Well, now, it looks like you sure could use a drink. No, thank you. You know, it's a damn shame what happened. This island ain't very big. Everybody knows everything. Do you know who did it? - Didn't anybody tell... - Henry! Okay, all right. Caught me. I'm the last man out this year. What does that mean? Well, that means if you find yourself here longer than you expect, why don't you come pay me a visit? My house is just down the road there, number 24. I'll be up real late, later than everybody else. I'll leave the light on just in case. Key under the mat. I got my own boat. I'll be a real friend to you. Yeah? You're gonna be my friend? I could be. Tell me who did it. Well, you ain't too good at listenin', now are you? - Now I've tried... - All right now, come on. - Come on, come on. - All right, all right. Your hands off me. Everything okay? Oh, everything is fine, Mr. Wonderful. Peachy fucking keen. We didn't reach him. Does anyone know where we can find the caretaker? Did you check the cemetery? Let's go. What did he say to you? Had you met that guy? No. Why did he act like he knew you? This caretaker guy better be dead. Something's wrong here. Something's really wrong. Well, what do you want to do? She didn't want to come back here. What? She didn't want to be buried here. She tried to tell me. She was right, there's something wrong with this place. She didn't want to come back here. Hey! Hey, talk to me! - It's crazy. - Nothing is too... Would you just spit it out? What the fuck is happening right now? I think someone changed her will. In those last days, her mind was completely gone. She was a total stranger. But one day I woke up, and she was back, just like that, like she never left. I'd been by her side every day, but I hadn't seen her lucid like that in a long time. We talked about everything, like old friends, if you can believe that. But then... everything changed. She begged me not to let them bury her here. When I asked why, you know what she told me? She said, that the people on this island made a deal with a demon. She told me that, a long time ago, the early settlers couldn't survive the storms, and everyone was dying. Whole families were wiped out. Until one day, when a man crawled out of the ocean and offered them a deal. She said, her family, our family, was part of this pact. I know. I know how this sounds. I was angry with myself for believing even for a second that she was back, that it was her again. But then suddenly it says in her will that she wants to be buried here? And then her grave gets all smashed. And then they call me down here right before they're about to lock the bridge? What if this is some kind of trap? Jesus. George, what if this is some kind of trap? I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. I can't believe I just told you that. I can't believe I just told you that. What? - Hey! - What? Well, are you gonna say anything? What would you like me to say? I spent two days in a car with you, and you don't say shit, and, suddenly, tonight, you're laying demons and sea creatures on me. - I mean, what the fuck? - How do you tell someone that? Why didn't you tell me any of this? How do you tell someone that? When it was actually happening, I didn't think you were ever gonna talk to me again anyway. I thought maybe we could just start over? - You could've called me? - I did. Not now, then. You didn't have to deal with that alone. - Yeah, what were you gonna do? - Sitting in room a with her, listening to this nonsense day after day, over and over. I shouldn't have dragged you into this. I'm sorry. I mean, just to be clear, her mind was gone. You know? You know how crazy that shit sounds, right? Yeah. I just... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Me too. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I mean it. - I know. Can we please get the fuck out of here? Yes. When we get back to New York, I'm not sure what you've been dealing with in terms of logistics and paperwork, but if you need help with anything, you know, you should feel free to ask. Thanks. Uh... I'm gonna sell her house on Block Island, but maybe we could spend the weekend there before I put it on the market. Yeah. Really? Yeah, that sounds great. Jesus. Hold on. What the... - This is the way we came? - It has to be. You didn't make any other turns? There's been one road we've been on the entire time. Well, turn around! We got to get out of here. No! What the fuck is going on? - There, there! There! - No, we did not come from that way! - There's nowhere else to go. - Jesus! No, no, no, no! What is happening right now? Watch out! The Weather Service Forecast for New York City. 11:00 a.m., Central Broadway. Price and Price, please hold. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know, but the secretary's not in today, okay? Give me one second, please. Price and Price. Hey. I'm like literally drowning here because the girl who's supposed to be here just got back from like a trip from France or something, and we were in the conference room, and she was talking, and then she got sick. I want you to know that my life truly has been a dream, and I want to thank each and... One second. Ms. Aldrich? Yeah, they're ready for you. Ms. Aldrich, we understand that you're upset. I'm not upset. I'm telling you what she said. She didn't want this. In fact, she begged me not to let it happen. I've got a copy of her will right here. I know what the will says. I'm telling you that it's wrong. She never visited the place. She never talked about it my whole life. She never mentioned it. This doesn't make any sense. Be that as it may, we can't just take - the word of her daughter. - It's not my word! Especially when it's written into the will. That's the law. Plus, we have to consider the press. - The press? - They'll say Ava Aldrich's problem child is trying to change her will. Everybody will assume it's about inheritance. We sympathize with you. We truly do, but we don't want this to become more complicated than it already is. We're thinking of you here. - That's right. - I don't give a shit what anybody says about me. I'm not some problem child. - We never... - She begged me right until the very end, even when she was in and out of consciousness, even when she couldn't form a single fucking sentence, over and over, she kept repeating, "Don't take me back there." Ms. Aldrich. The law is the law. - It's quite beautiful, you know? - What is? The island. You'll see. Price and Price. I'm sorry, please hold. Price and Price. George? George? No! Help! Anybody? Hello?! Hello? I need help! Hello? Thank you for calling your We are closed for the season and re-open the first day in spring. Please leave a detailed message. See you next season. Thank you. Goodbye. Hello? Hello? First there was nothing, Have you angered God? Have you angered God? Come on. Fuck! You know you're not supposed to smoke. His darling girl always talking back. What's a mother supposed to do? You know, sometimes, I wish they'd stay a certain age. It's just you and me, Ma. No one's watching. Don't talk to me like that. And don't call me, Ma. "Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma." Grow up! Okay. You don't need to do that. And talkin' to me like I'm some kinda asshole. Don't you know what I've done for you? Did you not hear the story I told you? I heard you. Did you hear anything I said? I heard you. Did you read it in a story or something? One of the screenplays they send you? - Don't talk to me like that. - Were you acting? - No. - You were telling me the truth? - You were never grateful. - Were are you acting? - Never were. - Were you acting? I'm not! Tell me the truth. - Are you acting? - You were telling me the truth? - Are you acting? - Ma, please, stop. Are you acting, or are you telling me the truth? Calm down! Can you be straight with me for once? - Are you acting. - For once! Or are you telling me the truth? - Ma! Stop! Stop! - Please! Tell me! Is the story real or not? I have never acted around you. - Ma, please... - Don't call me ma! They call me Ms. Emily. I own the flower shop on Main Street. Ms. Emily? There's been an accident. I need help. Are you here? Hello? Hello? Are you there? Ms. Emily? Thank God. There's been an accident. I need to call for help. Where is everyone? Did you hear me? Ms. Emily? Hey! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?! Shhh. Come on. Come on. What other choice you got? You never should have come back here. Have you seen the man that I was with? Nope. But if he ain't dead, you better hope they ain't found him either. Shh. What's wrong with these people? Ain't nothin' wrong with these people. They're just cursed is all. Whole damn island's cursed. The place is evil. He trapped us all here a long time ago. That's why they brought your mother back. She's got a contract to fulfill, a debt to pay to him. A man from the sea? Did she tell you about him? She tried to... at the end. Then why the hell did you come back here? Because it sounded too insane to be true. Aah. Where are we going? Listen, the tourist season brings the sunshine, right? Sunshine brings people. People have all this energy, and also, we harvest that energy, and then when everybody leaves, well, that's when he feeds. "Feeds"... What does that mean? Take a look down, darlin'. You've been standin' on 'em since you got here. He just sucks it out of 'em, you know? Leaves 'em all dried up, desiccated, like a mummy in a museum, a statue or something, till someone comes along and disturbs 'em. Then what the fuck are you? I'm the same as the rest of 'em! But every year, somebody's gotta stay awake. This year, I made sure it was me. Why? Oh, my God. You don't... Oh, you don't recognize me at all, do you? No. Just tell me who you are. God, man. She didn't say one word about me. No matter anyway. That's my house over there. I'll get you to the boat and get you to the mainland. I can't leave here without him. Ready? Come on, let's go! Listen to me. The keys to my boat, they're in a chest of drawers in the second room over there. - Did they follow us? - I don't know. Go get the keys! Go get the keys! Alright. Okay. Let's go! Let's go! - We're going to the boat! - Hang on a second! Wait, wait! - No, we're not waiting. - Listen to me. We're only gonna get one shot at this, alright? Now, I'm the driver of the damn boat. Do you know how to drive a boat? No. Shh. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - No, let's get outta here. Wait, wait, wait. What? No, no, no, no. Listen, you keep your eye on that door, okay? - I'm gonna go ups there... - No, don't go up there! Just listen to me, alright? Keep your eye on the door. And don't come up here until I tell ya. It's my goddamn house. My goddamn boat. What's up there? Hey! Hey! Answer me! What was that? Hey! Hey! Where are you? Oh. Answer me! Jesus Christ. Hey! Answer me! Hello? Is anybody there? I need help. Come on. Come on, come on, come on! Hello? Anybody? Come on. Hello? - Marie? - George? George, where are you? At the bridge. George, I can't hear you. Talk to me. Where are you? I can't hear you. The bridge. Where are you? Bridge. To the bridge, hurry. Okay, stay there! I'm coming! No! George? There you are. I thought I lost you. Where were you? What happened to you? I was scared, too, but it's okay. What do you mean, it's okay? It's good. What are you talking about? This place is good. I promise it's good. Who are you? Who am I? How could you ask me that? He was a good person. He didn't do anything wrong! Why did you do this to him? To show you. He begged for salvation. I am salvation. What are you? This place... people here are my fingers. Island is the palm of my hand. In life, they have free will, but in death, they belong to me. You belong to me. What about my mother? What are you gonna do to her? Fate worse than hell. Don't be scared, my child. You belong to me. Uh... The causeway drawbridge... Come on. Operating the bridge is as easy as driving a car, boat, or commercial truck. To lower the bridge... Yes. Come on. Oh, wait. Can't let you go, miss. No! No. I know who you are. Knew since the moment I saw you. Your mother did terrible things. He wants you to see what happens. She didn't do anything wrong! She left! She turned her back on this place. I've been waiting my whole life, serving them, protecting them, making sure nobody came in when they weren't supposed to. I worked so fucking hard for salvation, salvation that she was born with, and she just goes and throws it away. I mean... how can somebody just leave heaven? You don't know what you're doing. I don't? I don't? I don't fucking know what I'm doing? I need you to listen to me. That place isn't heaven. Don't say that. It's true. Stop. That place is hell. Stop it, I've seen what they become. They're trapped. I'm sorry, but you were tricked. They've all been tricked! I promise you. Just let me go! I said, stop! Stop! I can kill you, and yous just gonna come right back like the rest of them... 'cause you're one of 'em. Everybody knows it. I can pay you. Name your price. Have you heard one goddamn thing that I've said? Have you been listenin'? 'Cause I don't want any money. I don't want no fucking money! I just want life. I just want life after death. Fuck you! Fuck me?! Fuck me?! Fuck me?! Well, you're gonna come with me. Or I'm gonna shoot you, and it's gonna hurt. But you're gonna come back real quick, 'cause it's that time of the year. So you're gonna come back real quick. Eternal life. Eternal salvation. He's waiting. I hate to say it, missy, but... your mom made some good movies. Don't go thinkin' about runnin' or nothin', 'cause I'm a pretty good shot for an old man. You're a lucky girl. You know that? I'd trade places with you any day. Go on. I'm not allowed any further. Not yet anyway. Is this really what you want? More than anything. Then, go on. Ma? Ma? This is a nightmare. Are you my old friend? Wait! I'm sorry! She said that the people on this island made a deal with a demon. I see. I see now. She told me that... a long time ago, the early settlers couldn't survive the storms, until, one day, when a man crawled out of the ocean... and offered them a deal. He offered them a deal. The entire island is the palm of my hand. The island is the palm of my hand. Did you fall asleep? Just for a second. How are you? Good. You? Good. I ever tell you I had a brother? You had a brother? Yeah. He was older than me. What happened? Oh, they never told me what happened. They thought I was too little to know. Of course, I overheard conversations, and I pieced things together. He drowned. He was a good swimmer, too, but he drowned. I loved him more than anything in the whole world, and he was gone just like that. But one day, after the funeral, it was late at night, I was in my room, and I heard something outside my window, and I looked, and there he was. So I followed him. I followed him into the woods. And he turned. And he looked at me. And I knew it wasn't him. I knew it wasn't him, and we had made a deal to go together, but that wasn't him. So I ran. I was frightened. I ran as fast as I could. I ran, and I never looked back, and don't... don't ever take me back there. Don't you ever let anybody take me back there, my ashes, my bones, my nothin'. Okay. Promise. I promise. Hello? Just a minute. Oh, hello. Hi. You two must be the last ones here. Bridge goes up tomorrow. We can't seem to bring ourselves to leave. You mean they actually lock people out of this place? Just until spring. What can I do for you? We were hoping to stop here one last time. You have got the most beautiful flowers, if you have any left. Oh, thank you. My grandmother will be thrilled to hear that. ] We wanna take some home with us, you know, for memories. Of course. On me. Really? Thank you so much. You're welcome. We love this town, don't we, darling? Uh-huh. That's right. Well, you can always come back. I wish we could stay here all year round. Don't be silly. Nobody does that. Well... thank you again. See you next season.
