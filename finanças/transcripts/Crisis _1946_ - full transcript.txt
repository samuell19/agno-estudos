DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2016 CRISIS This is such a small town. With its feet in the river, it slumbers softly amid the greenery. There's no train station to mar the reflective calm of this idyll. Neither industries nor shipping hasten the steady pace of the day or the still peace of the night. The big event of the day is the arrival of the bus. It brings newspapers, mail, and unfamiliar faces in which one can discern traces of a hurried, worrisome life. Today a wholly unfamiliar lady steps off the bus. Everything about her is alien and a bit shocking. Dress, face, nails, hat, eyes... everything about her speaks of the great wide world. Yet well-informed parties can easily guess what and whom the lady has come about. It is Mrs. Jenny, who after 18 years has come for her daughter Nelly, who has grown up in the care of Miss Ingeborg Johnson. Many agree with Uncle Edward, Ingeborg's family doctor, who says... "This will be a terrible blow to Ingeborg." Miss Ingeborg is a piano teacher and rents a room to a young veterinarian named Ulf, whom she usually calls "Uffe." Let the play begin. I wouldn't call this a great or harrowing tale. It really is just an everyday drama. Almost a comedy. Let's raise the curtain. Play with your fingers, not your elbows. One, two, three, four... I say, Malin, do you call that beating cushions? It's not that important, is it? No, it isn't. Kalle, one never becomes a good piano player if one's soul isn't in it. Heaven knows you put no soul into your playing. Be glad that Beethoven is deaf. Malin, polish the kettle too. Polish the kettle too? Never mind. You work too hard before you come here. - It's because I charge so little. - Come now! Small pay is still pay, my dear girl! Let's take a break. Have a piece of candy. You have one too. Wipe your fingers on your hanky, if you have one. Nelly, are you home already? Mutti, I'm in a dreadful hurry. I have a package to pick up. Then I'm meeting Uffe. He said he wanted to talk to me. Are you looking forward to tonight? I'm so happy my stomach aches. Dear child. There's Auntie Jessie. She'll have to entertain you instead. Hello, Auntie Jessie. Well, I never! Hello, dear Jessie! Ingeborg, I... Your hair looks beautiful! What's so special about it? I don't know. The color makes you look younger. It does, doesn't it? Are you looking to borrow money again? Must it always be money? You owe me a lot... 73 kronor and 50 öre. Do any shoes need polishing? Don't worry. Then I'm done. - What do I owe you? - 2.25. I have no money today. Can you lend me five kronor? I really need it. You and that lovely purse of yours. I've never seen a prettier purse. - I have two kronor in my hanky. - I need five. - My mother used to say... - Let your mother rest in peace. What are you looking for? - I only have 10. That'll do just fine. Oh, Ingeborg! Jessie! You have to lend me 60 kronor. Have you gone mad? For what? You can go now, Kalle. Will you lend me the money or not? I can give you 30. That's all I have. Bless you. I knew you'd only give me half, so I asked for twice as much. There's a lady here to see you. Probably some student's mother. Jessie, could you go to Anderson's and pick up a dress for me? For Nelly? Yes, for Nelly. Hurry now. Hello. So it's you. Welcome. - What's in the package? - A surprise. A surprise? Can't you tell me what it is? Curiosity grows with age. It will be a surprise for you and Mutti. Tell me where it came from. It came on the bus, if you really must know, nosy man. I say, Nelly... you're terribly fond of dancing. The only thing on your mind is that silly ball tonight. I intend to make a big splash. Nelly... would you consider going with me? What? Won't you go with me? Dear, sweet Uffe! Do you think I want to go with an old man? Is that so inconceivable? What? - Don't you see? - Are you going to propose again? Don't you see why I came back and took a room at Miss Ingeborg's? Can I go now? All you think of is that stupid ball. I mean nothing to you. - Silly! I love my little Mutti, and I'm very fond of you too, like I'm fond of the piano and the old chest of drawers... but that's all. I can't stay here all my life. I want to experience other things. Do you really know what you want? One must have dreams. You mustn't let that upset you. You're not upset, are you? Oh, no! I forgot to buy hairpins! Tell Mutti I'll be home soon. Bye, old man. Hello. After all, the girl is mine, not yours. You suddenly show up claiming Nelly for your own. It's beyond me. I don't know what to say. Is there some reason you want her now? I'm her mother. Isn't that enough? It just dawned on you now, after 18 years? My life hasn't exactly been a bed of roses. She's probably had a more peaceful life with you. But I'm a bit better off now. Congratulations! Not many people can say that these days. And is there a more peaceful place for a child than with her mother? Her real mother. Not just someone who gave birth to her! Do you really want us to be enemies, Miss Johnson? How could we be enemies when it comes to Nelly's welfare? It would be best for Nelly to be with me. I think she's better off here. She has everything she needs, and someone who cares for her. She'd have better work at better pay, and she'd meet people her own age. And she'd be with her mother, Miss Johnson. Who's neglected her for 18 years. I really don't believe you can defend your position. We'll let her choose. She'll do as we tell her. Let me tell you something, but you mustn't tell Nelly or anyone else. I'm ill. Nelly is everything to me. I feel my life's been worthwhile because she's needed me. Couldn't you let me keep her a while longer, just until... Just until... Then you can take her. You have your whole life. Couldn't you please just go home and leave things as they are? So it's not for Nelly's sake that you want to keep her. It's for your own. Not just mine. Nelly feels at home here. She's happy. Don't take her. I couldn't bear it. Take her? So you admit she might not want to stay? And you'll bear up just fine. I've suffered too, and I got through it. This is just a whim to you. Kindly choose your words more carefully! Now, then... we should let her decide. We can talk tomorrow. Forgive me if I've hurt your feelings. Nelly and I are greatly indebted to you. I do lose my temper easily. Forgive me. Do you need a pill? You don't look so well. No? Good-bye, then. Come in. Come in! What the blazes! Is that you, Jack? What on earth are you doing here? You're mad! What are you doing here? I was bored and followed you here to make sure you weren't cheating on me. A gown for a ball? Fancy clothes. You had your hair done. A ball at the hotel, is there? I'm not disturbing you? - Silly! I'm glad you're here. Pretty boy, eh? - Sweet. - Yes. Jenny... come here right now. Certainly. Of course, darling. Now tell me what shady business brings you to this dump. Is little Jack jealous? No. Just annoyed. You left me alone and broke in the city on a Saturday night. Tell me everything... or I'll cut your throat and stick you in a trunk. Well? What's it going to be? I have a daughter here, if you really must know. What's that, you old sinner? You have a daughter? Grown-up? - Eighteen. Jenny has an 18-year-old daughter. Jenny has a daughter who's 18 years old. For the first time in two years, you intrigue me. Interesting. Very interesting. Nelly's going to a ball to have a good time, and you go and propose before she's had her fun. Nitwit! - I'll dance every dance with her. - Put her on a leash, will you? Men just aren't very smart. You were to win her over tonight. She'd see you next to the others. How dashing and wonderful you are. I've never been wonderful. A man proposing in the moonlight is always wonderful. Never propose in the daylight. Isn't it lovely? Not bad at all. Nelly, would you come here? We have a surprise for you. I'll be right there! I have a surprise too. Hold it up so she'll see it right off. That's it. We took care of that too. The Lord and I always have a bright idea at the last minute. What's that you're wearing, dear child? Mutti... did you buy me a dress too? It's just a simple rag. I did promise you one. It's so pretty. Where did you get that one? Aunt Jenny sent it. I wrote her that I was going to a ball. Isn't it lovely? Aunt Jenny is in town. She wants to meet you tomorrow. Aunt Jenny's coming here? What does she want? - We'll talk about that tomorrow. Don't think she hasn't come prepared. Ladies and gentlemen! In times like ours... so full of pain and suffering and famine... we, with all our wealth, should make it our duty to help relieve the suffering of others wherever possible. This evening's festivities, initiated by yours truly, form part of this campaign. I hereby declare this evening's ball open, and I hope you'll all enjoy yourselves... insofar as anyone can enjoy themselves. And with that I bid the orchestra to strike up "The Blue Danube." - I don't waltz very well. - No. - Did you say something? - No, nothing. - I thought you said something. - No, nothing. Why? I just thought you said something. There! With the tall fellow? How can you be sure? I bought that dress for her. Isn't she beautiful? I suppose. Can't they play something besides a waltz? The mayor loves to dance, but he only knows the waltz. May I? I believe you're a bit tipsy! That makes two of us! Waltzing has everyone else bored silly, but we're having fun! - Are we? - Of course! You sound bitter all of a sudden. Would you mind if I asked your daughter to dance? Not at all. You can do as you like. May I? You're very beautiful. The belle of the ball. That's very kind of you. Feminine beauty makes me sad. I'm so happy to have met you. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of each other. You look so sad. - Me? I'm not sad at all. Not sad in the usual way. It's a sadness deep in your eyes. Perhaps your heart is sad. You sound like a novel. I was going to enter the church. Are you from town? - I live here. - Lucky you. - Why? To live in peace, far from the noise and worry. It can be a bit too peaceful. That's what you say. I'm Jack. What's your name? First names so quickly? Couldn't we be good friends and tell each other everything? Look at him. Hello there! We have to make a toast. A glass, please. There you are. You too, my friend. One more, please. Please hold this for a moment. You have to taste this brew, dear girl. It's my own concoction. I call it "Jack the Ripper's Evensong." It'll go down easily. I'm sure you'll like it. Ladies and gentlemen! In view of the lateness of the hour, we'll enjoy some entertainment as we rest our feet a while. Jack the Ripper's Evensong, the very last drop! Amen! Stop it! Stop it, I said! - Shall we dance, Mayor? - What the...! Did she kiss my husband? Jack! What a bunch of crazy marionettes! And who pulled their strings? Me! Come on! Have you seen Ulf? The tall fellow? "What love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me!" He'd kill you! "There lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet, and I am proof against their enmity. My life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued, wanting of thy love." You're so funny. You're not like other people. You're right. Can't you hear the engine whirring? That's my clockwork. You wind me up with a key. Who winds you up? You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Poor man. Don't pity me. One day I'll leave the puppet theater and enter the darkness. The spring will break, everything will fall apart, and people will say... "That Jack! Whatever became of him?" Aren't you ever cheerful? How do you mean? Happy. You know. I'm happy right now, Nelly. May I kiss you, Nelly? Once I lived under some stairs in an old castle in ruins. Across from the stairs was a big broken window. Through it I could see the fields beneath the moon, the sea, the woods, and two bone meal factories. In those days I was happy. Now I'm all right... but I'm not happy. A dragon stands guard over me. It gives me everything I need in exchange for just a few pounds of my body and a few ounces of my brain every week. You're so very strange! But it won't be that way any longer. May I kiss you again? This is a moonlit life. Not yet for you, but you'll soon see. Unreal light, darkness, and shadows, and all manner of frightful things. You little bastard! Leave me alone! Don't hit me! Ulf, don't! What's wrong with you? Leave me alone! Why are you following me? Stop it! What are you doing? Murderer! - This is a fine mess! - Stop holding me like that! What a fine cavalier! I did that for Miss Ingeborg's sake. You had no right! You wanted to make a splash tonight! Well, you certainly did! Let me explain! Why should I? You go to a ball and behave like a... You don't understand! I was so excited about the ball. This dress made me want to sing! You certainly didn't suppress that desire. - I didn't sing that much. - Drunks forget easily. I didn't sing in the hall, and I wasn't drunk! You were blind drunk! Ulf! Blubber away, if you think it's any use! I'm not saying it's your fault, but you always say, "Follow your heart's desire." Me and my big mouth. What else? - Nothing else, really. Oh, yes. The mayor came rushing in... and I threw my arms around his neck. I didn't know what I was doing. And Uffe just stood there gaping. What should the poor boy have done? Oh, Mutti! It's so good to be back with you again. I feel as if I've been on a long journey. Then it's good you're back home again. I want to stay with you always. I never want to leave. I won't let you go, my child. You can rest assured. I won't let you go. You're all I have. No one else means anything to me. I'm so happy now. You have no idea how happy you've made me. When the town awoke that Sunday morning, a new incident had been added to the records. Kettles were boiling in the little houses. Something awful had happened at the ball. Something involving strangers and a wild, licentious dance. And something had happened to Miss Johnson's Nelly. Something shocking and inexplicable. It certainly wouldn't be fitting for Nelly to stay in town after such a scandal. What did you hear, Malin? Miss Nelly played the trumpet at the ball! Isn't that something, when she's never studied the trumpet? I've never heard her play the trumpet. It wasn't the trumpet. Was it the organ? Hello. Hello! Weren't you expecting me? Yes. I waited until Miss Johnson left. I so wanted to see you alone. Mutti's playing at a funeral and... You seem so anxious, dear child. You're a big girl now, Nelly. Have you nothing to say to me? It feels so strange. You may not believe it, but I think of you often. I've thought of you too, Auntie. Auntie. You think you might call me "Mother"? Perhaps... Well, let's settle for "Auntie" for the time being. I wasn't much older than you are now when I had you. I know you've been through a lot for my sake. Well, we all have our crosses to bear. I own a beauty salon, and it's very interesting work. Would you like to come learn it? Surely you don't mean to stay here forever. You're not engaged, are you? It wouldn't be so strange at your age, my dear girl. You'll make good wages so you can buy nice clothes. And you'll get away from here. You can come see Mutti on your vacation, and she can come visit. Pardon me. - I'd love to go with you! - So we're agreed. As soon as possible! We could leave tonight. Yes, let's leave this very night if possible. Nelly has decided to come with me. I hope you'll let her go without harsh words. I don't use harsh words without good reason. I hope we can meet again on good terms. I think you should go now. We'll talk of good terms another time. Auntie has promised me a vacation. You'll have to earn it first. When are you leaving? - Tonight, if possible. Are you leaving? I have to pack your things. - You're on this train too? - Funny, isn't it? - You might say that. - Allow me to introduce you. Jack, my half brother's son. My daughter Nelly. No reason not to use first names. - I'm part of the family. I've been a mother to him since his parents died. They died? Oh, right... typhoid fever in London. They came on a banana boat from Antananarivo. Haven't we met? - Have you? How nice. - Her face looks very familiar. You look a bit wrinkled. I soaked in the tub all night. That can easily lead to wrinkling! What a long tunnel! The sensational and embarrassing incident was gradually forgotten... and the summer went by. Miss Ingeborg Johnson looked the same as she walked to the chapel or her piano lessons. Perhaps a bit older, a bit more solitary. Ulf gave up his room and left town. Malin, the cleaning lady, suddenly added a pair of healthy twins to the town's population. The father disappeared with her savings. She herself was very happy. The man got the money and the fun. Malin got the kids and the disgrace. That's what happens to wicked people. Remember that. I'd rather not, thank you. Give me a fiver for wool. I'm knitting for the twins. I will not! People owe me enough as it is. You'll get your 20 kronor. - Twenty-five! - Fine, 25. Just testing your memory. I wish I could figure you out. I was engaged to your brother. I've known you nearly my whole life. Harald was lucky to die so young. Ingeborg! I worry about you. Why can't you be serious? You look so pale and thin. Any news from Nelly? Yes... I received a wonderful letter this morning. Quite long... six pages. They've expanded the salon again. - Is she still getting out and about? - Oh, yes. She went to a dinner party Tuesday night. - A Tuesday night? - Yes, a Tuesday. They have such a large circle of friends. She likes her work and meets lots of people. She should have left here a long time ago. I should have... What's wrong? Just feeling under the weather. Ingeborg, what's wrong? Edward... we're both sensible people. What's going to happen to me? Sit down and stop fussing. We're old friends. Can't we speak frankly? Yes, of course. So? This thing could be operated on, and recovery should follow. Are you sure an operation would help? I'll be perfectly honest with you. This is a serious matter. It's a complicated operation that might only put things off a few years longer. And without the operation? It will be a few years. Perhaps longer, perhaps shorter. It's hard to say. Now you know how matters stand. I'm very grateful. May I ask you something else? Could I be up and about? - Absolutely. You'll be moving about freely up to a few months before. And the seizures? You'll get medicine for those. It's just as it should be. It serves me right. Mutti! Mutti! Good Lord! You scared me! Jessie. Jessie, should I go see Nelly? What's gotten into you? You've never asked for my advice. Sometimes a person needs her friends. Aren't you my friend? You know I am. Well, should I go see her? You should do what you want. - I can't go. - Why not? I have no money. I'll lend you some, of course. You're so kind. When I get back, we'll sit and knit in the evenings. We'll light a fire in the autumn chill. Ingeborg! I can't bear it any longer! Thank you, Jessie. Will you help me? I'll leave today. He ran around in midwinter with his hat tipped back, his hair dyed, and his coat open, trying to look 20. I thought he was 38. Later, when we became more intimate, I realized he was 60. Like Catherine the Great, I say, "When you've had 10,000 men... you realize there's no great difference between them." May I help you, ma'am? Do you have an appointment? Nelly, come here! Miss Johnson! Welcome! What a pleasant surprise. Nelly will be so happy. - I hope I'm not disturbing you. - Not at all. I just got it into my head to come. A splendid idea! Nelly isn't home, but she'll be here any minute. She'll be so happy to see you. Would you like to see her room? Yes, please. Be my guest. Nelly seems to like it here. She's often out enjoying herself. She's made lots of friends. Everyone likes her. That's nice. She has written, hasn't she? I tell her often to write you. That's very kind of you. But perhaps it's hard to find the time. What do you think of her room? It's very nice. This is her closet. I had a few things made for her. Look at this. A dress for a princess. Feel this silk! A dress for a princess... And look at her little shoes. She has such tiny feet. And she has new undergarments too. It's so nice to give her beautiful things. They look so good on her and make her so happy. Shall we sit down? Here's her diary. You read her diary? No, I just leaf through it. It's so amusing. Listen to this, for example: "I watched Mother get dressed this morning. She looked so young standing naked before the mirror. Her skin looks younger than mine. Mine looks so gray." Isn't that cute? I don't want to hear any more. No? Then I won't read any more. I never read her diary once in 18 years. That's you, Miss Johnson. But then you're such a decent, upright woman. How are you, by the way? You look pale. Just fine, thank you. Any news from the province? Oh, yes. I bought a geranium. This is wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! My dear little girl! I've missed you so much. You're older and more beautiful. Much more beautiful. - You're embarrassing me. And your hair. Back home you had no hairstyle at all really. I had a feeling you were coming. Did you leave this morning? Did Aunt Jessie see you off? How is she? Is her hair still the same color? Nothing happens back home. We're the same as always. But you should have lots to tell. My job is lots of fun. I'm always meeting fun people... and some odd ones. Some are so odd that I... But Jenny is so nice to me, always giving me things and spoiling me. I think she was very lonely before, before the salon got so busy. Have you run into Ulf? No. Is he here in town? I didn't know. Good old Uffe. He moved out when you left. Did he? I see. Sorry to hear that. I mean... who do you rent to now? The room is waiting for him to return. Mutti! Nelly, what is it you're trying to tell me that's so hard to say? What is it? Nothing. What could it be? Can't you see I'm just fine? That everything is fine? You're not telling me the truth. You must tell me what it is! Nothing's the matter, dearest Mutti. Dinner is served. Little Nelly. - I don't understand where Jack is. - He's never on time. My half brother's son. He's here a lot. He's an actor... but he hasn't worked in a long time. - He was to be on the radio last week. - You don't say. And he's getting a film part. - What happened to the radio job? - It was canceled. A film role would be nice... but it could be another of his inventions. Why do you say that? You said yourself he's a great talent. Are you sure it wasn't Jack who said that? You shouldn't talk about Jack in front of Mutti. Why get so worked up, Nelly? I do believe you're blushing. Jack's a nice boy, if a bit fanciful sometimes. He's an artist, but you don't understand that. If he gets that part, he could start paying his way. That's strange. You wouldn't accept his money before. Because I knew he had none. He only said he did. His "artistic imagination," if you like. Shall we? I should be going. I must get to the station. It's a pity I can't see you off. Will you come again soon? It may be a while. Thank you. I can manage. Then I'll have to come visit you. You're always welcome. You know that. Forgive me, but aren't you Miss Ingeborg? Yes. I'm Jack. I live at Jenny's... sometimes. Did you call on them? - Yes. But I'm catching the night train back. - May I see you to the station? - Don't go to any trouble. No trouble at all. Let's go. Here's your ticket... and one for the sleeping car, and a little candy. And a magazine. Thank you for all your help. Not at all. But you mustn't stay any longer. The longer it takes, the better. Don't you want to go to that party with Nelly? It's not that. I see. It wouldn't be indiscreet for you to ask. What should I ask? "Is that Jenny going to the party too?" And I'd say, "No, she's not." And everything is one great big muddle. Up until I met your little girl... I say "your" because she is yours, even if Jenny happened to give birth to her. Well, ever since then... I'm no longer a moonlit creature in a moonlit life. You understand? - Not really. It's not easy to understand. What I mean is... - You mean you're in love with Nelly? No. No, that's not it at all. I can't be in love with anyone. I only love myself. But Nelly is real somehow, if you know what I mean. Yes, I do. She's so real that I become even more unreal... and start wondering why I live my ghostly life at all. Perhaps I understand. I could do with her as my anchor in reality. For my own benefit, that is. It's a purely selfish point of view. There's a price to pay for that. Oh, yes. If you only take and never give... the penalty is severe. May I have a cigarette? Your words are a bit upsetting. With pleasure. I must say I admire you. - Me? You've given and given without a thought for yourself. Have I? Nelly's always talking about you. She loves you. She'll come back to you one day. Then you'll have your reward. And then Jenny and I will have to pay. Jenny lives off me. And I live off Nelly. It's all rather diabolic. But we must be content that we've had her on loan. And I'll tell you something else. Tonight I'm going to take off this striped suit... bundle it up in a package, and send it to Jenny. Ask me what I'll do after that. I'll put on my old rags. I'll leave Jenny and that whole world. I'll live under some stairs where the moon will shine in. I'll look out over a field, a bay... and two bone meal factories. Well, we'd best be going so you don't miss your train. Thank you for keeping me company. It was nothing. Take good care of Nelly. She looks to you. I don't know if she's in love with you. I'm so worried. Something's going to happen, but I don't know what. Attention, please. Passengers on the night express... please take your seats. Please close the doors. I'm going to sleep now. I'm very tired... I've been to see my grandchildren. You see, I'm not your real mother. The other kids told me that a long time ago. They did? I didn't want to tell you. It would have only made you sad. Is that so? I remember her confirmation. I sold my books so she could have a dress. You and I have always loved her. I only love myself. I could do with her as my anchor in reality. For my own benefit. So it's not for Nelly's sake that you want to keep her. It's for your own. Dear Lord, why is this happening to this old woman? I always thought I loved the girl for her own sake. Why else have I existed? Dear Lord, take these thoughts from me! I don't want them! I can't bear them! Help me! I don't want to die! Please, help me! I can't bear it! Calm down! It's probably something you ate. With me it's always a dream about a big black man biting my toes off... whatever that means. There, have a little water. Another sip. There we are. Goodness me. Keep the light on and you'll be able to sleep. Hello, Uffe. Welcome back. You wrote that the room was free. Will you be staying? I suppose I will. Well, how did you like it in the big city? Not much at all. I just walked around missing Nelly, so I thought I might as well do that here. Did she ever write you? No. Yes... a postcard. Did you go visit? Yes. - How was she? - I'm not sure, Uffe. I don't think she's happy. - Anything I can do? - No. How come? It's something everyone has to go through on their own. No one can help you through it. But what about after that? After that? Then it'll be good we're here. Please don't smoke in here. Jenny doesn't like it. - This place is fantastic. - Why? All these severed heads. What's that music? - It's from the theater next door. I'd like to come here when it's full of women. I'd look in their eyes and say, "Tell Jack everything." Why don't you say that to Jenny? Please don't mention her name. What's wrong? You're not your usual self. I asked you not to smoke! Sure. Not my usual self, you say? You're not your usual self either. You're not happy, Jack. What's wrong? Did something happen? Something to do with Jenny? There's one person I love, and it's her. Why don't you leave her? I tried to stay away a few days, but I couldn't. Why? Don't ask when I don't want to answer, or I'll leave again. Don't touch me! I've kept my distance, and I'll go on doing so! Why are you badgering me like this? We don't love each other. I don't know. I only know you've changed everything for me, so it's your own fault. Poor Jack. I've said that too often myself. It can't go on. I can't bear another day of grinning. I'm going to kill myself! No, now I'm just acting. Although I always carry a revolver in my pocket. But I don't know anymore if it's to impress myself or to scare a young thing like you. Or if I'm actually serious about it all. I really don't know. Poor Jack. Sure, sure. But you know, you shouldn't feel sorry for me. We get just what we want in life, and we pay the price too. That doesn't stop your pity from being sweet music to my ears. I wish I could help you. - You can help me, Nelly. - How? Take me by the hand, lead me to the police and say... "This boy wants to turn himself in for murder." The police officer will stand up and say... "Murder?" "Yes," you'll say. "He murdered a girl he was living with. She was pregnant. He turned on the gas... and made it look like an accident. It was all very ingenious." Do you feel no regret at all? I couldn't help it, Nelly. I'll go with you to the police. I promise. - Tomorrow? - Yes. Tomorrow. You're so good to me. No, I'm not. May I kiss you? Are you scared? I love you. Don't say that. You don't mean it. I love you. Jack! What did you think of that? Get dressed, Nelly. Let me help you. Don't be afraid, my dear. I just want to help. Just calm down. Everything will be all right. How long has this been going on? - Don't answer her! - Go away! - No, I think I'll stay. Is that so? Then stay. Forgive me, Nelly! Feeling a little better now? You mustn't listen to Jack. I was a fool to think I could have him in the house. He's a sick man. - Don't listen to her! Perhaps he told you about murdering a girl he lived with? About how she had two children? About how he gassed them all and made it look like an accident? Perhaps he asked you to go with him to the police tomorrow to help him turn himself in? Did he show you his revolver and say he had to end his moonlit life? Jenny, that's enough. Perhaps he said you were his anchor in reality. That he can't go on grinning. He must either die or go to the police. Did he tell you that? How many women do you think he's said that to? How many heads has he turned with his moonlit fantasies? Until I found him and sent him to a doctor. You're not telling the truth! You bought me to make me your lover. You were getting too old. No one wanted you. You were afraid of being alone. I was to be your escape. And you brought Nelly here for precisely the same reason. But there'll be no more of these damned games! You've never been any good. I only let you stay out of charity. I could have thrown you out any day. Just like you would Nelly, if she ever wanted to go her own way and not yours. I'm leaving. - Are you? Yes. Good-bye. I suppose you're going to shoot yourself? I hope your little cap gun is properly loaded. Do you know where your head is, so you don't hit something else? You're quite right, my dear Jenny. I probably won't shoot myself. People like me don't kill themselves. It wouldn't be in keeping with my style. Good-bye, Nelly. Good-bye, Jenny. Thanks for everything. If I could pay back all you've spent on me, I still wouldn't do it. Foolish women like you have only themselves to blame. Will he hurt himself? No, you little fool. I'll be leaving too. Yes, just go. Leave me here all alone. Believe me, I'm tough. I've been alone before and managed just fine... maybe even better. When I saw Ingeborg looking so old and ugly and worn out, I thought, "I'm just as old as she is." You can't tell on the outside... but beneath this face... My God! People have always run away from me. Why is that? I've never understood why. Your father was the worst, because I loved him. All the others after him left too. And now you, and Jack. Why aren't you leaving? Go with Jack! I can tell you that somewhere, deep inside, he's a sweet little boy. He never liked me, though I liked him. Do you have money for your trip home? Home! Your trip home... Did I hear gunshots? Gunshots? I heard two shots! Jack! No, let me go! Let me go! He was reading the theater billboards when he suddenly pulled out a gun and shot himself in the face. It was a nasty sight. I put that newspaper over his face. It's good to be back. Why on earth did you move away? I must have lost my head. Though it's very quiet here nowadays. Yes, it is. How idyllic! I didn't mean to intrude. Not at all. We're used to it. Ulf had a calving, and we had some tea. Help yourself if you'd like. Thanks for the tea. It was very nice. Enjoy your tea. Ulf is such a handsome boy! Why don't you go after him? He needs someone to look after him. A level-headed older woman like yourself. Ingeborg! Have you heard from Nelly? - Oh, yes. - Is she all right? - Yes. Any news in particular? Nothing of interest to you. Ingeborg... I've been terribly curious about one thing. Have you now? Will there ever be anything between Nelly and Ulf? He's so fond of her. Jessie... Nelly is fine. She's happy there... and she's not looking to come back. I don't know anything about her and Ulf. Were you expected home today, Nelly? I'd appreciate it if you'd go up to your room, Jessie. I'll be down later. I'm not sick. I'll take your coat. You're just in time for tea. What a surprise! Everything's just the same here. Everything in its place. The piano, the armchair. Is Uffe still here too? - Yes. He left for a while, but he grew weary and came back. Think I could go in and say hello? Of course you can. I'll fix something to eat. I don't want anything. No, of course not. But once it's on the table, I think it'll go down. What's this? You've come home? Yes... I got some time off unexpectedly. You've changed. But to me you're the same. - Don't say any more! - I must! I have so much to tell you. - How could you, Ulf? You've been through a lot, but I can tell you're here to stay. I've waited since you were a girl. I waited while you were away. You and I are good friends. And we always will be. But I want more. Can't you see that? I've barely arrived, and you're already proposing! Don't you see I'm not the same Nelly? I'm completely different! Take me if you dare, then! You love me so much! Don't you dare? Nelly, you're not well. No, I'm not well. I'm not myself! Frightened you a bit, didn't I? No, you don't frighten me. But it frightens me to think what you've been through. Why didn't you take me back then? Why did you let me go? Was it my fault? Because I'm so ordinary, such an "old man"? I know I'm unfair to you. Let me be. Is there someone else? You're so naïve. Why do you ask so many questions? Don't you understand anything? Forgive me. I don't mean to hurt you. I'm going for a walk. I've missed you so darned much. Can I at least say that much? It was all so dreadful. Does she know you're here? I told the maid I was going home. Then it's safe to unpack. I don't know if I'll ever get over it. Two things come back to me constantly: Auntie's face above that mannequin... and Jack lying in the street with a newspaper over his face. I see them over and over. What am I going to do? You remember the old days when we had no money? What was it I would say? "Maybe something nice will happen tomorrow." We have to go on living. We mustn't lose our senses when things get difficult. And Uffe? You frightened the life out of him. Yes, I'm afraid I did. Let's have some tea now. I'll be off to the chapel soon, where I intend to play for a good long while. Little Mutti. Ingeborg. So you're out on this lovely evening. Yes, I have things to attend to. And you have Nelly back again. I have her... on loan. - And how are you doing? - Very well. I'm not afraid anymore. This is such a nice little shortcut. See you. - Yes, see you. We can leave Miss Ingeborg standing here in the sun. She's watching two young people walk down the street, a little distance between them, but together just the same. Nelly and Ulf. The stillness of this Saturday evening lays its gentle hands around this little town that is so small.
