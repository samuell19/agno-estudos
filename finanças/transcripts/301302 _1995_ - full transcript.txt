Our refrigerator is filled with food, but I never eat them cold. When mommy comes home, I'll be eating a warm meal... but because of her work, mommy didn't come home until late night. Our refrigerator is big. It's always filled with fresh meat. My mom's an expert in slicing the meat. But I always imagined how nice it would be if our fridge was filled with yellow O.J. and green apple. Who is it? May I come in for a moment? Why? Just a couple of questions regarding 302. - Do you like chicken? - Pardon? Of course. I've just made some chicken. Have a seat. - Have a seat. Please. - Thank you. If it's about 302, why not ask her directly? Disappeared. - Excuse me? - 302 has disappeared. Please. Want a glass of wine? Of course, we were close... Then would you know of a reason for her to go on a trip or run away? Well, when she came over for a dinner last week, she seemed fine. Oh, it looks much like a restaurant. Nice. Thank you. It's a work of interior designer Chung-Hwa Choi. Did 302 have any male guests? No. Yoon-Hee always rejected eating and sex. 302 didn't really like living... Ah, Song-Hee. - How did you know my name? - Eh... the guard outside... - This is 302, isn't it? - Yes. According to the guard, last he saw... 302 was when she entered the building, so, you must be the last person who saw her. Are you... I'm sorry. Are you implying that I am hiding her? No. What did you two eat that day? Here. Soup with mushroom sauce and 100 grams of shrimp... she ate a little and threw up. Do you keep track everyday? Yes, I always write a cooking diary. - Did you write about today's meal? - Of course. This chicken was the best I've ever had. Pardon me? It's true. - Thank you. - Take care. It's a pill for a mental eating disorder. The patient relates love or sex with food. In another words food is a tool for controlling love. Never knew of it's existence. Shaping your body by mind control. I have something to tell you. She's written a lot primarily for a woman's magazine... also, she didn't have male visitors but... At times she had some phone calls. Was it a man? The phone was never answered... - Any idea who that was? - No. Hello. This is Yoon-Hee. Please leave a message. Yoon-Hee, Yoon-Hee. The life isn't as dirty as you think. Yoon-Hee, Yoon-Hee. Congratulations. You've made the right choice. Like you've seen in the advertisement, this apartment building is design for a modern single woman. Come on, hurry up. You are repeating yourself, just unlock the door. For me, the kitchen is most important. I'd like an open space. How many rooms do you need? Just one big open space. Whatever the interior is I want a unified atmosphere. Wall paper is too common. How about sand mixed in cement... It's her. The walking mannequin... - Disgusting. - All nutrition is drained. Her breasts could feed a hundred men. Such a pig! I've got to supplement her with animal fat. Need help? Don't touch it. Sure, food and plates are most important to you. Congratulations. You must have been... sick of my cooking for last 5 years. Actually, I'm going to miss your cooking. Oh, why is it that I've lost 15 lbs. Eating your food and you've gained weight? You may say that you've been miserable but people will think otherwise. You mean a pig? Right. You were wonderful at one time. A good cook, organized the dishes well, ate well... You'll be welcomed anywhere. Oh, an advise. Give the money to a financial management company. They'll be a good investment. What about this set? Oh this? It was your anniversary present. I'll take it. As a divorce present. Sure. I can still loose weight while I enjoy cooking. No more cooking diary for Joon-Shik. Thank you for the script. Unfortunately, we are unable to use it because it's... solely based on a personal story. I apologize. - Who is it? - It's your neighbor, 301. Hello. I hope you'll like it. It's flounder with a special lemon sauce. It's my 1st creation in my new oven. Thanks but I already had dinner. Then you should have it later. Hi. This Si Yoon-Hee Kim. Please leave a message. Hi, this is Jang-Soo Bae with Lady magazine. Are you a writer? The readers loved your diet-column. Yes. Let's be a good neighbors. Please call me. Sure. Do you live by yourself? Yes. You look like a model. Enjoy. Oh, don't let it sit too long, it won't taste as good. For Song-Hee's new hope! For Song-Hee's new independence! For Song-Hee's diet! You'll see. I'll be a changed a woman. Like before... OK. Are you home? It's been a long time. May I come in? I hope I'm not bothering you. - Please sit down. - Thank you. It's like a library here. This is a sausage mignon. Try it. I have to refuse. Especially sausage... You must not like sex. Were you raped? Not me. I crave it as much as cooking. I enjoyed having sex with my ex-husband even without love. Gosh. You are so skinny. I recently lost 25 lbs. And for what? It's no fun. That's why I've started cooking again. What are you writing about lately? Stuff... I can't write as I wish. Not one good literature these days. Why don't you write something good? Please just leave me alone. I'm sorry. Feel like vomiting bitch? You must think I'm a totally sex crazed loony. Hey, sex isn't disgusting. Love is. You'll see. Besides the sausage, I'll cook everything I know how. How dare you laugh at weight. I'm going to plump you up. Are you going somewhere? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I couldn't eat it. Get in. Hurry. Now. Eat it. Hurry up. Eat it all. It's my creation. Hold on. Now. Eat it. Just eat. I got divorced because of my cooking. Who are you to throw away my food? Eat and get fat! I can't eat it. My body refuses it. NO. Not only food but everything that has to do with this world. Please. Who cares? Eat it. Please! I wish I could just disintegrate from this world. Please get in. Sit down. Sit down. I wasn't myself. No, I'm sorry. Today, I made a special dish for you. You can probably eat it. Eat it. Eat it. Open your mouth and eat. It's your favorite dish. If you don't eat, I'll kill you... - You're late. - Yes. Come here. Call if you're going to be late. I'll go pick you up. Hi mom. When did you come? Wash your hands and eat. Damn, I lost count... Eating is everything. Oops, I almost forgot. Which bank was it? You and your memory. It's good for your health. Eat. Cut it in thin slices. In thin slices, thank you. Should I disappear? Should I disappear? Don't say such things. Should I die? Are you reading a book or talking to me? Your father is providing you with everything you need. If he knew, he would kill us both. - Don't act like a stepdaughter. - Never! Please. I've heard it for 5 years now. What are you doing? - Want to play hide and seek? - Later... Hi. Is Yoon-Hee studying? I've rented some videos for her. Watch the store while I'm gone. Where are you going? To the bank. You are? Take your time. No. Hello, hello. Hello. Hi, Ji-Hae. 5 lbs. Of pork please. For Ji-Hae, only the yummy part. Are you playing hide and seek? - Slice it thick please. - Sure. I almost died of concussion. You'll be damned for what you do. Watch what the hell you are saying. - Who is it? - I'm sorry. Have you seen Ji-Hae? Why would she be here at this hour? She went out to go play hide and seek... this afternoon and hasn't come home. Sorry to have bothered you. That's where I am. It's not that I'm on a diet. I just can't eat. My body's son full of dirty things... How can I stuff food or men in my body. I wish I could disintegrate. From now, I'll only make tender food. I'm a great cook, you know. No doubt you'll enjoy my cooking. Also, I'll write a cooking diary for you. - Where's the spinach? - Over here. I'd like some please. I'm sorry, the local supermarket must have sold me spoiled food. Oh, and the spinach... It's not easy to digest... It's not that. I just can't take in anything. Regardless of taste. Get some rest here. Until you can eat my wonderful food. I'm dedicating a cooking diary for you. Cooking, eating, not eating, vomiting, women are strange. Have you... gotten a divorce? Me? Why? I'm... Hello? Yes, it's me. I know. According to her ex-husband, she's killed a dog. A dog? What for? The neighbors say that she cooked the pet dog and fed her husband. Who's she? 301 or 302? Across the way, so 301. That's why they got a divorce. That can be a reason for a divorce? By the way, what are you eating? Get yourself some real food. Chong Chong. You hungry again? Don't pee on the table, OK? - Hello? - Hello? May I speak to Song-Hee's husband please? Is this Joon-Shik Kang's wife? Yes I am... today's Joon-Shik's cooking diary is extra special. I know. When you cook, it's always special. - Today's main dish is... - Stop. Let's save our phone time. What? I miss you more this way. See you at home. How is it? Good? How is Kim-Chi? Good? It's good. And me? - What about me?? Can I do this? - Do what? For 24 hours, that's all I thought about. Me too. You too? It drove me crazy. For real? - Shall we? - Now? Yeah. We're such perverts. You're gonna leave me hanging? It was my favorite. It's me. I was busy today. That's nice. Thoughts of you... what should I cook for you... oh, I replaced the curtains. That's nice. I wish I can rearrange the whole place... I'm busy. If you have time wash Chong Chong. He stinks. Bye. I'm busy? Whatever. How is the mud-fish broth? Good? Yes. - That coral is real. - I know. - Smells good, huh? - Yes. Is it really good? I'm glad. - There's plenty more. - That's alright. Cooking is getting harder. Takes a long time too... No need. Do simple things. Simple? Instant food? Yes. No. That's not cooking. How is it? Good? How is it? Good? It's making me crazy. And your cooking always have to be good... I going to get some work done now. Joon-Shik. Joon-Shik. You've changed. Same conversation for over a year. It's be strange if I didn't change. You do admit you've changed. You've changed, changed. Joon-shik, I made some dumplings. You hardly ate earlier. If the food wasn't good, it's not my fault. There probably was something wrong with the recipe. If you don't want dumplings, I could make something else. Please. Please. OK? - Hello? - It's mom. Yeah? - Happy anniversary. - Thank you. Turn the TV off or something. I have a good news for you. Remember my friend Mr Choi? There's a new product called Supper slim. It works wonders. It's not harmful to your health. It's perfect for you. I'll send some. You should watch your weight. It could affect your marriage life. I was never like you. Is Joon-Shik home yet? Hello? Hello? Don't know. Hang up. I'm sorry. I know it's our anniversary. I was busy today. Of course. Busy fucking. Why are you acting so low? That's right. I'm a pig. Busy stuffing my face at home. I'm sorry. We'll have a party tomorrow. Chong-Chong. Chong-Chong. Why didn't you marry Chong-Chong. Oh, the present is from my friends. Chong-Chong! What the hell are you doing at home? Can't you even watch a dog? Treat me like a sex-crazed person? Bastard. Chong-Chong... let's have light breakfast from now on. I'm not criticizing your cooking. These days, our office people eat specials from MacDonald's or udon off the street... Is that why you but women off the street? This'll be the last time I cook for you. I used you favorite recipe. I'll do as you wish. What I need right now is money. I'll only concentrate on cooking better cuisine. I've only wanted simple things. Sparkling silverware. Beautiful soprano from the crystals. Of course the music is nice too... Chopin or Thriller... All this woman do is think of sex or cook. He has broken my hopes and dreams and I had to substitute food for love. Instead of his interest I had ice cream... Think of my pain. Having to eat all that food. Repetition of appraisals. And the most important part is the changes in my body. From 100 lbs. To 158 lbs... She's crazy. She's even cooked our pet dog. I wouldn't be surprised if she uses me as a recipe. Stop. You're still alive. And you've had her wonderful cooking for 5 years. She deserves an alimony and a labor compensation. If we didn't separate... I would have killed him. I wonder what he would have tasted like... not good. How did you think of cooking Chong-Chong? I always wonder what should I cook with what recipe. It was so hard plucking his fur. You know after chopping off his head there wasn't that much to eat. You know. Maltese... so I made Souffle for one. At first, he devoured it without knowing what it was. I'll go make some juice. Anyway, 302 disappeared. - Drink this and please leave. - Oh, yes. There's nothing in this world for you to eat. Do you think Chong-Chong felt much pain? What do you think? I'm still alive. Do you think I wouldn't taste good? Could that be the end of two women's pain?
