Poor thing! It must have been washed away from somewhere. It would end up being somebody's meal at this rate. You'll be popping out of there before you know it. Lord of the Egg Mountain, please protect these children. Let them hatch safe and sound. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm your mother! Huh? That's a strange child. What color is that?! And those sharp teeth! Is he safe? We don't want a meat-eater child around here! But look at how happy he is eating berries... Perhaps now, but... Is this the child that was born from the egg that was found? Y-Yes... Stop it! What are you doing?! He could be a meat-eater. Better to kill him now, to be safe! Kill him?! If you don't want that, then get rid of him! We have our own children to take care of. But... he's too small to... He's small now, but if he's a meat-eater, he'll eat us all up sooner or later! Including you and your son! There's a lot of food for you here. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. They're all migrating north, huh? Yeah. Let's go, Heart! Wait for me! Wait, Light! Come here, Heart! Again?! But I've never won at this... 1-2-3! You're as weak as always, Heart! You're too picky about what you eat, and that's why you don't get stronger. Just eating soft berries... But when I try to eat leaves... ...it makes me gag. Yuck! You're eating that kind of thing again?! I don't eat it. Just sucking on it feels good. Ick! Yuck! Heart, you're a weirdo! I'm gonna suck on your tail next, Light! Light! Heart! Oh, Mom! Mom, everyone went north. Why didn't we go with them? I don't care for the cold up there. Besides, I'm just happy being with you two. Looks like it's going to be another fine day tomorrow. We've got to look for more berries that Heart can eat. Why don't we make an outing of it tomorrow? Heart should get used to eating acorns and leaves and everything else. Let's not talk like that. I can eat anything! All right, both of you look for a nice treat to eat. Use both your eyes and nose to find out what's where. Okay! Don't eat everything off of one tree! Red berries! Yayyy! Mmm, these are the best, aren't they? Uh-huh! You're chasing small animals again?! I'm stuck! M-Me too! Let go! Let go of me! The Big Jaw comes for children who cry... With his coarse body and sharp fangs... The Big Jaw comes for children who cry... He says, "Where are the crying children? I'm coming to get you!" "With my coarse body... And my sharp fangs..." "-Coarse body... And my sharp fangs..." Sharp fangs...?! He says, "Where are the crying children? I'm coming to get you!" Light... Boys... Would you mind not raising your voices? My baby just fell asleep. D-Did you sing that? Are you... a Big Jaw? Am I a Big Jaw? You must be kidding me! Big Jaws are giant, fearsome meat-eaters who would gobble all of us up! They would eat us? That's right... And they will if you don't listen to your mother, boys! What was that about? She ran away after looking at you, Heart. Why? Why...? Come to think of it, you look a little like the Big Jaws, Heart. You have a coarse body and sharp teeth... Look, you're different from me, see? I'm different from you, Light? Well, sure. Liar! H-Hey, Heart! Is that Heart's voice? Heart! Light! Mom! How dare you say that to him?! Heart is your little brother, isn't he? I won't have you saying things like that to him. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Don't cry, Heart! Don't cry! It's glistening. It would be nice if we could live in this beautiful valley forever. Yeah... But there aren't that many red berries left here, are there? I wonder why I can't eat leaves and acorns like everybody else. Everyone has a weakness. Don't let what Light said get to you. He didn't really mean anything bad by it, but... Mom, don't scold Light. Light's always searching for soft fruits for me. I see. He has his kind side too, doesn't he? Yeah. And you're very kind. I'm proud of both of you boys. My body itches... The least I can do... ...is find my own food! What is this? My heart's beating fast! Light, go call your brother. We've gathered enough for today. Let's go home. Okay. He said he was going by the river, so I'll bring him back. Don't worry, Mom. Wait right here. Out of the way, shrimp! You're in the way! You're dead... O-One-Eyed Baku! The Three-Horns are tough customers. Too bad about him. I'm sorry to put you to the trouble, Baku. This is your prey. Don't stand on ceremony. I appreciate it. Th-They're eating him... They're eating him! I have to get out of here! I haven't seen you around before. Where you from? What's with this kid? What's wrong, Gonza? This kid is weird. He reeks like a plant-eater. Let me see... Hey, he smells yummy. Right? What's wrong? Are you hungry? Are you alone? Got no parents? I-I have a mom... Light, too... Then go home to her. This isn't your territory. You guys, too, leave him alone. Hey. What's your name? Heart! My name is Heart! All right, Heart. Be careful going home. There are some around her who'll be drawn to the smell of blood. The smell of blood? Coarse body! Sharp fangs! They're gonna eat us! Those were... ...Big Jaws! They're gonna eat me! They're gonna eat me! They devoured that one! They were eating him! They were eating him! They were eating him! They were eating him! Heart! Heart, what happened?! Are you all right?! Are you hurt?! You're shivering! Mom! Mom! It's okay, Heart. I'm here. Let's go back together. Huh! What have we here? I was wondering why you ran into this soggy-looking, little forest... But it was to meet a plant-eater?! What's the connection between you two? Heart! Run away, Heart! You're an odd couple. A plant-eater's worried about a meat-eater?! Heart's my little brother! I'm not gonna let you lay a claw on him! How could he be your little brother? Take a good look at me. Look at me! That's right. Get a good look. I look like your weird-named friend, "Heart" or whatever. That one's just like me, a meat-eater, the king of the plains... A Big Jaw! It's a lie... It's a lie. It's no lie. You're lucky, getting to learn one more thing in your last moments. And I think it's about time... It's a lie! No, it's not! Liar, liar! I'm a plant-eater! I'm my mother's son! H-Hey. You're a clueless brat, aren't you? Liar, liar! What do you think you have those choppers for? Try sinking your teeth into his neck. Then you'll understand. You're a Big Jaw and he's an irresistible treat. You lie! You lie! You lie! You lie! Liar!! Eeeyowww! Let go of me, you little...! Owowowowowww! All right, I got it! So stop! Let go of meeee! Heart! Why? We're the same... Owowowowowwww! Heart! H...? Heart? What should I do? Meat is delicious! Heart! Heart! Where are you going?! We have to get back! Mom is... Heart will be pleased with all these berries I've gathered. I hope they get back soon... Sleepy baby, sleepy baby, sleepy, go to sleep The Big Jaw comes for children who cry... With his coarse body and sharp fangs... - Stay on guard! - With his coarse body and sharp fangs... - He's nearby! - With his coarse body and sharp fangs... - Yes, Captain! - With his coarse body and sharp fangs... With his coarse body and sharp fangs... Don't flinch, trample him! Yes, Captain! Captain, I'm dizzy from standing up so much! Hang in there! Protect the children! Captain, I can't go on anymore! I'm done for, too! Me too... You bunch of gutless worms! Still, as long as I'm here, you're not robbing this herd! Uh-oh! Heart! You horned in on my territory again! What are you tryin' to do?! Sorry, my bad! But you can have my leftovers, so don't hold a grudge! Okay, stubby Gonza?! Why, youuu...! You're dead! Heart! In my childhood, I was raised as a plant-eater. I don't know why my mother did that, but in order to become a full-fledged Big Jaw, I have to train my body more than anyone else. My arms are especially weak... I have to get stronger... Well, well... We finally come back to the base of Egg Mountain, and right away, a nuisance shows up, saying he wants to return to the herd. No, it's my mother... I, uh... Fine. You look to be sturdy enough, boy, so as long as you're willing to serve the herd, I'll grant a special pardon. Yes, thank you. It finally sunk in, didn't it? You're yummy, I bet. Huh? Papa! Papa! Papa! Me? Papa, you just named me, didn't you? Name? You said, "You're Yummie!" You named me, so you're my papa, right? "Yummie" is a great name! But what does it mean? M-Mean... um... Papa, I'm starving. Where's the food? Food?! I'm starving! Where's my food?! Oh, food, huh? Oh! Wow! You're tall, Papa. Papa, you're amazing! R-Really? Uh-huh. You're really big and cool! I wanna grow up to be like you, Papa! That was scary. You scared me! You've gotta be more careful! You're still too young to stand up on your hind legs! Wait 'til you're bigger! I'm sorry. As long as you understand. Next time, be more care... huh? Well, he'll make a more substantial meal if I wait 'til he gets bigger, right? This is delicious! Papa, aren't you going to eat any? Weeds are too tough for me. Go ahead, you eat my share and get bigger. Yeah, I'm gonna eat a lot and get really big! Heart... Heart... Mom? Mom?! Heart... Where are you? Mom! Mom! Where?! Where are you?! Mom! Heart. I'm right here. You just ate me, remember? Papa... How much is he gonna eat?! Before long, he's probably gonna have that field stripped bare. Ah, well, it doesn't make sense just sitting around, waiting for him to get big. I'm gonna grab a bite to eat myself. Why are you following me? Um... I'm always gonna follow you, Papa! I see... But there are times, Yummie, when a man wants to be alone. So wait for me in that field! Okay?! Got it! There's a good boy. You don't "got" anything! You wait for me right here! I'll be back soon! Yeesh! Watch it, or I'll gobble you up! I couldn't eat another bite. Is he still waiting? Well, it'd be annoying if somebody else snatched him from me... Something's wrong with the kid if he thinks I'm his father... I wanted to eat with you, Papa... You look yummy! Huh? You know who I am, Mister? Of course. What makes you so tasty is that you're nice and crunchy! Crunchy? Waiiiit!! Touch somebody else's property, will ya?! Wowie! But why did you slam into him? Idiot! He was about to eat you! If you're not careful, you're gonna end up as some meat-eater's appetizer! Huh... Thanks, Papa! You really are great. I'm gonna grow up to be big and strong like you! Do you really understand? He doesn't understand anything! The moment I take my eyes off of him... Yummie! Where are you?! Yay! There's a bunch! Hey, hard one... What are you gonna do with those berries? I... Yummie! Yummie! Yummie! Yummie!! Yummie! Where'd you go, Yummie?! Where the devil did he go?! You two didn't eat Yummie, did you?! W-We haven't had anything to eat! Yummie, where are you?! Maybe somebody did eat him... Yummie... Papa! See, these look delicious, don't they? You don't like grass, so I went a long way to pick 'em. Now we can eat... Idiot!! Why did you go far off by yourself?! A little kid like you wandering around is bound to be eaten! Do you know how much I worried about you?! Next time, don't bother coming back! You can be somebody else's child! I'm sorry! I wanted to eat together, Papa! Eat? Eat what? You brought these...? A-All right. It's all right, so stop crying. Here, I'll eat. But get up. Ready? Look. It's delicious, Yummie. Really? Really, Yummie. It really is good. Good! But I'm surprised you were able to carry that much on your back. A nice old one helped me. Hah?! When I told him that my name was Yummie, not "Hard-one", he said that even if I'm "Yummie" I'm too hard to chew up for a senior citizen. I wonder what he meant... What he meant... Where is the old one? Old one, I brought my papa here! Oh, you're back, boy? What's your game? What kind of greeting is that? Don't you have any manners, young one? You ate my fruit, didn't you? Here, why don't you at least give me your name and a word of thanks? I-I'm Heart. Thanks. Oh, you're that bad boy people talk about. A mischievous one who was raised by a plant-eater, but now wreaks havoc. I often hear complaints about your behavior. "Your fruit"? You're carrying it on your back... Old man, do you eat that too? I know it's disgraceful for a Big Jaw to eat this kind of food, but I can't move like I used to. Huh? You were once a Big Jaw? How rude... Before, the young ones would give me their leftovers, but that's stopped recently, so these are emergency rations. The same as your companion, the hard one. I told you, my name's Yummie, not "Hard-one"! S-Stupid! I'm Bekon. Heart, if you cause too much trouble, One-Eyed Baku will zero in on you. He's the king of this prairie. Anger him and a simple apology won't cover it. You know about Baku?! Of course. There's nobody else like him. A long time ago, a pack of voracious scoundrels came up from the south. And they were so huge that nobody could defeat them. But then, Baku, alone... ...defeated them, thereby protecting our territory. After that, Baku became the king of the prairie. He's big, strong, and prudent. You should strive to be a guy like that. Huh?! Yummie?! What are you doing?! It was different in my younger days, but my teeth couldn't handle him now. The next time you come, bring something softer to eat. You play the innocent, old one. By the way... What do you plan to do with him? He isn't the least bit afraid of us, but that won't last forever. Even raised by a plant-eater, you eat meat. So even raised by a meat-eater, he'll eat plants. I'm sure you're fully aware of that. Come and get me! Come and get me! All right! That's the way to carry yourself! If you can dodge me, you'll be fine with just about anyone! Really?! Listen, Yummie. From now on, I'm gonna train you to be a survivor. But no matter how tough it gets, don't you cry! I'm not gonna cry! I'm gonna become strong like you, Papa! Good answer! You left yourself open! Papa, are you okay? Tomorrow, I'll teach you how to headbutt. The dust carries your smell, But I don't care, pretend I don't notice If singing passion calls forth a storm, Before long everything should be washed away Jump kick, tail smash, give it all ya got Headbutt, heartbeat If you're faster than anyone, All you have to do is notice that you're alone A fallen, crushed skull Will probably return to the sand someday Just like yesterday and the past, even you But right now, don't worry, just keep running Chance, kick, tail smash, long as you live Headbutt, heartbeat Right now, all ya gotta do Is run like lightning and not look back Smear your body with the red of a lion, to the middle of scars that can't be healed Run from the ground that's burning now And here, where you've arrived, live forever The dust carries your smell, But I don't care, pretend I don't notice If singing passion calls forth a storm, Before long everything should be washed away Jump kick, tail smash, give it all ya got Headbutt, heartbeat If you're faster than anyone, All you have to do is notice you're alone Listen! You need to put more oomph into it, from the stomach! Now, that was a good one! If you roar with that voice, most of 'em will turn tail and run! Really?! Thank you, Papa! I wanna be like you, Papa! I wonder if I can... Yeah, uh, who knows? "I wanna be like you, Papa", huh? I'm not his parent. I'm secretly raising him, but someday, the lie will come to light. How did Mom feel, raising me? Hey, Yummie... What, Papa? I've taught you everything I know. Huh? Today, we go our separate ways. From now on, you live on your own. Don't forget what I taught you and be careful, so you can live long. Do you understand what I'm saying? Nooo!! We can't be together forever! Why not? No! No! I won't go! Papa, I wanna be like you! I'm gonna stay with you! You mustn't be like me... Yummie. You can't be like me. Why do you say that? I don't care! I don't care! Papa, I'm gonna stay with you! All right, let's have a race. If you beat me, I'll stay with you forever. Eh? Papa? You'd better get along. If you don't have a head start on me, you stand no chance of winning. Huh? But... Go on now. Papa... Hurry up, Yummie. Papa, if I win, will you really stay with me forever? Ready... go! Papa, Papa, Papa!! Go, Yummie, go! Yummie... Take care of yourself. Papa...? Papa? Where did you come from? Huh? What's wrong, runt? Are you done already? You little...! Owowowow! Hey, don't go overboard. You'll break your leg. You think a pipsqueak like this is tough enough to break my leg?! Little booger is small, but... Take that! Oh, he still has some fight left in him. Yummie! Hey, small fry, are you alive? Maybe he's dead. Yummie!! Oh, you. Take a hike, Heart. You're not wanted here. Sleepy baby, sleepy baby, sleepy, go to sleep You dare snatch prey right out of his mouth?! Sleepy baby, sleepy baby, sleepy, go to sleep The Big Jaw comes for children who cry With his coarse body and sharp fangs The Big Jaw comes for children who cry He says, "Where are the crying children? I'm coming to get you!" "With my coarse body..." What's he angry about? - And my sharp fangs..." - What's he angry about? - And my sharp fangs..." - You're the one who stole from us! You're the one who stole from us! He says, "Where are the crying children? I'm coming to get you!" The Big Jaw comes for children who cry With his coarse body and sharp fangs -Scum! The Big Jaw comes for children who cry The Big Jaw comes for children who cry He says, "Where are the crying children? I'm coming to get you!" "With my coarse body..." "And my sharp fangs..." H-Heart, you... He says, "Where are the crying children? I'm coming to get you!" This is your work, isn't it? You beat all of them by yourself? There are no bite wounds. Why didn't you use your fangs? Baku... You encroached on others' territory and harmed members of your own species. Get far away from here. And never set foot in this prairie again. If you come back, your next opponent will be me. Damn you, Heart... Yummie... Yummie... Papa...? Yummie... They did a real number on you. Papa... I didn't lose the race, did I? Eh? From now on, we can be together forever, right? Right, Papa? Let's go together, Yummie. Father and son, together. I'm so glad... It's warm in your tummy, Papa. Dummy. I didn't eat you! You're in my mouth. Exile was quite a lenient sentence, wasn't it? Some won't be satisfied with the judgment. I bet there'll be more trouble down the line. No, it won't happen again. Hmm... By the way, that Heart is the spitting image of you when you were young. The scarlet skin texture, the solid-colored forehead... Rare characteristics... That egg you lost... The child you were meant to have with poor Kamie... Was that... Something that happened a long time ago. Well, I accept this gratefully. Pick me some of those red berries, too. As a garnish, they go surprisingly well with meat. Hey, Pero Pero! Hi, Heart. So, you've decided to go home? Yeah. I'm intrigued by what that migratory bird told you. About how Egg Mountain will be destroyed... Do you remember the first time we met? That again? How many times do you have to bring that up? Sorry, but I can't forget your big frame falling, crying out, "Somebody, help!", and then sinking my way. Not like I could help it. That cliff collapsed right out from under me. At first, you hid your identity... The fact that you were a fearsome Big Jaw of the shore. Sorry about that. But when you saved me from a Big Jaw of the sea... ...my cover was blown, huh? Even so, I wasn't scared of you. Well, you saved my life, Pero Pero. I'd never eat you. Then what about that boy? He thinks I'm his father, so... That's what I like about you. When I was a kid, I ran out on my mother without saying anything. Because you were afraid you'd eat her? That's right. But now I'm afraid of her seeing me like this, as I am. Well, I think she'd be fine. You're a good guy. So... My advice is go to see your mother at once, before Egg Mountain is destroyed. Run swiftly, Heart! Bye-bye! Let's meet again! See you again. Yummie, wake up. We're leaving. Oh! That's happened many times this year... Mom, on a day like this... The smoke stinks, thanks to the way the wind's blowin'... It's been a long time since something like this happened. Egg Mountain just may erupt. Baku! It's him! The lawbreaker came back! Gonza went alone to drive him away, but the way that guy is now, I'm doubtful... By "the lawbreaker", you mean that one guy? I mean Heart! Heart, who was exiled from here! He was running towards Egg Mountain. Gonza chased after him. Bekon, could you keep an eye on things here? Sure, but what are you...? Oh... Ah, well, at a time like this... ...all I can do is sit back and let things run their course. Oh! You're not getting past me... Heart. Huh. Is that the kid from our last encounter? What do you want with my Papa?! Oh, you're here with your "Papa"! Step aside! I'm not moving. I came here to settle things between us once and for all. Come on, Heart. If you want to get by, you'll have to defeat me first. You'll die... And I'll take you with me. Come on, Yummie. Okay! Pipsqueak, he's not your father! I know! I'm not a child anymore! But Papa is Papa! Had to spoil my fun... Yummie... This is getting serious... Mom! Damn it! Should we work our way around from the plains? She may have rejoined the herd... Ow, it's hot! Yummie! Y'know, you've gotten bigger! The herd! Mom! Light! Are you here?! Mom! Mom! Mom! Light! Are you here?! Heart?! Heart, is that you? Light?! Light, you've got to get away from here now! If you don't get away from the mountain... Mom... Where's Mom?! She left this morning and hasn't come back. I think maybe she went to where we used to live. Why aren't you out there looking for her?! You have no right to say that, not after being gone for years! Right now, I have to put the herd above thinking about myself! Light, don't talk to him! All you have to do is escape! If you leave now, you can get downstream! The children born this year are still small... ...and everyone is so scared, they can barely move. I don't know what to do! But I can't leave here now. I have to protect the herd. That's more important than Mom?! Ridiculous! Get outta here! I'm gonna eat you! Run! If you don't get outta here, I'm gonna devour you! We'll be eaten! Calm down! Everyone, calm down! Heart... Egg Mountain's egg is... gone?! Mom!! Egg Mountain is gone! Mom! Are you safe?! Mom!! I forgot the forest was this thick! Mom!! Mom! Heart! Heart, it's you, isn't it? I was so worried when you ran off without a word. Mom!! Mom, I'm so happy you're safe! Heart... I've missed you. But... look what I've become! No, I knew as soon as I saw you... ...that you were my kind Heart. Mom! Mom, we can't stay here. We have to get away from the mountain. Yes. When you came, the children were resting after coming down from the ridge. Children? Come out, everyone. It's time to leave. Whose children are these? Don't be afraid, everyone. This is your big brother. Big brother?! Then they're your...? Mm-hm. I see. Your children... Papa! Oh... Heart, who's this boy? Um... This is Yummie. He's, uh... my son. Parents and children resemble each other, don't they? It's a pleasure to meet you, Yummie. I'm your grandma. Is Heart a kind father? Yeah. And Papa is also really strong! Oh my! Well, shall we go? Heart! It's okay, Mom! Mom, are you all right? Yes, thank you, Light! Light... You don't have to watch the herd? They've all escaped, thanks to you menacing them, I think. Well, good. Ow... We'd better hurry. Hey, Heart... What? Don't you eat meat? I do. Without eating meat, I'd die. I just decide what and whether or not to eat, based on the circumstances. Oh... Big brother, are you going to eat me? No, I wouldn't do that. But you have to be careful about guys like me. In other words... The Big Jaw comes for children who cry With his coarse body and sharp fangs The Big Jaw comes for children who cry He says, "Where are the crying children?" - Baku hasn't come back yet... - He says, "Where are the crying children? - Baku hasn't come back yet... - I'm coming to get you!" "With my coarse body... With my coarse body..." "And my sharp fangs... And my sharp fangs..." He says, "Where are the crying children? I'm coming to get you." Let's hurry so we can catch up with everyone. Baku?! I followed the smell of Gonza's blood. At this point, there's nothing that needs to be said, is there? Everyone, go on ahead. Heart? He's got business with me. What is it, Heart? Light, take Yummie, too. Papa! Heart, no... Let's go together! Heart! Don't run! If anyone runs away, I'll eat all of them! I'm not gonna run away! It's true. You are... Everyone! What's wrong? This isn't settled yet. If you want a hope of saving them, you had better hurry up and finish this showdown. This place is about to be engulfed in flames. Not like that! Show me your strength, head-on! Fine! Is that all you got?! Heart! Baku!! Heart... Heart! Mom! Please, let him go! Please! Don't kill him! Who are you? P-P-P... He's my child. So please... Let him go! You raised him? Yes. The first time I met him, he was skinny, all skin and bones. Big Jaws are the kings of the meat-eaters. If we don't eat meat, we can't survive. What were you trying to do with him? Even if in the end, I was eaten... Idiot! Did you intend to sentence him to a lifetime of suffering?! Although, if you hadn't raised him, he wouldn't have lived. Take him. This bout is a draw. You've gotten stronger, Heart. Are you Heart's...? The next time we meet... No, tell him it's better that we don't meet again. Stop it! It's early, before the changing of the seasons... ...but we're going to head north. And we may not return. I'm going to stay behind. Mom! Let's live together, you, me, and your little brothers. It's better for my little brothers to live among their own kind. You're probably right. You wanted the same thing, didn't you? No. Mom, we can't live together now... ...but thank you for raising me. I'm glad that I'm your son. Heart! No matter where you go, I'll always, always, always... Well, I'm going to get going. Light, take good care of Mom and our little brothers. I will. You take good care, too. Yeah. And you, too, Light. Let's go, Yummie! Okay! Heart!! Mom!! Is the scenery in your heart the same setting sun that's in mine? When I miss you, I think of you with a smile appearing on your tear-stained face Somehow, if only a for a moment feel the precious thing that can only be seen in your heart Right now, over and over, the words we want to say to each other have no answer If I just live strongly, second by second, the memories inscribed in my heart will never disappear I am here, you, my beloved, -So you finally came back? I am here, you, my beloved, -You look much the worse for wear. I am here, you, my beloved, are here, and our song is here -Ah, well, have a seat. are here, and our song is here are here, and our song is here If you're hungry, are here, and our song is here -go ahead and have some of my berries. are here, and our song is here -go ahead and have some of my berries. How many more times will we How many more times will we be able to see this setting sun together? - That's not what a respectable Big Jaw eats. - be able to see this setting sun together? Be able to see this setting sun together? The wish that I'm singing now is for our tears and smiles to always be pictured in the sky If I just live strongly, second by second, the setting sun will reflect in these eyes Right now, over and over, -Egg mountain?! Right now, over and over, Right now, over and over, the words we want to say to each other have no answer If I just live strongly, second by second, I'm sure I'll be able to hear in my heart, "There are no dreams that can't come true." No matter where you go, I'll always... Always, always... I'll always love you.
