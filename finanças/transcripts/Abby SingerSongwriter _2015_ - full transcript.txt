Get him. - Call it, what are you calling it? - We're calling this Hooverville take one. - Hooverville, take you one, slate. - Press play. You're going to need to be, play it loud enough that you can hear it. We're doing this. Come on. Stand by. - Glenn, you have one job. It's to press one button and you're fucking that up. I mean, shit, I thought. Okay good, now get the fuck out of the way before these fucking assholes start, get over there with the bitches. No, but I got to hear it. Get the music towards us Glenn so we can hear the fucking thing. Who's the clown now, Block? Who's the clown now, Block? You're the clown now, buddy. Buddy, buddy, buddy. * Henry * Is climbing a tall tree * In my memory * Let's do it again - Sunset Park. - I'm going to Park Slope, we should share a cab. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's going to be cheaper, right? - Absolutely. - You're not trying to take advantage of me or anything like that, are you? - No. - Okay. - Go on in. Where from, young man? - I'm from North Carolina. - You don't look like you are from North Carolina. Where are you from originally? - Well, I'm Turkish, originally. My parents are Turkish. So I'm Turkish. - Okay, no problem, but in this case, you must always remember, fuck all enemies of America! - Hey, on that note, you know, what are you doing in New York? - Well, I just moved here to, just moved here to make movies, actually. He's kidding, right? - Listen, it's a dollhouse. Quit being a baby. - It's not just a dollhouse, it's an antique. And you know what? You're a liar! - Come on, Jo. Get in the car. You're a jerk, and now I know why Mom divorced you. - Can we get, I'm going to get this dollhouse next weekend. - The auction's tonight, so you can only get it tonight. - We'll get you a better dollhouse soon. Okay? Yeah, whatever. - Say goodbye to your sister. - Fuck off. You actually edit still? - Well, I dabble. You know, I've done one wedding video. - I think it's amazing, the synchronicity. What are the chances I share a taxi, the first guy I meet in New York is an actual film editor. - Yeah, don't get carried away, you know. - Wedding videos, that's, wedding videos aren't that, that's not. - There's this one I did that, it was a funny story. So I did a wedding video for my Uncle Harvey. It was one of those weddings where they hoist the person up in the chair. Have you ever seen one of those? - That's like a Jewish wedding, right? - Yeah, right, a Jewish, yeah, exactly. Why do they always, because they feel above everyone else? - Thanks for coming home and seeing your old man. - Yes, it's nice seeing you, Dad. - Good for you sticking with college. It's important. - Yeah, I hope it goes better this semester. - It will. It will, and it's okay to be uncertain. You know, I haven't been on stage in 10 years, so I don't even know how it's going to go tonight. Yeah. I hope I remember what to do. - Yeah, yeah, well you'll do great. You don't think I'm too over the hill? - Hey, I have to make my train. - All right. Well, hey, listen, call me right when you got there. - Okay I will, love you! - Right when you get there. - You should make a music video. I thought I was staying in your room. I thought we were going to sleep-- - No. Oh, I mean things have changed. What do you mean? - Uh, I met somebody. Wait, I just talked to you two days and told you I was coming up here. I mean... - Yeah, but he was nice. - Uh, wait, don't you, remember the Governor's Ball? I mean, I thought, you know, everything was-- - Oh, come on. Did you find a job yet? - No, I just got off the plane. I haven't even had lunch yet. - I really think you should find a job and another place to stay as soon as possible. - So we're a young production company but we're looking for a director with a unique vision. - Oh, I've totally got a unique vision. I'm color blind in one eye and slightly dyslexic in the other eye. That's a joke. - Ah, we don't do comedy here. - Look, I know. I researched the company. You guys do edgy short films, PSAs, commercials, music videos. I'm down with that. I can do that. I'm good at that. - Oh great. So do you have a reel or something I can watch? - A reel. Like an online reel. No. But I mean, but I directed a really cool car commercial, car commercial. I directed a great car commercial for a small dealership back where I'm from. That's great. Where is that? - Taylorsville, North Carolina. That's not important. The video itself. That's all you need to see, right there. - Oh great. Do you have an online link? - No, you can't see it because the tapes were destroyed in a methane explosion. The car dealership was the site of a hog waste treatment plant. It's no longer around. So do you have anything I can, I can look at? - No. - Hi. Mr. Mastine, right? - Jamie Block. - Jamie Block. - Yes. Financial services. Have a seat. - Thank you. Thanks for coming in. First of all, very sorry to hear about your parents. Unfortunate. - Gas leak. - A gas leak. - Yeah a gas leak in the apartment. Yeah. - Sorry to hear about that. - Yeah, I mean, it's a real shame. But, it's also a good thing, isn't it? You know, because look, I got a shit load of money and you get a job so. - Let's get, maybe we should get down to the plan here. - Yeah yeah, let's do it. - Listen, the way I look at it, you know, you're talking about $3.6 million. I've got some really good news. I don't think you're going to have to take much risk at all, which means a very conservative barbell muni bond approach. All triple-a, all insured, we can have our muni desk, our institutional muni desk do it. This is going to be a really boring, wonderful, conservative portfolio. I, of course, will oversee it. And other folks here at the firm. - All those words. Boring, conservative. Look, I get the safe thing, investment securities, get the numbers going. I mean yeah that, that's all cool, but like, it needs some risk. It needs some spices and excitement. It's all about the excitement. - We could do with some inner emerging market stuff. With a small percentage. - What I'm really talking about is, um, Broadway show. I've always wanted to do a Broadway show. I've actually been working on it in my head. It's kind of like about the killing fields of Cambodia. - Traditionally, investments in the arts are bad investments. And especially in Broadway, so what I would recommend is we stick to the plan here, which is safe muni bonds. And avoid the arts. As far as investments go. - You are just like my parents. They never supported anything I did either, man. You are not a patron of the arts. How does that feel, huh, Mr. Boring. Well, actually, Mandy, believe it or not, I am a musician too. Uh, I was actually, I don't usually get into this in a first meeting with a client, but I was actually signed at Capitol Records. At a record, in fact, I did a record this last year. - I didn't get the job. - Do you think you could find somewhere else to stay tonight? No, probably not. Why? - Because I'm going out with Mandy and he's probably going to come home here afterwards. And it'll be awkward if you're on the couch. - Hi. Oh my god, you look so good! Oh, who's this guy? - He's a friend. - Oh, that's cool. - How you doing, I'm Onur. - Onur. - You must be Mandy. - Yeah, Mandy. - Nice to meet you, Mandy. - Oh hey, can I use your bathroom? My hemorrhoids are acting up. - Yeah, of course. You remember, right upstairs. - Yeah, thank you so much. - Did he just say his hemorrhoids are acting up? - You need to get a job and get out of here. All right, I came to New York to be a filmmaker. I'm going to be a filmmaker. - You're not a filmmaker. What films have you made? - I just need an opportunity. I need to get my foot in the door. He's a filmmaker? - I am a filmmaker, yeah yeah, yeah. - Hey that whole Super 8 camera thing, and you got the hat and the beard, and you're a real New York hipster filmmaker. That's cool, man. - Right, and you with your yellow shirt, you're a real New York something. - Isn't it about time for our reservation? - Well, yeah. Yeah it is actually. - Awesome, let's go. - Let's go, let's go. Oh, Onur, Onur! You know I actually met a guy who's looking for a filmmaker. He wants to do some like music videos and stuff, and he's actually, he's performing tonight. - Okay. I'm off to the show. - Okay. - No, I'm going to stay here. - All right. Well, listen, if you need me, call, but if you change your mind. Anyway, all right, I'm off. Okay. - Bye. * Henry * Is climbing a tall tree * In my memory * Let's do it again * He's high-oh * In the sky-oh * In the silo * Let's do it again * Do it again - Thanks man. - Great show. - Hey, thanks a lot. Thank you. - Hey man. Sorry, hey. Great show, great show. I really enjoyed it. Saw the whole thing, it was amazing. - Thanks for coming. - Absolutely. Were you doing, were those cover songs, are those originals? What was that? - No, that's the new record, White Caps On the Hudson. We played it, the whole thing beginning to end. - Then you played your whole album? - Whole record, yeah. - Brand new record. All right, well how you planning on promoting it? Like what's your plan? - I haven't figured that part out yet. Well, maybe I can help you out with that. Maybe I could be-- My name is Onur Tukel. I just moved up here from the south and I do music videos. I could, I think we could. Yeah, I could do a really good job. Like what have you done? - Lot of different things, a lot of different videos, a lot of different people. - Yeah. I mean, sure let me give you my card. - All right, great. Okay, hey listen, I got to go. - Let me you a question. Is there like a place around here that like I could stay? I need a place to stay for the night. I need a place to stay. - It's New York City. You can get hotel. - I don't really have much money though. It's like, you know what I mean? - There's cheap hotels too. - Okay, I got you. - Come on, I don't even really know you, I mean, please tell me you have a place to stay. And, I'll see you later. - Maybe I should get your contact information? - I'll e-mail you. All right? Okay. - See you later. See you, man. Take it easy. - Sophie, I'm home. * The sun is high * And baby is snoozing * The world is good, black-eyed Susan * Big white cloud up in the sky - Wait 'til you see what I'm looking at right here. - It's a dollhouse. This is a great dollhouse. - Dad, the other one was an original. - This one is Home Depot and it's 100% balsa wood. You're going to love this. Wait 'til you see this. - It's really, it's fine. - The original, people always say that all the time, that something's an original. It's just to get you there. - Yeah, Dad, I have to go. - All right, listen, I'll see you this weekend. - I'm not going to be here, I'm not going to be here. This is my weekend with you. I have a school trip, I told you. Where are you going? Dad, I told you where I was going. What's the first video? - My first thought is let's do this song, I'll Show You Mine. Let's do that song, and, you know, it's about, it's going to have dollhouses. Two dollhouses and a love interest, and we'll take it from there. - You want your first music video to be about dollhouses? - Yes, like miniature houses that you put, you ordinarily put dolls in. - It's not very rock and roll though, you know, I mean, we're in New York making music videos. They should be rock and roll. They should have attitude. I don't see a lot of attitude in making a music video about dollhouses. It's a little emo for my taste. - Yes, your idea. - Top of my head, Show You Mine, the first thing I think of because you want to get with the times and be like relevant, and funny, and puerile, and a little irreverent, is I'll show you mine, okay. You go into a public bathroom, you go to the urinal, you have to relieve yourself, you have to go to the bathroom, you have to urinate, you unzip yourself. The song's playing, you look over, there's another guy urinating right beside of you. He unzips himself and then you're singing the songs. He shows you his and you show you mine. - You're kidding me. - I show you, and you show me yours, I show you mine. * Come on, show me yours, I'll show you mine - You're kidding me, that's your idea for a video? - Daniel Tosh 2.0. They would find that very funny. - You're kidding me, I hate that idea. For a lot of reasons. - Okay, it's the first thing that popped into my head. I could probably think of a lot of other ideas too that are less emo than dollhouses, but you know. - Well, let's, listen, this is the first, let's do it my way, this one. All right, let's just do it my way and see how it turns out. * I don't know how * The sky is so blue * And why I can't stop thinking about you * But when I came here The guy is, what's his his hat? It's like Old MacDonald and his two toy farms. It's just cutesy. I mean the girl's hot. She's just, she's a real looker. Why is she with that loser? Dork. It's just not believable. I don't believe that. I don't believe this relationship. It's just crazy. * Show me yours I'll show you mine. - Oh God. This is pretty cool, don't you think? - Not really. - That's right. That's your first video. That's your first video. What you think? - I, dude, I dig it. - I dig it. - Yeah I mean it's especially the idea. I mean I didn't I can't believe she came up with those dollhouses. I mean I was picturing like the plastic kind you buy, you know, and she had two dollhouses. Not that! - I think that her dollhouses could've been made of sterling silver and made, God, Jesus could have crafted them out of wood, hand-carved them and it wouldn't have made a difference. I think it's really sappy and kind of cheesy. - In a good way though. - I don't think, no, I don't think sappy and cheesy in 2013 is-- It's sappy it's like it's got some heart. - You know, it's okay, it's sweet. I'll give you that it's sweet. It's like but in the 21st century we should be trying to make things that are edgy. We're in post-9/11 for God's sake. - We need dramatic grab though wouldn't you say? - When you grab her and kiss her? - Yeah. You directed this. - Yeah but I'm just saying, I just, I mean yeah and I think that I did a good job directing it. I think your editing is you know, 65% of it I really like. It's not horrible. You didn't do a terrible job. You did a decent job. - But you're responsible for the tone of it. - I, listen, the bottom line is, I just feel like we could do something a little bit more... - Emotion. No no we don't want, emotion, no. - Why would you want to take emotion away? This is something people are buying. They want to see something that has, you know, a little oomph. - The chemistry is pretty good with Jennifer and I, sort of. - Yeah you guys are great. It's terrific. I just think we should do something. - I think it's great that we should do something with the sense of humor and also maybe some of that's violent. We're in a very violent post-9/11 society where there is war happening, there are people blowing things up. There is a terrifying atmosphere that we're living in. We should make something that reflects. - The people that are going to watch this weren't even alive when 9/11 happened. You know I mean? They're seven. - They're seven. They like Twilight. They want things with emotion. - Twilight. - Wait a second. So you want more emotion. You say too much, you want more. - You just mentioned the word Twilight in context with our video that we did. I don't want to be known as the director that does, I don't think, do you like Twilight? - I love Twilight. Oh god, that's the movie my daughters brought me to. - I love it. It's got like, it's got a story and characters. - We should do the anti-Twilight is what we should do. With the next video we should do like hardcore vampires. - Pajama party! Who farted? Who's going to tell a secret? - One of my eyes was closed. We're best friends. What the fuck do I do? - Come in here. You're going to come in here. Okay, you're going to come in here and the girls are going to greet you. They're going to act like they're happy to see you. And they're going to, somebody's going to take the pizza. Does anybody have the pizza? - I'll take the pizza. - Samair will take the pizza from you. Everyone else is going to do whatever the fuck, figure out what you're going to do okay? - I'll take it. - Your vampires are going to eat him later. You're, you know what I mean? And you can have that confused look on your face. That won't be acting. - Everybody knows what they're doing except me. Do I, do I want to get out of here? - No you want to get paid. You want to get paid. - I know. I would naturally want to stay. - I think man you're excited. I think you're like, oh well, this is interesting. You know, I don't have to be anywhere for the next 10 minutes. - Let's not over think it let's just do it. - Then she's going to take the pizza you're going to be like, okay, but you're singing the song the whole time. You're a little bit nonplussed about everything but you're also a little bit cheerful because hey, this is a pretty good Saturday night. Normally you're not delivering to, you know, a bunch of nice girls. - Okay, this is nice. Good idea. - We're not going to see this are we? - I'm just taking in the whole. - But you're not going to see this stuff? - You say cut. May I ask you a question? For one second, for like 2/10ths of one second can you tell me what I'm doing? Because you're focusing all on them. - You're singing to the girls. You're a pizza guy now. You're flattered by the attention. - Like, give me some direction. - You're doing great. You're you're a little bit confused, I think you're confused and then you're like getting into it you know? - If I'm nailing it, I'm nailing it, but just just let me know if I'm not. Danny, what you think? You're all so cute. Nice diverse group. Very pretty pretty faces. - We're so pretty. - Corrupted souls but pretty faces. Go, go. Struggle, struggle. All right you gotta run tighter. So you need to get on Sanita now. Yeah that's good. Matt, look up at him, Theresa. Open hand right. Yeah gnash your teeth. Make eye contact with Teresa and Sanita. Look down at them. Sit down like we planned. Eat the pizza and fucking die. - No I think it's funnier if I come up and I'm like, hey guys, and then like they're all fucking dead. - I think that's right. Yes he's right. - No I wanted to I want to play it off of the spin. - This is better. The stake is dumb. - I don't care. Do it any way you want. I'm going to go. * Every time I think of a time * I said I can't believe any of us survived - Yes. - That's awesome, it's been like forever. - He's so my jam. - Wait, I, I swear I just read an article about him. Is he touring? - No it's, hold on. It's something really weird. - He's so good. Wait look, it's us! Oh we look good. - No look, you guys, look. Promising New York City songwriter Jamie Block now delivering pizzas to pay rent. At a restaurant in Midtown. - It's right there. - Dude that's that's right around the corner. - That's right here. * Every time I think of time * I said I can't believe * Any of us survived the days of wine * And unconditional speed * Moving to and fro, hither and yon * To succeed * Fame showered us with wealth * Baby from head to toe * Friends from coast to coast * Friends I didn't even know * But I could never grab enough * I could never feel full * The sun is high * The sky is massive * Nowhere to hide * No way to run away * I stumble to * The middle passage * So in case you'd like to know * How it was I landed here * With a one-armed go go dancer * And a half a case of beer * Feel like it happened over night * Give or take 40 years * You see I had this little plan * But the plan went off the rails * And all the friends that I'd amassed * One by one began to bail * 'Til I was sitting in this bar * No one left to tell the tail * The table's high * The check is massive * The locks are up and I'm walking to the door * I'll stumble through * The middle passage * So I stand holding a breath * At the precipice * In the middle of what came before * And hopefully what's ahead of us * Not at a slow decaying crawl * But an end stupendous - I like it. It's clever. I think it's cool. - Yeah really. - Great. - I swear. - Wow. Well I'm glad, glad you like it. I'm just curious, you know, I was in a really bad mood when we did it, so it doesn't really come across that I was. - No. - Because it was in the middle of the night. - It's not. It's actually pretty good. Who directed it? - This guy, this weird dude that I just met after the show at Rockwood. And he proposed this crazy project of doing a video movie thing for I don't even know what he was but-- - You didn't even know who he was? - No I never met him before. He came up from North Carolina. He's big in the used car commercial scene. - I mean I if I, 65% of you're editing I really liked on that. - All right, yeah. - On the video. Has he seen it yet? Because I still need to get paid. - No and that's kind of on you. - There she is. There she is. - Wow. - It's his daughter. - Daughter. She looks incredible. - Wow, she's really cute. - Maybe there's any videos that you need extra people. - Yeah. - It'd be cool. I mean, I can do it. - You want to be in one. - Yeah. - All right. Well we can ask him. He's coming as you know, so we'll see what he says. But I have no problem with that. - Sorry I'm late everybody. Sorry I'm late. - Oh hey man. - This is, you're Sophie! Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Wow I can't believe you're so, you're so pretty, wow. Hi little puppy! This your dog? - No no no. Someone in there. - It's, wow, I can't believe are you guys, like she's adopted obviously right? She's adopted. Is that kind of what this is all about? - I just think. - No she's my daughter as far as I know. - It's just so funny, it's so amazing. I can sort of see the resemblance, but you look like you could be on the cover of like. - I gotta take this call. - Oh yeah yeah, take care. - Hey guys. - Yes. - What's that all about, what's he doing? - Oh it's a work call. Work call. I thought... - Well he's like, he used to be a musician obviously. But now he's like a financial adviser broker. I was a part of the whole Occupy Wall Street Movement actually, and not that I really was that passionate about it. I just needed a place to stay and it was a free tent open, so. But I didn't realize, he must make some money if he's a money guy. We should up the budgets of these music videos a little bit right? You know? So he said you want to maybe be in one possibly be in one of these things right? - Yeah. That would be awesome. - That is, it's really really cool. You've done some acting before I take it? Or you're like... - No I've done stuff. Like I mean. You take acting class or whatever, acting workshop? - I do, but like I never been in anything legitimate. Do you know who Uta Hagen is? Uta Haagen Dazs was, she's a really terrific, she used to be an ice cream salesman. I'm kidding. She's a really great actress, she's really terrific. Know who she was? Stanislavski. De Niro is pretty good. Yeah I don't know. Yeah I don't know, I kind of, yeah I kind of like, I don't really work with the amateurs that much. And I feel it's like pulling teeth when you you don't have a dental degree. And I feel like in a way it's good that Block's funding all this even though he should probably pay a little bit more money since he makes the big bucks with the Wall Street thing. But I don't know, I mean, nepotism should only go so far. I feel like if you're going to be in these things that you would need some, I mean I don't want, I don't want, you need to have a little bit of training or whatnot. Why do I want to be an actor so much? You just want to show your pretty face, the YouTube generation just want to share, let everyone see you and say hey look at me, look at how special and pretty I am and all this stuff right? I don't know. - Maybe, I just-- - It's about the art you know, it's about the art of cinema. Sorry about that, I had to take that call. - Hey good, so did you make a money deal? Did you make some money? - We should up the budget on the next project I think maybe a little bit. I didn't realize you were a Wall Street guy. I didn't realize you were into that kind of thing you know? - Yeah well there's a duality to my, you know, consciousness. - Do you have is Ben Bernanke, do you have Ben Bernanke's number in that thing, you know? - I'm going to meet a couple friends. - I said I would meet a few friends. - We're sitting here having lunch talking about the video. - I thought we were gonna have lunch and talk about the video, I thought that was the plan. - I'm sorry. I wasn't. - We're gonna make you the next Brooke Shields. - All right. - I'm just, I'll see you guys later. Okay? - Bye. - Bye. She's really your daughter? - What the hell did you say to her? When I left, she's excited to be in a video. I come back and now she looks like she saw a ghost. What's going on here? - She's fine. She's nervous. She's just excited, she's so excited she didn't know what to do with herself. Plus there's that thing too, if someone gets around a director they get star struck and she's probably quivering and needed to get, she wasn't, you can't be around your father when you're quivering. She had to leave. Here's the thing. I think it's great, I got a great idea for the video. What we should probably do. - Is maybe going to the beach. Do a beach video. - Okay. I like it. I grew up on the beach. I like that idea. It's a good idea in the winter right? - I was thinking more this summer. And I was thinking that maybe we'd go to the beach. - Like Bergman, sort of in the winter kind of thing? - Yeah. - Sure. So what we do, but we'll be in the winter though. And I don't know if Bergman ever did anything with bikinis. But I thought she could come to to the beach with all of her friends and they're all in bikinis and they're all dancing on the shore. Ha ha, they're laughing and they're just, they're crashing on the shore and the music and the cameras panning back and forth, zooming in on everything. And then the water's hitting them, and they're trying to, they can barely keep their bathing suits up and the audience is like oh my god Block, I love Block! But they're not thinking about you. It'd be an amazing video actually. Her and her college friends would come up and they would just, this, great kind of thing you know? - Dude, dude, let me just explain something. She's not in college. She's a freshman in high school. - She's a freshman in high school? - Yes. - I thought she was in college. - These are supposed to be videos for my music. This is not not some, you know. - No no I figure you could be in the video. - Gratuitous sex. - No it's not gonna be sex. It's not going to be penetration. The thing is they're on the shore and then they're-- - No wonder she ran away. What are you, what did you guys talk about? - No here's the thing, they're cake mud dancing and you can be a referee. Like they're all dancing with the mud all over them and you come in. You're like, yo, yo, stop this! And then they just just like, they start punching you. In the face. - This sounds like a brilliant idea for a video. - I thought it would be very very like new wave and kind of forward. * 15 years since you went away * Lorado beach is not the same * I walked out past the promenade * Where all the pigeons congregate * If you could hear me now You don't have to say it, I'll say it. It's true. - Oh, it's okay. - I knew I could do it, but then when you're doing it you're like shit, you know, we're doing it. And we are. And you know we should be doing it. Don't you think? Like old times. It's kind of like. - Whoa whoa whoa. Uncool. What the fuck? - Governor, that wasn't uncool. We've already consummated. The first two nights we saw each other. - Yeah, two years ago. It's over. We had a fling. Move on with your life. - It's because of that Mandy guy? I can't believe you're. - Yeah I'm moving in with him and you need to get out of my apartment. - The guy is probably a sociopath. Do you ever think about that? He probably murdered his parents. - You're fucking crazy. Get your hobo shit and get the fuck out of my apartment. - So cool. Don't you love it? - Not really. I don't understand why you're the star of this. - I don't like it. I don't get it. - You don't get it. It's a, you've got, it's a meditation on time. The lo, and there's two lockets, two people. But they're really one person. But two lockets. - It looks like an anti-smoking PSA to me. - It's not done yet, man. That's the main thing. * Time is funny and it's strange * 15 years crashes from the waves And then he he walks off. You know? Yeah. Pretty nice right? Great. I think it's great. Make any, does it make sense? - No. - Doesn't make sense. You find, you find that chubby guy's locket and then you found his locket with his, it's got his. - Yeah like a switch of lockets. - And then he found your locket back a long time ago. Doesn't make. - It doesn't. - That didn't play off. - Does not quite work. - If it doesn't work then, you know. - I'd say, it's not that it doesn't work, I'd say it doesn't quite work. - If that's the case I mean. - If you know what I mean. - Glenn's the editor so. - I mean, can you make it so that it works? - I mean sure. The thing about my stance on the whole subject is I subscribe, I'm one of the only editors you'll meet that subscribes completely to the auteur theory which means that the director here is the one responsible. - Okay. Here's the thing is, it might be a little ambiguous or oblique but at the same time I think a more euphemistic term would be challenging. It's a challenging video. It challenges the audience and that's good. - So it's not that it doesn't work, it's challenging. - Also I listened to your record last night. White Caps on the Hudson? - Yeah yeah. You listened to the whole album? - The whole thing. What'd you think? - Very challenging. - We have bigger problems here. You need more money? You canceling the project? - No. No. But here's the deal, Sophie was in this video as you know, but now Johanna got wind of it and now she's upset. Now I have a second. - My oldest daughter, my older daughter. - Yes. I have another daughter. - Johanna. - She wants to be in a video too? She and the other daughter are competitive with each other and like daddy's attention. You give Sophie a chance to be in a video, now Johanna wants to be in one. - That's good. - Is that, I mean, that's natural. - It's a very good analysis. It's just natural. Listen, they both want to get into acting and stuff. - Sophie did a great job. - She did amazing. She's natural. But guess what? She's just as good. - You can't ask him if his daughter's hot. - Come on, it's not even funny. Is she hot? What does she look like? - Show us a picture. - Oh boy. * She's got a head on her shoulders * And her feet on the ground * And when I come over there's no one around * She'd already gone but there was a few things there * Like a note on the table and a ring on the chair * And some ice in the bucket and a picture of me * On a boat with Johanna in 2003 * And a book of Wallace Stevens open on the floor * And two glasses of red wine from the night before * Whitecaps On the Hudson * Whitecaps On the Hudson * So I turned my car around * I paid the toll again * I never called you * And I never called my friend - I want to shoot film on the next video that we do. - Great. We have been shooting film though, right? No, we've been shooting HD video. - It's just, it's what everyone's shooting on now. I think that we should take it to the next level and be like real artisans and shoot on film. You know, 35 millimeter, what the big boys used to shoot on. - Sounds better. - It's much better. It'll take us to the next level. Let's do it. We need more money, is what I was going to say. - Like 10 times more budget than we're shooting? No way. No. Okay. We shoot 16 millimeter instead of, that's a good medium as well to shoot on. Instead of 35 millimeter we can shoot 16 millimeter. And that's only like four times the budget that we've normally been shooting as well so. - Dude, come on. Onur look, let's do, I can't afford that right now. I'm not made of money. - The bottom line is, the bottom line is, we're doing these very cheaply. We're giving you really good product and I could probably get a job somewhere else at a production company that would allow us way more than even 10 times the budget to shoot film. So you got to think about this. We could all be doing, working other places making videos for other people. Then go do it. - I mean I, I, you know. - Then go do it. I mean that would involve you getting a job somewhere else. Have you looked in a mirror lately? - I mean. - You know, the hair suit, the clothes, it looks like you spent the night in the park. Dude, let's just keep doing what we're doing now, all right? - Yeah. - It looks great. Have you seen them? I mean I like and, I've got Inglesby coming in about two minutes, maybe one minute. You've got to get out of here. - Fucking fine, Inglesby. - Inglesby will be here now in seconds. What else do you need? Glenn, what did you say to me? - Nothing. You don't want to be here? - I mean, I've got other things to do, but-- What's the deal? What do you have? You came to New York to be a filmmaker, I'm letting you edit these projects. You know there's a learning curve. - I'm not editing right now though. - But you're going to edit you know when we-- - He's holding the boom box. - Yeah, well, you're props. - I just thought I was going to be doing more. - Well you're going to be you know, play back is very important on a film set. And also, this is different than the other projects that we've done before because this time we're shooting on film. You know what this is? This is a Super 8 camera. We're shooting on real film, real celluloid. It's not 16 millimeter, it's not 35 millimeter. But it's still pretty amazing. And you know, it might not be what they make the big Julia Roberts movies on, but it's still, you know, by the way we got better than Julia Roberts. We've got Block's daughter, Sophie and Johanna you know. If Shakespeare were here right now, he would probably write another thousand sonnets based on just the countenances of these two. - Agreed. You know, people. - So the plan is to shoot a Super 8 video. Keep It With Mine, is that what we're shooting? Yeah. - Beautiful song. What's the song about? - Um. - It doesn't matter. Let's start off with Johanna, I'm just going to shoot her for a little while. You guys take a seat and then we figure out what it is we're going to do regarding the song and then we'll go from there, okay? - Fine. - Okay, cool. Okay good. Give me a smile, give me a smile. Kind of twirl do a pirouette. That's all, that's really, really turning, wow, it's so great. Block doesn't deserve this video. I can't believe he made you, what's going through his mind? That's good. That's terrific. Oh my god that's incredible. Mesmerize. I'm mesmerized. I'm hypnotized. If it wasn't for this camera blocking us right now I wouldn't know what the hell is going on. - So Sophie, tell me, you're in high, how old are you? - I'm 14. - 14. So you do like the whole high school prom and like party with football players and stuff like that? - Not really. I mean Freshmen don't really go to prom. At all. - Yeah really. - You know when I was in high school, I also partied a lot with football players. - Yeah, I was, I was a football player. What position? - I played a couple different positions. Wherever they needed me, I was, they could throw me. They could basically throw me wherever on the field and. - Oh, well. - During practice. And you know, the whole team worked around that. So if you like that kind of. - Yeah I mean, Freshmen don't really go to prom and I don't really hang out with the football players. But they're cool I guess. Sports. Sports freaks. But not my thing. - Me neither. I never got into sports. - Oh. I thought, I thought you played football? - Just a practice situation. That's stressing me out a little bit. - The guitar playing. Noodling. I don't like noodling. - So great. Up up up the, oh my god that's incredible. That's very very terrific. That's so fantastic. Now you're going to, I want you to walk around circle. I want you walk around, I want you to like, you're kind of feeling your thigh and I want you to like, run your hands through your hair like this. And I want you to breathe in like the nectar of your armpit just smell it and just take it in, just this orgiastic, almost smell so good, and the pheromones of your own body are just charging you up and you're on fire. So you're walking and you, and you just do this and again put your hands to your hair and just take in the essence of your armpit aroma. It's so great, just do that, it'll be so forward and progressive and amazing, we can probably get it in the Chicago Underground film festival with it. - Are we supposed to be making a video right now? What's going on over there? Looks like a looks like a goddamn photo shoot for Vogue magazine. - Your arm up through your hair, through your, yeah yeah. Take that in, take it in, yeah. Tell it straight. It's a little pungent but it's still just so perfect and it's terrific. It's so great. - I'm going to go see what the hell's going on over there, all right? - Yeah. - Taking forever. - You know it doesn't always look like it, but the video editor actually has quite a bit of power in the whole grand scheme of things. - Rub your stomach in and you're just, you're pensive and you're unsure and you're uncertain. But God, you're so sexy at the same time. - Onur! I got to talk to you. - I'm shooting the video. What are you doing right now? - Hold on Johanna, one second. Listen. What the hell's going on here? I'm sitting over having a picnic and you're doing a Vogue photo shoot over here. This is a goddamn video of my song. What the hell's going on? - I'm not shooting Vogue video. We're doing something actually really existential and experimental. And you interrupted completely what we were doing okay? - Existential and experimental is not taking sexual, gratuitous sexual shots of my daughter while I'm sitting here over here, usually, it's usually. - Everything we've done so far has been clean, it's been digital, it's been pretty. - Typically you have a convention that when you're doing a video of a goddamn musician the goddamn musician is actually in the video. I'm going to get to that, okay? And the song! - And like I was saying, the video editing, it comes down to my direction in a sense? I can kind of like, I can change the video however you like. Maybe you come in and work with me on the edit a little bit and we kind of, you know, you know. Me and you kind of. Is that edit? Edit? - Listen do you want to be Duran Duran or do you want to be like Warhol? Velvet Underground? You know what I mean? Everything we've done has been so pretty. - Don't pull that Lou Reed comparison bullshit with me. I'm paying for this. What are we going to get out of these things? What have I gotten so far? I've given you six really really interesting, really cool videos. - But there's no cohesion to them! The whole concept you came up at Rockwood was they were going to have a concept that connected them. And it's way over budget and now I'm not even in the goddamn things anymore. You're right. Listen. I know what you do for a living. - I mean, I apologize, girls. I'm sorry you have to see your father behaving this way but it's time you learned right now the facts of life about what's going on here. I feel like I'm being exploited. What the hell's going on? - We're just. - Sorry! - Trying to make something interesting, okay? It's not my, if you're not happy with the videos Glenn's the one editing. - I'm not goddamn happy with them. - Glenn's the one, talk to Glenn. He's editing. - I thought you were some great filmmaker written up in the New York Times with all these great new techniques. As far as I'm concerned, I think you're a goddamn clown. - I was written up in the Taylorsville Times, and I'm the fucking clown? - You're a clown. - I'm the fucking clown. - You're a god damn clown. You know what, let's change the whole concept of this fucking video, okay? - Let's put you in the video and I'll show you who the fucking clown is. I'm not feeling like Polanski anymore. I feel like Fellini. You know who Fellini is? Yeah, let's do a little Fellini right now. You want to be in the video? It's all about you motherfucker, okay? Let's, you want to do a clown video? You do clown, I'm going to show you a clown video. - Listen, I just. - You want to see clowns, let's finish this video. We came here, you're spending the money, yes all this money, you're going to spend it, let's finish the video. And clown? - Great. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm asking! * The sun is high * And my baby's snoozing * The world's good * Black-eyed Susan * A big white cloud * Up in the sky * Is moving * Give me a smile * My black-eyed Susan - What I would like to see happen with this record is that it finds its audience. That with technology now, you can be very specific with how you market and how you find your audience. And there's people sort of all over the place that I think like this sort of thing and I'm just excited to see if they can find it and I can find them. See if we can find each other. - Hey Block. You suck. You really fucking suck. - Block, I know you're in your mid-40s and you're trying to make a comeback, but what are you trying to come back from, seriously? Like, I want to know who you were back then when you were with Capitol? No one knows who you are now, so instead of embracing what's in front of you and what's real, like your family, you're embracing this pipe dream that's never going to happen. - Go fuck yourself, dad. - In the name of all decency ever, just stop. Tear up your guitar, break your drums, never touch music again. Stay the fuck away. - Listen I've heard fucking rats farting to sound more mellifluous than your goddamn melodies. I'm only doing this because I have no experience okay? - Hey wake up asshole. You're investing your money in cheap music videos that no one will ever watch. - Wake up Jamie Block, has-been wanna-be rock star. - I don't want to be mean about this but you should stop. You should wake up. Wake up. Wake up. * The moon doesn't move * It just hangs in space * The floor's closing in * Where my footsteps pace * I don't expect to * See the sun again - Ah. I really like this one. - Yeah. Yeah I like the insomnia bits. I've got insomnia too, so. - I killed my parents. - I don't know what I'm doing. That's the truth. It's the truth. I don't know what I'm doing. I was doing this to get closer to my daughters and now neither one of them are talking to me. I don't know. Maybe this whole thing was just a waste of time. I don't know what the hell I'm doing. - Yeah you do man. This is an awesome video. I didn't like the others quite as much. But so what? Not everyone is going like everything. You're good at this. You should feel proud. Be proud. Be a man. * If you can * Be a man * That's some hopped up convertible bruiser * If you can * Pedantic man * Let me see your wristband * I got my tea time thesaurus * Got my pocket Ayn Rand * I am rugged and strong and very seldom have fears * While I'm tapping the maid while I'm drinking my beers * While I'm mowing the lawn and the wife is away * If I sing this song * Will make it okay * Ryan Gosling, Shia LaBeouf * Tosh.O fixing my truck * T.R. Pescod's scrubbing his feet * Sandra Hicks like a pie in the street * Jimmy Carville shooting off his mouth * Stephen Hawking figuring that shit out * Steve McQueen sidling up to the bar * That hippie won't piss to set himself on fire * Be a man * Be a man - That's my favorite part. - Look at that. Did you see that? We just nailed in like three and a half minutes everything that Occupy Wall Street was about. Just like that. - Your brother was incredible too? That Muhammad? Yeah. Or what's his name, Abdul. - Jack, his name is Jack. And it was really cool that we fortuitous, that I had an identical brother who came down from Turkey, cut his hair shaved his face. You know that was really nice. Patched things up between us too, we were on a kind of rocky ground there for a while because I had sex with his fiance's grandmother. But everything is perfect now. It's great. I think this is a really politically relevant video. - Absolutely. I mean the themes are super political. Super relevant. The haves versus the have-nots. - Have you ever seen anything like this? - I have not, no. - It's, I mean, we're sitting on a goldmine here. It's going to be amazing. You don't look pleased. You don't look happy. - I'm not pleased. I'm not pleased at all. And you want to know why I'm not pleased? I'll tell you why I'm not pleased. Because Glenn here has been inappropriate. Has been crossing invisible lines making them visible, contacting Sophie, my 14-year-old daughter, with texts, phone calls, flowers. You've done everything but hire a sky writer. Sounds pretty romantic, sounds like a good catch to me. You, you're really hitting that? - You know. Potentially we could be. - I've seen this look on your face before. You like this girl. - I'm happy, come on. I'm finally happy. - I sympathize. - I'm happy for you. - Thank you. - But in the meantime while you're happy, you're fired. What are you talking about? - You're fired. - You can't fire me. - I just did. - Block, you can't fire Glenn. - Yes I can. I need him to edit the thing. - You edit it. - I can't. Onur, will you talk to him for me? - You edit it. - I'm a terrible editor. You're overreacting. If you called Sophie, what did you do? You just called her. So what? I called her too to set up the-- - She's 14. How old are you? Me? - Yes. How old are you? How old are you? I'm looking right at you. - Right. I mean. - I don't know, you're asking me how old I am? - The person I'm looking at, staring at, I'm asking how old he is. - Look, in high school, people would always look right through me so there's not, just because you're looking at me doesn't mean you're looking at me. - Here's the bottom line. There's two things that are going on here. Number one, you're fired. And number two, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. - Block, that's a bad idea. That's illegal. - I swear to fucking god I'm going to kill you. - Okay. At least don't do that. That's a bad idea. - Wake up Block. Block, just wake up. - I'm going to kill you. - Block, just wake up. - I'm going to fucking kill you. - Block, just wake up. - I'm going to kill you. - Block, just wake up. You fell asleep buddy. Come on. Making music here. - Oh boy. Wow. Don't fall asleep on us now. We're back on. - That was weird. I can't Rip Van Winkle this now. We have got to finish these videos. - I guess I was tired. This is draining me, this whole process. - You know, working during the day. All day. And my family and driving and doing these videos. It's taken its toll. Maybe we should take a break. - Nah. We can't take a break now. - We were just talking about, while you were asleep we were just talking about how good these videos are getting and how we gotta build on the momentum. - Yeah, we have momentum. We're rolling down the hill opposite of Sisyphus. It's like full steam, it's like Sisyphus said, fuck it, let the rock just roll. This is the best video we've done. The next one is going to be even better. Glenn, tell them the idea. It's going to be incredible. - All right. Ready? Have you heard of - It's a Norwegian music video it's got over 300 million hits. People dressed in animal costumes making funny animal noises. We're going to do the exact same thing. Yeah. But to your music. With a spin on it. Which we're not quite sure what it is yet, but costumes, animal costumes, and you know, movement choreography. It's going to be terrific. It's going to be really alive. It's going to be sensational. - The idea aside, it sounds really expensive. How many people, how many costumes? And how many people? - I mean that's negligible. I mean how it's going to cost? Yeah how much is it going to cost? - It's going to cost, I mean. - It'll cost a lot. - It's going to cost a lot. So it'll cost a lot to recreate an idea that we didn't even think of. - Look, you want to scale it back. We have other ideas. - Great idea. We can do masks instead. Plastic masks. We can get. - Go down to the corner store, you know the party store. - That's scaling it way back. - Get a couple masks. - I mean. - Have you guys run around like idiots on the street. People love that shit. - It's a great idea. We get plastic masks and like, not just animal masks either. Gonzo. - Then we can do our own kind of version of it. We could do something with political masks we can do weird Halloween, weird scary masks. We can have a socio-political bent to it, come on feel me on this. - It would be like, all right, the duality of man. Right? All right, I like that. - We've got two different people, same masks, and they act differently. And they're all going at each other like this. And then all of the sudden Block comes in. And Block, what is he going to do? - And then at one point he's singing the song and he's like whoa, he looks over here. Oh and then they all start singing at the same time! - Oh that'd be great. That'd be terrific. That'd be amazing. - Guys. Guys. it's hard for, I'm getting stressed out just listening to this whole thing. Sometimes I feel like I'm the rope in a tug of war. I'm getting feeling pulled in a lot of directions here, that's the whole point I'm making. Work, family, this, I'm getting pulled all over the place. And I feel, I'm feeling schizophrenic. I don't know. - That's great. - We can use that. * Are you from Paris * Are you a sailor * How many women * No family * No past * All moments * He first hears water at seven from the mill flaw * Feeding raw cotton with the other children * Into the carding machine with revolving wire * Teeth picking lint and tying knots * Above machinery din and falling water * Mule spinning and falls jumping among * Pawtucket boys all jump the same * Feet first * Free falling * Staying under * Then shooting triumphant up to the surface * Friday November 13th * Come see Sam Patch's highest jump yet * The crowd was in place at one o'clock * They talked and shivered in the November chill * And then passed hats through the crowd collecting coins * Sam tried to relax * Sipping brandy from the bottle * Took off his overcoat * And climbed up to the rock protrusion * Sam lurched on the high high rock * And stared at the multitudes and mumbled * The leap at first graceful ended flailing, smacking body * Unfound till spring * Oh Spring, Sam Patch * My heart explodes, Sam Patch * Will you marry me, Sam Patch * Sam Patch * I have to go back to work * Patterson * The Passaic Falls * Grand beautiful sublime * Almost horrific and terrible spectacle * I am for Sam Patch * I'm for Sam Patch * I for Sam Patch Dad. Dad, what are you doing? Snap out of it. Dad? - I don't know what he's doing. - It's like a short circuit inside his head snapped. - I don't know. You want to go grab a hotel room or something? Stay away from my daughter. Stay away from her, leave her alone. - That punk. We got to go, right now. - Maybe I am losing it. Where'd he go? - I don't know what's going on man. I don't know. - Congratulations! You're a rock star, man. Take this. You did it. You're doing it. We're doing it. We've been doing it, it's amazing right? How do you feel, incredible? Exhilarated? - I don't know what's going on. - Making music, making music videos. You're a fucking rock star man. All your dreams are coming true. You're going to be on the cover of Rolling Stone, on the cover of Spin magazine. Maybe while they're still in print, while there's still a palpable paper edition available, you might be in it actually. But there could be a price to be paid, of course, to all this. Because check that out, look at that over there. That's fucked up. Maybe. - Come on man. - I think they're a nice couple. - I mean they're not exactly Polanski and Nastassja Kinski, but they're nice together. They're cute together. - I know it's crazy. - Come on. - It's not crazy, you're going to be a rock and roll star. Just strum strum, will you play me a tune? Play me a tune, play me a song Mister Piano Man. - Onur, Onur. Sophie come back here! Hey! He's nice too, I like Stephen. Sophie do you hear me? He's got that Dustin Hoffman thing going on. Sophie, can you hear me? - It's great. She can't hear you, she's in love. When you're in love, you're blind. - She can hear me. I'm her father. She can hear me. - You know music. - Sophie! - The music of love. - Sophie! - The music of love. - Sophie! - Dad! - Sophie! - Dad! - Sophie! - Dad! - Sophie! I'm right here. I'm right here! - I'm okay. Are you okay? - No. I mean yes. I don't know. - Okay well we gotta go, we're going to be late. Let's go. Back to my place. - Why are we going to your place? - Block, we got to editing to do. We got music videos to make. You know Block, doing this Block, doing that. We got a lot of content to make and that's what everything is about these days. It's content, content, content these days. You got to strike while the iron is hot. People want the content. - Yeah, timing is everything Block. - Timing is everything, dad. Dad, can I ask you a question? - Anything. - Making music. - I'm not Sophie but I like it when you call me Honey. - She's with me now. - With me. - Listen, I don't want to be one of these, what's so fucking funny? Sophie! Listen I gotta find Sophie. Sophie! - You know you have another daughter too. - True. But she's older. She can take care of herself. - I don't know about that. I'm 41 years old and I can barely pay my rent. I'm one paycheck away from going back to North Carolina with my tail between my legs. - Let's find Sophie right now. - No no no, let's make another music video. Have you heard the song? - No I haven't heard that. - You wrote this song. - My Head. Is it called My Head? Sing it. - There are pathogenic toxins leaching into corpuscle wide capillaries in my skull. The synaptic reaction is so subtle its existence is in doubt. My eyes are streaked vermilion. Where is Sophie? Where's Sophie? Where's Sophie? What the fucking shit? Where is she? Where did she, where's Sophie? - I don't know. Where is she? Sophie? Sophie! Sophie. Yeah. - We were just talking about your artistic goals and if you want to be a musician or not. - Not really, no. It's not really my thing. It's not your thing? How about acting? - I thought, I thought it would be my thing, but not that either. You know? - That's, it hurts me to hear that. You're such a natural, you're really, I really think you should continue to pursue it. You've got a real talent. I'd be more than happy to be your manager. - You're coming with me, little girl. - Hey hey hey. No no, she's coming with me. She's coming with me. - With me! - No she's coming with me. - With Sophie! Hey! I'm your father! - I'm her manager! And it's in her best interest to come with me. - I agree totally, it's in our best interest to finish this music video. Yeah yeah. - Sophie please. - Forget about the videos. - Come with me. - That's a great idea. Isn't that a great idea? You want to finish the video I agree. - I don't want to finish. - Keep moving. - I don't want to finish. - Keep creating. Like a shark swimming. If you stop swimming. - Forget the video for just a second. - Yeah. Yes. - Hey yeah I recognize you. I love your music. You do? - Yeah man. - Cool. Anyway, good to see you. - Thanks a lot. - Cool. * I could run far away * Or I could sit right here and stay * Whatever road * Whatever way when you're far away * You're far away * And the rain fell on the farm * And when I woke I was in your arm * You took me in * You like my song * When the rain fell on the farm - Second sticks. - Okay, the way we're going to do this Glenn, is that because this is 18 frames a second, it doesn't stay in sync, you're going to have to slate every couple of seconds. Every 20 seconds. I'll let you know when to slate, okay? But let's slate it again for the Super 8 camera. So get it over here and, Sterling we're rolling sound, right? Yep. - This is, hold on, one second not yet. Okay, go. Have you seen the video? Have you seen the videos? - I've seen all of them. Do you like them? - Yeah they're awesome. That's good, right? Why do you want to be in the videos, Johanna? Why, do you just want to compete with your sister? You don't like that she's getting the attention? - Yeah, we're in huge competition.
