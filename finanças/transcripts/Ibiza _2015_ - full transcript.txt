IBIZA ﻿Rakash, if I don't come back in 15 minutes, ﻿call the police. -No problem, sir. ﻿I go now, I call the police, I come after 15 minutes. ﻿No!

Maybe my friend now... ﻿Rakash, just don't do anything, stay here and don't move. ﻿5 days earlier in Israel ﻿Looks like God is with Yam (sea) today! ﻿After catching that wave, no more swells in the region! ﻿You're Yam's brother, right? ﻿Can you take our picture? ﻿Surfing, my friends, surfing! ﻿Finally. ﻿I can't take it anymore. ﻿I'm bored shitless all day. ﻿Nausea, "Mindsweeper." ﻿I'm about to leave and I get 300 pages to file. Stat! ﻿So, do you love me? ﻿Where's Eran? ﻿Flirting with Rona. ﻿That's it, Chimpanzees, ﻿Yam makes it to the championship finals next week! ﻿I told you so. This is the little leagues, ﻿you should go international. -Yam! Yam! Yam! ﻿All the girls want a piece of Eran. ﻿You get your tickets? ﻿How could I if you haven't decided if we're going to Ibiza or to Spain? ﻿And his mom's a travel agent... ﻿Ibiza is in Spain, you white ass test tube. ﻿I'm liking what I see so far, ﻿everybody, keep it up! Let's go! ﻿Nice! ﻿Let's do this 8 more times. Go to break and we'll be right back! ﻿Gilad Yankelevich? Really? ﻿spend a few more bucks, join a Vipassana retreat. ﻿But I'm not going, Junior. ﻿Dad, Tell Yam that I'm going with them. ﻿Going where? ﻿To Ibiza. ﻿What did you say? -Ibiza? ﻿Maybe he should give Joshua a call? ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿Last time I saw that anti-Semite ﻿he aimed a semi-automatic at a blind 72 year old lady. ﻿Grandma Miriam, ﻿what an amazing woman. ﻿Who's Joshua? ﻿Your father's brother. ﻿What? -You have a brother?! -No! ﻿When the kid says "with them," he means Eran and Daniel, right? ﻿One interns at an accounting firm ﻿and the other's studying medicine! ﻿"Studying medicine!" ﻿Tell me, besides inheriting my good genes, ﻿and your mother's, what else have you accomplished? ﻿How about surfing with me some time. ﻿What do you say? ﻿We'll get him a surfboard from Chapa... ﻿You won't regret it. ﻿And if you'd let me get a word in b ।	a s-- edgewise ﻿I'd tell you that I qualified for the national surfing championship finals. ﻿Way to go! ﻿That's amazing! ﻿Did you hear that, Tova? ﻿Your son qualified for the national nebbish championships! ﻿Good for you! ﻿Now you're a top notch nebbish! ﻿Listen, you do what you want, ﻿but don't drag your little brother into that hogwash. ﻿Fine, whatever. Let's go, Junior. ﻿Isn't it about time you opened your mind? ﻿He doesn't earn the food he eats, what are you going on about?— May I? ﻿"Sunsation White." ﻿Once a year, all the world's top DJs ﻿get together for one night of rapture in Ibiza. ﻿This is the truth. A heart's desire. ﻿Whoever's been says it's a once in a lifetime experience. ﻿And then they go back. ﻿There's my balls... ﻿Hey, you dick, what's up? ﻿Ah... ﻿Wow! This crap is delicious! Who brought it? ﻿Me. ﻿You mean Emma didn't make them? ﻿Even her omelets taste like bottled water. ﻿Yam, we going in? ﻿Did you wax the board? ﻿Did you replace the fin, adjust the leash? -No. ﻿Then tell me when you're done. ﻿What's going on here? ﻿There's oil in it so it goes straight to your head. ﻿Yam, I'm done. ﻿Asaf, how about surfing without me today? ﻿You said I can only go in with you when the waves are high. ﻿I also said that dolphins should live on land, so what? ﻿At your age I was charging the waves, ﻿be a pal... ﻿Pu... pu.. ﻿He's trying to say, don't be a "punani." -What's a "punani?" ﻿Vagina, Asaf. "Punani" means vagina. ﻿Does this hurt? ﻿Sweetie, don't worry. You'll be fine. ﻿Doctor, how's my son? ﻿He has to undergo surgery in 10 days. ﻿Oh no, there goes New York with the girls. ﻿Sir, the surgery will cost 10,000 dollars. ﻿It's not covered by your health insurance. ﻿If we don't operate, he might have a permanent limp. ﻿Like "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," nothing serious. ﻿Are you insane? Of course he'll have the surgery. ﻿Of course, sure. ﻿Doctor, this is our son, Yam. ﻿He's responsible for Asaf's injury. ﻿He's the one who took him to the beach, abandoned him in the raging sea, ﻿he's the one I told not to mess with the boy! ﻿You want him to have surgery? Cough up the cash. ﻿No problem. get the cash. ﻿What did you say? ﻿I said I'll get the cash! ﻿I'm telling you, ﻿take your eye off the ball for a second and life throws you a curve ball. ﻿Fucking Slim Fit. ﻿Okay, talk to me, where do things stand? ﻿Are you serious? Nothing? -Cut it out. ﻿I don't have the money and I can't ask my mom ﻿coz she's paying for my studies. ﻿This generation sucks their parents dry until they're 60. ﻿What? Don't look at me, I'm way overdrawn. ﻿Did I tell you I took Emma to a cabin up north? ﻿You'll just have to surf in the finals. ﻿Isn't this what you've been dreaming of, practicing for? ﻿Im not gonna surf anymore, I can't. ﻿I'm on sick leave starting Sunday, you hear me? ﻿You know what? ﻿If we get the money, I'm coming to Ibiza. ﻿Hi, sweeties. ﻿What's shakin'? -Nothing. ﻿Wow! ﻿Oh my God, look at all those people! ﻿Those buggers make tons of money from those parties. ﻿Reminds me of festivals of days gone by. ﻿Jacarepagu,? Rio de Janeiro, ﻿Me, Nelson, Mitchel, Jack, Slav, Donovan, Richard... ﻿Sol°mon and PauL ﻿All of us in one tent... ﻿on the green grass. Love in our hearts... ﻿I couldn't walk for 2 weeks... Mom! ﻿Do they have to hear this? ﻿He's so sensitive. ﻿Hey. ﻿Bye, Mrs. Pshutin, have a good trip. ﻿Your daughter is in good hands. ﻿Emma. Emma is in good hands. ﻿Bye, Mom, have fun. ﻿Ibiza speaking, bitchin' party here. -Bye, Dad, have fun. ﻿That's it, the eagle has left the nest. ﻿How great that they just left, huh? ﻿Yam, that lucky bastard. ﻿Listen, dude, you trash the house, it's on you. ﻿Why are you ticked off? -Me? ﻿When my boyfriend would rather go away with his friends and not me? ﻿Baby, come on, be a sport. ﻿Your boyfriend wants to chill out ﻿from all the stress 24/7 ﻿and all you can think about is sex. ﻿You'd never open your house up to a party ﻿so that I could go "live my dream" in Ibiza ﻿and sniff panties all day. ﻿All the women are men snatching whores. -Emma, ﻿you can't take it back. You agreed, don't start in on me again. ﻿"Touch-move," that's all there is to it. ﻿Think of it as another phase in our relationship. ﻿As a constructive phase. ﻿"Constructive?" What am I, a builder? ﻿Get off these stupid arguments already. ﻿Do you even love me? ﻿Give me Jager. ﻿Now he's in the hospital. ﻿Poor thing. ﻿You're such a sweetheart, have a drink. -No, thanks. ﻿Is there anything we can do? ﻿No. ﻿Actually, if you each have... ﻿200-250 bucks, that would help me so much. ﻿What? How rude! ﻿No, Eran, no way. ﻿What are you? A 5 year old? ﻿We learned that urine causes hair growth. ﻿Then pee on your dad's head. ﻿Yuck! ﻿Hey, man, look. ﻿He looks like Tai Museri. ﻿Shall we go back to your place, baby? ﻿We can play sexy accountant and horny secretary. ﻿What's wrong with you? You drink oil? ﻿Where are Yam and Eran? ﻿Eran! Eran! Eran! ﻿I don't get it, you really don't remember a thing? ﻿Ask me again, it won't help. I said no. ﻿Luckily Eran is studying medicine, he bandaged me up. ﻿Is this what it's going to be like in Ibiza, God forbid? ﻿Ibiza? ﻿We used to go to the Sinai, 3 days naked in the sun, ﻿me and Gitzi used to take off... -Rafi! ﻿What did I say? ﻿I was talking about the trips. -Sshhh. ﻿"Good morning, world, ﻿"how is everyone today?" ﻿Come on, get up! ﻿Why'd you bring me here? ﻿We made enough money last night. ﻿I gave it all to Garcia, the gardener. ﻿The 2015 national championships begin! ﻿All surfers to the water line. ﻿Listen, Yam, you suck. ﻿Not you again. ﻿I wouldn't sign you up for the national girls competition. ﻿What's wrong ﻿You sea sick? Chicken. ﻿Shut the fuck up already. ﻿Some of us were in the army... ﻿some of us were top athletes ﻿who scratched Kelly Slater's balls in Australia. ﻿The waves don't come to those who don't paddle. ﻿What a kook. ﻿Listen, dude, I've got this situation here... ﻿you know what I mean, right? ﻿Gimme something. ﻿Let's hear it for the 2015 national champion! ﻿Bravo! ﻿Bravo! Bravo! ﻿Chapa, how about an envelope with some moula...? ﻿Forget the envelope, you're the national champion, man. ﻿"Moula" he says... ﻿Well, loser, you get the cash? Can I talk to the doctor? ﻿Wait, you had that party, how much did you make, 1,200? ﻿And that medal, you can sell it for 12 shekels. ﻿How much more after that? ﻿Nothing, really, just 9,987 dollars. ﻿Surfing. That's where the big money is. ﻿Buy cheap, ﻿sell high. ﻿Get off my case already, go away! ﻿Listen, go to this website, ﻿www. goldenwave... ﻿Your life's just peachy, huh? ﻿Yeah, peaches and cream. ﻿It's after 12:00, you know what that means? ﻿That 7 years ago to this day I saw in between Rona's thighs? ﻿What a day... She dropped her pencil case right in front of me. ﻿I meant that this is the first of my sick days ﻿and I can't get them back. ﻿That's how it is in the adult world. ﻿You come here to bust my balls? I have enough on my mind. ﻿"The Golden Wave competition in Ibiza is open to all, ﻿"with the finest young surfers from all over the world. ﻿"The surfing carnival is the perfect combo of surfing, parties, ﻿"young men and women and everything in between. ﻿"And this year too the winner will be granted ﻿"a gold bar worth 150,000 dollars." ﻿I've signed you up. Start packing, we're going to Ibiza. ﻿Besides, Rona will be there too. ﻿Eran, do me a favor go buy me a giraffe. ﻿Where do I buy a giraffe? ﻿It sounds awesome, guys, but... ﻿I don't think so. Surfing is not for me anymore. ﻿Besides, since when are there waves in Ibiza? It's bogus. ﻿You wanna argue with them? Once a year they must get some waves. ﻿Not for you? You're the one who's always talking about signs. ﻿How do you explain the fact that we learned about the fuckin' 150,000 today? ﻿They're swimming in cash over there. Pizza costs 200 Euros! ﻿One day after "Sensation" we come back. -Bro, please, let it go. ﻿Listen man, Emma wants to get married! ﻿I'm gonna marry her because no Ibiza? Is that what you're telling me? ﻿How will I get it in? ﻿"The height of a giraffe's shoulders is 3 meters off ground, ﻿"Its color is brown-yellow with large, dark patches. ﻿"Its coat pattern serves as camouflage from its enemies in the Savannah." ﻿I can take that mutant 24/7 here at home, ﻿but overseas, no way. ﻿Get outta my way. ﻿Your mom's awesome, arranging business class... ﻿Who wants barbequed burgers? All we gotta do is fire up the grill. ﻿You brought meat to the airport, you moron? ﻿You gonna barbeque in here? ﻿My mom put them in my bag, lay off me. ﻿I wouldn't mind. ﻿You screwed up too now? ﻿You don't do anything illegal on a trip that could get you 10 years in jail. ﻿Daniel, we're on our way to Ibiza, just like you wanted. ﻿Don't we deserve some snacks? I'm hungry, so what? Wow, this is awesome. ﻿Can I get some more bread? ﻿The taste of happiness. ﻿Are you going to eat that? ﻿Please. -Thank you. ﻿Whoa, try the humus with the cake. ﻿It's scary. ﻿Everything okay? ﻿What about Rina, don't you want to make a move? ﻿I do, but what if she says "no?" ﻿There go my future prospects. ﻿And without a future, what is the future? ﻿It'll change everything. ﻿You're crazy about her for years and you don't even know her. ﻿At least try to talk to her. ﻿Time doesn't stand still. ﻿Suddenly you're 30, with a kid, poop, pee, Minny Mouse diapers. ﻿You were... ﻿blessed with the only love that's real. ﻿Love at first sight. ﻿It's classic, bro, no technology, no corporations. ﻿Don't take it for granted. ﻿You know what? Fuck it all. ﻿There you go, dude, release the beast. Focus. ﻿Focus, release the beast. Focus! ﻿Come on, get up, there's a party 5 minutes away. ﻿Look at all these babes, motherfucker! ﻿Now? It's only 10am. ﻿No, tomorrow. I wanna get laid. Get up already. ﻿Okay, now us, okay? ﻿I'll let my husband's mother in with her contagious psoriasis ﻿before I let you in. ﻿You're good for nothing. You don't understand the culture. ﻿Fuck. Three nights, you know? Three! ﻿Stop, let nature take its course. We'll get in eventually. ﻿It's so hot. I feel like a pita with humus. ﻿You're the guys who were wasted on the flight. What? -Me 30! ﻿Everything okay. They're with me. ﻿Thanks! ﻿I'm Daniel, this is Yam and this moron is Eran. ﻿Menashe? -Menashe? ﻿What does he want? ﻿What? ﻿You don't remember me? I'm Josh. ﻿Benny's brother. Your super cool uncle from Ibiza. ﻿You're Joshua? ﻿Menashe? -Yes, Menashe. ﻿Everytime it was "Where is Menashe?" "Menashe's at the beach." "Where's Menashe?" "At the beach." ﻿"Where's the kid?" "At the beach." ﻿We started calling him "Yam." ﻿I don't believe it, look at you, you are a man now. ﻿I haven't seen him since he was the size of my ball, the small one. ﻿Follow me, okay? ﻿Menashe? ﻿You see this? ﻿For 3 years I was living in an avocado orchard, ﻿waiting for my commandant to pick me up. ﻿One morning, a truck of Colombian farmers came by. ﻿They told me the war was over 23 months ago. ﻿That's when I decided to swim to Ibiza ﻿so I can party until I forget. ﻿In my first week here I got into a fight with a blender. ﻿I lost 4 pounds of blood. ﻿I imagined it was avocado juice coming out of my body. ﻿Look, Ibiza is no home. ﻿The madness, the drugs... it can be too much, ﻿if you can't handle it. ﻿No, I'm here... as a tourist, I'm chill. ﻿And to think I was about to offer you ﻿some girls, some parties, ﻿the Ibiza lifestyle. -Damn straight. ﻿Maybe even a job, if you like the big money. ﻿Actually, Josh, I'm here for a reason. ﻿I came to surf. ﻿Girls, drugs, parties... I don't really care. ﻿Never underestimate a woman's power. ﻿A woman parks, a woman runs you over. ﻿True. ﻿Now, pick one out and go dance a little. Trust me, it will do you good. ﻿Go, dance a little. ﻿Menashe, take this so you can always know how to find me. ﻿Girls are very, very important. Very. ﻿Yes. ﻿Are all Israeli men as tense as you? ﻿I have a lot of responsibilities. ﻿Where are you from? -Hawaii. ﻿You wish. We all do. ﻿I'm from Italy, but I'm flying to Hawaii soon. ﻿Maybe I'll come with you. ﻿Why not? I'll be your arms bearer. ﻿My name is Jennifer. ﻿My name is... name... ﻿Yam. ﻿Yam. ﻿Maybe you want to come to the beach tomorrow? ﻿Maybe. ﻿"Alexandra 24?" ﻿Hey, sexy... -Hey. ﻿So... what do you study? ﻿Study, huh? ﻿Yes. ﻿What? No? ﻿Grandma's naked. ﻿Grandma's naked. ﻿Grandma's naked! ﻿Give money! ﻿You have this... ﻿Ibiza, Ibiza, Ibiza... ﻿Hey. -Hey. ﻿Can we? ﻿Yes? ﻿Yes? -Yes. ﻿Yes! Yes. ﻿So... ﻿You are from here? ﻿What? ﻿Hey, hey... ﻿Rich man's whores. ﻿There is no such thing as true love. It's all about money. ﻿I tend to agree with you, but I'm telling you... ﻿Let's go, I want to get up early tomorrow. ﻿Where's Eran? He went to take a piss hours ago. ﻿So? We're in Ibiza. He's a big boy, I'm sure he's fine. ﻿Hey. ﻿You pay? ﻿I don't... what? ﻿I don't understand. ﻿She your girlfriend? ﻿No? ﻿Whoa! ﻿You finally got here! ﻿Sir, is all this yours? ﻿I met this girl... ﻿You meet a whore, bro? ﻿My ass is showing! Yam, get me down! ﻿Eran, I don't know if we can, ﻿you want us to let you loose here? ﻿You'll traumatize the kids, the pregnant women, the elderly... ﻿Get me down, Yam! ﻿You don't have to understand everything. ﻿Look, ﻿Yam, ﻿this is you, this is the wave. ﻿You come from here and give it to him. You see? ﻿No, he has to paddle in this angle, it's simple math! ﻿I'm telling you, he comes from here and gives it to him! ﻿But that can't be right! What about specific gravity in the water? ﻿How about not being a gefilte for once in your life. ﻿Watch out I don't specify your eye, you twad. ﻿Yeah, right, violence, that's your solution to everything. ﻿"Your solution?" ﻿Spray me with some DDT, why don't you. ﻿You tool. ﻿Yam, don't listen to this idiot... ﻿Welcome to the only relaxing spot in Ibiza. -Wow. ﻿You real|y Me living in lbiza, huh? ﻿Something in the air makes you feel free. ﻿"Ma ra?" Sure, no worries, why not? ﻿Ra-ra. Like a chicken. ﻿You asked me what I find in Josh. ﻿Come. ﻿When I was a child, my father took me surfing all the time. ﻿He didn't care if I missed school or anything, as long as I was happy. ﻿That's how he was, my dad, a free spirit. ﻿You see, my dad, he had a small surfboarding place, ﻿just like this one. ﻿The "Flash"... ﻿Probably the most radical board there is. ﻿It's either the best surfboard you'll ever try or the worst. ﻿There is no other way. ﻿They say only a true soul surfer can handle it. ﻿You sound like the surfing penguin from the Disney movie. ﻿To be honest, I don't think I can surf tomorrow. ﻿My brother almost died because of me, ﻿I pushed him into this whole surfing thing. ﻿I feel as if it's not meant to be for me anymore. ﻿Come with me. ﻿What, now? Are you serious? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿This is what you call a "move." Look and learn. ﻿"Learn"... Not as if it'll help you. ﻿What? Explain. ﻿Eran, you're... ﻿How can I say this without offending you? ﻿Look, for people like me, life is not a porn movie. ﻿I have to work hard to get some hottie to sit on my nose. ﻿Yam... his life is a German pom film. ﻿And for people like you... ﻿it's an Arab documentary, in black and white. ﻿You're way down on the food chain. ﻿You have to make peace with the fact that you're not in the game anymore. ﻿I know, Yam explained it to me. What has to happen happens. ﻿I guess your destiny is to only be with Emma. ﻿Shut up, you moron! ﻿Go, get some more ice cream, I hope an eagle snatches it away. ﻿"Only Emma..." How rude. ﻿"Not in the game," huh? ﻿Hello, Chica. -Hello, Gwapo. ﻿Good. ﻿So, what are we drinking? ﻿400 Euros, 20 minutes, no anal, no sagi-sagi, okay? ﻿Only fuckin' sheikhs screw around here! ﻿What happened? ﻿We're out of gas. ﻿Don't worry, someone will come soon, okay? Keep cool. ﻿Don't have too much fun without me. ﻿Go find him. ﻿Bye. ﻿What... ﻿What's... going on? ﻿You got this white spot. ﻿Are you going? ﻿Sure... yeah... I'm going. ﻿See, I'm going. ﻿Where are your girlfriends? ﻿Those divorcees? They're at the beach all day ﻿looking for Brazilians to hit on. ﻿You know, things that happen abroad stay abroad... ﻿What about you? Are you... ﻿What? ﻿I need a man. ﻿That limits your options. ﻿I mean a real man. ﻿Not someone I have to hit on. ﻿Someone who can read between the lines. ﻿Who'll take the reins. ﻿Who'll make a move without thinking. ﻿I'm kidding. ﻿What do I need? ﻿I need some thrills. ﻿I'm on vacation, I want to let loose. ﻿I'm always loose. Loose... ﻿A true cuckoo's nest. ﻿No one knows the real Rona. ﻿My mom always says everyone is a bit Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. ﻿Totally. ﻿Ibiza is beautiful. ﻿You're beautiful. ﻿Yes, it's very beautiful here. ﻿Ibiza... ﻿Well, I'm... going that way. ﻿I'm seeing... I'm meeting... ﻿See you at the Sensation? ﻿Could be. ﻿Hey, Baywatch, you out of gas? ﻿The pump break down? ﻿So, you ran away overseas. ﻿I'm rigid, you flow. ﻿I'm matter, you're water. ﻿You're stuck, Yam, stuck! ﻿You have no backbone, your skeleton is rotten. ﻿Nothing personal, huh? ﻿Yam, there's no point. It﻿'s all for nothing. We cannot break. ﻿Welcome to Ibiza! ﻿"Golden Wave" 2015. ﻿First group, right now! ﻿Damn, where is that clown? ﻿Where have you been, you tool? ﻿I'm here now, that's what counts. ﻿Dip the sausage. ﻿You did it, ah? ﻿Daniel, you're letting life take you to the dark side. ﻿That woman is a dream. ﻿Here we go! ﻿Yam, you've got this. -Round one! ﻿For Asaf. ﻿You've got this. -Ready... Set, ﻿Go! ﻿Yam! Yam! Yam! Yam! ﻿Yam, show those faggots who's boss! ﻿Sshhh... Don't you get that's an international word? ﻿So what did I say, Nazis? ﻿Italianos. ﻿Pizza... -Pizza, pasta... ﻿Pasta. -Pizza, pizza, pizza... ﻿Are you guys hungry? ﻿Pasta... -Pizza... -Pizza. ﻿Rona! ﻿Vardi? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿What am I doing here? What are you doing here? ﻿I heard there's a "kooks" competition so I signed up. ﻿This is my 7th year in a row, get a grip. ﻿Remind me how you placed in the nationals? ﻿I hope your surfboard cracks, you loser. ﻿Go blow. ﻿What do we do? ﻿I don't have another surfboard. ﻿I'm screwed, I can't believe it. ﻿No sweat, I can sell my collection of Darth Vader dolls. ﻿And I'm getting a return on the B a tax write-off. ﻿Well manage, bro, don't worry. ﻿Yam, get one from Josh. We have a winner! ﻿What do you find in these guys? ﻿Look what they did to the house. ﻿Has he even said he loves you? ﻿That's not fair, he's emotionally withdrawn ﻿but I know how he feels inside. ﻿I dated Yam for a while too. ﻿Tamar, that was in 3rd grade, and you went out twice. ﻿Yes, Emma, but it stretched out over 4 months. ﻿Okay, can I tell Pitchhada to bring his friend? ﻿What do you care? Give it a try. ﻿You really think Daniel isn't partying with all those girls over there? ﻿Of course he isn't, he knows that would be the end of us. ﻿Forget those Georgian rich guys. Is money the only thing you care about? ﻿We're not 17 anymore and I have to secure ﻿my financial future. ﻿I'm going. You wanna come, come, if not, so not. ﻿Pitchhada can be European too. -Right. ﻿Hagai! Come here boy. ﻿Yuck, what's with his hair? ﻿He smells like acid. ﻿Hagai, who's my hot doggie? ﻿I told you, dreams only come true in Ibiza. ﻿You were right, bro. ﻿We're close to the sun here. ﻿Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun. ﻿What was that? ﻿Icarus had wings of wax, he got too close to the sun and fell into the sea. ﻿It's this Greek thing about a man's soul. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿You're single, yes? ﻿Why? ﻿Because you have a big silicone valley... ﻿What...? ﻿Grow up already. ﻿I'm dying to pee. ﻿Pee on him like you did on Emma's dog. ﻿Tell me you didn't do that. ﻿That was a good one, and he was so happy... ﻿Hey, I forgot to get chocolate for Asaf. ﻿Hold this. The gold's in here. ﻿"Slim Fit?" ﻿Wasn't he killed in battle with the "Upper Taker?" ﻿Dude, I can't move, he put a spell on my legs ﻿like he did to his rivals. ﻿So, you think my girlfriend is plastic, huh?! ﻿No, no, Mister Fit. ﻿There's been a terrible misunderstanding! ﻿He's hitting our shopping bags. ﻿Get the fuck outta here! ﻿Hey... ﻿You see "Slim Fit?!" ﻿Thank you. ﻿What did you do that for? ﻿He started. ﻿Watch over the gold. ﻿Put on your shirt so you don't blind the beefcake. -Sure. ﻿According to Murphy's Law, you'll get the skankiest masseuse. ﻿My money's on you. ﻿Don't make me laugh, I only get the Playboy bunnies. ﻿How are you? ﻿Johnny. ﻿Hello. ﻿Someone loves me too much. ﻿What is this? ﻿Where me? ﻿Hello? ﻿What is this? ﻿This isn't fair. ﻿Hello? ﻿Mommy! ﻿Cinderella, I'm starving, it's Friday! ﻿Let's go already! ﻿Hold your horses. We're not all rich like you, ﻿some of us are trying to look good to get Rona. ﻿To get Roma. ﻿"To get a hot chick, do as the Romans do," ﻿it's a phrase the players use. ﻿"Rich guys like you"... ﻿Where's the bag? Hey, Eran, you got the bag, right? ﻿What am I, a 4 year old, don't you trust me? ﻿I was just asking. Calm down, man. ﻿Okay, I'm ready. Zeisel? ﻿"Sensation White." Damn! ﻿Listen, you go, I'll join you later. ﻿Why not come with us? ﻿Because... "Why?" What?" "How?" "When?"... ﻿Leave me alone! ﻿gotta life besides you guys, you know? ﻿Your entire world doesn't revolve around me, okay? ﻿I guess he wants to jerk off. ﻿Have fun. ﻿Where's the bag? ﻿This is aspirin... ﻿I have a headache. ﻿Is this okay? ﻿More and more people are kidnapped in foreign countries ﻿that you won't ever hear about. ﻿It's increasingly becoming a crime of concern. ﻿We're being singled out. ﻿Tourists, small businessmen, journalists ﻿targeted for kidnap abroad. ﻿Asaf, ﻿how's it going, pal? ﻿How are you? -Partying big time, man. ﻿You still in pain? -Yeah, no big deal. ﻿What's with you? ﻿Not much, just wanted to tell you that God's with us. ﻿No way! You won? ﻿You're kidding, right? -I swear, 150,000. ﻿Now I'll have surfboards for the next year? ﻿The next year? The next decade, you moron. ﻿But Yam... I'm not sure I'll be able to surf, I mean... ﻿Why aren't you returning my phone calls? ﻿Your brother's in a wheelchair because of you and you run off to Ibiza? ﻿Benny, lay off me, okay? I'm not coming home. ﻿Don't worry, the money will be there on time. ﻿Is this any way to live, Yam? ﻿You wanna teach me how to live? ﻿You wanna tell me when's the last time you had fun, ﻿the last time you did something that made you smile? ﻿What do you know? ﻿Oh, and I met your brother, Josh, he sends regards, ﻿and he's ten times more successful ﻿As you can see, your daughter has been kidnapped. ﻿It's not me, it's... peer pressure, ﻿it's me being disappointed by who I am. ﻿If we don't get 150,000 dollars by tomorrow, ﻿she's history! ﻿No, no! ﻿How long does it take to make pizza, dude? ﻿In Hebrew we say, "Your sister's in a cast." ﻿"Your sister's in a cast." -Yes. ﻿No, you say, "My sister's in a cast." ﻿"Your sister's in a cast." ﻿Okay, go, douchebag. ﻿Very good pizza, gracias. ﻿There you are, is your right hand clean? You use up all the soap? ﻿Everything's A-Okay. ﻿Where's the music, you know, to dance, move the body? ﻿Eran, what did you do? ﻿Nothing, it's cool. ﻿I found a way to get the money back. Okay? I got this. Bon appetit. ﻿I love you guys to death. ﻿You're my brothers. Love. One unit. ﻿Who's gonna give me a hug? You? ﻿Where's the money, Eran? Where's the gold? ﻿Who cares about the gold! As long as Asaf gets his operation. ﻿Once I dissected a frog. ﻿Money is no more than a means to an end. You ever give any thought to the soul? ﻿"If the sun comes out... ﻿"It's a sign..." -Eran, focus! ﻿Where's the bag? ﻿I lost it, I lost the bag, but I have an idea. ﻿I solved... ﻿I don't believe this! ﻿I don't... Are you serious? Tell me you're serious. ﻿For real? ﻿I don't believe you lost... ﻿Check, please! ﻿Yam, forgive me, but you're not yourself. ﻿What do you want to do? -What do I want to do? ﻿Let's go see "Swan Lake," I hear they got a new ballerina. ﻿That's a great idea! I didn't know you're into that. I... ﻿I'd show you my video cassettes, ﻿I took classical dance for 4 years and modern dance for two. ﻿You think you know someone, you go on vacation with them ﻿and you discover magical sides and that... ﻿that his name is Menashe! ﻿I am going to slice you up, you eggplant! ﻿Thank you. ﻿Yes, police? ﻿No! ﻿No police, no. It's okay. ﻿It's a game, okay, not real. You see? Me good. ﻿Okay? ﻿Bye, thank you. ﻿Hello. -Hello, we're here to see Josh. ﻿You can't. ﻿It's fine, I'm family. ﻿Alright. ﻿Yam, we shouldn't be here. ﻿We're no criminals and this will end badly. -I don't care. ﻿Money doesn't give money, listen to someone who's been around. ﻿Tell him, I got it all worked out. ﻿You worked it out? God help us. ﻿Yam, you know Justin Bieber? ﻿He's absolutely awesome. He's a genius, eh? ﻿He is the John Lennon of the generation. ﻿Girls, you met Yam, he's the only family I got. ﻿Except you, of course. ﻿"Baby, baby..." ﻿Josh... ﻿Joshua! ﻿I need to speak to you. Alone. ﻿Of course. ﻿Raul, fix these two gentlemen a drink. ﻿You served in the army, right? -Yes. ﻿That's the only reason I can trust you. ﻿A guy like you must have been in some special campaigns. ﻿Yeah, of course. In Israel everything's "special." ﻿You know, like two chocolate bars for 5 shekels? ﻿4 popsicles for 10, 3 Bazooka bubble gum for 1 shekel? ﻿Okay, this is a unit. ﻿Nothing compares to a good campaign ﻿with your unit in the army. ﻿Yes. -Rito Carlito. ﻿The man killed 10 people in one shot. ﻿Bieber. ﻿So, all you have to do is give this to my friend. ﻿He'll wait outside the party. You can't miss him, he's huge. ﻿And he'll wear... what's it called... ﻿A gold chain with a big lion, okay? ﻿10 thousand dollars, cash tomorrow morning. Luck. ﻿Yam? Yam.. ﻿What? ﻿I'm sorry, okay? ﻿It wasn't what it looked like, trust me. I keep thinking about you. ﻿Trust you? ﻿You're just like every other girl. ﻿I finally fall in love and it's with someone like you. ﻿Ciao. ﻿Think about it, 10,000 dollars in a suitcase. ﻿Bro, this is not the army and we're not an army squad. ﻿It'll end badly. ﻿He look like a soldier to you? You know where he was assigned? ﻿Assistant quartermaster... -Shut up, you idiot. ﻿This zone is a bad force. No place for a Jedi. ﻿Yoda said that too. ﻿Do you get me? -Daniel, gimme a break! ﻿He's not your brother, is he? ﻿You wanna come, great. You don't, that's good too. ﻿Just do me a favor, stop busting my balls ﻿before I have you do squats right here and now. ﻿I can't even get an "Energy" around here. ﻿Forget that, I have something better. -There he goes the 2nd exemplar. ﻿What? Talk to me, let's hear it. No, you know what? Let me guess. ﻿You lost my wallet? ﻿Don't you say a word! ﻿There's a thin line between courage and stupidity. ﻿What's wrong, Daniel, you scared? ﻿Scared to leave Emma? ﻿All we gotta do is get down in the gutter and float back up. ﻿If anything happens, I'll take the heat. ﻿Okay, Punani? ﻿What's that? ﻿Caffeine pills, I took one earlier... ﻿It made me insanely sharp. That's why I said I figured it out. ﻿Did you find the gold? ﻿I got this idea from "Battlestar Galactica." ﻿Eran, shut up, ﻿before I send you to the hostel ﻿to give me five fingers??? and come back. ﻿You know what your problem is? -Emma? -Overweight? ﻿Only I can straighten you out. ﻿What have we come too? ﻿Where's the guy? I don't see the guy. ﻿You see a lion around here? ﻿You must have misunderstood, I bet he meant the entrance. ﻿Let's split up and find him. ﻿I can't believe a squirt like you will one day be a real man. ﻿Mommy. ﻿What will become of him? ﻿You'll be a loser. ﻿This is my room. Wow, it's pink. ﻿I love you. ﻿I don't know what to say, you took me by surprise. ﻿Don't worry, you won't say it anymore. ﻿Curiousity killed the cat and trauma killed the rabbit. ﻿Didn't you know? -What? ﻿No? Then smell this. ﻿Slim Fit Vader from the farmer's market galaxy. ﻿Why did you get messd up with him? You ruined my life. ﻿Why doesn't God intervene? ﻿Stop, you sound like Arkady Duchin. ﻿Who's that with him? ﻿Slim Fit is here with two beefcakes. They're gunning for us. ﻿How am I supposed to look for the guy? My dad has a moustache. ﻿I just told Emma that I love her. ﻿Arkady Duchin used to be Russian. Emma's dad is also Russian... ﻿He got pissed when we broke the crystal at the party, ﻿so he sent his friends over here to take care of us. ﻿Everyone wants to kill us! ﻿In the sand I am the man! -In the sand I am the man! ﻿Louder! ﻿You guys hungry? ﻿Yeah. ﻿What's in the suitcase? ﻿He said not to open it. ﻿Then we won't. ﻿Is he for real? ﻿I'm such an idiot. I don't believe this. ﻿Let's go over there. ﻿What's up? ﻿You look as if someone told you MacDonalds is shutting down. ﻿We're going to see Josh. ﻿As you can see, your daughter has been abducted. ﻿A strange video has surfaced today which police is convinced is a hoax. ﻿"It's not me, it's the peer pressure," cries the kidnapper ﻿and the world fears a new terrorist cell from Ibiza. ﻿We don't know who the clip is for that was distributed on YouTube. ﻿The question is, is this a real abduction ﻿or just a hoax that spun out of control? ﻿Can't bro have a minute to eat? What's the rush? ﻿"Bro?" ﻿My brother will be in a wheelchair for months because of you. ﻿Not to mention I hope we're not about to go to jail. ﻿There he goes again, thinking about himself. ﻿Why did you want to come to Ibiza? ﻿Huh, Daniel, why? To help me? ﻿To get me money? No. ﻿To screw someone other than Emma. ﻿It's not my fault that that's not where I am. ﻿You finally found someone who loves you, ﻿God knows why, and you wanna screw around ﻿coz you're afraid of feeling good. ﻿You're disgusting. -Did I say you could talk? ﻿As if you didn't fly half way around the world just to talk to Rona. ﻿At least if you would have, but every time you see her... ﻿"Bros," so long. ﻿If we don't get 150,000 by tomorrow ﻿she's history! ﻿What is this, the Gestapo? ﻿This is his mother. ﻿Where's my daughter? ﻿You tell me or I'm going to the police. ﻿Excuse me, Sir, who are you? ﻿We don't negotiate with terrorists, you hear me? ﻿I ain't got no cash. ﻿Forgive me, Starsky and Hutch, ﻿I don't know what you're talking about. ﻿Your punk son stole my princess! ﻿Listen to me, you won't see a dime! ﻿My money's tied up in stocks and bonds. ﻿40 years, 3 exit points. ﻿Now I remember. ﻿When he was 3, he stole a tangerine from Pauline. ﻿I should have suspected then. ﻿Well, in the meantime have some refreshments. ﻿It sharpens the memory. ﻿Is it real or a dream, is it reality or fantasy, ﻿parallel worlds... ﻿Two hours a day, Yankelevich, ﻿that's all you need. ﻿You get a hard on... ﻿like Titanium. ﻿You remind me of Jeannie and Mickey. ﻿We spent a whole week on the couch in Seattle. ﻿They didn't let me get dressed. A real amusement park. ﻿Hi. What are you doing here? ﻿The room is dusty. ﻿Get in. ﻿Rona? ﻿Rona, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. ﻿I lost 150,000 dollars, I didn't know what to do. ﻿Rona! ﻿I've been waiting for this for a long time. ﻿You have? ﻿Yes. ﻿Just don't tell your friends, okay? No one must know. ﻿Why? ﻿Eran... ﻿you're fat and horny. ﻿It's embarrassing. ﻿What? ﻿Hello. ﻿Hello, hello! ﻿"Hello, hello!" ﻿Where's my fucking suitcase? ﻿What, you don't speak English now? ﻿Where is my fucking suitcase?! ﻿Eran... ﻿Someone told me it's a good place to relax. ﻿Hawaii? ﻿No, I decided to go back home and finish my degree. ﻿So you also have a flight to catch. ﻿Yup, back to doing nothing. ﻿In the real life I'm a nobody. ﻿Anyway, ﻿I need to take care of something before I go. Josh, you know... ﻿I was supposed to give it to his friend but I couldn't find him, it was a mess. ﻿I wouldn't mess with Josh when it comes to business. ﻿What business? He made a mistake, there's nothing in there. ﻿Do you really believe Josh would let you deliver an empty suitcase? ﻿I'll show you. ﻿Okay. ﻿Josh, what's up, bro, it's Yam. ﻿Now listen to me, you little piece of shit. ﻿You have 3 minutes to bring me my fucking suitcase back. ﻿Otherwise your friends are my property. -What? ﻿He's lost it, bro! The man's insane! ﻿Three minutes, my place. ﻿I told you. ﻿Fuck me. ﻿It's a sign. ﻿The final sign of freedom. ﻿Jenny... ﻿Let's fly to Hawaii. ﻿What? No, but Josh... -Josh is not a killer. ﻿Trust me, I saw killers in my life. ﻿Surf and love. ﻿Hawaii? ﻿Let's go. ﻿Hello. ﻿Tell me... ﻿surfing and all the... ﻿what's so good about it? ﻿Every wave has a purpose ﻿and every question has meaning. ﻿Keep it real, man. ﻿Not everyone can surf. ﻿You gotta connect, it's the only way. ﻿You remind me of my wife. ﻿Do you rent out surfboards? ﻿No way. -No? ﻿I sell them for a few hours then people bring them back. ﻿The first sale is free, go for it, ﻿but it doesn't include VAT. ﻿Gilad Yankelevich? ﻿What the fuck? ﻿I don't believe it. ﻿I'm going to marry this beautiful woman. ﻿Yam, is everything okay? ﻿No, nothing is okay. ﻿Rakash, can you take us back to the city? ﻿I can take you to Mumbai, as long as you pay. ﻿Let's go, we don't have much time. ﻿What are you doing? -What I need to do. ﻿I have to save my friends, even if they're stupid. ﻿Jenny, ﻿I'm choosing to do and not letting karma or some other boss decide for me. ﻿I need you with me. ﻿Rakash, go, go! ﻿No... ﻿Relax, sexy. We're not going to hurt you. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I followed you because I wanted to apologize. ﻿I love your horniness, ﻿I love this water bed that you call a belly. ﻿Yes, you're chunky, but you're what I've been looking for ﻿and I never felt as free as I do with you. ﻿I'm not ashamed of you. ﻿I'm ashamed of myself. ﻿Eran, ﻿you're my Luke Skywalker. ﻿All you have to do is say the magic words. ﻿Just say, ﻿"fuck me." ﻿Fucking shit! No way, I love my girlfriend. ﻿If I die today, I will die like a man. ﻿This isn't your first time, huh? ﻿I think it's better I stay here, you go. ﻿If I see... ﻿"Where is Yam" after 15 minutes, I'll call the police. ﻿Good idea? ﻿My idea. ﻿I swear Rakash... Buddha. ﻿Forgive me for the mess, Josh. ﻿This is not how I wanted it to end. ﻿You know, they say Bieber was performing, ﻿full concert, solo, with his guitar, ﻿when he was only 7 years old. ﻿How do you explain it? ﻿Hard work, maybe? ﻿Not at this age. ﻿What is it then? ﻿You know, some people are meant to do something in life. ﻿They're like a predator. ﻿Like my captain in Afghanistan. ﻿He could kill in seconds, ﻿but he never kissed a woman. ﻿So what does a predator do when something gets in his way? ﻿He releases my friends, ﻿because otherwise he won't see his suitcase again. ﻿You know, this is funny. ﻿What's so funny? ﻿That the son of the same guy who never ate avocado ﻿because he was afraid of the cholesterol ﻿now thinks he's negotiating with me. ﻿At least your brother had the guts to be a father. ﻿What the fuck? ﻿Raul, ﻿tell Bubik and Rocksteady to bring me Nikita and the two pussies. ﻿Some friends on Facebook ﻿told me I have a daughter in Costa Rica. ﻿A father means being with your kids, ﻿making sure they do something with their lives. ﻿I should have known. ﻿I'm sorry it didn't work out, man. ﻿Trust me, I need that money more than you can imagine. ﻿Hey, hey, get the fuck out! It's not a Bar Mitzvah. ﻿And do it quick, before I change my mind. ﻿Run... ﻿Menashe!! ﻿Go! -Go, Rakash, go! ﻿Are you okay, bro? ﻿Mama Jukara, this is for you. ﻿Go, go... ﻿I almost slept with someone. ﻿I almost cheated on Emma. ﻿Shit! ﻿Skywalker's boxers, they're in the hotel. ﻿Don't worry, we'll find you something on the way. ﻿That's from "Call of Duty", right? Intense. ﻿I will never see Hawaii. ﻿I will drink your blood, Menashe. ﻿Police? I want to report a huge drug deal that's going down. ﻿Ten minutes in the airport. ﻿Bald guy, red suit, black suitcase. ﻿Where's my money? ﻿Rakash, I love you. I love you with all my heart. ﻿Motherfucker! ﻿So, Mr. Josh... In the end we meet, huh? ﻿Yeah, happy ending, yeah? ﻿Yeah. Depends what happiness is to you, Mr. Josh. ﻿I see. ﻿Wait, if Josh doesn't have the real diamond... ﻿Choosing your actions is awesome, but doing the right thing... ﻿is greatness. ﻿You jerk, you got a hamburger for yourself? ﻿From now on when you have a question, write it down and throw it away. Retard. ﻿I'm a retard? You illiterate fool. ﻿He can't even spell the word. And you wanna be a doctor. ﻿Oh yeah? ﻿I-I-i.. ﻿So I guess this is it, huh? ﻿You have a special soul. ﻿You will find your true other half. ﻿What is meant to happen, happens. ﻿He had her for sure. ﻿Where's your sense of romance, Don de Ie Shmate? ﻿Baby? ﻿Baby! -You almost gave me a heart attack. ﻿What's going on, you freak? ﻿I love you, Emma. ﻿I don't know where all this is going, ﻿but I love you now and that's all that matters. ﻿Me too. ﻿Who told you I'm coming back? ﻿I didn't even know you're back. -Then why are you so wet? ﻿Asshole! ﻿What do you think?; ﻿Where are they from? ﻿They're yours. ﻿There we go. ﻿I got an awesome wave down south, I'm outta here. ﻿But first, I have another surprise for you. ﻿This is for you, okay? ﻿Let Dad pay for the operation. ﻿CNN? ﻿Okay, okay. ﻿With an estimated value of over 50 million dollars, ﻿the "Blue Glory" is finally back with its legal owners, ﻿thanks to this down on his luck surfer from Israel. ﻿Yam Cohen was thanked in person by the princess of Spain ﻿with the medal of heroism, the highest honor the Spanish nation can bestow. ﻿He also received a sizeable cash reward ﻿for the capture of Interpol's most wanted man, ﻿The Avocado Ghost." ﻿What's Ibiza gotta do with me? ﻿A slave to life and to Yankelevich. ﻿Trying to get clean. ﻿Because sometimes you have to exit through a door, ﻿let loose, flow with nature, that's all there is to it. ﻿I think. ﻿Benny, you starting again? ﻿Take it slow so you don't pull us back with you. ﻿Chapa, you fiend, what's going on? Relax. ﻿See you in Hawaii. ﻿Loser, you bring the cookies? ﻿Translation: Tammy King ﻿Subtitles: Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
