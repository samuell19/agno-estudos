You're already playing. Have you finished studying? -Yes. -Good. -[bike engine stalling] -That sounds broken. [boy] Yes, it is. Who's winning? Where's Mr. Dindo? He's there! Fooling around. -Grace, have a drink! -It's still so early. -[man grunts] -Auntie, how's your business? -[man] I told you to move! -[elder woman] It's a little slow today. [Dindo] Go ahead! Go ahead! This is mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mr. Dindo, you're too big to play with them. Is it my fault that I'm so tall? How's Mom? Any problem? I visited her earlier. I think she's okay. Thank you for being thoughtful. No problem. Auntie Tina, can I borrow corned beef and noodles from you? -[Tina] You're in debt. -[Grace] I'll pay for it. [Dindo grunts] [Dindo] Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Let me go! You little demons! Mom, I'm home! We're running out of medicine. Was your trip tiring? Not really, Mom. How are you feeling? I'm okay, my child. Here, Mom. Take your medicine. Where's Christian? He's in the kitchen. -I think your brother's hungry. -Oh, okay. Mom, here's your water. Christian, I'm here. [Grace] You know what, Christian? I've brought you something. Here it is, Christian. Christian. Christian. Oh, Mom, I bought corned beef and noodles. Can you cook it? Yes. I can handle that, my child. Are you sure? Yes. No problem. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving, Mom. -Okay, take care. -Okay. -Grace? -Mom. I'm sorry for being a burden. Mom, don't say that. It's fine with me. Your recovery is more important. -I'll go now. -Okay. Bye, Christian! [engine revving] Good afternoon, sir. The Evo has landed. Evo, how the hell am I going to ride on that thing, wearing this? And please, change your clothes. We're going to a recital and then you're wearing that? Hey, babe. You're so sexy. Stop it! Let's just stay here instead of going to the recital. Hey! Hmm. So are we going to go or what? -Mr. Dado. -Yes? Get the car ready. Evo and I will ride there. What? Akiko! Nanny, could you prepare Evo's suit? He will change his clothes. No way! That's itchy! I won't wear that. [classical music playing] [Evo grunting in discomfort] Akiko… Evo… Good you guys were able to come. -Nice suit, by the way, Evo. -I agree. [chuckles] Come. I'll introduce you to my friends. See? I told you, you look good in that suit. [violin playing] Yes! Yes! [Evo clears throat] Yes. You're really good! You're really good! Bravo. Bravo. [upbeat music playing] [drunk man] Wow, man! [boy] Wow! [grunts] Hey! Wait! She's rude! Rude! -Man, it's embarrassing! -I'm a customer here! -Who are you anyway? -That's enough! Girl! Girl, what have you done?! It's good Balat saw you and not our boss! If not, she'll get mad again! Did you see what he did? He made a move on me! Oh, no! It shouldn't be like that! What were you thinking? Do you know of any other jobs? Hey. This is a miracle! You're interested in my work! But you know, later, after our shift… I have an extra job. I need one more! -Do you want to come? -Really? What is it? A stag party. You need to wear sexy clothes and dance. That's all! It's an easy job! Yes, I know! But I can't do this kind of work! It's difficult for me! You know how to dance, right? And that's all. No touching. They won't touch you. And Dindi's also with us! -Hey! You're coming later, right? -Yes! -I'll beat you if you don't-- -Yes, I'll come! Did you bring our costumes? Yes! Everything's ready! All three? We already have costumes! Come on. -Let's go! -I can't do that. -[Evo muttering] -[child chuckling] So there you are. Akiko. The show's over? Yeah. Let's go? -[child grunts] -[Evo grunts] Bye. She has a boyfriend. -Whatever! -Don't force her. She has a boyfriend but where is he? He's in the U.S. We don't even know if he's coming back. He's not even calling you, right? You know that. You know that. You know that, right? Come on. Come with us. Because you know what, friend? You're going to waste the opportunity if someone else gets the job. Because your mom's sick, right? You need money for medicine. And in this life… You won't earn this kind of money anywhere else. It's so easy! You're just going to dance! You know how to dance! She knows how to dance. Yes, I saw her. Why? How much would I earn? Girl, it will definitely convince you! [boys] Whoo! Banzai! [boys cheering] You can do it! [boys cheering] I can't do it anymore! I'm already drunk! Hey, Jun! I know why you're getting married. -Why? -So you'll have your mistress! You're always playing! Man, you don't have any girls! -Where are the girls? -What time is it? [bell buzzing] -They're here. They're here. -They're here. -Move! Move! Move! -They're here! They're here! -[door closes] -[laughs] She's so fair! She's so beautiful! So flawless! So big! Ah! [laughs] Whoa! [Evo] Pizza! Pizza! Whoo! Hey, man! Jun! -Are you sure you're getting married? -Yes, I'm sure! No problem! Condolences, bro! [laughs] I thought Akiko didn't want you coming here. Me? I can't miss these things! Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. We won't tell her! It's okay. Where are the girls? Yes! What time is it? Man, what time is it? -Man, look! -[door buzzes] They're here! -Come in! -They're here! Come in! [door opens] -[seductive music playing] -[boys cheer] Hi. Did you guys order for room service? -Yes! -[all] Yes! Just a minute. We're bringing your order. There you go! Hurry! Man! Man! The lights! Sit down! -Here it is! Here it is! -Here it is! Here it is! Man, here it is! [girl] Grace. What, Grace? Are you ready? You've been drinking! -Are you ready? -Yes, I'm ready. [boy] Turn the music on! [upbeat music playing] Here it is! -This is it! -Here it is! Here it is! -[sighs] -[boy] Woo! The top is off! Man, pick that up! Here's the main event! Here it is! There it is! [boys cheering] Grace, are you okay? I'm okay. Okay. Can you see that? Go to the groom. That one? That one? Man, I'll just get my cell phone. Hurry up! You'll miss this. This is great! Oh! [lady] I think Grace is already drunk. I don't know. She was drinking before dancing. Whoo! What kind of a dance is that? Could you dance a little better? Dance some more. [boys cheering] Evo! Evo! [indistinct chattering] [boys jeering] [laughs] [boys groaning] -[grunts] -[music stops] What happened? Why did you slap me? I agreed to come here because they said no one will touch me! Do I look like I'm cheap? That's the reason why we paid you. What's this? You think you're good-looking but you're not! -Pervert! -You know what--- You girls are useless! -Just be cool. -[door closes] If that girl comes back, I'll show no mercy! [Grace grunts] What did you say? -That's enough! -What did you say? -What now? -You're not even paying us! -Where's our talent fee? -Talent fee? -Yes! -Here! Here! Here! -Let me have that! -You're looking for this? -[bundle thuds] -Pick it up! You really want war, huh? That's enough. -[Grace kicks] -[Evo shouts] What now? [Chicky] Bye! I said, let's go! [Evo] You're amazing, man. You even came to pick me up. Man, I'm different. I have a VIP pass. [chuckles] Wait, bro. Why are you walking like that? What happened? I had an accident at Jun's stag party. Stag party? Does Akiko know? Who said she knew I even went? Oh, no. Prepare for Akiko. You know what, Evo, you must behave. Man… Tell me these things when you have a girlfriend. Who said I don't? You have a girlfriend? Who is she? Mom, here's your medicine. It's good for two weeks. So there's no reason for you to be sick. And Mom… Here. Why do you have money? Where'd you get it from? I had another job, Mom! Work? What kind of work? Oh, it's… That's… I let her sell a cake. Since she sold it, she made some money. What kind of cake? A delicious and big one. A lot of people enjoyed it. That's why she got a big cut. Thank you, Chicky. Of course, anything for you! Because Mom, you know what. I have a new job. But it looks like Grace doesn't want to go. -Too bad… -Shut up! I'll hit you! It's really such a waste. -Mom, I'm leaving. -Okay, my child. -Take care, okay? -Yes. -Chicky, take care of Mom. -Go. You're too talkative! -I'll go now. -Take care. -Go. -Bye. What now, Mom? What do you want to do? Do you want to belly dance? Mom, you've been drinking all day! Whatever! Don't bother me! Give me that drink. Come on. You're thinking about daddy, aren't you? I don't give a damn about that bastard and that whore of his. Give me my drink, Evo. Come on. Here, Mom. This has more effect. Evo! Give me my drink! [door opens] Ma'am, it's Madam Akiko. -Oh, hey! -Oh, hello, Akiko! -Hello, Auntie. How are you? -I'm fine. How about you? -I'm good. -You want a drink? Hmm, no, thanks, Auntie. Akiko, what are you doing here? Can we talk? Akiko, what are you doing here? I thought you had work. I've had enough. I know what you did during the stag party. Akiko, I was just having fun. Having fun? Well, here… -[chain clatters] -[grunts] Now, you can have all the good times you want. [slow music playing] Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, while not causing environmental factors… -Grace. -…can greatly be influenced by them. -A chaotic and structured-- -[bell rings] Okay. Class dismissed. -Ah, sir. -Yes? I need help regarding my thesis. Grace. Mark? Grace. -How are you? -When did you arrive? Just yesterday. -Did you miss me? -Of course. Let's get something to eat. [Mark] Beef Misono and Pork Tonkatsu. Sir, Tokyo Bestseller or Sumo meals? Sumo Meals is okay. You know what? Finally… Our deal with the franchise owner of L.A. is closed. Maybe we'll sign next week. It took a while before we were able to close the deal. I thought you'd already forgotten about me. You've been in America for a long time. [Mark chuckles softly] No. How's your mom, by the way? Does she already know about us? Oh. Why are you sad? I'm sorry, Grace. I'm just waiting for the right time. Grace… Why are you still sad? Okay. This is what I'll do… I'll introduce you to my best friend. I'll bring him to your bar tonight. Is that okay with you? What? Damn you, Jun! Why did you tell Akiko? Sorry, bro. Slip of the tongue. You know her. She's good in investigating. Good thing I didn't let her see your video. What video? Jerk! You already have a sex scandal! Man, you better delete that! [chuckles] Delete, huh? Delete, huh? Here's to you. [grunts] Bro, what's that video? Let me see it. Nothing, man. It was recorded from the stag party. [giggles] That's why Akiko broke up with you. You're really an asshole. Man, she was just fired up at the time. I can still get her back. Just watch. We'll still be together. Man, when I introduce you to Grace, don't be arrogant. If not, I'll beat you. Man, I might steal her from you. Don't do that, man. -[message alert] -[clicks button] [exhales] Jun is really crazy! Let me see! Let me see! -Wait! Wait! We might have an accident! -Just let me see! Later! Okay. Later, okay? -You might feel bitter. -[Mark giggles] [seductive music playing] [lady exclaims] So handsome! Why do we have to meet your chick in this kind of place? This is where she works. As what? Chef? Oh no. A waitress. Oh, a waitress. Oh there she goes. -Come on. -Man, she's sexy. That's a compliment. A compliment. -Do you need anything sir? -Ah, Grace. [Grace] Hmm? [upbeat song playing] This is Evo, my best friend. Hi. [chuckles] Have we met before? You look familiar. No. This is the first time we've met. Are you sure? Of course. What time is your shift tomorrow? The same. -Okay. We'll go out. -Okay. Girls, sexier. Dude, you know what? Let's eat here. Uh, Grace. Do you have a cake here? A big cake. [giggles] Okay. I'll check. -Look for a table, okay? -Okay. [jazzy music playing] -[door thuds] -[grunts] [sighs] [screams in frustration] [Chicky] Come on. Let's keep in touch. Hello, Kitty. What's wrong, bagoong? It's Mark. He introduced me to his best friend. -Guess who? -Who? Evo! The asshole at the stag party. Evo! What kind of a name is that? It sounds like a car. -[sighs] -What happened? Did Mark find out? -I don't know what he said-- -[Evo] I didn't tell him. [mellow music playing] Thank me for not telling Mark that you're dancing nude. -I didn't dance nude! -And… that's me! That's my work. You like me? I'm cheap. Chicky! You know what? I won't tell Mark for now. But I'm telling you this. Don't you cheat on him. Hmm? -Nice. -Hey, you pervert! [scoffs, blows kiss] See! He's so rude and perverted! Yes, he's a pervert! But I like him! He's so handsome. [grunts] [elevator dings] -"I'm sorry, Akiko." -Hmm? Much softer than that. "I'm sorry, Akiko." "Please give me another chance." It is much more effective if I use this. -[playful music plays] -[grunts softly] -[mimicking sobbing] I'm sorry, Akiko. -[elevator bell dings] I made a mistake. -[sobbing] -[elevator dings] Crazy! [sniffles, clears throat] [pleasant music playing] -Excuse me. You can have this. -[Akiko softly] Evo. Uh, wait a minute. "On through the world we go" "An army marching with listening ears" "Each longing, sighing with a heavenly music he never hears" I want to tell you something. Later, okay? I can't hear him. "…a world of love to give the joys of pain" "A sweetest chords, adjusted by the angels" "are clogged with dust." "The sounds of crime and fear and desolation" "Come back inside with grace" -The poem's really good. -Yes, it is. What's that, bro? A little early to be drinking. Do you want some? I'm not here to have a drink with you, man. I'll be going back to America. My flight's tonight. So fast? [soft grunt] I just came for a bit, to see Grace. I didn't tell my mom. She thinks I'm in San Diego. Man, don't go! I still have a problem with Akiko. I fell for her. Really hard. [scoffs] You? In love? Bro, that's just your ego. You just can't handle the fact that you've been replaced. Whatever, man. Hmm. I still want her back. Your problem is so easy. If you want a girl back, why don't you make her jealous? Haven't you made her jealous once before? Hence she agreed to be your girlfriend. Make her jealous again. So she'll come back to you. Make her jealous? -[bonnet opens] -That's right. Who would I use to make her jealous? She knows all my friends. Is that even a problem for you? Evo. Take care of Grace. Visit her at the bar sometime. When someone tries to touch her, hit them for me. Okay? [sighs] Mark, about Grace… Oh, what about her? Okay, I'll take care of her. -[upbeat music playing on earphones] -[woman talking indistinctly] You're late again! Hurry up! -Evo! Hi! -How are you? How are you? Where's Grace? There she is. There she is. Wait a minute. [dancer] Let's practice. [humming, scoffs] [chuckles] Why are you here? You monster! You know what? You dance really well. What is it? You owe me something. [scoffs] You're even speaking in English. What's your problem? You know what? I won't tell my best friend what you do when he's not around if you'll do me a little favor. You know what? You're thick-faced! I'm not scared of you! [chuckles] So you don't mind if Mark finds out you dance at stag parties and let other guys kiss you? -How about I hit you? -Just try. -I will tell him. -No, don't. What's the favor? It's simple. I won't tell Mark about all the crazy things you're doing if you agree to be my new girlfriend to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. No strings attached. Once she comes back to me, our deal's off. Wait! Why me? There are others. There's Chicky and Dindi. Use them! They're prettier and sexier! I don't want other girls. I want you because you're safe and I don't fall for girls like you. [chuckles] Take your hands off me. That's your problem! Oh, really! I wonder what time it is in San Diego. I'll just ask my best friend Mark how he's doing. Wait a minute. What do you want to happen? [chuckles] [playful music playing] Can we change your name? It's so cheap! Grace? It's obviously not classy! Look who's talking! Your name is Evo. What is that? A bird? Ah, excuse me. Evo, for your information, comes from a name of a very fast car. [snorts] Mind your own business! Grace is Grace! So you should call me Grace! And why did you bring me here? Of course, so you can wear classy clothes. So does that mean you're going to buy this for me? No. I'll ask them to make a custom fit for you. -Really? -Yes. So you can change your cheap clothes. So when I introduce you, -you won't look like a rug. -Excuse me! Me? Cheap? [scoffs] Why you… You know what? You don't know what fashion means. This is in-fashion today… an off-shoulder with a ribbon here. That's classy. [chuckles] -Why are you laughing? -You know what? It would be better if you try on the dresses. Go. Go. Go. How demanding! ["My Best Friend's Girlfriend" playing] [Evo] Where is that girl? She might not come. [piano playing] [romantic music playing] [grunts] Why are you looking at me like that? Hmm. I'm sure you find me beautiful. -This is delicious. -You? Beautiful? Thank me for fixing you. -Wait a minute. Why are you late? -Hey! I had to ask my boss for permission. I'm in a lotta debt since I'm not working, so you have to pay me. Don't worry. I'll pay you. Is this mine? Hmm? Mmm. This is delicious, huh? Mmm. Mmm. -Hey! Eat slowly, you might choke. -What do you call this? No. What do you call this? It's tasty. Is this the first time you're eat this kind of food? What's this? Hey, Akiko's coming! Hurry! Wipe it up. Hurry! Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Ouch! What are you doing? We have to look sweet together. Sweet? You're breaking my hand! -I'll follow you. -All right. [lady] Come on. [both giggling playfully] Sir, would you like some coffee first? I'll be back in a bit. -[boy] All right. -Enjoy yourselves. -[chuckles] -What are you doing… Hey, Evo. Fancy seeing you here. -Akiko! How are you? -I'm good. Won't you introduce me to your new friend? Akiko, join us. Akiko, this is Grace, my new girlfriend. Babe, this is Akiko, my ex-girlfriend. -Girlfriend? -Yup. She's my girlfriend. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Thanks. [chuckles] -You know what? Evo told me -[Akiko] Hmm? -so many stories about you. -[Evo clears throat] Ah, she… she told me that you're so very nice and he-- she… she told me that you're much prettier. She's so right! [chuckles] -[chuckles] -Why are you laughing? I'm a joke? No, dear. Of course, you're not. Anyways, Evo. Congratulations. It looks like you and your new girlfriend are compatible. Just order. My treat. I have to go. I still have a client. [giggles] Welcome! Excuse me. [whistles] Sexy. So she speaks Tagalog. Why did she give me a hard time with English? Just wait for me. I'm going to the restroom. [upbeat music plays] [engines revving] [music stops] Good race, bro. [phone ringing] It's Akiko. What does she want? Maybe your jealous tactic worked. Who's that chick you used? Don't ask. -Akiko. -Hey, Evo. What's up? What's up? Did you miss me? Are you free tomorrow night? Tomorrow night. Let me check my schedule. Why? I have an extra ticket. Come on. Let's go to a concert. So can you come? What? Can you come? I'm checking my schedule now. Oh! I'm free. Great! Because I want you to meet Jeffrey. Who's Jeffrey? Jeffrey's my new boyfriend. The reason I'm inviting you is so that you can meet him. So I'll see you tomorrow evening at seven? Uh, okay. Okay, let's meet. Bye. [chuckles] What now, man? Are you and Akiko good now? -Yes. We're okay. -Hmm. [slow music playing] You really did that? [Chicky] You talked to her in English? She laughed at me. Because my grammar was wrong. Why? Why did you do that? You know what? You're crazy. Poor pretty boy. Why did I do that? So he won't meet me anymore. Because he wanted to use me against his ex-girlfriend! He's not that lucky! So, I played a prank on him. I'm sure he doesn't want to see me anymore! I would like that. Okay, bye. What's your problem now? What is it? I bought a ticket for you for the concert tomorrow. [Grace] Hmm. You're suddenly being kind to me. And this is just one ticket. I have two friends. Does this mean I'm going alone? No thanks. I'll come with you. Akiko invited me. You want to be embarrassed again? I don't. So here's your ticket. Go now. Goodbye! Akiko has a new boyfriend. And she's going to introduce him to me tomorrow. I don't want to be embarrassed. Maybe you can come with me? -Okay. I'll go with you. -Really? But I have conditions. Conditions? What conditions? First one. Don't kiss me. That's all? [chuckles] Even if you beg, I won't kiss you anymore. Second… You won't be arrogant. You're not going to irritate me anymore. And you'll do whatever I tell you. It means, I'm the boss. If not, I'll tell Akiko about your drama. Okay. I have no complaints. You're the boss. -Boss. -Third… There's a third one? -Are you complaining? -No. If I come with you to make Akiko jealous, it means, I won't be able to go to work. So you'll have to pay my salary. [snaps fingers] Down payment. How much? Five thousand pesos. -Five thousand? -Mmm-hmm. [mutters] Such a greedy person. -Hey! Did you saying something? -Nothing. Here. My down payment. I have lots of money. Are you doing something? [shrieks in excitement] [Grace] I thought we were going to a concert, but it's just ballet. [Evo] Don't let it bother you. [Grace] Hurry. Park it there. Reverse. You might hit something. A little more… [Evo] Will you shut up? I might hit something because of you. -We're here. Let's go. -What's this? That's my license. Give me that. -Let me see! -No! -Let me just look at it. -Stop it! -Give me that! -I can't let you see this! -Let me have it. I'll just look at it! -[Evo grunting] Just eat this chocolate. Don't look at my license. -Chocolate? -Yes. -Don't look at my license. -Okay, fine! Such a prick. Let me see it! Give me that! Let me see it! Give me that! [both grunting] Ouch. You are so annoying! -Give me that! Let me see it! -You're not allowed to see it! Ouch! What a prick! You know what? Let's go! You're so annoying! You're not allowed to see my license! Here it is! I'm going to eat the chocolate. Let's go. We're going to be late. -[Grace grunts] -Hey! Give me that! Wait a minute! What is it? -You look good here. -I know. Give me that! -Give me that! -Wait! Primitivo? [laughs] Your name is Primitivo! [chuckles] But you're using Evo, huh? So your name is Primitivo. Evo. -It says Primitivo! -Give me that! Let's go. We're late. Okay, Primitivo. [music playing] But I'm more excited to see what this girl looks like. Yes. -Hi, Honey. -[Akiko] Hey, guys. I would like you to meet Grace. Evo's new girlfriend. The one I was telling you about. Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Akiko has told me so much about you. [chuckles] Uh, excuse me. -Honey, the show's about to start. -Hey. By the way, Evo, this is Jeffrey, my boyfriend. Man, Jeffrey. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Jeffrey did his MBA in Harvard and he is now working in Mackenzie Consulting. How about you, man? What do you do? -Me? -Yeah. -Well, I'm a… -[Akiko sighs] Nothing. Because after college, Evo didn't look for a job. That's why he's still bumming around. So? That's okay and Evo is still young. And he's doing a lot of things like… -What do you do? -Yes? Can you please tell me what else he does aside from getting a girlfriend who cannot even speak in straight English? Akiko. I heard about that. That's so funny. Sorry but we can't help it. Your girlfriend is really funny. Where did she study? If she even did! Akiko, you're crossing the line. I'm a working student. Taking up my master's in special education. You know what that course is? It teaches us how to care for people who have learning disabilities. Unfortunately, it doesn't teach us how to handle people with personality disabilities -like you two. -[gasps] [chuckles] Just kidding! [chuckles] That's my date. She's something, huh? Let's go! Excuse me. [Grace chuckles] [Grace] Damn! You must give me a bonus. My nose bled because of that. Sure, boss. You impressed me. [people applauding] [ballet music playing] [Evo whispering] You were really good, Grace. You shut them up with your English. Wait a minute. Where did you learn that? How is it you speak English so well? What do they think I am? Uneducated? Of course I'm studying. Why didn't you tell me you're doing your Masters? Why? Did you ask me about it? You know what? I'm really impressed. [chuckles] [shush] [Evo and Grace chuckle softly] [Evo] Thanks for what you said earlier. [Grace] Thanks for what? For standing up for me when Akiko was insulting me. That was nothing. I just don't really get why you are so in love with that girl. She was just insulting you. [shush] [screams chuckles] Guys, please! [both giggling] [ballet music playing] [softly grunting] [Akiko clears throat] [clapping] Hey. [deep sigh] -Are you cold? -It's freezing. [Grace chuckling softly] We're embarrassing. [Akiko] Evo, wait! We're having a late dinner. Bring Grace with you. My treat. Um, thanks but I'd like to spend the rest of the evening with my date. I hope you don't mind. Of course. Okay. Maybe next time. Enjoy. -[women talking in background] -All right. Bye, guys. -[women] Bye! -See ya! [soft music playing] [Grace laughing] [chuckles] What have you eaten? Are you sick? Why didn't you accept Akiko's invitation? Why didn't you go with them? [chuckles] Come on. That's the style. I don't want her to think that I'm still after her. And… I don't want to be with her friends. They're so boring. You're right. I even fell asleep. [chuckles] [slow piano music plying] Oh… Wait a minute. Hold that. Can I have isaw? Hey, kid, what are you playing? Here, ma'am. Piko? What's this? [Evo] Show me how it works. That's good. -Just a minute. -Hmm. Taste this. -What's this? -Just eat it. [Evo] Hey, wait up! What's this? It's called isaw. Taste it. -It tastes good. -I'm right, huh? Tell me some stories. About what? Anything. About your life… if you have siblings… Those things. I don't have any. I'm an only child. My parents separated when I was young. You told me to tell you stories. Do you have any siblings? Yes, I have. A brother. He's a special child. Special child? Yes, special because God made them different. That's why you're doing your master's in special education. Christian's therapy is expensive and we can't afford it. That's why I want to study that so I can take care of him the right way. I don't understand. Why are you working as a waitress when you're a graduate in Education? My class is in the morning… and I want to spend more time with Christian. So I can take care of him. I go out when he's asleep. I go to work. Is that why you danced at the stag party? You know what? That was my first time. I did it because I needed the money. You know what? You're impressive. You're so young and yet you're very responsible. Unlike me. I still don't know what I want to do with my life. That's because you're rich. That's why you don't have to do things you don't like. But me… I have to do those things because my family depends on me. You know what? Mark was right. He's lucky to have you. Are you really in love with Akiko? Of course. Okay. I promise you this. From now on, I will help you get Akiko back. I promise you that. [Evo chuckles softly] [soft music playing] Thank you, Evo. You're not going to invite me in? Do you really want to come in? -Why not? -That's your call. [Grace] Bear with us. This is our house. We're poor. Mom! -Good evening. -Good evening to you too. Mom, this is Evo, Mark's best friend. -Nice to meet you. -Mmm-hmm. -That's my brother, Christian. -Hello, Christian. He might not talk to you. He's a special child. Grace, offer your visitor some coffee and biscuits. Mom, he's not staying long. He's leaving in a bit. You sound like you want me to go. Nothing like that. I thought you wanted to go home early. Give me a minute. I'll change. You might want to rest. It's quite late. I'll take care of Christian. -Isn't it embarrassing? -That's okay. Hmm. Thank you. Can I borrow it? Let's play. Pass me the ball. Can I borrow the ball? Huh? -Let me borrow it. -[whines] Pass it to me. Christian. Look. [Christian chuckles softly] I've been stuck with my thesis for ten years and I still can't get it! You can do it! [Evo] Psst. You can carry on. See you later. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! What are you doing here? I'm here to pick you up. So don't have to take a bus. But before I take you home I want to treat you. Why? Because of our jealousy tactics with Akiko. You were good. Of course! Let's go. Come on. I know you're excited to ride my bike. You know what? You're really arrogant. -Come on. -I'm really excited. -[Grace chuckles] -Hold tight. [engine revs] [Grace screams] You know what? When I was young, my father always let me ride a bike. But when he died, the bike was also gone. It was taken from us. Sorry. It's okay. And it was a long time ago. [sighs] It's beautiful here. The air is so fresh. Maybe Akiko and you are always like this. -Akiko? -Hmm. I can't bring her to places like this. Especially on the bike. When Akiko and I are together, we just go to concerts or recitals. Or just eat at the restaurant in the hotel. -That's all. -[chuckles] She's like Mark. He always takes me to a bar where there's a poetry reading. Sometimes I'm bored, but I just let him do what he wants. We're the same. You're right. We love them, but we're bored when we're with them. I never thought that was possible. It's weird. Grace, can I ask you something? Do you really love Mark? Why wouldn't I? [thunder rumbling] It's raining! Come on. Let's find shelter! Hurry! [pouring] The rain feels good! -Come on! Hurry! Come on! -Wait a minute! You're already wet. Stay with me.

Will they like it? What do you think? Can you tie this for me? Will I make some money with this on? [music playing in background] Hello? Am I talking to someone? I'm a human not a plant. I'm here.

[sighs deeply] I knew it. So what is it? Oh, my God. Are you marrying Akiko? No. Akiko's isn't the one I'm worrying about. Oh, my God. I need another drink. Ma. I'm falling for a very special girl. But she has a boyfriend. Son, when it comes to love… don't make any compromises. Don't be like me. I married only for practical reasons. I tried so hard to be a dutiful wife. I tried so hard to love him. But nothing. He still left me. And here I am. Alone. Mom… I'm still here. You're not alone. You're right. Among all my mistakes, you're the right one.

It's only Brandon. -[phone clatters] -[exhales] [Grace] Ms. Santos, hold on. I want to give you my thesis. Congratulations! You finished all the requirements for your master's degree. That's if you pass me. I'm sure you've done a good job on this. Oh, by the way, I recommended you to CARA for a teaching job. Just pass your resume on to them. -Okay, thank you, ma'am. -Okay. -Sister, sorry I'm late. -It's okay. Thanks to your friend. My friend? Who? Him. Give this to them. [soft music playing] How did you find out about this? Of course! I'm good. Wait. Why aren't you replying to my messages? I thought something happened to you. Sorry, I've just been really busy. It's tiring. I know. It's embarrassing you. Why are you embarrassed? I feel good. -It's the first time I've done this. -Really? -Yes! -Liar. When's the next one? Our next? Summer. Summer? -Yes. -I want to do it again. That's your call. [Evo sighs] Uh, Grace. By the way, I'm sorry. Sorry for what? Because… I forced you to pretend to be my girlfriend. And I even threatened to tell Mark. I'm sorry. -Because I thought--- -You thought I'm just a cheap girl. I'm not good enough to be Mark's girlfriend. You're too much. Not like that. But I was wrong. That's why from now on, let's stop pretending. -Really? -Yes. [phone ringing] Answer it. That might be important. -Yes? -Hey, Evo. -How are you? -Why did you call? Oh, why do you sound like you're in a bad mood? No, I'm not. It's just bad timing. I'm sorry, but are you free this weekend? Lyka's inviting us to go to the beach. So if you're available, come with us. You can bring Grace if you want. Umm. Sorry, Akiko but Grace and I can't come. Why not? -Don't tell me your relationship is shaky? -No. Why would our relationship be shaky? Then bring her. You know what? This will be so much fun. Okay. We'll pick you up at your house tomorrow at 7 a.m. Akiko, I told you, we can't come. Hello? Hello? Okay, I'll go with you this Saturday. -Really? -Hmm. I'll do it not because I have to. I'll do it because I want to. Thank you. Promise… This will be the last. [reggae music playing] Whoo! [giggles] [Akiko] Finally, we're here! Guys, what are you waiting for? Let's change. Wow! Where did you get this, Akiko? I bought that at the French Riviera a month ago. -I love it! -Thank you! -Go! -Let's go! Come on, guys! [girl] I'm so excited! Look at it! [music continues] Thanks for coming with me here. I promise this will be the last. Okay, boss… Go with them. Go change. I don't want to. I'm shy. Why? My swimsuit is ugly. Why? What did you bring? This. [chuckles] What's this? You're laughing at me! No way! This is what I expected, that's why I didn't want to bring it. You're laughing at me. What do you think they'll do? Here. What's this? I already bought you one because I knew you'd bring a cheap one. I'm going to wear this? Are you okay? I can't wear this. This is what they wear here at the beach. And one more thing… this is the last time we'll be together, maybe you can do it for me. Please? [upbeat music playing] So… Is it okay? I'm feeling a bit insecure. Hey, don't be. You're the hottest one here! Whatever! What now? Let's enjoy this day? [giggles] Hey, girl. Stay cool. ["All I Need" instrumental music playing] [people cheering] Girl's turn again! That's enough. [girls] We're already drunk! [Evo] I'll drink it for Grace. [girls] That's sweet. Okay. Okay. I can't do it anymore. I really can't do it anymore. You can do it, baby. You can do it. [girl] Let's play truth or consequence. [all] Right! Game. Game. Wait. Wait. Who will go first? -Ivy! -Truth or consequence! Okay. Here we go. [people laugh] Okay. I want a lap dance. [people cheering] Go. Go. Here we go. [chuckles] -Go! -Come on, guys! -Go. -You want lap dance, huh? Ouch! Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's do other things. Evo! [chuckles] Truth! Are you serious with Grace? Because if not, I'm going to court her instead. -[laughs] -Yeah, right, whatever. -Right? -Nice one. Yes. This is the first time I found someone like her. And I'm happy when I'm with her. -Aww. -So it's a yes. I really love Grace. [grunts] Okay. Moving on. -One more. -Who's next? Akiko! Let me ask her. So what do you want to know? Is Jeffrey the one for you? Have you found Mr. Right in him? [girl] That's so cheesy. Let's ask her if she still has feelings for Evo. Even for a bit. My gosh. Jeff, don't get mad. It's just for fun. Don't worry about it. I can take it. So Akiko, do you still have feelings for Evo? [clears throat] Yes, I still have feelings for Evo. That's your fault. [snorts] [boy] Okay. Okay. Spin again. Okay. Okay, go. Grace. I'll take dare. No! That's unfair. You can't. You can't. Guys, that's okay. That's okay. Okay, Grace… This is what we'll make you do. I want you to kiss Evo on the lips. It should be torrid. That's what I'm talking about. Come on! Guys, don't gang up on Grace. What's the problem with that? You're a couple. [girl] Come on, Evo! What's your problem? Since when have you refused a free kiss, huh? Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Guys, It's better if we go to bed. No! ["All I Need" playing] [phone ringing] -Hello? -Hi, Honey. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? I'm fine. I'm missing you so much. So? Are you seeing Evo? Does he visit you at the bar? What? Why? I'd told him to visit you from time to time. So, do you see each other? That fool. I can't understand him. But, don't worry. I'll be back soon. When? [soft chuckle] That's my secret. So it'll be a surprise. Hey, what's wrong? It's like you're not happy that I'm coming back. Of course I'm happy. I want you to come back because I miss you so much. Don't worry, honey. I'm coming home soon. Okay. Bye, honey. Love you. [phone rings] Hello? -[voice breaking] Hello, Grace? -Mom? My dear. Christian had an attack again. Grace… What are you doing here? I looked like a fool, Evo. But I don't care! I made a big mistake. My huge mistake was I let you go. What I said was true! I still love you very much. What about Jeffrey? Would I be here if I loved him? Only you… You're the only one I love. [slow music playing] -Evo… -Grace… My mother called. Christian had a seizure and was rushed to the hospital. I need to go back to Manila. Come on. Let's go home. -Mom? -Grace? Mom, how is Christian? He's still asleep. What did the doctor say? He had a seizure and then fainted. We're waiting for him to wake up to know if it affected him or not. Mom… I'll watch Christian. You need to go home and rest. Are you sure? -Yes. -I'll stay with her. Okay, my dear. I'll be going home now. Goodbye, Mom. I haven't even changed yet. -Sorry for the trouble. -It's fine. [whining] Christian? Christian, I'm right here. Christian… Evo, Christian is awake! I'll call a doctor. -[Christian whining] -Christian… You know, Christian is lucky. There's been no negative effect. We'll just prescribe something to keep him calm. -Yes, doctor. -Okay? Thank you, doctor. [chuckles] -[squeals] -[chuckles] [Evo] Don't worry about it. I'm happy that Christian is okay. I'm not talking about that. I want you to know that… I'm happy to be with you. [slow music playing] Grace… By the way, Mark called. He'll be coming home soon. Grace… I… If you need a friend, I'll be right here. ["Why Can't It Be" playing] You should go home. You're already tired.

How is she taking the breakup? I hope she doesn't have suicidal tendencies. I don't think she minds it. Since she has a boyfriend. Mark. Mark? Your best friend? We pretended to be in a relationship… because I wanted to make you jealous. [chuckles] So you mean you were just playing games with that commoner to make me jealous? Aww. You're so sweet! [chuckles] [Grace] You will drink your medicine. Ah, ah. You're a good boy! Drink some water. Grace, you have a visitor. It's Evo. Wait here for a while. It's Evo! Wait! Grace! Babe! Surprise! I missed you so much! Did you miss me? Yes, I missed you. You look like you're about to cry. Don't worry. I won't leave you again. I won't leave you again. By the way, I brought you some stuff. Wait here. I'll go get from my car. "The only difference with the love in Heaven" "From love on Earth below us" "Here we love and don't know how to tell it" "And there, we all shall know" Thank you. Mark… Are you okay? Why? I don't want to lie to you. What are we doing here? Stop asking questions! I have a surprise for you. Let's go? Why did you order so much? We won't be able to finish it all. We'll finish everything. We're not the only ones eating. There's four of us. They're here! -Hey! Hi, Mark! -Akiko You look beautiful as always. [Akiko] Of course! Are you surprised? You didn't expect to see us here, huh? Mark called me a while ago. He couldn't reach you. We decided to meet up, so we could all hang out together. Hi, Grace. How are you? I'm fine. You know each other? Of course. She pretended to be Evo's girlfriend just to make me jealous. What? Wait. So you mean you didn't know? Dude… Of course… I told him to make you jealous. [Akiko] That's what I thought. Now what? Are you guys just going to stand there? Sit down. "Pretending is a game that I never wanted to play." "It bores me." "Though I want to tell you I love you." "I have to hide it." "Because I don't want to hurt another heart." "But love is not just child's play" "And I don't want to play anymore." "So listen to what I have to say." "That's coming from deep inside my soul I love you, Robert." [people clapping] [indistinct chatter] Mark… How dare you, Evo. You and Grace pretended to be lovers. You guys didn't even tell me! I'm really sorry. You're the one who suggested it anyway. Yes, I suggested it but I never said you should use Grace! You should have told me so I didn't look like a fool! Are you mad? Why wouldn't I be mad? You told me that you and Evo don't see each other. Mark, I never said that. I didn't answer you. I wanted to tell you but they were already there. It's okay. Evo and I already talked. Mark, believe me. Evo and I never cheated on you. I know. I trust you. It's good, Vivian, that you came home to the Philippines with your son. I really missed you. Me, too. Actually… Our business is already settled in America. -Oh, really? -This is my gift to myself. To see my best friend. [chuckles] I can go shopping with you everyday. Wherever you want to go. Anyway, has your son told you that Mark is courting someone? [Evo's mom] Oh, really? I thought he has a girlfriend? She's coming today. I'll introduce you to her. Grace is coming here today? It's good that you're going to introduce her. Oh here she is. Hey. -[Mark's mom] Hi, Lizzie. -Hi, Auntie. Sorry I'm late. Lizzie, I want you to meet Evo. -Hi. -And Aunt Olivia. -Hi. -Hi. -Hello, Lizzie. -Nice to meet you. -Excuse me. -Go ahead. Evo. You're an idiot. How could you? Who was that Lizzie? Her? A daughter of my mom's friend she's been setting me up with. What about Grace? I know that my mom won't like her. How dare you. You shouldn't be ashamed of Grace! Give her some respect! Wait a minute, dude, why are you defending Grace? And what do you know? You haven't been in love with a poor woman like her with that kind of job with an abnormal brother? Dude… don't belittle Grace and her family! Or maybe you don't have the guts to fight for her. [boy] It's good that you're here. We haven't seen you in a long time. I know, man. What's up? The last time you were here, we didn't see you. Dude, you missed a lot. That's right, dude. You weren't at my stag party. -[chuckles] -Stag party? Mark. At the stag party… we filmed Evo's sex video! -Show it to him! Where's the phone? -Wait a minute! I even saved it, dude! Look at it! Worth it, brother. Give him space. -Okay. Okay. -Give him space! [Akiko] Evo, what's wrong with you? You've been so distant these past few days. Hey! It's Evo! Akiko… -I'm sorry. -Why? -What's wrong? -Mark! -[Mark grunts] -[Akiko] Mark! Stop it! [Akiko] Mark, what's your problem? You're an asshole, Evo! You had a lot to say! Respect! Respect, my ass! You even played my girl! What else did you do when I wasn't around? I love Grace very much. Dude… I treated you like a brother! You know what! You're such an idiot! [boy] Dude, why was Mark so affected by the video? What video? Do you remember during Jun's stag party, he took a video of you dancing with a woman? They showed it to Mark. -[engine starts] -Grace… He might go to her! Dude, who is this Grace? Mom? -Grace, my dear, your boyfriend is here. -Mark. Sorry I wasn't able to answer your call. My battery died. -Can we talk? -Of course, come on in--- Downstairs. You're hurting me… What did you and Evo do when I was gone? Mark, wait a minute! What's the problem? How could you do this to me? Are you a whore? A whore! -[grunts] -Mark! [engine revs] Mark, that's enough! How dare you show up here, Evo! Both of you! Why are you making a fool out of me? Mark, don't blame her! It's all my fault! Stop it, dude! Why? Are you the only one who can treat my girlfriend that way? How much did you pay her, huh? How dare you! [both grunt] -[Grace] That's enough! -What's going on? -Stop that! -Mark, let's stop this! [grunts] -That's enough! -You're such an asshole, Evo! Don't hurt Evo! Wait… You love him too? You love Evo too! You can't love the two of us! Tell me who you love more, him or me! Who do you love more? -Tell us who you love more! -Evo! [sad music playing] Everybody go home! The drama's over! [Grace's mom] Gossipmongers! I'm so stupid. Of all the women, why did it have to be you? I'm sorry I didn't tell you that… Grace, I love you. I thought it would be difficult to pretend that I love you. It's even more difficult to pretend that I don't. We don't have to pretend anymore. But I hurt Mark! And I know that you don't want to hurt your best friend! [sighs] Grace, don't do this. Don't do this. [Grace sobs] Mark was right. Evo, this is wrong! I know it's hard! We have to do what's right! But… Evo… Promise me… that you'll leave me alone and stay away from me. [Grace sobs] Evo, promise me! If you really love me, you will promise me that. I promise.

I have no time. I heard Akiko has a boyfriend. I was even the one who set them up. Really? -Evo. -[Evo grunts] I always ask you this. -Have you seen Grace? -Have I seen Grace? No. It's probably for the better. Well, seriously. Do you still love her? You know… that was the only thing she asked. That I shouldn't look for her. I will respect it. If that's the case… I didn't promise her anything. I'll find her for you. Don't bother. She probably has a new life now. If that's what you want. So… I'll see you at Jun's place tomorrow.
