I'm not sure If someone could fall in love with me. A prime minister for instance Don't spoil the floor He is good-looking and he is a relative of Mr. Tsunoda If you like someone else, I don?t force you. No, there is no one. Then, you should think about that. You?ve already grown up. I know Then you shouldn?t get drunk when you go to an arranged meeting You are not fair Why? You want me to marry that guy only to please Mr. Tsunoda No, it's not that. Tell me, are you really happy? Yes, I think? compared to other women. Did you really love my father? doesn't matter. I?m not interested in meeting him. I don?t care who he is. So, you criticize me, again. Yes. I like it. It makes me feel good. Well don't refrain then... I have no right to blame you.

That?s perfect. Teacher. Well... I had a question, but I forgot. Excuse me. My name is Kintaro. Kintaro, like in the song - You like public relations - With handsome boys of course You speak about yourself Shio is the salt, then what is ?SSShoyu?? Soy sauce? Let me see Well... It's not "Japanese sauce"... So, Shoyu is O-Shooo-Yu. How about violet? Because we also call soy sauce violet You wanted to be drunk to bother him, but it didn?t work. He likes you. Why is everyone on me about him? Why don?t you marry him? I know him since my childhood. It?s not original to marry him I will get married when I meet someone who makes me crazy. Someone to give your life for... What kind do you like? For example... someone like the cook here. Why don?t you ask him over. Melon must be cool enough now. Let?s eat together. I don't think, he will come here. - Why? - I don?t know - Then, I go to ask him. - He doesn?t like melon. Really? So what does he like? He doesn?t eat between meals. He says it ruins the taste of Sake. - He likes sake? - Yes, but only the good ones. You know well about him. Tell me. You like him. - No way. - Why not? Even though he is a cook... It?s none of your business. - Hello. - Hello. "Kazunoko" are Herring's egg and "Sujiko" are salmon's egg, right? "Ikura" is Ikura's egg? Are you serious? There is no fish like Ikura. Ah, hello Madame. welcome Ita-san, It?s strange to see you eating melon. Shinobu brought it. Do you want some? Well, I?ll have some later. - Thanks you for the melon - Not at all What were you talking about? You seemed to have a fun. Do you know of what fish "teigu" are the eggs? See bass. They change name. Well, I?m disappointed. You hoped to teach her something Why do you laugh at such nonsense? Miyako, this is our room. It's OK to bring your friends, but you shouldn?t let in the employees. Work, work... Is he so busy? Yes, his customers are keeping him busy Every day? I haven't seen him for three days Yes, he is very popular. He said he would pass by your place My place? Why didn't you tell me before? Sorry for disturbing you. See you next time She is like a cat on a hot tin roof - That's the wrong finger again - I'm sorry It's a pity. And yet, you are good at remembering pop songs - One more time - Yes - Did he come, Mister Takiguchi? - He just left What... well, I am so hungry Mr. Mori called. He'll be at Shiseido at 5:00. He'll be waiting for you But today is Saturday what do you think? We can't even see each other Kintaro. If you keep on like this you won?t have any patron left... Anyway, they are paying only 30000 yens Men in their fifties are stingy They call me when they fancy it You should say that to this Mr. Mori. I am sure you don't complain to him Mr. Nozaki is waiting for you here I don't know why he came, but you shouldn't ask him here So, you go directly to the party? What should I tell him? - Let me talk to her - She hung up She doesn?t want to see you. Where is that party? Listen, she won?t come here today. You should better go home I go to look for her.

I enjoy my life much more now. I will call someone... You women are all the same Don?t say that. It?s so foolish You left me alone for 2 years. What have you done during all this time in the hospital? What about this love among patients Well... We broke up Whatever... It?s none of my business. Move over Wait, Masae. I want to talk to you. Miss, You should go home. What are you scared about? I?m just taking a walk, in the same direction as you Don?t care about me But it was enough. Thank you for the dinner Good night Please, go home. It's late already I'm just taking a walk I just walk in the same direction as you - Do you want tea? - No thanks. I came to see your room I just came to see how you live. One can tell no woman lives here You have many friends, right? Do you go out often? It would be better if you stop going to party. Why? this world is like a swamp, You could sink into it You are exaggerating. This world is not different than other I know this place I was born here I have seen all kinds of woman Certainly, there are many women who have sunk in unhappy lives? Helping men who are cheating on them Working for nothing... They are stupid I can not blame them You may think I am old-fashioned, but they are living their lives thoroughly No one can criticize me, even though I love you You shouldn?t say that, even if it?s just a joke. Does it bother you? Excuse me... Today, I?m too straight-forward... Please go home. No It?s not fair to let me say such things. I really don't see why you are interested in me. Right, I don?t see neither. Please forgive me Ita-san. There is someone else you love. Please go home. All right. I am leaving We are back Take off your shoes. - It smells bad... - What are you talking about? but It stinks... it stinks Wake up the others! You went to bed after her you didn't notice? What happened? She tried to commit suicide. Madame. Stupid. If you want to die, jump into the river. I don't care if you want to die, but don?t bother other people. Mum, Marry is dead! - Hello. - What is the matter? You want to go to Hokkaido It?s the perfect season there But, it?s so sudden. I got an argument with my aunt and I left home. You like having arguments with your aunt, don?t you? Because my dad is on a business trip in Kyushu During his absence, I cannot stay with her. Her husband died during the war? Yes, when she was 35. Since then, she is alone... I see... It depends, your mother for example... In her job, customers are men So, it's easier to control herself. It?s probably right. Where is your mother? She went to Asakusa. She goes to the temple every month. Then, what do you want to do? I am burden now, right? I don?t want to go on like that anymore "like that"? why? Please don't get angry. Tell me everything, You are tired of me, right? I'm old Or is there another reason You want to get married? No If we continue, someone will find out No one will know No one found it until now Just I?m afraid. Miyako suspects something Business is good, there is more and more people Sooner or later, someone will find out You said that you already died in Siberia What if someone find out, I would admit it... No don't worry It will bother me if someone knows it Listen, we were... wrong from the beginning. Anyway, it happened and it doesn't matter if it was right or wrong Actually, you helped me a lot... Stop it Stop speaking to me like to a maiden I know you prefer younger girls like Miyako for example I know it Living under the same roof, do you think I can not see it? You're wrong, I would never... Yes it is the truth Yes it is the truth I know, but I don?t want to If I break up with you, I cannot stay alive I didn?t ask you You didn?t ask me. That?s the way it was We shouldn?t regret anything Please don't say things like that. I?m sorry for you That's why I... I said nothing even when you had someone else Because nobody noticed us but it doesn't matter... If someone find out about us I cannot stay at Fujimura So, it doesn't matter Go with some other woman if you want I forgive you I won't be angry If someday, you really love someone I think I will die. I don't feel very well today I had too many tempura and watermelon yesterday is it OK if I'm not coming to the party this evening? I'm serious I'm sorry for the disturbance Are you sure? It's all right. I wanted to play a bit more Let's go. Shinobu-san, your father called.

He was tired of living This porto wine is very good I can't believe you are so strong with drinking - Maybe I could be a geisha... - It's a pity you are not one. Maybe you should try You could probably become one. Even Kintaro is a geisha don't be like that It must be fun... Having dinner, drinks and talking with nice men Having fun all night without worries Getting married... what a stupidity You think so? Although it didn't work for me, but I think it is what is best for women Changing diapers, washing clothes and working like a slave? Yes but all women try to get married all the men who come here are married And young men are poor It's hopeless You think so? I wouldn't mind spending my nights this way Takiguchi-san... Thank you very much! See you soon. I won't go back to Fujimura. - Cool down - But... This is very good Would you take me with you? Nobody would disturb us Who would disturb us?

I haven't decided yet Are you leaving with Miyako? Let me tell you something... I've never mentioned that I like her Do you think I?m that kind of guy? I saw her today you know what she said? She asked me to marry you So, I told her honestly I won?t marry your mother. Our relationship is not serious. Yes, it was so at first... but now... please let me go.

You might think that I?m still your wife, but I think you are not my husband any more Sorry for making you waiting Sir... Phone call. Anyway, I will marry him. Don?t come here anymore. You spoke about suing him, right? We can talk at court. I have no problem with that You want money, don?t you? I say that I don?t want to loose you I cannot cut myself in two.

Thank you very much. - It?s not much. - Thank you. Miss... Where are you going? Tell me where you are going. I go to Kobe. I am really sorry I always thought that I?ve already died at war I wasn't scare of death and could be truly honest Then, I thought I was earnest with your mother... But I was acting like a lame duck the tail between the legs I was like that with your mother Like that? like what? So shouldn't you marry her? I won?t tell you any excuse. Why don?t you say what you want? I will never see you and your mother again so please make up with your mother. You have no right to say that. When you say that you died at war, It's just a way to ask people for pity War injuries are useless now You are just cheating women. Honesty you said... But a man who looks honest like you always hurts women You?re neither infirm nor honest Go to Kobe or wherever you want I only came to see what you do and how you feel don't be conceited...

Are you really becoming a geisha? Yes. If not, my mother and I cannot manage It must be a big decision. Decision? Yes... but as I have many models around me I would try anyhow. I might go abroad.
