(WIND WHOOSHING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC) NORRIS: Hey. Hi. What's your name? What's yours? I'm Norris. Hi, Norris. And your name? You'll have to buy a round if you wanna know my name. (CHUCKLES) I already have. So the first time I came home wasted I was about your age. What's your age, by the way? 18. NORRIS: Yeah, sure. I am. I was barely able to walk and my mom was there, and I went into the kitchen and I just puked. I mean everywhere (CHUCKLES). As I'm trying to help her clean it, I ask her, "Mom, are you still a virgin?" (BOTH LAUGHING) And she looks at me and says, "In times like this, I wish I was." (BOTH LAUGHING) I love my mom. That's good, kid, as long as she loved you back. Hey, you wanna head home? And do what? Play. Welcome to the lion's den. COLIN: Is that what you call it? NORRIS: Mm hmm. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (COLIN GASPING) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (GLASS CRASHING) (COLIN GASPING) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) You can take those off. You sure? DR. KENTYL: Yes. You be good. I'm watching you. Hi, my name is Dr. Julia Kentyl, and I'm a brain researcher and neuroscientist. I thank you for your time. I want to, I would like to scan your brain, do an fMRI and some tests to see, excuse me, to see if your brain is consistent with other. I understand you like it black. So yes, I would like to take some images of your brain, and probably if, if that's all right with you, do an electroencephalogram. And electro what? Electroencephalogram, also called an EEG. Brain cells communicate with each other through electrical impulses. So that's how we're gonna communicate here today. Excuse me? Nice to meet you, Doctor. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) After years of research, we may have a clear picture of why some, some people don't have emotions. Of why some people can't control their, their impulsivity. I have read all about your early years. You see, to understand if someone has an emotional disorder you need to examine them throughout their life. And so I want your consent to run these tests. Look, Doctor, that's really nice of you bringing me coffee and everything, but the truth is I, I don't believe in this psychobabble. This is not psychology, sir. This is the study of the brain. I'm honored by your visit, I really am, but I think I'm not very interested. Please, give me a little more time. I have put in years of research. Oh, you put years? What do you think I do for a living? All I ask is one hour. Do you know how many psychologists, researchers, and doctors have come to see me like I'm their celebrated pet, an experiment? Just one hour. Actually, I only have 52 minutes. And I can get you more coffee. And I've brought you chocolate too. All right, Doctor. Tell me why this scan is so important. Do you want the short story? Like we said, I got time. You know what I love about this place? It's the four seasons that look like one. I know. Yeah, I like my spring and summer with rain. It calms me. Hmm, you know how mythology gave meaning to the four seasons? (CHUCKLES) I think I skipped that class. Well, it was about the mysterious rape and abduction of Persephone. Sounds sexy. Mm hmm, well, Demeter was the goddess of agriculture and soil, and she had one beautiful daughter called Persephone whom was growing to be quite the young woman. And those male gods had their eyes on her. DANNY: Hmm, those naughty gods. Indeed, mm hmm. Can you put your hand there, thanks. So Demeter would take her for walks in the countryside. Someone was always secretly lurking and lusting for that young woman. You know you could be a model. The big, bad wolf. Yes, the worst possible, Pluto, the king of the underworld at that. One day the skies darkened, and the earth tore in half, and Pluto emerged from the darkness. Abducted the young woman to the underworld. He wanted her kindness and spirit to light up the darkness. Then what? Well, Demeter grew desperate, and her depression caused the crops to die. Hunger spread amongst all the workers. DANNY: So it's not only the government's fault. (CHUCKLES) No, it's not, but let me finish. Zeus and the other gods had to mediate, and Pluto agreed to release her every year for the spring and summer under one condition. Persephone had to live with him through the fall and winter. Are you like a professor or something? (CHUCKLES) No. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I'm Pluto. (CHUCKLES) I could use some sleep. Oh, me too. Can you stay still? Like how still? Like that still. DANNY: Is this a role? NORRIS: It's a choice. You know from the first time I met you, I had this, this feeling. Me too. Like a chill, your eyes. What about them? They're empty. NORRIS: Psychopath crap. So you don't think the term exists? It's not new. Aristotle's disciple, Theophrastus, was the first one to describe a psychopath a tormented soul. Now that I believe, but I don't believe the sociopathy bullshit. Sociopathy is not Psychopathy. One is the result of antisocial behavior due to trauma. Psychopathy is about the genetic and biologic makeup of the brain. Doctor, I feel sleepy. Okay, so what do you want to talk about? What about that chocolate you brought? (SNIFFS) Mm. All right, kids, we're out here looking for Mr. Irons. He's an old man. He's wearing brown work boots and blue pajamas. He could've gotten lost out here in the storm, or could just be confused and needs our help. We're gonna work down this field in some parallel lines. If you see anything, call out and let me know, all right? Okay, good. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Sir! SEARCH PARTY LEADER: What is it? There. Go grab the others. Come on, let's go! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey, Norris, do you wanna play some ball? No, thanks. Okay. The last century psychologists started to create a list of all possible traits known as the Psychopathy Checklist. Hare's Psychopathy Checklist, which is the revision of Cleckley, the man who changed the face of modern research for his masterpiece, The Mask of Sanity. I like that. DR. KENTYL: What? The Mask of Sanity. Why? Because that's what millions of people wear every morning to go to work, and come back to their spouses too. These Checklist traits need to be found across the subject's life. Like? Irresponsibility and failure to accept one's actions. Juvenile delinquency. Doctor, I have paid for my crimes, 25 years of time, and that's what you're running out of. Other traits include early behavior problems. Does that ring a bell? Searching for something that wasn't there. Babe, I'm on my period. You're always on your period. What was that? YOUNG MAN: What was what? That, what was that noise? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Fuckin' creep. I could fuck you if you want. You want to hear more traits? Why not? A grandiose sense of self. (CAMERA HUMMING) No, don't do that! You know I get pissed when you don't listen! Then how? NORRIS: Like you've been choked to death. Did I struggle? Of course, wouldn't you? I don't know. I've never been strangled before. Shut up and play dead or I will. (CAMERA HUMMING) Should I looked more surprised? Damn it, that's another fuckin' wasted role! I don't work for Kodak! Get lost! I didn't know we were Cannes with this. I said get lost! Lack of realistic long term goals. Now here in the morgue they keep the temperatures around two to four degrees celsius. The coroner here, she has to determine the time, cause, and manner of death. Now, the manner of death could be natural, homicide, suicide, accidental, or even undetermined. Are you paying attention? Yeah, yes, sir. Good, let's get going. I said come! Poor behavior control. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (NORRIS GROWLING) (DOG GROWLING) (DOG WHINING) I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. DR. KENTYL: Pathological lying. We have 64 cadets and 10 senior officers at 12:45. Got it, anything else, sir? I have noticed you only take baths. No one has seen you in the shower. Is this short of an invite, sir? Shut up, 50! One, sir, two, sir, three, sir. Get up! Are you afraid the others are gonna laugh at your small pecker? You know it, sir. Also, get a haircut, Private fuckin' weirdo. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) DR. KENTYL: Parasitic lifestyle. What're you doing? We can't just leave her here like this. Listen, orders are that we have to leave, let's go. She'll be eaten by animals. If you wanna stay, stay. I'm leaving, let's go. DR. KENTYL: Highly manipulative. It's so nice to see you. Your brother's been wondering about you. Yes, I'm sure he has. (GIGGLES) So, any serious girlfriends in your life? Yes. Oh, that's great. What's her name? Henrietta. Henrietta (CHUCKLES). I would love to meet her someday. Maybe someday. (GIRL GIGGLES) Fuckin' queers, why are we watching this? That is not nice, Von. At least somebody can relate. Then I yanked him out of the car, and I popped him straight in the mouth! He was fuckin' done! (CHUCKLES) Right, seriously, has any one of you here ever seen my macho brother get in a fight? (GIGGLES) Nope (GIGGLES). It always happens somewhere, right, Jackie? That's right (GIGGLES). No black eyes, no bruised knuckles, no scars. You're quite the detective. Yes, and I'm thinking about joining. First the Army, now the Police Force. Seems like you like to be surrounded by boys. Mother... Guys, Von, Von, Von, stop it, stop it! DR. KENTYL: Promiscuous sexual behavior. It's Cecile, right? Yes. That's a beautiful name. Ah, why are you here? It's an obvious question, unexpected sex. Well, I appreciate the honesty (CHUCKLES). It's a great way to wake up if you're not in prison. Right, I don't plan on going there soon. But, I know where we can go. CECILE: Oh, so cute. Yes, she's my girl (CHUCKLES). You wanna drink? CECILE: Sure. Hi, I'm Danny. Hi, I'm, I'm Nick. Hi, I'm Cecile. Well, we're going inside, Danny, Nick. We were just leaving. Oh, that's okay, Danny. It would be nice to know though, come on. That's enough. (BED THUDDING) (CECILE GROANING) DR. KENTYL: Short-term relationships. So I'm leaving for a couple days. Are you gonna talk to me? I know you're not leaving for a couple days, Danny. Listen, I'll be back on Tuesday, I promise. Aren't promises made to be broken? I'll be back soon. They suck the life out of you and then they leave. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about mosquitoes. We have a lot this year. Okay, fine, Norris. I, I'm not coming back. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) You've got to stop drinking. I mean you're gonna do something stupid. You're dying everyday. Goodbye, Danny, at least you exit as a man. Whatever, Norris. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I guess we're on our own, Sleep. No restraint over impulsive instincts. (BED THUDDING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) COLIN: Please (GASPING). No (GASPING). (GLASS CRASHING) (NORRIS BREATHING HEAVILY) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) We can sleep together a bit more. Then I have to go to work. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Oh, good morning, sir. NORRIS: Good morning. Did you move things around? Excuse me? I heard some heavy noises this morning. Oh, that, just woke up with a burst of energy this morning and just moved the living room around a little bit. Oh, that's good. At some point I thought there may have been a home invasion or something. Oh, well, thanks anyway. Have a great day. Have you ever worked in the catering business before? I was a hostess for a year at a restaurant. That's good. Are you pro union or do you believe our government would be better off without them? I'm pro union? Congratulations, you got the job, and you can start tomorrow. This means so much to me. Thank you so much. (NORRIS GROANS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Are you crazy? The Garden House fired black and immigrant workers for how they look, not for how they work. No, sir, please refuse to fill the vacancies. Why, because it's the right thing to do. Have you no conscience? Okay, right, I'll calm down. Asshole. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey, so we're having a little get together this Friday night at my place if you'd like to come. Thank you, I'll try to come. Unless, of course, you're gonna be too busy with whoever gave you those nasty love bites I see. Yeah (CHUCKLES). Did we score last night? Maybe. Wow, I'm impressed. I've never actually seen you with another human being. Well, maybe I haven't found my significant other yet. Well, whoever she is feel free to bring her along. Have a good night. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Could've closed the door, funny lady. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (NORRIS CHUCKLES) What're you smelling there, buddy? (SNIFFS) Oh. I think you're right, Sleep. Our friend needs a little bath. I missed you. Such a hard day at the office today. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (NORRIS LAUGHING) Hey, Colin, do you know what politicians and diapers have in common? They both need to be changed regularly and for the same reasons (CHUCKLES). What? You didn't think that was funny? (NORRIS CHUCKLES) (BIRDS CHIRPING) I must say we've ah, had our disagreements in the past. Sure, sir. But I'm here for the good news. Which is? We refused to fill the vacancies at The Garden House. Oh, yes, thank you, sir. But only until the dispute is over. I feel relieved already. You know, you are a hardworking man. Thanks. I just wish you'd leave the ideology out of it. I'll see you around. Fuck yeah. The neurons in the brain act like a million little batteries. The electrical field that is generated by these batteries can be recorded from the surface of the head using sensors that are known as electrodes. This brainwave activity is known as the electroencephalogram or EEG we talked about. Oh, back in Hong Kong we used to party like animals. Really? Yeah. How many languages do you speak? Ah, I speak three. Yeah, Cantonese Chinese, ah, English, and ah, Spanish, but just a little bit. How do you say in Chinese, you're beautiful? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You know, we party like animals here too. I don't have a lot of money. So do you want to tie me? I tie you, want sex? No. Come on, please. I know you want it. Do you like kinky? You can get yourself into some trouble, you know? (NORRIS GRUNTING) You crazy, man! Police, police! He attacked me. What were you doing there in the first place? I told you he invite me. And you say you were drinking. This guy is crazy. Okay then, are you ready to press charges? Sir. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Oh, wow, Norris. Well, let's not do the song and dance at all. Thank you, yeah, especially if we're not doing the song. Happy birthday, Ron. Yeah, I didn't even think that you liked me. Now, come on, you seem a little antisocial like me at times. Here, I also got you a tie. Wow, Norris, now you didn't really need to (CHUCKLES). You never know when you may need an extra one. And Ron, I want a piece of that cake too. Well, you got it. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Thank you for the tour. I feel so lucky to have a local show me around. It's my pleasure and we got some great pictures too. I wish I could stay a couple more days. Me too. You know, this trip has opened my eyes. Well, when you decide to come back you'll always have a house to stay at. Thank you, you are the nicest person I met on this trip. You fed me, gave me a drink. It's hospitality I never expected. Want some more rum? I kind of wanna relax. Could I listen to some music? Of course. Let me know if you want help. NORRIS: Ah, I'm okay. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (RYAN GASPING) (NORRIS BREATHING HEAVILY) (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So Dr. Khiel started examining whether the medial and lateral aspects of the temporal lobe were abnormal in psychopaths. This is part of the limbic system that controls our affection in the brain. How can you explain the psychopath to a kid? Make it simple for me. A smart man who is unable to use his intelligence to control his behavior. (NORRIS GROANS) Can I continue now? Why not? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Do you like this? That looks good on you. Do you wanna watch the movie, Ryan, or the talk show? All right, we'll watch the movie. Neurons need oxygen to work. With an fMRI a neuroscientist can see which parts of the brain are getting more oxygen. Less is indicated blue, venous blood, red more, arterial blood which carries oxygen from the lungs. The fMRI scanner can be tuned to record snapshot images that map the precise location in the brain where oxygen is being delivered and consumed while participants are under tasks and monitored by scientists. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) You know I think you're a gentle soul. Very good looking if you ask me. Oh, you're just trying to get me into bed, aren't you? (CHUCKLES) May I also mention that you're extremely perceptive too? Hey, I don't do men, got it? I'm not that aggressive, but I think we should move onto my place if you want to. Okay. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (MAN GASPING) Fine, you can you have my money. (NORRIS GRUNTING) (MAN GASPING) I could kill you. I think you just tried to. NORRIS: Sorry, I was just playing. Please, send someone. This guy is a lunatic. He's like two different people in the matter of a minute. DISPATCHER: Give me the address, please. 123 Rose Avenue. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) You Norris? NORRIS: Yes. Can I come in? Mr. Stewart said you attacked him. No, I didn't. So what actually happened here? Can I speak freely? Go right ahead. It was sexual play. Oh, well, Mr. Stewart wants to press charges. I told him I had to talk to you first. You used to be a cop. Yes, for a year or so. Well then you know better than most what pressing charges means. Yes, I do, Officer. So you're saying there wasn't an attack here? No, and then he freaked out and said I tried to kill him. Honesty, Officer, I couldn't kill a fly. Okay, I'm gonna write a citation this time, but next time sexual play or not you're coming with me. You got it? Yes, sir. Give me your I.D., please. You know, my place stinks, but this place is a turnoff. In the future I'm gonna have my eyes on you. DR. KENTYL: We flash words in sets. Emotional ones like death, kill, hate, and neutral words like table, chair, window. Normal people are more active in the paralimbic region when processing emotional words. Research shows that psychopaths are not responding. They are less active. So this is how a brain really looks. Do you want to see yours? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey, baby, I like your wiggle. Leave me alone. Oh, come on, honey, we can have a little fun. Listen, I don't pay for company. (SCOFFS) God, you're such a cliche. But if you're looking for a place to stay for one night and a warm plate of food, and it looks like you need a warm shower too. No thanks, I'll pass. I just invited you. What's your favorite plate? Some meat with just about anything. (CHUCKLES) I'll make you the best beef you've ever eaten. Come on. The day my daughter was born I found meaning again, you know? Actually, I don't. It's like from the moment they come out of the womb, the gravity of your whole world shifts. They become the center. Hmm, and how do you plan on supporting her? I'd like to be a painter. You know, like the surrealists. I wanna show you something. It's a masterpiece. It's one of my absolute favorites. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) It's beautiful. Thank you. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (MAN GASPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey, man, you gotta do something about that smell. Oh, that smell. You know, I think the whole building is rotting or something. I'll have to call the Health Department. Yeah, that's a good idea. See ya around. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (NORRIS SNIFFING) (NORRIS COUGHING AND GAGGING) Gray matter is composed of those cells that can form computations in the brain. In contrast, white matter refers to the tracks that connect the gray matter regions together. As we age the gray matter tends to be reduced in almost all areas of the brain, but there are other regions that store memories and these parts become thicker. High IQ is denser than lower IQ. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Where were you all fucking day while they were vandalizing our apartment? Well, some, some good watchdog you are. I oughta put you back outside in the garden all fucking day. (NORRIS BREATHING HEAVILY) (NORRIS GRUNTS) (SLEEP GRUNTS) Hmm, you better go fucking hide, you son of a bitch. DISPATCHER: 9-1-1. Hi. DISPATCHER: Do you have an emergency? Yes, I wanna report a break in. Oh, thank God you're here. Please come in. Look, they have destroyed everything, and then they smeared tar all over the apartment too. Where were you during the day? I was at the office. And this is what you came home to? Yes, this isn't a personal attack, right? Do you have any enemies? No, none that I can think of. Well, they came through the front door. I saw the wood chips. Was there anything stolen? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What did they throw that smells like that? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What's under this carpet? The floor. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I'm going to be talking with the neighbors also. I'll write up a report and we'll do our best to figure out who did this to you. These people have destroyed my life. I'll add that nothing was stolen. It's clearly vandalism. Dr. Khiel started comparing results, and he was able to test over 500 psychopaths in prison after creating a mobile fMRI unit. Doctor, any more chocolate? You ate it all? I've got some crackers. What type? Peanut butter. (MOANS) I love peanut butter. Guard, I gotta pee! But. NORRIS: I gotta pee. I think I deserve a better position than clearing tables and bringing ice water. Sir, are you listening to me? Of course. So what other positions do you have? I understand. I have no other positions. (WOMAN SCOFFS) MAN: Hey, do you wanna hear a joke? Yes, I'm a joker. So there's a Guyana, a broccoli, and a banana at a bar, you know. The Guyana says, "Hey, I look like a brain." Then the broccoli responds, "Well, I look like a tree." And then the banana takes a sip and then says, "Could we just talk about something else?" (BOTH LAUGHING) Cheers, you win. That's good. Hello. Do you need a place to stay for a night, young man? Yes, sir, I've got nowhere to go. Norris, I really appreciate you taking me in, you know? Finding people like you are pretty rare these days. Ah, it's no problem. You wanna go to the park tomorrow? We could have a picnic, maybe ride bikes. I know a place we could rent some. Are you okay? Yes. Well, why are you sitting here? My epilepsy pills, they make me feel dizzy. Ooh, sit here. I'm gonna call an ambulance. MAN: No, no, sir, really, there's no need. So where'd you sleep last night? Union Station. And your parents? Back home, left them four days ago. Left them a note. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (HORNS BLOWING) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (MAN GASPING) Thank you. (WOMAN LAUGHING) It was nice talking with you, but I'm afraid I don't have enough time. Doctor, I asked for an extra half an hour, and I was granted it. That is if you want it, of course. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yes? MR. HARDY: This is Mr. Hardy from the agency. I know who you are. MR. HARDY: Sir, you're late on your rent again. This is the fifth month in a row. Listen, I will pay you soon. MR. HARDY: The neighbors are complaining about the smells. I believe that's the sewer. MR. HARDY: Listen, I have an offer for you. I want to renovate the apartment, and I will give you $1,000 and a bigger apartment close by. Please consider my offer. I will. MR. HARDY: You will have 10 days to clear out. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (NORRIS GAGGING AND VOMITING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Having a barbecue, mister? No, just burning a little garbage. It smells kinda funny. Oh yeah, what's it smell like? Like a barbecue gone bad, really bad. Shoo, shoo, fly away, bye, shoo, shoo. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) In here (GRUNTS). MOVER: Yeah, yeah, we're all set here. Just need you to sing this release form. NORRIS: Okay. MOVER: Thank you. NORRIS: How long have you been doing this? For about six years now. NORRIS: Hmm. And I tell you, I've been to so many different places, you never know what you can find in people's closets. You have a good day, Mr. Norris. He examined density values in this region, and compared them to thousands of subjects. He then examined the density values in the paralimbic region and compared them to a normal database, and then compared them to other psychopaths scanned. The density measures matched the psychopath database in every area of the brain. It was clear there was a pattern of atrophy. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Atrophy? I'm not so sure that, that I can do this. It's just catering. It's no big deal. What do you think? Let me think about it, all right. Sure, Jimmy. I've kind of got some of my own business ideas. Great, I'd like to hear about them one day. Yeah, absolutely. You have a good day then. Mm, bye. RALF: Welcome to the neighborhood. Hi. My name is Ralf. NORRIS: Norris, nice to meet you. We live next door to you. That's me and my girlfriend, Dolly, and then there's Michelle and Mary on the other side. Oh, okay, I'm sure I'll meet everyone. Bye now. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BOTH LAUGHING) NORRIS: Ah, geez (CHUCKLES). I should probably call my mom. Tell her I'm gonna stay with a friend tonight. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm just not feeling that good. Hey, Mom, yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be coming home tonight. Oh, I'm just staying with a friend, it's okay. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. All right, love you, bye. (MAN GASPING) NORRIS: You look awful. Thanks. I think you should go see a doctor. Yeah, maybe I'll do that. Before you do that, I wanna give you my address and my phone number, in case you need help after the doctor. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I would like to see you again. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Your symptoms are consistent with strangulation. Who did this to you? I guess it last night. I was mugged. I really don't know who did it though. (SIGHS) I'm sorry, I'm just really confused right now. Okay, take your time. Go to the police if you have a clue who did this to you. In the meantime, I'll get you some painkillers and eyedrops. The paralimbic region regulates emotion and impulsivity. It consists of first the temporal pole. It is a place where a lot of information is integrated. Auditory and visual stimulation converge at the temporal pole. Like the editing room is for film makers. I used to own a Super 8 camera. This is the part of the limbic system that controls our affection in the brain. Doctor, how do people shoot their home footage now? With this thing. What happened to film? Film is dead, Norris. Now that's a shame. JIMMY: Hey, hey, man, do you remember me? Yes, Jimmy, right? Yeah, that's right, that's me. Yeah, what're you up to here? Just killing time. Awesome, well, why don't I join ya? Sure. Awesome. So tell me about this business idea of yours. All right, but you have to keep it between you and I okay? Absolutely. All right, so, so you know how babies wear onesies, right? NORRIS: Yes. Well, just imagine a mop on the front of the onesie. So while he's crawling around, he's also mopping up. (CHUCKLES) Genius. The housewives would just go nuts over this. Don't you think? Tell me a bedtime story. Okay, once there was this man who was colorblind, and the only color he can see was blood. He started killing and painting with his victim's blood. His paintings were wonderful. One day he drew a portrait of himself. It shows a man in front of a mirror bleeding in love with his dead body. How can you be in love knowing that when you reach that climax you will feel no more. (JIMMY SNORING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (JIMMY GASPING) Ralf, wake up. What's going on next door? (NORRIS GRUNTING) (JIMMY GASPING) Ah, I'm gonna go see. (NORRIS BREATHING HEAVILY) (JIMMY GASPS) (NORRIS GRUNTING) (JIMMY GASPING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (NORRIS BREATHING HEAVILY) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Really, tell me what it is that you do. Why are you asking this? I like you, you know that. I just think you're the loneliest person in the world. You need to get out more. Thanks for the advice. I'm not leaving until you tell me what it is exactly that you do. Okay, I finish the job, I take the train home, then I walk the dog and then I go to a local bar. WOMAN: And what kind of bar is that? NORRIS: Just a regular bar. I just talk and drink, and time just stands still. It's funny what kind of people you meet there. All their hopes and their dreams all seem to get drowned in alcohol. And then I leave and then I go back home, and I take the dog out for another walk. WOMAN: And you never take anyone home from these bars? NORRIS: Sometimes, but they're always short-term relationships. (NORRIS GRUNTING) (MAN GASPING) WOMAN: And why is that? Who cuts them short? (NORRIS GRUNTING) (JIMMY GASPING) (FURNITURE CRASHING) I do. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Because I could see them for what they really are. And what is that? Lost souls always looking to tread the way. WOMAN: I don't think you're telling me the truth. NORRIS: What do you mean? WOMAN: I mean you need your soulmate, your partner in crime. NORRIS: So I buy a house and get myself into some future debt? (NORRIS GRUNTING) (MAN GASPING) And become boring like you? (NORRIS GRUNTING) (JIMMY GASPING) WOMAN: Something like that. I mean normal, is that too much to ask? NORRIS: For some people it is. Are you normal, Norris? (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) This is the hippocampus which means seahorse, because it looks like one. This hippocampus is the seat of memory in the brain, is responsible for the consolidation and storage of emotional memory. It's one area of the brain that continues growing throughout one's life, becoming thicker as one ages. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Are you having problems with your toilet? No. Oh, we can't flush and when we do, the toilet in the next bathroom overflows. Ralf's tried acid, but it's not working. Maybe we should write a letter to the landlord. I think we're gonna call for an inspection. Hmm, yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah, all this just when my parents are coming for a visit. Oh, well, let me know and have a good day. So, what's the plans for this weekend? I don't know. Well, don't you just look jolly today? It's just that I'm under a lot of pressure. So what do you think you're gonna... Hey, some people just like to be left alone, okay? Got it. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What's gonna happen to you when they come for me? Dear Mr. Thompson, our living standards are below tolerable here. The hallways are dark and dreary. There are no light bulbs. When I flush the toilet all the toilets below start overflowing. And a very unpleasant odor is stinking up the entire building. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) PLUMBER: Well, it isn't the pipes. They seem to work fine. I just came back from the manhole, and that's where the problem is. What's going on, Dolly? The plumber's here. Is it serious? I don't know. I haven't been in the game for long, but this stuff doesn't smell like shit. What did you see? I'm almost sure that it's rotting flesh. I saw this grayish mass covering the sewers, and I saw the same stuff coming from the main line from the house. NORRIS: What is it? There's some rotten flesh blocking everything. Are you sure? I need to talk to my supervisor. Can I use your phone? Come with me. What kind of neighborhood are we living in? I know. How are we gonna use the bathrooms. I know, it's ridiculous. Okay, I'll tell them. Well, what'd he say? Let's tell everyone. We need to inspect this situation in the light. We'll be back in the morning. We're not gonna call the police, because we don't know what this, this flesh is. Are you sure it's flesh? There's 30 to 40 pieces of flesh down there. Does anybody have a dog? I do. Do you put dog meat down the toilet? Of course not. Well, somebody's doing something wrong here. Well, maybe it's fried chicken or something. Whatever it is it's not fried. Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. All right, ladies, we seriously need to get this guy out of here. Absolutely. I can't believe they're not gonna call the police. WOMAN: Me either, have you guys heard the noise coming from his apartment? Well, how can you not? He's woken us up several times. Well, me too. Totally creeping me out. I don't trust him. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I was just out taking a pee. Goodnight. The amygdaloid is this region deep within the brain, and it is responsible for amplifying salient information. This amplification interrupts our ongoing thinking and makes us pay attention. The startle response. When we jump in alarm it's processed by the amygdaloid. It prevents us from putting our hand on the stove. The basic fear and emotion contingencies. Well, what does it mean? Amygdaloid, it means almond in Greek. Again, because of its shape. We have two. There's one in each hemisphere of the brain. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) It's all gone. What do you mean? Can't be, it's all gone. There's something wrong here. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey, Ralf, what's going on. Somebody cleaned up last night. I saw everything. Come on. You gotta see this. Wait, wait. I was digging around, and I found more in the main line. Bring it over here. PLUMBER: It looks like the same flesh as yesterday. I think we better call the police. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Goodnight. See you tomorrow. Well, if I don't see you tomorrow, I'll either be dead or in jail. As always, very optimistic. I'll see you tomorrow. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Mr. Jensen? Yes. Detective Norton, homicide. We got a call about some plumbing issues. Do you mind if we ask you a couple questions? Since when are the police investigating plumbing issues? Do you mind if we step inside your apartment? It'll only take a second. You guys want some coffee and cookies or anything I can get you? Listen, before I lose my temper, where's the body? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What you're looking for is over there. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Are we talking one body or two? 15, maybe 16. DISPATCHER: No problem, all units stand by. Okay, don't mess with me. Please, just take me to the station. DISPATCHER: Area four with a weapon. Do you believe him I believe the guy's a wacko. I mean we're talking about a serial killer here with no victims. I mean the guy doesn't even remember who he's killed. The media's gonna crucify us. You can say that again. And to think, when we do identify the victims, what're we gonna say to their families? Sorry, ma'am, your son's been dead for the past three years and we did nothing about it. You know what gives me the chills? He's so calm, almost relieved. It makes me sick. The guy is a psychopath. We need to make sure he rots in prison. Someone from animal services will be coming to pick up your dog. Do you wanna say goodbye? Sir? No. GUARD: As you wish. But hey, what're they gonna do with her? I don't know, I'm sorry. (SLEEP WHIMPERING) I'd watch my back if I was you. I'm ready. PRISON GUARD: What? I'm ready for the service. I'm sorry, I've been ordered by the warden to keep you in your cell. What? You can't go to the chapel. NORRIS: Why? The other inmates, they're disturbed by your presence. Fucking maggots! Hey, hey, I could come in if you want. I've got more faith than any of you hypocrites, damn it! Nothing even works in here! The lights don't work! The heat don't work! The toilets don't work! And you's are treating me like shit in this fucking place! And I may be caged, but my shit can fly! Hey, open on seven! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. (NORRIS GRUNTING) (NORRIS BREATHING HEAVILY) All the Colin's and the Ryan's and the Spencer's will still stagger along their blind worried way unnoticed and alone. Society is more interested in their death than their life. This is the brain's little amplifier. People with psychopath traits show a reduced gray matter in the paralimbic region, the hippocampus and the amygdaloid. This is why you are different, Norris. We all have different brains. Time's up. It was a pleasure talking to you, Doctor. With atrophy, like a muscle in the brain, we can learn to teach it. But it all starts with research. I'll get back to you on that scan, Doctor. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (DR. KENTYL SIGHS) I have no tears for the victims. I'm empty inside, except for my dog, Sleep. (SLEEP WHIMPERING) She had always forgive me everything. Nothing by me could ever break her heart, and in the moment of her biggest crisis, I wasn't there. (DRAMATIC MUSIC)
