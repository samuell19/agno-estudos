Attention every dragon, attention! As you are all well aware, I am your town Mayor, Argon. And as you all know, if I'm not shouting it out, it's not worth shouting about. With that said, I have some very, very exciting news for one and all! Our beloved Dragon Town is, as you may have noticed, experiencing a bit of a Renaissance. We've got new, strange exotic creatures, like the camel, kangaroo, and the elephant. Fortune telling, costume contest, musical theater, blacksmithing, and of course, wing painting. But, strangely, the one thing we've never done here in Dragon Town, is a good old fashioned fire breathing contest. Well, the wait is over! Come one, come all, hear ye, hear ye! Young and old, tell your loved ones, tell your friends! Heck, tell your rivals too! For the first annual Dragon Town Fire Breathing Contest, is officially open for entry! And the winner is sure to be crowned the most famous dragon in all the land! Some of you may not know that I'm quite the fire breather myself! I might throw a claw into the ring, who knows? I want to check the rule books on that since, I'm slated to be judge. At any rate, next Wednesday's the date, high noon is the time. Until then, breath deep, and practice your flame throwing, dragons! The Dragon Town Fire Breathing Contest Grus, think of it! Dragons from far and wide, all getting up on stage to blow fire and show off! What a spectacle it's gonna be! It sure is Draco! You know, I've never even breathed fire. Do you think that's odd? Nah, we're still little Grus. We have lots of growing up to do. I'll tell you this though, when my lungs are fully developed, I'm gonna be the biggest, baddest, most fearsome, and revered fire breather the Dragon Kingdom's ever known! Wow, you think so? Think so, I know so! You have to envision your dreams Grus, before you can make 'em come true! Oh, that sounds like magic. It's not magic, it's just the power of positive thinking. Or negative thinking. Whatever we put our minds to, we can achieve! All it takes is focus, determination, hard work, and our ferocious dragon genes of course. Oh... What's the matter Grus? I don't own a pair of jeans, Draco. Not jeans, genes! Um, I'm confused. Hey, I have an idea. Have you ever heard of the mighty dragon, Lacerta? Lacerta? That savage dragon warrior from ages ago? Yep. Who led our town's dragons against a horde of rival tribes? Emerging victorious, in battle, time and time again? That's the one. Who was banished from our town forever, with the power of a magic spell, for being conniving, and deceitful in the eyes of the king? Hey, you can't win 'em all. I see you're familiar with his tales. He has more than one tail? No no no Grus, he only has one! That's not my point. My point is it's possible that a dragon like Lacerta could help two Pixy Dragons like you and me, win that Fire Breathing Contest! Us? Win the Fire Breathing Contest? That's crazy! Crazier stuff has happened, has it not? Uh... Like Marly the Maltese Dragon, nose-diving into that erupting volcano last year, and emerging without a mark on her! That was crazy! And Vin the Varmint herding those stampeding wildebeests through the town fair all by himself, without a single soul getting hurt! That was crazy too! You see Grus, crazy things happen all the time, so us winning that contest isn't so crazy after all, is it? It's still pretty crazy Draco, I mean right now I couldn't breath fire if I had to. How can I expect to get up, and beat thousand year old dragons who've been doing it all their lives? Where there's a will Grus, there's a way! How would we even find Lacerta? What if he's old and sick? Or, what if he's, you know. Dragons like Lacerta don't just lie down and die, Grus. They bide their time, watching and waiting, for the perfect moment to re-emerge from their lairs, and strike with savage force and furious venom! Yikes! Come on, there's no time to waste! Hey guys, what's up? We are, in just a little while. We're going on an exciting trip! Oh yeah, you're not gonna stick around to see the Fire Breathing Contest next week? Oh we'll be back in time for that Leo. We'll be back in plenty of time for that. Yeah, we got to be there to win. Win? You guys are as funny as ever. There's nothing funny about it Leo, Grus and me are gonna enter that Fire Breathing Contest, and we're gonna win! But neither one of you has even mustered up a fire burp before! None of us have. We're still little! It doesn't matter! Sure it does! Lita breaths fire clear over the snowy mountain peaks! You're gonna learn how to do that by next Wednesday? Maybe! Ha, I'd like to see you try! You'll see more than that little Leo! Just sit back, and enjoy the show on Wednesday! We have a surprise coach who's gonna help teach us everything we need to know about breathing fire! Yeah, and we're gonna wipe out the competition, and claim first prize, lickity split, I hope! Who's your coach? It's top secret, you can't tell anybody! Your secret's safe with me! When have I ever ratted you guys out? You told Scalington, when I stapled. Dopple's tail to the seat in band camp. Besides that. Oh, um... We're going to find Lacerta, so he can train us in all the ways of fire breathing dragons! Lacerta? Yep! Evil Lacerta, the dragon who betrayed our king long ago? How do you know he's evil? The stories! We all grew up on them! My mom used to tell me Lacerta stories when I wanted to hear something spooky around the campfire. Stories-shmories. Do you always believe everything you hear? About Lacerta, yes because everybody tells the same ones, so there must be some truth to 'em. You sound gullible to us. Yeah, gullible. I don't even think you should go anywhere near Lacerta! If he's even still around here. Nobody's seen him in a long time. Well then, we'll find out, won't we, and when we're fire breathing champions, you and all your little buddies will be singing a different tune! Yeah? Do you think we'll know the tune too, Draco? Grus! I mean, I'll feel a little bit dumb if everyone's singing but me. Let it go Grus. Okay. Leo, you're just jealous of our plan because you didn't think of it. But that's okay, after we win the contest I'll be more than happy to teach you everything I've learned! Then maybe you can win next year! Unless we enter again. Well yeah, duh! In that case, we'll be back-to-back fire breathing champions! Okay, but maybe we'll sit out. Maybe our endorsements, will have us flying around the world, doing interviews, shooting commercials! Being hounded by paparazzi wearing disguises, hiding behind body guards! You guys have your heads in the clouds! That's right we do! Come on Grus, we have a fire breathing dragon to meet! Okay! Later loser! See ya next Wednesday! Psst, whatever. Dragon breaths, I've never flown so far Draco! I've never been this far away from Dragon Town either! I'm beat! Let's take a minute to rest, Grus. We can use this lighthouse as a marker on our path. It can be seen for miles and miles around. So no matter which way we go, we'll never lose sight of it! Wow, smart! I know, right? Dragons from all over the world will probably write after I win the Fire Breathing Contest, just to ask me important questions! You mean us. What? Us. Dragons from all over the world will write us to ask important questions, because we're gonna tie, remember? Oh, yeah of course, we're both gonna win. It's gonna be a tie, the best friends, and the best fire breathers Dragon Town's ever known! That sounds too good to be true. But is is true Grus, it is! All we got to do is find Lacerta, and explain our situation, and I'm sure he'll be as excited as we are. Gosh I sure hope so! Brighten up my friend, come on, let's go further up the coast. Lacerta's lair is surely up North, and I'd like to find it by morning! Okay. The quicker we get. Lacerta on our side, the quicker we'll become the grown-up legends we were meant to be! Yeah! Okay, here we go! Uh Draco? Yes Grus, what is it? Can I rest a little bit longer? Fine, hurry it up though. We're wasting time! I'm hungry, I'm hungry! Hi there Pixy Dragon. Who might you be? Yeah we've never seen you before. We flew all the way from Dragon Town. Dragon Town, what's that? Wow, you've never heard of Dragon Town? File another one under crazy stuff, Draco. No doubt. Dragon Town is where most all the dragons we know were born and raised! It's way back down the coastline, super far! You got to be one rugged dragon to make the trip. Or two. And both of us are pretty rugged. Oh, well, good for you. I'm Draco, and this is my buddy, Grus. What's your name? I'm Pixypaw. Pixypaw, that's a dumb name. Oh... Don't listen to my friend, he has bad manners. You're name's not dumb, it's just weird. Oh, I guess Draco and Grunts aren't weird at all then. Uh... Good point. I guess we're all kind of weird. I like you Pixypaw, you want to hang with us and be friends? I don't know. What are you two doing out here and, where are you going? We're in training. Yeah, on a top secret mission. Training on a top secret mission? That sound exciting. Totally! Excitement's our middle name. Uh, mine's Donny. Donny? Now that's super weird. Can I train too? Um, no. No? No, but you can come along and cheer us on. That's stupid. Why would I want to fly off to parts unknown with a couple of weird strangers just to cheer for them? Ra-ra-sis-boomba! There, now beat it you selfish jerks! Wow, you don't take any guff, do you? Of course not, I might be a little Pixy, but I'm a Pixy Dragon and don't you forget it! I like your style, Pixypaw! I'm gonna let you in on our secret. Oh I feel so privileged. Wait, what does that word mean? We're getting ready for our town's big upcoming Fire Breathing Contest. Only, we've never breathed fire. You've never breathed fire, and you're getting ready for a fire breathing contest? That's right. Okay, so you two are looney toons? Does everybody know that tune but me? I need to hear it! What? Don't mind him. We're on our way to see Lacerta, the famous fire breathing dragon. He's gonna school us in the ways of breathing fire. Lacerta? Yep. Yep. He told you that? Well, not exactly. We're gonna find him, introduce ourselves, explain our situation, and ask nicely. Oh, well, good luck with that. What's the matter Pixypaw, you don't seem excited anymore? That's because I'm not. Lacerta's insane, and mean, and bad to the bone! Nobody good can ever come from dealing with him! Everybody knows that! Everybody except us, apparently. That's right, everybody except you! So save yourselves the trouble, and turn back now. That's the lamest plan I've ever heard. Oh come on, what are you, five days old? You're just jealous because you've never seen greatness before! Well, take a good look sister, here it goes! See ya around, sucker! Those two dragons are in for a whole ton of trouble. Wow, is that... Excuse us, Mr. Lacerta? Who goes there? Ah... I think I just swallowed a fire burp! Really, that's a start! Terror works wonders, I guess. What are you two jabbering idiots doing at my castle? Are you lost? No Mr. Lacerta, we're not lost, we came to speak with you. With me? You expect me to believe that? No one has been fool enough to approach me in 300 years! We're fool enough! That's right sir, we're complete fools! Completely. The line between foolishness and bravery has always been thin. Tell me then, fools, why have you come to speak, with Lacerta? W-W-We want to, humbly ask for your help. My help? And what have you brought to appease me, fools? Appease? What does that mean? We didn't bring anything, sir. Okay, okay, we're not here to fight with you Lacerta! We couldn't even if we tried! That's right! Just grant us the mercy to plead our case, mighty dragon, then do as you wish. Within reason, as you wish. Within reason. You're wasting my time, peons, make it quick. Yikes! Okay here, uh, so your old town is holding a big Fire Breathing Contest. Hi Mylo. Hi Mika. What's going on today? Not much, just thinking about that. Fire Breathing Contest that Argon announced. What fun it sounds like! I know right? We'll get to see many dragons from our town showing what they can do. I hear Miss Winger can spit spinning fireballs! And I heard Mr. Hatch can blow bonafide fire rockets! Whoa, that's gnarly! I wonder who's gonna win? It's so exciting! When it's all said and done, who's the best fire breather in Dragon Town gonna be? Have you given any thought to entering? Me? Nah, dragons like us are too little. We're not that little! Have you ever breathed fire, Mika? Well, not really. See. But, I had a smoke curl come out of my nostril once. Um... On purpose or by accident? By accident. Accidents don't count. But smoke means fire, right? No, fire means fire, smoke's just smoke. Unless we can harness it and perform at will, we won't even get to the talent eliminations! Oh, yeah, you're right. I don't know what I was even thinking. We're probably still years away from even spitting fireballs. But if that competition's a hit, and they start holding it every year, we can enter when we're older, and maybe even win! Ha, that would be so wild! Imagine the attention you'd get, and all the new friends you'd make! Not to mention the personal reward. That's the most important thing. There's probably nothing better than setting your mind to something, then seeing it through. Yeah, imagine it. Ladies and gentledragons, please give a warm round of applause to your new Dragon Town fire breathing champion, Mylo! Or, put your wings together for the best fire breather in town, our good friend, Mika! So, let me get this straight. Dragon Town plans to crown a fire breathing king, while the great Lacerta still dwells in the hills, nearby. Well, not a king, no, it's just a contest. What is the meaning of a contest? It's like a competition, a test of talent. A game with a winner. Oh, I see. Wow, I just explained the meaning of a word to somebody. Not just somebody, Grus, you explained it to Lacerta the dragon! You're right, ah! I'm geeking out, I'm geeking way out! And you two inconsequential Pixies would like to learn from the best fire breather ever, how to craft the mightiest flame, and defeat your myriad enemies? Uh, well, they're not really enemies, Lacerta, more like townsfolk, but yeah, that's the gist of it. I will help you. You will? You will? Yes, I will. On one condition. Name it! Anything! Not, most things. Most things, lots of things. Lots, but not anything. No, lots is good. Hmm, very. You will lead me back to Dragon Town, as your guest, so that I may view your fire breathing performances. Oh, yeah. Absolutely, no problem big guy! Done! Excellent. The punishment spell that cast me out so long ago, dictates that I am forever unable to return, and may not breach the town's borders, unless accompanied by a citizen who willingly leads me back in. Really? Huh. Well, consider yourself with us, buddy! Yeah, it's great to know you, Lacerta. Likewise, Pixies, likewise. We've heard so much about you growing up. It's awesome to find out, that that big old dragon's even cooler than we imagined in person! Grus, I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, and a new fire breathing champion! Two new fire breathing champions Draco, two! Ha ha, yes, two, tied for the best. Hey Mika, Mylo! Hey Leo. Hey Leo. Are you two planning to enter the. Fire Breathing Contest too? Us, we talked about it. But we think we might be too little. Yeah, maybe next year. Oh so you don't have a crazy plan under your wings, like some other pixy dragons around here. Who are you talking about? I'm talking about those two sparkler spitters, Draco and Grus. Draco and Grus? What are they up to this time? You wouldn't believe it if I told you. Oh no, try us? They're gonna enter the Fire Breathing Contest and try to win it, with somebody else's help. With somebody else's help? Nobody could teach two dragon's who've never breathed fire to breath better than every dragon in town by Wednesday! Yeah, nobody could do that! Nobody except Lacerta! Lacerta? Lacerta? The one and only. But, is he even still around these parts? That was so long ago. Our parents told stories about Lacerta. And our grandparents. And our great grandparents. And our great, great... You get the idea. Yeah well Draco and Grus flew off to find him last night. Are you serious? How could they be so dumb, that's a terrible idea! I tried telling them that but they didn't want to listen. Whoosh, off they went. Do they know where he is? I don't think anybody knows where he is, or if he's even still out there, but if he is, they'll know soon enough. You don't find Lacerta, he finds you! Jeesh, I've never gotten along with those guys, but I hope they're okay. Yeah, hopefully they'll both come home in one piece and chalk it up to a lesson learned. We'll see but you know, I was giving some thought to what they said, and what if their plan works? Hey hey Pixy Dragons, how are those wings flapping? How's it going Lily? What you been up to, Lily? I've been reading a lot, I love to read. Oh yeah, what are you reading now? I'm almost finished with this book about a daydreaming dragon who runs away from home, and ends up finding this mythical monster on a mountaintop! Wow, what's the name of the book? The Daydreaming Dragon Who Ran Away From Home, Versus a Mythical Monster on a Mountaintop. Ah, I should have known. It's real good, you want to borrow it when I'm done? Yeah, maybe. What brings you guys over to my side of town? Are you going to the fire breathing talent eliminations? Oh, are they happening right now? They sure are. You just got to talk to Argon and get your slot. Hmm, that's odd, we've never hung out over here. It's almost like we were meant to run into that talent eliminator. Yeah, what do you think, should we? It's not like we have anything to lose. Worse that could happen is we embarrass ourselves by trying to blow fire and just burping or something. It's not like anyone would expect two Pixy Dragons our size to breath fire anyway. That's right. You should go for it, who knows what might happen? On the other wing, if we don't try, we know nothing will happen. That's right, take a chance, live a little. Thanks Lily! Good luck! Here we are Lacerta, home sweet home. We're here now. You finally have friends. Welcome home, Lacerta! Yeah,. Uh, what? Still not paying attention in Spanish Class I see. Hello, ladies and gentledragons, hello! And welcome to the official Dragon Town fire breathing talent eliminations. I am you Mayor Argon, and I will be the. Master of Ceremonies for this afternoon, full of skilled, and perhaps not so skilled displays of fire exhalations. This is it, hit us with your best shots, and today's result will determine whether you place or pass, in Wednesday's historic First Annual Dragon Town. Fire Breathing Challenge! Now without further ado, away we go! Firstly, I have something very special to tell you all. I ran into this young pixy on the way over here, and can proudly say, that I was privileged to witness, her very first ever, fire breath. She did a marvelous job, and for one so young, I know there's much more in store. I can't wait to see what she shows us on Wednesday. Let's get her out her, Mika, come on out! Um, hi everybody, my name's Mika, and, um, well, I'm here to breath fire! Thank you, thank you. Okay, whew, sorry, one second. This is like, my second ever try. All right, let's hear it for little Mika! Second fire ever! What a fine young dragon! Thank you for sharing, Mika! Well how's that for talent? I'm telling you, Dragon Town has some of the very best fire breathers anywhere on this planet! I kid you not, we start 'em young here, we start 'em young! Okay, next up, please lend a warm winged welcome, for Mika's best buddy. Some of you may know this little guy from the morning paper route last year. Give it up for, Mylo! Hi everybody, I'm Mylo, this is my second ever fire too! I hope. Woo hoo! Woo hoo, yeah! Fire, smoke, she's a-rising! Hello again, Dragon Town! For those of you who do not know who I am, allow me to introduce myself! I am Lacerta! Also known as the Boogie Dragon, the Thing in the Shadows, and the Monster Under the Bed! You're all my dragons now! Oh no, Draco, and Grus! What have you two Pixies done? What have you done? That's what I call, a homecoming party. That was unbelievable Lacerta! The townsdragons were terrified! I've never seen them so scared! And Argon, did you see his face? I think his scales turned white! He looked like he'd seen a ghost! You two, go into the countryside, and locate for me the Ancient Dragon's Egg. Bring me the Ancient Egg, so that I may command the mightiest dragon army this world has ever known! Then can we practice fire breathing? Right away Lacerta! Here we go! Oh my gosh, are you two okay? We're fine Luna, it's Dragon Town we're not so sure about. I can't believe those two jerks actually found. Lacerta and brought him back to our home! What a stupid thing to do! To be honest, Draco and Grus have never really been known for their smarts. That's an understatement. What in the world will we do now? Our dragons are peaceful dragons. Nobody here is any match for a monster like Lacerta! That's right, must of us grew up hearing tales of Lacerta's fiery power! He's frightened our town's residents for longer than we've been alive! Talk about having a psychological edge! What if, what if we had to leave Dragon Town? Nonsense Mylo, Dragon Town's our home! There's no place on this planet that could ever take its place! But if... If nothing! Yes, Lacerta's a big bad dragon, but we're dragons too! He has no power that each of us doesn't also possess. I mean, I just learned how to spit fire a few minutes ago, so... Maybe a different level of power. Definitely a different level. You Pixies listen, I don't talk much about this, because well, the past is the past, but, my grandmother knew Lacerta. Really? Were they like, friends? You'd have to ask her. Oh. The good thing is you can. Oh. Grandmother Nala's lair is somewhere out in the countryside. She doesn't accept many visitors, because she's an old dragon and she's preparing to transition into the light, but if she knew what Dragon Town was facing, I'm sure she'd help. Your grandma sounds very cool Luna, but that's crazy! What could an old dragon possibly do against Lacerta? Grandmother Nala's fire breathing is more powerful than any dragon breath on this planet. Wow! Once upon a time, she taught Lacerta everything he knows. Get out! If anyone can stop him, or instruct us on how to do it ourselves, it's Nala! Can you take us to see her Luna? I would, but I'm babysitting little hatchlings at their house today. I'm afraid the trip would be too much for them, and I can't leave them here with Lacerta flying around! Right, I remember hearing the Trapped Alaricon Egg story when we were little. Yeesh, that one still gives me nightmares to this day! What's even worse, is that Grandmother Nala said it was all true! No way! Heebie-jeebies! You two should go in search of my grandmother! Tell her what Lacerta's doing in Dragon Town, and she'll help any way she can! Her telepathy is still strong, so she'll feel your presence as you get closer. Telepathy? I'm learning so much about our species today, it's blowing my mind a little. Me too! I'll hold down the fort here, and make sure Lacerta doesn't go wild and burn down our town! If he tries Luna, how will you stop him? I'm not sure, but I'll think of something. That's all any of us can do. Time wasting, let's fly! Be safe dragon friends! Pixy speed! What a slap in the tail! I can't believe Lacerta! What can't you believe, Grus? He was supposed to train us in the way of fire breathing, and help us win the contest on Wednesday, instead, he's taking over Dragon Town! Now, there might not even be a Fire Breathing Contest. We knew the risks when we decided to go find him. Maybe you did, but I didn't. Why would somebody we ask for help, turn their wings on us like this? It doesn't make sense! Because he's Lacerta, Grus, he's a bad dragon and always has been! We've all heard the stories enough times. He's bad, but we're not! Why wouldn't he help us? When he used to be just like us? Even Lacerta was once a little bitty dragon. That was a long time ago. I guess you're right. Maybe he just forgot what it's like, to be little, with no fire breathing skills, and a zillion questions about everything. Yeah, or maybe he just doesn't care. Or that. How are we supposed to find an ancient dragon eggs anyway? I mean, where do we look, how do we spot it if we do find it? I have no clue Grus, I have no clue. I know, what if we start digging? Ancient stuff's always in the dirt, right? So, it's got to be underground. I'll dig here, you dig there. Why do you think we should dig right here Grus? Uh, I don't know. The soil's the soil, right? It's the same every place, just like the sky. If we dig deep enough, we're bound to hit something ancient. Why don't we keep walking a little further, see what's up over that next ridge. Lacerta wouldn't have sent us out on a wild goose chase. I didn't hear him say anything about geese. Have faith Grus, we'll find this thing and get back to Dragon Town by nightfall! Then, once he has his magic egg, or whatever, I'll bet we can start our fire training! You think? Yeah, I kind'a do. I think. Draco? Yes, Grus? What if Lacerta got mad and, and there's not a Dragon Town to go back to? Look Mika, it's a dragon like us. Maybe he knows where to find Nala. Let's ask him. Hello there, we just came from Dragon Town. Oh, you don't say, I never would have guessed. Yeah, we were born here. He's being sarcastic, Mylo. Oh. Let me guess, you want to practice your fire breathing on my natural wood windmill here? Well, the answer's no. It's my windmill, and nobody's burning it down. Especially, not two Squirt Dragons practicing their smoke rings. We don't want to burn down your windmill, we just want to ask you a question. Yeah, and we're not Squirt Dragons, we're Pixy Dragons. Well excuse me. I didn't know there was such a difference. There is. Squirters, are generally found in the mountain regions, and they're about half our size. They're bred smaller so they can stay low to the ground. They live in the foliage, out of sight of the pterodactyls, and trab-di-laricons. Hmph, thanks for the species lesson kid. No problem. Now scram, I don't trust you two this close to my windmill! I built it with my own claws! But, we said we... I don't care what you said! It's Springtime! There's all this pollen in the air! One sneeze from you Runt Dragons and poof, this place could go up in flame! We're Pixy Dragons, not Runt Dragons! Pixies, Runts or Squirts, who cares? We're getting off on the wrong wing. I'm Mika, and this is my friend Mylo. Mika, and Mylo, snappy nicknames. I am Cyan. You some kind of traveling minstrels or something? No, we're just two little Pixies looking for an old dragon named Nala, she's our dear friend's grandmother. And, the baddest fire breathers these hills have ever seen. That too. Do you know where we might find her lair? Nala? Nada, nobody's seen her in ages. She might have passed on for all I know. Oh. Oh. I mean, I don't know, who knows? What are two little ones like you doing traveling by yourselves out here, looking for some old dragon anyway? We're not sure if you heard, but Lacerta the dragon reappeared, and took over Dragon Town. Lacerta? You mean the campfire story character? That's him! Only he's not a campfire character, he's real! Tell me another one! You two ought to put on a comedy show! Cyan, we're not kidding, Lacerta's real, and he aims to do bad things in our town! We love our town, and all our friends and loved ones are there. They're all in grave danger. You sure look like you're serious. If so, I'd say find Nala right away. I don't know how real Lacerta is, but I know Nala's fire breathing packs the biggest punch on this whole planet! She's the fire breather they're talking about, when they say "Fire breathing dragon." If I was going up against a mythical monster, I'd want Nala in my corner, no doubt. That's reassuring. Now if we could only find her! The hillsides look like a nice place for a dragon's lair. Let's go that way. Ah, cover your mouth when you sneeze, squirt, and step away from the windmill. Come on, we talked about this! Thank you for your time Cyan, we're leaving now. Yeah, just go wide, okay, wide around the windmill. Hi there. Hey, you guys are Pixy Dragons like me! Says who? I'm Teddy, the dock operator. You guys interested in taking a boat ride? Okay. Quiet Grus, I'll handle this. Where does the boat ride take us, peon? Just around the lake and back, it's a nice ride. What's in the lake? Uh, water? What about ancient stuff? Are there any ancient dragon eggs at the bottom? Uh, I don't know. You interested in renting scuba gear? Okay. Quiet, Grus! Just what kind of racket are you running here, trickster? Racket? Oh, you want to play some tennis. The courts are on the other side. Would you rather do that? A match is half the price of a boat. Okay. Enough, Grus. I said I got this. Oh, okay. Just what all do you offer here, Teddy? Lots of things! Dragons come from all over to kick back and here. Especially this time of year. We have the boats, snorkeling and scuba diving, tennis, badminton, fire breathing, dragon ball, rock climbing, zip line, leg swing, bungee jump, dragon glide, virtually reality parlor, spa, sauna, steam room, mineral bath, hiking trails, tunnel digging, egg laying, claw painting... Whoa whoa whoa, say that last one again. Claw painting. It's real fun. We have a wide variety of water soluble colors! Not that, the one before. Tunnel digging? After that. Uh, hang on, let me get our brochure. You said egg laying! Oh, yeah, sometimes I get mixed up! The egg fields are super fun. You got to fly over them though, there's no landing or walking. Some of our mom dragons are real crafty, you never know where those cute little eggs will be stashed! Direct us to these egg fields now! Yeah, we're looking for one in particular. Oh, I should add, none of the eggs are available for adoption. We only offer the incubating ground. Well, I think we already have one here. Oh, you do? What's the name? Lacerta. Hmm, Lacerta, Lacerta, that doesn't ring a bell. Which way to the egg fields, Teddy? That-a-way! Remember, no landing! Halt, who goes there? Nobody but us pixy dragons. Who might you be cutey pie? Oh no you don't! You don't fly up to my mushroom cottage and ask me to identify myself for you! You're the one trespassing on my property! We didn't mean to invade your privacy, little one! I'm Mika, and this is my friend Mylo. Mia's my name. Now, what are you doing, on my property? Hi Mia. We're kind of far from home and, well, we don't really know where we're going. Don't know where you're going? Sounds like you two are in a predicament, as my daddy used to say. Yeah, you might say that. And my momma would call it a conundrum. That too. Maybe you can help us. We just have a question, and maybe you know the answer. I stay off the roads around here, so don't ask me where anything leads. What's your question? We're looking for an old dragon lady named Nala. Do you know her? Nala? I sure do! Everyone around here knows old Nala. What do you two city slickers want with her? You serving a warrant? A warrant? Goodness no! A summons? No. Selling cookies? No, but if you have any we sure are hungry. Yeah, we'll gladly take a dragon bag. I'm vegan, I don't do cookies. Gotcha, we're from Dragon Town, and the dragon Lacerta invaded us! He's holding our whole town hostage! Who knows what will become of our loved ones! Our friend told us about her Grandmother Nala. And, the renowned fire breathing powers she possesses! Fire breathing power that can defeat the dragon Lacerta. So, we're on our way to find her, and ask her for her help. Ha, you won't find old Nala, not unless she wants to be found. So we've heard. We think she will want to be found! If her telepathy is as strong as we're told, she'll realize her granddaughter's in big trouble! And she'll do anything in her power to help us drive Lacerta out! Maybe, maybe not. Rumors of Nala's powers are greatly exaggerated. I've probably talked to her more than anyone alive, and she's old and tired, and ready to move on to the next phase of existence. A mess like this would only bother her, and she doesn't need that! Could we just see her? I don't think it's a good idea. Why don't you go back and ask your friend to talk to her grandma? She's baby dragon sitting! Baby dragons, how cute! How old are they? They're just hatchlings. Hatchlings! Cute overload. Go take care of those sweeties, and let old Nala be. If your town is in great enough distress, she'll feel it, and she'll do the right thing. Do you really think this is the right move, Mika? What if we were close to finding Nala? And what if Mia was lying? I think going back to get Luna is best. Lily can watch the hatchlings while we reach Nala. And when she senses her granddaughter, she might even find us first. I hope you're right. Come on, let's hurry, there's really no time to spare now! You were right Draco. This lighthouse is a great landmark for traveling. We can see it for miles and miles in any direction. Kind of like we could see those eggs for miles and miles in that field! There were millions of them! We could have searched for months! And without being able to touch down, it would have taken forever. Oh Draco, what are we gonna do? Lacerta gonna be so mad when he hears that we can't find that Ancient Dragon Egg, no matter how hard, or far we look! It's pointless to continue. Look, all I wanted was to learn how to breath fire anyway. I never wanted to take over Dragon Town! Or go on some stupid ancient egg hunt! Or get back at anybody who wronged me! We're two months old for crying out loud! Revenge won't be a thing until we're like, at least, six months! I know, breathing fire is all I want to do too! Just learning how to rear back and let 'em rip. Ho! Grus, you did it! You did it, you spit fire! How? I, I don't know. I, I just, it just happened. That was incredible! Do it again, do it again! Okay! I can't. What do you mean you can't? You just did it! But I don't know what I did! It just came out like, whoosh. I'll say. What was it like, did you feel it coming? I, I don't remember, I was as surprised as you! Hey I know, let's go back to Lacerta's castle and show him! Show Lacerta? The most fearsome fire breather, in all the world? What if I can't do it again? Aw, have some faith buddy! Maybe you just need to get worked up to do it! Lacerta'll make you good and nervous! Pay attention next time. Ah, oh, okay. Come on, we'll tell him we couldn't find the stupid egg. But we can breath fire! He'll see that the two of us are all he needs, and probably forget all about that dumb egg! Draco, that's a terrible idea. Nah, trust me, he'll like our chutzpa! Our what? Nevermind Grus, nevermind. Well Mika, Dragon Town is still standing. I guess that's good news. Hey there's Luna! Mika, Mylo, what are you two doing back? Did you find Grandmother Nala? No, but we found someone who knows here. She suggested that Nala would be more receptive to you than to us. So we came back to get you, come on! But the hatchlings, I'm still dragon baby sitting! It's no problem, our friend Lily is taking over. She's a sweetheart. She's really good with hatchlings! She'll probably have them reading by the time we get back! Oh, um, okay. Acolytes, have you brought me the Ancient Dragon Egg, that will grant me everlasting command of all dragon forces, on land, in the skies, or in the sea? The sea? Can dragons swim? Sure. You've never swam before? No, I'm scared of the water. Scared of the water? What kind of crazy talk is that? It's not crazy talk! I don't like the water. Eh, how do you take baths? You take baths? I don't believe this. You know I thought you smelled funny. I smell, I do not! Do to! Do not! Do to! Enough! The Ancient Egg! Where is, the Ancient Egg? Oh that,. We uh, we couldn't find it. You, what? We looked everywhere Lacerta, we promise! High and low, near and far. If there was a stone, we overturned it, if there was a tree, we climbed it. Yet still you disobey me! Disobey, no, not us! Yeah we're your boys! We're good Pixy Dragons! Good? Lacerta hates all that is good! I meant bad, we're a couple of bad Pixies! Nasty, the worst! Everyone in Dragon Town hates our guts! Hey, we should stomp 'em out! Yeah, all of 'em! Right on! Shut up, both of you! Okay. Okay. When you journeyed to this castle to beg help breathing fire, you unwittingly unleashed Lacerta! Don't we know it. And with Lacerta comes the power, and fury, of the world's most feared dragon! We know that too. A command from Lacerta is to be heeded without question, and without delay! I wasn't clear on that one. Yeah, we didn't discuss like a timeframe or anything. No, no time limits. Grandmother Nala! L-L-Luna, is that you my dear? Yes, yes it's me Grandmother! Oh Luna, my sweet, sweet Pixy! You're growing so fast! It's been so long! I'm sorry Grandmother, time moves so fast. That it does. When you look back from my perspective, it's like the bat of a wing. Who is this Pixy pair you've brought along with you? These are my good friends Grandmother, Mika and Mylo. Hi. Hi. Well hello you two. Welcome to my home. Thank you for having us Nala. Yeah, we've been looking everywhere for you. Oh? Grandmother, I'm so sorry to come to you like this, but, I'm afraid we're in trouble! Oh no, what sort of trouble my dear? Lacerta the dragon trouble! Uh, Lacerta? But, I thought, the townsdragons banished him long ago! He's back! And meaner than ever! Two of our town Pixies foolishly went and found his lair, Nala. Oh no, why would they do such a thing? For glory! They thought he'd help them to breath fire, which they'd then use to win the. Fire Breathing Contest our town is holding. Or, was holding. Why, that is the most foolish plan I ever did hear! I've known Lacerta for 300 years, and in all that time, he's never helped a single living creature, except himself! When he reappeared in Dragon Town, Lacerta was very angry Nala! He crashed out talent elimination show in the square, and threatened us all! He told us, we all belong to him now. Hmm, same old Lacerta all right. None of the Pixy dragons in town know what to do Grandmother, or which way to turn! They've never faced anyone like Lacerta before! We've never faced anything bad at all, really. Right, life's been pretty good in Dragon Town. That's because, once upon a time, the town elders, myself included, made a choice. We would use all the good magic at our dragon disposal, to drive the bad elements, like Lacerta, out of Dragon Town forever. And in doing so, we would usher in an age of peace and tranquility, for generations to come, allowing all pixy families to raise their young, happily. No pixy was ever supposed to know war, or famine, or strife of any kind ever again! Until you three delivered this dreadful, dreadful news! I'm so sorry Grandmother Nala! I'd give anything to avoid bringing you this news, but I simply couldn't! It's all right my dear, it's all right. Now that Lacerta is back, and you know what it is he plans to do, our path is clear. We have only one choice. What's that Nala? I'm going to teach you Pixy dragons all I know about fire breathing, then you're gonna go find that big mean dragon, and do what we did way back in the day. You're gonna kick his ugly butt! Yay! Yay! Well lookie here! What's gotten into you Luna? You want to drop those Dragon Town zeroes, and come up here to join the fire breathing heroes? Nice one Draco. Not at all Grus. I'm here to ask you two to drop what you're doing, and leave this castle at once! Dragon Town needs you! Lacerta can't win, and he's about to find that out the hard way! I'll believe it when I see it, Pixy face. Yeah. It's gonna take more than a bunch of minidragons to drive this dragon out again. Lacerta's here to stay. The sooner you realize it, the better off you'll be. That's right. Hey, I did it again! You did, way to go Grus! Tell me how, I want to do it too! Remember, we both got to win that contest pal! Tie champions, me and you! Tie champions! Does this mean you two are staying with Lacerta? That's right Luna! And you're on the loser's team! Scram Pixy girl, winners only up here! Have it your way. Can you believe the audacity of that Pixy? She's always been stuck up. Let her go hide under a bed in Dragon Town. Yeah, try to keep her tail tucked! Hey, hey come on, teach me that fire trick, Grus. I never remember. I still don't know how I'm doing it. Oh come on, I'm your best pal! If I have a, I'd give you half. We share everything, remember? I'd tell you if I knew Draco, I swear I would! Don't hold out on me, that's not Pixy nice! Draco, I'm not holding out! We'll see about that! I'm gonna learn your trick, and do it better than you! Then I'm gonna win that fire breathing contest, and you're gonna be nothing but a runner up! Then they'll call you Grub, 'cause you're grubby! Nothing but a grubby bum! Aw Draco, I thought we were buddies for life? Well, you thought wrong, loser! I'm going straight to the top, no stops! Aha, I told you! You did it Draco! You did it! Zip it Grubby! Okay. Welcome back Lacerta, it's been a long time. They're getting away, Luna! No they're not, remember what Grandmother taught us, come on! Ooh, action! Is that all you've got, come on! Give it your best shot, you lighters! Careful what you wish for, jerk face, you just might get it! You talk tough with your friends around you. But I remember you begging us not to bully you in dragon gym class! Yay. Please you guys, please don't pull my tail! He cried! And I remember you trying so hard to breath fire that you passed out in first period Grus. Did not! Did too, we all saw it! They got you there pal, I filmed the paramedics carrying you out! You what? Some friends you are! What? It was funny! It sounds funny! I know, right? Time's up Lacerta, your reign of fire is coming to an end! But I just got started! I, I sent you Pixy dragons scurrying to Hades before you were born! What I'm capable of! I've seen enough, we all have! With the power invested in me by my Grandmother Nala! Nala! Nala is your grandmother? That's right, she is! We got friends in high place Lacerta, higher places than this! It only means, you have farther to fall, rat! Take this! Whoo, close call! Nice shot, now you take this! That flame was too bright! Whoa, that was hot! Ouch, it sure was! I give up! You're just like your grandmother, Luna! I can't beat a dragon like this! I'm going back to my castle, see ya! Wait, you're not giving up are you? Let's just say, I'm retiring from ruling Dragon Town. I'm too old to battle new dragon blood! What, what about us? You two are in trouble! Attention, every dragon, attention! Welcome to the First Annual Dragon Town. Fire Breathing Contest! As you are all aware, I am Mayor Argon, and I'll be your host for this afternoon. And have we got a show for you! But first, first, I'd like to point out some heroes in our town, without whom, we wouldn't even be here today! You all know, it's still fresh in all of our minds, that monster Lacerta, and what he attempted to do to our peaceful town, with the aid of some of our own Pixy dragons no less. We'd all like to forget, but, you should always, always remember, so that it never, ever happens again. Please, now, allow me to introduce our littlest heroes, with the biggest hearts! Ladies and gentledragons, I give you Mika, Mylo, and Luna! They saved Dragon Town, they saved us all! Let 'em hear it! Pixy power, yeah! Okay, okay, quiet down, quiet down! There'll be plenty of time for celebration later, plenty of time! Right now we have a champion fire breather to crown! What do you say we get to it! Oh what the flame, I'll take a shot at it too! This is for you, dragons! Hi everybody, it's me! I'm pretty tired from all the excitement earlier but, I couldn't pass this up. All my life, I've hoped, and waited, and tried, with all my might to breath fire! And all my life I could never figure it out, until today! I was lucky enough, to breath with some of the best! My dear friend Luna, and her wonderful grandma Nala, big shout out to Nala! Nala! Nala! Nala! Nala, Nala, Nala! And, my best friend in the whole dragon universe, Mika! I love you Mika, long may we fly! Okay, I know I'm putting all your wings to sleep. I'll get to it. Here goes my best shot! One, two, three! Thank you Dragon Town! Hoo hoo! Mylo! Mylo! Mylo! Mylo! Hello Dragon Town! Mika! Mika! Mika! It's so good to be here, I mean that! It's been a heck of a couple days, hasn't it? Real quick, I just want to say, without being as long winded as my friend Mylo there. Kidding, kidding. Love you too, buddy. I just want to say, from the bottom of my Pixy heart, that I love Dragon Town! Now and forever! Long live Dragon Town! Dragon Town! Dragon Town! Dragon Town! Dragon Town, Dragon Town, dragon! I can't believe Lacerta still wants us to find that stupid Ancient Dragon Egg! What a waste of time. I know, we've been kicking rocks our here for hours. My toes hurt. You sure they're not burned from those Pixies spitting fire at us? Nah, I'm a little singed, but not burned. They won't get away with this, we'll be back, mark my words! Then Dragon Town's gonna pay! I hope so, they have all my toys, my books, my bed. There's nothing I love more than a good night's sleep, let me tell you! Now we have no choice but to stay up in that big castle with Lacerta. And he bosses us around all day long, with all his dumb revenge plots. There's not a moment's rest. Well, there will be Grus, there will be. Lacerta's one thing, but Dragon Town will rue the day they cast out Draco and Grus! We'll be back, and they'll be sorry!
