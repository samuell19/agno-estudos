(grandiose music) (gentle orchestral music) (bell ringing) (children chattering) - [Child] Could you give me a ride? (child imitating monster) - We've got to go. - Off you go matey dear. Wipe your feet on the mat mat. - Bye-bye blimey Barney old Barney. - Okay! - Bye. (gentle orchestral music) - [Cole] Barnaby. (merry go round squeaking) (teeter totter banging) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (bird cawing) (waves crashing) - Barnaby. Barnaby. Barnaby's dead. Barnaby's dead and I'm going to very lonely. (horn blowing) - [Man] Watch where you're going. (heavy breathing) - Barney. Hey Barney. Guess what? There's going to be a funeral. One of us. Great Uncle Barnaby, the one you're named after. You know, he gave you the good luck lion. Well, he's dead. Dad's on the phone to Grandpa Scholar. - [Cole] Barnaby's dead. - But Barney, he was really old. - I thought it was me. - Oh, grab him! Claire! Claire! (water trickling) - Barney? Barney? Hey, are you okay? - Everything sort of swung around. - Really? Oh, no. Let me have a little go at thee Marvely. - He's all right. He's all right Troy. Lucky pig. Wish I'd fainted, I haven't even once. These things always happen to other people. - Oh, you can just imagine it Tabitha. You're supposed to be the writer in the family. Poor old Barnaby Barney. What on earth happened to you? - Well, when I told him about Great Uncle Barnaby dying, he just whoo. I didn't think he'd even remember the Scholar family. Even I don't remember them very well. - [Claire] That's the Scholar family. I recognize your great Granny and these are the four sons. Grandpa Ben? - Yeah, that's Grandpa Ben. That's great Uncle Barnaby, who just died. That's great Uncle Albrecht and that's, Dad, who's the little one not looking at the camera? - Ah, that's the youngest one. Dead before your mother was born. What's his name? - Cole. - Yeah, Cole. Yep, he's dead. Drowned, I think. There was something really strange about him. Kids' mother knew, but she wouldn't say. - She told me. - We hardly knew them, we haven't seen them for ages. - We visit all Claire's relatives. - Tabitha, give it a break, eh? Oh, I was such an outsider there. Burying the kids' mum, Dove. - Hey, do you think we could go to the funeral? - No. - We're allowed to miss school for funerals and I'll tell you what, I won't write a single note for my novel until we get up- - No. - Oh. - But we can't just leave it. - Yeah, well we'll visit Granddad and great Granny Scarlet tomorrow sometime. - Um. Can't we just send a card? Well, Granddad's okay, but visiting Great Granny is like taking a long refreshing drink of vinegar. - That is not very nice. - Well, she's not very nice. - She is a tyrant. Never liked me, ever. - Oh, surely not. - I mean it. She didn't like me marrying Dove in the first place and then when Dove died, she blamed me and then when I married you, oh, ho, it really hit the fan then. - She was married herself, wasn't she John? - Yeah, but only to her cousin. She was a Scholar two times over. I'm gonna write a story about her. A sort of horror story. (laughing) Hey, look Barn, ancestors. (creepy music) - Hey, take it easy with my photo. You'll get butter on it. - You think you're the boss of all the pictures. - Hey, you two, dishes, Barney bed. - Troy! Huh! - Hey Barney. Did you have nightmares after you fainted? - Not with the good luck lion. (creepy music) There you are. I'll put you there and you wake me up in the morning. (lion thudding) - You all right? - Can I read a book first? - Better not, you've been a bit fragile. - I haven't really. - Don't argue with your busy mother. - I wish you were real. - I am real. - No, I mean my real mother. - But I love you. You are my real boy, so there, how's this for real. Go on, say real enough. - Okay, real enough. - No more worrying and no more fainting. - No, promise. - Okay. - No snoring and no bad dreams. Okay? All right. - Claire? - [Claire] Hmm? - Did my mother know it was me being born before she died? - I'm not sure really. But I think that she probably did in a very special way. Hey. Goodnight. - It's funny, really. - [Claire] Hmm? - We'll all sort of strung out in between. - In between what? - In between being born and being dead. - I suppose we are really. Hey, don't think you're gonna be allowed to stay up any extra because of deep thoughts. No more from you or I'm gonna send Tabitha up to talk you to sleep, okay? Goodnight. (light clicking) (gentle eerie music) - No! - Barnaby. Barnaby. Barnaby. Barnaby's dead. Barnaby's dead. I mustn't be left alone. If I grow lonely, I might grow wicked. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) - Hey, Dad, turn if off, quick. - Claire can hardly get out. - Ah, I'm not the only one (laughing). (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) - And Tabitha, don't you be writing in that book all day, okay? - Look, you lot, everyone is to behave absolutely wonderfully today. Not just Troy, all of you okay? Especially you, John. Do me credit. - Hey, well what about kissing in a place where someone's died? - That's allowed. - [Claire] That is just to give me strength among all your relations. - [Tabitha] Especially Great Granny. - [John] Tabitha, come back here! Tabitha. (knocking) - Granddad. - Tabitha. Claire, you look lovely. Wilderbeast. I know, I know, next time use a ladder. - Or get someone to hold it. - Troy dear. (eerie music) Come in Barney. In you go Barney. (clock ticking) - It's always the boys. - Oh, Uncle Albert, we haven't seen you over such a long time. - Time. - It's strange I mean that it should take something like a death to bring families together. - Together. - John Palmer. This is a rather unexpected pleasure. - Granny. - I thought you'd forgotten I existed. And how are the children? We don't seem to see a great deal of them these days. Troy? - Troy. - They always look a little sulky at this age, don't they? My word Tabitha. What a big girl you're growing into. And little Barney. Growing up, too. - Yes, he's really hard on the biscuit tins these days. - And what about you Claire? I hope you're giving yourself time to take proper care of yourself. It'll be terrible if poor John lost a second wife. - I'm really tough. - You need to be, taking on poor Dove's children. - Daddy's, too, and Claire's. - Some boys can be a lot of trouble. - Not Barney, he's terrific. - I know, Claire. We've had them in the family before. - [Tabitha] Great Uncle Albert, may I ask- - Barney, come with me a minute. Now, let me see, how old are you again? - Eight. - What's that you have there? - Great Uncle Barnaby gave it to me. - [Granddad] Was this one of ours? - Granddad, can I have a look at the cupboard under the stairs? - Oh, the old toy cupboard, yes, yes. We may still have a few bits and pieces. Here, son, glad you brought that. Something nice to remember Barnaby by, hmm? Remember the way? - Yep. (eerie music) (door squeaking) (light clicking) (Barnaby blowing) There. There, you talk to him. (gentle eerie music) (water dripping) (clock ticking) (eerie music) - [Grandmother] Come. - [Young Cole] Leave me alone. - [Grandmother] It's a wicked park Cole. - [Young Cole] No. No. - [Grandmother] I'm your mother, I'm responsible for you. You'll do what I tell you Cole. - [Young Cole] No, no. - [Grandmother] If you don't stop it right now, you'll suffer for it later. - And Granddad, he just keeled over and Troy and I tried to catch him. - Tabitha, don't put that cake back on the plate darling. - Well, I have it if no one else wants it. I mean, Great Granny's floor's pretty clean. - [Claire] Tabitha, you're not to eat that cake. - [John] Yeah, you'll spoil your- - [Granddad] Here you are lad. And I'll put your tea up there, all right. - Anyhow, about Barney. What he said was, I suppose it was me. Then he went all limp and then blonk. Anyway, then Claire came along and it all turned out there was nothing wrong with him. Nothing sick. He was just sort of sensitive. Lucky pig. I've never fainted. It should have been me. Nothing good ever happens to me. You can't write well if nothing ever happens to you. - [John] You write good enough Tabitha. - [Tabitha] But I want to do more mature stuff about being in love and funerals and things. I'm sick of doing horses all the time. - [John] That's enough Tabitha. - But. - I mean it. - [John] Go and see what Barney's doing. (eerie music) - Hey. Did you see that? (dishes crashing) - Oh, Barney, what have you done? Quick, a cloth. - [John] That's it. - [Claire] A cloth before it soaks into the carpet. - [John] Get your things together. It's all right, we got the time. Don't think it'll stain. - [Tabitha] Troy, did you see that? - Shh. - No, look, I really do think it's time we were going anyway. - [Claire] I'm really sorry. - [John] Come on Tab. That's all (indistinct). - Anytime. - [Granddad] You, too Tabitha. - Leave it. You can't take it away. - [John] Tabitha. - If belongs here. (eerie music) - I keep seeing it. Just sort of a ghost. - Can you see through it? Is it transparent? - Don't tell anyone. - Shee, I was thinking I'd tell everyone. I think this is really exciting. - Don't tell Claire. - Claire would be on your side. - She's having a baby. Promise? Anyhow, she'd think I was mad. Go on, promise. - Okay. - Double promise. - All right, double promise. Locked lips tie up tight, mm. Aren't things exciting. When I look afterwards that writing had just vanished away. - My lion. - There was a little bit of the photograph of the lost uncle. He looked just like you. - I left it behind. My good luck's gone. (eerie music) - [Cole] Barnaby? - No! - [Cole] Barnaby. Barnaby. Don't you see I was a child once. I still am really. I'm coming to get you. Slowly. You'll have time to get used to me. (suspenseful music) (door squeaking) (door squeaking) (door slamming) (clock ticking) (clock bell chiming) - Barney. - Came here for my lion. - She won't come down here, you know. King of the kitchen (laughing). - I came back to get my good luck lion. - Lion? Oh, I can't see that bringing you good luck. Not in the long run. Did you know that he made it? - Great Uncle Barnaby? - No, no, no, no, no. Him. Your Great Uncle Cole (maniacal laughing). - Was he funny? - Funny? None of us laughed in those days, I assure you. (maniacal laughing) He was a Scholar magician. - What's that? - What's that? Well, he could move things without touching them. Get visions. Oh, yes, Cole ran through the house like electricity. He could be anything he wanted to be. Dust on a ledge. Words on a page. - Words? - You do look like him, you now. Only happier. Much happier. Cole was such a sad child. Sad. Angry. That scrapbook you found, Barnaby made that for Cole and Cole used to make him things in return using his magic. Little wooden toys. He drew them out of the house in some way. Animals. Horses. Lions. (gentle suspenseful music) Barnaby used to encourage him. Your Great Granny hated that. She used to spy on that. - [Grandmother] Cole! - [Uncle] As for cornering him, he was everywhere, like a wind blowing through all the cracks and crevices, like water soaking through the sand. - I know. - Yes, you might. She was always on at him. Thought she could make him give his imagining up. - Didn't you like him very much? - Very much? (maniacal laughing) Well, it's every man for himself, isn't it? He upset her. So much trouble. She always had to win. (fire crackling) Wouldn't let Cole have any comfort until he fell in line with the rest of us. Barnaby did what he could. (flames brewing) (door jarring) Cole wanted to be loved. That's why he stayed around for so long. Of course, none of us dared. Well, Barnaby. He's dead now. Father died. Cole went down south. Drowned. Drowned. Mother went to identify him. - I'm not really like him. (laughing) - That's a boy. Fight it off. - Great Uncle Albrecht, find that lion I left here the other day. - Oh, yes, your lion. She might have found it. But I'd forget about those sort of things if I were you and I wouldn't even think about Cole or anything about him. (dog barking) Not in your position. - [Exercise Instructor] And stretch. And bend. Stretching out. And bend. (door opening) - Where've you been? - I was just, I was just playing. (gentle music) It's not the same. I only want the real one. - [Cole] Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby. Barnaby? Barnaby! - What do you want? - Barnaby. - I'm not him. - We belong together Barnaby. - I belong here with my family. - There's no place in any family for the likes of you and me. You're a Scholar magician. - I'm not. I'm just a boy. - I can tell you're finding this strange. Nevermind, I'll be with you soon. (bird cawing) (moaning) (TV chattering) - [John] You'll make yourself sick Tabitha. See you love. See you later kids. - Bye. Lucky pig. Wish I could get off school. Barney. - Don't make me look. He'll see you. It's okay. He's gone. He's there. Then he isn't. - Is it really Cole? - Hey, Claire, have you seen my homework folder? - Tell Claire. - [Claire] I don't remember. Hang on, did it have a red cover on it? - Orange. - [Claire] I did see it somewhere. Fancy you forgetting to put things away. - I must have been thinking of something else. - Go on, tell Claire. - No. - Why not? - It's not good for pregnant ladies to be worried. - She's worried anyway, you drongo. You look sort of yellowish, like cooking oil. I'm gonna tell her. - You double promised. - Troy, what is wrong with him, he's not talking to me anymore. - It's honestly got nothing to do with you, Claire. I mean, it's not your fault. Look, Barney thinks that if he upsets you, you might die having the baby. Because our mother did. Thanks. - Who's got the car keys? - Tell Dad. Go on, tell Dad. - He'd only tell Claire. - Oh, you had them, thanks love. See you later. - All the fuss about nothing. The keys were in the pocket of his shorts, his shorts were in the laundry basket, simple. You can go back to bed. You're still looking a bit peaky. Tabitha! You're going to be late. (sighing) - Claire? Just say you've go at friend who needs to be helped and you want to help him, but you've double promised not to. - Very tricky. But right o' light you should be able to think around a promise of that kind. You going to be late. - I know. And this is the ghost that's getting close to him and that I'm not allowed to tell Claire because she's having a baby. She might die. You know. Like our mother. But this morning the ghost got into Barney and I have to tell someone. I'm not making it up. It's true, he's haunted. - I don't think Barney's haunted. - You should see him. - I think I know what's the matter with him and it's nothing any of us can do anything about. - Well? What is it then? - Well, obviously by now you know that there was something very odd about your Great Uncle Cole, hmm? We think Barney's becoming the same as Cole used to be. It's in the family. It's a sort of family curse. Barney's another Scholar magician. - Magician. How do you know? - Well. The other day when you all came to see us, I realized that we all recognized it at once. A sort of electricity running right through the house. There it was again, beginning in Barney. - Was Cole electric? - Not exactly. Here, take this lion that Barney left at our place. Cole made that by the power of his magic. We've had magicians in the Scholar family for years, well before we came to New Zealand. We used to- - Grandpa, Grandpa, an uncle like that could easily turn into a ghost. Here, the ghost says it's lonely and coming to get him. I still think Barney's being haunted by Cole's ghost. No, definitely haunted. - Tabby. Sit down. Cole can't be a ghost. Because Cole isn't dead. I know, I know. We've known for a long time, anybody could deny that is, that Cole is still alive. He used to keep in touch with Barnaby. - Alive? You said he was- - Our mothers. But, oh, well. She must have made some sort of mistake. It was somebody else who drowned all those years ago. - Then. Then that means alive Cole is lonely and he's coming for my brother. He's chosen another Barnaby in the family to be his friend. - Forget about Cole, Tabby. He's in America somewhere. Barney's just another Scholar magician. - Barney doesn't want to be chosen. I'll have to warn him. I'll bet I'm right Granddad. I'm a novelist and I've got these instincts. - And I'm a Scholar, and I've got instincts, too. (waves crashing) (water dripping) (wind whispering) - [Tabitha] Barney! Barney, I've got something to tell you. Hi. What happened? - He's grown too powerful. He broke the mirror. - [Tabitha] How? - He doesn't need it anymore. He's here. - Listen. There isn't a ghost after you. Great Uncle Cole isn't dead. Aren't you surprised? (door rattling) (rain falling) Granddad found it, your lion. Look, maybe we can just make friends with him. He's a relation. - It's like suppose an earthquake or something smiling at you. You can't just smile back. - Well, if you won't tell Claire and you won't tell Dad, then let's at least go and tell Troy. Come on. (suspenseful music) (door opening) - What do you want? - Gosh. - [Troy] This is my private room. - How do you keep it so- - You don't have to come in if you don't like it. - Yes, I do, it's Barney. He's been all sort of haunted. Aren't you Barney? Barney, aren't you? Well, he is. It's all around him. Can't you hear it? - No. - But you've got to. - I don't hear anything. (phone ringing) - [Claire] Barney! It's for you. - I don't want it. - What on earth is wrong with everyone? - [Cole] Barney? I'm here. - Leave me alone. - [Cole] You've got to understand. When you see me perhaps. - Don't come. - [John] What's the fuss about? - Dad, Barney won't lead on in case he worries Claire. You know, with the baby coming and all and now he says Cole's here out there somewhere, outside. (indistinct) Well it's true. - [John] Look do us a favor, will you love? I mean ghosts, magicians, what do you take me for? Now you're just letting your imagination run with you. - [Claire] Well, that phone call was a man's voice. - Claire! Don't tell me you're starting to believe this stuff as well. Look, I freely admit the Scholar family are a strange lot, but this is ridiculous. - Well, something. Something has frightened him out of his wits. (eerie organ music) - Barney, it's only the wind, mate. - Don't go! - Oh, this is silly. I'm not frightened. Just angry. There's something out there or someone out there and he's not right. (thunder crashing) - Who's there? (water dripping) (electricity popping) - [Cole] Barnaby. You see. I'm not so terrible after all. - [John] What are you? - Nature's game and my mother's shame. - Look, we don't want any- - Careful. - Dad! - John! - [Tabitha] Dad! - I am not a monster. Why do you insist on treating me as if I were? I don't need much, but I've got to have something. At least one person, Barnaby's dead, you know. - But Barnaby's ours. - Yes, but you're going to have others. - He belongs here. - Don't try and stop me! - Cole! I knew it must be you. - Mother? - Leave that boy alone. - My childhood was taken from me. I'm taking the boy by way of payment. (lightning crashing) - You're not the only one who can control the elements. - You? You? You? You're what you punished me for being all those years? - That's how I know. It can be controlled you see. No one ever suspected. But you, you don't even try. - You disowned your power so it all came into me. I am your imagination set free in spite of you. - But that's not enough, is it? You want more, don't you? You want company. No one wants to stay alone with you. Just take a look at them. You make them afraid of you. You're alone in the darkness. Alone with your power. Now get out. - I'm not going to vanish again just to keep things tidy for you. I'm not gonna run or hide or be alone anymore. Nobody here, not you, not anyone can stop me from doing what I want to do. You burned my animals, you stole my childhood and I am taking this boy. (water crashing) (screaming) - Help me. - Don't, don't! I'll come with you. - No! No! - That's enough. It's not Barney. It's me. It's always been me. I never wanted to be like you. Let me be free. Let me be free. Let me be free. (electricity crackling) (gentle music) - In the end, my power became the only reason for my existence. I have never tried to be anything more than my talent. Well, I had to fight very hard just to save myself. - I know. My mother always made me promise to hide it. But if it's held in, it eats you up from inside. That's what it did to Great Granny. - Not to be the only one, that's a shock. And you. You're more powerful still. - It is exciting to really know what you are and then to be it. - How do I know what I am? - You're a magician. - Yes. Perhaps some day I can learn to be a great uncle as well as a magician. - Why not? You've got a whole family to be an uncle to. We've got to look after each other. - She loves you, then, this new mother of yours? - I suppose she does. Hey, look, I've got to push off now 'cause they get jumpy at the moment if any of us are late home. - I won't be far away. - I know. I always knew you were there. You were so unhappy. - Not anymore. - I know you're there. (gentle music) - Spinning the world? - It's just a game. - It's a dangerous game. Come on, come and have a swim with us. Come on. (children chattering) - Slow down mate. (indistinct) - I can hold my breath for a whole minute. - Well, I can do an absolute proper complete head over heels under the water. - Bet you can't. - Bet I can. (screaming) - Watch out! (laughing) (indistinct chattering) - I am not. - Don't worry. - I really know what I'm doing. - [Barney] Troy, did you bring Uncle Cole? - Not this time. - I'm still me. Don't go all cool with me. - I'm not. Oh. Darling Troy. - Sometimes I feel so sure and sometimes I'm so mixed up. - I don't know what to tell you. Yes, I do. See Cole, but set your exams. Take up jazz dancing. Don't let your power get the better of you. Take it easy and keep your balance. - I'll get by. (screaming) (water splashing) - [Claire] You all right? - [Troy] Yes. - Troy will be all right. Sometimes I know things. - What sort of things? - Nothing terrific, just ordinary things. - Like what? - I'm pretty sure your baby's gonna be a girl called Emma. - I didn't tell, oh, Barney. (screaming) - Hey, she can have my good luck lion. I don't need it anymore. - Let's just leave the new baby to be a surprise, okay. After all, there have got to be a few nice mysteries for us ordinary people to look forward to, don't there? (gentle music)
