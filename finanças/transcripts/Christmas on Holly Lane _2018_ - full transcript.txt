[Christmas music] [upbeat music] -I love Christmas. -Me too. Me three. -Warm cookies! I love you, Cat. -I hope they taste okay. Greatness! You're lucky, Sarah. I'm barely allowed in the kitchen at my house. We barely have a kitchen at mine. There's an empty spot. Where? Right there, it's totally naked. It's fine, not everything has to be perfect. You mean like Ethan? With the perfect eyes and the perfect smile. The perfect everything. You guys are so lame. Who are you going to the holiday dance with? Ethan, so it'll be a perfect Christmas. From my mom. -It's not Christmas yet. -They're for now, open them. She made these? Yeah, I told her neither one of you had stockings and she went all, "What? That sucks." Your mom said "sucks?" More-or-less. I translated. This is the sweetest thing anybody has ever done for me. Same here. But we don't have a fireplace. And we don't put up decorations. Guys, hello? They go up here next to mine. See? Like magic. We're family. Now, I'm going to cry. Me too. Me three. Promise we'll decorate the house every Christmas for the rest of our lives? Swear. [Sarah] Come on guys, let's finish the tree. [Cat] This is the most Christmassy house on Holly Lane. [Riley] In all of Kirkwood Falls. I'm thinking you and Ethan should have a Christmas wedding right here. My friends are coming in this weekend. They were like my besties growing up. It'll be nice to have everybody under one roof. It's been so long. Do they have to stay here? It's just one weekend. What? What if dad wants to move back in and they're here? Honey, your father and I have a lot to figure out. But he is coming back, isn't he? I certainly hope so. But it's not going to be this weekend. Goodnight. Love you. Love you too. Time to go. Ashley says it's no problem me spending the weekend while you're gone, Cat. I am not Cat, I'm Mom. Ashley calls her mother by her first name. Yeah, we're not doing that. So, what about this weekend? You wouldn't have to pay Mrs. Todd and it would be super cool. Ashley's parents own a home theater. You get to have fun with your friends, why can't I have some fun with mine? This trip isn't all about fun. Besides, I barely know Ashley's parents. Oh my God! I promise they're not drug dealers. Please? Okay, I'll talk to her mother. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Did I tell you her dad drives a Maserati? You've mentioned it. Hey, could we go shopping after school for shoes? Yes! That's why I am leaving work early. Oh, did I tell you that Ashley invited me to Maui for Christmas with her whole family? What? I know, right? Honey, I want to spend Christmas with you. Mom, I'm talking Hawaii. You'll be working, I'll be bored. I don't see the problem. Your not seeing the problem is the problem. Maui. [Riley] I need the numbers. You said they'd be ready today. Define soon. No, that doesn't work. Let me be clear. I'm on a plane 10 a.m. tomorrow morning. If I don't have the data tonight, you don't have a job on Monday. Thank you. What's this? Special delivery for Riley Nelson from Ryan Shaw. Do you want them? You don't? Why encourage him? I thought you liked him. Nice enough guy, no growth potential. Enjoy. Yo, Riley, where are we on Mayfield Snow? You will have the report on your desk first thing Monday. Any red flags? No. Sounds like a yes. It's just that this company has the potential of winding up like Cody International. We made quite a bundle off of... But there was a lot of... Jeez, Nelson, don't be such a girl. If you want to get called up to the majors, you're going to have to grow a pair. Hi. Hey chef, you're early. I want to get all of my prep done, so I can take Taylor to the mall. Uh, we have a problem. What? Chin's Seafood didn't deliver. What's going on with my seafood? They're being very small-minded. You sent them a check, right? Mason? I was sitting there with three jacks. Three! The guy across from me was showing nada. Your check bounced. What am I supposed to do about the delivery? I convinced Newman's to let me open an account. Newman's will deliver garbage if I don't go pick it out myself. Then go down. It's in Newport Beach, it'll take me half the day. I promised Taylor we'd go shopping later. She'll live. Mason, I'm her only parent. Quit using that excuse. [Ethan] Sarah, where do we keep the paintbrushes? They're in the same place they've been since we moved in. The basement cabinet. You're making dad fix another crack? I just want it to look nice for when Cat and Riley get here. You're, kind of overdoing it. Thank you, Hannah. I mean, who else other than your mother would notice this little, tiny, practically invisible, hairline crack? Can you drive me to school, dad? I'm sorry. I got to get to work and put up the Christmas decorations. Hey, you better hurry or you'll miss the bus. I'm worried about Hannah. She's doing all right. She's not. She misses her dad. I got to let this dry. I'll be back later to paint. ♪♪♪ It's just as I remember. Look at the trees. I miss the season. -Hey! -Hi, you're here. Hi. -I feel so much better now. -[Cat] Me too. [Riley] Me three. Get inside, it's cold. -[Riley] So? -[Sarah] You look great. -[Riley] You look great. -[Sarah] Both of you, come on. Wow, memories. You've made some changes. But it still feels the same. Like coming home. [Riley] I love that you still live here. Anchor in stormy seas. Is that as in, I stayed put while you two were off sailing on adventures? You heard me say stormy, right? Fifty-foot waves, itty bitty boat. Well, do you guys want to go downtown to Kirkwood Falls, see how much has changed? It has? No. Let's go. -Let's go. -Come on. [Riley] Christmas is in the air. It's my favorite time of year. Got to say, there's a distinctly different vibe here than LA. Must be the disconnect between surf boards and sleigh bells. Well, is-- let me guess, Santa comes in on a surfboard? I miss the snow. It makes everything clean again. [Riley] Sure does. -So pretty. -[Cat] Isn't it? Yeah. Our snow in New York, mm not so clean. [all laugh] I did. Dot's Cafe. Still standing. How many burgers and fries did we down at this place? [Riley] I'm pretty sure Big Pharma heard of us and invented statins. Get out! Is that Peyton Curzon? [Sarah] Peyton Clark now. -[Cat] As in Tommy Clark? -[Sarah] Mm-hm. Yep, she finally nailed him. Poor Tommy. She's had her sights set on him since the tenth grade. She hated you for dating him all through high school. She couldn't still hold that against me, could she? Please, that woman holds more beef than a meat locker. I've been drooling ever since you said fries. Let's go in. [Sarah] All right, fair warning, it's seen better days. What happened? Nothing, literally. [Riley] Sheesh! The menu hasn't changed either. Oscar's on-going love affair with saturated fats. Cat? Oscar! I didn't think you'd remember me. What, our best waitress ever? What are you doing here? Visiting my favorite peeps. Oh yes, the three amigas. So, nice to see you all together again. So, tell me, what are you up to these days? Head chef at a restaurant in LA. Head chef? I knew it. I just knew it! I taught her everything she knows. We thought we'd come in for a bite, for old time's sake. I'm glad you did because I might not be here next time you're in town. I bought a condo in Cape Coral. Nice. So, girls, what will it be? And it's on me. Do you really have to ask? Coming right up. Oh, he's still so sweet. [Oscar] Three Oscar Specials. -Thank you. -There go my hips. Enjoy. I can't believe we used to eat like this. Maybe we should pick up some kale on the way home, tell our stomachs we were just kidding about the fries. Well, well. What do you know? The living dead. Play nice. -Don't I always? -No. Peyton Curzon! Gosh! It's been forever. Riley, Sarah, Catherine. It's not Curzon. It's Clark. Oh, that's right, I heard that you landed Tommy. You here for lunch? Please, no. Just dropping off a business proposal. What are you two doing in town? Remembering old times. I would have thought you'd want to forget them. Forget her, the burgers are getting cold. How are things with you and Ethan? He moved out a few weeks ago. And you didn't call us on that day? [sighing] I was in shock. I still am. What happened? I don't know, a few months ago he started acting strange. Weird things like he started dressing better. Working out? "To protect his heart." At first, I didn't think anything of it and then one night he came home really late and I jokingly said something about him having an affair and then he just-- He didn't laugh. At all. I got chills and I thought maybe he really is having an affair, so I asked him. And he lied like a congressman? Nope, he fessed up. It's like he was almost relieved. How long has it been going on? Couple of months. Met some customer at work. And you kicked him to the curb that night, right? No, I mean, I was numb. He was the one that wanted time apart. I agreed. Sarah, that's awful. I mean the worst part about it is that I want him back. If he has any sense at all, he'll come crawling back. I say good riddance to bad news. He cheated on you. It hurts, it hurts a lot. I just hope he's home by Christmas for Hannah's sake. We're here for you, Sarah. So, what do you want to do? You want to go watch a movie? Maybe go to the mall? Get some gin and tonic and start cocktail hour early? You guys are going to think this is silly. We won't. I want to decorate the house for Christmas. I'm serious, my favorite childhood memories are Christmases with you guys. You're only here for the weekend. It's now or never. I vote for now. Two conditions. One, we don't play that schmaltzy Christmas music. Oh. Oh my gosh, fine. One condition. Cat bakes her Christmas cookies. Hey, you had me at schmaltzy Christmas music. Yah! ♪ Christmas time Is finally here ♪ ♪ Christmas time's My favorite time of year ♪ ♪ Christmas time So glad it's here ♪ ♪ Christmas time's My favorite time of year ♪ ♪ I can feel the joy At Christmas time ♪ ♪ Getting cozy by the fireside ♪ I can feel the cheer At Christmas time ♪ ♪ Singing yuletide Carols every night ♪ ♪ Christmas time Is finally here ♪ ♪ Christmas time's My favorite time of year ♪ ♪ Christmas time So glad it's here ♪ ♪ Christmas time's My favorite time of year ♪ ♪ I can feel the warmth At Christmas time ♪ ♪ Even when it's cold End sun don't shine ♪ ♪ I can feel the love At Christmas time ♪ ♪ Won't you join me sing And dance all night ♪ ♪ Christmas time Is finally here ♪ Hey, do you have our old stockings for the mantel? They are cleverly hidden in that box marked "Stockings." Box marked "Stockings." There we go. Strange, that's not how I remembered them. Now that tells you everything you need to know about Ethan's filing system. Talk about careless. Don't worry, the stockings are probably in a box somewhere marked "Trophies." Wow. Okay. [Riley] It's a little droopy on the right. [Cat] Careful. I know what I'm doing. -Okay. -All right, good. Now just come down. Be careful. Stop saying that, I'm fine. I just don't want you to get... hurt. Ow. [mumbling on speaker] Well, the good news, it's not broken. That's a relief. I'll wrap it, give you some crutches and you can be on your way. Okay. That's what I get for stringing Christmas lights. You have a house here? No, I'm visiting a friend. Sarah Michaels, over on Holly Lane? Your old hangout. How would you... Um, do I know you? We had honors English together. Three years running. Jake Allen. Wow, you really shot up! Late bloomer. Gained five inches in college. That's possible? Apparently. Wow. I'm glad I was on duty tonight. I've wanted to thank you for a long time. Thank me for what? Changing my life. Excuse me? I need to get that bandaged. I'll be right back. [Sarah] I feel terrible. [Cat] It's not like you pushed her off the roof. I can't remember what I have at home for pain. I'm sure the hospital will take care of it. There's a pharmacy down the hall. I'm just going to go grab something. [cell phone ringing] Taylor. Hello? Taylor? It was Debate Club. The subject: "Should community service be mandatory?" What side was I on? Pro. You made such a compelling case. Meet new people, learn new skills, broaden your horizons, make the world a better place. I spent that summer volunteering at a hospital. Here in Kirkwood Falls? Honduras. Wow, you took the "broaden your horizons" to heart. Because of you, I became a doctor. Because of me? Yep. Besides practicing here, I spend several weeks a year volunteering for Doctors Without Borders. So still broadening? Does as much for me as the people I help. Hmm. So, what have you been up to? Oh, so much. I live in New York. I help people do some things, improve their circumstances. So, social work? Oh, it can be social. If there's enough drinking. But let's not talk about work. Feels really good. It should be good in no time. Okay. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Are you having fun at Ashley's? Who else is there? Those don't sound like girls' voices. You didn't tell me about any party and that there would be boys there. Put Ashley's mother on the phone. Did I just hear somebody say "Pass me a beer?" Are you kids drinking? Taylor! Taylor! [phone hanging up] Ethan? Sarah! What are you doing here? Is Hannah okay? Hannah's fine, Riley sprained her ankle. What're you doing here? I umm just grabbing some stuff. Ethan, I got it. I really don't think the second test is necessary, but the pharmacist claims it's the most reliable brand, so... Hi, I'm Britney. You want to explain? Hey. You okay? Yeah, just a sprain. Why do you two look like somebody stole your puppy? My 13-year-old daughter is at an unsupervised party with boys and beer. Yikes. My husband's girlfriend is pregnant, so I imagine marriage counseling won't work. Are you kidding me? And I feel like my entire life has been a waste. I don't know about you, but I could stand to drown some sorrows. -Me too. -Me three. What'll it be, ladies? Wine, ice cream, fries? -Yes. -All of it. Yeah, all of it. [Christmas music] [Sarah] I wish that you guys lived closer. You know, I didn't even want to move to L.A. It was Nick's idea. Really? It looks so inviting every time I watch it on the Rose Parade. There's two seasons: fire and floods. The traffic is a nightmare and the smog in the sky looks like muck. But what really worries me is Taylor, or rather her friends. Kids have phases. No, it's not that. Her friends' parents are one percenters. All the kids, they have credit cards. And they vacation in Italy and Maui. And Taylor buys into all of it. Well, at least you have a job that you like. I work for a degenerate gambler who raids the till to fund his love of "Texas Hold-'Em." You're a great chef, you'll find another job. Nick and I were so close to opening our own place. That was always the dream. At least your job makes people happy. You know what I do? Look for companies to rape and pillage. It can't be that bad. I'm good at what I do, but I hate what I do, but if I didn't do what I do, what would I do? Say that three times fast. I'm serious. I have locked that in a box and hid it from myself for so long and then talking to Jake about all that he's done with his life just opened it up and shined a light right in there. How am I supposed to tell Hannah that not only is her dad not coming home for Christmas, he's spending it with his other family? She's thirteen. He could text her. There's no easy way, Sarah. I just hate Ethan for doing this. As you should. There's no other option, we're getting a divorce. I have to sell the house. What? No. No. All of our money is tied up in this. I can't buy him out. But this is our house, too. We can't let that happen. I don't have a choice. This is going to be the last Christmas on Holly Lane. -I don't want to drink to that. -I know. [Riley] Morning. Morning. Coffee's made. How long have you been up? Couple hours. Did somebody say coffee? I'm making some more. Well, you better step on it because we have to get dressed and get going. I hate peppy morning people. I've been thinking about your problem. You're going to kill Britney for me? No. Ethan? Sorry, I haven't figured out a way to fix that yet. I meant Cat. My problem? Which one? All of them. The answer is right around the corner. [Riley] Well, what do you think? [Cat] I think you're two tacos short of a combo meal. Let's consider. You hate your job, your boss, the drive, Los Angeles, and all of that loathsome sunshine. Ours not to reason why. Two, you're worried it's warping your daughter's values. And three, you've always wanted to own your own restaurant. She was captain of the debate team. Let's check it out. [murmuring] Well? [Cat] The equipment is in good shape. But? It's fine. Fine? We're not talking about fine. We're talking about your dream. I'd want to put in a pizza oven and open the kitchen wall to the rest of the dining area. So, we could open up some walls. What about this room? Well it's like me, it could use a facelift. Paint, new tables, flooring. What if you moved the main entrance to the back, off the main road? Yeah, and maybe we could put in a bar. Give it a gastropub feel. I love that. So? I can see it. Peyton Clark dropped off a business proposal yesterday. She's after me to list the place, says she has a buyer. To do what? Says there's money in parking lots. They would demolish this place? If Cat bought it, it would be like keeping it in the family. You can afford to do this, Cat? Ha. I plan to line up an investor. What I need from you, Oscar, is a fair price. Keeping in mind that if you sell to us, you wouldn't need to pay any realtor's commissions. Peyton will turn blue and implode. Yeah. Do you want to sit down and talk about it? Okay. [Riley] Okay, assignments. Sarah, I want you to find a contractor to check out the building. Cat, draw up some sample menus with price points. I'm going to write the business plan. You really think you can talk your boss into funding this? [Riley] If the numbers are solid. We're moving too fast. We wait, and your dreams become a parking lot. I've never done anything like this. That's the point. This is your chance. You just have to ask yourself. Two years from now, do you want to be in L.A. working for someone else, or do you want to be out here with your own place? And then there's this. Sarah gets to have one of her best buds back in town, and I get to help a friend realize her dream. Could Taylor and I stay with you at first? Yes of course, as long as I have the house. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. Your BFF's gone? Yeah, it's already too quiet around here. Why don't you sit down? Have some tea? Uh, oh. Now what? Well, a couple of things. One of them is good. Cat and Taylor might be coming to stay with us for a little while. What? When? I'm not sure, maybe soon. For how long? I'm not sure about that either. What about dad? About your dad. I cannot believe you actually went into Ashley's house and made a scene. And I can't believe Ashley's mom was actually home. And it wasn't a scene, it was a discussion. And it doesn't matter anyway because you are never going back there. And you are certainly not going to Maui for Christmas with those people. You're insane. No one else is in trouble. I don't care about anybody else. I care about you. I hate you. [slamming door] [Sarah] It's going slower than I thought. An idea for the story? Gosh, you know what? The thing is I really don't like to talk about it until the idea is fully formed. Just hang tight, you're going to love it. Okay. Chef? What's the matter? You're going to have to change the menu again. More vendor problems? Afraid so. [text alert] Thanks to your excellent report we are moving ahead on Mayfield Snow. Great. I have something else for you to consider. What's this for? A restaurant. Pass. You're not even going to look? Do you know what the failure rate on restaurants is? The start-up is nothing, it's a drop in the bucket. Do you know how you get a full bucket? By not making dumb investments. We have a great location, a great chef. The numbers are solid. We? What is this, a personal project? It's a safe investment, sir. So are CDs at one and a half percent. Not our business model. No, our model is to find distressed companies, screw the workforce, cannibalize the parts, suck it dry and collect a fat management fee. Vulture capitalism at its best. [Riley] I've got good news and bad news. Bad news first. My boss turned down the proposal. What's the good news? I got fired. Fired? How is that good news? I get a honking big severance check. Okay, so yay? Yes, yay. I'm going to finance your restaurant. Riley, you can't. For once I want to put my money into something I believe in. And I believe in us. That is, if you'll have me as a partner. But you're risking your money. You cook the food. I'll cook the books. Kidding, people. I think you need to work on your delivery. One more thing. What's that? I'm going to need a place to stay until we get this thing going. So, Sarah, got room for one more? With one caveat. Ethan hired a real estate agent to list the house. Do you want to guess who? Ugh. What a truly lovely home you have. Thank you. And so merry. Despite the circumstances. Needless to say, I'm sorry. [Sarah] Uh-huh. Beautiful stonework. My grandfather actually did that himself when he built the house. Your grandparents lived here before your parents? They did. Perfect! I can advertise it as first time on market. Any idea how quickly it'll sell? You only need one buyer. However, I do have a few suggestions that will help. Okay. First, you need to declutter. Declutter? Mm. Make it less personal. It is personal. It's my home. The fewer photos and mementos you have on display, the easier it is for buyers to envision themselves being here and not you. As for the holiday decorations... They're staying. Of course. But you may want to pull back a little. You don't want the place looking like a bad Christmas sweater. I like Christmas sweaters. I think they're fun. Whatever, at least Ethan has his things out, so your closets look spacious. Keep them that way. Not likely. I'm getting roommates. Who? Taylor. I'm not moving! -Taylor. -I'm not! My job is in jeopardy. So? Find another one. I did, in Kirkwood Falls. This is a really big opportunity for me. Well, it stinks for me. One of the reasons I'm doing this is so that we can spend more time together. Big whoop. Well, I would like that. Well, I wouldn't if it means living in stupid Kirkwood Falls. You can't make me go! Taylor, look. Doesn't the house look so pretty with all the lights and decorations? I was supposed to be in Maui, not Suckwood Falls. I'm not really feeling the joy. [Sarah] Hi, welcome! Remember me? Taylor, do you remember Riley and Sarah? She's the one that wrote all the Woof and Luce books you like. When I was five. Uh, this is Hannah. You guys will be sharing a room. Sharing? Wow, this just keeps getting better. Not forever. Just until I help your mom get the restaurant up and running. The restaurant could burn to the ground for all I care. Taylor. What? It's your dream, not mine. I need to pee. It's a big change for her. And not for me? Merry Christmas, one and all. [Cat] Could you bring the bags in, please? [taxi driver] Sure thing. [Sarah] It's going to be balmy in here. ♪♪♪ That wall isn't load-bearing. Moving things around won't be a problem. Good, because I have one tiny little wrinkle. There's always a wrinkle. We really need to open before Christmas. Before Christmas? We need a revenue stream, streaming. Is that possible? Anything's possible. Do you want it fast, cheap, or good? All three? [man] Sorry, you only get two. If you want it good and fast, it won't be cheap. And if you want it cheap and good, it won't be fast. And if you want it fast and cheap, it won't be good. Well, it has to be on budget, and it has to be on time. [man] I'll make it as good as I can. [Riley] Okay. [man] I'll call you in a few hours. Why do I get the feeling this is going to be slow, costly, and bad? [Riley] Bite your tongue! Riley? Oh hey, Jake. -What's going on? I heard Oscar sold the place. -Yeah, to us. How's the ankle? Great, yeah. You must've had a great doctor. I did, thank you. So what're you doing in town? We are doing so much, it's a little bit complicated. Why don't you explain it over dinner? Dinner? How about tonight? Umm, I would love to. We have to... Um, but we... we're going to meet Susie, but we have this-- I can totally take care of that thing. Don't worry about the thing, we don't need her at the thing. Thanks, Sarah, Cat. Good to see you both. So? Dinner? Sure, why not? Dinner. Can I pick you up? Uh, I'll meet you there. How about Sunsinger's at eight? Great. See you at eight. Great. -Bye. -[Sarah] Bye! What're you doing? We're trying to help you. Yeah, he's nice. Too nice! Why do I want to spend time with someone that makes me feel bad for not being Mother Teresa? Because you like him! You don't know that, okay? So you two need to stop meddling. ♪♪♪ [waitress] I'll be back with you... I'm guessing that wasn't up to New York City standards. I don't know, the miso roasted Brussel sprouts were pretty great. Have you noticed how Brussel sprouts were universally despised until two years ago and now they're the cool kids on the plate? Yeah, it's like they shed their nerdiness and showed up at their class reunion driving Ferraris. I'm so glad I didn't pick you up tonight in my not-a-Ferrari. Well, that's not important to me. It's a hybrid electric. Of course it is. More wine? I better not, I have to drive home. You haven't even touched yours. I'm on call. So why did you order it? So, you wouldn't feel bad drinking alone. Please tell me there's at least one thoughtless, irresponsible thing that you do. Just one. I hate to admit how often I've gone to the grocery store and forgotten to bring my own bags. [Cat] This string of lights looks good. Okay. You know what? Let's be sure to check for duds. Good idea, we don't want to get all the way to the top and discover we have a bad bulb. You're supposed to start at the top. What? Stringing the lights. Starting at the bottom is wrong. Hannah-- Dad always starts at the top. We'll start at the top. I don't want to do this anyway. Do whatever you want. [exhaling] She normally does the tree with Ethan. If she doesn't have to do this, I shouldn't have to do it either. [Riley] So you're going back to the hospital tonight? We're short-handed. Why's that? Little bit of a hard time recruiting good help. Most doctors want to practice in a big city. You're here. I like Kirkwood Falls. It's my way of giving back. Thank you. It's your fault for giving that damn make a difference speech when I was young and impressionable. I guess now is not the best time to tell you that I just wanted to win. Mm. Not surprising for a future private equity hot shot. Google. Don't believe everything you read on the internet. But it fits with what I remember about you from high school. Which is what? Smart, focused, confident... Go on. And, as we used to say back in the day, absolutely fly. Are you sure you didn't sneak a little slurp of that wine on the side? Sober as a judge. Mm-hmm. You are crazy. Thank you. I had a great time. Me too. Well, this is me. How about we do this again Friday? Wow, you don't waste much time, do you? Not anymore. That's another thing I learned from you. Really? I spent the summer after 12th grade kicking myself for never saying anything to you when I had the chance. What did you want to say? [Sarah] He kissed you? So you do like him? He's got some short-term potential. Why short-term? Duh, I live in New York? Why aren't the girls helping with this? Unfortunately, that required being in the same room as us. Right. Cat, there's a naked spot right there. [hammering] [power saw cutting] Wow, you have made progress. Doing my best. I found a range over in Milford, but they need to deliver next week. We can have the kitchen ready. Really? Count on it! Thanks. What are you doing? Taping drywall. Do you like it when people look over your shoulder while you're cooking? Well, is that person being a nuisance, or are they trying to learn? Fair enough. I put down about an eighth of an inch to make sure there are no dry spots. Dry spots give you bubbles. Don't want bubbles. No, ma'am. So, you still have your antlers? What? You don't remember me, do you? Should I? I used to come in here when you waitressed. You'll have to imagine me as an obnoxious 13-year-old. Oh, now you look familiar. I would always try and get your table. Well yeah, the other waitress was eighty-seven. Every year for Christmas, Oscar would dress up as Santa, and you'd wear reindeer antlers. Oh, yeah. I don't know how you made those things look sexy, but you did. Well, every thirteen-year-old boy thinks everything is sexy. I'm glad you're bringing the place back to life. Of course, if the Oscar Special isn't still on the menu, I'm not coming. Duly noted. I'm only interested in companies that want to do well by doing good. Is the interview with a partner? [Josh] I'll check. Let me know. Will do. -Okay, bye. -Bye. Hey. Hey! -You got a minute? -Sure. So I was at my attorney's office and I met another woman who's in the middle of a divorce. She's desperate for financial advice. Her husband handled everything, and she is admittedly clueless. She's willing to pay. It's you, right? Please, as if Ethan handled anything. -Oh, good point. -Ellen... This is Riley Nelson, Ellen Singer. You're going to be in good hands. -Hi! -Hi. -Nice to meet you. -You too. Have a seat. -I brought a few records with me. -Okay. Oh, Catherine. Peyton. I'm just checking to see that the renovations are going okay. It's great, thank you. You've taken on a risky project. Look Peyton, I know you wanted the building. I'm simply worried that you moved here only to lose everything. Well, not everything. Even if the restaurant fails, we'll still have the building. That's not your deal. Didn't Riley tell you? [Cat] You don't own the building? I don't have enough money. What about big honking check? Not big enough to buy the building, pay for renovations, and keep us afloat until we generate some income. I negotiated a lease with the option to buy later. Why didn't you tell me? Because it doesn't change anything for you. It changes everything for you! What if we fail? What're you going to fall back on? My considerable wit and charm. I'm serious. Cat, I know what's at stake. All that I ask is that if we go down, we go down swinging. It's going to be fine. [birds chirping] -Hi. -Hi. Your timing is perfect. Between restaurant paperwork, setting up a website, sending out resumes, teaching divorced housewives how to invest-- I'm exhausted just listening to you. A ride in the country sounds heavenly. Does your fuel-efficient car have reliable heat? Oh, this isn't the ride. This is just the ride to the ride. Okay. ♪♪♪ I should've known you'd find something even more environmentally friendly. Are you warm enough? Maybe I should turn the heat up. It's beautiful. Such a beautiful day. -Thanks. -Thanks a lot for coming in. -Hi. -Hi. These came for you. You have to change your address. Right. I don't know how your baseball trophies ended up with the Christmas decorations, but... Uh, you-- you made me take them off the bookshelf when you put them up last year and then I just threw them in the nearest box, I guess. I think this is what you're looking for. The Christmas stockings are in here. Yeah, it is. Oh, wow. I wondered what happened to him. Do you remember him? No. It was the first Christmas after we were married. We were living paycheck to paycheck. I hadn't sold a children's book yet. We hardly had any Christmas decorations and I saw him, and I fell in love. And I said we couldn't afford him. Yeah, but then you went back and bought him and there he was, under the tree on Christmas Eve. What happened to us? I just... Help me understand. Sarah, I'm sorry. I am. But it's over and you need to move on. I'm an idiot. [Cat] No, you're not. You're big-hearted and always see the best in people. Like I said, idiot. You know how a liar always thinks that everybody else is lying? You're the opposite. Because you're decent, you think that everyone else will be as well and, they're not. Well, I need to change so quick. Teach me to be mean and deceitful. Don't ever lose that goodness, Sarah. That's why you write such sweet children's books. Just see people for who they are, not who you want them to be. Well, I know who you guys are. You're my friends! Come here! [Peyton] Look how spacious the kitchen is! The cupboards and the sink will have to go. -I like my kitchen! -Me too. [woman] And we will definitely need new countertops. [man] Whatever. The kitchen is yours, babe. Have at it. [laughing] Oh! Great place, really. Yeah, it's charming in a woodsy kind of way. -Thanks. -We'll give you some space. [Peyton] Just down the hall. Here, right in here. They hate my house. Good. [man] You know what would look good above the fireplace? A seventy-inch flat screen. [woman] All that ugly stonework? -[man] We'd rip that out. -[woman laughing] My grandfather built that! I know. [man] I wish there was an exercise area. What about in the kid's room? You could put your treadmill and your weights up there. Add a TV and you can make it your man cave. [woman laughing] Man cave. Do you have one of those now? Can you pick up your crap? Hey! Don't touch my stuff. Put it away then, it's getting filthy. My stuff, my problem. My room, my problem. And you're on my bed! Why is this out? It's mine. I just tried it on! Jeez, what's your problem? Hey. Girls! There are people downstairs. [Peyton] So what do we think? [man] Babe, I think it's the best one we've seen and we're on a deadline. Okay, I can make it work. We do have one more house to visit. -Well, then let's go! -Let's go. -[woman] Thank you! -[Peyton] You're welcome. Well, they're gone. You want some hot chocolate? Do we have marshmallows? Indeed we do. I'm sorry it's been so difficult with Taylor. Mom? Yeah? Am I the reason dad left? No, of course not. You sure he didn't just get tired of being my dad? He adores you, honey. He didn't even ask about putting up the tree this year. He feels guilty. And we haven't gone ice skating together since. I think it's easier for him to stay away than to face his feelings. Did you know Taylor's dad? What was he like? He was fun and funny. And he loved Cat and doted on Taylor. Taylor didn't want to move here. I know. I don't want to move, either. I know. I love this house. I do too. But you know what the best thing about this house is? What? That you're here. A house is special because of the people living inside it. And I love you so much. No matter where we end up it will be home because you'll be there. I love you. I love you. ♪♪♪ Hey. I don't care about Hannah, or you, or my mother's restaurant, or this stupid house. That's a lot to not care about. I hate it here. I don't know why my mother did this to me. She wants to give you something she never had. A crappy life? You think this is bad? Yeah. Has your mother ever told you about her life growing up? Some cousin took her in when her parents died. And? And when she grew up, she moved away. Okay well, let me fill you in. Those cousins were her only living relatives and they took her in, so I give them points for that, but they were never family. They never celebrated any birthdays, came to any school plays, took her on trips. They never made her feel wanted. No hugs, no kisses. Could you imagine? She was nothing but an inconvenience to them. She was miserable. I knew that the first time I met her. Unhappy kids can spot each other. Why were you miserable? Alcoholic parents who couldn't hold down jobs and whose idea of family time was throwing things at each other. I wanted to punch out the world and Cat was curled in a fetal ball. And then Sarah came along and somehow made friends with both of us. And Sarah's mom, who in my books should be put up for sainthood, made us feel at home here. We celebrated every birthday, every holiday, and Christmas. Cat and I never really had a Christmas until we came here. So, yeah, this place is special for us. This house is our safe place. And I think your mom came here hoping that you could have a safe place, too. Do you understand? Hey. Hey, yourself. I saw the light on, wondered who was here. Just me trying to get done on time, under budget. What are you doing wandering the streets on a cold night? Feeling anxious, I just started driving. Anxious about? The restaurant opening. You can cook, right? Yes. Then people will come. I can't wait for word of mouth. We need to make a splash. We're opening next week right before Christmas. Everybody's already so busy. So make it a Christmas party. It's your gift to the town. It's all shiny and new. Yeah! Dot's Cafe was a great old restaurant, Cat's Cafe will be a great new restaurant. That's the spirit. Spirit. That's it! What's it? Christmas Past and Christmas Future. All right. Oh! It snowed while we were eating. Nothing compares to leaving footprints in fresh snow. It says "I was here." But then it melts and gets slushy and ruins your shoes. So, glass half empty. Good to know. -When does Cat's place open? -Soon, thank goodness. Worried about your investment? Mm. And my life. It's time for me to get back to New York. What's your hurry? I've got some headhunters dangling opportunities for me. Our hospital could use a fundraiser. -How much does it pay? -Six figures. Really? The last two come after the decimal point. Oh, so I would have to live in my car? -You'd save on furnishings. -[laughing] I'll hate to see you go. It's not like I won't be back. You'll have a new job, be busy. -We can do FaceTime. -FaceTime isn't face time. You have done fine without me all this time. I'm not worried about you. I am. -Jake. -You have energy. I love how you make things happen. New York doesn't need you, we do. I do. Jake, I'm sorry. I just don't think it's a good idea. I'm-- I'm really sorry. Why not? [exhaling] We live hundreds of miles apart in every possible way. Everyone will be decked out for Christmas, and on the menus one side will be Christmas Past with a few of the old favorites Oscar used to offer. And on the other, Christmas Future: everything I'll be preparing. It's a celebration of what's been and what's yet to come. Great! Let's get started on the design. [door closing] [Riley] Hello? We're in here. -Hey. -How was your date? Umm... I think it's time to move on. Why? What's wrong with Jake? I'm just not interested. You're not attracted to him? I didn't say that. -What, he's no fun? -He's very fun. Too needy? He's annoyingly well-adjusted. Sarah, I think it's time we stage an intervention. A what? Riley, you find something wrong with every guy you date. I offer evidence: Rick, Vincent, Ryan, Jimmy. I mean that's just from Easter. Loser, loser, sociopath, loser. Really, everyone? Are you sure you haven't let a few good guys slip past you? Better to be single than in a bad relationship. You know what they do. Riley, not every relationship is going to end up like your parents'. Says the woman who's in the middle of a divorce. Not fair, Sarah and Ethan were good for each other when they were young. She grew up, he didn't. I hate how that turned out. I hate it, but I have good memories and I have a beautiful daughter. We're not saying Jake is the guy, but instead of thinking about everything that's wrong, maybe you should start thinking about what's right. I just don't want to make a mistake. Well, just don't let that mistake be trying so hard not to be your parents that you pass up a real chance at happiness. ♪♪♪ Santa. Chef. -Ready to open? -Got to be. Have fun, keep an eye on each other, and cover where needed. If things jam up, I can always pour some coffee and water. Showtime. -Break a ladle. -Back at you. Where is Sarah? She has to take care of something first. Welcome to Cat's Cafe. What's so important you had to tell me in person? Our daughter. What happened? Hannah thinks that she's the reason why you left. Ah, that's crazy. It's how she feels. I'll talk to her. You have to do more than just talk, Ethan. You can't take the easy way out this time. This time? Just like this affair, I mean you say you weren't even looking for it-- I wasn't, it just happened! Because you let it happen. You could've said no, it was too easy though. Are you going to be like this every time we meet? No, I'm not. The past is the past and you can own up to it or not. -But moving forward-- -What? Our daughter needs to know by word and deed that her dad loves her. Of course I love her. Well, you've dropped the ball lately. She's feeling neglected. Okay? Just saying. ♪♪♪ -Can I offer you ladies a refill? -No, thanks. We love the new menu. The ahi tuna with cranberry salsa was amazing. And look at the dessert, an ice cream snowman. It's almost too cute to eat. Almost! Be sure to tell all your friends. I will, just like I've told Jean and Barbara here about you. Now they both want to see you about their investments. Well, Ellen has my number, so give me a call. Thank you. Thought I would bring these myself. Two Oscar specials. -Nice touch. -All those fancy dishes. You sure these are real genuine Oscar specials? Had to leave it on the menu. Somebody made me promise. You didn't sneak anything healthy in here, did you? I knew he'd embarrass me. I'm betting he was one of your obnoxious buddies growing up? Still is, apparently. Well? It's even better than I remember. Probably because it is better. You were right about her, Rocky. Right about what? Well, you know, way back when he always had to sit at your table because he was crushing on you. He says you're even nicer now. And you're even dumber! Jury's still out on you, but I think he's nice, too. Wow. Right? Awesome arugula flatbread. It looks just like a Christmas tree. [man] I know. And those Gingerbread cookies, I don't know what she puts in them! [Peyton] She's a top chef from LA. Kirkwood Falls has so much to offer! Oh, Peyton. Oh. Didn't expect to see you here. You haven't returned my calls. What could I do? I've been busy. Look, I just thought as long as you're still in town, maybe we could-- Really, really busy. Have I done something wrong? Jake, no. I think you're great. Really, really great. It's me. Please, not the "it's not you, it's me" speech. The debate team captain can do better than that. Seriously, I have a problem. I can't help finding fault with anyone I date. -Really? -Yeah. -Even me? -Mm-hmm. Okay, so what are my faults? Well. Go ahead, just for fun. Okay. You're pushy, like now. Wall Streeters admire pushy. It's out of place in Kirkwood Falls. Fair enough. Next. You're a late bloomer. You grew five inches in college. I think your genes are on hyperdrive so you're probably going to age prematurely. That's reaching. Be real. You have a savior complex. Excuse me? Help this, volunteer that, end evil. And all for free! It's wearing. You're upset because I'm not out to make a zillion bucks? Yes! I don't consider it a virtue not to care about money. It's irresponsible. Okay. Pushy, a do-gooder, apparently too tall, and insufficiently enamored with money. But I have one big plus. What's that? I think you're terrific. I'm not! I'm overbearing, obsessed with winning, bossy-- That's all kind of one and the same. Impatient, controlling, outspoken, and sometimes snippy. Mm-hmm. A little bit. Are you done? Because you missed one. -What's that? -It doesn't matter because you don't scare me. Nobody's perfect. Were you listening to anything I said? Yes, and you have convinced me of one thing. Maybe if you were a little easier on yourself, you could be easier on others, too. I need to get to the hospital to do good and stuff. So, he's handsome, fun, smart, well-adjusted, knows you better than you know yourself, and you're afraid of making a mistake? I rest my case. I can never get the corners right. Here. Press in at the side instead of taking it from the top. I'll use gift bags. [knocking on door] -Dad. -Hi, honey. Mom's not here. I know, I just talked to her on the phone. I thought you might like to go skating. -Really? -Yeah, Mom signed off. Go grab your skates. -Umm... -What? Would it be okay if Taylor came with us? -If she wants. -Want to? No, it's okay, you should spend time with your dad. I will be spending time with him and you. I don't have skates. We can rent some. -Ever been ice-skating? -No. We'll teach you. Come on! If dinner goes as well as lunch, we're going to have to consider franchises. One good afternoon does not a successful restaurant make. No. It was such a big crowd. And they loved the food. I guess I'm a little optimistic. Where are you going? I got a house call to make. -Hey. -Hey. It's cold out, what're you doing? Waiting for you. What's up? I just had to know. What did I leave out? What fault? You mean besides your glaring commitment issues? Okay, besides that. You're germophobic. No, I'm not. Come on. You back out of doors instead of using the exit bar. You flip light switches with your elbows. You probably own stock in Purell. Would I do that if I was afraid of germs? You really do insist on winning every argument, don't you? Maybe just a little. [Cat] Sarah, you should have been there! Dinner was even busier than lunch. -[Riley] We nearly ran out of food! -[Cat] Yeah. That's great. [Riley] What's the matter? Peyton called. The couple that wants to gut the kitchen and tear down the fireplace, basically erase my history from this house, put in an offer. Full asking price. Oh, Sarah. I had to sign it. I just don't have it in me to take it to Ethan's. I'll take it to him for you. Thanks. I'm going to turn in. I'll get everything ready for the weekend. Christmas. I wish we could just skip it. Good night. I never thought I would hear Sarah say that. I wonder if Santa has room in his bag for a whole house. ♪♪♪ Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. -What time is it? -Time for presents! Let's start with stockings. You first, Mom. It's from all of us. -All of you? -That's right. We all pitched in. I don't get it. It's the sales contract from the house. Ethan tore it up. What? I got to thinking. If Cat, Taylor and I continue to live here but pay you rent, you'll be able to cover your mortgage and pay Ethan out over time. But you're going back to New York. Thing is, I like it here. And I'll be able to keep an eye on my investment, plus there's a lineup of women who want me to advise them on their finances. So, I'm going to get by. Getting by doesn't sound like Riley Nelson. I've come to realize that this place has a lot to offer. Including a certain insufferably big-hearted doctor? We all have our faults. They asked us first and we're totally on board, even though Taylor and I have to keep sharing. I like it. How could I annoy her if I was in a different room? Ethan, he agreed to all this? He said to tell you that signing the contract would have been easier, but he's learned that just because something is easy doesn't make it right. I can't believe that you guys did this for me. We did it for all of us. [Riley] Yes. This house has always felt like our home, too. That's because it is. ♪♪♪ I know, it was the worst. Mom, the tree looks fine. There was a naked spot. Ho ho ho. -Hot apple cider, anyone? -[Sarah] Thank you! Merry, merry! Hi! Whoa, what did you do? Rob a UPS truck? It's Christmas, I'm allowed to get carried away. Mom, can we go skating later? I thought we could take a sleigh ride. Let's do both. Sarah, come to the rink with us? Oh, I don't know. Come on, you might meet somebody nice. Yeah, Mom. It's not like that guy is going to just knock at our door. [knocking on door] Maybe that's Santa. Is this The House on Holly Lane? Really, truly? Annie Jane, I told you to wait. I'm sorry, this is embarrassing. We were out walking and my daughter couldn't believe that there was a road named Holly Lane. For the last month I have been reading her the same book every night over and over. The House on Holly Lane! The cover has a drawing of a house that looks just like yours.

We moved in Friday, next road over. Just the two of you? Yes, single dad working on teaching his daughter some impulse control. How about a cup of hot cider? -Um... -We couldn't impose. Yeah actually, we have-- we have a thing? Oh yeah, the thing. You know it's cancelled? Yeah, forget about the thing. Besides it's not imposing, it's sharing. And what a sweet Christmas memory it would be for your daughter. Well there's always room for more happy memories in this house. Come on in. Dad, it is the house! Those are the magic stockings.
