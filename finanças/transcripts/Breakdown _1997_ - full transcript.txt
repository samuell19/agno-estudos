Jesus! Asshole. See that? He pulled out in front of me. I only took my eyes off the road for a second. May be it's time to take a break. Yeah. We'll pull over soon. Nice car. Thanks. You have air, CD... Leather. Looks like you sprung for the whole 9 yards. I guess so. But that rig of yours is what you really need out here. Why have that piece of shit when you got this? What a man needs out here is a CB radio. Is that right? If you see a CB, you need a handle. Yours could be "Shit-for-Brains." Do you even care that you damn near killed us? I didn't see you. You pulled out in front of me. Like hell I did. Let's just forget this. I'm sorry. I don't want any trouble. No, I'll bet you don't. Howdy, Ma'am. You should be more careful who you ride with. - What was that about? - Nothing. He thinks I tried to hit him. Let's go. Should I drive? Later. Just get in. - If I promise not to sideswipe? - Just get in. I'm kidding. Getting ready for the Grand Prix? What'd you get? A junk food fiesta. Let's see. Snow Balls. Yoo Hoo. And Moon Pies. You believe they still make this stuff? Gourmet cuisine around here. This is crazy. Look at this. It says if you win this mail-in contest,... You can choose between $90,000 or 90,000 donuts. What would you do with 90,000 donuts? Sell them for 30 cents each and pay off this car. No kidding. $90,000. That'd solve some problems. What the hell? What did you do? Nothing. Hang on. I can't steer. Out of range? So much for taking the scenic route. The baffle gasket's burned out. What? It's connected to the connecting rod. Shut up. Can you believe this? This could be our worst decision ever. What are you doing? Just listen. We're changing jobs. Our finances are pretty fucked. And we're in the middle of the nowhere. I'd say this is our worst decision ever. Get out of here. You're bugging me. Okay, sweetie. Good luck. I'm going to California. Just leave me the Moon Pies. Jeff? And the donuts. No, there's a car. Christ, not these guys. Assholes. Jeff. What the hell... - What's he doing? - I don't know. This isn't good. Hi. Are you okay? Fine. Except our car broke down. I saw that. Can I give you a hand? Thanks. Honey, you steer. Massachusetts plates. You folks on vacation? No, we are moving. Oh yeah? Whereabouts? San Diego. Do you think we can use your CB radio a tow truck? No, it blew a fuse this morning. I'll fix it at the truck stop. How far is that? About 60 miles. I was just driving along and she quit on me. Belts... Battery's working. You used to give these things a kick and they'd start. It is a new car. That could be it. Have you been riding it pretty hard? Yeah, I admit a little... Tell you what. I'll give you a ride to Belle's Diner. You can call a tow truck from there. That's nice of you to offer, but I think you got it. We'll just let her cool off. Thanks. We appreciate it. Good luck starting it. - Thanks. - Thanks a lot. Honey. It's probably just overheated. What's if it's not? We don't want to be stuck out here. No, but if we let it cool off, we'll be okay. It's getting toasty. Sure you want to blow this ride? No, but... I don't want to leave the car. What if I call the tow truck, and order an iced tea? And I stay with the nice hot car. Right. Right. You'll be okay? I'll be fine. Excuse me. Can I take you up on that ride? Sure. Step up. Sure your husband doesn't want to come? No, he'll stay with the car. What the hell? Tow truck, my ass. BELLE'S DINER Excuse me. I'm supposed to meet my wife here. She's dark-haired, about 5'5". Wearing a white Benetton sweater. White what? Benetton sweater. Hank! Your order's up. I'm busy here. People come and go. Within the last half hour. Maybe with a trucker. Trucker? A guy driving an 18 wheeler. Doesn't ring a bell. You sure? This man's looking for his wife. Dark hair, a white button on sweater. Travelling with a trucker. Anybody seen 'em? Looks like she got away from you, cowboy. Maybe she left a message with one of your employees. No.. I'm the only one that works here. Is there another Belle's Diner? No siree. Definitely not. Excuse me. We must have gotten our signals crossed. How far is the next town? 20 miles. Do me a favor. If my wife, Amy comes in... tell her I was here and to stay put till I get back. Would you do that, please? Okay. Thanks. Hey! Pull over! Pull over. I don't believe it. Jesus! Christ. Hey, man. What are you doing? I wanted you to pull over. You didn't see me? Yeah. Well? Never mind. I'm looking for my wife. What? Where's my wife? How should I know? I'm the guy with the Jeep. You gave me my wife a ride to Belle's Diner. Not me. Sorry. Sorry? This was a half hour ago. You don't remember? I've never seen you before in my life. What are you doing? Amy! Are you in there? I don't know what you want... I want my wife back. Officer, I need your help. What's the problem? I think he's done something with my wife. Calm down. What's going on? I don't know. Last I saw her, she was in this guy's truck. - Now he says he never saw her. - I don't know what he means. You son-of-a-bitch! Calm down. Tell me exactly what happened. Okay. Our car broke down. He stopped and offered to help. He took my wife to a phone. She never showed up. What do you have to say? I don't know. I'm driving and he runs me off the road, hollering about his wife. I've never seen him before. - You didn't give his wife a ride? - No, sir. He's lying. May I search your truck? Hell, yes. Go ahead. My name's Red Barr. My permits are current. Take a look. Behind the line. Both of you. License and registration, please. Those yours? Yeah. My personal stuff. Want to look? No. I think we're done. You can go. Wait. You're not going to question him anymore? I've searched the truck. There's no evidence of suspicious activity. Maybe you confused my truck with another. Go to hell! Let me see that. Hold on. You want to get arrested? The man has a point. This is a plain looking truck. looks like a lot of trucks. Maybe you got them mixed up. Stay put. Mr. Taylor? It was him. It was his truck. I can see that. - Did you get a license plate number? - No. How about the information on that door? I wasn't paying attention. Mr. Taylor, did you have a beef with your wife today? What's that got to do with anything? Is there a possibility she could have left you? I don't believe this. My wife did not leave me! I've seen it before. Two people a long time, they fight. Lovers, married couples, gays guys. Dump their mates on the road. Officer. I'd like to help, but I got a long haul to Fresno. Go ahead. Thanks for cooperating. This is insane. Officer, please. I have his information if I need to find him. Much obliged. No hard feelings. I hope you find your wife. Thanks. Mr. Taylor, come with me. I believe you that your wife's missing. Maybe you got confused. I'm just trying to help. Brackett is 31 miles that way. My deputy's name is Len Carver. He'll help you if you want to report your wife missing. Mrs. Gillbert's locked out of her trailer again. Can you help her? 10-4. I'm on my way. Will do. Do yourself a favor. Go see my deputy. Recent picture? It's a couple months old. Is her hair still like this? Yeah. We'll certainly do our best, Mr. Taylor. Over 100,000 people go missing in this country every year. Runaways, deadbeat dads... dropouts, folks hiding from the I.R.S... All vanishing without a trace. We get these kinds of pictures all the time. I'm not saying your wife is one. I sure hope not. Unless there's a ransom demand or evidence of abduction, the FBI won't look at your case until it's been 24 hours. Nevertheless, we'll keep our eyes peeled. Mr. Taylor. Why don't you go to Belle's? Get a cup of coffee, wait for your wife. If anything comes up, I'll contact you. How's that sound? Yeah. Did my wife come in? Didn't see her. She didn't come in? Like I said, maybe she was in, maybe she wasn't. I'm saying I didn't see her. It ain't my business, but if I'd check the ladies room. Amy! I'll be right with you, cowboy. Let me see your order slips. What? You write down the names. Are you nuts? I don't have to show you jack-shit! If my wife was there, her name's in that pile. You calling me a liar? Let me see the fucking slips! I've had just about enough of you. Get me the Sheriff's office. My name's Billy. You looking for your wife? Yes. How do you know? Did you see her? Have you seen her? If you know something, tell me. I saw her, maybe. Where? When? Inside a little while ago. She came in a truck. - A big semi. - Then what? Then she left on another truck. With who? With some men. They think I'm a dummy, but I ain't. I'll get my trucker's license one day. It's important. Did you see where they took my wife? Route 7 North up by the river. By the river? They don't tell me that kind of thing. Who doesn't? The bartender? The men in the truck? I ain't talking to you no more. Come with me to the police and tell them what you saw. Now you're the dummy. What does that mean? Don't you get it? The police are in on it. Work, god damn it. Hello, Steve, this is Jeffrey Taylor. Please don't put me on hold. I need a favor. I have to talk to your friend at the F.B.I. Right. It's about Amy. Something happening. I think she's been... She's missing. Fuck! Steve? No, don't call me back. Don't, Steve. CAUTION. ROAD CLOSED. Get out the car now! Son-of-a-bitch! What do you want? He's getting away! What the hell's going on? He went down the river. We're pulling it out now. Careful. Don't let it come loose. I got it. This is what happens when you only get one. How will we explain this to Boyd? I ain't. You all right? According to your wife... you have a lot of cash in your bank account. True? There's some. "Some" doesn't cut it. She gave us an exact amount. I want that some figure from you. There are different accounts. The balance fluctuates. Fluctuates my ass. A hotshot fuck like you always watches his bottom line. What do you think? I think we've been lied to. He ain't a goddamn donut king. The slut lied to save her ass. Piece of shit. I'll do him. $90,000! $90,000. Crawl your ass out of there. You're a tough man to reach. What do you want? It's not what I want. It's what you want. How bad do you want it? It will cost you. I can't show it to you now. It's about 5' 5". 115 lbs., 3 or 4 of that is pure tit. Nice curly brown hair upstairs and down. Interested? Why? What does this... Why us? Bring him up here. The town of Brackett. A shit-hole in the middle of nowhere. See the bank? You're going to tell the manager to express wire... $90,000 from your bank account in Boston. Cash. How do I know she's still alive? Shut up! Come on, Jeff. Pay attention. See the building with the flag pole on top? Yeah. That's the sheriff's station. Two cops. One on desk duty, the other patrolling. A minute ago, Billy... called in an accident. See? There he goes. Take him 20 minutes to get there, 10 minutes there, 20 minutes back. 50 minutes. Exactly the time you have to get my money. Before you get any half-baked ideas about calling in the cavalry,... remember, we'll be watching you. We'll be listening on those scanners. If we see anything unusual,... an unmarked car, a plane, anyone who smells like a cop,... you can keep your fucking money. I'll send you pieces of her from time to time. Billy. Give him the jacket. Put it on, Jeff. Can't go into a bank looking like that. We don't have to do this. I'll get you the money, I swear. I promise. Just let my wife go, please. 49 minutes, Jeff. Get the show on the road. My driver's license and credit card. My bank account number. How long will this take? - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I only have $5,000 in that account. How much can you advance me? Excuse me? Can you advance me $6,000 on my credit card? No, I'm sorry, I can't. The limit for non-customers is $500 a day. Sir, are you sure you're alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Just transfer the money, okay? I'll tell you something. What I'm about to tell you, you can't call anyone. Understand? Yes. Whatever happens, just keep writing on the pad. Please, just keep writing. They're probably watching me right now. The town's under surveillance. If I don't walk out here with... Excuse me. You the manager? Yes, I am. She said to see you about a car loan. Certainly. If you would take a seat. Yes? Just forget it. I had a car accident, a minor one. I'm just kind of... How long will this take? It will take a few minutes. Shit! It's me. No shit. I can see that. How much do you have? The whole thing. $90,000. That's good. Walk toward the main road and get in the first car that stops. When do I see my wife? Soon enough. Throw the money on the seat. No. Tell me where she is. Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money. Unless you want me to shoot your ass dead right here. Turn around. Do it! Put your hands behind you. Step toward the truck. Get in the truck. On yours knees. Get in here. I gave you the money. Let her go. What the hell... It's a done deal. I'm heading in. You're the dumbest motherfucker yet. Think we picked you out at random? Shiny new car. Massachusetts plate. Be a week before anybody misses you. You should have a bumper sticker for that car. "Rich assholes looking for Trouble". I wish I'd seen your face when your car seized up. Maybe you'll learn not to leave your hood open. What the hell's that? These are goddamn singles! What are you doing? Where is she? Fuck you. No, fuck you! You like that? How about this? - Where is she? - I don't know. The fuck you don't know. Stop. What? You want me to stop? Stop? I'll bet this stops on a fucking dime! What the hell? Where is she? She's with Billy. Where? Driving around. Bullshit! In pursuit of a black Ford pickup. Contact the State Police. We're headed north on Highway 31. I need backup. - Where were you headed? - The truck stop. Where exactly? On the main highway. The Texaco. Son-of-a-bitch! Help me. My wife's been kidnapped. Drop the gun! Get down! I know where she is. Get on the ground! Do it! I'm down. Listen to me. He's in on it. They kidnapped my wife. They have her at the Texaco truck stop. Shut up! You in the pickup, you okay? Yes sir, I'm okay. Can you get out? Yes. Please don't shoot. There's a bag of money in there! Face down and shut up! Get out, damn it! God damn it, listen to me! Shut up! Shit-for-Brains. Shots fired. Officer down. Suspect identified. This is dispatch. What is your 20? Send an ambulance. Who's this Can you respond? They're coming. We'll get you an ambulance. All units. Officer down. Repeat. Officer down. He was supposed to be here a half hour ago. I heard a report about a cop down. There's too much heat around here, so stay off the airwaves. Get her and meet me at the barn. Drive all night. Daddy, you're home! - Miss me? - Yeah. Deke, get back to bed. I expected you back next week. I finished early now I'm home. Al and Billy are coming over. It's 6:00. Can't they come another time? We have stuff to do. I'll take a couple hours. Would you make breakfast? Hey, Deke! Yeah? - Will you open the barn? - Okay. Hey, Dekey. Thanks. I have something for you. Ready? Here, son. Look at that. Cool! A real Swiss Army knife. Good boy. Deke? Deke, you back there? I hope I never see another couple from Massachusetts. We have a lot of work to do. Any word on Earl? Not a thing. Me neither. We have to get this stuff off the truck. Anything that traces us back to that fuck, we get rid of. This wouldn't have happened if you'd gotten them both. He wouldn't get in the truck. I suppose you'd chase him down with a gun. Fucking idiot. I'm just saying... We should've got rid of them like the Ohio couple. So we stay out of the area for a few months. Al! Come on. Okay, honey. Time to get up. - Let's go! - Come on, move it. Get up! Dead? Must have died from the exhaust. Suicide! Couldn't be any cleaner than that. We'll bury her out back. Jesus! Goddamn! Scared me to death! Let me do her. I'll cut her head off. Warren? Shit, it's my wife. Cover her. Put her in the freezer. Be right there, Arleen. She's a feisty one, isn't she? That's right, lady. Don't give me any trouble. God damn it! Cut your fucking squirming! Come on, it's not as bad as it sounds. It will take you 10 minutes to suck all that air out. Come on, fellas. Let's go eat! Hey, Mrs. C. Are you coming to breakfast? I've been calling you. We could use some pancakes. This rooster must have weighed 10 lbs. It's reaching out to the highway patrolman. Give me the key. Mister. You son of a bitch! My wife is locked up in your fucking barn! Give me the key or I'll blow your fucking head off! What's going on? I don't know. Stay calm. Your husband's a murderer and kidnapper. Give me the fucking key! Freeze, Mister. You don't wanna do that. - Put the gun down. - Don't listen. Just keep that gun on him. My daddy's rifle is always loaded. So I can protect Mommy when he was away. I won't hurt your mom. He's lying, Deke. Go on, son. Squeeze that trigger. Don't listen to him. Go on, Deke. Don't listen to him. Do what I say. Squeeze that trigger. Put it down. Nothing will happen. Do it! Don't move. Nobody move! Get over by your mom. Get over there! Shit! Stick together and get out that door. Move it! Turn around! Turn around! Open it. Open that freezer. Warren, what is this? Pull the chain, Arleen. Open it! You'd better pray she's alive. Amy. Jeff. You made it, baby. Get away from me! Come on, honey. You son of a bitch, get down there! All of you! You remember this. You fuck! It's all right. It's okay. Listen to me, Amy. Honey, listen to me. There's one still out there. We have to get out. Shit! Can you get the truck? Okay. Come on. We must find the keys. My name is Jeffrey Taylor. This is an emergency. I need the police. Someone's trying to kill me and my wife! We're on a farm. Start tracing this call. Got them! Move! Come on. Give me the keys! Come on! Go! Do you see him? - Do you see him? - No. Are you alright? Hang on! Fuck. Shit. I'm out. Go, Jeff! - Let's go. - I can't get out! Don't move. Don't move. I'll get you out. Come here. Come on. Pull! That's it! Pull! Are you alright?
