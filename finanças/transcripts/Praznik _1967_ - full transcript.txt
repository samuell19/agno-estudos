Who was that? Manola. Is he carrying his knife? He's got a jacket on. I couldn't tell. Why today of all days? They say he goes up to Calvary every single day. God help us! It's not a good sign on a holy day! THE FEAST Where is it? Where is it? - Up by the cemetery! Which side? - Roadside! Let's go and see! Take your guns! Miloje. Sergeant Katic! They got ya, ey? Let's go! Hey. Look. Look. What is this? What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen the Allies before? What about us? Aren't we the Allies too? Tell me, mate. How's the Jerry's aim? I used to be in the anti-aircraft unit! You're lucky you survived. And that we found you. We're lucky too. Shall I chase these herds of people away? There's no room for a pin to drop here. They wanna know everything. Even military secrets. Let them watch! And if someone asks, tell them we're having American delegates over for lunch. Understood! Oh, my brothers! What misfortune brought you here? You poor bastards. Yes. I agree. This place here... Get away! What have they stopped working? Miloje? Who told you to stop? Have you found any water? Not a drop! We could dig a thousand wells and never find any water here. Didn't the captain say we should stop digging? Listen here, Nikola. You're the village elder. Go and tell Katic to let us stop working. It's not right that we should be digging on a holiday. I've told him already, but he doesn't give a damn. He's determined to reach water before the captain does. Oh, so he wants the well to look good before the captain. But I have to dig it. When is the captain coming back? Tomorrow, I hope. That's why Katic is making us dig on a holiday. What happens if we don't find water? Keep digging! If you don't find water, maybe you find gold. Leave that. Get down there. Get down there. Careful! Watch out for that nail. God almighty, in my 60 years of life I've never had more trouble on a holiday! Don't worry, uncle Pera, the way the war's going there are nicer holidays ahead. I'm sick of waiting. I'd rather die today and have you bury me in this hole. Why in this hole? You can't even stretch out properly! D'ya hear that? Oy! Why you... Bugger off! Bugger off! Bugger off, you no good bastard! Son of a bitch! In the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. Amen! Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen! In the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit Amen! Merry Christmas, brothers! Merry Christmas! There are two ways to fight a war, mates, With this... And with this... You lot fight with this... And we fight with this... We're too weak to fight the Jerrys. We leave that to you. There's a bigger dragon to eat the Jerrys than us. So why should we break our teeth? All we have to do is to keep the peace. People are much like sheep. No brains. No smarts. What would they do without us? Pray for a miracle! And once you lot kill Hitler! That's when our five minutes will come. Why just five, Katic, for God's sake? Why not longer? How about six minutes, Miloje? Or seven? I'll do with five, just as long as they come! Amen! By then, of course, we must weed out the bad crops amongst our people! That's our prerogative! That's what our war's about! And that's the hardest! There's nothing harder then weeding out the bad crops! Cheers! They don't understand a word you're saying, Katic! Of course they do. The whole world speaks Serbian! Zivota, you speak languages. Translate for them! Zivota's bit his tongue! Leave some for our guests! Have the black guy try some roast beef! I hope to God, we'll celebrate the end of the war with them and our king! We'll invite Roosevelt to our village! And we'll serve him pork! We'll invite both of those guys! The king, Roosevelt and... the other guy, we'll invite them all! You mean Churchill? Of course we'll invite him! And then the following year, we'll be invited to America! How are you gonna get to America? You've never gone farther than Pozega! That has nothing to do with it! I have an uncle in America! Does the black guy even eat pork? Maybe he's a Muslim! You idiot! He's not an Arab! He's been baptized! Katic! Should we tell the captain about the Americans? Shut up! Eat! Today, I am both your captain and your God! Can't we do something on our own for once? You're right! And when the captain does come back he'll say "well done, Katic". That's right, Kale! Eat! Eat! It's not Christmas every day! Eat! Eat! You must be starving from all that fresh air in the sky! That's right, brother! Eat! Eat! Come on! Sir! Sir! Why? What for? Quiet! You're misbehaving even on a holiday! Sir! We caught these two with their pants down. Where and when? This morning in Milenko's barn. How on Earth did you catch them? Mara told us, sergeant! Are these good people telling the truth, Sindjelija? Which good people? Which good people? You! Come here! Whose are you? - Milenko's. Well done! What a way to celebrate Christmas! Did you learn that from Milenko? For God's sake, Sindjelija! Couldn't you find some man to fuck? Did you have to sin with a child on Christmas? An honest woman wouldn't even go to bed with her husband. People! Is this a sin? Yes! Well, if it's a sin she must be put to trial! See, Sindjelija! The people want to put you to trial! You're a menace in this village! A menace! You weren't content destroying our men! Now you make us fear for our sons! Isn't that so? Yes! How to stop a menace like you! Let me think. Let's get her married! Let's get her married! Who'll be the groom? Durut! Durut! Durut! - Yes Durut! Here he is! Give him here! Let him kiss the bride! Look at your groom, Sindja! If I were a woman, I'd marry him too! Good luck tonight, Durut! Show yourself! Pinch her! Grab her by the arse, Durut! Don't worry. We'll find a best man. But first the happy couple must kiss. Go on, Durut, kiss the bride! Some bride! Doesn't wanna be kissed! She must be shy! Listen up, Sindjelija! I give you my word as a Chetnik officer that if you kiss Durut we'll forgive you your sins. I'll even let you go. But you must kiss his arse! She can kiss him wherever she wants! But we have to hear it! Come on! Get her! Hold her! Bring her back! Bring her back! If you won't kiss him then he'll kiss you! Hold her! Hold her tight! Come on Durut! Give her a kiss! Kiss her! Kiss her! She's a feisty one! Kiss her Durut! That's enough! This isn't funny. It's sad! It's sad! Sindjelija! Where's your husband? Drop dead, you scum! Have you heard me? Answer then! Where's your husband? Go home, Radojka! Go home, damn you! Your husband's in a work camp! Two years behind bars! Meanwhile... Is this the cake you made him for Christmas? You didn't ask after my husband when I made you a cake! Shut up, bitch! Or I'll stop joking! Now you call me Sindjelija but you used to call me Sindjica! Sindjica! - Cunt! Get off me! Get off! Where's the machine? Machine! Machine! Let Durut do it! That's right! Give Durut the machine! Where's the machine? Wait! Let her go! Katic, let her go! Have mercy on a holiday! Look at grandpa! Listen, grandpa! What do you want, grandpa? Bugger off, grandpa! Radojka, take the child home! Take him home! Leave my children alone, you bastards! Milenko! Go count the horses in the village! Let everyone see! You better watch out if you don't! Get me the commanding officer! Who's in charge here? I am, major! You? How come? Official duty, major! Stop fucking around! I asked who the commanding officer was! Captain Mihajlo Stojadinovic! What's that parade up on the road? White widow, major! White, but jolly! - That she is. Did you have to do that sort of thing on a holiday? She deserved to suffer like that on a holiday. And who are you? Sergeant Katic. Deputy unit commander! Well done! You've obviously promoted yourself to commander! Where's your captain? He's gone to the city for the holiday. You're a proper boss you are. Very officious! I wonder what you're like when the real boss is around. That's our problem. What do you mean our? Our. Local. No shit. Get my horse fed and looked after. Take this horse. Feed him. Rub him down! D'you have a carriage, round here? A carriage? No sir. Listen you little shit. Find me a carriage. Now! Miloje! - Yes! Go and tell Nikola we need the carriage. What do you need it for, if I may ask, sir? Why do you care? Stop asking questions and do as you're told. And when my job is done I'll give you your carriage back. Hurry up. Get your idiots to stop gawking and get my carriage! What are you waiting for?! Go. What are you gawking at? Nothing. I was just gonna say Merry Christmas. Oh yeah. Happy holiday! Long may you live! Hey! No smoking in the stable! Why? That's just the way it is. No smoking in the stable. And get away from that horse. He's restless. Which one? This one? Yeah. That one. Hawk. He kicks. Didn't I tell you? A horse is out of the stable! Who are those two guys? They're Americans. Pilots, sir. Are those the guys that crashed this morning? Yes. What are they doing here? They landed here. By the cemetery. Can anyone here lend me a carriage? Help me out. Where did this major come from? He showed up this morning from the city asking for a carriage. I'd give him mine but as you know I have no horses. Forget about the major, Nikola. He can go whence he came. Why must we work for him? Easy for you to say. I didn't serve the king nor Hitler and I won't serve this major. Forget the major. Do me a favour! Don't you have a carriage at the HQ? We don't have any because we didn't take any. We thought you'd help us if we needed it. You won't help me either, Mr Steva? Even if I wanted to I couldn't help you. My horses hate beards and uniforms. What do you want? - Katic. Listen... Get out of here. Get out! Tell them to stop interrupting, for fuck's sake. Listen, Katic. - Yes? Why don't you give me ten men so I can take those two to the city. Why should I do that? I can take them there myself. I've had enough of your silver plumage, birdie! Enough. If you wanted to be a big hero you should have taken them this morning. As soon as you caught them. Not now when the Jerrys are looking all over for them. Don't you have a bigger glass? How are you gonna get past the Jerrys? What are the Germans doing in the city? An entire unit is passing through. They're looking for them? Of course they are. They're everywhere. Like ants. They stopped me three times on my way here. You're in luck they went that way. What would you have done if they'd come here. Two Americans sitting here like guests. Still armed. The Germans are going that way then? Yes. But they'll be here by the morning. Bet on it. They haven't come here yet because they think that you'd tell them if you caught them. You're in deep shit, brother. You haven't even told your captain. Have you? No. Way to go. How are you gonna show him your face? You've got two American guests and sat down to have lunch with them. Well done! What's your rank? Sergeant. - Sergeant? No. You're a general! A general. You do as you please! You're a real general! Way to go, Katic! Cheers! Listen here. Brother. Listen to me. Only I can help you. Give me ten men and let me take those two. Huh? Stop interrupting you fucking peasants! What's up? What are you thinking about? What do you say? I say, major, we'll give you a carriage you go on your way and may God help you. What are you saying, you idiotic corporal? I'm not a corporal I'm a sergeant. And I'm not an idiot. Listen... Sergeant! You've no right to keep those men! D'you understand? I'll take your rank if not your head if you don't hand them over! You're threatening me, major? What? How dare you ask me questions? Stand still and do as you're told! Only captain Stojadinovic can give me orders! And when he's not here I give the orders! Are you going to give me orders too? Nor I you nor you me. Order your own men around! Hey! Where's my carriage? I couldn't find one, major! What did you say? No one would give me one! And you can't take one from them. They're our people! And it's a holiday. They don't wanna work today! I see. You don't wanna find me a carriage? I want to. But I can't, major! Whom are you lecturing, you fucking peasant? I'm not lecturing you, I'm telling you nicely. And please don't shout at me, major. How about now? Can you find me a carriage now? I... I told you in Serbian, major. Told me in Serbian... Then that is the last thing you'll ever say in Serbian. What are you doing? Leave me alone! Don't hit me there! I was wounded there! What are you doing? You're killing me! What are you doing? Not there! I was wounded there! I was wounded there! No! Please no! Please stop, you bastards! He's done for! What happened to Nikola? Nikola? Nikola? Nikola? Nikola? Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Nikola! Nikola! Nikola! Oh God! Nikola! Nikola! Nikola! Oh my God! God! What am I gonna do now? Fuck it! He's killed him dead! Bastard! Fucking cunt! Some officer! He's a major cunt! What is this? Let's see. Documents! See! An archive! Hey! Where are the other three? Huh? Hey! Get 'em! Quick! Shoot, for God's sake! Get the other one! Let me go! He's wounded! Can't you see he's wounded? Let me go! Where's the third one? He ran away? - Where? Up there! Follow me! What is the meaning of this? Why did you run? They went to get the Jerrys! Just you wait. They'll get you for this. Who'll get me? The Chetniks and the Germans! You can't just shoot at us! We're soldiers not rabbits! And your major? He can shoot at us? It's not our fault he killed your friend! Don't kill us! Wait! You all deserve to die! You're all the same! You officer class are worse than the Germans! You want to take our Americans away! Who wants to take them away? The officers! Let's see them try! What are you gonna do with us? Nothing. You'll sit here until we give the Americans over to the Germans ourselves. Then you can go fuck yourselves! What happened? Have you caught the third one? - He got away! Miloje's on his tail! He mustn't get away! He mustn't! Get in! Disarm them! Hand over your guns! Quiet! Tell them to take off their uniforms! Hurry up! Take it off! Get their IDs, Ugljesa! What the fuck is this? Gold chains? Write down their names and date the report! Alright. Is everything written down, Mirko? Yes. Let them keep this. We don't need that. - Take this. He's asking where he is. Can I show him? No. No. That's top secret. He's asking about the Germans. The Germans? No Germans here. This is a free country. Mirko! Write down they're asking about Germans. Alright. Mirko! Write down they're asking about the partisans. What are they asking? Who cares what they're asking just write down that they are. Something about aeroplanes! What about them? What do they want planes for? He's saying that someone's gonna come for them in a plane. They think we're the Partisans! They know we're not Communists. They want us to take them to the Partisans. They haven't a clue! They think we're the Partisans! We'll see what they know. Mirko. Give me that pen. - What are you doing? Wait and see. Wait. You'll see. Wait. Here. Wait here. Get in. You too. Come on. Keep your eyes open. Fuck your mother! Whose mother? Compared to you I'm a general! Yeah. A horse general! You fucking arsehole! Get away from me. You smell of dung. Whose mother? Yours. In my stable, I'm a general. And what are you? If it wasn't for that stable you'd be in prison now. Who's going to prison? - You are. - Fuck that. If the war hadn't broken out, you'd be in prison now. You're the biggest war profiteer there is. You should light a candle for Hitler's health! Let me tell you. Right before the war, he was arrested for black market trading. But Hitler got him out! Is this true? He's an idiot! Come on then. Deny it! You oaf! Where are you going? I'll show you who's an oaf! Hey, brother! Give us a cigarette! Cigarette! One more? Hey! Look! Look! Sharp! Sharp! Alright! Give! Danke schoen! Danke schoen! Let me see! Come on! Get away! This ain't for peasants! Don't be like that. Let me see. Come on! Come on! - Get away! Hey! Hey! Here! Here! Take this! Give! Alright! Thanks! Guten Tag! Alright! Hey! Let me see! Get away! This ain't for peasants! Give! - Get lost! Fuck your mother! You cheated them! Let's swap. Lighter for the sweater. What? Fuck! - They've run away! The pilots have run away! What? When? Ran away! Just now! Who let them run away? Get Katic! Quick! Katic! Katic! The pilots have run away! What? How? How?! Run after them! And don't come back without them! I'll kill all of you idiots! Fucking fools! Mirko! Go to Nikola's house and tell those old women to stop crying! What are you gawking at? Your slaves keep running away, general! First us! Now the Americans! We'll get 'em! Miloje's after them! Oh, sure he'll get 'em! - No doubt! He'll get 'em by the dick! He's got a chance with the white one. But he won't get the black one. You can't see him in the dark. Some army! Some Serbs you are! Keep quiet! We're lucky they're our army! Don't worry. You lot will teach us all about soldiering. You're the best army in the world! You're just bad hosts! Your guests keep running away! Well at least you're still here. We'll be going soon as well. We're just waiting for breakfast. What happened? - They're gone! Gone? Go and get Manola! What? What are you waiting for? Zivota? - Yes? Go and get the pilots' uniforms. They're coming! They're coming! Run! Run! Hey! What are you doing there? What do you want? Get away! Go! Come on! - Go away! Go away! Get lost! - Come on! Go! - Get lost! Fuck off! Vuksan? Vuksan, mate? Can you hear me? Hey, Vuksan? Mate? What have they done to you? Can you hear me? What have they done to you, Vuksan? What's this, for God's fucking sake? I said chase them away! Is this a fair? Huh? Miloje. Don't slaughter those boys for God's sake! Are you talking to me, Mr Steva? Don't kill those innocent people! Don't burden your soul with sin on a holiday! Do you know Mr Steva what an order is? I do. And I say.... I'll hide them myself if need be. And if the Germans do come they'll shoot me, not you. Captain, sir! Yesterday, we captured two American airmen! We disarmed them and locked them up! But they tried to run and we were forced to... You don't say! And where are the bodies? In the courtyard, sir! When? When? This morning, sir. Acting on orders from sergeant Katic! What orders? Who gave him those orders? Captain, sir. There's a report! Let's not talk here in front of all these people! I was authorized... By whom? Who gave you the authority to do this? He told us he had a written authorization! He's even wearing your belt! Captain, sir. There's a report. Take that belt off of him! I can take it off myself! There's a report. Have the report brought here. We deny everything in that report, sir! It's a forgery! Sreta! Yeah? Have a horse ready for the courier. He's leaving right now! Right now! - Alright! I found water! Bring Katic out! - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! I only came 'round to wish you a Merry Christmas! To celebrate it together! Dance a little! Sing a little! But look what's happened! Bring Katic out! Everything's gone to Hell! Quiet! Listen! Silence! Four men lost their lives yesterday in this village! Quiet! Quiet! It was truly a black Christmas! A bloody Christmas! But I want to wash that sin off of you and me alike! Silence! Silence! What? What? Our souls won't bear the burden of that sin! Nor could they! Because those are the crimes of a single person! One of us! Acting alone! Against our will. Stop! Stop! And he will be punished! According to law! Because he acted outside his authority! I didn't authorize him! Nor did you! Nor did God! He acted alone, he's responsible alone! And he will be punished! Quiet! Listen! Wait! I'm not finished! Listen to me, people! Keep going, priest! Take your hat off! SUBTITLES BY: Mateja Djedovic
