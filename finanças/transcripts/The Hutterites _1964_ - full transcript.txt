(bell ringing) (praying in foreign language) - [Narrator] 1,265 Hutterites emigrated from Russia to Dakota territory in the 1870s. Their three and a half centuries-old society had always forbidden holding private property on the basis of Christian teaching. A century after this migration, this group had grown to some 30,000 souls, farming well over a million acres of land and with colonies in a dozen states or Canadian provinces. Scattered from South Dakota to British Columbia, the Hutterites prefer sparsely settled countryside, where it's too far for the children to walk to town. - We're in the world but not of the world. We're isolated from all worldly pleasures and lusts, and so forth on. Community life is a hard life if you don't do it for Christ's sake. - [Man] The name arise from Hutter, Jacob Hutter. He was a hat-maker. (singing in foreign language) - [Narrator] The Hutterite community is first and foremost a Christian fellowship. It was born in the Protestant Reformation of the 1520s out of the Swiss German Anabaptist movement. Spiritual cousins of the more numerous Mennonites and Amish, the Hutterites came to America with thousands of Mennonites when the Russian Tzar withdrew a promise by Catherine the Great that Mennonites could be exempted for reasons of conscience from military service. The handwritten Hutterite Chronicle begins with the bloody saga of persecution by Catholic authorities in Europe. Nicknamed the big history book, it is still kept up in South Dakota. It recalls the first baptism in Switzerland in 1525 and the decision a few years later to establish a community of goods according to the Biblical pattern as recorded in the second chapter of Acts. This occurred in Moravia. A period of toleration before 1620 allowed the Hutterites to prosper and to refine the art of ceramics, but their colonies were depicted by critics as strange and dangerous nests of birds. When Jesuits confiscated their property and children, they fled to what are today Hungary and Romania. - [Gary] The Hoffers, the Waldners, the Glansers, the Worts family that's from-- - [Narrator] Gary Waldner, a Mennonite native of South Dakota, is of Hutterite ancestry. - Well, in Clanchester, these are families that we know the exact farms where they came from in Austria, because that's all on record. They were Lutherans and they came as Lutherans to Transylvania, where they came up to (mumbles) Hutterites, there, became convinced that the Hutterites have the right teaching, and joined them eventually, too. - [Narrator] In the 18th century, they fled again to the Ukraine. Here, their minister, Michael Waldner, led them in 1864 to recover the communal organization they had lost in their pilgrimage. In 1874, Waldner led a group of his people to purchase a fur trading post on the Dakota banks of the Missouri River. Only about a third of his 1,265 immigrants chose to keep the communal life. But from those 400 have come today's 30,000 souls in 300 colonies. About a third live south of the Canadian border. Two graves in South Dakota record the death of a pair of Hutterite conscientious objectors in World War I, after abused by soldiers at Fort Leavenworth. Such treatment frightened all but one of the 17 colonies into resettling in Canada. But during the 1930s, South Dakota invited them back to the farming land de-populated by the Great Depression. - [Gary] The Schmiedeleut, or the Schmied (mumbles), as we also call them, come from Michael Waldner who was a blacksmith or schmied. And then, of course, the other ones they're called Dariusleut. The Dariusleut were organized in Russia already and came over as a group and settled in Wolf Creek. And then, of course, Lehrerleut comes from the teacher, Lehrer, who had studied among the Mennonites in Russia. - The conservatives are the Lehrerleut. The moderate (mumbles) would be the Dariusleut, and the most liberal are the Schmiedeleut. (singing) - [Narrator] Although they will never fight nor take an oath, Hutterites are far from being anarchists. - [Man] I respect that very much, that the government is ordained from God. We feel that God is a God of order. - [Narrator] They consider themselves loyal subjects of the tolerant English-speaking governments under which, after three and a half centuries, they found refuge. But they would be ready to move again, if North American society should forbid them an alternative to military service, or the privilege of having their own school. (singing in foreign language) (chanting in foreign language) Each colony has its own school to teach by route eternal values and the German language of the Hutterite origins. The so-called German school convenes mornings and afternoons for an hour before and an hour after the English or public school, which meets in the same room. (speaking in foreign language) While the sacred duty's being taught, the symbol of worldly authority is covered. (speaking in foreign language) (slapping) - It depends a great lot on a German teacher in the colony. I mean, that's where you start teaching the children standards and morals. - [Narrator] The German teacher supervises the children's manners and spiritual understanding. He also has a Sunday afternoon school at which he tests the children's memory of the morning ceremony. In their own way, Hutterites successfully educate their children for community and eternity. Few of these children would ever be able to feel comfortable living as non-Hutterite individuals, or even as members of a Christian nuclear family. They are deeply taught that they are not here to enjoy themselves, but to serve the community in preparation for eternity. This collective outlook is the only understanding of life that makes sense to them. The child wakes in a community of generations. And he's weaned at the age of two and a half from the immediate family. Hutterites invented the kindergarten in their thriving colonies in Moravia over 400 years ago. (chattering) Even with large families, mothers are not overburdened with child care. The most liberal of the three main branches of the Hutterites, provides playgrounds with its kindergartens. A grandmotherly woman or (foreign word), assisted by teenage girls, is in charge. The kindergarten child has few social rights, and is considered unruly or foolish, but not evil. A small child receives love and kisses from all sides. In addition to his specific parents, everybody else looks out for him. The bond is especially strong with grandparents. - You're okay. Okay, jump. (thuds) (laughing) We feel that the wisdom of God is the best education that first (mumbles). We want our children to be educated, but not educated in a consolidated school. (bell ringing) - [Narrator] And the English, a public school, the state brings its secular authority onto the colony compound. The relation is congenial. The English teacher is usually a non-Hutterite employed by the state or province, teaching the state-oriented curriculum. The colony willingly pays proportionate school taxes while insisting that the children study on the compound itself. The unique fusion of the Hutterite colony school in both the United States and Canada is the fruit of a successful dialogue with the state. - [Man] While we went to school, we couldn't talk English was well as they can now. They pick it up sure fast with the English teacher. - [Interviewer] Do you think that threatens the Hutterite way of life to do that? - I don't think so. This is an English country and it has changed, huh? They do that every year. They're (mumbles) at Medicare. I think they're different nurses every year. But they're acquainted with them in a couple hours. (laughing) (laughing) - [Woman] Gum? - [Narrator] The child may be exposed to some national or secular influence, as long as the spiritual community has the last word. - Put on your coats. Fasten it up. Get your gun. Let's go! (tapping) Hmm, I see a wheat field. Can't go over. Can't go under. Let's go through. Two big lights. The big teeth. And a cool wet nose. See the bear run! (tapping) From the ocean, up the trees, back down. To the wheat field. (giggling) - Okay, enough for you. Come on, bed time. - [Narrator] Each individual family has its own apartment, with only a limited kitchen, or none at all. (praying, indistinct) Hutterite ideas had been put into classical form by the 17th century. - Well, our sermons are always ready. We can't thank God enough that they're already in prepare. We call it ready-cut bread, spiritual bread. It's Acts the Second. - You usually have your sermons in order, like, I mean, for these certain holidays year-round, you got sermons every holiday. I'd written some sermons six times. There are things at service, a thick book of, what is it, 370 pages. I've copied these books seven times. It's all over the colonies from Manitoba to Montana. - [Narrator] The minister, chosen by the casting of lots, is the head of each colony. - [Minister Voiceover] It's a high calling, very important calling, very big responsibility, because everything I've seen it, not quite in line, it bothers you right away. It doesn't bother the average man so much, but it does you, because you have a duty to do it and you tell them that it's not right. Well, I try them, not in a commanding way, always in an appealing way, softly, it works better. - [Narrator] The head minister and a younger assistant lead the colony to focus in worship every day of the week. For this observance, no bell rings. That one had the right remark, would be too much like the Catholics. Every one in the colony seems immediately aware when the minister has left his house for the worship service. And all follow, dressed in dark clothes, within a few minutes. The building in which the service is held is not sacerdotal. It is the place for the meeting, located in the center of the colony, near the dining room. Sometimes the schoolhouse may be used, with school equipment placed in closets and flags removed or covered. (singing) The sermon is read from one of the minister's large collection of handwritten or photocopied manuscripts. (singing) (speaking in foreign language) My dear brothers and sisters of our gathering, may it be acknowledged, known, and recognized that all that is done here is only for the glory of God. Every day, every moment, we are to consider whether our offering is pleasing to God, or whether it is not pleasing to Him. Christ said, "A new commandment I give to you, "that you love one another "as I have loved you. "Thereby, everyone shall know "that you are my disciples "if you have love among yourselves." - When you are willing to totally surrender your life, you forsake it all, then it's no more yours. You have to do God's will. Whatever it is, you can't serve God and man, you can't serve them both. You definitely have to have a total surrender. - [Narrator] Although raised within a severely strict system, Hutterite children enjoy the companionship of a large extended family of playmates. Their sense of personal worth comes less from the freedom to play, which they do have, than from becoming involved in colony work. (uplifting harmonica music) - [Boy] Ho! - [Man] Oh, they can mess things. You missed the gate. - Ho, ho. - [Narrator] As they learn to work, the children are learning the fundamental lesson of giving themselves to the community. Their efforts are supposed to be seen, not as expressions of personal achievement, but as participation in the common welfare. Over and over, they are taught (foreign word), mutual resignation, as the cardinal Christian virtue. If they ever leave the colony, one of their most shocking experiences will be to accept a paycheck for what they do. The boy, more than the girl, feels honored to be given special responsibility as this signals his approach toward manhood in a patriarchal society. Young Eli of Saskatchewan is allowed to come to school late so that he may take the dairy herd out to graze. The beekeeper is often one of the two ministers. (man mumbling instructions) - [Eli] Seal them up? - [Man] It'll seal 'em. - [Narrator] Just growing up in the colony, several of the boys are likely to learn a great deal about beekeeping, informally. (bees buzzing) - [Man] Don't smoke 'em too hard. - [Narrator] So that when a new beekeeper is needed, someone already has a feel for the job. - See that, the father bee is here? (mumbles) how big it is? See all of these spots in here, okay? That's sort of queen, lay it eggs. Over here, you can see how big they grew already. See how big they grew? Over in here, they seal them up already. - They look like little worms. - [Man] They're just little worms. Let me open up one here to show you, see? See how big that is already? - [Narrator] At this colony in Saskatchewan, which belongs to the conservative Lehrerleut wing of Hutterites, the boys get hats instead of caps at the age of 15, showing their approach to adulthood. - What's the word for mother? - Mudeh. - How about father? - Fudeh. - How about brother? - Brudeh. - Sister? - Suesteh. - Uncle? - Ungkle. - [Interviewer] But when you talk to an old man, what do you call him? - Fedeh. Fedeh. (mumbling) - [Narrator] The boys' visored caps made by their mothers are a mark of their ancestors' sojourn in Russia, for the century prior to the migration to America. A school girl spends much of her time as a babysitter. At 15, she, too, will be allowed a more adult type of work. A Hutterite girl isn't used to answering questions about her personal opinion. - [Interviewer] What is the thing you don't like to do the most? - Babysitting. - [Interviewer] But you're willing to do it, aren't you? - Well, you have to. - [Interviewer] Do the children behave for you? - No. Can you expect? - [Interviewer] So what would happen to you if you didn't behave? - We'll get a strapping. - [Interviewer] Did you ever get one? - Sure. - [Interviewer] Is it hard? - Well, all depends on teacher, if you have a strict one or... - [Interviewer] Who straps harder, the German teacher or the English teacher? - The German teacher. - [Interviewer] Do you behave better for the German teacher? - Yes, and for the English teacher, too. Have to respect 'cause they're ordering you. - [Interviewer] What if that doesn't do any good even if they strap them? Then what happens? - Well, you strap harder, and they don't obey, that strap mean harder. - [Interviewer] Did you ever get a hard strapping? - No, never. - [Man] The girls last week went out driving (mumbles). They didn't say anything to me. - [Man] You mean, there are (mumbles) here? - [Man] Are you sick? - [Man] Oh, I haven't seen any yet. - [Man] Oh, you just don't know where to go. (chattering) - [Interviewer] Are you anxious to be 15? - Yes. (upbeat harmonica music) - [Narrator] Old-fashioned songs like The Wreck of the Old 97 aren't forgotten by Hutterite young people. No one girl has to work overly hard, and one can socialize in the midst of work. With a crew like this one in South Dakota, a large vegetable garden can be made free of weeds in half an hour. (chattering) A girl, too, absorbs skills simply by participating in group work. She can bake a cherry pie without anyone teaching her. But she's more likely to bake 15 with her sisters and cousins preparing for a weekend meal. (chattering) A woman's work is sharply bounded by sexually-defined roles. Girls can look forward to a life of physical work shared by the community, and early retirement from strenuous labor. The only administrative roles open to women in the colony are those of chief cook and head seamstress, whereas there may be six or seven departments for men to be buzzed over. ♪ He knows I've got leaving on my mind these days ♪ ♪ When I get this urge to roam ♪ ♪ I'm just like a kid again ♪ ♪ Same old jail breaker running away ♪ ♪ Here I go once again ♪ ♪ With my suitcase in my hand ♪ ♪ And I'm running away down River Road ♪ ♪ And I swear once again that I'm never coming home ♪ ♪ I'm chasing my dreams down River Road ♪ (bell ringing) The man in charge of meat-cutting can always count on a labor pool to whom no wages are due. Feeding a hundred or more people daily calls for expert management. Much of the food is raised and processed on the colony farm, and the rest is bought in bulk after skillful buying at favorable prices. - [Man] (mumbles) in chicken barn and take first responsibility there. And that's all it takes. Nobody is forced, nobody is driven to work harder than his capability allows him. (singing) - [Narrator] Freda of North Dakota is preparing for church membership as she works. She keeps her catechism close by. - (mumbles) that each young person gets when he's about ready to get baptized. There's 45 questions and answers, and we have to learn those by heart, and also two poems, and we can choose either one, which one we wanna learn, which we have to recite before the community. - [Interviewer] When do you recite that to them? - The Saturday before we get baptized, so the day before. - [Interviewer] How would you say you would have to change? - You'd be more devoted to the community and to the Lord, and also with my fellowmen. I have to accept when somebody admonishes me in some areas and I have to also admonish others when I see wrong. - [Interviewer] Do you think you can do that? - Maybe (laughs), with the Lord's help. - [Interviewer] Is it a struggle for you to come to that choice to give yourself up? - Yes, it is. - [Narrator] (mumbles) of North Dakota met her future husband at a young people's concert among the liberal Schmiedeleut colonies of Manitoba. (singing) Hutterites are a serious people, modest and restrained. No projection of the individual personality is favored.

Traditionally, playing harmonicas has been tolerated but not publicly. (mellow harmonica music) A Hutterite is one of the most candid persons you will ever meet. The man on the left, from a colony half a continent away, is here in South Dakota looking for a wife and everybody knows it. - [Interviewer] Should a woman obey her husband? - Yes. - [Interviewer] On what do you base that? - On the Word. - [Narrator] Young Tom Waldner of Manitoba got his wife from a colony 120 miles away. The couple's first home together is an apartment in the kindergarten building, chosen for them by colony elders. They have no economic anxiety, no rent or mortgage to pay. - [Interviewer] Where do you think they'll put you after this? - You'll never build a house someday. - You're not worried? - Mm-um. - You're not either? - No. - [Narrator] Young Tom tried life alone in Winnipeg before returning to the colony and marrying. (clanking) Now he says he wouldn't want his son to leave the colony because, as he puts it, "There's nothing out there." A machine shop is central to the business of the colony. Hutterites service and even invent and build much of their own equipment. - We used to have one of (mumbles) rust, you know? There's so much hazard in the maneuver from the hog barn. They're rust, now we're gonna make it out of same machine. We hope it's gonna last forever. (whirring) - [Interviewer] What do you feel deep down (mumbles)? And yet the colony makes you buzz in it. - [Man] Then you just have to be a blacksmith and enjoy it. - [Interviewer] How did you get picked to work in the shop? - Oh, I guess they voted me in here. - [Interviewer] Do you like it? - I enjoy it. - [Interviewer] Don't you ever wish you were doing something else? (mumbles) - (mumbling) for a while and I didn't like that so I did it. (whirring) - [Narrator] One colony in South Dakota has a mill that has grown into a commercial business, with its own brand of feeds, successfully competing with larger firms. - [Man] The business there were modern. We are thinking about putting in a computer. - [Minister] But we do not try to modernize our religion or the hope that is given us for a narrow path. That, we do not try to modernize. - [Narrator] A family apartment, particularly with the strictest Hutterites, is as bare as an architect's drawing. The point of life is not to be lost amidst the decor. But the feeling of austerity is softened by continuous socializing among Hutterite friends and relatives from near and far. (chattering) Even an evening snack is always preceded by a memorized prayer, with folded hands. (praying in foreign language) The husband, in this case the colony boss, is clearly the authority in the family. (chattering) - We went there, always far from home, and (mumbles) over our drive (mumbles). - So we didn't go to sleep on the road. - [Narrator] Next to the minister, the steward or colony boss, called Wiet in German, has the most authority. Elected on the basis of what is considered his superior ability, he oversees the buying and selling and is really the head of a good-sized, legally-structured farm cooperative, dealing in hundreds of thousands of dollars. He is the head of the various department bosses in the colony, in charge of cows, hogs, chickens, shop, or field. - That guy is the boss. He is the boss out in the field, tells everybody what to do and what he wants done. - [Interviewer] How do you like taking orders? - Don't bother me. You gotta obey anyhow if you like it or not. - In seeding time, they work right up to 11 and 11:30. If the field is ready to get done, or close by, they're gonna work till one or two in the morning. Every once in a while, they come in at two. - [Man] Sometimes I put in 18 hours a day. When we're out seeding and we wanna get done, just let it roll 'cause that's my piece of land just like it's anybody else's so I feel I gotta work. Well, everybody feel what's their piece of whatever is around the year and they own it as much of anybody else does. We are already in the church, everybody that lives in the colony is in church automatically. - But you're not baptized? - No. Maybe next year or the other or the other. - [Interviewer] You're gonna be a Hutterite all your life? - [Man] If nothing happens, bad, yeah, I can leave it if I want, but I don't want. I feel I got it better in here than any place else. In here, I don't have to worry about nothing. Just live. When I would be up there in (mumbles), you're trying to make a living, if things go wrong, you don't work, you ain't got no money. You know how it goes. - [Man] We use the most modern equipment that's on the market today. We feel it's only equipment and has nothing to do with religion of any kind. - [Narrator] Building their own barns and installing the latest equipment by themselves, Hutterites make vigorous competitors in the agricultural marketplace. This herd of (mumbles) at a colony west of Winnipeg was ranked as the highest in milk production per cow in the province of Manitoba. A hundred miles south, another colony had a herd of brown Swiss that was ranked second in production of all breeds in the state of North Dakota. - [Man] I have to keep up with the Joneses here. I feel he has the edge over us right now. Our neighbor here. I farm 70 acres per capita. What does he farm, 600. - [Narrator] Unlike the better-known Amish, Hutterites don't hesitate to reap the benefit of technological advance, and they use big equipment. If it isn't big enough, they make it themselves. (whirring) - [Man] Most of our boys have, you might say, been working big money on the oil rigs but they all come back. Most of them, I would say, 80%, 85% of them come back. So it must be security and this is what men live for, it seems like, I mean, the human nature, wants security. - [Man] You have clubs, (mumbles) What are they for? Having people want to live together. They don't want to live as an individual. - [Interviewer] What do you do for recreation? - [Man] Recreation, work harder. Sometimes, Sunday afternoon, we'd go out and play baseball and stuff like that. - We don't encourage all kinds of recreation. The colony doesn't object to it so much as when they start yelling around a bit too loud, we don't like this at all. It reminds us of the outside world so much. If they can do it in a more reserved way and enjoy playing, it's more acceptable, because Christ was quiet all the time. We wanna be a true follower of Christ. You are following His footsteps. He was quiet, reserved, this is what we like to have. (kids squealing) (yelling) (chattering) (cheering) We don't like the sick kid coming too close to cities. If we can keep them right out in the countryside like we do it, we don't encourage town visits too much. It's more than there used to be because all your produce has to be hauled to towns and cities, but it's always better if they stay away from there. In the countryside, it's next to (mumbles), not too tempting, you know. I know in my days, I never seen so many shows but when the minister, when they found out, that you had to stand in church (mumbles). - I am tempted but I don't yield. - Well, we have no objection to taking a drink. We approve it if you take it in moderation because I think we have a Biblical basis for this, too, because Paul said, he commanded Timothy, he could drink for thy stomach's sake. He never encouraged to overdrink because the Bible speaks against drunkards and there's ruin (mumbles). - [Interviewer] What do you do when somebody overdoes? How can you deal with it? - Well, they usually have to stand up in church and be corrected, or later they're brought up in what we call a (foreign word) just to have a court session like the elders will talk over it. They correct him up there. You have to either stand up and apologize for it. We don't approve of it. - [Man] Or we are clannish, too, just like the Indian. But the Indian is very clannish. He could never do without, he's got to be amongst his own and the Hutterite is much the same. And you don't find no place better than right here. When you have to live with your fellowmen, you know what that's like. You live with me and I live with him. The ordinary individual can go around the block and circumvent his neighbor, but not here. You can't do it. You have to live with them. And I tell you, it's the supreme test. - [Man] It is only possible through the Bible, through Christian bringing up. So I put that in under myself. Blessed are those who create peace around them. And I'll tell you, there's more than one way you can create peace around you. - [Narrator] When the Red River overflowed and endangered the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota, Hutterites from a small colony 40 miles away joined the volunteers working night and day to contain the river. (radio chattering) As far as basic physical, non-political needs are concerned, the separatist Hutterites feel complete solidarity with their uncovenanted neighbors. In such an emergency, they don't mind working with the Red Cross, or even the military, though they themselves are conscientious objectors to military service. (chattering) - Yeah, we're sandbagging couple of days ago, sandbagged for eight hours. - Are you tired? - Oh, yeah. - [Interviewer] How many came from the colony? - I think there was 20 or something. - Can I get through all the way up, or not? - As far as this forklift is up there, as far as you can get. - Okay, and there's nobody up there. - Right. - Okay, try to go around then. - [Narrator] The Hutterite colony brought their heavy equipment and kept it going until the emergency was over. (plaintive harmonica music) (upbeat harmonica music) - [Boy] Don't have my tools. This fish bite my hook. They're doing right at me. They ought to. (upbeat harmonica music) (mechanical whirring) - [Narrator] The medieval European village was a largely self-sufficient unit, performing its own crafts. Hutterites retained some aspects of that village self-sufficiency. - I didn't used to like it but now I do. I've been at it for 16 years now, you know. I (mumbles) every year. I wanna take some more time, I was making a pair of shoes. Now you multiply that by 150, besides feeding ducks and geese and repair work. It's a lot easier repairing than it is to fix a button shoe because of them button shoes are already glued together or cemented together, you know. And that's hard to fix. Sometimes you get a shoe, and I got a good example hanging over there on the wall. Well, the one fell apart whereas the other one was just a good shoe, but you are not gonna walk one-legged. - [Narrator] The shoemaker in this colony in Saskatchewan is also responsible for the ducks and geese. While most of the other men are 60 miles away building a new colony, the shoemaker oversees the annual duck killing. Helping him are the girls and women, several of the older men, and some of the older children excused from school for the day. (quacking) Since this seasonal activity is exactly the same from year-to-year, it has a predictable ritual flavor. Every person seems to know his or her own role, with the children considering it a privilege to be included in the adult project. (whirring) (quacking) (quacking) (chopping) (quacking) ♪ Lord, help me today, show me the way ♪ ♪ One day at a time ♪ ♪ Do you remember when you walked among men ♪ ♪ Well, Jesus, you know if you're looking below ♪ ♪ It's worse now than then ♪ ♪ Show me the stairway I have to climb ♪ ♪ Lord, for my sake, teach me to take ♪ ♪ One day at a time ♪ ♪ One day at a time, sweet Jesus ♪ ♪ It's all I'm asking from You ♪ ♪ Just give me the strength ♪ ♪ To do everyday what I have to do ♪ ♪ Yesterday's gone, sweet Jesus ♪ ♪ And tomorrow may never be mine ♪ ♪ Lord, help me today, show me the way ♪ ♪ One day at a time ♪ (chattering) Dipping the duck in hot wax and then in cold water leaves a coating of wax that takes the little thin feathers with it when it's peeled off like a crust. There isn't great physical stress on older people in the colony. After the age of 45 or 50, they find the hard labor carried by the younger people, who greatly outnumber them. The older folks can do as much work as they feel able to do. And they never have to worry about writing a will or bequeathing their property to the next generation. All they have, except for a few personal mementos already belongs to their children. (quacking) Broom-making is another of the village crafts that has survived here and there in Hutterite colonies. It allows an old man some meaningful activity, as this particular man in South Dakota just a few months before his death in his 80s. Skills learned in his youth remain in his hands even after his physical responses have slowed down. A handmade Hutterite broom will last until its very fiber deteriorates. At all ages, Hutterites know why they are alive, and how they should live. By old age, they are surrounded by a large family of offspring who treat them with respect. - [Peter Voiceover] In winter months especially, I wrote quite a few of those old books that they had printed for (mumbles) in Austria. - [Interviewer] How old were you when you did that? - [Peter] 75, 77. I would do it today if I had something interest. I first read (mumbles) writings. And it's easier to write. - [Narrator] Peter Ans found the manuscripts he had written himself. He finds the work enjoyable, in a retirement that comes after 33 years of being colony boss. The small size of many Hutterite cemeteries emphasizes the fact that the majority of the colonies are relatively young. Paradoxically, though they always stress community, the Hutterites remember each individual vividly. When the population of a colony increases beyond a certain level, there goes a consciousness of a need to swarm, to found a daughter colony. It's called branching out. - [Man] Hey! Go away, (mumbling). - [Narrator] No one worries about this. The pattern is fixed in communal memory. Hutterites have had to move and rebuild for four and a half centuries. - [Man] Come (mumbles) at the hill! - [Narrator] At this, they are professionals. - [Man] The hair. - [Narrator] Half the goods are transferred to the new colony. Everybody packs to move, and the group is divided between the two ministers. - [Man] (mumbles) Favor the hill. - [Narrator] Lots are then drawn to see which of the two sets will move. - [Man] Okay, do it. - [Narrator] The new village is laid out on the prairie, consciously to the directions of the compass. It isn't left or right, but east or west, south or north. - No, not (mumbles), I'll do it. (whirring) - [Man] When this colony gets organized to set up, we want them to be complete, wanna make it appealing, so there won't be any hardships moving. - [Interviewer] You want to drain water away from the neighbors, that's right, will you? - No, we got the rights there. You talk with government official. They gave you the okay on it. We're doing everything within our rights and to see how it works good. - [Narrator] The Hutterian brotherhood has been called the fastest growing society known in North America. There's strong motivation, hard work and cohesiveness, give them economic advantages that are sometimes resented. This was especially true in Alberta in the 1960s and 70s. - We have been criticized for not patronizing the local merchants in all this, but when you just drive into the big cities and you see where the neighbors are doing all the shopping, but Hutterites have to be the scapegoats in a lot of this thing and just criticizing for it. Christ promises, in the Bible. If you wanna be a follower of Christ, you can except this. I think you should get a write down and study it deeply. You can see it's just motivated by enviness, and jealousy, and prejudice. They think they can compete with us. They look at this big place of colony being built and they think the Hutterites get all kinds of money and they don't realize that you've earned the money like anybody else, but with our system, I think, is ahead of the individual system because we don't have to pay labor cost in a community life where you're sharing. And you'd have to pay salaries or labor, this kind, you couldn't afford to develop a place like this. I think it's a high calling to be a Hutterite. And a lot of thing, the good Lord meant it for everybody in the world to be a Hutterite, I don't think so. - [Interviewer] So you think maybe some other people will get to heaven that weren't Hutterites? - Well, that Bible word when Jesus talks there, they did come from all corners of the earth, I believe that's very important, that's very significant. - [Narrator] A small group of people in Japan have not only adopted Hutterian beliefs and translated the old writings, but accepted communal living and even Hutterite custom. They are part of a greater Hutterian society which, in recent decades, has been joined by several Christian communities originating in Europe, and now thriving in the eastern United States and England. (chattering) - [Interviewer] You have your pick when this is done. Would you want to stay at the old colony or this one? - It doesn't matter. - Really? - You don't care where we'll end up. - [Interviewer] How about the other girls? - [All] We don't care. (chattering) - [Narrator] "Teach us to care and not to care", wrote T.S. Eliot. To be a Hutterite is not to care about yourself, but to care about the (mumbles), community, God's approval. It is to trust God to reward you manifoldly in eternity for what you gave up in time, for the sake of the kingdom. (singing) No one who trusts in God will be put to shame. Were I to be the first one? No, that's impossible, not to a shepherd.
