- Bobby? - Veronica! - Bobby? - Veronica? - Bob... - Oh, my God, you're okay. Let me look at you, let me look at you. - I have to go. - Let's get the fuck outta here, come on. - Oh, my God, they're coming, Bobby. Go, they're coming, go. Bobby, start the car, they're coming. Bobby. Those are the guys, Bobby, go! You piece of shit. - Come on. - Gentlemen. We gather here today as our brothers did in 1701 to put an end to evil. - God, please help me. - Hey, you're one of us now. - Bobby, no, Bobby, no. Oh, God, please. God, please help me! - This God, doesn't exist. - Hear our plea. For the demons that dwell within this tainted woman be burned from her flesh. - For the sake of the brotherhood. - Oh, Bobby, Bobby, no. Bobby, please, please, Bobby. No, please, Bobby, no. - That was a scene from the unfinished 1987 film "The Devil's Fire" directed by Norman Von Ness. Now, please welcome to the stage, his son, Mr. Peter Von Ness. - Thanks, Kyle. Hi, everyone. Hi, and welcome to the Norman Von Ness Film Festival. As you already know, my name is Peter Von Ness. I am the son of Norman Von Ness, and I'm also the person who started this festival. And as you all know, the reason I decided to have this festival here is because it is the site of his unfinished and last film, "The Devil's Fire", which you just saw a clip from, but it's also as many of you do know as well is the site of his untimely passing. As well as the cast and crew of the film, which included the actress, Carly Skye, who you saw on the screen. But it is a real pleasure to have all your talented people here. I know you've all been working really hard, countless hours in the upcoming weeks working on scripts, working on lines, trying to get these short films all ready for this time. My dad would've been really proud to know, all we know this, just wanted you guys to know that you also would've noticed there is a $25,000 prize. So you guys are working for something right? With this festival, we here are trying to have Norman Von Ness pass the torch to the younger generation of actors, directors, writers, and creative support. Oh! That was weird. What was I gonna say? Um... Kyle, do you wanna take this over? Yeah, great, okay, great. - You okay? - Yeah, man, I'm fine. - Sorry about that. Vincent is definitely gonna check that out. But first of all, congratulations on making the cut. The competition was stiff, but Peter hand-selected all of you because of your true passion and commitment. You will be provided with everything you need until the bus picks us up in three weeks. Each team will be able to cast any of the actors we've invited. In order to qualify for the prize, you need to hand in your finished film, 48 hours before our closing ceremony, where we will be screening the winning film. - Yeah, yeah, oh. On that note, I want everyone to come meet us at the bar, mingle a little bit, get to know everybody you'll be working with the next few weeks. Don't be a part of your own horror story. Great, okay, I'll see everyone there. Bye. - Peter, everyone, Peter. - It's a great reception, Peter. Open bars a nice touch too. - Yeah, yeah, I hope everyone enjoyed it. - Is this your first Sundance? - Yeah, I guess. - Yeah. - Oh, Anne! Oh, hey, hey, Anne, how are ya? - Hey, Peter. - Hey, how you doing? - I'm good, how are you? - Good. Good, hi. This is Chad. He just went to Sundance and I thought you guys should meet. This is Anne. She's a filmmaker too. Yeah, you guys should sit down and talk. - Hey, Anne. - Thanks, Peter. - Thanks, Peter. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. - I love doing slashers, but I feel like I'm always cast as the final girl. - I'm sorry, what, the what? - The final girl, the last girl standing barely alive covered in blood. It's so annoying. - Didn't know there was this type. - Yeah, it's really frustrating. Are you frustrated getting cast by type? - Honestly, I haven't really booked any like this year. So, that sounds like a nice problem to have. - Well, to the future, man. - To the future. - Should we see our friends? - Anyone actually know where the fuck we are? - Yeah, we're on a bus ride to nowhere. - Hey Ryan, does anyone know the history of this place? - You mean all the people that were killed here in the 1700s? Yeah, I've done my research. - Maybe they deserve it. - Guys, women accused of being witches were burned here. - Yeah, I know. - Of course you do. - Hi, can I have a Jack and Coke, please? - Peter. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Good, good. How you been? - Good. - That's great. - So you really knew Carly Skye? - I'm a little bit. She used to babysit me when I was a kid, a little bit so I don't really remember her too much. But I remember her like around the house. But yeah. - What was she like? - A little bit like you, I guess. - Excuse me guys. Sorry. I, is it okay if I snap a picture really quick? - Yeah, of course. Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey, Simon. Good. Awesome. I should head out, 'cause I gotta keep talking to people, but it was nice seeing you. - Yeah. - Let's talk later, okay? - Yeah, definitely. - Great. - Are you filming me? - Yeah, sorry. Sorry. - For what? Are you documenting the festival? - Oh, no, no, no, no. This is just, it's... It's like, I just like to sort of always be recording. You know, like you never know what you're gonna get. - So you're into verite? - Oh my God, yes, I love that stuff. But this isn't that this is more like... It's like, it's like they say between projects. You never see Jarmish without a camera, you know. - Or a guitar. - Yeah. Yeah, you're into Jim Jarmish? - Jim Jarmish. - Oh my God, he's like my idol. I'm Simon, by the way. - Rosemary. - Rosemary. So, are you a filmmaker or... - I'm an actress. - Simon, Simon, Simon. Still trying to move the ladies with your knowledge of independent filmmakers, huh? - Oh, such a cutey, isn't he? - Oh, stop. - Oh, you embarrassed? - So as I initiate this script that I wrote... And I interrupting something a little, bro? - No, we were just talking. - Hi, I'm Trevor. - Rosemary. - And I'm Felix. - Hey. - Let's have some shots. - Shots. Shots. - Not for me, but, I'll see you guys later. - All right. Make mine a double. Let's do this, boys. - Um, so... - No, it's fine. - So you native American? - Yeah, my mom is. - No kidding, that's perfect. Because that was usually passed down through the mother line, which is like, I mean this is so crazy that that's the case. And once you see these costumes, they're like so beautiful. - I cannot wait to see them. - Do you like whisky? - I do. - Cool, I'll be right back. Excuse me. Hey, can I get two shots of whiskey, please? Thanks so much. Can you put it on my tab? - Hey. Kelly Klein, right? - Hi. Yeah. I'm Anne Laberado. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you as well. I'm a director. - Okay. - And I was thinking that you would be perfect for the lead girl in my movie. - That's awesome, yeah. What's it about? - Okay, so it's an action horror film with strong female characters, a group of modern day witches. - Yeah, that's, that, that's sounds awesome, yeah. - Why don't you get your own mews? - Hi, Chad, nice to see you too. - Nice to see you too. - So you're looking for an actress, right? - Yeah, you wanna be in my film? - Yeah, sure. - Well, cheers to that. - Cheers. - Well, see you later, Anne. - Oh, yes you will. - You know, you can just send me the script. - Sure. - Yeah. - I'll do that. - So let's talk about my character, Grace. - Right, all right, so forget all this native American stuff, right? The thing about Grace is she's more free than the rest and that's what makes her dangerous, right? They're all afraid of her independence. You know, she's more in touch with herself, her surroundings and the women all hate her for it, right. But the men you see, they all love her and they're willing to do whatever it takes to have her. I think, you know what the most important part of Grace is? - What's that? - She's you. - She's me? Nice. - She's you. - I'm gonna go. It's late, I gotta go to bed, be up early. - So... - It's cool. - No. - Yes. - Goodnight, Chad. - Goodnight. Hey, I see you on set? - I'll see you on set. - All right guys, here's on me. - Everyone got one? - Are we cheersing? - Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers, guys. To the Von Ness Film Fest. - Von Ness. - Alright, how you guys liking it here? - Loving it. I cannot wait to start going. - So like, everyone's been talking about this place being haunted. Have you seen anything? - Well, you never know. The other day I was walking around the old Von Ness house and I swear someone was watching me. But when I looked, no one was there. - Creepy. - Are you serious? - Okay, Felix with the sound effects. - And last summer I bartended a private event here a couple of girls went wandering around by themselves and one of them came back crying, claiming she saw a ghost. Her friend was missing. - Are you serious? - Like, night. - Yeah, she's messing with us. - No, no. I'm just saying, you guys, watch out for yourselves. - You think that could really be ghosts? - There is no such thing as ghosts. Okay, but after a couple more these bad boys, we might start seeing all kinds of things. - What do you think? - You're probably right. - There are a lot of legends about this place. - Like what? - Well, apparently the Von Ness film, one of the crew members became obsessed and started killing everyone. - That's bullshit. That is bullshit. You know what, you know what? Bring it on ghosts. I'm ready for y'all. - I don't know. You really shouldn't make fun of them like that. - You're Kidding, right? - The ghosts? - Those were real people that died. - What people? I think we need another round. Yeah. - Yes. - I need another double, bartender. - Tequila all day. - Tequila. - So who's shooting today? - Chad is shooting his Emeline remake and Anne is shooting her witch movie, which sounds really lame, right? - Honestly, between you and me Anne's film puts me to sleep. But Chad, Chad's the real deal. - Yeah. Feel free to help, Kyle. - Oh, Chad? Chad. I'm comin'. - Hail to the guardians of the lands we stand. Sacred fire to protect us. Moonlight to keep us awake. - Oh, my God. - Holy shi... - Cut, is everybody okay? - Yeah. - That was so scary. - I'm sorry. - Hey, can we just hurry up and go for another take please. - Yes, Warren, that's exactly what we're gonna do. Okay, you're doing a great job. All right, I just need you to give me everything you've got in this next take. We're gonna go for another one in five. - Okay. - Cool? Cool, all right. - That might not be possible. - What do you mean, it's just a light. - All the batteries are dead, even the backups. - Yeah, mine are too, it's weird. - Can someone untie me from this tree? - Seriously? What are we gonna do now? - We can film a pickup in the early morning. - Oh, great, so Chad can finish his film before mine. Great. - Does this mean that we're wrapped? - Yeah. - Sweet. - Hey, jeez, you look freezing. Looks like you're... - Thank you. - Done for today. - Do you think someone really messed with the batteries? - No, she probably just forgot to charge then. - I don't know, maybe this place is haunted after all. - Yeah. You really believe in that stuff, huh? - Hey, going to check out Chad's shoot, wanna come? - Sure. - Yeah. - Awesome, come on. - You're leaving? Hello? Can someone untie me from this tree? Hello? - You look beautiful. - Thank you, that's very sweet of you. - Your work today, your work today has been great. Natural. - Good, that's good to hear because I'm trying my best and I'm trying to stay present, you know? - It really shows. It really shows. - Good. So... - What? - About the other night? - Oh, don't worry about that. Look, I need you to focus on this, okay? Now let's talk about the final shot. - Final shot, yeah. - How do you feel? - Well, you know, I kind of wish you'd told me about this before because it wasn't in the original script. - I understand. I didn't tell you about the changes 'cause I needed this sense of surprise and danger and the fire will legitimize those stakes. - I get that. I totally get that, but I'm not comfortable with it. - Okay. Well, I'm gonna make sure that everything is completely under control, okay? - Okay. Fine. John is lying. - Great, that looks great. - Chad, are you sure he know what you're doing? - Yes, I'm sure. - I am really afraid of fire and getting burned and I mean that stuff scares me and I just wanna make sure that everything's under control. - Kelly. I'm a professional. Everything is under control. Okay? - What if I stand outside the cabin? - Okay. I'm starting to feel like you're not really committed to this. Hey listen. Listen to me. I get that you're afraid. All great art comes when you push the boundaries. - Okay. - Do you trust me? - Yeah. - Okay. So you're gonna come into the shack. You're going to stand here, okay. The fire is gonna come in that wall. So just stay away from that wall. You'll be perfectly safe. Can you do that? - Yeah. Okay, I can do that, let's just get this over with. - Okay, great, all right. You're gonna be great. - He just took off. I think this is it. - Yeah, I think this is it. Hey, what are they shooting? - Oh, this is Chad's movie. - Wait. Are they burning the cabin with Kelly inside? - It looks like it. - I wonder if I should, no. - No, no, that's so fucked up. Are you serious? Do we even have people with experience for that in this camp? - Yeah, it's all set up. Okay, Chad's done this sort of thing before and Kelly's a pro, she'll be fine. - No, this is messed up. - Relax, I'm sure they have it under control. This isn't their first rodeo. - Action. - The women have been talking. Should I be listening to them, Silas? Oh, my God, Silas. Silas? There's too much smoke in here. Help me. Help me. Chad, someone's in here, open the door. Help me! Help me! Please open the door! Open the fucking door, Chad! - And cut. - They will find out. - Emiline, please you need to see a doctor. - You have to run. You have to go. - What are you talking about? - Should not be alone in the woods with that man. - Leave now. Emiline, go! - Grace? To whom were you speaking? - No one, I was just... - You weren't at Emiline's judgment? - I know I couldn't bear to witness any of the... - It was hard. The smell alone... - Nonsense. You know why she burned? - I've heard stories. - They're not stories, she seduced a married man. - On the council, no less. - Some women will do anything to be with child. - Then she tried to blame it on our poor councilman. - But she couldn't escape the judgment of God. - You needn't worry. Unless of course you have something to hide? The council brings justice. - Speaking of what is your business with John Warren? - John Warren? Why? What do you mean? - What is done in the dark will come to light. - We shall see you soon, Grace. - John, they'll kill you. John. We cannot do this anymore. Silas he's... - Does he know? - He's suspicious. And he's, I don't know. He's frightening me. - Calm down. All will be well. - Get off my wife! - What disgrace have we come upon here? - A woman willing to desecrate the sacred bonds of marriage. - Silas, please, let us calm down. - Enough. - Silas, please, you must forgive me. Your wife, she came upon me here in the woods and started touching me. I tried to get away, but... - That is not true. He's deceiving you, Silas. - Enough! Enough! - Silas, please you must believe me. How would I betray my brethren? This temptress, this Eve, how could I reframe... - Your sins will be accounted for. We will counsel. - And her? - Emeline? - They'll kill you before sunrise. - What? - These men, they get these ideas. If they want something, they take it. They tell others what they want to hear. A new kind of truth. - John is lying. Emeline. - It matters not. It's what they say you have done. The Councilman told me his wife was in need of assistance, but when we got there, no one was home. He took advantage of my innocents. - I'm sorry. - It's funny. Now I remember how he watched me. How his eyes always felt on me. They were heavy. - Stop. - They were focused. Like I was an itch. - Oh, no, no, no. - They'll burn you because it makes them feel powerful. - Stop. - They'll kill you. They'll burn you alive. - Stop, Emiline. Emiline. - The women have been talking. Should I be listening to them, Silas? My God. Oh my God, Silas? Silas? Silas! Help me, help me. Help me, Silas! Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. - Okay. Ah, wow. What a movie. Wow, chad. Kelly, wow, what a performance. Yeah, Anne? - Just so everybody knows that last shot we just saw was of Kelly actually getting hurt. It wasn't acting. - Wait a minute. I actually, I had no idea she was actually... - That's bullshit, Chad. - As soon as I realized what was happening, I stopped filming and we helped her. - That's not what happened. She literally had to break through a window to get out and you kept filming until she collapsed. - She could have died. - Yeah, okay, that's too much. - Never heard of carbon monoxide poisoning before? - You shouldn't have kept that scene in your film, Chad. - What happened on my set was an accident, okay. I can't change that. I can't change the fact that it happened. I guess I felt like it would be worse if we ended up throwing the footage away because it would've ruined the film and I didn't want to see Kelly go through all that work and I didn't want her to have nothing to show for it. - Are you insane? She should not have been that close to an actual fire. Did you even take a minute to think about the safety of your actor? Have you even apologized to her? - Okay, I think nobody, nobody really wanted Kelly to get hurt. So I think we should just lay off Chad and discuss the movie. - Of course not, no. None of us wanted to see Kelly get hurt and if my actions offended anybody, I'm truly sorry. - I think we should all just relax. I mean, come on, he just showed his movie, it was great. You know, let's just go back to the bar. Let's have the party and have a good time. Just relax, ease any tensions. Just have a good time, you know? Follow up and head for the party, okay? - Kelly, look I'm so sorry you had to go through that. - Are you okay? - I saw something. - Saw what? - I, ur... I saw um... I don't wanna talk about this. I'm sorry. - Let her go. She's been through a lot. She's probably just imagining things. - No. I need to talk to her. - I need a drink. - What are you doing? - Did you follow me? - No, I'm just making sure you're okay. You seemed upset back there. Are you supposed to be in here? - I'm fine. I just left something in here the other night. - Okay, Rose? - How did the screening go? - Great, just great, it went wonderful. Can I please have a bourbon? One bourbon, neat, thank you. - Are you kidding me? - About what? - Do you have any empathy? Do you have any idea how fucking dangerous that was... - That was entirely an accident... - And it just, you just, he just let it happen. - He did... - What, that's so unprofessional. - Where you on set, were you there? - It is so unprofessional. - Or the bottle, the bottle's good. I liked the bottle, the bottle's great. - That bad, huh? - Yep. - Hey, Rose. I'm sorry about earlier, you know, at the cabin. - Don't mention it. - Well, well, no, I, I just, I don't want you to think that I'm like up in your business or... - It's fine. Will you excuse me for a second? - Yeah. - Hey. I just wanted to tell you that I thought it was really brave of you to stand up for Kelly like that. I'm sorry I didn't say more, I just... - You said something. That's all that matters. You have my back, I appreciate it. - Of course. Okay, I'm on that side of the camera too. It could've been any of us. - Hey, are you okay? - All right, everyone? Hey? Hey, great party, huh? All right, can I have everyone's attention please? All right, so we're gonna be moving into the screening room for a little bit of a surprise. Kyle there will lead you. And I'll be there in a second, but all right, I'll meet you guys in there, okay? All right, let's go, come on. - What's going on? Did he film something? - I have no idea. - Hi, everyone. - Hi! - So we've been here for about a week, right? So I think we're like a family now, I think a little bit. So what I wanna show you guys is whatever survived of the behind the scenes footage of my father's last film. So I know you guys have heard all the rumors. And whether they be good or bad, let's see what happens. Here's some behind the scenes footage of "The Devil's Fire". - There's a darkness about the character. Something that's both good and evil. She's someone you must feel rather than see to understand. - What are you writing? - Hey. Just moments. Things I wanna remember. It's kind of like my little way of checking in with myself. - Is there anyone here tonight? - Keep walking. Keep going, walk straight past them. Cut. Get rid of that dress. - Norman, what's wrong with this dress? - It's not the right dress. When you come in and you guys do the... - Acting, just kind of saved my life. If it weren't for acting, I'd probably be dead. This is so stupid. Go ahead. - Is there anybody here? - 1701, what does that mean? - Is that the year you died? - Yeah. - Killed? Jesus. That's not funny. - Did that actually scare you? - Leave her alone. - This place has a pretty dark history that dates back to the 1700s. And that's why I chose this location because nothing is quite as terrifying as reality. - Come on, Norman, you're freaking them out. - I'm not freaked out. I don't believe in fairytales. - I'm not scared. I just don't think we should be playing this game. - I'm a little freaked out. - All right. - Let's go again. - Have you ever done anything like this before? I'm sorry, that's a bitchy question. I'm just stressed out, I don't have enough clothes for the remainder of the shoot. I'm just... - Your stressed out? I'm stressed out. - Norman wants to know when you'll be ready for his fitting, he's waiting. - Hey. - Hi. - He got fire in the script? He knows I'm terrified of fire. - Look, I'll try and talk about it, okay. I'm worried about you. Norman's pushing you too hard. - I'm fine, I'm fine. He just wants me to be a big star, right? - Look, talk to me. - There's nothing to talk about. - What's going on in there? - I'm fine. Okay. - There she is. - Hey, Carly? Hey, babe, Norman's been looking for you everywhere. Carly? Carly? Hey, you okay? Okay, she's not okay, Amy, can you. Hey, babe, are you all right? Amy? Hey, what's going on? You okay? Come here. Why you not wearing shoes? What's going on? - Carly? Carly, come on. Come on, look, I know I've been hard on you, but it's only because I believe in you. Carly, we really don't have time for this shit. Come on, let's go, come on! - How was it like working with Norman? - Norman's just a perfectionist. I can't fault him for that, you know? He expects us to give as much of ourselves as he does. - Norman, where do you wanna start? - We'll pick up where we left. - Okay. - Are you ready? - Yeah. I'm only doing this because I really believe in this film. - Give me five. Real quick, give me five, come on. Can you guys set her up, please? - Okay, got everything under control, all right? - Yeah. - Okay, come, call it. - All right, quiet on set! Everyone go to your marks. Roll sound. - Scene five Delta, take one. - Roll camera. Mark it. Action! - Bobby, Bobby, please don't. Bobby, please? - Oh, God, stop, it's burning. - Put it out! - Do something, she's on fire! Oh, my God. - Oh, God. - Shit. - Put it out! - Somebody help, somebody do something. Somebody do something. - Somebody get a medic! - What happened out there was an accident. Fortunately, we can't go back and change things. All we can do now is move forward. I mean, we can do to throw away all this footage with it throw away Carly's life's work, or pull ourselves together and just finish the last couple of scenes we have left. - No. - That is what Callie would want. - This is your fucking fault. You pushed her too hard. - Fine, fine. Let's call it. Let's call it a wrap, let's call the cops. Let's just go bury Carly forever. That's exactly what's gonna happen if we don't finish. What I'm suggesting is we immortalized her. We have ever live forever through this film. - I say we finished. I agree. - It's crazy. - Carly's dead. Do you get that? Fuck you, Norman. - You are an asshole. - Let's do it. - Norman? - Where is she? Where is she? - What's happening? - Who moved her? Who moved her? - I saw her, I saw her she's alive. - There's smoke, everyone out, let's go. - Oh my God, oh my God, no. - Your father kept filming? - I'm sorry. - Your father kept shooting after Carly died? - As you saw in the film, the cast and crew had a lot of big decisions to make. - Fuck you, your father was a fucking murderer. - Thank you. Thanks for sharing this with me, guys. - Hey, Rose, hey? That's what I'm saying, Rose, no one's ever seen this before. - Not the same. - I don't even know, it was incredible. - Incredible? - Yeah. - I just watched the death of one of the most inspiring actresses in history and the director wanted to keep filming. You call that incredible? I call it murder. - Okay, well, I get it's heavy stuff. Rosemary, come on. Rosemary? - Can somebody tell me what he was possibly trying to accomplish by showing us that right now? - I wish I could tell you. - It was fucking traumatic. - Scare us, yeah. - What the fuck are we even doing here? Guys, we came here to make a few Von horror films. And instead now we were forced to watch Peter gloat over lost footage of his father's dead actors. Seriously, that's disgusting. - Peter didn't see it that way. - Of course he didn't see it that way. What sort of a decent human being would watch that and think that it's worth sharing? Let alone with all of us right here, where it happened. For what? Tell me for what? - For us to do our work better. - What? Fuck that, it's not worth it. - I sacrificed a lot to be here. I'm gonna stay. You have a film to finish. - He has no respect. He has no respect for any of us. He would not have shown that to us, if he had some respect. I'm getting the fuck out of here. We all should. - She's right. - Yes. - So what was that all about? - I think you should go apologize. - No. No, why the fuck should I apologize? What the fuck did I do? She walked out on me. It's unprofessional. Why would she do that? - Yeah, I guess some people can't handle that kind of thing. Where did you get that footage? It's insane. - This isn't the fucking point, really. - Peter, listen, I think the best thing is for all of us to just stay on the same page. Just apologize. - If she's gonna fucking talk to me and insult me, walk out on me for something bullshit like that, I'm trying to fucking show you guys a piece of my heart and she's gonna insult me and walk out. 'Cause it's like, it's a unprofessional a little bitch. - Yeah, you know some girls get. Just go say something. - Okay. I know where she... - Good choice. - Hey, where do you think you're going? - Yeah, you're right and I don't plan on dying here. - Carly didn't plan on dying here either. - Heads up. - Hey guys. Hey, wanna talk about what happened in there and just wanna apologize. - Do you? - I mean it, I really, I should have said something. I should've mentioned it. I should've warned you. If I knew you guys wouldn't be able to handle it. I would have changed... - Handle it? What the fuck is wrong with you, Peter? Your father watched Carly die and wanted to keep filming? That's sick. - Hey, his dad died that day too, all right. - Yeah and we're all really sorry about that. - We all had to watch it. - We all saw it happen. - I'm getting the fuck outta here. - How are you even gonna do that? You gonna walk? - We're in the middle of nowhere. - I don't know. I'll figure it out first thing in the morning. - Hello? Is anybody here? What's going on? - Put it out! - Do something. She's on fire. Oh, my God. - Put it out! - Somebody help, somebody help, somebody do something. Somebody do something. - Someone get a medic! - Pick red or black? - Black. - Rose, are you okay? - I think I saw something. I saw Carly, she was bleeding. - Rose, calm down. Wait, what? Who did you see? - Carly Skye. She was covered in burns and she was really hurt. - You saw her too, huh? - What? - Yeah, I saw her just before the accident. - Wait, you saw what, a ghost? - Yes and I think she wants to speak to us. - Wait, wait, wait, Kelly, Rose, what did you see? Hang on. - Kelly, you really saw her? - Uh-huh. - Do you remember where you were when you saw her? Can you take us there? - What? When? - Right now. Go ahead, Rosemary, we're gonna follow right behind you, okay? We'll be right there. Tell us where we're going, Rosemary? - To the woods. - And what are we gonna find? - Carly Skye. - This is Rosemary. She's an actor at our film festival. She just saw a ghost in the woods and she's taking all of us to the place where she just saw her about 15 minutes ago. Tell us what she looked like. Give us details. What's her skin peeling off. - Stop. - Okay, I'll stop asking. - No stop filming. - Is something wrong, Rosemary? - I'm sorry, but this isn't just a movie to me. Okay, I really saw Carly. - This is about reality. Chad did this over the top short, where he was trying to push boundaries and his actor got hurt for real. Peter's father, he did the exact same thing. - I'm not a character, okay? I'm not acting. - Right. And everybody else will see that, this is who you really are. Look at Kelly. You owe this to her. So that everybody else will believe her too. - Come on, Rose. Come on, let's let's go get this bitch on film. - Just go without me. - No, we need you. Carly chose you. - What are you doing? - I found it in the closet at the party. I think it's one from Peter's behind the scenes. - Just put it away, okay? - You know, Peter's probably behind all this. He's probably just doing this to scare you guys. - It's real. It's Carly. And Rose saw her too. - Hey? Who's there? - Kelly? - What? - Put your hand on it. - No. Where's Anna and Rose, we should be there. I should be there. - Rosemary, you said this is where you saw her. So just go in now. She's not gonna jump out and grab you. - Rosemary? Oh my God, there you are, Jesus. Hey, hey? - Are you done, ruining my shot yet, Simon? - Anne, oh my God. So wait, is this like a real Blair Witch? Which is that the premise. - Simon, not now. - Have you found anything yet? Anne, no comment. - What was that? - I don't know, I think they said something about screening. - Hey guys, do you see the ghost? Come on, Rosemary, let's go. Come on. - Let go. I'm not going with you and this time I mean it. - Rosemary, we don't have time for this. - Well, just go on all right, they're screaming. If you really think there's a ghost, then you should probably go check that out. - If? - Yes, if. You don't even believe I saw Carly. You're just using me for your fucking film. Just like Chad use Kelly. - That is not true. - Yes, it is. - Fine. I'll go by myself. Just stay right here. Guys? Guys? - Oh, my God. Hey, hold up. Listen. So I am making a behind the scenes film. Do you wanna help out? Rosemary, what are you thinking? - Nothing. - Oh, my name is Rosemary and I do not tell Simon what I think because I like to be very, very mysterious and... Oh my God, I think that's the house from the Von Ness film. I bet we can film inside. We can probably break in, right? Let's go. - You go. - What are you scared? - I just need a minute alone. - Come on, if you're not scared, let's... - Just one fucking minute alone. - Okay, Jesus, I'm sorry, I'll be over here. Oh my God, Jesus. What the fuck was that? Hey, come back. - Last night was so weird. Didn't get any sleep last night. I'm super tired. - My burns. - Getting better. - Yeah, they are. Rose, where were you? We were looking for you last night. Rose? - Yeah, I went back to the Von Ness house looking for you guys, but you weren't there. - Are you okay? - What? Rose, were you with Simon last night? - Are you okay? Seriously? Come inside, okay. - Are these rewrites? - Have you seen "Evil Dead". The original "Evil Dead"? - No. - All right, well just, it's just look, it's just gonna be a lot of camera movement and gore, okay. - Is there a reason why I'm getting a spiked filled mask hammered to my face? - I don't know, just ask Simon when he gets here, okay. It's his film. - Well, at least I don't die first. - Chad, he still hasn't shown? - No. - He's not his room. His bed's made up and it doesn't look slept in. - What? - Oh, my God. - So Simon is a no show, are you still going to shoot? - Let's just shoot this fucker. I'm ready to get on screen and kill these girls. - Let's do it, please. - We're gonna lose our daylight hours soon, if we don't move. - We gotta move, Trev. What do you wanna do? - What are we all doing with our thumbs up our asses? - Nice to see you too, Anne. - Hey, you haven't seen Simon, have you? - Not since he was wandering around last night, sabotaging my shots. Why? - We can't find him? - Well, when you do tell him he's an asshole. - Why? - He'll know why? - Where are you guys last night? - Von Ness house. Pretty creepy. Don't go there alone. - Great, so what are you gonna do? - Come on, let's just shoot without him. - Yes. - Come on, dude. - No, I promised him he could direct this script. - Dude, are you serious right now? Really? This is ridiculous, unprofessional. - Think he's in here? - One way to find out. - Simon? Try and break it open. - Think we're gonna break through? Go down, check the sides. Simon? Simon? - Guys, I got something! - Shit, his camera. Jackpot. - See if we can get this. Oh, man. - Who was that? - I didn't know he was into some art house shit. - Not funny, man. - I don't know, it looks pretty real to me. - Is there rewind. - I don't know, man, something doesn't feel right. - I'm gonna see if I can check inside that house. - Come on, there's literally no way something bad happened to him. - Simon? - Look, man, I gotta call the cops. - No, no, it's like a police... - I don't care, I gotta call the police. - Trevor. - Trevor. - Simon? - Trevor. - Come out, Simon. - Simon. Simon? - Look, I know it doesn't show much but it's safe to say that this... - Simon's been going since last night. I know something's happened to him. We've been looking for him all day and you know... - And this was intended to be a horror film? - Mrs. Riley? - Detective Riley. - Detective Riley. Look, I was just as skeptical as you, but if you go back and look at the footage, clearly someone's there, okay. We've been looking for him all day. I'm just saying that that person in that footage, knows something. - We just think it sort of looks like Rosemary. One of the actresses here. - She was filming with Anne last night, so it could've been her. - Okay, who's Anne? - She's one of our film directors. - So Simon was all filming with Anne last night? - That's what she said to us this morning. - So Simon's out making horror films and you guys think he's missing? Are you sure he's not having a little fun at your expense right now? Okay, well, my partner's out searching the grounds. I need a full description of Simon. Age, height, weight, tattoos, birthmarks? And where can I find Anne and Rosemary? Did you make this? - No. God, no. - Are you sure? - I wouldn't make anything like this. - Find anything? - No, nothing. - When was the last time you saw Simon? - When he ran off. - Do you know where he ran off to or who he was with? - No. You guys don't think that have anything to do with his disappearance, do you? That's crazy. - Okay, well, if anyone finds any information about this video, don't hesitate to call. - What about Rosemary? - Right? Who's Rosemary. Do you know anything about this? What were your whereabouts last night? - I was with him when we were shooting, but I lost track of him. - I mean, looked just like her. - It could've been any of us. Sheila looks like me, maybe it was her. - Oh, so you're blaming me now? - Easy. If he doesn't show up by tomorrow, we'll mobilize a search unit and bring in forensics. - Tomorrow? What are we supposed to do now? - Let us do our jobs. And if you guys find anything, if anything changes, give us a call. - So I have to know, did people actually die here or what? - Sheila? - I wouldn't worry yourself about the past. But I will say that you picked a hell of a place to shoot horror films. - I swear, Rosemary had to have something to do with it. - So we gonna do something or what? - Honestly, I think we should just wait for the police, guys. - No, we get it on film and we make it a movie. - Amber might as well skin me and wear me, all the girls on her side are wearing my outfit. Hey, I've been looking all over for you. What are you guys up to? - We're just drinking some beers, Sheila, going over a shot-list for Trevor's short. - Oh, I wanna be in it. - Trevor? - Maybe. - That would be so awesome. The last two I was in where... - Whatever Sheila. - Were you in Anne's film last night? - Oh God, yeah. Hot mess. - What about Simon? Are you fucking kidding me? - So she's playing the victim. - I don't know. All I know is she's a fucking weirdo. - I think, I think we should shoot it. - Yeah. - I don't know, guys. I don't think it's a good idea. - Do what? - Hey Sheila, you wanna help us make this movie? - I'll get more than three lines, right? - Yes. What'd you say boys? - I'm out. I got my screening. - Have fun watching me. - Oh, I will. - Let's make a film. - Hello? Open the door. No, no. No. No, no. - Where's the lamp? - What the fuck are you doing, are you crazy? - Shut your mouth. I know you know, tell us everything you know. - What the fuck? - I'm gonna ask you the questions, you're gonna answer them. Do you understand me? - What the fuck are you guys doing? You're fucking crazy. - Tell us everything. I know you know. - I'm not gonna hurt ya. Confess, tell us what you know. - What the fuck? Please stop. - Confess. - Confess your sin. - What are you talking about? - Gods good children always deserve a second chance. - What the fuck do you guys want? - Help him. - No, please, no. - Just tell us what you know, and we will let you go. Talk. Confess. - I'll do what you want, okay. Just let me go. - Shh, don't be frightened. You'll now be closer with God. - No, no, no. Sheila, please! This isn't a game, they're really gonna hurt me. - Tell us where Simon is. We know you did something to him. - Confess, Rose. - What? This is not Simon. Oh my God, what the fuck? No, look, I didn't do anything, okay. I have no idea where he is. You have to believe me, okay? All I remember was we were shooting in the woods, but it was dark, okay. I lost track of him. I didn't do anything to him. - What? Get the lighter fluid. - What? - Sheila, get the lighter fluid now. - Sheila, no, please, no. - God damn it, Sheila! - No! - Come on, let's talk to her. Sheila! - It's just you and me now. Are you gonna tell me where my brother is? - Let me go and I'll do what you want. - Help me now. - I'll show you. - No, tell me where he is? - Untie me and I'll show you. - Fine. - Do it. - Hello? Hello? - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for Peter, I think something's wrong. I saw some guys hurting Rosemary. - What do you mean, like a film? - No, kind of, I don't know. - Okay, okay, I'll be right back, all right. - Okay. Grisly accident mires casting crew to death. - Hey? - Peter, thank God. - What are you doing here? - I think some guys are hurting Rosemary. We have to call the police. - Whoa, nah, we're just trying to scare her for a film. We were making a movie. - Is it you guys that she's talking about? - We have to go. No, they were hurting her. I swear. - Look, we'll show ya. We'd be happy to show ya. - I swear they were hurting her. - Yeah. Yeah, sure, okay. Yeah, let's go. Relax, relax. We'll go find out what's wrong. - Right up here. Sorry. I think it's through here. Just watch out. Oh my God! - Oh, shit. - Oh my God! - Oh my God! Simon? Is this Simon? - Jesus. - Help me. Simon? He's not breathing. - We have to get the hell outta here! - No, no, whoever did this is still out there. You just stay here. - He has Von Ness carved into his chest. Right here. Why, why? - I don't know! - Trevor? Where's Trevor? - Let's go! Let's go! - Trevor. We need to find Trevor, I think he's in trouble. Trevor? - We can't we can't just leave him here. - He's dead. Trev? Hey, Trevor? Come on. - Trevor. - Trevor? - Trevor? - Hey, Trev? - Trevor? - Trevor? - Trevor. Trevor? Trevor, Trevor? Trevor? - We need to call the police. We need to call the police. - Sheila! Sheila, Sheila! - What happened? Who did this to you? - Rosemary. - Trevor, Trevor? Trevor. Trevor. He said Rosemary, he said Rosemary, we left him with Rosemary, she must've done this. We need to find Rosemary. - She's possessed. We need to find Rosemary. - She's possessed. - What is going on? - We need to find her right now! - Fuck, yeah. - Has anyone seen Sheila? She was so excited about that screening of Felix's slasher film. - Girl, she's probably out stalking Chad. - Yeah, I second that. - All right, well, bye ladies. - Bye. - Enjoy. - Come on, come on, come on. Fuck, yeah. Simon's dead, they're after me, I need help. - I can hardly hear you. - It's Sheila from the film camp, they're gonna kill me. I need help. - Who is this? - Hello? - Hello. - Hello? Fucking shit, fuck. Shit! - I hope she's okay? They're gonna start any minute now. - This festival is fun and everything, but I am so bored of screaming and getting killed. - I will scream and cry and die all day long, - Well, let's hear it. - Okay. Oh, a challenge. Last little bit there, Oscar worthy, I think. - Yeah. I was on set with her yesterday and it was so funny because she was supposed to die and when Ryan went to kill her, she seriously went like this. - Come on, you gotta love that girl, does not know how to scream. - Or act. - Guys? Come on, don't be so hard on her. - Okay. Fuck, Marry, Kill. Chad with no teeth. Felix, but he talks the whole time. Or Simon and he's filming it with like a GoPro on his head. - Jo wants Simon. - Oh my God, no. I can't believe he killed her. - It's time for harvest. - Oh my God! - Peter, why she tied to a stake? - Hear our plea, for must cast this evil spirit that dwells within this woman out. And burn it outta her flesh. In the name of the borne and the sacred and the name of the brothers that came before us. - Peter, what are you talking about? - I think those are the lines from his dad's movie. - I present to you a temptress. - We need to go. We need to go! Go! Oh my God. - Chad and Trevor just fucking tortured and kidnapped me. - Wait, what the fuck? You can't be serious? - Are you okay? - Look, I am serious, okay. Ask Sheila, she was there too. - What? - Sheila? - What, why would they do that? - They think I killed Simon. - What? - That's insane. Why, what happened, what... - You guys have fucking lost it, okay. Peter's convinced that Simon's dead and that I killed him. - What? - Oh my God. - Okay, wait. - No, wait. We've just been filming a bunch of violent shit and we're in this weird ass fucking place. Simon can't be dead and no one's coming after you. - Yeah. - Yeah. We know these guys they're soft. I don't think they would do anything like that. - I mean, does anybody know for a fact that Simon's dead? - No. - I mean it to me, this just sounds like a really fucked up joke, you guys. - Yeah. - Look, all I know is that they fucking cornered me in the woods, put a sack over my body and tie me to a cross. - What? - Are you serious? - And Ryan was there too, okay, he filmed it. - Okay, okay. - What? - It's insane. - Okay. He made it a shitty movie, okay. He's just trying to scare you, you're safe here. We are all safe here. Okay? - I don't think so. - Please don't hurt me! - Oh, my God! - Oh, shit. This that from Felix's movie? - Did you see that? - Yeah, what the fuck. - It sounds like it's going pretty good. - No, no, this looks real. - What's going on now? - Shit! - What is that? - Oh my God. - What the fuck? - Who is that? - What is that? - Sheila, is dead! We were at the screening and... - She's just burnt alive. Her face, was the scariest... - The guys did it. - Burnt off of her. - Is this really happening? - Guys, I'm telling you, they're coming here right now. - What do we do? - We can't sit and wait. - Shit, shit, shit! No, shit, shit, shit. - Calm down, calm down. - No, no. - Hey, hey, what's going on? - She just died in front of us. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - It was Sheila. - Sheila, just fucking burnt. - Wait, wait, wait, who? - It was Sheila. It was Sheila. - She's fucking dead. - What the fuck just happened out there? - She burst through the fucking screening and dropped dead. - Her skin was bubbling. - What do you... - Stay calm, stay calm. - Where is everybody? - They all fucking ran. - What the fuck do you mean, they ran? - We got outta there, there's a dead body. - Let me know what you need me to do? - You go find everybody. - You handle the dead body, okay, I'll make sure everybody's okay. - You know, find everybody and bring them to the fucking cabin, okay? - Gotcha, gotcha, all right, man. Guys, come on, come on. - Go, okay? - Is there an explanation? - Yeah, come on. Guys, I've got you. - I thought it was Rosemary... - What the fuck, man? - I thought it was Rosemary. - Ryan, we need to find Rosemary and this ends, okay. Find Rosemary. Go to the cabins and find her. - Fucking find her. - What do we do? - What the? - It's either us or them. - Rosemary, I need to talk to you right now. - Stay away. - You don't know who you're dealing with, this psychopath killed Trevor. - Trevor? - Trevor is dead and she killed him. - I don't believe you. - He tortured me. - That's bullshit. We need to stop this before she hurts anybody else. - Your just manipulating me. - Anne, don't listen to him. He's trying to kill us. - Ryan? - He tried to kill me. - Ryan? I found her. Ryan? - It was either him or me. - What the fuck did you do, man? What did you do, you stupid bitch. - Rosemary, run! Run! - Stay outta this. Peter was right, you're behind this. It was you. It was you. It was you. - Anne? Anne? - Oh my God. Rose, what happened? What happened, Rose? - She's dead. - Oh, my God. - Chad killed her. - What do you wanna do? - I want this to end now. Where you going, Chad? - What took you so long? - Had some loose ends I needed to tie up. Now, Chad, don't try to run. If you do, I'll hurt you. - You'll never take me alive. Witch. - You're fucking sick. - This is for Carly. - Only 'cause you wanted to be like some shitty actress. - This next scene is a tough one. Are you ready for your close-up? - So where do we start? - Let's pick up where we left off.
