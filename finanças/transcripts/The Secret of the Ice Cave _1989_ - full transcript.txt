♪ Uh, not again. Your father will see you now. Your son, Mr. Geiger. Good to see you, Alex. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. How's school? It's still summer vacation, Mr. Geiger. Please, Alex, I've asked you to call me Dad. My dad is dead. Well, since your mother and I are engaged, don't you think it would be nice to start treating each other like family? Look, Mr. Geiger, I know what a busy man you are, and everything, so why don't we just cut to the chase, huh? About our trip to South America, I'm afraid, it has to be canceled. What? Canceled? I haven't even seen my mom in almost a year. It seems you mother is on the brink of making... BOTH: Major scientific discovery. And it'll be a bad time to visit her, right? You know how important your mother's research is to the medical world. Besides, I have an emergency stockholders meeting. It's just not possible. How about an advance on my allowance? Alex, this is the third time you've asked for an advance on your weekly stipend. Where does all the money go? I bought a notebook and some gum, that was a whole five bucks. Luxury items? If you hadn't spent all your money on that computer, maybe you won't be so broke, all the time. I won this in the Junior National Math Competition. You could have cashed out on it. Look, I don't want to sound like a hard ass but your mother expects me to be responsible for you, fiscally responsible. A young man needs to learn the value of a hard earned dollar, and how to spend it. No hard feelings? No. I understand. You're a man. I'm just a boy. There's still a lot I need to learn from you. Right? Dad? I'm touched, Alex. [TYPING] [READING] "Hola. Que tal? Como se llama?" [SIGHS] Why didn't I take French? Fantastic! You got one, right? -Yes. Yes, and it just passed the first test. -Let's see it. It chose to hide in the tree. And since spiders are supposedly arboreal, there is a good chance that you theory is correct. The crimson toed tarantula may actually exist. That is great. So when do you think you can have a positive ID? I have no idea because this one is a male. Only the female carries the poison sac and the coloration. Where she is, nobody knows. [HUMMING] -TALBOT: Get it in there. -No. No. -Don't lose it now. -Don't, don't. Oh, imagine... A red-toed tarantula causing instantaneously... Sounds like a Grimm fairytale. It'll be in reality, soon enough. [HUMMING] You know, I predict, that this research project of yours will end up being the greatest pharmaceutical discovery since Aluminum Chlorohydrate. Well, let's hope that your chronic optimism is contagious. Uh-uh! Don't confuse optimism as greed. I mean, that spider venom might be the first natural cure for insomnia. -You want me to go right back out there, don't you? -Aye. It only makes sense, I mean, if you're this close. This is your lucky day, because I want to go back out there. -I'm going. -[CHUCKLING] Atta girl. You know, this is a great jacket. -It's so nice... -Thank you. My son gave it to me for our anniversary. You're not married yet. -Through my husband himself, my late husband. -Oh. Well... I'm sorry your visitors won't be coming. Well, it's okay. Looks like everybody's got too much work to do. [HUMMING] Okay. [CONTINUES HUMMING] [SIGHS] -Business trip? -Oh, Lord, no, I'm visiting my daughter. She goes to college in Santiago. I wouldn't miss her birthday for the world. My birthday was last week. [SPEAKING SPANISH] This plane goes where you want. There comes the plane, American pilotowill help you. No problem. ALEX: Great. [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, hey, excuse me, bud, if your plane is going back to Puyehue, I'd like to get a ride with you, man. Well, I have business to attend to, so bug out. Sir, you don't understand, my mother... Listen, you little turd, I said, "Bug out!" What a jerk. Here's what you asked for. Mmm-hmm. And? Thanks, Frank. -I want the map. -What map, Frank? You crazy son of a bitch. You stole our property. You're lucky to be getting out of this alive. Now, hand it over. Now. Sure thing, Frank. What's this shit? It's the map, Frank. A friend of mine put it on disk. You expect us to buy something I can't see? Oh, you're biting my ear, Frank. Look, I don't expect anything from him. But even if it was on that map... Ow! How did you know it was real or not, I mean... Either way you got to trust me. If you're playing with us, you're dead. Plain and simple. Oh, no. Oh, I'm not dumb enough to cross a genius like you, Frank. A man couldn't be that stupid. Okay, we got a deal. To your health. To my health, Frank. [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] You know, I've been wondering for the last couple of hours, you know, saying to myself, Billy Wright, William Zane Wright. What is that kid doing at the back of your brand new jet? Or is he a part of the new turbo option package. [LAUGHS] I don't know. Two hours and I haven't figured it out yet. Hi. Hey, wait, you're not the pilot. Sorry, sorry, who is you? No, that other guy. The jerk? Oh! That guy sold me the plane. [LAUGHS] Don't tell me we're not going to Puyehue. Buddy boy, that is the last place on this sweet earth that we are bound for. This is a non-stop flight for Miami. Well, I got to get out of here. Well, we'll be passing that place in a couple of minutes. Be my guest. [BILLY CHOKING] Do you need any medication? [LAUGHING] Not for this round. I've been poisoned. [LAUGHS] Poisoned. By him, Frank Hagen, the stupidest man in South America. The embarrassment. [LAUGHING] ALEX: Fly! Tell me what to do. -ALEX: Don't do this. -Please excuse me. ALEX: Come on, you got to wake up. BILLY: Nicely done. -They got shit to pay for. -ALEX: You have to fly your plane. BILLY: Shit! Shut up and think. You got balls, kid. And you got brains. Here. I'm giving you the my everything, boy I'm only... I've put it in clues, see, in case, they came after me. In case there isn't time to get away. So you got some things to figure out, boy. But if you're a rocket scientist then you can find the blue rocks, millions and millions of dollars. And you'll be rich. Filthy rich. ALEX: Wake up! [ENGINE SPUTTERING] ALEX: Wake up! -Wake up! -Blue rocks. Shiny... Sparkling, like crystals in the sea. Find them... ...and you'll find $15 million. Altitude, 55 feet. Speed divided by distance traveled, take the inverse... Come on, when do I jump? [READING] You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. So beautiful. Come on, boy. Come, boy. Walk it off. Vamos. Hola. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Who's that? -Just another strung out hippie. Hey, wait a second. Uh, give him another empty hut for the night. He could stay until morning. Uh, excuse me, sir. -My name is Alex Ostrow... -Dr. Talbot, nice to meet you, kid. Yeah, but... Ow! [GROANS] What's the matter kid, sick or something? -Take him to medical. -Okay, good idea. Come on, boy. -What happened to Billy? -What? Are you the Miami contact? I don't know what you're talking about. I... I want to find my mom, Dr. Valerie Ostrow. She's a very important scientist around here, so if you want to keep your job, you better get out of my way. -Hey, what are you doing? -What happened to him? -Leave my stuff alone. -Where's Billy? -I don't know who you're talking about. -Don't mess with me, gringo. Billy's my partner. I want to know what happened to him. Billy's dead. Some guy named, Frank Hagen, poisoned him. Look, I don't even know how I got here. I just want to find my mom. She's in the field. She won't be back for days. And if I were you, I'd disappear, too. Don't trust anyone. Not if you plan on staying alive. Pop will be going home soon, poopsie-whoopsie. Blah-blah-blah. Oh, yes... Would you mind giving it to me already, we've got to get our work done. -Not that, the disk. Come on. -Oh. You just saved the god damn plan. I suppose I can use the, uh... Hello, Dr. Talbot, my name is Laticia. Would you like to kiss me? [MOANING] Oh, Christ. Look at that. Oh, you're a great kisser. Would you like to take off my bra? Billy was a good kid, boss. Everything was a game to him, you know. Maybe the map... Drop my little skirt. You're really getting me so hot, tough guy. Please rip it off. You think this is funny? LATICIA: Come on. Come on. Her bazookas might be two mountains and her belly button might mean some little lake. Her... [SNICKERING] LATICIA: Come on, Doctor. You think this is funny? I screwed you boys, isn't that good?[LAUGHS] Billy? I don't get it, Frank. How could this happen, huh? I don't understand it. BILLY: The blue rocks. Sparkling, glittering. Find them. This god damn ridiculous animal. -We wouldn't be able to stop that mess. -Don't talk shit about Red! TALBOT: Red, Schmed, the damn dog doesn't even know who you are. Taking a vacation a little early, aren't you, Santos? [GRUNTS] [BEEPING] BILLY: Hello, my friend. This is my present for you. If you want to play the game, be smart. Follow the map step by step. At the end of the game, you'll find the treasure, $15 million. And you'll be rich. Filthy rich. And don't forget, you have to be a rocket scientist. TALBOT: Wash your hands. I hate it when it splashes on my shirt. Ew, you sick thing. MonsieurGei? Come in. Come in, MonsieurGei. Come in, MonsieurGei. MonsieurGei, come in. This is Victor, calling MonsieurGei. MonsieurGei? Can you hear me? What the... [BEEPING] [PRINTER WHIRS] Hey, stop what you're doing. He cut the power. The program is damaged. TALBOT: I got him. ALEX: Hey, wait, let... Let go of me. TALBOT: Hold him! FRANK: Yeah... -Easy, boy. -TALBOT: Hold him down! FRANK: Hold on. TALBOT: He's got the watch. [ALEX YELLING] ??? TALBOT: took my Rolex. [STARTS ENGINE] Damn it! Start. Start. Why won't you start? [ENGINE SPUTTERING] Oh, come on. Forget it. [TIRES SCREECHING] [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] [YELLING] [SCREAMS] -[BELLS JINGLING] -[SHEEP BLEATING] Please, don't run away. Me, not God, fall from sky. -Me, Alex, American teenager. -What? What? What do you want? You scared off all my sheep. You speak English. Well, you're the one who saved my life, aren't you? Seems I'm always in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Well, I... I still want to thank you, very much. My name is Alex. Thank you, very much. What are you doing here, anyway? Isn't there some other place you can hurt yourself? Well, my mother is a scientist at chemical research facility... Your mother's the spider woman? Wait, she's not exactly Sonia Braga or anything but anyway why... That still doesn't explain what you're doing in the middle of the jungle for the second time in two days. My mother's real busy, that's all. So I thought I'd do some sightseeing on my own. Say, do you know where the Choshuenco Volcano is? They say it's quite beautiful this time of year. I know where the Choshuenco is. I know every inch of this area. Hey. Hey, give me my map back. El Tatio Geyser, the Volcano, the Torrio swamps? This doesn't look like "Chile in $10 a day." What is this, anyway? What are you up to? It's just my map. Give it back. Not if you're going to keep lying. Okay. Okay. It's... it's a treasure map. I'm telling you the truth. It leads to something called the blue rocks. What do you know about the blue rocks? Well, if you start acting like a human being and give me my map back, I might tell you. And I might even invite you to join me on a quest of mythological proportions. -You can invite me on the way there. -Where? To see the wise man at the village. -Oh, hi, honey. Who's your friend? -Hi, Daddy. Alex, this is my father, Manny Wise. -Hi. -Hello, sir. What's going down Mr. Brown? Alex is the spider woman's offspring. Oh, he... Oh, really? Wow. She buys all her supplies from us. And for an imperialist, working for an exploited multinational corporation, you know, she's fairly groovy. Why don't we go inside and talk? Well, I have to finish these baskets and I have to clean up, obviously. Alex wants to hear some of your stories. Daddy knows everything there is to know, about the history of this region. Well, I don't know about that. I know a few things. But, uh... Oh, why not? Come on in. -Uh, where've you been all morning, honey? -Herding sheep. Yeah, and you picked up a stray here, called Alex. -Well, where are you from, Alex? -LA. LA? Go away, LA! I couldn't stand LA. The conquistador of Chile, Francisco de Valdivia left South America in the end of the 16th century. Spanish soldiers discovered the hidden Inca city of Talauaktan. And they stormed the mountain fortress and they slaughtered 10,000 Indians. What they were after is only legend but the story is that they had discovered the sacred chest in the king's chambers, containing the most precious and rare jewels on earth. Blue diamonds. Thousands of them. All shimmering. The icy color of a glacier. All the great Inca heroes are the ones who tracked the soldiers down and killed them. But the blue diamonds were not found. They remain lost till this day. They're supposed to be hidden somewhere to the north of here. It's just a legend, as legends go. But every year, teams of grave robbers come here to dig up and destroy in their selfish search for useless riches. You know some pretty wild stories, Mr. Wise. History of the world is a wild story, young man. When did you say your mom is picking you up? Uh, she's so busy in the field right now, she hardly even knows I'm around. So I thought Ona might... Alex, would you mind waiting outside for a second? Why? I just need a minute to talk to my father into letting me go. -You'll go? That's great. -What's great, kids? Alex and I were thinking of going on a camping trip for a couple of days. You better leave. Daddy? My plane. Who'll take care of the sheep? They'll need shearing soon. Not for another month. It's only for a day or two. Or three or four. I can't afford to let you go that long. Daddy, why don't you say what you're thinking? -That's exactly what I'm doing. -No, you aren't. There's nothing to worry about. Believe me. I'm not worried. I... I know you can take care of yourself. I have complete confidence in you. -Then I can go? -Absolutely not. It's not you I'm worried about. Maybe if you hadn't stayed celibate since mom had died, you'd stop seeing sex everywhere. When was the last time you even kissed a girl? Oh, that's none of your business. I guess all that talk about women's rights was just talk. At heart, you're really just one big conservative. Don't you swear at me. And don't try to make me sound like a hypocrite in order to get your own way. Does that mean I get my own way? I want to know exactly where you're going. -All right? -Okay. You take good care of my Ona. Now, you're positive that no one else knows about this map? What do I look like, a bullshitter? TALBOT: No. No, no. Absolutely no problem, MonsieurGei. I'm just cleaning up a few loose ends, that's all. I couldn't find the kid. I've been looking all over and I couldn't find him anywhere. GEI: I hope you speak the truth, Victor? For your sake, for the sake of your children. -You should be aware of that at least by now. -TALBOT: Right. Like I said, the pickup will be ready and waiting for you, on Thursday. Trust me. -I told you the little bird got away. -It's Gei. GEI: Trust is for the weak and a new bride. I have buyers lined up across the globe, in a bidding war, over these goods. So, if my valuables are not there, I will track you down and kill you. Your choice is a simple one, Victor. Die poor or live rich like God. We've got three days. Yeah. Well, it may take three years. That kid really makes me mad. He's like a pro, a real pro. He could be any damn where. Yeah, he could be. But soon enough... [CHUCKLES] ONA: This is the crater of the Choshuenco Volcano. We have to find the skull, buried beneath the wooden cross. That's what the map says. Look. ALEX: Ah! Uh... Something is inside. Ooh, a scorpion. Put the scorpion onto the map at exactly this spot. The length of the scorpion's body will reach from here to only one other landmark. You'll find what you're looking for, there. That must be where the treasure is. All we have to do is kill that scorpion and lay it on the map, right there. No, the animal is sacred. [LAUGHS] I'm not going to let a scorpion come between us and the treasure. All you Americans care about is money. -What about your 50% interest? -I'm giving it to the Indians. -Uh, you're kidding? -No, I'm not, no one needs that much money. Try living in LA. All right, okay, I got another idea. That must be it. Agua Dulce, the town of sweet water. [ALEX CHUCKLES] You see, killing's not the only solution. [TIRES SCREECHING] TALBOT: On the ground. Face down. Move it! Come on! Move it. You, too, little girl. Oh, I know this one. She's the hippie's bastard, the help maid. [ONA SCREAMS] Come on, save it. We've got a lot of work to do. All right, give us the map and we promise not to hurt you too much. Give us the map. And we promise not to hurt you too much. FRANK: Come on, where is it? TALBOT: You don't have all day. Give us the map. FRANK: Come on, where is it? Where is it? TALBOT: We promise not to hurt you. FRANK: Give it here, you bastard. -TALBOT: Come on, save it. We've got a lot of work to do. -Oh, my god, look at that. Shut up, dink. ALEX: But that bag pack is possessed. [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Catch it, Frank! [GUNSHOTS] -Go get the horses. I'll hold them off. -Okay. [HORN HONKING] They fooled us, damn it! They fooled us! [GRUNTING] Ow! -What the hell was that for? -No one else knows about the map, huh? -Hey! I'm really pissed off. -Go! Go! -Go! -I'm gonna kill you, you bastard! [SCREAMING] [GROANING] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [GRUNTS] Ah! -Victor? Victor. Damn it! -Valerie, what are you doing here? -What? -What happened to your face? -Oh, I was just doing a little field work, that's all. -Oh. And my truck was stolen. Can you give Frank and me a ride back to the camp? -Yes, but what happened? -I'll tell you in the car, okay? I got to get out of here. Well, let's just get some supplies... Why don't you do it on the way back? Okay? Or maybe I should. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Manny? [YELLING] -VALERIE: What's going on out here, Frank? -We were playing. You get out of here and wait in the car. -Are you all right? -Where did you get your friends, lady? [HORN HONKING] -Ouch. Well, did he tell you anything? -He doesn't know anything. -Damn it! -I say we get rid of him. I don't know. Could be more useful alive. Oh, I can't believe Alex is here. Well, you better believe that he's stolen something and dragged my daughter into it. I'll get to the bottom of this. -And I'll come back as soon as I can. -I wasn't answered. VALERIE: Victor, why didn't you tell me Alex is here? TALBOT: Take it easy. Well, who's Alex? -My son, Alex, remember? -Your what? Your son? Victor, what is going on? Why did... Why was Frank beating up on that perfectly harmless Manny? -Victor? -How the hell do I know? Why don't you ask him? If you're so scared of those guys, why don't you just give up? I'm not scared. I just don't like liars, that's all. [SCOFFS] Yeah, that's why you told your dad we were going camping. -Technically, we are. -Technically, it's a white lie. Well, since I'm only half white, it's not a whole lie now, is it? Of course, it is. Plus you stole my toy plane. If you shut up for one second, you might realize how beautiful this place is. Here's the church. How much further is that town? Not too far. North, towards the desert. I don't see anything, only desert. Then we'll have to spend the night here. -Why don't you get some wood? -Yes, ma'am. [LAUGHING] [CHURCH BELL RINGS] [LAUGHING] You want some candy? Are you asleep? It's kind of hard when you keep talking. Look, if you hate me so much, I don't know why you agreed to come in the first place. I don't hate you. I never said I hated you. Yeah, but you think I'm a greedy capitalist pig. Don't assume I share all my father's political views. To me you're just a klutz. Don't you think he's, kind of, weird? Your dad, I mean. No, I don't. Oh, no, no. Don't...don't... Don't get me wrong or anything. I mean good weird. I like weird. All my friends, when I get one, you know... They either would be or will be weird. So, uh... Why did your dad move down here? Why did he leave the U.S.? Father was studying anthropology at Stanford, in the '60s. He came here to research his doctorate thesis and just stayed. Really? What was his thesis on? We have to get up pretty early. Come on, I'm not tired. Tell me. He was researching a death of a tribe. For thousands of years, they lived near here, prosperous people. The Wada Indians. They were a brother tribe to the Incas of Talauaktan... Oh, those are the guys who had the blue diamonds ripped off. Yes, but instead of being mountain dwellers they spent almost their entire lives on their fishing boats. They resisted modernization completely, content to live the way they always had lived. But when the Spanish settlers came, and then the British, and the Welsh, and the Germans, their land of ports and harbors were needed for commerce. Still the tribesmen and women would not leave. Where could they go? So they were slaughtered like dogs. And by the 1960s, there was only one left. Your dad did his thesis on him? It was a woman named Mataluna. She taught him the history, the ways of her people, everything. And when she died in 1975, he decided to stay. Mataluna was your mother? I'm really tired. [SPEAKING SPANISH] What did the police say? -That wasn't the police. -What do you mean? Who was it? You don't want the police involved in a family matter. I don't care, as long as we find Alex and Ona. And brand them as runaways? Car thieves? Criminals? When, really, they're just a couple of mixed up teenagers. Look. I've radioed the problem to some local authorities. People I know and trust. Valerie, don't worry about it. Those kids will show up, okay? I'll find them, if it kills them... [CHUCKLES] I mean, kills me. Okay, that's fine. That's fine but I'm still going out there. Even Manny wants to come. I don't think that is necessary. Well, I don't care what you think. It's not your son out there, in the wilderness, and I'm not just gonna sit here and wait. All right, all right, all right, then this is what I suggest. In the morning, you take that Manny guy and you look for them by car, all right? Frank and I will search the area by plane. But promise me one thing, the moment you find them, or any sign of them, radio me. Okay. Okay, that's good. That's great but I'm not waiting until morning. Valerie, look... It's dark outside. You can't see a thing. Besides, it's dangerous. We'll leave in the morning, period. -Okay. -All right. Transmit at 83 megahertz. Remember, the moment you find them, or any sign of them, okay? -Thank you, Victor. -Okay. -I don't know how to say thank you. -That's all right. I... I still love that jacket of yours. [LAUGHS] Goodnight, Frank. I'll see you in the morning, Victor. Can't win them all, turkey. Get the plane ready. We're leaving at the crack of dawn. My neck hurts. Maybe if you took off those Wilma Flintstone necklaces you'd sleep better. I don't take these off, ever. All right, come on, we have a lot of walking to do. You really surprise me. A hippie communist living like a hermit in the middle of the jungle. I mean, you talk about your daughter, you seem so square. I am not a hippie. And I'm not square. I was never square. And I'm not a communist, I'm a socialist. Maybe we shouldn't talk. I seem to make you so uptight. I'm uptight? You know, you're just trying to hip trip me, lady. You're a turn on, tune in and drop out. [LAUGHING] You see, your core's a hippie. I knew I could bring you out. Oh, where else did she say we might find them? The old mission at Socaire. Find something down? Over there. The graveyard of the old miners town. [CHUCKLES] He said you had to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. We just aren't thinking hard enough. This is it. Oh, Alex, don't open it. -But the diamonds might be... -Look. Look, explosives. The miners used them. Oh, shit. Thanks. I'm going to go, look around. Why don't you go the other way and we'll meet the other side. This is nothing but a ghost town. The treasure could be in the town or in the graveyard, the map doesn't say. Look around for some sort of sign. [ONA SCREAMING] Ona! [ONA SCREAMING] Ona, where are you? Ona, stop playing games. Ona! Ona? Ona, stop kidding around. -Ona? -I don't have time to play games anymore. -Come on, just hand over the map, all right? -I lost it. -You what? You lost it, huh? -Ow! Oh! -Ah! -What did you say, you lost it? ALEX: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! All right, maybe you don't care about your own lives... Give me your hands. But surely, you must have some compassion for your parents. -What's that suppose to mean? -Oh, yes, I know who your mother is, Alex Ostrow, and her father. But we're reasonable men, right? [CHUCKLES] Willing to make a reasonable deal. Look, just give me the map, all right? We'll let you and your parents go free. We forget the whole thing. -He's bluffing. -He's not bluffing. Open your mouth. Ramone? Si.Put on the hostages. Valerie, I hope you're not too uncomfortable. [CHUCKLES] -Uh, you should know that I have your son. -Victor? -Victor? -[STATIC] Victor, what did you say? -TALBOT: I've got Alex. -Ask him where Ona is. -Where is Ona? -Where is Ona? I have her, too. -Good -Oh, Manny. -Manny, they found them. -That's wonderful. Only there seems to be a slight problem. They're not hurt, are they? Please, God, tell me they're not hurt. Over. No, they're all right. But they're not cooperating. I can't seem to get them to go along with me, if you know what I mean. Alex? Alex, do exactly as Victor says. Yes, Ona, honey, listen to me. Now you do what he says. We don't want any more trouble. I don't bluff. Now... I made you a deal. Your freedom for the map. -Alex, we have to. -Listen to her. [SIGHS] -You'll let us go? -Alex, I gave you my word. -[SIGHS] It's in my shoe. -Atta boy. -The other one. -Don't push it. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] -All right, you got what you wanted, now let us go. -Nope. -You know too much. -Yeah, but you gave us your word. Welcome to the real world. Now, walk! [ALEX CHUCKLES] The asshole hasn't even asked for his watch back. What did that guy say you had to be, to find the treasure? You had to be really, really smart. No, he said something else. He said you had to be a rocket scientist. Look. ALEX: [READING] "Dr. Olga Volga... she danced and built rockets for Stalin." ONA: Too bad. We got pretty close. ALEX: To the treasure or to each other? Both, I guess. Finished? All right. Let's do it. Uh, wait! Um, can I get a last request? No. Come on, it's only a cigarette. Alex, as a doctor, I cannot in good faith. [LAUGHS] Oh! What the hell! Oops! Here. [COUGHING] Thanks. That was refreshing. All right, as the French say, bon voyage. [SCREAMS] [TALBOT GROANING] Oh, it's another clue. -What is it? -It's another disk. We need a monitor. -[SIGHS] -[PLANE HOVERING] -Run! -[SCREAMS] All right! Whoo-hoo! Got to be more careful, I think, there's a national park. [LAUGHING] You shoot like my grandma, doc. They can't fly into the sandstorm. -Where are we going? -To the nearest town. [WIND HOWLING] FRANK: The sand's clogging them out. TALBOT: All right, head to Sierra Gorda. We'll meet them out there. -They're not going anywhere. -You got it. MANNY: But that was over two hours ago, why didn't he radio back? Obviously, there's something wrong with his radio. You've heard the way it cut out, and if he isn't answering our transmit, then... And what does he mean, "They weren't cooperating"? They're a couple of teenagers, in love. Well, they think they are. What would you do? I don't want to hear that anymore, my Ona does not love your son. Oh, what is the matter with my son? I would know and apparently, you would not because you never see him. Alex knows that my work takes me away for periods of time. He knows it and he understands it, accepts it. Did you ever ask him about it? I don't think that's any of your business. All I know is that there is something very deeply wrong with your son. My Ona was not the jungle's number one car thief until he showed up. Well, my son is not coverable for your daughter's actions. And he certainly didn't kidnap her. I just don't want any screaming anymore. Well, good. Fine, don't scream then. Listen, I just don't want to scream anymore. I don't want you to scream. I don't want to scream. I just want to hear Jimi Hendrix play the national anthem. -Good. -Like he did at Woodstock. You remember that? It was metaphysical. -[SCATTING] -[TURNS ON RADIO] And he did overtones. They were overtones. Whoo! [DOGS BARKING] I don't believe our luck. Look, they have a... -Shh, Alex, I'd be quiet, if I were you. -Why? The Atacamians are the fiercest, most violent race in the world. Uh, how bad can they be if they watch TV? ONA: The last anthropologist to study them, was found dead, with his sexual organs stuck down his throat. ALEX: At least they have a monitor. [SPEAKING SPANISH] He says it hasn't worked in twenty years. In that time, many warriors tried to fix it but each one failed. They were all punished for their bragging. Can they still have kids? -I didn't ask. -Don't. I'd rather not know. Are you sure you want to go through with this? [SIGHS] Our parents' lives depend on him. BILLY: Hello, my friend. -One more step and the game is over. -[CHIEF LAUGHING] Enter and you've won. Congratulations. -What does that mean? -The valley of the moon. [CHIEF SPEAKING SPANISH] [CHUCKLES] He said he'll show us how to get there. But he wants you to fix his TV first, so he can watch a show. No prob, Chief. [TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] [SIGHS] WOMAN: [ON TV] Hey, this is fun. -What's wrong? -They've already seen it. [BOTH LAUGHING] We better start thinking, Frank. We've got less than 36 hours and we have no idea where those little bastards are. None of our scouts have seen them. Damn it! Valerie's incommunicado. I can practically feel the Frenchman's gun up my nose. We should have killed them when we had the chance, but, no. Dumb head had to give him a smoke, oldest trick in the books. [CHUCKLES] So for once, for once you're right, all right? Well, I at least won't make that mistake again. So this is the train that will take us to Via de la Luna? No, Valle de la Luna. Gracias,pal. Yes, thanks for saving our lives. -Adios. -Adios. [PHONE RINGING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Sierra Gorda? Are you out of your mind? We're in Sierra Gorda. [HORN HONKING] Look, they found us again. Yeah. -Jesus, those guys don't give up. -What do we do now? Follow me. [ROOSTER CLUCKING] Yeah. Yeah, get over there. Yeah! [CHUCKLES] Get over there, come on. Get in. -[SCREAMS] -Go! You can run but you can't hide. I'll get you! Ouch! Damn it! [GRUNTS] Don't let them get away. Catch them. -Hide there. -Where? End of the line. [PANTING] [FRANK CHEERING] I'll be home. Shoot him. Now... [CHUCKLES] Give me that map. -Aren't you getting a little sick of that line? -No. No more jokes, huh? Game's over, Alex. To my pocket and... Take it out of your pocket! Come on. -Can I go now? -Yeah. You can go. You can go to hell. -[GROANS] -[ONA GRUNTS] -[LAUGHING] -TALBOT: Stop it! [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOTS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [GUN FIRES] [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Ona go bye-bye. That's it. You lose. -[GUNSHOTS] -Ah! [FRANK LAUGHING] -Did you get it? -[LAUGHS] -Let's get the hell out of here. -Okay. ONA: Alex! Oh... Alex? Victory. End of the game. Valle de la Luna. Right here is where crazy Billy hid our treasure. -Let's get it. -I'll be home soon. [CHEERING] Let's get the hell out of here. Come on! Yeah! [FRANK CONTINUES CHEERING] Hey, watch where you're going. Watch it! To the left! Stop! Hit the break! For crying out loud, you want to kill us? [GROANING] How did you do that? The Rolex, water proof, shock proof, bad guy proof. There is no substitute. [LAUGHS] FRANK: How about the girl? What if she goes to the cop? TALBOT: She's dead. Don't worry, Frank. The local police are taken care of. By the time anybody else finds out, we'll be history. The important thing right now is to contact MonsieurGei. Frank? Frank? It's all over by tomorrow. No more struggling for scientific discovery. No more worries about publication. [LAUGHS] No more reading the New England Journal of Medicine. $5 million. -I can taste it. -Remember, 500 is mine. [BOTH LAUGHING] Damn lighter! -Did you get it? -They're on a train. They're headed for Tocopilla. -Where? -Tocopilla. And after we got on the train, we thought we lost them but then, they found us again. And Victor tried to shoot us but Ona threw tomatoes in his face. Now slow down, Alex, if I understand you correctly, Dr. Victor Talbot, a world renowned pharmacologist is trying to kill you -for a treasure map, is that what you're saying? -In a nutshell, yes. And he kidnapped Manny and me but he didn't really kidnap us, is that right? I don't understand that part of it but what I'm saying is the truth. And what's the truth about this? This, next thing, you know, you'll be saying a bullet did it. Exactly, the watch stopped the bullet. Oh, Alex. I thought you were through with this kleptomaniacy. Five years in therapy and for what? Well, maybe if you'd been around more and you hadn't sent me off to boarding school, I wouldn't have been stealing things to get attention. So you admit you took the watch? Yes, Mom, I took the God damn watch. -But, Mom... -And the two jeeps? Yes! But, Mom, you've got to believe me. Those guys are killers. Ruthless killers. And they'll be coming through here any minute. And if there was such a sense of urgency, why were you necking with Ona, when I got here? See? At least you admit to stealing, that's one step in the right direction. That's all you care about, the things that have eight legs. Oh, that's... That's ridiculous. ALEX: Yeah, yeah, spiders and that phony-baloney fiance, who only wants you because of all the money he can make off your work. And you only want him 'cause he funds all your research and he doesn't care if you're around or not. Alex, you're right. You're right, I should have been around more. I should have been around more because I love you so much. And I should have been around, to teach you some more discipline. -Don't worry. -Ona. Ona? Ona, you come back. Don't worry, I'm going to make up for lost times, starting right now. And to think I only came down here, so we can get to know each other better. Because your hubby said I should. Good seeing you, Mom. Thanks for remembering my birthday. I'm saving you from yourself. Now, get in there. Your boyfriend's not going anywhere, neither you. -Maybe there's dust in the carburetor. -I already checked it. I thought you were going to watch the kids. [SIGHS] The kids are fast asleep and I don't need to be told what to do. Sorry. I guess, I haven't been very nice, have I? Well, I haven't exactly been a picture of a mellow man. I guess, being an... [VOICE BREAKS] ...being an entomologist hasn't really left me much time to be a human being. Or a mother. Well... Being a hippie, square hermit, I sometimes forget how to deal with other people, too. [INAUDIBLE] Are you sure we're doing the right thing? -Ona? Ona. -Alex? -Ona. -Alex? -Ona. -Alex? -Ona? -Alex. Ona. Ona! -If you think I... -Alex! Ona? Ona, no, please. Quit playing around, Ona. I... I said some things I'm a little sorry about but... I know you're here. Come out. [MOUTHING] [MANNY GROANING] Ona. Ona. You did that on purpose. Ona? [HUMMING] I'm sure she did it on purpose, she broke my foot on purpose. -Oh, it was only your pinkie. [HUMMING] -Ow! What are we going to do now? I can't second run the marathon. We're going to fix the jeep and go to the police. Might we suggest something else? Victor? ALEX: So it's just like the picture on Olga Volga's disk. That's the valley of the moon. Blue rocks. No, this is Lapis Lazuli. What's that? It's like your turquoise but it means we're in the right place. -[EXHALES SHARPLY] -[SCREAMS] Careful. Look! I'm almost afraid to open it. Alex, I have to admit something to you. I'm a bad kisser, I knew it. Mary Margaret Simkins told me so. No, you're a wonderful kisser. I wasn't going to let you keep your half of the treasure. I was going to give it all to the Indians. It belongs to them, not to us. -[SIGHS] You're serious? -Yeah. Except, now I don't know anymore. We've been through too much. I like you too much. Well, we can give it to the Indians. We can give it to a museum. I don't care. All I wanted to do was find it. Finding it with you, that was the icing on the cake. -First we have to find it. [CHUCKLES] -Right. Is this what I think it is? I think it's cocaine. We're in some deep major shit. -[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] -[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Get in there. VALERIE: Alex? Alex? Alex? Alex? -I thought you killed them. -So did I. -Ona, did you have to drop a truck on my foot? -I'm sorry. -A hammer maybe, but a truck? -I'm so sorry I didn't believe you. -Are you all right. -I'm okay. Mike! Michael. Oh, mon cheri. It is too bad you had to involve yourself directly in this transaction. Why are you talking like that? In my business, it is helpful to have many identities. No one suspected the research station was actually a cocaine facility. -Oh, my god. -Not with you there. For the past year, you've served my organization well, as its most innocent and most attractive cover. You slimy pig! It is a pity I have to lose you but you're a bit old for me. And as for you... And as for you, you annoying piece of merde, I don't like people getting the better of me. Enough nonsense! -Victor? Take care of them. -Mmm-hmm? Okay. All except for that one. -You're not taking my daughter. -Bring her along. [TIRES SCREECHING] Oh, Valerie, before I forget, the crimson toed tarantula has been extinct for over 500 years. I cooked up the entire project to keep you on the facility while we were conducting business. Extinct? Really? Yep, I'm afraid so. It's questionable, whether or not it ever existed. A spider with red toes? Causing sleeping death? [CHUCKLES] Come on. -[CHUCKLES] -Sounds like a cheap horror movie. I have to admit, it sounds ridiculous. But I really enjoyed working with you, though. -No hard feelings? -No more than it would be normal. Shake? Victor, would you like this jacket? I don't think I'll be needing it where I'm going. -Why, Valerie, you're so generous. -Come on. That's the last present I get you. I don't expect you to trust me. All right. This is okay. Thanks a lot. [SINGING IN GERMAN] When I say go, run! [YAWNING] Take a nap. -[SNORING] -Doc, what's the matter? What's the matter, doc? Ouch! -VALERIE: Run, Alex. Run. -[BOTH SNORING] We've got trouble, boss. GEIGER: Take off. PILOT: But... GEIGER: I said take off! Fasten your seatbelt, baby. It's going to be a bumpy ride. VALERIE: Alex, you're too late. Alex, stop. Alex, Alex! Alex. Alex! Alex! Alex! Why have a boy when you can have a man? I like a girl with spit. Or was that spirit? Rêves bons, mon père. It's "Bons rêves", merdeface. I looked it up. Alex? Alex? Alex? Hey! [SCREAMING] -What are you doing? -I can throw it all off before you can kill me. Don't! What do you want? Untie her. No. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. Now, you're going out there, you bloody kid. [YELLS] That was for the kids of America. [SIREN WAILING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] [TALBOT SNORING] MAN: Well, we're here to extend the gratitude of the President and the Ambassador and the people of the United States. Senor,they've got it all wrong. My name is Miguel Guerrero. I am a citizen of Paraguay. [SNORING] [SNORING] Congratulations, each and every one of you. You are a credit to your nation. And the Ambassador has invited you to attend a special dinner party he's planned in your honor. Oh, I don't think so. My son and I have to catch a plane and we have a lot of catching up to do. The Ambassador does not take no for an answer. Well, then, we'll tell him yes and we just won't show up. -[LAUGHS] -Oh, oh! Gracias. Gracias. You're going to come and visit like we've planned, right? -Sure, if I can. -Promise me. Okay, I promise. -Well, I have to go now. -I know. [VALERIE SPEAKING SPANISH] Alex? [CHUCKLES] Forget them. Alex? Alex? Alex? -What are you doing? -Oh, I don't know. I just, sort of, spaced. It must have been some kind of chemical reaction. It is your own virus. Don't do it again, unless... Can you stay a few more weeks and work on that spider venom? It's number two on my list, remember? -Alex is the number one priority. -I understand. -Alex? -Oh, just give him another minute, all right? My mother gave these to me. They come from the area where her people used to live. They've been in her family for generations. I want you to have one. -Beautiful. -Which one do you want? This one. Look, blue diamonds. They must have been in the necklace all these years. Told you, I was a klutz. Where did you say her tribe came from? It's pretty far from here. VALERIE: Alex? Alex, hurry, the plane is leaving. MANNY: Alex! Oh, no, not again. Oh. How long is this going to go on?
