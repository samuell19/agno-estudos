LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD AND TOM THUMB VS. THE MONSTERS Among the worlds that coexist... ...within the portentous work of creation... ...encrusted in the immensity of the universe... ...this planet spins untiringly... ...full of hopes and dreams... ...where fantasy seems to become reality... ...here and there... ...in the sea... ...in forests... ...in eternal snow. On this planet there is good and evil... ...and in the Kingdom of Evil dwell all the storybook... ...witches and monsters that we have met in fables. Here, goodness and virtue... ...are the highest of treasons... ...and are the motive of trials... ...and punishment. Soon, soon, soon... ...come all. Everybody, come. Vengeance we must take... ...both of them are going to pay. Little Red Riding Hood and Tom Thumb. They turned the wolf good. They overtook the Ogre between the two. Little Red Riding Hood and Tom Thumb. We hate school, and because we don't go... ...we have to live with monsters who lay low. Those who disobey their mothers will burn. Into witches they will turn... ...and on a broom they shall churn. And whoever misbehaves... ...will have to help with might... ...care for the kingdom in spite... ...and fight. The enemies... ...of the Kingdom of Evil must die. Oh queen, may your evil instill... ...these two children of kindness and will. Little Red Riding Hood and Tom Thumb. The Ogre and Wolf are on trial... ...because they dared change their bile... ...and now they are mild... ...and well behaved and not only for a while. They have also betrayed... ...our Kingdom of Evil. They must die, they must die. They must die... ...they must die. Silence, I am going to read... ...to the "dishonorable" jury. - Child Snatcher. - Here. As always, kidnapping disobedient children... ...to carry away in my sack. Our friend "Frankenstino". Here. "Boogie Man". As usual, dancing away. Man and Beast, better known in our kingdom... ...as "Two for One". Always on active duty. Don't growl. Her gracious highness "Dummy Witch" and sister... ...of our royal highness "The Queen of Evil"... ...heiress of the throne. All yours, mister Vampire. Lucifer forbid. Her highness the queen, Snow White's stepmother. She went to the bathroom, sir. Well, she has a right. "Hurricane Dwarf". Here. Enough! Stop blowing! You blower! Her majesty "The Queen Witch". Her perverse majesty is here. Queen Witch, ruler of the Kingdom of Evil. Save ye, oh Queen Witch! What're the charges against Wolf and Ogre? You name them, Your Majesty. First of all... ...the so-called Big Bad Wolf... ...far from eating Little Red Riding Hood, which is his duty... ...betrayed our brotherhood... ...and befriended the virtuous girl. In regard to the Ogre... ...he became tame and cowardly... ...and instead of eating Tom Thumb and his siblings... ...he started eating spinach... ...vanilla ice cream... ...and popcorn. That hypocrite is lying. And it is also a lie that so-called Big Bad Wolf... ...along with the stinky Skunk... ...were with Little Red Riding Hood singing and dancing... ...in the countryside and in the forest. How do the accused plead? - I object. - So do I. Speak, "objectants". We object against that Vampire's hateful tongue. What's wrong with his tongue? Oh, hardly anything. He has a "vipertine" tongue. I mean, viperine. - Right, Mr. Ogre? - Of course. He's just out to get us. He accuses us of tiny, insignificant sins... ...and doesn't notice his own great big ones. Ask that wimpy Vampire why he's so skinny. I, I will tell you, Mr. Ogre. He's skinny... ...because he bit the Witch. Quiet, insect. Well, as I was saying... ...the Witch bit us all. The poor Vampire has nobody left to bite. Enough nonsense. There he is, my loyal little squire. Stop whispering. What is the jury's verdict? Innocuous, I mean, innocent. Guilty. No! Innocent! Innocent. In view of your high treason... ...I sentence you to die... ...by being cut in half... ...with a saw. With a saw. With a saw! You are too cruel, Mrs. Witch, you cannot do that to me. You make me so mad sometimes, and with my ulcer. Silence! Your Majesty... ...we humbly... ...ask that hateful Little Red Riding Hood and Tom Thumb... ...to be punished for their mischief, too. I sentence those children and all the village dwellers... ...to be put under a spell by my evil power! I'll turn them into gross mice and ridiculous monkeys. I must save my master. I'm flying, I'm flying. May the sentence be executed... ...and the traitors die the worst of deaths... ...when the full moon rises... ...and the wicked owl chirps three times. Chirp once! No, that's cheating. It's not fair. It's not! Tom Thumb. Tom Thumb. Tom, don't be mischievous. Tom Thumb! Tom Thumb! Tom Thumb. Tom Thumb... Where are you, Tom Thumb? I can't find you. Look carefully, Red Riding Hood, if you want to find me. You love games, but I shall seek for your kind... ...and with the help of my dog I know I will find. Don't forget, Little Red Riding Hood, that I am tiny. You won't find with a magnifying glass my hiney. We must go to school, it is no longer time for play. Come out, Tom Thumb, if you misbehave you will have to pay. Look for him, Titan, he must be close by. In a hurry, if we scurry... ...we will find him, low or high. Start looking, I can tell you have all day... ...you poor dumb dog, you will never find me, if you may. Let us be as two good friends and don't make me mad. Tom Thumb, if you behave better we can play and be glad. Tom Thumb. Tom Thumb. Look carefully, Red Riding Hood, if you want to find me. It's not that easy to hide from Titan. He can find anything with the size of that snout. Go on, go on, you menace. You're a big menace! Come on, Doncel, let's go. A curve! Where are you going? Dummy! What's wrong, Skunk? Wild Queen caught Witch Ogre. Wolf Queen caught Wild Witch. Calm down, Skunky, we don't understand a word. The monsters got Big Bad Wolf and Mr. Ogre... ...and sentenced them to death for being good. My God! Plus, the Queen will put a spell on the river... ...and turn everyone into mice and monkeys. Everyone! Let's go save them. Hold Tom Thumb, don't drop him. If you do, don't step on him. Come on, come. I will haunt the water the villagers use. Little Red and Tom Thumb... ...will get what they deserve. Dummy... ...go watch the villagers. It will be fun seeing them... ...become funny little animals. You must report immediately. Heavens, these children are so "hyper". Tom Thumb is late, it's almost time to eat. - Oh my! - I'll go look for him, mom. Go to the Singing River to fetch some water. We're going to the river! Come on, let's go! Abracadabra, dabra, dabra, dabra, cadabra! With my magic powers... ...everything will be transformed. - What was that? - Must be the Queen Witch. Look, there she is. Vengeance! Vengeance! So that everybody is thirsty... ...and nobody escapes... ...make the weather hot. Very hot. - Good afternoon, Father. - Likewise, child. Only the devil would find such scorching heat good. Don't blaspheme. I'd never... ...felt such unbearable heat. My girl went to visit Granny. She must be playing in the forest. Let's freshen up, Father. Give us some water, good woman. Is it fresh? Yes, I fetched it from the Singing River. Thank you so much, Mr. Patriarch, after you. It is delicious! Oh, such terrible heat! Mother! Little siblings! The enchanted water. The Queen Witch kept her threat... ...of turning them into mice. I'll fetch my slingshot... ...to get that wicked witch. Let's go to my place, let's see if we're on time. Yes, yes, yes. Let's go! Wait up, I'm going with you! As soon as I feed my mother and my siblings. Wow, it was hungry! Let's go! My God, the monkeys! The Witch will finish us off! Let's visit the Queen Witch... ...and ask her not to be so evil. What? She will turn us... ...into worms, or dust. - There is another way. - What? The Morning Fairy, they say she's wonderful. - The Morning Fairy? - Yes. She lives over there, far into the horizon. There's no time to waste. Let's go! So you're going to look for... ...that busy-body Morning Fairy. You're going to get it when my sister hears. You are going to be sick. Mother. Mommy! The Queen Witch is worse than a demon! And that must be your Granny. They drank from the river, what shall we do? Wolf and Ogre are in jail. That's right, there is nobody to help us. Oh, I am dying of thirst! I can't stand it. Careful Skunk, you'll turn into a monkey! Oh my, I almost did it! You saved me, Red Riding Hood. Mr. Patriarch! Let's all go! You have the nicest granny in the world. Just a minute. Bye Mom, see you Granny, excuse me, Mr. Patriarch. We'll ask the Morning Fairy... ...to undo the spell. In case you get hungry, there are peanuts in the kitchen. Finally, let's go. We have to flee, Mr. Ogre... ...before the Queen Witch cuts us in half. But how? I don't think we stand a chance... ...with these balls and chains. It's unbelievable, so big yet so stupid. Don't call me stupid. I don't think you've proven to have... ...a glimpse of talent. What are you bragging about? I'm the smart one here. Yes, sir! Yeah sure, that's why you're here, all cozied up. I was caught off guard and from behind. That's different. As soon as Skunky gets here... ...they'll see what I'm made of. And, to sweeten up your mouth... ...we will get out... ...free... ...both of us. How about that? Stop bragging about being so courageous and brave. Right now you are as scared as a mouse in a cave. You are an ugly wolf-guy... ...who is not bad but shy... ...and not even a bit sly. You are the coward, you feel so alone... ...and truth is, death scares you to the bone. Ha, ha, ha, ha, mother. That is hilarious, father. His snarl makes you sigh, but he cannot lie... ...for he shall soon die. They caught me off guard and in treason... ...but for your situation I see no reason. You've eaten so many children in hearty meals... ...but got scared of monsters, that's a whole different deal... ...and lost your appetite, so how does that feel? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha... ...you forgot to say rah, rah rah... ...because when I die... ...with your skull at my side... ...in my tomb I will lie. Oh no, no, no... ...don't die, please don't go. - [I'm young. - [I'm a youngster. We deserve to live on... Oh, no, no, no. We have to flee from our foe. - [With my smarts... - [And with my experience... ...we will get away. We have to leave here today. Quiet, you miserable beings! Hey, Mr. "what's your face"... ...don't people get fed here? Don't you dare call me that. We are "Two in One". We're Siamese twins... ...joined at our backs. Siamese? You don't look like cats to me. Siamese twins. He's "Pretty" and I'm "Handsome". Right? Shut up! My ulcer is killing me! What's the point of eating? Soon the wicked owl will chirp... ...its second song of death. And you want some dinner. Anyhow... I'll see what can be done. Right? Here comes Boogie! The Boogie Man. - Oh, heavens! - Oh, heavens! This place is full of horrible people. It isn't true, it isn't true, it isn't true. - No! - I'm dreaming! We are not dreaming! It's baked pheasant, and all for us. We have to thank that man, "Too Darn Worn". - What? - "Two in One". Thank you, thank you so much, my dear "Two Times Three". You too, Mr. "Boogie Woogie". Thanks a lot. Pass the tray. We're starving. Who said this banquet is for you?! It's not? Who's it for, then? Who else could it be for? It's for us. Damnation, they starve you to death at this place! Don't you worry, we are going to let you... ...watch us eat from here! - Don't be dumb! - Sorry. To show our compassion... Give them a good ration. Boogie Man. Is this all? Only this? Show some respect, Mr. Ogre! They gave it to me! No, it's for both! No, no, no, no, it's such a ridiculous ration... ...that I might as well eat it all by myself. Oh, no, no, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes! No, no! Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no! You hit me from behind. - I did not. - You'll see! Where is the ball? This is what I was looking for. You'll see! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes! If they die we'll lose the reward. - Open up. - No, no, one more! - No, no, no! - Yes, one more, one more! No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no, no! - Yes, yes, yes. - No, no, no, no, no! Run, Tom Thumb, don't lag behind! Come on! Wait up, I'm coming with you. Look, here comes the Fairy. Yes, it's the Morning Fairy. She's so beautiful! Friends, I know you're tired from walking. I know your woes, but... ...unfortunately, I can do nothing to help you. Why not, beautiful mistress? My magic powers end where the Kingdom of Evil begins. The Queen Witch cast a spell... ...on all the villagers. They'll kill Wolf and Ogre, who are good now. That's true, but unfortunately... ...the Queen Witch has us under her control. What to do, beautiful lady? I always help those who are clean of heart... ...but you will have to overcome the dangers... ...of the Kingdom of Evil and rescue the magic filter... ...that the Queen Witch keeps in her castle. Come close. My magic wand will spare you... ...from hunger, thirst and cold. Thank you, great lady. It is time to go, may God be with you. I want to go with them, too. Wait for me! No, Tom Thumb, you are much too tiny to follow them. Mrs. Fairy, can't you make me grow to be... ...the same size as my friends? I will grant you that grace. Grow, Tom Thumb, grow, for your courage will bestow. I'm big! I'm big! The biggest in the world! Thank you! Thank you so much, great lady! Wait for me! I'm going with you! Wait for me! The heat is unbearable. What did you say? I said that 5,000 demons... ...are unbearable, that there... ...should be 30 or 40 thousand. I was just saying... ...that I'm hungry. You mean you're still hungry? Not really, how about you? Well... ...I'm not either. Not bad... ...right, Mr. Ogre? Of course not, Super Wolf. How about us taking a sniff? That's not a bad idea at all. Wait. How about if I go first? Why don't we both go at the same time? How about if... if we cut it in two? In two equal parts. That's better, that way... ...we'll avoid a duel to death. Defend yourself. This one's mine. The bone. The bone! The bone. Too bad! Well, you didn't want it anyway, did you Mr. Ogre? Now I feel strong enough to make our escape. Good. We're together now, and united we're stronger. All we need now is the... ...key to this gate. - Yes, hardly anything. If I only had my "7 Leagues" boots... ...or if Tom Thumb were here... ...he's smart, he'd help us out. So what? If my loyal Skunk were here... ...neither you or I would be prisoners. If my aunt had wheels... We must do something. We need a bright idea. Yes, yes, yes... Yes, yes. - I got it! - The idea? Yes, a "brought" idea. Let's hear it. - I forgot. - The brought idea! - Yes. - Brought. They're pulling my leg. Did you say leg? Yes. Leg. So, you're making fun of me... ...because my legs are short. Listen to me, Mr. Ogre... ...I just thought of the "brought" idea that we need. Have you ever heard of... ...Panfleta? Abracadabra, dabra, dabra... Dabra, dabra, dabra... ...the events in my kingdom... ...I will see in the ball. The border of the kingdom. This is so ugly, Tom Thumb. I'm not scared because now... ...I'm the biggest man of all. Stop bragging, kid! I can't wait to have it out with the witch. Oh, heavens! This is so ugly, it's haunted. We've got to get out of here. - Hold on. - Give me your hand. You too, Little Red, your paw... Not you, Doncel. Oooh, yucky! It's those insufferable brats. And that stinky Skunk. They'll see what awaits them. Nobody has gotten out alive. Satan! My lord and master. Come up. It's important! Could it be the wrong path? No, I know this path... ...like the palm of my paw. No, I never make mistakes. Don't lag behind. Attention, tree of 1,000 voices. Attention. Calling all monsters. Calling all monsters. Little Red Riding Hood, Tom Thumb and Skunk... ...in company of a dog, have dared invade us. They must be stopped! Finish them off. Attention, calling all of my monsters. Beware, beware. Attention, calling all of my monsters! This is so ugly, so ugly! It's darker than a black ant! - Did you hear that? - Mother! Yes, it must be the wind. Don't be scared, I'm here to defend you. Such nonsense, this is the Kingdom of Evil. We could fall into the Queen Witch's claws. We have to find Mr. Ogre and Big Bad Wolf... ...for them to help us get the magic filter. Go on, chicken! Gallant, you mean. Women and children first. Then you go first, I'm bigger than you. Look, here comes a mop! Dummy, what took you so long? Little Red, Tom Thumb and Skunk went to see... ...our enemy, the despicable Morning Fairy. I know. They dared challenge me. They won't get my filter... ...to undo the spell I cast. They are so naive. They know not that right now... ...they are about to be destroyed. Am I on the right path? We're doing fine. Come, we don't want the witch to catch us. - I'm stuck. - You're pulling my leg. Now we've got to get it out. Not like that, no. Hurry up. No, not like that. Watch out! Hurry, the Martian is coming. Hurry! Come on, quick. Hurry! I can't stand it, I'm gonna get him! I got him right where it hurts! He's burning, he's burning! Hurrah, hurrah! I proved I don't hold a grudge because you... ...called me stupid, and I also proved... ...that you can't confront my strength. You don't say, you don't say. You want to bet I'm more of a man than you? Really? - I'll prove it right now. - Really? How? Come here. Look... ...like this. Like this. Laughing at the pain... ...see. See! Oh, my! Are you crazy? You put your own life in danger. To me, life is worthless. But you really are hurt. There's no doubt. But, as badly wounded as I may be... ...my manly dignity comes first. On the other hand, after just a few blows... ...you're whining, you old cowardly Ogre. I'll teach you I'm no cowardly Ogre... ...you scabby she-wolf. - How's that? - Oh, my! You are still very swollen, Mr. Ogre. You look like a rhinoceros. Two in One... ...you know something? - What? I can't stand these nerves any longer. Oh, you little rascal. I get it, you can't wait... ...to execute the prisoners and collect the reward. Yes, I can't wait any longer. I feel the same way, but there are four more days to go... ...until there's full moon. That's the problem. Listen... ...why don't we move up the date? - No! Don't be a fool. Disobeying the Queen Witch would mean... Don't walk so far ahead, Tom. There are many dangers here. I said I'm not scared. I'm bigger than a giant. Tom Thumb is brave, isn't he? Yes, but we shouldn't confuse... ...courage with carelessness. And, kids should always respect their elders. Hey! Do you see... ...what I see?! Oh, a monster. Another mop! Another mop! Stick your hand out to turn... ...or else he will catch you! Oh, mother! Let go! Let go! Tom Thumb... Tom Thumb... Where can Tom Thumb be? Did he get lost? Tom Thumb... Tom Thumb! Let me go! Let me go, you old pig! - Hairy thing! - Get over here. Help me, dear mother! Let me go! Let me go! Now let's go this way. It's this way, Red Riding Hood. Hold my hand, don't let go. I think he found a trace. They'll catch us! - Who is it, who is it! - You little rascals! Don't let that beast beat you. Stupid Child Snatcher! We've escaped, Red Riding Hood. The ugly old man's over there. Now it's my turn, you old pig. Aim! Fire! I'm dying! Oh, mother! That poor Child Snatcher, you made him blind. He's just a cry baby, Little Red Riding Hood. Let's tie him. Quick, hurry! Let's see, give me your arm. Come on, come on! Stop pushing. Stop it, I said. Stop pushing and groaning! Stay still! Rocka-by baby! Help! Help! It's Tom Thumb. He's around here somewhere. Help! Little Red Riding Hood! Little Red Riding Hood! Skunky! Oh, Tom Thumb, what... Another child? Dozens... Little Red Riding Hood. Millions, there are millions of children. The Snatcher got me from behind, the cheater. How many had he snatched? Kids who yell at their folks. Thanks for saving us. We won't misbehave. The Child Snatcher... ...let's get rid of him. Get him, get him! That mean Child Snatcher! - I'll use this to... - Just a minute! Let's use him as a [pinata. He won't get away, he won't. One... ...two, and... ...four. Well, I'll be! I'm surrounded my morons! It smells worse than me! Okay, get ready to pull... ...and you, stop pushing me, stop pushing me. Pull, pull! One, two, four, five, eight... Hurrah for the [pinata]! We've punished him enough. Now, go back home. We'd like to stay with you. No way, you'd be in danger. Go away now, we have to go to the castle. Go home! Well, let's go home, you guys. Let's! Don't leave me here! You'll be hanging there til Christmas Eve! You let yourself be caught. How disgraceful, sister, how disgraceful. How stupid, you mean. It is clear to me that the Morning Fairy... ...is playing dirty. - What? Can't you see, Dummy? That fairy is protecting the rascals. They'll see when I'm done... ...making this mortal potion. Heal in time, you will be fine. Not now. Let's see. Heal in time, you will be fine. I'm so glad that the swelling is going down. See, Mr. Ogre? All it took was some "heal in time". I am going to hasten Wolf and Ogre's death. Satan... ...master of darkness, come to my aid. Everybody has failed me. May there be a Full Moon now... ...and may your wicked owl chirp its deadly song. That evil owl has chirped for the third time. No, that's impossible! It isn't fair that we should die so young. - Especially me. - What about me? But we won't die, because our salvation is here. Yeah, there's something fishy going on. The owl wasn't supposed to chirp yet. Who cares! The time has come to collect the reward. Goody, goody! We will finally be rich, incredibly rich! What's wrong? You don't count, even if you're my brother! Stupid! I'm taking you to the scaffold right now! But be careful with those bad guys. All right... ...let's get started. - Is it clear? - It's clear. Careful, they're coming for us. Ready. Good-bye, unfortunate friend. What will become of you, left all alone? More importantly, Mr. Ogre, what will become... ...of Mrs. Panfleta's millions? Who will administer them? - Millions, you say? - Yes, millions and millions. Mrs. Panfleta is the richest person alive. What's going on here? Who is that Panfleta? Mrs. Panfleta is an extremely intelligent flea. Oh, a little flea. A millionaire trained flea. Mrs. Panfleta, say hi to him. What did she say? What? She said she's pleased to meet you, Mr. Bugger Man. Are you certain Panfleta is a millionaire? You couldn't count her money over the days... ...you have left to live. I only regret she will be left alone in the world... ...with all her money now that I am going to die. Calm down, Mr. Wolf, calm down. Unfortunately, there is no changing this. Don't say that, poor little Panfleta. Uh, I'll take care of her and her money. I want to meet her. Come in, Mr. Cocol, make yourself at home. Where is Mrs. Panfleta and all her millions? Mr. Wolf, give her to him. Allow me, Mrs. Panfleta. You will be in very good hands, dear friend. Treat her like your own child. Care for her. Look, poor thing. Here. Here are her millions. Go, hurry! What! Oh shucks, no wonder I didn't see my aunt! Huh! No, this is not my aunt, she swallowed a Christian. - She could be your sister. - Huh! Show some respect, Mr. Ogre! We better run if we want to save our skin! They will not escape! They will not escape! Attention, Hurricane Dwarf! Attention, Hurricane Dwarf! Stop them! Stop them! Look! The Hurricane Dwarf. Let's get the fatso. Ops, it's strong! Oh, man! How hard! Careful, Mr. Ogre! Careful! - Careful! - Here come more. Let's attack! Come on, Mr. Ogre! Come on! Come on! One more. Come on, come on! I think we're here! Yes, yes! It's the signal of the gate... ...to the mysterious hallway. Let's go, all together! All together now! Oh my, it's so ugly! A monster's skeleton. How about that? Let's go! Run feet, run! Run feet, run! Here he comes! Run. Well done, Tom, this monster... ...won't cause anymore trouble. Off to better things! I hope we can save them! Yes, that's right, let's go! They will pay dearly for... ...that trick they played on me over Panfleta. - Won't they? - Naturally. It will be a pleasure to cut them to pieces... ...for us to get our reward. We'll put them to sleep or kill them awake. We'll let them choose. Gentlemen, your final will? You can tell the Queen Witch to go and... Nobody had insulted me so! Boogie Man... ...Two in One... ...put those rascals to death. But before they die... ...give them a taste of the worst torment. Make the famous inquisitor seem like an amateur. You heard. You heard it, Boogie Man. Let's obey the Queen's orders. Gladly. We shall begin with torment No. 3 as an appetizer... Will we get an appetizer? And snacks, too. You shall toast for Panfleta. No, dear mother, no! Please, no, no! No, no, no! Stop, no more! No more, no more! No more, no, please! Oh, dear mother! I'm not playing like that! No, no, please! No more, please! No more tickling? They are only a snack. Now, your appetizer. For you to keep moving like that old skull. Dig in! Don't waste it, don't waste it! Now this! My, my! Oh, my! Let go. Let me go. Well done, Doncel! Go on, Little Red Riding Hood, keep tickling! All right, show us what you've got, bully! Your handkerchief, Tom Thumb! Very good, Red Riding Hood. So you never do that again! And now... ...the tip... ...this monster will never do that again. It's horrible, this monster is getting up. Don't let him stand. Here, here. Oh, poor monster, I won't do that again. Let's go! Now I guess the gentlemen shall want... ...to be tickled a little more, right? Don't be nasty! Don't be nasty, come on! Insolent! You will get what you deserve. Get her going! No, no, no, no! No, please! No, no, no! I don't want to be two! How ugly. My saw is in perfect working order. So is mine. The Queen will be proud of me. When she sees an impeccable right angle cut. Mine will always be the best. What's that? Whatever you say, whatever. Aha! No, no, no! No, please! No, no, no! Oh, what is that? No, no, no, please! Look, there they are! They are such fatsoes. - Yes. - Step aside. Why do you hit from behind? - Me? - Yes, you. Liar. You did, you are so perfidious. Here, this is me. And this is me. Ready, Mr. Ogre, or else they'll give you crew cut. - Here we are, Wolfie. - Cheer up, Mr. Ogre. Let's stop the saw. The lever. Thank God we were on time. How do you feel, Wolfie? F-f-fine. B-b-bad. Mr. Ogre. Mr. Ogre, just look at you! Oh no, here he is alive. My feet, what have you done to my feet? But it is you, my loyal little squire. Come to my arms, my blessed little child. I knew... ...you wouldn't let me down. I never have, have I master? Never. - Is that you, Tom Thumb? - Yes, Mr. Ogre. But, how did you grow? Thanks to the Morning Fairy. Now I am bigger than you. Thanks, Tom. Thank you all. We owe you our lives. They parted me in half, what a dishonor. That witch will get what's coming to her. - Let's go! - Let's go! The one I hate the most... ...is my eternal enemy Little Red Riding Hood. You shall inherit this throne. You have to deserve it. Catch her. Bring her to me at once. Your will shall be done. Look, be careful! It tastes horrible. Little Red Riding Hood! She went that way. - That way. - This way. Let's go this way! Little Red Riding Hood! Little Red Riding Hood! Little Red Riding Hood! Little Red Riding Hood... You are so cute. Who are you, mistress? I am Dummy, the heiress of this kingdom. Come darling, my sister wants to meet you. I said come. Little Red Riding Hood! Little Red Riding Hood! - Red! - Where could she be? Come on, she can't be too far. - Look. - Look. - The hood. - The hood, the hood! I've been waiting for you. The pesty blood-sucker. Look straight at me. Back. Back. Careful, Mr. Ogre, the witch will bite you. Back. Back. Don't move. Don't you move. Bite that. I was pretending to be asleep. Look. Hey, watch what I'm gonna do. Here. To make sure you don't bite anyone again... ...I'll bite you. This isn't the way back. We are lost. Follow me. It's useless. Only Little Red and Tom Thumb could help us. Let's go! Here you go. Wait. No doubt about it, she's beautiful. So beautiful. And that's why I hate you. Yes. I hate you, you hideous being. Your punishment will be so... ...horrendous that nobody would ever imagine. Stop, all the villagers were... ...haunted by the Queen Witch... ...and there isn't anyone left. What should we do then, oh great mistress? Return immediately and help... ...Red and her friends, for they are in danger. How will we find them? We are lost in the forest. Follow this path. You'll come across a cave. There is a mysterious tunnel. But we are terribly scared. My wand will grant you the courage to face... ...all dangers, perseverance and gratitude. Evil will never prevail. Guys, grab sticks and stones. Let's finish off the Queen Witch. Let's go! It's unfair. She is nowhere to be found. This is terrible, I can't find Little Red Riding anywhere. All because she went first. Less talking, more action. A monster must have taken her. By this time she must be in the Queen Witch's power. Frankenstino. At your orders, Majesty. Frankenstino... ...my hateful enemies have invaded the castle. Let's teach them a lesson. Master, we could throw the Dragon of Avernus upon them. He will tear them to shreds. Great idea! Let him loose right away. I want to quench my thirst of vengeance. Your will shall be done. No mistress, don't kill them. Please. So, you don't want them to die. You know... ...your friends will face a frightful death... ...just as you will. No mistress, don't kill them. No, don't! It looks like a chimney. It is very hot. This is getting very ugly. - It smells like sulfide. - Yes. It smells horrible. Dragon, tear them to pieces! Oh my, this one is powerful! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! You'll see. Be careful. - Right on the head! - [Well done, Skunky! Oh mother, I was hit right on the spot! I am enjoying my vengeance. Yes, sister. One, two, three four... Up with the dragon, the dragon, hurrah! Hurrah, my little folk! Don't be scared, attack! But what do I see? I failed once more! Yes, sister. That dragon did not blow! Let's go! - That darn dragon. - We got rid of it! We owe this victory to you as well, children. Let's go get the Queen Witch! This is the filter you wanted... ...to undo the spell. It's beautiful isn't it? You will never have it. Don't be mean, Mrs. Witch. We never hurt you... ...in any way. Don't take our lives. Sorry... ...you fool. I don't know that word. But I know what torture and punishment are. And, you know... ...it's time you paid for your disrespect. Those eyes, which are the most beautiful... ...features you have on your abominable face... ...will never, ever see morning light again. With these nails... ...I will tear your eyes out. No, please! Tom Thumb, Mr. Ogre, Wolfie! Tom Thumb! - Mr. Ogre, Wolf. - Shouting is useless. Mr. Ogre, Skunky! Mr. Ogre! Mr. Ogre! Tom Thumb! Mr. Ogre! Wolfie! Over there. Yes, there. - Run, run. - Run. Run. Back, you scumbags. One step... ...and Red will be blinded. That cowardly hag. If you make one stupid move... ...I will thrust the filter... ...and everything will be over for you. My monsters should have... ...killed you, it would've been sweet compared... ...to the fate that awaits you. - You will go to hell. - Sister... Satan! What have you done, Dummy?! Give it! - No, no, no! - Give it! - Yes... - Give it! - Here you go. - Give it! Sure, I'd be glad to. - Give it to me, give it! - Here, here. Give it to me, you hairy Wolf! Give it. Here. - Give it to me, Skunk. - Here. - Changes hands. - Gone. Give it! All right, all right! Give it. Little Red Riding Hood, here. Bravo! You're not part of the team. Ready! One, two, three, four, tell me who do we adore! Look, look, look! This is making me sick! Skunk. But what have you done? Dumb... ...Dummy... ...dumbest. Stop! That filter is mine, you wouldn't keep... ...something that isn't yours. Back, you fools! Or I'll throw her in the fire. Give it to me, Little Red. If I return your filter, promise to undo the... ...spell and not harm us? - Of course, precious. - [Don't believe her, Red. Don't give it to her, don't. That witch is a liar. Give it! Straight to hell. Sister of mine! The witch bit her, we are free. Yippy! One minute of silence for the Queen Witch. Just a minute, so you thought I was dead. Not quite, buster. We must try this little witch. Don't bust me, I mean, kill me. I'm not as evil as you think. Who would believe that witch? Little Red Riding, tell them to forgive me. I'll turn into a good witch. She didn't do us any harm. Little Red Riding Hood is right. This witch... ...didn't hurt anyone. Oh yeah, sure, but we need proof of her... ...kindness. - [Yes. - I'll prove it right now. It's the first good deed of my new life. The filter. Abracadabra, dabra, dabra... ...cadabra, dabra, dabra... ...through your magic powers... ...all shall be transformed. We have to thrust this filter into hell's mouth. What happened? A fairy... A beautiful fairy. The Kingdom of Evil has been destroyed... ...and with it its monsters, its ghosts... ...and witches. Hurrah! Good, good, good! There's one over here, but... She repented and helped us undo the spell on the villages. Yes, and we will all be happy like before. There is only one thing left... ...and that is you. Why don't you wave your wand... ...to change her from a witch? Yes, yes, Morning Fairy, and if it isn't too much to ask... ...I'd like to be as pretty as you are. Now, I think that is too much to ask. You shall stop being a witch. Ugliness and beauty... ...good and evil, are only in our hearts. Only to the believer of your... ...goodness will you be good. I'm pretty. Hurrah, Tom Thumb! We are free now! Hurrah for Red Riding Hood! Hurrah, hurrah! Listen, it sounds like heavenly music. The village bells toll. And look, there isn't a cloud in the sky. It makes me feel like singing. And whistling. This is a wonderful day... ...Iook at the blue sky... ...the bells toll their melody... ...full of emotion. And with a little whistle... ...hearts jump for joy. Life always has a certain splendor... ...the world is full of light. Let us sing a hymn of love... ...to the hope of every new day. And with a little whistle... ...sweet and small... ...fill your heart... ...of joy. This is a wonderful day. THE END
