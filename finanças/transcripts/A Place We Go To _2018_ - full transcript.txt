(car door opening) (traffic passing) (car door closing) - [Woman] I just think they would want us to get married in a temple or something, not a Christian church. - Who does that nowadays? We're not in Tibet. Besides, our focus should be on finding you a husband. Double wedding. Remember? This is your bedroom, and the bathroom's down the hall. - Thanks. - Why do you have to get married at the same time? - My mom's wish. On her deathbed her exact words were, the two of you have to get married at the same time, a double wedding. - Wow. I guess I just don't really get that, like why would you wish that on your children? - [Woman] I don't know. - Is it a Buddhist thing? - [Woman] I don't think so. - So, why don't you have a boyfriend? - I guess I just haven't found the right one yet. - By the way, this George is a very nice guy. He has his own business. He travels all the time. No need to look any further. He's the one. - How do you know he's the one? - [Man] Like I said, he has his own business, he's a nice guy, and he travels all the time. - [Woman Guest] What does any of that have to do with anything? - I'm only trying to help. You told me you don't have anyone special. Would you slow down the drinking, and use a napkin please? - Yeah, I'm here. Did the Welch group confirm? - [Man On Phone] Yeah, it looks you got him. He'll get a hold of you when you get back. - Great. - [Man On Phone] I missed you. Do you want to know how much I missed you? - Tell me how much you missed me. - [Man On Phone] I'd like to stick my fingers inside you. - No fingers this time. Let's try something else. Let's say, I'm not wearing any clothes. - [Man On Phone] Are you standing or sitting? - I'm standing. I'm sitting. - [Man On Phone] On a chair? - On an office desk. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Man On Phone] I'm massaging your breasts until you get wet. - Okay, what else? - Then, I'm pushing inside as I'm on top of you. - How does it feel? - It's warm, and moist. - Okay, what else? - [Man On Phone] Now I'm in, all the way. (man sighing) (both sexual breathing) (door creaking) - [Man] What are you doing? - Don't you knock? What do you want? - I forgot to tell you, George called and moved the date to tomorrow night. - I just got here. - The sooner the better. Right? - Yeah, right. - Joan was 18 in this photo. - You married an 18-year-old? - No, that was a photo of her when I first met her. This was taken right before she died. Cancer, you know. - I'm sorry. She was very beautiful, in both photos. - She was. - Thanks for tonight. - Thank you. I had a nice time. (crickets chirping) (dog barking) (game on TV) - Here you are. - Thanks. (bar patrons talking) Yeah, I think so. Every 25-year-old has a girlfriend or boyfriend at this age. - My cousin's a pilot, and he's got a really cool 1990 King Air. - Hey. - Your Daniel's? - Sister. - Sister? - What, we don't look alike? - No. (laughing) - We're stepbrother and stepsister. - Came out for a casual drink, huh? - I just went on a blind date with someone. What about you? What are you doing here? - Well the truth is, my husband kept calling me and it was driving me crazy. Actually my ex-husband. So was it bad? - What? - Your blind date? - Not like so bad, but I don't know. He showed me photos of his late wife. - Oh. (chuckling) - All these blind dates, I'm exhausted. Not a single one has worked out. I feel like a piece of meat on the market. - Well, finding the right one takes time. - I just want to settle down. - Well you can't just settle with anybody, you have to settle with the right person. - Right. - Cheers. - Cheers. (jazz piano music) - Wanna play pool? - You do it. - You assume the stripes. (light jazz music) (bar patrons talking) - [Brother] Hey. - Old injury from soccer? - [Brother] Yeah. - You should take some pain killers. - It's okay, it'll go away. Sit with me. So, is George nice? - He is nice. - Is he the one? - I'm not sure. - I want you to pay attention to me now. All right? Sometimes the right one is right in front of you, to look any further would only make yourself confused. - Wow. - What? - Why are you talking to me like that? - Like what? - Like, I'm an old maid, or spinster, or something. - Well, that's where you're heading. - We're done here, goodnight. - Night. (doorbell ringing) (soft piano music) - So, what do you want to change? - I just want everything at an angle. Let's start with the table. (soft piano music) Let's do the couch. - [Sister] How do you want to move it? - Just not against the window. Just pile them. (grunting) - Maybe we should push it. - [Blonde] Yes. - Okay. - Let's push it. - Move this out a little bit. (louder piano music) This back. Yeah, this chair. Just like. Yeah. It looks good. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. You have a record player? - [Blonde] Yeah, do you listen to records much? - Never. Is this you? - [Blonde] Mm-hmm. - How old were you? - [Blonde] Like, 13. It was with my foster parents in South Africa. - Oh, thanks. - You want to try something stronger? - What do you mean? - I mean, you want to smoke a little weed? - Sure. - You ever smoke pot before? - No. (coughing) - [Blonde] You all right? - So strong. - It's not that bad. - So I was standing at a bus stop, with some other girls. We're like waiting for the school bus, this was back in Illinois. And there's this car driving by, like a shabby-looking Ford. And suddenly it parks right in front of us. And this boy gets out, he's like 18 years old. He comes toward me, and he looks at me, in like a funny sort of way. And then he pulls me close to him, and he sticks his tongue in my mouth, and I just panicked. And he laughed, and then got in his car and drove away. (laughing) - [Sister] People really do that? - Apparently. When was your first kiss? - I can't remember. - You can't remember your first kiss? - No. - Why not? - I don't know. What's wrong with that? - [Blonde] Don't tell me. - What? - You never kissed anyone before. - That's not true. I'm just saving it for the right person. - You're saving your kiss? - [Sister] Yeah, what's wrong with that? (dog barking on TV) (door opening) - Dong Hua. - Hey. - George called. He wants to get again tomorrow night. - Okay. - You already have plans or something? - No. (yelling on TV) (lawn mower running) (doorbell ringing) (light jazz music) (giggling) (light jazz music) - [Blonde] Had you been thinking about it? - [Dong Voiceover] Might have, more recently. - [Blonde] Was it what you expected, at all? - [Dong Voiceover] It was different. - [Blonde] Different how? - [Dong] Like, what was that? - So, you were surprised? (birds singing) (dramatic electronic music) - It's good. - You're really enjoying the food tonight. - I like food. (George chuckling) Describe someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. - Someone I can talk to, and just have a good time with. - Hmm. (dramatic electronic music) (muffled conversation) - This is your famous Mount Rushmore? - Yes. - Dearest Margaret. - Don't read it out loud. - Oh, sorry. Who's Margaret? - Me. - You? - It's my birth name, I changed it. - When'd you change it? - When Luke and I got married. - You can do that? - Of course. - Call me Margaret. - Margaret. - I like the sound of that. I think I should make it my name. What do you think? - Sure. This is the postcard you sent me back when we were dating. I was in Illinois. - Why were you in Illinois? - I grew up there. - Right. Why are you here? - Because of Luke, he's from South Dakota, and he proposed to me at Mount Rushmore. - He did? - Yeah. - How far is it from here? - What? - Mount Rushmore. - Five hours by drive. - Let's go see it. - I've seen it enough. - I've never seen it. I want to see it. - Then go by yourself. - No, I want us to go together. - I can't. - Why? - I really can't. - Please? - No. - Please? - No. No, no, no. - Please? - [Brother's Girlfriend] Hey. - Hey. - What's up? - Just getting ready to go on a trip. - By yourself? - No, with Laurin. - Our neighbor, Laurin? - Yeah. - I didn't know you guys had become friends already. - Yeah, she's, we just clicked. - Can I come? - Why? - I don't know, it'd just be fun to go on a road trip. - You don't have to come with us this time. - Come on, it'd be fun. I'll ask Daniel, and the four of us can go together. Come on, I'll pack my bag. (car starting) - Sorry for the wait, guys. - [All] It's all right. - Everybody ready? - Yeah. - Let's hit the road. - [Daniel] All right. (light jazz music) - What do you think of these? - They're nice. - You know, whatever you decide about the wedding, I'm good with it. Just can't wait to be married to you. - You're attitude's changed all of a sudden. Why? - I haven't changed, I just want you to be happy. I think I'm gonna go to bed. We forgot toothpaste. - Ask them if they have any. (knocking on door) - Hi. - Hi, do you have toothpaste? - Yeah, hold on. Here you go. We have two, so you can hold on to it. - Okay, thanks. - I have a funny butt. - I think a butt is a person's most important feature. - The butt? - Mm-hmm. A butt says a lot about a person. - What does your butt say about you? - It says that I am kind. - Your butt says that? - Mm-hmm. - What does my butt say? - It says that you'll live a long life. - Why does it say that? - It just does. - Maybe you should quit your insurance agent job and become an ass reader. - You mean like, a palm reader, but I read asses? - Yeah. What else does my butt say? - I think it's a brilliant idea. What else does your butt say? That, you're vulnerable. (soft piano) What are you writing about? - Wouldn't you like to know? (bright orchestral music) (laughing) (crickets chirping) (laughing) - [Daniel] Did you smoke pot? - [Dong] No, we didn't. - [Daniel] Yes you did. (laughing) Did you just smoke pot? - Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. - Whoa. - You can tell me to calm down, but I can't tell you to calm down? - What the hell happened to you? - Nothing. None of your business. (giggling) - Don't you dare smoke pot again. - Okay. (Dong laughing) - Put it out right now! - No! - Don't you dare do this to me. - To you? None of it is about you. - I said, put it out now. - You can't tell me what to do. - I am your brother. - [Sarah] All right, let's not do this here please. - Yeah, a brother who thinks he's the most successful, the most popular, the most important person in the world. That's my brother. - What the hell are you talking about? - I'm talking about you being a self-centered, arrogant, asshole. - [Sarah] Let's just go back to the motel. - Mount Rushmore is an iconic American institution. It should not be (muffled). - I don't see what the big deal is. Aren't they just rocks? - They're not just rocks. - What do you mean, they're not just rocks? - I mean they're not just rocks. - Okay, you don't have to yell at me. I'm just asking a question. - Except well you keep asking the question, you're gonna make yourself sound like you don't know what you're talking about. - Oh okay, so you know everything. Everybody else is an idiot compared to you. - [Sarah] Guys, just stop it. (traffic passing) - [Cashier] Here you go, two dollars. - Cool. (water running) (phone ringing) - Your cell phone's ringing. Hello? - [Man On Phone] When can we do it again? - Who is this? - [Man On Phone] Two days ago you were in my bed and now you don't know me? - Who are you? - [Man On Phone] Why are you marrying that guy? - What? Hello? - [Man On Phone] Oh hi. - I told you never to call me again. - I'm going outside. - No, wait, please please don't go. I haven't said anything about you sleeping with our neighbor, so why can't you do the same for me? (tense music) - Are you feeling sexy or something? - I have to tell you something. - Sure. - I slept with somebody. And I'm so sorry. And it's never gonna happen again. And I don't even know why I did it, but I love you. And I don't, I just can't, I just don't want there to be anything between us. - So, I thought, so you mean, you recently slept with somebody, not like BD, before Daniel? Wow. - [Sarah] We're done. - That's good. (exhaling) What, why? Was this like before we got engaged, or after we got engaged? - After. - So, then why did we get engaged? Why did you say yes to me? - Because I love you and I want to marry you. And I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I don't know why I did it. I guess. (somber piano music) - I found it in your seat. - Where's Sarah? - She left. (crickets chirping) Confession, she brilliantly pointed out. - [Dong] What did she confess? - You know the story. I'm the one who didn't know. - [Dong] I'm sorry I didn't tell you. - It's okay. The wedding's off. - I think you should take her back. - Why? - Because, she really loves you. Besides, mom and dad would be disappointed. - Okay. You've gotta stop that. - Why? - We don't do things just for them. We do things for ourselves, too. - But, wouldn't that be like selfish? - No. - Morning. - Morning. You already made one. - This one's for Laurin, they're her favorite. You want one? - No, thanks. So, you guys wanna leave after breakfast? - Sure. - I'm gonna get more food. (soft piano music) You leave Sarah alone, understand? You understand me? Answer me if you understand me. - Yeah, God. Remember, she came to me first, before you. - [Dong] Punch him! - You understand me? - Loser! (laughing) You okay? - It hurts to punch someone on the face. - He deserved it. - Completely agree. (soft piano music) (crickets chirping) (muffled speaking) - [Laurin] In college I wrote a ton of music. - [Dong] About what? - [Laurin] Memories, how memories define who we are. - [Dong] What if someone doesn't have many memories? - [Laurin] What are you talking about? Everyone has memories. - [Dong] I don't remember much from when I was like eight. Or, when I was 18. Not even when I was 28. And my early 30's are a blur. - [Laurin] I can remember pretty much everything. - [Dong] Why? - [Laurin] Can't help it. - I'll always remember you. (crickets chirping) (soft piano music) I'll always remember you. (laughing) - Margaret? Margaret? - [Dong] Yeah? - What are you doing? - What do you mean? - I've been looking for you all over the place. - [Dong] I was here the whole time. - [Laurin] I thought you left. - I wouldn't leave without you. We came together. Do what? - Never mind. - Why are you acting like this? - I'm sorry, let's just go back. (water sloshing) (tense electronic music) - Do you wanna talk, tell me what's on your mind? - [Laurin] Why did you want me to go to Mount Rushmore? - I thought it was fun. - [Laurin] Fun, for you. - For us. Didn't you have fun? - [Laurin] No. - You didn't? - [Laurin] It was too much memory. Too much memory of Luke and I. - I thought you said you didn't love him anymore. - [Laurin] You're right. You're making this really complicated for me. - No I'm not. - [Laurin] Yeah, yeah you are. - I didn't do anything. - [Laurin] Yes you did. - What did I do? - [Laurin] You showed up. - I showed up? - [Laurin] Yeah, you showed up here. - What about you, what are you doing here? - [Laurin] I live here. - Do you want me to leave? - In the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman. Daniel, repeat after me. In the name of God, I Daniel take you Sarah to be my wife. - [Daniel] In the name of God, I Daniel take you Sarah to be my wife. - [Minister] To have and to hold from this day forward. - To have and to hold from this day forward. - [Minister] For better, for worse. - [Daniel] For better, for worse. - [Minister] For richer, for poorer. - For richer, for poorer. - [Minister] In sickness and in health. - In sickness and in health. - [Minister] To love and to cherish. - To love and to cherish. - [Minister] Until we are parted by death. - Until we are parted by death. - [Minister] This is my solemn vow. - This is my solemn vow. - [Minister] Sarah, repeat after me. In the name of God, I Sarah take you Daniel to by my husband. - In the name of God, I Sarah take you Daniel to by my husband. - [Minister] To have and to hold from this day forward. - To have and to hold from this day forward. - [Minister] For better, for worse. - For better, for worse. (flute music) (congregation applauding) - Woo. (romantic orchestral music) - [Dong] So, how are you doing? - Not too bad. Anything new for you? - Not really. - That's good. (Dong muffled) That's good. - [Dong] Any plans to (muffled) again any time soon? - [George] Yeah, in two weeks. About a month. - Would you excuse me for a moment? - Oh, sure. (romantic orchestral music) - [Dong] Are you having a good time? - Hi. How are you? (gasping) - Luke wants to get back together. - Really? - He said I always wanted a child, and he changed his mind and he wants to give me that, so that we can be a real family. - How do you feel about that? - I was happy at first, when I heard him say it, but then I didn't feel right about it. I still want a child. But he's just not the right one to have one with, so I told him I wasn't gonna let him move back in. - Good for you. - You gonna take good care of yourself? - Yeah. (dramatic music) - Have a wonderful trip. - Thanks. - Come on! - Call us when you get there.
