LEGEND OF THE GALACTIC HEROES When a nation neglects social inequality,.. mischievously increases military preparations... and then uses that power internally to suppress its citizens... ...on the pretext of invasion by an external enemy, that nation is on the road to extinction. This is historical, provable fact. Additionally, at present, we don't have the strength to invade the Empire. Even if we had the pure military might... Due to the defeat at Amlitzer and last year's coup d'etat We have seen a conspicuous decline in battle strength. But that's not all. The nation's finances, productive power, human resources: All of them are dropping. Due to the existence of Iserlohn Fortress, national defence is barely possible. What we must do, is coexist with the Lohengramm system. The Goldenbaum system was an example of a democratically constructed political system... that caused the most anti-democratic administration. But the Lohengramm system... is an example of a non-democratically constructed political system... that is bringing about an exceptionally democratic administration. This isn't government "by the people," but at present is government "for the people." Once we've acknowledged that... coexistence with the Lohengramm system isn't just possible, it becomes necessary. Prince Reinhard von Lohengramm...? It's First Lieutenant Greenhill... Come in. Your Excellency, won't you have tea? Oh, thanks. I was just thinking I'd like to take a little break. Is it progressing? I don't like it very much... I think my conclusion might be a little too hasty. I don't know if it'll improve your mood or not,.. but we've begun to pick up TV broadcasts from Heinessen. Eh? Which one? Therefore, we must not begrudge the lost of the tiny lives of individuals. Those who advocate won't carry out their duties to the nation,.. can't be called anything but cowards! "Tiny lives" is it? To those in power, there's nothing as cheap as other people's lives. Really, when they declared "tiny lives," they showed their true feelings. Those 'tiny lives' have fought for for over five centuries and paid for it. Because it's the general citizenry who bear the expense. To be summoned by that National Defense Chairman,.. it seems you aren't suitably prepared. Prince! Please leave here. But... This place is dangerous. Please, come with us, and plan for your rightful restoration...! Please endure the shame, and wait for a chance! Good! Don't let them escape! Prince! Damn you! I've dreamt of settleing this with you! Evil band! You're a disgrace! It's not for the sake of an evil bunch like you! The howling of a hypocrite? Ehh? I don't care, get them! Yes!! Do you know what kind of business is the sponsor of this program? I think it's a synthetic foods company backed by Phezzan, but why...? Well... The contents being what they are... I thought the supporters of the Galactic Empire's former system ... were making political proclamations again. Impossible! Although it is a subject that could be taken that way... All right, First Lieutenant,.. I think I'm saying a pretty fantastic thing. Only... Only...? I keep coming back to and getting hooked on Phezzan... By which you mean to say...? The Alliance and the Lohengramm system ought to be able to coexist. So long as ridiculous doctrinism doesn't lapse into theorism. Yes. But if that happens, it's Phezzan that will be at a loss. If friendly relations are established, their existence becomes meaningless. So, Phezzan hopes that there's a rupture... between the Alliance and the Empire forever? Yes. Still more, the Lohengramm system might become real in the near future... ...and we might have to combine efforts in order to unify the universe under the new Empire. From the economic side of things, there are many reasons why a united nation would be desirable. Even I think it's too pessimistic a theory. But the situation is such that, I've been thinking a great deal about just that coming to pass. Only Phezzan's intentions...? That's not all, but I'm worried. It's not that I have any basis especially, but I sense something like a shadow coming... Hadn't we better make contact with HQ Chief Kubersly,.. or Commander-in-Chief Bucock? No, because that's uninviting. Because it was a top secret order. Admiral Yang. I'm employed as His Excellency Chairman Truniht's Chief of Guards, Commodore Bay. This time, I've been ordered to be Admiral Yang's bodyguard. Although I am unworthy, I will undertake it conscientiously. Thanks for your trouble. Come, Admiral. What?! By orders of the National Defense Chairman, I was told to bring Admiral Yang alone. I ask that you keep this dignified, and secret. What'll we do, First Lieutenant? It can't be helped. For the time being, let's investigate where they're taking him. We can't do anything if we don't know where he is. Please rest here. If you need anything, he'll be stationed outside, so please ask. I'll go inform His Excellency... the National Defense Chairman that you've arrived. This is imprisonment. They're unrefined rascals. Your Excellency, the Inquiry will be convened in one hour. I'll guide you to the Inquiry room, so please get ready. Impatience is taboo, Yang Weng-Li. Did you find out anything? I found out where Commodore Bay went. Let's go to the Council Building. I think you must know by now, but I convened this Inquiry. I'm National Defense Chairman Negroponti. Admiral Yang, you can take a seat. No, no, you can't cross your legs! Sit up straighter! You're the one being inquired about. Don't forget your place. Not that I particularly asked... Did you say something? No. Well, then, we'll convene the Inquiry. The Inquiry began by confirming Yang's past record. Yang Weng-Li was born in S.E. 767,.. the son of a merchant, Yang Tai-Long. His mother died when he was five. He was taken by his father and raised inside an interstellar spaceship. When he was sixteen, although he'd gotten his father's reluctant permission... to study history, his father died in an accident. His father's financial situation was bankruptcy. When it became clear that almost all of the antiques... he inherited were fakes, he was in a penniless situation. Unavoidably, to study history without charge,.. he enrolled in the War History Studies Department of the Alliance Army Officers' School. Regrettably, because the Department was abolished, he switched to Strategic Studies. But the contrast is conspicuous. Aren't there a lot of marks that are just about failing? Because 55 points is the borderline, eh? I enrolled in Officers' School because I had no choice. But if I had really failed, maybe history would have been pretty different. Iserlohn Fortress would still be in the hands of the Empire. On the other hand, we wouldn't have had the crushing defeat at Amlitzer. If so, how many tens of thousands of soldiers could have gone on without dying? But in that case... ...it's possible that by now the Alliance would have been destroyed by Prince Lohengramm. Really, that guy called history... And, at present, you are the youngest Admiral in the Alliance Army... ...and the highest ranking commander at the front lines. This fact is the good fortune that people envy, isn't it. If you're that envious, how about if we swap? But, in our democratic nation, nobody is allowed to exceed the law and behave arbitrarily. Today's Inquiry is in order to clear away suspicions related to that point. Here is the first question... So, it's come... Last year, on the occasion when you suppressed... the 'Save-the-Nation Military Council's' coup d'etat... ...you destroyed all twelve of the "Artemis' Necklace" satellites. Isn't that correct? Yes. Wasn't this, unlike you, a truly hasty and coarse choice? The question has come up that maybe your intention was somewhere else, but...? But you're suspicious I might be after your jobs??? Wasn't there some other way? For example, if you'd destroyed two or three of the satellites... Shouldn't you have been able to descend into the atmosphere? I'll answer. If I'd taken that method, there is no doubt that we would have been attacked by the other remaining satellites... ...and sacrifices would have resulted among the soldiers of our army. If you say you value unmanned satellites more than the troops' lives,.. my decision becomes mistaken, but... Then, what about waging a war of attrition. Surrounding Heinessen, and chipping away at their will to fight? I also thought of that method, but I had to tear it up because of two points. What are those? In the first place, there was the danger that... the psychologically cornered coup d'etat faction... would take important people in the government... who were in the capitol as hostages, in order to break the deadlock. If they came pressing for negotiations with guns pressed to your heads,... we would have had no margin of choice. Number two was also a big danger. At the time, the civil war in the Empire was coming to a close. If we'd leisurely waited for the self-destruction of the coup d'etat... Reinhart von Lohengramm, that genius at war,.. might have followed up his victory by invading with a large force. Based on the above two points, I achieved the liberation of Heinessen in a short time. Moreover, I couldn't avoid taking a measure... that would give a psychological sense of defeat to the coup d'etat. If that deserves censure, I will meekly accept it. But as I can't be shown an alternative plan with a higher degree of perfection than that one... Never mind me, my subordinates, who fought at the risk of their lives, probably woould agree. Well, leaving this general subject, we'll turn to the next topic. Before you fought with the coup d'etat faction's 11th Fleet, you spoke to the troops of the whole army. You said that the fate of nations and so forth was of no account when compared to individual freedoms and rights. There's been testimony by many people who heard that, but there's no mistake, is there? I couldn't say it was like that word for word. But I certainly said something resembling that. Don't you think it's a disgraceful utterance? Ehh? What is? You're a soldier who's been given the duty of protecting the nation. And you say that it isn't a disgrace to your position to make speeches that belittle that nation? You say so, Your Excellency Chairman. I think that was an unusually profound utterance for me. Because a nation doesn't create individuals by cellular-division. Instead it is individuals with autonomous intent who gather to establish a nation. In a democratic society, it is axiomatic as to which one is the master and which the servant. Axiomatic, eh? My understanding is rather different. Humans are social creatures. Nobody can live alone, as such the nation holds indispensable value to people. Really? People can live, even without nations, but nations can't exist without people. Well, I'm surprised. You're a pretty radical anarchist. You're wrong. I'm a vegetarian. Although, as soon as I look at a delicious meat dish, I break my commandments at once. Admiral Yang! Do you mean to mock this Inquiry?! Far from it, I don't have that intention in the least. If you please, let's take a breather here. Admiral Yang is also tired, and I'm feed... No, I'm exhausted. I'd be grateful to be allowed to take a rest. Commodore Bay! As Admiral Yang's adjutant, I'm seeking an interview with my superior officer. Where is the Admiral? It's a matter that belongs to the nation's highest secrets. Interviews and such can't be permitted, and I also can't tell you the Admiral's whereabouts. Understood. You're saying that an "Inquiry" means private, psychological torture? Be careful what you say. If you're saying I'm wrong... I request the opening of the Inquiry to the public, the attendance of a lawyer... ...as well as an interview with the accused. I can't respond to that kind of request. What could be the reason you can't respond to it? I don't acknowledge the need to answer that. Well, then, should I let the press know that one portion of high government officials... ...is arbitrarily trying to psychologically lynch Admiral Yang, who's a national hero? Try and tell them. No journalist anywhere will pick it up. Far from it, as soon as you've done that, we'll apply the National Defense Secrets Law. You yourself will be court-martialed. It doesn't fall under a court-martial. As there's no precedent under the National Defense Law for any thing such as an Inquiry. Publicizing knowledge of it doesn't constitute a crime. If you continue to ignore Admiral Yang's human rights and force a secret Inquiry... I too will be forced to take all possible measures. If the father's the father, the daughter's his daughter. Why, you...! Let's go. When I was prepared to be dismissed from my post as adjutant, I went to him, prepared for that, but... Without you, I'll be at a loss... I didn't want to do it, but it's the measure of last resort. I'll see Admiral Bucock, and get him to help us. Understood. Put the mass media under the control of the Cabinet Information Board. Tell Negroponti, too. So, Greenhill's daughter...? Sir! At any rate, it seems she's going to the Space Fleet HQ. We put a tail on her, but she's probably going to contact Admiral Bucock directly. That old man? Understood. You should leave. Sir! It's me. Is the boss there? You've appointed First Lieutenant Frederica Greenhill as your adjutant? What of it? She's the daughter of Admiral Greenhill, who caused a revolt against democracy last year. You must be aware of that, but... Oho? In our free country, why must the crimes of the father extend to the child, like an ancient autocracy? That's not what I'm saying. It can't be interpreted as anything other than that. What I'm saying is... Isn't there a need to be concerned about personnel matters. In order to avoid needless misunderstandings? And won't you tell me concretely what "needless misunderstandings" might mean? In the absents of proof or grave doubts... I don't feel the need to prepare for unreal things such as "needless misunderstandings." In relation to personnel affairs regarding adjutants... ...the right of military commanders to appoint them is protected by law. So if you're telling me to dismiss the most talented and reliable adjutant possible. I don't think it's anything but opposing and obstructing taking full advantage of the army's functionality. But should I understand it to be so? Admiral Yang, we'll get defensive, too, if we're spoken to in that way. You and we aren't enemies. With more good sense and logic, shouldn't we seek a mutual understanding? Today's receptions are over. Besides, the waiting time for meetings with the Commander in Chief is a minimum of three days. But if you'd like to make an appointment... I can't tell you what the subject is here, but it's an urgent situation! Even so, it's already time for the Commander in Chief to leave, so he probably is no longer in his office. Excuse me, but aren't you His Excellency Greenhill's daughter? Yes, but who are you? Well, you probably don't know me, but I was pretty indebted to your father. Never mind that. If you're looking for Commander-in-Chief Bucock. I just saw him in the parking garage on the fourth floor. If you go at once, I think you can catch him. Really? Use the #6 lift over there. It goes directly there. Thank you very much. We're in a hurry, so excuse us. They got on. It's according to plan. She's only got one bodyguard. That's odd... The PKC! Get 'em! All of you, control that guy! I'll take the target! Officer! Damn girl...! First Lieutenant Die! What are you doing?! Oh, no! Withdraw! Follow them! Are you OK? Yes. Thank you very much! You...?! First Lieutenant! What are you doing in a place like this?! Your Excellency...!! "Terra is my Mother, Terra in my hands"...? We didn't summon you in order to disdain you. Rather, this Inquiry should have been convened in order to better your situation. Of course, your cooperation is also necessary,.. and we intend not to begrudge our cooperation towards you. Then I have one request. What? If there's a list of sample questions and answers, couldn't you show it to me? I want to know what kinds of answers you expect. I will warn you! To strictly refrain from mocking this Inquiry, and all words or actions that ridicule its authority or dignity! Yeah! What are you saying?! Authority and dignity...? It's a disgusting story. The truth is, I was pretty much at a loss... I'd like to get support to save Admiral Yang... But if I do wrong, it will add to the antagonism between the military and the government. It's a reasonable worry. But, at the same time, it's also a needless worry. Which means, it's already impossible for the military itself to confront the government in unison. Are you saying the military is internally divided into two camps? Two camps?! Yes, unmistakably two camps. If you can compare the overwhelming majority camp with the minority camp equally. Of course, I'm in the minority. It's nothing to brag about, either. How in the world did it get like that? It's awkward to speak of it, but if you ask the cause... It was the Save-the-Nation Military Council's coup d'etat last year. Due to that, the military lost its popularity, and its right to speak up. The damned politicians took advantage of it by permeating their own influence into the military. The rascals manage military affairs just as they please. And HQ has been thoroughly secured by the rascals' agents. Because neither HQ Chief Kubersly nor I did anything on the occasion of last year's coup d'etat, we're tolerated... But even if we protest, we're just laughed at. What should I say to you...? I didn't know it would be such trouble. What, it's not particularly any bother. It's just annoying. It's obnoxious, like a rustling noise. The truth is, there might also be listening devices hidden in this room; I'm 90% sure of it. The reason I spoke this way, even while knowing that... Is because I can't camouflage the color of my flag now when it's too late. And the memory of eavesdroppers doesn't constitute legal proof. On the contrary, I can complain about human rights violations due to eavesdropping. IF the government feels like respecting the Alliance Constitution. The government can't openly trample the principles of democracy. In case of need, I think that can be used for a weapon. I'm happy to be told so by a First Lieutenant who's noted for her intelligence. Therefore, on the most important subject of Admiral Yang... Now that I've comprehended the circumstances, I'll do what I can. Then, it's not putting you to any trouble? Having already come to call, you shouldn't worry about a thing like that when it's too late. I like that young man. Although, I can't say this kind of thing to the man himself. Because the young man will get stuck-up at once. I'm really grateful. And, speaking while presuming upon your character, I like Your Excellency Bucock, too. By all means, I want to let my wife hear that. Oh, yeah.. You should stay at our house until the matter's settled. We can't have anymore things like today happening. Thank you very much. But how did they know I'd come here? Weren't you tailed? I'm not certain, but I did see one suspicious landcar. If it was a tail, I think they exchanged places en route. After all, it's something that cockroach Bay WOULD do. First Lieutenant, this is the present condition of the chief temple of democracy. The rain hasn't yet begun to fall, but the thickness of the clouds is worrisome. It's getting worse very quickly. It's not easy to reverse this weather. Yes, I'm prepared. Good. Because we're friends. Even though the times are changing. I want to go out for a while to eat. We'll prepare your meals here. There's no need to go out expressly. I have no appetite in this kind of dreary place. When you go outside the gates, you need Commodore Bay's permission. But I don't particularly WANT permission. Whether you want it or not isn't the problem. Even though it's Your Excellency, if you don't obey the rules... Well, then, can't you let me see Commodore Bay? The Commodore has gone out on duty to the Supreme Council Chairman's office. When will he come back? It's difficult to know. Is there going to be an Inquiry tomorrow morning? That, too, is hard to tell. We'll inform you of the situation directly, so please wait for that here. Well, is that all you wanted? Yes, that's all. Then, please take it easy. Can I allow this to be done to me?! I'll quit. This time, I swear, I'll really quit. Since occupying Iserlohn Fortress, wasn't it those guys who wouldn't ever let me quit?! Doing whatever they want, for guys... for guys who are sitting snug in a safe place, do they have any right to complain?! I'll quit! Absolutely, I WILL quit!! Such tedium... Even when we go out on patrol, we have too much spare time. A distortion has broken out in the space ahead. Something's warping out. The distance is 300 light seconds. The mass... The mass is... The mass is... EXTREMELY large... Can't you report more accurately?! Mass, approximately 40 billion tons!! It's not a spaceship. It's spherical! Full speed retreat! All ships, retreat! We'll be engulfed in the temperospatial quake! That's...!!! A Fortress...? S.E. 798, Imperial Year 489, April 10. Geiersburg Fortress invaded Iserlohn Circuit. Inquiry NEXT EPISODE
