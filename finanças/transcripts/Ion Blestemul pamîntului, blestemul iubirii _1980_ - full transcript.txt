THE CURSE OF LOVE AFTER THE NOVEL "ION" BY LIVIU REBREANU Good day! No, how come, John? Everyone is plowing, only you walk around? Only the fool hurries! Tell me, my dear. Can I work all our lands alone? I have to assume some helping hands. Good day. Yes, Ion, you must. Only you see... everybody is in a hurry and the labor is more expensive. In about a week, ten days, people are cheaper. Am I not right? You're right, Ionica. Sit down! You see that, even if I am alone I can manage! I should find a younger widow until I feel strong. So father-in-law, we came to talk about tabulation. God give us luck. Good luck. Ana, drink it too, it's sweetened. It's good for your health. Which tabulation? That is, to do the documents at the notary. Which notary? Well, didn't we bargain like that? We bargained, but you see, but if I give you the land, what will I have left? Or do you want to see me as a servant? God forbid, you'll stay with us! Do you mean to be your servant? Why servant? No, no, my son. Let's not talk about it in vain. I'm not saying I don't give it to you. But after I die. Then you'll do as you know. As long as I live, you won't have nothing. Really nothing? As you heard. What do you mean, and how about me? I thought at this, too. I don't want you to tell me that you fed my daughter or took her without dowry. I let you choose five places you like. Take them, work them, they are yours. But I won't sign anything. Is that how you keep your promise, father-in-law? So. All right. Let's see what others say. Yes, let's see, can you tell? Who can force me to give it to you if I don't want to? Or take away my fortune? Boy, did you think you could fool me? You were wrong! Good luck! Why did you shut up? What was it to say? What was it like to say? You should have said they're yours! Or maybe you agreed to make fun of me? Ionica.. Ionica, Ionica! Leave me alone, damn it! Take it easy to go back and talk to him. He is not a bad man, believe me. It's just that he's stubborn. And how are you? Don't come back without it, have you heard? Hello! What, did he drive you away? How could he, Dad? Daddy, be good, please, do it for me. For me and the baby. Because you agreed. There are witnesses that you agreed. And now I... please... What, now both of you agreed to rob me? Whore! Shut up, shut up... Be patient and shut up. It's written that the woman must endure and be silent. You can't do anything, God left it like that! My luck.. My luck.. Florica! You must know that I did everything for you. And wait for me. Do you hear? Wait. Until when, Ion? Until when? Ioane, young man... It's not nice what you're doing. Who are the gentlemen? What seizure? Mom, you know, the rates. What seizure? The policy. I didn't mean to upset you. I didn't want to ruin the joy of the wedding. In fact, the judge is following me. Honorable lady, a simple formality. As I had the honor to explain to Mr. Herdelea Don't worry, ma'am, everything will be fine. Everything will be fine, ma'am. My little things, my dear little things. God, where did we end up... All this will end when Grofsorul will be a deputy! Now you will understand, too, Dad, that only one of our deputies can save us from all these... these mischiefs - Servus, colleague. - Hi, Doctor. We will win. The hour of salvation will ring for us too! Mr. Lawyer! Don't worry! Relax! Your case is almost settled! Are you a voter? It seems to me... How come? Are you or are you not? See, that's why we suffer so, because we know neither our rights, nor our duties, nor our obligations. Lawyer, we're all going to vote for you. Well, you see? Do you have witnesses? I have Cioara's Mitrea and Gheorghe's... Very well, don't worry, I'll take all your lands back, just make sure the witnesses don't change their minds. Now, the fee. I pray? The money. My money, lad, or are you just thinking about yours? Servus, Cornelius. We're standing, are we? "Virtus romana rediviva" (Renaissance of Roman Virtue) John, half now, half after trial. 300 crowns. Come on, come on, I don't have time to bargain. It suits you, well, it doesn't suit you, you're looking for another lawyer. Yes Miss. Mr. Lawyer, please. My trial. Mr. Lawyer. So, see? Yes, Miss, I'm listening to you. Dad, please don't throw the "Disgrace on our nation" Don't throw the weight of your position on the scales of a Herman Beck Our Grofsoru will break the walls of the Pesta (Hungary) parliament For a damned trial, because you defended a Romanian peasant in distress, to betray a cause? Do you think Beck will speak kindly to you? Boy, don't forget that for now, even the bed you sleep in is under seizure. The man should take care of his life, that's all, the rest is the job of the big ones! Why doesn't Laura write to us? You are terrible! Terrible! He is young! If you don't want to make any sacrifices, how will we ever succeed? I ask you how? He will fight for our rights This is the hour of the emancipation, this is the long awaited hour for which we sighed with bitterness and melancholy, the wind of freedom blows! Our deputy will be Grofsor! Hurrah! Bravo, bravo! You'll get bigger than Cosbuc! I didn't get a chance to talk to him. You know, the events between us. Look at him, our Grofsor is speaking! Dear Romanians, manifesting ourselves in the united struggle for our own national life The guarantee of all our historical and eternal rights on this earth, against hatred and forgery in the battles of a thousand years! Come on, guys, make room, make room! We are voters. Sorry..Voters' certificates. Sure... The old and well-known bureaucracy: distrust! Here you go. Where's your document? The certificate? His father-in-law has not yet registered his fortune in his name, he is not in line with the people. Go away, you confuse the world. Come on. This has no recent stamp. What is my fault, father, if your constituents do not respect the legal forms? And yes, Lieutenant... You're Romanian, I met your father, I'm sorry! Me too. I'm an officer, Father, I obey orders. Here, in what condition is it... you can't even read the name. Back! Get back! He killed me! What happened? He cut me! Let's see! He has nothing! Brothers, terror... innocent blood has flowed! You agitate the crowd! I make you directly responsible for any consequences! Terror! Innocent blood flowed! Renegade! Shame on you, traitor! Come on! Herr Herdelea.. I'm sorry, Mr. Herdelea. Please don't intimidate voters. We do not allow any moral pressure. Good thing you allow material pressures in the form of sword points! Come on! Lawyer? And my trial? No results yet? Which process? My trial with Baciu Vasile. Ah... it works perfectly. It doesn't matter.. There will be other elections. We also learn from defeats. We know your fraud system. That's the result, if we're not united. Five votes! - Congratulations! - Thanks. - Congratulations! - Thanks. If you allow me, I want to introduce you to one of our supporters... Professor Herdelea from Pripas. Glad, glad. I would dare to inform the Member a very personal matter. Despite the intrigues of some I assure you of my unwavering loyalty to the crown and the monarchy. Dear Mr. Herdelea.. I promise I'll take care of your case personally. Thank you. I'm waiting for you. I'm Mr. Herdelea, the teacher from Pripas. I allowed myself to hand you a memorandum... Yes... Mr. Herdelea, you think I was elected in His Majesty's parliament to neglect state affairs and deal with the intrigues of some peasants? When you are elected to an important position in the state, you must be like a protective wall around His beloved Majesty and don't be interested in trifles. Like some criminals. Do you understand? Take the memorandum to the village gendarmerie chief. It's his responsibility. What about yours? What is your responsibility? To lie and make vain promises to be chosen, and then to forget the burdens of the people? Have you forgotten where you are? - I have not forgotten. I forgot before. When I stepped on my mission as a Romanian teacher, an upset one and I gave you my vote. It doesn't matter. Maybe I needed this lesson now, in my old age to understand, what I actually knew for a long time that you have nothing to expect from the oppressors. That smells like rebellion. So now you understand Romanian! When it comes to..that..I understand. I'm proud of you, Dad. Now I'm proud of you. I don't know if I did well, but I couldn't. Titu, understand me and forgive me... for I for you... if I were alone.. If I didn't have these family responsibilities, if I were still young... If it weren't for so many troubles..My dear.. Young, old, with our troubles, with our human misery, we still have to remember something... I know, lawyer, but for the common man... ideals are one thing and realities are another. And what does the youth say? That outside our ideals there is no point in living. The life is different. Let... what do you know about life, baby... I think he knows better than we do. Of course he knows better than we do. Florica? - Someone sees us. - Who? It's past midnight. Florica! When the judge asks you, say you fell on my knees... and I refused you five times. And you started writing the plea with your own hand. I only translated it for you, so you must swear, do you hear? Yes, godfather, don't worry. I will go in prison in your place. Shut up, stop jinxing. It's not good either. Can you hear what I'm saying? Yes, godfather. Then look how you say and swear: That you came to me with a bottle of brandy and we kept drinking and because I am not used to and under the influence of alcohol... remember? That's right, but God would punish me. I think that in court we'll find also my lawyer, Grofsoru. John, I'm afraid we will both have bad luck today. Then, God willing. Come on! As the complaint shows, ...even if the venerable Father Belciug claims he knows nothing about the complaint. I would like to make public my unwavering loyalty to the crown and the monarchy. As you can see from my behavior during the election when Mr Beck was elected Member of Parliament. As I explained to Mr. Beck... Please return to the topic! ...I wrote that complaint under the influence of alcohol, without thinking about the consequences. Ion Pop Glanetas... asked me and kept insisting on translating his complaint. I did the right thing, didn't I? In the name of His Majesty the Emperor Glanetas Pop Ion, I sentence you to five months in prison and a fine of 100 crowns for defaming the legal system and obstructing justice. In the name of His Majesty the Emperor Herdelea Zaharia, teacher in the village of Pripas, I sentence you to eight days in prison and a fine of 50 crowns for complicity. The meeting is over. You can go out. The next case. What did he say? What did he say, godfather? Godfather, what is it? God forbid! John, we'll start the action soon. I also sent him a subpoena. Yes, Mr. Herdelea, you have seen their justice. Of those for whom... finally, you were out of luck. This president is a soulless dog. You should expect to be suspended from your job. Of course, temporarily, until the judgment of the appeal. If you want to appeal again, Hm? Anyway, that's your affair. You don't have to worry... We will win against Vasile Baciu! God bless you for many years to come! Stop, I'm not a bishop! It's okay, godfather. I 'll go in prison in your place, too. Suspended.. And I pay the fine..Everything. Suspended. I will pay, I can afford it Suspended. Did he bargain for a lawyer, throw money left and right? God damn him! Yes, why don't you come to terms, Vasile? People have to agree, if nothing else. Who are you going to reconcile with, man, with... hoheri (executioner)? Anything else? Later.. I don't mix in, Vasile. Boy, I would have gave you everything. ...and without any paper. I say this: To write as much as you promised, he thinks anyway. ...I wouldn't take it from you. Avrume! Give me a splash too. Wait, what are you shouting like that? Wait! But, who do you think you are, to tell me to wait? The mute or Rica could serve me! Why are you holding a pub if you tell me.. Rica! Yes! Ion, come here because no one is eating you. Good luck, father-in-law. God would beat us, what kind of father-in-law and son-in-law we are. Is it my fault? Look, Ion, I don't want the people should make fun of us.. I will give you what I have promised, (I'll make the documents), five pieces of land and a house, so that there will be no misunderstanding. Let's celebrate it. Avrume, bring some "horinca" the best you have, not the crap you put all kinds of poisons in! Woe is me, Mr. Bulbuc, how can you say such a thing? Avrum, when do you give me the money? Today! So, shake hands. Yes, but the process goes ahead, you know. How? So. For the time being it will be according to your will. But let the judgment give me my full right. What did you say? If you willingly do what you say and do the deeds, we will make the trial on less. On the land which is left. God damn you, you bastard! Then, you want to see me a beggar? Ioane.. Ionica, tell me.. What did I do to you, what did I do to you, YOU? Tell me, what did I do to you? I want my right, nothing else! Avrum! Add another Fernet! What my father-in-law broke, I will pay, too. That's the way things are, what can we do... The same, Mr. Ion...? Yes. Here you go. Long live, father-in-law and may God make you think straight. Better drink the money that throw it away on trials. Nothing. I don't give you anything. And you, brother, how are you? My respects Unfortunately, they don't know hungarian It doesn't matter, I will speak romanian By the way, that's what they say, right? I brought you a paper from the inspectorate, Mr. Herdelea. But let's move on to ours. Hello. Here comes your help. How sad the house is without Miss... I'm sorry, Mrs. Laura. I hope the married couple do well. They write to you every day, don't they? What do the do? What do they want? It's just a formality. Amateur, amateur? A friend, sir. A walnut table, 23 crowns... 24. 24 once. - 26. - 26 o data.. - 30. - 30 o data.. - 33. - Wait! Don't you see that he wants to win them for us? You deposit the money right away, don't you? Yes, of course. Then I give up. 33 crowns. Let's move on. As you think. Thanks. Am I not interested in a believer? No. Go. Go with the good and merciful God. Go to your father, Ana, because I can't support you anymore. You see, I'm poor, I don't have nothing to eat. He has enough wealth. He cheated on me and made me laugh at the world, but it's nothing. God in heaven sees us and judges us. You know how dear you were and you are to me. Go and God be with you. And take care of yourself. What are you doing here? He kicked me out, Daddy. Well, stay here because you have a place to stay. Now... maybe God made you think right. You're married, we're not ashamed anymore... What can we do? That's life. Maybe you can find someone who could take you, in your state... You are neither the first nor the last who.. Sit down, drink some milk. I have come, dear Ion. We came for further advice. The process starts next week and I want to... I mean I'm sure we'll win it! Welcome inside..Leave it! Welcome inside! Mom, where the hell are you? It's good here too.. Bring something to drink quickly. It doesn't matter, I'm just passing through. First and foremost, you bring your wife home. I understand. Because if she stays with her father, he can declare that you chased her and you have no rights. I didn't chase her, lawyer. What do you have with my table? What do you want from it? That's how I got along with Zacharias, I just paid for it! Is that how you got along? I know you're mad, but what can I do? ...I have no choice! I just needed a table like this.. God forbid! You want to steal my housework, thief! Greasy one! Get out of here, you bastard, I will twist your throat! Shame on you! You'll pay one of these days! I'll drag you through the courts and you'll end up begging under the bridges! You pig, you bastard! Under the bridges! What do you want with my table? I'll teach you what is the meaning of kindness if your father didn't teach you! And what are you laughing, naughty! Shame on you all! Ahh, Mr. Herdelea! I heard about the suspension. You should have come to me with the lawsuit. We're getting away with it. You didn't do well to avoid me. Lawyer. I was wrong about you and the nation. Leave it, it's nothing. What was, it's gone. I understood you and I approved you inside of me. I am ready to help you, I am not vindictive, I do not think about the past, only and only about the future! Because we are Romanians. Yes, we are... Mr. Herdelea, if you want I can offer you a place as a writer in my office. I know you're good at office work. As for the salary, I hope we will agree. Good? Mr. Lawyer... Mr. Lawyer! My dear, but what's the matter with you? Forgive me, Doctor... Forgive me... Courage, brother! I'm not worthy... Courage! See what you're doing, John. Yes, sir. There is no man in Europe like our Grofsor... do you hear, John? Tulai.. Maybe she is in labor! Look at her, the idiot. She knows her time has come and she came here to deliver in the field (like an animal)! Shut up, you bastard, who are you like? Don't you see that she came to be with you when... Oh, Ana. Come on, mother's little girl. Mother-in-law, I die! Shut up, don't jinks it! Endure and keep quiet! Come on, come on, my darling, come on! Poor her.. Rabda, mother's baby..Rabda and shut up.. Come on, come on! That's the woman's fate, what can you do... Shut up, shut up.. Come on, it's ready now! Come on, mother's daughter, it's ready now! Come on, calm down. The child.. Give me something to cut the baby's navel! What is it, Mom? It's a boy, ma, it's a boy! God, how I suffered. He's a boy. The mother-in-law says he looks like you. Look at your treasure. Give him to me. My baby.. Take him, you'll get tired of him. Let's go, it's getting late. Laura! Dear one! But what is this mess, mother... Are we moving? Yes, we're leaving. We'are leaving all we have gained in a lifetime! I told you, Dad. I told you not to interfere in the affairs of others and to take better care of your own troubles. Because of him... because of this rascal.. I kiss Miss Laura's hand, welcome. Hello Hello. How are you doing, Laura? Thank God, okay. Well done, Mom. I'm glad. Until we put up our small but nice household, we had a lot of work to do. But how nice and kind my George was, I have no words to describe it. Alas, father, what a shame you have done to us. To vote for Beck... You came to stay with us for a few days, didn't you? Alas, and right now when, alas... No, mother, I'm just passing through. I have to go to our in-laws. The archpriest in his youth was a martyr, he spent two months in prison. It's one thing, Dad, to go to jail for our cause and another thing is what you did, writing because you wanted to feel important. How much you have changed! Yes, I feel it too.. Although I'm wondering how I was able to live without knowing George for so long? And when you think you didn't love him... you loved Aurel... Child nonsense.. We laugh at it with George, because, you know, I don't hide anything, anything, anything from him. But a girl does not live until she gets married. That's why the girls' minds must be cleared by certain ideas. Life is different. What's wrong with him? You'd better make yourself a life on your own Nobody ever lived from poetry. Poet! The poets die on the side of roads or in shameful illnesses hospitals. Ion... Ion! - Who is it? - Me. Come with me to Armadia. Why? You come or you don't come? Because... I don't have time to break up with you. I'll come. What do you want? Me, nothing. My father-in-law brought me here. What to do, notary... We came to make a deal. That's the way it is today. Why spend on lawsuits, roads... We spend money and in the end what do we have? Who knows? Yes... Now I'm getting old... who knows how many days God will keep me... I worked hard enough, I worked hard, we worked hard with the world... Am I not right, Ioane? Well.. Good, very good So I thought I'd give them what I had left ...so I'd know I gave them everything. and that I don't care anymore. OK then. And how many lots are left? There would be eight more, Mr. Notary. It's the big corn land in Lunci then four with oats in Zahata and then three spring flocks on the border of Sascuti. There would also be the house. He knows them better than you. Everything, everything... to finish it Put your finger on it. Sign there. Of your own free will, bace Vasile? Of my own free will. You see yourself. So... They will be ready in a few days. And look, you came here rich man and now leave a beggar. How strange is this life... Thanks a lot. Good luck. Now, dear father... don't worry. Will live together as in heaven. You didn't believe me. You worked hard, you worked hard. Get rest now. Ready! I will obey to you. And watch growing up Petrisor, the nephew. And I.. You thief! You brought me... beggar! Beggar. You screwed me up, thief! Thief! Pauper! Who's sarantoc now? Folks, tell me, who is the pauper now? - Ion... - What do you want? Pardon me... I'm coming back. Ion... we're getting married. Florica said to ask you to be our godfather. But I didn't want to. You know why I didn't want to... I thought that anyway.. Who would you have as a godfather? Mr. Dernstein. God forbid! A Jew? But our Lord Jesus Christ, wasn't he a Jew, too? Come to our wedding with Ana. Like us, what was between us was. But know that I'm not upset. How about buying a combine harvester? That's what I thought. Why should we give all our grain to those bastards? Come on, let's play Florica. After we got married, the youth is finished! Bring another one! I see you're enjoying yourselves. You've "worked a lot" all your lives. Now you are! Did you give food to the cattle? - He sleeps! - He sleeps! It's obvious he's sleeping... what else can he do? - What is that? - A book. - What? - Verses.. By Cosbuc. "From other countries full of sunshine, where you have been strangers come back, dear birds, welcome!" Nonsense! "Dear birds"? Lyrics? The others drink outside and you with your nonsense! Damn you all! Ionica, why are you persecuting me? Shut up! What did I do wrong to you? Shut up, I will kill you! Why can't we, as all human being... You never said a kind word to me. Florica! Why? And you, proud bride, be honored like Sara. rejoice like Raveca multiply like Rachel making love with your husband. All with gifts for brides... The godfather dances with the bride! Leave it to others, brother... what you want is impossible! What can I do if the client dissapeared? Damn it! He will appear in the end! Mr. Pop, I heard you're interested in a combine harvester! - I'm going to kill myself, John. - What do you say? I'm going to kill myself. All right. I'm going to kill myself. He's not dead yet! Hurry up and cut his rope! Hurry! Faster! But where is Rica? Yes, why are you looking at? Don't you have a job? Go home! Look at her... she has a baby and... But why did he hang himself? Who knows what trouble he would have had, like everyone else! Stupid man! It's warm... it's still warm! What can I do for him? Why do they bother him in vain... Now if he's dead, let him rest, poor man! Now, where else do we drink if the fool killed himself? We find where.. Come to me then... such nausea took me... You can come to us too. Didn't you go home yet? Why they should come? To hear the baby screaming? Get out of here until... Can you give us something to drink, young and beautiful wife? How do you brag? Is Floricuta well married? - Well, why not? - Is the man worthy of her? Give her something to eat on the street all day Lord, have mercy. Hello, sir. How are you? You did it. If you hadn't taught me, sir, I would have been worse than a gypsy! Wait.. What did I teach you, Ion? Don't you remember what you told me? That I have to force Baciu Vasile to give me Ana? And I forced him. I? I forced him, thank you. Great thing to be instructed! I? I? Yes, who else? Come inside to drink something. I have wine, brandy and everything you crave. Mother! Put something on the table! What did I teach you, John? What the? Fuck you, you fool! - Hello! - Ah, Titus. Hello! Father... I'm leaving. Where, darling? To Bucharest. I kept sitting, I was upset. I thought... what is waiting for me here? Low intrigues. Shattered dreams. Yes... as everyone thinks. We here, as we are, as God has left us, hold up the flame of national consciousness! In the midst of intrigues and pettiness, as you say. Father... reconcile with my father. I'm not the one who has to apologize. But you are the one who must forgive. First of all, it is our duty to guide people. to save them, to clean them, if necessary, with the whip, of what lies in them! That's how I understood my mission. Farewell. Farewell. Titu.. God help you, darling! And don't forget us! What do you mean, Savista? Poor thing, what do you mean? Florica..Ion... Florica.. Gheorghe kills her. Everyone kills... everyone. God, Ana, why are you wasting your precious time with the mad of the village? We look like gypsies, not human beings! Aren't you a little ashamed? And you, let me not see you around here! You bring bad luck! Come on, get away! You don't care about this baby anymore, you don't care about the house anymore. I wonder how Ionica didn't feel sick and disgusted with you! Give me the baby, Ana. So, there you go. Come on... come on, ma. No, it's just good for you! To.. Aren't you okay? Take a sip of brandy. God forbid. What is Ana doing in the surah? God damn me if I don't let her hair down and if I don't sweep the yard with it! God help me! Help! Help, Ionica! I beg your pardon, Lord, for losing the power of my mind, for taking my life which was not mine. It was yours, Lord, and I had no right over it. God forgive her! I apologize and say goodbye to you Ion whom I loved so much and who loved me so much. God forgive her. And receive me, O Lord, among the righteous and forgive me, for I did not deserve the holy land of the cemetery. God forgive her! Bolunda! She had everything and I didn't let her do anything! I say goodbye to you, my dear baby, Petrisor - Dear Dad. - And to grow big.. Big and strong, carry on the honor of your father. I say goodbye to you, Zenobia, who treated me so nicely... as if you were my good mother. Oh, God, my dear. Why did you leave us? Why did you leave us? I can't, I can't... My darling, our darling! Shut up now. Enough! I say goodbye to you, Dad and please forgive me if in my short life I have upset you in any way. Poor you... How could you have upset me? Come on, let's give the dead the last kiss. Truly, everything is emptiness. and this life is shadow and dream. Cover the cover. Death, don't rush me, because I can't part with Ion and the child. Good luck. So you will come. Don't worry, Ioane, because the dungeon is only for people, not for... Are you pleased for putting him in jail? But I've reconciled with him... I didn't want him. The Father... Why are you surprised? I came to see you. You're my son-in-law. How's the prison, Ion? How to be? Good. But do you still think at my daughter, from time to time? The truth is that I'm thinking at her. - So? - So what? God forgive her, it was her destiny. That's right, God forgive her. And forgive us if He could. I payed five scoundrels to let me in. They didn't let in Zenovia. How beautiful was your mother! Beautiful, but stupid. She married Glanetasu because he was handsome and sang at... that's why you didn't have anything. Lazy and stupid. And me? Am I stupid and lazy, too? You're not! That's why you have! Just don't let anything happen to the baby. What about the baby? He's not well. What? He is ill. He sleeps all the time, he doesn't eat. What can you do? You weaned him too soon. What's the matter? Yes, what am I, midwife? Ask your mom! What's the matter? Can't you hear? What's the matter? He is ill. Sir, man, if you (believe in) God, let me go! I report with obedience. Please, if you have God... I have six more days... what do you gain if I'll stay...? My baby is sick! My baby is sick! Back! I left you here and you drink and made a noise! Outside! Outside! Doctor, listen to me, a man like our Grofusor does not exist in all of Europe. If we had many like him... If we had a few more doctors, maybe it would be better. Less resounding, but better. Doctor, please, let me guide. You talk and.. What, do you want to kill my horse? It's a wonderful autumn, the harvest is announced to be rich... You know, you are wrong about Grofusoru. I'm not talking about his extraordinary ability, the praxis he has... but he got me out of jail, got me back on my feet. But can't we find another topic to discuss, sir? If someone bewitched Petrisor, please God, make him die. Make him stand five meters under the ground, he who trouble an innocent's soul You poisoned him with some strange food, bastards! Look, it smells like brandy! Maledetti! Not Grofsor, sir! Not Grofsor, sir! Not politicians, not lawyers Doctors, sir, doctors... Culture, sir! Someone would have bewitched him! That Judas of Savista who always wandered around here. Or that whore, Florica of Gheorghe who.. Don't hurt your mum, Ionica! Ionica, no! If you'd called me until it swelled, maybe I could have saved him. Now it's too late. We're stupid, sir... We're poor. You are gone too, grandpa's baby. Ioane, maybe we'll understand each other as decent people. You got tired in vain. Ana died, the child died. God forgive them both. We have nothing to do with each other, we are the same as in the beginning. Only that Ana and Petrisor are gone. Now, everything that was theirs should be returned to me and you'll live your own life, as lucky as you can be. Do you see that? Say, do you see it? Ion, I've never liked going to court, but now I won't forgive you! I don't forgive you, Ioane, even if I would sell my shirt! Folks, aren't you afraid of the good God? Get away from here, teacher, if not I'll hit you! You did everything but that... I wanted to tell you that by law the father inherits the baby's fortune, the same as the baby's inherits the father's, that's what I meant! So that you don't have to fight in vain! May God give you health and happiness! Baciu and Ion Pop of Glanetas, were fierce and relentless like two swords that don't fit in the same scabbard. And God, who tried so hard on both of them make them reason. So what did they do? They both bond as if, God forbid, they would perish without direct heirs that is, without children.. to leave all their wealth, which caused them much trouble to our holy church. Wonderful example from which one could learn. Florica! Woe is me, John! Where are you going in such a hurry, Florica? Don't make me stay, Gheorghe will kill me! I'm going to sell some pears because we need some money and Gheorghe won't even let me... What do you want, Ion? Rest a while. I am in a hurry. Really I am in a hurry. Why don't you want to rest? I am in a hurry, leave me alone. Ah, how stuffy... The heat melted me. It's cool here. Cool? You can see it's cool... Leave me.. You will still be mine. Mine! Even if I'll kill someone! When it was possible, you didn't want to. When you want, you can't. It's late now. Late? Late for whom? Too late. Hey, Gheorghe! My friend.. He's not at home. Where is he? He's not at home, he's at work with the workers. Or maybe you didn't know. Only on Sundays you find him at home, now with all the work to do. Maybe even on Sunday he is not at home. Sunday, after he leaves... I'll come. Do you sleep over there? Come in the garden, do you hear? Come out, otherwise... If he finds out, Gheorghe will kill us. He kill whoever else he killed. (He never kill anyone) Go out, if you don't go out... do you hear? Well, now, if you're still here... come in. Why? I'll give you something to drink. What is it, Savistie? Ion.. Ever since poor Avrum perished... this is no longer a wine cellar, it's a stable! What do you want? What I want... I want wine. You decided to work precisely on Sunday. I thought we would talk. Drink something. Sunday. That's how I decided. You always were stubborn. Like you, Ion. Like you. Then, Florica, take care of my mother because she's sick. Did you take the axes? I'll take them. Take care. Where do you sleep, in the house? Yes. Come on. What's wrong with you, boy? I don't know, Dad. I'm not well. I'm not well at all. I shall go home. Then wait. Let's go home, God forgive me. Ma cos'hai? I told you we shouldn't work on Holy Sunday! Go do as I said. Can't you hear I'm not feeling well? Florica.. You are? Me, who else? Don't you sleep? No. Why did you come back? I'm not very well. It's nothing. You go to bed. I'll be fine by tomorrow. Shall I turn off the lamp? No, let the light on. Florica, why? Why what? Florica..My Florica. Why aren't we lucky? God forbid, what's wrong with you? I'll giving you some brandy to soothe your heart. No. Doesn't matter. Looks like there's someone outside. Who could be? I'll go and see. Who is it? Who is it? Florica? Florica? Florica? What did you do? I die... like a dog... Is it known who killed him? Me. How did you kill him? With the hoe. Why? Because he came to my wife. It hit him in the head, but the bone was very strong, it just cracked. Instead, four completely broken ribs. A deadly blow, too. It's like something in me is dead. When he was little at school, he was keen on books. He wanted to become somebody through learning. Then the land, the passions... changed him and killed him. He died for his love. See, Florica, take care. because me.. who knows when I'll get back If it weren't for the woman, it wouldn't need justice. Good luck. The hoe, Judge... The hoe can become a weapon. A hint? Not at all, an observation. He was a man like steel. He could live 100 years. But what shall we do with the dead? What? Bury him and that's it! This boy wanted to be master of his life at all costs. We didn't know how to show him what he really could be like. Life is never to blame, dear boy. The people are to blame when they don't know what to do with it. Don't forget, please. Dad... Let's stop talking. For our Ion. For all that he could be. He fought in vain for the land. Two meters. Now, we don't go to court anymore. The one above will judge him. So the fortune should go back to me. No, the land belongs to the holy church. And if you're a bastard and a drunkard, I'll kick you out of the house, you know!
