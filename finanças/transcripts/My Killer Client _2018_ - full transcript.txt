Wow! Baby, these are beautiful, but they look expensive. ‐ They are, which is why we don't get to keep them, we're just picking out your favorites for the wedding. ‐ I see. ‐ I don't know, you've just been working so hard lately. I just wanna do something nice for you, bring the flowers to you. ‐ Oh, so fun and so cute, you're my favorite. I should hope so. ‐ Okay. Hmm, getting hints of 1995 bath soaps. ‐ Let's see. Wow, nailed it. Smells just like my grandma's bathroom. ‐ Brings me back. ‐ Yeah, but do we want that for like our entire wedding, honestly? ‐ Yeah, no. Okay, we gotta get on this 'cause our wedding's like in a month, so, come on. ‐ Okay, well I vote that you do it because I'm a software programmer who knows absolutely nothing about flowers. ‐ You're such a cute software programmer. ‐ You're sweet. ‐ So cute. Thanks babe. I'll be right back. ‐ Okay. I like pink flowers, I like the red flowers. You sure you don't like the length? It goes perfectly with your eyes. ‐ It's too shiny or something. ‐ Well, it's matte actually, but... ‐ I want your dress. ‐ Oh, this is a one off. ‐ I wanna look like Brigitte Bardot. ‐ Really? Because in the consult‐‐ ‐ Bardot is fabulous. Make me look like her. How about you try this on? ‐ Hmm, thanks hon. ‐ Mmm, she's a treat. ‐ I need all the clients I can get. ‐ I just hate seeing my bestie get trampled on by these entitled hoity‐toity pseudo‐celebrities. ‐ I am working on it. ‐ She's on the money about that dress though. Always been a crowd pleaser. ‐ It's really beautiful. Sorry, I didn't mean to butt in but it's just so flattering on you. Thank you. ‐ I couldn't help but overhear you with that woman. Are you like a personal shopper or something? ‐ Personal shopper, stylist, that's me. ‐ Cool, I mean I've sort of been looking for someone to help me because... Well I mean I could use a little makeover. ‐ Unique is good. Yeah, unique's great. ‐ You don't wanna look like everyone else. ‐ Oh no, I do. I really do. I mean, unique is fine, but like, I wanna feel respected. ‐ Well I think the universe has brought us together. I have to check my schedule, but I'm Christa. ‐ I'm Kat. ‐ This is Lindsay. This is her boutique. She has the best selection in the city. ‐ Yeah, we make sure Christa's clients always get a good deal. ‐ Okay. And by the way, that's Rose, our in‐house tailor in the event something doesn't fit perfectly. ‐ Nice to meet you. ‐ You too. This is awesome, this is really exciting. I like this one. It's like I'm channeling Audrey Hepburn. ‐ One second. Well Audrey Hepburn it is. Rose, can you just lift the hem a little bit just right here? Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing. ‐ Yeah, we're good. ‐ Gorgeous. Stop hating me. Okay, just gentle hands. ‐ It went in two inches. Yeah I was gonna say fix this. ‐ Okay, just stop touching my shoulder, okay? Just, you can look at it. Excuse me, Christa, can I borrow you for a minute? ‐ Okay, bye. Oh really? Yeah I do, actually. ‐ Here you go, lattes. ‐ Thank you. ‐ So tell me about you. ‐ Ah well, let's see. Um, I started a nonprofit organization. It's a place where people with aggression and anxiety issues can come and feel safe. I love it and it's my life but I just feel like I need to focus on myself for a second. ‐ It sounds like you deserve it. ‐ Where did you get this dress? Because it's just so special. ‐ It is a one off from Paris. ‐ Do you think I could wear that dress? Not, you know, your dress, like a dress like your dress. ‐ Of course, but the problem is I'm a little busy with Elise and I have my wedding in three weeks. So can you wait a month? ‐ I was just, I have an event that I sort of need some help with. ‐ I could see you in April, and if someone cancels then you will be first on my list. ‐ Sure of course, I know. You're busy. I mean who knows, maybe Elise'll get cramps taking so many selfies and then your time will free up or something. ‐ Oh, um, my fiancé's gonna be here any minute, I'm so sorry. ‐ Your fiancé's coming here now? ‐ Yes. ‐ Oh, yeah I actually have to get going myself. But it was so nice talking to you. ‐ So nice to meet you. Thank you so much. Sure I'll see you soon. ‐ Yes, bye. ‐ Hi, beautiful. ‐ Hi, handsome. ‐ Ooh, babe, this dress. ‐ Ugh, why does everyone say this about this dress, it's just a dress. ‐ I know something about it. I wanna marry it. Mmm. ‐ Not without the woman inside, of course. ‐ That reminds me, I have to get it a few inches shorter because it's like all the rage. Oh hey. ‐ Hey. ‐ So I ran into a realtor friend of mine who showed me...this. ‐ Okay, fire her immediately. ‐ Just a girl can dream, okay? Just use your imagination. A little bit of TLC and this could be the most sublime headquarters for Glam Up Girl. ‐ Okay. Give me a minute. Yeah, I can see it has potential. What do they want for it? ‐ It's been on the market for two years ‐ so they're motivated. ‐ That's a plus. ‐ Okay, so just imagine this is the boutique. This is Glam Up Girl, okay? So over here, I'm going to drink Rose with my clients as we peruse over fabrics. And over here is going to be the beautiful dressing room with gold linen curtains. And you'll like this part. Here is where you'll have a play area for our babies. ‐ Our babies? Okay, I'm in, sign me up. ‐ I'm going to keep my job, and then I'm gonna save money, save money. Save money and tada! ‐ I think I'm marrying the smartest, sexiest, most talented stylist in America. You were born to make people look good, babe. ‐ I think your mom would like it. I think she will. ‐ I'm gonna build an empire, one stylish woman at a time. ‐ God, I love you. ‐ Good, 'cause you're marrying me. I love you too. Okay, should we look at this? ‐ Yeah, let's do it. ‐ Okay, so this one has got like 19 windows and all the light... ‐ Good morning, ladies. ‐ Good morning, Elise. ‐ Where's my dress? ‐ It is in the dressing room, if you just... ‐ I'm sorry. ‐ No. Luckily... ‐ I'm sorry. ‐ Let's talk about nice things. Um, how are you? ‐ Oh, I'm great. ‐ She's just taking a bit, can you give me one second? ‐ Good luck. ‐ Elise. Oh my god, Elise, Elise? Rose, call 911! Elise, Elise, can you hear me? Elise, Elise! Elise, Elise. Elise, can you hear me? Elise, hello, can you hear me? Elise, Elise! ‐ Thank you. ‐ I mean they think that she had a heart attack. ‐ That's absolutely horrible. I'm sorry. ‐ You have no idea, Jake. I thought she was dead. You think she's gonna be okay? ‐ I don't know. I don't know. I mean I pray that she is. I feel so bad for ever saying a negative word about her. And can you please not tell your mom because I'm sure she'll find a way to blame me and make some jab about me not being able to keep a client, so, please. ‐ My mom's not that bad. Besides, there's nothing you could have done. She's gonna be fine. ‐ I hope so, I hope so. I am still completely shaken up over what happened to Elise. ‐ It's a blessing. Believe me, she's not a nice person. Please forgive me. ‐ You can't say that. ‐ It's true. Hi. ‐ Hi guys. ‐ Oh, hi. ‐ I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. ‐ How did you? ‐ Oh Rose. Rose, the tailor. ‐ But, sorry, she was, um... she was here. ‐ Right, yeah no I had to get a skirt altered, so I dropped it off and she was talking about it with a customer. ‐ Oh. ‐ I'm sorry, I‐‐ ‐ No problem. ‐ I just, I wanted to drop these off to you. I feel so awful at what you must be going through. ‐ It's just terrible, you know. I just haven't slept and I can't stop thinking about it, but anyway... ‐ But look on the bright side. You get to work with Kat now, right? ‐ Lindsay. ‐ Sorry. ‐ No, no, no, it's okay. No, no rush, no pressure. I'm surprised you're even here. I would have thought you would have taken a day off or... ‐ Yeah, that's what I said. Take a day off, day to hang by the pool, do your totally lame Fit by Fiona video. We all know how much you love Fit by Fiona, which is a cult, by the way. ‐ Well I mean since you're sleepy, maybe I could take you to get the world's best latte? ‐ That sounds so good. ‐ Is that okay if I steal her for a little? ‐ Oh, of course. ‐ Really, okay! Well, yes! ‐ Oh let me grab the flowers. ‐ Thanks. ‐ It's such a good spot, you'll love it. ‐ Have fun. Oh it's just right around the corner. It's fine, you know it's been around forever. I can't believe I've never been here before. I love this. ‐ What, why are you smiling like that? ‐ I don't know, I just, I feel better and thank you. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Double cheers. ‐ You can never have too many, right? Who knows, maybe we can help each other. ‐ Done. So, how long have you been working with Lindsay? ‐ We have been best friends forever. In fact, she's the one who introduced me to my fiancé's mom who I used to work for a few years back. So yeah, I used to work for Jake's mom. She's a gazillionaire clothing designer. Mary Walsh Designs. ‐ I don't know her. ‐ She's massive. So I met Jake through her. And I think she regrets it to this day. ‐ Don't take it personally though. She's probably just really jealous of you. ‐ Mmmm, I think she just hates me. ‐ And she doesn't know you. But Jake does. And he is amazing. I mean from like everything you've told me. Clearly he sounds great. ‐ Yeah, he's awesome. ‐ And he loves you so much, and, you're really lucky. You both are really lucky. ‐ Hmm. ‐ Anyway, so now that I have your ear, how did you get into the personal shopping biz? I feel like you know everything about fashion. ‐ I think it's more about style than fashion and I think you know, fashion comes and goes and style is forever. ‐ Okay so it's kind of like a fiery summer fling versus your one true love. ‐ I like that analogy, I'm stealing it. ‐ It is yours, but only if I can steal your style. ‐ Cheers, done. ‐ It is so weird. I don't either. Teamwork makes the dream work, right? Oh I wanna check out those dresses though before I go. ‐ Yes, up there on the right. ‐ Awesome. Linds, I love your store. ‐ Thank you. And I love your socks. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Was that completely necessary? ‐ Really long coffee. ‐ I know, sorry. What's going on? Nothing. ‐ Are you jealous? ‐ Not at all. You guys just seem to be getting really chummy really fast. ‐ Linds, you are my best friend. You're like family. ‐ Okay. ‐ Okay? ‐ You're right. ‐ You and me. Lucky to have you. My girl, you know it. ‐ Jesus, hey Christa, you gave me a heart attack. ‐ Sorry, babe. ‐ Didn't think you were getting in. So how was your day? ‐ It was good, yeah. My new client got me some flowers because of Elise, so, it was nice. ‐ That is sweet. ‐ Linds was kind of jealous though which is weird 'cause she's not the jealous type, so I don't know. ‐ Well you're like the cool girl in high school. Everyone wants to be your BFF. Own it, babe. ‐ What was that? ‐ Stay here. ‐ No, I'm coming with you. ‐ No, stay here. ‐ No I'm coming with you. ‐ Keep behind me. I don't see anyone back there. What do you wanna do? Nothing, let's go in the house. I don't want you out here alone. Jake. Someone threw a rock through the window. ‐ Why would someone do that? It's supposed to be a safe neighborhood. ‐ Kids, I don't know, honey. Better a rock than a burglar though. You okay? ‐ Yeah. ‐ I'm gonna call the police. ‐ No, just, it's probably kids just like you said. Let it go. We can watch a movie or something. Yeah, let's do that. Come on. I hope you've had a good night's sleep 'cause this is going to be a big day! ‐ Oh, that makes me nervous, should I be nervous? ‐ No, you should be excited. ‐ Okay. ‐ Yeah. ‐ I trust you. ‐ You should. ‐ Great. Things, rules‐‐anything I should know, remember? ‐ Yes. No black pants with brown belts. ‐ Okay. ♪ Walk straight into the room ♪ ‐ No tights with open toed shoes. That's a big one. ♪ Chock full of attitude ♪ ‐ Okay. ‐ Vertical stripes only if any. ‐ Okay. ♪ And I gotta stop ♪ ♪ Just showing off ♪ ‐ Absolutely, one hundred percent! ♪ Just show it off ♪ ‐ But, be prepared. Yes! ♪ Go go go go show it off ♪ Yes. Yes. ‐ It's like very, like... ♪ Don't ever let this feeling stop ♪ ‐ This is for you to feel confident. ‐ Ooh, I like this. I feel famous. Wow. I mean, I kind of feel like Wonder Woman in these. They are sublime. Do you wear boots like this? ‐ Yes, when I'm busy taking over the world. Okay, so the walk is really important. So you could put your chin up like this, relax your shoulders. Okay, really tight in here. Now I want you to walk effortless. Powerfully but effortless. ‐ Got it. ‐ Okay. What are you doing? ‐ Sorry, sorry I was just watching your walk. ‐ No, Kat, this is about you, okay? Find your confidence. Where do you feel good about yourself? Is it the top, the boots, do you feel different in this outfit? ‐ I do. I do, I feel dangerous. Like I could get anything I want. ‐ One second, I just have to get it. ‐ Oh yeah. ‐ Oh. Hi. Yes, I'm gonna come home and cook the spaghetti that your mom likes, the only thing she's approved. Just kidding, sort of. Um yes, I love you also, I'll speak to you soon. Okay, bye. Sorry, I have a late lunch with monster mother in law. Sorry, that was terrible. ‐ You know what, I have an idea. It's time to do something for you. ‐ What? ‐ You shall see. Come on, we'll go. Get your purse. Come on, out the door. Get get. ‐ You're lying. Oh this place is incredible. And, this is what I'd like you to see. You can just look at everything on this table. ‐ Oh my gosh, this is so special, wow. ‐ Oh my gosh, try it on. ‐ You think so? ‐ Yes, try it on. Oh Christa, it's beautiful on you. We do have matching earrings. ‐ Ooh, matching earrings? The matching earrings because it would be a crime to separate these two. And think about it, no one else will have them. It's a total one off. ‐ Actually, we have multiple sets of the earrings but yes the necklace is one of a kind. ‐ I just promised Lindsay I would go wedding jewelry shopping with her. I don't think that‐‐ ‐ I don't think Lindsay would want you to risk losing something you love obviously as much as you love this necklace. I mean that would be kind of selfish, right? ‐ Yeah of course, I didn't mean anything. ‐ Okay then she'll understand. And if she doesn't, what kind of friend is she anyway? ‐ Ma'am? Hi, I'm gonna get the necklace and the earrings. ‐ Yes! ‐ Thank you. ‐ You're welcome. ‐ Hi. ‐ Hi. ‐ Christa found her wedding jewelry! ‐ Kat! ‐ Oh. Sorry, I... But come on, she's gonna be thrilled. We have to show her, she's your best friend. ‐ I'm sorry, we saw this cute little store and I know that we said that‐‐ ‐ That I would go shopping for wedding jewelry with you? ‐ You're mad, I feel awful. ‐ Oh, wow, look at that, gorgeous. Congratulations. I'm glad you ladies had a great time. ‐ See? ‐ What about you? Did you buy anything? ‐ Me? Yeah, you didn't get anything? ‐ Oh, no, no, no, I didn't get anything. It was all about Christa. Okay, I actually have to get going but thank you so much. You are such a genius. ‐ Oh, hardly. ‐ I'll see you soon. ‐ Bye Kat. ‐ Bye Lindsay. ‐ Linds. I'm sorry. ‐ It's fine. Really, it's fine. It's just, you know, I wanna do cool stuff like that with you. And Kat's kind of, you know, like when a stalker likes a celebrity, it's kind of like that. ‐ She's harmless. ‐ Hmm, we'll see. ‐ I better go, I'm gonna have a late lunch with the in‐laws. ‐ Oh, good luck with that. ‐ Thanks. Let me know if you need me. ‐ I do. Bye. ‐ Bye. Kat Niven, hmm. We'll see about you. Some bread if anyone wants it. ‐ You guys did a great job with the Bolognese. Unless there's a Tuscan chef hiding in the kitchen. ‐ Oh thank you, Jake and I took a Italian‐‐ ‐ You know, honey, you remember my mother's Bolognese, don't you? You could not get enough of that, do you remember? ‐ Yeah, mom, I remember. ‐ So how's the fall fashion line coming along? ‐ Ah, may I? She outdid herself this year. Another level. The fashion show won't know what hit them. ‐ We are going to do a secret location this year. On the day of, the guests will receive the text giving them the address and the time. You know, keeps it more exclusive and mysterious. Now I can expect you there, right darling? Hmm? ‐ We want you both to be there. ‐ Well, of course we do. ‐ Yeah mom, we'll both be there. ‐ So, how's your new business doing? ‐ Christa just got a new client. ‐ Oh, did she find you on Craigslist? Darling, if you would just cough up enough money to install a qualified business manager, you might have a chance. Otherwise, you're just a fashionista for hire. ‐ Mother, that's enough. ‐ A fashionista for hire? I mean I'm trying with your mom, Jake but she's not making it easy. ‐ My mom has despised every woman I've ever been with. She treats me like I'm 13 years old. But she's my mom so what am I gonna say? Maybe she's just jealous of you. ‐ Yeah, no. Wealthy people are not jealous of regular people, so, she just hates me. ‐ So then let me talk to her. ‐ No, I can handle this. I can deal with that, I'm not gonna say it. ‐ You can say it. I won't tell. ‐ I want to crack her. ‐ Oh yeah? I have no doubt that you will. ‐ I'm gonna crack her. Just you wait and see. ‐ Do you have any idea how happy you make me? ‐ No. ‐ We're gonna have like 8,000 babies. ‐ 8,000 babies, that's a lot of babies. ‐ I'm gonna be the coolest stay at home dad you've ever seen. ‐ Stay home dad? ‐ Just watch. ‐ You should be working for these 8,000 babies. I do, I work at home. ‐ I love you. ‐ I love you too. ‐ Christa? Oh. ‐ Lindsay, hi, what are you doing here? ‐ Oh, you dropped these at my boutique. I thought I'd return them to you. ‐ Thank you. ‐ I thought you didn't buy anything. ‐ Did I say that? ‐ Mhmm. ‐ You know, I do so much shopping I really can't keep track of everything I buy. ‐ Is this your new look? ‐ It's cute, right? Christa picked it out for me. ‐ Reminds me of hers. And your bun and the video and everything. ‐ Well you know, I literally just threw this up without thinking. Christa didn't invent the top bun. And newsflash, half the people in the world do Fit by Fiona. ‐ Right. Right. And those earrings. I'm sure you have a receipt for them. ‐ I'm sorry, are you trespassing on my property to accuse me of a crime you're assuming I committed? I bought a matching pair. It was supposed to be a surprise because, and I know this makes you jealous, Lindsay, but Christa is my friend. ‐ She's actually your personal shopper and you're her client. This is ridiculous. I don't even know why I'm arguing with some‐‐ ‐ Then leave. ‐ Excuse me? ‐ Get off of my property right now. ‐ You know what? I don't know what you're up to but I'm gonna find out. ‐ Bye. ‐ It was weird. I walked into the backyard and it was like I was staring at you. Like, like your twin. Come on, Lindsay, I think you're exaggerating a little. I am not exaggerating. You were not there. I am telling you, it was very weird. She had on the same clothes, everything. ‐ I picked those clothes out for her. ‐ Okay, it's not just the clothes. The hair, your workout video that we just happened to be talking about. ‐ She is insecure. I mean I don't know, maybe she has to be me to try to figure out who she is. Insecure is one thing, but this was another. I'm telling you, she is a dangerous person. I mean come on, have you ever known me to be so pushy about something? I really don't understand why you're defending her. You don't even know her. Christa, what if she does something really serious? I can't believe you don't believe me. ‐ But the fact that you went to her house, that's weird. Lindsay, that's weird, it's a little stalkery. ‐ Okay come on, I have to return the earrings that she stole by the way. ‐ You don't know that. But I can't lose her as a client, okay? I can't pay for half the wedding. I can't ask my mother in law. ‐ Okay I get that, I do. ‐ But I agree, she's different. She's quirky. ‐ Quirky? She's obsessed with you. How do you not see this? It's like she's in love with you or something. ‐ You are my best friend. ‐ I am not worried about that. Yeah, okay, admittedly I was a little jealous but there's something off about her. I really, I don't trust her. ‐ Look at me. Thank you. And I'm not worried. ‐ I'm worried. ‐ I got this. ‐ I'm not sure that you do. I gotta go okay. Just please let me know if you need anything at all, okay? I love you. ‐ Love you. ‐ If you could just finish up that ring display, that'd be great. Hey guys, I have an appointment to get to. Rose'll help take care of the store. ‐ Okay. So, what do you think? ‐ I kind of feel like Cinderella. Yeah, you see how they lengthen your legs? ‐ And you would wear these, right? ‐ Oh yeah, I have them in the silver and the gold. ‐ Good. ‐ But you know this is about you, right? This is about individuality and it's your process. It has nothing to do with me, okay? ‐ That settles it, I'm taking them. Did you hear what I said? ‐ I did. Of course I did. Ooh, I really want you to meet my boyfriend. ‐ Oh. You have a boyfriend. ‐ Did I not tell you? Oh, yeah, yeah, no, he's great. He's a doctor and he went to John Hopkins and he actually really reminds me a lot of Jake. But just from, you know, all the wonderful things you told me about him, he seemed so perfect. I mean except for his mother. ‐ I wouldn't disagree with that. ‐ So a double date then? Tonight, let's do it tonight! ‐ I'll have to ask Jake. ‐ Okay great, no great. I'll have my assistant make a reservation for seven at Belmont, have you been there? ‐ No, I‐‐ ‐ Okay, it's great. You'll love it, it's delicious. ‐ We have an hour left if you wanna finish. ‐ Oh no, I actually have to get downtown but I will see you tonight. It'll be sublime! ‐ Okay then. ‐ Lindsay, you know this is not a good idea. This is really not a good idea, Lindsay. Lindsay, what are you up to? ‐ What are you doing with Jake Walsh? You are just crazy, what? Damn. ‐ You really shouldn't break into people's houses. ‐ Hey Chris. Going out of town for a few days. Kisses. ‐ This looks stunning. Thank you so much. ‐ You have two inches off, have you been doing your Pilates? I have. ‐ Rose should be doing this, not me. ‐ Oh, it's beautiful, thank you. ‐ Okay, hold on one second. Hey Kat, what's up? Can you give me a second? ‐ Oh no worries, not a problem. ‐ So unfortunately, my assistant couldn't get us seven o'clock reservations and the only availability they really had was at 9:30 which is totally too late. So I was thinking since it's such a nice day, how about a late lunch? You have a cute yard, right? ‐ I do. ‐ Okay, well I don't wanna be a bother but what if we just came over there? You don't have to cook. We can order pizza and I'll make dessert and bring some wine. ‐ Kat, I just have so much to do for my wedding and I just... ‐ Well you have to eat, right? ‐ True, but I just. ‐ Okay, exactly. So I will see you soon. Oh, should I bring a bathing suit? You have a pool, right? ‐ Bring your bathing suit. ‐ Yay, I'm so excited. ‐ I mean I couldn't say no because she is so persuasive. ‐ Well then let's just make the best of it. And from everything you told me, she sounds fun. ‐ Yeah I mean she's a little strange, you know, but, I do like her. ‐ Well, then sounds like I'll like her too. Must be her. ‐ Hi guys. ‐ Kitty? ‐ Jake? Oh my god, Jake Walsh? ‐ What, you guys know each other? ‐ Jake and I went to high school together. God I haven't thought about you in a million years but wow, you have grown up. I barely even recognized you. That is so wild. I can't believe we haven't connected the dots until right now. Oh, this makes me sad, I really wanted you guys to meet Michael, my boyfriend. But I mean he got stuck at work, because of some doctors hours. It's just me, is that okay? ‐ Of course, yeah, come in. Really, okay. ‐ Thank you for the pie. ‐ Of course. Excuse me, Jake. How amazing! Oh I hope you like quiche pie. ‐ Oh yes. Your pool is amazing! Make yourself at home. Woo! ‐ Christa, I need to talk to you. I had no idea your client Kat was Kitty. The crazy girl I dated in high school. ‐ This Kat? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Come on guys, get in. The water is so nice. ‐ Not right now. ‐ Ooh, let's do a handstand contest. Yeah, mine's really good. Ready, ready? ‐ Maybe she's changed. Tada! ‐ That's the pizza. ‐ Good handstand. It's great. ‐ Come on, guys! ‐ Come on. If you would have told me that a month ago I would be wearing gold sparkly heels, I would have laughed in your face. Honestly though, Christa, working with you has transformed me into the best possible version of myself. I feel like a completely different person. ‐ Yeah, yeah, no that's great. ‐ Mmm, can I use your restroom? ‐ Yes, it is down the hall to the right. ‐ Oh, BRB. ‐ Can you stop, please? Everything is going great, and after this, I will make sure that I keep it purely professional. ‐ I haven't even told you about prom. I broke up with the girl months before, she still showed up. I tried to defend her because I felt bad but then she strangled me. She's crazy. She can't be your client. ‐ Well she is my client so we are going to have to deal with it. ‐ Even after what I just told you about prom? That's not the point. The point is she's not well and you are enabling her. How well Jake, I mean how many girls have lost their minds over a guy at prom? She's in the house, so can we just talk about this later, please? Thank you. ‐ I don't think you understand. It wasn't a small crush. She was‐‐ ‐ Anyone for dessert? ‐ I'm good. ‐ Jake, it was 15 years ago. I mean people change. They turn corners. I mean she founded a charity that deals with the issues that she's fixing. ‐ She attacked me. ‐ Oh come on, you're being slightly dramatic, she attacked you. ‐ No, she literally dragged me across a lawn. Jeez. ‐ She just texted me. I'm guessing Jake told you about the institution. I'm sorry, you must be weirded out. Come by the foundation, give me a chance to explain. ‐ Fine. Go talk to her. ‐ What? ‐ See what she has to say. Look. I know you need this. You lost Elise and I know that you're worried about proving yourself to my mom. ‐ I don't want your mom to think I'm a failure. ‐ I know. So go. ‐ You sure? ‐ Just this once. See what she has to say and promise me that you're going to have your phone on you literally the entire time, okay? ‐ Thank you. ‐ And this is our communal area. They can be on the computers and then we have like a play station over there. I know right, it's cute. Okay, look, I'm sorry about what happened. I know it was super strange for you and for Jake. I mean it was super strange for me too. ‐ It was definitely unexpected. ‐ I was a completely different person in high school. I'm sure Jake told you about the institution. ‐ Yeah, yeah. ‐ But no, it's a good thing, it's good because it inspired me to wanna do all this and help others, and I don't know, I mean this foundation won't even exist if I didn't go through all that. Though I suppose it was uncomfortable for you to be around someone Jake had feelings for. ‐ What do you mean? ‐ Why I mean I know it was a million years ago but, you know those first loves. They're hard to let go of. ‐ I'm not threatened by Jake's past. ‐ Oh, nor should you be. ‐ He's never given me a reason not to trust him. ‐ Of course not, he's great. ‐ So I've gotta go, I gotta taste test some cakes with Jake's mom. ‐ Good luck with that. Hey Christa. ‐ Yeah? I'm really glad we got to talk. Hey you've called Lindsay, leave a message. ‐ One sec. Hey Linds, it's me. I got your text and, now you're MIA so I guess we're not going on our midday run together. Can you just call me please? I know you're mad and I am so sorry. I just think you're right about Kat. Something is just off about her. So just, I love you, call me. Ooh. This looks good. ‐ I'm gonna get you some water and I'll be right back. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Thank you for coming. ‐ Well I figured if I'm going to eat we might as well just have the best pastry chef in town and that's Chef Mohommad, so. ‐ Well thank you for being here and it means a lot to me. So I wanted to ask you a question. Do you remember a girl named Kitty, she and Jake went to school together. ‐ Kitty Niven, of course I know her. ‐ You know she was institutionalized, right? ‐ Yeah I do, poor girl. But you know, people change. ‐ Hi. ‐ Um, hi. What are you doing here? ‐ I think I left my pie plate here. Duh, Kat, right? I'm so forgetful sometimes. ‐ Yeah, okay, let me check. ‐ I'll get it. I think I know exactly where I left it. Found it. ‐ Um, she attacked your son. ‐ Christa, I love my son more than I love myself and that is saying something but Jake does have a tendency to exaggerate a little bit. You know her father owns a pharmaceutical company. Kitty is loaded. ‐ I wondered where she got all her money from. ‐ You know it's funny that you mention her because Kitty was generous enough to offer us her Foundation as the locale for our fall fashion show. But don't tell anyone. You will get the address on the day just like everybody else. ‐ I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your day. ‐ It's fine. ‐ Really? ‐ Anyway, I have to go meet Christa. ‐ I mean, you don't have to do anything. It's not like you said your vows yet. ‐ What are you saying? ‐ I know you've missed me, Jake. ‐ Okay, I think it's time for you to go. ‐ It's okay. It's been a long time, I get it, it's a lot to process for you. ‐ Actually, Kitty, or Kat or whatever persona you're going by these days, I processed this a long time ago, you understand? Didn't work then, it's not gonna work now. ‐ Oh, how do you know that? Because I'm in love with my fiancée. My god, what's wrong with you? ‐ There is nothing wrong with me. ‐ What? ‐ Yeah, she called me just the other day and suggested we partner on the event which is perfect for us because we love supporting charities. Mm, so how's the dress coming? ‐ Excuse me, sorry? ‐ Your wedding dress? Is it finished yet? ‐ Ah yeah, I'm, gonna see the tailor this afternoon. ‐ Oh. Then perhaps I ought to finish the cake. ‐ Kat, I didn't mean that, I'm sorry. Look, I know you're a good person on the inside. ‐ Yeah, I am a good person. But apparently not good enough for you, Jake. ‐ That's not what I meant. ‐ Have fun with Christa. She's pushy, Jake, but she's not crazy. ‐ It's not pushy. Like she literally came into our house and was hitting on me. I promise you, she was being crazy. It's like she wanted to start our relationship all over again. I'm telling you, Christa, it was weird, okay? It just doesn't make any sense, Jake. It doesn't make any sense at all. That's what I'm saying to you. What, she's just like hitting on you now? ‐ I know. But I told you, she's troubled, she always has been. ‐ Then why did you go out with her, Jake? ‐ I don't know, I guess I just felt sorry for her. ‐ Oh you felt sorry for her? Huh, is that a good foundation for a relationship, Jake? What, do you feel sorry for me, is that why you're marrying me? ‐ Okay, don't be ridiculous. Babe. ‐ Just, can you just not for a second, please? ‐ Hey. Why don't we not let her do this to us because I'm guessing this is exactly what she wanted. ‐ But why? ‐ I don't know, maybe she's obsessed with me, not you. I know, it sounds crazy, it was forever ago but she's really not well. ‐ I just feel so stupid. ‐ Don't. You just see the best in people. That's one of the reasons I absolutely love you. ‐ What are we gonna do? ‐ I guess we just ignore her? I mean I was empathetic to her in high school but look what that got me. My own personal stalker. ‐ By the way, your mother is having the fashion show at Kat's foundation. ‐ What? ‐ She didn't tell you? ‐ No, she didn't tell me. ‐ Well Kat's gonna be there. ‐ Of course she is. ‐ Why is she doing this, Jake? Why is she invading our lives? ‐ I don't know. Hello, can I help you? Are you okay, miss? ‐ I'm fine. ‐ Well, you seem upset. Did something happen? ‐ I don't know what you're talking about but I'm fine, thank you. ‐ Oh anyway, 'cause earlier there was some glass in the street out here and I just heard a noise. Do you have any idea what's happening? ‐ Nope, no I don't. Again, I am fine. ‐ That's strange because I mean, I heard the noise and I came out here, it sounded like it came from somewhere around where your car's parked now. Are you sure you didn't see or hear anything? ‐ Are you accusing me of something? Because you know, I was just leaving my friend's house and was trying to go home and I'm sitting here and then you knock on my window and scare the crap out of me and start asking me a bunch of questions that I have no idea what you're talking about. ‐ Look, I did not mean to offend you. We just like to sort of keep an eye on each other around here. ‐ You know what, I'm so sorry. That was very rude of me, you're right, you're just trying to be a good neighbor and I'm really, I'm fine. I'm good, I'm just, I'm gonna head home. ‐ All right, well I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. ‐ And I didn't mean to snap at you. ‐ Okay. ‐ Such a good neighbor. So long. ‐ Hey Linds, it's me. You haven't called me back. I hope you're not mad at me, so, just please call me back. Bye. Hi. ‐ Hi. ‐ Is Rose here? ‐ Oh, she's not here today. ‐ Oh, you must be new, I'm Christa Bright. She was altering a red dress for me I'm picking up today. ‐ Red dress? I feel terrible. ‐ Why? ‐ A woman came in earlier this morning asking for the red dress. She claimed to be Miss Bright. ‐ That's impossible. ‐ I'm so sorry, I'm sure there's some kind of explanation for this. ‐ Because I'm Miss Bright, okay? ‐ I realize that now. She said she lost her ticket card at the car wash. ‐ You gave her my dress? ‐ Miss Bright, I'm so sorry. I'm sure we can find you another dress. ‐ There isn't another dress. What did she look like? ‐ Excuse me? ‐ The woman who came in here, what did she look like? ‐ Well, she looked like you. ‐ Of course it was her, Jake. She said she looked exactly like me. ‐ Babe, I believe you. But we don't have any proof. So it'd be silly to go to the police right now. ‐ Okay well if she took the dress, which she obviously did, then it's at her house, right? Christa, I don't know. Well you know her, Jake. ‐ I'll wear it for you, Jake. I know it's your favorite. ‐ You know she would do this. ‐ I bet you wanna kiss me right now, don't you? I understand you're upset. Let's just try to think this through. ‐ You did not just say that. You are so bad. Do you think my dress could be in her house? ‐ Possibly, yeah. ‐ Okay, so maybe someone could talk to her, preferably a police officer. I mean she was at the boutique, right, she could be a witness. She could be a witness into Elise's death. ‐ Christa, where are you going with this? ‐ Victor. ‐ Like my dad's friend Victor Ramirez? ‐ Please. ‐ I don't know. ‐ You said your dad could call it in for anything, Jake. ‐ Yeah, but this is‐‐ ‐ But this is important, this isn't just about a dress. She is messing with us. She's been messing with us for so long, Jake. Babe. Just why can't you see that? Listen babe, I told you she wasn't well. I just don't understand. ‐ I don't know. ‐ But Jake, Lindsay never trusted her and there's a reason. ‐ What do you want me to ask him exactly? ‐ He can pop by Kat's house, okay? Say he's investigating an incident. Keep it vague and maybe he thinks that she has some information. ‐ Oh, who's this devious woman I'm about to marry? ‐ I have to trust my gut, okay? ‐ Hi Mary. You ready for the big night? ‐ I mean maybe she will give up some information if she's pressured. Please. ‐ Okay. I'll make a call. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Oh my god, hardly. These things always throw me into a bit of a panic. But that is never to be repeated. ‐ Your secret's safe with me. Besides, I'm gonna make sure this night goes off without a hitch. Oh, I prepared a speech by the way. I think you will definitely enjoy it. ‐ Oh, well I have no doubt. And thank you again darling, for your generous contribution. Really, and the venue, it's perfect. It couldn't be more marvelous. ‐ I am just happy everything worked out. Jake is going to be there, right? ‐ Well, he better be. If he's not, he's got me to deal with. That should be motivation enough, don't you think? ‐ Most definitely. I just know how much he loves and respects you. As do I. You've always felt like family to me. ‐ Well, I'm glad you feel that way and thank you again, darling. Really, it couldn't be more perfect but I gotta run. So I'll see you later tonight, okay? Kiss kiss. ‐ Check. Hey you've called Lindsay. Leave a message. ‐ Hey Linds, it's me. Um, where are you? I haven't heard from you in two days and you won't call me back, so I am going to come over and you better have a good excuse why you haven't called your best friend in 48 hours. ‐ Really? Don't have time for this. Awesome, awesome. Can I help you? ‐ I'm Detective Ramirez. There was an incident earlier today that seems you may have some information that can help us resolve the issue. You mind if I come in? ‐ You know, I was actually just about to get dressed. ‐ It'll only take a minute. ‐ Okay, yeah. But can we make it quick? I have to finish my makeup and I have this very important evening. ‐ You have my word. ‐ Great. Come on in. Appreciate it. ‐ Really? I'm sorry, I just, I find it very odd that someone would accuse me of stealing a used dress from a tailor of all people. I don't know if you know this but my father is Allen Niven of Lavexis Pharmaceuticals. I'm sure you've heard of it. I've seen the commercials. ‐ You have, okay, so you know that I am not the kind of person who really needs to steal anything. Nor would I ever jeopardize my father's reputation over a secondhand red dress. I actually don't even wear red because it's like a really bold color and I'm just, I'm far more understated. So is there anything else? ‐ Well there was some suspicious details on the heart attack of a Miss Elise Wick. Do you know her? ‐ No, no, I can't say that I do. ‐ So you weren't in the boutique on the 11th of this month? ‐ I just said I don't know anything about that. Sorry, I'm just, I'm in a rush and I would really like to finish getting ready and get out of here, so are we good? ‐ Yeah we're good. Actually, do you mind if I use the restroom? ‐ Of course, yeah, it's down the hall and to the left. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Jake, why aren't you picking up your phone? I'm extremely worried about Lindsay at this point. It has been two days and she is nowhere to be found and I have a feeling that Kat has something to do with this and it's my fault so I'm going to Kat's house. I am done, I am going to confront her, okay? So please just call me when you get this. ‐ Miss Niven? That about does it. So I'll be heading back to the station now. Really appreciate your, Miss Niven? Miss Niven? ‐ I am really gonna be late, I'm so sorry, but are we done? Can we be finished here? I just feel like I've been very, very cooperative. ‐ Yes ma'am. I appreciate your help. ‐ Of course, yeah, no problem. You know what, you could actually just head on out the back. ‐ Have a lovely day. ‐ You too. Lindsay! ‐ Christa! I'm so glad you called. ‐ Uh, yeah, we need to talk. ‐ You sound upset. Are you mad at me, did I do something wrong? ‐ We can talk about it when we get there. What are you talking about, get where? ‐ I'm coming to your house. ‐ No. ‐ Why, what's the problem? ‐ No, sorry, I just meant that I'm actually not home right now. You know, I was gonna call you a second ago. That's weird, right? ‐ Ah yeah that is weird. So where are you, I'll come to you. ‐ Let's meet at Frock's in 15 minutes. I could just really use your professional advice. I'll pay you for your time of course. As you know I'm hosting the fashion show tonight. ‐ I am well aware. ‐ Right, of course. I'm giving a speech and I could really use a little help on looking beautiful and having the most confidence and who better to do that for me than you, right? ‐ 15 minutes, I will see you at Frocks and Walks. ‐ Where's my phone? ‐ Get inside, now. ‐ Damn. ‐ It's Jake. ‐ Jake? ‐ He knows that I'm here with you. ‐ You came by the shop to get a new dress. Put it on speakerphone now. ‐ Hi, honey. ‐ Christa, where are you? ‐ I'm just at the shop. I'm just picking up another dress. I'll see you there. ‐ What happened with Kat, did you confront her? ‐ No, no, I was just upset, so. I don't want you to be late, okay? ‐ Are you okay? You want me to come get you? ‐ No! No, no it's fine, I'll just see you soon, okay? ‐ Okay, jeez, you scared the hell out of me. ‐ I'm sorry. ‐ Hurry up and leave soon, okay? Remember, it's just a dress. You're gonna look perfect in whatever you wear. ‐ Jake? Yeah? ‐ I love you so much. ‐ I love you too, Christa Bright. Very much. I'll see you soon, okay? ‐ Give me the phone. Give me the phone! Now! Go. ‐ I'm your friend, you don't have to do this. ‐ Lindsay is your friend. I'm just your client, remember? ‐ Where is she? I asked you a question, where is she? ‐ Wow, you really are besties. Oh relax, she's in the car. She'll join us later, but right now, I mean let's not waste any time. You're on the clock, Christa. ‐ What are you talking about? Look at me. The dress, the hair. Gosh, you should be so proud of yourself. You really are good at your job. It's such a shame. ‐ What are you gonna do? ‐ Me? Oh no, no, don't worry, I'm not gonna do anything. You should be worried about the big bad burglars who are gonna break in here and find you and Lindsay just working late. And you're gonna be terrified and you're gonna run for the door. But you're not gonna be fast enough, and bam! Poor, poor Lindsay's gonna get hit in the back of the head, ouch. ‐ Even if you kill me, he's not gonna love you. ‐ He already loves me. ‐ He doesn't. ‐ He does! ‐ Stop! ‐ Please. Please don't. We're friends, remember? ‐ I have to. ‐ You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this, I'm your friend, please, this is not about me. This is about your past. Please, I'm begging you, stop. Don't kill me, please. ‐ I need you out of the picture. ‐ No, please don't. Please, don't shoot, please, please, I'm asking you please. ‐ I'm sorry. ‐ Where's Christa? ‐ She'll be here. ‐ Well, everyone is waiting. The girls are ready. ‐ Is everything okay? ‐ I don't know, dad. I hope so. ‐ Well, frankly, I'm not surprised. ‐ I love you mom, but if you say one more thing about the woman I'm gonna marry, I will never speak to you again. ‐ You've got to be kidding. ‐ Try me. ‐ Well, we can't wait much longer. ‐ Oh my god. Lindsay, oh my god, oh my god. Lindsay, oh my god. Lindsay. Oh my god. Hello? Oh my god! ‐ Oh. Thank you so much. Thank you ladies, that was beautiful, beautiful. The whole evening has just been marvelous and I wanna thank you all for coming. However, I would be remiss if I didn't introduce to you someone without whom this event would not have been possible. She donated this wonderful unique venue for our evening. But she's also a friend, and a friend whom we consider a member of the family. So, without further ado, ‐ I need to call her, see what's going on. ‐ Allow me to introduce you to Miss Kitty Niven. ‐ You look beautiful. ‐ Thank you, thank you. ‐ Oh my gosh, ah, that was so good, right? ‐ Kat. ‐ First of all, I have to give a big thank you to Mary and Joe. You guys have really made me feel like a member of the Walsh family. And I am just so grateful to partner my organization with such a respected fashion forward and altruistic enterprise. ‐ Call me back, I'm starting to worry. ‐ As the founder of Happy Hearts America Foundation, Philanthropy truly is my heart and soul. But, there's someone very special who has inspired me from the very beginning to help others and I am thrilled that we have recently had the opportunity to reconnect. ‐ The dress. ‐ There he is. That's the thing about life. Committed partnerships are very essential. They really are everything. Isn't that right, Jake? Jake, you remember, right? What it was like when you loved me? ‐ What are you talking about, just stop! Please, just stop it! This is enough! ‐ I will never stop. You are my destiny, Jake Walsh, and we are gonna be happy and we're gonna be together and everything is gonna be exactly how it was supposed to be, we can work it out, babe. And that's because you don't see that right now, because‐‐ ‐ Where is my fiancée, Kitty? Where's Christa? ‐ What is going on? ‐ I don't know but I don't think it's good. ‐ I do not want to talk about her. ‐ Mary, could you do something about this? ‐ Okay. ‐ I don't understand what you're talking about. I have no idea. ‐ Kitty, darling, thank you, thank you so so much. And really, thank you all for coming. And I think it is the perfect time for us all to grab a couple glasses of champagne, shall we? ‐ Where is Christa? ‐ Look at me, look at me, I wore this dress for you tonight. I just wanted you to be proud of me. ‐ Shut the hell up, Kat. What did you do? Is she here? ‐ I love you. ‐ Did you put her somewhere? Please, tell me. ‐ Jake, I have always loved you. I did all of this, all of this for you. Do you not understand that? I started this foundation because, because I thought, Jake. Jake, please! Jake. ‐ Christa! ‐ Talk to me, okay? ‐ This isn't high school. ‐ Jake. ‐ Christa! ‐ Stop. ‐ Just stop it. I don't wanna be with you. I don't wanna talk to you, okay, I don't want you near me or my family. Now where is she? Where's Christa? ‐ Why don't you want me? I don't understand it, Jake, it doesn't make any sense to me, why don't you want me? ‐ Kat! Did you hurt Christa? ‐ Stop saying her name! Look at me! Look, look at me, I'm different. I'm different than I was in high school, okay, I'm better. I'm better and we're gonna be happy and your mother loves me and don't you see that? ‐ I am tired of listening to your sick and delusional voice. I never should have let you into my life. Now where is my fiancée, you crazy psycho? Whatever you're doing right now needs to stop. Please, stop! Okay just stop, please just stop, stop, please! Where's Christa? So weird. ‐ You're just like them. You're just like them! ‐ Kitty! Kitty, please. Where's Christa? Where is she? Whoah. Kitty, just take a second, okay? ‐ Take it back. ‐ Kat. ‐ Tell me you love me. Say it! ‐ I can't. I don't. Goodbye, Kitty. ‐ Get away from my man! I trusted you. You almost ruined my family! ‐ That's enough. Sure, fine, step back. Step back. Listen to me, listen to me. Are you okay, are you okay? What's wrong? ‐ I was shot. She shot me. ‐ Where, are you okay, what's wrong? Call 911. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. ‐ It's okay, it's okay. I love you, I love you so much Jake Walsh. ‐ I love you too. I will never let go of you again. Oh my god. You did it. ‐ We did it. ‐ You think about Lindsay? ‐ It's just not the same without her. ‐ She's with us right now. ‐ You're amazing, you know that? ‐ Actually, yeah, I kinda do, I do. ‐ Attention everybody. It will come as no surprise that I have something to say. As most of you know, I am always right. But when it came to my daughter in law, I couldn't have been more wrong. Christa, will you come? This is a very, very special young woman. And it took me almost losing my son for me to realize that. I love you. ‐ I love you, Ma. ‐ But, but, but, we are not here for that, no. We are here to celebrate this special young woman and the opening of her new store. Glam Up Girl! Honey, will you do the honors? ‐ Yes. We wanted to do something special for our new daughter. And since we couldn't bring you all to the store just yet, we brought the store to you. So take a look. ‐ Oh my god. ‐ Congratulations. We're so happy for you. Oh my gosh. ‐ Cheers huh? ‐ Cheers, everybody. ‐ Cheers, cheers, yay. ‐ Cheers. ‐ Congratulations darling, we couldn't be more excited. Oh, you're so welcome. Cheers. Cheers, everyone. Thanks so much. ‐ I am so proud of you. ‐ I love you. ‐ I love you too. So does this mean
