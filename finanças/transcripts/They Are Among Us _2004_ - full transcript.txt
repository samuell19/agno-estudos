[thunder rumbles] [thunder rumbles] Who I am is unimportant... but what I'm about to say is. I know this is gonna sound unbelievable. They are among us. So I am standing there with this stick in my hand, hitting this piece of garden hose like a madman, with all these little kids just looking at me. What did you do when you realized what it was? Well, I maintained that it was a poisonous garden hose and that it had to be killed, no matter what the danger was to myself. The kids must have thought you were the bravest guy. A regular superhero. - [laughs] - Hmm. - You're not feeling well, honey? - I'm just not hungry. Is it graduation? You having second thoughts about Berkeley? I'm worried about Langford. He disappeared a few days ago and nobody's heard from him. Well, maybe he's just checking out colleges. Langford is a responsible young man. He'll turn up. Devon have any plans for your birthday? She has had a party for you every year since the two of you were seven, and this one's an important one. Eighteen? Eighteen? -My baby's almost a full-grown-- -Mom. Nothing's gonna change. Well, we've been thinking a lot about this day. So is Uncle Bob. He says he's got a present for you. I hear about this guy everywhere lately. He has revitalized the Civic Society. He's done wonders for our whole town. Which reminds me, we have another meeting Wednesday. Why does he want to give me a present? He wants you to do well. He probably wants you to be the youngest member of the Point Ridge Civic Society. Right. - Right. - [sighs] [woman whispering] Hugh, listen to me. [man whispering] He's going to find out. You have no idea how much they're watching us. - How do you know they're watching us? - I just know, I know. Hugh, please. They're gonna find out. We can't. We can't take it. How much longer do we have to keep it a secret? - We have to do this now, okay? - What are you doing? Oh, nothing, nothing. We're just hanging out. What have you got there? Something for your birthday. Come on, bed. Go. We would like it to be a surprise. Please, go. Hey, until your birthday, you are still a minor, and I can still order you around. Now go to bed. [man's voice echoing] Things are beginning to slip through our fingers. We must watch Colette and Hugh. I've told you that. Especially Colette's family. We understand, don't we? Good. You know what you must do. Does anyone know where Fitz is? It's all right. You can tell me. [boy] Fitz? Fitz. Are you down here, Fitz? [bell clanging] [wheels clacking] [snarling] [distant train horn] [growling] [snarling] Aah! Ugh! - [snarling] - Aah! Fitz! You've made a mistake. [snarling] You have made a mistake. This must never happen again, son. [growling] [echoing] June? June? I must talk with you. Yes, Bob? We have a problem here. I thought it was understood that Fitz's kind is a dilemma for us. It needs a correction immediately. Fitz? [June] Colette was told that-- Fitz was her responsibility tonight? Don't touch that! [growling] As you know, there are others like him. This behavior cannot be tolerated. Rest assured, it won't happen again. And did you receive the fruit basket I sent to your office? Yes. And it was lovely, Bob. Thank you. I'm a schizophrenic. I don't care. [ripping, tearing] [man screams] Maybe it's the same surprise I got when I turned 18. Which was? My dad showed me the door. - Harlan, you're not helping. - They're hippies. They get together with other hippies and relive their past. I saw the movie Woodstock. They got naked, covered themselves in mud and danced around all night. I'm sure I recognized your parents, Daniel. I think my dad was in junior high. My mom was, uh, what, five, maybe. Okay, guys, I thought we were talking about Langford. His parents haven't heard anything yet. - What the hell is in that box? - Hippies. I asked them about it once when I was, like, eight. They looked at me like I was crazy. That is weird. I think all parents are from another planet. They don't live in the same world we do. You know, I've seen them with it a lot more over the past few months. I've looked for it. We'll find that box. [Colette] The lights went out, Hugh. What do you want me to do? I can't see. [laughing] Don't stay up too late. - I won't. - Night, Danny. [Colette] Okay. [door closes] [car engine starts] [car accelerates] - They gone? - Yeah. Can't leave a mess. [thunder rumbles] [thunder rumbles] It was a dark and stormy night. [thunder rumbles] I found it. - You found it? - Yeah. Look. That's it. [brakes squeak] They're back. [Devon] Maybe it's like a Chinese box. You push here, you pull there? Maybe it's like a hood latch. I'll get you another one. - Give me the damn thing. - Wait. Just give me a sec. - How did you do that? - I don't know. What is this stuff? This paper is weird. - It feels wet, but it isn't. - Here, let me see. Just weird symbols. Dev, let me have a look. Hey, baby pictures. You were one cute kid. This looks like some sort of compass. [Harlan] Amusement park shit. No, it's gotta mean something. [Devon] There's this guy who always comes into the club. He's this hotshot at the University. He's supposed to be a genius in linguistics. Maybe we should show him this. Oh! It just got warm. I've never seen anything like this. And this paper, it feels like eelgrass, but it's so refined. This is definitely a language, with the grouping and repetition of these symbols. It's not European or Asian. It could be an early form of cuneiform. Except for these curves. Where did you get this? Uh, kind of a garage sale. Can you bring this to my office tomorrow? It's the Broder Building, fourth floor. I'll get you a copy. Later. Thanks, man. Thanks. [beeping] [static] I don't know what I'm looking for, but I know it's out there. That why you never finished high school? That, and I just didn't go to class enough. Right. What if the box is just a family heirloom? Something passed down or just a sentimental thing. You know, I keep catching people staring at me and smiling. Or maybe your folks don't want you to know that great-great grandpa was beheaded by the sultan for spying on the harem. Parents don't know what's cool. Bro, could you be serious for one minute? If I had something to be serious about, I'll tell you this. I wouldn't get all freaked out if my parents kept secrets from me. Whatever this is about, it's not going to change your life, unless you let it. Yeah, easy-- I gotta get some fresh air. You know, he really cares about you like a brother. Yeah, sometimes even brothers get on each other's nerves. [banging] [whispering] [echoed speech] Or maybe it's just a secret language your parents created when they were young so they could pass love letters. Come on, I've seen the way your dad looks at your mother. I bet they have a great sex life. - Oh... - What? All we got to do-- Just follow them. I got to get home. Later. What am I gonna do with you? I don't know. [Woman] You've reached the office of Dr. Leonard Norbert. - Kindly leave your message. - [beep] Hi. I'm calling to make an appointment with Dr. Norbert. I'd like to get some work done as soon as possible. This is Sandi Smith-- that's Sandi with an "I"-- and, um, I guess I'll just come by tomorrow morning. Okay. Thanks a bunch. They're watching us. There are things he needs to know. Either way, you're gonna have to talk to him, Hugh. Now. You want me to tell him everything? - [woman] Hi, Colette! - Hi, Nancy. How's Jack? You don't have to tell him everything, just what he needs to know now. He'll figure out the rest on his own. It's just the way things are. Yeah. I know. Hello. - So. - So my boyfriend keeps going on and on about models with big lips, so I thought that... - You want to give him what he wants. - Yeah. You understand there is always some pain associated with altering one's physical appearance. I've heard that. You must love him very much. I want to look pretty for him all the time. Well, what we can do is we can insert some... nylon fibers in your lips. But what about injections? I mean, don't you use collagen? Collagen? No, never. We-- No, I don't use collagen around here. Why not? I'm not satisfied with the results or that it's safe, and there is a... a problem with storage. Oh. Well, nylon fibers. That sounds really expensive. This is really important to me, and I would do almost anything to look prettier. Well, I'm sure that we could work something out. So what's the story about you and Devon? She's Harlan's girl. Oh. Really? Yeah. I think you two are absolutely right for each other. You know, it takes two. Think about what you want, then take the chance. Tell her how you feel. You know, Dan, um, there are a lot of things happening very fast. You're gonna be going through a lot of changes, decisions. You're gonna be in a lot of new situations and assuming a lot of responsibilities that have serious consequences. It's a heavy load. I want you to know that I'm here for you. Always. I'll answer any questions that you might have about... anything. Do you have any questions? Um... Yeah. Look, Dad. I've been noticing through the years that... there's... I just want, you know, you and mom to, uh-- Go ahead, go ahead. To not embarrass me at the graduation when, you know, you run on the field, you're taking the pictures-- [chuckles] All right. Ooh. I gotta go. I'll see you. Damn. What would his password be? His password would be-- Password. [sighs] How about "money"? Money sounds good. "I create beauty." Let's try "God." Oh! Unbelievable. You bet your ass we can work something out, Dr. Norbert. This is it. [snarling] Oh, my God. [thunder rumbles] [Hugh] I don't think it's our night. No, Hugh! We have to be sure! - Oh, God. - What? Oh, my God. It was last night. We missed it. [gasps] Hold on. Hold on. I got it. I got it. Okay, move your hand. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I got it. I got it, honey. They're gonna be watching us closer than ever now. Oh, God. Don't you worry. I'm gonna protect my family. Brooks, Brooks, Brooks... [click] [thump] Uncle Bob? What the... Dad. [woman] Do you have any idea what you just risked? Do you have any idea? Did you even think? I don't care how you feel about it. I don't care what your concerns are. June Jarrod. Sometimes life just isn't fair! Slap her back, Mom. When you say you're gonna do something, you do it, okay? You have a responsibility. Gotta run. Ta-ta. Bye-bye now. [door closes] Bitch. [laughter] So, Daniel tells us you're going to Stanford. Yeah. You two won't be far apart. Yeah. That's gonna be really cool. So what have you got planned for my boy's birthday? Well, we'll probably do what we usually do-- stay up and celebrate at midnight? You know, technically, since you were born at 4:02 a.m., that's the time to celebrate. [Hugh] That's a night we won't forget. It was flooding. We couldn't get to the hospital. [Hugh] Nothing changes much. The power went out then, too. You know, staying up late is kind of a teenage thing, and I just think I'm past all that. Oh, guess who I saw in town today: June Jarrod. Oh, yeah? Oh, she's back in town? Yeah. I forgot to tell you. She's gonna be at the Civic dinner, and she's gonna be telling us all about the new business contacts abroad. Ah! It's gonna be fun to catch up with her. She slapped her, then she kissed her? Then she denied ever seeing her. That's creepy. Creepy, creepy. [phone ringing] - Yeah? - Dan, listen. I don't have much time. Langford! Where are you, man? Are you all right? Listen! It's not safe to talk. None of us are safe anymore. Yeah, well, what the hell is going on? - We thought you were dead-- - Shut up and listen to me! This is some serious shit! I found something. Something you should know about. It's unlike anything I've ever seen or read about. What are you talking about? Where are you? Did you called your parents, man? No, no, no! And don't you call them either. Shit. I can't stay here, man. Listen, when I can, I will find you. I just want you to know I'm still kicking. At first I thought I was crazy, but... it's true. They are among us. [rustling] Langford! Disconnected. And they're having one of those dinners tonight. Gotta go, Chuck. See ya, Old Chuck. Mr. Miyagawa, what are you doing here? It's Tashi. You know that piece of paper you showed me with the writing? Seems like there's a few other examples around. Can you tell me where you really found it? I don't really buy this whole garage sale story. I said it was kind of a garage sale. Look, we went to a local library sale, and we found it in one of the books. I don't even know what book it was in. We kind of lost interest in it anyway. [bell rings] I guess I'll see you later. ♪ [classical] [chattering] [indistinct] I don't wanna be here. I hate these things. It's important that you act like you're having a good time. The camera's in place. You got a picture? Just about. [Harlan] Huh. Intriguing. A bunch of finely dressed, boring people standing around telling boring stories. Oh, and eating expensive food. Damn. We've gotta get in there. ♪ [classical] You do look great, Lucinda. I've rarely had to go back to Dr. Norbert. He really knows how to fix my skin. It stays fixed. The man's a genius. We're so lucky to have him. Excuse me, everyone. If I may have a moment before the evening slips away. I would like to thank our host... Robert Porter. Robert, thank you for having us in your beautiful home. Now, I heard a story the other day that-- that I would now like to relate to you, and it has to do with how Robert got his nickname... "Uncle Bob." [Dr. Norbert] A circus came into town-- When was it, '63? He was sifting in the front row by himself, and ran out into the center ring and actually snatched the nose off a clown, right? [Harlan] What's going on? [Dr. Norbert] I would also like to take a moment to say how grateful I am that you have accepted me into your community here. [whispering] They want me? [Dr. Norbert] You've opened your arms... It'll be okay. [Dr. Norbert] ...a gracious community, like none other. You've accepted me, and I have to admit the first day that I rolled into town... Why isn't my mom going with him? [Harlan] We've got to get in there. [Dr. Norbert] And I just want to say how honored I am to be here and to serve you and your needs. [Uncle Bob] Your boy's big day is upon us. I bet he's excited. Yeah, he sure is. He can't wait. I'm sure he can't. Even though it was a hell of a long time ago, I still remember my younger days. Very exciting times. Very exciting. [sizzles] Harlan. Colette tells me that you don't remember your parents. [Harlan] There they are. That's your dad. [Bob] You all might not know this, but Hugh's parents died when he was very young. On a camping trip, wasn't it? In the desert. It was only by luck that we found young Hugh before he, too, died. Hugh had an illness when he was a child that scared many of us. Rheumatic fever, wasn't it? No. Because of that, we never really welcomed him. That was a mistake. Tonight we're going to change that. We're going to show him our souls tonight. After all, he's Colette's husband. [growling, snarling] - [snarling] - What the hell is that thing? Whatever it is, it ain't comfortable. This is a very delicate time. We are a very disciplined group, but sometimes someone violates that discipline, and that threatens us all. We cannot allow one to endanger the many. We must punish those who do. [snarling] Oh, my God. [groans] - What the hell is going on? - I don't know. Where's my dad? [snarling] We don't take the destruction of our own lightly. It's a shame, but sometimes the implantation doesn't work. This still makes him part of us. - My God! - [groans] Yes. Yes! - Have you seen Fitz? - No. - I haven't seen him anywhere. - It's all right. [Hugh] It was the most gruesome, disgusting thing I've ever seen. All those nightmares I've had my whole damn life. It wasn't coyotes. It was them. They're the ones that tore my parents apart. Take these. Right now. Come on. Now Daniel is leaving. There is no way in hell I want him to witness any of this! I know. Oh, no. I'm sorry, Colette, but I didn't think it was gonna be like this. He is our son. Huh? Come on, Dev, where are you? Sometimes they keep her late. Hi, boys. You wanna come to a party? No. We're waiting on somebody. Oh. But I insist. Really. - I saw you boys leaving that little soiree tonight. - What's it to you? When you have the gun, you can ask the questions. You, put out your arm. Come on, push up your sleeve. Ah! Sorry about the theatrics. It's the only way to tell. If you mean tell who's psycho, I think we know. Saw your name in that doctor's files, and I had to be sure. What doctor? Be sure of what? We bleed, they don't. - Who are "they"? - They don't have bones. Again, who are "they"? They have exoskeletons covered by skin. Exoskeleton. Like a crab. You got something to say, lady? Say it straight up. My name's Finley and "they" are creatures. You should only try that when you have a chance in hell of succeeding. - Now sit down. - Harlan. [clicks] Did you guys hear about that body that was found up here three weeks ago? Your work? The official cause of death was listed as an animal attack, but that's a cover. What killed him was advanced, severe collagen disease. That's a breakdown of the body's connective tissues. I'm sure it'll be the same for the body that was found up here yesterday. Come on. I wanna show you something. You could bash out my brains with that thing. Then you'd only be doing me a favor. Come on. Relax. Okay? My father was a young fighter pilot in the last days of Project Bluebook, the Air Force report on UFOs. He never saw a UFO, but he filed the first official report on crop circles. The brass said, "Don't mention crop circles" because they'll put "unbalanced" on his record. -He had a family to support, so he kept quiet. -What's that have to do with us? When he couldn't keep quiet anymore, he turned in his wings and he started investigating the crop circles on his own. There was a connection between certain designs and an increase of collagen disease in those areas-- Advanced, severe collagen disease. And that's when he found the colony. - Colony. What colony? - Where's your dad now? He wasn't the type to be taken alive. What did you see in that house tonight? Uh, not sure. All right, it looked like someone was, uh... being sacrificed by these people. They're not people, okay? They're parasites. They may look human, but they're not. But they incubate in the ground, and when they're big enough to crawl, they crawl out of this hole and they find a human host. By the time that they reach this host, they are starving for collagen-- human collagen. Does your dad meet with these people often? - Does he bleed? - Yes. He cut himself the other day. He bleeds, red. What about your mom? Does she think bandages are a fashion trend? How-- You sent that video. I wanna show you something. Come. Can you hear 'em? Something's gonna happen in this town, soon. I don't know what it is, but it's gonna be big. Devastating, unless we find the nest. [howling] [owl hooting] I'll be right back with the box. Just wait here. [clicks] Hey! Mom, are you all right? I think it's time that you know the truth. Come on. [woman] How do you suppose she got that? Look at her. She's a zombie. Is that normal? Mom? Look at her eyes. My parents aren't monsters. You touch either one of them-- I don't want to hurt them, but I have come too far to be stopped. I might be the only one that can help your parents. Is this the box? Mom? [whining] Aah! Aah! Aah! Dr. Norbert's good, but he's not that good. [engine starts] [knocking] Come. I'm sorry to bother you, sir. That's all right. I was just absorbing. Miss Jarrod is here with poor Lucinda. Apparently, the woman's camper was booby-trapped. That'll be all. [door closes] [groaning] No. [groaning] Oh! Oh. [knocking] Dev, it's open. [knocking] Dev, it's open. Look, I need your help. No gun in my face this time? No knife? Your interpersonal skills are really improving. - I'll fill you in on the way. - On the way? You seriously think I'm going anywhere with you? Not that I mind, but you might want to put on some clothes. [gasps] Oh, geez. You scared us, son. - I scared you? - Yeah. What are you doing up so late? Your dad and I have been talking about this for days, and... we're-- we're... we're so happy because we finally came up with a present for you. [Hugh] It's something quite suitable for a kid of your caliber. Three months in Australia. Yeah, the Southern Cross from the middle of the Outback. Hundreds of miles from city lights. You'll be able to see stars you've never seen before. - Australia? - Yeah. It's amazing. Uh, when? Well, we're gonna drive you to the airport in just a few hours. - A few hours. - Yeah. I can't leave now. No, your passport's in order. The shots from your Japan trip, they're still good. - There's absolutely no reason-- - But my-- My friends. No. The ticket is confirmed. You have to go. We packed your bags, Dan. It was supposed to be a surprise. We want you to have a terrific birthday. [phone ringing] Yeah. Langford! Hey, ho-- Hold on. I can't go now. Where the hell are you? I'm just waiting for a friend. Dan, I just stopped by the locker room. Are you at the school? You know how much I loved playing ball there? I'm gonna miss that place so much. The times I had in that room, I mean, even when we lost, they were the best. Just stay where you are. I'll be right there. It's all over, Dan. It's-- It's all over now. Langford! Just stay where you are. I'm coming to get you. [brakes squeak] No, no, Dan, seriously, don't bother. There's no need for that. We'll be long gone by then, and I'll just hook up with you later. [June] Ta-ta. June. Gotta run. June Jarrod. I'll be there in ten minutes! No, Dan, seriously. Don't bother. [beep] Finley? [Harlan] Talk to me. It's dark. I can't make anything out. Shit. My flashlight just went dead. [faint growling] - Oh, my-- - Finley? Finley? [deep voice] Finley? Finley? - Finley? Finley? - What is this? [deep voice] Finley, what's going on? [Harlan] Finley, what's going on? Finley? - Can you hear me? - Yeah, I can hear you. [dripping] Oh, my gosh. [Harlan] Finley, everything okay? Finley? I'm just-- just fine. So tell me about your dad. You said he was a pilot. What'd he fly? Fighters. F-4's, F-16's. So you lived on base? Finley? Finley, what's going on? We lived off base, except in Japan. Oh, really? I always wanted to go to Japan. Yeah, yeah. I always thought maybe when I was a little older, I would go and hang out there and-- Get me up! - What was that? - Get me up! I'm getting you up. [snarling] [Devon] Why wouldn't she tell you why she freaked? What was in that hole? [Harlan] She was shaking so hard, I could barely hold her. You held her? You know, when Lang called, he sounded all messed up, and then he sounded great. When he was with June Jarrod. She keeps turning up. I know all about her. Oh, really? I think I can get some information from her. A couple of years ago, she got her hooks into my brother's best friend, and he hasn't been the same since. Who knows what she's done to Langford? And I do not want her doing that to you. Relax, Dev. She's not gonna do anything to me. [Devon] No, you cannot go near her. I'm serious. Promise me you won't go near that Jarrod bitch. God help me, but l love tough women. Sir. You must not take that which is not yours. [liquid pouring] Thanks. I'd love a glass. Well. And all this time, I thought you didn't like me. I like to take my time. Never rush anything. This is a nice place you have here. Mmm! No, I can't. I love the sensation of a real man's hands on my body. No. I have a girlfriend. No one needs to know. You know, we could burn in eternity for this. I can feel the flames of hell licking at my feet already. Give me a minute. I wanna get comfortable. I'm gonna eat you up. And Devon's gonna kill me. [ringing] - Old Chuck here. - Hi, Old Chuck. Is Harlan there? Already left. Helped me pull a tranny and then got all gussied up and he was out of here. Put on a whole mess of that froufrou cologne he always wears whenever you two go out special. I think you're gonna have a real good time tonight. Oh, really? Thanks. I can't believe he went to see her. He promised me. [ringing] Get your tongue out of his ear and answer the damn phone. [phone ringing] Mmm. Opium incense. [sniffs] She's got style. Get out. Now. You weren't supposed to see that, you bad boy. I don't usually leave things like that hanging around, but it's been so hectic lately. Let's just forget about what we saw and get back to what we were doing. You... You killed him! What the hell are you? All your fantasies come true. You're not leaving, Harlan. Sometimes life isn't fair. I'm a woman. Just a little different than the other women you know. More aggressive, more in control. Get away from me, you alien whore. I think you'll like the difference. [echoing] It's okay, Harlan. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. That's better, isn't it? Better. Soon you'll understand. Understand. And just keep your mouth shut and look pretty. Please. The next time you come, come in the service entrance like we agreed, all right? How many times you have to tell them to use the service entrance? That's it. I'm not doing it anymore. But what will your most loyal patients do without you? They must hold you in high esteem, they haven't eaten you yet. What the hell are you doing here? I want to know when this event is happening and where. Chief Rudacker happens to be a very close personal friend. I could have a squad car here in about two minutes. And I could have the state police here in five. I can show them your files and the 43 extremely deformed individuals in those files. Go ahead. Make the call. Oh, but the people here, the humans, they'll find out that you were run out of Beverly Hills for experimenting on the homeless and destitute. Those people were paid for their troubles. How do you think new procedures are developed for decent people, huh? [scoffs] Decent? Like the people you work for now, Doctor? I don't care what happens to you. I just want to know when and where. Oh, sure, I can help, but I-- Bitch! You tell me when the event is happening or where the nest is. - Your choice. - You don't understand. I can't tell you. You haven't seen what they do to humans! As long as you're the human, I don't care. [Daniel] Dev, he can take care of himself. The thing about Harlan is, he's wild, crazy, impulsive, the most gentle person I know. But I'm changing, and he isn't. Dev. You've gotta know how I feel about you. [creaking] Did you hear that? Oh, it happens all the time. You know, I was born in this room, and it has always creaked. I don't even notice it anymore. Someone's here to see you, Uncle Bob. Come on in. I'm sure you are aware I'm head of the Judiciary Committee. I've been responsible for the 10 western states for the last 20 years, and I'll be damned if I let anyone screw that up. We are not happy with the things we've heard and the things we've learned. If they're true, it could lead to dire consequences. However, perhaps you have explanations. Ex-Explanations for what? You've missed an awful lot of Civic dinners. Well, we've been very busy with Daniel and everything. He has to be told about me, about us, about the work that we do. The colony isn't supposed to interfere with work and... I've-- I've been very tired. I think that I'm... I'm getting ill. Hugh, did you buy a coach ticket to Sydney, Australia, three days ago? Yes. I have a sick relative there. Who? My cousin Dorothy. True. Dorothy Bingham, Sydney, Australia. Second cousin. Yeah. Why are you watching us? Our entire existence depends upon maintaining order. We watch everyone, but tonight is most important to all of us. Colette, you must know how we feel about you. A certain researcher from the State University came by the library, looking for information about our design, our meaning. [girl] He got the design from a girl that goes to my brother's high school. Devon. - Little Miss Popular. - May I just say-- [girl] You were given a responsibility, Colette. An honor. And now you may ruin everything out of some foolish, selfish desire. [strange voice] We cannot allow you simply because of your regal heritage. [normal voice] Bob, will decide what to do with you at this point. Just make sure you have Daniel there tonight. [girl] Does he know what he's about to witness? Good. Now let's get out of here before Hugh's lips turn blue. Finley! Finley! Mom, Dad, what the hell are you doing? There's a credit card in here with a $10,000 limit. Take it. Every time you stop, take out as much cash as you can and then you move on. Don't stay in one place. And don't travel in a straight line, or they will find you. What are you talking about? You're leaving, and you're not coming back here. I'm not leaving! Danny! We know what they want. Now, your mother and I will slow them down as much as possible and give you some time to get as far away from here as you can. We don't want you to be any part of the-- What, the celebration? Yes. Are those tears real, or is it something you learned? You're my son. My only child. We are sending you away for your own safety. I may never see you again. I'm not leaving until you tell me the truth! Who are you? Come here. You have to go now. Dad, I can't run away. I'm sure as hell not going to leave Devon. They don't care about her, Danny. Please, just get the hell out of here. Danny, I love you. Now go on! [engine starts] I'll find you. Colette? [Uncle Bob's voice] It's time to prepare for the celebration. - [knocking] - Who is it? It's Devon. [gasps] God! No. He just thinks he is. Just a doctor. Not even board certified at that. Please, make her let me go. Shut up. I just give people what they want. They're not people, you son of a bitch. Finley, is this really gonna help? No, but it's making me feel a lot better. We had a nice little chat. He told me everything. Well, almost everything. Oh, please! I don't know anything else. They don't tell me anything. They just pay me to put 'em back together. That's it! I'm done! Nothing else! - I swear! - Tell me about tonight. Please. Where is the event gonna happen? - Where? - Okay! Uncle Bob's house. There, okay? Fine. Uncle Bob's house. - Why? - Oh, please, no. Finley, stop! I thought you wanted your friends back... alive and human. [engine starts] Ow! Gol-durn piece of buzzard bait! Held together with cat fur and raccoon snot. Ow! Ooh! Who is that? Oh, is that you, Danny? Didn't recognize you from that angle. You're usually standing up when I see you. I'm just looking for my bike. Oh, Harlan took out the electric starter and-- It looks like the time has come, my boy. No, not you too, Chuck. Closing for safety reasons, folks! Come back later! [woman] We're here to see Daniel! You and me need to talk, and we don't have much time. - [banging] - [woman] We're here to see Daniel! I know what they are, Danny. I've been watching them things ever since I was your age, and it all leads back to one in particular-- the thing that calls hisself Uncle Bob. He ain't anything like us humans. I first run into him outside of Fort Bragg, right after I got back from Korea. He stills looks exactly the same now as he did back then. Not a day older. I asked myself how can that be. There's no rational answer. [woman] Is Daniel around? But I know how to survive. I just keep my mouth shut. When I'm not playing the fool, I-I pretend everything's fine. But I don't think you can live that way. Go out the back door. Go on. Thanks, Old Chuck. You can do it, Danny. [banging continues] You can come in now, folks. Danger's over. Is Daniel around? We have a birthday present for him. I was just doing a little asbestos work is all. As they say, it'll kill you, but I don't believe 'em. [groaning] You wouldn't have made him talk, would you? Let's find your friends. We'll discuss philosophy later. [whispers] Danny. Danny. Mom! What are you-- I can stop it. I have the power to stop it, but you have to do what I say. You promise me? I don't want you to do anything. Let's just go. Where's Dad? I have to stay here. I have to go inside. The others will be there. They don't know what I can do. I can end this. I'm gonna end this. You're not going anywhere but with me. You stay here. You've grown up beautifully. I don't know you. The last time I saw you, you were just off to first grade. You're early. I didn't expect you this soon. We won't get started for a little while yet. Come closer. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. You are. Yet you came anyway. That means you're courageous. That's good. You've come this far. We want you to come the rest of the way. Are you ready for tonight? What are you talking about? Hugh hasn't talked with you? You're important to us. Colette's ancestry is of the highest order. And Hugh? Hugh is a very special human. He has had to accept many things, but he did it because of his love for your mother and for you. What are you? We don't know where we came from. Our research suggests that we fell to Earth attached to a meteorite that landed near here. Oh, you're from outer space. You're crazy... or I am. Either way, I'm out of here. I gotta get in there. [Daniel] Harlan. No. And Langford. [exhales] I wish I had something clever to say, Leonard, but I've got more important things on my mind. Can bullets kills them? No. These are filled with naphthalene crystals. Should blow a hole right through them. I'm not the type to be taken alive. I'll meet you in the field, by the trees. I'll leave a red bandana. I don't know how this is gonna turn out. Just do your best. Knowing them... your daddy's dead. A million pieces. [blows] [chuckles] Collagen. No. No. No. Oh, please, no. No! No! No, please! Oh, what a mess. How careless of me. Get back here! Do you know who I am! You don't know what they're going to do to me! We have waited a long time for this night. A night many thought would never come. But we believed. And in a few short minutes, our faith will be rewarded. Friends, this is a grand day. A day that you will relate to your progeny for generations to come. Two hundred years from tonight, you will celebrate with your family at your side, in front of the fireplace, on a cold but celebratory night. A night that will forever change our species. We must transcend the stream of time and space. Bring in the vessel. That'll be all. [ticking] In one moment, a new dawn. Our wait through hundreds of years, plus 18, will end. Eighteen. My friends, the pupa, our lifeblood. The only remnant of life from our planet. The pupa will be red hot, but it will not burn you, my dear. It will fill you with a peaceful sensation, the likes of which you have never known. This sensation is rightfully yours. Colonies all over the Earth are watching. Tonight we will fully integrate with humans. We are not a weed species. In 15 seconds, Colette's son will become the first half-colonist, half-human. No. Tonight he will be made complete. He will receive the lifeblood from the pupa. That will make him royalty. That will make him our leader. No! [chiming] [growling, snarling] No! You! You... ungrateful... - Mom! - Colette, no! Aah! Hugh. - disrespectful... - No! meddling, stupid... human! Where is it? What did you do with it? We can't exist without it and neither can you! Mom. Mom. Mom. I'm sorry, Danny. I can't control what I am. Danny, run! Oh, God. [creatures growling] - Daniel! - Devon! [cocks shotgun] Go to hell. [howls] She said she'd meet us here. Was Harlan there? Yeah. Devon. - Hey, man, you even try-- - Hey, man. I'm just kiddin'. What? I thought you were one of them. Hell no. I got nothing up here they can use, baby. I hate to break up this little reunion, but we've got work to do. It's nice to see you're still one of us. You guys gotta get someplace safe. - And what about you two? - We have to find the nest, and we have to do it while they're still confused. - We gotta finish this. - [cocks shotgun] - We'll meet up later. - Come with us. I'll see you later. Dev... I promise. Now go. I know where the pupa is. Really? And I think I found the nest. Why do you think things didn't go smoothly tonight, June? You taught us nothing in this world is perfect, Bob. You're making excuses like a human. You need a correction. Please. Don't absorb me, Bob. [voice modulating] Please, don't absorb me, Bob. I enjoy being a human too much. Dr. Norbert, is that you? [sniffs] It's me, Ralph. Ralph? Please. Could you untie me? Dr. Norbert is in here. No. Oh, please, no. Ralph? Ralph. Ralph? Aah! It's all right. No! No! [growling, chomping] [thunder rumbling] This can't be it. Well, it looks like someone's home after all. [screams] [creature roars] No. I'll bury you in a minute. In pieces. [thunder rumbles] You sure made quite a mess at that birthday party upstairs. I never meant for you to be part of this hell. You've got to get out of this town, then start your life, Jennifer Finley. I'd prayed that you'd understand that when I didn't come back to get you. What'd you say? Where's that thing? Who are you? My name's Old Chuck, ma'am. I run a little service station up off of Route-- It's not safe for you to be here. You've gotta go. Don't you worry about me, little darling. I'll be all right. You go. I'll be along directly. I've got some cleaning up to do down here. Who are you? Aah! [screeching] [body falls] I'm gonna end this. [creaking] [thunder rumbling] [creaking continues] God. [distant growl] The nest is in my room. It was here all along. The nest was born the same day you were. Our new race begins and ends with you. This is our new home: Earth. Oh, my God. We will live like humans, and in time, there will be one race: ours. For 18 years, the guardian stood watch over you, making certain nothing alters your destiny. [growling] - Not even you. - No! Help! - Danny! - Dad! [roars] Get away from him, you son of a bitch! Dad! [roars] Dad, I can't move! - Get away. - Dad! - Get away! Fast! - No! Dad! Go! Now! Danny, run! - Aah! - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad. Oh, no, Dad. Oh, Dad. I love you, Devon. I know this is going to sound unbelievable... but none of it is made up. [thunder rumbles] [Devon's voice] We'll probably do what we usually do: stay up and celebrate at midnight. You know, technically, the time of his birth was 4:02 a.m. That's the time to celebrate. What? What's wrong? There's something moving under your skin. Oh, my God. I'm one of them. - No! No, you're not! - Stay away from me! - Daniel! - I don't want you here! - No, I'm staying! - You can't be around me! I'm not going anywhere! I love you, Devon. I'll never be one of them. Devon and I are on the road now. Always on the move. Old Chuck told Harlan to wait outside the cave. He said there'd be a woman there and to get her the hell out of town. And that's when Finley found what she'd been looking for, buried deep in the lining of the jacket Old Chuck had given her. "Charles D. Finley." Dad. Finley is more determined than ever to find every last one of the creatures. And Harlan, he found Finley. You doing anything special this summer? I don't know. Why? Did you ever consider saving the world? Our four lives crossed paths as we moved from town to town. Finley and Harlan search for more colonies... while the colonies search for me. It's all right, really. All teenagers have problems.
