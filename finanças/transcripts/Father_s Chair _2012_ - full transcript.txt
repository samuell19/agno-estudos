Pedro? Theo? Theo, how did you get in? Can you believe that Pedro left me waiting... at the exchange student meeting? - What do you mean? - He didn't show up. I called him up, he didn't answer the phone. - He didn't show up. - So? Branca, I called you up and you didn't answer the phone. I've been ringing the bell for half an hour, you didn't answer the door. And you left this door here open. Theo, there's no way. You can't just keep coming in like this, without calling first. Branca, I'm sorry. Is Pedro here? - And you can't have a key anymore. - Branca, if our only problem... is me having or not having the key to this place... - we were doing alright, huh? - Yeah, that's not the problem. I'm the problem. For me to continue living here, huh? That's the problem, right? I brought Zezé's money. I want you to pay him... only after he finishes waterproofing the pool. - Can you do that? - Why waterproof it? The tiles, they'll be delivered next week, they're already paid for. - Why tiles? - Why? I don't know, Branca. Maybe to cover the hole out there on the verandah. I don't know why you're making a pool... if we're going to sell the house, Theo. Because it'll bring the price up, right? Because we'll make money. But, maybe the guy who buys it doesn't want a pool... - Yeah, he might not like the house. - Might not know how to swim. Let's stop around here, please. I'm tired as hell. We don't even know if we're going to sell the house. What do you mean? You don't seem to understand. As soon as I find my own place, I'm leaving. Do you understand? - Where were you, son? - My computer broke. I took it to get fixed. We had an appointment today, did you forget? You had. Alone. I had an appointment. Alone. It was important for him to go today. Today was the day... They have this rule there, that says the kids... have to go at least one day. If they don't go one day... To be able to pick your city. You have to go just once. Just one time. To guarantee you get Christchurch, I had to pay. - Now, he'll have to go next time. - You paid? You'll have to go to the next meeting... Otherwise, there's no way we can guarantee you can pick your city. Dad, I'm not going! I don't want to! You don't... Why aren't you going, Pedro? Just for me... The way I see it, I'm giving him a good opportunity, right? Am I wrong? Isn't it something good? A trip? For you to speak English, go to the best country in the world. If I were a sheep. Theo, you can't force something like this... But, I gave him two options. On two different continents. I wish my father had given me something like this. It can't always be the way you want it. You thought it was a good idea. And you're going to decide for him? - And when is he going to decide? - When he decides, Theo. If he decides. You can't just send the boy off to Australia. New Zealand. That's not the issue. The issue is always something else, huh? Yes. It's always something else. What's that, Branca? What's what? - Theo... - What is this chair doing here? It's for his birthday, Theo. - Why are you doing this to me? - Nobody is doing anything. Why are you doing this, man? Why this? What is this, Branca? - Calm down, Theo. - What is it? What is this chair doing here? Why are you doing this, Branca? - Wait, Theo, take it easy. - Why are you doing this to me? - What is this chair doing here, Pedro? - My grandfather sent it. Your grandfather? But, what grandfather, Pedro? - Listen, Theo... - Who is your grandfather? - I'm going to put it in my room. - Wait, hold it. Who is your grandfather? - Dad... - What grandfather? - I'm going to put it in my room. - Hold it, Theo. Just a second, Branca. Let me ask him. - Right, but don't be like this. - Does he know his grandfather? Who is your grandfather? Do you know him? - Give me my chair. - Has your grandfather ever seen you? - Dad. - Does he know you? - Let go. - Hold it. Let me talk to you. - Let go of my chair. - Does your grandfather know you? Hold it! Does your grandfather know you? He doesn't know me! He doesn't know you! - He doesn't know you! - You don't even live here anymore! - Give me my chair! - He doesn't know me! - He doesn't know you! - Give me my chair! - Stop it, Theo! - I'll show you all! - Don't do that, Theo! - Dad! Do you want your key? Do you want your key? FATHER'S CHAIR DOCTOR BRANCA GADELHA Pedro? Are you going? Have they come to pick you up already? I'll be back on Sunday, mom. - Have dinner with me? - Yes. Kisses. Happy birthday! I got my things. I'm going. - I'll help you. - No problem. I'm sorry. - You didn't have to do that, Theo. - I know, I'm sorry. Really, you shouldn't have done it. Can you forgive me? Did you know about this chair? - Theo... - It isn't easy for me, Branca. I know. Go back home and I'm not living there anymore... it isn't easy. I'm sorry. Is Pedro up? Pedro went on a trip. - It's his birthday on Sunday. - He went someplace with Levy. Did you let him go? He didn't ask, Theo. But, the exchange program, I don't know... I thought it was something good. I thought that it was something he'd like, that was good for him... good for him to stay away a bit, on his own... while we worked things out. Things aren't going to work out, Theo. But, he doesn't have to stick around and watch. - I'm leaving that house. - I'm not talking about that anymore. - I don't... - I've already given your key back. - I never wanted to live in that house. - I won't go there anymore. You don't want me to go? I won't go. Branca, I made that house for you. It was always something you wanted, Theo. Let me talk. I made that house for you. - Right. - Branca. - Theo... - I made the house for you, for Pedro... I made the house for us. - Stop it. - What's happened to us? Tell me. - Theo, we've already talked about this. - What's happening, Branca? What do you want me to do? Tell me. - Theo... - What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Tell me? Tell me. Theo, let me go. Theo, please. Theo... Hold it, Theo. - Hi. - Hi, Theo. So, I'm going to have dinner with Pedro on Sunday, at home. - If you want to show up. - OK. I'll go. How's it going? Hi, Theo. Come in. You've already made dinner. No problem. Put it here. - It's just that Pedro likes... - Yeah, he loves it. Do you want to drink something? Water. Thanks. Sit down, Theo. I can't figure... this out... I don't now... - It's here. - No. There's just one cable. Looks good. Yeah, he likes these here... And the grant? - Only in September. - Yeah right, you said before. Have you decided where you're going? I think I prefer Spain. For your specialty, the United States would be better, huh? It's just that in Spain, besides medical school, there's Spain. Yeah. - Pedro's taking too long. - Did he say what time he'd be here? - He didn't say. - Didn't you tell him? - I just said dinner. - Let's call? I've already called twice. I'm going to call Levy. Hello, Levy? Hi, it's Branca. So, are you guys back already? What do you mean, "from where"? Didn't you guys travel, Levy? What do you mean? Isn't Pedro there with you? Hold it, Levy. You don't know? Where's Pedro? - Renata. - Hi, Theo. - How's everything? - Hi, Renata. So, Levy? What's going on? Pedro told Branca that he was going to spend the weekend with you. He didn't say anything to me. You haven't spoken to him? He didn't call? Nothing? - Since Saturday. - Didn't Pedro tell you, Levy... where he was going to spend the weekend? - No, he didn't tell me anything. - Tell the truth, son. - Levy, he said... - I am. He told me he was going to travel with you, Levy. No, he didn't come here. He didn't tell me anything. - No way, Levy. - Levy... We hardly talked this week. OK, no problem. Listen... Do you know if he's been hanging out with someone else? If he's got other friends? If he might be spending the night at somebody's house that we don't know? - No, Theo. Nothing's changed. - Listen, Levy, think. Think a bit if you remember anything... something... he might have done different, during the week. At school. Nothing? You don't remember? - Think, son. - I don't know, Levy, if you realize... just how serious this is. Pedro disappeared. Do you understand? He disappeared! - Branca, Branca. Levy. - Think back, son. Anything you remember might be important now. There is something, he asked me for... he wanted the address to my Uncle Abrão's store. - Who is your Uncle Abrão? - He has a computer store. He wanted to sell his computer. Didn't you say that he wanted to fix his computer? Yeah, he wanted to get it fixed. No, he said he wanted to sell it. - What are you talking about, Levy? - No, he wanted to fix his computer. - He told us that... - He told me he wanted to sell it, Theo. He tried to sell his computer to my uncle... but he didn't want to buy it. What did he want to sell his computer for? He said he needed money. Are you sure you got the right number? No, Theo. I don't know my own son's telephone number. - Call home, see if he's arrived. - I just called, Theo. We've got to go to the hospitals, police stations. - Make a list. - He told me he'd be back Sunday. - So he thought he'd be back on Sunday. - You're trying to find coherence... - in a lunatic's attitudes. - He's just a boy. - A lunatic, a lunatic. A lunatic. - He's fourteen. He's a boy, Theo. When I was his age, I was at home... taking care of my mother, alone. I was on the beach. Thank God. I'm going to call Cynthia. What Cynthia? The Secretary of Health. She can check out the public hospitals... we'll check out the private ones. Cynthia, it's Theo. I wouldn't be calling you at home, Cynthia, but it's... an emergency. It's Pedro, my boy. He's disappeared, Cynthia. Are you OK? I'm OK. Pedro? Pedro? Honey? Pedro? Son? Pedro are you home? Pedro, call me as soon as you get in. Theo... Hello. Please, is this Pedro Gadelha's house? On Catumbi... Street. What's this one called? See what it says. There. This is it. What's the number. It's 352. There. CENTER FOR ZOONOSIS CONTROL MONDAY TO FRIDAY FROM 9 AM TO 5 PM This is Relâmpago. He took Relâmpago. We like to call after a few days... to check in and see how the animal is getting along. It's just that it might take a while to adapt to new surroundings. A horse? He took a horse? Yeah, a great horse. He wasn't young, but still very strong. Pedro bought a horse? He adopted Relâmpago. What do you mean, adopted? He didn't pay for him, he took the animal... with the responsibility of taking care of it. It's a system we have. Where did he take the horse? - To his house in the country. - What house? - What country house? - He said he was... - taking it to his country place. - Pedro doesn't have... a house in the country. We don't have a country home. - If he lied... - He lied. If he didn't have the proper facilities to take care of the animal... - Excuse me. Let me ask you something. - that makes things worse, because... it goes against one of our basic norms... Please. Alright, let me ask you just one question. Did Pedro leave an address of this country house? - That's not necessary. - It's not necessary... My friend, how in earth did you let... a 15 year-old boy leave with a horse? -15? - Yeah, 15. What do you mean, 15? This makes things a lot worse. What's this? Pedro did this? This is false. Can't you see? Well, there's so many forms to fill in... - so many documents... - It's ringing. Wait. If your son falsified this, that would be fraud... - It's Pedro. - If he falsified... Hello, Pedro? Hello? Hello, who's talking? Who's talking? - Give it to me... - Hello. That's my son's phone. Who's talking? Hello? Hello? - Yes. - What is it, Theo? You think, or you saw? What did you see? - I'm going with you, Theo. - You go home. - No, no. I'm going with you, Theo. - Let me talk. - Listen, you have to... - I'm going with you, Theo! Branca, you have to go home. - No, I'm not going home. - Let me talk. Let me talk! - Let me talk. You have to... - No. Listen to me. You have to go home... because if Pedro comes back, if he calls... I need you to be at home, OK? - You have to go home. - Will you bring Pedro back? - Are you going to bring Pedro home? - Yes I am, I'll bring him back. Bring Pedro back to me, Theo! - Please, Theo! - I'll bring Pedro back home. - I'll bring him, OK? - Theo, bring Pedro back to me. OK, go on. Go on. Pedro? Hello? As soon as you get this message... Hey. It looks like an accident, huh? There are a bunch of shacks here. In this community. Who knows, somebody who lives here... might have seen something, understand? I wish I could be more helpful, but... Good luck. I hope you find your kid. Thanks a lot, OK? Good luck. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm looking for my son, he's just a kid. Did you see a boy come through here with a horse? No, I didn't. I didn't see anything. Thank you. Ma'am, please. I need some help. There was an accident nearby... either Saturday or Sunday, I think... I'm looking for my son. A boy. A 15 year-old boy, - maybe riding a horse­ - A black horse? A black horse, a black horse. Did you see it? - No. - But, it was a black horse. You said so. Did you see a boy on a black horse? I didn't see anything, but grandma did. - Your grandmother saw him? - Not my grandmother, Grandma. - Where does she live? - She lives over there. - Can you take me there? - But, now? Now, now. Please. He slept here, mister. Like a rock. - Malina, wake up. - Malina! - Malina! - It's mine! Get up! You can't do that. Didn't he tell you where he was going... or what he was doing with this horse? Didn't say anything, mister. Here, Quico, give him his bottle. - Listen ma'am... - He hurt his leg. He hurt his leg? Yeah, and I didn't have anything for it. - I gave him some tea. - Ma'am, just a second. How did he hurt his leg? It was scratched up very bad. Ma'am, could I ask you to hold it still just for a bit? Just a bit, please. Was he alright? He was alright, mister. He sleept, woke up, ate like a pig, grabbed his things and left. - Where did he go? - Only Beto would know that. - Who is Beto, ma'am? - Who is Beto? Beto is Beto, mister! Malina, take him over to Beto's place. - But, now? - Now! Let's go. Don't want it, don't drink it. Beto? - Beto! - I'm coming. OK, this is fine. - You see that road there? - That one? Yes! Follow it. That's where your boy went. Horses are made for dirt roads, not for traffic. The horse shied. I've seen lots of folks get killed by animals on the asphalt. Didn't he say anything about where he was going? Salvador. He's going to Salvador? No, Espírito Santo. Salvador or Espírito Santo? Salvador or Espírito Santo. That's it, without a doubt. One or the other, both down that road. Theo? Everything's OK, Branca. He's alright. No problem. He's alive. He's alive, Theo? He spent the night at this woman's house. I met her. He left early the next day. - She doesn't know where he's going. - He's OK? He hurt his leg... Just a scratch, a scratch. I don't know. I'm going to follow this road here. That guy doesn't know what he's talking about. First he says he's going to Bahia then, that he's headed to Espírito Santo. I mean... We just don't know, man. - Where is he headed? - Theo I... looked through his whole room, his computer isn't here. I don't know where it is. So, send him a message then. Send him a message, who knows, he might still have it and... - he answers. - Alright. You find him, OK? Find him and bring him home. Hey! Hey! Mister! Did you see a boy come through this way on a horse? - Yeah! - You saw him? - Yeah. - When did you see him? - He crossed yesterday. - Crossed to where? To the other side. How'd he cross? I crossed him. - In that? - Here. Him and the horse. Why? Could you cross...? Could you ferry...? Will that thing hold my car? Hold your car, for sure, but there's no way. Why? - The tide is low. - No, we can do it. We can do it. I'll help you. We can do it. - No way. - I'll help you. The two of us... We'll push. Can you make it here? Hold it. Listen ma'am, it's my son. The boy is my son. Please. Bring the boat over here, please? Please. I'll help you, the two of us. If you push here, it'll go. Look here. Back there, if you... Look. It's shallow here. Look here, if you... Mister, it's no use. If you just help me... If you help me, we can do it. It's just a matter of pushing here, look. If I put, if I put the pole... You got a dinghy or something? Did you talk to him? He asked me what horses eat. - He didn't know? - No. Did he tell you anything? Did he say where he was headed? Anything. He asked me for a discount for the horse. He didn't think that a horse had to pay the same as people. "Relâmpadu." - Did he say "relâmpago"? - Du. Relâmpago is the name of Pedro's horse. Did he say the horse's name? - "Relâmpadu." - Relâmpago. Relâmpago. Yeah, did you see the horse? Pedro's horse? Is this the boy with the horse you saw? But horses weigh more than people. If it had been anyone else, I'd charge the horse... near to what I'd charge for a car. He was broke? No, he had money. Then later, he wanted my cap. Offered me 20 reais for it. But I wouldn't sell my cap. - He wanted to buy that cap? - Yeah. - That one there? - Right. Want one? You guys live here on the boat? For a long time now. And that's your boy? Yeah. Pedro. Doesn't look like him. It's just that he's only... - How old is your boy? - Five. Yeah, five. Five, six... Younger. Don't look anything like the guy on the horse. He grew up. Hey. You can keep the tractor. Sorry for the trouble, I... - Where did you get that T-shirt? - Keep it. - Keep the tractor. - That T-shirt belongs to my boy. - I took it just for this one job. - Why are you running? - You can keep it. - Hey! - Keep it! - Hey! Hey! Where's my boy? Where's Pedro? Are you crazy? Are you from Town Hall? Mister, are you from the Town Hall? My boy. - Where's Pedro? - Let me go, let me go! - Are you crazy, shit? Are you crazy? - Where's my son? - Are you crazy, shit? - Where's Pedro? What Pedro? Where's Pedro? Where's Pedro? Pedro? The kid who owned this T-shirt? You are fighting me because of this fucking T-shirt! I thought you were from the Town Hall, shit! I traded this shirt with Pedro. The kid came by and traded me a bottle of pinga for it. For God's sake. I thought you were... He headed that way, down that road. Go on after him. You can catch up to him. Go on! They're here, Mrs. Branca. - What's that? - Tiles. What do we do with the tiles? WHERE ARE YOU? CALL HOME WE'RE DESPERATE... GIVE SOME SIGN PEDRO... Good morning. Did you, by any chance, see a kid come through here on a horse? Would you know where I can find a telephone around here? Ma'am? Good morning. Could you tell me where I might find a phone around here? - Telephone? - Telephone. A telephone here, only with Custódio. - Where does Custódio live? - Next door. This house here? Thank you. Custódio? - Good morning. - Good morning. Mr. Custódio, my name is Theo, Theo Gadelha. Your neighbor told me that you have a phone. I'm looking for my son, a boy... who's disappeared. He might have come through here, on a horse. Have you seen a boy coming by here on a horse? - A boy on a horse? - A boy on a black horse. Horses come by here all the time. I can't remember all the colors, right? Could you lend me your phone, please? I have to call my wife. Is it working? - What's wrong? - No credit. But, it won't be long, Mr. Custódio. I'll make it real quick. No, I can't run out of credit. My daughter doesn't like it. No problem. This is what we'll do... I'll give you some money and you buy some more credit. No. They don't sell it here. Where did you buy this credit? My daughter. Your daughter. So we'll give... I'll even get some more here. We'll give her more money. With this, you can even buy a new phone. My daughter only gets here on Friday. Mr. Custódio... - I really need your help. - I can't. I use a pacemaker. If there's any problem, I have to call my daughter. I know what we can do. Right, there's no problem. I'll just make a collect call. - You know what a collect call is? - No, no, no. I'll explain it to you... Just for you to understand. The call is collect, you don't pay. - You know what a collect call is? - It'd be better not to. Do you know what a collect call is? It'd be better if you just left. - That doesn't make any sense. - It would be better. - Are you trying to give me a hard time? - I already told you mister. My daughter wouldn't like it. And I already told you that you won't have to pay anything. Are you deaf? I'm not deaf, I have a heart condition. And you can leave now! I'll leave the money here. I need to find my son. I'm really sorry about this. You can buy a new phone. Are you crazy? Come back here! Hey, buddy! Stop! Stop! Come back here! Come back here, young man! Help me! Help me! Help me! Come back here! That's my phone! Stop! Stop! - Hello, Theo? - He's OK, Branca. He's OK. Believe me... - He crossed a river. - What river, Theo? A river... in a mangrove... He crossed on a ferry. I talked to the owner of the ferry. They guy told me that he talked to him, he had money and he was alright. He wanted to buy the guy's cap. - And he's alright? - Branca, I've met two people who have talked to Pedro already. He traded his T-shirt... He's fine. He's getting along. Find him for me. Bring him home. I'm going to take him home today. I'm getting close. I'm real close now. I'm on a hurry. Hey! Hey! Guy! Mister, mister. Please, please. Could you give us a lift? We ran out of gas. - Where are you going man? - I'm going to Mimoso. It's a festival, not far from here. - And what's going on there? - Lots of music, lots of rock. Very crazy. And guys, like your age, are going there? Yeah, basically, just people our age. And there are some friends of mine too. Hold on, let me call them. - Mimoso? - It's not far. You have to go through here. Hey, man. Are you going to do us this favor, give us a lift? - You'll take us to Mimoso? - Hold it. Where are you going? - Where am I going? - Yeah. - That's a good question. - You don't know? Do us a favor man. Take us to Mimoso. It's not far. - I'm looking for my son. - What do you mean? You lost him? I lost him. But, I'm going to find him. He's a kid your age. A bit younger. He's on a horse. On a horse. Man, he's going to Mimoso for sure. The Winter Festival. Filled with kids our age. Who knows, you just might find him there. - He's in Mimoso for sure man. - Let's go? Let's go? - Let's go to Mimoso. - Let's go guys. Let's go. Come on. Let's go to Mimoso.

Thanks a lot, really man. Let's go, let's go. Where are you guys coming from? - Belo Horizonte. - BH. - BH is very far from here, huh? - More or less. - Didn't take us long. - No big deal. And that car, whose father does it belong to? Mine. And you're going to just leave it in the middle of the road? It's all locked. No problem. - Nobody is going to steal it, no way. - I'm feeling bad. - So you just take it easy there. - That's what I'm doing. - Don't hassle me. - Are you OK? - He's feeling queasy. - Poor thing. Chocolate isn't very good if you're feeling queasy man. - You got chocolate man? - Give it to me. It's my chocolate. Want some? Thanks a lot, man. Thanks a lot. Really. Hi. Hi. I'm going to ask you Just one thing. Money. It's because I lost my purse... and I'll find it, but it's going to take some time. And I need a ham and cheese sandwich right now. - Ham and cheese? - Yeah, ham and cheese. I'm looking for my son. Man, this place is filled with sons. Take your pick. But my son is different. My son... My son has a black horse. A horse? No way. I was sure it was just some story. You mean that he really did come on a horse? Maura took a whole bunch... - of pictures with him. - Who's Maura? And you know how it is, not everything Maura tells me is... - Where is she? - At Patrick's. - Can you take me there? - Sure. But can you buy me a sandwich? Please, I'm starving to death. I took an acid yesterday and the festival is today... What? Don't tell me you've never done that? Thanks a lot for this sandwich, really. - Stop there, please. - At this gate here? I'll open it, you can park near the trailer. My bed. This guy lives here, this Patrick? Patrick was my French teacher at school. - You know São Fernando? - Yeah. During summer vacation, he bought a whole bag of acid and came to Mimoso. And, a couple bags later, he's still here. - Does your father know you're here? - Here, exactly, I sure hope not. - Let's go? - Let's go. They probably are in the river. - Patrick. - How's it going? - Ça va? - Ça va bien. - Ça va bien. - Ça va bien. Patrick, I'm Theo. Patrick. And so? - The girl... - Alice. - Alice. - Alice. She told me that my boy slept here, at your campground. - And who is your boy? - Pedro. Pedro? God! - How did he do that, huh? - The thing with the horse? - A whim. An insane trip. - I'd like to know that too. An insane trip. Is he around? Where is he? Is he still here? He left. This one doesn't work. Have to take it to... - He's already gone? - Yeah. Do you know where? He was in a hurry. Said he couldn't stay. I even joked around with him. I told him... "If you're in a hurry, going by horseback... isn't the fastest means of transportation, right?" But then I started thinking to get up... and leave before the party, he must have been in a hurry. - But, did he spend the night here? - Yeah, he spent the night. He bunked down in Maura's tent. The two of them got real cozy, you know? So cute. That's Maura. Maura! Stop it! Stop it! You creeps, no! Go there. No, no, no. Take me back. Man, it hurts so bad. Maura? My name is Theo. Pedro's father. You don't look like Pedro, do you? Cissa, take me back into the water, please. - Help me back into the river? - Aren't you cold? - No. My baby is going to be born. - No. I want him to be born in the river. - Are you cold? - Can you take me to the river? Your baby can't be born in the river. Yes, he can. I want... - to have him in the water. - No, no he can't. It's too cold. This girl has got to go to a hospital, Patrick. That'd be the São Pedro Hospital. Two hour drive from here. No, I'm not going to any hospital. No way! My boy is going to be born here! I want him to be... - Hold it, Maura, Maura. - Take me to the river! Hold it, let me talk with you. You can't have your baby in the river. You can't do that, understand? It's too cold. But I'm right here to help you, OK? I'm going to help you. I'm a doctor and I'm going to help you. - No. No doctors, no doctors. - No, no, no. No, doctor no. I'm Pedro's father. I'm Pedro's father. And look, we're right beside the river. The river is right here beside us. You don't need to get any closer. OK? Can you hear the water? Tell everyone to be quiet, everyone. Hey guys, move back.

"I've always thought that the less you have, the less you lose. So, all I had was a horse. An old horse, not much good for anything. But then, my horse died." Hold it! Wait! Wait a second! Hold it! - Branca? - Theo, it's me, Branca. Theo, he went to his grandfather's place. Pedro went to your father's house. He went to Espírito Santo, to your father's country place. He and your father were sending each other drawings. They've been in touch, they've talked to each other. For a long time now. Theo, pay attention. Write it down. Listen, it's... Ponta Negra, Km 187. Did you get that? Theo, this is about Pedro now, OK? The rest is the rest. You can see about that later. Can you hear me? Get in the car. I'm taking you to the hospital. Where's my car? What were you doing in the middle of the road like that? I have to find my boy. Your boy can wait. I'm taking you to a hospital. No. I'm going to find my son. - Can you drive? - I think I broke a rib, if you have any type of cloth, a bandage, an old sheet. You have scissors? Thank you. When you find your boy, take him home. Don't say anything, just take him home. It was him... My boy, who drew this. - Your boy? - Yeah. Pedro. My son. Some kid came here, starving to death. Flat broke. So I made a deal with him. - Would you sell it to me? - No. This is you here, right? Yeah. The kid is good, got talent. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, bro, who do you think I am? I'm real close. I think I'll catch him up in half and hour now. And how is he? Is he OK? I just talked to this guy and he said that he was great, I mean, hungry as hell, and traded a plate of food... for one of his drawings, Branca. The drawing is great. It's a guy surrounded by women, you know... the type you see in garages, these pinups. I offered to buy it, but he didn't want to sell it. He really liked the drawing. I'm close. Close. - I'll catch him up soon. - That's so good to hear, Theo. Branca... I love you. I love you. Kisses. And this motorbike here? Want a make a deal? What's wrong, buddy? An accident. Animal on the road. Pedro. BEACH Hi, dad. Theo. Is that you? Someone gave you a good beating, huh? A few. You see? It's amazing, don't you think? He draws. Your son draws. He's like me. He's very good. Yeah, I didn't know. I'm as deaf as a door. I can't hear you. If you want to cuss me out, it'll have to be face-to-face. Go on. I didn't know that Pedro knew how to draw. I can't hear you, I don't understand. Nothing, forget it. He draws. I wrote Pedro a letter... and sent him a drawing of my face. Well, I never thought that he'd answer. And he sent me a drawing and a letter. I thought he was such a... so... So I... I started thinking... you have such a good kid like that, such a great kid... I imagined if you didn't think... of all the things I lost with you... and let me be the boy's grandfather. He crossed two states just to meet you. I don't understand. I can't hear you. Pedro rode through two states on a horse... to meet you. On a horse? He came on horseback? Are you sure? On a horse? He brought me a horse. He did. THIS MOVIE IS DEDICATED TO CHRIS RIERA.
