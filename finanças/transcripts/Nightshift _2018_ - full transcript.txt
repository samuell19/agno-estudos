Subtitles by explosiveskull Help me, please! Please help me! Come on! Help me, please! - Yes? - Hey, Amy, um, I didn't think I'd get a chance to talk to you before you went to college. Well, you got me. What's up? Look, when I came down, all the lights were left on again. Fuck. I know you don't like the dark but it's gonna kill the electricity bill. I know. I'm sorry, I just... I really don't like the dark. Look, I'm really... I'm not trying to give you a hard time or anything, but, like, can you not just stand outside the room and just reach in and switch off the light? Yeah, I'll try it. Look, I'm sorry, I've just... I've always been that way. But I'm... I'm starting that new job tonight, so I'll pick up anything extra on the bill, I'll have some extra cash. Great. Thanks, Amy. Have a good day in college. Thanks, you too. - See you. - Bye Professor? Oh, it's Abby, the American student, yeah? Half Irish, half American. And it... it's Amy. Of course, I'm James. We don't really do the professor thing here. What can I do for you? Uh, you said something in class today about picking an artist or a creator to study and I wanted to pick somebody from Limerick. That's a good approach. Well, there's been a lot of good, creative people in Limerick. Uh, Frank McCourt, the writer... Richard Harris, Hollywood actor. But everybody knows about these people already. If you really want to get a feel for the city, go in and talk to the people, listen to their stories. You might even discover Limerick's next great creator. That's a good idea. Do you have any recommendations where I could start? Now, if I told you that I'd end up grading my own work, wouldn't I? But it's a city with a great history. Battles have been waged here, great art has been made, but some fairly horrible things have happened, too. Just... don't go down the easy route and end up writing about some pretty sculpture you found in a gallery. Give me something different, okay? Okay. Thanks... James. Oh, um, I will probably be... a bit late to class in the morning. What is it about students and early starts? Wednesday's hardly a session night, is it? No. No, I'm not going out. I, um... I got a new job and its night shifts. - Oh, so you're on the other side of the bar? - Not quite. I'm still dealing with people but it's the Limerick Hotel. Oh, wow... If you really want to get to know... Sorry just a sec... - Don't be too late. - Okay, thank you. Yeah. - Hey, honey. - Hey, Mom. Oh, we miss you so much. I've only been gone a month. Ha, a month away from your parents in Ireland. - We miss you. - I know. - I guess I miss you both too. - Very funny, missy. So how are you finding your cousins? Are they nice? Yeah. Yeah, they're nice, I like them. It's taken me a while to figure everything out. They've got slang words for everything over here. But no, I like them. Now you know how I feel. Thirty years with your father and I'm just now understanding that accent. So have you started your new job yet? Uh, no. I start tonight at ten. General duty night staff. Oh, that's very late. No, no. Um, I finish at six and then... I'm not in college till one, so it's fine. - Okay, good. - I'm tough, like you. I'm so proud of you, honey. We all are. Thanks, mom. I love you. New girl... Hey... Hey... new girl. - Yes. Hey, sorry. Hi, I'm Amy. - Adam. Let me show you the ropes. - Right, this is your guest phone. - Mm-hmm. This is the outside phone. We more than likely won't be using the outside phone, unless some crazy old one wants to book a room in the middle of the night. All we have to do is answer these two phones, bring stuff up to guests if they want it and just... - tidy up. - Okay, sure. There's not many here tonight so it should be easy enough. - Great! - So... - You're an American girl? - Yes, I am. I couldn't tell whether you were a Yank or a Canuck. I can never tell the difference between the... the accents. Right. I'm sorry, that's like when people say, "Is Ireland still part of UK?" Isn't it? Well, it... it depends on... on who... who we're talking to, I suppose... Very clever. So what are you doing in Ireland other than contesting our independence? - Um, I'm studying for an arts degree. - Hmm. Have you worked here long? Oh... Too long. Ever since they reopened. Oh, you're up. Hello, reception. Yes. Yep, that's no problem. I'll get those up to you in a couple of minutes. Okay, thank you. There you go, the call with the nuclear launch codes. What do they want? Um, room 537 wants some extra towels. Bet ya he's an old lad. Let me see, 5-3-7... Yep... an old lad. I knew it. They always want new towels for some reason. I... I don't want to ask. Well, what are you waiting for? - Uh, towels are? - Oh that's right, uh, okay. This is your swipe card. This will open up all the doors, it's right through there. - Okay. - Take this with you. I'll call you if you get stuck. Right, okay. Jesus. Why do I have to be the one to get them? You gotta speak into the walkie. I can see you on camera now, I got you. Why are you acting so nervous? Is it the hotel? No, I just don't really like being down here on my own. Wait, what do you mean, the hotel? It's history, the... the murders. - Very funny. - No, they're real. - It was a while ago but... - Adam, stop. Oh, come on. It happened a long time ago. It had to be close... Boo! For next time. Are we good? One goes up, one goes down. It's, uh, slow and annoying. This is where you say something clever like, er, "So are you," you know... slow and annoying. That's not clever. Hello? This is Amy from reception, I have your towels. Sir? - Hey, Adam? - Yep. This guy's not answering. Just leave them outside the door for him. Yeah, but... he's mumbling and he's not talking when I call him. - And? - What if he's not okay? I'm... I'm sure he's fine, what if he's... watching TV or just on the phone, or... doing something nasty in the bathroom? Remember, don't ask about the towels. Just leave them there. He'll get up and get them when he's ready. Fine. Oh, good. Um... Here are your towels. Fuck it! Your turn in a minute. Where are you getting all these nuts? The minibar supply room. You just take them? Who do you think actually eats these from the mini bar? Huh? Nobody. I mean, who's gonna spend a fiver on a shitty bag of nuts? So you just take them? Well... They keep buying them... I'm going to keep eating them. Oh! Well, shit. - Hey, sir. - Hello, sir, how can I help you? Yeah, I'd like a room for tonight, please. Of course. If you could just fill this out here. Can you excuse me just for one moment? Okay. So... go in the back, get some peanuts and stuff from the mini bar supplies, okay? What? If we make a fuss out of him, he's not going to tell the day staff tomorrow about the mess. Fine. Thank you. And... this is your key card. And the room number's right there, we've upgraded you to the suite, free of charge. And, um, here are some... gifts, to say sorry about the delay. Complementary, of course. No, thanks. The, um, the stairs are over here. Slow and annoying right? Slow and annoying... Yeah. Did you, uh... notice anything strange about that guy? Not really. I guess he's checking into a hotel in the middle of the night with no reservation. No, that's not it. He didn't have any luggage. Jesus, put a lid on that, quick. Will you bring that downstairs? Hello, reception. Yes, I... I think we might. Uh, I'll just check in the lost and found. I'll bring one up to you. Is that okay? Okay, sir, thank you. Bye. It was your man from earlier. He's looking for a phone charger. I'll have to check in the lost and found. Will you bring that down to the big bins please? - That's fucking disgusting. - Yeah, I know. Where am I going? Same as the service room, just turn right. - Is it dark too? - No, no. There's lights. Whoa, whoa, Jesus! What happened? There's somebody out there. He chased me, he attacked me! What? Are you okay? Did he do this to you? No, I tripped into it. Oh. He didn't touch you or anything? - No. No, he chased me. - What does he look like? He... he was pale, he... he had a scraggly beard thing. - He's filthy. - Yeah, he's filthy. Yeah, it's that fucking homeless guy again. No. No, this guy was scary, like there was something really wrong with him. Amy, I'm telling you. This isn't the first time he's done this. He goes through the bins looking for stuff that the... the guests leave behind. I'll look after this, okay? Why don't you just go up to one of the empty rooms, clean yourself up, okay? Here, look... Uh, room 509 is empty. Just go up there, clean yourself off, relax. I'll have a cup of tea for you when you come down, okay? Are you sure? Are you gonna be okay on your own? Yes, trust me. We're practically arch enemies at this point. Here we go. All right, Fuck-o. Ah, Jesus Christ! Dirty bastard. Three more hours. Adam? Adam? If that's not you, you better get up here quick. Hello? Hello, if you're not a guest here, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Jesus Christ! I'm sorry I thought that that... I thought that guy got in. You gotta stop this shit. I told you I'd get rid of him, he never comes in here. Okay, Jesus. Sorry, I... Where were you coming from? Really? I was looking for the wet floor sign, you happy? I think there's one in the service room. Right. Well, I'll go get it to save all the drama. Let's just take a break and have a cup of tea, sound good? All right. - So did you find him? - No. But the gate is open so he must've left. Look, he's been here since before I started working here, he's harmless. He just gets stuff out of the bin from the kitchen, you know, junk and stuff. - He wouldn't hurt you, - He chased me, Adam. Yeah, well... I don't know. Right. You have not experienced Ireland until you've had a cup of tea, and some of these. I know you've had a shitty first day, but it's not always like this. We've a pretty easy job, you know. I looked it up. - What? - The murders. What'd you do that for? You don't need to know that shit... I thought you were just trying to give me a hard time. - I didn't think it actually happened. - Now you know. I just... I don't understand how they could open this place again. People forget... Tourists don't know their history. It's pretty easy when there's money involved. It's horrible. I mean that elevator... I know. You know... that was the only thing they didn't replace, during the refitting. It's too expensive, you know? I mean they cleaned it, and they... put new tiles and stuff, but they, uh... - they didn't put a new one in. - So there's still stuff - from the murders in the hotel? - Oh, no. No. Anything with blood on it was taken away, which was pretty much everything. They... they re-did the carpets, re-wallpapered the walls. They even had a priest come in and bless the place. - Why did they do that? - It's Ireland. You have to go to confession if you take a shite. Yeah, but why blessed though? Do you really want to know? Mm-hmm. Okay. Well... When they were taking the bodies out, they noticed all these... markings on the skin. He'd cut the insides out of his victims and covered himself in some sort of... ritual. Of course, the church went mad, tried to cover it up, but... someone's uncle's cousin knew one of the priests involved in the blessing and then... Now you know. What about the guy? - It said they never found him. - Oh, nobody knows where he is. Everyone has their theory, you know? Some of the more outlandish ones involve aliens coming down and opening some portal to hell. Another one is that he was hiding here and then died in the walls. Great. I know. They're all bullshit. What I think happened is that he killed the last one in the elevator... then nothing. The gates of hell didn't open and welcome him in, he didn't ascend into some higher power, nada. He just panicked, you know, he cleaned the stuff off himself and walked out the door. And now he's living somewhere, working some shitty job, waiting to ascend. It just... doesn't feel right being here. Something feels off about the place. Amy... You're working the night shift. I mean this happens, you're tired. It affects people in different ways. I mean, it is a pretty big hotel. Lightbulbs go, doors creak, you just... have to get over it. Are you serious? I've had the night from hell, I've been... chased and scared and... covered in shit that was no doubt left there from your last shift. Not to mention you have me doing all the legwork, while you sit on your ass and play with peanuts. And after all this shit, I'm still here. Yeah, I think that's getting over it. No, I'm getting on with it. Right. Okay, okay, okay. I know it's not very fair of me. - No its not. - Well, look... I'll stop giving you a hard time and I'll pick up the slack. I... I was just trying to get you up to speed with the place. I think I'm up to speed. In all fairness... I'd be fairly spooked if it was my first day. It's fine. We're good. Great. So what's the etiquette, then? Is it a dunk? Or do you sip and bite, or? Well that's not the question you need to ask yourself. What you need to decide is whether you're a bag in, or a bag out, kind of girl. Okay, so, how about this. I'll sweep the floor, I'll scrub it, and I'll be on tea duty for the next two and a half hours, how about that? Finally making sense. - Hello? - Hey, Mom. Oh, Amy, sweetheart, are you all right? Ugh, I don't know. Just... having a really tough day here... Night. Honey, I know it's hard. It must be the middle of the night there, right? Oh, it's not that, I'm just... Some homeless guy got into the hotel and he chased me, and then I fell and ruined my uniform. And the guy I'm working with, he keeps trying to scare me. I'm just... done. I just wanna go home. Listen, honey. Don't let this guy scare you. You're better than this Normally I wouldn't, but... I looked up what he said and there was some pretty bad murders here, like ten years ago. - What? - I know. They shut the place down it just reopened a couple years ago. Oh. Well I don't blame you for being scared, then. I don't know, this place isn't worth the extra cash. Look, all you gotta do is make it through the night, and ask to be changed to the day shift in the morning. I guess. Thanks, Mom. I love you. No problem, honey. I love you too. Just do me a favor, call me in the morning... Just make it through the night. Stay awake. Wait until morning. You got this. Hello, reception. Um, no, sir, we haven't forgotten about you, um, just one sec. Charger? Shit. Uh, check the box. Just one sec, sir. I think, uh... Yeah, we have one. I'll bring that straight up to you. - Away I go. - No, it's fine. I'll go. I'm falling asleep here anyway. - You keep cleaning. - Are you sure you'll be okay? Yes, I'll be fine. Don't forget your walkie talkie. You better believe it. This guy's weird, I'll be calling you. Oh, hey. Adam said we were the only ones working tonight. I'm Amy. I'm on reception. Miss? Miss? Miss? - Sorry. Um, here you go. - Thanks. Wait... This won't work, it isn't Irish. We have three pins, not two. Shoot. Um, I actually know a way to make it work. Can I try? Now, sir. Thanks for that. I appreciate the trouble you've gone to. It's no problem. - I've had one hell of a day. - Same here. It's my first shift. I'm just trying to get used to all the night time stuff. Looks like neither of us are going to get any sleep tonight then. Oh, I personally cannot wait to fall into bed and just... pass out. What has you still awake? My wife is leaving me. I just had to get up and get out, I'm too wound up to sleep. I'm really sorry to hear that. Amy, are you all right? No inappropriate touching, I hope. Yes, Adam. I'm fine, thank you. I'm really sorry about him. He's a bit of an ass. Yeah, I got that. Thanks for the charger. Look if you need anything else, don't hesitate to contact the front desk. Yeah. Hey, Adam? All the lights are off up here. Just... keep your cool. I'll stay here with you until you're in the lift, all right? I'm okay. I think the maid must've turned it off on her way down. A guest, is it? No, I... I met a maid. She didn't really say anything though. There's no maid on tonight. No, I definitely saw her. Hmm, I'll just make double sure on the roster. Please. Help me. She's bleeding. Amy? Hello? Please, help. She's dying. Get the towels. You need to hold it to her neck, like this. Amy? Hello, Amy? Adam, Adam you've got to call an ambulance, there's a woman bleeding, she's dying. What the fuck is going on? Call an ambulance now! - What's going on? - Oh my God. Help, please. Please, she's bleeding! What the fuck is wrong with you? - Amy, answer me. - Come on! - Amy? Hello? - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Can you hear me? Amy! For Christ's sake, talk, hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Amy? Amy? What's going on? What's going on, Amy? Adam? Adam, something's happening. There... was a man here and a woman, and now they're gone, and... the woman was bleeding and I... I don't know, but the maid had cuts on her back. Amy, what are you talking about? I need to go, Adam. This fucking lift! Adam, please call the police. Somebody stabbed the woman. Call the police. The... stairs, Amy. Amy, go for the stairs! What? This makes no sense, this make no... Help! Adam? What? Fuck. S... Somebody, please help. Hey, Adam. Sorry I fell asleep. Adam, are you there? - Yeah, Amy. - Hey, what time is it? What does it matter? Hilarious. Seriously, what time is it? He's coming for you. Adam, that's not funny. Stop. He's almost there, Amy. Ooh! Well, Amy, it would seem that you're the one in danger. Is that... Is that him? Is that him I hear outside your door? - Adam, stop it! - He's coming to kill you, unless you're already dead. It's not me, it's him. Amy, help me. It's not me, it's him. Help me! Get away from me. - No, no. No, no. - Please, please, I didn't do anything! Listen to me! My name's Pete. I'm here to help you. - What? - We're trapped in the hotel. What is going on? That thing that happened those ten years ago, that was just the beginning. I was one of his last victims. This isn't real. I can assure you it's very real. Look, I'm trapped, I'm in a cycle that I'm forced to re-live. I'm dead? No, no. You're not dead, not yet. - I'm here to help you. - Why? Because I know the horrors that these rooms hold. No, no. That's... that's not going to work in here - Listen, what's your name? - Amy. Okay, Amy, do you know anybody? Who's the last person you spoke with? Um... Uh, the... The old man and the woman. No good. They're like me, we can't help 'em. Um... There's a guy in room 530. Okay, room 530, okay. We're gonna go to his room, and we're going to get him. No, no, no, we need to stay in here until the cops come, Adam called them. That's not gonna happen, we're not in the living world. We're somewhere kind of in between. Listen, you need to come with me. I'm going to get you out of here. Whatever you hear, just keep moving. What did I say? Come on. - What the hell is going on? - We're trapped in the hotel. What do you mean trapped? Who the hell are you? You need to listen to me. I'm one of the already dead. I want to stop you from becoming like me. What? Jesus Christ. Now do you want to live, or do you want to die? We're running out of time. Okay? - Okay. - Okay then. This happens in a cycle. The only way for you two to escape is through the lift. That's where the final victim was killed. You try to stop him and it all resets again and we're back to where we started. What happened that night, is already happening again, it's well underway. The final victim, she's gonna bang on all the doors as she's being chased. Then she's going to press the button for the lift. Only she can call it. - That is how you escape. - What about you? I can't go. I've got my part to play in all of this. Jesus Christ, this thing is dead. That won't work, not in here. What do you mean it won't work, not in here? Look, I just about had enough of the two of you. All I wanted, was a room, for the night, on my own. And the next thing the two of you come barging in here. Look, I've had enough, get out. Get out! Get out! Adam? Adam, can you hear me? Adam? Amy? Amy, are you there? Yes. Yes, Adam, I'm here. What the fuck is going on? I don't know, we're trapped there's somebody after us... Did you really think that was going to work? You're stuck, you stupid bitch. - Why are you doing this? - It's not me. It's the big guy himself from all those years ago. Now what are you going to do? It's just a little wait, and then the real fun begins. Listen to me, you sick bastard! - I don't know why you're doing this... - Stop talking now! Oh, the homeless fucker is there, well that changes everything. Why did you do that? We could have used that to call somebody else! - That's not even your friend. - What? Ah, shit. - Help me, please! - What is that? - The last victim. - Please help me! You've changed the cycle. If we leave her out there, you're all dead. - Help me, please! - She'll draw him straight here. Wait here. Please help me! You've gotta help me. He took my boyfriend and he tried to kill me... Shh! You've gotta be quiet, or he'll find us, okay? Shh. Why doesn't she remember like you? She's stuck in her loop. Sometimes it happens to me, too. What did you mean before when you said I changed the cycle? You altered the timeline. That voice wasn't your friend, it was him. He knows I'm helping you, that's the reason why she's appeared here. - It's like a way of the timeline bouncing back. - Dammit. Listen, I'll guide you through this. Just follow me, and do what I say. We need to go to a room where the murders didn't take place, it makes it a little harder for him to follow us. I'll go first... and you follow across the hall, three doors down. No, I can't go back out there. - Don't make go back out there... - What's your name? - Laurie. - Laurie, okay, you stay with me. Okay, you can hold my hand. I have the master key and we'll outrun him all night if we have to, okay? You stay with me. Okay, let's go. - Go. - The key won't work. I'll hold him off, you know what to do. - We can't leave you. - No, you can't save me. - Daddy. - Don't look, honey. I... I'm scared. Back to the start. No! Dad! No... So what do we do now? - I don't know. - What about the windows? They only open a few inches, we tried them already. If we can't get out, we'll... we'll get a message out. Wait, won't that change things again? I don't know. I told Adam to call the cops, but... I don't even know if that was really him. We just have to... hope it works. We're sitting ducks here. - We need to move. - Where? - What? - Where? Where are we gonna go? Just stop! Stop for a second, let me think. Pete said that we... need to play it out till the end... wait for Laurie to call the elevator. I'm not following. We need to go to the room closest to the elevator, and then Laurie, you call it, and then... we wait in the room until it comes. Why does it have to be me? - It just has to be that way. - I'm not going. Look Laurie, I know it's not fair. Okay? But that's just how it has to be. - I'm going to help you. - No. - Laurie. - No. Do you want to get out of here or not? We'll all go. Okay. Something's not right, we need to go. Quick, hide. No, no! No. No, no, Amy! Amy! Help me! No! Help me! No! No! No! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. No! No! No, no. No, no, no! No! No! No! No. No. No. Why are you doing this? Because... I take my job... very... very seriously. Adam? As you live and breathe. Well... It's you... It's you from the front desk! Oh... you remembered me. Must have made an impression. You see... it's not about recreating the murders. That's not why we're here. We're creating a whole new story, something... that will live on, beyond us all. Something like me. You sick fuck! You drew us here! You made it happen like this! No. No. No! Can't you see? It's not about this body. It's not about this, I am more than this. He is just a vessel. Sit down, don't be stupid, sit the fuck down. Oh, here we go. I'm not going to beg you, you piece of shit! I don't need you to. Don't worry, ladies, not one drop will be wasted. Please. - Please, please! - Come on, you need to hit the elevator. Laurie, come on! I'm not stupid. If he catches you, I can get away. I can change the cycle. I'm sorry. Don't move. Amy, what the fuck? Police! Drop your weapon! Put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! Ma'am, drop the weapon! We're armed! No, no. It's... it's him you need. It's... It's him, it's not me. It's him! - You have to get out. - Just make it through the night. Amy! Help me! Stay awake. He killed them all! Wait till morning. I had to stop him! - You can't save me. - We'll all go. I'm free now! No. Please, please, no. You try to stop him, and it all resets again, and we're back to where we started. I'm sorry, Amy. Welcome. Subtitles by explosiveskull
