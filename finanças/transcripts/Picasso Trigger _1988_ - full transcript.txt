(waves rustling) (birds chirping) (guns firing) (dynamic music) (fast tense music) (birds chirping) (light knocking) Come in. Is that the package from Miguel Ortiz? Yes sir. Open it. (ominous music) (speaking in a foreign language) The plan is in motion. Within the next 24 hours the federal agents responsible for the death of my brother Luca Ortiz will be dead. With your leadership, your support, we have taken the first step towards complete revenge. Your participation is most appreciated. To have your soldiers in Texas eliminate a man we both consider a dangerous enemy is a pleasure to say the least. I am forever in your debt. We are prepared to strike in Las Vegas and Hawaii tonight. (speaking in a foreign language) (birds chirping) (fast tense music) (crowd applauding) The Picasso Trigger as painted by world-renowned artist Guillermo Esteban is a creature conceived in beauty who protects his life with a fierce brutality seldom experienced by most men. My recent brush with death necessitated a long recuperative period where I spent many hours staring at this masterpiece. I came to the conclusion that it represented a philosophy that I wanted to express. Man must learn from God's creatures to protect all that is beautiful with every force, every resource, every breath that he takes. I, therefore, donate this painting to the people of Paris and to the world. (group applauding) (people chattering) The last time you created a media event you were indicted by the grand jury. A multi-million dollar endowment bridges the gap between outlaw and philanthropist. It's amazing how just a few million dollars allows them to ignore that the Picasso Trigger is actually your code name. Art has many faces. I need this time to fulfill my dreams with no inhibitions, no obstacles. I want you to share this freedom I have. You sound like a man who's nearing his end. No, nearing a new beginning. Youll be around forever. One can only hope. (ominous music) (rifle firing) (dramatic music) (people screaming and shouting) (lively music) (birds chirping) (phone ringing) Yeah? Travis, partner, this is Uncle Longgone calling from Dallas. You still on that beautiful boat? You bet. Living good is the best revenge. Shoot, when I was your age, I'd made $5 million in the oil business. Spent 80% of it on good whiskey, fast cars, and faster women. Another 20% I just pissed away. Is this a social call? The Picasso Trigger is dead. Natural causes no doubt. Yeah, considering his lifestyle, a bullet in the chest. Any clues to who did it? No, so stay alert. We don't know what'll happen next.

We give 'em out to all our customers. Oh great. Well, thank you very much. - There you go. You're welcome. You get one, too. (helicopter whirring) Let's go, Fred. The homing device is in the lapel flower. Let's do it. (dynamic music) Hey it's a long drive to the Palm Springs office. I think I'll take the back roads and make some real time. Yeah, if our car can make it. Look, the agency wanted us to look like a couple of real polyester hicks. Well, they went all the way. (dynamic music) [Radio Announcer] On the international scene, in Paris, France today, Alejandro Philippe Salazar was gunned down on the steps of the new Contemporary Museum. His recent pacemaker implant surgery was believed to be the motivation for his multi-million dollar endowment. His passion for art was expressed in his incredible collection of Picassos, Monets, Chagalls and Esteban. - Ah, gimme a break, his troops have smuggled in more nose candy in this country than anyone. - Salazar's death has every indication of being a professional hit. His past... I wonder who nailed the bastard. [Radio Announcer] From United States - government agent, - Oh, I don't know. to international crime lord. Mr. Salazar's body will be flown immediately to his native land of Spain (helicopter whirring) where his remains (tense music) will be cremated. [Agent] Gee, what the hell's that? [Agent] What? Damn, that chopper's got a bazooka! What? [Agent] Well, get off the road or something! [Agent] I see 'em, I see 'em! [Agent] Gonna hit us! [Agent] All right, all right! [Agent] Where's my gun? Shit! [Agent] We're screwed! (tires screeching) (guns firing) Son-of-a-bitch is gonna shoot us. Yo, geez! (bazooka firing) (agents screaming) (explosion booming) (fire crackling) (glass shattering) The ones with the flower (tense music) have been scattered this hour. Let's go. (helicopter whirring) (gentle jazzy music) Thank you. (chuckling) [Man] Edy, you're the reason they call Molokai the friendly island. How sweet, thank you. Is everything to liking, Mr. Ortiz? It couldn't be better, Edy. Mr. Ortiz enjoyed his meal immensely. (fingers snapping) What did I say, huh? Give flower leis to those two. Yellow is their favorite color. Thank you. Here's your change. - No, no, keep it. Oh thank you very much. (crickets chirping) Here's a gift for you. [Susan] Oh, thank you. You're welcome. For you. Thank you very much. (crickets chirping) (tires screeching) Larry, Susan, I hate to say goodbye. You've been very helpful us, Edy. Now that we've done the legwork, we can let the agency decide how to proceed. There's definitely something in the air. I can feel it. (pager beeping) The ones with the flower have been scattered this hour. Glen and Peter have scored. Let's do it, now! (tense music) Good night, you guys. Good night, Edy. Thank you for everything. Good night. Let's go for a little walk on the beach. [Larry] Hmm, sounds good to me. (ominous music) (gun firing) Larry! (dramatic music) (gasping) (guns firing) (Susan grunting) That's two for our side. Give 'em a lei, (computer beeping) blow 'em away. (laughing) A hell of a poet, Clay. I know. (waves crashing) (pager beeping) Give 'em a lei, blow them away. Next stop on this tour, Maui, seven miles across the bay. We'll put a stop to that squealing bitch who testified against my brother. (gentle music) (Donna sighing) Come on, sleepy head. No delays today. Okay, I'm up. Good, you know we can't be late this morning. No problem. (gentle music) (upbeat music) [Donna] This is the fun part of agency work. [Taryn] Sure beats dodging bullets. [Donna] Let's go. [Taryn] I'm ready. (tense music) Hondo, what do you think? (chuckles) Clayton, you've got style. (Clayton laughing) (tense music) Ah, what a good morning. Yeah, it's beautiful. I'm sure Jade will appreciate these samples. Let's start this little puppy. (airplane humming) It's a shame we gotta waste a couple of good-looking broads. They've been nothing but trouble. Yeah. [Donna] Hey Taryn, check that out. It's like a little miniature Molokai Cargo plane. (radio beeping) Yes, Mr. Ortiz, I read you loud and clear, sir. Do it! (tense music) It'll be sweet revenge for me. (ominous music) [Donna] That is adorable. But why is it circling our boat? [Taryn] I don't know. It's getting awfully close. [Donna] It's gonna hit it! (explosion booming) [Donna] No, man! My god! Oh, my god, look! Look at our boat, Donna. That could've been us. (men shouting) We better get back to our plane. (birds chirping) He's going to the barn. Let's go. Get in, partner. Lopez. While I brush down on Dealer here, why don't you take the Jeep and go up to the house and bring us some coffee and sandwiches? (speaking in a foreign language) (Jeep rumbling) (dramatic music) (explosions booming) (horse whinnying) (fire crackling) Travis it's LG. Now listen and listen tight. Someone tried to kill me this morning. They think I'm dead so I'm laying low. I'm gonna need you over here to help me with this. You start tonight. Female agent's arriving from Paris. She'll be at Dallas by the time you arrive. Her name is Pantera. She spent the last couple of years undercover with Salazar and she knows all the players. Show her some hospitality Texas style. I'll be on the next plane out. No, it's too public. Contact the Professor and take his private jet. I'm gonna plug into Washington with my computer. And meet me tomorrow morning at Big Pines Lodge on Cattle Lake. I'll have full dossiers for you by then. Adios. Travis, keep your seatbelt on. [Travis] I'll try. Here, take care of that. Good luck. Charlie, take good care of him. [Charlie] You bet, sir. When I get you home you are in for a bumpy ride yourself. Well, I think I have some instruments to take care of that problem. Oh, I love it when you talk dirty. (jet roaring) (birds chirping) (horn honking) [Donna] Hey, hey hold up. - Hey, wait, wait stop. - Hey! [Taryn] Hey, can we have a lift? Where you (speaking in a foreign language) heading? [Taryn] To the Sugar Cane Train. Hop in, let's go. [Donna] Okay. (lively music) (speaking in a foreign language) Bye. (train bell ringing) (train chugging) Who do you think would want us dead? Could be any number of people. You don't think they cracked my cover, do ya? No, impossible. The federal government wouldn't allow that to happen to you. I sure hope you're right. (train clattering) (train chugging) (bell ringing) (train horn tooting) So, what do you think? That blonde looking over here, I think he likes me. Well, he's not bad looking. I might just make my move. Is that a snorkel in his pocket or is he just happy to see me? (laughing) (train horn tooting) [Donna] It's a snorkel, Taryn. I'm having a bad day. (train horn tooting) (suspenseful music) (seal barking) (airplane rumbling) What a trip, huh? When we came to Maui I expected a brief vacation but not this brief. Yeah, the boat rental people are gonna be pissed. (both laughing) (plane rumbling) (lively music) [Airport Announcer] Welcome to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Passengers arriving on flight number 321 from Paris should proceed to carousel number seven.

(ominous music) [Park Announcer] Sea Life Park is very proud to introduce to you our Atlantic and Pacific bottlenose dolphins to Whaler's Cove. They have a special way of saying welcome to our show. (plane rumbling) Honolulu Tower this is November niner niner 786. Can you patch me into Jade at Sea Life Park please? (people cheering) [Park Announcer] Today, we'd like to show you the Hawaiian way, the way of aloha. (speaking in a foreign language) The light and providing sea. (pager beeping) Our dolphins have a special way of saying welcome to our show. Yes? I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is the samples you sent for, they're safe. Bad news is the boat we were on has been blown up. I think somebody's trying to kill us. Where are you now? We're on our way back to Molokai. Do you know where Travis is? He had to go to Dallas on agency business. He tried to reach you. Check with me when you arrive at your base. Roger, over and out. (tense music) (dynamic music) (doorbell ringing) (sultry music) [Pantera] Welcome Mr. Abilene. You are Agent Pantera? Pantera's the name they've given me. You gonna stand there all night with your mouth open or would you like to come in. Um... How long has it been? You were captain of the football team and I was just another one of your conquests. No no no no. You were special. So were you. This place is furnished in wall-to-wall money. Putting my life on the line for the government has had its upside. What's the downside? I'm practically immune to emotion. Make yourself at home. There's wine on the table and I'll be right out. (Travis grunting) I see you've met Samson. Yeah. I trust him and if he likes you, I like you. Cat's crazy about me. Seems that way. (Samson purring) You ready? (Samson meowing) Always. Uh, excuse me, the front door is this way. I knew that. (upbeat country rock music) You look great. (people chattering) I do the best I can with what I have. Yeah (chuckles). Unless I'm nobody should have a body like that. You have some pretty strong points yourself. [Travis] Is that a fact? (slow country music) I've thought about you. [Travis] Really? A lot. Do you remember the weekend LG left town? We snuck into his place. Sure. We slept in the living on the floor in front of the fireplace. You know I had rug burns on my rear for a week. (Travis chuckling) It was worth it. Why did we ever break up? I told you Karl Jones asked me to marry him. [Travis] And? And you said, "I hope the two of you "will be very happy together." I didn't mean it. Well, why didn't you say no no you can't? I love you and I need you and I want you. The truth? Wasn't my style. Now you tell me. (lively music) (Pantera panting) (Pantera groaning) (Travis moaning) Oh. Oh, oh. (belt buckle clanking) I'll show you. I'd love to see it. Travis, look. (people chattering) How you doing? Thanks for coming. Pantera. Take a look. You know this is only round one. Well, Miguel Ortiz avenged his brother's death. What more could he want? Power. Hitting federal agents was just his way of alerting the pros. It was all Salazar's plan. Now, the next step is to kill the civilians involved in his brother's case. So Ortiz ordered the hit on Salazar? I'm sure he did. Salazar was lethal but he did have a sense of honor. He never would have allowed Ortiz to go this far. What have you got? This is what Washington came up with. It's a real show-and-tell. You seem to be staring at me. You're the only failure Salazar has ever had. Oh? He prided himself in keeping his cool in the crimes he orchestrated. But he made it a point to get personally involved in your murder. Well, we go back a long way. Yeah, kill him to find out that he botched it up. Too bad he's already dead, huh? (chuckles) I like to think about him spinning in his grave. (men laughing) We've been made. Let's get outta here. All right, let's go outside. Pantera, you stay put. LG, you and I are gonna take care of this. (tense music) Okay, we hooked 'em, they're coming. Wait a second, you stay here and make sure they don't see you. You're leaving me behind? That's right, now go. (Pantera grunting) Ready? (moving to tense music) (boat motor rumbling) There they are. There's a boat down there, get your gun. (tense music) Get your family and get your butt out I'm taking your boat! Move, move! Move! - Gimme the rope. - Move. - Gimme the rope. Push us off. (suspenseful music) Come on Albrotto, let's get 'em. (dynamic music) There they are, shoot! (gun firing) Get 'em! (guns firing) [LG] That was a bad shot. [Shooter] Get closer! Move faster Albrotto, come on, faster! (guns firing) [LG] Get him, Travis. Try him now. Travis, boy you gonna get us killed. Concentrate, I'll keep it steady. (guns firing) He's going to the net, get him! (guns firing) [Shooter] Move closer, get closer, come on. (gun firing) (guns firing) [LG] That's it, keep it steady. (gun firing) You get him? (guns firing) (shooter screaming) [LG] You got him! [Travis] No, I didn't. Pantera shot him from the barge. [LG] There's still one left. (tense music) Come on, LG, you take over. This old pro will show you how to take the steering wheel out of his hands. (guns firing) (man grunting) Yeah, yeah! Son-of-a-bitch is shooting a little high. (men laughing) (somber music) [Woman] I guess you know you took my boat. Well, this boat's for rent isn't it? Yeah. Well then? There you go. Uh, good day. [Pantera] You shot at him 20 times and missed. Where did you learn to shoot like that? Darlin' it's a gift. (all laughing) I'm off to Washington to free things up for us. Okay, I'll assemble the best crew I can find. I'll have a meeting in Vegas tomorrow. Proceed. Okay. Man, where did you learn to shoot like that? Well, wasn't that one of my lessons? Yeah, I guess it was. (phone ringing) Jade, have you heard from Donna and Taryn? Yeah, they're safe. I talked to them on their plane. They're on Molokai now. Here's what I want you to do. Get Donna, Edy, and Taryn, catch a first flight to Vegas. We got some business to take care of. Consider us there. You ready to boogie? You got it. (car rumbling) (dramatic music) (people chattering) Who's she? Oh, she was sent to assist us. What do you say we get the meeting started, huh? - Uh, yeah. - I agree. Yeah, ready. Cover me will ya? You got it. (slide projector clicking) Alejandro Philippe Salazar code name the Picasso Trigger. Assassinated on the front steps of a museum in Paris shortly after he donated a $3 million painting. I have reason to believe that Miguel Ortiz double-crossed Salazar in order to gain control of an international crime syndicate Salazar ruled. Pantera has tipped us on the second stage of Ortiz's plan. The witnesses against his brother will be assassinated next Monday. Our plan will go into motion exactly at noon Hawaii time on Sunday. If we're not precise, our targets could scatter and we could lose a valuable advantage. (slide projector clicking) This guy's Toshi Lum. He's the network's link to the Far East. (slide projector clicking) He takes care of the smuggling and the money laundering operations. Toshi's living quarters are in the penthouse of his office building. We can set it up. It'll be tough but I can handle 'em. (slide projector clicking) [Travis] These two are Glen and Schiavo. They're henchmen for Charles William Patterson. He's the backbone of a white slavery operation that spans half the globe. Patterson's perversion is his sadistic participation in snuff films. (slide projector clicking) Lali is his most recent victim. I'm sure we can lure Patterson out of hiding. Glen and Schiavo worked for him. They're at the club for every show. I'll hang with the girls and tie up any loose ends. (slide projector clicking) This beautiful guy's Miguel Ortiz, international drug smuggler and avenger of his brother's death. Although it seems that vengeance has taken a backseat to his desire for power. We suspect that he's the one responsible for Salazar's death. (slide projector clicking) The guys you're looking at here are Ortiz's personal bodyguards. (slide projector clicking) He's never without them. And these two gentlemen patrol the outside perimeter of the estate. Donna, I want you and Taryn to handle Miguel Ortiz. Travis, Miguel Ortiz is the most formidable of the group. I thought he would be your assignment. I believe Travis gave out that assignment to the best man for the job and I use that term figuratively, of course. Nothing personal, Donna... Good, let's keep it that way. Donna, can we not let our emotions get the best of us please? Same to you, buddy. Travis, where will you be in all of this? I wanna be with you. We'll station ourselves at Salazar's estate on the north shore of Hawaii. Why, what's the point? He's dead. It was his base of operation. Something may erupt and if it does I wanna be there. (slide projector clicking) Pantera, you leave tonight on the 10 p.m. to Honolulu. You'll also set up the communication network for the rest of us. I'll meet you at Lookout Ridge on Sunday. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's imperative that we arrest them all at once. Together we can break 'em. And one more thing. Expect the worst. (lively music) Would you please, please tell me what's wrong. (sighs) Something about Pantera bothers me. (ice clinking) I just knew her in college. I haven't seen her in years. Were you in love with her? [Travis] Can we just stick to the businesses at hand? The business at hand is a woman who sleeps with a lethal criminal and does it in the name of the United States government. [Travis] Okay fine, so she's no Nancy Drew. You're jealous, you're jealous. I don't have a jealous bone in my body. [Travis] Is that a fact? Check it out. (ice clinking) (Travis clears throat) (Donna chuckling) [Travis] Don't mind if I do. (upbeat gentle music) (dramatic music) (jet screeching) Hey, guys, I'm gonna fly the Molokai Cargo plane back. I'll catch you later. Right. Hey isn't Jimmy-John playing in that pro-am golf tournament on Molokai this weekend? That's right. He's no pro at golf but he sure can use his driver. (all laughing) Woo hoo, see you later. - Okay, take care. - Bye. [Taryn] November niner niner 786 requesting clearance. [Air Traffic Controller] Roger, runway six left. (majestic music) This is it, Whitey. If I sink this little puppy and it's all over. Choke-a-rama, you're known for it, baby doll. Here we go. Damn! I knew it, I knew you'd blow it. Oh ho. No problem, Whitey, no problem. This is what I call a gimme, okay? 90 feet means nothing to me. Might as well throw in the towel now. It's all over. Pullin' the pin. (lighthearted music) No. No. I don't believe it! (sighs) You guys are breaking me. Yeah, and we're loving it. You're bound to win someday, Jimmy-John. Maybe not. Here's a C-note. Take that young lady to dinner. Come on, Willie. Yo, Whitey. Hi, sailor. Want a lift? Taryn, darling, what a surprise. Mmm, tough game? Ah, not too bad. How much did you drop this time? Well (sighs)... Speaking of golf, wanna putter around? Mmm, your cart or mine? (Taryn laughing) (lighthearted music) (jet roaring) Donna, I want you to go to Molokai and keep an eye on Miguel Ortiz. His dossier gives me everything I need to know. He walks the beach morning, noon, and night and has a late dinner at Edy's. Well, since you got that straight, how would you like to become an honorary member of the Mile High Club? Travis. We're seven miles up. Then we'll do it seven times. (laughing) Then we better get started. Good idea.

(table clattering) (dynamic music) (glass shattering) (body thudding) (gentle music) (gun firing) (wall clattering) (Rusty growling) (machine gun firing) Freeze! Don't even blink! (tense music) (Rusty grunting) (gun firing) Didn't I tell you, Jade. I got a black belt in shotgun. Glad about that. Well, it's another bitchin' day in paradise, huh? (chuckles) You bet, dude. (men chuckling) (pager beeping) Abort Monday mission? Hey look, man, there's trouble in Vegas. We better get back to the house. (motorbike rumbling) [Clayton] What the hell is that? It's those broads from the boat. I thought we blew them away. (tense music) (motorbikes rumbling) (dynamic music) Taryn, they've spotted us. Over there. [Taryn] I'm right behind you, Donna. [Donna] Move! (motorbikes revving) (motorbikes rumbling) There they are! [Hondo] Clayton! [Taryn] Look out, he's gonna shoot! [Clayton] I'll nail 'em, Hondo. (guns firing) Hondo! (dynamic music) (motorbikes rumbling) Let's get the other one. (tense music) [Donna] Think we lost him. There he is, look. Right there. How we gonna get him? I got your little surprise from the Professor. (ominous music) (boomerang whirring) (explosion booming) I'm glad those two are out of the way. Miguel should be at the beach. I'm gonna hit the water. All right, I'll hit the house. Good luck. (motorbike rumbling) (gentle music) (motorbike rumbling) Miguel, Miguel, check this out. [Radio Announcer] Len Chin, Peter Schiavo, and an unidentified associate were killed today in Las Vegas apparently the victims of a gangland style rub out. We'll follow this up with a later report. Chin and Schiavo. Let's get back to the house. I don't like this. (waves crashing) Get your weapons. Check the grounds. Our plan must not be compromised. (pager beeping) Damn it. I'm running this show. There's no way we abort the mission. Lance, get me Hondo and Clayton. Spiel, get your gun and get outside. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (car rumbling) (explosion booming) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (Taryn grunting) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (dynamic music) (gun firing) (Taryn screaming) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (Spiel grunting) (Taryn groaning) (suspenseful music) (Miguel shouting) (motorcycle rumbling) (gun firing) (speargun firing) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) (jet roaring) (motorbike rumbling) There's a message to call LG. There's an emergency. I'm going back to the hangar. Are you all right? Good thing I was wearing my vest. (grunting) I caught a little lead. I'll get checked out. I'll be okay. Okay be careful. You, too. (motorbikes rumbling) (lively music) (Travis grunting) [Pantera] What happened to your leg? Oh, nothing, I just sprained it jumping out of bed. Will you be all right? I'm gonna be fine. Look, I'm gonna go inside the house. I want you to stay out here and keep watch, okay? Okay. Now, the entrance is over there on the left-hand side. Good luck, Travis. (tense music) LG, what is it? Donna, I just arrived here in Dallas from Washington and have I got a kicker for you. Lopez drove at least 50 yards before the explosion so that means it wasn't the ignition. It was a remote job. They didn't mistake him for me. They killed the wrong man on purpose. There's a lot more to this than we thought. (dynamic music) (tense music) (moving to ominous music) Mr. Abilene. Nice of you to limp by. You were expecting me. (eerie music) (laser whirring) There's an awful lot of radiation in this room more than from that TV camera. Sorry about LG's death. (suspenseful music) He was a fine individual. He's alive and you know it. Yes, I do. You killed the wrong guy when you exploded the Jeep and you did it on purpose. Had to get LG's attention. So he'd gather up his best agents to do your dirty work. Can you think of a better way to get rid of my enemies? I guess I should be flattered. In major corporations power struggles are resolved by stock options, bonuses. My world's a little different. (ominous music) My most prized possession, the painting of a Picasso triggerfish, creature that rips out the underbellies of his adversaries. (Travis chuckling) I see, a self-portrait. (sighs) Perhaps. I've seen enough of this painting and I've seen enough of you, asshole. (screen whirring) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (glass shattering) (Travis grunting) No! (gun firing) (Pantera panting) (Travis grunting) Travis, are you all right? Yeah, yeah I'm fine. Look I'm sorry. Are you okay? [Pantera] Oh, I'm okay. I didn't know it was you. [Pantera] Don't worry, I'm okay. Good. Gosh, what happened in here? It's a long story. (gentle music) (eerie music) (Pantera gasping) (dramatic music) (Pantera grunting) (sad music) She was one of them. I knew that. You knew that. Yeah, I knew that. Let's get that son-of-a-bitch Salazar, huh? (dynamic music) Over here. (waves rustling) (shack clattering) (boat rumbling) (gun firing) Shit! You missed him! He was moving, all right? (tense music) (dynamic music) You won't make it, Salazar. I got you covered. Hold it right there, Salazar. Don't try anything. Keep those hands up or I'll shoot. [Alejandro] I've seen you shoot. (guns firing) (gun firing) (Donna screaming) [Travis] Donna! (spear gun firing) (explosion booming) (somber music) Nice shootin'. Take no prisoners. Who do you think the man was who got shot in front of the museum in Paris? I don't know, some poor unsuspecting actor looking to make a buck. At least the real Alejandro Philippe Salazar's finally dead. (somber music) Women. (suspenseful music) Easy come, easy go. Well, they're expendable. So are you. (gun firing) (man grunting) (suspenseful music) (moving to dynamic music) Four, three, two, nine. (buttons beeping) (missile firing) (tense music) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) (gentle music) Congratulations, everyone. Washington says hell of a job. But how did you know the real Picasso Trigger was still alive? Well, you see I had a hunch so I set the computer for the coordinates on the pacemaker. The homing device did the rest. You see the Picasso Trigger set us up to kill off his competition. Pantera was a double-crossing bitch. She was working for Salazar the whole time. I knew that. You knew that? Yeah, I knew that. Professor, we couldn't have done it without you. Professor, you have fantastic instruments. You noticed? (all chuckling) And what's gonna happen to the painting? Yeah, Taryn what is gonna happen to the painting? I have it and I think I'll keep it. After all the authentic painting is hanging in the new Contemporary Museum of Paris. This one is only a copy. Or is it? (all laughing) Cheers, ladies and gentlemen. - Yeah, hear hear. - Job well done. Cheers, cheers. (glasses clinking) - Professor. - Cheers.
