Yeah, they was cookin' something. - It smells really bad! - [Robbie] Medicine! - [dog barking] - [Rowena screaming] I have nothing to do with it! - Do you know who this is? - That's our mom! - [Rowena grunting] - [dog barking continues] We've got to call welfare for these kids. - Wait, we're already on welfare! - [dog barking] Look, look, we don't know who these people are. My mother has nothing to do with these people. We just stayed here last night. That's it. Are they gonna put us in jail, Mom? - Wha... No! No! - [indistinct chattering] They're not gonna out us in jail. They're just trying to help. Right? Please! Please, I don't want my kids to see me like this, please! - [dog barking continuously] - You handle this. We don't have anybody here to look after these kids... [Gracie] Please let us go to our grandmother's. - We won't cause any trouble... - [Robbie] No! Get into the car. Get into the car. Get those kids out of here now. Now! - Okay. - [officer 2] Now!

Come on, Spike! - [indistinct shouting] [vehicle approaching] [sighs] Okay, everybody duck. You too, Rose! [Rose sighs] I thought we weren't stopping till we got to Grandma's. We're not... in the mood. [Rose sighs] [sighs] Let's make this good. It's just me and my daughter. I will have the money for you in the morning, I swear to you on a stack of Bibles! - Uh, no credit card? - Credit card? What? I'm, uh... we're, uh... I'm lucky to have the clothes on my back... These aren't even my clothes, they're my neighbor's. Oh, God, I must look like hell... - What... What exactly happened? - [Rowena sighs, coughs] This crapped out guy next door was smoking - and burned the place down. - Can you believe? And... but our grandmother says that she's coming here tomorrow morning, with money and clothes. - We already gave her the... How early is your grandmother gonna be here? - Very early! - The crack of dawn, man! What time do you get up? Why? Because we wanna cook you breakfast, man. Cook me breakfast? - Why would you do that? - 'Cause you deserve it. 'Cause you're a sensitive man. And not many people see that. But who does? - We do. - We do. [water splashing] [Robbie] Oh! I wish I had long hair like you. [Rowena chuckles] My hair used to be longer than this. It used to be down to my butt. - [Ryan and Jonny laughing] - [Robbie and Rowena laughing] When you were young and lived in Wyoming? Yeah, when I was young. Only still are young, Mom. - That's what I like to hear. - [Johnny] Yeah, Mom. - Tell us about Shameer. - [Rowena gasps] Shameer? [sighs] Shameer... was the most beautiful horse in the world. - Arabian. - All white, huh? Oh, honey, he was pale as a ghost. [Jonny] You rode bareback - like an Indian! - Oh, I was wild like an Indian! - [Jonny and Robbie laugh] - I rode him all night long. My hair flying out. Shameer snortin', tossing his head, his hooves were galloping, thudding the prairie grass. - [imitates horse, chuckles] - You forget the wolves! Oh, oh, no. No, no, no. 'Cause the wolves, there was a howlin'... [howls, chuckles] and the wind, it was a blowing. [blows] - But you wasn't scared? - Oh, hell no! We didn't care. It was just him and me in a dead out run. Oh, man, my heels were boring into his belly. I could feel every breath he took. God, I could feel his heartbeat. [inhales] We were galloping forever, never wanting to stop. And we didn't... [chuckles] stop until we got all the way - to Montana. - [all chuckles] And Grandma Lou had a cow, right? She had so many cows, she could have had a cow farm. - [boys imitate mooing] - [Rowena imitates mooing] Shhh! Hey, hey, hey! Shh! Mom, we're gonna wake up the manager. - [Jonny] Moo! - Killjoy. Hey, Mom, when do we get to go to Wyoming? Oh, soon baby... [exhales] - soon. - Shameer still there? No, silly, Shameer is dead like your Grandpa. Uh-uh, Shameer lives in the barn in Wyoming! - We better get everybody to bed. - Oh, okay, okay. One, four, three. - One. - I... - Four. - Love... - Three. - [Jonny] You! - [boys whooping] - [water splashing] Shh! [engine starting] [Gracie] All right. Come on, come on. - Are we blowin' the joint? - [Gracie] Yeah. Kids, kids. Towels, towels. Come on. [indistinct chatter] Ready? Put it in. Okay, ready? On the count of three! - [Rowena] One, two, three. - [Jonny] Two, - three. - [Gracie] Three. Go, go. - [Rowena] Shh! - [indistinct chatter] Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you! - You gotta pay! Hey! Hey! - [tires screeching] - [car horn honking] - Oh, oh. [sighs] [Robbie] Grandma Lou! [boys] Grandma Lou! Grandma Lou! Oh, it looks like we got some company. - Unexpected. [chuckles] - [indistinct chatter] - Um... - [boys] Grandma! Oh, my Lord! [indistinct chatter] - [Robbie and Jonny gasps] - [Jonny] Oh, yeah! Guys, these are for Grandma's guests! - Hey, Momma! - Rowena. I hope you're not stayin', because I got my monthly Bible meeting happening. - [Louella chuckles] Oh. - Put that one back. Now don't touch those. They're for the Bible ladies. - Robbie, put it back. - No, don't put it back. Uh, now go ahead and eat it now that you've got it. No, don't put it back. Nobody wants to touch food dirty little fingers have touched. - [chuckles] - [indistinct chatter] - Uh, ladies, this is my family. - [women chuckling] Ladies, go right on with your meeting. - [clattering] - [indistinct chatter] When's the last time these children had something to eat? [sighs] These kids have been through hell... but I have so learned - my lesson. - [Louella] Oh, Rowena. - Oh, I've heard that before. - [Rowena] Mom... - I mean it. - [Louella] All right... all right. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna help you, God help me. Mom. But you can't stay here. No, no. Yes, I'll help you find a place, but that's it. - [sighs] - [indistinct chatter] [Jonny] Hi, Rose. Hi, Gracie. - Hi. - Hi. - [cats mewing] - [Rose and Gracie giggling] [vehicle approaching] This is the last of my dishes. You have cleaned me out, Rowena. Of course you never take care of anything. - [Rose] Mom! - [Gracie] Mom! Look what we found by the canal! [chuckles] Mine is Shadow, and Rose's is Snowball. Oh, they're, um... well, they're so tiny - and cute. - Well now, that's all you need, is two stray cats. - How do you know... - [Rose] Aw. - That they don't have germs? - [Rose] Oh, can we keep 'em? - Of course, you can keep 'em! - [Louella] Oh! But they look a little hungry. Why don't you go get 'em some milk? And why don't you pick me up some hamburger, and a can of tomatoes and some paprika? Gotta have paprika if you're gonna cook. Are you gonna make Rudy's Hungarian goulash? Well, I don't know, Rose. You want me to? - Yes! - [Rowena] Well then, hell yeah! - I'm gonna make it. - [Gracie and Rose giggling] Who's Rudy? - Mama... - [Gracie and Rose giggling] Rudy was a Hungarian friend of mine. [chuckles] Only now, he's in prison. [cats meow] Which Commandment did he break? Stealing or murder? - [Rowena sighs] - [clatters] What's a Commandment? [Rowena] What's a Commandment? The Ten Commandments - that God gave Moses. - That God gave Moses, Rose. Don't you know anything? [Louella] Rowena, I know you never take these children to church, but it'd be nice if you just got 'em back - into school. - Tomorrow! Damn, do I have to write it in blood? Tomorrow! Well, don't just stand there gawking! Go get the milk! - And the stuff for goulash? - Forget the goulash. Yeah, your mom's gonna be too busy... [clanking] - cleaning up her dishes. - Would you... give 'em some money for frozen pizza? [cat meowing] [Gracie reading slowly] "Rom... Romeo, Romeo, wherefore... - art thou Romeo..." - "Wherefore art thou Romeo?" She's not asking where he is. She wants to know why he's called Romeo. "That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet?" Go on. "Deny thy father and refuse thy name, - or, if thy while..." - Wilt! "Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love and I'll no longer be a Capulet." What's your name again? - Gracie Thompson. - Okay, Thompson. You ever heard of Romeo and Juliet? - I know what a Romeo is. - [students laughing] Uh... o... okay, but, the... the story, the play. Romeo and Juliet.Shakespeare. Star-crossed lovers. West Side Story. [sighs] They're from two different families at war with each other. She's willing to give up everything for him. Impetuous. Passionate! Do you kids have any passion? - [burps] - [students laughing] Thank you, Mr. Bodell. [indistinct chatter] - Are you okay? - Today sucked. [Gracie] So tell me about it. - Rose. - [Robbie] Hi, Gracie. - [Robbie] Hi, Gracie. - [Gracie] Hi, guys. [Ryan] How was your day? - [Jonny] Hey, how are ya? - [Gracie] How are you doing? - [clanking] - [door closes] - [Rowena] Oh, hey, girl. - [indistinct chatter] Hey, honey. What do you think? I think that's my T-shirt and it's too small for you. [Jonny] Gracie, look at the new scale Mom got for us. Mom, I know what this is. The police are gonna be back! You think my boobs are too small for it? [sighs] Oh, come on. You're not upset, are you? - Honey, I paid for it, didn't I? - Whatever. Oh, come on, don't go anywhere. I want you to meet somebody. Ray, I want you to come out and meet my little sister, - Gracie. - Mom! What? [chuckles] He knows I'm kidding. Anyway, people do think we look like sisters, all the time. You didn't tell me Gracie was so cute. - Ah, yeah, she is, isn't she? - How you doing? You are so cute. [chuckles] Oh, God, Gracie. She's always been jealous of me. - She should be. - [Rowena] Yeah. [door opens] - [Ray] Gracie, you awake? - [sighs] I am now. What do you want? I'm sorry. Can I talk to you outside for a second? [cat meows] What? Well, come on. I'm not gonna bite. Where's my mom? [chuckles] She passed out in the bedroom. Come over here. I just wanna talk. You kids have had a hard time. I can see that. Your mom... [sighs] she drinks too much. I just... I just wanna be your friend. - I'm gonna be living here now... - [scoffs] Good luck. You're a smart girl. I could tell that right off. The whole bunch depends on you. I'm sorry. I scare you? Hey, little girl, I know. I know how hard it is for you. There's no one... No one to help you. Love you. There's no one to touch you. Hey. Oh, yeah. [speaking indistinctly] - [Gracie grunts] - [glass shatters] - You bitch! - [screams] - You like that? Huh? - [groans, pants] - [Gracie grunts] - You like it. - [Gracie grunting, whimpering] - [Ray chuckles] [Gracie whimpering] - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Cal... - What is going on? - She's coming onto me! - You liar! - What? - Stop it! Go to your room! - You liar! - Go! - Look at my face! Look at my face, Mom! That's what you get with your smart mouth! I can't believe you're defending him. - [Rowena] I am so sorry. - He is a complete sleazebag! I can't believe you're defending him! - [indistinct arguing] - Can't believe... please! - He even broke my jaw, Mom. - Don't mess this up. [both panting] He's the one. [shudders] The one what? Gracie, I'm young. I like him. Really, I like this one a lot. - [exhales] - [Rowena] Please. [door opens] - [beeps] - [indistinct chatter] What happened to you? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute. Who hit you? - I walked into a door. - Yeah, right. Now, are you gonna tell me what happened, or do I have to take you down to the office? What difference does it make? I've been hit since I was born. Where do you come from? - All over. - Where all over? All over! Campgrounds, trailer parks, motels. We even lived in a car. I've been to so many schools, I lost count after 41. [indistinct chatter] Do you ever tell anybody about this? No. [chuckles] I'm gonna have to report this. Why? - [Rowena chuckling] - [Ray chuckling] [Rowena speaking indistinctly] [Ray groans] - [cat meows] - [Ray chuckles] [Rowena] Oh, hey. Hi, girls. Well, where are the boys? Look what we got, donuts. - I got donuts. Who wants some? - I do. - I'm starving. Can I have two? - [Rowena chuckles] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Uh-oh. We're gonna get fat. - [Rose] No. - Mom, you're way skinny. - I am? - [Rose] Mm-hmm. - Am I too skinny? - No. - Let me see. Turn around. Oh, it's cute. [chuckles] Gracie, come on. I got jelly for you. You've been gone for three days! We had nothing but cereal. No money, no milk. I don't... [chuckles] I don't deserve a life? I can't have a little fun? You kids on my tail all the time. [sighs, scoffs] [humming] [grunts] Mm, mm, mm, mm. Thanks. [cat meows] [cat meows continues] Ow! Shadow, you meanie! You bit my finger. [Rose] Do you think Mom will really let us keep 'em? It won't be like Spike, huh? Remember that dog that my dad got us? Yeah. Remember how he used to kick it? [police sirens blaring] [indistinct chatter] [Rowena] Kids, kids, kids, kids! Get up! Get up! Get up! - [claps] - Come on. The cops. - [Rose] Mom, what's happening? - [Rowena] Gracie, get the kids. Get the kids! The cops are here! [Rose] You guys... [speaking indistinctly] Gracie, come on! Go, go, go! You got to help me with these kids, man! [Ray] To hell with the kids! I'm outta here. - [toilet flushes] - [Rowena] Gracie! [sirens blaring] [Ray grunting] Oh! Oh, man. Easy, easy, easy. [officer 1] You have the right to remain silent. - [Ray] Easy! - [officer 1] Anything you say... - Come on. - [Robbie] Where're you taking us? [Hines] These children can't stay with parents who have drugs. Oh, my God, kids! Come on, man. He showed up last night! I don't even know him! I swear to God I didn't know he had any drugs! - Gracie! - [Robbie] No! - Are they gonna kill Mom? - [Rowena] Gracie! No, baby. They're not. She'll be back. - Gracie! - It's gonna be all right. - Don't worry, she'll be back. - Do something! Please, Gracie! [sobs] [indistinct chatter] Okay, boys. Ryan, Jonny in the first van. Wait, what do you mean? Uh, you and your sister come with me. - [Jonny] No! No! - No, no, you can't separate us! - [clamoring] - Yes. It's just for a few days. Until this all gets straightened out. - [Jonny] No! No! - [Rose] Gracie, do something! No, you don't understand, he's fragile! - He gets picked on... - [Jonny] No! No! [Hines] Ladies, don't make this worse than it is. - This is all your fault! - [indistinct shouting] [Ryan and Jonny screaming] No! Stop him! - [Robbie screaming] - [indistinct shouting] - [Robbie screaming] - [indistinct shouting] - [Ryan] Gracie! - [Gracie speaking indistinctly] No! [Ryan grunts] What are you doing? Ryan! Ryan! Don't get in the van! - [Ryan] Rose! Rose! - [indistinct shouting] - Rose! - [Gracie] No, no, no! [Rose screams, sobbing] No, Robbie! Don't! Open the door! Open the door! Stop it! Open the door! [speaking indistinctly] [screams] [Gracie and Rose sobbing] - [door closes] - [buzzer buzzes] Get undressed. Put your bags on the counter. I've put all your stuff in paper bags. You get everything back when you check out. This is for your hair, lice. - We don't have lice. - You don't know what you got. Scrub, or I'm gonna do it for you. Hit the showers. Did you see her eyes? Cat-woman! No, but at least this junk smells better than that stuff - Mom used to spray on us. - Yeah. Roach spray. How many kids in this world get to get sprayed with roach poison? Ugh, it probably got into our genes and our kids will be deformed or something. Can you believe Mom's in jail? They're probably spraying her too. That'll show her, huh? Yeah. What goes around comes around. You can say that again. - What goes around comes around. - [Rose chuckles] Rec time is 6:00 a.m., breakfast is at seven. - General clean up at eight. - [Rose sighs] You have to be washed, combed, beds made. You'll get your assignments for chores. Kitchen, laundry, restrooms, showers. Okay. You're in here. Not you. - No, wait a sec. - We wanna be together. - I don't have any empty beds together. Just do it. - It's not a big deal. We can sleep in the same bed. We do it all the time. - I can just sleep on the floor. - Don't give me a hard time. - [Grace] It won be a problem. - [Rose] No, I wanna stay... - No, I just wanna stay with... - Take her. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't take her away! - [indistinct shouting] - Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! No! Rose! Don't hurt her! - [Rose] Gracie! - [Gracie] Rose! [attendant] Move it! Come on. - Come on. - [Gracie] Are you okay? No, it was freezing in that horrible little room. And they kept the lights on all night. Poor baby, so cold in her little padded cell. She's so special, she got the only single in the hall. - [whistle blowing] - [attendant] Get your arms in the air. I don't think I can handle this, Gracie. [Karina] She doesn't think she can handle this, Gracie. - It's all right, Rose. - [attendant] ...three! Bigger! - Come on, girls! - [Rose] What about the boys? I mean, do you think they're going through stuff like this? Poor little Robbie, he can't be. Poor little Robbie? Who's he? - [chuckles] Another sister, probably. - [Gracie sighs] You better toughen up, little baby. You want your diaper changed, stupid? - I'm not stupid! - Hey, Rose, don't. Hey, Rose, I heard your mother's in jail! - I heard she's a hooker! - Yeah, well look who's talking. [Gracie] Hey! Hey! - [indistinct shouting] - [whistle blows] - [Gracie] Don't touch her! - [Rose] Grace, stop it! Stop it! [Gracie] Don't you dare touch her! - [alarm buzzing] - [clamoring] [Gracie grunts] Where are my brothers? I have a right to know! [sobbing] I demand to call my grandmother! - [door slams] - [alarm buzzes] - Oh. - [Rose] Grandma! [Louella chuckles] Oh. Oh, my little Rose. - [chuckles] Grace. Girls. - Why didn't you come for us? Why, honey... I... I... Nobody told me you were here. Nobody ever called me, and every time I called and called, all I got was recordings. Oh, my God, all kinds of just recordings. What about Robbie and Jonny and Ryan... All of you are going to stay with me for a while. We're gonna see how it works out, let us try it for a while. And I think that's good. - Get in the car where it's warm. - Grandma, you're using a cane. Oh, p'shaw. Grandma Lou, can we please go get our kittens? Yeah. [sighs] Well, why not? Shadow! [lip smacking] Here kitties! - Shadow? - [Louella] Your mother's still in jail. So, what happens when she gets out? She is not allowed to live with you kids. She can't even see you, and that's the deal. Else, I don't get to keep you. I can't get the money to keep you. Grace, Grandma's got to have some money to feed you kids. I got to have the help. [indistinct chatter] I can't keep cleaning up her... [chuckles] ...messes. And my heart just won't take it. - [inhales, exhales] - [indistinct chatter] I hate my mother for doing this. - No. - [Rose] Snowball! - Shadow! - Rose! - They're not here. - [sobs] I can't find them. - [sobbing] - Come on. We'll get new ones. [Robbie] Gracie! - [gasps] - [Robbie] Gracie! - [clamoring] - Oh, my God! You've grown! - I swear you've grown! - [Ryan] You didn't call us! I had no idea where to phone! There's mean kids calling me a retard, am I? - Oh, of course not, Robbie. - What did you do to your hair? Don't mess it! Does Grandma have any hair gel? Maybe not hair gel, but Jell-O for sure! - [Jonny] Come on. Hi, Grandma. - [Louella smooches] Hi, big boy! Good to see you. Okay, hot in the kitchen. These kids are driving me nuts. Every time I turn around, one of them is there. Yeah, well, Robbie is fine as long as he can see you. This morning I went in the bathroom, and he followed me in there. We just have to keep telling them that we're at Grandma's now, and that we're safe. Yeah, which means more commandments. - Thou shalt go to school. - [Gracie sighs] I hate school. [door creaks] [Robbie whispers] Gracie? [sighs] Okay, okay. - Don't take all the covers. - And don't wet the bed! I won't. [Jonny] Gracie. We don't wanna be alone in there. Just for tonight. [sighs] All right. Just be quiet. Grandma says we gotta say a prayer. - Shh! - [Gracie] Just whisper it. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the lord, my soul to keep. - If I should die before... - If I should die before... [all gasping] You look like a bunch of little animals! I won't bite 'em. Boys do not sleep with girls. Is that one of those commandments? You bet it is. It's God's commandment. And you get out of this bed right now. You go back to your room, and you stay there! Do you hear me? Scoot! [Louella sighs] [door closes] [indistinct chatter] [bell ringing] - [Mrs. Thurston grunts] - [Gracie grunts] - [Gracie] I'm sorry. - Aren't you supposed - to be in class? - Look, lady, - I gotta pick my brother up... - My name is not "Lady." It's Mrs. Thurston. I'm a counselor at this school and you will help me gather up this mess. I'm gonna need to talk to your parents. Good luck. If you find my father, I'd love to meet him. Look, don't give me no attitude. I just want some straight answers. - Now what about your mother? - She's in jail. Well, who's the head of the household? It's supposed to be my grandmother. Who buys the food and prepares the meals? I do. You gotta do something about your schooling. I don't know how you made it to the twelfth grade. I have no idea what they're talking about in class, in math... The problem is your IQ test says something completely different. You're just behind, but you cannot skate through this school - like you did your others. - I don't! It's just some days I have to leave early. And I don't wanna hear about you ditching. It's not ditching! I have to get a job! I have to make money. Gracie, making money is not as important - as going to school. - [sighs] Now, look, I can't help you at home. But I can make sure you do your best here. I am doing the best that I can. And I think you can do a lot better, if you put your mind to it. Can I be excused, or whatever I'm supposed to say? I have to pick up my brother. If you really have to go and pick up your little brother from school, go ahead. But listen, my friend. You better get your act together. [door opens] - [whistle blows] - [indistinct chatter] - [man 1] Come on. - [man 2] Oh, yeah! [coach] All right, Wolverines. - She thinks she's so hot. - Oh, sure. [coach] Ladies, on your marks!

[chuckles] - [Gracie] What are you doing here? - My fault! I thought you deserved a day off. She has had plenty of days off, since she met you. Hey, did you help Grandma with supper? What about the boys? Did they finish their homework? Um, Jonny was working on some stupid model. He was using toilet paper rolls to build columns, or something... He's making a model of Acropolis. Maybe you could have helped him with it. Miss, could I get a burger and a chocolate milkshake? If you can pay for it. Please, please, please, please. Gracie, he forgot his wallet. - [Ricky] Forgot my wallet. - [sighs] Fine, I'll pay for it this time, but don't come in here again without your wallet. Please, Rose, I gotta be able to depend on you. Okay. Thanks Gracie. [Gracie] Could you put this in front? ♪ I belong for the first time ♪ I believe in you and me... ♪ Hey. You are going home? Yeah. I'll give you a ride.

[chuckles] [Tommy] And don't laugh, my mom's a psychiatrist. - Who's laughing? - Everybody. She's always askin' me crazy stuff. I don't really wanna tell my mom. So what about you? You haven't said anything about yourself. You're not giving me a chance. [chuckles] Yeah, I guess I'm a motor mouth when I'm nervous. - I make you nervous? - Hell, yeah! Okay, it's your turn. My mouth is sealed. [sighs] You asked for it. This is my house, and I live here with my three half brothers and half-sister. We're all bastards. We have different last names 'cause we have different fathers. I haven't seen mine since I was two. Our mother's a drug addict, and she's in jail right now. We live here with my grandmother as a ward of the court. All my brothers have ADD. Jonny has ADHD. Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. And Robbie, the youngest, who's a little slower, has trouble being alone. Okay? Is that enough? No. I... I mean, I'm... I'm sorry. Don't be. I'm not. No, I mean, I like you. - [door opens] - I just wanna know you. [Louella] Grace! - Come here. - What's the matter? I told you, I don't have time for this. I run a zoo, I... How about I give you a ride tomorrow? - I told you, I take the bus. - [Tommy] That's okay. So tomorrow, we'll both take the bus. [chuckles] - What? - [door closes] You are knocked up, and I'm the last person - that you tell? - [sighs] I knew what you'd say. Rose, this is so stupid! How are you gonna raise a kid? - See? I knew it! - [Gracie] You can't quit school. Mom quit school, and look what happened to her. I hate school! So what, you're gonna live with Ricky and his roommate, and then what? Clean houses for other people? - [birds chirping] - Rose, stay here. We can raise the baby together. - Oh, lord! - [horn blaring] Another one won't make a difference. Rose? Ricky said to hurry it up. [Rose] Bye, you guys. - Rosie! - [Gracie] Rose, wait! [Louella] You make sure that boy marries you! We've never been separated. [sobs] [Ricky] Hurry it up, babe! I am saying good-bye to my sister, Ricky, so just can it! Look, I know what you're thinking. That I'm gonna end up like mom... [chuckles] but Gracie, I love him. I can't do this without you. It had to happen someday. I'm not like you. Okay? You can do anything. Just take care of yourself, huh? I'll call you. [vehicle receding] - [beeping] - [keypad tapping] Uh, excuse me, ma'am? Could you, uh, help me with my computer? - I'm having some problems. - Go away. [chuckles] So, how's it going? It's right up my alley. [sighs] The Black Plague was caused by bacteria that lived on fleas, that lived on rats. I know about rats. Look, I'm having some problems with my computer. Why don't you come over there and just, you know. - Um, if you don't, um, then... - Stop. [Tommy chuckles] Something's wrong. I don't know... I don't know, what it is. - [indistinct chatters] - What's going on. - [Gracie] Oh, um... - [beeping] - [Gracie] ...you have to clear some space. - [Tommy] Mm-hmm. - [beeps] - [keypad tapping] - Just press escape. - What if I don't wanna escape? [Mrs. Thurston clears throat] Gracie. That report is due tomorrow. I'm almost finished, Mrs. Thurston. Yes, you are. Jeez. [chuckles] She's not that bad. I mean, she's on my case a lot, but it's actually kinda nice. You know, she cares. I care too. Look, why don't you invite me to dinner? Meet Grandma Lou and the kids. It'd be fun. I won't bite. Okay! - [Louella chuckling] - [Gracie] And there it is. - [Tommy] All right. - [Ryan] All right. [Louella] Robbie. We have to bless the food first. - What do we say? - A prayer. "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep. - And if I should die before..." - [all chuckling] I think your grandma means to have God bless the food. - Thank you. - I don't know that one. Yes, you do. Good food, good meat, - good God, let's eat. - [all laughing] [door opens] - [Rowena] One, four, three! - [boys] Mom! - Mom! - [Robbie] Mom! Mom! - My kids! - [clamoring] [Robbie] Where have you been, Mom? Oh! I want all my monkeys! - Did you enjoy your trip kids? - Trip? [Rowena] Where you went since I've been gone. I would hardly call that a trip. Hi, Momma! - These kids been good to you? - Yes, Rowena, they have. Oh, that's good, that's good. Oh, everybody, this is Franco. Franco, the everybody. - [Franco] Hi. - How do you do? And who is this? You sure don't... [chuckles] look like one of mine. - This is my friend, Tommy. - [whispers] Tommy. Well, I'll be, looks like Gracie got lucky, huh? Mom, would you mind if I talk to you - in the hall... hallway? - [Tommy clears throat] Not at all, baby. What you eating? Lettuce? [laughs] Franco, make yourself at home. - Okay. - [Rowena] I'll be back. I'll be back. - Would you care to join us? - [door opens] I didn't know you had a boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. - Well... whatever he is... he sure is hot. - You can't stay here. - [crickets chirping] What gives you the right to tell me what I can and can't do? Because I don't want another trip to a youth facility. - [scoffs] - I don't, and that's exactly what's gonna happen if you and your friend don't get outta here. I just got outta jail, Gracie. You don't wanna give me a welcome home? You don't wanna give your momma a hug? [thunder rumbling] [Rowena] Thank you. [sobs] I missed you. [sobs] We're doing really good right now. Please don't mess this up. [sobbing] [sighs] I am not gonna mess this up. I am not gonna mess this up. - [sighs] - [thunder rumbling] [TV announcer] he's got the big-rig there. - Vanderpool with the turnaround. - Oh! [chuckles] - Oh, hey there Tommy. - Hey. How you doing? Where you two off to? Uh, I'm taking Gracie to meet my folks. Oh, yeah, and we weren't invited? [chuckles] - Well... - Hi. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. You could use a little makeup if you ask your momma. - You look great. - Thanks. - Okay, well, good night. - Oh, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Try doing something I might do. [both laughing] - [chuckles] Bye, Ms. Larsen. - [door closes] - Um, how many people live here? - It's not that big. Yes, it is! Tommy, oh, my God, my entire house could fit in your garage. - Do you think I need makeup? - Look, will you knock it off? Tommy, they're not gonna like me. [sighs] Listen... I like you. They're gonna love you. Come on. Mom? Dad? So, Tommy tells me you have three brothers? - And a sister. - Older? Younger? - Younger. - How much younger? - Um, she was a sophomore. - What is this, the inquisition? I'm just interested, Stan. So, just leave us alone. [Tommy chuckles] Her name is Rose, and she's getting married and expecting a baby. Oh, goodness. [chuckles] I hope that's not giving you two any ideas. Well, Ma, I thought, you wanted a grand baby. [chuckles] I do, but not yet. Um, where's the powder room? Bathroom. Uh, it's, through the door, and to the left. Tommy, show Gracie. - Yeah... - No, it's okay. I got it. [Stan] Gracie... how do you like your burgers? Cooked. [footsteps receding] [sighs] "Powder room"? [scoffs, sniffs] [sighs] I keep telling your son, he has to visit some colleges - and make some decisions. - [Stan] Mm-hmm. What colleges are you looking into? - Ma, you want me to chuck this? - [Deena] Mm-hmm. I hadn't really thought about it. Well, you better. There's lots of competition. Oh, are you... Are you still hungry? If no one's gonna eat them, would you mind if I took 'em home to my brothers. 'Cause my grandma has a microwave... - Of course not! Of course not! - [Deena] Sure! - No, we have some buns. - Sure! - We've got some cookies... - Get some containers. - [Tommy] I'll get some bags. - [Deena] Yeah. Yeah. [clanking] [Louella] They're just little children. [Rowena] What am I supposed to do, Mom? Rowena, I have asked you not to smoke in my house. [scoffs] Uh... [blows] ...okay. [inhales] [Louella] That Franco fellow is upstairs, asleep on my bed. And little Robbie told me that he saw you in there with him - doing exercises... - [grunts] with him and I know what them exercises are. - In front of your own children! - [Rowena] Oh, God. What am I supposed to do? There was no lock on the door. [clanging] Well, I'm sorry though. I mean, that... that... oh, God. I don't want the kids to see me like that either, Mom. I mean, what am I supposed to do? I don't have much. He's all I've got. - [clicks tongue] - Rowena, the children are so upset. They've promised, they promised not to tell anybody that you're here, but they're just little children and Robbie... [sobbing] he doesn't understand. Oh, God, your daddy. This would just about kill him. Oh, God! [groans] Listen Rowena, that check is gonna come tomorrow, and why don't you and your man take the check? And why don't y'all just leave? - [Rowena] Oh! - [Louella] Because you know what? It would really be best for everybody. I bring nothing but misery. - I didn't say that, Rowena. - No, you did. - I mean, you might as well know. - Don't put words in my mouth. [Rowena] Let me get Franco and I'll get out of your hair. No, Rowena, wait. Honey, please come to Momma. - Please, listen to me. Honey. - What? What? If you just... - get back into the church... - Mom... why don't you admit that I should've never been born? Oh, God. [sobbing] Don't say that Rowena. [sobbing] You're my baby. Oh, God. I will not turn you out. [sobbing] My sweet baby. My little baby. Oh, my God, I love you so much. - [sighs] - [patting] - [Rowena] I love you too, Mama. - [Louella] Oh. [mumbling] My baby. [mumbling] - [chuckles] - [Rowena] God, do I love you. [Bob] We know your mother's living at your grandmother's. I just have to ask you one question. Are there any relatives that would take you and your siblings? - Not that l know of. - [indistinct chatter] Well, we're gonna have to find foster homes. - No! You're not separating us! - Be able to take care... We've already been through that! Foster homes. It's not juvenile hall. They're good people. We screen them. They take the kids for the money! I'm not stupid! Look, I'll get my mother out of the house! [sighs] It won't work. Your grandma's always gonna take her back. She says she won't, but she does. I'll take them. I'll take them. I'll get an apartment, away from my grandmother's, and I'll save up my money. That money is for junior college. I can always make more. Gracie, you're 17 years old. You have to be a legal adult to be a foster parent. You'd have to be emancipated. I can do that? Yeah. But even then, a judge would have to go for it and... And that's just too much on your shoulders. It has always been on my shoulders. Look, this is a solution. You can't separate us. I'll be their mother. You... - are not their mother! - [Louella sobbing] Oh! Oh! - [Rowena grunts] - [Louella] Oh! What, you're doing this, so you can get - the caregiver money? - [Louella sobbing] You are doing this to get the caregiver money. This is all a set up. She gets the caregiver money and she gives it to you! Because it belongs to me, you bitch! [Louella] No! No! Don't you touch your daughter - like that! Leave her alone! - [Rowena] Just shut up! - [clamoring] - [thuds] - You are not taking my kids! - Your kids? [Gracie] Why don't you just admit that you had us for the welfare money! Too bad, you had so many miscarriages because there would've been more. [gasps, whimpering, shuddering] - [quivering] You go to hell! - I was born in hell! [all sobbing] They are never... - going to give them to you. - [Rowena sobbing] - [Gracie] Not to you. - [Rowena sobbing continues] Just leave... before I call the cops. [sniffles] - Okay. [sobbing] - Ugh. - [Gracie moans] - [breathing heavily] - [Louella sobbing] - [Rowena panting] [Louella] Oh, my little baby grandchildren. - [Louella muttering] - [door opens] [Louella sobbing] [Louella] Oh! Oh, God. [sobs] - [continue sobbing] - [Gracie panting] [Robbie] We can run away. [Jonny] We don't have any wheels. We can take a bus, and we'll all get jobs and find a place to live. Wyoming! We can't run away, guys. That's how mom deals with her problems, by skipping town. We have to ask the court. You're the one that takes care of us. So why do we have to ask the court? 'Cause judges are smart, and they listen to both sides, and they figure out what's best for us. Right, Gracie? We already know what's best for us. Why don't I read you guys a story? We've read Bambi about a hundred times. Don't knock it. It's the only book we've got! [thunder rumbling] [judge] I don't think you know what you're doing. You understand that these children - must stay in school? - Yes, sir. You're employed part-time. You have a work permit? Yes, sir. Through the school. [judge sighs] This has been a very trying day. I've had half a dozen children had to be placed. Well, your school records have certainly improved. - Mrs. Thurston. - Yes, Your Honor? You're a counselor at Gracie's school? What's your assessment here? Gracie is doing extremely well, and I'm also encouraging her to apply for college. - [judge] Hmm. - Your Honor, all of the children are making an effort. Uh, Ryan and Robbie are in Special Day Classes and Jonny's pulling in A's. Now what happens to these children when Gracie's at work? My grandmother can come to my apartment after school, or I can put them in the Foster Family Day Care. I know it's not perfect, Your Honor, but it's very important to me and to my brothers, that we stay together. Where is the mother? Uh, Rowena Larsen? I talked to her yesterday, Your Honor. She said she would be here. Ah, well, how did these children get here today? Easy. We took the bus. - You don't have a car? - Oh, we're getting one. [sighs] Look, uh, I... I don't understand this money problem with your grandmother. She's getting 520 dollars a month for each child. The thing is, Your Honor... my grandmother gives the money to my mother. We don't ever see it. Gracie buys us our shoes and stuff, sir. I mean, Your Honor. But, the money would have to go directly to you. That's gonna make Grandma really mad. Because, see, my mother will raise hell about it. I mean, heck. Well, you don't have to worry about her. Just worry about these kids. - You got a checking account? - I can get one. How you gonna get an apartment? I already found one. It just has to be approved. [judge] Oh, well, all right. How are you gonna handle it all? You got telephone, electricity? Each of these children gotta have their own bed, - dresser... - Yes, Your Honor, - I have the list. - This is ridiculous. I'm gonna give you a week to get it all in order. - I can do it, Judge Donner. - Well, if you could do all that, maybe we should give you a job around here. Okay. [sighs] This is just temporary, but we're gonna give it a three months trial. But I'm gonna be watching you. I want reports - from the doctor... - [Jonny] Yes! The dentist, and copies of report cards. This is highly unusual, but I'm giving you a chance to keep your family together. And I hope it doesn't come back to haunt me. Thank you, Judge Donner. Thank you. Next case! [lock clicks] [Bob sighs] Tough neighborhood. I don't know. It's better than most places we've lived, and we can stay in the same schools. [Bob] Well, uh... you're gonna have to clean it up. I have plenty of experience scrubbing out bathtubs - and cupboards. - Uh-huh. Now, put some pictures up... family stuff. Make it cozy and warm. I'll be back in a week. Does that mean you approve it? Done. [sighs] So, you took all this on without telling me? I was afraid you'd think I was nuts. No, my parents think you're nuts. I, on the other hand, think you're pretty incredible. I didn't have a choice. Before I know it, I'm picking out beds. - What do you think of this one? - It's way too soft. You know what? We got a twin bed in the garage. Okay, how much money you got? Well... [sighs] I've saved a few thousand, and then, with the Foster Care money, - I think... - [Tommy] Wait a minute. You've been saving your money in a sock? Yeah, underneath the mattress. Why didn't you just put it in the bank? You know, earn some interest. - What's that? - The bank pays you a percentage for the use of your money. - Free money? - Mmm-hmm. That is a great... - [grunts, gasps, chuckles] - great idea! ♪ She did what she had to do ♪ Didn't look back And straight ahead ♪ ♪ With no good-byes And a few regrets ♪ ♪ She's gonna make it through ♪ I'll be free...

[Ryan] Uh, we don't have any pictures. So what pictures do we put in the frames? [Gracie] Um... keep the ones that are in there. Isn't Mr. Bessey supposed to be here? I'm late for my open house. - Don't worry, he will be here. - Now can we go out and play? No! You cannot. I don't want you guys getting all dirty again. Mr. Bessey is never late, - so something must have come up. - [doorbell rings] Okay, that's him. Okay, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Okay, everybody ready? Cleans hands? Elbows? - Okay, good. - This is such bull. We're gonna miss the whole thing. Calm down, Ryan. Hello. I'm Sandy Jacobs. I'm your social worker. Hi, um, do you know what? There might be a mistake. Uh, Bob Bessey, Mr. Bessey, he's actually our social worker. Your file's on my desk now. That's the way it works. [Gracie] Okay. - [sighs] - You're late. - Sorry. Traffic. - Yeah, right. We have a telephone now. You could've called. I'm sorry. They're just a little upset because they have an open house at their school tonight. Yeah, it started an hour ago. Yes, well, this takes precedence over an open house at school. Oh! Hmm, it's very homey. - You have gas, electricity? - Look at our kitten, Lobo. It means wolf, 'cause he bites! - We got our teeth cleaned! - Me too! Yes, I have the reports. Who are these people? Uh, Aunt Beth Ann and Uncle Mike. Oh... and where do they live? - Portland! - They do? [Gracie] Mm. Oh. Hmm! Okay, uh, I noticed in the report that your Grandma Lou checks you regularly. - We have a stable support line. - Very stable. And I notice that Bryan has communication problems. Do you mean Ryan? Oh. [chuckles] Yes, Ryan. Sorry. So many families, so many children. I really don't wanna upset him so I would... I would rather discuss this in private. I just think you should consider counseling for him. That... that's a great idea. I will do that. Okay, well, I have to make my report to the judge. All in all, I would say... good job. I'm gonna grant you a three months extension. Good work, boys. - [door opens] - [all chuckling] - [chuckling continues] - [door closes] [Louella] Grace. - I have got to hand it to you. - [indistinct chatter] You have a lot of patience. And... you're a better mother than I ever was. Grandma, we never could have done all this without you. Who drank all the milk? Guys, if you drink up all the milk, we don't have anything left for the rest of the week! Why couldn't we get cereal? - Because it's too expensive. - [vehicle approaching] Ryan'll eat the whole box. Besides, it's got too much sugar and you guys are hyper enough as it is. - [Robbie] Gracie, who are those guys? - [man 1] Check it out. [Gracie] Mind your own business. Robbie, just get in the car. [car alarm chirping] - Down, Robbie! Get down! - [Robbie screams] - [Robbie] Gracie! - [Gracie screams] - [Gracie] Stay there, Robbie! - [Robbie] Gracie! Gracie! - [Gracie] It's okay! - [Robbie] Gracie! [Gracie sighs] It's okay! [siren blaring] [officer 1] You can't give us any description of the shooters? You didn't notice the make? The color of either vehicle. I was covering up my brother. That was the only thing I was thinking about. - Where exactly were you? - [Ryan] Where were you? Don't talk to my sister like that! She pays taxes! Ryan, show some respect. It appears you were caught in the crossfire - of two rival gangs... - [Ryan] They shot our car! Through the door, the rear-view mirror, the windshield. They blew a tire off! - My sister came home... - Ryan, get a grip! - [sirens wailing] - [Gracie sniffs] Go upstairs, I'll be up in a minute. Now! Please excuse my brother. He thinks he's my husband. Oh, this is all so terrible, just terrible. You and Robbie could've been killed. Grandma! Robbie, honey, go upstairs and get ready for bed. Take Lobo. Jonny's gonna read you one of the stories we bought. [Robbie] Good night, Mr. Policeman. - You are not helping this. - I know, I know. I shouldn't have said that in front of him, but I just couldn't help myself. [sobs] I know, Grandma. - [sighs] This kinda thing... - [door opens] was always happening to your mother. - [door shuts] - [Tommy] Gracie! I came here as soon as I could. You okay? - [Gracie gagging] - What's wrong? I think I'm gonna puke. [gagging] [Tommy] Okay, you guys say your prayers? All right, goodnight fellas. Don't let the bedbugs bite. - [Robbie] Goodnight. - [Ryan] Goodnight, Tommy. [door closes] Hey. Hi. I can't believe you threw up on that cop. [both chuckles] Yeah. It was a real projectile too. It was a freak accident. It could've happened to anybody. Ah, it just brings up so much old stuff. You know, with my mommy. [inhales deeply] Oh, it's like nothing has changed. You're not in that life anymore. - It's time we made plans. - [chuckles] Plans? Tommy, I can't even plan a lunch next week. I'm going to court every time I turn around. I'm going from social worker to social worker, to social worker. I have to do the laundry and the groceries by myself. I have to put shoes - on their feet, I have to... - The kids are getting older. Your grandmother can take over soon. You're not hearing me. Hearing you. Baby, yes, I am. Next year, we're gonna get our own place. I'm gonna go to Braxton, you're gonna go with me... [chuckles] College? Tommy, I can't afford college. On a scholarship. Gracie... you're getting A's and B's. Baby, I love you. We're gonna get through this. Together. [chuckles] Think about you for a change. Forget about it. [inhales] Think about it. [Gracie sniffs] Right now, I'm thinking about something else. [Tommy] So, what do you think now? - [indistinct chatter] - [Gracie] It's very - ivory... [chuckles] ...tower. - [Tommy] You like? I like. For you. Tommy what makes you think they're gonna give me - a scholarship? - This. - I went on the internet. - [chuckles] By yourself? Uh-huh, very funny. Look, Foster Family scholarship application. All you have to do is apply. It's a lock. Yeah, right. Do you know what a college degree means? - More money. - No, more us... you know. Have our own kids, start a family. Instant family, just add Tommy. You want? Yes... - Tommy, I want very much. - Mm. Good! [both chuckle] I've never once seen you take a break. I'm applying for a scholarship. - Oh! - So wish me luck. College? I thought you were saving for a wedding dress. - That'll come, later. - [phone rings] And I'm renting a wedding dress. I'm not gonna buy anything that I'm only gonna wear... [chuckles] ...once. - [phone rings] - Hello. Gracie, it's for you. [indistinct chatter] [man] Careful. [gasps] Grandma. Hi. I'm here. It's gonna be okay. - [monitor beeps] - Rowena? - No, no, Grandma. It's Gracie. - [Louella sighs] You runnin' around without your shoes... [chuckles] like when you ride your horse. - I told you a million times. - No, Grandma, it's Gracie. I've got my shoes on. I knew you'd come Rowena. 'Cause you know how much I love you. You know, I spoiled you. I spoiled you when you were a little girl, but I was too strict. In all the wrong ways. Parents aren't always so smart. But I promise, I'm gonna make it up to you! Oh, you will forgive me Rowena. Please! [sobs] You forgive your mama. Yeah, yeah. I forgive you. Just rest now, okay? [sighs] Just rest 'cause I need you. We all need you. - [Louella sobbing] - Just... [Louella sighs] [Priest] Lord, when we hear the words of your commandments, that you giveth and you taketh away... so often we look only at the part that's half-empty, the taketh away. Yet even as we are filled with sadness for the loss of our beloved Louella, we are also here to celebrate what she gave us. Louella Larsen. Proud mother to a fine and wonderful daughter, Rowena. - Loving grandmother... - Isn't mom supposed to be here? She told Rose she was coming. [minister] ...just plain Lou. Although Lou was anything, but plain. We ask you dear Lord to take her. For the last few weeks, I'm starving. All I want is chocolate all the time. [indistinct chatter] [Rowena] Kids? - Boys? - [door closes] [woman] Okay, thank you, darling. Oh, my God, you guys! We couldn't find the church. [chuckles] Tommy, you're still around, - dude! That's rockin'. - Yeah. Well, look at ya'. My girls, my little girls. My baby girls. - [Rose] Hi, Mom. - Oh! - [Rose chuckles] - Get out! [chuckles] Oh, my golly. Roland... [chuckles] can you believe it? I'm gonna be a grandma. Wow. [chuckles] Poor Grandma Lou, huh? [laughs] You guys listen, I want you to know something, okay? If you want anything... of your grandma's, you know, a little... a little trinket... Or keepsake, or something you let me know, okay? She didn't have much. She only had 7000 dollars, which she gave me, of course. You know, and the house, and... and furniture and stuff. Listen, where are my boys? Um, they're outside. - [Rowena chuckles] - [footsteps receding] - [man] Come on! Come on! - [Robbie and Jonny chuckling] Hey, boys! Guess who's home? Well, what's up? Come on, Jonny, Robbie. Well, come on. [chuckles] - [chuckles] Oh, yeah! - [Robbie] Momma! [grunts] Oh, hi, baby. [chuckles] That's my boy. Come on... Jonny. Let's go man. Ah, come on. - [Jonny] Oh, Mom! - Ryan? Ryan! - [Jonny] Oh! - [Rowena] Come on, man. [Rowena smooches] That's the way - I like to see it. - [boys grunting] - [Rowena screams, chuckles] - [boys chuckling] Do you think she's gonna try to take the boys? [Rowena yells, speaking indistinctly, chuckles] Who knows what she's gonna do? - [Robbie] I got her! - [Rowena chuckles] [Rose] Come on. [Rowena] No! [indistinct chatter] [boy] Come on, guys, let's go. [indistinct chatter] [vehicle approaching] - [door opens] - [bell dings] [waitress] Gracie... that guy over there. He wants to talk to you. Okay, um, will you cover for me? - Thanks. - [indistinct chatter] What can I do for you? Well, what you can do is get your ass over here and give me a hug. Who are you? Gracie, I'm your daddy. What's the matter? You don't believe me? I... I don't know. I... - I can't. - Listen, um... have... have you got a little place where we can go talk for, uh, just... just... just a minute? Come on. Yeah. Yeah. - Look at you. You're a manager. - [indistinct chatter] I mean, that's... That's fabulous. You know, you... you... You look real pretty, like your mom. And, uh, what can I say? You turned out great, Gracie. It's no thanks to you. There's no smoking in here. Come on, don't be mad. You know, I just... [sighs] I couldn't see you because of the restraining order. They... - They'd a put me in jail. - Because you beat me. No, no, no. Your mom beat you. Is that true? Sweetie, I just been... thinking about you all these years and... and waiting until you was 18, so that I could see ya'. You ever heard of a phone call? Jeez... Gracie, you know, I kinda had some problems of my own for a while. - [clanking] - [clattering] But, you know, the thing is, that now your mom is, she's trying to stick me with this, back child support thing. She's claiming that Rosie and... And... and the boys are my kids. Well, you know they're not, right? - So, what I need... - [rustling] I just need you... to sign this thing that says that I was long gone - by the time that... - This is why you came to see me? Well, I mean, she can't get away with it because... - Because they're not my kids! - No, they're mine. [rustling] Good luck with your child support, Daddy. [sighs] You guys, what is this? [chuckles] Well, wake up and smell the roses. - [Robbie] Congratulations! - [Jonny] Congratulations! - Thank you. - You have to stay in bed. Breakfast in bed like on TV! [Gracie chuckles] Oh, my goodness. One, four, three? Come here. - [Ryan] One, four, three Gracie. - [Gracie] This looks delicious. - [principal] Jared Tarleton. - [applauding] - [camera shutter clicks] - Gracie Thompson. - [Ryan] Yeah! All right, Gracie! - [Robbie] Gracie! [clamoring] Your parents must be very proud. Exactly. - [whistling] - [cheering] - [camera shutter clicks] - [indistinct chatter] [boys] Gracie! Gracie! - [Tommy] Hey! - Well, hey, there you are. Hold it, hold it guys. Okay. Cheese! - Beautiful. - I'm so proud of you. - I told you, you could do it. - Thanks. Hey, there's punch - in the auditorium. - [Mrs. Thurston] Gracie, Tommy, there you are. Congratulations. [Gracie] Oh, thank you Mrs. Thurston. [Mrs. Thurston] Oh, I'm so proud of you. Mrs. Thurston, I am sorry, I was such a pain-in-the-ass. I hated your guts. Don't worry about it. I hated yours too. [all laughing] Oh, I got a new job this summer. Doing books for an escrow company. Is this coming from the girl who once told me she couldn't do math? It doesn't take brains. I'm just loading numbers into a computer, that's all. Whatever it is, you're starting a new life. And with the new scholarship, now that is the best news. [sighs] I'm proud of that. I can't believe it. Boys, do you wanna say hello to Mrs. Thurston? Say hello. - [indistinct chatter] - [Jonny] Hi, Mrs. Thurston. So when were you gonna tell me? I don't know. This got all messed up. You found out you got a scholarship... - and you just threw it away? - How am I gonna go to college and leave the boys? A few years and they're gonna be - on their own. - Look, Robbie's seven-years-old! That's a long time, Gracie. Look, I just gotta know. Do you love me or not? Tommy, you know that I do. Then say it, Gracie. But I can't turn my back on the boys. - Even if I wanted to, I can't. - Let somebody adopt 'em! Gracie it's a good opportunity for the... If anybody's gonna adopt them, it's gonna be me. Do you know what you... What you just said? So, you're serious. You're gonna try to adopt them yourself? - Who are you? - I don't know what I'm gonna do. Look, the boys adore you... - and I know that you love them! - I love you, damn it! I wanna be with you! I wanna marry you! I want us to have our own kids. Not with them. - Tommy, don't say that. - You gotta make a choice. Look, I'm sorry, Gracie. I'm only nineteen. I got my whole life ahead of me. I can't. Gracie, your family is ruining your life. [scoffs] You don't even see it. [Paul] You expect me to take this case pro bono? I don't expect anything. I'm just... I'm hoping. How do you know your mother will sign a release? I don't. The only way she'd sign it, is if she was high on pot. They'll assign her a lawyer. You only get one shot in court, you know. You'd have to luck out with an understanding, flexible judge. - We had one before. - And what about the fathers? I don't know who half of them are, - neither does my mother. - [Paul sighs] Or you have to get a hold of relatives. - You have to check out... - Uh-huh. Last known addresses. - Mm-hmm. - You have to put ads - in the newspapers. - Mm-hmm. You've got locate these people so that parental rights - can be terminated. - I... I... [sighs] - Ancillary costs can add up. - I know. I'm prepared. I went through all this stuff with an adoption worker. There's little or no precedent for any of this. - A person as young as you are... - Are you gonna help me or not? [footsteps receding] [Gracie] Robbie! Ryan, don't wrinkle it, I just ironed it. It's an expensive shirt. It belonged to my boss. Robbie, honey, come on. We gotta get going. - We can't be late. - It got a big stain! Well, tuck it in, it won't show. Why can't we ever get anything new? Why don't you start mowin' more lawns? Are you scrubbed good - behind your ears? - I'm ready! My hair okay? What is that smell? I used some of Tommy's cologne. He left in the bathroom. - Well, you used too much. - Is Mom gonna be there? Oh! Come on. All right. I want you to sit over here. You're in charge. Do not talk to anyone, okay? Excuse me, while I go barf my guts out. [flushing] - [water running] - [spits] [water stops running] Would you mind if I had two of those? - Aspirin? - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. [rustling] I come here this morning, thinkin' I was doin' some good, and... and they took my children away from me. What kind of people take babies away from their mothers? I don't. Um, sorry. I mean, um... Hope... I hope it works out for you. - [Ryan grunting] - [Robbie chuckles] [Jonny] It's a great idea. Gracie's gonna love it. - [Rowena laughs] - [Robbie] Hi, Gracie. - Look who's here, Gracie. - [Rowena smooches] Well, hi there, Gracie. Hey, what do you think? They said I should look respectable. She looks pretty. Doesn't she, Gracie? Oh, I don't know. I do feel a little like my mother. Maybe I should add a little more lipstick? - You're beautiful, Mom. - You look... you look fine. Mom wants to take us to Wyoming. [Rowena] Well... we could all go. Gracie, you too. You're invited. - We could start over. - We can take Lobo. She's gonna sell Grandma Lou's house, - and buy one in Wyoming. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're gonna have a ranch house with, uh, cottonwood trees, and a pond and a pasture. [Jonny] We're gonna have a huge garden. [Rowena] Right, because, uh, we'll grow all of our own food, right? Oh, and she says we're gonna have horses. - Arabian horses like Shameer. - Yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I know I wasn't a good mother... but like I told the boys, I loved you. I love all of my children. I'm gonna make up for it now. Please, don't do this. [Rowena] Uh, I'll raise them like I was raised. I... my parents were good Christians. I had a good upbringing. It's... it's just that I got a little... [chuckles]...off track, that's all. But I'm in a parenting class now. You've only attended once. [Rowena] Well, that's because I only found out about it in the end. But, um, I'm gonna go to the next session. I swear. [chuckles] J... J... Judge Marks, this is all a mistake. I want my kids. I wanna give 'em a good life. - I've always wanted that I... - Are you prepared to get a job? You're not gonna raise these children on welfare. Well, I'm uh, taking it one step at a time. Thank you. Thank you. Will any of the fathers of the children be present here today? - Oh, God, no, no, no, no. - No, Your Honor. No, they owe me way too much child support. I never had a penny. Never had any help at all. But, I will tell you that these kids were conceived in love. I understand, Ms. Larsen. But according to the petition signed by your eldest daughter... Oh, yes, I read that. Uh, Gracie is a good kid. But that's all she is... Is a kid. If you don't see me fit to be the mother of these children, I want them to go to families - that will help them. - Well, no one has helped them more than I have. Miss Thompson, please. I've gone over dozens of reports from social workers. And all of these social workers will tell you that I've always been the one that's been responsible - for feeding them... - [Rowena scoffs] and clothing them. I get them to school. - It has always been me. - Do you think she's better than me? You should know that she has sex with a boy in the house... - That is not the way it went! - [Rowena] Yes, it is. - He loved me... - Yes, it is the way it happens. - [gavel banging] - and I loved him! Well, counsel on both sides, please try to get a grip on your clients! [lawyer] Ms. Larsen. I'd like to call the children to the courtroom. Let's. [policeman] Boys, judge wants to see you. - Come on. - Come on, Robbie. [Judge Linda] Ryan Walker... Jonny Blicker... and Robbie Locascio. You've been sworn in, and I've explained to you what that means. Now, I'm going to ask each of you a very hard question. [Jonny shudders] Ryan, you're the eldest, so I'm going to ask you first. Who do you want to live with? One, four, three. I love you, Mom. I will always love you. I'm sorry. But I would rather live with Gracie. [chuckles surprisingly] [chuckles] What? [mumbles] Well, he's been brain-washed. - Jonny? - [Rowena] Wait, wait, wait. Jonny, what about you? - [Rowena] Jonny? - Your Honor... Jon, Jon, Jon, Jon! - Look at me. - [Judge Linda] Ms. Larsen. - Look at your mother. - Ms. Larsen! [chuckles] Clearly she's... she's... She's, uh, poisoned them, or brainwashed th... Brainwashed them... - [Judge Linda] Ms. Larsen. - To be scared of me. - Counsel, I warned you. - [Rowena speaking indistinctly] - I told them that I am back! - [lawyer speaking indistinctly] I'm not bad. I'm not bad. [sobbing] I'm just looking for another chance. One more chance, please... [sobs] ...to be their mother. Boys, come to me. [sobbing] Jonny. Come to me, my baby. Boys. Boys. I know this is going to be very difficult, - but try to ignore... - [Rowena sniffles] what your mother has just said to you. Just try and stay with your feelings. Jonny... who do you want to live with? Your Honor... we've been with Gracie all our lives. She feeds us, and reads to us... and helps us with our lessons. [sobbing] She fixes us up when we are hurt... and when we're scared. That's what a mother does, right? She changed our diapers when we were babies! - Mom, you know that's true! - [sobbing] [Judge Linda] Robbie? Robbie? What do you say about this? Robbie? Pay attention. Who do you want to live with? I like to live in Wyoming and ride a horse. - Yeah. [chuckles] - Wyoming? Yeah, that would be fun. Yeah, yeah. But I would like to sleep in my own bed, and go home with Gracie. - [chuckles] - [sobbing] [lawyer] I can take care... [Judge Linda clears throat] I've been with this case for some time now. It seems the children have finally found some stability. I don't want to disrupt that. Ms. Larsen... I know you'll feel pain and remorse. But it's all coming too late. Parental rights are terminated. [sighs, sobs] [sobs] Wha... Is that... Is that it? I can't see my babies anymore? You're not my babies anymore? [screams] Oh, God! I love you, my boys. I love you. [sniffles] I will always find you. No matter where you go, I will find you. [sobbing] [door closes] [Judge Linda] Ms. Thompson, I hope you know what you're doing today. This is a huge thing you're taking on. There's no turning back. These will be your children now. I understand. They've always been my children. They've never been anyone else's. Now can we blow this joint? [Robbie sniffs] He means, are we done? Almost. - Diesel. Like Vin Diesel. - That's stupid. - Potter, like Harry. - Guys, we gotta get serious. The judge only gave us five minutes to come up - with a last name. - Lobo? That's the cat's name. Savage... - Jonny Savage! - No. How about, "Weth-er-ly?" 'Cause we've been through bad weather. Wetherly. Jonny Wetherly. - [Robbie] Me! - Okay. - All right. Wetherly. - Yeah! Wetherly, Your Honor. [mouths] Wetherly. Ladies and gentlemen of the courtroom. For the record, I'm happy to present - the Wetherly family. - [Jonny] Yes! - [Robbie] Yes. - [Jonny chuckles] Gracie Wetherly, Ryan Wetherly, - Jonny Wetherly... - [Jonny] Yes. And Robbie Wetherly. This is a miracle. It's a first. I wanna see you guys when you graduate. It's heroic what you're doing. I wondered when I was reading the case... if I'd make a mistake by granting this. But I know in my heart, I've made the right decision. [chuckles] I just hope you can handle it. I will. I can do it. It's gonna be hard. You've got your own little family now. [chuckling] [Judge Linda] You can make it happen. - We are proud to present... - Yo! The Wetherlies! Whoo! [music playing]
