The British had been ruling us for over 150 years. Years of slavery had given birth in each of our hearts, the desire for a free India. Whether by the shield of non-violence or by the spear of violence... ... achieving freedom became our only goal. It was under these circumstances that a big revolution was born. In a small town, in the eastern province of undivided Bengal- Chittagong. Our Chittagong! This happened in... 1930. It's a military plane. Come on! Let's continue! Ananda... this way! Himangshu... pass it there! Rajat... straight ahead! Jhunku... yes. Over here! Deba... - Naresh... very good! - I am here Fakir. Dodge him... Tegra. It touched Himangshu's hand! - What do they want? - Halt! What has happened? This is a good ground. Set the camp here. Tell all the locals to evacuate. - You cannot play here. - Why? Because we told you so. Go home and play! It's not a game of marbles, it's football. A playground is a must! - What did you say? - What is the matter, Sir? We are setting up a camp here. A camp? Alright we’ll play over there. No, not there either. This ground is off limits. But this ground belongs to us, we have always been playing here! One thwack on your backside and you'll forget all about your ground. Now get out of here! Bring out all the equipment this way. - Should I go talk to them one last time? - No, we will have to leave. But why? Why go elsewhere? This is my ground and I will play right here! So what are you going to do? Fight them? Yes. Come to your senses Jhunku, we can't fight them. Troops, spread out! The ground opposite Kali Mata temple, why not play there? That one's taken over too. But why should we go anywhere else? We should play here. - Come with me! - If we make too much of a protest... ... they'll mistake us for freedom fighters and take us in. So I am a freedom fighter. Let's fight them! Looks like he is possessed by the spirit from the Neem tree! I got an idea! Why not approach a freedom fighter? - A freedom fighter? - You mean, a real freedom fighter? - Stop it, this is all idle talk. - No, he is right... There is one... what's his name... He has even been to jail once! He is also a teacher in some school. - Surjyada? Surjya Sen... ? - Yes. Maybe. Whoever he is, as long as he gets our ground back. Yes! Use your brains. They are fighting for the freedom of the country. How will they have time for this anthill of a ground? Why? Our ground isn't in London. It also is a part of this country! - When will this guy grow up? - No, he is right. Do you know him? I don't, but my elder brother does. - So... ask your brother. - No way. If I ask him, he will slap my cheeks red. You can't even take a few slaps for our ground? You kids still here? Get out of here! Move on! if not I will puncture your football. What will be the solution if we replace x with x2 in this equation? Haripada, tell us! Masterda, x2 or x3, we shall have to mug it up either way. It's too difficult! Applying the correct method solves even the most difficult problems. Let's talk about something else. How many of you have close friends? Haripada, who is your best friend? Masterda, Bidhu! Bidhu, what can you do for Bidhu? I can do anything, Masterda! Would you give your life for him? It is difficult. But it is possible. In fact, it has happened! Has anyone heard of ''Khudiram Bose''? Bidhu? Khudiram Bose has been one of the youngest revolutionaries of our country. Very good! Sit down. From a very young age, he felt the burning desire for the country's freedom. He threw a bomb at the carriage of an English officer. For which he was arrested. And at the young age of 18, he was hung. Do you know for whom he did this? For you... ... for all of us, for his countrymen! - Who is that, Masterda? - Nirmal Sen. Is he a close friend of yours? Would you give your life for him? Anytime. Nirmal! How are you? I got released two days ago and took the first train out and here I am. You must have faced hardships in prison? They would beat me with leather sticks laced with brine. They hit me till they got tired... ... all that escaped my lips was 'Vande Mataram'. We are all very proud of you. - What about Anant, Ambika, Lokenath? - All are here. - We are meeting on Wednesday at 5pm. - Then tell me, when and where do we start! Very soon. Alright, shall I take your leave? - Where are you going? - To meet Pritilata. Listen! At least make yourself presentable! Pritilata... Your eyes are downcast pray why? There's sure someone in your heart, don't hide it. O companion! Why must I be the first one to say it, O companion, let's have it from you. who inhabits is in your dream stealthily? Come on, I'm not the one for your feigning acts. You've started hiding it from me what is in your heart. How did you come to know this? It's your own eyes which betrayed it all to me. He will be here soon! Concentrate... ... or else you will lose. He'll come. O yes, he'll come. Strains of 'Shehnayi' will sound in the courtyard. He's come. He'll have me, O he'll have me He whose love I’ve found. I've come to know who your lover is Now I have recognised your beloved, O companion don't breath a word of this to anyone. There he is! Even if my own kith asks you, be quiet! He's here! He's here! Look behind. There he is! Pritilata! Nirmal! How are you? I'm fine. What about you? She'll be better now. She's been waiting for you since 2 hours. Your train was supposed to reach much earlier. Yes... well, I went to meet Surjya. What is it? - You tell him. - No, you tell him. What's the matter? Kalpana and I want to meet Surjyada. - Why is that? - We have decided to join your group. Is that so? But our organization has no work for women... I can't convince him, maybe you can! Come on Kuhu, let's play! Both of us in the revolution? Kuhu, concentrate. Kalpana! Surjyada's house should be around here. - Let's go right. - No... we should go straight. What's going on here? Clear the road! Move! Do you think that was Surjyada? Let's find out. - Surjyada! - Anant! - How are you? - Fine. - How have you been? - You tell me. I am restless from inaction. Ambikada, hope life is good! Great. What about you Anant Singh? I'm fine too. All else can wait. First, I have to apologize for a mistake. What mistake? I'd just been to my village in Punjab. To sell some ancestral property. I had some money left over and I... ... with that money I bought an English Car for myself. Well you are forgiven. Because we shall use your British car against the British! I feel better now! Ambikada, looks like you have started planning already? Planning and finances are essential for every revolution. How much have you collected? 11 rupees, my salary, which I have deposited here. Are you Surjyada? Who are you all? Jhunku. And these are my friends. What do you want? Do you know of Thekedari Para? - We live there and we have this ground there. - I mean, it's not ours, but it is ours! We play football there every day. Now the British soldiers have taken it away from us! Football? Ground? Why don't you get it back for us? If you are busy today, then do it tomorrow. Get out of here! Let me not see you here again. But listen! Who was it? Some kids. They were going on about some football ground. - Anant! - Nirmal! You guys are still here? I told you to leave! We aren't going anywhere until we meet Surjyada! - I said... - Wait... I am Surjya Sen. Tell me, what happened? - Surjyada we... - Surjyada we were... Quiet! Calm down, one at a time. You go ahead. Surjyada, we live in Thekedari Para and we have a ground over there... ... which the British soldiers have taken. Now what are we supposed to do? We heard that you are fighting them for our freedom. So free the country and give us back our playground. It really is ours, I swear! What kind of people park trucks and put up tents in a football ground? Complete nonsense. We hate the English too! Get them out of the ground! I don't hate the English. I hate the way they function. I hate their intentions and their attitude. Now tell me your names. One at a time! I am Ananda Gupta, this is my younger brother Deba Gupta. I am Rajat Sen. I'm Jibon Ghoshal, they call me 'butter' at home. And they eat it too! I am Subodh Roy! That's his childhood name, he is called Jhunku now. - I am Fakir Sen! - And I am Naresh, Naresh Rai! - I am Himangshu Sen! - And this here is Tegra! Greetings! I sympathize with your plight. I am not making any promises but we shall see what we can do. Alright? You may leave. Thank you! Tegra! Pass it here. Ananda, over here! Rajat! Jibon! We are trying to establish factories here in Chittagong. - Ah Taitt! - Good Afternoon! Meet Barun Kumar Ghoshal... ... the biggest businessman in Chittagong. Captain Taitt, Farell, take a seat. We were in the midst of closing a business deal with Mr. Ghoshal. Certainly... please excuse us. No. Not at all. It's alright. Join us. So, that's 60 percent to us and 40 to you? Well, I would prefer the other way around. 40 - 60? That's the best I can do. After all, it's our people, our resources. Do you realise that we are giving you business... ... in a sleepy town like Chittagong? Mr. Wilkinson, I must share this one with you. Your forefathers lost their way trying to find... ... Chittagong and reached Calcutta instead. Otherwise, your Governor would have been sitting here! So gentlemen... ... do not under- estimate the trade potential of Chittagong. 40 - 60... ok! Mr. Ghoshal, to Chittagong the new Calcutta! So Captain, this is your first visit to India? Yes! It is. And may I know your directive? To establish a stronger military presence here... ... by setting up more camps! Be rest assured Captain Taitt... ... we Bengali teach our children... ... the power of words and not of the sword. - Greetings Ganeshda! - Greetings. Ganesh! What's this? Only Indian cloth! Why didn't you get imported silk? Did you forget? No father, I did not forget. Then what happened? Father... I've been thinking... ... we should not sell foreign cloth anymore. - What do you mean? - I mean that we should only sell Indian goods. Don't start again... imported silk gets us at least four times the profit! Perhaps yes but all of Bengal is boycotting foreign goods. So! You are going to lecture me on revolution now? Think of bringing about a revolution in business! That is what we really need. Father, I am with the Swadeshi Movement. Goodbye mother. - Where to now? - Congress Office, I'll be late. When will you let go of this 'self-rule' madness? When will you stop selling foreign cloth? - Ananda, I'm sure Surjyada will help us! - Do you think we will get the ground back? What do you think? Listen! Hold on! What's he upto? Don't go there, Jhunku. What's he doing? - Stop! What are you doing? - Wait. Put it back. I said put it back! Jhunku! Get out of here! The death of Jatin Das is another reprehensive act by the British Government. We must follow the path shown by Gandhiji. And give them a fitting reply using non-violence and non-cooperation. We must! We want complete independence! Vande Mataram! (Long live our motherland) Time to begin our meeting. What is the difference between our goal and that of the Congress? None whatsoever. We are walking on different paths to achieve the same goal. Gandhiji requested all revolutionaries across the country... ... to refrain from violence for a year. We respected his wish. But what happened? The British injustice only increased! And today, that one year is over! And now, the dream of a free India... ... shall begin right here, in Chittagong! In Chittagong? Surjyada, what's your plan? What are the centers of British power here? Cantonment! - Armoury. - Telegraph Office. Police Lines? We shall attack all these places on the same day! And that is how we will begin our revolution. What do you mean Surjyada? A simultaneous attack on all these places? Is it possible? Yes! Only if we plan it right. This will require a lot of resources. Where will so much money come from? It will come. We shall get it! From the British Government. We shall use their weapons and make them the target! Surjya, if we pull this off, it will create a storm. Yes. The utmost important thing is... ... that we need people who are willing to fight for freedom with absolute commitment. Surjyada! Hold on, I'm coming! You are back again! Didn't we tell you that we shall do what we can. We came to tell you that we don't want our ground back. - That is wonderful news, now leave. - No! We won't leave! Ground or no ground. We have decided that we will kick these 'Whites' out! - That's why we are here. - What's wrong, Tegra? - A white officer hit Jhunku for no reason! - They hit Tegra and Deba as well! If we sit around and do nothing, this will happen again! We have to do something! - So what do you want to do? - We will help you and do whatever you ask. Yes! Very well! You can help us... ... but lives can be lost in the revolution. Are you ready for that? Yes Surjyada. - But you have to make a promise. - Promise? What is it? You can't breathe a word of this to anyone... ... not even your parents. Yes Surjyada. We won't tell our parents. Alright then. Tegra will tell you when and where you have to come. Let's go. Surjyada, why did you make this promise to these kids? They are children, but their aspirations are not juvenile. But aren't they a bit too young? Yes, they are young, but not naive. Didn't you see how fearlessly they put their point across... ... and even committed themselves to action. Besides, many of our comrades are in prison, we need new freedom fighters. But how can we trust these teenagers? Our entire mission can be jeopardized by the smallest error. That is why it is essential we learn more about these boys. Tarakeshwar, gathering other fearless teenagers like these is upto you and Lalmohan. - It'll be done, Surjyada! - Nirmalda... Surjyada, there's someone here to see you. - Greetings Surjyada. - Greetings Pritilata, how are you? I am well. This is my friend, Kalpana Datta. - Greetings Surjyada. - Greetings. How can I help you? Surjya, Pritilata and Kalpana are working for the Women's Congress since the past year. But now... Now we want to be a part of the revolution! I appreciate your sentiments, but you are already a part of the Women's Congress. Then why do you want to join our revolution? Because we agree with your ideology. The path of revolution is hazardous and not safe for women. We concede that we do not possess the physical capacity of our revolutionary brothers... ... but don't we have the right to fight and die for the freedom of our country? Is this the only reason we can't contribute to the struggle for Independence? Isn't this wrong? The revolution is meant to fight injustice. Barring us in this way, is this also not injustice? Surjyada, we really want to help you in this revolution. Alright, let me give you a task. Tell us! What must we do? British Cantonment - is where the British keep all their arms and ammunition. You have to get the ground plan of the place. And if you succeed, you both shall be a part of the Indian Republican Army. Alright! - Ma'am, should I get the car? - No, I will take the bicycle. - Have you informed Dulali? - Yes... I did! Who are you? - I am Bhulu and this is... - Rani! We are Dulali's nieces. Who is Dulali? Don't you know Aunt Dulali! She does the cleaning around here. She isn't well today... has the dry cough. Alright... you can go in. - Wait! Have you ever been in there before? - No. I'll depute a soldier... Manik! This way. This is the Cantonment's Piccadilly Circus, you may start your work from here. Not here! 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9 Wait, dear! Now can we be a part of the Indian Republican Army? An important part. You can go in. Wait! One at a time! - Name? - Jibon Ghoshal. - Father's name? - Barun Kumar Ghoshal. - Are you Mr. Ghoshal's son? - Yes. - Does he know you're here? - No, I can inform him tomorrow. Do one thing. Inform your mother the day after. And the next day, inform your neighbors' as well. Keep informing people till our plan becomes public knowledge! Anant! I will not inform anyone. - How old are you? - Fourteen! Alright, you may leave. - Name? - Rajat Sen. Why do you want to take part in the revolution? They hit my friend, now I want to kick them out of here! Aren't you afraid of getting hurt? What do you have in you that can be helpful for us? I don't know, but I will do exactly as you say. Why do you want to take part in the revolution? We want our football ground back. Alright. - Hey... one at a time. - This is my younger brother. - What are your names? - Ananda Gupta, Deba Gupta. - What is your father's name? - Jogendra Mohan Gupta. Why do you want be a part of the revolution? Why are you taking part? We are taking part, for the country's freedom. We want the freedom to play. - Tegra! - So you are following your brother's footsteps. - Yes sir. - Good. You may go. Wait! Surjyada, question him! He is your brother Lokenath, so it isn't necessary. I'll question him. Why do you want be a part of the revolution? Brother, you have always said that this is our country... ... and if we don't fight for it, then who else will? - Are you prepared to die? - No. - You are not prepared to die? - How will I experience freedom, if I'm dead? Good. Greetings! Masterda! What are you doing here? - Father's name? - He is no more. - And your mother? - She too is no more. My friends are everything to me. - Name? - Subodh Rai. - And your father's name? - Ratul Kumar Rai. - What does he do? - Nothing... he is a landlord. - How old are you? - Sixteen... -Thirteen. Alright. You may leave. Shanti Datta, fourteen. - Seventeen. - Eighteen. - Seventeen. - Sixteen. - Sixteen. - Fourteen. - Twenty. Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Where are you off to? Jibon's place, to study. - Oh yes, how are your studies going? - Very well, father. Fine. Don't be too long. - Too long what? Studying? - No! Don't take too long to get home. Here it is. The boys have arrived. - Why have we come here? - They want to test our strength. - Strength? - Push yourself! - Ambikada. - Jibon. - That's enough. - Can I try? Tegra, well done! Do two more! You have to do at least five! Push yourself to do it! - Isn’t it too light? - Yes. It's enough. Ganeshda, since it's the first day, I... Yes, it is the first day... One! - Pull! One more! - Come on, Deba! Van-de Ma-taram! Van-de Ma-taram! Hey, what does Vande Mataram mean? - I don't know, do you? - Vande Mataram, no... Vande Mataram means- Mother I hail thee. - Mother? - Our motherland! Doesn't it feel good, when you say it- I hail thee, my motherland! Deba, get up! We are late! Jhunku! Wake up! So, did you score your goal! Now get up, breakfast is ready. Hurry up, Jibon! Or else you will be late for school. - Mother, I am not feeling too well. - Why, what's wrong? I don't know. But I have a severe headache. Never mind. Don't go to school today. - Have your breakfast. - Come on eat. Master Jibon, Master Jhunku is asking when are you going over to study. Today you are all a part of the Indian Republican Army. Our plan is to end the British rule at least in Chittagong. And serve as an example for the rest of the country. To achieve this, we must capture 5 places. We shall attack all the centers of British power... ... Armoury, Cantonment, Police Lines, Telegraph Office... ... and capture them on 18th April! And our dream of a free India will begin right here in Chittagong! So are you ready to fight for your country's freedom? Yes! Vande Mataram! This is my Motherland! She asks me where is the morn? Whether the breath lasts or not, the heart now exclaims... I shall capture and bring light! Light that would light up life! I’d snuff out all darkness The darkness is ancient. We've to make a new sun, vibrant! Surjya, think it over one last time. Do you really want to take these teenagers and Kalpana & Pritilata in the revolution? Absolutely, Ambikada. They want to participate in the revolution as much as we do. And we need them too. Also, during our espionage, no one will suspect us, if they are with us. Let's go! There will be five teams. NangaIkote Railway Line... Lokenath... Lalmohan... Tarakeshwar...Upendra Telegraph Office - Ambikada... Ananda... Deba... Biren British Cantonment - Nirmal... Tegra... Himangshu... Shanti Police Lines - Ganesh... Jhunku... Bidhu... Haripada European Club - Anant... Rajat... Fakir... Naresh and Tripura Kalpana, you will help prepare for NangaIkote Railway Line... ... and Pritilata will go to the British Cantonment. We have to keep an eye on all these places. Remember, it is important to make your memory as sharp as a wounded elephant’s. Take a mental picture of everything you see. Because it is risky to carry cameras to such places. - Will you be able to remember all this? - Yes! Long Live... the Revolution! Long Live the Revolution! Police Lines Armoury, we shall take the muskets from here. There are two guards at the gate 2 on the tower and about 3-4 inside. Telegraph Office - there is just one soldier on guard here. - Telegram to? - Calcutta. Along with the Telegraph service, connections to every phone in Chittagong are here. It is essential that we disable this place. Our most important target - British Cantonment! We shall obtain the 303 rifles from here. All the teams shall gather here after the attack. And we shall hoist our flag right here! There are 3 watchtowers with 2 guards each... ... and 3 more guards at the main gate. European Club - there are just 2-3 guards keeping watch and no soldiers, We have to keep all the Europeans imprisoned here during the attack. Come on. The Nangalkote Railway Line connects Chittagong to Calcutta, We must construct a barrier on the tracks to stop the movement of trains. We must find out what time does the last train pass through here! Nine fifty. That's the time, we begin our attack. Now that the dream's dreamt, it has to be realised. The pictures are drawn, they must be colored. My heart's saying dreams and reality are going to merge. The darkness is ancient. We've to make a new sun, vibrant! This is my Motherland! She asks me where is the morning? Ambikada, we need 4 cars and 25 bicycles. There are 54 teenagers. How much money will we need? 18000 rupees. Listen up, everyone! Come here. Every revolution needs money power as much as it needs man power. We need at least 18 thousand. Surjyada has donated his school salary and all his savings. Everyone should try their best. Contribute as much as you can. - Understood? - Paise or rupees? Rupees! 18 thousand rupees!! Take it from the cupboard. Ambikada, 20 rupees! 10 rupees! Why? Mother, do you trust us? Rajat! - That's a lot! How much is it? - A hundred! 100 rupees! The ten rupees are from you. The rest is from me! I am glad you came to me. It's the least I can do for the revolution! This is called a musket gun. And this is a musket ball. You put it in here... ... and push it down with the ramrod. And then, aim and fire! Jibon, show us! Hold this. No one is going to help you during the attack. Do it yourself! Aim. Put the ramrod back in its place. What were you doing! You were stealing! What happened? He was stealing! - Stealing? - Yes, stealing! Fakir tried to contribute to the revolution. But his father caught him stealing and thrashed him! Fakir, why did you steal? Everyone is helping out in some way, I was being of no use and so... But you are being useful! I am? How? You agreeing to be a part of the revolution is in itself a great contribution. You being here is an inspiration for all of us. Promise me, you will never steal again. I promise. - Ambikada. - Yes. We do not have any money to contribute. - But we do have one thing. - What? Will our bicycles do? Yes, will do. Here's two rupees from me. Alright! Harida, we would like to buy second hand bicycles. Get some old bicycles from the back store. 500 rupees, from my brother and me. This is the new British gun - the 303 rifle! It's advantage is... unlike the musket gun, it need not be cleaned after every shot. It can be loaded very quickly. This is it's bullet. This is how you load it. Pull this lever toward yourself and put the bullet in the chamber. And then, lock it. Now the gun is ready to fire. Mother, can I have some money? Money? Why do you need money, son? Don't you have everything? Jibon... Jibon! What's wrong? Yes, Jibon. Ambikada, I couldn’t get any money. You are Mr. Ghoshal's son, right? I've heard you have 4 cars. I am going to Mr. Bhattacharjee's house. Take care of the customers. And put a smile on that face of yours. Otherwise there will be no customers! Very good, Himangshu! And remember! No matter how much anyone hurries you... ... always think before you act! - Anantda, come out please! - Why, what has happened? Just step out first! What is outside? - A car? - Yes. What did you say at home? I purposely took out a part, so that the car had to go to the garage. Now it's repaired and I've brought it here. I'll take it back once our task is done! Mechanic uncle, you can go. Want to drive? Whose car is it? Mr. Ghoshal! Anant, be careful! Ambikada. - What is this? - My jewelry. I have no use for them anymore. Tegra! This is called a Revolver! Unlike the musket gun, you don't have to reload after every shot. It can fire six bullets in one go! - Six bullets! - Yes. - Will we all get one? - No. We have 3 now. We will get 4 more. You will get that long one... musket! So far we have one musket, one 303 and we will have 7 revolvers. We will acquire more weapons from the armoury on the night of the attack. All the raw material Kalpana asked for is in here. I got it with great difficulty. Tarakeshwarda, are we going to make the bombs here? No, not here. We are attempting for the first time. We will have to try it in the jungle. Besides, we will need Kalpanadi. - Have you filled all gunpowder? - Yes Kalpanadi. - Mix them in the right proportions. - Yes. Kalpana! Tarakeshwar! It looks like they put in too much gunpowder. Ambikada.... how much money have we collected so far? 15 thousand rupees. Everyone has contributed something. And now with Kalpana and Pritilata's help we should have all the money in time. Kalpana gave a lot of jewellery and Pritilata gave her bangles. Eamon De Valera has said that... We of Ireland and you of India must each of us endeavour... ... both as separate peoples and in combination... ... to rid ourselves from the vampire that is fattening on our blood. This means that.. Beautiful dreams, they are bound to blossom. Alas! How could I show them to you? Life's saying, whatever is binding Let me first clear it from the path. Perhaps the time to bare the heart isn't yet come. But soon as there's an awakening from the slumber, mind will burst into song. Pushpakuntala Devi. Where are you lost? Just thinking, when will we breathe fresh air? When will we get our freedom? And when will I once again, be chained? You won't ask for your freedom again, I hope! Excellent! Scores of unsaid things, nights squandered on thinking these things. Who are you to me? Am I someone special to you too? Tell me, how can one pass these days? Deeper than the ocean, these silences. You are silent there and I'm lost out here. Perhaps the time to bare the heart isn't yet come. But as there's an awakening from the slumber, mind will burst into song. Eat well. Slowly. Madam! - What happened? - Come here Ma'am! Hurry! Look, what I found! What do you think you're doing! Have you lost your mind? She is hell bent on ruining our family name! Father, how will fighting for our freedom ruin our family’s name? Quiet! Not another word! You are being misled! You are leaving for Calcutta by the first train tomorrow. Father, I'm not being misled. This is every Indians' struggle. I will go to Calcutta and study and make a better life for myself, is that all? If every Indian is this selfish, what will happen to our freedom? Kalpana! Don't argue. Try and understand what your father is telling you. What do you think you shall achieve on this path of violence? Freedom, mother. You are going to Calcutta. You will have to go. And that's final! Enough is enough! You will go to Calcutta for your studies, along with Kalpana. You should go to Calcutta as per your fathers' wish. You will establish contact with other revolutionaries there and... ... send back materials for making bombs. I cannot be away from you. I cannot live without you. Kalpana... ... I understand your feelings. But you need to know something very important. Before becoming a part of this revolution... ... I was married. I know. Her name was Pushpakuntala. And she passed away two years ago. - How? - Because of me. I told her my feelings about the freedom movement... my true destiny. I told her... that the path I had chosen... ... would never let me commit to a home and family. I even told her... ... to forget me, to move on and settle down with someone else. But she was not able to detach herself from me... ... and neither could I from the revolution. And then 2 years ago... ... because of me... ... because of my ideals. I have committed this mistake once. I don't want it to happen again. I have understood. Long live the revolution! You must remember the plan, the way we remember our math tables! Ambikada... At exactly 9:50pm, my group and I shall disable the Telegraph Office. So that Chittagong is cut off not just within the city, but from the entire country. Exactly five minutes later... Ganesh and I will lead our group to Police Lines and take over. Nirmal... Lokenath and my group will imprison the guards at British Cantonment... ... and then take all the weapons from the AFI Armoury. Anant... With my team, I will attack the European Club. And capture the 'Whites' at gunpoint. This will allow us to complete our mission without interference from them. Lalmohan... At exactly 9:50 we shall put up a barrier on the railway track near NangaIkote Railway Station... ... so that no train carrying soldiers, or any train... ... will be able to enter or leave Chittagong. Ganeshda... With the weapons from Police Lines, Surjyada and I will lead our team... ... to the British Cantonment, and capture the Armoury. Lokenath. And then, we shall attack the Jail, and free our revolutionary brothers. After that, we'll attack the Imperial Bank! And the next morning, Chittagong will wake up to a new dawn! We shall have the weapons... ... and Chittagong will be free. Yes! Now, just 5 days remain for the attack! What are you doing here? Get off the ground! Out!! ''Let no one stop us now, no one hinder us We're all set to march forward.'' The stage's set for action now We're swearing allegiance to this cause Whether we get a reward or punishment We aren't in the least bothered. We know what has to be done What we have thought in our hearts will happen ''We'll play with our lives and fight... with all our might!'' 16...17. - What are you looking at? - At your physique. Go on, do your exercises. Move along! This is Chloroform. If put on a cloth and place it on someone's nose, it will make them unconscious. I shall use chloroform to disable the guards at the gate. And then lock the barracks, trapping the soldiers inside. In the meanwhile, I shall fool the guard at the AFI armoury into thinking that... ... I am an Englishman and have him open the Armoury door. And all this, without firing a shot. We should fire only if our lives are in danger. So far, only three bombs could be made. Tarakeshwarda, you sure these will not explode in our hands? Tegra, if his ear was functioning, he would have blasted this bomb on your head. Come again? Tegra is saying that the oppressors' days are numbered. We want to bring justice to our land. We want to stamp out injustice at all costs We're girdled with self-respect We've brought the dream of freedom. Whether a whirlwind breaks out or storm rages No matter which powerful foe charges We've risked our lives. We'll play with our lives and fight... with all our might! Is everything ready? I hope we haven't missed out anything. I hope everything plays out According to our plan, tomorrow. - Where are you going? When will you return? - In the evening. At least have something to eat, Himangshu! Don't worry, mother. Come on! Let's go! The train has arrived! Get off the track. Let's go! - We have to send an urgent Telegram! - The office is shut. It's urgent, sir. Please do us a favor! Don't you understand once you are told? Don't move! Nobody move! - Where is everyone? - Who? All the 'whites'. They have all gone home. They left early since today is Good Friday. Good... Friday! Haripada, Bidhu... go! Sir, what's the way to Thekedari Para? We have lost our way! Where are you coming from this late? From Howrah! Go straight down this way and take a left at the crossing. After that, keep going straight ahead. - Straight? - Yes, straight. - Left. - Are you slow in the head? Go straight down this way, take a left at the turn... ... and then keep going straight ahead. Open the gate! Hurry! What's going on at the gate? Take this. Shall we go in? You all know what you have to do. Move! Open the gate! Wait here till I get inside. - How are you? - I'm fine... who are you? Nirmal. - Who do you want to meet? - His name... his name? Just a minute. His name... found it! Let's go. Open the Armoury door! Sir... Who are you? Step out! Who are you people? It was a gun shot! Check... Halt! Who goes there? Who are you? - How many bullets do we have? - A few, not enough. Tegra... it's time! Tegra, go that way. Nirmal, this way. I'll try and distract them from the front. - Tegra, be careful. - Yes brother. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm an officer... Stop, don't shoot! Tegra run! Vande... Mataram! They might have served the enemy but after all they were Indians. Forgive us brothers! - There is a bad news. - What? - There was no one at the European Club. - What do you mean 'no one'? Today is Good Friday. So the people went to church and then straight home. That's disastrous! That means all the officers will be at home! Surjyada, there is fire at the Cantonment! Kalikinkar, Tripura, Pulin, stay here. Everyone else will come to the Cantonment. Sir! Terrible news sir! The Police Lines Armoury has been attacked by the revolutionaries! What! Operator... the line has been cut! Go inform Mr. Wilkinson, and ask him to come to the cantonment. - Yes Sir... - Farmer and I will also rush there. Hurry! Take as many rifles as you can carry. Now the bullets. - Uniforms! - This one is full of belts. Where are the bullets? - They should have been here. - Nirmalda, Lokenathda! Some car is coming! Looks like the British Officers are here! Everyone take cover! Watch out! Come, run! Keep low! Head to the gate! My god! They have taken over the Cantonment! This is a major attack sir! There are 50 soldiers in the barracks here. I'm sure they have been locked in. But.. the Telegraph Office has been smashed. And we must get the message to Calcutta. You stay here, I will get to the ship somehow. Alright Sir! I hear a car! Behind the wall, quickly! Everything alright here? Yes, everyone took the weapons and left for the Cantonment. The others are following on bicycles, you come with them as well. Alright? Alright. Come on! Let's go! More cars coming in. That's Anantda! Nirmal, Lokenath... what's the news? The soldiers have been locked in the barracks and all the guards are dead. - Finally, we did capture the Armoury! - Yes, but I have bad news. What's that? - We only found the guns. - But not the ammunition. - What? - All we have now are the guns. Which are useless now! Surjyada, these bloody whites have hidden the bullets! Listen up, we don't have much time. Distribute all the muskets we brought with us, amongst the rest. And burn the 303's, in fact burn down the entire armoury! The Telegraph Office has been disabled. Is everything alright here? No. Let me explain. - Get up! - What happened? Get up! The door is locked! Company! Fall in Line! Long Live... the motherland! There they are! Long Live... the revolution! Everyone, to the parade ground! Himangshu! Lie down Himangshu! Lie down! Ganesh! - Ananda! - Let's go Jibon! To the car! Be careful! - Saving his life is a priority. - Yes. Jibon, Ananda... keep firing. Jibon's car! Don't worry Himangshu, Anant will be here any minute with the doctor. Ananda, wait here for Anant. - Himangshu! What happened? - I'll tell you. What happened to him? How did this happen? Who did this? - Don't worry; the doctor is on his way. - But all this... how... when...? - Let me explain - Who did this to my child? You are Jibon, aren't you? - Yes. - What's going on? What are you doing with a gun? What are you boys upto? Uncle, all of us attacked the cantonment with Surjyada. And Himangshu was badly burnt. - Is Rajat also with you? - Yes. Rajat and the others are at the Cantonment. You raided the Chittagong Armoury? Doctor, please hurry up, do something. - Surjya, Staying here is dangerous. - We should get out of here! Anant and Ganesh are not with us either. The main gate of the cantonment is unguarded. Let's go out that way and move towards the jungle. Company! Retreat! Shanti! - Shanti, what happened? - A bullet grazed me! - Where is everyone? - Don’t know... they all left. Alright. Let's get out of here. Revolutionaries attacked the Cantonment and Police Lines Armoury last night! Amazing what Surjya Sen has achieved! They call themselves the 'Indian Republican Army'. Did anyone read their pamphlet? Yes... of course! Surjya Sen had 60-65 revolutionaries with him. All from Chittagong! Many of them were just teenagers! Teenagers! Your son didn't return last night, did he? What's happening here? Chittagong Armoury Raid. The insurgents did not know that the guns and ammunition aren't kept together. What! They don't keep guns and ammunition together! Well sir, we witnessed about 60 of them leaving the cantonment and currently... Yes... we are pretty sure that the revolutionaries... ... have moved into the jungle tracts, Sir. They have taken about 60 muskets from the Police Lines... ... and a large number of musket balls. But not sufficient for a full scale revolt. Sir, We have employed our entire troops in the search but... We need reinforcements, Sir! Get troops from Calcutta, right away! Do you know who you want to get? Yes Sir! Lt. Col. Dallas of the Eastern Frontier Rifles. - Asanulla! - Yes sir? You will work under him. Kalpana! Where were you? - Just around the corner. - Come for lunch? - Go ahead, I'll join you later. - Alright. Quick, shut it! - Listen to today's news! - What? Revolutionaries movement at Chittagong. Serious armed rising at Chittagong There was intense firing between the British soldiers and the revolutionaries before they escaped. But everyone escaped, that's good news! God knows where they are. We have to go to Chittagong. Immediately. I miss home. By now my father must have found out. Not just him. All of Chittagong must know now. I am a gonner! Naresh... Go get Masterda! Masterda! Come fast! - What should we do? - We shall use the bushes for cover. We have enough muskets to take on their 303's. Let's go. These are Jalalabad hills Sir. We have information they are up there sir. - Company... fall in line! - Make four rows! We will take them by surprise and shoot them through the trees. - Company fall in! - Company fall in line! Take your firing positions! Aim at the hills! Fire! Company! Fall back! Reload! - Reload... - Wait. Bring out the Lewis! Reload quickly. Fire! Reload! Prabhash! Tegra! Am I going to die? No! My head feels heavy. I am losing my sight. Where are you? I am right here. Next to you. Tell mother that... Bidhu, Haripada! Tegra's gone! Aim! Tegra gone? Fire! Bidhu... - Lala! - Madhusudhan! Reload! Bidhu. Tripura! Pulin! Retreat...!! Lokenath... Lokenath... They must be reloading! Hurry! Come on! This way! - Come on! - Stay low! Move. Naresh! Come on. Cease fire! Company! Move in. Ambikada! Surjya, get everyone out of here. Get the boys out of here. - Meanwhile, I'll try and stop them here. - We can't leave you here. Don't say a word, just take everyone and leave. Alright, let's go. Vande Mataram! Teenagers! It was an elaborate plan, Sir. Bring them here, search them and burn them. It's not safe for us to stay together. We will be caught easily. At dawn, we will split up into smaller teams and leave, one group at a time. Surjyada made sure many of us got home. Sometimes I wonder... ... if we had found the bullets for the 303 rifles, Chittagong's history would be very different today. The battle of Jalalabad would never have taken place... ... and so many of our friends would have not died. We were still proud of our attempt. Because our uprising shook the British Headquarters in London. They realised that their rule was almost at an end. But we also realised that they would not rest until... ... each and every one of our comrades was caught. Soldiers! Sir... these are the ones we suspect. They were going to Calcutta. What has happened, sir? Why did you take us off the train? Take them inside. Move! Sir wants to know your names. Come on, tell him! I am Jayanto, this is Molai, he is Bholai. That’s Shambu and he is Gopal. - Where do you live? - Faujdarhat. - Why are you going to Calcutta? - We are cloth traders. Sir, they do business in clothes. Cloth merchants... where are your bags? Please let us go, Sir. We are in deep trouble. We don't know anyone. Please believe us, Sir! A big businessman conned us and took our entire luggage. Our entire luggage! Have pity on the poor, Sir. Let a poor man be. Please allow us to go, Sir! You are lying! You are surrounded. You can't escape. Jibon, over here. Ananda! Shanti! - We can't stay here for long. - Alright. There is only one way. - Where is Shanti? - There he is! Shanti! Ganesh, I shall try and hold them here. Move ahead with these two, I shall follow with Shanti. - Go! - Let's go! 9 bullets. Shanti move! Get out of there, Forgive me Shanti. In a pitched battle on Jalalabad hills Lt.Colonel Dallas Smith... ... squashed Surjya Sen's teenage army. The revolutionaries' muskets were no match for the Lewis gun. Another group of revolutionaries was intercepted at Feni station... ... but they managed to escape losing one man. The Government conducted raids and searches across the city including the Congress office... ... and seized pamphlets of the lndian Republican Army. End of news bulletin. There's checking going on. Take the leafIets, I'll take the acid. We should split up. There are two lines. You take the left, I'll go right. You wait. What is in here? - Just some papers. - Open it! Do and die... long live the revolution. - Is this just paper? - I didn't know what was written on them. You know now, don't you? You are under arrest! For possessing papers that incite the public against the British Government. Soldiers! Arrest her! Come here. Please! Don't get up. You need to rest, son. Don't worry, due to your wound you had fallen unconscious. We have bandaged it, you will feel better. - What is your name, son? - My name is Ambika. I am a revolutionary. You and your comrades had seized Chittagong? Yes. But we were not completely successful. Someone had to start this war. What is the use of the blood that is not shed in fighting for justice? Stay here till your wounds heal. Think of us as family. I am Amjad and she is Sultana. We are letting you go this time because of Mr. Datta Gupta. But next time... There won't be a next time. Alright, you may go. This Durgabari Ashram is actually my home. Surjya and other revolutionaries have been coming here for the past two years. Surjyada is like a brother to me. My husband was a landlord. He was killed in the revolt of 'Lal Bangla''. I have two children. Snehalata and Apu. - Pritilata! - Greetings Masterda! - How are you? - I am okay. How is Kalpana? She has managed to get bail. But she is under constant surveillance, so she cannot leave her house. She is awaiting for your orders. You must be hungry? I'll serve lunch. Apu... Masterda, the news from Jalalabad was heart- breaking. This time we will attack the Pahartali club. It is time to take the revolution ahead. Many of our comrades have been captured or are being watched. That is why you must lead this attack. I promise Masterda, I will return successful. I do not have the words to describe how happy I am to see you safe. Why? What could happen to me? I am fine. When I am with you, the desire to live increases. Now, I am even afraid of death. I finished my studies. Pritilata, soldiers! Apu, remain seated. Sit... eat... What? What do you want? We have reason to believe there are more people in here. Move aside! Nirmal! Surjya, both of you... leave! No. We will leave together. Let's go! I won't be able to make it. Go. Leave! Get up Nirmal! Surjya, your safety is very important. The revolution must be kept alive. Go! - Pritilata, let's go! - I will stay here. I won't go! Let's go Pritilata! No... Surjya, take her away! Vande Mataram! Sir, it seems like the revolutionaries have split themselves up into smaller groups. They were probably moving towards Calcutta. We have already sent a communique there and Assam. The commissioner of Police Tegart has taken charge. In Chittagong, raid every house... ... put the town on curfew and double up your men. We will get them sir, dead or alive! My home! Who are you both? - Tell us! - Where are your comrades? - We won't tell. - We won't say anything. It's all my fault. Himangshu, Shanti... please forgive me. Don't shoot... get them alive! Mother, Father, Ananda... good bye. Tegra, Bidhu, Naresh, Tripura, Prabhash, were killed at the battle of Jalalabad. And I heard yesterday that... ... Rajat and Deba and two others committed suicide. Deba... Deba... ... I'll tell him, I'll go tell Ananda! Jibon! Ananda... Deba is dead... ... he isn't coming back! Deba died? I want to go home... ... I want to meet my parents. I don't want to stay here, I'm going home... ... to be with my mother and father. Jibon! Wait. Let me go... let me go home Ganeshda! I don't want to stay here, I am leaving. Mother, father, I am coming. Who are you? Police. Ananda, get up! Soldiers have arrived! Lock the door from the inside. Only the three of them? No sir, there was one more. Sir... this way Sir! Sir Charles Tegart led the forces of the Crown... ... in a spectacular operation in the French colony of Chandernagore. They captured revolutionary leaders, Ganesh Ghosh and Lokenath Bal. Young Jibon Ghoshal was shot dead while trying to escape. Revolutionary Ambika Chakraborti was also found and arrested. Arrest him! Wahe Guru, I am here. Revolutionary Anant Singh, under mysterious circumstances... ... walked into a Calcutta Police Station and confessed. Wahe Guru (Lord), I have come to you. Forgive me. I have come to you. Forgive me. Who are you? Anant Singh, Wahe guru. What are you guilty of? I have a committed a huge crime. I am responsible for Shanti's death. Forgive me. Help me redeem. Wait! What kind of Indians are you? Today we shall avenge those, who gave up their life for the revolution. Let us pass! Let's go! We'll be caught if we stay together. You leave from here, we'll go this way. Move! Let's go. Nirmal, I have completed our mission. I cannot live without you. I am coming to you. 'Vande Mataram.' Kick it! That way! Killed him! Killed him! So many of us... are no more. They fought to regain the dignity of our country... ... and we are going to do the same, Kalpana. Soldiers! Masterda, soldiers. They are closing in. They are closer now. Ready! Bloody hell... fire! Take cover... I have no more bullets. Only five left. Move in. Take him alive. They want me alive. We can't escape together. Listen to me very carefully. I will rush out the front door and lead them to the right and then try to lose them. At the opportune moment, take the others and escape from the left. Got that? Ambika Chakraborti, Anant Singh, Ganesh Ghosh, Lokenath Bal... ... are declared guilty under section 121 and we sentence them accordingly... ... to transportation for life. Tarakeshwar Dastidar is charged with the murder of Sgt. Elliot... ... and hence is sentenced to hang by the neck till he is dead. Fakir Sen, Subodh Roy, Ananda Gupta, Haripada Bhattacharjee... ... are declared guilty under Section 121. We sentence them accordingly to transportation for life. - Fakir, don't cry. We are proud of you! - Jhunku, we are proud of you. Kalpana Datta's guilt is not comparable with that of Surjya Sen. Kalpana Datta is declared guilty under Section 121. We sentence her accordingly to transportation for life. Vande Mataram! Do you have anything to say, Mr. Surjya Sen? My actions have already spoken for me. So, you admit your crime? Crime...? If fighting for one's freedom is a crime, then yes, I have committed a crime! But what about the crimes you have committed against us, for years? What you call a crime, in our language, we call it revolution! You took advantage of your status as a teacher... ... and manipulated and corrupted the innocent impressionable minds of children. What you need to know is... ... that even the children of this country no longer want you here. You even went to the extent of roping in young women... ... like Kalpana and Pritilata as pawns of your own vested interests. The women have picked up the sword in the past to fight your ancestors. So you are guilty as charged of triggering a revolution! You are guilty as charged! You and your government are responsible... ... for the deaths of the martyrs, who gave up their lives for freedom. Neither have I given birth to the revolution, nor can I end it... .. because this has become a tradition! One that shall continue till you leave from here. Vande Mataram! Hurry up! Assist him! Forgive us, Masterda!
