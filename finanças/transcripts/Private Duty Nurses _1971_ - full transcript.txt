[MUSIC PLAYING] Well, how are ya? More gifts from Dewey. Let's go see the apartment. -Thank you. Let's go, ladies. Come on, hurry up. You'll notice this is very fine wood, here. Very nice steps, and all stuck on an old building. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so clumsy every time. Always just, uh-- let's go through this, here. I want you all to know that, uh, there are absolutely no spots in this room. Now, isn't it nice? Why don't you look around, and, uh, make yourselves at home? Uh, you know, there was a-- there was a woman that used to live. And she absolutely swore-- I mean, she absolutely swore that she could see the ocean from here. Of course, we'll not argue with a lady. You can walk to the bars from here. We'll take it. Wait a minute. There's only, uh, two bedrooms. How much? Well, you see, this is a-- this is a really magic place. I mean, I-- I don't know if you've ever even been in a magic place. Yeah, right. How much? Well, just double that in the summer. Well, we do medical field work in the summer, so we won't be here. Well, it's the best I've seen yet, Spring. -I think it's beautiful. -Yeah? Yeah, well, listen, uh, don't make any hasty decisions, now. Just, uh, talk amongst yourselves, and let me know later, OK? Tell you what we'll do-- you all meet me tonight at, uh, Shlumfeller's. We'll, uh-- blow on that and make it spin. We'll meet tonight at, uh, Shlumfeller's, and then you can tell me what you want to do with it, OK? [CAR HORN] I, uh, think I hear the call of the wild. But I'll, uh-- I'll see you guys tonight, OK? I just want you to remember, now, this is a magic place. Right? Magic. WOMAN: Patient Arnell, please return to your room. Dr. Sutton is an extremely busy man, but he's taking this time to welcome you. Oh, one word of caution, though. If at any time he asks you any question-- Ask if the rule about doctors dating student nurses can be repealed. That's one rule that's never bothered you before. This way. Through here. There's the chief administrator of this hospital. Allow me to extend an official welcome to you. You're part of a pilot innovative nursing program here, and your participation here is beyond the scope of the usual nursing curriculum. And I'm a fundamentalist when it comes to hospital administration. I'm quite satisfied with such established procedures as nurses wearing dresses. I have total confidence in Nurse Brandt when she tells me that your training will begin in earnest tomorrow. May I suggest that you get a good night's rest? We like to see our nurses bright eyed and, uh-- are there any questions? Dr. Sutton, I-- Dr. Sutton, I-- I'd like a few moments of your time. I have nothing further to say to you, doctor. -Dammit, I-- -Nothing further! OK, you guys. Lynn and I will flip a coin, and, uh, the winner gets her own bedroom. Well, what about me? Well, if you have your own bedroom, that's segregation. Wait a second, Spring. If she's not included, then you and I are flipping to see who doesn't sleep with her, and that's discrimination. What'd I tell ya? There was no simple solution. Your papers, please? [MUSIC PLAYING] [BUZZER] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. Hi. Listen, I don't want this to sound unreal. And I really mean this, this is not a line, but where your wildest fantasies leave off is where I want to be begin. OK? I'll catch you later. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me. What's this? Compliments of Dewey. Thank you. Thank you. Let's hear a big South Bay welcome for Sky. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) How's that treating your mouth, babe? Well, does it feel real good? How's that treating your mouth, babe? Well, does it feel like you know it should? -Hi, new nurse. -Hi. Remember me? Yeah. Uh, you, uh, want to dance? Excuse me. [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, it's like I was saying. You see, we take this big bus, and we all get in the back, we sing all the old songs-- you know, all out of tune. It's-- it's a terrific time. It's just like-- it's like taking this place, you see, taking Shlumfeller's to Tijuana. Shlumfeller's? Does that mean anything? Yes. It means horny turtle. -Oh, come on. -In Bavarian. It means-- (SINGING) Don't get hung up calling. I'm here where I oughta be. Don't they give me children? You can have a ball with me. How's that treating your mouth, babe? Oh, does it feel real good? How's that treating your mouth, babe? Oh, does it feel like you know it should? Not here, Dewey. Nobody cares now. [APPLAUSE] I was looking at you, it was very fake. I mean, I could-- you probably thought in your head that I-- oh, that was look number 119, but it wasn't. 219, or 119. -Dewey. -No, really. -Dewey. -What? -I wouldn't say that. Oh, wow. Is that a waterbed? Yeah. Have you ever seen one? -No. I've heard about them. I tell ya-- Oh, my gosh. It looks like it's alive. Look at that. It is. It is alive. -Right. -Oh, it is. I'm telling you. You think it's funny? Yeah, I really do. Yeah, well, come see how funny it is. This is really stupid, though. I was going to tell you this earlier, but I decided that, uh, I wasn't going to tell you at all. And then I decided that if we came back here, maybe I would tell you. And now I've decided definitely. So tell me. Between what you're taught where you're caught, with an accent on the latter, you realize it's like you always thought. Only moments matter. Between what you are and what you're not. Dewey. No. I-- -Dewey. You, uh, realize it's like you always thought, those moments matter, I'll tell ya. Cosmopolitan magazine, the guy has trouble with the girl's zipper. What do you do, you know? Hey, let's have a look at you. Ah, no, listen, you uh-- you have really-- I tell you what, I take it back. I mean, you feel better than this does. I mean, and that feels like skin. I mean, you can imagine how you feel, you know? Think of your pleasure, and I'll do the rest. Whatever is your bidding. Let me slip out of my work clothes. Dewey? Dewey? -Shh. Dewey, slow down. MALE VOICE: Dewey! Phew. I needed that. Dewey, what are you doing? Huh? What are you doing? Oh, I-- kinda-- Where are you going? (SINGING) Today you say the one who loves you has turned into a bore. This town and all the people bug you, and now you want more. [SINGING] Nobody cares, Lynn. [SINGING] (SINGING) But you're not enough for LA. Listen, uh-- don't you ever let anyone tell you that, uh-- That? You know, with some-- some Vitamin E, or-- kind of a thing they always say that, uh, with a little lead in your pencil-- but, uh, don't you ever let anyone tell you that-- you-- you really get it on. Now listen, I-- where are your clothes? Uh, why don't you just kind of get your stuff, and I'll just drive you back, and, uh-- listen, I'll probably see you again. The wound was cleaned of bullet and bone fragments in Vietnam, and I performed a cranioplasty here about three months ago. I put a plastic plate in his head. The operation itself is not nearly as serious as the recovery period. Until he's completely healed, any blow, any fall-- any complication could be fatal. Well, doctor, I don't completely understand why you asked for me. As a patient, Domino's been a problem. I was hoping maybe you could talk to him for me. Maybe. Thank you. All right, look, why don't you bring him in, and, uh-- thank you again. I'll be in the bomb shelter, OK? -OK. WOMAN: Dr. Selton, telephone. Dr. Selton, telephone, please. Good morning, Domino. Would you like to follow me, please? Domino? You know, I'm glad I wore this today. When I came here, the sky was falling. If you'll remove your clothes and put this on? Dr. McClintock will be with you in a minute. Um-- you may change in the examining room. No, this is fine. Well, if you're shy, you can turn your back. Not at all. I understand you were in Vietnam? Yeah. What, do you want to see my snapshots of Bob Hope? How far do you think you're going, huh? I think that's far enough. You know, you may think that was a very hip number you just pulled, but as far as I'm concerned, you're just like all the other little nurses. You're cold. Domino, I'd like to help you. Yeah? Well, I don't need any help from a bedpan stewardess. Well, Domino, how are we? We? We, doctor? How long have you had double vision? Hi. I'd like to speak to Dr. Elton Sanders, please? He's in there. Thank you. All right. Hey, now that's a big boy. Dr. Sanders? Hm? Oh, you're welcome. Now, he's going to need a booster in about six months, OK? All right. OK, now what's your problem? Doctor, I'm a student nurse, and I was wondering if you could use some help? Us? Well, I had you figured for a BB kid. Well, when can you start? Um-- Lola. I'm a student nurse at South Bay. At South Bay, huh? Black nurse at South Bay? Why did they ever let you in? I lied about my color. Them bastards have been lying to me for about two years now. I know. I saw you in Dr. Sutton's office, but I don't think you noticed me. Well, I certainly would have remembered if I did. Black beauty in the snow. You know, there isn't a black inter or resident anywhere at that place. My application's been turned down three times already. Why? Well, it's as simple as this. At South Bay you're black first, and a doctor second. Hey Elton, listen, I've got work to do. Mm-hm. All right. Just go ahead in. I'll be right with you. Hey, look, I'll give you a buzz at the hospital, and we'll work out your hours for you, all right? Mm-hm. Hey, and thanks for coming. -Thanks for being here. -Wow! What's that? Come here! Look at this! Hurry! [SIREN] OK, Roger, bring the stretcher. Let's get him out of here. I've been working on this beach for nearly a year now. Guess I should be used to it. What was that all over him? Oil? Looked like oil. Hi. I didn't know you were a biker. Is that yours? Just finished rebuilding it. Hasn't been ridden since before I was-- Did you used to, uh, race motorcycles? Still do. Getting ready for my triumphant return to Ascot. Look, what are you trying to do? Kill yourself, or something? Come here. I've been waiting a long time to ride this thing back into the world. When it starts, the first kick. [ENGINE REVVING] Why don't you come up and, uh, watch me practice some time? Hey, Randall, how did you do this? I guess I fell down on my ass. Hey, Elton, Malcolm's hurt. Yeah, he breathed. ELTON: Well, what happened, man? We were playing in the old Preston house, and-- and he fell through the boards. You coming, man? ELTON: Yeah. Yeah, come on. Get my bag. OK. Tell me what happened, Len. I don't know. Look, now, if you want me to help the man, you gotta tell me, or he's going to die right here. Me and Malcolm was playing war, and he hit me with a stick. So I hit him back in the throat. We've gotta perform a tracheonomy right now. Now, move. Go call an ambulance. He's still drawing blood. -Keep swabbing. Tubing. [GASPING] Hey, he's going to be all right, man. Covering Vinny with still smoking gat, he thrust his meaty paw into her dress, and ripped out the miniature microphone. Never taking his light grey eyes from her smoldering lips, he cooed to the mic, the game is over, Lefty. Up against the wall. Excuse me, Mrs. Reagan. I'll be right back. I talked to the medical examiner's office this morning. Uh, the cause the death of the man on the beach was drowning. Drowning? Still unidentified. What about the oil on the water? Lynn, have you ever been out on the water? No, not there. No. Well, I have this boat at the marina. I was wondering, maybe we could go out, and I could show you-- Um-- well, doctor, I'm very busy. Strictly medicine. Well, um-- Think about it. OK, I will. Excuse me. Now, let me see, Mrs. Reagan, where were we? The game is over, Lefty. Up against the wall. Oh, right. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. [INAUDIBLE] here. The hell did you bring me in here for? We're celebrating. We saved a boy's life, remember? Next time, how about bringing me some place where I can be more at home? -I'll try to remember. -Lola. How are ya? Who's your friend? Elton, this is Dr. McClintock. Hi, how are ya? What do you do, Elton? Uh, I'm in medicine. I'm a doctor. -I'm sorry. I can't hear ya. -I said, I'm a doctor. That so? Where? How about a dance, Lola? Make yourself at home, Miss Lola. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) One boy, holding you closer. One girl, squeezing you tight. One child, younger and older. One love, beautiful sight. One love, beautiful sight. One love, beautiful sight. One love, beautiful sight. [APPLAUSE] Practice makes perfect. If I'd hit on this before, I would have won. That's what helped keep me alive in Nam. That's all part of Domino's post war boom. Well, while you were away, we all got stoned. Oh, yeah. Things like that that made it all worthwhile. For the same reasons you were getting loaded in Vietnam. Christ, don't try to cop in now, Spring, now that we're back. I hate the ones who stayed home and hid, man, just as much as I hate the ones who sent us over there to die. I stayed home. Well, we were alone over there, and that's just the way it's going to be back here. -Yeah. Just a boy and his bike. You know, if I'd lived through Vietnam, I think I'd find some nice, quiet beach house somewhere, and never move. I tried that. I need this. When I ride this bike, I know I'm alive. Even when you're one mistake from death? Well, on a bike I can keep from making that mistake. I know how. Racing motorcycles? Spring, that's an incredible rationale. Your responsibility is to Domino. You're close to him. Use that closeness to convince him. I can't if I don't believe. In his head, that motorcycle is the only way that-- that he can readjust to this world. I wish I had the power to hospitalize him, and keep him in this world. I don't think Domino needs us to protect him. He's a symptom, not a disease. And the cure, doctor? That bike. I want him to want to live. Spring-- Spring, you're gambling with Domino's life. I hope that you can live with the consequences if you're wrong. I've come to talk with you. Why did you leave me? Well, Shlumfeller's just isn't what's happening for me. That's all. Why do you feel you have to keep hiding yourself in the ghetto all the time? I'm not hiding, honey. I go where I'm happy. If you're happier in the white man's world, that's cool. Don't give me that blacker than thou crap. I paid my dues. Well, you have a way of showing your ethnic pride a bit differently, that's all. I'm black, but I'm also a woman. A woman of the whole world. And I intend to be part of it all. Now, don't go. Don't go. Stay a while. Going away makes coming home nicer. So that's why you went away, huh? So you could come back as a nurse? No. I've come back a nurse because they wouldn't let me come back a doctor. As a what? I applied for medical school in my first year of college. I had the grades. I suspect that I somehow got by the quota Now, there's a quota on black doctors, you know? I think that's why they turned you down. I thought it was because I was a woman. Mm-hm. A black woman. [MUSIC PLAYING] Santa Monica Bay, serving as a cesspool for the sewage treatment plant, a percolator for the power generating station, a grease pit for the oil companies, and a bilge dump for the coastal tankers. I read that the government splits the fines paid by companies convicted of pollution. We can retire from the fines on this bay alone. Um, Doug, with all the stuff they're pouring in the water, how do we know when the ocean's safe? Well, they have, uh, governmental agencies that keep watch on that. Yeah, well, the government's the biggest polluter of all. I mean, who watches them? I tell you what, why don't we go down to the beach, and we'll do a little testing by ourselves? How's that sound? Um-- fine. Where are you going? Probably spend the summer following the Grand National Circuit around the country. Oh, will you come anywhere near the Dakotas? There's a race in Peoria, Illinois. Why? Well, I spend part of my summers on a Sioux reservation in North Dakota. Yeah, doing what? Helping the medicine man? No. I work on a mobile clinic with some other student nurses. And you don't even get a draft deferrment? You know, the Indians-- they're like the soul brothers in Nam. They'd rather help themselves. Who needs a missionary? How, now I'm not a missionary. A missionary peddling white, middle class America. Use my soap and be clean like me. Cook your food like me. Oh, and hey, chief, here's some of my old clothes. Be sure and dress like me. It's the same old bullshit. Well, it's not bullshit to me. I'd like to see children smile again. A mother and baby live, and maybe a grandfather-- come on, now. What's wrong with that? You want to do something useful? I'll lend you my garage. You can start making bombs. Well, if I wanted to make bombs, I'd use my own garage. Yeah, you're right, Spring. Don't listen to anybody. I don't. Well, your example has been an inspiration to me. Mm-hm. You see that, Lin? Yeah. See how the water's turning a little yellowish? Yeah. Just barely. That's because there's a slight bit of [INAUDIBLE]. And if there was more, it would be a definite yellow. What does it mean? It means that's, uh, a little higher than it should be. Even dangerous. Not toxic. You mean it couldn't kill anybody. Yet. -Morning. -Hi. Get you anything? No, just water. Whatcha doing? Uh, we're, uh, checking the seawater out for, uh, pollutants, poisons. Why is that? Well, a dead man was found up on the beach last week, and was covered with some sort of oil, and-- Are you with the city? We're doing this ourselves. Maybe I could give you a bit of advice. See, this city depends on people who come to the beach every summer. People who spend a lot of money. Now, what do you suppose would happen to all that money if some ecology nut started a rumor that our waters were covered with oil, and chemicals, and poisons, and our beaches were littered with dead seagulls, and fish? Won't be long until that becomes a reality. Already starting rumors. That's dangerous. Just what the hell do you want? I want you out of Manhattan Beach. I can make it very unpleasant for you. You son of a bitch. Accidents happen. You're dripping. I just cannot figure something out. There's a crying need for doctors at South Bay, and he won't even talk to me. Well, maybe by the time I get around to my internship, he'll be a little more enlightened. Your what? I've considered reapplying for medical school. No, no. One doctor in the family is enough, honey. I'm going to start a hospital down here, and I'll need a good nurse. What about two good doctors? Lola, you know the problems in a hospital. I'm going to need somebody to-- Make beds, pick up bedpans, clean. No, no, no. That's not what I mean. I know what you're talking about. But there are a lot of black doctors out here who have just about got a foot in the door. And it's up to black women to help us make it first, and then you. I still don't see why-- Look, Lola, I need you, honey. I need you desperately, but I'm not taking anymore shit from South Bay. They can fuck themselves. Now, I don't know how, and it probably won't be me, but there's going to be a black doctor on the staff of South Bay before I'm through. Now, are you with me? -Of course. -Outta sight. I can feel your heart beating. Normal. I like you this way. Better enjoy you while I can. Don't. Don't say it. Whatever it is. Hey. -Hey! Come on! -Can I say it now? -Well, yeah. Yeah, now you can say it. Would you close the door, please? Where were you last night, Don? Last night I spent a week at the [INAUDIBLE]. You'd better get some sleep. I will. I'll see you later, doctor. -Right. Cholera? Why did you give me this? Well, it's a public health bulletin. Mm-hm. A case was reported in Santa Barbara. Read the symptoms. Severely wrinkled skin, sunken eyes. That's like the man on the beach. -Look, it's a possibility. -Hm. I don't know. I asked the, uh, medical examiner for a picture of the man on the beach. I think we ought to go down there and find out if anyone else knows him. Do you think there could be an epidemic? That's not likely. But you know, someone could have been exposed to the same source. They could be in trouble. No. Doesn't look familiar. Hey, babe. Hi, Dewey. Well, where you been? Where have you been? I said to myself, where is Lynn? I said, how come she hasn't come over? How come I haven't heard from her? I was even gonna-- I was even gonna say to myself-- now, I must lie. I must tell a lie, and pretend to come over and fix your sink, or something. Would you want me to do that? -So it's come to that. No. Huh? Well, show him the picture. You know that man? Yes. Uh, yes. I feel like I've seen him at, uh, Shlumfeller's, and some of the bars around. Hi. This is some decent material, there. [INAUDIBLE] very nice fabric. Listen, you're looking good, babe. So are you. You come over and see me, you hear? Any time you want to do it. Listen, keep it up, babe? OK. Looking good. Looking good. Really. I only went out with him once. [KNOCKING] WOMAN: They forced their way in! All right, doctor. What is it this time? You'll begin to reprocess the applications of black doctors immediately. I see. We're not leaving until there's a black doctor on the staff of this hospital. What makes you think that this is necessary? Because you've consistently refused to consider the application of any black doctor for internship or residency. I wasn't aware of any discrimination. Get up. Do we have to play these silly games? This is not a game to me. Out. A sit in, doctor? Isn't that just a little passe? You think anyone really cares anymore? We'll soon see about that, won't we? Now get out. Have you ever applied here, doctor? You know very well I have. Well, don't bother to reapply. I don't have to, doctor. I have my own hospital now. Well, that's [INAUDIBLE], huh? Code of hospital ethics. Gentlemen, shall we retire to the ballroom? ANNOUNCER: And in the third spot in the second row, number 26, Edward. Next lane also, number 32, from Vermosa Beach, Domino Cole. And the flag drops. It's a race! Oh, we have a rider down in the first lap. [INAUDIBLE] OK. They're charging far on the outside. It's 32 R. Domino Cole has found a spot in the dangerous secondary groove. And the leaders, again, are Ray Demarco, Edelson, Greetins, and Domino. Domino continues his pursuit of the leaders, passing Greetins and Edelson. He's pulled out all the stops, and is at the number 74 Kawasaki mounter, named Goodman. [INAUDIBLE] and continues his narrow run. And Domino passes Goodman in the air, as they flash over the jump right in front of us. One down, six to go. Domino continues to ride that dangerous outside groove, charging at the leaders as they gear down for a turn. Oh, we have a leader down. Looks like Demarco-- Ray Demarco, hands up? Thet're all right. And we have a new leader, number 77-- With two laps remaining, the riders are flying. Flying. A tight match between 94, Bill Greetins of Latvia, and 24, Mike Shaw. Oh, and there goes a rider. The other rider-- No! ANNOUNCER: It's 32R, Domino. His hand is not raised. And the black flag is out. They've stopped the race. Let's have the ambulance, turn one. Let's have the ambulance to turn one. The ambulance, please. Right away. Now that there's a break in the action, may I invite you to sample the goodies at the snack bar? Ice cold beer. Ambulance! Ambulance! Ambulance! Looks like we're gonna have to operate again, Spring. The crash caused the plastic plate to slip. Pressure on the occipital lobe, and hemorrhaging of the old wound. Will he be all right? I don't know. It's a serious complication. It's the operation, the cranioplasty-- very difficult. We'll just wait a few days until the bleeding subsides, and then-- -Can I help? Of course. Oh, god, I thought this was the right way. I'm so sorry. [INAUDIBLE]. Maybe between the two of us, we can put him back together again. All right? [MUSIC PLAYING] There's a problem. (SINGING) There once was a [INAUDIBLE]. Should it be of, or about, or possibly about? -Let me make a suggestion. -No. MAN: Oh, yeah, yeah. He used to come in here all the time. I don't know his name, though. Well, was he with anybody? A girl? A girl? No. A curly head guy. Always wore sunglasses, day and night. Well, do you know where he lived? No, I don't. I'm sorry, Lynn. But I'll ask around. If I find out anything, I'll, uh, let you know. OK. Thanks, Dave. Well, hello. What do, Dewey? Listen, um-- first of all, I want to say to you that I am-- I'm sorry, forever and ever. And that the next time, I promise you that, uh, you can spend the whole night. Dewey, you are a sexual epileptic. If I got up on that bandstand and told everyone what a lousy lay you were, you would have to move all the way to West Covina. Shut up! Now, first of all, you have no sense of humor. That's for openers. You, um-- think that I am full of shit. I am full of shit! But so is everyone in this room, and at least I'm honest about it. Now, you take your lads from the university, see, and their world, and you can take that whole thing, because that is changing. See, I bring mine with me. My man. Come on. Now, you come with me, OK? Dewey, that isn't even tempting. Let go of me. OK. TV: Television network presents Doctor's Hospital. Dr. Jeff Cotty has just learned that his ex-wife, Margaret, has been admitted to the psychiatric wing of Doctor's Hospital, and he is rushed to the office of the head of psychiatric research, Dr. Judson Taylor. MAN ON TV: How is she, doctor? MAN ON TV: It's hard to say, Jeff. She's been through a lot lately. I was worried the divorce was a strain, but I had no idea-- MAN ON TV: Look, Judd, we're old friends. Lay it out to me as straight as you can. Is she capable of maintaining a proper home for-- [GASP] Oh my god. What are you doing here? [GASPING] No! No! No! [SCREAMING] Stop! [SCREAMING] No! No! No! You won't play detective again. No! [SCREAMING] By the way, doctor, Elton and I have a responsibility here. We're black doctors. But why are you here? Well, I always go with the winner, baby. You know. But tell 'em, Elton. Really. Why? -Oh, uh, it's like this, man. I-- I promised him an honorary nigger card. -Oh. -I'm Dr. Wasp. Nice to meet you. Long. Long. Oh, I get ya. How about you, baby? Now we got it. Hold on. It's locked. I'll open it. Doug! Oh my god. Calm down. Calm down. Take it easy. We're going to the police. -No. Not the police. Then there wouldn't be any reason for us to be together. But is there a reason for us ever to be together? Yes. Lynn, I have been totally dishonest with you. And-- and every time that we-- every time we try to get together, we-- we just don't connect. And that's my fault. I think about us always. I think about making love with you. And sailing. But every time I think about when I-- when I thought I was making love, and I wasn't. There can be time for us. Time for honesty. And maybe even time for us to sail together. I don't want you to do anything. That's the Chicago game, playing right into their hands. Just sit tight. That way we won't have any newspaper or TV men down here. They'll get bored and go away as soon as they realize that nobody cares anymore. MAN: Right. You know, what I can't understand is why any young girl wants to hang around a place like this. Hospitals are prisons. Morgues. Why do you really think I hang around here? I don't want to play any mind games. Because a hospital is a place of life, not death. You see death in everything. Why not life? Part of my military training. Oh, come on. I declare the war is over. Well, it's not for me. It's not for me and my buddies who were over there with me. The snob vets are gonna run this country someday. Just like the vets did after World War I, and World War II. One stoned killer from Nam on TV is worth 10 million old timey vets. Stoned killer? That's right. Screw the hard hats. Screw the hippies, stoned killers. Baby, the only thing that killers bring is death. Whether they're stoned or not. Death-- forget death. I love you. I really love you. Please live. For me? [KNOCKING] OK, OK. All right. Now, what's happening? Nothing. Nothing? Sutton says you'll get tired of playing when you realize nobody cares. Nobody cares? Hear that, man? Nobody cares. All right. Let's do a little PI work. I want you to get on these phones, and I want you to call every newspaper, every radio station, every TV station within 100 miles. All right? Hey, uh, Lola? Are you staying? Well, I guess I can handle a few phone calls. Woo hoo! Give me another shot of whatever that was. [INAUDIBLE]. May I have 419, please? Can I have some more? Suction, please. Here. Keep monitoring the vital signs, Charles. Right. How much damage do we have? Extensive. The plate turned nearly 180 degrees. It may be impeding the flow of blood to the brain. (SINGING) There once was a trail of an old country man. And Cindy is beautiful. He found her one day, with the shoemaker's son, and there in the greenbriar's [INAUDIBLE]. And there in the greebriar's [INAUDIBLE]. Hey, are these kids terrific, Doug? Really packed the place. Guess how many beers we poured last night? Look, Dave, I really don't have the time or the patients to play games. Who the hell is he? All right, Doug. OK. If it means that much to you. I think his name is Ahmed. He lives in that corner house on 6th Street and Manhattan. Thanks. Where are you going? I'm going to Ahmed's. [KNOCKING] Ahmed? You Ahmed? [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] [CRYING] Right away. My name is Kirby. I'm with the Federal Narcotics Bureau. We've been watching Ahmed and Sulef, the dead man, ever since they returned from Turkey. They're narcotics smugglers. Sulef contracted cholera on the last trip and died. Ahmed dumped him in the ocean to eliminate the connection with Turkey. I've been watching you two for the last couple of weeks. I didn't you think you'd get this far. My name is Kirby. My name is Kirby. Kirby. I'm with the Federal Narcotics Bureau. Federal Narcotics Bureau. Why couldn't you tell us what was happening? Why did you have to play your cop number? We wanted to ask you about the three doctors who are up in your office. Pease, it's all a misunderstanding. -But doctor-- -Excuse me. I'll have a statement for you later. Are there any nurses is in there with you? Please. All right. Let's get this little exercise in sociology settled before it goes any further. You know the conditions, doctor. I met with the board of directors, and we're prepared to guarantee that a black doctor will be added to the staff of this hospital within one month, provided-- -Oh. Provided, huh? Provided. You hear that? Here it comes. Provided that you label this entire incident a misunderstanding, and say nothing else to the press about it. Mm-hm. I don't know about that, doctor. Listen, I've gone as far as I can with this guerrilla theatre script of yours. You do as I say, or-- Goddamnit. You're in no position to dictate anything to anyone. You understand that? We've got what we came for. We're not here to punish him. WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Dr. Sutton, please report to the emergency room. Code 99. All right. Elvin, you were beautiful, baby. -Thank you. -Beautiful. 30 days, baby. 30 days. Come on. Oh. Oh. Oh! Thank you, and-- you've been beautiful. Operating room one, doctor? Well, the clinic's got a cranioplasty there. Take him to four. Come on, get him out of here. Who shot him? I don't know. Hold that right there. Shot [INAUDIBLE]. He was with who? Lynn. -Is Lynn here now? -Let's get this-- Has anybody told Angela? I think she's on her way over here. First I'll need the forceps. Is that the bullet? That's it. It looks like it may have pierced the left ventricle. Jesus Christ. Plant nurse, more nectin. That's three, doctor. The bullet pierced a ventricle. Prepare for an emergency throacotomy. Hemostat, please. Thank you. How's that pressure? He's holding his own. Scalpel. Anybody hear anything on Doug's condition? Extremely critical. Dr. Sutton himself is operating. Bandage, please. -All the rest is up to you. -God! Oh, thank you. All right, they're coming out now. [INAUDIBLE]. It's really a mess. Yeah, this is a bad one, here. My god. Take his pressure. The pressure's dropping. The blood loss from the bullet entering the ventricle has collected, and it's blocking the pericardial sac. Blood pressure and pulse negative. More nectin? Too late for that. There's no blood flow to the rest of the body. If we can drain the sac, there's a chance. -Are you Lynn? -Yes. I understand you were with my husband when he was shot. Angela? I'm afraid Dr. Selvin died on the operating table. DOUG (VOICEOVER): There can be time for us. Time for honesty. Maybe even time for us to sail together. You'll make a great lady doctor. A great doctor. OK, doctor. Hey, OK. OK. I'm convinced, I'm convinced. When women are women instead of ladies, then men can be men, instead of gentlemen. OK, OK, doctor. Welcome home. Wait, let me see if I got that. Now, when women are men-- no, when girls and boys-- uh, no. Hey. You laughed. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-- I'm coming out of the fog, I think. you know? I'm starting to feel things again. Hey. Are you still racing this summer? Nah. Nah, I thought I'd, uh, go see some Indians, or something. North Dakota? I've saved you. Yeah. See, I told you you were a missionary. I'm not converted yet, but I think maybe there's some things I missed while I was out of town. Maybe. [MUSIC PLAYING]
