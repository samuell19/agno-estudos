Hey! Come here. Take the money. We're like brothers. Let's not do this. I feel terrible in front of these kids. I'll talk to Chairman Shin, so cough it up. I'm worried I might have to kill you. You can let me go if you're that worried. I didn't say I wouldn't. Tell me where the money is and I'll bring you a cab. Like I said, I tossed it in the ocean. Who throws away 30 billion won? I've had it! Make me a drink. Yes, boss. What is it? What? Use a damn bottle opener. I told you to use a bottle opener. Come closer! How many times do I have to tell you? You look so old that I feel guilty for hitting you! -I'm sorry, boss. -Try covering your forehead. You open it. Yes, boss. -You idiot. -I'm sorry… -I'm so unfortunate! -Sorry! Forgive me! I'm so pitiful, aren't I? Quite unfortunate. Come closer. Come closer, at the same time. Hey, Mr. Ma! Could you just kill me? BECAUSE IT'S SAD BEING ALONE This is an urgent notice… MR. MA You're finally up? Where the hell are you? Answer me! Why are you so angry? Don't let me catch you. I will kill you. Stop that. You can't kill me. -I'll see you in hell. -Asshole, don't hang up before… SHE WAS SPEECHLESS WITH HATRED AND RAGE… WIFE Are you Incomplete Life? Sorry to bother you. That's right. My life has always been incomplete. But I plan to complete it today. So good to meet you. I'm Incomplete Life. Yes, I see. I'm Final Flame. It's about time everyone came. Would you like some coffee? No, I don't really drink coffee. Thank you for starting this meaningful group. With you in the lead, someone like me could follow. I'm so grateful. We have to help each other. Isn't that what life is? Is no one else here yet? I don't know their faces. That's right. I was the contact point. I also don't know their faces. How many are there in total? It's four, including us. They should be here by now. Hello? Rose of Betrayal? This is Final Flame. Where are you? Seoul? If you're still in Seoul… What? That's too bad. Don't tell anyone about us meeting here. Okay, take care. Are they not coming? They haven't decided yet. Come on… They shouldn't have RSVPed for this. Dammit… Darn. It's not an easy decision. -The two of us can… -Wait a minute. Hello? Grade-based Happiness? This is Final Flame. Where are you? Where? I'm in the café. Where are you? Over here! I'm Final Flame. The youngest member is the last to arrive. I had an incident on the way here. -What kind? -It's nothing at all. This is Incomplete Life, and Grade-based Happiness. Good to meet you. I'm Incomplete Life. What's with you? -So happy to meet you. -I am too. One second. Are you hungry by any chance? Well, a bit. I ate before I came. Let's eat some noodles. We should eat good food before we go. It's not a bad idea. It's like a bucket list. Let's go eat. What's a bucket list? It's a list of things you want to do before dying. -Should we order some lamb skewers? -Sure. How about a shot of Baijiu? Sure, why not. My name is Ahn Byung-nam. -I'm Yook Sim-sun. -Mr. Yook… I'm Yang Du-seok. -What's that? -It's nothing. -Are those pills? -It's to help with digestion. I turned 39 this year. I'm 43. You're several years my senior. And how old are you? I'm 22. You're still a baby. Don't call him that. A baby with glasses. Let me pour myself a drink. -Baby, look. -Be careful. A clumsy fellow. -Here. -Here. Should we order another? It's enough. We may ruin our plan if we drink more. You're so right. -Shall we? -Yes, sir. I have one too! A bucket list. It's like on TV and the movies. A man and his son scrub each others' backs, and drink banana milk afterwards. I've always wanted to try it. I'm happy I could do this. Doesn't it feel good after a visit to the sauna? I thought I was being skinned alive. How much for these three suits? That's 780 thousand won. Sir, I'll pay for it. That's your license. Oops. You're being too kind to us. Thank you. Do you have any socks? The sun will rise again tomorrow, but this is our last sunset. Sir… there's no sun. Do you not see the sun behind the clouds? The clouds will subside and the rosy sun will reveal itself. Wasn't that lightning just now? Even the heavens weep for us. Our society forced us to the cliff, but the heavens are on our side. That sounds so cool… All right, do we have any more regrets? I feel free and very good. Me too. Okay, let's get going. Adios. CHAIRMAN SHIN HYUN JOON This is oolong tea, sent by the Busan mob. Thank you very much. You're a busy man. You could've called. Why did you come in person? -Mr. Ma? -Yes, chairman. Why are you so nervous? We're actively looking for it, if you give us some time… So how much time… What happened? What? Did you find it? Did you find the money? -Where? Changwon? -Changwon? -Where? Changwon? -Changwon? This asshole… Okay. -Mr. Chairman. -Yes. -We found it. -The money? No, Ahn's whereabouts. -What about the money? -We'll find it. Does Ahn have the money? No, I'll find out once I get down there. Then allow me to give you a mental refresher. What? Come to Changwon now? I'll be right there. Okay, hold on. -Here are your gloves. -Sir, the door's locked. That's because I locked it. -I really have to go. -No, you can stay a bit. -Please open the door. -It won't open. Please open it! Here's an iron. -Is it locked from outside? -It's futile. -Here we go. -Go away! -Get ready. -Please, don't! Go away! This one might be a little dangerous, but I think it'll be okay. What is she saying? She says this one will hurt. -Damn it! -Mr. Ma! -I have a favor. -Yes? If you move, your bones may break. -Hold on. -Sir, hit me all over. Cover yourself with this. -Will it work? -Of course. It'll absorb the shock. -Mr. Ma, for real now. -Okay. That's 30 billion won! It's not 30 million. It's 30 billion won! You bastard! I can't go to Changwon like this. I didn't think this was your preference… No, hold on a sec. I had no idea. Did you not know? I asked for the best room. Is it too much for three guys? I love it though. They might get suspicious if we ask for a different room. I see your point. I'm fine with it too. Who'd expect a group suicide at a place like this? It's an ironic provocation against our society. How do you come up with these cool phrases? Everything you say is so shwit. "Shwit…" Did he say "sweet" or "shit"? Allow me to pour you all a shot. It's the last drink. We'll drink again in the next life. Do ghosts come back to drink? Let's drink until we drop. What if we don't die in one go later? -What's this? -A painless way to go. It's too small to die in one go. Don't underestimate small things. How am I supposed to believe if I can die in one go? This thing has no reviews, which means it never fails. So are you a college student? I'm a three-time repeater. What? I got rejected three times. Not once, twice but thrice? Yes. Were you aiming for a good school? No, just a two-year community college. Isn't it pathetic? No, not at all. No. College is overrated. College rejects aren't even treated as human in my family. I'm home! My son is back. Did you have dinner? Not yet. What would you like? I'll fix you something good. Wash up and have dinner. Good boy. Give up on Du-seok, that idiot. Why can't he be half as smart as his brother? Why is he like that? Pretend we only have one son. Food is a waste on him. I wanted to give up much earlier… Giving up also requires strength. You must be stressed out. Whenever I wanted to give up, people kept telling me to have hope. Hope is like betting your life on the lowest probability. Sir, everything you say feels like poetry-- Negativity wrapped in positivity only led you to this tragic path. You're a victim! Am I really? -Of course. -Sim-sun! Unjust society is to blame! Sim-sun… Sir… It must've been hard on you. But it feels good to let it all out like an unclogged pipe. How refreshing. Wait. What do you mean refreshing? That's a dangerous sentiment. You might get soft and change your mind later. We might not even be friends under different circumstances. Stay on your toes. Okay, I'll remember that. Du-seok. You're still undeniably a loser. It's mine. Yes, hello? The police? Yes, I made the report. Here? Well, I am at… What are you doing? I found a wallet on the way and made a report, the owner wants to come and reward me. Are you nuts? He can't come here! Just say you'll come by tomorrow. I'll come by tomo… But there's no tomorrow for us. Then just say you can't come tomorrow! I can't come tomorrow! -Hang up! -Hang up! -Hang up! -Hey! You came here to die. Why'd you go to the police? So do I just leave the wallet? It's too painful for the owner! -Finders keepers! -Oh, man… Why would you give it back? You idiot. My dream is to be a cop! If I do good deeds, wouldn't I go to heaven? Suicide is a ticket to hell. Really? If you defy your fate, you're hell-bound. Even if I returned the wallet? You can take that wallet to hell. At least you'll have some money there. Heaven will not open to those who commit suicide. Don't even bother. Don't be disappointed about that. What do you do? I'm a writer. I write screenplays. No wonder. GRAND PRIZE YOOK SIM-SUN Mr. Yook, will you keep this up? It's so long overdue. I'm sorry… Admit it. You can't even finish a script. There's a rumor of you being done for. Your characters don't feel alive at all, let alone the story. Do you get what I'm saying? Your script is dead on arrival! I'm not a greedy man. I want to complete the script with my thoughts and my story, but once I got stuck, I can't seem to finish it. Were you writing a script on your laptop? Yes. I wanted to finish it but I just can't seem to. Tell us your story. There isn't much to it. It's a cliché. I got bankrupt, amassed debt, had a divorce. The end. We're kind of lucky in a twisted way. We get a chance to reflect our lives. Those who die unexpectedly never get this chance. All right. I feel like I won't get drunk tonight no matter how much we drink. Here. Let me see. You look good. Wait a minute. They're empty. What's the point of wearing just the frame? -To look smart. -Hold on. This is much better. This looks better. Sir, it was a brilliant idea to end our lives in style. The end of a person's life must be immaculate. Are you all ready? Du-seok… Don't cry. You should laugh on such a good day. Why are you crying too? Sir… Should we become blood brothers? Blood brothers? I like that. Let the three of us be blood brothers. Like in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. I'm Liu Bei. I'm Guan Yu. I'm Zhang Fei. We may not be related, but we pledge loyalty to each other. We entered this world separately, but we leave together! Does anyone object? -No, sir. -No, sir. We drink at the count of three. One! Two! Three! Whose is it? It's not mine. Sorry, hold on. Hello? What? Really? What is it? Rose of Betrayal's at Changwon station. What's the point? Tell him to go away. Yeah? Okay. Hello? Yes. Then I'll text you the address. Please hurry. We'll wait for you. Sir, why did you tell him to come? She just got off the train. How can I tell her to go home? Is it a woman? Du-seok, what's with you? I think I drank some. What if I die first? Suck it up. Where the hell is she? It takes five minutes. Are you sure she was at the station? Sir, why don't we have her cup ready to drink? That's a good idea. She's finally here. Look at the time. Tell her to come and drop dead. Stop it… How long will you have her stand there? You must've been caught in the rain. My heart is getting soaked too. Use this towel. Thank you. -Sit here please. -Okay. Sit over here. Grab a chair for yourself. Thank you. Is a bird chirping? There is a bird in heat. Use this to cover your legs. Thank you. You have such good manners. Manners make the man. This room feels a bit… It's his style. No, it's not like that. Who'd ever expect anyone to commit suicide here? Consider it an ironic provocation against our society. It sounds like a movie quote. I'm the host of this group, Final Flame, Ahn Byung-nam. Good to meet you. -Likewise. -And I'm-- This is Incomplete Life, Yook Sim-sun. -I'm-- -And this is Grade-based Happiness, Yang Du-seok. Now, your turn. I'm Rose of Betrayal. My name is Lee Mi-ji. -Good to meet you all. -Nice to meet you. You've already got started. We've only had about three bottles. Can I have a drink too? -Wait! -No! Stop! That one's poisoned. We were actually about to die. We heard you were coming and spiked it beforehand. Then, shall we begin? Okay. Wait a minute. I just got here. Am I supposed to drink this now? -Of course not. -Are you nuts? That'd be insane. While on the train, I thought about who you were and why you wanted to die. And let's all have fun and die happily. -Good? -Certainly. I like that. Oh, right. We ran out of booze. We'll have to buy more. -Okay! Who? -You. Zhang Fei, go ahead. Me? Give me some money. Are you penniless? I'll buy it. I'll buy it since I was late. I'll go with you. Okay. -No, I'll go with you. -It's fine. -I'll pay. -Rest easy. Du-seok, should I go? I could go too. Did you see the look on that bastard's face? I'm going to wash up. But we just got back from the sauna. What's with him? What's wrong with me? No wonder I wanted to wear this. Come on. What kind of a man is Final Flame? Mr. Ahn? He's great. He bought me this suit. Really? It looks expensive. Right? He bought it for us saying that we should end our lives in style. He must've been a hot shot, he burns through money. Really? -Thanks for coming. -You too. Where is everyone? What the… Hey! Mr. Ahn! No! Wake up! You can't die like this! Sir! Are you okay? Gosh! I thought you were dead! You startled me! Sorry. -I fell asleep. -What? What happened? You're amazing. You've just met him. I'd have done the same if it was you. Really? Did something happen? Why are you in your undies? What's with him? We must enforce the fashionably late rule. What's that? You're so lucky you don't know so much. It's a rule where the last person to arrive must drink three shots. I really can't drink. Could you ease up on that rule? Of course not. Please? How could we? We're drinking because of you. Du-seok, speak some sense into them. No way, a rule is a rule. There's three of us, so take a drink from each. Yes, that'll do. Here you go. Wait… You guys are suspicious. Are you trying to get me drunk and have your way with me? What's with you all? Can't I make a joke? Why did you freeze up? Come on, drink. Get drunk and see if we do anything to you. Three straight shots are a bit much. Take my drink. Mine too. All right. Let's get it started. You too, Hot Bod. Don't say that. Weren't you in your undies to show off your body? Of course not. Was it that good? I should've looked closely. I'm curious now. -Why did you take another shower? -Yes, why did you? I wanted to sober up and drink again. How could a man wear hot pink undies? Stop that, it's my anima. What's that? It's Carl Jung's theory on the unconscious, it represents the femininity of man. Don't mistake it for one's sexual preference. Okay, I understand. The suit you are wearing… Yes, that's correct. We may have failed in life, but we'll go out with style, so I bought them a set. Everyone looks so good. What will you wear when you die later? Well… I'm going to die wearing nothing. Is something up there? Mr. Hot Bod, what do you do? I'm a writer. I write scripts. A scriptwriter? I've never met one. That's so cool! It may sound cool but he's nothing. He hasn't written anything, -so climax-anti. -You mean anti-climactic. It's a job that requires just one big shot. It's my job to create images in my head, and I was happy to meet an "image". Ms. Lee Mi-ji. What do you do? I'm a grad student. A grad student… What do you two do? He lived a wild life with a debt and divorce. He's a community college reject. A failure in life. You speak so well for someone who can't write. Du-seok, you shouldn't say that. But he called me a failure in life. You two are the same. Don't insult each other. You're both in the same boat. We have to care for one another. Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, drink and make peace. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -Very good. -Why do you call them that? We became blood brothers. I'm Liu Bei, from Romance of the Three Kingdoms. I get it now. You're so good to them. -That's sweet. -Come on. -Can I call you "sweetie"? -Yes, absolutely. Not you, mister. -You. -Sure. I'm a mister, and he's a sweetie. That's not right! Why not? It's my choice. Sweetie, be comfortable around me. -Should I? -Sure. Then tell us your story. What? Do I have to? We all shared our stories. This boy, this sweetie, and this mister too. -It's your turn, woman. -Oh, gosh. It's good to open up since we'll die together. -Certainly. -Tell us your story. Okay. Give me a shot first. All right. Together. Are you okay? I started dating him not long after I got into college. We were happy. We respected and cared for each other. He did everything for me. It's maxed out. I doubt it. Please try again. I'm sorry. Things weren't always rosy. We fought often but once night fell we always made up physically. I thought it would last forever. It happened one day when I couldn't reach him I had a weird feeling, and went to his house. Go inside first. Don't play dumb. We had our fun. You milked me plenty. You bastard… Don't be pathetic. You'll regret it. I loved him so much. I should've just had fun. I have instincts and desires too. I should've met guys and have one night stands! Honestly, aren't I hot enough? -Sure. -You're more than enough. -You're way hotter. -You're the hottest. No, it's all over. It's too late. You're earliest the moment you realize you're late. It is not right to bring grudges into the afterlife. Do you know what's more important than anything right now? It's leaving no regrets behind! No regrets! Are you laughing? Can't you see how serious I am? Laughs can happen even at a funeral. Tears can be shed upon achieving one's dream. Our laughs represent the wish for you to release your regrets, and nothing more. Don't you understand us yet? I'm sorry. I must have misunderstood. Not at all. I never expected you to care for me. You seem like good men. That's enough sob stories. Shall we have some real fun? It tastes good when it's more sour. I hope she's baiting him properly. Of course, her life depends on it. Does Ahn even like girls? -Don't you like girls? -I do. -What about your dad? -He does. -Your dad's dad? -He did. -Your dad's dad's dad? -He did. He should be drooling over her by now. Right. Don't you think it's too quiet? It'd be a problem, if it got rowdy already. Violence doesn't work on him, we have to trick him. I hope he doesn't find out. He didn't even see her face. They just talked on the phone. Isn't that right? Yes. Sir, can't you just let me go? I will, when your replacement finishes the job. I can keep a secret. Please let me go home. You came here to die. Why go home? Mister… But why are you Rose of Betrayal? Because my name is… Rose Bae. I know you feel sorry Boss, that's Poison. Rose of Betrayal goes like, Why did you pick me Of all those people Why did you pick me? Of all the gangsters. I still feel bad for hitting you. Grow old slowly. Yes, boss. -What? -The one and only king! Let me put on my crown! -You're so cheeky. -The King game is pretty much a kiss game. A kiss on the cheeks or lips is for children. I mean a real kiss with tongue. The king is watching. Refuse and you'll be sucking on my big toe. All right. Number 1! Here! I'm Number 1. Who will kiss Du-seok? Number 2! Number 2! Who's Number 2? Not you, right? In your nightmare, I'm Number 3. -Damn it… -It's Mi-ji. This is too much as an ice breaker. -Come on, kiss! -I'm so nervous… Kiss! What the… Refusing to do the king's task means taking a shot. That's not right. Isn't that the truth game? The rule applies in my neck of the woods. -No way! -As the king, I'll set the rules. There are no more shots. The king's order is final and non-negotiable. -Okay? -Of course. I'm the king. Here's my order, I want Number 2 and Number 3 to kiss. I'm Number 2! I got it! That's too bad. I'm Number 1. -That feels good… -Gosh… It feels so good. There! Right there! This is so disgusting. That's enough of this game. Let's play the truth game. Now? They go hand in hand. I'm it, what do I do? Just answer my question. Okay? -Okay. -Who's your favorite politician? One, two, three! I'm spinning the bottle! Du-seok, again! -Damn it… -It's him again. So, who's your favorite politician? One, two, three! Here it goes again. Let's see. My favorite politician is… -Hold on… -Sweetie, I'm so curious about your life. Mi-ji! I remember! My favorite politician is-- Then who's your favorite scientist? -Sweetie. -Scientist? Tell us, I'm dying to know. Right! You actually skipped your story earlier. My story is rather dull. No way. I'm so curious. Tell us, please. Gosh. If you really want to hear it, I have no choice. For work, I was always out and about, meeting people everywhere. I didn't care for my family. I didn't see my daughter growing up. My wife asked for a divorce out of the blue. Rather than getting angry, I felt sorry. So I agreed. But that's not the reason why I came here to die. I know a guy who runs a pharmaceutical company. He once asked me to gather cancer patients for a new experimental drug. CLINICAL TRIAL PATIENTS WANTED I have cancer. Please, start with me. We're all here to help one another. It's for a great cause. This waiver is a mere formality. -If you sign this, we'll hear good news! -Yes! -Yes! -Very good. That's it. How did you get so many people? I run a lot of different things. Online communities, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and so on. That's amazing. Hello? It's pancreatic cancer. It must've been painful. How did you endure it for so long? So that pill you took was… Painkillers. I tried whatever it took to stay alive. It's been a while. What brings you here? Do I need a reason to come see you? Don't be cute. What is it? Spill it. I know a guy. He's a really great guy. So? He recently found out that he has cancer. I told him to get treated, but he's at a late stage. So? Remember that recruitment for cancer patients? Is it possible to get some of those meds? Why are you beating around the bush to ask that? Did I really beat around the bush? But I can't give you that. What? Why? Those aren't meds. Then? Drugs. -What? -What? -Drugs? -Let me finish. It's a stimulant designed to give you relief from pain, developed by Chairman Shin. But it's illegal! Did we ever work legally? But this is wrong! Asshole. They're going to die anyway. Why not be pain-free? "They're going to die anyway"? Do you think you won't die? How could you say that? Aren't cancer patients human too? Why are you so worked up? Quiet down. The walls are thin. Chairman Shin. Yes. There's no need to worry. I have the 30 billion won in my car. It'll go without a hitch. Are you still here? Let's grab a drink. It's been a while. He was supposed to make a deal with that 30 billion won the next day. I'm a bad guy too, but I have my limits. Testing on clueless patients and extorting them is too much. So I stole his money. You're so cool. This story belongs in a movie. So where's the money? Why? Do you want to see it? Of course! You can't. Because I donated it. A donation? You donated the whole 30 billion won? I got to know a community of cancer patient families. Even if I'm going to hell for this, I wanted to relieve their pain at least a little. You're Rose of Betrayal now. Find out where that money is. I'll wipe away your debt, and shred this before your eyes too. You'll be a free woman. -That's so funny! -Mi-ji! -What's so funny? -It's nothing. I heard you from the bathroom. What do we do next? I think we had enough fun. Thank you for waiting and having fun with me. Shall we… get to it? But it's so sudden. You've completely changed. We're here to die after all. -Isn't today April Fool's day? -Yes. If we die today, others will fool each other with our deaths. I'd hate that. -What do you think? -I agree. No one will believe that we're dead. Then we must live past tonight. -No way around it. -Crisis averted. -Nice shot! -Nice shot! There are two more hours until tomorrow. We should live past midnight. We decided to die together. We're blood brothers for a reason. -Nice shot. -Good. Two more hours. I'll pave the way. Join me later. What are you doing? Can't you see? You came last but will go first? This is against the rule. Not two weeks, nor two days, it's just two more hours. Nothing will happen in two hours. What's the rush? -Two hours fly by. -That's right. -Sure! -No problems! It'll be okay. Sure, it's only two hours. Nothing will happen in that time, right? -Of course! -Nothing at all. Time has stopped. Wait! Then this is like bonus time for us! Let's have some real fun! “Finish each day and be done with it, tomorrow is a new day.” Mi-ji, nice shot. Should we do that? Three guys and one girl. Three on one, but I should be able to take you on. Deal? Deal? Deal? No! No! No! Don't fall over! They're so damn noisy! I can't focus! How many people are in one room? Maybe they're swingers. That's all the rage nowadays. Dang, I was always interested in that. What? You said you'll only love me! I was just talking. It was a joke! Who is it? There's no need to answer. Answer it. -It's Min-jeong. -Then you should pick up. Be quiet, okay? -Yes, hello? -Jae-hoon, baby, are you at a shoot? I'm in a meeting. Meeting? Tell me you love me. -What? -Why? You can't? I'm in a meeting. Please! I… love you… I love you too. Call me afterwards. Why did she call me at a time like this? Baby, why is he calling you baby? Do you love him that much? When he's drunk… Did you hear that? Jesus! -It's your mom. -I'm in a meeting, I'll call you later. -You're in a what? -Yes, thank you. Wait… I'm calling because-- Damn, so many calls during a meeting. Could you hug me? Aren't they past their prime? Love defies age, doesn't it? Baby. What's that? Colleagues on business trips use motels all the time. I'm so horny. Do co-workers hold hands? Love defies sexual orientation. Give me some space. -Was it good? -Of course! He must be good. Girls, come on. Let's go. What the hell? Come on. Let's go eat. He must be damn good. When should we meet again? Tomorrow? -Love defies-- -Stop it, dumbass. My back… Mi-ji, how could you knee my back? Why do you keep taking your shirt off? My body heats up all the time because I'm so full of passion. I know what this is. My friend's so into this that she doesn't even need guys. Is she Sook-hee from Majang-dong? How did you know? That damn hag… I've been wanting to try this thing out. Mi-ji… If I sit here, you should lean back. Try it. Go on. Try it. Like this. Lift your legs up. -What are you doing? -Stretch! I don't know about this. You're so flexible. Do you do Pilates? I don't think this is it. Is it like this? Does it hurt? Mom picks up the phone to call her husband when her son asks for him. The phone rings but no one answers. He must be in a meeting. He'll come right away after work. I hope he gets here before my surgery. I'm going to rush home and bring you some clothes. -Hurry back. -Okay, honey. WIFE Heavy moans trickle out to the living room. A family portrait hangs in the hallway. Honey… He wrote it many times, but didn't know what to say. What are you doing? I don't believe this… Why are you reading my script? You're a freaking asshole! You dirty bastard… What are you staring at, asshole? Dirty prick, you're always stripping down! I'm sick of you, asshole! Freaking asshole! Before she swore at me, I was utterly useless. But her profanity gave me hope to finish my script. YOU FREAKING ASSHOLE! -Sir… What's going on? -What? Should I put some music on? Turn it on. I'm sorry for ruining the mood. Not at all. Should we go clubbing? We can't die on a depressing note. Let's go have fun and die. How about it? Everyone, okay? Let's go! -That sounds good. -Sure. What do you think? What will she do? It's best she leaves now. She declined three times, so he won't think she's easy. Let's go. There she goes! Good work, guys! Freaking morons… That's the way to do it. Why are you running? I'm just so excited. I walk pretty fast. Me too. Wait for me! It looks like rain stopped just in time for clubbing. The weather's great! Wait a minute. Wasn't he pissed? -He was. -Of course not. It's a misunderstanding. To express my emotions in one word… Eureka! Eureka? What does that mean? Holy cow… You could've died alone. Are you okay? -Thank you. Let's go. -Mi-ji. Don't do that. You're making me nervous. I should have saved her. I should've saved her. I didn't realize it before… What? I think you made the right call. About what? The 30 billion won. Bad guys made dirty money doing bad things, and you used it for a good cause. Isn't that right, you generous angel? Don't call me that. Your cancer… Shouldn't you go to a hospital and get surgery-- Let's not talk about stuff like that. Every minute is precious. You wanted to go clubbing. Right. Sweetie, let's run! Are they trying to lose us? Run! Good evening, sir! Party of four? Come in! It's an awesome night! Come on! Let's go! This place is great! It's been so long! Du-seok's so excited. I've never been to a club! Mi-ji, let's go dancing. Okay, hold on. Let's all go! I'll go in a bit. Why? Let's all dance. It's a bit embarrassing. I've never danced at clubs. It'll be our last time. Who cares? It's not like anyone will make fun of you. Come on. Let's go! -Mi-ji! -What? Will you really die? Do you think I can't? You're too young and beautiful to die. Can't you reconsider? -Reconsider what? -Committing suicide. Stop it, or I'll get angry. Okay. -Mi-ji? -What now? I… have a wish. Can you… kiss me once? I've never dated anyone, I'd at least like to kiss-- What are they… Did I startle you? It looked like you were having a lot of fun. I almost have him. I can find out soon. When? I'm sure he didn't spend it. He bragged about it, and called someone for safekeeping. Who's that? I don't know yet. He'll meet him soon. I'll ask him soon. Do it right. Your life depends on it. Okay. Boss, it's the investigator. What? Get going. Hello? Ahn Sun-young of Hangang Middle School? Are you certain? Stay on her. Will that be enough? If Mi-ji can't do it by tonight, bring in the girl. He'll talk if his daughter's life is at risk. At least the two of us get to dance. Follow my lead, back and front-- Do it right! Mi-ji! Here she comes. -I have to talk to you. -Me? Thank you. I'm honored to have this one last dance. -Sweetie. -Yes? Can you reconsider? Reconsider what? Dying. What do you mean? Your daughter is still young. Thank you for your concern, but she'll do just fine. It's a scary world. A girl needs her dad… That's enough. This music is too slow. It's not my style. Wait, sweetie! Sweetie! What's with you? Will you really commit suicide? Yes, you don't need to lecture me on that. Can you reconsider? Stop it! I'll pretend I didn't hear that. But you did. Let go of me! Mi-ji! What happened between you two? Ask him. Sim-sun, what happened? I actually… asked Mi-ji to reconsider. Reconsider what? Committing suicide? Yes. You heard her sob story. I thought her decision was too impulsive. He's just being considerate. He offered some life advice. Right, Sim-sun? You skipped something. What did he leave out? -Mi-ji… -What? If she reconsi… Speak louder! If she decided to reconsider… I would… What's he saying? He said he'd take the last train to Seoul with me. -What? -Did you say that? You asshole! You asshole! How could you say that? -Hey Zhang Fei. -If you don't want to die, go home! Why try to convince her too? Du-seok, you also told me to reconsider! You damn prick! What did you say? You dumb asshole! You're no Zhang Fei! -Like hell! -You're more like Cao Cao! What the hell is Cao Cao? Asshole! Cao Cao was a backstabbing bastard! You two… I'm going to kill you, stupid little jerk! I'll break your arm! I'll shatter it! Stop it! You two are no better than each other! We're blood brothers! Screw that! He's no brother! I don't even want to associate with him! Don't pretend to be her white knight! At least I didn't talk about leaving together! Asshole! Why can't you believe me? Fine! I'll drink. Will that satisfy you? Wait! We must drink together! You fool! I really came here to die. But once she called me a freaking asshole, the wall inside my heart came crumbling down! It was… as if she released me to the outside world! I thought I could finally be me, with her by my side, I know I can write anything! I'm so sorry! I didn't want to betray you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What will you do? Will you live or die? I will die. If you're not sure, just say so. Du-seok! I already made up my mind. I want to die. Mi-ji? Me too. It's past midnight. Let's end this. I'd like to believe that you have no more regrets. Sweetie… Shouldn't you text your daughter one last time? HONEY, I LOVE YOU I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE AMUSEMENT HONEY, I LOVE YOU A daughter needs her dad. I'm a worthless dad. There's no such thing. Why are you worried about my daughter you never met? My dad passed away on my first day of middle school. I wasn't particularly close to him, but without him around, I felt a hole in my heart. Sun-young will feel the same. Did you call her Sun-young? What? Yes, your daughter Sun-young. I never mentioned her name. Who are you? What? How did you know her name? It's… Did you do a background check… Did Mr. Ma send you? My ex made a ton of money with Bitcoin. I got in on it too, and it tripled in a flash. I went nuts. I borrowed money from friends, families and even loan sharks. When I came to, it was already out of my hands. The loan sharks' interest rates were ridiculous… When I couldn't pay Ma back, I signed away my body. I was about to be sold off somewhere, but he promised me a clean slate if I found out about the 30 billion won. How did you know I was here? I think he hacked your phone. Where is Mr. Ma now? He's in a van outside the motel, waiting for my call. The real Rose of Betrayal is there too. He showed up at the club too, but I sent him away. No… But I already told you I had no money before clubbing. Why didn't you tell Mr. Ma the truth? If I can't find the money… I'm as good as dead. I thought I'd be better off dying here. Mr. Ma's tracking down Sun-young. He knows her school and which routes she takes. Contact your ex or her new dad. What? That bastard… You were all so good to me. I'm sorry for deceiving you. I'm so thankful that I got to spend time here, and I'm happy that… I can die like this. Do you think you can die happily? I will… end this. Sir… Sir? Help! What's going on? LEE MI-JI It's about damn time! Byung-nam? What a mess. Where's everyone? Sit down. Let's have a drink. Why? Do you think it's poisoned? It's not. I quit drinking thanks to you. Mr. Ma. I live and die by my intuition, and you sent an amateur. So the professional came. -Hey. -Yes, boss? How's half? Back up. Half? Chairman Shin doesn't have to know. You know where that money came from. It's not like he's going to call the police. Tell him I took off with it, that I fled the country. Let's say you bring the money back to him. Do you think he'll reward you even 10 million won? Aren't you two the same age? Why are you so loyal to him? I just don't get it. Name me one guy who ended up better off under him. Not one, right? You've gone insane. How long have we been here? It's been five minutes, boss. So what? Do we have a deal? Or let's go to the police together. What? My boys left ten minutes ago. The police should be here soon. I don't believe this… Sour worms. This has less and less effect on me. It's not sour at all. Boss, there's no time. I make the call! Me! You stand back and wait! Of course, boss. Deal. I'm a year older than him. Is that so? You made the right call. Fine, what now? -This is the address. -Address? Tell him I sent you, and you'll have it. Goddamn insane… -Another worm. -Sure. Give me one! What's with the worm? Let's do it your way. But if the money isn't there, I'll follow you to hell. -Let's go. -Wait. Once you walk out of here, we're done. We already are. -Mr. Ma. -What? Can we just be done with it? I've had it with her. I want to sell her organs or something. I heard she signed a waiver. Give me that. Give it. Don't sell her liver. It's already rotten. Let's go. ORGAN WAIVER AGREEMENT Don't kill me… Rose of Betrayal? Who are you? -I'm Incomplete Life! -I'm Grade-based Happiness! Help me. Are you okay? Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much! There. That's hot! Be careful. It's all over. Thank you. So do we really die now? Of course. Mi-ji, take the first train home. What do you mean? I won't go alone. You saved me. How could I go alone? Can't you all reconsider? We swore an oath in the face of death. The three of us will die together. Mi-ji, don't forget me. I'll have you in my heart. Shut it. You three go home. You have no reason to die. Your waiver is in ashes, Sim-sun can now finish the script, and Du-seok… You can report Chairman Shin and those thugs together. You'll get a Good Samaritan award or something. Become a policeman, Du-seok. And you? I'll be dead soon anyway. That's not right! Everyone has a reason to live. Why must you die? He's right! Don't say weak stuff like you'll die. Didn't we come together to die? Sweetie, come with us. Let's get you treated. We'll support you. We certainly will. Sir, let's all live! I LOVE YOU TOO, DAD COME TO MY RECITAL NEXT WEEK My daughter… sent three hearts. Sir… -Byung-nam… -Sweetie! Byung-nam! -Byung-nam! -Byung-nam! Joeun Pharmaceutical donated 30 billion won to Dongyang Society. The donation was meant to relieve financial burden for many cancer patients. -In a moment… -There he is! Mr. Ma from Joeun will join us to give you more details. What made you donate 30 billion won? Donate? Will you donate more in the future? One comment please! Drop your heads in front! When did I donate… When did you plan to donate 30 billion won? I didn't plan anything. So, please… What are your future plans for additional donations? Additional? Why did you decide to donate? It was very sudden. JOEUN'S 30 BILLION WON DONATION TO FIGHT CANCER You did an amazing thing. I think 30 billion won is too little. Chairman Shin rejected the idea, but I convinced him. I'll convince him to donate more for more good causes in the future. JOEUN PHARMACEUTICAL "DONATES 30 BILLION" Sachiko. That's Mr. Ma, isn't it? DONATIONS WILL CONTINUE Yes. I'll make sure you get plenty of support. Thank you! It must be done. Thank you so much! Could you strike a pose? Let's beat cancer. I'll convince the chairman to donate his entire wealth. I'll do it! I heard that you'll also donate your wealth, Mr. Ma. I have nothing so far, I'll donate when I get some. I'll donate everything. -Give us a big smile! -It looks like you're crying! I'll donate everything. Hurray!
