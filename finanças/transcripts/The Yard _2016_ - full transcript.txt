Airbag theft. This is very serious and must be dealt with. Of course you should report any damage or accident but when it comes to sabotage, it's even more important. To deal with this, we've launched a bonus system. So if you report a person committing sabotage or causing an accident you'll be paid a bonus according to criteria based on our economic loss. It's important that you can verify any claims. Ifs all in this handout. Thanks. Thank you. You can't smoke here. - Change teams. - What'? You have to change teams, okay'? - Why'? - Because I say so.
