Subject, can you continue? Is that it? They are very good results. Really good The forth one will work as long as possible Right Next subject, please Good evening, sir - Hello - What can we do for you? Well I'll try to keep to the point I've called you over, because I've been observing them I'm putting together a chronological log but I can't be everywhere at once Therefore, just so you can get your bearings Here's the laboratory, and this is a little anteroom These are the test subjects of the experiment That's how they're laid out There's one here and here There's a window here. The scientists are here Just here Just stand there and watch Bring my attention to anything of interest and I'll make a record of it Be as discreet as you can. Don't interfere That's all. Let's go Perhaps before we take this reading we should send off the second subject's brain scan Regarding your question about creating a more perfect soldier. An individual who can deal with greater physical demands for longer Yes To endure heavier loads, for a greater period of time And this is the experiment By stimulating the septal area with a specific signal Start giving orders. They made it just in time Alright, let's carry on afterwards Subject, are you ready? Am I done? You're done Actually, I'd just like some juice I don't know, perhaps some tea and chocolate? And some carbs. Feed him to the pigs. Stepanovna, here's some sugar Let me help I'll take the spoon out Grandma'll give it to you. I've made the arrangements Take your glasses off She'll give it to you. A bit of meat What else? Potatoes - Fried? - Yes Off you go Really? How come? Really? I thought there was something going on? You're married, Maksim But I'm not I know, I've been watching you You've got a complex about married men then? I just don't go round breaking up families Who's ordering food? I've already told you, or should I say it again? My surname is Chuyenkov - Sorry? - Chuyenkov It's a famous surname Only give him one toffee, he's on a diet Battered chicken We'll share it Veal? No, chicken A fillet of chicken Give him some goat's balls Fried potatoes Two lunch meat sandwiches and some tea What else did I want? Could I have some apple juice now? It's a while before the food comes Sure, help yourself The glasses are there There's not enough for a glass We'll add some more Go to the old woman or the pig-keeper Victoria I'm alive Fine We conducted an experiment And now we need... Thank you Let me make you some new ones Go on then I forgot what it was. Black bread, and? With cheese Watch out, she might spit in your tea Which bread? White? You have beer, don't you? Then I'd like some fresh beer, please - Do you have any change? - Do you have any toffee? He's on a diet He's on a diet. Don't give him any toffee That was the right move Thank you Do you have any soup or food at all? Take care I've known them a long time - Your comrades? - Yes I've known Maxim, the one with the glasses for over ten years How old are you? Twenty six. - You're young - Old age is coming If only we were 26. Fucking fed up with their parties They're doing it on purpose Let's get some fucking sedative and spike their vodka so they fall asleep. Listen Dope their vodka so they pass out, They fall asleep as normal Put a sedative in their vodka, they fall asleep then strip them and leave them in the corridor. No, what about a laxative? What about a laxative? And break the toilet? No need to break it Empty the water tank No, no, no One person shitting, and the next one's outside, hopping. Then a minute later the first one's bursting again. One shitting one hopping. Can you imagine? I still think just laxatives They're too old for sedatives, they might die. Imagine we kill the professors. "Who did it?" We're sitting here giggling, then - bam - four corpses over there. That would be embarrassing. Yes We got each other Come on Ah, you dog - I had to pull them apart from time to time - His legs get in his was Look at this This tall guy Maxim always slips What are those? They're just sticks No, no. He is making stabbing motions Yes, stabbing Hello - Hello - Hello - Good day - Hello Have a seat, comrades My name is Azhippo I am the director of the institute Recently appointed director Though I've been involved with the work here for a while I was engaged in providing state security you may have heard this already Recently, the Institute has been researching super abilities of mankind Man's abilities and super abilities Influencing these abilities Developing them and forming of these super abilities We could use the term "forming of the Superhuman" You are the group You are not here by chance There was a thorough selection process based on your individual qualities If one of you would like to tell me how you view life in contemporary society If we don't influence it radically what will become of this society? Well, I can try - and give my point of view - Please I believe that the biggest mistake of this society is the understanding of the idea of freedom At the moment freedom is misconcieved That is, anyone feels free to drink to degrade rather than develop One might work in a factory, drink in the evening In essence, he is a member of society. Yes, he works, he's got a couple of kids Does the society of today have any future if it remains unchanged? Well if it doesn't change there's no future No, absolutely no future I don't believe you should have the freedom to degenerate I mean, if someone doesn't want to develop, we have to say "Hey, what's wrong with you? Find a course to study" "Sign up to do sport" In this case it'd be better not to use legislative approach but rather use propaganda mass media, films, laws, the influence of the family, school, work... Sorry to interrupt I expected this answer from you That society is indeed degenerating Something similar is happening at the Institute That is, alcoholism, sexual immorality lack of faith in a better future Widespread overdependence on personal property This is the reality So within the experiment you're taking part in, You have to try and influence the people around you You have to create the atmosphere of tension I can list a few methods of how this could be achieved which you can develop further You might say hello to someone but think, "I'd like to chuck this scum into the furnace" The intonation must make it clear what you mean by "Hello" Do you have any questions for me? Perhaps about the work of the Institute Or perhaps your work here at the Institute Well, the first experiment I could suggest is to calculate alcohol and tobacco consumption by the members of staff and see what happens in a week's time They won't even know it's an experiment Is terror the correct way to achieve your aims? The ends justify the means So based on that you have to define certain methods So you don't deny it It depends It should be worth the trouble Terror could simply be creating an atmosphere of fear around you That's also a kind of terror Yes, there's no point in just blowing up houses or people But you can have focused terror I see I had to, as well during the war and before organise mass executions and be directly involved in the executions I had to kill people It so happened, it was necessary that is also terror Or you can understand it in its most obvious sense in blowing up buildings Perhaps that's necessary in certain situations Would you be capable of it if it were necessary? I can repeat: end justifies means It depends on the aim I see I noticed you have a wedding ring Does family interfere with this commitment? I'd say it only helps if it's a normal and healthy family If a husband loves his wife and a wife supports her husband and they have children This is the aim of a normal person improving yourself and put all the best in your children Very well Thank you Thank you for the discussion Thank you It was a pleasure. The boys will wait. They're not in a hurry "The boys" are in a big hurry I can't peel the sausage any quicker Don't peel it I have to. Are you going to eat it with the skin? You don't need to tell me, I know my job It'll burn off We can try if you like We'll do it as you like What's wrong? Give me some vodka Alright, one second Ira, dear Go out to the toilets, please Will you fry us some sausages? Not until you've given me some vodka How little the plebs need to be content Perhaps, we should send him a bottle of vodka? I thought you were dead against it? Maybe it'll kill him That's your intention? Of course No, come on You don't give treats with bad intentions There are no good intentions when you offer someone alcohol Give him a bottle of vodka I won't give it, I'll sell it. Obviously - Shall I say it's from you? - Send it straight over, yes Comrades From that table to the kitchen staff With compliments To your health, guys Thank you kindly Do you have any dried fish? - What? - Dried fish We can order some in Goodness. You always make very strange orders Can't you read? Here's the menu There we go again Canteen girl's aggression It's a characteristic feature of canteen girls It emerged three years after the first canteen opened Then it was classified Stop being such a smartarse Why? Better to act the fool We can do one at a time I noticed Or we can act like total morons What do you prefer? Relax Relax and enjoy ourselves? Of course How long does that take? Slowly or quickly? The tea? No. To relax You're asking me? Yes, I am asking How to relax quickly? No, how you like it. Quickly or..? You'll have to translate this for me He's flirting That's what they call it now I'm just not used to it It's a sociological matter How do you prefer to relax? Let's stay and watch for a moment. Athletes. Did you miss me? Yes, Vanya honey. Time keeps passing And we are getting younger. It's a shame about my fucking gut. Right, Vika? - And the rest. - That won't get in the way, Vika. I've got a gut too. God, I've put on so much weight. Do you remember how skinny I used to be? You still look pretty good to me. - Will someone marry me? - Of course, you're beautiful God save the Tsar Hold on Give me a lift No, no, no. Closer - Closer? - To me - Will it work? - I think so No, no, further if you can It's sagging Shame to alcoholics Do you know where they keep the alcohol? - In the fridge - It's on the table We need to remove it all throw it in the rubbish and chant "Shame on the alcoholics" and chant "Sport, Health, Socialism" Dump it in the bins, they can look in there Let's go Go and get it then Come on, all together I'll climb upstairs - And we will shout. Let's shout - Let's do it. Let's do it What then? Shall we go upstairs straight away? Shall I heat it up? - I've taken everything - There's some more here Yes Shame on the alcoholics Shame on the alcoholics Sport, Health, Socialism Sport, Health, Socialism Sport, Health, Socialism Shame on the alcoholics Shame on the alcoholics Shame on the alcoholics Shame on the alcoholics Shame on the alcoholics Sport, Health, Socialism Sport, Health, Socialism Sport, Health, Socialism She is going for the exercise machines. She's got bottles. - Break the weights with the bottles - Go on. Go on Alcohol versus sport. Alcohol versus sport. Alcohol versus sport. Hit them harder. No, she's exercising, let's clap. Well done, Olga. If our methods had an impact on you we appreciate it. These guys can provoke unrest abroad. Did they pour it over you? No, she did it herself I'll get you again What was that? I flipped it and and hit your sides You were going to grab the blade? My hand isn't as vital as your liver Finish him with your forehead You missed two hits You could knock him down Who? When you were fighting with the knives Ah, well If I could fight better and never miss I'd be a coach Use your elbow He won't be able to kill you We're closing Vasya, why are you bothering the young man? Don't worry, he's not a girl Why are you bothering our customers? Very well I apologize Vika Give me another bottle of vodka How are you? Again with the cigarette Cigarettes? You smoked today I didn't I just made a small ashtray-bonfire out for three packs of cigarettes And blew on it Did you inhale? It smoked out the entire room and D1 What for? Just because All these smokers think it's fine to make somewhere smokey but when I do it, suddenly they're all nervous It's suddenly all "Who is smoking?" "Yuck, yuck. What a nightmare" Why'd you do it? I wanted to turn them out Turn them out or turn them on? "What's that smell? What's going on?" Something like that Can we have some coffee? You want coffee? Fine Do you really have to torment me? Let's make a bonfire out of cigarettes here too and smoke the place out And breath it all in? Yes So, a big cup? Yes Good evening. Canteen I like that kind of phonecall What? I like phonecalls when no one wants anything from me It's been freezing the whole day How are your comrade scientists? They are very friendly I said that I promised Nobody would put salt in your vodka Pixies Nobody would pee in the cider Nobody would do any harm I think they were really surprised by what happened to the cider How did you do it? You opened them and...? No. They just didn't close their unfinished bottles And left them on the table, out in the open Did they drink them? Of course they did What don't they drink? We told them not to You know how it is here Obviously, I don't know who it was It obviously wasn't me But someone in the night got to those bottles So there will be no more of that We get on fine now Will I get red lips? Yes I did it on purpose Are we both going to slobber on each other? You look like a clown. Me too, right? Is my nose red as well? Fuck, you do look like a clown Let's look in the mirror Kiss my nose It didn't work, hold on I think we're beautiful Wait Alina, dear Some black tea Made it for you What's going on? They are sitting there talking I cannot catch the same wave with them, I fail to do this It just makes me sad Why? I don't know I don't care, to be honest, nobody does Whether anything happens? Drink your tea - What? - What's that? It's green tea Fucking hell Have you tried it? It's evidently some kind of booze It's green tea Got it Sorry, everything is against your rules I drink, I smoke And you're degenerating It seems like all the scientists have run away from you I don't know why? You're wonderful - Really? - Of course You know, a wolf seems wonderful to a she-wolf but not to a hare I feel sort of sorry for them Why? I don't know. They've become such pitiful creatures How? They always keep quiet, and don't say much As though they aren't thinking of anything Were they playing jokes before? They played the fool To be honest they didn't behave as well as you guys can They're supposed to be the intelligentsia All that intelligentsia stuff is rubbish They read a lot of books, then what? They're suddenly intelligentsia? When I was in prison, I tried to pass myself off as an intellectual It's easier that way Because, if you're intellectual You know elegant words, and so on No one asks you dumb questions, like "What do you do for a living?" Because as you start to answer He doesn't understand I was talking to the mafia boss there I could see it was as though he was listening But he couldn't grasp it He feels stupid, but it's easier for him to say "Ah, alright. I get you" "I'll chat to you later" Is that what you did? That's what you did? Almost always. It's just easier On the one hand On the other hand, if required, I can bare my teeth Most of these people can't do anything They'll just hit you a few times, that's their limit That's not your limit? No Two people are talking, one of them might just hit the other, but the other might slit his throat As they talk, the first can see "I might hit him but I won't go further" "but this one can" I find all this nonsense funny "Could you kill someone?" What kind of a fucking question is that? Who the fuck would you have to be to ask a question like that? How could you not possibly kill a person? How could you not? Who ever asked a soldier at war "Are you able to kill a person?" And they're so shocked "How could you?" But there are different motives But it's a specific question. Could you or not? You could Anyone could People have asked me that question a lot recently But they haven't worded it correctly They should ask "What would you kill for?" Or "under what conditions"? Listen, I don't want to discuss this now I want to relax You want to relax? Come here then What? I'm waiting for you to show your strength Harder I just can't reach you What then? Come on then Sorry Is that uncomfortable? Just give me a second I don't feel anything Wait, I'll help Sit What happened? What? Grip it harder Show me your strength Faster Harder, harder Bend down Bend down That's it Yes You animal You're all wet You don't have to go jogging now You animal I'm an animal? You are You're an animal As well as a little boy That I want to hug What's wrong? All people are animals but I'm lucky to be a little boy Life is boring without being a little boy at heart Yes You understand? To and from work Home again Read the newspaper Chat shit in the kitchen Fight with your wife then bed. That's it Life's over When I was small, I thought "I become a grown up and what?" Who would I become? Have a boring life? Adults never laugh Only when they're drunk I never wanted to be drunk You saw too much of it? Not really Why did you make that decision? I think you just decided My mother doesn't drink So maybe to keep her company Did your mother love you when you were small? - Did she show you lots of love? - Yes Enough You weren't deprived? I had a nice childhood I had a mother and father, grandmothers I really had a wonderful childhood I had a grandfather who spent a lot of time with me He taught me to draw to do wood carving we backpacked So many people think I grew up like that In essence, the fact that I'm quite aggressive and angry I must have had an unhappy childhood A cruel fate, perhaps A broken family Nope Why did you kill people? Why do people kill each other in wars? Orders Duty For their country Do you know what's interesting? When a person kills on command it's seen as normal He's ordered to, so he kills. It's his national duty But when a person decides independently who to kill I don't mean maniacs or robbers who kill for money I mean people who kill for an idea They could be called terrorists Madmen But more often they are called terrorists These are people, who have used their brains You have to think beforehand then act You see? "Alright fine, alright it's done" And the sense of a duty is fulfilled And you're satisfied Duty to whom? Duty to your conscience All of these crimes are determined by your conscience What does your conscience command? My conscience orders me to do all I can to make the world better to create the ideal society That's it So, I don't know Is there any official hierarchy in your group? Though it more or less makes itself some people are higher, some are lower Some obey others. That's normal in any society even in such small groups It's always the case So this is what I think I enjoy discussing things with you but it won't always be convenient to call you all to my office I wouldn't want everyone here to know I don't want to advertise that using you not I, but we intend to make some changes to this community I was interested to know whether each of you would be able to use extreme methods in order to achieve our goal Yes, it might mean terror, of the most ruthless kind Destruction Inflicting bodily harm and maybe taking someone's life, which means murder Let's call it by its name I doubt that every one of your comrades is ready for that I guess you've noticed my doubts And my question about family wasn't just random It's definitely his weak point And his argument wasn't very convincing I agree I heard in passing, perhaps I'm mistaken that you have your own particular unique ideas about family, and gender relations Perhaps not unique, but different from what's accepted The fact is that I don't just think critically I'm also quite cynical That's good Being cynical is a healthy attitude of fighting hypocrisy, in essence That's on the one hand On the other hand I see that any husband unfaithful to his wife or guy that cheats on his girlfriend or wife on her husband All of that sooner or later will become detached Therefore I won't enter into the bonds of wedlock with anyone That's firstly Secondly I might not be the only one but actually I believe that most males are polygamous I mean they want to mate with as many females as possible There's the war of the sexes, as well as other things It doesn't stand in my way at all I'd say it actually helps Maxim said that family fortifies him I don't believe that. It's a noose to hang yourself with Nothing can hang me. I have nothing I see Maxim, I have one more request I think it's right I contact you I will find a way to do that and then we will discuss the details and I will tell you my expectations and you will tell me how realistic they are Well, and how you'll make them come true Deal? Excellent Thank you Goodbye Are they testing? - Good evening - Good evening Is it going well? Training is underway No competitions yet, so... He dodged it He didn't keep his balance Let's go, and leave them be Marina Will you excuse us, please? Let's sit - Would you like some tea? - No, thanks It's a serious matter Regarding our guys All together... Our men of action? Yes Our men of action We have to discuss them a bit In my opinion, they are more or less ready to act They should be given the last strategic objectives But that's my job It's a start for them It is a future for them. For them it's It's a beautiful beginning for them. A reliable springboard And for us it's a good way to leave I tell you what After we get through this When it's all over I would like to retire I'm tired - Of course - And to start something new - I don't have the strength anymore - Right, look What stands before us will mark a good end to your service I want to conclude everything nicely I will not let you down, I will do my best But once this is all over, I'd really like to leave Well, a staff pension already awaits So, of course you can go What will you do in retirement? Or haven't you decided? Who knows. I think I'll just rest for half a year Well, of course Lie around on the sofa with a book, rest What about fishing and travelling? I want to return home to Crimea I'd certainly like to go to Crimea I'm planning to buy an apartment there I see - I should have enough money - I'm sure Perhaps with some cooperative Bit by bit I'll get settled. Or I'll find a house Actually, a house is even better A house would be much better. In Yalta, perhaps Go out in my swimming trunks In Sevastopol or any other big city... Of course, a house would be better A little boat It'll be nice I'll be able to relax properly I don't know how much longer I have left But I think I should last another ten years I'll come visit Please do Vika, are my fried potatos on the way? - My fried potatoes? - Maxim, stop - Your fried potatoes? - Yes Fried potatoes with what? Just fried potatoes Cheese croquettes Give me one to try We're being good Komsomol here and what are you like? Comrades The revolution awaits Take the croquettes with you Thank you, we're full Let's steal all the forks too. Wait, I'm taking my food with me Think about it Or don't you want to? What? I can't hear you Don't you want to go to D-1? What for? You know what for Let's go Come here Ira, I'll just be a second Listen There's no "us" There's nothing between us either Alright Therefore Not interested? It was just unnecessary If you say so See you How long before the pancakes are ready? What's the plan of action? To pig out Can't find my badge Maxim's not wearing his cap What of it? Here's Maxim in a lovely suit Discussing the latest trends in youth fashion? Fucking hell Hello Here's a present from our team We would like to take a piggy paint slogans on it denunciatory ones, and take it to the residential building It's not easy to take them out We'll just lift one out We're strong guys I've had enough of you I can't listen to this Get the bucket on its snout - Go on - Drag it upstairs Grab it Go on. Go on It thinks there's a wall there I think so I can't stand when it screams Go on, go. Move it, move it Hold the sack like the pig-keeper is doing And walk beside it What are you giving out commands for? You take it Move it, move it - Have you got it? - Yes A bit more, for fuck's sake Move it, move it, move it I'm holding it It's grunting Quickly, put it on - Here - Thank you very much What brings you? Vladimir Arkadevich, I'm sorry to take such a liberty But I need your advice I am listening It is difficult to speak Something has happened Our communists, the athletes The young guys? Yes Essentially Even I don't know what's happening to me I'm completely lost You're not in love, are you? No? I don't know I think you might be I don't know what to do Tell me I've become such a sap What are you here to discuss? I came to talk about Maxim Comrade Martsinkevich What about him? He is a lovely boy If you like him I can't say I share your romantic feelings for him But I like him too, he's a good guy A decent young man How close are you? Are you sleeping with him? Of course "Of course" she says I'll be honest If you... You sleep with a man It means he trusts you completely, right? He tells you everything What and how he's doing What his future plans are If he's serious about you he's including you in this future, right? You're right, in theory We talked about it The thing is, I can't say that... Yes, I want stability. I want a family But I know it won't be with him If you know that already, then to hell with him Why do you need him? You'll lose a piece of your heart and waste it on nothing It's just the first time in a few years that something real has awakened inside me I can see why I don't want to lose it I was so empty before I met Maxim This boy I don't know what's wrong with him But he really needs affection and love I can tell that he doesn't like himself We even talked about it. He said so himself He said he hates himself "I have no pity for myself" So how can he feel pity? - Towards others? - Yes I think he's just a young communist A young communist. That would explain it If all our workers were like Maxim I'm telling you Tomorrow I would request a retirement I'd go with total peace of mind I'm not kidding I honestly wish everyone was a bit more like Maxim He's got a sharp mind His heart beats strong He considers all his actions He knows what he'll achieve tomorrow in a month's time, in a year He plans it and does it It's marvellous Don't think about how bad you're feeling Just think that you're together and it feels good and that only good things lie ahead Love is a feeling that really causes euphoria How can euphoria be a bad thing? It can only be good So you're saying I just shouldn't think about it? You mustn't think. You have to aspire to live and live well Go around enjoying yourself, have fun Hold hands I think it will all be fine We've got onions, sour cream some mineral water Why don't you ask Ivan? I'm doubt you can make shashlik Will you ask him? I don't want to It's not a woman's job. It's best if you ask Go ask Ivan We'll make half using his recipe He likes his food He likes his food alright Cut off one of the front legs and we'll eat it tomorrow Vasily already butchered it We'll butcher Vasily if he isn't careful No one would say it's blood though Show Ira It isn't blood - Looks nice - It's lipstick marks Another one Looks nothing like it, you liar We can stop here. I just wanted to have a chat Let's go, I have a key to one of the labs I'd rather not Come on, let's go Let me say something My conscience is tormenting me The... Your conscience is tormenting you? That makes me want to run away You want to run away? This has been against my rules for a long time But for some reason, I think that Basically Please forgive me for telling you to get lost yesterday The last thing I wanted was was to hurt you, if I did Did I hurt you? I just decided I wanted a clean break That was the best way you could have put it The best way? From a logical point of view, yes So you understand Of course Please forgive me I'm just scared Of me? I'm scared of myself But at least now I know I'm alive What else do you need? You know you're alive Did you ever doubt it? That I'm alive? Do you ever find yourself going to work like a robot? Maxim I've been going to work like that for about ten years now Maybe it's... maybe it's worth it And maybe the risk of feeling pain is worth feeling alive for a few moments Animal Stop it I'm still at work But you can drink wine on the job, can you? What? Can you smell it? Stop it, you No, I sniffed your glass It was apple juice Apple juice, right? My sweetheart Maybe tonight or tomorrow you'll decide it's not worth it spending time with me That it's just too much too painful and unpleasant I know that already Not just me, but you too It could really hurt you Do it like that My boy Do you want me to come to you tonight? We'll sleep in each other's arms Like a couple in love I'll give you all my tenderness. Agreed? - Will you come? - What? Will you come? Do you want me to? Yes Alright Fuck knows what'll happen next Fuck it. Let's agree that we don't give a fuck Yes? Yes Hello Come in, Maxim Take off your coat and have a seat How's life? Not too bad The scientists don't want to change They don't. They're resisting Although, there have been some positive results There has been immense resistance You've confronted them, using rather creative, interesting methods Posters The Komsomol way It was good. I observed it with great pleasure You are thinking in the right way By and large, you completed the task I don't think I could have done it better You always walk a fine line I was worried since you live with these people you might start to form personal relationships to empathize with certain people and show unacceptable kindness Thankfully, everything is moving along well escalating even And all your actions were straight and true This is all great, it's good Except it's a bit childish, a warm up of sorts The issue is much more serious As you now know that this Institute is a cesspit a den of lust This superficial decency this politeness their love of novels their love for discussing the topics of the day their scientific discussions their smoking, drinking and so on In reality, they're drunkards, alcoholics There's nothing sacred about them including in their daily lives These are all just formal relationships which they keep up between each other In the reality they are all rotten Completely rotten They'll never get better Whether you get rid of the vodka or write the banners They'll never get better Now listen carefully Regarding this Institute the decision has been made at the very top that this establishment, this Institute, should no longer exist At all Nothing must remain No rooms No documents No equipment No devices And most importantly the entire workforce has to be liquidated Everyone has to be liquidated You have to do it Your group will be enlarged up to 30 people This number will be quite sufficient The security guards will be removed from here No guards will remain. They will go off for training For you and your group it is a very big honour It is a platform from which you can make a start At some point we won't be around any more But you will be left And in a few decades, it will be you that has to build a sober, healthy society armed with ideas ideas that the society loves and with which it can go forward Onwards and upwards Don't be shy, ask This is the final decision? No one can be left alive? No one Alas, this is the case, show no mercy Not to women or the elderly It must be done It must be All of the weak have to be destroyed Whether we like them or not they mustn't exist We can't draw a line and say these are good and these aren't these ones are weak and these ones are useful Some of them might have been In this case, they are all useless They're a waste of space They're trash They cannot exist When? Very soon Fucking thing Lie closer I want to hold you Come here, darling I want you to lie here, I want to feel you - I'd crush you - No Please, I want to feel you here It's true Right. Here we go - Is there anyone in the back? - No. Put him in Right - Wait a second - Come on Help us, would you. Throw him in there Get on with it Fucking shove them in deeper Come on, let's move it Give him a hand or he'll fall What's left? Special department? Special department, two labs So, small lab We'll need a car at the special department Canteen's done That's it, you checked it? I'll check D1 - Everything good there? - Yes, all is well. Great Let's move the car here, it'll be easier
