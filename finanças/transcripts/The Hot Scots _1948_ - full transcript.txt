[♪] Pardon, inspector. There are three chaps outside insisting upon an interview. Very well, Dawson. Show them in. Yes, sir. [ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, well. Good morning. STOOGES: Good morning. And what can I do for you gentlemen? Oh, before we answer that, I wanna prove we're not gentlemen. Ow! Ooh! Give me my lip, will you? Ah! Fooled you, didn't we? I say, that's amazing. Now, if you don't mind explaining... We're first-class detectives, inspector. We came to answer your ad. Ad? Yes. Here it is. "Wanted, experienced yardmen. Apply, Inspector McCormick. Scotland Yard." That's you, isn't it? Yes, but I'm afraid you don't understand. [ALL MUMBLING] Recede. A-1 Correspondent School of Detectin'. Oh, yes. Mail-order detectives. I'll give you your chance. STOOGES: Oh, boy! Your assignment is to locate some missing papers. ALL: Missing papers! We must locate the missing papers! Locate missing papers. Fine detectives we turn out to be. This is humiliatin'! BOTH: Oh! Quit squawking, you guys. Don't you know if we do a good job they might promote us to be detectives. Now, carry on. Get busy! Oh! Ow, ow, ow! Ooh! Oh! Oh! I didn't mean it, Moe. All right, take it easy, son. I just want to ask you a question. What would you rather have, a shoe full of dollar bills or two socks of five? I'll take the two socks. You got 'em. Oh! Eh! Cheatin' eh? Now, get to work on the square. You two, get up here and get to work. Wait a minute, what are you gonna do? Yeah, what are you gonna do? Nothin', what about it? Oh, just go like this. Oh! Get outta here. Now we got a system. We'll have this place spick-and-span in nothing flat. There's another one. Now you guys are really working. Shut up and get busy. Trim that hedge. Well, I guess that's it. Wait a minute. What's that? Hey, you nitwit. We're in a hurry. Use the big clippers. I'll see that Inspector McCormick gets the message, thank you. If there's anymore paper in this yard, I'll eat it. Here comes your lunch. Hey, Shemp. Hey, Larry! Come here. Look at this. "Three operatives, report to Glenheather Castle at once. "Sixty miles northwest of Glasgow. Must be Scotch. Instructions on arrival." Oh, boy. An assignment. Yeah, but "must be Scotch." Halt, man. Halt, man. Through these veins flows some of the finest Scotch in the world. I told you we'd get promoted if we did a good job. Look at the place. Clean as a whistle! So let's blow. Not bad. Not good. Get the bag. Get the bag. Get the-- Hey, fellas. Wait for me! Wait for me! Look at the size of this shack. [SHOUTING] Train on track four. All aboard. What's the matter with you? This is a castle, you nitwit. Say, they say there's a lot of ghosts in castles. That's a lot of baloney. There's nothin' in here to be scared of. STOOGES: Agh! [IN SCOTTISH ACCENT] The earl will see you now. This way, please. Hey, Moe. Is my slip showing? No, go on. Go on, go on. Come in, lads, come in. Well, well, so you're true Scotsman, are ye? Hoot, man, hoot, man. [SPEAKING IN JIBBERISH] And today too. Meet McLarry, McShemp, and I'm McMoe. SHEMP: Hiya, mac. LARRY: Hiya, mac. MOE: Glad to mac-meet you. Lads, my secretary. Nice to know you, laddies. A charming bit of thistle down, if I do say so myself. Aye. LARRY: And what might your name be, lass? Perhaps you've heard it. 'Tis Lorna Doone. Hi, Lorna. How you doin'? Ow. You must be a bit weary after your long journey. Aye. Aye. Aye-yi-yi. Would you like a wee snifter, there? Hoot, man! That we would. That we would. Yowsa, that's what the man said. He said "yowsa". Say, what part of Scotland are you from? He's from southern Scotland. Below the McMason-McDixon Line. McYowsa. That's what-- MacPherson, the scotch broth. MacPHERSON: Yes, milord. Here it is, my lads. The very best. Good health to you. Ahh. SHEMP: When he said snifter, he wasn't kidding. Have another? No thanks, I gotta drive. MacPherson, lock it up again. That's 150 years old. With a little luck, it should get to be 250. MacPherson, fetch me the rest of my correspondents. Yes, milord. Aye. And now, lads, I'll tell you why I sent for you. I want you to guard my valuables tonight, for I'm off to a gatherin' of the clans. Oh, a clan bake, eh? Oh! You got nothin' to worry about, earl. Say, earl, there's no ghosts here, is there? No, 'tis only a rumor. That's a foolish thought. The taxi is waiting, your lordship. One moment, I have some instructions for these lads. Beg pardon, sir, but it's tuppence a minute for waiting time. Taxi! You'll find this very comfortable when the cold, clammy wind howls over the moors like a lost soul. Good night. Good night. Pleasant dreams. Oh, if you want anything, just wail, hm? [SHIVERING] Like a lost soul. Say, fellas. I ain't tired anymore. Maybe one of you guys ought to turn in. Come on, get in the bed. You grab some shuteye while Shemp and I go downstairs and look around. Come on. Wait a minute, no. I feel kind of edgy myself. I ought to take something for my nerves. Like what? A trip home. Come on, get going. But, wait a minute, I am nervous. Well, if you're so nervous, grab that gun. Hurry up. Oh! Oh, oh, I didn't mean it, Moe. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. [GROANING] Next time, be more careful. Oh, gosh, I hope nothin' happens. What kind of talk is that? What could happen? Go ahead, tell me, what could happen? Nothin', I guess. Well, then, go ahead, go ahead. [DOOR CREAKING] I'd like to see anybody get something out of here. There's not a chance with us around. [DOOR CREAKING] [LOUD BANG] Hey, fellas, cut out that racket, will you, please? Yai! [MUFFLED SCREAMING] Nice-looking shaving mug. What do you think it's worth? My uncle had a thing like that once. Poor, old Uncle Titus. He's gone now. Hard-headed old rascal. I'll never forget the first time-- Hello, unc-- Ah! Oh, what hit me? What happened? Was I dreamin'? Oh, a lump. What a dream. Uh-oh. Wrong door. Larry, there's somethin' going on downstairs. I'm glad I'm up here where it's safe. Ha-ha. This little marble will come in handy. [YELLS] Hello. Oh, hello. I thought you might be a wee bit lonesome, so I brought some cookies. You like cookies? Well, that I do. Especially blond ones. How about you and me makin' with the conversation? Aye. Oh, me too. You too? Aye. That ought to take care of any visitors. Move over. Look what you did to the covers. Quit hoggin' the blankets, will ya? You want me to catch cold? Say, you ought to see a dentist. Why don't you get to sleep? Ahh! [YELLING] Din 'ee a'kin the Highland fling? Aye. 'Tis a rumble with kilts. [CHUCKLES] [BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYING OVER RECORD PLAYER] [MUFFLED] Hey, fellas, open the door, please. It's Larry. Ah! Hey, I got the knick-knacks. 'Em in there. The guy with the big teeth took 'em. Ah, you're crazy. He's right-- Somebody stole our bed! [BAGPIPE MUSIC CONTINUES] Ah, you're a wonderful dancer! [YELLING] Operator, get me the police and get-- Ah! Hurry up, open that door. [YELLING] Oww! Whoa-oh! Ohh! Oh, I'll fix him. Get away from that door or I'll shoot. Get away! It's him again! Come here. Oh! Oh. We got him. [BOTH GASP] I'm sorry, Moe. We didn't mean it! You dough-heads. Ooh! Oh. [BANGING] [YELLING] Ah! [GROWLING] Good one, Larry. Attaboy. [BOTH YELLING] Hey! Hey, what happened? Hey, hey. [MUTTERING INCOHERENTLY] I got him. [BOTH GROAN] Angus! MacPherson! You looked better with it on. The dame with the swag, get her! [GASPS] Let me go! Let me go! Lorna, what's going on here? No! My antiques, my treasures! Hey! We got the other two crooks upstairs! Yeah, Angus and MacPherson been cleanin' out the place. The room on the right, officer. So that's what you've been doing, Lorna. Officer, take her away. Lads, I'm a grateful man, and it is only fitting that I reward ye. Aw, that ain't necessary-- But I will! Come on. The scotch broth, lads. And this time we'll really drink it, for you proved there are no ghosts in Glenheather Castle. [BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL YELLING] [GLASS BREAKING] [♪]
