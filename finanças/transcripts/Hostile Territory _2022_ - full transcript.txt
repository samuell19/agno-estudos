By the end of our nation's great Civil War, thousands of children found themselves orphaned, their fathers killed in battle, their mothers taken by disease, or grief. Many ended up on the Orphan Train, a program to relocate children from the decimated northern cities to families in other territories. Families with love to give. and farms to run. My brother, sister and I rode the Orphan Train, cold, hungry, and scared. Little did we know at the time that the only thing stronger than death was our father's love for his children. I'll miss you, Daddy. I'll miss you too. This is a doll. for both you girls. that's gonna protect you while I'm gone. And anytime you miss Daddy, you can hold that doll when you go to sleep at night, and know that I'm always thinkin' about you. Okay? Come here, Lily. Oh, I love you. When Father started talking about leaving for the war, our oldest brother, Phillip, was determined to go with him. Charlie, you're the man of the house now. Father told him to stay and look after us, but eventually relented. - Bye. - Bye. I'll be home soon. Phillip! Phillip! Father. Where are you hurt? I can't feel my legs. Come on, I got you. Get in the back. Get him to safety; get him to safety. Lieutenant! Get him down here. Get him down. Move down. They're comin', they're comin'. Move in! There's more of 'em comin', there's more of 'em comin'. I'm fine. I can go back. - No, you're not goin' back. - I can go back. You can't go back! - Charlie. - Yes, sir. - I can't leave them, Father. - Stay with me. - I love you. - No! Father, no! - Father, no! - Stay with me. - Stay with me. - No! Corporal, stay with me. All aboard! Thank you. Let's get these children on the train. We leave in five minutes. Mother got word that Father had died in battle. It was like part of her broke. like she had a hole inside. Before too long, tuberculosis came and aimed to fill it. Watch your step. Riding on that train, though, we felt a little less lonely. Next to the rest of the orphan children, we considered ourselves lucky. At least we had each other, least we were still part of a family. So, how'd you end up on this Orphan Train? My father, he didn't come back from the war. And. and my mother, she recently died. So, we're gonna live with my brother, Phil. Order! Arms! Manhood comes sooner for some. Why don't you follow me down to the Children's Aid Society. We told them you were alive, and I think your siblings should be here soon. - Take care. - Yes, sir. Son, you'll be all right. Carry on. Thank you. Um-hmm. Corporal, the Army is movin' your post. There's a lot of folks moving out west and they wanna relocate your post to one along the Bozeman Trail. Government's gonna give you land, aid, so you can build a home on the river just outside of Bozeman. Hmm. Son, that's a lot to take in. You understand what I'm sayin'? I think this could be a real good start for you and your family. Yes, sir. I do. My apologies. It'll be a good beginning. I hope it is. Thank you. There's a couple of angry tribes out there, son. And I can't blame 'em. Settlements have moved west rather quickly and things have gotten messy. We need good soldiers like yourself to. help bring some peace. Okay. Just give me a minute to gather myself. Oh, I... And then we can go upstairs. I don't. I don't want anything from you. I just. Uh, I like to. I'd like to buy this lady a drink. Are you, uh, you all right? Yes. You can come in. Um. Four years ago, I had to put my baby on the Orphan Train. Just wonder what she's like now. I want her bed to be ready just in case she does come back. We can talk about it if... if you'd like to. Ain't no man ever wanted to stay up all night and talk to me. What was, uh. what's your daughter's name? Gretyl. I named her after my mother. I wanted her to have a better life than I could give her. What will you do now the war's over? Um. I. I lost. both my parents. So, I have to be taking care of my little siblings now. The Army's relocated me up to Montana, so. Your siblings, what's their names? So, my younger brother, his name is Charlie. And, uh, so proud of that little guy. He's. he's gonna be a big man someday, you know. Reminds me a lot of my father. And, uh, gosh. Lizzy. a little ball of fire. And then Lily, kind of afraid that she won't remember me. And the thing that I can't stop thinkin' about is how am I gonna. how am I gonna break it to them, you know, Father, he's gone. And it's just gonna be me. And how am I gonna be him? Um, maybe I could walk you to the train station tomorrow, Mister... what's your name again? Uh, Phillip. Phillip Calgrove. Thank you for just wanting to talk to me. Yeah. You're welcome. What's the matter, sweetheart? I miss my mom and dad. I'm so sorry. Why does God let bad things happen? I don't have any answer to that, but we have to have faith. I want you to try to get some sleep. It's a long train ride. My mom would always sing me to sleep. ♪ O Lord my God When I in awesome wonder ♪ ♪ Consider all the works Thy Hands hath made ♪ ♪ I see the stars I hear the roaring thunder ♪ ♪ Thy powers throughout The universe displayed ♪ ♪ Then sings my soul, My Savior God to Thee ♪ ♪ How great Thou art ♪ ♪ How great Thou art ♪ Come on. Get up. War's over. Move, boy! Keep walkin'. Come on. Go on, get. Keep walkin', Desmond. Keep walking. Go. Don't look back. Come on, Desmond. Whoa. Jack Calgrove. Samuel Hagan. Boys look like you had it rough. Yeah. Desmond Richards. Samuel Hagan. I got these horses here. Strays I picked up off the battlefield. How you boys gettin' home? Molly! Charlie! I'm home! Molly? Nobody's home. Everything all right, Mr. Calgrove? Molly! Whoa, whoa. Molly. They think I'm dead. I gotta find my children. Gentlemen, allow me to welcome you home on behalf of our great nation, and know that while you have lost comrades, brothers, and friends, that it was not in vain. That your nation thanks you. Well, I'll be damned. Company, present arms! Several days after Molly had heard of your death, she passed, Jack. Tuberculosis. I'm sorry. Molly's wish was that the young ones be sent to live with your son Phillip in Missouri. Phil is still alive? Yes. Thank you, God. Who's been tendin' to Charlie, Lizzy, and Lily? The Army contacted an orphanage in New York. A gentleman by the name of Edward Pagan. He's doin' many fine works, placing children with good homes. The Orphan Train movement. You mean to tell me, you put my children in an orphanage? Jack, when I found out Phillip was still alive, I needed to get those children to Missouri to meet him. There's 50 kids on that train. It seemed to me to be the most reasonable option to transport them. Oh, help me God. You put my kids on a train, you sent them to Missouri? You realize how dangerous that is?! That's hostile territory! We just finished fightin' the war right where that train's goin'! Are there armed officers on that train? Yes, Jack. The government has ordered that Company K ride with the Orphan Trains to guard them against hostile Confederates and Natives. Company K's a group of sharpshootin' Natives from Michigan. I was in the 54th Regiment and I did some work with Company K. Jack, I can send a message through Company K alerting your son Phillip that you're still alive. I reckon you point me in the direction of that train. God bless your soul. All packed up. You know you don't have to go with me. You might enjoy some peace and quiet. Yeah. I ain't got nowhere else I got to be. And I want to help you get your family back. You're a good man. Let's get on the trail. Let's ride. Charlie, I'm hungry. Okay, um, wait right here. Um, excuse me. Would it be okay if I get a few more pieces of bread and water? Yes, dear. Um. I'll go ahead and distribute the bread to everyone. Thank you. What happened to you? Mom not want you anymore? Or she just work at one of them whorehouses? Here, you come sit with us. - Charlie, you good? - Yeah. Some bread for you. Thank you. Here. Good morning to you all! Good morning. Beautiful day for some new families. Fathers mothers, brothers, and sisters. thank you for comin'. We've arrived in Independence, Missouri, and you're all about to go home. Please stay seated for right now, and Mr. Smith will be right on to tell you where to go next. You'll have to fill out the paperwork for this gentleman. It's required by law. Those of you who've already filled out the paperwork can just step to the front of the line over there. We'll bring out the children. I need some strong boys for helping me. It's gonna be okay. Oh, we got strong ones and... and strong girls too. Do they have names? Oh yeah, they all have names. Everyone, get off the train. Follow me and we'll form a line. Watch your step. Step right down. There you go. There you go, Jimmy. There we go. Please form a line at the stand. There we go, little one. Got it, young lady? There you go. Phil! Lizzy! Phil! It's okay. Watch your step. Hey, buddy. Oh, my gosh. Look how big you've grown. Dang. Hey. Hey, uh, Lily, I... I know you may not remember me. Uh, but I'm your older brother, Phil. I'm gonna take care of you. Okay? She hasn't talked since Mother and Father died. Okay. That's all your stuff right there? - Yeah. - All right, I'll get that... Sir, you will need, uh, to fill out the proper paperwork. Okay. All right, you guys get in line. I'll be right back. Okay. Ingrid? All right, parents, step up to the front. We'll need your paperwork. Come on up. Come on up. Don't be afraid. Thank you. This way, please. Uh-uh. Step this way. Thank you. Thank you, sir. This way, please. Paperwork looks good to me. Next group. What's your name? Emily. Hi, Emily. Welcome to our family. Next. In our house, you earn your keep. You work hard, get rewarded with a good supper. If you don't work hard, you hit the road. In this house, I'm the law. That understood? Yes, sir. - Is that understood? - Yes, sir. All right. Come on. Come on down this way. Right around. Come on now. Come on. For Charlie, Lizzy, and Lily Calgrove, please. That's my brother, Phil. Phil, can we take Mary with us? I'm so... I'm sorry, children. I have, uh, Addison, Mary, Johnny, Ray and Jacob down as all getting adopted by the Smith family and they... they've not shown up yet. If they don't show up by tomorrow morning, you'll go back on the train. But... but tonight you'll sleep in the local orphanage. Wait, what about Jimmy? Uh. well, the family didn't take Jimmy. Uh, lots of times, they don't take the older children. Bye. My dad gave me this doll. I'd like you to have it. Bye. All right, uh, Lily, Lizzy, Charlie, it's time to get goin'. Here. I got this for ya. Go on, sweetheart. Bye. You're one brave cowboy. And sometimes, cowboys have to part ways to their cattle. All right, bud. I beg you, please help me. My daughter has been taken. Please. You lost? Ain't much around here but men returnin' home from the war. And for a Black woman, it ain't a safe place to be. There's a town. about 25 miles back the way we came. - Thank you. - I'm sure there's someone there can help you. Keep the guns down. Looks like we got a couple of no-good Yanks. Yankees. War's over. You guys keep on movin'. Over when we say it's over. How 'bout I just rip you off that horse? Keep goin'. We gotta keep moving. I want to rip their throats out just as bad as you do. One more step, she's done! She's done! One more step...! Come with us. Your daughter. was in an alley living out of a cardboard box. You gave us no choice but to remove her. Don't you tell me that! You don't know what I've been through to find freedom! Now to have my child ripped away! You tell me what my child is right now! Right now! Please, I beg you, sir. I beg you, please. She ain't ever been without me. I'm a good mother. I promise, I'm a good mother. I promise. I'm a good mom. Forgive me. Now, let's see what we can do for you. Looks like Mary is on a train heading to Missouri with about 40 other children. She will be at the orphanage, in good care. You sure your daughter's on that Orphan Train? I lost two years of my life in those Confederate camps. My babies' voices echoed through my head every day. It's what kept me from dyin'. How old is your daughter? She's 10. You said her name was? - Mary. - Mary? Mary Beggs. Mary. Where are you headed off to? Told you that you can't get emotionally involved with these men who come in here. They aren't safe. I never wanted this life. Do you think any of us want this life? I hate myself for bringing you here with me and Jimmy. When he died, I thought I could work here until I found another man or... or got me an honest job to take care of you. I never intended to drag you into this dark hole with me. We can leave in the morning. And never look back. I met an honest soldier. He ain't your normal man. He just wanted to talk to me. Ingrid, you little fool. Where do you think this honest man is goin' to take you? What do you think is gonna happen? I'm leaving! I would rather die a gruesome death than spend one more night here havin' a man touch me. I remember when we was little girls. We used to run through the sunflower fields in North Carolina. You used to tell me that dreams are from God. And that when you stop dreaming, you stop living. Sarah, we aren't living. Dreams aren't real. I ain't too sure God is real. But I ain't goin' to stop you from leavin' here. There you go. Lily, this is yours. - And Charlie. - Thank you. - There you go. - Ooo, muffins are my favorite. And last, but certainly not least, Miss Lizzy. Thank you. You're welcome. So, I got some news. The Army is relocating me up to Montana. That means that we're going to be leaving tomorrow morning. I think it will be a good start for all of us. What will we do up there? The Army has given me some land by a river. And, um. I plan on turning it into a farm. So, we'll be raising crops, and we'll have horses and we'll have sheep and cattle. And there's even a town. And in that town, there's a little school that I'll take you all to. Oh, can I fish on the river? I used to love fishing with Father. You can fish all you want. Yeah. As a family. Yeah. But I caught the most fish. Did you see Father die? No. Hi. Uh, hi. Uh, come in, come in. Hi. I'm Lizzy. Hello, Lizzy. Nice to meet you. I'm Ingrid. Hi, Charlie. Hello, Lily. Um, here. Let me give you somethin' to eat. The three of you sure look alike. Uh, Charlie, Lily, and Lizzy, uh, Ingrid is a. a friend of mine. Um. Can I come with you to Montana? I won't be any trouble. I just. I want a better life. I think it would be nice for her to come with us. Yeah. Um, I... I suppose, yeah. Thank you. Ingrid, do you think you can talk Phil into letting our friends come with us to Montana? I don't think they have any homes. Um, they made friends with other children on the Orphan Train, and they didn't get adopted this morning. But you know what? I know you had a long day today on the trains. And we're gonna have a very long day tomorrow, 'cause if we're gonna be traveling, we're gonna have to pack up. So, I think it's time for you guys to get to bed. I can make a pallet for them by the fireplace. - Oh. - Lizzy and Lily, how about I braid your hair before bed? - Okay. - Yeah. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go, go, go, go. Jack, there're too many! Jack, there's Company K! Thanks for the help, soldier. Let's move out. There may be more comin'. Come on. We've been tracking these Apaches for a while now. Lieutenant Calgrove. Shantu. United States Army, Company K. Ah, you're the Native Union sharpshooting group. Yes, sir. Wait a minute. Calgrove. The letter, please. What letter? You're the father coming for his children. Here's a letter we're delivering to the station in Independence, Missouri. But why didn't it get there? We guard these Orphan Trains at night. We'll pull over to pick on those Apaches you just encountered. And it took us far off track. My son, Phillip Calgrove, lives in Independence, Missouri. That's where he's stationed. They're supposed to be holding them with him there. How far is it? It's about a hundred miles from here. Let's move. The kids are still sleeping. Mornin'. All, uh, all loaded up now. Is everything okay? We don't. we don't know each other, but what I do know is we seem to be in the same place in our lives. We're both searching for a greater purpose. I just. I just can't walk in there and adopt six children. I can barely take care of myself. I had stopped believing in goodness. Until the night we met. From that night on, I. I started thinking maybe there's another way for me. Maybe with these children, I. I could be worth something. I can help you. We can do it. Mary, Addi, Johnny, Jacob, Ray, Jimmy, get out here! Get out here! Lizzy! I miss you. - Jacob. - I miss you so much. Jimmy! Well. your brother already sendin' you back, huh? No, sir. We would like to take our friends with us. I'd, uh, like to formally adopt all these children that were left behind. You serious, sir? Dead serious. Whoo! We could use your help on the farm from all of you guys. Well, you'll all be glad to have a family again, right? - Yes. - Yes, sir. I'll get the paperwork and you can be on your way. - Okay, thank you. - All of ya. Thank you. Ray, welcome to the family. I'm Phil. - What's your name? - Mary. I'm Phil. Goodbye, Frank. I'll miss you, Ray. I'll miss you too. Goodbye, Jimmy. Good luck to ya. Hope to see you again. Thank you. God bless. All right, everyone. We met up with another family leaving town, and together, we set out to start our lives over. Huddled in the back of those wagons, we were ready to take on the world. Charlie, why don't you get up here and show 'em how it's done. - Right over there. - Okay. On your sights. Sit back, everybody. Ooh. Dang, Charlie. - Yeah, Charlie. - Bull's eye, buddy. Doesn't surprise me at all, buddy. Who's next? Can I go next? Yeah, get up here. All right, just like your brother, right at those tin cans I set up. Okay. Now, it's a little loud, so I'm gonna cover your ears. All right. Line up a little bit. You got it? Ooh. Nice shooting, cowgirl. Thanks. Dang, Lizzy, you can shoot. I'll go. That's easy. Hit that one right there. Here you go. Now just like the other two, line it up. Now let her rip when you're ready. Which one of these is the trigger? - Whoa. - Hey. All right, so first rule of handling a gun is, you never aim at another person. Only if it's the bad guy, though. Thank you, Charlie. Only if it's the bad guy. Children, supper's ready. All right, we'll do this later. Come on, Jimmy. As we traveled West, our hearts began to heal from the wound of losing our parents. We let go of our fear and anger. Love re-entered our lives. Corporal. Welcome to Missouri, Lieutenant. Looking for the local orphanage. Can you point us in that direction? Down that way at the edge of town. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm here for my children. Oh, yes, sir. Well, I will need for you to fill out the necessary... I don't think you understand! My children arrived here a few days ago. Phillip Calgrove. Phillip Calgrove, yes. A... And the children. They're... they're with him. Where the hell are they? They're... they're on a wagon train on the way to the Oregon Trail. - It's West. - Tell me! You got a map? You got a map in here? I have many maps. I. I'm sure you can find it. Was there a child named Mary Beggs with them? Mary Beggs, Mary Beggs. Lieutenant, Lieutenant. You cannot travel that alone. You know the route? Sure do. We'll all ride together. Mary's, yes, yes, yes, she's with them. Yes, yes. I remember Mary. She's with them. You'll need this paper. - Thank you so much. - Yes. - Thank you. - Yes. Phil's been assigned to a new post. Someone must have given the order. Looks like you folks left one war, jumped right into another one. Where are they? Here. Bozeman, Montana. See, a lot of these tribes were forced West, and they had their land seized by the government. They blamed the settlers and started raiding the whole area. We had to station men at different posts to help keep the peace. Are the children in danger? Well, the Cheyenne have been causing most of the trouble. Charlie, get the girls. Come on, come on. This way. Come on, come on you guys. We don't want any trouble. We're just passing through. On our way to Montana to farm. Here, come, break bread with us. Hmm. Okay, yeah. Okay. Guys, let's break bread. It'll be okay. No! Get down. Please, please no more. Please, please. Please, enough. Stop! No! Please, please, no more. They're just children. They're children, no! No! No! Charlie, no! Charlie! Charlie, no! Here. He's gone. These children. She's dead. Please, no. Oh no. No. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. Charlie's still breathing. Come here, I got you. I got you, I got you. I got you. Daddy, it hurts. I tried to protect them. You did so good, Charlie. You did so good. Don't you go. Don't you go. Please stay. You're my boy. You're my boy, Charlie. Don't go. I got you. Daddy's here, Daddy's here. Please God, please don't take him. Don't take him. Don't take him. No! Every night. we'd sit around the table. She'd read a Bible verse out of this Bible. We'd take turns sayin' the nightly prayer. Char. Charlie was always the first to say the same prayer. He became a man the day I left. And died an innocent. I know if they shot him. he was trying to save somebody. My husband Charles and I planned to escape the plantation. Mary was a baby. And we wanted to give her a better life. We almost got off that plantation when we got noticed. Charles told me, "You run, and you don't look back." Well, I circled back and. they hammered him to a cross. and set him on fire right in front of my eyes. It doesn't seem fair what some have to go through on this side of life. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm gonna find your daughter, Miss Beggs. I'm gonna get my children back. Nothin's gonna stop me. Nothin'. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna miss you, son. Father, don't go. Oh, Lily. I promise you; I'll be home soon. How do you reckon we find them? We'll lure them to us. Yes. They'll be back for the next wagon train passing by. Just a matter of time. Let's get ready. Take your time. Don't be nervous. Keep calm. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. Phil. Phil. Tell me. Is that where my children are? Did you kill my son?! Did you kill my son?! How many men inside your camp? Many. Many men. All right, you're gonna lead us there. Shantu, take your men. You guys drop down the ridge. I'll meet you in the middle. [Ingrid No! Get off of her. No, get off of her. No. Get back, get back. Move back that way, that way. Lily! - Where'd they go? - They ran that way. Lily! Come on! Come on, come on, come on. Get up. Get up, come on. Phil! Are you okay? - I'm sorry. - I got ya. Watch it. Go get the kids. - Get the kids. - Get her to safety. Where's the girls? Whoa, whoa. Daddy! Daddy! Lizzy, where's your sister? They took her. They took her. - Where? Where? - Under the bridge. Okay. Here's my pistol. If anybody comes near you, shoot. Okay? Okay. Yah! Yah! Yah! Oh, Lily. I got you. Daddy, please, - please don't leave me. - You're safe now. Lily! There you go. Alice. Mary? Mary! - Mary. Mary. - Mommy! Mary! Oh my God. Let me look at you. Oh, you okay? Huh? I missed you so much. I hope you've made peace with God. You killed my son, and I'm gonna make sure every single one of you pay the price. Jack. Please stop. Thank you. We want peace as well. Raise! Fire! Shantu suggested to Father that we honor all lives lost that day. That in order to bring peace, we must first acknowledge our own mistakes and that those in power must seek to break the cycle of violence. We ended up moving to Montana and used the land the government gave us to start an orphanage. We welcomed all who wanted to be a part of our community with the promise to also learn from their traditions. Welcome. Nice to see you. Thanks for bringing the children. My pleasure. Watch your step. Figure it was time I started dreaming again. Jack! [horses' hooves clopping What is your name, child? Little Jack. Little Jack, I'm Lizzy Calgrove. This is my sister Lily Calgrove. Hi, Lily Calgrove. We're gonna take really good care of you. God gives his hardest battles to his strongest soldiers. Father, you held my hand when I was small. You caught me when I fell. You are my hero of my childhood, and my later years as well. You taught me the purpose of life is to discover your gift, develop it and give it away. I know Heaven is a beautiful place because it has you.
