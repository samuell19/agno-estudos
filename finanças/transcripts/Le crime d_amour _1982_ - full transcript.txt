Did you receive the picture? It's a picture of me. I found the dead body of a woman. The police doesn't know yet. I haven't informed anybody. You don't believe me? My name is Jean Doit. I live in La Courneuve. I can tell you where the corpse is. Where are you? Stay here and call again in five minutes. Stay here. - You're sure you'll find it? - Yes, I was there for 3 days. - Did you read this book? - Yes. It's a bit forgotten. It's called The Last Turn. It's an adaptation of James Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. The one that was re-released in a new version. No, there has been 3 of them I think. Make him speak. It could make a good article. News items can be interestingly linked to literature. And the phone call to a newspaper is a good thing. But call the police station. Ask for Pere. Pere. Like... Pere. P-E-R-E. Chief of police Pere. Too bad we don't have a picture. I have one. You have one? It was in the mailbox this morning. It was addressed to me. There was nothing but a picture in the envelope. Weird. It's very weird. The poor little one! It had to happen! I know one like him, near the fire station. He is fat, beautiful, with green eyes, white glasses, his eyes are deep green. I know him well, you know. Nowadays, with all these cars, they all end up run over. But I've seen some who can definitely cross the road. Yes, yes, I assure you. They wait for the red light. But it's such a shame for this one. He was such a pretty cat! Good night, darling. Meow! Meow! Meow! See you tomorrow. I'm an incorrigible chatter. Your friend left. - My friend? - The one who... I don't know him. Doit. Like a doit. D-O-I-T. Jean. I'm 20. I live with my grand-parents in La Courneuve, 13, Abreuvoir Street. No, I never left France. Nor Paris. I like solitude. And poetry. I write some, by the way. That's was a sunny day. I went to that orchard. I often go there, it's near my house. I noticed a white shape. It was a woman, her face covered with blood. The first dead body I have seen. Anything else? Could you show me the place where... We will arrest him, thank you. - No, wait, so... - I love... I love melodramas. Yes, but it's a melodrama with restrain. I love melodrama with restraint. - Is that all. - That's all. The proof. Come with us. The man hit her skull very strongly. Show up at the police-station tomorrow at 10:30 A.M. Quai des Orf?vres, ask for Inspector Delaitre's office. I'd like to talk to Mr Naulet. I'm Jean Doit. Naulet? Someone is looking for you. His name is... - Jean Doit. - Jean Doit. Wait for him, he's coming downstairs. Eat. It will be cold. Why did you call me? Why me and not someone else? It's simple. Marco. Marco Serrat. He gave me the tip. I know Marco from Benard, the real-estate agent. That was the reason for the picture! - I thought, maybe... - After seeing the picture... - I'd look for the original. - I wasn't wrong. - You don't look like one. - Like what? Nothing. How much can I get? For the article. It's none of my business. It's none of the newspaper's business. Talk to the board, see if it's accepted. How much do you want? 600. - It'll do. - When. Call me tomorrow. Tomorrow? I can give you an advance. Would 200 do? 250? It will do. See you tomorrow. Let me tell you straight. It won't work with me. I'm made for women's bodies. - Do you think it's funny? - No, no. Your sentence is funny. - That kind of sentence always made me laugh. - Laugh then. Let me tell you again. Expect nothing from me. I'm not really into sex. If I want a girl, I pay her. It's neat, no trouble. Romance... is not part of what I write. What do you write? I write. A young man fond of literature. Do you have a job? No. I worked in a bookshop 6 months ago. Not bad to start an examination. "Do you have a job?" Classic. How do you live? Welfare. And I gamble... Horse racing. Did you see that? My typing machine. A little invention of my own. It's quicker. And more intimate. It's not officially accepted, but the time will come. Do you have a job? No. I worked in a bookshop 6 months ago. Not bad to start an examination. "Do you have a job?" Classic. How do you live? Welfare. And I gamble... Horse racing. What if you did it? Why? Catch public attention. My face in the newspapers? I'm not interested. Still, you called the press, not us. You write stuff, I saw. Yes. Maybe you will find an editor. It's being done a lot nowadays. They are publishing murderers' memoirs. I didn't kill. I said what I saw and how I saw it. You are free to go. Of course, the custom is you remain at our disposal. Yes? I have your money. I need to see you. As soon as possible. I have a very important information for the investigation. A date. But it will be expensive. - Name your price. - I prefer to meet you. Okay but not at the office. I'll be home in an hour. 7 Volta Street. Arts & M?tiers station. First floor, right door. I have something for you, since you've become a specialist of news items. A rape. Can we get more sensational? A man, not young, 54 years old, not an illegal alien or a Yugoslavian, nor a good old homie French, broke into his neighbours' place. They had been neighbours for 6 years. He raped them all, in a weird order by the way. Mother, father and daughter. Then he shot a bullet in his own heart. The end. Not bad, right? Not bad. So it's true. Children love to be told beautiful stories. But this one is not what one could call a beautiful story. My mother... it was not easy to find her. But when one wants... She was still living with the man that had taken her. The man she had run away with. That they had run away, I thought it was beautiful. It was not a problem. Our first meeting... was a bit disappointing. People disappearing with a lover always seem mysterious. But she was not. She was a very simple, little lady. The man was... banal. A musician, though. A man playing the piano in bars. But he was no Gary Cooper. They were living a simple life, for people who had once run away. We became friends. You'll see how close. One evening I stopped by their house. They were waiting for friends for diner. My mother told me: "Jeanne, please, the people coming are respectable." "They don't know about you." "I'll say you're a family friend." I was 16. Not bad. Not bad, yes. Great painting! So what is is, Jean? What did you make up again? By the way, here is the rest. Not bad? - You like them young. - Very young. He's my son. His name is Patrick. - Does he look like his mother? - His mother is not bad either. Your wage is not bad at the newspaper. Not bad, not bad. It's stinking rich. - Do you have a shower? - A shower. And even a bathtub. - Do you mind if I take one? - A shower? No. This way. Not bad, huh? Michel? It's Sylvie. I've been calling you. It's hard to reach you. With your weird schedule I never know if you work mornings or afternoons. Still the same... if you know what I mean. If you want Patrick, it would be convenient for me next week. Call me. Bye. Hello? It's Jean Doit. I have new informations about the case. It's sensational. Well, I'll call again. This is me! Yes, it's you. What are your sensational news? The body... I found it on the 5th, not the 8th. Tell me, Jean. Do you know this is a murder case? It's not a game. If what you're saying is true, you made a perjury. What are you looking for? More money? You're wrong. Anyway, such an information can't be bought. Too bad. I have another buyer. Maybe. But I have to tell the police. We had diner at 7:30 PM, as usual. My mother barely eats in the evening. She was ready and put make-up on. Can't I come with you? No, not tonight Darling. But I'd like to watch the movie again, too. No, not tonight. What will you do with me? What will become of me? Hello, Mrs Dumont? Mrs Odette Dumont? Are you Jeanne Berger's sister? I mean Jeanne Bontemps. My name is Michel Naulet. Yes, I'm a journalist. Would accept to... I told you! Five tries, five denials. Tailing after tailing, I came, I saw... and now I know. She goes out everyday at 8:15 AM with her son. A big, 22 years old boy. You can see his bike her. He works as an architect, near Gerbeau in Sireux. The market is closed. She comes back around 10. Her second walk is around 3 PM. On the Wednesdays, to the library. The other days, excepting week-ends, to Square Jules Ferry, 300 meters away from the City Hall. Here she comes! Let me hide. The dead in the wasteland was a singer. What a surprise! She's easy to recognize. She looks like her sister. Didn't you know? Odette is Jeanne. Jeanne is Odette. They look alike! You are not reading Tailing Magazine. This was the scoop in my first article. The victim had a twin sister! The victim had a twin sister! Me, 20 years old. You, 20 years old. Money for your bullshit, it's over. We may start to be angry. Listen... Don't force me to play the bad cop, sending you to jail only for perjury. Because it is how what you did is called. Well, testify a second time and don't play dumb. You got it? It's strange. What is strange? You're not bad for a guy. You could find girls. I mean without paying them. Do I ask why you do this? I, you know... I'm not a professional. I just do it like that. Girls like me are called shooting stars. I am a shooting star. I do it from time to time, to make ends meet. But don't get it wrong. I choose. I won't go with some guys. You know... We are all whores. Sell your body or your brain, it's all the same. I have principles. No pictures before we find an agreement. How much? Maybe we could introduce each other first. Very well. Figaro. Seila, Le Quotidien. - Pierre Senes, Paris Match. - Jean-Louis Ferouchi, Nouvel Obs. Filature. We planed it before you arrived. We had time. Our appointment was at 10 PM, I think. - It's 10:45 PM now. - A glass of milk, please. We don't pay for this kind of information. It's not for the kind of newspaper we work for. The first thing to do is to call the police. It's done. It's done? It's done. It's done. Anyway, we don't pay for this kind of information. You're losing your time. If you just want to catch the attention, or earn some money... I think you can talk to this gentleman. Forget it, it's my round. We are interested. But we'd need a detailed story. Talk about your private life. We have thought of a photo story. What is your price? 8000. We will offer you 5000. It will do. Have a more tense face! More dramatic! Make it obvious! Come on! You just saw a dead body! Mom! Somebody is here for Carl! Carl? Carl... Leave it to me. Carl what? What? Yes, Carl Burger. I'm a friend of Carl. I don't know you. My husband works at night and my daughter is asleep. Good evening, Mrs Dumont. I was told, for Jeanne. I have nothing to say. I have no time. I gave nothing to tell you. Carl Burger died 15 years ago. How old were you then? 16. I was very young. I saw you roaming the neighbourhood. What are you looking for? I have nothing to tell you. Leave me alone. Where is it? How was the woman? Laying. The body was covered with a white sheet. Wait! The blood! Wait. My handkerchief, it's a souvenir. Don't overdo it. Was it like this? Photo! Photo. The blood! Not on the handkerchief, it's a souvenir. Meeting in a theater. Rendez-vous in a wasteland. Love at first sight. A singing woman. So, my treasure? A face like yours... It's a treasure. If I want, I can use it as a treasure. I loved a man once. A long time ago. I used to call him Sky, because he had blue eyes. Blue is not good for a face. What do you do? Odd jobs. Odd jobs... And I write. A poet! Are you writing things for a child living in a house like this one? A child waiting for her life to turn good. You gently take her hand when the night is beautiful. You sit in a park, on a bench. Or in the stairs near the cellar. It beaks her heart to see your blue eyes. You are waiting for the doors of life to open. Life will sow flowers in your footsteps. A girl of your age. 20, right? Everything is happening here... and here. - Gross. - No, that's the way it is. My death is tiptoeing on the snow. Is that the kind of things you write? I wish I could, but no. It's a sentence stuck in my head. A sentence from a book. I will be a vagabond. It will be different. Different from what? Do you mean a different world? Yes, of course! The change will be brutal. I wish I could live long enough to see it. A different world. Or maybe this planet will burst before anything changes. But I don't think so. I don't know... Everything has changed already, hasn't it? This is the story of a guy who had black eyes. It ended badly. You have sentences in your head, I have songs. This was an old Gypsy song. I used to sing. Let's not talk about it. If I wanted to tell you a nice story, like in movies or the books you love... I'd tell you it's a song my mother used to sing. But it's not true. My mother... The first time I saw here... She was the kind of woman to elope with a man. I was 2 years old when she left. My father died from it. One can die from love. - Some people don't believe it, but it's true. - Suicide? No. To die from love. I told you. It's like desperation. It's a gun of desperation. You know... I know. Too late. Too late! As for what's left... we talked too much. I don't fuck with people I talk to. By the way, we are alike, aren't we? I have always been haunted by an idea. The idea of a crime. Yes, why not? A perfect crime. Would you be the assassin? I don't know. Me, or somebody else. If it were you... you'd need to find someone waiting for his death. That way, you'd deliver him from his life. Were you sleeping? No, I was thinking of the past. So? So my dream was too short. Souvenirs plus dreams. "Plus dream". You need to shower? Can I? Basta! There's something else. I'll be the one writing it this time. ...guilty. Jean Doit. Here. I want to deliver my heart from something too heavy. I killed Jeanne Bontemps in the orchard in La Courneuve. I could explain it, but nobody would understand. Neither money nor sex were a reason. I want to plead guilty. Jean Doit. Tear it up, Jean. It makes no sense. It's literature. Get it for. You know what that means? It means forget it, in backward-slang. Get it for. I've been thinking of you a lot. What a nice story! Why? For this? Or this? You remind me of a character in a novel I read long ago. I thought of something too. They will judge me. They will want my head and they will have it. It's my present. Beg for it, maybe they will give it to you. It will be cool near all of these! Since you love what is beautiful... It will be... perfect! No. Your picture will do. They will want you head and they will probably get it. True. But they won't behead it. We don't cut the many heads nowadays. - But they will imprison you. - All the best! I've always wanted to be imprisoned! - Don't you think... - Get it for! I'm not bad. Fran?oise. I'm a friend of Marco. Now I'm almost done! I have to go through it. I had the press and the prison. The tribunal and the jury now. My story is such a melodrama! I have to turn it into words. A meeting in a theater. Rendez-vous in a wasteland. Love at first sight. A singing woman. She was alive when I left her. Who came after I left? Who killed? What else? A 3 years old picture. Photojournalism. That's how it will start. The air is dusky and the night is blue in Paris. A car is passing by. Its light grazed the windows of a phone booth with a reddish glow. The air is dusky... - You are such a liar! - Me, a liar? No... Of course, I never knew Carl Burger. I learned about him in the newspapers, just like everybody. The name sounded like it would put me on some tracks; Or open some door. Yours, in example. Why are you so interested in that story? A professional reflex, maybe? Or what? It's simpler. I have the conviction that Jean Doit is innocent. The assassin... The real culprit... You are probably the only one to know who he is. You don't lack imagination. Do you think I'm an accomplice? I just think you are the only one who can truly talk about Jeanne Bontemps. The investigation didn't find anything. But you... I said what I had to say. What I knew. - As for what?s left. - The assassin may be there. - In what's left... - I think Jeanne made a mess of her life. She failed in everything. First, there was that story with Carl. Strange story. He was a strange guy too. I had met him first. We were supposed to get married. Then I introduced him to Jeanne. And... They eloped together. A white guy with light eyes. A white guy with blue eyes. Very gentle, often sad. They had the same temper. I mean the same temper as Jeanne. Him and her... what a love story! But it ended badly. He... He committed suicide. Goodbye, heart-throb. Carl's suicide... Her career as a singer, her family... The investigation told us about all that. What about the Grey areas? There are some. I don't I'm betraying Jeanne confessing it because... She was not the kind of woman to hide. One night, I came home after a family diner. I never came to family meetings, she said it was giving her stomach aches. It was quite late. She was sitting there. I would have been afraid. 20 years passed... In the end, apart from our faces... and our voices, according to people... We were absolutely opposite. How opposite? Well, Jeanne had convictions I don't have. I have a family life, children... I mean, Jeanne was doing things I wouldn't do. For example, she went to the theater the day before she died. She used to bring the child, our niece Catherine. She went all alone that night. There was a guy sitting next to her. Wearing a hat. Jean Doit. I can't say. The film was dark and I didn't dare looking at them. During the screening... They... were talking. That's something I'd not do. Remember all your comings and goings! Remember. Try to be as precise as possible. There are things you can't do twice. You have to. It's the law. Do it now. I stood up. Do it. That's it. You're missing the most important. What she told me. What happened before. - Did she fight back? - No. Are you lying? - No. - Jean... You're gambling your head. It's time for explanations. I can not. Doit. Lawyer. I am your lawyer. I'm court-appointed by the President of the Bar. - I will defend you. - I have nothing to say. No case is lost before it's pleaded. But you have to help me. At 20, your whole life is ahead of you/ Thank you. It's crazy how you love reading. Everything that end up in your hands. Like Jeanne. Is it yours? No. It's Jeanne's. I found it at her place. There's a section she underlined. 3 exceptional pages on love. There is the one who loves and the one who is loved. Two different worlds. What do you think? Can't love be shared? I mean, equally shared. You can't talk about love while shelling peas. Are you freaking out? Don't. Jeannot must be delighted. The criminal court is his apotheosis You can't understand. You know, we were born in feces. Do you know the 13th? 13th arrondissement. The stream, as you people call it. You know, for people like, life and prison are all the same. Freedom is for the rich. A child's heart is a delicate organ. A cruel start in life can give it a strange shape. The child I was... To Cr?teil, man. Modern tribunal. If you're expecting a spacious grave, you will be disappointed. It's small and white. It's modern. Curious people don't go visit it anymore. There wouldn't be space for them anyway. No, it's very intimate. Then it becomes formidable. The couple go for a walk on a Sunday. They don't really know where to go. There is the sea, the sun... People are at a ball. And as the day go on... Vivien Leigh, the main role, realizes nothing special is happening. Rossano Brazzi is making fun of her. Then it's the end of the day and she provokes him. She dumps him. We see the sun setting. It's the end. Can we meet again? Yes, why not. Red light! You are accused of having killed, on the 5th, at 5 PM Jeanne Bontemps. A crime you admitted. Yes, Sir. - Do you confirm your declaration? - Yes, Sir. - Assassin! - Silence! The audience must remain silent or leave the courtroom! - What do you have to say for your defense? - Nothing. That Thursday was formidable. That woman is the greatest thing I have known on this planet. Anyway, if I had let her died from what you call "natural death"... that would made no difference. Psychiatrists assure you are mentally sane. - We can doubt it. - I don't think I am mad. I may say I regret what I did. I won't. To the question "Was the murder perpetuated..." "with the aggravating factor of premeditation?" The answer was "Yes", for the majority of the jurors. To the question about mitigating circumstances The answer was "No" for a majority of 8 jurors. Jean! Jeanne... Who was Jean Doit? Who was Jeanne Bontemps? Will they take their secrets? Come in. Can we meat again? Yes, why not. It's me. I killed Jeanne. The nonchalant attitude, even provocative of Jean Doit, his refusal to explain, his silences, his answers that weren't, all that probably influenced the brutality of the verdict. Grey areas remain. Who was Jean Doit? Who was Jeanne Bontemps? Will they take their secret? She was singing. She didn't like to talk about herself. She told me so. She could have become a star, a real star. There was a man. He could have helped her. She refused. She had a speciality. The Belle Epoque, song from 1900. Songs of love. I loved you so much, you, the child My lover Honey of my twenties, my lover You, the child, my child Your death was discreet, You, the child, my lover In the secret room Hotel L'Avenue I loved you so much, you, the child My lover Honey of my twenties, my lover You, the child, my child 15 years ago, she began to become renowned. 2 or 3 albums, a movie... She went to classy cabarets. But her repertoire was not really on-trend. I told her a thousand times to sing modern songs. She didn't want to. Jeanne would only do what she liked. She was a singer that had never learned. As a child, she was already crazily successful. I was kind of jealous. Because when it comes to singing, seducing or being loved... Yes... I was jealous. One question. The last one. It's not the journalist talking to you anymore. What brought you here tonight? That kid. Jean Doit. I have a son of his age, you know. Doit was too perfect an assassin, the real culprit: her twin sister. Fran?ois, I won! I'm done with hassles. I was voluntarily hospitalized. The four walls of my cell are my escape, my desertion, my rest. I had to go through my story with what I had lived, or dreamed. Anyway, I won. If I go out of prison, it will be to go to an asylum. Send Michel my kisses. I love him as I love you. My work is progressing: 52 pages. The matter is... that the house is... far from the bridge. And the bridge... is behind the hill. The society hurt me a lot. Would you have some honey? You're a good actor. But you... you had understood it. That you didn't kill her? I told you. It makes no sense, it's literature. When I met you... something happened. Strange night. I fainted. You know... Your tenderness was enough for me. Your body... Anyway, I would have fucked you if I wanted to. Don't pretend, I know you've done it already. You were born in the street. You went to jail? Get it for. The matter is... - That the house is far from the bridge. - And the bridge is behind the hill. This is a nice hospital. - It looks like a garden. - It is a garden. There must be that kind of weeks. Love is first sight weeks. It was just another week, though, before you went to that theater. The movie was Come back to Sorrento. An American movie, shot in Italy with French dialogues. In Technicolor. The most surprising is that when you sat between these women, that film had already begun. You couldn't see them in the dark. You didn't know you were sitting near two similar women. Twice the exact same woman. If you had taken the left seat, instead of the right... It would have changed everything. Odette would never have looked at you or talked to you. There would be no story. We wouldn't be here today. I intended to sit next to Jeanne. That's where I put my ass. The same face. That's all. There can't be two lovers, don't look for that. Don't rack your brain. This is a beautiful story now. It's all in here. The air is dusky and the night is blue in Paris. A car is passing by. Its light grazed the windows of a phone booth with a reddish glow... Be careful with the autobiographical part. Don't worry, I'm transposing. Stuck on the sidewalk of a murky avenue. The weirdness of a phone conversation. We talk to an object, and it feels like we talk to ourself. We can't see the listener. Sometimes we don't even know him, as Fran?ois, that night. "Did you receive the picture?" Four months later, the psychiatric institute gave Jean Doit his discharge document. Shortly afterwards, was published a short story entitled "Black and Blue". Some people remember the book. But Jean has disappeared. The end Subtitles: tadanobu@KG Correction: Elan
