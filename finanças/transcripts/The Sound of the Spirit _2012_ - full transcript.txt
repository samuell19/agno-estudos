- This portion beginswith these key words. You shall be holy for ithe lord your god am holy. How are we to be holy? Well, let's read off becausethe sages tell us this is one of the most importantpassages of the torah. It not only tells us to keepshabbat, honor our parents, not Mike idols, all familiarfrom the ten commandments, but it tells us youshall not hate your brother in your heart. You should correct himwhen he's wrong, but you should love himas yourself. This is how ajew treats a Jew. - Here's the very verseyeshua matches up with, the one about loving godfrom deuteronomy 6. These are the greatestcommandments, and on them, all others hang. It always strikes me howit's just before the part about not eating the fruitoff the trees for the first few years, like that old Lyric, the way you hold your knife, the way you changed my life. Bang, right in the middleof everything, there it is. You shall nothate your brother. Instead, you shall loveyour neighbor as yourself. May I have thisshabbat dance? - I was like four, dad. I'm way too old todance on your shoes now. - Well, then maybe I shoulddance on yours because you're gettingso much taller. - I sort ofremember her laugh. I hope I never forget. - When I dance with you, itbrings her laughter back. - I only wish your mothercould be with us to see your bat mitzvah. Daddy, you'remaking me so sad. - I don't mean to. It's just that I know howmuch she looked forward to it. To be able it see you in frontof all of your friends saying, here I am, a young Jewish womantaking my place, a daughter of Rebecca. - Don't remind me. You now how much I hatestanding up in front of people, even as adat yeshua. And anyway, she didn't evenknow we'd have it there. - I'd be so proud of you. - I wish uncle Sidney andaunt Jackie could come. They live so close, and we haven't even seen them since mom died. - I don't thinkthey'd come, Rivka. You know how they feelabout where we attend. I'm sorry you don'tget to see them. Maybe we can invitethem next time. It's just been so long. - Lord, I pray uncle sidneyand aunt Jackie will come to the bat mitzvah. I pray that daddyand uncle Sidney will run into each othersomewhere, and they'll get togetherand catch up on old times like brothers do. And it would be so wonderful for them to see meget bat mitzvahed. Thank you forhearing my prayer. - Amen. - Settle down everyone. Let's get started. The church has been trying to convert the jewsfor centuries. It's just another way of sayinggod rejected the Jews. First they madeour Bible Christian, and now they're usingthis deception to take our childrenand make them Christian. - This is justspiritual genocide. They're not tryingto kill us this time, just stop the jewsfrom being Jewish. - You're so right, Harry. We've got to educatethe next generation. How all throughjewish history they've tried to convert jewsinto christians. Sometimes with violence, other times more subtly. If they had succeeded, there would be nojewish people today. - Come on, everyone, what are you talking about? This is America. We're all about free speechand freedom of religion and that sort of thing. No one's twisting any armsin this messianic thing. Let people believewhat they want. - Please, let me getmy point across. You're right, Stephen, we need to educate our kidsand protect them. So what do I mean bythe messianic menace. - We all know whatyou mean, shuster. We weren't born yesterday. Just tell us why we're here. - I'm getting to it. - Well, get to it then. - Harry, stop interrupting, and he'll get to it. - Thank you, Patty. All right, I'm gettingto it now. We want to bring thisyosi Cohen fella in. - Yosi Cohen who? - Yosi Cohen, the anti-missionary. It's a way to educate usand more importantly educate our children. They need to be awareof these people and their agenda. - Sidney, isn't thiswhat happened with your brother? - I don't want to talkabout Marty, okay? - What are youtalking about? He did this afterhe lost ruthie, didn't he? - Alan, what aboutsidney's brother? - Of course, that'sbeside the point. This is about our children. - What are youtalking about? Maybe he shouldtalk to Cohen. I mean, we're paying tobring this yosi schmo in. - Okay, Sidney, maybe youcan invite your brother. - I don't talkto my brother. I haven't talkedto him in years. - You should talk toyour brother, Sidney. He's your brother. - You do what you do, alan, I'll do what I do. - This isn't grouptherapy, let's vote. - It's getting late. - Empty nester. Well, welcome to the club. It's not so bad. At least it's quiet. Let's face it, we're pastthe age of picking up after the kinder. - Sidney, isn't thatyour brother over there? It's across the street, isn't that him? - Here you go, Sidney. Will there be anything else? - Okay, that's it. - On the tab? - Thanks, schlomie. - You're welcome. - well, I guess it'ssome kind of sign. - Well, I guess it'ssome kind of sign. - All right, howare you today? - Fine, thank you. - You ready to order? - Well, my brother'ssupposed to meet me here. He should havebeen here by now. To tell you the truth, i haven't seen him in a long time. Maybe he won't even show up. - How long has it been? - Let's just sayit's been a long time. - So I guess i'lljust come back then. - You're late. - I hope not too late. - You're too late. - Always the joker. - That's me. Man, it's been a long time. Want something to eat? - No, I ate at home. - You look good, man. - Thanks, thanks. - I've missed you Sidney. - Yeah. - However, what kind ofbrother doesn't contact his little brotherafter two years... - Wait, just a... - Wait, let me finish. Even when he's receivedphone calls and more than one. - Did I get a call? - Yes. - I don't remembergetting a call. - As a matter of fact, I think I was the last oneto call. - Look, let's not argueabout who called who last, about how long it's been. But I do recall, now thati think of it, our last conversation didn't go so well. You meanabout yeshua? - You mean Jesus Christ? You tried to convert me ifyou remember correctly. - What are youtalking about? - Those verses theybrainwashed you with. - You asked me whathappened, so I told you. - I wasn't askingfor a lecture. - Okay, can we changethe subject here? - Yeah, great. - Aren't you goingto ask me about Rivka? You know I keep upwith your kids, by the way, on Facebook. - Yeah. - How's Jackie doing? - She's good, thanks. And I hear goodthings about Rivka. I hear she's doing well. - She's doing very well. - At school? - All a's, verybright, sharp girl. You should see her now allgrown up and beautiful looking, at age 12. You know she's having herbat mitzvah this year. - At that place? That's nice. You know, she looks likeher mother, I'm sure. May she rest in peace. But speaking of that, i must tell you, Marty, I can no longer keepthe promise I made to you. You know the one imade when ruthie died. I mean, I'm sureyou understand. Things have changed. We couldn't take her in in the event something wereto happen to you, god forbid. - What are youtalking about, Sidney? - You know whati'm talking about. You walked awayfrom your faith, you walked awayfrom your family. Your daughter was brainwashed by the same peoplethat brainwashed you. - You should have half thebrain that she has, Sidney. I can't believe you wouldreject your own niece. She's your family, your mishpacha. - That has nothingto do with it. She wouldn't fitin a Jewish home. - How do you knowwhat she would do? You don't even know her. You don't even know her. Does Jackie feelthe same way? - Well, I haven't askedher, but I'm sure she would agree. Okay, look, enough of that. We have someone coming into talk about those things you believe. You might want to hear him. He knows more than both of usput together about these things. His name is yosi Cohen. - Yeah, i'veheard him twice. - Well, he's good. He's very entertaining. - A regular Seinfeld. - Okay, right, i won't ask again. Well, look, i gotta be somewhere. Let's not stayso scarce? - I agree, Sidney. Let's really keepin touch this time. - Yeah, yeah. Well, plan on it. You know, you're my littlebrother, and neither of us is as young as we used to be, and I miss you, even if we disagree. You're my flesh and blood. Well, I gotta go. You take care. Until the next time, okay? - All right. Flesh and blood. Until next time. - Yeah, bye. - Rivka? Rivka, Chinese. - What do you know? A vegetarian wonderland. - Well, tofu will make youstronger in time for your bat mitzvah. - Yeah, but I'm inthe mood for chicken. - Well, chickentomorrow, tofu today. Speaking of today, how was yours? - Not bad. - Okay. Any specifics? - Not really. - Okay, when you were liketen, I couldn't stop you, and now I can'tget you started? - I had to forgive twogirls today at school for being mean to me. - A fool shows hisannoyance at once, but a prudent manoverlooks an insult. - Yeah, you always quotethat verse from proverbs. - Because it's true. So what did they do? - I don't know, i overlooked it. Sort of. Let's talk about your day. Anything unusual in thelife of Martin margolis? - Yes, as a matter of fact, thank you for asking. It was an unusual day. How'd you know somethingunusual happened? You always know whensomething unusual happens. - What's up? - Well, what's up is I hadlunch with your uncle Sidney just like you prayed. - Wow. Really? - Wow, god heard me. - That's right. - Wow. I haven't seen himin like forever. And? - Well, and we argued fora little bit, but we both decided that you're fabulousand doing fabulous. - He remembers me? I hardly remember him. - Well, of course you werea little shorter then. - Yeah, a lot shorter. So when do iget to see him? We have to invite themto the bat mitzvah now. Did you invite them? - No, not yet, but maybewhen we see him next time. - Before I growmuch more I hope. No! Dad! - I don't feel well. - Let's go, we'llboth be late, okay? I got your toast. - See you at 3. - Okay, have a good day. Don't forget tooverlook those insults. - I won't. Love you. - Love you. - See you at 3. - dad, where are you? It's 4 o'clock. - Rivka? Can you come insidefor a moment? - well, how are you doing? - Sidney, howshould she be doing? - Right. - We need to talk. Sidney, stay. Honey, you'll beliving with us. - What are youcrazy, Jackie? She can't live with us. She wouldn't be happy. I just told martythe other day... - Marty isn't here. You have a better idea? - I guess not. For the memory of mybrother, okay for now. But she won't be happy. - She won't be happyfor quite a while, and not for now, Sidney. For her, for her, for Rivka. - Okay, okay. Oy. What my brother Marty, may he rest in peace, put me throughwith this Christ thing. The cemetery, they gave mesuch tsuris about it, but at least they're taking him. - Shhhh, she'll hear you. - Martin margolis waspreceded in death by his beloved wife Ruth, mayshe be remembered for a blessing. They shared a full andloving life, and together they raised theirbeautiful daughter Rivka. 7 years ago, Martin losthis beloved wife ruthie. Life has been difficultsince then for both father and daughter. But Martin Rose to theoccasion and was a loving and caring father for hisbeloved and beautiful Rivka. Today, our hearts go outwith great compassion for Rivka. - I've got to livewith my aunt and uncle. I don't know whati'm going to do. I mean, I haven'tseen them in years. And they're nice, but... - I love you. If they'll let you cometo the synagogue, they've got to let you cometo adat yeshua. - I'm coming, I'll be thereevery week no matter what. I don't know how i'llget there, but... - My parents, they can take you. I know they will for sure. - Then we'll see youthere this weekend. - I don't wantto live with them. Pray for me. I know they meanwell, but... I don't like it. I want my old room, that bigold stuffed bean chair your mom gave me. - We'll rescue you, and the bean chair. We're sisters for life. - You know with the kids gone, we have to have anothertalk with her. - Tomorrow. We just spent 7 days withevery conceivable relative and stranger traipsingthrough here. - Maybe. Maybe now is best. - Oy vey. - Rivka, honey, I know thismust be very, very difficult for you. You've lost so much. You miss your... - I miss everything, everything, aunt Jackie. I don't belong here. I like you, but dad anduncle Sidney haven't even talked in years. I feel like, like... - That was wrong. I can't argue with that. - We talked justthe other day. - Sidney, I don'tthink she means... - He told me, uncle Sidney. I know we were goingto get together, but that doesn't changehow I feel. - Rivka, you're our niece, and even though he haven't had the chance to see yougrow up to be so pretty and so smart, we love you, and we want you to live with us. It would be an honor. - Right. That's right. Your dad and I agreed. We discussed it. - A few days ago? You talked aboutthis a few days ago? - Well, we discussedthe possibility. - Then it's destined. It's bashert. - I don't know about that. - What about my friends, my synagogue, my life? - Your friendsare your friends. You choose your friends. We would never takethat away from you. But we also hope you'll makenew friends besides the ones at school and yourother friends. - I guess ihave to say this. We're a family, a mishpacha, and we have a synagogue. Families go tosynagogue together. That's the way it'ssupposed to be. You can see your friendsat other times, but we want you to cometo synagogue with us. - I don't wantto talk right now. - Okay, Rivka, listen, anything you need or want... - I think I wantto sleep now. I'm tired. - I think that'sa good idea. It's been a verydifficult day. - Nicky blavitznice to meet you. - Hi, I'm Rivka. - Sorry about your dad. I hope you joinour y.J.A. Group, young Jewish alliance, it's a great group. - Yeah, sure. Are you all in it? - Yeah, we are. - Who was Jacob bluestein, some founder or something? - You mean who isjacob bluestein? He's the richest manin the synagogue. Lots of money to giveif you know what I mean? - Yeah. - He's got his name on likefive rooms all over the place. Bluestein chapel, bluestein men's room. That was a joke. He's right over there. I get it. Because I knowof this big church that has an old folks' home that's named after somerich guy like that. - What? - Never mind. - Well, did youenjoy the service? - It was okay. - Well, it seemedlike you did. You knew everything. You chanted like a cantor. - Your uncle's sayinghe's proud of you. Aren't you, Sidney? - Well, it's a mitzvahto have, you know... - I'm studying for mybat mitzvah at adat yeshua. I see. - Rivka, it wouldmean so much to us. We would be so honoredif you would have your bat mitzvah with usat banai Israel. Maybe you could thinkabout it, let us know? Your friends from your... from your chapel could come, and well, I'm sure rabbi Stein and Dr. pozner wouldwork with you. - Hi. Yeah, listen, ican't talk right now. Yeah, yeah, i'llcall you later, okay? Um, about half an hour. Okay. okay, all right, bye. - You can talkto your friend. - It was my rabbi. - He's calling on shabbat? I never heard of a rabbi callingon a congregant on shabbat. - Well, I don't know. He's like a friend. - I'm sure he's very nice. - Do you knowjacob bluestein? - You mean thee jacobbluestein in our synagogue? - Is there another? I didn't think there wasroom for two. - Yes, that one. - Everyone knowsjacob bluestein. Well, don't you think heshould give his money kind of without letting hisright-hand know what his left is doing? Like more private. It's just, I mean, that signover the door, it's just, well, I know of this bigchurch with an old folks' home that's namedafter some rich... Never mind. - That's a verywise saying, Rivka. You know, not letting hisright hand know what his left hand is doing, it's very rabbinic. You know, there are a lotof women rabbis these days. - Sidney, stop joking. - I wasn't joking. - A rabbi? Not me, uncle Sidney. I hate public speaking. - Rabbi, my aunt and unclewant me to go to their synagogue, and be bat mitzvahed there. - I see. What do you think? - I don't know. I don't know what to do. - It must be alittle overwhelming. Are they putting pressureof any kind on you? - No, no. They're trying to be nice. They want me to bekind of like family. You know, go where they go. - Right in the middle ofyour bat mitzvah classes? - It's a little strange, and I don't know what dad would want me to do. I'm confused. They want all the kidsfrom adat yeshua to come. - I see. Okay, how about yourfear of public speaking? - I'd rather do itsomewhere where I know the people, but... Maybe the lordwants me to do it. - I see. Well, I know you coulddo it there with your aunt and uncle. You could show themwhat you've learned, Rivka. Will this be the sameweekend, the same portion? - They haven'ttalked about that yet. - Daddy, I'm ready todouble jump your king. - I hear hava, i'll call you next week. I'll try to comesee you soon. I can call the office andset up an appointment, okay? - That wouldbe great, Rivka. - Bye. - Here, let mehelp with that. Come on. - Sure.- I got it. - Thanks, uncle Sidney. It's pretty heavy. - Yeah. - Okay, almost done. I'll go get the last of it. - Okay. - your father would rollover in his grave if he knew that a family member werereading the new testament in this house. - Shhhh. - but when you do sedaka, good deeds like giving, do not let your left hand knowwhat your right hand is doing so that your sedakamay be in secret, and your father who seesin secret shall reward you. - I think these y.J.A. Meetingsare over at about 9. You know what? I haven't been getting theannouncements for a long time, so I do think it would bea good idea for you to maybe get acquainted with someof the kids at the synagogue, don't you? - I guess so. Uncle Sidney, they saidit's over at 9 o'clock. Please don't be late. - I won't. I like driving someoneto these meetings again. Especially you. Have a good time. I'll see you at 9. - You want a coke, Rivka? - No thanks. I can get it. - Of course you can, you have two hands. How old did yousay you were? - I didn't say. - And? - And I'm 12. Almost 13. you're studyingfor your bat mitzvah then? - Yes. - Where'd you sayyou went to synagogue? - I didn't. - Well? - Well what? - Where do yougo to synagogue? - Hey, man. - My father and iwent to adat yeshua. Ever heard of it? - No, never heard of it. - That may be becauseit's messianic. The yeshua part is hebrewfor salvation, as in Jesus. Any other questions? I didn't think so. - Hey, Nicky.- Hey, how's it going? - Is Sarah around?- Yeah, she's back there. - Cool, thanks. - What's with you? - Just when doesthis thing start? - Soon. So tell me about thissynagogue you go to. - Are you serious? - Yeah. it sounds cool. - Well, some people thinkit's the opposite of cool. Like not evena Jewish thing. - You seem totallyjewish to me. - Well, I am, so I thinki'll take a seat now. - Everybody come over here. Rivka's going to tellus about her synagogue. - Nicky, please don't. - What are you afraid of? She's a messianic. Does everyone knowwhat that means? - I think I do. - Rivka's going to tell uswhat she believes, aren't you Rivka? - Well, I could try to explainit if you guys wanted me to. yeah. - Well, how was it?- Okay. Yeah, it was okay. - That's good. That was the blavitzboy, wasn't it? - I think so.- What's his name? - Nicky. Well, well, i think it's Nicky. - okay, so I was at thisy.J.A. Meeting, and it started with this cuteboy named Nicky blavitz. - What? - Yeah, and he callseveryone over, and they all ask me a million questionsabout messianic judaism, et cetera, et cetera. I'd never seenanything like it. Their questions were reallyinteresting like what do you believe? And what's your servicelike over there? And I don't know. - I bet he's gorgeous. - Yeah, he is. And rhena, i just lost my dad. Read Hamlet, he wasn't readyfor his mom to remarry, and I'm not ready to like Nicky. - I hear you. Even though I haven't readhamlet like you advanced english lit folks, I hear myrivka coming back to life. You sound almost... Happy. - Yeah. Yeah, maybe. I guess so. I do feel a littlebetter, a little. I still reallymiss dad so much. - I'm here for you. I'll talk to you later. Bye. - Rivka, we miss you somuch at the synagogue. - I'll be back. I've just got to go totheir synagogue for now. I think they'retrying to help me. Just kind of intheir own way. - Their own way doesn'tseem very fair to me. I want you to be bat mitzvahedat adat yeshua with us. It's where you belong. - It will be okay, Karyn. Did you tell her about whathappened the other day? About Nicky and his friends? - Who's Nicky? - No, I didn't. I didn't get a chance, it's been so crazy. - What happened? Tell me what happened. - Well, there's this guy attheir synagogue named Nicky, and I admit he'sreally cute. - hey, there he is. Nicky! Nicky! Hey? what brings you here? - Well, these are myfriends from adat yeshua, rhena and Karyn. - Karyn with a y. I get it, instead of with an e. I'm learning alot about names. Yeshua is Jesus. - Karyn is with a y. Well, this is jeffkushner with a k. And Sarah's backthere catching up. - Are you joking or what? Because if you'rejoking, it's not funny. - I'm observing, Andi'm learning, seriously. - Well, Rivka here istelling us she's having her bat mitzvah atyour synagogue. - Wow! I guess you'll start bystudying with Dr. pozner? - Well, I've actuallyalready started studying at adat yeshua. - Well, you might havesome catching up to do? - What do you mean? - I don't know. I'm just saying that thereare probably some things that you haven't covered. - What she hasn't coveredat adat yeshua can stay uncovered! - Okay, I'm sure that's true. Well... ummmm. We probably oughtto get going, so I'll see y'all soon. - that was rude! - Sorry. I guess he just got to mewith his little "jokes" or whatever they are. I don't know if itrust him, Rivka. - I don't know... He seems okay to me. - He is just too cute. Nicky with a "y". - Is that allyou think about? - So? - I found thisunder her mattress. - So, it was in the box. We knew she had it. - That's notwhat bothers me. - So what bothers you? - She feels likeshe has to hide it. - Do you blame her? We don't believe inthe new testament here. - It's not good for her tofeel like she has to hide things from us when shejust lost her father. - Okay, psychologist. I'm listening. - I feel we should tell hershe doesn't have to hide it. - Do we have to? Can't we just leavewell enough alone? - Do you want her feelinglike she has to hide things around us? Maybe some day she'llfeel like she has to hide something else, like drugs or something elselike a boyfriend. She shouldn't feel like shehas to keep any secrets. - Okay. okay. That'sa good point. But I think it would bea good idea for her to speak to rabbi Stein. - We can't force her. - Of course we can't forceher, but we can ask her. - We can do that. I can do that. You stay out of it, please. - It would be my pleasure, but I still think sheshould talk to him. - He obviously likes Rivka. - That is not true! And anyway, myfather just died. - What does thathave to do with it? - It's kind of... Well, it's kind ofa Hamlet thing. - What? - You guys want to come over? I want you guys tocome over and brighten things up for me. - I'm sorry. I can't. I got to go do some choresmy mom asked me to do. - Me either. I'vegot homework. Ten page paperdue by tomorrow. - Okay. I understand. Abandon your friendfor trivial activity. You're beinga Jewish mother. - Somebody aroundhere has to be. - Love you. - Me too. - you surprised me. - You surprised me too. That. - Aunt Jackie, do youalways make a habit of going through my things? - I was changing thesheets on your bed, honey. I happened to see it there. I wanted you to know... - I see. Well, if it's a problem, I can live with somefriends of mine. - You don't understand. - I understand. I'm sure you don't like mehaving this in your house. - No. I put it on the tableso you would know you don't have to hide it. I don't want you to feel you have to hide anythingaround us. I appreciate that, but I think it would be betterif I made my own bed. - Okay. you canmake your own bed and put your oldsheets in the hall. - Thank you for understanding, aunt Jackie. I'll take my Bible now. Unless you wantto borrow it. - No, that's okay. I read parts of the newtestament in college. Thanks anyway. - You think you know what'sin the new covenant just because you read a fewverses in college? You don't even know. You want me toget rid of it? Here. - Stop! - Sidney. - You're goingto see the rabbi. I promised my brotherseven years ago that we would take you inin case anything happened. Then he got into... Into, into this jesusmishegoss, to each his own. Now we're still gladto have you here, but it won't hurt youto see the rabbi. You are going toour synagogue. - Sidney, calm down. - I am calm. I'm justpolitely insisting. You know what? I'll even go with you. - No thanks. That's worse. - Rabbi cohn, couldyou please pray for me? I'm about to gosee rabbi Stein, and I have no ideahow it's going to go. I'm a little nervous. - I have suchconfidence in you. Let me just say iknow rabbi Stein. He's a nice man. You know who you areand what you believe. I'm sure rabbi Stein isreally sensitive to what you've been through. - I didn't want to see him. I just want tobe left alone. I miss dad so much. But uncle Sidney insisted. Anyway, I'm almostto the building now. - Okay then. Let me pray. Lord god of Israel, you knowwhat Rivka's been through. You know the spirityou placed in her. It's been bruised. It's been hurt. But you tell us in Isaiah a bruised reedit wouldn't break; a smoldering wick, it would not extinguish. Go with her now intorabbi Stein's office. - Well rabbi, I'm here. - Okay, but I'm notexactly the rabbi. I just look like him. I'm just kidding. Could a good executivesecretary be of any help to you? - I think I have anappointment with the rabbi. Rivka margolis. - Yes, you do. It's righthere on my computer. He is expecting you so youcan go ahead and go on in. It's right there. - Thank you so much.- You're welcome. - Rivka. it's verynice to meet you. I'm so glad you calledfor an appointment. I've been lookingforward to this. Your aunt and unclespeak so well of you. I am so sorryabout your loss. - Thank you. - I know it's been hard. Please. Rivka, I wantyou to know that anything we discusstoday stays in this room. - Well, thank you. But no offense or anything, but I don't know if I can keep the same promise. I mean... - that's not what I mean. It's on my end. I just want you to knowthat I will keep confidence. I won't demandanything on your end. - Okay. Actually, I didn't wantto come here today. It was my unclesidney's idea. I understand. Thank you for being honest. How are you holding up? - Well, not very well. - Of course. I can'timagine the shock. You know, sometimes somecounseling can help. - I think I'll be okay. Uncle Sidney and aunt jackiehaven't mentioned anything of that sort, but I'll be okay. - I know you will, but still counselingcan help sometimes. How is it living there? - Well, they'renice and all, but I know you knowabout adat yeshua. - Yes, of course. - They found my new testamentin my bedroom and... - I understand. It's awkward. I'm sure it's awkwardfor all of you. - But I appreciate theirtaking me in and all. - Well, listen Rivka, you're a very grownup twelve year old. - Yes. Well, I thought you mightwant to know that I did have some conversationswith Nicky blavitz and some othersabout my synagogue. Yes. Nicky blavitz. I understand he introducedhimself to you. Of course I rememberwhen he was just a baby. He's growing up so fast. And he's very bright, just as you are. A very bright andcurious young man. Matter of fact, he told his parents thetwo of you had quite a talk. - Then you know. Yes, we did. I mean, well, I knowyou're the rabbi here and, well, I didn't mean tobut, but he asked all the questions and I wasn'tgoing to answer them, but... - it's okay, I understandhe asked all the questions, I'm sure he's verysharp, very inquisitive. But with you having yourbat mitzvah here so soon, maybe it would be best tohold off on those kind of religious discussions. It's just a thought. - Sure. of course. Not that I'm ashamed ofwhat I believe or anything. - No, I would notwant you to be ashamed. Your father wouldn'twant you to be. - No, he wouldn't. But as far as thebat mitzvah's concerned, I don't do too wellwith public speaking. I told rabbi cohn that, and we agreed that I'd go ahead with it, and he'd pray for me. But it may be a littleharder for me here. Yes, I understand. I'm sure Jerry helped you. That's what I call him. I don't call him rabbi. But you know what Rivka, i think it would really be good for you to haveyour bat mitzvah here. I think it would helpyou build confidence. So you'll meetwith Dr. pozner, that's the bar andbat mitzvah trainer and you'll see what you think. Fair enough? - Okay. fair enough. - Is there anythingelse you'd like to discuss with me? - I don't think so. - Well, it's been apleasure meeting you, Rivka. You're a charmingyoung lady. And I want you to know myoffice door is always open. Say hi to your aunt anduncle and give them my best. You know they'revery caring people, and they care aboutyou a great deal. - Well, I supposethat's true. - I know it's true. So let's stay in touch. - Yes, rabbi. - Okay. - Hey. How'd it go? - It was okay. Uncle Sidney, i'm a little tired. - He's a reallynice guy, isn't he? I told you hewas a nice rabbi. - Yeah. Yeah, he's nice. I'm a little tired. - How goes it? - It goes okay. - Where you going Rivka? - Going home. I've gotta leave. - Please, stay. Hey. You look terrible. - Thanks forthe compliment. - No. I mean you look upset. - Yeah, you know what? I am upset! My father just died. So I'm going home. - I know why elseyou're upset. You're not supposed to talkabout certain things with me. And I'm not supposed to ask. - That's right. I'm sure you made thatpretty clear to rabbi Stein, so let's just stayaway from each other. - Will you come back here! Listen, I just wantto say something. - Well? - It's not fair. I can ask you anythingi want, and I will. I always thought we weresupposed to ask questions. I'm always being toldjews ask questions. Well, I don'tintend to stop. - Yeah, but you don'tunderstand Nicky. I don't want to fightany big battles. I told the rabbi, I wouldn't getinto these things with you all. I guess at least untilmy bat mitzvah anyway. I'm gonna keep my word. - Hey, this isbetween us, you know? This is our business. Come on, let's sit down. I want to giveyou something. - What is it? - Open it. - It's a necklace. - It's a l'Chaim necklace. - I know that. You think I don'tknow Hebrew? - What does it mean? - It means life. - Put it on. - I can't wear this. - Rivka, I like you. Please wear it. - Please don't. - I want you to have it. - your father is Hamlet? - No. no, I mean... I don't know, i can't explain. - Please. Wear it. - I don't know. I just lost a friend. He's no longer with me. But you're here. You're alive. - I am. Just like the l'Chaim. - I could use a friend. Okay, Nicky, okay I'll wear it. - Once you putit on, Rivka, you can't take it off. This means we're together. So can I haveyour phone number? Wearing the l'Chaim meansi can call you and text you and we can go forwalks sometimes. And I'll never hurt you. - I don't know, rhena. It's his synagogue. I gotta follow the rules. - He doesn'town the people. I don't like it Rivka. You should be able toshare what you believe. - Yeah, but it's onlyuntil my bat mitzvah. That's all I promised. You know what? I want to changethe subject. Guess what happenedto me today? - I couldn't guess. - Okay. I'll tell you. Nicky gave me a necklace. - What? - You heard me. - Whateverhappened to Hamlet? - I don't know. I guess he died. And Nicky's alive, and he's nice to me. He's just a friend likeyou are only he's a boy. Not only that, he'scalling me right now. I'll talk to you later. You don't waste time. - Rivka, I had to call you. It's an emergency. - So call 911. - Not that kindof emergency. Listen, you have abouta week to sign up for the aanchaluteen Israel trip. You've got to come with us. - I don't know. My dad just died. It's a little soon. - Come on. It willbe perfect for you. Please come with us. - Um, I don't think so. - They say you can walkwhere Jesus walked. That's what they say. - Hey, don'tmake fun of me. - I'm sorry. I didn'tmean it like that. Listen, pick up a brochurefrom the synagogue and talk to your auntand uncle. It's the trip of a lifetime. Perfect for thebat mitzvah girl. - I'll consider it. Now I'm going to bed. - Who are you talking to? - Um, I'll talkto you later. I gotta go. - I don't know. This is... I don't know. - It's too far away iswhat it is Rivka, honey. I don't think you'reready for this. - I agree. - Why can't I go? Everyone else is going. - Everyone? - I don't know. Nicky and... and Sarah. - Nicky blavitz? I mean you don't have Togo to Israel to see him. You can see him right here. - Uncle Sidney, that's not the reason! Look, it will help me withmy bat mitzvah training. - Sidney, don't you thinkit's a little premature? They usually goa little older. - They're taking pre-barand bat mitzvah students to help them prepare. Look, there will be adultsthere all the time. - I hope so. Well, maybe she could learnsome judaism about judaism while she's there. Imean, it could help her. - What's thatsupposed to mean? - You know, just what I said. It means what I said. - You mean, maybe it willhave an affect on me? Maybe I'll forgetthis foolishness? Maybe I'll becomea real Jew! - Did I say that? I didn't say that. - Yes, you did! - Okay, stop it you two. - I want to go to Israel. - Okay. we'll think about it. - They have to know soon. I'm going to my room. - Teenagers... I forgot how difficultthey could be. - I thought you mightwant to see this. Thanks. Interesting. Have you seen the newguidelines for applicants to the young teenisrael tour? - No I haven't.- I have. - This one is perfect! It's you and itwill keep you cool. - You must be kidding. - If that's me, theni don't know who I am. - What do you mean? It goes perfectly witha certain necklace, if you know what I mean. - Will you please! And anyway, one look at thatshirt and he'll climb all the way up masadajust to get away from me. - I guess you're right. It's not you. I'm just jealous. I wish I were goingwith you to Israel. - I wish you guyswere going too. You guys are like mybest friends ever. - Just try it on! - Listen, we're lookingforward to having you at bene Israel next week. I need to talk toyou about something. We've got a girl herewho's a messianic. - Really? What's she doing there? - It's a long story. Well maybe you can dosomething about this girl. Get her out of this thing. - Maybe. you justmake sure she's there. I'll handle the rest. - Okay. she's pretty young. They want her to go onthis trip to Israel. - They're grabbing thempretty young these days. What about her parents. - That's a long story too. I'll fill you in laterbut she's the messianic. - Well, I'll be ready for her. Just point her out to me. Have you readthe new guidelines? - I can't say that I have. - I'll email them to you. - I'll look for them. Well, I justwanted you to know. - I love helpingrabbis like Stein out. Half the time theyhaven't a clue what to do. I'll see you next week. - Okay. - Jackie! Jackie! Yeah? who is it? Shuster, what is it? I'm busy. Tonight? what for? Yeah, yeah she's alreadyregistered for the trip. All right, all right. We'll be there. 7 P.M. Jackie, guess what? Okay shuster, where's thesheet with the instructions with the name tagson the under wear? - Sit down, Sidney. All right everyone, let's get started. Is everyone here? - We're here. - Before we start handingout the trip materials, we need to deal withsome preliminary issues. First order of business, rivka margolis. - What are youtalking about? - Let me saysomething, Alan. - Go right ahead rabbi. - Alan, please. Folks, it's come to ourattention that a certain stipulation has been addedto the registration form. However, under thepresent circumstances in Rivka's life... - wait a minute. - Let him finish. Stop interrupting. - Due to the circumstancesin Rivka's life, I really believe we shouldask for an exception. - What? No way is she going with mynicky or any of these kids! - What are youtalking about? - Why don't youread the whole thing. - Okay, okay. I will. Just give me a minute. It says no youth shall bepermitted to participate in the tour who is affiliatedwith messianic judaism, Jews for Jesus, or jewishchristianity and so forth. - Well I agreewith the rabbi. And my daughter sarahwants her to go and so do I. The girl justlost her father. This isn't right. She should go. - We have tofollow the rules. - Let the rabbi speak. - Thank you, Jackie. These are my reasons forasking for an exception. Number one, Rivka just losther father and she needs us to be there for her. I really believe it wouldbe good for her to go to israelright now. Number two, she has assuredme that she will not proselytize any ofour young people. - Excuse me, rabbi. But it's just like thenational board says right in that piece of paper. She's beyond the paleof the Jewish community. And by the way, she didproselytize my son. - She simply answeredquestions from your son. - Get off my niece'scase, blavitz. - She missionized just likeyour brother, margolis. - Leave my brother out of it. - Please, let's be reasonable. The last thing this childneeds right now is this kind of rejection anddisappointment. I really believe thenational board will agree with me on this. - I'm the president of thissynagogue and as such I must make the final decision forthe good of all concerns. In addition to thenew application, we have the anti missionarycoming next week. How can we have him speakto us on this very issue and then allow her to takenational board funds and go on this trip. That doesn't make any sense. - Wait a minute, shouldn'tthere be some kind of vote? - No. this is nota voting matter. Not in this case. It's a rules andguidelines matter. The bat mitzvahis one thing. That's a synagogue issue. This is a national board issue and it involvesnational board funds. With all due respect, rabbi. - Look I disagree, butif that's the decision, then it's... - who's gonna tell her? I'm sure not gonna tell her. - You sure are gonna tell her. She's your niece. Or she can findout in a letter. - Let's go, Jackie. And this is wherei pay my dues. - It's not about you, Sidney! It's about the rules. And Rivka's beliefs. - Then it's about me. She's living in my house. She's my niece, my family. She's almost mydaughter now. - Who are you to say shecan't go on this trip? Let's go, Jackie. - Can you believe those... - you better think beforeyou walk in that house. She doesn't needto know now. - That's true. - You're upset. - I'm not upset. I'm not. All right. You'redang right, I'm upset. - Please think. - I'm thinking. - Well? how'd the meeting go? - Okay. It went okay. - Well, I actually... i mean. - Sidney. - Actually, it was horrible. - What do you mean? My goodness. - You're not going. I tried. The rabbi tried. But it's a new ruleabout messianics. And blavitz. - Nicky's father? - He insisted. - Well, why did he do that? And how could they allmake that decision. - It's complicated, honey. This man, the president, made the final decision. I'm sorry. - I'm nevergoing back there. I don't want to havemy bat mitzvah there. I'm not gonnahave it anywhere. I don't want to goback and stand in front of all those people anyway. How could they be so mean? - It's justthese new rules. It's about national boardmoney. It's complicated. - I wish I neverwent there. I wish it wasn't here. I hate it here! Brother. I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna hearthat anti missionary, no matter whathe has to say. Not after this. Everybody willbe staring at me. - So what? - I don't carewhat blavitz thinks. I care what I might do. I've had enoughof it after this. - hello? - Did you hear? - I heard. Rivka, if you're not going, i'm not going. That's all there is to it. - I can't believe yourdad did what he did. He hates me. - I don't think so. He doesn't know you. If he knew you, he'd feel like I do. Remember the necklace. - You can't stay back. - Rivka, if you're not going, i'm not going. I don't know how I'll tellmy parents, but I will. - I don't know, Nicky. - listen to me, my name is Adam learner. I only have a few minutesbefore he comes. Please listen. - What's going on here? - Don't listento yosi Cohen. I am a completed jewin Jesus. He died for my sins. He's my Messiah. He can be your Messiah tooif you just accept him. Isaiah said he'd bewounded for our sins. Micah said... - stop! He's good, isn't he? Take a bow, Adam. Tell them about yourself. - Well, I was born toa good Jewish family in Maryland. I was having some troublein college, you know, failing thiscourse and that, partying a little too much. Well, I saw these seeminglyvery nice people at a table in the student center. They said they weremessianic Jews, and they hadall the answers. I was with themfor about a year until... Until Dr. Cohen rescued me. Baruch hashem. Now I'm a real Jew. I've made teshuvah. They're all really justchristians any ways. That's what they are. No longer Jewish. And they do these thingslike speaking in tongues and they drink. - Thank you, Adam. You can take a seat. Let's give Adam a hand. He works for ourorganization now. - Ladies and gentlemen, there are many young Jews like Adam who arebeing deceived, duped, sucked into thischristian cult. - That's telling them! Where's Sidney? - They spin their web without of context verses from our holy tanakh, the Jewish scripture. For example, the passagethat Adam cited, Isaiah 53, is a passagethat they often site. Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I find it offensive thatthey use that chapter, a chapter which describesthe sufferings of the Jewish people at the hands ofthe very christians who misinterpret itto be about Jesus. I know what they teach. You say that rabbisonce taught it was about a suffering Messiah. What's it really about? It's about Jews being gatheredtogether in synagogues which were then torched whilechristians march around them singing Christ we adore thee. Jews recite shema, Israel, there is only one god while dying in agony and pain. And these christians, these so-called messianic Jews rip these verses out of context like they're ripping outsomebody's heart. And you will learn tonighthow these people are being brainwashed by the deceptivemessianic missionaries. You will learn how toguard against their lies. Young people, beware. Their target is you. Rabbi, the ushershave the packets? - Yes. Yes of course. - Nicky, I was wonderinghow the meeting went and what's going on with Israel. Please give me a call. - No answer yet? Not good. - I've been leavingmessages for two days now and nothing. Why won't he call me? He's my only friend. Besides you and Karen. - Well, maybehe's grounded. Maybe he can'tuse his phone. - Yeah. yeah, i'm sure that's it. He told his parentshe's not going to Israel and they probably tookhis phone away. - It makes sense to me. - It's him! He's texting me! - What's it say? - I can't see you anymore. Can't explain more now. Sorry. He'll be sorry. He doesn't evenknow what sorry is. - Ouch. that must hurt. - More than you know. - Excuse me. I wantthe blavitz' address. - Well we don't... - where's the rabbi? I want to speak to him. - Well, you can't just... is he here? - Rivka, I've beenmeaning to talk to you. - I want the blavitz'address and she won't give it to me. I don't want anything else. That's all I want. - Please just come intomy office so we can talk. - No! I just want the address. - All right, i can give it to you. Although we don'tusually do that, but I'm sure it's important. So Doris, please give herthe blavitz' street address. But when you're calmer, i would really like you to come to my office, I want to share my heartwith you about some decisions. - Show some respectyoung lady. - When I'm respected, i'll show some respect. - How dare you speak toyour elders and especially the rabbi that way. You apologize now. - I'm very sorry. It won't happenagain because I'm never coming back, ever! - I'm reallysorry to hear that. That's a shame. Dr. pozner over there is thebar and bat mitzvah trainer. He's a veryknowledgeable man. Among other things, he's also a very nice person. And I was really hopingthe two of you would meet. - I'm sure there's a lothe wants to teach me. But unfortunately, i won't be around. I better get going. - Goodbye, Rivka. - Goodbye, rabbi. - She's an insolent child. - She's deeply hurtand in great pain. Can you blame her? - Well I guess that's whyyou're the rabbi and I'm not. - A lot of pain, right Eric. - I would say so, rabbi. - After all, you are atherapist among other things. - Rabbi Stein. I've gotyosi Cohen on the phone. Could you give us a minuteto talk about this situation. - Yes. excuse me. Sure. - Rabbi Stein, I thought wecould enlist yosi's help with this Rivka girl. Yosi, we just turneddown her application for the tour becauseshe's a messianic. - Really? and her parents? - They're both dead. She's staying withher aunt and uncle, members in goodstanding here. - I see. - What's your point, Alan? - Rabbi, I think thisgirl needs a visit. - You give meone hour with her, and I'll have her denyingeverything the missionariesever taught her. - Are you crazy, Alan? In the first place, she justgot through telling me she's never stepping footin this synagogue again. - What's thatgot to do with it? We're dealing with ayoung Jewish soul here. - He's right, rabbi. - No, he's not right. He's wrong. We say young peopleshould not be pressured into the messianic faith. We would be guiltyof the same thing. Leave this poor girl alone! She's been through enough. This meeting is over! Over! - Sorry. Maybe we can vote him outnext year when his contract is up. In the meantime, we can't visit a member's home without his permission. At least not this one. - Well, at least her auntand uncle know how to get in touch with me. Shalom, friend. - Shalom, yosi. - Nicky's not home, Rivka. - I don't believe you. - Don't press me. He's not home. - It's okay, dad. - What are youdoing, Nicky? - I have something for him. Come out here. - I'll be inside. Don't take too long. - He won't. What's going on? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Rivka. My parents. They don't wantme to see you. - I thought you weregoing to stand up to them? What about the necklace? The l'Chaim? - Shhhh. - Was it that stupidanti missionary? - I don't know. Not really. It's just some of what he saidseemed to really make sense. - Yeah? Well there isn't goingto be a bat mitzvah now. I can straighten outanything he said. I can answer allyour questions now. - I don't know. I didn't understand mostof what he was saying. Look, I'm sure you're sincerein believing all these things about Isaiah, Micah, all the other 's and maybe you're right. But maybe he's right. I don't know. But you were rightabout one thing. I gotta do whatmy parents say. I gotta go to Israel. And you can't go. - So who's stoppingyou from going? Did I tell you youcouldn't go to Israel? Am I stopping you? But I thought we were friends. I thought you'd alwaysbe there for me. Were they just words? - I can't, Rivka. I just can't. Things are too complicated nowwith all the other kids and... - I can't believe youcare what they think? Then here. - You broke the chain. - You broke your promise. - Rivka. Rivka? - It's you. From the synagogue. - I need to talkto you, Rivka. - I don't know you and i'mnot supposed to talk to men who call me from cars. - Please. you don't understand. - I'll scream. - No. wait. Meet me in the coffeeshop over there. - Why should I? - I want to talkabout your bat mitzvah. Please. - There's nothingto talk about. I'm not having it. - I think there issomething to talk about. I knew your father. - You were friendswith my father? - Martin margolis. We were friends. - All right. I have 15 minutes. That's all. - It's a deal. - You knew my dad? - Yes. Here. He gave this to me. - Wow. This book meant a lot to dad. - He liked the fact thatthe author asked questions. That's a very Jewish thing. - So I've heard. - Rivka, I must tell youthat your father came to me for counseling after ruthie, your mother passed. Naturally he was depressedand he was trying to be a good father to you. And he felt heneeded some help. - Counseling? I thought you were a barand bat mitzvah teacher at the synagogue. - Well, it doesn'tpay all the bills. I'm a therapist as well. - I see. Did rabbi Stein ask youto counsel me? - No. I'm here because I wantto be your friend. - I've had enoughfriends from banai Israel. - Let me explain. Since I was able to give yourfather some help so that he could be a wise father to you, i feel I have a bit of a stake in your life so to speak. You do? - I could never replace him. But I'm here becausei care about you. - Well, I appreciate thatbut, Mr.... - doctor. doctor poznerbut please call me Eric. - Okay. Eric, my father and I had a veryprecious relationship with god and I know you want to helpbut I just don't know if you could relate to that. No offense. So if you don't mind... - try me. - What do you mean? I mean you eitherunderstand or you don't. - Well, I thinki do understand. I understand enoughto ask questions. Questions like how a jewcould be a Buddhist or a new age or even an atheistand still be Jewish. But a messianic Jew is notsupposed to be Jewish anymore. Your father to helped meto ask that question. And I think I know the answer. If Jesus was Jewish, thenyour father was Jewish too. And I don't know too many peoplemore Jewish inside and out than your father. And such Jewish answers, answered he lived by. For instance, one thing heused to say was a prudent man. - Overlooks an insult. - Yes, that's right! Rivka, let meget to the point. I don't know you very wellbut I believe what was special in your father is in youin special ways. I'm not just stalk talkingabout what you believe but how you believe it. If your father were sittingwith us here right now I think he'd say I knowyou're hurting, I know you're sad, i know you're angry and you have every right to be. And I know you're disappointed by the people that havelet you down. But a prudent young womanwho overlooks an in result would have her bat mitzvahat banai Israel and study with her father'sfriend Eric who loved her fatherand cares about her. Rivka, I believe part of youwill always regret not having your bat mitzvah. And I want tohelp you have it. - Well, thank youfor wanting to help but there's something else. You see, I don't like standingup in front of people. I tend to avoid it. And with all those parents thatdidn't want me going on the trip i just can't do it. Rabbi Cohen had to convince meto do it at adat yeshua. But I don't think you can. So I've made up my mind. - I can understand that. May I ask you onequestion before you go? - Yes. - Are you familiarwith Elijah's flight from jezebel's threats? - Yes. 1 kings 19, I think I knowwhere you're going with this. It's not about that. I'm not running away. - Isn't it? - Look, I just can't. - Do you remember what madethe difference for Elijah? - I don't know. The thing thathappened in the cave? I'm not in a cave. Look, it's been 15 minutes. I've got to go. - It was the soundof the spirit. It wasn't in the wind. It wasn't in the earthquake. There's a lot of windaround you, Rivka. A lot of earth shakingthings have happened. All I'm asking is that you getquiet enough to hear the sound of the spirit about it. What would your father want? - I know what he'd want. He told me how muchhe was looking forward to my bat mitzvahand how proud he'd be. And now just like mymother he won't be there. - He'll know. And god will know. - Well, maybe god knowsi shouldn't have it. Maybe that's the best thing. - I have enough confidencein your father's faith, in your faith to know you'll getan answer to that question. we've been soworried about you. - Both of us. We're so glad you're home. - The rabbi called. He said you saw himand seemed upset. Are you okay? - I think so. - It's okay aboutthe bat mitzvah. - The most important thingis that you're okay. - Uncle Sydney, aunt Jackie, i... sometimes I haven't been very grateful forwhat you've given me. I mean... i mean thank you. Thanks for being there. - Honey, you lostboth your parents. Anyone would beupset about that. I mean anyone. - Uncle Sydney, you'rea big Teddy bear. That's what you are. - Well, I... let's sit down. - Listen, I think I might needa little time to be alone. You know, some timeto be by myself. Maybe in my room. Maybe on long walks. And I may not want anythingto eat for a little while. - What do you meana little while? - I don't know. A few days. I don't know. - You have to eat, Rivka. You're a growing girl. There's a time and a place. Yom kippur maybe. You'll get sick. Is it that you're depressed? - No. no, it's not that. I'll be all right. Please trust me. It won't be long. And I'll drink juices. - That's not enough fora growing girl like you. It's just that we care and youcould land in the hospital. I mean, everybody eats. - Especially you. - Uncle Sydney, aunt Jackie, dad fasted. He knew when to drink juices and maybe even eata little sometimes. I'll be okay. - I see. You want to be just like him. That's natural. But you're young. And look what happened to him. - I don't think it hadanything to do with that. Rivka, we just wantyou to be happy. - I know you do. I'll be okay, guys. - Are you sure? You're so thin to begin withand just entering... i mean... - I'll be okay. I'll be in my room. I love you both. - Strange. - I'll tell you this ishow they act just before committing suicide. - Sydney, I don't thinkthere's any danger of that. But still it's strange. - You know, she'sours, Jackie. She's ours. I just don't wantanything to happen to her. - Honey, I'm just leaving alight meal outside your door. - Okay. thank you. Yes, what is it? - Honey, I'm just leaving alight meal outside your door. - Thank you. - Rivka! - Will you gosomewhere with me? - Where? - You'll see. You'll be home before dinner. - I've got tocall my parents. - Go ahead. - Hey, mom. I got to gosomewhere with Rivka. I'll be home later. Okay? bye. Love you, too. All right. Lead me on. - Come on. Let's go. - this is a little creepy. Going to your old housewithout telling anyone. We aren't going in, are we? Isn't that trespassing? - Just pray my old key works. - I think we can getarrested for this, Rivka. - it looks so... so empty. - Yeah. - Just as I thought. - Not even in theold bean chair. - I'm sorry. I should have asked mymom to ask your uncle. I promised I'd get it for you. - It's okay. I didn't come herefor the bean chair. - Then why did you come here? - I came to pray for wisdom. - Couldn't you do thatat your uncle's house? Hey, let's order a big pizza. I'm hungry. Let's ruin ourappetite big time. - Actually, I'm not eating. - Are you sick? - I'm fine. - Well, I'm hungry. - I just want you to be herefor a little while because you're my best friend. - I'm here but I'm sorry. I think I need to go soon. - That's okay. I think I need to be herealone for a little while. - You sure you're okay? - I'm fine. - Well... okay. I guess I'll go. You're sure you'll be okay? - I'm fine. Just pray for me. - I will. Love you. - You too. - well, here I amin my old room where mom and dad usedto tuck me into bed, only no mom, no dad and no bed. Only me. And you. So where do I start? I guess I need to beginby saying I need to hear the soundof your spirit. So should I have the bat mitzvahat banai Israel? Because all those peoplemake me so nervous. And with these people, i'd be more nervous than... than I'm tired, god. It's been a long day. And I'm hungry. I think it's what theycall low blood sugar. But you would know that. - mazel tov onyour bat mitzvah. Now, remember to eat allof your vegetables and make sure you leave roomfor some chocolate cake. - I'm stuffed. That wasn't thesound of the spirit. That was the soundof my stomach. My goodness. It's getting dark. - Rivka, where were you? We were worried sick. Are you okay? - I'm fine, aunt Jackie. Wow, rabbi Cohen, I miss thisplace and I miss your sermons and I miss you. Pod cast. It's free of course. - Yeah, but it'snot the same. - It's not the samearound here without you. We all miss you very much. I think it's good you're withyour aunt and uncle right now. You'll have yourbat mitzvah there. Don't you? - Well, that's why I'm here. I decided not to have it. But then I met doctor pozner. - Yes, Eric pozner. - He knew my father, too. - That's true. - He's an interesting man. He says he's a question asker. - So what questiondid he ask you? - Well, he askedif I would listen for the sound of the spirit about whether to havemy bat mitzvah like Elijah. - Sounds like Eric. - So I've kind of beenfasting which is freaking out my aunt and uncle. - I know how they feel. How long has it been? - A few days. - At your age you shouldeat starting today, Rivka. Are you drinking? - Yes. juices. Rabbi Cohen, I have to know whether to do my bat mitzvahor not. Of course I don't want to, but well, maybe my fatherwould want me to. - Good point. You are some amazingyoung woman, Rivka. - Tea, juice, water, lemonade. - Lemonade. - Cookie? - Um, no thanks. Um, I was thinking I mighthave my bat mitzvah. Just thinking. - The sound of the spirit. - No. Just the sound of my thinking. And I didn't say iwas going to have it. - I understand. - Do you know whenthe date would be? - Let me check for openings. Okay, there's not much openbut... here's a good one. It's on passover. From exodus. - That's very beautiful. Maybe you shoulddo the honors. You know it waybetter than I do. - As a therapist I usually letthe patient do all the work. That way they experiencethe growth. Here. try reading verse 15. - Very good. They've taught you verywell over there at adat yeshua. Please give me congratulationsto rabbi Cohen. I can make an mp3 of everythingfor you by next week. What do you think? - I didn't sayi would have it. - I can only say I canhold the date for so long. This offer is only goodfor a little while. - Give me two days. I'll know by then. - Okay. I'll hold your reservation. And I'll live if you say no. - okay. Exodus 33: 14, and he saidmy presence will go with you and I will give you rest. Then he said to him, this ismoses, if your presence does not go with us do notbring us up from here. Makes sense. I could really use yourpresence and rest right now after all I've been through. Not that I'm complainingor anything. Wait a minute. Yeah. yeah, you know what? I am complaining. I just lost my closest friendand dad and I don't like it. Listen to me, house of Jacob and all the remnantof house of Israel who have been upheldby me from birth, who have been carriedfrom the womb. Even to your old age I am he. And even to gray hairsi will carry you. I have made and I will bear. Even I will carryand will deliver you. But the lord wasnot in the wind. And after the windan earthquake. But the lord was notin the earthquake. And after earthquake, a fire. But the lord wasnot in the fire. And after the firea still small voice. The sound of the spirit. So it was when Elijah heard itthat he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entranceof the cave. Suddenly a voice came to himand said, what are you doing here, Elijah? What am I doing here? - I think you're ready. - You do? - Yes. Your father would bevery proud of you. - I'm sure he will be. - Yes, he will. Do you have your short speech? - I don't think i'mgoing to say anything. - Yes, you told me. Well, just what you'redoing speaks for itself. It takes a lot of courageto go through with it. I guess that's whythey call it a mitzvah. - I don't know ifi'd call it courage. Maybe it's the soundof the spirit, but it's definitely notmy first choice. - Then that takeseven more courage. You know what? I don't know other young personas ready to take this step as you are, Rivka. - Then why do I havesuch a stomach ache? - Well, someone as they saysweat great drops of blood after he said, not my will. Isn't that what it says? At least you'renot doing that. - Good point. I guess you reallyread the book. Well, thanks for everything. I wouldn't be doingthis without you. - yeah, just usethat same list. Eric. Come here a second. Jacob bluestein has Avery interesting idea. - Really? - Yeah. - I'm all ears. - You look sobeautiful, Rivka. If only your fatherwere here to see you. - Thanks, aunt Jackie. My mom used to do myhair just like you are. You're really good at it. - Is everything okay? - What so funny? - Well, god, this is it. I wish I wasn't doing this buti'm not even going to ask. I already know the answer. - Well, first I feeli need to tell you I almost didn't havemy bat mitzvah. I prayed a lot about it and ieven sort of forgot to eat. Actually the versesi looked at were really helpfulwith my decision. My presence will go with youand I will give you rest. It's that presence and the restthat comes with it that sustains me up here todayafter so recently losing my closest friend in the wholeworld, my dad. When I was in the park thinkingabout whether to do this, I saw a fatherand his little girl. He put her on his shoulderslike my dad used to do, and I felt... i don't knowhow to explain it. Kind of carried. Carried all the wayto this place today. So here I am. And I'm really nervous. But I think I finally learnedsomething in the hardest year of my short life. I think I've finallylearned to do what my father taught methrough proverbs, to overlook insults and focuson the good things. Good things like my auntand uncle who love me. And friends old and new whosupported me as friends should. Some new friends were kindwhen I was first here and was a strangerwho needed a friend. Thank you. And to my friends that adatyeshua including rabbi Cohen, you're all a greatcomfort to me. Thank you, rabbi Stein. I know you stood up for meduring a difficult time. And doctor pozner, Eric, you're the bestbat mitzvah teacher a girl could ask for. You gave me freedomand respect. You encouraged me to askall the right questions. As all Jews should. And then god answered me. That's why I'm here. I love you. I want to say I was kindof forced to grow up the day my dad died and some people said I wasbecoming a woman. But I know on my bat mitzvahthat in some ways I'm still a little girl, a little girl who hasa big family who cares about her. And I need all of you. Thanks to those peoplein this room and this synagogue who have shown me kindnessin so many different ways. You know, my dad and uncledidn't see each other for a very long time. And I missed out not gettingto know him and aunt Jackie. I'm so thankful they met upjust before my dad died. What if they hadn't? That would make a sadthing so much sadder. There's a verse in a bookthat I realize isn't read here but I think we'd agreeon what it has to say. My dad had me memorize itbecause he loved it so much. So here's to you, dad! I'm finally here, your youngjewish daughter of Rebecca taking her place. Love suffers long and is kind. Love does not envy. It does not parade itself, is not puffed up, does not behave rudely, is not provoked, does not seek its own, thinks no evil, does notrejoice in iniquity but rejoices in the truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. I love you all. Thank you. - You did it. I'm so proud of you! - Thanks, rhena. - Courage. Real courage. I guess you heardthe sound of the spirit. Congratulations. - Thanks. - A wonderful job. I was kvelling. - You know, I don't needto tell you how proud your father would be. And how proud I am. - Thank you. Uncle Sydney, aunt Jackie, this is my rabbi, rabbi Cohen from adat yeshua. - She did great, didn't she? - Yes. She is her father's daughter. And her uncle and aunt'sniece and a wonderful girl. - You know, rabbi, I thinkrivka needs to spend some time with her friendsat adat yeshua. Why don't you go worshipwith rabbi Cohen this weekend? - I think that'sa great idea. I'm sure everyonemisses you there. I love you guys! I know. Yeah. yeah. It was really great. - Congratulationson a great speech. Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. - Listen, I'm going tohave to call you back. Okay.okay. bye. - Congratulations on your batmitzvah, and this is for you. - Well, thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Well, I think it would bea good idea to visit your parents' graveon this special day. They would be so proud of you. - Okay, but can weget going already. - Wait. I just remembered jacobbluestein gave me a card. It's in my purse. I better put itwith the others. - Jacob bluestein? That was nice of him. - Well, throw it in the pileand we'll look at it later. It's getting dark soon. - I wonder what he gave her. - We'll find out later. - Okay. I was just curious. - I mean it doesn'thave a lock on it. It only takes asecond to open it. - The members of banai israelsynagogue have collected this money so that you can visitthe land of Israel with your uncle sydneyand aunt Jackie. I know you will appreciate itmore than many girls your age. Love, your familyat banai Israel. Look at all those zeros! - We've never been to Israel. I can't believe we're going. It's a blessing.
