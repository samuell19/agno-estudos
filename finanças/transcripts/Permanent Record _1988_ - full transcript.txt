Kick it in the ass. - You want to write the lyrics? - No. i dont want to write them. Ok then, I just want them to be perfect. Yeah? Well,... let me inspire you. Whoo! Whoo! Whoa! Shit! I love to drive. You are lame. Too fast for you? They made the car. Really, I like it when you drive 'cause I can catch up on a little sleep. Damn it. Follow my lead, okay? Go right ahead. I can't wait to see this. Uh, hi. Um... my brother's recording here on the fifth floor. Third. Oh, yeah. Thanks. Here is security, is talent expecting his brother? Out of here?

Have a seat. What I have in my hand is going to make a lot of people feel very proud. The Atkinson School of Music, David. Congratulations. Oh. So you're saying I got in. Yes. You and only 17 others out of 200 applicants. Wow. I don't believe it. It proves the talent's there. Yeah, um... Wow.... I don't know. The Atkinson Academy. David, aren't you happy to hear about this? Huh? Oh, yeah. No. Yeah, I am. It's... When do I have to let them know? The next few weeks. There's plenty of time. Why? No reason. It's just... I can't do this right now. What? Well, maybe... you know, we could postpone it for a year or something. This is the opportunity you've been shooting for. What's the matter with you? What's the big deal? Why can't everybody just get off my back? All I'm saying is I don't want to do this right now. You know, it's just... I need a break. Can't you understand that? I need time off. I've got so much to do. My homework and the band. I've got this Pinafore thing and now this on top of it. No way, I can't do it. It's too many things at once. David. David, relax. Atkinson's isn't until next year. Uh, yeah. Right. Next year. Duh! I'm so stupid. Uh...that's great. Oh, sorry about that. It just got out of my mind. Thank you, Mr. Verdell. Don't thank me. You did the work. Yeah. Wow. Atkinson, huh? It's amazing. Whoo! He works at a motorcycle shop at the beach. How do you know? If I tell you, I'll die. Come on. Tell me. I followed him. In your car? I didn't follow him on foot. He was on a motorcycle. But there's something else. He's old. You mean, like... Say, 23 maybe. Is that too much? No, no. 25 is too much. You want to show me that? What was that? Ok. Remember, you slide up to the fourths the second time around. You got it? No. Just try it. Hi. Hi. You guys going to make out all day, or can we get a five-minute lesson in here? ... Please. Thank you. Make out? Who brought the beer? Nobody. Let's get into a little three-chord progression. ♪ Dah dee dee Anybody can play chords. I'm teaching you music. That's what you pay me for. I don't pay you. - Can you transpose this on sight? - No. - Why not? - You're driving me too hard. My mom left long time ago. You can't take her place. Great. Play it again. I can't. I wasn't looking at my hands. Bonehead. What's going on, men? Beer! Yo, lads. Gentlemen, we got a studio. We record on the 23rd. I got us a half-price deal. Can't do better than that. - We're not ready,... - Sure we are. not if we're recording the song I'm writing. It's not finished. So finish it. Look, let Chris finish the song. Right. Seriously. You can write. You should write more. You could be the lead singer of this band, too. You said you were going to write the song first we record. You said that about 25 years ago. So, we're asking you to do what you said. You want to let us down. Great. We don't need you for that. Anybody on the street can let us down. We're counting on you. All right, let's go. She is on my mind. 1, 2, 3, 4. I said there are those who know and those who don't. And? And I tried to hit the son of a bitch. Nobody sticks together anymore. You notice that? You'd think they would. Yeah, I know. I think, um... School's like a whatchamacallit thing for the whole world. Microcosm? Yeah, one of those. I better get going before your mom gets home. Know why we have such a great thing? Is it great? Yeah. Why? It's because we don't say anything. Have I ever asked you a question? Have you ever asked me a question? No. Exactly. We see each other on the sly every once in a while. No one asks any questions, and there you have it. Yeah. I guess. I wonder if we're normal, because most people who do what me and you do would be going together. Well, at least we don't cheat on each other, right? Right. Bye. Bye. Hey, kid. Hi. What are you doing? Playing. Playing what? Spaceships. Spaceships, huh? I used to build medieval castles here. And on that wall, I used to draw these huge crayon monsters. And then I'd build these pillow forts over there. To hide from the crayon monsters? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah... Wow, this is a good room. And this is a great bed. I love this bed. Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we trade places? I'll sleep in your bed tonight. You can sleep in mine. Yeah. Then you can get up in the morning and go to school in my place. And then you can get the good grades and the girl. Yuck! Yuck? Why yuck? It will be great. You'll have a great time, and I'll get a chance to sleep all day. Ahh! I could sleep in this bed forever. David? David? Aah! I'm the crayon monster! I'm going to eat you up! That was a beautiful melody, Chris. Yeah, well... Don't make a big deal out of it. I think music is going to be your future. I really believe it. Trying to graduate's is my future, getting out of this school with my ass. That will happen, but I keep thinking about down the road. You exude sex. Chris, this is serious. Stop pedaling so fast. Coast a while. Coast? I didn't even get into the school I was counting on. This is no time to coast. Okay, people, let's get organized. Quiet, please! I want all the sailors on the stage. All right, quiet! Okay. Ladies, sit down... I can't believe you're arranging the whole thing. It's a piece of cake. You just have to know everybody's range and what instruments to play and what key they're supposed to be in. Yeah, you're right. It's a lot of work. Hey, Jake! Come here. Hi, David. You should be conducting the orchestra. Me, conduct your arrangement? Yeah. But I'm assisting him. I'm the assistant director. Jake, anybody can do that. You should be conducting. You just go up and down with the rhythm, then the cue will come... Shit! You drive like a maniac. Don't needle me. I'm all nervous about tonight. I've never given a party, bevore I don't really know what to do. Just be wild. I can do that. Wild, huh? Yeah, it's you. It's easy. M.G.! Where are you? Ah! Light of my life. Beacon of hope. What are those? Chris, they're vegetables. We don't want vegetables. We want booze. What do we want? Uh, garbage. Yes! We want trash. We want pizza, we want chips... We want cucumbers, we want carrots. We want beets. Beets? People eat beets. Beets. David! Any chance of getting that music turned down? What music? It's happened. You're deaf. ♪ 'Cause I said so ♪ 'Cause I said so Ma. Yeah. Nothing. - You want to dance? - No. You can come to that party with me. No. Come on. No, that's enough. David? What? Um... how's Kim? She's okay. I guess you'll take her to that party, huh? I don't know who I'm taking. Well... Plate of spaghetti? I'll be down in a second. Hey, Nickeroo. Hi. You made your bed. Yeah. Hey. Hi. Hi. You want a beer? No. Do you have any problems with grades, David? Uh, that's a question. I guess it is. No questions, right? See, I'm having this problem. I might not graduate. How would that be for humiliation, huh? And this fool just asked me to marry him. Not too bright, huh? Who wants to marry a girl who can't even graduate high school? I'll catch you later. David. When will I see you? I don't know. Catch you later. What's the matter? Nothing. Give it a shot. Hi, David. Hey, you got a light? No, I don't. Sorry. Hey. Hey. Looks good. - It's okay? - Yeah. Hello. I didn't think you'd come. I got held up at work. Nobody showed, huh? No,... nobody showed up. Where are you going? Uh...for a walk. You want some company? Okay. I'm sorry. - I didn't mean to... - That's okay. I didn't mean it like... No...take it easy. I'll see you later. Let's rock 'n' roll! Hey! David! David! David! David! David! Ohh! Suffer the little children to come unto me, for of them is the kingdom of heaven. My own brother was killed when I was a boy, and I never forgot that deep sense of loss I felt. But man that is born of woman hath but a short life to live. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower. Accidents like this happen. We don't know why. David... ... an accident has taken your life. Why? We will ask this and other questions, but where will we find the answers, the reasons, the strength to cope with your loss? Hey, Lauren. Lauren? Do you think his spirit is here? Maybe. Doesn't the spirit or the soul or aura linger at the place of death? You mean like when somebody dies before his time or something? Yes... In an accident like this or violently or something. It's not fair. That fucking service. Maybe we should do something on our own, like have a remembrance or something. Something to say good-bye. Impossible! Yes, it's true. Too true. A common sailor? Oh, fie! Okay. Fine. All right. Quiet, backstage! Let's take it from the duet. Jake, what happened to your head? It's still here. Okay! On to the duet! No. Uh... Right after that, sailors, relatives, and Ray. That's you, Chris. Mrs. DePaul, do you know where we are? Hey, Ray. What's this? If you'd worked on your part, you'd know. I've been meaning to. It's just I've been a little distracted, I guess. This production is going on with you or without you, Chris. You decide. We can't afford to let you hold everybody else back. I didn't know I was doing that. Excuse me? I didn't know I was doing that. Okay, gang. We're going to cut it short today. You can knock off. Trouble in River City? I don't know. Motivation problem, I guess. Who's going to finish the musical charts? Jake. How about Chris? He has no training. Let's give him the shot. I don't think that's such a good idea. Let's give him the shot anyway. Chris. Excuse me. The charts have to be finished. You're the best person for the job. What do you think? Um... I don't know music like David did, Mr. Verdell. We're talking, uh... A big job. Stretch yourself. "Chris, I wanted everything to be perfect. "It wasn't. David." So with involution, one raises the base to a power. What is evolution? The extraction of a root. The problems on pages 213 and 214 are excellent examples. I'd like you to review those for class. Hi. Tracked you down. I guess so. But I wish you hadn't. Don't you need me? I don't know what I need. I really don't. Um... Except to be alone. You can go. I won't follow. I lied. Who doesn't? I've got a surprise. I'm not in the mood, M.G. I'm writing about it. About what? David's death. What do you even know about it? Like the last couple of days of his life. Make sense, will you? I'm putting myself in his place the last couple of days of his life, what he was thinking about. - Don't make me laugh. - I am not trying to... I'm just telling you. I'm going to get it published in the paper. They want to print lies? Not lies. Thoughts. These are true thoughts. What truth? Mine! The way I honestly feel about it. Other people have people that died, too. Maybe I can help them. It might. Why do you always stifle me? You always do this. Put on the brakes. Coast. Well, I can't coast. Is this it? Well, it's shit, okay? It's crap! You don't know a rat's ass about what he was thinking. That makes this a bunch of fucking lies! Shit! Fuck! I'm sorry. Get away from me. Get away from me. Is your mother here? Yeah. Could you get her for me, please? Okay. Hi, uglies. Looking for my brother? Not exactly, Nick. I'm just looking. He died. Um... Nick, on second thought, you want to tell your mom I'll come back later? Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi. What do you say, dad? Okay, everybody. Listen up. We're here to plan a memorial service for David. So... Does anyone have any suggestions? Chris? I don't have any suggestions. Sorry. I'm not even sure anymore if this is such a good idea. What? The guy's gone. What will we accomplish by putting ourselves through this? Chris... What is it? Nothing. Nothing? Chris, talk to me. M.G., please. Just... Just nothing. There was an accident. It happened. But now we've got to go on. We get up onstage. We say some words. We play his music. Bang, it's over. Good. It's very thoughtful of you. Your best friend in the world. He'd understand. He wasn't very thoughtful either. How can you say that? Because my best friend in the world... killed himself, M.G. He jumped. What? He jumped. No accident. How do you know? This. He mails it to me, then he takes a leap. He couldn't take it, and some perverted joke, he lays this big knowledge on me. God. This doesn't really prove that... Um... There was no sound. What? Um... He didn't scream. Uh...I didn't know if I should tell you or anybody. I don't know if I did the right thing. He should have screamed. I would have screamed. Wouldn't you? Hi. How did you know I was here? I didn't. How did you get here? Bus. Then hoofed it. I didn't know you drink. I didn't know I drink either. He said he was going for a walk. Brother, did he ever. I thought the party was too loud. I didn't know. I guess there's a lot of things we didn't know... and never will. Honest answer. You ever think about suicide? Honest? Hell, no. I'm having too much fun, Lauren. I mean, uh... This trip through space and time is going to be over on its own soon enough. It doesn't need any help from me. I came into this thing screaming and kicking. I'm going out the same way. I thought we all thought about...you know. Screw it. Now, why David did it... I've thought about that. And like you said... We'll never know. You said that. Yeah. What happens when you die? I used to dream... Daydream, you know? You know... Of David being a rock star, and me hanging out with him. And maybe I was even dating this one guy, and he'd pick me up on his motorcycle and drop me off at David's 'cause, see, he'd understand that David and I were good friends. He'd understand that. And the house had this huge fence around it, and there was always kids hanging around for a glimpse. Sometimes... David would be playing, and I'd be singing with him at the piano. Where was I? Outside the fence signing autographs? Was there something I could've done? You want some advice? Don't ask yourself that. I know, because I tried. And there ain't no answer. What are you doing? Hey, Lauren, get back. I'm okay. I just want to know the feeling. Lauren, get back! Now! How could you? You bastard! No playing around. No teasing or tempting the fates, get it? Not with me here, you don't! And there's no figuring it out. He blew it! That's all! We will never know. It's too late... Right? God damn right. Come on. We'd like to have the service here at school. Um... David wasn't happy with most of the stuff he wrote, but... there's one song I know he wouldn't mind if we played. Singing? No. Uh... He'd only written a few words to it. He wasn't really happy with it. Okay. I'll clear a date. Thank you very much, sir. T-R-I-G. T-R-I-- What are you going to do? Just proving a point. I can't even spell trigonometry. I can spell it. I can teach you. No, Jake. It's okay. Relax. We're having this service for David. Yeah? We'll play his music and try to make a good time out of it. Verdell's setting it up. I don't know. You don't know what? You used to want to help me. Well, I still do. Okay, so help now. What I mean is... This guy kills himself. I don't know. What the fuck's the difference? The guy's gone. Let's say good-bye to him. Okay. Yeah. Do you ever wonder... I mean, if David couldn't make it... I don't know. Hello, Leo. - Dr. Moss. How are you? - Fine, thanks. - How is family? - Fine thank you. Have a seat, Leo. Leo, I was in New York last month on school business, and I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge. I was scared to death. I had to hold on for dear life. How are your students handling it, Leo? They don't get it. He seemed to have everything going for him, and then this. It scares them. They want to know why. They're afraid it might happen to them. And then they realized... They didn't really know him. Hell, I thought I knew him. When he came into my office just the other day... I sensed something. But I thought he was just nervous over college like everyone else. If he'd only told me. Maybe he tried. Maybe that was his problem. He just couldn't. I hope we can make them understand sometimes we never know why these things happen. Can you get them refocused over there, get them back on track? They're planning a memorial service for him. Wait, Leo. That's not such a good idea. I think it's a very good idea. They'll play his music. His music? What are you talking about? Let's not make a hero out of this boy. We don't want to canonize him and make it look like we're condoning his suicide. That's horseshit, Leo. I already told them I'd set it up. Well, you tell them to read the small print. Good to see you, Leo. See you, Lauren. Well, you want to get out or what? I don't want to go to work tonight. So don't. What will happen if you don't? Nothing... If she's ill. Tell them it's highly contagious. Tell them you got 2 billion germs ready to jump into the lemon chicken. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Oh, ... you're a good guy. Shh! Don't ever, ever say that. Oh... You know that article you're writing for the paper? Forget about that. That's gone. You might have been right. No, that was an idea never should have been born. Well... Especially since it wasn't even an accident. More the reason maybe to write it, huh? 5, 6, 7, 8. ♪ Bum bum bum bum, Bum bum bum bum ♪ We sail the ocean blue ♪ And our saucy ship's a beauty ♪ We are sober men and true ♪ And attentive to our duty ♪ When the balls whistle free o'er the bright blue sea ♪ We stand to our guns all day ♪ When at anchor we ride on the Portsmouth's tide ♪ With plenty of time for play Okay, okay, okay, sailor's chorus over here.

It occurred to me, if anybody might know something, it might be you. About what? David. I don't know anything about why he killed himself, if that's what you think. No, no. I'm asking you to think. What did he talk about? Nothing. What did he say? Nothing was said. No questions, no nothing. Well, he must have said something. It was just sex, Chris. That's all it was. I'm sorry I can't help you. We're having a service for him. Maybe you'd like to say a few words. No, I wouldn't. Why not, Kim? Because it's just not the kind of thing I do, Chris. I'm sorry. I just have nothing to say. Excuse me. Excuse me. Chris... Everyone. We can't hold this memorial service for David Sinclair. No. No, you promised. Well, it can't happen, so you'll have to forget about it. You said you'd help. I know what I said, Chris. Now I'm saying we can't do it. Why not, Mr. Verdell? Look, everyone. This comes from the top. That's it. This gives us real respect for authority. That's enough. No, it's not enough. We want to do this! I telling you we can't. Bullshit, man! This is bullshit! Hey! Get in my office. Now! Sit down, Christopher. I don't appreciate backtalk in front of half the damn senior class. I don't appreciate you going back on your word. This is how the world is. Things change. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sure. Hey... you want to pick that up? Yeah, I want to pick it up. Chris. How could you do this? It's all I got. How else can I get through to you? You can't get kicked out of school and expect everything to be okay. Well, could you not leave? Could you stick around? Can we talk? I need my guitar. That guitar is not your future. You won't even have a diploma! Dad, I need my guitar. Can we talk about this when I get back? Please? Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Nicky! Give him to me! Give him to me! Is he all right? Yes, yes, he's all right. Chris, are you okay? You're drunk! You almost killed my boy! You stupid, reckless... I'm so sorry. I should've known. I should've been the one to keep him from jumping! I was his best friend! I should have been aware! I shouldn't have... I should've known. Ohh! Hello. Yes. Whose pet monkey is it? You handle it. All right. Thank you. Sorry. There's really nothing I can do. If it had been just him and me, maybe. That's not the way it was. Chris needs his friends right now. He needs to be in school. He needs to learn not to throw books through windows when he doesn't get his way. I went as far with him as I could. Appreciate your time. Jim... You want to talk... About anything? No. Good seeing you again. Hey, remember us? In my nightmares. About the recording session... We paid for the joint. So let's record something, okay? You guys have seen my records. Everything's already been recorded. Something of our own, huh? Come on, Chris. Let's do it. Hey... We're no good without him, man. Look, he was great, but he's only one out of five. Don't sell the rest of us short. Hi. Hi, Chris. How you doing? My... My dad took my guitar. I've got this one here. It's an old '55 Telecaster. I haven't touched it in 15 years. Maybe somebody ought to play it. I'll play it. Hey. Hey! What do you think this is, history class? I'm sorry. I guess I must've... I guess so. Come in my office. What you got there, Chris? The music charts for Pinafore. Ah, terrific. I know they don't care much for what they have now. Thanks. Chris. Why don't you come back to class? I don't know, Mr. Verdell. I kind of like sleeping late. Come back. You'll have to toe the line for the rest of the year. I can't give you any more chances. I egged your house once when I was a sophomore. Aha... I'm, like, apologizing. I'm, like, uh... accepting. Thank you. Evening. What's up? Hey... Here, man. Take this. I got something. Got what? A song, you idiot. Something we can lay down, something you can sing. You wrote it? To David's music. The music's great. The lyrics, well... All right. Cool. Let's do it. All right. Nobody's even in there. There's nothing I can do. It's my job. What's up? Why aren't you guys inside? You have to move your car. Why's that? We're condemning the area. It's unsafe. It's over, man. But it sounds so good in there! - Hi, Mrs. Sinclair. - Hello. How are you? I'm okay. Um... I was wondering, um... We don't have anywhere to practice. I played this song on the piano last night. The words are really beautiful. I love it. Thanks. I wanted you to see it. Yeah. I got to go to work. ♪ Da da da da da da ♪ Da da da da da da da ♪ Da da da da ♪ Da da da da da da da ♪ Leaning out the window of my car ♪ And wishing on another lucky star Okay, so that's the tune. All right. I got to split. All right. So? Was it terrible? What? The lyrics, you bonehead. Oh, yeah. The lyrics. Actually, they're great. One major flaw, man. You got to sing it. No, no. I can't do everything, man. They're right. You should sing it. Later. Later. It's a great melody. It's great words. Yeah. Gaily tripping, lightly skipping. Gaily tripping, lightly skipping. - Are you nervous? - No. Me either. Lauren? I'm M.G. I know who you are. I'm asking, where is Lauren? I'm here. Oh. One minute! Wait, wait. Stand still.
