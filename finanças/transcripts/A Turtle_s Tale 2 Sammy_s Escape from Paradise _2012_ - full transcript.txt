Oh, no, I'm not really talking about you ... Surgelez it. You're my favorite cousin. Kiss me. All this is a misunderstanding. This can not end well. - You are hard boss. - Drastic! Shut up. He got what he deserved. In addition, there is no place for us 2. Let it cool a little. What is it? What-there-is-here come back later. Annabel, you must stop you to go alone, darling. But, Mom ... Silence! You exhausted me. You disappear constantly. - And who are you? - I'm Ella. Me and Ricky. You're going to eat? No. Sorry for making you afraid. What are you doing here all alone two?

Everyone I know what you mean. It was also difficult to adapt. But in fact, the place is not so bad. Murderers! Murderers! All murderers, these humans. They're going to eat ... all! We are damned here! Pobrecito, it must be the evening "lobster". It is a way to escape. Nobody out here for free. Jimbo! You're out of here. - How? - Dying. OK, that's enough! Must explain. Yes, you must tell us this story because we all thought you had failed. It was an accident, pure and simple. Humans clean these tanks here. I told myself that if I was dead, they would reject me in the ocean. It is not death, emptying freedom. Everything was fantástico. I was sure of my success, when ... Hey, sweetie. Yes, I'm almost done. I should be back in about 1 hour. Sure, I can go through it. Can you speak louder? I can barely hear you. OK, let me note. I'm listening. A shawarma. With a lot of hummus. The guy started writing like crazy. Meanwhile, I dry like a catfish on a Hot Tin Roof. We all expected the arrival of Jimbo, when Big D discovered that he had spun and became muy loco. Yes, Big D did not want one of us solo queue, as he called it. Big D knew that, is that I was wrong start. The guy eventually hang up. And me: Reject me, dammit! - Of course not! Hey, honey, it's me again. How many bottles of Mango Lassi should I bring? It was now or never. I had to push myself, I move. And suddenly ... - You were so really dead? - Yes. - Everyone thought. - Including me! And what happened? Well ... as you requested. It was then my leap of death. You have strange powers, Jimbo. Have you seen something that could help us? Prudence, Sammy. Big D spying on us. What is this blurb? We must get out of here. Now! Someone becomes impatient! Follow me. You see this pipe there? Freedom, baby! - Which one? - Whatever. You're the boss. You decide. Between all examined. And give me a report. Oh, and watch out for the penguins. You can not trust them. And how does one so far? I volunteer, sir! You know? The problem is solved. Hey, cousin. How are you? The white matter is colder than shrimp on ice. I become trophobe clip. Forward, Lulu, before you geliez. I thought, if we did turn around? Turn? Stop thinking, wimp! You should be ashamed! Look, the escape plan from Big D, taking eighth. Ninth, in fact. Do not forget the sea slug, honey. She wrinkled, is not it? Absolutely! Someone is wrong exit! But of course! Males that do not require their way? What's up, my dear! OK, Lulu, let's go! My legs freeze. Let me help you. I began to have doubts. It seems highly difficult. Shut up and concentrate, soldier. No, children are staying there. It slides here. I let go. I do not like it. We must get out of here. The ice breaks! Oh, no, no ... Ray! Where are you, Ray? Do not worry, I'll get out of here. Hold on, my friend. Hold on. It's too heavy. Leave the ice. On the spot. Pathetic, do not you think? Help or not to help? I guess if you want peace, needed. It's time for tuna! Just in time, Ray! Talk about a plan. It was a suicide mission! Mission! Lulu? Where is Lulu? You're still with us. If it came down to lend a clip? Continue the mission, soldier! Continue recognition! Nurse! Poor Lulu. Damn it! It seemed unpromising. This makes ten. But ... holding accounts? How to leave. Fell gloriously in battle. Better than finishing eaten by a human. What ... ? Us, you should know that no plans of Big D - Never worked. - I'll get ... five out of five. Thank you. You're so mean. Yes. Like pulling sardines a baby seal. Yes, so know this ... He needed relief. From a time-out. My cousin has always been jealous of my success here. I had all the ladies. Anyway, it was a good way break the ice between us. You are. Where did you stay so long? Saw something useful? Ray was almost crushed. If you find it useful. It is hard. And where is the lulu-lobster? I have a mission for him. He does not fired. Yes ... What can we do? Sometimes there is collateral damage. - You feel me? - Actually, no. This is good. The important thing is that you are safe. Next time, maybe. This is not good. Your plans are useless. - What? - End of story. You thought that was the plan?! It was just take a look! This crazy lobster was unwise. He was not even supposed to be here! And no one told him to dive into the icy water. You will not accuse me of that! If the shell suits him, that the door. You do not know how to get out of here, huh? You want to see from someone? I'll show you how to get out. On the spot! Are you ready? - Good for you? - In my opinion, yes. For you? - For me, yes! For you? - Good for me. Really, because you seem concerned ... - That's it, both? - Yes. I think so. Watch your pretty white beads. Seriously? We did not sign up for this. To be clear, Big D, you want we go in her mouth? Trust me. Go ahead. You, first. Me? Why me? You're smaller, go first. Age of premium beauty ... OK, but whatever you do, do not devour me. Close your mouth now. Wow, it's dark in here. You have swallowed! come on! You can not stand the joke? Hey, Ricky, wake up. - What? - The sun is up. It's time to go. hello ! - Hello. - Where is Annabel? "Here it is!" Hey! Can we go play? No ... I think it's time to go, right? The Grand Aquarium is far? It will take some time. I hope they find a grandfather. I also want to meet your grandfather! Hang all. - Let's go. Hey, all of you will attend the success of my brilliant plan. If I had a dab of sand for each of its "brilliant plan" I have a famous colony. - I see them. - Me neither. Are you sure your plan will work? This show, believe me. Watch! Here it is! It could perhaps succeed. As if there had been any doubt. - Never, Boss, Ever! - No, absolutely. Big D is the best! Was not this a great escape? It was great, boss! Pure genius! A flair for the dramatic, boss! They have eaten! I know, I know! What? I said they would come out. They came out. Not my problem. Accurate. We babysitters? I do not even like babies. Yes, babysitters ... You are only scavengers. - It was horrible. - I do not understand. They let slip the dolphin. And we? Mira ... The place is too small for a dolphin. Their place is not here. And ours, yes? Yo sé, I know ... it does not make sense. They sometimes bring injured animals they treat and then release. We will find a way out. And fast! But not on an empty stomach! Look at them ... Say we thought Lulu was crazy. This is not a paradise. It is a prison. And we will never get out. Ray ... it takes. Ricky and Ella. They never survive alone. We have already seen worse than this. Yes ... you're right. A question ... what is this place? Human beings like to collect stuff. I will not be collected. I found Ricky and Ella! Thank you. A very big thank you. This place is really great. Mom, I want to help too. What have I said? Ella! Ricky! We found them! - Phew, unharmed. - Behind you! - Attention! - It's dangerous here! Swim as far as possible from here! What? They want to go? I do not understand. It just happened. - Go! - Swim, swim! Behind you! Behind you! They're coming! They're coming! Look behind you! No, no, no! Turn! Grandfather, beware! Shark! Behind you. Look behind you! Stand back! Get down, it will break the glass! Now I understand ... Attention! Hey, Albert. Listen ... I wanted to thank you for what you did for Ella and Ricky. Albert ... Therefore renounces. This door is too thick. As if I did not. But why ... ? I want everyone to know that we can never give up. If you do that ... you die. Understood, Albert. We will get out of here. Everyone - I hear something. - Help! Annabel is? Grandma! Help! Yes, it is his voice ... - Annabel? - Here! Come, let's go. Annabel, what are you doing here? I'm stuck. I can not move. Often put you in trouble. We'll get out of there. Stop it, stop it! - My head is spinning ... - Attention, Ricky! Not start again anymore. Ella ... Annabel! Wait, that's too dangerous! I bring grandma. It will protect you. I think it will now. The wicked fish are gone. Here's one that will spray you. OK? You really think your plan will succeed? I find it quite good. - Now what? - Wait and hope that the little ones show. If they are not already ... Hey, I see! - They are drawn! - What a relief! OK, do your thing. We show them our idea. - What are they doing now? - No idea. Again! - They do not are dipping. - Yes, you're right. Perhaps the ventilation ... Must try. Find the vent! You know what they mean? I think so! I am ... Seeing. Are you serious? This is zero. They will be reduced to mush! Ella! No! What have I done?! I will destroy him. We can never blow?! Help! Help! Annabel here! - Ricky! - Attention! You'll be stuck like me. A pi-yeuvre stuck? Ever. But you? Often put you in trouble. Yes, I've heard that. - It hurt! - Hey, you! Do not do it! This is my friend. File now! That's enough! Regain sewers are your domain. There are a lot of scary monsters here. Compared to humans, they are nice. I told you both dangers of Grand Aquarium. Not so fast, where Ella? I do not know, but I think she was sucked! Oh, the horror! The ink ... Of course! That's the plan! These are ... it is the eyes! - Here it is! - Ella! I'm really glad to see you. - I was afraid you ... - I'm fine. Look, I know how to release them. But I need your help. No problem. What can we do? I must have ink, tons! You are going to die hungry. What is the situation? - The children are there? - This is hopeless! - Who died? - Not now, OK? Your grandchildren are out. Perfect. Not if we're stuck here! But what do you care? - Look! - What ... ? - Check it out! - Oh, yes! They are very clever, your grandchildren! Ella! Ricky! Yes! - We're out of here! - Exit?! You do not freelancing? I'm the boss. I decide when it's time to go. Besides, what's your plan stupid? I know you, you interviewed. For now, you must not know anything. Oh, yeah? This is what we will see! Take your pick. OK, here we go. Albert was the calamari. - Be careful. - Oh, Sammy, look! Oh, no. It is not ready yet! Wait for my signal, OK? - We must act! - I'll take this side. It can be found here, gives the signal. As if I'd let you swim around playing the boss? No, do not tell me. You're afraid of being humiliated? - No time for all that. - Shut up! Me? Being humiliated by turtles? I do not think so. It is not our way of doing things. If I let it every idiot with a half-idea it would be chaos. That will not happen. At last, Let him, Big D! Forget your little escape plan. That's what you think! Approach, worm! Let yourself be insulted, Marco. Two against one, eh?! - That's all you got, Big D? - Ray! Catch it, Philip? Go! What are you doing? Okay, Sammy. I'm here. - Nice to see you, man. - Clear! He's right. You are both to useless. Big D! What happens here? Oh, look at that! One big happy family. Have you lost your mind? I save you all band sausages! False. You're trying to kill Sammy. So dramatic! Let me t'ôter it. I will not let this ruin our chances turtles rebels escape. Escape? We did not have a chance with your plans! Honestly, you have disappointed me. I have treated my family as and this is your thanks?! As you thanked Tremaine? Back strip cloths! You'll all put ourselves in the mirror? You are all crazy! Absolutely, mi amor. This is not the time to be - Quiet, mid amigos. - Come on. This plan with the dolphin ... It was not very well done, - Is it not, Señor D? - What? The poor lobster Lulu was sent suicide mission. Hey, not so fast! No one forced him to go the clip. But here goes ... Pressed head. What do you want? - This is unfair ... - Will you bang your head. This is what you do best. Priceless, this guy. Boss! No, no. This is not good. It stinks! I want out! It's alive! Boss! You're alive! No thanks to you! What should we do?! OK, everyone. We will escape. And this time, everyone out! And them? Even these two idiots infantry. But the boss? We release outside. This is good, is not it, Big D? In fact ... ... I do not want to leave. But ... what is the address? I do not understand. It will be free, huh? Free! You never really wanted to go, huh? Outside there is a small hippocampus helpless. Let him go. OK, it's time to leave! Hey! Wait! Where are you going? You make a mistake listening to these turtles. Never heard of a plan so stupid. OK! This is the hour of the show! Forward now! Yes, like that! All over the body! People really need to think we are on the verge of dying! Mira, are peligroso. Do not exaggerate, OK? It could be toxic. What happens here? There is a problem with this fish? - It is perhaps part of the show. - Yes? Look what Jimbo! It is clearly quite dramatic! Mom, look! It seems ... a horror movie! There's something wrong here ... - This is cool! - No, not really. Come, my darling. They believe it will come out soon! Big D! You do not want to change your mind? Yes, boss. What will you do without us? You think you're all two irreplaceable? Think again though! They are not yet out of here! Let it come! Again, again, again! Nice work, Annabel. Mi amor? Where are you, mi amor? - I do not see you. - Manual, estoy aquí. It's like the dark cave of our 1st meeting. Do you remember? How could I forget? Eyes! Eyes! They can not see me! Fantastic! - Look at this mess. - They seem dead. - And all on the back! - What's going on? Hey, fish comic. You do not laugh now, huh? Big D. .. humans must open the doors. I began to be passed out ... You should have listened to me. - So what? - From oil, I think. - Oil? - Please ... What's going on? The oil kills fish. Crénom name! Some really bad mine. We will soon no longer pretend. Hang on. We're almost out. It is clear that you are out of here. In shrouds! Let's see how you're going to shoot. I love this show ... Plan B! It is time to act. Jimbo, no! Back! Please return to your calm. What has he that? - We must act. - You lose time. - Take Action! - And on the spot! Called a vet! - We must act! - I got it! - And now, problem solved! - What? - He's joking! - Come on, man! Wait ... Treats? This guy is a clown! Enough of this crap! Let me go! I can not do anything. There is a solution. You must open the emergency doors. All fish escape! Otherwise ... they will die. And I'll be fired. No way! - Now! - This guy should be fired. Do what it says! - Open the gates! - I do not believe it. Please, stop! I have to call the owner. Wait ... I have an idea. Happy hour! The house offers a drink! Free drinks? Since the arrival of the turtles, the level frieze dramatic peaks. I bet they are two pimps involved. Sammy! There is too much ink! - We should all cancel. - Too late! They can not hear us or see us. This is my hair! Okay, I'll do it! Freedom! Damn, that is ... ? - The doors open! - Finally! - It's time ... - We save the fish! Fantastic! Oh, no! I have to stop it. They're coming! - All shall be well. - They set the time. - Another glass? - I'm hungry. - On order to eat? - No fish. It seemed to have recognized you. Boss! Security here! Stop that! It's not ... But what ... ? I have ... check something. I'll be right back. This is not true! I was trapped! I have to close the doors! Security! What a nightmare! Saint tandoori! Lobster! What will we do now, Philip? I always wanted to see New Jersey. You're kidding ... New Jersey. - Seriously? - Absolutely. - This is where? - No idea. You clamps! Thou clips! What's going on? It hurts! Stop it! Removes that! OK, lobster, I'll cut you. - Take off that! - Stay calm, boss. You win a fallback position! - Come on, hurry up ... - Hurry! Look! This Consuelo and Manual. What do you expect? They may close at any time! - We are. - Excuse me? It will remain here as me and mi amor. We seem to be unique. It is a way of seeing things. But Sammy and I prefer nature. We also know vidaloca with Big D in the corner. I hope everyone was successful. Go before being caught again. You will all be missed. Take care of yourself and tell the brother Big D needs to calm down. Hey! The lobster tip! Lock the damn door for us! Wait, Ray, is not it ... Soon the door! Careful not to be crushed! Andale, Lulu ... There happen. Stand back and cling to the shells! Touchdown! A hand, please ... I live! I am still alive! Am I alive? A bull in a china shop! Nice to see you, Lulu. Thank you. It's so good to be free. Thank you very much for your help. Hey, kids! - Have you seen our grandfathers? - Yes. They are still in order to ensure that everyone can get. Typical grandfather. This Jimbo! This is a funny fish. - He's dead again. - What does it? Opens the eyes. Jimbo, it's us. Wake up! - Ricky! Ella! - Grandpa! - You did it! - It was great! I think we have a problem. Grandfather, Jimbo does not move. Back! I had a battle formation. OK, we all know that you can play dead. Awake, Jimbo. Come on, soldier! Some energy! We won the battle! Rest! I know what to do. Turn away, Lulu. I've seen people do it on the beach. Well, Jimbo, come back to you! Useless to pretend! It has escaped! I'm afraid that Jimbo does not return. Move over, Sammy. Let me try. Why do these eyes? There's a death? You. You must stop your show. One day, someone will cut it into fillets before you do awaken. Are you crazy?! Look at his portrait. No threads to finish. Lulu, dear, I'm holding the clamp. Hats off for what you did for me. Oh, Lord ... It was nothing ... What are you talking about here, man?! It is I who made the biggest! And I was in a coma or something? Always crazy. Here they are! - Our saviors! - Thanks for your help. No problem. That's what friends are for, right? And if we left this place, my friends? Oh, yes. Earlier this place will be a memory, the better. More ... I must return to my sweet. Do you understand me? I think so. Delighted to have you back, Ray. What do we have here? It's dinner time! Hey! Brian! These turtles have a pass! Are you kidding or what?! These are delicacies! Closer look, bird brain. They told me out of this boat. Forbidden zone, I said. OK. I was wrong. One wonders how they were fleeing humans. Let me enjoy this. Oh, Ray, my darling! Look at them, it seems kids crushed by their love. Looks like someone will eventually crushed, right? Okay, Grandpa? These turtles look so ... So cute. Ah, if my mother had been be as gentle as a child. I want a hug. You know how to cut the appetite of a bird, you know? Big D, Big D, they look at me again! It does not improve. I ... Enough, kind of crazy. You'll still make me crazy. But it is the faces ... Especially this one. The horror! The horror! I want out of here!
