Like the Clouds, Like the Wind What?! Th-The emperor... H-He's dead? Yes. The emperor... has departed this world. The emperor is dead! The emperor is dead! In the 34th year of the Fukuei Era, the 17th emperor of the nation of Sokan passed away. The emperor had 550 wives. They lived in a building called the inner palace, but with the death of the emperor, it is to be demolished. His wife, soon to become the Empress Dowager, must leave this place, for this had always been the rule. Some wives cried. Others gave up. Still others prepared immediately to return to their home towns. This march of diverse women was a curious sight indeed, but in the short time until the enthronement of the next emperor, the palace would also become a den of intrigue. They're attempting to move up the prince's enthronement? Hireikaku must be gathering vengeful eunuchs and plotting... Those insufferable schemers. My son, Heitetsu, should be the next emperor. Seitono, I want you to arrange things so that Heitetsu will take the throne instead. Did you not hear me? The crown prince must be... immediately. Yes, Your Highness... She's a notorious schemer, after all. We'll need to act swiftly. Indeed. The rumors are still swarming that the emperor's death was not from illness, but poisoning. And that scheming woman is the primary suspect! We don't know what she might do to the crown prince if we don't hurry. We must hold the enthronement as soon as possible! To do that, he must choose an empress as soon as possible. To choose an empress, we must assemble potential brides from all over the country. Consorts. A consort hunt. Thus, to find potential brides for the new emperor, officials of the inner palace, known as eunuchs, dispersed throughout the country to the towns of their birth. A humble entreaty for consorts. The emperor's bereavement upends our nation's status quo. Ergo, we seek recruitment of ladies sagacious and noble from our lands to vie for the role of empress. Oda Province has served as cornerstone to our country's millennium of peace, which is why we have chosen... Hey, that's some pretty tricky words on that plaque. What's it mean? It's saying that the emperor died, and they're recruiting consorts for his successor. Consorts? What are consorts? Potential brides for the emperor. They bring beautiful women from all over the country and educate them to be worthy of marrying the emperor. So the consorts get lessons? And if you get lucky and win the empress spot, you'll wear beautiful clothes, eat and sleep all day... Eat and sleep all day? And if you can birth a crown prince, you'll be showered in luxury. I wish I'd had this chance when I was young. I wouldn't have been saddled with that louse of a husband... Daddy! Is that you, Ginga? I'm gonna marry the emperor! I am Mano, the eunuch. I was dispatched to Oda Province to find consorts. I'm... Um... Silence! Um... Um... Face front when you speak! Stand. What is your name? Ginga! If your mother were alive, she'd try to stop you. How come? She'd have her doubts you'd be happy as a consort. Daddy, will I definitely be happy if I stay in the country? I don't need to be so very happy. And I'd get to see the bustling capital, meet all kinds of people and talk to them... And then, and then... Well, I'd get to eat and sleep all day! Daddy? Yeah? Once I'm gone, you oughta get a bride of your own. What?! Go for it, Daddy! Yes ma'am. Ginga! Yeah? What is it, old man? Old man?! I am the eunuch, Mano! Gotcha. So, what is it? You should get in the palanquin! No way! I can't see the scenery from the palanquin! I can't have my chosen bride candidate turning brown in the sun! Does the emperor like 'em pasty? Well... I actually didn't ask what he liked... But everyone knows that a woman should be fair-skinned! Who says that's gotta be so? The emperor? Or you, old man? Nobody said it! And I am not an old man! I am the eunuch, Mano! I know your name, but you're still an old man. Did I choose wrong, perhaps? No, no. I've seen many consorts in my time, and I know what I'm looking at. That girl is a jewel. She'll sparkle with polishing. I will produce an empress from my home of Oda Province! Then maybe I'll get a big promotion! Which means that before I enter Sokan Castle, I must polish her! I must scrub that muddy radish to be worthy of soup... I mean... to become a lady! She needs training! Education! Your manners are terrible. You can't yawn open-mouthed like that in front of people! Yeah, but... I'm just so bored. Proper speech. Proper carriage. You must learn them all before we reach the palace. Sounds like the palace is a pretty stuffy place. That wasn't what I was told. What were you told that made you want to become a consort? Eating and sleeping all day long! Hey, when are we leaving? Can't you see it's raining out there? That's a Pon. I'll be luckier next time... The rain's let up! Hold your horses. You see those mountains, don't you? Apparently, some terrible bandits have taken up residence there of late. We need to plan our departure carefully. Luck's finally turned my way! Okay, another half-game. What's wrong with you?! Ginga! We can't leave because it's raining? We can't leave because of bandits? We've been holed up in this inn for ten days over this stuff! I'm about to die of boredom! This is why I'm trying to teach you manners! I'm done! I'm going back to Oda Province! Ginga! Wait! Ginga! Darn it! They make me so mad! Watch it! You're a lively one, aren't you? S-Sorry. I see. Are you one of the potential brides for the emperor heading to Sokan Castle? Who are you, old man? My name is Konton. I live in Kasai Village. I was called here by Mano the eunuch. Glad I met you. Could you lead me to his room? Sure! But what do you want with him? He said he had a job for the Kasai Village irregulars. Irregulars? What's that? A gang of no-good ruffians. Ruffians? But we also help people under the right circumstances. That is to say, when there's something in it for us. Which way is it? This way! Is she really gonna try to marry the emperor? Well, Ginga? It looked like I was playing, but I really was preparing. With the irregulars guarding us, we'll have no need to fear the bandits. It would've been cheaper to just hire the bandits. What an obnoxious girl you are! No, no, I must not speak that way. I'm the one who chose her, after all. I must make her a lady, somehow! But it seems hopeless. Bro Kenton. A wannabe bride to the emperor has gotta be pretty, right? Right? I'm not sure... She's got her charms, for sure. I'm gonna look! Hey, Heisho! 'Scuse me! I'm Heisho, leader of the Kasai Village irregulars! Huh? The bride was yawning. She's still a child. I don't see any bandits... That's because we're keeping you safe! If bandits show up, will you beat them? You bet we will! Then I hope they show up! Bit bloodthirsty, aren't ya? Well, you think we're paying you just to walk? That little wench! She's one honest girl. Bro Kenton. You really think that wild child could marry the emperor? I bet she'll be back straight away after they kick her out. No. That girl... Ginga, was it? I have a feeling she might just be our next empress. Call it a gut feeling. The capital! This'll be goodbye for a while. What is this place? The entrance to the inner palace. The old lady there will guide you through. Give it your best, Ginga. Your future awaits you through that gate. Sure! Not "sure"! Say "yes, sir"! I got it! I beg you, Ginga. My dreams are riding on you. But it's probably hopeless... Or perhaps... Perhaps the new emperor likes strange girls? I'm... I mean... My name is Ginga! So dark... The way in is awfully long, huh? How much longer is it? Can you really see when it's dark like this? Hey, say something! Say something, I said! Why won't you say anything? Can you not talk or something? Why don't you just say something already?! It's gotten chilly... Is that the way out? Who said that? What, couldn't you hear me? It's no fun just standing there. Why won't you walk forward? We can talk while we walk. The Weeping Gate's exit is right ahead. Weeping Gate? It is the name of this long, tunnel-like gate. Those who pass through it seem to find it unsettling, but to one such as I, it is a great comfort. When I wish to be alone, or to think in peace and quiet, this place is very useful. She smells nice... And I meet people like you here, too, at times. Did you come here to try to marry the new emperor? Me? My name is Ginga. Who are you? Koryun. Koryun? We may meet again, in time. Ask the Weeping Gate guide take you to your quarters. You're leaving? I was hoping we could keep talking... I mean, this old lady won't say anything. She's no fun at all! Would you let go of me already?! You stupid chatterbox... My hand was going numb! You've got the strength of an ox, you know. There! I'm liberated from that foolish girl! What a wonderful feeling. You think I'm boring, do you? Listen to me! Everyone knows that the guide does not speak within the Weeping Gate! And ignorant fool that you are, you just kept blabbing, blabbing, and blabbing on! You do impress me, though. Most girls start to go crazy traveling through that long tunnel. Some of them even faint! But don't get overconfident over that! The education in the inner palace is strict. Once a month, many girls will have to go back the other way. You'd better study hard so that you're not one of them. Now I'm supposed to show you to your quarters? That's not my job. I hold the hand of the girls coming and going through the Weeping Gate, and that's it. You can stand here and wait! A eunuch named Ino will come soon enough. He'll show you to your lodgings. Now, I bet the next girl is waiting in front of the Weeping Gate right now. Guess I'd better go. Three shifts a day, and the next one is my last. I hope I'll get a good girl next time. Later! Don't do anything to get kicked out so that you have to walk back through the Weeping Gate tomorrow! Hey... I thought the inner palace would be more beautiful... As you can see, the new palace isn't finished yet. And until your training's finished, you live in the lodging house anyway. What's the training? They're lessons, to make you worthy wives to the emperor. So we do get lessons! That's great. I always wanted an education! I'm glad to hear it. Study hard, or you'll be kicked out before you ever see the palace. This is your room. One girl's already here. Be a considerate roommate, all right? Close that door at once! My name is Ginga! I hear four of us will be staying here. What's your name? Are you another Weeping Gate lady? Why would I be a Weeping Gate lady?! Well, you wouldn't talk to me... I am nobility. I am under no obligation to speak to a commoner like you. There's only one vanity in this room... So what? I want to comb my hair, too! You're done, right? So step aside, okay? This is my personal vanity. Then what am I supposed to do? There's a mirror in the privy. You can use that. So your name's Sesamei, huh? How dare you touch my things without asking! I'll call you Sesamei! You're wrong. It's Seshamin! What an ignoramus you are. Seshamin? Lady. You must address me as "Lady." Lady Seshamin. Then you should call me Lady Ginga, too! Don't make me laugh, little peasant girl. Come in! Anyway, the result is obvious, so you might as well go home right now. Huh? What result? The one the emperor will marry. You can come in! Huh? What? Gracious, talking with you is such a chore. I'm telling you that the emperor's bride will be a woman like me. Family, breeding, and beauty. I have the full package. That's why I'm going to be the empress. You don't stand a chance, so you might as well go back to the country. I wonder what's wrong... I keep saying "come in," but they won't do it. They probably have the wrong room. Just leave them be! We're not children! If they needed something, they'd just come in! Hey, hey... hey! What's wrong? Are you not feeling well? Is it open now? I'm Ginga. Who are you? Koyo. Where are you from? Kanan. Why were you sleeping outside? The door wouldn't open. Wouldn't open? I can't come in if it's not open. But... That's the rule. In my country, if a person knocks and the door doesn't open, we're not supposed to go in. It's unbearable! Is this it? Koryun? My name is Tamyun. I will be sharing this room with you. I may go off on my own from time to time, but do not let it trouble you. They're all freaks! I don't think I can take this! Yesterday, Sokan's 18th Emperor was enthroned. The seventeen-year-old emperor was truly a striking and august sight. After six months, the young emperor will choose an empress from among you. We'll be holding lessons starting today, so study hard in preparation for that coming day. We are the only school for women in the country. On top of that, Sokan's foremost scholar will be handling your lessons. Professor Seto Kakuto. Professor Kakuto will now introduce himself. I am Seto Kakuto. I shall be assisting you with your lessons for the next six months. For what reason is it that we educate you? To make you women worthy of the emperor, of course. First, you'll learn general knowledge and culture. The emperor is a very cultured person himself. Do you think he would choose a woman less so to be his bride? Second, you'll receive an in-depth and accurate education in human physiology. Then, and while it does not quite count as an academic field, exercise. We must have you producing healthy babies for the emperor. Therefore, it is important for you to be in excellent health. I shall now introduce Professor Kikyo, who will be assisting me. He will be handling physiology and exercise. I am Kikyo. I shall try my hardest, so I hope that you all will, too. He's so handsome! Hey! Hey! Wasn't Professor Kakuto's lecture interesting today? I just loved it! Oh? I thought the young ladies preferred Assistant Kikyo. Oh, no way! That guy's a total bumpkin! What's this? It's what they talk about that matters. Professor Kakuto's lessons were just so educational! I'm glad to hear that. Tamyun, you really do look like Koryun... You've met Koryun? We talked in the Weeping Gate. In the Weeping Gate? I see... Yeah? What is it? I am Koryun's older sister. Two sisters? In the inner palace? This is just between us. Understand? But I didn't see Koryun at the lecture today! Koryun has other business to attend to. Where are you going? You'll get scolded if you wander about at night. I told you not to worry about the things that I do. I hope Ino finds you and kicks you right out! You know, if you brush your hair like that all day, you'll make yourself bald. What did you say?! The blood all went to my head... Honestly, I'm surrounded by freaks! Not only did you fail to see my Heitetsu enthroned, the new emperor has already ascended! Seitono. Explain yourself. After his morning's work, the new emperor hides himself somewhere. After considerable effort, I have managed to find that hiding place. Oh? And where is Koryun hiding, exactly? The last place you would expect. The last place I would expect? Rather than lecturing you all day, I wish to also ask you a question. How about it? You, in the front row. Y-Yes? You are a woman. And though I am rather old, I am a man. Do you know what differentiates men and women? Well... their appearance. What part of their appearance? Well... the shape of their bodies. That by itself is quite insufficient. As you know, clothing can disguise the shape of the body. You might think it will be clear when they're naked, but sometimes, God produces a body that could be either male or female. That makes things difficult. Now, sit. What about you? What is it that differentiates men and women? I don't know! And you? I don't know. Professor! Go ahead. I think it's their hearts that are different! That's an interesting opinion, but it's wrong. There are some men who have the heart of a woman. As you all know, there are men who fall in love with other men. At times like that, a man may act as if he has the heart of a woman. Any other answers? None? Then I'll be forced to tell you the answer. However, I don't believe this answer is appropriate for me to tell you. That is to say, I think it's more important for you to find it for yourselves. It's possible that you may not find an answer. Oh, come on! Did you have something to say? You have to tell us the answer! If you don't, I won't be able to sleep at night! Goodness me! Please tell me! What is your name? Ginga! Indeed, it can be troubling to have a question without an answer. But this is not like a riddle, where the answer will simply come to you. But you know the answer, right? I do, but my answer is merely my answer. Then tell us your answer! No. It took me fifty years to come up with my answer. I think it would be a bit unfair to just tell it to you. You're a major tightwad, Professor. Tightwad?! If it took you fifty years to learn the answer, how long are we supposed to wait? Five years? Three years? Just one year? Really, now. Well, it seems we're out of time. Today's lecture is now over. Tightwad! You should get ready. You were so rude to Professor Kakuto, he'll kick you out for sure. Koyo. You agree, don't you? Couldn't say. Ginga. The professor is calling you. Ino. She's being kicked out, isn't she? I couldn't say. That Tamyun girl, too. She goes wandering around by herself at night. That's breaking the rules, right? Tamyun? Well... Koryun! It's been some time. Did the professor call for you? For a scolding? What's she doing here? I couldn't say. Thank you for coming. Not used to seeing books, eh? Have you really read all of these books? I've read about half of them. The other half are just for decoration? No, the others are books that I wrote. Professor. I'm sorry I was so rude this afternoon. I just lose my temper sometimes. My father used to scold me for it a lot. No, perhaps I was being stingy with you. Before you kick me out, I really want to know the answer. Who said I was kicking you out? But Ino said that 23 girls have already flunked out and left. Well, I'm not kicking you out. I was thinking I might give the answer just to you. Really?! Yes. But remember, this is only my personal answer. Sure! So, what is it? Having children. It's something only women can do. Oh, what? It took you fifty years to come up with that? My mommy had me when she was eighteen. Though she only lived to be twenty... That's a bit simplistic. Women can have children because they have a womb. Duh, I know that! Professor Kikyo gives us lessons in that stuff, too. Then you understand, don't you? The womb is a precious place where babies grow, a palace. Those who make these palaces for children are known as "woman." And that's the conclusion you reached? Indeed. It is an extremely deep, occult philosophy. What's a philosophy? The perception of a thing's true essence. What's an essence? Well, it's... You may go. I'm happy to hear that you won't have to leave. Where are you going, Ginga? This Way's a shortcut! Koryun! Koryun! Koryun! I did it! Sister! Koryun. Were you injured? What are you doing here, my sister? I was worried, so I infiltrated the lodging houses. Damn you! I'll fillet you all and serve you on a platter! Ginga, our enemies have fled. Koryun. Are you okay? Yeah. Thank you, Ginga. Where's Kon? The record house. Reading again, huh? Hey, Kon! You in here? Yeah, I'm in here, Heisho. No, wait... you changed your name to Iryuda, didn't you? You spend every damn day reading and reading... How do you not get sick of it? What's up? You're back early. I came back because I was bored. I'm sick of being a bureaucrat! Some people would kill to have your problems. For purging the mountain bandits, the governor adopted you, and changed your name to the more worthy "Iryuda." Adopting me just meant I had to marry his dusty old spinster daughter! What's the big deal? Being a bureaucrat means banquets and receptions all day long, right? Sounds like a nice life. But that's what I'm sick of! Listen, Bro. The reason I changed my name wasn't because I wanted to be a bureaucrat and fritter my life away doing nothing. I wanted the opposite! Iryuda means "making dreams reality!" I want to chase my dreams, even if it's an illusion! Are you serious? Totally serious! Even if it means abandoning your position? I'll even leave my family! Take that! The truth is, I was getting sick of reading books, myself. Well, Iryuda? Want to start recruiting? What's recruiting? Raising an army. We'll start a rebellion. Rebellion? You know? The court up in Hokushi is in disarray right now. The statesmen and the eunuchs are focused on power struggles and lining their own pockets. The young emperor probably doesn't have the power to suppress the traitors. Oh, yeah? You sure know a lot about that distant capital... I've heard a lot, sticking with you in the governor's household. Besides, look around you. Heavy taxes, high labor. More and more people are speaking out against the emperor. They're hungry for change. A rebellion, eh? A rebellion! If we round up the old gang and march on Hokushi, others will join us on the way. If we give them a sock in the nose from 10,000 or 30,000 fists, then they'll have to get to work for us. And we won't be bored for a while, at least. That might just be fun. Let's do it! One, two, three, four! Two, two, three, four! Three, two, three, four! Four, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Two, two, three, four! You think these exercises are really good for us? Two, two, three, four! Three, two, three, four! You think these exercises are really good for us? I don't know, but I do like looking at Professor Kikyo. Four, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! I don't know, but I do like looking at Professor Kikyo. Two, two, three, four! More than the emperor? Two, two, three, four! Two, two, three, four! Well, I don't know what the emperor looks like! Two, two, three, four! Three, two, three, four! Well, I don't know what the emperor looks like! Four, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Two, two, three, four! What if the emperor has a creep face like Professor Kikyo's? Two, two, three, four! Three, two, three, four! What if the emperor has a creep face like Professor Kikyo's? Three, two, three, four! I'm sure you won't need to worry. Four, two, three, four! You'll never meet the emperor anyway. Four, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! You'll never meet the emperor anyway. Excuse me! That group there! Stop talking! One, two, three, four! Six months certainly pass in the blink of an eye. There are a great many fewer faces here than when we started. All else aside, I can see that you've worked very hard. Which means your graduation exams will begin tomorrow. "Seihi" is the empress's title. Below her are the Kohi. Then the Fujin, Hinhi, Shofu... We'll all have different ranks when we enter the inner palace. Is that all decided by the test results? Not just that, I'm sure. Then what? I'm sure intelligence is the primary qualifier, and Ginga does well enough with that. But I'm sure that's not enough. Oh? What else is there, then? Refinement. Someone with the innate grace to be an empress. In other words, a born noble such as myself. It's in the bag! I'll be the Seihi for sure! Charge! Crush the cavalry at once! If we take this fort, the Hokuban Gate is next! And past that, the capital! It was a strange whim of fate. Iryuda's rebellion, started out of boredom, had amassed 35,000 soldiers, which took out the Baryo Gate, then proceeded to the Hokuban Gate, which was said to be impregnable. Ginga! You did it! You did it! You were named the Seihi! It's incredible! I just knew you had it in you! You were never a muddy radish at all! You were a proper lady! Now I'll be promoted for sure! I did it! Why am I a Hinhi and Ginga is the Seihi? I'm a Saijin, I guess. That's seventh from the top. I'm fourth. That all sounds about right. And what about you, Tamyun? I didn't receive a rank. So Ginga is the emperor's first wife... That's right! Why am I the fourth?! What's wrong, Ginga? You aren't happy that your dream came true? Eating and sleeping all day, remember? Yeah, I know... You seem rather down. Why? I'm just not sure. I mean, it's not just me. Nobody knows what the emperor looks like. Can there be love in a marriage to someone you don't even know? I feel a little like we've been exploited. The emperor is a good man. I'm sure you'll like him very much. Just because you like him doesn't necessarily mean that I will. When I was chasing this, I got so swept up, I wasn't thinking about it. But now, I keep remembering what my daddy said. Will this really make me happy? It almost makes me want to run away... It's a bit late for that! Maybe the emperor really does like strange girls... The emperor has arrived. It's been a while, Ginga. Koryun! You look like you've seen a ghost! Koryun. Why are you here? Because I'm the emperor. You liar. You're a woman! I am a man. Shall I prove it? Prove it? I'll take off my clothes. No, no! Fine, I get it. You're such a liar, though... I never said that I was a woman. I guess not, but still... But if you're the emperor, what were you doing in the Weeping Gate? People are trying to kill me. You remember the other night, don't you? Yeah... So, who's trying to kill you? Empress Dowager Kin. She was the last emperor's wife, but she was not my mother. The Empress Dowager has an 11-year-old son. In other words, my half-brother. The Empress Dowager wants to kill me and make him the emperor in my place. That's why I hid in the inner palace when I don't have official business to attend to. But they have learned of that, and I now have no place to hide. Right now, this is the only safe place I have. Ginga. I can trust you. After consulting with Professor Kakuto, I chose you as my empress. But I... Professor Kakuto explained that you're still a child. I don't mind. What I need right now is a friend who will listen to my worries. The court is in very serious trouble right now. The ministers and eunuchs only care about power struggles and lining their pockets. And there is something else that troubles me. There is a massive uprising in the country. The rebel army is attacking the northern fortress, the Hokuban Gate. I dispatched a general named Osaibi, a loyal court adviser, to lead the forces against them. I think he may hold them off, but if Osaibi were to die in battle, then I... Bad news inside and out, huh? But then isn't this room at risk? Don't worry. You're strong. You have me here, too. Tamyun! Sister... I am in the room next door. Ginga... rather, Gin Seihi. If you need anything, tell me. Wow, you really cleaned it all up. What happened? Something you said to me got through to me. What is it I've really been studying all these fifty years? By the way, how are things with the emperor? Great! We drink tea, eat sweets, and talk. It's fun. Is that all? Yeah! Really... No hope for a crown prince any time soon, then... Leaving already, Gin Seihi? It's about time for Koryun to be back. Then please tell the emperor this: I have expelled my pupil, Kikyo. Professor Kikyo? That wretch. I knew he was ambitious and greedy, but lately he's been cooperating with the Empress Dowager. Ginga. Ginga. I won't be able to come here for a while. Oh? Starting tomorrow, I will need to see to things at court day and night. I thought it was dangerous to leave the inner palace... I can't worry about that anymore. The Hokuban Gate has fallen. The rebel army is charging towards the capital with great speed. If I do not hurry to rebuild our forces, our court may be destroyed. Beginning tonight, I intend to remain at court, directing our army. Ginga. It is possible that we may not ever be true man and wife. Koryun... Koryun! That's a flintlock pistol. It can fire only once. Koryun! Sister. It's a good thing I was next door, Koryun. That was a close call... Yes... A eunuch, influenced by Kikyo. So even the inner palace is no longer safe... It seems that nowhere in this world is safe anymore. Unable to hold back the rebels' vigorous charge, the imperial army was on the verge of total collapse. The officials who learned of this quickly rounded up their valuables and fled the castle. The wealthy of the city also gathered up their things and left. Only the poor, who had nowhere else to go, remained in the capital. Are you saying you're running away? It's clear that we'll be killed when the rebel army arrives. We can still fight! There are 5.000 soldiers in Tohoku, aren't there? But their head general, Ryorin, has already fled. The general has? It would be in your best interest to flee the country at once, as well. I shall not run! This is my country. My ancestors have ruled this country from this castle for centuries. I cannot allow that to end with me... I fear we must be going. The idea that women should protect the inner palace is in line with my philosophy. The inner palace being like the womb of the country... Professor! We don't have time for a philosophy lecture! What do you want me to do? You are very wise. Please, teach us how to fight them. Oh, absolutely not. I've never studied the art of weaponry. But... I do know history. The last emperor, Fukuso, was quite a hobbyist. The cannons, pistols, and rifles he collected are still within the armory. Those could help us a great deal. A messenger from the Empress Dowager? My name is Kikyo. I come with a message from the Empress Dowager. Ahh. Let's hear it. Speak up. The Empress Dowager wishes to welcome you to Sokan Castle, General Iryuda. The Empress Dowager wants to welcome me? Wait a minute. How does the emperor feel about this? Well, the truth is... It's a bit odd for the mother to surrender without the emperor's say-so. Well, the truth is... The current emperor is not the Empress Dowager's real child. The Empress Dowager hopes that the moment General Iryuda enters Sokan Castle, she might use the opportunity to dethrone the current emperor, and instate her real son, Heitetsu, as the 19th Emperor. Oh, so that's her game. What do you think? Will you accept her offer? Sounds like a good deal to me... Allow me to ask you one question. Do you know who it was that assassinated General Osaibi? Well, when we attacked the Hokuban Gate, General Osaibi, who should have been protecting it, had already been assassinated. In other words, we made it this far thanks to the person who assassinated General Osaibi. We'd really like to thank whoever it was. Wouldn't you? Oh, then you owe your gratitude to Empress Dowager Kin. She planned the act with Minister Seitono. You're sure of this? Yes. I played a role in the matter as well. Captain, take that man away and have him beheaded! Why?! Why would you do that? Because you annoy me! Spare me! Please, don't behead me! No! No! Trash. Kon, why'd you do that? General Osaibi was an upright and honest tactician. Anyone who would assassinate such a fine man with the enemy on the way is a real black-hearted scoundrel. Having someone like that nearby would put you in danger too, Brother. Oh, I get you! Hey, and after you cut off that bum's cucumber head, pickle it and send it back to the Empress Dowager! Mother. You have been asked to evacuate, yet still you remain? This place has grown dangerous. You can hear them, yes? That rebellion army out there is trampling on the Sokan Castle we have worked so hard to build. It will be sad to see it destroyed. It is with heartache that I now remember my predecessor's words that a country that wars with itself is vulnerable to external attack. When I look back, I realize what a fool I was. Rather than running away, I should have spoken with you about ensuring the future of our country. But these are merely my final regrets. As Sokan's final emperor, I will share the fate of my castle. You should take my brother and flee. Mother?! We did it! The angle was a bit high. I think I've got the hang of it. It was a huge success, though! That's one entrance to the inner palace blocked! We just need to do the Weeping Gate! Come on, bring the cannon! I'm told there are over 1,000 beauties in the inner palace. Listen, everyone! No keeping any of them for yourselves! If you catch a woman, you bring her to me first! Go! Yeah, right! Who cares about orders when there's beautiful women ahead? There's a thousand of them! We'll all have our pick to choose from! How many is that apiece, I wonder? I can't help but drool when I think about it! I can't wait! Gunpowder ready. Cannonball ready. Angle ready. This tunnel's pretty long, huh? Who created this damned thing? What's the big deal? The anticipation just makes it more exciting! Keep calm a little longer. It says not to light it until the last possible moment. The way out! The women! Yahoo! What?! Light it! What the... General. We can't use this gate... This is where the God of Thunder lives! So we can't invade the inner palace from behind, eh? Pull! Pull! Hurry up and climb! First to those 1,000 beauties gets first pick! Stop pushing me! Fire! Next! The enemies are swarming like ants out there. Try to load them a little faster! Yes, my Hinhi! Hinhi? Who cares about titles right now?! This is pathetic! Why do I have to be reduced to this? Load it! Yes, yes, yes, my Saijin! This one, too! Quick! Yes, yes, yes, my Fujin! Dammit... A woman! A man! Don't be like that, fool. I give up. Those inner palace women are tough. We're not making any progress! They seem to be using cannons and rifles. Kon, can't you think up a plan? About that, Brother... You've got an idea? I think it's about time to give up the rebellion game. We had a lot of fun playing. You're not bored anymore, right? What are you talking about? This isn't a game! I'm gonna be the emperor of this country! Emperor? Why'd you laugh? What's so funny, Kon? Is it funny for me to be emperor? Listen, Brother. Being emperor is a boring job. Why don't we just gather everything worth anything and go back to Kasai Village? We can have a little fun on the way back, too! No way! I'm gonna be emperor! I'll never go back to the country! In all the time we've known each other, we've never disagreed before... Sitting in that seat just means another Iryuda will come after you in the future. I won't let it go! Until I command the whole world from this room, I will never leave this chair! Being emperor, Heisho... It requires a certain character. What is it? Oh, it's... I am Koryun, Emperor of Sokan. I wish to speak with General Iryuda. Take me to him. What's it about? I'll give him the castle. He can kill me if he wishes, too. In exchange, he must halt his attacks on the inner palace and spare all those inside. Koryun! Tamyun's dead? Ginga! Emergency! The emperor has gone to speak to Iryuda! Koryun has? But why? He saw you girls exhausted from the fight, so he's negotiating a ceasefire. But the enemies are still attacking! That's why I'm worried! That man calls himself a general, but he's just leader of a pack of ruffians! I don't think he's going to negotiate! I'll go! Go? Where? I'm going to have a word with this man named Iryuda. That's reckless! Ginga! I am Gin Seihi, first wife of Sokan's 18th Emperor. We cannot continue fighting forever. If the emperor is trying to find a way to save us all, then so will I. Ginga... I am Gin Seihi. I wish to talk to your leader. Take me to him. I-If you touch me, I'll kill myself! The Empress of Sokan has come as a messenger for the inner palace. If you kill me, you'll be disgracing Iryuda's name. Is your general in here? Thank you for your help. You may go. Go! Iryuda, I must speak with you! I'm not Iryuda. He's sitting on the emperor's throne, drunk on delusions of grandeur. Oh? Aren't you... Hey, I remember you! What was it, again... Ginga! That muddy radish we met in Kasai Village! And you're Konton! Why are you working with Iryuda? He gave himself that fancy name, but that's just Heisho. Remember him? You mean that big fat guy? I see. So you became empress? I see! Well, I had a good feeling about you back then. I'd totally forgotten about you. Your husband is in the stable there. Hold on a minute. Iryuda plans to make himself emperor. He locked your husband up there, waiting for the right time to kill him. You want to see him? We weren't trying to ruin your happiness. But now that that's how things turned out, I won't make excuses. Once history goes off the track, it can't be restored. Expect this to be the last time you see the emperor. I suppose I'll stand guard for a while. I'm sorry. There was nothing I could do... Why did you go to see Iryuda without telling me? Why didn't you talk to me first? Did you forget that I'm your wife? You are still a child. You cannot understand the world of adults. I'm not a child! I'm not! I'm not a child anymore! Ginga. I guess I was wrong to pin my dreams on those ever-changing clouds. I hurt that child and lost a friend for life. This is the same sort of gun you used before. It can only be fired once. But it might startle the guards. Run. You have to. Kenton. Thank you. It's nothing. Wow, you smell like manure! No... No! It can't be! Koryun? Koryun! I gave that so that you could survive! Because I wanted you to survive! I wanted us all to live through this... Koryun... Ginga. I'll try to save the women of the inner palace. But don't be mad if I fail. What's going on? Hey! Brother! Kon! Stay back. If you come any closer, I'll kill him! Release everyone in the inner palace at once! If you don't, I'll kill him! Do what she says! I don't wanna die! How can you say that? There are tons of pretty girls in there! Please, Brother! Are you just gonna let me die? How long have we known each other? You really want me to die a dog's death like this? Aren't we sworn brothers? Well? Shall I kill your sworn friend? Or will you spare my people? Help me, please! I don't wanna die! Darn it! Fine! Stop crying, it's pathetic! I'll release them. I'll release the women of the inner palace. Dammit... Will that do it, Kon? My hand almost went numb. But I guess it worked! Yeah, thanks to our accomplice. The hammer on this gun was already down. Iryuda probably knew it wasn't loaded. If he knew that, then why... A farewell gift to me, I suppose. We've known each other for so long... Don't glare like that, you guys! Look, those girls all belonged to the last emperor anyway. Just watch. I'll collect my own group of smoking hot chicks! A consort hunt! Iryuda, having overthrown Sokan Castle, formed a new court called "Shinshu," and became its first Emperor. But three years later, before he had time to warm his throne, he was driven out, and executed in his home town, Kasai Village. The country then entered a period of civil war, until the great warlord Kokuyoju took up the work of uniting the country. In 1638, this same Kokuyoju declared himself Emperor Jinmu, and formed a new court in Hokushi at the former Sokan Castle. He was the child of Ginga and Koryun, the fruit of their lone tryst in the stables. As for Ginga herself, her wild and free behavior became the source of many legends, but those who knew her all said one thing: That no matter when they met her, Ginga always seemed young and full of life. It seems Ginga remained her childlike self for her entire life. odoroite imasu ka kyuu ni tabi ni deta koto Are you surprised that I suddenly went off traveling? hitori de aruku michi ha nazeka tooi kedo Though for some reason, the road feels so very long when I walk it alone... itsu no hi ka kokoro no sukitootta kaban ni Some day, I want to put the people that I love aisuru hito wo irete anata ni aitai into the clear travel bag of my heart, and go to see you kizukanai uchi ni kawatteku ashita Tomorrow will change before you realize it kirei da to iwarete naitari I'm the type who cries when I'm told I'm pretty kami wo kiri genki ni nattari and feels better when I cut my hair... ano kumo no youni jiyuu ni As free as those clouds in the sky yakusoku mo shinai dokokade In some place where promises don't matter ano kumo no youni kirameku I'll be shining like those clouds watashi wo mitsukete Come find me! tomadotte imasu ka konna tegami yondara Does reading this letter make you feel uncertain? mou sugu kataomoi mo waratte hanaseru Soon, I'll be able to laugh and talk about even my one-sided feelings atarashii koi wo kakinareru made ha Until I'm used to writing about new romances anata yori sei ga hikui toka I'll end up talking about everything that makes me nervous, tokimeki wo kurabete shimau ne like the fact that I'm shorter than you... soyokaze no youni sunao ni As honest as a passing breeze sono machi wo sugita dokokade I'll pass through this town and end up somewhere else soyokaze no youni dareka ni Like the passing breeze, I want to tell someone suki da yo iitai that I still love them. ano kumo no youni jiyuu ni As free as those clouds in the sky yakusoku mo shinai dokokade In some place where promises don't matter ano kumo no youni kirameku I'll be shining like those clouds watashi wo mitsukete Come find me!
