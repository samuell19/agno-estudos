NARRATOR: Michelle Payne was just six months old when her mother Mary died in a car accident, leaving her father, Paddy, a single dad to ten children ranging in age from 16 to a tiny baby. PADDY: She was being breastfed when her mother was killed, and, uh, that was a worry. But she came through it good, took the bottle straightaway. MICHELLE: I think all the kids helped out and it wasn't too bad. Bernadette used to look after me. [CHUCKLES] Stevie and I were the little kids, so we'd always get left out most of the time, but we still had a lot of fun. NARRATOR: The bond between Stevie and his little sister was plain to see. MICHELLE: Growing up in a family of ten kids is like you would imagine. Without our mum in our lives, it was just crazy, hectic as anything. Everybody had to work at the stables. It was just like everybody had their set chores and we all had to work. That was just the way it was. NARRATOR: Eight of Paddy's ten children became jockeys. INTERVIEWER: What do you find the hardest part? MICHELLE: Probably keeping my weight down. - INTERVIEWER: Were you always going to be a jockey? - Yep. INTERVIEWER: Did you ever think of doing anything else? Um... no, not at all. [CHUCKLES] INTERVIEWER: What sort of jockey would you like to be? I just want to win the Melbourne Cup.

Could hear your girls screaming at each other from the other side of the track, Paddy. Wouldn't be my girls, Joanie. [LAUGHS] I got you two an ice cream. Andrew's coming last. Good for Andrew. They're bunched tight on the turn. JOANIE: Shelly...

Shiva's Revenge, a Cummings quinella! - Third, Magnolia Hall and then- - [BELL RINGS] Patrick come last. PADDY: Yep. How can a horse that was winning come last? PADDY: Because he went fast at the wrong end of the race. Yep. That's the Melbourne Cup. It's an upside-down race. Anyway, if you can go from first to last, no reason you can't go from last to first.

She had a fall! ANNOUNCER: She's not moving. This looks to be a nasty one as the ambulance attendants... [CELLPHONE RINGS] I know. I know. I'm on my way. Oh, shit! Andrew! Michelle's had a fall. Michelle Payne still unresponsive. [HEART MONITOR BEEPS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] Tell me she's alive. - What's the story? - She in surgery? - We don't know yet. - PATRICK: Is it her neck? Have you heard from Dad yet? - No. Have you seen him? - It's okay. Anyone see her fall? Where's the doctor? Is he here? - CATHY: Here's Dad now. - Who are we speaking to? - I heard it was bad. - CATHY: It looked really bad. PATRICK: Hey, mate. CATHY: Dad, they've intubated her and they're trying to stabilize her, but we don't know anything else yet. For the moment, she's better in a comatose state. The scans reveal a lot of bleeding inside and outside the brain, and there is some evidence of damage to the right frontal lobe. - What does that mean? - DOCTOR: It means we wait. The blood clots will slowly reabsorb and we'll be able to assess the extent of Michelle's damage. I'm sorry it's not great news. [SIGHS] [TRASH CAN CLATTERS NOISILY] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [VENTILATOR HISSES] It's your mum's. I was selfish, I know that. But I was right. If... If... If only I hadn't let her go. No, stop kicking yourself, Paddy. You've done a grand job under impossible circumstances. I've lost two of them, Father. You're a good man, Paddy. God sees that. It's not God's forgiveness I'm after. Come on. Let's pray for her together. BOTH: Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus... [COUGHS] Yeah, much better now. Hey, Stinky. Hey? Why the hell are you giving her that? Thought it might cheer her up. She can't read, you moron. You know, even if she could, it's the last thing she should be reading. - Coffee? - Sure. Okay. In the second at Doomben, we've got C. Webb on Craig-Lee Rubble. I hear he goes like the clappers. NURSE: Ready? Gently, gently. THERAPIST: Can you lift that hand for me, Michelle? [GRUNTS] Good girl. Tell me... do you remember how to spell your name? M... I... THERAPIST: That's okay. How many fingers am I holding up? MICHELLE: Th... THERAPIST: That's enough for today. You did really well. And we'll carry on tomorrow. Who won the 1983 Melbourne Cup? Kiwi. Jockey? MICHELLE: Jimmy 'Pumper' Cassidy. 1930? - MICHELLE: Phar Lap. - Colors? Crimson, black-white sleeves. See, you've got to ask some questions that she might at least be interested in. PADDY: Righto, Stevie. All right, mate. [GRUNTS] Here. Right, let's have you, little girl. [MICHELLE GRUNTS] - [MICHELLE GRUNTS] - There you go. Good. Okay, mate. Yeah, Andrew made that. [SIGHS] [SOFTLY] Shit! - [FRIDGE DOOR CLOSES] - MICHELLE: [GROANS] DOCTOR: Well done. You've made great progress, Michelle. But another injury to the head could be fatal. You've got to do whatever you can to protect it. When can I ride again? [CHUCKLES] [NICKERS] [HORSE NEIGHS] MICHELLE: [SOFTLY] Hi. CATHY: You're out of your mind. Get married, go travelling and have kids. There's a reason they call it the most dangerous sport on earth. - [SIGHS] - Who'll look after you if you're permanently brain-damaged? Paralyzed? Dad can't. I will. JOAN: Shelly, I can't be part of this anymore. If I get you a ride and something happens... So, what do you want me to do? Go back to being the youngest of ten, doing as I'm told by everybody else? Like you ever did what you were told! MICHELLE: I don't see you telling your husbands to give up, - and they've all been injured. - CATHY: Dad, please, just tell her. I did try to do that once. Didn't work out so well. No. If that little girl's made up her mind... there's no-one here or in heaven that can make her change it.

[CLICKS TONGUE] What are you doing in there? What's going on? [SNORTS, STAMPS FOOT] What's wrong? What's wrong, buddy? [HORSE NEIGHS] DARREN: His name is Prince of Penzance. He's had more medical issues than you. It's a shame you're out of action. Could have taken him for a spin. I'm not out of action. I'm just on a break. Doctor's given me a month. [LAUGHS] Okay. [DOOR OPENS] WOMAN: Prince's injury's healing nicely. I've put it up for you. - DARREN: Good. Thanks, darl. - [DOOR CLOSES] DARREN: You can take him down to the beach if you like. [LAUGHS] MICHELLE: Beautiful boy! [LAUGHS] We'll see if that eases the tendon. - Where's Stevie? - MICHELLE: I have to ride that horse. That is probably the best horse I've ever ridden. Hey, Dusty, when you've finished your little beauty treatment, take Trident out for a trot and see if the hindquarters are still tight. DUSTY: No worries, Mr. Weir. "Mister"? Do I look like a bank manager to you, Mick? - Not to me. - Good. MICHELLE: Darren? Darren! You're still following me, aren't you? I will do whatever it takes. I will drive every day to Warrnambool. - DARREN: [SIGHS] - I have to ride that horse. Michelle. You've fractured your skull. Now your back. Both your elbows. Your neck. Is there any part of you that's not damaged? My ability to win. Fine. You can bunk in with Stevie. But... no promises. You won't regret it, Mr. Weir! [LAUGHS] You'll regret calling me that. Don't. - DARREN: Don't. Good. - MICHELLE: Yep. MICHELLE: [LAUGHS] Yes! STEVIE: You're looking good. MICHELLE: That's it, boy. Oh, much stronger, Prince. - STEVIE: Looking really good. - MICHELLE: Much better. - That's it, boy. - STEVIE: That's it, boy! He's getting better. Good as new. - Good boy. - MICHELLE: Good boy. Whoa! Maddy, can you take him down to the water walker? - Put him on for ten minutes. - MADDY: Yep. - DARREN: He looks good. - MICHELLE: Yeah. Let's try him on a short run. ANNOUNCER: ...Spirit pulled out, raced up, but Prince of Penzance has beaten off Laid Back Larry! Prince of Penzance and Oregon Spirit. Down to the back, 50 to go. Prince of Penzance digs in hard, finds plenty, and the Prince gets in by three-quarters of a length to Oregon Spirit! In the running, here comes the Prince. He said, "See you later, boys." He moves up on the outside and, in a bonanza performance, goes home and wins well... MAN: You managed him beautifully in the final 400, Shell. He sure runs well for you. - Cheers! - Sure does. - Michelle Payne. - Michelle Payne! ANNOUNCER: [ON RADIO] Now looking at the Moonee Valley Cup, a qualifying race for the Melbourne Cup, and Opinion is the favorite. Prince of Penzance, Michelle Payne, four runs back from a spell. He's had his issues with injuries, but he might be a chance here. This distance looks ideal for him. Ready to go. They're off and racing. And Opinion jumping well over on the outside, the favorite... Opinion got away well, and going through is Black Tycoon soon after the start. Precedence is now drifting back. Black Tycoon, Au Revoir, Albonetti are up there ahead of Epingle and Le Roi, who holds the rails. [HOOVES THUDDING] ANNOUNCER: And on the outside, Prince of Penzance strikes hard! Prince of Penzance draws away and wins it for Michelle Payne! ANNOUNCER: Your attention, please. There's a protest. A protest on the Moonee Valley Cup... Don't antagonize them. We need this win if he's gonna get a run in the Melbourne Cup. Just keep your cool. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Come in, riders. Clearly, there was insufficient room for you to take the run. There was room when I went. The runners ahead of me shifted position and it closed. Michelle, you of all people should know better than to put other jockeys at risk. I didn't. Okay, let's... let's have another look. Bernie? [MAN CLEARS THROAT] MAN 1: This will tell the story. MAN 2: She isn't holding the line at all. - MAN 1: That gap's tight. - MAN 2: Gutsy. She's forced Damien over so far... MAN 1: No, look at her! She's... ALL: Ooh! STEWARD: You are charged with careless riding. Any jockey worth their salt would have taken that run! STEWARD: Are you telling me how to do my job? No. No, I'm just saying that... the gap was there when I went. Just keep your cool. Keep your cool. You're suspended for 20 meets. MICHELLE: I did not cause that fall! If that was an appeal... - it's denied. - This is not fair! STEWARD: Do you want me to make it 40 meets? I'm taking this to the tribunal. Oh, and how many times have you done that, Michelle? Dismissed. What about the win? Rich? [ALL CHEER] MAN: Well done, Darren! MAN: Congratulations! Next stop, Melbourne Cup! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I'm sorry, Michelle. But you are the one that's suspended. Not that horse. I just qualified him for the Melbourne Cup. So, what do you want me to do? Sit him in a paddock for 20 meets? I've been on every one of his starts. I have had six wins. Yeah. It was all you. Dunno why they pay me. STEVIE: Okay, Maddy. DARREN: Keep going, Drew. I'm proud of you. Yeah. - DARREN: All good, Drew? - DREW: Yeah. STEVIE: See you, Michelle. Come on. Close up. [CELLPHONE RINGS] Hello? PADDY: I am not dead yet and I do not want to be resuscitated. If the Lord's will is that I go, I go. So just don't let them put me under the knife. I don't want it. Barry over there's crook as a dog, but I'm-- ANDREW: Dad, just calm down, all right? You've had a heart attack. I'm all right, aren't I, Nursie? If the Lord wants me, he can have me. No, Dad. The Lord doesn't want you. I've lived a full life. Well... I did want to see you settled down and happy, like your sisters. It's okay, Dad. I've found the one. I just... just hope he's good enough for you. Oh, he is, Dad. He's a Prince. How many legs has he got? [LAUGHS] NURSE: Excuse me, guys? He really does need his rest. I'll give you a call if anything changes. See you tomorrow, Dad. See you, Dad. STEVIE: Michelle? MICHELLE: Yeah? What will happen if Dad goes away? What will happen with me then? I'll look after you, buddy. Because you haven't got a boyfriend. [BOTH GIGGLE] MICHELLE: [LAUGHS] No! No, you dingbat! [LAUGHS] No. 'Cause you're my best friend. And... we're gonna build a home, and I'll have a ton of horses. I'll train 'em up and you'll be my number one strapper. What will happen if you die? [PHONE RINGS] - Hello? - THERESE: Michelle? Michelle, he's gone. [SOBS] THERESE: Michelle? [THERESE SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] Stewards and doctors! They know stuff-all! Go fight for your Prince, love. DARREN: She's served her suspension. She was the one that qualified your horse for the Melbourne Cup by taking risks. So why not take one on her? We've put thousands into this broken horse's medical bills. - Three bone chip operations. - Major abdominal surgery. Six years old. It's a miracle he's racing. - Exactly. - This is our last chance to make something back. And if he doesn't end up in the top ten, that's money we'll never see again. Face facts - no woman jockey's even come close to winning the Melbourne Cup. It all comes down to strength in that last 100 meters. Bottom line, she's too reckless. That's why she got susp-- You've never had a problem with me riding Prince. And now all of a sudden you want to replace me. Why? Shell, it's nothing personal. We're just trying to give the horse his best chance. I have ridden him in almost every race. I get that horse and he gets me. He's mine. The Cup is a hard race. You need strength. I'll tell you what you need. You think it's all about strength. It is about so much more than that. You need to understand your horse. You need the skill to read the field. And most of all... you need to be patient! And if you all think differently, then... well, then... you're all a bunch of bloody idiots! Do you want to know how to win the biggest race in the world? Like that. Busy Cup Day? Are you for real? [CHUCKLES] You're on. - G'day, Darren. - Hey, Neil. If you get barrier 18, just put it back. Okay. Yes. 'Cause no horse has ever won from 18. - Stevie? - Yep? - Where's your tie? - I don't wear ties. - Why? - I don't like 'em. Neither do I. All right, you need to get me one or two, okay? STEVIE: Okay. I'll get number one. PRESENTER: [ON TV] And the best strapper in the business, Stevie Payne, is gonna come forward and pick the barrier. Steve told me he's after barrier one or two. - And he's picked barrier one! - [CHEERING] PRESENTER: He has the magic touch, your brother.. [SIGHS] PADDY: The only thing that matters is the odds you give yourself. [CELLPHONE CHIMES] What do you think his chances are, Stevie? I reckon he'll beat the lot of 'em! Well, in that case... I know you don't like them, but today, you might have to make an exception. [GIGGLES] There we go. Load it up. [CELLPHONE RINGS] MICHELLE: Hi, Therese. Yes. Yes, I've eaten. Uh, a Berocca and a Coke Zero. [LAUGHS] That... That does so count! Okay. Bye. [CELLPHONE RINGS] Patrick. [LAUGHS] Hi. Don't go too early. I know. I got it. Thanks. Bye. Could you tell me what the odds are on Prince of Penzance, please? Ooh. Impossible to one? Nah. Female rider, up against D. Oliver and F. Dettori? But, happy to take your money! Come on! Come on! Ooh! I'd like to place $5 on her each way, please. It's a boy horse, ma'am. I know it is. I'm placing it on the girl. Ah. $5 it is. Love a woman who throws caution to the wind. Actually, make it ten... each way. No, 20. The win. [PUNCHES KEYS] Thank you. JOANIE: Sister. [TYRES SCREECH] [SCOOTER BEEPS] - Morning, Trevor. - Good morning, Sister. Number 19, Prince of Penzance. [COINS CLATTER] $148.55. For the win. She's one of yours, is she? Thanks, Trevor. [SCOOTER BEEPING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SILENCE] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SILENCE] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BUGLE PLAYS FIRST CALL] [COMMENTARY PLAYS ON TV] [TONE SOUNDS OVER P.A.] P.A.: Jockeys to the mounting yard now. All Melbourne Cup jockeys to the mounting yard. [BUGLE PLAYS FIRST CALL] ANNOUNCER: [OVER P.A.] Ladies and gentlemen, it's time now to meet the jockeys aiming to write their name into the record books as the winner of the 155th Emirates Melbourne Cup. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Number 8, Max Dynamite, Willie Mullins. Ollie! Ridden by international star of the turf, Frankie Dettori. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Number 13, The Offer, the legendary trainer Gai Waterhouse, Damien Oliver! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Ollie! Twenty-three of the 24 riders are male. Just the fifth female to ride in the race, say hello to a young lady, Michelle Payne-- - [CHEERING] Come on, Michelle! - ANNOUNCER: ...Prince of Penzance. A girl's never gonna win the Melbourne Cup, mate. Not in my lifetime. I could improve those odds. ANNOUNCER: Number 23, Excess Knowledge, ridden by the man who won the 2000 Cup aboard Brew, Kerrin McEvoy. DARREN: Don't go too hard too fast. You want to be between 8th and 14th. On the fence, smothered away. Yeah, okay. What are we at? Hundred to one. You'd be at half that if you were a bloke. Just try and finish in the top ten. - All right? - MICHELLE: Right. - Good luck, Michelle. - Good luck, Shelly. - Hey, sis. - Good luck, Shell. - MAN: Good luck, Kerrin. - WOMAN: Hey, Kerrin! - Hey, good luck out there. - Hey, Shelly! - MAN: Good luck with 18. - See you on the other side. [CHUCKLES] - WOMAN: Good luck out there! - Bye. [WHISPERS] Hey, boy! Hey, boy. Hey, Prince. Beautiful boy. - STEVIE: Nice boy. - [PRINCE SNORTS] - Stevie? - Yeah? Can I do this? I know the horse can. He's gonna be a champion. BOTH: A champion! [BOTH GIGGLE] [SIGHS] Let's do this. BRUCE MCAVANEY: [ON TV] ...champion rider. So, Ollie, for Gai Waterhouse, on The Offer. SIMON O'DONNELL: Look, I'm sure, even though Gai is probably the most positive person I've ever met in my life, she would have liked the skies to have opened and taken some cut out of this ground and given the horse his best chance, 'cause that's where he's a chance of running a place in the Melbourne Cup if the ground's wet. - It's not today. - MCAVANEY: He won the Sydney Cup last year. This year's Sydney Cup winner is Grand Marshal... [JOCKEYS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, Ollie, you want me to stay up with her? MAN 1: Riders up the back! Come on! Come a bit closer! Go on! Move up again, please! Get closer! Thank you! MAN 2: Come on. [HORSE SNORTS] - Good boy. - MAN 2: In you go. In you go. - Good boy. - MAN 2: Come on. That's it. MAN 1: We'll have to lock behind this one. Keep coming. Keep coming! - MAN 1: All right, a bit further. - MAN 2: Yeah, locked in. MAN 2: Grab her head. Grab her head. Come on, go in. Come on. Up you get. MAN: Hang on. Hang on! JOCKEY: Can I have a hand? Can I have a hand? [HUFFS] Mum, Brig, stay with me. Stay with me. [WHISPERS] That's a good boy. There's a good boy. Make sure you give Max a good ride, 'cause I'm following you. What are you doing after the race? Celebrating. MAN: Clear! [CROWD CHEERS] ANNOUNCER: The Offer jumped well with Trip to Paris. Prince of Penzance missed the start from the inside gate. Who Shot Thebarman got away nicely - from Criterion and Sertorius. - [CROWD CHEERING] ANNOUNCER: Over on the outside, and Quest for More going forward with Big Orange. [HOOVES THUDDING] ANNOUNCER: ...as they both go up towards the frontrunners. It's a bunched field at the 2,800, joining the course proper. And Quest for More led narrowly from Big Orange, Excess Knowledge, Snow Sky and Criterion. Max Dynamite getting back, and so too is Red Cadeaux, Preferment, Who Shot Thebarman and The United States. They're followed by Hartnell. Bondi Beach a good way back in the field. Behind them is Hokko Brave and Almoonquith. They're followed by Kingfisher. They've settled fully. Not a lot of pace about. - MAN: Come on! - And the favorite, Fame Game, has only four or five behind him. Quest for More has a narrow lead, being pressured on the outside by Excess Knowledge and Big Orange. Trip to Paris is up there with Criterion, Grand Marshal and Sertorius, followed by Our Ivanhowe... That's good. ANNOUNCER: ...and then followed by Gust of Wind... - [HOOVES THUDDING] - [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] ANNOUNCER: ...on the fence, followed by Trip to Paris, Max Dynamite... - Come on! Go, Brett! - Go, Kerry! PADDY: Not yet, not yet. Not yet. Wait for the sweet spot. Come on! ANNOUNCER: ...to Paris is coming into the race. Snow Sky's wide out... Come on, Stinky, get out of there! Come on, Michelle. Where are you? ANNOUNCER: ...Fame Game and The Offer, and then Sky Hunter... Get out of there! ANNOUNCER: ...Big Orange still narrowly from Excess Knowledge. Snow Sky a bit wider. Trip to Paris joining in... PADDY: Not yet, not yet... No! No! Now! Take it! Run! Take it! PADDY: Suddenly a gap opens. That's God talking to you, and you'd better listen to God, because he will close that gap quicker than you can say your mother's name. [♪♪] - Go! - Guys? You've found it, little girl! ANNOUNCER: Criterion trying to find a way through. Round the outside came Sky Hunter and Bondi Beach off the track is making ground too. - Our Ivanhowe... - Come on, Michelle! - Yes! Come on! - Come on! Let him go! ANNOUNCER: ...on the extreme outside with The Offer... - Come on! - Come on! ANNOUNCER: Snow Sky joining in and now Trip to Paris is comin. They're followed then by Who Shot Thebarman. Going for a run on the inside is Our Ivanhowe. Coming past the 300 meters, Excess Knowledge with the lead narrowly. Here's Prince of Penzance coming on down the outside. Prince of Penzance for Michelle Payne. Now Max Dynamite starts to charge home. Prince of Penzance from Max Dynamite. Prince of Penzance! It's history at Flemington! Michelle Payne! [♪] [SCREAMS] [SHRIEKS] - Yeah! - Yes! ANNOUNCER: Michelle Payne has created history at Flemington. The first lady to win the Melbourne Cup! [♪] Thank you, girls. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JOCKEY: Michelle! Great ride! MCAVANEY: Prince of Penzance, a horse that's been dogged by injury, came back. He really got himself into the Cup with that great run at Moonee Valley. And this young lady, who's ridden the horse 22 times before today, and the best thing possible in Australian racing and nearly the world now, to the Melbourne Cup. [ALL LAUGH] Whoo! That was a great win. Great ride. Ten out of ten. - Correct weight! - [CHEERING] [♪] - Woohoo! - [ALL CHEER] [BREATHES HEAVILY] STEVIE: Woohoo! - [CAR HORN TOOTS] - STEVIE: Whoo! Woohoo! I reckon this one can go... here. You went a bit early. Couldn't wait. You never could. Do you want to give me a hand getting Andrew's horses up from the bottom paddock? - Yeah. - PADDY: Righto. MICHELLE: I put in all the effort I could. I galloped him every gallop he had and did everything I could to stay on him, because I thought he had what it takes to run a race in the Melbourne Cup and, um, I just wanted to say that everyone else can get stuffed, 'cause they think women aren't strong enough, but we just beat the world. MICHELLE: Our family's so blessed to have Stevie and to share that experience with him, who we've been so close our whole lives. And it's just funny to think two little kids that used to run around together, on the main stage beating all the horses that come from around the world, is absolutely incredible.
