FOR MY SON Attention! I didn't mean to. It's OK, sweetheart, it happens to everyone. -Even you? -Yes, even Dad. Just not in the sky. That's true. Watch your back. Careful! -Got him! -You killed me! I want to be a soldier too when I grow up. Your mom won't like that. I have a present for you. Thanks, Malik. Now you can meet up with Guillaume in heaven. That's kind of you. Of course, you're my godfather. Don't worry about Guillaume. My mom will take care of him up there. He's going to be fine. There you are. I told you to stay with me. Can you give me a few more moments? I'll be right down. OK. Come. His ex-wife, I don't know. I don't know him well. I don't know how you get over something like this. Paul. It's your fault he died. I've always begged you. I didn't want him to become a soldier. Marion. Marion! I'm sorry, Paul. Matignon just announced that their first meeting will take place next Monday. A picture now, this morning's funeral of a young soldier from Charente, member of the special forces. He was killed in Mali during a major military operation. The French army was able to eliminate one of the main donors to Jihad, Oumar Kaïtané. His gold reserve was confiscated. It was used to finance terrorism in the Sahel. A victory for France but unfortunately tainted by the death of the soldier. He was 25 years old. An innovation in healthcare... DRONE SQUADRON COGNAC-CHATEAUBERNARD BASE Commander. The pilot felt a vibration in the tires. It's nothing serious, but we're looking into it. It was just in maintenance. Everything should be normal. Repeat the tests. Thank you. Very well. My respects, Colonel. Sit down, Commander. All right. I just read the DRSD report. It confirms what we already knew. Your son and Kaïtané killed each other. He died a hero. I'd like to read the report myself, Colonel. Can I see the footage of the operation? No, I don't think that's a good idea. But these were my drones. I trained this crew. I have the most experience in this squadron. I think I can analyze this footage with a fresh eye. Except that usually, this footage isn't about an event that is so close to you. What are you looking for? I would've liked to be present during the operation. I sent my son into the lion's den. I need to see that footage. I'll give you two hours. Not a minute more. Thank you, Colonel. -Commander. -Lieutenant Perez. Is there a problem, Sonia? Guillaume was like a little brother to me. Please spare me... You were the sensor operator on the mission. I need you to tell me. Sorry. -What was that? Shots? -Negative. The assault hadn't even begun. -Show me again. -OK. It could be a flashlight or a flickering neon light. That's Guillaume. I'm so sorry. It wasn't a light but a gunshot. Kaïtané was dead before my son got there. What? Go back. Stop. It's a gunshot, before our men arrived. That's the jihadists fleeing. Look at this guy. He has something heavy in his bag. -Can you zoom in? -Yes. That's a Vendéen heart, isn't it? Can't be very common in Mali. Guillaume wasn't killed by Kaïtané but by the guy with the tattoo. -The video is inconclusive. -Kaïtané's treasure. If we compare with the Americans' estimates, about twenty ingots are missing. Americans exaggerate. That's nothing new. You're showing bad faith, Colonel. My apologies. My son wasn't killed by Kaïtané, I'm sure of it. The ballistics report is clear. Kalachnikov. AKSU 223, 5.56 by 45mm. Your son was killed by Oumar Kaïtané in a crossfire. Maybe they swapped the weapons. When I look at you, I see a father looking for a culprit because he can't handle the truth. Drop it. You should see someone. The Army Medical Corps shrink is very good. It's an order. I see! -Take it easy. -Come on, I've never been drunk. Never? I'll remind you of a certain evening where you ended up naked on the roof of a church. We were 15 years old. The statute of limitations has expired. Is Marion still mad at me? She feels bad about slapping you. Give her time. She'll be fine. Guillaume didn't die the way I was led to believe. Meaning? I'll have to investigate to find out what happened. Do you have the approval of your hierarchy? It's just the opposite. Dambreuse wants me to see a shrink. All right. Listen, Paul. This isn't your friend talking but the lawyer. My advice is to stop this. You can't investigate behind the military's back. You're right. -What does that mean? -Forget it. Well, I have to go. If you want to come by the shooting range, don't hesitate. It'll take your mind off things. You'll see, I've made some progress. Your shooting club isn't very good. Cops, ex-military, they're good people, right? Paul, let me introduce you to my new baby. I kept the old one for the countryside, I don't want to damage this beauty. So? Do you like it? Let me know about the shooting range. I'll try to work things out with Marion. -Drive carefully. -I promise. -Yes? -Get a hold of Leclerc. On his cell phone. Voicemail, Colonel! Put it through. Leclerc, it's Dambreuse. I just read your letter of resignation. It's nonsense. Call me so we can talk about this. Marion? Can I come in? What's going on? What are you doing? I'm looking for the person who really killed Guillaume. What's the point? He was killed 4,000 miles from home. Who cares who killed him? He's dead. That's all there is to it. I need to know. When you didn't answer your phone, the regiment called me. It's... It's Guillaume's things. Why didn't you tell me you quit? What difference would it have made? I miss Guillaume too. He would've wanted you to be strong, not quit the army. He knew it was your whole life. No. My whole life was you and him. I grabbed... things, souvenirs. I didn't want him to be in the military. You never believed me, but I did everything I could to dissuade him. I tried. I swear. I know. It took me a while to understand that, but I did. I was so angry at you of being less afraid than me that something would happen to him. I regret not being good enough for you. Well, I have to go. You shouldn't stay locked up. You need to get out. Come over for lunch tomorrow. Can I count on you? I've never seen this picture, Sonia. We were 16. I had just arrived here. Maybe a week after the judge granted me my emancipation. Were you and Guillaume ever in love? -Nonsense. You know what? -What? It's a good thing. It would've ruined everything between us. Speaking of pictures, can I show you one? Yes. It's the same tattoo. It is. But is it a mere coincidence, or is it the man who killed Guillaume? What can you tell me about him? Not much. Army, Air Force, we don't socialize. He was friends with Guillaume. I met him twice. A flirt, a little heavy. I didn't understand what Guillaume and his buddies were doing with him. Do you remember his name? Carava. That's it. I talked about him again with Guillaume a few years later. He told me he got kicked out of the army, but he didn't say why. You have some nerves, Leclerc. You put your resignation on my desk, sneak out, don't return my calls. Then you come back for information on a former soldier? A former soldier who could explain what happened during this mission. We all know what happened on that mission. I want to see this through and make peace with it. Did you finally go to the shrink? You're no longer in the military. What I might have given to a deserving commander with an exemplary past, I can't give it to a civilian. He'd already come to my office three times. The balls on that guy! I told you about him, right? No. So he says: "I've told you everything. "This time, I did." Two days later, in the middle of court, he threw an apocalyptic tantrum. He told everyone I botched my work, that I didn't ask him, even though I did two days earlier. Thankfully, the judge didn't buy it... and... I'll stop here. I'm talking too much. -You're not. -Even a little less than usual. You're being kind. Are we still on for the shooting range? Come whenever you want. You know what? I'll go get the little sister. Lucky Luke. You're being nice about the shooting range. I had lunch with Sonia yesterday. She's not doing very well. She feels guilty about Guillaume, that she could've seen something, that she could've warned him. That's ridiculous. That's what I said. Sonia is a strong girl. She went through a lot, not to mention the nightmare she suffered with her violent parents. She'll get it together. She'll be fine. She told me she wanted to leave the army. Is that so? Ladies and gentlemen, if I may. Do you know a sweeter sound than this in the world? Wow! Admire. Well... I was warming up. What about you? All right, I see. That's called class. Wanna go again? I'm feeling this one, I might just leave you in the dust. Alain, don't be mad, but I'm exhausted. Let's go then! No, stay! You can use the practice. Control on your breath, and above all, relax your left hand a little. Thanks, Professor. Don't insist, it's lame. Maïwenn, one year is a big deal. -I don't like anniversaries. -Neither do I. One year is a record for me. It's normal to celebrate, isn't it? Come on, just dinner. It's not like it's... -OK then. -Yes! We'll keep it simple. Candles... What is it? I can't find my IT pass. Maybe you left it at the station. No. I don't think so. Why are you making a complaint? I was attacked in the street. They took my wallet and my cell phone. Wait here. I'll send someone. READING CARD WELCOME, COMMANDER SEARCH PERSONAL RECORDS You could've lost it anywhere. -Why would someone steal it? -I don't know. It's weird, isn't it? Calm down, I'm on your side. Sorry. Commander Castel? Yes? You lost this. -Where did you find it? -Right there, in room five. I haven't been in there in two days. Thank you. See, you found it. BOXING CLUB I see you. Lower your elbow. -Are you in charge here? -Yeah, what is it? My ten-year-old godson would like to take classes. Keep shadow boxing. I don't work with kids. Ask my colleague, Louise. At the front desk. Nice tattoo. Are you former military? Maybe, why? I don't want to leave my godson with just anyone. My son is in the military too. Which branch did you serve in? I don't have time for this. Ask Louise at the front desk about your godson. Garance, put the pads away! YOUR SEARCH HISTORY Clément? Did you send someone to room five this afternoon? -Yeah. -What did he look like? Fifty years old, white, short hair, clean. What did he come for? I don't remember. That's not helpful. -What about the security camera? -Out of order. We're waiting for the provider. It's been three weeks. -Last time, it lasted two months. -What the hell? You're like your son. Always in the wrong place. Who gave you Kaïtané's whereabouts? What do you think? How do you get top secret information? You had an accomplice? He's the one who just came to your house? Commander Leclerc, you're going to jump. I can already see the headlines. "Commander Leclerc, distressed by the death of his son, commits suicide." That'll do, huh? No one will believe I killed myself. Is that so? What about when the cops go to your house and discover your obsession? You went to my house? Come on, Leclerc, jump! It'll only last a second. You'll see your son again. Will you jump? If you want to kill me, do the dirty work yourself. He wanted to push me, but I was able to throw him off. He was a scumbag, but I didn't want that. -It's self-defense. -That's not the point, Alain. It is the point, and that's what you'll tell the cops. They'll never believe me. They'll say I killed Guillaume's killer. All right. What will they say when they find the body? They might not be able to trace it back to Paul. Did anyone know you were looking for him? Sonia, Dambreuse. Sonia won't say anything. Do you think your colonel will talk to the police? I don't know. All the more reason to turn yourself in right away, before they find the body. It'll prove your good faith. If you don't, you'll be charged with premeditation. You won't be doing three years but 30! Do you want to spend the rest of your life in prison? That's what will happen. Why are you upset, Alain? Because he's worried about you. Paul, let me represent you. It's the right thing to do. Please trust me. He has an accomplice who left with the ingots. He told Carava where Kaïtané was. He's probably military. I'll find that bastard. -Then I'll turn myself in. -How will you do it? You'll go to the 200,000 soldiers in France, knock on their door and say: "Excuse me, "do you have any gold in the basement?" I went back to the boxing gym. If he was hanging out with a soldier, they might've been seen together. Alain's right. You have to turn yourself in. I don't want you to die. I wouldn't be able to handle it. I don't want to go back to the cemetery. -You understand? -I know. -Stop pouting. -I'm not pouting. -You're pouting. -No. You are. It's been a year. You won't bring stuff to my house, you don't want me to bring stuff to yours, and you left me alone with my candles for our dinner. I know, it's lame. You didn't come on purpose. Why would I do that? Because you knew I was going to propose. I didn't. OK, maybe a little. You really have issues. You refuse to commit. Right, I have issues. Hi. The owner of the motocross nearby found him this morning while walking his dog. No ID. We don't know his identity yet. It's Franck Carava. Former military, boxing teacher at the Golden Glove. How do you know that? Do you know him? No, I don't know him. Stop. 50, white, short hair. Could be him, right? That should be enough to identify him. Can you print that, please? Had he been working here long? Yes, it had been a while. But Franck didn't have many friends. He was a clumsy flirt, but he never talked about himself. -Did he have any friends or enemies? -No. I did see him fight with a woman once. Brown, mid-length, tied hair, athletic. -Did you know her? -No. But her name's Sonia. That's my mother's name. Thank you. The locker rooms? -Behind you. -OK. PIRATED FACE SCAN Where did you get that software? You don't want to know. Just know your boyfriend's magic. Scum. THE AIR FORCE IS RECRUITING DRONE PILOTS DRS. What the hell is this? What's going on? The less you know, the less you'll mess up. Paul, I'm a lawyer. I'm kind of used to secrets. Stop this bullshit. Turn yourself in to the police. Thanks for the car. Please don't do anything stupid, Paul. Hello, I'm Marion Croze. You wanted to talk to me? Yes. Captain Vaillant, I have a few questions for you. Have you heard from your ex-husband? No, why? Is there a problem? We went to his house. The walls of his living room are covered with pictures, including one of Franck Carava. -Ever heard the name? -Never. Why are you telling me this? Franck Carava's body was found this morning. We think Paul Leclerc killed him, but we don't know why. -Paul didn't kill anyone. -Why do you say that? I was married to him for over 20 years. Mrs. Croze, have you spoken to your ex-husband recently? No. Very well. Listen... if he contacts you, call me. Tell him to surrender. Being on the run rarely ends well. Have a nice day. What are you doing here? What's going on? It's too long to explain. The police are after me. -Why? -Carava. Why didn't you tell me you saw him again here in Cognac a few weeks ago? I didn't. In Carava's boxing club, someone saw a Sonia, young, brown hair, athletic. It wasn't me. Carava had an accomplice, someone on the inside. How else could he have known where Kaïtané was? You think it's me? That I would've betrayed? That I'd do that to Guillaume? Are you serious? I'm sorry. Forgive me. It was dumb of me. You'd never do that. Do you know this guy? Yes. Sylvain Maligneau. Why? He seemed to be buddies with Carava at the time. He may have things to say. They were in the commandos together. I saw him with Guillaume a few times. He flirted a bit... nice, less weird than his buddy. I have his number if you want. Can you set up a meeting with him? OK. Are you sure Leclerc did this? We need to find him to be sure. Would he be capable of doing it? I'm afraid so. Leclerc's not been doing well since the death of his son. What's the connection with Carava? He suspects him of having killed his son. In Mali? Is that possible? No. The mission report is unequivocal. -What do you know about Carava? -Nothing. He was in the army. Don't tell me you didn't look into it. All right. OK. He did two years in the commandos and left. -Why? -I can't tell you. Can't or don't want to? Colonel, I'm going to speak my mind. A former soldier was found dead. Another soldier is suspected of killing him. If you don't want to be accused of covering it up, I advise you to collaborate. Never threaten a soldier. Could we have access to the files of Leclerc and Carava, please? Commander Leclerc's, yes... with an official request. For Carava, contact the army. It's a start. I'd like to speak with Lieutenant Sonia Perez. Why? Leclerc is the godfather of her adopted son, so they're close. Do I need an official request for that too? No need. Commander Leclerc? I'm no longer commander, Staff Sergeant Maligneau. I'm sorry about your son. He was a good man. Do you know the name of Carava? Yes, we hung out with him during our classes. We? Your son, me and other young recruits. He was older than us. He impressed us. We realized he was a jerk. A jerk? His relationship with women, macho to the max. His relationship to command, then he got fired. -Why? -Arms trafficking, his passion. He talked about it for hours. He was reselling old weapons from the Balkan war and guns of the Chechen army too. How did it become known? Have you seen him since military school? No. I heard rumors. What kind of rumors? When I was in Mali, I heard he was around. He was making money by bribing people to promote the adoption of Malians by French people. These are rumors. You know what it's like in the field. You hear all sorts of things. -He's very cute. -Thank you. I had sympathized with his mother. They lived in a village near our camp, and I'd visit them. We had fun. One day, Kaïtané's men attacked and killed women. Malik became an orphan. That's why you adopted him? Yes. It was obvious to me, like something I'd always wanted to do. Commander Leclerc asked his friend, a lawyer, to help me. It was long and chaotic, but we did it. I understand why he's your son's godfather. Sonia, listen to me. Leclerc is in trouble. Help me find him. Do you know the name Franck Carava? -Vaguely. -Vaguely? Someone named Louise Nahmias, who works with him, saw him talking to a woman named Sonia, who looks like you. Still don't know him? I met Carava years ago, and it's not my fault my name is so common nor my body type. I hate to answer the same questions Leclerc asked me. Leclerc? When was that? In the parking lot, an hour ago. Karim, it's me. I'm on my way. There's nothing interesting in Leclerc's file: soldier, like his father, no sanction, honors. Why did Dambreuse hesitate to give you his file? What did you get on Carava? Much more interesting. Five years in the army, two in the commandos. He was fired on suspicion of arms trafficking. He even sued them for wrongful termination. What a joke. Obviously, he lost. What has he been up to lately? A bit of everything... mercenary activities. He was in the area during the operation against Kaïtané. That doesn't matter. It's so different. Anyone could lose it after losing their son. If he's hiding, he must have accomplices. His childhood friend? Which one? Alain Croze, a lawyer. He's his best friend and his ex-wife's new husband. You're telling me this now? Shall we go see him? We have to. CROZE AND ASSOCIATES LAWYERS Never seen him. Never. I took care of Malik's adoption. If someone else had stepped in, I would've known. Sonia was also seen at the boxing club. -She knew where Kaïtané's gold was. -Yes, like other people, given the size of the operation, Paul. There were the commandos, the drone squadron, commanders, Niamey. You're talking about Sonia. I know. I don't know how to help you anymore. Paul, take a break. Not until I solve this case. All right. Do you think the army would want to reopen this case? Even if you bring them proof? You know better than me that they have no interest in doing that. None. You're wasting your time. That's all. Isabelle, do you understand what don't interrupt means? It's the police. Commander Maïwenn Castel and Captain Karim Vaillant would like to speak with you. -That's the cop who's looking for me. -Great. Give me 30 seconds then send them in. Wait. Wait over there. I'll get you after. Mr. Croze. I'm in a hurry, so please hurry. We won't be long. We're here about Commander Leclerc. Who isn't my client. But he's your friend. You married his wife. Are you here to talk about our personal business? No, I would've liked to, but call us if he contacts you. You have to... if you don't want to be accused of complicity. Can I give you my number? -Do you have a pen? -Go ahead. 06-20-48-24-35. All right. -Thanks. Anything else? -One more thing. Do you know Leclerc well? You could say that. I'm puzzled. We had access to his and Carava's files. We may be dealing with a father who has become paranoid, -or a... -Or a hero? Who would like to set the record straight? Let me reassure you, Paul isn't paranoid at all. You're his friend. You wouldn't have said otherwise. Yes. I am his friend. I'd worry about him if I thought he was losing his mind. It's just an office... Just an office. Can I walk you out? We know the way out. COMMANDER CASTEL HONORED FOR HER BRAVERY A MAN COMMITS SUICIDE WITH A SERVICE WEAPON Yes? -Leclerc is at this house. -No joke? Do I cuff him? Wait for us. We're on our way. -Leclerc is at his house. -Fuck. What the hell is he doing? -Yes? -It's Paul Leclerc. It's Leclerc! Yes? I heard you're looking for me. Yes? I assure you, I'm not a paranoid father. Did you hear that? I won't kill anyone or commit suicide. I understand your concern given your personal history. Meaning? I've been doing a little research on you. Your brother's accident, then your father's suicide. What do you want, Mr. Leclerc? Why did you call? I want to trust your honesty, Commander. I can find out what happened to my son. I need you to push for this truth. Fine by me. I'll listen to you and help you. Come by the station. We don't know each other well enough for me to trust you that much. I had a drone when Carava tried to kill me. Find it, or what's left of it, near the cliff where Carava's body was found. Hopefully, the footage will prove my innocence. Goodbye, miss. Floor it! Hello, Greg? He's about to get away! Are you an idiot or what? Are you dumb? Yeah. -He must've taken the back door. -A back door. Thanks, Sherlock! I found something! Send it to the lab. Tell them it's urgent. The ballistics report is clear. Kalachnikov. AKSU 223, 5.56 by 45mm. Your son was killed by Oumar Kaïtané. What did Leclerc mean? About? Your father's death. There's nothing on this video... nothing to prove his innocence. -I hope you're hungry. -I'm starving. Alain doesn't know I'm here. Why not? He would've told me your bullshit will come back to bite us, that we risk prison for complicity. And yet you came. And yet I came. Marion, Carava killed our son. I know he did. He was killed with a Kalachnikov, an AK 223, his favorite weapon. He only uses that one out of superstition, I guess. With this, I can get the investigation reopened. You're kidding me, Leclerc. The police's looking for you, and you come here. I have proof that Carava killed my son. I'm listening. During his five years in the army, Carava was involved in arms trafficking, Soviet weapons recovered after the Balkan war, mostly Kalachnikovs. KSU 223, 45mm. The same model that killed my son. There were pictures of weapons all over his house. You went to his place? Excuse me. I'm listening. It's Maïwenn Castel. It's about Paul Leclerc. Yes, I think it's here. Do you mean Leclerc? Right. I'm looking at it. Pick it up whenever you want. Stall him. I'm coming. Where were we? Breaking into Carava's house. There were pictures all over the walls. He's always holding the same weapon. A 223? I think Carava killed my son with his Kalach. He then put it in Kaïtané's hands. Do we know what weapons the other terrorists had? I don't know. Stay there. I'll get the mission file. Angoulême Police Station. -How did it go? -Great. How's retirement? Pretty boring, not much adrenaline. Can you open the gate? -Enjoy! -Yes, thank you! Shit! Find him. He mustn't leave. He's gone? Damn it! How long ago? We missed our opportunity. -Where did he go? -I don't know. There's no need to freak out. Let's take a breather. I'll grab a bite to eat. Where do you want to go? I'd rather be alone, if you don't mind. I need to think. OK. See you at the office. -Bye. -Bye. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Did you get the video from the drone? What does it show? -Are you kidding me? -What about the drone? Nothing. There was nothing. The video is useless, and there's nothing proving your innocence. Be reasonable. Turn yourself in. Everyone thinks you've lost your mind. Even Sonia Perez thinks you've lost your mind over Carava. -Sonia said that? -Yes. You're really on your own. Can you look into Sonia Perez? Why? I have a bad feeling about her. She's holding out on us. -Hi, buddy. -Hi, Godfather. Mom's not here. She went out for a run. I know. I came to see you. Can you do me a favor? Yes. Look... do you recognize this man? Has he ever been here? -Him? -Yes, try to remember. Not here, but... -In Mali. -In Mali? -Where in Mali? -At the orphanage. I think he picked me up. It wasn't your mom? No. Mom was waiting for me at the door of the orphanage. I think it was him who took me to her. Did he have anything on his forearm? I don't remember. -Do you forgive me? -Of course, Malik. What are you drawing? American soldiers. We learned about them at school. Sonia Perez. At the age of 16, she was emancipated from her abusive parents. She lived with Leclerc. At 18, she joined the army. Never married, never in a civil union. She adopted Malik six months ago. What about her bank account? She made a big withdrawal, 10,000 euros, six months ago. That doesn't look good. Leclerc came to see me during my lunch break. What? He flinched when I told him Sonia Perez didn't support him. So you just relaxed together? I didn't take the risk to intervene. It was busy. You don't think he's innocent, do you? I don't know. He's a fugitive. Innocent people don't run. He's not on the run. He's hiding. It's not the same. Sonia! -What are you doing here? -I need to talk to you. Get in. Malik said Carava took him from the orphanage. Is it true? Everything was in order. We were going to get Malik, but there was an administrative problem. Alain said it'd be postponed for several weeks or even canceled. And that's when Carava showed up? Yes. We met in a bar. We recognized each other. He told me he was working for a French security company. We started talking. I was sad, and I told him everything: the sleazy orphanage, the request for adoption, the refusal. He told me he knew people in Mali, that if I had enough money, he'd bribe them. I knew it was illegal, but it was Malik. And you paid him? Three weeks later, I went back to Mali to get Malik. It was the best day of my life. Did Alain know about this? No. Carava told me not to say anything. Did it stop there? You didn't see him again? He didn't say anything about himself? I did see him again. A few weeks ago, the day before the mission against Oumar Kaïtané. He talked about what he had done for Malik, the risks he had taken. He asked me for a favor. He wanted information about the attack that was being prepared. Of course, I didn't tell him anything. He didn't insist. But the next day, I woke up and knew I had blacked out. I felt bad, sloppy, but it wasn't like a hangover. He drugged you to make you talk about Kaïtané's hideout. I understood when I saw the tattoo on the video. It's my fault Guillaume died. -You couldn't have known. -I should've. No, you were set up from the beginning. How? Carava didn't come to you by chance. He had to know your weak spot. He has an accomplice. I know it. I saw it. Did he ever talk to you about anyone? No. He told me that he'd made a deal to sue the army. But I don't know with whom. Get down! Sonia, answer me! -Take her into surgery. -Is she going to be OK? We'll let you know. -What's going on? -Sonia and I were shot at. -Where is she? -In the ER. In serious condition. OK. Don't move. Hello, Angoulême Station. Thank you very much, Marion. Thanks for calling me back, Doctor. OK. Thanks. Sonia's alive. She's coming out of a coma. Where are you going? To the courthouse. Why? Carava sued the army when he got fired. Soldiers testified on his behalf. If it was one of those bastards who shot at us, -I'll find his name. -Enough! They killed Guillaume and went after Sonia. What would you do if you found them? Kill them, too? -Let me pass. -I don't recognize you anymore, Paul. -Where is he? -Gone. Where? You know where. Mrs. Croze, help us find him. He's innocent. Carava tried to kill him. He just defended himself. If it's true, justice will be done. But first, I have to take him in. Talk to me. It's the right thing to do. Do you realize what you are asking of me? He's the father of my son. Are you afraid for him? You are? I can see it. -And you're right. -He's not himself anymore. Help him then. This could end badly. Tell me where he is. Would you like to make 50 euros? -Doing what? -Yelling at a cop. Sir. Empty your pockets. Empty my pockets? Are you crazy? Where do you think you are? I know my rights, OK? Fuck you! Sir! Stop! ARCHIVES It's him. Leclerc! Go that way! Don't move! I'll shoot if you move! I'll take my chances. Don't make me, Leclerc. Think about your godchild. If his mother doesn't make it, you'll be all he has left. Give me 24 hours. I know who's behind all this. I have to talk to him, then I'll turn myself in. You have my word. We looked everywhere. We can't find him. He's not far. Block off the area. COURT FILES -I don't believe this. -What? Carava's lawsuit, which he didn't win. -Well? -Look who his lawyer was. Alain Croze. Leclerc's childhood friend. He can't say he didn't know Carava. That's where he went. Oh, Paul! You scared me. What are you doing here? Everything OK? Wanna go to the shooting range again? With all the cops there, it's not a good idea. You put Sonia into the clutches of Carava. What? You knew about the operation against Kaïtané, and you knew it was my squadron which would provide the intelligence component. What are you talking about? You're delusional. You must've had a good laugh when I asked you to handle Malik's adoption. Admit it. There was never any concern about adoption. You pretended, so Carava would look like the savior. Paul, you're losing your mind. You need help. Stop your bullshit. Tell me. I'm your buddy. We've known each other forever, so stop this. You're not a killer. That's not like you. -Are you nuts? -Tell me! What happened at the courthouse with Leclerc? Nothing, why? You don't trust me. We're partners at work and in life. I could sacrifice myself for you, and you don't trust me. This isn't the time. It's the perfect time. Please calm down. I'm going to sit here and not move. All right? What do you want to know? Carava... did you know him or not? You were his lawyer against the army, right? -Yes, so? -So? I was a public defender, Paul. I saw him for three hours. How could I have guessed? What are you trying to say? I saw you at the courthouse. You let Leclerc get away. Why? Do you know him? No, I've never met him. Why are you helping him then? I don't know. He reminds me of my father. -Your father? -Yes. His loneliness, his determination, his weakness, too. Everything I didn't want to see when he was sick, after my brother's death. Shit, Paul... Snap out of it, dammit! I've known Guillaume since he was little. I'm married to his mother, and I've known you all my life. How could I be responsible for his death in any way? How could I look at myself in a mirror? You need to stop, Paul. You need to accept the death of your son, mourn him, stop this vendetta of yours. Tell me now. Why didn't you tell me about your father? You don't trust me? Of course I do. Whatever. You're wrong. I trust you more than I trust myself. I don't know. I don't want to promise you anything. I don't want to disappoint you. That's all. Is that why you don't want to commit? Do you want to punish yourself all your life? Don't you want to marry me instead? Maïwenn Castel, will you marry me? I'm living way beyond my means, Paul. I need to impress Marion. Do you think it's easy to fill your shoes? It's not, let me tell you. It's not easy. I need to make her dream, so she can finally move on. So yes, I do know Carava. I met him at the shooting range. He told me... about his life, what he does... We fantasized about Kaïtané's gold. -So you used us? -Of course not. Guillaume, Sonia, me. Carava was supposed to get the gold before you showed up. Don't move! Hands up! There. You're telling me that you didn't want Guillaume to die, that it wasn't the plan. I swear. Did you shoot at Sonia and I in the car? I couldn't go back. I had gone too far. You were going to discover everything. But you... Stop! Stop, Alain! I won't go to prison, you hear? -I won't go to prison! -What are you going to do? Kill us both? They'll say you went crazy and tried to kill us! I'm sorry, Marion. I'm sorry... Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon! Asshole, drop your weapon! There we go, there go. Now, slowly, slowly. Put it down... Put it down... Put it down! Marion, my love. My love, I'm sorry. Look at me. It's not my fault. Are you OK? -I'll take care of you. -Thanks. It's a good thing your wife is a doctor. -Ex-wife. -Yes. When your wife, ex-wife, has fixed you up, come to the station, OK? I need to take your statement. -What is it? -Alain's involuntary confession. My gift to you. You'd make a good cop. And you'd make a bad soldier. -Do I sign here? -Yes. -Yes. -Yes what? Your marriage proposal. Yes. They say it's an experience. -So don't say it's... -OK, fine. We'll experiment... We'll experiment. I'd like you to return to the unit. Your resignation letter... we'll forget about it. Everything's going to hell in the army, Colonel. Except for honor and esprit de corps. Honor and esprit de corps. I have new recruits in the squadron. We'll double in size in two years. We need an instructor. No one can match your experience. I thought you might be interested. It's sedentary. You won't go on missions. Don't answer right away. Thank you, Colonel! See you very soon, Commander. Are you OK? I came to check on your bandages. They're very happy that you came. I didn't come alone. -Hello. -Hello. Malik, have we ever played soccer together? Never! Pass it! Subtitling: Hiventy by TransPerfect
