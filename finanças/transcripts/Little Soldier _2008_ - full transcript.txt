Hey, it's Lotte! Isn't it Lotte who's come home? Did you manage to save the world, then? You don't recognize me? I'm Fischer. Shall I say hello to him? I'll say hello then. The UN Resolution gave us the right. I've done nothing wrong. The prime minister rejected criticism - - of Denmark's military role in Iraq. Yes? Peekaboo! Hi, dad. You've come home? Yes. How long have you been back? A couple of months. And your old dad had to hear it from Fischer? Been partying, maybe? You haven't got much of a tan. - Leave it. You came home early. - I'd had enough. I thought you'd signed up for years. I've quit smoking. Nice. Get dressed. Why? - You need a proper meal. Get dressed and we'll find somewhere to eat. Do as your old dad tells you! Do as you're told! Come on! When a real sailor goes ashore You never know what will happen All along the dockside The girls wave and say When a sailor A real sailor Goes ashore You never know what will happen If a girl is nice to him Maybe she'll get a kiss... Lotte! Let's have Lotte on stage! Lotte! Lotte, Lotte... When a sailor When a real sailor goes ashore You never know what will happen ... I'll tell you in a whisper When a sailor... A real sailor goes ashore You never know what will happen All along the dockside The girls wave and say When a sailor... Don't look so miserable. You're a good-looking girl. Haven't you got a boyfriend? I want to go home. - Get back in the saddle. Back in the saddle. Hop up! Come on! Come on! You're too heavy, baby. Baby? You're too heavy. Can you lend me some money? I'll give you a job. ... Get back in the saddle, baby. I am your dad and I'll give you a job. Baby? Lotte! Little soldier, you've got no money Lily? Lily? ... Almost 6 weeks. I'm pleased you got home in one piece... did I tell you that? - Home made. - She cooks, too? I made them. All she can do is moan and shake her booty. Well, as long as she's good at that... I used Splenda instead of sugar. It's just as good. For goodness sake... -They taste great. That job... There isn't a job, is there? - Of course. For my daughter. You can be the odd job girl. Drive me around. Stuff. - Drive you? - I'm banned. I'd had a couple and I ran into the back of a van on the bypass. - In the Jag? - No, the old wreck, luckily. Can't you take cabs and lend me some money? No. This is nice. The manual is in the glove compartment if you need it. There's a funny noise. Hear it? - Just. I miss driving. Badly. Fischer's got a grandchild. He's younger than me. Just thought I'd mention it. Hi, Kurt. Sit. You can start by putting these into a ring binder. In date order. Yes. I might need two ring binders. - Got to start somewhere. Hang these up. And then get us some lunch. What the hell is this? Hi, Lotte. I'll ask you again: What the hell is this? I fell down my steps last night. "Fell down my steps?" What use is that to me? I won't be able to drive for 6 weeks. - She needs a driver in an hour. I can drive her. - Like heck. The drivers are men. Don't you think I can handle it? She can, you know. 400 crowns a ride. And it's only for today. I'll find someone else. OK, ladies... And drive nicely. She really doesn't want to meet the cops, if you see what I mean. ... garbage and whether politicians are interested in recycling... Thanks. That funny noise gets worse once the engine warms up. One of the trucks got caught up in a bad crash in Milan. I keep feeling dizzy. And I can't find her a driver. Not one I can trust. I'll go on driving her. I am her driver. That's fine. Like hell. - I'm only helping. Till Fischer is all right. - Fischer is a fucking twat. I'm not sure your lady'll be too thrilled. It's none of her business. - No. I know you can handle it. So your old dad had a job for you after all, eh? Eh? Yes, he's just fantastic. You can go. I've got to wait for a fax from Milan. I'll call a cab. We'll go out for supper again soon. Right? Good to see you, Henning. Good to see you, Lily. A lady? Yes, come in. Thank you. Thank you, Henning. And now we wait. Would you like a cup of coffee? Fischer usually sits over there. I drink too much coffee. I'd like to cut down. I've never seen a lady driver. Lily and I leave the bedroom door open - - so you can always check that everything is all right. Yes? It's Lotte from next door. Yes? - I've locked myself out. I'll let you in. - Thanks. Hi. - Hi. Haven't you got a key to my flat? - I don't know. Miriam has just moved out. - Oh. Come in and we'll see if we can find it. It's nice to hear noise from your flat again. Yes. Was it hard? - Well... My mum would be very upset if I went there. What did your mum say? - Oh, she's dead. I didn't know. - She died ages ago. I was 11. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... That's all right. I grew up with my granny and granddad. What about your dad? - He runs a haulage company. Hey! Is this it? - Yes. Thanks. Wait a moment... For you. It's a geranium. They usually die on me. I'm not very... It just needs watering now and then. If you forget, don't worry. It'll survive. Thanks. What are we doing? - Trading. Trading? I'm trading girls with some geezers from Sweden. We rotate them. How many girls are you running? I'm doing them a favour. Nigeria is a fucking dump. I help them. I've done nothing wrong. Why are you so miserable? - I'm driving. Yes, like a twat. Cheeky bastard. That's my daughter. You could use these. Very fine stuff. Have a look. They're great. A present. - Thanks. I'll take them. Give over. We're friends. A present from one friend to another. See you next time. Hello, Lotte. - Hello, Fischer. Hi Lotte! Hi. Nice car. - My dad's. What are you doing here? What are you? - I work at a school here. Trying to knock knowledge into impossible kids. What are you doing? - Finding something to eat. Do you like Thai? Shall I cook you a Thai meal tonight? Seven o'clock? - Eight. I must be getting on. - See you at eight. Business isn't too great, is it? Look what I'm wearing... Cute as hell. Look what I found at home. Look! From your confirmation. You looked sweet in that dress. - Look at those shoes! Look! It was a real occasion. - Not that you were there. I was! - Come on! I begged granny for years to let you come, and then you didn't. I took the pictures! - Christian took the pictures. I gave you a Walkman. - Yes. You sent it in the post and I sent you those pictures. A good thing I've got charm. I'm taking Lily out for dinner. You, too. Not tonight. - Why not? They are having a party. - They'll have to wait. Come on. I want my money back! Now! She's useless. - Cool it. Now! - He is crazy, I do nice. Shut it. I want my money back. Now. - Hey, calm down. Shut it, you ugly tart. Don't call me a tart. Tart. His jacket... And don't come back, pal. Right. Right? Did you like it? I'm sorry. I... I had to help my dad and... I lost track. I just wanted to make sure you were all right. Are you? Would you... like some coffee? Maybe it's a bad moment? I'll come for coffee another day. I'm busy, actually. Oh, OK. It's me. The telephone lady says there isn't much to do today. I need to go out tonight. Pick me up at 7. At the workshops. Hasn't that noise got worse? Or maybe it hasn't. Where the hell did you get to? What are we talking about? - I had a fight with a punter. You're hard. Really hard. I'm sorry. Your dad is an old fool. I froze up. Let's say no more about it. I am a haulier. I'm old. Yes. Forward march, bim, bam, boom. Wankers. Don't Albanians learn to tell the time? Maybe there's a time difference. This is Pearl. Maria. Hot chick. Very popular in Sweden. - What the hell is this? - No problem. No problem? Who's going to buy her? You can't punish your birds like that. - It is bad for business. - Make-up, she'll be fine. I see a sexy, hot body. Send me another one. I can't use her. We're out of here. They're out of their tiny minds. Nobody'll buy a tart who looks like a motorway pile-up. Ouch... What's up? It's gone now. Just get me home. My keys... - I'll get them. Come on... Let's get that jacket off. Lotte... take your jacket off. Help! You really are... - Kiss me. No, I can't do that. - Kiss me! No, thanks. Go on! - Off with your jacket... Go on... - No. No, no. You need to go to bed. With you. - No, not with me. No... no, Lotte. You need some sleep. And you need a school ma'am with her hair in a bun... ... who enjoys watering her house plants and supper at six. Exactly. Lie down. And after that you'll hold hands and watch telly. Now your quilt... No, Lotte. Please stay with me. And kiss me. No, Lotte. No. No. Good night. Lotte, lie down. Lie down. Go to sleep. Beat it or I'll chop it off. Hey? My sister's inside and needs help. Open the door for me. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me. You are so lovely. So lovely. Your skin is so lovely. No, no, I'm sorry. I am so tired. Please let me sleep. I can't sleep. Yes, you can sleep now. I love you. Come on. Is it too much for you? Shall I get another driver? What do you mean? What lousy customers, eh? Shall I find another driver? I'm doing fine, don't you think? - You're doing a fantastic job. Daddy's little toughie. We'll go out for a good meal. - I'm not hungry. Something nice. Bananas. Bananas. Lotte... 23 24 48. What? - The code. You are my daughter. I want you to have the money. I am proud of you. We've got to get those ships off. Off... We... Where is Lily? On her way. What is it? What? They say it isn't serious. Just my insulin again. I'm always getting it wrong. And there's the stress. And too much booze. And I forget to eat. You just need a holiday. You told me stuff... Just a load of nonsense. I don't remember a thing. I just collapsed. Peekaboo! - Are you all right? You've gone full-time, then? - She was in a mess. She didn't want to be alone. - No? No. You can drive me to work, then. - What about your head? Blah, blah, blah. I've got two artics to get off to Madrid today. We'll leave in five minutes. That noise is getting worse. - We'll send her to the garage. The sailor knows That there are sweet girlish hearts Beating in every port As soon as he's there When a sailor When a real sailor steps ashore Sure you wouldn't like coffee? - I'd rather not. I need mine. I could make tea? You can have your money back. Lily? Lily? Come on! My nose! Nice of you to drop by. - I thought you'd like your car back. Henning's been using my girls since I started, and always behaved himself. You slapped me? - There's more where that came from. And she's off to Sweden on Friday. So you can beat it. Sweden? Beat it, I said. You're giving her to the Swedes? - She wants to make money. But you don't get that. You're too spoilt. He isn't here. He took a taxi home. I don't know if he'll be back. I'll go, then. Yes. See you, Fischer. - Yes. Hi, baby. You've been into my piggy bank. You said it was for me. Come with me. You gave Lily all the money? - She's going home. I doubt it. They never go back to the pig sty. They make too much here. She's going home. She'll get off in Rome. Or London. Or wherever. And set herself up as a madam. Now she can buy her own girls. She's going home. You still think you can save the world, don't you? I wouldn't know. You need a lesson. A beating never did anyone any harm. In that case you'll have to give it to me. I won't hit back, don't be scared. What do you reckon, John? Don't you agree? A dad gives his own beatings. Give him the bat, John. I won't hurt him. Give him the bat! Go on. You can do it. Go on! We'll run you home. And say no more about it. We're hard, you and me. Tough guys. Little soldier. Baby? Lotte? English subtitles Jonathan Sydenham
