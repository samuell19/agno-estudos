# Well, he feels like an elephant # Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it # He knows that you're dreaming about being loved by him # Too bad your chances are slim... Hey, hey. What? Yeah, where is she? You ready? It's almost too beautiful, darling. - Mia! It's time to go, Mum. Our human spirits are not theirs to control. - They can't do anything. - They can arrest us... again. Heath, you're free. Don't ever forget that, darling. I won't. # What would they say if I ruled the world? # Blackheath someday # Oh, I've lost my mind too many times # Going to catch you for sure # Cradle snatcher no more... # Toothless bastard I saw # Final chances no more # Now I find when I've told you not to go... Silver or gold? - I think gold. # Peace of mind is mine So let it go # Oh... If she does this sort of thing again, we're gonna have to charge her, OK? Yeah, sorry. Thank you, officer. # I've been trying # Yeah, I am dying # Since I've been spying # Oh # She's beautiful. Oh. Thank you, Mum. OK, lunch is in the fridge and I'll call you on my break. - Yes. Mr. Parks? You look chilly. - You look so rough. - Oh, thank you. Robbie couldn't do it last night. Again. All I did was take a picture. He's being ridiculous. - Look. You'd have taken a picture too, right? - Um... - Anyone would have. I sent it to, like, two people. He flips. I'm, like, "What's the big deal?" Nat, we have to go to the Isle of Sounds festival. - Tonight. I can't. I've got Robbie's nanny's funeral tomorrow. - Hello, dears. - Mrs. Cousins. Hello, hello, hello. - Whoo! - Whoo! Wait. Hang on. Have a look at that. Look, look, look. Well, let's hope he's a grower. Oh, my God. Oh, balls! - Robbie dumped me. I'll pick you up some new ribbon on the way home from work. Don't forget. - I said I would. - Not the yellow one. - OK. - Oh, here they are. Brilliant. Perfect. Darling... We'll talk about that in a minute. I've gotta do my employer's report. What shall I tell 'em? That I'm honest, hardworking and reliable? - No. - With my mum. Not with Mia? 'Cause she's up to something. And when she is, you're usually not far away. Well, not anymore. Not since... You can't afford to make any more mistakes, can you, boy? No. Oi. - For your mother. - Thank you. - Ah, shit! - Oops. - I'm not going. Don't be silly. Of course you're going. Uni can wait. Listen. You'll wanna hear this. - No, it's not possible. - Believe. - No, I own every demo. - It's no demo. It's new material. - Yeah. But it's enough to know it's definitely Kurtz. - No, Kurtz is dead. - You're wrong. Look. Boom. It's him. My only friend, Kurtz is playing the Isle of Sounds festival and we're going. Whoo! Whoo, ooh, ooh. So, Kurtz, a recluse for 12 years, is gonna make his grand reappearance at a music festival, a place famously full of people? Yes, exactly that. And if Kurtz can face the crowds, you can too. - We're going. - But I'm on probation. If I don't turn up to work on Saturday, Mack'll literally have me thrown in prison. What, are we scared of Mad Mack now, are we? OK, right, we're a little bit scared, but what's he gonna do? Send you down for having a panic attack at a gig? Anyway, I heard your unfriendly girlfriend's going, so... Mia's not my girlfriend. Come on, she lost her mum. - She's allowed to be a bit... - You only had to ask. You gonna tell me what happened last night? - The police were round again. - Leave it! - You leave it! God, your mum would be so disappointed. Well, she's not here, is she? Anywhere. Seeing as you took down all the photographs of her. You do not leave this room. Listen, mate, I'm going soon and I just want you to know that you don't have to live your life like this. Like what? Things don't have to be this bad for you. - They're not that bad. - Well, yeah, I know. I can think of worse existences. If only you would play. That's... I want you to play. You're a good musician. - Just... Dude, I'm just... I only want the best for you, man. You might die if you don't play. - I'm just... - Shut up! Is it me or is everyone in here a bit more yellow than yesterday? Will we have the pleasure of hearing you play tonight? - Um, yes. But what deal are you offering my artist? I'm offering your artist three minutes on that stage without being fired. - Take the deal. - No, I'm fine. You will be fine once you burn the house down. Now, listen, I've modified the signal path so you won't get that slight... - Yeah, the screeching. - Yes. It's just a lot more reliable. Go, Heath! Whoo! - Oh. - Just let it out. Jackpot! Yes! Yes. Play something. Seafood medley. It's OK. It's progression, right? Why don't you play something for us, Mia? If no one else will. # When the night comes # And you lay your weary head to rest # No more trials # No tests # When the night comes # And you lay by the one you love # The one that knows you and the things you do # When the night comes # Don't be afraid # You're only dreaming # At least you don't have to follow that, mate. - Yeah. Alright? Hello, Mack. - Mia. Boy, my house, now. Why is he here? I noticed that your old drum kit next door is... What are you reading at the moment, Heath? Nausea. - By Sartre. - Yeah. Unconvincing to say the least. That's because you don't understand it. Because we should accept responsibility for our own actions. - Mmm. As you know, it's a little over a week before you go back to school. Actually, only one of us is going back to school. The other just stopped going. Mia, for the rest of the holiday, when you're at home, you're with me. If you want to go somewhere, you go with the boy. Understood? - No. - Not really. - Konichiwa, compadres! Now is not a good time, Natalie. They're from my little sister's birthday party. I thought they'd brighten up Mia's room. How thoughtful. No, Mia. Mia, we haven't... Well, thank you for a lovely evening, Mr. Parks, but I think I should probably go. So I should stay? Please ask them to come back down. Right. - Yeah, all sparkly. - Nat, lose the straighteners. Do you have any idea what the sea air will do to my hair? I've got a fringe! It doesn't make sense. Your top, your top, your top, your top, your top. - ...fingers. - Shh! Your dad said that... Look out the front. Beyond the drive. I have seen her naked, and we're having a big threesome, so I'd like to get back to that now. What How big are her boobs? Does she have perfectly circular areola as if Da Vinci had drawn her himself? - I haven't seen her naked. - OK, listen, I've got my bike. - We ride tonight. - Not a chance. Wait. Are they nicking your bike? OK, pick me up out the front. (# Siouxsie and the Banshees: Hong Kong Garden) - We're just going to the... What's going on? Leon! - Mia! - Don't worry, Mr. Parks. - We'll get them back. - Helmet. - Whoo-hoo! Don't lean. - We've got company. I've always wanted to say that. Pull over! We're going to the Isle of Sounds! - Nat! - That's where we're going. No, you are going home. Oh, my God, they're coming. Go, go, go. We have you surrounded. He'll move. No, don't worry, they're not going far. Uh... - Come on! - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, leave the bike alone. OK, right. OK, for next time, the reserve tank, OK? - Stupid... Uh, it's your dad. If you wanna talk to him, you can talk to him. Mum? Yeah, no, no, no, I'm fine. - That you've run away with Mia. No. We are looking for her. Well, did you find her? Eat your fear. Eat it. Eat it. No. I think I might know where she's heading. Yes! Destiny is coming for you, my boy. You know, try not to worry and just get some sleep. Come on, then, get on. - Don't cry. - I'm not crying. (# Hyde & Beast: Pictures In The Sky) Don't get any ideas. What do you think of my chopper? My hairdryer's more powerful. Do you really have tickets? Oh, yeah. Big time. # With my boots on my feet and my hat in my hand # I started out to travel across this land # And the stars were my charts # The birds were my rock and roll band # The roads, they weren't long # And my heart felt a new sweet song # The trees and the sun just helped my love along # Aaaah! It's around here... It's around here somewhere. - Definitely. - Oh. Oh. - Definitely around here. - Oh, oh, oh... This is so exciting. Uh... we don't have a tent. Yeah, 'cause we're staying in a hotel, right? - Babe... - I'm sure you can use Leon's. Let there be light. Where are you? Oh, I've found you. He gets excited by the flora and the fauna, but really he's harmless. Guys, psst! Come over here. What I'm about to show you is one of the most important monuments in ancient history. Ta-da! What is it? - A sacrificial table. For... Neolithic virgins. For neo Yeah, well, I mean, people were significantly smaller back then. I think it's really impressive, mate. Thanks. It's alright. God, do you realize people used to live like this? They didn't really live like this because there weren't tents. But they did have stone structures much like our own houses, so... Civilization's going backwards. Well, it's not really going backwards, 'cause, you know, nowadays you have things like synthesizers. I was just, um, having a stretch after the ride. Let me listen. No, you're alright. - You probably wouldn't know it. - No, it's not me. - This is Kurtz. - Yep. - He's pretty weird. - Yep. Makes sense, I guess. Thank you. - It's cool. You don't have to like his music. I'm just not into guitars. You're not into guitars? No, not really. Wow, well, that's new. Then what are you into? Mmm... Industrial hardcore drum and bass. Right. Want some? Mmm. - Warm pear cider. - That's my favorite. - That makes sense, then. You alright? Yeah, actually. I just went to get petrol. Don't you ever sleep? Tea?

Leon! Oh. I hit a bunny rabbit. You killed him. Brother, we commend your molecules to the atmosphere. Maybe he was trying to send us a message. He's not sending anything. He's dead. Hello, Mum? Don't "mum" me. What do you want? Well, I just wanted to see if you're OK. At least tell me where you're going, darling. I'm worried. We're going to a festival for the weekend. How lovely. Have a wonderful time. - Make sure you call me later. Yeah, she's just not good on her own. - Isle of Sounds. - Could be. (# Kungs vs Cookin' on 3 Burners: This Girl) Hey!

Bon voyage. - Find some better clothes. Come on, I remember you. 50,000 people? At least. But I'll be here for you, buddy. Thanks, mate. That's genuinely made me feel a lot better. Oi, Leon. Can you, like, move, please? Don't move, mate. - Cute. - Oh, my God. No, I look good. - You look good. - I look good. - He looks good. Look at that. Yum. Go and give him your number. - He doesn't want my number. - Yeah, he does. He wants to send you a dick pic. I wanna dip him in yogurt. We go with him willingly. We're not his prisoners. What's her name? Mack. Have you even seen the way Mia looks at you, mate? What, like hair blocking the shower? It doesn't matter. This is gonna be good. I feel good. I feel good about this. - Oh, great. - You should dress like that. - He's smoking an e-cigarette. - Yeah. It's cool. It's not cool. It looks like he's chewing a pen. No, he's chewing electricity. Hi, I'm Leon, artist management. This is Heath, my... Boyfriend. - No, no, no. He's... He's my... - It's cool, man. Yeah, yeah, I know it's cool, 'cause... 21st century, innit? Um, so, Xavier's band is playing at the festival. - Yeah, so's Heath. That's a lie. - Yeah. We're an old-school guitar band, a dying breed. OK, I'm not, by the way. I... I've just come here to see someone play. Kurtz. - Yeah. Some hoax has got all the obsessives in a frenzy. No one actually thinks he'll show. Yeah, no, I know he won't show and that's what I've been telling you. But I'm not one of those... I'm not one of those fans. They're a bit... They're absolutely... Well, I love my fans. Well, I'm sure they appreciate that. Right. We gotta go. We'll hook up later, though, right? Call me. Yeah, definitely. I'm not playing here. Why did you lie? See, there is a fine line between a lie and mythology. Do you need to go and relieve yourself? Yeah, a little bit, but will you promise you'll stay here? No. You know, you could even have fun. I am having fun. - Just relax. - I am relaxed. I'm relaxed. Yeah, you look it. What do you mean, you don't have tickets? You said you had tickets! Loads and loads and loads of tickets! If I didn't, we wouldn't be here. Exactly. We would be in there and not here with you. Who are you calling? Who's she calling? Xavier. Hi. It's Mia. Oh, my God. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, no. There's nothing for you. - Brilliant. - Um... No VIP at least. Here you go. - Nothing wrong with that. Yes, you are punters and we are with the band. - With the band. Yeah. Thought you didn't like guitars. Depends who's playing. Mia, hey, let's go! Let's do this, Heath. Oh! Guys, if we get lost, can we just meet back at this tree or something? - Yeah, no, definitely. - OK, cool. Eat your fears. Eat your fears. Relax. - Relax, Heath. - Come on. - I left Mack in the car. - Well, it's too late. - But he'll overheat. - It's a bloody fairy.

It's gonna be so good. Can we please find Xavier, like, as soon as possible? Yeah, definitely. - Leon, get out! - Leon! Please. I will chop off your penis! She will. With a machete. What are you doing? Ah. You beauty. This is illegal and immoral. - But it's terribly exciting. - Yeah. Go and cast off. - Yeah. I worked on fishing boats for ten years. - Ooh. I'm gonna kill those kids when I find 'em. I wonder what we'll look like when we're older. We'll look like our mums, won't we? Oh, my God. Do not say that to me. We will. It's in our genes. My mum always said that I had fabulous genes. And then she got cancer and died. Still, fabulous genes, eh? Leon already looks just like his dad. Handsome man. Well, here's to all our wonderful parents. May we end up just like them. Here. - No, thank you. - I live clean. La pura vida. Trust me, he really doesn't need it.

You had the shirts and all that hair and... Your Suzie and I were always the last ones up at sunrise. Apart from you. Somebody had to keep an eye on you both. She loved this festival. If she were here, she'd be more upset with Mia than I am. - She played here. - She's not playing here now! Is she? Oh, shit. Good God, no wonder your boy's unstable. How dare you. Put your hands against the fence and spread your legs. Come on! You know, I sympathize. Heaven knows, I wouldn't want my daughter in there with all those rampant young men. But ask yourself, are you here for her... or for you? Hey, it's Mia. Leave a message, but don't expect a call back. Right, hi, it's Heath. Um... I really need to talk to you, so do call me back. It's important. OK. Oh, God. - Hello. - Ooh, I'm sorry. I didn't... - Sorry. I didn't... That's alright. Don't be silly. You look lost. - I'm just... - It's OK to be a little lost. Where are you going? I'm sorry. - Shit. Yeah, hello? - Hey. So I just wanted to give you a call and say we're fine... OK, Mia... We're backstage. - Yeah. Could you shout where you are, please? I'm by the buses. Don't come and find me. Just stay where you are. I'll come find you. Thanks. Mia! Mia! Mia! What? Where are you? Lying down. I can see buses and people. Hey. I just called you. Yeah. And I told you not to come. Right. Yeah, of course you did. Turns out it's actually quite easy to get backstage. You don't have to be from a old-school guitar band to get into this... car park. I broke in. It's not a big deal. What are you doing here again? I came for you. You did? You know I know things about you, right? I know things other people don't know. I know things that you don't know. What things? Special things. Just to warn you, I have been sick. Yeah, I... It's OK. You're so kind. I just... Ooh. - Really bad ones. Right. OK. I can... That's my bus. Oh. They have beds. Bedtime. Come on. Come on. - Yeah, I'm fine. - OK. - Excuse me. - I'll do that myself. - OK. Come on. Oh, I meant to tell you, your dad's here. Mm. Yeah, yeah, Scandi man. Who sent you? He's here? He's more here than you or I will ever be. Did they send you? Who? The puppeteers. The specters who feed off the creations of others. The ones who will never truly understand the mystery and the horror of what we do. We make sense of the chaos, bring order and balance to where there is none, knowing that when the final note dies, we all die. Because even the artist is powerless. Did the label send you? No one sent me. Wait. So? Um... - It's nice to meet you. - Gordon, get him out of here. No, no, no, no. Wait. Um... Why haven't you played for 12 years? - Don't touch that. - Everyone said you were dead. - Hoped. Your music has helped me through some really dark times. You're a child. You know nothing of dark times. Actually, last year, my mum, she tried to... Stop. Well, thank you. That's all I really wanted to say. So I'll go now. How did you find me? I heard the rumors. And the new stuff. Stuff? Material? And? - Well, I, you know, I... - Hated it. No. No, no, no. No. You dare to break in here and pass judgment on me? On my work? You don't deserve my work. Why should I share it with you, or anyone? Who are you? You're nobody! Mmm. That was so impressive. Sometimes I think life gives me so much sweetness that there's nothing left for Heath. Who is this Heath? My whole life he's done so much for me. He's the reason I'm here now. But last night I lost him. - I'm not a good friend. - Aw. I have to find a way for him to play. It's the only way to make it right. But how, mi amor? I don't know. I don't know. But I will find him and he will play. - And I will help you. Yeah. Ooh! Hello, Michael. These lovely people have offered to help us. It's OK. Doesn't he ever sleep? I wanna sleep. Can you really get him on that stage? This is a festival, baby. We can do anything. But first you've gotta do something for me. Anything, mi amor. You're gonna love it. So, Heath... If you like him, you might have to give him a bit more of a clue. Why? So that he knows you like him. I don't like him. You don't like anyone. I like you. You're stinky. - This is where we part company. - You're not going anywhere. You're so pretty. Look at your flowers. I just need to find my daughter! Mia? I've met her. - You'll find her soon enough. Stay a while. Bollocks.

I saw him, though, last night. - After I put you to bed. I think I'm the reason he didn't show. Yeah, alright, course you are. Yo, man, you're crazy. I love you. You're great. - Whoo-hoo! Mia, can you just come down? What, and join the only person not having any fun? No. Heath, destroyer of the vibe, man. Your dad's here. He's gonna see you on the screens. - Put me down, please. - I didn't call him. Of course you did. That is your signature move, that is. Ever since we were nine years old, you've followed me everywhere. Bullshit. You begged me to play in your terrible band. Yeah, and when was the last time anyone heard you play? Have you ever asked yourself why it is you do everything everyone else asks you to do but never what you actually wanna do, huh? What are you so afraid of? - You're just like him. - No, I'm not. So you're not at all locked up, pissed off at the world or stubborn? But I know things about you as well, and this isn't you. Well, my dad can't find me as long as I'm not with you.

And by the artist, you mean you? And two... 12 years. It's a long time. There are thousands of people. Waiting to see you. You have to go back. Their eyes full of hope and expectation. I can't. They just want to hear you play. To hear your new material. You want music, you play your own. Nobody wants to hear me play. There it is. Ego and doubt go to battle. We'll make an artist of you yet. It's just a gig. It's never just a gig, mate, never. (# Justin Vernon & Aaron Dessner: Big Red Machine) # We're safe Our love went dormant # We read my mind # So many times... Trust me. Close your eyes. # The earth is only sand # Fucked up and puked up in dismay # Resolve... Open your eyes. It really hurts. - Yes. I miss you, Suzie. I miss you. - Hey. Mia, where are you? They're about to go on. Xavier's going mad 'cause you're not here. Come now! Mia? Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Mum? - Mighty sun... - Mum! Bring me the power, shine within me... and let me do this alone. What are you doing here? Mum. You came. Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. You weren't a beautiful baby. But from your very first breath, you were a beautiful soul. You are. I shouldn't have left you. Yes, you should. You're free. You haven't always been. But you can't look after me forever. OK, there's something I really have to do. Do you wanna come with me? You go. I'll be right behind you. - Go on. I'm playing tonight. It's gonna be terrible. Oh, babe. Come on, kitten. # Wanting # Your mind to change # Hoping # Your faith remains # Believing # We're strong enough # Go on and shake it off # Don't turn away another day # I've got a feeling it's alright # Let's start the fire Let's start the day # Let's start to win And let's start again # Let's start again # Let's start again # Let's start again # We go round and round in search of something new # I've wasted so much time denying every truth... Can I use your phone? Uh, yeah. Mia, listen, it's Leon. I've gotta find Heath. - Yeah. Yeah, it's me. - Heath, you didn't leave. Listen, you have to play tonight. You have to. - OK. - Yeah, no, I said OK. Where are you? You're gonna miss your slot. - Yeah, I'm by the... The stars. What, like the big dipper? How am I gonna find you? If you put your bloody sunglasses, flippy things up, then you'll find me, won't you? I'll find you, man. It doesn't matter. This is it, brother. We're gonna do this. You on that sacred stage. Just you and your guitar... Cheers. Thanks. Um... Thank you for bringing me here. Yeah, well, the way I remember it, you stole my bike and I was just trying to get it back. Sorry. For everything. So your mum really played here? Yeah. Very first one. You know, I really thought that she could be here. In some way. It was stupid. No, it's not. And, anyway, you know who is here, eh? I know. I saw him. I think he's high. - Sounds absolutely terrifying. - Mm. - I hope he's alright. - You could try asking him. He wasn't always such a psycho. He only stopped acting like a normal human being when my mum died. Parents are mental. They are. Everyone knows that. But at some point you've gotta talk to them, 'cause you definitely can't outrun them, can you? Whoa. - She's really beautiful. - So's he. Look at him. Look at those leggings. Hey, guys. This is Aisha. - Hi. - Listen, I am so excited. - Well, that makes one of us. - Yeah, apparently so. - Yeah, you are. It's OK if you're rubbish, as long as you play. Thanks. - Hello. Shut the front door. - You look incredible. Thank you, Natalie. Hey, guys, we congregate here, as the ancients did... No, how are you still doing that? Right, listen, let's just go. Come on. Well, come on. (# Future Islands: Seasons ) Yes! Oh! # Seasons change # And I tried hard just to soften you # And seasons change # But I've grown tired of trying to change for you # 'Cause I've been waiting on you... So the story goes... That this is where Kurtz played his first gig, yeah. Yeah. # 'Cause I've been waiting on you # Ooh, ooh, ooh... Ta-da! Well, it's certainly got character, hasn't it? Yeah, but there's no one here. Oh, that's not strictly true. There's a zombie over there. YOLO, brother. Alright, look at me. Look at me. Do I have to? No, you can look where you want, but, listen, you're gonna kill it, mate, right? - And I'm gonna introduce you. - No, you don't have to... - Yes. Right, what we're here for is a world premiere. A performance by someone who's very special to me... and after this will be very special to you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Wait. Name? - It's a bit shit. - Brilliant. - OK. Heath! Heath, everyone! Give it up. Yeah, whoo. Go, Heath. Team Heath. Fuck. Fuck, fuck. Sorry. Can I... Give me a minute, please. OK, OK, everyone, you heard the man. Out. - Vamoosh. - I'll vamoosh you in a minute. - Au revoir. Just... Just give me some... When your mum played here... she was stunning. I don't wanna forget her voice. When we get home, we'll listen to every recording she ever made. Alright. I'd like that. But any time you wanna hear your mum's voice, all you've gotta do is sing. When an artist hits the wall, he has to push his head through it, and if he doesn't... he wakes up 12 years later surrounded by a wall he's built himself that's too high and too thick to break. And there is no new material. If you've got something, let's hear it. Play it. Play it. Look, Dad, come here. # It's such a pleasure to touch your skin # To touch your skin # It's such a pleasure to touch your heart # To touch your heart... I'm playing synth. I'm playing synth. Did you write this? # A gentle love A gentle love # A gentle heart A gentle heart # A gentle love A gentle love # A gentle heart A gentle heart # All the things that cause you trouble, cause pain # Such a pleasure to touch your skin # To touch your skin # It's such a pleasure to touch your heart # And I can hardly wait # I will wait till you arrive # To make it to the grave # And I couldn't have done anything else # I couldn't have done anything else # A gentle love A gentle love # A gentle love A gentle love # A gentle love A gentle love # A gentle love A gentle love # A gentle love A gentle love # Thanks. Yo, next year you'll be headlining. If you set it up. When am I gonna see you again, bro? Soon. - Go with the wind, darling. Hey. Oh, hey. So, um, you're heading off, then? Yeah, that's right. I got you something. - Yeah. Shut your eyes. Shh. Whaa! # Ask me what I did with my life # I spent it with you # If I lose my fame and fortune # Really don't matter # As long as I got you, baby # Ask me what I did with my life # I spent it with you # If I lose my fame and fortune # Really don't matter # As long as I got you, baby # Clap your hands Drop so right # Clap your hands, drop so right # Clap your hands Drop so right # As long as I got you, baby # Clap your hands Drop so right # Clap your hands, drop so right # Clap your hands Drop so right # As long as I got you #
