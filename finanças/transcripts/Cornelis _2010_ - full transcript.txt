At the place where I do this song once an evening... ...this gap between the second to last and last verse- -Is where I usually have to tell a dirty joke. To keep the audience's interest up. But this audience is of such a high standard that I don't have to do this. Otherwise I've got lots up my sleeve... I'll go straight to the last verse. I hope you realise that in no way is this an autobiographical song... I have the pleasure of possessing the most respectable parents... And this song came about more or less like... ...the other side of the coin, so to speak. It's a portrait of a guy you see around and about... So it's not me. Cornelis! Cornelis! Military police! Open up! - Derek Jansen. Is he here? - No. - No? So where is he? - I don't know. You don't know? - You, my little fellow. Do you know? - He's sick. - Sick? - Yes. Tuberculosis. Then maybe we will have to... take him to the hospital? What do you say, boy? Would you like to come with us? Please don't take him with you. I need him here with me. - We both know I have to take someone. - He's not here! - It's great you visit me like this. - Don't mention it. - Good night. - Good night. - Ingalill. - Cornelis. - ...so he's quite busy. - But I thought Santa was! - So what is it you write? - Just a little doggerel. Well, this is me... Fancy coming in for a nightcap? It'd completely forgotten that I'm due at my brother's for dinner. I'm really sorry, but I have to go. We only meet once a year. Can't you help me with my zip? Thanks! I really must go... No, stay! Sit down and drink up in peace and quiet. - I can go... - No, just make sure you shut the door. - Bye. - Bye. Morning. - ...beautiful psychiatric nurse! - In the whole of Beckomberga asylum! The prettiest girl in the asylum! You're gorgeous! No, really you are! So can I hear it? Go on. Let me hear it! "My love is like a Roman candle" "Like a Roman candle, quick to flare" "Burning bright and hot to handle" "My love is like a Roman candle" "Like a Roman candle, quick to flare." Will you marry me? Maybe not right now, but one day... Well, quite soon... - Easy now... - No, no, no! - I'm not doing it. I refuse. - On what grounds? I believe that an attempt was made on my life. - The tie is part of your uniform. - So etiquette goes before safety? It doesn't matter if the staff die as long as they're wearing ties. If we cannot agree, I must ask you, Mr Vreeswijk, to hand in your notice. That will be a pleasure. You may leave your shirt and trousers with the caretaker. Is that singer Fred Åkerström? Yes! Don't you want me to introduce you? - No... - Come on! - What's he doing here? - I guess he knows someone. See you later... I hate fancy dress parties. - What have you come as? - A psychiatric nurse. And you? Can't you tell? A folk singer. I've heard you play. I just want to say I think you're fucking good. Fucking good. I play a bit of guitar myself. Is that so? Here you go, brother. Gather round, everyone. Time for a little music. Off you go. Go ahead. I can play... I'll have to... ...play a song about... ...minorities. Killer-Anders, that's me, that's me Killer-Anders, that's me, that's me Killer-Anders that's me I'm getting beheaded at three For it's the law of Sweden, I'll be damned. I've murdered four men, four men I've murdered four men, four men I've murdered four men and if they ain't in heaven I'll be meeting them again, I'll be damned. There's the axeman in his hood so red There's the axeman in his hood so red With his sword and hood so red he'll make sure that I am dead It's how he earns his daily bread, I'll be damned. All you waiting for my shriek for my shriek All you waiting for my shriek for my shriek All you waiting for my shriek will get to see a corpse so chic 'cos I'm just a publicity freak I'll be damned. This is my farewell verse, farewell verse This is my farewell verse, farewell verse This is my farewell verse now I'll soon be in a hearse Well I guess things could be worse, I'll be damned! Right on! That was good! Really, really good. Listen and learn! - Incredible. - So you're going to be an author? - That's an ambition, you could say. But first you want to be a journalist. - The rent won't pay itself. - You write damn good songs anyway. - Listen. Damn good songs. - Thanks. You don't fancy selling some? They're hassling me for a new record... and I have to find something new. You'd record my songs? You see, I reckon they'd suit me down to the bloody ground. That'd be... - ...fucking ace. - Ace? Fucking ace! Cheers. - Who was that you were talking to? - Who? The guy with the hair, who was drooling all over you. You didn't seem that uninterested yourself. - I just thought he was nice. - Well that much was obvious. She was also very nice. So what were you talking about? This and that... Well, what? What? I don't know. You were standing there for hours. You must remember something! Jesus Christ, what... Is it my child? Is it? Is it? Is it my child or have you been with someone else? You're sick. Ingalill, I... Sorry! Ingalill, I'm sorry! Sorry... Shit. It's time. - Really? Now? - We have to call a taxi. Good. Shall I call a taxi? OK, then let's do it. Come on. Get my bag... Sorry, sorry... I almost didn't make it out of bed. No problem. - Shouldn't we grab a coffee first? - Nah, come on. Let's go in, it'll be cool. Come on. Hi! Mona's not here today, but we can offer you some Vichy water at least. - Come in! - Thanks. I'm actually off to the countryside, so I've only got a few minutes. I've promised to do saddle of veal with quince jelly and roast potatoes. I didn't dare leave it in the car in case it got stolen. The car, I mean, not... So you're Fred's new composer. Cornelis...? Vreeswijk. Anders Burman, producer here at Metronome. He's got all the material for our new record. But it's not been written down or recorded, right? No, it's all in my head. If it doesn't stick there, it won't stick anywhere! - So could you play something for us? - OK. Er, I prefer to sit. "Ballad on a garbage dump." I'm sitting in a garbage dump feeling kind of rough With the rags and empty bottles and other kinds of stuff A tear rolls down my cheek I'm filled with sad regret For it gets better by the day but good it'll never get For it gets better by the day but good it'll never get. Time's well out of joint, I tell you all good folk You run in circles chasing status what a bloody joke. Well that's like soap slippery when wet For it gets better by the day but good it'll never get For it gets better by the day but good it'll never get. - But what do you want to do? - I just want to play music. Sure, but when you're in bed at night... Don't you have a dream? A dream? Just going around playing music. Doing gigs. Because I'm deeply impressed, you see. Terribly impressed. I've never heard such a debut. A born star. "Sold out"? They can't be serious. Congratulations! ...a great big room, were all the city heads They then wrote out an envelope And stood as one and said: "There are no soldiers left today..." Siw, that was great! Great! - Pablo Neruda. - Pablo Neruda. Cheers everyone! ...preferred C major to G major. But look... Like this? Cornelis, if you can take a step forwards... - Like that. One more. A bit more... - Here? - There? - Sorry. Good. Let's turn the shot slightly. Exactly! If you can turn... There! Perfect. Let's take... Hold this. - Now fool about a bit. - So this is my guitar! You're a bit too tall, Fred, that's all. Tall and handsome. Great! Are you with me? My buddy Per is gone now he's no longer here He ended up in a row with someone he held so dear She said, "get lost I don't wanna see your arse in here again" So Per took his son from school it was the last time I saw him then. My buddy Per has buggered off I wonder where he's at He got ripped off by his woman I reckon he was desperate Maybe he's gone to sea again to Slam and Singapore Or maybe he's locked himself away to shed tears there on the floor. Is it rehab for my buddy Per? You might well think it so He boozed to drown out his despair just to have somewhere to go... Good day! After a Mustang or something? - Cornelis. - A pleasure. Just come in, recently serviced, V8 engine. Leather upholstery. Quick sale, 25,000. They won the Second World War with this stuff! So let's hang around and try and win the third! I met an old mate the other day... ...who I hadn't seen for ages. We stopped to say hi. "Hi, "said he. "Hi, "said I. "Nice to see you, "said I. Said he, "Yeah, I suppose it is quite nice." "Can't complain, that much is true." "You know I went and got married..." "...in November, 62." I'd never want anything to happen to you. ..."I'm not playing guessing games!" I said, "Guess again!" So what's all this then? I'm terribly sorry, constable, but I'm a little unsteady on my feet. If I could see your driving licence... - I really didn't mean to. - Just show me your licence! Well, I'm afraid I don't have one. I don't need one. - I'm not even a Swedish citizen. - No? But I am a citizen of the world! OK, party over. Give me the booze. - Olsson! - It's stuck - Hand it over. A poor singer is what you see now Mr Plod's all cross with me! - Out of the car. - Good morning, constable. Citizens... ...I'd like to do an up-tempo, crude little number now. If that'd be to your liking... It's about a slob. Not that I know any... But I've heard about them. It goes like this... I'm just trash, I'm a swine I like it rough, but you are so fine You drink wine just to taste it but I drink wine to get wasted The likes of me should be locked away wouldn't you say. You home is nice, I've no address Your life's secure, mine is a mess You drive cars of the flashiest styles With your little stick ladies and their silly profiles. How nice to sleep till late in the day wouldn't you say. "Singer's groovy songs a smash hit" "Cornelis charged Doesn't give a damn" "Vreeswijk in court: Driving drunk without licence" "Dangerous and unsuitable for children" "Generally offensive" - See you at the bar? - See you at the bar. "CORNELIS IS FIRST ARTIST TO BOYCOTT SOUTH AFRICA" 1965 LP charts Well I'm just trash, born on the floor My pa was an alky and ma was a whore My dad died with his head down a drain Yours died with a bullet to the brain 'Twas his way of giving the au revoir to your ma I'm just a bum, you're a cool cat I'm just an arse, and that is that But I'll still be alive when you're dead Carving elegies in stone to lay at your head Death without cause, life without goal, without soul. Thank you. If you feel like smoking... Fancy a smoke? Then let me tell you that we do too. This is no advert for cigarettes. If you smoke, you die. You die if you don't smoke too! That was "Two birds on a branch" by Siw Malmkvist. We're unable to play the next request, "Bum blues"by Cornelis Vreeswijk. We'll have to play another song by him, and hope it'll do instead. But we warn sensitive listeners about the lyrics. What the fuck...? To Communications Minister Olof Palme. Since it has come to my attention that Swedish Radio is censoring my songs- -I have to take the following action... SINGER BANS RADIO Thanks. Is it true you've banned the radio from playing your songs? - That's right. - But it can't make financial sense. You may be right. But in this case I felt it was the right thing to do. All I do is write about life. I can't help what it looks like. - How about your career so far? - Career? For me it's all about the music. My "career" is being on the dole. And now you have a family to come home to. That must be a nice contrast to life on the road. Yes indeed. I realise I am a very lucky man. Thank you. Excuse me, a photo? Thanks. - Not much to write home about there. Oh, I missed! Hi! How big you've grown! A real man! Look what I've got for you! - How are you, my prince? - Look who's here. - Don't you recognise your old dad? - You open it. - Hi. - Hi. - You smell nice. - Thanks. What a circus, eh? - Have they been up here too? - No. We'll have to change numbers again. And some papers came from the police. - You look pretty. - Thanks. - Is it new? - Yep. You've rearranged the furniture too. Not really... How's it going, Jack? So where's the train? There it is, in the tunnel! Must never drink ever. - No? Why not? - It'll make you sick. Sleep o little prince of mine as the lights I douse Father's off to the factory line Mother will watch the house Sleep my little prince tonight Father's off to the factory site We work our lives away until the break of day. The moon is shining big and bold in the night so bare Life's game of chance I'm told nobody is spared Complaining is no use my friend banners, placards in the end your hunger cannot quell the truth, my Prince, I tell. - Here we are! - You've bought a house-boat? Why not? I need somewhere to write. - But can we really afford it? - Don't you worry about that. - It's really rocky! - It's nice. We can work here all night long without disturbing anyone. There you are! What do you say? Rio! Brazil! It'll be cool! I've got to tour with these guys first. I don't think I'm up for a shoot. Think about it. Once I had a boat With sail, cabin and keel But that was a long time ago a long time ago Answer me do Where is it now? All I'm asking is where is it now? There once was a town with children playing in the park Until they dropped the bomb and the town disappeared Answer me do Where is it now? All I'm asking is where is it now? Fuck! That's everything I own! It's all I have! The pontoons split, apparently. Then it let in water and sank. Some of it can be... They've salvaged quite a bit... What's this? It's from the police. "Verdict and sentence." "Drunk driving", "Unlawfully in charge of a vehicle". "8 weeks' incarceration in Bogesund prison. To be served immediately." We'll have to cancel the tour. Places everybody! Look happy! - Are you going to sit there all day? - I've got a gippy tummy, see. Cut! It's not working. We're looking for Cornelis Vreeswijk. - He's not here. - Can we come in? I've got another idea. I thought we might... We'll start here. Dance with them! Ow! Shit! - My prince! Hello. Blue? That's a lovely name. - Hi there, little Blue! Where are we going now? Are we going home? CORNELIS BEHIND BARS - How's the foot? - It's OK. The pain's still there... Only two weeks left. I must say you've been a model prisoner during your time here. Thank you. That's good to hear. Today's news. Singer Cornelis Vreeswijk escaped tonight from Bogesund prison. He'd been serving a 2-month sentence for drunk and unlawful driving- -and had only two weeks left to serve. Hi! You fucking bastard. DIVORCE APPLICATION Hi there, Prince. I'm in a place where you learn to behave better. Because it's important to behave. Love is like a Roman candle Like a Roman candle quick to flare It burns so hot when mishandled My soul is like a Roman candle And ephemeral is its glare. Mr Vreeswijk, how was life behind bars? - Will you behave yourself now? - Oh yes. I'll be a good boy. One more photo, Cornelis. Cornelis! You know it'll soon be high time you got down to a new project. The Rio album was a long time ago. Loads of talented guys have called to ask to play with you. "No matter what". Good, eh? Apart from that, we've got a contract, you and I. I know, but I... I just haven't got round to it. You're always welcome to work back at our place... DEBTS BILL FINAL DEMAND He's sick. Maybe we will have to take him to the hospital? What is it? What's got into you? - They've bugged my home! - Who? - The Security Police. - Why would they bug you? Look! A tapping wire. I'm sorry, OK? I'm so sorry. - Come with me, boy. - No, don't do this! - Calm down! - No! I want him with me! Cornelis! No! No! There you are. Hey, we need someone to lead the drinking songs in there! - I'll be right in. - OK. - Escaping the party too, huh? - Yes. - I haven't got the energy. You? - I'm not really in the mood. - I don't know that many people there. - Me neither. But everyone knows you. You know no one, but everyone knows you. Right! Something like that. Or rather, that's exactly it. - Cornelis. - Bim. - Hello, Bim! - Hello. I'd eat the tails and chuck the rest away. Until I was told off by someone: "That's absolutely forbidden!" - You're a pro, obviously. - Why is that so obvious? Because it is... There's something professional about you. - Is that a compliment? - Oh, yes! Such a beautiful woman reading "Catch 22". - That's a bit prejudiced...! - Not at all. I'm not prejudiced. I'm just a little old-fashioned. - Is that so? - Yes it is. - I don't believe that for one moment. - But that's the way it is. Was that allowed? - Here's to us, and a fresh start! - Cheers. We'll have time for all this now, you and I. Go to restaurants, the cinema, whatever you want. You've hardly touched your food. - When are we going to the cinema? - If you eat up, we can go right away. - Here you are. I've been looking for you. - I'm dining with my son. Hi, Jack. - You've got a gig in an hour. The band's in the minibus waiting. Come on! I'll take care of Jack and deal with the bill. OK. When are we going to the cinema? Another time. Come on, put your jacket on. We have to go. Goodbye. Come on, let's wave goodbye to Daddy. - Well, here he is. At last. - Hi. ...and there's one ugly fellow, and one handsome and one yellow in the paintings that you make All just for your own sake Do you see that Jack? You have to paint like that. And Pa must work and Ma's gone away The TV's soon off for the day You must always do as Ma said She sent you to bed But your painting's nearly done so finish it my son Do you get that, Jack, do you see? 'Cos I need you to show it to me. - Who's idea was this? - it was mine! I confess. We have to tune our guitars. A little naked song. There's a seagull living on my roof it is so nice and white It's there every summer day And when it feels like it it just flies away It sounds like John Coltrane in some kind of cat-fight And if it's laughing or not I can't say No, if it's laughing or not I can't say. Jack! Jack, come here now. - Congratulations on the new album. - Thanks! - It's a huge hit. - Yes, it's great. Leaving Stockholm like that and moving down south. It was very sudden. It was, wasn't it. Where do you get your titles from? "Poems, ballads and a little blues"... I figured that that was exactly what it was. Poems, ballads and a little blues. - Unless you have a better idea? - Oh, no. I'll leave that up to you. - And now it's pop. - You're right there. Well, what a contrast! - This is lovely. What is it? - Ice tea. Delicious. You don't feel guilty living in the lap of luxury like this... ...despite being a communist? Can tiny little people fly? Wasn't it difficult to come here and leave the city life you were used to? When Bim showed up, I knew at once that this little lady was very special. Sometimes people come into our lives at just the right time. Hallelujah! Can I have some shots of the rings? "Appeals not lodged within 8 days of invoice date will not be considered." 49,300 kronor. Know what you do with one of these? This is what you do. It's for your own good. I'm just trying to help. Carry on like this, and you'll go down again, you know that. 50,000. That's all. And then the house is mine. Where am I to get 50,000 from? The taxman's at the door. He's checking out your gigs. The state's taking all your royalties. Don't tell me what and what not to do. I'll only go somewhere else, you're not the only one. I don't know if you've grasped that. A lot of people want to work with me. - Well if that's how you feel... - Too fucking right I do. ...there was this guy in Stockholm- -who was going to get some money for me but they grassed me up... Hi. - You're late. - It took longer than expected. How's it gone? Get anything done? So what was it that took so long? Things dragged out and then it took time to get a taxi. - So what do you do at these meetings? - You know what. It's a reading group. - So what do you discuss? - The books we've read. Surely you don't just talk about books? - Do you talk about me? - No, we don't talk about you. Sure you do. You and all those women. I bet there are lesbians there too. All horrified over how you can be married to me. I bet they all fancy you too. Stop it. We talk about the books we've read. - Why can't you do that with me? - I do. We talk too. Obviously not. - Have you met someone else there? - No. No I haven't. - Why not? - I have no need to. - If you do, we're over. Understand? - I can't have this discussion again! So why can't you just tell me what you talk about? Cornelis! Cornelis! What the fuck are you doing? Are you out of your mind? Are you OK? Touch my wife again, and I'll kill you. Hear me? What the hell do you take me for? You need help. - I'll kill you! - Calm down. On stage, you sweat... But at least you get the feeling that you've done a good job. And left no one unsatisfied. No one goes home in tears. That's good. That's very good. That's good, Cornelis. Good. Really. Mr Blue's at the window staring through at me Golden is my thirst I raise a glass or three Raise a glass to this old schooner Mr Blue comes closer knocks upon my door Mr Blue will not leave my heart is sore - Hi. Silas. - Yes, I remember you. - Yeah? Fancy coming out for a jam? - Starting something new, are you? - Bigger things. - Is that so? 'Cos I'm not happy with my old stuff. I need something new... Take me out to sea leave Mr Blue alone Golden is his thirst but I sail on Raise a glass to this old schooner. FOR SALE What the...? Fred! - I'm not talking to you. - Why not? You've sold out. You've sold out to Mammon. I work. I'm doing the right thing. I happen to think there's honour in it. Don't touch me, you capitalist. At least I don't just sit around my allotment living on royalties! How dare you... You don't know how close you are! - Eva, my name is Åke. - Åke. - And what was your name? - Berit. Come and dance. God, I love this song! What the fuck...? What the fuck is this? What the fuck...? What the fuck are you playing at? Are you trying to fuck me over? Bum trip, man. Right, you're fucking for it! Try to fuck me over, will you? No one fucks me over, got it? Now fuck off! Get the fuck out! Get out! Out! I'm bleeding. Shit, I'm bleeding! I'll get you for this, you bastard! CORNELIS Singer in knifing scandal CORNELIS IN PRISON AGAIN! Mr Vreeswijk? You're due on stage now. I'd like to do a song... ...called "Morning grimace". - Do "Agda the hen"! - A song close to my heart. The dew is falling the sun is rising but all this you cannot hear You're lying unclothed and enticing with your lips against my ear Be serious now, you order me you laugh songs and sing in glee You can but will not sing of happiness, that fragile thing - Sing "Camp Granada"! - Shut up! Don't you want to hear a good song? "Camp Granada"! OK. You've only got yourselves to blame, Lidköping. The navel of the world. I've taken off my glasses so I don't have to see them. Hello Mudder hello Fadder here I am at Camp Granada And it's very entertaining And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining... Hi, Jack! - Hi! - Hi, Anita. - How are things? - Fine. Your dad's over there. Hi. - How are you, my boy? - Good, Dad. Why are you sitting here? I like it. It's the only time I get some peace and quiet. I can get some work done. - How was it at your grandma's? - Great. Really nice. Let's see. Application for Swedish citizenship. Fill in this form... ...and hand it in with proof of your ability to speak and write Swedish- -along with a countersigned copy of your ID papers. Proof? Surely you could provide that yourself? It mustn't be someone at the Migration Office, but someone who knows you. Someone who can vouch for your language skills. An old teacher, maybe. I'm a song-writer, you know. Record them on records, perform them to audiences. - Maybe you've heard some of them? - I'm sorry, but rules are rules. If it had been up to me... I don't know if you know, but they're written in Swedish. I can also tell you that I came to Sweden when I was a little boy. After the War. I was 12! Then I went to a Swedish grammar school. A former teacher would be fine. Perhaps there's someone you can contact? Yes, well...thank you. CORNELIS bankrupt 412,000 IN DEBT Lay spruce twigs in my cot and have me naked born My mother lay awake till morn But frightened I was not Deep down in the pit there cower those who live in fear of power If the cold is what you dread Lay spruce twigs in my bed Lay spruce twigs in my bed Lay twigs upon my desk and of my ink partake Our nest come help me make... What do you mean, nobody's buying tickets? I've been booked to do a gig there. For quite a long time, in fact. You can't just cancel. No? I see. Goodbye. Hi there! Cornelis Vreeswijk here. All's well in sunny Hudiksvall? Yeah, fine, fine. Yeah, listen... I'm sitting here...wondering... ...if you've got any evenings when you can squeeze in an old folk singer. Jack? Hang up, I'm in the middle of a call. Jack! Hang up, I'm in the middle of a call! Yes, thanks, thanks. Christ, Jack. I was in the middle of a call! Hang up, I need to make some calls. - Who are you talking to. - None of your business. Hello? Hello? - Going behind my back, eh? - Jesus, you're so fucking paranoid. Cornelis, everything will be alright. Won't it. CORNELIS VREESWIJK DRAGGED FROM FLAMES SOLNA ALCOHOL REHAB CENTRE, 1986 - Hi. - Good to see you. You know the set-up. No booze. An old junkie once walked into a police station His shoes were wet his eyes were glass His silent tongue was numb of all sensation So he could neither sing, squeal nor grass... Cornelis! How are things? - Right now I just need to be here. - I know. How's that? The first charge is drunk driving and driving without a licence. On the first occasion you were found asleep in your car. And your car was parked on a motorway slip road... ...ran a check and found that your licence was issued in Cyprus. There was a fire in your home, after which the police found a shotgun... What have you done this time, eh? Got a season ticket? Listen, I think you're great. But you have to pay tax, right? I mean, you can't not... You're like, "I care about my mates, I'm so good, I sing about them..." It's hypocrisy! Not everyone can piss off abroad as soon as the heat's on. - Hey, we can take a beer. On me. - Thanks, no. Goodbye. Alky! Fuck off back to Belgium then! I'm guilty on all counts. So I'd like to thank your honour. Mr Troll, Mr Troll, where are you? Here I am! Mr Vreeswijk, you must undergo the necessary medical regimen... ...to have any chance of overcoming your alcohol dependency. Times are hard now. Harder than I thought. - Who have you talked to? - Different people. Then I had an idea. I've got a mate with his own studio. He hires it out and I thought I'd pay some musicians from my own pocket... - What, you produce? - Why not? So four lovely angels took his heart from his bones And with his needle in a bag they placed it Then they slowly drifted up to their heavenly thrones It's getting late Time to quit. I've had a look at you. We're a little worried about your diabetes. I guess I haven't been that careful. - Who prescribed you your insulin? - A doctor in Denmark. I'm afraid we've found something else. We took a look at your liver, as you've been having problems. See this white section? It's a malignant tumour that has well and truly established itself, I'm afraid. You can see a large piece here that... - Can't it be removed? - It's had too much time to develop. We can give you painkillers, but that's all we can do. You must be prepared that it can be very quick. I wonder which genius came up with this idea. You'd almost think it was Candid Camera! And then they'll play it on the news as final proof that I'm passé. Maybe they had to fulfil their quota of old geezers to get their state subsidy! Who's this monkey? Down to the right. OK, my friends. You're on. I think that little shrimp has put us on the wrong stage. OK, guys. This ain't going to be easy. Shut your eyes and think of the Queen, as they say in England. Are you having a good time? Here he is.: Cornelis Vreeswijk! Citizens... Good evening! Some people we meet wear rags on their feet Tell me why should that be? Perhaps God above in his heavenly seat Has said that's how it should be. Perhaps God above in his heavenly seat Just sleeps away his days Who cares about some old rags on the feet When you're old, tired and grey. Who cares how they spend their days They just saunter along Citizen, in one hundred years You will be long, long gone. Here. The metre's hit 250 kronor. Are you getting out? - Here.
