( VOICE ) I know you're here with someone else. But does he make you happy? Does he know about your interests? I mean, does he really know about them? Does he spend weeks raising a boat from the ocean floor just for your viewing pleasure? - Thought it might make a good photo. Does he pay someone to release a watch of nightingales at just the right moment? - What's wrong? - Nothing... - Rusty! Release the birds! Does he know, neurochemically, how to make you happy? - You have modulation of sensory... - ...Activation of limbic system... - ...Increased oxytocin... ( MOANING ) - ...Orgasm is achieved. ( MOANING ) I know how to make you happy. If we were here together, I would do all these things and we would be happy. Am I crazy to think we would be happy? THE INFINITE MAN ( WATCH BEEPING ) - What? - Didn't you call ahead? - There was no answer. - Well, this would be why. - I don't believe it! At this time last year we were playing musical instruments over there... Fine dining in there... Adult activities upstairs... I didn't know they closed down, I am so sorry. I am stupid. - Look, it doesn't matter. Let's go to the beach instead. - The beach. I had a dream about the beach last night. - Great. Maybe it's a sign. - No we can't. I've drawn up ths schedule based on last year, you see? This was perfect. - It was. It was also a year ago, and things change. Motels shut down, and people move on. - I hold in my hands the blueprint to a perfect weekend, and if we stay...if we follow this very precisely, then... - That's why we're dressed in the same clothes as last year. - I love you in that dress. I guess it's a controllable variable. - I am taking this stuff to the. I am taking these clothes off. I am driving to the beach and I am going for a swim. - Lana, please, I mean surely a... a deep tissue massage is preferable to fighting? - Oh, we're not fighting. - Are we not massaging? - No, no, because I didn't come all the way out here just to do exactly what we did on our last anniversary. - No, of course not. - It's nuts. - It is, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - You feel tense. - Yeah, it's just... - Please... - I'll be in the car. - Do you know where I'll be? Upstairs with these babies and some fractionated coconut oil. Massaging not masturbating! - Lana! Welcome! Glad you came back! I think it scrubs up ok. I've bypassed the main switch board. I found the mattress next door. Those sheets aren't washed, don't touch those sheets. And...the beach. So... Now, I had planned a musical celebration of your Dutch ancestry for...about now. But... ( TEARS PAPER ) - You do not have to do that... - Don't worry, I have copies. It's a symbolic gesture. The point is we can do whatever you like. - I don't know...surprise me. ( PLAYING ACCORDION ) - My love, Dutch klompens, should the bass line seize you. ( BOTTLE POPPING ) - Eat! Eat! The menu might be a year old, but the food certainly isn't. ( LAUGHTER ) Except for the dolmades but they last forever. ( SPRAYS MOUTH ) - Lana! - Yea? - Sexual congress in five! - For our last anniversary I spent months studying the blue arts... at least in erotica, Tantric techniques... - The Viennese oyster. Oh! Depressed Elephant. - I couldn't wait to try it on someone other than myself, but when the moment finally arrived, I... well I achieved cosmic consciousness faster than I would have liked. - Your cosmic consciousness was just fine. - It could have been more tantric, that's all. Yes - What's this? - This...this is more stimulating than Tantra. - Well, Happy Anniversary indeed. - Something I've been developing at the lab. It is an external limbic system. So this moment in time will be encoded in here... and stored... in here. - And this is stimulating? Intellectually, yes. The hope is... that we can retrieve this moment with complete accuracy. Every detail, every sensation. We can return to this moment in time, over, and over... and over. This is your anniversary present. - Wow. I got you a Bunsen burner. ( CAR PULLING UP ) ( HORN HONKING ) - Terry! - Terry? No! - You really need to tell him it's over. You've broken up. - What are you doing here, Terry? - I thought you should know that you left some washing on your line. - You drove three hours to tell me that. - I submit these. Somebody could have stolen them. - Hey! Did she tell you that I threw javelin at the Olympics? Yea, I upset the establishment, with my politics, and my drug taking. When they came to take my medals from me... I threw them, like a javelin...off the balcony. The officials got the medals... - This has to stop Terry. We broke up four years ago. - Yeah, well now I am back. ( INAUDIBLE CHATTER ) - This is unbelievable. Every time, every time he ruins it. - It's a long drive, maybe he jt needs to stretch his legs then he'll leave. - What is he getting from the car? - His javelin. - This is too much! - And a pack of condoms and some kind of cattle prod. - What kind of stretch is this? - Hey Lana! Do you still have that bifurcated dildo? Or should I grab one from the car? - That was for him, not for... - Okay, that's it! - Terry! Terry, no, you will not ruin another holiday! ( ZAPPING SOUND ) ( SILENCE ) ( COUGHING ) - This is our chance. let's just...take these helmets. Hop in the car. We'll leave him here. Find a beach, some cold beers... a nice B & B. - Lana! Lana! You can take him, and you can go to the beach, but you can't take these. I never want to see you again. - What? That's not funny. - Yeah? What about self immolation? - Stop it! - Is that funny? Setting myself on fire? I don't have a lighter, I need to borrow someone's lighter. - Here. - Don't! Stop it! - Fire! Fire! I will do it, I swear I will! I'm a man with nothing to lose! - This is insane, Dean, what... What is that? What is this stuff? - It Is ginger wine... - That's not... - It's really sticking to my skin... ( FLICKS CIGARETTE ) - No! No! Enough! What the... ( INSULT IN FRENCH ) I don't think you appreciate the things I do. And you, you... ( THROWS WINE ) ( LAUGHTER ) - This jacket is inflammable. ( ANGRY GROWL ) - Stop it! Stop it! - I never want to see you again, just go. Go, go on! Go! Get Out of here! - Dean... ( CAR DOOR OPENING ) ( ENGINE STARTING ) ( CAR DRIVING AWAY ) ( SOBBING ) ONE YEAR LATER ( LOUD BANG ) ( PHONE RINGING ) - Happy Anniversary! Guess where I am? Lana? Hello? Lana, look, I know it's been a year since we last spoke. But I need to see you. I heard you moved to the beach. Maybe you thought I'd just forget about you. Well I haven't. After you left, I stayed out here... I needed some time alone. Twelve months in our old room. Thinking about stuff. Trying to keep busy. I don't believe I am a jealous man,but I have been thinking... about you and him, and your...position. I know I drove you away, but I've been building something. I had some things setup from the lab and I've been working on something that I think might take us back to how things were. I think we should give it one more go, please. Things will be different this time. Look, no need to say anything. Just give me a sign. ( DIAL TONE ) - Identifying instability in a closed loop circuit. Short the voltage source, open the loop in the fourth pass. then apply a test signal and observe the gain and phase around the loop. Make sure the voltage source... - Dean! - Dean! - Hello. - Hi. Hello. You look different. - Different? - More stable. - Oh, I am. I'm very stable. I want us to try things again. - Again? - Please? - I do not know if I can do tha. - Why not? Have you been with him this last year? - Isn't that what you wanted? - What? No. I...I did so much for you. We played songs. Dutch songs. We ate dolmades! I had planned some very, very Tantric stuff, it was going to be the perfect day, and... - You threatened to set me on f. - Yes, but prior to that... - Then you called me a whore. - Sounds better in French. - And all Dutch folk dancing in the world isn't going to change that. - Well no, that would be... Why would you even suggest it? - Because you're wearing clogs. - The clogs are incidental... - See? You're doing it again. It's going to be just like last time. - No, not this time. I am in control of things now, I can change. - Stop. I don't want you controlling everything. It always feels like your... controlling me. - I would never would control you. Please, just tell me what I can. - Nothing. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. If I could change I would, but I can't, so we both just have to... - What if I could? Just wait here. - Where are you going? - To change out of these clogs. I need shoes for where we're going. What about now are you guys still...together? - It's complicated. - Good. I can work with that. - Dean! What are you doing up there? ( MUSIC PLAYING ) - Happy Anniversary. - Is this why you got me out he? - There's more. ( SNIFFING ) The ocean. - I came straight from the beac. - The beach? Why? - I was worried about you. You just... - About me? - Does this mean you're giving me a chance? - Yes. I'm giving you a chance. - There's something I want to show you. - One year ago, we recorded something onto this drive. Since then I've been working a retrieval system. Something to get what's on here... into here. - And what is on there exactly? - The past. A point in time. - Our anniversary weekend. - This will take us there. - You still have the Bunsen burner I gave you. - I've kept the flame alive all this time. - Is that even possible? - Changing the propane can be difficult, but...it's achievable. ( COMPUTER HUMMING ) - It wasn't the best weekend though, was it? - No, it wasn't. - So why do you want to re-live it? - I do not want to re-live it... I want to change it. ( WATCH BEEPING ) - What? - Didn't you call ahead? - There was no answer. - Well, this would be why. - I don't believe it! At this time last year we were playing musical instruments over there... Fine dining in there... Adult activities upstairs... I didn't know they closed down, I am so sorry. I am stupid. - Look, it doesn't matter. Let's go to the beach instead. ( LAUGHTER ) - This is the past! ( LAUGHTER ) This is...this is... this is...definitely the...the past! - This was meant to be, the perfect weekend and it wasn't. - No. - But this time it will be. It will be... perfect. And when Terry arrives I will knock him off the balcony with his own javelin. You'll stay with me, and she'll stay with him... - We traveled one year into the past just so you can hit Terry with a stick? - No. Well... Yes, it was one of the reasons. But why would you be defending him? - I am not... I am not defending him. - I'll be in the car. - No no! - I'll be in the car. - Not this time, please. Just let me show you what I have planned. - Do you know where I'll be? Upstairs with these babies and some fractionated coconut oil. Massaging not masturbating! - This is a copy of the original schedule. Marked up areas of improvement, here, here and here. Then we'll do the whole thing again but this time, we will do it right. There will be better songs, more champagne coitus uninterruptus. And then, see...the beach. You and me. The schedule. Now, was it a deep tissue massage in the old room? Or... - I don't know. - Well just look at the schedule. - I thought things were going to be different Dean. They will be! It's not going to be like last time. - Lana! Welcome! Glad you came back! I think it scrubs ok. I've bypassed the main switch board. - I found a mattress next door.. - Dean. - Those sheets aren't washed... - And...the beach You came back! - I found this in the car. - "Some additional notes for the weekend, by Dean Trilby." - They're just some random thou. - ''Chapter One..." "the history of pleasure." ( SCOFFS ) It's hardly a history. - "Subsection A..."The Dawn of Man" " I know how much this means to you. So...let's take a look at that anniversary suite. ( DOOR CREAKING ) ( FLIES BUZZING ) - Unfortunately our old room is a bit of a mess. So... - It's different. - Yea, it is...different. Twice. Sorry, it was meant to be an improvement. - Well, what are the other agenda items? Musical celebration of your Dutch ancestry. - Yea... - Hey! - There's supposed to be Dutch folk music, and don't even have a damn rummelpott. - Shhh. Can you hear that? Listen... Where is that coming from? ( ACCORDION PLAYING ) - Shall we eat? ( BOTTLE POPPING ) - Well, what are our options? Hunting? Roadkill? Soil? ( SNIFFING ) Wait? ( SNIFFING ) - Is that? ( OPENS DOOR ) - I could swear there's lobster... ( SHUTS DOOR ) - Lana, Lana! Wait! Wait! Lana! Lana! ( GASPING ) - It is lobster! - In a white wine sauce! I'am going to go upstairs and go get your anniversary present. Just wait here. Love you! - I love you! - Dean! ( GASPS ) - What are you doing? - Waiting for you? - Where's Dean? - Upstairs, something about cosmic consciousness. Are you planning to have sex with her? - What? No! ( GASPS ) - Yes you are! I remember you said you were going to get my anniversary present. You were going to have sex with her and record it on your brain thing. That is...I am not planning to have sex with her. - Lana? - Yea? - Sexual congress in five. - You said it really tough time. - Yes, but what about me? - You both! - I traveled through time. - I realize that. - Well, maybe I should just go have sex with him. - Him and her? - Uh Hm. - Firstly, that's a paradox. Second, legally... like a threesome like that... - Well, maybe if it's not to paradoxical we could have sex. - Me and you? - That's part of the...schedule. - All my Tantra books are in the other room. - Oh it doesn't matter. - Do wish we had the head pieces.. - We don't need the head pieces. - It would just be better, that's all. - Hey, just forget about the books, and the head pieces, and everything else. Just close your eyes... and put it out of your... ( CAR PULLING UP ) ( CAR HORN HONKING ) ( SIGHING ) Terry. - Look at him. Look at his body. - "The vessel for honorable use. It's what he calls it. - You once said he was more... ( SIGHING ) athletic in bed? - Oh come on! I am not going to talk about this. - Please, we need to talk about it. - Just different influences. Terry's approach to sex is very...old Testament. You know, sword and sandals, blood and guts. - And what would you say are my sexual influences? - Oh, I do not know, do not know! Dialectical theater. German philosophy. The metronome. Pythagoras. - Pythagoras? - Yea. It's just different. - You want blood and guts, I'll give you blood and guts. - I want you to let it go. - Twelve months preparing for this moment. - Let it go. Five minutes? I'll come back. We'll go for a swim. We'll catch some rays, some sun, a few... Please, just...wait here. Pythagoras... - I should say... that I didn't come here...stric. on account of your underwear. I had other business. - Does this too involve my underwear? - Terry! - Indirectly, yes. - Terry... - Your javelin. - We are working ourselves into a cycle here. - I just...want to hold the javelin. - This javelin... It puts me in a line. A long line... from Greek gods to mortal men. Greek men. Please just give me the javelin. - Dean. Just let him toss his damn stick. - Lana, wait please, I am doing this for us. - This has nothing to do with me. - Not the window! ( THUD ) ( GASPING ) ( COUGHING ) - This is our chance. Let's just take these helmets Hop in the car. We'll leave him here. Find a beach, some cold beers... A nice B & B. - I never want to see you again! Go. Go! Get out of here! - Dean... - Lana. Lana, open up. Open the door. Why did you do it? I thought... I thought things were improving! Why him? I tried to stop it. I've tried so hard! I've traveled through time for you! Who else would do that for you? Who are you? - Shhh. Let's walk and talk. - Tell me. Who you are? - I'm from the future. - My future? - Yes. You know, I've worked to hard for you to screw this up for me. - I want to see her. - No. She doesn't want to see you. - You told her she doesn't want to see me? - Definitely implied. - I do not believe you. - You should trust yourself. - There are things I need to tell her. - I've all ready told her. - I'll tell her myself. - What's the difference? - Okay, you know what I do? - Yes, I do. - I'll go back to the present I'll... - No, no you can't, that's not possible. - You can't get her forever. And when you least expect it, when you've forgotten I even exist... That's when I will come. Because you may have her now, but I have the element of surprise. ( MANIACAL LAUGHTER) - What's that? - Read it. - "You can't get her forever. And when you least expect it, when you've forgotten I even exist... That's when I will come. Because you may have her now, but I have the element of surprise." - You'll try a few more times in the next year, then in twelve months you will do the sensible thing and you will travel back for her. - Twelve months? - It worked for me. ( LAUGHTER) - You know she doesn't love you? She loves him. Terry. - Not anymore. - Why? What did you do? How did you do it? - Watch and learn. - This isn't fair I love her too! - Yeah. Join the queue. - Just... It's just... ( SOBBING ) ( SINGING ) - Lana? I need you to listen to me. You are caught in a very complicated... - It was the only way. - I had no... - I had to use a toilet. It's the only way to keep you from her. - There are other ways... - It was the only way. - What about the lipstick? - It was the only way. - Don't. No. ( CRYING ) ( MASTURBATION SOUNDS ) ( MOANING ) - Glad you could meet me out here, Lana. I have a lot of things I want to tell you. You look worried. Don't be.

( LOUD BANG ) Remember this? You went to call her. Asked her to come out here. - Happy Anniversary! - What made her choose someone like you, over me. - We're not that different, you and me. - Then why? Why you? - I do not know, maybe it's for your crying. - Stop it! Stop it! - What I'am not crying... It's just...it's the steam from the coffee. - It is quite steamy coffee. - Just why you... why you and not me? - I traveled back for her. - And what if I went back for her? Well, I guess that would make you... me. ( COMPUTER HUMMING ) ( KEYBOARD TYPING ) - This is unbelievable. Every time, every time he ruins it. - It's a long drive, maybe he jt needs to stretch his legs then he'll leave. - What is getting from the car? - His javelin. - This is too much! And a pack of condoms... and some kind of cattle prod. - What kind of stretch is this? - Hey Lana? Do you still have that bifurcated dildo? Or should I grab one from the car? - That was for him, not for me. - Okay, that's it! - Dean! - I should say that I didn't come here strictly on account... of your underwear. I have other business. - Does it still involve my underwear? - Terry! - Indirectly, yes. - Terry! - Your javelin. - We are working ourselves into a cycle... - We are working ourselves into a cycle here. - Terry! What are you doing here? Here and there? - Science. I used your helmet. - When? - In the future. - Dean. Just let him toss his damn stick. - Lana, wait, please. I am doing this for us. - This has nothing to do with me. - Eros... and Psyche. History. It's all Mediterranean. - Why did you come back? - Well, you came back and she came back, so I came back. I won't be excluded. - Not the window! ( THUD ) - Terry. Welcome to the future. ( STABBING SOUND ) ( GRUNTING ) ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( THUD ) - This can not be good. I've dreamt about this moment. Many Terry's. One Lana. Infinite sexual positions. - No, there must be a finite number positions. No. No there's no finite. No. I could not be here. I could be there. And I could be with her. Gonorrhea. - Sorry? - It is Greek. It means "flow of seed". Gonos...rhea. Does my seed flow? - No. There can't be more! - Where's Terry? - Oh! Thank God! I thought there were many, many, many Terry's. - This is our chance. Let's jus. take these helmets, hop in the car, we'll leave him here. Find a beach, some cold beers, a nice B & B. - Me? You want to go to the beach with me? - I do. - I'll meet you downstairs. - Okay. - I'm so sorry. - Look at him. That's the look of a winner. I've won. - But he's dead. You've killed him. - Still the winner. ( ZIPPING BAG ) - I'm sorry. I didn't know, I... I didn't know it was me. I'll tell you everything. I tried, more than once. Sometimes I just get so angry with myself. My other selves. I'm so sorry. - Hey, I know. - Plus, there was a second Terry. - A second Terry? - Yeah, he must have traveled back. - Why? - To be with you. - And where is he now? - He's dead. - Dead? - Well he's not...he's not going to take this very well. - We should tell him, because he has to know... - No he all ready knows. He did it himself. - He killed himself? - His other self yeah. - His other self? God. God it is so typical, it's so...it's... It's theater. It's Greek tragedy. That is what it is. You know he's not actually Greek. - I did...I did not know that. - What does this mean exactly? Is he alive or is he dead? - Well he's alive and dead. - What...what a sad man. - Well, it's just us now. - Lana? Lana open up. - I understand every relationship has it's problems, but this...this is really... - I am sorry, just wait here please I'll go talk to him. - I've traveled through time for you. - Who else would do that for you? - Is he watching us? - He is. For one whole year I did nothing but watch us. - You watched us for a year? - But we won't...we won't stay here for a year, I mean... We can't. - We did it. We were here...together. We were happy. Why would you want to change that? - I don't. I just...I just think we would be happier... somewhere else. - Look. One year from now he'll finish building the device. Everyone will travel back, and it will be just the two of us. Then we can go where ever we want, and not have to worry about these... people. I know you like the beach, just... Please trust me to get us through this. I know what to do. I've all ready seen us do it and it works. And I know in the meantime we can be...happy here. - Not now. - It's only one year, and... and summer always flies by, so it's like...nine months. Nine to twelve months. Twelve months. Then we can leave. - And what did we do exactly for the next...twelve months? - Do you remember our first actual date? - I do - I was nervous as hell. You were relaxed, talkative. Then I found your notes. Famous quotes, current affairs, topics of conversation. - Art, music, science. - Do you remember everything about that night? - Everything. In fact, I recorded it on tape. I wanted to review it after the date, and make sure that I sounded natural. - "Obviously it relies on the presumption of male hetrosexual spectatorship. Does that make it a bad painting? No." "And...of course..." "of course..." - "Dean, are you okay?" ( FAST FORWARDS TAPE) - "And of course there's George Brock..." Later I edited the tape, I spliced in a few gags... Thing's I didn't think of at the time. - "Getting Brock the basics, you might say..." ( LAUGHTER ) - That's not my laugh. - No, it's the closest I could find. - You know what this is? - What? - Just...one big revision. - It's an improvement, it's not... - Is this an improvement? - I would say so, yes. - Because sometimes it feels...a little unorthodox. - No... This is the modern world. It's a modern relationship. - What are you doing? - Going to the bathroom. To see if I can lure a Dean into a cubical. - See, I would say that's a little "unorthodox". - Unorthodox. I am a man responding to his environment. Have you got lipstick? - I don't want to say that you're living in the past - Well obviously, I am living in the past. - But, I mean... You say you fell disconnected. - Shhh. - Maybe that's why... you feel disconnected. Maybe if you just stop listening and watching... - What about you? - Well, what about me? - I see the way you look at him. - It's the same way I look at you. - Exactly. - So I do not want me to look at you? - No. Him. - Who? - Dean! - Are you jealous? - Should I be? - I do not even know how to answer that. - I used to watch us up here. I used to think we were happy. - We are happy. - We could be happier. - Why do you hate yourself so much? - Are you kidding? Look at him! Sorry. Just forget about it. Tomorrow everything returns to normal. Everyone travels back. And we're alone. Together. We can... go where ever we want. This is the plan. We do not touch a thing. Everyone travels back, just like they always have... and then we are alone. Okay? - Okay - Good. Okay. - Happy Anniversary. Don't worry, I am here to help. Okay, I was in the bedroom, testing the amp. - Dean! - You called out... I came down. The other Lana, where is she. She should be here by now. - I do not know. - Well, this is how it began, remember? With her down there. - Well maybe... - If Lana doesn't show, then Dean won't travel back... and if Dean doesn't travel back, then... Things will get very complicated. You have to go down there. - What? - Yea. Until the other Lana arrives, you have to go down there and say all the things she said. It has to be exactly the same. - It's nuts, it won't work! - It will work. It has to. It's the only way - But what if he takes me back with him? - That's impossible, it can't happen. You'll switch with the other Lana before then... they'll travel back and once they do... it's just you and me. It's simple. - How will I even know what to say? - Tape this to your chest. Put this in your ear. And I'll tell you exactly what to say. - You tell me what to say? No no. - Not tell, remind. Your words. I am just reminding you. Testing, testing. It is the only way to ensure they travel back. - And how do I know which one is him and which one is you? Just listen to your heart. Also, listen to the ear piece and will tell you. - Okay, stop there. Now call out his name twice. - Dean! Dean! - Ok, good. Now... He is going to come to you, just stay there and repeat what I say. - This is insane. This isn't going to work. - Shhh. Here he comes. - Hello - Hi. - Hello. - You look...different. - You look different. - Different? - More stable. - I am. I'm very stable. I want us to try things again. - Again? - Please? - I do not know if I can do that. - Why not? Have you been with him this last year? - Isn't that what you wanted? - What? No! I did so much for you. We played songs, Dutch songs. We ate dolmades! I had plans for very, very tantric stuff, It was going to be the perfect day... - You threatened to set me on fire. - Yes, but prior to that... - Then you called me a whore. - It sounds better in French... - And all Dutch folk dancing ine world isn't going to change that. - Well no, that would be... Why would you even suggest it? - Because you're wearing clogs. - The clogs are incidental... - See? You're doing it again. It's going to be just like last time. - No, not this time. I am in control of things now, I can change. - Stop! - I don't want you controlling everything. It always feels like you're controlling me. - I would never control you. Please, just tell me what I can do. - Nothing. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. If I could change it I would, but I can't, so... - What if you could? - Just wait here. - Where are you going? - To change out of these clogs. - I need shoes for where we're going. - What about now are you guys still...together? - It's complicated. - Good. - I can work with that. - Lana, where is she? She should be here by now. Where are you going? To change out of these clogs. I need shoes for where we're going. What about now are you guys still together? It's complicated. Dean, what are you doing? - Dean, what are you doing up there? - I'm just trying to... - Wait, which Dean are you talking to? Lana, please. You need to listen to me. Do not kiss him. Lana, please! ( MUSIC PLAYING ) No, no, no, you can not travel back! Lana, do you hear me? You can not travel back. It's not possible. It's not possible. Lana! It's not possible. It's not possible. - It wasn't the best weekend, though, was it? - No, it wasn't. - So why do you want to re-live it? - I don't want to re-live it. - I want to change it. - Lana... Think! Think, think... ( SCREAMING ) - I met you...at X... We traveled back... one year...to Y. We stayed for one year... at which point, you met him at X... and traveled back one year... to Y. ( HORN HONKING ) No, not now Terry! I have to go. - Can you feel this? I am in the business of energy fields. Man is frequency. Hologram bracelets. I have a suitcase full of them. They are an investment in the future. - What are you doing here Terry? - Terry... Terry's dead. I tried to get him to a hospital, but... he suffocated in the sports bag. - I'm sorry. - I had to bury him... in a salt pan. And ever since then, I've been driving in my car looking for her. And, spreading the word, making some... Why not, right? I'm on the road. I miss her. - I know. - I love her. - So do I. - Sometimes when I masturbate, I imagine myself as her. Masturbating... to a picture of me. - I'm sorry. - No, no, these are facts. I do not want your sympathy. - She's gone Terry. - Where? - Don't know. She's stuck in some kind of temporal loop. She's just going around, and around, and around, and around. - Temporal. Jesus. How does it work? Your science? Can you take me to her? - Why yes. But you've seen what will happen? Is that what you want? - What I want is for the sun to exhaust it's full and die. - But in the short term? - Even then. - Well... if that's what you want. ( KEYBOARD TYPING ) - Before it happens... I do get to see her again. Don't I? One more time? - Yes. - Okay then. - I'll just be...over there. ( COMPUTER HUMMING ) ( COUGHING ) - This is our chance. let's just...take these helmets. Hop in the car. We'll leave him here. Find a beach, some cold beers, a nice B & B. - Me? - You want to go to the beach with me? - I do. - I'll meet you downstairs. - Okay. - I'm so sorry. - Look at him. That's the look of a winner. I've won. - But he's dead. You've killed him. Still a winner. ( ZIPPING BAG ) - I never want to see you again. Just go. Go, go on! Go, get out of here! - Dean... Shit! He has taken the keys. - Could you drop me off at the bus station? - I can take you all the way if you want. - Geographically or sexually? - Does one preclude the other? - Either way. I'am going to need petrol money... - Bus station is fine. - Lana! I love you, Lana. - I know you do Terry... but we dated for two weeks. And that was four years ago. - Well, I think uh... it was never made clear to me that we had actually broken up. - Well, I'm sorry about that. - Apology accepted. - Okay, Terry. ( CAR DOOR OPENING ) ( ENGINE STARTING ) ( CAR DRIVING AWAY ) - Lana! Lana, wait! Thank you! Thanks for stopping! - We didn't stop. - We ran out of petrol. - Lana. I am sorry. I was jealous. Okay, I thought you were cheating on me with him. It sounds silly now, but I did, and I imagined you in every conceivable position The Viennese Oyster, Congress of the Cow, Depressed Elephant, and it drove me nuts. And I kept coming back to this place. These positions, and... then I got jealous of myself, and I created a very strange loop. But I think if we leave now we can break that loop. You just... Just hop in my car. We'll leave from here. We'll find a beach... Some cold beers... - Depressed Elephant? - It's when the woman... - Lana! - Look, Terry and I did a lot of things. - Abstract sexual things. - We experimented. - Why not? You're young, you're free. - Maybe we did the Depressed Elephant. - I can show you evidence. Photographic evidence. - It was years ago! - We're having some time apart. - It was over! - Recharging the batteries. - Finished! Many, many years ago. - Even if it wasn't, I am cool.. - Stop trying to please me! - Done. Stop. I am sorry. - I am going to walk to the station. - Great! I love the station. ( SCREAMING ) - Oh my god my hand! - Oh jesus! Dean! Jesus! Dean, Dean, Dean! - Okay, let me look, let me look, let me... Okay. I'll just... ( KNOCKING ) - What is that? - Nothing. The wind. - Inside your boot? - Yeah. Anyway, there wasn't even a sound. ( KNOCKING ) Excuse me. - Dean, where are you going? - I am going to the beach! No. Please, please. - Lana! - What? - I'am going to get him to a hospital. - Great! Thank you! Thank you! See? He is offering help. - I know. I'm so sorry. - So he'll go get petrol, and then we'll get the car started. Okay, he is insistent, but... he also has the capacity for real acts of kind... ( MUFFLED GRUNTS ) - Okay, hey, we need to get you to a hospital. - No. You just get me to the nearest coastal area. - Okay - Thank you. ONE YEAR LATER - Happy Anniversary. - Why are you wearing that dress? - I...I thought you liked it. - No, please, take it off. - Uhh...you take it off. ( PHONE RINGING ) - It's the phone. - Yeah, just...forget about it. - It could be important. - Happy Anniversary! Guess where I am? Lana? Hello? Lana, look, I know it's been a year since we last spoke. But I need to see you. I heard you moved to the beach. Maybe you thought I'd just forget about you. Well I haven't. After you left, I stayed out here... Think I needed some time alone. Twelve months in our old room, thinking about stuff. Trying to keep busy. I don't believe I am a jealous man,but I have been thinking... about you and him, and your...position. I know I drove you away, but I've been building something. I had some things setup from the lab and I've been working on something that I think might take us back to how things were. I think we should give it one more go, please. Things will be different this time. Look, no need to say anything. Just give me a sign. - Who was it? - I do not know. I have to go. - Why? - I thought we were safe. It's something I built. A closed loop system it's... ...it's unstable. - Dean... It's our anniversary. Just do it tomorrow. - I just need to open the loop. Identify the instability. And if I find you there... I'll save you from it. - But...I'm right here. - You are, but that doesn't mean you are not there too. Lord knows I am - Wait! - Identifying instability in a closed loop circuit. Short the voltage source... open the loop in the forth pass then apply the test signal and observe the gain and phase around the loop. ( ZAPPING SOUND ) Short the voltage source... and open the loop. - Dean! Dean! - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. - You look different. - Different? - More stable. - I am. I'm very stable. I want us to try things again. - Again? - Please? - I don't think I can do that. - Why not? Have you been with him this last year? - Isn't that what you wanted? - What? No, I did so much for you We played songs. Dutch songs. We ate dolmades! I had planned some very, very Tantric stuff, it was going to be the perfect day, and... - You threatened to set me on f. - Yes, but prior to that... - Then you called me a whore. - Sounds a lot better in French... - And all Dutch folk dancing in the world is not going to change that. - Well no, that would be... Why would you suggest that? - Because you're wearing clogs. - The clogs are incidental... - See? You're doing it again. It's going to be just like last time. - No, not this time. I am in col of things now. I can change... - Stop. I don't want you controlling everything. It always feels like your controlling me. I would never control you. Please. Tell me what I can do? - Nothing. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. If I could change it, I would, but I can't, so we just both have to... - What if I could? Please just wait here. - Where are you going? - To change out of these clogs. I need shoes for where we're going. What about now are you guys still together? - It's complicated. - Good. I can work with that. - Dean, stop. That's enough. - What are you doing? - I am going home. You've lost me! I have no idea what the fuck is going on. - I'm just... I'm just trying to help you! - This isn't helping. This is... I don't know. I don't know what this is... - Lana wait. Do you feel like you've been here before? - Constantly. - No, I mean this exact moment? - Dean! What are you doing up there? ( MUSIC PLAYING ) - Where did she come from? - She came straight from the beach. - The beach. You followed me from the beach? - I did. - Why? - I was worried about you. You just... - About me? Does this mean that you're me giving another chance? - Yes. - No. - No? - I do love you Dean. - Oh I love you too! I love so much! - I know. But it's not in a way that I can really see working. - What? I can make it work this... I mean, we've been through a rough patch, but... Please... Lana, please. - I have to go. I have to get out of these clothes. - I love you in that dress! - Why do you have to make things so complicated? - I was just trying to make it better. - Yeah? But what about flowers, or a box of chocolates... - That would have been simpler. I do love you though. - But I just can't endure it. - I understand You have to go. Yeah... It's me. I know it's me. Here. Inside here I don't think I ever believed you really loved me. - Why? Why would you think that? - I do not know. I'm just going through some stuff. Yeah? But I'm trying to get better. And if I do, if I do get better then I'll come back for you. - But not now. - No, not now. - It might take some time. - But I'll come back for you. - Okay. - Lana!
