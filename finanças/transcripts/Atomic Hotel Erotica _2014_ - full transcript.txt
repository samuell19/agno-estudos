[UPBEAT MUSIC] Mr. Grismer? Yes, Wilfred, what is it? Well, it appears that it's time to set out another set of invitations. Is it now, indeed? Well, you must get right on that. I wonder. Whom shall we pick this time? Hmm? Well, I've always been partial to the tall ones, sir. [CHUCKLES] So you have, my boy. That's fine. That's fine. Ah, this is an excellent choice. And tall, just for you. Well, thank you, sir. Let's get those invitations out right away. There's no time to lose. Yes, sir. [LAUGHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Honey, I can't stay for breakfast this morning. What's that, dear? I said, I can't stay for breakfast. I gotta get in the office early. I want to start working on that software program if I'm gonna get that big bonus. Bonus? Yeah. I told you about it last week. Mr. Millhouse said, anyone who can design a computer patch that can improve the speed of the search engine by 20% by the end of next week, is in for a big bonus. Ooh, I like the sound of that. My only competition at the office is Rob. That guy can be a real whiz when it comes to coding. Oh, sweetie, I'm sure you're better than he is. Well, I sure hope so. So do I. [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, I might have a little bit of time. [BREATHING HEAVILY] You're late, buddy. Yeah, I know. I've been spending the morning solving that pipeline air problem. Oh, really? That bonus is as good as mine. So what have you been doing? Well, to be honest with you, Elena wouldn't let me get out of bed this morning. Wait, you mean-- Yep. Nothing like a little morning pick me up, you know? You're lucky. How long have you two been married again? Next month will be a year. Wait until you've been married as long as I have. Laura and I haven't had sex in six months. Ooh. Sorry, man. Yeah. Why do you think I want that bonus so badly? I mean, if I-- strike that. When I get that bonus, I'm gonna take Laura on a nice getaway romantic vacation. Oh, yeah? That sounds really nice. But you're gonna have to get past me first. No problem. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Laura, I'm home. Hey, baby. Oh, you're not working tonight, are you? I was hoping we could go out. Sweetie, you know I've got to work. You want me to get that bonus, don't you? Well, we haven't been out dancing in months. We don't ever go out anymore. I don't know what to say. You know this is important. And I'm not? Is that what you're saying? Of course not. I'm doing this for you. Well, don't do me any favors. Ugh. Women. [KNOCKING] [LAUGHS] "Dear, sir. You are the lucky winner of an all expense paid weekend for four at the Atomic Hotel Erotica. A place where all of your fantasies can and will come true. Even those you didn't know you had." Wow. "For new young lovers or for those of you who just want to put the sparkle back in your love life." I'll say. "This is the place for you. You will be picked up--" Laura. Laura. What? What is it? You said you wanted to go out, right? Yes. Are we going out dancing? No. I told you I have to work. Oh, well, then what's the big deal? Check this out. Uh-huh. Is this for real? It's this weekend. I got the tickets right here. LAURA: Oh, baby. Uh-huh. But-- but it says it's for four. Who would we take with us? I've got just the idea. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? ROB (ON PHONE): Jason, it's Rob. Oh, hey. What's up? Calling to concede? [LAUGHING] Hardly. Listen. Man, the strangest thing just happened. I just got four tickets to an all expenses paid weekend at an exclusive erotic hotel. Really? A free weekend at an exclusive resort? Ooh. Yeah. Actually, Laura and I were wondering if you and Elena wanted to join us? Well, I don't know what to say. Well, I was kind of hoping your newlywed ways would rub off on us. Well, when is it? ROB (ON PHONE): It's this weekend. This weekend? Don't you have to work? You know, the bonus deadline's next week? Yeah, yeah. Right. Uh-- you know, I'll just have to bring it with me. No reason I can't work poolside. Well, that sounds great. Sweet. I'll email you the details. Great. Can't wait. What was that all about? A free weekend getaway? Sounds dreamy. It's better than that. With all the distractions of an erotic resort, it'll be no problem getting my hands on Rob's laptop. His laptop? I'm gonna get that bonus for you, baby. Even if I have to steal Rob's work. [WATERFALL SPLASHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Wow, what a place, huh? It's nice. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Atomic Hotel Erotica, where all of your fantasies come true. Great. Oh, Rob. My name is Wilfred. Now, if you will follow me out to the pool and meet our other guests, as well as your benefactor, Mr. Grismer. Oh, sir. You may leave all your luggage here. I will be sure to see that it makes it to your room. Oh, no can do, Willie. This thing stays with me. What's the matter, Rob? Can't leave work behind even for a few minutes? Oh, that's the difference between you and me, Jason. I'm always thinking ahead. Yeah, I guess you're right. Here come our other guests. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Very good. Now that you have all arrived, please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Grismer, and this is my Atomic Hotel Erotica. [APPLAUSE] You've all been invited to spend a magical weekend which will change your lives. You are free to use any of the facilities of the resort-- the spa, the pool, the tennis courts. They're all at your disposal, any time, for your pleasure. That sounds right nice. Yeah. Your rooms have been especially prepared for each of you. They reflect a simpler time. When the troubles of the world were not as grim. When your imagination could run wild. When inhibition was a four-letter word. There are no rules here. Nothing is off limits. There can be no activity that is too extreme. I guarantee you will never regret your time here. And now, if you will join me. I welcome you to the Atomic Hotel Erotica. Hey. Cheers. Now, please, take the time to get to know one another. And when you are ready, Wilfred will show you to your rooms. [APPLAUSE] Hell, I ain't shy, folks. Howdy. I'm Vince, and this here's-- Susan. Hey, y'all. Hi, I'm Jason. This is my wife, Elena. Well, I'm Rob. And I'm Laura. Rob and I work together. He invited us along. So how do you happen to be here? It's the darndest thing. I was out working the back 40. And when I come up to the bunkhouse, there's this is bright, shiny envelope, and it had two tickets to this here fancy place. Same thing happened to me. I mean, without the back 40 and the bunkhouse thing, of course. So, Susan, are you two married? Married? Get out of here. No, no. Heck, no, we ain't married. But I knew I needed somebody sophisticated and classy-like to come to this here place, so I went down to the titty bar and-- sor-- sorry, sorry. --to the exotic dance club, and I asked Sacha if she wanted to accompany me. I told you, it's Susan. Oh, right, right. I'm sorry. Susan. And who wouldn't want to come here, right? I mean, look at this place. It is nice. Now, if you're ready, I will be happy to show you to your rooms. Lead the way. Be careful there, buddy. WILFRED: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Now, if I may take you to your rooms one at a time. What's with all the pictures? WILFRED: Oh, those are past guests of the hotel. People who stay here often want a commemorative photo taken, and many of the people allow us to display it. They sure don't seem too happy. Oh, I assure you, ma'am. We have never had a guest complain. Susan, don't you go insulting our host now, OK? Sorry. Oh, it's quite all right, ma'am. Now, sir, if you and your wife will follow me. You know, she has a point. They do look kind of strange. Stop worrying so much about some old photos and start thinking about how you're gonna get access to Rob's laptop without him knowing. Oh. Don't worry, darling. I've already got a plan. [JUKEBOX MUSIC] And this is the Poodle Skirt Room. Check this out, honey. Yeah, great. Retroville, circa 1954. Why don't I get my bobby socks on, honey, and you can take me to the drive-in for a chocolate soda? Come on. Get in the spirit of things. Well, if you would prefer another room? Nah. I'm sure they're all just as dorky as this one. Well, thank you, Wilfred. Oh, no, sir. This is an all-inclusive weekend. Tipping is not allowed. But I assure you, I will be well compensated for your visit. Oh, OK. Well, thank you. Thank you, sir. Really? [COUNTRY MUSIC] Whoa. Gosh. I ain't never seen no place this fancy before. I'll say. WILFRED: Oh, I'm so glad you like it. This room is one of my personal favorites. There's nothing like a night under the stars to put you in the mood to blast off, if you know what I mean? Sure do. Listen, Vince, honey. I need to use the little girl's room. Oh, right through there, then. Thanks, babe. Try not to plug it up. Would you like me to help you unpack, sir? Gosh, I ain't never been in a place so nice. Yeah, you bet. Oh, I'm sure you will enjoy it. You know, I used to want to be an astronaut when I was a kid. Is that so, sir? Yeah. It didn't work out on account I was afraid of heights. I see. Well, if you won't be needing me anymore, I have other things I need to attend to. You bet. Is he gone? You bet. You wanna break this room in proper? Fly me to the man, baby. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Hey, guys. Wow. Look at this room. Yeah. Fun, huh? So what's your room like? It's called the Main Street Room. It looks like Eisenhower threw up all over it. I'm surprised there aren't two twin beds in there. I mean, I guess it kind of goes with the retro feel of the place. Yeah. But we were thinking it's time for a little fun. Anyone up for a foursome of tennis? Ooh, no can do. I've got lots of work to do. I figured I'd head on down to the pool, sip a margarita, and imagine what I'm gonna do with that bonus check. Yeah, of course. Well, I would love to play some tennis. Great. Listen. It looks like I might be the third wheel here, so why don't you two just run on ahead? Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. I gotta work on my tan anyway. Well, all right, then. Get into your tennis things, and I'll see you down there. Sure thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] Wilfred, did you get the items? Only from the couple in the Sci-Fi Room. There hasn't been an opportunity for the others just yet. Yes. Yes. Excellent. Excellent. This will do just fine. But you must hurry and get the other items. You know you can count on me, sir. Excellent. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh, wow. You're quite good. Thanks. I got a lot of time to practice. All right. I don't think my pride can take losing another game. You and Rob play a lot? Uh. Are you kidding me? I mean, I can barely get Rob out of the house. He's always working. Then he comes home and he works some more. And-- and on the weekends, it's either more work or he's too tired to do anything. And I mean, anything. Oh. Sorry. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I still love him. It's just, he's so goddamn boring. He never wants to go out. Always tired. Just, never any fun, you know? Do you and Elena ever have fun? Oh, yeah. Oh, I'll bet. Yeah, but we keep it fun, you know? We like to experiment, try new things. Really? Sure. Why do you think we agreed to come here? This place is like a high-end swingers club, right? Yeah, I guess so. So listen. Rob may be great for stability and all, but isn't it time you had a little excitement in your life? Rob will be working for hours. And Elena's tan can take an awfully long time. What do you say to a little fling with the tennis pro? Or a tennis non-pro. ELENA: Oh, hey, Rob. Hi. What's that you're drinking? Hm? It's a Mai Tai. It looks incredible. It's-- it's good, actually. Here. You can have it. Drink's not the only thing I want. Thanks. Um, you're-- you're welcome. [SIGHS] It must be some awfully important work you got there. It is. We're trying to streamline the search engine. And what I've done here-- it's, um-- it's actually very complicated. I'm sure. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [LAUGHING] Are you sure about this? Time to rock around my clock, baby. [MOANING] So I heard that you and Laura were having some problems. [SIGHS] Jason told you? Yeah, but, um-- I thought maybe I could help. Well, actually, I could really use the advice. I'd love to help, but first you have to put lotion up my back. Sure. [MUSIC PLAYING] A woman needs some excitement. I mean, I understand that. It's just I-- I've worked so, so hard for her. That's great. But, you know, sometimes it's just not enough. Lower please. I know what you need, Rob. I think I can teach you things that will blow her mind. Well, I can't wait to learn. But wait. Not here. Come on, let's go. ROB: Wait. Wait. Wait, here? Absolutely. But-- You said you wanted some excitement in your sex life, right? But what if we get caught? Well, that's the exciting part. The danger. The anticipation. But-- Oh, shut up and take off your pants. [MOANING] BOTH: [MOANING] [EERIE MUSIC] That is just super creepy. [SCREAMING] What's wrong, honey bun? Stop unpacking. We're leaving right now. What? What are you talking about? It's those pictures, Vince. The ones in the lobby. They're-- they're alive or something. Don't be silly. Those pictures aren't alive. I am not being silly, and I refuse to stay a single night in this place. There's got to be some kind of explanation, OK? You're just plum tuckered out from the trip. Vince, now you listen to me, and you listen to me very carefully. If you ever want to put your hands on these again, then we are leaving now! [SIGHS] Well, we should put these bags in the car. We can be on the road right quick. But I really don't understand. You've only just arrived. I'm sorry, Mr. Grismer. But once Susan's made up her mind, that's pretty much it. But what could possibly be the problem? It's those pictures on the wall. They're alive. Pictures? Alive? I'm sorry. She's kind of got a nervous condition, kind of like a heifer in heat. Heifer? I'm sorry, sweet cheeks. You know what I mean, baby doll. I'm terribly sorry to hear that you have not been happy in your short time with us. [BELL RINGS] You rang, sir? Wilfred. It seems that Susan and Vince have chosen to leave us. So soon? Oh, my. I do hope it's nothing that I've done. It's those pictures, those crazy-ass pictures. Oh, I see. Perhaps if I had Wilfred take you to the Photo Room to see how the portraits are made, that would alleviate your fears. Oh, I don't know about that. Please. A complimentary photograph is included with your stay. And I certainly would like you to have something nice to remember us by. No freaking way. Everything will be fine, my dear. Take the photo. You won't regret it. I won't regret it? That's my girl. Wilfred, will you take the lady and her gentleman friend to the Photo Room and show them how we commemorate our guests? Yes, sir. Right this way, folks. Susan? You won't regret it. [LAUGHING] Right this way. VINCE: See, honey? It's not so bad. What? Just smile, darling. Smile. Excellent. We hope you've enjoyed your stay. [SHUTTER CLICKS] [EERIE MUSIC] We've certainly enjoyed having you. GRISMER: Dinner will be served very shortly. Where are your better halves? Did you get enough sun, honey? Oh, yes. I got everything I needed. Great. Yeah, the sun. It was-- it was very bright and moist. I mean, warm, um-- warm and bright. Yellow. So tennis. How's was the tennis? Tennis? Oh-- Right. Uh, tennis? Tennis was great. Your wife has quite the backhand. She taught me quite a bit. Jason, you're too modest. If you would just learn to follow through on your backswing, your game would improve (WHISPERING) tremendously. Thanks. I-- wait, what? Where's Vince and Susan? Oh, they had to leave suddenly. And now, if you'll all join me in a glass of wine to celebrate the first day of what will be a most exciting weekend. Anymore exciting and we may not survive. Thank you, Wilfred. I think that since all of our guests are now here, I won't be needing you for a while. You understand? Yes, sir. I think you'll find this a very excellent vintage. It's from my own cellar. A light taste for the ladies, and yet robust enough for the men. A toast. Yes, a toast. To a faster search engine and a great big bonus. [LAUGHS] There you go talking about working again. Oh, listen. It's been a long trip up here, and I really have the biggest headache. So I think I'm just gonna go lay down. Tennis too much for you, huh? Hardly. If you'll excuse me. I think I just need some rest. Should I join you? Oh, no, sweetheart. You stay here and enjoy. Oh, no. It would be such a shame for you to miss the evening meal. It's quite special. Oh, I'm sure it is. But I really just don't have much of an appetite. Oh, but, Miss-- I'm sorry, Mr. Grismer, but I'm sure you'll all be just fine without me. Very well. Excuse me. Just so you know, my follow-through was perfect. LAURA: What the hell are you doing? Oh, Miss Laura. I am so sorry. What the hell's going on? Are you sniffing my panties? Yes. Do you find that stimulating, smelling my panties? Yes. Does that excite you? Yes. Well then come here. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Oh, yeah. I'll trust that you won't say anything to my husband about this. Oh, no, ma'am. Good. Because as exciting and dangerous as this was, I do love my husband. You know that, right? But of course, ma'am. Good. I just don't want any misunderstanding. Now, you better get out of here before he comes back. Yes, ma'am. [MUSIC PLAYING] Did he just take my panties? [LAUGHING] So tell me, Mr. Grismer. How long have you worked here? Oh, I don't work here, sir. I own this place. BOTH: Oh? GRISMER: Yes. And my father before me. In fact, this land has been in my family for more than six generations. Has it always been a resort? Oh, no, no. It is said that the land that this building is built upon was once the home of a cult of devil worshippers. Really? Oh, yes. My great-great-grandfather led the villagers in driving the evil spirits out. And since then, this place is said to have magical properties. Magic, really? Well, who can say? But I can tell you that I have seen many people pass through those doors over the past decades. And I can say emphatically, and without fear of contradiction, that no guest has ever left with their problems in tact. Well, a toast to a future with no problems, then. Hear, hear. Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me. I have to use the ladies' room. Certainly. It's right past the front lounge. Thank you. So, Rob, how close are you to perfecting that algorithm of yours? Hm. Actually, I solved it today while at the pool. So when we get back on Monday, that bonus is as good as mine. Well, congratulations. BOTH: Oh. Excuse me, ma'am. Oh, Wilfred. Is that my hair clip? Uh, no. Well, I mean, it's, um-- It is. Were you in my room? Well, I, um-- Give me that. Do you know what they do to thiefs like you where I come from? No, ma'am. Well, if they are extremely attractive, exciting, powerfully built hunks like you, they might do something like this. Uh, ma'am? Oh. I've wanted you ever since I walked in that door. I've seen you staring at me. I know you want me. Now you can have more than just my hair clip. Oh, no. Not again. [MUSIC PLAYING] Did you get the final items? Yes, sir. But it wasn't easy. [GRUNTS] GRISMER: Oh, yes. Yes. Excellent. [LAUGHS] Ahh. With these, we will be able to complete our collection of souls. [LAUGHING] Here it is. Easy as pie. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Listen, we gotta get out of here. What are you talking about? No, you don't understand. This place is like a house of horrors. What? Remember those devil worshippers that Grismer was talking about earlier? Yeah, so? Well, I don't think they've ever left. They want to steal our souls. Are you serious? Deadly. Well, what do we do? We get the hell out of here, that's what we do. What about Rob and Laura? We got what we came for. Best to let them fend for themselves. Come on. We gotta get out of here, now. What are you talking about? It's the people here. They'll steal your souls. What? It's true. They get a hold of some personal object of yours and then, hocus pocus, alakazam, your soul is theirs. You're crazy. [SCOFFS] We'll see about that. Out the back way, Elena. Come on. [SIGHS] [GASPS] My panties. Come on. Hurry. Let's go! Hey, Laura, have you see my comb? You're missing your comb? Yeah, I'm sure I brought it. Rob, I gotta tell you something. Uh, honey. First, I just want you to know, when we get home, I'm putting in for my vacation. Really? A vacation? We haven't taken a vacation in years. ROB: I know. Listen. I know I've been a bit boring and inattentive. Well-- No, it's true and, you know, I work hard, but I do it to provide for you. And I appreciate that. I know, but I also know you need more than that. You need a bit of excitement in your life. And if you'll let me, maybe I can start some of that excitement right now. LAURA: Oh, Rob. Actually. You said you wanted to tell me something? After. After. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [GIGGLING] Is there a problem? Oh, no. We just wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye? Surely you're not leaving also? I hope that there's been no problem. Quite the opposite. Actually, your hotel has worked all too well. You see, we just don't need your services anymore. Well, I am certainly glad that you're happy, but wouldn't you like to stay the weekend? Enjoy all the amenities that the resort has to offer? No, I'm sorry. We need to get back so we can start the real vacation. But honestly, we can't thank you enough. Yes, well, one moment, please. [BELL RINGS] Yes, sir? Wilfred, Rob and Laura will be checking out. Surely you'll be wanting your complimentary photograph as a memento of your stay here? Sure. Why not? Sounds good. Good. Right this way. Just step right up here, sir. OK. Can we, um, just hurry? We are in kind of a bit of a rush. A rush? To get started with the rest of our lives. Oh, Rob. I assure you, dear sir, you have all the time in the world. But wait. Yes, my dear? What is it, darling? Um-- well, don't you think that we should get a photo with our hosts? I mean, after all, they are the ones that brought us together. ROB: That's a great idea. Oh, I don't know. Oh, what could be the harm, Wilfred? LAURA: Oh. Thank you. All right. Now, say cheese. Yeah. Say cheese. Oh! No! [SHUTTER CLICKS] [EERIE MUSIC] So how does it feel to own the Atomic Hotel Erotica? Oh, Rob. [JUKEBOX MUSIC] Do you and Elena ever had fun? What was that all about? A free weekend getaway? Sounds dreamy. If you ever want to put your hands on these. Laura and I haven't had sex for six months. I'm gonna get that bonus for you, baby. Even if I have to steal Rob's work. You know, I used to want to be an astronaut when I was a kid. Oh, no. Not again. You won't regret it. [JUKEBOX MUSIC]
