(sirens wailing) (heart beats) - [Voiceover] Hey Lonnie. It's been a few months since I wrote you last. I hope everything's going good. (upbeat music) Even though I'm still doing grunt work for the record label, I feel like I'm that much closer to fulfilling my dreams of becoming a producer. I even sit in on sessions, now. Here's the latest on Amera. Her EP is dropping real soon and it is hot! And just in case you were wondering, her and Gabe are still together. Four months and going strong, heh. Whoo, Greg, Greg, Greg. Since he's been out of a job, he has preoccupied his time with dating a guy named Reggie, really nice guy, and Amera's cousin Tammy, who's a sweetheart as well. Neither one knows about the other, including Amera. I hope this doesn't blow up in his face. In terms of Jay, we steer clear from one another. I know that's for the best. Other than that, everything is still the same. I know you're crazy busy as always, and I did get your text message. I'm happy for you that you're seeing someone. I hope these letters I've been sending you aren't annoying. I just want you to know, I miss hearing from you. Hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Faybien. - So, he met someone. - So, after months and months with you writing letters with no response, he tells you he met someone? You must feel like shit. - I told you, I told you, I told you. You slow, you blow. Now he's moved the fuck on because you never told him how you felt. - Oh, well. - Oh, well? Excuse me? Oh-- Have we just just met? You've been talking about getting with this dude for the last year, and now it's "Oh, well"? - I mean what can I do, Greg? And maybe it's for the best. Like Amera always says, "Move on, Martha, move on." - I concur. Don't want nobody that don't want you. - Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. - That's bullshit, and you know it. - Hey, can I get two smoothies and one iced tea? Thank you. So, why does it have to be bullshit, Greg? - Because you liked that dude. You just now realizing how much now the possibility of not being with him is real. Haven't you wasted enough time, man? Well, what can I do? He has a man. - Fuck his man, and go get yours. - Nuh uh. I am no co-signing on that one. Seeing how I'm in a loving and beautiful relationship with my lil muscle man. - Yeah, how is the slick talker? - Shut up. - He's fine. - He is fine. - Baby, as for you I can say that's the worst piece of advice you can give that boy. You just be true to yourself and respect that man's relationship. (buzzer noise) - Wrong. - What if Lonnie doesn't even feel the same way for Faybien anymore? Hello, it has been a year. - Open up your eyes. Lonnie loves that boy, and he knows it. - Go ahead, take the advice of a man juggling two relationships. - They're not relationships! - Well, why don't you tell them that! And why won't you tell me who this girl is? - Because it's none of your business. - That poor girl. She must be dumb, deaf, and blind to miss how janky you are. - I guess the only way I'm gonna find out how Lonnie really feels about me is to ask him. - Exactly. - I'm gonna call him up, and ask him out. I've wasted enough time. If he rejects me, I'll hold my head up high, and move on, Martha, move on. - Whatever the outcome, just make sure you get one last fuck up on in there. And you'll be good. - Hey Beatrice. - Hello. (cell phone rings) - Ooh, well, I gotta take this. It's always a pleasure speaking to you. Hello? - Hey Faybien. - Lonnie! Great to finally hear your voice. - Yeah, yours too. - Are you in town? - Yeah, I got in really late last night. - So, I guess if you were a workaholic before, I haven't seen nothing yet. - Yeah, it's been crazy lately. - [Faybien] Do you have any time for us to hang out? - Um, sure. - So, how about when I get out of work? Five o'clock? - Why don't meet at this coffee shop, it's on Cole Street. (pants) - Just like old times. - Yup, me waiting for you to get to me. - I got in under five minutes, though. - Five minutes, heh. Hey. You alright? - Yeah. Oh, you want anything? My treat. - Your treat, hm? Another cup of coffee. - Cool. - Hey, what's up, get in here. - Hello. - So, how's your week been? - Tired. How was your weekend? - Pretty uneventful. (girl moaning) - All I did was study, and I went to the gym and stuff. - Well, you know, all work and no play makes Reggie a dull boy. Even though I shouldn't talk right now, seeing as I don't even have a job. - Exactly. I'm pretty mad, don't forget. I've barely had time to think. - Well, just think of me as Dr. Fix It. - Dr. Fix It? - Yeah, my tongue is gonna find out where all your sore spots are. - Oh, boy. Oh, boy. (laughing) - Hey ya'll, just passing through, don't mind me. - Yeah, man, you know what? Just make sure the rent passes through my hands by Friday. - Well don't worry, I got you. I got you. How you doing Reggie? - Hey Jay, how are you? - Oh, I'm alright, trying to make it through. - [Gabe] Yeah. - Well, nice talking with ya'll. - Bye. I just don't trust him. - So, why do you still room with him? - We're in a recession, hello. - What up, bae? - Hey, Omar. - What's going on, how you doing, you aight? - Well. - Let me guess, you need some more bread, don't you? - Yeah I do. - Yo, what you been doing with the money I been giving you? You be running through that shit kinda fast. - Omar, you know I gotta keep all that stuff tied in my apartment. - I told you, you don't gotta stay with that nigga no more. I got you. - I know. - Here. Better not be fucking playing me neither. - C'mon, you know I'd never play you. - So, I'm your only one? - You're my only one. - Aight. I'ma hit you up later. Better fucking answer the phone when I call, too. - Omar, I will. I know that's right. - [Lonnie] So what was up with all those letters? - It was my only way of reaching out to you. - But why not e-mail? - No one writes letters anymore. I mean, all I ever get in the mail are bills. I just wanted what I said to you to be a bit more personal. Guess it was kind of corny. - Yes, very corny. (cell phone rings) - Ugh, what now? I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to take this. Hello? Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, I'll be there. Yes, I'll be there. Okay, bye. Hey, I'm gonna have to cut this short. Apparently I'm still needed in the office. I'm supposed to be on short leave. Man, this is crazy. I'm sorry I gotta do this. - It's okay. - Please, don't give me that look. - I really do understand. - I'm sorry, I'm just a little on edge. - Kind of noticed. Is everything alright? - No. Just work drama. Nothing you'll be interested in. - I'm interested in anything you have to say, Lonnie. I mean, besides after all the times I went on and on about my own drama-- - See, that's the thing, you never did though. You just shut me out. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go. - Can I take you out to dinner? No, when you have time. Before you leave. I mean, we didn't really even have a chance to catch up. And, you didn't really have a chance to tell me about your boyfriend. - Okay, okay. How about Thursday night? - Perfect. - Cool. I'll see you then. Alright, I'll see you later. - But what was his overall energy? - He just seemed a little nervous, and touchy. I don't know, it just seemed like he had a lot on his mind. - I'm gonna have to bring Gabe into this one. I'ma put you on speaker phone, okay? Hey, muscles. - Huh? - What does it usually mean when you guys start acting flaky? You know, being dismissive, and answering a question with a question. - I don't know. Could mean, he just don't wanna talk. - Wait, why am I asking another man a question I can answer myself? Thanks Amera, bye. - Again, it could be just mean he got something on his mind. - Well, if he has something on his mind, why doesn't he just express that instead of keeping it bottled in? - Cause, we don't always wanna talk about it. - But, if you're in a relationship, you should want to talk about it. - So, you really think I should tell you everything that's on my mind? - Yes. - Some things aren't meant for the partner to know. - Like what? - Well, I mean like, if you and I just got finished arguing, you may not want to know how I feel about you at that very second. - Well, how would you feel about me? - I don't know, we've never got into an argument. - Well, for argument's sake, how would you feel? - I don't know, I'm not in that space. - Well, try. - No. You're crazy. - Well, I'm just saying, I think it's better to express how you feel than keeping everything bottled in. There's nothing worse than a cat and mouse. - What's that mean? - I'm just saying. - [Reggie] Can I ask you a question? - Shoot. - Have you ever thought about us being more than just casual? - In what way? - Like, the two of us being in a committed relationship. - Where's this coming from? - My brain. (laughs) Look, don't get all uptight, you know. I'm just bringing the subject up. - You know, the thing I like about you is that you have your own life, your own career, and your own set of friends. - Of course. - And that you accept that I'm bisexual. You know I'm not into the whole committed relationship thing, so, you tell me. How do you think a relationship would work between us? Hmm? - I don't know. I don't know. And I guess that's why I'm talking about it. C'mon, I know you're not the committed type. I know what I got myself into. But things change. And can you at least admit that things are a lot different between us now than when we first met? - I'm cooking for us, for God's sakes. - Thank you. I should feel so honored, thank you. - You should feel something. Let me tell you something about me. I like my freedom. I like to feel like I can do whatever I want, whenever I want to. - But, you have your freedom, Gabe. I don't get it. - Yeah, but relationships make me feel tied down. See, I like what we got going. We give each other space on the weekends, we see each other when we want to. Not because we feel like we have to. Is that not enough for you anymore, babe? - It's fine. It's fine. (jazz music) - Look who's on time. - Very good, very good. - You look nice. - Thank you, so do you. - So, is there going to be any emergency work related calls coming in? - Look, I didn't even bring my phone with me this time. - That must have been hard for you. - Like pulling teeth. - [Jay] Does he have to be here? - [Omar] I don't even know why you like him like that. You know this his crib. - Okay. - Man, you need to get your girl Tasha out of her crib, man. I'm tryna eat. - So, what's up? - Hah, what's up, what's up. Who's Tasha? - That's just my baby mama, man. Who's Neil? - What do you mean who's Neil? C'mon now. Talk about who's Neil. - Yeah, aight. Chill, Jay, chill. Let's just watch TV. We never really get to hang out. - Ugh. Let's hang out. - So, what's his name? - Who? - Your boyfriend. - I didn't say I have a boyfriend. I said I'm seeing someone. Are you seeing someone? - There was this one guy, but he was a tough act to follow. I'm really sorry about the way everything ended with us. I was going through a lot, and it was getting to me. And, um.. My father and I just weren't really getting along. - And now? - Nothing's changed. I mean, he's not gonna change. But I've changed, a little. I've been reading these books that teach me how to deal with situations more tactfully, and not internalize everything. - Did they teach you how to let people in? How to let people help you, when they want to help? I can understand where your father's coming from. - Can you really? I mean, you never met your father, and your mother supported you when you came out. - So, what, I didn't even know my father. But I'm still a man, Faybien. But you know what though? It doesn't even matter now. It's all in the past. - So, you never finished telling me about this guy in your life. - I'm sorry, I just have a lot on my mind. I'm moving around from state to state, I don't even feel like I have a home anymore. This is just wearing on me. - I just feel like you're mad at me or something. - This isn't about you. - Um, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Okay, I'm back. - So, look, after we're done here, I'm gonna head back to the hotel. I'm not good company right now. I don't think this was a good idea. - Can I tell you about this book I've been reading? It's called, The Truth Is You. - Gotta love those self help books. - Don't make fun. It's been helping. No pun intended. Basically, it talks about self acceptance and discovery. But the most important message is truth. Truth is a hard pill to swallow. You wanna hear my truth? - What's your truth, Faybien? - If you weren't seeing someone else, I'd probably kiss you, right here, right now. - You, kiss me, in public? I doubt it. - Try me. - You want me to dare you. - Shoo, you could double dare me. - Well, then I double dare you. Mmm. - I told you so. - So suppose you and I took a break and you saw me with another man. How hard would you fight to win me back? - A break? - Like, we had a little rough patch, and we had to take a break. - Why wouldn't we just break up? - Because that's not the scenario. - Okay, can you repeat the question? - How hard would you fight to win me back from this other man? - That doesn't sound like me. - Why doesn't sound like you? - Fighting to win somebody back. - Why doesn't it sound like something you would do? - Because, if that rough patch is so rough that we needed to take a break, why not just break up? - What's your take on cheating? - Which one? - There's only one form I know of. - There's two. I mean, there's physically cheating on someone and then there's mental. I think the mental's worse. - Oh really? - Yeah. I mean, the physical can be just that, but the mental is deeper. There's this whole connection that can't be touched by anybody. I wrote a paper about it back in my college days. - Fascinating. - I lied to you back at the restaurant. Wanting to kiss you wasn't my truth. I need to tell you something, Lonnie. - What? - I'm in love with you. That's my truth. I'm in love with you, and I couldn't let you leave here without me telling you that. - Faybien. - I know there's someone else now, and I'm really not trying to get in between that, but we kissed, I felt something, that spark. Remember the spark? I really felt it. Can you tell me you didn't? - Fabe, I just can't do this. - You called me Fabe! I've been wanting to hear you call me that all night. - Okay, okay, so now what? We can't just pick up from where we left off. So much time has passed. So many things are different now. I don't even know what you want from me. - I want you to just kiss me. (romantic music) Just kiss me. ♫ I breathe anew inside of you ♫ Emotions flow ♫ I see the truth ♫ We dance to the rhythms of this mystic drum ♫ I've searched the whole world for you ♫ Through time and space I found you ♫ I want to make a brand new life baby right by your side ♫ Now I know that I want you ♫ Oooh ♫ - [Faybien] This feels good. - [Lonnie] Yeah, it does. - Should we be doing this? - Probably not. - But it feels so right. You and I together feels right. But you're seeing someone else. - Yeah. - Would you look at me differently if I told you I don't care? I love you, Lonnie. Say something, please. - You should get dressed. - What? Lonnie, why are you acting like that? I want to know how you feel. - This was a mistake. - Lonnie. Look at me. I'm not afraid anymore. I know, the way things ended before wasn't fair and I'm really sorry about that. - You apologized already. - I feel like I need to again. - No, you don't. Look, Faybien, we got caught up in the moment. - This was more than getting caught up in the moment. Didn't you hear me? I love you. Look at me. I love you, Lonnie. Do you love me? - Stop. I gave you all of me. And you broke my heart. How do I know you're not gonna do that again? How do I know? How do you expect me to feel a year later? I mean, did you honestly think all the letters you sent me was gonna fix what you did? I care about you so much. But this was a mistake. It shouldn't have happened. I'm with someone else now. - Your actions tell me that you're with me. - Then let me clear things up then. This was a mistake, and I'm with someone else now. - Do you love me? - No. (somber music) ♫ Don't like you ♫ No, don't like you ♫ I hate you ♫ I hate you ♫ - Greg ain't here. - I know, he should be home any minute. - And? - And he said it's okay if I come and wait for him. I won't get in your way. - Child, just you being here is in my way. - Well, get over it. - Hell, somebody's got a lil bit too much don't we? - Not now, Jay. - Oh, let me guess why you here. You want to cry on Greg's shoulder about the latest drama in your life. - Shut up! - Sweetie, I live here. (yells) - Chill! - Get the fuck off me! - Greg, you better get your girl cause I'm not the one! - Faybien! - Get him out of here! - Bitch, I live here! - Not for long if you don't tell me what's going on. - Oh this is some bullshit, Greg, you got one too many sides to be fucking threatening me. - Everybody, calm down. - Greg, just, go see Faybien please. - Just a second. Try me man, please try me, push me, and you'll see how I get down. - Greg, go. Jay, Jay. I like you and all, but you gotta watch it with Greg. - Oh no, sweetie, you gotta watch it with Greg. And don't get too caught up. This is some fuckin' bullshit. (sobbing) - I slept with Lonnie. - That's a good thing, right? - I told him I loved him, and I asked him if he loved me, he said no. Greg, he was so cold. - Look, I'm telling you, he's not over it. - What should I do? (somber music) - Thank you. - So do you think she's gonna be supportive, or judgmental. - [Greg] Don't tell her. - But I used both your advice. - Here she comes. - So, I have something to tell you. - He's cheating on me! - What? - He's cheating on me! Yes, yes, uh huh. He must think I'm some slow ass country bumpkin who can't decipher the meanings! - Hold on, you're spinning. - Hi, may I take your order? - Tequila, and keep it coming. - You sure you wanna tell her? - So he's trying to give me some mumbo jumbo bull about how they's two ways to cheating on someone. One of them being mental, and the other one being physical. But the mental is worse than the physical, AKA I'm physically cheating on your ass, but you shouldn't feel any kind of way about it because I'm not mentally fucking her! - Don't you think you're jumping to conclusions? - I'm gonna wait til I see him with another woman, or a man. Oh, Lord, please don't let it be another man. (laughing) No offense. - Gabe isn't gay. - Oh, hun, I know that! I'm Inspector Faggot. I'm just gonna have to follow him and that will be that. I feel so much better now that I have a plan. So, what was it that you wanted to tell me? - I could tell you about it later. - No, I'm not gonna let that slick ass motherfucker stop me from being a friend. What's up? - I, um.. - He fucked Lonnie. - Greg! - You what? - It just kind of happened. - Hey, a pimple on the crack of your ass just kind of happens. You planned this. - How could you do this to me? - What? - To you? Chick, this ain't got shit to do with you. - Knowing what I'm going through right now. - That's why I didn't want to tell you. - So now you're the other man. Is that what you want to be known as? - No. - So you and Lonnie are back together? - He rejected me. - Good. That's what you get. - Why don't you just fuck him up the ass without Vaseline next time? I mean is that the way you show support? - I'm not supporting this. And I told you that before. - Thanks for being a friend, Amera. - You know what? I'm not staying. - Deuces. - I am way too emotional for this, and I don't want to say the wrong thing. You're wrong for this. What makes this any different from what you thought Jay was doing when you first met Lonnie? - Amera! - That was a low blow, sis. - What the fuck ever. - Alright, we have three choices. We can sit, and continue to worry about that fool. You can pick up the phone, call Lonnie, and try to get him back. Or, we can get out of here. - Like, the last choice. - Alright. I got an idea. Woman, get yo ass back here. We're gonna go on a little road trip, alright? Don't worry about it. It's gonna be okay. - Yeah? - Is Omar here? - Who's looking for him? - Just tell him Jay is here. - Okay, well who are you? Cause I've never seen you around here before. - Yeah, and you ain't supposed to. Like I said, tell him I'm here. - Really? Well he ain't home, baby, okay? And what the hell do you want with my man? With that stank ass attitude? - Woah, don't worry about what I want with your man, Tasha. Like I said, tell him I'm here. - Okay, how the fuck do you know my name? What the hell are you doing here? - And your man. - And my man. - Yeah. - What the hell? - What up, bae? - Okay, What up. Who is Jay and why he is over here asking for you? His gay ass motherfucking knocking on my door-- - Just get the fuck in the house. - Get the fuck off me! - Shut up, man! I'm tired of you talking! - [Greg] Now, he didn't say two words all the way down here. Go over there and say something to that boy. - You really don't realize how upset I am. - This isn't about you. He needs both of us, that's why he came to us instead of trying to handle it himself. He's trying to change, Amera. Don't make him regret talking to you. - But he has never been this impulsive. - And I say, good for him. But that's not the point. The man he loves says "I don't love you." Imagine how that must feel. Now I know there's a woman's compassion somewhere in there. Go over there and show him some. Go talk to him. - Aw, come here. - I didn't realize how much I hurt him. And what about the guy he's seeing? How could I do that? - Stop worrying about people that aren't worried about you. Start worrying about yourself. - How do I keep on making mistakes like this? I really have been trying to think more positively. God knows I don't want my father's negativity just rubbing off on me. - You need to get out and meet new people. - What better way to get over somebody. Come on now. - Than to get under someone else. He's so nasty. Why do we hang around him? - Oh, I think I'm going out tonight, you wanna come? - I can't, man. I'm cooking dinner for Reggie tonight. - Okay, I gotta say, I'm impressed. This has got to be the longest I've known you to be in a relationship. - Man, stop putting that label on it! Me and Reggie are.. That's what you get. Me and Reggie are keeping it nice and simple. - What about you and Tammy? Oh, we are keeping it nice and nasty. (laughs) - Greg, you know what it sounds like now, right? It sounds like your relationship is with Reggie, and your sex life is with Tammy. - Next subject. Why don't you call Amera. Take her mind off that concert she got coming up. - Good idea. Oh, you know she's still hounding me about who this woman it is you're dating. - As far as I'm concerned, Tammy won't tell her because she doesn't want her to know. Tammy doesn't want her to know, I'm not gonna tell her. (club music) - Hey sweetie, here's yours. - Thanks hun. - And thanks for coming guys. - Not a problem. As long as you keep your promise and help me get ready for my performance. - You know I will. - Uh huh. - Alright. Gabe, you okay? - Yeah man, it's just weird for me. I mean, all these guys dancing with each other. - None of these men want you. - Uh, no, some of them do. - Not helping. Okay, so listen. Fay and I are gonna head to the ladies' room, and I'll be right back. - Well, why do you guys gotta go together? - Look, it will only take a second. I'll be right back. So I'm this much closer to catching him. - Amera, I thought all that was over. - You crazy. - Two months later and you still don't have any proof. Why don't you just let it go. - Did you peep that? - So what, he looked at another girl. She's a lesbian, for God's sake. - I don't care if Michelle Obama's booty walks by. All eyes should be on me, especially his. - Amer, just-- - You know what, no. I got this. And I'm going to play this as cool as a ninja. - Amera, what were guys doing in there for so long? Baby, what was that? That kinda hurt. - Oh, I'm sorry. Let's go. - What about Faybien? - He'll be okay, c'mon. - What's up with you? - I'm fine, why don't you take care of the tab? - Ya'll leaving? - Yes. Phase one of catch cheating boyfriend in the act in full effect. You coming? - No, I'll just -- - Alright, I'll keep you posted. Boo-yah. Oh hell no. Gabe, Gabe. (grunts) - What's up, babe? - Me, damn it. - Damn, you look sexy. - I know, so what's up. - Baby, I'm tired and I'm drunk. - Don't you dare punk out on me. That little bit couldn't have gotten you! Gabriel. Gabe, baby. Don't you want to make me feel good? Don't you wanna make me feel good? Gabe, make me feel good. Make me feel good. (snores) - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Hey, hey guys, what are you doin'? - Nigga, back the fuck up. - That's my friend. So leave him alone! - I'm about to fuck you up. - What's going on? Hey, what's going on? Break it up! - You alright? - I'm just glad you didn't get hurt. - I'm kinda glad he did. - It was like something out of a bad movie. I mean, I keep on wondering what could have gotten him to that point. - C'mon, man, with him, it could have been anything. - I feel sorry for him. - I never thought I'd hear you say that about Jay. - I mean, God only knows what could have happened to him. - We'd be singing, "Ding dong, the bitch is dead." - Damn. - And since when did you get on the let's hate Jay wagon? - Ever since that high yellow motherfucker started threatening me. - He what? - He's been telling me he's gonna tell the two people I'm seeing that I'm seeing both of them at the same time. I'm like, what? - You know what? I told you that was going to come around and bite you in your big, fat booty. And again, who is this dumb chicken head that's stupid enough to think that you only seeing her? - That was redundant. Dumb and stupid. - Why do you care so much, anyway? I mean, do you wanna sex her? What makes you think she wants to be in some type of monogamous relationship anyway? How do you know she just doesn't like the sex. - Because I don't know any women like that. And like I said, the truth will come out. It always does. - I feel like you guys are abandoning me. - Oh, man, you don't need us. Go out. Mmm, that smells good. You cooking anything? - That must be Tammy. - Oh! Woah! Um, hey Tammy. - Hey Faybien. Hey daddy. - You gots to get up out of here. - Aww, how are you? - Oh, tread carefully. Gred and Tammy are in there and let's just say they have commandeered the kitchen. - Faybien, Faybien. I never got a chance to talk to you. - About what? - You know, just say thank you for the other night. - You're welcome. - Well, since Greg is laid in his apartment with his nasty ass dead baby, do you wanna go get a drink? - Are you serious? You really don't have to. - I mean come on, what else you got to do tonight? - Nothing, really. - Exactly, so let me do this for you. - I don't really drink. - Oh, child, come on, I'll get you some milk and cookies. Let's go. Well, I must admit, you do have some big balls. I mean, I damn sure wouldn't of did that. - Your honesty is touching. - Well look, I'm just saying. You don't like me and I damn sure don't like you. So, I'd be sitting up here lying saying I'd do the same thing. - But you're still a person, Jay. Someone I know. So, even though you wouldn't, I'd do it again, if I had to. (giggles) (cell phone rings) - Hello? - Hey cuz, what's goin' on. - I'm in the middle of something, actually. - I just wanted to make sure we're still on for tomorrow. - Grasshopper, I'm a comin' for you. - Who was that? - Uh, it's just a friend of mine, playing around. - Tammy, what's going on. - Oh god Amera, let me call you back actually. - Why is everyone being so secretive with me? Tammy? - Bye bye. - Tammy! - Is everything alright? - Something in the milk ain't right. - So, sweetie, why are you always so single? - I could ask you the same question. - Oh, you could ask me the same question, but I got something going on, trust. I just don't bring my dates around the club house. - Anymore. - Baby, why are we speaking about shit we don't know about. - Jay, it was so obvious what you were doing. Probably still doing. - What the fuck do you know? You know, you and your two little prissy ass friends don't know shit about the streets. - We never claimed to. And if you know so much, why are you living with one of my "prissy" friends? - Because I know how to survive. As a matter of fact, I said my thank you, did my good deed for the year, we square. Child, cause you trying it. - Girl, you know this is bananas, right? - You know what's bananas? My cousin's seeing someone and not even telling me. - Amera, get a grip. There's nothing going on behind your back. - Well, I'm listening in on conversations talking about grasshoppers and crickets. - Because, I'm just kicking it with this dude, that's all. - Do I have to remind you about the last time you were just kicking it? - Look, Amera. I am not a baby. I am a grown ass woman, who can handle hers. Now, you need to be more concerned with handling yours. Because you haven't been, now have you? - Did you see her? Did you see her? How could he be with someone who grows their own hair? I can't believe this! (clamor) They're going to the house. They're going to the house! This is his street! - Wait! - Damn it! Okay, okay. I gotcha now, I gotcha now, Gaby baby! - Amera, what are going to do? - We aren't getting out of the car, we gonna wait. We're gonna watch. We'll watch. We'll watch. Better not open that door for her! Well, how does she know where she's going? Look, she's hitting him up for it! Tammy, I asked him point blank if he was cheating on me. He said, "No Mer." Are they going inside? Guess who's coming to dinner. - There's people in the first floor? - Yeah. - Okay, let me help you. What do you want me to do? - I need you to.. Okay. Wait, on my hands? - Yeah, okay. - What's going on here, ladies? - Damn. - Oh just, getting in my apartment. - This is Mr. Morris' apartment. - See, he's my boyfriend. And I have the keys right here. Okay, gracias. There they go! - Wait, that was only 15 minutes. Is Gabe a quick shooter? (dance music) - You know what? I think I'ma get a cranberry vodka. What do you want? - The same. - Well, look at you, roll with the big dogs now. - Well you know when to roll man. - Who dis? - That's my roommate's friend. - Faybien. - Cute name, cutie. - Thanks. Wait, haven't I seen you before? - No. But I know all about you. My name is Neil. You'd never guess who's here. Jamal and them. I'm about to get the fuck out of here before they start with you again. - Child, calm your skinny ass down. I knew they was gonna be here tonight. - Aren't those the guys that jumped you the other night? - Yeah, child. - You wanna dance? - With you? - Yeah, why not? I mean, let's show them how we really get down. (dance music) ♫ Let her out ♫ Let her rip ♫ Let the shit hit the fan ♫ Stop pissing round the ceiling ♫ It's getting me dizzy ♫ Let her out ♫ Let her rip ♫ Let the shit hit the fan ♫ - Hey. - What's up? - Are you even gonna say hi to me? - So, we never got a chance to introduce ourselves properly. - Yeah. By the way, I never do that. - Neither do I. - My name's Eli. - Faybien. - Nice to meet you. - You fucking serious? After you fucked up my money, and my reputation? Jay, get the fuck out of my face, yo. - Oh, you know what? You still on that shit. I'ma leave you the fuck alone. I'ma leave you alone real good. - [Eli] Is this your real number? - That's my real one. Use it. - Yeah, try that shit again and you'll get another motherfuckin' bottle served. The fuck I tell you? - Are you crazy? - Trust me, they would have got to me before I got to them. - I get it now. You invited me so I could be your backup. - Look at you, you're actually smarter when you're drunk. - Oh man, what happened? - Get off me and go get him! - I wanna get us a cab. - What about Neil? - Oh, he's not coming. - Oh shit! - Woo! - Yeah! - Good job. (groans) - Rise and shine, sparkle snatch. - Greg, how did I get here? - You came home drunk with Jay last night. - Where are my clothes? - Don't worry, I undressed you. - Come on. - Here, put this under you. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. No need to ask how you're feeling. You okay? - This your first time getting drunk? - No. Remember that time back in college when I went to that party with you? - Oh, yes, you were drunk that night too. Remember, you threw up all over-- - Don't say that or I might throw up now. - My mouth is dry. - That's because you're dehydrated. You want some water? - Yeah. - You want anything Greg? - Nah, babe. - Alright, I'll be right back. - Thanks Reggie. He's such a nice guy. - Yeah. Now back to you. Why were you out with Jay last night? - Well, you and Amer got your own things going on right now, so, he invited me, and I figured, why not. Believe it or not, we had fun. I think. - Really. - Yeah, I remember dancing all night. With different guys. - Say what? - I even kissed one guy. - Excuse me, you did what? - I don't know if it was the liquor or me just feeling myself, but I just went for it. - Man, you went out and had a time like that and I wasn't there? - Mhm. - Shit. - Here you go, Faybien. - Thank you, Reggie. - I'm proud of you man. - That should help you feel better. - Faybien, you really think you should be drinking? I mean, you know, with your one kidney and all. - You make it sound like I'm going on some binge. - Look, I'm just saying. I don't think it's the wisest decision. - You should really be careful with that. - Yeah. - Alright, I gotta go to work, so feel better Faybien. - I'll try. - Bye babe. See you later. - You guys are so cute together. - Yeah, but I think he might be getting bitten by the monogamy bug. - Would that be so bad? Oh, wait a minute, you're trying to have your cake and gobble it too. - Look, I'm just saying. If it's not broke, why get into a relationship with it? - You know what, I feel you. - Say what? - Greg, I'm about to have some fun. Kissing that stranger felt so unlike me, and that's a great thing. (upbeat music) ♫ Hello hello hello ♫ All I do is think about how great I feel ♫ In the inside ♫ The reason I love being me - Hey Beatrice. - You're late. ♫ Is there's only one of me ♫ - I know. Did anyone notice? - You're three hours late, what do you think? - It was a pleasure. - I am high. - Hello? - Why'd you send me to voice mail three times? - Because I'm just getting to the office. I'm running three hours late. - But hun, it's an emergency. - What's wrong? - I need you here at the studio. - When? - Now. - Now? I can't go now. Didn't I just tell you? I'm running late, I can't leave. - I'm shooting the album cover and I don't know how I look. - But I thought Tammy was doing your makeup? - She is. I need a second opinion. - I'm sorry, I can't, I can't leave. - My life is falling apart and you don't even care. Gabe is cheating on me. - You don't know that. - I think I caught him this time. I saw him with another woman. - How do you know that? - I followed him. - Jesus! - And he was in his apartment for 15 minutes, and then decided to come out with her. - How do you know that it wasn't just a friend of his? - Hun, I do not need the dumb blonde right now. Gabe was cheating on me, this EP is about to drop and I'm nervous about that, I'm about to take this photo and I look like a hot mess. Help! - I'm sorry Amera, I can't help. You'll be fine. Bye. - Oh no, the hell he didn't. - Amera, come on. They're ready for you. - Shit. Shit, damn! ♫ Right now ♫ Gotta do it ♫ You better do it ♫ You better work it girl ♫ Work that camera girl ♫ Sexy ♫ Work ♫ Work ♫ Work ♫ You better work ♫ Work the camera ♫ Work the camera ♫ Work the camera ♫ Work the camera ♫ Work the camera ♫ - So, I'm trying to figure something out. - Well, hello to you too. - Yeah, what are you doing? - Oh, damn, what is it now? - You and Faybien. When did you become such good, good Judys? - Oh, that's not a good color on you sweetie. Someone's a little jealous. - Jealous? Nah. I'm worried, for him. He was late again for work today. - Oh, I know he ain't trying to blame that shit on me. - Nah, he would never do that. - Yeah, I thought so. So stop riding me. - When it comes to Fay, I'ma ride you like a fucking mule. - Mmm. - And don't think I don't know that you tried to warn Reggie. Keep trying me, alright? (door bell rings) - Oh, someone's at the door. Wonder who that could be? Tammy, or Reggie? Why don't you go get that. - No, no. - No, no. - That can wait. - Why don't you go get that. - That can wait. - No, no. Go get that. - Shoo, you know what. - Ding dong! - Stay right here, stay right here. (stammers) - What is wrong with you? Are those paperclips? - What is that? - My seamstress was deported! - She sure was. - Greg, I need to borrow your car. - There's something wrong with you. For what? - Cause I need to follow Gabe. - Nuh uh. That's not gonna happen. You ain't fucking up my car like you did Tammy's. - No, no, I'll be real careful, I promise. - Nah, not today. - Wait a minute, how you know I messed up Tammy's car? - Cause she told me. - But you don't even know her. So how would you.. Oh, hell no! Please don't tell me this woman you've been fucking is my cousin! - Oh shit! Yeah, now go get that. Go get that. - Well, now you know. - I'm used to you telling me little stories about these tricks you would fuck in the past but I never thought you would fuck my cousin! We're supposed to be friends here! - What does our friendship have to do with Tammy and I? - You know what? You just keep your indecisive, sexually confused dick away from my cousin! - Oh, well if the kitty cat keeps purring, I'ma keep stroking! - You are disgusting! - Well, you know where the door is, if I'm so disgusting. - Well, you know what? The cat is out of the bag. I'm telling Tammy. And don't even think about coming to my show. - You don't gotta worry about that, baby. If I wanna hear the sounds of cats fucking, I'd go to my backyard. And get them paperclips out of my house! I ain't paying for that shit! Get the hell out of my house, paperclips. - I hope your dick falls off and goes to rehab! (door slams) (slow, easy going music) - You're fired. - So you followed him. Baby girl, baby girl. You know you shouldn't have followed him. There is a padded room, and a straight jacket waiting for that ass somewhere. - Look, you wouldn't even loan me your car. So, I had to resort to desperate measures. - So, did you catch him the act, hood chick? - No. And you know my show is on Sunday. I can't think about anything else. - Then why don't you just ask him, straight up? - Because he denied it. - And you don't believe him why? - Because he's lying. - Hey, come on in! Come on in. - Hey. - Yeah, I'm Gabe, I'm Amera's boyfriend. - Wow, black folks on time. You must be hungry. - Woah. - Well, I'm Jay, Greg's roommate. - I'm Gabe, nice to meet you. - What's up Greg? - Why'd it take you so long to get here? - Work. - It's Saturday. - And I coach the kids' basketball team. Why you acting like you don't know that? - It's alright, man. As long as you made it here. - I ain't gonna lie man, I did bring my appetite, so. - What's up? Working my foot off up in this food. - Okay. - I can vouch for that actually. Hey, I'm with Gabe. Nice to meet you. - Reggie, can you do me a big favor? Can you take Gabe to the dining room? That's where the drinks are. - Alright. - Alright, man. - Thanks for waiting. Come on in. - How you doing? - Oh, I'm fine. But look, Greg's in the dining room and the food's almost ready. - That's crazy. - Faybien, where have you been and why didn't you tell me? - Guys, this is Eli. Eli, these are my two best friends, Amera, and Greg. - Hey, nice to meet you man. - Hi Eli. Would you mind doing me a favor? If you could excuse us for a moment, the dining room is right through that door. Are you fucking him? - Hey, that's none of your business. - Yes, he's fucking him. - Is the food almost ready? Cause niggas out there is getting restless! - Jeez, what's come over him? - Can we do this at another time? I thought we were having dinner. - Child, yes, and we hungry. - Oh, calm down, not everybody's here yet. - Who we waiting on? - Tammy. - You invited Tammy while Reggie's here? (laughs) - Suicide! Oh. Hey girl. Greg, guess who? Go ahead. - Cheers. - Hey, everyone. - Hey Lonnie. - Lonnie. You invited Lonnie? - My bad. I didn't even think you'd come here with anybody. And I definitely didn't think he'd be in town. I just e-mailed him. - Hey Faybien. - Hey Lonnie. - Babe, who's Lonnie? - Faybien's ex. - Ooh, this is gonna be interesting. - You ain't said nothing about a thing. - What's up with that? - What're you talking about Reggie? - Seriously. What's up with this girl? - Alright, um. I have to admit. I had an ulterior motive to having this dinner. - Here we go. - Do you think this is a good idea? - As all of you know, I like to live my life alternatively, but lately, I've been wondering if my choices to live alternatively have not been affecting others in a not so positive way. - What does that mean? - Reggie, this is Tammy. And I've been having sex with Tammy. - Tammy, this is Reggie. And I've been having-- I've been seeing Reggie. - So you mean, you've been fucking us both at the same time? - Excuse me. - This shit is better than Maury. - You know, I can deal with you being bisexual. - You can? - Because you told me up front, and I dibble and dabble with women too. - You do? - I can even deal with you seeing someone else while you were seeing me. - You can? - Because I'm seeing someone else. But Greg, to out the situation in front of everyone is tacky, (finger snaps) tasteless, (finger snaps) and unnecessary. (finger snaps) - But that's my whole point. I'm getting all this out in the open because I don't like hiding anything about myself. I'm confessing it because confession is good for the soul. - Yeah but. I'm sorry, if I may. I think she's saying is that, this is nobody's business. I mean, you didn't have to confess it to anybody. - But you a brother. You just sweep it up under the rug. Being secretive about everything. That shit's your way, right? - I didn't say that, Amera. - I'm gonna go check on Reggie. - I mean, even Faybien knew to keep it to himself. - You knew about this and you didn't tell me? - I'll go check on Reggie. - No, Lonnie, I got it. - I'm talking to you Fay! - No. Who you need to be talking to is your boy here. - Excuse me? - Stop worrying about everybody else. - Wait, what is she talking about? - Child, it's coming together. - You know what, I'll go check on Reggie. - Tammy, what the hell are you thinking? - [Tammy] Mind your business. Oh boy. - [Amera] What do you even know about girls? - [Tammy] Oh, gosh. Sorry mom. - [Amera] Bisexuality. Can you even spell it? - Are you two together? - What are you even doing here, Lonnie? Shouldn't you be at your job and or with your man. - I've been meaning to talk to you Fabe. Don't ever call me that again. - I'm really sorry about how things ended between us. - You mean the way you ended things. - You're right, but we need to talk. - See, that's the funny thing cause, I'm done talking. Confessing and laying it all out on the line. I'm good. For the first time in a long time, I am real good. So you, you can go back to wherever it is the hell you came from! - Fabe, what's wrong with you? Have you been drinking? - This is a dinner party, isn't it? Yeah, I had a drink. And I'm really sick of people asking me that. I'm a grown ass man. - I think you're a little drunk. - Get off of me! Fuck you, Lonnie Wilson! - Oh, I feel like I am watching three different TV shows! - I'm just looking out for you! - Baby, I don't need looking out for. - The hell you don't. You drop a bomb like this and you don't need looking out for. - So what? I sleep with men and women. And so what, I was sleeping with Greg? It really ain't none of your business! - [Amera] I'm your family! - So what, Amera? Stop worrying about me, and worry about your boy here. Cause something ain't right with him. - Okay, what is she talking about? - You cheating on me. - What? - Yeah, nigga. We saw you creeping with your co-worker. - Okay, what are you talking about? - Are you about to sit here and deny that you didn't have Rachel up in your apartment? - Wait a -- You were just following me? - Hell yeah. - [Amera] Stay out of this. - Oh, so it's okay for you to be all up in mine, but not the other way around, huh? - Reggie. He's not opening the door. - Reggie. Come on out. - Greg, if I were you, I would stay away from me right now. - Why would you do this? Look, everyone's fighting. - What are you talking about, man? I was trying to clear the air. I'm tired of these secrets. You really need to come to terms with what you're dealing with. - And what would that be? - Hurt, man. You're still hurt. You and Lonnie need to talk. - Fuck Lonnie. - Fay! - It's okay, Greg, it just wasn't a good idea. - I'm out, Amera. Will you have someone to take you home? - So, we're not even going to talk about this. You're just gonna leave. - There's nothing to talk about. Especially in front of all these people! Alright, you don't trust me to the point that you followed me? - Well, I asked you what was going on. - Oh come on, you don't even know what you're talking about. I saw what I saw with my own eyes! - Stop it, Amera! Alright, stop it, and lower your voice. I am not one of your friends. And when I told you that I didn't cheat on you, I meant it. So, now this subject is deaded - Deaded. Who says-- - I'm saying it! I must have led you to believe that I'm willing to let you run things. You remember how when you wondered how I would feel about you after an argument? I guess you know now. Will you have a ride home? - No. - Then get your stuff and I'll drop you off, and don't say shit to me. - Motherfucking talking to me about don't say shit-- (grunts) - Had to. Just cause. - I deserve that. - Oh, Reggie. I'm so glad you're alright. - Well, you definitely deserve this. (groans) - Just cause. - Oh, man. Thanks guys. Oh, shit. Fuck, man. - You alright? - Shit. That went well. - Alright, you gonna be okay? Cause Neil and I gots to go. - Just go. - I mean I'ma help you clean up tomorrow. - Whatever. - Great party ya'll. - Fay, see you at the club tonight? - Mhm. Eli and I will be there. - Are you seriously gonna leave here without talking to Lonnie? - There's nothing to say. He made his point, and I hope I'm making mine too. - Yeah, you are. Man, you a damn fool when you're drunk. Thanks for the invite, Greg. I'm sorry how things turned out. - So am I. - Deuces! (rock music) ♫ Come come come on ♫ Come come come on ♫ Come come come on ♫ I got what you want ♫ I got what you need ♫ Straight take it from me ♫ Straight take it ♫ - I can't believe this. - Amera, what happened to you? - I bombed, I fucking bombed. Do you know how much it cost me to get this done? - But I thought you rehearsed? - You know why, Faybien. - I mean, he's my boyfriend, he should be in the front row supporting me! - Anything could have happened. - Don't make excuses for that weak ass nigga. - I know what's happening. He's with some skank ass hoe. - You don't know that. - Fay, take the blonde wig off. And why are you always assuming that he's not cheating on me? - Yeah. - I mean, not everyone is as true and blue as you are. Wait a minute. That's not even you anymore. Seeing that you slept with Lonnie knowing that he had a boyfriend. So, if someone like you could do it, what makes you think some low down dirty motherfucker couldn't do it to me? - I'm just trying to be supportive. - Well you're not, you're just being annoying! And not every cloud has a silver lining. - Perhaps he didn't come because you made an ass out of yourself by following him. You know what, Amera? I am sick and tired of you thinking you can say whatever you want to me and get away with it. You'd rather I feed into your negativity like your cousin here. - Wait a minute. - You accuse him of cheating on you without any proof, and then you follow him. You bombed, because you were drinking way too much before the show. That was your doing, not Gabe's. And so what if he cheated on you? What, you put him in front of you? See, the Amera I know would never have done that. - You know what-- - Actually, I do know what. I'm done taking your bullshit. Fuck you, Amera! - What the hell happened? - Hey, boy. How was Amera's performance? - Whatever. I'm sick of them. I'm sick of everything. How could Greg invite Lonnie? How could he do that? What am I wearing? This isn't me, that's Lonnie. - Faybien, a hat, really. Calm down. Matter of fact, take this rum and coke. Breathe, nice. - I've been trying so hard not to fall back into this. Doing so much crying and trying to forget. He hurt me. But I guess that's what I deserve after how I hurt him. - Mmm. Child, drink this. Just drink, drink. There you go. - I lost my job. - Here, drink up. There's nothing you can do about that today, so drink up. Child, let that be tomorrow's problem. - Thank you Jay. I really appreciate it. - Woah, what are you doing? - What? - Why did you kiss me? - Child, that. That wasn't nothing but a little kiss. You know how the French do. I kiss all my friends that way. - Well next time, aim for my cheek. - Okay. - This is my song! You wanna dance? - Nah, I'ma sit this one out, but go ahead. - Okay, okay. I just want to forget him. I just want to have fun, I deserve that. - Yeah, you do. - Are you going to be able to do your second set? - I have to. These people came here to hear me sing. - Are you finished with this coffee? - Yeah, thanks. You know what? Faybien was right. If my five year old self looked at me now, I wouldn't be able to recognize me. - [Tammy] Why do you say that? - Because I would never put anyone ahead of me. And I put a man ahead of me. - Amera, you put him ahead of you. - My daddy? - Yeah, Amera. I mean, he treats you like a princess, but he treats your mom like a -- - Like a little, little mouse. - [Tammy] But maybe Gabe was one of the good guys, Amera. - But you saw him in the apartment. - You don't know that. You just judged him. - [Amera] You think I ran him off? - I don't know. - I look a hot mess. I look like some trashed out, 1980's horror prom queen. Mascara running down my face. Thank God the next song's a ballad. - Come on. Just pour your heart into it. - Hello. Not as many here as there was before. I wanted to apologize for before, ya'll. I was going through something and I lost myself. But it took a really great friend to show me where I am. So Faybien, wherever you are, this is for you. ♫ Why did you do this to me ♫ Why can't I bend For you ♫ Why do I cry when I'm strong ♫ Why would you lie with no reason ♫ La la la ♫ La la la ♫ La la la ♫ La la la ♫ Cause I don't wanna be standing on the stairs ♫ Tell me why ♫ I'll be right there ♫ I'll be right there ♫ I'll be right there ♫ Tell me why ♫ I needed you ♫ I needed you ♫ I needed you ♫ Tell me why ♫ Cause I need to know ♫ Cause I need to know ♫ Cause I need to know ♫ That you're gone ♫ (applause) (somber music) (wheezing) - Do you love me? - No. (ambulance sirens) (heart monitor beeping) - Greg, how did we get here? I can't lose him. - He's gonna be alright. He has to be. He's gonna be alright. - No, but you heard what the doctor said because he only has the one kidney. What if he doesn't wake up? - Nah, nah, nah. He's not going out like that. Look, the Lord is not ready for him yet. He put him on this Earth cause he has to keep us in line, alright? He's gonna be alright. - We really are messes, aren't we? Here I'm chasing after another man. - And I'm greedy. I want it all with no consequences. He tried to tell me as much but I didn't listen. - You know he told me, you know I didn't lisen. - I admire him. I really do, I mean. He's the only one of us that has issues and is willing to deal with them out in the open. He's not trying to hide them, he's trying to fix them. - And here we are thinking we have it all together. I just don't understand. - You people are sick. - We're his friends Mr. Allen. - Friends wouldn't give my son drugs. - You know we wouldn't hurt him. We love him. - Just get out. - We're not going anywhere. We're about as much as his family as you are. - Okay, I'll just call security to escort you out. - No, Mr. Allen, you know me. You know I wouldn't hurt Faybien. - If you're so called friends, how is it that all he does now is stay out late? He never comes home at all! How is it that he started drinking so much? How is it that he lost his job? And now he's taking drugs! That's how you look after your friend. - You know what, it's so amazing that you care so much about your son now. Wasn't it not too long ago that you wanted to kick him out of your house cause he was gay? - Boy, who the hell do you think you're talking to? - This is not helping! - Hey, Fabe. - Come on, come on man. All your stuff is right here. Yup, all packed, all accounted for. - Greg, what the fuck? - Oh yeah, but you shoulda seen this coming. It's all in there. - What do you mean? What the fuck, I mean I pay rent too! - Yeah, in cash, dummy. There's no proof you ever lived here. No mail, no nothing. It's over for you, fucker. - Okay, but where the fuck am I supposed to go? Like all my shit.. - I don't know. But you probably should have thought about that before you started fucking with Fay. - What do you mean fucking with Fay? I mean, is he alright? - Nah. He's not alright. You know why? This is all your fault. - My fault. Oh, I'm sorry, cause I'm the one who called 911. But where the hell were ya'll when he was crying his eyes out? - Jay. Where'd he get the drugs from? Don't tell me he bought them himself. - Greg, I don't know where the fuck he got them drugs. - You know what. I'll never be able to prove that you did it, but at least I cut you out of my life. - Greg, I didn't do anything. I'm-- What the fuck-- You know what Greg, you know what, this is fucked up. This is so fucking fucked up. Of course you would do something like this. That is so fucked up and I would expect that from you. Yeah, exactly. I'm so fucking-- You know what, fuck you. - Hi Amer. - Hey muscles. You never cheated on me, did you? - No. I mean, Rachel's just a really good friend of mine. If anything, she's my work wife, but that's about it. - Well. - Do you even believe me? - I do. I mean, with everything that's been going on, I'm just now realizing how short life really is. I know I need to learn how to open my mind up more. And all that craziness was just my baggage that I was putting on you. I have a lot to work on. - Babe, we all do. - So, thank you for coming to my show, and thank you for being so nice to me now. I know I can be a bitch, and I don't deserve it. - Amer, I told you before, I don't believe in breaks. Cause I believe in trying to work things out. - You still wanna try? - Yeah. - But I thought because I hadn't heard from you in all this time-- - I needed space. And don't get me wrong, I really don't like the fact that you were following me, and that you didn't trust me. But you're not the first woman. And I know I can come off as secretive. That's something I gotta work on. You're crazy, but you're my lady. - Hey, Omar. - Oh, so now you know me? Now that you need something, nigger? - Look, I'm sorry. - Now you're fucking sorry? Now you're sorry after you bust me upside my head with a glass bottle? - Oh my god, like you started with me, like you had my ass fucking jumped-- - Cause you always selling yo ass. I told you not to fucking play me. - I mean, you know, you got somebody on the block all the-- - I'm on the block so that you don't have to be. You don't have to worry about shit cause I took care of you. But nah, you had to hustle, hooking and shit. So, where they at now, Jay? Where that white trick Neil at and that other bitch ass nigger? Nowhere to be found. You know what, just get this shit and put it in the trunk. I'm so mad right now, I could kill you. - Whew. Thank you, Omar and again, I'm sorry. - Oh, you're sorry? - Baby, you know I'm sorry an I'm gonna make it up to you. - You gonna make it up alright. - Hey you. - Hey Lonnie. - How are you feeling? - Better. Got your letter. When you said, "Let's meet at the highest place," I knew, just knew where you were talking about. - I know this is kind of like your place, but somehow I kind of feel like its ours. - Thank you for the flowers. - I hope you'd know they was from me. I didn't put my name on any of the cards because, man, I didn't want your dad to throw them away. - I figured as much. You been so mysterious lately. With the flowers and the cryptic letters. Thought you didn't believe in writing letters anymore. - Well, you gotta teach your old man, old dog, old tricks. But, we were so close to losing you. When you asked me if I loved you, then I said no, I was lying. But when I saw you lying there in the hospital.. (stammers) - I'm here, Lonnie. - I love you. - I love you, too. So what's next? Where do we go from here? - I don't know, we'll just have to figure out as we go. - You don't even live here anymore. - I'll move back. - Where would you live? - I'll get my place back. - I don't even have a job anymore. - We'll figure it out, together. - We're really gonna do this? We're gonna be together? - A lot of things are gonna have to change between the both of us. But, as long as we're doing it together.. - Everything will be alright. We have to make a promise to each other. - Kay. - Because love isn't enough. We have to promise to be understanding. - I could do that. - Patient, and truthful to one another. - Definitely. - Promise? - Promise.
