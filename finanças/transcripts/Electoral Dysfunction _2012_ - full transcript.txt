[MACHINE GUN FIRING...] I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE WAR ON TERROR. NOPE. AMERICA IS ENGAGED IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR-- BEING FOUGHT RIGHT HERE WITHIN OUR BORDERS-- OVER ONE OF DEMOCRACY'S MOST SACRED ACTS: VOTING. ON ONE SIDE, FORCES DEVOTED TO STOPPING WHAT THEY SAY IS POTENTIALLY MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD. TV Reporter: ACORN'S VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVES ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION IN SEVERAL STATES. WE NEED TO KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF SENATOR OBAMA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ACORN, WHO IS NOW ON THE VERGE OF MAYBE PERPETRATING ONE OF THE GREATEST FRAUDS IN VOTER HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY, MAYBE DESTROYING THE FABRIC OF DEMOCRACY. ON THE OTHER SIDE, A MOVEMENT THAT BELIEVES INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING SYSTEMATICALLY AND DELIBERATELY DISENFRANCHISED. Group: THE VOTE! THE VOTE! PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE! Bill Clinton: THERE HAS NEVER BEEN IN MY LIFETIME, SINCE WE GOT RID OF THE JIM CROW BURDENS ON VOTING, THE DETERMINED EFFORT TO LIMIT THE FRANCHISE THAT WE SEE TODAY. Rocca: THOSE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE? MILLIONS OF AMERICAN VOTERS JUST LIKE YOU AND ME. AND NO, YOUR FLAT FEET ARE NOT GONNA KEEP YOU OUT OF THIS ONE. [♪...] I'M MO ROCCA. MY JOURNEY BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN I HEADED TO THE FRONT LINES OF THIS EPIC AND ONGOING BATTLE. I WANTED TO SEE FOR MYSELF HOW VOTING WORKS IN AMERICA. ...ROCCA THE VOTE! ROCCA THE VOTE! ...WHAT I FOUND WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKING... IT'S JUST A SIMPLE LITTLE THING-- THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM BALLOTS THROUGH THAT MACHINE ON ELECTION DAY. SOMETIMES ENCOURAGING... WE WANT THE BALLOTS TO TIP TO OUR SIDE, OBVIOUSLY, AS REPUBLICANS... BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE DEMOCRATS, TOO. THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE. SO I ROOT FOR THE GOOD ONES. AND ALWAYS SURPRISING. Man: REDNECKS FOR OBAMA! Man 2: HELL YEAH, ABSOLUTELY! THIS IS MY WAR DIARY. [BRASS BAND PLAYS "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL"...] [PAPER SHREDDING...] [MUSIC ENDS] O.K., SO WHO GETS TO VOTE IN AMERICA? WELL, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO VOTE IF YOU'RE BORN HERE. SIMPLE ENOUGH. TELL ME WHAT THE TROUBLE IS. I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY. Man: I HEREBY DECLARE ON OATH... All: I HEREBY DECLARE ON OATH... YOU ALSO GET TO VOTE IF YOU BECOME A CITIZEN. SO FAR, SO GOOD. BUT HISTORY IS CHOCK-FULL OF STORIES ABOUT EXCLUDED GROUPS FIGHTING AND DYING TO GET THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES DUE AMERICAN CITIZENS. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION... ...IS VOTING A RIGHT OR A PRIVILEGE? A RIGHT. IS VOTING A RIGHT OR A PRIVILEGE? I THINK IT'S, UH... BOTH. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE. I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A RIGHT AND A PRIVILEGE? YEAH, THAT'S THE WAY THE GAME IS PLAYED. OH, I THINK IT'S A RIGHT. WHAT DOES YOUR FRIEND THINK? TYLER, DO YOU THINK VOTING IS A RIGHT OR A PRIVILEGE? HE THINKS IT'S A RIGHT, TOO. VOTING IS A PRIVILEGE... UM... WHICH IS WHAT I TELL MY STUDENTS. I THINK IF YOU'RE A CITIZEN, THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. ALL RIGHT, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME CONFUSION HERE. SO WHO BETTER TO SORT THIS OUT FOR ME THAN SOME OF OUR COUNTRY'S NEWLY MINTED CITIZENS? I MEAN, THEY JUST TOOK A TEST ON THIS STUFF. LUCKILY WE HAPPENED UPON A GIANT COPY OF THE CONSTITUTION AND WENT TO WORK. ...YOU'RE UP IN ARTICLE 1, IS THERE ANYTHING THERE? Woman: NOTHING. THIS IS THE WRONG COPY, I THINK. NO, THIS IS THE CONSTITUTION. THIS IS THE CONSTITUTION... I THINK IT IS THAT. YEAH... NO, SAM, I THINK YOU'RE OVER IN CONGRESS RIGHT HERE. ANY VOTING THERE? I DON'T FIND ANYTHING. Woman: THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THERE BUT NOTHING ABOUT VOTING. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT... I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING. YEAH, I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. ...BUT EVEN USING A HIGH-TECH MAGNIFYING DEVICE, WE WERE COMING UP EMPTY. I DECIDED I NEEDED HELP FROM AN EXPERT. ...I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND I CAN'T FIND IT. I'M NOT SURPRISED. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE CONSTITUTION. YOU'RE NOT KIDDING ME? NO, I'M NOT KIDDING YOU. UM... THE CONSTITUTION AT THE NATION'S BIRTH MADE NO MENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS WHATSOEVER. DID THEY JUST FORGET TO? NO, THEY DIDN'T FORGET TO. THEY WERE UNSURE, IN FACT, WHETHER VOTING WAS A RIGHT OR A PRIVILEGE. AND IF IT WAS A RIGHT, THEY WEREN'T SURE WHO THE RIGHT ACTUALLY BELONGED TO. THIS CONSTITUTIONAL SILENCE ON THE RIGHT TO VOTE PUTS THE U.S. IN THE COMPANY OF NATIONS LIKE LIBYA, IRAN AND INDONESIA. IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHAT WE HAVE IS A KIND OF RAGTAG SERIES OF AD-HOC CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED THROUGH POPULAR STRUGGLE TO SAY YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RACE-- THE 15th AMENDMENT-- YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF SEX-- THE 19th AMENDMENT-- PEOPLE IN THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS-- THE 23rd. BUT OTHER THAN THESE KIND OF ANTI-DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENTS, WE DON'T HAVE THE AFFIRMATIVE UNIVERSAL RIGHT TO VOTE LIKE YOU FIND IN THE SOUTH AFRICA CONSTITUTION, WHICH JUST SIMPLY SAYS, "EVERYBODY'S GOT A RIGHT TO VOTE," THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A DEMOCRACY, THAT'S WHAT "WE THE PEOPLE" REALLY MEANS. JAMIE TOLD ME THAT THE DRAFTERS OF THE CONSTITUTION SIDESTEPPED THE CONFLICT BY LEAVING THE DECISION ABOUT WHO COULD OR COULD NOT VOTE UP TO THE STATES. IT ALL STARTED WHEN 13 COLONIES DECIDED TO HOOK UP AND MAKE A GO OF IT. BUT AS IN ANY RELATIONSHIP, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP ALL THEIR INDEPENDENCE. EACH COLONY WANTED THE POWER TO MAKE ITS OWN RULES, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS NEW COUNTRY COULD BE SO SMOTHERING AT TIMES. EVENTUALLY, THE NEW NATION DECIDED IT NEEDED TO START SEEING OTHER STATES-- 37 TO BE EXACT. HEY, DON'T JUDGE-- IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. AND EACH STATE BROUGHT ITS OWN BAGGAGE, OF COURSE. CITIES, TOWNS AND COUNTIES, ALL OF WHICH WANTED THEIR OWN SAY IN HOW TO CONDUCT ELECTIONS. AFTER MORE THAN 200 YEARS, THIS LOOSEY-GOOSEY UNION HAS GROWN VERY COMPLICATED. 13,000 SEPARATE ELECTORAL DISTRICTS: EACH WITH ITS OWN RULES ABOUT VOTING, BALLOT DESIGN, POLL-WORKER TRAINING AND RECOUNTS. AND MOST OF THE BLAME GOES TO THAT CONSTITUTION, WHICH GAVE STATES CONTROL OVER VOTING AND SET UP... [RUMBLING] THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. [♪...] ...DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE? NO, I'M FROM TENNESSEE. GO UP TWO BLOCKS AND TURN LEFT. IT'LL BE THE FIRST DOOR ON YOUR RIGHT. I NEVER HEARD OF IT. WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE? THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN ANSWER THAT, CAN THEY? ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME, HAVE A GOOD ONE. Keyssar: THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WAS CREATED AFTER A SUMMER THAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS SPENT SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHOOSE A PRESIDENT. ONE THOUGHT WAS TO HAVE CONGRESS CHOOSE THE PRESIDENT. THEN THEY THOUGHT, "NO, THAT WOULD MAKE THE PRESIDENT TOO DEPENDENT ON CONGRESS." THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE WHO SAID, "LET'S HAVE A NATIONAL ELECTION." BUT THAT WAS OPPOSED PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS FELT THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW, WOULDN'T KNOW THE CANDIDATES. YOU KNOW, IT'S A RURAL COUNTRY, SPREAD OUT. THE OTHER REASON AGAINST A POPULAR ELECTION WAS THAT IT WOULD'VE GIVEN LESS POWER TO THE SOUTH, TO THE SLAVE-HOLDING SOUTH. THAT LED TO THE NOTORIOUS THREE-FIFTHS COMPROMISE, WHICH COUNTED EACH SLAVE AS THREE-FIFTHS OF A PERSON. THIS GAVE THE SOUTHERN STATES EXTRA REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS AND EXTRA VOTES IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, THEORETICALLY CREATING A BALANCE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH. OF COURSE, NEITHER SIDE ACTUALLY ALLOWED ENSLAVED PEOPLE TO VOTE. SO THOSE TWO OPTIONS, AN ACTUAL POPULAR VOTE OR CONGRESS CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT, SEEMED TO HAVE A LOT OF DISADVANTAGES, AND THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA, WHICH WAS NOT SO UNCOMMON AT THE TIME, OF HAVING AN INDIRECT ELECTION WHERE YOU CHOOSE ELECTORS AND THEN THE ELECTORS... UH... CHOOSE THE PRESIDENT. SOUNDS GOOD IN THEORY, BUT IN PRACTICE, WELL, EVEN A THIRD-GRADER CAN SEE THERE ARE PROBLEMS. ...WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE ELECTION HERE AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO CANDIDATES: COLORED PENCILS AND MARKERS. WHO IS VOTING FOR COLORED PENCILS? OKAY, 10 VOTES FOR COLORED PENCILS. WHO IS VOTING FOR MARKERS? 14 FOR MARKERS. MARKERS HAVE WON THE POPULAR VOTE. [CHILDREN WHOOP AND APPLAUD] AND NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE REAL ELECTION. [CHILDREN GROAN] NATURALLY, THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED. THEY THOUGHT WE'D JUST HAD THE ELECTION. BUT NOW IT WAS TIME TO WARP THESE YOUNG MINDS BY INTRODUCING THEM TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. SO WE BROKE THE CLASS INTO FIVE TABLES, OR STATES. THE MAJORITY AT EACH TABLE-- EITHER MARKERS OR COLORED PENCILS-- WOULD GET THE TABLE'S ONE ELECTORAL VOTE. OF COURSE IN REAL LIFE, STATES HAVE VARYING AMOUNTS OF ELECTORAL VOTES DEPENDING ON THE POPULATION. ...TABLE ONE'S ELECTOR, HOW DO YOU CAST YOUR VOTE? MARKERS. TABLE TWO'S ELECTOR, HOW DO YOU CAST YOUR VOTE? MARKERS. TABLE THREE'S ELECTOR? COLORED PENCILS. IN THE END, THE WHOLE ELECTION CAME DOWN TO ONE STATE. ...TABLE FIVE'S ELECTOR, ANGEL, COME ON DOWN. THIS IS IT, GUYS. THIS WILL DECIDE THE WHOLE THING. ELECTOR, HOW DO YOU CAST YOUR VOTE? COLORED PENCILS. [SOME CHILDREN CHEER] Boy: THAT WAS SO CHEATING! WHAT'S THAT? THAT WAS SO CHEATING! EVERYBODY SHOULD THINK IT'S UNFAIR BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ELECTORS' VOTES. IT'S ABOUT EVERYBODY'S VOTES. AUBREY, YOU ARE A RABBLE-ROUSER, I MEAN CLEARLY YOU'RE TRYING TO WHIP THEM UP INTO A FRENZY. IT HAS TO BE FAIR FOR EVERYBODY WHO VOTED FOR MARKERS, NOT JUST FOR COLORED PENCILS. IT'S 14 TO 10. IT SHOULD STAY THAT WAY. THIS GUY IS A DANGEROUS REFORMER. ...YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE THIS HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE. OH... ACTUALLY, IT DID. THEY SET UP THIS ELECTORAL COLLEGE BUSINESS AND SINCE THEN, NEARLY ONE IN 10 PRESIDENTS TOOK THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT WINNING THE POPULAR VOTE. LIKE ME: JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. I'M RUTHERFORD B. HAYES. I LOST THE POPULAR VOTE AND I ALMOST CAUSED A SECOND CIVIL WAR. WHOOPS, MY BAD. BUT, DON'T BLAME ME. BLAME THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. I'M GEORGE W. BUSH AND I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS THE EDUCATION PRESIDENT... STARTING WITH MY FAVORITE COLLEGE-- THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. HEH-HEH-- THAT'S IN FLORIDA, RIGHT? Raskin: THE KEY THING THAT FRUSTRATES PEOPLE ABOUT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE TODAY IS THAT IT SIDELINES AND MARGINALIZES TWO-THIRDS TO THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY. MOST OF US LIVE IN RED STATES OR BLUE STATES. TAKE OUR FOUR BIGGEST STATES. THREE OF THEM ARE SAFE STATES. TEXAS, A RED STATE; CALIFORNIA, A BLUE STATE; NEW YORK, A BLUE STATE; ONLY FLORIDA IS SOMETIMES A SWING STATE. THAT MEANS, IN THREE OF OUR FOUR BIGGEST STATES, THERE'S NO CAMPAIGNING, THE VOTER TURNOUT RATE IS LIKE FIVE TO 10 POINTS LOWER THAN IT IS IN THE SWING STATES, WHERE ALL THE TV ADS ARE. WHY SHOULD THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC HAVE NO REAL ROLE IN ELECTING THE PRESIDENT? IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE? A CREAKY ELECTORAL COLLEGE. A CONSTITUTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE US THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AND YET EVERY YEAR, THERE IS AN ELECTION OF SOME KIND, SOMEWHERE. IF I WAS GOING TO UNDERSTAND HOW VOTING REALLY WORKS IN AMERICA, I'D NEED TO JUMP INTO THE THICK OF IT-- IN A SWING STATE, OF COURSE, SINCE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY DECIDE OUR ELECTIONS. A PLACE WHERE THE PASSION FOR POLITICS RUNS DEEP, RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF AMERICA'S HEARTLAND. Kate Smith: ♪ BACK HOME AGAIN IN INDIANA... ♪ THAT'S RIGHT-- INDIANA, THE HOOSIER STATE, HOME TO SOME OF THE TOUGHEST ELECTION LAWS IN THE COUNTRY.

SEVENTH GENERATION HERE IN JENNINGS COUNTY. FAMILY'S BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME. VERY STRONG DEMOCRATS. MIKE MARSHALL, A FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE, ISN'T ONLY ENTHUSIASTIC, HE'S ALSO EFFECTIVE. IN 2004, REPUBLICANS WON EVERY COUNTY OFFICE EXCEPT ONE. IN 2006, AFTER MIKE STARTED HIS GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EFFORT, DEMOCRATS WON EVERY COUNTY OFFICE EXCEPT ONE. IMPRESSIVE BRAGGING RIGHTS FOR A DYED-IN-THE-WOOL POLITICAL INSIDER. [FIFE-AND-DRUM BAND PLAYS...] SO IS THE REPUBLICAN FLOAT FIRST AND THEN YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICANS AFTER? IS THAT RIGHT? I BELIEVE SO. O.K., THAT'LL WORK. THAT'S GOOD... ACROSS THE AISLE AND DOWN THE ROAD IN NEIGHBORING RIPLEY COUNTY LIVES DEE DEE BENKIE. HEY, LARRY! DEE DEE ONCE WORKED AT THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE WITH KARL ROVE AND WAS RECENTLY ELECTED TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. I FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ACTIVE, YOU KNOW, NOT SOMEONE TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES. SOMEONE TO, UH, TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE INVOLVED IN POLITICS... THEY WANT TO DO THAT. [DRUMMING...] Parade announcer: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE BIG RED, WHITE AND BLUE! Benkie: I ENDED UP WORKING WITH THE BUSH CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I WAS IN A LEADERSHIP POSITION WITH YOUNG REPUBLICANS. OF COURSE, I WAS A VERY LOW-LEVEL STAFFER BUT PRESIDENT BUSH COULDN'T HAVE BEEN NICER. [DRUMMING...] AFTER I LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE, I WANTED TO COME BACK HOME TO INDIANA, BACK TO MY ROOTS AND REALLY DO A LOT OF ON-THE-GROUND POLITICAL WORK. BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN WASHINGTON, PEOPLE... I THINK THEY LOSE TOUCH WITH, UM, THE REAL WORLD, AND I JUST WANTED TO GO HOME. WHILE DEE DEE WORKED THE CROWD AT THE PARADE, BACK IN JENNINGS COUNTY, MIKE MARSHALL FOCUSED ON GETTING OUT THE VOTE. I WENT TO HER HOUSE AT 11:00 LAST NIGHT AND I'D BEEN OUT THERE THREE OTHER DIFFERENT DAYS BECAUSE WE HAD TO GET HER SIGNED UP BY THE DEADLINE LAST NIGHT BY MIDNIGHT. WE FOUND HER AT HOME AT 11:15; SHE WAS ASLEEP. I WOKE HER UP. WE GOT HER SIGNED UP SO IT WOULD ARRIVE AT THE ELECTION OFFICE LAST NIGHT BY FAX BEFORE THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE. [CLAPS] AND I WAS VERY SATISFIED. THAT'S A RUSH TO ME. PART OF MIKE'S EFFECTIVENESS COMES FROM HIS ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE INDIANA'S VOTING STATUTES, ESPECIALLY SINCE PASSAGE OF THE STATE'S PHOTO I.D. LAW. IN THE 2004 ELECTION, INDIANA WENT VERY REPUBLICAN AND THE REPUBLICANS HAD CONTROL OF THE STATE SENATE AND THEY CONTROLLED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN INDIANAPOLIS AND THEY HAD A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. AND THEY RAILROADED THIS, UH, NEW PHOTO I.D. LAW THROUGH. INDIANA'S PHOTO I.D. LAW, THE FIRST IN THE NATION, WAS QUICKLY CHALLENGED AND EVENTUALLY WOUND UP IN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, WHERE IT WAS RULED CONSTITUTIONAL, EVEN THOUGH THERE HAD NEVER BEEN AN INSTANCE OF VOTER IMPERSONATION IN INDIANA, THE ONLY TYPE OF VOTER FRAUD THE BILL ADDRESSES. BUT HEY, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF CRIMINAL ELEMENT YOU'RE GONNA FIND AT THE POLLS. WE WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME 80- AND 90-YEAR-OLD NUNS IN INDIANA AND APPARENTLY THEY HAD HEARD THE NEW RULES THAT YOU HAVE TO COME WITH I.D., BUT THEY SHOWED UP WITH OUTDATED PASSPORTS AND SUCH AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD STILL VOTE-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WERE TURNED AWAY. THEY WERE BARRED FROM VOTING. THE NUNS WEREN'T ALONE. ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY, AN ESTIMATED 13% OF INDIANA'S REGISTERED VOTERS DON'T HAVE THE REQUIRED I.D. THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN HIGHER AMONG STUDENTS, THE ELDERLY, AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS. ALL OF THIS CAUSED QUITE A RUCKUS, SO I SOUGHT OUT ONE OF THE LAW'S AUTHORS IN THE INDIANA STATE SENATE. ...DID YOU KNOW HOW CONTROVERSIAL THE LAW WOULD BE? HOW MUCH OF A BACKLASH THERE WOULD BE AGAINST IT? WELL, I WOULD QUESTION WHETHER THERE WAS THAT MUCH OF A BACKLASH AGAINST IT. WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY DISTRICT AND TALKED TO MY OWN CONSTITUENTS, FOR MANY OF THEM IT SEEMED TO BE A NO-BRAINER. THEY WERE USED TO SHOWING I.D. FOR A VARIETY OF COMMON TASKS, WHETHER IT WAS RENTING A MOVIE OR, UH... WRITING A CHECK, SO TO EXTEND THIS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTION PROCESS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY CONSTITUENTS SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO. DESPITE THE STATED INTENTIONS OF THE LAW'S AUTHORS, MANY CITIZENS-- SOME OF THEM REGISTERED TO VOTE FOR DECADES-- SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES NO LONGER ABLE TO VOTE. THEY WANTED TO SEE MY I.D. AND I SHOWED 'EM MY PICTURE I.D. AND THEY SAID, "WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD BECAUSE IT'S TOO OLD." SO, UH, I DIDN'T GET TO VOTE. YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH 'EM VERY MUCH. WHATEVER POLITICS IS IN, THAT'S THE ONES THAT RUN THE SHOW. SO-- I MISSED A YEAR. [CHUCKLES] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERYBODY IN THAT POLL KNEW WHO YOU WERE. OH, YEAH. LIKE YOU NEEDED AN I.D.? THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE? EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. EVEN IN A SMALL TOWN, WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS, NO I.D. MEANS NO VOTE. NOT SURPRISINGLY, MORE AND MORE VOTERS ARE MISSING OUT. Woman: WE HAVE THE STRICTEST VOTER I.D. LAW IN THE COUNTRY. SINCE I'VE BEEN CLERK, WHICH HAS BEEN SIX YEARS NOW, WE HAVE TURNED AWAY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THIS I.D. THAT THEY NEED. AND I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE: EVERY SINGLE DAY PEOPLE WALK UP TO ME AND SAY, "I DON'T HAVE MY I.D." OR "IT EXPIRED" OR "MY KIDS TOLD ME I SHOULDN'T DRIVE ANYMORE" OR "MY PURSE WAS STOLEN YESTERDAY AND ELECTION DAY IS TOMORROW. WHAT CAN I DO?" THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT TRIPS PEOPLE UP. IT SHOULD NOT BE SO HARD. PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED. WE HAVE TERRIBLE VOTING IN INDIANA. I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED TO OTHERS WHO TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE 48th OF THE 50 STATES IN PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. IT'S EMBARRASSING. IT'S SHAMEFUL. AND PART OF THE REASON, I HEAR EVERY DAY, "IT'S JUST TOO HARD." WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO IN TERMS OF MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO GET I.D. THEY CAN GET IT FOR FREE. WE'VE EXTENDED THE HOURS AT OUR B.M.V. WE'VE GIVEN AFFIDAVIT POWER TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE RELIGIOUS OBJECTIONS TO HAVING THEIR PHOTO TAKEN. WE'VE GIVEN THE RIGHT FOR THE INDIGENT TO BE WAIVED FROM GETTING AN I.D. IT'S, UM, IT'S AN EFFORT, BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S A MINIMAL AND REASONABLE EFFORT AND THAT'S WHAT THE COURTS HAVE FOUND AS WELL. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO SAY, "WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE, GO TO THE D.M.V. AND GET A GOVERNMENT-ISSUED PHOTO I.D." WELL, I SAY THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD ON PAPER, BECAUSE THE STATE DID PASS IN THEIR LAW THAT IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR A STATE I.D., YOU CAN GET ONE FOR FREE, UM, FOR VOTING PURPOSES. WHAT THEY DON'T-- WHAT ISN'T CLEARLY ARTICULATED, THOUGH, IS THAT IT'S NOT REALLY FREE UNLESS YOU HAVE A HOST OF DOCUMENTATION NEEDED TO ACQUIRE THAT. SAY YOU'RE BORN IN MARION COUNTY, WHERE INDIANAPOLIS IS LOCATED. YOU GO TO THE MARION COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, YOU FILL OUT THIS FORM. UM, IT'S GOING TO COST YOU AROUND $12 TO GET YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE. FOR MOST PEOPLE, $12 IS NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT WHAT IF IT IS? THAT'S A FINANCIAL BARRIER. YOU THEN HAVE TO HAVE THIS FORM SIGNED BY A NOTARY PUBLIC, WHICH, AGAIN, IS GOING TO COST YOU SOMETHING. YOU GOTTA GO FIND ONE. YOU GOTTA FIND ONE, YOU GOTTA PAY FOR A NOTARY PUBLIC, SO, AGAIN, IS THE I.D. REALLY FREE? BUT THIS IS KIND OF THE KICKER HERE: THE NOTARY PUBLIC HAS TO MARK ONE OF THESE FOUR BOXES, THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT IN EITHER A VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE, A VALID STATE IDENTIFICATION CARD, A VALID MILITARY CARD, OR A VALID PASSPORT. IF YOU HAD ANY OF THESE THINGS, YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO REQUEST YOUR-- YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE. --BIRTH CERTIFICATE. SO IT'S KIND OF A CATCH-22? YES. THE VOTER I.D. LAWS ARE THE NEW, MODERN-DAY POLL TAX. THEY'RE NOT PREVENTING FRAUD. THEY'RE PREVENTING VOTING. I WOULD MAKE THE I.D. REQUIREMENT, UM, NO I.D. BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED IT, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IMPERSONATION HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY. RIGHT NOW, WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FEDERAL LAW THAT REQUIRES WHEN YOU REGISTER, FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU VOTE, YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME KIND OF IDENTIFICATION, BUT IT'S MULTIPLE FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION. COULD BE YOUR EMPLOYEE I.D., IT COULD BE YOUR CREDIT CARD, IT COULD BE A PAYCHECK, UM, THAT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE THE PERSON YOU ARE. NOW, NO I.D. MAY SOUND EXTREME, BUT IN FACT, MORE THAN HALF OUR STATES HAVE NEVER REQUIRED A PHOTO I.D. [DOORBELL CHIMES] I CAUGHT UP WITH DEE DEE AT HER HOME IN RIPLEY COUNTY, WHERE SHE AND A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE PREPARING FOR A SARAH PALIN RALLY. Benkie: O.K., EVERYBODY. THIS IS MO ROCCA. HI, HOW ARE YA? Students: HI! DEE DEE SUPPORTS THE PHOTO I.D. LAW. WHAT ANGERS HER IS AN ITEM CALLED THE ABSENTEE BALLOT, A TOOL MIKE MARSHALL DEPENDS ON, AND ONE THAT REQUIRES NO PHOTO I.D. AT ALL. YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR PHOTO I.D. TO VOTE. WELL, YOU SHOULD. YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR PHOTO I.D. TO BLOCKBUSTER, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, O.K. I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO WHIP OUT THE I.D.? JUST ABOUT, YOU KNOW, FOR EVERYTHING, SO THAT'S GOOD, BUT FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS THERE'S, THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM. THAT'S NOT GOOD. I THINK IT SHOULD BE THE SAME LEVEL. Rocca: SO IT CONCERNS YOU. IT CONCERNS ME GREATLY. I THINK IT IS A LONG-TERM PROBLEM. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT JUST AS-- I DON'T WANT TO SAY HARD-- BUT TO ENSURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE VOTE, IT IS ACCURATE. THERE'S JUST SOME FISHY THINGS GOING ON EVEN... IN THE AREA. WITH ABSENTEE BALLOTS? YEAH. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY ABSENTEE BALLOTS THAT ARE BEING CAST IN BIG STACKS, PEOPLE ARE BRINGING THEM IN BIG STACKS... UH, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT AT LEAST GIVES YOU PAUSE. DEE DEE WAS CERTAINLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE ABSENTEE BALLOT ISSUE, BUT I WONDERED IF THE AVERAGE HOOSIER WAS AS WORRIED AS SHE WAS. ...ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT VOTER FRAUD? UH... YES. WHAT KIND? UH... DEMOCRATS. SIGNING THESE PEOPLE UP TO VOTE WHEN THEY AIN'T SUPPOSED TO VOTE, 73 TIMES FOR ONE GUY. THAT'S A CROCK OF BULL. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SAYING, PEOPLE, UH... MICKEY MOUSE IS REGISTERED TO VOTE. SO, YOU KNOW... ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT MICKEY MOUSE WOULD THEN SHOW UP AT THE POLLS, OR...? NO, BUT IF SOMEONE HAS AN ABSENTEE AND... I DON'T KNOW, IT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN. I COULD SEE THAT IT COULD. A LOT OF PEOPLE I TALKED TO IN INDIANA ARE TERRIFIED. THEY'VE HEARD THAT VOTER FRAUD IS EVERYWHERE AND THAT THEIR VOTES MAY NOT END UP COUNTING AT ALL. WELL, THAT'S A REAL SHAME BECAUSE, UM, MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS, BUT VOTER FRAUD AND, BY WHICH I MEAN INELIGIBLE PEOPLE SHOWING UP AT THE POLLS AND VOTING, IMPERSONATING ANOTHER VOTER, IS ACTUALLY EXTRAORDINARILY RARE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS, UM... IT IS... AMERICANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING THAN THEY ARE TO COMMIT VOTER FRAUD. IT IS A SERIOUS CRIMINAL PENALTY TO COMMIT THIS KIND OF VOTER FRAUD. IT CARRIES $10,000 IN FINES AND FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND IT'S REASONABLY EASY TO GET CAUGHT, AND BY CONTRAST, ALL YOU GAIN IS ONE MARGINAL VOTE. YOU CAN'T SWING AN ELECTION THAT WAY AND YOU RISK A WHOLE LOT. SO, UM, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION? WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THE VOTING SYSTEM. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE IS THE VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM. THIS IS THE NUMBER-ONE CAUSE OF VOTER DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND IT'S THE NUMBER-ONE SOURCE OF PRE-ELECTION DISPUTES WITH POLITICAL PARTIES, THE NUMBER-ONE AREA WHERE YOU CAN REALLY MANIPULATE WHO GETS TO VOTE AND TRY TO KNOCK OFF THE OTHER SIDE'S VOTERS. [♪...] BACK IN INDIANA, DEE DEE AND MIKE WERE HUSTLING TO GET ANY UNREGISTERED FOLKS ONTO THE VOTER ROLLS BEFORE THE STATE'S DEADLINE, WHICH COMES 29 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN OHIO, CITIZENS CAN REGISTER AND VOTE ON THE SAME DAY-- A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE EXTREME INCONSISTENCY AMONG AMERICA'S 13,000 VOTING DISTRICTS. O.K., WELL, HERE ARE ABSENTEES. O.K., AND THEY ARE A PART OF THIS LITERATURE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO-- I MEAN, IT'S GOOD THOUGH. [CHUCKLES] TWO HERE, ONE THERE, ANOTHER HERE. YOU NEED TO REGISTER TO VOTE, IS THAT RIGHT? YES. ALL RIGHT! COME GET REGISTERED! Man passing on motorcycle: OBAMA! OBAMA! WHOO! HOW YOU DOING, MAN? FOR MIKE AND THE DEMOCRATS, GETTING OUT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY. WE'RE GONNA GET HIM IN, AREN'T WE? I HEARD THAT. WE'RE GONNA WIN INDIANA FOR HIM, AREN'T WE? YEP! ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT A DEMOCRAT HASN'T WON THE STATE IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE L.B.J. IN 1964. YOU NEED TO REGISTER? [MIKE AND WOMAN LAUGH] WE NEED YOUR VOTE FOR OBAMA. [DOG BARKING] YOU'RE A SWEET LITTLE PUPPY. WHOO! THAT'S TAKES A LOT OF-- [♪...] [SCRAPING BOOTS ON CONCRETE] ARE YOU REGISTERED TO VOTE, GIRL? NO. CAN WE SIGN YOU UP SO YOU CAN VOTE THIS YEAR? I THOUGHT CONVICTED FELONS COULDN'T VOTE. [TIRES SCREECH] O.K., HOLD THE PHONE! PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME FOR A FELONY CAN'T VOTE? NO, IN INDIANA YOU CAN. OH, I CAN? THE REPUBLICANS TELL EVERYBODY IF THEY HAVE A FELONY, THEY CAN'T VOTE, JUST 'CAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO, BUT IN INDIANA YOU CAN. HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT MAKES ELECTION LAWS SO CONFUSING. IN INDIANA, FORMER FELONS ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE, BUT DOWN IN MISSISSIPPI, PEOPLE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN FELONIES LOSE ALL VOTING RIGHTS FOR LIFE... [PRISON DOOR SLAMS] UNLESS-- AND GET THIS-- THE GOVERNOR PARDONS THEM OR THE LEGISLATURE PASSES A PERSONALIZED BILL RESTORING THEIR VOTING RIGHTS. A CANTON MAN CONVICTED OF VOTER FRAUD IS GIVEN THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE. TERRANCE WATTS WILL SERVE 10 YEARS IN PRISON FOR VOTING ILLEGALLY TWICE. AFTER SERVING TIME FOR A FELONY, WATTS-- WHO WAS STILL ON THE REGISTRATION ROLLS-- BROKE THE LAW BY MERELY VOTING IN TWO SEPARATE ELECTIONS. HE'S SCHEDULED FOR RELEASE IN 2020. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. HERE IT IS, SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE THEIR TIME, PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY. THEY COME OUT, THEY'RE GETTING THEIR LIFE TOGETHER AND THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN DEMOCRACY AND THEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY GOT MISINFORMATION ABOUT VOTING AND THEN GET A 10-YEAR SENTENCE? IT'S RIDICULOUS. BUT WE HAVE THESE ARCHAIC LAWS ON THE ROLLS, WHICH ACTUALLY... LIKE VIRGINIA AND FLORIDA, FOR EXAMPLE-- FLORIDA HAS ABOUT 900,000 PEOPLE WITH FELONY CONVICTIONS WHO CANNOT VOTE. WE REALLY NEED TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE YOU'VE DONE YOUR TIME, YOU JUST GET YOUR RIGHTS BACK. Marshall: GET SEVEN BUTTONS, AND UH... HOW MANY YARD SIGNS DO YOU GUYS WANT? 24 HOURS BEFORE THE REGISTRATION DEADLINE AND BOTH PARTIES ARE STILL AT IT. ALL THE LEGWORK AND LONG HOURS SEEM TO BE PAYING OFF: MORE THAN 740,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO INDIANA'S VOTER ROLLS. BUT IS THIS PIECEMEAL APPROACH, REGISTERING ONE NEW VOTER AT A TIME, REALLY THE BEST WAY? WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW INDUSTRIALIZED DEMOCRACIES RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T HAVE A SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL VOTER REGISTRATION, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT AUTOMATICALLY AND PERMANENTLY ENSURES THAT EACH ELIGIBLE VOTER IS ON THE ROLLS. THERE ARE 50 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE VOTERS WHO ARE NOT ON THE VOTER ROLLS. WE HAVE NOW A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM AND REFORM IT AND TO ACTUALLY AUTOMATICALLY AND PERMANENTLY ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE CITIZENS ARE ON THE VOTER ROLLS. VIRTUALLY ALL AMERICANS HAVE THEIR INFORMATION IN OTHER GOVERNMENT LISTS: IN DRIVER'S LICENSE LISTS, IN PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AGENCY LISTS, IN TAX LISTS, IN SCHOOL LISTS AND MOST OF THOSE LISTS HAVE BEEN VERY WELL VETTED AND VOTERS HAVE PROVIDED A LOT OF INFORMATION TO THOSE OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. SO THIS IS A VERY SECURE-- MUCH MORE SECURE THAN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM-- AND VERY ACCURATE WAY OF GETTING MANY, MANY MORE ELIGIBLE VOTERS ON THE ROLLS. BUT WHILE PEOPLE LIKE WENDY ARE ADVOCATING FOR GETTING MORE VOTERS ON THE ROLLS, OTHERS ARGUE FOR BEING MORE SELECTIVE. I'VE SAID, AND CRITICIZED HEAVILY BECAUSE I SAID THIS, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CIVICS TEST. NOW, I KNOW WE CAN'T, I KNOW THE, UH, VOTER ACT OF '65 CHANGED A LOT OF THINGS, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T EXPECT A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY, BORN HERE, TO AT LEAST BE AS INFORMED ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT THAT HE OR SHE LIVES UNDER AS WE EXPECT FROM AN IMMIGRANT WHO COMES HERE, AND HAS TO TAKE A TEST IN ORDER TO BECOME A CITIZEN. AND BELIEVE ME, LOTS OF BROWN PEOPLE, LOTS OF BLACK PEOPLE, LOTS OF MINORITIES PASS THAT TEST. RIGHT. ...TOM TANCREDO'S TEST ISN'T SO FAR-FETCHED. UNTIL 1965, DOZENS OF STATES REQUIRED CERTAIN VOTERS TO PASS ONE TEST OR ANOTHER. SO HISTORICALLY, WHO'S HAD THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND WHO HASN'T? WELL, WHITE GUYS WROTE THE RULES, SO INITIALLY THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO GOT THE PRIVILEGE. HEY-HO...! RICH, LAND-OWNING WHITE GUYS. OH, MAN! AFTER A WHILE THEY LET THE POOR WHITE GUYS VOTE. YEE-HAW! AND ODDLY, BLACK GUYS IN A FEW STATES. THREE-FIFTHS OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE BLACK! THAT ENDED PRETTY QUICKLY. EVENTUALLY THE IRISH WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE, AS WERE SOME NON-CITIZENS, BUT ONLY IF THEY WERE WHITE AND AS LONG AS THEY COULD PAY THE POLL TAX. A FEW WOMEN COULD VOTE FOR A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL THEY STOPPED THAT. AND BLACK PEOPLE AGAIN ALSO FOR A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL THEY STOPPED THAT AGAIN. WOMEN FINALLY GOT THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN 1920, BUT THERE WERE MAJOR ROADBLOCKS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, LIKE LITERACY TESTS. THE KIND WITH QUESTIONS LIKE, "HOW MANY BUBBLES ARE IN A BAR OF SOAP?" I'M NOT KIDDING. THAT PLAN WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THAT ONLY 5% OF MISSISSIPPI'S ELIGIBLE BLACK VOTERS HAD MANAGED TO REGISTER AS OF 1960. FINALLY, IN 1965, L.B.J. SIGNED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT-- WIPING OUT LITERACY TESTS. IT WASN'T UNTIL 1971, THANKS TO VIETNAM AND THE DRAFT, THAT WE DECIDED TO LET 18-YEAR-OLDS VOTE. AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN D.C. WHO DON'T HAVE FULL VOTING RIGHTS OR EVEN A SENATOR. THEY HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HOUSE, EXCEPT SHE DOESN'T GET TO VOTE. AND THAT'S WHO GETS TO VOTE IN AMERICA. [♪...] NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REGISTERED, THOUGH, NOT ALL VOTERS ARE CREATED EQUAL. I SET OUT TO MEET THOSE EXCLUSIVE FEW WHO ACTUALLY GET TO CAST THEIR VOTE FOR PRESIDENT: THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS. ...WELL, THIS IS IT. I'VE ARRIVED IN INDIANAPOLIS AND I'M GOING TO GO MEET MY FIRST ELECTOR. ...MEET BEN LEATHERBURY-- A FRESHMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA AND A DEMOCRATIC ELECTOR FROM DEE DEE AND MIKE'S CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. BEN'S FATHER WAS AN ELECTOR FOR JOHN KERRY IN 2004. THIS TIME AROUND HE'S HANDED THE JOB OFF TO BEN, AGE 19. ...IT KIND OF KICKS ASS THAT YOU'RE AN ELECTOR AND YOU'RE 19. YEAH, I LIKE IT. I MEAN, I GET TO GO TO THE STATE CAPITOL AND CAST A HISTORIC VOTE FOR BARACK OBAMA AND HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, SO... AND IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME. WHAT IF BETWEEN NOVEMBER 4th AND DECEMBER 15th, BARACK OBAMA DOES SOMETHING THAT REALLY TICKS YOU OFF, LIKE SOMETHING CRAZY, LIKE HE STEALS SOMEONE'S CAR... O.K. JUST FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE? I COULD VOTE FOR JOHN McCAIN AND THEN THEY GET MY ELECTORAL VOTE, BUT IN SOME STATES-- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT INDIANA-- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SIGN AN OATH AND SAYING THAT YOU WOULD VOTE FOR THE PERSON YOU DO, BUT THERE'S NO LAW AGAINST IT, SO... YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY, LIKE, A PENALTY. I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS. SO, UM... WHAT QUALIFICATIONS DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO HAVE TO BECOME AN ELECTOR? THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY QUALIFICATIONS, IT'S MORE OF WHAT YOU CAN'T DO. YOU CAN'T REBEL AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. IF YOU'VE DONE THAT BEFORE, THAT'S, THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO BECOME AN ELECTOR-- HAVE YOU DONE THAT? NO, I HAVEN'T. HAVE YOU COME CLOSE? NOT TOO CLOSE. AND THEN, UM, ANOTHER THING IS THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE A HIGH OFFICE IN STATE POLITICS, I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT. SO, I HOPE YOU LEARNED A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. I THINK I DID AND THIS COLLEGE IS NOT TOO BAD EITHER. YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. WELL, TAKE CARE. ALL RIGHT, SEE YA LATER. [DOORBELL DINGS] HELLO. HI, UM, I UNDERSTAND THAT A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR LIVES HERE. UH, THAT'S ME. I'M DAVID BUSKILL. OH, GREAT, I'M MO ROCCA. HI, NICE TO MEET YOU! BEN'S REPUBLICAN COUNTERPART, DAVID BUSKILL, ALSO GREW UP AROUND POLITICS. HE'S STAYED INVOLVED AS A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER, AMONG OTHER POSITIONS. I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS, WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR? IT'S PRETTY-- I MEAN, IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE ALWAYS ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT WHAT AN ELECTOR WAS. I WAS PROBABLY 9, 10. I GUESS THAT'S AROUND 6th GRADE, AND UH, HOW I BECAME AN ELECTOR, I JUST KIND OF ASKED ABOUT IT. SO, ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS ASK? THAT'S BASICALLY HOW I BECAME-- I KNOW IT MAY BE A DIFFERENT PROCESS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT I JUST ASKED. DO YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE SEAT OF POWER HAVING SIRED SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY GETS TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT? IT'S BEEN EXCITING BEING-- WELL, DAVID AND BEN WERE READY, WILLING AND ABLE TO CAST THEIR ALL-IMPORTANT VOTES. BUT BEFORE THE ELECTORS REPORT FOR DUTY, YOU AND I HAVE TO CAST OUR BALLOTS. IT'S A COMPLICATED PROCESS. DIRECTING THE OPERATION IN RIPLEY COUNTY IS REPUBLICAN GINGER BRADFORD. LIKE ALL COUNTY CLERKS IN INDIANA, SHE RUNS THE SHOW. HOW DO YOU DO? I'M FINE, THANK YOU. YOU'RE THE WOMAN WHO MAKES IT ALL HAPPEN HERE. I TRY, YES. WHAT IS SHE DOING? SHE'S DOING ABSENTEE VOTING. THIS WONDERFUL LADY, ROSALIND McKITTRICK, HAS VOTED AND NOW SHE'S BRINGING HER BALLOT BACK IN HERE AND SHE'S PROCESSING IT. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, DID SHE SHOW AN I.D.? YES, SHE DID. SHE SHOWED HER I.D. WHEN SHE CAME IN. IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, ABSENTEE VOTERS DO HAVE TO SHOW I.D. IF THEY TURN IN THEIR BALLOT IN PERSON. IF THEY MAIL IT IN, THEN THEY DON'T. YEAH, I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. NOW WHEN SHE GETS DONE HERE, THEY'LL PUT THIS IN. WE HAVE A BLACK BOX SITTING OVER HERE AND IT WILL GO IN THIS BLACK BOX. AND THIS BOX IS UNDER LOCK AND KEY-- SEE? OH, I WANTED TO PUT IT IN. [LAUGHS] NO, YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT. SHE WAS APPOINTED BY THE COUNTY CHAIRMAN FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND THIS WOMAN WAS APPOINTED BY THE COUNTY CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. Rocca: SHE'S A DEMOCRAT. IF IT TURNED OUT THAT YOU KNEW THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WERE REPUBLICANS AND YOU GO DOWN TO THE POST OFFICE TOGETHER AND SHE SAYS, "WAIT A MINUTE, I GOTTA GO USE THE LADIES' ROOM." YOU COULD JUST GO [WHOOSH] AND PUT THEM IN THE TRASH CAN. OH NO, I'D GET PUT IN JAIL. WHAT'S THAT? SHE'D BE PUT IN JAIL. OH, YOU'D BE PUT IN JAIL. NO, THAT'S WHY WE GO TOGETHER. SO YOU STAY TOGETHER. SO IT KEEPS YOU, IT'S LIKE A BUDDY SYSTEM BUT IT'S ALSO, LIKE, TO KEEP EACH OTHER HONEST. ...I DOUBTED THAT ANY OF THESE NICE WOMEN HAD EVER EVEN STOLEN A RECIPE, BUT I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THEIR SECURITY. NOW, WE'VE GOT A DEMOCRAT LOCK ON ONE SIDE AND A REPUBLICAN LOCK ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS PRETTY COMPLEX. AND THIS IS JUST ONE SMALL OFFICE IN ONE SMALL COUNTY. MULTIPLY IT BY 13,000 SIMILAR OPERATIONS AND YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF THE MASSIVE EFFORT IT TAKES TO CAST AND COUNT BALLOTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. LATER THAT DAY, I HEADED OVER TO THE COURTHOUSE WHERE GINGER WAS GIVING A TRAINING CLASS FOR POLL WORKERS. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO HANDLE AN IRATE VOTER WHO WANTS TO VOTE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT CREDENTIALS. CAN I HAVE A VOLUNTEER? OH GEE, MO, YOU WOULD BE GREAT. [LAUGHTER] NOW, MO, YOU'RE GONNA COME DOWN HERE AND YOU'RE GONNA TRY AND VOTE. HI, I'M HERE TO VOTE. ALL RIGHT, I NEED TO SEE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE. OH, UH... OH, NO, I DON'T HAVE IT, NO. WE NEED A DRIVER'S LICENSE. OH, I'VE VOTED HERE 12 TIMES BEFORE. WE STILL NEED THAT DRIVER'S LICENSE. I VOTED, UM, IN 1948 HERE FOR PRESIDENT. I STILL NEED THAT DRIVER'S LICENSE. UH, WELL, ALL RIGHT, LET ME, UH, OH, WELL, HERE'S A CREDIT CARD. NO. IT'S NOT WORKING. O.K., WELL, THEN I'LL SHOW YOU MY, UH, SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. NO, IT NEEDS TO HAVE A PICTURE ON IT. WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT I'M ME. I MEAN, COME ON, DON'T YOU REMEMBER? SADIE HAWKINS DANCE, YOU ASKED ME! NO, I DON'T. WELL, THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS. I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT MY, I HAVE A RIGHT TO VOTE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT DRIVER'S LICENSE, I CAN GIVE YOU A FORM AND YOU CAN GO TO THE LICENSE BRANCH AND YOU CAN GET A B.M.V. FREE I.D. WELL, I MEAN, SO I HAVE TO DRIVE DOWN THERE? YEAH. BUT I'VE BEEN DRINKING! [LAUGHTER] SORRY. WHAT ABOUT THIS? NO. [LAUGHTER] SORRY, BUT NICE PICTURE. WOULD YOU LET ME VOTE IF I SHOWED YOU THIS? NO. SEE? IN THERE IT SAYS MO IS MY FIRST NAME AND ROCCA. Woman: O.K. SO NOW CAN I VOTE? I DON'T THINK SO. I'D HAVE TO TALK TO THE INSPECTOR AND LET HER MAKE THAT DECISION. SO THE INSPECTOR WOULD BE HERE. RIGHT HERE. OH, YOU'RE THE INSPECTOR, WHAT DO YOU SAY? NO. WHY? I'M SORRY. YOU DON'T LIKE THE PICTURE? NO, IT'S A GREAT PICTURE, BUT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW OUR RULES. WELL, AT LEAST THEY SEEMED APPRECIATIVE OF MY AMTRAK MAGAZINE PHOTO SPREAD. BUT LET'S SAY I DID HAVE MY PICTURE I.D. WITH ME, ALL SYSTEMS GO? Woman: SIR, YOU ARE NOT ON OUR RECORDS. I'M SORRY, BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN VOTE IS IF YOU VOTE A PROVISIONAL BALLOT AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT IF YOU DO, IT MAY NOT BE COUNTED. AY YI YI. BECAUSE MY ELIGIBILITY HAD BEEN QUESTIONED, I WAS ONLY ABLE TO VOTE WITH A PROVISIONAL BALLOT, BUT HERE'S THE CATCH: NO PROVISIONAL BALLOTS ARE RECORDED ON ELECTION DAY; MANY ARE NEVER RECORDED AT ALL. ♪ WHEN I DREAM ABOUT THE MOONLIGHT ON THE WABASH ♪ ♪ THEN I LONG FOR MY INDIANA HOME. ♪ SIR, THIS IS A PIECE OF PAPER FOR DOCUMENTATION TO GET TO THE COURTHOUSE BY 6 P.M. TODAY. AM I BEING ARRESTED? NO, THIS IS AN ORDER FOR YOUR BALLOT TO BE COUNTED, IF THEY DECIDE TO COUNT IT, AND HERE'S YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. Ginger: EXCUSE ME, SIR? YES? HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING? I, UH-- I'M SORRY BUT YOU CANNOT ENTER OUR POLLS DRINKING. YOU ARE UNDER ARREST. IS THAT RIGHT? IS THAT TRUE? THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN? YES, IT WOULD. [APPLAUSE] DESPITE THE FACT THAT GINGER IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WITH PARTY AFFILIATION, IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE PARTISAN POLITICS INFLUENCING AN ELECTION IN HER COUNTY. BUT AS A STATE, INDIANA CAN LAY CLAIM TO ONE OF HISTORY'S MOST BITTERLY CONTESTED CONGRESSIONAL RACES, IN A DISTRICT KNOWN AS "THE BLOODY 8th." YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE, CHEERING] A 1984 RACE IN THE BLOODY 8th WAS SO CLOSE, CONGRESS STEPPED IN TO DECIDE IT-- A CONGRESS CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS. I WON-- I CAN LOOK ANYBODY IN THE EYE AND SHOW THEM THAT I WON. Newscaster: ON ELECTION NIGHT DEMOCRAT McCLOSKEY LED BY 72 VOTES. AFTER A STATE RECOUNT, REPUBLICAN RICK McINTYRE WAS CERTIFIED THE WINNER BY 418 VOTES. BUT BECAUSE OF DISPUTES OVER BALLOTS, HOUSE DEMOCRATS ORDERED A FEDERAL RECOUNT SUPERVISED BY DEMOCRATS. IT TURNED THE REPUBLICAN LEAD INTO A FOUR-VOTE DEMOCRATIC WIN. HOUSE REPUBLICANS ACCUSED THE DEMOCRATS OF STEALING THE ELECTION AND WORSE. THEN, ALMOST ALL 182 REPUBLICANS MARCHED OFF THE HOUSE FLOOR AND OUTSIDE. THE WALKOUT WAS UNPRECEDENTED. WE ARE ALL SO FRUSTRATED BY DEALING WITH AN ESSENTIALLY CORRUPT AND TYRANNICAL MAJORITY, A GROUP THAT HAS BROKEN INDIANA LAW, THAT HAS, IN OUR JUDGMENT, VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT NOW USES ITS NUMBERS TO STEAL A SEAT IN THE HOUSE, THAT ALMOST ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. THEN, OF COURSE, ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING POSSIBLE DID HAPPEN IN 2000. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA, I HEREBY DECLARE GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH THE WINNER OF FLORIDA'S 25 ELECTORAL VOTES FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW, WHAT TOOK PLACE IN 2000 IN FLORIDA WAS A PERFECT STORM OF EVERYTHING DYSFUNCTIONAL ABOUT OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM. Crowd: GET OUT OF CHENEY'S HOUSE! GET OUT OF CHENEY'S HOUSE! Raskin: FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED THROUGH IT, THIS WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, BLEEDING KANSAS OR THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG OR SOMETHING-- I MEAN, THIS WAS A TRAUMATIC MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN POLITICAL DEMOCRACY. IT ALL STARTED REALLY WITH A SERIES OF VERY RESTRICTIVE ELECTION RULES AND PRACTICES THAT WERE ENGINEERED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF FLORIDA, KATHERINE HARRIS, WHO MOONLIGHTED AS THE, UH, CHAIR OF THE BUSH FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN IN FLORIDA. HARRIS ORDERED A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR THAT WAS PAID MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS TO PURGE THE VOTING LISTS OF CONVICTED FELONS. AND SO, THEY GOT BACK A MEMO, WHICH SURFACED AFTER THE WHOLE ELECTION WAS OVER, UH, SAYING TO SECRETARY OF STATE HARRIS, "WE'RE NOT POSITIVE ABOUT SOME OF THESE NAMES," WHICH WERE IN OVERWHELMINGLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, UH, "WHAT SHOULD WE DO?" AND SHE SAID, "CAST A WIDE NET." IT WAS DETERMINED LATER THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE FALSELY DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE THEIR NAMES RESEMBLED THOSE OF CONVICTED FELONS. Crowd: STOP THE COUNT! STOP THE FRAUD! STOP THE COUNT! STOP THE FRAUD! STOP THE COUNT! STOP THE FRAUD! Raskin: THEN THERE WERE A WHOLE SERIES OF SCANDALS AND MISHAPS RELATING TO THE COUNTING OF THE BALLOTS. THERE WAS A BLIZZARD OF LAWSUITS, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY, THE SUPREME COURT STEPPED INTO A STATE, OVERRODE THE STATE SUPREME COURT'S INTERPRETATION OF ITS OWN LAWS TO SAY THAT IT MIGHT VIOLATE EQUAL PROTECTION TO COUNT PEOPLE'S BALLOTS. AND SO, RATHER THAN HAVING, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT NAME SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, HERE WE HAD THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES EFFECTIVELY NAME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Woman: PEOPLE SAY THAT THAT DECISION WAS NOT BASED ON JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, BUT ON POLITICS. I SAY, NONSENSE. WAS IT POLITICAL? GEE, I REALLY DON'T WANNA GET INTO-- I MEAN THIS IS-- GET OVER IT! IT'S SO OLD BY NOW. BUT IT WAS, IT ENDED UP BEING A POLITICAL DECISION. IT WAS AL GORE WHO MADE IT A JUDICIAL QUESTION. IT WAS HE WHO BROUGHT IT INTO THE FLORIDA COURTS; WE DIDN'T GO LOOKING FOR TROUBLE. [♪...] Robbie Fulks: ♪ I'M GOING BACK TO INDIANA ♪ ♪ BACK TO WHERE I STARTED FROM ♪ ♪ I'M GOING BACK TO INDIANA ♪ INDIANA, HERE I COME... [YODELING] IT'S NINE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE UNDER FIRE. JUST SIT RIGHT HERE. THE REPUBLICAN 9th DISTRICT CHAIRMAN HAS ASKED THE JENNINGS COUNTY CLERK AND ELECTION BOARD FOR COPIES OF ALL ABSENTEE BALLOT APPLICATIONS FOR THE UPCOMING VOTE. AND THEY WANT THEM BEFORE ELECTION DAY. "ACCORDING TO THE STATUTE, YOU HAVE 24 HOURS TO RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS REQUEST AND THE PENDING DATE FOR THE ELECTION, I WOULD ASK THAT YOU ASSIST ME IN HANDLING THIS REQUEST IN AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE ON THIS MATTER." LARRY SHICKLES, DISTRICT-- REPUBLICAN 9th DISTRICT CHAIRMAN. THE GROUP BELIEVES THE REQUEST IS BEING MADE SO THAT DEMOCRATIC VOTES CAN BE ELIMINATED BASED ON SIGNATURE IRREGULARITIES. IT'S THE APPLICANT'S SIGNATURE. THEY'RE GONNA GO TO THAT 89-YEAR-OLD VOTER, WHATEVER, AND THEY'RE GONNA ASK FOR A SAMPLE SIGNATURE. I DON'T SIGN MY NAME THE SAME WAY I DID WHEN I REGISTERED TO VOTE. I TOTALLY SIGN IT DIFFERENTLY. AND THEY WANT TO QUESTION IT, THEY WANT-- THEY WANT TO COMPARE, CHALLENGE IT. THE SIGNATURES. Woman: THEIR GOAL, IN MY OPINION, IS TO GET THEM ALL IN THE PROVISIONAL BALLOT. Marshall: THAT'S RIGHT. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WHAT THEY CAN'T STAND IS THAT WE, WE HAVE OUTWORKED 'EM. WE HAVE THREE TO FOUR TO ONE, ABSENTEE BALLOTS FOR EVERY REPUBLICAN ABSENTEE BALLOT. WE HAVE THREE TO FOUR TO ONE. THEY DON'T WANT THESE VOTES COUNTED, THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. AND WE WORK REALLY HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE THOSE VOTES DON'T COUNT. Marshall: IT'S GONNA GET NASTY-- GETTING REAL NASTY. ...WHAT'S CRITICAL ABOUT THIS, OF THEM WANTING COPIES OF THE APPLICATIONS IS IF THEY WANT COPIES, THEY GOT TO PRINT THOSE COPIES, RUN THEM THROUGH MACHINES, HANDLE THEM. IF THEY MESS ANYTHING UP... WITH THE APPLICATION, THEN IT WILL NOT, IT WILL INVALIDATE THE BALLOT. EVERY VOTE IS GONNA COUNT HERE. THIS ISN'T FLORIDA. THIS AIN'T THE SUNSHINE STATE. THIS IS INDIANA AND HOOSIER VALUES ARE GOING TO WORK RIGHT HERE BECAUSE THAT DOG DOES HUNT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. Robbie Fulks: ♪ I'M GOING BACK TO INDIANA ♪ ♪ INDIANA, HERE I COME ♪ I'M GOING BACK TO INDIANA 'CAUSE THAT IS WHERE MY BABY'S FROM... ♪ IT'S OCTOBER 31st, HALLOWEEN. THE COURTHOUSE GROUNDS WERE... "DECORATED" BY PRANKSTERS THE NIGHT BEFORE. TODAY A JUDGE WILL HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE BALLOT DISPUTE AND AT LEAST ONE TEAM IS FEELING PRETTY CONFIDENT. Man: WELL, WE CERTAINLY EXPECT IT'S GOING TO GO OUR WAY. IT'S A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD STATUTORY ISSUE AND I THINK THAT THE INTENT OF THE INDIANA LEGISLATURE IN DRAFTING THIS PUBLIC RECORDS LAW WAS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO SEE WHAT THEIR GOVERNMENT'S DOING, AND IF THEY CAN'T DO THAT BEFORE A FREE ELECTION, THEN WHEN CAN THEY HAVE IT? SO WE FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST SCAM FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, COMING IN HERE FROM THE 9th DISTRICT CHAIRMAN, COMING IN JENNINGS COUNTY. THE LOCAL REPUBLICANS, I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, IN THIS COUNTY, I CAN TELL YOU, THEY DO NOT AGREE. THEY DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS, THIS GOING ON. IT'S JUST A SIMPLE LITTLE THING: THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM BALLOTS THROUGH THAT MACHINE ON ELECTION DAY. THE DEMOCRAT BALLOTS. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. MR. SHICKLES. MR. MARSHALL OBVIOUSLY WAS A LITTLE EMOTIONAL IN HIS DESCRIPTION THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTION BOARD AND THE CLERK WAS BEING QUESTIONED, AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL. WHAT WE'RE LITERALLY QUESTIONING TODAY WAS THE LAW SAYS WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THOSE RECORDS. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE RECORDS. WITH ONLY FOUR DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE ELECTION, THE JUDGE WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A DECISION PRETTY QUICKLY. Man: PAID FOR BY THE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY. BECAUSE THE DAIRY COWS JUST WON'T MILK RIGHT. [MOOING] A BREAK FROM THE TENSIONS OF THE LAWSUIT COMES WHEN CLAYTON AND MIKE RECORD A RADIO AD SKEWERING THE GOVERNOR, MITCH DANIELS. HEY, DEMOCRAT. HEY, INDEPENDENT. DID YOU HEAR DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME COMING THIS SATURDAY? YES, SIR. GOT TO CHANGE THE CLOCKS AT 2 A.M. SUNDAY. WELL, IF YOU FORGET, GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH. GONNA BE LATE FOR WORK, KIDS GONNA BE LATE TO SCHOOL, GONNA BE LATE FOR DINNER AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE AFTER CHURCH. COWS JUST WON'T MILK RIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU ONE PLACE I WON'T BE LATE TO: THE POLLS ON TUESDAY. HELL, YEAH! I'M GONNA DITCH MITCH! [ON RADIO]: He did that Daylight Savings Time to us. Made us change our clocks. I'm gonna turn Ditch Mitch's clock back on Tuesday at the polls. Clocks going back or forwards? Hell if I know. Put us on the same time as New York City, he said, to help the Indiana economy. New York City? You with me, Independent? Yessir! YESSIR! Paid for by the local Democratic Party. Because the dairy cows... Both: JUST WON'T MILK RIGHT. [BOTH MOO, LAUGH] I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD ELECTION DAY. WE'RE GONNA TURN THEM DAMN DEMOCRATS OUT. OH, YEAH. MM-HMM. WELL, I DON'T KNOW, MOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU THINK McCAIN'S GONNA PULL IT OFF? WELL, WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP. OH, NO. NEVER GIVE UP. WELL, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SENATOR McCAIN WILL BE IN INDIANA THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. WHAT I WORRY ABOUT ARE THE ABSENTEE VOTES THAT ARE NOT LEGITIMATE. THAT IS WHAT I WORRY ABOUT. I JUST HOPE THAT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND PEOPLE SELLING THEIR VOTES. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THAT'S BEEN A LONG TIME AGO. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? WELL, THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT WOULD TARGET FAMILIES THAT NEEDED MONEY AND-- THE POOR FAMILIES-- AND THEY WOULD GIVE 'EM WHATEVER THEY WOULD ACCEPT, $10, $20, AND THEY WOULD BRING THEIR BALLOTS OUT AND TO THE PERSON THAT BOUGHT, YOU KNOW, PAID THEM FOR THEIR VOTE. I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THOSE STORIES, BUT I JUST WANT IT FAIR. I JUST WANT THE PERSON WHO GETS THE MOST VOTES LEGITIMATELY TO WIN-- I DO. I JUST DON'T WANT ANY CHEATING GOING ON, BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE TERRIBLE. THE VOTER FRAUD IS WHAT'S WORRYING ME. Man: I DON'T KNOW. KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. OH, I'M PRAYING. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. PRAYING AND FINGERS CROSSED AND RABBIT'S FOOT OR WHATEVER IT TAKES. FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS, MIKE HAS ALSO BEEN KEEPING HIS FINGERS CROSSED. TODAY HE GETS NEWS ABOUT THE ABSENTEE BALLOT LAWSUIT. I'M OUT HERE AT TEA CREEK BAPTIST CHURCH. NOW GO AHEAD, TELL ME AGAIN, START FROM THE BEGINNING. Man: Ronnie Bloemer called me and said that he had gotten a call from the judge; the plaintiff's petition is denied. That's what he said. OH! [CHUCKLES] SO CAN THEY APPEAL THAT, OR CAN THEY-- Oh, sure. Sure they can appeal it and then, you know, they probably will try and do that tomorrow morning. But the judge has ruled that it was frivolous and they shall pay defendants' attorney fees. [LAUGHS] There you go. All right, listen, I'll talk to you later. ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MAN. THANKS, BYE. OH, MY GOD. [PHONE BEEPS] [CHUCKLES] Woman: GENERAL ADMISSION TO YOUR LEFT! ["EYE OF THE TIGER" PLAYING ON LOUDSPEAKERS...] [CROWD CHEERS, APPLAUDS] [SONG CONTINUES] McCain: INDIANA IS NOW A BATTLEGROUND STATE, BUT IT'S A BATTLE THAT WE'RE GONNA WIN! WE'RE GONNA WIN THE BATTLE IN INDIANA! [CROWD CHEERS, APPLAUDS] NOW, I'M ASKING YOU, IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, VOLUNTEER, KNOCK ON DOORS, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS TO THE POLLS. I NEED YOUR VOTE! [CROWD CHEERS, APPLAUDS] OH, THE RALLY WAS FABULOUS. EVERYBODY WAS CHARGED UP AND I THINK WHAT SENATOR McCAIN SAID WAS PERFECT. INDIANA, YOU KNOW, HAS BECOME A BATTLEGROUND STATE BUT WE ARE GONNA WIN THE BATTLE. [CRICKETS CHIRPING...] FINALLY, THE SUN SETS ON THE MONTHS OF DOGGED LEGWORK, SKIRMISHES AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. AND THEN, ELECTION DAY. AT THE RIPLEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, GINGER BRADFORD, THE COUNTY CLERK, OPENS HER OFFICE. THIS IS THE KEYS TO UNLOCK THE, UH, YOUR BOXES OVER THERE WITH THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS IN IT. THERE IT IS. SO WE'VE GOT... TWO... LIKE A STAR WITNESS IN A MOB TRIAL, THE BALLOTS ARE BROUGHT OUT UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS. THERE YOU GO. O.K., I'LL SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. ALL RIGHT. Marshall: YEAH, WE WERE OUT ALL NIGHT. WE PUT UP A TON OF SIGNS. I JUST STOPPED AT HOME TO CHANGE CLOTHES AND BRUSH MY TEETH, PUT SOME DEODORANT ON. I SENT CLAYTON AND CAT BACK OUT. THEY'RE OUT RIGHT NOW. THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS ARRIVE AT THE POLLING CENTER FOR PROCESSING. THE PRECINCT CAPTAIN BRINGS THEM IN AND CONFIRMS THEY HAVE THE SAME NUMBER THAT THE CLERK'S OFFICE HAS ON RECORD. THEN OUT COMES THE TOUCHSCREEN VOTING MACHINE. ELECTRONIC MACHINES LIKE THIS WILL BE USED TODAY BY ALMOST ONE-THIRD OF ALL AMERICAN VOTERS. ...FOR AT LEAST A SHORT TIME AFTER THE 2000 ELECTION MESS IN PALM BEACH COUNTY, ELECTRONIC VOTING WAS SEEN AS THE SOLUTION. DID IT LIVE UP TO ITS PROMISE? THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF ADVANCEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE MOVE TO ELECTRONIC VOTING. IT'S MUCH MORE EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF COLLECTING DATA AND GETTING RESULTS QUICKLY TO THE PUBLIC. Man: LOADING ELECTION LOGGING STARTUP. IN ADDITION, THERE'S A LOT LESS AMBIGUITY AND A LOT LESS LOST VOTES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THE MOVE TO ELECTRONIC VOTING WAS THAT IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY AND IT WAS SEEN AS THIS PANACEA. SO IN 2002, CONGRESS PASSED THE "HELP AMERICA VOTE" ACT, INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND TOLD EVERYBODY YOU HAVE BASICALLY FOUR YEARS TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THE MACHINERY THAT YOU'RE USING FOR ELECTIONS. UM, NO PROCESSES IN PLACE, NO REAL TESTING STANDARDS FOR THESE MACHINES, SO THEY WEREN'T AS SECURE AND RELIABLE, I THINK, AS MANY HAD HOPED. WHEN I HEAR COMPUTER VOTING, I THINK "UH-OH, COULD SOMEONE HACK INTO THAT AND JUST THROW THE RESULTS COMPLETELY?" AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF VOTING SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY HAVE SOME KIND OF PAPER RECORD THAT CAN BE USED TO CHECK THE VOTING MACHINES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE RECORDING ACCURATELY. IF WE'RE DOING THAT, IT'S MUCH, MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO HACK INTO A SYSTEM. NOW, HAVING SAID THAT, THERE'S STILL A LOT THAT WE COULD BE DOING. THERE ARE 11 STATES IN THE U.S. WHERE THEIR VOTING SYSTEMS HAVE NO PAPER RECORD. THEY'RE TOUCHSCREEN MACHINES WITHOUT ANY PAPER TRAIL. I SEE THAT AS A SECURITY RISK. O.K., IT SAYS "INSERT CARD TO BEGIN VOTING." SO THIS ONE'S READY TO GO. CURRENTLY, MANY STATES FOLLOW VOLUNTARY VOTING SYSTEM GUIDELINES, BUT THERE'S STILL NO FEDERAL STANDARDIZATION. THE POLLS ARE NOW OPEN! WITH THOSE WORDS, MORE THAN 900 PRECINCTS ACROSS INDIANA OPENED THEIR DOORS. BY 10 A.M., THE ELECTIONEERING FOLKS WERE OUT MAKING THEIR 11th-HOUR SALES PITCHES. DO YOU NEED MY I.D., TOO? WE SURE DO. ALL RIGHT. I KNOW YOU KNOW ME. YEAH, I KNOW YOU. MRS. ATKINS SAW ME MISS THE BUS ABOUT 800 TIMES WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. Rocca: WELL, YEAH, BUT YOU COULD BE AN IMPERSONATOR. THAT'S TRUE. ALL RIGHT, DO YOU WANT PAPER OR TOUCH? PAPER, DEFINITELY. DO YOU NOT TRUST THE TOUCH SCREEN? I JUST PREFER PAPER. I WOULD MUCH-- I'D RATHER EVERYONE HAVE A PAPER BALLOT. DEE DEE FILLED IN A PAPER BALLOT, WHICH WAS THEN FED INTO AN OPTICAL SCANNER FOR PROCESSING. IT'S A BIG, BIG, BIG DEAL. I'M EXCITED AND I HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT TODAY. 57% OF AMERICANS USED THIS VOTING METHOD. THERE IT GOES. ALL RIGHT, WELL, CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WE'VE GOT TO GO OUT AND... [WHISPERS] CAMPAIGN. WE CAN'T DO THAT IN HERE, BUT WE'LL DO THAT THIS AFTERNOON. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. HOLD STILL. NO... [SMACK] OH! ALMOST GOT HIM. I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY. [BOTH LAUGH] IT WAS-- SERIOUSLY, I HAD IT LIKE, IT WAS RIGHT THERE. CENTRAL TO MIKE'S ELECTION-DAY OPERATION IS THIS POLLING BOOK-- A THICK TOME LISTING EVERY DEMOCRATIC VOTER IN JENNINGS COUNTY. FIRST NAME? WHEN A DEMOCRAT VOTES, HIS OR HER NAME IS CHECKED OFF A LIST. THEY'LL HAVE TO SEE YOUR I.D. UP THERE. THE NAME IS FORWARDED TO HEADQUARTERS, WHERE A TEAM OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS KEEPS A TALLY. THIS PROCESS OF ELIMINATION ALLOWS MIKE'S TEAM TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY WHICH JENNINGS COUNTY DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T VOTED YET. AND THAT'S HOW WE GO AFTER VOTERS AND MAKE SURE WE GET THE STRAGGLERS AND GET 'EM TO THE POLLS. AND THAT'S HOW WE WIN. Marshall: THE NUMBERS ARE HUGE. YEAH? HOW WE LOOKING? WE HAVEN'T GOT 'EM ALL IN, BUT EVERY PRECINCT THAT'S IN, THEY'RE HUGE. REALLY? THIS IS JUST UNHEARD OF AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING. I HAVEN'T HAD A RUSH LIKE THIS SINCE THE FIRST TIME I VOTED. REALLY? WHEN I WAS 18-- 1970. SO YOU WERE WORKING THE POLLS THE FIRST TIME YOU VOTED? YEAH, I WAS WORKING AS A POLLBOOK HOLDER. INSIDE OR OUTSIDE? OUTSIDE-- THEY MADE US STAND OUTSIDE. WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON YOU VOTED FOR? I VOTED STRAIGHT DEMOCRAT. YEAH? YEAH. I HEAR THAT GUY'S ALWAYS ON THE BALLOT. WITH EVERYONE WORKING SO HARD TO GET OUT THE VOTE, I THOUGHT I SHOULD PITCH IN A LITTLE. HEY, FLO! LET'S GO! FREE RIDE TO THE POLLS! ...YOU REMEMBER FLO, THE FORMER FELON WHO THOUGHT SHE'D BEEN BANNED FROM VOTING. ...ARE YOU HAPPY TO BE HERE? Flo: SURE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE BALLOT? I THINK IT'S WEIRD-LOOKING. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S MEANT BY THE STRAIGHT TICKET? YOU COMPLETE THE ARROW ON EITHER DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN OR LIBERTARIAN OR YOU CAN SPLIT YOUR VOTE, SUCH AS BARACK OBAMA AND THEN MITCH DANIELS. BARACK IS A DEMOCRAT AND MITCH DANIELS IS A REPUBLICAN. THAT'S SPLITTING YOUR TICKET. Rocca: I THINK SHE'S STILL CONFUSED ABOUT THIS WHOLE STRAIGHT-PARTY TICKET THING. I THINK IT'S CONFUSING. Man: IT'S A DESIGN MESS. A GIANT DESIGN MESS. THINKING THAT AMERICA'S BALLOTS MIGHT BENEFIT FROM A MAKEOVER, I ASKED NOTED DESIGNER TODD OLDHAM TO CRITIQUE AN ASSORTMENT FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. "TO VOTE, COMPLETE THE ARROW TO THE LEFT OF YOUR CHOICE LIKE THIS. TO CAST A WRITE-IN VOTE, COMPLETE THE ARROW TO THE LEFT OF THE BLANK..." SEE, I'M ALREADY CONFUSED. "FOR SPECIAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE CARD OF INSTRUC..." [MUTTERING] THIS IS A HUNK OF LIKE, WORD GARBAGE RIGHT THERE. AND HOW NOT INTUITIVE IS THIS? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ASKED TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN TWO ARROWS? Rocca: IT'S LIKE A WEIRD DRUNK DRIVING TEST. [LAUGHS] YEAH, IT IS. LIKE, CAN YOU DRAW THE LINE STRAIGHT? I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS EVER, IN ANYTHING. THIS IS JUST DOWNRIGHT BIZARRE. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, APPARENTLY, WAS THOSE VOTING FOR EITHER DICK DURBIN OR JIM DURKIN-- DURBIN WON THE RACE-- COMPLETED THE ARROW TO THE RIGHT. MM-HMM. ARROWS SUGGEST FORWARD MOVEMENT OR, YOU KNOW, SOME TRAJECTORY BASED ON THE POINT OF THE ARROW, SO, UH, IT'S POINTING ME IN THAT DIRECTION. THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S PUSHING MY EYE TO THE RIGHT. YEAH, IT'S TELLING YOU TO MAKE YOUR DECISION AND MARK IT HERE. IT'S NOT TELLING YOU TO REVERT IN THE WAY THAT THE BOX WOULD. IT'S JUST AWFUL COMMUNICATION. IT REALLY MAKES YOU WONDER IF THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER MOTIVE BEHIND THIS. AND THEN, THIS ONE I DON'T EVEN NEED TO GIVE YOU ANY SORT OF PREFACE TO... YEAH-- GOOD OLD 2000. THIS ONE KIND OF WRECKED THE WORLD, DIDN'T IT? CAN YOU BEGIN TO ENUMERATE THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS? WE'LL GO WITH JUST WHAT'S NATURALLY COUNTER-INTUITIVE HERE. AND IT'S, WE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER, WHICH IS LEFT-- ACTIVATING LEFT, ACTIVATING RIGHT. THIS IS NOT WITHIN OUR MINDSET AT ALL. THEN THESE THINGS SLID DOWN BEHIND IT AND WERE PUNCTURED. WELL, YOU CAN SEE IMMEDIATELY THAT THEY DON'T PROPERLY LINE UP. THE SPACING BETWEEN THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SPACING BETWEEN THESE BANNERS HERE. YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. PLUS THIS IS 2000! I WOULD BELIEVE THIS FROM 1942 OR SOMETHING. IT'S LIKE AN ADVENT CALENDAR OR SOMETHING, OR LIKE A-- AND I LOVE AN ADVENT CALENDAR, BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT DECIDING WHO'S PRESIDENT. AND IT SAYS, "VOTE FOR GROUP." "GROUP" TELLS YOU TO VOTE TWICE. AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE THAT SAYS TO PUNCH ONLY ONE HOLE. WE NEED A THIRD SET OF PARENTHESES. YOU'RE RIGHT. ...I GOT HIS POINT. PALM BEACH COUNTY TOSSED OUT MORE THAN 6600 DOUBLE-PUNCHES FOR AL GORE AND ANOTHER CANDIDATE. AND THE ELECTION WAS DECIDED BY 537 VOTES STATEWIDE. SO, I THINK WHAT'S SCARY IS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF DESIGN AND THE FACT THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO BE IN CHARGE. HOW COME THERE'S NOT A NATIONAL CONSISTENCY FOR THESE THINGS? I THINK BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT SHOULD REMAIN IN LOCAL CONTROL. ...NATIONAL CONSISTENCY MIGHT SEEM UNATTAINABLE, AT LEAST HERE IN THE U.S. BUT THERE'S A PLACE NOT SO FAR AWAY WHERE THEY'VE FIGURED OUT A LOT OF THIS. CANADA HAS HAD ONE NATIONAL BALLOT DESIGN FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS. YOU MARK IT WITH AN X IN THE WHITE DOT. COAST TO COAST, NEWFOUNDLAND TO VANCOUVER AND NORTH TO SOUTH. GOOD AFTERNOON, ELECTIONS CANADA, WILLOWDALE. THEY'VE ALSO TAKEN THE PARTISAN RANCOR OUT OF VOTING BY ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION THAT OVERSEES ALL ELECTIONS. Man: YOU'VE GOT TO REACH OUT TO THE PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE REASONS FOR WHICH THEY DON'T VOTE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM. EITHER WAY? YES. DOES IT SHRED THEM AS IT GOES THROUGH? NO, MA'AM. SO AT THE AGE OF 50, FLO PERKINS JOINED 15 MILLION OTHER AMERICANS WHO CAST BALLOTS FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS DAY. NICE. BEN? YEAH, WHAT'S THE LATEST? AS THE AFTERNOON WORE ON, MIKE AND HIS CREW STAYED VIGILANT, PUSHING JUST AS HARD AT 4 P.M. AS THEY HAD BEEN AT 10 A.M. HOW MANY BALLOTS DID THEY TRY TO THROW OUT? HOW MANY DID THEY THROW OUT? THREE? DO YOU HAVE THE NAMES? Marshall: WHAT PRECINCT? SPENCER SOUTH. BEN SAID, "I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO KNOW." [LAUGHS] Marshall: NO SIGNATURE, THAT'S NOT A RED FLAG. NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. O.K., LET ME-- CALL ME BACK IF YOU GET ANYBODY ELSE. O.K., THANKS, BEN, BYE. BOY, THOSE KIDS. I WANT THESE KIDS AS POLL WATCHERS EVERY YEAR. SAMUEL DID NOT HAVE A SIGNATURE, THEY'RE SAYING NINA LOUISE HAUSBERGER AND JACOB TRIMPE DID NOT-- THEIR SIGNATURES DID NOT MATCH. SHE LIVES A QUARTER-MILE SOUTH OF THE POLLS. LET'S GO. Marshall: GET HER ON THE PHONE, JUST CALL 'EM, TELL 'EM TO GO TO THE POLLS. DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATES FOR THE CITIES? HERE'S 3B. I NEED GENEVA ONE EAST. WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT AT THE POLLING PLACE, THEY THREW OUT YOUR ABSENTEE BALLOT BECAUSE THEY CLAIMED YOUR SIGNATURE DIDN'T MATCH WITH THE APPLICATION. SO YOU HAVE UNTIL 6:00 TO GO DOWN THERE AND GET IN LINE. IF YOU'RE IN LINE AT 6:00, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO VOTE AND THAT VOTE WILL COUNT. AND YOU MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR PHOTO I.D. WITH YOU, YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE WITH YOU, NINA. THANK YOU-- BYE. [LOUD SMACK] YEAH... BACK AT THE RIPLEY COUNTY POLLING CENTER, DEE DEE WAS SWEATING OUT THE LAST FEW HOURS. I AM HOT! IT'S JUST HOT OUT HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. HOW YOU DOIN' TODAY? GOOD TO SEE YOU-- YOU'RE HERE FOR THE McCAIN STUFF, RIGHT? YUP, PICK IT UP AND I'LL TAKE IT OVER TO MILAN. GOOD DEAL. O.K., LET'S SEE. IS THAT ENOUGH, YOU THINK? YEAH, THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. IS THAT TOO MUCH? NO, THAT'LL BE PLENTY. YEAH, I THINK FOR MILAN THAT'D BE A GOOD AMOUNT. YEAH, I JUST CAME BACK FROM OVER THERE AND THEY HAD A PRETTY GOOD TURNOUT OVER THERE. GOOD-- I THINK IT'S BEEN A GOOD TURNOUT EVERYWHERE. YEAH, IT IS, REALLY. WELL, HEY, THANKS FOR PASSING THAT OUT FOR SENATOR McCAIN AND WE'LL KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED. GO RED, INDIANA! YEP-- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE. BYE-BYE. THANKS. HE'S GOTTA WIN INDIANA. IF WE DON'T WIN INDIANA, I THINK THAT IS-- IT'S A BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD SIGN. OUTSIDE THE POLLING CENTER, I CAUGHT UP WITH LARRY SHICKLES, THE MAN WHO SUED AND LOST OVER THE JENNINGS COUNTY DEMOCRATIC ABSENTEE BALLOTS. THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE VOTED WHO ARE NOT LEGITIMATELY REGISTERED VOTERS. I MEAN, WE'VE HEARD OF MICKEY MOUSE BEING REGISTERED AND DUMBO IN OTHER STATES-- I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM HERE. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS IN THE 2006 ELECTION THAT IN JENNINGS COUNTY THAT THERE PARTICULARLY WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO COLLECTED THE BALLOTS, TOOK THEM TO A CENTRAL LOCATION AND SAT DOWN ONE NIGHT AND VOTED THEM, PUT THEM IN AN ENVELOPE-- THE ACTUAL BALLOTS? NOT THE APPLICATIONS? THE ACTUAL BALLOTS. VOTED THOSE BALLOTS, DROPPED THEM IN THE MAIL. BUT YOU CAN'T VERIFY THAT. I MEAN, I'M TELLING YOU THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE CALLED AND SAID, BUT THE JUDGE PROHIBITED US FROM VERIFYING THOSE UNTIL THE ELECTION'S OVER. AND LET ME SAY THAT JENNINGS COUNTY IS GOING TO GO ON FOR SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS. WE'VE ONLY BEGUN. 5:40 P.M. MIKE'S TEAM WAS FOCUSED ON WRINGING OUT EVERY LAST POSSIBLE VOTE FROM THOSE WHO WERE REGISTERED. [KNOCKING...] IS THERE ANYBODY YOU KNOW THAT HASN'T VOTED RIGHT NOW THAT WE NEED TO DRAG OUT? Marshall: YOU KNOW WHERE LITTLE GEORGIE IS? HE MOVED. WHERE'D HE GO? HE'S ALREADY VOTED. ALL RIGHT, ANYBODY ELSE? ANYBODY ELSE SITTING AT HOME RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO DRAG OUT? Marshall: JUSTIN HAD AN ABSENTEE, BUT HE DIDN'T MAIL IT BACK. I KNOW IT. BUT IF WE COULD FIND HIM, WE COULD GET HIM IN THERE BY 6. HE'S ON STATE STREET, DOWN IN THE LITTLE APARTMENT. I'VE BEEN THERE SIX TIMES, FOUR LAST NIGHT, AND-- WELL, ONE TODAY AND FIVE LAST NIGHT. WHAT'S THE LATEST HE CAN VOTE TONIGHT? 6:00-- 15, 20 MINUTES. OH NO. YOU CAN'T GET A HOLD OF HIM? CAN'T GET A HOLD OF HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S AT. WE NEED THAT VOTE! I KNOW WE DO. WE CAN'T FIND HIM. [♪...] AS THE CLOCK TICKED DOWN, IT OCCURRED TO ME: DID THESE VOTERS REALLY KNOW WHO THEY WERE VOTING FOR? CERTAINLY NOT THE PRESIDENT. INSTEAD THEY'RE VOTING FOR EITHER BEN LEATHERBURY OR DAVID BUSKILL, OUR DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN ELECTORS. THIS WAS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA DESERVED TO KNOW. ...FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, DID YOU CAST YOUR BALLOT FOR DAVID OR FOR BEN? FOR DAVID OR FOR BEN? OH, GEE, I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT DAVID OR BEN. YOU'RE VOTING FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY VOTE FOR YOUR CANDIDATE, SO... I DON'T KNOW. AND YOU'RE AWARE THAT HE'S ONE OF THE ELECTORS? YEAH. ACTUALLY, NO. SO YOU ENDED UP CASTING YOUR VOTE FOR... FOR BEN. AND 10 OTHER OBAMA ELECTORS? YES. SO THAT ON DECEMBER 15, THEY CAN... VOTE FOR BARACK OBAMA. AND THAT MAKES SENSE? YES. REALLY? NO-- NOT AT ALL. AS IT HAPPENS, MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHO DAVID AND BEN WERE OR OF THE ROLE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE PLAYS IN SHAPING THE CANDIDATES' STRATEGY. THEY JUST WANTED TO VOTE. [BELL CHIMES IN DISTANCE] OH, HEAR THAT BELL? All: HEAR YE! HEAR YE! THE POLLS ARE NOW CLOSED! [LAUGHING] Woman: YES, THEY CAN START TAKING SIGNS DOWN. GARY CATNER, PATRICIA CATNER, KENNETH COHEN, RIPLEY COOK... [TAPPING ON DOOR] Man: COME IN. DANNY, IS THAT SOME OF OUR WORKERS FROM THE CHURCH? Man: I WAS JUST OVER AT CROSS PLAINS AND THEY TOLD ME I COULDN'T VOTE OVER THERE. I HAD TO COME OVER HERE AND I VOTED OVER THERE THE LAST THREE TIMES. YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN. I'M MAD. WHY CAN'T I VOTE RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE? YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN AND QUIT YELLING. I DON'T CARE. IT AIN'T RIGHT! IT'S NOT OUR FAULT! WHY COULDN'T I VOTE OVER THERE? YOU WERE NOT REGISTERED FOR THAT PRECINCT. ALL I WANT TO DO IS VOTE. THE POLLS ARE CLOSED NOW. I'VE BEEN OVER THERE FOR THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, I'M OVER HERE. EVIDENTLY YOU DID A CHANGE OF REGISTRATION TO BE VOTING UP HERE. I DID NOT DO NO CHANGE OF REGISTRATION. NOBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE IT. Officer: HAVE A NICE EVENING. YOU TOO-- BYE. [DOOR SHUTS] WELL, IT'S THE WEE, WEE LATE HOUR OF 6 P.M. AND THE POLLS ARE CLOSED ALL ACROSS INDIANA. NOW IT'S TIME TO TABULATE THE VOTES. IN RIPLEY COUNTY, THE RESULTS WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPLAYED TO THE PUBLIC AS THEY WERE CALCULATED. O.K., LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE. 100% YAY! MORRIS, WHOO-HOO! 6,552 TO 5,465. 54-45. WE'LL TAKE IT. GOT TO LOVE IT, YES! [WOMAN LAUGHS] THE REPUBLICANS WERE DOING WELL IN MANY LOCAL RACES. BUT MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES WERE HOLDING THEIR BREATH FOR THE BIG ONE. [PEOPLE CHEER, APPLAUD] AT JENNINGS COUNTY DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS, A CROWD WAS GATHERING TO WATCH THE FIRST ELECTION RETURNS. 1A! Rocca: SO WHAT'S THE MOOD HERE? Woman: WONDERFUL. VERY HAPPY. IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE THINGS TO COME IN, YEAH? YEAH, YEAH, AND YOU KNOW, IT'S AWFULLY HARD TO WAIT. IT'S VERY HARD TO WAIT. DO YOU WISH IT WERE COMPUTERIZED? THAT WOULD BE NICE. IT WOULD. OVER IN RIPLEY COUNTY, THEY HAVE THAT. OH, IS IT REALLY? OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT! 134 TO 115. [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] THE ROOM WOULD BE PACKED FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS AS RESULTS CAME IN. EVEN OUTSIDE IT WAS STANDING-ROOM ONLY. OBAMA JUST WON PENNSYLVANIA. Woman: OBAMA WON PENNSYLVANIA! Woman 2: OBAMA WON PENNSYLVANIA! AND THE REST, AS THEY SAY, IS HISTORY. [DRAMATIC DRUMMING] AND CNN CAN NOW PROJECT THAT BARACK OBAMA, 47 YEARS OLD, WILL BECOME THE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] HELLO, CHICAGO! [LOUDER CHEERING] [♪...] SO IT CAME TO BE THAT NEARLY 67 MILLION AMERICANS CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR BARACK OBAMA. THE PEOPLE, OR AT LEAST THOSE WHO'D MANAGED TO REGISTER AND VOTE, HAD SPOKEN. AT 61% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS, IT WAS THE HIGHEST TURNOUT SINCE 1964. AND NOW IT WAS TIME FOR THE REAL ELECTION. ...WELL, THE BIG DAY HAS ARRIVED. THE FIRST MONDAY AFTER THE SECOND WEDNESDAY IN DECEMBER. ELECTION DAY. AND THAT'S WHY I'VE COME HERE, TO THE INDIANA STATE CAPITOL. Man: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS THEY COME FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM, PLEASE WELCOME INDIANA'S ELECTORS AND THE ALTERNATE ELECTORS. [APPLAUSE] I WAS HERE FOR THE CONVENING OF INDIANA'S DELEGATION TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. TODD, ARE WE GONNA NEED A PHOTO I.D.? [LAUGHTER] Man: GOOD QUESTION. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE, WHISTLES] WITH ALL THE POMP, CIRCUMSTANCE AND POINTED BARBS ASIDE, 19-YEAR-OLD BEN LEATHERBURY AND THE 10 OTHER DEMOCRAT ELECTORS CAST THEIR HISTORIC VOTES. Man: IF I CAN HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? I AM INFORMED BY THE ELECTION DIVISION THAT 11 VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST AND TABULATED AND ALL 11 VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST FOR BARACK OBAMA. [APPLAUSE] WITH NEARLY THREE MILLION VOTES CAST IN INDIANA, BARACK OBAMA WOUND UP WITH A ONE PERCENT LEAD, ENTITLING HIM TO ALL OF THE STATE'S 11 ELECTORAL VOTES. WHILE IT WORKED OUT FOR HIM, I WONDERED IF THIS ELECTORAL COLLEGE APPROACH WAS THE BEST WAY FOR THE WORLD'S GREATEST DEMOCRACY TO CHOOSE ITS MOST IMPORTANT ELECTED OFFICIAL. Raskin: MOST AMERICANS LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING A POPULAR VOTE FOR PRESIDENT AND THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE LEGISLATION IS THE SINGLE MOST PROMISING AVENUE WE'VE GOT TO BREAK FROM THE BIZARRENESS OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BECAUSE IT WILL MEAN THAT THE WINNER OF THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE WILL GET ALL OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES OR CERTAINLY ALL THE ELECTORAL VOTES OF THE STATES PARTICIPATING. CURRENTLY, EVERY STATE EXCEPT TWO AWARDS ALL ITS ELECTORAL VOTES TO THE WINNER OF ITS POPULAR VOTE, CREATING RED AND BLUE STATES. BUT WITH THE NEW LEGISLATION, EACH STATE WILL AWARD ITS ELECTORS TO THE WINNER OF THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE. THIS LEGISLATION WILL ONLY GO INTO EFFECT WHEN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ELECTORS AVAILABLE FROM PARTICIPATING STATES REACHES 270: THE MAGIC NUMBER NEEDED TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY. WE ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES THAT WE'RE HALFWAY THERE IN TERMS OF THE 270 WE NEED IN ORDER TO GET US TO NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE, SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION. AND I THINK THAT THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE CAMPAIGN IS THE BRIDGE TO GETTING US TO A DIRECT ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT, WHICH YOU KNOW, WILL JUST HAVE US CATCHING UP WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. THERE HAVE BEEN MORE BILLS IN CONGRESS TO ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE THAN ON ANY OTHER ISSUE. AND IT'S NOT A PARTISAN CAUSE. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON SUPPORTED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ABOLISH IT. WHOEVER WINS THE POPULAR VOTE SHOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. TOM TANCREDO IS NO PROGRESSIVE, REMEMBER. HE'S THE GUY WHO WANTS US ALL TO TAKE A TEST BEFORE WE VOTE. WHY ARE YOU SUPPORTING THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE INITIATIVE? WELL, I'VE SEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM. I WAS IN CONGRESS WHEN THIS FELLOW PUSHED SOMETHING CALLED THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN AND IT WAS THE WORST PIECE OF LEGISLATION I HAVE EVER HAD TO SIT THROUGH AND IT WAS THE MOST HEAVILY LOBBIED I HAVE EVER SEEN-- AND WHAT DID IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE? YES, I'LL TELL YOU, IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. ALL ABOUT GETTING HIM THE ELECTORAL VOTES OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. EVERYBODY KNEW WHY WE WERE DOING THIS. THAT'S WHY THEY COULDN'T GET THE VOTES. I MEAN, MOST REPUBLICANS WEREN'T GOING TO GO ALONG WITH IT, NO MATTER WHAT. BUT EVENTUALLY, HE GOT ENOUGH PEOPLE AND THEY PASSED IT. WE DID ALL OF THAT, A TRILLION-DOLLAR BILL, FOR THE ELECTORAL VOTES OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. EVEN THOUGH I FOUND LIBERALS AND SOME CONSERVATIVES AGREEING THAT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS ANTIQUATED, OLD-FANGLED, I KNEW ONE GROUP IN 2008 THAT WAS HAPPY FOR THE WINNER OF INDIANA'S 11 ELECTORAL VOTES. WHO LOVES LIVING IN A BLUE STATE? [APPLAUSE] Rocca: ALL RIGHT, BUT WAIT A MINUTE-- WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ALL DID ON THE GROUND THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE? WHAT WAS WITHIN YOUR CONTROL? I THINK THE ABSENTEES ARE OUR MARGIN OF VICTORY FOR OUR CANDIDATES. OVER 55% OF THE WORKING WORKFORCE IN JENNINGS COUNTY HAS TO DRIVE OUTSIDE OF JENNINGS COUNTY TO WORK AND THE AVERAGE OF THOSE 55% WORK 10-HOUR SHIFTS. SO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO VOTE AND WE, IN THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS ANYWAY, HAVE EDUCATED THE PUBLIC THAT YES, YOU CAN VOTE ABSENTEE. 'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REALIZE YOU CAN VOTE BY MAIL. JUST TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, YOU DIDN'T TO HAVE A PHOTO I.D. FOR THE ABSENTEE BALLOT? I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE INCREASED INTEREST IS THAT SO MANY OLDER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE, THEY CAN'T FIND A BIRTH CERTIFICATE, YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY ARE LEFT WITH NO OTHER CHOICE. AND A LOT OF OUR ABSENTEES ARE ELDERLY. A LOT OF THEM ARE. Marshall: AND THE REPUBLICANS ALWAYS WANT TO SAY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ABSENTEES BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST SO MANY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH VOTING ABSENTEE, IT'S A VOTE. YOU ONLY GET TO VOTE ONCE. YOU SCARED THEM. I CAN SAY THAT FLAT OUT. YOU HAVE SCARED THEM. Woman: I AGREE. YEP. AFTER THE 2008 ELECTION, MIKE MARSHALL CONTINUED WORKING ON CAMPAIGNS AND GETTING OUT THE VOTE IN INDIANA. I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST AWESOME. I MEAN, YOU ARE JUST A SOLDIER THERE, YOU KNOW, WATCHING THE VOTER FRAUD-- DEE DEE BENKIE BEGAN A STINT AT FOX NEWS, APPEARING AS A COMMENTATOR ON SEVERAL PROGRAMS. THEN, IN 2011, THE CONTROVERSY OVER ABSENTEE BALLOT APPLICATIONS RESURFACED. Newscaster: INDIANA STATE POLICE SAY THE INVESTIGATION INTO FORMER CAMPAIGN WORKER MIKE MARSHALL BEGAN MONTHS AGO AND STEMMED FROM ALLEGED VOTER FRAUD ISSUES REGARDING ABSENTEE BALLOT APPLICATIONS. ON FRIDAY, MARSHALL WAS INDICTED BY A JENNINGS COUNTY GRAND JURY WHO ISSUED 66 INDICTMENTS. MAYOR GALLIGAN SAYS IT'S HIS UNDERSTANDING THE INDICTMENT STEMS FROM THREE ABSENTEE BALLOT APPLICATIONS. I THINK THIS IS POLITICAL RETRIBUTION AND IT'S JUST THE WAY POLITICS IS IN THIS DAY AND TIME. [♪...] MIKE WAS INDICTED ON 45 COUNTS OF FORGERY, PERJURY AND VOTER FRAUD. HIS TRIAL IS SET TO BEGIN LATE IN 2012. IF CONVICTED, HE FACES LIFE IN PRISON. [♪...] BECAUSE OF THE PENDING LITIGATION, MIKE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH ME. BUT AS BOTH SIDES PREPARED THEIR CASES, I TALKED WITH SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES. Woman: I THINK PEOPLE DO GET VICIOUS ABOUT VOTING-- PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T SEE THE VICIOUS SIDE OF TALKING ABOUT OTHER TOPICS, BUT YOU DO SEE A WARLIKE ATTITUDE WHEN VOTER RIGHTS AND VOTER SUPPRESSION IS BEING DISCUSSED. Man: SHE WAS SHOCKED; I WAS NOT SHOCKED, BECAUSE... YOU SAW IT COMING? I KNEW-- IT'S LIKE I SAID, HE'S SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT HE DOES, HE WEARS A TARGET-- THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO TAKE HIM DOWN. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. SOMEONE ASKED THE QUESTION: WHY ARE THERE SO MANY INDICTMENTS? Rocca: RIGHT. IT'S A LOT. THEY SAID, "WE HAVE TO CHARGE A LOT BECAUSE PROBABLY MOST OF THEM WON'T STICK AND WE'RE HOPING SOME OF THEM WILL SLIDE BY." THAT TELLS YOU RIGHT THERE, "WE HAVE NOTHING." IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH STEAMROLLING PEOPLE, I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THEIR FIRST LESSONS IS GONNA BE MIKE MARSHALL AND HOW THIS COMMUNITY STEPS UP TO BACK HIM UP. AND THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT THAT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY DOESN'T THINK THE WAY THEY DO. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY THINKS EVERYBODY GETS A RIGHT TO VOTE AND THAT THAT MATTERS, BECAUSE WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHEN SOMEBODY WHO HELPS OTHER PEOPLE VOTE, ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS, IS BEING ATTACKED BY THEIR POLITICAL OPPOSITION? DEFINITELY RETRIBUTION. Rocca: IF MIKE MARSHALL IS SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL? Benkie: TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. IT'D BE TRAGIC. I HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. I'M EMPATHETIC TO FOLKS THAT, YOU KNOW, MAKE MISTAKES. AND I'M NOT SAYING MIKE DID. I JUST FEEL BAD WHENEVER, PERHAPS, LAWS ARE SO MURKY AND THINGS ARE SO DIFFERENT THAT IT CAN MAYBE GET MESSED UP, WHETHER IT'S INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL. THAT'S WHY I'M SO ADAMANT ABOUT VOTER I.D. AND ABOUT ABSENTEE BALLOTS BEING ACCURATE AND THAT WE HAVE STANDARDIZED VOTER I.D. LAWS AND THAT WE NEED TO DEFINITELY GET OUR ACT TOGETHER NATIONWIDE AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS HODGEPODGE ALL OVER THE PLACE-- IT'S TOO CONFUSING. Browne-Dianis: INDIANA STARTED THE BALL ROLLING ON VOTER I.D. RESTRICTIONS. THEY WERE ONE OF THE FIRST TO PASS THE MOST RESTRICTIVE I.D. LAWS AND NOW WE'RE SEEING IT SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE PHRASE "WAR ON VOTING," DO YOU THINK THAT'S HYPERBOLIC OR DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE? I THINK "WAR ON VOTING" IS A TOTALLY APPROPRIATE PHRASE FOR RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A MOVE IN THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT EVERYBODY GETS TO VOTE, AND... THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE VOTE. THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE VOTE. AND THE SO-CALLED WRONG PEOPLE DON'T GET TO VOTE. IT IS TIME TO ASK, WHAT KIND OF NATION DO WE WANT TO BE? ARE WE WILLING TO ALLOW THIS ERA, OUR ERA, TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE AGE WHEN OUR NATION'S PROUD TRADITION OF EXPANDING THE FRANCHISE ENDED? ENSURING THAT EVERY VETERAN, EVERY SENIOR, EVERY COLLEGE STUDENT, EVERY ELIGIBLE CITIZEN HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE MUST BECOME OUR COMMON CAUSE. AND FOR ALL AMERICANS, PROTECTING THIS RIGHT, ENSURING MEANINGFUL ACCESS AND COMBATING DISCRIMINATION MUST BE VIEWED NOT ONLY AS A LEGAL ISSUE, BUT AS A MORAL IMPERATIVE. [♪...] IT'S SAD TO THINK THAT IN THIS GREAT DEMOCRACY, WE STILL FIND OURSELVES BATTLING OVER VOTING. DO WE REALLY NOT AGREE THAT ALL LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS DESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE? THERE MUST BE SOME COMMON GROUND. ...AMERICANS HATE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO. SO WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES WITH DIFFERENT REGISTRATION DEADLINES, BALLOT DESIGNS, POLLING HOURS, MACHINES WE VOTE ON, I.D. REQUIREMENTS? WHEN IT COMES TO CHOOSING A PRESIDENT, SHOULD THE CANDIDATE WHO GETS THE MOST VOTES WIN, AS IN EVERY OTHER ELECTION? SHOULD THE CONSTITUTION BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE A RIGHT TO VOTE? OH, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DID MY CLASSROOM DEMONSTRATION PERMANENTLY SCAR THOSE CHILDREN? [CHILDREN LAUGHING, YELLING] WELL, I AM SURE ABOUT ONE THING: VOTING MATTERS. SO IF YOU THINK OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM IS BROKEN, THAT IT'S OVERLY COMPLICATED, PRONE TO MELTDOWNS, DON'T LOOK FOR A LITTLE BLUE PILL TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE KEY TO FIXING ELECTORAL DYSFUNCTION... IS VOTING. I LOVE IT WHEN A DOCUMENTARY ENDS ON A NOTE OF IRONY.
