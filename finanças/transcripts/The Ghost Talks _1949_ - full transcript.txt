[♪] [THUNDER CLAPS] [WIND WHISTLING] So this is smorgasbord castle. Light some candles. Shemp, come on. SHEMP: I'm coming. This joint gives me the creeps. Uh-oh. MOE: Hey, Shemp, come on. All right. How do you like that? It's stuck. [GRUNTING] Quit stalling. Hold your horses. What are you stalling about? You know we got furniture to move. I can't help it. My umbrella won't close. You're just a dumbbell. Give it to me. I'll close it. [SHEMP LAUGHS] Wise guy. So you got a shower, eh? Why, I... Oh! Cut out the clowning. We got work to do. The sooner we get out of this spooky joint, the better I'll like it. [CREAKING] [WHIMPERS, SNORTS] [SLAMS] W-What was that? Why, that was-- Why, that was the creaky door. Hello, everybody. This is Desmond of the outer sanctorum. Strange things will happen in this mysterious castle. [CACKLES] Who could get along without a nice, bloody murder, hm? Yes. There will be strange happenings. [CACKLES] [SCREAMS] [BANG] [GROANS] What happened? Strange happenings. That's strange. Come on. Oh, oh, oh. Ow, ow, ow. [THUNDER CRASHES] I hate this castle. People said it was haunted. Ah, go on. There's no such thing as haunted houses and spooks. That was just a coincidence. Who does this belong to? [WIND WHISTLES] [TWANG] Yow! What happened? Just a coincidence. Fellas, let's get started. I got the list of the stuff we're supposed to move away. Yeah, here. An antique table and chairs, a mahogany chest, and a suit of medieval armor. [BANG] [CRASH] Well, let's see. Thank you. What are you thanking me for? I wasn't thanking you for anything. Then why was you thanking me? I didn't say a word. But I did. Why didn't you say so when I first asked you? I didn't say anything. One of us is nuts, and it can't be you. Right. [CHUCKLES] Keep your big mouth shut. Just a minute. People have a right to talk, you know. Oh, a wise guy, eh? Ooh! Let him alone. Now, listen. We gotta get busy. You help me get the table over to the truck. You take the armor. Come on. All right. Please don't take me away. I beg of you. Put me down. I beseech you. Ahhhh! [CRASH] Ow! Ah. How do you like that lazy? Fine time to take a nap. Get up out of here. Look, Moe. Look, Moe, Moe, I'm telling ya. Never mind. Go on, help Larry. I'll take the armor. Nitwit. Up you go. There we are. Thank you. You are a gentleman. Oh, think nothing of it, I-- That's funny. For a minute, I thought that armor spoke to me. I did. [YELPS] Hey, fellas. That suit of armor, it's haunted. It just spoke to me. It spoke to me too. Ah, you're goofy. Honest, Larry. It just spoke to me. Yeah. Ah, you fraidy-cats. I'll take care of this. Armor talking. If you got something to say, say it now before I dump you in the truck. You guys must be dreaming. Or maybe he don't talk English. Parlez-vous Francais? Oui, oui, monsieur. Spaten zee Irish? Hootman. Ah, you see. He don't talk English. [YELPING] Hey, fellas. Take it easy. We'll get you out. Hurry up. Heave. Ho. [GRUNTING] Are you okay? Yeah. Wait a minute. You're right. That armor is haunted. It just spoke to me too. Hey, it can't be possible. Things like this just don't happen. Shemp, I think you better go get the armor. Moe, I think you better go get the armor. Wait a minute. I think we all better go get the armor. Let's not be afraid. Come on. Go ahead. Have no fear, gentlemen. I am a friendly spirit. Come closer. It's empty. [TAP, TAP] [CLANK, CLANK] [TAP, TAP-TAP, TAP...] [...CLANK, CLANK] [TAPPING] Oop. There goes my quarter. [CLANGING] [GEARS GRINDING] MOE: Wait a minute. All right. Step aside. You're really a friendly spirit. Give. Ooh! What did you say your name was? I am the spirit of peeping Tom. I was accused of peeping through the shadows when Lady Godiva made her famous ride through Coventry. But I didn't do it. I swear I didn't do it purposely. Take it easy, pal. Calm yourself. Here, have a smoke. [COUGHING] Sorry, gentlemen. I haven't had-- [COUGHS] --a smoke in a thousand years. Think you're old enough to smoke? [CHUCKLES] [HONK] Quiet. I don't get this. What is it all about? It's this way. In the days of old, I was a tailor. Oh, old Taylor. [BOP] Quiet. Yes, yes. Go on. You see, Lady Godiva and I were sweethearts. We were going to be married. Then came that famous day and year-- When he said to his friends, "If the British march, hang a-- Hang a..." I'll hang one. Yes, yes. Go on. Well, we were told to close our shutters tight. Every shutter in the city was shuttered, including mine. I was seated in my tailor shop by the shuttered window, sewing. My needle had run out of thread, and in the darkened room I could not see to rethread it. Forgetfully, I stepped to the window and opened the shutter to give me light so I could thread my needle. Suddenly, there were cheers and yells. Inadvertently, I turned to the window to see what the shouting was about. [POW] That shutter, that confounded shutter. I shudder to think of it. [CHUCKLES] [BEEP] Ooh! Shutter up. Oh, I don't have to. Nah. What did you say? I don't have to. Nah. [SIZZLE] Now be quiet. I'm sorry. Then what happened? I was beheaded and my spirit imprisoned in this suit of armor for 1000 years. Today, my time is up, and the spirit of Lady Godiva will meet me. [COWERS] That does it. Go out to the truck and get that bottle. I gotta have a drink. Me too. Me three. Make it four. I still think I'm dreaming. See if I'm awake. [BOING] [YELPS] You're awake. Yes, but you won't be for long. Come here. Look out. [MUSICAL SCALE] Oh, oh, oh. LARRY: Spread out, you guys. I got the bottle. Oh, boy. Start pouring. Okay. Down the hatchet. Hurray. Brruump! Why don't you watch your manners? Barrummp! Hey, cut it out. Aww. [ALL SLURPING] [MECHANIC SLURPING NOISES] Now, this is all very well, Tom, but we got orders to move all the junk out of here, including you. Gentlemen, I warn you, if you take me, bad luck will pursue you. Heed my warning. Somebody's playing jokes on us. This ain't possible. Yeah, you get the rest of the stuff. I'll take this tin can out. There's the, uh-- [BANGING] Ooh, ooh, ooh! Uh-oh, bad luck is beginning to start. Oh, fiddlesticks. I'm fed up with spooks. MOE: So am I. Come on, let's get this junk out of here. Go ahead. I gotta get my hat. Go ahead. MOE: Hey, Shemp, come on. Hold your horses, will ya? Oh? Oh? Oh, tricks, eh? Wise guy, eh? You can make this hat jump till doomsday, but you won't frighten me again. I'm through being scared of your phony spooky business. Ha-ha-ha-- [YELPING] What's wrong with you now? That bad luck was down my back biting me. It was scratching me to death. Six lions were tearing me apart bit by bit. Six lions. Quit lyin'. You're only stalling. Go on. Get busy. MOE: Go ahead. We'll take this chest first. Get on it. Heave. Heave. It's too heavy. We'll have to take it piecemeal. Take the junk off the top, and I'll take the drawers. Hurry up. [GROANS] STOOGES: Ahhh! Greetings, gents. I said, "greetings," that is. W-W-Who are you? Me? I'm Red. Oh, a red skeleton. Catch. [SHUDDERS] Boy, am I glad he's gone. I-- Aah! Ow! Ow! Eeeh! Don't be afraid now, boys. But let's get out of here! Yeah! Wait a minute, fellas. That spirit locked us in. Hold it. I'll bust that door down. Stand aside. Oh! Moe, Moe, say a few syllables. Are you all right? Say something. [HOOTING] Okay, I'm all right. What we need is a harder head. I think you got something there. Let's go. Right. Hey, heave. Heave. [BANG] SHEMP: Ho. Wait, I think it's cracking. What, the door? No, my head. Listen, fellas. I wanna get out of here. Let's try that door. [YELPS] Come on. Move. Don't sit there like you're dead. Go away, boys. You bother me. [ALL YELP] Whew. [HOOTING] [PANTING] Look, fellas. We gotta figure some way to get out of here. Whoo, whoo. Us, you lame-brain, who do you think I'm talking about? [ALL YELP] Oh, get out of here! Look out. Oh! What happened? You all right, kid? Oh! Oh, boy, that spook hit me right on top of the head. Me too. Look out. Lucky I took that away from him, or he'd have killed you both. Thanks, you're a pal. Yeah, swell guy. [CLOPPING] What's that? MOE: Oh, boy. Ain't she a beauty? SHEMP: It's Lady Godiva. Whoa, charger. Ain't she a doll? [YELPING] [HOWLING] [BARKS] Cut it out. Giddyup, charger. Come on. Let's watch 'em ride by. Yeah. Come on. Hey, wait a minute. Remember what happened to peeping Tom? Ah, that was a thousand years ago. Right. ALL: Yoo-hoo. [CROWD YELLING] [♪]
