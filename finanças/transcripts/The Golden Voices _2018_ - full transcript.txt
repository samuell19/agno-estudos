[PHONE BEEPING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [GRUNTING] Hello? Hey, Sidney. Hi, Nana. You still asleep? What time is it? It's 8 o'clock. P.M.?No, at 8 o'clock in the morning. Wait Nana, I've got to go, I'm gonna you back, okay? Got to get up... oh... No, wait, don't... [SIGHS] That girl hung up on me. [CHUCKLES] Sid, Sid, Sidney. Yeah. [SIGHS] Oh. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] VICKIE: Our attendance is at an all-time low. If you all don't do something to turn it around, you're going to come one day and the doors will be locked. But as usual, God has granted us a reprieve. I received a phone call this morning from the Golden Voices competition committee. This is our year to host the explosion. I believe this, this is the boost we need to get us back into prominence. And to get our attendance up. Isn't that wonderful? Sorry I'm late. My son James could teach you something about being on time. Could you be on time for at least one meeting? Young lady, I have worked at this college over 60 years. I've been on time more times than you can count. Catch up with me and then you can gripe.Hmm. Now, did I miss anything? Well, I was just telling the team that we're hosting the Golden Voices competition this year. And if we win... No, when we win, the $10,000 in prize money will shine a light on the school and grant us an opportunity to increase our attendance by 100%. Well, that is good news, but we don't have a choir, remember? That's why I need you to do your job. Get a winning choir together. Where am I supposed to get these voices? Oh, that's not my problem. What...I want results. Now, if you can't get it done, I will find someone who can. [STUTTERING] I'll meet with you all in your offices a little later. I'm tired of this. Okay, I... I'm sorry I'm late. You know what? Just get your stuff and leave. But I got leads, and if I could call them... [SIGHS] I'm sure I can make something happen. Hey, Ms. Jackson. Hey, I got good news and bad.Good news first, please. Our school is hosting the Golden Voice competition this year. What's the Golden Voice competition? That's a good question? And say, you mean, you want to be a member of the choir, and you never heard of the most prestigious competition we have? Well, that's all right. Look, the Golden Voices competition goes from college to college and they give out $10,000. $10,000? Yes $5,000 to the school that's hosting and $5,000 for the choir that wins. Uh, what's the bad news? We don't have a choir. [CHUCKLES] And we haven't competed in 10 years. And, I have to put together a choir that competes in two months. You don't have to hold up your hand. Sorry. [STUTTERS] No, you don't, we a team. I can help. What are the requirements?[LAUGHING] You the only choir member we have. I can do something. What are the requirements? I'm not even sure if I even remember the requirements. Let's see. I know the basic requirement is we have to have between eight and 31 members. Hm-hmm. And seeing as how we only have one member, [CHUCKLES] we don't even meet the basic requirement. [BOTH SIGH] Hey, let's go eat. [CHUCKLES] I'm buying. Whoa, whoa, no, no. Check, check, check, check my vocals. ♪ I can eat ♪ Cause I am hungry Okay, okay. [LAUGHING] Come on.[GROANS] Whew! I know, I was walking fast, huh? Tell me what's going on? It's taking us a lot longer to assess the damage. I'll have you a timeline on what's going on. Okay, all right, that will work. Let's go from there, all right? All right. Be calm. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yeah, Sidney, I got some bad news. Your apartment, the whole thing flooded. Are you serious? Yeah. And I can't let you back in there for a couple of days because it's too dangerous. Where am I supposed to stay? Now I got you a two-night stay at a motel. A motel? I didn't have to do that. How did my apartment flood? The Johnson boy played hooky today and he was in the bathtub and he left the water running for 45 minutes. And all that water overflowed and caused your ceiling to cave in. So, it's everything in your apartment that's damaged. Wow. All right, just [SIGHS] text me The address to the motel. It's coming your way right now. You have got to be kidding. EMMA: Gerald, do you want a snack before I go? No. Georgia should be walking through that door in three, two, one. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Hey, son. Hey, mama. Everything's done. I even prepared dinner. Do you want me to do anything before I go? Oh, no, honey. I thank you. Thank you, for all your help. Help? You the one blessing me. Are you going to church tonight? Emma, please tell your pastor I'm sorry I couldn't come out. My back is about to go out. [SIGHS] So I just can't make it. Well, I'll say a prayer for you and Gerald tonight, okay? And while you at it, say a prayer for my back. Oh, boy. You know that daughter of yours never did call me back. Sidney? Sidney.

Well I've been reading over the rules and we can recruit anyone to be in the choir. The only stipulation is that they have to enroll into the school for one fiscal year, with a minimum of 15 hours, that's it. Mm-hmm, well, now that's just a mole hill, not a mountain. Yeah.Okay, now... Oh! And if you want me to, I can block out all the time and go visit all the local churches and, uh... I can hold time for auditions. Mm-hmm. That's what I need you to do.

We always hold back about 12 at mid-term. I can't give you 12 scholarships. Well, I need at least five, so I can get some impact voices. Well, I can give you five, under one condition. What's that? If you don't pull this off, you will recommend my son, James, to take over the music department and you will retire immediately. I agree, if you promise me one thing. And that is? Give me a $10 raise. And if I do succeed, I'll have sole control over the music department. Hm, we understand each other. Agreed. James, head of the music department.

[EXHALES] Okay, I think I know what this is about, and I-- Do you know what the Golden Voices competition is? Singing competition. Kind of like joyful noise meets fighting tempations. No, ma'am. This is not an ordinary competition. This is a strictly voice competition. The most prestigious. And with your grandmother being over the music department at the university, the entire town is expecting her to win. Wow, that's a lot of pressure. That's why she needs your help. Four judges sit in a room, going over every sound that choir makes. That's why she wants it to be a capella. This is the CD from the last time they won. And we want to honor that. The dreams of this city, that university, and that wonderful woman in here, est in your hands. I was wrong. That, is a lot of pressure.[CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] All right, I guess I need to get going, get to work. I'm not finished. Now, why are you not speaking to your father? Emma, I don't want to talk about that. It's... [SIGHS] Anyway, I got the whole city, the town, the world in my hands, and Vickie is watching, so I got to go. I think we're going to be awesome. Do you all think we're going to be awesome? Anybody else think we're going to be okay, right? Yeah? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Excuse me?Are we singing the songs that you all gave us? For now, no. Sidney said she was going to try to ease in some new ones soon. Well, where are the musicians? Uh, they're supposed to be here by now. I'm sure they'll be here soon. Hey, everybody. ALL: Hey. How you doing? How you all doing?ALL: Good. Good. You all look good. [ALL CLAMORING]MAN 1: I try. MAN 2: We try.Oh, my goodness. Sidney?Huh? The band didn't show up this morning. Yes, I called them and told them not to come. So we don't need a band? If you'll take your seat, I'll explain. Okay, so the Golden Voices is a competition that changes from year to year. And this year, it's a capella Hence, no band. [ALL SIGHING] Yeah. So, just... Just give me a second. I just want you to hear something, all right? [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Okay, okay, all right, all right. So... So, what do you think? I really liked it. I liked the tune and everything. It was really good.

Yo...You can get used to it. All right, well, now that we got rid of the dead weight, we can go on and start afresh. Sidney, I know you think he's dead weight and all, but that's one of our lead singers. The best singer in town. Okay. Um... You know what? I have an idea. But it's going to take me some time.

I've been down so long now, I just... I lash out at anybody that try to challenge me. That goes for my manager, who won't answer my phone calls anymore. From my... My family had abandoned me a long time ago. Maybe I was out of line. Actually, the words hit home. I'll be honest with you. I tossed and turned all night last night. And not because of what you said. It was that song. That song beat me up. Really? [SIGHS] Look, I want to help you if I can. I don't know if I got it anymore. I haven't sung in years. It's just like riding a bike. Yeah, well, you can fall off a bike and crack your head. Hey, I want to help you as long as you let me. You got all your stuff? You ready to go? Yeah, right here. I'm good. Let's roll. You have got to admit it's pretty sad that your whole life is in a plastic bag. But it's all good because God's got you. This is a fresh start. And you, sir, need a fresh bath. Let's go. [EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY] This is what choir directors drive? Shut up.All right now. You got a Blu-ray player in this thing? What's going on? No Blu-ray. [EXHALES] Whoo. Let's roll down the window. Let's go. JAX: Ooh, all right. What is that smell?[SIGHS WEARILY] [SCREAMS] Help, help, Sidney! Oh! Call 911. SIDNEY: Nana. Nana.[SCREAMS] Sidney. Nana, Nana, stop! Nana! Stop. It's Jax Rebel. Jax what? I'll explain after breakfast... I'll just...Oh, God. [GROANS] It looks like your back is okay. Well, I imagine it is. Oh, Lord. Well, I'm glad to meet you, Jax Rebel. I'm going to try to fix us some breakfast and then you can explain it out later. Baby, what is your name? It's, uh... It's Isaac Griffin, ma'am. Isaac, your government name. Okay. Listen, there's a bar of soap in that bathroom with your name on it. And you use it. And after you get through using it, you take it and all them clothes in the trash. Oh, Lord. Baby, look through your daddy's clothes and see if you can find something for him to wear. I'll see what I can find. And then I'm going to try to fix us something to eat. Okay, come on now. JAX: I'm sorry.SIDNEY: Come on. Come on. SIDNEY: There you go. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you mad? No. But I do want to know, did you fall on your head last night? Perfect stranger into this house? He's an old R&B singer that fell on hard times and we needed a lead singer for the choir. I thought I'd spread the love of Jesus Christ. Oh, [LAUGHS] so now you a missionary worker? I always focus on the Kingdom's work. Well, the Kingdom needs to work on you. Well, what about your father. What... Now you and the Kingdom working, you haven't spent like two minutes with him. I didn't shove those drugs in his arms. Oh, so you clean up the kettle, but leave the pot out there. JAX: So, uh... Well, you clean up pretty good there. JAX: Thank you.[CHUCKLES] The cat got my granddaughter's tongue. I mean, you look all right. Well, um, this looks good. Oh, we got to pray. Wait, stop, pray.Okay. So, this is where the action happens. This... This is a nice space. Right? But this isn't the best of it. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on, slow poke. This is it. State-of-the-art recording studio. We just got it donated a couple years back. I think we're the only HBCU with equipment like this. This is, uh... This is unbelievable. I thought you could use it like it's your resetting place. You, uh... You trying to save me? I just thought that you could help us with the competition, and my grandmother's job is on the line. Sidney, I haven't sung in a long time. Hey, it is a God-given talent. Only he can take it away. I hope it's that easy, because you're putting a lot of faith in me. Nuh-uh, I ain't got faith in you. My faith is in God. I mean do you think it was an accident that we met like we did? "Met," is that what you call it? "Met"? I seem to have a different recollection.Really? With a car coming toward me. Will you just try? I will try. I can't promise anything, but I will try. Okay, that is all I ask, all right?All right. Let's go get you enrolled in college. [EXHALES] My mom would be over the moon knowing I'm about to be a college boy. Well, maybe you should call her. Maybe I will. Hey, I know it may not be any of my business, but I was just curious. Why don't you have anything to do with your father? You're right. It is none of your business. Come on. Let's get enrolled. Come here. Come here. You have got to talk to your father. You've got to talk to him or you will be lost. Now, I'm not going to tell you this anymore. You have got to talk to your father. Yes ma'am. Got room for an old R&B singer? [SIGHS] I heard you and your grandmother in there. It had to be... Had to be tough. Look... Can I say something without you biting my head off? You've helped me so much. I want to be able to help you. I know what it's like not to forgive someone. Not you, too. Look, I'm not here to preach to you, Sidney, all right? You know... Lord knows I'm the last person to call out anybody else's faults, but, I miss my pops all the time. And even though, [EXHALES] he was a real hound, he would beat on me. And he was always on the road, it's not a day that goes by I don't wish I would've spent more time with him. [SIGHING] But... It's just... My dad was not there for me. I was 15 when my mom died and he was drinking himself under the table, shooting up drugs. I mean, I was 15. Then he kept... Had the stroke, ended up paralyzed, and I'm... I'm just cleaning him up. It's just... It was a lot. [SIGHS] I don't know how to forgive him. Pray about it. [SCOFFS] You ask God how to do it. Yeah. I don't... I don't know. I'm going to tell you something that I have learned the hard way, all right? In life, you only have power, if you have peace. And Sidney, you deserve peace. Oh, we got an early day tomorrow. I'm going to head in. All right. Thanks for the talk. Hey, good night. Night. I tried to forget. But I kept remembering all the nights that I would ask you to stop drinking. [TEARFULLY] I pleaded with you to stop. Especially after Mama died, I needed you! And here I am, a 15-year-old girl, taking care of her dad... [SOBBING] There were nights that I wished that you would just die. And then you had a stroke that left you paralyzed. So humiliating, having to wipe your butt. Especially for a 15-year-old girl. It was not fair! Everybody wants me to forgive you. I don't know if I can. But God is working on me. I'm going to really try hard to be your daughter again, okay? But it's not going to happen overnight. [CELL PHONE RINGING] ROBERT: Sidney?Hello, Mr. Banks, yeah. I've got some good news for you. My apartment is ready? Okay, um... Yep, you can move back in. You all right?[CRYING] Thank you. Thank you. I really do love you, Daddy. [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] [R&B MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [PHONE RINGING] WOMAN: Mrs. Wilson, you have a call on line one. I am not taking any calls right now. It's the Golden Voices President. [SIGHS] Okay. Patch him through. MAN: Mrs. Wilson. Charles, how can I help you? I understand Isaac Griffin just enrolled in your school. Yes he... He... He came on this week. Why do you ask? Do you know that he's Jax Rebel? Think Chris Brown. Oh, got it. Thanks for the heads up.

[ALL CHEERING] I told you we were gonna do it. I told you! Hey, you all, we're going to win this competition hands down. Hands down. [CHEERING] I've been instructed to escort you off campus. Wait? What? What? Hey, where you all taking her? Wait, hey, get your hands off of her. CAMILLE: Where you all taking her? [INDISTINCT CHATTER]1 MAN: What we going to do? We had it. Don't even worry about it. I'm about to... I'm about to call Ms. Jackson. Ooh, it sure is a pretty day. It sure is pretty. [LAUGHS] You know, I'm just going... Is your back feeling better? That's what I was just going to tell you. My back is feeling better and better every day. You not going back to that college, is you? Oh, child, no. I'm going to go on sitting here, and read my Bible and drink this Kool-Aid all day. And I'm going to sit right here, with you. GEORGIA: Damn, what they doing home so early? What you all doing home so early? We got fired. Fired?Yeah. JAX: Not only that, she had security escort us out. What? Apparently Vickie found out about Jax's past, and she said I lied on my application. What? Lied? Lord have mercy. You know what's even worse?What? This was probably the best rehearsal we've had. Best one yet, hands down. Oh gosh... Even I got to admit like, I never felt that good in a long time. Lord, what's wrong with that girl? Did she lose her mind? That Vickie ain't going to stop until she run that college in the ground. I'm just... I'm going to lay down. I'm going to go take a walk. Bad!Ain't you going to say something? Oh, hey, you better trust and believe I am. Oh yeah, I just need to be all prayed up before I go to that college. I don't want to be Vickie and I'm going to pray for her. Mm-hmm. [R&B MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Well, thanks for the change of venue for a while. Yeah, it's the least I could do. I was really digging being in college though. [CHUCKLES] I'm sorry to get your hopes up. It's all right. Figured it was too good to be true anyway. You know, you really don't seem like the person the tabloids wrote about. Look, I, uh... I made one mistake, in the heat of the moment. Next thing I know I was spiraling out of control. My management team, they were pushing this whole bad boy image, and I felt like I had to represent. What people don't tell you is that fall from grace, it's a hard fall. And it... It breaks every bone in your body. It takes a while to recover. But you, you taught me how to walk again, Sidney. [CHUCKLES] And I'll be forever grateful. No, I don't know if I did anything. But you did. You trusted me. And you didn't even know if I could sing anymore. Oh. God has you right where he needs you to be. If it's right here, I hope so. Will I see you again? As much as you can stand. [BOTH LAUGHING] All right, well, lady. Hey, there's something I want you to know. What's that? I've never done drugs ever. Thank you, for sharing that with me. Okay. Hey. Yeah. You want to have dinner at my place tomorrow night? Yeah, I'd like that. All right. I'll see you then. Jax Rebel. [ENGINE STARTS] Wait, wait. What's going on? How dare you fire my granddaughter? Of all the underhanded, conniving, low down, dirty, miserable trick. Now I knew you wanted my job, but I expected you to come after me. Who do you think you are, bursting into my office, threatening me? This is way beyond a threat, baby, I'm coming after your job. I've already called Raymond. That's right, I called Raymond. And you ought to be getting a call right about... Right about now. [PHONE RINGING] Yes? But... Fired? You can't fire me. My contract has another year. [STUTTERS] Hello? He fired me. Oh, you thought this cat didn't have any claws left, didn't you? He fired me. Just get up out of my seat. What? I don't believe I stuttered. Get your doughnut-eating behind out of my seat! You have got to be kidding me. You haven't shown any love or compassion since you took over this school.Well, that's not true. Now, the Lord put us in charge of these children to encourage them to be the help, not like us. I know that. You somehow have forgotten that this is a Christian College, not a corporation. Get up out of my seat. I will not. Let me leave you with a little dignity before I call security. I will be back for the rest of my things. Take all your donuts and your papers and all your other little junk and get on out. You haven't heard the last from me. Let's go, Junior.Let's go? I said let's go, Junior. You promised me a job. Boy, if you don't get in this car... Acting silly. Act like you don't have common sense. If I say "Let's go" I mean let's go. I know what I'm doing. When I say "Let's go," I mean let's go. I thought we had an agreement that you were never to refer to me... If you don't stop... Ta-da. Yeah, so, I'll tell you what. I ain't never had no home cooked meal out of Styrofoam, that you clearly didn't make, but it's all right. [LAUGHS] Well, I'm glad I can impress you. Yeah. Oh, can we bless the food first? Oh, yeah. Yeah, close your eyes. Heavenly Father, thank you for this day and this food and the company. I pray that you bless this food for the nourishment of our minds, our bodies, and our souls. In Jesus' name, Amen. Amen. All right, well I hope it's good. [CHUCKLING] Nah. I'm sure it will be good. I'm sure it will be good even though I know you country girls can cook. That's all right, I'll let you slide. I mean, I've been in Dallas for a while. I'll get Nana to teach me again. I'll tell you what. I'll take my chances. Good. That's all right. That's good. Yeah. So, uh, I've been writing again. Oh, my God, that's great. But check this though. I've been writing gospel songs. Boy, get the ham sandwich out of there. I'm telling you all. You know it's... Seriously, Sidney, though, I felt so alive singing with that choir at the college. That day we left, I found this little old church, and gave my life to Christ. I'm going to give my little 15 minutes of praise on right here. Hallelujah. Jesus!That's what I'm talking about. Right? Right? Right? But look, you know what? The thing that I hate is that we didn't get to help the college win.I know. I know. I think Nana tricked me into taking that job. [LAUGHS] But those kids... Gosh, yeah, they had an effect on me, too. So much so that I went to Bible study on Wednesday, and I've been dabbling back in the Church myself a little bit. So there are legions of angels in Heaven right now dancing behind that statement right there. A whole legion. You know what?[CELL PHONE RINGING] I'm going to take this call. It's Nana. All right, go ahead. Hey. So what's up? No, no, slow down. Slow... Wait, what? Okay, so Nana wants us to go back to the school. What? How? I don't know. But she needs your answer right now. Yeah, I mean, of course. He said okay. Okay. All right. Okay, we'll be there tomorrow. Okay bye. Bye. Bye, Nana. I'll talk to you later. So yeah, apparently, Vickie got fired. Now Nana is the Dean. We're both going to get reinstated, and we need to be back at the school tomorrow for the Explosion because there are two days... You don't have to tell me twice. Okay, calm down. We don't have to leave right now. All right, brother got a little excited for this store bought chicken over here. I'm just saying. We go from college to college looking for the best choir. We judge on a five-point system. Good luck. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, this is a closed competition. [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] You already jeopardized the competition by coming in like that. WOMAN: No, we not. Oh, no. We've come too far. That's right. They better be good. SIDNEY: One, two...

Hey, y'all! We won. We won the 2018 Golden Voices Award. GEORGIA: My granddaughter, Sidney, decided to stay on and now she's the head of the music department. Jax Rebel is still here. He's teaching music, he's maintaining a 4.0 average and he's getting ready to put out a gospel album. Now, that is really something. And guess what, y'all? We did it all without the help of Vickie or her son, James. [LAUGHING] How about that? [CLOSING CREDITS SONG PLAYING]
