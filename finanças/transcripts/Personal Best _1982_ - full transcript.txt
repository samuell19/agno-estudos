(HEART BEATING) I want to know exactly how it's bothering you. (GRUNTS ) (PEOPLE CLAPPING) (MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) -15 meters, 60. -All right. All right. All right. That cunt's gonna put me in an early grave, I swear to God. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) (MAN WHISTLING) (PEOPLE CHEERING) MAN: What's your name? 127, what's your name? All right, Tory. TINGLOFF: Tory? Tory? How's the knee? Fuck the knee. TORY: Look at us. MAN ON PA: And the winner... Fern Wadkins! In third place, with 2,581 points, Charlene Benveniste. In second place, with 4,639 points, Tory Skinner. This guy got so drunk at this party that his friends called a cab for him so he wouldn?t have to drive home. So he's sitting in the back of the cab and... (MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX) ''Hey?'' The cab driver pulls the window back and says, ''What do you want?'' And he goes, ''You got room up there for two six packs and a pizza?'' The cab driver says, ''Sure.'' And the guy goes... (RETCHING) (GIRLS LAUGHING) -Hey, Tory. -Hello, Duane. DUANE: You did a good job today. Congratulations. -Thank you. -Come on, Duane. -WAITRESS: Are you finished? -Yes. -Hey, Rick. What's happening? -Roscoe, congratulations. -And you, you were really something. -Thank you. RICK: Oh. This is my daughter, Chris. -Hi. -Hi. Will you excuse me? RICK: We're going right to the dorm. I'll walk. I don't have to get up tomorrow. All righty. -Anyway, that was some performance. -Thank you. (EXHALES ) Oh, come on, Roscoe, did you see that bimbo he was with? I worked out for four years. So what? Winning. Oh, boy. Well, like they say, ''It ain't everything.'' It ain't everything. I'll tell you, winning is like sex. Sometimes you think there's just got to be more. Listen, buddy. -Speak for yourself. -Oh, yeah? (CRASHING) What was that? GIRL: Are you okay? CHRIS: Yes. -Are you all right? -Are you a friend of hers? -Yes, I know her. -Yeah, I'm sorry. -GIRL: I want to help. Can I do anything? -No. -Let's go and sit down, okay? -I'm okay. -You'll feel better. -I'm all right. Look, let's go sit up here and sit down, please. Here. Put your head between your legs, please, and stay there. I just didn't eat today. Listen, I want to pay for this. ROSCOE: Damn it, girl. Just keep it there for a minute. CHRIS: It's okay. I'll be fine. TORY: Which dorm are you in? -Bean East. But, really, I'm fine. -TORY: Come on. ROSCOE: So, you'll get her home? TORY: I've got my car. We're just down the street here. So, you take care of yourself, you hear? Thank you so much. Hey, it's nothing. -Great day, Tory. See you. -Thanks, Roscoe. ROSCOE: You take care. Are you okay? Are you okay? (CAR ENGINE CRANKING) TORY: The starter on this is totally screwed. (TORY SIGHING) -Listen, congratulations. -What for? Well, I watched your long jump today. It was... It was great. Tremendous height. Thanks. Thank you. (CAR ENGINE CRANKING) I don't know, some days you really get into it, and, I don't know, I guess you get lucky. Oh, God, here. You want some Kleenex to wipe up that sour cream and chive? Here. I'll help you. I'll put some on my pants if you want. You won't feel so alone. (SOBBING) Oh, hell. It hurts. (CRYING) I'm sorry. (CHRIS LAUGHING) TORY: Sorry about that, I'm not a very good hummer. (TORY LAUGHING) (COUGHING) (TORY HUMMING) -TORY: Don't smoke much? -No. It's like a sail. Painting and Miss Clairol. This I do for me. The way it catches the light and the color... Miss Clairol. This I do for me! CHRIS: What's your boyfriend? TORY: Duane? CHRIS: Mmm-hmm. TORY: Not good enough. (BOTH LAUGH) CHRIS: Not good enough? TORY: Yeah. TORY: If the son of a bitch could have cleared 17'6'', we'd still be together. (CHRIS CHUCKLES ) TORY: So, how Indian are you, anyway? CHRIS: Pretty Indian. TORY: (MIMICKING CHRIS ) Pretty Indian? TORY: Well, how Indian is pretty Indian? CHRIS: Oh, good, there you are. Look at that. TORY: Are you registered with the BIA? Bureau of Indian Affairs? CHRIS: I know what it is. Yeah. TORY: No shit? What did you spill? Drooling all over the place? (TORY BELCHING) Excuse me. Oh, that's nothing. What? I'm not pointing, you goof. -Give it a tug. -Tug? Give it a tug. (CHRIS FARTS ) I wish you could have seen your face. My teammate, Debbie Peyton, she used to come up to me before every race and give it a yank for luck. -For luck? -For luck. Get out. Anyway, I watched you today, too. -You did? -Yeah. (LAUGHING) That must have been a depressing sight. No. No. No. Your lead leg is a little straight. But basically, you've got good technique. Better than anybody in that race today, even Laura. (SCOFFS ) Yeah. Well, I couldn?t get my step. Bullshit. You had your step and lost it. What are you taking about? At the fifth hurdle, when you saw Laura. -I didn't see Laura. -You saw her. You definitely saw her. And what's that supposed to mean? It means Laura's very fast the last 40 meters. -So? -You know it. Everybody knows it. You saw her and you choked. -What is this? -Who knows? I'll bet your father is always saying you don't have any killer instinct. Am I right? I thought so. I'm right. Well, listen, I'll tell you one thing. I'm as competitive as you are. (SCOFFS ) Oh, yeah? Yeah. At what? (TORY GIGGLES ) -Go ahead. Name it. -Arm wrestling. Arm wrestling? Yeah. I've got two brothers, and I can beat them both. -I'd like to see those two brothers. -No, you wouldn?t. -But that's not what we're taking about. -Oh, well, what are we taking about? -Arm wrestling. -Oh, yeah. Listen, are we gonna do this or not? Because if we do, I'm going to whip your ass. -Okay. Whip my ass. -I plan to. -So, how do we do this? -On the floor. I know that. Which arm? You have two choices. Okay. Whoa ! Serious here. Anytime you're ready. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Shit. (BREATHING HEAVILY) God. (GRUNTS ) (GRUNTS ) (TORY GRUNTS ) I got Montreal in two weeks, and I don't wanna break my fucking arms. Let's quit on the count of three, okay? Okay? One, two, three. CHRIS: Oh. You cheater. (CHRIS SIGHING) Sore loser, huh? Oh, God. I take it back. You're tough. Tough. So, what did he say to you after the race? My dad? He stared at his stopwatch and told me I forgot my warm-up shoes. Sometimes, when you know someone, it keeps you from knowing something about them that a total stranger would see right away. If I could have been anyone in that race today, I'd have been you. Why? Because you can be great. I've just been thinking my whole life is over. I mean, everything I've worked for up to now. Bullshit. You could go to Moscow in '80. You've got everything. Speed, strength, flexibility. Everything I always wanted, you've got. If I had what you have, I'd... Oh, fuck. What's wrong? (WHISPERING) I'm very fucking scared right now. Very scared. Why? -What are you thinking? -I don't know. What if I try it again? (CHUCKLES ) I don't know. TORY: Not bad. I used to get paid for this. For what? Tickling. My dad and my brothers used to pay me a nickel an arm, a dime a leg and a quarter a back. And you're not retired? I bet my brothers would have called you the same thing they called me. -And what's that? -A carpenter's dream. A carpenter's dream? Flat as a board and easy to nail. -How did you do that? -Oh, it was easy. Gee, I've never been hurt. -All right. It's my turn. -Okay. Oh, this feels pretty good. (TORY CHUCKLING) I don't think I've ever had this done before. (TIRES SQUEALING) CHRIS: Get those guys. CHRIS: Ten points if you can get 'em. TORY: (LAUGHING) All right. (MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO) (TIRES SCREECHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Grab that for me? So when we looked down the aisle, we went all green. CHRIS: Oh, Christ, I gotta call my father. TORY: What for? CHRIS: I told him I'd call him when we got to San Luis. TORY: Oh, what's he gonna do? Give you your workout over the phone? TORY: Will you listen to me? CHRIS: Uh-huh. TORY: What are you worried about? Tingloff or your father? CHRIS: Well, you know. I mean, Tingloff's Tingloff. I mean, why would he wanna coach me? TORY: Because I say so. CHRIS: Oh, come on. TORY: No, you come on. TORY: You're good. Tingloff's a good coach. He'll see that. It's no big deal. CHRIS: I'm not so sure. TORY: Oh, you're not so sure about anything, you big chicken. Hey, listen to me. Did you ever meet my sidekick? (BOTH LAUGHING) CHRIS: Hey! MAN ON TV: On the final turn, Anita Weiss of East Germany, Gluth of East Germany, Shtereva of... RICK: Just because he's good for your friend, Tory Skinner, doesn't mean he's good for you. You think he's a better coach than your father? Rita, shut up. If he was or wasn't, you wouldn?t know the difference. Now what's he going to offer you? Full tuition? Half? What? Nothing. (CUTLERY CLATTERING) Rita. Nothing? Nothing? I guess Tingloff isn't that good for Tory Skinner. She didn't make the first 10. Yeah. I guess she's only the 11th best pentathlete in the world. (GRUNTING) TINGLOFF: Hey, Mac. Hey, Mac. These girls have to warm up, you know what I mean? (ZENK GRUNTING) Zenk's got a few more throws. I'm waiting for him. Yeah. Well, why don't you wait down there and give Zenk some encouragement? (SIGHING) Okay, Tory. Now you were gonna tell me all about Little Orphan Annie over there. -Yeah, she's... She's... -She's what? Down on her luck? Since when is another athlete?s performance so important to you, huh? Since when? She's better than you think. Come on, Tory. I was at the trials. I saw her. She ran the hurdles, right? -Yeah. -Yeah. No speed, no guts. So, how come a third-rate hurdler matters so much? She's better than that. Okay. She's second-rate. Now what? You're wrong. What makes you such an expert about this girl? You. You really think you got my number. Don't you? Yeah. Okay. Okay, she can work out with the team, but I am not going to coach her. I swear sometimes I could just kill you. I'm still not going to coach her. Get out of here. Everybody's gonna think I'm a total pussy as it is. Well, you are. I probably am. -What happened? -TORY: Come on, kid. You're in. Really? All right. (IT'S OVER PLAYING ON TAPE) No, no, no. You're a speed jumper, God damn it. You accelerate through the jump. It's your last three steps, okay? CHRIS: Sorry. TINGLOFF: Does she go everywhere with her? Yeah. Tory meets Chris... TINGLOFF: Yeah. And tell her to take the olive out of her ass. ROSCOE: Come on, one more. -Come on. -TINGLOFF: Tory. Forget it. It's not going to do you or her any good. -TINGLOFF: Young love. Boy, oh, boy. -Man. TINGLOFF: Not a bad jump. Why didn't you finish it? TORY: What about it? Show me, show me. You're the coach. Like that? Oh. Okay. TORY: I see. Okay. I guess I should have landed like that. Maybe... All right. You're in for it. TINGLOFF: Oh, no. Time out. Please. I quit. You're gonna hurt me. Don't hurt me. Don't... (TINGLOFF LAUGHING) TINGLOFF: You've got it. You're the boss. TORY: Okay. TINGLOFF: Tanya, put up seven. TANYA: Okay. Let's get this show on the road. We lose the track in 10 minutes. Hey, Chris? CHRIS: Yes, Mr. Tingloff? -TINGLOFF: Could you get the blocks? -The blocks? TINGLOFF: Yeah, it's getting late. That really sucks. What? That's probably the first thing you've said to her in two months. Trying to make her feel like a piece of shit? Of course not. Then give her a lane and let her run the trial. (SCOFFING) What for? I told... Because I'm asking you to. Because you've behaved very badly. Chris? Why don't you take that open lane? CHRIS: Me? Yes. You. CHRIS: Which open lane? Any open lane, God damn it. All right, people... -What do I do... -ROSCOE: Just put it down, baby. ROSCOE: You can't run with it. TINGLOFF: I'll take Tory. Penny, you get Pam. Maureen, take Trish. And Tanya, get Pooch. TORY: We don't have a watch on Chris. What about Chris? Don't worry about it. Come on. Get your sweatshirt off. Let's go. TINGLOFF: Ready? (SHOUTING) Chris didn't put her blocks down. Come on, babe, get your blocks. TINGLOFF: How about it? Take your time, babe. We'll wait. TINGLOFF: Come on. Come on. We're out of here in 10 minutes. I'm ready. I'm ready. All right, stand up. Runners, to your mark. Get set... (GUN FIRES ) My God, she fainted. Jesus, look at her go. GIRL: Shit, she's fast. Shit, fuck, piss! Goddamn son of a bitch. You all right? Oh, yeah, I'm such a dingbat. I forgot to tighten the rear block. Oh. Oh, Mr. Tingloff. Look, I'm sorry. I know I can do better if you could just give me another chance. You ought to fall on your face more often. See? I told you, you'd do great. -Hey, Terry, what was my time? -You okay? It was beautiful. You all right? Are you all right? That was beautiful. -Well done, kiddo. -Clocked you to 10.3. You were terrific. Okay. ROSCOE: Call it. WOMAN: Heads. (WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES PLAYING) (GIRLS CHEERING) MAUREEN: So, how was Norman? TANYA: Actually, he's got a curved weenie. MAUREEN: To the left or to the right? -To the left. -That can be a problem. GIRL 1 : 7.7, 7.8. TANYA: For a sprinter, maybe. GIRL 2: No. 8.3, 8.5. GIRL 1 : Really? GIRL 2: I'm sure he'll do it. GIRL 2: Well, it's possible. GIRL 1 : Guess so. Tingloff wants to see you when you're out of here. CHRIS: What for? I heard him tell Roscoe he wants to take her to the Maple Leaf Games. You're kidding? But I haven't done anything since Eugene. Toronto is invitational. That's what Roscoe said. What did Tingloff say? He said, ''Don't worry about it.'' ''Don't worry about it.'' What does that mean? It means you got a coach, honey. (GIRLS CHEERING) GIRL 1 : Are you kidding? Okay. Listen to this one. Do you guys know why Oriental men have slanty eyes and buck teeth? -GIRL: No. -No. (GIRLS GIGGLING) I don't get it. (LAUGHING) She doesn't get it. I don't. I'll explain it to you later. I'm getting out of here. GIRL 1: Have you ever encountered this before? GIRL 2: Never to the left. MAN 1 : But please remember that at all times you are an ambassador of your country. Sportsmanship and goodwill on the field, adult behavior off it. And the host country is giving us its best. Let's give them our bests. MAN 2: Okay. Cali, Colombia has a few more unexpected things to offer. Including Montezuma's revenge. So, girls, how about not using Visine. And no scented Tampax. Because it might show up in the test. And then... -TORY: No men. -...no men. Don't get caught with them in your room. Have a nice day, ladies. CHRIS: When do we get to work out? TORY: As soon as this cow finishes shopping. CHRIS: Oh, shit. Hold it, girls. Hold it. Hold it right there. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could I have one of those? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) -Jesus, I feel like King Kong. -Imagine how I feel. -Hey, should you be eating that? -Oh, it's okay. It's not water. Yeah. It's got a skin. It's fine. (FLUSHING) -(CRYING) I'm burning up. -Here you go. I know, I know. -Hang on, they're there. -Just get me up, please. (CHRIS CRIES PAINFULLY) -Okay. Come on. Try to straighten up. -It hurts. CHRIS: I can't straighten up. TORY: All right. (CHRIS CRYING) -This is a doctor? -TANYA: This is Raoul. TORY: Raoul who? TANYA: He's a medical student. We couldn?t find a doctor. Wait a minute. He doesn't understand English? Tory. Tory. We all want what's best for her. Let him try, okay? TORY: What's happening? TANYA: He's checking for appendicitis or something. (RAOUL SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Opium. -TORY: Opium? -He wants her to smoke a little bit. What do you think he's trying to do? TANYA: She's got food poisoning and cramps. -It's going to relax her. -It's fine. They do that in England all the time. It's true. The opium stops the cramps. TORY: Are you sure? SHEILA: I'm not sure. But we've got to try. (CHRIS GRUNTING) TORY: Okay. You guys better split. This isn't a party. Okay. Okay, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. (TORY SIGHING) What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm just going to go lie down for a minute. No, please don't. Please don't. Please don't. Please don't. Please don't let me go. -Please don't. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. (MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) (PEOPLE CHEERING) (TORY GRUNTS ) Fuck. Look, I don't care how you feel. You've got two more events, and you're going to finish. No athlete of mine, unless they've broken something, is going to DNF. What kind of a score am I going to have after that? -What does DNF mean to you? -It means not finishing. Bullshit. It means not caring. It means not caring about yourself or anything. It doesn't matter to me what you do, just as long as you don't quit. You don't want to finish, I don't want to look at you. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here. (TORY SOBS ) Look, it's my fault. You're sick and she can't perform. What is this shit? By the way, you've got a race to run. -Or are you going to bother? -Yes, I'm gonna bother. Then warm up. (GUN FIRES ) (PEOPLE CHEERING) (GIRLS CHUCKLE) (CHRIS EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) It was a good race. I got you at 13.32. You ought to get food poisoning more often. Thank you, and fuck you. What does that mean? It means the way you handled Tory was real chicken shit. She's responsible for my performance today. Not you. Not me. Tory. Well, be sure and congratulate her, huh? She ran a hell of a race. (IT'S OVER PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (ZENK SINGING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (GIRL LAUGHING) TINGLOFF: Tory? TORY: (WHISPERING) Oh, Christ. TINGLOFF: You guys, excuse us a minute, please. -So, are you comfortable smoking that? -Sure. Want a hit? Not really. I don't like the way you're looking. You better go to bed. Oh, come on, Terry, the meet's over. Lay off for once. Okay. Okay. Let me get Chris. GIRL: Terry, come here. TORY: Whoa ! -TORY: (WHISPERING) It's bedtime. -Bedtime? -Bedtime. -What do you mean? It's time to go to bed. Really? All right. Hey, Tory, check this out. A lady hurdler. TORY: Let go of me, bucko. ZENK: Hey, I'm sorry. Thank you. (WHIMPERS ) I'm sorry. I know. (MUSIC PLAYING ON TAPE) Who's the Indian? -Indian? -Yeah. Your mom or your dad? Mom. Shoshone? Keep going. Go ahead, keep going. Keep stretching. -Oh, shit. -Jesus. Easy. Easy. Oh, Christ. Jeez. Easy. Easy. Easy. Relax. Relax, babe. Just relax, I've got you. Relax. You still pissed? Anyway, how would you like a full ride next year? Room, board, tuition, everything. Are you kidding? You'll have to stay here this summer with me. Work out with me. You think you can do that? -Well, sure. -Good. And starting next year, I want you to do pentathlon. What's wrong? I don't think I can do that. Well, if you can't, you can't. You've got speed, strength to body weight that's unreal. I misjudged it all. You know, Chris, there's room for more than one in the country. -One what? -Pentathlete. If Tory goes to the Games, that leaves room for two more. I wasn't thinking about that. -Of course you weren't. -I wasn't. I'm agreeing with you. You really think you know it all, don't you? No. No. Like one thing I don't know, I don't know what scares you more. Getting beat by Tory Skinner or beating her? Moscow in '80. (CAR DOOR CLOSES ) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Bet I can make you drop that plate. Wanna bet? No. Come on, leave me alone. I told you, Tingloff had me late and the market was closed. Well, couldn?t you have managed? What? Told them that I had to get you some packing boxes? Yeah. Well, I had to sell our books and pick up the laundry and make sure the phone wasn't disconnected since we're staying. -What about Lucky's? -They didn't have any. -They didn't have any? -That's right. Lucky's didn't have any boxes of any kind? Not empty ones. (TORY SIGHING) Okay, it does bother you. I'll tell Tingloff tomorrow. I won't do pentathlon. It doesn't mean that much to me. I swear it. That doesn't bother me. Maybe it's Tingloff. Maybe it's being stuck here for six weeks. (WHISPERING) Maybe it's that you don't mean that. I do mean it. Because you know it's what I want. Bullshit. We'll stay and work out, okay? Okay? Come on. Come on. (BOTH PANTING) (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) (TORY SIGHING) (ALL SINGING) Okay. A knife, a knife. To cut the cake. Yeah. We better eat before we get sick. I love it. It's great. It's just like yours. I love it. It's so neat. Well, not exactly... (GIRLS LAUGHING) TORY: Oh, I made her a pentathlon workout book. TINGLOFF: The high jump, long jump, 800 meters. Five events. But the thing to remember is this. The pentathlon is one event. (TINGLOFF GRUNTS ) (TINGLOFF COUGHING) -Not me, honey, the wall. -I know. TINGLOFF: In the shot, you gotta feel that you can tear a piece out of yourself. Hey. (TINGLOFF CHUCKLES ) TINGLOFF: Gotta feel you're gonna explode. (GRUNTS ) TINGLOFF: The high jump is a masochist's event. It always ends on failure. Just when you're really getting whipped, you reach that event that calls for reckless abandon. You have to throw yourself through the air, as fast and as far as you can. (EXHALING) They didn't have swordfish, so I got halibut, okay? Halibut? Sit down. Look at this. Look. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) CHRIS: Look where I'm ranked. Tingloff says I'm the best high jumper here. I told you so, kiddo. I got some fish to fry. TINGLOFF: I don't want you doing that. Okay, let's go. If you're gonna change your workout, Tory, let me in on it. TORY: Okay, one more. Come on, real quick. Up. Oh, good. Good. -What's that? -TORY: It's low reps, that's what I do. I want her to taper. -Fuck it. Let's go take a steam. -CHRIS: Okay. Chris, just wait a minute for me, will you? I mean, if it's all right with Tory. All right, the Pan Am Games are in 10 days. It's the last international competition before the Olympics. And furthermore, only two athletes qualify for the Pan Am Games and Tory knows it. What's that supposed to mean? Tory is just trying to help. I know. I know. But do me a favor. Don't get any more help from her until after the Pan Ams, okay? ROSCOE: Look, these guys will tell you. These guys will tell you different things about the 800. Someone will say, ''As long as you run between 2.15, 2.20, that's okay, that's... '' Or 2.12 or 2.10. It's the last fucking event. -You gotta beat somebody by... -GIRL: Hey, how's it going, you guys? TINGLOFF: Well, the 800 is the last event. If you're even up in points, you'll have to beat somebody... MAN: There's no hell on earth like it if you gotta beat anybody. You're going to have to be ready to kill yourself. TINGLOFF: You're going to have to run. MAN: It's the last event, and you're going to have to run. TINGLOFF: You're gonna have to run. TINGLOFF: Oh, yeah. (LAUGHING) You're never gonna make it. (SHOUTING) You're never gonna make it, pal. You're gonna die. Another 70 meters, you're going to die. (TINGLOFF LAUGHING) Your legs are gonna go. Yeah, they're going, they're going. You're going to be Jell-O, man, Jell-O. Hey, here she comes, man. She's right on your ass. She's right on your ass. Keep going. Come on, keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Push it. Push it. Uh-uh. Too bad. You just let a pussy beat you, you dumb asshole. (TINGLOFF LAUGHING) CHRIS: Tingloff wants me to do squats. TORY: So? CHRIS: So, the squat rack is better at the men's gym. TORY: If I'm at the women's gym, then who's gonna spot you? CHRIS: Tingloff. TORY: Tingloff? Wait a second. TORY: Tingloff? CHRIS: Yeah, Tingloff. -Oh, isn't that nice? -Hi, guys. Sure. I just... Just don't understand why you get so angry. I think you do. -Oh, God, can we just go work out? -Do whatever you want. That's just it, I can't. I can't stop worrying about you. What about me? What you're thinking, what you think I think. What you want. Everything. I don't know. So? You worry about what everybody thinks. Why should you be different with me? -Hi. -GIRL: Come on, you guys. I guess I'm not. Okay, there's only one thing left to do, kiddo. See other people. See other people? What are you taking about? Look, either we're together or we're not together. Jesus Christ, Tory. We're friends. Yeah, we may be friends, but every once in a while we also fuck each other. Either you move out or I move out and we really are just friends. No. No? Oh, hell. Don't worry, we won't work out together. No. That's not it. I want to work out with you. You make me feel like I can do something, like I'm gonna do something. More than Tingloff. I just... What? Need you. Fuck this. No. Okay. Okay. I guess I can't argue with that. Let's... Let's not do this to each other anymore, okay? Come on. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, let's get out of here. Wait a second. (WHISPERING) Are you awake? Are you awake? CHRIS: What? -What? -Nothing. Come on, what? -What's bugging you? -I shouldn?t get into it. -Tingloff will just have another shit fit. -Don't give me that. It'll drive me nuts for the rest of the day. Unless you're trying to drive me nuts. Yeah, I'm trying to drive you nuts. Come on. What? Okay. Try an approach where you really lower yourself, bigger steps. Like you? Not like me. You're the power jumper. You can take bigger steps. Lower yourself. Catch your center of gravity on the rise. See, I start here and you should start there. Try it sometime when we're not on such a shitty track. Come on. Do you have to check and see if he's watching every time we talk? All right. All right. -Don't do me any favors. -I'll try it. Hey, forget it. (CHRIS SCREAMING) (CRYING) Pooch, grab that bag, grab her shoulder and hold it. Easy, honey, I've done this before. CHRIS: Get away. Get... (BONES CRACKS ) (CHRIS CRYING) -What happened? -It's her knee. I popped it back. I'll get some ice and an Ace bandage. Don't you people have a workout to finish? What about it, huh? TINGLOFF: Okay, how did it happen? I was just doing that three-step approach and... (CHRIS SIGHING) And I went to take off and my knee... I don't know, it just... It just went. And that's it? Well, yeah. Is that your mark? You know, jumping is a fairly difficult, complicated mental process. By comparison, counting to three is not so difficult. One, two... Now how in the fuck could you have made a mistake like that? She didn't. I did. I moved the mark. You what? I was showing her how to lengthen her approach. Oh. -Any particular reason? -Well, yeah. To lower her... -To lower what? -Her center of gravity. To lower her center of gravity? She's got a long stride. But that's too far. I didn't mean for her to try it here on this shitty surface. Oh, then why did you move her mark here? It was only a couple of inches. It was... -I thought... -You thought what? I mean, I... -It couldn?t be that far. I... -I hope you understand all this. You know I would do anything to avoid hurting you. Could you at least look at me? Damn it, don't play the dumb Indian with me now. Don't let him do this to us. Do what? -What's he doing? -What did I do? Spit it out for once in your life. Did I do this to you on purpose? Did I? Did I? Did I? You're so fucking gutless. Do you have a fucking thought in your fucking head? My thought is that we're both better off with a dumb Indian. -Please, don't... -No. (GIRLS CHATTERING) PENNY: Whose fault? Well, was it anybody's fault? How is she? -I guess so. -What did he say? Is she okay? What'd Tingloff say? You saw him, didn't you? Is she okay? -Is she all right? -Shut up, Penny. I just want to sit here and sweat a minute, all right? Okay. PENNY: Hey, Pooch? Pooch, ever smell mothballs? POOCH: Sure. (CHUCKLING) How did you get their little legs apart? Shut up, Penny. Jeez. (GIRL LAUGHING) TINGLOFF: Ross just talked to Tory. She's waiting to hear if she should clear out of your place. Come on, let's go. Let's go. What do you want to do, Chris? (SNIFFLING) Okay, you stay at my place tonight. Is it still hurting? Then what is it? What is it? (SOBBING) You're mad at me. You dumb cunt. How can you be more frightened of me than being hurt? Come on, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Jesus. Okay. All right. (CHRIS CRYING) (SHUSHING) It's okay. Okay. All right. TINGLOFF: Want a Pepsi? Dr Pepper? How about a beer? Do you want a joint? Haagen-Dazs ice cream? CHRIS: You keep that in your house? What flavor? Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, rum raisin. No strawberry? Strawberry, too. (PHONE RINGING) I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah? No. No. She's a lot better. No, forget the blocks. Light workout. For sure. Okay. Roscoe sends his best. (PHONE RINGING) Let it ring. Let it ring. You don't have to answer my phone. Here. I'd just as soon not hear from anybody else tonight. You know, it's been a long day. Yeah, just let it ring. Oh, shit. All you're worried about is your fucking girlfriend. What the fuck is that? Your fucking girlfriend. She's crippled you. Oh, God. (BLOWING NOSE) Excuse me. All right, one thing you gotta understand. I could have been a man's coach. Backfield coach, Oregon State. I had the job. I had the job. I actually had the job. Do you know what I'm saying? I had the job. Oh, well. Coach of the Year. I was Coach of the Year, last year. You know what that means when you're a woman's coach? Jack shit. I mean, I could've coached football. Do you actually think that Chuck Noll has to worry that Franco Harris is going to cry because Terry Bradshaw won't talk to him, hmm? Jack Lambert can't play because Mel Blount hurt his feelings? That Lynn Swann is pregnant? That Rocky Bleier forgot his Tampax? Oh, fuck. I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to upset you. Listen, she didn't mean it. She didn't mean it. You know what you're like? There's a joke about a faggot who makes a pass at a Marine in the men's room on the 40th floor of the Empire State Building. The Marine throws the faggot out the window. The Marine gets down to the street, passes the faggot in the gutter. The faggot gets up on one elbow and says, ''Yoo-hoo, I'm not mad.'' So why don't you just go home? Why don't you just go home, kiss, make up, eat each other. Whatever the fuck you do. I actually did it. Well, why don't you hit me? Be nice to see if you got the balls to... CHRIS: Oh, God. Oh, shit. (TINGLOFF COUGHING) Why do you always have to do what I tell you? CHRIS: I'm sorry. TINGLOFF: No. -I'll get some ice. -No, wait. (TINGLOFF SIGHING ANGRILY) I still think she didn't mean it. And I still care about her. Well, I care about her, too. (CHRIS WHIMPERS ) Oh, shit. Don't worry, babe, we'll watch the knee. Of course we will. Of course we will. And make sure I have enough magnesium and calcium. Enough of whatever else you think I need. (TINGLOFF SIGHING) -What's that for? -The pool. The swimming pool. You know you're gonna kick, you're gonna do that in water. Use it. I got it. You asshole. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Thanks. I'll make sure I'm out of the apartment by the time you get back from the Pan Ams. -Yeah. Well, you know I can... -No, I... I want to make the move. I... I want to live in a new place. Sure. Fine. I will... Yeah, sure. (THUDS ) (EX CLAIMS PAINFULLY) -You all right? -Yeah. Yeah. The fog is amazing. I think they got it a little overheated in here. It was still dumb. Yeah. How come you swim and then lift? Aren't you worried about getting tight? Not really. You know, if you're a swimmer, you ought to stretch before doing that. Well, I gave up swimming a couple of years ago. I'm playing polo now. Water polo? Yeah, water polo. In that case, you really ought to stretch. In fact, you shouldn?t use that machine at all. Yeah? -What would you suggest I use? -Free weights. Free weights. Yeah, free weights. Yeah, it's better for flexibility, coordination. I'm not too sure about that. Look. You get a better range of motion. Pius, you gotta control the bar. You still don't see it? Well, no, I... I understand. It's just that I've got this job, and I can't lift with the polo team. -What's that got to do with it? -There's nobody to spot me. Tell you what, you spot me and I'll spot you. -What's wrong? -Nothing. Nothing. You mean, right now? Sure. Sure. -That was a five? -Yeah. -Wanna go first? -No. No. You're there. Okay. Ready? Mmm-hmm. Okay. -Aren't you gonna... -Oh, sorry. One, two, three, up. Okay. You want to change them? -The weights? -Oh. No, no, I'll warm up with these. Okay. -Is something wrong? -No. Okay. Okay. One, two, three, up. Don't arch your back. Don't arch your back. Come on. I'm right here. I'm right here. Okay. Last one. Last one. I said don't arch your back. Okay. Okay. Okay, I got it. That's for your shoulders and pecs, not your back. -Won't help to cheat. -Yeah. Thanks. -How you doing? -Hey, fine. (TINGLOFF CHATTERING) TINGLOFF: And make that four 100s, two 200s... -You getting this down? -Yeah, I got it. Okay, and then have them concentrate on the approach. -TINGLOFF: How are you feeling? -Ready to give it a try. Good. Good. Look, there's no point in mincing words. I don't want you and Tory on the field at the same time. Why not? Well, let's put it this way. I don't think you can handle it. Anything to say? I work out with everybody else, or I don't work out at all. I'm too old, too hurt and too tired to put up with this shit. (SIGHING) Ladies, you want to work out, or do you want to watch? If you want to watch, the bleachers are empty. Shit, fuck, piss! Goddamn son of a bitch. (PEOPLE CHEERING) You let these guys come in, act like they're having a good time. They're popping cork bottles on the champagne and drinking beer. (CHATTERING) I told you, don't play down to their level. Then what do they do? They get in the pool, and they're kicking your ass. MAN 1 : Listen... Buddy, shut up. COACH: Here's what's gonna happen, guys. They're probably gonna run a reverse pick to Stites. (CHATTERING) (BELL BUZZING) (WHISTLING) (PEOPLE WHOOPING) (BELL BUZZING) (CHATTERING) Great game. You're awful good losers. -Hey, wait a minute. You like the game? -Yeah, I like the game. But you never should have taken that last shot. -You went to the right again. -Yeah. I know. I don't know why I did that. And it's your shoulders. Your... Never mind. Never mind? You're my expert. What do you mean, never mind? Then they pulled me out of the pool and took me to some kind of recovery room, some tunnel. And they had to delay the ceremony half an hour. -How did it feel? -Oh, terrible. I couldn?t move. No. I mean going to the Games, winning two gold medals? (SIGHING) Two gold medals. I didn't mean the medals. Uh. Sort of walked out there and they hung it around my neck and played the national anthem. And I do remember thinking, ''This is it? ''Twenty thousand meters a day since I was 10, and this is it.'' Any regrets? No, not really. Would you lie to me and tell me it was worth it if it wasn't? I might. No, no, I wouldn?t. It was worth it. What about you? You gonna go to Moscow next summer? You'll go. What do you mean? You haven't even seen me. I've seen people compete. Sometimes you get hints, even right away, about how they'll do. Hints? Benching 150. That's a hint. WAITER: Is everything all right here? Mmm-hmm. Who is that? She's just my roommate, last year. I mean for the last three years, but not anymore. Just drifted apart? (LAUGHS ) Different majors? (CHRIS LAUGHS ) I don't know precisely what happened. -Thanks for lunch. -Sure. -Well... -Thanks again. Oh, hey, thank you. For what? Oh, for making me feel like... -Like what? -Like I'm not in a hurry. Kind of lazy. That's nice. -See you. -See you. CHRIS: Denny! If you're not in a hurry, slow down. (DENNY LAUGHING) My God, girl, what is it? What's gotten into you? What's gotten into you? -Is that all? -(LAUGHING) My God. (LAUGHING) Well, she's right. Although... (MAN CHATTERING ON TV) DENNY: That was a break for the Cowboys. Offensive interference. DENNY: Oh, no. Preston Pearson pushed off. Toast's coming. DENNY: Preston Pearson never pushed off -in his life. -CHRIS: Oh, yeah? He just goes out there and appears, and catches the pass and... Preston Pearson pushed off. (LAUGHING) -Well, I'm sorry, you know. -You couldn?t even see that -from back there. How did you... -Yes, I... Yes, I could see that. I'm sorry. What are you looking through my workout book for? It's workouts. What? You got secret workouts? Yeah. I mean, it's kind of private. You know... -I don't even... -Forgive me. The cover is nice. Did you do that? No, my roommate did it. Why? It's nice. It has pretty yellow flowers. Yeah. Yeah. You're embarrassed about your roommate. Why? Why? (SCOFFS ) Fine. Two greatest-looking girls in San Luis Obispo. It wasn't a secret. Yeah, well, what do you think about that? I think we both like great-looking girls. Don't. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care about any of that. I just... Whatever happens, I just want to believe what you tell me, that's all. Okay? Okay? Okay. There's nothing to tell. We don't see each other anymore, ever. Not ever? CHRIS: Listen. Don't you have a lunch to be at? I mean, I think I recall you saying that you had a lunch date. -Well... -With a small... Little Laurie, right. -But her sister is here from... -Oh, her sister. -From Bakersfield. -Two greatest-looking girls from Bakersfield. (CHRIS LAUGHING) -Can you wait here? -What for? I got to go to the john, for one thing. -Are you going to pee? -Yeah. Oh, good. Come on. Chris, what are you doing? -What are you doing? -Come on. -Come on. -What is... I want to hold it. -(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Wait a minute. -Come on. I've always wanted to pee standing up. Come on. DENNY: (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Chris, see, I don't... Now, come on. CHRIS: Yes, you can. DENNY: (SIGHING) No, I can't. I know you can do it. It will mean a lot to me. CHRIS: Am I aiming right? DENNY: I guess so. CHRIS: Okay. DENNY: Chris, I can't do this. I'm trying, but I can't do this. This isn't gonna work. CHRIS: Of course it is. Just do this. (WATER RUNNING) Thanks. Everything is all right now. (BAND PLAYING) TINGLOFF: What's the matter? The boycott make you lose interest in all this? You need a medal, Chris? Is that it? I'm listening. RICK ON PHONE: We think about you all the time. And we're really proud of you, honey, really proud of you. You know that. -Thank you. -Oh, well, you know, this is not really easy for me to say, but you were right about Tingloff being the coach for you. He really is. Oh, Daddy. Well, your ma and I will be looking out for you tomorrow. You know that. You're not thinking, are you? Okay. Two heats for the hurdles. You're in with Pooch. -Hi, Willie Lee. Pooch. -WILLIE: Hi. -POOCH: Hi. -How are you? You have to own the hurdles. It's your event. You know it, they know it. If you go, say, 13.35 or better, you've got an edge. If not, it'll be uphill all the way. Look at me. -I said, look at me. -Let go of my arm. You're not going to say a word to her. The day you run my race, you run my life. Anyone ever tell you you're a manipulative, sadistic creep? Not in so many words, no. Do I get my turn? (WHISPERING) Look around you, look at everybody. Now imagine how many bodies you all buried to get here. The Games. The javelin, the discus, the shot, they're weapons. Don't kid yourself. You're here to kill anybody that gets in your way, and all the rest is bullshit. You get up from this table now, you're on your own. (SIGHING) I just wanted to say good luck tomorrow. Thanks. You feel good? Sure. How do you feel? Sure. (CHRIS CHUCKLES ) Well... Yeah. I'll see you there tomorrow. (MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) MAN ON PA: ... 13.35. Coming up on the track, the second heat pentathlon 100-meter hurdles. Lane two, Tory Skinner. Lane three, Charlene Benveniste. Lane four, Pooch Anderson. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) MAN 1 ON RADIO: It is Pooch Anderson and Tory Skinner. Pooch Anderson moves out in front. Skinner chases her. It is Anderson and Skinner. The lean at the tape. It is Pooch Anderson, the winner. Tory Skinner is second. -That was awesome. -MAN: What's your name? -Anderson. -Skinner. It sounded like somebody hit a hurdle. -Somebody did. -Who? -Who? -Chris. Sure? Chris? Yeah, she hit the third hurdle. She's right there. -Are you okay? -Yeah. TORY: Are you sure? MAN 2 ON RADIO: She missed her step, she hit a hurdle, and you lose a lot of points. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Pooch Anderson's time is at 13.29. So the standings after first of five events, Pooch Anderson is in front. Fern Wadkins, who had a 13.37 in the first heat, but was limping at the end, is second. Tory Skinner is third, Pam Burnside is fourth. And Chris Cahill a disappointing fifth. She is 69 points back. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) MAN ON PA: That's a foul for Cahill on her third attempt. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Oh, that's another foul in the shot put for Chris Cahill. MAN 2 ON RADIO: Charlie, you have to put your mistakes behind you in this event and think about the next event. And I think Chris Cahill still has her mind on the hurdles. MAN 1 ON RADIO: But what about Pooch Anderson? A PR of 45.07. She is solidify in first place. MAN 2 ON RADIO: And the first two events are her weak events. Her strong events are coming up. She may make this a runaway. MAN 1 ON RADIO: So, after two of five events in the pentathlon, Pooch Anderson in first. The experience of Fern Wadkins, she holds on to second. Tory Skinner is in third. Charlene Benveniste at 6'1'' and 175 pounds, the biggest athlete in the competition, she has a PR of 51.6 in the shot put. She moves up to fourth. Pam Burnside, the 17-year-old high schooler, she is in fifth. And Chris Cahill has now dropped down to sixth. (MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) MAN: Your brother wants to see you. My brother? MAN 1 ON RADIO: I'm looking forward to Edwin Moses. He's coming up next in the 400-meter hurdles. MAN 2 ON RADIO: Well, he is so good I think, if I were a hurdler, I'd find another event. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) Track! What are you gonna do with this? I hit a hurdle. Fouled in the shot put. I guess I've blown it. You don't know that. I had a fight with my coach. He is... Maybe he's right. About what? Killer instinct or whatever. I think right now you just need to remember to look back over your right shoulder. Give you about three more inches of arch. You've been taking to that bastard. Him and his ''whip everybody's ass.'' Hey, could you beat Zenk in the shot? -Oh, come on. -Could you? Well, you're not responsible for how good he is or how much better you are than anybody else. Color of your eyes. All you're responsible for is being a little bit better today than you were yesterday, day before. All you're trying to do is whip your own ass. That's about it. Give it a try. Hey. Today I won that 1,500. I missed two walls. But... Yeah, you and walls. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Next up in the high jump will be Charlene Benveniste. The bar at 1.83. At 6 feet even, if she clears it, it would be a personal best. She's been training in Germany, from the University of Indiana. And she's got it. Charlene Benveniste, over the bar at 6 feet. All right. MAN 2 ON RADIO: And she doesn't really believe it, but it's true. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) MAN 1 ON RADIO: The happiness of the high jump. The only jumper left in the competition, Chris Cahill. The bar now at 6 foot, three and a quarter. That's 1.85. MAN 2 ON RADIO: Showing a little flexibility there. MAN 1 ON RADIO: And she clears. That's a PR by seven centimeters. Almost 3 inches. Cahill will move up in the competition. (PEOPLE CHEERING) MAN 2 ON RADIO: Nearly finesses. Except she hit the bar with her calf coming down, but it didn't drop. Legal jump. And she can't believe it. MAN 1 ON RADIO: And remember, when we heard about the knee injury that she had in training, it was on this event. MAN ON PA: Competition in the pentathlon long jump has been delayed. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Frank, the rain has arrived here in Eugene, Oregon, so we've got a delay in the long jump. Pooch Anderson, she did have a good jump, though, solidify in first place. MAN 2 ON RADIO: But she was very lucky. She got her jump in before it started to rain. She's a speed jumper. She may have been in trouble if she'd had a wet runway. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Chris Cahill, she had her PR in the high jump, and she picked up more than 100 points on the field. Then came right back with another PR in the long jump of 21.8. MAN 2 ON RADIO: That's what's so interesting about the pentathlon is that you can have someone who falls down at the beginning, really, as she did in the hurdles. And then she comes back with personal records, and now she is solidify in second place... (RUSTLING) MAN 1 ON RADIO: Charlene Benveniste, her long jump was 19.10, a little below her standard. MAN 2 ON RADIO: But she wasn't expecting to do that well, because she's only jumped a little over 20 feet. I think, the real story is whether or not Tory Skinner can catch her. MAN ON PA: Ed Tennant to the long jump pit. Ed Tennant report to the long jump pit, please. MAN 1 ON RADIO: All right, here is Tory Skinner. The rain now has stopped, but the runway is still very slick. MAN 2 ON RADIO: And I can't help but think she's gonna have it in the back of her mind that the runway is wet, because she is a speed jumper and it is dangerous. She has a chance of catching Charlene Benveniste because she can jump about a foot further than Charlene. MAN 1 ON RADIO: All right. Here's Tory Skinner. This is the fourth of five events in the pentathlon. MAN 2 ON RADIO: Look how her feet seem to be slipping as she's coming down. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Good height. Distance is not that good. MAN 2 ON RADIO: No. She had good extension and good height, but she didn't have the speed. It didn't carry her far enough. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Her distance, 20'1'': So that means, with now only the 800 meters remaining, Pooch Anderson is in first place, Chris Cahill is in second place, right behind her. Yes, and the real battle is for third place now. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Charlene Benveniste is in third place, but Tory Skinner is now only five points behind her. MAN 2 ON RADIO: Charlene Benveniste, though she is a very large woman, actually has a better time in the 800 meters than Tory. So Tory is going to have to beat Charlene by at least four meters if she's going to make the team. -Lee, what was it? The long jump? -What was what? Tory. Her knee hyper-extended. There's a little swelling, but nothing major. Well, can she run? Well, she says she doesn't want to. Excuse me. Hey, just happened to be in the neighborhood. Hey, well, usually I like people to phone before they come. -Anyway, you want an orange? -No, thanks. How about a piece of ice to chew on? How about a lude? I watched your long jump today. It was really great. You finally got that extension at the end. -Charlene?s gonna go out fast. -No shit. She knows I have to beat her by four meters. So she is really going to push my knee. Yeah. Well, she's not going to go any faster than me. She's got no kick. She'll die. So will you. Don't do it. You've got it made. Don't do anybody any favors. (CHRIS SIGHING) So the knee bother you that much? Does it? -Hey. -Does it? Does it? -Does it bother you that much? -Listen. -Does it? -Listen. Look, there was a time that I just... -Just what? -Just... Just... It's weird. For years you live by the clock, two-twenties, three-thirties, four-forties. And there's never enough time. And suddenly you realize, you have all the time in the world. Forget it. Just fuck it. You've got a race to run, don't you? You're not hurt that bad. You can run. Oh, yeah? Do you know how hurt I am? I know exactly how hurt you are. You can do it. You can run your race. And if you can do it, you have to do it. Why? Why do I have to? (TORY CRYING) Because that's what you are. You have to. You have to. Moscow or no Moscow. Because that's what you are. You got to get off your ass and do it, okay? MAN ON PA: All participants in the women's 800 meter pentathlon. -Report to the clerk, gate 47. -This is it. See you in a minute. MAN 1 ON RADIO: We're ready now for the 800 meters, the final event of the pentathlon. The weather has cleared, the track is dry, it has cooled off. Perfect conditions. And, Charlie, there are two races within this race. The first race is obviously to make the Olympic team. And Charlene Benveniste and Tory Skinner are virtually tied. They're really gonna have to watch each other. Tory's gonna have to beat Charlene if she wants to make the team. The second race is between Pooch Anderson and Chris Cahill. Chris is a better 800 meter runner. She could actually beat Pooch Anderson and win this event. MAN: Take your marks and set. At that time, I'd like to have... MAN ON PA: Down on the infield, please, for the 800 meter pentathlon. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Here are the lane assignments. Charlene Benveniste, currently in third place, is in lane one. In lane two is Pam Burnside, the 17 year-old high schooler. In lane three, Debbie Floyd of Texas A&M. OFFICIAL: Good luck. In lane four, Chris Cahill. She is in second place. MAN ON PA: In women's high jump, Garrison has missed... MAN 1 ON RADIO: In lane five, from Berkeley, is Kim Stone. In lane six, Pooch Anderson. She's been leading throughout the competition. And in lane seven is Tory Skinner. She's in fourth place. Eight hundred meters, this is two laps around the 400-meter track. Gun is up. (GUN FIRES ) (PEOPLE CHEERING) And it's a fair start. Chris Cahill, going out very quickly. And going right with her is Charlene Benveniste. So it is Cahill and Benveniste taking the early lead. MAN 2 ON RADIO: And Charlie, you would think that Chris Cahill would run conservatively and just try to make the Olympic team. The only thing I can think of is that, for these runners, this is Moscow. There will be no Olympic games, and she's trying to win the event. MAN 1 ON RADIO: It is Chris Cahill and Charlene Benveniste down the back stretch. MAN 2 ON RADIO: Charlene tried to go by, but Chris didn't let her get that necessary step. MAN 1 ON RADIO: And dropping back just a bit, setting their own pace, Pooch Anderson and Tory Skinner. TINGLOFF: 28, 29, 30. 29? (MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) MAN 2 ON RADIO: The 200 meters for 29 seconds. That's as fast as the 800-meter women go, the specialists. So they're really going out fast. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Chris Cahill on the inside, Benveniste on the outside. And Benveniste has been running on the right shoulder of Cahill throughout the race. MAN 2 ON RADIO: And this really is a disadvantage. She's running further. She's gotta run three or four meters further per lap. A little jostling there. Some elbowing. Charlene Benveniste must get around her and ahead before she can cut in. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Cahill and Benveniste now have broken contact with Pooch Anderson and Tory Skinner. Bell lap, one to go. MAN 2 ON RADIO: Fifty-nine seconds. That's incredible. I don't think they can hold it to the end. It's just a question now of how much they've got and how much they slow down. Charlene Benveniste, still trying to hang on. (PEOPLE CLAPPING RHYTHMICALLY) Tory Skinner, running a very smart first lap. She was about 65 seconds, she's beginning to gain. Still on the outside, Chris Cahill still holding her. But here comes Tory Skinner. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Pooch Anderson and Tory Skinner closing on the leaders, Cahill and Benveniste. MAN 2 ON RADIO: And they'll all be together when they come off the turn. MAN 1 ON RADIO: It is still Chris Cahill and Benveniste. Anderson closing, as is Skinner. Tory Skinner behind, and she has to catch Benveniste if she is to make the U.S. Olympic team. And Tory Skinner has got herself in a box with Cahill and Benveniste out in front and Pooch Anderson on her right shoulder. MAN 2 ON RADIO: And Tory Skinner really is boxed. Pooch is going by. Tory still boxed. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Tory Skinner hits the opening, and she goes through. MAN 2 ON RADIO: There doesn't seem to be any foul. And it looks like she's going to win this race. MAN 1 ON RADIO: It is Tory Skinner out in front. And it's Tory Skinner beating Pooch Anderson to the tape. Tory Skinner winning the 800 meter. (PEOPLE CHEERING) And here comes Chris Cahill. And she will finish behind Debbie Floyd. And then comes fifth place, Charlene Benveniste. Tory Skinner beating Benveniste by more than four meters. (BOTH PANTING) -What's your name? What's your name? -TORY: Cahill. Cahill. Get away. Are you all right? Are you all right? CHRIS: Tory? TORY: Let's get out of here. MAN 1 ON RADIO: Does that mean that the U.S. Olympic team consists of Pooch Anderson, Chris Cahill and Tory Skinner? And with the boycott at Moscow, they are all dressed up with nowhere to go. Well, what do you think? Well, he's awful cute. For a guy. Are you shitting me? Hey! (PEOPLE CHEERING)
