(waves lapping) (soft music) (dramatic music) (soft music) - [Captain] Glad to be going home, huh, doc? - Yes, very. A little sorry to leave in a way, though. - Think there'll be more trouble on the island? - I think that's over and done with. What I meant was that, well, with all the excitement, I never had a chance to really see the island, you know? Get to know the people. - [Captain] Well, they'll still be there when they retire you. (dramatic music) (men groaning) (water splashing) (guns firing) (Don Ramon grunting and growling) (fire crackling) (man speaking foreign language) (explosion booming) (water lapping) (soft music) (tense music) (dramatic music) (ship horn blowing) - I figure we might as well start getting your gear aboard. Three crates and a couple of smaller boxes, is that right? - [Bill] Right, sorry I'm late. - Okay. Watch those cans. (camera shutter clicking) - [Myra] Welcome aboard, doctor. I'm Myra Russell of the Honolulu Clarion. - MJ Russell? - Right. - [Bill] What are you doing here? - Running down a story. You. - If you're serious, Miss Russell, I'm afraid you've taken a long trip for nothing. - You just proved I didn't. - [Bill] What do you mean? - Well, a man with nothing to hide wouldn't have to be so evasive, and he might even wonder why I traveled 2,000 miles just to meet him. - I guess you're gonna find a story whether there is one or not. - Come on doctor, give me a little credit. I don't rate a syndicated byline for nothing. I wrote you a couple of times, six months ago. - I remember. - I wrote the foundation, too. - Then I suppose they told you what you wanted to know. - What they wanted me to know? They didn't say one word about your first report on Blood Island. - What first report? - The statement you made while at the hospital here, after you were rescued at sea. - Well, I see you two have met. - [Myra] Oh, I'm an old fan of Dr. Foster's. - [Bill] What time do we sail, captain? - Right now. - I was very ill at the time, Miss, uh, it is Miss Russell? I'm sorry we haven't got more time to talk now, but if you're still on mainland-- - Oh, we've got time, doctor. We're fellow passengers on this trip. Look, I don't want to crowd you, but I've put a lot of time and work into this. And I don't believe that what happened on Blood Island, or what may still be happening there, is your exclusive concern. Now, if you want to tell me about it, fine. If not, I'll try not to get in your way. - I'm sure you won't, Miss Russell. Excuse me. - [Captain] Cast off the bow lines! (dramatic music) - That isn't the same village. - No, the tribe moved to this place several months ago. - Why? - Better fishing, maybe. (waves lapping) (camera shutter clicking) (peaceful music) They seemed a bit more friendly the last few times. - Maybe they remember the doctor? - Durangi, isn't it? - [Laida] He is afraid of you. - Why? - The Evil One touched you. The boat in which you sailed away from here sank. All drowned, except you. - Who told him that? - My father and I. We found you there in the sea. We brought you back to the old village. You were nearly dead. - It was you? - My father and I. Now he is gone. The Evil One took him. - Hey, what... - [Laida] Is this your woman now? - No, she's not, and this is a $200 camera. - When I want picture taken, I will tell you. (woman speaking foreign language) (Ramu speaking foreign language) - I have to talk to Ramu. - [Laida] I will get your luggage to government house. They'll be safe. - I appreciate that. I was kind of hoping you'd be glad to see me, old friend. - I have not been glad about anything for a long time. You accomplish nothing by defying the Evil One. - If the beast is still alive, I'll find him. Now, I can use your help if you want to give it, but you won't stop me. - The green men have returned. (dramatic music) - Why don't you do that tomorrow? Even if you get the transmitter working, the chroma section closes at 10. - [Bill] If you're all that well-informed, you probably know I left the foundation some months ago. - Doctor, you're a sterling character and a brilliant scientist, but this cloak and dagger bit just isn't your bag. Here, I brought this for you. - [Bill] Milk? - Fresh out of the can. I've had mine, and our captain favors other kinds of liquid refreshment. - Thanks. I, uh, I thought you were going to bed, if you can call it that. -I am. Right now. Good night. ' Myra? It's very good. - Why doctor, you'll turn my head. (generator humming) (suspenseful music) - [Captain] What happened? - Nothing, maybe. I'll check the generator. Stay here. - Bill? - [Captain] He went out to fix the generator, Miss Russell. Anything I can do? - No. It's... it's all right. - [Captain] Nothing to worry about. - No, I'll just go back to bed. Good night, captain. - Good night. (Myra screaming) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (man groaning) (birds chirping) - No one has come here since the fire. (camera shutter clicking) (dramatic music) - Somebody's been here, all right. - None of my people. I'm sure of it. - Over here! Hand me that flashlight. (dramatic music) Stay close. (Myra screaming) Myra, are you all right? (snake hissing) (gun firing) Can you get UP? - I warned you about the place. - Well, you were wrong. Evil spirits don't spread evil people to steal wires or set traps. The house hasn't been abandoned, it's just been rigged up to scare people, that's all. Was Dr. Lorca's body ever found? - No, I told you, no one, none of my people have come here since the fire. That tunnel under the house must have collapsed and buried him. - But nobody knows for sure? And Don Ramon survived. I think we should keep a watch on this place. We could start tonight. - No. - Ramu, look, don't you see that someone is trying to exploit your fears for a purpose? And they're using the Lopez house. That's why they're so anxious to keep you out of the place. - No, my people would not hear of it. If anything happened, I will be blamed for it. - All right, I'll come back by myself. - No, I'll come with you. - Can you spare a couple of men to guard the government house tonight? Because obviously, we can't bring Miss Russell with us. - [Myra] Oh yes, you can. - Now look, we don't know what we're up against. In case something goes wrong, at least one of us can get back to the mainland. - Hey, now. - [Bill] Yes, captain? - Oh, forget it. - Ramu? - Yes, of course. - Don't mention what we've talked about to anybody. (insects chirping) - Is there a backdoor? - Circle on around there on the left. - Careful. Don't turn on the light. There is some shared laundry chutes over there. - [Bill] What are you doing here? - I already told you, I followed you from the village. - [Bill] You're wasting your time. - I have plenty of time. We're standing in the open. Follow me. (tense music) - Razak? (gun firing) - What is it? (Bill grunting) - [Captain] Doc, Dr. Foster? - Down here. Did you see anybody leave by the back way? - No. There's been some trouble at the village. - Is it Myra? - They took her away. The guard outside was also Killed. The green men did this. - Did anyone see them? - [Ramu] No one. We don't even know how long they've been gone. - Where would they take her? - I do not know. No one knows where the green men come from. There are no tracks of any kind outside, and the ground is hard and dry. - There's one small chance. Razak is mixed up in this. We saw him a little while ago at the Lopez mansion. And there's only one way he could have gotten out: Through the tunnel. (suspenseful music) (water rushing) (insects chirping) - [Ramu] She's not with them. - She will be. (men speaking foreign language and laughing) There's too many of them. - [Captain] Maybe if we picked off the leader? - No, we can't risk it. What do you think now, Ramu? There weren't any green men in that bunch. - [Ramu] What do you want to do? - I'll follow 'em, alone. The captain will go back with you for help. He's got a few guns aboard ship. - And at least three men who know how to handle 'em. Ramu, how many men can you bring along that are willing to fight? - Nine or 10, perhaps a dozen. - We're gonna need all we can get. They got a camp in these mountains somewhere and there's bound to be more of them there. (water splashing) When you get ready to start lookin' for me, start over there, across the stream. I'll leave a trail so you can follow it. Do me a favor captain, huh? Don't stop at any cantinas on the way back. (captain laughing) I said I was traveling alone. - Have you ever been in these mountains before? - Not these mountains, no. - Well, I have. (water rushing) (suspenseful music) (Razak grunting) (man speaking foreign language) (rope crunching) (guard snoring) (guard shouting in foreign language) (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Run! (guns firing) - Come on! (Myra screaming) (Myra shouting) - Help! Oh no, no, no, please help! (gun firing) (man speaking foreign language) - They're going back. (Myra whimpering) - Oh, oh please, don't! Oh please, don't! (Myra sobbing) (men speaking foreign language) (water rushing) - At sunrise, the men who stayed behind will start looking for us. One of us has to go back to the village and leave a trail for them to follow. - No, we'll lose Myra. - No, the ground here is wet. And it will not be hard to pick up their trail. As soon as you have led the men away from you, I'll start to follow Razak. - No, not a chance. You're going back to the village. Look, for one thing, I don't know if I can find my way back here again. And for another, I don't want to take a chance on you falling into Razak's hands. - The risk is the same, whether I go or stay. - Maybe. But I've got a hunch that they want to talk to me. I don't think they'll hurt me. Not now, anyway. - Why not? - [Bill] Just a hunch. We got about four hours 'til daybreak. You better try and get some rest. (soft music) - [Laida] How long have you known that woman? - [Bin] Who, Myra? I met her the day we set for the mainland. Why? - She likes you. - I'm glad to hear it. - You don't care? - You know, considering the time, the place, and the situation, you can sure think of some funny things to talk about. - Why? Love is always interesting, is it not? I know about the woman who was with you the last time, and how she died. Do you blame yourself for it? - It wouldn't make a difference if I did, would it? - Did you love her? - Yes. - How long has it been since you were with a woman? - I could ask you how you meant that, but I won't. Now, I'm gonna get some sleep. (dramatic music) (soft music) I'm sorry. [ Feel ks & fool. (suspenseful music) - Have the woman brought to my quarters. (dramatic music) Good morning, Don Ramon. [ Hope you slept well? Believe me, I know how difficult this must be for you. I cannot pretend to be surprised at your anger. I can only promise it won't be for much longer. How much longer depends a great deal on your attitude. You and I both know that you're now fully capable of rational thought and speech, with reasons which elude me, you choose to remain silent. And really, it gains you nothing. Your personal feelings towards me shouldn't enter into it at all. Whatever you may think of me, I'm still your only chance, as I have been for a long time. Think about this, I beg you. - You're Dr. Lorca? - Yes. And you're Myra Russell. Reporter for the not-so distinguished Honolulu Clarion. I don't suppose it's necessary to ask what bought you to this island? - I might ask what you want with me? - I'm not sure I can give you a straight answer to that question right now. The immediate reason for your abduction was a tactical one. I hadn't counted on meeting your friend, Dr. Foster, again. He is a somewhat reckless sort of person, and I felt that if he was really bent on seeing me, I should give him good reason to approach him with caution. - You may have taken a great deal of trouble for nothing, doctor. - Yes, well, it wouldn't be the first time. You must be tired and hungry. I'm afraid our guest facilities here are somewhat limited, Miss Russell. But we'll try to make you as comfortable as possible. Razak. Razak will attend to your needs. - Doctor, I think there's some things I ought to explain. - We'll have plenty of time to discuss them later. Good day. (suspenseful music) (man screaming) (tense music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (man groaning) (choking) (Ramu speaking foreign language) (woman speaking foreign language) - It's all right. - [Captain] Where's Bill? - He went on ahead. We must hurry. He's in great danger at the moment. (Ramu speaking foreign language) - [Ramu] Let's go. - [Dr. Lorca] Where are your men? - Dead... - And Dr. Foster? The foreigner! How many are with him? - I don't know. It was too fast. I saw only one man, the foreigner. And my orders were to take him alive. I couldn't do it alone. (Razak shouting and grunting) - No, Razak, we don't need to send out anymore men. I expect Dr. Foster to arrive very shortly. It's a pity. We've never been able to find a good cook willing to work under the, uh, unusual conditions we offer. Of course, living comfortably isn't one of our main concerns here. - Keeping out curious outsiders being more important? - Yes. You find that reprehensible, evidently. - I saw a kind of jailhouse outside. I didn't get much of a look at-- - We have a number of other equally interesting features here, that you'll notice soon enough. All of which will serve to confirm conclusions that you already formed before you came. - And what are your personal views on murder, doctor? - If I'm caught before I've completed my experiments, or after I've completed them and failed, I shall be regarded as a conscienceless, sadistic mass murderer, and be dealt with accordingly. If I succeed, I shall be a selfless, dedicated hero of humanity, beyond a shadow of a doubt. And whichever way it goes, there will be a solid body of evidence to support either judgment. Beyond that simple notion, I have no personal views on murder, or conscience, or justice. How is the patient? (Razak grunting) The operation will go on as scheduled. Seven o'clock in the morning. Would you care to go for a little walk, Miss Russell? - [Myra] No thank you, Dr. Lorca. I'd like to rest. - As you wish. It was very kind of you to join me here tonight. And I'm grateful for it. Razak will take you back to your quarters. Good night. - [Bill] What's on the other side of that mountain? - No one knows. This whole region is taboo. It is the world of the Evil One, it is-- - Just more mountains, that's all. My father did not believe in taboo. He brought me here for the first time when I was a little girl. Between that mountain and the next one is another plain, beside a river. - Well, that's where their camp is. That's where they've taken Myra. There's a narrow pass over there between those two low ridges. And a trail that starts about there that leads into it, and then over the top. They've got an outpost guarding the path from the top, so we don't stand a chance of getting in that way. Hmm, we're gonna have to think of something else. Early tomorrow morning, I'm gonna start out up that trail. Alone. If it is Lorca out there, I don't think he'd have me killed without trying to figure out what I'm doing here. - And if it is not Lorca? - I think it is. I'm wiling to gamble on it. He let me get this far. I think there's a reason for it. - [Captain] So what's the rest of the plan? - Tomorrow night, just as soon as it gets dark, the rest of you, cross the clearing single-file just as quietly as you can, and climb that side of the mountain, about a couple of hundred yards to the left of the pass. Now, when you get to the top, captain, you and your men go down to the river and cross it and try to infiltrate the camp and find out where Myra and I are being held before it gets light at daybreak. Ramu, you and your men hit the outpost at the top of the pass, and make just as much noise about it as you can. When the action starts, captain, you try and get us sprung, if you know where we are. (dramatic music) Still angry with me? - I was never angry with you. Uncomfortable, perhaps, but not angry. But, very uncomfortable. - I'm not a good man, Laida. But I don't think I could make love to you without binding myself. I'm not ready for that. - I ask for no promises. - I know. - You are good, and you are a man. I'll be sad for a long time that you are not mine. Better go away now. You are making me uncomfortable again. (tense music) (liquid burbling) (electronic warbling) (tense music) (electronic warbling) (liquid burbling) - The donor is dead. Reactivate the artificial head. (electronic warbling) Razak, you go. It may be our visitor. (Bill breathing heavily) - Is the doctor in? (prisoners groaning) Well doctor, frankly, I was kind of hoping you'd retired. - [Dr. Lorca] You never cease to surprise me, Dr. Foster. This is quite an impressive gambit you've opened. - You all right? - Oh, Dr. Lorca's been a most obliging host. - Oh, he's never anything but. - What brings you to Blood Island this time, doctor? - Well basically, I came here to gather some more information about your experiments. Your old experiments, that is. - That is before you began to suspect that I was still alive. After that, you came into the jungle to hunt me down, and kill me? - Hardly that, it never occurred to me to even come this far until you had Miss Russell kidnapped. That's not too strong a word, is it? - It covers the situation. - [Bill] May I ask why you did that? - It was rather, uh, a spur of the moment decision. It seemed a little easier to arrange than kidnapping you. - It might have been easier all around to just invite me here. - Ah, now. You know what a devious mind I have, doctor. I would never think of that. - I believe you have something to show me, Dr. Lorca. - Certainly. If you'll be good enough to come with me. The three of us survived the explosion of the cave by the merest fluke. Most of the blast was directed outwards, you see, so that the cave was heavily damaged. But as you must have noticed, the tunnel that I had built from the basement of the Lopez house, hardly touched at all. Fortunately, Razak was there to help me. He carried me back into the house. Don Ramon, as you know, escaped. Razak nursed me back to health. I have, over the years, given him a rather sketchy medical education, but enough of one apparently to save my own life. How long ago was that? Less than a year, surely. This is what I have managed to do in that time. About three months ago, we finally managed to find Don Ramon and restrain him. That wasn't too difficult. He was more dead than alive. This recovery was slow, but even then, it was clear that his predilection for violence was in no way diminished. This is how I stabilized the situation. It took a great deal of effort to obtain the equipment I needed, but uh, it was done. One promising result of this phase of the experiment is that the pernicious side-effects of chlorophyll on the body itself had been arrested. And every time, the body's alive, but it's merely vegetating. It cannot be activated without a guided intelligence, which cannot be provided by a mechanical device. On the other hand, Don Ramon's head cannot, as yet, be safely returned to his body. - So you've gone back to experimenting with human beings again? - Oh, yes. Your original judgment has been thoroughly vindicated. I'm madder than ever. - [Bill] It may surprise you to know, doctor, that I'm not as sure of that as I once was. - Humoring him won't get you anywhere. - I'm not trying to. You see, it's all very well to have principles, as long as you never have to fight for them. When that happens in the kind of world that we live in, you're liable to run into a few unpleasant surprises, like getting your throat cut by the very people that you're fighting for. - You'll allow me a few reservations on that statement, doctor. - You're entitled to them. The foundation fired me six months ago. ' Yes'? My information was that you resigned. - Let's say I wasn't offered much of a choice. - Razak, will you escort Dr. Foster and Miss Russell to their fortress, and see to the doctor's needs? Perhaps we could have another talk later. What did you think of that, Don Ramon? Our Dr. Foster seems to have grown a little more complicated, hasn't he? Be as stubborn as you like, old friend. The day may come when I no longer have need of you. - The day may come soon... Lorca... (dramatic music) - [Bill] How'd it go? - What difference does it make? - [Bill] Well, what did he Say? - Well, he made what he called a practical suggestion. He, uh, suggested that I become his woman for a while and try to give him a child. Nothing personal, mind you, just mutual insurance. - [Bill] What? - It came to him as kind of a passing thought over dessert. As things stand, he couldn't very well let me go and trust me to keep my mouth shut. On the other hand, he wouldn't want to have me killed. Whereas, if he had some kind of pledge-- - I get the picture. - Oh, that's not all. He Said that if I didn't think that that was such a hot idea, it'd be okay to have a child by you instead. - That's quite a mind he's got. He cuts right to the bare bones of things. - If you are laughing at me, I swear I'll kill you. - I'm not. He's not going to lay a hand on you, Myra. I promise you that. - Well, what was all that stuff you were giving him this morning? - You think I walked into this slaughterhouse on the chance that Lorca might have a job for me? Are you as crazy as he is? - You don't have to yell at me. - Well, talk sense, then. - [Myra] Why did you come? - For better reasons than you give me credit for. - I'm too scared to think straight. - Myra, I'll get you out of here. Just don't fall apart on me because I'm gonna need your help. - [Myra] Nothing personal on that either. - If you say so. - I never thought I could be this frightened. Listen, next time you charge in and decide to rescue some knuckleheaded damsel in distress, you better think twice. (soft music) (upbeat gentle music) (suspenseful music) (Razak grunting) (prisoners whimpering and breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (man grunting) (man speaking foreign language) (goat bleating) (man speaking foreign language) (electronic warbling) (water rushing) (dramatic music) (explosion booming) (guns firing) (explosion booming) - [Dr. Lorca] What? Razak, there's a flashlight in the cabinet behind you. Ry Start the auxiliary generator. (explosions booming) (guns firing) (man groaning) - Stay here! (men groaning) (guns firing) (electronic warbling) - Go out and stop them. Razak, kill Dr. Foster first. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (Myra groaning) - Let go of me! (man screaming) (man gasping) (man groaning) (prisoners groaning) (Laida speaking foreign language) (prisoner groaning softly) - It's either jammed or disconnected. - [Captain] The only thing we've got that'll jar that open is a charge of dynamite. - Set it up. There's solid rock in there. There's no other way in or out. (tense music) - No... - We can talk now, Lorca... (Dr. Lorca groaning) Talk to me now, Lorca... - Stop this at once! Stop before you destroy yourself! Get back! (Don Ramon laughing) (electricity crackling) (explosion booming) - Let's get outta here! Let's get outta here! (dramatic music) (fires crackling) (explosion booming) - [Ramu] Doctor, those papers you took, what will you do with them? - Nothing at all, I hope. Come on.
