This is the result of my actions and it could cost me my life, Baby, Baby, what are you doing here? Don't worry, baby, You want my sister? I lend her to you, For real? For real, no problem, Let's start over, okay? -Yeah? -Yeah, There's just one problem, What problem? Carlos Manuel, Carlos Manuel is here!? This validates the saying: You're free to take your own decisions, but prisoner of the consequences, Here, my story begins, Almost four months ago, On my 33rd birthday, and starting what would be the year that would change my life, Hey, Pablo's here, look! That's me, Samuel Ignacio Tuarre, Born in a town near San Cristobal, and with a head full of dreams rather than studies, With some work, and knowing the right people, I managed to get all of this, That's my wife, Isabel Vega, the heiress of everything that pays this, The few times she's not deep in her job, the magic that made me fall in love with here flourishes again, But the more money, the less time of magic, On this day, the seed that would produce the tree of bad decisions in my life was seeded, Tell me the truth, And I mean it, Me or my sister? My love, still with this? You, my love, A thousand times you, Cantinflas! -How are you doing? -I'm fine, as you can see, You're alone, in a day like this? Te night's still young, Behave, Him who behaves doesn't enjoy, and I like enjoying a lot, God damn,,,! Hey, my dear! You're an asshole, you left me hanging, -But now I'm here,,, -Yeah,,, Damn it! I had hoped I didn't have to see that douche bag's face, He's just an asshole, I can't believe I got jealousy to you because of him, Hello? Where are you? Hi,,, baby? I'm here, at the lobby, -I was just told you were here, -No, I'm at the drug store! Don't be crazy! Please, go home and don't look for me, I'll go with you as soon as I'm done here, Carlos Manuel is out there, Where? There, in the lobby, he's looking for me! Hey man, I'm done here, pick me up, Monica! Let's get out trough here, Through where?! -Through the window, baby, Come on, -Monica! Please, my love, You know I'm yours only, There comes the speech, I know it from memory, it's the same everyday, "A day just like today,,," A day just like today, a thanksgiving day, it brings me joy to be around my loved ones, all of you, Together we've lived sour and sad moments, but also good and happy ones, And those are what prevails in my memory, and what let's us celebrate year after year this day together, The happiest day of my life is the day her family decided to come here, from Mexico, and start their business here, That's it! That's how you get drunk! Easy, easy, That's right, my friends! If it weren't for the trust and love of Isabel, I wouldn't be living this life, I also want to thank my brother in law, Monica and Carlos Manuel, who are a very,,, very important part of our family and our company, And everybody, thank you for coming, let's toast for happiness, and for our paths to stay in the way of good health and spiritual wealth, Cheers, -Cheers, baby, -Cheers, What's the matter? Admiring the picture, I didn't know you liked the sea and the ships, I think Carlos Manuel doesn't even swim, You're wrong, And, besides, I wasn't admiring the ship that my sister gave you, One of these days, when you go fishing, can I come along? Sure! You say a day and,,, What's up, Great party, buddy, Thanks for always inviting me and Monica, Of course, you guys are family, I was telling Samuel that I wanted him to invite me to his boat, Not that I like fishing, but I like the sea, Well, baby, listen to me, I rather be invited to this kind of activities, because me and the sea aren't exactly friends, -So boring,,, -Not boring- now, if you want to go, you can, even better, that way I stay here playing golf or something else, but in mainland, You and I are the same, I also like staying in mainland and, in fact, I don't even know why I bought that boat, Sometimes, Samuel says he goes fishing, but I feel he goes and loiters around, What a crazy mind you have, But alright, you know, any day, you're invited to a great fishing day, Don't leave me hanging, Dare to invite her and you'll have a problem with me, But she's your little sister, Half sister, So you've been warned, Did you like how the party ended up? Yeah, my love, Can't complaint, You really know how to organize those moments, Not just those moments, There's also big scenes happening in here, No, I'm sorry, but I'm too tired, maybe tomorrow, You're not still upset about your sister's thing, No, my love, That's ridiculous, that would be the straw, So,,,? I'm tired, I'm going to sleep, What the heck? Damn, I interrupt something? No, no,,, I was sending an email, and,,, Then I was going to take a shower and go sleep, I'm a bit tired, My love, Please, forgive me, I still can't get that out of my head, Baby, you can't keep up like this, Life goes on, And I read that one out of four women lose a baby in their life, The only thing we can do is keep trying, and you'll see, in no time, the house will be full of kids, Alright, my love, I will try, I promise, -Okay? -Okay, Okay, I'll go to the bedroom, Hi, Sorry, I'm late, Don't worry, I knew you would be late, -Why do you say that? -Because you're always late, I just received an email about a retreat that helps put your problems in perspective, Are you going? Let's go, I would love yo, but I don't have the time, Unlike you, I have a job, You always, always wanting to degrade me, No, no, it wasn't my intention, Carlitos is a good man, He's nice, hard at work, dedicated,,, Yeah, of course, -If he's so good, why don't we change? -For Samuel? Samuel is a disaster, Look, Moni, I only want good things for you, And I feel that you still lack maturity, that you still act like a child, Sometimes, I don't know why I do an effort to keep you as a sister, But if the one putting effort is me, Look, don't worry about the money, I pay, Okay? I've got to go, Yeah, of course you pay everything, What a sister that I got, What's the matter, Carlitos? Listen to what I'm about to say, Samuel, If I find out that Monica is cheating on me I swear for my mother I'll kill her, I work day and night to keep this company the way it is, and now Monica wants to do a fucking spiritual retreat, I don't know why the fuck she wants to do that, But I'm telling you, if I find out she's cheating on me, I'll kill her, Hey, come on, calm down, How's Monica cheating on you? Where did you get that from? That's no slouch, dude, that's a serious accusation, Besides, I thought you had solved that already, Samuel, you know how Monica is, Don't play dumb, Okay, man, look, Come to the house, calm down, and talk to Monica, dude, And if you still don't solve the problem, then divorce her, You can't live with that damn anxiety, that she's cheating on you, Would it be me, I would have dumped her long ago, You're right, But this is the last time her and me talk about this, Next time, I pick up my bags, Hi, Monica? Look, I think the blower has an issue, I felt it last night, when I turned it on and off, Besides, it definitely has problems, the cabin smells like gas, Yeah, but that's not the blower, Try it out, see that's not it, Bro, close that, Help me up, You're early, As soon as they check the boat, we're leaving, There's no one waiting for me, anyway, I even talked to Isabel so that she doesn't miss me, Wait, Isabel told you to come with me? No, dummy, I called her because I'm leaving for a spiritual retreat she recommended me for a few days, But,,, If you don't want me to go, no problem, No, no problem, As I said, the mechanic is checking the boat, As soon as he's done, we're leaving, I've always liked this place, It reminds me of my daddy, Take a seat, Place your shoes over here, I'll try it out and let you know, Boss, we'll have to change the blower, But go on, that works as is, I'll fix it tomorrow, Alright, Sorry for giving you a check, but I added a little extra, Okay, thanks, What are you doing here? Who are you looking for? Damn it, Isabel, who are you looking for!? I'm sick of your damn jealousy! For real, I'm fed up, This isn't life, No, it's just that I came here to bring you you're cellphone charger, so that if something happens, you can call me, No, you're fully aware I've got a charger that I never take out of the boat, You came here hoping to surprise me with a girl, so stop with the bullshit, I'm sorry, Have a good trip, The beach is super ugly! You want some champagne? Yeah, -Cheers, -Cheers, Well, that beach is called,,, ,,, the forbidden dreams beach, And that white thing? What is it? That's Puerto Viejo, -Well, let's go there, -No, no, that's not,,, No, Puerto Viejo is a kilometer of open sea away, and,,, it gets really dangerous there, Well, let's better not then, Let's better stay here, Hey, hey, hey, So,,, -Forbidden dreams? -That's right, If the boot fits you,,, Now I'm the dummy, No,,, You're a lot of things, but dumb is not one of them, Cheers, For this retreat, Your call really took me off guard, I didn't thing you would say yes, You dummy, Look for the champagne, and see you at the beach, And hurry up! Cheers, Cheers, Because, sometimes, it's better not to say anything, You are free to take your own decisions, but prisoner of their consequences, You've got to go back home today? Well, I don't have to, but I should, Isabel and I are not on out best moments, and not coming back would be Not coming back would just make things worse, What could happen to the marriage,,, of my perfect little sister? I'm not sure if this is the best time to talk about that, Besides, a lot of things,,, She doesn't have the fault, Obvious! Come on, my dummy, Even after what happened today, I'm still your sister in law, That sounds really weird, What's that? Shit, that's the fire alarm, The fire alarm!? Where does that smoke come from!? Get off! That's fire! You'll catch on fire! Go to the front! go and stay there! Quickly, go! Watch out, you're going to burn! -I'll jump in the water! -No! Don't jump! Wait! Damn it! -What happened!? -Come! What are we going to do!? -What are we going to do!? How will we go back,,,!? -Hey, calm down! Calm down! Calm down, okay? Stay here, I'll be back, Okay? Don't leave me, No no, I'll be right back, I need to go set the fire off, Go there, where we were, and dig a big hole where we can bury ourselves,, okay? -And what for? What for? -What? Because mosquitoes and insects will eat us if we don't bury ourselves, It's okay, look, two holes, like this, do this, Two big holes, okay? Okay? And calm down, Go over there, and I'll be right back, okay? Please, leave a message, Samuel, it's me, I called to know if everything's okay, I'm worried, Please call me, okay? Don't go fishing today, Stay with me, I'm going to get dressed, Maybe another day, Besides, today, I'm the one that doesn't feel good, Exactly, if you don't feel good, stay here, today, I'm the one that doesn't feel good, Exactly, if you don't feel good, stay here, Isabel, I don't want to start an argument, Today's not the day, Besides, I've been waiting for over a year after the loss, I think you can wait one day, right? You think it's easy to let something like that go? I'm not even going to answer, Samuel! Samuel! Samuel! What!? Inside or outside? What happened? Didn't I tell you to dig the holes inside that thing? It's scary in there, My shovel,,, Does it itch there? It itches everywhere, you're right, There, there, relax, just relax your arm, Okay,,, Okay, You don't have to put it near my face like that, Speak of the devil,,, Man, guess what? How was our fishing day? A shit show, the boat got on fire, What? Where are you? Forbidden Cay, Shit, mosquitoes are killing me, Let me call the coastguards, they get there before I do, That cay isn't too far from Caldera Bay, No, no, this has to stay between us, Why is that? Who are you with, Samuel? With Monica, You're fully aware that I can't sail without the navy's permission this late, Besides, I don't have enough fuel, so bury yourselves so that don't eat you alive and I'll take care of it, Yeah, yeah, we're at it, Alright, How much time do you think the boat has left? I don't know, man, because it was leaking water, but I don't think it sinks completely, that's why they have a false bottom, right? I'll see what I can do, or we'll have to wait till tomorrow, and look for the flare, don't let it get wet, Damn, fucking flare, I knew I forgot something, Well, go back, because without it, I won't find you, Okay, -Damn it, -What happened? -Samuel's boat caught on fire, -What!? -But I can call the navy, we can do something, -No, we can't, -But,,, why can't we? -Because he's with Monica, -Monica? -With Monica, Our Monica? How many other Monicas do you know? Oh god,,, Cantinflas is coming for us, He'll try to sail now, but if not, he'll come tomorrow, Cantinflas!? Don't move so much! Yeah, Cantinflas, What? You want me to call Isabel? OR call the coastguards so they come and rescue us, and I have to make a report, with everything involved? You want your name to show up in a report? Because I don't, Let's see if we can find some gas, What will I tell Carlos Manuel? He'll find it weird that I haven't called or texted him or anything, Weren't you on a retreat? That's what I told him, Then here, take it, text him, and tell him that you're in the retreat, and there's no signal, or I don't know, the priests don't let you, but tomorrow morning, you'll call him, Hey, man, What's this? I need to get to my boat, Look, the docks are closed and you know it, And the navy is really picky lately, Last night, a drug shipload came in and the shootout was no slouch, Listen, man, I need to get to my boat because I've got an emergency, Where's the navy's permit? Look, man, listen, you've got two options: You either let me pass and help me find gas, or you can get off the way and let me do what I want, those are your options, so what will it be? Oh my god, I imagine there'll be some cash for me? A lot, Whatever you want, Go in, You better do, There? Okay, Now let's bury you again, Try not to move anymore, Lower your arms, Lower- Come on, your arm, And also your legs, bury them well, Easy, easy, it's for your good, Okay? Take it easy, I'll be right back, No, I don't want to stay here! -I'm very scared, please! -Monica, Monica,,,, There's no other way, okay? I've been waiting for you a while, I can't be playing games at noon, Come, What's that? It's chocolate, So you spread it on me, and eat me, Between Samuel and your sister, they have way over complicated my day, I don't have anything to do with them, Samuel! Samuel, you have a call! Samuel? I've been trying to reach you the whole day, I've got the tax declaration ready, I'm just waiting for your signature, So call me as soon as you hear this, Samuel! What the heck is going on now? Samuel, there's someone here! Don't worry! That's what I get for being so horny, Can I know what the hell is wrong with you? I'm scared, mosquitoes are stinging me, that fucking phone won't stop ringing, and there's someone there, -Monica, there's nobody, -There's someone, The only thing here is a donkey, everybody knows him, His name's Ramon, Well, if there's a donkey, maybe there's a road, Monica, we're in a Cay, We're surrounded by water, As much as you walk, the only thing you'll find is water and a fucking donkey, Shit, it's Isabel, What are you going to do? What am I going to do? Nothing, What can I do? Come on, bury yourself, The gas pump switch is inside of there, Why don't we break the lock? -That's not the problem, -Then what is it? That the navy will realize, they're sleeping back there, Well, we break it without making too much noise, here, give me that, Careful, careful, Can I know why are you ducking? We go somewhere else to look for gas then? -Hey, who's there? -Fuck! This is so romantic, This is the kind of thing Carlos Manuel would come up with, Monica, Would you do me a favor and shut the hell up so that we don't get swarmed with mosquitoes? Because mosquitoes listen Monica,,, Okay, alright, I'll shut up, I can't take this anymore! What's the matter with you now? I can't take this anymore! This is a Chinese torture, I'll go to the boat, And if it sinks, then,,, I'll go with it, But I can't take this, I told you it's too dangerous to spend the night there, It's better to wait until daylight, Well,,, I told you I can't take this any longer, but,,, the boat seems a bit farther away, Fuck! I think the anchor got off, Shit, look, come help me pack this, Come on, come, -Stay there and watch out for anyone, -Got it, Hurry, This thing is heavy, -Let's go, -Hold on, -It's Isabel, -What? Tell me, Isabel, Sorry I bother you, but I'm so worried, I don't know anything about Samuel, he went fishing, and look at the time, and he hasn't come back yet, Don't worry, you know he always shows up, If anything happens, let me know, Alright, thank you so much, Alright, let's go, -Who are you calling now? -Wait up a second, Asshole, call your wife, she's worried something bad happened to you, Let's go, What are we going to do? I don't know, The anchor got off, And what does that mean? That means the current is taking us to open sea, And that's good or bad? It's terrible, Why? Because on open sea, we won't be alive for even half an hour, on the boat or in the water, What are we going to do? Look,,, Let's go to the cabin, because even if it's hot as hell, we can at least get some sleep, And what if this sinks and we're inside of there? Look, do whatever the fuck you want, I'm going to sleep, Yeah, tell me, Carlitos? No, I'm just calling Samuel, It's job related, Well, he went fishing but he won't answer me, I'm starting to get worried, If he doesn't respond in a few hours, I'll have to call the navy, Well, alright, let me know if you know anything, Hey, and Monica? Monica is out on a spiritual retreat, Sorry, that was my idea, Don't worry, Let me know if you hear from Samuel, Yeah, of course, Thanks, Monica, It's me, I'm not fine and I wanted to talk to somebody, Call me as soon as you can, okay? I love you, What the fuck am I doing here? I should just jump ship and swim to Miami, God, what a fucking asshole, 'The hell am I gonna do? Letty, What can I help you with? Localize Samuel's phone, Samuel's phone is at the coordinates 25, 34, 65, Carlitos, I'm sorry to wake you up, but I need you to help me with something, Is this enough to get there? I suppose it is, but we need to try, If I see we're at half tank, we go back and try again in the morning, Samuel, Samuel! Samuel! What is it!? What!? I'm sick of this! I have claustrophobia! Oh my god, you're bothersome as fuck, You frame it like it was my fault! I'm here because I wanted to be with you, You could be a little more condescending, Please, Cantinflas, don't leave us here, Untie us, Remember checkpoint 4 has its lights out, Alright, You're wasting your time, none of it works, Well,,, I don't know about us, but,,, your boat is completely busted, Yeah, But you can fix anything in this life, What a sexy captain on the boat, Stay still, this ain't the time, Baby, relax, we'll find them in no time, Can we make a technical stop? I wish I could make a technical stop, Check back there, see if there's movement on the docks, Yes, captain, Look, this will help you with the stings, Thank you, Shit, I'm running out of battery, Who are you calling? I'm reading a message from Cantinflas, What does it say? That Isabel is looking for me like the devil, And you're not going to call her, And tell her what? "Baby, the boat caught on fire because I was making love to your sister", "Love,,," That's what you call it, You prefer I use another word? No, no,,, It's okay, And you know what? It's okay if Isabel suffers a bit, She always had it really easy, That's what she says of you, Alright, tell me, -Is that your boat? -Yeah, that's me, I'm there in 20 minutes, Cantinflas is coming for us, he's coming for us! Alright, but look, hurry up because there's a ton of breeze, the anchor didn't touch rock bottom, and we're adrift, man, and I think we're close to Puerto Viejo, Puerto Viejo? That's less than a kilometer away from open sea, I don't think I got enough gas, Look, Listen to me well, tie the anchor with any rope that you can find, because if you get to open sea, you're fucked, Yeah, we already did that, but hurry, if you don't get here, we're fucked, Hello? Hello? What did he tell you? The anchor got off, Fuck, the battery died, And your cellphone? It ran out of battery, Really? Now, this is good, no phones,,, Here, take a zip, see if that helps you sleep, I hear you really worried that we're going to open sea, and the thing is,,, I'm also very scared, Don't worry, we'll do something, I never thought that I would pray to,, seeing Cantinflas again, Life takes many turns, That's right, What happened? We used half the gas, we have to go back, But we can keep looking, there's still gas, No, baby, we have just enough to go back, Hold on, What's the matter? I'm either crazy or I'm hearing an engine, -Where? -Wait, Bring me the flare! The flare! Looks like his phone is off, the machine starts right off, And what are we going to do? We'll leave him in the middle of nowhere? Baby, there's nothing I can do now, Look,,, We go back, fill up the tank and come back tomorrow morning, But I clearly heard you tell them not to go to open sea, so they must be near here, Alright, baby, but there's nothing we can do, If we go on, we will also need rescue, So let's go, Work, god damn it,,, Cantinflas! Wake up, Monica, it's morning, Where the hell is Cantinflas? Shit,,, What happened? That's Puerto Viejo, So!? We're 10 to 15 minutes away from open sea, Go ahead, Dominican army, -Go ahead, Dominican army, the Isabela boat,,, -And why don't we go swimming to the docks? Wait, we need to think, hold on and let me think, Monica, Let me think, Because if we go swimming right now, there's a problem, the current is too strong, -I say we go, let's try it, -Wait, Monica, let me think, Wait a second, Here, help me out, Let's go, Okay, now,,, Up, up, up! Okay, hold it there, I'm going down, Shit, it's filling up with water, Come, get it down again, Okay, okay, we need to make a raft, -We need to make a raft, Take this,,, -How so? Okay, tie up any life-jacket you see together, How are we doing? Come on, faster, You've got to be quick, Tie that one up, -I'm trying, -Okay, Okay, we tie this one up, Okay, There's that, Come on Monica, hurry up, the water's leaking, Oh my god, How far do you think they can be? With the sea how it is? Like 45 minutes away of Puerto Viejo, -Yeah? -Yeah, Baby, come here, Load all of that in the cabin, and check that everything's off, Isabel? I'm going to report Samuel as lost, How lost? And why haven't you called the navy, the press, everybody? Hey, calm down, We're not sure yet this is an emergency, and I don't want no press here, Look, these are the last coordinates, But this is from his cellphone, right? Yeah, the last time they registered activity was at 10:30 pm, But do we know if he tried to call someone? That doesn't come up on the report, Well, maybe he called the navy, or even you, No, he didn't call me, -Okay, Can I keep this? -Yes, but, what for? Where are you going? -To search for him, what else? -Then I'm coming with you, No, no, Isabel, it's better if you and Carlitos go to the navy and tell them what's going on, The whole team is ready for rescue, If I find him, I'll tell you right away, okay? -Okay, let me know, please, -Right away, Go, go, What happened? -Did they find out? -They didn't just find out, they even got the coordinates, and they're talking to the navy, This got fucked up, Turn it on, I'll release it, -Are we safe? -No, we're not safe, Well, I want to wear one of these, No, we'll use those to rest, now, we're going to swim, okay? Get in the water, I think the current is pushing us the wrong way, Are you sure it was here? Because these aren't the coordinates, Those are the coordinates that Isabel gave me, they should be here, The anchor must have fallen off, And what does that mean? That the current will take him to Puerto Viejo, in that direction, -Over there? -Yes, over there, Let's go there, -But why there? -Because otherwise, he'll get to open sea, and that will be it, -Are you sure? -More than ever, Look, by the coordinates you gave me, he must be here, near Puerto Viejo, Give me a second, Have you heard anything from Monica? No, I haven't talked to her, But she's in the retreat, right? Yeah, she texted me last night, told me we would talk today, but I've been calling her all day, and she doesn't answer, Well, with how clumsy she is, maybe she forgot the charger, Clumsy? I hope that's it, Take a breath, because we're still too far, so rest, Rest, -Shit! -What's the matter!? -What's the matter!? -I think a jellyfish stung me, -Wait, hold on, hold on, -What's the matter!? Hold on tight! Somebody, help us! Help! Somebody! Help me! Thank you, my love, so nice, Cheers for you, You're so gorgeous, I don't want you to cut your hair anymore, I love it like this, I want you like this all the time, your hair, your beard,,, The most beautiful man, It's Isabel, Talk to me, Isabel, You found him? No, not yet, Tell me, Carlitos, The captain says we're going to land, they'll send a helicopter, Cantinflas, we'll go search for him on helicopter, You keep looking, and tell me if you know anything, Okay, keep me in touch, okay? Yeah, Thank you, Samuel is fucked, that's what's going to happen, Isabel say's they're going on helicopter, they'll find him in no time, Oh my god, no, no,,, Samuel's got it coming at him, Let's go, Sorry, I know you must have heard every kind of insinuation, We men are not very creative, And we get really nervous when we see such a beautiful woman, My name's Samuel, And you? My name's Laura, Hi, Laura, Well, now that we're buddies, can you introduce me to your friend? It's actually her that has got me crazy, Hi, Samuel, I'm Isabel, Isabel, The truth is, I haven't heard something so nice before, I got it from a movie, It sounds really nice, Any news? No, nothing, we were waiting to hear from you, We looked for over two hours, but,,, we found nothing, Who are you calling? My wife, She's also lost, in some spiritual retreat, What do you think? Well, they're telling me the helicopter is ready, -And how many can go? -Just one person, -Well, I'm going, -No, Isabel,,, You help more staying here, for if he shows up elsewhere, -But I'm doing nothing here, -And in the helicopter you'll do less, Listen, he's right, Stay here, Isabel, No! I said I'm going to look for my husband, period, Discussion's over, Marines, walk, What a problem, Baby, calm down! Calm down, They called, -They didn't find anything, -How is that? They're coming back, Isabel must be real bad,,, I've been a fool,,, Don't say that, Isabel, It's true, Since I lost the baby, the only thing I did was push Samuel away, I turned into a tough woman, And now, I don't even know if he's alive, Samuel's alive, I'm sure we'll find him any time now, I hope so, I hope so, And I swear to god, if he shows up, I'll do everything to change, To get him back, start over, I need to be alone, Okay, I'll be at detachment, Hey, look, There's your boat, -It didn't sink, -It seem the anchor got hooked, Let's go over there, I want water, There's no water, What are we going to do? I don't want to wake up without you another day, Isabel, marry me, But if we just met, Yeah, but why wait? I already love your boat, You want to marry me because you like my boat? Well, I like your boat, your house, your vineyard, Your bank account,,, You're crazy, But that's what I like the most about you, Samuel, Yes, my love Yes, I'll marry you, Isabel, Isabel, They just told me they registered flares near Puerto Viejo, we're going out again, -Let's go, -Let's go, Look, over there, look! My love, we're coming for you! -Careful, Isabel, careful, -Yeah, got it, My love, I've got you! No, don't leave me Samuel, please, I don't want to be left alone, no, No, no, No, no, don't leave me!

Grandchildren, -Let's get to it then, -Of course,,, Admit it, Who looks better? Really, baby? Again with this? You, baby, you, Who else? And my baby will look better too, Well,,, They might even look alike, Why do you say that? It comes from the mother's side, Aren't you sisters? Oh, my love, How the time flies, right? Not long ago, we were celebrating right here, Yeah, my love, And in that time, a lot has happened, And in less than a month, even more will happen, Yeah,,, -He started kicking, -He's kicking? -Yeah, yeah, Here, look, -Where is it? -Oh, yeah, I felt that, -Yeah,,, What more to thank than my wife Isabel, You all know not long ago, I lived a traumatizing experience, the day I sailed in my boat, and it caught fire, and I lasted two days stranded in the sea, And the only thing I had was the love I feel for my wife, and wanting to go back to her, I love you, I see you're thinking, What's the matter?
