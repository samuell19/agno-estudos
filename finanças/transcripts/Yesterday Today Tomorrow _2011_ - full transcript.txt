[man] Almost the same as the sky. [woman] How about the fishermen? Are they here? [man] They're in the middle of the sea. [dramatic music playing] [woman] Ariel… [woman] The world is so beautiful. [romantic music playing] [waves rolling] It feels good to live. [romantic, dramatic music continues] [music swells] Do you find that good? Do you want people to get depressed? It's only our initial telecast, but you've already killed the main character? We just based it on the movie, ma'am. And if you remember, we bought the rights to the movie so we could make a soap opera. But don't worry, we've already adjusted the story so it'll appeal to people. Even though the main character dies, her twin sister will replace her. [woman in brown] That's right, ma'am. This cannot be. Reshoot it! But ma'am, it will air in three days. We don't have enough time. Then what are you waiting for? Reshoot it now! That show has a big budget. I won't settle for anything less than number one! -Am I clear?! -Yes, ma'am. Good. Can we make it? You have a meeting with the marketing heads. Cancel it! But they're already waiting for you in the conference room. You can go if you want. Okay. I can probably have it scheduled tomorrow after lunch? I have a ProgCom meeting tomorrow. How hard is your job?! You can't even fix my schedule! [phone rings] Hello? Eunice. What?! Do you need something, my child? Eunice?! My child. What happened? Are you hurt? She got into an accident because of cheerleading. And you. What are you doing here? [background chatter] The school was calling you. You weren't answering. I was in a meeting. I told you to stop doing cheerleading. Look at what's happened to you. Why are you wearing that? That's for the college students. Ma, it's our Foundation Day costume. Let her be. She needs to do some extracurricular activities. Just like that. Am I asking for your opinion? Even if you don't ask for my opinion, I still have the right to give it. Because the last time I checked, she was still my daughter. [phone rings] -Hello, Charlotte? -Garry. Your secretary told me that Eunice had an accident. -She's fine. Here, talk to her. -I'll see you tomorrow. -Mm. -[man] Bye. Your aunt's going to talk to you. -Hi, aunt. -How are you, sweetheart? I'm okay. Nothing to worry. Do you want to go shopping today? Shopping? -When? -Later. Sure! Hello, Charlotte. It's Mariel. Garry already likes you. You don't need to be close to my daughter. -Mariel, I was just -- -[Garry] Mariel. And one more thing. I can go shopping with my daughter, okay? Here. You shouldn't talk to Charlotte that way. Then tell her to stay away from my daughter. Because the last time I checked, I'm still Eunice's mother. Let's go. You seem quiet. Is there a problem? [clears throat] Spill it. I just think I'm too involved with your life. Who am I really to you? I mean, we've been going out for two years. But where is it all going? Well… I've been wanting to tell you this. I don't want you to be my girlfriend anymore. Because I want you to be my wife. Would you like to be my-- Yes! [giggles] [knock at door] Charlotte? -Mm? -I have a lunch meeting today. We might finish late. So, can you be in charge of the wedding invitations? Okay. All right, thank you. See you later. Rick, excuse me. Let's go, Rick. -Garry, wait! -Mm? Speaking of invitations. Yeah? Rick go ahead. I received an email from NBS. We just got invited to pitch campaign ideas for the launch of their new cable channel. NBS? Are you sure? I know Mariel. She would never do that. You never know. She might have changed. Maybe she wants to settle things with you, and this is her way of reaching out to you. Look. If you feel awkward about it. I'll just face her. It would be a waste if we're not going to make an offer. This is a big account for the Limelight Agency if it happens. I wanna thank all of you for coming today. We will be starting in a short while. Oh! MVM is already here. Good morning, ma'am! Why is the Limelight Agency here? Who invited them? Um, I did. Are you really stupid, or do you just have a tiny brain?! I'm sorry, but there seems to be a mistake here. I only approved four ad agencies for the bidding. Four top agencies. As you all know, NBS is the biggest network in the country. And we only deal with the best companies in the industry. You have your car, right? If you don't have one, we can call you a cab. If you don't like us, we are willing to go. You don't need to insult us. Sorry for the drama! This is a TV network after all! I'll see you all later. [indistinct chatter] -[knocking on door] -[man] Ma'am? I told you that I didn't want to be disturbed, right? [older man] Am I a disturbance now? What are you doing here? Can't I visit my own company? I heard about what happened between you and Selene. She already told you. Mariel… Selene is your sister. Just because she's your daughter from another woman doesn't mean I have to accept her as my sister. All I want is for you to train her. She's intelligent, hardworking, and she looks up to you. Don't be harsh on her. Nothing personal. She tries to show off, and yet she's stupid. She invited Garry's agency to the cable channel launch. She didn't even ask for my permission. I was the one who told her to do that. Look. Garry is still the best ad man in the business. Seriously, Dad? After everything he did to me? That was ten years ago. Your marriage has been annulled for a long time. Why still so bitter? You know what, I had this doubt from the very start. But look. You even got embarrassed. What's your ex-wife's problem? Why is she so angry with you? Tell me the truth. Did you do anything wrong? Well, you know the story. Well, I tried to save our marriage. But she didn't look at me like a partner. She always wanted her decisions to be followed. What did she think of me as? An employee! She made me feel so insignificant! Now, can you blame me for falling out of love? Maybe she's still in love with you. [Mariel] 74 in Math?! Mom, most of my classmates failed as well. I don't care about your stupid classmates! What is this, Eunice?! Is this all you can give me? 74 in Math?! Starting from now, you're grounded! Do you understand me?! House and school! And not only that! I will get you a tutor so you can be taught well! Mom, why are you doing this to me?! Why do you want me to be miserable?! Just because you are not happy with your life, don't ruin mine! [gasps] I just want you to be perfect, my daughter. Well, I'm not, Mom! I'm not like you! And I don't ever wanna be like you! Nobody loves you! [sniffling] [tragic music playing] [photographer] One, two, three, smile! [camera clicks] -One more time, move closer. -[indistinct chatter] [photographer] Ready, One, Two, Three! [camera clicks] [dramatic music playing] [indistinct chatter] Okay. One, two, three! [camera clicks] [tragic music playing] [music fades] ♪ In my heart You are the only one I will love ♪ ♪ And forever, you are ♪ ♪ The only one that I will love ♪ ♪ You are my dream, you are my life ♪ ♪ You are the only one ♪ ♪ In my heart ♪ -[applause] -[audience cheers] All right. Gotta go. I have to pick up Jacob at the airport. Wait, are you free next week? Ah, I will try. Okay. I'll go-- Wait, why don't you tell Jacob that you'd like to return to our band? I've tried it already, but he disagreed. Okay, I need to go. -Ouch! You hurry too much! -You're leaving already? [engine purrs] I think we're early. Ma'am, did you go out? Why? I went to the bathroom. Then I saw your car. It wasn't in the garage. I parked it at the back. Why do you ask? Ah. Okay, ma'am. Forget it. Stop thinking about other things. Look at baby Jared. His diaper's wet already. You should've had the driver fetch me instead. You woke up early and you even took Jared with you. [laughs] It's okay. I can't sleep well anyway. And we've missed you. I was only gone for two weeks. But still… Is this Jared? Why has he grown up so fast? Because he really eats a lot! Come on. You can cuddle your son later. [phone rings] Hold on. [phone rings] -Go to your mom. -Okay. Okay. [phone rings] Hello? Hello, Jacob. Hi, sis. Go to the office early. Come by the office later. Mariel, I just arrived. I haven't slept. Can we just meet up tomorrow? I'll see you later. Hello? I have to go to the office later. [sighs] Hey. We have the rights for the first offer. -They shouldn't deal with other networks! -Yeah. I know, sis! I can't understand you. You told me, you don't like her anymore. We have no use for her. She's not as popular as she used to be. Why don't we just let her go?! Just because we have no use for her doesn't mean other networks can! Okay. Sis, Anna has been with us for a long time. She's put a lot of money into this network. If she wants to go, then let her. We will sue her! -Sis. -Call Atty. Marquez. We will sue her! Are we clear? [somber music playing] [car door closes] I know I promised to go out for dinner. I just have to finish my report about our regional branches. You know my sister. She doesn't like waiting. You're always busy. Whenever you don't work overtime, you finish your work here instead. I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. [baby cries] [Jacob] Hon? Hon. Hon! Nanny! Jared's crying! [Jared keeps crying] What's wrong with taking care of our child once in a while? [Jared crying] The reason we have a nanny is to take care of our baby! And for your information! I take care of our child! You just don't see it because you're never around! Where are you going? He already stopped. I'm going to get some acetone. I'm just going to remove my nail polish. [door squeaks] Let's be clear, Jacob! I gave up my dream so we could build a family! I married you to become your wife, to become your child's mother! Not to become a nanny! [woman talking indistinctly] Shiela, can you make some copies for my sister's office and give me back the original? -Yes, sir. -Thank you. Hold on, sir. Hi. Hey. You look upset. I am. A bit. -Why? -I'm doing a brief on the proposed shows. But most of the lines are in Tagalog. I can't understand. -Let me see. I'll help you. -Thanks, bro. Here. Let her do her job! How can she fix her twisted tongue if you help her? And you! If you really want to work at a TV network, you should know the language of the common people! Otherwise, you have no place here! I'm really trying. There are just some words that are difficult to understand. Not all things are easy. There are some things you have to work hard for. Or maybe you wanted to follow in the footsteps of your mom. She only used her beauty. [somber music playing] [engine revs] [sighs] Vic. Why are you here? Hey. We're going to Tagaytay. Remember? Sorry. I forgot. There's too much work in the office. Well, it's still early. If you want, you can sleep in the car. Now what? Are you going to change, or you're going to wear that? Look. Can we take a raincheck? Too tired to go out. [sighs] You always cancel our dates. I'm tired, Vic! You know what? Ever since you got into that company, you've had no time for us. Look. If you're just going to whine and complain, I seriously don't have the energy or patience right now. So just email me. [sighs] I'm still talking to you! [clears throat] [Vic sighs] I'll go ahead. Bye. Looks to me like you and your boyfriend fight a lot these days. To tell you the truth, Mom, he's really beginning to bore me. He's too clingy! But I can handle him. Compared to my problem with Mariel, he's a mere nuisance. Does that witch still give you a hard time? [sighs heavily] Why don't you train somewhere else? Learn from Jacob. I'm sure he won't mind. I really want to learn from the best, though. And unfortunately for me, that's Mariel. [groans] Donald! Hey! Why didn't you ask for help?! You should've called me! I can handle it. [sighs] You know what? You and your daughter are the same! You try to do everything alone, even when you don't have to! Are you hurt? No. Just embarrassed. Lucky for me, you're still patient with me. Even if I'm already crippled. I can't even carry out my obligation as your husband. Donald… I love you. And there's no deficiency that will change that. [sexy music playing] [beeps] Hey. Vince. You gotta go. It's late. I wanna rest. Then let's sleep. I just wanna be alone. Are you serious? Yup. Go. [Vic sighs] [somber music playing] [man] Two… and one. -Okay. Rest first. -[woman] Are you going to do RPM? Ah, I don't think so. I'm not in the right condition. But friend, you're so sexy now! Your PT seems pretty good! How much is your one-hour service? 800 pesos per session, ma'am. So expensive! Is it worth it? Of course! Do you go all the way? Or would you leave me hanging? Betty, please! How old do you think he is? I don't know. He looks like he's in his late 20s or early 30s. Have you been with him for a long time? About one year. Wait! Wait! Last one! Is he single? I think so. I don't know. You know what? Instead of asking me those questions, why don't you hire him as your PT so you can explore his life? You're right! Sorry. Sorry. [door creaks] [woman] You took so long. [somber music playing] I can only stay for an hour. What do you want? All the way, of course. Here's your allowance for this week. I don't need it now. Take it. Do you really have to go now? We have a family dinner. My husband's children are coming. I can't be late. Are you going to the gym tomorrow? Maybe the next day. You got me too tired today. [laughs] I'm leaving now. Wait. Agnes, don't you get tired of hiding? Let's live together. Are you serious? I can't leave my husband for you. What am I to you? Your toy? What of it? And me? Don't tell me you love me! My daughter's almost your age. So what?! Agnes, I love you. No, Derek. No. You just need me because I give you luxury. Agnes, I never asked for any of the things you gave me. I know. But you didn't refuse them. [kisses] [background chatter] [woman] Excuse me. Ma, what are you doing here? I told you I'd be late. My meeting was canceled. So I thought we could go shopping since you were asking me for a bag, right? I can't. I have to do something with my classmates. We have to finish an exhibit for tomorrow. It's okay. If you want, we can have dinner first. Ma, I'm on diet. I have to go. Bye. -Let's go, guys. -Okay. How about this one? Babe, I'm leaving this weekend. My sister and I have a meeting in Hong Kong. -But I'll only be away for two days. -Okay. -[phone rings] -[Jared cries] [hushes] Hello? Yeah. Wait. Wait. Hello, attorney. Yeah. Nanny, take him. [Jared crying] Hello, Portia. Looks like I can go to the gig next week. Come in! You didn't eat dinner. I'm not hungry. I'll be gone for a couple of days. Your Uncle Jacob and I have a seminar. So I thought maybe you could stay with Grandpa? Or, if you want, with your dad? Really, Mom? I can stay with Papa?! Mm-hmm. -But just this once, okay? -Ma, thank you! It's been a long time since you visited the condo. I'm busy. When will you be free? I miss you. [background gym music] Ma! Hi, Mom! I thought you went to the Alabang branch? Ah. I prefer it here. Miss A, is she your daughter? -Yes. -Wow. You look like sisters! They say that all the time! I don't know if she looks young for her age or if I look old already! You don't look old! Because I have a hot mom! [giggles] Hi. Ah, Selene, this is my personal trainer, Derek. Derek, my daughter Selene. -Good afternoon. -Nice to meet you. [background gym music] -Ma'am, Eunice is coming out. -I'll do it, Nanny. Where's Garry? He had an emergency meeting with a client. [Eunice] Hey! -Aunt Charlotte! -Hey! You have your swimsuit with you? Swimsuit?! Didn't Garry tell you? We're planning to bring Eunice to Boracay. We didn't talk about it. Ma… You text and call me all the time. Do you hear me? Yes, Ma! Thank you! Ah, wait! My iPod! I let Eunice go with you because I know that's what she wants. I just want to make her happy. But the moment I find out you mistreat her, you will pay. Do you understand? [laughs] I think you produce too many soap operas, Mariel. I'm not the evil stepmother. You have nothing to worry about. Eunice and I get along very well and I intend to take good care of her. I mean, I am the wife of her father. Practically her second mother. You can never be her mother. You're not good enough. Mm. You have a 9:30 p.m. flight, right? -Aren't you going to be late? -No. No. We're already checked in. I just have to meet my sister in the office. We're signing checks for the budget. Do I have to take you to the airport? You don't have to. You can go home. -Okay. -So you can be with our son, okay? Okay. [background street noise] Thank you. -Bye! Take care! -Bye. Thank you. Hi. Good evening. Bye! [phone rings] Hello? [girl] Where are you?! We're waiting for you here at the bar. I have to go home first. I took Jacob to the office. I have to leave the car or the maids might suspect that I'm out. [engine revs] -Good evening, nanny. -Good evening, sir! -I'll take care of that. -Where's the madam? -In the kitchen. -Kitchen? Okay. Honey! My baby's here! Wow! What's that?! Popcorn! Is that our dinner? This is for me and Eunice. We're having a DVD marathon. Wow! -Where's Eunice? -She's taking a bath. [Derek] Is your husband looking for you? [Agnes] I told him I'm playing mahjong. Here. What is this for? Should there be a reason? [melancholic music playing] Another watch? I have many of these. You're welcome. Have you talked to your daughter? Doesn't she notice anything? ♪ In my heart You're the only one I love ♪ [phone rings] Yes, Ma? [Mariel] How are you? Is your dad there? We're on our way to the airport. Have you eaten dinner? [building rumbling] [foreboding music playing] ♪ …no one else ♪ -Garry, an earthquake! -Eunice! -[wiring zapping] -Oh my god! [glasses shattering] [screams] [crashing] Eunice! Let's go underneath! [screams and groans] [dramatic music playing] Hurry! Let's go! Daddy! Daddy! [groans] [car skidding] [glass shatters] [dramatic music fades] Eunice?! -Eunice! -Garry, it's dangerous! I have to go to Eunice! Stay here! Garry! -Garry! -Stay there! Eunice! Eunice! Help me! Eunice! -[man 1] Look there! -[man 2] Hurry! Let's help! [woman] Hurry! [Agnes] Derek, help me! Help me! Derek! My feet! I can't move my feet! Derek, don't leave me! Derek! Derek! Help! Eunice! Eunice! My daughter! My daughter! [Agnes sobbing] [Derek] Slowly. [grunts in pain] Take the taxi. [crowd talking indistinctly] An earthquake occurred in Metro Manila earlier with a magnitude of 7.8. Based on the initial reports, as well as the damaged properties, it also caused widespread fires, and there's fear that many people were trapped inside collapsed buildings. Were you able to contact them? No one's answering. Try calling the landline. Mariel! Okay, according to the news report from the News Department, there are buildings that have collapsed, there are damaged streets, and some places have no electricity. So, the earthquake caused a lot of damage. Jacob, I haven't heard from Eunice! Something bad might've happened to her! It'll be okay. Don't think like that. Have you heard from your wife? [background chatter] [wailing and sobbing] [woman] My child! [people clamoring] [siren wailing] Mila! Mila! Mila! Mila! -[Emy sobbing] -Emy? Emy! Where's Mila?! -Emy! Where's Jared?! -[keeps sobbing] Mila! Mila! My child? My god! My child? [dramatic music playing] My god! My child?! Jared! No! [sobbing] [anguished sob] Jared! No… No! No! [anguished sobbing] She's very lucky she only got a fracture. Her leg should be in a cast. Can I see her, Doc? Just go to the recovery room. -[nurse] Doc! -[doctor] Go. -Yes, nurse? -You're needed here! Okay. [patients shouting and wailing] Do you need anything? I'll stay with you. [sighs] Go home. I have to call my family. [sad music playing] -[siren wailing] -[people talking indistinctly] There! Help! [Jacob panting] Lori. Lori? [downbeat music continues playing] [Lori sobbing] [tragic violin music playing] [anguished yells] [sobbing] Lori. Lori. [both sobbing brokenly] [Jacob] Jared… Garry! Where's my daughter Eunice?! Mariel. Mariel! [machine beeping] [Mariel whimpers softly] [whimpers] -You promised me! -Hey! Mariel! You promised me! I trusted you with my child! You told me you were going to take care of her! You said you're going to take care of her, but look at what you did! -What did you do?! -Mariel, it's not Charlotte's fault! I didn't want that to happen! Whether you wanted that to happen or not, you had my child in your house! You had a responsibility! You promised me! I should never have let my daughter go! You didn't take care of her! You didn't take care of my daughter! You didn't take care of her! [sobbing] Eunice! Eunice! [man] Jacob! -Jacob, I'm sorry. -Thanks. What happened? How did that happen to Jared? He was with you, right? Dad… Dad, I was at the network. He was in the nursery. Where were you? I was downstairs preparing his milk. I was about to go to him when the earthquake occurred. I almost got hit by the refrigerator. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Call your sister, Mariel. Let her know what happened. And your mom, try to call her again. "Move on." We always say that to other people. Nearly all problems are connected with these two words. [sniffs] But if someone died, how do you move on? I believe that… I believe there are reasons why things happen. I just don't understand right now. [mournful music playing] And… all I can do is cope and move on. [suppressed sobbing] [Charlotte] Why can't I visit Eunice? Be patient with Mariel. Try to understand her situation. [Charlotte sighs] What else am I doing? By the way, I won't go to the office tomorrow. I'll stay with Mariel at the hospital. What about the accounts you handle? I asked Ramon to take care of it. Ramon can't handle that. But you're here. You can help him. Garry, I can't handle the ad agency alone. We have no choice. I can't abandon my family. Am I not your family? Charlotte… I have no energy to fight with you. Don't give double meanings to what I tell you. Where do you want to eat? Let's just go home. Oh, come on. When we're in the house, you always ask to go out. Now we're out, and yet you want to go home. Don't you worry. You'll be able to walk after just a few months. Don't you want that? And at least we look good together now. I love you. I love you too. [unsettling music playing] [shower running] [women talking indistinctly] Hey. Derek, right? -How are you? -I'm good. How's Ma'am Agnes? She hasn't gone to the gym for quite a time. She fractured her leg. Ah. Looks like it'll take a long time before she comes back. Maybe a few months. Hey, listen. I'm planning on getting a personal trainer. Can you recommend anyone? A personal trainer… PJ's good. Harold's good too. And what about you? Um… -[worker] It'll finish soon. -[Jacob] Thank you. -[Jacob] For working overtime. -[worker] That's fine, sir. Sir, there are still some things we need to finish here and upstairs. -[Lori] Here. -Thank you, ma'am. -Honey, you want one? -I'm good. Thank you. -Okay. -[phone ringing] -[woman] Want a sandwich? -No thanks. Okay, sir. [Jacob] Where are you going to put the scaffolding? -[Lori] Hello, Portia. -[worker replies indistinctly] [Jacob] Okay. I'll park the car outside. -[worker] Okay, sir. -[woman] Have a snack first. -Thank you, Ben. -[Lori] You can recruit someone else. I'm done with singing. [hammering sound] Portia, I'm a bit busy right now. The house is under renovation. I'll call you later. Portia? Yup. She just said hello. Babe. Why don't you go back to singing in a band? So you won't be left here alone. I'd rather stay here and be with you. Yeah, but we both know I'm going to be busy in the office. Especially now. Mariel's on leave. [sighs] Go. Call Portia. Tell her you'll go back to singing. Are you sure? ♪ If this is just a bad dream ♪ ♪ I hope you wake me up ♪ ♪ And when I wake up ♪ ♪ Embrace me ♪ ♪ And tell me you love me too ♪ [machine beeping] [Garry] Mariel! Surprise! I brought a banana fritter for you! This is your favorite, right? You still remember? Of course! I courted you for a long time. You became my girlfriend. You became my wife. Of course, I also know the things you don't like and those you do. Am I right? Come. Let's eat while it's still hot. How did your love for me fade? If we'd still been together, this would not have happened to Eunice, right? Mariel… Garry… I'm sorry. Sorry if I became too much of a nagger. Let's not go back to those things. But you know what? Even if we always fought back then, I didn't think you'd leave me. I thought that whatever happened, you would still love me. Because that's what we promised, right? "For better, for worse." I still love you so much. Garry. I got so bitter because of what happened to us. All the people around me, even our child, I made them suffer. That's why I thought, maybe the earthquake isn't to blame for what happened to Eunice. It could be me. [machine beeping] [Donald] My daughter Mariel is going through a lot at the moment. She needs your support and prayers. But I have requested my son, Jacob, to step up to the plate while Mariel is out. And so without further ado, I would like to present to all of you, our new president, Jacob Montes. -[man] Congratulations. -[Jacob] Thank you. [applause] Ma'am, the lights and sounds are outside. They're asking for the payment. My god. Give it to me. [employees chatting indistinctly] Thank you, ma'am. [woman] Thank you so much. [Charlotte] It's good you're here. I've been trying to call you. Yeah. My cellphone's low on battery. So I left it in the car. I don't have a charger. Fine. Hurry. The clients are in the conference room. -[woman] Excuse me, sir. -[Garry] Yes? It's Ms. Montes. Excuse me. Thank you. Hello? [Mariel] It's Eunice… [Mariel sobbing] What happened?! She's flatlined. The doctors are here. They're reviving her. Can you come back? I'm coming back. Thank you, Garry. -[doctor] Time of death. -10:20. Mariel… -Mariel! -[Mariel] Why did you stop?! There's nothing we could do. Eunice is gone. No! She can't! Doc! No! Do everything! You don't know what you're talking about! -Do everything you can! -Eunice is gone. No! God! [anguished sobbing] My child! My child! Sweetheart! My child! I can't handle this! Mama can't handle this! I can't handle this! I can't handle this, my child! No! I can't handle this. [sobbing] I can't handle this! My god! I can't handle this. [indistinct chatter] -Nurse, what happened? -I'm sorry, sir. [doctor] I'm really, really sorry, but we have to let her go. [Mariel] Garry… Our child… [tragic music playing] My child… [Mariel sobbing] [sobbing] -Hey. -Go! Ma'am! Is the guy wearing the dark grey polo still there? Who is that anyway? He's my boyfriend, aka The Stalker. Let's go. Please just drive. [phone rings] Okay. Go. Go. Go. Go. -Come on. Just go! -What?! Ma'am, we still have a session! Please. I really need to go. [phone keeps ringing] [indistinct background chatter] By the way, why are you hiding from your boyfriend? I don't want to be with him anymore. Don't you love him anymore? [scoffs] Why don't you break up with him? I don't have the heart to tell him I don't love him anymore. And I don't like drama. That's bad for you. It's still early morning and you're already drinking. Come on! Live a little. Life is too short. In fact, tomorrow is the burial of my niece. And she didn't even drink. Cheers? [rain pattering] Have you seen Jun, her godfather? They went to the cemetery. Babe, change your clothes so you can rest. I'll call you when dinner's ready. I'm not hungry. You're going out? Where are you going? I'll be back in a bit. But where are you going?! You can rest now, Manang. Are you sure, ma'am? [thunder rumbling] [sad music playing] [doorbell rings] [dramatic music playing] What the?! What are you doing here?! Why are you out in the rain? You might get sick. It's my fault, Mariel. I gave up too easily. I didn't even try to fight to fix our problems. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [dramatic music continues] [music fades] You're awake. This is wrong. What? Why? Go back to your wife. She might be waiting for you. I don't want her to have to go through what I went through with you before. [sighs] Ma'am, let's start. Hey, what's "kalaguyo"? "Kalaguyo…" A lover. [background gym music] For example, if you're in a relationship with someone who has a wife or a husband, then you're the kalaguyo. What are you reading anyway? A teleplay. Some of the words are so hard to understand. When's your break? Later after our session. Good. Let's find out if you're as good as a Filipino tutor as you are a personal trainer. [background gym music] The girl likes the guy too, that's why she's playing pakipot. What's "pakipot"? Pakipot. The reason why the girl gives the guy a hard time is so that she has proof that the guy likes her. Playing hard to get! She's so finicky! Most Filipino women are like that. Pakipot. -Really?! -Yes! I grew up in the states. That's why maybe I'm not like that. But now, I'm wishing I'd stayed here and studied. Then I wouldn't be having such a hard time understanding the script! Don't worry. If you need help, just come to me. Thanks. I might just take you up on that offer. Selene! Vic? I've been calling and texting you! -What's going on?! -Look. Don't make a scene here, okay? I'll give you a call. Are you avoiding me?! -Is it because of him?! -He's just a friend! Hey! Are you hitting on my girlfriend?! Dude… -Don't call me dude! -Stop it! -What the?! -Then don't push me! [Selene] Stop! Guys! [woman] Call security! [Selene] Stop it! [grunts] Stop it! I don't ever want to see you again! Let's go! I'll do it. I'll do it. You must have somewhere to go. You have work, right? I can stay. No. I'm fine. Aren't you attracted to me? Or you're just playing pakipot? Don't you get it? I really like you, Derek. That's why I've been trying to get your attention since day one. And the more I get to know you, the more I fall for you. [soft, dramatic music playing] [dramatic music builds] [music slowly fades] Hey, guys! -Have a break! Come on let's eat! -[Lori] Hi! Lori, you have the most super husband on Earth! You should be our manager! Oh my! He's so busy. He's just squeezing me into his schedule. [bandmates] Aww. -Oh my. -[Jacob] Go! Let's go eat! [woman] Babe! Babe! [man, cooing] Hello! -[woman 1] Hi, baby! -[woman 2] Your godchild! You also have a visitor! You didn't even tell me it was family day! No, we're just passing by. Bugoy and I are going to the mall. [baby cries] [distant roadway noise] You've been quiet. I remembered Jared. I should've given him more of my time. [somber music playing] [Jacob sighs] You were right about what you said about me. I put my work first. You know what I do? I squeeze you into my schedule. I abandoned you. I should have put you first. [sighs] Lori… I still have a chance, right? I mean… I still have time to make it up to you, right? Yes. You know? I want… I want things to change between us. -Sir Jacob? -Yes? Sir Mike's here. -Hey, Mike! -Jacob, can I bother you for a while? Yeah! Sit. We're making a documentary about the earthquake devastation. We've already gathered materials from eyewitnesses, accounts, including homemade videos. And one of the videos we've gathered was recorded from a cellphone. He was able to record the chaos that happened at the bar where Lori sings that night. Did you say Lori? My wife? Well, actually, that's why I'm here, Jacob. I want to confirm if this truly is Lori on the video. And maybe if we can have an interview with her for our documentary. ♪ …just you alone ♪ [building rumbling] [people screaming in video] [dramatic music playing] [soft music playing] I have to go to work early tomorrow. [yawns] Please turn off the bathroom lights. Goodnight. Mariel, is Jacob there? He still hasn't come home. Ah, wait. I think he's here now. Bye. [Jacob sighs] Jacob, what are you doing here? Where have you been? Have you been here for a while now? What about you? Where have you been? I've been home the whole day. Are you telling the truth? Maybe you were out. Maybe you went out. Jacob, what are you talking about? Come on. Let's go inside. I think you drank a lot. Yes. [sniffs] I got drunk. So what? I miss our baby. Do you miss our baby? -Yes, Jacob. -Of course. Of course, you miss Jared. Of course. Of course. Of course, you know that he should've… he should've been alive. Jared is dead. And it's because of you! [chuckles] Jared died because of you! [whimpers] What? You can't talk?! Go! Go. Go. Defend yourself! Go! -Jacob… -What?! You're going to lie again?! Come on! Tell me you were inside our house when the earthquake happened! Tell me you were here when our son died! Go! Lie to me! Tell me you weren't at the bar singing like a hooker! Go! I'm sorry. Sorry? Sorry?! Not as sorry as I am for believing you. Jacob. Please! Let's talk, Jacob! Please! Please, let's talk! Jacob! Jacob, please! Let's talk! Jacob! [sobs] [woman] We're thinking that the setup would be like this. There'd be monitors on this side and on this side, and there will be a big LED screen. Sorry. Excuse me. -Shiela. -[over intercom] Yes, sir? What is it? Hi. Yeah. Where's my coffee? Oh, okay, sir. I'll bring it there. Okay. Thank you. Continue, please. -Why don't we all take a break? -You guys want-- I'm sure you're waiting to have a cigarette break. -Okay. Excuse me, sir. -Okay! Excuse me, sir! Jacob, are you okay? You look fuzzy. Yeah. Sorry. I stayed up late. Why don't we reset this meeting tomorrow so you can go home and rest? Do you drink? What? [Jacob, slurring] Okay! Let's have a toast! [pop music playing over radio] To love! -Success. -Success. To happiness! Prosperity! To secrets! -Secrets. -Secrets… -Cheers! -Cheers! All right. Where's Garry? He's in Subic. There's a product launch. Hey! Call him! Call him! He's about to finish! Call him! He doesn't drink anymore. I think he's aging. [laughs] Call him! Why are you here? I just arrived from Subic. I brought you this. A present. [engine purrs] Jacob. Jacob, wake up. Is this sir Jacob's house? It's so big! It looks like a municipal's office. That's Mariel's house. I don't know where he lives. Hey, wait a minute. That's Garry's car, right? What's the reason why you're here? I think about you a lot. Are you out of your mind? You're married. -Are you really looking for trouble? -No. I need you. Even if you don't tell me, I know you need me too. -What about your wife? -I'll leave her. You told me you loved me too. [doorbell rings] -Good evening, ma'am. -Manang, who is it? I got it, bro. Thank you. Charlotte. We're just dropping Jacob off. He's drunk. -I don't know where his house is. -Just take him inside. -Hi, sis. -Go with them. Jacob, fix yourself. It's embarrassing. I'll just wait for my friend at the car. By the way… if you're done with my husband, please tell him to go home right away. After all, it's already late, and this is not his house. Charlotte… We're just talking about something. Of course. What else would you do other than talking? But shouldn't I be included in that talk? No need. We're done. There's nothing to talk about. Hey, what time do you get off? [indistinct customer chatter] Nine o'clock. So maybe we can have a late dinner or something? Okay? I'll see you later. Why did you do that? There are so many people who can see us. So what? Why? Scared that they're going to think I'm your girl? It's not that. I'm just happy that you're not ashamed of me. [woman 1] I love it! [woman 2] When will you be able to walk properly? Actually, I can. [clinking sound] I just get tired easily, so I take it one step at a time. So you're going to take a while before getting back to the gym? Maybe next month. I miss going to the gym. Oh my! That's why I always see your daughter there! -It's good that it's fine with you! -That what? That your former PT is now your daughter's boyfriend! Derek! [somber music playing] [door squeaks] [Agnes] Selene! Hi, Mom! Is it true that Derek's your boyfriend?! We hang out. We date. Why didn't you tell me right away?! No reason. We're still in the Getting-To-Know-Each-Other phase. And it's not like we're planning to get married or anything. Break up with him! Whatever relationship you have, stop it! Why? Because he's not good enough for you! I like Vincent more! Are you trying to dictate my life?! I'm not a kid anymore! And besides, what's your beef with Derek?! What? Because he's a gym instructor?! Is that it?! -No! -Then what?! Because you don't know him. You don't know what he's after? [Donald] What is that?! It's already late, and yet you, mother and daughter, are still yelling at each other. What's the problem?! It's your wife! She's the one with the big problem! Hey! Hey! That's your mother you're talking about! What are you fighting about? She never used to care who my boyfriends were! She never meddled! That's why I don't understand why she's so against our relationship! But I understand her. She's against our relationship because… Because… We're not good for each other. No! Don't belittle yourself. Look… I'm sorry if I made you feel bad. Maybe I shouldn't have told you about my mom's reaction. It's just that I want to be honest. If she doesn't like you, then who cares? You are my boyfriend, not hers. [knocking on door] -Talk to your wife. -Mariel. Hello, Lori? Jacob's asleep. I'll just tell him you called. It's not that I'm sending you away, but until when are you going to keep doing that to your wife? Sis… How long did your annulment with Garry take to be granted? Why? Are you two really going to separate? Are all men really like that? You get tired easily? You easily give up? Jacob, both you and I lost a child because of this tragedy. But we don't both have to lose a family. You can start all over again. Unlike me… Do you really want to be like me? [Derek grunts] You bastard! You're so shameless! You're even fooling around with my daughter! -You're using her! -That's not true! I love Selene! I didn't plan it! It just happened! Don't try to fool me, Derek! I know what a rotten soul you have! That's the problem, Agnes. You look down on me! While Selene is sincere! She makes me feel that we're equal! Unlike you, who treats me like a toy even now! Whether a toy or a fuck buddy, I pay for your every move so you don't have the right to complain! Now, you have one week to get another place. And you can't bring anything from this condo! I gave you all of this, and now I want it back! This is all mine! Even this thing that you're eating! Then take it all! But I'm begging you, let me and Selene be. I love your daughter. And I have good intentions towards her. Bullshit! Derek, bullshit! If I have to, I'll tell her the truth! Just to protect my daughter! I will do it! Mom? Why are you here? You have to know something. Your mom came here to ask if what she heard about me was true. About my past. Because before I became a gym instructor, I was a macho dancer in a gay bar. No. -I was a call boy then. -[Selene] No. [cries] [somber music playing] Hi, Selene. Overtime? Hey. -Jacob… -What's wrong? What do you do when you find out that the person you love the most has been keeping secrets from you? What kind of a secret? It's about my boyfriend. His past… I don't know how to deal with it. I still love him, but he lied! It's up to you. Weigh things over. What's more important to you? Is it what he did or… your love for him. I think you need to get back to work, Mariel. To tell you the truth, Jacob is finding it hard doing your job. Jacob and Lori have a problem. Precisely. That's why you have to go back to the network. You know, I'm thinking of making your comeback a big industry event. We're doing it with the launch of our cable channel. -You can go. Leave us. -Yes, sir. It would be great timing. All our partners will be there. That will really send a message across to our competitors. Are you all right? I just got dizzy. [indistinct chatter] [Garry sighs] Are you sure? Garry, that's exactly what I asked the doctor. But he said it's normal for my condition. Condition? I didn't want to believe it. That's why I took the test a couple of times. What are we going to do? I'm still the father of the child. The child isn't a problem. I can take care of the child alone. You're a married man. What have we done, Garry? What's your plan? You're going to make me a mistress! After you left me for another woman! Is this what I deserve? -[applause] -[dynamic music playing] [MC] With a strong focus on innovative content and quality programming, NBS is set to change the way we see cable television, and the entertainment industry dramatically. [applause] And so now, without further ado, the man behind it all, Mr. Donald Montes! [applause] Thank you, Tim. Good evening! Thank you! Thank you all for joining us on this special evening. Giving speeches isn't my thing. So, I'll just introduce the person who is the true brain of NBS. My eldest child, Mariel Montes! [applause] You all know that I was missing for a couple of months. I took a vacation. I mourned. The earthquake changed my life. I lost a big part of me. I lost the love of my life. But I know she would want me to continue living. That's why I'm here. I'm back and ready to start anew! [applause] [party music playing indistinctly] Jacob. Can we talk? [indistinct party chatter] Jacob! Jacob! Jacob, let's talk, please! Jacob! -Jacob! -What?! Jacob, what do I have to do for you to forgive me? I don't know! I don't know! I don't even know what to do myself! Do you think I don't want to forgive you?! I really want to forgive you! The problem is I can take it out of my mind that you went out! That you left our son! I can't take it out of my mind that you're the reason why Jared died! Jacob, I didn't want that to happen. I loved our son so much! His death was painful to me! So, please, come back to me! Lori, if I come back to you, our life will only be like hell. I don't care. I'll endure it all! It's over! How's your mom? Just got a text from her. She said she's not feeling well. She's not coming over. Dad, is it okay if I leave now? Okay. You take care. Thanks, Dad. [downbeat music playing] Excuse me. Mariel. Garry, I'm busy. -Mariel, just a minute. Please. -Whatever you want to say, can you please… I need you in my life. [gags] What is it? [vomits] [somber music playing] [soft, downbeat music playing] [clears throat] I'm already packed. I was planning to leave tomorrow, but I can go tonight. Besides, my things are already packed. And… I'm not going to bring these things you gave me. This is not what I came here for. I'm here to thank you. You let yourself be ruined in Selene's eyes. But you didn't drag me with you. You still kept my secret hidden. There's no point in her finding out about our secret. The relationship between you and your daughter would just get ruined. She would have a difficult time. You really love my daughter. I'm sorry, Derek. I also love my daughter. And I only want what's best for her. And that's not you. Again, thank you for everything. [door opens] Oh my god. Selene, listen to me! That thing about me and Derek, that's nothing! I already ended it a long time ago! Don't touch me! Liar! How could you do this to me?! How could you do this to my dad?! Please, Selene. Don't tell your dad. You even want me to lie to my father?! What kind of a wife and mother are you?! I will tell him about this. Just give me a little time. I hate you! Selene! [engine revs] Charlotte! Please! What's really happening between you and Mariel?! I'm not blind, Garry! That's enough! Let's not talk about this! I'm tired! All I get from you is nagging! Because you're making me look stupid! I can see you've been acting differently these past few days! You're always quiet! You think a lot! Charlotte… I lost a child, right? It's normal that I'm absent-minded. Until when are you going to use that excuse! "We lost our child. Mariel needs me. I'll just go to her." Damn that Mariel! Shut up! You don't have the right to talk to her like that! Why not?! Who is she in your life?! Garry, I am now your wife! I love her too. And I have a big responsibility towards our child. What?! Mariel is pregnant. I don't want to go home zero tonight! -My hair would be wasted! -Mine too! -I even made an effort! -I even went to the salon! Thank you. -Look at him! -Where?! He's so handsome! Look at him! Do you see what I see? [club music playing] You look thirsty. You look drunk. My place is just near. [club music continues playing] What is this for? To settle our bill. This is too much. Keep the change. [club music continues playing] Wait! Where are you going?! Hey! Wait! I knew it! It's the egotistical trainer. Dude, I don't want trouble. You should've said that when you tried to steal my girlfriend! I'm not going to fight with you. So I'm begging you to let me go home. He's a coward! Now what?! Let's go, Vincent! You just showed off in front of Selene! Now you're alone, suddenly you have no balls? You're a worthless man! Gays are better than you! [grunts] Who's gay?! Huh?! [grunts] Get up! Now what?! Can you still handle it?! Where's Lori? She hasn't been able to rehearse our new number. You know she's going through a lot, right? Lori? He doesn't want me anymore. Lori… He wants a separation. If he doesn't want you anymore, then let him be. Lori, that's enough. Here. Take one. It'll make you calm. [cries] That's enough. -That's enough. Look at yourself. -[man talking indistinctly] Coreen, the manager wants to talk to us. -What happened to her? -Don't meddle here! You're irritating! That's enough, okay? When you're done with that, go straight to the dressing room. Then dress up. Prepare yourself. Fix yourself. Let's go. Let's go. [dark music playing] [soft, sad music playing] ♪ If you won't be in my life ♪ ♪ My heart can't take it ♪ ♪ All of my dreams ♪ ♪ Will fade ♪ ♪ It will be nonsense ♪ ♪ Living in this world ♪ ♪ If this is only a bad dream ♪ ♪ I hope you wake me up ♪ ♪ And when I wake up, embrace me ♪ ♪ And tell me you love me too ♪ ♪ If you will be gone ♪ ♪ I won't be able to ♪ ♪ Face tomorrow alone ♪ ♪ If you're going to leave me ♪ ♪ What will happen-- ♪ -Lori! -Lori! Lori! -[woman groans] -[Jacob] Lori! [Jacob] Lori! -[woman] Lori! -[Jacob] Lori! Lori! Lori! [Donald] Selene! What's this? What's happening? Dad, it's time for me to live on my own. Why? We have a big house. I just can't live here anymore. Don't worry. I'll still come and visit, Dad. Okay? -I love you, Dad. -I love you. Selene! Selene. [Selene scoffs] Agnes. What was that? What happened? Donald… What? Donald… I love you. So? What's the connection? What? I have wronged you. What are you saying? [somber music playing] Garry told me everything. Charlotte, I don't have the time to fight with you now. I'm here to beg you. Mariel, I won't be able to make it if I lose Garry. Avoid him. I'm begging you. I am his wife now. I have the right. So, please… I'm begging you. Don't steal my husband. [somber music playing] [somber music continues playing] Hi. Are you still mad at me? And you? Are you mad at me? You are innocent. I am the one who did something wrong. [roadway noise] Good morning, ma'am. V-power? -Yes, please fill it up. -Okay, zero, zero. Ma'am, do you want me to wash this? Okay, thank you. I'm sorry that I blamed you for the death of our son. I know I've been a bad husband. I'm really sorry. I won't be able to forgive myself if something bad happens to you. I love you. [emotional music playing] [emotional music intensifies] [softly sobbing] [Eunice] I'm so happy. Finally, Mom let me have a sleepover at Dad's house. I know it's not easy for her. But she wants me to be happy. And she loves me. That's why she's letting me go. I hope I'm right. And I hope Mommy's also learning to let go of the past. I know she had a lot of misunderstandings with Daddy. They had a lot of fights. But that's already ended. I NEED TO GO FOR EVERYONE'S PEACE. GOODBYE, GARRY. [Eunice] There are things that cannot be fixed. They should only be accepted. What's important is we have today to correct our mistakes. We can all still make up for them. But of course, we shouldn't expect that everything will go back to what it was before. It will never be the same. Never. But at least we can hope, just hope, that tomorrow will be better. [somber music playing] [music ends]
