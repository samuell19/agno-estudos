Punch. Punch. Punch. Punch. Punch. Punch. Punch. Punch. Punch. - Let's go, right now. - Yeah? - Right here, let's go. - You want that? - Right here. - Hey. - Let's do it right now. - Hey, hey. I'm tired of this. Calderon, on the line. Come on, get up, Frank. Who's next, huh? Let's go, I can take any one of you on. Tell 'em, Dad. I could beat every one of these kids in here. You tell 'em, come on. I'd beat 'em... Why do you always have to do that to me, Dad? It's not fair. Life may not always be what you want it to be. Sometimes you gotta dig deep. Deeper than you ever did before. You reach inside and you let it go. Get up. Yeah I mean, ever since your mother died, it's just been... Dad, you don't even. You don't have to go there. Whenever you're down, you're always welcome here. Seriously, Dad, anytime. We love when you're here and so do the boys. Thank you. Uncle Steve, Uncle Steve, come check this out. - Sound familiar? - Good kid. What, who, me? Yeah, always trying to get my attention to play with you and your friends. Those were good times, Steve. Yeah, Joey, they were. Definitely. Now they didn't have to change until you decided to just take off. I'll be right back. Dad, why do you have to keep digging at him? 'Cause he's too reckless. What is he gonna do one day when his luck runs out, huh? What's gonna happen then? You can't change who someone is, Dad. Forget it. So what's up with work? Well, those two guys I told you about who were murdered looked like they had been through a war zone. Had lacerations, contusions on their bodies and facies. Knife wounds? No. More like full contact fighting without gloves. What does the brass say? What else, Dad, they want it done quickly and quietly. What is else is new, God. Doesn't sound good. Who's running tactical? Uncle Frank, I hope. Of course he is. Who do you think put me in touch with the A-team? I still don't like it. Why don't they get someone else to run undercover? Joey, you got a family. Dad, look, anyone else would blow their cover at the first sign of a problem. They chose me because of my experience. All right. You just keep me in the loop. Promise? Promise, Dad. All right, we got a snitch who's been feeding us intel. You're gonna make your way into this organization and establish yourself as a fighter who's down on his luck, looking to fight, make some money and looking to pay off gambling debts. They need to think they own you. Maybe I should just bet on myself. Concentrate, smart ass. This is serious business. Don't screw this up. I know, I know. Look, you guys chose me. We're gonna get these bastards. Thank you. - Hey. - Shit. What you nervous about something? Don't do that to me. Do what? Do what, Arny? Nothing. Look, maybe you guys could be a little nicer to me, since I'm doing this for you. Oh you think we owe you something? From my recollection, you're the one who got busted with those drugs. That's why you're here ratting on your friends. Okay, goddammit. You used to be a lot nicer. I think this undercover thing is going to your head. All right, that's enough. Where's Vincent? Well, we have to drive to him and I don't have a car. I got a fuckin' car. Let's go. Let's go. Take me there. Hope it's not a cop car. So why don't we bring the guys here tomorrow around four o'clock? Yeah, it's open. Hey, Vinnie. Hey, look who it is. Here I am. Who's he? - This is... - I'm Johnny... Yeah, I wasn't talking to you. Arny? This is Johnny Siglioni, he's the fighter I told you about. Arny says you can fight. Yeah, that's right. What's your story? You know, like anybody. Just fell on a little debt. Need to get back on my feet, you know what I'm sayin'? Sure. You don't look too special. So maybe I put you out there, you show me what you got, yeah? Yeah, won't let you down. - All right. - Okay, thanks, man. - All right. - Appreciate it. - You got it. - Thanks, Vinnie. Yeah. Now next month. Woo hoo, Johnny boy. 'Atta boy. Did you see that? I told you he was pretty good. Relax, relax. Play that funky music, white boy. Put your money on Johnny. Put your money on Johnny, everybody. - White tiger, white tiger! - Arny! He's the king. I want finders. Come on! Hey, watch out for that one. What, who? Vincent's lapdog. He doesn't trust you. Do I know you? Just some friendly advice. We ain't friends. Hey. Jesus Christ, Steve, you wanna get shot? You gonna shoot me, little brother? They're sleeping. Sorry about that, but hey uh, what the hell is goin' on here? Dressed like this, smoking. Come on. It's just undercover work, all right? Are you crazy? Fighters are turning up dead. It's all part of the syndicate. Not the Rouha Syndicate? Look, gambling was one thing. Now it's murder. You can't do this. These guys are no joke. Look, I got dad breathing down my neck. I don't need you doin' it too, all right? Hey, I've had dad breathing down my neck my whole life. I get it. But come on, even after mom died. You know he was no piece of cake. But Joey, I can't. I can't let you do this. Look, we got it covered okay? It's good, it's good. You wanna come in? Hey, Vincent, you wanted to talk? Johnny. New kid on the block. Yeah, that's me. Hey listen, if you don't mind I just wanted to warm up. So if we could make this quick? Yeah, I won't hold you up, you know. Hey, last few fights, pretty good. Appreciate that. This one, you're going down in the second. I'm not losing to no one. I'm not asking. You fuck me on this, you're done. You got it? - Yeah. - Say it. I'm going down in the second. Make it look real. Yeah. Hey. Now you can go. We got a problem. What's up? Your man right there, he's a cop. Johnny? I'm gonna make a fortune with this kid. I'm telling you. That junkie Arny may have set you up. - You sure? - I'm sure that guy's a cop. My guy is dispatch filled me in. As for Arny, I'll find out. I'll take care of it, all right? Don't worry. Johnny, come here, kid. Hey, hey, you were great. Unbelievable. Don't worry about any of this, all right? There's plenty more where that came from. I want you to get cleaned up, all right? Come downstairs and I wanna talk about your future. Yeah. - All right? - All right, sure. It's your future. What have you got in mind? You'll see, come on. Get him over there. - You're fuckin' piece of... - Come on. - Piece of shit. - Use your fuckin' feet. Come on. Grips, put him over there. Push him down. This is what happens when you fuck me. Come on. Hey, what are you doing here so early? We need to talk. Yeah. What is it? I know you 30 years, what's on your mind? What is it, I can handle it. Has my son Steve gotten himself into trouble again? Not Steve. It's Joey. We found him this morning. What do you mean found him? Mike. What the hell happened? His position was compromised or given up. We don't know yet. I'm sorry, Mike. I'm so sorry. I promise you, I will find out who did this. You know Joey was like my brother. Do you need anything? No. I'll be in touch, Mike. I'm sorry. Dad! Dad, what's wrong? Dad. Your brother's dead. What happened? I don't know. He was working undercover. I know. You knew? Dad. I'm going over to Stacy's. Okay. I'll be back in a few hours. Joseph was not only a dedicated servant for his people, but a dedicated servant to God. A loving husband to his wife, father to his children and a friend to everyone who he knew. And in that love and compassion, Joseph sacrificed his life so that others may live safely. Brother Joseph, we pray for you. Now that you reside in God's kingdom and are eternally by his side. Amen. It never gets easier, Mike. You taught me that. And now we're burying Joey. We need to stop these sons of bitches. What can you tell me about my boy? These things take time. But know this, whatever needs to be done is being done. Every rock turned over, I'm gonna shake up every dirt bag. We'll get these guys, I promise. But off the record, they already sent a unit to pickup that scum bag, Arny Simms, who was Joey's way in. So hold tight. I've been thinkin', maybe Joey shouldn't have been there in the first place. You know, that's what gets you into trouble, thinkin'. Thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', that's what always has got you into trouble. What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. - No, tell me! I think you know exactly what it's supposed to mean, okay? You've been a lot of work, a lot of trouble, ever since you've been a little kid. Dad. And then as much as you don't like Harris, you are damn lucky that he found you instead of one of those other cops. That was a long time ago and you don't know the half of it. I don't know the half of it? I know that you beat the shit out of the Chief of Police's kid, okay? That was very embarrassing for me, Steve. You know why I beat the shit outta him? You know why that happened? Because I was protecting your precious fuckin' Joey. That's fuckin' why! My precious Joey was the decent one. You never knew when to stop. And you still don't. From where I'm sittin', Joey didn't know when to stop either and that's what got him killed. Yeah, well Joey always wanted to be like you. What's that mean? Maybe it should've been you instead of him. - Where the hell is this guy? - I told you gettin' the dope. Oh. So tell me how big that package is again. It's enough powder to keep you happy for a while, buddy. It's been a while. Hello, Arny. Hey, Vin. What, what are you doing here? I heard the cops picked you up today. What? Only held you in there for a few minutes and then let you go. I don't know, what does that say to you? They got nothing. They got nothing, I told 'em nothing, they got nothing. I mean, I told 'em nothing. You don't have to worry. Look, they didn't get nothin', please, Vinnie. Fuckin' rat! Don't do this. Hey! - Someone's coming. - Come on, come on. I need to talk with you. I'm going in. What do you mean you're going in? Joey let it slip, he's gone. You're fuckin' retired. Somebody's gotta do something. Frank Harris was my protege, okay? He's probably a better detective than I ever was. So just let the police handle it. I knew you'd say that, but I think this just might have to be done another way. How come I don't like the sound of that? I didn't think you would. Look, I go in as a fighter. I poke around, I ask some questions, some some answers. It's no big deal. You make one mistake they're gonna erase you from the planet and I don't need two dead sons. I'm setting things right for Joey and this family. I'm gonna start at O'Harrahs, a lot of bikers and fighters there. - Stop it. - No. - Fuck you. - I'll make some noise and make a name for myself. Make sure you don't make too big a name for yourself. Nice, very nice. I'm impressed. I like your moves, kid. Got a name? Sunny. You're here for a reason, right? Right. I'm guessing it's not me. But if you really wanna fight and make some cash. Come see my Friday at the Raging Tiger. You run the Raging Tiger? And we take very good care of our own. Cindy. Come here, darling. Why don't you show Sunny here a good time. Love to. Come on, stud. You're not shy are ya? Do you want me to be shy? Sunny. I was beginning to think You weren't gonna show. I wasn't, but then I realized I like money. Strike that, I love money. You came to the right place. After what I seen the other night, I got a feeling you're gonna be doing big things for me. Great. So I wanna introduce you to someone special tonight. - Who's that? - Upstairs, come on. Who we got coming in? Vinnie wants to bring in his new guy. - Bring him in. - All right. Come on. Santo, this is Sunny. He's one hell of a fighter. You're Sunny? Been making quite a name for yourself. Heard what you did to Vinnie's boy. Yes, sir. It's an honor to meet you, Santo. Okay. Now, if you can fight as good as he says you can, gonna make us a lot of money. I got great plans for a man of your talent, both inside and outside the ring. So, you know not everybody gets this meeting. So, hope you can live up to your expectations. If you don't, I'll be real disappointed. Understand? Perfectly. There's no worries on this one. Oh yeah? Well, you can see for yourself. Filling in for Matty, taking on Straight Razor. Should be a great fight then. Vinnie, put 10g's on our new friend here. Sure thing. Looking forward to watching you fight. This could be the beginning of a profitable relationship. Or the quick end. Yo, we're done here. Thank you, Santo. You suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck. You know, that was a really good fight, man. Yeah, you too. Thanks, I appreciate it. Yeah I know he dropped a left a lot, making him open to and overhand right. And then plus he kept leaning heavy on his front left making him open to leg kicks and sweeps. You got real ability for observing weaknesses. Ah, you just gotta take advantage of every chance you get. I'm Raymond. - Oh my name is... - I know who you are. Steve. I don't know what you're talking about. That's okay, I won't say nothing. Besides, no one's gonna know who you are. I barely did. You've been gone a long time. I don't know you. You just gonna walk away after I say that? - Yup. - And Vincent gets away with another one and you throw everything away that Joey stood for. You knew my brother, Joey? - I get it. - Get what? What I'm saying is, is I get it. You gotta make it right for your brother, and if I can help you, it kinda makes things right for me too. Look if they find out, we'll both be dead. I can't have your help, they'll kill us both. Look, I couldn't get revenge and make things for everyone. So I have to help you. I need to make things right for me and my brother too. - That is way too dangerous. - Hey Sunny. Hit the shower, head over to the doc and get that eye fixed up. Vinnie says you fight again tomorrow. What's going on, Joey? Undercover work, all right? I can't let you do this. Look, I got it covered, okay? It's good, it's good. You wanna come in? What's going on? Hey, Raymond. All good. You know you might wanna put a little bit of crazy glue on that cut before you fight tonight. Then again, these people want blood. Thanks man, I'll do that. All right. Yo, what are you doing after the fights tonight? Ah well, I don't know. Nothing much man, I'm probably just gonna head home. Yo, me and my girl are going out. She has a really cute friend. Wanna come? - Come on, man. - I don't know, man. You can't always be about business. You're gonna lose your frickin' mind. - Yeah? - Yeah, sure man. - Cool. - All right. Yo, hopefully you don't have to meet me in the ring tonight. You shouldn't have to explain to Alicia why your face is all messed up on the first date. Are you kidding me? - It's like that? - It is. - Oh, man. - See you later. All right man, you got it. Yeah! Very difficult. Looks like a suicide attempt. They're over here, Harris. That makes four fighters found dead. What do we got? Squat. I want answers, Gary, I want them now. You know the press is gonna be all over this. I think it's a little too late for that, Harris. Shit, not her. Keep this area blocked off. Detective Harris, what do we have over there? A fourth victim? Is there some kind of serial killer that's getting a hard on from fighters? Is that all necessary? So, you're making a confession? There is a serial killer on the loose? I never said that. Is there anything you'd like to tell me about that? I'm not at liberty to say. There's a homicide investigation, that's it. When I'm ready to make a public statement, you will be notified. Frank, I don't know if you realize this, but I have the power to help you. Don't act like you give a shit about these people. All that you care about is breaking the news first. You're a parasite. You, my dear, are hiding something. And that something happens to be a serial killer on the loose in this town. You're just afraid to leak information because you're afraid it's gonna damage your precious little career. I don't give a shit what you - say about me, okay? - Okay. But if you go around this town claiming that there's a serial killer, the entire town is going to go insane. And they have a right to know. That's right, but not by your bullshit. Then just tell me! All right, screw this. I can go under if I want. Listen. Meet me at the station house later tonight. Captain Bonds will give a statement. Get rid of her. Get outta here. Go, now! Well, those twos I told you about who were murdered, looked like they had been through a war zone. Had lacerations, contusions on their bodies and faces. - Creel, Creel, Creel, Creel. - Knife wounds? No, more like full contact fighting without gloves. What does the brass have to say about this? They want it done quickly and quietly, what else? Concentrate, smart ass. This is serious business. Don't screw this up. I know, I know. Look you guys chose me. We're gonna get these bastards. This is to Raymond for shutting up that women in the movie theater. - Oh, my God, yes babe. - I thought I was gonna kill her, oh my God. That lady was so annoying. I hate when people talk during the movie. It's obnoxious. That movie was so weird. Why was it weird? I thought it was pretty cool. Well, what I mean is it was weird, but in a cool way. What does that even mean, weird in a cool way. I don't know, it worked for me. Yeah, me too. I thought it was great. What about you, Sunny? How about you, Sunny, you like it? Sunny, you okay? Are we keeping you up? Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I just, I've just been fighting and training a lot lately. I'm exhausted babe, I don't mean nothing by it. Oh. - I'm just exhausted. - I got something that can keep you up. What did you say? - Thanks, bud. - Nothing, I said I've been fighting and training a lot lately too. Uh, that's not what he said. I said, well I said I got something you can keep up too. Okay, well I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - The subtle type. - Wow. You know what, I'm gonna come with you. We'll be back. Did you hear what the commissioner said the other night? You know he used to work with my father, right? Yeah. They found another two fighter's bodies. I known these guys a really long time. They were good dudes. Not like these other scumbags we see with no conscience. This is getting out of hand. The question is, what are we gonna do about it? I don't know. I got nothing. Well, we better dig up something quick or one of us might be next. I know, I was thinking the same thing. Let me do that. Oh, my God. I finally got a chance to get on the golf course again last weekend. It's about time. I didn't lose my touch. Detective Harris. Uh huh, yeah. No shit? Hold 'em there. We'll be right there. What happened? That junkie snitch Arny Simms, just got out of his coma. - You mean? - He's agreed to testify. So I'm looking at 25 on A, 1,700 on B. Yeah, I don't know about C yet. - See what happens I guess. - We'll see what happens. So that's uh. Grab that scumbag. Vincent Gaeta, you're under arrest for the murder of Joseph Colderon. You have the right to remain... This one is mine. You have the right - to remain silent. - Yeah, all right. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney. Whatever. Damn, I'm so pissed off right now. This shit's bad for business. Who the fuck coulda dropped the dime on Vinnie and Rocco? Maybe, I don't know. What you got something to say? It's just. What are you nervous or something? No. Well then spit it out. Listen, there's only been one thing different around here lately. Victor, I'm not into solving riddles right now, okay? - Sunny. - Sunny? Call it a hunch. I think we oughta kill him. What are you talking about? That kid's making me a shit load of money. You want me to kill him on a hunch? I've always been loyal to you and to this organization, Santo and I'm telling you, there's something not right about that guy. Put a tail on 'em then. No, this is gonna get the personal touch. I'll go follow him myself. Get it done then. My hero. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm glad you're here. Frank's got some good news. That's right, at 10:53 a.m., we arrested Vincent Gaeta with Joey's murder. That's great. Yeah, you sure you got enough evidence to make it stick? Oh yeah, we have witnesses, testimony, the snitch that got Joey in. And you're sure he'll actually talk? When someone as dangerous as Vincent shoots you twice in the chest and leaves you for dead, even the toughest of wise guys, they come crying to us for help. And that Arny Simms, he's probably one of the biggest cowards I've ever met. There you go, Steve. Your work's done for ya. What about the other 3 fighters that were murdered? Just because Vincent's gone doesn't mean they're gonna stop, and what about Santo? Come on, come on. It's none of your business. It's over. I need to finish what I started. Just keeps pushing it. He just doesn't wanna bury two sons. I know, but I can't just walk away now. Come with me. Look, I'm glad you feel the way you to. I don't like your tactics or the way you conduct yourself. Look, the brass is gonna come down on these guys, okay? Just give it a few days and then we'll get you back on the inside with our support this time, okay? I can't do that. Then I'm gonna have to bring you in. You hear me? Everyone is going to be swept up. There's a good guy on the inside, helping me out. His brother was killed just like Joey. What's his name? Raymond Cruz. Raymond, you got it. Thanks. Thank you. I'll be in touch. Oh yeah. It's him. But wait, I saw him with that cop. Shit. Arny too? God, you can't trust anybody these days. Want me to go in and take care of it? All right. I'll go pay our friend Arny a visit. What about Sunny? Creel, yeah. You remember this? I think you made this in wood shop. You know, I was watching you from the window. I was kinda hoping that you wouldn't drive away. Just like when I was a kid. No, for your entire life. Did you really want me sticking around, Dad? After everything I put you and mom through. Of course, you're our son. No matter how reckless and irresponsible you were, we always loved you. And we always will, come here. Thanks, Dad. You going back? Harris can handle it. Hello, Dad, hey. It's Arny. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, nobody's here right now, no. Yeah, I have been calling. Yeah, I'm sure you're busy. But um, why, 'cause I wanna see you. I need to see you. No, I'm clean. Dad, I'm clean I swear. 506 Ruth Court, yeah. You can't make it. What do you mean you can't make it? You have to make it. I don't think I can come to you. They don't allow me to leave. Can't you, a house guest? That sounds great. That sounds great, but uh. Okay, yes. Yes, I will come to you. I will see you. I'll come to you. I'll see you soon, okay? Okay, bye. Harris. What is it, Dad? No, Mike's fine, thank God. - He's off. - Who? That scumbag murdering piece of shit, Vincent, is off. How? They key witness, they found him with a bullet hole in his head. And the DA had not enough evidence to keep him and they let him free. Motherfucker. I'm so sorry, Steve. Me too. I'm going back in. I'll stop this myself. Normally, I wouldn't like to hear that. But at this point I really don't think we have another choice. So you're going to help me? Yeah. What do you think? You can't go in there alone. Maybe I know someone who will help. Raymond? I hope so. Okay. You make sure you contact me the minute you get in there. I don't wanna lose someone else I care about. Thanks, Harris. Alicia, I... Just don't even say anything, okay? You do you, all right? That's why I love you. I love you too, baby. He's awake. Yeah. Good to see you back with the living, Steve. What, nothing goes on in this town without me knowing. Now the one thing I do know is you're becoming a real pain in the ass. I know, I know. That's funny. Look, so is this. Vinnie! Didn't expect to see me again, did ya? Surprise! Save it, save it. We don't want him all messed up going into tonight's fight. It's a big anticipated death-match. Worth a lotta money. And nobody's gonna bet on a fighter already beat to shit. You're a lucky piece of shit, you know that? Get fucked! Stevie, boy. It's you that's gonna get fucked or do the fuckin'. It's a death-match. Fight to the death. So the outcome is completely up to you. I'm not doing shit, so just fuckin' kill me. You know what, really, I thought you would say something cute like that. But like always, Santo's first. Get him up. Fuckin' rat's son. Whole fuckin' family of rats. The whole family is rats. Yeah, fuckin' rats. Go ahead, go ahead. Look at me, look at me, look at me. Your fuckin' son is in there and he's gonna fuckin' die. How do you like that, huh? Go ahead, go ahead. You wanna get me don't ya, huh, huh? Go ahead, yeah, spit in my face. I wanna fuckin' drink it. Go ahead, go ahead tough guy. Huh, huh, huh? Give him a look inside. No, let 'em go! Give me a kiss, baby. Give me a fuckin' kiss, come here. Give me a fuckin' kiss. - Come on, whore. - I'll fuckin' kill yous all, - you motherfuckers. - Come on. - Ah shit. - Get off. Look at me, fuckin' look at me! Oh God, I ain't had a good laugh in years. Now look. I suggest you get ready for your next fight. What do you mean next fight? Give him the rules, Vinnie. The fight don't stop till someone's dead. That's simple, right? Now look, consider yourself lucky. I was gonna just feed you to Creel, but I decided to make a little more money. So you get to live a little while longer. I wanna rip your fuckin' heart out. You will fight the fight for eternity until it's your day to die. Now, if you make me enough money and fill my need, maybe, just maybe, I'll let them live. Take him to his cell. Come on, sit down. Go on, sit. - Come on. - Go fuck yourself. I'll fuckin' kill you all you... Yeah! Yeah. Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests of honor. I welcome you to the opening fight this evening.
