HE SAYS HE WILL GIVE ME 50,000 FRANCS BESIDES MY SALARY, WHICH IS VERY BIG, JUST TO SIGN THE CONTRACT. THAT IS HOW MUCH IN AMERICAN MONEY, MARIE? $10,000, MADAME. $10,000, MONSIEUR. $10,000. OUI, THAT'S A VERY BIG AMOUNT. AND EVEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME THE $10,000 AND I WOULD SIGN WITH YOU, YOU STILL WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TILL I FINISHED MY LONDON ENGAGEMENT. I COULDN'T DO THAT. YOU COULDN'T EVEN WAIT FOR ME? I COULDN'T EVEN GIVE YOU THE $10,000. OH. YOU THINK IT'S TOO MUCH, HUH? I THINK IT ISN'T ENOUGH. BUT I HAVEN'T IT. WHAT, UH, YOU EXPECT I SHOULD SIGN A CONTRACT FOR AMERICA WITH YOU? AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE $10,000? I HAVEN'T EVEN 1,000. I DID HAVE BEFORE I STOPPED OFF AT MONTE CARLO, BUT RIGHT NOW, I HAVEN'T EVEN 100. BUT I'LL SPREAD YOUR NAME ALL OVER-- THIS IS ENOUGH! YOU JUST TRIED TO MAKE THE FOOL OF ME. YOU ARE THE IMPOSTOR!

YOU GET IT FROM NOW ON EVERY DAY." "EVERY DAY 20 GALLONS OF MILK?" I SAY, "FLO, WHO CAN DRINK SO MUCH MILK?" AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS? "DON'T DRINK IT! BATHE IN IT! AND YOU WILL BE A BIG SUCCESS." NO! WELL, I'M TOO ANGRY TO SPEAK! IN PARIS I WAS A BIG SUCCESS BECAUSE THEY LIKED MY VOICE. IN LONDON I WAS A BIG SUCCESS BECAUSE THEY LIKED MY SINGING. BUT IN AMERICA, TO BE A BIG SUCCESS, I NEED 20 GALLONS OF MILK AND MUST SIT IN IT! HA! WELL, DO YOU BATHE IN IT, MADAME? NO, OF COURSE NOT. BUT EVERY DAY WE GET THE MILK, AND EVERY DAY WE TAKE IT IN BECAUSE MONSIEUR ZIEGFELD SAYS WE MUST CARRY OUT HIS IDEA. AND WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU READ THIS MORNING THE PAPER? NO, MADAME. READ. "ZIEGFELD IS SUED FOR ANNA HELD'S MILK BILL." ON THE FRONT PAGE. 20 GALLONS OF MILK! OH, I'M SO ASHAMED. MARIE, PLEASE CALL HIM AGAIN. IF HE'S NOT THERE, JUST LEAVE THE MESSAGE.

GOT A SORT OF A HABIT OF TELLING HER THAT ALL I KNOW IS WHAT I READ IN THE PAPERS, AND SHE SAYS THAT'S WHAT I OUGHTA TELL THE AUDIENCE. JUST SORT OF BE KIND OF A RUNNING GAG. SHE'S RIGHT. OH, SURE, BETTY'S ALWAYS RIGHT. BUT SHE DON'T HAVE TO STAND OUT ON THE STAGE AND CATCH THOSE OVERRIPE TOMATOES IF THE GAG DON'T WORK. MR. ZIEGFELD, I MUST INTERRUPT YOU. YEAH? THE FINALE COSTUMES ARE HERE. OH, GOOD. WILL YOU DO IT, BILL? I MIGHT. BUT THE COSTUMERS WON'T LEAVE THEM WITHOUT THE MONEY. GIVE THEM A CHECK. WILL YOU DO IT TONIGHT? MAYBE. THEY WANT THE CASH. DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THEY SENT THE COSTUMES FOR THIS SHOW C.O.D.? NO, SIR, NOT THIS SHOW. THEY WANT SOME MONEY ON THE LAST SHOW. RECKON YOU KINDA GOT YOUR SHOWS MIXED UP, AIN'T YOU, FLO? WELL, I RECKON, A LITTLE. WELL, IF I CAN HELP YOU OUT ON THE COSTUMES OR ANYTHING, WHY, LET ME KNOW. OH, THANKS, BILL, BUT I'M ALL RIGHT. WELL, TELL ME IF I CAN. OF COURSE, UH, I DON'T SUPPOSE IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE, 'CAUSE EVEN WITH THE COSTUMES ON, THE GIRLS IN THIS SHOW... AIN'T EXACTLY OVERDRESSED. HA HA! YOU SAVE YOUR WISECRACKS FOR THE AUDIENCE, BILL. HA HA HA! Ziegfeld: HEY, BUDDY! HEY! YES? WHAT'S THIS? YOUR OPENING NIGHT, YOUR BIG CHANCE, AND YOU'RE STILL MOVING SCENERY? WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT, MR. ZIEGFELD. IT GETS IN THE BLOOD. BESIDES, I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO GO OVER ON THE ROOF TONIGHT, AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE ONE JOB UNTIL I'M SURE OF THE OTHER. WELL, DON'T FORGET, WHEN I HIRED YOU AS AN ACTOR, I FIRED YOU AS A STAGEHAND. YOU BETTER MAKE GOOD. YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF WITHOUT ANY JOB. WELL, WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE? NO TROUBLE, I HOPE, MR. ZIEGFELD, EXCEPT-- EXCEPT HE'S HOLDING US UP! HE REFUSES TO LEAVE THE COSTUMES UNLESS HE-- UNLESS HE GETS SOME MONEY, AND HE'S QUITE RIGHT, SAMPSTON. LET ME SEE THE COSTUMES FIRST. AT ONCE, MR. ZIEGFELD, AT ONCE. OPEN UP THE BASKET. I TELL YOU, MR. ZIEGFELD, THESE DRESSES ARE WONDERFUL. THE FINEST WORK I HAVE EVER DONE. LOOK, MR. ZIEGFELD, ISN'T IT STUNNING? PERHAPS YOU MADE A MISTAKE. THIS ISN'T FOR ME. OH, YES, MR. ZIEGFELD, FOR THE FINALE. NOT MY FINALE. MR. SCHULTZ, THIS IS THE NEW AMSTERDAM THEATER. THIS IS THE FOLLIES. I KNOW, MR. ZIEGFELD, AND THIS IS THE COSTUME FOR THE FINALE. WELL, NOT FOR MY SHOW. WHY, I COULDN'T LET MY GIRLS APPEAR IN A THING LIKE THAT. THAT'S HORRIBLE! OH, TAKE IT AWAY. BUT, MR. ZIEGFELD, THEY WERE MADE FROM THE SKETCHES OF YOUR OWN DESIGNER. YOU YOURSELF MADE THE CHANGES ON THE SKETCHES WHEN YOU GAVE ME THE ORDER. OH, I NEVER ORDERED A THING LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE. THAT'S TERRIBLE! TAKE IT AWAY, TAKE IT OUT OF MY THEATER! BUT, MR. ZIEGFELD, I WORK OVER 3 WEEKS ON THESE DRESSES. I HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY INVESTED IN THEM. WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T HELP THAT. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? DISGRACE ME? NO, NO, MR. ZIEGFELD, BUT PLEASE, DO NOT DISGRACE ME. I MEAN, MR. ZIEGFELD, PLEASE, LET YOUR GIRLS WEAR MY COSTUMES TONIGHT. NO, I WOULDN'T HUMILIATE YOU. IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED, I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU SOME OTHER WAY, BUT, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ME TAKE THEM BACK, MR. ZIEGFELD. ALL RIGHT, BUT JUST THIS ONCE. SEND THEM UP TO THE DRESSING ROOMS. YOU SEE ME IN MY OFFICE NEXT WEEK. NEXT MONTH. NEXT MONTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. ZIEGFELD. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL, AREN'T THEY? AWFULLY EXPENSIVE. ALL RIGHT, GIRLS, PLACES FOR THE MELODY NUMBER! HE'S SINGING VERY WELL TONIGHT, MR. ZIEGFELD. YES, HE'S ALL RIGHT, BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH WHITE. MERV. YES, SIR. HE'S TOO WHITE. BRING UP THE PINK IN YOUR FOOTLIGHTS. ARE THE STEPS HIGH ENOUGH FOR YOU THIS TIME, MR. ZIEGFELD? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. WE COULD USE MORE, A LOT MORE. I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM HIGHER. HOW'S THAT, MR. ZIEGFELD? YES, THAT'S PERFECT NOW, MERV.

[GIGGLES] WELL, YOU SEE, I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE. LITTLE AUDREY IS A WEE BIT TIGHT TONIGHT. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] NO, BUT SERIOUSLY... YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T APPLAUD ALL OF US BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE WE OWE TO FLO. YOU SEE, I WAS JUST A LITTLE CHORUS GIRL WHEN FLO DISCOVERED ME. HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO WALK AND HOW TO DRESS AND HOW TO SMILE. SO... WELL... HERE'S TO...FLO. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] I AM AFRAID YOU MUST FORGIVE MISS LANE TONIGHT. SHE JUST PASSED THROUGH MANY WEEKS OF VERY TEDIOUS REHEARSALS AND THE NERVOUS STRAIN OF AN OPENING NIGHT. SHE'S NOT REALLY HERSELF. [APPLAUSE] ON BEHALF OF THE REST OF MY COMPANY, I WANT TO THANK YOU. YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND TO MY GIRLS AND MY STARS. SPEAKING OF STARS, THERE'S A YOUNG LADY HERE TONIGHT WHO-- IN MY OPINION-- IS DESTINED TO REACH THE TOP OF HER PROFESSION. SHE DOESN'T WORK FOR ME, I'M SORRY TO SAY, BUT I'M VERY PROUD OF HER. SHE'S HERE TONIGHT WITH HER PRODUCER--LUCKY FELLOW-- AND IF SHE WILL, I'M GOING TO ASK SALLY MANNERS TO TAKE A BOW. SALLY MANNERS. [APPLAUSE] DARNED NICE OF HIM TO PAY MY STAR A TRIBUTE LIKE THAT, ISN'T IT? YES, IT IS. I HOPE YOU'VE GOT HER ON A LONG CONTRACT. HA HA HA! ARE YOU READY, MR. ZIEGFELD? ALL READY.

SAGE, IF YOU'LL TAKE MISS MANNERS AND THE BOYS INTO YOUR OFFICE, I'M SURE SHE'LL HAVE SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY TO THEM. I CAN TELL THEM HOW HAPPY I AM RIGHT NOW. MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU? THANK YOU. RIGHT THIS WAY, MISS MANNERS. RIGHT THIS WAY. [ALL ASKING QUESTIONS AT ONCE] WHERE IS THAT GIRL YOU SAID WAS A FRIEND OF MINE? Woman: HERE I AM. I--I DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU.

NOPE. NO? NO. WELL, THAT'S FUNNY. I SEEM TO REMEMBER A CHAIR ON THE BOARDWALK, YOU BESIDE ME, AND, UH... ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T ATLANTIC CITY? IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATLANTIC CITY, BUT IT WASN'T ME. HA HA! OH, UH... OH! NOW I REMEMBER. WHY, IT WAS RIGHT HERE IN THIS OFFICE. YOU CAME UP TO SEE ME ABOUT A YEAR AGO. OH, NOW IT ALL COMES BACK TO ME. WELL, HOW ARE YOU? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? NO. NO? NO. YOU DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER THE TIME, THE PLACE, OR THE GIRL. HA HA. WELL... PERHAPS THIS WILL HELP YOU. [PLAYS CHILDHOOD MELODY] MARY LOU! WELL, HOW'S MY GIRL? HOW'S MY FELLA? HA HA!

IT NEARLY BROKE MY HEART. BUT BEING MARRIED IN NEW YORK DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, DOES IT? OH, HA HA! OH, YES, IT DOES, YOUNG LADY. NOW, WHY ARE YOU HERE, AND WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BIG KISS FOR ALL THE CANDY YOU SENT ME. WELL, YOU-YOU-YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THAT TWICE. HA HA. NOW, WHAT ELSE? WELL, I WANT TO GO INTO THE FOLLIES. YOU DO? MM-HMM. I'VE BEEN TAKING DANCING LESSONS FOR 2 YEARS. YEAH? HOW DO YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER FEEL ABOUT IT? WELL, I HAVEN'T A FATHER AND MOTHER ANYMORE. AW, I'M SO SORRY, MY DEAR. OF COURSE, JIMMY WON'T LIKE IT. WHO'S JIMMY? HE'S JUST ANOTHER FELLOW I'VE BEEN ENGAGED TO. OH! WELL... ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE CAN LOOK AFTER YOU. DO YOU THINK WE CAN HAVE DINNER TOGETHER TONIGHT?
