Directed by ?laf Sveinsson Hello, Hlemmur Bus Terminal here. Did they tell you that the Hofdabakki route is being closed down? Yes, it's supposed to close at six o'clock. My name is Bj?rgvin Ragnar ?orbj?rnsson. I'm a busdriver. I'm divorced. It's been nearly eight years now. I have one son. He's a grown man now. I haven't heard anything from him since 1991 or 1992 and that was on the phone. I lead a very ordinary life, no stress, no strain. Things are a lot better than they used to be. I bought myself an apartment near the bus station. It's within walking distance. I come here a lot. I meet people I know and like to chat to. I keep up with who's around and what's going on. A lot of it is very depressing. I think I've come to terms with myself. I'm fairly pleased with my life as it is now. I mean, comparing what I am now with what I used to be. But it took me twenty years in and out of rehabilitation before I realised how easy it was. All I had to do was come to terms with myself. I used to drink anything I could lay my hands on once. Didn't matter what it was. Spirits, beer, anything. I drank quite a lot of cardamom essence. I even remember drinking after-shave. I can't say it all tasted good but it all had the desired effect. But I drank spirits most of the time. When I was living like that, I owed money all over town. I used to sneak about, mainly down side streets, always ready to jump down an alley or behind the houses if I saw someone I owed money to. That makes forty five. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty... Six, seven, eight, and that Thank you my dear. I'll sit by the rubbish bin. You are closer to it. Here's the top. You have to turn it upside down. Didn't win anything. That's just on Coke bottles. Oh, Coke, yes. Couldn't have waited much longer. It's just because he knew we had some cash. He was quick enough then: Got it, got it he said. My name is J?sef Sumarli?ason. I was born in Keflav?k in 1949 and brought up in Hafnarfjord. I was one of eight children. Actually, there were 25 of us all together if I include my 14 half-brothers and sisters. I moved to Reykjavik in 1969. I've had a lot of different jobs in my time. But in recent years I've suffered from depression. And I haven't been able to work very much. I come here to the bus station with the first bus. And I'm here from 7 in the morning till about 8:30 - 8:45. Then I go down to the Vin, shelter at Hverfisgata 47. I have a bit of lunch there, then come back here to Hlemmur where they let me take a look at the newspapers and then I go back to the shelter and have a cup of coffee. Sometimes I go to the Samhjalp, have a coffee and a bite to eat there and then I go home. Aren't the days a little long? Yes, very long. Long and boring days. Not to mention the weekends. They're even worse. Let's get going then. Or you'll get beaten up again. Come on. I'll come later. You'll come right now. We've got a cab, come on. Stop that. Hey lads, stop it. Omar, you stay out of this O.K. I will. You have to keep to your part Yes, I know. How much was it? You know how much. I can't remember. 70,000 crowns. I haven't got it. If you don't keep to what you said yesterday when I gave you a good hiding then I'll finish you off now. You have to pay what you owe. Not my face, please. Look. You have to settle your debt. He hit me yesterday. Yes, he hit you yesterday. I can see that by the state of your face. I know exactly what happened. Where's that pack of cigarettes? What kind of trouble are you in, Hannes? None. I don't owe that guy a penny. What's this 70,000 crowns he's going on about, then? Borgthor's a loose canon... He's got his principles but if you cheat him he can be very dangerous. Your biggest problem, ?lafur Kalman Hafsteinsson, is that you've never learned how to keep your mouth shut. I spent the whole night on the bathroom floor, kicking at the door. I was in serious danger. There was blood everywhere, all over the apartment and there were bodies lying in heaps. I wasn't armed... and I couldn't get out through the window. It was too small. And I remember it well. It was a terrible experience And then I realized that I was in my bed all the time. The whole thing just took Place in my mind. You learn from that kind of thing and you stop being scared of it. At times I thought I was going absolutely crazy. That was no way to live. It was pure hell. I was on the binge regularly for the last ten to fifteen years. Couldn't see a way out. I just drank until I couldn't stand up any longer... drank myself paralytic. And for the last ten years I never ate anything when I drank. So I was suffering from malnutrition too. I saw on the scales that I'd, lost 10, 12, 14 lbs after a long binge. Not a dieting method I'd recommend. That was some mates from my home village of Borgarfjord. They were asking whether I was going to stop this bloody stupid nonsense. I said yes, I was going to try to stop. Let's see what tomorrow has in store. Hannes! Thanks for helping me out with this, mate. You do everything for me. - Yes. You look out for me so I don't have to do it. The only thing I know is you're my mate and I'd do anything for you. Hannes, come here. I'm at peace with God and my fellow men these days. And I feel good, very good. Has faith helped you? It's done an enormous amount for me. The Heavenly father and I talk every single night. It's a wonderful time. I never forget to pray. God also works through other people. I witness that almost every day. There aren't many people From my part of the country who can enjoy themselves just being alive like me. Even though I'm well into my sixties. Sorry, driver, I'm not having a go at you. No, I know you're not. Can I see your face? Is it Villi? - It's him. Do you know, I managed to You what? Three years sober. Why did you start again? What, you want an answer just like that, one, two, three? I just got drunk, Villi, there was no stopping it. But I'll sober again. You mark my words. I'm just asking you to get me a bottle, that's all. I'm just teasing you a bit. Oh, I see. I'm not drunk. Right, out you go, my friend. What's the problem? We're not allowed to serve drunk people. I am not in the least bit drunk. Well, that's the law... The law? Don't you talk to me like that or you'll be on the losing end. It's not a good idea to argue with a man when he's drunk. We're here. Are you going to pick me up? It's too late. Can't do it. You haven't had to pick me My loved ones? That's a sad tale. I had a wonderful wife, a really wonderful wife. S?lveig Margr?t ?skarsd?ttir. We had 4 children together, Twin girls and two boys. But, unfortunately, it all disappeared into thin air - thin air - Eight grandchildren. Don't you think it hurts not being a part of that any more? Of course it hurts. I often feel the pain and it makes me cry. Then night comes. The sadness goes when the sun shines in the morning. Then some bastard came here and stole my blanket. I kept it under that tree. What was it like in the winter under the tree? It was a bit cold sometimes. A bit cold sometimes. When there was a snowstorm blowing, It was a bit cold then. But I didn't whine about it. Just woke up, had 3 or 4 bottles of cardamom essence with me - that sorted me out, got the old circulation going again It's often been hard, mate. When I had to get up out of the snow, that was really hard. Didn't happen often, but it happened every now and again. As far as my depression is concerned and all the problems it caused. It all started up quite suddenly around 1970, even though I wasn't really aware what was happening at that time. It wasn't until 1979 that I sought help and went to see a psychiatrist. He found a solution, a temporary solution, to my depression. I was able to carry on working. I started living with someone in 1978. We had two sons, Actually I met her earlier in 1976. So we have two sons. They're 23 and 19 years old now. And they're doing very well, my sons. We broke up in 1982, the same year I stopped working. In 1983, I was admitted to a day-care programme at the Kleppur psychiatric hospital and I remained on that programme through 1983, 1984 and 1985. Withdrawal is dreadful, Absolutely terrible. That's why you keep drinking? Yes, that's why I keep drinking That's why I don't stop. Withdrawal is no joke. It's takes so much out of you, my young friend, it's such a struggle that It's like hell itself, if there is such a place as hell. Why? Feeling really bad. The guilt, the tremors. And all the things you see that aren't there. Rats crawling up the walls and... and... and... Can I have some brennivin? Want to buy some? Try to buy it. Want to know how much it costs? It costs a lot. Look at the woman, the child and the trees. I always come home to sit under my tree and be next to my fair roses. Right, now I'm going to stop. Right, we're closing up now. We always close at twenty past. ?li, come on now, we're closing. Come along. Out you go, I said. No. You don't want me to have you removed, do you? No. Outside. What's gotten into you? Want a thump? Come on, out you go. Where were we arrested yesterday? We didn't ask for somewhere to spend the night? No, no. I can't remember where we were nicked. Klambrat?n Fields? Yes, we were sitting on a bench there... ...remember? We were on the Longuhl?d side. Remember the bench? It was when you left to buy a bottle and I waited there the whole time. I came back at least. Yes, that's where we were arrested. Were we arrested there? Yes, on the bench. All my money's gone. That's a bit strange too. Did you go to the bank yesterday? You let me have 500 crowns. Five hundred? It was a lot more than that, mate. You gave me 500 crowns. No, 6,000! And you went and bought the booze while I waited up at Klambratun. We hadn't had more than a few swigs when the cops came. I can't remember what time it was. Did I get a bottle of Smirnoff bootleg? Yes, I let you have a 5,000 and two 500 notes. I let you have 6,000 crowns. What about the Baccardi then? I don't usually buy that. No, hold on a minute. We met... I met Sigr?n at Bjarkaras. Then we got to know each other And we've been together now for about ten years. Are you married? No, just engaged. If we got married we'd lose out big time. It would take a chunk out of our disability pensions if we did that. There's enough taken off us as it is. That's why we're not going to. Anyway, there's no need to get married. Being engaged is fine. I mean, a lot of people do, then get divorced and land in all kinds of trouble, dividing up their property, selling their cars, splitting everything in two, and maybe you get a bigger share and maybe a smaller share. That's not for me. It's much better for us like this. No messing about. That's the thing, yes mate. Yes it is. So, you're happy together with things as they are? Yes, we get along very well. That's important. Life's no bed of roses for some people. Some people have a very hard time and are really miserable. Where did you go? I don't know. I saw you go into Eskihl?d. Then you told me, when you got back, that you made some phone call at some woman's place or somewhere. I called a cab to get to the off-license. That can't be, the off-license was closed by then. Six o'clock? Yes, yeh... no, it might have been before 6 o'clock. Yes. I think I ordered a taxi to go a get a bottle for me. That's the bottle you bought. But what about the Baccardi? We never got to drink more than that. But what about the Baccardi? I haven't got a clue where you got that from. Well, I don't know. It's not what I usually buy. You must have just found it. You only bought the Smirnoff. Yes, but I don't usually buy Smirnoff either. I always buy Tinda vodka. Then you bought this under the counter. I do very little. Nothing at all, really. Just hanging about, as I like to say. Haven't done a stroke of work for seven years. I get a good disability pension from Sweden because that's where I became disabled. That's where I earned the right to a pension. I get 72,000 crowns a month from Sweden and 41,000 crowns here. In Iceland I have it good. I don't get a lot of pleasure out of life other than watching the days go by. And I do that mainly riding on the buses because it costs so little, no more than 30 crowns a time. But I'm at full pace while I'm on the bus, at least between bus-stops. It all fits together very nicely. You have a lot of friends here at the bus station. All my new friends are alcoholics. I have no contact with my old friends. I keep a very low profile. I have no contact with my old friends. Isn't that what you wanted yourself? Yes. It'll all be fine. It will all be fine. All will be well. I will have contact with my old friends again. Oh, yes, we get very good benefits. I have nothing to complain about in that area. It's boring to listen to people complaining all the time. It gets you down. I don't want any part of that. You want to enjoy life. Enjoy life, yes, like anyone else. That's the attitude. Otherwise life's no fun. No, that's what it's all about, my friend. This is a good place. The food here is very good. And the people are good. They've helped me a lot. We have an apartment on Reynimel - number 80. It' owned by the Reykjav?k Council and we just rent it. It's better living alone. You're not independent if you live in a shelter. You have to do what you're told there and let someone know what time you want to leave the house or come home. And they take charge of your money, too. We didn't like that. It's much better for us to have our own apartment, live together and rent rather than live with lots of other people. I was very shy as a teenager, withdrew into my own shell, I was exceptionally shy then but I'm not any more. That's all changed now? Yes, yes. I'm very decisive without being at all bossy. Full of self-confidence without being arrogant. A lot of people around here have told me that you're quite a wit. Yes, I suppose I am. No one's been able to outtalk me so far and I'm not sure they ever will. Nothing wrong with what I've got between my ears even though I have the physical symptoms of my illness. The best thing... today, no, not tomorrow... It's Monday today and if it was tomorrow, the most enjoyable thing would be acting. Acting is just great. Best thing in the world. Do you act a lot? We act at schools and factories, various types of entertainment. One of the plays we do is called The Last Flower. And then there's another called - The Carnival. Then, there's a play called Comedy. It's a new one with some mime in it. I have been drinking since February 1st last year after I was given a permanent disability benefit. I think I'd been working on a trawler for about 10 years until that time, and like the doctor said to me, he said, if you want to destroy yourself completely just keep working on the boats. Then I spent 31 months in prison. After that I pulled myself together. I cleaned up my act and stopped acting liking a lunatic. I have three children. I have a son who is 18, another son who is 10 and a 3-year-old girl. None of them is registered as mine. I'm not bitter about life. I have my whole life ahead of me. My whole life ahead of me. I could have killed myself ages ago if I'd wanted to. Even so, I hope every single night that I won't wake up the next day. Then it would all be over. But it never seems to happen. I always wake up. One psychiatrist suggested that there was a mental defect in my family. But I haven't followed it up with any other psychiatrist I've been to or the one I see once a month these days. What is your relationship with your sons like? Not so bad. Not so bad. I haven't had any contact with them, though, for quite a few months now. But when we do meet up I enjoy the time we spend together. On a day-to-day basis, I don? T really give it much thought. Every day has enough troubles of its own. How did your relationship with your wife end? She met another man. I didn't do a very good job of providing for her and the boys. That was the main reason we broke up. That must have been painful and difficult to accept at the time? It was difficult to accept, very difficult. It was she who broke it up. I wanted to keep it going as long as possible but it didn't work out. She'd got herself a new bloke before I knew what day it was. I was in and out of work at the time. I couldn't really look after them properly. So, it was bound to end sometime and that's what happened. The place is still full of rubbish. But it was an absolute tip when I moved in. I've painted in here and I'll just have to see how things go and what I can afford to do at the moment. Come on into the living room. It was really dreadful in here when I came. Piles of boxes, bags, sacks and mattresses all over the floor. The crowd who lived here before weren't worth a toss. But there's been quite a few changes since then. I feel good here. Alright, let's continue through. This is the bedroom. It's taking shape now, getting to look the way I want it to. This apartment is my resurrection, if I can put it like that. I've been renting for nearly eight years. And it's even more recently that I got myself straightened out. The future looks bright. The main thing is never to give up. There'll always be difficulties. But you can overcome them if you try. He'll be tired by the time he gets to Reykjav?k. Who is Hannes Stub-finger? You know Hannes Stub-finger. Oh, yes, him. He'll be tired all right. What did he do with the 500 crowns you gave him? That I gave him? Well, he stole it of course. Then he stole 10,000 from me plus a whole bottle of booze and 3 litres of Coke and 2 packs of Lucky Strike. And I had to pay for a cab for him up to Borgarfjord. I was so angry when I found out that I took hold of him and threw him out of the cab and into the water at Rau?avatn. I don't give a shit whether he made it back to land or not. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Raggi. I'll have three bottles of medicine or so. There you go. Thanks. Well, hello there. I have 4 children, two of them grown up now. My wife lives in Sweden. There was an advert in the Morgunblad newspaper for paramedics needed at a hospital in Sweden. It was in Lund in Sweden that hospital. So we went out there and she got a job. Sweden was going through a boom at the time and I got a job too. So, that's how we came to be in Sweden. They advertised for paramedics in Sweden and I went along as part of the deal. Were the children born there? No, we already had two and the third was born in Sweden. She was born there, my daughter Monika. What sort of a relationship do you have with your kids? Almost none - on account of my illness. I don't see the children very much at all. So this illness has had a major impact on your life? Yes, it has. And for the worse, very much for the worse. My wife divorced me because I had changed so much from the man I once was. My wife got a divorce. I wanted us to stay together but it was out of my hands. Concerning your illness - do they know what caused it? No, not really. All mental illnesses. Depression, for example, is a result of a chemical imbalance in the brain. That's how depression starts. I haven't read much about manic depression or how it works. When my problem first appeared I was pig-headed about going through the appropriate tests but I knew there was nothing dangerous about them and did them in the end. I was diagnosed as being sick. It was an explanation that had simply not occurred to me because I didn't feel bad at all. In fact I felt just fine. If there was anything I could do, my greatest wish is to be healthy again. Do you have any help other than medical help? No. I take the only medication available for this illness. I take in regularly as I said earlier. Everything takes time I will get better. I'm absolutely sure of that. I am the wind. I am the wind. I am the wind. The sun is the greatest power. Weren't the apes in the trees covered in hair? Yes, and they still are. And they still are, yes. Now, there's one less ape in the jungle. It has to be the same both sides. That's what happens when you don't go for a haircut. I usually go to the barber's once a month. You should try to keep that up. Increase your self-esteem. Look at your ears. Fine on this side. I have to trim a little more on this side. Damn right you do. But leave your head on. I reckon it could be taken off. Great, I've finally gotten rid of it. How long's it taken - eighteen months? No, I've only had it a week. No way. Maybe a fortnight. Not fibbing. Maybe a fortnight. Maybe a fortnight. I started drinking on February 1st last year. 1982 was the year I was last out on the general job market. Went to work then at Bergidja inside the Kleppur Hospital in a protected working environment and I stayed there until 1993. I have never thought about whether it was fair or not, finding myself in this position in life. I've never given it a thought. This is just the way it is. You have to accept reality. I wouldn't lie to you. I might lie to everyone else but I don't lie to you. I've told you, both hungover and sober, that you are the only friend I have outside this circle. I've told you so many times. Yes, you've often said that. I just hope it's sunk in. But I don't like the fact that you're always getting beaten up. That's their problem. What? That's their problem. No, you are part of the problem. No I don't. The only problem I have is that my mother gave birth to me. Never say that. That's the only problem I have, you see. My mother brought me into this world, that's the problem. That's not a problem. You are the problem. I'm not the problem. The only problem I... Never say that. Jon Petur, Barbara and Ingimundur, Kristjan T. Hjortur, Hafrun, Hjortur Egils, Arni Pals. Everyone's here then. I'm going to read the word of God, from St. Luke. The Gospel of Luke, Chapter 16, from verse 14. And the Pharisees also who were covetous, heard all these things and derided him And He said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but God knoweth your hearts For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God? Last Christmas I got here late on Boxing Day afternoon. I had a very hard time turning up. I'd been sober for about two days. That was only because it was Christmas and I couldn't get hold of a drink and I was broke. I slept outside the whole time and it was very cold indeed. I was up at Klambrat?n under what I call my tree. Yes, I was there. I had very little to eat both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. A few tins of sardines which I got on December 23rd. I was really in a state when they came to fetch up. They'd heard what sort of state I was in and invited me to come directly here, which I did. I was quite surprised how quickly I pulled myself round. They gave me an amazing welcome here. Everyone rejoiced the fact that I had come. And that helped me quite a bit. That meant I didn't get a chance to feel sorry for myself. Things have changed quite a bit since last summer so I decided just recently to try occupational therapy and I've started that now. That was quite a setback in 1993 when I couldn't even bring myself to work half a day at Bergi?jan. So, this is quite a jump for me now. But I'm feeling confident about it. Do you feel better about life? A great deal better. Nothing special has happened except I still feel good and things are improving all the time. I've handed in my notice. I wanted a change and moved closer to my home grounds. I didn't see much point in dragging myself out of bed at 5 a.m. To do the morning shift or in coming home at 1:30 in the morning after doing the night shift. That will all change when I get a job around here and I have a few other ideas up my sleeve too. Naturally, I feel very lonely sometimes. I wish I had a wife waiting for me at home, someone to talk to when times are good, someone who enjoyed sharing her life with me, a person who took part in everything with me. But when you reach my age there's not that many women who are interested. I've thought about it. If I were to put myself on the marriage market, as it were, I realize that most women my age will have one, two, maybe even three marriages behind them. They'll have kids, debts and problems that I have no interest in taking on my shoulders at this moment in time. Now, I've just sorted out my own problems, I'm not going to burden myself with someone else's. It's as simple as that. But there are plenty of other options open to me. I've been taking a look around. For example, at some marriages of guys I know to Asian women. Asian women seem to be very good-tempered and sweet. And I've come to know a few of them personally and could well imagine settling down with one of them. Preferably someone of about 35. I well believe it might work out. I've seen couples where there's an age difference of 30 years and it's worked out just fine. So, why not? It would be wonderful to watch a child grow up now I'm in good health again. Nothing wrong with that at all. I think it would be wonderful if I could do just that. It's cold out now. Hello, my dear friend. Now you're with your Heavenly Father and feel well. I will always remember you my dear Hannes, and pray everyday that you receive the Lord's blessings. I miss you, my brother, but I know you are safe now. We'll meet again, sometime. God bless you. You see they've taken my bench away. And there's nowhere for us to sit anymore. So, we don't have a home. They're gone, Halfdan Ingi, my friend Hannes, and Elmar. I find it very hard to roll of the names. It's so terrible that I'd rather try to forget it. Seven or eight of them, maybe more have gone. That's how it is. It's a miserable business. I have quite a few debts on my back. But I'm trying to make regular monthly payments. But I can't see things sorting themselves out for a few years. It's been thirteen years. I thought I'd clear things up over one or two years and pay them off but things haven't worked out at all well. I've tried to do what I could to have some of them cancelled. But that didn't work either. Hopeless actually. How are things with you and your sons? Can you give them anything? Not a single penny. I haven't been able to for many years. Although I did manage sometimes to give them a little something especially at Christmas. But that's all over now. What's more, my relationship with the boys is very limited, and has been for many years. Ever since their mother and I split up in 1982. I've had so many emotional traumas. When the wife left me, I loved her and the children and my home and my company. But I lost them all, of course. Then I started living with someone, got married again, and we had a little boy. He died very young and very suddenly on New Year's Day. That finished me off. That was in 1976. I went to a doctor and lied to him, said I couldn't sleep that I was going crazy from lack of sleep. It was a complete lie. But I got some sleeping tablets from him. I ground them down, bought a bottle of vodka and took a cab. Out to Rau?avatn There's some protected woodlands there. I left the car there, went into the woods, took all the pills then drank the vodka. I remember it so very well. It was spring. Really beautiful weather, a beautiful evening. There was a ewe in the woods, giving birth to a lamb. I remember when the lamb tried to stand up. That's the last thing I remember. Except that someone had seen the sheep and contacted the official who is in charge of livestock within the Reykjavik area. He came to fetch this sheep and found me with my pills and bottle of vodka beside me. I was blue all the way up to my waist. And he called an ambulance and they gave me a stomach pump and I was taken to jail. That's where I woke up. And when I woke up I was crying my eyes out. Yes, I can say with conviction that I approve of National Socialism. I'm fully admit it. I think it's a sound philosophy. I have no faith in any of the parties here in Iceland. And certainly not in those who are in the government. That's my opinion. Would you perhaps show me your mobile? My phone? Of course. This is what it's like. That's a beautiful symbol. I have always been an admirer of Nazi philosophy. And it will take root here just as it has in other places. I don't think there's any stopping it. I've heard it's already started. We are a small nation. All sorts of people have flooded in here. The streets are filled with blacks. I have no idea where they come from, what they're doing here, or what's behind it all. I don't know whether anyone is even keeping an eye on them or what they bring into the country with them. Before long there'll be serious crime here, And then there'll be murders. You murders. And that's one of the first things you hear. And as soon as you mention the subject you get a response. That's very revealing. That's how things are. It's a fact that I feel very attached to Rockville because when I came here, like I said earlier, this was just a ghost town. I started here with just a 40 watt light bulb in a caravan and there was no running water and no lavatory. I just went out on the balcony and washed myself in the snow. And there was no shortage of snow when I first came here. Yes, I feel I've made this place my own. But deep down inside, I don't feel I want to spend the rest of my life here, slaving away from morning to night. I've worked without wages At the same time, I get free meals and accommodation. But I feel I want to do something more demanding because I'm in great shape, considering my age and what I've been through. Great shape. I want to go home to my own place and I'm working on that right now. Come on boy, sit down, That's it, sit down. Translation: Alfaith_is_lost and monzack. Synchronization: Tarkovsky
