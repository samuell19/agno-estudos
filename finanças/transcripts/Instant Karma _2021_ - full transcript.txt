Hi, um, can my friend come with? Uh. It's my first day. I don't really know all the rules. Yeah, sure, why not? Okay. So I'm guessing you all are students? Wow, you must be smart for a U-Lift driver. [laughs] Come on, give me a break. Hey, I did let your friend come along for free. Sorry, we had a big test and it kicked our ass. No worries. - What are you studying? - [Latisha] Marketing. Oh, that's cool. That's what I studied. And now you're a U-Lift driver. Wow, we are totally screwed. We might as well just drop out now. [girls chuckling] Marketing is a good major. I just hit a string of bad luck, but it's only temporary. You will for sure get good jobs when you graduate. We'll worry about that some other time. We're gonna hit some shrooms. Do you wanna join? [chuckling] Um, I wish, but I have a big marketing job interview to get to. Plus, it might be a little hard to explain to my girlfriend. All right, here we are, ladies. [Latisha] Well, thanks for the free ride. - Have fun with the shrooms. - [Sandy] We will! [murmuring patrons] You probably thought I wasn't gonna show up, didn't you? Look, I got you something to drink. It's okay, Mom. I'm fine, thanks. You know you need to stay hydrated or you'll get your headaches. Yeah, Mom, I know. Okay, I'm an adult, remember? Well, if you acted more like an adult, then I wouldn't have to remind you of so many things. This is what you should be drinking. It not only hydrates you, it boosts your energy, it aids your digestion, it provides you with antioxidants, it detoxifies your liver, improves your eyesight, and it will even help you with your constipation. Jeez, Mom! Why don't you say it louder so everybody can hear? Sorry. You know I worry. I just wanna make sure you're okay. I know, and I appreciate that, but sometimes you just need to dial it back a little bit. Oh, my God. Mom... Why didn't you tell me that it tasted like... licking somebody's underarm? Well, it is fermented. You know, like sauerkraut. And it's the fermentation process that provides you with all the health benefits. Great. Never mind. Tell me, how are you doing? How's the new job at the computer company? What's wrong? - I got laid off. - You what! Why? You just started there last month. Does it matter why? Maybe. - Did you do something wrong? - No, I didn't do anything wrong. - Was it the hair? - No, Mom! Okay, just calm down. They were making cuts and I was the new guy, so it was me. But it's okay, relax. I already have a new job. Really? That was quick. Where? U-Lift. [groans] U-Lift? Driving people around? Jeff, you know that's not a real job, right? It is a real job. And, actually, I have to get back to work. So thank you for the fermented sauerkraut drink, - but I'll see ya later. - Jeff! I... I didn't mean that. You know I love you. And I know it's a real job, but it's just temporary, right? [door opens and closes] Oh, hey babe. Hey! Oh, that looks good. Hi. Mmm. Oh, I missed you. How was your day? Uh... it... it was a day. Okay. But I think I made over $100, so that's not too bad for my first day. - I don't care about that. - Mm? Well, I do, but... how was your day? How about some wine first? Yeah. [wine bottle thuds on table] [sighs] All right, where do I begin? Okay, well my first riders were these college girls who invited me to do mushrooms with them. Uh, did you? No, of course not. - Come on. - I... I just... Okay, well, then, things got really weird after that. There was this couple that I picked up and they were... they were dressed all in black clothing. They had this like goth type makeup on and... and what I hope was fake blood just dripping from their chins. I tried to talk to them. I said their costumes were cool, but they just grunted and growled at me. - Weird. - Oh! And guess where I dropped them off. A cemetery. What? That is so creepy! Uh, they left me five stars and a pretty good tip, so... eh. Was that the worst of it? No. I wish it was. The worst part was meeting my mom at the coffee shop. You know, I think she cares about me, but I don't know, sometimes she can just be just so condescending, and she told me today that she doesn't think U-Lift is a real job. And it just made me feel really crappy, you know? Yeah. I'm just happy to be home with you. So, do you travel a lot? To some people it might seem like a lot. To me, it's not too bad. - I still enjoy it. - Cool. Do you have a favorite place? Oh, do I! Yeah, that would be India. Wow, India. And why's that? [Sighs] Wow, where would I start? To me, India is just... the natural beauty is just awesome. The diversity of people. The sheer nature of it. And the people there, wow, just so amazing. [engine sputtering] Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa! What the hell? - [Jeff] Ugh! - [engine turns off] - Crap! Could it get any worse? - What's going on? Because of you, I'm gonna miss my meeting. - Have you ever gotten a zero star rating? - Oh, come on, man. What happened to all that peace and love and friendship stuff? All that stuff was left back in India. I need to get to my meeting now. Okay, look, I'm sorry. I... I tell you what. I'll take off the charge for the ride, and... You can have this too. That's all the money I have. Please don't give me a bad rating. I need this job. How are you gonna be a U-Lift driver with a piece of junk of a car? You need some help? Shouldn't I be asking you that? [laughs] With the car, I mean. You need to move it. Um, yeah, thanks. Thanks man, I... I really appreciate the help. Sure thing. I'm sorry, I just gave my last cash to the rider. [Sam] So, what's the news? I lost my job. You got fired from U-Lift? No, I can't drive U-Lift anymore because my stupid car broke down. And the mechanic said it would be $1,000 to fix, which I can't afford. I see. Sam, I don't think you understand. If I don't work, we can't afford rent. And we'll get kicked out of our house. We can't afford to live together, so I'll be forced to go move in with my mom. There's no way in hell that's happening. So, basically we're done and I'm going to be homeless. And you don't think you're overreacting like just a little bit? No, no, I don't. My life is shit right now. I am on the worst string of bad luck. Nothing is going right, everything is falling apart, not just my stupid car. - I think I'm cursed. - Maybe so. But you know what they say, "It's always darkest before the dawn," and all that. So, um, who knows? Maybe today is the day that everything changes. What does that even mean? Are you gonna give me some positivity pep talk? [laughs] No. Remember my friend from work, Kumar? Uh, yeah, he's the IT guy, right? Yeah, well, he told me this morning that he's going to India for three months to visit his home city of Baroda. Okay, so how is that good news for me? Because... he gave me his car and said that I can use it whenever I want while he's gone so it doesn't just sit around. And it's a really nice car. Much better than the old smokey that you were driving. So... you can use it, if you want, until yours gets fixed.

Can you believe that? Jeez. Is that when you punched him in the face? I should have. Instead, I just threw my beer at him and left. [chuckles] Well, good for you. But, still, that really sucks. It does. But it's all right because when I left his place, I went to his brother's and slept with him. Nice sign. Hey, I know that guy. Wave him over. [passenger] Hey, come here. Hey, man, thanks again for the help with my car. You're welcome, sir. I really appreciate it. You did me a favor. You deserve this. Thank you, General. Your Majesty. [light music] Well, I'm sorry things didn't work out with his brother, but I hope things work out with his cousin. - I've got a good feeling. - [chuckles] Thanks for listening. Oh, hey, you dropped some money. Not mine. [ethereal music] Huh. I can't even describe how happy I was all day after finding that money. I felt like I was floating. What'd I tell ya? I know, but... [sighs] What's wrong? [sighing] I'm really happy right now. I can't even describe it. But I'm also excited and... and scared too. Scared? Why? What's wrong? Well, this is the first bit of good luck I've had in awhile, and... I hope it's a sign of things to come, but I'm scared it'll all be over before I know it. So, I'm worried and wondering how to keep it going. Jeff, honey, relax. Luck, good fortune, magic... whatever you wanna call it, you can't keep it going any more than you can keep a wave going. You just have to ride it for as long as it lasts and then, like surfing, keep an eye out for the next one and get ready for it. [light music] - Can you pop the trunk? - Sure. - Do you need a hand? - Nah, I got it. [trunk opens] - [suitcase thuds] - [trunk beeps] Hey, hope you didn't put a dead body in there. Not the entire body. Just some parts. Just kidding. It's just some gear I'm using for a workshop I'm doing. Hey, do you mind if I make a stop real quick? [passenger] Sure, go ahead. Hey. - Are you following me? - [Jeff chuckles] - Busted. - [laughing] What are you doing all the way over here? What? I can't come downtown because I'm currently without a residence? No, you're just a long way from where I saw you last time. You must be tired as shit from walking all that way. I don't have any money on me right now, but, um... hold on. That's mighty nice. Thanks. I gotta run, but I can come back and give you a ride after I drop my passenger off. Not necessary. But thanks for the lunch. [trunk beeping] Uh, can I help you with these? I should be able to carry it on if you just wanna hand it to me. - Thanks. - Yeah, sure. And what about your bags? Um, they're not mine. Gotta go. Don't wanna be late. [ethereal music] Huh. [trunk beeping] [door opens] [door closes] Wow... What are all these? I mean, I am hungry. - What are you making me for dinner? - [sighs] I haven't even thought about that yet. Are you sure you didn't leave some groceries in the car? Mm-hmm, I'm sure. Why do you keep asking? Well, if you didn't leave groceries in the car and none of my riders did, I didn't buy this stuff. You know you shouldn't drink on an empty stomach. Come on, let me make you some dinner. - Come on. Come on. - Yeah. [giggles] I know I can't make luck continue... but I sure would like to know what's causing this. You know, like how waves are caused by the wind? Isn't it enough to know that maybe you're just having some good luck and things are finally going your way? Yeah, I guess. But if I could just figure out what's causing this wave, then... maybe I could get in the sweet spot - and ride it for as long as possible. - Mm. Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on. - I need your help on this. - Okay. I'm in. I'll help. Okay. So I found money and a bunch of groceries in my car... Well, in your friend's car... After I dropped off two passengers. And it didn't belong to your passengers? Correct. Then you dropped off other passengers, but didn't find anything with them, right? So, what did those two passengers have in common that wasn't true for the other passengers? [slams table] I got it. I got it! [laughs] Okay. You gonna tell me? I got it! You'll know tomorrow if I'm right. Jeff! Well... [birds chirping] Hey. - Hey. - Hmm. I'm gonna go do some early driving so we can hang out later this afternoon, okay? Okay. What did you want me to pick up for you? Um, some running shoes. Mine are getting worn out. Okay, what kind? Uh, just the kind that I have is fine. Where are they? - Under the bed. - Okay. Now go back to sleep. [sizzling] - [doorbell ringing] - Hmm. Hey... babe. [Jeff] Hi. [Sam] Uh... [Jeff grunts] Excuse me. [Sam] Okay. Oh, my gosh. What did you do? [Jeff] I have a little bit of a surprise for you. - [Jeff grunts] - What did you do? [laughs] I hope you like these. Uh... [laughs] Um. Babe, these are awesome! Why are there so many? I mean, I'm not mad, I'm... that's great, but why'd you buy so many? I didn't buy these. What do you mean? I didn't buy these. I found all these boxes in the back of the car. And I think I know now what's causing this wave of good luck for me, you know? Well, what is it? It's a homeless guy. I... I mean, can you believe that? It's a homeless guy. Okay, so when you say "homeless," you mean like... I don't know exactly, but... but every time I give him something, I get back 10 times as much. So I gave him $20 and then I got back $200. And one day I gave him lunch, and we got all those groceries. So today I gave him your old pair of running shoes and found all these boxes in the back of my car. I think he's like a magical good luck charm. Or a... a magical wave. Well, I think that we should ride this wave for all it's worth. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. [laughs] Okay. - To Homeless Guy. - [Jeff laughs] Mm. Oh, this is some really good wine. I found it in the groceries that were in the car. But I think we only have one bottle left. I sure would like some more. How about you? You wanna give wine to a homeless guy? I mean... - To Homeless Guy. - To Homeless Guy. [light music] Josh West? Dude, are you kidding? Man, I've been a fan of yours since you were on The Voice. And I love your band Vanilla Aardvark. Thanks, man, I appreciate it. No, I'm serious. I listen to your music all the time. Awesome. Are you ready to go? Yeah, sorry, man. I didn't mean to go all fan boy on you there. No worries. Hey, uh, Josh, sorry to bother you, man. Mm-hmm. Can I ask you a big favor? Sure, what's up? Would you mind singing a song for me? Well, not for me, but for my girlfriend. She loves you too. But she's not here. Not a problem. [line ringing] Babe... guess who I have in the car right now. [Sam] I don't know. Your mom? [chuckling] Not even close. It's Josh West from Vanilla Aardvark. - Yeah, right! - No, I'm serious. And guess what. He said he would sing a song for you.

To riding the magic wave. And... to getting more. [Jeff chuckles] To having more. Anything else? Well, I have been thinking. And I think that we need to be more strategic. What do you mean? Well, don't get me wrong. I love getting all the things and the fact that we've been able to make a couple thousand dollars from selling the surplus is great. I just think it's time that we got back to the way that you started. You know, by giving him money. Okay. That makes sense. But it won't be as fun. Since when is more money not fun? Okay, good point. To more money. To more money. How much are you gonna give him? I was thinking $1,000. That would give us $10,000. Yeah, okay. [female passenger] So how long have you been working for U-Lift? Uh, a little over a month now. You like it? It didn't start off too well, but lately it's been very rewarding. [passenger] That's good. What's up, buttercup? [laughs] Hey, it looks like this corner's getting pretty crowded. Probably my fault. I've been talking too much about the good luck I've been having on this corner. What's going on? Is there a convention in town? Oh, no, I'm just trying to do a good deed for someone less fortunate. Don't tell anyone about this. [Jeff] Hey, sorry for the detour back there. Maybe it was just a fender bender. Have a nice day. [passenger] You too. [Jeff] Oh, yeah, I definitely will. Can you meet me at the coffee shop now? [Sam] Sure, hon. On my way. Well? Jeff! [funky music] This seems really quick. Why? Look, if we just give him this money, we'll have $100,000. Yeah, good point. Hey, um, do you know where the other guy is? I don't know his name, but he usually stands on this corner. You got a better description? Um, well, he... Yeah, he's the guy with the funny signs. We all got signs. What, you don't think my sign is funny? Not bad. You're not gonna give me something? Sorry, man, you're not the right guy. Cheap bastard. [light music] [whirring] You lost your good luck charm. He's a person, Sam. Mm, a person. - Whose name you don't know. Nice. - [phone ringing] It's been less than a day. Okay, I saw him yesterday morning. - I'll find him, don't worry. - Mm. Yeah, well, you're not taking the 10 grand with you until you do. Okay. Let me just get a shower and some coffee, -[phone rings] and I'll get back out there. He's gotta be out there somewhere. Hey, Mom. What's wrong? Yeah, okay, sure, I'll meet you. But then I have to get out there and drive. Okay, U-Lift is my job, Mom, and it's a real job. I'll see you later. [sighing] Come, sit down. How's my boy doing? Mom, you know I don't like that stuff. Remember what I said? It's an acquired taste. You won't like it until you drink enough of it so your distaste for it goes away. - That doesn't make any sense. - Really? Think about the first time you drank a beer. So, what's the big 911? Oh, I just wanted to see you and see how you're doing. It's been so long. I'm sorry I don't call you more often. But I am thinking about you all the time. I just wanted to see you, see how you're doing. And you don't look too good right now. Well... everything was going fine until yesterday and then... You can tell me. It's a long story. [light music] And that's how I lost my lucky charm. I'm sorry you feel that way, but... I really don't think that's what happened. What do you mean? I... I can't find the guy. Well, I mean, I think it wasn't luck at all. I... I don't think you need that guy, though it was nice that you helped him. I actually think it was instant karma. I read about it the other day on the "inter web." It's fascinating. Have you heard of it? Instant karma is when you do good for anyone and something good immediately happens for you. That's what happened, I'm sure of it. All you need to do now is go back to work at your job and do good to anyone. Did you just say what I do for U-Lift is a job? I sure did, honey. I'm sorry about the other day. I also read about U-Lift on the "inter web" and now see it is a valuable part of our new gig economy. Mom, you're incredible. I don't care what anyone says about you. - What are people saying about me? - [laughs] Nothing. Nobody's talking about you, Mom. I have to get back to work, but thanks for the drink. It wasn't as bad as last time. See, what did I tell you? Just like a beer! [door closes] Mom, I can't talk right now. I have a passenger I have to pick up right here. I know, honey, it's me. I'm your passenger. How can I tell all my friends how much I love and support you if I don't support you? You're awesome, Mom. Hey, man. You look thirsty. Do you want something to drink? Uh, not really, no. I knew I should've gotten water. Just relax. The universe will bring you the right person at the perfect time. [Jeff] Are you thirsty? Yeah. Can I have that? You know what this stuff is, right? - Yeah, I've had that before. - All right. [laughs] Sorry, I don't have some food to give you too. Aw, thanks, man. But like my sign says, anything helps. [Mom] Wait a minute. Let's give him this. Wow. Wow! Thanks, man. You don't know how much this is gonna help. It's not a problem. Hey, what's your name, by the way? Charles. But my friends call me Chuck. All right, Chuck. It's nice to meet you. I'll see you around. Oh, thank you so much. God bless you, God bless you. That's it, we did our part. Now we just wait for it to come back to us. Thanks again, Mom. I'm sorry it didn't work out. I guess everything you read on the internet isn't always true. That's okay, Mom. It was just fun to hang out with you. [door closes] Where have you been all day? I was with my mom. Oh, great. Bet you didn't even try to look for your lucky charm. Correct. I told you not to waste your time with her. You know she doesn't even believe in you. Well, right now it seems like you're the one who doesn't believe in me. Well, can you blame me? It seems like you're pretty tired right now. Maybe you should just go to bed. Who are you to tell me what to do? You were failing at one thing and then another thing, and I'm the one that stood by you when no one in their right mind would have. You know, sometimes I wonder why I even did that. Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence. You stumbled upon the biggest lucky charm that I've ever heard of, and then right before we can hit it big, you blow it! You lose him, and now you're acting like it's not even a big deal! Hey, will you calm down? I know it's a big deal. And I'm sorry that I "lost the homeless guy." But did you ever think that maybe he wasn't the lucky charm that we thought he was? Of course he is. What are you talking about? How else do you explain all of the magical stuff that's been happening? What if it wasn't him? What if it was... instant karma? Did you ever think about that? Instant karma? What is that? My Mom told me about it today. She read about it online. It's the act of doing a good deed to anyone resulting in good coming back to you. Seriously? It's a real thing. I looked it up. So Mom and I drove around all day giving stuff to another homeless guy. Well? Did it work? No. Are you sure? Yeah, we checked everywhere in the car and... and didn't find anything. What about the hatchback? [light music] [trunk beeping] [male passenger] So how is your day going today? Oh, pretty good. I got in a big fight with my girlfriend last night, but we've already made up. Wow, that's impressive. What did you do? Well, I have to give her most of the credit. But I did make her pancakes. So that's your secret? Pancakes. Sorry to bother you, but... you look really familiar. Should I recognize you from somewhere? Well, maybe you've seen my photo in the post office on the wall there. - America's most wanted. - [chuckling] I don't think they do that anymore. But, seriously, where do I know you from? You got me. So, I'm the Mayor of Chandler. I knew it. I knew it! That's pretty cool. It must be a tough job. Everybody wanting something from you. [Mayor] That it is, my friend. That it is. Hey, before you go, can I give you something? Sure. A stick of gum? Should I take this personally? No, no, I'm just giving a small gift to all my riders today to celebrate me making up with my girlfriend. That's just what I grabbed from the bag, but you can take something else if you'd like. No, this is good. Maybe I do need it. Thanks. Hi there. Let me help you out. Oh, one second. Let me move this. [ethereal music] Sorry about that. Just right here. So, how's your day going so far? Who are you and where are you taking me? - Gotcha! - [laughing] Seriously, it's been a great day so far. We got two new residents and they're both men. Oh, so you're not married. Not currently. But check back with me in a week and I'll let ya know. [both laughing] So are you meeting some of your girlfriends for lunch? I'm meeting my boyfriend for happy hour! Wow. Well, he's a very lucky guy. This is for you. This is so beautiful. Thanks so much. And if things don't work out at lunch, I may have to call you later. [laughs] Have a good time. - Hey. - Hey. [both lightly moan] It is bigger and better than I had ever imagined. What? Babe! - Oh, my God. - Ah, ah. Let's go in the backyard, okay. I'll tell you all about it. - Okay? - [groans] [trunk beeping] Okay, so anytime you give anybody anything, it magically comes back to you ten times? Yep. Passengers, homeless people, random strangers on the sidewalk or in parking lots, anyone. But did it work with money too? I didn't have any on me, but I'm sure it will. Hopefully. But I think that we should try it before we go in for the big score again. Copy. Mm! I almost forgot. That guy Frank called and your car's ready. - Jeff, what is happening? How are you? - Frank. Life is great. Life is great? Wunderbar! You should put the "Life is Great" on a shirt. - There's an idea. - Yeah, let me show you your car. [tools whirring] I thought it was fixed. It is, but it's not what you thought. You thought your engine was blocked and locked up. It wasn't. You had plenty of engine oil. We had a simple fuel system cleaning. That took care of it. You're good to go. Wow. Thanks. But so you know, I don't know what any of that means that you just told me about my car. Except that... you could have ripped me off and charged me for a big repair that I didn't need, but instead... you looked out for me. - Thanks. - It's not about me. If I take care of you, I've got a business model. It's all about you. Let's get you checked out. Would you mind sitting in the back seat? [door closes] Let's go! Do you hear me? - We gotta hurry! - Yep. On our way. Should I ask why you're in such a hurry? I just knocked out my stupid boyfriend. And I stole his drugs. [chuckling] Well, that's something I don't hear every day. I wouldn't even know how to knock someone out. Well, it's easy when you got one of these. [chuckling] Wow. That's a big gun. Oh, damn! Something wrong? I forgot my damn ChapStick! Oh, um, I can help you with that. I... I think I have some in my bag here. - Hold on a second here. - [horn honks] Watch it! Are you trying to kill us? Yeah, sorry. Um... sorry. Here. Just take the bag. You can find it yourself. [sighing] - Did you find what you were looking for? - Yes. I can't live without my ChapStick. Glad you had the good stuff. So, what else you got up there? You got any money? Here, take whatever you want. Oh. All right, here we are. [kisses, blows] So, did you really pee your pants? Yeah, a little. Anyway... I have a coworker that also drives for U-Lift, and he tells me the craziest stories about passengers. Yeah, involving guns? No. Which means that this was probably just a one-off and won't happen again. Did you have any problems with your other passengers? Didn't have any. Just drove around for the rest of the day and jammed out. Can we just change the subject? Okay, do you know what you're gonna give next? Not really. - Do you think you'll wanna drive tomorrow? - Okay, stop, please. I feel like you're interrogating me. Let me just go get the stuff from the car. Can I help? [mouthing] Sam, we... we have a problem. What? What happened? I went to get the stuff out of the car, and I opened up the back, and it was empty. I gave that lady a whole bag of stuff and I didn't get anything in return. Shit. Am I losing the magic already? It's okay. There's gotta be some kind of explanation. Let's just talk it out. What happened differently with this passenger? Well, there were multiple items. But we did that with the homeless man, so. Can you think of anything else? Um, she was in the car when I gave her the stuff, but, well, we've done that before. So that's not it. Okay, relax. There's no pressure. I think I know what it is. I didn't actually give her anything. I thought you said she took, like, two bags of stuff. That's just it, she... she took it. I didn't give her anything. I put the bags in the back seat and said she could take whatever she wanted. I think that's it. Hey, I came as quick as I could. What's up? What is that? This all made sense at the time. Babe, I don't know what you're thinking unless you talk to me. Think about it. I was... shit out of luck. Every day my life was getting worse. Not counting you, of course. And then I met the homeless guy. I gave him $20 and I find $200 in the front seat of the car. And I get to keep it. Then I gave him lunch, and we scored all those big bags of groceries. So we're thinking he must be my lucky charm, right? Yeah, that makes sense to me. But then I lost him. Then Mom showed up. And she said that it wasn't him at all. It had nothing to do with him. She said it was instant karma. So we drove around the rest of that day and we gave drinks and money to a different homeless person. Turns out... it was instant karma. [Sam] Sounds good to me. Of course it does. Then I gave the mayor a pack of gum. I find ten packs of gum in the back seat of the car. I met that really nice old lady, gave her that beautiful scarf. And so on and so forth until the back seat of the car is filled with stuff. Ten times as much as I had given away. It was so fun. Until I gave that stuff to the crazy lady. No, she took that stuff. And I didn't get anything in return. Okay, so if it's not instant karma, then what is it? I think it must be your friend's car. Think about it. Before that showed up, I was on the worst string of bad luck. You were ready to leave me. And you probably should have if things didn't change. But they did change, big time... as soon as I started driving your friend's car. And then when I tried to do the same things while driving my car, it didn't work. I think you're right. But why would Kumar give me a magical car? [Jeff] I don't know. I think what we need to do first is test this out to see if I'm right. And then we need to make a plan on how to maximize using this while we have it. Yeah. So, did you go to church much when you were growing up? Yep. Sorry to hear that. What do you mean? Well, I've heard so many horror stories of people who were earnestly searching for God and got totally turned off. Some were even hurt or abused. Oh, none of that for me. I just lost interest in high school. I discovered girls. Well, that'll happen. And how about now? Um, you know, I guess I just try to live by the golden rule. "Do unto others" and all that. Like karma. Give to others and receive gifts in return. That's all good. "Give and you will be given to." Exactly. Hey, you know what, let me show you how it works. Hey, come here a second. Okay, you got a deal. Who's first? Uh, no, you have the wrong idea. You don't have to do anything. That's a gift. Thank you. I was a little nervous for a bit there, young man. [passenger] I was little worried about this. [rock music playing] [Jeff] Well, it's clear that you only reached out to me so that you could have someone to beat up on in tennis. Well, I always remember you being better than me in college, so. Okay, then either one of us hasn't played much since then, or one of us has played a lot. - Or maybe both. - [chuckles] Anyways, thank you for letting me beat up on you and being a good sport about it. Of course, man. This has been a lot of fun. I can't remember the last time that I had some guy time since I started dating Sam. Yeah, it's been a while for me also. It's great to catch up. You know, I never would have pegged you for a U-Lift driver. But it sounds like it's working out for you, so... that's cool. Yeah, and I'm really sorry to hear about your mom's cancer. Yeah, well, at least she's getting great care here at the clinic, so. That's all you can hope for. But I hear that's really expensive. How's her insurance? Let's just say it's not the best, but I'm working on a way to supplement it, so. I'm glad to hear. Well, this has been a lot of fun. The beer drinking part, not so much getting my ass kicked on the tennis court. But I gotta run. Let's get together again while you're in town. Yeah, definitely. And let me pay for the beers. It's only $1,000, but... I want you to have that to help your mom. - Dude, I can't take your money. - Don't worry about it. There's plenty more where that came from. And don't even worry about paying me back. [chuckles] You know that karma's spelled with a K, right? Yeah, but we have a magic car. - So I had it made with a C. - Oh. [laughs] I love you in pink, but this is really pink. Yeah, I know. It was the only color they had left. Maybe it'll fade if I wash it a couple times. [laughs] Wow, that shirt sure is pink! You get it at Goodwill? [laughs] First time I see you in a month and now you're a comedian? What can I say? I'm trying to expand on my comedic signage. Speaking of which... What if I could change things? For you and Jennifer Aniston? Are you serious? Tell me more. Not here. Can I get in? Where to? Thanks for bringing me here. I love this place. It's a beautiful stadium. Have you ever been to a game here? I wish. I never had the money. When I was a kid growing up in Chicago, my dad used to take me to Wrigley Field all the time. I even used to dream about playing for the Cubs. Can I ask you something that I should have asked you a long time ago? Harry. Harry Swayne. How'd you know I was gonna ask that? No one ever asks me my name. Well, like I said, I've been meaning to ask for a long time. Sorry, Harry. I'm also curious... Why did you disappear after the last time I gave you the money? You're not going to like it. Well, why not? You think I'll be upset that you... spent it on booze, drugs, and women? I wish. Never had the chance. What do you mean? One of the guys on the corner that day saw you give me the cash and told a few of his friends. I... I tried to downplay it and act like it was no big deal, but when I left, three guys followed me, jumped me, and... beat the shit outta me. And took all the money. And even worse, all my signs. Sons of bitches. Don't be mad at 'em. It's just how it is out here. And... anyways, I spent a few weeks in the hospital. Then they got me into a rehab center to recover. I'm just getting back to work this week. [Jeff chuckles] I'm glad you mentioned that. I've always been curious. How does that work? Do you have to clock in? - [chuckling] - Do you get to pick your corner or do you have like a supervisor who assigns those to you? You're funny. I should get your help with my new signs. Seriously, what if I could help you with your sign today? If you can get Jennifer Aniston to go out with me, sure, I'm down. Well, I don't know if I have that much money. But what if I did have enough to get you off the streets? At least for a little while. That'll work too. Okay. Fiesta Town Apartments. They're close by to here. I looked 'em up online and they seem okay. They have fully furnished apartments. You can get a six-month lease, and that should give you enough time to get back on your feet, find a job. And if you need anything else, you have my number. I'll even go to Goodwill with you. We'll get you some blankets, sheets, kitchen stuff. Whatever you need. Maybe we'll even find you a cool shirt like this. [chuckling] I don't know what to say, man. You don't have to say anything. I've been in your shoes before. Well, not homeless, but... I did hit a string of bad luck and someone helped me out. So I'm just paying it forward. Thanks, man. We'll have to come back here and go to a Cubs game next season. Deal. I look forward to it, Harry. - Just don't wear that shirt. - [chuckling] [engine starts] I just really don't like that the money's just in the car. It's fine. I parked right out front. No one's gonna take it. I don't know, I really think you should just either do the next giveaway or take it home or something. The next giveaway? - Already? - Sure. Why not? We're gonna be millionaires. Well, that's the plan. All right, how about this? I'll take the money home, hide it... but leave a little bit out so we can go on a spending spree. That way, if we get comfortable having money, maybe it won't feel as scary. Hmm. Yeah, I like that idea. I like that idea a lot.

I'm ready to go back out right now. No, we need to pace ourselves, okay? - [groans] Do we have to? - [laughs] Mm-hmm. [phone ringing] - Oh, sorry. - Who is that? Eh, it's Emilio. I should probably get this. Hey, man, what's up? Um, no... Okay. All right, man, I'll see you later. Okay. What was that all about? It's crazy, but it might be perfect too. He's in a real bind. But... how is that perfect? Well, I can help him. And by helping him, that could help us big time. Okay, so you're Mr. Riddle man now? No, sorry, let me explain. So, when I saw Emilio, he said that he had a plan to pay for his mom's medical bills. Okay. It turns out that the plan was to gamble and win the money. - Let me guess. - Exactly. He lost, big time. So what does he want? Well, that's the crazy part. He needs $100,000. Right away, tonight. Does he need $100,000 for his mom's medical bills or for like a gambling thing? Says he needs it right away. I'm assuming the latter, but I didn't ask. I just told him I'd help. He said he'd pay me back, but... I don't think he'll have to because of the magic. Wow, this is crazy but perfect. [chuckling] Mm! Clint? [trunk beeping] I'll take that for you, sir. Welcome aboard, Clint. How's your day been so far? It's been a long day. At least I didn't have to kill anyone, so. [laughs] Yeah, right, me neither. I'm kidding. You do a lot of these night shifts for U-Lift? Uh, not too many, but I like the variety, so I do them every now and then. You should be careful. Crazies come out at night. Yeah, I know you said that you've had a long day, but are you in a hurry now? That depends. Can you make it worth my while? [laughs] Probably not. I have a buddy who lives along the way and I have a bag that I need to drop off to him. Would you mind if we stopped on the way? Shouldn't be a problem. Thank you. You got it? Right here. The whole amount? Yeah, just like we talked about. Seriously, you have no idea how much this means. Listen, I'll... Listen, I'll pay you back every cent. Why'd you bring somebody, though? Don't you trust me? Yeah, of course I do. He's just my U-Lift rider. Don't worry about it. See, I told you that wouldn't take long. Easy peasy. In and out. Bada bing, bada boom. Should I ask what that was about? Please don't. I've got a U-Lift driver who's a spy. [chuckling] But seriously, I could use a guy like you. How'd you like to make some extra money? Um, no, thanks. Um, I'm good. I'll grab your bag for you, sir. For making my ride entertaining, kid. Hope to see you around. [door creaks] - Surprise! - Oh! Are you ready to celebrate? Well, don't you wanna see what we're celebrating first? [funky music] Sam... - We're millionaires. - [gasping] Oh, my gosh. We're millionaires.

I am so glad that we got the money last night. - We're freakin' millionaires! - [chuckling] Yeah! - [Jeff] Ugh, it's probably my mom again. - [phone rings] - What are you doing there? - Don't worry about it. I'm working. [phone ringing] [dings] Who called? I'm not sure. [over phone] Jeff, this is Clint. Yeah, you remember giving me a ride last night. You need to give me my bag back now or you're in deep shit! What's he talking about? I literally have no idea. He had one bag, I put it in the hatchback, and then I gave it back to him when I dropped him off. So you're positive that you did not switch that dude's bag with the giant bag of money you brought home? I mean, the bags looked similar, but, no, no, no. - There's no way that I switched 'em. - All right, Jeff, calm down. - Let's figure this out. - [phone ringing] Hello? [Clint] Did you get my message? - There must be some mistake. - That's right, and you made it. You put my bag in your car. It had a million dollars in it. And now, my money's gone. But I gave your bag back to you. Listen, you little shit! I'm not fucking around. - I didn't do anything. - Quit lying to me. You're really starting to piss me off. I know you have my money. I saw you looking at it on the security camera. Well... well, what if I don't have it? If you don't have it, then your little friend Emilio here is in for a world of hurt. And then I'm coming after you. I've got Emilio at a warehouse north of downtown. I'll text you the address. Come around back. Bring me my fucking money or you're both dead. You have two hours. Put Emilio on the phone first. - [stammers] If you want your money. - [Clint laughs] Playing hardball, are ya? If you want me to bring you your money, I need to know that Emilio's okay. [Emilio] Oh, Jeff, Jeff, you gotta help me. This guy's crazy. Please, please, Jeff, just... - [punch lands] - [Emilio grunts] [Clint] Better hurry. I don't think he'll last long. We've gotta get outta here. But we can't just leave Emilio. Did you hear that guy? Okay, before we do anything, we have to figure out why this is happening. Everything was going so well. Maybe we messed up the magic when we were cleaning the car? [ominous music] [crickets chirp] Ugh! [ominous music] Sam, where are you? I'm right here. What the hell? Just in case. - Have you lost your mind? - No! I'm being practical. That guy sounds like a total psycho. What's to stop him from killing us both after you give him the money? Okay, just stop for one second. You're right, Clint is a psycho, but we have to at least try to save Emilio. It's my fault he got sucked into this anyway. And first we have to figure out why all of this is happening. Do you recognize this? Yeah, it was in the car, next to the console. I took it out while we were cleaning. Do you have any idea what it is? No. [Jeff] It says that the statue is the God Shani. And Shani is the God of Karma. Yeah, and Shani is the most powerful of all gods and has the power to reward and to punish. So, this is the reason for everything. It wasn't Harry the homeless guy, or instant karma, or even the car. It was Shani, the God of Karma. [phone ringing] [Jeff] Maybe he got away. Emilio? [Clint] Emilio's a little under the weather right now. Clint, you better not have done anything to him. He has nothing to do with this. Okay, it was a mistake, a misunderstanding. I'm on my way right now to make things right. The clock is ticking. You have one hour left. - I have to go. - Let me come with you. No. I'm not letting you go by yourself. [ominous music] Should we bring the money? I think we should leave it here for now. - [ominous music] - [garage door creaks] Emilio! [ominous music] [Clint] Well, well, well. Hello, Jeff. You son of a bitch. Why are you doing this? He didn't do anything! You're right. But you know what? He had to pay 10% interest on your loan. Which he was unwilling to do until I applied a little pressure. What the hell is wrong with you? Jeff, you stole my fucking money! [gasping] Hey, who's your little friend there? You leave her out of this. Then why the fuck did you bring her? You know what? Don't answer that. Glad she's here. [Sam] Oh, no! - No! - [grunting] What are you gonna do to us? [Clint] Well, it depends. Did you bring my money? - Oh... - [Jeff] No. No? No, we didn't bring the money. We hid it. So if you kill us... you'll never find it. - [Emilio grunts] - [Sam] No, no! [Jeff] Listen! We'll trade you the money. For our lives. All three of us. So you give me my money and I let you go. Is that right? No. You let us go, and then I'll bring you the money. [Clint laughing] Do you think I'm stupid? [Jeff] No, I don't. But I can clearly see that you're a tough guy, so I'm appealing to your sense of fair play. Just give us a chance. I promise, if you let us go, I will promise that you get your money. Fair play? You want me to trust you after you stole my money? [laughs] Okay, sure. Tell you what I'll do. On one piece of paper I'll write "Let you go." And on the other... "Kill you." And you pick which piece of paper. That way, you decide what I do to you. Now choose one. Untie me first. Okay, but no funny business. [snaps fingers] All right, you... But you have to promise to be a man of your word. If I choose the one that says "Let you go," you have to let us go. Oh, Jeff, I cross my heart and hope to die. What are you doing? You said that you wrote "Kill you" and "Let you go" on the papers, right? Well, let's see which one's left... and we'll know what I chose. You little shit! It looks like I chose the one that said "Let you go," so you have to let us go. [Clint] I'm not letting you go! - Don't let them get away! - [muffled shouting] [Clint] I'll be back for you later. [engine starts] [tires screech] Go, go, go, go! [dramatic music] - [Jeff] You see 'em? - Yes, I see them! - They're still there. - Shit. [tires squeal] [Clint] Keep close. Step on it. - Can we go any faster? - I'm trying! I... Let's go, catch up. - You're driving like your mom! - Oh, my God. - I'll go up there. - Take it. Take it, take it! I don't even know where this goes. - [Sam] No, no, no, no. - [Jeff] Shit. Uh... - It's okay, just turn around. - Yeah. [Jeff] Oh, my God, I think we lost 'em. [Sam] Where are they? Oh, shit! Oh, my God! What do we do? - What do we do? What do we do? - Sam, run! [Sam grunts] Come on. [gunshots] There's nowhere left to go. That was a good one back there... Eating the fucking paper. I didn't see that coming. But now your time is up. If you both come out with your hands up, I might let one of you go. Okay. Coming out. [Jeff] Don't shoot. - [grunts] - Oh! Where's my money? [cocking gun] -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Jeff, if we just... we just tell him where it is, it'll be... it'll be... He's gonna let us go, right? - Right? - Okay. [groaning] Okay. Okay, I'll... - I'll tell you where it is. - Where is it? [groans] It's in the car. Let's go! Show me! - It's in the back of the car. - I said let's go! [groaning] Here. That wasn't so hard. - [engine starting] - [car door closes] [brakes squeak] Can you pop the trunk, please? [trunk beeping] You okay with this, sir? [businessman] Yeah, it should be fun. [trunk beeping] First ride share, huh? Yes, sir. What kind of work do you do? I used to sell books online. Now I sell just about everything. I've probably bought something from you... before. Let me help you with your bag, sir. [light music] Here you are, sir. [businessman] Thank you. - [Jeff] What about this one? - [businessman] It's not mine. [dramatic music] [ethereal music]
