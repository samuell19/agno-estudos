How are you, little sweetheart? Hello, Mrs. Hughes. How are you feeling today? Hello, Buddy. How are you? I'm fine, fine. That's all I have. That isn't half enough. Aw, gee whiz, Ma. Gee whiz, nothing. Young lady, if you haven't got it, you've got to get it. - My feet are all... - Gloria. Gloria. Here, I can spare this $5 until you get paid. Aw, Buddy, you're a dear, sweet boy. Thanks so much. - Goodbye, Buddy. - Goodbye, Mrs. Hughes. See you at home, Gloria. I don't know how she does it, but Mom certainly can smell money. Thanks, Buddy. I'll pay you back Saturday. That's all right, Gloria. Remember what I always fold ya... you can have anything I've got. Of course, I haven't got anything, but... you can have all of it. Thanks. Oh, Buddy... You remember the dreams I used to have about the Follies? Yeah. Well... I guess they were only dreams. Why don't you try to get in again? I've been thrown out of there too many times now. The only way they'd let me stay inside is to have the joint quarantined. -The first time was all right— -Maybe you're right about that, kid. - No more for me. - Gee, that's tough luck. Lookie, kids. We're gonna have another outing! - That's swell! When is it? Gee! - Great! Come on, dear. Let's sneak away on the lake, shall we? Yeah, come on. Your beautiful tribute has brought the tears to my eyes. On this occasion... the 41st anniversary... of Heimer's, of which I have the honor of being your president... ...of ten years... of service, loyalty and cooperation. With our proud duty to our community... with the noble heritage of our past, with the glorious promise of our future, thrilling to that duty of service and loyalty, one for all, and all for one! One big, happy family. We stand hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder, and back-to-back in this great fight! But let us always remember the customer is always right! But right or wrong, our country needs us! Gosh, Gloria, isn't this better than sitting there, singing our heads off to that old pretzel? Mm-hmm. Gee, I don't know. When you're close to me like this, you... You just burn me up. I guess that's the same kind of funny feeling I get, Buddy. Yoo-hoo! Buddy! -If we could only be like this, always. Hmm. - In a canoe? - Anywhere. A little flat. And I'd come home to you every night. - And you'd be waiting there... - On, [ would, would 1? Any old time I stay at home all day, waiting for a man... Yeah, but lots of girls do, dear. Now, Buddy. You've been reading your fairy tales again. And the little princess waited for her little Prince Charming. No, darling. Not for little Gloria. I want to go places and do things before I settle down and raise a lot of little passengers for the subway. Oh, Buddy. Let's sing your new song. How does it go? -I When luck defies you I -Wait, wait, I know. 2 When luck defies you & Yoo-hoo! Buddy! 1 Just look around And 1 be there § 'When you go falling & &' Don't waste your time In calling 7 1 Just look around And 1 be there § - “What's that? - Oh, just the band. What do we care?

I bet ya. - Well, smarty, you lost. - Know it. - I owe you a nickel. - Buddy! Come on, some speed. Ladies and gentlemen! The first act on the bill will be Miller and Mooney... dancing team. Come here. Say, I like you. Who are you, anyway? I am woman, one of nature's loveliest pieces of architecture. Oh, yeah? Gee, that's great. I'm a building inspector. Some gal. - Say, do you know what I call my girl? - No, what do you call your girl? I call my girl Grapefruit. Why do you call your girl Grapefruit? "Cause every time I squeeze her, she hits me in the eye." You're so funny. Hey, watch your feet, you big ham. Ah, button up your face, your nose is out too far. 7 Little girl No wonder you're so happy & I Little boy No wonder you're so gay J I Let me take you strolling In the moonlight 2 Oh, I know at jolly game That we can play! 4 Billing and cooing While we go canoeing & & Around a little sea we go I Hugging, kissing Oh, you don't know what you're missing & As you watch The rippling waters flow 7 Laughing, singing To each other clinging & 2 With the moon That's softly shining up above 7 Kiss her once or twice Gee, boys, now, ain't it nice?

Hey, bozo, I always finish with you, don't I? As far as I'm concerned, you're finished to a T. That finish routine makes a big hit with me. Well, I got along a darn fine better before I married you. Yes, you got along before you married me, swishing your tail in burlesque. Listen, Belle, ( was only kidding you. You didn't take me seriously, did you, kid? Say, I didn't mean that. Forgive me this time, will ya? Just this time, honey. Gloria, why don't you try that cute little dance you used to do? - Oh, na. - Come on. We gotta go on. Yeah, we do. Attagirl, Gloria. Come on, Gloria. Come on! Say there, kid. You're some cute dancer. Thanks. I can do much better than that, but I haven't practiced for years. With a little practice, I think you'd be able to make the grade in the big time. You really think so? I should say so. Where can I get in touch with you? Say... Oh, don't worry, buddy. Strictly business. Well, I... I'm Gloria Hughes. And I work in the song department at Helmer's. Say, I'd like to look you up. You mind if I show you some of my new dance steps? No, I'd love it. - Okay with you, sonny? - My name isn't sonny. Say, I didn't ask you to climb up on my knee. It's Buddy. Okay, Buddy. Time step. I can't get that first part right, where it starts... 2 When... & I think it's great just that way. Yeah? What do you know about it? Well, I know the things that I like. And one of them is your song. - Geez, it's the boss. - Go on, Buddy. That's swell. Geez, it's the boss. What's the idea? Nobody's singing here? Where's Gloria? Why, she had a bad toothache and had to go to the doctor's. I mean, the dentist. Oh, Barbara. -Yes, sir. “Where's Gloria today? Uh... Her grandmother died this morning. She had to go to the funeral this afternoon. Well, she can go to her own funeral now. I'm sick of these girls walking in and out of this place as they please. And when she comes in, tell her not to hang around for a check. We'll mail it to her. Gee, Buddy, did you hear what he said? I was afraid this was gonna happen to Gloria. I knew she was spending too much time with that Miller guy. Lackawanna-6100. Sheet music. Hello, Buddy? Hey, Buddy, brace yourself. I've got some great news for you. We've just been booked for 20 weeks. - Gee, Barbara, they made it! - Oh, great! But this is the greatest news of all. We leave tonight at 8:00 for the West. Yeah. Yes! Gee, Buddy. Aren't you happy? And you're the first person I've fold. I've got to run and pack now, dear. Hurry over as soon as you can. I'll be there. Goodbye. Golly, that's wonderful. Yeah. Wonderful. Sections 5 and 7 on the Chicago. Better hurry. Only got a minute. He isn't here. Something must have happened. Come on, Gloria. We've only got a minute. Board! Barbara. Pay for this, will you, please? Oh, Buddy! Damn it. You better get that piano player out of your mind. He never did anything for you. What of it? Now, Gloria. For instance, take Mr. Miller. He's—- Yeah. You take him. Well, if it wasn't for him, you'd still be yelling your head off at Heimer's. Am I any better off now? Eating a lot of greasy food, one cheap hotel after another, playing five a day. - “Well, you make a lot of money. - Yeah, a lot of it [ get. Well, of course, you'd only spend it foolishly. - I'm saving it for you. - Yeah, I know. A lot of thanks I get after all I've done for you. Didn't I raise you and slave for you? And worked my fingers to the bone. Yeah, I know that old story too. Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. I appreciate everything you've done for me. I'll try my best to forget Buddy. Oh, Gloria, darling. You always were a good, good girl. I've got to go to the drugstore before it closes. Hurry now, dear. You only have a few minutes. Good evening, Mr. Miller. Oh, hello, Mrs. Hughes. I'm on my way 10 the drugstore. Can I get you some more corn plasters? No, thanks, Mother. I've got enough to last me another thousand miles. That old dame gets in my hair. 2 When you forget to remember & It's a wonder you wouldn't knock. Aha. It is often said a boost is better than a nap. Well, smarty, you can just boost yourself right out of here. Now, now, gorgeous. Don't get violent. - Please, I'm in a hurry. - Just look at those pretty lips. How about a little kiss? How about a little bite instead? Come on. Cut out the wisecracking, will ya? I like you a whole lot. Well, let it end there. But I can't, baby. I'm just nuts about you. Gee, every time I lock at you, I just go daffy. - Please. I'm in a hurry. - Gloria, I'm crazy about you. Don't do that. I'll make you like my kisses, you little devil. Now, you get out of here, and get out quick, before I start throwing things. Let me tell you something, baby. I can get another Mooney for this act overnight. And if you're gonna get fresh with me, you'll find yourself back in the alley where I found you. Hey, gorgeous. Come here. Oh, how do you de? You're Mr. Miller, aren't you? You said it, baby. I'd like to have a little talk with you. Won't you come into my office? You know, baby, I got a load of you from the wings yesterday. And I think you're plenty hat. Oh, Mr. Miller. While I was watching your routine work, I got an idea. How'd you like to get out of that line and team up with a real act? Oh, Mr. Miller! You know, Mooney and I don't hit it off so well together. Besides being slow on her feet, she's got a bad disposition. And I thought maybe you'd like to take her place. Oh, Mr. Miller! Say, I've got an idea. How would you like to come up to my place after the show and we'll talk this thing over. You never can tell around here. There are too many big ears. Well? What do you say? How about a little kiss to seal the bargain? What's the matter? Did you and Miller have a fight? I just heard him talking to another girl about taking your place. - When? - She's in there now. You must have done something to make him mad. What was it? Oh, that dirty bum sneaked in here and started one of his mauling scenes. I got a little sore and I told him where to get off at. I knew I shouldn't leave you alone. Every time I do, you mess things up. What are we gonna do if he kicks you out? I'm sorry, Ma, but that's not part of our act. Miller and Mooney on next. - All right. - Hook me up quick, will you? Hello, hello. Mr. Miler, you're on. Yes? How am I doing? Well, we have just about enough money to get us back to New York. And if you ever open your mouth again, I'll put my foot in it. All right. I'm sorry, Mr. Miller. I didn't mean that. That's the last time you're gonna bum me up and knock me cold. I was only joking. All I want you to do is go on and do the act. Is this the act you want to see, Mr. Sharpe? That's the new Mooney. I wonder how they're hooked up. I don't suppose they're hooked up at all. I understand he has a new Mooney every few weeks. & Don't think your work is over At close of day J 2 When night comes "round You mustn't stop to rest &" J Put on your patent leathers And make your way 2 To where your feet Must take their dancing turn & 4" Heels burning up, toes turning up Sparks flying around J 2 When you get those old hot feet To heat up the ground » I Shoes popping and knees flopping There's no stopping your feet I 2 And a big asbestos seat Is all that you need & J Put your old hot feet That beat the beat on the ground 2 How do you like the act? All right. Let's go back and see them. Oh, Mr. Miller. I'm sorry about Gloria. But I'm sure I can fix everything. - Oh, you can, can you? - Yes. Well, there's nothing to fix. Hey, Danny. Danny. Did you know Sharpe was outside? - You mean Stanley Sharpe, from Ziegfeld? - Yeah. Old boy Stanley, en? I guess Ziggy sent him on to get me to sign for next season. He thinks because I'm playing this town, he can get me for coffee and cake money. Well, he'll lay it on the line too, baby. “This is Miller speaking.” Oht Hello, Mr. Sharpe. I'm Miller. You know, Miller of Miller and Mooney. - Yeah, I just caught you. - Oh, yeah? How'd you like it, eh? Pretty good, huh? Yeah. By the way, how about Mooney? Oh, money? We can get together on that, all right, Mr. Sharpe. How are you hooked up? You know. I manage to put away a little something every week... No, old man, you got me wrong. I mean the girl, Mooney, your partner. Oh, I see. You mean... We're hooked up all right. You know, partners. Of course, the kid's a little new yet, but... I think with a little more work, I'll make her pan out all right. Where is the girl? I'd like to have a chat with her. She had to duck right after the performance, Mr. Sharpe. Dancing for one of those big parties. Didn't even have time to change her costume. Too bad. I'd like to have seen her. Oh, I'll tell her you called. I'll bring her around to see you, Mr. Sharpe. I suppose you're at the Blackstone. No trouble. I'll get in touch with her later. Oh, no trouble, Mr. Sharpe. Say, I'm tickled to death to do it for Ziegfeld. Well, all right. You were right, Danny. Make him put it on the dotted line. Let him know it's Miller speaking. That was just Sharpe's way of trying to beat me down. Before I'd let him touch me, I'll go back to Heimer's. I guess that's where you'll have to go now. And the act was going so grand. I know it. You won't get applause like that down at Heimer's. Aw, gee, Ma. I'm sorry. I thought I told you to knock when you came in here! Gloria! Now, Gloria, why do you always pick on me? Mr. Miller, you don't understand Gloria. She was only playing with you, not picking on you. “Weren't you, Gloria? Uh-huh, Well, I'm certainly glad to hear that. For a while, she had me fooled. You know, Mrs. Hughes, Gloria and I just had a little spat. Oh, Mr. Miller, that isn't anything. Everybody has a spat now and then. Well, here's what I was thinking of, Mrs. Hughes. In order to protect Gloria in the future, in case these little spats should occur again, I was thinking we ought to have an agreement. You know, a partnership. Oh, Mr. Miller. I just think that's lovely of you to have Gloria's interest at heart. And I certainly think a contract would be fine for both of you. Don't you think so, Gloria? Yes. But why the sudden change? A little while ago, you wanted to kick me out on my ear. Aw, gee whiz, Gloria. Couldn't you see I was only fooling? Yeah, I knew it all the time. But I don't want to sign any agreement. Oh, Gloria. Don't you see that Mr. Miller's just doing it for your good? Well, if Gloria feels that way about if, I wouldn't want her to sign. Mr. Miller, just a minute, please. I knew it. After the way I've worked for you and slaved for you, what do you do? You never think of your poor mother. Al right, Ma. I sign. You know, Gloria, after all, it's you I'm thinking of. I worked dam hard teaching you my routines. All right. If its going to be a partnership, we'll make everything 50-50. -50-507 -50-50. Oh, Gloria. I work just as hard as you do, and I want half of everything. - Nothing doing. - No contract. Oh, well... What's the difference? That's okay. Well, here's the game. “It is mutually agreed... that we are equal partners in the team of Miller and Mooney... and will split all earnings... biting... et cetera... 50-50... for a period of five years'... - Five years? - Why, of course, Gloria! Certainly. All right. “...from the above date.” Porter! Hey, Buddy. I can't see a thing. Can you see her? No, I can't. Gloria! Gloria! You look like a big star. No, I don't. I had a marvelous trip. Damn it. Gloria! I say, Gloria! Oh, I might have known something like this would have happened. Ain't it awful? It just makes me sick. Mo, it's lousy. Let's ankle out of here. All right. Stage door, New Amsterdam Theater. 43rd Street. Buddy! Buddy! Buddy! Get an ambulance! Quick! Get her back! How annoying! I suppose some hayseed thought he was back on the farm. I guess you're right, Mother. All right, boys. Come here. What do you say? Double or nothing for the tip. - Tails. - Heads. You lose. Boy, New Amsterdam Theater. Stage door. Gee, I wish you didn't have to go to rehearsal and we could be alone tonight. Yes, dear. It would be nice to be alone. But this is much more important. Yeah, if that's what you think. Why, Buddy! This is my big chance. I know it, dear. Gee, Buddy. Just think. Wouldn't it be great to have my name in lights? Yes. It'd be great. What's happened, Gloria? You seem different. Oh, Buddy. Don't be silly. Remember the dreams we used to have about the stage when we were kids? You remember how Mike used to throw Barbara and us out of the New Amsterdam? I should say I do. {bell ringing] Those things make cold shivers run up my back. Yeah, they give me the creeps, too. Where were we? Oh, we were talking about Barbara. Can you imagine us running off and leaving her? Why? What do you mean? - Was she down there to meet me? - Yeah. Oh, Buddy. I guess she'll get home all right. - Got that end all right? - Okay. - Oh, Buddy, doesn't this look familiar? -'ll say so. -Isn't that Mike? I think so. Sure, it's Mike. You don't remember us, do you? You used to throw us out of here when we were kids. And I'll throw you cut again. You will not! I'm Gloria Hughes! - Little Gloria Hughes? - Yes! But now I'm Mooney, of Miller and Mooney. I knew you'd make good. You were always a fresh little egg. Well, I guess you'll be seeing a lot of us now. Oh, boy, I'm scared stiff. Come on. You'll be all right. Hold it What's the matter with you girls? Are you afflicted with housemaid's knee? Raise your legs on that kick. You work like a lot of rheumatics. - All right, come on. We'll try it again. - Gloria. What do you mean by running away and leaving me? Oh, Mother. I was so excited. I couldn't wait for you! Hello, Mrs. Hughes. How are you? Oh, it's Buddy! I suppose you're still down at Heimer's store. - Yes, I am. - I thought so. Say, Dad... Who's the old gray-haired guy out there? That's Pop Morgan, the director. Oh. Hold it. Girls, girls, what is the matter with you today? Why, you're positively stupid! Why don't you listen to me? (All right. We'll do it again. So I says to this guy, “Nerts,” I says. - Oh, you didn't. - Didn't, huh? He can't get away with that stuff with me. My God, my feet are killing me. Come on, girls. Pep it up, come on. 0Oh, lay an egg, you old coot. That's one director you can call what you damn please. He's as deaf as a post. But, boy, how he can read lips. He keeps his ears glued to the piano. Getting vibrations, or something, the old coot. Come on, come on. You're like a lot of old washerwomen. Blow it in your hatch, you old, white-headed rooster. Step out of that line. I saw what you called me. I didn't call you anything. Really, Mr. Morgan. I just said I was one of your greatest boosters. Boost yourself to your room. I'm not gonna stick around here all day. I think I'll tell that bird who I am. Yes. Go ahead. A little pep now, girls. Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey! “Who are you "heying"? This is a team going into the show. A theme? What theme? No, a team. Miller and Mooney. I'm Miller. You know, Miller, of Miller and Mooney. You're a team, huh? Where's the rest of ya? - Here I am. Hello, Mr. Sharpe. - Hello, Miss Mooney. This is Mr. Morgan, the director. Mr. Morgan, this is Miller and Mooney. How do you do? Say, do you want us to do our stuff for ya? Well, you certainly can't dance with those clothes. -Get 'em off. “Where can I change? Anywhere on the stage. Over there, anywhere. Oh, Buddy, will you please bring me my bag? All right, girls. Give me the exit step. I'm all set the way I am. Put it there, Buddy. Open it quickly, will you? Listen, Mike. Tell that laundryman to be careful of the laundry. He lost two of my Pullman towels last week. Oh-ho, that's a good one! Gloria. I was thinking, if you get a chance, would... Would you mind talking to him about my song? - Your song? - Yeah. Gee, Buddy, give me a chance 10 get myself set first, will you? Well, you needn't get sore about it. All right, Charlie, here's the first number, “Hot Feet.” Play an 8-bar introduction and two chords. - And don't forget the 8-bar tag. - Yes. And build up the finish, will ya? - Okay, okay. - Make it good and hot. Nice and peppy. Let's go. All right, that'll do. I can imagine the rest. Come on, girls. Let's have that last chorus. Wait a minute. Say... Ain't you gonna give me a chance to show you my single? I don't want to see your single. - I'll knock "em dead!" - All right, Joe. Hit it. I'll knock 'em dead, I tell ya! I'll knock "em dead!" I'll knock you dead if you don't stop veiling at me. What's the matter, Mr. Sharpe? I'm sorry, but if Pop Morgan doesn't like you, that's all. But we signed a contract with you, Mr. Sharpe. You've got to stand behind us. I know, Miss Mooney. But it can't be helped. Listen, Mr. Morgan. I'm not trying to tell you how to run your show, but we came here to show our stuff, and I want a chance to do it. Well, just what can you do? Well, I can do anything. I can dance that chorus. Or any chorus. All right, let's see it. Will you please take that mat up? Boys, pick up this mat. I've got to dance now. I've waited all my life for this opportunity and I'm not gonna let it get away from me. Gee, are you ready for the other one? Come on now, hurry. Don't rush me. Remember, Gloria. I'll be plugging for you. Yes, Buddy, I know. - Are you all right now? - Oh... Would you please play a waltz? Why, I'd even “play house” for you. Well, what do you think? -See? I told you all along she was great. Quiet! She'll hear you. That guy knows as much about dancing as I know about building a bridge. Mother! I made it! Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey. Oh, Danny, I'm awfully sorry. So that's Miller and Mooney. Hmm! They can't kid me. That's Mama and Papa. Really too bad, Mr. Miller. And after all you've done for Gloria. Say, don't worry about me. I'm not worried. Remember, we're still partners. Still partners? Certainly. Don't you remember that little agreement? For five years? Five years? Mm-hmm. And we split everything 50-50. -50-50? Mm-hmm. You know, that was your idea, Gloria. And I, being big-hearted, agreed. Now all I have to worry about is your future. Now you see the mess we're in? Well, I guess it's all my fault. Buddy! Aren't you going to congratulate me? Of course I do. Why, Buddy! What's the matter? Nothing. Oh, you'll be busy, and I guess I'll go along. No, don't go. Yes, I... I think I'd better. Goodbye, Gloria. Good evening, Buddy. I've been trying to get you for hours. And then [ guess I dozed off and the piano woke me up. I'm awfully sorry, Miss Schultz. I didn't realize it was so late. Oh, t'ain't that. But I've got some bad news for you. - Bad news? - Barbara is seriously hurt. She's in the emergency ward at Bellevue Hospital. What? And she's calling for you. I guess you'd better rush right on over. Oh, telephone the New Amsterdam Theater and tell Miss Hughes about it. Miss Hughes? All right, son, I'll phone. Buddy... Buddy... You... wait for me, Buddy. Why are you always running away from me? I'll never run away again, dear. Oh, I was afraid you wouldn't get here. It'll be all right. I only got word a minute ago. Don't leave me. You'll never leave me again, will you, Buddy? No, dear. Never. How do you do, ladies and gentlemen, this is Norman Brokenshire with the Columbia Broadcasting System.

Well, how do you like that? Let me tell you something. When you're wearing a suit like that, you will be the talk of the town, I'm telling you. You could go to a baseball game, and you'd stand up and holler, “Hooray for Babe Ruthie! Knack a home run!” And the people would say, “Who is that fresh man?” They'd see you and say, 'He's not fresh, he's wearing a Copenheimer coat.” You see what I mean? You go to a dance at night. You come up to a woman and say, “Pardon me, could I have the next waltz with you, if you please?” And she says, “He's too short. Ah, but he's a Copenheimer.” So if you wear a Copenheimer, you can"t go wrong. I'll tell you something. In Washington, in the inauguration, what do you think Coolidge is saying to Hoover?

You wouldn't get out of here without a suit, that you know. That you know, don't you? -You want to save $107 -Yes. Walk upstairs. Come along. That's all you've got to do. We're here to please you. We want to take care of you.
