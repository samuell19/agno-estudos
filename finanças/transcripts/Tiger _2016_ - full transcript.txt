Ripped by gdhaliwal23 You gave me river to ease, and I divided water as I pleased. I drew boundaries and planted flags to tease. No matter how proud a man feels of his flags or his ways or his deeds but these boundaries are futile in stoping the wind, water or birds. When a boundary was drawn on the map in 1947 Jangpura and Mukampura, two neighboring villages each became a part of a different country. One in India while the other in Pakistan. This made the drug business bloom into a big black market. And this business lured a few innocent ones in a very tempting way and in order to fly freely, they soared so high that they forgot their way back. One of them was Jant. Also, his best friend, Bittu. And their buddy, Tull. These little birds, who are addicted to soaring, would get sweet poison from across the border in their bags. And the one to distribute this sweet poison to people was Bhaiya. His aim: Money. His target: Punjab. Jangpura. There are around 500 houses in this village. Out of these, 490 houses have an F.I.R. lodged against them. And these F.I.R.s aren't for pride, honor or love, but these F.I.R.s are for smuggling drugs. This village, where people smuggle alcohol in the tubes of their car tires, turned into a kingdom worth millions in a single day, smuggling drugs. And the king of this kingdom is Dilbagh. The law and government never take any action against them because they get a big share of this treasure as well. And the addicts of this petty death knock at their doors, first thing in the morning. The species that was known for pride, manliness, and conscience, is seen meeting its end here. Now, only God can protect Punjab. They have beautiful actresses whereas we just have sand and crows. We too have a few. Make do with them. Well said, sir. Let's go. Come on. Sir, look, someone is crossing the L.O.C. Stop! Stop, or I will shoot you! -Stop! -Stop! Didn't you hear me? Stop! Sir, why didn't you let me shoot him? Let them go. They are taking the poison of our country to their country. We do the same too. -Come on, give me a cigarette. -Absolutely, sir. Tull, go that way. Bittu, you go there. When I see the dim light In the backyard When I see the dim light In the backyard When I see the dim light In the backyard That's when I say... Do you have something for me? Nothing can be done so soon. Sir, lunch... Bring it here. ...in the backyard! When I see the dim light... Goodbye. Help! Anyone there? Someone, help me! I don't want to wear a cop's uniform! Help! Someone, help me! Garbage in the gutter and the young of a snake can never be trusted. There are a few laws of nature, sir. And if a person forgets these laws he must pay the price for it. I made a mistake. I was drunk, so I didn't realize it. Let me go. I am letting you go, jailor... But you don't deserve to be forgiven. Get lost from here. You made a big mistake by letting me go. I will not spare you next time. Hit him. Hit his ankles. Teach him a fine lesson. You... You are very brave, aren't you? That you dared to mess with a tiger like me! I keep tigers like you in my pockets, Officer. Hit him! -Hit him! -Hit him! -Break his bones! -Hit his knees! Hit him! Hit him harder! Hit him! Stop. What happened, Jailor? Are you tired already? But I am still not tired. -How are you, Manjeet Singh? -Great. -Everything fine? -Tell me how you are doing. -How are you, Karam Singh? -Good. -All right? -Yes. -How are you, Sukhraj? -Good. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind. -How are you, Harjeet? -Good. -Here's your parcel. -Thank you. Hello, Mr. Shah. Is the new batch here? Sit. Mr. Shah... Don't you think that's a little less than usual, Mr. Shah? If you make too much noise, then I can take back -what I have already given. -But, Mr. Shah... You are a cop, behave like one. Don't try to become me. Mr. Shah, I wanted to talk about something. -Tell me. -Himmat can be released. I know someone. He is very smart. Just by looking at the mud on a bird's feet he can tell where they are from. If you allow, shall I talk to him? Why is he chained and shackled? Mr. Shah, a wild animal like this should be kept shackled. -Release him. -But, Mr. Shah... You could become a cop only because of me. Release him. Do it! I don't drink tea. Tota told me a lot about you. I trust him and that's why I called you here. The job is a little difficult. With the help from a ray of light coming through the window of my prison cell, I have read the books of law. And I grew up sleeping on a stone block. I know very well the importance of freedom. If you do my job... I always pay my debts. Send me Himmat's file. -How are you, sir? -Where is my stuff? First, clear the previous dues. Don't fly too high just because you have Balkar's support. You might fall hard. Don't forget that I have a great connection with the jailor here. I am a businessman. I don't play for both teams like you. Get lost. Okay, then. Let me see how strong you are today. Lawyer! Lawyer! You should show your valor on a battlefield. If you get killed in a prison then you will have no one shedding tears for you. And by the time the news of your death reaches your village it will become old news. One more thing... From now on, never touch my friend again. Okay, then. Consider this to be a battlefield. A middleman must do only what he is supposed to do. He should not try to act all brave and try to be the boss. Move aside. Mr. Shah... Himmat got released. -Are you sure? -Absolutely, Mr. Shah. Tota, your lawyer is a very useful man. -Call him here. -He cannot come here, Mr. Shah. The jailer has shackled him. How dare he! In spite of me telling him not to... You said that he hit the jailer. Mr. Shah, the jailer gave it back to him. Scoundrel, he just fixed me. Nonsense! Himmat, whom you helped release... He is my son. You've been rotting here for15 years, why don't you get out of here, too? Not a case or a lawyer... No appeals or arguments... These are such terrible times, Mr. Balkar, that honest people need only recommendations. Mark my words... I will get you out of here in one month. Have you heard of the place, Jangpura? Prepare to get out of here. If you need anything when you're in Jangpura, then meet him. You are very smart, lawyer. You didn't only bail Himmat out, but yourself as well. I hope you don't forget me after you get out of here. You have done me a huge favor. You should come with me. I don't have any goal to fulfil out there. You will also be doing the same thing after leaving here. You will see a new me once I get out of here. And if I call you there for a goal, will you come? Try me! I will come flying. Jai Hind. Yes? What is it that you need? -Who are you? -You tell me who you are! This house... Is there a kabaddi match going on inside that you want to go in? You need to seek permission at the restaurant to go inside. -Which restaurant? -The one in the market. -Bhaiya's restaurant? -No, a foreigner's restaurant. They think they can just walk in here. Here, son. Isn't it tasty? How proudly I used to say that I would be at ease only after eradicating the drug business from my village. But I was also fated to see such days. People stop me on the way and say... "Comrade, explain to your son. He supplies drugs for Bhaiya and Dilbagh." He has ruined my reputation in this village. He was my tiger. I used to address him as Tiger. I'd rather be childless than have such a son. Tell him that after I die, I don't want him to perform my final rites. Bittu, I thought you must have settled down well by now. Jant, after you got arrested, I decided not to risk my life anymore. I should just make enough to feed my family. There's a government job I could get. I will retire after 26 years. I will get some money as well. I am happy with what little I have. And where is that fatso, Tull, these days? -I haven't seen him. -Tull? After that incident, his father took him to Jammu. I don't know what happened after that. Do you have any information about my family? What do you mean? Two days after you got arrested, your father was changing the fuse of the transformer. He got electrocuted. He fell from the tower as if he was a new electrician. What about my mother and my sister? Both of them are fine. Mom! Gurjant? People said that you were dead. And what did your heart say, Mom? My child... My dear son... Where have you been, leaving your mother behind? I waited for you for so many years. Now, I'll never leave you alone. Your son is back, Mom. I see, you have a nice beard now. -You look handsome. -I missed you a lot, Mom. Let's go. You must be tired. Take a bath. Neeru! Neeru, where are you? Look, your brother is back. Our Jant is back. My brother is back, everyone! My brother is back! My brother has come back, everyone. My brother is back. You used to say that my father's family has fallen apart, right? You used to say that our family has fallen apart! It has not fallen apart. My brother is back. My brother has come back. He is back. My brother has come back. Look, Brother... It has been 15 years. Every year, I used to keep a rakhi before Guru Nanak for you. And I would pray to Nanaki to bring my brother back to me. And look, he answered my prayers. He sent my brother back to me. Today, my brother is with me. Fate separated me from my family. But this is the only money I could earn in the prison, for your wedding. Brother! -Go! -Their business also got ruined. Not just yet. Look at her daughter. She is quite young and beautiful. Comrade ended up becoming an addict. Go away! Get lost from here! Son, after you and your father went away, the village folk threw us out of the village. We would have had no place to go had Jaswant not supported us. What are you looking at? He is your brother-in-law. Well... Don't you think he is a little too old for you? Don't look at his age. Consider his nature. He has a very good nature. He is very simple. He doesn't lie or cheat. He is very na√Øve. He is very decent. Okay, fine. But where is he? I would like to meet him. He is a lineman for the electricity board. He could be in his office or could have climbed on top of a transformer. Look who is coming. What are you thinking about, Jant? Sister, a lineman deals with electricity every day. How could dad have... I cannot believe it. I don't know how or why it happened, Jant. But we have convinced ourselves. You should do the same as well. Gurjant, it's high time you get married now. I will, as soon as I find someone. First, let me find a house for myself. Why? Isn't this your house? No, this is my sister's house. Now your son is back, I will get you your house back. -But son... -Bye, Mom. I will get going now. I have a lot of work to do. -What do you want? -A job. -What can you do? -Anything that pays. Balkar is a very influential man. Since you have come with his recommendation... I have a job for you, only if you can do it. -It is a dangerous job. -What's the job? All the drug businesses in this area are run by two people. Bhaiya and Angrez. Bhaiya has given Dilbagh a lot of importance. Since they don't interfere in each other's businesses Bhaiya feels that he is the biggest predator here. The goods are coming in. Bhaiya's stuff is coming from across the border. There is wilderness after the border... A jungle across 2-3 kilometers. The stuff will come from the border on scooters. Bhaiya's man will take the delivery on the GT Road. Whatever needs to be done, will only be done in the wilderness. So, can you handle this job? Done. What next? The stuff belongs to Bhaiya's boss, Dilbagh. Dilbagh is worse than Bhaiya. This is like stealing from a lion's mouth. No one knows you here, hence, I have given this job to you. But if anything goes wrong, you have no clue what I can do to you. Do you understand? Who are you? You are smart. Where did this take place? Who is messaging me? The lawyer's message. -What does he say? -Time to fly, Tota. Okay, friends, it's time for me to fly. My dad disappeared when he went out... He has called me to a jungle... My life is in danger. What are you holding... in your hand, lawyer? I hope you aren't blowing anything up. First give me a hug, my love. -Call me Tota, please. -He's Bittu. How are you? Enough! I just asked you to meet, not hug. Shall I get blankets for you to exchange as gifts? Take this. You, too, take one. Are you a monkey that you have climbed up a tree? Listen to me carefully. Two people on scooters will be coming here. They will be Bhaiya's people. And they have some stuff that we need to steal. And Ghuggi, listen carefully. Whenever you talk, use fake names. If you take each other's real names, you will have it from me. You are so adamant that you will never change. Idiot! Charlie! Charlie! Look, Michael is drinking... I was drinking... so that it would be easier to handle the beating if we are caught. I think you will have a tough time being beaten up by me. Now, who is Charlie and Michael? Who told you your names were Charlie and Michael? Now, who is Charlie? -He is Charlie. -And Tota, you are Michael. And I am Roger. If I am Tota, then who is Michael? You are Michael. I was a fool to bring both of you here. What is this nonsense with Tota, Michael, Charlie... I have forgotten my name. They are coming. Listen, do they shoot? You cowards, I hope you don't pass out in fear. Tota, take care of the stuff. Come on. Run for your life. I am a seasoned player. You take care of yourself. Bittu, come here and take care of the stuff. No one is following me. Someone is following me now. Tota, I can see you. Run straight ahead. Hail the sage! Hail Sage Brugunath. Hail Sage Brugunath. Save me today. Hail the sage. How many times have I told you... not to show your back to your enemies! Otherwise, they will shoot at such a place... that you will yearn to even sit in peace all your life. -At least get me down. -And how will Brugunath save you? He is seeking Brugunath's help! Hey... Bittu told me. I have been looking for you. Tell me where my stuff is! Who are you? You seemed very happy, the other day. You said that I am very smart. -What happened now? -Shut up and give me my stuff. Your stuff? The stuff belongs to Bhaiya. Angrez was the one who was eyeing it. And I am the one who stole it. Who are you in all of this? I don't talk to middlemen like you. Go and call Angrez. He is the guy who stole our goods. What should we do about him? -Is it him? -Yes. You stole some drugs for me. Why didn't you bring it along? I heard that you are Angrez, which means foreigner. I had never met a foreigner before. Have you seen one now? You are very much Indian. Your skin color is just like mine. People come to this restaurant to eat, not to get shot. Okay, then. How about feeding me some Parathas? Hey, you, get some Parathas with loads of butter on them. A film star is here. You want to see a film star? Get lost from here. There is a very cruel policeman... Sodhi. He made me and Bhaiya compromise, four years ago... That we wouldn't interfere in each other's businesses. Four years later, Bhaiya has called me up. Someone has stolen his stuff for the first time. He's like a hunting dog, looking for the one who did it. So? If I want, I can tell him who stole his stuff. Then, why are you being so nice? Do what you have to. Are you crazy? Yes, I am crazy. But I am not in a mental asylum. Balkar praised you a lot. Get my men out of prison. Get my men out of prison and I will give you whatever you want. There's a fee for everything. Fee? Shall I give you an advance? Tell me. Take care of these toys. Send your lawyer. Your job will be done. You look amazing wearing lipstick... Yes, tell me. I want my stuff back. And I want that man at any cost. Don't make stupid excuses, otherwise I'll keep hitting you on your head with my shoes that will hurt you for generations. I'm already confused about whether to speak Punjabi or Bhojpuri. And on top of that, you are-- Find out. I don't care. Just find out. No one has dared to even eye my stuff in my area. I don't care. Just find out. Find out. Hurry up. I'm surrounded by idiots. Fill up the tank. And don't forget to add the fuel additive. Tota, did you find out the address? Which address? I smell alcohol on your breath. You should drink less. The left side of my brain isn't working properly. Wait for a few days. Then, I will give you anyone's address you want. Hello? Wait, I am coming there. Did you fill it up? Check if it is less. I don't think he can be bailed out. It's a lady judge and she isn't corrupt either. It's not the judge but the book of law that punishes. Section 307, intentional accident. All right? Okay. Then, in the next hearing, argue as unintentional accident, under Section 294. Say that the accident took place because of a pothole on the road. Bribe the police well and get the F.I.R. out. If the judge says that the road was fine then say that the anti-party got the potholes filled overnight. Is it possible? The other party will ask for some time... And you seek bail overnight under Section 294. Get him out and underground. -I want to meet Khushwant Singh. -Go inside. Here? Give it here. Take it. Jant, Neeru was saying that you don't want to stay with us. And you want to take your mother with you as well. -That's right. -Look... If you don't feel like it, then it's okay. You can take your mother along as well. But Jant, one needs some kind of work to earn a living. You must have thought of something for your life. In prison, I had dreams of starting my life afresh. -And that's why I studied law. -Really? Which law college did you get your degree from? I don't have a degree. In that case, even I am a doctor, but I don't have a degree. At the most, a lawyer will hire you as his secretary. But will that be enough to run your house? It won't help you with anything. Brother-in-law, I just came to meet you. I will get going now. I will come back some other day. Okay, fine. And I was happy to see my sister happy. I owe you for this. No, my boy. It is not a favor. This is what God had destined. You should now think about yourself. Someone from my uncle's village is looking for a match for a girl. Everything matches your taste. Shall I approach them? I will think about it and let you know. Okay, fine, as you wish. Excuse me, sir. Where's Angrez's restaurant? What do you want? You can take it from me. From where do these beautiful women come? -Can I sit over there? -Yes, you can sit there. -Thank you. -Welcome. Who is she? Don't look over there. She is educated. I am not illiterate, you scoundrel. Need I remind you of the stuff you stole? Talk softly. She might hear you. Forget the girl... and tell me what you want in exchange for getting my men out of prison. I want my house. What connection do I have with your house? You have turned it into your warehouse. You are Jant! Sit down. You are surprised to see me alive. I have sent your stuff to Cheema. Now, fulfil your end of the bargain. You have asked for a very big thing. Look, it will be fine if you give it to me. Otherwise, I know ways to take it back. I can be very useful to you. I can take you up to Bhaiya's position. Think about it. As far as your house is concerned, you will get it back. Just do another job for me. This girl wants to do some interviews in our village. No one in the village knows you. Moreover, you know how the people of this village are. They are so suspicious and unfriendly. You just need to give her a tour. -And now, we are like brothers. -I had asked you her name. I didn't ask you for a job to give her a tour of our village. I am asking you to give company to a beautiful girl. You must have not seen any girls in the past 15 years. Look at your face. You look as if you have come from a maximum-security prison. Okay. Let's see. But no one in the village should know that I am Jant. Okay. Take this as well. Take it. Go... Hey, you, won't you come inside? Unbelievable! Hey! Get some fuel quickly. Gurjant? Gurjant, you've called up your mother after a long time. Mom, I am back in our house. Give me just some more time. I feel as if the good old days are back, Mom. I am missing dad a lot, Mom. The same house, the same kitchen... Now, the only thing this house awaits is your presence. Bye, Mom. Comrade, my son is no idiot. He is very capable. Yes, Tota? Let me sleep in peace. I know where Sodhi is. How are you, boys? Your father has a problem with the three of us. With me, Bhaiya and Dilbagh. He keeps saying in the village that he won't let anyone sell drugs. I won't let anyone do this. You are his son... I will take care of you. And both of them will take good care of your father. My name is Sodhi. I will keep one of you in prison. Got it? You go home. I will come tomorrow. You should go home today. He messed with Mr. Sodhi. A lizard trying to scale the Everest. He is bound to die. Come on, throw him inside. Get him inside the jeep. Look, your mother has gone crazy. She is still lying out here. Blood rolled down the eyes As a sign of death for the enemy Today, he will be held up by his neck The one who used to move around proudly The friend who was behind bars Has been freed today Today the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey. Only your death Can bring an end to these problems. There's a lot of strength within me I don't need any weapons There's a lot of strength within me I don't need any weapons Today, I have made up my mind Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey... You love to arrest people, don't you? You made Jangpura miserable for me. Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey Today, the vicious tiger Got hold of his prey... Call after half an hour, Mr. Sodhi. Bhaiya, come to the office immediately. Why? Did you get promotion? I am sleeping. Call later. Sleep later! I am tense. I was fatally attacked this morning Could it be Balkar or Angrez? No. That's impossible. I am not letting Balkar get out of prison. As far as Angrez is concerned... he doesn't have the courage or the status to attack. I will do something. -Cold down. -You have ruined this language. It's not cold down. It's calm down. Forget about that, Mr. Sodhi. A little change here and there is fine. I think, he is someone from this area. Look, Sodhi, I haven't messed with anyone. You tell me what your scene is. You are a dog. Do you have any girl trouble... I mean, any personal trouble? This is no time to joke. I am sure, he is from Jangpura. How can you be sure? He mentioned Jangpura. Jagga... Find out if there is anyone new in the village. Keep an eye out. Listen, call up Angrez. I won't call him up. You call him up. -Why? -He pays you, right? And who hides your filthy deeds? Me, right? But you take money for that, don't you? Eager to eat and uninterested to pay. What? Call him up. Nonsense! Yes, Bhaiya... What is it? You keep disturbing me. What do you want? -Someone tried to kill Sodhi. -I see. He is bound to die if he does such misdeeds. How am I supposed to know who did it? Find the person who tried to kill him. If you find out, call me and let me know. Yes. Okay, fine. What did he say? He is useless. Not just useless, he's also idle. Stop joking. My life is at stake while you are-- Don't worry. If he is from this village... If he is from Jangpura, then be rest assured that we won't miss him. We will find him. Coming! -Yes? -Angrez has sent me. I was waiting. Shall we? What's your name? -Ekam Khanna. -And why are you here? I want to get some interviews on food, cooking, about the women in this village... Why? Don't people cook in other villages? Listen, when I heard about Jangpura I thought it must be an interesting place. Look, if you have any problem with introducing me to people, then I will manage. But, you should talk properly with me, okay? Respect? How was I disrespectful to you? Do you know Punjabi? I hear to Punjabi music. Not hear, it's listen. And tell me the truth. What do you mean? I mean, why are you taking so long to answer me? Angrez said that you aren't from this village. So, why should you worry about why I am here? This means, something is fishy. I will find out on my own. Are you also into this business? No. You have no other option. I am doing a research on those women whose men are drug addicts. Such social work costs dearly, ma'am. I am not scared of anyone. I have come all alone from Canada. Look over here. Over here, please. These foreigners are strange. I don't know what they get from all this. They pick up their cameras and come to India. Now tell me, what are you looking for in this village? If you want some fun, then go to Chandigarh. There's a fair in the village. Don't create a scene over there. Be careful. Offerings, please. Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you I am hooked Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you I am head over heels for your mesmerizing beauty. I am head over heels Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you I want to hold you Against my heart and rule the world I want to know what heaven feels like I want to hold you Against my heart and rule the world I want to know what heaven feels like My life will find a purpose If you come into my life Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you Oh love, get me a cure To save my life Oh, seeing you in this white apparel I am falling for you I saw a tall and handsome boy And I have lost my heart to you Yes, I am very intoxicating You are hooked onto me Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you. Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you Someone could lose his life I can kill for you Someone could lose his life I can kill for you I think it will cause a great war Keep those beautiful eyes away Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you I am head over heels for your mesmerizing beauty Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you Oh girl, you are so intoxicating I am hooked onto you... -Get the files of all cases. -May I come in, sir? Get all of them. Quickly get them in here. SHO Talwinder Singh, sir. I have been transferred to Jangpura Police Station. I am reporting to you. Okay, you may join. -Okay, sir. -Go. Wait. Yes, sir? Listen... -Where have you been posted? -Jangpura, sir. Jangpura. Very good. Join and I will give you your first task as well. Order me, sir. Someone attacked me this morning. What, sir? -Someone attacked you? -Yes. -How is that possible? -That's what you have to find out. I have asked for all the case files. Study all of them well. Check if you can find any clue. While leaving, he said that I love to arrest people. And he also mentioned Jangpura. Tell me, will you do it? It is my job, sir. To catch people and lock them up. Very good. Okay, get to work, then. Sir, will the F.I.R. be filed here or in Jangpura? Chap, do you know anyone in Jangpura? No, sir. Then why do you want to file an F.I.R.? Okay, sir. Understood. Jai Hind. F.I.R.! -There they are. -Okay. Yes, who are you? Who are you? -And who are you? -You don't know me? Jagga, he doesn't know me. -Have you heard about the Headman? -Babban... He is my brother-in-law. This village is mine. The Headman! Who is this beautiful girl? She has come from abroad. I met her at the restaurant. I thought of giving her a tour of this village. -Are you a guide? -Call me Counsellor. Do you have a problem? -Hey... -Babban, listen to me. -Jant? -Hello? Yes, tell me. -Hey! -Where are you? -I'm at the mosque. -Let me tell you what he said. -What happened? -Come here, quickly. I am a little tied up somewhere. Tell me if it's urgent. -There is a problem. -What happened? I don't know. Come quickly. Okay, I am coming. Strange girl! She didn't even tell me she's leaving. You could have at least thanked me, girl. Oh, darn... Come on, get in. Why did you arrest him? I will tell you at the police station. Get in. What did you think? That you will attack DSP Sodhi and the department wouldn't come to know about it? You are not Mr. Invisible that you can just vanish. Let's go. Get in. Officer, keep this gun in your pocket. Because when it is used, it is indifferent towards a police officer. Stop, Jant. Stop. He is Tull, our childhood friend. You are more agile than before. I had told you, you cannot get hold of Jant. Come here, you goon. The corruption in Punjab has increased to such an extent that people like you have become police officers? Hey, you... Live long, my friend. Now untie me as well, you scoundrels. The circumstances in life... Shall I shoot? Had changed Destination was far away Desires were left behind on the way And then many lands were blessed with rain And the withered hearts bloomed again Now life is fun I found my long lost friends Now life is fun I found my long lost friends Now life is fun I found my long lost friends The ones who quote a price for everything They seek profit in friendship too The world is for sale here But you cannot buy friendship The world is for sale here But you cannot buy friendship Friends unite And there are drinks everywhere There are some roars And some meat to eat too The earth quivered When they planned to dance Now life is fun I found my long lost friends Now life is fun I found my long lost friends We stay close to friends and away from girls. We are so addicted to our friendship We stay close to friends And away from girls We are so addicted to our friendship It is true that friends Make life meaningful Only fortunate ones have friends Now life is fun I found my long lost friends Now life is fun I found my long lost friends Even if there is a noose in front of him A man doesn't let go of his pride The world is for sale here But you cannot buy friendship The world is for sale here But you cannot buy friendship The world is for sale here But you cannot buy friendship. The world is for sale here But you cannot buy friendship... What is wrong? Why did you call me so early in the morning? I was looking for you. I have some work for you. What do you want me to do this time? Just one more blow... A hard blow. What do you say? Stop reciting dialogues and tell me the job. A consignment much bigger than the last one, is coming. And this time, it is coming through the river. Selfish. Fully aware of the lack of my intelligence I put my attention on the Son of Wind And humbly ask for strength, Intelligence and true knowledge To relieve me of any blemishes Why are you gibbering? As if, you have lost your mind. Should I not even say my prayers? You prayed yesterday. Why do you have to pray every day? Come here. Listen to my brother's English. Listen, just don't talk about English. I am already confused with two languages. I don't want to learn a third one. Please hear it, brother-in-law. You have 15 seconds. -Here. -I don't have that much time. I will skin you... In what world is that English? And you said some things and made some strange noises -while looking at me... -No... Is he cursing me? -Why would I curse you? -I will know right away. -I will find out right away. -Brother-in-law, where are you going? -Johnson! -Brother-in-law! and they are going to give it to your brother-in-law. And the skin-tight jeans to your sari-wearing sister. Yes. Tell us. Say it. -Dad, she is insulting. -Whom? -Not just him, but his entire family. -You idiot... Who taught you this? That girl... -Brother-in-law, I... -Shut up. What is this? Canada. Press. -How dare she... -Stop. The recordings that you were doing... Where are they? Headman, the village folk said that she was recording something. She is also asking questions. What... What recordings? Recording... Like the one I did on your phone. That is what is called recording. You wouldn't know, you used to have cassettes during your time... Okay, fine. Whatever it is, recording, cassettes, photos... -Take everything from her. -Yes, we will take it. Take it back from her. Was she alone? There was a boy with her. Look, girl, I cannot stop them. They are different kind of people. Just tell him where the recordings are. The recordings are on my laptop. But they are password protected. Okay, here's the passport, show me the recordings. She said password, brother-in-law. Where's the password? It's with that boy who came with me. He is known as Counsellor. He is the one who told me to do all this. Now, who is this Counsellor? Counsellor? -Find out. -Yes. Jai Hind, sir. I have found the person, sir. I found the person who attacked you. I also know where he will be tonight. -Are you certain? -Absolutely, sir. -Is your source reliable? -Very much, sir. Okay, sir, I will prepare my team. Talwinder, I have told you before as well... We don't have to arrest him. We have to kill him. The water level is rising. My aunt has come over. Can I go, my friend? And I'm newly married, myself. Such cowards! At least make an attempt. The boat has left the shore. It will reach here in ten minutes. Let's go... Come on, Bittu. Go and hide. Let's go. Get up, Ghuggi. Run. Go there. Tota! Stop it! Keep an eye on your surroundings. Go and see how many men there are. Let the scoundrels come. Counsellor, they are taking the boat to the other side. What? Couldn't you find out any sooner? You are so adamant that you will never change. I can... -Which boat comes straight... -You should have told me. I knew that the boat would go to the other end. Couldn't you tell me that before? -Get them! -Don't let them escape! I won't let them talk! Wait, you... -Wait! -You... Talwinder, where is he? -There is no one here. -He is over there, sir. -Talwinder... -Look behind you. Officer, did you recognize me? How can I forget that you are not good at that! You only know how to arrest people. Do you remember? Fifteen years ago, you shot one of us in the leg, you let one get away with a warning, and you threw the third one into prison. You are a disgrace to your department. Take off his uniform. Do you recall now? Why have you arrested my son? For God's sake, give my son back to me. Madam, who do you think we are? Dacoits? You... You are Comrade's son? Gurjant. Bittu. Tull. I'm the one you shot in the leg. Jant, I didn't do anything. Well, I had to do it because Bhaiya and Dilbagh asked me to. It is not my fault. They are scoundrels. I... I swear, my friend. You can ask Talwinder. Ask him... We will send them to you, soon. Stop right here... Headman! Headman! Headman! Our stuff was stolen once again. The boy who used to show that girl around, was spotted there. Give me Counsellor's number. Believe me, I don't have it. Just tell me... Who is that boy and what is your connection with him? -I don't know him. -Tell me about him and what the matter is or I will shoot your brains out. I told you, I don't know him. And listen, Mr. Bhaiya, my visa is about to expire. And if I don't reach Canada, the embassy will start looking for me. And then, Canadian Police will come here. Shut up. You are trying to threaten me? Even Punjab Police cannot enter here, let alone Canadian Police! And why are you talking about your aunt so much? Who is this aunt of yours? I will take care of this aunt of yours as well! You are threatening the headman... Open the door! Jagga! Start the car! I will decide what to do with this Counsellor! Take the girl to the hideout. If she makes a fuss then shoot her. Do it now! What is this? What is this, really? I have told you a thousand times that when I am in the car... -you should not play Punjabi songs. -Okay. What's so great about these Punjabi songs! Tell me. What's so special about them? Bhangra? Alcohol? -Well... -The girl? The boy? Derogatory lyrics, terrible singers! What else does it have? -Melody... Have you ever heard a melody? -No. I'll show you what it is. Here, listen to this. Yes, this is it! Different! There is emotion in it. There is mood. Hey! Stop! Stop! Go back a little. Hey, you! Come here! Hello, sir. -What do you do? -A little dusting and cleaning. This was Angrez's warehouse, right? -It was. It has been vacated now. -Why? I have heard that a new owner has showed up. Who is this new owner? The old owner is the new owner. The old owner is the old owner. Who is the new owner? The new owner is the old owner. But Comrade was the old owner. Comrade's son too... No. It cannot be his son. I have heard rumors... It could be his son. Why did you hide such important news from me? Why didn't you tell me? Headman, I just heard rumors. They could be fictitious. Whether they are rumors, hearsay or gossip you should tell me. -Okay, Bhaiya. -Unbelievable! Let's go now. Our stuff getting stolen Comrade's son and that Canadian girl... Is Angrez trying to stab us in the back again? Let's move. Who did you sell Comrade's house to? And how does this concern you? Didn't Dilbagh tell you that you shouldn't enter my house or my restaurant? Shut up, you scoundrel. You are safe because you are related to Dilbagh. -You cheated and came here. -Cheated? It was Dilbagh who cheated me by calling me here from Canada. He seized my passport and gave me a useless restaurant to run. And gave me a burrow to live in. Don't beat around the bush. Okay? Just answer my question. I am losing my mind! A boy and a girl... The girl says that the boy, that is, Counsellor, knows everything. And no one knows who Counsellor is. You have come from Canada and that girl too is from Canada. What is the connection? What is this mess? Don't tell me. The girl is with me. -I'll make her talk-- -Headman, we need to talk. Sodhi has been murdered. -When? -They found the body this morning. -Where? -By the river. You saved some money. My friend Sodhi was murdered by someone and they threw him into the river Beas. You got what you wanted, didn't you? -Give me an answer. -Do you remember Comrade? An obstacle for you and Dilbagh! Now, solve the puzzle. Call him up. -Yes, tell me. -Hello, sir. I seek your blessings. Well... Actually... There is a big problem here. I think Angrez is playing a game with me. Angrez might be related to me, but you are the one I trust. Yes, sir. Get this straight. Don't grieve for Sodhi. This is how such idiots usually die. We don't need the police to get our work done. We can get it done with the power of money. -Don't worry. I am coming. -May God be with you. At least, sometimes, you should call out for good reasons. You are always in trouble. Bhaiya knows that you are Jant. He had come to me. He asked who I gave your house to. So, I told him. You cannot keep a secret, Angrez. You are weak. There's more. Bhaiya has kidnapped Ekam. Darn it... Do something. Angrez, you are the root cause of all my problems. You always get me into trouble. Look, before Bhaiya finds out that you are behind the taking his house and his stuff, you should get the girl safe. Until now, even I didn't know that she is a journalist. Look, we have to get another favor. We must send her back to Canada. Because if an inquiry is initiated then it will cause a lot of trouble. Tell me something... Have you started liking that girl? She is also trying to do the same thing that I am. No matter how you convince yourself... I will need you tonight. Okay. And your car too. -Where is Ekam? -Who are you? You will fear for your life if I tell you who I am. -Where is Ekam? -I don't know. Where is Ekam? I made a huge mistake by trusting you. You ruined everything for me. Never come back to this village! And Jant, you too. Don't come back to this village. Please, don't come here again. I still have a big score to settle, Angrez. Your father also lost his life because of these scores. What do you mean? Stop the car. I said stop the car. What happened to my father? What happened to my father? Dilbagh and Bhaiya purposefully blew up the fuse for the transformer. When your father climbed the transformer to change the fuse... they asked an employee at the Mukandpur Electricity Board to turn the power on. This was done by Bhaiya and Dilbagh. Both of them were in it, together. That employee from Mukandpur Electricity Board is my brother-in-law. Brother-in-law, come to the fields. No, I need to discuss something important. Come soon. Jant, what is wrong? What is it? Is everything all right? How did my father die? Didn't your mother and Neeru tell you? They told me what they knew. And you tell me the rest. Hey, what can I tell you? You killed my father, didn't you? Jant! Just tell me. I am furious right now. Look, it was a mistake. I didn't know that Comrade had climbed up the transformer. I was in the office. When I went to the Switch Room after lunch, I saw in the register that I am supposed to turn it on at 2 p.m. Someone from the board had even called me to tell me the same. Then, your conscience must have pricked you. That's why you got married to my sister! Do you think I will spare you, just because of that? Do you still think that I had a hand in killing your father? If you think so, you can punish me as you want. Look, I am not saying this under any pressure. I have made a huge mistake. Well, I... I got tricked by Dilbagh. I feel like killing you right now! I tolerated seeing my mother as a widow. But I won't be able to tolerate seeing my sister as a widow, too. He is innocent. It takes courage to accept one's mistake. Look, you are a nice person. And a nice person has the strength to forgive. Come home. Come on, dear, you come along as well. Go, brother-in-law. Sister must be waiting for you. You have created a new problem now. Listen to me very carefully. The situation is quite bad. You should disappear for a few days. Keep the girl with you. -The S.S.P. summoned me. -What? He is quite furious. He wants you, no matter what! Why are you grumpy? You should smile sometimes. Life never gave me a chance to smile. I lost my friends when I was a kid. And when I was young, I got the news of my father's demise. I have spent half my life fighting destiny. You look good when you smile. Keep smiling. Okay, I will go and get some things from the market. -Take care. -Okay. Bhaiya, why are you here? Your boss is here. Brother Dilbagh. Hello! Welcome! Wonderful. I sent a street pedlar from Canada here... I gave him a job. I gave him a luxurious life. And you... A relative can never be loyal. You! Hold him against the pillar. You were acting too smart, weren't you? What were you saying about him? Say it. Tell him! You tried to mess with us! A bastard is always a bastard. You tried to mess with us! You tried to mess with us! You tried to mess... Angrez used to stay here before. Who stays here now? Well, Comrade's son stays here. Comrade's son? -You had killed him, right? -No. I thought that since he was a kid why should I kill him? So, you know, I sent him to prison for life. How could you make such a big mistake? Throw these things out. Throw them out. Hurry up. -Scoundrels... -Throw everyone out. Come on. Where is his family? They ran away. It has been many years. We don't know where they are. He had two friends. One is Bittu, the peon. -Where's the other one? -I will find out about him. Find him. Find him and kill him. And also find Gurjant. Understood? I heard that he ran away. He had a Canadian girl with him. That girl was no less either. She is a journalist. She made recordings on her camera and took them with her. And what were you doing when she took the recordings and left? You have such useless men working for you! That's why you rot here. -Let's go, boys. -Sir... Fools! Ekam? Where did she go? -Did you see any girl here? -No. Where were you? How is my dress? Are you flirting with me? Where did you get the money from? From your wallet. You didn't tell me... How do I look? I had told you the other day, you look intoxicating! O God, let my beloved stay with me O God, let my beloved stay with me My heart is still unsated Let me look at her to my heart's content Let me look at her to my heart's content O God Let my beloved stay with me O God Let my beloved stay with me I haven't asked for much From You, O Lord If You grant this to me I will always be grateful, O Lord If You grant this to me I will always be grateful, O Lord Let one heart hear What the other has to say Let one heart hear What the other has to say My heart is still unsated Let me look at her to my heart's content Let me look at her to my heart's content O God, let my beloved stay with me... O God, let my beloved stay with me... In my heart There lies a lot of love for my beloved More beautiful than this world Is the sight of my beloved More beautiful than this world Is the sight of my beloved My heart is fervent Let it calm down a little today My heart is fervent, Let it calm down a little today My heart is still unsated Let me look at her to my heart's content Let me look at her to my heart's content O God, let my beloved stay with me O God, let my beloved stay with me O God Let my beloved stay with me O God Let my beloved Stay with me O God, let my beloved Stay Stay with me... Sir, the girl says that Dilbagh, who had come from Canada, killed him. Bhaiya was also with him. And there were two other people with them. PRINCIPAL -Yes Tull. -Bittu, Dilbagh is here. He killed Angrez. You should take your wife and leave the village. Leave immediately, okay? Bittu! Don't worry, Bittu. I will soon send your friend Counsellor behind you. That won't take long. They'll be dead too. We might be from different mothers But our hearts used to beat as one You feel incapacitated and helpless When your friends are gone We might be from different mothers But our hearts used to beat as one You feel incapacitated and helpless When your friends are gone The whole world looks empty Our friend has left our company Everything is for sale in this world But nobody can put a price on friendship Everything is for sale in this world But nobody can put a price on friendship Everything is for sale in this world But nobody can put a price on friendship Everything is for sale in this world But nobody can put a price on friendship Everything is for sale in this world But nobody can put a price on friendship We can buy off the entire world But my friend, we won't find you anywhere! My friend, we won't find you anywhere! Nobody can put a price on friendship... Dilbagh has purchased the sugar mill. Bhaiya is with him. Get them. I will handle the police. Now, it's a do-or-die situation. You will get your things here. Wait for me over here. Will you come? It's a game of fate. So, let's leave it on fate. Wonderful! Found it... and snatched it away too. Yes, sir. Whose things are these? Does anyone stay here? Who stays here? I don't know. Well, Jant used to stay here. What is he saying? You knew? Did you know this? No, sir. Wait a minute. Why didn't you tell me? Well, I, too, just found out about it. -Sorry, sir! -To heck with that! Find him! Gurjant, you scoundrel! Throw his things out! You dog! Where are you? Come out! So, is he Comrade's son, whose father we killed? Yes, sir, he is the root cause of all our problems. Stop dreaming about capturing a storm and controlling a tsunami, Dilbagh Singh! Because I, Gurjant, am a volcano who kept boiling in prison for 15 years. You will turn into ashes if I erupt. Hey! Get him! Boys, take these and chop him into small pieces. -Take it! -Take it! -Wait, I will chop you into pieces now. -I won't spare him. -Where is he? -He shouldn't survive. -Kill that scoundrel. -Check where he is! Wait, you scoundrel! Wait here! -Catch him! -Get him! -Where did the scoundrel go? -Where did he go? You, go over there. Both of you go there. He must be there. Check over there. You... I had told you never to leave a young snake alive! You dog! You are Massa Rangarh. You are Ahmed Shah Abdali! You have covered my Gurus and this land, in blood. You took my father away from me! You made my mother leave her house! You got millions of boys in Punjab, addicted to drugs. But now, when cowards like you are born here... mothers in Punjab will give birth to brave sons like me. You dog! Can you see, Dad... Look, Dad, your Tiger avenged your death. I am your Tiger, Dad. Oh, my God! I told you to wait for me over there. Whenever I trusted you, you messed things up. Don't think of me as crazy. Please call me by my name. You are completely crazy, Jant. Cases were fought against Jant for Bhaiya and Dilbagh's murder. But, due to lack of witnesses and with the help of a few good people, the court let Jant go scot-free. And the promise Jant had made to his mother... He fulfilled it. Hey, girl! It's time I am so brawny, and it cannot be hidden We escape the greatest Of accusations with ease I am so brawny, and it cannot be hidden We escape the greatest Of accusations with ease We have left the gangsterism behind now!
