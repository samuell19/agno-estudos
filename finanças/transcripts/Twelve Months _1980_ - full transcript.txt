Twelve Months Fly to me, my dears! Here's some bread for you. And this is for you. Share fairly, so everyone gets something. Anna! Anna!! I'm here. Are you feeding those freeloaders again? Have you forgotten that work awaits you? I'm so tired of you, you good-for-nothing girl. Take the axe and go to the forest for some brushwood. Go. Go, and feed your birds there. Begone!! Just you try coming back! - Anna! - Yes? We are going to the town to buy New Years presents. And you, go immediately to the forest and gather lots of brushwood, understood? Yes. Let's go quickly or there won't be anything left to buy because of her. Alright, my dear. I, too, am eager to visit the town. I am not crying Even if I am sad For the pure white snow Will erase the sadness Will erase the sadness Even if I am alone, I am not broken For the large forest Will embrace me gently Will embrace me gently The forest that is My mother's breast The forest that is My mother's breast I am not crying Even if treated unkindly For the pure white snow Will erase the pain Will erase the pain I am not broken Even if I am lonely For the large forest Will sing gently Will sing gently The forest that is My mothers voice The forest that is My mothers voice I wont cry Even if I am sad I wont be broken Even if I am alone Director: Kimio Yabuki Art Director: Syuhei Kawamoto Animators: Michihiro Kaneyama, Takashi Abe, Mokuna, Akihiro Ogawa Composer: Vladimir Krivcov Music: Leningrad Philharmonic Symphonic Orchestra Good afternoon, Mr. Soldier. Good afternoon, young one. Looks like you've become lost. Aren't you scared to be alone in the forest? Not at all. I must collect brushwood. At this time?! Who sent you during such weather? It couldn't have been your own mother! My awful stepmother sent me. - My mother died. - I see... Is there no one who can do something on your behalf? No, no one. And where is your father? Why does he allow your stepmother to hurt you? My daddy... he's also dead. Oh, you poor dear. So small and already a complete orphan. Oh well, don't be sad. I'll help you now. Oh, no, Mr. Soldier, don't! Don't worry, I'll fill your sledge with brushwood in a blink. Thank you, Mr. Soldier! Well... I didn't think I would meet anyone in the forest at this time... Have you come for brushwood as well? Oh, no. I was ordered to go to the forest... ...and cut the prettiest fir for one very capricious girl. And who is she, this capricious girl? Our queen. What? A fir tree for the queen herself?! Yes, a fir for the queen. And I must hasten so I can set it up in the largest hall of the palace. What for? Have you forgotten that tomorrow is New Years? The fir will be decorated with golden and silver toys, as well as precious stones. And the queen's most cherished dolls will also sit under it. Oh? Does your queen still play with dolls? Of course. After all, she is about your age. And I haven't played with dolls for a long time. Yes, your life is hard. You need to work a lot. Yes... Our queen, on the other hand, does not even know what work means. Well... That's why she is the Queen. That is so... She became the queen while still a baby after her parents died. So, she is an orphan, just like me? Looks like that... Both of you are orphans. Poor girl. I feel sorry for her too. No one's there to give her a good advice or teach her some wisdom. She grows up so capricious. You know what I came up with? - And what have you come up with? - Here is what: I will help you! I know where the most beautiful fir in the forest grows. Oh, thank you very much! Here! Look at how beautiful it is. True, I haven't seen its like before! This is my present to the orphan queen! Ah, such a splendid fir tree! - Excuse us, Your Highness! - Your Highness, excuse us! Please hear us out. I'm so tired of you all. You won't let me admire the tree. Well? What is it? I am sorry to say, Your Highness, but the time for your lessons has come. Your Highness, please, make a decision about this petition. I need to write something again? Only one of two words, Your Highness. Which one would you deign to put down? Which words are they, then? "To pardon" or "to hang". A man's life is decided by those words. You must remember about that. P - a - r - d - o - n H - a - n - g Let it be "hang". This word is shorter. - Yes. - But, Your Highness, wait, the case is... Silence. I wish it to be so. This word is easier to write. Yes, of course, you are right. H - a - n - g Mister Tutor, have I written it prettily? Yes, of course, very pretty, but... Your Highness... Now, let us start the lessons. How much is six times six? I don't know... Well, Your Highness... You're always critical of my answers. I'm tired of it. Let us study something else. I don't need arithmetic. That's not allowed, Your Highness. You are forgetting whom you are talking to! Be silent! Or else I will order to hang you too. I'm silent, I'm silent, Your Highness. Six times six is three. Well? No... I mean, yes. Seven times eight will be... ten. Yes, I mean, no. Three times three will be one hundred. That's it, Mister Tutor. I am astounded, Your Highness. I don't know what to say... Hurry, give me "excellent". I'm satisfied with you today. You gave me "Excellent". Yes. Now, what more do we have? Oh well, we've finished with arithmetic for today. Let us talk about the calender. So, a year consists of twelve months, and four seasons: Spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I like spring. Spring starts in April. First comes January, then February, then March, and finally, April. I wish for it to start now. I am sorry, Your Highness, but that's impossible. - Silence! - I'm silent, I'm silent... You're always contradicting me. No, no, I am sorry, but Your Highness... ...there are laws of Nature, which are more powerful than we are. If that's so, then I order the law to be changed immediately. But no one can do that. You are arguing with me again... But, Your Highness... No need to get so excited. Let us clear this up calmly. Clear up what? That, for example, each season is wonderful in its own right... ...and is bringing us its specific gifts. Look. Give me that. {\pos(429.085,98)\frz343.6}Snowdrops Ah, such delightful flowers! This is a flower of April, the Snowdrop. The snowdrop... I haven't seen such a flower in the palace garden. I am sorry, Your Highness, but the snowdrop is a forest flower. I want to see it right now. It is not too long until April. Another ninety days will pass and snowdrops will bloom in the forest. Did you just say ninety days?! You'd make the queen wait for ninety days? Tomorrow we are having a New Year Ball at the palace. I wish for the dinner table to be decorated with these flowers. These flowers... well... what did you call them..? Snowdrops. Yes, that's right, snowdrops. Here they are. However, Your Highness, the laws of nature cannot be changed. Then I shall put into effect new laws. Hey, somebody, immediately call the Minister. "By the New Year celebration We are issuing a decree: Let snowdrops bloom during New Year time and stand opened up. By this We bid to present to the Court a full basket of snowdrops! The one, who performs our High Will, shall be generously rewarded..." Decree of Her Highness, the Queen. From now on the snowdrops shall bloom by New Year. On New Year's Eve it is ordered to deliver to the palace... ...a basket of snowdrops. Whoever performs the Queen's will, shall be granted... ...a basket of gold coins! What?! A basket full of gold coins?! Oh! Oh! Gold coins! Let's hurry! Ah! I want to have snowdrops at the palace. What?! Snowdrops? Yes, snowdrops. Have you gone deaf? Quick, go to the forest and fetch some. You know the forest better than our backyard. What are you saying? You must be joking. How can there be snowdrops in midwinter? No jokes. We heard that at the town with our very own ears. You are so thick! Now, listen carefully. A basket full of gold coins was promised for the snowdrops. The queen won't pay for any old grass. Oh, so cold, so cold... Are you still here..? Go this instant, before someone beats us to them. Look at that blizzard. It is sure death to go out into the forest in such weather? Go this instant! True. Stop living like a freeloader. It's time you start earning money. Yes, yes, do some work. Take the basket and get cracking! Why are you giving her a new basket? She might lose it. I've only just bought it. Don't be greedy. The new basket will hold more gold coins. All right. Let her take it. But just you try losing it and not bringing any flowers back! But where shall I find snowdrops?! I beg of you, don't send me to the forest! Do you hear what she is saying? Maybe you want me to go to the forest, eh? Poor, poor me... Oh, well... I shall go... will freeze... lose my way... will be snowed in... Don't cry, my silly girl. We have only just returned from the town, and are completely frozen through and tired. While you were in the warmth, Anna! Well?! Now, hurry!! And don't come back without snowdrops. Sorry about calling you "silly girl". Ah, doesn't matter. The way I was crying... You know, she is actually right: There are no snowdrops in the forest in winter. She might die out there... Let her. No great loss. Then there won't be an extra mouth to feed in our house. That is true. My clever girl! Oh, it's so frightening here. Even the animals have hid themselves and are sleeping in their burrows. That's wolves! I can't walk any more. I will die here. Mummy!! Daddy!!! What's happening to me? Am I dreaming? What's that? Mummy? Ah, I must be dreaming it! Excuse me, please, may I warm up by the fire? What shall you say to this, brothers? Until this age, this fire, save for us, hath not ever a living soul approached. But this girl is frozen through. Besides she is already here. Let her come to the fire and get warm. Come closer. Don't be afraid. Thank you, you are very kind. It's so warm here. I nearly died in the forest. But what are you doing out here; alone and in the cold? My evil stepmother sent me to the forest to fetch some snowdrops. Snowdrops?! It's funny, isn't it? There can't be snowdrops in winter. I've warmed up now, and I'm in a much better mood. Thank you very much, but I must go. I have to go. Excuse me for bothering you. Wait up! Where are you going to at night in such blizzard? Do you... really believe that you will find snowdrops? It's useless. In winter everything is covered by large snowdrifts. Besides, you really could die in this dense forest. Today is the first time I've ever seen you... so sad. Do you know me? Of course, I often meet you in the forest. Tell me, who are you? I am the month of April. With me spring comes and everything wakes to life. We, Brother Months know all about you. You are a kind, nice girl. Many a time have we watched how you feed forest birds and animals. Yes, we know everything about you. We know that you are an orphan. And your evil stepmother... makes you do backbreaking tasks. Brother January, I ask of you... ...grant this girl one hour of your time. Very well. I will agree. Oh, Earth, remove the shackles of winter's sleep! Don't be afraid. Ah, I'm scared. And now, it is your turn, Brother February. Blizzards and snowstorms, begone! Oh, the snow is melting! Ah, the light is so bright! And now it is my turn. Look, soon you will get your snowdrops. What?! Snowdrops?! Oh, how beautiful! Spring! Spring has arrived! Oh, snowdrops! My little friends. You showed up too. Where is all this from? Is it just a dream? You think this is a dream? Let it be so. We present you with an hour of springtime. Then, this is not a dream. Thank you. So many snowdrops! What is this? The spring is only on this clearing. While it snows over there. Incredible. I am so grateful to you all. I would have probably frozen to death in the forest,... ...should I not have met you. I will always remember your kindness, dear Brother Months. We are very glad that we could help you. Here, take this ring to remember us by. Ah, so pretty. You can look at it and remember us. Thank you, Brother April. This is not a simple ring. If you experience hardship, just say: "Roll, roll, little ring To the doorstep of the Spring. Over the Summer's high halls, And through the Autumn's stalls. Onto the Winter's frozen attire, Coming to rest by the New Year's bonfire!" But if you lose it, you will never be able to meet us again. Thank you, I shall treasure it. And now, listen to me. You have met the Twelve Months on this New Year's Eve. You have collected snowdrops, the flowers of April. We do this exceedingly seldom. We have broken Nature's law by granting you one hour of spring. Therefore, no one shall learn of what happened here tonight. I shall be silent. And now, farewell. Farewell, girl. Go. Hurry, before I have returned biting frosts to the surface of the earth. Yes. Goodbye, Brother April. Goodbye, Anna. Thank you, Brother Months! Praying for you... Mummy, daddy... Look, look daughter. These are real snowdrops. Really?! Oh, it's a miracle. They really are snowdrops. Now we'll surely get a basket full of gold coins. I told you to give her a larger basket. There's nothing we can do about it. How could we have expected her to return at all, let alone with a basket full of snowdrops? Wait, I have an idea. What? Here is what. We shall take the largest basket we have, fill it with earth,... ...and will put the snowdrops on top. Clever girl. You take after me, my daughter. The basket is huge! We'll get sooo many gold coins! We'll have enough for the rest of our lives. Still, it's interesting. Where did this good for nothing girl get the snowdrops from? Isn't it all the same to you? Most importantly, we'll get our money! Yes, that is true. Anna, enough sleeping. Ah, what a ring! Why has my order not been carried out?! Where are the snowdrops? If I don't get them, there will be no new year. I am sorry, Your Highness... ...but the guests have already arrived for the New Year Ball. And what is this ball for, if there is no new year? But, Your Highness, today is the first of January! Yes?! You are mistaken. Teacher, how many days are there in December? Um, actually, 31, Your Highness. Then today is the 32nd of December. I've never heard of such a thing before! I don't understand what's so strange here. Tomorrow will be the 33rd of December, and the day after tomorrow, the 34th. Teacher, do continue. But, Your Highness, such a thing has never happened before. Never. Pardon me, Your Highness. What is the matter? A basket of snowdrops has just been delivered to Your Highness' palace. Have you heard? Someone brought me snowdrops. Give them to me! Look how pretty they are. They are real snowdrops! What have you to say to this, Teacher? I am speechless! What is it? Yes, yes, they are snowdrops. So, from this moment, new year starts in my Country. Happy New Year, Your Highness! Happy New Year. Er... I felicitate you, Your Highness. I, too, felicitate you. - Er... Well... - What? Well... the basket full of gold coins... Very well, you have both earned a reward. Tell me, it must have been hard, looking for the flowers under the snow. Yes, we had to work hard. Couldn't shut our eyes for the whole night. Where have you found them in winter? Er... Well... Well... So... We were walking and walking... Still, this is impossible. Snowdrops in January. Then answer, what is in your hands? Yes, but... Tell my teacher, where you found them. We... them... well... My Mother and I were walking though such a blizzard... We were wandering through the forest in such a frost, Your Highness... And we saw there such... such a lake... round like a plate. So you say, there is a round lake? ...and there, by that lake... um... Yes, on that lake's shore, there's a myriad of flowers. And all are snowdrops? No, different flowers... ...and berries: strawberries, cowberries, blueberries... That is wonderful. And yet, that cannot be. Snowdrops? In winter? Minister, I wish to immediately visit this wonderful lake. So we're canceling the New Year's Ball? You shall lead me there. Oh, Your Highness, have mercy on us? What's the matter? Oh, but it's... too far... We could lose our way in the forest and freeze. Too far? I signed the decree only yesterday and you brought the flowers this morning. But it's so cold in the forest. Huge snowdrifts were blown in. Uh... It's impossible to go in a carriage. Not a chance. I will order the soldiers to clear the road if it is snowed in. And the lake is no longer there. It's disappeared. - How? - It's frozen in and covered with ice. What about the snowdrops? They also froze and withered away. Why didn't these ones freeze? I don't know. Now then, confess, where did you get the flowers? Your Highness, why are you talking to them? They are scoundrels who just want to get a basket of gold. Just execute them. Oh, Your Highness! What for? Either you tell the truth or you will be immediately executed. Well. Your Highness, we confess that we don't know where the snowdrops grow. Yes, we don't know. How is that? Because it was not us, who picked them. So that's it! You didn't pick them. Who then? You see... It's our layabout... A layabout? Ah! Looks like I've overslept. Where is my ring? It's nowhere to be seen! Oh, dear! I'll try to remember... When I came in, the ring was on my finger. Brother April told me that if I am in trouble, I should say... Roll, roll, little ring To the doorstep of the Spring. Over the Summer's high halls, And through the Autumn's stalls. Onto the Winter's frozen attire, Coming to rest by the New Year's bonfire! No, that was not a dream! I also remember that when I returned, New Year bells were ringing,... ...while I was so tired that I fell asleep in my clothes. Someone took off the ring while I was asleep! This is terrible! Anna! We are home! My dear daughter, have you woken up? Have you called me, "dear daughter"? You, you, my dearest. You've stolen a ring from me! Give me back the ring this instant! What ring? Did you take it? I haven't even seen it. I beg of you, return my ring! After all, I brought you snowdrops! Do you know, dear daughter, that we can be executed because of your snowdrops? Only you can save us. Please! I don't know what you mean. The queen wants you to take her to the place,... ...where the snowdrops grow. Or else we will be executed. Accompany the queen?! Oh, pity us! We are lost! Lost! But even the queen cannot be shown to that place. That's not in my power. Then just show the way... No, I can't. Hey, I remembered about your ring... About my ring? Yes, I found it in our yard,... ...and then the queen saw it on me and took it away. Yes, yes, she said that she will return it to you,... ...if you show her the way to that place. She said so, didn't she? Yes, yes, yes, that's what she said. I cannot lead even the queen there. I could probably pick her some more snowdrops. Then I shall go with you. No! I can't go with you! But... Oh, well, go alone. Go, hurry, and remember our lives are in your hands. As we agreed. You will follow Anna, while I will run to the palace to tell the queen. Very well. But give me plenty of colourful rags. What do you need those rags for? You are so unperceptive! I will hang them on branches and you will be able to find the way to the place where the snowdrops grow. Ah, you are so clever! I am back, Your Highness. I will lead you to the place, where snowdrops grow. So, we are leaving for the round lake. Yes. Let's move! Wait! Wait for me! I shall help you. Oh, she is so heartless. Faster! Faster! So you were following me. That's not fair. You promised. Hold on, you. Let me brush off the snow You promised me! Besides, you are almost there. Why are you angry? You tricked me. I will not go further. - It is too late now. - Why? Soon the queen and her entourage will be here. Look at these marking. There... I am so stupid to have believed you. Ha! No use crying now. What now? Walk on foot? Affirmative, Your Highness. The sledge cannot go any further. There, be careful. And... jump! Oh, dear. Did you hurt yourself, Your Highness? No, I'm fine. I even liked it. It's cold. Your Highness. Your Highness! Come quickly over here. Look, here is the sign. Your layabout brought us to such an awful place. Hey, people, give me another fur coat. Yes. Let me, Your Highness. Maybe this will suit you? It's all the same to me now. Thank you. You saved me from cold. Do not mention it. It's my duty. Why are you drying you forehead? Is it hot for you? Pardon me, Your Highness. Guilty. Still, why are you drying your forehead? You see, I'm all sweaty... What does sweaty mean? Well... You see... Your Highness, that's what common folk say. It means that he is hot. Hot? While I am dying from cold? He is working vigorously with a spade. Is that so? Give it to me. Yes. One... and two... And one... and two... - Your Highness, stop, you are, after all, the Queen! - And one... Don't worry. Nothing will happen to her. Your Highness, I beg of you, you are not supposed to... And one... and two... And... one... And... two... And one... Oh... It's hot! I am completely sweaty. Oooo.... Did I say something wrong? Yes? Not at all, Your Highness. Everything is correct. That's it! I am really, really sweaty. Please forgive me, Brother Months, that this happened. Please forgive me, Brother April. I've lost your ring. What shall I do now? Found it, found it! I've found it! You don't say! Have you found the snowdrops? This is some miracle. - I've found a round lake. - Impossible! You see, when we were in the palace, I told the queen... ...that we picked snowdrops on the shore of a round lake. And it turns out it really exists! Oh, is that you, little one?! Oh, Mr. Soldier. What for did you come to the forest today? Not of my own will, but by the bidding of our queen. - The queen? - Did you hear that? The queen ordered us to find a lake, which does not exists in this parts. Oh, yes, it exists! I've found it. Eh? What are you making up? Is this girl that layabout, of whom you were talking? - Yes. - Yes. I thought you would be scary and ugly, but you are quite pretty. Why are they calling you a layabout? Was it you who picked snowdrops for me? Yes. This means that the basket of gold coins is yours. Would you also like some beautiful clothes and precious jewellery? Want to? I am very happy that you liked my flowers,... ...but I don't need neither money, nor clothes, nor any jewels. How can I then express my gratitude? I want you to return me my little ring. Your ring? Which ring? Er... Your Highness... - Don't listen to this good-for-nothing girl. - She is making it all up, Your Highness. Making it up?! So you again lied to me, saying the the ring was taken by the Queen?! I see. Show me the ring this instant! Your Highness, we don't know what ring she is talking about. Well, how long will I have to wait? - Guards! - Yes! So, where is the ring? We'll return the ring! Here it is! My little ring! Silence! Give it to me this instant! Yes, of course. Here, Your Highness. Marvellous! Even I don't have one like this. Very well, I shall return it to you. Thank you. You are very kind. But first you must tell me where you picked the snowdrops. Oh, Your Highness, don't ask me about that. Why? I... I cannot tell you. Why is that? I am the Queen and you must obey me. Or else I will order to execute you! As you wish. But I promised that I would never tell anyone. Whom did you promise to? I cannot tell you. Anna! Tell! Tell quickly! Hmpf! Very well. If you don't want to speak, then you will never see the ring again. Don't! I am throwing it! One... Two... Three... My little ring! Did you really think I threw it? Well? Here it is, in my hand. Just tell me, where the snowdrops are from, and I will immediately return it. I don't understand, why you are so stubborn. Well, are you going to speak? What's with you? Throw it away. Are you going to be like this? Blame yourself, then. Where are you off to? Roll, roll, little ring To the doorstep of the Spring. Over the Summer's high halls, And through the Autumn's stalls. Onto the Winter's frozen attire, Coming to rest by the New Year's bonfire! Oi, look, this is a blizzard! Brothers Months! Oi, oi, oi! Help me! Save me! Your Highness! - Mama, my shawl! - Forget it, fool. Look, look! The spring has come! Can't be! A butterfly... I can't believe my eyes. This cannot be! Look, the ice on the lake is melting! This can't be! Ah, everything has melted! Your Highness! - Come here quick! - What is the matter there? Hurry up, Your Highness! Oh, they are disappearing! Where? Where are the snowdrops? They've just been growing here. So where have they disappeared to? Summer, summer! Summer has come! It's hot. Somebody, give me some water. Such heat. Nothing to breathe with... I am suffocating... Oh, I don't want to move... Still, something incredible is happening. Of course, this is not a dream. First came the spring, then summer arrived. It's raining! What is happening?! Your Highness, here is your water. What do I need water for? I am soaked through as it is. Yes, true, water is everywhere. It was summer just now, and suddenly it started to rain so... Your Highness, this is late autumn. Then winter will come soon after? Hold on to me, Your Highness! Catch my fur coat! Oi, oi, I am flying somewhere. Mummy, I am letting go... Looks like the wind has abated, Your Highness. Look, all leaves have been blown from the trees. Oh, my poor bones. Did you hurt yourself, Professor? No, no, this is all a hallucination. Whatever is happening to us, today, is the First of January by Nature's Law. Ah, look, it's snowing! Finally, this is correct. Ha, I told you, I told you so! Look, real winter! I was right! It's snowing! It's snowing! He behaves like a child. Snow and ice is here! My truth has prevailed! Look, the lake has become covered with ice, too. There... There... Oh! Oi! Oi! Hold me! Truly, like a kid. Ah, it's becoming scary. I will soon freeze through. Give me my coat. And give us the coats! Quick! Where is my fur coat? Alas, everything has been carried away by the wind. Oh, look up there! A fur coat! - That's my coat! - No, it's mine, I saw it first! - No, I was first! - You call yourself mother?! - Mine! - No, mine, will not give! - Mine! Mine! - Will not give it to you! How lowly! They are fighting like two dogs! You call yourself my own daughter! Take this! You, viper, behave yourself like a dog! This is just absurd! This cannot be! What, attacking the queen?! Away with you! Calm down, Your Highness, I've chased them away. I am scared anyway. People turning into dogs... It's cold again. Not to worry. We'll make a fire. Oh. Look at the lake! A fire is burning there! Magic again?! Now, open your eyes and look around. Ah, my little ring! And this beautiful, warm fur coat! This is my present to your for being able to keep your promise. This sledge is also yours. Return home in it. What? And the sledge is for me?! Look, there is your coachman. Excuse me, could you please give us a ride to... I am the Queen of this land. Immediately take me to the palace on this sledge! This girl is the master of the sledge. Ask her. Should I ask this plain girl? Ah, this is that very same layabout. Oh, is that you, young'n. Glad to see you. Good day, Mr. Soldier. We meet again. But you are not recognisable. You look like a true queen. What are you saying? I am the Queen here. Of course. Pardon me, Your Highness. Why are the dogs here? Ah, so you come back? These are your stepmother and sister. They quarrelled and turned into dogs. How could they turn into dogs? Yes, these dog were your relatives. My relatives? Could this really happen? People turned into dogs? They were snarling and throwing themselves at each other, so they became dogs. So many miracles happened today, that even this could come to pass. Still, they've become affectionate. Are they going to stay as dogs until they die? Why? They will guard the house and the yard, and then,... ...if they become nice, bring them here on New Year's Eve. And then they will turn back into humans? Yes. That's wonderful. You are too kind. They have given you so much grief. And for that they were punished. I too... was not fair to her. That is so. Please, Your Highness, be seated in the sledge. What? You would agree to give me a ride to the palace? I will gladly do it. Are you not angry that I... threw away your ring? It was not lost. Here it is. But... Your Highness, do go. The palace is far away, while you are without your fur coat and in such a frost. If mine fits you, please take it. You... are gifting me with your fur coat? Ah, such a warm fur coat. It suits you very well, Your Highness. Look, how alike we are. Yes. Oh, Your Highness, I must confess,... ...that it was she, who helped me to find the prettiest fir for you. And one more thing... You both are orphans. - Is that so? - Yes. Well, gentlemen, fare you well! Goodbye, dear Brother Months! Goodbye! Let's go!
