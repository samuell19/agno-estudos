[♪♪♪] [BOTH SNORING] Oh, a couple of sleeping beauties, eh? Come on, wake up. Come on, you slugs, get up! [WOLF WHISTLES] Where are the girls? Where'd they go? Now look, you termites, I was lucky to get this decorating job from the landlady. She'd have tossed us out on our skulls if I hadn't talked her into letting us pay our rent this way. Come on, get busy! All right, all right. Oh, we'll have your apartment fixed up in a jiffy, Mrs. Magruder. I hope so. These furnishings cost a pretty penny, you know. I wouldn't want anything to happen to them. No, we... [CLEARS THROAT] Now, don't worry, Mrs. Magruder. Just relax till it's a done. Will you be surprised. I hope so. Look at that rug! Why don't you watch what you're doing? Clean it up! All right, all right. Imbeciles. Always belting somebody. "Clean it up, clean it up." I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean it. It was an accident. Ah, shut up. What's the matter with you? [SPITS] I'll take your tonsils out one of these days. Hey, imbecile. Move the radio. Oh, move it. [LAUGHS] Stupid it, ain't he? Look who's talking. Get out of here [GRUNTS] [CRASHING] [RADIO PLAYING BIG BAND MUSIC] Out of the way. [ELECTRICITY ZAPPING] [SCREAMS] Mm! [GROANING] Get a bucket of water and we'll drown it. What'd he say? Get a bucket of water and we'll drown it! Get a bucket of water and we'll drown it! All right. Wait a minute. See if I can get the eighth race. Get away from here! Eighth race. I had a sure winner. Yeah, a 50-cent parlay player. Get away. [PIPES RUMBLING] What's going on here? Oh, yeah? A wise guy, huh? I'll fix you. That'll kill you for awhile. Oh, no, you ain't gonna get me this time. Oh, a wise guy. Oh! How do you like that? Oh, yeah? Moe, please forgive me. It was purely accidental, I assure you. Hm? [PIPES STOP RUMBLING] What do you know? It works. [LAUGHS] Yeah, it works. Ooh! Oh! Oh! Oh. [RADIO BABBLING] [WHEEZING] Help! Help! You got me. [GURGLING] Well, here we go again. Yeah, I wish that old battleax would have thrown us out before we did all that work. Shut up and finish packing. How come you give all the orders around here? Because I got all the brains around here. Any objections? Yeah... Objections overruled. You finished packing? Just these few things right here. That's... Wanna get it on the right side. We need those in there. Lock her up. All right. Wait a minute, you're getting no place. Let a guy do it that knows how. Spread out. Now, when I bounce it shut, you guys snap the lock. Right. Right. [BONES CRACK] Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Unlock it! Unlock it! What's the matter, Moe? Don't ask any foolish questions. Get the key. The key. Look out there, will you? Come on, will you? Where's the key? In the trunk. Come on, hurry up. Wait a minute, somebody threw a brick here, I think. I got it! I got it, Moe. I'll get you out in a minute. Okay. Wait a minute. It's got me too. Wait, grab him. I'll get it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, give it to me. Go ahead, a little harder. [MOE SCREAMS] [LOUD CRASH] [GROANING] Get it off. SHEMP: Alrighty, then. Give me your hand. I got you right there. Go ahead. Oh, a telegram. Thank you. Larry, a dime, ahem. Here you are, boy. Up. Get up there. The telegraph office is four blocks that way. Next time, ring the doorbell. It's from my Uncle Phineas. He's coming to visit me. He says he can stay two weeks. Oh, he can? Two whole weeks. But we're so broke we can't even feed ourselves. Let him go sponge on somebody else. Sure. Let him stay at a hotel. He can afford it. He's got 6 million bucks. Sure, why should we...? Six million bucks? And he's your uncle? Yes. We can't let our Uncle Phineas stay at a hotel. Certainly not. But you said... Never mind what I said. Our Uncle Phineas stays right here. But Moe, I... Haven't you got any family loyalty? Why shouldn't he stay here? Well, we were thrown out by the landlady, weren't we? Remember? That's right. I wonder if Uncle Phineas would like to sleep on a park bench. Wait a minute. Mrs. Magruder can't evict us at a time like this. We'll talk to the old battleax. We'll explain the situation to her. Go on. Oh, no. We're scared of her. MOE: Scared? Of a woman? I'll tell that biddy a thing or two or three. Now, where does she come off with that frog face? I'll tell her. Women! I tame 'em like k Buck tames tigers. Sometimes I'm kind to 'em, sometimes I crac e whip and make 'em jump. Listen, when I give her that sweet-talking stuff, she'l obably wind up giving me the apartment rent-free. But Moe, you... Oh, quiet. Charm. That's the ticket. Women swoon when I turn on the old personality. Stop waving. Women are romantic way down in here. Take Mrs. Magruder. You take her. You got her. You worm! You miserable creature. Wait a minute, Mrs. Magruder. Look, Shemp's uncle's coming here. Worth 6 million bucks. Ha! A likely story. Phineas Bowman. Mrs. Magruder, you want your back rent, don't you? Yeah, and if Uncle Phineas stays with Shemp, he'll probably make him his sole heir. Phineas Bowman. His sole heir. Shemp. All right, you can stay. But if you give me one more bit of trouble, out you go! Oh, no, Mrs. Battleax... What? No, no, Mrs. Biddy. No, they mean Mrs. Dragon. What? Magruder, I think... That is a battleax. Yeah, I was right. What'd you start it for? Wait a minute... You said deep down, deep down... Come on, already... You go in and clean up that bedroom. We want everything spic-and-span when Uncle Phineas gets here. Oh, why do I always have to clean up the bedroom? You were about to say? We want everything spic-and-span when Uncle Phineas get here. Right. Then get with it. [GRUMBLES] Oh! Let's see now. A teaspoonful of vanilla. Oh. Oh. Vanilla. [GROANS] You imbecile, don't you know how to open a bottle? Ow! [POPS] [SPITS] Now, you go on, mix another cake while I get cleaned up. [GROANING] Oh. Oh. Lucky for him that I was in the midst of making a cake. I'd fix him. Upside-down cake. Upside... [KNOCK AT DOOR] Oh, Uncle Phineas. Uncle Phineas, come right in. I was... Wait a minute, you're not Uncle Phineas. No, I'm not. I'm your new neighbor, Mrs. Duggan. I... I just moved in down the hall. Oh, hello. I was wondering if I could borrow a cup of sugar. Well, you know how it is when you move. You always forgot something. Oh, certainly, certainly. Follow me. Just follow me. Come on. Right in here. Duggan, Duggan. I know that name from somewhere. Well, you must have heard of my husband, Rocky Duggan? The big guy? That goes around tearing telephone books in half? That's right. He's the strongest man in the world. Oh, you think that's something? Feel this. Oh! Oh! Not so hard. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh! Oh. Oopsie-daisy. Oopsie-daisy. [GASPS, SCREAMS] Now look what you've done! Oh, I'm sorry, lady, I'm sorry. Oh! Hey! What's going on here? Oh, it was an accident, Larry. I'll pay for the dress. If my husband sees me like this, all you'll pay for is hospital bills. Oh, that's all right. I got insurance. [SIGHS] Oh, Moe, her husband tears telephone books in half. And people too. We better get her out of here. Fine going's on. Larry, get a robe. All right, any time you want to come in. I'll see if the coast is clear. Is he so high? Yes. And so wide? Yes. And has he got whiskers? Yes. [KNOCK ON DOOR] That's him. Hi, neighbors, I'm Rocky Duggan. [BONES CRACK] GROANS] Hi. I come down here looking for my missus. Yes, I know. I mean, I know all about you. You're the strongest man in the world. That's right. Want me to tear a telephone book for you? No, thanks. Never can tell when we need it. To call a doctor or something. Yeah. My missus said she was coming down here to borrow a cup of sugar. I guess maybe she changed her mind. Yeah, yeah, she changed her mind. Well, uh, I'll be seeing you, boys. Be seeing you. [MOANS] If my husband found me in here like this, there's no telling what he'd do. I beg your pardon, where is apartment 304? I'm looking for my nephew, Mr. Shemp Howard. Oh, 304, uh, right this way, sir. I... I just came from there. Oh. There you are, sir. Right there. Thank you. [KNOCKING] [GASPS] Who's there? Phineas Bowman. Uncle Phineas! Oh, my boy! I'm so happy to see you. I... Uh... Oh! How do you do? Meet chrome dome. PHINEAS: How do you do, Mr. Chrome Dome? [KNOCKING] Oh, that's the luggage man. I'll get it. Oh. You home-wreckers. I'm gonna tear you limb from limb. SHEMP: Ow! Wait, take it easy. Take it easy. SHEMP: Come on, Moe, Larry! What is the meaning of this...? [BONES CRACK] Oh! [SCREAMS] Hey. [WHISTLES] Whoa! Nephew! SHEMP: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa! Oh! Nephew? Why...? The bigger they are, the harder they fall. [LAUGHING] Oh! Oh... Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh... Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh! Oh! Oh... Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! [BONES CRACK] Oh! [GRUNTING] Oh, oh, oh! [GIBBERING] [CHOKING] [BONES CRACK] Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Get... [SCREAMS] [BONES CRACK] Leave him alone! Who says so? I do. Beat it, lady. No dame's gonna tell me what to do. Oh, Rocky, you dope. This whole thing was a silly mistake. Mistake? Look at the choppers. Look at my choppers. Where's your uncle? In there. Look at this! Look at this! My act is ruined. How am I gonna pull that loaded freight car with my teeth when all my teeth are gone? I'll pay for some new ones, honest. With what? Shemp's gonna be rich. Yeah. His uncle's in there. He's got 6 million bucks. And Shemp is his sole heir. Nephew, this is wonderful. [CHUCKLING] Wonderful! I want you to meet the future Mrs. Bowman. We were childhood sweethearts. She's the only woman I ever cared for. Oh, Phineas. [GIGGLING] You're so sweet. There goes our 6 million bucks. There goes our share. There goes our oil wells. There goes my teeth! [ALL SCREAM] Rocky, don't do it! SHEMP: Oh! [ALL SCREAMING] Oh, Phineas. All I wanted was a nice, quiet visit. Oh. [♪♪♪]
