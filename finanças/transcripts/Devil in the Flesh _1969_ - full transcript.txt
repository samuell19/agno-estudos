- Good morning, Severin. - Good Morning. - Constantly at your books? - Oh, that's enough for this morning. - Anyway, that's what I'm here for. - But you said you came here to rest. Indeed, people, but you see for me writing is not work. What's more, I even find it relaxing. I find taking these therapeutic walks along the lake-side much more tiring. - What a sense of humour! - Even fishing is work to me. - Now you're exaggerating. - Fraulein Helga. - Oh, pardon me! But I must go welcome our new guest. - Of course. - How are you, Mrs Dunajew? - Fine. - Show you around? - Please. - Did you have a good trip? - Yes, thank you. I hope you like it here. The whole place is vast. I'm sure you’ll enjoy it. I love privacy. Woolf, Woolf, come, come! Good dog! Show Miss Dunajew to room 172. - Thank you. - See you later. - A beautiful girl, eh? - Do you know her? Photographer's model, Wanda von Dunajew. Oh, move the picture to get to know her better, maybe? Yes... I remember now... when I was a child. What was it Freud said? "That man is the sum total of traumas of his childhood." Catalina, the maid... I was fascinated at seeing her and the chauffeur making love. A woman in furs is somehow more exciting and erotic, than otherwise dressed or undressed, not only for the senses, but for the imagination. It is from this source that pleasure radiates and draws its nutrition. A pleasure that can can be so great it is painful. This is the ecstasy. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - Your table's here. - Thank you. How lovely to have breakfast here in the garden. - Yes. Coffee? Will you excuse me for a moment. - Of course. Come. - Fraulein, bitte! - Excuse me. - Hello! - Hello! How long have you been here? - I love the privacy. - So do I. Turn off the light. Watching them sent a strange feeling through me. A feeling I could never quite define, a voluptuousness... of pain. What are you doing? Don't cry, Severin. Come here... there, there. That's love. Those tears... so sweet. They seemed to have conditioned my whole life. In this pain, my pain... I found chasteness and joy. The blood surged in my veins. I felt dizzy. All reason left me. Everything began to spin. To spin... to spin... to spin... to spin. It's a beautiful statue, but you are much more beautiful. Have you ever seen me like that? I don't remember. I would like to go to bed with you. It's something I'm asked frequently... but never so bluntly. So now we can discover if you prefer frankness or hypocrisy. Perhaps I should be shocked. That's not an answer. All I can do is to offer to have lunch with you. You are inviting me to have lunch with you today, aren't you? I've always wanted to meet a romantic man... just for a change. And I think all things considered... he's the most foolish of all. If deep pleasure is born most of all from suffering... then I think this is the woman of whom I've always dreamed. I don't believe in eternal love. I've never been faithful to one man for more than a month. In love there are only masters and slaves. Those who dominate and those who are dominated. - That's when I was a stripteaser. - You're fantastic. That was a Tartar Queen number. It was always a big success. Show me that number. Beautiful! Oh, I'm sorry! Did I hurt you? I hurt you. I hurt you. Do it again. Go on! Whip me! My flesh burns, but the pain gives me such infinite pleasure. - Are you happy? - Yes. You? You're asking me? I'm only afraid you'll eventually get bored. Don't even think about it. You know? It is very difficult to act as a prostitute, when one's in love. I know incredible secrets about you. Shall we talk about room 173? Then you know that I... Yes, and I like the feeling I was being watched. It was like being on stage. And the night you let the gardener in, did you know I was watching you? Yes, I knew it. And I put everything I had into the part I was playing. I went through hell. But it was then I realised I wanted you. You did? I want you... to make me suffer. You're all the same, you men. When you love a woman, you want to lock her up in the most secret cell of the pyramid of Keops. How wrong you are. I'd be the first to say go... seek pleasure, because the pleasure I'll see you find is mine too. I believe frustrations are born of the monotony, that come from faithfulness in love. I must develop that thought in my book. You see? It's true. I'm unfaithful by nature. And yet, I don't think I'd be capable of doing what you ask. To my way of thinking, faithfulness has nothing to do with it. At least, not in the traditional sense of the word. Now, the problem's a much deeper one. It's that of making the sexual relationship less monotonous. Otherwise, it's destined to wither. Do you think I'd be capable of betraying a man... under his very eyes? And if I asked you myself? You're strange. With you a woman feels drawn towards corruption... towards cruelty... towards going beyond all limits. You are my mistress... I am your slave. Wanda, would you marry a man like me? I've always thought that marriage was... lost too. That's an outdated and melodramatic expression. Let's say it would mean the end of sex. That depends. You see, in applying my theories, the so-called matrimonial relationship would be different. Enough for today, huh? - Hello, Severin. How are you? - Fine thanks. - You're looking well. - Thank you. I would like you to meet someone. - Wanda. - Joshua. - How are you? - It's a pleasure. - What are you doing now? - Nothing. Come with me. I'll show you something very interesting. - Concerning what? - Perhaps it's not a sight for a woman. Then it must be really exciting. Women are always forbidden the most amusing things. In that case, let's go! I'm very happy when others desire you. - You really aren't jealous? - No, not as long as I'm part of the game. Then there's only pleasure for you when I provoke other men while you watch. Oh, how sweet! Is that all? Why did they take the colt away? Just wait my dear and you'll see. The stallion's energy is very precious. So as not to waste it, we let the colt excite the mare. - It went well this morning? - It's a good spot. I'm not complaining. - Do you like to fish too? - Sometimes. - What's your name? - Andrea miss. - How old are you? - I'm 20. Do you really want me to do this? You promised. Go on! You're right. I feel I'm yours all the more. I knew it. Wanda, will you marry me? Yes.Yes, because I want to betray you and bring you to desperation. I will make you unhappy. You'll see. Be cruel, be cruel as nature is cruel, destroying that what is has created. Be as cruel as that and I will be unhappy. - How do I look? - Wonderful, absolutely wonderful. It's the most magnificent wedding gift you could have given me. Tell me why furs are so fascinating, for you as well as me? Because it is the attire of women and kings, the symbol of power and femininity. To me, it is the only garment worthy of a women... because it exalts her animal instincts and increases her desire. I also have another gift for you. "Beloved Wanda, I am afflicted of a terrible disease, "but more than death itself, I feel the suffering. "For this reason I have decided to put an end to my life. "Remember me with love always. Yours, Severin." What do you mean? Are you really that ill? No. I said it's a gift to you. I'm giving you an alibi... in case something happens. I don't understand. I want no limits... to your cruelty. So, that if you decided to kill me... - this note might be useful to you. - You frighten me at times. You unleash in me... uncontrollable instincts. The though has occurred to me that I would be happy to make you suffer... to the point of agony. That's what I want... to lose all in a vision A ruthless tiger resides in every woman. I want to unleash it. Will she live up to my expectations as a wife? Dominate me as a queen... without violence, without vulgarity. What could he be thinking about? I hope he's happy with me. Such happiness as this almost makes me unhappy. Here we were to spend our honeymoon in a villa on the Costa Brava. A beautiful Renaissance construction isolated by the sea, surrounded by wild primitive countryside. The perfect place for our kind of happiness. It's magnificent. You're wonderful, darling. It's beautiful! Wait. That's not all. - Do you like it? - When I need you, I'll sound the gong. That's a wonderful idea. I'd like to be treated... just like an oriental slave. Of course, it's just part of your game. We have been living in Spain for over a year now. These are our references, madam. As you see, my friend and I have always worked together. Good. My husband and I will be here for three months. - This is your room. - How lovely! We will be comfortable here. Thank you. Oh God! Do you know what I thought? Since I'm your servant, I should be living here... on the servant's floor. - Wouldn't madam be needing a majordomo? - No, not a majordomo. But I could use a chauffeur. A chauffeur! Wonderful. I will be silent and faithful. I'll follow you like a shadow does. Good. I'll try you for eight days. Then I will decide. One moment! Does it seem dignified that a woman just married should allow her chauffeur such liberties? If it's not the chauffeur, it's her husband's friend. - Or a partner in business? - You're right. That's you privilege. Perfect! - Do you like it? - Yes. - I'm afraid we're shocking them, madam. - It excites me to think about what... they must be thinking. Madam, your car's this way. Now we'll find a suitable name and the transformation will be complete. - Well, you can call me Gregor. - Alright. I know you are and will remain a married woman. A lady who gives into caprice every once in a while. Just sound the gong. Each day Wanda seems more beautiful to me. But what is a woman's beauty compared with her cruelty? Better you go to sleep. Sometimes women are whores uselessly, and the vulgar side of this is it's useless. No! No, no. No. Forgive me. Forgive me. I'm so sorry. You called madam? - Gregor is the car ready? - Of course, madam. Then hurry. I must be in Cadaqués in ten minutes. And what are you going to do in Cadaqués? Whatever I please. I'm not required to answer you. Pardon me, madam. Glad you made it. Why did she meet him? She didn't tell me anything. Why? Who is he? She mustn't shut me out completely. You should include me in everything, according to our agreement. She's been in there for more than an hour now. I hope it'll be soon. Yes. Bye. Home, Gregor. It's late. Who's that man? Why did you stay so long in his house? So, I found a way to make you jealous. What happened to all your precious theories? - Your objective theories?. - What's that got to do with it? You're free, but you mustn't have secrets from me. Your freedom and vices must be my freedom and vices... if we really love one other. You understand this? All I can say is that after only two months, you've become like any other husband. Don't talk nonsense. I wasn't forbidding you anything, but you've no right to exclude me from your life. - Why don't you admit that we've both made a big mistake? - And why don't you remember our agreement? I remember, I remember. But if you want to know the truth, I'm finding all this more and more ridiculous each day. Just remember you are ruining everything. But I only wanted to give you a surprise. - Who is he? - He's a painter. I wanted to give you a portrait of me. I'm sorry, Wanda. Why don't you have him come here? Oh, it's very good work! - Thank you. - Yes, beautiful. Go on! - In front of him? - Yes, he won't bother us. See another man with her made me suffer. I feel a terrible pain pounding at my temples. And yet, she is so beautiful. His skin is so translucent, that you can see the delicate little veins just under the surface. Her firm breasts rise and fall. Her soft arms touch savagely at his convulsing body. I know that vulgarity will soon flower in her. She's mine! She's mine! In will and spirit she's mine! I have never suffered so much. Don't touch me! What do you feel when you see me in someone else's arms? I suffer... I suffer yet I am happy that I like it. No man could go through what you do. - No one could admit... - You're too beautiful to belong to just one man. I'm tired of your insanity! Get out. Get out! What's wrong with you, Wanda? - Wanda! - I hate you! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! I hate you! Get out! Out! Get out! Out! Get out! Get out! Do you feel better now? He has a fever. He feels bad. Gregor. Stop him. He's fabulous. Faster, I say. Faster. Faster! Faster, stop him. Catch him. Stop him. He's fabulous. Faster! Faster! Faster! He's stopped. Go get him. Go on! This is Wanda... this is Bruno. Take the first point off you come to and stop in a deserted spot. Get out and keep you distance. I said get out and turn on the radio! I said get out! Get out of here! He's already been here for four days. I've had enough. - You've got to send him away. - I wouldn't think of it. And besides, didn't you ask me to make you suffer? You're ruining everything. Do you realise that? I realise that your theories are failures. Anyway, it's no fault of mine. - Wanda, please. - You've annoyed me! Go away. Disappear! I'll show you how to respect a lady. What's the matter with him? Has he gone crazy. Oh, he's just jealous. Oh, I get it! He went to bed with you, right? And now he's uptight that you're ignoring him. You better split man, before something worse happens to you. Come on, baby! Come on! I don't want this creep around here anymore. You must get rid of him! I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. I have every right to stay. What's he talking about? - May I present my husband. - What? My husband. That's how he gets his pleasure. He's a degenerate. He wouldn't leave, even if you whipped him, Indeed, he'd even like it. What'll I do? Do you have to think about it? Kick the fool out. Good. Hit him again! Harder. Harder! Good. Hit him again! Beautiful! You're mine, you're mine and no one else's. I have loved you as no other man has loved a woman. Do I no longer mean anything to you? That brute has completely overwhelmed you. You have wounded me and continue to wound me as with claws tearing at my flesh. Is this how you compensate me for my adoration? I can't bear it any longer, it's vulgar. Vulgar. Maybe my dream is absurd. I'm looking for perfection, but does it exist? I am alone. I must resign myself to being noble... to cold banal normality, like an ordinary man, like any other man. "I know not why I'm sad "A maid of unearthly beauty sits on high, combing her tresses "Her golden hair with a golden comb, she combs "Singing a sweet and haunting air. I know not why I'm sad." Love does not unite a man and a woman, it separates them... turning them into implacable enemies. There is no truce in the war between the sexes: only winners and losers... masters and slaves. You're a fool, a degenerate. You and your demented theories. I don't ever want to see you again. Never! Never! Never! Degenerate! Degenerate! Degenerate! Idiot! Stupid! Exhibitionist! You nearly ruined a new uniform. Do you think you can move me... to change my mind? I know you by now and I know your cowardice. I was desperate. Then why did you come back? - I came back, to wait for the right moment. - What moment? To wait for the moment when he will start to treat you the way I was treated. He's a real man, not like you - You're a bitch. - What did you say? You're a bitch! You're the bitch! Give me a Bloody Mary! No! No! No! Why do you humiliate me like this? You'll stay here and watch us as you demanded of your husband. Your wife still hasn't understood how things are. Would you like a drink? No! Look at what your Queen of Hearts has come to. No! No! No! What are you doing? - It's obvious. I'm packing. - Are you leaving? Alone? Yes, alone. - How much, sir? - Fill it up. Hey, sir! Want make love? He's too much of an aristocrat for us. Wouldn't you like to have a little fun? Business is sure bad today, girls. Want something? Only the Greeks came to understand the true social function of prostitutes. - They treated them with respect. - Rosita, come here. - What's your name? - Paulie. Why dare you staring at me like that? Were you in love with her? Well, are we gonna have some fun. Let's go! Not that I don't trust you, but let's see your money first. That's a lot of money. Got any particular habit? Bye! Paulie is such a whore. Nice here! Are you gonna to get undressed or you gonna make love like that? What's your name? Call me Bruno. Why do you keep staring at me? What are you thinking? I said get out! I said get out of here! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! No! No! Hey! Man! Stop! - Are you crazy? - Quiet! What's going on? - He was strangling her. - Right, take him out of here. No, no. I provoked him. - I started it. - You can't stay alone with him. It's alright. He's my friend. You may go, you may go. It's alright. Very well, you'll stay here at your own risk. Women! Women are all alike. I'll never understand them. For a second I thought who wanted to kill me. It was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. I want to be your woman. I'll give you all my earnings... every last cent. Who are you? Tell me. Is it true you are a bitch? Come on, tell me! Tell me! Yes, I'm a bitch. Yes, a bitch. Say who I am! Master; my master. Are you willing to do everything you ask? Yes. Yes. Yes! Can you guess what I want you to do? Yes. Yes. Yes.
