Reconquista in g "go! Core fighter" Baldies from the amerian army. Trying to invade the capital tower's airspace to take the mysterious mobile suit? You're just a makeshift militia. Breaking the sound barrier? I can take it. Did the baldy one catch the mysterious mobile suit? Wait up. What's that glow? I'll try to catch it! Did something fall? Kerbes, the mysterious mobile suit's backpack. Recover it. Imonit darn. I can't just throw her away. All right. As your first practical lesson, you alone, as capital guard cadets can repair the umbilical cable. - Go over there. - Sorry. - Why did you dodge? - Yes. You're always telling us to respond flexibly to the situation, captain. What are you smiling for? Bell skipped two grades. I'd expect no less from him. Inspect and attach your backpacks! Guys! - Hello. - Hi. Hey, there. Congratulations! First practical space training! Manny came too! Hey. Is that a harobe? Hurray! Hurray! Bellri. Luin, you do your best. =I will. St. flower academy girls, get out! - Come on, girls! - Bell, do your best! Go for it! Catch those girls! Instructor, they're just here to cheer us on. Even our best student says that? Have some consideration for the guys without girlfriends. Even if you're the operations director's kid, doesn't mean you can drag kuntala girls aboard. I didn't call them here. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! 1010th class! Run for the crown's operating room! - Everyone! - Capital guard! Those cheerleaders are headed your way. Huh? Roger that. Everyone, back to your seats. Check your equipment. Go back and check your life support equipment! - Air and water pellets, check! - Check! Mmf functioning properly! There's a lot of sprites today... Sprites? You're not a student, are you? Who are you? Raraiya... Monday. Not again. You're not allowed to cheer them on during practical training! This girl is under capital army supervision. Capital army? Supervision? What's with that? Don't ask! Kuntala! - You kicked her! - It's the under nut. Passing through under nut. The nut we just passed is the under nut. This poor nut is not counted among the 144 nuts of the capital tower. Anyone knows why? - Torriti. - Sir. It was a satellite for clearing debris before the capital tower was constructed. Even in low orbit, the cables and nuts move in sync with earth's rotation. Why is that? Hey! Weren't you listening? Because of the minovsky magnet-ray field, or mmf, effect produced between the cables and nuts. And... Enough. What's its energy source? The cables absorb the electricity generated by the airglow belt in the earth's upper atmosphere. Correct. What's our present altitude? Luin Lee! 365 kilometers. Correct. Radar is useless once minovsky particles are spread around! Yes, sir! Gloves on! Don't cry! - Is this harobe yours? - Yes. No need for a kuntala to have one. It's a necessity for environmental checking. It's called nobell. Listen! You've got to stop this future husband search of yours. It's a tradition at Saint flower academy. We've been saving to buy these tickets since we entered the academy. What's the capital army? Is it different from the capital guard? Arriving at the first nut. Our tickets are good until the next nut. - This way. - Right. After I went to the trouble of catching her in midair... She doesn't seem to feel a thing. She's from ameria or gondwan. She can't be from towasanga, right? Of course not. I've never seen the type of mobile suit she came down in. Treat her well. Pressurizing for minovsky flight. One, two, three. Good. Mmf orientation, good. Route is clear. Fight! Fight! Okay! All teams, board rectens! Once you've made your first movement, switch places with the next student. Why me? It's in order of age, so you're first. Ah! Right! No way. Why is the cockpit facing outside? Practical training is a form of hazing. This is to teach the skills needed fo adapt fo space. Yes, sir! Hurry up and board. Yes, sir! Those girls are in the driver's seat. For my first movement... Bellri, youre slow. Right. Raise both arms and move. Test the full movement of the arms... Minovsky, you say? They're here? Those aren't capital guard machines... Pirates! Once minovsky particles are spread, we can only use wired communications. Pirates? The rumored space pirates? That's not a recten's silhouette. What? - Nice! - Just one machine?! That's not a pirate mobile suit! What? Students in the rectens, don't move! Let them think they re unmanned. It's aiming its rifle! Connect g! G/ what? Don't use a contact link either. - Then... - Cut your camera. - Come on... - A murderer like you... I can't move? Who's that girl with noredo? 1 have taken this crown hostage. Twill release it in 20 minutes. You may communicate that information to the capital tower control. - And if we refuse? - What happens? Use your imagination. I won't sever the cable or anything like that She's not here? That recten should be torriti's. We've barely got weapons. - Torriti"s recten got taken out! - Environment! Check! - It landed on us! - We're ascending! That's not torriti. This girl is responding to it. Has her memory returned? - G... - Hey! Raraiya Monday, right? Raraiya? Each has three charges of gunpowder for emergencies. They're usable as weapons. Or that! If they want a fight...! I won't let you shoot! Even if you use the crown as a shield...! The world is not square! That was... A woman's voice? Whose recten is that? Isn't it bell's? He's being too reckless! G! Everyone, put on space suits. No telling when we might be thrown out! Dellensen, heading out. - Who are you? - Luin Lee. From behind you. Attaching big arm and power weld. The descending crown has been occupied by pirates. Go back to the crown! If you leave the mmf field, you'll be pulled down by earth. Returning to the crown. Luin Lee, taking off. Instructor dellensen. That's the same mobile suit that dropped raraiya Monday. What? A beam saber? What? Su-cord! There are explosives set in our backpacks. If you resist, we'll destroy your engine. You hear me, woman? What? Cut that out! Stop it! - G! - What are you doing? What's with her? A prisoner captured by captain dellensen. So she's the girl who the capital army brought from space? I don't know. Are you? This girl's in bad shape. What's going on? Is that the pirate? Time-wise, Cahill's team which occupied the descending crown should have retrieved the photon batteries by now. But because 1 get like this sometimes... Please move to the crown. Your hatch conforms fo universal standards? Don't act so familiar! Did you say something? No. There was something wrong with this machine today. Bell returns alive! Hey. Thank you. Good work. The cockpit is on the upper floor. Right. - Bell! - G! G! Is it really just her? She came alone. No support. You were planning to withdraw five minutes after the guys attacking the crown below. If your rectens hadn't gotten in the way... Don't give me that nonsense! You knock around my precious student, torriti, and... My aim is precise. I didn't make him explode. A competent pilot would be able to return to the crown on his own. What? The way she talks isn't cute. Name and rank in the amerian army? I am not a member of the military. Only the military uses mobile suits. Name and rank? Aida rayhunton. Space pirate. You just stuck two names together! Your machine is the one that came down here a week ago, isn't it? I invoke the right to refuse. A pirate's in no position to demand rights! It's because of feelings like yours that people kill each other. Instructor. This pilot has shut her hatch. It won't open. The g-self's... that machine's hatch can't be opened by anyone but me. Thankee. Not at all. Luin. - No way! - Don't you move. - G! - Don't keep her here. - Y-yes, sir. - And you guys. Yes. Gis...! No! Come on, you're all right. Let that girl rest. - Let's go, Manny. - Okay. Please do. Rayhunton code. Confirmed. What? The same shape? Has he got the starter on? That's absurd! These all conform to universal standards. We'll transfer to the descending crown at hiyaan, the second nut. Try moving it. Yes! You re loading this on the descending crown foo? - Don't make her cry. - I know. - Noredo. - Sorry. Because the umbilical cord connecting space and earth is sound, the land is blessed. Because of the sacred taboo, people can live out their lives in eternal tranquility. Open your hearts wide to the heavens. For it is the heavens that bestow upon us... So, the pilot captured by the capital army is raraiya Monday. And the machine she piloted was being used by a pilot calling herself aida rayhunton? Yes, sir! The space pirate says that machine is the g-self, but captain dellensen says she's making it all up. Yes, sir. Perhaps it's all a coincidence. This isn't the sort of thing someone could plan out in advance. Yay! It's lunch break! - You can run, right? - Yes. The new capital army is looking into it. Our port's hangar 25, is the place to go. Huh? That's the lab the capital guard uses too. Bellri, you're the operations director's son and you don't know? Well, the academy and capital guard use the same facilities. The new capital army doesn't have its own research division yet. That's why the army hid it in hangar 25 to study it. What for? Even though they know the suit that pirate was piloting isn't from ameria, they still can't operate it. You beat the pirate! You're great! Oh, thank you! Huh? That girl... The girl on the crown. Step, step. She's a cheerleader now? What's with the capital army's supervision? - Look. - Nobell's doing it too. They took them out! Manny, what's going on with her? She's been admitted to our class. At least until her memory returns. Is she a kuntala? She's in good health, but can't say where she's from. - She looks good. - Cut that out! Raraiya Monday isn't her real name? They call her Monday because that's when she was found. The capital army guys on the crown. Luin Lee, bellri zenam. Report fo the principal's office at once. You all take good care of her. No touching! Bellri, go see luin at the opera house. So, those are the capital army's catsiths? That's right. It's a catsith, but it has wings... Luin, sorry I'm late. No need for anymore outside work. - I know you. - Huh? You want to go save the lady pirate in prisoner's tower, don't you? Wha... I'm not that crazy! You've been hauled out. Keep up the good work. Colonel cumpa rusita has arrived. - Oh, colonel. - Good evening. Ah, bellri. I hear that your son captured a pirate mobile suit. Impressive. He just hates losing and is quick to act. Is that right? I'm trying to live up to my mother's expectations. It would seem your disposition has a negative effect on your son, director. Oh, stop joking. He's a colonel in the research division, but he's the mastermind that created the capital army. I hear nobody knows where he's from. Salute! His holiness has already arrived! It's been so long, your holiness. Please, be seated. Ah, the operations director has come. Why are you here this early? We wanted to see the fireworks here. That's kind of you to say. La, la, la, la, la! Yes! This is cumpa rusita. Be courteous with our guests from the izanellian continent, understood? Yes, sir. The research division only offers advice on world affairs. Are those minovsky particles? Space pirates are coming? Nothing but static! Nobell, you be quiet! What does it mean? It's that, don't you think? - Huh? - What? - It's an air raid! - They're bombing us! Call in the capital army! The rectens won't do it. They only have maintenance equipment. - Raraiya! - You okay? - Raraiya! - Get on! Prisoner's tower or hangar 25?! Of course! - Luin! - Bell! Ow, ow, ow... G! You girls head home! What? We're going to hangar 25, aren't we? Didn't you realize that they're targeting prisoner's tower? What are you planning to do about the canal? Those guys... If bellri and luin can do it... What? I'll do this with girl power! Luin, isn't it dangerous over there? They haven't gotten out yet? If so... What about that woman? What? What? Take on the pirates in rectens? Bell, stop this! I'll go! Aida rayhunton! Answer me! Woah! Don't get distracted by some woman! Kill the lights. You're on duty, stay at your post! You're already late! Aren't they amerian mobile suits? I thought they were space pirates. Move forward more. Crouch down. They haven't said a thing, so quit the idle speculation! Are there any wounded? This way? - What are they doing?! - Ah, this way. - Bell! - Army hq hasn't given us orders! Bell! The stairs just stop? - Bell. - They made it into a maze. There are private rooms! What? There's a stick of light. No way! A beam saber? Those guys...! There's still more stairs up! - It goes down from here! - Bellri zenam! - Huh? - What is it? Huh?! Please, don't move! Stop that! Ow! Don't stick your butt out! You're nuts! Ow! You hit me hard on purpose! This is hunting slingshot ammo. If I'd used it seriously, I'd have shot a hole in your butt! Why do you know my name? You're the grade skipper who activated the g-self. I heard about you from the investigators. You called them here, didn't you? They stripped me of everything 1 had. How could I? Why is someone like you... Resorting to space piracy? We ought to be covering the earth with solar panels, but the capital forbids it. That's dictatorial! Because earth... That's why! You... You slapped bell! You slapped him! We're getting out of here! They're after her! Luin! Before the attack, we received a transmission demanding your return! I knew I could count on him! Captain Cahill came for me! Come on! Space pirates get the death penalty! Luin, they say they're getting a boat out for us. Really? Good work! What's the boat for? You want to go to hangar 25, right? You're going to the mobile suit? How did you know? Manny! That was careless! We can't cross this bridge! It's collapsed. What? - Let's cross! - What? What's that? Instructor kerbes? What is this? We're moving you to hangar 25. Thank you. Instructor dellensen wants bellri to move the pirate mobile suit. Okay, do it! - Luin! - Manny! I'm gonna fall! The capital army still can't move that thing. We're letting it go? Right. There are civilians aboard. Th-that's miss aida's Iris sign! This boy... There are two Iris signs? Miss aida, what does this mean? - It's hangar 25! - Yes, sir! Enemies approaching! That one's tenacious! Why is there nobody here? - Nobell's with you too? - Is this the place? That girl! They call it an army, but it's a makeshift organization. - Huh? - What is it? It looks the same as when I got out of it. It's the g-self. Why? Because that's the name I gave it. The hatch is still open too. Luin, start up the engine on that barge! Yes, sir! Bellri, get that thing moving! Yes, sir! This boy! Captain, I'm going this way. Fine. I'l check here. That woman! - They're here. - Raraiya? Bellri! Shove her off! I can't shove her off! The g-self... I'm going to move it. I can make it! I won't let you... Touch it! I can move it too, you know! A collection of classics from the previous era? Rayhunton code confirmed, it seems to be fine. Now for the backpack... Universal multi-contact setup. When this recording played, I was thrown out. He moved it even though captain Cahill or klim Nick couldn't Giovanni, you handle the next one over. Yes, sir, captain Cahill! Luin, won't we stand out if we go out there? We're going to be found either way. The minovsky particles are getting in the way again! Is the girl in your custody able to speak yet? She hasn't spoken. She hasn't spoken. Right? Someone... Why would a backpack you installed here work? It's all built to universal standards. Of course it would work. Cahill! Where are you? That's the g-self, isn't it? Aida! Princess' Cahill! Miss aida doesn't move it like that with a backpack. Bell! The g-self... You'd beat your own comrade to death?! Princess! We're all done here. Yes, I'll look into it. Raraiya, don't run! - Nobell, watch her. - Roger. Give him back! Revive captain Cahill and give him back to me! You've killed a man you shouldn't have killed! I didn't mean to... The captain was a man who could have led the amerian army! He was passionate, yet gentle. He was a wonderful adult! What's that girl's problem? There's no way bell would kill anyone. Yeah, and it's their own fault for attacking us. Pa... pa! 2=s it was just one shot. The insides are totally fried. Bell says he did it while protecting her. And that's what he gets for it? Return that cockpit to the way it was. And bring Cahill back to life! You were able to fight Cahill. You should be able to do that much, right?! Bellri zenam! Th-that's just not possible. Yes, I read you, captain dellensen. Please, head here straight away. Bigwigs from the research division are coming? Colonel cumpa and the others will come by boat. We arranged for it because you wouldn't. - You okay? - I'm fine. Bellri, you managed to save that woman. You may have saved this girl too. Good work out there tonight. Sorry for the trouble, but come to the research division again tomorrow. Y-yes, sir. Pardon me. The research division will take that thing and the woman! This treatment is in violation of international law! I thought you said you weren't with the amerian army? Then it's not a violation. Ah, colonel! We're investigating that suit. But even after a week, the capital army couldn't move it. The research division will handle it now. But you're the one behind the capital army! - Captain Becker. - What is it? This is the student I was telling you about, cadet luin Lee. I hear you're a kuntala. Is that really so repulsive? People hate you because you talk like that. You both dodged and blocked it, huh? I'd say you're a promising cadet. Thank you. The capital army...? - Tll see you tomorrow. - Yes, sir. Thank you for the shank. - Bell! - Yeah... Noredo, you go home and get some sleep. Your holiness? I'll have them keep up the capital tower's operations. Do so. - Why, if it isn't miss noredo nug. - Yes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I hear that you piloted a pirate mobile suit again? Yes, I did. The research division spies on foreign taboo-breakers. Why would they take away the lady pirate? Who is this girl? She's a St. flower academy cheerleader. Miss noredo nug, yes? Could you use your power to get that girl back? The prisoner? Why? Bell fell in love at first sight. Love at first sight! Love at first sight! A harobe? Is it yours, noredo? Its name is nobell. I'm planning to give it to bellri when he gets into the capital guard. I see. Bellri managed fo pilot it even colonel cumpa would have to listen to you, mom. Your hand... was it bleeding? It doesn't hurt anymore. We mustn't let it get infected. - Hey! - Right away. That's one long formation. Oh, give me a break! The lady pirate is older than you, bellri. I'm just concerned with that mobile suit and colonel cumpa. - You liar! - You liar! I'm not lying! When that woman grabbed you by the lapels, sobbing, you thought what she said was right, didn't you? When you saw her off, you'd fallen in love, hadn't you? Shut up! Why here so early in the morning? I'm bellri zenam. The colonel summoned me here. - Bellri? The cadet? - Yes. Hey. I've had that with me since I was born. An amulet? This was your only possession we could get back from the capital army. Thank you very much. Raraiya Monday! There's nothing to be afraid of it seems she acts like that occasionally when left alone. Though you claim to be a pirate, we have evidence you're an independent unit recognized by the amerian army. Your backpack had an amerian domestic producer's plates and seal. What? Bellri zenam says he's come here for his questioning. Bellri? - Let him through. - Yes, sir! A second attack with this timing. The capital army would never expect it. - Lower altitude. - It1l be shaky. That doesn't matter. Strange there's a mecha factory in the research division too. You're right. Good morning. - Good morning! - Morning! Does time mean nothing to you when you get an idea in your head? What has she said about that mobile suit? The investigation hasn't started. - Bell's in love with her. - Noredo! Was it love at first sight? Captain dellensen said that suit came down from space... You murderer! You guys attacked and made me use that high-performance machine. That doesn't mean... Bell! - Noredo. - What's wrong? Nore... noredo! Dispersing minovsky particles. You know the rendezvous point? Ilgot it klim Nick, montero, separating! She fell asleep after drinking this. Oh. That's what happens in battle. The fact remains that you killed him. There were deaths on our side as well. You don't know how much damage was done around the capital tower. Captain Cahill was...! He wanted to end the capital tower's monopoly over earth's energy. The distribution of photon batteries is controlled by the su-cordists to prevent the mistakes of the universal century. If energy and tools are used ethically... You couldn't do that, and that's why you used the mobile suit. Captain Cahill was... A man who could have become a god, perhaps? No... that's taking it too far. I understand what you're saying about the ethical use of tools. That's why I wanted to ask both of you. Miss aida, you and bellri were able to pilot the g-self. Raraiya Monday was as well. Wh-what?! A siren? - Everyone! - An air raid?! Sir! Before dispersing minovsky particles, he asked for the prisoner? It's that elevator. Your friends have come to pick you up, huh? The captain wasn't my only comrade. Ow! - What is it? - What? The colonel said we could reach the cockpit from the third floor. - Do you believe him? - He's testing us. Because he's a member of the research division. Stuck. That was reckless. It stopped. The colonel is over there. Slow reaction... - Rayhunton code accepled. - Don't. It reacted to something. Huh? It's the starter. Some of my pirate comrades want to use me. Bellri zenam, check the face. Huh? Sure! Ah, the eyes are lit up. Captain dellensen, is this really okay? We'll have to make do with what we've got! I'm taking us out! Get going! Darn! Klim Nick is here, Princess! Come on... move! - Stop! - The army's on the move too! I'm going back where I belong! It didn't move at all before now! There are four people aboard? Oh, director wil. What does his holiness want? The g-self is in the process of being stolen. Do this more quietly! Can you see what's in front? You... That's klim Nick, all right. - What's that? - A montero. Its javelin has a beam wire function! I won't let it fight at the capital tower! Increase our altitude! This is how you use a javelin! Oh no! Some javelin! That's the machine we saw last night! It's probably Mr. kerbes, right? - Look! - What? We have fire extinguishers! Is that bellri? What's going on? Level your machine. Who's piloting?! Landing gear! Wheels! Wheels! - Step on the brakes! - Kerbes! I get it! Wh-what's going on? It's fast! I've got you! Is that you, cadet bellri? Princess! Miss aida! Klim Nick has come for you... Princess! Why do you stop me? An amateur attack like that won't hit! Let's go back to the megafauna. Klim Nick! What do you mean go back?! Go back where? The pirate ship megafauna. This woman... Oh, director. Yes, the enemy has retreated. They must have fled. Given what ameria has done, we'll suspend their supply of photon batteries as punishment. I understand how you feel. I did tell you that there were four people aboard the g-self, right? Yes, the prisoner, raraiya Monday, who was under supervision, as well as noredo nug. What? My son?! You haven't damaged so much as one wire of the capital tower, have you? But of course. That's going fo be the amerian army's space base. - Space base? - What's he talking about? He's such an easygoing young man, even though he's the president's son. He's a mobile suit lover. So she is amerian army. What are they plotting while they re fighting gondwan? What is this? Feels like diarrhea. So we're riding on that? Princess, can you grab the grip? Yes. What? You can't hold it in? I'm sorry. It's a curse. You're right. The girl behind the seat and that boy can pilot it. But neither captain Cahill nor I could. Is it that special? What's going on here? Is he serious?! What's with this bathroom music? It's what the designer liked, I bet! - Is that it? - Yes. Is your stomach better? Yeah, thanks... There's a ship hidden there. - 1 think that's a space ship. - Why? If they want to take back a woman who was taken prisoner in space, they have to go into space. It's floating in the water. Good grief. You three will get off here. Okay, raraiya, get on. Good girl. Let us down, please, lieutenant! My apologies, it seems to be damaged, and isn't working right. Liar. Captain! I'm sorry to have worried you! I was overly optimistic. I'm sorry. I relied on you too much, miss aida. My careless actions got captain Cahill killed. This must be difficult for you. So very difficult. Previously, we only used radar to detect space debris. But we will adjust to the tense political situation. That crown is carrying long-distance ground surveillance radars. We'll use them on the first nut. Hooray for the army! That's right! Our enemy now will be gondwan and ameria, who have been waging an intercontinental war for 10 years. Dellensen team, prepare to sortie! Right! - Go for it! - You're the first wave! - We've got high hopes, captain! - Instructor! Don't get hurt! - You're an expert! - The army'll be no big deal! - Luin! - Hey. Did you know the army was this large? With all the catsiths they've gathered here? Of course I knew. Is the whole capital guard becoming a military? I order captain dellensen's team to locate the space pirates, and carry out an operation to rescue the hostages. Men, get to it! Good work. I've done nothing compared to you. They sure have turned this into some carnival. - Colonel. - Is something the matter? Have you received his holiness's permission for all this? This is a rescue operation for your son and the civilians. I got clearance for it as a non-military action. What the capital army is doing, violates the ag-tech taboo against the advancement of science. His holiness is confused about the taboo. Instructor! Is it okay for you to eat so much? The oil they use here is great. We're careful about our ingredients. The pirate corps which attacked the crown launched from this ship? You're operations director wilmit zenam's son, huh? I have no value as a hostage. My mother's the type of person who can only think of her job. That's something a child would say. Captain, there's no need to feel responsible for me. Yes, but... Despite my father's opposition, I wanted to work aboard the megafauna. I appreciate it. Why did I come here? And who is this person? After what happened, it's clear the capital tower has changed. Even the recten this student used was technologically advanced. So the capital guard is violating the taboo as well, you mean? But the capital guard's technology... The capital tower's stance is delaying the world's recovery. As a result, ameria got into an intercontinental war with gondwan. The world has regressed to the time of the a.D. Calendar! Say what? I've been telling you all along! Bring all the g-type parts aboard the megafauna! I've heard of those. The Rose of hermes blueprints, right? If you use something like that, you really will be cursed! Now, listen here. Among the engineers, the blueprints that came to us from towasanga... Let's judge this boy under pirate law! Miss aida... You're the ones who started the war! Miss aida... Don't let those three out of here. Yes, sir. That's how she is. I know. She... She doesn't remember that. That's why she can condemn me. Are you awake? Cargo with a "g" Mark? There's the Caribbean ocean laboratory next to this ship, and in between is the weapons factory? You took aim at me! It's not loaded! What're you doing? You there, try moving the g-self! Huh? You killed captain Cahill, no? You people attacked the capital tower's crown... Just try it! The basic controls for all mobile suits are the same. Even I, an acclaimed genius, couldn't pilot it! - So you couldn't do it! - Have some. I'll run away. I'll keep these two as hostages. Do it! - You dirty...! - Come along. You have pretty eyes. I get that all the time. Come along! Lieutenant klim! Testing enemy abilities. Do you have the captain's permission? I trust you can arrange for that. Get going. Lieutenant klim! If what you've said is true, miss aida, - I'd like to test her as well. - For what? You mean raraiya? From what colonel cumpa rusita fold me, she was taken prisoner by the capital guard on a Monday, so she was named raraiya Monday. That day, captain Cahill and his men only brought back this machine. We'll load this on a fry-schop. Got it? Because captain Cahill and his men guided it to bequest island, I was able to meet the mobile suit I call g-self what is it? - They're doing maintenance on that. - The arcane? They've given it the full loadout. They've just attached everything to check out. Let me change that for you. I'm fine. You have a scratch as well. Lieutenant, something wrong? How can it be that a genius like me can't move this thing?! Is it that special? Doesn't it look like a g-type? Yeah, it does resemble the arcane. It's big inside, and the walls are all monitors. Rayhunton code accepted. What? Princess, it looks like the arcane, doesn't it? Yes. Shall I bring it down from the fry-schop for you? Don't be silly. I'll take over for you, Princess. He knew my weaknesses better than anyone. But he's gone now. How accurate is the radar? Well, it is a military radar. Break off, one by one! G. G. G. Please, calm down, raraiya. Here. I Chu. Chu. Chu. Chu. Chu. How did you enchant her? When you get out into space, it seems watery things have a healing effect. Really? Chuchumy. Chuchumy. If she gels excited when she sees the g-selr, I can only assume there must be some connection. You made it move, now let me see you fly! Lieutenant klim. I'll monitor him in the montero. Bellri is in ordinary clothes. He can't do anything too reckless. I think I can do minovsky flight. - Tll do it. - Don't close your hatch. I'm watching... It flew! Captain, to the bridge. Klim, you can head out first. Get out every grimoire you can! - You're in the way! - What's going on? Minovsky particles have been spread. Okay, if I switch to level flight, this'll be easy. Huh? Mr. klim? I can't hear you. Level one battle stations. Engines to critical, now. All hands... Hurry with the anti-air defenses! Coming in! Yes, miss aida, there's no doubt about it. They say if we don't release the hostages, they'll attack with mobile suits. The minovsky particles were dispersed after that transmission, correct? They called themselves the capital army. If releasing those three will end this, we should do it. No, even if we release the hostages, they've still found this place. - Take us out! - Launching! The grimoires at the rear will launch from there! Where's Adam Smith? The prisoner is piloting the g-self. Boy, take up arms' are gondwan attacking us? It's the capital army. They've found this place. I'll stop them! It's the capital army! Neither my mother nor I knew anything about the capital army! Your mother? We have raraiya and noredo here! That's why I have to go stop the army's attack! Adam Smith, bring the g-self a shield and rifle. Huh?! You want to arm a prisoner?! Grimoires, ascend with fry-schops! Noredo, hide in the safest part of the ship! Raraiya wants to go up top! Princess! Please, take shelter in the hangar! I'll do anti-air defense from here. If anything were to happen to you... I told happa to attach the wings! We were in the middle of installing the backpack! It's not a debt I can ever repay, but I'll do my darnedest to try! That kid... Sorry, my battles with gondwan have acclimated me to fighting in the air! Too slow! No! If they come at you with f-rugs, it'll be from above! I can't have you taking me lightly! Bilacky! That's that g-self, or whatever. Will you surrender? They came out of the clouds, like I thought! I found the mobile suit first! This is bellri zenam! Please, don't attack! Noredo and raraiya are on the ship! Does that pose mean he doesn't want to fight? You rank amateur! Letting yourself be led astray by the g-self's pose! Boy, you did well just to stall him! G-self! Will you surrender and come to the capital army? We can communicate through the contact link. Will you? That's you, right, instructor dellensen? It's me, bellri...! You want a fight? Hooah! What's going on? G-self! If you resist, I'll shoot you down here! From three directions at once?! Su-cord! What was that machine's beam? It's dozens of times more powerful than the beam saber. Th-th-they went away. You can hear me through the contact link, boy? Uh, yeah. Taking down three enemies in an instant was an impressive feat. Y-yeah, but... Why do you think they pulled back? Any commander who can decide to withdraw like that is a superb soldier. He cut off my montero's fingers as well. In which case, in order to protect miss aida, you'll have to master that machine, as well. He controlled it like it was his. He protected the megafauna. But a boy like that could never replace captain Cahill! No, you're coming inside. No, chuchumy's happy like this. - So happy! - Come on. Inside. Inside. You should be able to tell if you can swap the backpacks! Yes, but what about the electrical system? There's no mistaking it. Let's try. What? Huh? What could it be? - What? - Nothing. There are schematics here. Can we read them? It works independently as an escape pod. Try it out. Huh? Let's see how... I'll try it! Escape pod, coming out. Oh! This will be useful! Why is it working now? It must have gotten used to me. You've done a lot with it. Mr. happa, please handle maintenance on the moving parts, as well as replenishing the photon battery and propellant. Got it. Before that, let me copy the data off that monitor. Can you get it off? If you leave it with us in this state, we'll figure something out. Noredo, hurry up and change or you'll get sick! Raraiya won't budge from this spot! In the capital army's attack today, I learned that they have a superb soldier on their side. Neither the capital guard nor even my mother knew about the capital army. Your mother? They learned that something which threatens your mother will be coming from space. That's why the capital army was formed. Something's coming from space? Lieutenant, is that true? I heard it yesterday from inspector general surugan in the homeland. My father? You're aida surugan? Captain, lieutenant. - I'll deal with it. - Leave it to us. We can use the g-type backpacks manufactured here. Bell! Let's go back to the capital tower! Go back! Go back! Both this and raraiya came from the sky. Aren't you curious about the lieutenant's story? Yeah! The people on this ship owe you one now, so we can go back! Huh? Oh! You're right. Just because his holiness says that they're abiding by the taboo... My crowns have been repainted in army colors! The capital army is obviously violating the taboo! Protect the world, capital army! New machines! That's an elf bullock. Were we ordered to withdraw because these were officially adopted? This is the first mass-produced machine based on your elf bull data. A nice piece of work, huh? - Look at that mask! - He's so cool! Lame. His physique... What's with that? Thank you for seeing me off before I sortie. We have high hopes. What's that mask for? It works as a monitor. It helps with some operations too. It's a prototype based on files from the research division. This mood is so different from the capital guard. Colonel, you have the Rose of hermes blueprints from the previous era... If you're asking me to violate the taboo, I'll require many times the staff and budget I have now. Which is why I must insist you stop poaching people from the capital guard. But the army is working so hard to rescue your son. The capital army is also keeping ameria and gondwan in check while dealing with the threat from space. They're noble people who deliver photon batteries. Why are they a threat? Why can't you understand? Miss aida, could you tell me something? What's this threat from outer space that lieutenant klim mentioned? Haven't you asked him? He said he'd tell me if I joined the pirate corps. Then join. I can't do that! Supply ships come here, and they have new mobile suit models... - Look, a friend. - Yo! Lieutenant klim Nick. They're a military unit, all right. You believe the son of the capital towers operations director when he says he knows nothing of towasanga? Capital guard students think of little but the crown schedules. Lieutenant. Towasanga is the holy land of the su-cordists, who bring us photon batteries, right? You believe that? What would you think if I said the g-self was made in towasanga? Towasanga? Towa...? Towa! Towa! Towa! Towa! Towa! Towasanga! Chuchumy. You sure do like that fish, raraiya. Chuchumy. Are you sure the g-self was built there? Captain donyell has suggested this girl may be able to tell us. Hey. Lieutenant, I need you to sign for these. Fine work, Mick Jack. You brought yet another new model today. The hecate. It handles better than you might think by looking at it. Well, I'm off to my next stop! When I say you can't, you can't. This ship will now cease unloading supplies from the asmuch. Why so suddenly? Huh? The main force has moved up its schedule? If you think about it... The fact that this was made in towasanga... What? That thing is still out? We have a lot of other things to do! Oh, my. Lieutenant happa has fallen in love with it all over again. What's this alarm for? The space fleet will be going into sub-orbital flight sooner. So we have to move faster. What are these air balls for? They're old, so I was testing them. You can't come. Neither can you! Chuchumy. We're tracing captain dellensen's course. Are there places you could hide a ship around here? Quite a few. Captain, what's going on? When is the megafauna starting the decoy operation? The schedule's been moved up. Chuchumy. Those kids trail behind us like baby ducks. Just pretend they aren't there. This ship is presently moving in response to unknown machines. How many unknowns are there? About two squadrons, it looks like. They aren't from the gondwan army, correct? This is the course from the capital territory. Does the capital army have this much fighting strength? That's something we should be asking you! Stop! To make captain Cahill's wishes come true, let's crush those that approach and commence the decoy operation. Meanwhile, the main space fleet will occupy the capital tower. You're going to occupy the capital tower?! Must you ruin all of captain Cahill's plans?! I'm sure I can never apologize enough for that, but I apologize. Just apologizing isn't enough! I know it isn't a fair trade, but I'll defend this ship in return. Lend me a pilot suit. Well? Let's hear our genius lieutenant's opinion. Let's be patient with him. We need fighting strength. Captain! He's a useful boy, Princess. Lieutenant, you handle this. Yes, ma'am! Boy! Having to acknowledge that boy... Yes. I'm going to go get changed. The f-rugs are capital army doubey types, with catsiths on them. I can't call this one. Guess we'll see what lieutenant klim is capable of. Open hatches as soon as we've taken off. Any transmissions from Mick Jack? She's cut off communication. Do the rest yourself. 0-okay. Wow! It's a perfect fit! Adjusting the seat and this attachment was a pain. Use that helmet. Thank you. Hey, when are we escaping in the g-self? There's going to be a battle, so we can't right now. I promised the people on this ship. You're still crushing on that woman. - Chuchumy too! - Chuchumy can't wear one! Raraiya came from towasanga. How do you know that? She's not surprised to see these outfits at all. This is it. Curse that pirate ship. Are they planning to launch into space? Spread all fins, and so minovsky flight! Hold it in place! - What are you doing? - Can't you tell? This is molded rubber for use in space, right? There are water balls in here! Locked in! - Um, they told me to sortie. - I know! Check these on the control panel. Lower the crane! The hatch is opening! Grimoires to the front! Miss aida will defend from the ship's deck. The arcane can fly too, you know! I'd rather you refrain from such jokes. It hasn't been tested yet. Catsiths, don't lag behind. There's heavy wind! Be careful! The rear hatch is opening as well! - Have you figured it out? - Yeah! The air and water circuits can be used as propellant. Huh? Mr. happa? I'm checking the docking sensor. The montero is heading out! All right, go! Princess, you won't hit them with the anti-ship rifle. If I adjust the targeting, I can manage. I've matched up the sensors here. Three of them! Take this! Machine guns, aim straight up! The main force will come from below! I'll keep them in check! Just like the lieutenant said! They came from sea level! Our catsith formation isn't just for show! They got one of us! What?! A direct hit on my rifle?! Now die! I have more javelins! - Core! - Raraiya! Bell, what are you doing?! Bellri zenam! Stick that thing in the back of the g-self! You can say that... But this thing won't listen! Okay. What? I can't land a hit! Get the Princess to the g-self. Sure! Princess! Grab young bellri and stuff him into the g-self! Huh? I can't do that! Don't get picky with me during battle! The core fighter is moving around on its own! It flew off! That's the genius lieutenant's montero! Now I finish you from behind! I can't take steady aim! Wh-what? You fool! What good is the inside? Did the machine guns come out? The reinforcement schops are doing well. Gisela! Don't hold back on the anti-air fire! Roger that. Hey, you shouldn't do that! We won't need bullets for the decoy operation! This isn't good! My head! The water balls! What kind of attack is this? Did I fall into the sea? I-it's water! Bellri zenam, come back here and dock! Boy, the megafauna has the g-self out! Turn back! Even if they have it out, you expect me to dodge anti-air fire? He can't do it like this! What? That kid plans to go through with it?! Don't move. You see the g-self's back? Th-the light sensor reacted, but... You can do it. I-I'm gonna crash! I'm in! Electric system, fixed! Bellri, please. Okay, I think I can do this! Get up there and repel them! What am I supposed to do without a backpack? Hit and run! You can fly for 45 seconds! Then move aside! I can't see a thing! S-sorry. The genius pilot lost his head. He flew! 45 seconds! You dare resist me?! He's turned his beam sabers into a net to block it! I can't win by just defending! What?! The capital army mustn't use such things! Those beams... did they stretch? Colonel cumpa rusita said nothing about such an ability! But I have the data from this battle! I-'m a goner. Use the nozzles in the waist and knees to slow our descent! L-like this? Reinforcements are coming. Hang in there. The megafauna has another operation after this. Another operation? The arcane is flying too? The g-self is inside, so hurry up and shut the main gate! Air density, 0.005. Air density is thin! That's enough! Chuchumy says welcome home. It looks like you're getting better, raraiya. - Chuchumy. - She is. It seems this view puts her at ease. She must be used to this sort of thing. He did worse than I expected. He did come back with no head, maybe he really is a genius. We have the parts, don't we?! We can't just plug them in! It's your job to make it work regardless! - Lieutenant happa. - Oh, captain. Make sure maintenance is done by the next decoy operation. Yes, I know. Thanks. We're going into space... It may be sub-orbital flight, but it's like a space trip. What are you trying to say? I intend to thank him myself as well, but please, Princess, commend bellri zenam. Because we need him for the next operation? No. It's your job as a Princess to thank him for saving the megafauna, and your obligation. My obligation? Because you're the one who will become a Princess. The megafauna moves to draw the capital army's attention, and it makes my father's space fleet do practical training. For that, you tell me to forget personal grudges, and fulfill my obligations. It's what you must do, as the daughter of inspector general gusion, the leader of the amerian army. That's... - We have enough parts? - It's not about the number. A space backpack for the g-self? This is the reality? Delicious! It's water candy. One piece lasts you half a day. You keep it in your space suit. We can do that. Right? As a capital guard cadet, there's something I still need to do. This ship's data... Bellri zenam, I'd like to thank you once again. Wh-what? Why so suddenly? Thanks to your hard work, the megafauna can go to space. Your courage is my pride. We don't want to die either, so let's call it even. Even? I guess so. Hey, kid. I could recommend you for the amerian army as second lieutenant. First lieutenant or it's not happening. After I become a captain, then. Princess. Chuchumy. All hands! This ship will now enter sub-orbital spaceflight. All sections check for air leaks. We may need fo launch mobile suits again. Hurry with the docking adjustments on the fry-schops fixed outside. Cahill, forgive me. Cahill, I'm sorry. I had no choice... But to thank a pilot who was your enemy. Why can that boy do that, but I... Am I to blame? We still have things to tie down! That hurts! Fry-schop landing confirmed. Switch from minovsky flight to sub-orbital spaceflight. All hands, prepare space suits. Steer, got it? Roger, madam! Captain dellensen, where are you? By the elf bull's hatch. It may be my capital tower under nut, but I don't recall lending it fo a military base. We're just borrowing it for a bit. Your son bellri zenam and his friends... It's to get them back from the space pirales. Captain dellensen? Launching from the under nut? We'll make a pincer attack with the forces launching from earth, and rescue bellri so please overlook this. Okay? Translation and subtitling: Bti studios limited - Hold on! - Again! Launch! Damn your reconguista! Why!? About the threat from space... We're withdrawing! I won't let the g-self charge ahead! Ll o. Lo on I: I I: = la. Ll: Oe: I oo a on...
