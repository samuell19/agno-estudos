Cassidy everything is settled well maybe would maybe I can explain what I mean just before we left Denton oh boy and I'll just have to replay that's the most amazing thing I ever heard it's fantastic utterly fantastic but it's true every word of it well I hope you have something tangible some proof to bear out your story I expect the partnership agreement on today's stage you intend to make use of it I certainly will of it'll keep that fake brother from getting the ranch then knock foster must be informed immediately for the time being I rather would kept this just between ourselves but I've already returned the papers to him he must be told or he'll go ahead and turn over the estate to the same posture I don't worry about that I'll see that he doesn't yeah but why are we why not expose this boy immediately now I'm convinced that the boy is small-fry any move with this tie might disturb the big fish oh I see well I said I do appreciate your coming over mr. Cassidy I'll bet ten down and turn better did you make it I mean our a huge money see that unraised you falling I'll see you at 40 and raise you a tea all right I'll see that AZ now wait a minute you can't Bluff a man with a pat hand you didn't take your dirty paws off of me yes siree I'm sure for an army that can take care of himself I'm just gonna run them out of town stick I can recommend say it they won oh that I'm just to help us hold full fit for the boneyard right yeah you said so yourself sug so I did turn it down much for getting stuff from the haters well as in the car just running myself down that way don't take it so hard let's go see a partnership boys watch this strangers from the looks I'm I'm pretty sure I rendered little fellow Senora was telling us about you mean m3 from Denton well there were only two of them but they fit your description to a tee I believe I can account for the third one the young fella each of the ranch the three of them showed up out there looking for work work they didn't come here looking for work I thought you said there be no kickback well there's nothing that can't be cleaned up now we'll get up and do it I'm gonna watch out for that big fellows right it comes at you like the hind end of a mule he won't get a chance to use it foster I don't like the looks of this thanks for getting too hot to suit me you getting ready to tuck your tail between your legs and play Jack Rabbit no now don't worry I'll finish with you and have you on your way in no time now this is what I want you to do tonight at the party I wonder if the other two will show up you're written to meet up with that mower we know we're still hurt yeah not in there holiday thank you very much mr. Cassidy I'm so glad to see you all the time to make that announcement friends friends I I have something rather unpleasant to tell you I think you ought to know that my sister and I are disposing of the diamond hitch I hope you know what that will mean to these ranchers you mean about the water rights your dad always took care of us with that son without his help we couldn't have existed yes I know I'll do everything I can to try to persuade the new owners to continue the arrangement who are you selling to bud a large Eastern syndicate they don't want me to mention any names until the deal is closed well I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me I have to leave immediately in order to meet the Syndicates representative at the county seat in the morning good night just a minute what do you want I'm afraid you'll have to hold up the sale of the ranch what are you talking about would you explain what this is all about I think this'll explain it why this is a four-way partnership covering two-thirds of the diamond hits ranch yes and it's signed by Bud Lawton I never signed any such paper I didn't say you did I said it was signed by Bud Lawton mr. Cassidy what what do you mean mr. Lawton I held back telling you this as long as I could but bud was shot down in Denton this man isn't your brother you would seem to be drunker crazy take it through water keep your head you fool say nothing I'll handle it easy here's some water for you take I'm sorry I had to be so blunt about telling you it I understand mr. Cassidy I understand now supposing we get back to your story why was Bud Lawton killed and by home well I'm sorry I don't know maybe I can supply the answer to both those questions this partnership what do you mean people don't go around giving ranches away of course you're right Sheriff this man his friends are imposters they're trying to rob Sam lawless children I told you the truth and you can verify it by getting in touch with the authorities and Denton well I'll have to lock you three up until I've had time to investigate your story but you can't do that Sheriff I believe you're that do come on boys spread out was California I gotta get this man to a doctor Bradley could take care of him in dere horses let us take care of them Sheriff it'll save you the expense of a trial yeah we know how to handle these hombres that try to rob Sam lost children in the long take care of him get on your horse Cassidy coffee and doughnuts doughnuts and coffee Oh God for two things I wouldn't need them okay we have a little meet once in a while are we gonna get out of this place your guess is as good as mine you would insist on come along listen either been at the barn 20 instead of in your guest of honor of the necktie party we've always stuck together well it's hanging together much less pleasant thought did I say hej hello plan how are the wolves down at the saloon doing hourly plenty ripping the boys have got him worked up to the point where they yelling for ropes them trees as good as stretched as well we'll use the temper of the townspeople as an excuse but we're going to handle this a little bit differently mr.
