Oh. This is the conveyor belt? Wait, wait, wait. Balraj, get the other one. Lalita! And check this one. I'll just check that one. This is mayhem. This is, like, bedlam. It's good, isn't it? What do you mean, it's a little bit like New York? Better get used to it, Darcy. We're here for two weeks. Jesus, Balraj, where the hell have you brought me? Hurry up, you silly girls. We must make sure Jaya meets this Mr. Balraj from London, before anyone else. All mothers think that any single guy with big bucks must be shopping for a wife. I'm embarrassed to say it, but I hope he is. What, shopping or loaded? Well... both. Lakhi, you think your mother has gone crazy that I'm letting you wear that? I told you, Lakhi. It's very vulgar. But Mama, it's killing, Mama. Ooh, it's killing. It's what everyone's wearing in Mumbai. But we want Balraj to look into Jaya's eyes, not your mammies! She's our only hope. If we do not get the elders married first, we'll never be able to marry rest of you for the shame! Come on, Lakhi. It's only a party. Save your fussing for the big wedding tomorrow. Papa, just chill. I have to fix my dupatta. Oh-ho. Hi, Lakhi! Hi. - Lakhi. - Hello. Can we sit here? Please do. Mama, we go and see the bride, OK? Chandra, don't be too long. Oh, this must be the famous Balraj from UK. He's from the Uppal family of Delhi, you know. Hey, Balraj. You've waded a long piece from London. Is that his name? I completely forgot groom is bringing guest from England. Apparently, he's a barrister. Is that right? A barrister? And his family live in Windsor, near the queen's castle. Really? Next to the queen? Oh, his sister is looking so lovely, so fair, no? Who is that Englishman with him? He's American. His name is William Darcy. He was Balraj's fast friend at Oxford. From one of the richest families in America. They own hotels all over the world. Shame he's not Indian, though. You sure you're OK about going away to London? You only met him twice. He's nice and so is his family. You need to get out of this town, Lalita. You know there's nothing for you here. All the guys just want girls from rich families. Papa needs me. I couldn't leave. His friend Balraj is great. He's looking for a girl too, you know. Good Lord, is it me, or is every woman over 50 giving you the eye? Don't be dense, Darcy. Every mother in this room is wetting her knickers for him for their daughters. Can we leave yet? Kiran, I'm his best man. I can't just bail out on him, can I? It's 10 a.m. in New York. I wouldn't mind getting back just a little early so I can go through the financials in a hotel and go... Will you stop working just this once? And you stop being such a coconut. This is our dear, dear Motherland. Enjoy it. The only thing India's good for is losing weight. Are you sure this is safe to eat? I don't wanna be getting Delhi Belly on my first day. What's happening now? The Indian version of American Idol. - I hope you brought your earplugs. - This is great. This is where the girl sees the boys and the boy sees the girls. Brace yourself, Darcy. He's about to transform into the Indian MC Hammer. What are they like? What are they saying? "Oh, these pretty girls fluttering temptingly, like kites without string." "These girls are like naked live wires. If you get too close, you'll get an electric shock of love." Ugh. Oh, my gosh. There's still time. Ha-ha-ha. That-That was fantastic. Very good. Come on. Come on. Come on. The two of you dance. Thank you. Darcy, what are you doing? The drawstring keeps coming undone. I don't know why you made me wear these pants. Why don't we just alert the media? She's too outrageous. I'm telling you, she'll give us all a bad name. You know she is spending all night texting boys? Lakhi, stop right now. Lakhi. Good evening, sir. We're from the groom's side. We'd like to introduce ourselves, if we may. - I'm Balraj, this is my sister Kiran... - Hi. - and my very good friend, William Darcy. - Hello. Very nice to meet you all. - Sir. - I am Shamin Bakshi. May I introduce my family to you? This is my wife, Mrs. Manorama Bakshi, and these are my daughters, Jaya, Lalita. That's Lakhi and that's Maya. Good Lord, four daughters in one family. God has blessed you four times over. Such a pleasure to make your fine acquaintance. Ahem. Would you do me the honor? - Papa? - Of course, of course. Please, please. Darcy, why don't you ask one of Jaya's lovely sisters to dance as well? No. I'm sorry, I can't. I must get back and work. I have a conference call. But it's easier than you think. I can show you... No, I... really can't. Maybe another time. Rich American. What does he think? We are not good enough for him? You should have seen Mrs. Lamba's face. Balraj didn't dance with any other girl all night. I knew he wouldn't be able to resist my pretty Jaya's charms. Or yours, I'm sure. Just imagine if Jaya went to live in UK. We could visit her anytime. I would hate to have my daughters be so far away. But we have so many. One or two can go abroad. They'll earn more. God knows, they'll need to, 'cause we can't afford to give them all decent dowries. Perhaps we should have drowned one or two at the time of their birth. We wouldn't have had these problems if we had gone to U.S. when we had the chance. Did I tell you about this Indian fellow who went to America and made it rich? My brother did all the paperwork to sponsor us, but no, you didn't want to leave. This fellow went to America and bought this huge American house and built three swimming pools in the garden. Now he owns three Subway franchises in New Jersey, and what do we have? Ha-ha. An old house, an old farm - and new bills. - So when his father visited from India, he showed him around his mansion and three swimming pools. His father asked, "But, son, why do you need three pools?" So he said proudly, "Well, one is filled with cold water for when I feel hot. The second is filled with hot water when I feel cold." The father nodded and said, "Why is the third pool empty?" He said, "Well, that's when I don't feel like swimming at all." Listen, Balraj, if you really wanna get married, why don't you just hook up with some Indian girl from England, or even America? At least you'd have something in common. I didn't have any problems talking with Jaya, did I? She's intelligent, she's beautiful. Come on, Bal, look around you. You said it yourself, man. We're in Hicksville, India. Then why did I see you eyeing up Lalita? She's beautiful, yeah, but... But... not your mom's idea of the mother of her heirs, right? Not exactly, no. Bye. Give me that bag. - Why? - Forget it. I wanna go over there. - Come, I wanna go to that one. - Just give me the bag. ♪ Is this going to be ♪ The last time we three ♪ Walk down this street together? ♪ She's going to be wed ♪ It doesn't mean she's dead ♪ We'll be friends forever ♪ It's not long before the day ♪ I up, up, up and fly away ♪ So let's make this a walk to remember ♪ There are stars in your way ♪ From Amritsar to UK ♪ There are stars in your way ♪ From Amritsar to UK ♪ You are the golden girl, the center of the world ♪ Just ask, and you shall have it ♪ This is your moment, grab it ♪ Your wish is our command ♪ We'll supply what you demand ♪ You've turned their lives around ♪ You got a marriage into town ♪ Marriage has come to town ♪ Laughter, color, light and sound ♪ Life is great, let's celebrate ♪ The sacred union two souls have found ♪ Oh ♪ Oh ♪ You see, flowers are most important ♪ Bright colors can never be forgotten ♪ No one can be at your wedding ♪ With a bad taste in their mouth ♪ So we will supply the rasamali ♪ The guests won't leave without ♪ Look at that.

Mmm, I know enough to know that if that damn cute Darcy was looking at me the way he's looking at you now, I wouldn't ignore him. You're nuts, Chandra. God, is he coming up? - Lalita... - Huh? Marry him, divorce him right away, then give me half. Someone's having some fun up here. Hope it's not my tie, is it? - No. We're just jok... - Excuse me. Someone's thinking of you. I'm off to get a Coke. Bye. - What'd she say? - It's just an old saying. We say whenever you sneeze, it means someone's thinking of you. It was probably my lawyer. Can't get any work done in the hotel I'm in. - Which hotel's that? - It's the Diyan International. That's the best hotel in town. Oh. But their computer system keeps crashing, the electricity goes. I don't know how business functions here. Are you a barrister like Balraj? No, no, no. My family's in the hotel business. I'm sure Amritsar's hotels can't compare, but I bet there's a slight price difference. How much does it cost to stay in one of your hotels? A good room, about $400-$500 a night. Ha! That's more than what most people make here in a year. Well, that's pretty bad when you put it like that, but people who can afford it, they want the best. There's nothing wrong with having standards, is there? No, as long as you don't impose them on others. This is your first Indian wedding, right? Mm, yeah. It's been an experience. - You're not enjoying it? - No, no, I am. I just find the whole arranged-marriage thing a little strange. I don't really know if two people can get married that don't really know each other. It's a little backward, don't you think? That's such a cliché. It's different now. It's more like a global dating service. The groom looks pretty happy. Did his parents force him into it? No, he asked his parents to find him a bride, actually. He was busy running his company. He just wanted it to be simple. I see, and so he came here. Is that what you think, too? That India is the place to go for simple women? - That's not what I meant. - It's funny. Americans think they've got the answers for everything, including marriage. Pretty arrogant considering they've got the highest divorce rate in the world. What I was trying to say is that he wanted a bride who was traditional and... Darcy! Stop boring her to death and come and get down with us. Listen, uh, I'm a hopeless dancer, but... this looks like you screw in a light bulb with one hand, you pet the dog with the other. Will you teach me? You know what? I think you should find someone simple and traditional to teach you to dance like the natives. We're all flying down to Goa tomorrow. Darcy's looking into a hotel he may acquire. Mr. Bakshi, we'd love for Jaya to join us as our guest. How nice. A hotel in Goa. Mr. Balraj, I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to let Jaya go on her own. - Oh, I understand. - Don't be silly, dear. It's so kind of you to invite Jaya. Perhaps her sister can accompany her. - I think I can go to Goa. - Lakhi, you're too young. I think Lalita should accompany her sister. - But, Papa... - Don't be a silly girl. Go and have fun with your sister. Sure, I'd love to come with Jaya. Wonderful. I'll send the driver over in the morning. - Good night to you all. - Good night. - And good night, yes. - Bye-bye. - Good night. - Good night. Have you gone crazy, old man? This is Jaya's chance to win him once and for all. And he'll get to see her in a swimsuit. Are you crazy? Hello. What's this? Oh. Thank you. Ma'am, your Sea Breeze. - Oh, thanks. - Ma'am. Darcy, darling, will you tear yourself away from the love of your life and put some lotion on my back? I don't wanna get too dark. I'm writing to my little sister Georgie. Oh, my God. You lugged that all this way? That explains why you haven't got much room for outfits. Do you have something against books, or do you resent them because they leave less room in your bag for your makeup? No. No, I just never have time for them. Indians here have a lot more free time. Or maybe you're a much more accomplished woman than I am. Mm-hmm, maybe. Darcy's a great reader. In fact, I think a love of books is on his list for his ideal woman. I think you've had one too many Sea Breezes. I clearly remember a very drunken night in Oxford when you recited the list. Let me see, she has to be smart, speak several languages... - Kiran, drop it. - No. I recall she had to be athletic... voluptuous, of course, graceful, witty, confident. I'm not surprised Mr. Darcy hasn't found his ideal woman with a list like that. Does this mean you're an ideal man? Well, I guess you'd be a better judge of that than me. As far as I can tell, most men have faults. Arrogance, pride, vanity. She certainly read you like a book, Darcy. No. I just think you got me all wrong. Well, you'd certainly have trouble finding your ideal woman in India. I didn't hear simple, traditional, subservient on your list. Come on, gimme a break. Now you're twisting my words. You said yourself that you're used to the best. I'm sure you think India's beneath you. If I really thought that, then why would I be thinking about buying this place? Ha-ha. You think this is India? Don't you wanna see more investment, more jobs? Yes, but who does it really benefit? You want people to come to India without having to deal with Indians. Oh, that's good. Remind me to add that to the tourism brochure. Isn't that what all tourists want here, five-star comfort with a bit of culture thrown in? Well, I don't want you turning India into a theme park. I thought we got rid of Imperialists like you. I'm not British. I'm an American. Exactly. 40 acres on this side, sir. What the hell's he doing here? Oh, my God.

Hello again. Hey. How are you? Fine, thanks. - Can I join you? - Sure. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. - I'm not much of a drinker. - Well, then neither am I. I've been drinking out here 'cause it's cheaper than the water. I'm Johnny, by the way. I'm Johnny Wickham. Pleased to meet you, Johnny. I'm Lalita. Lalita. How do you know Will Darcy? I saw you two blank each other. I was gonna go over and say hi to the guy, but then I realized I'd have to talk to the wanker. We sort of grew up together 'cause... my mum used to work for Darcy's family in England. She was his nanny. See, their family had a couple of big, old country hotels... Mm-hmm. Dad was a really keen... well, Darcy's dad was a really keen golfer, and I used to caddy for him. Really nice old fella. Gave me a great job when I left school, and... I don't know, Darcy was never too keen. So when the old man died a few years back, you can guess who was the first one to get fired. Just like that? With his dad gone, he didn't have to explain, did he? - But your mum helped raise him. - Yes, she did. You know, Darcy's mum is even worse than he is. She's been trying to get him hitched to this... I don't know, this rich New York girl for years. It's the ultimate business merger. So she's arranging his marriage? You could call it that, yeah. What a hypocrite. See, that's the great thing about living in India. You don't have to have money to enjoy this place, and if you have money, you never get to see the real India, you know. I just feel like people here have got their priorities sorted. I'd love for you to come to Amritsar. It's... It's beautiful. It's just that not many tourists go there. Am-Amritsar. Is that where the Golden Temple is? Yeah. I'm sorry we're leaving today, but I'd love to show you my hometown. Yeah, I'd love to show you London. ♪ My eyes are searching, my hips are working ♪ My lips are waiting, take me to love ♪ My skin's pulsating, my body's shaking ♪ My lips are waking, take me to love ♪ India's the place for me ♪ India sets you free ♪ My eyes are searching, my hips are working ♪ My lips are waiting, take me to love ♪ Oh ♪ Take me ♪ Take me to love ♪ To love ♪ Oh, no Hurry up, Bejali.

Maya, hurry up with the bucket! He'll be here soon! - Who? Who, Mama? - Don't ask. Kholi sahib. - He's on his way from the airport. - Who? Kholi. He's your father's sister's husband's sister's son, and he's a top accountant in California. But why is he coming here? To look at me for his bride. What do you think?! Hurry up, girls. Come on here. I want to look at you. Hurry up, hurry up. Come on fast. Now listen to me carefully, girls, huh? It's very important to make a good first impression on Kholi sahib. Stand straight, smile, don't talk unnecessarily, and don't say anything too intelligent. You. Shame she only selectively practices what she preaches. Why don't you go outside and welcome the guest? I'll do that. Bejali, go outside and get the luggage. Mama G, what's up? Hello. How are you? Ho-ho-ho. Bejali is here. Go outside, you bloody fool. Hey! Ew... Bejali. Oh!Hey! Come in, Kholi sahib. Welcome. We weren't expecting you so early. You've really taken us by surprise. What a pleasure to see you, Mama G, after so long time. Oh... oh, who? Oh, of course. You remember my daughters. Jaya, Lalita... Uh...Maya... and Lakhi. From small, great caterpillars to such beautiful butterflies. And so like you, Madam Butterfly. This is my dream home. Colonial-style, five bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms. $850,000. - That's 4 crores, 25 lakhs. - Oh, my. I bought it only six months ago. It's already worth $900,000. Bet it has three swimming pools. Uh, actually, the complex has two pools. Plus, my crib... has its own hot tub bath with super jets. It's the bomb. Is it near Beverly Hills, 90210? No. No... No, it's in the valley. But 20 minutes down 101 Freeway, and you're in North Hollywood. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Did you hear that, Lalita? He lives in Hollywood. You must join me in U.S. You must, you must, you must. I could help you start a business there. That's where the money's to be made. UK's finished. India's too corrupt. Kholi sahib, India's still a young country since independence. I hardly think its potential is over. And what do you think your U.S. was like after 60 years of independence? They were all killing each other over slavery and blindly searching for gold. Tell you what. I've made a packet as an accountant in LA. The Indian community there is very professional, all doctors and computers and... Not like these uneducated, minicab, 7-Eleven-store types. It's ours for the taking. Anyone can become an Amrikan. Then why come back here? - Ah... bada-bing, bada-boom. - Bada-bing, bada-boom... There's only one problem with Amrika. our girls that are born there... they've totally lost their roots, completely clueless. Our girls are very rooted. They're really very, very traditional. You know, in U.S., they're all too outspoken and career-orientated, and some... have even turned into... the lesbian. Ahem. So that leaves me no choice... I may be healthy, wealthy and wise, but as they say, "No life... without wife." Kholi sahib. You're a poet as well. Did you hear that, Mr. Bakshi, huh? "No life without wife." Yes. Very wisely spoken. I think God is smiling down on me. I'm spoiled for choice in this house. I suppose, as the eldest... Jaya must be the first choice. A-Actually, Kholi sahib, Jaya's practically engaged to someone else. But Lalita is unspoken for. Lalita.

Thank you. - Yes? - Namasteto you. I came to see Lalita. I'm friends with her. Friends? Yes. Lalita! Yes, Mama. - Hi. - Hi. - You made it. - Yeah, I made it. - Come in. - Thank you. - How was your journey? - It was great. Thank you very much. - Hello, Johnny. - Hi, Jaya. How are you? Papa, this is our friend from Goa. - Johnny Wickham. He's from London. - Sha Bakshi. Oh, pleased to meet you. Johnny Wickham. He wanted to see the Golden Temple, so do you think he could stay with us, Papa, please? Yes, of course. We can do with some fresh conversation here. - I'll show you the guest room. Come on. - Thank you, Mr. Bakshi. Miss Bakshi. Oh, God, he's too yum. Shh, he can hear you. He cannot stay here. Hippies are dirty and they steal. Mama, he's not a hippie. And what will Kholi sahib say? He is staying here in a house full of young unmarried women? Your Mr. Kholi's been in the house a day, and he's already running things? I think we can take him to the Garba tonight, huh, Mama? Lalita, please may I have the first dance with him? See what you've started? Don't be ridiculous, Lakhi. He cannot come to the Garba. But Mama, there's never enough cute boys to dance with. Have you all gone mad? What will Balraj think of us if we all end up there with him? Surely unfair. - What's unfair? - Papa... she will not have our friend come to the Garba. Of course he should come and see Garba with us. I just invited him. This is really a madhouse. I'm so glad he's come. I really didn't think he'd make it. I can't wait to see Balraj. I wish he didn't have to bring that Darcy with him. There's one thing I don't quite understand, though. If Darcy is Balraj's best friend, he can't be as awful as Johnny thinks he is. Jaya, you look absolutely beautiful. Ha-ha-ha-ha. And, Lalita, you look nice, too. You really made an effort tonight. No doubt, you had certain someone in mind. Hey, mastered the Garba already? Uh, no. I could only hope and pray, really. Lakhi's a great teacher, though. Oh, his Garba style is killing, man. Come on, Jaya, they're here. Move away, please. - Oh. - Sorry. Lakhi. Lakhi. I'm so sorry about my mother. She can be a little abrupt. It's all right. There's no need to apologize. I appreciate her letting me stay. I'm so glad you came. You couldn't come to India and not see Amritsar. No, you were right. It's very beautiful. You sure you're ready for this? I'm willing to take the risk. - Hello. Oh, hi. - Hi. Hey there, buddy. Buddy, how are you? Madam, would you do me the honor? You know, actually, I prefer American hip-hop, but as Gloria Estefan says, "The rhythm is going to get you." So bring it on. Huh? - Hi. - Hi. You look liked you were working hard out there. Hey there, partner. This is Mr. Kholi, and this is my best friend Chandra Lamba. Oh, oh... It is such a great pleasure to meet yet another beautiful young lady. There must be something magical in the water in Amritsar. I'll happily get drunk on it. Please, can I have the honor of getting you ladies a soft drink, huh? Yes, please. Thank you. Oh, my God. I thought he was gonna put you in hospital out there. Try eating with him. It's like looking at a Jackson Pollock painting. So... Jaya told me you met someone in Goa. Maybe. So Mr. Darcy didn't manage to seduce the jewel of Amritsar? Please. He's such a conceited, arrogant... Hello, Lalita. - Hello. - Hi. I've been studying this Garba thing. Looks a little out of my league, but what the hell? Would you like to dance? Sure. Lalita... She... So I believe we're coming to your house for dinner tomorrow night. Balraj said your father invited us all. Can't wait. Surprised to see your old friend Johnny? I wasn't so much surprised as disappointed. He's staying with us. My family really like him. Oh, yeah, everyone loves Wickham. Makes friends easily, and he loses them just as quickly. And what about you? Are you a loyal friend? What are you talking about? I've heard so many things about you, Darcy. I really can't seem to figure you out. Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to everything you hear. You should talk. After all the rubbish you said about arranged marriages, I can't believe your mother's arranging yours. May I have this dance, Madam Bakshi? I thought you'd never ask. Shall we, uh... Lalita! Bejali! Where is my china?! I'm sorry about this stupid dinner tonight. I wanted you to join us. Don't worry about it. I'm used to it. Still, I wish you could come. It would make this evening a lot less boring. Ah, there you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. Where have you been? Lakhi's decided she wants to show me the town tonight. Uh-huh. I want to take him for Amritsar fish, fruit cream and hot gulab jamuns. That's nice. - Where are you looking? Look at me. - Bejali, bring my china, please! Cholo, Bejali. I'm warning you. The cobra dance. Oh! Thank you. That was lovely, Maya. - Papa, shall I play the sitar now? - That's all right, Maya. You have entertained us enough for the evening, OK? Thank you. Very good. I still can't believe I'm sitting with a Darcy in Amritsar, of all places. - This world is too small, no, dude? - Way too small. Lalita, my firm has been doing business for many years with Darcy's mother, Miss Catherine. Beautiful lady. - She has such a big hotel in Beverly Hills. - Can I get anyone else a drink? - Me, please. - Yes, please. Let me help you with that. Why don't you all have something? Balraj, have something. I saw you dance with Wickham the other night, and I hear from Darcy that he's staying with you. - Yeah. So? - Look, don't fall for his bullshit. He's more trouble than he looks. You know his mother was Darcy's nanny... And you're Darcy's friend. Of course you'd take his side, wouldn't you? There's no crime in being the son of a servant. I've heard so many stories about your Mr. Darcy sahib in Goa, Balraj. Let's just say that Darcy and India have had a little bit of a rough time. Ah, these Indians, they don't know how to treat tourists. - There's no sophistication. - What do you mean "these Indians"? - Are you no longer an Indian? - I'm a green card-holder now. India's decades behind. Well, I think there's a lot about India that we don't have. Really? Like what? Uh, well... Well, I think it's nice the way the families come together. I lost my father a while back, and my mom spends a lot of her time in New York, so my sister and I, we don't really have a family home. I can't remember the last time that all my family kind of got together like this. Kholi sahib is only trying to win over my daughters. Yes. He wants them to be in love with America as much as he is. And why is that? Well, you can see for yourself, Mr. Darcy. They are all exceptional marriageable prospects for any single young man. Well, I hope you brought big appetites. Mrs. Bakshi has planned a special feast for all of us. The truth is that Kholi sahib was quite taken by Jaya at first, but after I explained to him that she was being coveted by another fine gentleman from abroad, I then steered him towards Lalita. Balraj, you are a very lucky man. Jaya's had many suitors before, with her great beauty and fine figure, but none were good enough for her. You two will make a fine couple, and you'll have no regrets on your wedding night. Lalita... Jaya... I need some help in the kitchen. Tsst-tsst. Come on. Come, come. Come on. Come on, Bejali. Whew. Power walking. It's so healthy. Everyone in LA is so healthy. They all like to exercise, but not read. Oh, no, no, there are great bookstores, too. Word up. There's nothing you can't find in LA. Nothing? You sure you don't miss some things from here? Well, to be honest... ...what I do miss most is companionship. You know, it can get very lonely in such a big place, and... Lalita, I like you. You're very peppy and bright, and I want to marry you and bring you back right away. - I've spoken to your mother... - You already spoke to my mama? Yes. She's very enthusiastic about the marriage. I'm sorry. You should have spoken to me first. I'm not ready to be married. I... I really can't accept. Well, Lalita, I'm offering to take you to Amrika, huh? You and your family will have no more worries. I could never be the kind of wife that could make you happy, and I don't think you could make me happy, either. You know, I work for some of the richest people in Amrika. I have savings and bonds and stocks, and you wouldn't even have to work. But I like working. OK. OK. Oh. You know, you may never get such a good offer like this one again. I'm sorry. It's too... too much tension for me now. She is happy to let us all be ruined. You must speak to her, old man. She wants love to be there from the beginning. Where was the love, Sha, when we first got married, huh? Tell her. Tell her that you marry first, then love grows. I'll never speak to her again if she refuses him. Lalita, do you understand what your mother is saying? She is saying that she will never speak to you again if you do not marry Kholi sahib. No? Yes. And I will never speak to you again if you... do. What?! Thank you. Ahh! Oh, Khol... Kholi sahib. Where are you going? Listen to me, Kholi sahib. Listen to me. Please don't leave like this. Kholi sahib? Kholi sahib. Kholi sahib... Kholi sahib, please listen to me. Oh, my God. Kholi sahib, I'll talk to her. Just listen to me. I'm sure she will understand, Khol... Oh! Jaya, Balraj is here! Kholi sahib. Kholi sah... I thought you weren't leaving until next week. I know. I'm sorry. I've just found out that I have to be on the next flight back to London. Some important business has come up that just won't wait. - Hang on one sec. - Where are you going? Kiran and Darcy want to go home, too, so... Yeah... I understand. But I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back, OK? Well, I... suppose I better go. Everything OK? Bye. Mama?! Mama? Mama?! You won't believe what has happened. Jaya, Lalita, come fast! - You won't believe this! - What is wrong, Lakhi? Papa, Kholi has proposed to Chandra Lamba. - What?! - What? - No, I bet she gave him two tight slaps. - No. She said yes, and you know what? They're having a small temple ceremony here and then a big American wedding in LA. No. I can't believe my best friend would do that. One billion Indians, and she had to go and marry one of the stupidest? People do horrible things for money. - And a green card, too. - No, no, no, no. But on the inside, Chandra's not like that, I'm telling you. Not everyone can stand up to the pressure the way that you can, Lalita. Better single than unhappy... I have to go. My mates are waiting for me in Varanasi... and I don't want to go, but I don't want to desert my mates, either. Oh. Of course. Of course you should go. I knew you wouldn't stay forever. Johnny! Wait. You can't leave without me! Oh. Ugh! - Ohh. - Ohh. - Lakhi. - You'll come back now? Maybe, yeah. And don't you dare remove this, OK? You know, it's bad luck if you do, and you promised you wouldn't. All right, well, um... well-well, I better go, OK? I don't want to miss that train.

She'll pick up. Hello. Bakshis' residence. Yes. Why, hello, Kholi sahib. Really? That's very kind of you. It's really too much. Chandra wants us to be at her wedding in LA. They're sending us four tickets. Come on. Hi, Chandra. Four tickets. So good to hear you sounding so happy. Jaya, we can stop over in London. You can meet Balraj again. Hello? Is that Kiran? Hi. It's Jaya Bakshi from Amritsar. Actually, we were just passing through London. Really? OK. We'll come by today, then. Great. Bye. See? How nice to see you all again in our part of the world. The Thames... Windsor Castle... Oh, flag's up. Queen's at home. The queen. So many lovely paintings. - Is that an Andy Warhol? - Wrong decade. We have several originals Mummy found in Barcelona. Oh, Italian. How nice. Do sit down. Lakhi! - Hey! - Oh, my God, Johnny! How are you? Oh, my God. What on earth are you doing here? Oh, I came here to surprise you. You have, and it's a lovely surprise. Thank you. We brought her over from India. Don't know how we'd manage without her. Won't Balraj be joining us for tea? Oh, no, didn't I tell you? Balraj isn't here. He's in New York with my parents. No... you didn't tell me. Yeah. They want him to meet a couple of girls out there. Cake? Lemon one's low fat. Flight 714 to Los Angeles is now ready for boarding. Would all first-class passengers please make their way to Gate 37. Lalita? - Hey. - Hello... Hi. I was just checking in, and I... You're on your way to LA? - Yes. We are going for Kholi's wedding. - Oh, of course. Yeah, we have him booked into our hotel in Beverly Hills. It's beautiful in the garden for a wedding. - Oh, should we be getting on, too? - Not yet, Mama. They let first class on before everyone else. I hope we are in better seats this time. Ooh, it was so crowded and noisy coming from Delhi. Yeah. I've just had a meeting in London. On my way home. Well, it's nice to see you all. Maybe I'll see you at the wedding. Thank God we're in economy. One thing I asked - not to be near the toilets. How will we sleep with all the flush noise and the doors banging? Hello. - Pretty cramped back here, huh? - Yes. - No leg room for my blood circulation. - Well, Mrs. Bakshi, I was wondering if you'd like to exchange seats with me in first? No, we're fine, thank you. Really, young man? Me in first class? Are you sure? Yes, please. It's the least I could do to repay you for your hospitality. Show me. Come. Show me. Well, who could have guessed he'd be so thoughtful? Another glass of champagne, madam? Yes. Thank you. Well, your mom's very happy. Thank you, but... you really didn't need to do that. Oh, well, it's a very small price to pay if it means I get to sit next to you for the next ten hours and 53 minutes. Well, I... do intend to sleep for at least ten of those hours. Yeah. So how's Wickham? Don't know. Haven't heard from him. Well, that sounds just like him. Why do you hate him so much? Listen, Lalita, some things are best left unsaid. You know I wouldn't lie to you. You just have to trust me that he's a nasty piece of work. I would hate it if he ever hurt you. I wanted to tell you in India, but, uh... Well, I'm glad that I can warn you now. Warn me? Let's just say it's a good thing that he hasn't been in touch. And I guess, the way you two were dancing... I was a little jealous. What's going on with Balraj? He never wrote or called Jaya ever since India. You know, he and Kiran, they know a fair bit about pressure from their parents, too. I guess we all do. From what Johnny said, I hear your mother's no different. Yeah. Well, I don't know what "Johnny" told you, but... my mom's probably not the best judge on marriage. You know, I think sometimes the only reason my parents stayed together as long as they did was 'cause they lived in separate countries. You know, I want to marry someone that I can't wait to see every day. We're not gonna get any sleep in these chairs. Get used to it. Take your arm off my armrest and keep your leg to your side. Hmm. ♪ Hey, must be the money ♪ If you wanna go and get high with me ♪ Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y ♪ Oh, why must I feel this way? ♪ Hey... - Welcome. - Hello. ♪ Hey, must be the money ♪ Must be the money Hey. It's all good. And this is the en suitebathroom. This one has a hot tub bath with super jets. Oh! Oh, you must see this closet. Just look at the space. Chandra has this entire side for all her 51 wedding suits. - 51?! - And that's gonna be the gym. And that's my crib. It's a nice-looking house. - Ah, thank you. - Very nice house. I know what you're thinking, - but he's a good man. - Hello? I'm not romantic like you, Lalita. I didn't want to take the chance in case my prince never came. I know he's not for you, but... but he's kind, and... and adores me. And I love it here. Chandra, I'm truly happy for you. I... I think I was a bit too quick to judge him. I'm sorry. It's fine. Beautiful, isn't it? Yes, Kholi sahib, it's lovely. The ceiling's so high. To think my wedding's gonna be here? Just put those figures on my desk. Oh, here we go. Hi. Hey. Mr. Darcy. - Hello, everyone. - Good afternoon, sir. Isn't it great we're all together again? Only this time, we have home-court advantage, no, sir? OK, why don't I show you around? Mmm. That's very good, Paul. Excellent. I'll put the order in today. Mm. Mm! Will! Mother. I'd like you to meet the Bakshi family. So these are Kholi's relatives. Such a pleasure to meet you, madam, and your lovely hotel. It's... first class. So tell me everything about India. I've always been fascinated by it. India's such a huge country, I wouldn't know where to begin. It's always been a dream of mine, ever since I was a little girl, to go there. I was devastated when Will said that I shouldn't go. Oh, that's not what I said, Mother. I said that it might be hard for you to travel there. But you're the one that didn't want to buy the hotel there. The board wanted to. Oh, everybody has their hand on India these days, but Will refused. Well, that was for lots of reasons. In fact, it was Lalita who helped me make that decision. A decision that lost us a fortune. Well, there's so much to see in India, Mrs. Darcy. You must come sometime. Well, if I had a hotel, I might have, but what with yoga and spices and Deepak Chopra, the wonderful Eastern things here, I suppose there's no point in traveling there anymore. Well, I don't know about that. People haven't stopped going to Italy because Pizza Hut's opened around the corner. Yeah, right. Yes. Ah, Georgina. Oh, hey, Georgie. Hey.Hey, come here. Everyone... I'd like you to meet my little sister Georgie. - Hi. - Hi. So this is Lalita. Yeah. Oh, Will told me all about your fab time together in India. Food poisoning, being ravaged by mosquitoes... Not your brother's idea of a perfect holiday. There were lots of things I liked about it. Well, I hope I get to hear you play guitar while you're in town. What? Yeah, Will said you played beautifully. No. He's just exaggerating. No, my brother never lies. Lunch. He's one of the most eligible bachelors in this town. You should be stirring your husband's dinner, not trouble. Darcy was just being friendly. Very friendly. After meeting his mother, I even felt a little sorry for him. I think what changed your mind was seeing the size of his hotel. Oh, hello? Ah, hello, Mr. Darcy. What can I do for you? Oh, Lalita? Well, why, yes, she's just here. Uh-huh. Here's to the only person I've ever seen stand up to my mother. I hope I wasn't too rude. Trust me, it's good for her. Reminded me of when I first arrived in India. Here I am, I'm trying to deal with everything, and then boom. You jump straight down my throat. - I didn't know what had hit me. - You deserved it. Oh, come on. Sí, señor! I really like this place. It's... It's not at all where I expected you'd take me. Aha. You see? I told you you misjudged me. The band is great. Why don't you show 'em how it's done? - No. No, no, no, no way. - No, I guess your guitar playing can't really compare to your sister's snake dance. ♪ Show me the way ♪ Take me to love ♪ Things only hurt ♪ Now I want to feel ♪ Nights are caressed by silken breeze ♪ Whisper secrets to listening trees ♪ Show me that world ♪ Take me to love ♪ Ohh-ohh-ohh ♪ Show me the way, take me to love ♪ Come out, blue moon ♪ I need a friend soon ♪ To share what I'm feelin' for him ♪ Shine down on me ♪ So I can see ♪ The silver street that leads me to ♪ The place I want to be ♪ Show me the way, take me to love ♪ Show them the way, take them to love ♪ Things only hurt ♪ Now they want to be ♪ Two beings with one beating heart ♪ For their whole lives not to part ♪ Show them the world, take them to love ♪ Ohh ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ Show them the way ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la ♪ Take them to love♪ La-la la-la-la-la-la ♪ La-la-la-la la-la-la ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ Ohh ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la... ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ La-la-la ♪ La-la-la-la ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ Ohh Hey, how you doing?

I can't just forget Balraj like that, Mama. Please don't make it any worse. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second? You look more comfortable this time. It really suits you. - There you are. - Listen... - Hi, Lalita. - Hello, Mrs. Darcy. Uh, I'd like you to meet Will's girlfriend Anne. Lolita. That's such a cute name. Like the movie, right? It's, um, Lalita. Nice to meet you... Anne. ...Anne. This is so much fun. Look at all the colors. Just imagine, she would have missed all of this, so I insisted that she come on the plane from New York with me. Lalita, doesn't Anne look wonderful in Indian clothes? Oh, stop that, Catherine. She's too kind. You look lovely. Shall we go? The ceremony is starting. ...comfort her and keep her in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live? Yes, I do. Chandra, do you take this man as your lawful husband, to love, honor and comfort him and to keep him in sickness and in health as long as you both shall live? Yes, I do. By the power vested in me by the state of California, I hereby pronounce you, man and wife. You may kiss. - Hi. - Hey. - You OK? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Sure. - The ceremony was so beautiful. - Yeah. - They both look really happy. - Mm-hmm. So I guess the next Indian wedding I'll get to go to is Balraj's. Well, that's if he and my brother make up. What do you mean? Well, he and my brother aren't really talking much right now. Yeah? Why? Um, he didn't tell me everything, but I guess Balraj met someone in India, and Will didn't think she was right and ended up having to talk him out of marrying her. Your brother talked him out of it? Oh, no, he was just looking out for him. The girl's mom was a total nightmare. She was a gold digger out to nail a rich hubby for her daughter. Is that scary, or what? Oh, there's Will. I'm sorry. I... I gotta go. Lalita, wait. Please give me a minute to explain. Look, I'm sorry about Anne coming. - I didn't know. - I don't give a damn about her. I hope you two are very happy. I don't love her. Look, my mother never told me that she was inviting her. Look, it's not my business what you and your mother do. Yes, it is. Look, Lalita... I love you. And I hated seeing you with Wickham in India, and I tried my hardest to forget you, but I couldn't. I know this sounds totally crazy. My mom's gonna flip out. but I don't want you to leave. Only you could say that you love me and insult me at the same time. What? You tried to forget me. Loving me is crazy. I'm not good enough for your mother. And you think I'd want to leave my family for you after you've ruined my sister's life? - OK, hold on, hold on. - Georgie told me. You talked Balraj out of marrying Jaya. Yeah, yeah, I did, but I have my reasons. And you ruined Wickham's life, too. Look, just let me explain. We may not have your family's money, but that does not make us inferior to you. I'm being honest with you here, all right? My family are not gonna be jumping for joy about it. I'm telling you that I don't care. When I first met you, I thought you were rude, arrogant, intolerant and insensitive. But over the last few days, I thought maybe, maybe I made a mistake. But I was right. You're the last person I'd ever want to be with. Hey, Mr. Darcy, how you doing? Hey, Kholi, is Lalita here? I'm sorry, sir. You missed her. - What? - I already took them to the airport. They're on their way to London. You want to come in for a beer or something? I'll get it! It's so tragic. Not a single proposal. So sad. So sad. My fate is to live in that rotten house full of spinsters and no grandchildren. - Don't worry... - Everything will be all right. Everything will be all right. Mama, I was thinking... can I go shopping? - Go, Lakhi. Go. - Thank you, Mama. If we are not bringing back any husbands and she goes shopping, at least we won't be going back empty-handed. Hey... what's wrong? We almost did have a proposal. Proposal? Who? Will Darcy. Darcy? I know that sounds crazy. What did he say? That he loves me. And what did you say? Hello. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm so happy to see you. - Good to see you. - How long you been waiting? - Very long. - Shall we go? - Yeah. It's from Lakhi. Oh, God. - Darcy... - Lalita... I feel like I owe you an apology. - This isn't a good time. - Lalita, please, just... I'm sorry about Jaya. I wasn't sure whether she really loved Balraj. I thought your mom was just pushing her. I was an idiot. I've apologized to Balraj, because I know that he still loves her. - He'd like to see her if... - I don't have the time for this. - Wickham has... - Wickham is a liar. He got my sister pregnant when she was 16, and he ran off, and he tried to marry her for my father's money. I stopped him, and I had to pick up the pieces. Oh, my God. - What? - Lakhi. Lakhi has gone off with Wickham. What? Lakhi went out shopping yesterday, and she never came back. Mama's sick in bed. Papa is here from India with the police. They can't seem to find her anywhere. Wickham! Lakhi! Know where he is? So beautiful. I love it. He left with some bird. Said something about the London Eye. Smile. I don't know. - Oh, my God, Johnny. - Hey. I want to go on that. - I want to go on that, too. - Lalita. Lakhi! Lakhi! Oh, my God. Bollywood. Go away! No! Go away! - Johnny, there's two seats. - Mm-hmm. - Darcy. - Lakhi. Lakhi, let's go. Hey! Lakhi, you don't... Lakhi, come back! Johnny, come on! What are you doing? - Lakhi. - Johnny. Just... stop it now. Leave him. Let's go. Lalita, not him, please. Anyone - Ohh. Don't you dare. Lalita, it was always you! Ooh. I'm so sorry. Let's call Mama and Papa. Papa. - Oh, Lakhi! - Ohh... Oh, thank God you're safe. - Mama, I'm so sorry. - What sorry? No boy is coming within ten miles of you until you get married. Mama, Papa, it's Will who found her. Oh. Thank you so much, sir, for bringing her home. - We're really indebted to you. - No, really. Lalita, help him clean up his face. - Balraj is here. - Tell them. Yes, yes. There's an important news. - Your sister is getting married. - Yes! - Oh, my God, Jaya! - Lakhi! Lakhi. Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. - It's a long story. Hey, congratulations. - Thank you. - Jaya. - Come on, come on, sit down now. Come, come, Darcy. Sit down, sit down, sit down. She's fine. She's back now. She's fine. Jaya, relax. Balraj, now that we are one big family, why don't you find our Lalita a nice Indian husband? Don't you have any cousins? That's nice. Will you have a look at these? Balraj, a family is a family, yeah? I'm so happy for you, Jaya. I told you, the moment he saw you, he was yours. I didn't think it would ever happen for me. But it did. About 20. Jaya! Balraj is already here! Beautiful. Coming. Where's Darcy? He'll be there somewhere.
