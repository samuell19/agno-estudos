A Nobuhiko Obayashi Film Miyuki Miyabe's RIYUU "THE MOTIVE" Directed by NOBUHIKO OBAYASHI Arakawa Ward spreads along the Sumida River in eastern Tokyo. It is known as the hometown of those gentle people who have warm hearts. It began as a ferry point for water transportation 1200 years ago. In the 17th century Senju Bridge was built as the gate to town. The town thrived as more people settled and enjoyed themselves. The 1923 Great Earthquake of Tokyo changed it into business quarters. Arakawa Ward was born as one of the 35 wards of Tokyo City in 1932. 45% of it was destroyed in the war but people rose from the ashes. Japan's postwar fast economical growth helped urban development. But many alleys and rows of small houses were left untouched. After the war the young people who were born and bred in this town preferred suburban life and went away and only old folks remained. The landscape of old streets and weathered houses is disappearing. This story begins in Koto Ward downstream of the Arakawa River. Koto Ward Police Station September 30, 1996 Prologue NOBUKO Stolen item: bicycle. Prologue NOBUKO Stolen item: bicycle. Color red. Type: woman's bike. Stolen from behind the school's library. What is the world coming to? My fault. I left it there. You don't have a seal do you? I need it for the report. Hi Nobuko? Your grandma left home? Come here Nobuko. They know about you. Are you friends? Who knows what? Tell me. Nobuko skipped basketball practice. Oh, you're a point guard on the team. She'll get all of us in trouble. She shouldn't be wandering around. Fortunately I found her. Don't play hooky. They'll hold all of us responsible. What's the matter? Come on in. Nobuko? Nobuko Katakura You said you'd never wear your inn's clogs because they were unsanitary, didn't you? Your grandma is missing? Nobuko's family has been running the inn. But her mother wants to close the inn. So her grandma got angry. She left home but returned at night. The family was quite frantic. The man in the magazine is there. In the paper too. The criminal of the... ...multiple murders. Is he at your inn right now? He's not condemned yet. He's just a suspect. His name is Ishida. He's been at large for four months. Nobuko you should calm down. Let's be sensible. Why would a murderer like him stay at your inn? Your parents could have identified him easily. Mr. Ishida's really there. My parents know who he is. Really? Mr. Ishida asked me to go to the police station and bring a cop. He looks really weak and can't walk a long way. He said he's tired and wants to give himself up. Please come. Come to the inn. Nobuko's not lying. You should go. You'll get credit for catching him. You both stay here. Sure. Officer? You're like a schoolteacher. Nobuko? Honestly, Mr. Ishida isn't a killer. I believe you. He's really suffered. I pity him. I see. I believe you Nobuko. Thanks. But the multiple murders... I never thought I could get involved in that case. I remember. It was five months ago. Past midnight on June 2. Chapter 1 INCIDENT It was pouring rain with lightning... a storm. Chapter 1 INCIDENT It was pouring rain with lightning... a storm. Oh, I found the body here. I found out later he'd fallen from the 20th floor veranda. I found him with Mr. Sato. Super Sano Tenant Sato Apparently he was a young man. He was wearing a shirt. He was dead, so we didn't touch him. No, he was laying face down with his hands like this. It was raining so hard. Mr. Sato called the ambulance. I called the ambulance. I'll call the police. I went to the office and told my wife... Day of the Incident June 2, 1996 Naoko, call the police! Day of the Incident June 2, 1996 Day of the Incident June 2, 1996 Hello, this is the office of the New City Condos in Arakawa. It's an accident. It was a police matter. Neighbor Kasai I left the office after one. Yes 1 a.m. I always work till midnight. Because of the weather I called car service. But the driver was new here. The streets around here are like a maze. So I had to stay awake listening to the radio. I told the driver to go to the basement parking area. It was a little before two o'clock. My husband was home so I hurried to the elevator. Only one elevator works at night, though there are many others. Especially after 11 o'clock. It's really annoying. Car No. 4 was on the 20th floor and it was coming down. Someone was going to the parking area. No one would walk in that rain. But it stopped on the first floor. It had been five minutes but I was irritated. I didn't know what they were doing. When it opened I hesitated. I waited for him to come out. I felt there was a passenger inside. I'm pretty psychic. I got in. I knew it was blood. I wasn't scared I thought they carried out an injured person on the first floor. The surveillance video was checked. A tall man, his back to the camera and his head down, was caught on tape. We couldn't tell the color of his clothes. No, it wasn't the dead man. I didn't recognize him. Oh, Ms. Kasai was also on the tape. After this man got off she got in on the parking lot floor. As she said it showed her looking at the blood. When I got to the 20th floor I heard the ambulance approaching. I thought I guessed right and I was relieved. When I approached Room 2025 there were several blood spots near the gate. So the accident happened in this room. But I couldn't remember who lived there. That's normal in a complex. I closed the gate. The door was slightly ajar. That time... I saw a shadow flashed. I didn't hear footsteps. But I saw him. This statement caused problems later. This is a very unlucky apartment. There are some houses and rooms like that. I don't mean people moving in and out often. People who mean to stay are forced to leave for various reasons. The first to buy Room 2025 was a newlywed couple. Oh, hello. This is Toshiko. The husband was a son of a wealthy family. But soon after they moved in they divorced. Are they on it? The wife got the condo but she sold it in a year. So the current owner is Mr. Koito, the third owner. Mr. Shinji Koito was a clerk. But I couldn't recall the name. There was no nameplate. They were a couple in their forties with a school-age child. So the victim wasn't living there? No matter how hard I tried I couldn't remember if I met Mr. Koito. I met Mrs. Koito. She signed the contract. No impression. They were good tenants. They made no trouble. Not a family likely to cause a bloody incident, or have someone falling from the veranda. I really didn't know what to think. "SATO" Ayami's scream woke me up. I lay in bed wondering what it was. Then Ayami rushed in. I saw a man fall outside the window. I finished my work and came to watch the weather on TV. Before two o'clock. Too early for news. A still weather map with music was on. I opened the window to look at the sky. I hate lightning and I wanted it to pass. Just then I saw it. She said she saw someone fall. So my husband went out on the veranda. It was so windy and he was soaking in an instant. Call an ambulance. Call the super too. So I called the police and the super. Someone fell. Yes. I was upset so I don't remember what I said. My son came in. Please come right away. Hiroshi... Dear? I'm going downstairs. Look after Mom and Ayami. I was glad we had a boy. He should be dependable. I waited for Mr. Sano. We both went to the scene. Oh, Mr. Sano. Someone fell from there. This way. That's my room there. - So... - Where? He fell from there? If I go alone I might be in trouble. They always suspect the one who found the body first. Then the ambulance came. - A jumper? - I think so. - No touch? - No, we made sure of it. So far so good but... After that... You called us? Someone got hurt in a fight? No! Someone else had called the police? My first experience. But I sensed there had been a mistake. They seemed to suspect Mr. Sano and me. Of course I had nothing to be afraid of. But was it a mere coincidence? A man got hurt in a fight. Some men beat him up. They fled. That's what the police were told. It was all mixed up. So they questioned us thoroughly. Don't shoot this lady. Turn that off! I said my sister saw someone fall. They said why we didn't call the police first. I was amazed. The man might be alive. Save him first. He couldn't have been alive. Sato residence. I'm sorry, the TV crew is here right now. Yes, about that incident. Then a second police car came. - You called us? - It's here. We took the police up to Room 2025. There's blood in front of Room 2025. This way. Mrs. Kasai from Room 2024 told us about the blood stain. Hello? I'm Kasai, Room 2024. I got a call. Oh Dear? There's blood near Room 2025. This way. As she said there was darkening blood near the door. Here it is. The door was closed. So the cop put an ear to the door for any sound in the room. Excuse me. I'm Sano the super. It's open. I turned around... Mrs. Kasai was almost crying. I hoped the police would let her go immediately. The light switch. Don't turn it on. The door between the hall and living room was open. So we could see from the hallway, by the flash of lightning. I guess they didn't want to touch anything. The police searched in darkness. Over here. Here's another. We went back to the room. Here. The room was in disarray, bedding in the middle. The sheets were rumpled. I first saw a hand. Next two legs jutting out. They were thin boney legs. An old woman. Does she live here? I didn't know she was in the family. Don't you know? Who lives here? I got more and more confused. I think I kept apologizing. This one was younger. She'd fallen curled up like a baby. The cop checked her pulse but even I knew she was dead. The back of her head was bashed in and bloody. I saw a man who was laying face down half out onto the veranda as if... he'd crawled there before he died. But there were marks in the blood so he must have been dragged. His whole head was a bloody pulp. Family members? Reporting murders... I was in a daze. Their eyes were closed. If not I would have run out of the room. I went to the veranda. The wind was still blowing hard. A blue vinyl sheet had been spread out held down by planters. But it was flapping furiously. Then many more officers appeared. I just did what I was told. The forensics people wore blue work clothes like in the movies. It was almost like watching TV. The man Ms. Kasai saw walking around... Was he the... ...same man in the surveillance tape? That meant someone had fled from this room. But no one knew who this man might be. It's been five months. I come and open the windows to air the room from time to time. Condos were investments during the economic bubble. Then the bubble burst. There are 22 empty rooms in two towers. Half have been vacant for over a year. But Room 2025 has a different atmosphere. Call it unlucky... Shooting is hard work. It's not as bad as it was initially but we still get press interviews. Mr. Koito and his family were registered in 2025. Shinji Koito (41) Salesman Wife: Shizuko (40) Boutique clerk Son: Takahiro (10) Schoolboy That's how they are registered. It's dated April 1, 1992. When it happened I never imagined that all the four people killed in that room had been strangers. It was an entirely different family. How could that be? Chapter 2 TENANTS I got a call from the police Chapter 2 TENANTS I got a call from the police when it was still dark on June 2. Hama Afternoon School This is Hamashima School. I'm Takako Koito. Yes, Shinji is my brother. Anything wrong? I knew they had moved to the condo but we've been estranged for years. Yet he listed me to contact in case of an emergency. I asked the office if something happened but they said they didn't know. I gathered something happened in the condo and several people got involved. So I got directions and went in my car. I didn't have a clue. I was worried about Takahiro my nephew. I remember an incident. It was five years ago... He called me. He rang me up in the dead of night. Hello? Oh, Shinji. You're calling at 3 a.m. to borrow 5 million yen? Shizuko put you up to it? It might be a steal but it's a lot of money. How can I come up with it? What about Takahiro's school? It's private but third rate. It had to be a private one. Not for Takahiro but for Shizuko's pride. He finally was adjusting and now this. For a sensitive boy like Takahiro a new school is stressful. One day Shinji called me and said... He can't relax at home. His wife is always asking for higher wages. You listened only to your wife not to me. He asked for it. I wanted to say "Serves you right!" but he's my brother. I pity him. I didn't know but his wife Shizuko was working in a boutique. When I visited, his son was alone. Oh, Takahiro. The house was a mess. Shinji's Son The house was a mess. Shinji's Son Doesn't she wash? "Doesn't she wash?" I couldn't help saying that. Anger seemed to give me energy. I cleaned the whole house and did the laundry. Then... What are you doing in my house? What are you doing? You hate me because I stole your lover. So you're trying to split us up. Shinji called me that night. Hello Shinji. Shizuko told me. Shinji Koito Shizuko told me. Shinji Koito You were wrong, I'm appalled. Shinji Koito You were wrong, I'm appalled. We're through. That's what he said. Next he asked for 5 million yen. The condo was worth 100 million yen they bade 82,5 million, but it was bought for 81,2. The couple divorced and the wife sold it for 72,5 million yen. I checked it out. It's fine. It's really a steal. I was horrified but Shizuko's family was wealthy. They were putting up 35 million yen. We're borrowing the rest but I'm 5 million short. So he asked me. It's not the money but the risk... I refused but he said before he hung up... You're the only family I have. See? It made me sad. I thought he had made a big mistake in life. Then the police called me. Yes I'll be right there. I rushed over to the condo. I thought they killed themselves because he couldn't pay back the loan and had to die. The rain had let up when I reached the condo. I told the officer by the squad car. I'm Takako Koito. We're expecting you. I met the detective in the office. I also met Mr. Sano the super. They told me everything they knew at that point. Where is Takahiro? He's only 14. He can't be the young man who fell. It's apparent. Let alone the young couple, who is this 80 year old lady? Shizuko's mother is barely 60. So I asked to see the bodies. They told me to go to the station. I went there in the police car. No, it's not. No! Not him! No! I gave the detective Shizuko's parents' phone number. Oh, I see. Good. They were staying in the spare apartment there. Both Shinji and Takahiro were alive. I was so relieved. We'll go talk to them in Hino City. Me too. No, this is part of our investigation. We'll take you home. I've been a teacher for a long time so I'm used to being involved. I was never shut out of important matters. So I was a little miffed. But as soon as my brother's family was found safe they got involved in this murder case. Four people died in this condo. Shinji is selfish and stubborn but he's got his good side. My parents worked hard and raised him right. He couldn't have done it. Impossible! They weren't living there and they didn't own it anymore. I never thought of it. Okay everyone. Open your books. The four victims who were murdered Chapter 3 KATAKURA HOUSE The four victims who were murdered Chapter 3 KATAKURA HOUSE early this morning have yet to be identified. Chapter 3 KATAKURA HOUSE early this morning have yet to be identified. Last night's storm has passed and the police are hard at work. The condo where the murders took place was built 13 years ago Owner Katakura was built 13 years ago Owner Katakura No one's safe anymore. We should be careful especially with all our guests. We should think about hiring security guards. Maybe... but we don't have the money. Our house is getting old too. The bubble has burst you know. Good morning. Going out? We have to try to take our chances. What is this world coming to? It's not easy for me to survive. Be careful. Katakura House. Living Quarters Playing video games in the morning? It's not morning anymore. A boring Sunday. I'm starving. Where's Mom? It's still early. Hey that's you. Grandma! Grandma what's wrong? Haruki, call Mom. Hurry up. We called the ambulance but she looked all right. They wanted to keep her for observation so I'll bring her some clothes later. Nobuko take care. But she was really in pain. She was faking it. She's no schoolgirl. She didn't have to. But Grandma said... It was probably food poisoning. No problem. She made it sound as if I poisoned her. She's being spiteful because I won't make Nobuko keep the inn going. Be careful Nobuko. There was a murder in Arakawa Ward. It's a boring Sunday. Nothing to do with us. Not a thing. At that point we didn't think that murder case... would eventually get us involved. Not a hint to it. Chapter 4 NEIGHBORS Shinji Koito has disappeared. They were gone by the time we got there. No! But it's true. Well they must know something. We'll go look for witnesses. It's legwork that solves these cases. You want to withhold the tenant name list? Is that the unanimous decision of East Tower? We do want the criminal apprehended. The murder happened in West Tower. But as citizens with rights even in a murder investigation personal information should remain confidential. That's the majority opinion. We like living in a condo because we can keep to ourselves. So I don't know anything about our neighbors. I mean it. Thanks. I'll be working in the next room. I have no idea who the person I saw that night in 2025 could be. He might have been the murderer. I think my words as a witness carry weight. He bothers me. My mother used to say what a big family our neighbor had. Sorry for shouting. My mom's hard of hearing. Only when it's convenient for her. That old lady - I'm old too, but she was older than I am. But she was well taken care of. Her daughter-in-law was sensible very sweet... And her husband... About 50. I wonder what his job was? He wore suits and used an umbrella to practice his golf swings. Her eyesight is still very good. The couple had a younger sister. Heavy makeup, loud clothes... I work in a bar so I'm pretty good judge of character What? She ignored me when I said hello. There was a son too. About 20 years old. He'd sometimes wear a suit but I doubt he was attending college. He was ill-mannered as well. There was a boy, a junior high student. He left early each morning his school must have been far away. Another man who was around 40 wore a suit and always seemed to be busy. I thought he must be a relative of some sort. But that means there were seven people in 2025. That's a big family. And four of them were murdered. One more question. Did you ever see all seven at the same time? Now that you mention it no... I saw them at different times too. I didn't see the old woman until this spring. Be quiet. We'll go soon. Are we done? Thank goodness it cleared up. I was still wearing my winter coat. The old woman in the wheelchair and the lady pushing her was in the elevator. Thanks for helping. She thanked me for helping her. Then... Is there a post office nearby? I told her to turn left at the gate and go to the second traffic light. She recited the directions as she walked to the gate. The woman in the wheelchair smiled all the time but did not speak. Her eyes were watery she couldn't see well. I thought they must have just moved in. This is where I saw that boy. It was just after New Year's. Hey you! He looked pale. I asked him if the boom box was broken. It's brand-new, and you're trashing it? Then I'll take it. I can have it fixed. You can't take it. If I don't dump it my mom will punish me. Your mother tells you to be wasteful? No... Then I'll take it. Anyone who finds it can keep it. Did you throw it away? You forgot this. You're his mother right? I was asking him if I could keep this. Who are you? We live on the 8th floor of West Tower. Liar. No one living here would pick through garbage. So I got pissed off. I'll have my mother visit you. Where do you live? Wait. You can't call me a liar and just leave. Suit yourself. What's wrong with your mom? She's ill. Don't take the boom box. It may be unlucky. We live in West Tower too. Which floor? 20th. We're the Koitos in Room 2025. But we're moving out soon. That's the only time I saw him. Like he said they must have moved. I hoped we could be friends. Sorry. When the Koitos disappeared... I knew it wasn't good. He could be the murderer. From the management company's point of view it's bad to have victims in a building. But it's even worse to have a murderer. But when you have both the damage is exponential. Know what this is? Yes, a slide. For emergencies. So the Koito family and the murder victims changed places in Room 2025? Yes they were squatters who moved in this spring. I don't know if they're pros or just people who were being used. Squatters? People who illegally occupy space instead of the legal occupants. As many condos are auctioned off these cases can happen often. But what for? This is from my granddaughter. Money of course. Money counts. That never will be my problem. "Restaurant Takara" "Closed Today" Chapter 5 SICK WOMAN I'm back. Chapter 5 SICK WOMAN So you were out. I did some shopping and came back. I was worried about Ayako. Studying? Playing. An essay I'm writing for the SF Club. How's Ayako doing? I don't know. Didn't Yusuke cry? Nope. Go peek in her room. I did but she isn't there. Ayako? Maybe she's gone shopping. Her bag's gone. Strange. She must have taken it. Dad's gone to see if her car's still here. Her car is gone. Riding with Yusuke? But she had a cold. Gone to the doctor? She would have left Yusuke... or said something. She'd have taken a taxi to the doctor's. I went out because you were here to watch her. Sis! She's burning up. What's wrong? Where were you? Ayako! You can ask her later. There was blood on the baby's wrap. I instinctively hid it. She's so cold. Yusuke where did your mom take you? The fender's dented. The car's muddy. It went through dirty water. When did you wash it? Day before yesterday. Was it there last night? It must have been. She was at home. But it's been driven some distance. Did she go out in that storm last night? So she caught cold? We didn't know she was home. You mean she left without telling me? This is not good. Maybe Ayako had another fight with him. Yeah it had to be him. But he's Yusuke's father. Ayako, where are you going? Bathroom. How could this happen? Because Grandpa died. She loved him. Because he spoiled her. When Ayako said "I don't want to go to school." He said "Oh sure." He was funny. When she confronted her teacher. Sir? I don't like to study. School is like hell. She caused a problem... That fool! It's not the amount of knowledge one has. That mindless foolish stupid oafish lout! He should go and finish himself! That was embarrassing. Sis liked this restaurant business. Don't be foolish. We did this to give you two a good education. Ayako is a loyal person. Call the ambulance! She had pneumonia but it wasn't serious. There's no need for us to stay. We must go. But we're her parents. We don't want Yusuke to get sick. I'll stay a little longer so take Yusuke and go home. Will I die... What? Do you think I'll die? You must be dreaming. Don't be afraid. Young people don't die of pneumonia. A shot of antibiotics can cure you. I mean...can I die? Come on. Where were you anyway? Today...last night? I want to die. I really want to die. Don't Sis... I... I killed Yuji. You did... In the news... that murder in Arakawa Ward? That's him. That's Yuji. I pushed him and he died. There were other bodies in that room. I was scared. Scared to death. The time was 8:05 p.m. on June 2. Frankly I was relieved when I heard that it wasn't a robbery case. A real estate deal was the cause. I'm sorry for the victims but real estate is a shady business. It didn't happen to me. But I heard a lot about problems with auctions and squatters. Late on the afternoon of June 2nd Mr. Koito went to the police Chapter 6 FAMILY ON THE RUN and things became clearer. When the police went to question him they ran away. But that night he turned himself in to a station near his hotel. The police said he was fleeing to Yamanashi. Dad, they'll find us if we're driving around. We should go back. His son urged him to surrender. I'm sorry. The police called early on June 2. Yes Shinji Koito is here. I'm Shizuko. Takahiro's here too. Takahiro was calm. It was my husband who was frightened. He was half-crying when he phoned... the real estate guy... the guy he asked to reclaim the condo. There's been a murder in Room 2025. The police are looking for us. What should I do? What should I do? What we did was against the law. To have someone live in an auctioned condo to try to get it back. That's illegal. We'll go to prison if we get caught. Let's run. If you won't I'll take Takahiro. We left by the back door. But he did it without my knowledge. My son and I were victims as well. He ruined my life. I don't even want to hear his name. I've had it. My son said driving around was not good. So we went to a hotel. Hachioji View Hotel June 2, 1996 My husband was exhausted holding the phone. My son went to him and said It's serious, four people were killed in our condo. I'm scared. So am I. I think running away isn't a good idea. Because you didn't kill anyone. It was only one of many cases we handled but it got so much press. It seemed to galvanize the public. Koito defaulted on his loan payments. and Room 2025 was put on the auction block. It was purchased by a Naozumi Ishida... yes the person of interest who went missing for 4 month. Koito had Ishida's name and address so we went to Ishida's home. He lived in a rented apartment near Urayasu, Chiba. He lived in Room 202. It was the evening of June 2... Heim Eiwa June 2, 1996 Where are you? You didn't even go to work. The police are here. They want to see you. They came a while ago. Is that so? Well you've been gone since this morning. A crime was committed in the condo you bought. Do you know? What? Where are you now? Come home. You must explain. Can I talk to him? "They won't believe me." "But I haven't killed anyone." "But I'm innocent. Take care of the kids." "I knew that condo was bad news." That's what my son said. You don't think he'll kill himself? Chapter 7 BUYER You don't think he'll kill himself? Chapter 7 BUYER We didn't know about this until two days later, Chapter 7 BUYER We didn't know about this until two days later, until June 4. It didn't break in the newspaper until the 5th. The purchaser's name Naozumi Ishida was already in the news. It was him on the surveillance tape on the night of the murder. Ishida's mother confirmed it. The police now were looking at Hayakawa, owner of Ikki Real Estate. A very shady character. It gave me the creeps to know he was involved. June 5, 1996 Hayakawa... Run! Hayakawa The police were rather embarrassed that this man was under their noses all along. The detectives kept returning so I was privy to what was going on. But Hayakawa had some redeeming qualities. He may have broken the law but Boss Hayakawa saved our lives. I hope he gets off lightly. It wasn't much but the toy shop was handed down from my father. When I couldn't pay back a loan it was auctioned. We'd have to leave as soon as the new owners arrived. It meant after all my life meaningless. I'd lost what was given to me by my father. It was like a magic trick. Hire someone to live here in the store. The new owners can't evict them easily. That's when he came. I'm Hayakawa. Mr. Takemoto told me about you. the new owners would sell cheap since there was a sitting tenant. Then he'd flip it for a huge profit. He'd give us a cut from the profits. So there came a scary looking guy and a sleazy looking woman. I'm sorry but we'll have to live here now. I'll take care of the things in the store. I love toys. He looked like a child. I was to blame for losing the store... I couldn't make a go of it. But we could get some money and move out and live in a place like this. It wasn't a bad deal. I hear they do this all the time. They've been doing it for centuries. That's what the lawyer said. But we wish to remain anonymous. That's the condition for this interview. Chapter 8 OBSTRUCTION "Lawyer Tomura's Office" Chapter 8 OBSTRUCTION Chapter 8 OBSTRUCTION I believe Ishida was a victim of the times. The inherent problem with real estate deals the process of auctioning the squatters who skirt the law. When I took Mr. Ishida's case I looked into the previous owner Shinji Koito, and this is what I found. Hello? Hi. Do you have a minute? This is Mr. Hayakawa. Koito met Hayakawa of Ikki Real Estate at the Akira Toy Shop. I'm Hayakawa. Here's my card. Koito was really a hard worker. His company made video game machines with an electronics company. We want your feedback on the new video game machines. It was a breakthrough. He was put in charge of development - a group leader. He was promised he'd get a job with the electronics firm. No new computer language needed for the software. Early summer, 1990 Oh excuse me. Times are bad when lawyers are busy. Koito was probably caught in a situation beyond his control. He canvassed all the small shops even down to the tiniest shops. He asked them for their comments. When he went to Akira Toy Shop he was introduced to Hayakawa. They accidentally met at the shop but they hit it off right away. Oh I see. Since his condo was being auctioned he asked Hayakawa for his help. Autumn, 1995 47,5 million yen? That's cheap. This is bad. Hayakawa thought of himself as something of a savior. They could have given him the chance to sell the condo and pay back the loan. The mortgage company could have agreed. But they foreclosed and auctioned. Why couldn't they have been more sympathetic? So I wanted to help those people. You might call it obstruction but... It's obstruction because he's obstructing the purchaser from living in the property. Ishida bought such a property so he's a victim as well. Including the fact that he fled that night he was a victim of circumstance. Chapter 9 HOUSE WANTED I still dream about it. Chapter 9 HOUSE WANTED Chapter 9 HOUSE WANTED I was never there Chapter 9 HOUSE WANTED I was never there but in my dream there's a lot of blood. It's probably my father's blood. June 1, the day before the murder, was my 20th birthday. On the 2nd I went to a movie then my girlfriend treated me to dinner. It was past 10 p.m. when I got home. When I got home a man in a suit came out. You're Naomi, Naozumi's son? Yes. I thought Dad was in trouble. Grandma was white as a sheet. I've never seen her quite so upset. Grandma told me about it. I thought the world had come to an end. "What have you done?" I was convinced Dad had done it. That's when the phone rang. I thought it was Dad calling. Everyone was watching me. My mouth was dry. It was from my sister. Oh, it's you, Yukari. If it was late or if it was raining my brother would come pick me up. My friends were envious. But that night he came with two men. It frightened me. Since my friend was in the car I didn't ask what it was. When I got home Grandma started crying. My brother told me about the murders and that Dad had run away. I felt sorry for my sister then and angry with Dad. But I couldn't get angry at Dad. I regretted I wanted to live in a condo. It was a mistake to try to buy it. When I was young. This bar was new. You see the chimney of Nittai from the window. It was 14 years old. Now you can see the condo's twin towers. For the murders in that condo, the press said this man Ishida was the suspect. I knew who it was right away. That was Mr. Ishida the driver. He used to come here quite often. About the time the chimney came down and the twin towers were built. The condo was built on Nittai property so no one else was evicted thank god. I headed the town association then. Yet... It's not pleasant you know, Mr. Ishida watching something new go up. I felt left behind. I worked for Nittai ever since I came to Tokyo as a teenager. I never thought when I quit that the company would disappear and a condo would go up in its place. You followed your boss to work for his new company. Did you get severance pay when you left? Sorry I wasn't eavesdropping... but I heard anyway. Did you make a go of it? So you got the short end of the stick. When a company fails a lot of people get hurt. But you should use your experience as a long haul driver and make lots of money, buy a condo on a high floor and look down on your old company. I was joking to cheer him up... I never dreamt that he would... I begged Dad to buy a house. He was desperate. You city folks prefer coffee to tea. I hope it tastes all right. Naozumi started working for Sanwa Transport. He started making a lot more money. They paid according to actual merit. He felt he could pay back a loan so he talked about buying a house. I said I wanted a dog. A big dog like a Saint Bernard. Their mother passed away right after Yukari was born. He would do anything for his children. But at first we were looking at houses. I didn't want to move. I liked my school and friends. Children get the strangest ideas. About that time there was an accident. A robbery-murder case. A mother and two children were killed while the husband was away. That really put him off the idea. His children meant everything to him. Then all of a sudden last autumn... It all started over an argument... Chapter 10 FATHER AND SON It all started over an argument... Chapter 10 FATHER AND SON Why does it have to be Tokyo University? Chapter 10 FATHER AND SON Chapter 10 FATHER AND SON Because it's good. Chapter 10 FATHER AND SON Because it's good. Toyo Tech University is third rate. Go to Tokyo University. Because it's famous? Doesn't this mean that you don't value your life? Yeah I'm just an uneducated driver. Are you saying your life was a waste? Don't you have pride? We're not talking about me. You think the value of a person is determined by which University he went to? You look down on yourself and co-workers thinking your lives are not good? Poor man! Yes I was just a child of a sweets shop. After junior high I went to Tokyo to work I got my truck license when I was 22. For what? It was all for you kids. I don't want to hear it. I have my own life. Don't you dare... Dad didn't come home that night. When we fight in our house it's the parent that leaves home. Isn't that strange? They usually get along very well. They rarely fight. So once they start they can't stop. But his regret that he didn't own his house was learned from his father. Naozumi's father - my husband Naotaka married into my family's sweets business. Matsue City has long been famous for sweets. What's worse Naotaka's mother was a trial bride. Do you know what that means? This was an old custom that was around until World War II. Before being married officially a bride lived with her husbands' family to see if she suited. Naotaka's mother didn't get along with the mother-in-law. She was sent back and later married someone else. But she was already pregnant. The child was adopted by a fisherman's family, and he grew up as the eldest of six children. He always said... They say women are homeless. I am a man but truly homeless. I kept telling him this is your home now. No, I just take care of this sweets shop, so I'm still homeless. Naozumi inherited this sentiment. He said he didn't want to inherit the sweets shop. Although he could have worked in a nearby city he was only interested in going to Tokyo. He probably wanted to get far away from what he thought was not his home. That made me very sad. When he left, my husband seemed to age eventually he died. Sachiko, the mother of these children, was a good wife to Naozumi. She was a relative of his boss at Nittai working for a credit union in Arakawa. They had an arranged marriage. But three days after Yukari was born she had a stroke and... I was living alone in Matsue so I came here to Tokyo with my husband's memorial tablet. I've only been back once to visit his grave. Dad looked sad and angry at the same time. He said "I'm not a good father" "I'm worthless" "I can't be of help to you kids." So I said to him That's not true. I love my family. I'm happy I'm part of this family. Brother was just angry and upset. When you're angry you say what you really feel. That's what Naomi truly thinks. He told Grandma he was leaving. Living alone is a rite of passage. You too? You want to leave too? You're taking this too seriously. We don't have a business to inherit nor a fortune that we have to protect. We're all free so let me do as I please. That's when he said... Is that so? It would be different if we had a fortune? That's what it comes down to? He was deep in thought and that's how he decided to buy a house. When I was a kid Dad was my hero. "Sanwa Transport Inc. Harumi Warehouse" "Chief of Outgoing Operations." A long title. That's my job. Chapter 11 HOUSE FOR SALE A long title. That's my job. Chapter 11 HOUSE FOR SALE It just means I'm in charge... Chapter 11 HOUSE FOR SALE Chapter 11 HOUSE FOR SALE of loading out operations. Chapter 11 HOUSE FOR SALE of loading out operations. I remember that night well. We were celebrating. Ishida's son Naomi was accepted into college we were happy for him so with Kanai in charge of refrigeration the three of us came to celebrate. We all had sons. It was in the spring, two years ago... This is on us tonight. You sure have your work cut out for you. Private colleges cost a lot don't they? But children are what keep you going. You lost your son Kanai. I lost a son too. He got into the college of his choice? Yes, Toyo Tech University. Not well known but my son's first choice. They have great teachers in his field. Ishida looked very happy. It must have been a little after that. He heard about the condo being auctioned. He didn't have enough on his own and wanted to know if we could help him. He wasn't pushy of course. I asked if it was risky but he seemed to have done a lot of research and the terms were good. His successful bid was 55 million yen. The original price of the condo was... 107,2 million. It was really a good bargain. Ishida was a steadfast man. He said this was his legacy for his kids. Let's drink to our future. We were really having a good time. But gradually Ishida became morose. He became very quiet. To tell the truth... the current residents won't move out. What kind of people are they? Something's going on. Something very strange. Chapter 12 YOUNG MOTHER Sis? Chapter 12 YOUNG MOTHER Chapter 12 YOUNG MOTHER Do you remember what you said that night? Chapter 12 YOUNG MOTHER Do you remember what you said that night? I do. You weren't dreaming were you? If only it wasn't true I'd be happy. It's in the news... There were three others... Yasutaka? Yeah? I'm sorry. You always apologize. In the news... they say this man Ishida did it. Then I won't get caught right away. That's the kind of man he is. Do you know Ishida? I met him that night. But when I went to see Yuji before the two of them were arguing. It was a month ago. So you were still seeing him. I thought you broke up with him. Sorry. Can I ask you something? Sure. Are you going to the police or are you going to keep silent? I want to be with my baby. I'll die if they take him from me. That day I got sick I knew I had to do something. But I couldn't. Watching Yusuke sleep I just couldn't. I'll protect you if I can. No, I'll protect you. I'm sorry Yasutaka. I really am. I want to kill him. I want to kill Yuji Yashiro. But he's already dead. Damn! I have no intention of marrying Ayako. What do you mean? I have no intention of marrying anyone. I do not believe in having a family. Is your belief more important than Ayako and the baby? Ayako knows how I feel. I don't want a child. That... was carelessness. There's no point in discussing this. That's all then. How selfish you are! I'm sorry. Don't be mad at him. He's suffered a lot. He didn't get along with his parents. So he doesn't know the love of a family. So he can't understand. About family parents children. No one has taught him. That's why I... I won't allow it. You are not to see him again. Promise me you won't see him again. What about the baby? The child of a man who doesn't care. I want it. It's mine as well. Did you tell Mom and Dad about Yuji? They were busy taking care of you and the baby. I couldn't burden them with any more. I wonder why I told you. Because it's easy talking to me. I guess. So you got back together with him. With Yuji. But that was my second visit to the condo. While we were apart he'd moved there. So he was living in Room 2025? The first time I visited I was surprised. It was luxurious. So the other victims were his family members? No. They weren't. The other victims were not his family. No. Not at all. Chapter 13 FAMILY WITHOUT A PORTRAIT Even after we moved I used to come here. Chapter 13 FAMILY WITHOUT A PORTRAIT Even after we moved I used to come here. We didn't move we fled in the night. All my school stuff was still here. And... Do you know what my mom was up to? She was getting cash. She bought appliances on her credit card then sold them to a middleman for cash. She used the money to repay the loan. She was just getting deeper into debt. But she'd buy things like a boom box, so I opened the box. Mom was very angry when she got home. I'm home, Tadahiro. You've ruined it. I tried to repack it as it was but in vain and Mom got angry. Go throw this out. Go right now. There were microwaves and stereos. So when I came back the first time I was surprised someone was living here. It was Satoko Sunagawa. She was surprised to see me too because I used my spare key to get in. Who are you? I'm... Are you Mr. Koito's son? Yes, I came to get some of my things. Hello. That was Tome Sunagawa. They were both very kind. We've rented this room from your parents. So please send them my regards. But if I told them, Mom would find out I was here and get hysterical again. So I said to them. Could I live here? My school's nearby. And you're much kinder than my Mom. She was at a loss as to what to say. Tsuyoshi was using my room then. But I never met him. He came home late only to sleep. The other man was always in the park. He pretended to play golf using his umbrella like this... Satoko! That was Nobuo Sunagawa. No, the police told me later. He was a salesman for a real estate company. Nobuo Sunagawa He was a salesman for a real estate company. Nobuo Sunagawa But he retired after he hurt his back and was hired by Hayakawa as a squatter. Thank you. I'll do my best. You're helping people too. Thank you. This is my room. I can be myself here. This room is full of memories. Our family album. We used to take pictures together. I made this myself. Once when I was looking at the album... How nice! Family photos. It was Mrs. Satoko. We don't have a photo album. My family lives apart. But they're gone now. I'm all alone. Chapter 14 THE LIVING AND THE DEAD Coffee and tuna sandwich. 370 yen. Chapter 14 THE LIVING AND THE DEAD Coffee and tuna sandwich. 370 yen. Hey, isn't your name Satoko Sunagawa? Yes. I knew it. You know... They say you were killed in a condo. A fruit sandwich. Must have the same name. It must feel creepy. Have a good day. My usual. It's fresh from the oven. Your name's in the papers. You know those murders in Arakawa? The other guy said so. I'll leave the paper here. A little past nine in the morning the sandwich stand closes for a break. During the break in the parked minivan right here... Satoko eats breakfast with the owners. The owner prepares the meal mostly for Satoko's sake. The owners are a retired couple who used their retirement money to open the sandwich stand. But since they were shy people they hired Satoko to operate the stand. That day the couple had brought some rice balls and warm miso soup. Thanks you so much. Thank you. They like you so the stand's doing great. You're a godsend. Oh, watch it you'll burn yourself. This...it's my husband. What? "The four murdered squatters who lived "in 2025 instead of the Koito family "Nobuo Sunagawa, wife Satoko, "son Tsuyoshi and his mother Tome." This is my family and me. You? But you're right here. Right. So this Nobuo... is he your husband who disappeared 15 years ago? But the names are all... Call right away. Here's the phone. Tsuyoshi. That's my son. The crime scene? All right. I'll go there later. I'll call again. Yes I saw the papers and thought it must be a mistake. We were just saying we should call you. Tome? Oh she's fine. I see, thank you. Satoko, your son's on the phone. We gave him the cellular number. Oh, Tsuyoshi? Hey Mom. Are you okay? I just read the papers. Do you really think it could be Dad? I knew something awful would happen. I have to go identify the body. You probably don't remember his face. Tsuyoshi, come home early tonight. I can't wait to see you. Sure. Thanks. Bad news? Good news. Perhaps she sensed something... My son's back. Nobuo's come back. The body was indeed my husband Nobuo. It was 15 years since I last saw him. The other three were not my family or me. They were strangers to me. So who was the Satoko who was killed in Arakawa? We now go to Ueda City in Shinshu. Chapter 15 HOMECOMING Ueda, Early Autumn, 1996 I really had to think about it. I know it sounds cruel but I was afraid of police involvement. Not of the trouble of burying her. We were always worried about Katsuko. Katsuko? She was my youngest sister. It's been more than ten years now since she ran away from home. She wasn't a calculating person. She took things to heart, very naive, fell in love all the time. She'd follow a man anywhere. Sanae my wife. I named the store after her. I worked in a bar in Tokyo when Sanae and I met it was her idea to renovate my family's restaurant. Now it's popular. This was taken shortly before she left. She's the one next to me. It was just when we renovated the place. She's pretty under all that makeup. She'd change depending on the man she was with. Right after this there was trouble with a man and she left. We had to put up with it so many times. One rainy fall day Katsuko left. On June 13, 1996... It didn't look like her but I knew. Blood is thicker than water. We went to the station in Arakawa and I identified the body as Katsuko. She was brought out from the morgue. The detective put flowers by her body. She was without makeup, smiling even... I thought Katsuko must have been happy... I understand she had been embalmed. The family is supposed to pay the fee after they identified the body. The cost of 150,000 yen was so real. So Katsuko never returned here. After she ran away she was murdered... It's been ten years since then. I wasn't born here but it's a lovely place in the valley. My sister returned. Not as Katsuko but Satoko Sunagawa. We're going to make sure she rests peacefully as Katsuko again. Following Nobuo Sunagawa and Satoko, real name Katsuko Akiyoshi we now know the identity of the third victim Tome Sunagawa. Her real name is Hatsue Mita, age 82. According to the attendant of the nursing home in Shizuoka... She just disappeared one day. She was very healthy for an 82 year-old. She went shopping that day. Usually she would be back by early evening but she never came back. We contacted hospitals and the police. Eventually they found her bag in a garbage bin near the station. Only her wallet was gone. Several witnesses came forward who saw a gang mugging her. Hatsue was dragged and fell and hit her head. She said she was fine but she sat down on a bench and looked disoriented. She must have lost her memory. We worried something bad had happened to her but someone kindly had helped her and she was leading a happy life. That's what we chose to believe. Her daughter and granddaughter identified her body. And her body was brought back here. The funeral was held here at the nursing home. This was her home. Those two left immediately without taking her remains. It's already fall now. Hatsue's remains are still with us. Even though you're not related by blood those who love you are your real family. Because of the Sunagawa family situation the police asked for the public's help. We received a lot of calls here as well. I didn't know there were so many missing people. Some were crank calls. Some people can be very cruel. I was saddened by the experience. It made me think. What kind of people inhabit this world? I wondered about the people who live in these condos that I supervise. Speaking of crank calls the first call to the police that night came from the East Tower. A woman came forward later. I saw people struggling. I'm positive. Day of the incident June 2, 1996 But it was raining so hard I closed the curtains. But I thought I should inform the police. Just calling the police frightened me. That's why I didn't give my name. I just said yes to whatever they said. I just wanted the police to come. I never dreamt it would turn out like that. But I tell you what I did see. In the stormy night, it was a baby. I'm a woman I could tell. A woman was running. She was holding a baby in her arms. She was running away. Yes, it was a woman. Not a man. Chapter 16 AYAKO Yuji had run away from home. Chapter 16 AYAKO Chapter 16 AYAKO His father was an alcoholic... Chapter 16 AYAKO His father was an alcoholic... He hadn't been home for years. "He's probably dead" he said. "My mother was a floozy always with a man "having their babies... I'm one of them." He left home right after junior high. They haven't discovered who he is yet. Although he was with Mr. Sunagawa Yuji didn't consider them family. He met him when he was 17 and pretended to be his son. But he said "But I'm a boarder. I get paid to be there." One day he said "Ayako I'm going to be rich." "I can get 10 million yen." "I have this great plan" he said. And this man Ishida was involved? Don't ask leading questions. Sorry. That day if Yuji hadn't come I would have given up on him. But he came. He kept his promise. He talked to Mom and Dad got yelled at and left. I wasn't just another girl to him. He's afraid of having a family. But Yuji and I can be a family. I can be his wife and his mother. When I first met Yuji he took me to his place. Where? Up on a roof in Tokyo. Beautiful stars were just overhead. I said to him "The stars looked almost within reach." Then he said "Don't reach for them." "I come here to look down on the stars." "See? There are many stars on the ground." "Someday..." Someday I'll pick up the stars in my hands... He said so. Spring, 1995 What a cute young couple. Where are you going? To the doctor. The baby has heat rash. Oh, you have heat rash. Hope he gets better. I wonder if babies dream. What is he dreaming about? I have to do something about Mr. Ishida. But he promised me. Promised? What I can't bear is... Remember Tokiwa my junior high teacher? When I said I wouldn't go to high school... You'll end up a loser. "See? I told you, didn't I?" He'd say so in his conceited way. Chapter 17 NOBUKO AGAIN "Katakura House" Mom's not home yet. Maybe it's for real this time. Why does my family run away all the time? She'll come home soon. She has no place to go. I guess so. Oh, miso soup. We don't do breakfast here. This is for our family. Do you need a room? You don't look good. Are you ill? No? We don't interfere with our guests. Just obey our rules. Room 4, on the second floor. It's at the end. Dad... I've seen him before. Hello. One second Nobuko. A customer? Teenagers are so fashionable now. "First suspect of murder..." Can I borrow this? Sure. She's still a kid. Should I go to the police? You stay here. Your Mom's back. She's frying dumplings in the kitchen. She knows fried food is bad for me. She wants to kill me. What's the matter? What...it's so messy in here. My name is Katakura. I'm Naozumi Ishida. Are you ill? I'm not sure. I have a weak liver but I've been running since June. I'm tired. No one's suspected you till now? No, even though I saw myself on TV. That was a strange feeling. Mr. Ishida? Don't think badly of us for calling the police. Your daughter recognized me? No, it was me. I haven't killed anyone. Please tell that to the police. They say a person of interest so they're not saying you are the murderer. Can you do me a favor? I'd like your daughter to make a call for me. Takarai Restaurant. Mr. Ishida? Mr. Ishida asked me to call you. He says he can't keep his promise to you. Hello? Hello? He'll be arrested so we should run, is that it? I don't know. He just asked me to call. Where is he? I can't tell you. I called anyway. A baby was crying. Grandma, dumpling. Chapter 18 FUGITIVE The world's a strange place. Chapter 18 FUGITIVE Chapter 18 FUGITIVE Even after I was cleared I'm still running. Chapter 18 FUGITIVE Even after I was cleared I'm still running. No, not from your people. Publishers say I can make a lot of money. if I told my story. A story when family ties are unraveling of murder bringing people together. It's a very modern topic. I bet the readers would love it. We'll ghost write it for you. We can publish it without your permission. Freedom of speech is guaranteed. Who cares if it's not true? That makes it more interesting. People's motives are unfathomable. People make up their own stories to keep on living. Of course I refused. I did want the money but my mother was against it. Don't even think of getting money that way. If you make money that way people would hate and resent you. That's how the world is. Haven't you learned your lesson? I want to forget everything. Just as this wound won't heal, it's not easy to forget. I got this fighting with Yuji Yashiro. I was trying to save Ayako and her baby. But time is a great healer. Now that things have settled down I wanted to tell my side of the story so that the public would know the truth. But now not many people are interested. The murders are a thing of the past. We'll leave this place for 10 million yen. That's what he said. I didn't believe him so I asked... Is this Mr. Sunagawa's idea? He doesn't know. But if you pay I can persuade him. "Sunagawa had been paid by Hayakawa "to break the law. He could put a stop to that." That's what he said. I didn't like it. So I talked to Sunagawa. He said 10 million yen? No, that's news to me. "Tsuyoshi might kill me. But if he did "you'll be accused of the murder" he said. So I decided to talk to them together and that's why I went there, to Room 2025 the night of the storm. The door was open so I went inside. The three of them were already dead. It was a scene from hell. He was on the veranda spreading a sheet. He was planning to wrap the bodies in it. Just then the doorbell rang. I knew it. Ayako said "I knew it." I didn't know her name then it was the first time I met her. Later I found out she came because she had a hunch. A woman's intuition? Ayako loved that man. But she didn't expect to see this. Why did you do this? Why? It's for you. Why try to interfere? Damn! It's all your fault. You should have taken the deal. Why can't I get what I want? The baby slept through the whole thing. Then Ayako said I'll call the police. Then he said Shut up! Just do as you are told. He meant it. I reacted. It happened in an instant. I didn't see it happen my back was turned. I heard a scream and when I turned he was no longer on the veranda. Ayako was crouched on the sheet. When I went to her... He fell. What? Ayako said she pushed him? I don't believe it. He must have fallen on his own. Ayako snatched the baby from my arms. She was protecting the baby with her body. I knew I had to protect this tiny life. So I said I didn't kill these people. But both you and I will be suspected. If you leave and say nothing I won't say anything about you. She nodded. There was a strange beauty in her face. Tell me. What's your name? Ayako. Ayako Takarai. She told me her real name. I was relieved. I kept my promise. That kept me going during those four months. I felt a deep bond with that girl. Tea. Thank you. Thanks for talking to us. Now I know what really happened. Oh, what is the baby's name? I never knew its name. The baby is Yusuke. The Yu is from his father. Story published in 1998 Screened in 2003 Chapter 19 SURRENDER I remember that girl Nobuko she was gripping the umbrella like this...she was protecting her dad. She was serious. It made me homesick she reminded me of my daughter. I didn't want them to think I was a killer. That's why I decided. I called again myself. I'll call. Ayako's father asked me to wait one night for them to sort things out. Ayako needed time to decide. Could you give me one night's grace? Mr. Katakura agreed. Day of Surrender In the car coming here my wife called telling me Ayako was at the police station. I sorry to have caused you trouble. And the baby? A neighbor is taking care of him today. The store's closed today. How can this be? Both of the baby's parents are murderers. Until she gets out we'll raise him. Go to the station and get the officer. Have them send the patrol car here. Sure. So why do I have to cry? Epilogue THE GHOST And so Mr. Ishida took possession of 2025 Epilogue THE GHOST Epilogue THE GHOST but he put it up for sale immediately. Epilogue THE GHOST but he put it up for sale immediately. But after what happened there were no buyers. The Koito boy still visits. Other than that no one comes at all. I believe the boy is the owner of the place. I don't want anything. Precious things always get lost. The Kitabatakes in 2026 moved away. The mother moved into a new nursing home. We had nothing to do with what happened next door. Leave us alone. Visitors? No. I feel nostalgic. I asked to be a boarder here, remember? I think it would be easier living here. But that Tsuyoshi... no, that wasn't his name the guy who fell was also a boarder. His name was Yuji Yashiro that's what they say. Yuji Yashiro I can't remember when the rumors about the ghost started. Yuji's ghost. A pale man looking down from the veranda of Room 2025. When yours eyes meet he falls into darkness. No, I haven't seen him. What's strange is that it's Yuji's ghost not one of the others. And the shadow Ms. Kasai saw that night? No one was alive in that room at that point. Was Yuji's ghost already walking? I saw it. I really did. I don't care if no one was alive by then... I really saw it. I told this story a hundred times. The same thing over and over again. Even at school. I felt like a celebrity. Now I'm not sure if I really saw him fall or if I saw his ghost. I don't know. He was the enigma. He was the monster. But I'm just like him. I think about this a lot. If I had lived with them, and if they got in my way would I have killed them? Would I have killed them? "Could I have killed them?" "That is Takahiro's question." "Yuji himself will not know the answer." "Yet in the not too distant future there may be an answer." "It might appear or be made to appear." "Only then can Yuji leave this earth till then he will wander the West Tower." "Until the day no one fears him I will be among those who search for his shadow." I'm thinking of retiring and going back to the country. It probably has changed a lot, but it's the place where I was born. Once there, I want to think not only of Yuji but of what has become of us. Beneath the blue country sky. Winter, 2004 - the Present At this moment he can be anywhere. Directed by NOBUHIKO OBAYASHI
