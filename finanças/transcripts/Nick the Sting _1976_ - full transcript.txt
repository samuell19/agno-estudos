He called. The Friends of Nick Hezard Well? - Nothing special... someone was beaten to death at four in the morning. It must have been someone in transport. Go on. Eric singled out someone who might be useful for the insurance firm robbery. He says if you're okay with it, he can introduce you to him. What's his name? - Jack Duffield. What's he been doing up to now? - He's been working for Rahn. No... I need someone who shines. Someone who thinks is tough... they're the best. This one has already been arrested twice for pick pocketing. No. We don't know much about this guy. His name's Nick Hezard. What's he involved in? - He's a small time crook... pick pocketing, confidence scams. - For example? The usual tricks outside banks. - There are people still doing that? The world is full of pigs! No air today. There's one. I'm sorry to disturb you. - What is it? Could you change 100 Francs? - I'm sorry, I don't have any change. I'm so unlucky. I can't seem to change it today. Don't make me queue in the bank. Check it. I don't carry forged money... I assure you. - Let me have a look. You're so kind. - Here. Thank you. You're a sweet lady. I'd like to make a deposit. - Certainly, madam. Fill this in. - Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Strauss. - Change this cheque. Right away, Mr. Strauss. Any preferences for the cut? Double-breasted. - That's a good one! No, it was rubbish. - As you wish, Mr. Strauss. Ten 100's and twenty 50's. The ticket with your signature is in his inside pocket: ten 100's and twenty 50's. Let's get to work. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? - You're not a train. You stole my money. - What are you talking about? He bumped into me on purpose, to steal my money. Don't talk rubbish. It's not true. What's this then? That's my money. - After you stole it from me. Who wants to check it? Ten 100's and twenty 50's. I just took it out of the bank. - What a liar... it's got my name on it. Take a look. Can you read? I should give you a beating. - You're not hitting anyone, call the police. The police, okay? - Sure, I'll go to the cops... I'll call them now. Keep an eye on him. He's leaving with my money. - He's right! If you really want to call the cops, I'll accompany you... I'll go with him. You stay here, and don't move. Stay here and don't move. - I'll stay here and I won't move. Who does he work with now? - He always changes. He might be suitable. Get hold of him right away. As soon as he's done the job we'll buy him a nice wooden suit. Cigarette? - You've got all the bad habits. Right, but it's the only one that satisfies me. Drinking upsets my liver. Drugs are too expensive... and I've never met a woman who was on my level. Why don't you join the circus? You'll find women of your height there. Hezard, don't poke fun at my stature. Besides... I wasn't born a dwarf; it happened as I was growing up... it's an illness. I can always find a cure. Good luck. I have to use the toilet. Good day, madam. Safe journey, dwarf. - Wait. Wait. - What is it now? I've got to do a little something. - You do it as well? No, we pretend. The dwarf has fallen into the toilet! Pull him out, or it will block. Wise guy! Damn, it's heavy. This one is heavier. What have you got in here? - A dwarf. Don't joke around. - It's true; his name's Duvalier. Sister. What a stupid job! Wait, madam. Let me do it. Thank you. You're so kind. Take my advice, next time put your luggage in the baggage car... it's much safer. - It's true, I hadn't thought of it. So... my beautiful ladies. Do you like St. Moritz? Thief! Thief! Get him! Don't let him get away! Thief! I have to do everything myself... there isn't even a porter. What a stupid job! Hezard was right - I'm better off working for a circus. I'm coming. Nick. Can I come in? - I was just leaving. Without your knickers? Who were you sleeping with? My fianc?. Italian women... you always have to get engaged to do it for free. What a lovely puppet. Come here... I brought you some trousers. You can put the rest on outside. Who are you? - What do you care? I'm a formidable sheik. Congratulations... she'll explain everything tomorrow. It will all become clear. Are you an accountant? - Exactly, in advancement. Then come forward, my dear. Take your hat and your jacket... leave me the address of the tailor who made your underwear, they're splendid. Bye. Nick Hezard, you're as crazy as ever! You always act like the boss. What do you need this time? - Nothing... we almost got caught today. Duvalier and I were working together. I don't know if they got him. I thought it was safer to come here. Even the police have lucky days... they were everywhere today. I saw platoons going around. There was a big robbery today... didn't you read the paper? Look. Four million francs worth of jewellery. They opened the safe with a laser. You'd need a degree to operate it... it wasn't something you could do. You and I aren't worth two spits. Now I understand why I found this ring in my pocket... some son of a bitch wanted me to get caught with it. Give it back. You're always such a great pickpocket. Who would give you a gift like this to? The Empress of Persia? It's not a gift. They wanted to frame me. How much do you want to bet this was among the things stolen tonight? Of course. The police would find this on me... and I would go to prison, instead of the thieves. There's just one problem. They found someone smarter than them. First, they didn't catch me. And second... I'm keeping the ring. - Whatever... if you want to make love, take off your trousers. That guy you sent away wasn't all that, but you've given me the urge. It's great to see you. - Drop everything and come with me. Is Will next door? - Excuse me. He's at his usual table. How long has it been? For a moment I thought you came to see me. I'm here on business. Next time, I'll come for you... I promise. - Really? You look a little bigger, but in the right places. Eating or just beer? Two hamburgers and a beer. - I'll bring them immediately. So... have you heard about the diamond robbery? What do I care? I did it. With two friends. Don't talk rubbish! Even the dumbest person in here wouldn't believe you. And this... does this convince you? I would've bet on it. Sooner or later you'd rob a bank... someone like you couldn't keep on doing the small jobs. Listen, I can... go up to 600,00 Francs. 15% is all I'll get for it. Do you realise what I've brought you? - Jesus couldn't pay you more than that! I'm treating you like a brother. This will be hot for at least a year. The insurance company will pay 30% to recover it all... they'll save 2,500,000 Francs. - I'll be lucky to get 18%... and that's only because they know me. You might need me tomorrow. You go... they'll arrest you as soon as you open your mouth. Listen, Willy... you want me by the neck... We spent a lot of money for this job. Okay, I'll give you 15% if you give me 3%... cash in advance, tonight. I'll bring you the rest tomorrow. What happens if you disappear? - I told you, I need the cash tonight. I don't know... give me 1%. The ring covers that much. It covers it. Like I could sell it at that price... I can't. Here I am. - See? Every now and then I ask you for a different kind of meat. You sweet one you... - Go away. - I'm going, I 'm going. Well? Okay. 1% - 40,000 Francs. Cash. 10, 20, 30... and 40. It's me. Okay. Afence made contact with the insurance company two hours ago. His name's Will Latham. He's worked with Hezard before. What proof did he give them? - The ring. He promised to bring the rest tomorrow. I knew he was the right choice. The insurance company is now certain the robbery took place... they'll pay up and we still have the jewellery. Order wooden suits (coffins) for both of them. This whiskey is horrible. - Shall we go to bed, little guy? With someone like you? But I want to have fun tonight. Hey Nick, long time no see. I bet you're broke? - Yes, I haven't got a dime. Yes? I've got loads of cash. Yes? - I swindled Will Latham. I always said you could on anyone. What? And you can't? How many people have we conned? Don't you remember? You're right. You know what I say? You don't know? - No. We can con as many as we want, because the world is full of cash... full of it! You're right, let's leave this dive. Let's go. Look at the state of her. We'll find someone with the smoothest skin... and no hidden expenses. - Are you offering? No, she's paying. - In that case, I want two, three, four... Then let's go. I'd rather go right than left. Let's go straight ahead. One moment. The guest leaves first. Greetings, Ralf. Is the director general here? - They're waiting for you. Good morning, director. Did you read about the man who was killed last night: Will Latham? Yes, he was a well-known fence. He made contact with us, regarding the diamond robbery... four million francs, insured by Mr. Clarke with our company. Latham gave this to us. It's proof he was in contact with the men who carried out the robbery. We also have a lead... He was seen talking to someone the evening before... Latham gave him some money. We must get the jewellery back, but we're not paying... Four million Francs is a little too much to pay. What do you know about him? - Only his name... Nick Hezard. Don't worry about it, I'll get that delinquent. How much do you charge for an hour of love? 100,000 and a brioss! Bastard! Do I have to do it with you? Regina, you're always the most beautiful. - Yes... you always liked me. I'm always the most beautiful. - You're beautiful. Don't remind me, you make me think of when you were a child... you caused a lot of trouble. A real mess... Never. - Liar. Maurice! Look who's here. That bastard son of mine. Nick. - Yes. Hi, Maurice. - Let me blow my nose. What a pain. We haven't seen you for years, Nick. To what do we owe the honour? He misses his mother. Not exactly. I didn't come here just for you. - No? No. I came here to plan a swindle. Okay, okay... Who is it? - His name's Robert Clarke... he works in Zurich. Jesus, it's the American! Thanks. - So you know him. He's one of the worst. He's rich but... he might even have a clean face, but he controls half the illegal traffic. No, no... he's got too many men around him. Dangerous people, without scruples. Listen to me, Nick. No one can swindle him. But... I can. Is something wrong with your brain? You're not like your father. He was the king of swindles... Do you know what he used to say about you? Nick might just have it... but he'll never pull off the big jobs. He likes the women too much... he likes to enjoy himself. No, no, look... besides, it's been five years since your father died. We haven't done any since and we've no intention of doing any. Listen, Mum... that son of a bitch killed my friend. I fell for his trap but I realised too late... and you tell me to leave it? No. I've already decided. He's got to be made to cry blood... even if it's the last thing I do. It's been years since I've seen this lot all together. Let me introduce them. How's it going, guys? Rocky... Hi. Ray. - Hi. Antoine... - A pleasure. and Phil. - Hi. You don't know... each one of these men had the honour of having the front pages of the papers... dedicated to them. These are old memories. Water under the bridge... How long has it been since we all met? So, you're Marcel and Regina's son? - Yes. And you'd like to take your father's place. You used to sit on my knee. It was a long time ago... I remember you made a complete mess of my trousers. I don't do that anymore. It is true you want to do a swindle? - Yes. Have you already invented a new type of swindle? Not completely. Who do you want to do it to? Robert Clarke... Zurich. I don't like being late for dinner. Excuse me. It was a pleasure to see you again, kid. I've also got an appointment. Women... better not to keep them waiting. And you're meant to be the best in Switzerland... you're crapping your pants! I know the American better than you. I tell you, a man is just a man. He's a lot dumber than you think. We have to trick his brain, not his organisation... ours against his. Who cares how many people he has? I don't know if you're convinced, but I'm not... I don't have much time left to live. For this reason, I'll say goodbye... I'm sorry. Don't take it like this, Antoine. We can still work together. Good luck. Time to go upstairs. Come on... let's put some passion into it. Some people have to work for it. Well? Yes, yes... this swindle is making sense. It's convincing. - Convincing, eh? Do you think it will work? - Who knows? But if we do pull it off, we'll go down in history. It's going to be expensive. We'll need 200,000 francs just to start. Where the hell will we get it? - From the person who has it... the American. He's got to give us the money, in order for us to con him. Ah, yes, yes. But how? I was thinking of the cheque scam. We've got enough money to cover it. I assure you, it will be too late by the time he realises. No, no... you can't show your face around, otherwise it won't work. It has to be me, it's required later on. Come on, Nick. What if he sees you? Christ, Maurice... when you gamble in poker, there's always an element of luck... you can't do it all by yourself. How will you make him take it? Mum, you tell him. I have some girls who work for him... he spends a lot of money on whores. He uses them to find new girls. Nick will get close to one of them... and I'm sure things will happen. Yes, it's the best way. Didn't Marcel himself say Nick was good with the ladies? Don't give me the evil eye, or I'll leave. You've won everything for the last two hours, but this time I'll beat you. Everything on red. I'll curse you if it lands on black... I'm the one who is making you rich. All of you. This time it's going to come. I can feel it. Black. You dumb bastard... I haven't guessed one tonight. A gift. You've got an unlucky ass, little girl! Let me put out my cigarette. A whisky, double. My name is Benjamin Aickman. Not a great name, but it's not my fault. Can you... can you tell me your name? Is it the same for you if I say it's Chantal? I don't want a quarrel. - Pardon? Don't tell me you aren't in here looking for clients. I wasn't born yesterday. But that's not important. I love screwing whores... take me back to your place. Let's fuck, what do you say? Let's go. Hey, Chantal... pissing in a bathroom this elegant makes me feel in awe. If you were thinking about checking my wallet while I was on the toilet... and you were pretending to get undressed... then you've failed badly. Because... the person who robs from me hasn't been born yet. Start doing something to me. I pay people to work. Come on, get busy. You said you were here on business... is it big? I got hold of ten tonnes of iron from some fool who's selling it at half price. Who is this fool? Not me. You don't think I'm stupid enough to tell the first whore I meet. Do you already have a buyer? I don't know. Right now, I'm looking for a partner. I know someone in this line of work. He's a big shot. I sleep with a lot of people. He could be your partner. Well? He could be... he might, he might not. Depends on how he is. I'll introduce you... will you buy me a present if something comes of it? If you're not doing it for sympathy then it's a lot more serious. Okay, okay... don't get excited. If this works out... I'll put a ring on your finger that everyone will be jealous of. I give you the word of Benjamin Aickman. Well, Maurice? Have you decided? Go, go. I hear Franz Mann is making a profit of around 100 million Francs. He's a thorn in my side... he's a risk. - Mann is an evil beast. Let's burn a few of his trucks, just to test the water. Mr. Aickman is here. He's the business man Chantal mentioned. You take care of it. Get the name of the imbecile selling him iron at half price, then get rid of him. Goodbye. Good morning. You can go. Mr. Aickman, right? No, I'm his lawyer. I'll represent him during the first phase of the deal. Mr. Clarke, right? No... but I'm authorised to speak on his behalf. Afriend of mine suggested a business venture we may be interested in. You have the opportunity to buy iron at a very cheap price... I won't pretend to hide my curiosity. What kind? Same as what's on the market. They don't just give iron away. Try... if you can get it cheaper, I'll be your first client. Excuse me, where is it? Where is it? You're asking where it is? What world are you living in? You could double your money. You don't know? Who's telling you? That's confidential information... it's better I don't mention any names. Do you have faith in me? Trust me. No, I don't trust you! Where the hell is it? Harry, come here immediately. Wake up. You've upset me, my dear. How come you don't recognise the imbeciles, Chantal? I'm sorry, Robert. You're forgiven... buy yourself a present at least. I'm concluding the deal at seven. Listen, take him to Parker's jewellers. Make him spend at least 10,000 Francs. Call Parker's and tell them to sell him something worth 5,000 for 10,000. At least I'll get my money back. Send in Jean and Rolf. Immediately. Move it. The eternal father wants to see you. Let's go. And Nick Hezard? - We've found a lead. We're about to get him. Get it done as quickly as possible. - Sure. Well? - It worked. I'll have a coffee, please. Maybe it's just me getting old... I'm a little out of touch. Any more and I'd crap my pants. Did you open the account? - Yes, I did everything at the bank. I just hope those documents will fool the police. They'll hold up. For one night, they'll hold up. And now... go and see Chantal. - I'll get to her. Maurice... get back! Stop! Let's split up! There he is! Can you give me a ride? Who are you? - Police, hurry. You have to know how to lose. - Lose, my ass... It's the second time he's tried to kill me, and you want me to leave it? Everything stays as planned. As long as they're still shooting at me and not at Aickman, the plan goes ahead. I'm going to get Chantal. We proceed as agreed. Listen... do you know him? Have a good look. Never seen him. Don't mess me around or I'll break one of your arms! I know he frequents this shithole. How the hell should I know? Lots of people come here. I'm going to Chantal. I'm going to take a leak. Nick Hezard. - Nick, Nick... What a slap! You can't get away! Who could he be? Good evening. Did you see how much I spent on you? Are you satisfied? You like Aickman's gifts, right? It's so beautiful. No, I'm going to keep it. - No, I'll give it to you later. Let's go, sugar. Chauffer. We'll meet at the hotel. The ring? It's safe with me. May I assist you? Listen, handsome... I'd like to get rid of this. Give me 5,000 francs for it. What are you doing? It's not a fake. I bought it in Parker's for 20,000. Pardon? You paid 20,000 for it... in Parker's jewellery store and now you want to sell it to us for 5,000? I'm not sure what it is... but I don't like it anymore. Don't you think it's a bit tacky? Excuse me for a moment. - Yes, dear. Parker's Jewellers? - Yes, can I help? Listen, Mr. Parker, this is Stephen's Jewellers... there's a guy here who wants to sell me a ring for 5,000 francs. He says he bought it from you for 20,000 francs, five minutes ago... Did he pay you? - Sure, he paid... but with a cheque. Keep him busy, please. I'll call you back. Wait a moment. It's Parker... Chantal's man paid by cheque, but he can't check it because the banks are shut.. And now he's trying to sell it to Stephen's for 5,000 francs in cash. It's comical, trying to pass off a dud cheque on us... Call the police... and get the ring back. Our hands are clean this time. Keep him there and call the police. Amateurs! I didn't think they were so cheap. Did you pass by the bank this morning? - Yes. Was the cheque stolen or forged? - No, neither... it's all in order. - What do you mean? Yes, it was valid. - Why didn't you say? In order? - Yes. Hello, friend... you accused me of fraud, and you made me spend the night in a cell. Forgive me... you were trying to sell the ring so cheaply. The cheque... was it a forgery? No, no. Let me introduce my lawyer. I'm prepared to return the ring. The ring. - Yes. This shop... how much is it worth? They're accusing me of false testimony. They want 200,000 francs. For one night in jail! - He says he missed a golden opportunity. What fool would do business with him? - You. Me? - He said you were signing at seven... He lost out on the iron you were meant to buy. There's no proof. - But there is... he says he recorded the conversation, so the police know he was coming to you... to conclude the deal. Those bastards! They've landed us right in it... but this bragging will cost him blood. Prepare a cheque for 200,000 francs. Scum! I'll crush them! Give him this. It will pay for his funeral. I want to see this Aickman in person. Here is the cheque. In what name? My lawyer's name. - Which is? Nick Hezard. - Yes. With an 'H'. - Yes. You should dust this place some time. - Yes, yes. Clarke is here. - Disappear. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Robert Clarke. I'm Nick Hezard... and I've decided to crush you. You're young, but you are already fed up with life. See you around, friend. I'm sure you will. Now... the game has started. Hello? Mr. Rahn, it's for you. Hello? Thanks for the address. I'll go there immediately. You know I pay well for information, you won't regret it. Okay. Goodbye. Yes, who is it? - L have a telegram. I'm not wearing any clothes. Let me put my pyjamas on. I surrender. - You're doing the right thing... you made me lose a lot of time, but I've caught you, Nick Hezard. Who the hell are you? - I'm Rahn... I collect for the insurance companies. You've got a lot of jewellery for me... four million francs. - You've got the wrong person... I get 10% for everything I collect. I'll make sure you tell me where it is. Why have you got in for me? Clarke is taking you for a fool. Clarke, eh? Why Clarke? Clarke wants me in the shit. You're chasing an innocent man. Listen, you innocent angel... do you think I'm stupid? Nick Hezard, stop telling me lies. I've dealt with worse than you. Who do you think you are? You dirty son of a bitch! Son of a bitch. Don't say it, or I'll pull the trigger. One wrong move and I'll shoot. You've fallen badly, my friend. Nick, take his pistol. Already done, mum. Bastards! - You don't know when to quit. Bastard! Who the hell is he? He collects for the insurance company. I never thought we could fool them. - Sergio is downstairs in the car. You're worse than Cassius Clay. Let's go. I hope we don't get burgled. Will you pay for a new door? - Yes... you can even keep the fat guy. - L never told you... but he went to jail a few times for your father. I never knew. Did you really like my father? To be honest, I just like her. - Let's go. I'm going in front. Please, Regina. Just look at you... you're just like your father. Christ, he was handsome... Me too, I didn't joke around. Do you know how much we were in love? We spent the first night of our honeymoon in a taxi. We stole it in Paris. Gardignon; that was a great job. Don't tell me you made it all the way to Switzerland? Let's talk about us... is it all running smoothly? Did Maurice take everyone to the hotel? Yes, they're probably all there. It's not too late to stop... I don't like all this. There are too many people after you. But mum... what would my father say? I said it and I'll repeat it: The American has to cry tears of blood. Okay, he'll cry shit! You have my word. At last. Hi. - Come inside. Leave it, I'll close it. Good morning, everyone. Nice work, Hezard. Let me introduce my friends. They call him the hippo... because he gambles everything he earns on the horses. Perfect job, Hezard. I've heard of many swindles... but yours is unbeatable. You take after your father. Let's hope so. This is Claude. - Hi, Nick, it's a pleasure. Let me introduce Anna... the Einstein of pickpockets. She's going to work with us. If you need anything else, don't be afraid to ask. Always ready to sacrifice herself! How is it going so far? Very well. They're getting the building ready... so we can start. - Perfect. I can't wait. - There's one small complication... Nick is being followed by a gorilla from the insurance company. Damn it. That's all we need. It's not a complication. I'll get around them somehow. Whose is it? It's mine. - She's smarter than you. You're always on form. Eight cheques, each worth half a million. Try not to lose them. Anyone can cash them. It's one of the largest sums our company has ever paid out, Mr. Clarke. Believe me... four million francs is nothing to joke about. We'll deposit the cheques and return in two hours... tell the driver to wait for us. Look who it is. If I were you, I'd start crapping my pants. Stay still. - Help me, Hezard! Stupid fool! You're not getting off so lightly this time. You stay still as well. There's nowhere to run on a boat. You were working together. Come on, talk. He wanted me to steal his wallet. - What are you saying? And she's meant to be the Einstein of pickpockets? What a pair of scoundrels! Let the lady get in first. That was really close, I was expecting a real cop to show up at any time... we got lucky. - You were great, Anna. Not at all. I really enjoyed myself... I stole his button. - Great. Now, let's get Clarke. It's a shame we can't watch. Come on, let's go. Where the hell are you going? You must come and make a statement. - Out of the way, cop. We catch a gang of pickpockets and this is how you thank us? It's a great job being a policeman. I'm sorry to insist, but you must do it. I have to make a deposit. The banks are going to close... call my office, I'm Robert Clarke. Everyone in Zurich knows me. You might be famous in Zurich... but 10 kilometres away, no one will recognise you. Carl, call for back-up. - Right away, Commissioner. Okay, okay. You're not required. Okay, I'll be right back. Wait for me in the bank. They're arriving. Deal with the car. We only have a few minutes. Where are you? Maurice... they're about to arrive. Relax, everything is ready. Hurry up. - You disappear. Where have you taken me? - We've arrived. Anything that happens on the boats is dealt with in this police station. Follow me. This way. Where did they take the pickpockets? - The second floor. Got a cigarette? Yes. - The shops are closed. I'll have one as well. Need a light? Will you get a move on? It's him, I'm sure of it. - What does she want? Murderer! He killed her! I saw him! He killed her! Everything's going well. Catch this, Duvaliet. I'm really enjoying myself. I even spat in his face. Great shot. - Yes, he was right in front of me... and it just came to me. Christ, it really came to me! That son of a bitch thinks I'm being interrogated now. Happy, son? The swindle... has started well. Put this jacket on. - What jacket? I'm so happy, I could strip! Are you ready? - Sure, Maurice. It's your turn now. Okay, I know. - Remember, you're a judge. Make it worth something. Give him hell. - Don't worry... you gave me the easiest and most enjoyable role. Save me some coffee, Duvaliet. Go and do what you've got to do. I've had enough now. I want to know what the hell is going on? Were you here last night? What do you mean yesterday? - Yesterday night. I didn't leave Lugano yesterday. - Then how did the housekeeper see you? What damned housekeeper? - The housekeeper from Via Antilli. Via Antilli? Who? That crazy woman on the stairs? I don't even know where it is. Or if it exists, this Via Antilli. Do you know this woman? Her name's Chantal. What has she got to do with it? What has she done? - She was murdered in her apartment. I warn you, anything you say now can be used as evidence against you, Mr. Clarke. What are you doing? - I'm calling my lawyer. I know the law. - Lt's your right, go ahead. 77 64 82 I'm not involved in this. I'll be out in five minutes. You asked for Zurich. Speak, please. Hello? Marcier law office. Who is speaking, please? Mr. Clarke. I'm sorry but he's been taken ill... a perforated ulcer, yes. They had to operate immediately. We're all terribly upset. What? The police station in Cassis? What a terrible day it's been today. Why, certainly, Mr. Clarke... Naturally. I'll send someone immediately. Don't worry, Mr. Clarke. Naturally... the best lawyer in Switzerland. Good morning, Mr. Clarke... goodbye, Mr. Clarke. Robert Clarke's men showed up. He's paying ten times more than you. From now on, I work for them. However, if you raise your price, I could work for you as well. Hi, Rodman. Have a seat. How are you? Still with the police? Of course. I'm not a deserter, like you. You must be a sergeant now. - Sergeant Major. He used to be a cop as well... but he left us. He hated the stink in the station. How do you live? I'm recovering jewellery for an insurance company. Who are you chasing after? - Some guy called Nick Hezard. He was behind a robbery worth four million Francs, and I'll get 10% 10%? - 10% That should keep you going for a while, while us honest cops are dying of hunger. Beer. - Yes, a beer. Yes, yes. Beer. Listen carefully; help me get Nick Hezard and we can split 5% each. We'll need police help to find him. - This is corruption! Are you offering money to a cop? I want 6%. 6%? It's a deal. Be happy folks, it's going well. I bet he's starting to feeling squeezed now. Watch out, my friends. The hard part wasn't doing it... but getting him to believe. He has to be totally convinced... if we want to do what we've planned. Nick, I know what you're thinking... I was just a kid back then... I've changed. Okay. Who chose Rene? - Maurice, why? I know he used to be an informer. - Well? He was just a kid then. - He's okay. Very well. If Maurice chose him. Maurice, it's your turn. Stay still. You're making my hand shake. What a beard! Open the cell. I came especially, Mr. Clarke. - Finally, it's about time. Get me out of here. Yes, in good time Mr. Clarke, but I haven't prepared your defence... I know your reputation... you're a lawyer with balls. - Lt's a pleasure to hear you say it... but I would prefer it if you modified your language, Mr. Clarke. Tell me, did you kill her? No, I didn't kill anyone. That house keeper is crazy. You see, Mr. Clarke... to speed things up, I visited the murderscene... and carried out my own investigation. I'm not talking about the house keeper. I'm talking about the cheque. What cheque? What are you talking about? Mr. Clarke, no one knows better than me. You've underestimated the meticulousness of the Swiss population. It's quite clear, the judge thinks Hezard slept with Chantal... they've got witnesses, and together they blackmail Clarke. Clarke pays the first time, and the second time he kills. No one would dare to blackmail Clarke. And the cheque? What cheque? Lower your voice, Mr. Clarke. The one for 200,000 francs... Signed by you, to Mr. Hezard. We can't deny it, Mr. Clarke, when the judge has a copy in his hands. He's convinced this vulgar cheque, if you'll excuse the term... is what fucks you up. That son of a bitch, Hezard... he used Chantal to trick me. He set me up, I had to pay him. Ask Parker and the police... I can bring you a thousand witnesses. Excuse the term, Mr. Clarke... it's shit: the more you stir it, the more it stinks... I'll tell them, I'll tell them. They'll understand you wanted revenge... but for Christ's sake, why didn't you use your brain? You don't leave cheques lying around when you kill someone. I haven't killed anyone. - That's what you keep saying... unfortunately, there are witnesses who say they saw you... they say they saw the killer. The taxi driver who took you there is some youngster... If you don't feel like doing this I can speak to them, but.. If you insist you are innocent, I would suggest you go ahead. Well? - I didn't kill her. I'm sure you didn't. I'll tell them you'll be right out. It's him. Same face and the same grey suit. What? - Yes, I'm not mistaken, your honour. I saw that guy getting out of a yellow taxi... I had run out of matches and I was hoping that idiot would give me a light. I asked him: "Can you give me a light?" I looked at his face and thought: "My God, what a faggot." It's him. Same face and same suit, I'm certain. Your honour, come on... he's identifying him by his clothes. Who is to say my client wasn't wearing the same clothes as the culprit? Coincidence. Fortuitous coincidence. There are millions of suits which look the same... I ask that my client is allowed to wear different clothes. Look at the state of him! No, they're not the right clothes, but I recognise his ugly mug... it's him. - You dirty bastard son of a bitch! Why didn't you tell me the truth? You're in it up to your neck. Mr. Clarke isn't in any police station? No? Thanks, it must have been a joke. Search everywhere for Hezard. Ask the people on our payroll... pay them more if you have to. - Don't worry, they'll talk. We've arrived. Formidable... wonderful. I can already see everything in front of me... A camera shot will be made down from the ceiling. 500, 600,700 metres... wonderful! Excuse me, so... formidable, wonderful. I also need a ladder... Forgive my excitement and the disturbance and the disturbance I'm causing you, here is a small gift for their hospitality... So you really are making a film here. It's been a while since anyone filmed around these parts. Have you got permission from Chantal? Yes, of course. After all, you will profit, you will get a lot of money for it. It is an important production with great famous directors and actors... Who's in this film? Robert Clarke... and Marlon Brando as well. - Marlon Brando! You must carry out everything this woman says, you must follow her. This lady... - Sorry. We don't just need actresses, but also natural, real faces. No actresses. Excuse me... But I have to kiss Marlon Brando, I always play roles of a tsarina, Countess, I'm not a dirty... You have to organise everything, it has to be serious, registered at the police, everything neat, the machines, the recordings, you know? Hi, Nick. I thought you'd never call. You did the right thing... I was about to go to the cinema. Right. Listen, Nick, I'm going to get dressed. I'll have something ready for you. Please hurry. Bye. Out of here. Quick. I told you we'd meet again. I had no idea... You want to give her the cock, I give her the money, what shoud she choose? Beat him! Harder! Tell me where Robert is. How do I know? Where's Robert? Ask the police. The police? They don't have him... It was all staged. You've done something to him. I know you're good at conning people. You've set him up, how? Work it out, if you're so smart. You're going to take me to Clarke, or I'll kill you. Okay, okay. He's here... in Zurich. An apartment by the lake. Get your ass in the car and take us to him. You go first. Damned son of a bitch! You go that way. You'll have to be born again before you catch me. Bastard! Calm down. So, you're a tough guy? Take him away. I hope you're convinced now. Pull him back in. Try it again and I'll unload it in your mouth, so cut it out! Where's Clarke? Okay... he's in a place outside Zurich. This time it really is the truth. I know when I've lost. Watch out. Can I try something? Here's your sauerkraut and sausages. I knew it... you can drink all the beer you want, but you still taste of milk. Would you like to sleep with me tonight? - Lf only! As long as you've got your baby bird there won't be any problems. Can you get me some cigarettes? - Right away. Look who it is... Anna the Italian. There's no law which says I have to put up with you. Get off of that seat. Got something against policemen? - No... only the annoying ones. Nick Hezard used to come here a lot. My friend says he saw you together. - What is this? An interrogation? What the hell are you doing here? - There's a kid who wants to screw me... and I want to let him. We're just going through the motions... you know how it is. Or doesn't it interest you? I don't need these introductions, when are you coming to see me? Move your hand or I'll break this on your face! You might change your mind soon. Was he a cop? - Sergeant Major Roizman. He arrested me years ago. He's a son of a bitch... he promised me a lot of money for information and I spat in his face. The problem is that he found out Nick was at my place... let's hope he doesn't eat the leaf. (Italian expression) We're not going to end up in prison, are we? At least we'll get some rest. Beer. Listen... I don't want them to follow us and find out what we're doing... I'm going alone. Act normal and watch what they do. You can call me if anything happens. We'll go to bed another time. Kid... come here. Hurry up. Sit down. She left you... because you'll let her know what we're doing. It means they're working. What are they up to? Fool. Listen... if I can do something, I'd like to get her out of this... and tell you. If you pay me well enough. You have to leave me out of this when things go down. I've already worked with the police, you can trust me. What have they done to you? Look at what they did to you. They injured you. Why? Can you see it? Well? - We've cracked it, sir. Very good. - We've had some developments... we can recover all of the jewellery. I've been working with a policeman... he had half the police in Zurich chasing after Hezard. We discovered something more important... Clarke is involved. - Clarke? It's unbelievable. We have to give my friend a percentage; we needed police help to trace him. That won't be a problem. My dear Clarke. How are you? Your morale seems low. Are they treating you well? I'm putting an onion in your pocket. It's an old trick. Use it to cry in front of the video cameras when we're outside. Video cameras? They're taking you to the scene of the crime. Gentlemen, please stop. We're filming. Start the camera. This way, Clarke. No funny ideas. This way, please. Stop. It's good. My daughter's killer! She was so young! Calm down, madam. Don't spit. That beast killed her! My little girl! Finished. You can dismantle everything. Leave us alone. I have to talk with Mr. Clarke. So? Did you like the swindle? It was a great job... I've landed you in it right up to your neck. Now, they can smell you a mile away. Clarke... you're finished. Your head is in the noose. It took us a month to plan it. First we stole the 200,000 francs, and we used the money to buy witnesses. In the meantime, we killed Chantal. Sure, I'll get two years for blackmail and another year for attempted robbery. I'll be out in a few years, but you... you're looking at 30 years. Asshole! I'll kill you! Keep your voice down, fool! Do you want everyone to hear us? Do you want to get the cement out of your head? Try to understand, instead of screaming like an eagle. Why do you think we did all this? For fun? This is a passport... and this is a plane ticket to Venezuela. Go on, take them. Take them. - Why? Because you're going to take out the cheques from underneath your armpit. You'll give them to me, I'll cash them and in return we'll help you get out of here. It's all been arranged. You give them to me and you can go. It's simple, get on the first flight and you'll be fine. Sure... it won't be great living in Venezuela, but it's better than rotting in here... don't you think? Pull out the cheques. Now you've got to decide. You can't stop the clock, Clarke. It they transfer you to Zurich... you're screwed. Get him out of here! Come on, Clarke. Don't be an idiot... try to see sense. We can't meet each other again... if I leave, it's over for you. Will you tell me what the hell you're talking about? Are you insane? I have to give you four million francs? For what? For a promise? You don't have a choice. You have to trust me. I'm innocent... and I've got the proof. - Yes? Look in your jacket, imbecile. Inside, where you keep your wallet. There's a button missing. The woman took it on the boat. Do you remember? Right now, that button is in plain sight, in the hallway of Chantal's apartment. One word from me and the cleaner will say she saw it near the body... but didn't pay it any attention. As you can see, it's just one of the cards we have in our hands. Well? When will we take his jewellery? We'll let him escape in two hours, then... listen, did you get the servants out of Clarke's villa? I've already sent a telegram, telling them to go to his Rosanna residence... I signed it 'Clarke'. Great, now he'll find the house empty. He can take the jewellery... and he won't talk to anyone. We're so smart! Shouldn't we finish this now? - Right now? Why? Something might happen. No, it's all been planned. Very well. I understood perfectly, okay. In a couple of hours. How many cars will we need? Five cars and at least twenty agents. - Okay, let's go. One moment... let's not get fooled. We'll split up. You go to the fake police station, and I'll go to the airport. Everything's going according to plan. Get a move on. Listen, if they see you, raise your hands immediately... they shoot on sight. - Yes. The keys are under the seat. Move it. Idiot... that one! Hello, Robert. How did you get out of prison? - Prison? You mean the abandoned police station we rented for peanuts... By the way, I wanted to tell you Chantal is in perfect health... she's alive and kicking. What the hell are you saying? The police arrested me. You old fool, do you still believe in the devil at your age? You won't find a place to hide... you'll never escape. I'll have you killed like mangy dogs. Clarke... you tried to kill me and a friend of mine is dead... I vowed I'd make you lick the asphalt with your tongue... but this is just the start. I swear I'll crush you like a worm. Listen, Clarke... we might even be able to take your jewellery away from you. You're crazy. They'll fish your bodies out of the lake. How much do you want to bet you'll give me the jewellery? Everyone stay still. Otherwise, we'll open fire. We finally caught them. Give it here. Very good... but isn't this the famous jewellery they stole from you, Mr. Clarke? Insurance fraud. This stunt is going to cost you a few years in prison, and it's not over... because our investigation is starting to reveal your illicit trading activities. We'll talk about it at the station. Great people, conratulation. Great choice you made with Rene. Asshole! Let go of me! I'll kill you! Traitor! Spy! Let go of me! Let go of me! If you try it again, I'll beat you! Quick, he's escaped! Alert the station. He won't get far. Come on, get out. You're under arrest as well. Open up. There's no one here. Nice work. It worked right from the start: everyone thought you were a policeman. They actually kicked me out a month after him... we liked stealing too much. I had a world of fun. Where's the briefcase? I've got it. Here it is. What will Clarke do now? - Let him go to Venezuela. I didn't believe it was possible, but this time you carried out the perfect swindle. You've got a lot of faith in him. - With the cheque, it's eight million. Eight million! Eight Million, Eight!
