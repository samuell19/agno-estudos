PRESENT A MOVIE BY ALEJANDRO MONTIEL Yes? I'm Marcial. I come on behalf of Mufioz, for the nigh guard position. The lights are out all night. I'll give you the keys. There's one for the front door, for the gate and the biggest one is for the storehouse. Listen, if you hear any noise, it's the cats hunting rats. We don't feed the cats, and we don't kill them either. Is that clear? Do you like cats? No. Me neither. This one's for news. If anything happens, you put the time and date and you write it down here. If they bring something from the factory, whatever. No one comes at night, but just in case, you write it here. This one's for defense. If you have to open the door, take the stick. This way. This is the terrace. This door is locked all night. See that the lock is tight. Go around the place, take a look. Do you know how to write? Well, listen. Listen carefully. Write down anything that happens, write it in the notebook. Someone could snkea in through here. Pay attention. If you're scared, bring the stick, - Are you scared? - No. No? Well. Are you a relative of Mufioz? No. Okay- Look. We work on Christmas and New Year's Eve. There's no holiday for anyone here. You're going to leave me hanging, are you? Do you have a family? Kids? Something like that? No. No? Come here. This is the deposit. Once in a while, someone from maintenance'll take something. Write it down in the notebook. Okay? Careful, people steal here. I'll show you the toillet and I'm out of here. "1:00 AM: The guys downstairs are too loud, the dog won't stop barking. 3:00 AM: The dog is calmed, the guys left.“ Some rats showed up. The cats are useless.“ "The dog won't stop barking and the kids are back with the music. Hey, Peluche! How are you, friend? Everything all right? Do you know the guys? Hey, Colo. Go, Peluche! I already have. Did I say something? Everything's okay! Okay, okay. Calm down. I like this. I'm going to keep it. Call me tonight. You can't sleep! Try this. There you go. This is so cool. He's taking your girl. What? Do you like me, fag? Yes, honey, come here. Why did you come here for? Get out of here, come on, go, go. I'm going to kill you! Get out of here! Yes! Miguel? Come on, open up, I'm in a hurry. Can you open up? Where's Miguel? He doesn't work here any more. No one lets me know they're changing staff. Everything's the same here, they change stuff over night, and no one lets you know. It's so dark in here. Didn't Miguel leave a?ashlight? Yes. It doesn't have batteries. They're out of bleach. I don't know what they do with it, maybe they drink it. Aren't you going to write down what I'm taking? Ready. Here, give me that. Don't tell anyone I wrote this. No one trusts anybody here. There. What's your name? Marcial. What a weird name. And where are you from? May I help you? Yes. Did you spend Christmas here? Yes. Alone? Yes. Poor thing. Poor thing. What are you doing! You're out of your mind! You're out of your mind! SAY HELLO FOR ME. Happy New Year, cat. Let's go for a ride. Party, party! Yes! Let's go! Three, two, one! I'm going to kill you, you bastard. Victor Martinez? Bite me! Turco sends his regards. Damn it! What are you doing with that? You leave my tools lying around. You brat! I'm going to stay, you know? I'm going to wait for the doorbell to ring. Go. She's not coming back. She's mad. She's mad at me. She's not coming back. That noise! They're so noisy! They're going to wake everyone up. Damn it. Out. Damn you. I fell. It's okay. It's okay. Where were you? Water! Water! I'm thirsty, bring me water! Bring me water! Give me water, damn it! "10 pm. Rogelio took the truck to the factory-. He took the whole load." "2 am. The dog killed the puppies and I had to kill her. Hello? ? What happened? You didn't call me. I was busy. Did something happen? No. So? Then? It's done. Did you tell him I sent regards? What did that bastard say? I would have loved to be there. He said damn you. I think he's the damned one. He's such a bastard. He though he could mess with me. Now he won't be messing with anyone else. I'm losing you. When were you planning on calling me? When are you coming? I don't know, this week. Did you find anything in his house? Money? Drugs? No, he didn't have anything. That's not possible, he had to have something. Did you look carefully? There must be something, look better. I'm losing you. Let me go, man. Let me go, man, let me go. Leave the girl alone. When are you getting off? At six. I get off at five. You're so quiet. Okay- I'm off to the factory or I'll be late. Bye, Marcial. No, it's too cold. It's not cold. Stay still.

But if you'd like, I can stop by and bring you something to eat. Okay- I'd better go. Before dawn, I don't want my girl to wake up wiwhout me there. I left her alone, poor thing. But it's best, I really don't have good luck with men. I'm not talking about you, it's her dad, he's a mess. I can tell you're nice. Okay- I'd better go or I won't go at all. Victor? Why isn't he back yet? He should be here already. Is he never coming back? Where did he really go? Rosa! He went to the butcher's. Are you being nice to her? Don't make her mad.

Give the kid a cigarette. Thanks. It's a pity about the dog. Bye, kid. Be good. I told Malena about you. She's young, but she understands. She's fast, like me. No, that's not true, she's a saint. I told her I met you at work. They don't respect anyone, not even the people in the neighborhood. I'd better go, my baby is alone. - I'll go with you. - No, it's okay. If they see me with you it's worse. No, they know me, they are cool with me. If you'd like, we can see each other on Sunday. I'll cook sheperder's pie. Yes. But Malena is going to be with me. I can?t leave her on a Sunday. That's fine. Are you sure? I'm off. She's such a good cook. Rosa! Why isn't she coming? Tell her to come eat. Call her. There's someone coming on Sunday. Sunday? Rosa goes to mass on Sundays. I don't. I don't go. Those stupid priests can leave me alone. Let's leave seomthing for tonight. Very good. Very good. Stay still, stay still or I'll cut you.

Don't worry, Muriel, I lost interest in music. I have bigger plans than listening to a crazy old hag. They were a nice couple. Did she die a long time ago? Yes. When? You don't know when you mom died? Along time ago. It's so sweet of him to still wait for her. He's always waiting for her. He's so sweet. Your dad is so sweet. What does he have? He's insane. Don't say that. You're both very sweet, you too. So sweet, so quiet. I'm so lucky I found you. It's upside down. No, it's okay. Everything is upside down. What are you doing? No, that's not the piece, give it to me. - Nothing. - It's not right. MOml I don't want to play with you. What is it, Male? Come, morn! Why are you yelling like that, Male, what is it?
