RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Sorry, excuse me. Oh, my! Laurel, be careful. You'll spill your cocoa. Merry Christmas. Good morning. Welcome to The Plaza. Oh, here. Let me help you with that. Thanks. May I assist you with your baggage? I don't have any. I'm here to see Amanda Clark. Oh, well check at the concierge. I hope you made an appointment, she's a very busy lady this time of year. Actually, I'm going to be working here. Oh, really? Yeah. I'm doing research for the Plaza about... Christmas. Oh, you've heard? Yes, yes. We've been talking about it for weeks. We're all very excited about that. Good. Now, why don't you hold onto that? There may be more hot cocoa ahead. Thank you. I'm Jessica Cooper. I'm Reginald Brookwater. Head bellman, at your service. So, you're here to study our grand lady? The Plaza provided a grant to the university and I'm the archival historian in charge of the project. You have a very impressive title. I'm not as important as it sounds. I wouldn't be so sure of that. You know what we say around here. What do you say around here? Nothing unimportant ever happens at The Plaza. Hi, Dennis. Hi. It's all set. We fly to JFK on Christmas Eve. This is so exciting. I can't wait to meet your parents. I just hope they're not disappointed. Why would they be disappointed? Because their son is dating somebody who's using her PHD to study Christmas trees. How did your mom take the news that you won't be home for Christmas this year? Surprisingly well. She's going to go on that Caribbean cruise she always wanted to... Dennis, I'm going to have to call you back. Who leaves a ladder just standing around? I do. Oh no. Hang on. Good idea. I'm so sorry! I didn't know you were up there. Must've been an important phone call. I was talking to my boyfriend. Well, with boyfriends you get an automatic free pass. Just maybe watch where you're going next time, huh? Or maybe put up a sign next time. Like that one? Hey, Merry Christmas. One suit, sponged and pressed for Mr. George Kaplan. Room 796. Anything else? Of course, Mr. Kaplan. My pleasure. Good morning. How may I help you, theatre tickets? No, thank you. - Dinner reservations. - No. You need car service. Actually, I'm looking for... Here you are! And right on time, too. I like punctuality, it shows character. Good morning, Ms. Clark. - Amanda. - Amanda, thank you. And I see you've met Kenny, our head concierge. - Hi. - Hi. Anything you need, he's here to help. Isn't that right, Kenny? That's right, Amanda. ...Ms. Clark. This way. This is where I think we should place the installation. We are all very eager to see what you have in mind. Christmas traditions are very important to us here. And what better place to honour the legacy of Christmas at The Plaza than our historic Oak Room? About that. I was hoping you could give me some idea of what you're really looking for. I was thinking a sort of museum art gallery combination. You know, panels and pedestals, and of course, there will be an opening night party with champagne... That's not quite what I mean. When I'm developing an archival history presentation, I like to have some kind of point of view. You know, like a through line, or a... A Christmas story. Well, not exactly a... That sounds perfect. What does? We need a Christmas story. And since you're the expert, I'm going to let you come up with one. I'm not really a story person. I deal in facts. Facts. Yes. You see, the thing about history is you don't have to make anything up. The story's already happened. That just makes it easier, then. Yeah. Our records room is this way. All you have to do is go through the hotel files. There are plenty of references to Christmas parties and tree lighting, carol singing, special holiday events. Yes. Isn't it something? Most of these are pre-internet, so they haven't been scanned or digitally preserved. These are the original files. How far back does all of this date? I don't really know. But I don't think anything would've been thrown out, so could be over 100 years' worth. Well, I'll leave you to it. Which ones are the Christmas files? I have no idea. You mean they're not categorized? Well, no. That's why you're here. Miss Clark. - Amanda. - Amanda. Going through all these records could take a year at least. Well, you certainly don't have a year. Opening night of the display is planned for December 15th. But that's only three weeks away. I know. But fortunately, you won't have to do it all alone. You'll be coordinating with our Christmas decorator. Christmas decorator? There he is now. Mr. Perrelli, I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jessica Cooper. She's in charge of the History of Christmas at The Plaza display. Jessica Cooper, Nick Perrelli. Surprise. Surprise. You two know each other? - We've met. - We've met. Well, that's good. Because you'll be working together this Christmas. So what are you supposed to be looking for? Christmas. What kind of Christmas? Like celebrations, events, photographs. Anything that connects The Plaza to the holiday season. Why's that? To create a historic installation celebrating the legacy of Christmas at The Plaza. Like a museum. Yeah. Like a museum. You do that for a living? Yeah. I have degrees in anthropology, urban archaeology, and social genealogical studies. Better be careful, one more degree and you'll have a fever. I think that if people respect the past, it helps them understand the present. You know what they say about people who hang onto the past. They're afraid of the future. I don't think that's true. Can you not touch anything, please? Sorry. In historic terms, we call this an artifact. In New York terms, we call this a newspaper. Don't you have trees to put up? Well, I thought we were supposed to be working together. We are, and if I need you, I'll call. Okay. Enjoy your artifacts. Do you think I was rude to him? No. He sounds pushy, overbearing, and full of himself. Is he single? I don't know, why? Ask him if he likes almost famous musical theatre actors. I'm in the market for my next ex-boyfriend. Speaking of bad relationships, how's Dennis? Cass, don't start. Let's try here. You know I'm right. You've been dating for, how long? Two years next week. Exactly. And that finger is still bare. And I'm okay with that. Of course you are. Because you're afraid of commitment. You know, just 'cause you took one psychology course in school doesn't mean... Let's try over there. I've watched it happen. Every time a guy gets serious, you bail. That's why your relationship with Dennis has lasted this long. You're afraid of commitment, and he's afraid to commit. You gotta face it, Jess. You're stuck in a dead-end relationship. For your information, Dennis has made a commitment. He's taking me to meet his parents. In Florida. Really? We fly out on Christmas Eve. - Back there. - Yeah. - Who's idea was that? - What do you mean? - Well, to meet the parents? - I don't know. Well, who bought the tickets? Was it Dennis or the parents? What difference does it make? Maybe none, but if Dennis bought the tickets, it means that he's serious about a relationship. If his parents bought the tickets... Gotta go. I am filling in as one of Santa's elves in the park. And it takes me 20 minutes to get into those tights. - Thank you. - You're welcome. See you soon. Sorry. Sorry, I had to get the funding application in for next year. The university committee is being impossible, as usual. Is that hot cider? It was, 20 minutes ago. Don't forget, we have the faculty Christmas party a week Thursday. Franklin Collins is going to be there. He's the committee chair and I'm hoping to get a word with him. Who knew clinical biology could be so exciting? Who knew? How's your project going? I'm not sure yet. There's just so much material in the archives, I don't even know where to begin. And if by some miracle I did know where to begin, there's no way I'm going to finish by the deadline. I think taking this project might've been a big mistake. What do you have to do to get a drink around here? Dennis? Yeah? About the trip... To see your parents. Yeah? Nothing. Never mind. Miss Cooper. You need anything? No thank you, Reginald. Still trying to figure this all out. Christmas giving you some trouble, is it? There's just so much material here. - There is. - I don't know where to start. Well, maybe I can help you. Here. You want some history of Christmas at The Plaza? There you go. That was taken in 1968. That's you? Yes. It was the day after the Thanksgiving Day parade. We'd just come in for high tea. See, everybody dressed up in those days. Who were you with? This girl I used to know. Anyway, I remember she loved the Christmas tree topper that year. It was her favourite colour. It was bright blue, diamonds all around it. I promised her I'd get her her own someday. Did you? No. Life gets in the way sometimes, you know. But if you want to borrow that for your project... Actually, I don't think this is my project. I beg your pardon? Yeah, I don't think this is going to work out after all. I need to go talk to Amanda. You're not thinking of quitting, are you? It's probably for the best. Well, I hope you'll reconsider. Opportunities like this don't come along every day. Nobody regrets the ones they take, just the ones they don't. Anyway, I'm... I'm sure you'll make the right choice. Looks beautiful. Thanks. The plaza has so much great history, I figured it deserves the best, huh? See, you're not the only one who respects the past. Look, Nick. I'm sorry about what I said yesterday. I know you were just trying to help. Don't worry about it. So, you done for the day? Actually, I've decided to step away from the project. Seriously? I'm going to talk to the university about finding a replacement. That's too bad. I mean, I know Amanda will be really disappointed. I know. And I feel awful about it, but like you said, The Plaza deserves the best, and I just... I don't think I'm the right person for this project. I'm sorry to hear that. It was nice to meet you, Jessica Cooper. And you too, Nick Perrelli. Oh, hey. How about a souvenir? Think of it as an early Christmas present. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. I'm sorry, Miss Clark's in the middle of a very important call. Is there anything I can help you with? No, thank you. I need to speak with her myself. I'll wait. Beautiful, isn't it? I think this year's tree topper is my favourite. I mean, finial d'arbre. Miss Clark prefers we use the proper name. I'm supposed to bring it downstairs to the decorating team, but I kind of want to keep it myself. It is beautiful. You said "this year's?" Reginald showed me a photograph with a different tree topper. How many have there been? I guess as many as there've been Christmas trees at The Plaza. And they've had a Christmas tree here at the hotel ever since it opened in 1907. It's a tradition. I'll tell Miss Clark you're in. No, that's okay. Don't bother her. All right, well, do you want me to give her a message for you? Yes, please. Tell her... Tell her I've found our Christmas story. So, that's a dozen cherry tomatoes, three almonds, one bottle of champagne. Pink of course, Miss Thompson. Will there be anything else? My pleasure. Good morning, Miss Cooper. How can I help you today? And put one more in that corner over there. Needs a little Christmas. This is Nick. Nick. It's me. Alicia? Hi, how are you? I'm fine. Been a while. I know. Too long. Something I can do for ya? I heard you were decorating The Plaza. That's amazing, congratulations. Thanks. I would love to come and see it. Maybe we could grab a drink after. Hey, listen. I'm... I'm really busy right now. I gotta go. All right. Well, Merry Christmas. Yeah. Yeah, Merry Christmas. Hey! I thought you were leaving. I might've been a bit hasty. Well, that's great. It's... good. What changed your mind? Well, did you know The Plaza has had a different finial d'arbre every Christmas for over 100 years? Tree topper. I did not know that. Yeah. Each one is handmade and unique to that specific year. I did not know that either. This one, for example, is from 1949. See here, signed by the artist, making it a priceless piece of socio-historic memorabilia. Who knows how many more of them are hidden away inside these boxes? Yeah, who knows. Nick. This is a major find. Each of these tree toppers represents an artist with an individual story. The... the cultural importance of the passage of time represented by the artisanal craftsmanship in this room is simply staggering. They make really nice Christmas ornaments too. Are you just gonna stand there, or are you gonna help? What would you like me to do? So, why history? What do you mean? Well, you obviously love it, but where's the attraction? I think it's important to understand that the way politics and social mores have impacted events throughout time. Oh, come on, that sounds like a classroom lecture. What's the real reason? The real reason? Yeah. Please. My dad was in the diplomatic corps, so we moved around a lot when I was young. There was always a different town, a different school. I never knew where we were gonna be or what was gonna happen. That's pretty tough on a little kid. I started studying history. Felt safe. 'Cause you always knew exactly what was going to happen next? When you can't depend on the future, there's something kind of comforting about the past. You still feel that way? Sometimes. I took the liberty of bringing you some fresh coffee. You've been down here for hours. Thank you, Reginald. I guess we lost track of time. Well, the grand lady reveals her secrets slowly, doesn't she? By the way, I'm glad you changed your mind, and I believe the work you're doing here is very important. I mean, this place means a lot to me. To all of us. Thank you, Reginald. Hey, look at this. What is it? I found one. It's beautiful. That is magnificent, isn't it? Look at the fine work around the edges there. Takes years to learn that. That makes five we've found so far. And only 10,000 more boxes to go through. Well, good thing there are two of you. Good thing. Yeah, so I'm an elf! So what? It's New York. You look great. - Right? - Yeah. It's like stepping into a time machine in there. Every box I open is another piece of history. And Nick found some incredible photographs from 1922. Nick? Pushy overbearing Nick? It wasn't really his fault. I overreacted. He's actually a very nice guy. Really? And you two are working together? Alone. I know what you're thinking, and you can stop thinking it. There's nothing going on between Nick and me, except Christmas. Gotta go. Santa's finished feeding the reindeer, and he hates it when his elves are late. Sorry about lunch. I'll grab a candy cane at work. Hey. Did you ever find out if Nick was single? I don't care. Okay. I believe you. Do you believe you? Hi. Tell me you're not wearing that. Why not? You forgot. The faculty Christmas party. Of course I didn't forget. I was just getting ready. Come on in. I'll only be a minute. How's your project going? It's actually pretty exciting. I think I might have a mystery on my hands. Every year since 1907, the tree in the lobby of The Plaza has had a different finial d'arbre. A what? A tree topper. Interesting. That's not the interesting part. Look at the picture on the table. The top one. The Christmas tree? See? No tree topper. Fascinating. Isn't it? What happened to the tree topper, and why that year? I don't know. Jess, we're going to be late! Okay. I'm ready. Shoes. Right. Meet you in the car. There's Franklin Collins. Come on. Let's go say hello. Love to. Evening, Mr. Collins. Oh, Dennis. Well I'm glad you made it. This is Dennis Park, one of our newest faculty members. I read your paper, Dennis. It was interesting, very interesting. I'd like to talk to you some more about it. That would be great sir, thank you. This is my... Jessica Cooper. How do you do? Well, a pleasure to meet you, Jessica. You probably know most of the people here. I'm not... Well, Jessica's an alumni. Sociology and anthropology. What are you doing these days, dear? Jessica's working on a very important archival research project. On what subject? History of the finial d'arbres of The Plaza. Finial d'arbres... isn't that Christmas ornaments? That's right. How interesting. It's actually an important study from a cultural and historic point of view. Of course it is, dear. So, Dennis, tell me, what are your plans? Well, I have a little bit more work to do on this paper, but... Oh, no I think this draft that you delivered... Jessica. Did you have to bring up that whole... Christmas decorations thing? Why? It's just I'm trying to impress Collins, and it doesn't sound very academic. Well, they asked. Anyway, he wants to see the rest of my research, but he's totally behind my proposal. He actually told me he's going to personally resubmit it to the committee himself. Can you believe it? That's great, Dennis. Isn't it? Yeah. I mean... Good party, right? You having fun? Actually, I'm a little tired. It's been a long day and I'm... Of course. I'm sorry. You've been at work all day. I should've thought of that. You want to go home? - Would that be okay? - Absolutely. I'll call you a car. I would go with you, but really got to seal this deal with Collins. Of course. You don't mind, do you? Me? No. Not at all. Thanks for understanding. How was your night? I've had better. Do you like Christmas songs? I could play one for you if you like. Maybe it'll cheer you up. Thanks. Doing anything special for Christmas? I'm going to go meet my boyfriend's parents. Sounds serious. I'm not sure about that. Where is he right now? Back at that party. You know what? Maybe I'm overreacting. I mean, it's not like he made me walk home. True. What if Cassidy's right? About what? What if I really am afraid of commitment? I mean, this is my usual pattern. I fall for a guy, he gets serious, I get nervous, I break it off. Cassidy's your boyfriend? No, Dennis is my boyfriend. Who's Cassidy? She's an elf. You know what, I changed my mind, I don't want to go home right now. I don't blame you. So where to now? Happy holidays. Miss Cooper. Good evening. Everything all right? I guess so. You're working late. Oh, well. Sometimes I just like to stick around till everybody goes home at night or gets tucked into bed upstairs. And then I just listen for a while. To what? To the sound of the grand lady sleeping. She snores sometimes, you know. What are you doing here? I'm having some trouble with the lights. Seems okay to me. Yeah, well, it's my first time decorating The Plaza. It's kind of a game changer for my business, so I don't want okay, I want perfect. Well, I'd better make my rounds. Goodnight folks. Goodnight. What are you doing here? I want to find that missing tree topper, the one from 1969. There's... there's still a lot of boxes to go through down there. A little overdressed for the records room. I was at a Christmas party. Must've been a nice party. You look great. Thank you. So, how was the food? I always eat too much at those things. I didn't actually get any. You didn't get any? Why not? Bad timing. Well, if you're still hungry, I know a place that stays open late. I was going to go get something to eat. Want to grab some dinner? That's very nice of you, Nick, really. But, the thing is... I know, I know. You have a boyfriend. Still gotta eat. How do you feel about Italian? It was my Dad's business originally. Mostly party rentals. But when I took it over, I focused on Christmas 'cause that's where the real money is. But between you and me, I'd do it for free. You love it that much? Oh yeah, a house is like a blank canvas to me. And there's that moment when you gather the family out front, you flip the switch, and the whole thing lights up. And the look on their faces. That's Christmas. You decorate for your family too? It's a mob scene. I got three brothers and two sisters, and they're all married and they've all got kids. So, pressure's on. What about you? Anybody special? There was, a couple years ago. But it didn't work out. I'm sorry. Happens. So what's your boyfriend do? Dennis? He's in clinical research at the university. Impressive. He's a very intelligent man. You're no slouch yourself, with all those degrees at the end of your name. I don't know about that. You're kidding me, right? When I first started out at university, I had all these really lofty goals, you know? I wanted to use my education to speak to the human condition, help people understand history and make it relevant in their lives. Maybe make a difference in the world. And? And here I am, cataloguing Christmas ornaments. I'm sorry. That's... I didn't... I didn't mean it to come out like that. I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine. Don't worry about it. But you shouldn't be so hard on yourself, though. I know, I just always thought I'd be doing something more important with my life. I get that. But think about it this way. The storage room in the basement at The Plaza? Imagine how many Christmas memories are there, just tucked away in all those boxes. And you're part of that history now. And you're going to bring happiness to who knows how many people this Christmas. What's more important than that? This is me. Hey. Nice place. Thanks. My Mom and Dad were in real estate, so I got it when they retired. I see a big blank canvas. In case you haven't noticed, I've been a bit busy lately, so I'm sorry I haven't quite gotten around to decorating out here yet. Well. If you need some help, I got a guy. Does he have any references? Known him my whole life. I'll think about it. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. We've divided it into decades from the turn of the 20th century to now. Each section features photos of the ten tree toppers with stories about the artists, and we include a brief history of that decade's most important Christmas events at The Plaza. Wedding, party, celebrity guests. Jessica, I must tell you I'm impressed. Thank you. This is wonderful. It's the perfect balance of history and Christmas. Go back please. Of course. There, stop there. What's that? That's the one I couldn't find. There's no record of their having ever been a tree topper in 1969. That's impossible. It's a hotel tradition. That's what I thought, but... We can't have a gap in the hotel Christmas timeline. It makes us appear incompetent. I'm not sure what I can do about it. Well, something, I hope. This is your problem, Jessica. You need to fix it. So, why don't you just fake it? Go buy some other tree topper and paint it. Who's gonna know? I can't believe you're asking me that question. I'm gonna know! I'm a historian, Cassidy. I search for the truth. I'm not going to lie about something as important as Christmas. You know I'm not really an elf though, right? Sorry. I think Nick's starting to rub off on me. Nick again? Two cocoas please. He gave me a Christmas pep talk at dinner the other night. It helped a lot. How nice for you. Make mine a double. You know, this isn't fair. What do you mean? I mean I'm out here terminally single, and you've got two guys all to yourself. I don't have two guys, Cass. I have a boyfriend and I have a co-worker. So Nick's just your co-worker? That's all. And have you told your boyfriend about your co-worker? Well, no. It hasn't come up in the conversation. I bet. Honestly, Cassidy. The way your mind works. Do you want this receipt, or can I have it? My accountant says that I can deduct Christmas related beverages as research. What? Hi. Jessica, guess what. They approved my grant. That's wonderful news, Dennis. I'm so happy for... Listen, I got an important question I want to ask you. Okay. Not over the phone. Meet me at Crawfords, 6:00. All right. Great. See you then. I thought I might find you down here. You okay? Look at this. A receipt? In 1969, The Plaza tree didn't have a finial d'arbre. Really? Nobody seems to know why. North Pole Christmas Boutique, received from The Plaza hotel. Yeah. It's for the tree topper they ordered that year, but they didn't put it on the tree. Maybe they didn't get it. Or maybe it's still there. We're sorry the number you have reached... Number's out of service. Well, they used to be down in the East Village. We could go check it out, see if they're still in business. It's been so long, it's probably a waste of time. Well, you want to find that missing finial d'arbre, don't you? I gotta meet with some suppliers down there anyways. Come on. Finial d'arbre. Hey, what are you waiting for? Christmas? Look at this one. Look at the detail work. Must've taken them days to set this up. That is beautiful. Come on, let's take a picture. Give me your phone. No, it's okay. Oh, come on. Christmas only comes once a year. Thank you. Chestnuts. Come on. Don't you just love roasted chestnuts? Believe it or not, I've never had any. Seriously? I actually didn't think they were a real thing. I thought they were just from that song. Well, you are in for an authentic Christmas treat. Two please. Why did we park so far away? Did we? We've been walking for blocks. Well yeah, but then we got to see the skaters at 30 Rock, and the merry go round at Bryant Park, and the Christmas windows and the big Christmas tree. If I didn't know better, I'd say you did this on purpose. Hey. The store. Aha, The Plaza tree topper. It's part of my family history. Back when my grandpa used to own the business, we'd buy most of this stuff. But back in the day, I had an uncle who worked here, he used to design and build everything by hand. So this would've been a really important commission for him. Well, how so? Well, The Plaza would usually sell replicas of their annual tree topper in the gift shop. So that would've been a big boost for the family business. You said "would've been." What happened? Nobody really knows. Apparently, my uncle just lost interest and didn't finish it. Do you know why? No. He stopped designing and never made another Christmas decoration. He quit the whole family business. That's him. R. Brookwater. Yeah. That's my uncle. How long has he been gone? Gone? No, he's not gone. You mean your uncle's still alive? Yeah. I thought you knew. Uncle Reggie works at The Plaza. Reginald Brookwater? Right. He's the head bellman. Going down? We need to talk. So, how'd you find out? Your nephew told me. He showed me some of your other pieces. You're a wonderful artist. - What exactly are you looking for? - Your tree topper. The one you started to make in 1969. I was hoping maybe you still had it for my Christmas at The Plaza display. I'm afraid not. Well, could you draw one for me? I mean, based on your original design, of course. That was a long time ago. I left that life behind me. I understand that, but I really need it to complete the archive. Otherwise we're missing an important part of the history of... Miss Cooper, I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but I can't help you. Now, if you'll excuse me, we have a full hotel this week. So, what are you going to do? Well, I can't force the man to make me a Christmas ornament. I guess I'll just have to tell Amanda that we're missing one, and that's all there is to it. You think she's going to be okay with that? I doubt it. She doesn't strike me as somebody who sees failure as an option, but I just don't know what else to do. Well, why don't we drown your sorrows in a big plate of Linguini and clams? I can't. Come on. It doesn't have to be Linguini. No, I mean I have dinner plans with... Dennis. Got it. Yeah. He said he's got something very important to talk to me about. Well, don't want to get in the way of that. Nick. It's okay, don't worry about it. I'll see you later. Jessica. Any progress on our missing finial d'arbre? Actually Amanda, I'm not having much luck. I thought I'd located it, but I... Well, I have faith in you. I know you don't want to let me down. Or The Plaza. No, of course not. But there's not much... So I can safely assume that you will continue your search until you find it. Excuse me. 'Kay. No pushing, no shoving. 'Everybody gets a chance to see Santa. Okay, here you go. Hey! Okay, I'll be right back. Stay in line or you'll get on the naughty list. Just kidding. Hey! Hi. Thought I'd stop by for inspection on the way. It's new. Very nice. What's the occasion? Dinner with Dennis. He said he's got something important he wanted to talk to me about. What do you think it is? I don't know. Do you think he's going to ask you to marry him? Cassidy, that's the last thing I think he's going to do. No! It makes sense. Almost your two year dating anniversary, you're going to meet his parents. You think? I do. See what I did there? And if he does, I will officially take back every bad thing I've ever said about him. Aren't we kind of jumping to conclusions here? Maybe, but maybe not. Who knows. This might just be one of the best nights of your life. Here you are. Hi. How was your day? Actually, I'm having... That's great. Okay. So listen. I've been trying to figure out the right way to ask you this for a while now, so I'm just going to come right out and say it. Jessica... I trust you more than anyone I've ever known. I would like to ask you if you would work with me on my research project for next year. What? I told you I got the grant, so you could give up that Christmas project and we could work together instead. Wouldn't that be great? That's what you wanted to ask me? To write a paper with you? Well, yeah. What did you think? Something else. Like what? Something I thought I didn't want. Jessica, you're not really making any sense. No. I suppose I'm not. Excuse me. Where are you going? I think I need some fresh air. Hey. So, how was your dinner? I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Then we won't talk about it. Does your offer still stand? I mean, about the Linguini? I got a better idea. I know a place that serves up good old-fashioned Christmas spirit, and they're open all night. So, you want to talk about it yet? Not really, no. Okay. Well, if you change your mind... It was all my fault. I jumped to conclusions. I don't want to marry Dennis yet, anyway. You don't? No! How are you supposed to know if you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody after only two years? Well, I heard it's been done in only two weeks. And here we are. Nick, this is beautiful. This must've taken you days. Don't you ever get tired of Christmas decorating? Look up there. See, some jobs I do for money, and some jobs I do for love. See the white star? That's how you can tell I did this one for love. Almost forgot. I have an extra one you can use. What's this for? You're about to find out. Nicky, you're late! I know, Ma, Sorry, I was working. Hello! Hi. Ma, this is Jessica. Jessica, this is my mom. Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Perrelli. Call me Lana, everybody else does. You've got your sweaters on! Great. Well, come on in. We've got work to do. Oh, thanks. What is all this? It's just a little something my family puts together every year. We do our Christmas shopping early and wrap all the presents to give to a couple of local charities so everybody gets a Christmas. That's... Really nice. Everybody. Hey! Everybody. Look who finally showed up. Nicky! Hi. And this is Jessica. Jessica, this is everybody. Hi Jessica. Hi. Okay, you get to work. Jessica, come with me. Have fun. Welcome to cookie command centre. We wrap all these up and take them over to the veteran's home on Clark Street. You do this every year? It's no big deal. We have so much, it seems like the right thing to do. So, how do you and my Nicky know each other? We've been kind of working together at The Plaza. Only work? We're just friends. Well, you must be a pretty special friend. My son hasn't brought anybody home for Christmas in years. Not since he and Alicia... Well. In years. It's okay. He told me about her. Did he tell you she broke his heart? How's it going in here? Well, don't expect any miracles. I haven't made cookies since I was a kid. They say it's like riding a bike. You never really forget how. Okay everybody, it's showtime. Yes! Dad, do we have to? Oh, come on, Nicky. You know it's a family tradition. Let's go. Come on, let's do this. I'm sorry about this. What's a tradition? Thank you, thank you. And now you know why I married him. Okay. Our final singer in this year's Christmas karaoke will be... Jessica. No, I can't, really. I'm not good at this sort of thing. Nicky, why don't you help her? All right, all right. Gosh. You did that on purpose. I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about. You rigged the votes so Jessica and I'd have to sing together. Oh, Nicky. What a terrible thing to accuse your mother of doing. Shame on you. Okay. 'Night mom. Thank you. I had such fun tonight. I hope we'll see you again during the holidays. But I imagine you have plans. Actually, I do. You don't seem very happy about it. You know what, Lana? I'm not. Well, Christmas isn't just about cookies and singalongs. It's also about reflecting on the past year. Where we are, where we're going. Maybe this is that kind of Christmas for you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Sorry about that. My family gets a little crazy sometimes. Are you kidding? I loved them. My mom really liked you too. I could tell. She made me feel pretty special. She said you haven't brought anybody home for Christmas in a long time. Let me guess. She mentioned Alicia? Just once. My mom talks too much sometimes. Alicia and I were engaged until she decided there was no real future with a guy who decorates Christmas trees. I'm sorry. It's all right. I should be grateful, I guess. That's a very healthy attitude. Well, she dumped me at Christmas. So every year instead of thinking about it, I decorated. Nothing like a heartbreak to really help your business take off. What is it? Looks like we gotta take a detour. How about now? Still off. I don't get it. Fuses are all working, the bulbs are all fine. Wait a sec. Primary connective conductor system isn't achieving maximum wattage polarity due to an oxygen breach. I'm sorry? Somebody pulled out the plug. It's beautiful, Nick. Thanks. You know this place used to be a nightclub? Really? It's called the Persian Room. It's one of the most elegant places in the city. Sinatra used to sing here. Who? You're kidding, right? A little. And this place right here, this used to be the dance floor. My grandparents met here. Really? It was Christmas Eve, she was a nurse and he was away on shore leave, and he asked her to dance. Like this. And they danced together all night, and when the sun came up, they made a promise to each other that when he got back from the war, they would never be apart again. And they kept that promise the rest of their lives. And so I come here every year on Christmas Eve, and I have a glass of champagne in their honour. That's a very special Christmas tradition. Look, I... I know you don't like to think about the future, but what are you doing on Christmas Eve? Nick. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I thought... You're a wonderful person really, but I... I can't do this. I'm sorry, I have to go. Sorry. We're closed. Uncle Reggie! What are you doing here? I came to find something. You've done some nice work here, Jeremy. Thanks, Uncle Reggie. I mean, the place looks pretty good. I'm glad you like it. Look! Look at that, my old workbench is still here. Yeah, Dad liked it. Said it reminded him of you. It's our internet order desk now. Well, that is something. Could you give me a hand? Yeah, this, put it above. Okay. Whoo. What are we doing? I'm opening a doorway to the past. A doorway to the past? Yes. The past... shall set us free. What's in there? Well, I told you I had to pick something up here. Yes. Here we go. What is that? This is a little bit of unfinished business. How long has that been in there? Close to 50 years. Do me a... a favour, put on a big pot of hot coffee and crank up some Christmas music and leave me be for a couple hours. Okay. I got some work to do. And alternate the larger and smaller panels along the outside so it creates a flow through. Don't forget to leave some room for a couple trees. - Hi. - Hi. I wasn't sure you'd be here. Well, we're a team, right? At least I thought so. Nick... Just let me finish. About the other night, I didn't mean for that to happen. That's not true, I meant for that to happen, but I was out of line and I'm sorry. No, Nick. I'm sorry too. Look. I'd be lying if I said I didn't care about you, I do. But Dennis and I have been together almost two years. I'm going to go to Florida to meet his parents. Sounds... Fun. The thing is, I'm in a relationship and I can't let my feelings for you get in the way. Mine either, huh? Nick, don't say that. I'm sorry, I just... I promised myself I wouldn't be a sore loser, and I guess that's a little easier said than done. I should get back to work. Wait. I still have your Christmas sweater. You better keep it. I heard it gets cold in Florida at night. Dennis. My parents have arranged a car to pick us up at the Miami airport. And then we'll meet them for dinner at this... Sorry. That's okay. Dennis, you said you had something you wanted to talk about? Right. The thing is, I was thinking about the other night. What about it? I was thinking about... Why you left. If you don't want to write the paper with me, I understand. It's not about the paper. It's not? Who bought the tickets? What do you mean? For our trip to Florida, who bought the plane tickets? My parents. It's only fair. It was their idea. Why? Dennis. You're a very nice guy. You're smart and I know you mean well, but I... I need more than that. What kind of more? We've been together two years. Almost two years. Right. Almost two years, and I thought I didn't want a commitment, because that meant thinking about the future and that was scary. But I've seen what the future can look like, and I'm not scared anymore. Are you talking about... marriage? I don't know exactly what I'm talking about, Dennis. But whatever it is, I know it's not this. Wait... Are you breaking up with me? I'm not sure there was anything to break up. Are you sure about this? I am. I'm... I'm sorry, I... I guess I always knew this was going to happen, I just, I didn't want to admit it. Take care of yourself, Dennis. You too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh, Miss Cooper! I have a package for you. It was left here sometime last night with your name on it. I didn't see a card or anything. I know who sent it. Thank you. I thought maybe you'd like it. But you said... I did. I stopped making things like that a long time ago. You never said why you quit. Love. It was 1969. Her name was Marie, and I was going to marry her. And I was making the tree topper that year in her honour and I was going to propose to her on Christmas Eve, but her... her parents, they didn't approve of us. Or me, actually. They thought of me as someone who made Christmas decorations. What kind of life could I provide for their daughter, and so they made us stop seeing each other. Every time I... I looked at that thing, it reminded me of her, and I couldn't throw it away. So I hid it and tried to forget about it like it never even existed at all. And you never made anything again? Well, my heart wasn't in it anymore, you know. I made things with love, I guess. And I guess I just stopped believing in that. So why are you giving this to me? Working at The Plaza all these years, I've seen honeymooners and newlyweds and proposals and weddings, and then watching this Christmas you and Nick together, I thought maybe one shouldn't give up on love. How can we be in love? Nick and I barely know each other. We just met. Yes, but you met him at this hotel. And you know what we say around here. Nothing unimportant ever happens at The Plaza. And run another string of lights through there. I want the place to sparkle. Nick. Alicia? What are you doing here? When I heard your voice the other day it brought back so many memories, so I thought I'd come and say hi. Well, hi. How are you doing? Exhausted. I just finished a really intense spin class. You've done a great job here, Nick. It's beautiful. Thanks. It's going to open up so many possibilities for you. I hope so. I have always been very proud of you, you know? I've missed you, Nick. I miss us. Hey, what, what are you doing? What does it look like? Alicia, we've been over for a long time. I know, but that's in the past. I know. I'm sorry, but I think that's where it should stay. Look, you know what, I gotta get back to work. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. The Plaza has many stories to tell, especially around the holidays. And this year, with this wonderful History of Christmas display, we hope to share some of them with all of you. Please welcome the very talented historian who put all of this together for us, Jessica Cooper. Thank you so much. Such an honour to have been entrusted with the legacy of The Plaza hotel. But I also want to acknowledge another very important part of that legacy, my wonderful friend Reginald Brookwater, who generously brought us a long lost piece of history from a Christmas past. Thank you. Christmas is... Christmas is a time for celebration. But also maybe a time for reflection, too. Not just the history of all of this, but the history of all of us. These beautiful decorations are an important part of the holidays, but I don't think it's the decorations that make Christmas memories. It's the decorating. It's the coming together to put up a tree, hang some lights, make cookies, even sing Christmas songs, sometimes badly. I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's not just what we do that makes the holiday special, it's... it's what we are to each other. And it's what's in our hearts that makes us all a part of the history of Christmas. Thank you. Oh, Miss Cooper. Thank you. No, don't thank me. Thank you. Thank you for giving me back my art. I called my nephew this morning and I'm going to start making Christmas decorations again. That's the best gift you could've given me. Great speech, kiddo. Thank you. Excuse me. Reggie. Marie. I was hoping to find you. What are you doing here?! How did you... I read in the paper that they were having a party about the history of Christmas tree toppers and I thought I'd take a chance. I hoped you'd be here. Was that going to be mine? Yeah. It's beautiful. It sure is. That was a nice speech. Thank you. I'm glad you could make it. I wouldn't miss it for the world. You're alone? Yeah. I thought maybe you'd bring your friend. Who? Come on, Nick, you know who. What are you talking about? I saw you kiss her the other day, right in that room. You saw... you saw that? No, no, no, no. It's okay, it's no big deal. No, no, really. It's no big deal... That was Alicia. That was my ex. She heard I was here, and she was trying to... Look, I told her I wasn't interested, and she left. Jess, I thought you understood how I felt about you. I'm sorry. No, no, no. I should be the one apologizing. You have a boyfriend. Actually, I don't. What about Dennis? Dennis and I just came to the end of our relationship. That's not 'cause of me, I hope. No. Because of me. Congratulations! Thanks. Look, it's, it's Christmas. It's an emotional season for a lot of people and we just met. Maybe we should take a step back and, you know, take a breath, get some perspective. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, let's... let's do that. Let's. I better go. My reindeer's double parked. Merry Christmas, Jessica. Jessica. You've done a remarkable job. Everyone is having such a wonderful time. Almost everyone. And what are you doing for the holiday? Actually, I've had a sudden change of plans. My mom's still on her cruise, so I'm... I'm going to go skiing with my friend and her family for Christmas. Well, I hope you have a nice time. I prefer my ice in a Martini glass. I wish you would reconsider our offer. The Plaza could use a permanent historian. Thank you, I appreciate that. But I... I'm going to put my degrees to use in another way. I'm taking a teaching position at a school down in the village. Investing in the future. Well done. This is for you, from all of us. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Kenny. Merry Christmas. I'm sad to see her go, Ms. Clark. It's Christmas, Kenny. You may call me Amanda. Thank you, Amanda. I'll go back to work now, Ms. Clark. Hi. Hey! I'm almost ready. I appreciate this so much, Cass. You're sure I'm not imposing? With my family? Forget about it. The more the merrier. Okay. Besides, I can't have my bestie spending Christmas alone. Any word from Nick? No, nothing. I guess stepping back a bit meant saying goodbye. Well, you're better off without him. Besides, it's obvious that you can decorate a house on your own. The outside, it looks great. I mean, it's a little over the top, but I'm an elf, what do I know? I didn't decorate the outside. What? If you didn't do this, then who did? Is this a private tradition, or can anybody join? Please. Tell me, how did you get all those lights on my house without me knowing about it? You kidding me? I decorated The Plaza hotel this year. House is a piece of cake. Show me again where your grandparents danced. So does this mean you're free for Christmas? What do you have in mind? House full of family. There's going to be presents, and food, and a lot of noise though, so you've got to be really into Christmas to enjoy it. I could give it a try. And if it doesn't work out? We should think of the future. There's always next Christmas. And the Christmas after that. And the Christmas after that. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
