In there? Uh, huh. The wolf snatched Birte and dragged her into the cave! I don't wanna go in there. - Please, you've got to get her out! Birte? I've got her! Run, Ylvi, run! Hide! - I don't know where! Wickie And The Muscle Men Faster, men! I'm faster than you. Wait for me. All men on the roof! They're back! - Yeah! We write in the year of our Lord 1095. In the far north live the Vikings. Their courage is respected. Their raiding parties are feared. They rob and plunder day and night, even on Sundays and holidays. When they return from their sea voyages the women and children of Flake rejoice over the rich booty which their men bring back home. My name is Ramon Martinez Congaz from the Royal Spanish Dispatch Department. And this is my story. Here, Faxe! For you. But no more all at once, OK? Can't wait to see what I get this time! - With luck a good box on the ear. Shut up, shrimp! - Thank you! We should do it again soon! How'd ya like an oar down your throat? Like to see you try! - Tiny Horns! Yourself! - Yourself! Ulme, when we torch a village more support from the read guard, OK? Thanks for the tip, Chief. - Gorm. Just wait! - I'm so happy! Snorre? Tjure? - Father! Father! Wickie! - That was my split! Mine too! Father! Wickie! - There's your split! There you are, my boy. Come here! - Welcome home, Father! We missed you so much! - That's good! Where's your mother? In the kitchen! - That's even better! Did you bring me something? Of course! Look! I plundered it all for us! Pure gold and silver. I can't figure out what this thing is, but it's great for scratching your head. And that is salt! A whole sack full! - That's all fine and dandy, but you shouldn't always bring the boy so much ice, Halvar! Oh, come on, kids love ice, right? - Thanks, Father. For you, wife, of course I also have a gift! I can hardly wait to see you in them! - Ouch, that's hot! I think so too. - And what an aroma. Smell it. Boy, we have to talk man to man. - Will you tell me about the last expedition? No, it's about something else. You're now approaching an age, when... Well, there are girls. And boys. And there's a difference. When you go with a girl into the woods, it can happen that... Halvar? - Leave me alone! It can happen that suddenly a wolf pops up! Then it's completely normal that the girl runs away. Girls can do that. Not boys! - Don't listen to him, Wickie! Woman, keep out of this! This is men's business! The washing women are snickering because my son ran away from a wolf! Ah... It's deja-vu! - What's that? French. He's making me the laughing stock of the village. - Our Wickie is a clever boy! Feed me! Feed me! - Wickie! Birte! He's a cowardly little brat! - But, but I only thought... That's your problem! You think too much. Vikings need this and not that! - I find that extremely intelligent on his part. Eat something, sweetie. Thanks, mother. What a boy I was at his age! All the way to Lapland they marveled at me. I knew where the wolves were hiding. I lay in ambush so that none escaped! I never ran away from a wolf. They had only to see me from afar to turn heels and run! - We had a peeper! - Serve him right to lose an eye! - Such a one was I! I couldn't be stopped! I showed no mercy. Always in pursuit! I wasn't a weakling like my son! I drove them through the forest! The fiercest of all I caught in a trap I built myself! Therefore, rule number 1: You have a head so you can go through a wall with it! Mark that well, my son! - That's some amazing salt you plundered! For Mother, only the best! - It's sand! What? - They cheated Halvar with sand! What are you laughing at? - That wouldn't have happened to our Wickie, who is much slyer than you! Muscles aren't everything! That did it! A duel will show whether brains or muscles are stronger! A what? A real duel between men! What do you say, son? No chickening out! OK--but no boxing or stuff like that! No, much better. In accordance with an old Viking tradition we're going to have a stone duel. The rules are very simple. Get the stones over the brook, over to the goal flags! Whoever gets his pile of stones over first is the winner. That's easy. - Don't count your chickens before they hatch. You may not be helped by any other Viking. Understood? Yeah, I'm not stupid. - If I win can I get a real Viking helmet? - Little knee-high wants his own helmet! I want to be a real Viking. You have to start early. Did you hear that? - He wants a helmet! If you win today, my boy, then you'll get more helmets than I have kooties in my beard! - How could he carry so many? Agreed? We are agreed, the bet is on And welshers will be spat upon. Get ready, men. On your mark, get set... How's it goin', Wickie? Not enough brains, huh? Go, Wickie! show them! - Hey, Wickie, We could have a flower picking contest! You'd win hands down! Hm... Hm... I've got it! What's he doing now? - He's messed in his pants! The kid is really clever. - What? Just think about it. With what? Typical. He can play with Gessi the ox, but he sure can't do any work. Whatever. All the same to me. Wickie, Wickie, Wickie... Oh. That is my son! Wickie. Wickie, Wickie... Quiet! I won! Or is anyone here of a different opinion? Who else? My stones got there first. - You had help! From him! That was against the rules! - Our ox is no Viking! Is so! He has horns! So he's a real Viking, just like me! You're an ox, all right. OK, give Wickie his helmet. You promised him! I'll never be a real Viking. - I'm entirely certain that you will! - I dunno. Father always says a Viking has to be strong and brave. I don't understand why Vikings have to run around shouting so much. If you want to rob foreigners you could at least ask them first. - We can't ask foreigners. We don't know any foreign languages. - Bulli and Balli understand me. And they're seals! Sometimes I think they're the only ones who understand me. But I understand you too. You have to hold fast to your dreams, then they come true. I have a dream too. - Really? What is it? I'd like to fly, just like those sea gulls! That'd be cool. If I only knew how they do it. If they can do it, with their little brains, it can't be all that hard. Wait a minute! - Where're you going now? I've gotta try something out! - But the village festival is about to begin! Do you wanna fly, or not? - He is so sweet. Tjure! - Here. We interrupt this brawl for a brief announcement. We drink to our dear Chief, to Halvar of Flake, who has made all of this possible! It isn't easy to steal everything from fierce foreigners, to snuff out the existence of peace loving people and destroy everything they hold sacred. But he's managed. I'm so happy! - Men... and ladies, that was the most successful raid of all time! The grain alone will last the rest of our lives! I haven't got that much more left. - Ramon Martinez Congaz, from the Royal Spanish Dispatch Service. You said you have never been so successful. By what percentage have your profits accrued during the last fiscal quarter? What did he say? - Good. I'll write down 95 percent. Yes! Where's Wickie gone to? I made him a special kiddie platter. He's probably moping around someplace. - Yeah. Why couldn't my boy be like them? - Because he's got something upstairs! Ha, Wickie's stood you up? He's playing our song. Oh, shit! Ylvi? - Thanks, Wickie. I've always wanted one! Why weren't you at the party? I worked through the whole night. Come, I want to show you something! Can you really fly with that? - I don't know if it works or not. So I wanted to try it out before I embarrass myself in front of everybody. Just make sure you don't let go! - Got it. Just a sec! I made this for you. - Oh, a Viking needs a sword! Wow. Thanks, Ylvi. It's unbelievably practical! You're welcome. Hold tight! Oh, my! Faster, Wickie Look out, log! -What? Jump over the log! Ah! Wow, wow, wow. Wow. Yes, ha, ha, ha! - Hey, you're flying! Don't let go! - Oh! Sorry! Boy, would Father be surprised! How far can you see? - To the village square. To the fire reef. Wow! From up here you can just about see everything. What's wrong, Wickie? - A ship's approaching! And it doesn't look friendly! - Is that a joke? No! We gotta get to the watch tower and warn the village. - OK! Wait, Ylvi, come back! Hey, wake up! We're being attacked! Ylvi! Hurry! We're under attack! - I drank the whole night through! Ma...Ma... Ma... Ma... Ma...Masks on! Ah! The Vikings were taken by surprise. They had partied through the entire night, thanks to which their defenses were reduced by 95 percent. Wickie had stupidly gotten himself caught in a tree with his kite. He had to watch helplessly as his village Flake was overrun. Halvar and his men fought on bravely far into the night. They could not prevent the disaster. The foreign horde had stolen from the Vikings what they loved the most. The children! - The barbarians! Barbarians don't act like that. - They must have been demons! Yes! they had a gruesome ship! - And weird faces. Worse than Snorre's! - Come on, demons! Cut out the nonsense! - No, they might be right. There is a terrifying legend about the ghost ship with the black sail. It rose long ago out of the great waterfall at the edge of the world. It wandered over the sea, always in search of innocent children to sacrifice to the fire giants. Only sometimes one might escape to fly as a soulless ghost back to its village! I can fly! - A ghost child! Wickie! - Thanks be to Odin, you're here! We were so worried. - Is it really him? I can recognize my own son! - Bravo, Chief. But you gave up on him! I really flew, Mother. And then I saw the ship coming. I wanted to warn you. - We're really happy that you're back, my son. But a Viking always tells the truth. So if you hid in a tree like a coward, at least own up. I want my children back! - I miss my son! Too bad they didn't take my old lady with them! And how about Ylvi? - The same thing happened to her as t the other children. - What? It's good that nothing happened to you! It's my fault. I sent her to the watch tower. Quiet! Quiet! We're getting nowhere, people. - What do we do now, Chief? Men of Flake! We're going to give those mangy demons a good kick in the ass! Early tomorrow we go to sea! Don't be sad, my little sea horse. I'll be back soon. You have to be strong. Just like on our wedding day when you carried me over the threshold. -Come on, are you crying? And he didn't even want to say goodbye? - You really upset him. He's a very sensitive boy. Just take him the way he is. I would have liked him to have a bit more gumption. Come here, sourpuss. - Believe me, it'll be OK. And if it's the last thing I do, I'll bring our child back home! But we don't have any children. - Then I'll get you one! What color do you want? - Away, men! To the oars! What are you doing, men? You can't all sit in the bow! Keep it up! Wickie? Sweetie, you have to eat something. Wickie! Pst! What are you doing there? - I said, hands off the breakfast barrel! Ow. Ah! Shit! - What was that? A fish! I don't believe it! The brat snuck on board! And you helped him! I only lifted up the lid. - You shouldn't have! But I only wanted to rescue Ylvi! - A ship is no kiddie playground! I'm not happy! - You think I am? - Ship in sight! Oh, great! - What's wrong? It's Sven. Sven the Shriekable? - And he didn't get the name for nothing. The rascals. They're right nasty. - Will they attack us? They didn't come to bake cookies. - Why don't we surrender? We don't have anything to steal! - Even so, our reputation would be ruined. So row, men! Lean into it! - You're rowing in the wrong direction! I have to get back home. I forgot my sword! They outnumber us! - Yeah, but I only see 2 ships. He usually has 3. Could be a trap! Gorm, do you see a third ship? - No, Chief, but up ahead there's nothing but pea soup! - Fog. Just what we needed. What do we do now? - Why don't we hide in the fog? The fog is too dangerous, Wickie. - More dangerous than Shriekable Sven? Hopefully not! Row into the fog! - What? Row! Here, my backup sword. - Thanks. What are you all so worried about? - The fog is our greatest enemy. If we reach the end of the world, we'll get sucked under the waterfall, gurgle for a bit and then the reaper! I can hear the waterfall rumble. - That was my stomach. I think we slipped by them. Something's ahead, Chief! Take in the oars. Does someone have a torch? What is that? It looks like... a ghost ship. - The demons! We've caught them! Now we'll free our children! Prepare for boarding! I have a written excuse. I'm exempt from boarding! We are Vikings! We fear nothing! - Sorry, I forgot. I wanna come too! - No. Your knees are knocking together. I know. But maybe Ylvi is on board. Please, let me come. OK. But don't tell your mother. She'll kill me. Men, it's time! Attack! Very good men, all according to plan. Faxe, Ulme, you take the forward hatch! - Check, Chief. Snorre. You guard the way up. - Good idea! The rest, spread out! Once we've found the children, we'll bring them on our ship and let this damn scow sink! What are you waiting for? - A demon! Help! Can somebody help me? - Wait! You... That doesn't sound good. - What? That doesn't sound good. Yeah, I agree! What are you doing, Ulme? You should fight, not dance! Hey, I'm in here! Let me out! Hey, you coward. We have to get out of here! Men! Follow me! - Great, terrific. Men, the ship is going under. She's sinking! Retreat, men! Wickie, where are you? Wickie! Wickie? - Grab the rope! Things are getting tight. Any ideas? - We can hold our breath Thanks. [I don't think that's a good idea.] [Why not?] [If you open the window you'll let more water in!] Wickie! Wickie! - You have to get away from the ship, Chief, or it will take you with it! - But Wickie is here someplace! Wickie! Wickie! Oh, no. He's gone! Men, is anybody a lifeguard? [Where are the toilets?] [Yuck, you peed in the water!] [Come in!] [The window's the way up, birdbrain!] Call me birdbrain again and I'll split your skull! I take it back! I meant flea-brain! Be quiet! Somethings' wrong! -Wickie! Wickie! - Wickie! Wickie! - Where is the boy? Wickie! Wickie! - Wickie! Little Wickie will kindly report to his father on the foredeck. He is gone! Completely disappeared! Wickie, my boy. Why did you have to get caught? A fine captain we have there. Sits in the corner and cries. He has plenty of reason to. - Should we cheer him up a bit? Just don't sing! - How about a candlelight dinner? Come on. I'll give it a shot. Hi, Chief. Beautiful weather, huh? Ah, this air... The boy can't even swim! - Maybe he can now? At his age they learn fast. And if not, they always manage to bob up somehow! I think he feels better now. - Chief, somethings' rustling in the trunk! Wickie! Come on, take the cover off! - I'm not allowed to! Ah! Too bad. I thought there might be something to eat. We're looking for a little boy. - About so big. Non-swimmer. - Have you seen the tyke anywhere? Come on already, speak! I'm here by accident. Oh, did you hear? By accident. We fished him out of the sea. The water rat came like on order. To be sure. Perhaps he is our golden child. I wanna go back to my father. - Listen to him, he has a father. I never knew my father. - Shut up! What is your father's name? Halvar! Halvar of Flake. The mightiest Viking in the world! Pokka! - Cap'n. That is Halvar's son. - Oh, first-rate! My head is bursting! Oh, me too! Such a headache! - How can it be that Halvar's son is left over? I told you, we need all the children! The word hasn't gotten around, apparently. But I assure you, Cap'n, heads will roll! I hope so! Lock him up! We'll take him to T?le's Horn. Right. Course south, southeast, you slimy cuttlefish! Ah! And don't cause us any trouble, little toad. He won't get out of there. I wouldn't have relied on you. - I made him shit his pants! Did you see his face? - Set the sail! Move it! Pokka, I'm hungry! I'll see what I can rustle up. - Throw up that cable! So, Falke brat, I hope you can peel potatoes. The rat used a swordfish! And I expressly told him not to cause trouble! - Pokka, where are my potatoes? Faster! [Chinese] Damn! that's what I thought! - What? That I don't understand him. I'm Tjure, truly. And if you're up to voyages and plunder, I'd really like to get to know you better. I'll teach her our language in the meantime. It's my fault. I shouldn't have let Wickie go on the demon ship! That was no demon ship! - She speaks our language! She learned it all from me! - It was a circus ship. The crew wasn't made up of demons, but of artists. - Artists? I think that's a disease! - We were attacked by pirates. I don't know what happened to the crew. It happened so fast. The pirates stole our masks and then vanished. What kind of masks? Like this! Drink! My name is Lee Fu. Hello, Lee Fu! Are you thinking the same thing I am, Faxe? - I'd like to go on a cooking cruise with her. What were you doing in the trunk? - I was a stowaway. It's lucky that you're safe and sound. - Thanks for rescuing me. No Problem! Hello! Father, I'm here! Hello! Wickie! Men, my boy is back! He's running over the water! Wickie! Wickie! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Grief has driven him crazy. - No, it's true. It's really him! I'm so happy! Father! Wickie! My son! My little one! I'm so glad you found us! Are you OK? You've grown so big! How's school? - What? I'm still so befuddled! - I know who stole the children. It was Shriekable Sven! - Language! They're sailing to the Horn of T?le! - 'Twas a toilsome trouble for T?le, but we tolerated T?le's toilsome trouble. - The Horn of T?le is no cape. It is a Viking horn with magical powers. Here comes another of his stories! - I've heard it before. Yeah, me too. - Let him speak! Long ago there lived in Toeland a king named Toele. King Toele was unlucky. He had 13 children, but his whole life long they had only lied to him. He decided that an honest child should inherit his estate. Therefore he had a magic troll cast him a magic Viking horn: The Horn of Toele. Only a child who had never lied could sound this horn and open the gate to King Toele's treasure. A Toele Gate! - That's why Sven needs our children. He won't have any luck with my kid. The little shitter lies like a rug. Sven only used the legend of the demon ship to fool us! Yeah, he stole the dragon masks to make us think they were demons! Does anyone know the way to the Horn of Toele? - I know it! I can lead you there. At the same time, only 95 nautical miles away Sven met up with his third ship, that he had sent to Flake to steal the children. - You finally got here! What took you so long? - Wer nuu ubby lettu! Ahhu, eeh wuuh tuh! - Huh? Aye tuunk uuh waay! -Ah! Soo cluur! Hee ooud us! Oooh wee aahn! - Take off the stupid mask, idiot! Oh my head! It's a bloody Swedish sauna under there! That's better! - What took you so long? Yeah, I want to know too! - The worst sea voyage of my life! With all those kids on board--tedious! - Will you cut it out? I'm telling you for the last time! - Where are the toilets? Can somebody unlock 'em for me? - I'd rather be flogged! I'll get us out of here somehow! - If Wickie were here he'd have an idea. - But your stupid Wickie isn't here. So we'll do it my way! - Ow! Who did that? I'm gonna tell your parents! Cut it out, you two. Next mistake means the ultimate penalty! Just like him! Do we understand each other, Tulpe? Loud and clear! Come, Nelke, we're going. Why do you give in? He thinks he's something special! Don't let yourself get pushed around! Just like in school! They're always putting you down! - I have the impression that our co-workers keep getting older. - Those are my parents. Your what? - Well, you know, they work cheap! You are good. Very, very good. - Yeah? Yeah! Set the sail! You heard him, men. Gentlemen and Vikings, That is Pump Island. On Pump Island King Toele built a tower. It stands here on this cape. A path leads up from the bay. From the east you have to go around the island. With a good wind it takes about 4 days! - And where is the Horn of Toele? It hangs here, at the top of the tower! - Ramon Martinez Congaz, from the Royal Spanish Dispatch Department. Our public is certainly wondering how you came by this pertinent information. - I took it as an elective. I have a thing for women with electives! What the hell is an elective? - Look at me when I'm talking to you! Why don't you have a wife? - Yeah, you're sure old enough. Nah, I never really wanted one. - Come on, don't give us that. You're a neat guy. - Yeah. A little fat, maybe, but if a woman likes you that won't bother her. Women like to be courted! - You're just too shy, Faxe. If you like a girl, just speak up! Just speak up! Just speak up! - Hahwissn nuvilli ilibaliwo! No one has ever said anything so beautiful to me before. I think he's lost his mind. - Never had much to lose. If I follow what you're saying, Sven's gonna bring the kids to the Tower, right? Right. - We have to beat him to it. Gorm? Sven has a whole day's lead on us. - Somehow we gotta get there first. Then we can bushwhack him! - We'll have to row fast. We could throw ballast overboard. You, for example. I got it! Here's the plan! Sven needs at least 4 days to get to the bay. If in the meantime we get our ship up there, Then I know what we can do! - Get our ship up there? Just listen to his idea, Chief. - If we all push together, we can do it! Are you all muscle men, or not? Yeah! You can help too! - I'm in! Father? Good idea. Yeah! And so the Vikings set their course to Pump Island. Although except for Urobe and Lee Fu nobody understood Wickie's idea, his plan was set in motion. While Sven needed 4 days to sail to Pump Island, our Vikings took a short cut. Thus they needed only 2 days to reach the tower. Luckily Faxe was very hungry, for without him the crew never would have managed the steep incline. It'd weigh a lot less if everyone was off the ship, Chief. - Shut up. Everything OK? - Like clockwork! The hides are ready too! I have to admit, sometimes your ideas are almost as good as mine. How's it going? What d'ya mean? What'cha think I'm doin'? I mean the girl. - What's with the stupid questions? You've cast your eyes upon her! - She's nothing special. Better than your old lady. She'd give out quicker if you rolled her! Hey! Keep your mouth off my old lady! Never have! - Snorre, Tjure, cut it out! Come on, come on you Bonsai! Hey! What's the matter back there? How did it happen that a woman like you, such a lovely cupcake, ended up a stowaway on a circus ship? - My family was very poor. We couldn't afford the passage, it was much too high. I write down, 95 percent. - My father wanted to sell me. But that would have broken my mother's heart. So she told me to run away, the farther away, the better! They're probably in prison now. And what are your plans now? - I don't know. I will probably never see my family again. Very sad. I have emotions. I know how you feel: Sensitive! I also have no more family. Perhaps we should start a new one together? - What? I know what you are thinking! - What? That I have beautiful teeth. But we shouldn't go too fast. I still need more time. Now! This reaction is completely normal. Bravo, men. I'm very happy! We're almost there! Cap'n, would you come a bit closer? - You got a problem? No, but otherwise I won't get the oars in the water! Most pirates are indeed both dangerous and evil, but 95 percent of them are damn lousy rowers. It thus took Sven and his men a very long time to reach land. Wickie thus had enough time to explain his plan to the Vikings. Can you see anything? - They're bringing the children on land. Is Ylvi with them? - Yes. Forward! Faster! What are you laughing at, doof? - Haven't you understood? Why don't we get moving? - We'll hack 'em to bits. That's a good plan, men. Let's do it! Attack! We were supposed to sneak up on them! Look at that! - What the hell? That must be our parents. - Then Wickie is nearby! It's Halvar's band of idiots. How did they get here? Hurry up! Pokka, come with me! Get the rest of the men from the ship! Come on, snot noses! Get a move on! -Yeah, yeah. They're already in the tower! - I'll give the signal. Good luck. The Horn of Toele! Come on! Blow! - Why should we do that? So we don't roast you for dinner. - Can we begin, please? Put the little toad to the test. Uncle Sven is becoming impatient. Next! Stop! - Why did you stop? He told us to! - Sven's brought them all upstairs! Come. Bunch of liars! If you want to save your friends, take a deep breath! You snake, you'll pay for that! - That wasn't very smart of you. Why don't you pick on someone your own size? - You're risking a very fat lip. I'm not afraid of you, or of him. We're Vikings! The children! Father! - Cap'n. Look out! Now what's going on? The tower is giving up the treasure. Go get him! Look out! You've got to get out of here, Wickie! - To the window, Ylvi! Wickie! It worked! I wished for you to come! We have to hurry, Ylvi. Come on! - OK! It's a long way down! - Let me through! What was that? -The signal! It's time! I thought it was tinnitus. It must be a large treasure! We'll need a bigger boat! I saw it first! Snorre! Don't move, or you're hamburger! Come on, slide down! - What? There? Uh-uh. Retreat, men! Back, back, hurry! n...n...not far! Why do I always have to be the first? - Do it! Wow! Welcome on board! - Hey! Stay here! Go! Faster! Snorre, come on, Snorre, wake up! Who am I going to fight with if you're not there? How many are still up there? - Only Wickie and Ylvi! It's going to be close! - Hold on tight! Wait! - What is it? I...The two of us... - Huh? You know. - No. Oh, men! Come with me, you little minx! - Let her go! Let her go! No! No, she's coming with me. Lots of fun in Valhalla. Let her go! She's done nothing to you! - Sweetie! Now I could use some muscles! - You called? You're welcome! - Father! Halvar! - Everything OK? Out with you! And what about you? - Three is too heavy! Go! Well done, boy! - Thanks, likewise! Come on! We have to go! - Soon on the way! What did Wickie say? - He said we have to go! No, Faxe! It's too soon! - Wake up, Snorre. Put up the mast! - Mast up! Did you just slug me? - Snorre! Get in, Faxe, you can do it! Did I hurt you? I'm coming! Hey, don't leave yet! The dragon is alive! Wait! It's me! Your chief! Run, Father, run! - The cliff! I don't know if that was such a good idea, Wickie! Can you please hold my hand? - You have to trust me! Launch the hides! - You heard him, men! Here! Grab on! We're flying! - And without wings! Hold on, Father. We'll pull you up. - Heave ho, heave ho! Shit. They're in league with evil powers! - Why are you standing around? You have to stop them! -Goddammit! The rotten sea slugs are flying away! - Heave ho, heave ho! Wickie, did you see how I flattened Sven? Yeah, you were super, Father. - Come here, my boy! Sorry. - Forget it. You'll be sorry! The treasure is mine! You'll rue this day! I'll indict you! I'll see you behind bars! We'll see each other in court! Careful. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, hm? Who is that? - Ramon Martinez Congaz, from the Royal Spanish Dispatch Department. I need an effective coda. - Shut the hell up! We're flying like birds! I've wished for that my whole life. Thanks, Wickie. - No problem. What did you want to say to me before? - Well, that I... that you and I... - You're no weakling, like I thought! Thanks. - And back in Flake we can mess about like cats and dogs, right? - Oh, that's a cool offer. Wickie? - Be right back. What a guy! You did it, my boy! I am damn proud of you! We did it. All together. But I lost my helmet. You what? - Sorry! Do you know what happens to a Viking who loses his helmet? He gets a new one! Golly! You really earned it, my son. And now, to the helm! Men and women of Flake! Odin has once again favored us! We have freed our children, defeated Sven the Shriekable, and seized a great treasure! It was me! I found the treasure! It was me! But the treasure isn't ours! - Boy, what do you mean? The treasure belongs to Ylvi. She is the heir of King Toele! Have you forgotten? What did he say? - If that's true, Ylvi, then tell us what will you do with it? Lee Fu should get the treasure! - Objection! Overruled! - Lee Fu can rescue her family with it! And she helped to free us! Yes, there's something to that. I think that's right! We should go for it. - Yes! Can I bring you home? - If you take me out for coffee! What a shame. The beautiful gold! - But we got our son in exchange. And isn't that our greatest treasure? Yeah. And so in the village of Flake all was as before. Faxe brought Lee Fu back to China on the galley. But nothing came of it. For coffee didn't agree with Faxe, which made Faxe very sad. He went into a cloister because the food was good. But during fasting season he came back to Flake. Wickie was also happy to be home. He was no longer so keen about going to sea with the Vikings. Until one day he didn't have a choice. But that is another story. The ship's going under! She sinks! - And she sings better than Ulme. What's with the get-up? - I thought it was a good idea.
