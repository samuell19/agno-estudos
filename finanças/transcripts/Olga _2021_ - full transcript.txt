One, two, three. Come on, Sasha! Guys, catch up to them! Come on, Olga! You guys are too slow! Well, Stas? Well? - Who's the boss? - We buried you. You'd be less mouthy at soccer. Yeah, right. What's the matter, Andrei, you dead? Such a wimp. Sasha, Olga! What the hell are you doing? Hi, Vasily. Hi. Test training session, on the double. We're out of water. I'll fill it up. The spray's not working. Put some on the upper bar. Hold on. Go ahead. Good luck. Go ahead, Olga. Full stretch! Come on, nail it. - Watch your posture. - Use your hands. Easy. Come on, come on. Keep going. You're strong enough. Watch your hands! Good. Straighten your back. Point your toes! Full stretch! Good job. Sasha, go ahead. I'm not fully using my hands. And I'm not extending my legs. Same with my toes. The next step will be the Jaeger. With the Jaeger, you'll blow them away in the Euro. You're capable of it, Olga. Hey, Mom. Hey, lovebug. We have to be here tomorrow at 1:30 pm for the tournament. Yeah, I know. I talked to Sasha's parents. They'll pick you up at noon. Aren't you taking me? I can't. I really have to be in the newsroom tomorrow. I'm working on an important article. It's due tomorrow... What about my tournament, isn't that important? There's only two left before the Euro. I kept tomorrow night open for you. Great. We'll go out to dinner, just the two of us. Fine. I don't need your night out. That's the fifth time. "My article, my article..." What if I help you finish it instead of going to the tournament? Let's not ruin the evening. And since when do you need me? My warrior who wins every tournament? Leave me alone. You always get your way, don't you? They're building fast. With all the bribes they give to the Mayor... I had written about illegal construction sites. But nothing's changed. People either don't care or they're too scared. Just once in your life, you could at least pretend to be listening. But you're just rambling, Mom. Are you hungry? Mom, what's going on? Faster! Mom, the streetcar! They're gone. Are you okay? Bastards! I knew it! It's okay, Mom. I'm sorry. Hello, young lady. Hello. - How was the trip? - How are you? Great, thanks. Hi. - Hello. - Nice tometu. Here's the folder. It's all there, including her mom's number. But don't hesitate to call me if need be. Thanks. The insurance as well? Yes, everything's in the folder. There you go. Welcome. Follow me. Let me show you your room. This way. Here's the bathroom. There you go. Please feel at home. It's beautiful. Great. Glad to hear. I'll let you get settled, okay? Thanks. This is llona. Please leave a message. I made it there, call me back. You're in my thoughts. Love, Mom. Don't worry. Hey, Sasha. I just made it to the Center. I can finally get back to it. The gym is so cool. I'll show you. You're not gonna believe it. It's not like that dump in Kyiv. Here's the beam, check out how long it is. Then there's... the bars. It's actually like back home, except a lot classier. Yeah, well... Anyway... I'm gonna try the Jaeger. I can show you, if you want. Other than that, I miss you guys. I hope to see you soon. Check this out, girl. Let me show you who's boss. Shit. Damn, did you see what she did? You okay? Did you hurt yourself? No. I'm Steffi. Hi. Olga. I'm the team captain. Come see me if you have a problem. Okay? Olga. - Were you doing the Jaeger on your own? - No. Don't train on your own. Okay? - Okay. - I mean it. Don't do that again. Hi, girls, how are you? - Hi. - Hi. How are you feeling? How's your back, Naomi? - Better. - Okay, great. - You okay, Steffi? - Yeah. - How's that elbow, Justine? - Good. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Well, girls, as you can see, we have a new gymnast today. This is Olga. - Hi. - Hi. Olga might join the National Team. She's gonna train with us for the competitions. It's a trial period for now, but I'm counting on you all to make her feel welcome. Let's start with cardio. Move it. In rhythm, girls. Come on. Again. And... go. Five, four, three, two, one, go. Watch out! Can't you see the sequence? - I can. - Go to the climbing rope. Come on. Do you wanna go? Steffi, go to the bars. Come on, Olga, climb. Shit... Here, that's for your hands. Thanks. You're from Kyiv, is that it? Yes. And you? From Satigny, near Meyrin. You don't know where that is, do you? She obviously doesn't. - How could she know? - Don't worry about it. Nobody knows where it is, it's bumfuck nowhere. Hey, knock it off. You're the bumfucks. It's true, though. What's a "bumfuck?" Who wants to explain? How can I put it? I don't know. Figure it out. Let's see... - I'll give you five bucks if you do it. - Forget it. Forget it, she doesn't understand. Let's go. Yeah, the bell's about to ring. Don't forget to call me. Yeah. - I'm ready. - Ready? - Yeah. - Shall we? Let's go, girls. It looks big. It's cool. I feel reassured. Mom, you never answer when I call. I was really worried. Don't worry, everything's fine. Are you kidding me? I know you're in danger. Of course I'm worried. Don't be. I just got back from the newsroom with Stas, you know how burly he is. Everything's fine, I'm telling you. Did they arrest them? Of course not, they'll never get arrested. That's fucked up. It is. Listen, we need to talk about your application. Did you send it? You need to sign it, otherwise I won't be able to stay. And I can kiss the Euro goodbye. The selection is a month from now. You don't get it. It's not that simple. Mom, that's my only chance to compete in the Euro. Olga, they're asking you to become a Swiss citizen. Ukraine doesn't allow dual citizenship. I'm already half Swiss. Yeah, right, half Swiss. Especially since this Swiss half has only seen her father's side of the family twice in her entire life. I don't even know what to say. You just can't be a dual citizen. Do you understand how important this choice is? Look, the foster home is right across from the gym. Are you even listening to me? Mom, it's not my fault if I'm here. Well... You're the one who's in trouble, not me. I understand you're totally focused on gymnastics. But how long will that last? Two, three years? Maybe five? Have you thought about your future? If you don't sign, I'll do it for you. How are you doing? Okay. Have you made any friends? Almost. Why do you mean, "almost?" I don't understand them well. Don't cry. Anyway... You're my warrior, right? Okay. Alright, Mom. Bye. - Good night. - I love you. I love you, too. Good night. Bohdia was the boss of all spiders. He ate flies and mosquitoes. He even ate out of my hands. He was a well-trained spider! Bohdia was the boss of all spiders. He ate flies and mosquitoes. Too bad, Bohdia... Check out her body alignment. Her style is so fluid. Look at that side flip. That rhythm. It's really beautiful. Yeah, well... That was two years ago. Didn't you see her yesterday? True that. Come on, Juliette She hasn't practiced in weeks. Let her get her feet wet. Hey. Hey. Hi, Olga. Do you have your school stuff? - No. - You don't? - Bye. - Bye. Bye. We're gonna meet every week to work on your French. You can't just show up late and nonchalantly. Do you understand? We're still gonna try to get a little work done. Have a seat, I'll get you a pen. Yes, sir. What was that? You call that a landing? Don't you know any better? Leave me alone. Did you say something? You got something to tell me? I won't tolerate that attitude. No! Not like that. I'm asking you to do the Tkatchev. Okay? Yes. Come on, Olga. Tkatchev. Come on. Olga, no. Olga. You don't get it. The Tkatchev. The reverse grip is a Jaeger. Hey. Unbelievable. Step away. Steffi. - Can you show her the Tkatchev? - Yeah. Olga, watch. There you go. Very good. Excellent. Great job. Just like that, Olga. Come on. Come on, Olga. Tkatchev, okay? No! Olga! Not the Jaeger, the Tkatchev. I keep telling you. Back home, I don't do like you do. You're not ready. You're not ready for the Jaeger. No way. You're gonna hurt your back. I need the Jaeger for the Euro. Not your stupid moves. Excuse me? Get lost. Hey. You can't speak Russian here. We don't understand. It's either French or German. The girls don't understand. Tkatchev? That's what I've been asking you. Don't play me for a fool if you wanna stay here, okay? Okay. Why are you here? Here? What the hell are you doing in Switzerland? My father is Swiss. And what does he do? He's dead. Sorry. It's okay. There's also my mom. Because of her work, I really had to leave. She writes on the Internet about Yanukovych. Yanu-what? Ya-nu-ko-vych. The President of Ukraine. Got it. He wanted to kill my mom and me. That's why I'm here. People can't speak freely. You run the risk of being spied on. Take my mom, for example... Coming from Ukraine, you realize things aren't so bad elsewhere. When you live in Ukraine, you understand that other countries carry fleas. The ruling power takes the people for idiots. The people hold a moron. And one. And two. Activate. And three. Two. Three. Arms straight and... That was better. Very good. Are you starting to get the Jaeger? Come on, take this off. Let's see if you belong here. Come on. Come on, strong swing. There you go. Okay, great. And... Strong. There you go! Now we're talking. That was a beautiful Jaeger. Very good. Come on, that's enough. Hey, Olga. That's it for today. You're gonna hurt yourself. Stop. See? What did I say? You're too tired. Enough, you're done. Stretch and then beddy-byes. Beddy-byes? Yeah, beddy-byes. That means sleep French. Go learn French instead of cursing me out in Russian. Ciao! See you tomorrow. Vasily's gone? Yeah. He left on a whim. Damn, just before the Euro? Yeah, I don't know what we're gonna do. Holy shit, that's crazy. I guess the Russians made him a better offer. Either that or he really wants to dope his athletes. Maybe. Oh, by the way, the new coach... What about her? She's clueless. We'll never be ready for the championship. Who's going with you to the Euro? Alla, Polina, Masha, and Katya. What about Vika and Tanya? Vika's on the Azerbaijani Team now. And Tanya left when the coach did. Who's that? Is she the one who took my spot? Sasha? Hold on, let me go outside... Yeah. That's the new girl. What is she like? She gets on my nerves. And on top of that, I swear, she stinks. She's a handful, I tell you. She stinks? Yes. It's like she never showers. She's terrible. What about over there? What? How are the Swiss? Pretty proficient. It's okay. The showers are great and there's also a sauna and a swimming pool. So you're Swiss now? Oh, stop it. When are you coming back? Soon. Watch out, I'm the boss now. Yeah, right. Until I come back, at least. Yeah. But you're not coming back, are you? I told you. Soon. Hey, I gotta go. Okay, bye. Bye. That's good, keep it up. What are you doing? I'm falling! Fucking cops! Why? Get back! Hi, Olga? Where are you? Maidan Square I can't talk right now! Mom, go home! Go home, you hear me? Are you okay, Olga? Yes. Around 3 am, the people who were peacefully demonstrating, mainly students who had gathered in Maidan Square, were violently dispersed by riot police who had been ordered to clear up the square. Come on, get up! Nearly one hundred students and journalists were arrested. Dozens of people suffered serious injuries. What are you doing? The rallying call had been made on social media. The protesters are contesting the cancelation of the trade agreement with the European Union by President Yanukovych. A cancelation that plays into the hands of Russia. The protesters see this trade agreement with Europe as the country's only hope for change. Shame on you! Shame on you! There you go, nice. Good job, Olga. Watch your round-off. - Push with your arms. - I know. Steffi, what are you doing? That's terrible. You have no rhythm! Any news from home? - Wanna talk about it? - No. There you go, great. Steffi, you wanna make the Euro? That's how I want your round-off. In the axis, with some energy. Come on, switch apparatuses. No! I'll do it again. Switch. Go to the uneven bars. Awesome vibe, you guys. This girl's not normal. Look at her. She's a fucking robot. In French, per favore. Lazy bum. What did you say? Yeah, you. Fuck you, you lazy bum. - Drop it, Steffi. - Don't touch me. What did you say? You don't belong here. I'll fuck you up, bitch. - Calm down! - Let go of her! Let her go! You got it? Asshole. Enough, Steffi, enough! Steffi, please, sit down. - What's going on here? - You know exactly what's going on. You're the National Team captain. We have a championship coming. What's with the fighting like children? Want me to tell the Federation and sponsors to cancel the whole thing? Olga, can you please look at me? I skipped practice so I could be with my brother! It's all good anyway, I was selected for the Euro Olga, can you hear this mess? Out with the thug! It's crazy what happened. Everyone's in shock. Can you hear them? Folks are coming from everywhere! I've never seen so many people. It's the revolution, Olga. Damn, I wish you were here. For shame! For shame! Out with Yanukovych! Get over here. We're all going to Maidan. Praise Ukraine! Praise Maidan! All together: “Revolution of dignity!" Revolution... Of dignity! - Revolution... - Of dignity! Free Ukraine! Kiss Lenin goodbye! Revolution! Revolution! You okay? I'm fine. Don't tell me you're scared. No. Don't worry, they won't bite. It's beautiful. It looks great on you. Make sure you don't machine wash it, kharacho? Have a small glass. No, thanks. Come on, it's Christmas. No. Are you kidding, Bertrand? She can't. Go give Dad a glass. There you are. I'm happy to see you. - This is for you. - Thanks. Use it to buy whatever you please. Thank you. Here's your dad. Nice picture, right? He's handsome. And this is a cousin... Dad, who is that? That was Alfred. Uncle Alfred. Was that Alfred? Look. That's him. Hey, look at that cutie. About 20. - Wow, 20 medals. - Maybe even 21. Can I see that one, please? - Look. - Thanks. Yep. She was on the podium. Who's that with my dad? That's Nadine. Right? That's Nadine, isn't it? Yeah, that's Nadine. She was your dad's first wife I went to school with her. That was before he met your mom. - And who is this? - How come I don't know your mom? She's far away. Okay. Still. After everything that happened to you, she could've come. It's true that... things are getting really dangerous over there. In Kyiv. Why is it dangerous? There's a revolution. A "revolution," Let's not get carried away. Then why is it dangerous? Because there's people vandalizing everything. They're fighting and rioting. No, it's about freedom. Freedom, sure. But it's confusing to us. Some of them wanna join the European Union... The European Union? Big whoop. Not to mention hardcore nationalists. they're super violent. You and your stupid theories. - Enough already, let her speak. - I'm just explaining. She might wanna say something. Well, yeah, go ahead. Meanwhile, how convenient for her to have us take care of her daughter. She's an irresponsible person. - Irresponsible? - Dad, knock it off. Casually leaving her daughter on her own? And you think that's okay? Don't talk about my mother. My mother's doing her job. Hello? Hey, Mom. How are you? Happy holidays! Why does Grandpa hate you so much? Grandpa? Your dad had only come to Kyiv for his dissertation. But he ended up staying. Grandpa never forgave me. I forgive you. I saw pictures of Dad. You're starting to look like him more and more. Are you in Maidan? Yeah, in the press section. You must be happy, they're keeping you busy. Well, yeah, and that's only the beginning I can imagine. What about you? Everything good? I'm getting ready for the Euro. I'm working on my Jaeger. It's still not looking great. - Be right there. - I would need another month. llona, hurry. Things are moving! I have to go. I'll call you back. Are you serious? We barely started talking. Hey, watch your tone. You don't give a shit about me! People are getting beat up and you just want me to sit there? Fuck you! Police attempted a break as recently as this evening. But the barricades held still. Volunteers continue to flock from all around the country. People have been camping here for a month. They've organized so as to maintain control of the square. Ukrainians are demanding a true democracy. They will only get it if the President steps down and corrupt institutions are cleaned up. And they will remain there no matter what. Retreat to the square! Quick! Olga, the entire future of Ukraine is at stake. You need to understand. This is your country, whether you like it or not. I mailed your application. Do whatever you want. But please pick up. Olga, answer me! What are you doing, proofreading? Spell-checking? You don't need to read it, it's fine. Okay? Just sign. Welcome to the Swiss National Team. You're welcome. Hey, easy. Come on, girls. It is what it is. There'll be other selections. Let's stay focused. Come on. She definitely got her feet wet. That's good for the team, is it not? Just fantastic. Zoé, your floor diagonal isn't good enough. We couldn't select you. But you have this gala... Please. Hey, just go to the beam. There's nothing you can do. Fuck! Use your heels when you jump. Come on. Come on. Come on, Zoé! Go all the way. Come on, Zoé! Zoé? What the hell is wrong with you? Sorry. No! Come on, Zoé, help me. Go ahead. Come on. Zoé! Are you okay? Zoé, are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. No harm done? I don't belong here anymore. I'm done I'll be close-by, Olga. Will you come see me? Is there a problem? What did you give him? Her visa's expired. Do we take her in or...? I made a mistake. That's okay. I'll be right there. Mom, check this out. This is crazy. That's where it all goes down tomorrow. And I promise... we're gonna win for sure. Who's the boss, eh? Sasha? - Hi, bitch. - Hi! What's up, chica? We finally made it to the Euro. Hey, Olga! Hey! My girls. Watch out, you're turning red. Shut up, you idiot. Still, it looks weird. Stop it. When did you get here? In the middle of the night. We got stuck at the border in Kyiv. Forget it. What did you do to your hair? You look like a dude. That way, nobody gives me shit on the barricades Sasha! Practice! She's a pain in the ass. Anyway, let's link later, okay? Sure. What's wrong with you? Go practice. Good. Excellent. Tanya, your turn. Yanukovych is trying to screw us with his new laws. The cops can arrest you for anything, even if you're just holding a helmet. That's insane. So instead of helmets people are wearing pans. Can you imagine? I can totally see you with a pan on your head. The second you step foot in Maidan, it's like an instant rush. I can't even explain. You're always needed for something. whether it's handing out tea or medicine, blankets, and so on. I put a tent back up that the cops had taken down. I mean can you picture me doing all that? My brother doesn't want me to go anymore. He says it's too risky or what not. I don't care, I'm gonna go back. Hold on. When we sing at night, everyone turns on the flashlights on their phones. The square and all the streets around it just light up. Like in a fairy-tale. When we return, brother. We shall govern. Our nation. For our freedom. We shall give. Our souls. And our bodies. We shall prove. Brother. That we are the descendants. Of the Cossacks. For our freedom We will give Our souls and our bodies. After the tournament, I'm putting you in my suitcase, okay? Sasha, look. That's Vasily! What's wrong with you? Let him stay in Russia. if he likes it so much. Stop it. Anyway, let's beat the shit out of them tomorrow, okay? Olga. Come on, hurry up I'm gonna get in trouble. Good luck. We're a good team now. Juliette as an alternate, that's a pity. She's better than Vivienne. You and me, we can get enough points tomorrow. Andrea is nervous. You need to talk to her before her start. I'm not ready for the final stretch of my floor exercise I can't do it. Yes, you can. I've seen you do it before. You're really good. Tomorrow... we can't be afraid, okay? Okay. Hold them back! Get down! Damn, what time is it? Olga, open up! Olga! Olga. Sasha? - You need to see this. - What are you doing here? It's your mother. Mom? Things got out of hand tonight. Show me! Where are you taking her? To Central Hospital. What the hell are you doing? Did she say something? We need to call the hospital. It's llona Budiashkina, the journalist. Didn't she say anything? Come on, call the hospital. It's gonna be okay. Network overload. Try again. Just answer me this, please. Just tell me how she's doing! I'm unable to come, don't you understand? I can't! She's my mother, just answer me I just wanna know how she's doing. I would come if I could, but I can't, that's impossible. Please, I'm begging you. Please. Good evening, everyone, and welcome! Thank you for being with us! A total of 210 athletes from 34 countries are about to enter the arena. All are hoping to give their very best and to possibly take home the title of European Champion. Olga I'll be right there. Olenka. UISSE I'm so sorry. I saw what happened to your mom. Don't ever talk to me again. What's the matter? Why are you saying that? You chose your side. This is sports, not politics. Don't fuck it up. On the beam, Candela Gomez from Spain, who had medalled in 2012. Beautiful! On the vault, Sophie Chatelain for France. Good luck! 12.7 for the Frenchwoman. If you're not feeling it, Juliette can do it. No, I'm fine. What a pity for Julia. As we await Gabelgaard's result on the beam... Come on, come on! Hey, stop. Stay here. Calm down! Stop it! Stop. If you move, you're out. Olga, don't let them push us around! Our apologies for this unforeseen incident. Yes... the competition is about to resume... Okay. Porsche-Arena, let's hear it, everyone! She's the reigning champion from last year's individual event. Come on, let's go. Come on. Olga? It's your mother. Hello? Mom? Mom, can you hear me? Are you there? It's not working. What do you mean, it's not working? Hello? Mom, show yourself. No camera, okay? No, with it. Don't worry, I'm safe here. You weren't answering. What do you mean, you're safe? How are you? I wanna see you. I saw the footage... of your performance in the Euro. No, let's not talk about that. Show yourself. I haven't seen or heard you for too long. Don't be afraid. Okay? Okay. I don't look so good. Come on, show yourself, please. I can't believe it. Don't cry. Are you in pain? No, I'm okay. Everything's fine, I told you. Who did this to you? This was meant to happen, since nothing ever changes around here. I'm gonna come home. I forbid you. I need to be with you. Not now. I'm begging you. When? Take a look, Olga. You see this line on your metatarsal? That's a stress fracture. You must've compounded the impacts for some time. How long have you been hurting? Why didn't you say so? I don't know. Do you remember a fall or feeling a snap? No. Well, I can't give you an opinion on the Olympic test event. I'm not ruling it out, but we'll have to see how things evolve. Olga, this is your body laying its boundaries I don't want you to move at all. If it worsens you can kiss gymnastics goodbye. You okay? There you go. That was great. Chin up. Nice. There you go, Andrea. A cop on Hrushevsky Street. It's all burned down over there. There was a girl next to me. And right in front of her, a grenade went off. I freaked out. So I threw my Molotov cocktail. On the cop. His whole body caught fire. People around me were yelling, "Praise Ukraine! Praise the heroes!" And he just... fell. And what did you do? I ran away. Like a chicken. It was self-defense, that's all. That other girl could've been you. He got what he deserved. This is going too far, I won't be going back. You can't give up. You're not gonna give up, are you? Olga, you don't understand what it's like over here. After what they did to my mom? You think it only happened to her? Don't throw in the towel, you just can't. No, Olga, I'm here every day. People are dying, don't you get it? People are dying every day. It's horrible, Olga I don't know why I keep talking to you. You're sitting in your nice, comfy room. You know full well I didn't choose to be here. You know I wanna be with you guys. That's bullshit. Fuck you! Olga? I need help. - What? - I need your help, Zoé. Hold on, come over here. I need to go to the airport. What do you mean, the airport? I can't go on my own, it's too far. I need to go back to Kyiv. But Olga, they won't let you go. You're a minor, they won't let you through. They will! They will let me through. 'III explain it to them, Zoé. No, that's not possible. Let me drive you back to... No, I have to go! Please. You're the only one who can help me. Everything okay? Yes, thank you. Please. No, Olga. Can't you see it's useless? Thank you so much. What were you thinking, trying to leave like that? Do you really think that's the best solution to help your country? You'll ruin your feet with this shit. Get some rest. And then, do what you do best. Train, prepare for the Olympics. That's something positive. Your mom and I spoke on the phone. She's proud of you. So proud. Olga, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna get treatment. Then we'll train intensely. Together. And you'll go to the Olympics. Let's not do that again. Guys, we need help! Check this out over there. These are snipers. Did you see what happened? How is that possible, Olga? Did you see? They fired at the crowd. What's gonna become of us, Olga? There were so many deaths that Yanukovych fled to Russia. And by the time I got home, the war broke out in the East and Crimea was invaded. We would learn to live with it. I saw the ruins in Maidan and just like everyone else, I wondered, "How am I gonna deal with all this?" Up next, Polina, a first-year student in Group B. Get in position. You'll be fine. Go ahead. Very nice. Again. Arms up. Beautiful, good job. Come on, girls. Don't be scared, Diana. It's okay. Concentrate. Let your hands go all the way. Come on, let your hands go all the way. Go ahead.
