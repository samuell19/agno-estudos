Hong Gil Dong? - Hong Gil Dong! - Run! - So you're that fellow. - Now's my turn. You're the one that killed Teuk Jae's gang five days ago, right? It was your Yongmun Organization, wasn't it? Looks like your wound hasn't healed yet. Now I feel bad. You must be the bastard son of Minister Hong that brought thieves to rob his house. Since you'll be killed if you get caught, I'll do it for you. If you kill me, that's fine. But I hope you don't get killed. If you die, I'll be in trouble. I said I wasn't following you! I was looking for my friend! Put that away! Hey! How can you accuse me of something and then just walk away? You have the face of a thug! Why are you and all your Yongmun folks all so mean? That's why you get stabbed! What did you say? Didn't your Young Master tell you? I saved him! Well, I'm not surprised. He left without a word. What is it? Isn't she the girl we saw in front of the headquarters? Didn't you say you didn't know her? I don't know him at all! I really don't! What's going on? Why are you alone? Someone was following us and I was looking into it. His wounds have not yet healed. Go and assist him! Yes, Madam. Let's go. You're as pretty as a girl, but your swordsmanship is pretty good. You look like you've killed a few men. I heard you were a thug, and it appears your fighting skills are good. You're probably in a lot of pain. Why don't we stop before your stomach bursts? - Worry about yourself. - My worry is that you'll die. That's enough! I don't like fighting with you. It's better if you don't move. What will you do now? Hand me over to the police? I heard Yongmun was backed by the Vice Minister. I suppose you wouldn't fear the police. - Why did you kill Teuk Jae's gang? - Don't ask questions. The reason they were killed is because they saw something they shouldn't have. If your goal is to use me to reveal the truth, then you should stop now. Anyone who tries to stand in my way, the police, the guards, even your father... I will kill them all. If you leave now, I won't take your life. You... take human lives lightly. Why are you so proud of taking human lives? - What are you? - That's not for you to know. - We'll get him. - Let him go. No need for that. He doesn't know anything. He's just looking for the thieves' killer. If he doesn't find anything, he'll come find me again. He was with that medicine peddler. She must have told him you were involved. - I saw her on the way here. - I told you to pretend you didn't know her. But... Madam Noh saw the girl, as well. Madam Noh? Here. You were on the same ship from China? At first, I didn't know he was the Young Master of such a big organization! I heard you are Madam Noh. Does that mean his surname is Noh, too? What is your name, young lady? - It's Yi Nok. - Yin Ok? No. Yi for happiness and Nok for blue. Yi Nok? How old are you? Is your surname Ryu? It's Heo Yi Nok. My grandfather named me. I see. Why do you ask? I am looking for a girl whose name is Yi Nok. Ryu Yi Nok. It's a unique name. I'm just Heo Yi Nok. But honestly, I don't know if I deserve such a nice reception. But in any case, is the Young Master alright? - What? - I saw him running around everywhere. If his stab wound gets infected, he'll be in big trouble! I see. So you have seen the wound. When I first saw him on the ship, I thought he was a mercenary for hire. But now that I see him here, he looks like a merchant, too. But when I saw him wounded, I thought that he might be an assassin. What does he do, exactly? You said you didn't know him, but it appears that you know many things. No, that's not so. I don't even know his name. - So what is his name? - Ask him yourself when he comes back. The food is getting cold. Please start eating. I have to take care of some business. It's dangerous. We better get rid of her. Release the poison. She's such a nice lady! If I'm going to eat all this, I should chew my food properly. Young Master! I was just... The Prince...! Stop the poison! - Your Highness! - Bring the antidote! Hurry! She's dangerous! She saved my life. I won't let her die. Your Highness! Damn it. I should have taken the medicine from Yi Nok. Am I going to get killed trying to do this by myself? I'll help, too! We fought tigers together! No, not her. I can't get her involved in this. That hurt! Those fellows... The chief was someone worth risking our lives for. Look for China delivery boy, Gomi, if you need help. Contact us if you need anything. His name was Gomi? Now, now, move aside! It's hot! Yes! Hey, auntie, did you see that? Delivery is Gomi's specialty! I found it! Are you the China delivery boy, Gomi? No, I'm Mooni. Try writing Moon* upside down. (*Korean characters) Now I'm Gomi. Yeon Ssi told me to look for you. I heard you're the contact. I want to meet them. Are you the guy who buried our chief, Hong Gil Dong? - Are they all gathered somewhere? - No, we don't gather. - Then it'll take awhile to get them together. - No, they'll get together quickly. People are looking for me. I can't have too much noise. Don't do anything. Just look. Now we only need to wait. Let's go. Oh, your name is Gil Dong? I've stepped on poo* on the road before. (*Gil Dong - sounds like Road Poo) {\a6}Gom - Bear Your name is Gomi, right? I killed a bear in the mountains before. - Do we have to go far? - Yes. In Hyung, you might as well give up on the civil examinations. Father was so merciful to me. I should at least try. I'm proud of you, but there's only two days left. - I know, but I'll try my best! - Goodness. When you didn't study, your father was always watching. Now that you are, he's not! Speaking of which, your father hasn't come out of his chambers since that day. Look carefully at the message inscribed on it by the late king! I killed my best friend to hide the truth. What if it were his daughter...? No, that's impossible. Even if she were alive... ...she wouldn't know what happened. I told you that you would be in danger if you got involved with me. You... take human lives lightly. We have given her the antidote. She will wake up soon. I know why you did this. It has always been that way. And in a few days, many more will be killed. Have I really come to take people's lives lightly? I know that this is difficult for you. But in order to accomplish great things, there must be sacrifice. I know. My existence now required my mother's sacrifice. But she saved my life. I do not wish to take her life. Your Majesty, has something displeased you? I don't like that face. Does the new palace maid not meet your satisfaction? Leave me. I wish to be alone. When are they going to show up? Forget it. You haven't spoken since this afternoon! You were such a chatterbox earlier! Hey! Have I done something to piss you off? - Hey, it's him! - Were you the one that called us? Hong Gil Dong, I knew we would meet again. We heard what happened. - So you're wanted by the police? - You must be here to enlist our help. We'll help you with anything. It's obvious. He wants us to help him escape. Do you guys still want to fight Yongmun? Let's do it together. I want Yongmun, too. My head...! Old man, give me some water. Old Man! My head...! What happened? I was in the middle of eating delicious food... Did I dream it? What are you doing here? You're at Yongmun headquarters. Do you remember anything? So it wasn't a dream? I was in the middle of eating... ...and then I saw you. You fainted as soon as you saw me. Fainted? Me? Yes. That can't be. Fainting is what noble ladies do. I don't faint! There's no way I would... ...faint. I must have really fainted. I've passed out from too much alcohol before. I've never fainted like this before. So there was a feminine side to me...! Why... why are you laughing? Did I just laugh? You make me laugh at the oddest moments. You're a strange girl. You're stranger than me for laughing at someone who just fainted! I've become too weak. - If you're not well, then get some more rest. - Wait! Just... give me some food. Do you... ...eat such good food everyday? You're so lucky! Do you envy me? Well, not really. My grandfather is a physician and he told me this. He said that if a person holds in his emotions and thoughts, it will manifest in his face. And if it continues, then it becomes an illness! Every time I see you, I feel like your face is always clouded. You should let some of that out before you get sick! - How do I do that? - You know...! Have a drink with your friends! Share your feelings with them! Get angry and whine about things! If you do that, you'll feel better. Yes. I'm sure that's how others live. - I should go now. - Eat some more. No. I have to go look for my friend, anyway. Friend? Something bad happened, and I have to help him. Is that friend the fellow named Hong Gil Dong? You heard the rumors about Gil Dong, too? It really wasn't Gil Dong! Some really bad guys framed it all on him. We have to get them! What will you do when you get them? I'll annihilate them! I'll be on my way then. Oh, by the way, can I say hello to you when I see you next time? Yes. Are you just going to let her leave? If she meets Hong Gil Dong, she may become your enemy. If that happens... ...then I will have to kill her. So Hong Gil Dong, those Yongmun bastards got you, too? You were so arrogant before. So now you're afraid to attack them alone? Fine. We'll include you in our plan. You already have a plan to attack Yongmun? Of course. You've underestimated the great Su Keun! - I have found a way to meet the female chief. - Female chief? Listen carefully. The chief of Yongmun is a middle-aged woman. - That's my specialty! - Fool. - We don't have a plan yet. - And we haven't found any information about them. Although I didn't expect it, I'm still a bit disappointed. How will you ever exact revenge? What about you? Do you have a plan? Of course. That's why I came to look for you. What is it then? What's your great plan? I'm going to blow up Yongmun. What? It's tomorrow. Are the soldiers ready? Most of them have already entered Dosung. Tonight, they will hide themselves near the North Gate at Mt. Ya. Have all the weapons and ammunitions been placed in the palace? All is in place except the explosives, which will go tomorrow. Yong Jin, you are in charge of the explosives. Yes, Your Highness. - There are explosives in that building. - Explosives! Are we going to blow up the explosives? That'll be fun! What's that? Give me that! That's amazing! Gomi is a bit spastic, but you'll get used to him. If that explodes in the Yongmun headquarters, the soldiers will swarm the place. Even they've got friends in high places. They will not be able to hide what happened. And when they find out their men are inside the palace, they will not go unpunished. Hey! I was going to blow up explosives, too. I was going to blow up explosives of love in the female chief's heart! Dangerous but magnetic explosions of love! Su Keun's got a one-track mind, but you'll get used to it. I'll go into Yongmun, so just keep a lookout so I can get out safely. Be careful. It'll be a waste if you come out looking like minced meat for dumplings. I wonder if we can use chopsticks to pick up the pieces of your body? Mal Nyeo is a bit freaky, but you'll get used to it. I just want the explosives to get the guards there. I don't want to harm anyone. You said you needed a wagon to hide in, right? I'm sorry. The reason I chose you was because you're the most beautiful. Be my wagon. Will everything go smoothly? What? The Sa Yin Sword was stolen? Someone entered my house for the sole purpose of stealing the Sa Yin Sword. The only two people who know about the Sa Yin Sword is you and I. - The others are dead! - Yes, Your Majesty. But if the ones who stole the sword knew of His Majesty's inscription on the blade, it is treason! That cannot be. And so what if they have the sword? The one whom Father wanted to be king is dead! That is why I am worried. There is only one person that needs the Sa Yin Sword. The prince. Your Majesty! You're getting old, Minister! You're worrying about needless things! Did you come here to tell me that the ghost of the prince stole the Sa Yin Sword? You used to be as sharp as a sword! Why have you become such a coward? Your Majesty! This is not a joke. Please postpone tomorrow's civil examinations and step up the security in the palace. No. I will not postpone anything because your house was robbed. It's because of your incessant nagging that the construction of my royal villa is taking so long! We have to complete the examinations so that we can complete the construction! - Your Majesty! - You may leave. The prince is dead and the Sa Yin Sword is just a piece of metal. It's finished. Well done. - So you go in there? - Me, me! I'll go in! There's a rope inside. If you pull it, the trapdoor will open. Like this? After you are in, we'll close it. Look, it doesn't show. It's like a coffin. If it doesn't open, you'll die in there. Have you ever seen Yeon Ssi make a mistake? His carpentry is like my lovemaking. The explosives storehouse is being watched, and I've prepared the items you requested. What else do you need? That's it. Now we just have to wait. Hey, Hong Gil Dong! We're just following your orders because we're in desperate times. - But remember that I'm the leader here. If you... - Don't worry. I have no desire to lead a pack of thieves. When it's finished, I'm leaving this place. Really? Then... is that girlfriend of yours going, too? What? You know, that girl with those doe eyes that offered food to me. Wasn't she your girlfriend? - It's not like that. - Indeed? Next time I see her, I'll throw explosives of love into her heart, too. Hey lump, go away before I throw water on your explosives of love. You said she wasn't your girlfriend, and now you're jealous. Stupid girl. I hope she's alright. - You really didn't see Gil Dong? - I said I didn't! After he left to check on his ship ticket, I haven't seen him! Did he take off for China on that ship then? That ship hasn't left yet! And it's the day before the civil examinations, so it's busy here. Don't be a nuisance and go away! You're going to drive me insane! Are you Merchant Wang? That's right. We have lots of items in our store! I heard you know Hong Gil Dong. Do you know his whereabouts? - I don't know Hong Gil Dong! - Are you looking for Gil Dong? You're... you're that young lady from the rain! - Go outside, Granny. - Yes, Young Miss! So you're Hong Gil Dong's friend? A girl being friends with a boy. How interesting. Why is the daughter of the State Councilor looking for Gil Dong? I have to tell him something. Can you help me meet him? - I'm looking for him, too! - So he's still being chased. I wonder if his arm is alright? You know he was hurt? If you see him, tell him I'm sorry I couldn't go with him. Even though it was short, the time that I spent with him... ...was fun. That Gil Dong certainly keeps himself busy even when he's on the run! How did she know he was hurt? He must have gotten hurt while trying to climb a wall to see her! Where were they going together? Were they trying to run away together? Young Miss! Run away with me! Gil Dong! I can't do that! Forgive me! And this... ...was the wall of status and birthright that they could not overcome! Yi Nok! Yi Nok! Don't go looking for Gil Dong! If anyone asks, tell them you don't know who he is! Go outside, Granny. Go outside, Granny. Go outside, Granny. Granny, go outside. Granny, go outside. Go outside, Granny. Granny, go outside. Go outside, Granny! Granny! Granny, go out... Where's Granny? Gil Dong! What's wrong with your hair? Where did you go? I looked everywhere for you! I thought you might be looking for me, so I came here. You haven't eaten yet, right? Eat this. Where did you get this? Did Granny give it to you? Miss Eun Hye gave it to me. Seo Eun Hye? Miss Eun Hye! Miss Eun Hye! I know it's presumptuous of me to do this... I'm taking the exam tomorrow. I came because I thought seeing you would give me courage! Are you confident you will pass? Well... I... I hear that you can hire someone else to take the exam for you. Why didn't you try to do that? - How... how could a scholar do that? - This young nobleman I know did that. I'm different than those men. I will pass with my own efforts! Fine. But if you fail, do not come here again. - Miss Eun Hye! - I have faith in your ability. She said... she's sorry. And... that it was fun. What a strange lady. Gil Dong, where did you ask her to go? Why? Well... if it's someplace important... I can go with you. After all, we're friends! Really? If I ask you to go, will you really go with me? What if it's a scary and dangerous place? Well, we've been to a tiger's den together. I'll go with you! Heo Yi Nok. You don't have to go with me. And don't look for me either. Just... wait. When it's all settled, I'll come to you. - You promise? - Yes. Gil Dong, let's go catch rabbits. I'm hungry! You were bitten by a hungry man. A rabbit's not enough. A boar maybe. Great! Hong Gil Dong, cheer up! I'll take care of my own business, so don't get involved. Did you hear me? You're full and now you're sleepy? Hey, Heo Yi Nok! I'm leaving, so go sleep at Magoksa. I wasn't sleeping. I heard everything! What were you saying? Don't go, Gil Dong, let's talk some more. I said I'll take care of myself. So don't stick your nose in. And you said you weren't sleepy. Stupid girl. If you hang out with me, you'll be in danger. I don't want that to happen, so I won't ask you to go with me. But you know...? When everything's settled... There are tigers in China, too. Shall we go hunting together? Do you want to go with me then? Get up. Time to eat! - Where's Gil Dong? - You're shameless! He carried you here last night and left. He said stay at Magoksa. That's right. He promised he would come back. Let's eat. Now, now! The gates will open now for the civil examinations. Do not push! Enter the palace first with the Sa Yin Sword. When everything is ready, I will reveal the sword and His Majesty's inscription. I will wait with the forces to strike the north gate. When the explosives are ready, they will emit a green smoke. That is your signal to move. But if something goes wrong, a red smoke will be emitted. If that happens, return to Mt. Geom. Now that they've started moving, we, too, will begin. When the gate opens, run quickly and... that guy... go and sit next to him. He's the genius of Kangnam! The competition of seats will be ruthless! Open the gates! There is no way I can see his answers from this seat! - I almost died getting this seat! - Die, die! - Put wood beams over it. - Yes. - Hurry and load it! - Yes, Sir! - Go and get more! - Yes, Sir! His Majesty the King! His Majesty the King! They're here. Here's some nice urine from a mare in heat! Be careful! What's wrong with the horses? We cannot be delayed! Hurry and fix it! The axle is broken! - What's wrong? - We need a cart. I will buy it from you at a good price. Will you sell it to me? We have to work even on the day of the civil examinations! I wonder if my wife and child have starved to death? Why are they making us suffer to build another building in this huge palace? - Stop talking and get back to work! - Let's go back to work! - There will be one more cart coming. - Alright. Everyone, work quickly! To start, it's green. To stop everything, it's red. This is wood for the construction site. Here are our admission papers. Hurry! You have to do mine too! You only paid 100 yang! You'll have to wait! Go away! - Let me see. - Hey, you! That...! Here they come. When the cart goes into the headquarters, get ready. - What's this? They're not going in! - Where are they taking the explosives? Let's follow them. We passed the city gates a long time ago. Why are they going for so long? Wait, wait! This is the palace! - Why are they taking explosives into the palace? - What about Hong Gil Dong? We have to go get him out! - How can we enter the palace? - Oh, that's right. The palace. - They went in. - There is nothing we can do now. Where am I? This is the palace! Who are you? He's trespassing! Seize him! Something's not right. Wait for further instructions! Seize him! Explosives! Get away! Explosions! - That's not the North Gate! - It's the construction site! The explosions will bring guards. Make sure to take away all the weapons! Something has gone wrong. We must leave the palace! It has failed. Return to Mt. Geom! - Your Majesty! - Your Majesty, you must leave! - What is going on? - Escort His Majesty! - Escort His Majesty! - Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Why are you here? You... you...! - Seize him! Seize that man! - Your Majesty! - Seize him! - Let no one leave the hall! Close the palace gates! Your Majesty! That's the culprit! Seize him! This way! Here! Get him! Get on! Hong Gil Dong! You wanted to blow up Yongmun, but the palace blew up instead! Damn it!

It is his fault our plan failed. I have the Sa Yin Sword. Who is it? Tell me! You're my son! Let's end it with me dying. You know how to do it, don't you? - Gil Dong is guilty of treason? - Am I going to die now? Stupid girl. What to do, Heo Yi Nok?! Sorry, I couldn't go with you.
