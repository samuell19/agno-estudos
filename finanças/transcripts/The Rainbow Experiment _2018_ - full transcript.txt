Ah. - Ah. - Yo, J.C., J.C., you and me? Ah. Let's throw it. - Hey, hey, hey. - Ah. Principal Williamson? All right, we'll set up in here. We'll set up in here. Ike Nicholson, Sila Dawson, with SEI. - Oh. - Thank you so much. We can page you if we need you, right? Listen, also, I'd like any files on the investigation you've performed so far, please. Wow, it's like a fuckin' cop show in my own school. Only these guys are Department of Education, partly teachers, partly cops, like all teachers. They're good at asking questions. You answer their questions. You don't give them attitude. That's the whole trick. You don't give them anything. The guy you didn't get to see speak, that's Principal Williamson. He's the top douchebag around here. He runs the place. He's got everything under control. - Nobody's leaving! - Calm down, please. Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Put your gun down. At the time of the flood, they all went into the ark. All of the animals by agreement. It was the only time the creatures of this world ever agreed upon anything. They really all did come. But the Ichthyosaurs didn't. Everybody said he should get on board the ark, but he was very busy just then. Noah himself warned him that the flood was coming, but he quietly said, "I don't believe it." He was universally unpopular when he drowned. Ah yes, they all said the Ichthyosaurus won't be coming. He was the oldest beast of them all. Well-qualified by his great experience, he could say whether something such as a flood was or was not feasible. It's quite possible if a similar situation arises... I shan't get on board either. Excuse me. I arrived at 9:00 a.m. As soon as I got in, I heard their voices. And I heard that there was a fire on the fourth floor lab. So I responded immediately. There was orange powder all over the room. From the fire extinguishers. Mm-hmm. Um... then a student told me another student was on fire, and he was brought to the room across the hall. So, I went to the room, and there was the English teacher, Jamie Freeman, and the school nurse, Mrs... It's, uh, Karen Pitt. - Yeah, Miss Pitt... - Mm-hmm. And they were administering first aid to Matty. He was... His ear was melted off, and there was a hole in his shirt and... Okay. How is, how is Matty? You did well. Thank you. Tell me about Miss Dhawan. I was told she was brought to the faculty room. FDNY asked me to bring her back to room 42. She didn't want to go back in there. I get it. All right. Thank you. - Thank you. - After you. D-H-A-W-A-N. What engine are you guys from? - Engine 11. - All right. All right, take us through what happened. Uh, I set out four beakers. There was a solution of nitrate and water, um, that I prepared the night before. - And how often do you... - And then. Do this experiment? Um, it's, um, it's pretty standard but, um... Um, What happened then? I turned the Bunsen burner on... Are the students wearing any sort of safety equipment for this? I wasn't planning on involving any of the students in the experiment. Huh, plans. That's the thing about plans. They never go the way you think they will. How 'bout yourself? Uh, yes, I had, um, I had safety goggles on, yes. And then you would take and, uh, take the stick and place it over the flame. And a color would shoot out, a different color for each of the different solutions. Then, uh, the students were... they were, they seemed to like the experiment, so they were asking for more colors, more colors. Uh, So I brought four more beakers out that I had prepared also the night before. I'd prepared everything the night before. And, um... same thing, um, but Matty and some of the kids were being disruptive so I asked Matty to come up and... Is that Matty Fairchild? Yes, Matty Fairchild. You asked a disruptive child to come up? He came and stood right here, right next to me. He took one of the sticks... Excuse me, did you have any safety equipment for Matty? No. He took one of the sticks, and he put it over the Bunsen burner, and then there was this huge, like, fireball that came out, like a white flame. I think he let the stick fall. Yeah. Yes. And then it seemed like everything was on fire. And, and then one of the, one of the students brought me one of the fire extinguishers, and I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't... What do you think you're doing? What's going on here? - That's Erin Bennett. - Oh Christ. He's the teacher union rep. He's been coming around here a lot lately. Mainly because of him. He hates his guts. Jess, there's an issue involving an accident with a teacher, teacher's union needs to be here. You guys all should know that. - I didn't know, I'm sorry. - All right, come on, - Lisa, let's go. - You've gotta be kidding? No, I'm not kidding you. Lisa, let's go. You know, thank you, Jess, for letting me know. I appreciate that, all right. Thank you for your time. By the way, forgive me, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Matty, I'm the victim. Yeah. Boo. - What, it's over? - Yeah. That's it? Well, these were the fo... these were the four solvents that you studied, right? - Boo! - The solutions. Well, you wanna... Those are the four that were gonna be on your pop quiz. Don't let me make it worse. More colors. More colors! - Matty, Matty. - More colors, more colors, more colors, more colors! You wanna, you wanna do this one more time? Let's do it two more times! Come on, guys. ♪ I'm a Ryan beast and I'll never stop... ♪ Matty, get off. ♪ I eat like a feast 'cause I'm at the top ♪ Oh! ♪ My name's Matty, you can call me Maury... ♪ Get off the table. ♪ I'm your boy and I only make porns ♪ Get off the table. Matty, Matty, get up here. You're gonna help me with this. Ooooh. Come on, come on. Matty, Matty, Matty... Settle down, settle down. Matty, get up here, come on. - Do it, you're cool. - Over here. Oh, what are you afraid of? All right, come over here. All right, come on. Turn around. - Stay right here. - More colors, more colors. Over here. - Oh. - Oh, come on. I'm a failure, That's me. Come on, Matty. All right, we're gonna do the same thing. We have a different salt solution. Matty's gonna put it over the flame and we're gonna identify what it is. Matty come on, hurry up. Matty, Matty, Matty... Come on, Matty, come on. Matty, Matty, Matty, Matty, Matty, Matty! And you have my sincere apologies. I, I realize that you... Well, ye... yep, yes. Yep, of course. Yes, I... No, of course you almost had a heart attack. Of course, I-I, I do. Okay, okay, goodbye. What did it say? - I need to see what it says. - It, it said... Please, can you pull it up, please. I need to see what it says. There. There was a terrible accident in a classroom, and a student is hospitalized as a result. What did I ask you to do? You wanted me to call an ambulance. You did that? - Yeah, I-I called the ambulance. - Okay, and then? And you wanted me to get Ana and Karen to go with the kids to the hospital, I... And after that. You wanted me to email the parents. The parents, the parents, not all parents! Is it... Do you see how a parent could read that - and think... - Yes, yes, yes. That it's their child? Are... - I do, yes, sorry. - I-I don't need you, I don't need you to be sorry. I need you to not make mistakes like this, because this is not the first time. Excuse me, do you know where is Robert Coles High School? What school? Robert Coles. Excuse me. That's Toni. What? I'd have done anything for her. Pot, pills, you name it. But for that, she had Adam. Just, um, don't take them together, okay? Thanks. How are you feeling? There's just so much going on. I don't even, I don't know. Well, you want some? - Yeah. - To help you out. Dad, what're you doing here? What is this? Who is this? Hey, who is that? Hey, yo, who are you? Who is it? Is that a teacher? - No, it... - Is that a teacher? - It... He's my friend. - Is he a teacher here? No, no, no, he's not a teacher. What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at the clinic? I-I took... I, um, there's a big meeting today. All the parents have to be there. Mom's gonna be there. I'm-I'm dealing with your mother, but just tell me what happened, what... Deal with her? That's what you say every time, and then you start shouting at each other. All right, that's... It, it'll be fine. Tell me what happened. Did you know this kid? Is he a friend of yours? Yes. I'm, I'm sorry. - You okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Come on, you can talk to me, you know that. What's wrong? What's wrong? Mom told me that you started drinking again. I'm sorry. No, I, uh, I-I took... What, what, what... What was that? What did he give you? - It's just Tylenol, - No. I had a headache. This isn't Tylenol. Dad, I gotta go. I told you. - Dad, no. I have to go. - No. - I have to go to class. - Toni, listen, Please just talk to me. Just, just talk to me. There's a passage I got memorized that seems appropriate for the situation. The world you see is just a movie in your mind. Nobody understands it. Nobody listens. They're all running around like chickens with heads cut off. - Hey. - Hey! It's not your fault. What's not my fault? - What's wrong? - Yesterday. Yeah, I know. Look, I gotta put these trays out. You're a flirt. I can't help it. You're lucky I love you. Hi. I'm Ross. They told me that you have - something for me. - Oh hi, I'm Anna. Hi. Excuse me. Do you know where is Robert Coles High School? I've never heard of it. I know how hard this is. I get it. So I'll just take his things right, and, uh... How the fuck do you get it? What, what, what makes you think you get it? You get it, you really get what the fuck is going on with me right now? Is that what they tell you to say? They tell you to say, oh, the father's gonna come in, just to make him feel like you know what he's going through right now. Just make him feel like, uh, everything's gonna be fine. His face is, like, gone. It's... He's not... Was he scared? I don't know. Did he say any, he didn't say anything? No, but he sq... he definitely squeezed my hand. I could feel him. He was there. You don't know what happened at all, huh? I'm so sorry. Here you go. I can't, I can't. I'm like, oh, I can't let that happen. Good morning. How we doing today? Who, Tomas? Yeah, 'cause it's all... I know yesterday was a really, uh, was a really... rough day for everyone, okay. But I'm happy to see your faces. I think it's good for us to be together. Ah, Miss Green. She knows her shit, and she always casts me as the lead in her plays. I mean, I was right next to him. I literally saw it hit him. It was, it was like a fireball. I didn't know what to do. It was, it was terrifying. Alex is always right next to me. He's a real go-getter. Half Italian, half Cuban. He wants to be an actor. He wants to be me. He's the understudy. Like one second, everything was fine, and then the next second, there was just chaos. It-it, I mean, it just happened, you know, and... That's Rod. He wants to be deep. There is no why. It just did. Paul. Only Chris knows Paul. You think she, like, mixed up the chemicals - or something the second time? - I don't know, She didn't mix up the chemicals. So then why would it be, why would it be different? Julia. She's captain of the volleyball team. She's a member of the Chinese and National Honor Society, and she's been playing violin for ten years. One day she'll be president of the United States, you mark my words. How come it didn't happen to her? I don't know. It was just an accident, guys. And Karla. I wish I had an answer, I don't... Joe. It couldn't have just happened like if he dropped the stick in or something... And Kid. Kid loves his music more than words. And Toni more than his music. - Well, I mean... - Could it, I mean... It happened when he, when he held it out. No, he held it out. That's how it happened. I saw it. He didn't drop it. As soon as he pulled it up, that's when it happened. However, she's still responsible. This is, this was her class, you know. How 'bout you, J.C.? What do you... do you have anything to say? Whatever. Whatever? Matty was your best friend. Is your best friend. J.C.'s a good guy. He looks tough and like he doesn't care, but he does. And he always feels guilty. He feels guilty when his dad beats the shit out of him. He feels guilty that he didn't stop me that day, or any day, really. J.C. can never stop me from doin' shit. How 'bout you, Lawrence? I-I have to, I have to think. You have to think? I have to think. I can't speak. Smart ass Lawrence. You can't overlook Lawrence. I saw my best friend go up in flames, so you're gonna ask me how I feel? You're really asking me how I'm affected by my friend's death? He's not dead! He can die. He can die! - He can die... - He's not dead though! The whole point of this is to talk about our feelings, not to blame people. Well, maybe if Lawrence would stop blaming people all the time, acting like he's better than us! Better than you, okay. I am not better than you... Yeah, you're not, shut up! - Calm down, - Lawrence, I see your point. His life as he knew it is, is not gonna be the same. I know what you all think, right, that it, it could've been you, right. You were all in the class, you were all doing the experiment. You all think it could've been you, right? Yeah. Toni, are you okay? She's not okay. Hey, I just, I don't really wanna talk about this, okay? I'm sorry. We were just in front of a fire. We just saw our friend get burnt in a fire. I-I was, I was in a panic. You know, the right word is shock. A lot of people are shocked under surprise circumstances. It's common for a person to be shocked when a child under their supervision is suddenly on fire. I mean, in your opinion then, did Miss Dhawan do anything out of the ordinary or was it by the book? Eh, I mean, she could've set it up differently, sure. How? Jason Phillips. The bad ass amongst teachers. When I grow up, I wanna be just like him. He knows everything, and he can do anything better than everybody else. Because methanol has a very low boiling point any spark can, can set it off. As far as we know though, Miss Dhawan didn't use any methanol. Well, I can't imagine anything else reacting the way that it did. But I, I could be wrong. He's never wrong. I can't, I can't say that I... I can't say that it wasn't working. I don't know. I don't remember. Okay, do you remember saying, "I burned a kid," or "Oh, my God, I set a kid on fire?" It could have happened to anyone. Goggles, if there's an explosion and flame, goggles aren't really gonna do much of anything against a fire, although I'm sure after all the VOs and the NOVs, everything will be brought up to standard. Little late for Matty, don't you think? Phew! Someone's head is gonna roll over this. That could be yours, could be someone else's. Any experiment is dangerous. Right. So, how can we do our jobs if we don't do these experiments? I mean, it's like gym class. Gym class is dangerous. You know, we can't do our jobs if... We can't do any experiments. I mean, I mean, how much chemistry do you guys know? I know enough to know that kids don't usually burst into flame during gym class. Look, something happened, you know. Accidents happen. Would you say that this is Miss Dhawan's fault? That, that this accident occurred because she was not careful? Tha... look, I... If she... You're not on trial. I know, but I feel... Look, this is a fellow teacher. I mean, it's one of my students. It's really hard. I don't know how she's gonna live with herself, all right. I don't know how she's gonna be able to get through her days. I mean, you make a mistake like this - All right. - It's not easy to be a teacher these days, okay. Yes, all right. Thank you, Mr. Phillips. We'll be in... Will you be in later in case we have questions, or... Yeah, sure. - Okay, thanks. - Thank you. It's not easy to be a teacher, my ass. Why is it not easy to be a teacher? You just have to tell us what the fuck to do. And we're all the same, makes us easier to teach. Teaches us to be just like them. Eat, sleep, make money for someone else, and die. Eat, sleep, make money for someone else, and die! Hi. I have to go to the hospital, so I wanted to... I didn't know what to do with this, so... - Yeah, sure. - Figured I'd put it, I didn't really know that he was, um... I didn't know he was so into art. It's really beautiful, isn't it? Yeah, I guess. I don't know, I don't know what it... I don't know what it is? What is it? Ah, come on. It's pretty obvious isn't it? Mr. Prasec says it's not art unless it has the potential to be a disaster. It looks like kinda burnt here. - He didn't get... - Everybody was supposed to do this? Was he working on, like, a tree, uh, a tree thing? He's really into, like, myths and symbols. We talked about it a lot actually. You and him talked about it a lot? A really special kid. Yeah, that's Matty. Yeah. You must've seen him in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He was really good in that. I, uh, no, I cou... You know, I couldn't actually, unfortunately was not able to see him in that. - I work a lot, um, nights. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, lots of long hours... - He was really good. - I heard he was really good. - Yeah. How is Matty? I'm going to actually take this. Oh, sure. If that's... Thanks. That ticker tape, oh, just flick, flick it that way. It's got those spikes. Good morning everyone. Can I have your attention, please. As you are all aware, Miss Dhawan is on a leave of absence. While she is away, we have secured a substitute. Her name is Alis Willmore. If you'd like to maybe introduce yourselves to her, uh, that would be a great way to start this meeting. Hi, I'm Anna. Hi, Anna. Nice to meet you. Oh, yeah. Nice to meet you. Anna's the school counselor. I'm the school counselor, yeah. Oh, great. John Peters, security. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, Peter, I'm new here, I'm actually teaching American History. Oh, great. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Jamie Freeman. English. Welcome. Thank you. - Oh, this is, uh... - Tomas. Uh, Tomas, he's the art teacher. - Oh, hi. - Hi. I'm Alis. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I'm Karen, the school nurse. - Hi. - Hi, would you like a cookie? Oh, I'm okay, thank you. I'll have a cookie. Okay, everyone is welcome to cookies. Not all at once. How you doing, Coach Randall, Phys Ed. I'm Adam, uh, teaching a dead language to kids with no attention span. - It's an uphill battle. - Nice. You in the union? - I'm sorry? - Are you in the union? Um, no. Jason Phillips, also science. She's not. - I'm, I mean I can join... - Figures. If that's... - Oh, my God, lighten up! - That's not the point. Yeah, I'll take this in stride. - Of all days, of all days. - All right, no problem. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Your job's not on the line. - Thank you again. Again, I appreciate you welcoming Miss Willmore. - Thanks, Jess. - That's the second course. - I'm having trouble... - Thanks. Got your class list here. You might wanna go through these kids. There's some goodies and some baddies. Alex Imparato, he's a nice kid. Tom Smith is, uh, so-so. In this street? This street, thanks. Thanks. Happy new year. Uh, Karla Smart is anything but. Uh, Joe's nice, and Toni McKenna's nice. Ray, just stay away from Ray at all costs. You know, avoid him in the hallways. No, he's all right, he's all right. Meghan, uh, is a beautiful girl. This is helpful. - Okay. - What? No, this is the faculty room, - we can say whatever we want. - I know. Let me find the Tylenol. Oh, geez, just take three, or how many, four is good. You can change it, you can change it. Hey, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I've got the big meeting coming up. I've gotta clear everything out. Oh, sure, yeah. I'm done anyway. Oh, yeah? You okay? Yeah. What you drinking there, something strong? What is it, tea? Tea. Love tea. Are you... I mean, you have an English accent. Oh, right. Well. I am, uh... I am from London. I moved over a few years ago. And you? Oh, I've never, I've never been to London, no. That's not really what I meant. Well, I don't know. Yeah, we can, sure. - We can? - Get a coffee, you know, it's all good. Isn't that, you've been... - No, I'm... - staring at me, I was... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My mistake. You have a good, um... - You have a good afternoon. - It was just... It was just a misunderstanding. Okay. - Do you got enough? - Yeah, thanks. - Yeah? - Yeah. All right, um, great. You helped out that kid yesterday, right? How's he doin'? Is... is he gonna make it, or... Um... I don't know. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be fine, you know. No, it's not. That's just something that people say. Like, that they don't mean it, do they, right? I really don't understand why, like, everything... Nothing, nothing's gonna be okay, right. I mean, nothing's gonna be okay for the kid. Nothing's gonna be okay for his family. Nothing's gonna be okay for me. I'm tired of people saying things are gonna be all right. I don't like having, living in this place where we're not really relating, do you know what I'm saying? Everyone's talking to each other, and they're trying to talk to each other, but they're not really talking to each other. I don't wanna do anything that's superficial stuff with people, tell me everything's gonna be all right, people change. People don't fucking change! - Yeah, they do change. - No, they don't! - People change. - They just stay the same. You have to accept them or just... Why would you just say that to me when you don't even know, right? Why would you say that... I could've done something different when I don't... I think that I couldn't have done something different, and I'm sorry that I didn't, and I tried to do it, and that's the only thing that I can go on at this point. I tried to do what I... I tried to do what I could, and that was all I could do at that moment. Not, not now. Not now. Sorry. That was a lot in a short amount of time. You're good to go. I'm right down the, right down the hall. If you need anything, you can interrupt my class at any time. I would welcome that. Good to know. What are you doing here? And why aren't you in Chicago? Hello, I'm lookin' for, uh, the principal, Jefferson, No Williamson, Jessie Williamson. Principal Williamson? Yes. Uh, hi, I'm Sebastian Summer. I'm the guy that they sent from Central. - We talked on the phone. - Oh, right, yes, Sebastian. - Oh, you remembered me? - Yes, on the phone. Right. - That makes me feel so good. - Yes, please. I'm not much, but I'm all I think about. How you doin', man? I've been better. I know. Here, let's shake hands again. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Have a seat, please. This ain't gonna work. - Okay. - So I have a solution. I don't like any of the chairs in, in our system. They're all sort of built to encourage too much comfort. You know, my philosophy is not too tight, not too loose. So I'm gonna sit on my yoga mat. - Okay. - Okay, Don't worry. It's not a big deal. Oh, that. Does that sound more like Jingle Bells, or does it sound more like a technique for raising ghosts up from, like, an underworld ghost river? Uh... - the ghost river? - Yes baby, that's what I'm talkin' about. I live pretty far away. Uh, last stop on the 3 train. - It's a trek. - Wow, that's really far. Yeah, I get to school late most of the time. I try to get on time, but I'm not motivated to come to school but, you know, who is? - Sure, like, you're not even... - You're not motivated? - Yes. - Who are you? I... - Who are you looking for? - Where's Jess? - Jess? - Uh, he's the principal. Who are you? He, um... Uh, he moved down the hall, another office for today. Why'd he move down the hall? He, he's just been temporarily relocated. Why are you sitting in his chair? That's where the principal sits. Well, Jess is still the principal. He's in a temporary location. I expect that the, uh, secretary or maybe security could direct you to his... present location. I study Shamanism. Don't worry. I'm not here to, you know, do any magic or anything. You're un... you're unzipped. Just, sorry. That's okay. Thank you. Thank... Good lookin' out as they say. All right, this is my Grateful Dead tie. The Grateful Dead tie is for one kinda conversation, and this is my Thunderbird tie. I didn't know what kinda conversation we were gonna have, but I can tell this is gonna be more of a Thunderbird conversation, - so that's, that's good. - Yeah, I think so. Don't worry about me. I'm here for one reason and one reason only. I've been a principal for six years. The superintendent called me up, the chancellor called me up. Okay? These people know me well. I'm only here for one thing, and that is to get your back. I'm a brother principal, baby. - Great. - What's happening? - Oh, Miss Williamson. - Who are those people in Jess' office? Um, oh, we, we had an accident. Those are the investigators... Did Jess do something wrong? - No, no, no, no. - Is he okay? No, he didn't do... They, they just have, they have to do a report, that's all. You have the parents coming at what time? - Three. - Three? Yeah, yeah. They're all coming. All right, so we have some time. Here's what I wanna say to you. Ninety percent of what's goin' on with the kids isn't about the kids, it's what adults are projecting on the kids, okay? Parents in America who feel that their children are entitled to all kinds of things, whether it's private or public or whatever, okay? Children themselves that think that they should be getting everything they want when they want it. And if they don't get it, it's somebody's fault. How do your parents feel about you being late to school every day? They don't care. I get good grades, so they don't really bother me too much. 'Cause you're top of the class. Top of the school. Top of the school. Do you do well in Miss Dhawan's class? Yeah, it's not much work. Okay, so you're the brain, J.C. tries, Matty's the clown, Matty's the actor, - Matty's the... He's the leader. - No, no. He's the... I mean like, we're all pretty much leaders. You're in New York City, public education, 1.1 million kids, in America, at a time when public education is under attack. You're living at a time when the country's in total upheaval, and you're a principal in the very midst of it. You're a warrior. Why did he have to leave his office? Why don't you sit down? Is it nice where they have him? Like, is it... I guess so. I mean, he's the principal, so... Yeah, he's the principal. I-I got a kid who's in the ICU, burns over half of his body. I've got SEI talking to everybody in this school. I've got a thousand parents coming that got an email that said a kid had been burned. So they all think it could be theirs. Now, I've gotta meet them in an hour and a half and let them know what happened. Even if it's not their kid, which they know by now, they know that something could easily happen in this school that could get their kid in the hospital. All right, are you worried that they might just throw - your ass out on the corner? - Yeah, absolutely, yes. Okay. I failed. I... What if they fire me? Well, she's so insecure, you know. Do you get the feeling she wants the students to like her? Yeah, I mean, she does it all wrong, you know. Like, you don't say, this is fun, guys, you know, before you do a fun experiment, you know. She's not cool. No, she's not cool. They don't fire you over something like this. Yeah, there you go. Sit up. Shit. You can't be lookin' like some guy who's been completely deflated. Matter of fact... let's change seats. Maybe I should sit on the yoga mat. Come on, baby. Let's switch. Your husband, he's, um... No, no, no. He's really not my husband technically. I mean, the divorce isn't final, but he probably wouldn't like it if... Okay, well, would you like to sit down? Okay. Can I get you anything? Thank you, yes. Water. Yeah, yeah. Uh, one sec. Has the UFT been in touch? Yeah. Okay, what's their problem? Lots of things. Ever since the evaluations, they've been up my ass. Yeah, I heard about that. How'd that go for you? You introduced your own teacher evaluation at a time when teachers are getting tons of evaluations rained down upon them like drone strikes. All right, maybe it wasn't the best idea, I don't know. Hey, it's an innocent, honest mistake. Don't ever do that again. I just don't think I have them on my side right now, so... You don't have them on your side. You know what? Join the club. Public education, man. It's nobody's fault and everybody's responsibility. And everybody's gonna be happy, joyful, and free as long as everybody covers their ass. Now, did you look at her curriculum? Yes, of course I looked at her curriculum. Did you look at her lesson plans? Yes, I looked at her lesson plans. Are you in a relationship with this teacher? Absolutely not! Okay, then you have nothing - to worry about. - She was getting harassed by students though. I called them in... as you do. One of the kids was Matty Fairchild. That's dicey. He had a little weird thing with Miss D. What? - Miss D? - Yeah. Yeah, is that what you guys... Miss Dhawan. Yeah, yeah. Th-Th-That's... that's what, that's what, that's what we call her. Matty was who called her that. It sounds like a, - it's like a nickname. - Yeah, I mean, he didn't like her very much. Any particular reason? No, I mean, he was always upset at her because of... her getting a friend of mine into trouble. She, she talked about J.C. Is this another... - Another student. - Classmate, okay. Yeah. It's a good friend of ours. Talked about him getting in trouble with his dad, and that was not cool, you know. - J.C. got in trouble... - He didn't want them - to know, man! - with his dad. - What the fuck? - His dad, yeah. And Miss Dhawan talked about it? - Yeah, um... - And that's a problem because? You don't wanna get in trouble with J.C.'s dad. Is he violent? Oh, like, you know. And Miss Dhawan brought it up to the school? Yeah, I mean, she sort of noticed the... the... we sort of all, yeah. When was this? You have to move your sits bones. Move, move your butt cheeks so that you are on your sits bones. This is where we constantly screw up in meditation as well. You need to be sitting so that you can, you know, hold your seat, be uplifted. Take a nice breath. Not too tight, not too loose. Breathing in... I absorb all the deep, dark, ugly, black shit that's about to happen from the parents. Breathing out... I let it all go. Breathing in... I take in all the deep, dark, black, oily, thick shit from the parents. Breathing out... I let it go. That look on your face is a little scary. Try to relax your face muscles. Yes, relax. Look at those wrinkles disappear. Ah, you look five years younger. That easy, huh? Now, you were left alone to handle all of that by yourself... you might, you might make a mistake. I'm here to make sure that you are good on that. You know what you need to do? You need to be out there talkin' to your custodians. 'Cause if lights go out like that, that's some shit. You know? I don't know what's happening in this school. - You're in charge... - Jess. Of the custodians. Amy. Oh, my God, what? I woke up and you weren't there and then I came here and then... - Hello. - they told me they wanted me to wait, but it wasn't even your office. - This isn't your office. - Wait, what happened? - Wait, wait, Amy. - Babe, I'm so sorry. - Jesus Christ. - Amy, what are you doing here? Sorry that this is your office. Amy, what happened? What... Are you in trouble? In a minute, he'll be gone, okay? - And this office is... - Hey, uh, Jess. Is it all right if I just leave my stuff here? Yeah, of course, of course. - Hello there. - Just, could you just - sit down for me. - She said they called, - called you my husband. - Sit down, just come. I'll give you some privacy. Don't worry. Everything's all right. I gotta take my shoes. Otherwise, somebody's gonna look at me like I'm crazy.

Uh, well, I don't really like to call it that. You help people. Oh, I try to. That's the goal. I wanna help people too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Working in the cafeteria? Yeah, right. I just do that to save up to go to school to be like you. I knew Matty. How's he doin'? He wanted to be an actor. - He did? - Yeah. He, uh, was friends with, um, Adam, who works with me in the cafeteria. Um, he goes to acting school, so they kinda hit it off, and they had, like, their own thing. 'Cause you know how actors are. They have like their... And they're just, um... Adam actually... well, he gave, um... I gotta go back to work, so... You, you're not gonna wake... Olga, lis-listen to me. Please, just listen to me for a second. - I know that this is hard... - Ross. But we really need to go in there, and we really need some answers right now. - Ross. - Okay? - Olga, please. - We need to be with our son. - I know we need to... I know. - We need... - Don't you wanna know? - something that... - I just, they're running late... - Why? Why? Do you think we're gonna figure out why tonight? Do you think we're gonna figure out why anything? Amy, we can't do this right now. I gotta go to this meeting. - I have to be there. - I know, but I wanna just tell you that I, I just, I can't be alone right now. Jess, I can't do it. Can I help you find anything? Are you the librarian too? Why is he at that school in the first place? I wanted to send him to Fieldston. Why is he there? Where have you been? When it's time to do the homework, - where have you been? - I've... what do you mean? I've been at work. I've been busy. Would you... don't... Can we, can we... Are you really You're gonna blame, you're gonna put all the blame on me now. I'm so sorry. I made a mistake. I'm so sorry. How did we end up here? I could've just... How did we end up here? How did we end up with Matty? - I could've just... - Are we really gonna do this right now? - You didn't even wanna have... - Twenty minutes, can you ple... You didn't even wanna have him! You didn't even wanna have him. Get the fuck outta here? Are we really gonna have this conversation right now? I was a kid. I was Matty's age. I was a kid. I was young too. We made this decision together. I was young too. Don't yell at me. Don't yell on the street. I'll fucking yell on the street if I wanna yell on the fuckin' street. Don't yell at me. Don't you yell at me. Are you married? What's your... - Uh, no, I'm not. - Oh, okay. What happened? Why not? Um, I don't know. I've just had really bad luck with men. Really? I was Matty's age when we had this discussion. You think I wanted to have a kid - when I was that... - I was young too. My mom and my dad, I love 'em both. They made me. I just wish they would've never stayed together. They stayed together because of me, but that was stupid because I would have preferred nothing more than them being apart. When I was younger, I used to pray that they got divorced. Matty's the best fucking thing in my life, Olga. Oh, I don't wanna yell. I don't wanna yell! Then I guess I got used to it, or I stopped praying. I don't wanna yell either, okay. - I still love you. - What about you? Do you still love me? Uh, I have uh, two kids. Good to know. I wish I could go back in time and have a different outcome. - I would have never... - I meant, are you married? Oh, oh, yeah. - You are? - Yes. - Yes, yes. - Oh. - Okay. - Yes, I am. Um... well, yeah. Well, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't see a ring, so... Yeah, well, I... I don't believe in rings. They're confining... and I suffer from claustrophobia. Oh, I'm sorry. Hello? The world you see is just a movie in your mind. The world you see is just a movie in your mind. The world you see is just a movie in your mind. The world you see is just a movie in your mind. Let's make sure the custodian set it up and then the, the papers for the parents, and where do those go? Like maybe on a table outside. - Okay, all right. - Parents can pick 'em up as they walk in. And when does that have to happen? Like, in 15 minutes. Oh, okay, so I better go do that. - Thank you. - Sure. - I'm sorry. - It's no problem, Jess. Hello. Hello. My name is Nick Kazantzoglou, and I would like to see the headmaster, please. Do you have an appointment? No, but... Kazantzoglou, K-A-Z-A-N-T-Z-O-G-L-O-U. You need to have an appointment to see the principal. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, the gentleman is with me. Um, I'm a parent, and, uh, my name is David McKenna, and, uh, I got an email about a meeting, uh, with the principal. The meeting's in the afternoon. Well, uh, well, we're, we're early, but we can, we can wait if, if... - McKenna? - Yeah. Can you give me one second? Yeah, sure. The gentleman is with me. You sure know how to do things. Um... I'm sorry. Uh, I can't, I can't let you in. You're on a list of people I can't let in. Wait, what do you mean you can't? I'm, I'm a parent. - I understand. - David McKenna. I understand. I don't know why you're on the list, but you're gonna have to talk to the principal about that. Well, I'm here to talk to the principal, So if you can go get the principal... The principal's not here - right now, sir. - I'll talk to him right now. I wanna see the list. I can't show you the list, sir. I wanna see the list. Show me the list. I can't show you... - Sir, you're gonna have to... - Show me the list. I can't show you the list, sir. Sir, you're gonna have to calm down. I wanna see the fucking principal right now. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Where are you going, sir? - You're not going. - [Joh Sir! Calm down. Calm down. Sir, I'm gonna have to call this in - if you don't leave. - Call whoever you want! I'm a parent here! Okay, okay, okay. Fucking restraining order on me! Ah! I can't... She put me on a fucking list! You know what? I'm gonna go back in there... No, no. No, don't. She... My fucking bitch ex-wife just did this. She put me on a fucking list. She put me on a fucking restraining order! I'm not gonna be able to see my daughter. I'm... It's okay. Calm down. I know another way, okay. You look like shit, you know that? I got fired. Okay? I got fired. I lost my fucking insurance. I'm gonna lose my apartment. You know, you're raising a kid and you got a reason to get up in the morning, that's what you do. You get up in the morning. That's, that's what you do. You know? That's what you do. You got a kid, right, so you get up for the kid. Then you don't have a reason to get up. And that... I'm gonna go back in there. - No, no, no. - I'm gonna go back in there. You made her a nervous wreck, you know that. I know Miss Dhawan had some issues. I am aware. You were one of the biggest issues she had, Jess. Because she didn't come to me. I think you've cultivated a, a culture of fear, - a toxic culture here. - Are you making a direct connection between the accident and the evaluations? And what if I am? Are you just gonna deflect it? Or are you gonna actually refute it in some way? You know you made her a nervous wreck. Refute? I'm not gonna refute your spurious accusations. Guys, are we not all being evaluated anonymously by students? Is that maybe a little unethical if he never asked us about it? You've brought it to the teacher's union, why don't you leave it at that instead of bringing it into this room and making it everyone's business. It is everyone's business! It is everyone's business if we're being snitched on by students at your behest. I would sincerely appreciate your support. There are a thousand kids in this school. Of course, you don't get what I'm saying. Most of them are still here. And we have to continue to educate them. - You think about education. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Education is what they're here for? Is it what you're here for? Give me a break. Empower us, 'cause we're the ones who care about the education. Not the parents, not the students. You just want to get better grades and get them into better colleges, so when we give them a B, they come after us. If you don't feel like you wanna come to this meeting, I understand, and you are excused. All you're doing is deflecting, Jess. Would you keep your voice down? You, shut up! Whoa, Jason, let's... I think you're here to make a name for yourself. - You wanna clean up the school. - I think you need to leave. I need to leave? I think you need to leave right now. It's not us against them. We're all trying to work it out, together, okay? Get that in your brain. Instead of this. Give me a break, Jamie. Give me a break. There's no need to insult... - I think it's pretty insulting. - fellow staff members. I think it's pretty insulting that she's coming in here lecturing me and treating me like an idiot when I've been a teacher - for seven years, and she has... - She's trying to give you a different perspective. The problem is, you and him have made the kids feel like they're the adults in the room, like they should have the authority. Why are you so angry? Because you're an idiot... and you're questioning me - like I'm an idiot. - Whoa, whoa, Jason, just... I'm the school counselor, - I'm a psychologist. - Yeah, I know you want this - petri dish to be... - So I get a lot more shit - than you do. - your own psych ward. I get that. You know, there are other places to teach. What? There are other places to teach. Are you kidding? You want solidarity? Stop coming after teachers. When was the last time you were in a classroom? When was the last time you sat in on anybody's classroom? That's what I thought. What are you doin'? - What are you doin'? - I'm thanking him. God? Yeah, God, for leaving the door open for us. Oh, shit. Shit. You, uh, you gonna take your thanks back? No. What the fuck is that? What're you doin'? I'm praying. To the lock? What language is that? Arabic. - Arabic? - Shh. Isn't that a different religion than before? Does the religion matter? Do you have just, like, a different religion - for every situation or... - No. Let's smoke. Let's smoke. There is no smoking inside. Fucking America. Come on. Why do you have a gun? I wanna know why you have a gun. - Why? - Because, what are you, - a criminal or something? - Why do you want to know? Are you a criminal or something? Do I look like a criminal? Yes, yes, you look like a fuckin' criminal. And I'm not lettin' you in here with a gun! We're in America, Davy. We're in America. It's the easiest thing in the world, having a gun in America. Bullshit, why do you have a gun? I owe money to the wrong people, that's why. Aye, uh, I gotta be out of my fucking mind. Uh, yeah, um, I'm just calling to confirm my appointment for this evening. Uh, yeah. Willmore, Alis. Mm-hmm. Thank you. You must think I'm an asshole. No. It's too scary to stand up the way you did, you know. Not everyone... can do that. Can I buy you a cup of coffee? Just to prove I'm not a monster. Um... I'm not married. I'm, I'm sorry. That was so stupid. I'm sorry, uh, I am... Coffee sounds good. Yeah? Will you just please just stop talking bullshit to me. You don't believe in any of that. No, I believe in facts and logic. Logic. How about numbers? Yeah, numbers, numbers are good. Numbers are good. How about 9-11? - 9-11? - Yeah. The day the American dream died. Where I come from, 9-11 means the ninth of November. Only Americans read backwards. 9-11, 1989. It was the middle of the night when the wall came down. You know that, huh? No, I was 11. I don't know that. You were 11. You were 11. Do you see that? 9-11, you were 11. Okay, okay, okay. Big party day. November 9th, I was in Berlin. Everyone is out on the road, celebrating that they got capitalism, freedom. And people still thought that freedom is to buy stuff. Bananas everywhere, they didn't have bananas. Behind the wall, there were no bananas, so when they came to freedom, they were rewarded with... bananas. You know what November 9th was up until the big party day? It was called The Night of Broken Glass, November 9, 1938. That was the same day as, be careful, when the wall came down. My point is, a bad day became a good day, just like that. You don't believe in any of that? No, I believe in facts and logic. Facts... Are you okay? - Yeah. - This is a fact. This is logic. Okay. Wow. Parents are a thing of the past, don't you think? Wow. There's so many people here. And they're all so pissed. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon. - I guess I'd be angry too. - Can everyone please take a seat. You know, it could be any one of their kids. Thank you, thank you. That's just another reason not to have them. Look, the sooner we get started, the more information you get from us, thank you. All right, I'm, I'm Principal Williamson. We appreciate you being here more than you know. Uh, I sincerely apologize for the way you were notified. We're gonna get started today with a report from our school safety officer, Officer Genet. Hello, everyone, thank you for your attention. I am Officer Genet of the NYPD and head of security here at Coles. - Alis. - We understand that this is a very difficult time... Sittin' here by your lonesome, huh? - Oh... - Did I miss everything? Has issued notices of violations to the institution. An NOV will list violations and must be corrected within 35 days. - Oh, come on. - It is the responsibility of the NYPD, the FDNY, Coles... Oh, hey, Jack. - How are you, buddy. - It's Jason. Parents to make a serious commitment towards all of this compliance. - At this time, - That's my seat. That's all I have for you, I will now turn the meeting - back over to... - And that's my coffee too. Oh, that's your coffee, okay. - Yeah. - Okay, great. - Talk to you later. - Okay. Thank you, Officer Genet. We will be working very closely with her in the coming weeks regarding all of the violations that she mentioned. - Hi. - Hey, um... How's it goin' up there? Um, it's, it's loud. Um, have, have you... have you seen the principal's wife? Yeah, she came in earlier today. No, I mean, like a couple minutes ago. Have you seen her? Did she go by here? Uh, I don't, I don't think so. I mean, I had to go the bathroom, I mean. I'm sorry. I fell asleep. You know, I have that condition, um, insomnia condition, since Afghanistan. All right, um... Can I, can I come in there? Just for a second. Yeah. I was supposed to keep an eye on her and stay with her and make sure she didn't leave my sight, and I messed that up and now she's gone. I have no idea what I'm gonna say, like I don't know. She's an adult. But that... Okay, the meeting that's going on upstairs is because I sent out an email, I was supposed to send it to, like, a few people, and I sent it to everybody. Because I just can't, apparently just can't do anything. - Okay, okay. - Right? Hey. I'm living upstairs right now. I'm sleeping upstairs, and I, I can't, I can't keep an eye on the principal's wife for five minutes. I'm not paying my rent. I'm not... I have a question. Why are our kids being investigated without us or our lawyers being present? So a parent says, wady-bomby-domby-domby-dah. And you're gonna say. Until we let this process take its course, there's really nothing more I can share with you. I don't understand. What does that mean? They're only gonna respect you more as a result of this, I guarantee you. - Teacher was wearing goggles... - There's a process... but none of the students were? Is it true? Yes, that is true. - How is that possible? - Oh, my God. Are there no safety regulations? Yes, there are safety regulations. The science teacher made a choice, an unfortunate choice in this instance. - That's ridiculous. - But really she's not obliged - to, to, make students... - No, that's crazy. And what about the the chemicals themselves - I heard that it was broken. - Obviously, something got a little out of control in this case. Frankly, it's also a matter of budget. You should've told me. I would've got you safety goggles. There's a child in the hospital right now, and you're talking about budget? So the kids get to not wear safety goggles. You got some stones, man. Can we have less questions in the room, please. - You're not the only one here. - That is not... Oh, so you get to decide how this meeting goes? That's really self-centered. I'm self-centered? - We almost had a heart attack. - I'm self-centered? Are you fucking serious? He was crying. He was, he was hurting. And I was just doing everything I could to help him, you know. Yeah, we know you did everything you could. I really tried. I used everything that I knew. I know. Did he say anything? Um... yeah. Well, he was saying a lot of things and um, a couple things. But there's one thing in particular that he was saying, but I don't, I don't know if it would... make sense to you, like it's, you know, people say things when they're - in shock so... - Mm-hmm, what did he say? Um... he said I would rather pick up dog shit than stay with him. I had heard J.C. and him fighting earlier that day, and he was screaming at him, I'd rather pick up dog shit than stay with him. I'd rather pick up dog shit than stay with him. - Did you... - It sounds weird, right? It doesn't make sense. The only other thing that he was saying, and I don't know if it was in reference to this or not, but he was saying it was a joke. - A joke? - It was a joke, it was a joke. He was like, ah, joke, it was a joke. And like, he was... Any idea? No. I didn't know. I mean, it was just a sight to see him, you know, he's, you know he is a good kid, right? He's such a good kid. I liked him a lot. He was always really nice to me and really sweet to me. Okay, just, um... Thank you. You know, he's lucky you responded so quickly. Do you really think so? I know so. I tried so hard. I know. It's okay, okay. Let's... We're done. - Okay. - This is great. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. You were really helpful. Thank you. - It was a pleasure... - Thank you for coming down. To meet you. Yeah, excuse me. Can you get yourself together and... Do you want some water or something? All right, I'll take you to see your counselor, and it'll be okay, all right? - Natalie... - Hi, I've got to get her to her counselor. - All right. - Come on, sweetie. Let's go. - J.C. - I gotta use the bathroom. - The principal's office? - Yes. Um, it was there two days ago, but... - they moved it down the hall. - What happened to your eye? What? What happened? You all right? Yeah, I'm good, I'm good. Don't worry about it. Uh, two things, actually. Uh, one, that there were trace amounts of methanol on all the beakers. But also that they were varying degrees. What the hell? She said she didn't use methanol. - But there was methanol? - There was. There was an accident up there yesterday. Kid got burned really bad. He died? He's in a coma. - Poor teacher. - Poor teacher? Yeah, she fucked up. Poor teacher. What do you mean he wasn't supposed to be there? He wasn't supposed to be up there. He was called up by her. What was the disruption in class that she had to call Matty up front for? Were you guys just... I actually, I'm not too sure, we were just talking. I mean, not even loud at all. We were kinda whispering. And what did you do when the explosion happened? Well, the rest of the class just, we all just ran to the back and opened the windows to breathe. Were you worried for your friend? Of course I was worried for my friend. Is he a good friend of yours? I'd say we're like best friends, yeah. You, Matty, and Lawrence, right, - you guys? - Yeah, yeah. The three of you are tight? - Yeah, we're like... - yeah. Have you visited Matty in the hospital? No, I was going to go today, yeah. How'd you become friends with Lawrence? Have you been friends since you were little or... No, we did... That was... No, we recently became friends. Yeah? What prompted that? I think it was this one time when he gave me his homework. Aha! - There it is. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Whenever I need help, he just, he's always there. And you... No, I just... offer your friendship? Yeah like, whatever he needs, I'll be there. - Protection. - You got his back. - Yeah, I got his back. - Protection? Does he need protection a lot? I mean, you know, like a kid like that in a school like this, kinda, you know. People make, people poke fun, so... What's going on with your face? What are you talking about? I'm talking about the mark I can see on your face, high on your cheek, what happened? You know, I mean, you can take the sunglasses off. Oh, these are actually prescription. I'm like short-sighted, I kinda need them to see, so... Your, your teachers let you wear them in class? Hm? Yeah, 'cause they know I can't afford new ones. Did some kid rough you up a little after school? Did you steal somebody's lunch money? No, I don't think a kid - would rough me up. - What happened to your face? No, you don't look like you get roughed up - by other kids much. - No. Are you the rougher-upper? Yeah, I'd say so. It was a fight. It was just a fight, and yeah. Yeah? Who was in the fight with you? I don't think that's important. I don't think that's relevant. It's actually our job to find out. So it doesn't matter if you think it's relevant or not. - Who was in the fight with you? - Yeah but, like, we're talking about Matty, so I don't know what this has to do with that at all. Were you in the fight with Matty? No. The fight happened on school grounds? Um, yeah. Do you get many phone calls home? Had a few. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. How'd that go over? What did they say? Um, it was like... just like don't do it again. It happens. Blah, blah, blah. Yeah. It happens? Yeah. You and your dad have a close relationship? Mm-hmm. Closer than say with your mom? My mom actually isn't around. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. Yeah. You said they called them on the phone. Mm, you said parents, I just went with parents. You know your dad is crossing the line sometimes, and it's not okay. Yeah, but I can deal with that. Yeah, but clearly you can't. All right, Matty was right. This is not something you need to put up with. All right, J.C. I'm done with this. You're done with this. Yeah, I'm, I'm done with this. Right, that's what I'm saying to you. - You're done with this. - Mm-hmm. You may leave. Oh, so you're telling me to leave. - Thank you. - I'm going because I wanna go. Thank you very much. All right, don't tell me what to do. We'll call you in if we have any questions. Someone's gonna shoot us, boy. No one's gonna shoot at me. Watch your fuckin' shoes, bro! - Stop. - Stop. Don't... What are you doing? Shit. Open it, open it, open it, open it, open it. - Go. - Oh, my God. Where are the lights? Come on, guys, let's get it. Come on! You'd like that. What's this gonna do? It's gonna do exactly what I want it to do. What the fuck was that? - Let's go. - What the fuck was that? - Just leave, just leave. - Let's go, let's go. - We gotta go, we gotta go. - Go, go. Just go on. - No, no, we all gotta go. - Just go. Wait by the door. You wanna get in trouble? We're not getting in trouble. We're gonna get in trouble. Wait, wait, actually... He's actually... Wait. Of course I'm right. I'm always fucking right. - Matty, w need to go! - Let's go! Let's go. We have to get out of here! Have a seat. Hi. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. I know I was running late. I'll be there. No, I haven't changed my mind. Listen, I can't talk right now. I have to go. Okay. Really upset. They were talking about the accident that happened yesterday, and she just fell apart. Excuse me? Who let you in here? You can't be in here. You can smell it. What? You can smell the drugs in the pee. That's how I found out that Adam was using drugs. What, he forgot to flush? He forgot. He always forgets. You know why people do drugs in the toilets? - This is a school! - Okay! Look, will you just put the gun away, please? Please, just put it away! You're gonna fuck us both here! She found pot in a bag. Her mother did, and then she found, like, condoms, and I don't know, she's acting out. She's just acting out. Did my brother... What? - Did my brother... - Yeah, I don't know. She said... She said she's in love with an older guy. I don't know. Fuck. You know, my father was like that. He had whoever he wanted. Perhaps I have hundreds of half brothers all over the world. That's a scary thought. He had no sense of right and wrong. He would always put us in danger. That's how I grew up, always in danger. You know what my father did? Hmm? - What? - You know? He killed himself. He smoked 100 cigarettes in one day. He drank 10 bottles of ouzo. In seven days, he was dead. You can do whatever you want with your own life but when you start destroying the lives of other people, you have to go. Let's go. But nothing unusual to report? - Nothing... - No, I don't... I mean, are you suggesting that she - intentionally burned a student? - Oh, I'm not, I'm just... No, no, no, no. I'm actually not at all. - I didn't, uh... - She's a very careful and intelligent person. Have you been at the school long? - Uh, yes, I have. - Mm-hmm. Too long to count. - Oh? - How's that? Uh, I went to school here. And you teach English? Yes, I teach English. Let me know if you... need any lessons. I... - It's a joke. - I know it is. It's actually funny because I've noticed the grammar of some of the students here is... Oh, it's suffering. - Thank you. I'll review that. - Yes, but I assume it's just a habit, not, not as a result - of your instruction. - It's hard to teach these kids, you know, proper English when they wanna, you know. Right, like it's not very straight to conjugate Yeah. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. It's just, it's from earlier. Please continue. - Yes, from earlier. - Yeah. What are you doing? Babe, we gotta prep for tomorrow. I have to leave. What are you talking about? Where's your apron? We got a... - we've a shit ton of stuff. - No, no, no. I have to leave. I've gotta go. I have to get out of here, okay? What are you talking about? Hey, I'm sorry. Don't touch me! I saw you. I saw you. You gave one of your little pill bags to Matty and that chick Toni whatever. These. Your weed and your pills. Gave it to the kids! You gave it to Matty and then look what happened. You think I caused that? - Yeah. - No. They would have been doing that anyway whether they were taking drugs or not. And if they weren't taking my drugs, they'd be taking someone else's, and I really believe that I'm a better person to provide them than other people out there on the streets. I'm sorry. - Let me come with you. - No. - No, I wanna come with you. - No, no. - Yeah, let me come with you. - No! I know you do, but you have your own stuff to deal with. Look at you, you're saving up... so that you can go study... and you almost have enough money. And then in a few years, you'll be sitting in some little office, and you'll have a little notepad and pencil and glasses on a string. On a string? Yeah, you know, like on a chain. I don't wear glasses. Well, you'll have to to look like a real psychiatrist. And then... one day you'll look up and... I'll walk in. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. Can I show you something? Yeah, come in. No, it's on, um, it's on Lisa's computer. - Yeah. - Can you come with me? - Sure, are you okay? - Excuse me? - I'm fine. - Um... Do you know how to get to the principal's office? Uh, yeah, from here, the easiest way is gonna be, um, keep going down this hallway, uh, you'll see a doorway to the stairs, take the stairs two flights down. - Two? - Yeah, two flights down, right, and then when you get to that level, right, it's gonna be level two, you're gonna turn right, there's gonna be a double door. You want the right door. You go down that hallway. - Um, you'll get to a rotunda. - Oh, my God. Okay, so, down... This is the easiest way from here. - It's just two flights down? - Where did you come from? We're gonna go two flights down? Two flights down, take a right... We got it, thank you. Go through the rotunda, you're gonna come in at your six o'clock and you're gonna go to... You're welcome. There's construction the other way, so... What do you mean? Well, like, are we gonna rehearse for the play? Are we gonna cancel the play? We have the dress rehearsal. - The show is tomorrow. - We can make time. So we're gonna completely forget about Matty? - No one's forgetting about him. - We haven't forgot about him. Wait, wait, wait. It seems like we don't care. It's like now he's not here. Well, I mean, that's why I'm here. I'm the understudy. We can sort of do without a lead. Well, I feel like we have the space open where Matty would be, and we have someone else reading the lines for him. So it's like he's there in spirit. Something like that. Alex, what do you think about this? It doesn't make sense. Okay, but you also don't know a lot of blocking. That doesn't make sense! Guys, guys, guys! - What! - Guys! Calm down, all right. We have to make a decision. - Are we gonna do it or not? - We can't do it without actually having him here. I don't think we should do it. We can't do it without him. It's not fair. So what's going on? You wanna talk about it? I guess. Hey, I'm sorry. Hi. Can we talk for a minute? I'm sorry to interrupt. Oh, right now? Yeah, yeah, it's pretty important. Hey, I'll be right back. What's up? So Alis found this on Lisa's computer. Apparently, some kids have been harassing her on social media, on Twitter, Facebook. She collected it all. There's images and tweets and threats, comments about the way she looks. Okay, that's... It's pretty upsetting stuff. It's pretty ugly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We just copied it to the USB. We should show it to Jess. Yeah, absolutely. Right? Yeah. I think... Okay, thank you. I'll let you know. So, uh, um, this is my office. Would you like to sit in your seat? - That's great, thank you. - Nice, yes, you're very welcome. - Thank you. - Have a seat. And I'm powerless in this situation. I'm sort of like Harvey Keitel in Pulp Fiction. I clean up the mess, but I have no power. So I'm just gonna sit right here. So, it would seem we have a mess to clean up? Uh, no, that's not what I said. I said I'm powerless. That should make you happy. Thank you for letting us use your office. Absolutely. How did you feel about the response to the explosion? Did everything go according to protocol, according to plan? Were there any glitches? As far as I can tell, everything went according to plan. - Mm-hmm. - Um, the school safety desk at the front, at the entrance... received a call pretty immediately that an accident was happening on the fourth floor. They called FDNY and NYPD immediately. They were here within minutes, and everything went according to protocol as far as I can see. And when did you respond to the fourth floor? I was not in the building at the time of the accident. The AP was there. He's not required to be there in the morning. You could designate an AP. I didn't, uh, suggest that he was required - to be in the school. - Okay. There was a... There was an emergency. I was away. What, what kind of, uh, emergency? What does that have to do with this incident? My wife was in the hospital. Look, my wife had... my ex-wife. No, you don't get into personal business. We're talking about an incident. He wasn't there. There was a, - there was a supervisor on site. - Look, my ex-wife had tried to kill herself, all right? On the day of the incident? No. No. Like three weeks ago and I was picking her up. Is she all right? We were... pregnant, and she... we lost it. I'm, uh, having an abortion tonight. I was supposed to be there like an hour ago, actually. You know, I never wanted Matty? I never wanted him. Even after he was born. When he was born... I loved him more than anything in the world and I still do. But there was always this bit of resentment I had. So stupid. And now... and now he's... he's not who he used to be. This was the last place he was when he was who he was. When he was... It's my, it's my fault. It's my fault. Tell me why you're saying that. Did you have any reason to suspect that Miss Dhawan was being bullied? What does that have to do with anything? Do you know J.C. Caraballo? I'm aware of who he is. He's a student here. And do you, do you know him? I-I know who he is. Hey, guys. What the fuck? That did not go well. Tha-tha-that just went about as terrible as it possibly could! - Easy! It is what it is. - It is what it is? Are you kidding me? She was, she was, she was... They got my balls in their hands! They're-they're-they're-they're grabbing, and they're squeezing! - Easy. - Easy! - Just move on to the next thing. - Where the fuck is Amy? Where's my wife? She cannot be wandering the halls! Heather, Heather! Oh, and of course on top of all that, now I've got this charge for domestic violence hanging over my head. Hey, there's no way she's gonna report that. If she did, they'd deport J.C.'s father! She's aware of that, you told her! - Yeah, but... - Easy. Whew! I'm fucked. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck. Yeah, I think we need to really stick to the facts 'cause we're getting into her emotional state and the kids' emotional state, and that's like, that's not... Okay, um, do you... So you put the keys away on the day of the incident... - Yes. - after you locked - the cabinet? - I, I, I put the keys in the office room with the other keys in the faculty room, yes. Okay. And that's where you always keep them? I us... Yes, usually. I usually do that. - Usually? - Usually? Yes. Yes, she has a routine. She followed the routine. Yes, there are rules, and there are rules about... There are rules about how to put the keys away. I'm sorry, I'm very tired... No, right, no, of course. And I'm just saying... And I followed the rules about how to store the keys. No, I mean, I hear that you're saying what you usually do, but do you remember specifically on that day because, I mean, I know, routines, you can kinda get lost in the routine, and you don't do it sometimes, and... Do you remember doing it on that day? Ye-Yes. You do? Yes, I mean... - Except... - You can answer the question, but you keeping asking her 50 different ways, she's giving you the same answer. Except what? Except there was... Except there was what? - I was running late for class... - Mm-hmm. And in some of the student evaluations, there was something about me being late, so I, I had the keys with me and I left them on the desk in the classroom. In room 42? Th-The classroom I was in prior to the one I was going to. - Okay. - And, uh, they were on my desk but only for the duration of the class because after the class I came back, and they were still where I left them and then I put them away. So they were on the desk... during the class period? Yeah. But when you came back, so you left the room? For just a short period of time, and then when the class was over and I came back, they were still where I left them. So they were left unattended in an open room for the duration of the class period? Yes, but they were exactly where I left them when I came back so... And was there another class - in that other classroom... - No, no, - at that time? - There was not. So it was empty? Yeah. They were... I knew where they were. I-I-I was running late, so I didn't want to be late for class. I love being a teacher. Okay, what? He made a copy of the key, and then he put it back. Who, who, when... Are you saying that Matty did that? Yeah. But there wasn't really a plan or anything. We were just kinda messing around. Smoking weed. And then... Did you go? No, I was grounded. - Oh, my God. - They're not gonna deport you. - Why would they deport you? - They'll fucking deport me, bro. No, they're not gonna deport you... What are you talking about? As long as you don't talk shit, they won't be able to. - Then of course not. - I didn't say anything. You didn't say anything? What's so bad about Mexico anyway? What the fuck? Have you been to fucking Mexico, bro? I wouldn't last a day. Imagine what you would. You wouldn't even fucking last an hour! You need to chill. Don't tell me to fucking chill, bro? Take it down a notch. What the fuck are you talking about my dad for? Look at your fucking eye! Look at your eye! Are you in my fucking situation? - Look at your eye! - What? - You're gonna defend him? - What the fuck. 'Cause your dad is an asshole! You don't know what the fuck he does to me! - You know it! - What? Don't push me. - Don't push me. - Wanna get fucking physical? You know that your dad's a dick. You're not in my fucking house! You're not in my fucking house... Everybody knows the situation. You don't know what I've been through, all right? - So shut the fuck up! - It doesn't matter! - Shut up! - You like going through it? - You like it? - Shut the fuck up! - Really? - Shut up! You sound real familiar, right? I bet you hear that all the time, right? Oh, my fucking God. - That sound real familiar... - Keep talking shit, I swear to God I'm gonna knock the fuck outta you. You sound just like your little pops. - Don't push me. - Shut the fuck up! - Don't push me. - Shut up! Now you're gonna make me... Gonna fucking fall, bitch. - What, what? - No, chill. Chill! - Fuck you mean chill? - Chill! Don't tell me what the fuck to do. It's not even that big of a deal. What the fuck you mean it's not that big of a deal? Because it was Matty's idea! What the fuck are you trying to say? We were there too. It's our fault! - So? - We didn't say no, did we? - No, we didn't say no. - All right then. What the fuck, it's our fault too. - You need to chill. - No, you need - to fucking chill... - You need to chill. - You really need to chill. - I swear to God... - Your gun! - I don't know where it is. - How did you let this happen? - I don't know. I... How could you possibly let this happen? That is like the most important part of your entire job! We are police officers at an educational institution in charge of monitoring children, and now your gun is on the loose. Are you out of your mind? Oh, shit. It's stuck. It's stuck! Holy shit. They said, what if we messed around with the chemicals and played a joke on Miss D because... A joke? Not really a joke, but... they just wanted to get back at her because she had told the principal on J.C. for acting out in class and then his dad beat him up really bad, but he was only acting up in class because... The only reason that he was acting out in class was because Miss D caught me smoking and then she told my dad and then... and then my mom found out, and then I had to go live with her. So who was actually there, Matty and who else? What are you doing? We had quite an evil eye on us. That's why it happened. Evil eye, you know. Bad energy. Evil eye, bad energy, you know. - An evil eye. - Yeah. - Is on us. - Yeah. - Elevator got stuck. - Exactly. Awesome. That's great. That's great. In five minutes, we'll be okay. Everything happens for a reason. I'm not talking to you anymore. - Hey. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Uh, good. Uh, do you have Ross Fairchild's contact info? Maybe. Why? I-I found something of Matty's, and I wanted to give it back to the family. Um, I mean, I could give that to them if you wanted to give it to me. Uh, it's just really personal, and I'd prefer... I'd prefer to give it to him myself, if you don't mind. Um... yeah, I mean, I guess that should be okay. Hang on. I can write it down. That would be great. Thank you. You don't believe in that, why? Why you don't believe that everything happens for a reason? Explain to me, please. Because it doesn't... What you're saying doesn't make any sense. It is like you don't believe in love. You don't believe in love? With love, you can... - you can create miracles. - Oh, my God. This now, this is my hell. This is my hell. Was it just weed? No. No? You have something on you. What is that? Give me that. What is that? It's... it's not Tylenol. It's just... Matty... he... he likes me, you know? And he... he just wanted to show me that, you know, he wouldn't let anybody... mess around with me. People make choices. That's why, okay. Everybody makes a choice. Choices affect other people. Okay. It's not some grand plan. It's not some deeper meaning when shit happens. Hi. I'm sure they will let us out soon. Don't cry. It's okay. It's okay. We... You okay? Uh... Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Uh... What? I fucked up. You lose the glasses, or I take them off your face. I'm pretty sure you can't tell me what to do. It's your... - Right now? - Don't make me say it again. - Oh, sass. - Thank you. - Can I just hold 'em? - No, no, no, you can't. Meanwhile, uh, Lawrence? Miss Dhawan's keys? Yeah. What happened to them? Who knows? It was Matty. He, uh, he got, he got 'em. He had the keys. Do you know how he came into possession of the keys? - No. - No? Okay. Uh, but he accessed the supply closet in the science lab? That was me. - It was you? - Yeah. He gave you the keys? We-We all were together. Keys? How would I know about the keys? You know about the keys? All right, so here's the situation, J.C. As you said yourself in the locker room, you are an accomplice in this crime which has been committed, so it is to your advantage to be forthcoming in this situation. This is like when you watch TV and there's a cop drama, this is like that, only this is your life. I know your status. I know the status of your father and I need you to be forthcoming, or there may be serious consequences. Do you understand what I am saying to you or do I need to be more explicit? I understand the words. I just don't know where they're coming from. - I don't think you know... - You're trying to go back? Oh, okay. You guys all right? No, Lawrence just has some jokes. No, I don't have anything to joke about now. I mean... Lawrence recognizes the severity of the situation, J.C. - You can drop the act. - There's no act. You can drop this bravado that you have. There is no act. There is actually no protecting your father at this point. He's under investigation. It's in motion, all right? We are here talking to you right now, in this case. In the case with your father, you are the victim. Now, in the case of this school, you are potentially a perpetrator. I suggest that you start telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me God. Let's go, all right, that's enough. They're looking for the truth. The only problem is, what is the truth? Theoretically, I'm the only person that could tell them, and I can't speak. Does it start with me? Or does it start with Adam smiling at Toni? Or Shannon hiring Adam. Or Miss D telling on Toni? Or Toni's dad grounding Toni? Or her mom taking her away from her dad? Or Principal Williamson overreacting because he's mad at his wife! Who can you blame? If Heather hadn't made that noise that night, the first beaker would have exploded as planned. And Miss D would have been wearing protective gear, and I would have been on the other end of the table! Whatever. The only questions that's worth its weight is this, is there a fucking script, or does everything happen by accident? One thing leading to another, a simple chain reaction. And if it does happen by accident, why does one accident happen and not another? Why me? Why the hell me? That's actually fucking great. Let's go! - Shh! - Let's go! Fuck, bro. Yo, there's a ghost in here. What? What the fuck you mean there's a ghost in here? What are you, a pussy? Come on, man. What the fuck you mean am I a pussy? What the fuck? Of course I'm not... I'm not a fucking bitch. Shut the fuck up. - What are you doing? - What is wrong with you? - Shh! - Geez. I'm good, I'm good. No, no, no. Serious question. Why is Toni not here, bro? Yo, her mom grounded her. Yo, she's such a bitch. What the fuck? Guys, I really hurt myself. - Shit. - Why did you trip? What the fuck. Nothing bad's gonna happen. Are you gonna tell 'em just like you told me? I guess I have to. I'm proud of you. Hey. Hey. Mind if I... Please, come join me. You're leaving? Yeah. You're lucky. Why do you say that? I'd like to leave sometimes. Well, you can. Why don't you? It's not that easy. Well, nothing's that easy. I wouldn't go back to that. What? To being a teenager again. How were, how were you as a teenager? Being a teenager was hell. What? Why? I don't know, nothing fell into place, you know. What were you like? Awkward, stupid. Lost. Are you gay? I mean, I'm whatever I want to be I guess. You want some of this? There's a little left. I... Uh... Mrs. Fairchild? Yes, yes, I'm Mrs. Fairchild. Have you found my husband? Have you located him? He called me, and I was there, I was there with Matty, and he was supposed to come to meet me, but he said that he had to... Hello. You can see me? Of course I can see you. What do you mean? Because nobody else can. See? - Who are you? - I'm Matty. I'm Nicky. Hi. Are you... a ghost? I hope not. - I thought maybe there was... - He was gonna take care - of things? - He was gonna take care of things, um, - he said that he was... - Let's go! - He sounded angry. - Okay, we need to go. Do you think that he's looking... Thank you, Toni. Please just wait here, okay? - I need to come with you. - I need you to wait here. - Sir. - Come on! - John! - Please, wait. - You want me to stay here? - Please. Hello, hello, excuse me? Hello, is anyone here? I don't want to be alone right now, so it's good that we're all together. It was after school Monday. Amy, we're in a meeting here. What's going on? Dad? Who are you? Who are they? - What are you doing here? - Who are you? - You are the principal? - Yes, I am the principal! Who are you? My name is Nikos Kazantzoglou, and I want to report... Where's the teacher? If she did do it, why wasn't she told to give all of the students goggles? Why the hell doesn't the school even own goggles? And if we don't have goggles here, why don't the parents know so that we can supply the fucking goggles! Where's the teacher? Where's the teacher? Where's the teacher? Where's the teacher? Where's the teacher? Mr. Fairchild. - Where's the teacher? - Mr. Fairchild. - Where's the teacher? - Look, look, she's not here. This is my favorite part of the movie right here. Where's the fucking teacher? All right, I know you're looking for Miss Dhawan. She's not here. Look, I can call her. You want me to call her? - Call her. - All right, I'm calling her. - Principal Williamson... - Yeah. Has been delayed. You can imagine that he's probably speaking to who God knows who, and so he's coming, he's on his way. - Do we have a timeline? - Uh... - He did not do anything. - Amy! Shut up. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! - Oh, my God. - Put the phone away! Put the phone down, put it away! - I'm putting it away. - Everybody! - Dad, stop! - Where is she? I am representing thousands of parents. - Duly noted... - Don't... - smirk at me. - What? You just gave me a little look. Just let my daughter go. Let my daughter get out of here please? There's a child here! - Shut up! - Amy... Just let her get out. Let her get out of here! - Are you a father? - Am I a father? - Yes. - Yeah, I'm a father! Think, Ross. Think. 'Cause this time is not an accident, is it? You think there's gonna be an accident like the one that killed my kid! This won't be an accident, Ross! Matty died? He might as well be dead! Let's talk about it. Let's talk... This is a big misunderstanding. Let my kid out of here. - Let the girl go. - Let her go! Just everybody sit down and let me think! Please sit down and let me think! Everybody just sit down. - Just sit down! - Sit down. Just do what he says! You, uh... You and you, you two, get out. Okay. - Okay. Let's go. - Go, go, go, go. Okay, come on, come on. No, no, no, no, no! Sit down. No! Everybody, sit down! I told you, he didn't do anything. I don't even know why you're here. I'm sorry. Sit down. - Put the gun down! - No, no, no! - Put it down! Put it down! - Put the gun down. I did it. - That's not what we... - Yeah. That's not what we were talking about. Put the gun down! I need you to put the gun down. Okay, where is Jess? No, she is accepting responsibility. A statement like that isn't helping anything. Just shut up! No one's going anywhere until I get some answers. I know more information now. Do you wanna hear it? Where's the teacher? Look, Ross, there's some things you don't know. It was my fault. The children were under my care. - Okay, I assume... - Where's the teacher? The one that killed my son! She's not here. Put it down! - No, no, no! - Put the gun down! Put the gun down. Put the gun down! Put that gun down! Oh, my God. And I died. I shan't get on board either. Why do you have a gun? I think people change. Is there a fucking script? Why the hell me. Day became a good day. Will you just put the gun away. In his world, fire does not exist. Matty's the best fucking thing in my life! Everybody makes a choice. He wants to save the world. I can change it. The world we see is just a movie in our mind. John never fell asleep. It was my dad who fell asleep in the lab. John never lost his gun. David never met Nicky. Nicky never found the school. As for my friends... they did the play without me. They left a void for me. Nobody knew I was there. Except perhaps for Toni. I kissed her. I kissed Toni... and she smiled. So I came back to life... for another 62 years. How long do you have?
