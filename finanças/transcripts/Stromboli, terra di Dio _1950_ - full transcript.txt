They have found me who sought me not ...” Isaiah 65:1 SPRING 1948 ... IN A CAMP FOR DISPLACED PERSONS WHO, BATTERED BY THE WAR, SOUGHT REFUGE IN ITALY May I borrow your blue blouse ? You've all gone crazy ... since they put the soldiers on the other side of the compound. The poor men were prisoners for years ... Now that they're back home, they deserve a little fun. What did she say ? That we're worse off because we have no news of our families and no homes to return to. They're not here for fun either. My soldier is still looking for his mother and father. They were in Cassino, but they had to leave. Who knows where they are now ? The poor man's gone to Rome many times to look for them. Poorboy. He's so big and handsome. I wish he were my soldier. Karin. You hear your sweetheart ? See you. - Good luck. - I hope so. - Hi. - Good evening. - Well ? - It's cold tonight. - “Cold” ? - Yes, cold. Instead of sweet words, you complain it's cold ? - What do you want me to say ? - Something else. - Hey, you're not allowed here. - Leave me alone. I'm not getting in trouble over you. Like I haven't seen my fair share too. All right. I'll go. You leaving or not ? You can't stay here. All right, Sergeant. I'm going. Get out of here, boys. Get out of here. You're not allowed here. Poor wretches, here we are in this hell Condemned to tyranny I like you. Have you decided ? Take it or leave it. I don't understand. What do you mean ? Marry me or leave me. What's so funny ? You're crazy. You know nothing about me. We've spoken a few times through this barbed wire, and now you want to marry me ? Of course. What if you're making a mistake ? I'm crazy about you. Later, if you find out I'm different from what you think ? I know women. If you don't behave, I'll show you ! What does that mean ? I know this one and this one, and this and this. I'll slap you. Oh, you'll spank me. Damn this thing. You have to decide. I can't keep shirking my duties and coming here. If you really mean it, I'll let you know tomorrow night. He's simple and nice. He lives on an island in the Mediterranean. He says it's beautiful. Do you like him ? He speaks a strange dialect. He's amusing enough, but he's just a boy. - What will you do ? - I don't know. What can I do ? He wants to marry me. He's crazy. I'll see tomorrow. It all depends on my visa for Argentina. If I don't get it, I know what I'll do. Buenos dias. - Let's bring this one in. - Very well. She's the biggest liar in the bunch. Our information on her defies belief. She speaks Italian. She was born in Lithuania. Fine. Bring her in. - Good morning. - Buenos dias. Take down her personal information. First and last name ... nationality, age ... father's name, mother's name, and occupation. - What's your name ? - Karin Bjornsen. - Place of birth ? - Kovno, Lithuania. - Date of birth ? - May 8, 1920. - Father's name ? - Karl Bjornsen. - Mother's maiden name ? - Maria Pasvalys. - Occupation ? - Unemployed. The consul wishes to know how you happen ... to be interned here. I lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, married to an architect who died after the German invasion. Then I went to Yugoslavia, and when it was invaded, I fled to Italy. because the Gestapo was after me ... I entered Italy secretly and obtained residence here with false identification papers. After September 8 ... though I was being pursued ... I managed to escape the German police. Then I was interned by the Italian authorities. Did you bring the affidavit to emigrate to Argentina ? The consul says the letter you've submitted isn't enough ... to authorize your transfer to Argentina. I was expecting as much. “You have declared your consent before myself and the witnesses gathered here ... to marry according to the rite of the Holy Roman Church. Our Lord Jesus Christ elevated matrimony ... to the dignity of a sacrament. This matrimony will produce divine grace and the effects sanctioned by the sacred canons ... principally the obligation to support each other and provide a religious, moral, and physical education for your children, but it will also have civil effects according to the laws of the state, which you must respect and observe.” How will you travel ? I'll take a train from Rome and get to Messina and then see about getting to Stromboli. Here she comes. Will you get that for me ? - Thank you. - Good-bye. - Be sure to write. - All the best. I'm cold. Let's go over there. - Would you like to sit here ? - Thanks a lot. I want to put my coat on. I was a prisoner too, in Australia. I was in South Africa. - You going to Stromboli ? - Yes. I'm the lighthouse keeper. You can see the volcano now. Come. Look at the crater. You see the lava trail ? There's one on the other side too. - Is it always active ? - Always. Look. Look at the stones tumbling down to the sea. Wait. - My suitcases. - Yes, sit down. - I'll get them. - Give me the other ones too. Here. Vincenzo ! - How are you ? - Fine. - Grab some of this stuff. - You, grab that suitcase. Hey, kid, come here ! You go ahead. I'll be right there. - We should go on ahead ? - Yes. I'll see you when I come back from the lighthouse. Yeah, see you. I'm Antonio Mastrostefano. You know my Aunt Rosaria ? - Run and tell her I'm here. - Let me carry one ! - Welcome back, Antonio. - Thank you, Father. - This is my wife. - Nice to meet you, and best wishes. Thank you, Father. Welcome. You got married as soon as you got the papers I sent ? Fine, fine. I'm very happy. I never thought I'd get back here. It makes me happy when someone comes back ... and brings his wife here to raise a family. You see, so many people from here have already left ... or are waiting to leave for Argentina, Australia ... America, France, England ... wherever they have a relative to send money for the trip. Life is hard here. Even the earth is hard. Yes, but ... St. Bartolo, our patron saint, will protect you. It was St. Bartolo ... who stopped the lava and the fire up there ... in the great eruption of '41 ... and saved our homes. I'm sure you'll be happy here. This is your home now. - Thank you, Father. - You're welcome. Good-bye, Father. It's a baby. Why did you kiss the priest's hand ? It's the custom. This is a deserted island. There's no one here. If there was nobody here, there'd be no baby, right ? Aunt Rosaria ! Thank God you're finally back. How are you ? The Madonna was good to me. This is Karin, my wife. My aunt from America. - Welcome. - You really lived in America ? Yes, many years ago. Lots of people here have been there. - And you came back here ? - This is my home. Aunt Rosaria, where's my boat ? It rotted away. How's the fishing this year ? Not bad. We can't complain. - Did Vincenzo Bernao come back ? - Yes ... but he left right away for Australia. You have no one to send you money, but his relatives sent him some. Look, that whole family left for the continent ... when Alfio died in the war. Everyone around here leaves. This is our house. - Where are the keys ? - By the door. Aren't you coming ? Come on, hurry up. We'll fix it up just like before. Like before ? We have lots of furniture. Look. Come look. This is our bedroom. Look how beautiful. The sea. Karin, come here ! - Where's all my furniture ? - At my house. Boys, have my furniture brought over and I'll give you something. That's lava from the mountain. I can see that. - Is that all there is ? - Of course. Houses, fields ... the lava destroyed everything, but the people of Stromboli are very tough, my dear. We rebuild it all. This land ... How do you say it ? We brought this fresh soil here. You see ? We replant everything. Capers, vines. Leave me alone ! What do I care about vines ... and your good soil ? I want off this damned island ! Even those born here have gone far away ! What's the matter ? What's wrong ? Listen, this is my home, and you're my wife. You're here because I'm here. 19,377 lire. - Is that all ? - Yes. - What will you do with it ? - Nothing. Yes, I am your wife, and this is your house. I know. You slept well last night, didn't you ? Well, I didn't. I'm different. Very different. I belong to another race. This is no life for civilized people. Go ahead. Count your 19,000 lire. You need much more for a woman like me. Calm down. What are you saying ? You call this money, but it's nothing for a woman like me ! I'm a civilized human being. I'm used to other things. What can you do with that money ? - Everything has to change here. - It will. Yes, but when ? You have to do it now. I'm your wife, and this is your house, but I have to live in it too, and I'm not an animal. I know, but you'll see. Yes, I'll see. Are you (IFS/mg ? What's the matter ? - Are you crying ? - No. No, it's not you. Little boy ... what's your name ? I ... Say something. Say something. Talk to me. Talk. Talk. Get the ladder. - What are you doing here ? - Your husband sent us, ma'am. - Who are you ? - Us ? We're half American, just back from America two months ago. Your husband sent us to clean up the house. We were all in New York. My son stayed there. I worked as a dockhand in Brooklyn and made a lot of money. We'd even take the car to go fishing on Sundays. I'd even drive a car to pick up my relief check. We all had cars in America. But we came back to Stromboli. You see that hole ? The volcano is very dangerous. It erupts a lot ... and hurls up stones ... that fall down on our poor houses and destroy them. They set everything on fire, like in 1944. - And you left America ? - Yes, America's for the young. I'm an old man. I want to die on Stromboli. My friend's not only old, but he's gone soft in the head too. I don't want to die here. I want to go back over to my son in Brooklyn. He's saving up for my trip. I should be able to go back in about ten years. - How old are you ? - Seventy-three. Signora ! Father, here she is ! - Good morning. How are you today ? - Good morning, Father. I was wondering how you're getting along. As you can see, I stay out here. My house is full of little old men talking about America all the time. - Sit down. - Thank you. With a little time and patience, everything will be all right. Everything ? The island and the volcano too ? No, I mean your home and you. Maybe I can help you. I told your husband he could take the tiles from the Molettas' house. The Molettas left this island 26 years ago. I doubt they'll be back. You see, I'm a sort of trustee ... for all those who've left the island. You could make use of those tiles now, and nobody will mind a little robbery. This way, those who've left help those who stay. And I act as the middleman. Then try to help us. I can't live like this. Antonio's just a kid. I love him, but he doesn't understand a woman like me. I think he does. I know how hard he tried to find work. When you got here, the fishing season had already begun. The boats already had full crews. There are only four boats on Stromboli. The others come from neighboring islands. Yet Antonio still managed to find a place. He sacrificed his pride. He had his own boat once, you know. But he's adapted for your sake. I know, because he told me. I know he's doing his best ... but doesn't he understand that I can't live here ? that he has to take me away ? You need a lot of money to emigrate, and a place to go. Even those born here want to leave. So you can imagine me, a foreigner. These horrible rocks ... this desolation, that terror. This island drives me mad. Help me, please. You're both young. Make Antonio save his money instead of spending it. Then perhaps you'll be able to leave too someday. But while you're here ... make your house warm and inviting and be patient. Then waiting will be easier. “God helps those who help themselves,” the proverb goes. God has never helped me. Don Angelo ! - What did you catch ? - Bonito. - Throw down the tackle ! - We're home ! What did you catch ? We've got a boat full of fish ! Ours is full of bonito ! Karin ! Look ! We got thousands like this ! All the boats are full ! We're rich. You understand ? We're going to sell it all in Messina. What are you talking about ? The fish. It's fantastic ! I'm soaked ! We don't need a middleman. We'll sell it all ourselves. Directly. See you. - Signora. - Yes ? All finished. You want to see ? Yes, I'm coming. - Do you like it ? - You've done a great job. - Is it all right ? - Just wonderful. Thank you very much. Did you finish painting that bench ? I want it over here. Is the chair all right ? No, I told you to shorten the legs, remember ? I did. Should I cut them off ? No, I want it to look like the other chairs. - I want them all real low, you see ? - All right. Good morning. Would you like to come in and see my house ? It's very kind of you to come see me. Come in. Don't be shy. Come inside. Would you ask if they'd like to come in ? She's asking if you'd like to go inside. - Why are they leaving ? - How would I know ? - What did they say ? - Did you hear them say anything ? Good morning, Aunt Rosaria. - Come in and see the house. - No. What's going on ? What do they have against me ? Why do they all treat me like this ? Because you behave badly. You have no modesty. But I'm not doing anything wrong. It's not my fault if I'm different. I am different ! I think and act differently. I'm making the house nice for my husband. What can you have against that ? You have no modesty, my child. - Is the weather clearing up ? - No, the wind's too strong. - My husband can't come back tonight. - I don't think so. Then do me a favor. Take me to the lady ... with the sewing machine who made my curtains. I want to sew my new dress. The time will pass quickly if I have something to do. She's no good. She has a bad reputation. I don't care about her reputation. I'm old enough to take care of myself. - Is it far from here ? - The other side of the church. Wait. I'll get my fabric, and you can walk me there. - Why did she do that to me ? - It was probably just by chance. - That's her house. - That one ? - Will you come with me ? You could introduce me. - No. - Why not ? - My wife's very jealous. I understand. - Good night. Thanks. - Good night. Good evening. Could you sew this for me on your machine ? Yes. Good. Here. You see ? And here too. Oh, it's you. - Are you sick ? What's wrong ? - A touch of malaria. Oh, malaria. - Then who's at the lighthouse ? - My coworker. The poor fellow's all alone there till you get back ? That's right. - Signora. - Yes' ? Thank you. Good. A few stitches here too. You want to try it on ? Come with me. Thank you. Best to try it on. Look. It's dark already. Angelina ! Don't you remember me ? Aren't we good enough for your place ? Start the music, Ignazio. She closed the shutters ! Where's your husband, out to pasture ? - What's that woman doing in there ? - I'd like to kiss her. Are you crazy ? - What's going on ? - There's a pretty lady in there. What's gotten into you ? - Karin ! - You're back. - Get out of here ! - Wait. I have to change. You want me to look ridiculous ? Hurry up ! Come on. Get moving. You have no shame. I'll break your face. Why are you angry ? I didn't do anything wrong. - I wanted her to sew something. - So you go to a prostitute's house ? - We'll settle this at home. - Fine. I'm not scared of you. Move it. I suppose you came back rich. The money's gone to your head. That's why you're being such a bully. How much did you get for the fish ? Here. - How much is it ? - Not even 30,000 lire. - 30,000 lire. - The others got a lot more. Why ? They're taking advantage of me. Because you're a lady, and I have to take care of you. They know I have to put up with whatever they give me, so they pay me less. But I'll work harder. I'll work for you. Don't worry about it. - Have you got a match ? - Yes. Look. You changed everything. Where are the pictures ? I put the pictures of your family away. - And the Madonna ? - The Madonna too. - My mother put that there. - I know. I didn't throw it away. I just moved it. Look. A cactus ... in the house. Don't you like it ? Yes ... maybe. I did what you said. I made the house nicer for him and for me ... to make the waiting easier. But when he saw it, it bothered him. He didn't have the courage to say anything, but he was hurt. And this morning he pulled out all his old things, those awful things. As he held those pictures and holy images in his hands ... I could feel he was angry with me. I understand him. Antonio is a good, simple boy. In all his life, his only experience has been his military service. Yes, I understand him too, Father, but who understands me ? You're the only man here ... who can understand me, perhaps. Please advise me and help me. I'm going mad. I'm so unhappy. I suffer, believe me. You must have courage. - You're both young. - Must I waste my youth ? It's inhuman. I can't go on. What do you want to do ? I don't know. You must try to find a way to help me, Father. Help me. You know what Antonio's like. He's so simple. If I don't speak to him like a child ... he doesn't understand. One word is enough to upset him. - Will you explain to him, Father ? - There's nothing to explain. He's just as unhappy as you are. Maybe even more. Then there's no way out ? No hope ? Be patient and strong. Perhaps I can write to some of our people in America or Australia ... and see if they can find work for him. Please do. Do you think it's possible ? Maybe. The people born on this island ... are good people. Take Francesco Dimattina, who left for America. He died recently, a widower with no children, and left $3,000, all his fortune, to Stromboli for the old and to keep up the cemetery. He left the money in my care. I knew you were the only one who could help us. I'm only a poor priest, but I understand human suffering. The dead find their peace in that desolate cemetery swept by the wind and burned by the sun, - while we the living ... - I know. Wouldn't you still honor your friend's memory if you gave the money to two young people who want to live ? - Perhaps, but I can't. - Please listen to me. You know nothing about me. You don't know my past. I ... I've been lost. I've sinned. I've chased after illusions and adventures ... as if driven by some evil force. Now I realize I was wrong. I'd like to change my life, but this is too much. You can't go from one extreme to another. I've known this all along. I felt compassion for you from the first time we met. I've tried to give you whatever spiritual help I could. You're such a good man. Thank you. This will make you feel better. - Drink it. - I'm so ashamed, Father. I may have made mistakes, but all I want now is a little happiness. I was born into a well-to-do family. We lost everything in the war. Then I met a man, an officer in the German army. He seemed more human than the rest. He was young and cheerful. I was swept up and lost. I've sinned, but I've paid. You're so sensitive ... a man of experience. I'm only a poor priest. I can be frank with you. I couldn't with Antonio. You're the one man who can give me comfort. I told you: I'm the priest of a small fishing community. - But I can see your human qualities. - I am a priest ! I can only assist you in confession or through prayer. You're ... as merciless as your God ! You ... Say anything you want. All I can have for you is a deep feeling of pity. May the Lord guide you ... Compose yourself. Be humble. Pray. - You're home already. - Yes. I didn't expect you. Why are you so early ? - Where you been ? - Just out for a walk. I passed by the church. What's that ? I bought it. A ferret. A ferret. - How much did you pay for it ? - Next to nothing. Tomorrow begins tuna fishing. - And these ? - Coffe. To catch fish. What did you buy this ferret for ? To catch rabbits. To catch what ? I'll show you. Look. What do you intend to do ? You're crazy ! Give it here. It's awful ! The poor animal ! That's enough ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stupid ! It's cruel and savage ! - What are you looking for ? - Octopuses. Wait. I'm coming too. Did you find something ? How are you ? - Feeling better ? - Yes. It got away. Do you have a looking glass ? - What is it ? - An octopus. An octopus ? Look. See there ? Here. Cuckold ! Cuckold ! Cuckold ! Stay out of it. It's your wife's fault. - What did she do ? - Nothing. She's just a flirt. Dinner's on the table. I'm not eating. What's the matter with you ? Are you crazy ? What have I done ? Let's go. Come on. Mass is starting. - Let's go. - Stay there. Don't move. Antonio, come on. We've been waiting for you. - You got the bailing scoop ? - Yes. Did you fix the boat ? Antonio ! - What do you want ? - I just wanted to surprise you. Come here. Pull up closer. Take us over there. Just what we needed ... a bright light. - What's that ? - She's like a bright light for fishing. Like we use to blind the octopuses. That octopus is already blind. I hope you're not sorry that I came. I wanted to see you. I want to be with you. But you have to change too. Come on. Smile. I'll go right away so I don't embarrass you in front of the others. Forget about them. Here they come. The tuna are coming. Let's go. Come on ! Oh, Jesus and Mary. Thank you, Jesus, and thank you, Mary, for the good fortune you sent us. Let's go. - How are you feeling ? - Better. Did you like the fishing ? No, it was horrible. What's the matter ? I don't feel well. Why ? Do you think ... ? - Maybe ... ? - Yes, I've known for three months. I'm going to have a baby. Karin, my goodness ! I'm so happy ... - Are you ? - Yes. Yes, I'm happy too. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. A motorboat. Has it come to help us ? No, it's from Ginostra. - What is Ginostra ? - It's a village on the other side of the island. Our home is safe. Listen. I want to talk to you. I don't want to stay here any longer. So ? So I'm leaving. - I don't want to have my baby here. - Really ? - I'm leaving. - Oh, yeah ? Yes, I'm leaving. I'm going crazy here. Rather than have a child here ... - During the eruption of '30 ... - I saw enough yesterday. I'm not interested in what happened back then. I'm going. Nothing can keep me here. But, Karin, listen. Give me what money you have. I hope you won't refuse me. It's so little anyway. Yes, too little. I know, but I'm not afraid to face life as long as I'm free to fight for myself. Oh, really ? You're not going to try to keep me here, are you ? It's no use looking at me that way ! It won't do you any good. There's nothing you can do. Antonio ! Get me some water. I want to wash. Did you hear me ? Antonio ! What are you doing ? Antonio ! Antonio ! Open up ! What are you doing Antonio ? You're crazy ! Open the door ! Antonio ! You with the boat ! Yes, you ! Help me ! Come here. Listen. You have to help me. I can't get out. My husband nailed the door shut. Help me. - Why did he do that ? - Just get me out. Come around. The stairs are on the other side. Oh, thank you ! - What happened ? - Let's not stay here. It's dangerous. Come. There. Nice, isn't it ? It's peaceful here. Sit down. My husband is jealous. He's a brute. He's jealous of you. Remember that night you were sick ... and I came by with some sewing ? He made a terrible scene. And later, when we met again. Remember when you caught that octopus ? He beat me like a beast. I can't stand it anymore. I want to go away, but I can't without help. It's impossible to escape. But if I could reach the other side of the island, then ... But I have no money. If you want, I'll help you. Really ? He's capable of anything. - You're not afraid ? - I'm not afraid. I'll ask for leave and come with you. I don't want to see him again. I want to go right away. I'll take you to Ginostra in a boat. No, the people here see everything. I'll go alone. - You can't row for five miles. - I'll walk. Then you'll have to go by way of the volcano. I don't care. I have to get there. And then ? In Ginostra they have larger boats, motorboats. I'll find someone to take me to Lipari or maybe Messina. I'll come with you. I won't leave you alone. Thank you. But you can't leave the lighthouse. Then you go on ahead. I'll join you when I have my leave. How can I do that ? You know I have nothing. I'll give you the money. I'm finished. Enough. Enough ! I can't go on. Better to die. But I haven't the courage. The courage ... I'm afraid ! I'm afraid ! God ... if you exist ... grant me a little peace. Grant me a little peace. Oh, God. God. What mystery ! What beauty ! No, I can't go back ! I don't want to. They're horrible. It's all horrible. They don't know what they're doing ... but I'm even worse. I'll save you ... my child. God ! My God ! Help me ! Give me the strength ... the understanding ... and the courage ! God ! My God ! Merciful God ! God ! God ! God ! God ! God !
