Divine! You've outdone yourself Ophelia, really exquisite! Thank you Drusila, that's exactly what I needed to hear. I love being on this side of the wiring. Where did you get that idea? I wanted the audience to know what it feels like to be a model. To be trapped in a shop window without escape. Alexis has been in the bathroom for 20 minutes. Half an hour I would say. Listen! I read an article about girls that spend all day in the bathroom. The main reasons are two, eating disorders... Or drugs. Eva, Irene, you are next, Let's go! Hey girl, you know what everybody's saying? That you spend too much time in the Bathroom. If you want to keep your job don't talk to me and just do my hair. Sorry Alexis, your hair is already done. Alexis there's 20 minutes to the end of the show Are you ready for your make-up? Yes, and you are... Cristina. Anyway, I won't remember your name. Yes. These are from your brother. He wants to say hello. Chrysanthemums... What do I tell him? To wait. Like everybody else. Ok... Barbara! Alexis is ready! So, when Lucia told me I was gonna do your make-up I was thrilled! I know you are not allergic to any make-up. Only the cheap ones. You have no idea how many girls have that problem. And lately some guys too! - Yeah... your name... - Barbara. Excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom to fix up my make-up. But I was waiting for 25 minutes because you were in the bathroom. Besides, I'm doing your make-up Alexis! Girls I'm enchanted with you! Such runway divas! Lucia knows how to choose her girls wisely. Eva, you should try platinum blonde. You would look so European! And you Irene, look just like Elvira Hancock. Alexis is a living nightmare! Maybe she hates me? She hate us all! Don't worry, you will get used to her. Just take a cup of coffee. Thank you very much! Be careful! It's very hot. There are snacks over there, ask Cristina if you need anything else. Oh! Thank you so much! Well! I'm ready for my make-up! So you keep doing your little things on my face. Well, I will finish then. Finish quickly because... Don't you want a beer? Go get me a beer! Alexis I need to finish your make-up. Yeah, yeah! Please close your eyes. Yes, which one? Both, and keep them shut. Shut and quiet. Alexis I need you to stay still. Well. I need to calm myself down. Alexis, 5 minutes! Barbara, please! Alexis, do you want me to call someone? I can't do your make-up like this. What are you saying, you moron? I'm saying that it's impossible to do your make-up if you act like this. The only drug addict here is you. Anyone can tell! Take this trash away now! Don't you worry. I'm leaving right now. My dignity is worth more than being humiliated by this person. Person? I'm Alexis Carpenter, you mortician make-up artist! I'm sure you do dead people's make-up. Take all your bloody stuff right now! Of course I will, and also three things you don't possess. Education, respect and dignity. Are you insane? What have you done? Alexis! Let me see. Alexis! Get a doctor! Get a doctor! What is she doing? For God's sake! Someone do something! Please! Get an ambulance! Good evenight, I'm Manny Fandel to bring you the news. Still in shock by the tragic news of yesterday. The death of the one and only top model Alexis Carpenter. Was it a technical failure? Did someone throw a cigarette at her? Was the fabric of the dress not good for this kind of runway? We only know that Alexis Carpenter is gone. Mister Director, the titles please. "ATTILA PRESENTS THEIR NEW MODEL ALEXIS CARPENTER." "ELEGANCE HAS NO TIME" "¡THESE WOMEN KILL IT!" "MILLIONS OF EYES JUDGE ME." CRYSTAL EYES A month has passed since Alexis Carpenter's tragic death. According to all the examinations done by the police... Alexis herself was the culprit of her own death. She was under the influence of drugs and alcohol. She didn't know what she was doing and there was no time to help her. "THE DEATH OF ALEXIS CARPENTER" "TRAGIC DEATH OF A SUPERMODEL" "HER SUCCESSORS?" "I'M DEVASTATED" "DRUGS AND ALCOHOL" "WHAT IS LUCIA HIDING?" "ATTILA EDITORIAL VS CARPENTER FAMILY" "LOSING IS NOT IN MY BLOOD" It's been almost a year since the tragic death of Alexis Carpenter. And the Editor-in-chief of Attila Magazine, which made her famous... Decided to pay homage to her. How...? We are going to jail for this, Hernan. If they caught us we can say we were buying a gift. Laugh all you want but hurry up. We are doing something very important, Matias. Think about Alexis. They want to use her to make money, sell magazines... C'mon, let's go. Which are her dresses? Those two. Hurry up, I have a bad feeling about this. Wait for me outside, I will grab the dresses and we go home. Ok, but hurry up. Ok sister, now they will leave you alone. What the hell is this? Matias? Matias! Mati! Mati? No! Why is he taking so long? Are you finished... No! No! No! No! No! No! What happened to you, Hernan! Now that the wardrobe disappeared, is the campaign canceled? You really think this embarrassing complot can stop Lucia I'uccello? Girls! You hardly know me! My little girls. Sorry Miss Lucia, I didn't... It's not your fault Irene, being young and stupid often goes together. My designer Anton is working on the dresses since dawn. Nadia, Nidia, bring him. Thank you. Anton is magnificent. Efficient and fast like a bullet. He duplicated Alexis' stolen dresses in a couple of hours. By the way, he wants to take some measurements to finish his "work of art". Sorry for interrupting you, Miss Lucia. I want to know which one of us will play Alexis' role in the cover. The cold and distant Eva Lantier, who only speaks to make her colleagues uncomfortable. That path can take you far in this industry. Or just the opposite, of course. The plan remains the same, girls. You shall wear the same dresses, the same backdrops. The same number of shots and frames. But... The cover girl shall be revealed once the photographs are developed. I suggest you make an effort, my darlings. The special edition in honor of Alexis Carpenter's death is not an every day occurrence. Poor Alexis... Irene! As the Editor-in-chief of the most important fashion magazine in Buenos Aires, I will give you this advice: Never use the word "poor". Never! Under any circumstance! And also Irene... Why "poor" Alexis? Have you forgot the fight you had with Alexis... When you did that show in Las Leñas? Alexis despised you, she hated all of us regardless. I don't deny your beautiful face, but your lowly genes can be seen from miles away. Miss Lucia says it seems you were born in a manger. How funny! Isn't it? Here I go! And you Eva, don't you want to share a story of your own about Alexis? Get this Eva, there can only be one Cover Girl. Being blonde is a birthright. Your wheat colored hair doesn't get you in my league. Of course not, Miss I'uccelo. She was a great colleague. Just as you must remember her as a dear student. Lucia open up! I'm just asking for a little money! Open the gates! Do you want all of your neighbours to know that you sell magazines only because of me? Open up, Lucia! Being a villainess is not a trend so try something else. Ok, finishing this friendly reunion I hope we can rise to the occasion to pay homage to our dear Alexis. With a beautiful smile. The magnificent Anton! Good afternoon, ladies. What could we do without you? An applause for Anton! Enough. Thank you. It was a challenge to finish this work in such little time. And thank you to trust in me, Miss Lucia. You have nothing to thank me for. You two should go to Anton's atelier and finish fixing the gowns. I'm fine with it. At what time do you need the dresses? Oh that's true! I forgot to tell you about that. The location owners has to leave at 10PM and they will return at 1AM. So we will meet there at midnight, as we have two copies of the key. Nadia, Nidia, show them the door. See you at the midnight show. The dresses will be perfect, ladies. Sorry I can't give you a ride, but I have to finish some details. See you at location in exactly... 3 hours, 43 minutes. Not one minute longer! Eva Lantier, the cold and distant supermodel... Who only talks to make their colleagues uncomfortable. Ursula and Greta, the models that used to be successful. But ended up out of business because of a shameful scandal. Living with your best friend should not be a problem. Right, Greta? I think the same, Ursula. Why don't you tell us about the special edition? As good as it gets girls, everything is running on high-heels. Aren't you worried? What are you talking about? Aren't you afraid something happens? Don't you remember what happened to Grace when...? I don't know how Irene and you dared to do this. What happened to Grace? She had to leave the agency. Alexis appeared in her nightmares all the time. But Miss Lucia kept it a secret. Ofelia suffered the same fate! She moved to Rome, near the Vatican, as she woke up in the middle of the night... Hearing Alexis' screams and that burnt smell... Everyone speaks about Alexis' ghost and curse. I can't believe you never heard anything about it. We all felt something after her death. Girls, I don't care about Alexis' ghost or any curse. I only know I'll be the next Cover Girl. And that's all that matters. I'm off. Go ahead Eva, I hope everything keeps running on high-heels. Thanks you! Bye! Eva! I know we were not close friends. But I really hope everything goes well. Watch your step! Stupid! Lucio, you scared me! I'm sorry, Miss Del lago, I didn't mean it. It's ok. - Please get in. - Thank you. You can call me Irene, Lucio. Thank you Miss Irene, thank you. I'm sorry, we had a little inconvenience. Lucio we are going up! Yes Miss, we had a problem in the basement. One of the main pipelines is broken. We moved your car to the second floor, don't you worry. But we are going up. That's because the exit of the elevator got flooded. That's why you have to use the service stairs. The service stairs? Go ahead, please. We are here. Sorry I can only accompany you this far, the stairs are not my thing. Lucio, you are a sweetheart. Thank you! And wish me luck, if everything goes well I will be the next Cover Girl. See you later! Best of luck, Miss Irene! I will open the gate right away! Lucio! Lucio! What's this? Lucio! No! Noooo! No! No! Please no! No! Till Monday, Miss Irene! I love you. Anton, don't be mad, I thought one applause was enough. Besides, it was a warm applause. Ok, ok, but don't get mad. Relax my dear, see you later. My God! Just what I needed! Who's there? Who's there! I said who's there! Who dares to... L'uccello Residence. No, this is Nadia. Yes, Miss Lucia is still at her office. I will let her know, until later, Mister Anton. L'uccello Residence. No, this is Nidia. No, I didn't know you spoke to her. I understand. I will let her know. Until later, Mister Anton. Nadia? Nadia? Where are you? Where...? Nidia... Nidia... Nadia! Nadia! The night always improves my walk. I can follow you and you won't find out. Maybe you won't believe what I'm capable of. Staring at your shadow, with every step I come closer. Eyes and mirrors, my biggest weakness. They will reflect a silver light. I'm always smiling under the mask. I feel your fear, your eyes will scream! It was never my idea, to dress as the night. And to take a blade for a ride! I must have seen something with my Crystal Eyes! Once it is done, I'm not able to stop! I feel the moon whispering my name! The Cold Doll was invited to dance! Becker, look what you have done! Darling! I know it was not on purpose. This little baby knows Mamma is about to leave! Mamma is gonna be the Cover Girl. And she has a surprise that will shock everyone. I must have seen something with my Crystal Eyes! Once it is done, I'm not able to stop! I feel the moon whispering my name! The Cold Doll was invited to dance! The Cold Doll with her Crystal Eyes. - Good night, Miss. - Anton! You scared me to death! Miss Eva! I didn't recognize you with that hair colour. My apologies. Don't worry, not even my cat recognized me. You also changed your look. How did the dresses turn out? You already rang the doorbell? Yes, but no one answered. We can use my key. How weird Miss Lucia and her nieces haven't already arrived. You really think Miss Nadia and Miss Nidia are her nieces? Everything is so quiet. Miss Lucia, we are here! Is someone here? It seems we are the first ones. That seems to be the case, Miss Eva. I'm here at your disposal. I'm Mrs. Garner. Welcome to the Inner Circle. Good night, Mrs. Garner. I'm Anton Dubois, and she's Eva Lantier. Nice to meet you. Good evening. We thought the building was empty. That's why you have our extra key. Are you gonna wait for the rest of the crew here? Or do you want to go to the Main Stage? Do you want to go? Let's go, Anton. Then follow me, please. We have arrived to the Main Stage. Everything is ready for you to feel at home. If you need, me ring this bell. I will come right away. Thank you. You are very kind, Mrs. Garner. How are we gonna know when the rest arrive? We rang the bell... I haven't heard the doorbell at all. I rang it twice! It may be the storm. Maybe the wind damaged the wiring. I will be at the front door. Unless you need me here, of course. Excuse me. After you miss Eva. This place is wonderful! This building dates back to the late 1800's. The cream of the crop gathered here... For the balls the Inner Circle used to organize. I can imagine it. Let me tell you that dyeing your hair to emulate Miss Alexis, Is very daring and impressive. Thank you Anton. I wasn't very sure. But the words from Miss Lucia helped me make the decision. "This is not an every day occurrence". It seems we are not alone. Miss Lucia, is that you? It must be Irene, making an entrance. I finally found you! Sorry I'm late! Barbara! What a surprise! Eva! I didn't recognize you! Lucia didn't tell you I was coming? Anton, how are you? Very well, Miss Barbara, I'm glad to see you. What a beautiful place! It's just the three of us, so far. How unusual of Lucia, she's always on time. Maybe the storm delayed everyone. It didn't delay me. Who's everyone? Her assistants, Nadia and Nidia... The photographers... The unpunctual model Irene Del lago. All familiar faces. It seems as if Miss Alexis have gathered us. Well, I will ask Mrs. Garner for a phone. I'm worried Miss Lucia isn't here yet. I will try to contact her. It's fine, Anton. Eva, do you want to start? Yeah! I'm so eager to do so! Are you allergic to any kind of make-up? No. You have no idea how many girls have bad reactions to cheap make-up. And lately some boys too! Oh, no! I can't believe it! It's not a blackout, there's light in the stage and upstairs. Mrs. Garner said the wind messed the power lines up. And that's why the doorbell wasn't working. Let's find Mrs. Garner, then. Oh! She gave me this bell to call her. I don't think she can hear a bell in such a huge place. Let's grab our things and go. That's perfect. See! There's light in here, too. I'm here, ladies. I heard you call me. Mrs. Garner, we were looking for you! We don't know what happened. All the lights went out. It must be an electrical issue. We need a place with a mirror and good lighting. She has to do my make-up. You can use my residence. I will lead you there. Was Anton able to reach Miss Lucia? I can't say, the last time I saw Mister Dubois he was with you. He was looking for a phone. It's a big building to wander around without knowing it. What is this place? I'm sorry, the only way to get to my residence... Without going outside is through these tunnels. Like a secret passage! Follow me please. We have arrived, the place is ready. The room is well lit and has a mirror like you asked. I will find Mr. Dubois and will keep guard on the front door. I don't want anyone to keep waiting outside. Yes, of course. If you need me, you know what to do. Thank you. Shall we start? All done! You look beautiful. In record time! I love it! I didn't had to do much work, with those features you have... Barbara? I'll be fine. I just need to take a deep breath. Are you fine? Do you need anything? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's a sudden, intense pain, but it's temporary. It's like having an invisible fist opening and closing inside my head. I have some aspirins in my purse if you need. I'm fine. I will go to the kitchen to make a hot coffee, do you want some? It's freezing in here. Eva... That blond hair suits you so well, way better than Alexis. I really hope you are the next Cover Girl. This storm can't augur anything good. I hope I'm wrong. Ladies? What game are they playing? Miss Eva, I finally found you! I don't want to scare you, but I am myself. What's going on, Anton? It's been almost an hour, and no one has come. I'm afraid something bad has happened. And that's not all. I found a phone, but the line has been disconnected. And I can't find Mrs. Garner anywhere. The phone may not work because of the wind. It's not that the phone is not working. The cable has been literally cut. Ok, let's wait for everyone at the entrance... It wasn't your intention but you managed to scare me. Let's find Barbara and get out now. I agree. Barbara? Barbara! But, she's not here! Where can she be? Miss Barbara, where are you? Mrs. Garner! Mrs. Garner! I'm leaving right now, Anton! I will go with you, Miss. Stop it with the "Miss" thing, please! Mrs. Garner! Mrs. Garner, this is very urgent! It's locked! I left the keys in the stage with the gowns! Wait here, I will get them! I found the keys, Miss Eva! My God! Anton! Anton? Anton? What's going on, Anton? Anton? D'ion, pleasure of the Gods. I'm sure Lucia didn't give me the money because of Eva Lantier. That newbie surely talked trash about me. I hate her! She told me I was in a bad shape. The bitch asked me if I was taking pills. Anyway, I don't care. I'm Alexis Carpenter. The best. Irene! Who's there? Who is it!? You bitch! Miss Eva! Anton! Hang in there! I'll get help! Don't worry about me, Miss Eva. I'm already dead. But the mannequin is alive! Who are you!? Who are you!? Get closer if you dare! No! Matias? Matias, what are you doing? It's me, Eva! I'm Eva, Matías. Eva, Eva... Long time no see... Matias, please! Matias? I see you are in a really bad shape, Eva. Are you taking any kind of pill, or something like it? Alexis? Yes Eva, I'm Alexis. The one you always tried to imitate... But couldn't, not even while I was dead. Matias, you are not Alexis! Look yourself in a mirror! No! No! No! Hernan! No! No! No! Hernan! What happened, Hernan? No! You shouldn't fear death, Eva. There's nothing to worry about it. Don't I look better than ever? Please, no! Everything will go according to your plan. You will be the next Cover Girl. And no one will take that away from you! Alexis! Alexis! Alexis, it's been a while. A year, right? I was looking for you, I need to finish your make-up. The mortician make-up artist is finally here... I was also looking for you... To kill you! Everyone is waiting for you, Alexis. Everyone wants to see the great Alexis Carpenter again. You are closing the runway show, Alexis. The press still says you are the best model of them all. No one will ever get your throne. You death people's make-up artist. That's what you are! I only love you, my brother. Only you, not even Hernan or mom. Only you. Freeze! You are too late, too late! We are outside the Central Hospital to report about a terrible crime. Seven people were murdered. They all belong to Atilla, Lucia I'uccello's fashion magazine. You surely remember Alexis Carpenter, the famous top model. She died burnt alive while closing a runway show. Matias Carpenter would be one of the victims found at the historic building... Where a photo shoot was going to take place. The culprit was caught by the police. According to our information, the killer is a 30 year old woman. We are waiting to found out the identity... So, the patient they brought before... Oh no, what a horror! I told you that didn't look like a car crash. You think it's true? What? That the killer is a woman. It seems like the ladies have no work to do. I'm sorry doctor, we were... We wanted to... Girls I understand, but this will be a very difficult night. Annie, you know how to handle the press if they call. Susie, go and check if the x-rays from the new patient are ready. Is he... Alexis Carpenter's brother? Our job is to protect our patient's well-being. Whoever he is. That's why I have told you a hundred times not to watch the news during your shift. Central hospital... - Good night doctor. - Good night. Poor boy, my God. This is terrible. Here are the x-rays, doctor. Thank you. Matias? Water... Water, please. Matias, it's so good you woke up. I'm doctor Alves. You are in the Central Hospital. How do you feel? My head... it hurts a lot. I will give you a painkiller. What happened? You got hit very hardly, but your life is out of danger. No, what happened with my sister? I'm so sorry, doctor. I will give you a painkiller, it will relax you as well. You need to rest from that blow. I will be right back. - Susana! - Yes. Susana? Susana? Susana? Don't worry, doctor. We feel perfectly fine. CRYSTAL EYES
