Chuck and Mae's Family Restaurant: Where a slice of heaven is in every plate. - I can't see anything. - Stay with me. Base, base, we're heading to the lab. Let's keep moving. Base, base, can you hear me? We've moved out of corridor H, and we're headed up the elevator. - You alright? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Let's keep going. Keep moving. Go left, go left. This way. Upstairs, let's go. Keep moving, keep moving. C'mon. Ma'am, are you okay? How badly are you hurt? - What happened? - Explosion. Nitrogen oxide spilled. Sulfur dioxide is airborne. What does that mean? Clear the area. Toxic corrosive level will kill all. What do we do? How do we fix it? It's over. - She's dead. - Over here, they're all dead. Dammit. The lab exploded. God help us. It's airborne, we need to clear out. This just in, the governor has ordered all citizens in the surrounding area to stay indoors for the next 48 hours. Please, stay inside and stay safe. We will bring you more as the story unfolds. Hey, Chuck, don't you hear the phone ringing? Good morning, Chuck and Mae's. How can I help you? Yes, we're open. Of course, we're open. They just called, you answered. Hello. We're open. Toxic acid rain is on its way to the south shore of Long Island, as a direct result of a chemical explosion that occurred this morning at Fort Johnson military base, leaving 27 people dead and 12 soldiers wounded. The governor has ordered that all citizens stay inside for the next 48 hours or until the dangers of the rain passes. Weather is up after these messages. Hey, the news said the explosion this morning was causing the weather to be a bit screwy. Um, and to expect acid rain? Ricardo, where's my garbage can?! Just hope they don't try and tell us to evacuate the city. I mean, it's always a problem trying to get people from here to listen. Besides being short man power, pain in the ass. Well, when are you guys closing up shop? Supposed to be next week. Just don't know how... I mean, they already reassigned most my staff. - That's crazy. - Where's this woman? I got table one, I got table two up there, and what's she got there? She's talking to the cop again? Of course, she's talking to the cop. I have seven bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches with mayo. One P&J. And for Nina, I got the tofu scramble, soy bacon, soy cheese, with nutritional yeast on gluten-free bread. And also an extra sandwich in there for the lieutenant. Thank you. And say hello to Chuck for me. - Mae! Pickup! - I will. And that'll be $40. And I put extra napkins and ketchup in there for the doc. I know he always asks, but you should watch him eat. It's actually pretty comical. The man never uses any napkins. Thank you, Mae, I'll see you tomorrow. Alright, we'll see you tomorrow. The flower looks nice. Thank you. Be safe out there. Every day. Where you been? - Cop again? - Sarge. Please. Take this out there. If I hear this guy yell about his food one more time... He's sweet. - Who's sweet? The cop? - Yeah. Uh-huh, sweet. Whoop-diggity-diablo. That's why I'm going to Atlantic City this weekend by myself. Hugs and squeezes! Over 10,000 Queens residents have signed a petition in order to request that the entire structure be granted landmark status in New York City. As of now, the theater remains vacant since its closure in 1980... Next week marks the... ...the anniversary of the Civil War. - We will be casting live... - Okay, wait stop. - ...from the historic site of Gettysburg. - There she is. The lovely and beautiful Gerri Tauver. - Suffolk County residents... - Who's that? Reporter. Don't move, it's perfect. Ah, damn, Malloy, you had it! I'm not... I'm just not getting this, Lieutenant. Uh... You know what, maybe it's the acid rain. Huh? But, seriously, maybe we could just requisition a new one. You know, a five-screen, 75 inches. You got jokes this morning. Just fix the TV. Hey, hey, kids. Daddy's home. There he is. With my favorite. Yeah, I got your two. Toss 'em up, man, I'm hungry as hell this morning. That's... yours. I could eat a horse. Hey, don't say that around Rossi. - Why not? - She's vegan this week. Vegan. You're on a roll this morning, huh? I wouldn't mind if they were actually funny. Hey, Dash, you get that report back from the doc yet? No, not yet. I'll ask him when I give him his sandwich. Alright. Please, follow up with that. I want everything nice and tight when McQueen brings Gallo in. Alright, will do. Yes, sir. This is a piece of shit. I don't think it's this. I think it's the cable company. - Call the cable company. - They already canceled us. - What? - It'll work, man, just play with the wire. Get on it. I need to fix this. I need to find out what's going on from that explosion this morning. So pissed I have to drive all the way to Amityville for this stupid ticket! This is dumb. Hey, wait a minute, don't spend all day on that, Malloy. Still need that closet cleared. What closet? Downstairs in the morgue. Doc's been going apeshit with his lack of space. He does realize that we're merging with Central, right? You ready for this? I don't know. I've never done this before. I don't know. That's my little girl. We're gonna find the guys who did this. We-we can't let her mother see her like this. There's just some paperwork in the office that you have to fill out. I-I gotta go. I can't stay. I gotta go open the bar. Dammit, Mae. Always forgets to toast my buns. I bet she'd love to toast your buns. Hey, hey, Dashy, be a mensch, throw me my sandwich over here. - Yeah. - Better hurry up and eat that before the lieutenant grabs it. Oh, you got jokes today too. Okay, I got one. - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - You're wife. - Ex-wife. She called a few times. Hey, you guys notice the radios on the fritz? Yes, I noticed. Been like that all frickin' morning. Hm, maybe it has something to do with that acid rain. Dash, don't take too long with that, please. I need you back at the front. Flannery called out again. All these damn department cuts, so short-staffed. Well, just... Look, we get too busy we call Massapequa. Man, screw Massapequa. They always feel like we owe them something. Oh, and your wife really did call. Sounded important, you should probably call her back. Ex-wife. Alright. - Oh... - Hey, you blind? What's a matter with you? Six feet. Live it. Learn it. Ma'am, I'm sorry. I didn't see you. Obviously. You're making me claustrophobic. Where can I go to pay a ticket? Sure, the office at the front desk can assist you. You can't? Ma'am, the office at the front desk... You don't have to get pissed about it. What's wrong with people? Ma'am, I'm just trying to answer your question. You need to stop what you're doing and assist a person who needs help. Serve and protect! Right? So, serve! Unbelievable. Ma'am, maybe you should go to Central to get that taken care of. Our hub is in transition and... Never mind! Talking to you is like talking to the wall! Seriously? Mm... Hello, ma'am. Can I help you? We will see. I want to talk to someone about paying this damn ticket. Great, well, our cashier isn't in right now. She'll be in at nine. And she'll be happy to help you then. Of course! You'll be glad to take my damn money. I beg your pardon? I need to get back to the city. I have to wait until someone comes later? You're here. I'm here. Can't you do it? As I said, ma'am, I'm sorry. I have to watch the front desk. Now our front desk liaison will be in... What else can you people do to annoy me? What are you doing right now? Just watching TV and stuffing your face? I hope you get diabetes. It's just around the corner from high blood pressure. Yeah, I know. It's right around the corner from You're Being Rude Lane and Take a Seat Boulevard. Drop your weapon! Police! Don't do it! I said don't do it! Drop it! - That's how you do it. - Nice shooting, Rossi. Sergeant you scared me. I scared you? Your shooting scares me. Oh, my... Oh, that smells so good. Mae sends her very famous sandwich. One soy bacon, tofu, scrambled nutritional yeast, with soy cheese on gluten free toast for you. Yes, she made it special just for me, that's so cool. There are a lot of words that come into my head when I think of that sandwich. Cool? Yeah, definitely wasn't one of them. Oh, Sergeant, I wanted to ask you: Did you sign off on my leave? I wanna make sure I have everything in order before I head out. When did you plan on taking it? Monday. My parent's anniversary is next Friday down in Chapel Hill. Yes, yes I did. It's in your inbox. - Okay, thank you. - Yes, and remember to tell front desk so you can block out your time. Okay? Okay. It means the world to me to get to go. And there's so much to do. I mean, I still gotta get down there, gotta meet up with my family. I've gotta get fitted, get a dress... Okay. Great, is there anything else you need from me? - Nope. No. - Alright. Okay. Oh, and Rossi, when you're firing a gun, you don't need to go "blam, blam." The gun does the talking for you. Yeah, you saw that. Yes, sir. Oh, hey, Dashy. Morning, Doc. Alright, thanks. Is this the dead dancer? Uh, no, she's between the two... No, actually this is the dead dancer, you were right. I heard McQueen caught the bastard that did her in. - Yeah. - Look, he did her pretty good, huh?. - I don't know. - Looks crowded in here today. Oh, yeah. I got two on gurneys, four in the hallway, four in the freezer. I had to send six back to county. You should send most of them to county so we can start breaking this place down for the merge. That merge is gonna suck. Yeah, tell me about it. Do you want a napkin? - I got plenty. - No, I'm alright. That... that can't be sanitary. - What? - Never mind. McQueen's on his way back with Gallo. I'd really like that report today so we can slam dunk this guy. Oh, absolutely, man, absolutely. Oh, by the way, the air conditioner, uh, did you order the new one? Did you fix that closet door? Oh, you know, the closet... That door, it won't close 'cause it's swelling because of the heat. - Come again? The heat? - Uh, yeah, you know, that's what happens. The door swells 'cause of the heat and you can't close it. Okay. The bathroom's out of order. What's up with that? Uh, I don't know. Some sorta shit. - Yeah, backed up? - Yeah, backed up. Alright, I'll have Malloy take a look at it when he comes down for the closet. - Thanks. - Ira, please. Jesus! Not you, too. Uh, rigor mortis set in. Hits the nerve. You're fine. Believe me, she's dead. She ain't coming back to life. So, uh, where's Skeeter? I got his PB&J. Yo, Childs. Uh, he doesn't like to be called Skeeter anymore. - Um... - Really? Since when? Eh, I don't know. Gets in these moods. Hey, Childs your food's here. Great, I'll be right there! Good morning, Sergeant Dash. Good morning, Skeeter... I mean, Childs. How's it going Childs? Well, I'm just fine, thanks. So... Oh, thank you. Uh, what did Nina order this morning? She go back to the ham and eggs? Ah! I bet she didn't. She's a pretty tough chick. - I think she's rad. - Rad? - What the hell does rad mean? - It's abbreviated for radical. See? He knows. Whatever, you guys are idiots. - Uh, is she still on her crusade? - Yes, she is. Uh, I'll catch up with you guys later. Please, get me that report on the dancer, Doc. - Absolutely. - Please. Take the paper out of the folder, and let's see how we're doing in the pool. Ah, shit. I lost. Welcome home, Joe Gallo. Malloy... Large crowds have been seen in bizarre gatherings in local cemeteries throughout the Pittsburgh area. Police are investigating if there's a possible connection with the graveyard vandalism that's been going on throughout Pennsylvania. I'm Gerri Tauver and this WTJC News New York. Have a great day, New York. I will see you tomorrow. And we're out. Good job, everybody. Great show. Thomas, grab Gerri a bottle of water. All right, guys, let's get this going and get... Gerri, Joe Gallo's been caught. - What was that? - Yes, you heard me right. - Joe Gallo? - Joe Gallo. - Where is he at? - He's gonna be processed in Amityville. Okay. I want to cover that story. Alright, I'll see you in a few. On my way right now. God, this place is falling apart. Jimmy? What's up, kid? What's going on? Where's-where's your mother? She left. What do you mean she left? I don't understand. Her and Beau went away for the weekend. What? She just dumped you off and took off? Yup, and she said she tried to call you, but of course, as usual, you didn't answer. This is... - Roy... - Carrie, how you just gonna drop the kid off without even talking to me? I'm at work. We're moving stations. You know that. I'm busy, and you go off with your boyfriend... Just deal with it. Bye. Perfect. She didn't answer. I knew she wouldn't. Did you eat breakfast? Not hungry. Okay, let me see, who can I call so... - you're not bored? - I'm not bored. I can help you out around here if you'd like. Remember like last time I was here? Just give me a second to think, kid. Um... I just... I just wish things could go back to the way they used to be with us. Sorry if I ruined your weekend. No, no, it's not your fault, kid. It's not. I just didn't expect you to be tossed in my lap like this. I feel like that's always the case though. You're either too busy or just don't want me around, I guess. Alright, let me see... I can drop you off at Nana's. That's right, today's chemo day for her. Hey, Dash! Do I disappoint you? Dash, I need you in front... Yeah, I'm coming! No, you don't disappointment me, kid. Alright, listen, stay here. Let me just figure this shit out, alright. Uh, hey, if anyone's a disappointment, I feel like it should be me. What an asshole! Yeah, that's my dad. Yep, still an asshole. Joe Gallo, the so-called "Amityville Strangler", is it true that you confessed to... What is this, your hall of shame? Man, you missed it earlier. That old lady out there, she's like "I hope you get high cholesterol..." McQueen's here. - One piggy, two piggy, three piggy. - C'mon, tell me the story! McQueen. Give me the story, McQueen. Later on, lady. Try then. - What about the dead dancer? - You should come back... Hey! What about the dead... C'mon. C'mon! McQueen are you still using excessive force? Lady, do you see any marks on this man? Look, enough. Stick with the truth. Where to with this one, Dashy? - Stick him in two. - Ha! Suits him. - Let us get a story. - Looks like a number two. Lady... Good to see you guys. Gallo, what about the victim's family? I didn't do it! - Tell me something! - You want a story? - Yeah! I do, I do! - Hey, far enough. - Hup, hup. - Detective, can we get an interview? Detective! Detective! Get your hands off me! Miss Tauver. Mrs. Tauver. Hi, Lieutenant Howie Stevenson, this is my precinct. - Hey. Yeah. - You want an interview? Okay, come talk to me. - Come follow me. - Did you get that. If you guys wanted to do an interview later... Let's go get some permission. I would've had to drive to Amityville to have all this happen. So much drama in one place. All I wanna do is pay my ticket. Yeah, I'll be back to process you. Don't worry you've got a long time to hang out in here. Thanks, Officer Sterling! You think this all a joke, don't you? Yeah. I know you destroyed all the security footage from the club. But you forgot one. The one you choked the life out of that girl for five... long minutes. The ATM machine. We've got that footage. In the end, everything comes out in the wash. - I'm innocent! - Yeah. Psst. Dumbass says what? Okay, will you at least let her know that Mel called? Okay? Okay, thanks. Local authorities say acid rain is on its way. The governor informs all citizens in the surrounding areas to stay indoors for the next 48 hours until the acid rain passes. We'll bring you more as the story unfolds. What the... Acid rain? What kind of shit is that? That doesn't even make no sense. Unbelievable. There's the big old acid rain. What the...? I know, I know, blame the weather man. Blame the weather man. But, seriously, folks, we are in for some beautiful weather, as you can see on the chart right here, later in the week. And I'm talking nothing but gorgeous sunshine. So it's gonna be really nice to experience that later in the week. However, I want to reiterate the fact that the governor has handed down a red district warning. And that's due to this unstable, uncharacteristically bizarre weather we're experiencing right now. That was due to the chemical explosion at the military base, of course. Uh, so just be careful out there, and, uh... Jim, why don't you tell us about those Wolverines last night, huh? In that three-point overtime loss. My dog coulda kicked a better field goal than that one, and Charlie has one leg. We are off the air right now, right? They heard that? Well, you know me, folks, uh, always making a joke. All right. Ah, I love the aroma of this place. Hey, Childs, can you clean out those sinks! Childs... Where are you? Eh, it's just a muscle spasm. It hit a nerve. Rigor mortis set in. Happens all the time. - All the time? - All the time. How do you do it? Experience, kid. - Oh... - Experience. All I know is he went to do a sound gig and he never came back home. Uh, Dash. One second. Mr. Cooper, this is Sergeant Dash. - Nice to meet you. - He's gonna assist you with the rest of this. Thank you for your patience. I got it. Hey, Mr. Cooper. Alright... Okay, so tell me about your brother. He's been missing about two weeks? Did he have any other names or aliases he might've gone by? - You left that out of the report. - Yeah, I-I guess, uh... He had a nickname he used in his industry, uh, he's goes by Scratch. - Scratch? - Cor... Yes, Scratch. Okay. Industry. What type of work did he do? Oh, he's in entertainment. He does sound for movies. Okay, uh, Sam, if you just have a seat over there while I run a few reports I'd appreciate it. Thanks, and, uh, where's the closest bathroom? Um, you can just go through that door right there, head down to the right, and your down on the right... Hey, you cut in line! - I was here first! - What's your issue? Go to hell, asshole! - Ma'am... - I have been waiting all day. You do not lay your hands on somebody. Can I pay this ticket already? As I told you before, yes. - But you... - This is just stupid. Your system is stupid! Ma'am, please. Have a seat and we will help you out soon. - You've said that 20 times! - Please. Thank you. Don't ever lay your hands on somebody in my station. I'll be out pinning up the new ones. Okay. - Hi, can I help you? - Hi. Yes, I'm looking for the bathroom. - Bathroom? - Yes. Right down this hallway, follow the signs, if you hit the jail cell you've gone too far. Thank you. Hey, Malloy, I need you to get those, uh, tools out of the jail area. - Hey, Brian. Morning. - Hey, doll. Hey, it's after 9:00 am! Can someone, please, for the love of God... If you just give me a minute, I'd be more than happy to help you. Help me! I mean, really. I need to get back to the city! And nobody has helped me yet. Yes, I am aware. No, no, no! Yep... - Hey, Brian... - I'm not going to sit down! - What's with her? - Oh, your typical pissed off lady. But this one's on steroids. - No! - Ma'am, our clerk called out sick today, so if you just give me five minutes, I'd be more than happy to assist you. Help me! - Ma'am... - Lady, relax. He said he'll be with you in a minute. And getting all pissy with him isn't gonna help. Karma! That's what it is. Jimmy, come back here with me, please. - Karma! - Are you done, ma'am? Is there something I can help you with? No, son, not right now. Just have a seat right there, at my desk, please. Holy shit! I hear you're going on vacation next week. Yes, I so can't wait. I'm heading home for a few days. - Nice. - Did they make coffee yet? Yeah, but it's decaf. - Why do we keep doing this? - No, no! Who keeps making decaf? I gotta talk to somebody. Ma'am, I'm just asking for a few minutes. Please, I will help you. How you been? - You've been saying that! - Please. At least somebody's happy to see me, right? Hey, stop that. Your father adores you. - Yeah. - Just look over at his wall. You're plastered everywhere, kid, it's like, the wall of Jimmy Dash. I guess. Oh, wow, he even has my Little League baseball card here. See? Go ahead with your bad self. He's got every special day, every special event. He's got it all. - Guess so. - Just look... You can come across if you want. I won't tell him. Thank you. Ah, don't worry about it. I adore Jimmy. Yeah, sometimes I just wish I could hit the restart button. You know? You can. See, I think that's why we get various days to do it right. It's almost like every day is a restart button. Oh, my God, did I just give you advice? Whoo. I believe you did, Rossi. Thank you. I am grateful. I will help with Miss Impatient over there. I'm really grateful. Good morning, ma'am. How can I help you today? - Finally! Someone. - Yeah. Can you do one sideways, too? Thank you. Oh, you look great! Twenty minutes, guys. That's all I can give you. That is all we need, Lieutenant Stevenson. Oh, please, call me Howie. - Okay. - Follow me, please. I will show you all to the holding cells. Thanks, really appreciate this. - What's this? - Peace offering. We had an extra bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. Jimmy, I know you feel... Can I get a black coffee instead of the soda? Yeah, sure. - Uh, Nina, can you... - On it. Just black? Mm-hm. You're the best. I feel like at times... you resent me. No, you need to understand something. Your mother and I, we shouldn't have happened. We're like oil and water. We just never could mesh and handle things. We always fought. Mom told me that you married her because of me. And that's why you guys always fought. 'Cause you felt trapped with her. Your mother, she told you this? Yeah. You did come as a surprise. I don't regret you, I never have, son. I tried. I tried my hardest to make things work with your mom. We just... we never got along. We just constantly fought. Oh, Malloy, I need you to start on that closet in the morgue. I'd like to finish that by today. You got it, boss. You say I came as a surprise? Is that why you left me? No, I-I never left you. I left because I didn't think it was the most healthy environment to raise you in. The yelling, the fighting... Your birth... That was the best chapter of my life. I love you, boy. You're my son, that will never change. I know I missed some life events. But it was because of work, never because I resented you, ever. I'm so proud of you. I'm proud of the kid that you are and... proud of the man you'll become. I love you too, Dad. Being that we're gonna... You're gonna be here with me all day, how about you helping me out, and I, uh, throw you 50 bucks? Sixty? How about 40? Okay, I like the sound of 50. Alright. Hey, Malloy, I got a good helper for you. Hey, you listen to what he says, you do what he says. Awesome, less work for me. Let's go, kid. First we gotta stop and get the... ladder. Excuse me! Ma'am, just please calm down. - It was my fault. - Really? - I got distracted by all the commotion. - Really? I'm done! Okay, that's unnecessary. Can you go grab that woman? Ma'am, I can assist you. I'm sorry, ma'am, I can assist you. Ma'am, please come back inside, it's raining. This just in, it is no longer safe to go outside. We've never seen anything like this before. But it appears that the rain is deadly. That's right, the rain is deadly. We are officially a code red! Do not leave your homes! I warn you, do not leave your homes under any circumstance, for no reason! Do not leave your homes. - Alright, watch your back. - God, I hate coming down here. Ira! We need help. One, two, three. What happened here? - Rain, burned her. - The rain did that? Oh, that's some shit right there. - What do you want me to do? - Really, dude? You work in a freaking morgue. Get your ass up. Can you guys go upstairs, please? Authorized personnel only! Okay, get the hell outta here. Can you clean up a bit? Bandage her up, Doc? Bandages? I don't know, I think she needs to go to the hospital. You can't go outside, the rain will literally tear you apart! - Maybe even kill you, you can't. - Please, go upstairs. Please. Nobody's leaving the station, okay. God knows who or what's trapped out there in those streets. It is coming down. What the hell was that? What the hell was that? Sergeant Dash, this is Officer Nina Ross... Ser... Sergeant? Sergeant? Hello? Why is there no service?! Why is there no service? Why is there no service? Sergeant Dash, Sergeant Dash! Dash! Dash! Hi, my pretty. Is that the dancer from the Gallo case? Guys, please, back. Please, please, back, back. What... What're you doing here? - What happened to her? - Hey! Do what I asked. You don't need to be in here. Go! What're you doing? Don't make this about ratings, she needs help! No, no, no... Hey, Jimmy, have you seen my flathead - or-or my tape measure? - Nope. Hm. I know where I left 'em. I'm gonna go get them and hit the restroom first. Okay? Alright, no problem. Um, can you get me a soda? - Like a diet pop, maybe? - Sure, sure. You got it kid. Alright, thanks. Son of a bitch. Hey, guys, what's with all the commotion? She nearly got herself killed outside in the rain. She needs medical attention, Doc. Medical attention? How? I'm a morgue technician. - Help me. - Oh, my God. Help me. Take this off her. - This burns! - Go wash your hands, kid. Out of order! Son of a bitch! We don't know the extent of what it can do. Well, we know it burns your damn skin. Looking at this woman's face, I'd say the rain has turned into a high corrosive form of hydrochloric acid. Um, should wipe everything down with water. It should've been you. You shoulda been the one who vanished. Not Steve. You're worthless. You can't hold down a job... relationship. I hate being you. Maybe I should go see Father Michael... Son of a bitch, it burns! Move! Officer, are you okay? Out of order! I need water! I need water! Doc, please help her. I can't, Dashy, she's dead. Ah, damn it. Who is she? Some woman who came to pay a ticket. I guess we can dismiss that. Wow. - Water, water, it burns! - What's wrong? Are you okay? Officer? Officer... Are you alright? Oh, Lord. Oh, thank God, you're still alive. Everyone in our viewing audience, this is a dire situation. I repeat, a dire situation. Heed the governor's warning and stay inside. We've never seen anything like this, ever in the New York metropolitan area. This is a full lockdown. I repeat, a full lock... Are... Bob? Are-are... okay. Yeah, we're-we're still on. We're still on, ladies and gentlemen, we're here to let you know this is a full lockdown. I repeat, a full lockdown. Anyone outside should get indoors as quickly as possible. Indoors as quickly as possible. Lucy? Bob, Lucy just fell down. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I repeat, a dire situation. Get inside and spread the word and stay tuned. The governor has issued a full lockdown in effect. You've gotta stay inside, you've gotta heed the warning all over the New York metropolitan area. Do... do... do we still have pow... So, what happened to your camera? Uh, the battery died, so I guess I need a new one. - Got ya. - Yeah. - Pardon our mess. - Oh, it's fine. We're merging precincts, I'm sure you know. Joe Gallo. Miss Tauver here would like a moment of your time. Hope you're not busy. Um, I will get you all a chair. - We're good. - You sure? Yeah, but we would like that 20 minutes. Twenty minutes. And be sure to stay at least two feet away from the cell. And I'm gonna trust the two of you all to make your way back to the front when you're done. Got it. - Thank you, Lieutenant. - You're welcome. And Howie, please. Mm-hm. Make sure you stop by my office before you all leave. Okay. Joe Gallo... are you ready for us? I'm always ready. Good. Hey, Childs, a little bit of flashlight or something. I don't wanna be bumping into shit all day. Well, I'm trying. Where are those candles from last week? I can't see shit. Oh, never mind. - I found a lighter. - Good, great. Great, use the lighter to find the flashlight. Alright! Ira, Willy, you there? Childs, John Childs. I tried everything. All the equipment is dead. Is it because of the rain? Cable, phones, radio. Childs. John Childs. Ira, Willy, you there? What're you digging for? That lighter was mine, by the way. - Just joking. - Please. Being all the lines are down, I was looking for a prepaid phone, you know? A burner phone? Yeah, yeah, a burner. They would get service. - Try this one. - You have a burner? It-it's a work phone. Ira, anyone in the morgue? Malloy... You went outside? - Your shirt's wet. - No shit. I just peaked out the side door. - How is it? - Hot as a bitch out there. Rain is boiling hot, man. Some biblical shit. - You hear from, Ira? - No. The phone's dead. It seemed to let me text my friend Seth. I'll see if he replies. Did you hear from him? It's only been like ten minutes. Hey, Rossi. Do me a favor and go get the TV people from their interview. The deal was for 20 minutes. Man, I ain't never seen no shit like this. Man, this is... worse than the time we were all locked down for quarantine from the virus. Yeah. I was told that there was three dead women by you. - Joe Gallo, how do you feel? - I'm innocent. How do you feel about all this? What's going on through your mind? - How do you feel? - Go to hell. I wanna talk to my lawyer. You seem like you really don't care. You seem relaxed about all of it. We deserve to hear what's going. I'm innocent. Pico... Pico... Pico, you need to get the shot. What the hell was...? Miss Tauver? This is Officer Nina Rossi. I repeat, this is Officer Nina Rossi. Can anyone hear me? Dash? Can anyone hear me? Is someone in the bathroom? This is Officer Nina Rossi. I repeat, is someone in the bathroom? Where is Joe Gallo? What did you do with Joe Gallo?! Where is Gallo? What did you do with Gallo?! He was trying... I don't know... I understand. I understand. I understand! I need you to drop the screwdriver, and put your hands above your head. - I can't! - Put your hands above your head for me, okay? Who is that? Who is... Who is that? What'd stupid say? You boys alright in here? Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. Alright, you're good. What's going on out there? Oh, nothing. We just lost a little bit of power. We should be back on in a minute. - Uh, where's Malloy? - Uh, bathroom? - Yeah, yeah. Alright. See ya. - Alright. Thunder scare you, too? - Scare who? - You. Motherfucker, I ain't scared of shit. C'mon, c'mon... I think we need a new coffee pot. This one's broke. What the hell? Guys, there's something in here with us. What do you mean? I said there's something in here with us. Something we're not sure of? No, it was right here! I mean, we have rats in the station at night. I've seen 'em. They're-they're big, like small cats. What the hell is that? That's no rat. - That-that's... - Where'd it go? Did you see it? You see it? Yes. Looked like a dead guy coming right at me. Childs! Hey-hey, Childs. Rossi! C'mon. C'mon, c'mon. Jimmy, Jimmy! C'mon, c'mon. Come in. Rossi. Jimmy. Malloy, can you hear... Rossi... - Dad. - Jimmy! Hello? This is crazy, man. Clearly we need to find out what that was, that thing. That thing was a man, okay? That guy, that-that thing... He came in this morning, filed a missing person's report, and he didn't look like that! Guys, my van's in the alley way. We can go right out the back door. We aren't going anywhere until we figure out and catch that thing that's in here with us. Okay, Detective? Alright, we need to clear the station and head down to the morgue. We grab my son, grab the others, and head out to the alley way. Guys, screw the alley way, okay. Look at my arm. That is acid rain that's coming down, and it's pouring right now. We need to stay here! Okay? Catch that thing, protect the precinct! Howie, Howie, something is godly wrong. How'd that guy turn into that... I have no idea, okay. The explosion maybe? The rain? Okay, okay, okay. What's your plan, Sergeant? Like I said before, we clear the station and go get my boy. Any luck on the radio? Rossi. - Rossi. - Oh, damn, Rossi. I... she left a while ago to get the TV people. From the interview. - Interview? - Yes. - Gallo? - Yes! Jesus Ch... Really? We need to get out of this room, like now. At least try to find some place to go make a call for help. Yeah, I'd love to hear that call. Yeah, this is Amityville station three. Yeah, we're under siege by zombies. Yeah, we need help. I said zombies. What the hell, man? Are you finished, Detective? Yes, I am, Lieutenant. Sorry, this town brings out the best in me. Alright, I'm going to get my boy. - Dash, wait! - No, no, don't wait, Howie! I'm going to get my son. He's my responsibility. Yes, but what's your plan to go when you get out there, Dash? Okay? I mean, we don't even know if... Really?! Do not even think like that. When's the last time you talked to him? Uh... What're you doing here? - What happened to her? - Hey! Do what I asked. You don't need to be in here. Go! Dash! C'mon, man, you mean to tell me while all this shit's been going down you haven't checked on your son? This shit has just started going on! But that's your son. Look, I've been a shit father his entire life, man. I know that. I mean, that's not how I had it planned. I had to get me cleaned up. Had to get me straight before I'd be responsible for him. And I screwed up with him. I'm going to get my boy. - Stay here, Detective. - Yeah, the hell I am. - Okay. - Guys ready? Yes! Yo, Childs. Childs. Dash? You were dead! You were dead! Jimmy, is Malloy still with you? No. He stepped out a while... I don't know. - Jimmy! - Dad... I hear something outside the door. Is that you? - No, no, no. - No, Jimmy. - Tell him to stay put. - Jimmy, stay put. Stay quiet. Dad? Jimmy! I think it's Dr. Ira. I'm gonna go peak out the door. No! No, tell him to stay put. Jimmy, stay put. Stay quiet. Do not go in the morgue. Jimmy, stay... Jimmy... Jimmy! - Let's go. - McQueen, let's move. Ah, shit. There's more blood over here. Whose keys and gun is that? I'll check. Shoot him in the head. Whose damn keys are they? That's two that look like that. Rossi's keys. Gallo was probably trying to use her to get out. Probably thinking the same thing we are. Down and out through the morgue. This is unfreaking real, man. I just killed a dead guy. Can anyone hear me on this? - Jimmy? - Dad? - Oh, thank God. - It's a good thing. Hey, let's move. Let's go, let's go. - Jimmy. - Dad. Jimmy, I'm coming for you. Okay, we got confirmation, Sergeant. Let's go get your boy. Come on, guys, let's do this. Move, move. McQueen. Wait, wait, wait.... What'd you see, LT? Can't see shit, but I... I hear something. It's getting closer. What the fu... What the... Is he dead? Yeah. You okay? Yeah, just awesome! C'mon, let's go, we gotta move. Yeah, just give me a minute, pard. I'll tell you this, she-she's definitely not a vegan. Let's go, let's move. Come on. Let's do it. Nice shot, man. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No. I just killed Malloy. Brother, he-he was already dead. What the fuck is going on? Hey, hey... We need to go get your boy, okay? C'mon, bud. Jimmy... - Dammit! - Did you really think that was gonna work? No, but the damn emergency light should be on. My batteries are starting to go out on this. Shh, shh, I can hear something. Get on the ground! Get down! Drop the sledgehammer. Get on the ground! There are zombies here and you're harassing me? I'm innocent, don't you understand? I didn't do it. I'm not one of them. I'm one of you! You're not one of us. You're a broken part of the system. And you got out while over a dozen women lost their lives. Get the hell out of here. But I'm Joe Gallo! Alright. Jimmy? The door... we never fixed it. He was never safe. No! No! Oh, my God. Dash, we need to go now! Dash, we need to get out of here!
