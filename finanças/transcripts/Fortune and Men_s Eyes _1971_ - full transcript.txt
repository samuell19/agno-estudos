Look, we don't have a lot of time and I'd like to ask you a question. Now, I know you don't smoke and yet you spend half your goddamn time just rolling smokes for that turd. Why? - Can you hear him? We're buddies. - Why you made that mistake? When you first came in here, I said to myself "Miss self, there's a man, a man who's gonna wanna be on top - Of what? - Of everything - What am I supposed to do? You pick me an oldman? - Look, you don't have to punk for Rocky, unless you dig it. Now, I know he's got a few friends honey, but my friends can take care of the storeroom crowd and you gotta prove yourself in here, baby. I can go out there and tell everybody you're ruling here, goddammit!

Oh...God... ♫ When in disgrace ♫ ♫ with fortune and men's eyes ♫ ♫ I all alone ♫ ♫ beweep my outcast state, ♫ ♫ And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, ♫ ♫ And look upon myself and curse my fate, ♫ ♫ Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, ♫ ♫ featured like him ♫ ♫ like him with friends possessed, ♫ ♫ desiring this man's art and that man's scope, ♫ ♫ With what I most enjoy contented least; ♫ ♫ for thy sweet love ♫ ♫ remembered such wealth brings ♫ ♫ that then I scorn ♫ ♫ to change my state with kings. ♫
