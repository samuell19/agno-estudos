[music playing] [vocalizing] NARRATOR: People often speak of worlds beyond the stars. Focused above, they forget to look down. What would happen if they search beneath the Earth? Would they find only darkness waiting in the depths, or would they find something beyond imagination? In ancient times, kings built soldiers of stone. Over the centuries these soldiers, stood lifeless, waiting in the immortal darkness, unchanged by time. Their spears stayed sharp and their armor hard. They stood ready, forever waiting, until one day, light pierced its way into the darkness and brought life to what once was stone. Welcome to the world of Terracotta. [fantastical music] Whoa, excuse me. Oh, come through. Whoa. [laughs] Magnus, where are you going, boy? Huh? Hi, Granny. [laughs] I can't tell you. But it's real important. Reckless child. Following your feet without knowing where your destination lies. I'm not lost. Thanks though. Anyway, I got to go. See you. [clanking] Master Smith, here, I brought you some more metal. So can I have a sword now? Soldiers can, but not you. Magnus, you're just an orderly. You're not allowed to have a sword. So why don't you just forget about getting one. But I really need a sword today. Wow! [sighs] What could you need a sword for? The scouts said that the tyrants are closing in. They could attack at any time. It's my chance to prove I'm a warrior. [grunts] Wake up, boy. You're going to regret getting caught with a weapon. But I-- [horn blows] They're here. Master Smith, I'll bring it back! [gasps] [frantic chatter] [suspenseful music] MAGNUS: The city is being attacked by monsters known as tyrants. They're foul looking and violent creatures. For years, the soldiers have done their best to hold the line. However, during the many battles with the tyrants, countless Terracotta soldiers have been shattered. [roars] But opportunity awaits those who are prepared. This is going to be the day that I, Magnus, contribute to Qin. [groans] No! [pants] [screams] [groans] I'm still alive? I'm still alive. [cheerful music] [grunts] Coming through! Magnus, what are you doing? I'm here to help! [screams] Get out of here, everyone. Who is that? Watch out! [groaning] [roars] [clanks] Huh? General? General! [grunts] MAGNUS (VOICEOVER): He is my role model. General Jin. He's also the hero of Qin Yang city, admired by tens of thousands of citizens. And these are the elite warriors. They're the most capable soldiers under the General's lead. One day, I will become an elite warrior and fight side by side with General Jin. [groans] They're retreating. Victory! We won! Yeah! [cheering] [soldiers chanting] As long as I'm general, those monsters will not take over our city! [epic music] [soldiers chanting] Keep the tip up. [grunting] [chatter] [cheering] Hurry up, you maggots. My grandma is faster than you slowpokes. Recruits can't enter battle. You're going to regret what you did, you little shrimp. You're pathetic. [pants] Come on, pretty boy. Stop holding us back. Now I want it'll open up finish cleaning the fields, barracks, armories, and streamers before dark. But that's impossible, sir. You dare talk back to me? [groans] Sorry. Carry those to armory now! [grunts] [gasps] He's out! Magnus! Magnus! Magnus, I can't-- I cannot believe you actually did that. What were you thinking, entering a battle? You know, they might make you fix the city walls as a punishment. Is that what you want? I guess it wouldn't be so bad fixing the city walls. I'd be closer to the battlefield. See, I told you. He lost his marbles. Hey, I just want to say, you're crazy. You need to be more careful. Ever since those scary tyrants showed up, people have been going missing. They leave and don't come back. Oh, hey, look. There's that tyrant poster again. [laughs] Why is that just his butt? Who would recognize him? Magnus, those who've seen the other side have never lived to tell about it. That's scary. I'm glad you agree. Magnus, being an orderly is much safer. Why don't you like it? And besides, you can't be elite. They're made that way. Who said that? I mean, come on, guys. General Jin used to be a low-ranking soldier. But he's so powerful and strong. I won't be an orderly my whole life. I'm not just going to be running errands all the time. I'll make it. Recruit! Yes? Polish my sword. [groans] Wow! An elite warrior sword, a symbol of bravery! I'll get one. Then I'll the elite warriors, and I'll be the one giving the orders. [laughs] Stupid recruit. [crashing] Why are you holding an elite soldier sword? It's him. He's the recruit from the battlefield. Huh? This guy? You think you're a soldier, maggot, eh? I just-- I want to fight too. Magnus-- Hah! A hero. You couldn't lift a sword. I've seen piles of dirt that can fight the tyrants better than you three. Oh, relax, man. During the fight today, the tyrants didn't seem so fierce. What's that? Huh? Huh? Elite? Almost looks like a real one. You're a recruit and you'll be one forever. [laughter] Give it back. Come on. Give it. Give it to me. [grunting] You're an embarrassment. I should crush you to dust right now. I'm not afraid of anything. I'll show you who's useless. You want to die? Stop! General. General. Fighting is not allowed in the city. General, it was the recruit's fault. That's enough. Thank you. So you want to be an elite warrior, hmm? I-- I do. There is only one test-- find the tyrant, kill the tyrant. Then you'll be a warrior. Dangerous. That is very dangerous, you know. Don't do it. This coward won't do it. I will do it. I'll take him down. So you've got a death wish. Watch out. Move it. Enjoy your last few days. Us two would have had that tyrant last time if that silly old man hadn't have gotten in our way. Oh, we were so close. [dramatic music] It was last spotted five kilometers outside the city. This place is a graveyard. Huh? Tyrants near. Hmm. Die, die! [eerie music] [sighs] [gasps] Hmm. These marks look fresh. He couldn't have gone far. [gasps] Looks like the right butt. [gasps] Hmm. [suspenseful music] [gasps] [sighs] [grunting] [grunts] Who is that? [grunts] Now's my chance. This is it. [pants] [grunts] That tyrant's mine. Huh? [groans] [screaming] [groans] Who do you think you are, attacking a Qin Soldier? Hmm? Did you never learn your manners, my boy? [gasps] My spear! I demand to know who you are. You may call me Master Nine Tails. And you are in my monolith forest. Monolith forest? Huh. I never knew this place existed before. [epic music] As you can see, this place is a library. The history of the underground is recorded here, all on my monoliths. This inscription's about Qin Yang City. Qin Yang, huh? [laughs] That city's a drop in the ocean. A drop in the ocean? You don't know what you're talking about. Qin Yang is huge. [laughs] Foolish soldier. You must broaden your vision. [gasps] Rivers flow across all the land. Come, swim with me and see, boy. Huh? The underground is a never ending expanse. Beyond your city is Han Lu, then Tong An, and Sung Jin. For centuries, the Terracotta have lived down here, completely untouched by the unrelenting passage of time. I never knew the underground world was so vast. You see? There are many things that you do not know, my boy. What's this? The tyrants? The tyrants are old spiritual animals. They eat fruit and mushrooms and live inside caves. What's that in the center? You don't know, boy? That is the creation stone. It holds the energy of the ancient creators. The tyrants need this stone's power for their offspring. Its other powers still remain unknown. I wonder-- [gasps] That's him! What's he doing? So you've met Kunlun. His breed is very rare amongst all the tyrants. So his name is Kunlun. And do you know how I can find him? You should stay away. If I catch Kunlun, I become an elite warrior. Oh, my. Is that really what you want? Yeah, of course. And then once I become elite, I get to lead the soldiers. And I'll be the one giving the orders. Hmm, foolish boy. Your eyes are open, but you're blind. [sighs] Your brain is small. Try to think of where your feet are taking you. Anything would be better than being an orderly. Nothing is ever quite as it seems to be, my dear boy. Your eyes fail you. See with your heart. Heart? All right, Magnus, it's time for you to leave now. Huh? How do you know my name? Where did you go? Where are you? Follow Dodo. She'll guide you to what you're looking for. [groans] Get off! [sighs] You're Dodo? You can help me find Kunlun? [groans] Wasn't a dream after all. Huh? You again? You. You ruined my hunt. What? But you ruin my plan first. Yet you're accusing-- huh? [groans] That's enough. [groans] Let go of me. Do you know how important Kunlun is to me? What's this? [grunting] Your Kung Fu sucks. What's your plan? OK. Your Kung Fu is great. You still haven't got him. What was that? What I'm trying to say is since both of us want to capture Kunlun, why don't we take him down together? Hmm, why would I team up with you? This is Dodo, a professional a tracking Kunlun. Hmm? [laughs] Oh, forget about it. She only follows my orders. Besides, it's quite dangerous out here. We'll watch each other's backs. How about it? Hmm. Don't slow me down. Hmm. Dodo, can you check road conditions, please? So where are you from? I've never seen an outfit like that. And I've never seen such a tiny soldier. Never judge a book by its cover. I, Magnus, am famous for fighting tyrants. Just yesterday, I was fighting, and I killed three tyrant monsters. Sure. So I haven't learned her name yet. You don't need to know. Come on. Tell me. Where are you from? You have impressive sword skills. Can you teach me? Nope. Pfft. Fine. [gasps] Jade. Oh, so your name is Jade, huh? Ow! My fingers. Don't touch my things. Come on. Hmm. [grunting] Dodo, you're supposed to take us to Kunlun. Why did you lead us here? Huh. The bronze dragon. Well, at least we've got a safe place that we can stay for the night. WOMAN: Someone help me! Watch out. Jade! Let me go! Stop! Hmm? You let go of her now! Huh? Could have sworn I heard a girl. Drop the goat? Who are you calling a girl? For all you know, I'm your father. Hmm. Go ahead. Roast him. What is all of this? What do you want? I was going to be feasting on goat tonight. But it looks like chance brought me a better dinner. [groans] What do you mean? He's going to grind you into a pill! A pill? Stone head, use your brain. All those missing soldiers, it's because of him. Is that true? The goat speaks truthfully. You two fools, your bodies are going to make many new magic pills! You're insane! Your bodies hold power. It's mine now. [laughs] Watch out! [groaning] Stop playing and fight. Jade! [gasps] Huh? Very impressive, child. [grunting] Move! [gasps] [groaning] OK, we got to hit him in the eye. Huh? Quit standing there. Get him! [grunts] Pretty lady, I'm here for you. [grunting] Huh? [screams] [gasps] [explosion] Pretty lady, this way. Lucky you got me. I was once a powerful weapon. But one day, I was turned into a goat. Then that sorcerer got me and he kept me as a pet. And he beat me. Oh, the shame. For decades, I was stuck without any hope of escaping from him. And can you imagine? You must hate me too. It was all just so tragic. But then the most beautiful woman rescued me, and she pulled me out of my misery. We're best friends now. I promise to follow you forever, pretty lady. Oh, yeah. You can go ahead and call me Shorpa. [groans] [grunts] Hah, get over yourself. You're a powerful weapon as much as I'm Kunlun's brother. Huh? Everybody stop! Watch this. I'll transform back right now. That'll teach you! OK. You've got my attention. [grunting] [farts] Huh? [laughs] Powerful weapon. OK. Yeah, you'll really blow the enemies away. Oh, yeah? Come here, you pile of mud. Whoa, you be a good pet, or I'll snap your horns off. I ain't afraid of you, you big wuss. [uplifting music] [laughs] Oh. [coughs] At least take me out for dinner before you try kissing me! Beautiful. What are they? Star flies, one of the few creatures that create life. Magnus, where are your comrades? Why do you fight alone? I-- General Jin, he saw how well I can fight, he saw my strength. So he sent me out on this mission. Time to wake up. You're no match for Kunlun. That can't be why he sent you. [laughs] Oh, I get it. He's a deserter. [sighs] Actually, I'm an orderly. I don't know how to fight. I wish I did. The fate of every Terracotta person is decided from the moment they're made. It's been like this for thousands of years. With one exception-- the year after the first tyrant attack, there was an intense battle. Our former general lost his life in battle. When the city gate was almost broken, a young soldier made a last ditch effort to turn the tides and save the whole city. That man was General Jin. [chanting] An orderly doesn't have to remain so forever. I want to be an elite. Like General Jin, I will change who I am. But everyone treats me like a joke. No one understands me. I get it. Grandpa always said, you can't choose the tools you're given, but you can choose how to build your life. So I do have a choice? You chase Kunlun because you want to be an elite. That's right. No matter what, I'll try my best. If you're serious, you must learn to fight. Come on. [gasps] Are you saying-- yes! You're going to teach me sword skills. Hah, teach that stone brain? Rocks can't learn. You're going to get it. [grunts] When we arrived, the bronze dragon was in ruin. My liege, this is all we got. [grunts] [screeching] Where is he? Kunlun must be close. Be careful, everyone. [gasps] The tyrants are attacking! Shorpa! [screeching] What is that? It's [inaudible]. Be quiet. He hunts by sound. I'm too handsome to die. Ahh! [pants] Watch out! [screams] It's Kunlun. Jade, this is not the time to chase after him. Let go. Run away! [grunting] [screaming] [groaning] [grunting] [gasping] Magnus! Catch it! [gasping] Run! [grunting] What are you up to, clay pot? Keep your dirty paws off of her. Magnus! [grunting] [laughs] Stupid worm, I bet you're afraid of me. I'm out of here. I can't hold on. You have to give me a hand. Aren't you a powerful weapon? Huh? Um, well-- OK, then. Here we go. [grunting] Huh? Huh? Uh, [laughs] There you go. How was that supposed to help me? Grab it! [grunting] Thanks. Uh, Jade. Pretty lady. Jade, are you all right? I-- a poison. Jade, stay with me. Take this. Hang in there. You're going to be fine. Jade, stay with me. We'll be out of here soon. It keeps going. There's no way out! Oh, man. What are we going to do? Magnus! Magnus! Look at the current. There must be an exit. We have to keep going downriver. Say what? You might be really skinny, Magnus, but you're made of stone. You won't make it. We're going to need a boat. That's a genius plan. I'll just ask the fish where to buy one. I'll bet there's great deals on boats this time of year. Magnus, there aren't any boats down there. [laughs] It's just like I said-- use your heart, and you can do anything. Catch! [groans] Pretty lady, I promise, you'll be OK. [gasps] Steer better, your buffoon! Hang on. The current's picking up. [gasping] Stop moving! It's not me! It's the boat! I'm too young to die, I'm too young to die! [dramatic music] Huh, Kunlun! Kunlun's down there. Ah! He must be lost too. [gasping] Tug down! [suspenseful music] [groaning] [chanting] [groans] Magnus, Magnus. Magnus, I-- [yawns] Jade, Jade! You're awake! What is this place? What happened? [pants] Did Kunlun just save us? That's Qin Yang. I think Kunlun saved us. Huh! Oh, yeah. You're back. [laughs] I'm fine. Don't worry. [grunts] Huh? Pretty lady! Pretty lady! Oh, thank goodness. Oh, you had me really worried. Did Magnus tell you how I carried you out of the cave all by myself? [laughs] Yeah, always the truth from you. Huh? Granny! [gasps] You saved my life. [laughs] You're sure pretty you're awake. You must be careful, child. There are many unruly men in Qin Yang City. Granny, don't say things like that. My, my, my. Your human skin is so much softer, but much more delicate. [laughs] Thank you for saving Jade. We'll be on our way now. Be careful with her, Magnus. I can't fix it. Hey don't throw it Shaman, may borrow these repair tools? Go ahead. Thank you, shaman. [sighs] What does she see in that mindless pile of clay? [sighs] It's such a shame. Back off, your mosquito! Dodo! You should be more careful. You're good at this. Stay still. Jade, why do you want to catch Kunlun so bad? I'm from Tong An. It's a Terracotta city far from here. I grew up with my grandfather. Jade, Jade, wait for me! And he told me that I was special, that I wasn't Terracotta. He helped me in my search for my real parents. We went far across the land. Our journey was tough, but we survived, yet never found anything. Still, grandpa didn't give up. One day, when we neared Qin Yang City-- no! Kunlun-- he killed grandpa. [sobs] I won't let him get away with it. Sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry. It's all right. [chatter] Move it, peasant. What's this thing? Garbage? What are you looking at? [crying] You hear the reports? Says there's a tyrant in Qin Yang. A tyrant inside the walls? That can't be true. No tyrant has past our gates. I doubt one came in. Speaking of tyrants, hey, boss, what do you think happened to that recruit Magnus? Dead, isn't he? Hah, I'll bet he's already dust. [crowd chatter] So many masks! Jade, check this out. Doesn't it look similar to the one you used to wear? [clears throat] You! You ruined my hunt! [laughter] It's pretty. Yeah. [uplifting music] [roaring] Huh? [gasping] [grunting] Jade! [grunting] [bells chiming] [screaming] [gasping] Magnus! Jade! Stay back. He saved our lives. Hand over the tyrant! [grunting] Stand aside, maggot. [grunting] I captured him. He was ours years ago in the mountains, if not for that stupid old man with a camel. We'll claim this capture! Jade. What old man? You-- Speak! Last-- last-- [grunting] Go! [grunting] You scum! It was you! Jade! All this time, it was you! [grunting] [gasping] Jade. [screaming] Please, let her go. It was a mistake. General, general! We managed to capture that tyrant, then they attacked us! They tried to free it! General, he's lying. They killed Jade's grandpa. That's why Jade fought them. And we caught the tyrant. General, that's garbage. No recruit could possibly catch that tyrant. I saw the skinny guy capture the tyrant. [grunts] [gasping] You're a bully. [blowing raspberry] General, these two stopped us from delivering your pills! Dismissed. Sir. Why did you let them go? They murdered my grandpa! It doesn't matter who you are. Death can't be cheated. Falling in battle was an honorable way for him to die. Where's my justice? You're protecting killers! You're no leader, you coward! General, Jade-- You bring such shame to your people! You don't deserve to be general! General Jin, please don't be mad at her. She lost her grandad and is overwhelmed by grief and anger. Please don't punish her. She helped me bring down Kunlun. Hmm. [grunting] Jade! An eye for an eye! [grunting] Jade! Jade. Get her. Move it. Don't. [grunts] I forgot, you're one of them. Clay soldiers don't have hearts. General. General, please, give her a chance. You fought well and with honor. So I will honor your grandfather's death and give you one last chance. And as for you, Magnus my boy, you are now an elite warrior. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Jade. Stay back! So you did it. You're elite. Jade, I-- [sighs] [sobs] Jade! It's weird. Normally, the scouts return home before dark. [yawns] I think they're taking their nap somewhere. [screaming] [gasps] The scout. [groaning] Formation! Get ready for battle. Send word to the others. Go! Yes, captain! For Qin Yang City! Ready yourselves! Captain. Captain. Captain. [groaning] Go! Giddy up. Huh? [gasps] [groans] [roaring] Quit struggling, you animal. You kill so many of us. I should turn your skin into a rug! [gasps] That's enough. Magnus. Sir. The general has ordered this tyrant be executed in public tomorrow. You don't need to punish it. What? Magnus sir, we just-- You're dismissed. We were assigned to this post. We can't just-- Get out! Yes, sir. General, I request a postponement of the beheading of the tyrant Kunlun. Our soldiers were killed by the keeper of the bronze dragon. Kunlun had nothing to do with it. Maybe we-- Enough! Tyrants are monstrous murdering beasts. They're all guilty. Tomorrow's execution will be a show of strength for all my warriors. Yes, I'll send men to the bronze dragon. And I give you the honor of being the executioner. General, I-- Hmm? Remember, you're one of us now. Huh. You're really not evil, are you? I've been such a fool. But now I see. NINE TAILS: Nothing is ever quite as it seems to be, my boy. Your eyes fail you. See with your heart. I should go before you make me regret this. Whoa, Kunlun! What are you-- whoa, let me go! [gasping] [faint voices in background] Kunlun, where are you going? [gasps] Out of the way! [gasping] What is this place? Mercury. Huh? This is-- The tyrants need this stone's power for their offspring. Its other powers still remain unknown. The-- the stone of creation. So you came to the city to recover your stone. This stone is the reason we're at war. Magnus. [gasps] You betrayed your comrades. General. Now what am I going to do with you? General, please let me explain. The tyrants only attacked our city to get this stone. Once we give it back to them, then Qin Yang City can finally be at peace. Give me the stone, Magnus. You know it's the right thing to do. Come on. What are you waiting for? You know it's the right choice. So why don't you just give me that stone right now? Come on, give it to me. Trust me. Wait. Why would the stone be here? That's not your concern. Give it to me. It was you. Hmm. Give it to me! [gasps] [grunting] Shorpa! How do you like them apples, huh? [grunting] Onward. Save yourselves! [grunting] Jade, you came back. I'm sorry-- There's no time for that. [grunting] General. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, wait for me! Woo! [groans] [screams] I've had enough. Soldiers of the elite, kill him. Jade, General Jin takes elixir pills. He must be part of the inn owner's shady scheme. Also, the tyrants only attack the city to take back their magic stone. It all makes sense. But now what? I'll return the stone to the tyrants. Isn't that treason? I'm doing this for Qin. Oh, yeah. Look out! [grunting] [suspenseful music] Are you all right? [horn blows] Magnus, what a pleasure is to see you again. Now hand over the stone, please. We've all fought as loyal soldiers of Qin, we've been engaged in this war with the tyrants for years now. But if any of you stop to think about why the tyrants invaded in the first place, it's because they want their stone of creation back. This stone belongs to them, their future depends on it. But someone stole it, and they brought it here to Qin Yang City. And the identity of that person is General Jin. But if we return it, then the war will come to an end. [chatter] Magnus is a traitor to us all! Get him! [gasping] Tyrants. Orders? Who here stands with me? Show him no mercy. Men, charge! General, we'll help with these traitors. We can't let him get the stone. [grunting] I've been waiting for this. Bring it on. [grunting] Take this! [grunting] [groaning] Ahh! [grunting] Huh? General! [grunting] Huh, what's happening? [grunts] [gasping] I can't move! [grunts] Yes! [grunting] Hey, is that the general? I don't know. Uh-oh. It's the stone. Huh? [grunts] [laughs] I like the way this feels! All these years, in order to possess power, you sowed the seeds of hate and started a war. So many people died and it was all because of you! [laughs] Look at me! I'm a god. Nothing can stop me. General, you're making a mistake. Stop this. So does anyone else have anything to say? Give me the stone! Magnus! [grunting] You're a dead man. [epic music] Jade! [grunting] [gasping] [grunting] [shouts] [groaning] [gasps] Jade! [gasping] Ha-ha. And you need to remember your place. I should have known you were worthless. You felt the power, didn't you? In the stone. Why do you even think you're here right now? I'm only here to take you down. It is power that decides fate, and I am the most powerful! The power is mine! Come on, get up. Weaker cockroaches to be squashed by those in power. You must have power, otherwise you're the cockroach. Die, cockroach! Ah! Ah. [laughs] Sure changed my faith. Its power radiates through me. I was changed from cockroach to god. Huh, tyrants? We're under attack! Quick! Close the gate! The power is mine, forever mine! [pants] [laughs] Magnus. Oh, come on, Magnus. You should want this. You started at the bottom just like me. And what difference does that make now? [grunts] Jade, no! Ah! [gasping] Jade, no. Jade, no! Jade! Ah! Jade! Ah! You're dead, you're a monster! Soldiers, charge him! Jade. Ja-- Ja-- Jade! Ma-- Magnus. [grunting] You treacherous weak-minded fools! Hah, you should worship me. [laughs] [gasping] This city has grown so weak. The time has come. I claim the underground as mine! [gasps] What's that? [gasping] [grunting] Jade! Magnus. Jade. [groaning] Magnus. Just hold on. Magnus, let me go. No, you promised. We'll visit Tong An City and find your family together. No, don't! Magnus, I'll always be here, here with you, in your heart. Goodbye. No. No! No. Jade! [sad music] [grunts] [gasps] Dodo! [grunting] [laughs] Magnus, you're just an orderly. You're not allowed to have a sword. Hah, you're going to regret what you did. What do you hope Yesterday's moon light tomorrow's path. A step without heart, a step in the dark. Magnus, did you find your way? Did your feet take you where you wanted to go? You can't be elite. They're made that way. This guy. Think you're a soldier, maggot? And as for you, Magnus my boy, you are now an elite warrior. Remember, you're one of us now. You can't choose the tools you're given, but you can choose how to build your life. Orderly, elite warrior-- these titles don't matter. The ones who you love matter. They are what give life its meaning. And for them, I'd give it all up. Magnus, I think you finally see. [vocalizing] [grunts] Huh? [epic music] [grunts] Magnus! The stone's power cannot be matched. Prepare to die! Hiyah! You will pay for everything you've done. This is for Jade! [grunting] It's over, Magnus! [grunting] [explosion] [gasping] [groans] [grunts] [pants] [dramatic music] (SINGING) Your eyes shine bright in the darkest night. Your smile, it shows me where to go. Two worlds then collide, we stand here side by side. This is where we belong. [cheering] Bring your home in my heart. I'm safe here with you I love you. Please stay. Oh, it's me and you. Us against it all. You bring your home in my heart. I'm safe here with you. It's me and you. Look inside your heart. [cheerful music] (SINGING) Let the moon light and the starlight guide our hearts on their way home. Night and day will change as we go. We'll walk bravely down these winding roads in search of our desires. Every step bringing us together. Over mountain and rivers we'll explore the land. Don't fear, this path will lead to our dreams. If we lose our way and the sun set, don't forget, we have each other. Side by side, we will face the darkest nights. If you're lost, come find me and you'll see the light. You and I, we will fly above the sky. I know you will always be there for me. You complete me.
