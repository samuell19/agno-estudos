1977, TADA 1977, TADA DEPARTMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGY Hello, who is speaking? -Is your dad at home, Dear? -Wait, I'll call him. Daddy, phone for you. Hello, Inspector Ranjan here. Sir, someone has been murdered in the archaeological department. The treasure found at Tada site is missing, sir. What happened over there? I have informed Ranjan sir. Please come here at once, sir. KABADADAARI A MAN IN DISGUISE What are your daily activities? A policeman's life is like the old Government of India's Doordarshan TV channel. No changes whatsoever. I will wake up at 6 o'clock sharp. After doing some push-ups and pull-ups, without fail I'll be at the police station by 8:30. Is the sub inspector of police given a gun? Traffic police doesn't get any weapon let alone a gun. Gun? What for, sir? To shoot the ones without license? -No. -Then for what, sir? You know, these boys under the guise of riding a bike, do eve-teasing and create public nuisance. I need a gun to shoot such riff-raffs. And for how long you have been a traffic sub-inspector? Two years. -So? -Sir. I've filed more cases than anyone in the last two years. I joined the police force to work in the crime department. Sir, give me just one chance. If you set your heart, it can be done. What's wrong with you? You scored badly in the written test. How can you expect to work in crime? I was suffering from typhoid on that day. Stop spinning yarns like a school-boy. Will you accept bribes? -No. -Hey! If God gives you lemons, you should learn to make lemonade! -Sir? -Otherwise, you'll lose even your traffic post. This place is like a temple donation box. Why are you turning your back to the Goddess of Wealth? Go, attend to your work. -Go, I say! -Sir! Your hobbies? Hobbies... Playing chess and watching crime series. An ordinary soldier killed the king. Yay! Super! Don't feel bad. You played very well, okay? -I hope the children didn't trouble you. -Not at all. Come on, catch me. Please take this for this month's expenses. -I don't need it, sir. -Accept it, please. -Thanks a ton, sir. -Thank you. Sex? You know that I'm male, don't you? I wasn't talking about your gender. I asked if you have prior experience in sex or not? Oh! You want to know that. No. Not even once? Okay, bye. Time just flew talking to you. -Okay, thank you. Bye. -All the best. [sighs] [mobile ringing] -Hello, Mom. -Do you like the girl? I like all the girls. And they like me too. I thought I could marry -one girl from each area. -Hey! Then what, Mom? They talk from web series to cricket and then they shake hands saying they don't want a cop for a husband. Forget all that and listen to me. Visit Lord Perumal temple every Saturday and pray. You'll witness the miracle. Mom, I agreed to meet them for your sake. Velu, there's a deep pit on that side. Play over here. [loud horrified scream] Earlier there was a big lake next to this area. These could be corpses swept from there. I can't share any information until we complete our investigation. You can leave now. -Sir. Sir, one minute. -What is it? This skull was found in the area where I work. So? Can I also join in this investigation, sir? Then shall I go home and watch the cricket match? -Sir... -Focus only on your work. Stick to clearing the traffic on the road and getting your palms greased. This is our job. These skulls look like they are from the same family. -That's why. -Did the skulls talk to you or what? Did they introduce themselves as mother, father, and daughter to you? Mr. Shakthi, there are so many out there in the city riding without a helmet. Go save their skulls first. Nosey parker! Earlier there was a big lake next to this area. These could be corpses swept from there. I can't share any information until we complete our investigation. You can leave now. [mobile ringing] Hello. I am in the middle of work. I'll be back soon. Hey! Who is that? Hello, mister! Who are you? Who are you, man? How dare you ask me that! If I break your limbs in the station, you will know who I am! Department, huh? Press. Press reporter. Hey! First come up. Give me a hand, brother. Ouch! Hey! Don't you have the basic sense not to trespass into a crime scene? Which press do you belong to? Show me your ID card. Lockup News. Show me a proper ID card, or else you in lock-up will be the news headlines. Take it out. Lockup News editor Kum... What are you doing here? I was told skulls were found when this place was dug up. I came to see if I can get a cover story for my paper. At this time of night? Crime reporter has no fixed working hours, sir. Twenty-four hours on duty. Most impressive! You're taking a dig at me! Give my ID card, sir. I'll leave. Come to the station tomorrow and collect it. Sir, stop playing games with me. Why should I come? -Return my card... -Told you to come to the station. -Got it? -Sir... Sir! Attitude with which you spoke last night, I thought you must be the new inspector in Crime branch. -Now I am wiser... -Morning, sir. ...you are a traffic policeman. So we aren't considered part of the police department? You could say so. Like the difference between an iPhone and Korean phone, that's all. Return my ID Card and I'll go my way. I won't. What will you do? Showing off your power, huh? What else will a reporter do? Buy a paper and read it tomorrow, sir. Praise be to Lord Ganesha. -Sir! -Come. God, please grant good sense to everyone. Sit. I said sit down! Read the newspaper on the table. LOCKUP IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF MANPOWER IN TAMIL NADU POLICE DEPARTMENT TRAFFIC POLICE IN CRIME INVESTIGATION You escaped because it is election time. And people don't use this paper even to parcel food! If this was the headlines of any other paper, department would have buried us alive by now. Sir, he has done this deliberately. Why did you go there? Sorry, sir. I think it's a murder. That's why I tried to investigate it. Look, that's a closed case. I've already enquired thoroughly with Inspector Dayalan. Those skeletons were buried under the ground decades ago. We have 1000s of problems in the city. It's election time. Just do your work, okay? Sir, give me just one chance, please. No way. This is the last warning. If you cross the like again... Sorry, sir. Out! Sir, don't lay a hand on me! Sir, don't hit me! Very wrong on your part. Sir, tell him not to hit me. You're cooking it up, aren't you? Do you think we are imbeciles? Give me one week's time, sir, I'll return it for sure. Sir, I'll definitely repay. Ask him not to hit me. You said the exact same thing last month too. Sir... No, sir... I'll repay in a week. I swear on God, sir! Sir... Please, sir! Sir, don't! [loud scream] This time, I'm letting you off with a broken finger. You've got one week. Hey! Let's go. [groaning] Oh! Who are they, sir? Riff-raffs from our area, sir. I borrowed some money from them. They broke my finger for not repaying in time. Open this for me, sir. -Let me do it, sir. -It's okay, sir. More than reporters who stick to the truth, one who likes to be a lackey in a political party or a boot-licker to movie celebrities is more in demand nowadays. The richer you are in this world, your word is the law! Money talks! I should be in the top rung for all the cover stories I wrote. I'm ill-fated! I was a partner with a conniving cheat. I trusted him with my life, but he betrayed me. I lost all that I earned and saved. If I think about my life, I feel like dying in that metro construction pit. This is a disgusting profession, sir. By the way, I heard they buried this case along with the decomposed bones. How do you know this? I am in the media, sir. I know what's happening behind closed walls in your department from A to Z. How many years of drowning in this mire! Sir, can we order one quarter? Hmm, go ahead. -Hey! -Hey. Sir! Sir! -Stop the bike. -Wait. I will. I will. [groans softly] One minute, sir. I'll be back. Hey! You think you are so great and you're glaring at me, huh? Son of a gun! Just because you've made it big in life, you think you are the cat's whiskers! Do you intend cleaning the city? Fraud! Even if you clean up a mongrel and raise it as a pet, that street dog will always be a mongrel! Hey! Only I know your true colors! Even if you forget it, I won't! He doesn't deserve a banner! -I should stone him! -Sir! It's public nuisance and police will be notified. -Shouldn't let him go scot-free. -Listen to me, sir. -Get a gun, sir. -Careful. -Let's shoot him. -We'll do so in the morning. Sir! Sir... No matter how far up you are, I won't spare you. I won't spare you wherever you go. Dad! What happened? He's drunk. You are... I didn't drink. -I asked your name. -I am Shakthi. Come in, Dad. Watch your step. Right, sir. -I can walk by myself. -Thank you. -You go home safe, sir. -Okay. Goodnight. Greetings, sir. Sir, I've brought the case file and forensic report you asked Mani. Take it, sir. -Keep it confidential, sir. -Thank you. Come up. I'm coming. Sir, the files you asked for. -All papers intact? -Yes, sir. Our finding based on the carbon dating report, these bones belong to a 30 to 32-year-old male. This is a 28 to 30-year-old female. This is an eight to ten-year-old child. The child's bones have disintegrated because of the tender age. Initially, I couldn't figure out if it was death from natural causes or murder. But noticing the way these bones have been broken, it seemed a bit unusual. At the same time, it can happen after the burial due to the pressure of the mud. But the toy car found along with the bones and other items makes me suspect this may be a murder. Sir? These are the items I mentioned. How long ago were they buried? Going by the tests we conducted, must be approximately 40 years. What will they do to these bones? Government will arrange for a proper burial. You've buried all the bones in one pit? Government has sanctioned money for only one pit, sir. I've finished, sir. Must inscribe the names of the deceased in the tomb. Do you know their names? Not yet. -I'll let you know soon. -Okay. I'll take your leave, sir. Got all the papers? -Sir... -Hey! Check him. Documents are at home, sir. Sir, are you still obsessing about those skulls? I'm unable to wipe that case off my mind. What are you saying, sir? -Hey! Go, go. -Some years ago there was a lake nearby, so many corpses were found on the banks of the lake, sir. Do you know which year? Sir, this is buying trouble. We should not interfere in Crime department matters, sir. Listen, Constable. Police department does not differentiate traffic or crime. If we witness a crime right in front of us, we should question it which department is not important. Just tell me which year. Between 1975 to 1980, sir. That's when high-raise buildings were constructed. You know where the case files regarding that are stored? Yes, sir. Take your time and look through these files, sir. -Sir, the files you asked for are all here.-A strange path unknown unfolds before me The journey stretches ahead endlessly A secret hunt continues in a flurry Here and now, pit your wits, hurry He will be a carbon copy of you He will follow you like a shadow He will smile at you like a friend duly Day in and day out, daily He will lay a booby trap behind you He will split your skull into two Man with a mask who can deceive you Master of disguise A false face personifies To track and trail an unknown identity Heart stumbles in waves of uncertainty Like a wolf lurking In sheep's clothing Deceit will play even within you irking In a world full of lies unleashed Law and justice on the roads trashed Truth like a pair of dice poised Will swirl and twirl daily unvoiced Eyes will be blinded by conspiracy Selfishness will gain supremacy Like Buddha, calm on the exterior He is Hyde hidden in the interior Man of disguise Sir. -Master of deceit and duplicity... -Sir. Sir! Tea, sir. Perceptive and hawk-eyed He will casually go past this side Concentration will go Out of the window He is one who buries underground Strategies never to be found Masquerader with a pen name Charade is the name of his game Smoke-screen veil to fame -Will Kumar be late? -He should be home anytime now. If my dad has borrowed any money from you, I will repay you. No. Nothing of that sort. I have some work with him. You relax. As if his turnover is five billion! What arrogance! Don't buy anything from this fraud Raja's shop. He says he will deliver the items only if I pay! Of course, he will ask. Who will give freebies? What did you do with the money I gave you, Dad? They went on foot as pilgrimage to Tirupati, I gave it as my offering in the temple donation box. -You'll never reform! -Sir, huh? -When did you come? -Just now. Make a cup of coffee for me too, dear. -Tell me, sir. -In the year 1977, a police inspector by name Ranjan was assigned in M5 police station in Ennore. -Have you heard of him? -Ranjan... Not that I remember. Shall I ask around in the department? It's okay, I'll find out. That Ranjan seems a mystery cop. But if I can get my hands on his investigation report, I can find out for sure the motive behind the three murders. February 25th, 1977, that morning a complaint was filed about a murder and theft in the archaeological department. Murdered victim was Sampath. Age 32. First step in our investigation -was the items stolen from the locker. -Hello. Yes. This is Ganapathy speaking. Tada Division head, Chittoor head office, the boss of Suresh who went missing. During the Tada site excavation, many treasures were found dating back to the Vijayanagara dynasty. Jewelry worth almost eight to nine million requesting a transfer of the treasures to Madras head office I passed an order. Suresh said the situation is not conducive here so he wanted two days' time. [Ranjan] What was so wrong with the situation? Some political agitation is rampant, there are riots all over the place so he said he would send it two days later. Now what's weird is, he himself is missing. [Ranjan] Sampath's body was first found by office peon Sebastian. I have been working with Sampath sir for ten years. I reach our office daily by 8:00 a.m., sir. On that day too I came at 8:00 sharp. Ah! Oh God! Murder... Murder! My stomach somersaulted, sir. If I think of that pool of blood, I can't sleep even now, sir. [Ranjan] Sampath was killed with a sharp weapon. At the same time, a knife usually fixed on the office wall was missing. My name is Surendhar, sir. I am working for the past 15 years in the Department of Archaeology, sir. Only Sampath sir has the key to our department's locker. No one else can lay hands on it. Whatever treasures we find will be under his safe custody after testing. [Ranjan] At a distance of 30 km from Madras, near Ennore, a car was burnt down and abandoned. We later found it belonged to Suresh working in the same department. But there was no information about Suresh. As far as this case was concerned, that car was an important evidence. Because the missing knife was also found in that burnt car belonging to Suresh. Since Suresh was not around for the enquiry, we interrogated his servants. Shanthi, a cook in Suresh's house. I have been cooking for sir for the past five years. I served him coffee at 6:00 a.m. sharp. Sir. Sir. I came an hour later, the coffee was untouched. The door was locked too. Thinking that sir must have gone out before daybreak somewhere, I went to ask Rayadu the servant. I am Rayadu, sir. Shanthi ma'am referred me to this place. [mobile ringing] -Hello? -Sir, Kumar speaking. What is the matter? Nothing, sir. When I saw how interested you are in this case, I have decided to help you. Whatever information I get, I will pass on to you. It is up to you to give me the cover story or not. Forget that. I'll help you to trace that inspector. Thanks. We went into his room, his wardrobe was open and empty without any sign of his clothes. Thinking that he must have gone on some assignment, we got back to work. Yes, sir. I remembered, madam asked me to keep her suitcase in the room the previous day. -Rayadu. -Coming, madam. Sir will come home late, you go and sleep. Okay, madam. Keep my suitcase in my room. -I have to pack... -[Ranjan] Previous day, Suresh's wife had said she was going out of town the next day. Mysteriously, that night the whole family went missing. Something fishy. They have planned a trip out of town after a murder Is this mere coincidence or well-planned act? I continued my interrogation as to why Suresh's family left town. I started enquiring people in his inner circle. My name is Mahadevan. Suresh is my neighbor. He held an account in the same bank I was working. Suddenly, 2-3 days earlier, he closed his account and withdrew the entire amount. [Ranjan] Kasi. Suresh's gardener. What were you doing the previous night when your boss went missing? Sebastian visited us that night, sir. But I left for home at 9 o'clock that night, sir. What he said was true, sir. After he left I got drunk too, sir. Sir, I forgot to tell you something. Suresh sir had asked me to come to his chamber, sir. -Sebastian. -Sir? -Some political agitation it seems. -Okay, sir. -Lock down has been enforced. -Okay, sir. -Sampath will be with me. -Okay, sir. -All of you go home soon. -Okay, sir. -I'll go with Sampath after we finish work -Okay, sir. There was a huge agitation outside, sir. That's why I thought may maybeSuresh sir sent us earlier than usual. Sir, my name is Fernandez. I've been his driver for the past 5-6 years. But that night I wasn't on duty. No one was in the office other than Suresh sir and Sampath sir. -Fernandez! -Sir? I will be a little late, you can go home. It's okay, sir. I will wait. It's alright. You go home. Okay, sir. I went home straight because of the riot outside. [Ranjan] Suresh's security guard Mohan. That night as usual, sir came home in his car. But what was unusual instead of Fernandez, my boss was driving the car himself. Even in that split second, I noticed the blood stains on his shirt. Before I could ask him what happened, he went in and shut the door. I went back to my post thinking it is none of my business. The night was still and silent. Suddenly in an hour, the lights flickered. Then there was a total power outage. Sir? Sir? [groaning in pain] I don't know who hit me, sir. That's all I know, sir. But I think maybe Suresh sir had a partner. That man, Suresh sir and his wife must have joined hands to commit this crime. Witness accounts, especially oral statement by the security guard, taking all these into account, husband and wife must have been the murderers for sure. Don't know if it was their greed, or someone else's conspiracy. But the sacrificial lamb was the innocent child. May 27th, 1985. Due to the finding of an important evidence I request you to reopen this case. From, Ranjan Investigating officer. Suresh and his wife Viji's greed or another man's scheming must have been the reason for Sampath's murder, and the death of Suresh's daughter Vaidehi. Definitely an associate of Suresh must have been the murderer. One of those interrogated has lied in the oral statements. Who is more avaricious than Suresh? -Hello, Shiva.-Yes, Shakthi. In 1977, in M5 police station, there was an Inspector by name Ranjan. I need details about him. -Okay. -Thanks. Don't stop. Keep going. -Hey! Stop, stop. -Show me your license. Riding a bike without a helmet. Go and meet sir. -Stop! -Please, sir. Thank you, sir. -Hello? -Shakthi. -You asked for Ranjan's details, right? -Yes. It has been 35 years since he retired from service. His name isn't mentioned even in the pension list. I have texted via WhatsApp his old department ID card. Okay, thank you. Are you deaf or what? Just send him. Don't make a fuss. Hey! Stop. I said stop. Go, show him your papers. What, sir? Watching a film in Tamil Rockers, huh? Have you seen him anywhere? This man? He is that drunken monk, sir. What are you blabbering? He was the one who blabbered, sir, not me. We caught him in Guindy. Totally tanked. He asked 40 times, "Do you know who I am?" -That old Fiat car. -Exactly, sir. His address must be on the charge sheet? -Yes, sir. -First find that. Sir. Is anyone home? Hello, sir? Sir, anyone in there? Who the hell are you, man? Is this your first robbery? Are you mad or what? I would have been dead if you hadn't missed. You think now I can't close your chapter, huh? What the hell were you doing in my garden? Sir, my name is Shakthi. You can be Shakthi or Shiva for all I care. Reply only to the questions I ask you. Sir, in 1977, a man called Suresh stole from the archaeological department, murdered his colleague Sampath. And went into hiding with his family I read the report filed by you. I read the case file and found out you investigated this case. Sir, the family that went missing has been found, sir. While digging for Metro work some bones were unearthed. I have a strong suspicion it may be Suresh and his family, sir. Sir, after you closed that case nearly eight years later that is May 27th, 1985 you found some new evidence, sir. It was only after that you wanted the case reopened. What was so important an evidence you found on that date, sir? I couldn't find anything in the case file either. And because we don't have any DNA samples from that family we couldn't match and confirm it positively. To confirm if the bones unearthed are in fact those family members, if we get any lead from you, it will be of great help. So, please, sir. I'm not obligated to tell you anything. -Out! -Please, sir. Don't refuse, sir. Kindly help me in this case. Please, sir. Sir, one minute. Listen to me, please, sir. Sir, I think one more person may be involved in this case besides Suresh. Give me just one hint who that can be, sir. Sir, no one is bothered about this case. I am an ordinary Traffic police. I work during the day and I investigate this case at night. You have investigated this case. That's why I'm asking you for help, sir. Details of the bones we got now, forensic report, everything is in this file. I'll be grateful if you can see it when you are sober. Okay, sir. Okay. My sore eyes bloom In my dream to blossom My dreams crawl in delight Child-like in your lap at night A new journey unfolds ahead of me Petals of my life every day wither sadly Every night I lie on our sheet, dear With fond memories of you right here O' girl, I wane in every sense Because of your absence In my doorway unmistaken I inhale your scent often In my breath I always see Your face greeting me happily My tired eyes bloom In my dream to blossom My dreams crawl in delight Child-like in your lap at night A new journey unfolds ahead of me Petals of my life every day wither sadly Every night I lie on our sheet, dear With fond memories of you right here O' girl, I wane in every sense Because of your absence In my doorway unmistaken I inhale your scent often In my breath I always see Your face smiling at me [whistling] As dawn slips to dusk clock ticks as well Night slithers into its deepest shell Where do I fit into this hell? Seconds as hands of thorn now Prick my soul's innermost alcove Is pain a pleasure somehow? I realized it is a battlefield But I forgot to fight or wield a shield Don't try to bloom with your scented sari In my desert-heart that beats an elegy Because of you, my dream-- What kind of life am I leading, O' God! Stop right there. If you set foot in this direction once more, then there won't be any difference between the skulls you found and you! Shoot. Pull the trigger. You are spoken very highly of in our department. But now it is evident there's no chance it is you! To lead a life like this today you should be ashamed, sir. Being addicted to alcohol, you are leading a coward's life. Leaving the case you took up unfinished, just because your family died being the only reason, how is it fair on your part to leave it halfway, sir? Who will ensure justice to an anonymous family, sir? Poor child! They didn't even spare that young girl. My anger erupted only because of that, sir. I took up this case. But you are least bothered, right? Go and get sloshed somewhere and sprawl down senseless. I won't set foot anywhere near you. To think I jumped over this wall respecting this man. I need to slipper my brains! Eyes of the wind wept grief-stricken Looking for wings to sweep unbidden Was that rain in depression? Police officers like you have no retirement. I have lost everything I had. I don't know why I'm alive. Maybe you are here to wind up this case for all you know. By investigating a case where a man died 40 years ago... ...what will I achieve now? We died 30 years ago. Have you stopped thinking about us? Some random youngster has taken up this case and is struggling with it. This is your case. Only to finish what you start is my Ranjan's style. Sir, look who has come. Sir? Oh! A sincere police officer can sleep fitfully only if he solves his half-finished case. But all the cases can't be closed so easily. Some cases possess us like spirits and give us grief. Like this one. It was Emergency period then. The nation was engulfed in darkness. Like this Covid-19 now. You are so experienced, sir. On that day too, I stood in this same spot. This case had got hold of me like a monitor lizard. I had left no stone unturned in looking for Suresh. Why did you think of reopening this case, sir? You know very well. When we are investigating a case, and if we suspect someone, whatever they do will seem wrong. I did the same mistake. I shouldn't have. What are you saying? Then Suresh isn't the culprit? According to my analysis, Suresh is innocent. With the situation then and the leads and evidences we got, we were forced to believe he was the culprit. But the truth maybe, whoever killed Sampath must have killed Suresh too. Poor man! Suresh wasn't escaping. They have buried his family and him along with the truth down here. With the evidences I got then, this was all I could decipher. So you also think someone else stole all the treasures? Yes. What was the new evidence you got, sir? Where are those case files? It isn't a new evidence. When we investigate a case, our eyes should become blind to the lies surrounding us. Our hawk-eyes should focus only on the truth, not lies that seem to resemble the truth. When I was inspecting Suresh's house on that day, I found a prescription that was slightly blood stained. But details about the doctor was completely missing. So we couldn't reach him. Then how did you find out with the handwriting on a prescription? Eight years after Suresh went missing, while I was investigating some other case, I saw another medical prescription in that same handwriting. That's how I found the doctor's address. Our assumption was wrong. Suresh did not kill Sampath. He has saved someone's life! Sir! Doctor? Get these medicines immediately. Good girl! [spluttering] Vaidehi. Vaidehi. Vaidehi. Sir, who do you think is behind all this? This happened 40 years ago. I wonder if the thief bought an island, became a politician or an underground don. I don't even know if he is alive today. If you can advise me on how to go about this case, it will be use-- Shakthi. I don't want to be a policeman anymore. You are the one who wants to shift from Traffic to Crime. Take this as an opportunity and solve this case. The way he found that treasure, you will find him. All the best. [mobile ringing] -Hello.-Sir, it's me. I got an important lead regarding our case. -Can we meet, sir? -Super! I am going to Minjur to provide security. I'll meet you tomorrow evening. -Okay, sir. -Thank you. Swathi, do you know where your dad is? I've been trying to reach him for a long time. -His phone is switched off. -He isn't at home. He went to his office yesterday. He hasn't come back as yet. Why? Is there any problem? No, nothing of that sort. But why has he switched off his phone? Unable to face his creditors sometimes he switches it off. Did you find any change in him recently? Specific change means... After you met him, he has got a cover story through you it seems. He said it will change our life completely. Not only that, he has got a lead about actress Ramya. He said he intends interviewing her. After a long time, I saw in my dad, that old excitement and rush of adrenalin. Okay. Thanks. If he calls you, ask him to call me at once. -Sorry for disturbing you so late. -It's okay. -See you. -Bye.

Hello, ma'am. Who are you? Please wait outside. Shekar-- Actually I'm not-- Excuse me. Get out! Hello, hello. Excuse me. I'm not a junior artiste. This isn't a rented costume either. I'm sub inspector Shakthi. I am here to enquire regarding a case. I'll wait outside. -Junior artistes, go there. -Over there, sir? Field clear. -Sir? -Move to the side. Madam wants to meet you. In our cinema world, everything is only make-believe. We show things that don't exist and make people believe. But in your profession, you don't trust even the truth and suspect everyone. That's why I was rude to you not realizing you're a real policeman. Go ahead. Ma'am, Lockup News is a-- [knock on door] -Come in. -Madam, shot ready. I'll act that scene and tell you without putting on an act. Madam will be delayed it seems. Save your contact number in this mobile. She will call you. Take it, sir. Hey, Bomma. Come, come. No one knows when he will come and when he will vanish. What is that heroine's name? Ramya, sir. Ramya? I don't rem-- I didn't come across such a name in my investigations. How do you say there's a link between Ramya and this case? Sir, that Editor Kumar had collected some details about this case. Based on that lead, sir. If there are any personal files related this case, can I take a look? Thank you, sir. [doorbell] 8 o'clock. So punctual. Are you always on time? Or was it a desire to meet this Ramya? You can take it any which way. As long as I get what I want. All your problems will be resolved. Come in. I expected you to be in your uniform. Do you know anyone by the name Suresh? Shakthi, the night is still young. Don't rush it. Let me get you a drink. Don't stare at the photos too much. Why don't you look at me? Mrs. Shakthi. Does she exist? No. -Girlfriend? -No. Actually, I don't care. Cheers! Do you know Suresh? Many years ago, he was working in the archaeological department. In 1977... Sexy color, no? His family was murdered-- You were saying something, right? It's very hot. Do you want some ice? I can get you some ice. Just wait. Questions to be asked will be tough. But don't stop, okay? Sure, sir. -Sir is asking you to talk like him-- -One second. Okay, fine. Sir. I called you so many times, but you didn't pick my calls, sir. Yes! Why do you keep trying if I don't pick your call? Aren't you ashamed? Hang up now. Sir, sir. Don't hang up, sir. I have Breaking News that can change the Election results to be announced, sir. Please meet me at Inox basement, sir. Find some gullible idiot and tell him. I was forced to sit at home for two years thanks to the wrong news you gave me. I don't want anything to do with you. Sir, you are right to feel that way. I blundered last time. Just meet me once, sir. I'll tell you the whole story. Day and night without even going home I have found this, sir. You can decide if you will use this or not after you hear me out, sir. Please, sir. Okay, this is the last time. I'll see you there. Okay, thanks, sir. Hey! Stop, stop. Are you trying to cheat me out of the money you owe me? -Today you're dead, man. -Sir, two days-- Give me two days, sir. I'll pay you, sir The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off. Sorry, I disturbed you. The doctor has said he should be under observation for 24 hours. Only after getting the scan reports, we will know if he'll make it or not. -Don't worry. -Excuse me. He never listens to me. I tell him we can lead a good life with what we have, but does he listen? He didn't let me accept an offer I got from a renowned News channel. How long can I be right next to him? He is obsessed with his damn press! I'm so mad I feel like burning down that damn Press office. Hey! Don't say that. You were the inspiration for him to start that press. Don't harbor these thoughts and get upset unnecessarily. Be brave. Do you suspect anyone? He has borrowed money left, right and center. On top of it, he never told me about that mysterious cover story. Sorry for wasting your time. No, no! Not at all. Update me immediately as soon as you hear from the doctor, okay? -Take care. -Okay. Ajay, announce this 'Breaking News'. Sandy, come here. You hold this. Get 30 seconds clippings and photos of popular actress Ramya immediately. Okay, sir. Abhi, change Election News to scrolling immediately. Type what I tell you. Most sought after actress Ramya known for her tri-lingual films was shot dead early this morning by a mysterious killer. With her proficient acting skill and charismatic looks she had a fan following equal to heroes for more than 20 years. Photos of Ramya are rampant online now. Police are on a witch hunt to find the killer. Our interview with the Police commissioner. We have just started the investigation. CCTV isn't working. So we have no clue about the killer This is all I can impart now. Continue watching our News for updates by the minute. What were you doing in Ramya's house at that time? I'm asking you, tell me. Then, Inspector. What else? Don't try baiting me. This is a murder investigation. Not your film shoot. Ten-year-old girl has been murdered too. Help me if you can. Otherwise, no problem. Goodnight. Sir, I came and told you everything without hiding anything from you. If you are still suspicious of my actions, you can call me anytime for an inquiry. I'm also from the department, sir. I won't run away anywhere. Okay, you can go. I'll call you. If you get involved in this case again, I'll be forced to take action against you. Sorry, sir. Sir? -Ranjan sir. -Who is it? Sir, it's me, Shakthi. What do you want this time of the night? There's a strong connection between Suresh's case and actress Ramya, sir. -What makes you say that? -Sir. When I went to Ramya's house I saw a photo of Ramya wearing this same necklace. Superb. -I'll get ready and come. -Okay, sir. Careful, sir. Sir, come. Sir, this is the photo I told you about. Look at her necklace. Perfect match! Sir, let me see if I can find some other clue. Sir, tread softly. -Any clues, Shakthi? -Sir! Someone else is in here. Hey! Stop, I say. Sir, get in fast. Sir, police. Shakthi. Don't think this is an old car. Press the accelerator. By the time we stop and explain to our men, he may escape. What do we do, sir? Divert. Control room, suspicious sandal Fiat Number plate not clear. Report as soon as you spot it, over. Hello, Control room Sandal color Fiat -heading towards Anna Nagar round-turn. -Turn right. Hello, Control room TSI Shakthi here. Suspicious black Honda Civic is heading towards Egmore. Report the moment you spot it, over. Sir, the black Honda Civic you mentioned is heading towards Egmore Child Hospital, over. Smart, Shakthi. Sir, let's go and nab him. No, no, no. Are you mad? He's a criminal. See, he's just a Sim card. If you nab him now, it will be tough to find out the tower that's operating him. Let's wait till that Sim card gets a call. Sir, sir. I think he must be a mechanic, sir. -Hey! Get me spanner 10-11. -Yes, sir. Okay, you take some rest. -I'll take over now. -Okay, sir. Sir, he's leaving. -Shakthi. -Sir? This place somehow seems familiar to me. So many buildings have come up now. How many years do you think since these were built? This area was developed about 15 years ago. Oh! He doesn't look like an ordinary car mechanic. Yeah. COROMANDEL RESORT Sir, sir, don't go that... What are you doing here? We may lose him, come soon. -Shakthi. -Sir? I have been here before. Didn't I report I found a knife in Suresh's car that was burnt? This is that place. Behind that tree. What are you saying, sir? I am damn sure. Sir, your campaign funding was through black money from many corporate firms. That's the strong rumor. What is your comment? Whoever is finding fault with me today, should remember that people haven't forgotten the corruption during their rule. Sir, our channel has telecast a program about the biggest scam by your Party. Your comment on it? People have given you the answer. In a few hours counting will be done. The result will be in our favor for sure. What other answer are you expecting? Sir, Ramya's murder, Suresh case, I think it's all interlinked. None of these can be passed off as mere coincidence. I somehow feel the murderer we are after is here somewhere. [mobile ringing] Hello, tell me, Swathi. -Dad wants to tell you something. -Okay. Dad. -Sir.-Yes, Kumar. I have to talk to you about this case. Can you come over immediately? I'll come right now. Editor Kumar wants to discuss something with me regarding this case. Shall I go meet him now? -Find out and call me. -Okay. I'll take care at this end. -Follow that reaction. -Hello, is that so? Okay. Okay. Sir, news confirmed from three different sources. Don't be in a hurry, I'm waiting for a very important source. Okay, sir. Results of all constituencies have been announced. We will know very soon the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Wide. MMTK LEADING VOLUNTEERS CELEBRATE Sir, the ballot counting today has created a stir all over Tamil Nadu. Rumor is your Party is involved in the maximum number of scams. What is your opinion? What do you think is the reason for your victory in this election? You sound like a broken record, madam. If our Party was involved in scams, could we have won in so many places? -One minute. -Tell me, sir. Who owns this resort? I don't know, sir. Rascal! Sir, why did you hit me now? Why are you working here without knowing who your boss is? You belong to a generation which disrespects elders. Sir, why are you talking in such a disjointed way? Hey! Go and call your owner now. -Go. -Okay, sir. Tell him I am from Lockup News. I swear our Party isn't involved in any scam! In Suresh's case, how did you find out Ramya's connection? With the jewelry of course. You don't know that Ramya's initial years as an actress, right? When she entered the cinema industry in 1999 all the big shots and celebrities in the city went behind her absolutely besotted by her. I had a friend by the name Gopal. In that-- He was a reporter in EETTI. Poor chap! He's dead now. He had all the underworld contacts you can ever imagine. One of those dons he knew and our dear heroine. He said they had deep contact. Camera two. I'll shut down the entire resort in just one write-up. He hit me while I was talking. -Let me ask, wait. -Hey. Not just you. If my questions don't get answered, -I'll slap all of you. -Sir. What do you want to know? Resort owner's name, that's all? Hey! All I asked was the name of your boss. Did I ask for the resort? Blurt it out for God's sake. That don fell flat for her, head over heels. He has even gifted her expensive jewelry. Rumor is that necklace... From the Vijayanagar dynasty was gifted to her. Not just precious jewelry, many of the films this female acted in Don was the financier. No one is aware of all this. Once when Gopal was totally tanked, he blabbered everything. You will be shell shocked if I tell you the don's name. -Shall I tell you? -Who, sir? Take a wild guess! -Live.-Breaking News. Minjur Ranganathan has been elected the new chief minister of Tamil Nadu, on behalf of MMTK party. MR. MINJUR RANGANATHAN ELECTED AS CHIEF MINISTER OF TAMIL NADU MMTK HAS CREATED HISTORY WITH 85% VOTES IN THEIR FAVOR MR. RANGANATHAN SECURED 90% VOTES IN HIS CONSTITUENCY AND WINS HANDS DOWN Sir, even if we enquire this case from various angles, it all comes back to -Minjur Ranganathan.-Yes. Between Suresh's case and Ramya's murder now there is a definite link with Minjur Ranganathan. But we don't know how or why. First of all, we should find out who is Minjur Ranganathan and what's his background -to decode this link. -Okay, sir. I'll go to Minjur now and try to find out. You should not arouse anyone's suspicion about your enquiry over there. If we have decided to enter the lion's den we have to play the game according to its strength. Be careful, Shakthi. Sure, sir. Where have I seen him before? Zindabad! Zindabad! [shouting celebratory slogans] Sir, where is the old house of Minjur Ranganathan sir? Go straight and turn right, sir. Okay, thanks. The future chief minister of Tamil Nadu his first residence is this, sir, My beloved people of Tamil Nadu who are more precious-- He is Manickam. Manickam, you know our sir is returning tomorrow? The police are here to inspect our house. -Hello, sir. -Greetings. This is a very small town, sir. Not even known to our neighboring town. Our Ranganathan sir is the reason our town is on the map now. How many years have you been here? 40 years, sir. When we were kids we used to play with marbles. Who will believe me if I talk of our past? Did I ask you all these tales? -Out you go. -Okay, sir. What did I say to rile him? Sir, can I look round? -Sure, sir. -Thanks. Greetings. My beloved people of Tamil Nadu who are more precious than my own life. I thank you profusely for the faith you have placed in me and my party. Sir, when I checked Minjur Ranganathan's house, I found an old bible and a lot of brochures preaching Christianity. But the old man living there for decades shows all the signs of a true Hindu. Sir, there are two Christians in our case. One is Sebastian, another is Fernandez. One of them has a link with Ranganathan for sure, sir. Minjur Ranganathan, who won the election, is reaching his MMTK party office with the loud cheers of the peop... Shakthi, give me some time. I'll call you back. What, wise old man? LOCKUP At your age, do you need to be a la Hercule Poirot? I read your paper while waiting for you. If you don't stop with this, news that you are dead will be headlines in your own paper. Understand? I think you do. For some days, we should not give any benefits or posts to members of our family. [mobile ringing] Sir, a reporter from Lockup news came to our resort and enquired about the owner and created a ruckus. Is he still alive? He is travelling right in front of me. Shall I follow him and kill him? Hey! No, don't. I don't want any problem when I am about to be sworn in as chief minister. But follow him. Just update me on his moves. Definitely, sir. I'll tail his car now. Perceptive and hawk-eyed He will stride casually this side Concentration will go out of the window He is one who buries underground strategies never to be found Masquerader with a pen name Charade is the name of his game Fernandez! Fernandez! -Where are you? -Sir. I am waiting outside that Press reporter's house. Santosh and another chap are just coming in. You are following a police officer! He is a press reporter, sir. Moron! He is a police officer. He doesn't look like a policeman. Idiot! He is the one who recognized me. The same policeman who found out my real name and yelled out in the crowd. Our introduction dates back four decades! Both the men who chased you are from the police force. Bring both the police officer and the reporter straight to my doorstep. Take more men from our team if you want additional back up. I don't want you to miss either of them. Sir, three of us can manage. We will do the needful. No problem. Hello? -Shakthi.-Yes, sir. That driver who was Fernandez then is roaming around in disguise as Minjur Ranganathan today. How did you find this out, sir? Where are you now, sir? Among all those people I investigated only his face was etched deeply in my mind. The same false smile. The cunningness behind that smile. When I yelled out 'Fernandez' while standing in that crowd, without him realizing he showed me his real face flash for a minute. The pieces of the jigsaw are fitting in now. Your job now is to fix the puzzle picture perfect. Definitely, sir. I want you to know this also. Your journalist friend Kumar is in danger now. Try to save him at once. I will rush there right now, sir. -I'll be waiting at home. -Okay, sir, I'll be there soon. Step back, go. Hey! Old man has a single barrel gun. Two of us are here. Who is your target? Me? Or him? Wise old man done and dusted. Shall we inform your relatives, huh? Come. Acting too big for his boots even at this age! Hey! Pick him also. Minjur Ranganathan, nothing surprising about this. Because of dirtying his hands in politics and sporting a white-clad false look, no one is aware of the atrocities he orchestrates. You are not safe here, you must get discharged right away, let's go. Sir, I've tied up the old man in our farmhouse. -What should I do with him? -Glad to hear that. Go and kill that reporter. Track down the other policeman. I am coming over there. Okay, sir. Do you know a reporter called Kumar living here? He has been admitted in the Govt. hospital. Govt. hospital? -Which one? -Egmore. -He is over there. -Is that so? -Thank you. -okay. -Close the door and wait. -Okay, sir. After many decades, the name my parents baptized me with a lot of love and care That too from your lips When I heard you yell 'Fernandez' I was so, so very happy. Oh! Well! When you were named with tons of love why are you loitering under a false name? When your victory is being celebrated in every street, nook and cranny what are you doing all alone here with me? Are you scared your real face will be exposed to the world? Mr. Minjur Ranganathan alias driver Fernandez. In chewing the cud of my past, I derive immense pleasure. That too with you when you know my history from prologue to epilogue. Sir, tell me. The chap tied inside is a big time police officer. Find out the other policeman's name send sir with all due respect and fanfare. Okay, sir. Sister, has a patient been admitted here by name Kumar? Please check. He got discharged this morning. Is that so? Dad? What is happening here? Will you be kind enough to tell me? Why are we hiding here instead of going home? Whatever it is, tell me. I will face it. It isn't what you fear, dear. I know them well. Just because they defaulted paying rent why send thugs to hit them? If it is not inconvenient to you can they stay here for a few days? I don't mind. They can stay here. Okay, thanks a ton. Appa, why is he lying now? What mess have you got yourself into again? You always threaten to commit suicide? Give me that poison. I'll end my life before you do. Hey! Shut up. She's out of her mind. Sir, I've informed madam everything about you. She will help you. And most importantly, no one should know that you are here. First switch off your phone. Don't pick any call. For your own good, both of you stay indoors, okay? Take care. Sir, give me the car. Please give it to me. Sir, give me the car. Please give it to me. Please return my car. Please give it back to me. Shakthi? One minute. Will you please tell me truthfully what is happening here? -My dad is be-- -Swathi. Your assumption is wrong. Your dad hasn't committed any crime. He is helping me with a case. These safety measures are to ensure he doesn't face any danger. It is my responsibility to make sure your dad is safe, okay? Don't get worked up unnecessarily. Call me if you need help, bye. Ranjan sir. His car isn't here. Ranjan sir. Ranjan sir. Blood stains? Ranjan sir! Ranjan sir. Shucks! Cough up his name. That policeman partner of yours. I won't tell you. All these slight taps won't work, right? Give me the gun. Tell me now. Who is he? Shankar. Try to track him down. Chee! You'll say Shankar, and then Rajini. Am I an imbecile to believe all this crap, huh? Tell me now. Sir, you'll be fine. Don't be scared. Nothing to worry. Be brave. Hey! You are that cop? Sir? Sir, you'll be fine. Don't be scared. Wait. Hello? Hello? Ambulance? Hello, Control room, an ambulance is rushing to Central Govt. Hospital. Please clear the traffic in that area, over. Sir, be brave, we will get you to the hospital soon. Traffic jam, sir. I'll go ahead and clear traffic. You keep following. Hey! Move, there's an ambulance behind you. Go, go fast. Hey! Move, man. Ambulance behind you. Please move. Hello, Control Room. Chockablock, ambulance is stuck in the subway in Parry's, clear it, over. Hey! Can't you see the ambulance at the back? Save a life, man. An ambulance is right behind you. Hey! Are you deaf or what? Ambulance is waiting behind you, scumbag! Hello, Control Room. Please clear the traffic in the subway. Many people have a lot to say about your past, sir. What is your comment on it, sir? Regarding my past, many people are spreading baseless vile rumors. In what way are they eligible to malign my character? My boss is now the chief minister. Not just you, no one can even-- Impossible! At least he was happy recollecting his happy times with his wife and child. I thought I was such a Smart Alec and I dragged him into this case-- I killed him myself. They let their tongues run about importance of humanitarian concern. But even in an emergency they don't give way for an ambulance to pass. What a disgusting world we live in, Swathi. Damn! It never pays to be good. We should blame ourselves for the present situation. Only an accused like Ranganathan will rule people like us! Don't feel guilty, Shakthi. You shouldn't step back from this case. That's why I feel Ranjan sir has sacrificed his life. Don't lose heart. Do something to respect his death. Come on, Shakthi. Sorry, I just went into random rambling mode. I hope you have no hassles here? Everything okay? Dad's friend Gopal called. He had given his power bank when he visited him in the hospital. Can you return it? -Okay. -I'll bring it. In Suresh's case, how did you find out Ramya's connection? With the jewelry of course. I had a friend by name Gopal. He was a reporter in EETTI? Gopal? Poor chap! He's dead now. Here-- EETTI MAGAZINE I verified, sir. No one by name Gopal works here, sir. Okay. Thank you. Hello? Shakthi, for a long time I've been hunting them down. Nabbed them just now. I'll give you ten minutes. Collect whatever information you need. Thanks, Shiva. Bro, you don't know who I am. Very soon I will ensure even you don't know who you are! Sir, sir. Sir. Sir, sir, I'll tell you everything. All because of that Kumar, sir. We took that bag from him because he hadn't paid. We found the phone and iPad in that bag. Otherwise we are in no way connected to that murder, sir. I swear on myself, sir. How did you nab them? After actress Ramya died we couldn't find her mobile. Her phone was switched off. It was switched on two days ago near Hosur border. When we traced that these two got caught. Okay. -Thanks. -It's okay. Rayadu, I have a surprise for you. Happy birthday. Thank you so much, sir. How is it? Do you like it? When we investigate a case, our eyes should become blind to the lies surrounding us. Our hawk-eyes should focus only on the truth. I was a partner with a conniving cheat. You intend cleaning the city? Hey! Only I know your true colors, da. Hello, sir. Who are you? Tell me the truth. Kumar? Or Rayadu? Hi Shakthi. -Hi. -When did you come? Just now. Is there any problem? Nothing of that sort. Honorable Mr. Ranganathan who will be sworn in as our Chief Minister. Will be inaugurating the temple function in his home town Minjur tomorrow. And preside over the festivities. After which he will be sworn in as Chief minister in Chennai. CM approaching, alert. Star of faith for every single youngster. Guest of honor today, who will be our Chief minister from tomorrow needs no introduction. From an ordinary farmer-- I'll meet everyone after the function. -Tell the volunteers. -Okay, sir. -CM is coming to the stage. -Secure backstage, over. Just five minutes, sir. They want to play a video about you, is it okay, sir? Only five minutes? No problem. Sir? Long live, Chief Minister. Mr. Fernandez. Don't move. Friend of the poor and needy. Doyen of compassion. They are praising you sky-high. What if people knew your true colors and what you did to reach this far? Who the hell are you? Inspector Ranjan. Have you heard of him? I am his spirit, his soul. -Shakthi. -Tell me. -Minjur. -Minjur? Min-jur In chewing the cud of my past I derive immense pleasure. That too with you when you know my history from prologue to epilogue. Is it my fault to have been born in a poor family? I was such a gullible idiot. I worked day and night 24x7. One day life opened a new door for me. -Sampath. -Yes, sir. Jayachandran called me. He said the treasure we have unearthed may be worth around eight to nine million rupees. Considering the present situation, it's difficult to transfer it to our Head office. We can keep it in our office locker safe and sound, right? That's no problem, sir. I can handle it. From the moment I heard their conversation, I just couldn't sleep. Instead of speaking somewhere else, why did they speak within my earshot? Eight to nine million. If only I could lay my hands on it. The greed for money spread like poison into my veins. I didn't see Fernandez in the rear view mirror. I saw only my future. In life, as I've learnt, one shouldn't go around carrying a scale of justice judging right from wrong. After killing Sampath, I could have helped myself to the treasure and simply driven away. But my entire lifetime, I would have had to live with the fear of hearing the police knock at my door. Rayadu was a young boy working in that house. Do you remember interrogating him? Innocent fellow. He was so fond of his boss's daughter he would give his life for her. He had a basket full of small wishes. He wanted to study well and climb up the ladder of success. Give me the car, bro. I fanned the flames of his wish list. Even I want to buy a car of my own. You think it's possible? Tell me. What the rich enjoy in real life poor people like us have to make it come true in our dreams! But there is always a short cut to success. Only hitch, we have to tread through thorns and stones, that's all. If you pay heed to my words, your future can be chiseled out as per your wish. I asked him to mix a sedative in their food. Don't worry one bit. By the time they wake up from their long, deep sleep, we would have collected the treasure and left this place far, far behind. But he didn't know the packet contained poison. -Vaidehi! -Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Finish! [sobbing loudly] Sssshhh! Pin drop silence! From the cup you mixed it to the vessel only your fingerprints are all over. If you get caught, only a noose will strangle you! I asked you to go home. What are you doing here? I have to share a very important piece of news with you, sir. Doesn't matter. Whatever it is, you can tell me tomorrow. Go home now. We don't know if tomorrow will exist for some, sir. Especially for you. What are you blabbering? Patience, patience. I haven't started my counting as yet. I was worried my plans will go haywire because Suresh did not show up on time. But Lady Luck favored me throughout. Hey! Switch off the light. Suresh, his wife and child weren't the only ones who died that day. Rayadu's dreams too. I wanted to kill him too. But there were a lot of unfinished tasks to be done. It was almost dawn. Because he was a scaredy-cat I didn't squash him to death. Rayadu. I hope you remember what I said. You murdered them. I am doing all this to save you. If you dare open your mouth to the police, noose will be around your neck first! What do you intend doing with her? Send her to Heaven. You want to accompany her? Just obey me implicitly. I'll finish this and be back. My mind and heart shattered to bits and pieces. Not because of killing those four people. For burning down the car I drove with so much affection for ten years. If I hadn't been courageous enough to get my hands bloodstained, I would have remained an ordinary driver all my life. That's why I killed Suresh, his wife and child in one stroke. Through the security guard Mohan, I spun a yarn that Suresh killed Sampath, stole the loot and the whole family absconded was my well fabricated story. Everyone believed what I said. The treasure worth eight million that I looted. Offered a new world for me on a golden platter. Eight million. Today has fetched me assets worth 800 billion. A life that began with four murders, made me stoop to the lowest of lows. It is said politics is the last resort for the scoundrels. Even I entered that world. I reached a height no one could dream of reaching. Rayadu tried all kinds of plans to get me caught. He wasn't one bit successful. Every individual has a wish list and plenty of fear tagging along too. That accompaniment of fear is my strength. Suresh's skeleton being found now also works in my favor. Because a lot of new information has to be buried. I have already killed Ramya who knew everything about me. Next in my list, you were the first man to begin investigating this case. Poor you! Shouldn't you at least know the truth before you breathe your last? Now you can truly rest in peace. I'll ensure the rest of them follow you soon. Even now I only see my future in the mirror. One small pebble will do to shatter that glass to pieces. Is that so? Who has the guts to throw that small pebble? Reminiscing past gives immense pleasure. False sense of bravado that law cannot get its hands on you! Listen to me loud and clear. If I set my mind on it, I can kill you right here and leave without an iota of guilt. So, you don't intend to kill me. I don't want to give you the easy way out. You'll become a martyr in the eyes of the people. Then what about my plight? Media and Press will write about me for a few days. You are brilliant. We can finish bargaining soon. What do you gain? How do I benefit? Kumar alias Rayadu who knows your crime list from A to Z is under my custody now. I could have killed him easily. What is the return favor you expect from me? We invite Hon'ble chief minister Mr. Minjur Ranganathan to the dais. Sir. Give me a minute I'll tell my daughter. MOTHER TERESA ORPHANAGE Let's go, sir. Sir, what if your plan doesn't work out? I'll shoot him right there. Sir. Isn't it better to speak to the channel head Guru? Huh? Sir? What happened, sir? Why did you stop the car here? What will you tell Guru? The whole story. Minjur Ranganathan and all his atrocities. Then who are you? Will you confess the crimes Fernandez and you committed? I spared you yesterday because your daughter walked in. Tell me now. I tried ever so often to wreak vengeance on Ranganathan. But he escaped all my nets. Whatever you did you could have told the police. Why didn't you surrender? It didn't occur to me. When I realized Fernandez had framed me I searched every nook and corner for him. But I couldn't track him at all. 15 years later, I found the same Fernandez had a false face alias Minjur Ranganathan. But he had reached untouchable heights. I couldn't do anything to him, sir. A man who killed a family for greed with no guilty conscience at all. If he occupies the CM's seat tomorrow, I wonder how many more families he'll destroy. No one is alive other than me as witness to all his ruthless crimes. I don't care what happens to me. I will confess everything I know. You can record it, sir. Go ahead. So tell me now. Why did you kill Ramya? I didn't go and meet her with the intention of killing her. Just two questions, madam. Go ahead, ask. Madam, in 1999, Minjur Ranganathan gifted you a necklace which belonged to the Vijayanagar dynasty. You should ask the reporter reporter who wrote it, not me. If I get to know the answer to this one question, it is enough. First get out or I'll scream and bring the roof down! -Get out! -Only one question, madam. Get out! By kindling my aspirations as an innocent youngster, Fernandez made me commit a grave sin. Though so many years have gone by I find myself falling into that hell hole again and again. In these very hands that child Vaidehi who used to call me brother died. There is no redemption for the sin I have committed, sir. Ramya's iPad has all the necessary evidence. I have nothing more to hide, sir. Don't think, sir. Shoot me. Trying to save you, I committed an unjust act by causing a good man to die. It is a sinful waste for men like you to live. Sir, please. Don't shoot, sir. Sir, please don't. Sir, please. Sir! [loud scream of frustration] Greetings, sir. I finished off Rayadu. You've started falling at my feet. You'll progress hereafter. My home town Minjur is your lucky mascot. Bless you, my boy. Keep an eye on him. Pride strides as craftiness God maintains stoic silence It is all in your hands Con artist in governance Hands of justice tied in helplessness Enlightenment swirls in darkness World will laud you with accolades The man in disguise with many shades Height of wisdom is creation Height of conspiracy; power-play in action People will flock around you like flies The deceiver; man in disguise The lamp's light is the wick's tip Salvation is the soul's zenith But you are fate's residue Wolf in sheep's clothing through &amp; through O' hunter who pursues unshaken Will this folklore Stubborn spirit slacken? O' poser and pretender, neck deep cruelly As you sow, so shall you reap duly Your past will catch up with you truly I won't let you die that easily. Long live. Long live! [shouting slogans] With the grace of Goddess Shakthi... Long live! With the loving support of the people of Tamil Nadu, from tomorrow I am committed to serving all of you as your Chief Minister. Long live! Long live, leader! Long live!! Sins sow seeds of destiny Sky showers rain as epiphany Time speaks volumes slowly Man with a face of duplicity In the beginning Evil may seem to win But in the end however Truth will always conquer Karma will have the final say forever A false face personifies The man in disguise Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. For the crimes Fernandez committed, karma came up with divine justice! For the mistake I made... [coughing] Kumar, what happened? Kumar. Kumar, what's wrong? Sir, by now the whole world will know from A to Z about both of us. How will I be able to face my daughter, sir? That's why from the poison I administered to Fernandez I consumed the left over. Kumar! Why did you do this? I couldn't think of any other option, sir. How could you, Kumar? Rayadu, we should always take only the good in life. Just trash the bad. I never followed any of his pearls of wisdom, sir. My daughter-- Kumar, I'll rush you to the hospital. Kumar. Kumar, Kumar. Kumar. Kumar, Kumar. I thought of telling you the truth at the right time, Swathi. I'm sorry. Minjur Ranganathan, to be sworn in as Chief Minister tomorrow was murdered.

You said you were coming home today? I'll come soon. JAGADAMMAL JAGADAMMAL I'll come home with good news. When the police force was first formed, uniform was white for everyone. Uniform can be any color. White, blue, yellow, red Color is no criteria. It is said to be just an identity. But its true identity is, duty, decorum, discipline, justice, integrity, heroism. Our country with its share of corruption, hypocrisy, religious fanaticism, caste fury and a frenzy for power and authority. With all these stains of stigmas and smudges, it became very difficult to retain the whiteness on the uniforms. Then a spark of insight flared up and a color was mixed with white. That is khaki. Even if we wear a khaki uniform, we should never forget our heart within is pure white. And no policeman should forget this. And if we do, there's no difference between criminals and us.
