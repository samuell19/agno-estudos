JIMMY: Why do you want me to manage it? Cos you know everything about music, Jimmy. You had Frankie Goes To Hollywood's album before anyone heard of them. And you were first to realize they were shite. What's shite is what you were playin' up there. We have to play that stuff for a wedding. What do you call yourselves? And And And. And And fuckin' And? Ray is thinkin' of putting an exclamation mark after the second "And." He says it'll look deadly on the posters. You don't like it? Do you think it should go at the end?

How about The Fuckin' Idiots? What kind of music are we goin' to be playin', Jimmy? You're workin' class, right? We would be if there was any work. Your music should be about where you're from and the sort of people you come from. It should speak the language of the streets. It should be about struggle and sex.

It's merely my favorite lip-loosener. We'll be playin' soul. See, the Lord told me the Irish brothers needed some soul. Well, Ed Winchell, a Baptist reverend on Lenox Avenue in Harlem, told me. But the Lord told him to tell me. He said the Irish brothers wouldn't be shootin' the arses off each other if they had soul. I can't figure him out, Jimmy.

You're the one that had your fuckin' tongue rammed down his throat! Can you believe this? They're fightin' over the little fucker now! You started this! You and your fuckin' dick! - I am gone. - No one's had me! It's Imelda. She's such a prick teaser. Don't call me a fuckin' prick teaser! Give over, all 0' ya! I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm very excited. But is there any problems with the band'? They were slaggin' you off a bit. No, no, no, Dave. You know how it is in rock'n'roll. Once they get a taste, they become overnight arseholes. Assholes. You don't have to tell me! Isn't everybody in rock'n'roll an arsehole! Except for management, that is. All right! All right! Autographs now, is it? At least I can write me own name! You're a smart boy, yeah? Don't start me now. Don't fuckin' start me. Don't fuckin' start me! Don't start me! Don't start me! Don't... Jimmy!

Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. Can I have your autograph? Jimmy! Do ya want a ride? Piss off! Look, don't take it personally, Jimmy. They'll all come crawlin' back. They can crawl up their holes for all I care! "O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he's done marvelous things." Psalm 98. You lied to me, Joey! I always bought everythin' you told us! But you lied to me! I'm sorry you doubt me, Brother Rabbitte. I know you're hurting now. In time you'll realize what you've achieved. I've achieved nothin'! You're missing the point! The success of the band was irrelevant! You raised their expectations of life! You lifted their horizons! Sure, we could have been famous, but that would have been predictable. This way it's poetry. It's a pisser is what it is, Joey. Hey, man... You know a nightclub called Gallagher's? Yeah, it's just around the corner, but it's closed now. Should we go back to the hotel, Mr. Pickett? 0K3)!- Fuck! JIMMY: So how did you feel at the time, Jimmy? Well, sick, I can tell ya, Terry. What happened to everybody after you split up? Well, all sorts of things, Terry. stilt see Derek and Outspan. They're still in the music business. Mostly in Grafton Street. I try to help them out whenever I can. And Bernie? Last I heard, she was in a Country and Western band. But you know Bernie. Nice girl, but she had terrible taste in music. And, of course, Dean is still playin' tossers' music. Although, I must admit, he got quite good in the end. And Billy? What happened to him, Jimmy? God knows, Terry. The last I heard, he'd been kicked in the head shoeing a horse. Best thing that ever happened to him. Steven became a doctor, of course. But he says he misses the music. Say... ♪ Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah-ah I And Mickah? He has his own band, believe it or not, Terry. Quite a success, considering he should be locked up. Imelda married dopey Greg. There's a kid on the way, apparently. He won't let her sing anymore. Shame, really. She had a nice voice. Deco got his recording contract. He's an even bigger prick now. Oh! Excuse my language, Terry. How about Natalie, Jimmy? She became very successful, as you know, Terry. Is it true about you and her? Don't believe all you read in the papers, Terry! But, yes, it's true to say we are fond of one another. And Joey? What happened to him, Jimmy? Natalie saw his mum the other day, Terry. She said she had a postcard from him. He was playin' with Joe Tex on a North American tour. Only thing is, Terry, Joe Tex died in 1982. So, lookin' back, Jimmy, what have you learned from your experience with The Commitments? Well, that's a tricky question, Terry. But, as I always say, "We skipped the light fandango, turned cartwheels 'cross the floor. "I was feelin' kinda seasick, but the crowd called out for more." That's very profound, Jimmy!
