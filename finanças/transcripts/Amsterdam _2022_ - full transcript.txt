Welcome McFarland sometime in the future when we need you good people to help us out Yes because there will come a time to say enough to these Mad Men who create this war we cannot make any sense of How could this monstrosity repeat itself Supposed to be the war to end them all wars right Because the dream repeats itself since it forgets itself That's why it repeats itself This is a good part but the bad part will come again one day But for now this is the good part in Amsterdam These are the lights right here They can be a little tricky You got to go up down up down up Little flicker for a little bit See then Yeah I mean it's a fake place Paul and Henry organized it for me but it's a wreck She was right This was the good part It was fantastic The world was suddenly our oyster and it was glorious That's normal Yeah Amsterdam is in the heart and was there all along Ohh tell them the same thing The sand dance The Crazy British Empire sand dance She was brilliant and nuts but she was our kind of nuts And so the Pact now had three I stayed in Amsterdam for a while because it was glorious There he was steady and strong She was bold and luminous It was what the French call Akuda fooda

Park Ave park I'm married We can we can figure it out right We can we can I know thing or two about Park Ave Please don't You're listening This can't last forever How are we supposed to live I missed Beatrice even though she and her family sent me off to war So if your country When I first met her I was at a charity event at medical school And I see this woman most beautiful woman I've ever seen Oh my God you should have seen her And we danced all night We would get him We were laughing We were in love I had no idea that she was the daughter of the guy who gave me the scholarship In his eyes this half true he was like you can have a scholarship But my daughter's off limits Sounds bad Who's your friends You can't choose your family and I choose you And this Get embarrassed because you might not feel the same way but this relationship Probably the most important thing in my life Yeah we do agree So stay But I can't quit Beatrice However Sure they say You'll have medals You'll fit in on Park Ave Well this was the hero's welcome I received No I've told you before you cannot treat these patients here It's just completely inappropriate The only reason I know these patients is because you made me go to war You understand This doesn't happen on Park Ave and you're taking too much morphine You stay away from my daughter You are blacklisted I must leave you Just don't go to the park But I'll I'll send you clothes Bertram stay Sorry How can I not help the veterans I had relocated my practice to an alley off great Jones St And got a little out of control with the pain medicine And I was given an enforced rest courtesy of the state of New York My friends to help Get Me Out I had no idea what it would do to them If your family has the kind of influence I can help or get out of jail I think you should do it I mean the pact is packed founded I told you I ran away from something didn't I We That's all you need to know But yes my family could possibly help him But if I contact them they'll know where I am and if they know where I am they will find a way to possibly drag me back and They're very persuasive All he was doing was trying to help the regiment I heard those guys have it rough back at home I think we both knew where this was headed anyway Yeah What do you mean by that Well I mean we we only exist in Amsterdam We you know and you've spoken a lot about the things that you plan on doing back in America Maybe it's time I said I wanted to become a lawyer To fight for people people like those soldiers back at home I wanted to fight for people like that who couldn't fight back who couldn't fight for themselves but used the law Also said that you don't live in Amsterdam with me Yes I'm gonna do both I wanna go back home and fight And I want to stay here with you And I wanna live I wanna truly live Honey I love those things There's a way Right now we have to help her What happened to us I love you You got to help her OK Address She vanished one day

And you were corset like a woman You're helpless Beatrice I can't do this anymore That you've come to have about my scars Do you choose me or do you need me What kind of question is that Now we start Connection 1 today They said they'd love it It's juicing someone not needing them for some other reason Did you need me when we met or did you choose me as a person Was the people around me The prestige of my family and medicine when you were a scholarship student from upstate New York What did you choose me Trust me I asked Bert the exact same question just a little while ago Harold Woodman why do you have a woman's purse They'll make his daughter less Was pushed under a truck tonight Why Are you serious She hired me because we were close to her father That's why she trusted us Shamel They think that we did it and we need somebody we need something we need someone to help us What about the name Rose That's the last thing his me can say before she died at a Mr Rose could help her This would never have known rose That's Jewish name Ohh Thank you Beatrice You're only half Harold You misheard Because it has to be those with a V that's a prominent family in the social register The

many people that fit the description of a doctor looking for his eye on the ground with his Black attorney The woman who died hired Harold to look into her father's death I did an autopsy on him this afternoon He was the general of the regiment We surfed in lemon Witnesses say you pushed her You know we had to get out of there It was chaos A fight broke out The killer pointed at us He's very good at being equipment Well I know one thing I need to give my captain answers And at the moment you two are the suspects Can you prove you have an employment contract with Liz Meekins that she hired you

Meekins bactrum Be interesting My family are longstanding members of the state Medical Board and I can attest to the fact that both of these men are horrible liars to each other let alone of the police If you take them in before giving them the chance to give you everything that they've offered I'm afraid it might cost you your job My father has a lot of friends at City Hall Get us everything

last name Vandenberg was a traveling name That was our deal in Amsterdam nothing about the past Right You live in New Jersey this whole time Yeah this is a big house This is how you live No letter Not a phone call I was embarrassed This is not who I once was It's not who you met in Amsterdam It was from the band You have a nerve disorder You never had that before huh She never had that before We

out Right now he's my brother After everything we had in Amsterdam turns out burden I have no idea who you were You know exactly who I am I know exactly who you are All three of us 32 we know each other the way it counts And if you 2 still have an arrangement then I'm still part of it Maybe not after 12 years yes After 12 years yes because I ended up here and I came back because of you and you That's true I told you when you left Amsterdam something bad would happen I said it would be the bad part of the drink Did I not say that And here we are That way we can get out of it Well it's

soldiers to get knocked out of my own home No just one Sir And that's right Mr Woodman who took fast for Carlton I was They started talking to Valerie and she's not well And please darling girl stop crying It's only natural for her to cry Maybe she just found out her friend is dead We couldn't keep it from her for forever Not so ill that I can't talk to people You leave me here with this invalid

voice She was talking to these men like she knows them That terrified me Do you know one another Yes Yes we're doing deed You're from Amsterdam the hospital they said they were from the Episcopal charities Is there any truth to that at all Absolutely in part part The gal is coming up mostly if I'm an event but there might be Episcopalians there and Bill Meekins was our featured speaker But we find ourselves in this terrible situation where we're accused of killing Liz Meekins which is not true in any way Liz mentioned the name foes and so we thought you might know who was after hurricane help clear our names with veterans we have respectable we wouldn't be involved in any of this Except to help Bill Makins was a A Graham cracker of a man not a mean bone in his body Then why Why did I have to help her Why did I have to encourage her to go around everyone we know and hire these two I did help her darling I told her to come to me before it got bad Now look what happened Yes Look what you did Valerie I'm sorry It's unfortunate but you shouldn't have gotten involved It's not her fault It's not her fault How is It's not her fault Some things are her fault She's sick We can find who killed Bill Makins is probably the same people who killed his daughter We're looking into it And and that information would clear our names And the autopsy indicated that he was possibly poisoned by too many medicines while he was in Europe Do you know who he was traveling with Who sent him And I can help you find out but I can't get personally involved You're a coward Don't don't you dare call

because this can lead to 1 black man or more dead in a box Please let's get going We should have left for Dylan Max hours ago That's the only hope that we have to get out of this situation with the police This is not a Bucks County This is not even out of the city We're making a quick stop at the Waldorf Waldorf We're not here to see you talking about What are we doing with Harold Valerie Unbelievable Welcome to the world of history Sir How long was staying at the Waldorf We had one thing to do today Harold One thing Try to talk to Gil Billerbeck and maybe have an event with This is my situation from my past that we saw today and it's my Peace of Mind that's been twisted But Dylan back can't help us until we know what's really going well I don't know but we're gonna find out Absolutely not You're not driving You can't drive You're one eyed nut Harold this is not smart Just tell me who we're seeing here Paul Canterbury Paul Canterbury yeah the glass shine guy from Amsterdam the benefactor She still talks to the murder Hello Paul Oh yeah yeah How old old Canterbury's parents and how are you Here you go Doctor Hazel Green box of 6 Thank you Thank you Oh it's tea time Is it just me who fancies Claret I'd like to have it go in one hand and tea and the other We're in a bit of a predicament Paul thank you for taking the time to see us You had to do anything we must as gentlemen You disgust me History will redeem me Not have it will Sorry everyone It's all right Drinks on me Literally Hello this way please Do you remember Henry Norcross He's the American employee they don't need to talk about but I trust they wouldn't be here What does all of this have to do with a glass business in England and financing in Washington Well they overlap Lots of things overlap Parents in the whole world overlaps it's most treacherous way if you pay attention And hello Bert Harold Valerie Good to see you too As we gather here once more on the right side of the street fall I understand you had a drink thrown in your face and the tea courteous now Business from England and drinking your face is a drink in my face I'd like to hear about it please and we'll get on to new business It was someone from the on the Theological Society of Great Britain Now Right I was told a story about a misdeed in the Birch Society of England and I'm starting to wonder if that story is about you Our discovery was hardly trivial Yes we proved that the cuckoo lacks the capacity that civility the character to build its own nest Wow how is that possibly significant or interesting to anybody or anything Because it shows that the cuckoos are parasitic bird It tricks better birds who build nests Cuckoo destroys the hosts eggs and then destroys the nested cell parents in the cuckoo doesn't give a damn OK I'd say it's a profound statement on the parasitic destructive behavior of nature including humans Actually true after what we saw today Story about what happened to us Listen up we have been trying to tell you Bert and I think Paul and Henry should hear this too but we ended up at a very strange clinic today and we found this Those symbols were everywhere Have you seen her before the Committee of the five I went to see Valerie as we arranged but then we noticed somebody was watching it when was watching us through the curtains as a man who pushed his meekins and he must have got bored waiting because he started to leave and then we decided to follow him and he led us to rockland county To an unmarked brick building They assume that we were patients for a procedure to be sterilized for sterilization clinic Then I saw the man this red faced man man who pushed his medications and he looked right at me and he said this is your moment to end your inferiority You're going to have that procedure Don't move Pulling values gun finally went off and hit a glass and we got out of there and hit it back to the city Well I'm glad you're all right But if you didn't get the red faced killers identification then it's of no help whatsoever What are you talking about Her It has everything to do with everything Today that would happen Has to start It starts with me Well it starts with me I told some friends And Longview TX Not to visit this very horrifying clinic a lot like the one we saw today A mom a mob of white men chased me They harassed me they tried to kill me They were unsuccessful They were very unsuccessful I live Longview TX and I never looked back It's not just about you in Texas or today in Rockland There is an organization that wishes to do this all over the world What does it mean It means there's a cabal in this country tied to another in Germany who supports these clinics Who want to rule the world Rule the world Exactly correct Who's in the kabal Maybe who is the wrong question to ask Instead ask why Go see Dylan back Ask him why his fellow General Meekins was murdered Dillenback he's been leading on This cabal to find out who they are what they plan Committee of defied The organization in the 4th Come into the fire trying to figure out who they are Yeah I think it would be wonderful Dylan Beck was the speaker at your reunion Since your events becoming rather important berentsen If you can get Dylan back to speak perhaps it might attract more influential members of the Cabal and the killer from the street or the the higher ups paying for it all No I don't want our event Harold's and my event to be used like this by anybody use Think of it as protecting what you love OK We told you in Amsterdam we've come a calling and here we are And here you are What are we done here Or you want to talk more about birds You know a lot of people assume that it's about the the tranquility or the communion with nature But I find bird watching so fascinating because it forces you to decide what you are looking at I'm honing my art of discernment and I want you to trust me that I believe now is the time to intervene We get gildon and back to be the speaker at this event He will be the magnet that draws all the nails out of the wood and brings this House of of treachery down to the ground So what He's please Please try that I don't like to say I told you so but this is all turning out to be a lot larger than any of us imagined The gallery is used by Paul Are you OK You're good Something goes fine yeah You feel fine and all of a sudden Vertigo you get dizzy It comes and goes It first They told me that I had epilepsy I've never had a seizure but they said I had epilepsy and seizures wouldn't come sooner or later But that could be avoided if I took medication And so I did And then I started having other symptoms more symptoms and I said that's hereditary That's from your mother's side So they gave me new medications and I kept taking that And now years and years have gone by and I'm barely leaving the house and I feel like I'm a patient and I can't live And I I'm starting to question all of it No don't touch me Don't hold me I'm fine I can do this and I just need us in a minute here to rest just God you're good bitch I'm fine I'm doing stairs I can go upstairs and nobody go nobody go inside I can run Oh my God Like that drunk woman and God we have pictures Go after the veteran With you Now go or I'm gonna call you I have to fight through these points I'm not getting depressed One chance to clear our names You have to change your medicine and your doctor Suddenly I was fine And it's time for me to leave anyway What do you mean leave Or even if we saw making out of the three of us I'm the one that's going to jail The systems rigged Have I told you from the get go this job was a bad idea Milton told you this job was a bad idea But She had to get us hired Oh she she had to get She also got you out of jail which you seemed to forget a lot You can't turn your backs on me now You broke the peg Broke the pact when we told you not to leave for At least you found love even if you can't get it I've never been lucky enough to even know what the hell it is and that's a terrible affliction I don't wish on anyone I wish I never did find it Because it hurts too much Wait The general wants to meet you I'll screw this up straight up Help me walk I'm sorry about the misunderstanding I'll never mind Never mind We get so many uninvited guests here but we don't want to see I'm sorry I'm not drunk Baby what is wrong with you Are you all right It's a touch of Vertigo and a couple of other I'm coming up some medication at the moment Vertigo once and the world just keeps moving I'd offer you a drink but we don't keep alcohol in the house so that's fun You could put your hat and coats over there We're going up this way Jumping ahead Or another visitor oh Mr McGuire comes every month to discuss something my husband can never get a clear answer about Right Mr McGuire Why do I know I'm just trying to make boy your base Because the general had at once in France General your visitors are here You call your husband general only on the weekdays When you call the weekend That's a very personal question What are you talking about What are you talking about She's pulling everybody's leg half the time That's why I love him What an honor Sir Was it the pictures that made you change your mind about seeing us And I know this issue really in the picture Yes Sir So well I'm a doctor she's the nurse he's the attorney We all made in Belgium which if you recall is where we met for the first time as well as Washington last summer at the BF March I'll tell you one thing that I can remember quite clearly You did something that You sang a song I believe Which ones Well that's for you to remember I I've met thousands of people You just met me twice so you should remember the song I'd like you to sing it now that I'll know it's you Did you ever see your dream Dream Walking Walking Right And then then I did Ohh no that's that's not it Was it in French I'll know it when I hear it There's one there No move Can't do iPad lies eyes Is she friendly Yes And that was it That's right He made it up Well it's not supposed to make sense It's just a nonsense song But it makes us feel good And And you're the doctor That's right Sir You evacuated 4000 men and one day you're very famous Different doctor That's just a social guy from San Francisco Story of my life And you pardon I did evacuate a couple of 1000 men in one day goes And you Sir you stabbed 30 Germans with your knife and they called you Black Death So that was Black Death Henry Johnson But I did get 12 of them before they gave me this Saved a lot of lives You did yeah Ohh that's something to be proud of It's just shameful they made you wear those French uniforms You should wear your own country's uniform From your mouth to God's ears Sir Thank you So I'm general Don't make plans Well Bobby Pins was a friend of mine and it's a tragedy what happened to him and his daughter and it's a disgrace that no one cares Indeed The the late Elizabeth making tires Actually she hired you wine She didn't believe that her father died of natural causes on his way back from Europe But last time I spoke to my friend he called me from Rome Called me from the hotel told you something monstrous that he had seen disturbed him greatly That was why Bill was killed You see the man downstairs when you came in Every couple of weeks he comes and he brings to just see a bag Hmm A bag of money he offers to me Money for what To give a speech You won't tell me it was behind him I ask him And say who's this family Doesn't give me an answer They're paying you to be their mouthpiece That's right exactly And they know the veterans will follow By committee of the five and somebody's trying to do something dark and treacherous Come here Asking if you're sneaking paper push him further like Henry said So if these guys are meeting you and you want to find out who's behind it all why not go further and lead them to our reunion Gala event They might show themselves in some fashion Look why can you tell me Why do you come every month Well General I can't speak about it in front of other people But why not I mean you say there's nothing to hide and it's in the name of a good cause What Well yes Sir but not everyone understands What I don't understand is who will what you represent Can you tell me I'm not at liberty to say who I represent Sir but they are very important people and they have a very important organization that's going to change everything for the better The purpose as I've told you Sir is to lead this nation properly in this time of economic crisis There's a cripple in the White House Roosevelt is weak We'd like you to speak on behalf of the veterans and new leadership Well that's what elections are for McGuire Would you believe in the Constitution Of course But we feel that action is urgently needed Now retired general before the election do you want me to be a dictator Is that what your big sponsors want A dictator No it doesn't have to be said like that OK chancellor Does that make it better It's still violates the Constitution They did this with veterans in Germany and Italy Very successful 18,000 Sir from the Committee of the Five Committee for a sound committee of the five committee for a sound down The nation needs your leadership Do you see where I'm going Sir Mr McGuire I changed my mind I decided I will do the speech This is very exciting I'll I'll choose the event I'm most comfortable with Speaking with the veterans Bill Macon's knew from the resident he created I'll speak of their reunion of course but because I want to see the men who put the money in that bag and I want to look them in the eye and I want to shake their hand Given that we're partners now I can guarantee that you will meet the distinguished gentleman on the Committee for a sound dollar They'll be there to meet you Personally although we might need to be in a private room OK Thank you This is wonderful This is the speech Just the wire Take that bag Yes Sir So you still won't tell me who they are Is that true At the event Sir Whoever offers me more money and tells me what to say and what not to say in my speech very likely killed Bill Meekins and his daughter As behind all this And so two soldiers and the nurse found ourselves in league with the great honorable decorated General Dillenbeck General you should really speak to Tom Voss Valerie's brother It was all that Maybe it's maybe it's modern art Kind of like go over and take a look at it I will have to try again in after now You would Let's hope this goes well Mr Roach Yeah I call you Tom Of course This is rose Let me introduce you to General Filibeck General General dynamic it is such a pleasure to meet you I think you are a man of such honor and strength and such an Such a Truly just so dignified and wonderful and I truly believe everything that you say Living Such a such a strip strong She solicited very excited and appropriately excited Have you ever broadcast live on the radio the gala No Never Can you imagine Think of your veteran friends in Sheboygan Michigan or Carbondale IL sitting at home listening to the radio hearing your songs burned And your speech general The speech McGuire gave me No no no no no no Your speech The speech you want to give I I don't know who McGuire is but I want you to speak from your heart to vindicate Bill Meekins And all those Voiceless veterans who've been abandoned you lead the way And rotten apples Whatever they did to Bill Meekins will reveal themselves I'll give the speech my way I want to tell the truth The trick was to let the Committee of 5A Maguire think The general would give their speech for new leadership in the White House immediately No election conning the veterans into supporting it And Tom as promised had gotten us off the hook with the police who now to our great surprise we're together with us united in this plan to stop it And we all supported the general He was using himself as bait Good evening America This is Wilken Hartfield broadcasting to you live from the annual Veterans Reunion gala Well Henry he's

know the same God different church same lady different dress We're on the exact same side Do me a favor Explain this to me very carefully because I'm about to do something that could cost me my life

life My whole life I know fear and I know facing fear But the one thing I truly detest the one thing I truly truly detest Is cruelty I've been offered money to become the self appointed leader Of the veterans Veterans like you To be put in the White House Without an election As some sort of advisor by popular demand I'll be you These same people Want me to emulate a certain European leader named Mussolini They think he's the type of leader that this country needs The type of leader Who ran over a child And never stopped his car The type of leader whose excuse was what's one person in the affairs of the state General Bill Meekins was in that car He was a friend of mine It was a good person But when he told that story When he intended to tell it again here on this stage he became another person whose life was worth nothing In the affairs of the state He was murdered Yes he was murdered and dishonored As I might be murdered or to silent for telling that story here tonight What kind of country does this become when that happens I became a marine to serve the Constitution which intends for us all to be equal in the brotherhood of mankind But what good is it when powerful people make exceptions for the people who stand in their way Some people have influence in power like it when regular folks are fired up by hatred because it distracts us from the fairness and kindness They don't want us to think about too much just so they can get more and more of what they already have which is vast wealth This is your country This is your country Don't let the big men taken away from you Tech 5 And the son of the bank I know Where's Paul and Henry What about the detective Do you know where they are Tomorrow What they're doing All right 6 number correct Your trainer Ask Mr Cole Chicken Hold time I'm a very innovative you fool because this weekend yourself Probably not my father too Everyone OK this is terrible We never meant for anything like this to happen This is an outrage You're going to be charged You're going to be charged Tom You Yes No Sir You are confused between my own pill and getting shot These eye drops are the only reason I'm standing and I feel no pain And holy shit look what's happening in this room Everything He called you by Your name Tom With pride I don't know that man We just fought that man for our lives Or not Song push lives because he's a killer There is enough evidence I am sorry to say that the man who took a shot at general dylan back on that stage tonight was the same man on the boat with meekins on a ticket purchased by your foundation No need to raise your voice Yours Mr bones Charges The charges are against you and the guests You invited the Committee of the five for what Committee of the five Conspiracy to bribe the United States General attempted assassination Conspiracy to overthrow the US government Trading with dictators Italy Germany 2 murders Your foundation apparently seems to be responsible for Meekins and his daughter I felt it was wrong that Meekins died That was a tragic theft of a life but something had to be done because he didn't see the opportunity of the new ways to live He didn't understand me Egans didn't understand Do you understand that You need to slow it down Didn't have anything to do with my medication Doctor Farias he had done with your mother before Is that true A little A little I did it for your own good You poisoned me If that's what you want to call it fine I was looking after you Your best interest You're reckless like a child Listen to me You're running around all over Europe and saying bad things about the war Consorting with black men Consorting with a man A free man in Amsterdam that fought for you like the clinics Tom What clinics Committee of the five you know what clinics Forced sterilization We'll see about that We saw the Committee of the five symbol there Stop lying that Tom had an angle which no surprise but the horror of it My God Right under Valerie's nose They kept her distracted with the invented condition During Hitler's right hand man and Hitler himself most people didn't even know who he was yet Tom even paid Gehring to write a column in the Jefferson Papers about the new Arian government whatever that was Tom had just finished the topiary with the symbol You couldn't see it except from above I mean you got to be some kind of super fanatic believer to make your bushes like that don't you Look at me like that Valerie Darling All great societies are built this way You live in a dream world with your strange sculptures and that's fine you can have that but it won't make the world go round I'm very happy to be unimportant and live in a place that has love and beauty art and love That's what makes the life worth living While you're building this big gigantic terrifying future What a waste of your imagination I made plenty for us rebuilding Germany I wanted to stand with the strongest leaders in the world But I'm also happy to go to war against them Another war but we just did all that You mean to tell me these rich guys will support dictators or fight them They believe in nothing but making money That's why Meekins was killed because he wouldn't go along with that or supported insanity And we have walked right into it Tom quickly saw us as his best chance to get the general If you get someone like Gil Dylan back involved with your event it would help me to get involved So you need someone you always he always needs someone in front You give it a rest You thought you'd use these men to get me but I used them in their event to reveal you and stop your plan for at least a decade Maybe two or three more hopefully We did stop the plot This is true The Committee of the five didn't get their American dictator I appear before the Congressional committee the highest representation of the American people under subpoena to tell what I knew about General testified to Congress and they agreed he was right Powerful people want is it never enough They do the craziest things My God what's the matter with what the hell did you do Valerie What have you got with you What did you do We had everything we needed to prosecute and now it's all out the window That's a huge problem Now guess well done Tom My face She ruined my face Couldn't help it They're so awful Woman have you lost your mind I told you she was troubled That was rather stupid Now going to jail Valerie tell them the truth How Are you all right Valerie You're shaking Ohh I'm fine I was just thinking about shooting Tom in the in the face I won't do it Don't worry Well that's a good decision Thank God Would have bollocksed everything We'd have no case You have to stand up to them as we had done and you have to live your truth I love how he's giving me the greatest happiness of my life as has bird There it is Look at that That's how you face such a world You must have love in your heart for your life It is love versus hate I love my life and the people in it Even Beatrice and clear non Portuguese I'm in love with Irma Milton Shirley at the office with Morty And tapestry everything in it Even my glass eye Dylan Beck's dog and the buyer base we didn't get to have Each one of us is given a tapestry our own opera This person and this person thinking about it Love is not enough You've got to fight to protect kindness You get attached to people and things And they might just break your heart But that's being alive My back brace that I so disliked had saved me from this bullet We three and helped stop this terrible plot Bert Baron season Harold Woodman and Valerie Voss Tom would not stay arrested long Those people never do Talk to my lawyer You'll see The Committee of the Five Never faced any charges They disappeared as they can do Tom and his friends smeared the general It was a warning of what they were capable of McGuire died mysteriously at the age of 37 He knew too much Valerie and Harold were no longer safe in this country French for life means French for life You do whatever it takes We had to get them on a boat that very night Woodman Thank you Henry I'm way ahead of you I
