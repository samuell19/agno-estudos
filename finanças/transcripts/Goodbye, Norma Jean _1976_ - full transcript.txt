(MultiCom Jingle) (crickets chirping) - [Woman] Is that you, George? - Yeah, Ruby. - I'll be down in a minute. - Okay. (big band music) (coughs) - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - What's going on? That's the third plate you've broke this week. The city don't pay for those, you know. I could've saved myself all this grief if the city had told me more about ya. All they said was your mother needed confinement. Ha, what they should've said was that she was off the deep end! I gotta get stuck with that daydreamin' nut for a lousy 25 bucks a month.

Married as he is to Miss Lombard, known for her practical jokes. Typical of the change in the popular stars, this Sunday barbecue held at the ranch of their good friend and fellow worker, Leo Carrillo. Before the meeting with Carol, Gable would spend his Sundays duck hunting, roughing it on some friend's mountain retreat. The two stars spend their weekends in-- - Get it over with. I said, go ahead get it over with. What are you waiting for? See, that's all there is. It's just panties. - Shh! - Five and dime panties. Now, go away and leave me alone. (screams) - Hey, hey, Norma Jean it's only me. - Terry. - Hey, where ya been? I've been waiting since 8:30 for you. - Oh, I forgot. When Mrs. Kirshner left I went to the movies. I forgot. - Well, listen it's still early. You wanna go out to Venice pier? - No, I gotta be here when she gets home. Last time I was out late, she made me take epsom salts and go to bed. - Well, listen why don't we just go up to your room for a while? - Uh-uh. - Now, c'mon we won't make any noise. - Nothin' doing she'd have my hide. - Well, what about right here then? I mean-- - Keep your hands off me. - Now, c'mon. - I said no. I mean no. (melancholy music) - Just take me home. No! (mumbling) Shh! Shh! - C'mon, don't push me away. Dammit, I spent a buck 60 on ya. Now, I want some action here. Will you... Oh, for God's sake. (mumbling) Oh Jesus! God damn you! - Get out. Go on, get out! The city can take it's 25 bucks and shove it! You ain't worth it! (upbeat music) - Pull it over. You know there's a war on, don't ya miss? - I know. That's why I was hurrying. - You wanna explain that? - Well, I was supposed to be at Skylark Manufacturing over an hour ago. Oh please, mister, I don't wanna ticket. I already got one. - Skylark, huh? Well, I hate to see you get too many of these and lose your job. 'Cause you trouble with your folks. - Oh, I don't have any folks. - I could make this a warning. - Oh, I wish you would. I mean, I would really appreciate that. - [Officer] You would, huh? - Yeah, I just wish you knew how much. - [Officer] You work the swing shift? - Uh-huh, three to midnight. Every night except Saturday. - Well, maybe you oughta get back to your job, and clock in. - Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, is this the right address? - [Norma Jean] That's right. - Are you... Do you live alone? - [Norma Jean] Uh-huh. - Well, I'm not gonna give you a ticket, miss. You understand? - Ah, I bet you say that to all the girls. - [Officer] When they're as pretty as you are. I'll see ya. You understand? - Okay, bye bye. - How about it, kid? The gang's going to the dance. Now, don't say no. The guys just don't believe me when I tell 'em you're a stay at home gal. You just don't look that way. - Thanks Ethel, but I got my mind on a lot more important things than dancing with guys. - What's more important than guys? Still mooning over movie stars, huh? They're up on the other side of Sunset up in the hills with their big dough. Always finding a sneaky way of staying out of uniform. It's another world, kid. I'll let you in on a secret. I was an extra for a while. - Yeah? How come you never told me. - Ah, I didn't think it was important. - Not important? My gosh, you were in the movies, and that's not important? What was it like? I mean, what stars did you work with? Did you ever see any of 'em up close? - Loads of 'em. - Did you ever see Clark Gable? - Sure, he tried to lay me once. - [Norma Jean] He did? - Well, he smiled at me. - Gosh, I never knew you worked in the movies. - Ah, it's not so much. I thought it might lead to big things. I got a few days at Paramount, a week at MGM. Anyway, after a while you quit trying, and you marry some crumb. So, how about you having a little fun, too, huh? We take in the Venice pier. We have a little rum and coca-cola, and with luck... - Thanks anyway, but... - Ah, de nada, kid. But you understand how it is. The way I look at it, it's either a Dear John letter or a little harmless poontang. If you've got another choice, baby, good luck. (suspenseful music) (bottles clanking) (screams) - Oh, it's you. The cop who-- - Who did you expect the traffic judge? - You scared me. For a minute I thought... What are you doing here anyway? - When you stopped me from writing that ticket you invited me. - No, I didn't. - You sure as hell did. You said to me just as plain as anything, why don't you tear up that ticket Johnny boy, and come on up to my house. I got some nice, young tail for ya. - [Norma Jean] I didn't. - Yeah, well I'm here to collect, baby. - I didn't say anything like that. - Oh, yes you-- (screaming) (screaming (screaming) (screams) (whimpers) - I, I, I - I know. I'll call. Operator, police. Hollywood station. Yeah, I would like to report an attack, a rape. - I didn't mean anything. I didn't. I just smiled at him. - Yes. No, I'm a friend of a friend. - I didn't ask him to come here. I didn't want him to touch me. I don't want anybody to touch me! - It's 1346 North Sycamore in the back. - Why don't men keep their hands off me? - No, I don't know her, but she-- - Damned hands always touching me. - But there's a girl here in a lot of trouble. 1346 North Sycamore. My name is Ralph Johnson, Corporal Ralph Johnson. Yeah, okay thanks. (gasps) - Get away from me. I don't want you to touch me. I'm sick of it, do you hear?! Someone said that I asked for it! Keep away from me, you hear?! Go fuck somebody else! Mama? Mama, he won't leave me alone. Mama, make him keep his hands off of me. Mama, make him keep his hands off of me. - Now, just a sedative to make you sleep for a while. Try to relax. Everything's gonna be okay. - I'm not an orphan. I'm not an orphan. Love me, please. Please. - [Woman] She's nuts! - You won't be sorry. Last year's party, they had a big named band, Woody Herman. This year, it's gonna be dritfin' and dreamin' with Orrin Tucker. Anyway, you gotta go. They're choosing Miss Whammo-Ammo girl. Five'll get you ten they'll nail you for it. - Hi, little match girl. - Hiya, soldier. - Wanna be somebody? - [Announcer] And now, from the lovely Myron's ballroom overlooking the blue Pacific ocean Orrin Tucker and his orchestra. (slow big band music) (crowd clapping) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, tonight we have the finals for the Miss Whammo-Ammo contest. The finalists are all here. Well, almost all. We're still hoping that Skylark contestant will show. Now, the girls represent subcontractors and the big war plants in and around the greater Los Angeles area that are doing so much to make sure that we have a short war. - And now, ladies and gentlemen, here's that little lady from Lockheed in Burbank, Miss P-38. (crowd clapping) And those are her honest measurements, too. 38-24-38. Huzzah! (crowd cheering) And if you could say just a word or two to all those servicemen overseas, what would it be? - I just wanna be your Miss Whammo-Ammo. (crowd clapping) - Are we too late? - No, you're just under the wire. Listen, I've got something to tell you. Now, look from the time, the very second, that you go up on that stage you're on. Okay? Don't look at the judges. For God's sake whatever you do, don't you look at that prize. You've got one thing to do. You look at those gyrenes, and you look at those dog-faced soldier boys, and you look at those sailors, and you get those guys to feeling that they're the only guys in the world. The only guys in the world. I want those guys to be thinking when they look at you, I could have that, so when they go back to those lonely ol' barracks that they have to go to, and they're laying in their bunks at night and it's dark, and they're all by themselves. - There's no one else in the world. - Well-- - [Man] Hey Steve, there's the kid from Skylark. Give her a break, will you? - And now, from Skylark Manufacturing Company. A perky little miss. Norma Jean Baker. (crowd clapping) - [Announcer] Be ashamed to come this close-- - Hit her with it. - And now, Norma Jean, if you had the chance what would you say to all our boys overseas? - I... - Heat it up a little. - Hurry home. (crowd clapping) (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Here comes those roses, and you know what that means. (crowd clapping) (slow big band music) - You did it! You did it! You did it! - Tell me, Ralph. Am I dreaming? - Want me to pinch ya? (laughs) No, no, you're not dreaming. Cinderella. No, you don't have to be home by midnight, and that war bond isn't gonna turn into a pumpkin. And you are now Miss Whammo-Ammo! - I am somebody. I really am somebody. - Oh, you are. You really are. - Thanks to you. - No, not thanks to me. I got you up there, but after that it was you, and it was you all the way. - The on my way movie. I'm gonna be a movie star. - Oh sure, and I'm gonna be a five-star general. - Don't laugh. I mean it. I'm gonna be a movie star. You just wait and see. I'm going to be a movie star. (upbeat music) - [Ralph] I've been thinking about this Tijuana weekend. Are you sure you wanna go through with it? - [Norma Jean] Why not, don't you? Besides, we're gonna get married, aren't we? - [Ralph] As Jane or John Doe, or somebody. That Mexican wedding dance isn't gonna mean anything. - Not legally maybe, but it will make me feel better. A lot of the girls at the war plants take the Tijuana run and get married under phony names, just for a weekend. Their husbands never know. - [Ralph] What about your husband? - [Norma Jean] We promised not to talk about that. (romantic music) (speaking in a foreign language) - [Ralph] I do. (speaking in a foreign language) - I would cherish you forever if you were just honest with me. I never like making love. Never. Except for just now, of course. You know, I used to listen to the girls talk about it. Screwing in the sand, in the backseat of cars, the front seat of cars, in bed, anywhere. But I never knew what they're talking about when their face lights up. It's just that, I don't enjoy actual sex the way most girls do. I enjoy you being close to me, touching me, but the other stuff scares me and brings back all kinds of black memories. I like seeing you so happy and relaxed. It's different with you. Maybe I just need a little more time. Come here. Lie down. But don't touch me. But just lie down and let me do the touching for once. Let me make the first move. Lie down. Close your eyes. (upbeat music) - Well, I'm really sorry. Well, we'll try again, thank you. Bye bye. - Hi, four o'clock's here. Ralph Johnson sent her over. I don't know. She doesn't look like too much to me. I could have her come back. - No, no, Ralph has a good eye. Send her in. - Okay. - What did Ralph tell you about me? - Well, he said you were a mean old bastard, but he loves you. (laughing) - You show too much gum when you smile. The bee-stung lips went out with Clara Bow. And you need some makeup lessons. Stand up and turn around, let me take a look at you. Possibilities. Ever done anything for the pulps? - Huh? - Pulps. True Detective, Love Story, that sort of thing. - [Norma Jean] No. - I'm gonna send you out on a couple of interviews. They don't pay much, but it's a start. And you're green from head to toe, so, we'll give you a little seasoning. If you work for me, you'd better understand I don't tolerate tardiness, I don't loan money to models, and I don't know any abortionists. Your love life is your business as long as it doesn't interfere with work. And when clients stop calling for you, I stop calling for you. Understood? - [Norma Jean] Understood. - One more thing. These cheap magazines come and go like the clap. What you'll have to go through is like the perils of Pauline. I don't envy you. You won't like most of what you're doing, but it's a living. You'll meet every kind of creep and deviant you've ever heard about, and some new ones, too. But somewhere along the line, we'll find out what you're made of. Joan, let me speak to Danny. (fast-paced music) - Jesus loves me this I know. The Bible tells me so. (humming) Yes, Jesus loves me. Hello, Mama. I'm getting there. - It's okay, I'll wait. (suspenseful music) (knocking) - Yes? Oh, hi. Come in. - The agency said that you should sign this since they've never sent you anyone before. - Sure, sure, kid. Can't be too careful now, can we? You know there are photographers who run up a dozen sessions and then skip town to save a few bucks. Would you believe that? Huh? Huh? The reason you don't know of me, I've been mooning in high fashion, you know, Vogue that sort of thing. See, these action covers are new to me, but when they offer a fortune for a cover, well you know how it is, huh kid? My regular studio over on Wilshire is just too fancy for the shot we need. So, I borrowed this place to get the mood, you see? Now, you just go to the dressing area there, and put on this. I'll load some color and we'll go to. Okay, kid? - No special makeup? - No, we're looking for realism. Go on. Oh c'mon, Baxter, you gotta do better than that. Did you see that walk? Look at that body. This is really gonna turn out to be something. - That's 20 bucks. - Of course if you want me to call it off, but we went to a lot of trouble to set this up, you know. Bless you. C'mon, hurry up. I'm ready for ya. Ah, there she is. That's it. Crooked revenue officer has trapped you and your guy in a shack. He's got a gun on the boyfriend tryin' to find out where the dough is. Now, the first thing he does to make sure that you don't run off and queer the shakedown is to handcuff ya to the brass bed, got it? C'mon, it's easy. Very easy. It doesn't hurt a bit. Oh, also your screaming may bring some hick from across the creek, so the revenuer he's a smart guy. He decides he has to shut ya up, see? There. Doesn't hurt a bit, does it? There we go. Looks real nice. Yeah. Okay, how about this, huh? Can we see this? (mellow music) (knocking) - It's open. - How you feelin'? - [Norma Jean] Lousy. I can never get any sleep. Bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes, I just, I get so sick of men. - [Ralph] I'm sorry you had to go through that. - I was dumb. Well, I'll never be that dumb again. - You scare me, Norma Jean, you really do. You're not tough enough for this business. - Tough enough? I'm the toughest woman you've ever seen. I'm not quitting, I tell you. I'm going somewhere. - Where?! For Christ sakes, where?! - I don't know, but somewhere. All my life I've been nowhere, but now, I'm going somewhere. - Why movies? Why acting? - Okay, okay. I'll try to tell you. Maybe I don't have much to offer. No education, no training. I'm even kind of dumb. But I've got something. I don't even know what it is, but it's something men want. They've always wanted it from me. I don't why they want it so bad. Why they're willing to louse up a marriage with kids and a home. All I know is , I've got something men want, and I'm willing to give it to them if I get what I want. - Ah, Beverly I'm sorry, I forgot. What can I say? - You're a busy man, Irv. - Ah, busy, tired, busy. This the kid you called about? Married? Any kids? Any stretchmarks? Stretchmarks stop you like that. - Norma Jean's got her sights higher than cheesecake. She's got a future, Irv. I say, she can go all the way. - Beverly, any broad that can get you to leave your hothouse to come over here and meet me has got to have something. - It's something you can't put your finger on, but sometimes I see it, I feel it. Maybe you could get her a couple of interviews at the majors. A test. Ah, leave the pictures, and I'll see what I can set up next week. Meanwhile, I've gotta go to Palm Springs before dinner. Ooo, what a minute. - He's thinking. He's thinking. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thinking of that Hal James thing in Palm Springs. Your boyfriend jealous? - No boyfriend. - Smile. Stick with it. You're going to a party in Palm Springs. - No strings. Irving's one of the few agents who sleeps alone nights. You can trust him. - I like that. (people talking) (jazzy piano music) Irv, that's Randy Palmer. - Actors can't help you, doll. The tall dark woman that's another story. She's the head coach at Lion-Rampant studios. C'mon, let's take a shot. - Irv, it's so nice to see you. You know Randy, of course. - Oh yes. - Ah Irving, who... - Oh, Norma Jean Baker my new client. - [Woman] Hello. Are you with anyone now? - Irving, I always thought you had lots of class, but now, you've proven it again. I'm charmed, Miss Baker. I am utterly charmed. - I mean a studio. - We're talking to Paramount. - Naturally. - Drop off a bio, dear. Do you have good composites? - I have some good pictures. - Pictures, darling. Pictures. I'm sure you'll go quite far with your quaint naivete. - Ruth, did you have to say that? - Here we go, something nice and strong to dull the point of her barbs. - She was making fun of me all the time. - Oh, piss on her, honey, she's nothing. Let's get on to something important, huh? Like you and me. - You and me? - That's right. You see, there's a nice little part coming up in my current picture, and honey, I think you'd be just right for it. - You mean it? - Absolutely. C'mon, drink up. You know I'm just the guy who can get that part for you. So, why don't we get out of this crowd and go talk about it, huh? C'mon. - Looking for Randy, dear? - The party's a bore. I think we'll be getting back to Hollywood. - Oh, I wouldn't be too sure. I think Randy's found something very amusing. - I hope she wasn't something you were hustling. But you're no competition for Randy. - No, uh-uh. No. - Ruthie, have you seen my new little girl? - Irving, I don't think she's quite that little. In fact, I'll lay odds that right now, she's making points with a certain stud in a certain fancy Packard in the parking lot. - That son of a bitch. - You won't get your tongue on this kid, Ruthie. - Then, she won't get through the gates, and that's a promise. I'll give her a test, after you've coached her, of course. Take it or leave it. There are plenty of others. Although, she was a cute one. Think it over. I can speed things up. - Get out of here. You little tramp! All you damned would-be actresses are alike! Can wait to get your pants off for the great movie lover! - He raped me! - Don't lie! - Oh, now let's not make a scene of it, lovely. Always seems too tawdry in the morning. Besides, as I remember the first time you succumbed to my manly charms was in the car. Only, I don't think you resisted quite so much, if at all, or if my wife at the time was quite so put out about it. - You shut up! - Hey, Cynthia watch out for the caps, huh. - Get in the car! Or I'll bust your head open! - Oh no, never hit where it'll show, sweetheart. Or the papers'll know we've had another tete a tete. - Pigs! Both of you, pigs! - Okay, okay, but you won't let it get around, will you, Irv baby? - Proud of yourself, big shot? - Get in the car. I'm gonna drive. - You're always driving, sweets. Always. - Mister, do you know where there's a bedroom where I can... - It' won't work. I don't help actresses. If we went to a bedroom, I'd have a coronary. - Dirty old man! I was just raped out in the parking lot! - Oh, I'm sure you put up a real good fight. - [Norma Jean] By Randy Palmer. - Oh, Randy Palmer, the appendaged penis. - Oh, there you are, kid. Hal. Long time. - Long time. The ticker. Quiet life, no excitement. No arguments. No action. - Business isn't the same, Hal. They're all pigs. Greedy, mean, no consideration. All the Hal Jameses are gone. - So, what else is new? - This one. I'm betting on her to zingo. - She just told me she fell for Randy Palmer's brutal charm. - Like I said, no consideration. - I recall you as a gentleman, Irv. - Oh, sorry. Norma Jean Baker, Hal James. - Mr. James, I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you. - No matter. I haven't been called a dirty old man in years. Sounded good, I may work on it. - I'd better get the kid back to LA. - Thanks anyway. - Forget it. About that sick son-of-a-bitch Randy. - Yeah. - It must tear him up to know that all over this country, in offices, behind counters in little shops, there are millions of pretty girls, millions, that he'll never dip that stick into. It must really tear him up. (laughs) Irv, you know Stuart at Lion-Rampant? - We've done business. - Tell him we talked about Miss Baker. Have him give me a call. You understand, I can't get too involved. Good night. - Thank you. Good night, Hal. (groovy bass guitar) - Yes, you are expected. Bungalow two. - Thank you. Mr. Stuart?! Anybody here?! - Come on in, Norma Jean. I'm all ready for you. I don't believe in formalities. They bore me. - There was a time, not too long ago, that would've shocked me. Now, I am just disgusted! I gave up a modeling job to come here today. I spent my last two bucks on white gloves for the virgin look. That meant no lunch. But it didn't matter because I came her with high hopes thinking that this might be it, the break that gets me going to something I want so much that I am willing to let some gentleman like you completely destroy my self respect by groveling at your feet in the faint hope that you might consider me an actress. You win. I'll be your degraded whore. But not before I give you a message from every girl who ever had to kneel in front of a slimy scum like you for a chance to work. How we hate you. Because you make us hate ourselves. - I want you to take these jelly beans. You need some real sleep. - There's no sleep for me. - You take those, and you're gonna sleep like a babe in mama's arms. - That'd be a novelty. - Baby? Norma Jean? Baby? - Hello, Mother. Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama. - Go ahead, turn away. Can't stand to look at me, can ya? You'd better take a good look if you know what's good for ya. Take a good look, 'cause this is how it'll be for you baby, before you know it. Bev was right. They're after ya. The tomcats are after ya with their sweet words, their promises, and their hard cocks. You know what put me behind the walls? It wasn't the work, or having babies, or doing without. A woman can live with that forever. It was the being left alone while they tomcatted after every crack ass in town, until final you realize you're just a toilet to 'em. Just something to piss on. - Mama. Mama, don't! Stop it! No! Mama, don't! Of course, then we could sell my furs, if I had any. - Do you think you could possibly take this seriously? - Oh, being a grouch won't solve anything. - I'm not a grouch. - You are a grouch. Grouch, grouch, grouch. - You know, I could make 40 bucks up in San Luis Obispo over the weekend. - Cutesy poo. - Don't cutesy poo me. - Let me do Slovak's film. - No, now no stag films. We settled that. - It would be 500 cash. - No, stag films. - It's not a stag film. It's just a nudie. Besides, we've gotta do something, and I don't mind. - You're gonna be an actress. A thing like that can hurt you. - He's a friend of ours. Besides, he said no close face shots, no crotch hairs, just a nude forest nymph flitting through the woods. At $500?! That's a hundred dollars a flit. Now, let's go to Perrino's and munch on $4.58 worth of goodies, and we'll stiff the waiter, right? Agreed? - And that gives me 10 cents to call Slovak. - Okay, cutesy poo. (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Man] You ever had that, Mel? - Shut up, I'm having her now. (laughing) - Wait a minute, wait. I've had her. I've had her. She's nothing. She's not worth the bother. Oh, she looks sexy as hell, but she's a real nothing. - If that bod is a nothing, I'll kiss your ass. - [Randy] I didn't know you cared. (laughing) Hey Ruthie, you like that? - Fuck you, Randy. - Oh wait, you think you could handle it? I mean, that would be a switch for ya. (laughing) (upbeat music) - All right, now, boys and girls, and anybody halfway between, now for the piece de resistance. - [Man] Bring out the b-- - All right, all right. Now, I've known for a long time that these little stag loops have ceased to turn on your jaded appetites. Now, you've been saying that you need some special material. Well, I've got it for you. A genuine snuff film. All right, for those of you who've never seen a snuff film, I warn ya this is very heavy fare. You see what happens is the cameraman, he hires these out of work dolls to pick up some bum, and they kill the poor bastard right on camera. I mean they snuff him out. Well, believe me it's the latest ding dong. Now, if that won't get your gun off, nothing will. Well, if this is a little bit too strong for you, now's the time to blow. Because what you're gonna see is the real thing. I'm mean there's no fakes, and no Hollywood magic. - Enough of that shit, what's the tab? - Hey, snuff films don't come cheap. Now, I advanced a grand to get the print for tonight. So, a C-note from all of you before you leave, that'll cover me. - Run the film, you're covered. Right? - Sure. - [Woman] Yeah. - Okay, Mel, but if you vomit your guts out, you get to pay just the same. (laughing) - That's right. - Funny, doc, but it always bothers me when they're too quiet. Like naughty children. What the hell are you showing? Damn you, Morris, I told you never to show that crap in my place?! Now, get out! All of you get out of here! Take that degenerate crap with you! Get out! Move! C'mon on! Don't you dare come back! - [Man] What is this guy, some asshole?! Shove your party up your rear end! - Irving, what the hell's the matter with you, I just saw that great little blond you brought down to Palm Springs in a nudie film. Are you out of your mind? Do you wanna blow her career before it even gets started? - She has to eat. - So, she has to eat. You oughta be able to keep her working, dammit! I told you she had something. - Oh, I thought you were gonna get somebody. - What happened with Stuart? - He gave her the shit treatment. - Gave her the treatment, huh? Okay, okay, I'll get her a fair shot. I don't wanna get too involved, but I'll open a few doors for her, then, it's up to her. If she can cut it, I'll put her on the road. If she can't, well that's it. - You're a considerate man, Hal. - Okay, Irv. Forget it. I'll get back to you. - Hal, sit down and relax, please. Hal, Hal, we've been through this so often. And you're still worrying about some new girl, huh? - It's all right, doc. I owe her. - What do you mean you owe her? You said, yourself, you spoke to her in this room for about five minutes. And that agent, he's a third-string loser with 10 clients. - In this sense, I owe her, doc. She's like all the other kids I promised and never followed through. I promise 'em, build up their hopes, toyed with them until I got tired of them, and then, tossed them back in the tank. - I'm not going to pretend to know what you're talking about. All I know is that one relationship like your last one, and we're gonna bury you. That's the only way I can put it. One good party's gonna be your last, Hal. Simple as that. - That bad, huh? - Mm-hm. And no more wild rides in the hay. In that department, well actually, you have two options. One is a girl with a very special talent. - And what's the other option? - Oh, I didn't wanna mention it Hal, because I know you don't like boys. (groovy bass guitar) (saxophone music) - You say we've met. - Oh yes. Don't you remember? In Palm Springs. At Mr. James'. - Oh, yes. Well, one meets so many in the business. No matter. You interest me. I just might be able to do something with you. You understand I'd have to get to know you better. Perhaps, you'd like to come to dinner tonight at my place in Bel Air? We could chose the proper scene for you to work on. You see, a color test is an expensive undertaking, and before I stamp the okay I want to be absolutely sure that you're ready. - But Mr. James said-- - Dear Hal, yes. Well, we did discuss you, of course. That's one of the reasons I'm going to help you. So, you'll come, of course. - Will I have to change? - Oh, no, no. I find that polka dot charming. - It's just like a Christmas tree. - Why don't we read that scene from Kit's Daughter again? I think that was a good one for you. - [Norma Jean] She's very real. - I think that's on page 59. I'll read the part of Keith. That will make it easier for you to really let go. And you knew all that when we said goodbye at the picnic? - I knew, but I couldn't tell you how I felt. How much I wanted you. I thought you were completely in love with sis. I can't hurt her. - That's what love is. Pain. At first, and sometimes at last. But there's also joy, and happiness, and excitement. Like the way we feel right now. What else can matter? I've got to have you. I can't wait. Now. I want you now. - I'm not ready for this. - Oh, but you are. You want me. I know it. You want me as much as I want you. - I do. I do, but sis. - Forget her. Think only of us. Think of us now. - When you touch me like that, I can think of nothing else. - That's good. That's very good. - How I've waited for you. Your kiss, the touch of your hand. Oh, I'm yours. I'm yours. - Forever. - Forever. Love me. - Now. Now. - Please, let go of me! - You bitch! Can't you see, I want you. - [Norma Jean] I can't. - You can. You'll love it. I'll make you love it. You dumb little bitch! Stop acting like a girl just off the bus. Down there, behind those lights, are thousands of girls who are good actresses who would laugh at the way you read your lines. Who would give their left tit to trade places with you tonight. That's where people like me come in. Now, you can walk out of here now, and you're finished except as a quick lay for a fourth-rate movie. Or you can walk into that bedroom, like a good girl, and put on that gown. Now, go on in there. (melancholy music) - I'll pick you up at seven. Palladium's only 10 minutes from here. - Okay. Oh, thank Bruno for the proofs it's the only way I can learn. - Hey, remember what he said about your gums the way your smile shows too much gums. - You don't have to tell everybody in Hollywood. I mean, we should keep it a secret. (upbeat music) - Wanna talk about it? - Does it show that much? I was supposed to be scheduled for a screen test. They haven't called. - Years ago, at the sorority, is was boys, here it's getting somewhere in the movies. But the looks the same. The hunger for something. - It's the letdowns that get to me. - [Woman] The rejections? - Yeah. You get to where you feel this is it, that you're close, really wanted. Cinderella at the ball. - And then, you wind up without a prince charming. - What happens when a girl wants something so much that she'd die for it something she'd do anything for, and you wake up one day, not pretty anymore, not wanted, not loved? - What they should do and what they do are two different things. What they should do is go out to Pasadena or Anaheim, and marry some fellow with a lot of orange groves, have some kids. What they do is hang around the business still hoping. You see 'em at the markets and in the stores. Lot of them go into religion. It's sad, but most of them are too proud to go home. (phone ringing) - What if they never had a home to go back to? - [Woman] Call for Norma Jean Baker. - Hello? - Hello, kid this Irv. - Oh, hello Irv. - Listen, Hal James called wants to have you over for a dinner party soon. I gave him your number at the club. - And the bad news? - Ruth Latimer's girl called from Lion-Rampant studios. She says the test is out for the time being at least. Says you need to work on your diction. - Oh. Thanks, Irv. - Oh look, kid, there's lots of other studios in town. - I know there are a lot of other studios, but I've just got a feeling. It's gonna be that one for me. (upbeat music) - Phil, this is Bob at the main gate. We got another pigeon on the lot. - It's all right, Mary. You just don't follow the rules, do you? - I want to see Mr. Dunne. I want him to tell me to my face I'm not worth a test! - My dear girl, the head of a studio does not the time to see every aspiring actress that walks onto this lot. - Then, how can he decide I'm not worth a test?! Was that your idea? - I gave him your pictures, as you so quaintly call them, and an evaluation of your reading. You're just not the type of girl he feels has a future in this business. - Prove it! Prove what he said! You owe me that! - Quote, Norma Jean Baker is just another cute ass and bosom. Would be good for handing out samples at a convention, or qualifying as queen of a sporting goods show, but she is not what we are looking for to groom for Lion-Rampant. - Bull! - I'm sorry, Sam. She shouldn't be on the lot. - Who is she? - I'm Norma Jean Baker, and I want a test! - Oh, yes, yes. I recall there were a number of pictures. What you have just done is inexcusable. I shouldn't even talk to you, but have you thrown out with the rest of the trash. I was as kind as I could be in my analysis of you, but if you insist, I'll make it very clear. Your jaw is too firm. Your head's too large for your body. Your eyes would be difficult to makeup. Your legs are too long. Your voice is absolutely void of color and timbre. And Miss Baker, no contract player here on this lot ever shows her lower teeth the way you do. Now, shall I go on? - They're all the same, aren't they? - Are they? She had a kind of a homey quality. Where do you put her? In a kitchen or in a whorehouse? I liked her spirit, Ruth. - Well, if you just want to bang her... - Keep an eye on her. You know what I mean? Keep an eye on her. (upbeat music) - I'll ring you when I get to the phone booth. And I'll telephone you when I get to the phone booth. Oh. Hi, Ralph. - Hi, honey. - Want me to get Norma Jean for you? - Oh, would you be a dear, thanks. - Sure. - Hi. Horror of the Black Museum. You've got to be kidding. (screaming) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Well, Margaret you've had a weekend to study her, what do you think? - There's not that much to be done. Look at the eyes. Sometimes, a jaw, or a nose off five millimeters can make the difference between an ordinary or a stunning girl. We'll have to work on the bite, cartilage. There's work to be done around the eyes. Most important, I thought this the moment I met her, the hair, something dramatic with the hair. We'll start with the nose. (mellow music) I won't be on long, I assure you. Now, we all know that Hal James never gave a party that it was all fun and games, and this is no exception. He wants you to meet someone. Someone new. Someone who's going to be reckoned with in the picture business. Norma Jean Baker! (upbeat music) - Go fuck yourself. Why don't you rest? - I have no time or inclination to rest. I wanna find the right thing. I wanna get you moving. - You can do that tomorrow. - Maybe. Maybe not. - [Norma Jean] Shh! - Oh, c'mon that's not so terrible. You make me feel immortal. That if I should die, you could just take me in your arms and breathe life into me once more. - [Norma Jean] Don't talk to me like that. - Okay, okay. Now, you clear out of here. Let me finish this script. - Doctor said you were not supposed to work. But he didn't say that I could say good night. Or thank you. - It's too late. He's... He's gone. She won't let him go. - You've got to let go now. Norma Jean, the car is waiting. (melancholy music) (dog barks) - Up the steps, first door to the left. - Just like that, huh? That's all? You send for me and first door on the left? - Is anything else required? - I know what Hal meant now, it was something he once said, lots of meaningless chatter at the parties, but when two people in this town get together they have nothing to say. - We've had this wrestle coming for time now, let's not spoil it with any further conversation. You'll get your test. - Oh, I want more than a test. Norma Jean wants to be a movie star. Norma Jean's going to be a movie star. (upbeat music) - Turn 'em. Right profile, Miss Baker. Would you walk to the rear, please? Would you come up a little closer to the arch? - Name. - Baker. B as in bitch. You bet your sweet ass it's on there. - Okay, George. Roll 'em. - Hey, you can't come in here. - Just you try and stop me. - [Man] Screen test, Norma Jean Baker. Take one. - [Director] Action. - Hey, Bernie. (laughing) - [Man] That's really US choice. - That's the last cock I'll ever have to suck. - Roll it again. - Goodbye Norma Jean.
