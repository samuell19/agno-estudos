This is the train to Montauk. The next station is Southampton. Hi, Nathan. It's dad. I know it's been a while. It's about the farm. Call me back. Nathan, it's me again. You need to call me back. I'm scared. I'm selling our land. Nathan, this is my last attempt to reach you and your sister. There's something you need to know, and I don't have much time. Our family killed them, and they never forgot. And now, I-- I got to go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I-- It's fine. It's fine. Hey, you look nice. What? You do. Thanks. Is that-- They put him in a tin? Yeah. OK, well, why not an urn? Well, you have to buy an urn. OK, well, I would have given you money for it if-- You weren't there. So-- OK. I'm sorry. Um, the lawyer called me. He said that he can meet us tomorrow because he knows today was a lot. No, no, I'd really like to get this done today. OK, well, I need to finish up some things at work. So I'll meet you there. Yeah, it was OK. I mean, I picked a place. It's just-- Hey, I'm really sorry about your dad. We loved working for him. Thank you. Yeah, Alice has been managing the farm with her sister, Scarlett, for the past few years. It's strange that he never mentioned you. Yeah, I guess that's just how he was given he didn't really mention you either. The lawyer called me. He said he can't make it today. I need to get back to work. It's nice talking, Mirra. Well, did he say why? We never forgot. Morning. I thought maybe we could start going through his stuff today, cleaning stuff out. Is that who I think it is? No way. No fucking way. Yo, Nate. Nate, pull over. The fuck. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck's up? Oh my god. Holy shit. What are you doing? man, get over here. off the fucking road. You're fucking fine, man. You're fine. Look at you. Look at what. Fucking heart attack. It's been what? Since high school? Shit, man. Shit. Dude, it's good to see you. It's good to see you. What's up? What's up, man? Nothing. How are you? How are you doing? Oh, yeah, I'm just working for my dad and shit. It's fine. We have boring and fuck. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, whatever, but like-- oh, shit. Wait, did-- your dad just killed himself, didn't he? Yeah. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah, that sucks, bro. That sucks. That sucks. Thanks. How did he-- how did he do it? He drowned. He drowned. I thought-- oh, OK, I thought you said he killed himself. He drow-- he-- I did say that. He drowned? No, he killed himself. Yeah, drowning. Fuck. Fuck, man. That's heavy. That's heavy, man. Your dad was the man, you know? He was a cool guy. Pretty cool guy. Yeah, he was nice. Yeah, so-- so I guess that means your sister's around. No, no. Yes, she is. Not a fucking chance. What? What? You fucking dreaming. All right, all right, all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, so look, I'm-- look, hey, I'm having a little party later. You should come by. You should bring your sister. Yeah, come on. Come on. Come on. All right, it's in my mom's basement. You know exactly where that is. I do know. You remember where that is. Yeah, so I'm going to see you both there later, all right? You will see me later maybe. I will see you both there later. You will never see my sister again in your fucking life. Take a cold shower with soap maybe. You smell like dog shit. You leaving? Oh, hey, yeah, no, I was looking for somebody, but I don't think they're here. So-- Don't feel like a party, huh? Yeah, something like that. I get it. It's the same 15 people sitting in a cloud of smoke talking about the good old days, right? Do you want one? I don't bite. Yeah, all right. Want a beer? No, thanks. I'm good. Thank you. So-- What? I feel like we got off to a bad start. Well, I'm sorry. What was your name again? Alice. Alice. That's right. I'm Nathan. I know. I didn't forget. Names aren't really my thing, I guess. So you grew up out here? Kinda. It's weird. I don't remember you. You look kind of familiar, but-- Well, I didn't go to high school with you guys. I was home schooled so-- What was that like? Do you care? Not really, no. It was fine, boring, lonely. I had my sister, though, which was fine, I guess. She works on the farm with your dad too. Worked. He's dead. I know. I mean, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just saying. OK, well, we're working our asses off for you guys every day still. So-- I know. Right. I'm being a dick. I'm sorry. I don't know why. I'm sorry. You're fine. What? So you guys are similar. Who? You and your dad. Yeah, OK. Thanks, I'm going to go, and thanks for the smoke. You know what I was thinking? I was thinking about going to Montauk. I might go today, I mean. Cool, with who's car? With you, obviously. I can't. I'm working. But it's the weekend. Yeah, yeah, it is the weekend. Yeah, we could go. We could stack rocks like when we were kids. I can't. I'm sorry. OK, yeah, I want to go. I don't-- I'd really love it if you came. Hey, I'll drive. What? You're there. God, do you remember how long this drive home-- You slept the whole way here. It's only because I couldn't sleep last night. Why not? I don't know. I keep seeing him drowning. Yeah, that's-- it's probably normal. It's just this place. It's just-- it's not-- it's OK to get sad, OK? You know, mourn. Do what you got to do, but don't-- don't do that, OK? I feel so guilty, you know? I can't shake it. Guilt does nothing to help you. I mean, don't you? Do I what? Do I feel guilty? Yeah. No, why would I? I don't know. The land, it's been with our family for so long, generations. Yeah, exactly. That's too long. What? Are you going to farm it? Let's just take the money, and get you on your feet fine. I'm good.
