There is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality which goes even more than does music to the sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold a right to glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. I love indeed to regard the dark valleys, the gray rocks, the waters that silently smile, the forests who sigh in uneasy slumbers and the proud, watchful mountains that look down upon the French countryside, so dear to me because I was born there and which I had to leave very young when my tutor took me to North America after the strange death of my parents. Though I was never told how they met their fate, I got the impression that my mother's family accused my father of her death and caused him to be incarcerated in a madhouse. It was later verified that he died there. However, that is another story. Though I was not encouraged to return to the continent, I never lost an inherent craving to see my homeland again. Thus once I finished my journalistic training, I made the acquaintance of an editor and persuaded him to send me to France to write the story on a sanatorium famous for its novel method of treating the mad. The rest was easy enough. I wrote to Julien Couvier, a former classmate and asked him to accompany me on what I promised would be an interesting journey. - Hiya, go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Henri, you damn fool, what's come over you? - There's a fallen tree across the road, sir. - His strength is unbelievable. - Yes, I've never known anyone stronger than he. Hurrah, ha ha! You've earned a barrel full of wine. - Thank you, sir. - Is that the entrance to Dr. Maillard's hospital? Yes, it is. - I'd like to visit the premises. Care to come with me? - I don't think so. Mentally deranged people terrify me. To tell you the truth, I'm surprised to know that you have such peculiar inclinations. - Ha, don't be too hasty. The point is my newspaper's heard of Dr. Maillard's method and they've asked me to write an article. Is Macintosh still the editor? Yes. - That old fox, apres toi, ma Cherie. Are you authorized to visit Dr. Maillard's domain? - No, but I'm counting on you to make the introductions. - Yes, I'll do it gladly. Dr. Maillard is a good friend but I must let you know that he refuses to receive visitors. - Oh, I understand but I'm not an ordinary trespasser. I am a reporter seeking information for his newspaper. - All right, LeBlanc, you know what you're doing? - May I know what's holding us up, gentlemen? - Nothing, milady. Don't worry, are we ready to move on? Hurry up, Henri. - Hiya, go. Whoa, whoa. There is the entrance to the sanatorium, sir. - I wonder what's come over Maillard? He didn't use to have guards, armed guards. My name is Julien Couvier. I am the owner of the neighboring property and I demand to see Dr. Maillard. Well, what have you decided? May we or may we not go in? - Obviously it's more difficult to enter here than escape from Devil's Island. - My friend, I can assure you that you will enter this dungeon. - Oh. Put your gun down, Timothy. Welcome Monsieur Couvier. You damn fools. Why didn't you let Monsieur Couvier's coach go through? I hope you gentlemen will overlook the rudeness of my guards. They're not accustomed to dealing with people of your rank. - Oh, you don't have to apologize, old boy. May we go through now? - Well of course. Timothy, go with the gentlemen. - Oh, don't worry, I know the way. I've been here many times, you know. - Yes, but you understand, the Director's orders. - My aunt comes back the day after tomorrow. I would like you to meet her. - I'll be very honored. - She is an authentic museum piece worthy of the pen of a journalist like yourself. - I believe your cousin has become ill. - Oh, it's just her nerves. - I'm worried about her color. - Let her rest, she'll be all right. - Damn it, Julien. - Oh mon dieu, mon dieu. - What was he shouting? - The names of the Devil. Hold. - Please Julien, take me away from here. Please, please Julien, please. - My friend, please excuse me. I cannot accompany you any further under the circumstances. My card will suffice for Maillard to receive you. Regards to the Doctor, good luck Gaston. - Don't worry, I understand. I'll manage. - Henri, hurry up, quick. Hiya. - Welcome to Maillard's castle. - Then you'll tell the Marshal the buzzards are here, go. - I'm Dr. Maillard, what can I do for you? - I've always wanted to visit your sanatorium and I hope you won't mind. - Oh, Couvier's friends are my friends too. - Doctor, I'm very honored. - And yet you know I have something very definite to hold against him. He has always refused to visit this haven. - Well the trouble is he's so absent-minded. - Yes, come, come, follow me. We do indulge in a little pleasures here, Monsieur LeBlanc. - Indeed? - By all means. Nothing so enlightens the spirit as the constant pursuit of our whims and fancies, good mere delights, aesthetic sounds. Even the folly of love should be encouraged. - I regret to interrupt such beautiful music, mademoiselle. - Oh nevermind, I wasn't doing it very well. - My dear, this is Monsieur LeBlanc. He has decided to visit our simple home. Monsieur LeBlanc, may I introduce my niece Eugenie. Eugenie has three outstanding qualities, a gentle disposition, excellent digitation and modesty beyond praise. - And such fresh beauty. Please accept my honest admiration. - Don't try to flatter me. I'm simply a music lover, a mere amateur. Briamas, bring wine. Oh, ho. - Charge you dolts, charge! - Henri, let's go. You cretins, leave him alone, leave him alone! Damn it. - Blanche. - Oh, uncle. - Save yourself. I'll protect you. - Help, help, help! - This modet is a blessing to the palate. Are you fond of wine, my dear LeBlanc? - Very much indeed. Perhaps more than I should be. - One more point we have in common. - Do you mind if I retire? - Not at all. - You have my permission. You're like all young people, LeBlanc. - I beg your pardon? - You too have become infatuated with my niece. But how can I blame you? It is so easy. Now I shall take you through the home over which I so humbly preside. Pray, follow me. - Oh, damn. - Oh no. No, no! Stop. Please, no. No. No. - This is part of my kingdom, Monsieur LeBlanc. A paradise where everybody's employed in his art. Here we successfully apply my soothing system. It allows untold opportunities for creation. Our patients are constantly working on their different inventions. Will you step up, please? Go. I don't think it'll rain today. That machine is called a silts ex machina, a real marvel that can generate three storms in five minutes time. It never works but it keeps them occupied, you know? Poor devils. Pretty, isn't it? Last year, the Golden Mare was born. A compendium of all musical instruments known and unknown. I'm always touched to tears when I listen to her. ♪ A Stone Age lady curling ♪ ♪ Like a thing that never will be known ♪ ♪ Her eyes are drowned ♪ ♪ In the dotted danger of an injured angel ♪ To your right, at once. You know LeBlanc, I consider them all like my children and this is their home as much as it is my kingdom. I hope you enjoyed the ride. The horses were inspired by the way Englishmen have worked coal mines. The people lodged in the chimney tower have such human warmth and they pour energy in such quantity, such great quantities that we use it in the heating system. They're on you're right. I had to visit several countries in order to choose them. Latins were the most rewarding, because of the hot blood I suppose. The incredible heat that we gather is later processed and crystallized over there into a miraculous drug. This drug kills inactiveness and changes men to such an extent that they forget their aggressive nature. A wonder of wonders, Monsieur LeBlanc. And so animal instinct is conquered by intelligence. But nothing so marvelous as that peculiar apparatus over there. Madame Cronophobia, better known as Electruvia. It's a fantastic machine which generates luminous matter. If all things go according to plan, it will become an integral part of man's nervous system, a metallic womb uniting man to the universe, burning snakes curling around the pillars of a new myth. Yes LeBLanc, a religion has just come out from the very bowels of an electric Golem. The Alchemist's Dragon will now be crowned with a crux and satyr, spitting luminous pyramids over its timeless temple and those people that are now worshiping the crux and building the pyramids feed the mother larvae of this religion. The goddess from the future is now facing you. Will you dare question her? The electro-sinks, glaring hypnotic, they are her infants breeding energy over her whole domain. Time and space will become her slaves. Air will be filled with silver chariots in which priests and priestesses shall sing their hymns with joy, overwhelming living creatures. - Give me the bottle. - Here. Doctor, do you receive a great number of visitors? No, most visitors are injudicious persons who often arouse my patients to a dangerous frenzy. Some have even suffered crises and severe relapses. I see, and the new system is one of your own invention? Not altogether, some portions of it are referable to Dr. Tarr, of whom you have necessarily heard and again, there are modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as belong of right to the celebrated Professor Fether, with whom if I am not mistaken, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance. I am quite ashamed to confess that I have never heard the name of either gentlemen before. Good heavens. I surely do not hear you aright. You did not intend to say that you have never heard either of the learning Dr. Tarr or the celebrated Professor Fether? I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance. But to tell you the truth, I am not acquainted with the works of these no doubt extraordinary men. - Well, as you will realize later on, we apply the system with loyalty and sincerity. We do our best to comply with every humanitarian argument, being guilty of neither too much optimism nor of defeatist pessimism. You see Monsieur LeBlanc, there is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman. Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. - Can you give me some examples, Doctor? - Oh, definitely. Mr. Chicken? Mr. Chicken? Mr. Chicken, would you come here please? Mr. Chicken? Mr. Chicken? - Yes sir? - Here, Mr. Chicken. Over here. Ah, my fine feathered friend, I've come to feed you. Chicken thinks he's a chicken and we overlook his antics. We only see the positive side of the problem. But if he rejected the idea of being a fowl, we would feed him corn for several months until he accepted it fully. - Remarkable, Doctor. - Oh we work wonders here, LeBlanc, incredible wonders. There, eat hardy, there, eat hardy, eat hardy. What else can you tell me of the soothing system? - Well, we put much faith in amusements of a simple kind. Patients practice music, dancing, gymnastics, they play cards, read certain kind of books and so on and so forth and so on and so forth. - And as far as their affliction? - Well, we pretend to kill ordinary ailments and never pronounce the word madness. Let's hope it's not Mr. Chicken. - Give me a drink. - Don't drink it all. - You want a drink? - Yeah. - No, give it to me. - Ah, you never let me drink. Come on, gimme a drink. - Yeah, give it to him. - You're gonna finish it. Come on, give it to me, come on. Hey, I only had a drink. Now we'll go down to the courtyard. - Gladly. - Ah but not by the staircase you know, we'll use the rope ladder. - I must confess, I'm rather clumsy at this type of sport. - Ah, strong emotions prevent madness. Fortunate that you're fast in such an ailment, follow me. - Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy! Look like a Lieutenant and hoist that line. - Aye aye, sir. - Stop playing, Marshal. Show some respect to my guest. Please excuse Marshal Levine but the bee doesn't harass him when he catches chickenpox. - I'll let it all be for the sake of the soothing system of Dr. Maillard. But let's stop these games. I'm not as simple and innocent as that lamb. Here you either enter into another conflict of nature or simply perish under the hands of a sick fantasy. Then since I don't care to perish, I'll have to enter your world to understand your system. Well of course, my dear LeBlanc, you have behaved so admirably that you deserve to visit even the dungeons. Did you say dungeons, Doctor? Do you mean to tell me you chastise these poor devils? Come, come, let's not exaggerate. Now you will confirm the efficiency of my system. Hold. - And now as to the efficiency of your system. - The best and most effectual as yet conceived by man, the soothing system of Dr. Maillard. My method, do you understand? - Gaston! Gaston! Gaston! Gaston! Gaston! Few people know the mannering for this labyrinth. Many were lost forever seeking a way out. Well, I don't plan to be one of them. - Of course not, LeBlanc, your missions and goals are not underground. Not that I imply to have to be superficial. The more you say the less I understand, Maillard. - Mere fun, I couldn't resist it, old fellow. Have confidence in me, we'll soon leave this rattrap. Interesting beasts, rats, though sometimes they attack man. Stay close to me, LeBlanc. Filthy beasts, back, get back, you vermin. For goodness sake, Dante, I'd completely forgotten him. Stay by my side, you're about to witness something unique. - Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. The very words Dante read when he entered Hades. - Thou hast made me, and shall my work decay. Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste. I run to death and death meets me as fast and all my pleasures are like yesterday. I dare not move my dim eyes any way, despair behind. - Dante, do you hear me? Here's a piece of bread. Tomorrow you'll get some more. - And death before doth cast such terror and my feebled flesh doth waste, by sin in it. - Dr. Maillard, this surpasses every concept of cruelty. - Blame it on the less soothing part of my soothing system, my friend, come. - I think, Doctor, you're carrying this too far. - Don't despair, LeBlanc. We'll soon leave this labyrinth, come. Come, come, you have not yet seen it all. I've seen enough to last me a lifetime, Maillard. - But this is the way out. Come, come. Eugenie. - Excuse me. - Wait. You have my permission to stay. Eugenie has devised various theories, all a product of her clear mind. - I'd be delighted to hear some of them. Well I hope Eugenie's disposition- - My disposition could not be better inclined, uncle. - We would indeed appreciate your telling us what you think of certain social habits. - Are you referring to the indecent practice of people who prefer to rest rather than to dance? - Precisely, and you can clear up what you mean for the benefit of our distinguished guest. You may start. - Eugenie is delicate. Eugenie is imaginative. She is a young lady of unparalleled beauty, unusual modesty who claims it is indecent to rest. There the feet are the wings of dance. Inaction rots and gnaws at the root of the tree. It blinds the sailor. The sailor wins the wings. - I'm not at all familiar with this dance. - It originated in some remote region of Java which I visited many years ago. At this very instant, after Eugenie's invocation, the sailor and the four baobab roots are fused. From the height of the baobabs, she'll fall the leaves of the yea and the nay. Eugenie will have ceased to exist and the world will stop. Yet the cycle will start anew, the resurrection will take effect as the world itself inhabits the roots of the baobab. Out! Out, take her out, out! Thank you, LeBlanc. Out! Doctor, the soothing system. - It's time to retire. - Gaston? Gaston? Tonight in the garden, please be there. Gaston. Tonight in the garden. - I am Dr. Maillard, what can I do for you? I'm Dr. Maillard, what can I do for you? I'm Dr. Maillard, what can I do- - Gaston. - I'm Mailard, what can I do- - Tonight in the garden, please be there. Gaston. Gaston. - Let's hope it's not Mr. Chicken. The very deep did rot. Oh Christ, that ever this should be. Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea. About, about in reel and route. The death-fires danced at night. The water, like a witch's oils, burnt green and blue and white. And some dreams assured it were of the spirit that plagued us so. Nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow. Ah, well a-day, what evil looks had I from old and young. Instead of the cross, the albatross about my neck was hung. - Gaston. Gaston. Tonight in the garden, please be there. Gaston. - Eugenie, it's no use, your crying. Come on out here you, take her away and prepare her for the ceremony. And every tongue, through utter drought, was withered at the root. We could not speak, no more than if we had been choked with soot. Monsieur LeBlanc, do come in and sit down. I've asked you to sit down and I'm not used to being disobeyed. Oh, I fully understand, my dear fellow. Your nerves are too weak for this type of amusement. - Nobody, least of all I can remain indifferent to a poor, innocent soul like Eugenie being treated with such cruelty. - Eugenie, you say? Are you sure it was she? - No doubt about it. - Even so, no one may disrupt the discipline of this home. - Dr. Maillard, bear in mind she's a woman. A soft, harmless creature deserves special treatment- - Precisely, Eugenie must receive a special treatment. Can you imagine what would happen if she ran away from this, her home? And the question comes from from someone who knows her infinitely better than you do. Therefore, I must ask you to reconsider your chivalrous though foolhardy behavior. - You must understand how I- - I know it's hard to believe but when she's enraged, her fury is greater than that of a wild boar. - You lie, you're merely an imposter. - You wish to say I'm a Merlin imposter and you're right. For Maillard is a magician and I'll prove it to you. Do you believe in sorcery? - No, I insist you're an imposter. What's more, I can prove it. - Look at the wall and tell me how many shadows do you have? If you say you have but one, you are wrong. You have three shadows, I forbid you to turn around. You have three shadows even if you refuse to believe me. Can you see them now, LeBlanc? There are three, precisely three. And now tell me, do you or do you not believe in my power? It's time to go to bed, LeBlanc. Tomorrow you have an unusually difficult day. You'll visit the dungeons. Pleasant dreams, my friend, and if you hear strange noises during the night, fear not, for your shadows will protect you. Your shadows will watch over your sleep. - Eugenie. Eugenie, wake up. - Father. - Eugenie, it's me Gaston. - Father, help me, help me. - No, it's Gaston. - Father. - Eugenie. - Father, help me. - Wake up. - Help me. - My dear. - Help. Help. - It'll be all right. Don't worry, my love. - Gaston, oh please. It's me, oh please. Gaston. Gaston. - Well I'll be damned, Couvier. - For months, I've been seeking my father. - We'll find him together, Eugenie. I'm convinced Maillard keeps him in the dungeons. - Please, don't profane my father's name by using it when you speak of that madman. - Forgive me, Eugenie. If only I could get my hands on that swine. - You are strong, Gaston. But please believe me, his powers are immense. We are helpless before his evil. What are we to do? - Have faith in me. He must have some weak spot. - I wonder, he's that famous brigand Raoul Fragonard. You've heard of him, haven't you? - I have but I thought he'd been sent to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. - And escaped with several criminals. He came to my father, the real Dr. Maillard, he came to him seeking a cure. My father thought he came to him seeking a cure. - But God, how could he have deceived your father? - As Fragonard is mad, he deceived him. A few months after his arrival here, he incited the other patients to revolt. He organized a coup d'etat and several months after that, he supplanted my father. - But we're together now, so don't worry. - Second Battalion, advance. You two, to the east. Front guard, to the west, attack. You, go up, encircle. You, south. - Up to now, I've been able to deceive Fragonard. He really thinks I am mad. But if we don't change the situation, I shall lose my mind. Gaston, we cannot stay here any longer. Here, you better wear this, it's cold. - Red guard, go. Wait. Yellow guard, go. Blue guard, go. Ah, over there, down, go down. Don't go down, don't go down, follow him, follow him. First Battalion advance. Golden guard, to the west, go. Silver guard, attack to the east, go. - All right, come on, come on. All right, wait here. - Couvier, for God sakes, help him. I got him Gaston, I got him. - Couvier, get up. For God sakes, help him. Couvier. - Hold tight Gaston, here I come. Gaston. Gaston. - Come on. - Hurry up. - Let's go. - Hurry up. Gaston, Gaston, Gaston. Gaston. Gaston. - Help. Someone please help me. Help. Please help me. Help me. Help me. Help. - Gaston. - Look, the walls of the castle. - We'll soon be out of here. I am aiming precisely at your heart with my gun. Any false move on your part could prove to be fatal. - Gaston. Gaston. Gaston. Gaston. - Please help us. Gaston. Gaston. Please man, I'm hungry. - Gaston. Henri. Dr. Maillard. - Oh my friend, I thought I'd never see you again. - Oh, my friend. Henri. - Raoul Fragonard, let's stop pretending. - Dr. Maillard, my dear fellow. - Well whatever your name is, what will become of Eugenie? - Eugenie will get exactly what she deserves. - Don't harm her, Fragonard. - Please. One of the dictums of my system is patients should never overexcite themselves. - I'm not your patient. - Of course not. For the time being, you must feel like one of the members of the family who lives in this humble abode. - You are mad. - Whether temporarily or for good is a matter to be decided afterwards. Watch them closely, LeBlanc. See that fellow over there? He pretends to be fishing for something. He is the essence of the impossible. She, the hopelessness of the unredeemable. Welcome, welcome to Maillard's table. Let the music commence. Beloved, rejoice with me in the company of my fine and elegant guests and watch your table manners. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to have them all surrounding my majestic person. That's why some of them are kept within those crystal prisons. - Long live Fragonard. All hail Fragonard, yes, yes. - Your majesty, how did you build up this abode, for a taste of your future empire? - It was very easy. One day the patients, inspired by me, rebelled. They locked up their torturers and from that day on, the former patients of this institution became the missionaries of my system who will depart to preach my gospel. - Bravo, the guards and patients traded roles- - And the lunatics were set free and their keepers locked up in rotten dungeons. - But your majesty, have there been no signs of counter-revolution? - No, we are much too clever. In order to avoid any possible problems, We have refused to accept visitors except in special instances. Those who did come are purging their recklessness in the dungeons and others, where they belong. There have been a few cases similar to Eugenie's. But she never fooled us about her true reason for remaining here. Now sir, do my answers seem satisfactory to you? - Get back. Get back. Sit down, please sit down. Heed, my friends, oh, look at him. - Blasphemy, blasphemy, blasphemy! Can I offer you a piece of this most excellent veal a la Menehoult? - No thank you. - Take it away. Hear me beloved subjects, now prepare yourselves for the entertainment that I will offer you. And now my dear Monsieur LeBlanc, if you're as clever as you think you are, tell me, what lies under the celery? - Hush. - Another veal a la Menehoult? - Oh no, you're stupid. Isn't he stupid, my friends? Yes he's stupid, yes he's stupid. - I will be the one to show you. Uncover the secret that lies under the celery. Woman, there is your father. - You needn't be so cruel, take off his gag. - I don't see why not, take his gag off. - Eugenie, my child. Let me look at you. Ah, my child. - Oh father, at last I've found you. If I am to die, I'll die with you. - Enough of this melodramatic foolishness. For today, many events will occur. Indeed, many an event worthy of the anger your Maillard has aroused in my buxom. Yes, enough, take him away. - Bravo, Fragonard, all hail. - It will be an interesting experience, Timothy. - What exactly do you mean by interesting experience? - You were born to ask nothing but stupidities, LeBlanc. Don't you know who I am? - I found out yesterday, Fragonard. - Every single country, remote or near, those where the sun darkens the skin and those where the ice never melts will soon be mine. My power is boundless. I know the secret for submitting all men and women to my will and you want me to disclose this secret? None other than the soothing system applied to everyone. Nations of the world, proclaim your Emperor! - Long live Fragonard. Long live Fragonard, long live Fragonard! Long live Fragonard, long live Fragonard! - Oh dear LeBlanc, my lovely Eugenie, what did you expect to gain by pretending to run away? Are you trying to break my heart? Don't you understand you belong to the chosen few with whom I would build a new world? My faithful and beloved people, once more we have witnessed an ingratitude or rather a deliberate misunderstanding. They have not understood the advantages to be gained by my soothing system. - They have not understood, sire. They have not understood. They have not understood, they have not understood. - They have not understood. - Then oh my people, it is up to you to decide on this regrettable case. To the dungeons, to the dungeons. To the dungeons, to the dungeons. The dungeons, the dungeons, the dungeons. - There seems to be no other way. Perhaps after they have lived several years in a world of shadows, they will finally understand the price one pays for reckless action. But was this mere recklessness or rather criminal rebellion? You hear me, rebellion! - It was rebellion, rebellion. Rebellion, rebellion! Rebellion, rebellion! Rebellion, rebellion, rebellion. - If it is rebellion, the dungeons are not a good punishment. For reckless action, yes but since Monsieur LeBlanc and my lovely Eugenie are rebellious subjects, by sending them to the dungeons, we would be gracing them and this, they do not deserve, do they? - No, they do not. No! - So? Burn them, burn them, burn them. Burn them, burn them, burn them, burn them. - Burn them, burn them. - Yes, for fire purifies everything. Water, water. Bread, bread. - We got him. - We got him, let's go. - The key, get the key. I got it. - Is there no way to avoid your sentence? Can we not appeal, have a new trial? May we simply not beg to be pardoned? - Oh ho ho, not very likely. But perhaps you might be relieved to know that sometimes we decide in favor of fowls. It turns out to be more amusing. - What do you mean? - Oh, you'll find out presently. - You'll find out presently, you'll find out presently. You'll find out presently, you'll find out presently, you'll find out presently. You'll find out presently, you'll find out presently. - Silence! Be quiet. - I'm afraid we'll never escape from this nightmare. - Trust my father. Did you see? He's alive, he's alive. - Beloved people, the time has come for us to feed our famished fowl. - Hooray, hooray. - And so it's about to begin. All together now, call our fowls. - Prepare yourselves, attack! Attack my brethren, attack! Guards, attack! You haven't yet won, you miserable rebels! You haven't vanquished your Emperor. I'll fight you traitors one by one or all of you at once! - No, let me have it. We have several scores to settle. - En garde. - No, man to man. - Viva la revolution. - Yes, the tree, the baobab tree. The leaves of the yea and the nay and the roots. Can this be the end of Maillard? Well, men may call me mad. I at least admit to the existence of two adverse elements striving to steal my soul. The one ruled by reason and related to the memory of events that occurred in my former life. The other, that world of shadows and doubt leading to my present condition, born in the recollection of violent events so recently experienced. Therefore believe whatever you wish, for anything I say concerning the first stage, you may accept and trust or dismiss altogether whatever I may say about the last.
