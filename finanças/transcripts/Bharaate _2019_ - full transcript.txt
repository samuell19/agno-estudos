Blue is the colour of sky and sea. Blue represents truth, faith and purity. Just like the people here. That is why the whole city is blue. This place has been ruled by Rajput and Moghuls. Okay girls. Please spread around and work on your project. Okay sir. Hello folks This is Al-Ok the guide. Look up and down. and look sideways. Look at the walls, doors and windows.

I said your Kannada is good. No. You like him? Click the photo. Hi. -Stop Do you want paan? Listen I wanted to ask you something since yesterday. Ask. He has turned 27 today. I know. But you have forgotten something important. What? 15 years back at Kashi. . . the holy seer said something. The spirit of Dravidic clan Ratnakara is back You son will face something bad when he reaches 27. Conduct a Mrutyunjaya homa at Badami's Mrutyunjaya temple. Your son will win over death and bring fame to your clan. Yashodha. Listen to me. God is omnipresent. Go and pray at the Shiva temple here. all will be fine. But. . . Where is my girl? There she comes. I would have lost all interest if she hadn't come. How come suddenly you have developed such interest? It is too huge for your age. Leave it. Okay. Attention everyone. Please be careful about your valuables and accessories Please don't leave the group. Because we are visiting one of the largest forts of India. This is Mehrangarh fort. King Rao Jodah started its construction in 1459 and it was completed a hundred years later. Another interesting fact. His family deity was our Chamundi devi. There are seven entrances to this fort. How much? Seven. Yes come on. This palace are you all here? Yes. Everyone is here. That yellow colour Radha? Where is she!!?? Didn't I tell you people not to leave the group? Find her immediately. Search for her fatso. I will go here. Radha? Please don't force me. Didn't I say I'm not interested? Why are you torturing me? I want my freedom. Why is she so upset? Please don't call me. Miss Radha is everything okay? Why are you crying? Why are you here alone? Everyone is looking for you. Come let's go. I won't come. Won't come!!! Mam this is called suicide point. That's why I came here. Suicide!? Suicide is crime. What should boys like me do if girls like you commit suicide? Put a step forward and I will jump. Fine fine. So you have made the decision! Anyways. Happy journey. Don't scream after falling down. We can't hear you. Good luck. Open your eyes. You are not dead. Death is not a solution. Facing death and smiling is the solution. Death should follow us. We should never chase it. If you are not afraid to die then nothing should scare you in life. Boss. Are you ok? All ok. Pull. Ok Come on help me. Pull them. Join hands. If it was not for my boss then what? Did you have to come this far to die? Cool. Don't scream. Do you think your parents would have spared us if you had done it? Why suicide? What's the big deal? It's just a love failure. Love failure! Come. Thank you so much Jagan. Leave. Hi. Hi. Love failure? Yes. Seems like a childhood love story. No. So a college love story! No. Facebook, Watsup, Pickup, Drop that kind of love and betrayal? No. Nothing like that. Then what's the problem? Every time I visit my native in holidays they conduct Swayamvara. Swayamvara! There was this boy last time. I liked him very much. I wanted to propose too. But he was eliminated. Eliminate! There is elimination in Swayamvara!? Now they have fixed another boy and are forcing me to marry him. But I don't like him. Is this your love story? Yes. This is not love. But infatuation. Love is not so easy. It feels completely different. When one is in love the whole environment supports him. Really!? See Miss Radha In life always look for solutions. Always look for reasons to be happy. Do you know what Buddha said? If you don't control your mind, your mind will control you. Oh! - Yes. Okay Buddha. Buddha! - Thank you so much Buddha . . . me?? Thank you so much. I am Jagan. I love you Buddha. Love you so much! Thank you. Ok bye. Bye. Boss. your girl waited for you all morning and went back giving me a box. Went back! There is lot more to discuss.

Did she give her number. I asked. And? She refused. I got it! - What? What did Buddha say? - What? Desire is the root cause to sorrow. So don't desire me. It will make you sad. If you still desire me, then you too will end under a Bodhi tree. Can it be so? I don't know. But Buddha had said something else too. Buddham sharnam gachhami. Dhamam sharnam gachhami. Sangham sharnam gachhami. Meaning? Put him under a bulldozer. Bloody negative energy. Can't you see me happy for once? Idiot. Giri. You come home. But don't bring him. Boss. Stop. Did Buddha message you? _ No. He video called me. What happened? Sorry. Boss!! Sorry brother. Boss. (Abusing) Giri ! Stop it and come here. Who will pay now? What happened boss? - Nothing. Can't you be careful while moving around? What if something bad had happened? These fat morons! They too didn't look after you! You and your father have no brains. Do what you want. Panditji! A snake has bit a child. Please come soon. Fine. Oh my child!!!! Please save my son. Jagan. Thanks. We are forever indebted to you. Please have it. You can write any amount. Please don't mind. This is not our livelihood. We do it to save and serve people. This has passed on to us from our ancestors. If I do it for money, this knowledge will forsake us. Thank you sir. Take them. Come. Yashodha. What happened? Your faith might be important to you but my son is important to me. I have lost everyone. But if anything happens to him. . . it will kill me.

Give it. Who is he? Every town will have drainage. He is this town's. Those boys who have come to woo girls by putting on scent those girls who have come to do shopping and all others in between listen to me. The sugarcanes should come to the factory by morning. If you fail to do so all this celebration will be wiped off and there will be mourning in every house. This is atrocious sir. How can we give the sugarcane when they haven't paid for earlier ones. It is better we die by poisoning ourselves. Because of their fear our children have left agriculture and ran to cities. We too will have to abandon our land. You have to provide a solution now. Be calm. Control yourself. He is intoxicated on money and power. He doesn't care for police or law and order. Worthless thugs. How can I protect you when they threaten me? Give him what he asks. Our fates are cursed. Come let's go. Leaders should always take some risks. Why else should he be one then? Throw away that cap. So should I risk now? - Yes. I will take it. Stop. Your leader is telling you. No one will give their sugarcanes to him. How is this? Why is the leader wailing? Would you like some soup? Who said I am a leader? I was joking and telling them not to give. Is this how you treat comedians? Who takes me seriously? If they have not taken you seriously then where are the lorries loaded with sugarcanes? Leave me and I will bring them myself. You are joking again? Narasimha. Don't waste time hitting him. Threaten them and get the canes. Brother take me. I will do the announcements. Shut up. Get ready. Hey moron. Wake your boss. Let him see his battered goons. Wake up! Brother! Look! Brother! Tsunami, Hurricane, Tornadoes all are coming together. Come let's run from here. Run!!!!! Maybe you don't have information. This is a sugar factory which has graveyard in its basement. All those who have opposed us are dead. But we still thrive. So fall at my feet and apologise. I might spare you. Dude. I have fallen a lot and have risen each time. Festivals and battles are my character traits. Forget me saluting you I tap on my lap and challenge you. You dare to challenge me!? Come. Let’s see. So you are the villain. Let me give some advice. A man is born empty handed. and dies empty handed. But the gap in between is life. I got it. If you stray away in life it will reduce the gap. If you play with the life of farmers no god will forgive you. Understand. I am giving you a chance to redeem yourself. Namaste to one and all. Keep your canes aside. Come tomorrow to the factory and take your advance money first. Come. Just a minute brother. Let me give you an advice. If you stray away in life the gap between life and death will be reduced. What will happen? Gap will be reduced. Everybody please relax. Let us resume the festival. Come fast. Why are you silent after doing so much? You are a great man. This fair is happening because of you. Let the goddess bless you always. Yes hit him again. All the evil spirits should be exorcised. Hi. Hi I am Pratap. Superintendent of Police Bellary district. I know that you thrashed those goons in sugar factory. Good But don't repeat it. There is police and law to take care of these things. Sure sir. Anyway nice meeting you. Same here. Is this your ring? Even I have it. Same to same. It is an antique piece. Where you from? - Jodhpur. Rajasthan. We have come to his grandma's place. Where are you from? This is my wife's town too. So I come here often. Let us meet. I am ready. Let's go to your house. Sure. What happened? The old woman has had a paralysis stroke. He has brought her too. I was just lining her. He has put a full circle on her! And everything in the circle is his. Wait till morning. If she doesn't move then bid her goodbye. This is not some goat. My mother. Check again Gowda. It is late now. Nothing can be done. Only god can save her. I will leave. Which is the next house? Marigowda's house. - Karigowda don't leave. (Wailing) Stop wailing. She isn't dead. She is breathing. Don't cry. She isn't dead yet. Not yet? - No. Mother. Take her inside. What? Do as he says. Take her inside. Jagan. (Wailing.) Nayaka We lost three sons! Why should we bear this curse? What happened? Accident. Was it really an accident? Did you see it? Ask the one who has seen it whether it was accident or murder. They are dead. Nayaka! Have kumkuma. You too. Mother is collecting all the details from the girl. Wouldn't she be interested in her daughter in law? Where are you from? I studied in Mysore. Was staying in a PG. My parents are in village. I am basically from. . . . . Mother! My son. I am paralysed that's it. Not dead yet. I am not leaving without hitting century. Mother. Look. Your grandson. Jaganmohana. He cured you. Really! Jaganmohana! How did you cure her? Ayurveda. Plants have more medicinal value than those produced by man. The whole nature is a pharmacy. The food we eat, air we breathe, everything has medicine in it. Many study here and run away to other countries. You studied our ancient arts and are serving our people! You have a blessed son sister. You are the blessed one. How can you withdraw from the election now? Consider our plight too. Please reconsider your decision. Our master was like a tiger. It agonises us to see him like this. Let's go and kill everyone in that Bhallala family. He didn't kill my brother. But he killed his three beloved sons. He put my brother into a condition worse than death. Find out who would make him suffer like that. When we will kill that person, it will destroy the Bhallala family. Go and find out. Don't cry within. Either receive his call or delete his number. Call once you reach. Bye You don't want us to come to Rajasthan. You don't tie me Rakhi anymore. And I can't gift you during Gowri fest. What cursed fate is this? How can I leave if you wail like this? It is not. . . Why is your son sad? Do you remember that girl? Bhartanatya? - Yes. If you are okay with her then I will arrange the rest. Don't haste. We don't know whether she likes him. Mother. She is not picking. Love knows no failures. Try again. Mother! She called! Hello. Where are you? I want to meet you. Tell me where you are. VRL bus stop. Just be there. I am coming. At least now tell about your feelings towards her. All the best. Bye. Do you want ice cream? Give her one. Leave me. Mother! Leave. . . I have always detested violence. But seems like violence loves me a lot. Run if you want to live. We are not some goons. We are wrestlers. Pick up the damn phone. Hello. Did you abduct her? Did you leave? Speak. I don't know who you are. But you sinned by touching my girl. You should have known that she has a lover. I am ready to die for her. and I will even kill for her. Do you get it now? I fell in love with you in Rajasthan. I wanted to propose you and be with you for the rest of my life. But it is impossible. You know me. But you don't know about my family. I am from Badami. Ours is Bhallala family. My great grand father is a kingmaker. People are scared to even look at my grandfather’s shadow. My father and uncles will never go against my grandfather. That DC is interfering with all of our businesses! Don't spare anyone and bring him here. My 5 brothers are not human at all. Barbarians. Who are you? Leave me. All those who have proposed me are dead. My family is. . . . Do you love me? Yes. I love you too. My mother has decided that you are her daughter in law. If Shiva can give his whole half for his wife If Timmappa is still repaying the loan for his wife If Rama can go to Lanka and wage war for his wife then there are no limits for taking risks for one's wife. I will convince your whole family and marry you. Don't cry. He committed a blunder. A Himalayan blunder. Killing him is my only aim. Brother in law. I have found them. Come. Bring them and come. Come Who is he? Confirmed. I was waiting for this. Now I will show him. I will show him what hunting, fear and what this Pallava means! Forget confronting this Bhallala Even looking into his eyes is a crime And to think you can challenge me is a bigger crime. Boss. Her family history scares me. Why did you make such promise? What next? One who has strength will build a fort. One who has attitude will put a flag on it. One who has guts will fight and one with skills will defend. But in life only when you possess all four will have Bharate (clout) One has to think a hundred times about the opponent's strength before confronting him. I can beckon Chikkodi in a snap and Kalburgi in a twitch. I can command Gulbarga in a stare and Badami on a call! We have ruled over these land and people for over 400 years. This Bhallala clan! We own the bed of a river and even the sky above hills. That is none of your business. Since you were unaware of these rules I shall only chop your hand. Or else it would have been your head. Shoo them away after compensating. Take it and flee. Did you do well in your exams? -Yes Your daughter has come from Hassan instead of Mysore. She has started to lie. She should be married soon. How are you Radha? Stop! What the. . . Give it. Shouldn't you ward off the evil eyes cast on the child? Let the evil eyes of dogs, foxes, of YouTube and Facebook be thwarted away from my child. Spit out. Not on me! Come in now. All arrangements have been made for your Swayamvara I have handpicked some candidates too. Your marriage is fixed this time. Why such sighs? Sadhu! She is tired after a long journey. Let her rest. Sorry. Let the caravan go. Take rest. They killed my three colleagues for no reason! In spite of that I never revealed your name They are not human sir. You shouldn't mix with them. Give up this hatred. What do you know about me? Do you know how happy I was with my family? Just for an acre of land he declared my mining activity as illegal and locked it. They arrested my children and my father before my eyes! They returned as corpse! When I asked they said, they hung themselves! My wife committed suicide in this agony. This broke my mother and she too had a heart attack. My only son is in coma. I don't know whether he will live or not. Though I have billions of money I live with my servants. And I should give up hate! I will disturb those who disturb me. It should rain corpses in that house. Leave. Rudra. What happened? Puncture! Tyre punctures. We will be at the dhaba. Come soon. Sure sir. You leave. No Grandpa. Let me see. Stop it. Bloody hell. If you kill them all of sudden they will be confused. They should know why they died. Let me introduce myself. I am Supari Shankar. A royal family has paid me heftily to kill you. Now all these people here will chop you into pieces. You will die! Clear! Sure. Happy journey. Leave me. Leave him uncle. Please. What the hell. Bloody sentiments! It irks me. Take care of that girl first. Leave me. Leave her. Grandpa! Hello This is Supari Shankar here. You will be a dead meat. The deal has been given by a royal family. Do you get it? Flee. Smile! So you are not the one who listens to words. First take him out. One who has money is not royal. One who has guts is royal. I am royal by birth. Girls never cry. Chocolate? Brother let's run from here. Thanks sir. For saving our lives. Don't mention. Who are you? I am a tourist. Ours is the biggest clan in the vicinity. I implore you to be our guest. Thanks for the invite. But I have some work. Please don't mind. Uncle please come. I will come next time. Please. Let's go boss. You shouldn't deny a girl's request He is. . . . - His friend. I had been on an emergency. So much has happened in between. After his command I should go. Sure. Please come. Desai has transferred the land papers dad. . . You are bleeding! Speak. Who was it? He was the one who saved us. If he had not been there it would have been our end. Please come. You didn't save just 5 lives You saved our lives too. If something bad would have happened then even we would have ended our lives. Don't feel shy. Think this as your house. Fine. Take him inside. Please come. Stop there. Saviour!. Yes uncle. It looks like he himself had sent those goons and later hit them to make an impression! Look at his face. Looks like a thief! Why is he humiliating your guests? Guests! -Yes. Please don't mind. He is not of sound mind. Every family has one. It is common. Jagan. Nice meeting you. Show them the room. -Yes sir. See. This is our big house. This is your room. Giri bro. -Yes. Take rest. I will come soon. What are you up to? I am going to meet Buddha. - Buddha! Hi. Hi. You! Me. Why are you tensed? Why did you come here? To meet you. If my brothers see you, you are done for. Your brother himself has invited me. Doubt? Let me clarify. Hello sir. A minute please. Yes. I came to pray to Buddha But got confused with the rooms. Is this or that my room? Third one at the left. Thank you. Sorry I didn't get know her. Sorry. This is my sister Radha. Namaste. This is Jagan. Our guest. He will be with us for couple of days. You should take good care of him. Let me walk to your room. Brother! What?! Shouldn't you pray to Buddha? If grandpa even gets a hint about him then it would be a disaster. Smile please. Why have you come here? Get out. What if I don't go? Don't come near. What if I come near? I will scream. Scream. Brother. Brother. You call that a scream! Let me show you. Brother. Didn't your brother tell? To take good care of me? So show your hospitality. Don't come near. Don't kiss me. -Kiss! Me? No no. You give it. No way. If you wait for winter to hold hands for rainy days to hug and sunny days to look at our faces then even after 70 years of marriage we will be childless. Since we have decided to marry you should not hesitate to kiss. Loan me some kisses. I will repay it with interest. He came like a prince to free me from my fears. I love him unconditionally and I can't be away from him. He lit the lamp of hope in this hut of my heart and kissed me. This charming prince. Were you born only for me! Can I be with you till the end? This life is yours. Why are you surprised? I will hold your hand for all the seven lives. He came like a prince to free me from my fears. The lord of the high mountains! guards me each day. He is as pristine as Kohinoor. With just one look at him My heart has skipped all its beats. He is my knight in a shining armour. Who will brave many battles for me. My unconquerable prince charming. I will take you in high raised chariots and protect you till the end. This life is yours. Why are you surprised? I will hold your hands for all seven lives. My crimson red sun on my forehead. Is my only solace in life. He can defeat elephants with his gaze . His anger can scare lightening. He can catch swirling meteors. He can just charm the whole world in a smile. He is selfless. He yearns for love. He is adored by all. This charming prince of mine. I will make a chain of kisses. And garland you with it everyday. This life is yours. Why are you surprised? I will hold your hands for all seven lives. Salutations everyone. From ages We have been practicing Swayamvara to select the grooms for our girls. Look at this gold. Wow! Please be seated. After six months of pursuance, after analysing 3 lakh application, we boiled down to first 30,000 then 3000 and finally we finalised these three. He thinks he is Amitabh Bachchan of KBC. Let me come to the point. The winner will get a palace our girl and permanent residence in our house. Like me. Sister in law let's proceed if you are ready. Start. First round. Round no one. A challenge to your skill and intelligence. What will you do if our girl falls sick? That's easy. Actually if she does a Google search, she will get all the prescriptions for the illness. But if the problem is serious she can book an Ola or Uber and go to the nearest clinic. But if it is more serious than that then I know the best doctors in the world. She can go on Facebook live and take prescriptions from them. Not a big deal. Most updated lousy lazy fellow. Did you even for once say that I will take her to the hospital? I will take her! You? Sir, a nephew of my paternal uncle's maternal uncle has a hospital adjacent to his house. They even give 50% discount. If we go a little ahead my maternal uncle's paternal father in law owns a clinic. They give 75% discount. A little more ahead is a government hospital. Now you know about my influence. Of course I do. They will give free treatment. And if you go further ahead you get hell. Sit down. Next. I prefer ayurvedic home medicine. Oh no side effects! First you should take 30. A 60 later. Then you should have 90. That will cure all the illness. Is this ayurvedic or homeopathic? It is better than that. Paan-a-pati. Peen-a-pati. I didn't get it. Alcohol. Alcohol is the medicine to all illness. It is our family prescription too. All three have failed. Not even one said that they will take such good care of her that she won't fall sick? This is wrong. What? Me! You are asking the wrong question. How? Let us think practically. Everyone from a child to elderly fall sick. The flora and fauna too fall sick. Haven't you fallen sick? Correct? Absolutely right. Forget correct. Audience should just sit and clap. They are not allowed to play. Sit down. Then I will be the player. How can you be a player? A wild card entry. Wild card! This is not Big-Boss. But Swayamvara. Just sit down. Are you afraid to compete? Sit. Sadhu, he is right. Include him too. But. . . Let him compete. Let him. Wow! A new groom's entry! He has charmed the whole family. Let me handle him in the second round. Round two. Namaste. A challenge for your concern. Presume that we get our girl married to you. How will you make sure that she is never bored? I know lot of jokes. I can make her laugh. Really! Please crack one. One second. Hey Google, tell me a joke. Bloody Google! You tell one. I am very talented you know. I know pole dancing. And yes! I know strip dancing too. Show us a bit. When I sensually dance like this and strip my clothes one by one What is he doing? and when I move closer Stripping is romance. Just sit. Thank god he didn't strip his pants. Sir, I have a big plasma TV. Very good. My distant cousin is a councilor. By his influence I have put a round dish on our terrace. We have a 24 hour broadcast of all channels. She can keep on watching it. She will never be bored. Never be bored, is it? Even then if she is bored, I have DVDs of all the movies from Dr.Rajkumar to Amitabh Bachchan. It will last for five years. She will never be bore. . . - Just sit. Bloody fools. You dog. Loafer. Either say it and laugh or else finish your laughter. No one said that I will take such care of her that she will never be bored I will take such care. You are repeating my own dialogue to me? Waste. What is your take sir? Wrong sir. Wrong!? How? You are again asking wrong questions. How is my question wrong? If she marries me, boredom! Mr. Giri - Boss Please. It is like this. -How? When boss marries her, the girl is housewife By the time he wakes at 6 gets ready and makes breakfast, it will be 10. In this gap she will glance a serial and make lunch for noon? By the time she finishes her afternoon chores, it will be 4 in the evening Then she will watch another serial then she will go for shopping groceries and return to make dinner. It will be 10 at night. Then she will massage boss's body and both of them will sleep. This is their daily routine. There will be extra duty on festivals. Now where is time for boredom. Claps please. He makes sense! If our girl marries your boss you will make her your housemaid. You are eliminated. Eliminated! Why? How can he answer to your question? You are eliminated. Why is he eliminated? I oppose this. We too oppose it. You are opposing me!? How can he rule in our court?. . Hey Google! Where is the fire exit? Start the vehicle. I want to go. Use all your influence. Shut up. It is of no use. I will show the true colour of this house. Bloody traitors. We are sorry my lord. Please forgive us. Who ordered the kill? I won't tell. Who ordered the kill? For the sake of my children please tell him. Are you tone deaf? I won't tell. Who ordered the kill? Brother please I beg of you. I won't tell even if you kill me. Who? Sir! I have seen people butchering hens and goats But these are butchering humans! So rude! Rowdy old man! We should be careful. Can influence work with them? You should have that fear. It is not easy to leave from here. Hello. Don't show off your talents. Be silent. Do you get it? Come in. I had warned him not to indulge. But he ignored and died. He adored you a lot. He never revealed your name. He was a tiger. He took care of all of us. Now who shall take care of us? Please compensate us. Compensation! - Yes. How much? 2 crores. That bugger died without finishing the job. How can you ask compensation for that? Well the media is waiting outside. They will get us compensation. Are you extorting now? Give. Why is he bringing the bowl instead of suitcase? They are rich right? They might pay in gold or diamonds How many times have I told you? To not feed the street dogs. Now Bhallala has become cautious. We can't delay now. Not just those in the house His whole lineage would become extinct. Order Brother in law. I will bomb his house. Bloody fool! If you bomb or shoot him they will not what pain is. He should be tortured to death. His blood stains shouldn't be wiped off for centuries. Tell me what to do? Bring them. Bring them from Bihar. This is my granddaughter Radha. Look at him nicely. He is your would be husband. What are you doing here? Isn't it late for Swayamvara? Come. Who is he? He is dressed like a magician! Yes sir. He is sort of a magician. He is our resident son in law. He wears this type of dress and keeps joking about conducting Swayamvara for my daughter. JOKE!!!!!! It is a pleasure to be related to such family. We can do the engagement at your will and whim. I will look for an auspicious moment and intimate you about the date. Spare me. I had come from America for this. I am not going to leave you you cheat! Even though I was healthy, I lied about my health and had taken sick leave for month. Now what should I do? I had left my business There were so many who were willing to give me their daughter in marriage! Now I have lost those and don't have this one also! Even I had left everything and was in this pursuance for past two years! It is only now that I realise that this house considers me as a clown! You want to vent out your anger on me? Hit me. I myself will vent out all the frustration on me! You don't know about my grandpa. He will never yield to our love. Our dream of being together can never be true. Forget me and move on. I beg of you. Please leave me and go away. This house has beheaded every head that rose against it. They value blood more than love. Go away. Leave. What happened to me was fine. But yours was atrocious. Going in one way and getting hit is understandable. How does one get hit on two ways lane? Don't stress. A girls tear are more powerful than Shiva's trident, Vishnu's chakra Rama's arrow. Correct. That's why I gave up. Forget her. Forgetting her? I can't forget ABCD. Then how can I forget my lady? How can you say it so callously? I came this far risking my life and this is how I am treated! Kindly adjust. What to adjust dude? Dude! Only men become devdas. Has any girl become one? No adjustment mama Mama! My love story is over. I will leave tomorrow morning. Don't stop me dawg. Wow! What an honour!? You started with sir and made me dawg! My dignity and respect keeps declining step by step. Raise your peg before you start talking in beep language. I am frustrated darling. I need entertainment. Now what should I do? Dance' - What? Me! What is the use if I dance? To entertain frustrated boys like you, there are exotic dancers ready to do it. Bottom sip! After making everyone happy the whole day I am fed up and bored. Isn't there anyone here who would make me happy and make my day. Yes! My boy will make you happy. He will make you and every sad soul here happy. Go. Go make her happy. This song is dedicated to all depressed people. Shun this depression. Find your solution. No tension. Life is a big confusion. Make it a celebration. No tension. How much will you cry over fate now? Smile while god has a plan for you. Now raise the sound. barabara raate Bumbumbum Bharate. barabara raate Show me your Bharate (clout) barabara raate. Only the brave have Bharate (clout). barabara raate.

If your luck is lopsided If your ex becomes mother If you are duped to the core If you start having thoughts at midnight If a dumb school dropout wins in an election If the nice guy of the town abandons the town and leaves it Then make a lot of sound. barabara raate Bumbumbum bharate barabara raate Show me your Bharate (clout) barabara raate One who dares has Bharate. (Clout) Barabara raate One who wins has Bharate. (clout) Only once in a year, the Bhallalas will be unarmed During Ayudha pooja. They will be celebrating Ayudha pooja at 11 a.m. At 12, they will come to Navadurgi bali peeta. Bhallala will be under oath. He won't raise his hand till the fire ceremony. You will attack at 12:30. By 1 p.m. they will all be dead. And by 2 p.m. we will have party at our house. I want no excuses. We are Biharis. Once we promise nothing can make us break it. Jai Bihari! Don't disturb. You are not on our list. Leave. If you truly have guts If you really have enmity Then before even touching this family Cross me first. Are you threatening? We are not Kannadigas to be scared. We are Biharis. Before talking about Kannadigas learn about Karnataka If you get water consider it teertha. (holy) If you get rice consider it prasada. If you get place to walk walk as if you would walk in a temple. Bravery is in every drop of blood in a Kannadiga. That is my prey. I will strike and secure it. Even the god of death can't cross me on this. Don't try to cross me. You shouldn't have left him. I would have killed him in a single shot. A tiger chases its prey all by itself. I will hunt him. I will hunt like a pro. You killed one monster. But you saved a bigger one. I wanted to talk about it. Why did you kill him? Who are you? Today the whole village is celebrating. But it is a day of mourning for me. I lost my two brothers this day. I saw twelve deaths on this day. My grandfather who was revered by the whole district was killed today. Do you even know about my family? Help! My son is bitten by a snake! He is the son of this soil. The great philanthropist. His heart is of pure gold. The great scholar. He was born to serve the masses. He belongs to the lineage of gods. His shadow itself is strength equivalent to hundred elephants. Even this land is indebted to him. Every breath owes him a favour. Jai Ratnakara. He is the son of this soil. The great philanthropist. His heart is of pure gold. A great scholar. Chandra Choodamani Vajra Nagamani He is the mining belt of gold and diamonds. He is the lord who resides in the heart of people. The crown jewel of Kannada. A divine saint The supreme protector This land cannot be enough grateful. God of death will bow down to you. This earth is blessed by you. A sacred cow will be only one in a crore But every cow is sacred for him. He is the mirror image of justice. A prologue for truth and righteousness. Jai Ratnakara! His life has brought essence to every word he speaks. Let your tribe be happy always. Let you be blessed with our remaining years. He is the lord who has descended to free us from our pains. The rains fall down to touch you. The earth blossoms to feel you. He knows no discrimination. He is a king with a mother's heart. Like holy Ganga he absolves all our sins. Jai Ratnakara! I will do it. You relax. Namaste sir. Give me happy news. All the districts have your candidates. And this time too your candidate will become CM. But one constituency is not falling in line. That Ratnakara family in Badami this was the family physician of Krishnadevaraya was crowned as Ratnakara from Raya himself More than money they have earned deep loyalty from people. Now Mahabala Ratnakara's son is standing for election. So that constituency is little problematic. What a mansion! We consent this marriage. We will arrange the marriage on your preferred day. More than my preference I need to ask about my girl's preference. Do you consent to this marriage? No. Did I ask to see the girl? How can she reject me? Control yourself. Leave her. What? Leave her! I won't spare her. What happened? How dare you reject me? Leave me. How dare you humiliate me? I will leave. My lord Those Ratnakars have killed your son. Leave me. Stop it. To avenge one death you have killed eleven people! Stop it. If you kill everyone you won't be destroying one family. You will destroy a rich heritage. We have been serving people for ages. If we are no more then it will be loss to the whole society. We have never taken a life. We save lives. This is enough. Leave it. Leave it! People don't even step on our shadows. And you. . . . I will give up. But you have to compensate. Will you compensate for my loss? Ask. One You will give all your wealth to me. Two. If either your son, daughter in law or grandson comes before me, I will kill them. Three The crown jewel of Ratnakara clan this Mahabala Ratnkara will give his head to me. What? Should we leave our own house fearing them? Just say it. I will kill each one of them. That is not some achievement. If you do that there won't be any difference between us. Our heritage must live on. Our Ayurveda must thrive. God gives enough strength to people to save themselves. He also gives some enough strength to save their families. But he grants only some enough strength to save the whole society. If he has bestowed us with such knowledge and strength then it is our imperative duty to preserve it. You have never gone against my will. Please listen to me for the last time. Never step on this land again And never use this knowledge for business. Ayurveda is for upliftment of the whole world. Let it protect everyone. Take good care of him. Come Ratnakara come. Why did you come? You have saved millions of lives. You should live! Please leave. Ayurveda is above my flimsy life. And my family should live to protect it. They will pass on the ancient wisdom to next generations. Our family has always kept its promise. Bravo. You are as honest as Punyakoti. But I am not the good tiger of that story. You kept your promise. Now I should keep my word too. Let there be peace to all. I can't find Jagan anywhere. Mother. Mother. Where were you Jagan? Where were you my son? Get on the train Yashodha. Sir! Even my family owes a lot to yours! Both my parents were diagnosed with cancer Your family treated and cured them free of cost. No law came to rescue your family. But now no law will come to stop this impending destruction. I didn't ask you anything? You didn't tell me anything. We have never met. God be with you. I eavesdropped over your conversation with the SP. Only after listening to you I realised that my grandpa has been looking for you. In north In the desert is a guide to the blue city. He is your enemy. My brothers have gone to Rajasthan looking for you. The house has turned into hotel!! I thought you were a Buddha. But you are Krishna. Harbinger of Kurukshetra war. Your grandpa sacrificed his life to safe yours. Save your life. Never ever again use love to satisfy your vengeance. Go away. One minute. It was not in Rajasthan that I saw you for the first time. It was in Hyderabad at my friend's wedding. Happy married life. I will reach soon. Hey. I want to kiss you. What? Come let's have fun. Stupid. Give me one. You idiot! My love is as true as my vengeance. Grandpa. I have to talk to you. Speak. Shouldn't guests leave after couple of days? Taking advantage of one's hospitality is sick. From the day he has come, one or the other bad things keep befalling on us. Please throw him out. What happened? He is not behaving properly. I see a monster in him. My boss is proficient in Ayurveda. His medicine will dissolve your cough. My friend is an ayurvedic doctor. He taught me some medicine. There she is. Where were you Radha? Forget it. Come. Come Checkmate. Whom are you checkmating? To that king? To this Bhallala? Or to my granddaughter? My granddaughter, who never dared to speak before me spoke with me eye to eye today. Why? Who are you? Speak. Speak. Grandpa Will he confess that he came here for your granddaughter? Or will he confess that he is here for revenge? Or will he confess that he is the last link to your enemy Mahabala Ratnakara. You sent us to look for him. But he was here all the while. Please tell them to stop. He saved our life grandpa! My lord Near the temple. . . I beg you. Please leave my daughter. If that Bhallala is still a man. If he still has guts. Tell him to take her back without bringing any arms. Come. Leave her. Leave her!? People genuflected before Davangere Kusti Vardappa Nayaka. But you made us a parody. Look at my brother. I burnt three of our children You should feel the same agony when you see her die But after seeing you all together, I am having second thoughts. I want see your blood. Attack. What will I do if you hit them? My house has mourned for five deaths. I have tried twice to kill them. I had summoned 100 goons from Bihar. I am alive just to kill him. Fine. Since we both seek revenge we are brothers. Let's avenge it together. Bhallala! You didn't expect this right? What are you looking at? Chop them. Lover! Do you know why I spared you when you threatened me? Because you too hated them. But you are protecting them!!!! I spared you then Not today. Kill him first. Hitting doesn't matter. What matters is knowing where to hit and its impact. I have lost three lives because of him. I have lost 12 lives because of him. Hello brothers. If one of you is Pallava and the other Nayaka I am Bhallala. One who has mastered the art of war is Bhallala. Till now it was wrestling. Now there will be war. Rise. Are you shocked? You should be. This is Bhallala's fort. The moment you called me to this place, this place became mine. Kill them all. He is protecting both of us! After telling us not to hit he himself is thrashing them! I have read Mahabharata and Ramayana. But I am encountering such a character for the first time. Yes brother! Just because I called you brother doesn't mean we are one. Now he has turned to be the big brother. Look. Will you compensate? Will you compensate? Will you compensate? He saved the one he came to kill! Great. Jaganmohan Ratnakara. You saved me. But you killed my arrogance. I killed your whole family! But you saved my whole family. I believed that eye for an eye is the only revenge. But you taught me that forgiveness is the greatest revenge. Your grandpa said that his was the family of saviours. You proved him right. By saving me You have made me indebted to you my whole life. You won. Please forgive me. Please call your parents. Bhallala clan will always pay its dues to the Ratnakara clan. One From this moment all our wealth is yours. Two The love of my life The Mahalakshmi of our house my granddaughter. will be your concern. Come child. Three. For the rest of our lives my family will serve you. Repentance is the greatest penance. From this moment let us spend our wealth for the goodness of this world. Let us be as one family. Mr. Bhallala! What should we do if you people become one? I cheated you. Forgive me. Past is past. Let us live as brothers. Wow! My friend became a great man by saving their life and their souls! Fool. Is that what you think? He stole our girl’s heart and has now taken away all our wealth. After doing such good deeds why are you silent? Silence has its own sound. That sound is a prologue for a change In life only good people have Bharate (clout)
